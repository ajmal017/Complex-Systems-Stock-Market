47 2018-06-28 23:31:30 Pilgrim’s Pride and Hi-Crush Partners are stocks on my list that are  potentially undervalued. This means their current share prices are  trading well-below what the companies are actually worth.
48 2018-06-28 23:30:45 Depends on where the money came from. If it was rollover that was already in stocks, then I agree DCA isn’t the answer. If it’s money from heaven (lottery, inheritance) then DCA does make sense.
49 2018-06-28 23:30:21 You can have the best investment skills in the world, but if you don’t actually save money to invest, those skills won’t do you much good.

74 2018-06-28 23:04:31 The Co-op stocks at least 22 Halal lines inc Tahira 'Islamic' meats & lassi drinks.

131 2018-06-28 22:23:21 Unless you have stocks the store market doesn't help the lower and middle classes in full and that tax cut only came once but the rich and Trump get it for ten years and you pay the differ to continue it. Even Trump himself said that tax break and cut doesn't help middle class!
132 2018-06-28 22:22:15 Ban bump stocks now.

135 2018-06-28 22:21:46 RSI is that of XLE/OIL ratio. Very oversold and you see what happens each time we get this signal... Means energy stocks dont believe this OIL short squeeze

139 2018-06-28 22:20:14 Trump is tearing this country apart by pitting people against each other inciting violence and calling anyone who is not white a disease and infestation etc, What did he do about those bump stocks by the way? Another lie.

144 2018-06-28 22:15:17 Yeah, you’re right. I’ve got more money in pocket, my stocks are doing great, unemployment is low and I’ve got a President that cares about me and all of America first.  You’re right, that’s horrible. SMH 
145 2018-06-28 22:14:59 This is why as a rule I just won't talk about stocks I'm not in or bearish on, only ones I own/buy. Once I sell, I'm done talking about it. Major Douche-bag move imho to talk about stock u don't even own & potentially hurting actual shareholderslong $BYOC $SGDH $CELZ $DIRV

155 2018-06-28 22:07:53 Nothing wrong with tax bills. That's part of earning more money. Pay more tax. Still earn more money. Finding other investment opportunities to offset capital gains tax is key. Don't know too many successful traders that don't have other investments than just stocks.
156 2018-06-28 22:07:33 First time I’ve seen large motivated hedge buying despite modest realized vol in a long time .... among other things I think parallels to the Aug15 setup have managers worried (CNY lower, Chinese stocks grinding down for months, ...)

169 2018-06-28 21:58:14 To everyone who says gun control will take away our rights to the second amendment: 1. We only want to ban assault weapons and bump stocks, not all guns, as well as enact stricter background checks for owning guns. Nowhere in the second amendment does it state what KIND of (1/2)
170 2018-06-28 21:56:56 2) Surge into a stock. Monster Gap Ups. Big moves on bug volume and the follow through. It's for a reason they are ahead of other stocks in their sector and usually going up a lot faster than other stocks in the market. That's where you concentrate your money to get great returns

195 2018-06-28 21:39:28 Another mass shooting.  Will republicans only offer thoughts and prayers again?   Will @realDonaldTrump tell another lie about supporting a ban on bump stocks or raising the age of gun ownership?  How much will the @NRA pay #republicans now to support keeping the status quo?
196 2018-06-28 21:39:25 4.5 gdp, Isis gone, stocks all time high, Hispanic and black record low unemployment, 401k great, tax cuts, talking with N Korea, freed hostages, more military spending, fixing the VA, not sure what part of this is bad except for democrats

198 2018-06-28 21:38:12 27% in <6 months is a fare dip isn't it? Assuming it hit the high sometime this year, stocks like kaya liberty shoes sarda plywood archies etc are down much more I beleive though

229 2018-06-28 21:21:59 I think this would be a really good team meeting exercise to discuss
230 2018-06-28 21:21:07 The problem with shorting bank stocks, besides what will likely be a good earnings season, is the dividend carry just went up, and there may not be any shares to cover with when they get done buying back their businesses.
231 2018-06-28 21:20:56 Evening Market Wrap-up: stocks close higher rebounding from early lows. ENB and CL closed today earning combined 33% in Options. CC, OLN and CCK recovered from early session lows closing flat. SLCA closed lower looking to confirm support.
232 2018-06-28 21:20:49 Thoughts and prayers?  Are you afraid of the NRA?  Are still committed to banning bump stocks?  Do you still plan to advocate to raise the minimum age to purchase guns to 21.  Or are you just the complete liar and NRA shill that you’ve always been?
233 2018-06-28 21:20:18 But concentrating on productivity emphasises production not sales. eg if investment increases production and it is not sold then there are unused stocks. The dominant economic model is neo-classical endogenous growth theory. I was brought up on Lawson Mais lecture.

237 2018-06-28 21:17:53 The latest decline for the Xetra Dax was largely driven by losses for tech stocks — as well as carmakers — and helped push the pan-European Stoxx 600 down 0.8 per cent.  FT

239 2018-06-28 21:17:05 Time to buy cvs, walgreen, and rite aide stocks since it is low
240 2018-06-28 21:16:19 Michael is correct in that the ACLU opposed it. I actually see both sides of the issue. 

But what about ban on bump stocks and raising the min. age to 21?  Trump promised those. 

What about universal background checks? No fly list ban? What HAS the GOP done?  NOTHING

243 2018-06-28 21:13:19 @SenateMajLdr , @SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP @SenateGOP You are all responsible for the shooting deaths and injuries in Maryland today. You wouldn't even ban bump stocks. You are all useless. You all enable the monster, @realDonaldTrump. Save your thoughts and prayers. USELESS.
244 2018-06-28 21:12:27 for investors. Same concept with dividends. Dividends is just interest these companies pay for holding their stocks
245 2018-06-28 21:12:08 You don’t have to Buy stock in Amazon to invest in the stock market. Try some micro or small-cap stocks. You wouldn’t exactly be making a fortune but you wouldn’t be spending it either.
246 2018-06-28 21:12:01 There are too many guns in circulation now which means that any kind of ban or control wouldn’t work so now you need to try and prevent dangerous people from obtaining them. Trump has banned Bump Stocks which is more than Obama had done.
247 2018-06-28 21:11:35 Yeah, really a no vote on either side will work. Both sets of shareholders owned their respective stocks for the opposite reasons this deal was done. That’s why both stocks have sold off so hard.
248 2018-06-28 21:11:10 Guess time will tell. I remain cautious and am forcing my longs to be above their  20 day moving average. Watching stocks from most recent report for entries.
249 2018-06-28 21:10:50 Another bad deal! What do we expect from a failed businessman? Stocks falling, my company laying off people, trickle down never works! But you know that
250 2018-06-28 21:10:33 to short you have to barrow the shares and a lot of times retail brokers dont have shares to borrow of small cap stocks so you need a specialized broker that you can pay to locate shares of stocks to borrow that you want to short
251 2018-06-28 21:10:09 @staymaddening I spose you have a right to be a crybaby. He's better than ALMOST EVERY SINGLE POTUS EVER.

253 2018-06-28 21:08:22 Several banks are implementing the same strategy: boosting dividend and buying back stocks. What a bad timing. Considering the macro scenario and the risks we are dealing with, Fed should have recommended to increase the buffer to absorb possible losses without being bailed out
254 2018-06-28 21:08:18 Maybe for some people, but I think at the very end of the day, at least not selling big ass guns and bump stocks could be a step we should take.
255 2018-06-28 21:08:09 I had a doubt about this and reduced last week to 40% exposure, but I kept a couple of stocks mainly 'cos I had gains on them and they had not violated my exit criteria. Do you exit stocks manually even though their stops have not been reached if you see bad action in indexes?
256 2018-06-28 21:06:16 you might have, but quality stocks follow proper support and resistance levels. Penny stocks can dump and squeeze at any moment, if you're in with massive size the stress is not worth it. they're definitely not for new traders. there is a better way to trade
257 2018-06-28 21:06:09 Yea the growth is great not complaining i just think all stocks should give dividends 
258 2018-06-28 21:05:28 So tragic.  But don't judge md so quickly.  Banned bump stocks and passed red flag laws.  But that's not enough.  We need national gun safety laws.  And families will continue to get these calls until we do.  @realDonaldTrump @nra

315 2018-06-28 20:41:18 The players may be in agreement but unless we flat out see TOs agree then 2 stocks is fair game. We all just dont want to see TOs make silly decisions for convenience or whatever, like if the new For Glory is 2 stocks again with Ultimate there will be TOs using it for that reason
316 2018-06-28 20:40:47 Not sure I follow the logic. Trump himself is calling for more unconstitutional control by way of enhanced background checks and a prohibition on bump stocks. Not certain he will use the 2A stance as a litmus test, but we can certainly hope it is a strong consideration.

385 2018-06-28 20:07:13 Telecomms and tech lead stocks to close higher
386 2018-06-28 20:07:06 Lol dude that buy was literally .33% of my income. Not even 1%. I’m diversified in Reits, index’s, individual stocks, and currently flipping a house. Your whole “not a good buy” statement is PERSPECTIVE only and a short term invenstment mindset. I bought 12 more at $75. You mad?
387 2018-06-28 20:07:01 US stocks close higher on the day as financial shares (finally) rally: $DJIA +98, $SPX +17
388 2018-06-28 20:06:58 I’ve been in a fidelity meeting for 2 hours. I didn’t think fidelity was real. I didn’t think stocks were an actual thing. I didn’t think the IRS was real.
389 2018-06-28 20:06:51 Going to start TRYING to push myself to start swing trading options further out, like 3-4 weeks on oversold or overbought stocks.  the quick burn stuff hurts me more often than not.  :-o
390 2018-06-28 20:06:40 Really thinking about investing in stocks
391 2018-06-28 20:05:52 :: uh my dog keeps eating stuff that isn’t eatable.

He has eaten his toys and eat our stocks I need advice
392 2018-06-28 20:04:46 Actually, i wouldn't buy stocks by Tesla now ...
393 2018-06-28 20:02:50 Neopets stocks are mediocre at best today geez
394 2018-06-28 20:02:39 Can we have an update on stocks for the Butter? Numbers are different everywhere
395 2018-06-28 20:02:32 I have to agree on MagiMagi for this one. This is because you are forced to play more consistant with 3 stocks and upsets can still happen when you play with 3 stocks. This also means when you upset someone it's not some type of bullshit upset imo.
396 2018-06-28 20:02:18 FACT: The federal gov could eliminate ALL public debt today if the Fed bought up all Treasury bonds outstanding. (Interest rates would drop to 0, stocks & gold would likely rally)

FACT: It will NEVER pay it off via budget surpluses as those would guarantee disastrous depression.
397 2018-06-28 20:00:29 I don’t really trade much of anything, I just own some BTC.  Got some mutual funds for stocks.
398 2018-06-28 20:00:08 But the whole point is in Ultimate the stocks are quicker. So 3 stocks makes up for the time.
399 2018-06-28 19:59:28 $WMT per @CNBC report bumbled buying the same mailer pharmacy company $AMZN bought. Evident in the stocks today. Vision is important in biz.
400 2018-06-28 19:59:12 It reminds me of everyone who was preaching to sell all your stocks after the election because economic collapse was imminent.
401 2018-06-28 19:59:02 Hence a trade deficit.  That money does not create jobs.  That 98% of the $566 billion/year kept off shore, used to buy US companies/treasurary bills/stocks, but does not create jobs. 2% is used to create new US jobs.  Just the facts.
402 2018-06-28 19:58:21 This reminds me of the people that sold all their stocks after the trump election because economic collapse was certain.
403 2018-06-28 19:57:55 What about when they pp between stocks but never during the match? 
404 2018-06-28 19:56:11 An entertaining read chaps. I thought you went too easy on the Fresh Prince though. He should be locked in stocks and placed at the end of church st mall so we can all throw rotten fruit at him.
405 2018-06-28 19:56:05 3 stocks just seems way better from just how it looks itll play

412 2018-06-28 19:53:23 Been thinking that for a while.
413 2018-06-28 19:53:05 It's a variation on the Asness argument that "sin stocks" will outperform because they have a smaller pool of potential investors and thus price will rise as the supply of investors falls. Still seems mostly theoretical at this stage...

433 2018-06-28 19:40:02 La sensació és que els banc retenen sol i edificis per vendre. Ha pujat molt el preu perque no hi ha prou oferta.
Excel.lent per a ells que venen els seus stocks amb mercat alt.
Sempre guanyen.
La realitat és que els preus no poden pujar més.
434 2018-06-28 19:39:24 Anyone’s thoughts on medium term trading? Usually 1-2 months then exit. Looking to catch potential high momentum stocks using indicators, then getting out as the trend begins to die off
435 2018-06-28 19:38:29 Why haven't you banned bump stocks like you said you would?
436 2018-06-28 19:37:19 Qatar or UAE I’d guess. Qatar as part of the larger defense buildup and UAE must be running through their stocks of 155 in Yemen

440 2018-06-28 19:36:23 Lol I I know. I have this weird bias with NYSE stocks.
441 2018-06-28 19:35:57 LOL Possibility!
442 2018-06-28 19:35:56 Let's see how true that is when stocks crash later this year. I have a funny feeling that the Fed Put remains very much intact, it's just at a lower level. Remember, stock market = 150% GDP = US solvency via Fed Tax Receipts.
443 2018-06-28 19:35:24 #Stocks,#Indexes FAILED AGAIN! No SPX bottom.
444 2018-06-28 19:35:16 What have you done today to reunite the migrant families?

Why haven't you banned bump stocks like you said you would?
445 2018-06-28 19:34:17 Why haven't you banned bump stocks like you said you would?
446 2018-06-28 19:33:37 Agreed. No other choice. This is why when the stock market crashes later this year, the #Fed will have a choice between propping up stocks (Fed tax receipts, US solvency), USTs (alt is collapse of everything), or the dollar... obvious which they will choose imo.

461 2018-06-28 19:25:27 Stocks are off average 20% from their highs at a time when financials are better but are completely ignored, thank wall street scumlords for that. Easily could be up average 10%, so 30% hit mostly over overblown trade tariff talk, media scam yes but worth it, really? Do it better

521 2018-06-28 18:55:06 Well, we have had a series of rate hikes. Takes some time to kick in and have effect. Also, tax cut is now in rear view mirror.  And now we have trade wars and emerging markets are falling. And staples, REITSs & div stocks again showing signs of life.

527 2018-06-28 18:53:57 Algos = automated "smart' traders. Individual stocks reprice more quickly, rather than trending over the course of the day, which once enabled specialists/market makers to feast on the order flow. The fact middlemen can't profit as much now shows execution better/more efficient.

556 2018-06-28 18:37:45 I bet the difference between "kept the same" and "increased" in the two surveys has to do with whether people think the question is asking about stocks or flows, which would explain why the "decreased" percentage is similar in both surveys.

605 2018-06-28 18:19:25 The current sell off in equity markets is only stage 1 .where we r down 30-40% from highs .next will be stage 2 where over next 8-10 months stocks will fall another 30-40% .and then comes stage 3 .which is panic selling or capitulation..stocks will lose total 70-80% from highs
606 2018-06-28 18:19:21 Years ago the joke of commodity traders was that a trader who had big losses, making excuses to his wife saying, "but think how great it's going to be." Now analysts in media say, earnings will propel stocks higher, ignoring that they didn't last quarter. Hope is blind.

615 2018-06-28 18:13:59 I don't see any institutional panic.  The vol. has largely been light in many stocks on these pull backs.
616 2018-06-28 18:13:26 It's almost pointless. We've made our bet. The country is 9 years into this cycle, stocks/real estate/bond prices are high, credit has been easier than ever in history for longer than ever in history, and the Fed is tightening, When it ends it ends.
617 2018-06-28 18:13:10 $BABA bounces off the 200 (185.30ish). With nothing coming from Trump or China, it would probably bounce from here, as would all hot Chinese stocks like $IQ $BILI, etc. But y'know...

625 2018-06-28 18:09:56 The sad reality is this community is too stubborn it seems to ever change its' ways in core parts of the ruleset, which means whatever we start with as stocks will probably stay that way unless the community really hates it.

629 2018-06-28 18:07:31 If you watch charts carefully, most stocks that fall hard will do a bounce up to 50% before the next drop or climb. Going from 30¢ down to 18¢ and back to 27¢ (even temporarily) fits this pattern. Lots of reasons for why this happens, but it's a simple rule to consider.
630 2018-06-28 18:07:13 Ev1 wants 3 stocks because we're tired of losing half of our game in an extremely volatile match in a game where def>off.  In addition to that, 2 stock ruleset has actually caused players to be more campy/defensive due to how their character and game are made.

641 2018-06-28 18:04:04 Now tell me how my stocks did.
642 2018-06-28 18:03:34 I say it might need 4 stocks, but realistically it is too early to say.
643 2018-06-28 18:03:18 Yeah, but we don't have sufficient data to make that decision right now. If the game ends up being paced similarly to sm4sh then it should be 2 stocks. Everyone just wants 3 stocks because they think that they're going to do better.
644 2018-06-28 18:03:12 Trumpsters are pro life/pro bump stocks. 

How does that work, exactly?

645 2018-06-28 18:02:29 On UUUU and its new 52 Week high of today?  This is great for other sector stocks since Funds and Speculators are going to take note since this is significant and before a U3O8 rise.  More focus will come to UEC and URG and others in the coming days.  52 wk highs get attention!
646 2018-06-28 18:02:22 People probably just misconstrued it as an argument to keep Ultimate at 2 stocks as well. 
People needa chill. The game isn't even out yet, we have no idea as of now what the stocks should be. At the same time, as someone who hated 2 stocks in sm4sh I definitely fear it returning
647 2018-06-28 18:01:50 Any coin outside of the top 10 has a higher chance of being a scam and eventually failing. Trading or investing in them is like trading penny stocks. So unless you have experience doing that you will probably get rekt

672 2018-06-28 17:49:21 3 stock vs 2 stock is kind of a silly argument to have right now, and unless we can maintain a 5/6 minute format on 3 stocks we shouldn't pursue it. Scheduling a game around 8 minute format is a nightmare, and isn't worth it.
673 2018-06-28 17:49:06 Obviously we won’t agree, but IMO ban assault weapons, ammo, and bump stocks, which MASSIVELY reduces gun deaths in other countries.

681 2018-06-28 17:45:15 Many stocks have re-visted breakout points and it was painful for those we got in late.  That said, I'm not seeing the expansion of selling.  I think we go higher quickly -- of course, I reserve the right to change my opinion - and will do so quickly if I need to.

sm4sh with 3 stocks would be better for competitive and would lead to fewer upsets, but the pacing is just a tad slow
716 2018-06-28 17:30:24 Every time the stock market has declined, it eventually has more than fully recovered. Hedging the stock market by shorting stocks, or by buying puts on the S&P 500 Index, or any other method usually is expensive, and, in the long run, is a waste of money. -- Ed Wachenheim

770 2018-06-28 17:09:38 Today 414 stocks, mostly mid and small cap hit 52wk low,despite nifty is still just 5-7% off from its highs. Due to this layman is getting shattered.This will continue and it's difficult to catch its bottom.Investing fully in this stocks will be risky.Try MF and SIP route.

789 2018-06-28 17:01:54 Stocks down, the economy slowed more. Gross domestic product expanded at a 2.0% annual rate in the first three months of 2018, instead of the reported 2.2%, In a separate report, the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits increased by 9000 to 227,000.

791 2018-06-28 17:00:51 Biggest pain in this small and mid cap crash is not such fast erosion of value, rather it's the truth that some or many or all of such stocks in one's portfolio may never recover to their top again.

804 2018-06-28 16:52:14 That is exactly what we have been talking about. As Cliff points out, you can have a multi-decade stretch of value underperformance, and value stocks may still not be cheap (turnover!). It's the sharp drawdowns that create cheap value. I'm going to write a blog post about this.

There was one common message: Limit the downside in bad times.
840 2018-06-28 16:41:40 So annoying when people posts their stocks so often as if it was a secret stock and tag hedge fund managers etc. Example: $Sens. Searching for information and 90% are irrelevant multiple posts. 
841 2018-06-28 16:41:05 The reason I don't think people should use buy-and-hold: “If you can’t stomach watching your portfolio lose 50% of its value at any time, you shouldn’t be investing in stocks.”- Warren Buffet

853 2018-06-28 16:38:02 The economy would he in a zombie-like state if the FED starts again with this gimmick, so I am not so convinced at all OIL (same thing for stocks) could have any reason to go that high.

864 2018-06-28 16:34:09 Just guessing, but this isn't what the bottom of a bear market looks like. There should be obviously cheap stocks littered everywhere, because mostly everyone gave up, and the only thing holding you back is fear. I don't think we are there yet.

866 2018-06-28 16:32:51 if you see most stocks have strong support only at high made before demo, some more fall is likely.

I have no problem with trading of stocks or equity of company.

889 2018-06-28 16:24:42 I think for Midcap and Smallcap stocks, the only saviour would be the June quarter earnings, Shareholding pattern and the guidance for FY19 in the Annual reports. Let's hope most of the companies pass in this test 
890 2018-06-28 16:24:38 In The #Bonds Market: This caught me by surprise. @CMEGroup"FedWatch Tool" now shows a 11% chance of NO MORE RATE HIKES for rest of the year by December. Impact of #TradeWar fear, 2% growth in final US Q1 #GDP? Fed funds rate now at 1.75%-2% #investing #stocks @federalreserve
891 2018-06-28 16:23:28 Irony is ppl are celebrating Value Investing Farmer's stocks/PMS crashing , some of them hold Unitechs and Suzlons from 2007-08 
Typical Indian mentality ,either take /praise them to skies or laugh/ridicule when they are down !
892 2018-06-28 16:23:26 What about sorry???
893 2018-06-28 16:23:21 Correlations changing again.... gold , bonds, stocks all going down together... need to find some new hedge mechanism for portfolio.
894 2018-06-28 16:22:50 Glad to report c2C running tonight. Didn’t even see a glib pathetic apology for yesterday or this morning !!!
895 2018-06-28 16:22:30 @HalftimeReport @petenajarian is on it. If have wherewithal and do the research can blow off getting country ETF - Pick a few quality stocks in country interested in and allocate accordingly.
896 2018-06-28 16:22:27 I dont think its about ethics. In our view regulation is impprtant but it shpuld be outcomes based, not prescriptive. We need to create the right environment to ensure that firms feel empowered to create the right outcome for people - there will always be bad apples
897 2018-06-28 16:21:57 There’s that. There’s also the argument of caveat emptor vs straying into the realm of advice if guiding people too much (away from cash for example, as per this morning’s paper)
898 2018-06-28 16:21:50 3 stocks 6 mins
899 2018-06-28 16:21:47 Well they didn’t speak to Russell but $EFR did. Not their money, so they don’t care. It’s all about AUM for them. Very bad mgmt of the fund. And they are single handedly pushing these stocks down everyday. 6 months is too short to rebalance given liquidity
900 2018-06-28 16:21:26 Would avoid buying financial stocks. 
U.S. Treasury yields so no signs climbing higher and maybe or true, economic slowdown. Besides, concerns of bad loans outside U.S. And, world interest rate saw now inverted yield curve.

902 2018-06-28 16:20:22 Current legislation allows far too many the scope to say 'But I was only obeying the letter of the law guv' whilst knowing that what they are doing results in sub optimal outcomes.  It goes back to the F word.  Fiduciary.  

Three monkey money syndrome - see, hear, speak no evil.
903 2018-06-28 16:20:17 I meant other asset classes...I assume the same effect would hold for stocks in other geographies (if true)...was it tested in other country stock markets?

905 2018-06-28 16:19:44 Did you cash the cheques from the recent tours? Buy some IT stocks, will help you get over the depression! Any idea how other currencies have fared against the $? Tell the exporters WTF, see their reaction too!
906 2018-06-28 16:18:20 Comes down again to a failure of ethics - and you can't regulate to prevent unethical behaviour; you can only punish after the event IF there is evidence of loss. It's sad but true - just think of certain firms that still shaft consumers on cost yet get away with it.
907 2018-06-28 16:18:01 When you check the stock market and see that your most of your stocks just  jump 75 yes 
908 2018-06-28 16:16:54 Relative Strength Index 
The RSI computes momentum as the ratio of higher closes to lower closes: stocks which have had more or stronger positive changes have a higher RSI than stocks which have had more or stronger negative changes. Is RSI important? it’s a signal of strength.
909 2018-06-28 16:16:49 The top five stocks lower at noon today are $WBA. $CMG, $CVS, $MCK, and $CAH.

912 2018-06-28 16:16:06 It is interesting that after the worst value bear market on record, value stocks are not screaming cheap. And I would put more faith in cheapness than relative underperformance to predict forward returns.

922 2018-06-28 16:13:55 European Stocks benchmarks lost ground, extending their drop for the week as investors remain concerned that trade-related fights could turn into a big drag on the global economy.

932 2018-06-28 16:11:49 Yeah? Well, so far not much luck. Fargas stocks up with JUCO players who, at best, are with the program 2 years. Her attrition rate is horrible & our best player from last year transferred to Baylor! Elite? When? Still waiting.

946 2018-06-28 16:04:37 What about those who are not con artist, ie the FCA has yet again felt the need to intervene after d2c consumers were not served properly by providers. Can they be trusted or do we need more prescriptive regulation?
947 2018-06-28 16:04:22 I find CRA some what confused being charged tax on stocks you have not sold is wrong but that's what is happening. It will discourage any foreign investments outside of Canada.

959 2018-06-28 16:01:08 Like bonds, stocks, mortgages...
960 2018-06-28 16:01:00 I find the "ETFs temp people to over trade" critique a bit overwrought. Most mutual funds trade *daily*. Stocks trade in milliseconds. On the flip, it's not like funds that give discounts for quarterly redemptions are widespread.
961 2018-06-28 16:00:43 Stocks?
962 2018-06-28 15:59:25 $SPY looks like it wants to test key technical level for a second time today. Interesting price action, watching the bond market like a hawk while minimizing risk exposure slightly. #equities #Stocks #StockMarket
963 2018-06-28 15:59:03 Do your self a favor, just avoid deliberate chor-bane-mor stocks and you'll do just fine once the market moves up. Once in a while you might end up with mor-bane-chor stocks. It's just bad luck, even there allocation would save you from death blow. #2cents

986 2018-06-28 15:52:42 $VIX near 18 still, $DXY about to go positive for the day.  $EURUSD can barely hold an uptick, commodities besides WTI have broken lower.  Am I worried about stocks bouncing here? Hardly

988 2018-06-28 15:52:30 Investors should educate themselves on trading $TVIX. The #ETN tracks the inverse of the S&P 500 but swings wildly in either direction in comparison to small moves made by $SPXL. $TVIX is up nearly 45% for the WEEK compared to $SPXL being down only 5%. #trade #invest #stocks

1014 2018-06-28 15:45:05 Pre-freedoms, ISA usually secondary source of income to pension, now typically prior to pension (i.e. subject to personal allowance being used).

For some, ATR on pension assets therefore adjusted up and ATR reduced on ISA as now more likely to draw on ISA than pension.

1025 2018-06-28 15:42:11 Assuming investment ISA vs pension I don't see any additional risk?

Those at pension age unlikely to see ISA assets all that differently to pension assets. They're just accumulated wealth. 

Post freedoms we've revisited ATR on both and I've yet to have a client differentiate.

1031 2018-06-28 15:40:57 Such a good time to invest in mid & small caps! It should be easier to buy stocks when they are beaten down, but somehow human nature only allows us to invest when valuations are sky-high. Should buy potatoes when they are cheap!

1034 2018-06-28 15:40:02 You think stock indexes will bottom in at July &then bounce from there? An 8% drop would be to $2480.  Its not an obvious support zone the Feb low would be broken. Why would stocks not move lower? Also such a large drop would be a different pattern to the fractal. Thoughts?
1035 2018-06-28 15:39:44 And we know most of them voted for Remain, central London voted Remain, according to reports, Rich higher educated professionals voted Remain, so by that I’m guessing Remain voters made more gambling on stocks and currency.

1062 2018-06-28 15:31:43 A point comes when the super pricey stocks do not even compound. I would better buy a stock which can fall 50% from my purchase price, but would give me decent return in the next bull cycle. This is the time to show conviction and back it up with a plan

1072 2018-06-28 15:28:29 People need to realise that bear phases are meant for accumulation. Decent appreciation can only be had in a bull market. Rather than locking myself up in super pricey stocks for appreciation, better to use that cash for gradual accumulation.

1079 2018-06-28 15:27:22 I think that's a point of disagreement with us. I don't buy the idea that asset markets get overvalued. I think there relationship between markets and trend GDP growth is simply widely misunderstood. This is my area of modeling, particularly regarding stocks.
1080 2018-06-28 15:26:42 A wise portfolio manager once said to me, "In this business stocks trade on a pendulum between the big 10s and the little 10s."  The big 10 is 10x revs.  The little 10 is 10x earnings.  Right now I see a whole lot more big 10s than little 10s.  Wonder when that pendulum swings?
1081 2018-06-28 15:26:39 News reports talking about NRI bond to give support to INR... Such artificial moves will be really detrimental to country's interest as defending a level be it currency or stocks will accelerate fii outflow.. hope good sense prevail & v let mkt determines its own levels.

1094 2018-06-28 15:23:09 Not convinced that’s true. People open ISAs for all sorts of reasons. We’re talking about freedom for pensions including workplace savings. If someone chucks their ISA, the risks are very different to that of a pension.

1169 2018-06-28 15:02:09 probably has something to do w how USD behaves (ie if USDJPY goes to 100, Japanese equities will fall further)... but anyway, not a chance that ex-US stocks go up.  Now there's also a non-trivial chance that the US move comes from a constitutional (or appearing so) crisis
1170 2018-06-28 15:02:07 A week in the stocks...?
1171 2018-06-28 15:02:04 Possibly but I wouldn’t be looking long stocks if you’re day trading especially after the Dow still sub 200DMA. Other indexes should sink some more. Any move up now could be a trap

1318 2018-06-28 14:19:37 I honestly don't mind it, because I actually made a 20% gain within 20 minutes. Kind of need that volatility with penny stocks if you want to make money, at least if you are on the right side of it.

1460 2018-06-28 13:29:36 It's easier to trade stocks you're familiar with, get to know behavior. Look for quality trades and entry points. Don't just buy anything. Sometimes the best trade is 1 not taken. Know what to look for. Don't worry about missed opportunities - there'll be another.

1579 2018-06-28 12:42:09 All could equally apply to ISA (i.e. purchase life annuity). 

Totally agree the risks are three BUT playing devils advocate about how taking cash out of an ISA has no such considerations.

Tbf more 'tax risk' with bond withdrawals due to the 'wonderful' chargeable event regime.

1601 2018-06-28 12:35:07 I'm addressing people who feel guns should be permitted everywhere, that restrictions should be rolled back because it infringes on their right to bear arms (even if they don't belong to a well regulated militia), that assault style rifles are necessary and bump stocks are okay.
1602 2018-06-28 12:33:29 Looking for strongly trending stocks that have had a recent short term consolidation. They can be conducive toward swing trading but yes, my preference is to hit & run. Go home flat & stress free.
1603 2018-06-28 12:30:53 Personally, I feel there's too much focus on the shift from accumulation to decumulation.

If someone stops funding an ISA and instead starts to drawdown, consider that advice process to that of pension drawdown.

Only difference is the tax wrapper.

1654 2018-06-28 11:57:33 Today one of the stocks we own dropped over 7%. However, since our risk per trade is less than 0.5%, this got absorbed by the other stocks where we are short. Single stock risk gets mitigated due to non-correlated strategies and position sizing #Risk #Management #Is #Key

1656 2018-06-28 11:55:53 I don't believe a bailout will help. HD might pretend they've a wide range but are all variations of the same bike essentially. The market for that is ageing and dying.

1661 2018-06-28 11:54:52 In a down-market, we tend to look at what has fallen most, which stocks have hit yearly low etc, in order to find stuff to buy.
What we don't realise is that more often than not, the best ideas to buy are already in our portfolio. Be selective, buy more! Don't be distracted.

I think it's a sign of the times that pickings are so slim value guys have to go this far afield.
1722 2018-06-28 11:13:29 A smarter long term strategy is to say 100 percent invested in stocks.  A broadly diversified portfolio.

Sadly, I have seen once great agricultural counties completely devoid of any planning for both sectors.

1735 2018-06-28 11:04:46 It might not be. In fact, on longer time frames these Markets still look very bullish. In short term many Stocks like #AV. been beat up and weak £ could boost UK Stocks.
1736 2018-06-28 11:04:18 Next month US eco data will dictate if current US$ strength has further to go. In my opinion the risk of negative surprises is high as the current trade spat filters through the US economy. Higher oil price and weakness in stocks to impact consumer sentiment.

1760 2018-06-28 10:46:05 Stocks are performing well so the safe haven of gold has minimal appetite, sending it lower.

1763 2018-06-28 10:40:28 The tactic in fundamental investing is very different from technical investing. When you say stocks, which stocks are you referring to?
1764 2018-06-28 10:38:49 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. 131
1765 2018-06-28 10:37:51 Too much supply of money in late '90s via IPO's led to a supply glut of fiber optics, etc... A drop in stocks (an asset) triggered the unwind. Too much supply of credit led to too many homes and a decline in home prices (an asset) led to the unwind. Unlike the previous 48.
1766 2018-06-28 10:37:31 Did you have to stock pile them in your hotel room with ammo and bump stocks.... sounds familiar....

1953 2018-06-28 07:57:07 Agree. 2008 was more to do with Lehman and mortgage fall.  New investor haven't experienced the falls. Many late entrants facing market wrath and are clueless. They still trying to average junk stocks with a hope to see ATH rather then cutting loss.
1954 2018-06-28 07:56:40 Chinese stocks are in a bear market and its currency has fallen to the lowest level this year.

1955 2018-06-28 07:56:32 Money put into stocks = investing in a company. A company can take that money and expand. New construction (Amazon HQ), more jobs (50,000), more products at cheaper prices (TVs for $200 not $2000) which grows GDP. Everyone benefits, especially consumers.

1960 2018-06-28 07:53:43 Some may say SBI, IOC are good value stocks now. But risk factors like poor governance by GoI, merging crap PSU banks, reducing market margin and raising excise etc exists. These are completely against minority shareholders interest. So individual perception matters.

1976 2018-06-28 07:39:25 Volatility should be because of non controllable reasons. But here we have issues with mass corporate governance, government forcing buys, every policy targeting retail investor( ex. Only 1lakh limit on profit), putting stocks in monitoring list too late(if required).

1990 2018-06-28 07:23:48 Fully agree. Last year, the majority of my high quality stocks underperformed in a bull market. Only a few commodity stocks in the portfolio like bhansali engineering and HEG did superbly. But in 2018, the quality stocks have helped a lot (with the exception of Avanti Feeds).

2185 2018-06-28 04:53:37 Una muestra más de que hay serias deficiencias en la enseñanza de teoría monetaria en nuestras universidades.

2186 2018-06-28 04:53:18 They took their own decision to invest in stocks which they only selected. When stocks went up they didn't come to me & tell "Gopal, pls take a share of our profits". So why tell me/abuse me when they are in a loss? This is what happens when we buy/trade in poor quality stocks.

2195 2018-06-28 04:47:19 Are you still doubting? Index is artificially kept high. This bear market to continue till 2019 elections and even after that if there is no majority govt after elections. Every bear market will have some stocks or sectors going up. This time it is consumption and some others.
2196 2018-06-28 04:46:51 Helping Unions, how? By starting trade wars? By giving tax breaks to the uber wealthy elites so they can buy back their stocks?  By "saving" manufacturing jobs, to see them leave anyway a la Carrier?
2197 2018-06-28 04:45:57 Last 150 days many small cap & midcap stocks  many became cheaper large caps still holding markets

2203 2018-06-28 04:39:57 There were large number of midcap stocks which were trading at 50-60 P/E with earnings growth of 15-18%..importantly earnings growth was supported by margin expansion led by operating and financial leverage and not necessarily by volume and sales growth. Mr. Naren had forewarned.
2204 2018-06-28 04:39:09 We all know what’s going to happen, last minute Britain walks, EU and British stocks crash, 2 weeks later compromise and deal! And we all live happily ever after, apart From remoaners who’ll be banging on about it for years!
2205 2018-06-28 04:36:51 In our market, notwithstanding so much of weakness even now, I am expecting a short-term bottom could well be formed in broader market stocks; #Nifty is the theatre of the absurd, it does not reflect the market anymore. Its behaviour resembles with that of Roman Emperor Nero.
2206 2018-06-28 04:36:27 I have been consistent in my analysis over the years: two medium-term indicators (the averages & leaders) and two long-term signposts (the financials and breadth). The latter two are notable. Long-term a bear, medium-term hopeful #stocks

2211 2018-06-28 04:32:48 I have a slightly different personal approach. During sudden mindless selloff periods like the ones currently, I start actively researching stocks again and also review my pf. Book reading and learning anyways continues at it's own sweet pace irrespective of market conditions :)
2212 2018-06-28 04:31:35 I think you're doing ok my friend.  

I can see some good setups on some of those stocks you mentioned, you are focused on risk control, and your instincts seem good.

Keep working your numbers and you'll be fine.

2215 2018-06-28 04:30:43 O’Neil strongly recommends to sell only if 10week/50d is broken on high volume and that too wait for Friday to see if it closes in the upper half. How do you deal with that versus 20 dma? Is a break of 20 ema a sell signal for your position stocks also?
2216 2018-06-28 04:29:51 Sir, as you have seen many such (and perhaps more deadlier) corrections, i would like to know your approach towards the market. Apart from taking the MF route. do you avg the stocks you're holding or sell them to protect your profits?
2217 2018-06-28 04:28:51 “Got my rubber stamp ready, Dear Leader!”
2218 2018-06-28 04:28:19 Right!! All my money went to these rich fucks so they could buy back their company stocks!!!
2219 2018-06-28 04:27:53 Every market cycle is different.
If I were to hazard a guess it will be cooling down of valuations in experience stocks. Not necessarily collapse of stocks like the earlier bear markets.
So maybe the FMCG, NBFCs will see time & value corrections.

2223 2018-06-28 04:26:13 That I agree with. Life is a continuing series of whose ox is being gored and it was Harley's ox. I know HD workers are pissed off and speaking out. The head of a publicly traded company has to be careful doing that because most stocks are held by mutual funds. His ox.
2224 2018-06-28 04:25:54 Well u don't answer about specific stocks.. So why ask?
2225 2018-06-28 04:25:36 I know how the coal stocks were built up my dad had a coal haulage business. The coal stocks were always built up because the unions were always striking. Stocks had to be managed for the long haul
2226 2018-06-28 04:25:35 Splendid analyse, but there is sumething strange because US stocks and US bonds are both dollar assets(hawkish fed) so everybody sells dollars when both are lower ?

2280 2018-06-28 03:55:06 While doing Data analysis, a trader always need to look at the sequence of built-up. OI and Price data can provide lot of good information. Also blending it with Option data, IV placements together can give some good insights on the movement happening in the stocks.

2298 2018-06-28 03:38:29 Probably this has been the case “mostly” since last 10-15year

2322 2018-06-28 03:31:07 At first I was wondering your choice of stocks to short - why NFLX and WTW, not weaker leaders such as NVDA or BABA.   Rewatched the trading video.  It now makes sense.  Near to psychological levels & far from nearest base. Hence, huge potential reward vs risk if proven correct.
2323 2018-06-28 03:30:42 Another reservation I have about buying the newsletter is that I believe a mild recession is approaching 2019-2021, do you see commodity stocks performing well during a mild recession? Or do you not believe at least a mild recession is approaching?

2325 2018-06-28 03:29:16 I'll answer that for you... the stocks will drop. True bikers will buy their own frames and grind the serial numbers off. Build their own bikes.  Harley Davidson Corporate will suck eggs like Fender did.

2392 2018-06-28 02:52:14 It's such a sad little model it's probably lots of things. But I think this is largely stocks vs. flows. Performance is about to getting raises/promotions; which is what people with lower salaries want to do.

2432 2018-06-28 02:21:09 U.S. Market Check

U.S. stocks fell to the lowest level since May and Treasuries rallied amid renewed concern that the Trump administration will crack down on Chinese investment.

The yield on 10-year Treasuries held at 2.83 percent after falling five basis points.
2433 2018-06-28 02:20:36 Asian stocks fell Thursday and the yen pushed higher as traders remained skeptical about the Trump administration’s announcement of less harsh measures on Chinese investments.
2434 2018-06-28 02:20:30 Right, big Corps are suddenly going to get altruistic. Most tax cut $$’s are going to stock buybacks anyway. Definitely good for me but doesn’t help the regular guy. Most Americans don’t own stocks. 40% don’t have $500 in savings. Debt ballooning.
2435 2018-06-28 02:20:18 If u r in this market with 10 yrs horizon even now u can pick up good stocks to average out... remember if u found value in a stock at 500 there is no way u shudnt buy it when it's at 350.. identify those good ones n keep buying thru SIP mode

2454 2018-06-28 02:07:52 In one day we’ve discovered:
1. Trump’s 2017 corporate tax cuts have resulted in a record-setting buyback of stocks for shareholders across the US, rather than more wages.
2. Kim Jong-Un and the DPRK are developing weapons at an accelerated pace. 
Great work, @realDonaldTrump!!
2455 2018-06-28 02:07:19 Stocks are hard to come by. Especially when I first started publishing. There were hardly any Asian women models. Now there are a few and I grab them up by the handful when they get new ones out.

2457 2018-06-28 02:06:29 Just when everyone expecting market is to bleed, it does not pay heed. Market moves can't be expected or anticipated they should be managed. Focus on your stocks and let markets do what it wants to. Markets are not obedient, they are illusive, like a serpent in grass.
2458 2018-06-28 02:05:15 If I’m in a bad mood it’s probably because my stocks are down. 
2459 2018-06-28 02:04:32 Which is typically true of many high beta stocks into earnings as well. Rarely, if ever, worth holding through with the huge expectations on the earnings event.

2465 2018-06-28 01:59:27 So value underperforms, and new value stocks are not necessarily cheaper but continue to underperform? This is a pretty subtle point for the layman. I need to think about this. Looks like I have my morning reading all set up now! Thanks, I knew I could count on you, Cliff!
2466 2018-06-28 01:55:34 The nice thing abt #TWTR is u don't need 2 know prices, u can tell when stocks are moving  or  by who is silent & when they are busy pounding themselves on the back. Letter writers who offer "freebies" when they go silent u know mkt is  & they r getting hammered. $SPX
2467 2018-06-28 01:55:22 It would be cool to see Ultimate be 3 stocks. Smash 4 pretty much was 2 stocks from the get go so it will be interesting to see some experimentation with 3, and hopefully it sticks

I'm moving 50% of my stocks to treasuries and bonds.
2478 2018-06-28 01:48:43 Its really tricky. I am invested only where I have a longer view (2 years+). We have headwinds currently on macro and political front. Despite good results, stocks might still come off. Hotel sector looks good for some time. But again, has been a difficult sector for investors.
2479 2018-06-28 01:47:47 Bruh I can’t finish stocks for my life

2519 2018-06-28 01:09:10 I’m just saying that bayo combos just get hate coz air side b and witch twist are get out of jail free cards that convert into stocks for no reason. For me, I don’t like that they can straight take your stock out of disadvantage state. It’s way more annoying than any grab combo
2520 2018-06-28 01:09:03 I think it is an obsolete rule like you and bio sector stocks are evolving with all of the grants and Trump as President

Do it because America deserves a good show.  Also, I own popcorn stocks.
2522 2018-06-28 01:08:28 I sorta hope it stays 3 stocks. Of course I suppose that's also because I started with brawl competitively so it appears more to me because that's what I was used to for 6 years lol.

2524 2018-06-28 01:06:48 My cautionary hypothesis has been that until you can damage the Generals, the stocks in $NYFANG etc, there is a limit to the downside because their strength gives comfort to the bulls. Think of it as a General riding up and down front line on a horse. $SPX $NDX $IWM

2528 2018-06-28 01:04:34 $SPY How soon we forget that many stocks just recently traded at new all time highs. These things go in cycles. Open mind. :)
2529 2018-06-28 01:03:23 @modern_rock when someone talks about trading float not volume is that because like u say not to short stocks on day one that rotate float is that because the shorts that are holding make the float smaller? Sorry if that doesn’t make sense
2530 2018-06-28 01:02:23 Hahahahahahahahaha.
Ban bump stocks, buddy.
Whatever.
But: you do realize that if you file down the firing pin in a weapon, it accomplishes the same thing, right?
And you can’t ban files.
This isn’t Britain.
So: tell me again, what will banning bump stocks accomplish?
2531 2018-06-28 01:02:01 China stocks in Correction mode due to Trade War. Once trade deal done they move up.
2532 2018-06-28 01:01:16 Not a big deal but hit a milestone.  My first triple digit profit day trading stocks.   It's been a long journey but I finally feel like it's finally starting to come together..

2534 2018-06-28 01:00:51 Toward the end of the 1920's the stock market was becoming increasingly more unstable due to practices like day trading and buying on the margin. Stocks were overvalued because because the value of the companies had been sold, people were buying unvalued stock. #GGC18HIST3225

2539 2018-06-28 00:54:59 I’m trying to look into healthcare subsidiaries but I don’t what to invest in that area. On a different note I heard there was they were making medical marijuana legal in Canada and if you have stocks in this company you’ll expect to make a lot of money. I think it’s called ATTBF
2540 2018-06-28 00:53:00 Liberal Party airlines has gone into liquidation, owing to pilot error. Stocks are nosediving with shareholders quickly grabbing parachutes. #auspol

2542 2018-06-28 00:52:16 My aunt retired early in life (52) after making a fortune on stocks. She predicted last year that the Dow could fall back into the 19000s under Trump.
2543 2018-06-28 00:51:54 Goal for the end of the yr: invest at least $1,500 into stocks.
2544 2018-06-28 00:51:53 Ban bump stocks!!
2545 2018-06-28 00:50:14 Stocks are the only thing nobody wants to buy on sale.

2550 2018-06-28 00:45:43 Yes, since every trade has a buyer and seller (when someone decides to sell foreign stocks someone also takes other side of that trade and decides to buy foreign stocks).   Thus, in my mind, conviction of buyer and seller is what moves markets.
2551 2018-06-28 00:45:31 How many of Trump's buddies are shorting stocks while he scares the market with bluster and BS trade war, just to reverse himself later??
2552 2018-06-28 00:44:37 We can agree on this. Because the establishment Democrat Party is a Wall Street elite party, and they love them some defense stocks on Wall Street. Goes back to FDR and LBJ. Clinton had a hard on for cruise missiles so we had to buy more, and Obama loved drones.

2559 2018-06-28 00:40:46 You do realize those people wrapped up in tin foil in warehouses were all under Obama, right? If you're going to lie, you really need to get better at it.

2561 2018-06-28 00:38:06 You do realize that you are being lied to, right?
2562 2018-06-28 00:37:07 I pay all my taxes. I’m typically quite healthy and rarely require expensive medical procedures. I would be one of the “robbed” and I’d happily pay more to increase the overall quality of life. The VA is a bad microcosm. There are legit other countries that do this and do it well
2563 2018-06-28 00:35:44 Excited to co-host @SquawkCNBC tomorrow (Thursday) from 6-7am! #investing #stocks #stockmarket
2564 2018-06-28 00:35:13 Also, answer me this:

What exactly entitles you to the time, labor, and private property of others so you can get healthcare provided to you? What makes your life infinitely more valuable than the lives of others you wish to see robbed by gov.
2565 2018-06-28 00:33:44 I’ve noticed you’ve been posting a lot of lower priced names. Do you look for lower priced stocks when the overall market is choppy? Thanks!
2566 2018-06-28 00:33:42 Pregnancy via rape or incest is about the only way I would ever justify use of tax dollars. With that aside, voluntary sexual dalliances of utter carelessness should be paid for strictly by the parties involved. Period.
2567 2018-06-28 00:33:10 30 minutes until @BHOAdventures stocks his store y'all get ready its going to be very fast hurry up and get your fingers ready
2568 2018-06-28 00:32:02 Absolutely not. The VA is a classic example of a top heavy bureaucracy engaged in providing socialized medicine. They can't even do that right. Why in God's name would we want our health care in the hands of incompetents? cont..

2573 2018-06-28 00:28:59 I believe this time might be different. There could be a lag time once logistic problems occur within a company's supply chain. It is the corporation that will change. I believe transport stocks are an indicator of economic change. Too many governments are involved this time.
2574 2018-06-28 00:27:45 Aside from my goal of one day working in Human Resources, I really wanna be a MUA !! I also wanna own my own business!! I also want to be a role model to young women !!! I want to share my story  I want to invest in stocks! I have so much planned 
2575 2018-06-28 00:27:39 The pain subsides but the scars remain forever. Why do investors lose money? It’s because the risk/reward is imbalanced. Low priced stocks have higher risk. Quality, growth, earnings are a must. They try to buy 100000 shares for .10 and hope for the best.
2576 2018-06-28 00:26:42 @TradeStation Why we can't short anything? All the gap up/down $stocks are hard to borrow! Basically anything with volume in the morning has a huge HB next to it and you people can never locate any shares! Closing account, useless. Going back to @IBKR

2580 2018-06-28 00:25:43 Tangentially related: I went to a Stocks For Tots charity event in Mooresville in December '97. We waited in a long line to get Rusty Wallace's autograph until a Penske employee told everyone that Rusty had a "rough day" testing the new Taurus and didn't feel like signing.
2581 2018-06-28 00:22:41 Clearly, stockmatusow, you are not a lawyer or if you are one, you should not have passed the bar. Any SCOTUS decision can be overuled by a future majority of justices. Kennedy was the key fifth vote in a 5-4 decision rejecting an attempt to overule Roe. STICK TO STOCKS

2586 2018-06-28 00:20:30 PerEden said “most” for that exact reason. And it’s possible that in those games they pulled an upset in, they had just gotten to a level where they would have earned that win regardless or 2 stocks
2587 2018-06-28 00:19:44 if following the money was the order of the day how about finding out who shorted airline stocks in the days preceeding 9/11. Find that out and plus how the hell did the 3rd building fall and you know who dunnit. the yanks might end up banning themselves from going anywhere.
2588 2018-06-28 00:19:41 So is any knowledge in general...but your publication stocks literally zero of it.
2589 2018-06-28 00:19:37 But why didn’t so many billionaires run away if NPA’s were so higher in the years gone by (over 36 gone as per the Govt)? Why bank stocks of all PSU’s combined are lower than 1 HDFC now and not earlier? And why Rupee is worse today when oil is lower, reserves are higher? Hmmm
2590 2018-06-28 00:19:25 Milkshakes, soups, virgin drinks, protein drinks, virgin cocktails, if approved regular cocktails, if approved, straight alcohol, Hot cocoa is good, apple cider, soups, bisques, stocks,, if approved anything with a very subtle texture then maybe some chinese egg soup?

2593 2018-06-28 00:19:00 Eh, I think taxpayer money can and should (and has been demonstrated to do just fine at) funding ALL healthcare. And there are a LOT of prospective abortions that aren’t “voluntary sexual escapades” unless you think that’s what rape is...
2594 2018-06-28 00:18:52 Market given its verdict so far who is more impacted by the trade wars with the S&P down just -0.2% for the month and Nikkei quietly just -1% in USD while China domestic indices -11%.

2596 2018-06-28 00:18:33 Yeah, stocks are falling, CBO states that a recession is probably gonna happen due to this taxscam...
2597 2018-06-28 00:17:40 "Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in corrections themselves." 

Even for high quality stocks, they have suffer drawdown but they do bounce back quickly as well.

2606 2018-06-28 00:14:45 Well you didn't exactly state that originally. You used a broad brush. That aside, to answer your statement: Nor should it ever be. Taxpayer money should never be used for a voluntary sexual escapade.
2607 2018-06-28 00:13:44 As a Minister of the Crown, she has no business extolling the virtues of CPP's investment decisions!  She has to be neutral in these issues!

2612 2018-06-28 00:03:33 Banning access to assault weapons, bump  stocks, or machine guns is not an infringement of our 2nd  amendment rights. That's an NRA interpretation to allow all weapons to be owned by the public.  The NRA profits from the sale of each firearm.
2613 2018-06-28 00:03:06 I don’t know if owning nothing but mj stocks and mj warrants is a portfolio. Listen to your wife more(as painful as that may be). Draw a line in the sand. Been in the biz 35 ffffing years and never lost $85m in 3 days. Hope the bleeding stops for you. Stay cool.
