45 2018-02-08 23:57:42 Because we haven‚Äôt done anything wrong except try and protect our pristine coast from dirty tar sand oil.

50 2018-02-08 23:57:25 The point is YPG are Kurds who do not belong to DeirEzzor. Autoctone Arabs in Deir Ezzor oppose 100% the US/Kurds carnival. Again: US air lifted Kurds there to occupy oil/gas fields and prevent Syrian people to regain their own homeland

52 2018-02-08 23:57:23 Motivation?  So the US can have secure and easy access to discount oil. This has nothing to do with environmental concerns.
53 2018-02-08 23:57:16 Are you joking?? I think you disregarded public comments on every one of the sloppy moves you made. I think who you are listening to is big oil/gas.

Energy independence would be great. It doesn't take oil to get there.Continuing dvlpmnt of alternative energy sources will not only give the nation greater energy independence, it also provides that opportunity for individuals.
112 2018-02-08 23:50:29 Coal is dying. Regulations protect people from corporate negligence. Abstinence only education doesn't work. Not everything can or should be privatized.

If you're carb loading, this extra fat is terrible.
127 2018-02-08 23:48:47 A serious spill on the BC Coast would bankrupt Alberta if they were held accountable for cleanup costs. Pipelines export jobs, why not force Big Oil to establish a refinery in Fort Mac and keep the processing jobs in Canada...eh?

141 2018-02-08 23:47:04 The peoplekind comment, on its own, is goofy but not particularly bothersome. But it is an indication of further extreme left progressive behavior, such as policy on pipelines, oil and gas, demanding progressive clauses in trade pacts, all things that will devastate the economy.

So because U voice anti-Obama sentiments & Ur trying2 make a living off dealing in oil from 1 of the world‚Äôs largest producers, & that requires you to fraternize with Russians, you‚Äôre a Russian operative? That makes all Americans doing business in Russia spies.  Ridiculous.
144 2018-02-08 23:46:49 And the great western society stands back and watches it going on. Always thought we stood up for persecuted people, but then again no oil to go after

147 2018-02-08 23:45:56 We could have had this decades ago but oil companies wanted money. Makes no sense cause you can have ENDLESS amounts of free wind, solar and water power. We are not in the 1900s people.

154 2018-02-08 23:45:05 although I like the smell, you can dilute it with a carrier oil like vitamin E which is also good for your skin!
155 2018-02-08 23:44:51 why did oil on water just come on
156 2018-02-08 23:44:51 We could do it, but the Earth is an amazing source of pressure containment. The tunnels solve the problem.

I hope we can rehabilitate the pipelines of the Earth for some nobler purpose than the extraction of oil. Water would be a good place to start.

166 2018-02-08 23:43:43 Whats fascinating about this macro-led correction across risk assets is that, if the fear on inflation is triggering this move, then this should support commodities. Its the leveraged positions that are getting cut in the sell-off, rather than oil specific.

267 2018-02-08 23:29:28 The only country who doesn't drill off our shores is the US. The BP oil spill in the gulf of Mexico was a British Petroleum oil drilling platform after all.
268 2018-02-08 23:29:23 oil traders
269 2018-02-08 23:29:13 And money leaves the province/country to pay for imported fuel while young people leave the province to work in oil and gas jobs in Alberta.
270 2018-02-08 23:29:10 I find it hilarious how some people still think it can be a world without oil , gas, plastic & rubber.
271 2018-02-08 23:29:09 As someone with a chronic illness who had to wait more than a year to get into the public pain management clinic I can possibly understand why people would be searching for other options. When private is prohibitively expensive & public takes forever: snake oil salesmen boom

273 2018-02-08 23:28:47 Deepwater is indicitive of what uber large Oil companies do, even just 2 save some pocket change they didn't bother 2 install the correct safety valve
The Kalamazoo spill in Michigan by an Enbridge pipeline was more recent, & aging infrastructure in pipelines has little oversight
274 2018-02-08 23:28:45 Because US needs oil of Deir ez-Zor.

275 2018-02-08 23:28:26 Pedicure while I wait for an oil change, don't mind if I do! 
276 2018-02-08 23:28:26 Exactly. Most papers got rid of their religion beat a long time ago. @bryanmealer was talking about this last night at his Book signing. (Excellent Book about god, oil, life)
277 2018-02-08 23:28:13 You can focus on this or that, but whether a lesson is helpful, hurtful, or inane is not certain.
People frequently mistake the cyclical for the secular and vice versa. If you thought the rise in oil prices was secular in 2007 the rest of your "knowledge" was harmful, period.
278 2018-02-08 23:28:07 You Dems are against off shore drilling. On shore drilling. The pipeline and fracking. So I guess you want the U.S.A. to be solely dependent on foreign oil.

281 2018-02-08 23:27:59 Can u use nyx oil blotting sheets as rolling papers
282 2018-02-08 23:27:59 Technicaly nowhere right now, sure. But picking the most extreme examples doesnt help anyhow. And actually Oil+Gas are products for the masses. ;)
283 2018-02-08 23:27:54 If I don't get home too late i'll stream it. If I can't then i'll do it tomorrow since I probably still wont have oil and can't play rl. mic or nah?
284 2018-02-08 23:27:50 Great thing your doing Darnell. I've been an Oilers fan from day 1 and saw 4 Stanley cups won at the Colliseum, lots of great memories. I really hope you can experience it one day!!
285 2018-02-08 23:27:38 Alberta is basically our Texas, so some of the opinions about our interfering in their getting their oil to market are a little more strongly expressed.
286 2018-02-08 23:27:31 Except for the fact perceived value is based on oil. If it were Chavez (invoking his spirit) he would acknowledge that we have passed out of the carbon based economy. He is probably spooking Elon Musk right now :-)
287 2018-02-08 23:27:29 Changed my brand of bread to a brand that does not contain palm oil. Too little too late but I am trying
288 2018-02-08 23:27:27 remember to oil down those suckers LOL
289 2018-02-08 23:27:25 zinc niacinamide serum from the ordinary, tea trea oil and acne cream, aloe vera straight from the plant, and witch hazel toner. also diet has a a huugge role to play in it and figuring out it was due to hormones!
290 2018-02-08 23:27:23 Since I'm now on day 7 of being sick, I'm giving tea tree oil a go in my diffuser in hopes that it'll kill the gunk in the air.
291 2018-02-08 23:27:13 Yup or tea tree oil if you have it
292 2018-02-08 23:27:07 Me too.... that‚Äôs why I moved to Vancouver island... bulbs are popping and green grass... just a thought... you can still watch the oil from here
293 2018-02-08 23:27:04 Well would Quebec show some solidarity for Alberta and buy up all our oil!!  Thanks ! Much appreciated 
294 2018-02-08 23:26:59 I think I put too much peppermint oil on my scalp, my shit is wild tingly right now

302 2018-02-08 23:25:57 Amid all the obstacles, any negotiation and dialogue in Venezuela has no chance if Tillerson in background threatening oil sanctions.
303 2018-02-08 23:25:52 @lushcosmetics Thank You, for creating the most amazing bath Bombs and oil bars to be the perfect end to not so great days. The perfect steamy bath, and a chilled Riesling, wipes away a bad day. #Lush #bathbombs #twighlight #dreamtime
304 2018-02-08 23:25:52 I swear I wanna be an oil girl 
305 2018-02-08 23:25:38 What's in the waters is a resource and that is BC',s anything messes that up is our business. Like if the Feds took your oil. If you were so sure Kelly wouldn't fight so hard to alter consensus reality.
306 2018-02-08 23:25:31 Will fight it tooth nail. Also, he has a golf course here too...I can nearly throw a rock at, so we shall see. Ultimately, all this oil, drilling, mining is what ties back to Russia...When we fight for our oceans, we fight the whole Trump/Russia conflagration...
307 2018-02-08 23:25:27 Because Mike not every place can run their economy on the basis of rooftops covered in plants and solar panels. Some economies depend on oil and pipelines to run their economy and to create jobs. Should France or B.C. dictate to them? A larger perspective please.

309 2018-02-08 23:25:16 Florida must demand that Gov Rick Scott get agreement in writing (with Trump) that states that no new offshore drilling for oil will be permissible.  Scott plans to campaign for Bill Nelson's Senate seat, and I don't trust Trump to honor his end of the bargain should Scott lose.
310 2018-02-08 23:25:15 NuStar(NS) crashed today and I just found out PBF is another Bill Greehey venture.  He's a bit of a celeb in this part of the word(oil gas).  They both pay dividends but not a lot.
311 2018-02-08 23:24:59 I don't understand how competitors always make the same mistakes on Chopped:
1. Don't give @conantnyc raw red onions
2. Don't use sesame or *gasp* truffle oil
3. Don't make a panna cotta
4. Your bread pudding absolutely will not cook all the way through
312 2018-02-08 23:24:37 green policies e.g. palm oil as biofuel, burning wood in power stations reduce habitat. Human health has improved immeasurably in past 40 years. Particulates different issue than climate change. Particulate levels have declined dramatically over past 50 years in west.
313 2018-02-08 23:24:34 1 @SecretaryZinke is planning on opening up millions of California desert acres to mining. Again, #Zinke is kowtowing to the mining/oil/gas industries without doing the basic legal environmental requirements.

317 2018-02-08 23:23:09 I put truffle oil on everything to make it instantly bougie
318 2018-02-08 23:23:06 trying to decide on whether I should take my hair out tonight or tomorrow night... I need a good deep conditioning and hot oil treatment
319 2018-02-08 23:23:02 I agree with you. Why didn‚Äôt greenpeace mention any of the initiatives the oil sands company and the govt were doing to protect the environment? I totally think both videos are bias #suncor #Greenpeace
320 2018-02-08 23:23:00 You're short on imagination & long on anger. Calling others fascist nazis while declaring THEY can take care of the mess from the oil that YOU want? You don't have to be a(n effing) millionaire to live on the coast,but everyone's well being is impacted by the health of the ocean.
321 2018-02-08 23:23:00 Sorry my long view vision is getting kind of blurry from all that pot smoke in Alberta. What an amazing transition,  from crude oil to THC oil.
322 2018-02-08 23:22:41 Iran's work. They are trying to push the envelope. Only way Russia gets access to the oil is via US/SDF agreement.

326 2018-02-08 23:22:20 ¬´In tombs of gold and lapis lazuli
bodies of holy men and women exude

lie bodies of the vampires full of blood;
their shrouds are bloody and their lips are wet.¬ª

333 2018-02-08 23:21:51 U.S. shale oil wells are labour & machine intensive, & have a relatively short lifespan.
 Prices have 2b comfortable 4 continued expenditure, & they have 2b continually prepping, this was why OPEC could slap the U.S. out of production, but we knew this ALREADY didn't we.

339 2018-02-08 23:21:15 I feel both Suncor vs. Greenpeace both do a good job at portraying their views regarding oil sands. I think we as individuals needs to look at both with a grain of salt and push for safer measures to protect the earth. Is Suncor doing enough?#suncor #oilsands #lesson5

343 2018-02-08 23:20:48 We need to refine our oil and retail to the world!
344 2018-02-08 23:20:46 Money is not a factor. Our health, our children, grand kids & the lives of our animal kingdom are more important than the risk of oil spills damaging our water&land. The loss of lives are not worth the risk to have this happen to anyone. Consequences are real.

382 2018-02-08 23:15:52 Cold water. Don‚Äôt put any kind of oil on it like coconut oil. It traps in the heat and makes it hurt worse. Learned that the hard way.
383 2018-02-08 23:15:30 Did any of your parents in the 00s go through a phase where they bought exclusively Meleluca Oil products or was that just mine?
384 2018-02-08 23:15:25 @Shopbodyorganic I am your first follower! I deserve a huge discount on your organic body oil. I hope you're still at Area 11 though?
385 2018-02-08 23:15:24 the top one works really well for something like gallons of oil released in major oil spills, for each oil company
386 2018-02-08 23:15:23 Yes again in the hospital. Hit oil or ice on a RAB. Waiting to see if my right shoulder or rib broken.  The damn pain 
387 2018-02-08 23:14:50 Leave in conditioner for when it‚Äôs wet and then some sort of Oil (just for the ends) once it‚Äôs dry. Sleeping in braids too!

389 2018-02-08 23:14:41 Aren't you? I am. 
It isn't the "cost" of anything as the economy is still predicted to grow substantially.
I repeat, the $20 increase in the price of oil is predicted to have a similar effect.
390 2018-02-08 23:14:37 @realDonaldTrump Pull but one string from the current tangle of today‚Äôs multiple foreign policy crises, and odds are it will lead back to something Kissinger did between 1968 and 1977. Over-reliance on Saudi oil? That‚Äôs Kissinger.

393 2018-02-08 23:13:40 It would help if the AER did it's job but the PCs allowed it to function without any duty to the public interest. The PCs set up REDA for immunity. The Redwater decision ensures the taxpayers will pay for the liabilities of bankrupt oil comp. Think tailings ponds, orphan wells.
394 2018-02-08 23:13:30 Oil and gas we already got, thanks! And, so you know, we get our gasoline from the States. Very little west coast fuel comes from AB. Might be due to lack of refineries. KM sludge is for export. So, if you want to shoot yourself in the foot, be our guests!
395 2018-02-08 23:13:29 I dropped my car off at like 9:30 at the latest this morning for an oil change and I still haven‚Äôt got called yet... sooooo I better be picking up a brand new car.

398 2018-02-08 23:13:16 he green-lighted a pipeline, how is that attacking the energy sector, plus I think there are incentives for solar, wind and geothermal, or is it just the oil and gas sector of the energy sector you are concerned about?

403 2018-02-08 23:13:07 The government needs to put every possible road block in place of oil and gas development, or else they are not doing the job no one actually voted on them to do. Elections have consequences, right Mikey. Heard that one somewhere before.

406 2018-02-08 23:12:40 Barrier cream, any one of a dozen hand cleaners, soap and water and then hand cream to put the moisture back. Baby wipes are also immense at cleaning off grease and oil.
407 2018-02-08 23:12:38 I'm pretty sure they would still be around. If college athletes have been screwed as much as you say they wouldn't need to play college sports.......because they all would've struck oil.
408 2018-02-08 23:12:28 Your  average 30 year old is not investing in gold or oil but rather tech and token.
409 2018-02-08 23:12:25 These cities and county that brought these absurd lawsuits should be denied gas and oil. Let their cars sit in the garage. Then they would think twice about biting the hand that feeds them.

413 2018-02-08 23:11:47 For now, we may be selling a lot of products to them.  I think our oil is a bit challenging for them but if they can refine it, we‚Äôll have plenty.

415 2018-02-08 23:11:35 You are at it again your thoughts are worthless given when a federal MP you SIR did nothing for Canada‚Äôs top oil companies/industry...from 2006 2015 CPC‚Äôs were a disaster for Alberta for 10 years & your provincial counter parts spent spent spent every $ Why are you different now
416 2018-02-08 23:11:33 Maybe just start a war with them and take their oil. Why change protocol?

419 2018-02-08 23:11:16 Recently, evangelical extremists allowed oil drilling in an undisclosed number of annoyed black voters, but you were too distracted by Trump's tweets to notice.

421 2018-02-08 23:11:03 Hi there. Which oil specifically did you purchase for your sleep? Definitely plan to try but want to buy the right one.
422 2018-02-08 23:10:48 Will do. Thanks for standing up for Canada.  I hope it doesn‚Äôt get too cold and dark when our oil and gas is turned off.  You wouldn‚Äôt want that dirty stuff.
423 2018-02-08 23:10:47 Seriously, the worst part about my new skincare hobby is when I try a sample of something pricey and IT ACTUALLY WORKS. I (and my bank account) really just want luxury items to be snake oil, dammit!
424 2018-02-08 23:10:37 You took Our guns away made it hard to buy ammunition impose a crippling gas tax I hope Trump puts a beautiful oil rig in front of every coastal home in California a paints the sands black with your liberal tears.

428 2018-02-08 23:10:06 That is conjecture , in my opinion. Why would Putin want to ‚Äú help‚Äú Trump get elected ? Trump wanted to build our military & increase energy independence, thus peripherally hurting Russia‚Äôs oil export economy.
429 2018-02-08 23:10:03 Y is bc attacking poor oil workers?
430 2018-02-08 23:09:58 i am! and butter, in moderation. i can't eat margarine, b/c most brands have soy oil.
if i could afford the higher priced, mire efficiently acting medicine i wouldn't have to have these restrictions :((
431 2018-02-08 23:09:43 President Trump is helping AMERICANS take over the global oil market.

Oil is how Putin gets his money & power.

Take that away and he has nothing.

That is much more effective than silly sanctions.  

You will see.  It's checkers vs chess.
432 2018-02-08 23:09:18 Someone call me when more women are working at oil rigs than men.

438 2018-02-08 23:08:38 Have you tried garlic oil? It's easy to make. A couple of drops in the ear can help with the pain

440 2018-02-08 23:08:33 Little bit of olive oil, finely chopped onion, fresh tomato finely chopped, garam masala, a little salt.

Fry onion until soft.
Add tomato, garam masala and salt.
Wait till it forms a sauce.
Add okra, washed and patted dry, cut into inch long pieces. 
I like it crisp not too soft

613 2018-02-08 22:47:12 Just trying to compete, but ethanol gave up their "subsidy". Again, it was for blenders, not producers. Tariff was to counter blender credit. Somehow oil has managed to maintain their billions in subsidies though, now over 105 years worth.

616 2018-02-08 22:47:00 Off shore drilling would produce oil that would lower sky high prices in CA and state fuel tax revenue. But why would you want that? Your greed and lack of concern for CA is boundless. @RepSwalwell @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson @GOPChairwoman @marthamaccallum

633 2018-02-08 22:44:59 When my hair was super damaged I used to mix saffron & cinnamon together massage it into the roots it opens the follicles & make a avocado/mayo/olive oil/lemon zest mask & do those & it really does but castor oil is thick so you mix it with water and it hydrates tf out your hair
634 2018-02-08 22:44:59 hhhhmmmmm... #Oil
635 2018-02-08 22:44:46 The support for solar industry which the UK government removed was not ‚Äúsubsidy‚Äù any more than the eye-watering tax breaks given to oil industry which resulted in UK being the only government ever to have to PAY oil companies to produce oil when every other country was making ¬£¬£¬£
636 2018-02-08 22:44:41 Yes...now imagine the east sayin they built the whole country. ..whether in the east west or north. You will find out every penny used came from different products. Until oil came along...and then the problem started.
637 2018-02-08 22:44:18 Plant? Really? A vast majority of this stuff contains milk or egg if not the flesh itself of fish oil. If I had time I'd colour each brands out to show you how naive it is to think animal is not dominant here.
638 2018-02-08 22:44:14 ahhh what ive heard is that ur scalp produces more oil when its dry/stripped of essential oils.. so i think.. even tho it seems backwards.. it might actually work. idk thats just based on what ive heard before
639 2018-02-08 22:44:09 Oil not only pollutes Canada it divides it as well
640 2018-02-08 22:44:08 ANHA didn't talk about the US strike against the SAA at all, did the US and Deir Ezzor Military Council foil a YPG-SAA agreement to hand over oil fields for support to Afrin ?
641 2018-02-08 22:44:01 "When it comes to investment attractiveness in the oil and gas sector, I would certainly consider Mexico to be in the top tier." - Iv√°n Sandrea, CEO of @SierraOil
642 2018-02-08 22:44:01 But, you've missed a critical part of the (likely) charade... it was all about distracting from the DNC emails during the primaries (wasn't it?), Drumpf just got yanked in to help legitimise their snake oil (IIRC).
643 2018-02-08 22:43:53 Yes and Labour will continue to do so.  They can't afford to lose the revenue or the oil.

649 2018-02-08 22:43:03 @cathmckenna Fact: You have no idea how much damage an oil tanker full of heavy Bitumen sinking off BC's coast will cause, or how effective your cleanup measures will be. BC will never accept a 7 fold increase in tanker traffic
650 2018-02-08 22:43:01 Black seed oil is my holy grail
651 2018-02-08 22:42:59 The only role US had in creating ISIS was to leave Iraq early opening a place for ISIS to grow. When in Iraq, we could've required payment or taken ownership of the oil wells. We purposely chose not to. We don't use ISIS as a proxy. We fight them and they have attacked us.

659 2018-02-08 22:42:03 The whole country was shocked by the oil spill off Santa Barbara. A few years later, it was the Exxon Valdez off Alaska.  The pictures from those incidents are branded into my memory.  Never again! @realDonaldTrump
660 2018-02-08 22:42:02 @RachelNotley We would like to thank you for standing up to John Horgan in regards to his decision on the Kinder Morgan Pipeline.

662 2018-02-08 22:41:54 I have no idea whether that person is a part of snake oil fakery or an authentic witness to God's power, but I'd rather over-credit God (if even possible), than under-praise Him.
663 2018-02-08 22:41:45 You're both correct however if we leave, Russian makes exclusive oil deal with all middle eastern countries.

While I agree us getting in was wrong, us getting right out has problems too.

I don't have an better idea, I just wish we never went into Iraq to begin with....

694 2018-02-08 22:37:37 The USA has a finite amount of natural resources : fresh water, farmable land, oil, etc. The more persons allowed to immigrate into the USA, the fewer natural resources there will be for each American, and the poorer the average American will be.

727 2018-02-08 22:33:00 I'm so serious about the hello fresh code... You'll get 40 dollars off your box. It comes with everything you'll need to cook with besides oil and the utensils but other than that you'll have a remotely healthy meal and it's cheap!
728 2018-02-08 22:32:45 people who only use coconut oil to take their makeup off are fucking scary

742 2018-02-08 22:31:43 HEY! Why no notice of the ONE public hearing about offshore oil drilling to be held in Sacramento? This is absurd. Do you really think ANY state wants oil rigs off their coast? How much are the oil companies paying you? You are committing a criminal act against the people of CA.
743 2018-02-08 22:31:34 Anybody know how many miles your car can be overdue for an oil change before it blows up

745 2018-02-08 22:31:25 I should block you for calling me ma'am. 
I meant simply how the money was distributed to states, which was the question you asked. HAVA wasn't the problem, the problem was states listening to vendor snake oil claims and discounting security researchers
746 2018-02-08 22:31:23 Sometimes I stream my gym maintenance routines. I make sexually suggestive jokes throughout because I literally oil holes and lube shafts.

757 2018-02-08 22:30:33 1. We were not exporting crops only
2. Most exported crop was the highest revenue earner?
3. Research how the colonial masters used excesses from the south to balance deficits in the north
4. Do another research on revenues gotten from from all exports before the coming of oil...
758 2018-02-08 22:30:32 Hasn't been subsidized for years, and that was a blender's credit (VEETC) that went to those that blended ethanol and gasoline, not producers or farmers. Typically those are oil companies, fuel suppliers or retailers.

781 2018-02-08 22:28:48 Middle East oil was declared a resource of national interest to the US just after WW2.
American interests were determined back then to control it.

We value clean coastlines and your constitutional rights.
793 2018-02-08 22:27:42 Thank you!!  1. Do not wash your hair everyday. That creates breakage. Use a cotton shirt or air dry your hair, less breakage and frizz. 2. Coconut oil, Shea Moisture products, and Coconut Miracle Oil products is your best friend. 3. Learn about twist outs that best suit you.

795 2018-02-08 22:27:27 That's funny coming from the man who orchestrated the 9-11 attacks and then tried to blame it on a particular religion. And this was done just because he knew the American people would not be willing to go to war for his greed of money and oil

819 2018-02-08 22:25:17 Saw article on OK's proposed wind tax. Wind farms already pay property tax that oil/gas companies don't pay. I'd say govt - especially local govts - much better off collecting property tax than a special tax on elec generation.

822 2018-02-08 22:24:40 Rachel Notley was never much for pipelines when she was in opposition or even the oil sands. She attended protests against them.
823 2018-02-08 22:24:23 Perhaps, if New Brunswick brought in ALL of the taxes it was supposed to bring in, instead of pandering to tax-dodging elitists we might actually be able to create jobs rather than having our legislation written by oligarchical oil barons. It's their province, we just die here.
824 2018-02-08 22:24:15 note how she's careful to say "energy products", not oil. 
Because it ain't oil. It's dilbit. Horrible stuff that will sink during a spill and no technology exists to clean it up.

839 2018-02-08 22:22:19 Probably because there are far too many countries there hungry for the OIL!   And anything else that might be valuable! Chaos!

842 2018-02-08 22:21:47 The USA has a finite amount of natural resources : fresh water, farmable land, oil, etc. The more persons allowed to immigrate into the USA, the fewer natural resources there will be for each American, and the poorer the average American will be.

848 2018-02-08 22:21:14 A tough stance against oil pipelines is a tough stance for our health and future. Tar sands offer short gains for our future as a species.
849 2018-02-08 22:21:07 Greens are foreigner supremacists & Oz traitors.
They support
1. UN ahead of Oz law
2. Open borders, cheering foreigner litigation against Oz OP
3. Shutting down coal/gas/oil; driving jobs/royalties/profits, OS
4. Demonize & bankrupt Oz military making us an easy target.

850 2018-02-08 22:21:05 Thanks! I‚Äôll put some coconut oil on just now! I used daddy-o to wash my hair, what do you use?? It‚Äôs meant for blondes but I love the smell so much 
851 2018-02-08 22:21:01 amerika wants to reach oil by supporting terror for many years
852 2018-02-08 22:21:00 Thats pretty shocking actually. I thought all that palm nut oil could make shit quite slippery. You know who aren't vanilla, east africans. Ain't no tanzanian women trying to cook to key to any mans heart
853 2018-02-08 22:20:57 A woman gave me the finger today when I mentioned that some women can't change their own oil, tires, etc. but still preach about equality.. Equality is only mentioned when there's potential for a personal gain..
854 2018-02-08 22:20:44 Because Abu Dhabi Govt make money from oil, Our Govt make money from speeding fines...
855 2018-02-08 22:20:42 I need this type of jazz in my life. Cee-C is definitely using oil
856 2018-02-08 22:20:39 coconut oil saved my life
857 2018-02-08 22:20:31 Today my husband came home with a  fresh coconut & he got a google express delivery with organic coconut oil.. he knows my heart #theLittleThings
858 2018-02-08 22:20:13 i have a straight perm on my naturally curly hair but it‚Äôs bleached so it gets tangly super easy, can confirm deep masks are the bestttt! I use Eva nyc therapy session as a normal conditioner along with Giovanni olive oil + avocado conditioner & Marc Anthony macadamia nut
859 2018-02-08 22:20:06 The high price of crude oil won't be sustained in future. But that will depend on how many people will be charging their cars.
860 2018-02-08 22:20:02 Because he's pretending that he's nailing the gold short when he actually started shorting it 60-70 bucks ago? Also underwater on oil.
861 2018-02-08 22:19:52 I am old enough to remember when you came home from the beach with oil tar on the bottom of your feet.  We don't want to go back to that crap. @RepMimiWalters doesn't represent #ca45 and would allow the drilling.

868 2018-02-08 22:19:04 Well~ good for Ca. As an Oil& Gas employee of 17yrs, there has to be risk vs. benefit to drive decisions. Their oil is from North Slope & Canada. Issue is limited refining capacity. 
For all you criticizing: Bash Florida!
869 2018-02-08 22:18:59 The USA has a finite amount of natural resources : fresh water, farmable land, oil, etc. The more persons allowed to immigrate into the USA, the fewer natural resources there will be for each American, and the poorer the average American will be.

874 2018-02-08 22:18:37 IF #WTI $ action is DOW based, not oil fundamentals, will it spring right back, once things settle?  Probably not, based upon seasonal stock builds keeping a lid on optimism.  Bigger question, will $ volatility impact shale prod going forward, spooking debt lenders & E&P's? #OOTT
875 2018-02-08 22:18:30 You‚Äôre literally allergic to peanut oil, so you shouldn‚Äôt be having Chick Fil A in the first place
876 2018-02-08 22:18:23 85% of America's global economy is powered by oil & coal. Our #RFID tags are made to handle the harsh conditions of these fields.
877 2018-02-08 22:18:20 My whole house smells like oil now 
878 2018-02-08 22:18:15 There is no way Oil Cos should or will be prosecuted for fraud under your &Sheldons fraud theory .  It was laughed out of Washington in 2014. As far as being an expert on climate change causes & fixes i guess you believe someone has those answers. Possibly @SenWhitehouse
879 2018-02-08 22:18:12 Use coconut oil they grow faster
880 2018-02-08 22:18:08 Sears is the worst store ever. 2 hours for an oil change I feel like beating the fuck out of this guy
881 2018-02-08 22:18:07 As long as the market and private property take precedence there will be war.. anything but socialism is a sticking plaster. They fight for oil so they can refuel and fight for more.
882 2018-02-08 22:18:01 A woman at work told me she massages almond oil over her entire body each morning. That'd be a full time job for me.
883 2018-02-08 22:17:59 I tried oil pulling once and I already gave up

885 2018-02-08 22:17:48 Maybe they should let them build the pipeline but then once completed, fill it with B.C. wine, reverse the direction, flood Alberta with it, and call it the Wineline #BCwine #wine #pipeline #oil #BCpoli #ABpoli #WineSpillsNotOilSpills #problemsolved
886 2018-02-08 22:17:47 Whoever‚Äôs in charge of the ZipCar service here, vehicle B10HVX exhaust pipe is dangling and clanks on the ground sometimes. Also, vehicle KJT3332 needs an oil change. Y‚Äôall might wanna check their front and rear lights just in case as well. #umes
887 2018-02-08 22:17:31 The Coastal Commission? 200 years from now it might receive it's final stamp of "Denied!" By that time oil will be Obsolete. 
888 2018-02-08 22:17:21 Just put some coconut oil on it
889 2018-02-08 22:17:11 I left $400 in my seat then gave these ppl my keys to get my oil changed , had to turn around go back they might steal 
890 2018-02-08 22:17:10 yung oil talaga ng niluluto ko yung rason kung bakit ako gising na gising every morning
891 2018-02-08 22:17:05 First of all oil change only cost the price of the oil if you do it yourself, and air filter is 40 bucks if that. So yeah it can be done big dawg
892 2018-02-08 22:17:03 We think @SpaceX & @Tesla made the wrong choice in putting a car in space . it was a waste of time and money , it wont do anything for the world accept pollute space with all of the gas and oil and molecules its made out of .

895 2018-02-08 22:16:43 Thats cause Trump is mining lithium not joking. Plus a few other metals he mining for! Just like during his presidental campaign refrencing the iraq war he commented he would take their oil supply. Shame when truths come out. Thats not how the United States of America

897 2018-02-08 22:16:30 As long as the market and private property take precedence there will be war.. anything but socialism is a sticking plaster. They fight for oil so they can refuel and fight for more.
898 2018-02-08 22:16:16 I wish I had that perspective when I was younger but then again my depression was too severe at the time but as the saying goes "Better late then never"! You'll get nothing but love from your fans "Oil Tot" let that be your focus!
899 2018-02-08 22:15:56 ooh i love sugar scrubs! maybe coconut oil would work?

I should think the recovery of oil fields held by ISIS will suffice toward revenues dedicated to this purpose.
902 2018-02-08 22:15:34 Yo I‚Äôve been a super responsible adult today. Got all my bills paid, went to school, and got an oil change. Now I‚Äôm going to sit back and enjoy some Rick and Morty

910 2018-02-08 22:14:52 There will be an economic tsunami coming from the south. The deregulation and approval of offshore Pacific Drilling could prove to be fatal to Canada's oil industry. Investors will go home

911 2018-02-08 22:14:41 An economist in the oil industry and asking that question  It doesn‚Äôt matter who the profits are for ffs, it‚Äôs profits that are taxed at source!

912 2018-02-08 22:14:41 Did anyone ever have a diffuser from young living begin to smell like hot or burnt metal? Maybe it was the oil combo?
913 2018-02-08 22:14:38 They were Russian PMCs trying to seize oil and gas fields, which they can then use to pay off Assad's grade FFF debt
914 2018-02-08 22:14:38 Rally around Canada! Rally around our future. US became the world leader in oil/gas production during Obama, the great climate ch fighter
915 2018-02-08 22:14:29 NWO W. Bush willingly swallowed false intelligence. His buddy, British Prime Minister, Tony Blair cooked up his own false dossier on Weapons of Mass Destruction. A plan to kill people and get the oil.
916 2018-02-08 22:14:24 It's not beneficial to anyone other than big oil. NDP took power and you blamed them for all your troubles not taking in to account the previous government sold you out for years.

923 2018-02-08 22:13:42 I have fine hair, but it tangles up pretty easily (dread city). I only wash 2 times a week always use a macadamia oil (I forget the brand) after each wash. Helps!
924 2018-02-08 22:13:41 Thatcher was disastrous for the economy, mass unemployment & deep recession apart from a small boom in 87 which then crashed. Callaghan said in 79, whoever wins will be in power 4 15 yrs due to oil/gas wealth on line in 1980. Squandered in destroying industry instead of investing

934 2018-02-08 22:12:58 if the least Boomers can do, they can't even do, like stopping pipelines, then all the talk is meaningless.  We have to get off the sauce.  Transport Revolutions--Moving People and Freight without Oil was written over a decade ago and we are increasingly behind

940 2018-02-08 22:12:23 We are going to protect and build pipelines and keep Russia from building one. Oil & natural gas. No surprise. Our military following orders from Commander in Chief. If you want to criticize him that's fine but consider his entire mission is secondary to the geopolitics.
941 2018-02-08 22:12:23 I‚Äôm SO glad I had that bottle of argon oil I had forgotton about; I was NOT gonna use coconut oil in my hair, it‚Äôs already thin enough.

943 2018-02-08 22:12:14 The economy of the province is a little more than one company jackass. You know how many people are supported by the oil industry in Alberta and NE BC?
944 2018-02-08 22:12:09  I wash my face with Cetaphil gentle foam cleanser, I exfoliate 3-4 times a week, I use @LOrealParisUSA Hydrafresh toner after washing my face, I moisturize with @GarnierFR 3-in-1 rose water moisturizer day and night! Sometimes I‚Äôll top it off with almond oil at night!!

947 2018-02-08 22:11:38 Oh hadn't you heard-- Pruitt is not head of EPA he's head of the destruction of the EPA. That's why he needed a scif inside his office. His deputy when asked what her job was replied "to promote oil & gas." Doubt she was suppose to say that out loud.

951 2018-02-08 22:11:09 Nationalize Oil and Gas reserves, climate action keep Hydro public, High taxes on Canada's wealthiest, Free post secondary education, keep life affordable for Canadians, more products made in Canada. No selling Canadian arms to human rights violators, Canadians are peacekeepers!
952 2018-02-08 22:10:51 You attribute it to peak oil demand? Demand numbers increased substantially, and production revised up, but still inventories drained.
953 2018-02-08 22:10:43 salty hair, coconut oil, big waves, hot sun
954 2018-02-08 22:10:40 Before I moved to Houston, I lived in La & personally lived the Deepwater Horizon spill. 11 souls were lost that night. Oil spilled was cleaned up for years.

983 2018-02-08 22:07:01 You're "on the wrong side of history" as they say.  And you know it. A shame you're such a shill for big oil. 
Sending love. Sorry for your loss.

985 2018-02-08 22:06:37 Great! Now @dunkindonuts can end all use of #palm oil that is destroying forest habitat and wiping out animals. URGENT!!!
986 2018-02-08 22:06:37 @cathmckenna @JustinTrudeau @gmbutts unless it‚Äôs overpriced and only a liberal ideal it will not be built especially that dirty oil it‚Äôs much better getting it from Saudi and Iran
987 2018-02-08 22:06:21 That arousal oil looks really great! Unfortunately, we do not carry it.
988 2018-02-08 22:06:20 Man even went as far as saying they used groundnut money to build  oil refineries.
989 2018-02-08 22:06:17 I finally got one of those essential oil diffusers and am testing it with an oil called "calm." 

I ACTUALLY FEEL SO CALM.
990 2018-02-08 22:06:08 58.50 to 60 is the monthly bo range in CRUDE OIL.
991 2018-02-08 22:06:04 Give me a break!! We can more than support  all of the country with the existing rigs in Gulf, wells in La., Tx., Ok, not including the Canadian oil we are now receiving via pipeline. 
We have begun exporting off east coast. As nation we must balance risk vs reward.

993 2018-02-08 22:05:35 Yes, but that industry is odd. There was a social network just for oil and gas company peeps that failed. And they think their audiences are not on social (so so so wrong, just search oil and gas in Pinterst to see how wrong).  So old fashioned.
994 2018-02-08 22:05:13 Tar sands release 3x the greenhouse gasses as regular oil extraction, so is it worth it? Former NASA climate scientist James Hansen believes this type of energy extraction would be "game over" for the climate  #Lesson5 #Peertopeer #phys273 #Politics
995 2018-02-08 22:05:12 My question exactly... oh, and why did @SenWhitehouse co-sponsor the bill to expand tax credits for CO2-enhanced oil drilling that's now a part of the budget bill??

1012 2018-02-08 22:03:55 Tell the truth Dianne. There are large oil reserves off the coast of central California near the homes of your elite pals who finance your campaigns. Without their cash you can't get voted into office.
1013 2018-02-08 22:03:50 Happened to me last August. Took my service truck in for maintenance, spotted a 2500 HD extended cab on the lot.  Needless to say, that was an expensive oil change. Actually get to drive it about once a month.

1018 2018-02-08 22:03:30 True and that's sad but the virulent anti-Alberta oil stance of the BC government hurts a lot of small businesses and regular people and families too. Our geologist neighbour is driving a school bus now. I have boycotted BC wines for a while. #ableg

1020 2018-02-08 22:03:22 Much of the demand for our oil is from the US. We send them an average of 2.6 million barrels a day a few years ago #peertopeer #Lesson5 #PHYS273

1030 2018-02-08 22:02:24 Tragic, but that is what you get when one finger has an oil stain. If it is not washed off immediately, the rest of the fingers could get stained too. Selah!
1031 2018-02-08 22:02:24 It‚Äôs also a dirt cheap dinner! The other one that goes a long way is butternut squash roasted (takes about 20/30 mins in the oven) and then some grains like bulga wheat, green veg and some olive oil is nice.

1044 2018-02-08 22:01:14 @andrewcbc I'm pissed at the amount of time you gave the oil patch guy who said solar / renewables are 'unproven'.  What crap!  Why didn't you also interview an environmentalist that understands the issue.  Man-made Climate Change is THE greatest environmental threat facing us.

1059 2018-02-08 22:00:20 Circlips can become rusted into the knuckle. Removal of this part can cause over-stressing to the clip or even breakage. 
To prevent this from happening, penetrating oil can be used during removal to help free the rust build-up between the knuckle groove and circlip.

1061 2018-02-08 22:00:19 It's not especially different from the rest. The oil doesn't necessarily add to anything. It really doesn't have any "onion flavour". So practically useless and juiceless.

1098 2018-02-08 21:54:18 The Italians call it ‚ÄòAgromafia‚Äô and it‚Äôs estimated to be a $16-billion-per-year enterprise. One result: Much of the olive oil we import isn‚Äôt as pure as it seems.

1103 2018-02-08 21:53:47 Italy‚Äôs olive oil business has been corrupted by the Mafia, which is making big bucks tampering with Italian food products in ways that could affect American consumers.
1104 2018-02-08 21:53:44 Oregon, Washington, & California are all about clean energy & all have beautiful coastlines. Drilling for oil on West Coast is dangerous & unnecessary. We need to consume less oil, not spoil our own nest.

1115 2018-02-08 21:52:48 Google is my friend. In the US, it seems oil was mixed with fine gravel and rolled as a cheap road surface.

1118 2018-02-08 21:52:31 I don‚Äôt disagree. All of the above are advantages of using biomass over oil, but it‚Äôs nonsensical to also reward any publicly funded organisation with more public funds proportional to the amount of renewable heat generated, other than to cover the initial capital investment.

1123 2018-02-08 21:51:55 Interesting numbers: IF Starman's Tesla had a petrol engine, and if you needed to change its oil every 10k km, you'd need to change it every 47 minutes or so.

That would mean it's made from super-ethical and environmentally-friendly oil, of course...
1135 2018-02-08 21:49:23 And I'll add I would have no problem if we get a new fractal cycle somewhere in the 50s that goes back to 60. We will make money on that way up, AND we'll have more to short on the way down again. The narrative pushers can't win. Their false rise is now their doom :)

1236 2018-02-08 21:36:14 No oil light to speak of please clarify lol
1237 2018-02-08 21:36:12 The key question to ask is why the Dwight Ball Government, NOIA, CAPP and the offshore oil industry are fighting so hard to give the CNLOPB all the power over environmental assessments...
1238 2018-02-08 21:36:09 Groundnut at the time was the biggest cash crop in 'northern Nigeria' only. As a country cocoa, palm oil, and rubber were the most valuable  and exported at the time along with groundnut
1239 2018-02-08 21:36:02 Yes and tbh Mark most of this money comes from #Scottish #oil.how the hell dyo think WE feel, not given a decent % of that for the birth mother of the economy ?
1240 2018-02-08 21:35:59 Am no oil painting myself but no she's not pretty
1241 2018-02-08 21:35:57 My cars engine light is off. Plus when it comes on it just wants a oil change 2000 miles before it actually needs it
1242 2018-02-08 21:35:54 Jose is honestly a blessing  he fixed my whole car ignition and did an oil change & cleaned my van for me...and he also bought me a coffee & Fabian a happy meal  #blessed
1243 2018-02-08 21:35:53 Already gotcha MAGA!
1244 2018-02-08 21:35:49 We could just refine the oil in AB and ship finished product? Is it just a bad idea cause Elizabeth May says it?
1245 2018-02-08 21:35:47 Please collect that energy and focus it towards the oil industry. Twitter is not to blame for other people being stupid

But some lotion and johnson's baby oil gel got them right back to beautiful in a day!   lol   Like they were dry and just dying!  lol
1251 2018-02-08 21:35:07 Love this - confirms two of my fave pre-workout items; oatmeal w/ rasp/blueberries and coconut oil plus dates with raw organic almond butter! Occasionally two eggs with spinach or other greens!
1252 2018-02-08 21:34:53 But again NASA has been totally defunded so government funding on space programs (not to mention electric cars/solar panels) is long overdue

The govt should really be pouring a whole lot more into renewable technology research and stop giving oil companies subsidies
1253 2018-02-08 21:34:50 Ha back to oil?

1257 2018-02-08 21:34:20 There‚Äôs no better feeling than coming home after a long day at work and soaking your achy body in a nice hot Epsom salt, baby oil bath.. Yasss! Relaxation at its finest 
1258 2018-02-08 21:34:20 Of course I hope you're correct @RhoRho69, but #oil rose from roughly $30 to $65 in last year so ... my point is #SPR's a tactical (not strategic) reserve/tool, so be smart about its use in the market (you know, like the producer countries/#OPEC try to be & often are). #OOTT

1265 2018-02-08 21:33:46 #NTOG repositioned the portfolio so assets makes money below $30 oil. Permian has a great ROI @ $40 oil. Anything above that is gravy! 

Of course we'll update on production and such.
1266 2018-02-08 21:33:40 70% of oil is drilled onshore because drilling in the middle of the ocean is too expensive. No kidding! #Lesson5 #PHYS273
1267 2018-02-08 21:33:38 Then add emissions from volcanoes, methane burps from the ocean floor, squirrel farts, biomatter decaying, and so on, and you realize that Al Gore has sold a lot of snake oil.
1268 2018-02-08 21:33:26 I am more concerned that SLS comes from palm oil and that there are still problems throughout the world with the deforestation of tropical forests to plant the trees.

1272 2018-02-08 21:32:49 At today‚Äôs oil prices, this safety-net firesale would raise $6 billion -- the same amount Exxon just received as a windfall from Trump's #taxscam! Maybe we should get the money back from them instead.
1273 2018-02-08 21:32:45 Amazing how those predicting a glut of production, because of high price, are not suddenly calling the price drop as a reason for cutting production.   One would think, if they believed in their thesis, they would be going long oil, right? #confirmationbias #echochamber #OOTT
1274 2018-02-08 21:32:42 Yeah shampoos take the protective oils off that are protecting your hair then your body has to make oils to protect your hair again. If anything you should be adding oil to your hair not taking it away

1280 2018-02-08 21:31:42 At the time I was going through training to become a junior investment banker *in biotech*.  I thought at the end of training I was going to have to move to Houston and switch to oil and gas banking.
1281 2018-02-08 21:31:27 Maybe they can get their oil and gas from Venezuela instead of US sources.

1286 2018-02-08 21:30:57 Check the ingredients. Depending on the base of your primer and foundation, they may not mesh right. Like water vs. oil based. They can sometimes break down one another!

1299 2018-02-08 21:29:03 Ontario would love your oil. if sockboy would be more like @realDonaldTrump and stop drowning all the companies in paperwork, permits and feasibility studies that drag on for decades, we would buy it all!

1306 2018-02-08 21:28:16 Studies don‚Äôt clean oil spills. Equipment, man power, training and the ability to move fast to clean up a spill is what we need. And heavy fines. My opinion is, once those are guaranteed, and paid for, then let the oil flow.

1317 2018-02-08 21:27:18 Focus on making oil drilling safer. All those women driving Benz and with LV purses want their men to stay safe and keep those oilfield jobs.

1319 2018-02-08 21:27:16 @countyofsb Better to work on fire/flood/mudslide prevention that do far more damage, including human & animal killings, than the better controlled, managed, and recovery operations of our needed oil drilling. 1st things 1st. Ok?
1320 2018-02-08 21:27:09 If he's trying to help people, why can't he cite a single medical study that proves his approach to treatment is consistently effective at relieving Gender Dysphoria?

1368 2018-02-08 21:22:27 This same groundnut money built the oil blocks and drills even the refineries...and also laid the pipes ... the north was never selfish.
1369 2018-02-08 21:22:22 California says will block crude oil from Trump offshore drilling plan...>Maybe we could block gas from coming in the other way! Let it dry up!
1370 2018-02-08 21:22:18 Let‚Äôs transform big oil into big renewable energies. Drill for wind power not for oil! Thank you for reporting this and organizing the planet to action. Many blessings!
1371 2018-02-08 21:22:04 They need the oil, killing of muslims is just an added bonus and a funsport.
1372 2018-02-08 21:21:41 It's also worth noting that Soberman joked quite openly that he had sold Scarborough on that crappy RT system in the first place. There was a clear implication of the country rubes and the snake oil salesman.

1379 2018-02-08 21:20:49 There were 10,000 recorded illegal taps into the Mexican oil pipelines this past year. That‚Äôs over a 50% increase compared to the year before that! And those were only the ones discovered. There‚Äôs so many wrong things about this, it‚Äôs crazy!
1380 2018-02-08 21:20:36 A lot of the post election growth was shifting of investment from industries that benefited under dems (ex renewable energy) to GOP induaties  (private corrections oil and gas etc) not real growth since none of these companies are actually investing in expanding

1384 2018-02-08 21:20:08 I apologize for the name calling. But to the facts cocoa was nt even generating enough for western region. The north still had to chip in for the west and east as palm oil could nt cut it.... "pyramids" of "bags" of groundnut.

1390 2018-02-08 21:18:55 #Biofuels are neither viable nor sustainable.
Essentially these crop based "energy sources" are subsidies for big oil and destructive agriculture. Modern crops use 15 calories of energy to produce 1 calorie of food energy. 
#Unsustainble
1391 2018-02-08 21:18:45 And the US is buying our oil at half price so they can export theirs at full value. It‚Äôs effectively killing the Canadian energy industry and this will slowly kill our social infrastructure and the teachers/nurses/doctors jobs associated with our support systems!

1393 2018-02-08 21:18:20 Obama is boiling in his own oil
1394 2018-02-08 21:18:14 And a big percentage being shipped from Texas is Canadian oil, fetching world price while we sell at a discount. The Alberta energy industry is the new home flipping scheme for the US. Let's get those pipeline built to keep our revenues.
1395 2018-02-08 21:18:00 Yeah this weather has been SAPPING the moisture from my face.. . Do u have any reccs for brands/oil type?
1396 2018-02-08 21:17:48 California is a shit hole due to you and your liberal lack of ideas. The oil spill had nothing to do with your crappie state.
1397 2018-02-08 21:17:41 Not only are they saving me a wasted oil change, but also $600+ by not making me go to a dealership.  What incredible service providers.
1398 2018-02-08 21:17:24 Why would we want to help the Russian Government sell $800B worth of oil unless we set the selling price per barrel to govern their income.

1403 2018-02-08 21:17:10 The long answer is that this will take decades. Aside from the independent agency idea, the fact is the Iraqi govt has about $5bn in oil money coming in each month now. How many countries have that? It gets sucked up by public sector comp & corruption. Just about all of it.

1408 2018-02-08 21:16:38 Thats ok we will still b paying over 2.50 a gallon in gas even though in the past when oil was around 60$ barrel we were paying around 1.50 a gallon or lower. Cause the consumer always takes it in the ass. No matter the trading price or production levels

1421 2018-02-08 21:14:56 I think it is a little misleading to lump helping the poor pay for heating as propping up the oil industry. I get your point, but I doubt that's what most would consider subsidies for the industry
1422 2018-02-08 21:14:36 the diet talk all over my office is putting me in a state of rage. i want to go pour oil and sugar all over the place in protest.
1423 2018-02-08 21:14:30 when I was stupid I thought we could sell ourselves oil cheaper than we sell to the world, you know do ourselves a fav.
Then I was educated that wall st. and futures exist to fuck every single human on the planet.
Now I'm happy.
1424 2018-02-08 21:14:23 Apparently Holyrood have just been given powers over onshore oil and gas licencing. This should lock the ban for as long as the SNP or Greens have power as they know Scots do not want fracking and will not exploit it.
1425 2018-02-08 21:14:04 i mean i could buy the oil tomorrow and not spend 12+ hours with bottles of oil in my bag but wheres the fun in that
1426 2018-02-08 21:14:04 yes depending on your skin type its nice tbh, i dont actually add in the oil i would just mix the foundation+oil or i would put it on right after applying oil to my face
1427 2018-02-08 21:13:52 Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:

1492 2018-02-08 21:04:54 If I am elected, my campaign will focus on developing more renewable energy resources and downsizing the coal/oil companies.
1493 2018-02-08 21:04:40 That support group has to be America.  

WE have to let them know that the old man sold them snake oil, and that it's okay, we all get 'had' once in a while.

If they can't look to their countrymen for help, then WE failed them.

And those that want to stay...

Fuck 'em.

1592 2018-02-08 20:51:12 Oil guy here, so don‚Äôt shoot the messenger. The argument is deforestation and the wide assortment of problems record amounts CO2 emissions cause and lead to.

1594 2018-02-08 20:51:06 Good luck in that meeting.
It seems that the one and only meeting to by your Administration to discuss oil drilling off the Coast of  California is very far from the Coast.
That seems unfair don't you think? You could do better. 
Will Court see prejudice in your action re FL?

1612 2018-02-08 20:49:35 the only age inappropriate beverage at my social gatherings is baby oil. it may be made for babies by babies but I live life on the edge
1613 2018-02-08 20:49:31 I used the PC benzoyl peroxide though...and it WORKED on reducing breakouts and oil. Then I let myself get scared off it by the mixed information about what can be used together and also by my vanity re: aging. 
1614 2018-02-08 20:49:22 oil change & full tank top 5
1615 2018-02-08 20:49:21 Drink dumb amounts of high ph water, lemon ginger tea, get a humidifier with pure eucalyptus oil in your room, rest loads. Good luck.
1616 2018-02-08 20:49:15 Guess I should go replace this high pressure oil line so I can reconnect the intake manifold and be done
1617 2018-02-08 20:49:13 Glad to know this but suspicious of US info. Disgusting what this so called 'War On Terror' (or WOT tf) has produced. Bringing out the worst in people all in the quest for drugs (Afghanistan) and oil and land resources
1618 2018-02-08 20:49:07 Forget climate. Real 'deniers' are BC voters who bought the NDP and Greens' electoral snake oil & were led to believe their new government has constitutional power to halt the KM pipeline. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli

1622 2018-02-08 20:48:28 It's tarsands, Syncrude called it that decades ago before they gave their dirty oil a makeover for those easily swayed by a less ugly name.
1623 2018-02-08 20:48:24 Collard greens are awesome!! I have bags of frozen collard greens in my freezer and they make a great breakfast. Heat em up in the microwave and put some coconut oil on em. Delicious.

1625 2018-02-08 20:48:20 The ABNDP has offered tax credits for value-added upgrading to oil sands projects, and I believe a refinery project has been recently announced.  Becoming the Librals in AB is laughable, though; ABNDP is a lot stronger than the Liberals.

1629 2018-02-08 20:48:02 Have you had the oil in the oven until it's very hot? And the oven at the highest temp without opening the door until it's done? Those are the most important. Not too much liquid too of course

1638 2018-02-08 20:47:06 You hide behind what's good for Canada, as an excuse of what's good for a huge international Texas based conglomerate. If BC lost 10's of 1,000's of jobs, property values become worthless, not good for Canada, & you & your big oil friends would just shrug your shoulders.

1646 2018-02-08 20:46:17 This articles says: "While Venezuela has diversified its exports in recent years, it still depends heavily on shipments to the U.S., where several refineries are designed to handle Venezuela's heavy crude." That¬¥s actually not true. Venezuela relies more and more on oil.
1647 2018-02-08 20:46:03 Oil share? All you get from oil is TAX on PROFIT. There is still very little profit, after decommissioning, etc.
1648 2018-02-08 20:46:03 I dont know if its true or not but solar is one of the biggest and fastest growing industries on the planet and in America.Instead of embracing,DJT is trying to sabotage it at the request of his donors in the oil and gas/fracking industry.I dont care which party does it,ITS WRONG
1649 2018-02-08 20:46:00 And did any of them ponder whether that might not be true? Or did they swallow their daily snake oil without question?
1650 2018-02-08 20:45:58 That‚Äôs no good.  Need a good pentrating oil to loosen it up.  Any luck getting another truck out there?
1651 2018-02-08 20:45:55 That's nice. I forgive you and your cohorts stupidity. Understandable. I pity you guys really. I see you as victims here of the snake oil Jesus con game, and of the brainwashing that religion requires to survive. Have a nice day!

1680 2018-02-08 20:42:48 Building all pipelines would be a little silly as some r redundant. The current govt is trying to get a couple built... hence my wine joke. I disagree about carbon tax. We need to diversify AB economy to not be so oil dependent and the US is a shit show so no thanks on last bit.
1681 2018-02-08 20:42:47 I don't need to read about 'your' palm oil it's as bad as everyone else's. RSPO is flawed. It cannot be traced to source and production is corrupt. Please provide palm oil free products so that consumers have a 'real' choice.

Every major scientific body and organization in the world endorses the science of AGW. Virtually the oil companies have statements acknowledging it.

1729 2018-02-08 20:37:32 That's a fair point, but oil companies ARE engaging in a criminal conspiracy to defraud the public. Really no different than supplement companies making unproven claims for their products. Key point is we can prove they know it's fraudulent-just like tobacco companies

1739 2018-02-08 20:36:38 Quick! I'm out of face cleanser and need to grab something cheap.but decent at Walgreens. What should I get?? (I do niacinamide & oil/moisturizer after it)
1740 2018-02-08 20:36:29 Even if oil revenue at pre-crash level was shared among 5.2 million people it would still be less than the fiscal transfer from UK.
1741 2018-02-08 20:36:28 The problem was being too afraid of telling LeBron to take a step back. For their sake, hopefully it is a lesson learned.
1742 2018-02-08 20:36:22 Small scale or large scale each community can decide it's own path to freedom from oil chains.
1743 2018-02-08 20:36:08 No jor suya meat + blended pepper and onions...fried dry with palm oil, with boiled yam. *heavenly*
1744 2018-02-08 20:36:05 ‚ÄòOil well test running, not gas leakage occurred in Koluama‚Äô
1745 2018-02-08 20:36:02 Medical marijuana oil has been clinically proven to be a powerful pain kiƒ∫ler. Legalised already!
1746 2018-02-08 20:35:57 Increasingly using set & forget orders.  Got these working out well once I started putting orders where I once put my stop. Surprisingly, most success with these in oil, wonky as that can be.
1747 2018-02-08 20:35:49 Mr man stop trying to be clever,thereby exposing your crudeness, people are watching, not everyone is gullible, I refuse to understand the paradox between being distinguished and ignorant, save yourself the shit.
1748 2018-02-08 20:35:47 I like it bitter! But I also like it slow cooked in a pan over a low flame for an hour or two with pepper flakes and lotsa oil. Depends what I'm cooking.
1749 2018-02-08 20:35:32 It's Big Brother. A house full of outcasts and weirdos.
1750 2018-02-08 20:35:30 Because women, trans and GLTBs are lining up to work in the mines, on oil rigs and constructing pipelines.

1753 2018-02-08 20:34:48 Renewable energy is a dream like perpetual motion fusion also that is the problem once you lose the portability of oil the game is up. No oil no big holes in the ground No oil no ore/oil carriers to ship stuff across the planet No oil no turbines no solar panels or EV's
1754 2018-02-08 20:34:45 like he mad because she fucking cooks with butter and not oil what oh fucking hell
1755 2018-02-08 20:34:34 Abdulyekeem Bolujoko received N50800 from Francis Oyebamiji being payment for Palm Oil
1756 2018-02-08 20:34:20 Given today‚Äôs news, @PWYPUSA may want to leave some comments.
1757 2018-02-08 20:34:19 Bringing my car in for its oil change tomorrow at 2, not sure if you‚Äôll be there, but it‚Äôs when I‚Äôll be there next, until those sweet Veloster N‚Äôs roll in (or I need another oil change) 
1758 2018-02-08 20:34:10 Nice drop after hours
1759 2018-02-08 20:34:07 Car insurance only insures against disaster. However, some people might like a nice comprehensive plan that includes oil changes if it was offered. It just isn't.
1760 2018-02-08 20:34:05 Oil is following the SPX blind leading the blind...
1761 2018-02-08 20:34:02 I'm back at Chicken Oil Company in Bryan, Texas tonight to host open mic! Come out sing a few songs and drink a few beers!!
1762 2018-02-08 20:33:40 Then the action of re tweeting his foolish utterance is in no difference a foolish and immature action from you,thereby encouraging his unwarranted utterance.

1764 2018-02-08 20:33:03 one time i left a bottle of olive oil at maria's house so i went back to get it and i found her gently caressing the olive oil while crying
1765 2018-02-08 20:32:53 I hope Metal Focus essential oil is good for your skin...since I just took a bath in it.
1766 2018-02-08 20:32:51 I believe u just gave massive credit to the idiots who caused the problem in the first place, brother
1767 2018-02-08 20:32:40 Thanks. But coconut oil can actually dry your face out too 
1768 2018-02-08 20:32:28 I have a bad habit of using too much oil & water in my hair when it‚Äôs time for me to go to work... shit be dripping all down my face & neck smh.
1769 2018-02-08 20:32:27 @FortniteGame i have a idea. My idea is IF you could drive cars in fortnite but you need oil
1770 2018-02-08 20:32:24 Undoubtedly and a new currency without v large foreign reserves would trade low. A currency underwritten by rUK would be the best deal but again would be negotiated against oil and fishing etc
1771 2018-02-08 20:32:07 I need not endorse anyone. We are all sharing and learning from one another. I‚Äôm No One and there is no vertical Collectivism on my TL. Everyone is a Distinguished including your ignorant self.
1772 2018-02-08 20:31:51 omg i do these really nice potatoes chop them like chips and coat them in paprika black pepper and other seasoning with olive oil in the oven and it‚Äôs 
1773 2018-02-08 20:31:43 Eucalyptus oil. Cleans that right up, quick smart.
1774 2018-02-08 20:31:33 Im sorry did u say conventional oil?
1775 2018-02-08 20:31:32 Everyone is sick at my job and this lady is making me eat these little essential oil balls and they're disgusting
1776 2018-02-08 20:31:21 im liking this rose hip oil on my skin 
1777 2018-02-08 20:31:18 So, stay away from fish oil too??
1778 2018-02-08 20:31:18 unless Lebron suggested these trades:)
1779 2018-02-08 20:31:16 two things that i believe have SERIOUSLY helped my skin:
- collagen supplementation (pills)
- evening primrose oil (instead of fish oil!)
1780 2018-02-08 20:30:43 OIL DIFF: 3.86 -> 4.0
1781 2018-02-08 20:30:42 This is another foolish utterance while grandstanding. My retweets & likes are not endorsements. It is boldly written in my profile. I like what I will likely address and shed more light on and I retweet what I want others to see and comment on for dialogue.
1782 2018-02-08 20:30:26 UAE is small village state and she be told to behave despite her oil wealth
1783 2018-02-08 20:30:26 What's the point of this history lesson, remembered correctly or otherwise?  I can't even remember if I voted then, since I'd just discovered Light & Bitter.  We're certainly getting conned now by those offering us cake and then imploring us to eat it.  Snake oil more like.
1784 2018-02-08 20:30:04 Alan Jones is like a Snake Oil salesman of old,  he works on the premise that with the right energy applied anything trivial can seem important and any falsehood can seem a reality. Alan is a walking, talking Psy Op.
1785 2018-02-08 20:30:01 Not really‚ÄîIndy Scotland wouldn't have billions to counter, unless the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Oil Boom all arrived simultaneously.
1786 2018-02-08 20:29:54 I‚Äôve been waiting on KD since 3 to come change my oil  I‚Äôm about to take a nap!!
1787 2018-02-08 20:29:46 And in completely unrelated news, demand for oil slowing along side impending price drop.
1788 2018-02-08 20:29:44 I'm pretty sure off camera these ppl spend most of their time curled up like frightened Pangolins. 
Not #MAGA material.
1789 2018-02-08 20:29:42 Use coconut oil
1790 2018-02-08 20:29:38 Oil drilling would be fine if there were no such thing as human error.

1792 2018-02-08 20:29:11 Give the Cavs massive credit for gutting their team over the course of a few hours and improving immediately. Another reminder that allowing your star player to dictate who needs to be on the roster isn't the wisest of directions to go. #NBATradeDeadline
1793 2018-02-08 20:29:09 nice! i like the other stuff that hemp oil does as well, ive used it for pain and muscel spasticity. my mum has CP and she really finds it helps.
1794 2018-02-08 20:28:45 only oil ive ever used for mine is the beard club sandalwood oil which is fantastic. smells wonderful. also either a good wood comb or board bristle brush :)
1795 2018-02-08 20:28:39 I can‚Äôt wait to try this coconut oil deep conditioning treatment 
1796 2018-02-08 20:28:36 Oil of Oregano & lots of water.  Feel better!
1797 2018-02-08 20:28:21 is this in addition to an oil spill near Port Elizabeth / Gilford Island being investigated by DFO Victoria
1798 2018-02-08 20:28:20 Where does this fall in your makeup routine? After serum and before oil or primer???
1799 2018-02-08 20:28:16 Spending trillions of tax dollars to go murder poor brown people and steal their oil is way better than supporting daca.  Great logic. Tomi you should go to Syria, Lybia, Iraq, Afghanistan or any of the other 8 countries you're bombing to check out those tax dollars hard at work
1800 2018-02-08 20:28:14 There is oil spilling in the Ocean all the time naturally under water. Oil just naturally bubbles up from the ocean floor
1801 2018-02-08 20:28:13 If I had the sense to ignore foolish tweets like this,then I see no reason why the omini knoweth of all things should re tweet this as an endorsement.
1802 2018-02-08 20:28:06 As long as the oil sands are being expanded Alberta is giving lip service to starting.
1803 2018-02-08 20:28:05 Lathered myself in tanning oil, put on a sports bra & shorts & hopped on the bike. I‚Äôm taking full advantage of this weather
1804 2018-02-08 20:28:02 Cold pressed sunflower oil?
1805 2018-02-08 20:28:01 How do you cook rapini/broccoli raab? I rough chop, toss with olive oil and salt. Pan roast at 450 for 7 mins, Shake and then 5 more mins. It's not so bitter or I'm so sweet it doesn't matter. 
I don't understand the too bitter response.

1810 2018-02-08 20:27:27 We don‚Äôt have to trust any one apart from us,Qataris also think we‚Äôre threat since we‚Äôll be pumping oil soon
1811 2018-02-08 20:27:23 You need Wall Street Banksters, the Carlyle Group Lobbyists, Media Moguls and Oil and Pharma to fund your GOTV campaigns
We don't, neither do Trump Supporters, we proved that in 2016
 They're terrible allies; but your "Natural Allies" are psychopathic zombie ticks and tapeworms
1812 2018-02-08 20:27:15 Enjoy killing the planet and eating food laced with toxins and dioxins. No oil. Widespread fracking. Massive overpopulation. Drought etc.
1813 2018-02-08 20:27:13 This needs to be done with careful consideration. If the demand for palm oil subsides, it will be better for the environment. People will 
do whatever it takes to survive. There needs to be an industry that can replace the palm oil industry that will not harm the environment.
1814 2018-02-08 20:27:09 Putin won't stop attacking our govt til Tillerson lifts all sanctions vs Russia & delivers the $500 billion oil deal as promised.
1815 2018-02-08 20:27:09 My kids loved pasta, with a 3 ‚Ç¨  pesto (bio, w/o any harmful ingredients); I‚Äôve stretched with a bit Olive oil and 2 courgettes. 6 ‚Ç¨ for four, handmade, smelling lovely‚Ä¶
1816 2018-02-08 20:27:08 I got my oil changed for half off, a free car wash, I didn‚Äôt have to go to work but I‚Äôm still getting paid, this man just paid for my food, and it‚Äôs not even 3pm. I hope everyone else is having as great of a day as I am.
1817 2018-02-08 20:27:01 Well thanks, but I currently use a bunch of crap :D Got a lot of stuff at Christmas so I'm interested in seeing what others like/use as I'm still trying to find "my brand". Who do you use for oil?
1818 2018-02-08 20:27:01 It's not a lobby group, it's hundreds of thousands of oil industry workers that would benefit from the additional investment due to the increased export capacity.  I like to feed my family too, but maybe you couldn't give a shit.
1819 2018-02-08 20:26:58 that's so annoying. Now sometimes, I double up on things like argan oil or coconut oil if I can.
1820 2018-02-08 20:26:55 making it by grace and peppermint essential oil alone.
1821 2018-02-08 20:26:50 NEVER.  I'm even half lib (love environ...hate oil drilling, i even originated Butterfly Bill in CA Assembly!...hate "too big too fail" banks....and we now know exactly where you 'stand'. Shame.  Dreamers important...but so all 320 million Americans. We used to really like you!
1822 2018-02-08 20:26:28 I don‚Äôt use oil to heat my home or fly anywhere. I only drive my car when absolutely necessary, less than 8000 km a year. If all lived like me, we wouldn‚Äôt need1/4 of the oil we use and we wouldn‚Äôt have climate change. #tarsands
1823 2018-02-08 20:26:25 Ur assuming the oil Industry lobbyists won't do everything to stop this, thus the activism needed
1824 2018-02-08 20:26:19 Why make a cake with water and oil when you can use milk and butter and tastes better?
1825 2018-02-08 20:26:15 i put tea tree oil on my pimple this morning and the pimple is gone already!
1826 2018-02-08 20:26:15 So @SenTedCruz is an ethanol lobbyist now?  It‚Äôs always easy to blame someone else while you protect oil interests!
1827 2018-02-08 20:26:13 Basically I have my oil changed on time because of him
1828 2018-02-08 20:26:12 When he was an attorney in his home state of Texas or Oklahoma he sued the EPA on behalf of oil companies. This is now the man in charge of the EPA.  Putting the fox in charge of the hen house is never a good idea.

1831 2018-02-08 20:25:59 Definitely a boar bristle brush. I gotta brush (never comb) my beard or it looks like an inverted Bob Ross.

I like oils. Tree Ranger is a wonderful, woodsy beard oil that makes me wanna hike naked.
1832 2018-02-08 20:25:55 do y‚Äôall remember the gang in oil city
1833 2018-02-08 20:25:50 Castor oil lol my hair is finally growing back on the sides
1834 2018-02-08 20:25:50 @petenajarian I can't believe the Airlines aren't flying higher with oil near $60, $ALK stated the would have done better if the fuel costs didn't jump so much last year! Their expenses rose about 75% from 2016!
1835 2018-02-08 20:25:46 Lo tuyo lo tuyo ser√≠a imitar al Divo de Ju√°rez. De nada.
1836 2018-02-08 20:25:34 my supplement recomendations are: hemp oil, probiotic and magnusium. also d-manose powder for utis bc it works super well
1837 2018-02-08 20:25:21 In  with the @ApothekariSkin AHA-Mazing Clean Exfoliating Cleanser!! The natural peppermint scent from the essential oil is refreshing and the cleanser leaves my face feeling soft - not tight & dry like some others. Removes dirt and makeup thoroughly too. 
1838 2018-02-08 20:25:19 So far, I‚Äôve discovered three things that work. Evening Primrose Oil has made a huge impact in my irritability and mood over the past week, geranium oil in my electric diffuser is a little anxiety miracle and Replens has stopped me rubbing coconut oil on my bits!  #menopause
1839 2018-02-08 20:25:12 Your fake as best as I can see
1840 2018-02-08 20:25:12 I don‚Äôt know you, but I learned most acne is caused by dry skin so use really good moisturizer! And rosehip oil is amazing!!
1841 2018-02-08 20:25:12 I thought it was a good goal...I think it is on the same level as when Strome's goal was called back against Calgary. NHL admitted they screwed up the call on Stromes goal but I am ok if going forward situations like this are called a good goal, just has to be consistent.
1842 2018-02-08 20:24:42 Could have been worse...have you ever dropped a bottle of olive oil? good to speak today, thanks
1843 2018-02-08 20:24:36 I've been mixing lavender oil with water and spraying in the room. Patients love it!
1844 2018-02-08 20:24:15 nail hardener is sold with nail polish, make sure you get the oil and not just the clear coat polish that goes on top of polish. There's also nail specific glue to repair hang nails- might be handy.

1847 2018-02-08 20:24:02 Waiting on this oil change. This  in my sock seems to be very audible.
1848 2018-02-08 20:23:40 Shrink acne by placing a wrapped ice cube on it and leave it on the pimple for 3 minutes. Then cover it with a dab of lavender oil.
1849 2018-02-08 20:23:38 Cannabis oil tastes like eating hay so now I have this awful taste left in my mouth that nothing can get rid of
1850 2018-02-08 20:23:30 It's up to the people not to buy the snake oil.
1851 2018-02-08 20:23:26 This is going to sound ignorant--but geranium essential oil is my favorite

1855 2018-02-08 20:23:02 DID MARTHA STEWART DELETE "OIL"
1856 2018-02-08 20:22:54 Why did I just get an e mail asking if I would like to buy an oil painting celebrating the Justin Bieber-Selena Gomez reunion? What list have I got myself on?
1857 2018-02-08 20:22:47 Water is the next "oil" and will also be fought over.
1858 2018-02-08 20:22:45 If we could believe what you say, that you live by these words and actions. But tonight or tomorrow you will slam the very institutions that make this country free. So hold you tongue and don‚Äôt try to sell us your snake oil. Start acting Presidential. Stop lying.
1859 2018-02-08 20:22:41 Oil workers must have blown her off by now
1860 2018-02-08 20:22:40 There is ALWAYS surplus oil floating around on the seven seas waiting for a buyer. I would be very surprised if the same wasn't true for #LNG.
1861 2018-02-08 20:22:34 I'm so lazy to go get an oil change
1862 2018-02-08 20:22:30 Those were really stubborn demons.. no anointing oil strong enough could kill them
1863 2018-02-08 20:22:15 ?
1864 2018-02-08 20:22:02 The privileged woes of: gettin out the 2 hr bath, latherin up in some shea butter n coco oil, and immediately havin ta douce. Is there an app for that?

1866 2018-02-08 20:21:41 thin mints r vegan

they have palm oil which isn‚Äôt very sustainable but they‚Äôre vegan
1867 2018-02-08 20:21:29 That's true. I just wish they at least poured some oil on Hardy. Otherwise it looks like a fan trailer since it doesn't show the star & symbiote, beyond a few frames. I could edit video to color a few frames. ;-)
1868 2018-02-08 20:21:23 Castor Oil Isn‚Äôt For Human Consumption. I Don‚Äôt Care.
1869 2018-02-08 20:21:20 Yeah...lol, you're not gonna love what I'm about to tell you...lots of antinuke stuff has historically been funded by KGB/USSR/Russia. And the oil industry. Not so much KGB here, but definitely in Europe, particularly Germany.
1870 2018-02-08 20:20:49 Aunt me toh quality
1871 2018-02-08 20:20:36 You know it's pretty clear that like his oil rich pandering father GHB, GW @GWBLibrary did nothing to stop illegals or secure our borders because he like his twerp brother also grew up profiting from working illegals as low paid slaves.  I use to support, Bush's are disgraceful!
1872 2018-02-08 20:20:18 YES MAGNUSIUM IS THE BEST. ive been using it for years to keep me mobile bc its a light muscel relaxant! it might make younfeel a bit dizzy if you take too much! also hemp oil tablets are awesome bc they work like a fish oil tab
1873 2018-02-08 20:20:14 tea tree oil also helps for spot treatment 
1874 2018-02-08 20:20:11 But we need the noble illegal alien to survive?
Dems and open borders crowd say they work for less than crumbs. #LiberalLogic
1875 2018-02-08 20:20:00 Dear Toyota thank you for putting your oil filter right next to the exhaust sincerely my burnt ass hand
1876 2018-02-08 20:19:57 what an arse
1877 2018-02-08 20:19:48 With the multitude of stupid laws that CA has, why don‚Äôt they require that the pharmacies take back unused medications free of charge? Stores that sell motor oil have to take used motor oil.
1878 2018-02-08 20:19:45 .. khloe vele Abe nje a serious demon that even anointing oil won't kill
1879 2018-02-08 20:19:39 Honestly, if an oil lobby advocacy group is unhappy, I'm happy. And I've never heard any other country say that about us recently so...#cdnpoli
1880 2018-02-08 20:19:38 I‚Äôm Team Gallo here. Oil diffusers are for people with their own office. If you oil my cube farm, I will poop in one of your desk drawers. THAT‚Äôs the Chicago way.
1881 2018-02-08 20:19:35 Followed all these great Patriots! PLZ Follow back

1882 2018-02-08 20:19:30 I need oil so badly 
1883 2018-02-08 20:19:20 This is my conundrum!! I think good fresh thick steak fries roasted in lots of oil and pepper come first for me, but French fries and chipper are tied.
1884 2018-02-08 20:19:14 my nails keep tearing. like paper. I'm already using nail hardener oil, but I'm seriously considering (non dog) biotin supplements.
1885 2018-02-08 20:19:13 Oil.
1886 2018-02-08 20:19:12 One of the big losers in the current Dow crisis is Oil and one of the winners is gold.  That combination is never a good indication.  The numbers internationally are also disconcerting and indicate increased volatility.  We need some stabilization soon to stop the bleed.

1892 2018-02-08 20:18:27 Be address by someone since our leaders are lookin the other way. So pls stop being bias and talk more to ur pple to desist from killing
1893 2018-02-08 20:18:25 Please Naomi keep tweeting against this kind of GREED AND CORRUPTION. Japan is already almost surrounded by oil from the Sanchi Sinking and Japan is 10 times the size of Vancouver Island. We are not being parochial in BC we are concerned about our very life and whole economy.
1894 2018-02-08 20:18:25 I don‚Äôt mean to brag but I slid into a babe‚Äôs DM and she sent me a pic of her throwing baby oil into the bin.
1895 2018-02-08 20:18:21 Ahhhh you‚Äôve definitely said this before and I couldn‚Äôt work it out... I think you‚Äôre going for a combo of ‚Äúburning the midnight oil‚Äù and ‚Äúburning the candle at both ends‚Äù 
1896 2018-02-08 20:18:18 I will massage you from scalp to toes with sandalwood-scented oil, I will bake you a tiramisu and feed it to you, but fuckit,  I'll be damned if I spend $60 on cut flowers.
1897 2018-02-08 20:18:17 @BadHombreNPS @cbsnews @nbc @abc @cnn But it ain't gonna help his controllers the Koch Bros or Putin  sell oil now is it? what a maroon  #altgov #theresistance #resist
1898 2018-02-08 20:18:01 Who else would I be?
I tried being the Stay-Puff marshmallow man but the weight was hard on my knees.

1902 2018-02-08 20:17:42 Go to Morristown all the time to the dealership to have my oil changed!
1903 2018-02-08 20:17:27 Ive spent the last 20 minutes wondering why I kept smelling my body scrub (salt and coconut oil) and then I realized the guy next to me was eating dried salted coconut
1904 2018-02-08 20:17:26 Thanks, but it really is taking time. The oil price has dropped twice
1905 2018-02-08 20:17:26 Mom said to make sure I massage the coconut oil into the kale before putting it in the oven. So basically it gets more TLC than me 
1906 2018-02-08 20:17:20 we need to look at the bigger picture & end goal,nothing will come good from forcing BC into a corner,it would come back to haunt AB.BC is not stupid wo pipeline/fossil fuel alternatives they will be stuck w tankers/rail & oil from questionable sources.
1907 2018-02-08 20:17:17 And start preaching peace and harmony? To who? To ur pple that value there cattle more than humans life? Pls get sense. This issue needs to
1908 2018-02-08 20:17:02 I wonder if my neighbor have Oil Down, could do with a 3rd plate.
1909 2018-02-08 20:17:00 Lol I put olive oil lemon n a lil salt delicious 
1910 2018-02-08 20:16:56 Thread: Companies earn their profits by exploiting their environment. Mining and oil companies exploit the physical environment; social media companies exploit the social environment.
1911 2018-02-08 20:16:48 Essential oils.

You know I‚Äôm not super crunchy- but Neti Pot with a few drops of tea tree oil and frankincense... it stings but it helps.
1912 2018-02-08 20:16:40 
1913 2018-02-08 20:16:32 Got an oil change and the man asked me regular oil and I said yes but then another man asked me again and I said full synthetic and I got charged for regular so idk what they put in my car 
1914 2018-02-08 20:16:08 I think the smell(s) that most define my childhood are also hair related, whether it was oil, gels, pomade, shampoos, and cooking. But also, colors and smells meld together for me and my childhood felt ripe with yellow and greens.
1915 2018-02-08 20:15:59 Anna Bligh has made the short walk from politician to snake oil salesman/ lobbyist. The banks use your credit history as a baseball bat for some & an opportunity for others. They should not have your personal information they are not fit to be trusted with it. #auspol #BanksRC
1916 2018-02-08 20:15:44 The oil kinda tricks your skin into thinking it‚Äôs already produced enough oil already.
1917 2018-02-08 20:15:39 They're also useful for filtering oil from the deep fryer, draining ricotta or yogurt, and other similar uses...
1918 2018-02-08 20:15:20 We Don't need the oil! Exxon & Shell just  want more money.
1919 2018-02-08 20:15:18 GEORGE W BUSH GO HAVE YOURSELF A DRINK ! WMD, IRAN WAR THATS NEVER ENDING, YOU BUSHES IN WITH SAUDI ARABIA OIL! GET LOST GEORGE & TAKE LITTLE CRYING NO ENERGY JEB WITH YOU!!
1920 2018-02-08 20:15:02 That killed 73 pple in benue. So you are saying we should overlook the menace and the madness your pple  are constituting in the country....
1921 2018-02-08 20:14:49 Back in high school, we are taught how oil companies screwed up areas like Athabasca.

So imagine who will pay the price when disaster happens when #KinderMorgan spills?

The kids of today will deal with the mess you old generation decide on. Sad.
1922 2018-02-08 20:14:39 I remain in Buenos Aires. My favourite trivia gleaned from the trip? When the British advanced through the city in 1807 locals repelled them, responding by pouring cauldrons of hot oil from their balconies.
1923 2018-02-08 20:14:33 Good lord almighty . A master snake oil salesman talking to his sheep about god.
1924 2018-02-08 20:14:22 Oh really that sad 'you dont use oil' run hahaha. Yes, I use oil, becuz my Gov refuses to invest in clean tech - which would make it affordable & accessible. The #carbontax (increased on us due to pipeline) is a poor tax on those of us who cant afford a new electric car or solar.
1925 2018-02-08 20:14:09 Oh it's not super easy to smudge at all! But I see people every day saying they went to lunch and it stayed on the whole time, that they needed oil to get it to budge..... like, uh, that's not what it's supposed to do as a lip "paint"
1926 2018-02-08 20:14:02 Repeated oil spills that devasted coastal lands, water, jobs, sport hunting & fishing, economies, and ways of life. You'll need more gas to escape to non-polluted lands.
1927 2018-02-08 20:13:57 It‚Äôs a multitude of industries utilising palm oil and mass deforestation‚Äôs on behalf of corporate organisations. The farmers are not the root of the problem. Farmers and humans are killing Orangs because we‚Äôve encroached on thier habitat which they try to return to.
1928 2018-02-08 20:13:53 It would hoepfully much less destructive to the environment than coal mining, gas mining, oil mining & fracking. All these industries are run by tax avoiding companies who transfer most of the cost to taxpayers & profit to tax havens.
A new environmentally safe competitor?
1929 2018-02-08 20:13:25 Oh come on, people thought fat and eggs were bad and whole grains / vegetable oil were awesome
1930 2018-02-08 20:13:14 Beiping sits there on a low stool in his blue silk weskit moving only to lightly dab more oil on his brush - the background - sanding, sawing, sporadic hammering and one guy with a rough throated cough. Cool Dude!

1933 2018-02-08 20:12:56 Oh wow, there's a JustEat place that actually delivers here. ¬£20 minimum spend with a ¬£5 delivery fee on top, and they use sesame oil exclusively, so I can never order from there, but still!
1934 2018-02-08 20:12:43 That is true, because palm oil is a crop and therefore unable to kill...
But without the palm oil, the workers would not have the incentive TO kill.
1935 2018-02-08 20:12:41 @segalink won't be able to say this because he's a public figure but I will say it on his behalf, you are no different from those Fulani...
1936 2018-02-08 20:12:38 @Ariens What kind of oil is recommended for a snow blower model 938017?
1937 2018-02-08 20:12:34 There are 2 kinds of people:
- those who don‚Äôt know what peal oil is
- those who don‚Äôt care what Brett Stephens thinks about it
1938 2018-02-08 20:12:34 You don't have to say "I Love You" to your Dad. Just tell him you had your oil changed. Same thing.
1939 2018-02-08 20:12:23 Virginias new law regarding cbd and thc oil for medical use is big news your not hearing about
1940 2018-02-08 20:12:16 I‚Äôd like to see some actual, HONEST, numbers on how the pipeline will benefit/hurt AB, BC, and Canada.  I‚Äôm not convinced it really helps anyone but the oil companies themselves
1941 2018-02-08 20:12:04 Maybe some of this junk can be delivered to the doorstep of Oil CEO's so they get the message.  Ask them to take a drink.
1942 2018-02-08 20:11:58 
it did smell v nice, although i might have overdid the essential oil a bit - it overwhelmed the herbs
1943 2018-02-08 20:11:56 Where‚Äôd you buy your oil from?
1944 2018-02-08 20:11:56 Sad fact seems to be this is an acceptable cost to some. It's just the price THEY are willing to pay for moral superiority.
1945 2018-02-08 20:11:39 Hey @cnn @msnbc @nbc Where is your stories on the uranium one scandal? Shouldn‚Äôt you be reporting all the news to the American people?  We see why you‚Äôre known as #fakenews You refuse to report all the real news.  #ClintonCrimes #ObamaGate #lowratings

1948 2018-02-08 20:11:15 I don‚Äôt trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for cassava flour muffins made with tapioca flour, and put some musk essential oil in my diffuser.
1949 2018-02-08 20:11:04 Seems dubious, but it is all we have.  Now every talking head is on about the 2 week increase, and projecting it as the new normal weekly production output increase, like shale oil production is just a valve stem with a 300' thread, with 280' feet left to unwind.

1962 2018-02-08 20:09:30 Nobody is talking about the BC economy that relies HEAVILY on a clean coast for fishing, tourism, etc. Fed's oil spill cleanup regime CANNOT cleanup RAW BITUMEN!

2004 2018-02-08 20:04:09 Very bad, for one thing, why?
And when oil is depleted, will

Than there's the spills, when
initially the companies act as
if a spill, is no problem and
always fudge the damage and
waffle on paying damages, but
countries continue to prop them
up.

2013 2018-02-08 20:03:09 Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout) | foundersbrewing

I'm really happy I bought it to finally have one of the year,
Black as oil with a complex delicious beer,
Flavors of chocolate, vanilla hits when it first came out,
One of the best barrel aged imperial coffee stout
2014 2018-02-08 20:02:57 Before it went did ya check the oil
2015 2018-02-08 20:02:49 Try tea tree oil, at the very least it will kill the bacteria that causes the inflammation which causes those pus boils.
2016 2018-02-08 20:02:48 It's kind of like Harper saying emissions were falling under his government without mentioning the oil crash the previous year.
2017 2018-02-08 20:02:27 Thanks, Canada. Solar is our future. Oil and coal are our past.

2020 2018-02-08 20:02:07 Yes. Because we have vast resources of Oil and Gas in balochistan & KP but unfortunately we are not using it.
2021 2018-02-08 20:01:58 I took a look at what it would take to replace just the fat component fr dairy w a plant based fat: the only type that could scale up to req'd amt is palm oil --  the GHGs & water use/kg fat are higher for palm than dairy, it depletes doesn't restore soil & is not local for most
2022 2018-02-08 20:01:54 Right. Doesn't help us in SoCal at all! We can see the oil rigs off the coast here!

2024 2018-02-08 20:01:50 Until they dump toxins in rivers along the reservations like Obama‚Äôs EPA did, they‚Äôre OK in my book. Nerve gas has been around since before the NAZIs, but I guess if you connect the dots, Trump/Russia/Big Oil are out to destroy us. You‚Äôre so far removed from DA Reagan.. #ourloss.

2034 2018-02-08 20:00:30 Technical trading rules have been tested in peer reviewed academic publications. None of them beat passively holding the market index when returns are adjusted for risk and trading costs. This suggests Frans is selling snake oil.

2038 2018-02-08 20:00:11 No, never work in or worked for oil, aside from a gas station clerk in my teens. I just believe the only truly clean transportation is my bicycle. Anything else is a compromise at one end or the other. Of course a bike isn't always prudent.
2039 2018-02-08 19:59:39 I remember i was lost for like 2 days first time I heard girl say "Earl" but she meaning "Oil"
2040 2018-02-08 19:59:36 Sessions is a despicable creature. The entire "war" against natural Hemp/Cannabis oil CBD's etc are nothing to do with "drugs" as they don't contain THC - it's a scam to hand Big Pharma the fake "legal synthetic" CBD pain killer market. Making Dollars not curing pain. Disgusting!

2047 2018-02-08 19:58:51 @peaceliberty @barbarastarrcnn  forgot to mention that US in Syria illegally! are warring to oust Assad & steal oil reserves
2048 2018-02-08 19:58:46 What is the mistake the researchers are making?  Can you clarify? Also please remember that many ppl are using medical marijuana w/o the THC and many actually credit the CBD oil with the benefits.
2049 2018-02-08 19:58:46 Low oil pressure more than likely if oil level ok. Could be bad pressure sending unit, a blocked oil passage or a failing oil pump. You wouldn't want to drive it much!
2050 2018-02-08 19:58:45 Forte oil, Total and NNPC are the only true players in this season of queueing and eztreme hardship plus rising polispheric temperatures.
2051 2018-02-08 19:58:31 Our 'National Interests' appear to be stealing Syria's oil fields and protecting terrorists.  Americans are seriously hated throughout the world for all the atrocities we've committed in various countries.

2054 2018-02-08 19:57:45 I recall a Brexitidiot MP, (I think Owen Paterson) who suggested we should negotiate and sign free trade agreements before we left the EU, in contravention of EU regs. as they wouldn't be able to do anything about it. Snake oil salesmen are not to be trusted
2055 2018-02-08 19:57:41 @Bubba_Trading Just to go on record again. I said $60 + oil during 2018 and a $70 hit in May/June.  Today it looks like I might be slipping on this one as WTI approaches $60.  Thanks again!
2056 2018-02-08 19:57:40 Guess the massive 2015 oil spill in the river has faded from the BLM's minds.

2076 2018-02-08 19:54:51 While #EaglesParade is trending: Hey NFL! Let players use CBD oil and CBD rich medical marijuana. 
2077 2018-02-08 19:54:39 I fully expect the UAE to try to sell the oil back to us.  The Democrats will declare that we are racist for not buying the oil back.  The media will declare us transphobic for not buying the oil back.
2078 2018-02-08 19:54:33 I respect Lee Kwan Yew, Deng Xiaoping and Al Maktoum of Dubai.

These leaders worked hard to create knowledge based economies; Nigeria's leaders on the other hand, have weaponized poverty and ignorance - & thus have tied our collective fates to the price of a barrel of crude oil.

We're raising our prices while lowering everyone else's. Why not build more nuclear, then we won't have to worry about it?

2129 2018-02-08 19:46:41 Russia has consolidated and reconciled N.Korea with USA, also the same on Egypt and Turkey with Israel in a very short time! how and why? is it political game hell-NO!!
the answer is MEGA corruption!!, OIL and stealing taxes is the new trend.
2130 2018-02-08 19:46:36 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
2131 2018-02-08 19:46:35 Oh no the oil companies paid for a lot of research too their interests are obvious. The state simply wants answers. I don't do crackpot conspiracy theories btw.
2132 2018-02-08 19:46:34 If conventional practices were subject to the same scrutiny as ‚Äúsnake oil‚Äù products I promise that the world of Ag would look VERY different.

2134 2018-02-08 19:46:18 need to take their oil first
2135 2018-02-08 19:46:14 This is not normal. This is what Washington becomes when you have a snake oil peddler for president and a bunch of carpetbaggers as Representatives and Senators.
2136 2018-02-08 19:46:11 Actually, surveys suggest a division on the issue.  Yes, lots of people in BC don't want to see new/expanded oil pipelines.  But a sizable chunk of the electorate supports the project.  And don't forget: the BC Liberals, who said, 'yes,' won more votes than the NDP in May 2017.
2137 2018-02-08 19:46:08 a) capital destructive behaviors
b) wildcatter who refuse to change their ways
c) no fcf so continuous dilution
d) too much supply of oil / gas
e) everything else been working so no bid for sector
f) fool me once shame on you... fool me twice shame on me (few greater fools left)

2141 2018-02-08 19:45:59 And the oil rig is dangerous because of the oil rig. Not because of the men on the oil rig, statistically. So you can see how we have been put in this situation by men specifically. It shouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúscary‚Äù to drive someone home. Can‚Äôt say the same about an oil rig.
2142 2018-02-08 19:45:52 Plus, oil tanker traffic won't ever stop on the coast, so wouldn't it be better to support Canadian crude instead of foreign crude?  Maybe we can supply the Burnaby refinery instead of Saudi Oil?
2143 2018-02-08 19:45:45 OK, cut off ALL OIL entering into califukyu.
2144 2018-02-08 19:45:32 This trade war is the funniest shit. Some Albertans are saying cut BC off entirely from the oil supply but the oil companies are like "nononono dont do that"
2145 2018-02-08 19:45:28 love coconut oil and jojoba oil! thank you for the chance.

2149 2018-02-08 19:44:53 I meant to say that thing eats oil. Burns through it fast
2150 2018-02-08 19:44:49 Cooking together is the best way to band practice. Really helps you pinpoint issues within the team like how Sean doesn't fucKING USE ENOUGH OIL
2151 2018-02-08 19:44:40 Jan Webb: every year, we‚Äôre burning coal, oil and gas that took about a million years to create #fsf2018
2152 2018-02-08 19:44:39 My dads suppose to do it. Clearly he‚Äôs only been focused on the oil
2153 2018-02-08 19:44:37 Basically, we need access to more refineries because it takes too long to build them all here.  They are being built regardless, but the demand for crude oil is huge.
2154 2018-02-08 19:44:30 There‚Äôs enough death to go around for all, the FF industry and everyone else. Keep using oil we‚Äôre all screwed, the only question is, who will finish 1st. OR, fossil fuel companies could shift investments to #renewables, and thrive in the 21st century economy.
2155 2018-02-08 19:44:20 Spicy indeed! Benzoquinone activates the same ion channel activated by capsaicin and the same ion channel activated by mustard oil. Potent! (love the beetle crawling for safety)

2174 2018-02-08 19:42:57 That didn't happen, since the Assad forces promptly moved on an oil/NG center and got pulverized for doing so.  The river remains the boundary.

2182 2018-02-08 19:41:21 Let people debate all they want but I am paying less than 2 cents per mile to power my EV which is a lot lower than oil fueled vehicle owners are paying.  Even at these current low, low prices for gas.
2183 2018-02-08 19:41:04 But the jobs for the pipelines aren‚Äôt in place yet. If oil HAS to be a thing, why not refine it in Alberta as well? Tons of jobs in that too. The coast is already in dire straights. Ocean animals are already in so much danger. There are alternatives #bcpoli #cndpoli

2188 2018-02-08 19:40:25 If you exclude a few weeks in 2009 and a few weeks in 2016 when oil was in $20s/30s, $XOP is about 10% from its all-time low in one of biggest bull markets in history.
2189 2018-02-08 19:40:19 For me onion, diced Habanero, mango, sweet corn, avacado with olive oil. Cold. With broiled snapper, Mahi, redfish etc.

2191 2018-02-08 19:40:15 Oil was basis of SNP's fiscal plan in 2014, despite their assertions that it was a 'bonus'. Their propaganda obviously worked well because four years later and despite the admission of one of their economists that it was a basis, you're still parroting the 'oil was a bonus' line.

Question:
Considering Turkey & Iran are unlikely partners of the #US & the the role of YPG fighters in the N.E, how is oil getting out of Syria?

ISIS sold oil back to Syrian gov but surely #Russia wouldn't agree to a similar arrangement with US?
2340 2018-02-08 19:24:02 I don't think ppl should have an opinion. My Sicilian grandmother would pour oil into a bowl next to candles and pray holding pictures of everyone sick in the family.

2361 2018-02-08 19:20:51 Certainly.

2362 2018-02-08 19:20:48 the USA occupying Syria and refusing to leave it won't be a war with Russia or China it would well destabilize the oil and world market

2375 2018-02-08 19:19:15 "Pretty sure" there's obviously a lot of research behind that assumption, (oh and coconut oil contains cholesterol btw, which animal do they come from exactly?), you obviously know your stuff
2376 2018-02-08 19:19:12 Also the cleansing oil is really nice but I feel like u achieve@the same thing as just using coconut oil to remove ur makeup. The rice enzyme powder is bs LMAOO idk what it does and I‚Äôve only used it 2-3 times and didn‚Äôt notice a difference
2377 2018-02-08 19:19:11 It‚Äôs not about fighting ISIS. It‚Äôs about continuing to destabilize the country and plunder Syria‚Äôs assets including its oil fields.
2378 2018-02-08 19:19:07 So I've been breaking out because apparently rosehip oil is meant to be diluted before used on the body....what a rookie error 
2379 2018-02-08 19:19:02 your oil companies treat u like a cash machine and northern AB like a toilet.  they are anything but responsible. their investments are materially reduced by *massive* govt subsidies.

2385 2018-02-08 19:18:17 No kidding.  This is excellent messaging for setting fan expectations.
2386 2018-02-08 19:18:14 The military are major contributors to CO2 and particalate matter, both through everyday emissions and actual warfare and destruction. The protection of oilfield is primary for the military, because without oil they couldn't fight. It seems they fight so they can fight some more.
2387 2018-02-08 19:18:04 I remember when I asked twitter what to use on my oily skin and they said coconut oil.  oil. On my oily skin?
2388 2018-02-08 19:17:48 I‚Äôve been waiting forever for a simple oil change. If it wasn‚Äôt free I‚Äôd blow this whole place up
2389 2018-02-08 19:17:32 I had a thought that mixing 1 part tea tree oil with 3 parts DMSO and applying it to the nail surface (NOT skin)might be a good idea for fighting nail fungus and google confirmed it. I also apply a few drops (just the tt oil) to the open end of the nail 2x day.
2390 2018-02-08 19:17:20 $75 for a fuckin oil change  if it wasn‚Äôt cold af I‚Äôd do it by myself but fuck that

2401 2018-02-08 19:15:12 Well, let's see. First the earth cooled. And then the dinosaurs came, but they got too big and fat, so they all died and they turned into oil...

2406 2018-02-08 19:14:44 Hi Frank. I have been reading articles, but I also visited Malaysian Borneo last year and I spoke to many Malaysians who felt the same way. They realised that they have become so reliant on Palm Oil and they desperately wanted an alternative, but had no choice.
2407 2018-02-08 19:14:34 Car oil so damn expensive
2408 2018-02-08 19:14:18 I've not had a GPS lock for some time, I'm assuming there's a problem, i'll reboot shortly and I need some oil, 5w30 will do.

2413 2018-02-08 19:13:56 If you don‚Äôt want the Oil . Stop using oil based products. Walk to work, rip up your asphalt roads, turn off your heat in your home, eat raw food , throw away your computer and cell phones and most importantly get off the grid.
2414 2018-02-08 19:13:44 I thought oil was the byproduct of ancient plants, but it turns out that ancient plants turned into coal, while oil comes from ancient aquatic life. Probably plankton type species in the millions? #Lesson5 #PHYS273
2415 2018-02-08 19:13:36 Very slanderous, but your point of view is just that, a point of view. You do realize that oil spills in America are a lot easier to clean up. Do some research and don‚Äôt jump to conclusions.

2430 2018-02-08 19:12:15 Thats what we want to know. The why is because Bush wanted a war. War makes money, he had connections with Cheney, etc. Bush even said in his autobio that he wanted to be a wartime president. Its all about oil and money, all of it. You know that Pete.

2449 2018-02-08 19:09:48 I think nuclear has an important role to play, but that doesn't mean I'm not actively pushing for other solutions as well.  Like I said, here in NYC we could use solar thermal with seasonal storage in districts to offset a vast amount of oil & NG.  I can't ignore that!

2544 2018-02-08 18:59:46 Since at least the 1970s, #Alberta has the authority to prohibit shipments of energy products outside the province.
Former PC premier Peter Lougheed once cut the volume of crude oil sent to eastern refineries, as part of his epic battle with #Ottawa over control of the industry.

2553 2018-02-08 18:58:58 Did you hear? In December, United Arab Emirates purchased crude oil from the U.S.A.
2554 2018-02-08 18:58:54 @cknw @MikeSmythNews caller said pipeline and oil companies go 'above and beyond' regulations.  If that was true, #KinderMorgan wouldn't be chopping down trees in Burnaby parks and putting plastic mats down in salmon-spawning streams to prevent spawning. They can't be trusted.
2555 2018-02-08 18:58:49 How does an increase in GHG emission from oil sands (and Alberta emissions projected to be around the same as their 2005 emissions) fit with the national GHG target - which you campaigned on as being too weak?

2564 2018-02-08 18:57:16 Still off sick from work and just finished watching Netflix‚Äôs #BigMen documentary about the oil industry in the Niger Delta. Exxon Mobil and Shell should lose everything they have for the devastation they‚Äôve caused in the region. Evil scheming fuckers.
2565 2018-02-08 18:57:14 Wasn't it just last year she was on TV whining about the poor economy in Alberta due to dropping oil prices. Wasn't it BC that stepped up to fight fires in Fort Mac ?

2572 2018-02-08 18:56:12 Hi Frank, perhaps you could explain why...? Palm oil may provide economic benefits to large companies and stake holders, but it detracts equal amounts from the local farmers and indigenous people who deserve better. It also greatly impacts the environment, across the whole globe.
2573 2018-02-08 18:56:04 That hand looks familiar.
2574 2018-02-08 18:55:54 .@netflix we've reached 85 days of me continuously tweeting you. You know what else was 85 days? The amount of time it took them to cap the oil leaking into the ocean after the Deepwater Horizon disaster. When are you gonna cap my need for Netflix + @Nintendo Switch?
2575 2018-02-08 18:55:53 I used to suffer with terrible earache as a child. My dear Dad would cut an onion in half, take the outer layer, fill it with olive oil & warm the oil over the hob, then pour it in my ear. The only thing that stopped it. (Make sure it‚Äôs just warm & put cotton wool in ear after)
2576 2018-02-08 18:55:25 no not pepperS, pepper like black pepper! i do it w olive oil
2577 2018-02-08 18:55:14 Ignoring small businesses in Alberta that are part of the oil patch is disengenuous. You need to provide a transition plan for those businesses. You also need to stop buying oil if you want people to stop selling oil. #climatechange #ClimateAction #StopDemandSide
2578 2018-02-08 18:55:04 Do you use this in combination with any other product? For instance, an oil to seal it in after a wash & go?
2579 2018-02-08 18:55:04 Please stop suggesting that *whatever oil* is the key to fixing everything. If a dab of peppermint behind my ear would make me sane, don‚Äôt you think I‚Äôd be doing that?

2595 2018-02-08 18:53:03 It's a way to avoid trenching using a flexible drill that can change direction. Probably a result of oil company innovations. I don't have a link, but remember seeing it in the past few years. If you don't have to dig things up it's a lot cheaper.

2627 2018-02-08 18:47:58 Its so nice to that Westminster lets scots keep ALL the oil revenue they are due as well as give us that 10BN to cover our deficit,they went to an illegal war in Iraq for oil,but its nice they let scots keep all of theirs
2628 2018-02-08 18:47:40 Looking at Canada only, for the same month and year: 

U.S. imported 3.986M bbl/d of crude oil & products, and exported 987K bbl/d. That makes our net imports from Canada = 2.999M bbl/d for Nov. '17.
2629 2018-02-08 18:47:34 Star boy enough oil dea ur head yaga @aro star brave boy
2630 2018-02-08 18:47:34 Much of the product that Cherry Point refinery uses is coming out of Alberta. The tap won't be turned off because the oil companies wouldn't agree to it. But the Washington State refiner minutes from the U-S/Canada line is a huge customer of #Alberta energy.
2631 2018-02-08 18:47:19 There could be oil of some kind involved hahahahaha
2632 2018-02-08 18:47:16 It was just bad. Weird aftertaste. Greasy film in my mouth after. Tastes like it is being cooked in a different kind of oil. Doesn't taste like it did back in the day.

2634 2018-02-08 18:46:52 Tweeps, I have a question! We are new to an oil heated house and I‚Äôm wondering, what‚Äôs the average that a house would spend on oil annually? (think large‚Äôish two story detached house)

2637 2018-02-08 18:46:47 I use shick intuition and I don't have that problem. It's nice only having to replace the heads and the grip is really nice. I use the coconut milk and almond oil heads and they work great with my sensitive skin.

2647 2018-02-08 18:44:43 I feel like the wealthy oil nations are trying to get a lot of people to immigrate out of their countries in the event that oil collapses and they're reduced to one again agrarian camel milk and carpet selling for money.
all that oil money just greasing the wheels to get them out

2664 2018-02-08 18:43:15 That is precisely why it is hurting in Alberta. There is more oil now than there has ever been in my lifetime.
2665 2018-02-08 18:43:11 Many Albertans get very upset with Quebec for not wanting our pipelines and all.

It's  super messed up because so much of our wealth came from oil and as such  anything seen as not directly supporting oil gets crapped on so hard.

I don't envy Notley trying to deal with this.
2666 2018-02-08 18:43:01 Still can't believe people out here eating coconut oil, how those oily poos treating you? 
2667 2018-02-08 18:42:51 @Sadafsda @alhuette48 Obviously you are very good at drawing, so that‚Äôs one!  I am sure you are just being modest!  I have tried oil painting, did not really like it! Did an acrylic painting of my mom and dad! We must keep trying always!

2669 2018-02-08 18:42:21 My girl rubbed peppermint oil behind my ears, to cure my hangover. My hangover is nearly gone.
2670 2018-02-08 18:42:10 I almost forgot about this. Time for longs to suffer. The narrative about China giving support to oil at 60 is running rampant. It should get crushed sooner than we think. The #OOTTmoron s on #OOTT can't word salad their way out of this :)
2671 2018-02-08 18:42:08 Many Televangelists are nothing more than Con Artists, the modern equivalent of A Snake Oil Salesman. And when they talk about not needing vaccines they are dangerous too.

2673 2018-02-08 18:41:53 Socialist Maduro & his predecessor Chavez w/their overly generous socialist welfare programs which are being hammered by declining oil prices are primarily responsible for the tumultuous mess in Venezuela...not the CIA. Venezuela needs a good dose of democracy & capitalism.
2674 2018-02-08 18:41:40 of course is business is always favor and influence is in need to make money and speed things up otherwise these minsters are not oil painting or queen beauty
2675 2018-02-08 18:41:36 In order to export oil, the US has to get it out of the ground. Well, it's doing that. Ergo, isn't more oil getting out of the ground of the US, than anywhere else?
2676 2018-02-08 18:41:33 Great post. I had never seen olive oil in this light. Will definitely look further into this as I must say, I've read so much on the topic. Thanks for sharing

2681 2018-02-08 18:40:59 Grapeseed oil too 
2682 2018-02-08 18:40:57 For Nov. '17: U.S. imported 9.783M bbl/d of crude oil & products, but exported 7.158M bbl/d. That makes our net imports = 2.625M bbl/d. 

Your math used gross imports from Canada to U.S., and did not account for U.S. exports to Canada.
2683 2018-02-08 18:40:46 Justin opposes oil and the oil sands!  That's why environmentalists voted for him??? Is this another broken election promise???

2694 2018-02-08 18:39:32 why petrol prices are on high whn crude oil is not much costly in international market.

2702 2018-02-08 18:39:01 Thanks for working hard to kill the middle class and those working hard to join it.

2703 2018-02-08 18:39:00 I live in Oklahoma. Republicans have RUINED our education system. Some schools are having to go to 4 days a week bc it's all they can afford. But oil executives are shovellin in the big bucks.

Also, we have earthquakes CONSTANTLY.

The downside correction in the Oil market is gaining momentum, with Brent crude  prices coming close to the $65 mark in Asia and hitting a 2018 low on  lingering concerns over surging U.S. output. #marketcorrection #bearmarket #trading
2706 2018-02-08 18:38:54 The federal gov. Is promising 1.5 B  coastal protection plan. Why are Canadian taxpayers on the hook to clean up a mess clearly created by American /multinational oil interests?
2707 2018-02-08 18:38:54 .. back to the people‚Äù. You‚Äôre giving it to greedy, polluting oil/coal companies. Pollution on top of excessive dry conditions hurt us & our health.

2708 2018-02-08 18:38:53 #BrexitImpact
In terms of operational costs, fuel is one of the more significant items  in the profit and loss accounts of transport companies. Oil is sold  around the world in US dollars, so a weakened sterling could have a  profound impact on fuel prices
2709 2018-02-08 18:38:43 it also had to not conflict with my beard oil, that'd be weird.
2710 2018-02-08 18:38:35 The route through the agricultural revolution to the industrial revolution the succession of charcoal coal then oil. Population growth sustained even through the exodus of people from the land. It deserves a mention I think!

2713 2018-02-08 18:37:54 We know who was colluding with the Russians.

The Clintons have a long history with Russia. In 1999, Bill wanted to send more aid to Russia but Congress wouldn't approve it. Instead, he helped crude oil prices to rise so Russia would get more per barrel and crashed our economy.

2727 2018-02-08 18:36:06 Albertans take a balnced approach to financial needs and environmental needs. Our oil companies have invested significant funds into developing safe transportation and responsible management of our resurces.Your assumptions are offensive.
2728 2018-02-08 18:36:03 Soak them in coconut oil to loosen the glue bond!!! This happened to me. But try and get them professionally removed because it can really damage your lashes if you rip them out yourself.

2733 2018-02-08 18:35:44 No, it is the people of BC supporting a government that is trying to protect the coast of BC from the inevitable oil spill. It's not the pipeline so much as the increase of marine traffic that will endanger our coastline, perhaps destroy it for years to come if there is a spill.

2739 2018-02-08 18:34:54 @RepTomReed 
I appreciate concern over deficit. Income, not taxes, needs to be addressed. Some type of income generaters need to be created. Spending is easy. Income other then taxes is not. Income from oil, etc needs to be thought of.
2740 2018-02-08 18:34:34 Wonderful prose style, Mr. Ortel. You manage to make the dose of ‚Äòswamp‚Äô oil more palatable.

2743 2018-02-08 18:34:29 In the refiner the diesel and fuel oil will be from the heavy crude as shale does not contain much of either. It means the sulphur concentration will be the same in those products as if you just ran the sulphur on its own. Only quality will change not quality of product
2744 2018-02-08 18:34:28 Okay, mommy I'm Drew till day Sarin and Seren will be here in 5 minutes or so. Take the fish oil so I can have one other sister?
2745 2018-02-08 18:34:14 U.S. advisers were present at the SDF installation, but U.S. officials believe the attack by pro-regime forces was aimed at seizing a nearby oil field, not at the Americans

2747 2018-02-08 18:33:58 So says a man who destroyed two modern monuments to chase a guy in the mountains and sneak into the house of a dictator to gain control over oil. Had only heard of burning house to kill the mouse, this man showed us how its done.

2773 2018-02-08 18:30:32 But you are right, let's pretend that Russia did not inherit most of the military capacities of the SU and has not been swimming in oil money for many years. If we do that, everything suddenly starts to look smart&strategic.

2778 2018-02-08 18:29:19 IMO won‚Äôt help as much as everybody thinks with Light sweet as IMO will require either low sulphur diesel or low sulphur fuel oil. It does not have either. Sulphur will still come out in diesel or fuel oil in same concentration because of no dilution.
2779 2018-02-08 18:28:26 BC is not trying to stop you exporting your oil. We are trying to protect our jobs and our coastline. Stop your childish behaviour. You are hurting your own service industry. Your climate protection plan is a joke.

2789 2018-02-08 18:26:16 @PnPCBC None of your pipeline commentators are talking about the devastating effects of an oil spill on the BC economy that relies HEAVILY on a clean coast for fishing & tourism etc. This is way MORE than just an environmental issue. Is Alberta's economy more important than BC's?

2814 2018-02-08 18:21:23 Of course, he left out resource wars because he didn't know how nonrenewable energy would turn out. So we have the military industrial complex & strategic oil conflicts all tied together.

2851 2018-02-08 18:16:46 Your pro #KinderMorgan pipeline expansion argument is intellectually dishonest because those tankers are importing a much safer crude then perhaps the most difficult oil (some say impossible) to cleanup eg. #tarsands #bitumen oil.

even further, do people really cook with butter?
2856 2018-02-08 18:16:05 Better technology is already disrupting energy markets. The only issue is time. And what happens if electricification of transport/displacement of oil occurs later rather than sooner.

2858 2018-02-08 18:15:49 How about using all of the subsidies big oil is getting? They govt does not need to spend hundreds of billions subsidizing profitable businesses. Imagine that ! Businesses who are profitable not getting govt welfare so that the govt can provide services for its citizens.

2862 2018-02-08 18:14:58 @AllenLone . Well what true disappointment. v.aao had so many press releases of all sorts. Today it sits at .025. What a shame. v.moo had Montana in play between $50-$60 oil. It sits at .01. Time for a new leader or the current one to step up.
2863 2018-02-08 18:14:53 @AmazonUK can you please thank which ever of your drivers it was that dumped our delivery of motor oil over our 6 ft back fence? I'm going to enjoy cleaning that up. #goodjob

2866 2018-02-08 18:14:34 Today‚Äôs Monday Magic is Clary Sage Oil. Though most well-known for its ability to ease menstrual cramps and balance hormones, Clary Sage Oil is also fantastic for beating insomnia. Used in a diffuser or simply sprinkled directly on a pillowcase, this substance will induce sleep.

2872 2018-02-08 18:13:45 They should block it. Geez, what are we going to do with so much Oil, production is at the peak already. Do they want to create another Oil crisis?
2873 2018-02-08 18:13:43 Apparently you're not familiar with the economic consequences of #RFS mandates...which is nothing more than an implicit subsidy. And yes, oil gets more than its share too.

2877 2018-02-08 18:13:12 I just have trouble understanding why people buy property around a port and then protest that the port is being used as a port. It is going to take time to develop new economies for all of you that consume our oil.
2878 2018-02-08 18:13:06 Well it won‚Äôt be like this. Oil played well last night tbh. ANOTHER review doesn‚Äôt go their way and lost 3-2 before empty netters.

2886 2018-02-08 18:11:58 The problem is the 2019 1600 scenario does not align with the oil chart. After the 2008 low oil ralied until 2011(or 2013 secondary high), that would mean a market top in 2021 or even 2023.

2888 2018-02-08 18:11:38 He's such a closed-minded idiot. My brother was in a horrific accident last year, and he was able to stop taking the opiate based pain medication because of CBD oil. Non psychotropic CBD oil is bordering on "Miracle Drug."

2910 2018-02-08 18:09:34 The Trump administration does not want to protect ANY wildlife they are systematically releasing animals from protection to cater to the oil companies & trophy hunters people need to be aware they do this quietly so they can slip it thru.

2914 2018-02-08 18:09:01 The build up of forces in Khusham was ongoing for nearly a week.  We had indications of it for quite a while before they actually attacked.  To imply that a build up of forces was just a spontaneous reaction to "ISIS" just plays into the propaganda.  They wanted the oil field.
2915 2018-02-08 18:08:59 Palm oil is terrible too. No one is arguing in favor of it.
2916 2018-02-08 18:08:54 The #USA is now invading #Syria to steal their land and oil. No longer can they use their funded #ISIS militants so now it's just direct attacks

2921 2018-02-08 18:08:24 Shale OIL producers keep shooting themselves and the rest of the oil industry in the foot. Bumping production when their is a glut lowers prices to unsustainable levels. oil companies and the businesses support them fail. That means no hope of energy independence.

2922 2018-02-08 18:08:16 #Oil production hit a record 10.251 million b/d and is 1.273 million b/d higher than last year.
2923 2018-02-08 18:08:15 Saudi is allowing women to drive cars because price if oil is going down?
2924 2018-02-08 18:08:09 Hmm. I think a simpler explanation is, that the #SAA were advancing on the #CONOCO gas plant and the #Jafar oil field.
#ISISDF are in #DeZEast for two reasons:
1. To possess a buffer zone
2. To send all #Syria‚Äôs oil and gas there through #Turkey to the Mediterranean
2925 2018-02-08 18:08:04 Fact of the Day: By 1880, 90% of the US oil market was controlled by John D. Rockefeller. During that time, 40% of all good shipped belonged to Standard Oil.

2931 2018-02-08 18:07:26 PSA: if you have a smelly litter box that you can never get clean no matter what you do, go to Hobby Lobby get some clothes pins and essential oil and soak the pins in the oil. Attach the pins to the air vent and BAM now you won't smell the box. (avoid oils that irritate animals)

2941 2018-02-08 18:06:08 Quick PSA with the glitter cases everyone is talking about. If you buy one at Walmart it contains non toxic mineral oil. So if you really want one but don‚Äôt want to risk it take a quick trip to Walmart and enjoy!
2942 2018-02-08 18:05:47 We seem to be very interested in that oil, and establishing a Kurdish area is a convenient way to get it. :(
2943 2018-02-08 18:05:43 In small southern towns throughout the U.S., families and churches who have relied on oil money for centuries continue to hold a monopoly on politics and wealth. The institutionalized racism embedded in the culture of low-population southern towns oppresses minorities
2944 2018-02-08 18:05:36 While oil refineries are shutting down because of the venture socialist ethanol mandate, the McConnell deal gives more handouts to impotent green energy.

2946 2018-02-08 18:05:28 The do-for-self ideology is a myth. Who is growing their own food, collecting and filtering their own water, harnessing their own electricity, making their own clothes, drilling for their own oil, etc.? Human beings were made to depend on each other.

2952 2018-02-08 18:04:32 Hmmm. Some baloney there. Under the Harper Government, two entirely new oil pipelines were approved and built: The non-XL version of Keystone & the Alberta Clipper. Also the changeover in Line 9 taking oil west to east - an added 1.25-million barrels/day of pipeline capacity.
2953 2018-02-08 18:04:30 So should we continue to support a dictatorial regime because they've given us oil?
2954 2018-02-08 18:04:25 Heres challenge first ABNDP govt ever.Making more progress on environment than any previous gov‚Äôt. Leverage oil $ to fund green energy projects.

2993 2018-02-08 18:01:11 Yes, you're naive. Government subsidizes most everything. The roads you drive on, the clean water you drink. The tasty food you eat. The oil industry is so heavily subsidized by the gov. that w/o it you wouldn't have a job or afford gas. See oil depletion allowance.

2995 2018-02-08 18:01:06 @smccarthy55 Exempting #oilsands in-situ projects from all federal environmental assessment deeply undermines the credibility of this newly review process. It's a prime example of government capture by the oil & gas industry.

3002 2018-02-08 18:00:43 Love what you are doing Jess! Allow me to play the devils advocate. Fossil fuel industry (oil, not coal) doesn't just provide fuel but also the resources for the manufacture of plastics which have thousands of applications. Without oil, what will substitute the plastics?

3015 2018-02-08 17:59:35 Why is it not exporting the max every week? insufficient demand for the crude being offered? it is estimated at least 50% of flow to Asia is medium grades. Just because it draws down does not mean refiners are not using their best Crude oil first while margins are at their best.

A stronger dollar, on track for its biggest weekly rise since November 2016, was adding pressure by making it more profitable for holders of other currencies to sell dollar-denominated assets such as oil, which dropped to $65 a barrell. #ThursdayThoughts
3047 2018-02-08 17:55:24 When someone says "fundamentals are strong" and HODL, that means they have no idea what's going on.  
Remember oil February 2016? "Fundamentals bearish" and oil rallied from 30 to 60...

3052 2018-02-08 17:55:13 Give yourself a daily #abhyanga (#Ayurvedic oil massage).

It is balancing to #Vata #dosha and, because of this, it calms #anxious feelings and stress.
3053 2018-02-08 17:55:13 Plenty.  He had a chance to get bin laden, he went after Saddam instead.  Families did oil business with bin laden dad years before.   Saddam threatened to kill ghwb so Geo went after him instead.

3055 2018-02-08 17:55:00 I've just been applying shea butter, it's basically just a rash right now so it's not like a scar has already formed that I'm trying to rid of. (At least I don't think it has scarred). I've heard that things like shea butter, aloe Vera, jojoba oil, and biotin oil help w scarring!
3056 2018-02-08 17:54:59 I had the same situation. Went for an oil change, and the mechanic said "You should also do something about that flat tire" What an asshole!

3063 2018-02-08 17:54:27 I drove my grandpa to his appointment and he starts complaining about how I didn‚Äôt warm up the car before I took off and asked if I changed the oil (three times) lol how I missed him 
3064 2018-02-08 17:54:20 Obama said a lot of things that were not true....Keep your own doctor...shovel ready jobs. Benghazi was due to a film, Keys Stone pipeline is for oil that bypasses the USA ,His School In Indonesia Was Christian, (He was registered as a Muslim),etc.
3065 2018-02-08 17:54:09 Black pepper improves absorption and bioavailability. Tumeric is poorly absorbed without it. Also add a little olive oil to boost absorption.
3066 2018-02-08 17:54:08 @ryanjespersen Alberta already refines 60% of the oil produced within the province. Keep in mind some customers want to refine their own products as well. Any smart company will have a diverse customer base.

3072 2018-02-08 17:53:49 That‚Äôs why this immigration/DACA thing is so big, Trump really not tryna open the borders to all the Muslims and other people whose lands we basically took up for oil or those we displaced and gave the land to our allied country (i.e Israel)
3073 2018-02-08 17:53:43 I don't get how land locking Alberta oil (and NFLD oil?) helps get the world off Russian and Middle East oil.  How does that work?

3075 2018-02-08 17:53:37 Had a chat with a friend last night, he lives in Calgary. University educated, engineer. Works in the oil patch.

3098 2018-02-08 17:50:59 @carolemacneil None of your pipeline panelists addressed the fact that the BC economy relies HEAVILY on a clean coastline for tourism, fishing, etc. This is NOT just a radical environmental issue. The "world class" oil spill cleanup regime of the Fed's can't clean up RAW BITUMEN.
3099 2018-02-08 17:50:47 Fair enough. Your position is a reasonable one, even though I disagree with it. What about this? If AB can reduce CI on oil sands crudes that displace heavies like Nigerian Brass, for instance, is that not a net climate benefit?

3102 2018-02-08 17:50:09 Maduro, being a trash leader, simply refused to move on from oil export and ran the country into the ground with his reluctance to branch out from oil export.

3104 2018-02-08 17:50:04 WANTED: Someone who knows how to put oil in my car because I have no clue.
3105 2018-02-08 17:49:59 It‚Äôs simple:
- olive oil: 1 tablespoon 
- salt 1/2 teaspoon 
- black pepper: 1/4 teaspoon 
Preheat oven to 400 degrees, cook for about 10min for well done 8-10min .
3106 2018-02-08 17:49:55 My car needs service b from Mercedes tomorrow and I wanna cry. $500 down the drain on a damn oil change and air filter.

3110 2018-02-08 17:49:38 The Government should be ashamed! Deeply so. Depriving children of food, stressing out their parents, will lead to mental health/health problems in later life. I recall FREE orange juice/cod liver oil/milk when I was growing up. @conservatives
3111 2018-02-08 17:49:38 I think that some of the people have to ask themselves, what their lives would be like without petroleum products in it. Consider the various methods of moving the product. Then consider how things will change if Alberta oil isn't going to BC.

3117 2018-02-08 17:48:55 @ryanjespersen Solar & renewables are certainly the future for electricity generation. But in pragmatic terms there is still a need & demand for oil based fuels for many years to come. Anything that contains plastic or polyester uses oil!

3119 2018-02-08 17:48:50 You keep talking about US this and US that. Chavez set up Venezuela's entire economy to resolve around oil and when oil prices plummeted, they suffered a huge backlash as that was their main export.

This has nothing to do with US.

3121 2018-02-08 17:48:47 A point I've been making on air for a long time. No protests, no tanker ban on the St. Lawrence River. Why is that?  Why are Canadians buying foreign oil? Why are exports of Canada's oil being denied. Who is profiting?
3122 2018-02-08 17:48:42 It's a CBC report not reading their bias crap.If the economy is doing well its not because of Trudeau. It has to do with the price of oil. This Liberal govt was given a majority & they sure r taking advantage of it. Some of the bills they r passing r outrageous & dangerous.

3124 2018-02-08 17:48:32 So much happening so fast. #oil pops higher on 5min chart volatility pop when I'm not looking. It won't last, but is now excellent area to enter bearish and suffer the drawdown for a bigger gain later.
3125 2018-02-08 17:48:27 Do you believe in gas after oil ?
3126 2018-02-08 17:48:18 House committee passes $580m revenue bill. Includes newer or higher taxes on fuel, cigarettes, oil and gas production and renewable energy production. Goes to Senate committee this afternoon.
3127 2018-02-08 17:48:18 Yeah most days I go with half (50), but I never take more later in the day as it does mess with my sleep. Fascinating about the super coffee sensitivity.

The only tow things that have improved my sleep quality so far have been reducing coffee and CBD oil.

3132 2018-02-08 17:47:21 And are we going to ignore increased US efforts to isolate Venezuela and how that has been impacting them? Maduro doesn't control oil prices, and US sanctions have contributed to their economy being damaged.
3133 2018-02-08 17:47:16 Not only hot money but also very procyclical structure of economy
But at least one reason of underperformance (during oil slumps) partially goes away
3134 2018-02-08 17:47:01 No, one more wave higher 1st. And in any case the decline won't be even close to Oil's decline in 2008. 20% max.

3136 2018-02-08 17:46:58 Stop taking credit for an oil boom. You didn't take the blame for the bust. Can't have it both ways.
NM must diversify so oil doesn't keep us on a roller coaster.

3137 2018-02-08 17:46:56 Every one of those uses has a better alternative. It is those who profit from oil who pretend there are no options.
3138 2018-02-08 17:46:55 Ooohh yes!  Have you been to @willow_creeksa in @WorcWineRoute ?  Such yummy olive products & I finally found my perfect olive - a green one in rosemary, garlic & olive oil! Taken me many years but I found it  #TravelChatSA
3139 2018-02-08 17:46:54 Nigeria really needs to take climate change seriously. There is no other logical explanation for the current heat wave. Excess gas flaring by oil companies is having grave impact on the environment and this is just the beginning.
3140 2018-02-08 17:46:54 Part of the big club that includes a lot of dems. And republicans.  All his oil buddies that helped him get into office were paid back.  Remember the last 6 months he was in office and gas went up over 5 dollars a gallon. Crooks are who is bashing Trump

3142 2018-02-08 17:46:39 PSA: if you've got a community popcorn popper in your office, don't use coconut oil in it to pop kernels! coconut is a common allergen (i know at least 2 friends allergic) and if they're not aware they could have a reaction!
3143 2018-02-08 17:46:27 That hyaluronic acid would do you great too. Since you are oily, I don‚Äôt want to suggest an oil, and I haven‚Äôt released my oily skin moisturizer yet but till then I suggest neutrogena hydroboost gel.
3144 2018-02-08 17:46:27 My car keeps stalling while driving and they basically say ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt find an issue, that‚Äôll be $150‚Äù and they raised the oil change price from $40 to $72  @Ford all the vehicles I‚Äôve ever owned have been ford but this is seriously dangerous and nothing is being done
3145 2018-02-08 17:46:22 Why did people think cars were a good thing? I come in for an oil change and am leaving with knowledge that like 100s of dollars of work needs to be done to my car. Neat. Super fun.
3146 2018-02-08 17:46:21 Only Oil shares :-)
3147 2018-02-08 17:46:07 And people think quitting smoking is hard!

Even if the electric car was perfected today and everyone miraculously found one in their driveway tomorrow, we'd still need oil for a long time to come.
3148 2018-02-08 17:46:01 Reuters- Venezuela's PDVSA has bought 1.73 mln bbl of US crude, 1.44 mln bbl of Russian oil for Curacao refinery since Dec by swapping its own barrels #OOTT

3153 2018-02-08 17:45:31 Because the ‚ÄúBlackDeath‚Äù called oil was discovered...and countries that live out of it and corps that thrive on it have 0 interest to cut the branch on which they are all enriching themselves..sadly oil was found on Only very few ‚ÄúEthical‚Äù places...end of oil era will be
3154 2018-02-08 17:45:26 The authors have not made even the minimal effort to understand that these idiots use a type of oil (NOT a steroid) to inflate and deform themselves.
3155 2018-02-08 17:45:19 First we give its people hypertension and diabetes and when they are too sick to fight back, we move in for the oil. Way to play the long game America.
3156 2018-02-08 17:44:50 This expresses a combination of better base cost of production, and less focus on production at any cost.  Big oil is learning to make money from oil, not oil from money.
3157 2018-02-08 17:44:45 Got a mailer from Gov Susana yesterday, taking credit for NM going from budget shortfall to $300M surplus w/o raising taxes. Tax thing mostly true, but no credit for the surplus. Oil prices picked up so oil cos are doing more drilling so we get more $ from them. We're not stupid.

3160 2018-02-08 17:44:18 We already have enough oil in our reserves to cook the planet five times over. We can't burn what we have. Drilling for more is unconscionable. As Carbon Tracker says, we are rapidly transitioning to a clean energy economy. @KQEDForum
3161 2018-02-08 17:44:00 #cdnpoli #abpoli #bcpoli Does this include the regulation of East coast oil tankers so as to not polute the grand banks? Are you for the  Energy East Pipeline reducing the need for foreign oil delivered by Tanker?
3162 2018-02-08 17:43:54 An EPA Chief who sees global warming as a positive; a secretary of interior selling off sacred & protected land to oil companies; an attorney general in on the take but concerns himself with Marijuana; a secretary of education who has contempt for public education; it goes on
3163 2018-02-08 17:43:46 Maybe they should figure out how to not add to our already massive debt. Can‚Äôt go on forever. Oil companies & most of the other large corps don‚Äôt need tax cuts. Small business yes.
3164 2018-02-08 17:43:45 Right... but its impossible to meet #ParisAgreement targets while expanding the #tarsands   Its the dirtiest oil on the planet. Your own agencies say Canada is not meeting its commitments. #cdnpoli #bcpoli

3205 2018-02-08 17:40:46 Tillerson like pretty much all of Trump's nominees should never have been confirmed.  He wants Russia in here as much as Trump does if not more.  Exxon oil will make both of them and Putin millions.

I don't like pipelines and I don't like our continuous dependency on oil. However, we have reality to contend with & I think Notley is striking the right blame.
3213 2018-02-08 17:40:13 I knew there was a reason I put my CBD oil in my purse today.
3214 2018-02-08 17:40:11 CBD oil has been a miracle for me, but I'm not going to tell people to ditch their needed meds for it. It's not a miracle cure. Different bodies need different treatments.

3221 2018-02-08 17:39:38 Faster yet more dangerous to BC environment. Albertans get a yearly payout per person for oil. Give BC people same yearly payout per person
3222 2018-02-08 17:39:25 Alberta will never have a low net unit or per capita CI, ever, until the global energy system electrifies and stops using oil. The Notley govt has an ambitious climate plan that begins reducing emissions and I support the CLP.

3240 2018-02-08 17:37:49 Wow. Trump is coming to ca to promote oil drilling off the cost of ca and they've already estimated 700 oil spills in the pacific which is over 4 million gallons of oil.

3254 2018-02-08 17:36:20 I take issue with the lack of respect for native sovereignty. Only 1 nation is for the pipeline. 

Pipeline is not going to make oil sands more profitable. It will always be held hostage by OPEC. Extraction is far too costly

It will only create 6 permanent jobs. 6.

3379 2018-02-08 17:22:45 I think my stance is known already on the BC/Alberta thing, but I'll still say this.

1) Even if it was refined oil instead DilBit in the KM pipeline, most of people protesting would still hate it, & would protest refineries getting built.
2) Canadian enviro laws are way stricter

3416 2018-02-08 17:19:44 The oil industry is full of instances where companies have build projects that leave the industry with over capacity. It is what makes it cyclical. The whole industry works on over and under capacity. People not battering down the door for the crude at moment.

3422 2018-02-08 17:18:56 Capsaicinoids are only mildly soluble in water, but are much more soluble in fats.  

So skim milk is worthless (aside from the caseins), whole is ok, half and half is better, heavy cream (or even olive oil) is best.

3424 2018-02-08 17:18:49 What happens when an oil company well off-shore horizontally drills into an oil field that requires a state permit? They‚Äôll just take the oil and if caught pay a fine-maybe.
3425 2018-02-08 17:18:46 Remember that drilling can be directed horizontally as well as vertically. If you have enough pipe work your rig out with Irish waters could sook out Irish oil.

3515 2018-02-08 17:08:54 Keith Davey Liberal strategist under senior trudope said ‚ÄúScrew the West, we‚Äôll take the Rest.‚Äù That was during 1980 election. They wanted to control Alberta Oil and sell it to the East for a lower price.
3516 2018-02-08 17:08:48 That is true but #Suncor is still doing a way better job at trying to preserve and restore the environment than other oil companies from around the world.

3518 2018-02-08 17:08:36 Yes I have,,after indy WM will lose 92% of our oil and gas revenue and scots will gain that 92%,,so yer wee transfer is no problem.

3531 2018-02-08 17:06:32 Scott,do you not find it odd that WM would pay 10BN for scots with no gain for WM?..

3556 2018-02-08 17:03:40 Mar 2016 to July 2016, short interest increased 25% but oil prices still rose from ~37$/bbl (Mar 2016) to ~45 $/bbl (Jul 2016). While this can be a good indicator (as in 2017) not all years are the same and fundamentals can still move prices beyond positioning.

3617 2018-02-08 16:59:05 As I see it, the U.S. funders of Anti-pipeline Activism have four main goals: 

1) More renewable energy
2) Better energy efficiency
3) Energy independence/security
4) Controlling Canadian oil

We can agree on 1, 2 & 3. 
We should work hard on that & 
put our foot down about #4.

3620 2018-02-08 16:58:35 No abusers do. It's part of the pathology of abusers & why it it so so difficult to treat the regardless of job.... be it a high ranking WhiteHouse job or the guy changing the oil in your car at local garage.
3621 2018-02-08 16:58:22 The last batch I made with coconut oil. Bad idea. Don't use that. It's much better with almond oil. I just put it in the mixer like I'm making a cake and put in oils and a little water till I get a good butter consistency
3622 2018-02-08 16:58:20 MSM: Someone needs to run an in depth story looking at all the climate change denial research and it's funding ties to big oil. Then clear up the ambiguity the media created by running it over and over again.

3626 2018-02-08 16:57:11 Congress just gifted Exxon with a $6 billion windfall from the tax bill. Now, days later, people are trying to sneak 45Q - *another* handout to oil companies - into the spending bill? 

This is disgraceful. #Stop45Q #StopFundingFossils @RepRichardNeal
3627 2018-02-08 16:57:11 i think so, because using moisturizers can help prevent fine lines. But for those with oily skin, I like to recommend something very light, which doesn't add extra oil, like  @SkinCeuticals B5 Hydrating Gel :)
3628 2018-02-08 16:57:01 This plan will not end with Russia easing Assad from power. It does establish a policy that denies Damascus much of Syria's oil, water and agricultural resources to keep the country poor, weak and divided. This will help Israel/KSA and hurt Iran/RU. Gives it human rights fig leaf

Foreign owned oil companies sending oil to foreign destinations through sensitive waters was not the right decision by the feds and needs to be re-looked at.

3722 2018-02-08 16:44:44 This plan will not end with Russia easing Assad from power. It does establish a policy that denies Damascus much of Syria's oil, water and agricultural resources to keep the country poor, weak and divided. This will help Israel/KSA and hurt Iran/RU

3724 2018-02-08 16:44:39 So currently there are 250 cargo ships going in and out per month, of which 4 are oil tankers, and the KM expansion would increase these numbers to 274 cargo ships per month, of which 28 would be oil tankers? Is my math correct?
3725 2018-02-08 16:44:37 Are you nuts? Where are you getting your figures? Pre-crude oil era leading up to 1960, palm oil contributed up to 82% of national export revenue with Cocoa almost at par Groundnut oil for which the North was known is not even remotely close to being as valuable. Fakestats#

3730 2018-02-08 16:43:56 Why would that be perverse? Global oil consumption is forecast to rise from 98.6MM b/d now to 115MM b/d by 2040. Someone is going to supply that oil. Why not Alberta, which is working hard to bring down the carbon-intensity of its crude, unlike other producing nations?

3834 2018-02-08 16:33:27 Global equities extend losses. Dow accelerates drop, falling 450 pts, lower in 3 of 4 past sessions, now about 2000 pts below highest level on January 26. Financial leads sell off. Oil continues to slide, @$61. Yield of 10 yr treasury near 2.9%

Bahamians. You cook the curry in oil with seasonings before you put the meat in the pan. DO NOT SEASON THE MEAT WITH CURRY AND THEN COOK IT
3836 2018-02-08 16:33:24 What I noticed that even if I don't remember something exactly, I have a gut feeling that tells something is off, like with chemistry.

I know people who've thrown water on an oil fire even though both school physics and usually your own fucking mother explicitly tell you not to.

3839 2018-02-08 16:33:07 Yes but that isn‚Äôt the argument she stated coconut oil is full of cholesterol which it isn‚Äôt. Yes its bad for cholesterol levels but I never said otherwise did I? Just pointing out there is a difference and that particular statement is incorrect. I am not promoting coconut oil.
3840 2018-02-08 16:33:01 Ok. I baked them but i dont think i uaed enough seasoning and olive oil.

3845 2018-02-08 16:32:44 If I look into the future I see a dollar falling as money flows out from the US; economic acceleration; increasing inflation globally and tightening Mon Pol (not only in the US which is relatively priced in). This translates into higher commodity prices in general (oil included)
3846 2018-02-08 16:32:38 Dylan voluntarily brought my car to get an oil change and tires rotated just because he knew I had a lot to do today, the little things really mean the most
3847 2018-02-08 16:32:32 "Aadhaar center asked him to apply coconut oil for four days and try his luck"

Makes me almost irresistibly want to apply coconut oil to a nice, long stick and try my luck with the UIDAI CEO.

3867 2018-02-08 16:30:46 I never said I agreed with decision to go to war, it was all about the oil and probably still is.  Is there ever a good reason to go to war No. In relation to George W cheering me up I was referring to the time he said 'some day I hope humans and fish can co-exist peacefully'
3868 2018-02-08 16:30:42 @marcuslemonis would like to see you turn the tire repair/oil change business model and customer experience upside down. Seems ripe for a better process! What‚Äôs worse?
3869 2018-02-08 16:30:39 Kinder Morgan will pull out if it is changed. Sooo many big companies are leaving because of the monies they have spent only to be denied. Finally it has been approved and a few people don‚Äôt want it. We should shut off ALL oil and gas to BC. See how you like it.

3882 2018-02-08 16:29:53 It only benefits Alberta. When the @CPC_HQ was in power they tried to base the Canadian economy on oil and when world prices tumbled, Canada suffered the consequences. Alberta is also suffering the same fate. They need to diversify away from oil. #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM

Only way I‚Äôd reconsider that stance is if Trump or Mattis came out and clearly stated what our full purpose is in being there. 
‚ÄúGetting the oil‚Äù? 
‚ÄúJust fighting ISIS‚Äù?
‚ÄúTaking over land‚Äù? 
At least it‚Äôd be upfront

3925 2018-02-08 16:24:46 Note to the wise & also myself-watch all of @JessicaVosk's Instagram story before applying thieves & Neosporin. Neosporin is NOT a carrier oil.

3940 2018-02-08 16:23:30 1st, CO2 ia NOT pollution. You breathe it out at 40,000 ppm. 2nd, name a replacement for oil. 3rd, any barrel of oil not from Canada comes from another country. Who do you support?
3941 2018-02-08 16:23:27 That's not true. We are constantly introducing new technology that allows us to produce far more oil while lowering emissions. CO2 is an Alberta Advantage that allows us to go from 173 Billion barrels recoverable to well over 1 Trillion! Isn't that great news?

3960 2018-02-08 16:21:39 Think about a drink like "butterbeer" if you've heard it, same concept it's frothy on top. I add cinnamon and coconut oil. You can always add any flavor. It does help with my energy. I'm also on the keto diet so it's the only coffee I can have other than starbucks coldbrew

3973 2018-02-08 16:20:28 Any beard oil you'd recommend in particular? My husband @TheRealQuatrol has beautiful chin locks and we've been wondering about styling products.
3974 2018-02-08 16:20:27 That strike was on Syrian Army and Iranian Back militias who were trying to advance to the oil fields north of the Euphrates that is being held by US back SDF/YGP forces. There a sort of understanding that the territory past the Euphrates belongs to the US area of influence
3975 2018-02-08 16:20:19 It seems like that's the only way we stop getting pushed around. Everyone wants to dump on our oil industry but also have their hands out to collect the money and benefits. It's frustrating
3976 2018-02-08 16:20:14 Possibly sentiment and stretched positioning
But fundamentals? on a y/y basis, inventories are way below last 2017 levels. Cushing inventories collapsing (at this pace Cushing will be empty in months); US refinery demand above 5-year range; Chinese oil imports at all-time highs..
3977 2018-02-08 16:19:55 It's easy to say, "Oh those BC jerks sure don't complain about getting money from oil!" but that's simply ignoring the concerns. The current plan doesn't work for a lot of BC residents. Their opinions are less important than those of Albertans?
3978 2018-02-08 16:19:51 Then why are you allowing oil companies to jeopardize our ‚Äúshining shores‚Äù and  pipelines to pollute our national lands?  Americans would like their children to also enjoy this splendor.

3984 2018-02-08 16:19:01 KM currently transports 300,000 barrels of oil each day, the new parallel pipeline would transport up to 890,000 barrels of oil, tripling current capacity. The increase in oil would lead to an increase in tanker traffic along the BC coast from 5 tankers per month to 34.
3985 2018-02-08 16:18:53 The original pipeline was constructed in 1953 and purchased by #KinderMorgan Canada in 2005. It was designed to carry conventional crude oil but recently has been carrying the heavy oil, diluted bitumen (dilbit), from the Alberta tar sands to tankers in Vancouver harbour.

4076 2018-02-08 16:09:09 @albertaNDP @RachelNotley Whose interests are you really defending? The people of Alberta's or wealthy oil companies who aren't even paying their fair share to your coffers? People > profits.
4077 2018-02-08 16:09:04 Many Rs I know (personally) are business owners. Their money is their priority. They admit that. Sure, they like Nat. Parks, but have no problem with the gov. exploiting this land for monetary gain. (Mining, oil,etc). Fond of bashing the indigenous in our area.
4078 2018-02-08 16:08:32 One caveat to this: dow / oil / gold slides further, money rotates into $BTC / commodities as a hedge
4079 2018-02-08 16:08:20 "There is need for domestic energy security to avoid crises in the next decade. Factors responsible for this include oil prices, electronic vehicles, influence of OPEC, changing energy mix and investment in renewable energy by IOCs  which would replace fossil fuel in  future".

4083 2018-02-08 16:07:51 There is no Western plan to change the route only your plan. Trans mountain has been approved. If the tree huggers don‚Äôt like it we need to shut the existing gas and oil to BC.
4084 2018-02-08 16:07:47 There's plenty of oil in the U.S. To be energy independent. However Canada has no refining ability and must import.

Most makes and models!
4091 2018-02-08 16:06:52 It‚Äôs just cannabis oil, C60, turmeric, and black pepper.
4092 2018-02-08 16:06:43 man forreal they gmfu, ima just do the oil and filter change and the brakes that‚Äôs it 
4093 2018-02-08 16:06:42 And this is why Lucas oil is taking over dirt racing . Very stupid move on the Woo's behalf .
4094 2018-02-08 16:06:38 The magic eye was dirty,  so it wouldn't fire.
Going again  
They thought they had an oil leak. 
What a spec of dirt can cause

4099 2018-02-08 16:06:09 Having worked in various oil sands operations for 20+ years, I can tell you with full confidence that Alberta's lax requirements for land reclamation will result in the largest scars on earth when these operations wind down, from Kearl on down to Suncor.
4100 2018-02-08 16:06:08 
4101 2018-02-08 16:06:07 Because it is DOW tracking.  It isn't a crude fundamentals sell off, it is an oil correlation to the DOW.  Yes, the shorts are seeing confirming price action, but, so far, they are confusing their thesis as the root of the drop, with the DOW, which IS the root of the drop.
4102 2018-02-08 16:05:58 @cecilhaire the price of energy will be going up in the near future is guaranteed. How else will Montreal be able to pay for their heated sidewalks that the Mayor is proposing? I have a wood and oil furnace buddy.
4103 2018-02-08 16:05:57 I mean areas such as oil refining, electricity generation and distribution, and food processing
4104 2018-02-08 16:05:54 We need to shut the existing oil and gas being piped to BC.

4115 2018-02-08 16:04:17 also yesterday @ScarlettSageX and I covered ourselves in so much coconut oil we were more coconut oil than girls that like girls and it was beyond epic
4116 2018-02-08 16:04:17 My question is, with all this US oil, why have gas prices gone up so much in Oregon? Gone up $1.00 per gallon since Trump took office! That $1.50 an hour  tax it almost pays for the fuel increase!
4117 2018-02-08 16:04:10 We would need to actually own the oil. Instead most of the companies extracting it aren't Canadian.

4312 2018-02-08 15:41:43 Coconut oil is a good option. You also want to apply it night because it will break down your make up just like the oils in your skin do. Do you use a primer?

4333 2018-02-08 15:39:43 Alberta doesn‚Äôt only produce dilbit. There are many grades of Oil produced in the province. Depending on who buys the pipeline space it could transport all conventional oil. It still baffles me that you‚Äôre fine with it coming in on Truck and Rail which it already is.

I like the idea of Faulk being brought in and canes have lots of young highly drafted D. So they might be willing to let someone go.

But I don't think Drai can anchor a line. If he was capable wouldn't a thin team like the oil have him doing so already?
4343 2018-02-08 15:39:14 @kloskemk2013 I think that Ida Tarbell had the biggest impact because she was one of the first people to help break monopolies. She investigated the problems with standard oil, she wrote the McClure‚Äôs magazines, worked from 1900 to 1912.
4344 2018-02-08 15:38:43 Dear @tulsaworld, will you compare exactly what taxes wind vs. oil & gas are paying, and what subsidies each industry is enjoying in #Oklahoma. So much misinformation seems to be swirling around the @StepUpOklahoma campaign. It would be a timely service to your readers.

4363 2018-02-08 15:37:02 ah, so the bidders are assuming oil won't be much more expensive in three years - which seems reasonable considering the recent report on record US crude production
4364 2018-02-08 15:37:00 Any solution is going to require some fossil fuels. Given that, a natural gas terminal makes sense and shouldn't be lumped together with coal and the toxic fuel oil that is currently being used.

4417 2018-02-08 15:31:58 Do you remember that time the Syrians had to give you a little bit of a boot up the bum so you would cross the Khobar & liberate those oil fields.

It'd be a shame if you did all that dying just to hand them to Erdogan.

4421 2018-02-08 15:31:33 At least the oil is well protected and liberated. God forbid the oil falls into the hands of its real owners.

4424 2018-02-08 15:31:03 There's an old scam in the resources business called "artificial scarcity". If I can convince people that the supply of something is limited, I can charge more for it. The classic example is diamonds.  The world is swimming in oil. Not only that, but it may actually be abiotic
4425 2018-02-08 15:30:54 Surely this is illegal. That reptile has been trotting the globe and undermining democracies with his snake oil money since his Hitler days. Gina miller and he need investigating. Any briefs about?

4473 2018-02-08 15:29:17 As a BC resident I disagree with you. Many residents from the East Kootenay travel to Alberta & northern BC to work in the oil industrial. We are a resource based province but activists will continue to destroy our economy while paying for oil from US, Venezuela, etc.

4514 2018-02-08 15:25:31 Consumers should then cut down on carbon use due to increased price. Oil companies should also cut down on carbon overburden to try try to be more competitive.

4538 2018-02-08 15:22:46 Alberta's options are limited. We can't cut off BC's oil supply, that's illegal (oil companies, for example, have a right to sell their oil under contracts already in place).

4540 2018-02-08 15:22:41 Fossil carbon deposits are so numerous that there's no danger of running out of oil, coal, or natural gas. What we are running out of is the ability to deal with the consequences of burning so many fossil fuels.

4546 2018-02-08 15:21:59 I hope you become premier in 2019 and first priority should be: 
1. Repeal Carbon Tax
2. Limit oil shipments to BC
3. Hold referandum on transfer payments
4. Show Canada that Alberta will no longer be taken for granted. 

Accomplish these you will be a great premier.

4643 2018-02-08 15:13:19 Lady, have you been to Alberta? There's nothing ruined here, except for the economy. Meanwhile, keep buying oil from the US and Middle East. Where nobody cares about the environment at all. 
That said, BC pumps more raw sewage into waterways than any other province. Hypocrites.
4644 2018-02-08 15:13:12 It is still a net importer of oil. Importing close to 6 million barrels a day. These exports are not net exports.

4745 2018-02-08 15:02:58 I am not claiming it‚Äôs good for you. Oil in general tends to be bad. There‚Äôs a difference between something full of cholesterol like you claimed and bad for cholesterol. The original point was about products ‚Äúfull of cholesterol.‚Äù That‚Äôs all. 
4746 2018-02-08 15:02:51 It is getting more obvious all the time. Alberta must refine our own oil and sell it at a premium just like OPEC and the U.S.

4960 2018-02-08 14:37:47 Someone needs to invent a machine that absorbs the carbon and then presses it into diamonds or oil.  Maybe then people will care. (Sarcastic due to concern that we are long past the tipping point and nothing has really changed in behaviour or expectations).

5450 2018-02-08 13:47:10 We need to move more green, as users. But the problem is - oil is the retail product. It is being sold as the major export and generate revenue. I have seen American interference so the flow goes south, at a cheaper price. There is more going on than we realize.

5508 2018-02-08 13:41:37 This is why when you have a subject like climate change....asking an oil man who has no science background, and who has fought the very institution he now runs....you will get this kind of dangerous and reckless rhetoric. #ClimateChangeIsReal

5509 2018-02-08 13:41:30 Oil price collapse, which just started reduces inflation for a brief period with a lag. However, the summer run up in oil will accelerate inflation. Some say Brent $90. Therefore a new High coming, SPY, it could be a higher or lower high.

5602 2018-02-08 13:28:35 They never bothered about Pass Pricing. Even Pakistan did a far better job in passing the benefits to its people when oil prices fell.

At least if Modi had asked Nawaz Shariff about this during the surgical visit, people of India should have got some benefits.

5612 2018-02-08 13:27:17 How could I forget, when (~4,5%) dividend is all I get? Frankly, I would expect more. Late positive developments is a reminder that cost discipline, capex restraint and increased debt (and oil price increase) is good for STL shareholder returns.

5619 2018-02-08 13:26:24 Wrong.The fed targeting inflation for the first time during Reagan years is what made the economy recover.Jimmy carter added 10 million jobs in 4 years with high tax rates and during the effects of the oil embargo. There is no correlation between tax cuts and economic growth.

5640 2018-02-08 13:22:35 the fluctuating price of oil is the whole point of the Alaska permanent fund. oil revenue has been paid into it, and now there's a fund paying dividends intended to outlast the oil.
5641 2018-02-08 13:22:14 How much data was he giving out when he was the FM? None of it actually. Simply fooling people! Policy decisions are undertaken when you come to the bridge.

5661 2018-02-08 13:19:58 Guy on BNN was raving about $CNQ just yesterday. My bone to pick with them is their double-down on the oil sands a year or so ago. And they're all about Alberta natural gas. Either really stupid, or really brilliant. No middle road here.  :)
5662 2018-02-08 13:19:53 One motive. Iraq had enough gold to start a world Bank. As did Libya. Where is it? Follow the gold. And the money. And the priceless artifacts.

5663 2018-02-08 13:19:49 Dianne, make California its own country!  Then you can control its borders as well as 200 miles of offshore drilling.  Import all the oil you want for the 39 million people before the exodus.  Desalination will have to be improved to cover the loss of the Colorado River.

mama: uy, lagyan mo nga ng label to. napahid ko sa mukha ko eh. Naglagay pala ako ng efficascent oil dito.
5721 2018-02-08 13:12:07 You said that we wanted Syria's oil. That is ludicrous. You sound like a low skilled propagandist.

5736 2018-02-08 13:08:40 ... is that a joke? Green energy is the most expensive energy on Earth and you'd need a ridiculous amount of it to heat your home. Gas isn't clean. Oil isn't clean.

5765 2018-02-08 13:04:08 No. *headdesk* For a start the oil sector is costing money at the moment. It‚Äôs also not a reliable or green income stream for future.
And we *do* get the profits (if there were any), we get a fiscal transfer. We get more back at the moment in fact than we put in.

5768 2018-02-08 13:03:25 Only criticism is that no self-respecting Greek would leave a Greek salad so naked! It has to have enough oil and vinegar for a Greek to dip his/her bread in! If not, it gets sent back to the kitchen. Olive oil is healthy for you and keeps your bowels lubed!

5841 2018-02-08 12:54:53 Nigeria & overdoing things.

Crude Oil - Nigeria destroys ecosystem, kills biodiversity, ruins aquatic life & renders people homeless, jobless & poor health.

Cow - No where close to the highest producers of beef in the world, but humans die every day because of cows.

5853 2018-02-08 12:53:35 Aside the fact of owing salaries, what would fund this increase in salaries? Tax? A new revenue source? Volatile oil price increase? People should ask questions instead of swallowing "good news" hook, line and sinker.

5944 2018-02-08 12:39:03 @permabear_uk nice call on twitter. Wish i had kept mine! Do you think it‚Äôs time to sell $rig? Oil stocks hit hard, and oil only has moved down a little. If oil keeps going down, wouldn‚Äôt these get hit worse? Thx
5945 2018-02-08 12:38:59 The U S has more oil than Saudi Arabia! A recently discovered Gulf of Mexico gas find has more BTU than all of Saudi Arabia. Mankind has barely scratched the World's Hydrocarbon Reserves. You should try to become better informed.
5946 2018-02-08 12:38:55 Then the chemicals are drained, just like the oil would be for an oil change. As a matter of fact, an engine flush is often performed after the old oil is taken out and before the new, clean oil is poured in.

5955 2018-02-08 12:37:18 Completely incorrect. China is currently the number one producer of clean coal.  As for oil,  all you have to do is look to the middle east to find a LARGE number of nations producing much more oil than we are.  And there's no such thing as clean oil or coal.

6009 2018-02-08 12:28:56 While I understand what you're saying and how this could benefit the oil companies (which I am against) by the cost of solar panels being raised to compensate for the lost gross margin, ultimately, as it is in capitalism, the decision is in the hands of the consumer (1/2).

6239 2018-02-08 11:49:17 ..definitely cheap & would potentially be a good long time hold after things settle down. However, if you think that significantly higher oil prices aren't possible, then Russia is probably cheap for a reason. For me, low valuation isn't a catalyst, growth is the catalyst

6241 2018-02-08 11:48:55 One problem w/ CAPE is that it's backwards looking. So w/ Russia, it's going to include 4-5 years of high oil prices, which greatly benefitted their economy.

6242 2018-02-08 11:48:43 We're not supposed to pay attention to that, and yet AlGore, the pope of global warming, routinely used that very claim (they're being paid by big oil) to ignore contrary data and make ad hominem attacks against the scientists presenting it.

6727 2018-02-08 10:18:58 We chose automatic fuel adjustment so can't complain. What caused the problem is the introduction of the special petroleum levy which deprived us of enjoying low fuel prices when crude oil was $28. A one-time opportunity which might never come again....

6736 2018-02-08 10:17:15 Definitely shut them all the pipelines down.  We can start by capping oil exports at current levels, then start reducing until exports are zero. In the end, we can extract what we need for Canada instead of destroying swaths of Canada for the benefit of foreign corporations.

7011 2018-02-08 09:21:32 Don't worry about my PhD...Assad refused reforms then continuously killed his own people...then invited sectarian militias to kill in the name of ahlbayt then sold oil to ISIS to strengthen them against rebels and discredit the blessed revolution.

Spills are rare and, truthfully, they clean up quickly in saltwater.  Crude oil dissipates very quickly in  salt water.

3. Pour in oil & stir.
4. Now, get the oil back in the can.

7555 2018-02-08 07:45:09 From a salary standpoint that would be a no-brainer but not so much for the roster...especially if he's used inside the top six.
7556 2018-02-08 07:44:48 I strongly believe it's construction and effort from current team.

I see #PMG increased its position in Perth & Dolphin North Sea Oil Fields from 60.05% to 100% & #ACP delivered its updated resource which was as I expected an increase & of 25% 
7561 2018-02-08 07:43:25 And that's the key isn't. The ask on many of these guys wasn't realistic. The sheer volume of people saying they should trade Benning is mindboggling.

7564 2018-02-08 07:42:42 I very much question the effort of the forwards, though. Effort was a major problem in the first period, which set the game back. Second period was outstanding.
7565 2018-02-08 07:42:34 while our Sholes in the WH and EPA, DOE deny the need for renewables since they are beholden to the oil lobby....beyond DISGUSTING !!
7566 2018-02-08 07:42:31 Moreover, US and Middle east would further increase production in anticipation of future lower demand in india (so that these countries would nt have to sell their oil in future at lowest price) because of india agressively pursuing policy on electric vehicles. Thats my view.

7569 2018-02-08 07:42:02 I don't think you are addressing oil as the strong addictive that it is. You are applying reason, which rarely works when dealing with addiction.
7570 2018-02-08 07:41:36 Last season was clearly an outlier.  I think if Maroon were to take 2 mill or 2.5 I would keep him him, but that's not going to happen.
7571 2018-02-08 07:41:31 For sure and those are teams that have better rosters. Which brings us back to that construction thing ;)

7583 2018-02-08 07:39:12 Which furthers my point. In order for him to be effective, he needs to score at least year's clip & that S% isn't sustainable. Just like Eberle's was low last season & returned to his usual norms this season. If he doesn't score, the seasons are not the same.

7607 2018-02-08 07:34:43 Thanks. Just wanted to make sure. Natural disasters, population displacement and water (not oil, as some futurists used to predict) shortages (cf, Cape Town) are going to get worse. Too many people still think it's just about "warmer temperatures" - this needs to change.
7608 2018-02-08 07:34:42 100% but the same applies to the Kings this evening. Give them credit for taking the game to the Oilers early on, as they also needed these two points.

7633 2018-02-08 07:30:40 While I am sure they gained some confidence from that one game, at the end of the day they are where they are in the standings and that will have a far greater impact on a team's belief than one game. Just my two cents.

7651 2018-02-08 07:27:30 Inflation is contained because of global prospects like low crude oil prices. Congress faced a deep recession. Don't brush that aside but still kept GDP to the mark. This govt after getting such burgeoning economy paralyzed it by scrapping notes which later proved catastrophic..

7656 2018-02-08 07:27:04 That's not uncommon for a team coming off the run they had. Problem being, they realized they needed to be better but also figured out they weren't good enough. That's a lot to process for any team.

7683 2018-02-08 07:23:42 Whereas Vegas is at the opposite end of the spectrum, confidence and belief are sky high. Also, to be fair, Vegas arguably has the best depth in the league but lacks the high-end talent most teams have. It's a weird combo but it's all working for the Golden Knights.
7684 2018-02-08 07:23:37 I respectfully disagree to some extent. Right from game 2, this team has felt like a team that just expected things to go right, rather than making things happen.

7688 2018-02-08 07:22:18 Agree with the positioning and the high likelihood of a pullback, but against a basket of currencies, oil has gone up significantly as well. Not a weak dollar trade in my opinion.
7689 2018-02-08 07:22:15 In Vegas, I see a team playing hard each and every night, every shift. They play like they have something to prove.
The Oilers don't show that drive. Too much stick waving, fly bys, and non-committed play

7765 2018-02-08 07:12:40 It felt sloppy by the Oilers to me, and like they were reacting to the Kings rather than setting a pace, like they did in the second. Better than the first, for sure, but still chasing. That's been a consistent trend, unfortunately.

7785 2018-02-08 07:09:07 Sure. But I can't use a bad penalty taken by an Oiler as a way to explain the Kings increased numbers.  Those chances are created by a bad penalty, unfortunately.

7796 2018-02-08 07:06:44 Kings had an 11-6 scoring chance advantage in the third, and 3 of the Oiler chances happened on one 3 second flurry near the start of the period.  I just don't buy that as even.

But yeah, agree to disagree. No point twitter fighting!
7797 2018-02-08 07:06:41 So what happens if I‚Äôm driving my car and it runs out of oil

7801 2018-02-08 07:06:08 As a player and contract notwithstanding, Lucic is better IMO. Hall is only a good memory now, best of luck with that. LOL

7804 2018-02-08 07:05:50 Maybe that 3rd period didn't seem so lopsided to me cos 97s line played a ton and to your point the Oil are a one line team that's for sure
7805 2018-02-08 07:05:41 No......  point is that, once an industrial project passes all existing approval processes,  it can/should not be unreasonable held up by post facto silliness.... see previous references to Rotterdam, 70 years of impeccable Vancouver oil shipment etc etc.

7810 2018-02-08 07:05:20 Which truth is bitter. PM Modi speaks only lies. Mr. Pradhan should worry about the oil price rise. Being in the government, the BJP is behaving like opposition and doing theatrics. A few months left, therefore, the BJP becoming restless.
7811 2018-02-08 07:05:14 So Kings had 11 scoring chances, Oilers 6. And 3 of the Oiler chances came in one flurry of 3 seconds, a couple minutes in. That leaves 3 actual chances over the last 16+ minutes. (If I'm reading that correctly).
7812 2018-02-08 07:05:05 .@RachelNotley can be any more petty? this is embarrassing. How can you mix wine and oil? The kinder-morgan pipeline could have a devastating environmental impact to the BC coastline - wine does not. #Alberta #Wine #BC #Oil #Kindermorgan #BCWineChat #RachelNotley #JonHorgan
7813 2018-02-08 07:04:51 Agree to disagree i guess  difference in an even played  3rd was the Kings capitalized on 1 of their few chances and the oilers didn't imo.
7814 2018-02-08 07:04:46 Why are we talking about pipelines? Because oil consumption continues to grow, with no end in sight. You did ask....apologies if actual facts ruin your narrative.

7817 2018-02-08 07:04:24 We will agree to disagree then. Lucic is no burner, but skates much better and has had a way better career than Maroon will ever have. I wish him well wherever he goes.

7854 2018-02-08 06:58:57 Empty net or not, still 3-0 while shots against were doubled. While 3rd wasn't as bad as the first, it still wasn't good enough by far.  How many chances happened without 97 on the ice in the 3rd? Maybe 1?
7855 2018-02-08 06:58:31 "the federal goals of oil sands expansion and meeting our climate commitments are in conflict."
Exactly. And yet PM @JustinTrudeau continues to deny that very obvious fact. That he does so insults our intelligence.

7857 2018-02-08 06:58:14 Late PP and two empty net goals contributed vastly to the shot differential.

7861 2018-02-08 06:57:31 Nice analysis, there are alot more benefits to a stronger exchange rate than a weak one. A stronger rand paralleled with contracting crude oil prices imply a decline in PP index consequently CPI. The outlook is good

7868 2018-02-08 06:56:59 He is a UFA and will be overpaid as most UFA's are. 3yrs 3.5 isn't going to do it. Plus we have a similar player in Lucic who has a no trade clause. He is a goner, no doubt.
7869 2018-02-08 06:56:54 "Entering 2018, Maersk Group is virtually starting off at square one, as  all oil activities have either been divested or amortized. Two crucial  events in the coming weeks will set the stage for Maersk version 2.0.  ShippingWatch presents an overview."@ShippingWatch

7875 2018-02-08 06:55:45 long day & long night but just rubbed coconut oil all over my body & things are looking up
7876 2018-02-08 06:55:37 I have discovered the magic of Coconut Oil....

I cook with it, and i finally got the jarred kind today, Oh my gods, i used it in cake mix as a butter substitute, and dear gods above, it made the cake SO much richer~~<3
7877 2018-02-08 06:55:11 Oil collapse?
7878 2018-02-08 06:54:43 Are you ok?
The gift is oil.
7879 2018-02-08 06:54:33 I have a lot of oil value a day but why not have a value? I feel so strange
7880 2018-02-08 06:54:18 Smell like coconut oil and midnight summer dreams 
7881 2018-02-08 06:54:12 Sorry, he overachieved last year.

7883 2018-02-08 06:54:07 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
7884 2018-02-08 06:53:42 Egusi fifty, eja dindin 50, red oil 50, ata gigun 20, magi 10, onion 20. I will eat today and next day
7885 2018-02-08 06:53:33 What abt the land he's taking from Native Americans 2 give 2 oil industry?Why isn't any1 bringing this up?How abt prohibiting SIGAR from releasing public info on status of Afghanistan/Pakistan?SIGAR has been releasing reports 2 the public since the war began!WHAT'S GOING ON 
7886 2018-02-08 06:53:31 Ain't that the truth. And yet here we are. Stuck in the ground cuz the oil industry screwed up social license. We're even paying for orphan well liabilies and the Redwater decision means we pay for their polluter pay responsibility. What else is left? Maybe our first born child?
7887 2018-02-08 06:53:22 Yet people say otherwise.. Patty is a tough one to call. He had his best personal season.. but clearly there is more there. I would love to see him re signed at the right price. You can't say he is lacking this year when all numbers point to a copy of last year
7888 2018-02-08 06:53:03 His primary job on the top line is to score goals at the pace he did last season and that hasn't happened this year. So the numbers are not the same.
7889 2018-02-08 06:52:57 And how much durian seeds you need to make the oil?
7890 2018-02-08 06:51:42 I tend to agree with you. But AB never does proactive stuff. Just look at the env mess with tailings ponds. We're subsidizing the orphan wells. All of us paying for $30 million so big oil doesn't pay int. Tailings ponds as lake district.Jessica Ernst/Diana Daunheimer cases.
7891 2018-02-08 06:51:10 eucalyptus oil has been so much more loyal to me in the last 2 days than most people ever have been in my 19 years of life
7892 2018-02-08 06:51:00 Ooh, I like this.  This might be the only picture to use the Oil Painting that doesn't look absolutely terrible.  In fact, I think this is far from terrible.
=)
7893 2018-02-08 06:50:40 another possible indication of priorities:  the attack is said to have been an attempt to capture the Conoco oil fied.
7894 2018-02-08 06:50:04 And based on experience working in the renewable industry in Vancouver and in oil and gas in Alberta.
7895 2018-02-08 06:50:02 Looking at his career so far, yes, without question.
7896 2018-02-08 06:50:02 So what is the Oilers record against the Pacific again...nevermind ;)
7897 2018-02-08 06:49:58 Put oil on your head.. Robb on your forehead and at the back of your neck it helps.. How you now?

7901 2018-02-08 06:49:26 Invisible or not.. the fact is his numbers break down is very similar..  so did jecunderperform last year if people feel he is this year?
7902 2018-02-08 06:49:13 Yeah that's true I think some of the machine lifeforms leaked oil but at least people were getting eaten

7904 2018-02-08 06:49:01 I think they are worried by the increase in amounts. Also they are putting the pipeline in new areas. So I'd say they have reason to be cautious. In any case, the problem is social license. Maybe the oil industry needs to work on this? We've ignored well water on fire in Rosebud
7905 2018-02-08 06:48:52 This lil oil diffuser be putting me right to sleep
7906 2018-02-08 06:48:51 Kings outshot the Oilers 17-9 in the third, and outscored them 3-0. Oilers had some solid chances, for sure, but Kings had more, and capitalized.
7907 2018-02-08 06:48:38 What conditions/deficiencies might cause acid stomach and migraines from coconut oil or ascorbic/ascorbate supplements? Salicylate sensitivity?
7908 2018-02-08 06:48:28 He's not entirely..  but that is due to not being on the top line regularly..  but at the same time..  he is outputting the same as last year..  so did he underperform last year?
7909 2018-02-08 06:48:22 As a twitter psychologist and internets scientist, I can concur with Internets Dr. Brainbow here on the therapeutic benefits of cannabis oil and sexual relief via oral copulation.

7911 2018-02-08 06:48:18 We already depend upon the sun for life. Electricity is catching up. (PS.. coal and oil came from the sun too...). Solar is the only long term energy.
7912 2018-02-08 06:48:00 Hmm, heat from hairdryer to loosen the adhesive? But may damage leather. I rub a paste of baking soda mixed with olive oil to remove sticker from glass. Not sure if it works for leather.
7913 2018-02-08 06:47:50 Wagner mercs and Assad loyalists trying to sneak attack an oil field, violating an agreed upon demarcation line.  Crazy stuff.
7914 2018-02-08 06:47:48 The oilers hit 2 or 3 posts In the 3rd so you make a fair point.
7915 2018-02-08 06:47:44 We were water and red oil, & needed heat to blend.
7916 2018-02-08 06:47:21 welcome! kalau kulit ok dgn mineral oil boleh je pakai tau. but for me chaq mmg  tkleh go la ianya sudah terbukti haha
7917 2018-02-08 06:47:14 I saw it and read the piece a couple of days back when it went live & it changes nothing for me. He has been invisible on many a night and IMO, it's clear his pending departure and the team's lack of success has made him far less effective.
7918 2018-02-08 06:47:06 Lmaoo my lashes I got them done even though I have naturally long lashes I was just lazy to wear makeup  skin routine oh my lord girl i have a LIST lmao main things is witch hazel to tone the face tea tree oil Ambi cream for my dark spots water based hydro cream for everyday

7924 2018-02-08 06:46:28 They exaggerate ridiculously. I had a dumb friend in high school who grew his own shitty outdoor stuff, then dried it out in a friend‚Äôs house. Cops found it and confiscated it. He had a crock pot he was using to turn resin into hash oil and the newspapers called it:
7925 2018-02-08 06:46:22 External reserves increased by US$1.92bn in January to US$40.69bn. The rapid accumulation of US$12.69bn over 12 months is due to two sizeable Eurobond launches, a small diaspora bond issue and the recovery in oil export revenues .
7926 2018-02-08 06:45:58 And the US military has been using Silver Bullet gun oil all along because it is made with 13% liquefied pig fat which insures that any/every Muslim they have ever killed was sent straight to hell by Allah because they were contaminated when they died.
7927 2018-02-08 06:45:56 Ya I read the article a few days ago. Analytics are only 30% of the story. In watching the games, do you believe he is the same player as last year?
7928 2018-02-08 06:45:56 Had no problem with the 3rd. Had some 10 bell chances.I didn't see the Kings set any kind of tone IMO. They certainly played better In the 3rd as opposed to the 2nd, but they weren't marginally better than the Oil in the 3rd.

7936 2018-02-08 06:44:29 Mr. President : oil embargo to Venezuela please. @POTUS
7937 2018-02-08 06:44:25 No issues here. When a President appoints ministers they represent him in the ministry. If the President stands with his ministers which should be the case, no issues. That explains why Diezani Alison Maduekwe was very powerful as oil minister. Her DG wouldn‚Äôt dare her.
7938 2018-02-08 06:44:11 the spray is an oil, so you need to neutralize it. DO NOT GET IN A HOT SHOWER OR BATH!!!
7939 2018-02-08 06:43:56 Hot oil splashed up into my eye while making dinner so I think that‚Äôs my sign to go back to top ramen for a while..

How do we have peace? Govt sells crude oil,uses the profit to buy firearm for military
Military uses the firearms to fight Herdsmen, IPOB, Boko haram,etc.
All these are internal wars within Nigeria #rainbowmorninshow
7945 2018-02-08 06:42:58 The point is, if it was oil that got the goal it'd be called back 100%
7946 2018-02-08 06:42:32 No stat to measure compete, not there this year. It's obvious.
7947 2018-02-08 06:42:16 Amazing how that happens

Oil also dropped 2.5%.  On positive note, @Snapchat is up almost 50%, crypto currencies up
7957 2018-02-08 06:41:03 Sloppy third. Oilers played reactive hockey and let LA lead. A few solid chances, but definitely the Kings' period.
7958 2018-02-08 06:40:52 it‚Äôs lit, what abt lemon juice? im thinking of that & castor oil
7959 2018-02-08 06:40:49 Analytically, fine. Not the other 67% of the game though. All too obvious watching. Sorry.
7960 2018-02-08 06:40:48 If that is what a stat tells us, then it is a flawed stat. That simple.
7961 2018-02-08 06:40:25 @Lawrence What good news! Along with our return to ‚Äúclean‚Äù coal, we can now corner the market on another backwards looking fuel source ‚Äî oil!

8000 2018-02-08 06:34:30 India is Rich in it's resources, but the people are not in a position to utilize such resources. Majority of the people are middle income groups. Oil prices are shooting to ever records. It reduces the purchasing power. It is a symbol of papurism. The pmo should intervene.
8001 2018-02-08 06:34:20 coconut oil is the answer to many life‚Äôs problems
8002 2018-02-08 06:34:10 I just give my printer some cooking oil every two to three prints to keep it going. It jams whenever I don't
8003 2018-02-08 06:34:08 Alberta wants to move their oil through BC and in exchange we get a golf course, a bridge and a couple million dollars here and there. Were there to be a spill on BC soil or coast who would pay for the cleanup? @RachelNotley ??
8004 2018-02-08 06:33:42 My doctor says a little fish oil every day will do wonders for my squeaky fish problem.
8005 2018-02-08 06:33:30 wow after 2 weeks of not cooking dinner i mistook sesame oil for fish sauce and put too much in

8009 2018-02-08 06:32:56 Babaji plz also say something for the local edible oil producers who are not able to run their mills due to unregulated supply of imported and cheap edible oil like palm and canola
8010 2018-02-08 06:32:41 Already spent so much money this week & I still need to change my brakes and get my oil change tomorrow 
8011 2018-02-08 06:32:40 Couldn't agree more.
8012 2018-02-08 06:32:35 They played 1 solid period. First period was absolute garbage, and they let the Kings completely set the tone again in the third. After their game in Tampa, not showing up to start the game...again...is just mind numbing.
8013 2018-02-08 06:32:22 Especially when that is supposed to be part of their game. Lucic does it more but falls into the same category. IMO,  the group's play all comes back to a poorly constructed roster & an awful start...which brings us back to the roster.
8014 2018-02-08 06:32:18 Peter how will us oil stocks do?
8015 2018-02-08 06:32:00 Just picked through the CME Volume report.  Open Outcry Futures are also available in Eurodollar, 2,5,10 and 30 Year Treasury as well as Corn, CHI Wheat, KC Wheat, and Soybeans didn't catch if meal and oil was included or not and the $250 S&P.
8016 2018-02-08 06:31:50 Thanks I‚Äôll check this out! I usually use the skindinavia oil prevention sprays but I ran out 
8017 2018-02-08 06:31:46 His numbers/stats in angles are no different to last season. I'll dig up the numbers to prove it
8018 2018-02-08 06:31:37 coconut oil makes the best makeup remover
8019 2018-02-08 06:31:31 Less scoring, less involvement physically. Obvious when watching. Let someone else overpay him. He's gone.
8020 2018-02-08 06:31:18 Gotta get a oil change
8021 2018-02-08 06:31:03 Alberta oil delivers wine to Quebec. Oh wait it may have been Saudi Arabian oil.
8022 2018-02-08 06:30:56 If I were you I'd stop wasting my time on side shows, look at the proposal brought forward regarding the Turkana Oil and engage your Turkana brothers and the government on the same. But what do I know?
8023 2018-02-08 06:30:56 I'll find the info I saw.. his play and stats.. coral and such is nearly identical to last year.
8024 2018-02-08 06:30:24 oh come on, he was drunk. or, maybe he took some of those "snake oil" supplements Alex Jones is always trying to hawk.
8025 2018-02-08 06:29:59 Everyone I think the advice is good but showering and wiping down with Dawn is best first step to remove the bulk of the oil. It‚Äôs not very irritating and it emulsifies almost anything.
8026 2018-02-08 06:29:57 is there a full on dermal implant where you can just pop in a socket or something? you have a kinda needle under the skin thing..but I'm picturing how you'd oil up a sifi robot person lol

8030 2018-02-08 06:29:23 Interesting set of comments from Bharat Forge. Sees stronger demand in 4Q on local CV business; oil rebound to help rig counts; stake buy in EV startup looks strategic. Shares surge as expected. #India #earnings

8034 2018-02-08 06:28:58 Things have changed since October. Value ain't what it was back then. They also met last week. Guessing that meeting was more blunt.
8035 2018-02-08 06:28:57 someone sitting near me in the exam hall today had some really strong cologne or deodorant on and when i reached my seat, i instantly felt my migraine worsening  had to sit through 2 hours of that and i didn't have my medicated oil with me...almost left early because of that
8036 2018-02-08 06:28:36 I do believe his pending free agency has played a part in his struggles this season but the writing was on the wall last season. No way they could keep both him & Lucic on long term.

8040 2018-02-08 06:27:35 My hair is in braids with coconut oil, nobody bother me anymore
8041 2018-02-08 06:27:32 The Staples Center has been a house of horrors for the Oilers. I wasn't too upset with their play tonight tho. Got a little snake bitten In the 3rd and then took.a penalty late and couldn't kill It.While It looks like the PP Is turning. The PK is another story.
8042 2018-02-08 06:27:04 The same government will be at pains for they will have no option but to bring Miguna back
Case of frying oneself in his own oil
8043 2018-02-08 06:26:57 The team just doesn't seem to have any purpose to their play. FAR too passive in every respect this season. Patrick is a product of that. Both he and Kassian have to be shit-disturbers on every shift. Nothing bothers me more than big guys playing small. IMO
8044 2018-02-08 06:26:48 Need to go back to my hot oil treatments that grew my natural hair so fast and thicker
8045 2018-02-08 06:26:46 Definitely not expecting that many, but it lends to his involvement in games. He's as good as gone, and deservedly so.
8046 2018-02-08 06:26:20 #ok #BeardOil for #nerdinatub sampler sets mixed. Currently only 3 sets of 3 scents with a 6 carrier oil blend for hair and skin.
8047 2018-02-08 06:26:18 Big difference on the goal front and that needs to be his calling card. Hasn't played as much w/ 97 this year but his play has dictated that.
8048 2018-02-08 06:26:15 The nudes I am sending and the lavender oil I have in my diffuser are fighting for dominance over my mood
8049 2018-02-08 06:25:58 Put some spearmint oil drops all over my room & it smells like heaven
8050 2018-02-08 06:25:54 And 94% of "UKCS" is in Scottish waters.

There is some complicated maths regarding field production, so from memory I think we're accredited 88% of oil production in GERS, but that figure fluctuates.
8051 2018-02-08 06:25:51 Too little too late.  Saudi will go back to the olden days once oil is gone.  50 years down the line.
8052 2018-02-08 06:25:46 What about the oil drilling by Huntington Beach? It's that on fine just because Brown it's ok with it? What a hipocracy.

8057 2018-02-08 06:24:41 The question should be why Turkey, a NATO member nation , has exposed itself as the main handler of Al-Qaeda and other jihadist terror groups in Syria? Why Turkey would rather have ISIS as their neighbors on their southern border. Why would Turkey buy oil from ISIS?

8063 2018-02-08 06:23:49 I think oil is definitely the new wave

8102 2018-02-08 06:17:42 No, I agree, machine oil is a good smell. But I get strong woody notes, some citrus, moldy cheese, and uh...is that week-old severed arm I detect?  (Yeah, he replied, but WHOSE smart ass?)

8214 2018-02-08 06:02:39 Current pipelines are over-capacity & oil is being moved by rail and truck, both much more prone to spills than pipelines are. There's no "massive increase"; our province, and our country, need to get oil to overseas markets because biggest customer (US) is now biggest competitor

8249 2018-02-08 05:58:34 Because GOP is complicit and they could care less, most are leaving they know they are done. Question is why is trump so afraid ?? And GOP ? Putin money and investments in Oil and gas in Russia.

8253 2018-02-08 05:58:06 That goal gets disallowed if the Oilers score it..

But because it was scored on the Oil, I'm sure it'll count. Because @NHL reviews are always good to us.

8328 2018-02-08 05:47:33 It‚Äôs not too difficult. It centers around your batter choice and fryer. Pan frying is fine, as long as you have a thermometer and a deep enough pan. Also, don‚Äôt reuse oil often. Once or twice is fine, but over that is gnarly
8329 2018-02-08 05:47:27 That's pretty cool! @SerendipityDay1 need some hair oil?

 Moralizing has done very little by comparison.

8473 2018-02-08 05:22:44 #Kickboxer is still a classic. The remake (Kickboxer: Vengeance) is crap. Batista, while physically impressive visually, lacked any sense of menace. He was a terrible Tong-Po. The original *dripped* petty, tyrannical malevolence. Batista dripped baby oil or something.

8485 2018-02-08 05:20:36 Oh come on. You really are defending foreign oil companies exporting our product at criminal rates by saying Tides is to blame? We are literally giving away our best chance to drive our economy into a prime place in world innovation.

8504 2018-02-08 05:18:03 @jjhorgan @AJWVictoriaBC resolution to pipeline issue:
pass regs that stipulate pipeline & tanker companies have *unlimited liability* when it comes to oil spills (including cleanup, health costs, business losses, everything) and must demonstrate the financial capacity to pay.
8505 2018-02-08 05:17:42 Or better: eliminate the consumption of dirty energy. HOT TAKE HERE: leave the oil in the sand..... impacts outweigh any benefit here.

8513 2018-02-08 05:16:00 The artist is a stranger in the human person.

I quit painting because on a studio visit I grew sick from smell of turpentine and was horrified by sight of thick oil paint dripping from a canvas. 

The artist gains insight point at which the stranger undergoes a transformation.
8514 2018-02-08 05:15:59 sure, he played it fine as far as how you would coach a defensemen, but the fact that McDavid got off such a quality shot on his off-wing against such a premier player is impressive.
8515 2018-02-08 05:15:46 Blend 8 oz basil with 2 cups carrots. Add Olive Oil. Cut with butter. Serve over kale.
8516 2018-02-08 05:15:31 Obviously, it is not an ideal set-up but for the moment, it is what they need to do. What they need to do is get better players to surround their top guys with.
8517 2018-02-08 05:15:03 BC's tourism industry, beaches, whale watching, fisheries, and drinking water are all at risk if this "world class response" to oil spills is not in place.  @jjhorgan is wise to study the project.  He hasn't said no & probably won't.

8522 2018-02-08 05:14:20 We make it affordable by taxing oil and subsidizing renewables. That gets the economy moving in that direction. We are getting fleeced by China and the oil and pipe companies are the ones spinning the wool.
8523 2018-02-08 05:14:16 I have to stop asking why people in the East don‚Äôt stay up to watch McDavid play when I can‚Äôt do that when the Oil play one hour later than normal
8524 2018-02-08 05:13:35 Unfortunately, with the way this season has gone, small samples matter. Hence why they ran with the three centres when it was working. As far as the Crosby comparison goes, he's 21 not 30, plays on a poorly constructed roster & doesn't have Malkin on his side.

8532 2018-02-08 05:12:23 Yeah, they're pushing it. I don't disagree.  They could run 19 and 98 though and 97 should be able to make that work.
8533 2018-02-08 05:12:19 Gonna be a rough morning. Have to get up earlier than usual with crap weather en route to YYC. So if the Oil could score 4 quick ones to start 3rd, that'd be swell.

8544 2018-02-08 05:10:54 So Quebec is gonna buy more BC wine because they also don't want a pipeline because of environmental reasons. However, without a pipeline the oil will just be shipped by tankers which is much better for the environment. They can pollute their rivers but cannot support a pipeline

8562 2018-02-08 05:07:45 Oil
8563 2018-02-08 05:07:44 Yeah because we‚Äôre too stupid to use the largest oil reserves in the world to create our own renewables industry. 

Or we could actually build a national effort to do that.
8564 2018-02-08 05:07:43 See I want oilers to get better wingers but when your team is 2 offensive players deep I am not sure if loading them up is optimum. Right now they are both red hot and 97 is singlehandedly carrying this team but what do you do when slump hits ?
8565 2018-02-08 05:07:35 Disagree with this too. The data doesn't really support this idea. I do think the Oilers believe in goals in small samples though. Easy sell for 97 too - Crosby has won two Cups in a row doing this, why can't you?
8566 2018-02-08 05:07:24 This is totally stupid especially on the part of AB, ultimately oil is going to die and BC will always have a port, AB should play nicer

8584 2018-02-08 05:04:11 I don't think BC will retaliate... Simply because other then beef ... What does BC buy from Alberta? The oil is from some refinery in the US, not alberta-stan. And the beef is mostly Australian now?
8585 2018-02-08 05:04:08 If my grandma taught me anything it‚Äôs that oil of Olay is the best moisturizer on the planet no arguments
8586 2018-02-08 05:04:08 Yes because they are actually scoring some goals. The notion that you can throw anyone w/ 97 is not only inaccurate, it is also a great way to piss off your franchise player. He needs to play with skill...not plugs.
8587 2018-02-08 05:04:02 #bcwinechat - my wife and I both worked in Calgary in oil and gas for years before starting the winery.  Wineries aren't protesting pipelines.
8588 2018-02-08 05:03:57 Or, twin an pipe to ship more oil to China and fatten the KM bank account while sipping Ontario wine. 

That‚Äôs pretty much the choice.

8590 2018-02-08 05:03:52 PSA: use tea tree oil to clear acne. (DO NOT use on your entire face, only spot treat)
8591 2018-02-08 05:03:51 Yes, it's been there for years, but the concern is that if there is a spill, it will be considerably more devastating than refined oil, and that the pipeline goes through densely populated areas. I think both sides are over-simplifying the issues.

Whats happening:
the province of BC wants to protect coastline from oil spills, so they want science. Alverta premier put an import ban on BC wines because of that.

8896 2018-02-08 04:23:47 Would there be the harm if royalties declined to a point where the province could no longer subsidize healthcare and education? The Alberta advantage and infrastructure we have was built on oil revenue. Yes, over time it needs to change, but BC can‚Äôt act unilaterally.

8920 2018-02-08 04:19:56 I‚Äôm not sure what point this makes.
I agree oil is less than ideal but these situations occur unless we decide to not export oil at all. The question remains how -pipeline, truck or rail because blocking pipelines a statistically more dangerous. This is not binary
8921 2018-02-08 04:19:54 I always find oil protests just a bit off. I too want a safe environment. But I shake my head sometimes at protesters. Every item they own, including their home, clothing, food, vehicles, literally everything at some point was impacted by oil.  It‚Äôs interesting.

9008 2018-02-08 04:09:26 Bode lost a shoe while we got our car's oil changed and one of the mechanics called Zach and said Bode was one of the cutest babies he's ever seen so he's going to keep his shoe there so we can pick it up so he can say hi to his friend again. Bode makes more friends than us. 
9009 2018-02-08 04:09:21 They do that to stir up fears. Reality is most in oil don't work all season now. They could be retraining while on shut down. Though most of the skills learned working oil are same they'd use in green sector anyway.
9010 2018-02-08 04:09:14 Except for the floids, massive hurricanes, coastal erosion , rising sea level, etc.  Continuing to drill oil is good for his business interests tho.
9011 2018-02-08 04:09:13 #WindPower criticized by OK oil barons. In response, Wind made an offer: We‚Äôd take same tax structure as oil and gas. We‚Äôd even go higher rate day one, match whatever they‚Äôd do for #oklaed. Rejected, because the goal of oil CEOs in OK is to kill renewables, not compete fairly.

9027 2018-02-08 04:07:03 The replacement will happen gradually even if we go hard like China it will still take enough time for jobs to be replaced with greener technologies. That's one of the biggest misconceptions oil industry preaches is the loss of jobs will be staggering and it will happen fast.
9028 2018-02-08 04:06:52 The technology is rapidly increasing so hopefully sooner than later it will be cost affordable solution just throwing some ideas out there for energy that's not oil

9172 2018-02-08 03:51:29 Tonight I am doing my part of support the BC wine industry in lieu of the Alberta NDP attack. And I am raising a toast to Alberta oil patch workers who are goat horned by the BC NDP. Bottom line I say raise a middle finger to anti-job NDP.
9173 2018-02-08 03:51:20 I put coconut oil in my hair to help with my scalp being so dry but I put too much so now I feel like a super greasy b o i
9174 2018-02-08 03:51:16 Sure. In that case, you would need to vote with your money and stop driving cars as well. FYI- Majority of oil is produced in middle east and Russia
9175 2018-02-08 03:51:13 There exists no ability in Canada to deal with a bitumen spill. So Alberta is expecting BC to accept all the risk while Alberta gleans all the rewards. By the way who are the real winners if this project goes ahead, who are the real beneficiaries? BIG OIL.

Calgary relies more on the oil industry than Detroit relied on the auto industry before it became a shithole. Without the oil industry half of Calgary would be abandoned and the other half would be populated just by gangs.

9409 2018-02-08 03:26:44 You are not the only one who noticed this. I find it an odd coincidence that the Dow tanked exactly when oil started to tank, especially $XLE. Recent Dow rally had a huge influence by the energy sector, when that stopped, so did the Dow.

9507 2018-02-08 03:14:31 On the long chart, WTI is at a major support, the 2015 high ~61.20.
If it closes below that level, it is the market claiming the rally in oil is over.  IMO, it would be the wrong call, and future economics will DEMAND a much higher price.  But the mkt will decide, each day.

9517 2018-02-08 03:13:18 Oil? What? Who said something about oil, bitch you cooking?
9518 2018-02-08 03:13:03 serum is ur active ingredient if u have a skin concern it has the highest concentration of whatever specific thing u need and it's usually like a light cream under ur moisturizer !! face oil is different it's a softener and it locks in ur hydration
9519 2018-02-08 03:12:54 I went all the way to Cambridge to buy tea tree oil yesterday because I'm not finna break out right before Black Solidarity Conference.
9520 2018-02-08 03:12:51 Life is tough for wealthy oil CEOs these days, apparently. Perhaps we should start a GoFundMe for the poor man's collection?
9521 2018-02-08 03:12:46 Our military has always been the greatest, largest and most advanced military in the world. What we don't to  have are warmongering Presidents engaging us in unwinnable wars over oil and poppy plants

9527 2018-02-08 03:12:04 Ron Grooms voted against CBD oil today, which has no psychoactive effects or recreational use- purely medicinal. Think this might have something to do with the thousands of dollars he gets from big pharma? Luckily, the majority of the Senate saw the benefits and it passed anyway!
9528 2018-02-08 03:12:03 And if your arguement is if we sell oil to communist China, the Saudis are going to stop persecuiting their own population then I stand by my previous statement, 
you are out of your mind.

9548 2018-02-08 03:09:41 #WOW = Water Oil Wine. The debate over #SiteC, Pipelines and Wine is stupid to the last drop.
9549 2018-02-08 03:09:36 I really think the oil exploration at Turkana,is making them have so much interest in Kenya.
9550 2018-02-08 03:09:29 Carl Lewis was even dirtier.
9551 2018-02-08 03:09:26 There is only 53 yrs of Oil left on Planet Earth at this particular moment. 

Be careful what you wish for.
9552 2018-02-08 03:09:20 It camps well. IMO Corned Beef and Olive Oil more kinda lightweight, goes OK w/ cheese mac esp. Cracker Barrel brand, apologies to vegans in #conservation
9553 2018-02-08 03:09:12 You still never answered the question about the ISIS oil. Did Erdogan not see the thousands of oil tankers going into Turkey every day ? He didn't know ? Why has he imprisoned hundreds of journalists, hundreds of Turkish judges ? civil servants ?
9554 2018-02-08 03:09:05 @lbuckpchd has an oil for that...

9560 2018-02-08 03:08:41 I was going to suggest an oil over your lotion. I don‚Äôt use a natural one though also your soap might be contributing to the dryness
9561 2018-02-08 03:08:35 @EmmanuelMacron the leader of our @EPA @ScottPruittOK is a climate denier who works with oil/gas companies to rape our country and world of natural resources by any means necessary. He wants to debate climate change. Can you send some experts here to debate this clown?!?
9562 2018-02-08 03:08:35 These are leftist activists! They are spoiled children! What if Wesrern provinces can sell their oil and Quebec can‚Äôt sell her hydro electricity to ?

9573 2018-02-08 03:07:04 Ive heard peppermint essential oil on your wrists is great. Also eucalyptus and spearmint work great- you can even make a balm with tea tree, euc, spearmint and coconut oil and use it as moisturizer.
9574 2018-02-08 03:06:57 If you used anything other than oil, then you‚Äôre not doing your anointing right.

9588 2018-02-08 03:04:36 My beliefs are that we shouldnt be importing oil from overseas to use as a replacement for our own oil. If we only used Canadian oil in Canada and oil from no where else, Alberta would be doing just fine and maybe we wouldnt need a pipeline.
9589 2018-02-08 03:04:35 So we are boycotting wine from BC because British Columbia wants to expand oil pipelines through the Canadian Rockies into Alberta?

9628 2018-02-08 02:59:28 I think you're probably right.  My sense is she knows that oil is a key to recovery for Alberta, but at the same time, put money into new technology so the province isn't a one trick pony.

9630 2018-02-08 02:59:19 It's called American greed. If they can't make money off of it, they won't do it. It's one reason why the U.S. won't move away from fossil fuels. Gas and oil companies haven't figured out how to make money on clean energy. Weren't we supposed to have flying cars by now?
9631 2018-02-08 02:59:10 You realize that Elon is working for clean energy and Not oil?Why can't you get on the right side of history & out of the business of polluting our water and air?

9641 2018-02-08 02:58:04 a country in this day and age cannot live on agriculture and oil alone. you can have fantastic techniques and still fail because others simply have the ability to do more with worse techniques
9642 2018-02-08 02:58:01 To a degree yes. Those who suggest steroids are the same as greenies is absurd but they certainly did help. With that said, not everyone was juicing in MLB but I'm confident in saying the top sprinters in the works were all on something in Ben's prime.
9643 2018-02-08 02:57:59 Me too  I started using almond oil but I need to deep condition more.
9644 2018-02-08 02:57:57 the best way to heal a severed limb is to continually dip the open wound in a big container of luke warm coconut oil. don't forget to cut carbs and eat vegetables. A healthy lifestyle can be fun,
9645 2018-02-08 02:57:48 I mentioned the same thing happens outside of crypto trading. Trade Oil, or S&P Futures, and the same thing happens.  I don't see nearly the issues of HFT/Algos in Crypto, as I do in CL or ES (not saying there isn't shenanigans in crypto, I know there is)

9660 2018-02-08 02:55:51 I think a lot can be done to reclaim areas that have been mined and bring them up to a more productive ecological level. I will be happy when that is done for the majority of the areas where the buried oil has been exposed and now leaks to the environment. It can be done well.
9661 2018-02-08 02:55:38 Can we talk about the problems palm oil has created! I "lady chips
9662 2018-02-08 02:55:34 Einstein econuts say different. Of course they won‚Äôt back it up with how they would replace all the products that are produced by the petroleum industry, or get around without the oil and gas production, but when you live in a world of lollipops and unicorns, you don‚Äôt need facts
9663 2018-02-08 02:55:34 They have no oil, they import all their oil, so they want to reduce their dependence on oil imports as much as possible. The US has plenty of oil.

9668 2018-02-08 02:54:59 True for train spills, too. Oil is a dirty, but necessary biz. They‚Äôve come light years since the start, tho, much like car engines. 
Oil must get to market. It helps pay for social services we want to have and causing energy poverty hurts the most vulnerable. We all use it.
9669 2018-02-08 02:54:57 Bet everyone in that 1988 race was on the sauce. Either drop the whole race or just leave the day's results as is. No way Lewis should have a gold medal.

9673 2018-02-08 02:54:42 It is called corruption. When oil and other corporations bribe politicians to make each other rich while the rest suffer, you get Africa and now America.
9674 2018-02-08 02:54:42 On the other hand‚Ä¶say you like chocolate chip cookies. Say you're given a plateful, only oil is substituted for butter, oatmeal for flour&raisins for chips.The cookies may be tasty, but they aren't chocolate chip. (1 of 2)

9686 2018-02-08 02:52:57 Well @RachelNotley maybe you could build refineries so you can ship clean oil in those pipelines you want to run through our Province? At least we know how to clean that up when it spills. #nobitumen #BCwine
9687 2018-02-08 02:52:53 $SNDE now none of this may happen because  soft oil market lately, a 33% drop in the share price. AU roos would rather have this cmpy go NK
9688 2018-02-08 02:52:50 You haven't lifted a finger to shut down the currently operating offshore oil rigs in California's state and municipal waters.
9689 2018-02-08 02:52:45 Then your state should go without gas and oil
9690 2018-02-08 02:52:41 @RachelNotley What will YOU do if your precious oil bursts out of the pipeline? Or a ship has a spill here? YOU going to clean it up? Irreplaceable environment & species already under stress due to man and obsession for $. You've only proved Alberta matters, not Canada.

A lot of folks seem to be interested in Cuba as an example of a case study re: peak oil.
9692 2018-02-08 02:52:37 And the oil rigs are still off the coast of Santa Barbara.

9709 2018-02-08 02:50:03 I've anecdotal evidence: using tea tree oil on my toenail after a summer of sweaty 50k training killed off the funk underneath it. It grew out w/ no more continuing issues. That's all I got though--certainly not a double blind study & only for tea tree oil as a fungicide. Haha.
9710 2018-02-08 02:50:00 The studies were done. How do you think oil reaches you now ?? Rail, truck huge polluters. The NEB passed this in 2016 one 157 Points cleared. This hurts all of Canada. I‚Äôm a Canadian first & always.

9727 2018-02-08 02:48:47 A lot of angst and brouhaha created for nothing by BC NDP Oil material already flows both by pipeline and rail. The proposal is to essentially replace current rail exports with a parallel pipeline.
9728 2018-02-08 02:48:37 Washington State gets most of its nat gas from Canada not the other way around. Also, Alberta controls 90% of the refined fuel/crude oil that goes to the BC lower mainland and 100% of the jet fuel that runs YVR. If AB turns it off, BC is done. Period.

Good to know you and all the other oil dipsticks will come down to the coast with your bucket when the spill occurs... 
9756 2018-02-08 02:45:17 Clueless. Where do you think your oil comes from ??Half the oil you use comes from AB. All of the jet fuel used at YVR comes from AB and is processed in AB   If you want to have an argument get your facts straight. If you don‚Äôt need our oil walk, cycle and turn off the lights.
9757 2018-02-08 02:45:14 hell yeah man! Just remember to be smart with your motor mods, they really dont like more than 350 hp without internals, make sure to always check oil and coolant and itll treat you right, also be gentle on that 5 speed. Other than that you'll fall in love.

9762 2018-02-08 02:44:39 I know we all benefit from the money that comes from oil.
I don't want us all to be jobless or whatever.  But we have to start transitioning.  It's not going to be easy.  Money won't just keep flowing so much.  
But money this easy at the cost of nature... It needs to change

9807 2018-02-08 02:38:09 And, it will not hurt oil and gas development one bit. It is time they pay their fair share...that‚Äôs all I want to see happen...stop taking and start paying...
