36 2018-10-25 23:46:59 Of all my individual stocks I hold (30) I had to take a $1K loss today because the category is simply too volatile. As much as I hated to do that, even though it was $1K in the black a week ago, it was the smart move for me. More disciplined. #money #stocks #investing #retirement
37 2018-10-25 23:46:56 Good thing I don’t have stocks
38 2018-10-25 23:46:10 Great second ammendment.   All the lives lost in mass shootings mean nothing to you.

43 2018-10-25 23:43:45 So in conclusion leafy is just into stocks now?
44 2018-10-25 23:43:16 Definitely could be a good fit at the trading nation
45 2018-10-25 23:42:08 Stocks that reported in the US include @Amazon and @Twitter. Amazon missed revenue, leading to its stock down 7% and Twitter beat profit guidance and revenue, with the stock surging 15%. 

Today Chinese industrial profits are out following by the first reading of US Q3 GDP.
46 2018-10-25 23:41:57 I am so sick of the lefts dirty games. It’s pretty obvious what they are trying to do. The Republicans didn’t do this, just like Kavanaugh didn’t didn’t rape Ford and Trump didn’t conspire with the Russians. Our stocks and economy didn’t tank and Trump is behind their success.
47 2018-10-25 23:41:34 President Draghi stated Italy needs to agree to conditions on public spending before it receives any more help. On This the #EUR was down, as was the #GBP on lingering Brexit concerns. 
Oil continued higher after its recents lows, and iron ore, unlike stocks, is in a bull market
48 2018-10-25 23:41:15 William O’Neil says that “If you aren’t willing to pay 25-50x earnings for growth stocks, you will automatically eliminate the best investments available. You would have missed out on Microsoft, Cisco, AOL, & Home Depot during their greatest growth periods.” Growth vs value
49 2018-10-25 23:40:46 Wall St was led higher by tech stocks, as the @Nasdaq rallied 3.5% amongst other indexes to recover some of the losses from the day prior. The #ECB maintained its plans to purchase bonds at the end of the year. The #ASX is trading up recovering some of yesterday's losses
50 2018-10-25 23:39:07 My disappointed Dem friends on Trump’s election: “Well, at least my stocks are going up!”
51 2018-10-25 23:38:49 Funny how the chat with a few of my WS friends has gone from full blown crypto to 100% stocks.

They don't even want to hear the word crypto 
52 2018-10-25 23:36:51 @realDonaldTrump the sooner there’s a trade deal with #China, the sooner that stocks recover.
53 2018-10-25 23:36:50 About to join @MichelleMakori on @i24NEWS_EN to talk #Stocks #Amazon #Alphabet & #SaudiArabia
54 2018-10-25 23:35:07 Bullshit. Stocks are probably falling because Trump/GOP are destabilizing the country.
55 2018-10-25 23:35:06 ... And the American people will pay higher prices, lose jobs, and stocks will tumble. We are NOT that ignorant, Mr. President. The cost of these tariffs have to be made up somehow. And it is coming out of the pockets of Americans.
56 2018-10-25 23:34:50 Universal background checks and banning bump stocks is a good start. If, however, the problem of gun violence persists, would restricting access to assault weapons ever become an option you'd be willing to consider?
57 2018-10-25 23:34:41 Pockets of value, but I don’t think the bleeding in FANG-like stocks is over yet
58 2018-10-25 23:34:38 Not my kind of market, most stocks are too stretched to the downside. Patience I guess.

60 2018-10-25 23:34:22 Yeah, thats just the change in value of the stocks and bonds I've invested in. Stocks cant have a negative value. I also collect dividends which offset a little of it too.
61 2018-10-25 23:33:36 Don’t want to slam sis, but is this what it takes to shake supporting a maniac? losing money?  Kids caged, cowboy Congress, no affordable H/C, threat of SS cuts!?!There’s so much more to gauge the health of the nation than just stocks. I’m sure she is a lovely lady but...geez

73 2018-10-25 23:28:00 $DVMT it seemed investors not only liked stocks today but they jumped back into this name as options trading returned  with Jan 95 call buying.
74 2018-10-25 23:27:47 I believe in a place called America where it’s always a bad idea to talk about shorts. 

But I’m genuinely mostly sitting in cash and watching. My stocks are big, boring and safe-ish. Did you see $AMZN today? You don’t need to be part of that mess.

79 2018-10-25 23:26:15 There is more than one way to become wealthy - starting a business, investing in rental properties, investing in stocks, working in a high income profession for years, etc. - but there is a common trend among all people who become wealthy: they spend less than they earn.

86 2018-10-25 23:23:44 If we do business all investments going into the music run them stocks up
87 2018-10-25 23:23:34 Forex? Stocks? Commodities??
88 2018-10-25 23:23:30 Stocks need to fall. Many stocks are trading at 15x, 20x, 30x forward earnings. Talk about over-valued. When a 50¢ loaf of bread costs $3, it can only mean 2 things:

1. The bread is overpriced.
2. The dollar is worth less.

The rest is smoke-filled, coffee house crap.

95 2018-10-25 23:17:24 1) Q: Do you believe more federal restrictions are needed for gun owners?
Morelle: We should have universal background checks. I don't think they go far enough. I would urge a national ban on assault style weapons. I would ban bump stocks.
96 2018-10-25 23:17:12 Stocks are only up since Home Affairs Insider spills the beans. Is that doing it right?
97 2018-10-25 23:15:50 Just note if you don’t see me tweeting about calls and puts on stocks, that means I’m not trading. Don’t have the capital for these swing trades. I’ll give my opinion but that’s about it. Shit is to wild

On a related note. Dollarama stocks have skyrocketed!
102 2018-10-25 23:12:49 For company that size, Google grew at a phenomenal rate.  It's other businesses are just ramping up.  If shares fall tomorrow, it is a time to pick up some.  Expect the stocks to jump to $1350 within a year.
103 2018-10-25 23:12:20 For those who followed my advice to short the Stock indexes. lower Buy-stops on the Dec. Dow to 25,230 & to 2725 on the DEC. E-mini S&P TO TAKE Profit's.

106 2018-10-25 23:08:51 Maybe stocks are falling because they went up way too high. Stocks have to recapitulate to grow again.

108 2018-10-25 23:07:23 Market II: Top industry groups during Thursday's rebound were quite diverse: #automakers, #retail #internet, #gaming, game #software, #lodging, #oil drilling, Chip gear. All up 3.5%-plus. Defensive #stocks post sharpest drops; #gold #mining #food #utility #alcohol sink 1%+
109 2018-10-25 23:07:08 That's the entire market - not individual funds. Ever heard of shortsellers? They make a killing on tanking targeted individual stocks. Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan make money both ways. Just end of year profit taking by fund managers.
110 2018-10-25 23:06:59 oh shut up. You are another manipulating big mouth. All you thieves are doing is looting small time investors like myself out of our 401k. There was no reason for stocks to crash except for few en-cashing their profits for fat xmas bonus. Legal mafia at best
111 2018-10-25 23:06:53 So stocks went up $400 today @larry_kudlow.  Does that mean Democrats will win the midterms, begin 'pro-growth policies' and re-establish a sense of SANITY!
112 2018-10-25 23:06:53 Maybe more people will look at their stocks and figure out our fearless leader is not helping our retirement much..

115 2018-10-25 23:03:29 Small investors should stop putting money into stocks through their 401K and IRAs. I wonder from where the over paid wall street thieves will make money from then? #StockMarket #StockMarketNews

130 2018-10-25 22:56:58 Fucc I need to try that.  Wegmans always stocks tri-tips and I need to snag them more often.
131 2018-10-25 22:56:31 why are the rats of that group always compete everything? They are even putting a debate about stocks of companies lmao. Kids better read economics.
132 2018-10-25 22:56:06 One reason behind the October stock scare could be investors predicting a recession within the next few years. Continue to watch your stocks! #SUACCF18
133 2018-10-25 22:55:03 I agree on bump stocks as well.  They aren’t needed.
134 2018-10-25 22:54:59 @jimcramer a few weeks ago you mentioned the benefits of diversification and mentioned European stocks. Any suggestions? Does your fund hold any?
135 2018-10-25 22:54:49 There really isn’t #’s worth getting excited for that hasn’t already been priced in over this past year. Not even that but, for a few months now I literally could not comprehend how investors are buying stocks when they’re staring in the l.i.t.e.r.a.l face of a bear market
136 2018-10-25 22:53:54 Step away.  Clear mind.  Emotions high right after market closes and we’ve lost a lot of our energy by this time of day. I know I have as I get up very early.  It’s not end of the world. Pullbacks happen. Look how far all these stocks have gone since 1/1/18 and since 1/1/17 ..

139 2018-10-25 22:53:12 You do know the stock market fluctuates. Right? 

Are you trying to gauge the POTUS success on stocks? What is your metrics on that? 

How how many gauges do you have?
140 2018-10-25 22:52:11 I hope you realize he doesn't own the market. Nobody can predict the bottom in this market. You have to be patient and ride out the storm. These stocks will go up.
141 2018-10-25 22:50:58 I love monitoring stocks.
142 2018-10-25 22:50:21 To your credit, your openness to universal background checks and a ban on armor piercing ammunition is more than most on the right would even consider. We can't even get these, which many think of as "low hanging fruit". (Anyone remember the failed attempt to ban bump stocks?)
143 2018-10-25 22:50:09 I don't concern myself where stocks are 'tomorrow'.. but I do worry about where they will be a year, or two or five years from now.
144 2018-10-25 22:49:52 I really don't think the market is convinced "yet" that stocks have broke the uptrend. I (personally) would argue differently, and I think the USDJPY is close to taking notice of that. Keep in mind the Naz was up nearly 70% from the night of the election in 2016!! Now, still 50%!
145 2018-10-25 22:49:07 30-8-18: XJO 6350
30-9-18 XJO 6200
25-10-18 XJO below 5700
That's what -10% in 2 months looks like ($10B out of our market) !!!
Are all our stocks really worth 10% less??? (or is someone about to buy some bargains)

148 2018-10-25 22:47:08 Oooo good idea! Not sure if my local stocks it but I’ll check. Wearing a blue evening dress with silver at the weekend and realised all my eyeshadow is gold/brown and rose gold/pink 
149 2018-10-25 22:45:47 That's the advantage of hindsight. If you had tweeted two years ago to plop $10K into stocks and watch it grow, I would be super impressed.
150 2018-10-25 22:45:34 Oh yes the lefties made Megyn say racially insensitive remarks, forced Trump to be an asshole & sent bombs to murder the entire leadership of the Democratic Party. We're also to blame for stocks losing all gains of 2018, the Russians interfering in elections, caravans, & deficit.

154 2018-10-25 22:42:49 Some days I feel like I've really got my stuff together and then days like today I have to send emails that say "to be quite honest somebody should have stopped be from buying stocks because I know nothing about this stuff and I don't understand the website, please help me."

161 2018-10-25 22:39:13 The selloff in these seemed like a knee jerk exposure reflex...stocks up, gold stocks down. Gold itself was steady?! Gold is going higher and these stocks have massive operating leverage.

163 2018-10-25 22:36:27 That´s where the money will be flowing in the near future when people will start to panic on stocks and switch to #Crypto

She doesn’t really owe the Northern Hemisphere anything. Our WFA stocks are thin but I wouldn’t exactly say that Hartnell and Humidor Timeform as plodders.
172 2018-10-25 22:29:50 Lol I’m sure you have so much in stocks it’s hurting you. Obama Bailee our banks, car companies, AND the housing industry. We’ll help the farmers until a more fair trade deal is acceptable. You have a problem with helping farmers to seek a more fair trade?
173 2018-10-25 22:28:29 Hmm, sounds a lot like the strong words around banning bump stocks after Las Vegas!  That never happened!
174 2018-10-25 22:28:14 $amzn still one of the best long term stocks out there. Just depends on your market objectives
175 2018-10-25 22:27:29 I look at a lot of charts of a lot of stocks and see a lot of room to fall.

But don't mind me, I lived through the last two crashes, I'm probably just reliving the past.
176 2018-10-25 22:27:16 Mining stocks getting killed today as bad as Tech stocks yesterday. Your strategy ain’t working
177 2018-10-25 22:25:58 Stocks always do better under Dems.  More jobs are created under Dems. Deficits are bigger under the GOP.  Facts are pesky things.
178 2018-10-25 22:25:58 Nice call, I thought about going in on that one with you some time ago, but I'm too scared to short small-cap mo-mo stocks.
179 2018-10-25 22:25:09 Same. I was already tired of them over promoting it anyway. But I wonder how doing this show will affect WWE’s stocks, since they seem to think they’re invincible now that their stocks are doing so well.
180 2018-10-25 22:24:27 What other stocks do you like?
181 2018-10-25 22:24:13 And like the old adage that trump lives by, "any news is good news". She'll get paid and her stocks will rise among her supporters.
182 2018-10-25 22:23:38 If you can't sistematize and automate your business (strategies), you don't have a business, you have a unscalable job.
Maybe that's why there are so many new low experienced but good performing gurus. More if it's low float stocks. Not hating, just thoughts.
183 2018-10-25 22:22:35 we're discussing stocks to watch, how to read stock charts using our methodology so you can find top growth stocks, and how to master proper buy/sell rules. And investors can ask us their trading Qs!
184 2018-10-25 22:21:06 The way I see it a stock market crash will just speed up the crypto bear market and end it sooner. If BTC can hit 3k and stocks bottom soon after then we may then be ready for the next crypto bull market.
185 2018-10-25 22:19:35 Of course. That’s the sane thing to do. Ban assault weapons and large magazines and bump stocks. Thorough back ground checks.

193 2018-10-25 22:09:49 That's a matter of perspective. It's up $1500 from one year ago today. BTC has been more stable than stocks the last couple months. Zoom out. (Also, my point was about how most "crypto" has performed worse against BTC)
194 2018-10-25 22:09:49 It Makes Sense on "Stock Market" And Intellectual Property And Their "Acquisitions" And "Mergers" on "R&D" or "Defense" Are Not The Profit They Are The Debts on Daily Stocks.

238 2018-10-25 21:48:34 I don't believe that a stock market crash will help crypto. If anything, it will prolong the crypto bear market.

At this point, it's foolish to think that people will abandon stocks during a crash and instead choose a highly speculative investment that is down 90%.

250 2018-10-25 21:41:50 I was playing golf 3 wks ago with some folks at a charity golf outing. Talk turned to business. They were so bullish. They said Merrill Lynch was their broker they told them at least 4 more yrs of great economy. I went to cart went short stocks and cash 401k!
251 2018-10-25 21:40:49 While I know I am not always going to be right when it comes to stocks, I tweeted a month ago about all the AMZN upgrades was a terrible signal to me+the constant ignoring of over valuation,turns out I was dead right in this case. If you listened you're down 400 pts @GuyAdami

255 2018-10-25 21:39:34 I also haven’t used twitter since I worked on the campaign. You just don’t like someone younger than you who actually knows a little bit about politics. Stocks have risen in nine of the first ten months of the Trump Administration, a record that no other U.S. president can match.
256 2018-10-25 21:39:33 The real question is what has he been doing for 10 months? Just sitting inside playing video games and checking Coinbase and Stocks every now and then?
257 2018-10-25 21:38:58 Thanks for this tweet! Amazing that people buy and sell stocks based only on the headline numbers!
258 2018-10-25 21:38:46 I like the new look Emily, keep up the good work & can you please put a  under these LI stocks, down too long.
259 2018-10-25 21:38:31 Funny, DeSantis didn’t say anything about sensible gun legislation and doesn’t support a ban on bump stocks or military style assault weapons! He’s another Republican NRA sellout!
260 2018-10-25 21:38:30 You should also believe that bump stocks and assault weapon bans don’t infringe either
261 2018-10-25 21:38:18 US Empire now pays half a trillion dollars in interest payments per year to service its debt.

US debt increases by a trillion per year. It’s a death spiral that cannot be undone.

Self destruction and USD collapse are unavoidable. Get out of USD and US stocks. Buy gold & crypto.
262 2018-10-25 21:38:03 Though I still prefer stocks with lower absolute and relative valuations, less excess premium stocks/sectors which have protected your portfolio much better than these high-fliers that have been crushed but now buyable..

265 2018-10-25 21:37:19 I think it ws percentage of stocks owned by *union* pension funds specifically, with much of the remainder of the stock owned by retirement accounts being owned by the retirement accounts of executives & the 1%. But I'll tell you if I find the breakdown.

272 2018-10-25 21:33:52 You are only showing the W5000 index and 6 mo on that is +4.84% and the 2 yr performance is +25.70%. Long term US equity investment looks good to me. When I first started investing the DOW was at 1289, and people told me to stay away from stocks. Dow today almost 25,000. Go Long!

285 2018-10-25 21:31:56 FX Summary: A rebound in stocks in NY helped calm markets with most currencies relatively quiet. EUR was impacted by ECB only slightly as Italy/German concerns weighed once again.

288 2018-10-25 21:30:17 A rebound in stocks in NY helped calm markets with most currencies relatively quiet. EUR was impacted by ECB only slightly as Italy/German concerns weighed once again.
289 2018-10-25 21:30:02 I’ve never seen so much complacency out there. This is what happens when the FED and CB’s backstop everyone. No one believes stocks can fall and THAT my friends is what makes this market really dangerous, imo. AAPL will miss earnings write it down. Gap to 190
290 2018-10-25 21:28:57 U.S. stocks rebound close on Thursday 10/25/18: $DJIA +1.63% (+401.1) at 24,984.55, $SPX +1.86% (+49.4) at 2,705.57, $COMPQ +2.95% (+209.9) at 7,318.34.
291 2018-10-25 21:28:43 Calling it now. We open massively red tomorrow, and then reverse. Technicals are terrible, sentiment sucks. The economy is not that bad, these stocks are not that expensive, and the bulls are not dead yet.
292 2018-10-25 21:28:23 U.S. stocks jumped on Thursday, giving the Nasdaq its biggest daily gain since March, as Microsoft's upbeat earnings spurred a rebound in technology names and investors snapped up oversold shares.
293 2018-10-25 21:28:22 I’ve got no problem with Left, what u see is what u get.  

But it did not take ‘massive balls’ to get long TSLA for a trade into earnings.  He’s a shrewd trader and knows what stocks will react to his work.
294 2018-10-25 21:28:21 Perhaps you did not plan your entry into the stocks well. Most unfortunate. I was not holding BLPH. I was+continue to hold APTO, DMCAF+ONCY. I find myself still nicely positioned in all and am continuing to add. GL to you. You need to take responsibility for your own Investments.
295 2018-10-25 21:27:56 beyond behavioral and leverage reasons, isnt it also possible that higher beta stocks get support from funds that need to manage active share - aka form of closet indexing, some funds have to own high beta stocks to reduce tracking error than if they had no constraints?
296 2018-10-25 21:26:18 JPMorgan calculates that some $7.4 trillion in stocks would be subject to #forced selling by #passive #funds during  next downturn. the truth is that if and when some $7.4 T in selling starts without central bank backstops to soak it all up, there will be no place to hide.!!

Investors are pulling money before it drops more low simple
303 2018-10-25 21:23:56 There is correlation. Bitcoin precedes markets. BTC crash was indicating stockmarkets crash. Why? BTC ICO craze was mirroring & sharing hot money fuel of craze on stock market bubble (esp tech stocks). Risk off will initially impact BTC ahead of antyrisk rebound (same as gold).
304 2018-10-25 21:23:28 Pretty sure he is invested in Canadian weed stocks and this is all a marketing campaign.
305 2018-10-25 21:23:27 We are not at a bottom yet.  We need FAANG stocks (responsible for taking us lower) to find buyers in order to turn this market around.

309 2018-10-25 21:22:33 Getting alerts from Signal Trades, but not knowing how to cover both stop less and sell at profit price. No exchange let's you put 2 orders in, unlike stocks. How do you do it???
310 2018-10-25 21:22:15 Stocks climb, pulling the Dow and S&P 500 back into positive territory for the year - This has nothing to do with Joe Sixpack, or me.

314 2018-10-25 21:19:48 It’s not even my chart. And if you read you would see that my only point is that stocks go both up and down. Relax dude. No one is misleading anyone

319 2018-10-25 21:15:48 1/ Some thoughts on how recent market events affect small caps: 

Small caps have borne the brunt of the market selloff.  While the broader market is down about 10% from the August 31 peak, small cap stocks are down closer to 18%!

321 2018-10-25 21:15:11 @CramerClub Will the market action over the last week cuase the price targets to be revised in the weekly round-up? It seems to me the stocks can be downgraded from 1-2-3 but the PT's don't change. thanks
322 2018-10-25 21:15:04 Delusional democrats crying the sky is falling. When are gonna be in a WW3 again, or when is the stocks crashing? Btw, we are a Democratic Republic not a democracy and the left are the ones trying to destroy it.
323 2018-10-25 21:14:10 I haven't heard that either, to be fair. I am often dealing with patients who are used as a message courier from a certain pharmacy though; even with out of stocks, don't say you can't get it, tell me what you do have!

2 years ago: nah im gonna trade bitcoin. Stocks are crazy. 

Now: fuck man I got fucked on bitcoin. I tried pot stocks this year i got fucked 

Me: maybe do something else? This world may not be for you?
329 2018-10-25 21:12:32 They are not making money “hand over fist” or they wouldn’t be in billions of dollars of debt. Their profits may be impressive, but not compared to their balance sheet. And most of the success today is already well priced into these stocks.
330 2018-10-25 21:12:29 Totally agree, unless the Trump Company ever goes public! Bitcoin and pot stocks were the mania of this cycle.
331 2018-10-25 21:12:15 The "monkeys trading stocks"-story comes to mind. 
Ages ago I read about someone hooking a plant into a trading system in some way. It was beating the index of course.
332 2018-10-25 21:12:13 Hmm... I'm Indiv. stock focused and run longs vs. shorts etc...  But as far as Indices go, if solely based on FANG they will drop further.  If 100's of left for dead Uber cheap stocks come to life (circa 2013) we will see Indices make notably higher highs.
333 2018-10-25 21:12:09 I lost sleep last night because I was sitting on some big losses accrued over past week.  I sold 3/4 of my stocks into this ramp today.  Might be a mistake but I needed to

335 2018-10-25 21:11:29 Markets tanking after hours due to google and Amazon earnings misses/slowing growth warnings. This is what happens when the markets are too reliant on a handful of tech stocks to drive it forward. $GOOG $AMZN
336 2018-10-25 21:11:15 Adulting is too hard - I can tell you how to invest well into whichever funds and stocks that’ll give you a decent net gain in profit but I can’t iron my own fricking shirt to save my life.

341 2018-10-25 21:09:01 The sellers have realised that anyone can now go and buy the products in the diaspora and   come resale them.  Some of the sellers i think were holding on to their stocks or creating artificial shortages i dont know. But somehow seems SI122 has relieved the consumers.

346 2018-10-25 21:06:35 @cvpayne did you consider that maybebthevreason @amazon stocks dipped was because of right leaning people are leaving because of the left leaning owner?
347 2018-10-25 21:06:18 Let me guess. He's going to give drug companies their very own tax cut so they will temporarily lower prices to make him look good. Only the drug companies will buy back stocks and do the complete opposite.

353 2018-10-25 21:03:34 The economy is SO good that these stocks are going to fall another 50% ? Huh?
354 2018-10-25 21:03:28 I find it funny when stocks tank because it didn’t hit analyst outlooks $AMZN, really...it’s just an opinion, look at the numbers, for a company this size to still have this level of growth is impressive...
355 2018-10-25 21:03:27 Tough time for stocks huh 
356 2018-10-25 21:03:23 Difference is that the biggest weighted stocks fail on sales

358 2018-10-25 21:02:14 Tip - 
You’ll grow profit through Stocks and Funds combined. If you start out small, have a portion of your assets in dividend paying funds that are reinvested, your assets will grow while you sleep. Yes, I have bad days, but stay the course. I mix monthly & quarterly dividends.
359 2018-10-25 21:02:09 Cannabis is going to be bigger than Tobacco in the next 5 years.  Buy your stocks now. Or show me this tweet in 5 years when I ask you for money.
360 2018-10-25 21:01:28 jeez everybody had it wrong on $AMZN getting crushed AH - question is has $AMZN reached its zenith? can the stock regain 2k? - stocks like this can sometimes start massive sell offs...like $BLK
361 2018-10-25 21:01:26 Awesome 
362 2018-10-25 21:00:42 The exchanges don’t have nice features, like no dom’s or advanced bracket orders or trading on charts etc, like I was use to in stocks and futures platforms.  Most of these crypto exchanges you can’t even place a stop order on them.
363 2018-10-25 21:00:33 There are many that believe stocks have not bottomed out yet.  Could be more trouble ahead after full impact of tariffs are seen in the economy.  
364 2018-10-25 21:00:28 Im pretty sure ppl who enjoy “dank memes” do not fuck wit stocks

366 2018-10-25 21:00:05 Too true. We got smashed in there repeatedly because we couldn’t get first hands on the ball. Even still, when our tall stocks were at their lowest, they still refused to pick Campbell.

369 2018-10-25 20:59:20 Dear @realDonaldTrump why are soo many companies missing earnings in this very strong - 4% growth - economy???  Tech stocks down after reporting EPS tonight include $FLEX $WDC $AMZN $GOOG  Strong earnings were expected to stabilize the market, I guess not.
370 2018-10-25 20:59:19 Iran will make Lockheed-Martin, BAE, Raytheon, General Dynamics and Boeing stocks race. Predictable. So many jobs! 
Disgusting fact!
371 2018-10-25 20:59:16 What makes you think that? Bio stocks in general have been beaten badly and that could attribute to this decline.
372 2018-10-25 20:59:15 since I invested $10,000 2 years ago I've got 24,000 stocks so returning one won't hurt
373 2018-10-25 20:58:09 I couldn’t get out of $AMZN but bought 11/19 $1685 puts cheap so don’t have too far to fall ...working to get clear out of individual stocks and just trade the indexes until trump out of office
374 2018-10-25 20:57:57 Funny man, Caterpillar, for one, said their stocks fell because of Trump's trade war.

376 2018-10-25 20:57:05 You're totally full of it. Economic indicators show more revenue.  You probably said stock market would crash if Trump elected. We have added 7t to the value. If you actually had stocks you'd know that !!! Boom
377 2018-10-25 20:56:49 Ok cool..any idea or view other tech stocks like mongodb and elastic do fluctuates

390 2018-10-25 20:50:23 Just want to say this very clearly: Momentum stocks NEVER top out due to valuation. They top out when liquidity dries up in a material sense. Lack of buyers and lack of easy money top stocks out.
391 2018-10-25 20:50:03 i’m ... so embarassed by these ignorant af comments on the dropping stocks please please please try to read some actual news  other than that trashhole akp and realize this shit is happening all over the world and has to do with fucking trade tarrifs like good lord
392 2018-10-25 20:49:54 @ZachScheidt Don still cannot find a broker who will deal with penny stocks, out of country.
 2 teen drivers, what fun & frustration in one package. Take a picture after they get their lisenceso we can see how much grey you have at that time.lolol
393 2018-10-25 20:49:49 Yea  I read few stocks blog I find out it's a pretty shaky 4th quarter
394 2018-10-25 20:49:23 Agreed. "Miss" implies disappointed wall street analyst consensus. The same wall street analysts that constantly change their price targets and backfill a ratinale to follow a stocks price as it moves up/down.
395 2018-10-25 20:49:05 Stocks NEVER top out due to valuation concerns ... they top out due to liquidity on sell side (lack of buyers) ... and once that happens at a large enough scale to break key levels (as the monthly chart is doing in October) .. that liquidity drain will follow it down
396 2018-10-25 20:48:42 Agreed. I have seen so many people recently celebrating 50%, 100% gains on penny stocks with dollar-land in in their eyes....only to see two weeks later that same stock has gone back to where it started, or lower.
397 2018-10-25 20:48:32 But stocks "soar" when they beat deliberately lowballed estimates. Do you tweet that?
398 2018-10-25 20:47:55  Q3 had low interest rates....no China and tariff risk.....Europe was more stable...no minimum wage pressures...sexual harassment issues etc.......that was goldilocks.....this is now.....Q4....has many headwindsmarijuana as well as pot stocks may be a possibility
399 2018-10-25 20:47:10 Don't B stupid & B like the rest that knee-jerks. The stock always swings like this. There R reasons why the stocks drop, ex. incidents or news from other countries. U are ridiculous in blaming one dip on the president's actions. Research other news (other than CNN & alphabet)

You think with all these misses that Friday will be a RED day?
409 2018-10-25 20:43:22 my question is - which ones aren't down and why? understandably everyone wants to buy value when it has gone on sale. But is it rational to look at the stocks that haven't declined and think maybe there is a reason there are no sellers

Hello
Tesla had a great Q3 earnings but  it was usual of 10-15 % pop as most of stocks but It was not explosive pop like 20% or more. It was factored in from 260 dollars before earnings release.
431 2018-10-25 20:33:35 Also with an election two weeks off would not surprise me to see liberal hotshots selling short to attempt to get a run on the market to make Trump look bad.  Stocks are long term for most of us, day traders can cause havoc.
432 2018-10-25 20:33:16 @SlopeOfHope can’t have the two largest stocks in the two markets dropping and expect market to recover anytime soon. Really three goog and googl
433 2018-10-25 20:32:12 Seeing the result and after market activity for some of the Faang stocks, it looks like your other chart showing move upto 2600 is building up
434 2018-10-25 20:31:57 Trump says there’s plenty of new jobs. Many industries like farming and fisheries are hurting for workers because of the drop in immigration. And I’d rather my taxes help those people than the 1%ers and companies using them to buy back stocks.

436 2018-10-25 20:30:52 actually if you look at the large S&P biotechs:
AMGN: super conservative and just buys back stocks
BIIB: If they haven't bought anything big in 3 years, not sure I would count on them now
CELG: Already pretty leveraged, probably not going to take on debt for another big acq
437 2018-10-25 20:30:41 Bought $2,000 worth of puts near market close, and to see the stocks after market shit the gutter was beautiful.
438 2018-10-25 20:29:54 $AMZN just guided for revs of $66-72 billion. Analysts were looking for $74 billion on average.   Think about that hard if you really believe the economy is booming. #stocks #nasdaq
439 2018-10-25 20:29:47 Several strong beats after hours as well. I think it could be ok tomorrow at least for the stocks I'm in. We'll see.
440 2018-10-25 20:29:41 Remember when stocks for PBMs sank deeply after Trump's speech in May on the blueprint when Trump said he would eliminate PBMs or the "middlemen?" Then they quickly recovered.

To sum it up he does stocks and investing and he still hasn't splurged a lot of money and doesn't plan on returning any time soon

(Also the outro is great)
448 2018-10-25 20:26:30 I'm still quite short even after selling some - at least until it breaks the trend line. Look at $EFZ and $EUM.  They look like hot stocks breaking out of a base. Long both with lots of calls in $EFZ.

501 2018-10-25 20:12:36 World stocks ex Asia higher: US +1.9%; Europe +.5%. What would be normally seen as a great day for US stocks paled against yesterday's losses. A "dead cat" bounce in an oversold market isn't an unreasonable assumption. Short-term dangerous, long-term outlook still goods.
502 2018-10-25 20:12:21 That's for dam sure. Stocks are falling because of Trump.
503 2018-10-25 20:11:51 Stocks rebound but recoup only part of Wednesday's major losses.

Dow ends +401, +1.6% to 24,984 after -2.4% Wed.

S&P +1.9% after -3.1% Wed.

Nasdaq +3.0% after -4.4%

Stocks faltered in final hour as sellers got the upper hand. S&P had been up as much as 2.3%.
504 2018-10-25 20:11:38 Even though some municipal authorities had stocks of stable iodine, they were not distributed.
505 2018-10-25 20:11:16 By the way, stocks are up 400 today. This is why you never use the market as leverage when discussing the economy.

October me: "Hello is this September me? Yeah. That was a really terrible move you just made."
517 2018-10-25 20:09:07 Agreed, we are back to the start of the year levels, so I think everyone can pay there bills without liquidating anything.  I guess everyone thinks we are CRASHING in stocks so everyone will sell Bitcoin to cover losses and pay bills.
518 2018-10-25 20:08:49 4 stocks of mine had better than expected results..2 was amazing to almost unheard of great....all 4 stocks dropped after the report. Tells a lot about where stocks are right now

523 2018-10-25 20:07:13 Really, stating stats is being defensive? How so? Facts not feelings.
The miniscule progress made by Obama was a nothing. He didn't even do bump stocks, Trump has categorically stated he will ban those. There's only so much legislation can be done, I'd say we've hit that point.

525 2018-10-25 20:07:00 Boeing was one of the stocks people made a fortune on playing the insider information game with. We are cancelling the Air Force one order, no we aren't Trump windfall. That one was so obvious I even saw it.
526 2018-10-25 20:06:42 Not saying anything but in bios us longs always have an excuse for why our stock isnt doing well. Sometimes we just pick bad stocks. Not saying it’s that way w $lptx just saying that retail side of it isn’t really a good enough reason as of now imho. Bc of Data was so good
527 2018-10-25 20:06:35 What about failure bias spoke with a guy who sold all his stocks at the bottom of the market lost big time and said see don’t invest in stocks  or people who buy back investment properties and tell stories of losing money I don’t want to follow these guys advice

532 2018-10-25 20:04:28 It's different for everyone I guess but I rather have 3 to 5 years of the living expenses  cover rather then having a fixed percentage in stocks

544 2018-10-25 20:01:47 The Stock Market rebounding today. As I said yesterday, the stocks lead the sell off were all terribly overpriced.

551 2018-10-25 19:58:56 Kudlow is, as usual, horse pucky. Ultimately, healthy markets reflect earnings, not sentiment. The Feds efforts to normalize rates is regulating an overheated market, but Pinocchios trade policies are hurting forward earnings projections, and stocks which look 6 months out
552 2018-10-25 19:58:56 I wish article wasn’t on a Murdoch paper as I will not subscribe to read it. Did notice stocks took a dive yesterday. Expect to pay more for everything including taxes. GOP great at enriching themselves at expense of poor and middle class.
553 2018-10-25 19:58:42 Drug stocks up BIG.  Hehehe.
554 2018-10-25 19:58:26 There are 603 #stocks of the 1759 total in the Russell #Microcap Index down more than 20% year to date. The average decline of those stocks is 42.75%.

556 2018-10-25 19:58:04 No, our fishing industry is tiny and we can't be trusted to preserve fishing stocks. Look how the scallop farmers behaved last month. Additionally we don't eat the fish they catch, the need to be able to sell to EU.

579 2018-10-25 19:45:07 Yep, a miserable decade, all the dips of the US and slower recoveries, the TSX kinda blows. 65% of its listings are energy, financials, and materials, very little tech which has been a leader for US stocks, so we're pretty well tied to the price of natural resources.

588 2018-10-25 19:41:48 Well done if you grabbed some tech #stocks late yesterday. If you did not sell some of what you bought you are a pig!

592 2018-10-25 19:39:05 Yet things got better with president Trump. Record highs in our stocks and 401ks record lows in youth and minority unemployment. He brought North and South Korea to very improved relations, told NATO to pay fair share for military protection, manufacturing in US increasing.
593 2018-10-25 19:37:14 Yeah especially considering that defense stocks are supposed to trade on order back logs, which are at historic highs.
594 2018-10-25 19:37:13 I can see the bullish side of it but factored in with stocks dropping. Could cause a domino effect. I'm still neutral big picture.

605 2018-10-25 19:32:58 Markets Right Now: Stocks surge a day after a massive rout
606 2018-10-25 19:32:48 Great pullback today and I see some short term indications that the equities might find support around current levels. Anyhow, it is very hard to find stocks with intact base patterns and therefore I regard it to be very likely it takes weeks before a real bounce can take place.
607 2018-10-25 19:31:17 Trump's tariffs are hurting American companies and workers. Famers are petrified. 3M, Caterpillar, Ford and other manufacturers blamed his tariffs for rising costs/falling profits. Stocks collapsing on this realization. Nasdaq puked 12% in 2 weeks.

636 2018-10-25 19:20:06 I just witnessed two 14 year olds talking about stocks, what is this
637 2018-10-25 19:19:41 Hey ! Je n'ai pas plus d'info pour le moment, c'est une carte très demandée aux stocks limités, mais tu seras le premier informé par mail dès qu'elle sera expédiée
638 2018-10-25 19:19:24 Stocks are falling because anyone with a brain knows a crash is coming. A crash that was sped up by the GOP tax scam.
639 2018-10-25 19:19:13 For some reason, this calls to mind the Wall Street saying about really bad stocks bumping up a little after a sharp drop. Its called the Dead Cat Bounce, because even a dead cat will bounce a little if it falls far enough.
640 2018-10-25 19:19:11 First new trade in 3 weeks. I have sold some shares of my stocks to include $AMZN for tonight ER ( all because my brother @JavierSanz is all the time telling me to buy for tonight ). My portfolio now : 43% $AMRN 20% $AMZN 20% $FNKO 17% $SENS. Just pray for us 
641 2018-10-25 19:19:07 What does anyone need a semi-automatic rifle for, other than firing at people? Same with bump stocks.

643 2018-10-25 19:18:38 Hey @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP growth for WHO??? Growth for your wealthy cronies, that's who!!!

Stocks are falling because trump is a very poor businessman who's running our country like one of his businesses. A poor businessman who's gone through countless bankruptcies!!!
644 2018-10-25 19:18:21 Bones skinless chicken breast, tuna, egg whites, broccoli, and oatmeal. Occasionally rice bc it takes forever to go through that, but you rarely see the with protein powder bc everyone stocks up when they're like a third off. That alone pays for the membership. 
645 2018-10-25 19:18:15 It's called being prepared. and stocks are doing quite well!
646 2018-10-25 19:17:16 He wants a ban on semi automatic rifles, that is anything but supporting the 2A. Bump stocks aren’t an issue if you understand bump fire you would know you can’t ban that. Background checks are a dog whistle for registration no thanks!
647 2018-10-25 19:17:01 IMO they saw how $TLRY went to the moon and now are probably buying MMJ stocks before they legalize so they can make a killing. Once the US legalize it'll go crazy again
648 2018-10-25 19:16:37 The time frame reflects a negative 20percent return in the first few years for stocks.  And you’ve had decreasing interest rates for almost that entire 19 year period except for this year and a couple blips.
649 2018-10-25 19:16:32 Bullish! Buy stocks

651 2018-10-25 19:14:56 Except he is. All of his policies still follow the 2nd amendment, he just wants common sense gun policies like background checks, removal of bump stocks, and taking guns from people who are unsafe to have them until they are safe again.
652 2018-10-25 19:14:20 You're gonna scare one of my teachers shitless! He just told us today that he went blank when Brexit was announced cause he's waaay into stocks. Whoopsie.
653 2018-10-25 19:14:11 This would contradict  what every financial periodical and textbook have shown for as long as I remember. Stocks return around 11.%vs 5-5.5% for bonds.  What kind of witchcraft is this chart using?

655 2018-10-25 19:13:36 every loss could be called a burn job. a learning experience on how to play what types of stocks, what cap of stocks vs. what exchange they are on. I've had a learning curve not to play cse, usa otc bb, cdn otc bb, usa pink sheets even had dabbled a small cap in hk.

659 2018-10-25 19:12:50 And where did he get that money for the buy back of the stocks from Trump and McConnell's tax break for the rich. No raises firing the employees, yes that's the way it works and with the extra money you buy back your stocks and get richer. Liar Trump liar McConnell. Vote blue

664 2018-10-25 19:10:01 So you're proving that you don't know anything about modeling, pricing of stocks and fixed-incomes. E.g., the dependent variable in any such analysis is not "it happened before."
665 2018-10-25 19:09:45 #stocks  Are the nervous Nellies and scaredy cats  in the Federal Reserve and other central banks intervening to prop up a failing world  economy ?

Dow +1.9%, Nasdaq +3.3%, S&P +2.3%.
673 2018-10-25 19:08:20 Time to get back into buying stocks .
674 2018-10-25 19:08:12 Drug company stocks are up, even after having been leaked many of the details earlier.
675 2018-10-25 19:08:10 That's rich. They are grabbing at straws. The stocks are falling due to different factors. Tariffs are one of them. Overseas stocks have fallen. There are no winners in trade wars. That's why leaders have avoided them, like the plague, since the Depression.
676 2018-10-25 19:06:54 Material gifts are cute and all but imma need y’all to buy me stocks from now on. I’m tryna increase my net worth.
677 2018-10-25 19:05:56 Due to recent extreme volatility, I highly recommend the SEC rethinks all ETF's tracking highly unstable assets like stocks and bonds and concentrate on less risk and more stable asset classes like #cryptocurrencies and #Bitcoin especially. 

When $BTC ETF?

688 2018-10-25 19:02:48 i don’t have the temperament for volatile stocks
689 2018-10-25 19:02:28 No. So far we just have sandwiches, salads and wraps for actual food. The rest are snacks and drinks, but the guy that stocks the stuff for us says they'll be changing things up every once in a while.

691 2018-10-25 19:01:54 Hi @SwanseaMarriott 

Have you sorted your table decorations and crackers yet for your forthcoming Christmas functions ?

We still have limited stocks of a few ranges and would love to come and show you. Let us know if we can help. 

Best wishes.
692 2018-10-25 19:01:37 Rush simply meant that the Right  prefer bump-stocks instead of random killing devices.
693 2018-10-25 19:01:11 I wouldn't make any bets on Chinese stocks, since foreigners can't own actual shares. Might pay off, or might be nationalized. Chinese ex-pat investor friends avoid Chinese stocks. Especially in this trade climate.

698 2018-10-25 19:00:49 If you keep it, the company gets all the money but your stock drops. If you 'pay out', each share gives (in this game) 10% of what you earned to the players. The more your payout, the more the stock rises.

(A stock round/phase is mostly just buying or selling those stocks.)

700 2018-10-25 19:00:19 Actually we already have this issue except it comes in the form of asset prices in stocks and real estate.  Some don’t see that as a problem but it is. It’s at tolhe root of populist anger. Unfixed it gets truly ugly. Buy #bitcoin its honest money.

703 2018-10-25 18:59:32 Let’s put it this way: market hanging on for results of 2 stocks tonight. That’s a 50/50 at best with the current set up
704 2018-10-25 18:59:30 $BBBY made a few moves in last 24 hours. First outlook has been downgraded to BBB-. (Nearing Junk). Second...Earnings moved til 1st week in January which is NEVER a good sign  #Stocks #Business #JumpShip
705 2018-10-25 18:59:00 Recent #volatility of stocks demonstrates that #riskyassets are driven by expectations and manipulation. True value is as elusive as catching the wind.
706 2018-10-25 18:58:47 Heading into the winter with the lowest #naturalgas inventories since 2003. The sector is dead with some stocks at all time lows. There is potential here for a price spike over the next few months which would be a catalyst for the sector. Keep it on watch

713 2018-10-25 18:56:50 We lost 100K - took some cash and bought stocks we’ve been looking at that also dropped. It’s also an opportunity if you’re prepared.

720 2018-10-25 18:53:15 Completely oversold. If you have some extra money aside might be a good time to buy stocks
721 2018-10-25 18:53:12 Yeah, I think it has to do with weakness in emerging markets and contagion risks. By the way, if you're right and rate on 10-year goes above 3.5%, it will kill emerging markets and stocks and usher in a new disinflationary/ deflationary wave which is ultimately bullish for bonds.
722 2018-10-25 18:52:54 Dow +500 but only while UST10yr flat at 3.13%. Stocks can NOT handle higher yields.
723 2018-10-25 18:52:19 What a wonderful story! We continue to learn from our past.
724 2018-10-25 18:52:15 It's not really a coop. these are still loans that are convertible into company stocks governed by shareholder agreements and (most likely) Delaware corporate law.

735 2018-10-25 18:49:21 Even the KOSDAQ was shaking yesterday and also other companies reported a loss in their stocks.

745 2018-10-25 18:45:09 (1/2) The model I like to sort of simplify the notion of what goes o­n in a market for common stocks is the pari-mutuel system at the racetrack... a pari-mutuel system is a market. Everybody goes there and bets and the odds change based o­n what's bet.
746 2018-10-25 18:45:02 @morningmika Rest assured the same WALL ST. TRAITORS who took the stock market down yesterday made money "shorting" the stocks they took down and now are making more money going "long" on those same positions. Not rocket science, just GREED!

774 2018-10-25 18:38:09 $brk.b at $202.83 is a great one to look at.  The team has a ton of cash and is putting it to work via buybacks, stocks, etc.
775 2018-10-25 18:36:52 I would recommend watching trash talk add flipping over buying stocks. You can make far larger returns on small amounts that way. Then look at options if you're looking to make quick cash in the market versus protect wealth long-term.
776 2018-10-25 18:36:28 i know, so many stocks -- now or never. Gooo!

779 2018-10-25 18:34:56 We’ve already got control of our waters up to the 12 mile limit. The UK has the 2nd biggest tonnage landed in the EU. Upon Brexit we can extend 12 miles to 200 miles, but UN law says we have to protect fish stocks. We can’t overfish. More Brexit bollocks I’m afraid.
780 2018-10-25 18:34:37 choice for that environment.
Strippers are in an amazing position to become independently wealthy through budgeting, stocks, real estate as well as creating startups and other businesses.

781 2018-10-25 18:34:31 Agree, but if stocks move down I don’t believe bitcoin will head higher.
782 2018-10-25 18:34:27 Yes sir.... very helpful....it would be great if you can also add the difference between the price of the stocks and the difference to the highest and lowest VWAP as per your presentation.... thank you...
783 2018-10-25 18:33:43 @InsiderBuySS hello, how are you, I have a question do you pick most of your stocks from Investors  Business Daily and are you a swing trader?
784 2018-10-25 18:33:15 Trump speech on drug pricing appears to have little detail on policy. No impact on drug stocks.
785 2018-10-25 18:33:05 Mitch McConnell and the top republicans want We the People to invest in our own retirement through unsafe unprotected financial investments Stocks and (401s). If you go broke too bad live in a cardboard box.
786 2018-10-25 18:32:42 I'm stuck on the sidelines watching... If VIX drops way down due to market bouncing back. I'm going long VIX. If market crashes, I'll wait to buy into stocks of my choosing after the wreak
787 2018-10-25 18:32:40 Yup. They need to teach about financial planning, credit, bank accounts, savings accounts, annuities & budgeting. Instead they teach about the stocks & bonds. Most Americans don't have either.
788 2018-10-25 18:32:38 @jimcramer was right. Airline stocks are doing great.

790 2018-10-25 18:31:25 Hi. I live in Australia and was wondering if Trump has an explanation as to how he wiped 9.5% off your stocks this year. I ask because it is affecting our market as well.......
791 2018-10-25 18:31:02 Yes.. currently backtesting this strategy. It has been almost a month since I am backtesting this strategy for all the stocks that come out after filtering this data.

798 2018-10-25 18:29:10 Having watched international coverage of the Brazil election, I honestly think that had this market-obsessed media been around in the 1930s, huge analysis would have gone on around what national socialism's economic policy was and how it might effect stocks and share values.

813 2018-10-25 18:23:46 Thanks, I ask this beacuse I have seen so many traders who don't recommend to short stocks on the long term timeframes. Under any circunstances and I don't know why.

828 2018-10-25 18:18:04 Those who have seen 2008 are puzzled right now. In 2008 index stock fell 70%. Today index stock fell 70% but index down only 15%. Maybe those stocks will be available for free if nifty falls 65%.

838 2018-10-25 18:15:10 Depends on your timeframe. For me personally this is not a bear market and far too early to short #stocks. But I am trading my own approach and this is different to yours.
839 2018-10-25 18:15:06 The problem with @CNBC and Liesman et al is when they say "market" they mean stocks. @pboockvar is trying to tell them the Fed should be paying weighted attention to credit markets.
840 2018-10-25 18:14:53 The rich primarily make their money from their stocks and since the return on investments is way higher than the growth of the economy it’s means people who are living on paychecks haven’t seen their income rise much while the 1% have seen their wealth drastically rise.

861 2018-10-25 18:07:52 There is no true price discovery with this managed market. Stocks are overvalued, driven by debt, buybacks. Tesla's revenue parallels its debt. Fake market. But profitable.

867 2018-10-25 18:06:48 The stock market is a giant slot machine. I see numbers rolling, and the casino jingle as my life savings goes down the drain every day. All of my mutual funds are taking major losses, my stocks are way down, and massive losses in 2018 trading. Terrible year.
868 2018-10-25 18:06:48 just wait and see...we'll see how the stocks go after the election.
869 2018-10-25 18:06:10 and the consequences are: tax cuts for the rich and corporations, no trickle down to workers but buybacks of stocks, artificial inflation of stock market, greater risk to environment, threats to cut SS and Medicare, increased consumer pricing due to tariffs=volatile stock market

874 2018-10-25 18:04:15 Splits, theoretically has no bearing on market cap. However, in practice, the REASON to have splits can be bad/good. Forward splits are generally good. Stocks generally go up a little after (euphoria). Reverse splits are usually views as bad (as the REASON is usually bad).
875 2018-10-25 18:04:01 Stocks must be held for 5-10y. Some disappoint but diversified portfolio does well. Take help of advisors

891 2018-10-25 17:59:50 Then you should see hdfc securities pick of the week stocks every time.
892 2018-10-25 17:59:46 Two stocks dont ensure returns, i also don't know which two will definitely do well
893 2018-10-25 17:59:41 In addition I observe some large cap leading #stocks. They are looking bad, too.
894 2018-10-25 17:59:27 @safalniveshak Dear Sir - How should long term investors strategize in this market? Even in value investing, should we reduce our positions given the market sentiments/uncertainity etc., so that we can re-invest in these stocks at cheaper levels?
895 2018-10-25 17:59:15 Another bad sign: I have only very few #stocks on my #watchlist. All of them are strong, but show volatile price action. None of them are showing a setup.
896 2018-10-25 17:57:05 A 7.4 that fits TM stocks perfectly !!!!
897 2018-10-25 17:56:26 Oui on avait déjà partagé l'offre. Sauf que maintenant il n'y a plus rien en fait. Tout est épuisé un peu partout et ce sont les derniers stocks qui étaient à des prix indécents ces derniers temps.

Tracking stocks for now. You can check uranium if you'd like. 
Last trade was buyinh $qnt when it was some 40ish cents.
904 2018-10-25 17:52:52 Part of it has to do with the time of the year. If you look at the history of stocks they general cool in October, just prior to the run up for the holiday sales and stay that way until numbers get released.
905 2018-10-25 17:52:22 The bond market sets the price action of every other asset, stocks included. And as I said, this will continue until it doesn't. We trade the market we have.
906 2018-10-25 17:52:17 complètement inutile vu qu’il n’y a aucun moyen de le comparer à Big Hit. Sachant que toutes les entreprises cotées à la KOSDAQ ont vu leurs stocks diminués autour du 24 Octobre, c’est qu’un événement en Corée qui n’a pas de rapport direct avec la Kpop
907 2018-10-25 17:52:08 running false negative ads isn’t a good campaign strategy! What are you doing for healthcare? Why are you against pre-existing conditions? What about sensible gun legislation and bump stocks and universal background checks and Your A rating from NRA?
908 2018-10-25 17:52:05 If you mean budgeting and understanding loans and interest, yes, but if you mean understanding stocks & bonds, no.

919 2018-10-25 17:49:18 @POTUS at the very least, needs to audit the Federal Reserve. By raising interest rates they are manipulating the markets to drive stocks down pre mid terms. Anyone confident of a red tsunami might see a buy opportunity during the next 10 days.
920 2018-10-25 17:48:43 Great tv news item ! Good luck all.
921 2018-10-25 17:48:20 Stocks are on a huge, and are 50 points from being in the red. You sure you wanna die on this sword?
922 2018-10-25 17:48:17 I've made some money on my stocks too.  Doesn't mean I'm going to sell my soul and vote for a devil.   I don't understand this. I"m a New Yorker and we have always known that Don is a Con. Thanks for trying to get another blue voter.
923 2018-10-25 17:48:02 The more people that buy yellow labelled goods, the more they'll produce and sell because supermarkets stocks things that sell well. Obviously I'm not suggesting you buy up all the stocked yellow label goods of course.
924 2018-10-25 17:47:23 Elon stop. I invested in your stocks mate my money is on the row
925 2018-10-25 17:47:19 Real income is down, stocks are flat, and #tariffs are about to kick in and start inflation rolling.

Oh, and you've got us in debt up to our ears.

927 2018-10-25 17:46:26 #ES_F has a large offer sitting at 2707.00-ask: ~ 2,000.  Is it real or a spoofing program? #stocks #options $SPY $ES_F #futures #trader #sp500 #emini
928 2018-10-25 17:46:08 I’m listening to my coworkers talk about professional sports and all I can think about is what if they debated real estate like that. What if they knew stocks and futures like this. How much further ahead could we be???
929 2018-10-25 17:45:49 If people buy more tinned goods (not all the tinned good obviously) then supermarkets would get greater stocks of tinned goods in - they're always monitoring buying patterns.
930 2018-10-25 17:45:21 So tesla stocks go up
931 2018-10-25 17:44:44 How to increase stocks 101:
932 2018-10-25 17:44:37 “Perhaps more ominous is the market’s track record The last 2 times the pendulum swung sharply between dominance for value & growth stocks occurred around 2 of the most dramatic implosions inthe stock market’s history:the 2000 dot-com crash & the 2007 onset ofthe Great Recession”
933 2018-10-25 17:44:31 Buying yesterday’s close was the easy money, folks. Take your profits if you did the same. A lot of volatility to come. I do think better to be long than short overall here. But don’t be a pig if you listened on yesterday’s close! #stocks
934 2018-10-25 17:44:25 $SEED and $ALT are interesting stocks to have on the radar.
935 2018-10-25 17:44:10 #Nifty trading below 200 DMA . All 50 stocks of #Nifty are trading below 50 DMA. Bears are in full control now. Wait for pullbacks to create more shorts. #TradingTips #November
936 2018-10-25 17:43:40 stocks rise by 1%.
937 2018-10-25 17:43:12 I may have bought 140 stocks of @Blizzard_Ent today. You know, before BlizzCon... AND YOU SHOULD TOO!
938 2018-10-25 17:42:57 Actually, 
It's bringing out cryptocurrency on a small door throughout projected recession in two and half cycles from now via instability of other currencies.
Stocks go down.

Forex goes down.
US dollar weaker over euro (1.15-1.35).
Gold in 3 years  50% up.

939 2018-10-25 17:42:32 Maybe so, but I believe it's also true that Ben Graham's books tend to sell well in bear markets.  People start getting religion about what things are worth.  #stocks #valueinvesting
940 2018-10-25 17:42:26 Hold onto stocks. If you sell now, you might lose all your investment. If you bought ar price inflated by bull market speculation without looking at residual value/dividends or evaluating price/earnings ratio, fire your broker! 401K’s at risk, if their funds managers are cons.
941 2018-10-25 17:42:04 But sir worked on two stock , Ambuja and jubilant both ended in loss after result announcement . But I got profits with same strategy on diff results stocks 5 days before expiry

943 2018-10-25 17:41:45 The mantra for success in stock markets is to keep it simple, invest regularly and hold for the long term. Some factors effect the stocks only in short term, news & events, volatility in global markets, political views & changes etc but....

948 2018-10-25 17:39:05 The Treasury Dept received ownership stakes in auto companies in exchange for bailout money and the Treasury recouped almost all bailout money when the stocks were sold after the industry stabilized.

955 2018-10-25 17:36:51 A witch's brew of indecision and disorder as DJT is being repudiated as a clown and a fool. . The economy looks more like a Mad Hatter's Tea Party with central bankers, panicky fund managers. and the nervous rich trying to save tech stocks from being hollowed out by investors.
956 2018-10-25 17:36:14 Do you think we are entering a bear market in stocks? Thanks!
957 2018-10-25 17:35:25 Most companies fiscal years end in October. Stocks usally go down in the third quarter based off the revenues in select markets, which in turn affects other markets. Good Stocks, usually rebound. All dependent on what type of stocks you have.

987 2018-10-25 17:24:03 Smart way for emergency liquidity is to have a line of credit instead of parking cash in a savings account. You can liquidate investments gold or stocks and bonds pretty quickly before you have to pay interest in the line of credit.

I’m in Scotland UK, have purchased the PP ultimate fire truck for my sons 4th Bday on 2 Nov, spent 2 months trying to find the pups in firefighter uniforms, in stores & online no one stocks them!! Do they exist? Got ultimate action pups as short term substitute!
1006 2018-10-25 17:15:08 Agreed. The administration isn’t being held to their commitments/promises. Instead, the media runs stories about how successful Trump has been. 

Why isn’t anyone -EVERYDAY- asking about Trump’s promise to issue an Executive Order banning bump stocks? He said he would fix it.
1007 2018-10-25 17:15:06 Hopefully you sold all your stocks and stopped contributing to a 401 or IRA. That will be a great peaceful protest against Trump economy. But wait isn’t Obama taking credit for the economy? Then this report is misleading.
1008 2018-10-25 17:14:47 Put that 1k in stocks
1009 2018-10-25 17:14:32 @realDonaldTrump says we should excuse #MAGABomber terrorism, journalists hacked to death, his #TrumpCrimeFamily looting the country...because of our 401k

Stocks are back where they were in January, companies are leaving, inflation is rising...so #Republicans, what else you got?

1022 2018-10-25 17:09:25 Yep, the stocks are going to crash significantly. Some of my friends took their money out last week & are quite happy now.
1023 2018-10-25 17:09:21 The question is, how many of @realDonaldTrump hardcore base own any stocks, either individually or through retirement accounts, or pay attention to the stock market?
1024 2018-10-25 17:08:55 It seems you are one of the Typical Retail Investors whom people like we LOVE because you are the guys who make the Top.

1028 2018-10-25 17:06:42 As Wall Street opened on Thursday, stocks bounced and recovered from the previous day’s sell-off. This was helped by some stronger quarterly earnings from the likes of Microsoft, Tesla, and Twitter.

1035 2018-10-25 17:05:18 1. Stock Market moves ahead of earnings. It works on Demand - Supply. The Top of all the Stocks you mentioned has already been formed. The earlier you understand it the better it will be for you.

1039 2018-10-25 17:04:29 Right. The way they stood up to DFO scientists trying to tell them the Eastern cod stocks were going to collapse. That's what we need.

1079 2018-10-25 16:51:03 C'est du dumping. C'est une technique utilisée par les grossistes qui jouent avec les stocks volumineux. L'intérêt est de maximiser les ventes pour gagner des incentives chez le fournisseur. Certains vendent même à perte avec ça.
1080 2018-10-25 16:50:51 Lol, you like to buy stocks after they crack the 200 DMA? You like the FED rate hikes? You realize there are several choices here right? Long, Short, or Cash on Sidelines?

1084 2018-10-25 16:47:18 Thanks Roger.  Would be great if all companies put their AGM's online like Fundsmith.  Slightly worried that #SLS is running highly rated growth stocks hard but they have a quality bias.  Higher fees than #BRSC.  If you had to buy one smaller companies trust which would it be?

Nifty & Next 50 is 23% of portfolio. Gold is 11, Stocks & MF 51. Rest liquid fund. M trimming MF since late 2017 & slowly started going direct into stocks & some in Index. Is this ideal allocation for 10-15y + ?

1097 2018-10-25 16:44:08 Stocks going down doesn't mean alpha is disappearing. Alpha can be achieved via spread bets, stocks selection and shorting. In both stocks and other asset classes.

1140 2018-10-25 16:34:17 If stocks finished the year at yesterday’s prices I think you could argue workers/renters outperformed investors/homeowners in 2018. First year of the cycle you could say that.

1144 2018-10-25 16:33:45 Also, Neil I think you argue that growth may not pick up enough to offset the rise in discount rates associated w/ higher rates. But I think it's fair to also argue certain sectors are actually saying growth will slow and possibly decline e.g. autos and housing related stocks.

1156 2018-10-25 16:29:08 common critique I make of "rates up, stocks down" but tbf, Neil addresses that

"story might be different if investors believed higher growth would feed disproportionately into higher corporate profits. But the current economic moment offers plenty of reason to think it won’t."

1159 2018-10-25 16:28:40 Rakesh Jhunjhunwala recently simplified that India has 7-9% GDP growth, 5-6% inflation = 12-15% nominal growth over the long term. Hence a diversified basket of stocks should easily be able to manage 15+% earnings growth over a very long term. Agree?

1169 2018-10-25 16:27:10 It is also a big risk on stocks, so realistically SEGA delaying is a big risk with a possibility of a big reward in the end.

1170 2018-10-25 16:26:34 though to be fair its more logical to remove funds from the tail end of a bull market (stocks) than in the depths of a bear market (crypto)

thats what i would do, but i'm not normal

1283 2018-10-25 15:51:57 No, if you would read the articles, it clearly states that Investors pulled out of SM stocks because they realized SM cant replicate BTS success.

1309 2018-10-25 15:45:05 Agreed, the risk adverse are least suited to invest in individual stocks for long term gains — a sector-based mutual fund may be a better (more comfortable) fit.
1310 2018-10-25 15:45:03 Your article compares price to earnings ratios. The most flawed way to analyze and compare companies. That is not how stocks are priced. Stocks are priced using growth rates as well. Your article does not mention growth even once. You're comparing apples to oranges.

1321 2018-10-25 15:41:10 Yeah, stocks will do that. Up and down.

The thrust of my point is banning UK fish from the SM (and therefore theoretically losing access to UK waters) would have a huge knock on effect, not just to European fleets but Norway/Iceland fish stocks and of course EU consumers.
1327 2018-10-25 15:39:18 Just ask him how his stocks are doing today.
1328 2018-10-25 15:38:51 Stocks are regaining some of their losses so far this morning.  MBS is left unchanged and Yields are up to 3.13%.  Mortgage Rates are left unchanged as a result from yesterday's Rates.
1329 2018-10-25 15:38:39 Like this is fucking Bloomberg, not your local news station. Bloomberg who's a source for all business industries who is known to cover mostly stocks, so this writer probably has access to all the current business news. This source is being written in my textbook as valid source
1330 2018-10-25 15:38:38 Heads up:- 
1. Knowledge is Power
In addition to knowledge of basic trading procedures, day traders need to keep up on the latest stock market news and events that affect stocks – the Fed's plans for interest rates, the economic outlook, etc. Do your homework.
1331 2018-10-25 15:37:01 Gas is high af. Stocks went down death threats shit wild out here man
1332 2018-10-25 15:36:44 Cared enough to reply. Someone said all company's stocks are dipping and I clarified not bighit tho so understand the conversation first
1333 2018-10-25 15:36:21 I hate when y'all confuse having stocks w being financially stable. They're non liquid assets.  U don't always know what their worth is. AND....most of y'all just say it to sound like u have something
1334 2018-10-25 15:35:49 who gives a shit, I have so many photographers and they send me photos and videos galore, anyone who has issues about shadowing misses the main point that I'm traveling the world and trading/teaching from everywhere so stop being petty and get back to studying
1335 2018-10-25 15:35:32 Yeah, but he’s also talked publically with senators (cameras rolling) that he’d consider a number of gun control issues (EX: gun show loopholes, bump stocks, red flag laws, etc) and then caved under weight (and $) of the NRA. No regs or legislation pushed by his admin on those.
1336 2018-10-25 15:35:14 To prevent sadness, don not look at how your stocks/retirement is doing today. Try again in a few weeks.
1337 2018-10-25 15:34:48 US stocks holding solid gains. No bounce in EUR or Cable as US yields rise.

1340 2018-10-25 15:34:37 Markets are up today - tomorrow who knows? Extremely volatile. LONG term investors with cash, dollar averaging Index ETFs likely (IMO) a good starting point at the end of October over many months. Not ALL at once. Invest same DOLLAR amount each month. NOT for individual stocks.
1341 2018-10-25 15:34:33 Amazon and Intel to come after the close. US stocks take another leg higher. A very strong start

1346 2018-10-25 15:33:51 3 stocks with RS lines at new highs right now are $DG, $ORLY, and $ULTA. Not sexy names, but their resilience during this correction is noted. Put them on your watch list now, bc they could move IF we can get a new FTD or uptrend started.

1352 2018-10-25 15:32:45 I look for a potential bounce. I monitor some stocks buy placing them on my screen and every certain moment  I look  at my screens and see is the stock is running up slowly from big pullback. I pay attention those stocks that ran previously in the last 5 days.
1353 2018-10-25 15:32:41 The USD rally clearly linked to the bounce in stocks

1362 2018-10-25 15:31:09 I was hoping for a little more pain heading into Black Friday. I figured another 3-5% down, then 10% up by end of year and I'm doing 2x for 2018. Then should be a decent 2019. Not sure it'll happen. Thinking of getting back into some oil stocks I got out of in June....price + div

1388 2018-10-25 15:23:43 The great thing about international exposure during this cycle is the diversification it gives your portfolio. When US stocks go up, international stocks go up less. And when US markets suffer, international markets surrender.

1393 2018-10-25 15:22:57 #3- Ripple the company did create xrp the cryptocurrency but they don’t “own” it or control it.

1397 2018-10-25 15:20:37 Trump supporters were warned over the last couple of years since Trump inaugurated @what was going to happen with stocks, etc. Just the beginning- It will get worse.

1398 2018-10-25 15:20:13 Stocks did well during the Obama Administration but no gains this year. Maybe the actions of the Trump Administration brought an end to Democratic "pro-growth policies."
1399 2018-10-25 15:20:06 Well said,  that's all true. However, there are safer vehicles with decent rates of return. The wealthiest investors largely avoid speculation in favor of consistent returns. I wouldn't recommend stocks for many people. Not that anyone should listen to me!

1418 2018-10-25 15:14:56 Being a full time trader does not mean trading all the time. Use the time to STUDY charts, understand correlations between how stocks react/move to certain types of news/filings. Learn & observe plays.

Nothing replaces experience, so put in the screen time! Learning never stops!

1425 2018-10-25 15:13:50 There is a sell-off in the stock market. We are just a fool, selling and buying, selling again when stocks are going to hell and then buy it back when heaven starts to smile. Believe me folks, only God can make a tree.

1434 2018-10-25 15:10:16 So I was totally right that we need to learn how and when to average! And again never sell on panic! 90% of traders losses is related to their bad time in buy and sell ! Please remind your self always trading stocks is a high risk capital investment no matter is the stock!
1435 2018-10-25 15:10:06 Hey trump voters, ask yourself, are you better off than you were two years ago? Having full control of government has given you a right Supreme Court, and a tax cut most of you didn’t feel. Stocks are tumbling, gas@is higher, and no wall. Think about it, and vote blue.

1447 2018-10-25 15:05:20 I feel like there is a malaise- like an epidemic over the country #TrumpMiseryIndex must end!  High gas prices, high interest rates, inflation, unimaginable cruelty, lies, plunging stocks, most division since Civil War, and the horrible feeling waking up that he's still in office
1448 2018-10-25 15:05:16 The 600 point drop in the Dow yesterday wiped out stock gains FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR. And Trump is now on a rampage to blame it on the Fed chairman. Hmmm.... a scapegoat for when his own voters turn on him (even though they don't even own stocks)? Irony inside another Trump riddle.

1478 2018-10-25 14:58:33 I believe TheRealBiff is saying that as a narcissistic psychopath, Trump blames others for everything because his fragile ego doesn't allow self-responsibility.

1499 2018-10-25 14:52:39 Its not about hedging against the stock market... very few people are worried about a stock market crash.  It is about short term return chasing while stocks take a breather.  Thats why new money could be right around the corner.
1500 2018-10-25 14:52:37 @VohiCapital not a proponent of blatant writing but what do u mean by iv when u use bnf or stocks as its not vix so it may not be a very accurate thing to compare hist vol to atm or straddle iv also atm iv can be of 2 dte option while vix is fixed to 30d

1540 2018-10-25 14:43:46 5 am for stocks where your time spent with family would been less. Now utilise this period to spend more time with them. Only human relationships matters nothing else. I know this since i am not able to devot time to my kids fully becaz most time is spent on office  and stocks.
1541 2018-10-25 14:43:30 It's not about volatility, but value. Stocks are overvalued and need a steep decline. Bitcoin already had its crash and provides a better value now.
1542 2018-10-25 14:43:13 What may be the reason for price not getting increased even with good delivery..I had few other stocks like that where delivery was more then 90% but price was in range..

Who owned that com?
1571 2018-10-25 14:37:05 I get your point but, To drop bonds and stocks you have to have a buyer as well as a seller so someone would still own them.

1602 2018-10-25 14:29:50 What i am saying is.  Now that the stocks are going down (mainly due to the feds interest rate hikes) its trumps fault.
1603 2018-10-25 14:29:39 I do... Stocks were undervalued before the sell off. Corporate profits are soaring, expect lower double digit growth next year for them, and the economy is growing 3%+. Looks like a great time to be adding.  Interest rising due to a strong economy.  that's a good thing.

1675 2018-10-25 14:08:53 Exactly.  A real 5% return on stocks is something everybody should be happy with.  You just need to be able to stomach the big gyrations that occur and hang in there.

1701 2018-10-25 14:02:42 I'm with Brooks on this one. Back in the era of QE, Fed buying extra Treasuries pushed rates UP rather than DOWN (and stocks rallied) because the market saw that as stimulative. On 10/3, Powell spooked the markets with Hawkish verve.

1714 2018-10-25 13:59:47 #Stocks Strategy: If you’re young, dollar cost avg & for each 5% dip, say, add more. Retired or close: have a cash bucket to cover 1-2 years of expenses so you can ride out a downturn. Note: defensive sectors playing to form: Since 9/20 peak, utilities +4%; staples -0.5%
1715 2018-10-25 13:59:37 Whether you sell your business or stocks before you die or right after you die, you still have to pay capital gains tax.  Correct?
1716 2018-10-25 13:59:21 The stock market is falling, 40 % of the S&P is already in a bear market. Look at homebuilders, the housing stocks, the financials, the retailers – all these are the same things that were happening in 2007 leading to that crisis. But, we dont learn.
1717 2018-10-25 13:58:51 JRM is only interested in keeping his tax loopholes - his funds ( along with Redwood's and Odey's ) short UK stocks and Sterling - he is betting on a downturn, it will make him richer..but you poorer. You have been duped
1718 2018-10-25 13:58:31 Interesting because yesterday the ‘tech’ stocks took a big hit!  Reuter’s & AP used to hold my greatest confidence but no longer.

1732 2018-10-25 13:54:46 The markets fell again, with the S&P500 shedding 3% — meaning that it has erased its gains for the year. The tech-heavy @Nasdaq fared worse, losing 4.4%, as semiconductor stocks endured some of the biggest sell-offs of the day. Overnight, Asian stocks followed America’s lead.

1758 2018-10-25 13:48:32 LONDON (Reuters) - European and U.S. futures markets attempted a rebound on Thursday after Wall Street’s worst day since 2011 and heavy losses in Asia gave global stocks another boot towards their worst month since the financial crisis.

1779 2018-10-25 13:45:18 Not good, bombs all over the u.s. from a crazed person,a president not caring...stocks crashed yesterday again,feeling fearful.
1780 2018-10-25 13:44:54 Stocks opened with a triple digit gain at the bell, but those gains are fading. The DOW erased all its yearly gains after yesterday's bloodbath. S&P is also negative for the year & the NASDAQ is now in correction territory. We start at 10 @TFEShow @WRKO680 @95wxtk @WTAGradio
1781 2018-10-25 13:44:41 When I go to my local track, I love to see Modified, late models, sportsman's, mini stocks, and sometimes NEMA midgets, legends, etc. I'd like to see a variety at the top levels too. #TMDNASCAR

1783 2018-10-25 13:44:25 Stocks are falling because: 
- Trump attacked the Fed causing a crisis that will harm the Fed's ability to do their job with credibility
- Global growth prospects are dimming as 25% trade war tariff looms
- We did nothing to help shrink #USA national debt and instead exploded it.
1784 2018-10-25 13:43:57 Stocks are on sale today!
1785 2018-10-25 13:43:28 $GRCU - Was doing some research and found this Cannabis Retail Distribution Company.  I have traded OTC stocks many times and profited - $GRCU is a good short to mid term Trade IMO @cannabis @stocks
1786 2018-10-25 13:43:16 via GerberKawasaki: Stocks start higher after a large selloff. Markets need a solid bounce to break this correction.  Earnings have been good. Microsoft and Tesla leading the market higher. $msft $tsla $tsla
1787 2018-10-25 13:42:50 In an election year midterms or Presidential October is always volatile. Unfortunate. Never buy stocks in October.

1795 2018-10-25 13:41:11 If a movie star earns $10m a year, with $5m left over, and invests it all in stocks, then dies the following year, isn't the bulk of the estate made up of previously taxed income instead of capital appreciation?  YMMV.

1796 2018-10-25 13:40:36 No deal!

They can manipulate a 401k to their benefit too. They need to keep their hands off and use a 3rd party to manage their stocks.

1798 2018-10-25 13:39:46 Stocks stop dropping plz
1799 2018-10-25 13:39:37 Ha. I worked in brokerage early in my career and remember how many times people bought the wrong stocks on their own - wrong ticker, etc. Expensive mistakes.
1800 2018-10-25 13:39:23 $acb stocks fall after they get a permit to ship cannabis to Poland. #pricemanipulation
1801 2018-10-25 13:39:17 Sadly many of those, who have no stocks, and did not benefit from Donald, will vote for him still
1802 2018-10-25 13:39:17 My guess, is that they just don't give a shit about anything. @fornation set this up to fail either because of his stupid nature where no matter what the situation, good or bad, if a Liberal did it, he needs to destroy it ... or he's shorting Cannabis stocks.
1803 2018-10-25 13:39:15 I have a question @PressSec I watched your press conference where you touted we should be talking about Trumps accomplishments. Please let me know what those are. Stocks are down, tax cut was a failure, healthcare being threatened. Trade deals are as good as proclaimed.
1804 2018-10-25 13:39:12 $SPY 1.79% boost will blow stocks through the roof 10AM awaits

1806 2018-10-25 13:38:48 Can you ban semi automatic weapons and bump stocks too because a life is a life.  Those are weapons that kill in large numbers and also terrorize families and communities.  Don’t be a hypocrite!
1807 2018-10-25 13:38:44 No time to panic, Asia stocks down... Dow opens higher.... regain losses
1808 2018-10-25 13:38:31 I always wondered if you had already tested your strategy with stocks
1809 2018-10-25 13:37:27 How’s your portfolio look today? Stocks plummeting, food rotting in silos and other corporations like auto manufacturing / tobacco go under due to tariffs. You are at the end of the food chain...but the costs of Trump’s greed will hit you eventually as more and more dominoes fall
1810 2018-10-25 13:37:10 Transportation stocks have become the latest group to fall into correction territory, a potentially ominous sign the downturn that has swept major indexes in October could intensify.
1811 2018-10-25 13:36:58 Tesla now in position to pay off debt obligations, shares up 8.5% #tesla #stocks #nyse
1812 2018-10-25 13:36:40 How are the stocks doing? You haven't praised how well you're, ahem, they are doing.
1813 2018-10-25 13:36:37 top 5% of US taxpayers pay 60% of US taxes.  Those arent all cash wages, but are heavily driven by stock options & restricted stock, which is taxed as ordinary income by IRS.  IOW, if Fed keeps tightening while foreign CBs arent buying USTs, stocks wont rise so neither will wages
1814 2018-10-25 13:36:34 Even beer stocks aren't safe bets anymore?  Say it ain't so.
1815 2018-10-25 13:36:23 $VRUS Is an extremely fundamentally sound OTC company. We need pressure on the buy side of this equation to get this stocks valuation in a more suitable range for the business we currently conduct. We are grossly undervalued.

Management = A++
Revenues for an OTC = A++
IR = A++
1816 2018-10-25 13:36:22 So I did hold on to $TWTR has it never fell to my sell point it's roaring back after earnings. #stocks #investing
1817 2018-10-25 13:35:10 Bullish or BS?  This is why Musk wanted to take Tesla private. So the believers would stay with him and the sideline sitting Twittersnipers would go away. Drive other cars. Invest in other stocks. Obsess on someone else. That ER was stellar. Tesla is going to $1000+. Wake up!
1818 2018-10-25 13:35:08 Yes total agree..many people trade successfully having only few stocks in their watchlist with MSExel ready or only pivot and they don't use hardcore TA in that n some are even not aware about that...Sahi all three stocks have given signal very early but lack of attention..
1819 2018-10-25 13:35:03 #US #stocks open up

1822 2018-10-25 13:34:33 Before you join us you gotta get yo stocks up
1823 2018-10-25 13:34:16 Will we get bounces in the markets such as the one  starting today? Absolutely, but the BULL MARKET is OVER. And stocks will  eventually enter a full-scale CRASH as the world experiences its first  real bout of deflation since 2008.
1824 2018-10-25 13:34:14 The key to buying overbought stocks is to know when to exit. Stocks can remain overbought for a long time and suddenly surprise you.

1825 2018-10-25 13:33:49 Omfg I posted this exact thought on my Facebook. A while back after watching a Netflix special called explained. On how the Republicans were creating false profits with the buybacks of stocks in their own company to raise their own pay. And that after it would do this to market.
1826 2018-10-25 13:33:42 but the base don't own stock only the the middle class 401's and if that don't make them mad nothing will maybe  when or 401 goes to ZERO it might do it. Another GOP idea to get stocks up.
1827 2018-10-25 13:33:35 That’s true Jeff. Our economy is going well. Hopefully stocks will bounce back soon. Perhaps I should by a lotto ticket 
1828 2018-10-25 13:33:17 Many stocks is available now at 6 pe n 2% dividend yield isn't it a opportunity...
1829 2018-10-25 13:33:08 Think of this meltdown as stocks playing “catch up” to economic realities.
Those are the economic realities of a slowing global economy, a deflating housing bubble as a result of Fed rate hikes, and a trade war with #China.
1830 2018-10-25 13:32:50 you are going to trade penny stocks
1831 2018-10-25 13:32:44 The small amount of stocks that we do own as pensions would normally have voting rights attached to them. However, private pension providers make you sign them over to them, refusing you the voice that your money paid for through the purchase of these stocks.
1832 2018-10-25 13:32:35 Mini crash scenario mitigated a bit with the higher open, but certainly not off the table. Bulls want stocks to snapback and stem the tide today.
1833 2018-10-25 13:32:18 Nahi bhai. Stocks le lo. This is the best time.
1834 2018-10-25 13:32:17 Been trading oil stocks for 20 years. SLB dropping to these levels is very extreme.
1835 2018-10-25 13:31:51 Earnings misses and weak guidance lead stocks lower premarket

Junk stocks are rising!!
1838 2018-10-25 13:31:26 @Varneyco @cvpayne - The business channels have turned into a stocks weather channel. Just like the weather the stocks are erratic gyrating up and down every other day. The stock business pundits conjure and speculate as to why but no one really can say. Is it climate change?
1839 2018-10-25 13:31:17 We know you go to great lengths to divert attention from the crises you create, but as a diversion from stocks tanking don't you think this bomb stunt is a bit much? Even for you?
1840 2018-10-25 13:30:57 At least get it right. 
I called Tesla below $100 by 2021 when the stocks was $360
Stand by it 100%
Along with my Facebook call to $165, $149 and then sub $100 when the stock was $188.
1841 2018-10-25 13:30:03 #crude stocks 34.554 mln bbl below year ago levels. Refinery operating rate at 89.2% vs 5 year avg of 86.98%. Still some bullish fundamentals despite the build #oil #gas #OOTT
1842 2018-10-25 13:30:00 The fact riskier assets such as stocks and commodities are moving in unison as the market selloff deepens is a worrying sign for some analysts, who think more turbulence lies ahead.
1843 2018-10-25 13:29:56 $SPY up but pot stocks gapping down. This is good. Didn't want another gap up like yesterday. Would still be stronger if $SPY were down too and then turned.

1847 2018-10-25 13:28:45 I figure the stocks I bought at the bottom the last time that happened will let me retire 2-3 years earlier than I had originally planned.
1848 2018-10-25 13:28:19 I need to make more money ASAP, I’ve been watching these stocks for a while and I literally know when they fluctuate. Like if I had 10k to invest I’d be fucking LOADED. Gawwd. I’m pissed. The stock I am watching went up 10% and I knew it was coming!!!! Why am I broke!?!?
1849 2018-10-25 13:28:07 @adamlashinsky surprised there was no mention of @Tesla record quarter and pop in pre-market trading in todays datasheet, especially with all of the highlights of other tech stocks and the lead in story re: MSFT

1863 2018-10-25 13:24:35 Sir, Mean reversion means an entity entering into its normal state of equilibrium. Every correction has multitude of reasons. After LTCG, market went to All time High in August. Why did anybody not talk of LTCG then?And why should Gov favor Stocks over Real estate(20% LTCG).
1864 2018-10-25 13:24:06 How’s the rest of the market doing?

Do you think stocks operate completely independently of each other?

I could destroy most of your points but I’m already bored after page 6 of 12.
1865 2018-10-25 13:24:04 Stocks move deeper into red zone, Sensex crashes 344 pts
1866 2018-10-25 13:23:47 Stocks fell because enough people today believed that some of the stocks they own are not worth as much as they previously thought they’re worth.
1867 2018-10-25 13:23:45 hey let's get at it and give the market more and more - screw the savers - so the last 10 years nothing but ZERO interest - and the stocks surge at our expense - then a couple of rates hikes and now the savers have to pay again -  and don't forget the deficit!!  pure  GREED

1875 2018-10-25 13:21:05 Well, if they don't agree that it's bad behavior, i.e. you haven't persuaded them of that, then they'll keep it from you. It reminds me of the ZERO people who turned in their bump stocks after they were made illegal.

1882 2018-10-25 13:17:02 ETF is exchange traded fund. It's like a mutual fund but it trades on the stock market directly. State Street is one of the big sellers of ETFs.

I don't own any SS nor affiliated with them. But ETFs are a good way to invest in a basket of stocks. That's all this ad is about, lol
1883 2018-10-25 13:16:58 Markets don't always have to be rational but that is what creates opportunity. Oil stocks (smaller the better) are at extreme levels right now.

1890 2018-10-25 13:13:01 Crypto would be seen as a high risk investment for a traditional investor. So if they're pulling money out of stocks, they're not gonna move the money into something as seen as having MORE correct. The best thing for crypto would probably be more of a sideways securities market.

1913 2018-10-25 13:08:50 Michigan Twitter stocks to watch:

@sbell021 and @ItsAntWright are blue chips and should be in everyone’s portfolio 

@LGhail is a very solid stock with strong dividends 

@EUpchurchPhoto and @NateLewis77 are high growth shares with a very high ceiling

1923 2018-10-25 13:05:02 @foxandfriends @gop @cnn Panicked Republicans promised lower drug prices. Had 2 years to do it and did nothing. Now seeing massive mid term losses. Desperate. Expect stocks to plummet today.
1924 2018-10-25 13:04:17 I was at 100% stocks in 2013. Made a gradual shift to 90% stocks/10% cash+bonds+CDs throughout 2017. I'll probably stick to 90/10 for a while, but make a feeble attempt at "timing" to go a tiny bit more bonds or stocks if things get really high or really low.
1925 2018-10-25 13:04:01 Oho.. I thought you lost something in stocks..  
1926 2018-10-25 13:03:38 RT if you lost money yesterday with the stocks market dropping.

1928 2018-10-25 13:03:06 People try to defend themselves y they don't buying or having fmgc stocks ...Value or overvalue ...Gdp double in next 6 to 7 years...Is this correct...
1929 2018-10-25 13:02:57 When the stocks dropped during Obama's presidency Trump said if the market falls that low the president should be impeached.  His words not mine.   What does he think now
1930 2018-10-25 13:02:50 If stocks were a lock to outperform, they would already be priced in at some obscene high price, flatlined. Companies come and go w innovation and competition disruptive chaos, makes the market volatile. Investors able to ride out investing broadly LT have been the beneficiaries.
1931 2018-10-25 13:02:46 I see it!!! Im sure I know why the stock market is tanking. Look at the stocks that are crashing hardest and why. Three reasons investors are constantly bombarded by negativity about DJT and the market by the msm making them extremely risk adverse. The fed mucking with rates. And
1932 2018-10-25 13:01:47 Haha on voit que tu es tres mal informe  les new stocks entre d’un jour a l’autre...informe toi mieux !
1933 2018-10-25 13:01:04 Like many $TSLA shorts, I am predominantly a long investor with a love for growth, a dislike of pollution, and a significant background in tech stocks. It's not about "hate", it's about questioning the business model.
1934 2018-10-25 13:00:54 Even that won’t work. The stock replenishment systems are all automatic, bar codes read at checkout, stocks levels deducted, automatic re-order. The distribution depot might just have a million on a shelf. 1 of 2

1936 2018-10-25 13:00:22 May we have your comment on this? "The S.&P. 500 down more than 3 percent amid run of selling that has wiped out all market gains for the year. Stocks have fallen for 13 of past 15 trading days, including 3.3 percent drop on Oct. 10 that was market’s worst fall in eight months."
1937 2018-10-25 13:00:21 No @larry_kudlow. That’s dumb & irresponsible. Stocks are dropping on the heels of dumb, unpresidential rhetoric by @realDonaldTrump @POTUS about Saudi murder & cover up, and economically insane tariffs. Add to that Trump’s scapegoating about the this week’s spate of mail bombs.

1939 2018-10-25 12:59:37 With me seems like death  thousand cuts.  Everyone has their eye on demand,  what about  brewing cost spikes  labor, input, imports, and borrowing.   Rates  effect  stocks, earnings,  and demand.  Fiscal  Balance Sheets are a  mess.  Best similairites estimate - 1970s stagflation
1940 2018-10-25 12:59:34 when stocks were up, it was because of the tax cut. now that they're down, it's because investors are afraid of the blue wave. iron logic.

1997 2018-10-25 12:37:06 @jimcramer Understand u saying when stocks fall like they r doing now that good opportunity to buy into a good Company. However if u have all your portfolio in markets then u have no money to buy in as U r all in already. So u hv tobride the wave.

2006 2018-10-25 12:33:32 Yes you can prepare.  It is time horizon for investors First, then risk tolerance in creating portfolio allocation.  As the market grinder higher a slow shift away from stocks to bonds is the right strategy.  U can’t pick the top, but you can slowly capture gains on the way up.

2016 2018-10-25 12:31:30 Hope investors don’t rush in for ‘bargains’’. A cheap stock could be a worthless stock and there are more than a few of such stocks. I’m looking at many of these penny stocks and thinking a penny is too much as management are just bleeding the company.

2024 2018-10-25 12:27:14 I’ve never once said stocks always go up. Do I think it pays to save your money and invest? Yes. What’s the alternative?

2028 2018-10-25 12:25:46 There are plenty of traditional portfolio managers recommending 1% crypto exposure. 

Now if 1% of the money in stocks fled into crypto.....

You do the math.

2031 2018-10-25 12:25:07 As I'm currently looking at it, #oil is the best buy for the next 6 months. If stocks go up, oil will follow. If stocks crash, oil will make a bubble. Win win. $CL
2032 2018-10-25 12:24:46 You shouldn't own stocks if a 50% drop in their value in a short period of time would cause you acute distress. No one can tell you when these will happen. The light can at any time go from green to red without pausing at yellow. Temperament matters; not IQ. 

-- Warren Buffett
2033 2018-10-25 12:24:16 So we should continue to have unfair trade and have IP stolen just to prop up stocks.

2037 2018-10-25 12:21:42 The Wolf of Wall Street, Jordan Belfort, didn't make his millions selling stocks to large savvy investors but people like you hypnotized by the promise gold. EVERY buy decision (including politicians) is motivated by greed or fear. Logic is then used to rationalize the purchase.
2038 2018-10-25 12:21:26 @stocks_worth_watching I'm in ttnp and just giving my thoughts
2039 2018-10-25 12:21:04 Stocks are falling because it looks like anarchy is winning, and Trump is the flame that stokes it.
2040 2018-10-25 12:20:47 My universe is ~ 3000 marginable & optoinable stocks over $3 & 100k ave volume. may be why my New Low numbers aren't reacting same?
2041 2018-10-25 12:20:43 WA pace stocks are seriously deep. Missing Coulter Nile, berehndorf and Paris, for various reasons, who are all Australian quality quicks. Their depth is outstanding
2042 2018-10-25 12:20:23 Nothing four hours in the stocks outside Worthing Town Hall wouldn’t sort out.
2043 2018-10-25 12:20:18 Es posible sí, pero como bien dice @Magyar4Steven no siempre los resultados acompañan a los movimientos... dejemos decidir al mercado y actuaremos en consecuencia...
2044 2018-10-25 12:20:05 I try not to think of stocks as "favorites" - makes it harder for me to change my thesis when necessary. But $MDGL has great data.. and $VKTX shot up 96% in May when it came out - so it's had a positive effect on my portfolio

2048 2018-10-25 12:17:23 It's becoming near impossible to find Vegemite in London  First @EAT_17 on Chatsworth road stopped selling it, and now it seems the @waitrose in Barbican no longer stocks it either  What's a  in  to do?
2049 2018-10-25 12:17:09 I am not calling using crypto as a hedge. In my opinion the trick is how interesting is BTC and alts right now where a long has a nice RR.

So I can see traders using a very small percentage of their gains in stocks in crypto to keep some high risk assets in their portfolio
2050 2018-10-25 12:17:07 Recently I published a blog post about the IPO market and someone asked for additional insight on what it signals. My response to that question is below: 
IPOs are when stocks come to market and are available for the general public.
2051 2018-10-25 12:16:35 Darn democrats! They deliberately sold off their stocks because soros sent a secret message to democrats only, ordering them to sell.
2052 2018-10-25 12:16:09 What’s chanded? Democrats do not want open borders, stop listening to @foxandfriends. Stop with your lies. Vote blue in your state so we can get our democracy back and stop the lies. Stocks down, all gains lost, republicans taking away ACA, Medicare/Medicaid, wages flat.
2053 2018-10-25 12:15:54 This is what I have been telling you for months...and you were mentioning some kachra stocks. Long way to go.

2056 2018-10-25 12:15:01 After leading the market higher most of the year, tech stocks in general are taking on the chin rn. And chip stocks in particular, as demand from mom & pop crypto miners drops off... nice trade.

2060 2018-10-25 12:12:57 If I understand it, Obama needed to get the credit for rising stocks but Trump gets the blame for falling stocks. Right?

- Still no answer to the middle order and finisher gap
- MSD has to go, need another bat
- a full strength WI would be scary

2063 2018-10-25 12:12:26 nah. Mainly because the DOW is pretty much a worthless number. It contains only 30 stocks and they'll swap a stock out if it's not performing. It's design to go up over all.

It looks like the big players are rushing to open the door for institutions to come in, I suppose they realize there is a great chance generating big bucks by setting up bitcoin as a hedge against stocks, this is opportunity of a life time.

2067 2018-10-25 12:10:43 Investors like to lock in their gains by selling "winners", stocks that have appreciated since they were purchased, and hang on to their losers.

Unfortunately for them, recent winners tend to do better than recent losers, so individuals sell the wrong stocks.

2071 2018-10-25 12:08:55 Cheerleading, or pointing out that there are a lot of sudden bargains out there?  Your 20 percent factoid seems to make that point....I was reading Dorsey Wright yesterday and the smallest cap stocks have been hit the hardest.
2072 2018-10-25 12:08:54 The @federalreserve rate hikes may be blamed for the #StockMarket correction, but the #Fed isn’t tasked with lifting #stocks or making politicians happy. #economics #finance #investing
2073 2018-10-25 12:08:52 "About 353 S&P 500 stocks have fallen 10 percent or more from their 52-week highs. Of those, 179 stocks have fallen by 20 percent or more from their highs, establishing them in a bear market by many investors’ definitions."  This correction has been ongoing for a while now
2074 2018-10-25 12:08:50 Asking for your thoughts:
If we see a big rebound in Stocks during the coming weeks, would Crypto rebound too?
2075 2018-10-25 12:08:29 Just wait another six months or so until after the earnings from the financial crisis drop off. Even if stocks go up they will be cheaper according to this measure
2076 2018-10-25 12:07:59 You are  F@#KING INSANE. IT IS CAUSED BY YOUR RACIST COMMENTS.  IMPEACH him the stocks are tanking.
2077 2018-10-25 12:07:56 Stocks are still a sale and this rally overnight is a Bears wet dream
2078 2018-10-25 12:07:36 As expected, all the clueless media clowns are now blaming FED for the plunge and asking to end the rate hikes. Remember these are the same morons who told you little while ago that stocks usually rise during rate hikes. Market is not falling because of the rates its the earnings

2093 2018-10-25 11:58:50 I'm guessing the same place as before. I get your concern Danny but these "project fear" concerns are getting out of control. Do you really think that the powers that be in the UK and indeed globally would deliberately allow medical stocks to run out?

2100 2018-10-25 11:56:31 #Stocks,#Indexes UPDATE: ALL NDX AND SPX MODELS exhibit either completed or emerging-and-about-to-complete BOTTOM signals.  AS ALWAYS, we wait for COMPLETION. This means waiting until at least 1000 because that is the first datapoint. The first half hour does not count.
2101 2018-10-25 11:56:22 This implies that he doesn’t know why stocks go up. Let that also sink in

2107 2018-10-25 11:54:30 I feel like he did pretty good job for a sec, but the real numbers are coming in. U.S. stocks fell last Thursday as weak earnings reports from industrials raised worries over rising expenses and the impact of tariffs. I fear that things are about to get really bad.
2108 2018-10-25 11:54:11 Happy Birthday! Is it the stocks in "setting up", in "underway" or in both? Is it charted as # before open or after close?

2113 2018-10-25 11:51:33 Ironic, too that I was slowly heading underwater on all my long term stocks, the only money I made was on the intraday punts. Time to get out before  I do something even more stupid.
2114 2018-10-25 11:50:37 OUCH! AMD have suffered like many stocks in October, down 30% in the last month.

2119 2018-10-25 11:48:37 Catipillar and 3M stocks dropped because they both said while sales increase about 1.8%, raw material costs raised faster than sales, caused by the tariffs, causing a net profit drop. 
Great 2nd quarter numbers were caused by companies pre-ordering items to beat tariff increases

2139 2018-10-25 11:38:20 Unemployment is creeping back up, home sales are down, home builder stocks have tanked, companies are using their tax breaks to buy back stock rather than employing more people or giving current workers benefits.   - the deficit is the only thing that's booming.

2144 2018-10-25 11:36:27 Hey moron, the mkt was at 19.6 when he took office, if you knew anything about stocks it has done quite well during @realDonaldTrump administration. Still way up.
2145 2018-10-25 11:36:25 No I’m not in any “big caps”, or Binance alts for that matter. Btc looks weak, stocks look shit, those coins get rekt too easily. My only major positions are XHV XTL DACC TFD and DERO. All in profit (some free bags).
2146 2018-10-25 11:36:24 Sell at beginning of a sell off. Not at the end of it.   Individual stocks may be unique. Overall picture will be marvelous if R retains congress.
2147 2018-10-25 11:36:20 Although the technical details of QE:s of the Fed and ECB differ in some aspects, they do fundamentally the same thing: increase liquidity. Where the artificial liquidity has gone differs, however. In Europe, it had largest effect on bonds. In the US, stocks and cap. flows.

In the UK if you invested in the FTSE 100 20 years ago your investment has gone nowhere.

Do you entertain this as a serious possibility for the US indices going forward and if not why not?

2172 2018-10-25 11:26:38 Asia stocks have joined a sell-off after a bruising session on #WallStreet which saw 2 of the 3 main indexes erase their gains for the year. Tokyo stocks slumped more than 3%, while losses pushed the #DowJones Industrial Average and S&P 500 into negative territory for the year.
2173 2018-10-25 11:26:02 That's one way to discourage stocks to be traded, especially if stocks are bullish, to avoid creating a bubble that can result to a market crash.
2174 2018-10-25 11:25:23 So stocks go DOWN when fed raises rates? One of the best measures of @realDonaldTrump's policies has been the stock market. Its still much better than in 2016 when he took office. BUT the #Fed raised rates how many times under Obama? 1 I think, since 2016? 7 times. #NotPolitical?

2190 2018-10-25 11:20:14 Let me get this straight. Obama said he helped get this economy going up. But when the Stock drops, It's Trumps economy. So.. If the Stocks go back up (Which it will), then is it Obama's economy again? Hmm. #Liberals want it both ways. #MorningJoe

2216 2018-10-25 11:03:10 It's when stocks ratchet down like this that you buy them at prices that will boost future returns. Doesn't make it easier to stomach in the short term but it helps to keep that in mind

2224 2018-10-25 10:55:21 Stocks are falling because foreign investors who make up about 40% of investment no longer see the US as a good investment due to instability/lack of leadership. Also they know the upcoming austerity is going to wreck the US consumer base. Plus, consumer debt is at all time high.

2261 2018-10-25 10:38:07 Oh sorry! SA (Stock Advisor) & RB (Rule Breakers). I thought that's what you were referring to in the purchasing every month idea. They are stock idea services that both recommend two stocks each month. Anything I can do to help, you know where I am! 
2262 2018-10-25 10:37:42 Stocks plunged and left the S&P 500 and Dow negative for the year. Tech stocks have been the weakest, and the NASDAQ is now in correction territory. One analyst says different uncertainties are stressing people out. Meanwhile, SEARS Holdings has been de-listed from the NASDAQ.
2263 2018-10-25 10:37:29 $SPX stocks futs $ES_f +0.7% this a.m. helpful for thinking yesterday’s low, in light of positive divergence in $VIX & $NYMO, enables a good “B wave” rally. Some cycles experts have a time window from here to Monday, give a little leeway for that; but I’m cautiously optimistic.
2264 2018-10-25 10:36:59 Offers & discounts from sellers are until stocks last and due to the overwhelming response to the sale, sellers have ran out of stock of the items on offer. Sorry! -Sagar
2265 2018-10-25 10:36:31 Mr Market it’s biopolar to quite Ben Graham. Ignore it’s daily tantrums and stick to stocks that has a growth story.

2271 2018-10-25 10:34:31 Pretty shocking how $TSLA has run over the shorts.  Goes to show how difficult battleground stocks can be for true believers on either side.
2272 2018-10-25 10:32:29 2 schools of thought. Stock market keeps dropping. No spare cash to splash around with. Oorr... day traders need a place to make money. Stocks cant. Crypto or alts green. People going to jump ship. Money is money.

2274 2018-10-25 10:31:03 Yesterday the stock market lost all its gains for the entire year. How's your 401(k) doing? Supply-side tax cuts don't work because the rich just invest  the money in risky stocks, causing bubbles that eventually burst, bringing the whole economy crashing down.
2275 2018-10-25 10:30:55 Peak margins of last year make this highly cyclical stock APPEAR cheap.
Investing in cyclical stocks is a difficult art form
2276 2018-10-25 10:30:40 The kind of stocks Mohnish Pabrai has invested in, he is not going to get out anytime with any profits.
2277 2018-10-25 10:29:59 The only way I see some speculative money coming in is if we crash down to £3k and find a true bottom. If stocks going into a full bear market. A small % of portfolio money may come in as speculative on a market bottom but maybe not until Q1 next year
2278 2018-10-25 10:29:46 Can the DOW actually be green today? So much potential in stocks, so little growth.

2287 2018-10-25 10:25:19 Have you checked if your #VRS shares are held with a broker that will loan them out? If the answer is yes, consider transferring to a provider that doesn't, such as @HLInvest's Fund and Share Account or Stocks and Shares ISA. Don't let shorters get their hands on your shares 
2288 2018-10-25 10:25:18 If by mistake this is anyway repeatation of 2008 (which even I dnt know )

2290 2018-10-25 10:24:42 It's certainly partly the fault of government policy, but I think any government would be struggling given the factors involved: housing stocks, lack of integration between local authorities, lack of integration between public services, welfare budgets etc.
2291 2018-10-25 10:24:21 Sell off? Market rout?
US Large Growth stocks are up 26+% over 1 year.
5 yrs annualized return is *17%*, 10 yrs annualized return is *14%*. What else do you want? It is very likely that this is as good as it gets!
2292 2018-10-25 10:23:47 Not yet sure it's going to affect Nov 6th midterm. But stocks (US and Asia sharply falling) could become real political hot topic.
2293 2018-10-25 10:23:36 Sigh. No. Govt policy allowing buy up of quotas is to blame. And declining fish stocks and unsustainable destructive fishing methods have played a part. We sell much of our catch to the EU. Leaving the single market will hurt. A lot. But  carry on with the silly anti EU myths

2379 2018-10-25 09:31:52 The latest hit to the Asia's battered stocks was prompted by sharp losses Wednesday that wiped out top US indexes' entire gains for 2018. The NASDAQ down more than 4%.
2380 2018-10-25 09:31:36 Let’s see early days .  99.5 monthly support and 101.8 daily chart support were my DM’d view . Below that I’d be concerned . I got them back in 102s as on other stocks in sector . Stop losses on . Risk man and position size are key .

2396 2018-10-25 09:15:08 Central banks are buying stocks and bonds. They issue currency, buy stocks and bonds.  

Price discovery is absent from markets. The only thing that matters is what the central banks do.

2461 2018-10-25 08:35:12 The other thing that's rarely mentioned is that the smaller UK fishermen sold their quotas during the '80s & 90's as stocks diminished, requiring ever bigger boats. It's parallel to farming where smaller farms have been gobbled up by conglomerates

2488 2018-10-25 08:03:01 It's Mean reversion. Do you think stocks at 30-40-50 times earnings was normal? Every correction will have one or the other reason but the natural to expect is that there would be a mean reversion to GDP nominal growth rate.

2513 2018-10-25 07:46:26 Value destruction in Banking stocks (with no sign of immediate recovery to make good the lost ground) is not good for the system, which will erode the confidence on macroeconomic fundamentals; this is the theme that keeps investors confidence down & appetite low; need resolution!

2515 2018-10-25 07:45:33 It's the difference in opinion that moves the market, right now someone probably is converting their portfolio to cash and there is also someone who is reverse mortgaging their house to buy stocks.
2516 2018-10-25 07:45:13 If what you say is true that NCPB would buy stocks at 3600 and then sell back the same stock at 2000 to the traders, millers, it's not beyond imagination that possibly the maize never left the trucks,..

2546 2018-10-25 07:15:44 Agreed, but in bear market value erosion happens to the extent of 90 to 95 percent of the value. We are still far away from that. 60 to 80 percent fall which has happened in some stocks is due to fake valuations which they were getting. More of pump and dump kinds.

then again, if you did THAT, they'd have an easier time dealing with reality...
and your stocks might plummet

2622 2018-10-25 06:32:30 The speculation of value on cannabis stocks is out of wack. Loosing 20% of value after legalization should been a really eye opener for those that this could bitcoin all over
2623 2018-10-25 06:32:16 I completely disagree. I expect the Aussie banks to trade somewhere between zero and single digit share prices. I also expect that China will not continue consuming 50% of all of the worlds resources. When that happens mining stocks will wipe out most of their gains since 2002.

Stocks are already way oversold nearterm amd desperately in need for a bounce or deadcat bounce. this bounce could be huge.

2628 2018-10-25 06:28:25 #LarryKudlow knows that this is not true. Stocks are down because of ten year note interest rises, rising inflation, decrease in home building, stagnant wages, tight labour market and fears about the trade war with China. Polls show Reps are getting more early ballots in than Dem
2629 2018-10-25 06:28:04 generally, the U.S. stock market over-grew this year, so the mkt is just correcting itself now, cos their economy's growth rate is slowing; amidst other negative events around the world... this is the best time to buy the fundamentally-sound stocks, since their prices are falling

2632 2018-10-25 06:24:56 Stocks are falling cause of the incompetent person in the WH
Their tax plan is a scam

Because no one is bothering to give raises or even raise minimum wage
I feel like I'm leaving stuff out
2633 2018-10-25 06:24:46 I feel this market dip is just a correction mechanism...tech stocks grew too much this year and became over-valued, banks aren't growing their mortgage & other loans well enough...
2634 2018-10-25 06:24:38 "nifty below 10,150" A bear market is the best thing that can happen to any stock market. All bogus stocks are weeded out. Good stock become available at just valuations.

2637 2018-10-25 06:22:50 No, it is the opposite in stock, if you are bullish on stocks you are hated by the Anarchists & Libertarians, it's hard to understand why, my best reason is they hate private companies doing well.

1. Sell my stocks and pay 24% taxes then hope prices haven't rebounded by the end of november (or am buying them back in 2 weeks and paying 37%?)

2. Raising taxes on people in the form of tariffs is good for USA

3. Republicans win the house

2644 2018-10-25 06:17:43 If $AMZN were to crash the same way $TCEHY has plummeted this year, it would hit $1250 from current $1664. US tech stocks can keep falling for a long time.
2645 2018-10-25 06:16:51 Indian shares resumed their decline as an equities rout that wiped out this year’s gains for U.S. stocks spread to Asia, pushing a regional benchmark deeper into a bear market. The expiry of this month’s domestic derivatives contracts later today is seen adding to volatility.
2646 2018-10-25 06:16:10 @Heres_My_2_Cents @Stocks_All_Day I wouldn’t be able to tell. Just overall down

2648 2018-10-25 06:14:18 I talked to a financial adviser. He says - "Stocks are fuelled by greed, hedges are fuelled by fear." If Crypto is fuelled by fear, then the big money from the stock market will hedge there.

2655 2018-10-25 06:10:15 fter a slump in U.S. stocks, Asia’s main equity gauge has finally succumbed, entering a bear market overnight. The region’s equities have already lost more than $4.9 trillion in value this year, and Thursday isn’t looking pretty.
2656 2018-10-25 06:09:40 So much winning.. ;)
So I wonder if those stockowners are happy... ready to vote for 45 now that their stocks are down?

2700 2018-10-25 05:38:54 The stocks have risen but the drop has caused a lot of loss, the share prices were cut in half and it’s going to take almost a week full of plus raise in index to get balanced. . Plus the drop was stipulations only, as economic policy was ambiguous and clarity has now helped.

2740 2018-10-25 05:20:23 $WYNN looks attractive at RSI below 20 and short ratio around 2, same  $LVS. But gotta look at the future. how soon Paradise Park and MSG Sphere will pay off? In any case, these are portfolio manager's stocks, not trader's. Who needs them when there's $VTVT nonsense outthere? :)

It took 5 1/2 years before the stocks market again reached $14,000 in early 2013.   So the "buy and hold" strategy isn't always the best strategy.

Professional sellers and corporate executive have been dumping stocks at record pace despite good earnings  If stocks don't rally tomorrow, it's an awful sign
2792 2018-10-25 04:54:46 @ThirtySix I never short stocks. It’s a pain in the ass, just like you are. And the short term returns aren’t enough. I trade puts.

2804 2018-10-25 04:47:46 10/24/18
The sell-off in U.S. stocks accelerated, wiping out gains for the year in both the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, as mixed corporate earnings and weak housing data fueled anxiety that rising prices will crimp economic growth.

2810 2018-10-25 04:44:03 If anyone looks at the stocks that led the sell off, most of them were highly overvalued. It's irresponsible after some point not to split and offer their holders a better deal.

2866 2018-10-25 04:09:04 Corporate buybacks, dividend hikes, M&A and activist investors. In this market, if you have to go long stocks, I would suggest finding stocks that will remain in demand with underlying bids.
2867 2018-10-25 04:05:16 Stocks are falling because Trump tariffs are killing international trade and driving up cost of goods
2868 2018-10-25 04:05:08 Don't over-pay for stock market analysis:

“Growth stocks like tech do really well when everything is accelerating and tend to not do so well when things decelerate,” said Jerry Braakman, chief investment officer .
2869 2018-10-25 04:04:51 Trump wants powell to drop rates to zero, that will fix it trump says........... Laughs,  um, okay lets just sell off whatever stocks were tanking today, see if we can hit a second highest drop.
2870 2018-10-25 04:03:50 Regarding that second downward spiral today in last hour...def felt panic. Stocks reacted that way as well.  First real true panic in last few weeks.  Needed a monster shakeout and fear to hit B4 we start turning around.  Maybe this was it. $ibb $spy $xbi $vix
2871 2018-10-25 04:03:45 Technical supports broke on a ton of stocks today. Hitting the technical supports for the SPY - chips are tanking, tech stocks are being dumped so maybe its a good time to hold cash... The market will rise again but how many days until we get out of this cycle?
2872 2018-10-25 04:03:43 It was a nearly perfect correlation to the tax cut percentage.  Tax rate cut from 35% to 21%, a 40% cut, and stocks jumped around 30% pretty quickly, then petered out once the immediate gains were made.  A big scam.  Big corps have lower tax rate than middle income earners!  Dumb

2892 2018-10-25 03:55:59 Global debt is now higher than before the credit crisis and liquidity will tighten going forward. The severe sell-off's (3%-5%) are increasing. Tech stocks are one of the main reasons as they have been the most over-valued relative to rest of the market.
2893 2018-10-25 03:55:50 Yes! That’s why when someone tells me na she has enough stock back then i always ask why she didn’t sell it  ang funny kasi! They say na may 500 stocks sila ng konbat and legit pa so dapat talagang matyaga mag tanong pag ganon dapat di marupok

2955 2018-10-25 03:25:36 The relative returns compared to other asset class matters. In the 1964-1981 example, both bonds and cash declined in value. Stocks at least retained their value (zero real returns).
2956 2018-10-25 03:24:43 The debate is whether simply holding stocks in a rising economy and low but rising interest rates will cause low returns by themselves. My position is that we will be fine. You disagree. We agree that if Fed unexpectedly raised short term interest rates things looks really bad!
2957 2018-10-25 03:24:27 Right on target! And people will put the blame on you even if you have sold the position and told them why and the price of the company keeps going down. I usually prefer to discuss about stocks I don't have to either warn or see if I can get rebutted

2970 2018-10-25 03:19:49 Yes, but if you had purchased stocks they would have return 19% annualized returns. So, if between bonds and stocks since 1964, you would be still ahead with stocks given that bonds lost 40% in real terms between 1964-1981.

2977 2018-10-25 03:15:56 Guy is a complete loser. Claims to be a mining analyst, but in reality all he sells is fear. Bashing mining stocks is all this guy really knows. Pretty easy to do near bear market lows. If he actually had a clue he'd turn a profit on miners, not sell people his tabloid trash.

2979 2018-10-25 03:15:20 #Stocks,#Indexes One NDX model completed a bottom signal at the close. The other model looks poised to complete by around 1100 at the latest.  SPX does not appear to have begun a bottom signal.  A rallying NDX would surely inspire the broader market.

2981 2018-10-25 03:13:23 .@ASavageNation why's your newsletter emailing out tips on marijuana stocks yet you blast it on air? Tried emailing & was told to contact on Facebook or Twitter. I'm not mad, just a fan who's curious because I've seen the benefits.
2982 2018-10-25 03:13:20 U.S. Market Check
The sell-off in U.S. stocks accelerated, wiping out gains for the year in both the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, as mixed corporate earnings and weak housing data fueled anxiety that rising prices will crimp economic growth.
2983 2018-10-25 03:13:07 Even if the billionaire only made a few hundred thousand in all the stocks he messed with, you lost big-time, because you didn't have a few million dollars to play with! In fact you didn't have a dime in the stocks to play with! Rich S.O.B.s don't care about you, or your life!
2984 2018-10-25 03:12:51 Stocks crumble as global growth, U.S. earnings fears spook...
2985 2018-10-25 03:12:48 Stocks plunged as Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation unveiled a staid bottle cap today.
2986 2018-10-25 03:12:32 This is where discipline is crucial. I'm pulling back a lot of my crypto exposure here. Stocks may or may not pull crypto off a cliff. If they don't - all good, let's make some more money! If they do, I'll be prepared and protected. Be a trader, not a gambler. $BTC $alts

2988 2018-10-25 03:11:48 Didn’t want to take any more heat on a Eurodollar position today so I flattened out.  I’ll put it back on when you guys are done panicking about stocks.  Which may not be over yet, I just can’t let it run.  But I don’t see the Fed changing policy from this.

2990 2018-10-25 03:10:10 Investments that only go up - are frauds. Markets move and change, stocks that dont, represent a breakdown of the market itself.

2992 2018-10-25 03:09:08 Stocks were extremely down today for wwe it went from 83$ to 78$
2993 2018-10-25 03:08:35 In a trending market, yes. In this volatile market where stocks can fall even after publishing good results, long strangle should work better
2994 2018-10-25 03:08:16 > Guess what happens next! The stocks plummet in value, way below what your broker bought it at, and you now have a lot less money invested in stocks, and it won't climb back, because it never should have gone up, in the first place!The rich bastard made money, you lost a lot!
2995 2018-10-25 03:08:04 support level is $9.68 CAD when algos freaked out due to market wide volatility the institutions organized a sell off taking stocks down to support levels. if you get it under that you’ll be laughing when they do the fake out and it hits $20
2996 2018-10-25 03:07:51 The levels of cash on sidelines in crypto is far higher than levels of cash on sidelines in stocks right now. There are a lot of people waiting to see what crypto does if stocks tank, so if we stay steady, then those people will buy.
2997 2018-10-25 03:07:44 People tonight wanted to know what was wrong with their stocks tonight. The answer? They are stocks....
2998 2018-10-25 03:07:00 It was funny seeing all the #MAGAs here touting the stock market months ago. Many who did not own stocks.
2999 2018-10-25 03:06:53 Why are assuming that stocks were overvalued in 1967? I would say there were too undervalued and hence spectacular growth after 1982 onwards!
3000 2018-10-25 03:06:11 By your last sentence I can only assume you are joking. In case you are not- Per your 55% figure, I bet here too 1% own 70-80% of all stocks, throwing regular Americans crumbs at the mercy of their market shaking moves. Save the spiel for your freshmen info/recruitment seminars.

3005 2018-10-25 03:03:28 Stocks extended yesterday's sell-off.  Boeing's (BA) post-earnings surge disappeared after housing data disappointed -- afternoon selling intensified, as Beige Book supported Dec rate hike. As a result, stocks fell to their lowest daily closing levels in months.  #StockMarketNews

3008 2018-10-25 03:02:38 Generally traders/ana are using older trading models to trade on Tech stocks that don't behave like normal stocks. It's why they are mostly wrong. Tesla is worth a lot based on peoples subjective feelings rather than the fundamentals. But now they can back up feelings with facts.
3009 2018-10-25 03:01:47 This should no surprise. Stocks seem to always do better with a Democrat in the White House. Just a fact.
3010 2018-10-25 03:01:34 Also in...we need to stop focusing on stocks as our pulse in economy. The majority of Americans can neither afford them or put into a 401k. Our wages are matching the 70s if you factor in inflation. Better pay and stronger unions
3011 2018-10-25 03:01:34 That gif makes us want to sell penny stocks to pay for a new mouse pad!
3012 2018-10-25 03:01:24 Agreed, stocks look awful, hasn't shown up too much in the numbers yet.
3013 2018-10-25 03:01:20 My 15 year old started a stock market game at school last week! He asked me tonight how to short stocks!
3014 2018-10-25 03:00:52 Stocks go up then go down. Then up then down. That’s how the market works.

3016 2018-10-25 03:00:18 While nominal interest rates were high (15% at the peak), the real interest rates were much lower because of the inflation. Most likely combination of higher labor’s share of the economy, stocks not being very popular and high inflation were the main reason lower returns in mrkt.

3020 2018-10-25 02:59:23 Just think about it for a minute. If you had ( 5 billion dollars). You decide you want to mess with the average persons head, that may have a few thousand dollars, or even a few hundred-thousand dollars, in stocks, through some broker. A billionaire could take 10 million dollars>
3021 2018-10-25 02:58:39 Stocks went through the roof after that period once Volcker managed to engineer a recession. My opinion, most of the GDP growth during that period went to wages and inflation delivering zero real returns to the investors (bonds lost 40% of the value).
3022 2018-10-25 02:57:01 We both agree that we will be loading marijuana stocks soon. I just think we are about a month away. If the trend changes though I will start grabbing shares earlier. Right now they are fun to trade on options.
3023 2018-10-25 02:56:29 If they had liquidated stocks last year and bought back into gold would have been trade of the century. 
3024 2018-10-25 02:56:17 Bullshit! Stocks did incredibly well under Obama.
3025 2018-10-25 02:56:12 The only reason stocks were up as high as they were is because of corporate BuyBacks. And 0% interest corporations borrowed money and bought their own stock pressing the stocks up. Fundamentally it was always a mess. And if you think it's bad now wait until student loans default!
3026 2018-10-25 02:56:01 would they come under Circular Trading ? if these firms r indulging only in these stocks for last few days?
3027 2018-10-25 02:55:36 Common sense laws like raising the legal limit, banning bump stocks and other things that turn regular weapons into automatic weapons, better backgrounds checks and screenings, and longer waiting periods. You know. Common sense. 
3028 2018-10-25 02:55:27 It’s clear rotation in to safe heaven!  Consumer goods utilities that gives barely 7%. Return including dividend a year compare to 15-20% into growth !! Guess what they not gonna like it soon and run behind the tech stocks would spike  nasdaq by mid November!!
3029 2018-10-25 02:55:10 The most important 3 words anyone can learn in terms of making decisions about investing or trading stocks is "I don't know." It will "make" you more $$$ than any decision or conclusion you do make. Tonight's a good night to realize that. $SPX $NDX $IWM
3030 2018-10-25 02:54:57 That must be why stocks just ranked today! Total loss of 2018 gains! Such a failure, Trump.
3031 2018-10-25 02:54:14 Stocks crater after traders determine tha the Bills are out of the Super Bowl picture.
3032 2018-10-25 02:54:07 A 10% correction is not getting destroyed. 50 PE stocks going to 40 doesn’t bother me.  I’m a buyer. We always have more cash coming in. Holding tons of cash now.  Tesla is cheap compared to any peer.
3033 2018-10-25 02:53:41 Stocks stumble upon fears the Democrats might win the Midterms. If Trump wins big, expect a huge surge.
3034 2018-10-25 02:53:01 Are you better off? Are your stocks making you money? Has your pay increased?
3035 2018-10-25 02:52:27 For the record stocks are falling because of disappointing earnings from big names, the prospect of the fed unwinding QE (it’s been more than 10 years) and the tariffs imposed by @realDonaldTrump are hurting manufacturers through their supply lines. And causing costs to rise.
3036 2018-10-25 02:51:37 But if you look at the media, they’re focusing mainly on pot stocks being down. No one is talking about what an EPIC disaster tech is bc most people need it to do well. Ppls 401ks, Iras all dependent on tech stocks doing well. They’re in for a BIG correction. It’s far from over.
3037 2018-10-25 02:50:49 Keep an eye on those stocks, the left over pluses from President Obama are starting to go away. What you see from now on, are on your liar in chief.
3038 2018-10-25 02:50:03 Of course it is, sector is dead right now. All MJ stocks can’t catch a bid.  Shorts in control. We need a big news catalyst to move this
3039 2018-10-25 02:49:48 Let's talk .how October stocks are on the road to having the worst year in a decade. way to go.
3040 2018-10-25 02:49:18 life is terrible and im very upset but the silver lining is one of my stocks on neopets just sold for 216%
3041 2018-10-25 02:49:00 US stocks: I am up 50% A shares: pass US stocks: I will rise another 50% A shares: pass · · · · · · one year later US stocks: I fell 4% A shares: I am with you, big 6%!
3042 2018-10-25 02:48:21 Ross I ask again. Are you not noticing that the market is destroying high P/E tech stocks? If you are getting P/E contraction in tech sector why would $tsla go higher from here?
3043 2018-10-25 02:47:46 Perhaps why Nasdaq is reshuffling overvalued stocks...
3044 2018-10-25 02:47:34 Anyone still watching the Stock-Market? If you have money in it, you better get it out, and save it before the billionaires play with the stocks again, and you are left with an empty 401k or other stock portfolio! They play by buying a stock, raising its worth, then selling fast!
3045 2018-10-25 02:46:05 If they do not sell any of their holdings once this entire crash is completed the value will be at least 50% less than it was at its peak. Stocks will drop that far and maybe even more.
3046 2018-10-25 02:45:29 @DonaldJTrumpJr @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @MELANIATRUMP @IvankaTrump Hey Jr. stocks decline erasing gains for the year of 2018 aren’t you going to brag about that? Of course not because you have zero integrity. #TinyTrump Good luck in jail Jr. 
3047 2018-10-25 02:43:53 stocks are falling because your boy, the Orange Menace, keeps imposing tariffs. Oh, and the country is in turmoil because of said Menace.
3048 2018-10-25 02:43:36 Soooooo, what happen to your stock market today. I call it yours because most people can’t afford stocks.
3049 2018-10-25 02:43:09 Does it matter to you that the Dow and all other stocks are still at record highs? Everything goes up and down and you only see a small piece of the big picture? Sad to have such a short memory from the historically bad Obama era and beyond.

3089 2018-10-25 02:26:32 It was most likely a market maker after someone covered some puts. There are plenty of big block sells and buys going on throughout the day. Half a million dollar buy isn’t all that big for Nasdaq stocks.

The #US equities/stock market is now providing some gr8 opportunities for future capital gains. Buy growth #stocks, & those of cos with strong fundamentals. Hold, accumulate dividends, then, sell when prices increase appreciably. Price gains+div yield= capital gains
3095 2018-10-25 02:22:12 I think Director Antonio Gracias, Elon's sobertweet buddy  put the kibosh on that if I had to guess. Thinking stereotypical millennial losing all that money today in hype stocks- bad look to bring more dummies to Q3. Flew in special to babysit and make today possible.
3096 2018-10-25 02:22:07 People say the same of Gold and Stocks, and as we see in the data, there is no strong correlation of those assets. At least correlation data is readily available, so, sure, let's watch for any changes. Tradingview has a correlation indicator as well.
3097 2018-10-25 02:22:02 Right now, nothing except maybe buy some gold mining stocks. Study a lot, and when value investors like Buffet start buying, start picking up solid stocks like tech stock at each new low.
3098 2018-10-25 02:21:12 @Richmond_FC tiges take a look at Jordan Murdoch cats delisted maybe worth a look at fill the stocks
3099 2018-10-25 02:21:10 Stocks go up and down sweetheart. Why do you not want to believe or hope that America will be prosperous? I don't get it.  People are doing well. I think that's GOOD. I want us all to do well and live happy lives...why don't some of you?
3100 2018-10-25 02:21:07 But if you're a trader looking for an instant hit based on whatever MC something has whether it's any good or not then you wouldn't bother with these stocks.
3101 2018-10-25 02:20:50 I like to think I’d invest the money in a diverse portfolio including real estate, businesses (both established and start-ups), precious metals and cryptocurrencies, annuities, stocks etc etc. I wouldn’t just spend it. I’d spend only what I could earn off the investments.
3102 2018-10-25 02:20:38 Trump tweeting about stocks today ?  No
3103 2018-10-25 02:20:37 Then you chose a weird article to attach that point to. If an admin claims stocks as evidence of their policies every chance they get, it can hurt their messaging when the stocks go down. You know this.

3105 2018-10-25 02:19:06 Cant see BTC rising in the early stages of a major stock correction. And there cant really be any seasonal thing for BTC because it has not been even 10 years. The best thing that can happen is that risk off sends BTC to 3-5K and stocks bottom soon after .Then it will be game on.
3106 2018-10-25 02:18:35 nice $7,818  75 second trade which you pumped in your chat room!! thought you were better than that Dek. The stock had no news or any reason to pop other than a chatroom pump so people can post big P/L's trading penny stocks
3107 2018-10-25 02:18:19 I thought the Japanese Government already owned all their stocks. Who is selling 
3108 2018-10-25 02:18:10 Don't quite get your point..

You've just named three of the most likely stocks to do something over the next couple of years based on their results to date and future trials

What the market makes of them is out of my control

3117 2018-10-25 02:13:39 apple stocks rise by 35%.
3118 2018-10-25 02:13:39 You don't need to look at the stocks if you have trailing stop set. You could have set a 5% or 10% trialing stop. It moves up as the stock moves up & U can work, or whatever, knowing it will auto sell it for you. How many other stocks U have with no stops? I'd look into that, IMO
3119 2018-10-25 02:13:27 Well with weed stocks in the crapper I guess all that is left is to wait on those Crank & Meth IPO’s  @MSTraders_ca @WolfOfWeedST @LeftyTrading @CanadaPotstocks @AlanWeedspan @cana

3128 2018-10-25 02:12:14 Stocks have been struggling ever since the @GOP #TaxScam passed.
3129 2018-10-25 02:12:09 Dangerous. Everytime stocks take a dive they seem to come back up. SDS and SPXU get pummeled to no end
3130 2018-10-25 02:11:39 2/2.  A zero sum game that is ongoing means that the market will never go back to 19th Century lows....but individual stocks do.  Look at GE or Sears
3131 2018-10-25 02:11:33 Much ado about supermicro I'd imagine. Tech stocks have been overvalued for a long time anyways. I've always known they would have a correction. I should have been a short seller. Oh well it will go back up after Republicans win the midterms. I'll wait for it to bottom then buy
3132 2018-10-25 02:11:24 They were probably in the fiden under the bean stocks
3133 2018-10-25 02:11:11 What’s more disgusting is @GoodforFlorida ‘s vote against a ban on bump stocks, raising the min. Age to purchase and closing mental health loopholes. What’s worse than that? Voting against 400 million in school safety funding and a deputy in every school. #Shame
3134 2018-10-25 02:11:08 Stocks have been flat ever since the @GOP passed their #TaxScam.
Plus the massive debt is resulting in rising interest rates that are cutting into stock gains in a big way.

Oh, and real income is down too.  #MAGA
3135 2018-10-25 02:10:57 No,stocks are falling becasue of the sugar high from the Trump tax cuts for the rich & corps. is over. Also,there is increasing pressure on the economy from trade wars, an $800Bil deficit for 2018 & $2.2Tril in additional debt by 2020,flat wages,inflation,rising interest rates...
3136 2018-10-25 02:10:44 Your stocks for magic Mike must be dropping as well
3137 2018-10-25 02:10:36 The Fed, in addition to overvalued, over-inflated stocks...
3138 2018-10-25 02:10:34 Stocks are falling because of uncertainty in the global markets (Japan and China), the recent Saudi mess and because of the steel tariffs. Trump causes this uncertainty because of his random "fly by the seat of his pants" policies and willingness to jack up the deficit.
3139 2018-10-25 02:10:24 2. If you’re Main Street and all the need channels and papers are talking about a stock market crash, then you done spend. You get scared. Even if you don’t own stocks
3140 2018-10-25 02:10:10 That is the stupidest thing I have heard all day. I guess if you look back 100 years you will never find market corrections as it continues to climb?! People do not only buy stocks constantly without selling them to earn money. Learn something before you speak in public.
3141 2018-10-25 02:09:23 Credit is the economy. Tech bust (highest valuations ever) was largely a rich man’s recession. Small % of population own stocks. The impact comes through sentiment. 1
3142 2018-10-25 02:08:22 Problem is that company’s stocks are overpriced. 10 years have been a good run. Time to go down

Asian share markets face a rough ride on Thursday after a tumble in technology stocks inflicted the largest daily decline on Wall Street since 2011, wiping out all its gains for the year.

3145 2018-10-25 02:08:04 So many stocks and ETF’s at 52-week lows. Things are getting verry interesting. Some wonderful businesses are on the verge of going on sale. Patience.
3146 2018-10-25 02:07:13 U.S. Market Check

    The sell-off in U.S. stocks accelerated, wiping out gains for the year in both the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, as mixed corporate earnings and weak housing data fueled anxiety that rising prices will crimp economic growth.
3147 2018-10-25 02:07:05 23 days ago “Don’t Boo” Heller (R-Adelson) celebrated one year of doing absolutely nothing about assault weapons, bump stocks, background checks for domestic abusers, the mentally ill,even terrorists. America’s most mediocre senator couldn’t even react to a Nevadan tragedy.
3148 2018-10-25 02:06:55 Yes, buying large-cap tech stocks at 20x sales (NVDA, ADBE, etc.), mature cyclicals at 2x their historical peak P/S ratios (CAT, BA) and assigning $200B valuations to cash-burning companies (NFLX) probably doesn't end well. Who would've thunk it? Short-sellers' paradise.
3149 2018-10-25 02:06:45 It seems that the index hugely affects most of individual stocks. That’s why it’s called ‘index’ in the first place. Downtrend continues, people with fulltime jobs might want to wait and swing trade when index goes back on rally.
3150 2018-10-25 02:06:36 An equities rout that wiped out this year’s gains for U.S. stocks spread to Asia Thursday as concerns mount that corporate profits and economic growth are peaking amid rising borrowing costs.
3151 2018-10-25 02:06:15 Most of the tanking stocks are tech based. Is it any wonder? Where is this war being waged? Right here in interspace on the interweb.

3155 2018-10-25 02:05:10 The single best idea I've heard by far tonight was from @MarieFranklinM. Pick out stocks you want to own at levels that you think are outrageously inexpensive and put in a bid. Makes more sense than anything. $SPX $NDX $IWM

3160 2018-10-25 02:03:21 True but crypto has not been responding - can't fight the evidence of the disconnect between stocks and crypto. Though would make sense for markets to get connected under extreme circumstances.
3161 2018-10-25 02:02:56 "Stocks are closing sharply lower on Wall Street, led by a swoon in technology companies. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average erased their gains for the year."
3162 2018-10-25 02:02:20 If it is just a normalisation of valuations for growth stocks then perhaps I should have sold some things already. Clearly, the good ones will outgrow the reprising and come good. But everyone thinks they own the good ones don't they?
3163 2018-10-25 02:02:16 Do you think its possible a scenario where gold and stocks dump at the same time? That's what this trader is suggesting.
3164 2018-10-25 02:02:12 I need to learn stocks in a full because i'm interested in investing
3165 2018-10-25 02:01:33 Phd's don't invest in stocks.  Jeremy Siegel - who's a total shill - openly admits he has his money in T-Bills. Dude goes on CNBC and jerks off over stocks but only invests in T-Bills #ROFLMAO @Wharton

3175 2018-10-25 01:58:01 Our Wonderful Ruler Trump was singlehandedly responsible for the entire rise of the stock market. But it's somebody else's fault that stocks are falling.
3176 2018-10-25 01:57:24 I have a bit of a mix. Some low pe stocks, some biotech, some gold, some tech. My exposure is to defensive exporters and gold so would like to think I'm well positioned if it turns out there is a sustained fundamental basis to the current weakness, housing being the obvious risk.
3177 2018-10-25 01:57:07 I would only because i wanna flip houses and trade stocks. That amount would allow me to do that...rn i deliver appliances 6 days a week and it's killing my body so a way out of that would be nice 
3178 2018-10-25 01:56:30 My gains on 2018 stocks went down the tubes today.
3179 2018-10-25 01:56:27 Remember two things got bombed today:
1) Stocks and those who own them lost trillions.
2) Liberals and News ppl were attacked.
3180 2018-10-25 01:56:23 Agreed just thinking that we could have a strong support close by. Also QE isn’t the only story. Investors have assigned very high valuations to stocks/mkts with rising ROE. US super profitability cycle is the main reason for lasting outperformance vs EU/EM where ROE stayed flat
3181 2018-10-25 01:56:21 I’m impressed with the level of trust bitcoin users have in the market manipulators that determine their net worth every day. Truly an impressive level of vulnerability. I have trust issues, so stick to stocks and USD.
3182 2018-10-25 01:56:08 Market Update - Wheat and soybeans led the pack lower, pressured by concerns over achievable export volumes for US stocks. The AUD slightly lower this morning as the USD traded near a two-month high overnight.
3183 2018-10-25 01:56:01 Muy pobre imagen dejo @clubgoesoficial en la Liga Sudamericana. Deberá reformular estratégicamente el equipo, Upchuch nunca se enganchó con el equipo y pierde línea cuando Stocks no está en la base. Defensivamente fue muy poco intenso. Tiene mucho margen para mejorar.
3184 2018-10-25 01:55:48 This should be no surprise.  The financial engineering that took stocks for a delusionary run is becoming transparent.  Using more deficit spending by cutting corporate taxes gave a one time artificial boost to P/E’s.  That party is over and the debt payoff begins.
3185 2018-10-25 01:55:42 It's my humble view that since the Nasdaq has fallen off its perch taking many of the mid level bios with it the net is going to be cast wider to try and find value.

That will come to good AUS  bio stocks over the next year . Some of them are astounding value by comparison
3186 2018-10-25 01:55:03 How you know you're in a Public Policy school: when lecturer ask who here buys stocks/ bonds?
And only one person raises their hand.

Big difference as to when I was in business school, indeed.
3187 2018-10-25 01:54:25 Marijuana stocks selling off has nothing to do with the Dow and Spy and everything to do with a speculative bubble sell off that has happened the last five years. They will sell off until December and then start moving up again.
3188 2018-10-25 01:53:48 Many Americans are vested in pension plans that rely heavily on an expanding market. If you have a managed 401, brokerage account, stocks, bonds, 403b, almost any investment you are in the market.

3206 2018-10-25 01:43:54 Lol, its "correcting" when the GOP have control huh?

It's not correcting, it's just waiting for all the failed crashed stocks to be replaced in the index with better ones...

It's a facade, it always looks like it recovers, cuz it only shows the top performers.

"Correcting" lol

3216 2018-10-25 01:39:24 I’ll put it differently, valuations are just earnings yields. You are saying they are low. I’m saying bond yields are low too. If bond yields go down valuation goes up (where we were). If they rise, equity valuations fall. They are related but rates are driving, not stocks.

3226 2018-10-25 01:36:32 I unloaded a few stocks like CSCO a few weeks ago anticipating this exact scenario.  People will become nervous that Democrats might get some control and thus the market would be very volatile for a while.  Glad I did it!
3227 2018-10-25 01:36:13 Bio rerate has to occur because the better stocks are miles cheap compared to international peers . We've been saying it for years . Sometimes these things take a long time.

The issue was it was in mainly rubbish specs . A shot across the bow that bodes well for the good ones
3228 2018-10-25 01:36:05 And while some mutual funds are made up of bonds or gold and silver, the vast majority are made up of stocks. You might want to check your funds. One should always know where one’s money is.

3241 2018-10-25 01:31:08 Last small dip BTC also went down some.  I would think if a person loses lot in stocks and is also inveSted in crypto which is more volatile then they would like to preserve what they have and pull out of crypto?!
3242 2018-10-25 01:30:43 Anyway its funny to see people think their favs are the cause of stock market drops when the stocks of the entire world are all currently dropped. I'm not even in business and I know this lol

3254 2018-10-25 01:23:14 Good! Only 25-30% of Americans own stocks. All of corporate profits are going to shareholders not wages for employees. The economy is and will show the effects of GOP tax policies until Dems step in to fix them as always!
3255 2018-10-25 01:23:03 I hear you on that one too, most of the negative profit &  overvalued stocks are in those sectors, but I haven't looked under the hood to see the detail but I think that is mostly correct. I will take a look at that post, thanks for calling my attention to that!
3256 2018-10-25 01:22:57 1/2 of America has no stocks or investments of any kind so unfunded GOP trillion tax cut to 1% supposed to pay for itself but didn't stays on federal deficit GOP is trying to pay down by cutting everybody's social security & healthcare.

Measure how many hungry/sick not stocks?
3257 2018-10-25 01:22:09 Trump did right by lowering taxes. The market was in the right position for that. What he fucked up on are the tariffs. What corporations fucked up on was buying back their own stocks with their tax returns.

3259 2018-10-25 01:20:42 the apparent tops stocks are putting in suggest we are going into a steep global economic decline. right now it feels like the sky is falling and no one knows why. the action is some of the worst since 2007. it all seems way, way out of line, like a dislocation. $SPY #stocks

Yeah - I think he got credit for that. Also adding bigly to the national debt with his tax scheme for the 1%

3270 2018-10-25 01:15:43 October has been a brutal month for stocks. The Dow lost 600 points today and analysts are beginning to blame Donald Trump’s tariffs. Some big companies are worried about higher costs due to the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China. ~ @NewsandGuts

3278 2018-10-25 01:11:30 Yes. 
I see typical index ETFs as the main "Gor for it" solution.

On the other hand it is a bit astonishing for me that the FI community is so obsessed with low fee Vanguard funds, but we don´t often hear about investing directly into stocks, with 0% TER fee over time.
3279 2018-10-25 01:11:00 I think stocks are falling because it’s becoming more obvious every single day that Trump is in over his head & has surrounded himself with crooks and idiots. Wall Street knows the window of opportunity for looting our coffers is closing; Trump’s downfall looms as we vote blue.
3280 2018-10-25 01:10:39 Many of these ratios (price-to-GDP, Peak PEG, etc.) need to account for low tax rates, low interest rates and economy coming out of recession, emerging market crisis, etc. So, yes, stocks will adjust downwards when interest rates go up but it does not mean they are overvalued 1/2
3281 2018-10-25 01:10:11 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
3282 2018-10-25 01:09:38 Yea man , the narrative is being tested as we tweet. it’s Gona be really interesting to see how crypto responds to a bear stock market . However If we have sustained bear stocks i feel like it would only take a bit of solid upward Btc movement  to set off a bull run.
3283 2018-10-25 01:09:17 This was caused by the huge deficit competing with private borrowing, causing interest rates to rise and stocks to crash!

3290 2018-10-25 01:05:39 Give it time and some of these stocks that have not been hit yet; will be sold. They shoot the generals last. MCD AAPL CSCO KO VZ have room to the downside. I would err on the side of caution here. But, that is just me...SQQQ looks like it has room to run....
3291 2018-10-25 01:05:34 No that's conspiracy type thinking. For awhile. Stocks were very cheap and we had a recovery. The pricing eas justified. Stocks are now expensive amd perhaps, fujdamentally unjustified. I dont buy the fake market bs
3292 2018-10-25 01:05:23 Indexing further narrowed of market participants. Value guys were done completely by 2016. Lost AUM or quit. Now here we are with nothing but growth lemmings, and guess what?

The sell-off in U.S. stocks accelerated, wiping out gains for the year in both the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, as mixed corporate earnings and weak housing data fueled anxiety that rising prices will crimp economic growth.

3331 2018-10-25 00:44:41 Four tips for Buying Stocks from Lottery Winners

1. Use a "throw darts" method, except in a full moon.
2. When picking stocks during a full moon, use the Heimlich maneuver.
3. Never hold a stock longer than a bagel stays fresh (day trading standard operating practice).
4. YOLO.

3335 2018-10-25 00:42:56 I liked Kudlow’s show on CNBC, but stocks have historically performed better under Democratic presidents.   No one looks at who has Congressional majority when it comes to market returns.
3336 2018-10-25 00:41:54 I feel your frustration, my dad has been a gold & gun investor since 2009.  He’ll try to talk stocks, but uses terms like “fibbinachi retrace” when he stares at stock charts.  Would be retired if he just used index funds for 20 years

3338 2018-10-25 00:41:39 Historic fall. I looked in $ndx chart. Last time this big fall happened was during 2008's recession time. Since 2016 stocks were growing too much too quick unexpectedly. May be crash in need.
3339 2018-10-25 00:41:10 Tech Stocks Lifted the Market This Year. Now They May Be Leading It Into a Correction
3340 2018-10-25 00:40:41 Quality Growth stocks are down a lot relative to the market is why.
3341 2018-10-25 00:40:21 I'm loving this. Adding to long term positions such as BABA. It's also giving me a chance to consider the marijuana stocks because I was not a buyer when they peaked.  Market cycles are GOOD. It gives us that chance to get stocks "on sale"!
3342 2018-10-25 00:40:16 I in good shape for October, been reading everyone's tweets. no one knows when corrections will end or how deep. People get more bearish as the market declines further, i.e. J.C., vs. more prudent at tops, taking perspective on certain stocks after big pullbacks, just observation
3343 2018-10-25 00:40:02 I always keep stocks in hand but am thinking I must add to it substantially - I worry about losing power - then frozen food no good and no means to  cook
3344 2018-10-25 00:39:15 Its possible....even longer than 5 years. Gold difficult to rally as long as Stock rally continues the way it has been. Everyone believes stocks are going to infinity.
3345 2018-10-25 00:39:15 Should the stocks just keep going up for ever. Something has to give-in. Mid-term, Fed rate hikes, China tariffs, Saudis and Italy problems just few that sums it up.
3346 2018-10-25 00:39:10 Stocks are going to start rising 
3347 2018-10-25 00:38:11 株が落ちた時に買い増ししてたけど、損が少し多くなってしまった。これからの買い増しは余裕がなくなるので、落ち着くまで放置。
I bought more when stocks fell, but the loss has gotten a little more. As future purchase increase can not afford, leave until calm down.
3348 2018-10-25 00:37:15 $AMD no worry. Copy 10nm then low cost. Stocks will be up again.  C'mon
3349 2018-10-25 00:36:19 Hang on a second.  Are you telling me if you give tax breaks to big companies they will use the money to buy back stocks?  This buyback will artificially inflate the stock market, and then when the buyback is done, the market will crash?  Who could predict that?
3350 2018-10-25 00:36:10 The US markets aren’t down much from their highs, but I’m finding a lot of value in certain stocks. My watchlist has the highest number of possible ideas since early 2016. Exciting times so far this fall!
3351 2018-10-25 00:35:49 My wife does this A LOT! Even at the fabric store and hobby lobby. She stocks up for next year so its self consumption.
3352 2018-10-25 00:35:46 The guys is definitely not built for the volatility of spec bio stocks. That I can promise you.
3353 2018-10-25 00:35:36 What stocks would you recommend for beginners to buy if they only have $ 500.?

3357 2018-10-25 00:34:04 I have rarely panic sold in my life, but i have panic bought plenty of times .. just bought a $hitload of stocks that bled out 10% + today.. I can’t buy $hitcoins , cuz im not a $hithead.. but i might be a fu$king retard for buying the blood bath on stocks prematurely

3359 2018-10-25 00:33:41 Hey Justin, wondering how you are trading stage 4's. Shorting stocks directly or inverse etfs?
3360 2018-10-25 00:33:28 If you survived 2008-09 market crash and came this far means you can get through the current situation too. This should be easy if you know when to switch to cash and when to get back to stocks. Easy to say but one needs to be disciplined to get out of trouble.
3361 2018-10-25 00:33:13 There are multiple reasons why stocks go down. Market sentiment is one but other is discounting based on earning projections. So unless one can identify potential earning rockstars like Buffet, waiting for price action to show price upward movement is better deal.
3362 2018-10-25 00:32:30 Our legally elected President is looking for our Nation's interests. Look at NAFTA Trump accomplished an agreement that is great for USA between Mexico and Canada,China is next. Stocks are responding to the Feds raising interest rates on purpose to hurt him.
3363 2018-10-25 00:31:48 $KGKG IS MOVING! TOUGH TIME OF THE YEAR FOR ALL STOCKS.
3364 2018-10-25 00:31:24 Today the Percent of Stocks in the SPX in an uptrend dropped below 60%. Only 3 times in the past 10 years has this happened when the number was previously higher.  2008, 2011 and 2015. All were better years to be tactically short or in cash. Good luck.
3365 2018-10-25 00:30:15 and $10,000 invested on 12/31/17  would be worth about $10,000 TODAY #stocks
3366 2018-10-25 00:30:12 Sorry about the Stock Market dive the last few weeks folks. I sold off a ton of stocks and made bank! 

3367 2018-10-25 00:29:54 where'd they get those accurate stocks of cube after hyuna left omg
3368 2018-10-25 00:29:23 So I thought I’d try my hand at investing, you know, be an adult right? So I started small and only wanted to invest $100, looked up some good stocks and bought them. Well... Now they’re only worth $80.64. 
3369 2018-10-25 00:29:05 I don’t invest in stocks long or short. Therefore, no advice from me. I’ll leave that issue to others.

3371 2018-10-25 00:28:44 I feel like the person who decided to call it a reverse stock split was being a little lazy. Maybe it works, but I always have to start with thinking about a stock split and then think about the reverse part and how it's not splitting at all but actually fuzing into less stocks!
3372 2018-10-25 00:28:41 Another ugly day for stocks.  Only discretionary trades I made today were securing 7-8% profit on Brazil ETFs to keep cash up further over 80%.  Was stopped quickly and systematically on some small re-initiates from past 4-5 trading days.

3384 2018-10-25 00:25:12 No, not yet... we got a long way to go for stocks to bottom. Don’t catch a falling knife into the beginning of recession!

Stick to crypto where the market has actually bottomed!
3385 2018-10-25 00:24:56 It’s Jacob still trying to be relevant. And still sore that he can’t trade stocks and securities on US exchanges.

3387 2018-10-25 00:24:40 Tech Stocks Led the Market Higher This Year. Now They May Be Correcting It
3388 2018-10-25 00:24:37 Stocks have fallen for 13 of the past 15 trading days, including a 3.3 percent drop on Oct. 10 that was the market’s worst fall in eight months.
3389 2018-10-25 00:24:32 It goes up & down you know that. You own stocks right? Whats the issue, we didnt blame Obama every time our stocks dropped, not how it works.
3390 2018-10-25 00:24:21 running false negative isn’t a good campaign strategy!What are you doing for healthcare? Why are you against pre-existing conditions? What about sensible gun legislation and bump stocks and universal background checks and Your A rating from NRA?
3391 2018-10-25 00:24:16 Was it that one blonde econ major who talks about stocks all the time and how reedies who leave wall street jobs “ruin hiring chances for the rest of us” because I hate that guy and that’s immediately who I thought of
3392 2018-10-25 00:23:08 I’m surprised they’re buying Bakken, has there been excessive stocks selling at a discount in Cushing, @Big_Orrin? I can’t see why they’d risk buying railbit at Anacortes and risk exposure to the vagaries of ANS competition or god forbid, Dubai linkage
3393 2018-10-25 00:22:55 Good stuff. Hope there's more to come. Would love to hear your thoughts on why ppl say the fed must tighten because current bullish data but stocks r falling because future weaker data. If markets discount future, y not fed? Stocks could use a little Mursey from Powell
3394 2018-10-25 00:22:41 Stocks are looking sketchy. Hope everyone has their bitcoin.
3395 2018-10-25 00:22:19 Don’t hear @RealDonad_Trump bragging about stocks lately lol
3396 2018-10-25 00:21:07 @jimcramer China will be the world  leader sooner than we think. China stocks are good buys. Economy and political Stability and social  responsibility.
3397 2018-10-25 00:20:34 Very true, now managers are useless unless you have lots of money they won’t help much and they work in their best interest not yours, the advantage of an index is that it tracks a group of stocks, and it manages itself through algorithms following the stocks
3398 2018-10-25 00:19:52 Lots of cheap biotech stocks to choose after this October.   $IBB $XBI
3399 2018-10-25 00:19:18 I like those low subpenny as well, but here lately been trading mostly big boards and trading very little otc, too much dilution for me, I have absolutely no interest in buying dips in stocks that are diluting i'd rather trade something else or just wait, just my opinion
3400 2018-10-25 00:19:02 I think what people forget is how much money CENTRAL BANKS have poured into stocks (Swiss bank with $140B into tech stocks in the spring, for instance)...unprecedented, and any CB money in stocks 3 years ago would be considered a conspiracy theory. They’re the dumbest money.
3401 2018-10-25 00:19:02 You can buy penny stocks (stocks under $10). Sirius satellite radio, pandora, Ford, GE all in that range
3402 2018-10-25 00:18:49 I guess it was low rates and not trump letting coal companies pollute more which was boosting stocks. Who knew?
3403 2018-10-25 00:18:25 Investors have a 'two-fold reason' to buy given-up-on stocks like FANG, Cramer says - CNBC
3404 2018-10-25 00:18:09 But compared to Trump’s 1st 20 mos Obama laid an egg (and is now crapping his pants). “Obama’s record” was about the Fed’s “quantitative easing” which lowered intrst rates to near 0%. This drove all the money that wd hv bought bonds to stocks artificially driving up prices.
3405 2018-10-25 00:17:15 You’re right of course. I own stocks property & even dirty filthy fiat cash as well. Bitcoin just happens to be the at the bottom of my list of liquidation preference. The position was sized with the expectation of a binary outcome - it’s either worth zero, or much more than now
3406 2018-10-25 00:16:58 #Dow is down by 600 points. Other markets getting crushed too. Is this the beginning of the global market meltdown like 2008? #stocks #StockMarket

3411 2018-10-25 00:13:46 As much as I don’t want stocks to plunge, I’d love them to tank long enough for my colleagues who will vote for trump as long as the economy is looking good to change their minds.
3412 2018-10-25 00:13:26 Again, it's down THIS week. Overall trend is positive. Why weren't you saying this when the stock was at record high a couple months ago? We've been in this spot several times over the year, stocks go down, it's called a correction, but it's still positive overall, just watch
3413 2018-10-25 00:13:08 How about those stocks today?
3414 2018-10-25 00:12:27 Stocks taken to the woodshed.

Bitcoin flat and boring. 

..those correlation numbers are starting to look interesting
3415 2018-10-25 00:11:45 Yields are rising, from a low starting point. That is potentially problematic at some point & that’s part of the reason stocks are correcting.
3416 2018-10-25 00:11:12 autos there are cheap. 
@Honda
@Toyota
@Nissan 
are now deep value stocks.
3417 2018-10-25 00:10:07 You're still up 298% on the SPX since March of 2009.  Are stocks never supposed to correct when valuations are ridiculous?
3418 2018-10-25 00:10:01 Stocks?
3419 2018-10-25 00:09:39 US stocks closed drastically lower, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq being down by as much as 3.0% and 4.4%, respectively. The selldown was driven by concerns over a slowdown in global economic growth as well as dismal quarterly earnings results. #UStracker #morninghuddle
3420 2018-10-25 00:09:04 Dear Diary, today is a sad day. Trump is making good progress on all of his promises that got him elected. The American people are better off than they were 2 years ago. Unemployment is low and stocks are high. This is my hell ..I call America. Border wall funding ..I will die
3421 2018-10-25 00:08:30 Almost no bullish setups out there but lots of bearish ones showing up even if they're not good ones. Very few all time highs being hit in any stocks. And the selling doesn't feel as panicky/sudden as most of the other ones seemed to me.
3422 2018-10-25 00:07:56 Lets hope so for metals rally & a minor relief for #stocks. So I can than short them later.
3423 2018-10-25 00:07:42 There's a report Disney plans a "Pirates of the Caribbean" sequel -- without Johnny Depp. The news caused mascara stocks to plummet.
3424 2018-10-25 00:07:40 Please tell us how many ‘assault rifles’ and bump stocks have been used in a shooting. Be very specific.
3425 2018-10-25 00:07:13 Does it bother anyone else that people who sell stocks are called “brokers”?
3426 2018-10-25 00:06:03 Majority of the stocks are 1 year lows and below!! Its become a bi-polar Market can't predict anything.
3427 2018-10-25 00:04:18 Bump stocks and assault rifles are not
3428 2018-10-25 00:04:16 Big investors selling stocks, migrant invasion, threats of terrorism: all 2 weeks before election. Coincidence or Trump haters at work?
3429 2018-10-25 00:03:50 I bought stocks today for the first time on @TDAmeritrade
3430 2018-10-25 00:03:04 Pass on to Mr DeSantis that our CA gun regs have stood up in court. Like bump stocks being outlawed since 1990. High capacity mags as long as I can remember. Universal Background checks, 10 day waiting period on all sales, and the newest, BG checks on buying ammo.
3431 2018-10-25 00:02:46 “If you want to shoot off 60 bullets in 60 seconds, go join the military,” Gillum said as to why he wants to ban bump stocks in Florida.
3432 2018-10-25 00:02:28 "But Alastair," they say, "how can stocks be overvalued when they've already fallen a brutal 10% in just one month?"
3433 2018-10-25 00:01:57 This is no laughing matter ..
...That's how Russians and Asians learned about eating ketchup with their steaks ...
...I shoulda bought stocks ..
3434 2018-10-25 00:00:20 Dec 1, 2008 there were 3,101 stocks down 4% or more on the day.

Damn.
3435 2018-10-25 00:00:05 like, the narrative was that it should act as a hedge.. for now the major currencies are still relatively stable, while gold is pushing up from this setback on stocks and btc is not, so I'm not sure if the 'hedge for stocks meltdown' narrative will materialize already.
