0 2018-02-01 23:59:05 Well if your not enjoying your stocks or 401k you can send the money to me
1 2018-02-01 23:58:39 Ugh, I really want to go to TFF but I should be responsible and not, considering work situation… But I briefly had a 3 in the ten-thousands place in my checking account… And still 5 digits of stocks available. Ugh.
2 2018-02-01 23:58:30 Honestly, unless it happens directly to them, they won’t care. It’s all about the $$ to them. Disgusting. On a plus side, the state of Massachusetts banned bump stocks.
3 2018-02-01 23:58:06 Wow, so index ETF and growth stocks for the wealthy? I get your point, but I think the decision should be based on risk tolerance and time in the market. Not on your wealth level
4 2018-02-01 23:57:57 As you say, this was a rare situation. He had 12 rifles lined up w high capacity magazines & bumpstocks. If he’d been shooting semi-auto I have to imagine he would have gotten off fewer shots before being stopped. Either way, I don’t see why bump stocks need to be a thing.
5 2018-02-01 23:56:16 The real world where 84% of stocks are owned by 10% of people where stock strengths mean little to most. The world where are president is a liar and thief and takes credit for trends clearly and unequivocally started because of Obama era policies. #truth
6 2018-02-01 23:56:11 Facts R Us? Cur: And frankly you’re sexist too god is a fucking orphan stocks are just falls out of the graveyard and unstable
7 2018-02-01 23:55:53 Salaried people are being crushed. The marginal moneybthy would make from investing in stocks is closed as well. How is the helping a middle class tax paying salaried individual. SAD! It's been long wait for any progress to see under BJP regime.
8 2018-02-01 23:55:49 Bet on it. Crypto recover almost overnight. Stocks takes years.
9 2018-02-01 23:55:22 Yes, we know how bump stocks infringe on the 2nd Amend,right? By tomorrow, many Senators will have new $$$ into their coffers from the NRA.
10 2018-02-01 23:55:21 Ellen you should like Donald Trump since you are making so much more money now with the stocks growing so much & all the sales from your retail products. You are so greedy that you sell everything. Quit being political, over 50 % of the people voted for trump & we’re glad we did
11 2018-02-01 23:55:16 Profits for Alberta and Ottawa and most of the risk for BC.  Increased tanker traffic.  Potential for leakage.  Potential spill contaminating the BC coastline. Depletion of fishing stocks.  Environmental degradation. Less tourism.  Alberta get jobs and BC loses them.
12 2018-02-01 23:54:25 Truth is truth ! Falsehood is falsehood!! Seeing is believing! Stocks market flies up like a rocket ! God bless America and its people!
13 2018-02-01 23:53:47 As it's a state law, it only prevents new sales inside the state. No way they will be able to enforce anything other than that. Will be simple enough to mail out of state, pick it up and return with it. This law will be ignored by many, maybe most that want these stocks.
14 2018-02-01 23:53:37 So that's just the last 3 days....come  on stocks are a long term investment.
Market is still at an all time high
15 2018-02-01 23:52:26 No. Eugh. Tony Blair is not special. He needs to be in stocks. And with rotten fruit thrown at him.

17 2018-02-01 23:49:55 I’ve been trading stocks since I was sixteen but I broke discipline and put all my profits into a penny stock company and lost everything.

38 2018-02-01 23:49:02 First of all, these are not stocks.

Second, it has been a lot worse in the past.. maybe you should zoom out?
39 2018-02-01 23:48:46 I got a tax break too. Would give it up for the good of the country. Most Americans are not affected by the stock market. Stock market has been steadily rising before Trump cheated his way into office. Deregulation makes stocks rise too, while they destroy our air & water.
40 2018-02-01 23:47:22 How many cabinet members and  are stocking up on steel stocks. It seems a right of passage for our Republican elite. Screw medical,environment,and consumer protections, all for the pursuit of power, wealth and phony respect. We should spit on you ( like Vietnam vets were unjust

43 2018-02-01 23:44:55 The GOP investigated Clintons private business affairs and found nothing, can you only imagine what the same rigor in investigation would turn up over Trump's business affairs, w/o any #trumprussia target, just he and his cabinet money exchanges w/ foreign govs and stocks.
44 2018-02-01 23:44:39 At first I thought it was ignorance on your part however I'm starting to believe you have a vested interest in @realDonaldTrump's connections to Russia. How much do you own in oil/gas stocks that will benefit from the #TrumpRussiaCollusion? Truly you're a disgrace for the Nation.
45 2018-02-01 23:43:59 I agree, and w/ gun politics being as divisive as they are, it feels like the least we can do is try to limit mass carnage or at least make it slightly more difficult. Would he have taken fewer lives w/o bump stocks? I don’t see any way he could have taken more.
46 2018-02-01 23:42:27 I find the stocks ultimately pointless and less effective except in the way this was planned out.
47 2018-02-01 23:42:17 Agree, added as well
48 2018-02-01 23:41:53 $AAPL bad earnings an stocks go up an good earnings stocks go down lol
49 2018-02-01 23:41:36 And I am far from perfect.  I probAbly sell more stocks at a loss then I do at a gain, thankfully when I do stumble on a good one, it’s a good one.  Over the past 10 yrs I have lost 10k on primero(recent), 10k ok Newcastle(my first junior pick), 4 k on ion, just sold my bag. Etc.
50 2018-02-01 23:40:24 My Tesco stocks them till good Friday then all the staff reduce them in the stock room and buy them themselves... bastards
51 2018-02-01 23:38:13 Awesome, feel free to share your advice on good stocks too please.
52 2018-02-01 23:37:45 @endimem_music Zelig pelosi is the bachur who is obssessed with stocks.
53 2018-02-01 23:37:19 Idiots guide to trading #crypto.

Stop comparing crypto to FIAT your trading your alt coin against BTC
You trading your pair to get more of the# BTC or more of the Alt coin
If you have no clue how to #Ttrade it is understandable 90% can't trade stocks either
54 2018-02-01 23:36:28 It seems so simple and logical doesn't it?  Then you factor in the 100's of millions of dollars the NRA uses to buy a group of politicians and there you have it.  No gun control.  Can't even talk about bump stocks.  More guns than citizens at this point.
55 2018-02-01 23:35:52 Plus the country is already feeling the dollar crunch! Where will the money come from? You bible thumping idiot we need to lower the debt not add to it! Grave danger on the horizon! Stocks are at risk??
56 2018-02-01 23:35:18 Obviously, some guys don’t get that a lot of people who were in as soon as 2011 or 2012 went through situations way worse than today and were rewarded this past year. Let them buy some stocks or bonds or real estate, maybe they’ll get it.
57 2018-02-01 23:34:23 If people in jail could buy stocks and trade freely then #Potstocks would be going through the roof
58 2018-02-01 23:31:52 I thought I bought Wells Fargo stocks yesterday... turns out I bought Bank of America instead
59 2018-02-01 23:31:48 none , because americians haven't gotten a pay rase, he hasn't invested in infustructure , he has killed the soloar industry  he has only made the rich richer  and that's why stocks are booming , but wages are stagninct
60 2018-02-01 23:31:19 Cool then, if you are interested in getting any alerts or advice for stocks that are good candidate for day trade feel free to ask.
61 2018-02-01 23:29:10 The west always claimes to own the term "humanity" declaring it "western values" Where are these western values, if they contradict business or geopolitic interest? Real western values are €, $, stocks, bonds, derivates... weapons,+recently refugees&Kurds as currency 2deal with.
62 2018-02-01 23:29:01 Fucking laughing stocks. That's all these people are.
63 2018-02-01 23:28:43 Aussie market opens softer with the #ASX 200 -9pts or 0.15% to 6080pts. Commodity stocks stronger but losses in healthcare & telcos weighing #ausbiz
64 2018-02-01 23:28:05 @option_snipper Do you offer any trading education services?  Willing to pay good money for it.  You definitely seem to know your stuff.  Looking for TA education on how to scan for stocks and entries.  Thanks.
65 2018-02-01 23:27:54 Completely agree. If the overall economy is on an upward trajectory, so will the stocks be.
66 2018-02-01 23:26:24 Nobody's mentioned freesias yet! Or azaleas! Or stocks! Gosh I love flowers so much. In the garden: forget me not, aubretia, snow in summer.
67 2018-02-01 23:24:09 Stocks will go down when they go down. I don’t make predictions based on what I think *should* happen.
68 2018-02-01 23:24:05 God help us....I’ve got everything crossed that he makes it this time, even if it’s only for the sake of anyone else wanting to buy a McDonald’s or a Krispy Kreme....the stocks are dangerously low with all the trips recently..... 
69 2018-02-01 23:22:09 Tech looks to have a strong day tomorrow with $AAPL and $AMZN leading the charge. $GOOGL taking a little away but with $AAPL being 12%+ of the whole index, nothing can compete if it jumps big. #Heavy #Weighting #Stocks #APPLE #Earnings #Amazon #Google

71 2018-02-01 23:21:57 Where do I go to see my tax information on my stocks@stockpile
72 2018-02-01 23:21:32 Please, don't talk to me about basic economics, until you learn how to read a statement. Because again no one said anything about a check being written by Mexico, until you did. And you can look back at the posts for proof
73 2018-02-01 23:21:00 Honestly stocks and cryptocurrency both utterly baffle me. There's no tangibility whatsoever
74 2018-02-01 23:19:32 I’m certainly not inclined to chase those stocks however I am looking at VXX for a short position after hours if it should bump it up a bit
75 2018-02-01 23:19:12 Yes he does and doesn't have a 401k or any stocks. IF he did he would at least listen to fox business.
76 2018-02-01 23:18:51 Think I'll just hold. Got rekt in crypto and stocks today. Brutal.
77 2018-02-01 23:18:40 And I sincerely doubt they're going to agree to anything along those lines
78 2018-02-01 23:18:27 That would be like if I took some of my own money, went over to your place and built a deck, and then build you for the rest of it. You didn't ask for it you're not going to pay it are you? There's no way Mexico is going to pay for this wall, without a prior agreement
79 2018-02-01 23:18:18 Just to be clear, if u’re looking for some hot chicks exposing their skins, go to the beach or simply go theu the ‘net or u better don’t at all, gym is not a booty stocks u pervert
80 2018-02-01 23:17:52 However that's not what we were promised. Now you're saying we're going to build the wall, with some of our own money, and then what Bill Mexico for the remainder?
81 2018-02-01 23:16:59 Who said anything about a check? Oh you did. Nobody said anything about Mexico writing us a check, except for you. I have been saying all along that there's no way to force this other country to pay for our wall. I know us taxpayers will pay for it.
82 2018-02-01 23:16:13 bloodbath thursday! stocks down, crypto down, index down - wha's going on???
83 2018-02-01 23:15:18 Four of my stocks are in halts or suspended and the rest may as well be... #why
84 2018-02-01 23:13:37 Better than you giving the money away to people who don't belong here!  Amazing, money means nothing to you people unless your stuffing your wallets & stocks with it!
85 2018-02-01 23:12:53 Are your stocks red today? Is good to remember that 75% of the stocks will follow the market and guess what. The market is red today! Just chill and enjoy the ride #stocks #stockmarket #investing
86 2018-02-01 23:11:15 Le, lives on Vista Viejo with wife.

Put all their savings into sea salt stocks. Can't retire.
87 2018-02-01 23:10:58 It's easy to make a bull case for stocks amid cryptocurrency losing its financial bid. If the real economy is running hot, why waste time with cryptocurrency?
88 2018-02-01 23:10:39 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda

90 2018-02-01 23:10:07 averaging down when stocks have been cracking key support levels for weeks now is one of the worst strategies and its a rookie mistake you only average down on dips not on massive sell offs like the MJ sector
91 2018-02-01 23:09:32 For those claiming traditional #stocks to be safer and more valuable than #cryptocurrencies: go ask people who had invested in #Enron or #LehmanBrothers

92 2018-02-01 23:08:54 Oh, great. Now we have a CDC that doesn't work either? I forgot. The woman who ran it was too busy buying tobacco stocks to run it. Trump is running us into the ground, figuratively and literally.
93 2018-02-01 23:08:48 Oh I’ve heard Alex Jones toting the conspiracy theory already....tinfoil stocks on the rise!!
94 2018-02-01 23:08:27 None shall be named after you...
95 2018-02-01 23:08:11 The bond market is the canary the $GNP 5% print will ruin 300PE FANG STOCKS
96 2018-02-01 23:08:06 I have a portfolio of volatile junior resource stocks,  mostly mining.   Any suggestions how I can hedge it?
97 2018-02-01 23:07:49 Higher #Yields, weaker #USD, higher commodities, higher #stocks and more upgrades by fundo analysts... Feedback loop.. #Reflation #Cycle rages on..
98 2018-02-01 23:06:39 release the memo please cause if you do it will show how guilty you are and what a pathetic president you are. and when you do i will be moving my stocks to a different country and i urger others to. Cause Trump is going down
99 2018-02-01 23:06:08 So much money made trading options into earnings wow! Who would ever trade stocks so boring!
100 2018-02-01 23:05:43 Made money getting them sick, and then again when they sought treatment. Stocks in tobacco and healthcare. #DoubleDipping
101 2018-02-01 23:05:22 1PG reborn! haha. The Shell has Merchant Funds on the board who seem to be fairly sharp and have a history floating some other cannibas stocks, it could potentially run, will be interesting.
102 2018-02-01 23:03:32 $MEM small unloved stocks that has shown some signs of smoke recently.....
103 2018-02-01 23:03:06 All of Trump’s anti-government militia friends don’t want BLM anymore. It’s odd, remember they hated Reid, Clinton, Obama....solar panels, stocks, minerals, gold, water, uranium. They’re domestic terrorists too on the FBI list.
104 2018-02-01 23:02:59 Give out all stocks >>
105 2018-02-01 23:01:43 Are earnings on stocks considered interest? That's what confused me.
106 2018-02-01 23:01:27 The Planet Money podcast on the Dow is super interesting. GE may not be doing so hot, but their market cap is still higher than a good chunk of the other DJIA stocks
107 2018-02-01 23:00:13 like why did I just learn UNCC apparently has beef with us
108 2018-02-01 23:00:03 The 51.25 point (-1.8%) fall seen in S&P Futures so far this week marks the softest start to a week in the 65 weeks since 3 November 2016 #stocks
109 2018-02-01 22:59:47 So the project can get started. You actually thought Mexico was going to write a check for it? Hilarious! Real world,think of it like an investment. We put up x we save overtime y x- y =z  Mexico paid for it over a set period of time. A check, really? Wow.  Basic economics.
110 2018-02-01 22:59:24 You shud watch the movie,The Post, based on a True Story by Steven Spielberg. The Post, a US Newspaper, violated a National Security Protocol, but the US Supreme Court voted in favor of the Post, Freedom of the Press. Rappler's sin is merely issuing Stocks for Foreign Investors.
111 2018-02-01 22:59:02 So true. HYIP sites are a known scam...Just like the pump and dump game in penny stocks. The DOJ said they had enough evidence to establish probable cause if it went to court.
112 2018-02-01 22:57:38 ...and plenty of middle class people have stocks in their retirement portfolios.
113 2018-02-01 22:57:35 of course, theirs profit to be made for trumpkin and co (he has a lot of stocks in arms manufacturers like ratheon) and if Afrin goes turkey can keep arming and funding terrorists to keep syrian war going for years, if turkey has to retreat from afrin it will likely lose idlib
114 2018-02-01 22:57:16 @ErikVoorhees If publicly listed stocks will one day delist and re-list with a security token. I have to ask, is that your plan for #BLCN? Would shareholder securities in the regulated market be converted to tokens in the new market?
115 2018-02-01 22:56:51 3% and rising on the long end of the curve drives money out of bonds and into stocks, near term.
116 2018-02-01 22:56:15 Higher oil price and gold may help commodity and oil stocks
117 2018-02-01 22:55:55 teens love stocks and bonds, my friend
118 2018-02-01 22:55:22 The way some of these service stocks are getting stuffed makes it feel like 08! Anything with debt getting totally smashed. Avoiding for now but I'm sure we'll see bounces once dirty short sellers have finished.
119 2018-02-01 22:54:52 Idiot millionaires are freaking out because the stock market is down. But not me, I don’t own any stocks because I have no money.
120 2018-02-01 22:54:46 just curious, where exactly do we "find ourself" now...? Stocks are up/taxes are down/my friends r going back to work...so?
121 2018-02-01 22:54:20 Wait, wut? Busykid? Baby stocks? (Also, on the topic of elaboration, you should DM me the skincare regimen you mentioned a whiiiiile back.)
122 2018-02-01 22:53:45 U.S. fund investors race into stocks despite sell-off: Lipper #money #is #king #crypto or #fiat
123 2018-02-01 22:52:48 Thanks for the layup. Expanded background checks, limitations on conceal carry, banning hi-cap mags, bump stocks & suppressors, enforcing gun free zones, requiring gun locks. NRA opposes all of these, by the way. Do you?

135 2018-02-01 22:48:19 Shark News-@FoxNewsChatter-Juan Williams would never “honestly admit” how much his 401-K went up! What about your stocks Juan? You a great goy..Just a “lousy democrat”! You area typical “educated DEM”!

137 2018-02-01 22:47:35 A close on Friday below 26617 would end a run of 4 weeks of gains, over which the Dow had rallied a total of 1898 points (+7.7%). A close below 26212 would mark the biggest weekly drop seen in the Dow for at least 73 weeks (since 9 September 2016) #stocks
138 2018-02-01 22:47:14 Why does a civil society have laws ~ for those that lack commonsense! Therefore, Congress needs to pass legislation which prohibits assault rifles, bump stocks, large capacity magazines, etc. & requires better gun registration w/tougher enforcement and severe penalties!
139 2018-02-01 22:47:14 Is this a joke?  An unbiased observation asks, how many times of bashing their heads against the wall does it take before all the Trump Hating attacks stop?  No nomination?  No win?  Stocks fail?  Unemployment up?  Companies fleeing?  Stop the try try again.  Too many fails.
140 2018-02-01 22:46:47 And @apple makes a comeback by with premium iPhone prices of the iPhone X and apple watch revenue increase!

I guess I was wrong to have sold my stocks! 
141 2018-02-01 22:46:44 $CIO see if the market has digested the news yet. Am truly amazed they have flagged revenues to increase by another 367%+ this year to over $10Mp.a ! That puts them as one of the highest earning ASX tech stocks, it's performance beats at least 5-10 capped at $100M+

146 2018-02-01 22:43:41 isn't that the good rule in stocks?? buy what you know you can influence in your political position and cash in quick and sell high??? it's not insider trading, it's Republican heritage rights

154 2018-02-01 22:39:12 $AAPL $NFLX $FB $AMZN  I don't believe these and other stocks are going to get sold due to a 2.79% 10 yr Bond. Since these are the leaders and the financials go higher when interest rates increase it makes more of a case for a higher market which is not uncommon in market history
155 2018-02-01 22:37:39 Are you working on a budget? DACA? The Opioid crisis? Health care? Mass shootings in America? Bump stocks? Raising minimum wage? Russia intervening in our election? No. Why? Because you are too busy discrediting the institutions that make America great & protecting the prez.
156 2018-02-01 22:36:36 The first CBOE and CME contracts expired around 17th and 26th of Jan, this may have also caused closing out long CASH positions, as their hedge expired.

169 2018-02-01 22:31:51 In the last 2 days I started selling off 10% of my shares from all of my stocks - google, amazon, Facebook & Netflix. I will continue to do this over the coming weeks. The market has been crazy recently and It’s a good idea to have more cash on hand in case of a correction.

171 2018-02-01 22:30:39 And on the other issue, things like bump stocks should never be legal.... Or anything that makes a semi-automatic similar to a fully automatic.
172 2018-02-01 22:30:00 You better save that little bit of money your bragging about because these next few years are going to get HARD. Real estate is faltering, the stocks are correcting.

181 2018-02-01 22:25:14 Crazy thing about “ investing” in general is that there’s always a risk..

Ex) investing time for someone 

Or even stocks.

There’s no gurantee of positivity

190 2018-02-01 22:22:03 Exactly.  They label it as private and enjoy all of the equity in the stocks.  Any of your friends have that as a part of their stock folio?  I have rich Hollywood friends that can’t even put their fingers on it.  The Feds have their hands all in their own business.
191 2018-02-01 22:21:50 $AMZN lets get over that 1500

So to answer the question,
And in this I'm not kidding;
The answer is this,
it objectifies women.

222 2018-02-01 22:06:40 Important:

Crypto is not a "make money fast buy a lambo and live in a mansion"

Crypto trades with a lot of volatility compared to stocks, you can play your cards right swing trading. 

But it won't happen in 1 week.

240 2018-02-01 21:55:31 $42.30 a week is very welcome. The % reduction in my taxes is larger than the Corp reduction and the 1% reduction. $42.30 just paid my gas bill, so now I can eat lobster. Or buy stocks. A sweet deal!!!

258 2018-02-01 21:50:01 Yeah but the issue is the volatility of weed stocks. It’s (ahem) baked in. The gains we saw literally 2 weeks ago have not only disappeared, everyone’s losing money fast. We all got addicted to the gains, double digits, etc. I sold all my smaller stox but even big boys are down.
259 2018-02-01 21:49:50 Best to wait to see where the bottom is. Tomrrow will paint the tape. Although I did buy some stocks inwhich I thought was cheap . But may even be able to get it cheaper
260 2018-02-01 21:49:20 people are too busy buying stocks to GAF about bonds at 2.7% or 3% or whatever

263 2018-02-01 21:48:05 Private hospitals used to deny treatment to poor patients becoz of lack of money. Now its open loot for these hospitals to earn tax payers money up to 5 lac. Just multiply by 500 million and imagine how their balance sheet will improve. Time to buy Hospital Stocks.
264 2018-02-01 21:47:28 Rune Crossbow uses yew stocks, not magic. Magic stocks are used for Dragon crossbows. Yes, it's very confusing to everyone.
Bossing requires more time than simply killing mobs, so I'd still be happy if you could check the tables when you have free time back at work. Thanks again.

267 2018-02-01 21:43:50 Historic moment: @Avigilon is acquired by @MotoSolutions just now. Stocks going up crazy! Everybody seems happy-shocked in our firmeware team :)
268 2018-02-01 21:43:44 The beauty of owning defensive stocks such as $RHT or $RQHTF is that they will generate revenue & cashflow regardless of the state of the market. IMO @ReliqHealth is one of the best long-term positions that will keep building shareholder value so long as execution is in check

278 2018-02-01 21:40:22 their exit or entry points, all manipulating to their own benefit and well being,and then taking credit for those who have actually made money saying they are helping them. When the stocks are up the person who made it apparent is a genius
279 2018-02-01 21:39:56 And say what you want if you think im bashing block me, but im literally trying to find some proper insight. If noone is willing to shed it then that is that i guess and my conclusion is twitter is more poisonous then i thought. A bunch of people pumping stocks but never exposing
280 2018-02-01 21:39:23 Plus, traditional investment instruments such as fiat currency/stocks/bonds are also confidence driven to a certain level. It's just that most of those market capitals and markets in general are more matured.
281 2018-02-01 21:38:42 @deen yea brotha... let see how it goes.. volume did good today... better then most days and other stocks
282 2018-02-01 21:38:34 Rising interest rates are bothering stocks, but rates are up because growth, revenue and profits are up.  We use a 3.5% 10-year yield in our stock valuation model, and it still shows an undervalued stock market. This dip is a buying opportunity.
283 2018-02-01 21:38:18 I made $20 in stocks today so if you guys wanna chill before I’m a millionaire lmk
284 2018-02-01 21:37:55 Oh no we're not we put him in office because we trust him over the Democratic Party.

288 2018-02-01 21:36:10 Some stocks had it coming. I called $IFXY yesterday (on ihub) and $BYOC dippage on my feed days back. $PURO, my main holding, took me by surprise bigly. Chart looked ready to fully breakout and big news 2 days ago showing $51M revs possible once/if 5 facilities are built in 2018.
289 2018-02-01 21:35:41 Also stocks from eg Hura's Crossbow Shop, IIRC. And evil trees, but those'll be patched out soon (did the F2P D&Ds before I got the memo that magic logs were a no-no).
For bosses I'd have to check the drop tables at work, but pretty sure we updated them. Kill 'em and find out. ;)

291 2018-02-01 21:34:23 This year's Fed stress tests will put banks through hypothetical crisis in which unemployment spikes to 10%, stocks fall 65%, and housing prices falling 30%
292 2018-02-01 21:33:53 For every bonus handed out, how many jobs have also been cut? For every thousand dollar one time bonus that was probably already in the works, how many million dollars worth of stocks have been bought back? $1.5 trillion to corporations and how much into fighting opioids?
293 2018-02-01 21:33:14 $AMZN booming, amazing company.  $FB and $AMZN go to stocks
294 2018-02-01 21:32:42 Their dresses are lovely. I shop mostly when they are on sale. Such value for money! This online store that I was mentioning stocks them and they are Sydney based so most days it’s same day or next day delivery.
295 2018-02-01 21:32:30 Stocks rally has faltered, still stocks remain near records, with the S & P 500 and Dow Jones average less than 2% below
296 2018-02-01 21:32:12 Not a great day for stocks. Dow up 37 but faded all day after being up over 150 early. S&P and  Nas down. 10 year sold off to yield 2.77%. Breadth inconclusive - 1 to 1.2 and 1 to1. Need a pop to avoid down week.

302 2018-02-01 21:30:41 $bpmx another small cap runner.  Look what $aker did.   People are flocking to the sub $1 stocks.  Strong close on huge volume.   Tomorrow premarket may torch shorts even more.

311 2018-02-01 21:25:12 Hello! Based on Yesterday's Stock Market Close - 2018-01-31, these stocks have sell signals based on a Mean Reversion Strategy (1/6):
312 2018-02-01 21:24:41 Almost Close for MBS -42bps and 10yr Treasury 2.78%; Stocks close at DOW +37.32; NASDAQ -25.62; S&P 500 -1.83; The new Inflation Outlook is spooking investors into less risky Yields (faster Fed Hikes and declines value of Bonds fixed rate over it's term life).
313 2018-02-01 21:24:40 I'm in tears  over the fact that you actually think there is a scenario where the 1% whose wealth makes up the majority of our economy (stocks, factories, manufacturing equipment, imports, exports, etc.) would somehow not have a greater increase in wealth.
314 2018-02-01 21:24:36 Comeback? The bull market in stocks began 107 months ago. And there was a record-breaking streak of 83 consecutive months of private job growth when Obama was POTUS.
315 2018-02-01 21:24:34 I swear I'm in the same boat. This is why I don't play with stocks and such anymore!
316 2018-02-01 21:24:23 Wall street scamming investors again today, tax cut not helpful with investments/IRAs ripoff. Fake news, false rumors on U.S. companies as well as shorting, then mass selling, client's stocks
317 2018-02-01 21:24:09 Final point. It's not the news, it's the reaction to the news that counts. And after hours action is very different than regular trading hours action. #stocks #investing
318 2018-02-01 21:24:02 So did Agri related Stocks Mr Tharoor.What are you implying.
319 2018-02-01 21:23:55 OK, let's digest this. Obama takes credit for high stocks, more jobs, defeating ISIS, Increase industry, Tax cuts. bonuses, increase military, etc, etc,. Obama has done all this, while not in office. But could not do in his last 8 years.  Uhmmm Let me think about this.
320 2018-02-01 21:23:43 Gas last night @$2.29 gl. At 10:00 am today it shot to $2.69.We are in th midst of an oil/coal group doing everything for their stocks, and these special interest groups that they owe favors to. If the pollution from these fossils fuels don’t kill us, our empty wallets will. 
321 2018-02-01 21:23:26 @KennyPolcari Nothing in earnings reports, albeit good for $AMZN, would cause me to discount an even higher valuation for these stocks& overall market THAN ALREADY BEING DISCOUNTED-ie, WHY PAY EVEN MORE than already v/hi PE's? More consolidation. Look for $SPX 40/50-day 2740-ish.
322 2018-02-01 21:23:00 @OldNavy I foresee stocks declining..
323 2018-02-01 21:22:39 @brandnb yeah that secondary derailed it for awhile-I think it’s pulling in with other semi and storage stocks like tsem and MU
324 2018-02-01 21:22:12 Nothing in earnings reports, albeit good for $AMZN, would cause me to discount an even higher valuation for these stocks& overall market THAN ALREADY BEING DISCOUNTED-ie, why PAY EVEN MORE than already v/ hi multiples? More consolidation. Look for $SPX 40/50-day 2740-ish.

332 2018-02-01 21:17:24 i thought today's action was bullish and constructive for stocks, particularly in the U.S. - to me it suggests much more upside to come. we'll see... $SPY $MDY $IWM $IWC $XLF $XLE

338 2018-02-01 21:16:33 bad news for stocks now that the 10 year bond yield is above 3%, can only get worse for stocks....
339 2018-02-01 21:16:14 So mtg stocks is showing foil sacred cats are like $60 today. Is that real? Can I actually sell the random foil sacred cat I have for money? Or do I just not sell it and revel in the fact I just became kitty rich?
340 2018-02-01 21:16:12 This is debatable but IMHO Gold leads at turns and IF we take out 1377, Miners will play catch up rapidly and wave bye-bye as they pass Gold by on the surge higher. In the meantime, miners weighed down by stocks in general here. Miners are heavily indebted too: higher yields?
341 2018-02-01 21:16:07 Been investing and trading stocks for 15 years the cross  over is 3asy but I hate the amount of idiots in th3 marketplace.  Panic selling buy high sell low dummies
342 2018-02-01 21:15:51 Stocks struggle again to keep rally going. Key indexes end mostly flat.

Smaller stocks lure buyers after lagging blue chips in Jan. 
Russell 2000 +0.3%.

346 2018-02-01 21:13:59 Richard, love your work...but...Doesn’t this all translate to stocks are going to blow higher and any setback is a buying opportunity due to CB put?  Doesn’t market already know this which is why all dips are bought like a Pavlovian dog?  
347 2018-02-01 21:13:48 They have ulterior motives sure. They are short stocks. So they make money that way. But if this exposes predatory lending practices that keeps my people in perpetual debt then it must come to pass. Otherwise Capitec will recover.

379 2018-02-01 21:05:20 Alot of people threw the kitchen sink at $SX.  Since then things haven't been the same.  It was a black hole that sucked up everyones faith and money in the stocks.

391 2018-02-01 21:00:54 Breaking (4:00 PM EST): Stocks close lower in choppy session as higher rates snuff out rally... -- CNBC
392 2018-02-01 21:00:42 Only weed plays left N.c and one related $rlv. Sold $rks and $LG last week before the bleeding. I'am long namaste (in at 0.30 cents) I don't care about fluctuation but I admit that it always hurt when you see your stocks bleeding.
393 2018-02-01 21:00:36 When bond yields offer decent value then stocks roll over, until then should be ok w decent macro data. After that rush to exit. Last one please turn out the lights.
394 2018-02-01 21:00:24 The 10-yr #TreasuryBond Vigilantes have it ALL wrong. They think because the rate is abt 2.8%, that means Stocks abt to go Belly Up. But the REAL reason is b/c the US is bringing more debt to mrkt than it thinks it can sell and has to make it more enticing to, say, China
395 2018-02-01 20:59:58 Please tell me why we are wasting time going over the difference between stocks and bonds  if you don’t know that you really shouldn’t be in an upper level business/finance/economics class

405 2018-02-01 20:55:19 I've been following and recording a number of big stocks.  All of them lead back to the $SX bomb.
406 2018-02-01 20:54:46 They have been selling $AAPL and using it as a source of funds to buy other FAANG stocks.

435 2018-02-01 20:42:27 I love the move higher in rates here as bond guys come to terms with the health and future growth/ inflation prospects of the economy. Its creating a short term headwind for stocks that earnings will take care of and ultimately makes the economy more healthy.

447 2018-02-01 20:37:48 So many people claiming they are market experts still averaging down on all those Canadian weed plays .... just take the loss and revisit later when set ups will be clear dont try to catch the falling knife and predict bottoms #stocks #tsxv #tsx $csx #pot #weed

474 2018-02-01 20:36:37 Actually I just sold stocks and switched it to Canadian money market which is gaining against the falling value of the US dollar, it's safe
475 2018-02-01 20:36:33 All y’all know what inflation is but y’all really acting like y’all making more money I feel sorry for the dumb people who don’t understand what’s going on I hope a record number of people begin to invest in the stock market hope y’all all are buying stocks 
476 2018-02-01 20:36:17 Nate, come on, I didn't just fall off the damn turnip truck. That sounds like weak lip service to me. What is going to be the strategery you plan to employ to get these 18 year old's their right to drink. I mean, I sensing bump stocks apathy from ya.
477 2018-02-01 20:36:01 If one bought at 18K on the way up now sells at 9K on the way down, someone buys at 9K by selling maybe stocks but if the seller was on margin there is no money left :) Impact on other markets unknown.
478 2018-02-01 20:35:21 Rates up, stocks down, dollar down. Seems to be a trend that is starting to form here. 3% on 10Y bears watching closely.
479 2018-02-01 20:35:20 Stocks climb a wall of worry.
480 2018-02-01 20:35:11 If u attribute the hyperbolic run in Semi's to crypto mining, then shouldn't the bubble popping of the coins affect stocks like $NVDA ?
481 2018-02-01 20:35:08 But things are F’d today. Interest rates are creeping up,  stocks are stalling & the dollar is getting hammered. Things are going to have to post up one way or another & most people are just deer licking salt on the road unaware of the massive truck speeding their way.
482 2018-02-01 20:34:44 The more successful stocks split.
483 2018-02-01 20:34:37 Hold the line. Stocks aren’t always on time.

487 2018-02-01 20:32:30 Sure it might not go into stock but I just dont see the harm to stocks, why. Bonds are way more important here eg. Actually the bigger issue is when cryptos are back on run and people will start selling stocks to chase again. Simply put, crypto selloff is not a problem for stocks
488 2018-02-01 20:31:57 $dxy puking today & $SPY struggling to stay green. What happens when the USD bounces since its extremely oversold...... Not a bullish catalyst for stocks. With this kind of move in USD today the spy should be at all time high so something not normal. Like current valuations.
489 2018-02-01 20:31:55 Trump threatens trade war... China is selling your currency and now your stocks.... bitten off more than can chew... and munchkin man even helped them!!!
490 2018-02-01 20:31:50 tax cuts do no good when wall street keeps scamming investors/IRAs like they are doing this week with fake news reports on stocks and companies
491 2018-02-01 20:30:53 My stocks are booming, I'd rather he fix relations between S and N Korea. Much more important.
492 2018-02-01 20:30:32 Do you think the pot stocks are going to keep dropping or is this likely the base for now? I owned none this morning, but bought two at lows today. Hasn't been as much of a bounce as I'd expect. Now not sure about holding overnight.
493 2018-02-01 20:29:15 Great going,  stocks going up and the illegals are getting smaller
494 2018-02-01 20:28:22 if you follow my Tweets about stocks, just be aware that I post about stocks that might offer setups at some point. If I post about a stock, sometimes it might be because I'm offering a fair warning. You may have noticed I posted about aker resistance level today...
495 2018-02-01 20:28:10 Excellent point. Even more “Wild West”-like than tech stocks...
496 2018-02-01 20:28:07 Stocks have the loudest cheerleaders like Bubblevision (CNBC), Larry Fink / Blackrock, Wall Street etc...

500 2018-02-01 20:27:16 @NancyPelosi calls those 1-3K tax bonuses "crumbs". Wouldn't it be nice IF we ALL could LEGALLY INSIDER TRADE stocks like her and the rest of congress. Imagine how many CRUMBS we could all get. Not just those politicians that haven't worked a day in their lives.
501 2018-02-01 20:27:08 I hope this good economy is really worth it to all the poor trump supporters without stocks or healthcare. It was definitely worth stepping down as world leaders so they could feel better about having a black president.
502 2018-02-01 20:27:06 Stocks fall because rates will go up, bond yields rise because rates will increase, and U.S. dollar falls because rates will go up? Beam me up Scotty. $SPY $TLT $DXY
503 2018-02-01 20:26:39 Investment publications often push stocks down so it's easier to buy in and make coin when the market recovers. 

Invest in blockchain tech.
504 2018-02-01 20:26:35 $PLAY Lots of extra spending at Dave & Busters this quarter. And year. Economy rocks like crazy. Should easily bounce back to $65. #stocks
505 2018-02-01 20:25:44 Thanks, local store (Merton) no longer stocks it - which ones stock it please? Lopen Sand is colour name. Is the range discontinued?
506 2018-02-01 20:24:55 Dont see a reason why, cryptos sucked away money from stocks, now it actually returns... look at ETF inflows, madness.
507 2018-02-01 20:24:54 $MJX is a good approximation of the Canadian MJ stocks- look for support here $30/$32.50 - sector should be nearing bounce.
508 2018-02-01 20:24:49 So I'll go out and buy stocks that are valued today at valuations they will never earn anytime in the next 10-50 years time frame. When stuff like this is written or said on TV it's way past time to run as fast as possible from such nonsense advice.

511 2018-02-01 20:23:16 A few observations: Marx was far less dogmatic than most people think. Marx didn't believe capitalism was going to crash right away (heck, he even invested in stocks). He also didn't believe in a single model that would work everywhere. Marx probably would not have liked Lenin.
512 2018-02-01 20:23:05 It's all stocks right now. Red across the board.
513 2018-02-01 20:22:59 What will stocks do if bonds go to say 130 over the next few months?
514 2018-02-01 20:22:46 While everyone else is tweeting and retweeting the stocks that have made their move already. I’m here looking for sleeping giants. The ones being fed right now, not the ones about to shit their pants.

Crypto, USD and stocks.
This an across the board trend.
517 2018-02-01 20:21:08 Naw, if you're a long term player you should wait until this bull market blows off and crashes, and then pick up stocks at prices half of what they are now... otherwise, its guna take 20 years to get your $ back lol
518 2018-02-01 20:20:29 Even better news for penny stocks, bitcoin falls harder as the scams... weird logic you have.

520 2018-02-01 20:20:03 You mean that speech where 75% said he did well (via a poll done by a LIBERAL media network)?  I love all the bitterness  and delusion in this thread. I even love the fact someone said they “cried” after the election. Economy is doing well, stocks are up, etc. So much winning!

522 2018-02-01 20:18:44 Commercial fishermen might not be so happy, especially if the increase leads to greater contact/competition for declining fish stocks.  Should be worth keeping track of in the future.

525 2018-02-01 20:17:25 Stocks like $bb $BB when they really move up, they violently move up and bury the shorts. All pieces in place for this great company under its great CEO to reach new heights and see stock over $50 this year

528 2018-02-01 20:14:26 Most Penny/OTC stocks are far riskier. How safe does the stock market feel right now?

This is just a childish mindset, to blame Square

As a long term investment, Bitcoin is moderately risky compared to most small cap stocks.

You're naivete is showing. Think harder/more broadly
529 2018-02-01 20:14:19 $SPY we have mega caps moving like penny stocks today
530 2018-02-01 20:13:52 The stock market is a forward-looking discounting mechanism. Stocks are rising because earnings are rising and projected to rise going forward. Higher earnings equals market growth. Reduced earnings equals bear Market. Simple.
531 2018-02-01 20:13:36 OK, but why bust $PDXP?  Support $IFXY.  I love $IFXY.  I don't like several others, doesn't mean I need to smash the shit out of them on twitter.  Just do your stocks.  $PDXP will do its thing in time.  Have some respect for others money, IMO.

538 2018-02-01 20:11:41 the SPX must come in. Sure the economy is growing but that's not the issue. Name one company will earn its current valuation in the next 10-100 years. None of them will. The problem is what people are paying for stocks so let the VIX rise and SPX get crushed to a sane level..

594 2018-02-01 19:47:54 #WDHR - ~ Rapidly growing broad-market sales 
Yet another reason there's been a lot of buzz surrounding marijuana stocks is the rapid sales growth and potential within the industry. Regardless of the source, pundits expect significant yearly growth from the legal weed industry.
595 2018-02-01 19:47:11 It's mostly used for stocks, financials and tracking companies, it was a big thing in 2012, dunno if its still used though. Try searching for a stock like TTWO or NVIDIA ^^
596 2018-02-01 19:47:05 Tim, I agree. I got the sense a couple weeks ago that the fumes (pun intended) of the booming biz was moving the stocks and not necessarily financial strength or operational rigor... I scaled down at the time, wish I scaled out more. Live & learn.
597 2018-02-01 19:47:04 All my crypto heads. Hold your coins during a market down turn unless you wanna get rekted. You can sale at your principle buy so you don't have looses but if you spent anytime investing in stocks before crypto (most havent) you'll know to hold em before you fold em
598 2018-02-01 19:46:22 $WDHR !! A massive new sales channel on the horizon 
A third reason marijuana stocks were on fire in 2017 is the expectation that our neighbors to the north, Canada, will legalize adult-use pot by July 2018.
599 2018-02-01 19:46:18 aker offered a great pattern setup at 10:55 this morning for a low risk entry and look where it is now. Those are the kind of plays that fill your wallet so you can gamble on stocks like ifxy

601 2018-02-01 19:45:23 took a small position in $SMRT. Trying to catch the bottom but Know that it could continue to bleed. So, small position now and will add if I get confirmation of reversal. Tight SL if heavy bleeding continues

630 2018-02-01 19:35:00 I was too conservative on baseline for Dow 26,400 & S&P 500  2,855 and now bond pressures see 10/30 year Treasury yields higher: 2.77% on 10s and now 3.00% on 30s. This is NOT a top call at all in yields, but it's where I see bonds starting to compete with stocks for new money.

I know I'm waaaaaay late to the party but it seems like their could still be oppurtunity in []. At a $[]B market Cap, [] and [] seem pretty maxed out but I was thinking more about [] since their market cap is around [].

Bitcoin or tech stocks?
650 2018-02-01 19:29:36 They definitely aren’t the best but Kirsanow uses them especially poorly, comparing flows to stocks for one group but not the others. Appropriate to respond with incarceration rates.

I get my salary after taxes
I take the risk & invest in stocks
I earn a little profit & you want 10% of it

Will you pay me 10% of the losses I make?

#budget sucks
656 2018-02-01 19:26:44 They had $250 B in cash last year “laying around”. Stocks up. They pay more than others in advertising. My point is with the perm. tax cuts co’s could create new jobs, pay for educ & training, change lives perm. Hope trickle down is not the bonuses. Need Higher wages. More jobs
657 2018-02-01 19:26:16 People don't know whether to buy bonds or stocks ... so much value
658 2018-02-01 19:26:10 That is BS, yes there is a way to evaluate these companies. The dollars and cent still have to make sense, and they DON'T at any level near this. Just wait till legalization doesn't happen this year. WHY would you touch these stocks, just brain dead as an investor!

660 2018-02-01 19:25:34 I made a mistake about 2wks ago, I used a figure of 130 million diabetics; the number is more like 30 million; which is great; since we're talking about diabetics. Doctors have an objective to create 130 million, up from 30 million; 2 make diabetic test strip &pill stocks go up.
661 2018-02-01 19:25:23 As goes the bond market, so go stocks. Major indexes now all in the red as the 10-Year Treasury yield shoots up to 2.77%.
662 2018-02-01 19:24:21 Have we considered what $BTC does If stocks get soft in a hurry?  Another short term bearish catalyst.  BTC prob safe haven but I think since no real data on that - BTC knee jerk falls to later rip as a safe haven, if stocks get killed. Just another macro thing to keep eye on

673 2018-02-01 19:19:21 4. Producers blew their wad in Q4. All companies need to spend more then their CFs to slow the drawdowns. But if FANG, CXO, PXD do so they'll get treated like PE. So what gives. Unless China keeps drawing down on domestic stocks - market keeps reducing US stocks.

681 2018-02-01 19:13:01 Yes....this creates a false economy...only benefitting the small % who own these stocks...It's part of the wantonly cruel canard of the Trump/GOP tax scam !
682 2018-02-01 19:12:53 @TrishIntel it is a waste of time to argue with that

690 2018-02-01 19:10:43 Compared with stocks crypto bear market does not last more than a year .
691 2018-02-01 19:10:29 In 2016 it was reported American businesses had 1.9 trillion in cash, just sitting around. That was before the big tax breaks. They have $$$. Huge profits, stocks. They should invest in employees-compete with higher wages and better benefits but they won’t if they don’t have to.
692 2018-02-01 19:10:05 The town should be re-named MurdoFraserburgh and the culprits put in the stocks.
693 2018-02-01 19:09:45 The same with stocks. I was there during the 2 year global financial crisis bear market where every time you put money in stocks you get less dollars the next day .
694 2018-02-01 19:08:37 My friends been buying Crypto for a long time and has made a load of money.  So when he told me I jumped on it.  As far as my knowledge with stocks, I’ve been trading stocks for over 20 years and made a lot of money.  I just took this as an opportunity to make money.

703 2018-02-01 19:04:03 Wrong. I'm not rich nor am I poor. I bought my coins at the bottom because of my dedication to changing my life thru trading (stocks or coins), so because of that I am able to hold without worry.
704 2018-02-01 19:03:36 This is why stores must stock so much merchandise: statues, other toys, shirts, Magic cards. They provide higher margins and balance out the ups-and-downs of comics sales. One of my local stores now stocks more merch than comics.
705 2018-02-01 19:03:23 Wall Street Instant Update; #Stocks turn mostly mixed into the 2pm hour with the Dow up 46, Nasdaq -1, S&P up 3; Oil up 1.2% at $65.50/bbl; Gold settles at $1347.90 oz. up .4%; Bitcoin -9.1%
706 2018-02-01 19:02:54 So, vote here is officially known as "Shall the Rules Chair be sustained?" A "yes" means you don't want debate to ban bump stocks. A "no" means that you do. #ksleg

766 2018-02-01 18:42:46 It’s a virtual currency that’s rise and falls like stocks, so when bitcoin first came out you could buy one bitcoin for $0.18 but it took 6 years for it to be $18k/per one bitcoin 

So if you bought like 20 for $0.18 and you sold all 20 now 

You would be rich 

It’s investments

778 2018-02-01 18:38:47 It's very unfortunate to announced 10% tax on long-term capital gains from stocks and equity mutual funds, Mutual Funds are acting as an important tool for middle class in wealth creation. 

Hope government will rethink.

781 2018-02-01 18:38:04 if you bought and held you could never go wrong according to current US history, as long as you bought an index that is.  individual stocks go bk and get tossed from index (poor #GE).  just hope you don't get a margin call after that 60% pullback in the index after you BTFD

783 2018-02-01 18:37:13 agree. JT, LX, etc growing at ridiculous rate, yet mkt thinks it's fake and w/ gov't stepping in, growth won't be stellar. skeptical at least. imagine 5 yrs down the road for these stocks

785 2018-02-01 18:36:42 A fund manager just told me bond in bear mkt. buying stocks is fleeing to safety. There is just no better option than us equity. Because they -are mandate can’t have more than 5% in cash.

793 2018-02-01 18:33:13 Cryptocurrencys are not shares, it might be the best comparison but its just a comparison. Market caps are a good tool for established stocks, not for new tech / cryptocurrencys. Think Tesla's mcap compared with gm's, is one more speculative

809 2018-02-01 18:29:49 If you can't look at a stock and communicate the valuation to someone or how it can get there without some degree of logic, you are gambling. Most of these stocks that get mentioned by the same group of people on twitter are designed to take advantage of retail gamblers.

824 2018-02-01 18:24:03 Funny how the drops in stocks were immediately pointing at Trump and not hearsay or the ABC NEWS release...ooops, you didn't think ALL American's pay attention to the Swamp Dwellers OR Media tactics.

829 2018-02-01 18:22:36 It wasn’t just Emma that was vilified. Henry was also mocked. These are just members of the public. And it happens on others shows too. I’m sure they didn’t sign up for the modern equivalent of being put in the stocks and having rotten fruit aimed at them.

832 2018-02-01 18:22:05 Yep just wait for it. That’s how I made my money. Dump stocks before they tank and then buy again when low. Hope you know what’s in your 401K and how to reallocate or you will have a repeat from 2007-2009.
833 2018-02-01 18:21:57 @LittleStocks20 yo stocks for my avi/logo could I have a N with a litt blue background and the N in white thanks bro.
834 2018-02-01 18:21:47 No trades for me.  Wanted $LTBR short out of the gate on BS PR but had no shares. $OPGN didn't set up how I wanted to and I had no locates on it either. Practicing patients and only taking golden setups. No need to make unnecessary risks by betting on the direction stocks with.
835 2018-02-01 18:21:01 Impossible! Under Obama, stocks went from under 7,000 to almost 20,000. If you lost money in that market, you either made BAD choices in stocks or had a BAD broker. Market under Trump up but not almost TRIPLED.
836 2018-02-01 18:20:47 This is just so easy. Low rates are good for stocks and rising rates are good for stocks. Like shooting fish in a barrel.

839 2018-02-01 18:20:11 Remember a poor low is merely a single data point.. nothing more.  Why do some poors get immediately get repaired—while others do not until a later date?  Answer is UNSEEN CONTEXT of what is going on w/large sample size stocks/sectors  that make a market in RTH that drive index
840 2018-02-01 18:19:58 That is correct but obviously sotu viewers doesn't represent success. What does, tax cuts, obamacare mandate repeal, judges, keystone, out of Paris accords, drilling in Alaska, EPA scaled back, gov hiring freeze, record stocks, trillions made in union pensions and 401ks, love it

842 2018-02-01 18:18:59 brother, in all fairness, do you know of any shopkeeper in Kabul who stocks Pakistani flags, I've never seen one during my years long stay in Afghanistan, I would give these demonstrators all the credit for taking a stand, they say its the thought that counts, this is action
843 2018-02-01 18:18:51 I don't like those things either...it's why I have never been all that interested in buying stocks
844 2018-02-01 18:18:02 Why would stocks care?  central banks continue to be firmly on the bid
845 2018-02-01 18:17:43 Honestly I’m still pretty hazy on how the stock market functions, but as someone who can’t imagine going anywhere without a book in tow, Hudson’s is a home when home is hard to get to. Good luck on the money trading stuff. Maybe you have a book rec for learning about stocks?

848 2018-02-01 18:16:46 I’ve noticed this too in the last several months. An employee at Whole Foods Market St in SF told me to know better than to “shop at certain peak times” now because out-of-stocks are so common. I never recall empty shelves like I’ve seen recently there. Frustrating.
849 2018-02-01 18:16:31 Haha. I was waiting for him to do this again. Its so obvious now. Simple pattern. (one doesn't even need to buy stocks in reality - just Tweet)
850 2018-02-01 18:15:01 But there are still waaaaay more crappy stocks that should be halted that aren't
851 2018-02-01 18:14:41 9 years of low interest rate fueled mania ending..stocks not even blinking.
852 2018-02-01 18:14:20 Jeremy Grantham's GMO now expects stocks to return a negative 4.7% a year over the next 7 years.
853 2018-02-01 18:13:49 Absolutely, lets chat! Will drop you an email soon.
854 2018-02-01 18:13:22 She should be censored for lying to the Treasury Department. Using minority owned banks"going bankrupt" in order to get a meeting to save them, and only have 1 bank show up to be bailed out. Of course the bank you have hundreds of thousands of stocks in. Waters is a CRIMINAL

857 2018-02-01 18:12:51 As long as people dumb enough to trade a bitcoin for bitconnect coins..don't expect bitcoin to go up. Bitconnect coins should be halted like we do to crappy stocks.
858 2018-02-01 18:12:01 Weed stocks are a volatile ride. You really want to understand how the valuations can get to a point where they make sense. $IAN put out great news today and is down 6%, on a day where I would have expected them to be up 15%... It's a long term buy and hold for me.
859 2018-02-01 18:11:13 While history doesn't repeat itself, it does rhyme.  This market is like 1994, when rates kept rising until something broke.  In that case, Orange County. #Leverage is so extended, I suspect a 3% ten year will break a few things.  Meanwhile stocks continue their unwitting climb.
860 2018-02-01 18:10:28 How are your personal stocks doing?There is more money in your paycheck but wait until state and local taxes go up to make up the deficit.

862 2018-02-01 18:09:47 Obama's numbers don't lie either...take a look at them, personally my stocks just about tripled under Obama and unemployment was slashed almost in half, you're either a bot or just very stupid.
863 2018-02-01 18:09:43 Money is pouring out of Crypto’s into Stocks. Healthy rotation
864 2018-02-01 18:09:38 Any bar which stocks these as standard, as long as people didn't interpret it to mean that particular bar has a higher rate of date rapes than other bars, should do amazingly well. I'd happily pay a few pennies more per drink to cover cost
865 2018-02-01 18:09:07 Haha I truly want to be typecast as a weird newscaster in indie movies somehow lol

869 2018-02-01 18:07:42 Stocks were down almost sold out of a number of positions. Instead took dogs for long walk cane back and dow up 100. Volatility is back

873 2018-02-01 18:07:04 Wendy, the stock market more than doubled under President Obama, so either you didn't have a 401k and you're lying or you suck at choosing stocks...

Either option makes you deplorable -- good thing you're proud of it.
874 2018-02-01 18:06:41 hahah i love it . "weed stocks are going to crash"  ... couple days later " buy weed stocks!!"

Except for the constant reference to Wall Street Stocks that mainly benefit Rich you & GOP. They dont pay anything to lesson the deficit. It was entertaing

880 2018-02-01 18:04:48 The greatest bull market in history, 1982-1999. Average real returns for stocks were 13.6%. REAL returns. - Siegel #NationalLINC
881 2018-02-01 18:04:46 A number of #BitCoin #BLC type stocks are popping off their recent lows already today in anticipation of possible/imminent upward move in #BTC (as evidenced in the fact that #CNBC actually relented in there neg commentary & said something pos today). Still buyin the dippers, tho
882 2018-02-01 18:04:06 And stocks could care less, why would they when they have been nationalized by the fed?
883 2018-02-01 18:04:06 I do have stocks amd have recently go into crypto. Im studying TA every night after work amd following u guys and analysing everything. But u didnt answer my question if BTC falls to a certaim “low” are or which ALT coin would be or are in danger??
884 2018-02-01 18:04:02 AIM,you cannot win in a market when someone is buying and selling at a loss just to bring the share price down.Looking very obvious on a lot of different AIM stocks today.
885 2018-02-01 18:02:28 Why bother worrying about it when you could be buying all these cheap stocks?
886 2018-02-01 18:01:30 Fully agree, thanks so much for the feedback. We want to be as inclusive as possible for talent. Thats why we exist, to help talent who might not have got lucky or be great at marketing themselves.
887 2018-02-01 18:01:05 Probably you need a better fund manager or should have chosen better stocks.  Second, from 2009-2016, mine was up anywhere between 10-20% annually.  Third, this is earnings season...things may not be looking up for much longer given the last few trading sessions
888 2018-02-01 17:59:56 401K is only as good as the stock market (thank you Obama mines been growing since 2009) but as soon as the market crashes in 1987 the gains are lost. This typically will happen when the stocks are overpriced
889 2018-02-01 17:58:27 now after donnies buddies have bought the stocks to make the market rise, when they start selling all that stock to get their profits, we are liable to have a bigger crash than 1929.
890 2018-02-01 17:57:53 A lot of stocks are fading.  Even $AMZN
891 2018-02-01 17:57:35 #NHSenate votes party lines 14-9 interim study (to kill) SB 492 which would have prohibited dangerous bump stocks in NH. Thank you to Senate Democrats who took this to a floor fight and pressed Republicans on public safety in NH #NHPolitics #nh #gunsense

894 2018-02-01 17:56:59 PORTFOLIO flat on the day - really can't complain as several big hits but offset by a few big gains. Noticeable that weak Stocks are getting lot weaker in current climate. Some big intraday swings as well.
895 2018-02-01 17:55:51 Why not make the Dow 30 the 30 fastest rising stocks that day? Then it would always go up and people who prefer fantasy over fact will always be happy! 
896 2018-02-01 17:55:50 true.. but what stocks is the more important point to get across. :-) but yeah true statement for sure
897 2018-02-01 17:55:02 LOVE MY PRESIDENT!!! He's the inspiration for @MAGA !!! He builds up his administration... builds up the American people...and takes care of the nation like no other!!! Bringing jobs back to the ppl... blows the stocks to unseen heights @MAGA

899 2018-02-01 17:54:50 Check out this book, so you can start your market studies: How I made $2m in the Stock Market by Nicolas Darvas. I think it’s free online. Darvas was a professional ballroom dancer who made tons of money speculating in stocks during the 1950s.
900 2018-02-01 17:54:18 One of America's biggest issues is that we try to judge the success and well-being of our country based on the stock market, even though plenty of Americans do not own or cannot afford to buy stocks.

That isn't the health of a country. That's the health of stockholders.
901 2018-02-01 17:54:06 .@TheNHSenate refers bill banning bump stocks to interim study in 14-9 party line vote, w/all Dems opposed. They want a study commission w/stakeholders. @SenJeffWoodburn declares fact bill wasn't killed outright "a great day for those who favor common sense gun regulation"
902 2018-02-01 17:54:05 I’m just lucky they do multipack after 8s or I’d never be as 1/2 as productive. That’s why my fees remain reasonable - cheaper to buy the multipacks than those single ones everyone stocks up on in December...
903 2018-02-01 17:53:51 Did I run you off the set BG? Come on crab, I'm bored sitting her watching stocks soar. Let's talk about that whack ass 80's NBA mustache.
904 2018-02-01 17:53:46 On straight party line vote, NH Senate votes to "interim study" a ban on bump stocks. Democrats wanted a commission to more thoroughly study options. GOP majority argued ATF already looking into bump stocks #nhpolitics
905 2018-02-01 17:53:43 If you don’t understand stocks....I don’t blame you
906 2018-02-01 17:53:41 In 5 years, he made, I can not invest in Gold, PF, PPF, Banks , MF and finally in stocks.
Only left  for me "Horse racing". I like Gujarat model of development pushing middle class to below BPL.
907 2018-02-01 17:53:35 Correct.  The inbred morons running the show have Americans trained to cheer for higher prices from stocks to GDP, making everything less affordable and wiping out your standard of living. 

It's truly an Orwellian orchestration of "education" and propaganda, a genuine nightmare.
908 2018-02-01 17:53:33 I Agree. Everyone needs medical coverage. Why Mr @arunjaitley thinks a middle class person is all immune. Non tax payers get govt medical insurance, tax evaders have stocks of black money for medical needs. This is what one gets for honestly paying taxes? #AntiMiddleClassBudget
909 2018-02-01 17:53:28 And stocks could care less!

916 2018-02-01 17:49:42 When there's blood in the streets and people are painking - that's when you should be buying stocks. Sure wish I had a bigger pile of cash to put to work ... #potstocks
917 2018-02-01 17:49:30 Ok I accept everything you are saying. In that case I would say maybe reword your marketing and Twitter page. It comes across that your only accepting certain people from certain school. It comes across exclusive not inclusive :) Just something to think about :)

925 2018-02-01 17:46:45 'Stocks can suck for a long, long time. Thinking that you’re mentally prepared for this type of environment is not enough.' I think far fewer than 1% of people are prepared for 16 years of going nowhere. Shows the importance of diversification of strategies and asset classes.

927 2018-02-01 17:45:37 Keep an eye on VIX and S&P500, which are inversely correlated. Crytpo will follow stocks imo.
928 2018-02-01 17:45:19 Fine with the "fire the HF" answer, but maybe a state Investment Board should take less pride in its investment ignorance. Also, bonds and stocks can fall simultaneously, it's called the 1970s.

940 2018-02-01 17:41:35 Some good news: The head of the CDC resigned over her tobacco stocks. 'Cause the CDC is a national leader in the fight against tobacco.
941 2018-02-01 17:41:32 Yesterday because of the revelation that the supposed anti-smoking CDC head was buying cigarette manufacturing stocks. Can't make this moral corruption up. Truly deplorable.
942 2018-02-01 17:41:24 Yeah. Agreed. Just scary times to be holding pot stocks. Last year was way better!

944 2018-02-01 17:41:08 Yes, the crumbs will add up for a few years- before it ends for them anyway-  Big Money tax breaks go forever.  But- Y'all will be long gone by then.  Sooner, I suspect.  While the pillaging continues- stocks soar- citizens go w/out basic necessities- planet goes to ruins.

948 2018-02-01 17:40:09 Who the fuck keeps buying stocks at those levels? 
#wallstreet #nyse
949 2018-02-01 17:39:49 This trend has nothing to do with you. Also, the top 10% of Americans own 81% of the stocks, so this doesn’t even help everyone. Stop tweeting about it!
950 2018-02-01 17:39:47 Gee, seems funny the ‘market’ took a 2day nosedive just before #SOTU address and is now back on its upward trajectory. Certainly no one would initiate a big sell off in order to manipulate stocks in order to make Trump look bad, would they?
951 2018-02-01 17:39:40 I think the same. But really bad for those who have been holding their stocks for a long time and saw lower circuits/ big falls in the last week or so.
952 2018-02-01 17:39:35 And you need to respect the will of the people...the only stupid one is you...donate all your stocks and investments to a good cause, since you apparently don't enjoy the raise you recently got!  HYPOCRITE!
953 2018-02-01 17:39:24 Men, now‘s the time to drop your girls. You know that tax return is coming, and she’s gonna want something nice. Instead invest it in stocks bonds gold and land. Turn that money into more money boys.
954 2018-02-01 17:38:52 Stocks, investing, crypto.  If you do invest make sure you spread it out.  Because it balances things out if some of your stocks go down.
955 2018-02-01 17:38:34 The way things are going for last Couple weeks. I would not jump in weeds stocks. Look at me im in blood sea . Stay away from them for time being.
956 2018-02-01 17:38:07 Same questions could apply to buying stocks.
957 2018-02-01 17:37:53 Yup, traditionally a great stock mkt metaphor, just not in utilities. Those are the stocks that little old ladies only drive to church on Sundays.
958 2018-02-01 17:37:13 Better to buy all stocks which was recommended by Sir . And forgot one stock for LTCG .Nothing wrong to pay tax

Our mission is to help actors who have spent years training & are thousands of £'s in debt and don't have agents.
963 2018-02-01 17:34:17 If Senate Republicans don’t want to pass prohibition on bumps stocks because want national approach, then how about #NHSenate sends letter to ATF calling for more regulations on devices that mimic machine guns #nhpolitics #nh #gunsense
964 2018-02-01 17:33:27 Right
965 2018-02-01 17:33:24 Good point.  I was thinking that its a bit different in 2 ways.  1) magnitude -quoting 20% of the time on a stock that represents less than 1% of volume to get 1 mil rebate (um, discount) on ALL stocks.  Second, it is a subsidy of the LISTINGS (regulatory) business from trading,
966 2018-02-01 17:33:19 Long term capital gain on mutual funds and stocks. Education cess raised to 4%! And many more on common items!

1038 2018-02-01 17:09:49 one theory of the timing of the dot com bubble bursting in march was that the holiday season just prior induced family members rushed to purchase stocks. timing doesn't seem that far off for the crypto market

1040 2018-02-01 17:09:09 @jimcramer - I read your article about $nvda - Great company but you sold few stocks.. So does that mean no juice left ??? Last time you predicted that it will pull back 10% based on fibbonacci and it was right on point.. Can you please share your guidance.

1044 2018-02-01 17:08:09 The stock market is great! ....for people who have stocks. Respectfully, what's great for ppl who don't?
1045 2018-02-01 17:07:53 Not playing Indices for quiet some time cause stocks are giving much better returns and moves. 
I liquidated all my longs on 15th and went shorts stock specific ( intimated on my TL as well )
Actual traders are aware of carnage in stocks from that date till today.

1054 2018-02-01 17:05:51 Coz pharma stocks in the US took a pounding the day before. There was some news on valeant (scam company) which spooked the companies
1055 2018-02-01 17:05:47 I was talking about the cassette players. In Reading we have 2 Oxfam shops, one of which sells CD, LPs etc. It also stocks old hifi equipment. I was think about donating my cassette player there.

1060 2018-02-01 17:03:45 I don’t like Trump as our president, but the only thing beneficial I see that he has done was benefit our economy. If you are interested in stocks, this is the best time to invest in one. The stock market has legit been booming since he got into office. 
1061 2018-02-01 17:03:43 Mr. Ziger, in light of the market correction MMJ took the biggest hit out of all cannabis stocks. I would highly recommend releasing concrete market news when this correction is over to avoid losing any more market cap.

1068 2018-02-01 17:01:36 Forgot to mention picked up some $KAT & $AZ yesterday at the eod. $KAT looks to be oversold on the rsi, comfortable with my entry here - add later. $AZ showing a strong chart, price action typically runs. Zinc futures strong as well. #tradeideas #stocks
1069 2018-02-01 17:00:35 Liberals 2016-Trump is going to drive stocks into the ground and ruin our economy.

Liberals 2018- Trump has nothing to do with the economy
1070 2018-02-01 17:00:32 More like the fact that capitalism stopped playing a progressive role in society (as it did from mid 18th to mid 20th century). Instead of profits driving technological progress, they spill into various sectors that add nothing to the output of the economy - bitcon, stocks etc.
1071 2018-02-01 17:00:31 Sounds like some shit you would do if you were the boss haha
1072 2018-02-01 17:00:23 Ex non-earners? I’ve found that to be more reliable than assuming you’re owning stocks that will never have earners
1073 2018-02-01 17:00:12 First day of month money coming in - PM's have to decide stocks vs bonds........and stocks rally. And I made a lucky bet

1075 2018-02-01 16:59:52 Well said - "What's going down will keep going down"

Because that's what stocks as an asset class do.. They "TREND" (Up Down or Sideways)
1076 2018-02-01 16:59:43 Hey Tim.  Were you high when you recommended the Canadian pot stocks on Fast Money?  They have been falling faster than Trumps pants at a beauty pageant.
1077 2018-02-01 16:59:37 Invest in stocks
1078 2018-02-01 16:59:24 I agree, already real estate down, FD rates low, no hike in income tax exemption, only positive was stocks, going forward won't rise much or may even fall bad !!!
1079 2018-02-01 16:58:34 Pour les adeptes du Green ou juste les autres: Lidl fait une offre de  sur la gamme Nature des produits Cien. Pas beaucoup de stocks donc dépêchez-vous !

1081 2018-02-01 16:58:07 Superb weakness coming from the pot stocks and others who will give us bargains we;d never thought possible in time.
1082 2018-02-01 16:57:44 Let H&M keep falling in Stocks... What happen when a company has a fall, niggas get the IPO for dirt Cheap 
1083 2018-02-01 16:57:37 Great trade morning with Lewis and the team at Witney CPS met up with stocks Plumbing&heating busy guys
1084 2018-02-01 16:57:35 Not all Americans who have 401k’s are rich.  We are a middle class family who worked hard for what we have and we invested our money in stocks which are doing great.  We are thankful for that.  Americans voted and Trumpbecame our POTUS.  Get over it!
1085 2018-02-01 16:57:33 I imagine it worked alright for them because they sell lots of hunting rifles with traditional walnut stocks and the like. i.e. weapons that are symbols of the ancient leisure class and not discriminated against.

They probably wanted to be able to use scary black plastic tho'.

1089 2018-02-01 16:56:32 I'm very invested in stocks but I watch them way more carefully than in the past and I own, for the most part, quality dividend paying stocks.
1090 2018-02-01 16:56:28 Just a 10% reduction in winter #WHEAT yields would take U.S. ending stocks down by nearly 25% year over year- and with crop dealing with *both* a drought & polar temps, yields could be seen down even more than 10%.

1095 2018-02-01 16:55:36 I feel pretty strongly about this one. No one at my little pub can own cryptos due to the massive chance of bias; the same reason that journos put the 401ks into index funds and not individual stocks. You can't avoid ALL conflict, but you can avoid obvious shit.
1096 2018-02-01 16:55:29 Great advice for a new investor. I think doing this helps one pay attention and learn the market to eventually make those decision on individual stocks.

1098 2018-02-01 16:54:44 Um sorry there are no stock buy backs in the 10q. It would be ludicrous for a company burning cash to use cash to buyback stocks
1099 2018-02-01 16:54:41 The article shows how competing companies in other counties have bashed the new tariffs, but at the every end it creates juxtaposition by saying how stocks in both solar power and washing machines (plus 200 jobs) have gone up sines the declaration form Trump.
1100 2018-02-01 16:54:32 @TraderStef Hi Stef
I follow you and being a Cyber Architect thought you'ld be interested in why long-term shorting or selling of cloud stocks is on the table.
They are the most at risk from the Meltdown & Spectre CPU problems and face inherent severe security/performance issues
1101 2018-02-01 16:54:14 So you're saying there was another reason private prison stocks jumped on November 9, 2016 beyond the obvious "Trump will try to pass and enforce cruel laws."
1102 2018-02-01 16:53:31 Its sad indeed. I atleast for one, dont’t invest in stocks to make an “income”. All that I want to do is protect what already earned (paying tax to govt) from inflation. A good govt should enable its citizens to do this. I suppose the US has instruments like TIPS
1103 2018-02-01 16:53:16 I can see that, I just don't really see a strong technical level at .32 - what are you basing that on? Also it's bouncing pretty well now. And is well under its latest PP. I like buying stocks cheaper than "Smart money"
1104 2018-02-01 16:53:11 Annnd there goes the #mj stocks. Keeping an eye on $Weed.to $ACB.to $OGI.v and $FIRE.v for L-T hold. Not a buyer yet, think $weed.to goes below $25. could be a great opportunity heading into legalization. #PotStocks #retireyoung #BUYTHEDIP
1105 2018-02-01 16:52:39 I wake up everyday ready to look at my stocks
1106 2018-02-01 16:51:26 Trading stocks is very stressful, but my god I wonder how it feels to be bag holding cryptos lol

1109 2018-02-01 16:50:30 What’s worse is that every prior CDC Director had/has huge stocks in Pharmaceuticals. And then went and bought more after they left and got key positions within Pharma after their CDC job. This is far worse than her tobacco stocks. Far.
1110 2018-02-01 16:50:27 facebook bans crypto ads. now in place of them i have a picture of trump telling me about the must have yuge NYSE stocks.....

1112 2018-02-01 16:49:48 Believing that someone can pick stocks with accuracy is like believing in unicorns......keep selling that dream!!!!
1113 2018-02-01 16:49:38 Hi Nina! Stocks po. 
1114 2018-02-01 16:49:36 And HR 1144 isn’t called the ‘Tax Wall Street’ Act. It taxes sales of stocks and bonds.

This graphic is really misleading!

Which I know is stating the obvious.
1115 2018-02-01 16:49:33 Canopy down to $28 bucks and change...could be all the hype / air is coming out of weed stocks and people are realizing valuations are crazy

1117 2018-02-01 16:48:35 I have my friend.. that's why m saying.. I know both the things.. making ten lac through stocks and salaried.. everybody takes risk.. salaried guy should pay tax coz less risk involved, what's this? Just because there's risk involved in stock it should be tax free.. I don't agree
1118 2018-02-01 16:48:25 It's the only way I buy or #Not buy my stocks. Charts speak volumes, know things before the news is released and they never lie. #TA
1119 2018-02-01 16:48:19 Count me in, @Tom_Stocks!
1120 2018-02-01 16:48:10 yeah typical movement of stocks but hey let the noobs sell for cheap so that the longs can grab more. Thanks!!!!
1121 2018-02-01 16:48:02 That $GBPAUD trade didnt follow through and crack (as expected with asshole $AUD pairs). What I love about Fx is you get to know the pairs in no time and what to be cautious of. unlike stocks.... you have no idea what you are dealing with each time something new comes up.
1122 2018-02-01 16:47:50 @PatrickWalker56 - With the market having gone up so much, I am sometimes challenged to find individual stocks that meet my criteria.  So I'm in a decent amount of cash.  Meanwhile, the market marches up.  How do you handle that?  Stick excess cash in an etf?
1123 2018-02-01 16:47:39 If you take profits, then there is no real reason to hedge your trade. #Stocks
1124 2018-02-01 16:47:30 good time to buy Take Two stocks.
1125 2018-02-01 16:46:51 If you happen to invest through the #Robinhood app pls ignore the predatory articles they post about Marijuana stocks and #Crypto currency. Those aren’t wise investments. In fact, you should run away from anyone who advises you otherwise.
1126 2018-02-01 16:46:19 Did I miss the boat on $mzor? What's your cutoff point on buying key list stocks breaking out?
1127 2018-02-01 16:45:59 thanks for link
1998 to date seems returns on investments (stocks/warrents/& even bonds) = little more than pump-&-dump #HYPE . Huge media giants & clearinghouses - project into the public sphere the self-serving projections of value & potentials

1130 2018-02-01 16:43:52 BRB. Shorting the VG company stocks. 
1131 2018-02-01 16:43:27 83% of the stocks are owned by 1%. 82% of the wealth generated in the world last year went to the richest 1%. And when you own that large of a market segment, its pretty easy to manipulate. Every sale has a buyer. The bag holders are seldom if ever the 1%...

1134 2018-02-01 16:42:19 I get it, I just don't see it being consistent or lasting much longer. It's just one of those things that some people got really lucky on but that's how stocks work. Even Amazon and Apple were penny stocks at one point. I think it'll phase out before too long
1135 2018-02-01 16:42:15 @PaisteNation looking for a NY\Long Island based retailer that stocks a good selection of cymbals, most (sam ash, guitar center, etc) have an extremely limited selection of 2002 line.  Is there a local showroom that showcases many different models.

1174 2018-02-01 16:30:48 You are absolutely right. Low churn will result in optimal tax results. Otherwise even a 10 percent tax can have a cascading impact on your retirement portfolio. Only quality stocks enable one to keep churn low, investors will realize and bid up such stocks.

1181 2018-02-01 16:27:54 You dont really own anything.. its like investing in stocks of a company you believe are developing a good product and will actually solve a problem and will be the best ones to do it
1182 2018-02-01 16:27:47 Thank you very much and well done to everyone else.
1183 2018-02-01 16:27:39 The props have been battered for most of 2016 and 2017. Stocks now at an all-time low would not be an exaggeration. Need to change the selection policy to pick from Europe.
1184 2018-02-01 16:27:14 You very well could be right. But how far does $TSRO fall before that happens? Not my style to hold downtrending stocks in hopes of a buyout, regardless of value. Learned that lesson the hard way many years ago.
1185 2018-02-01 16:27:00 @maddow It may seem crazy, but Japan Tobacco is the name of a Pharmaceutical firm in Japan. It doesn't make the CDC Chair's behavior any better, but she was investing not specifically in tobacco, but in pharma stocks.

1205 2018-02-01 16:20:32 Well I think it's more than that. It was created to decentralize funds and protect and make transactions more fluid and anonymous. Buying and selling is no different than stocks. Tech stocks are overvalued by speculation and investment much like crypto (Bitcoin)

1228 2018-02-01 16:13:11 Buying a home is almost always a worse investment than investing in the stock market. You're borrowing 5-10 times the money you're investing and you have to maintain payments for 30 years or the bank takes your home. Renting and investing in stocks is almost always a better move.

2) Declining stocks

1545 2018-02-01 14:41:43 #LTCG makes no sense, not even in a matured freemarket. Here is why.
1. Unlike fixed income securities, stocks are risk capital & investors in the stockmarket run the risk of capital loss. 
2. Only ace investors earn 15% p.a. & higher on their investments. @PChidambaram_IN @Nidhi

1551 2018-02-01 14:39:19 My call on stocks for 2018:

1. Major downside risk
2. Take your profits
3. Stock Market has now maxed out
4. Diversify into bonds and international markets
5. Inflation for Main Street and lower stocks for Wall Street is a bad combination
1552 2018-02-01 14:39:16 you're 100% right about being naturally long in the company you work for... But stocks usually experience a short term gain after layoffs.

1566 2018-02-01 14:34:01 Unfortunately majority of Americans don’t have stocks & are living paycheck to paycheck & can’t afford college sav accts what about them?
1567 2018-02-01 14:33:57 Thanks for the update Greg. Twitter is crypto world. Seems like there actual stocks are rising since the big run with crypto too. Gotta get them Facebook followers here..
1568 2018-02-01 14:33:44 The US stock market looks like it’s trying to roll over, moves half my portfolio to international stocks and municipal bonds. Take your profits people
1569 2018-02-01 14:32:56 Yeah, you can definitely say the same thing about the stock market, but currencies are supposed to be inherently more stable than stocks. Bitcoin isn't and can't be. 

Think of all the poor idiots who paid for pizza deliveries in Silicon Valley with bitcoin ten years ago.

1572 2018-02-01 14:32:25 It's known. SM has 20.6 shares of IRiver that makes them second biggest shareholder between other shareholders. Not BigHit but also Jyp will get their contract pay for it.They dont have stocks or shares. So it is like SM and SK are Melon, the others are contracted companies

1574 2018-02-01 14:31:08 @realDonaldTrump  CNBC discovers that good times in the stock market existed during the Obama years. Good times did not suddenly begin 11/8/2016 as some 'fact challenged' folks believe.  "BREAKING: Dow futures fall 200 points after stocks post their best month since March 2016"
1575 2018-02-01 14:31:04 Even better for the richest 2% of the country, who own over 80% of the stocks. Daddy’s tax cuts were a sham. 

And, what do you actually do, again??
1576 2018-02-01 14:30:32 I see a lot of people tweet stocks and people buy in... Then the stock pulls back a few weeks later and the original people pumping it are no where to be found or won't respond to peoples tweets about it or disclose their position... Just know you are buying their bag... fyi

1941 2018-02-01 11:30:01 I have a very bad feeling on our economy.  If you've got the chance, don't spend for anything nonessential and keep your eyes open.  This boon on stocks is precarious.  It really is.  Hang tight, be smart and let's hope for the best.  Invest wisely and watch out.
1942 2018-02-01 11:29:42 Gains on your equity mutual fund/stocks will be taxed even after 1-year of holding period. 
Don’t panic! Tax only @10% and applicable to gains greater than Rs 1 Lakh.

1943 2018-02-01 11:29:31 Yes I can....  Everyone was knowing that market will fall after budget but they were looking for safe stocks to short... Pharma never got anything from budget.... So it was the safest bet to short

2180 2018-02-01 08:44:51 Seems like effective date for imposition of Long term capital gains tax on selling equity MF and stocks will be from 31st July , 2018 onwards. Market recovers. Also, even when you sell after Jul,18, tax will be charged only on gains made after 31st Jan #LTCG #Budget2018

U.S. stocks gave up earlier gains to trade lower on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve said it sees inflation rising this year, signaling it remains on track to boost interest rates again in March.

Asian indexes traded mostly higher on Thursday after stocks in the region sold off earlier this week. The moves also followed moderate gains on Wall Street following the Federal Reserve's decision to keep rates unchanged.

2305 2018-02-01 07:54:12 Personally I am happy with Long Term Capital Gain Tax on stocks.People were making profits in crores but were not paying even one rupee tax.
2306 2018-02-01 07:53:21 An index of Asian shares swung into negative territory on Thursday, erasing earlier gains, as a late retreat in Chinese stocks pulled the benchmark lower and as concerns about rising interest rates softened investor sentiment.
2307 2018-02-01 07:53:20 Moreover, gains upto 31.1.2018  in stocks held will continue to be exempted

2321 2018-02-01 07:47:53 No, even after the tax, Indian equities still look the rosiest amongst all and other asset classes don't even come close. Further, the boost to rural economy and infra with the extra funds is also positive for stocks and earnings recovery.

2332 2018-02-01 07:44:29 Now we understand the reason for drop in midcaps/smallcaps in last 2-3 weeks. Looks like big players already knew abt this or somehow sensed it. 

Happy that LTCG drama is over now. Back to value investing. Midcaps  stocks should start their upward journey here onwards.
2333 2018-02-01 07:44:23 10% LTCG tax

Pro - Reduces use of 0% LTCG route for money laundering. Converting black to white becomes tougher. I like this.

Con - Attractiveness of listed equities vs other asset classes reduces. Stocks need to be valued lower to generate the same post-tax return as earlier.

2350 2018-02-01 07:38:28 Another negative for mutual funds. Equity oriented mutual funds to have a dividend distribution tax of 10%. This is to bring it on parity with the new LTCG of 10% on stocks. @rupeeiq #UnionBudget2018 #Budget2018
2351 2018-02-01 07:37:52 Hi Jo. Really interesting. I think it is a great strategy to own a basket of junior stocks. There aren't many! Hope you're right about the tide turning, we've been through a lot of pain. I'd be interested if you favour one in particular and why.
2352 2018-02-01 07:37:46 How can you have STT and capital gains at the same time?
If mutual funds have dividend distribution tax, isn't it better to invest directly in stocks?
2353 2018-02-01 07:37:06 Stocks and bonds, welcome to the party but a bail out is nothing but fiduciary jail
2354 2018-02-01 07:36:55 Yes, but creating disparity (DDT ONLY for equity oriented funds and NOT for direct stocks) is a bummer!
2355 2018-02-01 07:36:52 Bhai log no LTCG till 31/1/2018

2402 2018-02-01 07:17:13 I really don't think repatriation will spur investment. It'll mostly boost stocks and dividends. The companies with offshore cash have been able to borrow against it, effectively giving them access to that cash this whole time. The tax cut does more than the influx of cash

2629 2018-02-01 05:37:58 Do you own stocks? It's short of amazing what's happening right now. Of course it's all subject to falling. Just like yesterday with Amazon and company announced they're going into the health insurance business. Medical stocks tanked. DOW was down big time.
2630 2018-02-01 05:37:56 To not over trade. Like you said sometimes the best trade is no trade at all. First month trading penny stocks on small account. Lost $240. Learning from my mistakes to cut losses quickly and to trade my plan. Hope is not a strategy. Still studying every chance I get.
2631 2018-02-01 05:37:06 The big up / down days do tend to happen within the same windows... a sign of volatility which is increased historically when stocks are in a down trend. But to your point, if a concern one option is to just put less of your portfolio in a trend model.

2700 2018-02-01 04:59:01 As long as they can dangle tax cuts/high stocks/ good economy in front of people, and share enough of the public trough they’re drinking from, they feel sheltered. Some are getting out before the economy turns. It’s corruption like we’ve never seen before, and it’s contagious.

2739 2018-02-01 04:40:07 Layoffs are happening, stocks are up because corporations are engaging in stock buybacks rather than creating jobs. It looks good, statistically, for a short time, until the bubble bursts.
2740 2018-02-01 04:40:01 Exactly what about real-world experience requires you to make stock trades in tobacco stocks while you are in office? This wasn't stuff for Senate confirmation hearings. It was after she was confirmed and took office.

2742 2018-02-01 04:39:20 I’ve been so into reading about stocks lately, I’m really pushing myself to learn about investing in them.
2743 2018-02-01 04:37:57 We are ready with funds, if market do anything stupid today we will be adding our already researched picks agressively.

Overall trend will remain positive for 2018, use panic to add good stocks from fertilizer, infra and tier 2/3 real estate sector.
2744 2018-02-01 04:37:01 Same. My dad managed an A & P grocery store for 40 years. My mom was a housewife. We were always strapped, but we were hard working and disciplined. No inheritance, no stocks, no handouts, and proudly liberal. Dad always would say, "That's the party that works for the workers."
2745 2018-02-01 04:36:50 plz someone tell me which stocks to invest in so i don’t fail this assignment

2756 2018-02-01 04:32:31 OTC Markets' companies, previously 4.81% of the index, now make up 7.5% - likely due to smaller stocks surging
2757 2018-02-01 04:31:37 Is it profitable to trade futures? Do you make adequate amount of profits on it? I don't see anybody trading futures, usually it's just stocks, and some do forex trading, and I did see mentions of options, but no futures - besides you, that is.

2760 2018-02-01 04:30:13 Stocks haha
2761 2018-02-01 04:30:03 At least the CDC director stepped down for trading tobacco stocks. This Admin can't get 24 hrs of positive press covefe w/o a scandal
2762 2018-02-01 04:30:03 Stocks is a game worth playing & definately a gamble worth taking...
2763 2018-02-01 04:29:23 US India Business model pt is such an eye opener, not many talk or think abt it. The talked abt stocks' business model looking so good though, it was on my watchlist as well n to b honest seeing it going up was giving a missed out feeling,not any more :)
2764 2018-02-01 04:29:03 Only downside to today is the fact that my stocks dropped  c'mon

2773 2018-02-01 04:26:15 #Trump's CDC head fired for insider trading on tobacco stocks and it's not even mentioned....he's had like 3 or 4 blatant racists kicked out of his administration in the last month that would be yuge stories for anyone else...barely mentioned..
2774 2018-02-01 04:26:10 Stock has little to do with economy and jobs in truck loads a blatant lie.  Stocks closed sharply lower on Tuesday, falling for a second day as the first major sell-off of the new year intensified.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 362.59 points to finish at 26,076.89.

2784 2018-02-01 04:18:54 Not that it would happen, but there are exchanges for crypto for euros, other crypto currencies, and other physical currencies. I guess technically if the dollar was gone, it would crash the market pretty hard. Just like stocks.

2786 2018-02-01 04:18:26 For day trading stocks the daily chart is your best friend, for swinging it’s the weekly & for investing it’s the monthly, but it’s in your best interest as a technician to at least get a glimpse of what’s happening on all of them.
2787 2018-02-01 04:18:13 1/Not to be picky, but if you analyze returns on a rolling 10-year basis, the worst 10-years were for the period ending May 1920, where stocks lost a real -6.09% a year. 2nd worst was the 10-years ending Feb, 2009, with a real loss of -5.86% a year.
2788 2018-02-01 04:18:08 I think bringing back the stocks and pillory and public ridicule might be a lot more enjoyable
2789 2018-02-01 04:15:23 Nice, that does sound pretty good. I'll have to try that soon. The broths I normally use are just simple stocks, but I've been slowly getting into more Asian flavors. Thinking about trying steamed pork buns soon too.

2808 2018-02-01 04:07:27 You try to talk down to ppl who prove you wrong. You need to learn to get facts straight.The CDC head was removed because of stocks in tobacco.Conflict of interest. Don't let hate rule you objectivity
2809 2018-02-01 04:06:57 She was in charge of the CDC and bought 10’s of thousands of dollars in stock of big tobacco companies.... that isn’t really that “complex.”  Throw in some big pharma and healthcare stocks and you have a Trump Cabinet A player!
2810 2018-02-01 04:06:37 Cement stocks have corrected a lot: Watch out for them. Eg: Ultratech shows rounding bottom in hour chart. Above 4400, it could attempt in a day or three 4600. Ambuja cement has been holding 255.
2811 2018-02-01 04:06:26 80% of all stocks are owned by the too10%. We need WAGE growth. Wealthy tend to hold onto most of the capital. We need middle class to earn and spend.

2820 2018-02-01 04:00:06 Imposition of LTCG on stocks for domestic investors while giving exception to foreign investors will drive domestic funds out of stock markets. Our dependence on foreign funds will increase. It will be a regressive step.

I understand when it had smaller cap of pricing future growth, but 700 billion market cap stocks should be more sane. Bubbles do still exist
2823 2018-02-01 03:57:32 De-gasification of some storied stocks is on in full swing. Increase in margin on brokers acting as the needle for that balloon. Every bull market has it's share of bull @$#@.

2854 2018-02-01 03:41:44 Fitzgerald is now out as CDC director, following reports that she bought tobacco stocks while in office — something that runs counter to the CDC’s public health mission. And another one bites the dust 
2855 2018-02-01 03:41:27 When are we going to see tech stocks listing?
2856 2018-02-01 03:41:22 Only the BEST people! Are they ticked she bought tobacco stocks or cuz she traded on the job?

2858 2018-02-01 03:40:55 I can’t think of any allegory more apt than that Trump’s head of CDC (ie in charge of the public’s health, a sacred mission) was trading tobacco stocks while on the job.
2859 2018-02-01 03:39:42 Brenda Fitzgerald was no doubt going to manipulate CDC policy to boost her tobacco stocks. What were her policy changes?  IG must investigate
2860 2018-02-01 03:39:38 True, true. Hey, are you familiar with Belvie Chocolate in HCM City? There's a tiny coffee shop in the McGill Metro that stocks it.

2866 2018-02-01 03:37:05 Well that "speculation" has paid for my home and every ounce of debt I had so I will at least be investing in stocks if/when the crypto market does what you are stating.
2867 2018-02-01 03:35:38 “it’s far more likely they went up because of something Obama did.” Stocks are predicted mainly off sense of stability. And MANY loud mouths predicted instability before Trump got elected. But they were wrong. Had nothing to do with Obama.

2905 2018-02-01 03:18:56 Absolutely dead wrong--ECRI has just called and re-affirmed cyclical slowdown dead ahead.

2920 2018-02-01 03:10:48 I agreed. At least they can take what they are dishing out. I don't normally speak up but crypto is bringing new attention to investors/traders that wouldn't normally invest. If crypto fails then we will at least have a better handle on how to invest and may shift back to stocks.
2921 2018-02-01 03:09:21 Stocktaker would take your stocks, don’t talk shit
2922 2018-02-01 03:08:54 From my point of view, and I really don't know anything about stocks, it seems to be about headlines more than anything else. "Facebook is being used less and less!"
2923 2018-02-01 03:07:40 Why yore still replying  though? people with  bonds/stocks/ inheritance don't advertise it all over the net!
2924 2018-02-01 03:05:57 Flowers and candles been my essentials since ive lived alone. And luckily my man loves them too! He dead stocks the house w candles and randomly buys flowers for our place! 
2925 2018-02-01 03:05:50 Well I got a 15% pay increase and bonus stocks due specifically to the tax reform I’m happy. Plus I’ll be lying about $2000 less per yer in taxes per my tax guy I’m happy

2933 2018-02-01 02:59:46 It would be my dream Job to be able to day trade for a living. The issue is that you have to have 25K in your E*TRADE account to pattern day trade or they shut you down. Plus I’ve never been good at trading penny stocks.

2963 2018-02-01 02:47:45 It would do nothing of the sort. Are you new to the mentality of Trump supporters? The rich ones, the greedy misogynistic pig, self-dealers, would blame the Dems

2981 2018-02-01 02:38:45 Investors are record bullish stocks according to some. I don't think that has ended well in the past. In 2012 they were more bearish than in the recession (2009). That worked well for them in 2012. Big miss.

2988 2018-02-01 02:36:30 Yes, but the really, really right decision would have not to buy tobacco stocks at all.

3051 2018-02-01 02:15:15 This is not the time to lose your head, Milbank. Us Democrats (and btw I used to be an independent) HAVE a lot of messages: 1) Trump's economy only works for the already rich! About 80% of all stocks are held by the already rich. So, Trump's blabbering about how good the economy
3052 2018-02-01 02:14:14 The adj can lead to difficulty predicting stocks weekly, but if you look at it over longer time scales it tends to average out.  The avg adj over the last 60 weeks is 0.097.  That's only +.7mb per week.  Not a terrible error.  therefore, best guess and live with it.

3056 2018-02-01 02:13:03 They didn’t. But it’s something that I think can be discussed on multiple levels, not just because of which president is in power. But even now, trump touts the stock market. Sure, it’s great for people who own stocks. But less than 50% of adult Americans actually do.

3066 2018-02-01 02:07:54 FANGS up 20+% IN A MONTH. US Stocks broadly up 5%+ IN A MONTH. As rates rise and Fed telling you they are on the march higher.  R U Kidding?
3067 2018-02-01 02:06:22 If u or anyone you know buying it I will do it I not wasting my stocks cuz i not gonna wear it myself 
3068 2018-02-01 02:05:19 Holy shit. This is the most corrupt administration ever. Ben Carson using his position to directly benefit his family financially. Trump's pick to head CDC busted buying Tobacco stocks, a stock they would have direct control over influencing in their new position.
3069 2018-02-01 02:04:38 2nd factor: What is the size of your position relative to your entire portfolio? If it's really big, it makes sense to nail down some profits ahead of any earnings report. Make it a position size that you're comfortable holding through the news #stocks #investing
3070 2018-02-01 02:03:39 DM@judithpoe Head of CDC resigns when news uncovered she has purchased stocks in tobacco company.
3071 2018-02-01 02:03:12 @marvingermo sir Marvs. what seminar of yours do I need to attend - I want to learn more about stocks.

Blank slate here.
3072 2018-02-01 02:02:48 @FoxNews Well another departure from the Trump administration CDC resigns she got caught doing stock trades illegal stock trades in my opinion another one trying to make a quick buck illegally trading stocks big business billionaires businessman they do this all the time
3073 2018-02-01 02:02:38 Spot on ditto in Venezuela. Collapsed economy but stocks priced in local currency 
3074 2018-02-01 02:01:55 @elonmusk Hey, I'm a moderately broke teenager, so I can't buy your flamethrower (though I really want to). However, I do have a spare $100 to spend on Tesla stocks. Could we make a deal? 
3075 2018-02-01 02:01:38 Loving the slow and steady move up.
3076 2018-02-01 02:01:13 That could be part of the explanation. $AMZN mostly stocks high turnover inventory. If used goods are relatively low turnover, that could be the niche $GME is exploiting.
3077 2018-02-01 02:00:37 Thanks for the good Q. Indeed, no matter what top #stocks you own, it's often a difficult question to answer. Each investor is different, in risk tolerance, profit goals, conviction, knowledge about a particular investment. So, ultimately you must find your own answer
3078 2018-02-01 02:00:28 Talk about something useful. Like, how does the little guy get ahead in a market manipulated by news, fake market numbers, paper stocks, etc. Instead of BS like traffic lights. Reeaally. Dumbazzes
3079 2018-02-01 01:59:19 Do you think somebody who invested in tobacco stocks really supported public health?
3080 2018-02-01 01:58:16 It’s still a fact that as I call it, our economy was a dumpster fire. My point, overall, is that it’s now presented as if there were no jobs created.. like we went 8 years with no jobs created. Or stocks gaining steam. And that’s just not true.
3081 2018-02-01 01:57:18 I’m on a non stop execute mode. Making moves #moves #stocks #investment #hustle #Entrepreneur
3082 2018-02-01 01:57:08 Talk about something useful. Like, how does the little guy get ahead in a market manipulated by news, fake market numbers, paper stocks, etc. Instead of BS like global warming. Reeaally. Dumbazzes
3083 2018-02-01 01:57:07 It will come down with insider trading leaks they will buy low. Then  after monopolizing the stocks they will raise the price.

3097 2018-02-01 01:48:10 Lol I love you guys talking about stocks and 401k. I thought we were talking about law & Order? My 401k increases under obama were stellar. How’s the 401k for the working class republicans in the Midwest? The coal miners? The unemployed? Man, you’re disconnected. Beep boop beep.
3098 2018-02-01 01:47:28 Which price will $PYPL hit first ?

3110 2018-02-01 01:39:11 I mean it comes down to a few simple rules with ANY investment there will be corrections especially when there are huge run ups even with stocks and housing markets. 1. Only invest money you can afford to lose 2. Be patient. 3. DYOR 4.Stop being salty, doesn't look good bro

3115 2018-02-01 01:36:02 I find it so funny that the head of the CDC resigned after it was revealed she invested in tobacco stocks. Like dude come on.
3116 2018-02-01 01:35:51 I played a few levels on my phone. It’s pretty funny.
3117 2018-02-01 01:35:05 So it’d be a good idea to buy $DIS stocks now
3118 2018-02-01 01:34:39 Yes sir! Will be waiting for the console version, as I did with Slayaway Camp.

3120 2018-02-01 01:34:30 The stock market was proper up by Obama's Fed by printing money giving it to the banks to prop up stocks. Do you know about QE 1,2 or 3? it was a scam to keep them afloat.  It's ok I figured you don't know what you are talking about.
3121 2018-02-01 01:34:21 Buy 200 stocks and you can hit one :)
3122 2018-02-01 01:34:10 So another @POTUS @realDonaldTrump appointee is out. #CDC director resigns because she bought stocks in tobacco and drug companies. Thought #DimwitDonnie would only appoint the brightest, best, most beautiful people. Just another #TrumpLiesMatter. Need #MuellerTime NOW!
3123 2018-02-01 01:34:04 You should stick to stocks Dustin...
3124 2018-02-01 01:33:17 CDC Director quit after it was determined she bought tobacco stocks. Center for Disease Control is supposed to warn against cigarettes smoking.

3141 2018-02-01 01:21:49 @potus, no compromise. We don’t need a ban on the bump stock. There are millions of these stocks in law abiding American’s hands and are used responsibly.  The Vegas murderer was intent on killing. People failed to stop him. Punish the people paid to stop him, not the rest of us.
3142 2018-02-01 01:21:33 Without oil stocks funding exploration we’d soon run out of many oil-based pharmaceuticals and important oil-based plastics used in essential applications. Those shat still were produced would have much higher scarcity-driven prices, damaging millions of people and govt budgets.
3143 2018-02-01 01:21:23 JP Morgan, Amazon, and Berkshire Hathaway are all partnering to create a healthcare company. #healthcare #market #stocks
3144 2018-02-01 01:19:11 $stocks  if you are full throttle and on margin, i'd recommend you ease back and re-evaluate right now.   I'm personally not seeing a significant "edge" outside of of some select names.  Time to protect capital
3145 2018-02-01 01:17:29 So she has investment in tabacco so what’s the scrutiny. Tobacco stocks are losing invest in pot stocks
3146 2018-02-01 01:16:50 IF OBAMA HAD ANYTHING TO DO ABOUT ECONOMIC REBOUND WHY DID HE TANK IN EVERY ECONOMIC COLUMN JOBS BANKING STOCKS BUT AS SOON AS TRUMP WAS ELECTED ALL THIS TURNED AROUND> IM SORRY PEOPLE BUT OBMA HURT OUR ECONOMY NOT REBUILT IT IT WAS ALL TRUMP
3147 2018-02-01 01:15:53 A friend of mine who trades stocks, told me to learn on stock, watch its movements, its patterns and personality and trade it.  I choose crazy crude. It was like nascar and I said to self WTH.  LOL
I learned from a crude trader and heis  awsome but never sees what he sees
3148 2018-02-01 01:15:51 rebalancing periodically to maintain equal weight will require you to buy more of the current "dogs" - but many stocks do come back from temporary problems - so you are not just selling winners, you are buying the current "losers".

3156 2018-02-01 01:11:07 which one of your stocks pay dividends that allow for such?
3157 2018-02-01 01:11:05 Sure Zach. And I'm sure Obama's responsible for 33% increase in stocks, GDP growth, and boarder security too right?
3158 2018-02-01 01:09:53 Hefty losses in health-care and technology companies led U.S. stocks sharply lower Tuesday, handing the market its biggest pullback since August and its worst two-day drop since May.{and so it Begins}
3159 2018-02-01 01:09:29 I wonder if @EPAScottPruitt trades stocks that use air pollution for their accomplishments? 45 still has vested interest in his companies.

3164 2018-02-01 01:04:17 Are you really comparing a congress person owning stocks with government officials who have regulatory control that would affect the stock price? Bernie ain't getting the nomination, bro.
3165 2018-02-01 01:04:07 The richest 10% of Americans own 84% of stocks. I dont think the average American who has 2 now work 2-3 jobs without healthcare, unlike their Chinese counterparts, has any idea of how this country is run. It’s a theatrical facade of sellouts.
3166 2018-02-01 01:03:23 Assume you have a universe with 5,000 stocks.  Assume future returns are randomly distributed among the 5000.  Market cap means you place bigger bets on some than others.  If only 50 of the companies are going to win big going forward, you want equal money in all 5000.
3167 2018-02-01 01:02:09 Thanks for the RT on the top 5 EPS #stocks @america_active $WNC up 37% from the middle of December. Have an awesome day.
3168 2018-02-01 01:02:07 The main idea of crypto is to eliminate the middle man and be in charge of all transactions. Once banks start getting involved, they’re going to fuck the market over like they do with stocks.
3169 2018-02-01 01:00:32 The #Fed Funds Target Rate is currently at 1.375%. In 2008 it was 2%. This is when #Lehman Brothers collapsed. #stocks #debt #history
3170 2018-02-01 01:00:16 Intersting, many companies getting into blockchain technology, as it seems Bitcoin / crptocurrencies prices are falling,,more regulation insure the safety for investors and prevent fraud. In some cases prohibiting the use of cryptocurrency and/or halting trading of public stocks.
3171 2018-02-01 00:59:47 In his SOTU message, he again tried to tell us that he has done wonders for the middle and lower class. Stocks, 401k, and savings programs are all skyrocketing. Well people making 50,000-60,000 most likely don't have stock, and their 401k hs thru their job, as long as they work.
3172 2018-02-01 00:58:49 Thank you for the like and RT of the top 5 EPS #stocks @fitnessbs $ASGN up a whopping 11% on Wednesday. Have an outstanding day.
3173 2018-02-01 00:58:14 Don't confuse things. YOu trumpers are busy destroying the American Dream constantly. Unless you own stocks.
3174 2018-02-01 00:57:43 Just sold some stocks for weed money. This is truly the highest form of Gang shit
3175 2018-02-01 00:57:03 @FoxNews @CNN  CBS News and Survey Director Anthony Salvanto tweeted “Our instant @cbsnews @yougov poll finds strong approval among viewers of SOTU” — 75% fckng %! DNCs n Liberals n billionaires n Elites r furious! Trumps does what he promised! Black unemployment , stocks all!
3176 2018-02-01 00:55:33 Delete it. Guess Patreon & Twitch stocks are spiking today.
3177 2018-02-01 00:55:23 Quality small/midcap stocks are feeling the heat due to madness for such junks.
3178 2018-02-01 00:54:18 And of course Woody probably has lot more free range because he's the top dog. Probably takes a lot of the 'fun' out of messing with Stocks. ...
3179 2018-02-01 00:54:13 Kuha na no? Habang may stocks and size pa. 
3180 2018-02-01 00:53:39 You're not good at you're. Trump is moving the country in the opposite direction of positive. Tourism down wages stagnant GDP underperformed but yeah Dow is up. 80% of stocks owned by 10% people so the autocrat has moved the elite in a positive direction
3181 2018-02-01 00:53:38 Disappointing doesn't even cover it, blatant disrespect to
our hero's that were honored, country and the American Flag. The growth of job's, soaring economy, stocks, lowered unemployment, tax cuts, fixed infrastructure,companies returning to the states,ISIS, tough on immigration.
3182 2018-02-01 00:53:27 $PYPL down 11% after hours time to buy more now and if it hits 70 or below load up.
3183 2018-02-01 00:52:29 2. They don't represent "more" owned by all people added together. It's just leverage over money, it's as if the government printed more money and gave it to people with stocks - hey, that IS what they did, because the quantitative easing raised the market more than Trompe did.
3184 2018-02-01 00:51:52 well FTEC had a nice run up and then gradually dropped down... had you been in initially and set a stop you would have done just fine. Why I find it easier to recommend TSXV or TSX stocks that you can set stops and move em up as needed. Can the CSE please allow stop already?
3185 2018-02-01 00:51:07 then invest in foreign stocks if you are not happy with U.S. Stocks, since you seem to want to compare
3186 2018-02-01 00:50:43 There are other ways to invest other than stocks.    Also other avenues of investment that do rollover money as well.
3187 2018-02-01 00:49:45 He could have tried to push for making bump stocks illegal afterward. He didn't. I also think he could have, at the very least, mentioned the biggest mass shooting in American history, esp since it happened on his watch... But he didn't do that, either. Disgraceful.
3188 2018-02-01 00:49:36 My point is the same here. First, I'm sure you know that correlation is not causation. Yes, stocks are soaring. Is Trump responsible? Maybe. But it's too early to make such claims. Companies coming back to America? There's been a lot of hype, but the new tax law...

3193 2018-02-01 00:47:59 I believe the stocks may become mine too but I’m po y’all 
3194 2018-02-01 00:47:50 1) do you day/swing trade stocks other than commodities?
2) what is your average annual return % approximately (if you care to say)?
3195 2018-02-01 00:47:41 Today very likely saw a s/t floor, but I sure don't expect anything much above $26.75/27.50 zone. The falling sales is a real problem.. and negates the buyback and higher div'. There are simply better tech stocks out there. Valid alt: $CSCO
3196 2018-02-01 00:45:37 And stocks have gone up on Dementia Meds and eye patches (for your daughter one eye that keeps getting smaller everytime she lies)
3197 2018-02-01 00:42:15 It's valuation is 10x sales. Growth seems unlikely to live up to the price. Maybe, tho

47 Chris Kelly - 13 Nichole Warner
26 Buddy Palahnuk - 00 RaeLynn Terrian

3199 2018-02-01 00:42:09 Isn't Pelosi awful. Sour ass face hearing the economy booming stocks high getting job growth & bonuses & more jobs pouring In 359 Billion  repatriated back into our country. She & other Dems act & sounded like Dracula getting burned by the Cross.
3200 2018-02-01 00:41:18 There's more to life than stocks sweetheart.
3201 2018-02-01 00:41:10 The lower your win percentage, the higher your risk to reward ratio is required. And vice-versa!  #trading #market #money #work #stocks #riskmanagement #forex
3202 2018-02-01 00:40:37 That’s normal most stocks fall after. bought deal. If you’ve never traded options before it can be risky to invest heavily
3203 2018-02-01 00:39:48 Simply trade the trade January-March 99% of penny stocks in the key sectors will run so quite acting like your shit smells better than the rest of ours! lol just make your money & stop with your nonsense buddy!
$SRMX holding above .005 after .001-.014+ run $PDXP is doing well too
3204 2018-02-01 00:38:43 "When yields on long-term government bonds exceed the dividend yields of the S&P 500 by 6% or more. sell stocks and buy bonds." Peter Lynch. 
So call me when 10 yr goes over 7%...
3205 2018-02-01 00:38:01 SENATOR GRADUALLY OFFLOAD STOCKS BY THOSE WHO CONTROL MARKETS THATS WHY YOU SEE HIGH NEGATIVE ;AND LOW POSITIVE GAIN THIS PROCESS WILL TAKE ABOUT 4 TO SIX MONTHS IT WILL WIPE OUT ALL GAINS FROM ONE YEAR ONLY MOVE THEY HAVE CHECK MATE!
3206 2018-02-01 00:37:57 Don’t short stocks. Never use leverage. Deploy permanent capital you don’t need for many years. You'll definitely get rich and also stay rich.
3207 2018-02-01 00:37:31 You probably might want to keep these, but I am actually wanting one of your stocks.
3208 2018-02-01 00:36:35 They haven’t because of state line issue which we’ve been fighting but within states, yes weren’t competing because had all colluded w/Obama’s admin on writing Ocare & mandating so it was limited pool. Why do u think healthcare cos stocks soared and premiums went up. Follow $s
3209 2018-02-01 00:35:45 Stocks can make you wait for many years and give many years return even in a single year.
3210 2018-02-01 00:34:02 SENATOR I HAVE FIGURED OUT THE STRATEGY OF WALL STREET ;THEY HAVE GAINED 7 TRILLION DOLLARS IN ONE YEAR; FOR SURE THEY DON'T WANT TO PAY THAT MUCH IN DIVIDENDS ;ONLY LOGIC !BECAUSE THERE IS NO WAR !IS TO GRADUALY OFF LOAD STOCKS OWNED BY THOSE WHO CONTROL+++
3211 2018-02-01 00:33:51 Note to self. Don’t trade drunk stocks.... unless you’re on tequila
3212 2018-02-01 00:33:07 Watch for the golf ball stocks to take a hit.
3213 2018-02-01 00:32:28 Aban stocks are drastically going down.
Are the aban stocks long term or short term
3214 2018-02-01 00:32:28 past 3 days not great

Mon - gap down. had puts, but sold them too early, bc drops haven't lasted. stopped out of many longs, not much damage

Tues - stopped out of more. weird issue with buying power, couldn't buy good stocks for rallies into today's gap up

- continued -
3215 2018-02-01 00:32:14 yes, but i am still waiting for the confirmation of  the availability of the stocks
3216 2018-02-01 00:30:26 ... And we're back. Guess 1 or 2 more dip? I've seen 5 digit reds in my stocks so I don't give a FUD. $eth and $xlm took this dip like a champ. 

#cryptocurrency #btc #eth #ltc #XLM
3217 2018-02-01 00:28:44 @merck how many more #cdc #usa officials have stocks with you??? - @potus #vaxxed #gardasil
3218 2018-02-01 00:27:41 Food And airline Stocks Long Way.
3219 2018-02-01 00:27:35 Scottrade has a list of all stocks/ETFs subject to higher maintenance requirements. But unless you have an acct w/them-prob no help.
3220 2018-02-01 00:27:01 I can’t decide what’s better... being all in on stocks and heavily overweighting a specific theme or that the article closes sharing that he provides advice for a tail risk hedge fund
3221 2018-02-01 00:26:50 If Pharma was worried about profits alone, they’d want VPDs to spread so they can be hospitalized and sell more opioids and such. Since most drug companies are publicly traded, stock value is their main concern, and nothing drives stocks as patenting good medicine
3222 2018-02-01 00:26:25 Yes

See marketsmith services removing all stocks from portfolio.....
3223 2018-02-01 00:26:25 You either die young or live long enough to find yourself using the stocks app on your iPhone

3226 2018-02-01 00:24:17 Made $1,000 today. Got to know how to play the game #stocks
3227 2018-02-01 00:24:14 Yeah people forced to live paycheck to paycheck can afford to buy stocks.
3228 2018-02-01 00:23:22 My Mum stocks up on Greek yoghurt like say its a necessity
3229 2018-02-01 00:22:47 Meanwhile bump stocks are legal and you can buy them right now from the comfort of your home.
3230 2018-02-01 00:22:19 2, if your bag is big enough, take some out and start putting money into different investments (stocks, ETFs, real estate). If you can make it so you can live off your safer investments, then crypto just becomes wealth and fun.
3231 2018-02-01 00:20:49 Why would yesasia put something to sell only to discover they don’t have stocks of it anymore and have to give you a refund? I hate this kind of management...
3232 2018-02-01 00:20:38 Aren’t you the guy that said our stocks would totally tank if President Trump was in office?
3233 2018-02-01 00:20:13 you mean in protecting fish stocks? Or is it the quotas which they were given the same as every other country but then sold on to other fishermen from other EU countries and then retiring?
3234 2018-02-01 00:19:15 He needs a VOICE COACH.
He needs a MESSAGE.

How are people going to earn higher wages? How to help those drowning in debt bc student loans?
What about HEALTH INSURANCE COSTS.
What about people without stocks and 401k and no savings? 

What is THE PLAN?
3235 2018-02-01 00:18:46 My IPR Algorithm 
Intraday Pattern Recognition Algorithm detects statistically predictive patterns in stocks, options and ETFs.
3236 2018-02-01 00:18:46 Nice call on $AB1 H

I followed you in.

Revenues are mind-boggling for a Company this small

& that's just from 1 of their games

Crazy D Heroes game will make them more money in a year than most Tech stocks made added together over the last few years. lol (incl ~$1B MC $1PG) 
3237 2018-02-01 00:18:23 They indicated they would do this before the vote!  Happy for the bump in my stocks, sad for those who don't have stocks and won't really benefit!
3238 2018-02-01 00:18:12 @NipseyHussle is fr one of the greatest role models of our time. Ain’t no other rapper fr tellin young men invest in real things like property’s havin equities stocks and bonds. And I got something to look forward to on my birthday #victoylap feb 16. Thank you for the game nip 
3239 2018-02-01 00:17:00 Just followed by a stocks investment account. I work shifts at an airport newsagents and a friend's books because that doesn't pay enough to support myself as a minister. Know your audience guys.
3240 2018-02-01 00:15:04 Motherfucker I get like 1 commission every 4 months. I put all this fucking time into honing a trade that I can never work in and couldn’t even put bread on the table and I’m constantly bitter about it. Study stocks
3241 2018-02-01 00:13:03 We kicked the CDC director out for buying tobacco stocks. Can we kick the EPA director out if they bought oil or mining stocks?
3242 2018-02-01 00:12:59 This is a cash out and move on deal.  Like when the CEO knows the company’s going to go bankrupt and sells all his stocks in company
3243 2018-02-01 00:12:32 He just hired Azar with tons of stocks, he will “definitely help to bring the prices down”!
3244 2018-02-01 00:12:03 I’m open to anything that trends, but NG is really a short term traders game IMO. Prefer stocks.
3245 2018-02-01 00:10:51 Anytime po pwede magorder as long as may stocks pa. Then waiting time once paid is 20 to 30 days^^
3246 2018-02-01 00:09:40 Hence Stocks in the Dividend Aristocrats Index merits consideration.
3247 2018-02-01 00:09:14 Was last Vegas a tragedty get rid of bum stocks like you promised.
3248 2018-02-01 00:08:49 I don’t know why you gotta tell all the classes that AMD in stocks is good to invest in right now, just trying to ruin our rank smh
3249 2018-02-01 00:06:46 Market snapback from nowhere. Ni if too trust it but some similar stocks making new yearly highs $ALL $BLD $FLT $KGN $TWE
3250 2018-02-01 00:06:38 Respect is key. Most of my TL is trading in venture / CSE stocks, those obviously have lots of weak points. Pretending they don’t doesn’t help. It’s the ability for them to overcome that is what we look for.

Opportunity- Game plan- Challenge - Etc
3251 2018-02-01 00:06:38 Asia stocks begin higher after the positive lead from US, as earnings remains in focus and where the S&P 500 and DJIA posted its best monthly performance since 2016
3252 2018-02-01 00:02:37 So sad that this is what you anti trump people have to resort to make you happy!  what makes us Americans happy is the booming economy, stocks up, among many other great achievements by Mr. Trump!!!!!!! We won Hilary lost SUCK it up already!!!!
3253 2018-02-01 00:02:00 Watching a presentation about corn/cattle/and hog stocks at work.
