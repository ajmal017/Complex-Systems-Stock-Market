1 2018-02-23 23:59:49 I enjoy bergamot oil in general.
2 2018-02-23 23:59:47 The 5% gullible in last week who believed staying was less risky despite wanting Scotland to be indy. Sure if you polled do you want Scotland to be indy running its own economy with all the new oil finds or are you happy bring run by Tories from WM it would be close.
3 2018-02-23 23:59:41 But isn’t butter much better than olive oil? @bulletproofexec @bigfatsurprise
4 2018-02-23 23:59:37 Ah, the heady scent of Vicks Vapo Rub and olbas oil. Smells like being able to breathe for the first time in a while.
5 2018-02-23 23:59:33 I like your idea 2 pay Equalization wi #oil.Next payment 48 hrs AFTER @EnergyEast opens! Dont want oil? Put it in the river with the sewage!
6 2018-02-23 23:59:28 Why cant i just take a dietary supplement with some nicotine entrenched in a healthy oil that could potentially reduce minor inflammation at the same time?  When you don't get the immediate satisfaction and it has to go through the liver the addiction level drop BIG TIME.
7 2018-02-23 23:59:24 Girl u fine u better oil it up and embrace it

@twt_kecantikann @MaisarahMahmud @ImanAbdulRahim #tanyaTK
10 2018-02-23 23:59:18 But what are your opinions specifically? I think Alberta can increase oil and gas production but decrease CO2 emissions associated with extraction and refinement by using raw geothermal heat, biomass, and biogas. What do you, personally, think should be done?
11 2018-02-23 23:59:08 im breaking out really badly does anyone ((who has bad hormonal/cystic acne)) know anything to help lemme know besides tree tree oil and water smdjz
12 2018-02-23 23:59:08 Yes. I have to check the oil and change the blades on the mowers to make sure they’re ready for next week anyways
13 2018-02-23 23:59:00 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other
14 2018-02-23 23:58:58 Riiiight....cause @potus policies lower oil prices which hurts RUS while HC would’ve driven Prices higher which HELPS RUS.

40 2018-02-23 23:57:20 Is the left calling for the boycott of the auto manufacturer? Tire manufacturer or whoever changed her oil last?
41 2018-02-23 23:56:51 Probably exclusive rights to invest into oil and gas in Syria signed by dictator Assad is worth killing most Syrian civilians and destroy the country
42 2018-02-23 23:55:56 Baby oil is Magic
43 2018-02-23 23:55:48 Hockey is definitely the one sport with integrity and for everyone. For me it's more than a game it's vitality and life.
44 2018-02-23 23:55:46 it's called play and stay by eco style .. they have all different types but i got coconut oil
45 2018-02-23 23:55:43 Nominate an oil and coal guy ... for energy secretary  stupid
46 2018-02-23 23:55:27 I'm guessing the view is a little different from the ivory tower. #POTUS Australian #coal #LNP (Libs.)and #GOP #Oil. #auspol @SkyNewsAuspol @ABC @abcnews @InsidersABC @SBS @SBSNews @SkyNewsAust.
47 2018-02-23 23:55:12 Chevron's attempts at presenting themselves as "good corporate neighbors" is laughable in its self-serving absurdity. If Chevron cared at all about the young people in this ad, the company would cease oil production and, instead, support the transition to green energy.
48 2018-02-23 23:55:07 Using an oil has actually helped!!!
49 2018-02-23 23:54:44 Clove oil is my best friend right now

52 2018-02-23 23:54:22 Those oil fields you mention, Wagner PMC tried to take them over to enrich themselves, all the revenue goes to Russia Syrians get nothing.
53 2018-02-23 23:53:30 @jockowillink @echocharles I’m trying to buy some Super Krill Oil to support the podcast but also to support my joints... is there a promo code I can use ?
54 2018-02-23 23:52:43 Pipeline leaks do happen and so do tanker spills. Pretty sure people living on the coast do not want a  repeat of #ExxonValdez oil spill which is still affecting the coast of Alaska. #bcpoli #abpoi #cdnpoli #AlbertaWhine #BanBitumen

62 2018-02-23 23:52:13 Really. Instead of oil. It’s a low fat recipe even with the chocolate chips. You don’t taste the yogurt at all and the chocolate chips stay meaty!
63 2018-02-23 23:51:54 When you ride with Caleb you gotta throw money for gas an oil 
64 2018-02-23 23:51:51 sounds perfect, let's curb plastic and therefore oil consumption

69 2018-02-23 23:51:15 I have a really good tip when trying to angle a certain model, and I've been using it on Campfire Chaos' Oil Barrels.
Union it (if applicable), click and hold (as in moving it), and release. It automatically sets the angle the model is inclined on.
70 2018-02-23 23:51:09 Hate sleeping with coconut oil in my hair but it’s worth it when I wash it out
71 2018-02-23 23:51:05 Why some of yall fake eye lashes be looking like oil spills across yall eyes?

78 2018-02-23 23:50:16 He is right though, Scotland's oil n gas will still be in huge demand and very marketable after Brexit. But, only for the gain of a warmonger Wastemonster.
The man is right, Scotland ownership is of huge value after Brexit
He is a puppet in the game, cheater, liar, loaded dice
79 2018-02-23 23:49:55 Okay oil change companies that are on the Twitter. I need an oil change. Who's got the best deal for me?

83 2018-02-23 23:49:09 OLIVES & OLIVE OIL
Virtually every family has at least some trees. Most villages have an olive pressing factory.
84 2018-02-23 23:49:02 Baby oil to make 'em shiny, slippery and sexy!
85 2018-02-23 23:49:01 Not sure this is factual!
They also had said that oil would run out by 2030 about 25 Years ago!
86 2018-02-23 23:49:00 No. The most powerful countries in the world are Christian countries. These Christian countries routinely bomb Muslim-majority countries into oblivion, installing hard-line Islamic leaders who are sympathetic to the West's needs (oil).
87 2018-02-23 23:48:43 Brought my rain gear. Aka, my Florida shorts 
88 2018-02-23 23:48:36 oil the nibs
89 2018-02-23 23:48:34 Great question! Reach out to @billmckibben and the @350 team to talk to them about their experiences leading the fossil fuel divestment movement. And the @CeresNews team has years and years of experience regarding shareholder engagement on the risks of oil.
90 2018-02-23 23:48:21 Many companies have already, but tweet these companies that still have relationships with the #NRA and demand that they sever ties. Come on people - the squeeky wheel gets the oil. #NRABloodOnYourHands

94 2018-02-23 23:47:44 Having elaborate expression doesn't mean a man cannot support the wrongs in this World. Of course it's all depending on Eastern oil and you know it
95 2018-02-23 23:47:29 CBD oil will bring you down.
96 2018-02-23 23:47:17 Stop as railroad cars go by.  On the side of many are corn syrup.  On the sides of others are corn oil (and other seed oils).  Straight from the refinery to your dinner table.  People need to stop and think.
97 2018-02-23 23:47:05 For Albertans, it does not matter who brings the pipeline as long as it happens...BTW there was a Rally by unemployed oil and gas worker, engineers and designers today at 3pm in tge downtown calgary in support of pipeline..these are the real AB ppl suffering for years
98 2018-02-23 23:46:58 ‘It’s what she did with the oil bloc’ yen yen yen.
Tell us, what did she do with it exactly apart from sit back and receive money?
99 2018-02-23 23:46:53 Ah, yeah works a treat for that. Stick a couple in a bowl of boiling water with garlic ginger & olbas oil and put a towel on your head, it's what my mum always made me do
100 2018-02-23 23:46:43 It's oil, it's wheat, it's soil, it's meat, it's beef!
101 2018-02-23 23:46:41 Funny how Turkey was quite happy to help Syrian "rebels" who were murdering their own people, even buy their stolen oil!  but is more than happy to bomb Kurdish rebels protesting Turkish oppression!! What happened to SOVEREIGNTY??
102 2018-02-23 23:46:23 They are here for construction labour work, all over Vancouver driving oil patch 4x4’s or living in campers.....when the oil gravy train restarts they will run back
103 2018-02-23 23:46:03 Colin Hay is the lead singer of Men At Work. Peter Garret lead singer of Midnight Oil & studied law & member of parliament- fierce activist & protector of human rights
104 2018-02-23 23:45:40 Yes, a 100% coconut oil soap will be able to be colored similarly to any other cold process bar recipe.
105 2018-02-23 23:45:38 Hopefully the rain holds off.

108 2018-02-23 23:44:57 I think the way triscuts are made means they won’t take on oil in the same way other (even processed) startches. What was the effect, oily Brillo pad?
109 2018-02-23 23:44:38 coconut oil starting to pay off
110 2018-02-23 23:44:31 I drink almost 2 liters of water & use jojoba oil for my hair and face. works for me plus I work out which I would think helps too!
111 2018-02-23 23:44:29 If we become so it will be because Big Oil intertwined with related Global policies on Energy and Military Industrial and does us in. Don't forget, the vaunted Robert Gates & Condoleezza Rice pushed Tillerson into now gutted Sec of State. No accident.
112 2018-02-23 23:44:26 Where is the duck fat and truffle oil I ordered...?
113 2018-02-23 23:44:22 Y'know what the best kind of chocolate is? Chocolate that doesn't contain palm oil.

115 2018-02-23 23:44:14 The pathetic thing is, you brought up #LGBTQ rights which has nothing to do with pipelines or tar sands oil. All i have heard from you is excuses why we should rely so heavily on tar sands anymore. You have latterly no real debate here. #bcpoli 3abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM
116 2018-02-23 23:43:49 Read this tweet whilst getting my cars oil changed... wondering if I battle my eye's at the manager, I could get a discount?
Most likely just a black eye
117 2018-02-23 23:43:46 This novel has me researching, among other things, the Venezuelan oil industry, autonomous vehicles, auxiliaries in the Roman Imperial army, and Rehoboth Beach. Day 24 of consecutive work — cooking right along.

118 2018-02-23 23:43:43 1.5 hours is far too long to wait for an oil change when you had an appt. Is that normal? @Hyundai
119 2018-02-23 23:43:40 I'm offended, @dmj_sally said "if I walked in to a coach store and saw you working there I'd feel like I walked in to get an oil change for my car" lmao like does the beard make people feel this way? 
120 2018-02-23 23:43:33 Considering getting a new set of hair clippers in the future, but for now...I need to find the damn oil for my current ones.

126 2018-02-23 23:42:56 The dumbest thing I ever bought was an oil painting. I (knowingly) paid a guy with questionable painting skills to paint me a version of that Jesus riding a brontosaurus picture they have in the creation museum. That's not the dumb part though.
127 2018-02-23 23:42:36 Yang basic banget: milk/oil cleanser, facial wash, toner, moisturizer, sunscreen. Acne spot treatment juga perlu sih menurutku, just in case aja sebagai life saver kalo tiba-tiba muncul jerawat hehe.
128 2018-02-23 23:42:31 This sort of “race baiting propaganda” in the “deregulated” (ahem) Free Press is actually an admission that COLLUSION between the GOP and its many conspirators (Oil & Gas, Defense Contractors, NRA, Religious Right, et al.) has INJURED this Democratic IDEAL in the U.S.
129 2018-02-23 23:42:23 I didn’t work today, got my oil changed, did a load of dishes and laundry, everybody is in a great mood UGH I love Friday’s <3

131 2018-02-23 23:41:51 Seawater never works for osmosis energy storage, I use saturated salt solution; hydro turbine never works, I use hydraulic oil motor. Membrane power density 2.5KW/m2! Solar evaporation salt panel harvestable power: 3 W/m2 at 24 hrs average < 20 W/m2 of PV panel, but dirty cheap!

133 2018-02-23 23:41:37 Low setting for 8 hours. Salt all sides of meat well before it goes in. No added liquid. Just meat with salt. Pull out when done and shred with 2 forks, discarding excess fat. Add favorite sauce or just yellow mustard and olive oil. Enjoy.
134 2018-02-23 23:41:26 wassup, i got weed and oil too
135 2018-02-23 23:41:05 I am certain iraq will spend many years paying back the West in oil--maybe not if the Iranians exert their considerable influence.
136 2018-02-23 23:41:00 Resist taking hot showers and long soaks, both of which remove your skin's natural oil barrier, causing it to dry out more easily, suggests the American Academy of Dermatology. The water temperature should be between the high 90s and 100 degrees, no higher. #winter

139 2018-02-23 23:40:37 she's also on the Fraser Institute's board, they peddle oil & privatization of things like healthcare. Her campaign is being run by former racist Rebel media guy Hamish Marshall.  So much for a "fresh perspective" #onpoli #PCPOLdr

150 2018-02-23 23:38:48 I doubt that. Oil is already right at $65, why would they wait until Easter?  Maybe if it’s $85 by Easter, which isn’t that farfetched.
151 2018-02-23 23:38:43 Put argan oil on them. Helps a lot with that.

165 2018-02-23 23:36:57 To be clear, I'm not saying climate advocates want to see people harmed. But that the (now antiquated) notion of peak oil supply forces an earnest discussion on alternatives -- as someone joked in response to your earlier tweet.

167 2018-02-23 23:36:36 Thanks so much Tom - that chart is really interesting - if I am reading it right, it appears that oil prices are on a very slippery slope here. What is really interesting is that the volume of the big money shorts is approx 50% more now than at the peak in oil prices in 2014.

172 2018-02-23 23:35:46 What manner of change is WA advocating?
173 2018-02-23 23:35:39 We can’t even get SFERS to divest from oil companies
174 2018-02-23 23:35:38 Ooh, I could put a bit of hurt on that kilo. In my case, I go with a bit of olive oil and herbs over it, with some crudité veggies (carrots, artichoke hearts, peppers) and crusty bread.
175 2018-02-23 23:35:24 If all you do is add a quart of oil to your car’s engine but ONLY after driving it for 3  to 4 months AFTER the light went on, I respect you 

Because I used to be YOU
176 2018-02-23 23:35:18 I was victim ti this also RT @K_Leinese: When you pull up because the sign says $19.99 oil change & BOOM they tell you $70 because your car takes synthetic oil.

179 2018-02-23 23:34:56 Oil City makes me nervous.
180 2018-02-23 23:34:51 Time should be measured by the amount of olive oil bottles we go through.
181 2018-02-23 23:34:27 The oil wrecked my chest 
182 2018-02-23 23:34:22 So does this mean that OPEC supply cuts is being replaced by a higher demand for US crude oil?
Will this cause wti and brent spreads to widen further?
183 2018-02-23 23:34:12 I didn't feel this one probably the strong winds or aftershock from last Saturday's quake or maybe oil digging this also causes earthquakes.
184 2018-02-23 23:34:03 I do, lol

192 2018-02-23 23:33:10 America wants oil and they get it by destabilizing countries and setting up Radical islamist governments or dictatorships. Its all for money, buddy. Open your eyes. And btw america fought in Afghanistan, iraq, syria etc so idk what u mean

194 2018-02-23 23:32:42 And @bouldercolorado wants to upzone all light industrial and commercial instead of existing neighborhoods. What happens when you need to go to commerce city for an oil change like you currently need to do to dump dirt?
195 2018-02-23 23:32:42 Spilt hot oil on me while listening to #WANTYOUBACK for the first time. 

Pro tip: don't get really happy while cooking with oil
196 2018-02-23 23:32:16 G-d damn 2018. How about an asteroid? We can send a group of oil rig workers to go nuke it? Or some damn aliens? Where’s Will Smith? I’m so over the 15th month of this year!
197 2018-02-23 23:32:10 Unfortunately the Oil sands have become a religion. I hope world pressure will reduce emissions and the advance in solar tech will reduce the production.

201 2018-02-23 23:31:32 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for Thou art with me; Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me.
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

202 2018-02-23 23:31:29 Tough few days after an amazing stretch. Underwater a bit on oil and market shorts. Horribly boring week. Feels like grinding all shorts out

204 2018-02-23 23:31:03 ...OLIVE oil?
205 2018-02-23 23:30:54 First there was agriculture

Followed by manufacturing

Then oil production and refining.

The next economic revolution will be crypto currency and blockchain technology.

Whichever county's embraces it will be a the next super power.
206 2018-02-23 23:30:33 I'd gladly exchange my certificate for a free oil block. Folorunsho Alakija speaking like she built anything from the scratch.

215 2018-02-23 23:29:10 My only goal for this weekend is to see an onion sliced and stacked up filled with oil and lit on fire so as to look like a volcano (bonus points if it gets pushed along to look like a choo choo train)
216 2018-02-23 23:29:07 Yeah @CNN had @DLoesch on this morning,  not to apologize but to bitch about her comment that a lot of the news media loves the ratings mass shootings bring.  Just talked over her the entire time
217 2018-02-23 23:29:05 He’ll need some gun oil for that burn.
218 2018-02-23 23:28:42 @cityofcalgary Living in a city that should have recognized that it needed to change and diversify its focus as far as resources in the 80s and is too gas and oil focus, and not minding to pollute while forgetting about those in wheelchairs with no cars is a mental nightmare.
219 2018-02-23 23:28:37 Government failed here on all levels. End of story. The idea we as individuals should solely rely on Gov for protection is absurd

221 2018-02-23 23:28:01 Drivel. There is no credible economic study showing a net benefit from Brexit. Stop selling snake oil.
222 2018-02-23 23:28:00 Oil has nothing to do with #LGBTQ or dictators. #Norway has become one on the richest countries in the world, and the money saved by it's government has created excellent living conditions for Norwegians. pity #Alberta can't see that. #bcpoli 3abpoli #cdnpoli #AlbertaWhine

224 2018-02-23 23:27:54 It’s honestly sick that a woman in tj maxx just asked me if we have the oil diffusers and I was able to tell her exactly where to find them in the store. I do not work here nor do I own an oil diffuser.
225 2018-02-23 23:27:46 I feel like I'm a disappointment to my oil change guy
226 2018-02-23 23:27:44 Don't the indictments of Gates and Manafort prove collusion? What's the threshold? Trump and Putin oil wrestling in the nude?
227 2018-02-23 23:27:41 I got in at .39 out .51 few weeks back. Been out of internet for a while see it's back in .3s. Back to Canada next week. Looking to load up.. Seems a lot of deals out there..CDN oil and gas stocks are either headed for bankruptcy or extremely cheap right now

230 2018-02-23 23:27:09 Actually sounds like a good Wes Anderson script. A woke oil baron experiences an existential crisis and tries to convince himself he's not human garbage

232 2018-02-23 23:26:48 There must be oil involved ... everything leads to oil deals and sanctions

244 2018-02-23 23:25:02 Silly. Oil demand is growing every year. You are off shoring your emission and risk of spill. You don’t care about spills in Nigeria, which happen daily. Canada has most enviro friendly Oil.
245 2018-02-23 23:24:53 After a month of working up my business and constantly being on my feet, I definitely feel a Goddess day coming up on my next real day off next week. I'm going to slather myself in oil and go to the nail salon or something...give me ideas please!!
246 2018-02-23 23:23:59 The oil companies are getting more creative with their bullshit. I admire that.

277 2018-02-23 23:17:58 ！？(‘＊‘)
278 2018-02-23 23:17:40 ふんすふんすっ！！
279 2018-02-23 23:17:24 I looked into it. Saw castor oil, coconut oil. Trial & results I suppose then stick w/what works best. My hair is good to go but I started biotin to maintain healthy hair. Now I’m sprouty AFnot helped the brows though.
280 2018-02-23 23:17:21 Uninteresting fact, I used to 'Pump Gas' or serve customers at my grandparents filling station when I was a kid. Every weekend or school holiday my brother and I would fill cars with fuel, check oil, water and washer fluid. Great days.
281 2018-02-23 23:17:16 Was supposed to go get my oil changed but now I’m in bed eating cereal and drinking wine
282 2018-02-23 23:17:12 We're in Costa Rica now with limited internet access. I checked in today and none of my CDN oil stocks bids have filled!! Enjoy your vacay!!
283 2018-02-23 23:17:09 doing hot oil treatments do wonders to my hair
284 2018-02-23 23:17:05 Don't blame Brooklyn. Blame the culinary school that charged big money for promises of future celebrity chefdom, only to send them into a industry with low wages and huge egos patronized by idiots who will buy anything drizzled with God damn truffle oil. This is a cry for help.
285 2018-02-23 23:16:59 Video games that promote shooting people! It desensitizes . People become targets.

291 2018-02-23 23:16:24 Hot oil treatment got my hair soft as a mf
292 2018-02-23 23:16:19 @chucktodd is interviewing snake oil salesmen @JohnKasich, giving him a pass on his A rating with the NRA and asking if he’s going to run for President again, an obsession and wish ONLY the media has.  #MSNBC
293 2018-02-23 23:16:12 Don’t need an oil change... Euge took my car allowance and gave me a bus pass.
294 2018-02-23 23:16:11 @CREDorg IS THE LYING DECEITFUL MOUTHPIECE FOR COLORADO OIL & GAS INDUSTRY  SAYING IT IS MODEL FOR COUNTRY! Ya! For sure! Homes exploding! Well sites exploding. Residents & workers killed! Students kept out of school. Yep! MODEL OF SAFETY FOR COUNTRY! 3RD WORLD COUNTRY MAYBE!!!

300 2018-02-23 23:15:22 Who wants to take my car to get an oil change?? No one, mmk 
301 2018-02-23 23:15:20 Not at all, no.

The US-Russia level of that conflict is entirely about oil & geopolitics.
302 2018-02-23 23:14:57 Mini sweet peppers sliced and sautéed in sesame oil, fried shiitake mushrooms (I coated them in almond milk and then in corn starch and fried in coconut oil), avocado, little sriracha, and I topped it with panko and dipped in soy sauce! They’re so fucking good
303 2018-02-23 23:14:32 Trump is literally the GOP base. He buys all of the snake oil. He even believed all that bullshit from Fox News et. al about there being a plan in place to replace Obamacare.
304 2018-02-23 23:14:29 I thought I was done when expensive oil changes when I sold my powerstroke but I just paid $100 for an oil change for the Mustang 
305 2018-02-23 23:14:08 Hard to say. Also you guys should be better about labeling what products use peanut oil I had an allergic reaction last time I ate your fried rice.
306 2018-02-23 23:13:54 Cold cut trio on white. Everything but onions. Extra salt & pepper & extra oil & vinegar. Add salami. What.
307 2018-02-23 23:13:54 Okay, oil sands. 12 more years till we reach 50% renewables in Saskatchewan is a start. Where are the projects being developed?
308 2018-02-23 23:13:32 And all the rest.. Coal, oil, mining etc.. Crazy backbenchers..! But yes.. They certainly toe the line of the processed food industry as well..
309 2018-02-23 23:13:27 || its ok bby I’ve been there. But if you can put like some coconut oil in it until then or anything for sure do it. I don’t even leave the salon with my hair dried I’m like just put the conditioner in and leave it I’ll wash it out later

Being blonde is sooooo rough on hair

314 2018-02-23 23:12:53 I understand that! I’ve always done my own oil changes in the past so maybe that’s why it seems so expensive
315 2018-02-23 23:12:53 Mar... who? I only know Canola oil
316 2018-02-23 23:12:24 I never said I or anyone doesn’t use oil, I just don’t think we need to keep investing in it. Like repairing a 10 year old car. Move on.
317 2018-02-23 23:12:19 This man is a snake oil salesman and you gave him the floor. Shame on him. I'd say shame on @CNN but that is futile.
318 2018-02-23 23:12:12 Lol ,a comrade sees things differently, it only takes a comrade to understand the way a comrade analyze situations.
A comrade is never intimidated at d face of impunity.
319 2018-02-23 23:12:02 Cod fillets coated in panko crumbs, fried in coconut oil! So good served with your mustard sauce!!
320 2018-02-23 23:11:53 No consolation but decades ago ours failed on 1st January (oil fired). As gas was coming in Spring we spent a very cold winter with a huge electricity bill until new gas boiler fitted :-(
Hope a new boiler isn't to dear.

326 2018-02-23 23:10:34 Trump, you have the oil. But more importantly, he choked. Art of the fraud.
327 2018-02-23 23:10:34 I don’t doubt that if Bettman said to Jeremy Jacobs and Ed Snider we can make more in Houston or Seattle or wherever, they would have said “let’s do it”. So I really think Bettman had a role. I don’t like the guy mostly, but I cannot deny his part in the Oil franchise.

330 2018-02-23 23:10:25 Important trend, but also should note that Chinese customs data does not include crude oil exports to North Korea.
331 2018-02-23 23:10:24 That would be the moment I exit my oil stocks.

333 2018-02-23 23:10:21 @RepRohrabacher You better oil up your asshole boy, you're heading for the big house.
334 2018-02-23 23:10:20 ALL broadcast media does this on every issue. It’s a problem with the medium. This is why they don’t cover weekly environmental disasters but endlessly talked about the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. I don’t like it, but that’s the truth. You just can’t see this through your bias.
335 2018-02-23 23:10:11 Got a haircut today from my regular barber the last 2 years,he was so happy to see me back in Indy I had to sit there and pretend for about an hour that pre-season has been going great,new coach better than Pep, Lucas oil stadium fantastic..it was either that or explain 12B #FML
336 2018-02-23 23:10:11 Begin your week with the beautiful Melissa oil. As one of our rarest and most expensive oils, Melissa has a wide range of health benefits and uses. Because of its positive effect on mood, Melissa has long been used to calm feelings of tension and nervousness.
337 2018-02-23 23:10:09 Founding Fathers never asked for Oil Portrait ID & only used paper ballots for voting and counting the vote which automatically provided recount ability.  It's not a bad system.

Then home and changed the oil in the Pilot. Still on antibiotics and things not yet tasting right, so may have to wait on those treats though
348 2018-02-23 23:09:10 Good point, Amy. Have they ever said she was 17 and that he was in a power position of trust over her? Why does that church defend him as if he will get the death penalty? Work another job and never be in the public trust again. Oil rigs are hiring I've heard.
349 2018-02-23 23:09:07 $104 for a oil change and windshield wipers.... I ain’t coming back here 
350 2018-02-23 23:09:03 Trump has an international criminal enterprise partnership with putin, there isn't any blackmail, 45 is a VERY willing partner. NK didn't offer trump an oil company partnership or many loans. Maybe didn't realize how cheap USA was to buy!

Even now with them wanting to fix the heath care system but not pay their OWN employees Amazon is a cash cow, nothing else. That billion dollar entity might as well just be GOP money. Look at them as oil tycoon light.
353 2018-02-23 23:08:42 Norway exports oil at a world price.  Canada should follow Norway, export all of our Gay friendly energy molecules and attain a world price. That way we can afford free health care and provide drinking water on reserves.

359 2018-02-23 23:07:39 Tried to have a fondue meal with company one time, but the cold air bearing down on the pot kept the oil too cool to cook the meat! Novice newlyweds then, it was so embarrassing! 
360 2018-02-23 23:07:32 I got tired of the taste of oil n fat

365 2018-02-23 23:07:00 Yeah...loved how they cracked down on Russia supplying them with oil....such a bigly example of leadership.

367 2018-02-23 23:06:41 1)  Sorry, but that is not even close to true.  I can buy binary explosive at the local hardware store, w/o ID.  They also sell guns.  That takes a Fed background check, and three days.

That's if you want to buy ready-made, and not just get fertilizer and fuel oil.  Or ...

371 2018-02-23 23:05:36 Husband was in the oil industry. The uncertainty of his job being there each hitch was too much. We needed stability.
372 2018-02-23 23:05:27 @McClellanOsc Hi Tom - in your daily edition report, do you cover potential trends in Oil frequently as well?
373 2018-02-23 23:05:18 I’m living that life where I get to have a full tank of gas whenever I want and I get to have my oil changed when needed. I used to dream of this life #blessed
374 2018-02-23 23:05:12 "it's ok if we drill for all the oil mother nature will replenish it in time"
you know oil comes from huge deposits of like..."dead organic material" and bone. right. 

like ...from a mass extinction.

so...maybe don't be so excited about it magically replenishing anytime soon
375 2018-02-23 23:04:50 I’ve been burning the midnight oil by watching films. 

God, I have watched more than five films for night. I need to go to sleep, but there is a few films that I want to watch. Okay then, I will sleep in holidays, I hope)9

378 2018-02-23 23:04:07 TX has oil, we have US funded activists land locking energy below the world price so the US can get it dirt cheap and sell it back to us at a high price. Canadians are too stupid to understand that they are subsiding the US.
379 2018-02-23 23:04:03 Bro everyone in the Muslim world hates this spoiled Arabs I can't wait till their oil runs out..
380 2018-02-23 23:03:48 Probably Eric Holder/obama.  Not You. lol. sorry, MAGA!
381 2018-02-23 23:03:40 If we had actually started running out of oil in the early 2000s the environmental outcomes would've probably not been very good. The viable alternatives at that point were in some ways worse than what it would've been replacing.
382 2018-02-23 23:03:38 @Mightytauren Here's to three years of not killing each other, three years of late nights, three years of love, curled up in bed with Bella near and goodnight backrubs and painting on bruised knees together, getting lung oil all over my face and poking yours. I love you.
383 2018-02-23 23:03:21 With what money? Thin air money? Only real option now is oil money or shady money.
384 2018-02-23 23:03:16 Get out of other countries for there resources and oil and amazingly we will have Billions and Billions of funds.
385 2018-02-23 23:03:11 é o seguinte gastei mts $$ com bio oil p tirar essas cicatrizes da minha perna acho bom esta merda funcionar
386 2018-02-23 23:03:10 That Turnbull is inspired by a snake oil merchant's snake oil is hardly surprising.
387 2018-02-23 23:02:58 The economy was rebounding under obama but not making the huge strides that it did under trump.  I credit the cutting of regulations and opening up for drilling for oil etc.  I feel when the tax cuts kick in then watch out.

394 2018-02-23 23:02:05 I place a few drops of Cedarwood oil on my temples and hold hematite while focusing on the weight of the stone, and my connection to the ground beneath me. My meditations are timed so that I can focus, if ever I find myself off track I focus on my breathing.
395 2018-02-23 23:02:04 Used to think "there isn't anything you can do about stretchmarks outside of time or surgery", but I've been using this skin therapy oil for 6 weeks now and I gotta say I can really see a difference.

It also makes me smell like chocolate, so 10/10

404 2018-02-23 23:00:40 Yelp review of my plumber: He asked how much I was paying for rent then laughed when I told him. Also told me I should stop eating so much oil because it's clogging my drain. 5 stars for honesty.
405 2018-02-23 23:00:38 Well, perhaps not the Mad Max bit! But the idea that there is literally no more oil would arguably accelerate the transition.

410 2018-02-23 22:59:37 Before being arrested in a terrorist deal involving oil and heroin for guns and training, arms smuggler Diaa Mohsen was paid at least $5,000 by one of Dr. el Amir’s companies, his HMO was suspected by law enforcement of being used to funnel money directly to Osama bin laden.
411 2018-02-23 22:59:32 Oh my goodness @sunflowerxvibes, I just saw your post on the coconut oil page and that’s horrible. I seriously hope that you’re ok and that you’re going to be ok. You’ll be in my thoughts & prayers. Stay strong!

426 2018-02-23 22:57:51 That's about as much of the study I remember reading. Definitely do some research on the nutrients and minerals that come with a supplement so you can chose whats best for you. Biotin is always a key nutrient for hair growth, vitamin A for sebum (natural oil) production, etc.

429 2018-02-23 22:57:04 I think the big issue is America and it’s fracking oil. Until runs out Scotland is buggered

431 2018-02-23 22:56:48 Y'all my car is overheating by so much. I'm a bit overdue for an oil change but... Is low oil why a car overheats? Concerned I will be sans car soon.

436 2018-02-23 22:55:52 Not to brag, but I’m pretty impressed with myself. I can change the oil in both of our cars and don’t even put them on my jack.
437 2018-02-23 22:55:35 I would retweet nearly any other, but Symantec is selling snake oil. Sorry.
438 2018-02-23 22:55:30 Wasn’t drilling for oil and ruining the environment in a chapter in the Bible? Something like: and God said “drill baby drill thar’s gold in them there hills gold liquid gold” can’t remember what chapter or verse but I’m sure it’s in there.
439 2018-02-23 22:55:19 It's "premium oil"
440 2018-02-23 22:54:58 You and your coconut oil  but yes I definitely will have to take your advice and do that! Just gotta make it a routine and stick to it 
441 2018-02-23 22:54:34 There’s a pretty clear choice between drilling and not drilling. There is an estimated 300 days of oil offshore. Fiscally its a stupid idea. Environmentally it’s a disaster.

For whatever reason, you got an oil well.
454 2018-02-23 22:52:51 Moe’s booksellers in Berkeley back in the 60’s smelled like patchouli oil and French Gauloises cigarettes. No thank you very much.
455 2018-02-23 22:52:32 Riding a favourite hobby horse, had the oil sands cos focussed on full synthetic production with a big application of CCS, total growth would have smaller, but emissions would now be much lower & the highway opened to lower carbon generation of fuels, chemicals & electricity FIN

458 2018-02-23 22:52:18 It's not all bad news. The US military have set up bases in the desert in eastern Syria to protect the oil and gas fields, so at least they are safe. If you think the US government fights wars for humanitarian reasons don't look to closely, you might end up disappointed.
459 2018-02-23 22:51:27 That's the crux of 's problems. Even the Soviet Union largely collapsed b/c it was a petrostate & the 80's weren't kind to oil prices. It's unfortunate to see $ going to military tech but not diversification of the econ. The  beat  to 5th gen b/c of better priorities

462 2018-02-23 22:51:18 I wouldn't be surprised if RedBull is the fastest team in 2018. With the FIA tightening up engine regulations to avoid exploits like burning oil as fuel, the Renault engine should be very close to the likes of Mercedes and Ferrari, and RedBull has a great chassis and drivers.
463 2018-02-23 22:50:53 Regime change was instigated by the US and UK because Gaddafi was going to nationalise Libya's oil. Same happened in Iran in 53.

471 2018-02-23 22:49:49 Flash Friday Fragrance Oil Sale- buy one 1 fl oz get one 1/2 off Fragrance oils only, no essential oils. Online orders will be refuned after checking out.
472 2018-02-23 22:49:41 when demand stays constant and supply decreases, price increases. but how long does it take for this to happen? when an oil rig blows up, how long does it take for price to go up? demand and supply curves do not capture the time dimension

479 2018-02-23 22:48:35 So it was a good idea to schedule my oil change for 8am huh?
480 2018-02-23 22:48:28 But when it comes to #nativeAmericans standing up against #BigOil terrorists who poison our water you chose to “Let it play out” ignoring the #WaterProtectors whom I thought you’d have their backs too. The oil pipeline DID burst in several places on several occasions BTW. #noDAPL
481 2018-02-23 22:48:26 And there are 15 variables that depending up how they interact will determine if/how long it floats, if/how long it holds together, if it forms tar balls, if it disperses, etc. And other grades of crude oil have their own issues.
482 2018-02-23 22:48:20 I don't know your ailment but grilled romaine Caesar salad is wonderful. Just cut the romaine in half lengthwise, splash a little oil on it and grill it to your liking.
483 2018-02-23 22:48:10 Or u can rub lavender and chamomile essential oil on the bottom of ur feet :)
484 2018-02-23 22:47:47 I was on biotin for so long. Didnt help me. So my daughters friend told her about that oil. Said she had great results after having her hair in breads, and weaves. Her hair filled in and started gtg fuller and she felt fairly quickly. I just started using on my head and brows
485 2018-02-23 22:47:31 Went to get an oil change and they vacuumed my floors.... I’m psyched.

488 2018-02-23 22:46:57 Instead of waiting on the groundhog to tell me if spring is here I just check and see if my coconut oil is still solid

- Oil change for car
- Read a shit-load of comic books
- Spend the money I saved from breaking up with girlfriend on wine
- Possibly watch a movie or something
- Maybe get ice cream? 
- Idk, cry a lot probably

498 2018-02-23 22:44:07 Drove me nuts last night to say Puljujarvi  has to earn the top minutes. I get there's a trade deadline but he's so wrong. We need to run management and lots of media away from our team!
499 2018-02-23 22:44:01 I’m suffering with really bad dry lips/ sores at the moment. Can anyone recommend anything? I’ve been recommended coconut oil. Just wondering if you can suggest anything else in case that doesn’t work?

503 2018-02-23 22:43:38 - Take the oil.
- Bomb the s*** out of cities under siege.
- Torture detainees.
- Police shouldn't be too nice.
- Opioid addicts shouldn't have started in the first place.
- Arm schoolteachers.

517 2018-02-23 22:40:31 Haven’t heard that one before. I guess the oil barrens hiding money in off shore accounts do nothing to screw up the planet or the millions of deaths caused by wars in the name of oil do nothing to screw up the planet. Climate change is a result of wasteful use of oil period

528 2018-02-23 22:38:46 Attacking inconvenient science is not wise. Omissions impact our climate. As certain as laws of physics. Ignore for oil oligarchs?

In the 60's, oceans were too big to pollute; pollution a fact of life. NE rivers were toxic chemical sewers.  Industry fought, people won.
529 2018-02-23 22:38:35 Get this oil changed and I’m outtttttt
530 2018-02-23 22:38:29 Never taken that. I remember drinking cod liver oil in tablespoons full to get rid of a cold. Nasty as fuck! 
531 2018-02-23 22:38:18 Stream will be delayed tonight. Taking 20 years to change my oil, plus I'm starving. Probably only an hour delay though.
532 2018-02-23 22:38:14 Well... I’m not the tallest person I’ve ever seen 
533 2018-02-23 22:37:55 ...reasons! (oil)

535 2018-02-23 22:37:33 Right, all of world's best scientists, all national academies of science, all reputable science organizations in the world are all liars. Just you and the oil, coal and gas lobbyists are truth-tellers and science wizards that know more than all the climate scientists. So foolish.
536 2018-02-23 22:37:29 I paid $20 for abreeva because I have a cold sore, used it for two days and it got worse.. today I've been using coconut oil on it for the past 2 hours and it has shown instant improvement.. medicne is a scam, choose all natural remedies first! Must cheaper and healthier

538 2018-02-23 22:37:26 Saudí Arabia is the biggest crude oil exporter, ahead of Russia. That's the only date I know for sure. Who knows what else is wrong.

543 2018-02-23 22:36:10 So what is the decent length of time for #Brexit to die down and for everyone (apart from the ERG) to get over it. It’s like turning an oil tanker and we might be approaching the stop. The turn may then take 12 months then we can start slowly in the right direction.

558 2018-02-23 22:34:10 MAC’s Hint of Color Lip Oil is Now Available in the U.S. The M.A.C. Hint of Colour Lip Oil gives lips a pretty popsicle stain effect. It was originally available in Asia, but it's launching in the U.S. in March.
559 2018-02-23 22:34:01 Or they found oil tanks hahaha.
560 2018-02-23 22:33:59 Replace stable with high keep oil prices high.
561 2018-02-23 22:33:59 I doing okay. Running heavy equipment in the evil oil patch of Alberta for now. Looking for stable work that'll keep me home. Work camp life isn't for me. Wait...is this a TC that got out of control for you? .
562 2018-02-23 22:33:51 Not brainwashed Venus, aware. I played & won at sports, served 7 years in the military, worked in direct sales all my life, owned my own Oil & Gas company, Securities Firm & Real Estate  & lived a financially successful life. I am Feminine, but not a Feminist - Big Difference.
563 2018-02-23 22:33:51 Can we please start being adults and see that this wasn't socialism. This was a popularists dictatorship that had zero idea about how to long term invest in the country and depended on oil for everything. And now with collapse of prices, the corruption ruined them
564 2018-02-23 22:33:39 I'm worried too much protein can cause a bit of "roid rage" or damage parts of my body. Organs even. Tastes weird anyway. I also take fish oil and a multivitamin. And my daily baby aspirin. I'm getting old.
565 2018-02-23 22:33:30 I'm  not in favor of #guncontrol, but I don't support the #NRA either. The  reason I don't support them is because they pay politicians to get their  way. That's no different than the banks, oil companies and other  corporations. I guess you can say I'm anti-lobbying.

569 2018-02-23 22:32:51 #ConfessionsFromANeighbor You should try Vaseline it works better than that vegetable oil you are using.
570 2018-02-23 22:32:49 Try soaking them in baby oil on a cotton pad it will loosen them up
571 2018-02-23 22:32:48 I use Avocado oil & Castro oil for pree poo & I use Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter shampoo, conditioner & deep treatment Masque for oils I used bunch of diff oils all the time but coconut oil stay winnin
572 2018-02-23 22:32:46 Oil > Agriculture.
573 2018-02-23 22:32:43 Looking at it from the perspective I have, since 2000, the oil sands had lots of relatively cheap opportunities to reduce intensity but no real incentive; the primary incentive has been to raise output.  I would like a tighter  & longer (past 2030) focus on the intensities
574 2018-02-23 22:32:37 And they say our oil is bad, f them

581 2018-02-23 22:32:02 But uh uh eh the NRA $ is only relevant on gun-related votes. The correct graph would show the NRA $ vs gun control $. Pharma and oil don’t care about how legislators vote on gun legislation.

590 2018-02-23 22:31:08 The NDP needs to detatch itself from Big Oil even if it costs AB which is probably going to lose next election anyway. Jaggy Singh must take a "No pipelines" position.
591 2018-02-23 22:31:06 Like someone mentioned earlier, you can't just give a oil block to any friend/woman. Success is birthed when opportunity meets preparation. Woman definitely had more than the dirty "Babangida's sidekick" credential.  We may not know what it is but yea...

600 2018-02-23 22:30:16 Nope, engine oil :(
601 2018-02-23 22:30:05 The fact that you are asociating yourself with an event featuring crack pots, conspiracy theorists, and snake oil salesmen shows how truly out of touch you are with your district.
602 2018-02-23 22:30:05 It shouldn’t take this long for them to change my oil I’m so ready to go
603 2018-02-23 22:29:51 Not sure what your point is, but my motivations are to preserve this place for my children and their children. The vast majority of scientists that have absolutely no ties to big oil warn of the consequences, I prefer to not take a chance with their futures. What motivates you?

606 2018-02-23 22:29:40 My hope is that they are finally beginning to realize that their emperor doesn't have any clothes. I don't want to be naive, but maybe it is beginning to dawn on them the snake oil they've been sold by politicians and the NRA.
607 2018-02-23 22:29:35 I guess the bottom of the pan had a residue of oil on the base? Brillo pad, followed by your usual method of cleaning. It’ll disappear eventually.
608 2018-02-23 22:29:28 Ok please stop using coconut oil as a moisturizer. It will cause so many facial problems. The oil is so thick it just sits on your skin and the amount that does get absorbed just clogs your pores....plssssss don’t use cooking oil as a moisturizer pls

655 2018-02-23 22:21:55 Switching sides in somebody else's war is good practice for switching sides in a war to protect your own country. Reminds me of democracy-hating #KochBrothers father who built an oil refinery for Hitler during the war. Charles & David are still counting the money
656 2018-02-23 22:21:51 I made cookies using mostly coconut oil and vegetable (soy bean) oil for the fat content. In spite of peanut butter, cocoa, cloves, and vanilla, they taste... kind of bland? I mean, I'll take 'em, but I'm still dismayed. :-\

678 2018-02-23 22:17:47 Oil issue in recent years is mostly down to BP etc playing politics. There's plenty oil out there. And reason revenue is so abysmal is WM management of industry - mainly tax exemptions & financial incentives to oil co's. Plus mis-spending revenue of course.

685 2018-02-23 22:17:16 Ok no. Why would you ever be “fine” w/ farming cows when animal ag account for 51% of all GHG emissions. If we stopped using transportation, electricity, fuel, oil, gas, etc all together we’d still exceed our carbon equivalent GHG emissions (565 GT) by 2030 from livestock ALONE.

695 2018-02-23 22:15:18 Part of the point, I think, is that Canada didn't have a Great Recession. We doubled down on what we were doing to send debt levels and housing prices skyward, got banks out of their liquidity crisis and then doubled down again when oil prices collapsed.

700 2018-02-23 22:15:02 The 1956 movie “Giant” is an epic film to help us understand our “time” now. Racism, class and drinking flow at the spark of Texas oil. Energy drives politics and this drama gives action to the fight for “justice for all” when power from easy money rules. #classicfilm

706 2018-02-23 22:14:19 Big thanks to Bumgardner and Flasher Oil Inc. for their $250 donation!!
707 2018-02-23 22:14:18 But there isn’t a cost. Oil prices have been hurting Russia’s economy for years. The country has been implementing austerity measures. Sanctions gives Putin an out.
708 2018-02-23 22:14:13 For heavens sake Trump, May, Merkel, Macron and other civilised nations stand up to the barbarians bombing Syrians and enforce a no fly zone. If there was oil at stake it would be different.

713 2018-02-23 22:13:19 Lol girl. Vaseline for moisturizer, brown sugar and coconut oil for exfoliating, then I got a face cream and body wash from @EvieSkincare. Really did wonders to my skin.

718 2018-02-23 22:13:02 Africa is a resource rich country. Without the white man stealing their diamonds, gemstones, precious metals, ores (and now oil!) they’d own us.

726 2018-02-23 22:11:58 I find a lot travel back and forth from the oil fields.  Leave the family here and just fly in and out. So technically satellite families if their spouses don't work here in BC. That whole concept is going to be an interesting one when more details come out.

738 2018-02-23 22:09:51 This guy works for oil and gas companies, the IWDG works for oil and gas - helping them to get permission to pollute with noise and drilling - and then preaches conservation.

740 2018-02-23 22:09:35 I bought an argan oil bottle that works as a primer/brightener from physicians formula and I noticed my brows got darker inadvertently by using it as a primer.  I read up on it and people say it helps with growing lashes/brow hairs. 
741 2018-02-23 22:09:29 They still need overhauling, piston change, spark plugs and oil change too. Competition too tough #LQvMS #HBLPSL
742 2018-02-23 22:09:23 I am also surprized that @cathmckenna & her #BleedingHartLiberals allow single hull foreign Oil tankers up Canada's St Laurence Seaway carrying #CrudeOil for Quebec? Who does she work for? 
Allow Quebec to dump raw sewage. Allow Quebec's foreign oil in the Seaway. No pipelines?
743 2018-02-23 22:09:22 I've done 1 A3 painting, 1 coloured pencil drawing, 2 A3 oil pastel drawings, and 2 A4 oil pastel drawings.

746 2018-02-23 22:08:36 $chk increased oil production compared to nat gas. One of the reasons for big beat.
747 2018-02-23 22:08:33 We're working on it Jim, oil dependence sucks for other reasons than the fiction of manmade climate change. namely carcinogens, I know you're intelligent, unlike most of Hollywood, look into it deeply man, and come back, Al Gore was a bullshit artist.
748 2018-02-23 22:08:04 Article is dated August 2013 and refers to the period between 2007 and 2012. So, I guess, the growth in the US oil industry was the fault of the Alberta conservatives?
749 2018-02-23 22:07:59 you two are two dumb Rutgers grads who should be in New Brunswick dropping food in hot oil .
750 2018-02-23 22:07:52 Get over yourself. "The nation's welfare"? Not by a long shot.

#tarsands oil needs 80 per barrel to break even. That price will NEVER happen again.

Our unsullied coast supports 16.7 BILLION in economic activity with tourism alone.

Sounds like the only economy at risk is ours.

756 2018-02-23 22:07:06 That would be the same as Venezuela promising oil they haven't pumped out of the ground or gold they don't have to back cryptos.
757 2018-02-23 22:07:00 Too right! Been loathing them for years, have seen friends and family members fall for their shit, will dance in the street if those two bit snake oil sellers go down the drain of history.

They seek methods to get rid of us, including designer viruses.
762 2018-02-23 22:06:12 I include tax cuts that are being funded through debt as manipulation. Oil is another area being manipulated. share buybacks are not sustainable.

767 2018-02-23 22:05:31 The only sad thing about #maddow is the people she uses. They’re very much the dupe; she’s the predator. 
These things all end at some point. Just like snake oil...

I just sort of laugh. Like hillary saying “what gets me (HRC) out of bed is helping others”
It’s really funny.
768 2018-02-23 22:05:16 You didn't read the article either. They aren't drilling for oil.
769 2018-02-23 22:05:10 #CookingTip: Be very careful when draining hot pasta or pouring hot liquids like soup from a pot into a bowl. A splatter of boiling water, hot soup, or hot oil can burn you.
770 2018-02-23 22:04:43 I wonder if these Fox "entertainers" are really this stupid or if they are following the Trump snake oil brand when all they are doing is cashing in on the MAGA's blind ignorance.

786 2018-02-23 22:03:09 Where does the membership cash money go? IWDG loves publicity, gets Consultancy contracts, pays senior members salaries when working for oil and gas - helping them to get drilling permits. Fake conservation group loves money. Don't be fooled, follow the money.
787 2018-02-23 22:03:03 Nfld & Lab has low emissions power grid and exports power, also sitting on 18 gigatonnes of CO2 in offshore oil reserves and busy pumping it out of the ground for export, provinces seeking credit for good power grids ought to get dinged for bad exports

808 2018-02-23 22:01:18 I'd use it in creamy scrambled eggs or on steak (which I didn't make that often) and occasionally on toast, but mostly I'd do fried eggs in olive oil and let the yolk take care of the toast. I'm not saying I don't like butter or that it's not delicious, but I'd pick chocolate

Went back to the place, turns out they didn't tighten the bolt on the drain pan well enough. Fixed it and refilled my oil no problem. Were very friendly about it. Good people.

836 2018-02-23 21:57:30 I'm confused.  Does the CBD oil have any relevance to the alt-right?

839 2018-02-23 21:57:16 Tanf was different. Conoco was a deal and US sabotaged it. That way Efrin would still be in ypg hands and Russia would get oil fields for government
840 2018-02-23 21:57:04 But only if they know that you support wildlife, and don’t eat chocolate that contains Palm Oil!!

845 2018-02-23 21:56:05 Yes, & it is literally feasible as well given the definition. The variation in the term may swing depending on one's vision. I can now clearly see a world of clean, safe, abundant, reliable, affordable energy, and the elimination of oil, coal, gas, nukes and most bio-energy.
846 2018-02-23 21:55:54 Figure out how to turn people directly into oil. Will save you time, killing us all
847 2018-02-23 21:55:43 US has ability to atop Turkish airforce jn 5minutes in Efrin but they choose to rather sabotage a deal that could prevent Efrin safety for keeping oil in their hands. Here we can see how dirty is imperialism from both big powers

861 2018-02-23 21:52:21 I get so depressed when the time comes to get an oil change.

868 2018-02-23 21:51:01 Another poor decision by @JustinTrudeau 
Canada..could be doing quite well..producing at $60 oil..
Oh that’s right..Saudi Arabia..wanted them to cut production..
869 2018-02-23 21:50:49 They will also flock to someone selling snake oil at the right price.
870 2018-02-23 21:50:46 US blocks any deal for those oil and gas fields.
871 2018-02-23 21:50:46 60-80% actively vote for Putin (pro-west pollsters) but they do not like so many pro-west liberals in the govt. In Yeltzin years Russia was sold out and almost destoyed like SFR Yugoslavia. When Putin came to power, he returned oil fields into govt hands and budget got x3 larger.
872 2018-02-23 21:50:38 Are we going to have Neken handlebars and Ams oil appearing in the game?
873 2018-02-23 21:50:24 The parking lot, where you could change your own oil like a real man.
874 2018-02-23 21:50:10 The day is near, the deadline's here, Chiarelli does his dance

877 2018-02-23 21:49:59 She also recommend folic acid, vitamin B12, b vitamins, fish oil. Had me stop drinking diet sodas and other diet changes. I wasn't cured of my depression but it was less severe and more manageable. My internist approved and agreed with everything the naturopath recommended...
878 2018-02-23 21:49:59 What is your cheaper superior technology?  Windmills and solar panels?  Both are more expensive per kW hour produced than coal, nat gas or oil. If it weren't for tax write offs they would cost more than what they produce.
879 2018-02-23 21:49:50 Snake oil salesman.
880 2018-02-23 21:49:36 I’m sure it is - I just fell like the way they are marketing it on that site is super spammy.  Just reads like they are selling snake oil… 
881 2018-02-23 21:49:36 Well I didn't check where the oil filter came from you are right. But as I said it was built in the UK and probable most of the component parts I would as at a guess where sourced in the UK. Bad me must do more research 
882 2018-02-23 21:49:16 US is in real control of Deir Ezzour oil fields not Kurds

889 2018-02-23 21:47:33 They’ve always been for it, they side with Oil Comps over landowners in *every* pipeline dispute. Conservatives talk a big game against government intrusion, but unless it’s a program for the poor or the FBI investigating a Republican President, they don’t care.
890 2018-02-23 21:47:18 Love the stunning colours and the fact that they are nourishing too. I currently wear a lip stain that although lasts all day till removed with cleansing oil does need to be taken a break from at times because it dries my lips :(
891 2018-02-23 21:46:41 Rather than digging a hole to China to send them our oil we can dig it to India instead.
892 2018-02-23 21:46:36 Much better, hope it lasts. Mine had the thermostat replaced last week, it’s booked again for oil consumption and aerodynamic malfunction next week.
893 2018-02-23 21:46:36 So as soon as I check my account on payday...my dashboard flashes..time for an oil change. This literally happened at the same time. I swear the adult universe is so petty.

896 2018-02-23 21:46:23 Just like politicians take money from gas and oil, pharmacy, coal, auto makers, alcohol makers, and others. Do you not think these other lobbyists aren’t getting deals that convince politicians to stop things that can affect our lives, some which injure? If not, you need to look!

920 2018-02-23 21:43:53 This is interesting, acutally. Because I've read that the incident was result of the sectret deel between the group in CONOCO oil fields and the govt. side. Under this deal the fealds were meant to be handed to the govt. forces. Information leaked at the final stage.

972 2018-02-23 21:37:42 The hypocrisy of this Government is mind boggling... has pipeline to dump raw sewage; not a thing said about this, yet worried about oil pipeline due to environmental concerns...  These Clowns have to go...

974 2018-02-23 21:37:30 Compare the oilmen’s political contribution to the Pharmaceuticals. Texans benefit from oil and gas, where Pharma is sucks the life from children with nearly mandatory vaccinations with protection from lawsuits. That inability to sue came about by bribery.

977 2018-02-23 21:36:44 Linus Pauling made brilliant discoveries in molecular chemistry that earned him a Nobel prize in 1954. Then later he basically devolved into a snake oil salesman insisting that Vitamin C could cure cancer. Many believed him because, hey, Nobel Winner. But it was still stupid.

980 2018-02-23 21:36:28 They’re a mix of astrology and car-dealership-snake-oil-add-ons. “What if we made a financial product with worse returns and higher risk than a simply index fund, and then charged people fees hundreds of times higher?”
981 2018-02-23 21:36:25 From a millionaires perspective you’re probably right. Not so much for the rest of us who want healthcare, clean air and water, and parklands without oil pipelines
982 2018-02-23 21:36:24 CONOCO oil fields are directly controled by the US SOFs. As many other sections in the region. There are US bases in "Kurdish" controled parts of Syria.

993 2018-02-23 21:34:57 With regards to public response the oil pollution in the #RiverLea in London, people should be less critical of @EnvAgencySE who have been out working tirelessly for days to resolve the situation and should instead direct their anger to whoever dumped the oil in the first place.

1006 2018-02-23 21:33:31 So up until June 1941,the Soviet Union provided the Nazis with oil, wheat, grain, iron, etc etc under the Pact to dismember  Poland.  oddly the hungarinas 1956, the Czechs, 1968, the Poles 1990 were not keen on the the Russians.  For the Germans,w ell who built the Berlin Wall?

1012 2018-02-23 21:32:52 I wonder, does snow stick on spilled oil?  Maybe the pipeline could solve our driving on snow issues!

1014 2018-02-23 21:32:31 Additionally, if your having trouble keeping oil at bay, using Original Mineral Veil can really help the situation. Not too mention you can put it in your bag and touch up through out the day.

1016 2018-02-23 21:32:31 You may want to try using BLEMISH REMEDY™ MATTIFYING PREP GEL even if you don't have blemish prone skin this is really great at controlling oil or COMBO CONTROL MILKY FACE PRIMER.
1017 2018-02-23 21:32:14 For non microwaveable kind, 1 cup popcorn to 2 tbsp oil. Coat the kennels completely in oil. Make sure the pan's lid is tight. To test if the pan is hot enough, put 3 kennels wait for them to pop, remove and put the rest out flat. Shake the pan every so often
1018 2018-02-23 21:32:03 it has olive oil and vinegar dressing nd all the eggs and avocado make it real creamy texture :P
1019 2018-02-23 21:31:53 Crude-by-rail chugging along. The #NEB reports that 152,151 barrels per day of oil were exported from Canada in December, the highest level since last March. Still well short of CAPP's Western Canada capacity estimate of about 754,000 bpd.

1022 2018-02-23 21:31:40 As I mentioned in a different comment above it’s probably to do with aging of society and with the male dominated industries (fishing oil forestry). Women more likely university educated and more likely to go abroad. That’s an educated guess at this stage.

1041 2018-02-23 21:29:05 I’m a fan of Wilber, yes. Integral theory. These conversations can be quite comical. They seem to be like oil and water. I think its important to find the truth in what the other is saying, and build the bridge. Both can be true from a higher perspective.

1045 2018-02-23 21:28:09 Volunteer so the *charity* iwdg can get publicity and get more oil and gas contracts. They are environmental Consultancy seeking profit not a conservation group. Some members don't know. Senior members do this for cash not conservation.

1059 2018-02-23 21:26:02 The rise in bmi was sudden too and it followed the rise of sunflower oil consumption by a couple of years. There might be another reason but the correlation exists.
1060 2018-02-23 21:26:01 Get yourself a mechanic like Sabaru in Colorado Springs. Today I learned the fourth oil change (with regular oil) is free. So today’s oil change was free! #winning

1069 2018-02-23 21:24:37 I bought celestial seasoning ginger turmeric tea recently, because it was new and I wanted to try. Been brewing it with hot water/ a splash of whatever nut milk I’ve had and blending with coconut oil. Usually throw a cinnamon stick into my mug too
1070 2018-02-23 21:24:35 I need beard oil
1071 2018-02-23 21:24:30 I found some pictures. It might be very interesting because sunflower oil started to be used for cooking because it's easier to use it than animal fat. Basically, people started to use it massively when refined oil became available, so the rise was sudden.
1072 2018-02-23 21:24:25 All of my beard oil gone...any young girls got some to lend me?
1073 2018-02-23 21:24:12 My hair is so naturally dry that the only time I need to wash it is once a week after product build up. I don’t even get acne around my hairline or forehead because there’s just no oil

1080 2018-02-23 21:23:16 Massacres? Really? Seems like France has had a few in the last few years. Do they not regulate guns in France? Gosh and I thought guns in fascist countries were highly regulated yet all those people starved and were killed by their own governments.

1109 2018-02-23 21:18:44 I think they taste more like cabbage I like grilling them with a drizzle of olive oil and Parmesan cheese.
1110 2018-02-23 21:18:43 Thinly slice half the head
Season gently.
Dice 5 smoked rashers. 
Fry rashers on a pan with a teaspoon of vegetable oil.
Stir cabbage in.
Will cook quickly so keep it gently  moving.
1111 2018-02-23 21:18:42 Yeah the pharma and oil lobbies are sewer rats too. We'll get to them eventually.
1112 2018-02-23 21:18:35 Why not. Disney and Nickelodeon cable are soft kiddie porn now.
1113 2018-02-23 21:18:31 This hashish oil tho... 
1114 2018-02-23 21:18:27 US is there on the Eastern border, to makes sure Iran does not take over Syria that is their goal. Russian Mercenaries want the oil fields.
1115 2018-02-23 21:18:27 @iwdgnews promoting their corporate consultancy. Those members who care about conservation are just being used to get attention for the business. Senior iwdg members are really just a consultancy for hire. Money not conservation. Not volunteers, oil and gas corporate contracts.
1116 2018-02-23 21:18:16 Wtf oil changes shouldn’t even take that long, that’s sus

1120 2018-02-23 21:17:49 We’ll just get it from Europe then. Meanwhile we just turn of their oil, water and electricity till they say sorry.  Oh yeah, and blockade their sodding submarines in whilst we’re at it. If they’re not going to play nice.....
1121 2018-02-23 21:17:30 This tweet caught my attention because I saw the words Peak and Oil and then laughed at how serious we took that theory when I was in college #hellofracking
1122 2018-02-23 21:17:25 Actually .. it cannot as the Trudeau, Liberal & NDP govts are hell bent on shutting the oil production down !!!
1123 2018-02-23 21:17:25 Looking at Republicans Budget you’d think the big economic problem is the rich are too poor and poor are too rich. Big oil should be the first to lose entitlements; not poor, starving or sick. Corporations and the 1% have over $4 trillion in cash. Tax the rich #FridayFeeling
1124 2018-02-23 21:17:05 All the time. Brownfield sites to get more out of them. It’s very strictly regulated. When was the last time you heard of an oil spill in the North Sea?

Who drives fleet trucks you ask...

Oil and Gas companies
Electrical service companies

Mechanical repair companies
Engineering companies

Who does these jobs you ask.....

Most of them are gun owners.
1131 2018-02-23 21:15:53 That's not what happened in Venezuela.
Oil rich country that elected a socialist government. Started off well.
Corbyn dream.
But very soon ran out of money food on the shelves.
Now abject poverty and misery.
All nations that have tried it have failed.
The poorest pay the highest.

1144 2018-02-23 21:14:09 Note she was given  Dry oil well. She got this oil well during the period of obj. She burnt through her finance to find  the oil she is profiting from. She could have easily just given up but she didn't. She was relentless
1145 2018-02-23 21:14:07 To the people who just start their vehicles and go. You're really fucking up your car. Let that fucker ideal. For at least 3 min.. let the oil get through your engine. Just a lil hit to save ya cash.
1146 2018-02-23 21:13:59 The oil fields are of no economic value to the US it is small potatoes to them. for 3+ years Assad was happy buying oil from Daesh

1152 2018-02-23 21:12:49 The @iwdgnews iwdg exist to get corporate contracts from oil and gas companies etc. It is  all about profit. It is a consultancy which works for money - not  conservation. Disgraceful abuse of charity status to make private money.
1153 2018-02-23 21:12:47 Liberals are not pro oil. If they were we would be exporting more.
 Trudeau would have secured a deal with India. He didn't even mention it.
 Pipelines would be built. Drillers would not be fleeing for Texas .
1154 2018-02-23 21:12:29 Oh yes, I am! My mom doesn't mind that I smoke in her house. She doesn't smoke. She is using CBD oil for her broken arm. The hubby doesn't smoke either. He doesn't care either that I do it. He knows I have pain issues and stress & rather that then having to pop pills.
1155 2018-02-23 21:12:27 You can get fish oil at any pet store lol.
1156 2018-02-23 21:12:22 @talkRADIO George. Corbyn government should not seek to control but by covenant as in Norway hold onto largest share in telecoms and oil and subsidise public transport heavily so private operators make just enough.

1169 2018-02-23 21:10:34 Massacres are always upsetting. I agree with you. It’s upsetting wherever it happens, however it happens. Sadly, globally, massacres occur daily. Unfortunately, the news only likes to talk about Eurocentric massacres that occur in ways convenient to push leftwing narratives.
1170 2018-02-23 21:10:27 Build Energy East.  Build large sewage plant near St. John NB with fed tax revenue from increased price/sales of oil.  Allow Montreal & Quebec City to pump their crud every 3 months to be processed at east coast treatment plant.  Win win win.

1196 2018-02-23 21:08:15 The law of supply and demand.Doctors need an incentive to come to our province,pay themwell,show respect and assist with transfers ,housing etc.When oil etc supplies go down the price goes up.Same thing isn’t it.
1197 2018-02-23 21:08:13 I don't use oil at all
1198 2018-02-23 21:08:05 I use lubriderm for my whole body and then bio oil and palmers coco butter for my tummy, chest and thigh area.
1199 2018-02-23 21:08:02 The Russian thing? Do you know what is going on in Syria?
So complicated, but Basically, Putin's protecting Syria because they have oil.  Israel wants to put a pipeline thru Syria.
US MIC want to go to war against Russia bc of Israel and oil.
Hence media frenzy against Russia.

1201 2018-02-23 21:07:54 I'm strongly in favor of debates and discussions, but Jordan Peterson is a snake oil salesman and professional misogynist. He shouldn't be regularly platformed at major events where he can expand his little cult reach. It just annoys me so many people on our side look up to him.
1202 2018-02-23 21:07:49 I still swear by African Extracts, use their face wash, night and day cream, serum, face polish and oil , the only other thing I use is the Avene eye and lip contour

1206 2018-02-23 21:07:15 @cthagod that whole interview gave me brain cancer..she and her husband are slinging snake oil and dancing circles around questions. She thinks real highly of herself.
1207 2018-02-23 21:07:04 Is so good for you though ! I put a Lil tea tree oil on mine
1208 2018-02-23 21:06:47 We did it in a slightly different form for many years a long time ago. Until we get our act together with fission, fusion, and renewables, we need the fuel unless you want to go in importing (Scot Gov seem quite happy to use US shale oil).
1209 2018-02-23 21:06:45 i have a total of 5 tinctures, 1 flower essence, and 3 essential oil blends in my tiny purse
1210 2018-02-23 21:06:43 Except that is wrong.  Their contributions add up to maybe 1% of any congressman's donations.  Pharma and Oil rank much higher with their cash donations.  Not to mention studies have shown that 1% has little to no effect of votes.
1211 2018-02-23 21:06:37 Arre... I don't mean the "sad type" health food. i meant healthy food which is also tasty. Like home cooked stuff, or stuff which isn't necessarily soaked in oil. That. :)
1212 2018-02-23 21:06:36 OBJ gave her an oil block, she's now boasting to be a billionaire
1213 2018-02-23 21:06:32 Also bear in mind that backing the #Petro with oil reserves is against the Venezuelan Constitution-btw approved during Hugo Chávez tenure. Article 12 establishes that mineral and hydrocarbon deposits are public domain assets and, therefore, inalienable (can’t be sold or given up)
1214 2018-02-23 21:06:27 First you gotta find out what kinda oil to buy

1219 2018-02-23 21:05:55 Worked in TX pretty well. But, he wasn’t a coward.
1220 2018-02-23 21:05:51 Are you saying drilling for oil is exactly the same process as fracking?
1221 2018-02-23 21:05:46 @POTUS OIL PRICES-Went from $38 a barrel too $64. What is going? Do we not produce enough oil to make it affordable for Americans?  Obama care repeal and replace--Nothing replaced it yet.  Prices climed in Jan again, TOTALLY unaffordable.
1222 2018-02-23 21:05:18 So I've snagged this Instagram/Twitter post of yours. This is rather disheartening, even moreso than suspicious. I've mentioned Russian oil many times. Invest globally, sure but I wonder to what degree the Russian Parliament Finance, answers to, Putin. Thanks for this
1223 2018-02-23 21:05:18 Dubai actually started buying American oil for its refineries. Of course oil is important, but doesn't mean you need to pump your own oil to put gas in your tank. The points you are making are ridiculously childish, make me feel stupid to even explain to you!

1230 2018-02-23 21:04:36 I've added extra hydration and haven't noticed any decrease in oil production.
1231 2018-02-23 21:04:33 ask @iwdg how much they get from Oil and Gas companies. Not conservation. Just profit for senior group members. @iwdg is a corporate consultancy faking it as a conservation group.
1232 2018-02-23 21:04:32 You’d like one episode where he goes up against the more traditional kappa. He wins the final round cause he put an oil on his plate to keep it from drying out, cause he was tired of that always happening.
1233 2018-02-23 21:04:32 It is like there is not one single Liberal or socialist in this entire country that understands that Canada's equalization payments are only possible because of the oil and gas in western Canada.  Our social infrastructure will collapse without it.
1234 2018-02-23 21:04:31 So .....b-OIL-utiful. I would love to #win this. Thanks  xxx
1235 2018-02-23 21:03:58 oh no. when the bacon cooks, it's better than any oil or butter dressing on the turkey. and the drippings make the best gravy you've ever had.
1236 2018-02-23 21:03:52 I’m referring to 2007, then 2010 threats. I knew Cal very well & he certainly saved the Oil the first time. But this team was in the assistance program in the 2000s. Then Katz wandering around Seattle was real. Bettman held firm on letting them move. Was some poker, yes it was.
1237 2018-02-23 21:03:52 No, but when I hear about a massacre, it upsets me just as much as it does Americans.
1238 2018-02-23 21:03:42 Yep. It's a bit spinach like, so I treat it the same. Tastes nice wilted with a little oil and garlic too, really simple, nice with miso and rice, that kind of thing.

1244 2018-02-23 21:02:46 Haha wow. Coming from someone in the USA, a country that literally sticks its nose in every other country's business. I'd like to think that we've moved on since those days but you're clearly stuck in that mentality. Oh 235 years ago actually, maybe you need to take some classes?

1248 2018-02-23 21:02:16 I did some reading and the theory is only skin is your natural response to "cleaning" all the oil away. In transition I used hot water and a wash cloth do gently wash off excess oil while leaving what my skin needed.
1249 2018-02-23 21:02:07 The gag is sis I AM. i got beard butter, and coconut oil. I mean it grows, just not as full as i would like.

1251 2018-02-23 21:01:53 The @iwdg exist to get corporate contracts from oil and gas companies etc. It is all about profit. It is a consultancy which works for money - not conservation. The publicity is just a scam to get cash.

1261 2018-02-23 21:00:50 Get with the times. You obviously are owned by your donors. I hope they name oil spills after you so your legacy will live on forever. This here children is the Lisa Murkowski. She held out on a bill so she could accomplish her donors goals and continue to receive dirty money.

1263 2018-02-23 21:00:30 How bad is a ‘low oil pressure warning’ on a car?
It’s intermittent. Comes on maybe once every few days or so, generally while braking. And goes off after a few seconds.

1269 2018-02-23 20:59:19 We have oil. We don't need to invade countries to get it...
1270 2018-02-23 20:59:15 Guys like this used to sell snake oil off the back of wagons. Remember in the movie, “Little  Big Man” the snakeoil salesman, over the years, kept losing parts of himself, a leg here, an eye there...a tough business.

1277 2018-02-23 20:58:29 My small thing of olive oil fell out of the cabinet and exploded on the floor. I cleaned it up to the best of my ability, now my dog is very excited about licking the floor. This is fine.
1278 2018-02-23 20:58:13 Have you got some coconut oil? Use that on your armpit! It won’t sting and will heal quick as well as working as a deodorant to stop you from stinking 
1279 2018-02-23 20:58:05 2/ Public sector jobs are more mixed, however, in the male/female distribution than jobs in mining, manuf, and construction, which are predominantly male workforces. In general, human services are a growth area for the future; oil sands is not.

1281 2018-02-23 20:57:41 Today I called for Oil to continue higher... Check. The broader market to continue.... Check. And tech to bounce back... Check. A triple! I'll take it.  Congratulations, me.

1285 2018-02-23 20:56:29 I wash my towels just like I change my car’s oil: regularly, every 6-8 months whether it needs it or not.

1289 2018-02-23 20:56:06 God! What a nightmare situation for these people. 
Just shows how ineffective the UN is doesn’t it? Why aren’t UN personnel working to neutralize this terrorism in this country? What, no oil there? No gold there? Makes me so angry! The UN is a farse! A money pit of corruption!
1290 2018-02-23 20:56:05 When her oil smell better on you. 
1291 2018-02-23 20:56:04 IMO, SPX in gold will fall over 10+ years, possibly meaningfully...but equally importantly, this fall (if it takes place), may take place in a nearly-binary fashion.  Oil less clear - i do not think it will rise as much as gold, but IMO it is likely to rise.
1292 2018-02-23 20:56:04 Me neither, but the point was made a long time ago that while you’re welcome to your opinions, you have no actual say over here in the colonies 
1293 2018-02-23 20:55:56 @SuzieSaysSo thank you for sharing your story (Olive Oil Eyes) on @TheMoth! We'd love interview you on Palestinians Podcast!
1294 2018-02-23 20:55:55 You really don't know what you are talking about. While cheap or subsidized oil helps the airlines show more profit, for most parts they pay at the pump in whatever country they refuel. Marketing, equipment and operations management are important not fuel, same with shipping
1295 2018-02-23 20:55:52 Oil looks like a short under 63.5...
1296 2018-02-23 20:55:30 Oh listen to the oil painting 
1297 2018-02-23 20:55:23 Eh? Your talking pish, Scotland would not be bankrupt. With our whisky, fish, water, electricity production, world class food production, tourism We'd be fine.
Then there's the burden of our vast oil reserves, that we'd build a fund from like Norway.
1298 2018-02-23 20:55:08 Donald Trump pouring oil on troubled waters. Way to go. Unbelievable!!
1299 2018-02-23 20:54:43 This sectarian war has gone on for centuries. But it is not just about who succeeds Mohammed, it is about control of oil, ports, and trade with the West.

1303 2018-02-23 20:54:19 Isn't contractor profit oil share taxed? This should add to Government's take
1304 2018-02-23 20:54:17 Hi Lee,before starting to paint you'll need to apply several coats (stain block or stain killer).[Solvent based or any oil based]Apply the first coat where there are leak patches,for the next coat apply to the an area larger than the leaks and after it is dry start painting.
1305 2018-02-23 20:54:14 Tastes.   Like mud,  and oil
1306 2018-02-23 20:54:07 You work for the oil and gas industry and seem awfully involved in this effort.
1307 2018-02-23 20:54:00 What do you like not including oil and precious metals?

1311 2018-02-23 20:53:27 I think you have mistaken Bernie Sanders for Trump, also the United States is in Syria for the exact same reason, to install an oil pipeline for Saudi Arabia, and the people we armed in Ukraine against Russia are neo Nazis.

1315 2018-02-23 20:53:23 grab some oil sheen n spray it every night or even in the am too. it’s prob gonna take some time getting used to lol
1316 2018-02-23 20:53:18 plastic is oil, pesticides, herbicides, oil, maybe going green is good for health and the planet
1317 2018-02-23 20:53:11 Indeed, but how does SPX valued in oil or gold fare over next 10+ years?  Unless the bal of trade swings massively (which would take a long time and much capex), we're looking at colossal sectoral crowding out of pvt capex by UST issuance.  This augurs poorly for US industry, no?
1318 2018-02-23 20:53:10 Tell him to quit being a drama king- get on with moving oil to China!
1319 2018-02-23 20:53:06 I'm jealous of people who create visual art because you can just like post a pic and people will be like 'aww nice' but sending people your shit writing is so weirdly intimate and uncomfortable that I should probably take up oil painting

1323 2018-02-23 20:52:50 I understand why people respect the 2nd Amendment, but as we learn more, the systems must be updated.
1324 2018-02-23 20:52:43 Rubbing peanut butter on a stubbed toe acts as a painkiller, due to the oil in the peanuts.
1325 2018-02-23 20:52:35 Took my car to Nissan at 9am for an oil change, and the dude said it’d be done around 1.. I called and the guy is out until 2 for lunch and my car isn’t done  they really think I have nothing to do all day smh

1331 2018-02-23 20:51:45 Interesting. I guess there is a lot of oil in Syria that your patrons are eager to get their hands on.
1332 2018-02-23 20:51:39 I feel your pain, I have a similar issue. I use Vitamin E (body shop) with tea tree oil or Avene with Tea tree oil along with drinking apple cider vinegar daily, it has helped control mine considerably. May want to try if you haven't? I hope your situation becomes better.
1333 2018-02-23 20:51:04 Clearly you’re not a business man, economy is still strong, inflation is just about under control, pound where it should be. Oil price is a global issue so affects everyone. I will concede Brexit uncertainty is not helpful.
1334 2018-02-23 20:51:00 Fresh cut flowers, freshly baked cookies, scented candles, oil diffusers or air fresheners offer added appeal when hosting an #openhouse
1335 2018-02-23 20:50:52 Pretty sure we booted you Brits out of our business over 200 years ago and were able to do so because of guns. Not that ya’ll weren’t shooting back.

1337 2018-02-23 20:50:37 Thats a fair point. I wouldnt like the trade as an Oil fan. Mostly because a pick doesnt help this team. 

Side note, im on a lonely island here thinking i might be okay with a Nuge trade if the return is a legit top 4 RH D. J. Faulk comes to mind.
1338 2018-02-23 20:50:35 I’m tryna be in and out with this oil change, dead not tryna wait 1-2 hours

1348 2018-02-23 20:49:02 I believe Euro leaders took massive bribes from ISIS-stolen oil/money.  Sure its control was slashed by 90% in 2017, but 2012-2016 they made  US$1.5 million per day FREELY. Notice how discussion on that oil was  dead silent in the media/governments?
1349 2018-02-23 20:48:58 Taxing Canadians, which is what subsidies amount to, to help big foreign oil companies to make obscene profits while polluting the planet defines insanity.

1354 2018-02-23 20:48:22 .@realDonaldTrump says that if new sanctions don't work, "Phase 2" could be "very rough." Let's be clear: these new sanctions do not exhaust our non-military options with #NorthKorea. Phase 1 should cut off Chinese crude oil. And Phase 2 should never include nuclear annihilation.

1360 2018-02-23 20:47:33 Why does @DonaldJTrumpJr always have a thin sheen of sweat? Snake oil is a real thing?!
1361 2018-02-23 20:47:25 Came for an oil change and it turned into having to buy a car part

1364 2018-02-23 20:46:46 I feel so accomplished today, I woke up put a face mask on, gave both my dogs a bath, cleaned the house, went to Spin Class, got my oil changed and got a salad for lunch  #adulting
1365 2018-02-23 20:46:45 Is there anything the state can do to get someone to build an oil refinery here?
1366 2018-02-23 20:46:37 Its been speeded up because Trump is going down.  This along with opening up of National parks and protected areas to mining and oil drilling was part of the deal he made with the Russian Israeli triangle that got him elected.
1367 2018-02-23 20:46:34 The young otoya picked up the best herbs cause he wanted to make medicine and massage oil while he wonder if Azkiyi will forgive him soon as he felt lonely without him

1369 2018-02-23 20:46:05 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!

1375 2018-02-23 20:45:27 Yes. It's all economic capacity being used. Until then inflation is not a threat. Look at historical commodity price inflation in the UK and what caused it: basically the oil price hike and sterling floating. Not 'overspending' ever.
1376 2018-02-23 20:45:26 But takes billions from Oil royaltys, hypocrisy
1377 2018-02-23 20:45:04 This man is dangerous simply because he has been able to convince enough people that he knows what he's talking about.  When, in fact, he is as ignorant, if not more so, as they are; a bona fide snake oil salesman.

1384 2018-02-23 20:43:33 @jkenney @Alberta_UCP What is the UCP going to do to ensure engineering companies don't send more than half of oil sands projects engineering hours to places such as India or Korea!? Especially when our unemployment rate in AB is so high!? We are losing jobs and it's frustrating!
1385 2018-02-23 20:43:27 Idk is polymer a “ natural ingredient “ because that’s what they cook French fries in. Polymer oil, and high fructose syrup is a “ natural sweetener “ now. So fuck no natural foods are really expensive, that would restrict profits for the stockholders. So no.

1434 2018-02-23 20:36:37 Thanks Sam. But even if the plastic is recycled (and lots isn’t), it’s remains plastic, that never breaks down. I’m surprised that oil extraction is a smaller carbon footprint than paper making. And we all used to use paper and it seemed to work fine.
1435 2018-02-23 20:36:34 I feel like @garytaubes provided good evidence in The Case Against Sugar that sugar intake was increasing even through the 1800's and adding a lot of obesity in communities that could afford it. I think we could think of 1977 guidelines + veg oil + HFCS = 2018 obesity/ MetScrisis
1436 2018-02-23 20:36:28 Oh please chia loses every trade he makes. Seguin, wheeler, etc. Hall is elite and every team in the NHL would have loved to have him. The oilers just settled on Lars. Look at what the Avs got for Duchene, imagine what the oil could have gotten for Hall.

1464 2018-02-23 20:32:16 Biodegradable but disgusting none the less. The hypocrisy is in allowances of foreign oil while not allowing ours in. As you once eloquently put it a bunch of jack wagons lol

1495 2018-02-23 20:28:36 Main intuition to me looks like desire to forestall future nefariousness, based on perceived nefariousness by large organizations in the past (this is how the story of the railroads, oil trusts ,etc. is told (no idea whether it's true). Could the sun be used nefariously?

Any questions you have for me?
1502 2018-02-23 20:27:57 It’s got too many problems. Leaks a ton of oil, coolant and trans fluid. Dash lights and both tail and brake likes don’t work at all. Pretty sure there’s a short. All the suspension is garbage. I got it for $1000 and it’s just not worth fixing.
1503 2018-02-23 20:27:56 Never thought I’d say this.... but I’m tired of coconut oil lmaooo. It’s just too messy and the smell makes me wanna vom now

1512 2018-02-23 20:27:20 Drink lots of water. A few drops of peppermint & eucalyptus essential oils on the forehead & nape will help, too. (I use lavender essential oil too but idk if that helps the headache or not - but it sure helps my attitude lol)
1513 2018-02-23 20:27:12 No, If you take a good oil (100% natural and cold pressed) you can put 3 at 5 drops on it and massage the area gently :)

1515 2018-02-23 20:26:51 Gonna do an oil video when my period boobs get here lol
1516 2018-02-23 20:26:51 The distance that u can make with one filled oil tank
1517 2018-02-23 20:26:41 I only lecture people who are clearly in the wrong but are too ignorant to face facts. School shootings in my country since 1997 = 0. School shootings in the USA = 8 for this year alone. Clueless but at least children in my country don't have to worry about getting shot.
1518 2018-02-23 20:26:26 And none of it's as good as coconut oil (A friend tells me..)
1519 2018-02-23 20:26:03 I will talk about Gas and Oil tomorrow. Rigo igore rezvidzidzo.
1520 2018-02-23 20:25:59 I can tell they bout to wax me for this oil change. Idk why i came here 
1521 2018-02-23 20:25:47 Hemp oil can do it all. Plastics made from it are biodegradable 
1522 2018-02-23 20:25:42 My step dad came to my work and picked up my to take it for an oil change

1524 2018-02-23 20:25:28 Someone made me try vegan chocolate ice cream (without saying what it was).

It has chocolate and ice. But the cream is a mix of water,oil and infinite sadness.
1525 2018-02-23 20:25:28 .@h00kerpr0blemz is compiling a document of OIL testimony and educational materials on how this should have been done. if you want to share your experience (anon or not) please email: cassidy@problematik.com
1526 2018-02-23 20:25:18 Writing 'wrong' in capital letters doesn't change the facts. If I had cancer I would try #cannabis oil but there is no scientific evidence to support a curative effect in living breathing humans. Good theory and in vitro/in vivo (animals) but nothing clinical
1527 2018-02-23 20:25:14 Or on all the oil in NFLD and not a protester in sight.
1528 2018-02-23 20:25:10 The period of peak oil production began

1533 2018-02-23 20:24:44 Demand pricing. Everyone wants an oil change, so you pay more.

I'm sure it's that and not something more sinister and offensive. 
1534 2018-02-23 20:24:42 So Geoffrey, who works for EVO payments - a merchant acquirer and payment processor. Do you not like the satoshipay name?
1535 2018-02-23 20:24:40 666  I’m either searing the Shit out of my dabs or way too low, depending who you ask. I just live in IL &amp; oil can be hard to source so doing too low & wAste to taste isn’t cool with me
1536 2018-02-23 20:24:28 I wanna be oil
1537 2018-02-23 20:24:26 U mean ud trust ur house with them?   Its a deal then, u bring the dye and I'll bring beers and the cod liver oil tablets

1539 2018-02-23 20:24:05 Been a member for years, never used any discounts. Unless they gave the NRA some sponsorship cash or something, this is just a dumb PR move by the companies, imho.

1541 2018-02-23 20:23:51 Dad called up Sears to get a price for an oil change on his car - $25.
Has me call them to make an appointment and take it in next week for him - they quote me $34.
Same car. Calls were 15 minutes apart. :/
1542 2018-02-23 20:23:50 They said it would be 3 hours for my oil service tire rotation car wash  and vaccum and I was like alright. So I brought my homework and  I’ve gotten more done than I would at home. Plus they have free high end coffee. #winning
1543 2018-02-23 20:23:33 "When we drink a cup of coffee or spoon heated chicken noodle soup or chili out of a Styrofoam cup, we are also taking in small doses of chemicals that leach from the container. Heat activates this transfer, as does oil, acids and alcohol." - Chuck Norris

1545 2018-02-23 20:23:25 U.S. wishes to build new pipelines rather than allow Ukraine to use already existing ones that go thru Russia and Iran. It does not want Ukraine to have leader who nationalizes resources and instead allows U.S. corps to control tapping of Caspian oil.

1551 2018-02-23 20:22:58 a simple chopped salad with vinegar and oil always hits the spot. always.
1552 2018-02-23 20:22:52 Tax big oil back to 7%!  Cigarettes went over 1,000% since they started at .65 a pack.  Now they wanna add a buck fifty?  The workers get taxed the most and billionaire Harold Hamm pays the least.  No wonder it failed.  Disgusted and outraged.
1553 2018-02-23 20:22:50 You have that exactly right. All talk. Snake oil salesmen. Nothing he spews is logical. When when is he going to be removed?? Pence also.
1554 2018-02-23 20:22:33 I doubt they can hold the oil resources when Syrian need it most without attracting a lot of scrutiny internally and internationally. When ISIS is defeated, the other countries will leave the US alone. They love to brand themselves 'coalition' but they will be isolated. I hope..
1555 2018-02-23 20:22:26 I already told you that's because of the snake oil you sell. Income tax is effectively higher in parts of IN, but @illinoispolicy tried to sell the recent IL tax increase as non-competitive. People hear your BS and form opinions that life is better elsewhere. Lies, lies, lies.
1556 2018-02-23 20:22:20 My daddy sick as hell buying me this old ass 1924 cough syrup . This shit 50% castor oil

1560 2018-02-23 20:21:23 Cause it’s a scam, oil is already a valuable raw material. Making a coin to exchange the value of a raw material is pointless.

1573 2018-02-23 20:19:35 Surface Rights Federation meeting in Camrose today. Talking Redwater and how, unless overturned, upsets the polluter pay policy principles.  Concern the oil and gas left in reservoirs it not enough to pay for cleanup and reclamation.
1574 2018-02-23 20:19:33 @meinharrd @SatoshiPay @Stale_Bull so, Geoffrey, you work for NY EVO payments. You've worked for WorldPay. Do you see satoshipay as some form of threat?? Oh dear. Oh dear.

1593 2018-02-23 20:17:20 So I’ve been making this oil to put in Lyric’s hair. I have I say I like this batch better than the last one.

1598 2018-02-23 20:16:53 Crude oil is on the back foot, banning straws is just the start. #brexit Government are fast realising that all those plastic particles have been in the drinking supplies for decades and humans are dying from it with scientists unable to prevent it.
1599 2018-02-23 20:16:50 How crude oil is broken down
1600 2018-02-23 20:16:47 I was scared that I would burn my hand because of the sizzling oil so my stupid ass tried to drop a piece of toast in from high above. Needless to say I burned my shxt and fxcked up my moms kitchen wall and to top it off got my ass whooped too...

1607 2018-02-23 20:15:53 Is there any irony to the fact that the greatest snake oil salesman (maybe in history) actually just told a story about a snake in his rambling speech today? He certainly charmed his audience today with a ruffle of his immaculately curated (if a little orange) mane. #CPAC2018
1608 2018-02-23 20:15:46 Try frying your chips in sesame seed oil. The chinks do it thats that taste keeps you scoffing. Home made chips are better
1609 2018-02-23 20:15:42 You like bars of solid gold, Google stock, and futures in crude oil. Nothing else.
1610 2018-02-23 20:15:37 Where is McKenna, where is Suzuki, where are all the other environmentalists. They are always present and accounted for when it involves oil. Oh right, this is Quebec and it's ok there. Hypocrites....all of you.
1611 2018-02-23 20:15:23 @Louis_Allday ,and the destruction and complete obliteration of Mosul was to break the siege and free 2 million civilians REALLY ! More for the Oil and main reservoir of Iraq.

1613 2018-02-23 20:15:11 unlike the onion/daffodil story this one is 100% confirmed by me, mythbuster. The brawl in the same shop with the pizza shovel also involved hot oil from the fryer. That place is cursed. Remember the old woman ordered chips and dropped dead at the plastic table eating them?

1618 2018-02-23 20:14:39 Actually the magical thinking is that we are going to remove weapons to a degree that a violent person cannot get one.
1619 2018-02-23 20:14:38 Then you can agree, that any politician who receives money from ANYONE that wants green power, oil, Gun Control, or funding for a program is accepting a BRIBE. So ALL Politicians are being bribed.

1625 2018-02-23 20:13:50 Butter and oil is a good combo
1626 2018-02-23 20:13:48 They'll make you kill people for oil but they'll convince you it's for "Queen and country". I respect the military, my dad was RAF, but I don't respect the politics or politicians that send them to kill for oil over lies. Don't advertise to me. I'll rant ALL DAY, light work.

1640 2018-02-23 20:11:49 We live in a republic, actually - we vote democratically, but our country is a republic.

I’m sorry but you are obviously pretty clueless about this and I don’t have time to explain the basics. I highly recommend you take some American History and civics classes.
1641 2018-02-23 20:11:47 So, let me get this straight: the Kochs’ created a bill writing group(ALEC, tax free PAC?) to write bills favorable to corporations like gun manufacturers, health industry, pharma, oil & gas, etc. Then the Kochs, NRA & others put $$$ in the pockets of legislators to pass them.
1642 2018-02-23 20:11:46 Oil and gas companies invest anywhere between 45 to 80 billion dollars per year into the Canadian economy PLUS over $12b in government royalties. There is estimated to be over $1 trillion dollars worth of oil and gas on Canadian land. Your ignorance is outstanding.
1643 2018-02-23 20:11:34 When the US bombed Raqqa back to the stoneage to get their hands on Syrian oil through their Kurdish proxies the UN never batted an eyelid, when Syrians take measures to stop rocket attacks on Damascus the media fed numpties lose their minds

1648 2018-02-23 20:11:07 Gordon Brown thought of as a hero, stopped some banks failing, Tories wanted less regulation at that time.Corbyn’s policies are similar to those in N Europe. Chavez died & interference by CIA re oil etc
1649 2018-02-23 20:10:56 If you add pectin to olive oil, is it jelly?
1650 2018-02-23 20:10:48 Alright. Me doing an oil change myself went from being 10 dollars less than going to a mechanic to being 30 dollars more. I suck.
1651 2018-02-23 20:10:43 Other countries don't give trillions of dollars to the super rich, and other countries don't spend trillions on unnecessary military operations. 

We can't spend our money on healthcare because we're too busy causing terrorism in the middle east for blood oil.
1652 2018-02-23 20:10:35 it’s way to damn hot to be waiting on a oil change

1660 2018-02-23 20:09:56 she's making stuff up everything right wing is because of Russia, and I am sure other candidates get their finances from some middle eastern oil country, not everyone as soros and the Rothschild to support their presidential campaign

1662 2018-02-23 20:09:52 Today, Turkish warships harassed the surveying vessel of Italian oil company @eni #saipem12000 and threatened to sink it. The Italian navy had to go back. Is #Erdogan free to do whatever he wants when it comes to Europe?

I just bought the Kopari Discovery Kit without realizing it has coconut oil in it. 

Fuuuuuu
1671 2018-02-23 20:09:02 Geez, no wonder that poor boy is messed up in the head!  Ingesting gun oil and gun blue and ruining that perfectly good bacon.  Bless his little heart!
1672 2018-02-23 20:08:48 Ooh fun! Pro tip: a little machine oil across a piece of paper will keep the teeth sharp!
1673 2018-02-23 20:08:38 True! And vegetarian doesn't mean only "health food" 

About 35 years ago I was eating a bag of potato chips and someone said, "Oh, I thought you were a vegetarian!"

I turned over the bag and read, "Potatoes, oil, salt … what's not vegetarian?"

I had a change in 2011 to tell UAE to sell their oil supplies while they lasted & optimize their energy consumption.. basically don't consume all your supplies.. look at what they did now!! & I didn't benefit yet.
1678 2018-02-23 20:07:59 We must rid ourselves of old fashioned politicians with tired ideas and old fashioned thinking. It’s time for a new generation to take over. Just like oil, sooner rather than later, @lisamurkowski @SenDanSullivan and @repdonyoung will be our past. #BlueWave2018
1679 2018-02-23 20:07:55 Ugh, I thought they were taught to respect firearms? I can't imagine how horrible that tastes with all the gun oil all over it.
1680 2018-02-23 20:07:51 Ryan, I have to tell Gov. Susana Martinez to watch out because you are a wolf in sheeps clothing. You’ve been know to sell the lands to your buddies for oil, gas & strip mining. It will never be beautiful again!
1681 2018-02-23 20:07:48 @dysondoc Well actually, there’s a lot of theories about the oil:gas coefficient of different gases and their impact on lipid bilayers, or the effect on chloride channels of GABA receptors, or the electron spin of neurones...

**mumbles** No, we don’t know.

1697 2018-02-23 20:04:50 When elected President I will make sure America remains in the Paris climate accord. America will end our dependency on fossil fuels. One key component of my plan is legalizing hemp, the oil of which can be used in place of diesel fuel. #Adam2020

1735 2018-02-23 19:59:54 After recently watching Cowspiracy on netflix. I will say that the meat industry is evil and worse than oil for GHG emissions. Cows use more water than anything else alive. We need to stop the beef industry.
1736 2018-02-23 19:59:44 Lee, @Hanseizuremum Alfie needs full spectrum cannabis oil, which includes THC, to control his seizures. What H&B are selling is very crude and low quality industrial hemp extract, it will not help epilepsy or MS.
1737 2018-02-23 19:59:40 It is good to learn that Cannabis AND HEMP Oil has been legalised within MANY, MANY U.S States to help combat the pain of Artheritus, Epilepsy, CANCER etc. etc. THE UK GIMP GOVERNMENT WILL FOLLOW SUITE!!! Xx
1738 2018-02-23 19:58:55 in WW1 France, italy, england divided ottoman empire just for oil on north africa. something like that....
1739 2018-02-23 19:58:52 With all that recovery, why do we need to borrow money for financing our budget? What happened to all the IGR and the revenue from our oil sales? What about the revenue from other sectors?
1740 2018-02-23 19:58:44 Strip out suicides and number drops drastically. Cut out cop justified shootings and gang activity and it drops even further. Plus most that comes from a couple major cities. With tight regs, ironically.

1745 2018-02-23 19:58:18 If we'd get out of the way, Russia & the SAA would finish off ISIS for good. But because there are massive oil reserves there - oops, I mean, because Assad's an evil dictator - the US is going to need to spread democracy by supporting moderate terrorists and droning SAA soldiers.
1746 2018-02-23 19:58:00 Yeah but I'll never take sardines over the fancy Italian tuna in olive oil, which scratches the same itch for me. More expensive but so much better.

1752 2018-02-23 19:57:15 Um. Because for the most part that's not true? The fact their violence rate is as high, and higher in many cases, than before? That they just don't report on knife murders?
1753 2018-02-23 19:57:10 I was considering whether or not to get my oil changed since the light came on... even though I’m potentially trading it in this weekend. 
I can’t handle having warning lights on my dash. I just can’t. So, I’m having it changed (against everyone at work telling me not to)

1762 2018-02-23 19:56:15 Then you have to look at mortality rates due to violence post gun bans. Stabbing is pretty survivable. How survivable is being attacked with a bat by a much larger person, or standing near a pressure cooker rigged to explode? The 9/11 hijackers were armed with box cutters.

1764 2018-02-23 19:55:25 The not so joys of olive oil bp even if the cat seems interested. But it the only time it ever stung in my right ear. Of course I don't feel anything in my left ear as good as dead. Should I be concerned it stings when it never has done

How one lives is largely dictated by societal patterns beyond one's control.  Greens hypocritical for using anything related to oil?  Browns hypocritical for using anything natural, such as air and water!  Both ridiculous arguments.

1774 2018-02-23 19:54:00 @AlbertaatNoon oil travelling by rail is clogging up the rail system making it harder to transport grain and other goods to port and oversees.
1775 2018-02-23 19:53:36 Perhaps not but it increases the chances you'll be shot which is often fatal. If I were facing someone who's become violent I'd rather they didn't have a gun. If they have a knife I'm more likely to survive even if stabbed.

1784 2018-02-23 19:53:09 What is doesn't discuss is all the times that a armed security guard was present and was still outgunned by the active shooter with a rifle.

1786 2018-02-23 19:53:02 Sure, but we’re also at a point in time where we know the harms of the oil industry and really shouldn’t celebrate any aspects of it.... kinda how we don’t really celebrate OJ Simpson anymore. Our pride should change as we accumulate greater knowledge.
1787 2018-02-23 19:52:53 I think we all need to quit fighting. Get out of middle East. Forget oil. Use windpower. And get all the leaders of Countries that are only seeking personal money and power out. We'll start with ours first. Let our children grow up with peace.
1788 2018-02-23 19:52:49 It’s fun Dan and you know exactly how much (or how little) salt and oil is going into making them x

1793 2018-02-23 19:52:18 Give that Same oil block to another Nigerian woman on the street & see how rich she become in few months
1794 2018-02-23 19:52:15 "As the above examples demonstrate, the presence of a security guard or off-duty policeman when there is an active shooter is mostly ineffective unless the security officer is armed."
1795 2018-02-23 19:52:15 Coconut oil is great for most things!  it helps!
1796 2018-02-23 19:52:10 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
1797 2018-02-23 19:51:45 someone tell yifan to put some coconut oil in his hair
1798 2018-02-23 19:51:44 Some girl broke out this essential oil lotion in geology today, and our teacher thought there was a gas leak and called maintenance #otc
1799 2018-02-23 19:51:26 Do people not realize that oil is not just used for gasoline in cars or modes of transportation. Oil is used for pretty much everything from plastic chairs to kayaks to clothing to make-up. Educate yourself.
1800 2018-02-23 19:51:24 Spot on. The preening is insufferable.
1801 2018-02-23 19:51:24 But, but, the 12th century is one of the most interesting ones in Byzantium. Join us, we have olive oil.
1802 2018-02-23 19:51:22 when you spray oil on ya footback, rub it in, get dressed, forget you’ve got wooden flooring, go to walk & slip on the oil that landed on the floor. 

Nearly went arse over tit 
1803 2018-02-23 19:51:15 genetically they are pretty bad but I shower in cuticle oil every night
1804 2018-02-23 19:51:07 DISC training is the snake oil of management training. It's a trap!!!
1805 2018-02-23 19:51:03 Pressing phone while marinating in coconut oil is torture.
1806 2018-02-23 19:50:49 Seen it before.  Are the SRO's going to be armed?  Well yes they are.
1807 2018-02-23 19:50:41 Daffy duck or Olive oil....all 3 are cartoon characters!
1808 2018-02-23 19:50:38 will there be oil and bikini's involved???? ;D
1809 2018-02-23 19:50:30 I'm using oil pastels
1810 2018-02-23 19:50:24 The drive shaft apparently  It was shaking the whole way home and when I pulled onto the drive, oil was literally running like hell out of it  A mechanic my dad knows is picking it up on Monday 
1811 2018-02-23 19:49:39 Just saw a big ol jeep with a vanity plate bearing an oil derrick theme and it said "13 MPG" i hate this state
1812 2018-02-23 19:49:25 I know I've been cheeky with Mrs Alakija in the past.

But let's the honest,

She isn't the only one that benefited from an oil bloc.
Why don't we drag the others as well?
Is it because she maximised it the most or she's the most visible or she's the richest woman in Africa?
1813 2018-02-23 19:49:23 Also, a currency backed in oil would probably make its citizens some of the richest in the world

1817 2018-02-23 19:48:55 Today I woke up with an extreme oil leak from my car, my sister messed up her engine, and my mom just got into a car accident... is  Mercury in retro grade?
1818 2018-02-23 19:48:51 @AlbertaatNoon Why are people in BC so concerned about tankers shipping Alberta crude out to foreign markets but seemingly not about the tankers needed to bring foreign oil in for their consumption?
1819 2018-02-23 19:48:50 Vegans: why do you use coconut oil for everything cooking related? Don’t you know different oils heat to different temps and you probably shouldn’t be using coconut oil in every dish??????
1820 2018-02-23 19:48:45 With those guys in DC? More like naked Twister coated in olive oil...DC is perverted...
1821 2018-02-23 19:48:44 Came to get my oil changed, ended up having to get my tire patched cause it had a hole. NOW I JUST BOUGHT A FREAKIN TIRE BECAUSE IT WAS PRACTICALLY SPLIT OPEN. Wow being an adult rlly sucks sometimes
1822 2018-02-23 19:48:25 There is a common aspect: in all cases the symptoms "warrant" a band aid, the root cause (systematic system failure) is never addressed. It would require messing with the administration apparatus, and that's strictly verboten.
1823 2018-02-23 19:48:14 US crude oil futures settle at $63.55/BBL Settle up $0.78 or 1.24%
The US crude oil futures are settling at $63.55/BBL. That is up $0.78 or 1.24%.
The high for the day reached $63.73. 
The low reached $62.33
1824 2018-02-23 19:48:02 Met the sweetest lady while getting my oil changed, it’s so refreshing meeting someone from the older generation that is so accepting and understanding of everyone and their situations
1825 2018-02-23 19:47:47 I love the Ritual of Ayurveda in body cream, body mist, oil, scrub... The perfect combo!
1826 2018-02-23 19:47:39 I bought some coconut oil and it’s been much better! Thank you :) x
1827 2018-02-23 19:47:20 How do you acquire the rights to give these out? I called Lucas oil stadium and they never heard of you just curious cuzz
1828 2018-02-23 19:47:17 OIL (WTI) is hanging in there fairly well my good sir.  $63.50 last I peeked.  Just wanted to check in and say hello.  Listen to you later Bubba and have a good weekend.
1829 2018-02-23 19:47:11 Ok, I'm digressing, but still, why can I purchase with a prescription, but without insurance things like asthma inhalers in a German pharmacy for less that 10% of the cost, compared to an US one, with insurance?
1830 2018-02-23 19:47:10 I think they were saying how amazing something an GT alum made in 1938 is still being used today (which may mean the oil industry got lazy or that the engineer was extremely smart and no one could top him even today)
1831 2018-02-23 19:46:59 Remember: Saudi Arabia wants oil at $75
1832 2018-02-23 19:46:58 The Truth into Trump connection with Russia is knocking at our door if we don't wise up we could have a unending war, with devastation in the states

1838 2018-02-23 19:46:28 Q: What are your thoughts on architecture being used as a promise for a better future?
A: Seems like in every oil boom there's huge state intervention thru projects in #Venezuela. The gov. builds residential areas. #Caracas from 1950s-70s became laboratory for industrial projects
1839 2018-02-23 19:46:23 @AlbertaatNoon so I want to know what solutions these green people have to switch from oil to something else by next week? Cannot be done, we need oil right now to enable to develop new technologies
1840 2018-02-23 19:46:12 I just want to lay naked in the sun and have my slave rub my entire body down with oil,on every inch and curve of my body.......from the top to my toes. I bet none of you are worthy! My DMs are open #seekingslaves #findom

1843 2018-02-23 19:45:59 Just rubbed beard oil into my cuticles cause I couldn’t find any cuticle cream in my house and I can confirm it makes a very nice substitute

1846 2018-02-23 19:45:32 I know it’s easy to hate Alakija, but if they give you oil bloc will you not collect?
You’re probably going to be like nah, it’s too easy, I need to make it on my own. I know you, chop knuckle. My guy. 
1847 2018-02-23 19:45:31 And maybe even a few oil spills. Think about all the jobs those will bring in!
1848 2018-02-23 19:45:15 can someone please link me to whoever started the rumor that coconut oil is actually good for your face?

i just wanna talk.
1849 2018-02-23 19:45:12 No, they don't.   They have a plan that involves arming people inside the school.  Which just provides the opportunity for a kid with a baseball bat to get a gun.
1850 2018-02-23 19:45:11 into self defense. The 2nd Amendment doesn’t even give you the “right” to bear arms - it simply recognizes that you already have that right and the government doesn’t have the right to take it away.

This isn’t a simple subject and the philosophical implications are varied.
1851 2018-02-23 19:45:06 Tell us your thoughts  Where do you see the oil and gas industry in 5 years time?
1852 2018-02-23 19:45:05 to produce phony studies, year after year after year.

Anyone with ANY decency who is involved in ANY aspect of that must feel very sad, and I feel sad for them.

In the 1970s it was oil companies lying about Global Warming. In the 1980s it was tobacco companies lying about
1853 2018-02-23 19:45:00 Vattenfall’s Stalin: The company monitors 1,101 turbines. Some oil filters showed no trapped particles? Why? Because they were installed improperly.

1858 2018-02-23 19:44:22 Sorry to hear that dude! Nice warm water or holding a cup of tea can help aches. Cod liver oil as well!
1859 2018-02-23 19:44:03 God gave Americans the inalienable right to own a gun?  Well then we better start arming all those prisonners in jail, since we cannot take that right away from them.
1860 2018-02-23 19:43:57 Distortion is nature of oil markets. It is a disequilibrium system. Classical economic approaches involving flows (supply, demand, capital, etc.) that move toward EQ generally fall short. Comparative inventory focuses on dis-EQ system dynamics of inventory and price.
1861 2018-02-23 19:43:49 The right to bear arms is not just about “muh guns”. It’s about the right to self preservation. I understand guns scare you and you want to preserve yourself from them. That’s fine. Many countries have strict gun laws. America does not because the founders tied gun ownership/
1862 2018-02-23 19:43:44 Went to get an oil change and these boys slow
1863 2018-02-23 19:43:33 Of you're both oily and dry its usually a sign that something in your skin routine is stripping your skin. The skin produces excess sebum (oil) when its stripped as a defence mechanism.

1869 2018-02-23 19:42:10 Were you saying that last year when Larsson was anchoring the Oil blue line in the 2nd round and Hall was prepping to pick 1st overall again after a disappointing season in NJ.
1870 2018-02-23 19:42:07 No, mine don't.   

And I protect my rights by voting.
1871 2018-02-23 19:42:04 Asking if guns are related to gun violence is the dumbest question you can ask. How related to knife violence are knives? 
You’re boiling complicated conversations down to simplistic terms.
Men are several times more likely to commit rape then women. Should we castrate all men?

1896 2018-02-23 19:38:37 If elected officials that accept NRA funds are willing to live with mass murder as a reasonable cost of doing business, what hope does our environment have with so much $ from Big Oil, Coal, and other special interest groups sloshing around Washington? #BoycottNRA

1899 2018-02-23 19:38:24 The question isn’t the link between guns and “gun violence” because right there you’ve defined the link as immutably connected. The question is the connection between gun ownership (and freedom to own guns) and violence in general. Does gun ownership increase violence?

1903 2018-02-23 19:38:05 I love nice guys at oil change places that give you coupons, thank you kind sir 
1904 2018-02-23 19:37:50 Make sure that the products you're using aren't oil based and this can add to the problem. I would also recommend that you mask 3 times a week  (on separate days) using a clay based mask. This helps draws excess oil from the skin.
1905 2018-02-23 19:37:41 Hey @PatMcAfeeShow next week will be my first time in INDY for a conference near Lucas oil. Any suggestions on what to do there? Cheers
1906 2018-02-23 19:37:34 Funny thing is, they all made sure that everybody has to pay for healthcare, but never addressed the cost side, because regulating businesses is the one big no-no here. You can always find somebody to support gun control & confiscation.

1908 2018-02-23 19:36:52 Where did I say that? Obviously that’s not what I’m saying. You made a dumb point, I countered it. That’s how debate works. Don’t put words in my mouth.

1910 2018-02-23 19:36:47 So you are saying the people who voted for Trump knew he was a snake  oil salesman and therefore knew what they were getting into while pulling the lever.

I completely agree with your analysis, Brah.

1915 2018-02-23 19:36:29 Hello mr @GeorgeHeyman I know it’s probably just habit but the monies people in BC pay for in taxes aren’t donations to fight oil companies, could you let the other former foreign paid environmentalists know this as well please.
1916 2018-02-23 19:36:16 ok, i'm going to get my shit done this weekend. my apartment will be clean. my oil will be changed. the tasks i keep putting off will be TACKLED.

1919 2018-02-23 19:35:53 Just wondering... if oil goes back to the top, will Kilduff still be "the man who called oil's 2018 top"?
1920 2018-02-23 19:35:47 Add all the dry ingredients including the coffee into a mug. Preferably a large mug because it will most likely overflow. 
Then add the egg as well as the oil and milk to the mixure. Mix it up and then microwave it for roughly 2-4min. Hopefully it will be hundreds 
1921 2018-02-23 19:35:40 Dammit Scott, you're applying thought and reason to a Trump policy. Like oil and water, those two elements don't mix.
1922 2018-02-23 19:35:39 UPDATE 10-Oil climbs as Libyan outage, Saudi comments support #energy #oil
1923 2018-02-23 19:35:38 mixing a thick chunk of oil paint is what good pussy sounds like
1924 2018-02-23 19:35:36 Who’s wearing Starter?
1925 2018-02-23 19:35:36 Holy Hemp Oil is saving my life right now #theresilientlotus
1926 2018-02-23 19:35:14 Well I hope we got our strategic oil reserves replenished by then
1927 2018-02-23 19:35:13 Also you need to make sure that you're using the correct products for your skin type. For excessively oily skin one should be on water based products to provide hydration and not extra oil. I love dermalogica cause they have a double cleanse system.
1928 2018-02-23 19:35:00 Have you tried Chef Rony’s famous FATTÜSH SALAD: tomatoes, cucumber, fresh mint, onions, parsley and toasted whole wheat pita, lightly dressed with lemon, garlic, sumac and olive oil.
1929 2018-02-23 19:34:55 Like industrial farming killing soil making it grow the same fucking thing no birds or insects or wee hedgehogs just a guy in a tractor driving up and down wholly dependent on the oil industry
1930 2018-02-23 19:34:52 No, Trump, no one likes you and President of China is making his country number 1 in solar, leaving us in the dust and dirt of oil
1931 2018-02-23 19:34:46 Paid many millions a year to be a snake oil salesman
1932 2018-02-23 19:34:45 The call invariably goes out for big solutions, more laws, outlaw things that are already illegal. That's security theater, good for airtime, votes, might cost a fortune, doesn't change things. The system is asleep at the wheel.
1933 2018-02-23 19:34:27 Yet they can't drive their fancy cars they don't even know where the engine oil dipstick
1934 2018-02-23 19:34:03 Hate to go on and on about this, but it’s not like if you get a free oil block tomorrow and drop out, you won’t become a billionaire...
1935 2018-02-23 19:33:48 Rebuilding other nations??

That's a funny way of saying bombing the shit out of them for oil 
1936 2018-02-23 19:33:38 i’ll go crazy for some oil down rn 
1937 2018-02-23 19:33:36 Far better stocks than SPE, WCP eg PXT, ERF, GTE (when oil goes up these companies run unlike SPE and WCP which look like dogs)
1938 2018-02-23 19:33:36 Yes, exfoliate and then use Olive oil or coconut oil. They moisturize and nourish really well for me.
1939 2018-02-23 19:33:29 I hope that most of the people who control coal, oil, and gas, are responsible and realize that continuing to burn fossil fuels is detrimental to the future of their children and the future of mankind.
1940 2018-02-23 19:33:23 I agree, his supporters need to try to hold him accountable, for the inflammatory rhetoric that his social media staff has been posting, because shit is getting intense. The US killed hundreds of Russian mercenaries, in Syria, the other day, in a battle for an oil refinery
1941 2018-02-23 19:33:23 Yeah I'm not a fan. They make unusual and risque stuff I guess but not worth the queue at all. Blue Star is soooo good, they have an orange olive oil one that I love!
1942 2018-02-23 19:33:20 where else is he going to keep getting the oil that he sells to a large minority of the American public.
1943 2018-02-23 19:33:19 My pleasure! My personal fave inc. bougie nonsense like: 1 tbsp hemp, chia & flax seeds, 1 tbsp almond butter (I don’t like peanut butter) & coconut oil. Together w/ spinach, almond milk (I don’t eat dairy), frozen berries, 1 lemon, 1 avocado, and whichever nuts I have on hand
1944 2018-02-23 19:33:02 I got an Rx request for fish oil yesterday
1945 2018-02-23 19:33:01 Collapsing #Russian economy: 2017FY Govt deficit: 1.5%GDP (comp to 3.5% in 2016), Central Govt debt 13%GDP (up on 12.4% 2016), External debt 3.5% of GDP (up on 3% of GDP in 2016). Oil reserves funds still >> entire External debt. Forex reserves inc gold $432 bn, up $55bn on 2016.
1946 2018-02-23 19:32:49 I wonder how much of the oil & gas sector invest in your company for their employees? I wonder if oil field employees are #NRA members ? #MAGA

1952 2018-02-23 19:32:24 He is talking inalienable rights which many believe are the rights to all humans granted by God meaning they cannot taken away by man.
1953 2018-02-23 19:32:09 If canada  breaks up, Alberta still is land locked.  Go sell the oil to your good buddies  the USA.  The will screw you morr
1954 2018-02-23 19:32:05 encouraged and supported by a strange coalition made up of western arms sellers represented by states that can no longer survive without creating wars, oil countries, which are afraid of the beginning of their end, from border countries which on one side wish to relive the Glory2
1955 2018-02-23 19:32:01 With the subsidies that the oil industry has recieved, I don't think you can really call them private anymore.
1956 2018-02-23 19:31:59 There's always some substitute oil at hand--Coconut, olive oil and about any unctuos Republican Congressman!
1957 2018-02-23 19:31:42 O yikes, I've tried to do this... in the back garden... In February... Really hard to get oil to keep its heat!! And H&S nightmare....
1958 2018-02-23 19:31:42 This moron is just trying to keep his job a little longer. Friggen idiot, north east BC. Gas and oil and condensate!!!!! And oh yes, for now, good jobs! Oh and pipelines you idiot

1971 2018-02-23 19:29:18 C) If you're willing to look at corollary factors then you'll be forced to conclude that other countries have mass shootings at lower rates despite also having social media and media attention. What's different about us and them besides the media?
1972 2018-02-23 19:29:13 @NaomiAKlein is proud of the oil workers of Venezuela for doing their part in winding down the evil oil industry.
1973 2018-02-23 19:29:01 We just got some new *HONEY OIL CARTS *
1974 2018-02-23 19:29:00 @spomboy @jfostertm Don't worry Russia and Sadi will soon give up trying to keep oil up in the face of US unprecedented exports & we will all be back at $30 thanks to greedy US frackers
1975 2018-02-23 19:28:59 I keep wanting to start using oil paints but the second I start looking up mediums and thinners I feel like dying,,,,, like all u need for watercolors and acrylics is water,,, tell me why I gotta look up the longevity of linseed oil just to paint w oils
1976 2018-02-23 19:28:58 Following the idea of WFPB no oil has resulted in averaging at the very upper limit for fiber consumption when I measured my intake for a few days. Amazing. And those prebiotics helpful for all those probiotics too via homemade kombucha. Easy, delicious, inexpensive, & healthy.

1979 2018-02-23 19:28:17 We are entering the stage where companies that never were associated with them are going to disassociate with them. Happens every time these lefty sponsor boycotts catch fire.
1980 2018-02-23 19:28:09 Longford was a complete car crash, but like all supply overhangs the inventory cleared and now the fact houses cost a lot more to build that they sell for is helping, risk with Longford is oil prices, you've a big exposure with 800kms commute each week.
1981 2018-02-23 19:28:03 Sorry America, but I just washed half of the world's oil supply down the drain.

1983 2018-02-23 19:27:58 You support someone with zero experience and who profits from all the giant oil conglomerates. You are not a “tree hugger”
1984 2018-02-23 19:27:57 man I love deep fried food but it doesn't love me lol. anyone else have the experience where all the oil stays in your esophagus instead of heading to your stomach. worst feeling ever.
1985 2018-02-23 19:27:55 Your reliability has remained stagnant at "pussy" since the 1970s oil crisis.
1986 2018-02-23 19:27:53 Right now the focus is on gun control, not system control, system maintenance, funding, improvement. BTW, the same applies to immigration and healthcare. A combination of process improvement, funding and, in healthcare, cost control(!) would be the thing to do.
1987 2018-02-23 19:27:53 "No oil pipelines from Alberta thru Quebec - we need to save our rivers from pollutants - we need all that clean water capacity to handle the sewage we intend to dump in there!"

1994 2018-02-23 19:26:14 Girly things like I’ve gotten a mug, gym bag, jewelry, hair oil, face masks, Bluetooth speaker, super big scarf, makeup. You can kinda choose what options you’d prefer on some things.
1995 2018-02-23 19:26:13 No. Doesn't have to come to that. It would be sufficient to trigger on warning signs and actually investigate. The problem here is reliance on no correction at all, or a sledgehammer approach hitting the wrong nail, or missing the right one by a wide margin.
1996 2018-02-23 19:26:12 Oil change  tires rotated  lunch with grandpa
1997 2018-02-23 19:26:01 Other bad things to consider for sidetracking from original topic: Putin, voter suppression, lead paint, asbestos, DDT, chlorpyrifos, oil spills, ground-level ozone, polybrominated diplenyl ether, phthalates, tailpipe emissions, & nuclear waste.
1998 2018-02-23 19:25:57 Look. Answer why it's "occurring" so much more now vs decades ago. You know. When guns were more accessible. Almost as if it's not the item and something else. Hmm. How odd.
1999 2018-02-23 19:25:49 Lmao didnt u attempt to cook on snap with all that oil
2000 2018-02-23 19:25:44 I had a 1983 1.6 GL in that colour. Used more oil than petrol. Nice though 
2001 2018-02-23 19:25:19 Ly oil! Lol 
2002 2018-02-23 19:25:10 なんで起きてんだよと
2003 2018-02-23 19:25:07 Not all coastal Alaskans want to work in the oil n gas industry as well as mining. Fish 3 months and be on dole for 9 months seems to be the norm. Not sure how one can address this situation. The person has to want to change industries and want to work all year.

2006 2018-02-23 19:24:56 James, I'm headed your way! I have volunteered to mow the grass to eliminate illegal aliens! My blades are sharpened and I have fresh oil. It may take me several months to arrive, but don't give up on me I'm out to kill the bastards! LOL

2008 2018-02-23 19:24:49 Only oil we use at home. We don't even buy butter.
2009 2018-02-23 19:24:48 yes, try it! you’ll see a difference just in on use. it took the redness out of my skin and the oil/dryness and fixed my tone! i was literally amazed
2010 2018-02-23 19:24:44 #cei is an oil company that i feel like places their oil rigs in dry areas. They will be implementing new oil drills soon! Can't wait!
2011 2018-02-23 19:24:43 Daddy, why are the Americans, who live thousand of miles way from #Syria, stealing #Syrian land and killing their people?

Daddy, now that oil has been found in Dorset (#UK), will the #US steal our land too?

2023 2018-02-23 19:23:18 I'm so happy with how the Sunday Afternoon soaps came out. They should be ready to unmold, cut, and cleaned up later this evening. Sad news though, I'm out of lye and sweet almond oil. Even if I ordered today, it won't arrive until Tuesday or Wednesday.
2024 2018-02-23 19:23:09  my baby brother has offered to buy me the hair oil from @PurpulHair because I need it and he can't be posting pics of his balding sister
2025 2018-02-23 19:23:02 @BreitbartNews It was an Iranian oil tanker that sank, NOT an Iranian oil "rig." Oil rigs drill for the oil & natural gas. Tankers transport the oil & natural gas when no pipeline exists. It's a small detail but worth correcting.

2036 2018-02-23 19:21:39 Throwback to the one student teacher I had in middle school who said “We’re in Iraq for oil and so W can finish daddy’s war,” kinda randomly one day.  Made me feel a lot less crazy about why we were invading Iraq.
2037 2018-02-23 19:21:35 A massive amount of venomous snakes live in D.C's Trump-created Swamp...Trump is America's #1 Snake Oil Salesman.  U know how Trump loves his titles...This is it! He is the most venomous  of all! We must remove these  NOW!
2038 2018-02-23 19:21:14 I think for the gun folk it’s pride at this point. I can’t see anyway that someone couldn’t see the practically self-explanatory connection between guns and gun violence.
2039 2018-02-23 19:21:09 Does Dana Loesch dye her hair with the oil from Wayne LaPierre decaying soul?  It's so black.

2041 2018-02-23 19:21:05  and him doing so without really vetting her at all is just like the GOP not checking the Trump snake oil they were buying

2054 2018-02-23 19:19:43 if the rainforests die, we die. stop eating meat and dairy and fish. stop giving buisness to to companies who use palm oil (starbucks, colgate, etc)
2055 2018-02-23 19:19:38 And it’s British oil, not Scottish.  They shouldn’t be so selfish.
2056 2018-02-23 19:19:10 it's possible at this point they're adding imitation deer antler oil, as we have all become accustomed to the taste and expect it
2057 2018-02-23 19:19:08 I have yet to try CBD oil because I am scared it's gonna fix my stutter and I'll lose MOST of my act
2058 2018-02-23 19:19:03 I had a packet ramen for lunch and I just wanted to let you in on a little secret that I’ve been hoarding for years... however cheap they are (mine was 33 cents, I think), they taste infinitely better with a dash of toasted sesame oil.

2060 2018-02-23 19:18:59 According to a new study by the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis, outdoor recreation generated more than $373.7 billion in 2016, or two percent of the entire U.S. Gross Domestic Product—a contribution larger than oil and mining.
2061 2018-02-23 19:18:57 Trying to fix yourself is about the same as changing your cars oil without tools or oil or hands.
2062 2018-02-23 19:18:52 We are at a time when global demand for oil and gas has never been greater. Why is it that the US has become the number 1 exporter of oil and gas?
2063 2018-02-23 19:18:42 400 components to produce a Samsung mobile phone.....None can be found in Nigeria!!!!!
 Someone is telling Crude oil is the shit....May that shit block ya anus!!!!!!! #WhatHappened
2064 2018-02-23 19:18:36 Everyone who really knew oil thinks Woods is an idiot
2065 2018-02-23 19:18:26 According to a new study by the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis, outdoor recreation generated more than $373.7 billion in 2016, or two percent of the entire U.S. Gross Domestic Product—a contribution larger than oil and mining.
2066 2018-02-23 19:18:11 The United States proposed a list of entities on Friday to be blacklisted under United Nations sanctions on North Korea, a move it says is "aimed at shutting down North Korea's illicit maritime smuggling activities to obtain oil and sell coal."
2067 2018-02-23 19:18:10 Wow!  The many uses of olive oil.  Don't think I'll ever look at olive oil the same way again!  This is such an educational series.  Thanks so much!!
2068 2018-02-23 19:18:07 I'll be the first to say losing Walker made us worse despite the sale price. But this wasn't about winning, it was about money. He's a speed-dependent fullback with a short shelf life. Spurs were never going to pay oil money to him.
2069 2018-02-23 19:17:59 In a very near future #data will be more important than oil 
2070 2018-02-23 19:17:54 The price to get the oil changed in my car was higher today. That’s all your fault Matt Jones. All those time you gloated about never getting yours changed has now cost me more. @KySportsRadio #karma
2071 2018-02-23 19:17:53 I doubt it!
2072 2018-02-23 19:17:51 Laying on the couch watching tv and smoking good weed think I'm might go get some oil nothin else to do
2073 2018-02-23 19:17:48 No oil revenues, No Scotch revenues, Having to pay us for our water and energy, Bankrupt I'd have thought...
2074 2018-02-23 19:17:41 Where can I get a oil/vape pen
2075 2018-02-23 19:17:38 If it's deer antler oil, I totally get it being in there, its great for your health, but I have a feeling they just want you to believe that's what it is
2076 2018-02-23 19:17:28 Isn’t this very unhealthy? When guns are fired they release carcinogens and toxins in the air. I know he wrapped foil around the bacon, but I don’t think it was totally sealed.  Plus, some gun owners oil the outer barrel. Gun oil and toxic seasoning for your bacon. Yum.
2077 2018-02-23 19:17:19 I'll accept your "common sense regulations" from Feinstein/Mom's Demand/etc when pro-choicers accept common sense regs from, say, the Catholic Church. ;)
2078 2018-02-23 19:17:13 I’m really feeling like repentance may be in order for how long I waited to get an oil change
2079 2018-02-23 19:17:12 Sulfate free shampoo, argan oil (on wet hair) , leave-in conditioner. I'm so over the hassle of oil +washing it out. Fuck that shit
2080 2018-02-23 19:17:06 Wasn't there a Russian tanker that got caught delivering oil to North Korea?
2081 2018-02-23 19:16:57 I agree, who wants to be part of Petro that is part of a centralized government of crooks that can't feed its own people.  If you want exposure to oil there are better ways.
2082 2018-02-23 19:16:54 The United States proposed a list of entities on Friday to be blacklisted under United Nations sanctions on North Korea, a move it says is "aimed at shutting down North Korea's illicit maritime smuggling activities to obtain oil and sell coal."
2083 2018-02-23 19:16:44 They could give it all to me and I'll say an incantation for them and maybe throw in a jar of snake oil.
2084 2018-02-23 19:16:31 Wes need to come on so we can go get my oil changed
2085 2018-02-23 19:16:31 Your girl complaints are just like signal lights on a car , baby need a tune up better change ya oil boi 
2086 2018-02-23 19:16:21 #thearchers she's gone .... where? the co-op? MFI? or nipped round to Emma's to have a go?
2087 2018-02-23 19:16:19 Imagine our civilization 100 years in the future. Is it still running on coal and oil? Or are new energies powering far beyond what the old are able to achieve? If the latter, let us make that future now!!
2088 2018-02-23 19:16:16 You can tell tax season, because this dealership is busy! I just want my oil changed and tires rotated!
2089 2018-02-23 19:16:11 من غيرك متسواش
2090 2018-02-23 19:16:08 Our privacy, civil rights (4th amendment? What's that again?) have been eroded significantly since 9/11, we have all kinds of big data to comb through social media, spent boatloads of money, and those who are supposed to keep this from happening, drop the ball. Great.
2091 2018-02-23 19:15:55 I need taste of your lips
2092 2018-02-23 19:15:53 Is that the same oil executive who went bust? The same one evicted from his home in 2015? Who admits to deceiving the receiver and still living in luxury?

Or perhaps there's another and I'm mistaken
2093 2018-02-23 19:15:51 he is good so good to be sold not even for an oil well
2094 2018-02-23 19:15:42 In the early days of MTV would have to be Duran Duran then a few years because of 120 minutes (which i recorded on VHS cus it was on too late) was The Sugarcubes! Around that same time was watching on afternoon & Midnight Oil's Beds Are Burning came on & i was immediately hooked
2095 2018-02-23 19:15:39 Everybody is getting an oil change today
2096 2018-02-23 19:15:22 Stop to get engine oil. Ask the man if its the right one. Man asks me: "Is your car high powered?" Nope.
"Is your engine turbo?" I laughed.
"What year is your car? Er... 2014.
"I'd say I'd have oil more suited for you out the back.
2097 2018-02-23 19:15:19 The best one is when she whisper right besides my ear,,
2098 2018-02-23 19:15:18 Ban drugs. Ban cars. Ban swimming pools. You'll get fewer dead people. "But that's diiiiiiifernt. I don't care about even if saved one more" when it's my thing!"
2099 2018-02-23 19:15:09 Is purple mangosteen an omega 3 fish oil?
2100 2018-02-23 19:15:02 75% of Canada's energy needs come from 'renewables'?
You must be including natural gas, coal and oil in your definition of renewables?
2101 2018-02-23 19:15:00 Vattenfall’s Thomas Stalin said oil is an asset so gearboxes should be filled for life. Copper corrosion still a problem.

2103 2018-02-23 19:14:55 In #ParklandSchoolShooting 's case, we find unprecedented failure in law enforcement and the school system, who managed to ignore, not act upon tip-offs. On top of that, the officer assigned to that school decided to camp out front, do nothing to stop the shooter.
2104 2018-02-23 19:14:50 Is hyaluronic acid considered a hydrant bc I started using that a few wks ago and a produce way less oil. Also, I now remove my makeup with an oil cleanser which seems to be going well.
2105 2018-02-23 19:14:48 the ultimate punchline of ICONOCLASTS is that it is this fantastic symphony of complex characterization orbiting the question of diversity vs authoritarianism with profoundly demonstrative empathy that boils down at the very end to "daddy states are bad" and "no blood for oil".
2106 2018-02-23 19:14:36 I use my pink lotion & baby oil at the same time & out on my body so I smell good soft & a nice shine 
2107 2018-02-23 19:14:30 Lol

2110 2018-02-23 19:14:26 Still doesn’t change the fact that she became a billionaire without a Bsc man! Give some Masters degree holder 5 oil blocs and they might still not be as successful!!
2111 2018-02-23 19:14:19 Got distracted while wok cooking, didn't dry chicken well enough, oil splatters left me with nice scars on forearm.

2113 2018-02-23 19:14:09 Who said it is OK.  Donald Trump is my President and I trust him.

Remember the FDR Oil Sanctions on Japan?  That caused Pearl Harbor?

Why do you want to start WWIII with Russia?

You are not President for good reason and to act like you know something about it is insanity.
2114 2018-02-23 19:14:07 @Arbys you might want to change the oil more often during lent. My potato cakes at lunch tasted like fish patties. Just an fyi.
2115 2018-02-23 19:13:56 나랑 같이 새보지 않으련ㄴ..
2116 2018-02-23 19:13:53 Except you won't. But, hey. Sure thing Mrs. Lovejoy
2117 2018-02-23 19:13:41 1942: WW2 - Japanese submarine I-17 shelled the Ellwood Oil Field near Santa Barbara, Ca, causing little damage ~ first shelling of mainland.
2118 2018-02-23 19:13:40 Ask me in a year..I believe in this ...unless you are selling, who cares about the drop. SS is learning all the time to make this massive.
2119 2018-02-23 19:13:37 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2120 2018-02-23 19:13:33 LOL..looks like they've all had the kool-aid...Stop giving money to these snake oil salespeople....They are all frauds
2121 2018-02-23 19:13:27 In every country that has banned guns or at least very strict control of them school shootings are near enough non-existent. The USA has had 8 this year alone. Do you not see the connection?
2122 2018-02-23 19:13:15 @LeoDiCaprio 22:12 It's Leo. Not sure. More oil drilling - more earthquakes - more volcanoes activity.
2123 2018-02-23 19:13:10 Are you kidding me? Did you even know who this man was before last week?Stop selling snake oil to the people of this country; your adulteress actions speak louder than your “religious” beliefs. You really have to be a fool to believe you.....
2124 2018-02-23 19:13:08 I'll never look at olive oil the same again...#Gyno Lol @ITGirlsStoop @crystalchappell @hillarybsmith "Carbs" Pizza Epi 8..
2125 2018-02-23 19:13:05 Here's what you get from the compromise: fewer dead people.
2126 2018-02-23 19:12:58 ؟؟؟؟؟؟؟
2127 2018-02-23 19:12:53 depends on ur skin type but i have combination/oily skin and i use the neutrogena oil free grapefruit moisturiser! 
2128 2018-02-23 19:12:35 They do want bans. You can be either ignorant about it and act like that's not the case, or be intentionally lying, but that's the facts.
2129 2018-02-23 19:12:31 Buy crude oil at 62.60 stop close below 62.30 target 65.40
2130 2018-02-23 19:12:28 It pretty much an oil based moisturizer
2131 2018-02-23 19:12:28 You could do it with pepper infused oil
2132 2018-02-23 19:12:18 Sorry, no. Each and every time after a shooting there was a push towards restrictions, including confiscation, while in most cases the system failed, i.e. previoius convictions not making it into NICS, so that a felon was able to purchase something he wasn't allowed to.

2134 2018-02-23 19:11:49 Ah. So you're one of those. Sorry. But compromise implies we get something. The call has always been for gun owners to give more. It's death by a thousand cuts essentially. No more "compromise."
2135 2018-02-23 19:11:44 خلطت بين العلاقة الثنائية مع روسيا وعلاقة روسيا باتفاق اوبك واحتمالات انسحابها منه. راجع التغريدات حفظك الله
2136 2018-02-23 19:11:44 How can a suspect reject an x-ray? Shove a dose of castor oil down a funnel into him. He's allegedly broken the law so bang go his human rights. I'm sure he doesn't give a damm if the drugs kill others.
2137 2018-02-23 19:11:43 Smh by the time we get a new tire, the oil changed, and his haircut it'll be close to 6pm
2138 2018-02-23 19:11:30 Would be 'deliberation mediate paid to keep carrie Fish oil is can dreams'
2139 2018-02-23 19:11:28 He gauges it by the number of hate groups acting out! The oil being opened up across our nation and the Article! The number of hotels he is opening across the world. The number of citizens he has evicted. Get it !
2140 2018-02-23 19:11:21 Interesting... I'm not sure I'd be happy with a (conservative) 38% drop in my holding, but each to their own #UKOG
2141 2018-02-23 19:11:14 Wear a hematite amulet to sleep tonight. It's as good for you as oil pulling without taking the extra time.
2142 2018-02-23 19:11:09 夜中にお菓子食べたりしてたせいですでにお腹周りと顔にお肉が…
2143 2018-02-23 19:11:08 Send our raw sewage to the protesters backyard......oh can we please...necessary maintenance on our oil wells (and on our Happiness)!
2144 2018-02-23 19:10:40 Like oil and water. Purdy!

2147 2018-02-23 19:09:53 Do you think current US oil production is too high?  #AskBoone
2148 2018-02-23 19:09:40 Republicans and Trump made a huge promise to wealthy donors to repay them for campaign contributions with huge tax cuts. Hence GOPTAXSCAM. Corker will make millions and Collins learned McConnell is a man of his word. Murkowski got oil wells
2149 2018-02-23 19:09:04 Are you kidding? That was ratings gold for @cnn.
2150 2018-02-23 19:08:44 MSM ALWAYS needs a simplistic (usually very inaccurate) reason for moves in oil mkts. CNBC and clueless @jackiedeangelis along with most other outlets, always need a reason for a move. They never dig any further then what a previously positioned trader feeds them off camera.
2151 2018-02-23 19:08:24 I just ordered ANOTHER bottle of the @MEnaturals golden glow body oil.

This time I had to strong arm her into selling me a 8oz instead or a 4oz because I ran clear through that 4 oz

It's the best body oil I've ever used on my skin.
Available scented and unscented...
2152 2018-02-23 19:08:23 Working on #Ephesians 1:17-18-19 for #HarpandBowl Sunday - so many cross references! I though I had done this passage so many times before and thought ‘what oil can I squeeze out of it!’ It’s #Oily!!! So much in that passage!!!!!!
2153 2018-02-23 19:07:47 11. How an oil might be the cure.
2154 2018-02-23 19:07:40 Always works . Enjoy burning the midnight oil.
2155 2018-02-23 19:07:40 Shea moisture jamaican black oil deep conditioner and leave in. Really the whole line
2156 2018-02-23 19:07:36 Do you think the #Oilers have a chaperone for #PeterChiarelli at the #TradeDeadline? Maybe a guy with a taser that knocks #Chiarelli unconscious so he doesn't trade #ConnorMcDavid for #NickBonino or #RileyNash? #Oil #DeadlineDayIsComing #Help #FallinForDahlin
2157 2018-02-23 19:07:36 What has oil done is the question .  My thighs
2158 2018-02-23 19:07:33 I called 3 places in Elkhart to change my oil and they’re either full or closed and my mf oil light is on sos
2159 2018-02-23 19:07:28 And of course now after getting an oil change there’s 1,001 other things wrong with my car. 
2160 2018-02-23 19:07:23 It’s actually coconut oil hehe <3:) follow my blog for more health tips!
2161 2018-02-23 19:07:21 A few seconds of blabbering, then right back to hocking snake oil to rubs.
2162 2018-02-23 19:07:19 #thearchers   Who needs a medical degree, I think most of twitter predicted this #poornic
2163 2018-02-23 19:07:15 Eggs, flower, salt, olive oil and baking powder

2165 2018-02-23 19:07:09 India seeks reasonable oil price from Saudi Arabia. Last year Iraq was the top oil supplier to india . Why don't we utilize our hydrocarbon deposits in north east ? @dpradhanbjp @PMOIndia
2166 2018-02-23 19:07:04 The vegan cookies still show up as out of stock for me. If I e-mail you is it possible for you to guide me on how to use the olive oil? 
2167 2018-02-23 19:06:57 Okay, Olive Oil and White Bread is being downloaded now!
2168 2018-02-23 19:06:51 Here are some Pro Mod shots from Q1 of the RPM Pro Mod Winter Warm-Up & NHRA Lucas Oil Racing Series here at OSW. 
Qualifying sheet included
2169 2018-02-23 19:06:44 Titan loves his HempWorx CBD oil dog treats! He thinks they're his cookies! Mom loves they are grain, soy, corn, wheat and sugar free!  
2170 2018-02-23 19:06:32 motor oil isnt for drinking
2171 2018-02-23 19:06:28 It was a bit Far East for me. Thought I would need to speak Dutch if I went any further. Looking at a waste oil heater for a friend next door to ovenden.
2172 2018-02-23 19:06:22 Great idea! We could take Quebec's raw sewage and use it for fracking. Win win. Then we'll sell them our oil with a huge environmental fee.
2173 2018-02-23 19:06:11 Hot coconut oil is the best.  Super slippery. Smells nice. Leaves skin supple. Tastes nice on certain body parts. Ok. All. All natural. It'll be tge only Virgin in the room. Love giving massages. We can do the rest tomorrow.
2174 2018-02-23 19:06:02 Yes steal a picture from your wallet would you still trust yourself to sleep on your bed for the witch to know that you've moved to enter your room again to go into your room to steal your picture from your wallet and  put her obeah  oil on your belongings?
2175 2018-02-23 19:05:57 So you’re saying “what’s the point in saving hundreds of children’s lives if we can’t save them all”?
2176 2018-02-23 19:05:49 The oil in Turkana can never turn into another Niger. It's to little. If we extract it at the same rate as Saudi Arabia it will be depleted in 52 days!
2177 2018-02-23 19:05:48 If playing Iso ball with no defense is art, it's a motel oil painting, not a Rembrandt.
2178 2018-02-23 19:05:37 Had my first progesterone in oil shot today. I put lidocaine cream on the area about 10 min before the injection and iced for about a minute. Not as bad as I thought. #IVF
2179 2018-02-23 19:05:18 Because they're so environmentally enlightened.  Except when it comes to importing Saudi oil and sewage disposal.  True Canadians.
2180 2018-02-23 19:05:09 Interior like those oil pipelines?
2181 2018-02-23 19:05:04 @MetLife - I am calling for a certain Oil & Gas company to drop your benefits that they chose to provide in their company insurance package. Very bad choice. #MAGA
2182 2018-02-23 19:04:54 Newsflash: Russia & China are still sending them coal, oil, and food. Just a heads up !!
2183 2018-02-23 19:04:47 Oil and water can sit in the same container for a very long time and never mix
2184 2018-02-23 19:04:44 “mi need some h’olive oil”  - @IAMDJLIVE 

jamaicans really be adding an “h” to words that don’t begin with the letter “h”
2185 2018-02-23 19:04:41 Yes! Yes! I like that whole process and that's why I end up re-reading the beginning. Olive Oil and White Bread is also about a long-term relationship so that's why I end up interested in the beginning.
2186 2018-02-23 19:04:36 Rekt!  wp man! And what a coincidence btw, I chose rogue for the brawl today too and won a few runs with classic oil combo 
2187 2018-02-23 19:04:35 vape oil. Please I must see
2188 2018-02-23 19:04:18 Trump's solution is throwing more guns! It is like throwing oil at a raging fire just to try to stop it. The only solution is strick gun laws and thorough background check.... Most importantly get rid of all the firearms....
2189 2018-02-23 19:03:53 Juve go still win am last last
2190 2018-02-23 19:03:39 If I chose to sleep on the floor because a witch that lives I  your own house enter your room because she listen to your every movements when you are on your bed then when you go to the bath she quickly enter your roo. And put her obeah oil on your napsack and steal a picture
2191 2018-02-23 19:03:30 Walking home from dropping off my car to get an oil change and my tires rotated, so far I have witnessed two car accidents and a group of homeless gentlemen fighting over socks
2192 2018-02-23 19:03:25 Lmao what Will oil do??
2193 2018-02-23 19:03:21 Oh please Scalise. That amounts to a measly $20 more per week!! Higher INTEREST RATES (directly caused by DEFICIT financed tax cuts) and higher GAS/Oil Prices 
EAT UP those GAINS and more
Spare us the LIE it helped Middle Class when your mega rich DONORS get 80+% of the benefits

2200 2018-02-23 19:02:20 Jasmine oil is my favorite. It’s not as obnoxious as Eucalyptus and just helps me zen. I also like Bergamont but that’s mainly while I’m already working and just need to focus without getting sidetracked.
2201 2018-02-23 19:02:14 I should really get my oil changed today but I’m too lazy. #Storyofmylife

2209 2018-02-23 19:01:27 And the worst part? The US is the net beneficiary. Get our oil for cheap. Sell theirs for top dollar. Then, when all oil is gone, we are in their back pocket. And we will not have a choice about them taking our oil. . . These folks are actively working against Canada

2213 2018-02-23 19:01:19 Surely one of these wonderful so called “entrepreneurs” we are always hearing about could invest in a Palm oil substitute manufacturing facility to re-employ those Brazilians currently engaged in felling the trees. I a little idealistic? Yes.....but food for thought?

2220 2018-02-23 19:00:55 It's because of the oil issue. Audis are terrible at oil consumption and once the car runs out of oil; all pistons and valves will be gone and that will be the end of your car!!@audisouthafrica is crap

2337 2018-02-23 18:47:34 Mis primeras prácticas fueron en Mobil Oil, tenían políticas y lineamientos que venían de USA. Una de ellas era: "We want to keep you. Si estás leyendo esto es porque queremos que te quedes aquí". 
Todos los practicantes ganábamos 20% más que la RMV.
Obvio, duré años allí.

2348 2018-02-23 18:46:33 Lol like idk. Was told by one person I’ve normal skin. Think it leans to dehydrated though. Used to think dry but it clings to shine so I’m assuming there’s enough oil in.

2351 2018-02-23 18:45:56 True. It also needs an industry that wants to deploy private capital just like solar and wind . Coal industry is not interested. Oil and Gas: No. Power plant developers: Possibly. Others?
2352 2018-02-23 18:45:51 U.S. Oil Rig Count Rises by 1 to 799, Baker Hughes Says. The fifth straight weekly increase.

2371 2018-02-23 18:43:58 We were told the fries are cooked in the same oil as the bacon at your cannon location. Just wondering if the fries are vegan at the Locke location then? Thanks so much!
2372 2018-02-23 18:43:57 NO NO NO fuck off you oil merchants
2373 2018-02-23 18:43:51 1. Trees are made of air, not dirt.  2. Oil is made of plants, not dinosaurs.

2374 2018-02-23 18:43:47 But something tells me you're okay with oil and gas money, insurance money and Wall Street cash.

2377 2018-02-23 18:43:28 Argan Oil is my favorite. Sweet smell. Really lightweight. A little goes a long way. I only recommend this for your hair. I’m not a fan of putting oils on your skin. It can clog your pores.

2379 2018-02-23 18:43:18 This seems like US trying to prevent being cut out of a SK deal direct with NK. I think that's what the Samsung tariffs were about. If China gives oil to NK, we aren't going to end trade with them. Trump staked him presidency on the economy! #Bluffing
2380 2018-02-23 18:43:12 I used materials economically. I could buy tar at hardware stores and didn’t need to build a huge supply of oil paints. I figured: paint, tar, it’s all manufactured anyways. I like the strength of the material. Pushing it is a wonderful feeling.

2383 2018-02-23 18:43:04 Oil analysts are beginning to piece together the impacts that EVs+AVs will have. But as they haven't fully explored the AV business models they have underestimated how much AVs will leverage the intro of EVs. Expect forecast oil demand to drop each yr from now as the penny drops.

2386 2018-02-23 18:42:59 The oil pipelines are such a depressing reminder that when the powers that be want something badly enough, it seriously doesn't matter one iota how many of us protest, or how much.
2387 2018-02-23 18:42:18 looks like oil and gas companies getting ready to take off but we'll see
everything else related to consumer is spending last three days going down, if gas gets going look out, load op on oil plays and short rest of market

maybe why utilities went off today
2388 2018-02-23 18:42:15 Yep, meanwhile the Bakken keeps churning out 1.2 million barrels oil per day.....some of which is now being exported to Europe and India. Not to mention the 2 billion cf of LNG per day.....most of which is exported. Trudeau is killing CA.
2389 2018-02-23 18:42:13 I use an oil moisturizer at night... I love it. It didn't soak in quickly enough in the mornings, though. But I've tried chapstick, lip masks, layering with gloss, thin coats... It all still pills.
2390 2018-02-23 18:41:57 Switching to non-foaming cleanser and not being afraid of using both moisturizer and oil together (used to just use oil) yes - minimal breakouts, foundation lasts longer
2391 2018-02-23 18:41:55 I (used) to have a lip balm that contained arachis oil, not knowing it was peanut..ugh!
2392 2018-02-23 18:41:48 Why you want an assault weapon ban??? So we can't defend ourselves against a government that blew up 3,000 citizens on Sept 11, 2001 just to go kill millions more in the Middle East for Oil, Opiods, and other resources???

2397 2018-02-23 18:41:18 Interesting bit: 'One of the oil industry’s biggest fears regarding climate change is regulation. It is of such importance that BP recently hinted at big oil’s exodus from the EU if climate regulation took effect.'  Hmm. And if #brexit what lies in store?
2398 2018-02-23 18:41:09 Oil? Oil. So much for those sanctions and whatnot.
2399 2018-02-23 18:41:06 If I had a dollar for everytime I said “oh crap I need to get my oil changed” I’d prob make enough money to get my oil changed

2402 2018-02-23 18:40:48 flaxseed oil is quite sensitive to light so I could see why they can't use it...

but I'm sure there's alternatives to using fish oil out there, clearly they're using fish just cus it's cheap or something

2420 2018-02-23 18:38:50 Britain government are evil beast,brexit from EU,eh!but find it inhuman to have Biafrans from Nigeria,their murderous machine to suck the blood of Biafrans for their oil,their cup of abominable is full and the pay day is here, Referendum! Biafrans now!
2421 2018-02-23 18:38:49 Yes! My mom has noted that you can also do this in the oven and thus avoid a lot of the oil! You just coat the cauliflower and potatoes in the spices and put them on a baking sheet.
2422 2018-02-23 18:38:49 Coconut oil and butter are more expensive than vegetable oils and almost flour costs more than white flour. So the extra cost is justified to do things the right way.
2423 2018-02-23 18:38:46 If we need guns to resist a tyrannical government, where were the guns during the Suffrage and Civil Rights eras? Where have they been, while black and LGBTQ bodies are disproportionately murdered? While we war over oil & drugs? While ICE comes for our neighbors?

2430 2018-02-23 18:37:57 The day will come, very soon where Turkey, Iran and Russia will go against Israel. They will use the Border lines as the issue, but they want Israel's oil and natural gas. Israel's only defense will have to be nuclear. There won't be any other  nation willing to Fight Putin.

2444 2018-02-23 18:35:14 Do you know the railway was only commissioned by the said PMB? GEJ had paid the contractors and the work had begun long before he left power. Do you also know that the PMB team stood against removal of oil subsidy which was effected during his tenure?
2445 2018-02-23 18:35:13 Sadly, Trudope, Climate Barbie and Herr Butts will not be happy until no oil can be exported from Canada.  We could add trillions to our treasury if we had a plan for our resource industry.  Sadly the LPC plan is to strangle it.

2467 2018-02-23 18:32:59 I'm finally getting my oil change and my mechanic is going to punch me. I'm so overdue.
2468 2018-02-23 18:32:55 *starts grocery trip with 6 things on my list*

*leaves store with a year’s worth of food plus a grater and a pair of tongs and a casserole dish and a new oil container plus 10 other things i don’t really need*
2469 2018-02-23 18:32:42 But seriously I don’t want to listen to your SPEAKERPHONE financial planning meeting for your new essential oil business Sally. I want to enjoy my broccoli cheddar.
2470 2018-02-23 18:32:35 so the verdict is almond oil.
2471 2018-02-23 18:32:32 Hi Matt - This is some oil separating from the sauce. Please email us at wecare@conagra.com & we'll get some further details to share with our team. Thx!
2472 2018-02-23 18:32:10 So far at work today I’ve gotten paid to sit and wait 1.5 hours for an oil change, sit at my desk and do nothing and pick up lunch

2475 2018-02-23 18:31:57 Then it spilled thousands of gallons of oil everywhere.  Never the entire story with that guy.

#2 He's a carpet bagger, didnt even live in the District until what, last year?

2486 2018-02-23 18:30:42 It would be a shame if oil platforms were too expensive to operate due to random harassment of committed citizens on boats and in front of trains and trucks, who care about the future and protecting their coast from needless massive oil spill catastrophes.
2487 2018-02-23 18:30:39 Got fully stocked diapers, wipes, laundry soap, and now an oil change and clean car. 

I'd say I'm doing just fine at adulting.

2492 2018-02-23 18:30:07 So I used all my free oil changes at my dealership and he came and told me that it’ll be $72 and of course I said that’s fine but really I’m fucking hating myself for paying $72 for an oil change...

2495 2018-02-23 18:29:41 what went wrong with Venezuela if it actually does have such large oil reserves?İs it politics,economics or a vaccum brought on by lack of information or education by a largely illiterate society?And that last matter is not only Venezuela
2496 2018-02-23 18:29:36 We use oil. They use lotion. 
2497 2018-02-23 18:29:08 I absolutely hate getting oil changes

2501 2018-02-23 18:28:27 Nor do we need this oil. There's a glut of oil now (and plenty of natural gas, too) and the price of gas is $3.50 a gallon or more in places.  CONTINUE moving to wind and solar and thorium and storage technologies; USA take the lead. 
Future markets > temporary gluts of oil
2502 2018-02-23 18:28:14 But as we all truly know, the Oil issue this yr is speed of puck movement, decisions, clean passes more than ft speed.  Luc, Let, Strome only guys I’d call slow.

2511 2018-02-23 18:27:07 PREDIMED contradicts your claim that low fat is healthier. The trial showed that a Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts or olive oil (which increased fat intake) compared to a low fat diet, decreased major CVD events and death
2512 2018-02-23 18:26:26 Bet he’s no oil painting
2513 2018-02-23 18:26:19 2/ same with the FIRS agency, it was remitting  about 5trillion to the previous govt anually, when oil was over a $100 per barrel, and still about the same value remitted to the present one with oil at $38 per barrel. This couldnt b achieved without uprooting the corruptn there

2531 2018-02-23 18:24:28 You've hitched yourself to a snake oil salesman, a con artist. Was he making America great when he defrauded students with his university for which he paid $25 million? Or when he would force contractors to take him to court to get paid? He's still that same person.
2532 2018-02-23 18:24:24 Put some cold pressed olive oil into the hot skillet. I did about 3 minutes or so on each side. It rose fairly quickly and had a nice golden crust almost instantly.
2533 2018-02-23 18:24:23 What about cod liver oil/fermented cod liver oil?
2534 2018-02-23 18:24:11 Had to come Get an oil change during my break. I’d rather be napping

2540 2018-02-23 18:23:07 In my view, EVs hit about 100M in 2025 with 26% market, and oil peaks around that time. So BP looks like the most adequate projection around 2025.

Seizure of natural gas & oil & destruction of christian population by the inner circle running U.S & west -for its private concerns.
2546 2018-02-23 18:22:38 Anyway... Why would you restrict a company name to content publishing when your product is capable of much more than that?
2547 2018-02-23 18:22:31 And that's why I said heavy cooking or cooking everything shouldn't be encouraged, bc you cook all your food and possibly over cook it and then use hella oil and then add salt to it. Explain to me what is healthy about that? There's no nutritional content in your veggies then.
2548 2018-02-23 18:22:27 Which brush are you using for your blocking in? Oil Lush? Looks great, btw. I can't believe you do this all on one layer. That would terrify me. haha
2549 2018-02-23 18:22:19 Jeeez. Those poor people. Is anybody getting food, fuel to them?  
I remember this up in NW IA where I grew up centuries ago. 
If you didn't have enough fuel oil, you were screwed dead. 
And at that time the driver of the oil truck could refuse you fuel if you hadn't paid bill.
2550 2018-02-23 18:22:02 You mean that snake oil salesmen who used to steal old people's money, and for years said he was dying and all he needed was millions to live and if you donated then you were let into heaven... In God we trust means give me money... Thanks Billy Graham rot in piss

2583 2018-02-23 18:16:16 This tweet made me laugh so hard. You DO realize it was conservatives who completely mismanaged our oil wealth over the past four decades, right? That's why we're broke now, not because of the last three years...
2584 2018-02-23 18:16:16 The human body can’t tell the distance anyways. You won’t be able to dodge either
2585 2018-02-23 18:16:10 Same '03.  By '07-'08 Russian men were starting to become downright arrogant about their self-confidence.  $140/barrel oil will do that to a society and a leader.  And then the worldwide financial crisis and oil shock.  Oops - not so great as you thought.

2597 2018-02-23 18:15:00 Can’t help thinking of the soldiers vaccinated before they went to the Gulf War and the refusal to tell them later which vaccinations were given, so still unclear whether GWI due to vaccinations, burning oil vapour or etc. Outrageous that this happened to NHS staff.
2598 2018-02-23 18:14:57 Some folks that swallowed the oil running out lie must be feeling they have been had.

2610 2018-02-23 18:13:05 Yeah but it's almost impossible to reach people like that. All the grunts at my gym speaking off about how notley destroyed the economy. No, low oil prices destroyed the economy. How can you not get that?
2611 2018-02-23 18:13:05 If you believe a small handful of huge companies operating on the scale of oil companies can't make an informal, unspoken agreement to collude in keeping profits and prices high, you don't know anything about cartels or quasi-monopoly profits.
2612 2018-02-23 18:12:58 I couldn't eat that stuff.  I live in a city with a fishing history, aye real fish (not any more because of North Sea Oil).  I know, boring.  But crustaceans are from the West Coast, and seriously disgusting.
2613 2018-02-23 18:12:50 Impressed, it was all I could do to remember to add oil the damper pots.  
2614 2018-02-23 18:12:41 S/O to my local fragrance oil man lol !
2615 2018-02-23 18:12:40 Fossil fuel industry killed nuclear politically back in the 70's. We can build much safer reactors now and we should. Screw big oil & natgas
2616 2018-02-23 18:12:37 Do your ears have a beard? No? Then why is oil in your ears? Lol
2617 2018-02-23 18:12:36 I am switching all my rentals over to @Avis from @enterprisecares.  I imagine Avis will pick up a lot of business from all this.
2618 2018-02-23 18:12:35 Consentido is one of my preferred olive oil. Good choice. You should also try Castillo de Canena
2619 2018-02-23 18:12:32 eeekk. Synthetic oil a muthafucka
2620 2018-02-23 18:12:30 By keeping our oil in the ground we will become the greatest post national state ever envisioned when everyone else runs out of oil... ya lets see how that works out for us...
2621 2018-02-23 18:12:06 اللهم امين
2622 2018-02-23 18:12:04 Why must oil changes be so damn expensive 
2623 2018-02-23 18:12:03 I feel like Ross from that 1 episode in friends where he gets stuck in leather pants and then gets baby powder & oil on him while on a date
2624 2018-02-23 18:11:50 Gun control and safety legislation is detrimental to their industry. I think of it like when oil and mining companies come up with safety rules for their own industry.  None of them are going to do the right thing on their own -- it goes against their bottom line. Profits.
2625 2018-02-23 18:11:47 I’m gonna go with a 90s-era “black oil” X-Files reference for this one. Also… 
2626 2018-02-23 18:11:47 I always strike oil.

2632 2018-02-23 18:10:52 I swear no bullshit on this. You can smoke oil/wax out of a meth pipe.

2635 2018-02-23 18:10:49 Oil change? Tire rotation? Tune-up? Whatever.....
2636 2018-02-23 18:10:49 Honestly here in Alberta if it wasn’t for public sector hiring we’d be in a depression of sorts. It’s scary how dependent our economy has gotten on it. Before it was oil dependence and now it’s taxpayer funded govt job dependence.

2656 2018-02-23 18:08:50 If you have oily skin it’ll be making it worse! The ingredients will dry skin, your body will over compensate and produce more oil. Ditch them and start with an oil or balm & I promise it’ll help.

2674 2018-02-23 18:06:16 I can’t use oil or a balm on my eyes. They’re too sensitive. I’ve tried everything, and there’s nothing that doesn’t cause puffy, streaming eyes :(

2683 2018-02-23 18:05:25 do you use a specific brand ?? (for the rose hip oil)
2684 2018-02-23 18:05:13  Wonder how toxic gun oil is? No brain cells there to kill anyways.
2685 2018-02-23 18:05:05 Company names should be meaningful for customers. If Satoshi Pay is a micro-pay solution for publishers, then something to do with “money”, “content” and “publishing” would be better. Currently, it’s too focused on the tech and not enough on the value proposition.
2686 2018-02-23 18:04:54 That argan oil gotta be Moroccan though No?
2687 2018-02-23 18:04:37 I know many teachers for whom carrying a gun would be too stressful. Not everyone is cut out for that. I’m 100% 2nd Amendment and I don’t own a gun. I don’t want one. That might change some day. I think armed security is better idea. Let the teachers focus on educating.

2689 2018-02-23 18:04:26 If you mean cannabis oil, like coconut oil based cannabis extractions, do not vape this. Cannabis concentrates, as in the concentrated forms of trichomes (the resin heads that hold THC, CBD, terpenes, etc), are vaproized.
2690 2018-02-23 18:04:25 Exactly my thought. I don’t expect the Oil to be better next year. I have zero confidence in their talent assessment. What is a prospect??? Their record is atrocious and the key idiot Green is still involved.
2691 2018-02-23 18:04:21 Do we need to take fish oil daily? How many IOU?
2692 2018-02-23 18:04:13 You eat it. We have seen APC ALL. Don't forget the price of oil is now rising ho. What is now the New "EXCUSS". At least with 3yrs OBJ
2693 2018-02-23 18:04:12 You’re using the wrong cleanser! You need an oil or balm and it’ll take everything off in seconds. Promise.

2702 2018-02-23 18:03:19 Well, AB does not control the price of oil. So, this is better than having both, private and public employment down as would have been the case with austerity policies.  Or do you think that not hiring nurses will increase jobs in the private sector?

2747 2018-02-23 17:59:16 Trump is nothing but a venomous snake oil salesman.
2748 2018-02-23 17:58:58 Olive oil, usually. We're a superstitious lost, most of us, and strange/stray cats are not exactly welcome.

2753 2018-02-23 17:58:35 It’s called experience thru practice. If he has gun at school should be on his person. Called conceal carry
2754 2018-02-23 17:58:30 Hoe do we solve it? Don't know. The right wing media centers around promoting disinformation. Look what they've done to scientific credibility, in order to deny climate change to continue with oil and coal.
2755 2018-02-23 17:58:28 ...says the snake-oil-saleswummin who doesn't do minutes of important meetings to do with Scotland's future..and the fact that all your ministers are useless at their jobs beggars belief.

2757 2018-02-23 17:58:21 Gang bangers, no matter what their age, usually don't own guns they obtained legally. Street savvy thugs know where to get guns. Criminals  black marketillegal guns. No law is going to change that.

2763 2018-02-23 17:57:38 I lost my father to prostate cancer, I'm glad you were able to have yours removed. I'd strongly recommend taking CBD oil to aid your recovery and study the endocannabinoid system of the body. Best wishes.
2764 2018-02-23 17:57:20 Trump is nothing but a snake oil salesman and coward to Putin and the NRA.
2765 2018-02-23 17:57:12 Technically yes, but only in oil form, and nobody sells it that way, so de facto no.

2770 2018-02-23 17:56:38 My car is paid off and I just found out my free oil changes and tire rotations are good until 2025. Needless to say I'm a happy girl
2771 2018-02-23 17:56:38 Indonesia doesn't recognize oil that's called Olive oil as we are only famous for using the Palm oil :-p And my arms gone kekar has got nothing to do with the gym but getting used to menguleg :))
2772 2018-02-23 17:56:28 Not necessarily. Much ethylene will come from ethane which is from natural gas, LNGs and condensate rather than naphtha from shale oil. A lot of Propylene comes from off gas from catalytic crackers which are heavy oil.
2773 2018-02-23 17:56:20 Good idea trump $.25 increase on gas will pay for the wall we have so much oil Who cares

I would assume the hype of digital has reached a plateau and many have realised that it's not the replacement as was thought in the early 00's. Film and Digital have their place, I've said before like Oil and Acrylic paintings.

2780 2018-02-23 17:56:08 Indalo freno la producción de Oil en San Lorenzo y 400 empleos penden de un hilo
2781 2018-02-23 17:56:06 Limiting production to keep oil prices in check is different from canceling multimillion dollar exploration and development projects based on the security situation.
2782 2018-02-23 17:56:02 Nichols brings up a point...that we hire too many Leftist teachers who aren't interested in protecting kids in any meaningful way. I don't see most teachers going along with this idea...they're mostly, anti gun anti self-defense.
2783 2018-02-23 17:55:55 if there’s anything in this world that i hate its getting my oil changed. it takes FOREVER
2784 2018-02-23 17:55:53 Yeh ... Rigs are so connected to the oil comp office now that brains aren't required onsite! Computers have changed it so totally.
2785 2018-02-23 17:55:50 Bye Felicia
2786 2018-02-23 17:55:43 Cooking oil =fish oil
2787 2018-02-23 17:55:36 It'd make more sense if it had random effects.  Some boost your health, others deplete stamina, make your vision blurry, lower run speed, etc.  Like if you were deal with a snake oil salesman.
2788 2018-02-23 17:55:32 If you’re still conflicted over the washing vs wiping yer margarine tub, you could always buy butter - it’s better for you than the tub of palm oil anyway #bbcpm
2789 2018-02-23 17:55:29 Jeremy.  Thanks for sharing.  Is there a good source on how much installed wind and solar will be required to replace our current fossil fuel energy sources?  Not just electricity but all the oil/gas that powers our transportation systems and heats most of our homes.

2794 2018-02-23 17:55:23 @bulletproofexec hey Dave if you have a moment could you speak on the effects of oil over time as I have adopted much of the bp life but worry about the overall oil intake
2795 2018-02-23 17:55:22 Poetry - apparently you have snowed enough people before they took you in - truth is the snake took the woman in by deceit & promises the way a grifter usually operates . . . snake oil salesman use to come in a wagon, now they use the ballot box . . .
2796 2018-02-23 17:55:00 Yet it stands for gold oil and drugs!! Keep deleting it I’ll keep posting it scum bags
2797 2018-02-23 17:54:51 Compared to big oil or planned parenthood? They dwarf it. Casino lobbies also.
2798 2018-02-23 17:54:41 It’s not politicizing sports, this is promoting inclusivity. Hockey is a sport where many kids out there don’t see it as an option because the vast majority of players are upper/middle class white boys. Not about politics, about welcoming everyone to our sport, good for the game.

2805 2018-02-23 17:54:21 @RyanZinke  Do u not care if the Earth survives for future generations or is $ good enough from oil & gas companies 2 make u turn a blind eye 2 their actions, Flaring wastes $, pollutes the air & the constant leaks destroy habitats & water supplies, yet U want fewer regulations?
2806 2018-02-23 17:54:16 ah that's great cos my gig buddy for those sorts of things moved to Berlin (obviously). im now so ensconced in being a beardo I've started making my own oil blends
2807 2018-02-23 17:54:15 Which will be roughly 15 months of tax for oil supplied through the pipeline from Forties. Remember Trade gap increased by £3billion for the month this pipeline was shut down.

The rest of the oil taxes from the other fields. can be used to bolster the economy in the short term.
2808 2018-02-23 17:54:10 There isn't much profit in just an oil change but there is in repairs.
2809 2018-02-23 17:53:58 Come for an oil change, stay for $500 worth of truck maintainence.
2810 2018-02-23 17:53:55 Do U think the former dependence of US on Arab oil was good?
2811 2018-02-23 17:53:51 The economic growth through my term has been slowing down, with this increase in the development of the oil industry, I think we are going to turn that around.
2812 2018-02-23 17:53:50 Shouldn’t you be back at the motor pool changing oil?
2813 2018-02-23 17:53:18 How ironic
2814 2018-02-23 17:53:16 I can never manage to clean oil bottles out properly because of that plastic pourer thing wedged in the top. Get rid of it, save on plastic, I can free pour it as I like and wash it out #bbcpm
2815 2018-02-23 17:52:49 Aah! There's such a thing? And what's that oil made of?
2816 2018-02-23 17:52:46 If it's any consolation; ted's gun bacon likely tastes like shit and is probably toxic if consumed regularly.

The barrel finish on most AR15s is parkerizing, a great finish! ...  Because it soaks up oil; and leeches it back out.

Personal experience gun oil tastes like cancer :)

2825 2018-02-23 17:52:13 Noooooooooooooooo. Stop stop! They’re full of drying ingredients; skip and just use a great oil or balm!
2826 2018-02-23 17:51:35 Yep, they’re mostly full of alcohol which dries and irritates skin. Micellar is better and will remove mascara, but tbh get in there straight away with a great balm or oil and get rid of it all in seconds.

2831 2018-02-23 17:50:52 Massage your scalp with virgin coconut oil for like 15 mins every other day, that will help your hair grow fast and them split ends. Wash your hair after but If you leave it over night it’s better.
2832 2018-02-23 17:50:49 Obv... heat up some beef or chicken stock/broth. Get a loaf of French bread/ baguette and dunk it in it like bread dipping oil. And was it down with an Gatorade/ Powerade... fever will break in two hours or so. Works every time for me
2833 2018-02-23 17:50:43 I lived in Dundee recently. I have freinds and family in oil. The industry is on its arse. Lots of redundancies and Aberdeen house prices are dropping. This is not a booming industry

2882 2018-02-23 17:43:49 I got castor bean oil for trying to make my own pen thread sealant (the other ingredient being pine gum rosin), but it's also good on the skin.
2883 2018-02-23 17:43:48 I’m only 20 minutes up the road. Oil change for a homemade apple pie?

2887 2018-02-23 17:43:22 Some corrections:
UK re-elected the Tories;
Trident renewal supported by UK majority;
Limited UK involvement in Syria;
Nobody ever said oil wealth was a bad thing;
The Vow was delivered in full;
UK national debt grew following global crisis;
UK voted to leave the EU.

2895 2018-02-23 17:42:55 I’ve saved $100s of dollars on coffee already this year! Instead of buying coffee, I get a basic oil change on my Honda Civic every morning and just drink the free coffee provided at @jiffylube

2904 2018-02-23 17:41:47 no but when he works for a despot regime that employs slave labour and uses oil money to repress freedom of expression for others it does come off as a tad hypocritical
2905 2018-02-23 17:41:44 Before applying makeup, use a primer or base. It'll help prevent oil production &amp; keep your skin &amp; makeup looking fresh for hours!
2906 2018-02-23 17:41:42 I think they were adverts for motor oil that came in different forms- perhaps sometimes a poster but certainly in magazines. Do you have a memory of them?

2913 2018-02-23 17:41:11 Gasoline is made out of 400 chemicals, there isn’t such a thing as “pure gasoline.” Some are cancer causing like Benzene, Toluene and Xylene. Ethanol is a non toxic way to boost octane and oxygen in the fuel. Oil companies hate it because they can’t control it.
2914 2018-02-23 17:41:06 So you're ok with the billions we give oil companies?
2915 2018-02-23 17:40:38 Carpet Bagger Caforio, the OIL and GAS TRIAL ATTORNEY was a very poor choice by the DEMS in 2016. This is NOT Santa Monica or West Hollywood.

2917 2018-02-23 17:40:27 So what’s the solution then? The only feesable one is to give them a greater stipend or perhaps like a booster club does for HS maybe you go that route. So if the crew wants the new Jordan’s some oil rich guy that dumps money into the program buys them. I dunno what the answer is

2927 2018-02-23 17:38:36 Yeah, it can definitely be helpful for conditioning your beard. Just be careful to not heat it up too much so you don't burn the oil.
-Josh
2928 2018-02-23 17:38:10 Like honestly, please don’t spread false rumors about cancer. Just please leave it to the professionals, cancer patients already hear “eat coconut oil!” Enough

2930 2018-02-23 17:38:06 @GrantonSamboja you should also consider revisiting fare price from voi to wundanyi which was recently increased from 100 to 150 because of increase in oil price by a few shillings.Thats robbing the poor indirectly Mr. governor.
2931 2018-02-23 17:37:55 Sprinkle a little salt in your pan if you're frying. This will prevent the oil from splattering.

2935 2018-02-23 17:37:13 Ahhhh okay. I didn’t think it’s placebo, I’ve heard of a few benefits of CBD oil & what not
2936 2018-02-23 17:37:06 Hypocrisy.  You do realize BC ships vast quantities of O&G in pipelines through AB to the US.  Why don’t Hugo protest those first.  Do you use oil and gas?  Heat your home, have a car, own plastics.
2937 2018-02-23 17:36:58 Fair enough but that's where we are at already, no? It seems the most successful oil & gas companies (Suncor, Enbridge, etc.) all invest in renewables already.
2938 2018-02-23 17:36:43 Almond is great for softening and brightening. Use it as a base with lavender oil or lemon oil and that should work! Also rose water

2943 2018-02-23 17:35:37 gundlach is  wrong  just because you get wage inflation  house prices can go down   oil can go down   and there is no inflation    amazing    clueless
2944 2018-02-23 17:35:24 I recommend that everyone stay away from oils when looking for a face moisturizer. The skin on your face & body are two totally different types. You can use jergens on your skin but never on your face. Same thing with oil.
2945 2018-02-23 17:35:22 Is the oil lady there
2946 2018-02-23 17:35:18 Absolutely, and frankly it makes sense to have more than one customer for our oil & gas. @purpleline
2947 2018-02-23 17:35:14 Im the only person getting my oil changed so i should be in and out.
2948 2018-02-23 17:35:11 450 sanctions imposed by Trump admin against North Korea are targeting their nuclear weapons program. Targeting ships that carry oil may bring this regime to its knees. Note Obama did nothing like this, pretended words alone would suffice.
2949 2018-02-23 17:35:08 Carbon taxes vs. pipeline issues. Which has the larger impact on the #Alberta #oil and gas industry?
2950 2018-02-23 17:35:00 Our last prime minister was was more respected and professional and straight to business.  This guy has managed to turn all kinds of Canadians against each other based on religion, region of country, environmentalist vs oil economy.  He is a one man economy demolition machine
2951 2018-02-23 17:34:44 I'm on air at 7:30--not sure which of my three jobs you want me to "get to work" at? Zero doubt oil & gas can budget--according to their reports Continental made $842 million in the 4th quarter of '17 alone. You don't get there by accident.

2953 2018-02-23 17:34:38 Sanctions on #Russia are quickly having zero effect. While #America's central bank provided capital to buy failed mortgages and #FAANG, Russia's central bank has built #Gold mines and an #Oil and #Gas sector. Putin has all the #Gold and #BlackGold he needs, doesn't need #USD.
2954 2018-02-23 17:34:26 Changing the oil is reasonably quick and easy, it's just legally and properly disposing of the old oil that tends to be a problem sometimes.  It's just less of a hassle to take the car to a shop and less you know of a place to turn in the old oil.  ;-)
2955 2018-02-23 17:34:22 Mi amigo the oil reserves have already been sold to China. We are completely insolvent. Do not invest in Venezuela.

2957 2018-02-23 17:33:45 I'd google how to. Doubt if I can successfully extract the oil from them though. But thanks.
2958 2018-02-23 17:33:32 I use my rope stuff
- the beeswax and jojoba oil

mostly because it is lying around

also - I think having lots of sex would help because of the sweating. I have not tried it myself, but now I want to...

2959 2018-02-23 17:33:21 Got my oil change and i saved money
2960 2018-02-23 17:33:08 and of course I forgot the olive oil part, which should explain the dust

2974 2018-02-23 17:31:38 Hmm almond oil. I think I wanna rejuvenate more i dont have breakouts as much anymore.

2976 2018-02-23 17:31:29 I will eat my shoes if an oil rig pops up there in 2019. Leasing is the first step of a multi-year research, assessment, planning, funding, and execution plan. Execution is the phase with rigs.

2978 2018-02-23 17:31:12 @bamabroker well, for now, NYAD has reclaimed its 50MA. There is still 3 and half hours left but a close above keeps the markets higher for at least a week.

2981 2018-02-23 17:30:48 Don’t scrub shampoo into your roots too much. It makes your sebecious glands release more oil which then makes your hair greasy quicker. Just apply conditioner to the ends. #BblondeBible

3004 2018-02-23 17:28:56 This same logic was used by Congress in the 1980s. 'No one can replace the Congress' was the argument. It was fallacious. Selling snake oil in the form of an anti-Hindu BJP as a solution is a worse crime than having no readymade solution.
3005 2018-02-23 17:28:52 Menses aromatherapy oil. It’s shocking how well it works for just being a blend of oils.

3007 2018-02-23 17:28:30 CBD only extracts are great for people that don't want to get high and hempworx clients are using our pure CBD and getting lots of benefits. Me, personally, I like the high also as a 23+ year "stoner" if ya wanna call it that. I use pure CBD oil and receive benefits for sure.

3032 2018-02-23 17:26:24 You can use aloe Vera gel or anything that’s light/ water based. Oil really isn’t good for the face due to it clogging pores and being a heavy moisturizer.

3034 2018-02-23 17:25:50 Many times over the years the news has said "stocks are down due to a rise in oil prices" and the next day they say "Stocks are up, led by oil companies riding a wave of higher oil prices."
3035 2018-02-23 17:25:48 I thought I knew but apparently was clueless. I would love if you would also investigate the meat & dairy industry, more powerful than oil or guns.

If the intention is to replace Chinese solar panels with US panels, the proper way to do it is to make US panels BETTER and competitively priced (without tariffs).

3113 2018-02-23 17:18:15 We use coconut oil to cook with and moisturise and not only just for that, it's great for treating wood. We've used the coconut oil as a natural stain on our new doorframes rather than chemicalized varnishes!

3159 2018-02-23 17:12:57 I look at the bottle and realize it’s upside down. I flip it and realize the label reads “mystery oil”. I then continue to lather my body.
3160 2018-02-23 17:12:55 Are you saying that taking a class should be a requirement for purchase and ownership of a firearm? Education of how and when to use it?
3161 2018-02-23 17:12:26 Your real target should be Butts. While JT distracts everyone, Butts is quietly curtailing freedoms with the connaivance of MSM: M103, pronouns, pronunciation of French names, threatening freedom on social media, buying more MSM loyalty, killing oil economy etc. @chevymo
3162 2018-02-23 17:12:16 Did we sell any oil or LNG???
3163 2018-02-23 17:12:14 @TheLastLeg#isitok That filibustering about ducks STOPPED the 2nd reading of Paul Flynn Medical cannabis bill    While outside Met Police arrest Jeff Ditchfield of Bud Buddies Project Storm for supplying life saving medicine( cannabis oil ) to a dying child!

3166 2018-02-23 17:12:00 The Google ad system is an annoyance, a bandwidth hogger, a time waster, a storage clogger. Nobody wants Google ads.

3167 2018-02-23 17:11:59 Just woke up. Only reason I'm waking from my slumber is to get my oil changed. Still at pams

3170 2018-02-23 17:11:37 I ONLY came in for an oil change 
3171 2018-02-23 17:11:36 Stop. Cleansing oil tak boleh buat purging 
3172 2018-02-23 17:11:36 The amount of oil my car consumes within two weeks is ridiculous

3176 2018-02-23 17:11:06 I'd believe my own calculations before Westminster and I haven't a clue! Why did they hide The McCrone report, why not show the Full Brexit report to our MSPS,  why no Scot rep at yesterday's mtg, why hide the truth about oil in last referendum?

3179 2018-02-23 17:10:46 $ZN investors surprise me. Who digs oil based in hints in the Bible ?! There were several attempts to search for oil in Emek Izrael; all turned out non commercial. Maybe if they pay, water can turn into oil. The only place with chance for commercial oil is the Golan Heights

3183 2018-02-23 17:10:34 Alternative oils do not have the same rigorous standards in place as #sustainable #palmoil. Producing palm oil to RSPO standards has helped millions of smallholder farmers out of poverty. It also reduces the negative impacts of its cultivation - creating a space where 1/2
3184 2018-02-23 17:10:23 The East prefers lower PM price points to hoard as much as possible, for as long as possible.  Oil has nothing to do with it.

I just hate taking CBD oil (even though I'm allowed to and the oil that I have is medical grade) because it gives me inconsistent results.
3208 2018-02-23 17:08:03 When all you wanted was to go to the Jiffy Lube to get an oil change and they’re over here adding on other shit. Mistake #1 was going to the jiffy lube. – bij Jiffy Lube

3211 2018-02-23 17:07:51 I think this is one of THE most exciting for an Oil & Gas play in this year. The setup, the funding, the proportion of assets, size of prospective prize - its got everything for a very good story. #MATD

3221 2018-02-23 17:07:06 @MBuhari @AsoRock the only way to save naira from the present  herculean pressure is revamp the oil swap policy. The govt can run a pilot revamped oil swap policy in key selected economic windows and evaluate its impact on forex.

3229 2018-02-23 17:06:15 Hey Dum-dum, one “harvests” renewables, like crops. Oil, gas are one time resources and should therefore be conserved.

3231 2018-02-23 17:06:11 Two Oily Close Calls via /r/antiMLM

1: I was getting a 3 hour haircut and color (long hair problems) and got a headache right at the start. My stylist, whom I love, asked if I wanted to put peppermint oil on my temples. I hesitantly asked what brand... fearing the worst... …
3232 2018-02-23 17:06:05 I was amazed when I discovered it! However, it sadly needed someone like Walt to make it work. It's probably a good idea it didn't happen, I think the price of oil shot up which would of probably bankrupted Disney.
3233 2018-02-23 17:06:05 Oh this sounds amazing!  #Gold #Oil
3234 2018-02-23 17:05:49 To a point. But I couldn’t care less about dictatorships. It’s a weak argument. For decades and decades, no-one in the west thought sourcing oil from dictatorships was bad. But now that the US is approaching self sufficiency while screwing us, dictatorship oil is bad? #cdnpoli
3235 2018-02-23 17:05:45 Fish oil vitamins taste so horrible 
3236 2018-02-23 17:05:37 When you can do that with olive oil varietals and blends, you’ll really have something there ;)
3237 2018-02-23 17:05:34 Did the Broward County sheriff lose is discount, like for everything?!
3238 2018-02-23 17:05:33 Exactly, so ridiculous
3239 2018-02-23 17:05:24 The oil lobby is like the NRA except instead of protecting people's rights to kill kids, they're protecting people's rights to commit suicide by planetary death.

Vampires are real but sucking blood was just a metaphor.
3240 2018-02-23 17:05:16 #OOTT US, Canadian, and Brazilian oil production increases are a concern for sure, but on the flip side Libya, Nigeria, and especially Venezuela are all very vulnerable and could see oil output move quickly lower due to internal strife
3241 2018-02-23 17:04:59 Yeah, I haven't really worked out how that's supposed to stop the NRA. Like... members will have less money to spend on dues?
3242 2018-02-23 17:04:57 そうないのよ…Amazonさんに頼むしかない…
3243 2018-02-23 17:04:56 Oil companies refine 83-85 octane gas. Ethanol is cheap octane and is used as an octane booster. Much better then lead or MTBE!
3244 2018-02-23 17:04:54 Oil is the only solution to not be ashy. It’s entirely too hot for lotion

3262 2018-02-23 17:02:50 Is this serious? You guys have apparently never seen the difference in an oil and ethanol spill and the ultimate long-term outcome on the environment. Land use for corn is going down, yet land use for oil going up.

3290 2018-02-23 17:00:11 Does it need oil change occasionally?

3294 2018-02-23 16:59:54 My theory: trump actually believes in global warming (anyone with a brain does) however he wants uneducated Americans to think global warming is a hoax so the ice caps will melt and america and Russia can drill for oil on the bottom of the arctic
3295 2018-02-23 16:59:52 We could look at getting you a quick valve? @JeremyGulick4 has one on his car so it takes just the length of time to drain and refill the oil.

3304 2018-02-23 16:58:28 Oceans aren't the problem here as compared to the oil giant bullies.
3305 2018-02-23 16:58:23 The Chris Christie mug can be also  filled with boiled recycled cooking oil and dumped upon the gunman.
3306 2018-02-23 16:58:23 Dat is the irony. We need to grease their palms despite burning mid night oil.
3307 2018-02-23 16:58:23 I feel like I’m the only one that calls my car a bitch like she one of my friends...
“Just got my bitch washed” 
“Damn my bitch need gas but I’m sleepy but my gas light on... damn bitch” 
“My bitch tweaking cause she need a oil change”
3308 2018-02-23 16:58:21 Then there's Oil and other NATURAL RESOURCES there. Win Win for #USA .
#MAGA !!!
3309 2018-02-23 16:58:06 Absolutely unbelievable. Where do they get this stuff??
3310 2018-02-23 16:58:02 Indian oil advt on every tv channel should be discontinued since the same is waste of public money.

3312 2018-02-23 16:57:53 Does it come with a drip tray for the oil leaks?
3313 2018-02-23 16:57:45 Getting an oil change: “Pop the hood, it’s right down there by your foot”...I know I’m a girl and all but I know how to pop my hood, and no I don’t want whatever you’ll offer me to buy, thanks 
3314 2018-02-23 16:57:41 I need to get an oil change. My feet done and car cleaned.
3315 2018-02-23 16:57:37 The podcast I listened to was about the Florida shooting and how it’s pushing people towards gun control in Minnesota. It also talked about a group of activists who vandalized an oil line “in support of fighting climate change”. #okie1413
3316 2018-02-23 16:57:35 Blue shampoo will help. But deff don’t wash everyday and avoid putting heat to it! It’ll dry it out very quickly. Also coconut oil will add lots of shine!!
3317 2018-02-23 16:57:35 Them: Ano gamit mo panghalo ng ink sa tech pen, baby oil or cooking oil?

3318 2018-02-23 16:57:28 @Jerusalem_Post 

IRAN DEFENCE MINISTER HAVE TWO PLANS WHICH IS EITHER ATTACK ISRAEL OR ATTACK SAUDI ARABIA?

THE BIBLE SAID THAT IRAN WILL ATTACK ISRAEL.

IF IRAN ATTACK SAUDI ARABIA BECAUSE IT WANT TO DESTROY SAUDI ARABIA OIL INDUSTRIES?

RUSSIA WILL ASK IRAN TO ATTACK ISRAEL?
3319 2018-02-23 16:57:19 Danville is an urban area.. no oil or gas wells.. what it does have is the Hayward and Calaveras faults.. the ones most likely to go in the next big one
3320 2018-02-23 16:57:11 The article's numbers are for projected oil sands emissions compared to Canada's various emissions targets. The 78% is for 2050. So the tweet needs clarifying.
3321 2018-02-23 16:56:57 お互いターンが来るたびにダメージやったよね、たしか
3322 2018-02-23 16:56:51 Economic and religious reforms are required in Saudi Arabia. They are moving in the right direction. Can't just sit on oil wealth.
3323 2018-02-23 16:56:50 Production Increase?-> Cabimas in Venezuela’s Zulia State which is the hub of the Maracaibo Lake East Coast oil fields has been without power for 19 consecutive hours and counting.
3324 2018-02-23 16:56:36 That’s right. Now tie it back on to your truck and leave, you’re leaking oil all over the damn parking lot.

3328 2018-02-23 16:56:02 “The Snake” read by a Snake Oil Salesman. Wouldn’t be surprised if they give out pitch forks and torches at the end. 
3329 2018-02-23 16:56:00 35. Don't despise what you have, like the 'oil woman'. It might not look pronounced, but that's all God needs to turn your case around.
3330 2018-02-23 16:55:55 dropped my car off for a oil change now they find 3 other things wrong with my car 
3331 2018-02-23 16:55:33 It takes me back to the days of Jim Jones nd his followers. The Trumpists are also naive, ill informed people happy to drink the Kool Aid.  Hard to believ this is an American president here ranting and lying  like a 2 bit snake oil salesman. Our allies are watching in horror.
3332 2018-02-23 16:55:29 Thank you I'll check it out. I once made my own then it started to disintegrate because of the oil . 
3333 2018-02-23 16:55:29 #OOTT | The decline of stockpiles is starting to turn into a potentially critical situation that could be very supportive for West Texas Intermediate crude prices, plus the trouble in Libya seems to be on the upswing. cc. @KilduffReport #WTI #Brent #Oil

3339 2018-02-23 16:54:24 I’ve been growing it since by buddy Drew’s wedding on June 15th. Bed head shampoo and conditioner, pacino’s beard oil twice a day and beard butter to get it to lay down. And you absolutely talk to it. People are much friendlier for some reason. And make no eye contact
3340 2018-02-23 16:54:18 All you need is an oil well. Or just $$$. I bet Mike Motwani could be Rex any year he chose to.
3341 2018-02-23 16:54:14 Does the use of alcohol in thousands of deaths each year mean that those producers live off of "blood money?"  Even though a small segment of the population can't consume their product responsibly?

3344 2018-02-23 16:54:00 But not the brutal dictators running amuck in Africa etc...im sure the routing of oil pipelines across #Syria and the #Russian proxy war have nothing to do with getting rid of #Assad.
3345 2018-02-25 23:59:56 i believe it is we who got the last laugh. Your entire military force, with iranians couldnt get to Feshkhabour. You have no border with Turkey. You still have to use our pipeline. Kirkuk oil is down to 60k bpd because we have the codes.  whos laughing now.

Who should I vote for?
3353 2018-02-25 23:58:49 Easy:

1. Fry 2tsp whole cumin seeds, 1tsp mustard seed for 20sec (til aromatic) in 1tbs oil. 

2. add 4 finely chopped garlic clove, 2-3 inch shredded ginger, medium white onion, 1/4 tsp turmeric, 1tsp Cheyenne chili powder, 1 chopped green chili, fry until onion goes clear
3354 2018-02-25 23:58:13 I do none of those that's probably why but thank you thank you thank you for reminding me about castor oil I've been meaning to try that for so long
3355 2018-02-25 23:57:43 I know! It's been close to the mark for a few years now! They've just got to solve the issue that the lithium needed for the batteries to power the electric motors that everyone says is the future is gonna run out around the same time as oil
3356 2018-02-25 23:57:17 No I haven't. The main reason the US attacked Serbia is because they wanted to build an oil pipeline through Kosovo... which is why they made it an independent country, slabbed the biggest US base in the world... and built their oil pipeline.

Hopefully it will help with anxiety and sleep 
3396 2018-02-25 23:53:58 When you’re certain ur gonna get a pimple so you slap on a face mask and bathe in tea tree oil.
3397 2018-02-25 23:53:58 None of them, that’s the point. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting oil futures one summer and Eduardo won’t come close to getting in. The ability to make money doesn’t impress anybody around here.

3409 2018-02-25 23:51:26 Anything more than 21 rounds is kinda unnecessary. You would probably be dead by the 5th shot you get off anyways. Life is not COD. I like to shoot larger rounds but I don't have the money to build a mound in the backyard like some gun ranges. Oil filter suppression would be nice

Harper was only Mailroom Clerk in Oil Co, job his dad got him when he dropped out of Uni & fam didn't want him home
3418 2018-02-25 23:50:01 Mess? Harper was One of Canada's STRONGEST PMs. He knew what was most important for a STRONG #ECONOMY. Pushing for #PIPELINES so Canada could be an "international" supplier to Asia&India. All Biz ppl know #OIL #LNG r by far still the world's richest commodities - admit it or not.
3419 2018-02-25 23:49:51 @CleavageCrumbs Well, Dave bought me Nutella...Unfortunately, it's loaded with palm oil. Thousands of Orangutans are slaughtered, severely injured and orphaned yearly for it in the rain forests. 
And it's too sweet. But, I tried it!!! 
I'm more a salt lover.

dollar will rise, euro will fall (6 months), oil will rise, gold will go down, equities will rise above the levels of last friday, the crash of all crashes will come  (within 4 years) but not at this moment, stock markets will fall under the lows of februar (2 months)

3432 2018-02-25 23:48:28 Impossible to be a cordially polite woman to the mechanic changing your oil without having to eventually bring up a boyfriend (real or not) every chance you can so they'll stop hitting on you.

3437 2018-02-25 23:47:50 And Norway won the most. Trump likes Norway, it's full of tall, strong, white people. They've got lots of oil and  amazing health and education systems, 
#socialism
3438 2018-02-25 23:47:38 It's poor business to go out of your way to piss off customers. Personally dump stock in thses before earnings/price gets hammered.
3439 2018-02-25 23:47:35 WOW! How did Paul Ryan raise $1O,OOO,OOO.OO 
 
- The #GunLobby for letting assault rifles go unchecked.
- CEOs for their #Cash  windfall for more private #Jets & #vacation homes
- Big #Oil for handing them free-reign to #pollute 
HELP! @NancyPelosi
3440 2018-02-25 23:47:32 We have Snake Oil salesmen promoting #Brexit and #Lexit

Politicians on both sides of the Commons are proudly trashing their reputations on the altar of #HardBrexit

A plague on both their houses.

3441 2018-02-25 23:47:24 Oil and gas office job now bro bro. Got out the gas station life 
3442 2018-02-25 23:47:21 It's that the oil industry saved the whales. It's a true story.
3443 2018-02-25 23:47:15 Love!!   FYI I live in a van and travel around oil painting. Thus, VanGo
3444 2018-02-25 23:47:10 So I've been oil pulling for the last 2 weeks and I think I swallowed some coconut oil because my stomach been hurting for like 2 days now.

3447 2018-02-25 23:46:13 Prime Minister Trudeau was a snowboard instructor when he was a student- most of us had jobs to earn money. His career was a Math/French Teacher. 
Why do YOU need to make stuff up? So U can feel better about your Insurance Salesman or the Mailroom Clerk at the Oil Co.? #cdnpoli
3448 2018-02-25 23:46:13 Did Wallace get in the oil slick? There's no footage of him wrecking it seems
3449 2018-02-25 23:46:10 Your math is off.  Shouldn't listen to the tabloids.  Even if it is $2/bbl increase, the price received for the oil will be $15/bbl higher and offset any tarrif increase.  Also, $2/bbl is only 3% increase on cost/bbl...
3450 2018-02-25 23:46:06 Apologies again, #Nostalgiachat tweeple! Not only am I feeling out of sorts, but that #grant application submission I'm working on is due this week so am burning the midnight oil. Have a good week all

3453 2018-02-25 23:46:02 Hahaha. I am lucky that I have a Latina mama. So, I got some good genes there. And we do the Oil of Orale, you know? I am a meat eater, but regular exercise and diet seems to be improving what I allowed to go to shit.
3454 2018-02-25 23:45:51 Why oil and water do mix
3455 2018-02-25 23:45:45 Oil pressure still up. We should be able to get a finish. 25 laps to go.
3456 2018-02-25 23:45:44 If Trader Joe’s is starting to sell Rosehip oil and cloth dish towels, they are WAY past due for selling tampons.

3459 2018-02-25 23:45:24 Dr T, I listened to your Insulin resistance video.  There is alot of medical info that for a lay person like me, it goes over my head.  However, are you saying those of us that are Insulin Resistance should eat less fat (butter, coconut oil, olive oil etc)?  1/2
3460 2018-02-25 23:45:02 Coconut oil has done wonders for me, I put it on at night leave until morning (sleep on a towel, wash, condition and blow dry on a low heat should help with the frizz x

3466 2018-02-25 23:44:20 Tea tree oil works wonders for dark spots! I’ve been using it since December and I’ve seen a big difference. I only use it like every other day though because it is drying.
3467 2018-02-25 23:44:01 y is there someone on my tl sayin to use nothin but grapeseed oil, coconut oil, n shea butter for skincare?? y’all want ppl to look like an order of popeyes chicken??
3468 2018-02-25 23:43:55 I’m so sick of the blame falling on everyone but the cowards who failed to do their own damn jobs.
3469 2018-02-25 23:43:54 If you’re against Republicans receiving money from the NRA, then you must be against Democrats receiving money from big pharma, healthcare insurance, real estate developers, oil & gas, student loan collectors - who have put people into poverty, homelessness, illness and death.
3470 2018-02-25 23:43:48 Islam and America is oil and water, they do not mix. Freedom of religion is good but if a religion opens the door to hate and to abuse women because of religious beliefs, that is wrong. And it's dark and dangerous. This is the truth of what is morally right.
3471 2018-02-25 23:43:43 Psalms Chapter 23 verse
5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.

Putin's boy creating a wedge between US and Europe and the rest of the world, Yep, sounds like Russia is benefiting bigly. (oh and the uranium isn't a one-person decision)
3579 2018-02-25 23:23:42 I don't know if you are being rhetorical or not...I don't want to give unwanted advice. Have you tried cbd oil?

3582 2018-02-25 23:23:19 If it is built it could be over dead bodies. Reconciliation will not happen before truth and justice first. This is a truth and justice issue. Colonization is losing its power. Colonizers with colonial oil greed in mind be warned. Canada does not own BC. First Nations do.
3583 2018-02-25 23:23:00 Spiders hate peppermint oil. Put some in a squirt bottle + water and spray your garage and all door frames.
3584 2018-02-25 23:22:59 Things that make you go hmmmm. Why do I have to pay an oil disposal fee if I’m allowing the oil changer to dispose of 5 quarts of oil in my car?
3585 2018-02-25 23:22:45 South Sudan was bloodily carved out with western backing to walk off with two thirds of Sudan's oil. Now we quietly back wars of ethnic cleansing to secure the prize.

3587 2018-02-25 23:21:32 The US violently asserts itself across the world more than any other nation for imperialist purposes. The oil in Iraq and Libya, the cheap labor in Africa and South America, etc. are the guides of American foreign policy, not abstract morals.
3588 2018-02-25 23:21:31 there are two reasons AB does not have new refineries: 
1. more emissions would count against Paris cap.
2. Big oil will not allow it to happen, and Alberta *always* does what big oil says. since Lougheed left.

3641 2018-02-25 23:13:24 @DLoesh says the NRA is a fellowship of gun owners. Okay, then the American Petroleum Institute is a "fellowship" of oil companies? The US Chamber of Commerce is a "fellowship" of business owners? Pharma is a "fellowship" of drug manufacturers?

3644 2018-02-25 23:13:13 You need Deep Mushrooms, and possibly Blood Oil. Both are in the Blood Kelp zones. One zone is about 1.5km North by Northwest of the Escape Pod (past the sunken islands), starting at about 250M down.
3645 2018-02-25 23:13:07 You still have time for the oil change.
3646 2018-02-25 23:12:56 take oil instead brother ;)
3647 2018-02-25 23:12:51 Day 2 trying CBD oil. It doesn’t help that I have a disc or 2 in my neck out. I guess I was expecting INSTANT results, but I was told to give it a little time. I actually had dreams, which when I had my sleep study, it showed I get 0 REM sleep. Could it be the CBD? 
3648 2018-02-25 23:12:36 They should turn the oil slider up, actually
3649 2018-02-25 23:12:30 CBD oil taste worse than edibles

3657 2018-02-25 23:11:54 Murray Edwards, an investor with Bill Gates in Carbon Engineering, Dr David Keith's startup, is an oil and coal mogul. It's clear that artificial cloud cover that is a band aid for global warming, would appeal to fossil fuel magnates who want 20 years more to sell product.

3677 2018-02-25 23:09:23 I eat avocados with a spoon and it is quite a yummy experience. A little sea salt and olive oil and I am in avocado heaven. Now, peas on mac & cheese...? I still prefer broccoli and carrot crumbles instead.
3678 2018-02-25 23:09:20 Allegra D , saline solution , humidification , essential oil diffuser ; use oils for breathing and allergies many brands have blends to achieve your needs.

3686 2018-02-25 23:07:18 This was always about oil. Obama placed sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine elections (Manafort was campaign adviser) so they sent Manafort to get Trump elected & lift those sanctions

3708 2018-02-25 23:04:07 Oil change every 5000km - piece of cake. US dealer called and asked "what is the commonest cause of failure?". Company said: "we’ll let you know when we’ve had one."  Brilliant bit of kit.
3709 2018-02-25 23:03:50 But the problem with tar sands oil is it costs so much to refine. That is why no one is willing to pay anything for it. Bituman is still Bituman no matter how many pipelines it runs through. It still won't fetch a good price

3723 2018-02-25 23:01:41 Snake oil sales man telling others about selling snake oil. Oh do grow up.  You're embarrassing.
3724 2018-02-25 23:01:38 Building more refineries would not stop or delay pipelines.  Unfortunately however, policies that could result in more oil refineries would necessarily expend or waste some amount of tax dollars.  Someone has to pay for a domestic refinery advantage... I say that as a Green.

Concerned about the increase of pollution for residents of Vancouver from increased tanker traffic & residents around oil sands.. increased health risk is unacceptable.

3730 2018-02-25 23:00:52 You seem to be good at repeating leftist-progressive false narrative talking points but fail to examine an actual record:

1. Trump's massive deregulation of domestic USA energy industry & corporate tax cuts unleash oil, coal & gas companies & hurts Russia in world energy market

3736 2018-02-25 23:00:28 Incense symbolizes prayer. Is making illicit copies of God's incense oil analogous to misdirected, unrighteous, or self-aggrandizing prayers? See Exodus 30:38 & James 4:3
3737 2018-02-25 23:00:19 You’re as corrupt as this country has ever seen. You are bought and paid for by the NRA and big oil. Mueller will bring you down and Montana will be forever grateful.

3761 2018-02-25 22:57:40 Apologies. I should have said that the rapeseed oil is richer in mono unsaturated fats and that I, personally, am trying to reduce my saturated fat intake. A personal choice and I do still balance it with a lower level of saturated fats.
3762 2018-02-25 22:57:40 Yeah...I won't be watching...but the armed security will be thick...

Because people who PRETEND for a living are much more important than our school kids.
3763 2018-02-25 22:57:33 Not just the Archbishop of Canterbury but a former oil exec who frequently writes about money and Christianity. And he argued against “lynch mob” mentality against bankers in 2013. Even this Archbishop of Canterbury has said this.

3766 2018-02-25 22:57:10 Jim Himes (D-CT) @FoxNewsSunday tries to sell snake oil when describing the Dem Memo, to counter the Nunez Memo. He fails to make his points and reveals a very weak  argument. It appeared like deception. There is no Russian collusion.

3769 2018-02-25 22:56:48 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.

3778 2018-02-25 22:54:56 I felt the same way about that war. It was both a complete diversion from the failure to find Osama bin Laden, & a twisted excuse for GOPers to make $ by trying to take over Iraq's oil fields, all while unnecessarily killing/disabling not just 1000s of our people but Iraq's, too.

3781 2018-02-25 22:54:21 I saw two massive oil drums floating swiftly downstream today. I cringe thinking about all the garbage, etc that was churned up and the hazards to boaters in the not-too-distant future. #CKFlood2018 #keepyoureyespeeled
3782 2018-02-25 22:54:11 Laughing out loud right now. Putting on airs of sovereignty doesn’t change the fact that America is THE imperialist nation. Cute that you think oil nations “annexing shit” is anywhere close to the hold America has on most of the third world.

3787 2018-02-25 22:53:26 Hi does oil block also mean oil field bcz I don't understand this oil block so I asked google but its saying oil field... Are they the same ?
3788 2018-02-25 22:53:12 Just how many billions should we send to that corrupt government that was using oil and gas fired generators even though they have blazing sun 355 days of the year? I've been there 7 times. You don't know shit kid. You'd get your ass kicked and robbed soon as it got dark.
3789 2018-02-25 22:53:10 But oil centralizes wealth. We supported Arab Spring, how do you figure we are the ones preventing Democracy?
3790 2018-02-25 22:53:06 You had to tell me about the oil crisis? Ok, I don’t have to misrepresent you, you do that perfectly well for yourself.
3791 2018-02-25 22:52:38 5 hours waiting on an oil change
3792 2018-02-25 22:52:29 Muslim Fundamentalism was the enforcing device to procure plenty of oil and gas from the Middle East, and make it a big mess to weaken Europe. All US Americans should know this, but, if they are real patriots, they should confine that knowledge to the subconscious realm!
3793 2018-02-25 22:52:26 Just checked our little studio space to see what the Viking is doing. She's blasting Jimmy Hendricks playing the Star Spangled Banner at Woodstock as she works on her oil painting.

3796 2018-02-25 22:51:55 Ooooh I hadn’t heard that one and I might? I tried nail polish remover and toothpaste with no luck and was about to try vinegar dishwashing detergent but coconut oil sounds much less gross.

3803 2018-02-25 22:51:18 It's quite nice actually, esp if you don't want all of the fat/oil
3804 2018-02-25 22:51:11 Since Obama retired to private life, we've needed someone to assume the mantle of "World's Greatest Gun Salesman".

No surprise that he's being propped up by our discredited legacy media.

Having spent 20-odd years having to install and maintain sensor and power systems on North Sea oil rigs, sealing equipment is not exactly news. But yeah, most people don't do this, so domestic installations may have issues. Industrially, it's routine.

3859 2018-02-25 22:42:36 or to speak to an oil consortium 
3860 2018-02-25 22:42:35 According to tips I read it might help to wear sunblock creams during the winter. That might indeed help a bit, sounds logical. Maybe spray-able skin oil before showering helps as well. I have plenty skin oils like Vitamin E, Calendula etc.
3861 2018-02-25 22:42:25 What? I lie? Na only Alakija accept an Oil Well rejected by others including me, in faith 
3862 2018-02-25 22:42:23 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
3863 2018-02-25 22:42:23 The mere fact that 15 out of 19 terrorists hailed from Saudi Araba is, obviously, an indictment on our relationship with with the oil rich country.  But this is where things really get spooky --  the remaining four were from Derry, Maine.
3864 2018-02-25 22:42:20 My dog ate chocolate when she was a puppy & my mom gave her a spoonful of extra virgin olive oil. She’s still with us 6 years later 
3865 2018-02-25 22:42:13 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
3866 2018-02-25 22:42:05 Snake oil, my arse!
3867 2018-02-25 22:42:00 He won’t share the exact recipe but does say hot hot oil and room temp batter, a bit more flour in it than recipes call for, by a couple tbsp
3868 2018-02-25 22:41:54 dude coconut oil changed my skins life it works for some people. most moisturizers have random chemicals in them that people w really sensitive skin break out from so coconut oil all the way

At night I spray my hair with aloe juice and do two braids and it helped me a lot

3873 2018-02-25 22:41:33 Hold oil and gas responsible.
3874 2018-02-25 22:41:16 My hubba uses very very hot oil and room temp batter. But whatever works, ppl have their tricks
3875 2018-02-25 22:41:04 Girl, are you a roughneck? Because you are a member of the crew of an oil rig other than the driller.
3876 2018-02-25 22:41:04 I have to admit I don’t know much about the customers of diluted bitumen. Are they upgrading it through processing to make the same products as one does with crude oil or does it serve a different niche altogether? Or do people do both?
3877 2018-02-25 22:40:52 Wow, welcome onboard, good to have you around. Been saying this thing is the Northern version of oil well. If it can't be found under the Rocks then, Boko Haram. At the end all that matters is the Dollar afterall. And it's pouring in from home and abroad.
3878 2018-02-25 22:40:52 Hey thank you!! I use softee coconut oil hair grease, andis flat iron and got2b freeze spray reallly lightly so my leave out doesn’t get too stiff. 
3879 2018-02-25 22:40:52 Can't say I'm following all your arguments but my bottom line:  that oil needs to stay in the ground if we're to meet 2 C or 1.5 C global temp increases.
3880 2018-02-25 22:40:45 Doesn't that rely on a decibel level that can be considered a bit high? I got one'a them battery powered leaf blowers, it's awesome. Super quiet, my arm doesn't feel like its vibrating for an hour after I'm done, and I never have to worry about gas/oil mix or any of that shit.
3881 2018-02-25 22:40:39 Man I bet @davidhogg111 never thought he would sell this many guns.
3882 2018-02-25 22:40:38 Imma suggest boi oil to reduce the appearance of acne scars and hydrate your skin

3884 2018-02-25 22:40:33 truth is our father Krsna without him nothing works the world turns cold and dark and gly and enters low region of smog and all. they need to divest from oil fast too, it stinks its decrypted, dont go towards evil find light, find me im put out for sticking up for light, for me
3885 2018-02-25 22:40:31 Sorry @RickSantorum. Once again you are selling snake oil. I was a single mom for years, and none of my kids are 1) in jail, 2) on drugs, 3) own any form of gun. Stick that in your pipe and smoke it. #singlemomsdoingitforthemselves
3886 2018-02-25 22:40:17 The only lies I remember were the ones told in the white paper about how great it would be and how we would be in the land of milk and honey (based on an oil price that bombed).
We would be eating rats around a burning tyre rather than debating on twitter if we hadnt saved you.

3893 2018-02-25 22:39:21 Nationalize our oil sector, buy out foriegn companies now while the price is cheap, build refineries, stop importing oil from other countries. Keep the profits in Canada.

3900 2018-02-25 22:38:30 C-P-C has increased gasoline and diesel prices at the pump by 0.4 N-T per liter from this morning, in reflection of a slight rebound in international crude oil prices.
3901 2018-02-25 22:38:20 Drilling for oil
3902 2018-02-25 22:38:01 Oil is a militarily strategic resource, it is heavily regulated, controlled by government actions, highly political. In no way is it a free market.
3903 2018-02-25 22:37:49 You gonna stop driving You're car now? You hate oil so much.
3904 2018-02-25 22:37:44 Britain has finite amount of natural resources : fresh water for drinking and farming, farmable land, oil, etc. The more persons allowed to immigrate into Britain, the fewer natural resources there will be for each British person, and the poorer the average British person will be
3905 2018-02-25 22:37:30 Trudeau & NDP = hate of Canadian Natural Resources. Electric goes 300km = short cross country trip. Might try Oil
3906 2018-02-25 22:37:26 Well you’ve got to really warm the oil through. And there’s a lot of it

3914 2018-02-25 22:36:18 Norway is an example of a socialist country with one of the highest QOL (if not the highest), though it's backed by oil. Other nordic countries are good examples too.

3925 2018-02-25 22:34:58 No,  I blamed no oil for the gulf oil disaster they knew that something was very very wrong with the oil rig and didn't do anything or enough to prevent it from happening.

3930 2018-02-25 22:34:16 I totally agree. I don't even want to risk CBT oil. We are factoring this into where we decided to look to move to. Right now CA, OR, and WA are where we are focusing
3931 2018-02-25 22:34:08 I put half body lotion, half coconut oil, in an old body butter tub & microwave for 15-20 seconds 
3932 2018-02-25 22:34:03 Oi that's ridiculous don't you know mother nature has tits and she lactates oil???
3933 2018-02-25 22:33:47 I did too
3934 2018-02-25 22:33:46 I saw all sorts in recruit trg inc lighters (you’re just setting fire to the oil in the polish. Y’know, the bit that makes it all shiny), hair dryers and even milk (don’t ask). I thoroughly soak my duster, wring it out a bit and carry on. Finish off with wool.
3935 2018-02-25 22:33:35 Worked out, had a quality studio session, bought groceries, got an oil change and the Spurs are currently playing well. Nice Sunday so far.
3936 2018-02-25 22:33:26 Would be a good time to Nationalize our oil. Buy out all the foreign companies for a bargain today, build refineries, stop importing oil from overseas and keep the profits here in Canada. Sounds like a socialist strategy but tell that to Norway and their 1 trillion dollar reserve
3937 2018-02-25 22:33:20 Mr Davis selling silly expensive  audiophile cables. Snake oil less of a con.

3941 2018-02-25 22:33:04 The only things he cultivates are the coal and oil producers and garners money from them. A truly dirty deal.
3942 2018-02-25 22:32:21 Of course.. his gods are OIL and COAL.

3951 2018-02-25 22:30:16 Pretty much every vegetable you hated as a little kid would taste better if you roasted it with salt and olive oil instead of boiling it.
3952 2018-02-25 22:30:06 Imagine the assets owned by banks globally that rely on Oil as their value. Buildings, land, leases, contracts, insurance premiums, all of it. Now decimate that value over night. Add coal and Natural Gas assets. Decimate them, too. Their minds will never accept that reality.

3955 2018-02-25 22:28:48 trying to make sense of the argument that enormous spending on oil imports would somehow be offset by increased oil exports. Invest in refining here?
3956 2018-02-25 22:28:47 We know you don't care about Scotland but why is WM is hell bent on keeping Scotland in the UK? Is it the 300 billion of oil tax revenue sent to WM over the last four decades? Is Scotland subsidising England? We'll find out when Scotland leaves the union.

3960 2018-02-25 22:28:02 Skin on a daily basis. Getting rid of any leftover debris and dead skin cells that could trap oil and cause breakouts (on your t zone). Use it after your favorite cleanser and before moisturizer 
3961 2018-02-25 22:27:58 You could! Cut the eggplants thin, dip them in seasoned flour, then beaten whole eggs, then in Panko bread crumbs and fry in oil. Then you can use those crispy egg plants as layers to give it a nice texture !
3962 2018-02-25 22:27:40 Dude, it's a no brainer, the smaller the peso compare to dollars the more it cost to buy oil for Energy, if energy goes up, everything goes up,and yet this government is full of failure and lack of compassionate to people, they fail to raise the minimum wage.

3966 2018-02-25 22:26:26 Yes! Contrary to common belief applying oils topically to oily skin tricks it into thinking it's produced enough, so it helps to actually balance over secretion of oil. Plus all the oils used in that blend won't clog pores

Too bad they didn't own your crystal ball and see US shale oil in the future.

3986 2018-02-25 22:23:30 He's 100% a hypocrite. He criticizes others for flip flopping yet he CONSTANTLY does. He continues to alienate the base that supports him day by day. What good choices? He hasn't made ONE since he took office and hasn't fulfilled one campaign promise. He's a snake oil salesman.
3987 2018-02-25 22:23:28 Face it nobody wants that dirty tar sands oil. Natives don't want pipelines. BC does not want pipelines. Time to diversify that economy Alberta instead of blaming others for wanting clean energy alternatives

3999 2018-02-25 22:21:56 How will shipping more bitumen overseas reduce the demand for oil imports? Seems like an incoherent line of argument.

4004 2018-02-25 22:21:22 I think tonnes in both categories have increased.  Also with potash, oil, ore and containers.  The rail capacity doesn't seem to have grown in step.  Except maybe for us in the South who have access to BNSF.
4005 2018-02-25 22:21:11 I think CBL is relying on oil revenue. Which relies on stable situ.  Which relies on an organised army.  Which needs weapons . . .

4016 2018-02-25 22:18:57 Actually there IS a need to greatly increase oil pipeline capacity from #abpoli to #bcpoli tidewater - the Alberta economy and petroleum producers including "tarsands" do NEED access to alternative markets in order to get fair prices from USA
4017 2018-02-25 22:18:51 Thanks for making the trip Oil Barons!!!
4018 2018-02-25 22:18:50 Well I’m not just talking about Assad. I’m not sure where your info comes from on that though, by all trustworthy accounts he is a piece of shit war criminal. But I’m talking about Arab Spring in general. Oil wealth has created plutocracies that are inherently bad for democracy
4019 2018-02-25 22:18:46 Well he should know, the  #TrumpRussa Conspiracy is about Gas, Oil and Sanctions.

4030 2018-02-25 22:17:04 I am aware of that. My concern is raw bitumen. I just want to know if there is a process proven to be able to clean it up. I want a scientific answer not people from the oil patch who only care about their jobs and not anyone elses.
4031 2018-02-25 22:16:39 Been working in the oil field for 2 months now....kinda loving this shit 
4032 2018-02-25 22:16:29 that slick oil look is a strong one
4033 2018-02-25 22:16:20 But the monounsatutated C:18 aka oleic acid,  the one found in olive oil was higher which defies pretty well all other results since about 6000BC

4042 2018-02-25 22:15:18 I would think it is conflicts at political level that are the issue> #Australia earns 'income', and jobs, from exporting #coal, #gas, #oil; people care about #environment but aren't willing to give up individual living standards, or social welfare payments, to balance loss income

4061 2018-02-25 22:11:13 the body can endogenously synthesize oleic acid but not LA so we know it’s relevant to dietary intake not so with oleic acid  2.) giving olive oil reduces LDL oxidation, whereas LA increases LDL oxidation, 3.)

4134 2018-02-25 22:00:28 Be cautious with those mail-order "biblical" oils. God said don't make copies of the Tabernacle oil. Exodus 30:31-33
4135 2018-02-25 22:00:26 February 25, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
4136 2018-02-25 22:00:25 The USA has a finite amount of natural resources : fresh water for drinking and farming, farmable land, oil, etc. The more persons allowed to immigrate into the USA, the fewer natural resources there will be for each American, and the poorer the average American will be.

4138 2018-02-25 22:00:21 I am ON that golden milk train. Recipe: one cup almond milk, one tbsp honey, one tbsp coconut oil, 1/2 tsp ginger, 1/2 tsp turmeric, 4 whole black peppercorns, 1 cup water. Combine all ingredients in a sauce pan, whisk, heat, and serve. YUM

4140 2018-02-25 21:59:25 Oil and gas accounting is quite interesting
4141 2018-02-25 21:59:23 In high school I worked the customer service desk with a woman who not only had the worst foot odor I've ever smelled, but she used so much lilac essential oil that the scents mingled to for this melange du mort that scarred me for life.
4142 2018-02-25 21:58:57 The forthcoming earthly kingdom of God is light and has a boundary. Therefore the surrounding area must be outer darkness. Most Christians don't have enough oil in their lamp; God only knows who does. Not to worry, most will learn as per Micah 4:2.
4143 2018-02-25 21:58:49 Spilt all my oil in the dryer 
4144 2018-02-25 21:58:34 I have a stomach ache and got drafted to make chicken fingers for the PPV tonight. I'm sure standing in front of 350 degree oil will make me feel much better. (the twee'est tweets on twitter!)
4145 2018-02-25 21:58:32 Now that we’ve stolen all your oil we’re going to Electric vehicles so you can be on your way
4146 2018-02-25 21:58:23 I want an oil painting of me and my sons, so bad!!! All these beautiful Nigerian artworks is doing something to me. This will be added to my to do list. I would also love a mural done on my bedroom wall. One day this dream will manifest itself 
4147 2018-02-25 21:58:15 Just did my nails and fixed my zits on my face now I guess I should put coconut oil in my hair

4150 2018-02-25 21:56:59 Is that bigger than selling 40 billon dollars oil and said its 20 billion? Did Jonathan and you his compatriot give account for 20 billon as Sanusi lamented
4151 2018-02-25 21:56:51 2 hours until our oil change is done???? The frick.
4152 2018-02-25 21:56:43 Just get a little travel pot, pop in some coconut oil then add a few drops of tea tree oil and lavender oil. Mix it up and you are good to go! I've read a few serums use similar essential oils in them #GRLPOWR
4153 2018-02-25 21:56:33 A classic muscle car, a bodybuilder's physique and a gallon of body oil go a long way in some circles.
4154 2018-02-25 21:56:33 Michael Caine recommends cold oil. But he's an actor
4155 2018-02-25 21:56:29 I hope they find heaps of oil. My V8 needs plenty!
4156 2018-02-25 21:56:28 Coconut oil is working as a good underneath makeup moisturizer
4157 2018-02-25 21:56:01 Woow complicated. May Allah bring an end to their pain
4158 2018-02-25 21:55:50 Yes, all are oil except the first one that was a separate tweet :)
4159 2018-02-25 21:55:43 Lol....if you want a cleans...roast Broccoli with lite virgin oil and Parisian cheese...it's delicious
4160 2018-02-25 21:55:33 ...that would be the reason Obama had to give the Terrorist clerics in Iran $150B to save their failing state. Oil prices and sanctions were working,, but Obama had to save them. Got it. I would be roflmao at you and Obama, were it not so sad.
4161 2018-02-25 21:55:31 Goose fat is for when your parents cook them at home. Good olive oil is the true king. Quite like the sous vide suggestion tho. I may investigate.
4162 2018-02-25 21:55:19 I put lots of Rose hip oil on this morning 
4163 2018-02-25 21:55:17 Just drowned my pizza in chilli oil. Hopefully this will get rid of my sore throat. FFS. I’ve just been sick, why???
4164 2018-02-25 21:55:17 Yes please....... hurry up! is it Manchego?
4165 2018-02-25 21:55:17 So nobody was gonna tell me Dons didn’t do oil changes on Sundays 
4166 2018-02-25 21:55:17 An oil based substance entered the surface water drainage system at a point where it drains directly into the River Kennet. More than that I cannot say.
4167 2018-02-25 21:55:07 Try shampooing the hair with cooler water and massage your scal softly to reduce the amount of oil being produced #HairTips #Delaware #VirginHairObsession
4168 2018-02-25 21:54:47 Me too
4169 2018-02-25 21:54:40 Grassyass. Thanks for inspiring us  Let's get a night together organised 
4170 2018-02-25 21:54:25 these are flexible funnels, useful for like adding oil to a car
4171 2018-02-25 21:53:56 Sea moss, Bladderwrack, chlorella black seed oil, Ashwagandha, moringa, hibiscus.... all these things I’ve been consuming today not to mention chamomile  just to name a few....
4172 2018-02-25 21:53:53 Not an option when Other Half is diabetic. Palm oil (one of the main take-away ingredients) is poison to diabetic trying to control glucose via dietary controls. Lucky I don't miss curries!
4173 2018-02-25 21:53:22 Inept deputies and incompetence doesn't fit the gun grab narrative.
4174 2018-02-25 21:53:19 That scientific evidence and consensus should guide policy, not ignorant rhetoric. 

That green energy is can be more profitable and creates more jobs than coil or oil. 

That education is more important than weapons training.
4175 2018-02-25 21:53:16 While Russia and Iran pulverize #Damascus suburbs loaded with civilians that are blockaded and sieged our press promote Putin's ceasefires and deescalation zones - ie: kill boxes

either they are completely detached from reality
or they take Russia's oil money, pay for print
4176 2018-02-25 21:52:57 @carothek following you! Financial #journalist covering #oil and other commodities @argusmedia // London, Paris and the worldwide known (mostly by pigeons) grain port of Rouen.
4177 2018-02-25 21:52:45 Great write-up!  Speakeasies, Standard Oil and NYC — deadly interesting topic!  
4178 2018-02-25 21:52:45 What kind of snake oil are they trying to sale now? REALLY?
4179 2018-02-25 21:52:41 I can’t tell if you’re saying Trump hotels trump (beat out) businesses and big oil OR if you’re saying Trump hotels, Trump businesses and big oil.
Even though both sentences are  answer the question.
4180 2018-02-25 21:52:39 No need. Your food always looks fabulous.
4181 2018-02-25 21:52:01 Hot oil treatment Sundays 
4182 2018-02-25 21:51:59 Petty children can't see the distinction.  Full on petty about everything, every hour, every day.   Exhausting to watch.
4183 2018-02-25 21:51:43 We're so delighted to hear that! Kick back and enjoy that silky feel of Fair Trade Organic Cocoa Butter and uplifting orange oil while being a supportive ally! 
4184 2018-02-25 21:51:33 You don’t know what you are talking about . Opec increased production to make it worthless . Why??  I’ll tell you why . ISIS/ISIL. Reason? They were stealing oil & selling on black market @ 50% this is what funded terror there. By OPEC acting it was worthless overnight
4185 2018-02-25 21:51:26 I’ve totally heard that about coconut oil
4186 2018-02-25 21:51:12 What? GUYS, TRUMP IS GONNA LITERALLY POUR OIL IN THE OCEAN
4187 2018-02-25 21:51:07 40 minutes to carefully change oil - includes putting tools away but not time to take off muddy clothes. 
4188 2018-02-25 21:50:47 I’ve heard wonders about bio oil and I’m giving it a try as soon as I can get my hands on some!
4189 2018-02-25 21:50:45 Where on tv can u watch the Games? All of the Oil kings games Home and Away. Thanks. Mad that I cant Pvr it bec its not on shaw all the time...

4192 2018-02-25 21:50:30 I use 1/2 & 1/2 at home in my coffee, along w/ coconut oil as a sweetener.  
4193 2018-02-25 21:50:26 James has just pointed out that to make peanut butter all you need is peanuts, olive oil, and salt, he said loz he’s ready for a fight
4194 2018-02-25 21:50:19 Senator for Texas, Ted Cruz, accepts bribes of over $2.5 million from oil, gas and coal giants - destroying our future for a quick buck.

Payments to Ted Cruz:

Oil & Gas:  $2,465,910
Coal:  $103,900
Total:  $2,569,810
4195 2018-02-25 21:50:19 Then you must not have a career in government, finance or oil.  No point in arguing this.
4196 2018-02-25 21:50:16 The cleansing, healing oil of the Holy Spirit is applied to our hearts when we are hurt or wounded.
4197 2018-02-25 21:50:08 I know how weird this is but olive oil or coconut oil for removing make up. It does wonders for taking off waterproof mascara plus your skin feels super soft afterwards #GRLPOWR
4198 2018-02-25 21:50:02 Bath with some lavender oil! Works wonders and heating bags when you’re just sitting around
4199 2018-02-25 21:49:54 This shit plus green oil 
4200 2018-02-25 21:49:52 Having a spray bottle helps. That way you can mix water and some oil and leave in conditioner (or whatever products you use) and just spray your hair when it starts to feel dry
4201 2018-02-25 21:49:52 @realDonaldTrump Try Jamaican black castor oil for that bald spot Mr. President it works wonders...
4202 2018-02-25 21:49:47 Oooo that's a tough one! Maybe the coconut oil / lavender oil /tea tree oil that I mix together myself and use on a night #GRLPOWR
4203 2018-02-25 21:49:31 I'd be there with a roaster stick making "Smores" or jus toastin marshmallows 4 you....an if ur good girl...a total body massage, hot oil rub, etc....but I don't come cheap, you'd hav 2 supply the beer an chocolates
4204 2018-02-25 21:49:29 Although, credit where due, Jake Tapped was very tough with Sheriff Israel this morning.
4205 2018-02-25 21:49:16 部屋とワイシャツとオイル
4206 2018-02-25 21:48:56 I don't think the new guy realized my toothpicks have tea tree oil & cinnamon on them, so when he asked for one and used it, he was like "Whaaaat the sweet baby Jesus is on that?" 
4207 2018-02-25 21:48:54 Funny we discussed that. But want to perfect the dish before cooking for award winning restauranteurs 
#NotNervous
4208 2018-02-25 21:48:49 The Foret Precieuse clarifying facial oil by Daniele de Winter its pricey but the bottle lasts for ages and I only use it twice a week as a mini facial for my skin x x
4209 2018-02-25 21:48:36 Nice, seriously you just reminded me I need to change the oil and filter on my street triple.
4210 2018-02-25 21:48:35 @PontusAberg Welcome to the Oil!

4213 2018-02-25 21:48:24 This state is 2/3 Democrat. A Republican govonor will have to reverse course on off shore oil drilling. They will have realize that this state will fight any Republican attempt to change this stat’s values. This state has not had a Republican governor in decades.
4214 2018-02-25 21:48:11 Pfft! Goose fat is useless. Butter and vegetable oil far better
4215 2018-02-25 21:47:53 I made carrot oil today. It smells & feels so good on my skin! 
4216 2018-02-25 21:47:51 My man changes my oil for me 
4217 2018-02-25 21:47:50 Hate how dry my hair get  cant hold no type of oil or moisture for a day
4218 2018-02-25 21:47:39 Chips are perfect! Cut to them to an even size. I put them in a bag with a spoon of oil to coat then tip them into the hot fryer. 
Also seasoned sweet potato chips are great.
4219 2018-02-25 21:47:37 Oil studies diary: better than yesterday 
4220 2018-02-25 21:47:32 The USA has a finite amount of natural resources : fresh water for drinking and farming, farmable land, oil, etc. The more persons allowed to immigrate into the USA, the fewer natural resources there will be for each American, and the poorer the average American will be.
4221 2018-02-25 21:47:22 Showcasing him, teams need to know he's healthy for a trade.
4222 2018-02-25 21:47:08 The Royalty of the Victorian Era were Despots because they claimed their authority was 'divine'. Today our looters insult us with lines like 'Son/Daughter of Grace'.. 'Aniothing to receive oil bloc'. .. Balls in deed.
4223 2018-02-25 21:47:08 oil cleansing has helped my skin SO MUCH this winter! could not recommend it more! s/o obviously to my one source of all beauty-related info - my sister @madhu_gopalan
4224 2018-02-25 21:47:05 As does Johnson's baby oil!!!
4225 2018-02-25 21:47:01 Mom hit me with the “pay for your own oil change “

4227 2018-02-25 21:46:45 I’ve been thinking about being an adult and buying a new car since mine has an oil leak and sun roof leaks too but I get sad when I think about giving up my old one :(
4228 2018-02-25 21:46:44 Health Tips: keep your omega 3 oils(incl. fish oils)  in the freezer to keep fresh and reduce the fish oil repeating on you.
4229 2018-02-25 21:46:37 Do you have any oil brands in the game besides vp racing fuels?

4232 2018-02-25 21:45:56 Use Mac oil control under any foundation and you’re set
4233 2018-02-25 21:45:55 That's as good as it gets unfortunately. We all can't be oil paintings
4234 2018-02-25 21:45:50 Vibranium and coconut oil.
4235 2018-02-25 21:45:25 Was at @jiffylube for over an hour yesterday getting an oil change.  What took so long is they were trying to find something they could rip me off on.  Like a $360 loose serpentine belt, which wasn’t loose. 

JUST CHANGE THE OIL! #NeverAgain
4236 2018-02-25 21:45:09 Just throwin' a whole kilo of marihuana under the hood so I can get a little high when I change the oil.
4237 2018-02-25 21:45:04 #cooking question. Can vegetable oil be a substitute for canola oil in #baking if you don't have it?
4238 2018-02-25 21:44:57 @EPAScottPruitt Sunlight, wind, and water are also natural resources, and “harvesting” them for energy does less harm to our fellow man than coal and oil. Which do you think your god would prefer?  #renewables #solarpower #windpower #EPA
4239 2018-02-25 21:44:50 When your man changes your oil for you #Perksofhavingaboyfriend
4240 2018-02-25 21:44:47 I know you can put it in his mouth like mouthwash but he’s small so maybe just putting it right on the sores with a cotton swab and also putting coconut oil helps too you could put that on his diaper
4241 2018-02-25 21:44:33 If that’s the case, it’s time to invest in railway shares.  The oil WILL move, it’s just a question of how.
4242 2018-02-25 21:44:03 Please, Imo State Oil Producing Areas should be given due considered in sharing the dividends of NDDC.
4243 2018-02-25 21:44:03 Could be a problem...if anyone actually actually watched @cnn. But they are laser focused on propaganda and low ratings at the moment, so let them be.
4244 2018-02-25 21:43:57 #FakeOlympicsFacts the oil in the Olympic torch comes from used McDonald's french fryers.
4245 2018-02-25 21:43:45 We're on #SJSharks Team Total Under 2.5 -114 and #Yotes 1st Period Moneyline -107 tonight. Also lean Oilers/Ducks Under 5.5 but don't quite trust Al Montoya in net for the Oil.
4246 2018-02-25 21:43:32 Add mct oil and Irish butter to my coffee as well.
4247 2018-02-25 21:43:26 Time for an oil change... oooh, lordy! ＼(＾O＾)／

4249 2018-02-25 21:43:16 New Brunswick is an example of how tough it is to be a Canadian province without a major city or oil resources as an economic leader.

4252 2018-02-25 21:42:58 Shrink acne by placing a wrapped ice cube on it and leave it on the pimple for 3 minutes. Then cover it with a dab of lavender oil.
4253 2018-02-25 21:42:45 Love rapeseed oil but it is not healthier than butter, please enjoy both healthy fats in appropriate quantities
4254 2018-02-25 21:42:45 My car had no oil and I’ve been driving around like nothing I don’t check my car at all 
4255 2018-02-25 21:42:31 Not a huge deal, but it does keep the fermenting barrels from getting normal oil to refine, and the only way I've found to "fix" it is to break the fluid cables and put them back.
4256 2018-02-25 21:41:51 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.
4257 2018-02-25 21:41:51 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
4258 2018-02-25 21:41:46 “ but that 1:1 oil now that’s wild be careful “ 
4259 2018-02-25 21:41:46 Oil changed, car washed, and full tank
4260 2018-02-25 21:41:41 When you feed canola oil into the fermenting barrels, once the oil becomes Refined Canola Oil, if you oil generators are full, the refined oil will back up into the input fluid cable (which is supposed to push the normal oil into the fermenting barrel.

4264 2018-02-25 21:41:20 Hey David, my daughter told me to check out the movie 'Loving Vincent ', the first film using only oil paintings. It was great for Vincent fans. You'll recognize so many scenes.

4280 2018-02-25 21:39:17 Snake Oil Nitro Stout by Milwaukee Brewing Company found at Milwaukee Brewing Company. Gotta love it.
4281 2018-02-25 21:39:13 Thankyou Steven. As I cant see the twitter pictures. 
You know Heid gets a bit excited and doesnt like to miss out !!!!
4282 2018-02-25 21:39:13 So i tried olive oil on my dry face now
4283 2018-02-25 21:39:08 If the dip stick is saying its low on oil then yes it would be a good idea to top it up back into the normal range. Just keep checking it every week or so to make sure its not gone low
4284 2018-02-25 21:39:04 welcome to Oil Country!!
4285 2018-02-25 21:38:32 "Olive oil" lol. Gtfo
4286 2018-02-25 21:38:19 Controlled by OPEC . Increased production by them is what sets your prices per barrel here . You should know this. Texas has very little to do with it other than oil & gas fields . It’s not worth what it was thanks to other energy sources and increased Opec Production  Fact
4287 2018-02-25 21:38:12 Oh its a BMW one, sorry I thought you were talking about the old Morris/Austin/Rover Minis then yes I have heard of BMW ones losing/leaking oil also along with I think they're common for burning it quite a lot as well.
4288 2018-02-25 21:38:01 Agreed. But if it makes you happy Neil: all your success is hollow you are a fraud of a club. All built on foreign oil money and makes a mockery of the game. #netspend #oilcunts
4289 2018-02-25 21:37:51 I'm not disputing that. My problem is with saying oil is not dying. That is not true. If you consume more than you produce of anything, sooner or later you'll run out of it. So oil is really dying in a sense.
4290 2018-02-25 21:37:50 Extra spritz of oil shaken with soy sauce sorts that out!
4291 2018-02-25 21:37:47 i have oil in my head im so indian wow xd rawr
4292 2018-02-25 21:37:45 You don’t need a PHD to work that out. ‘My oil, my money’ is trying to extend Rwakitura dynasty.
4293 2018-02-25 21:37:30 I got rid of everything I had of his after he drove to Canada in his diesel spewing bus and knocked the Canadian oil sands while living a stone's throw away from one of the dirtiest places for oil, California.
4294 2018-02-25 21:37:26 Yes. I am making oatmeal for my dogs. I mix a can of wet food pet food in it and they love it. Healthy for them. Good fiber. I need to go back to adding olive oil to their food. It helps them go potty and helps moisturize their skin and coat.  Try it. 1 teaspoon per dog.
4295 2018-02-25 21:37:25 Buzz off. I know exactly what’s going on. The Alberta oil and gas industry is weak because of weak natural gas pricing. And the costs of drilling. A D&A well that cost $100,000 30 years ago is 4X that today. Gas prices aren’t 4X higher. The problems are...
4296 2018-02-25 21:37:21 Yes! Super easy. Melt coconut oil and poor over the popcorn and use sea/kosher salt. Shake and mix around.
4297 2018-02-25 21:37:08 Ima come down there one of these days after I get a oil change on my car, ima drop Jamar off and slide that way just to come for a lil & y'all can see fat
4298 2018-02-25 21:37:06 Mine is pores and break outs during PMS. Honest my pores are like canyons and I often use a pore minimising primer even without make up on but during totm I also get bad spots on my chin due to the excess oil x x
4299 2018-02-25 21:37:01 Maracuja oil, fenty foundation, or abh x amrezy highlighter 
4300 2018-02-25 21:37:01 We get alignments with our oil changes, we don’t have potholes we have craters, we don’t have roads we have trails, we have 2 seasons winter and construction Issa bitch
4301 2018-02-25 21:37:00 An oil and gas story - emoji style (feel free to add your own!) 
4302 2018-02-25 21:36:47 I'm PROUD/HAPPY for my LIFE's BLESSINGS, my right/left legs which moves,two eyes good hearing most of all a CLEAN PURE HEART.Those are what MONEY can't buy,I TRUST GOD!who GUIDES me 2 wholesome souls who cross may path .Evil is all around me? I #PRAY so OIL&WATER don't MIX at all
4303 2018-02-25 21:36:21 Where would city be without the oil money most likely in the championship so bought not won
4304 2018-02-25 21:36:00 Er its plain to see that WM has nearly bankrupted what was and still is an oil rich UK,they have failed on many levels compared to other countries like Norway ,Germany,scots can and will do MUCH better than that,it would`nt be hard after all
4305 2018-02-25 21:35:58 It struck me as suspiciously low. Even campaign contributions are dwarfed by say, the Insurance industry or Oil and Gas lobbying.
4306 2018-02-25 21:35:40 haha can you change my oil too. It really needs it
4307 2018-02-25 21:35:26 ありがとう〜〜！！
4308 2018-02-25 21:35:19 & it’s passed MOT with no advisories?? Like do you think there’s an issue with it being on low on oil after not being topped up since the last MOT
4309 2018-02-25 21:35:15 I take back any support for Milo Hippopopalous. He set off with noble goals but how much he's ruined himself is hilarious and the fact he's on Infowars peddling snake oil now is probably a fitting punishment. I still support his right to speak on campuses and thanks for GJP too.
4310 2018-02-25 21:35:15 I am sure the office of the national security adviser is located where there is oil spillage, if not why pay 1.1 billion to clean it, if it is not to save the environment.
4311 2018-02-25 21:35:08 How can anybody take you seriously when you lie, and look like an evil oil slick?  You exude blackness. That’s not a compliment.  NRA is ABSOLUTELY a lobby group.  Please go let your kids play with your guns now...
4312 2018-02-25 21:34:58 ONLY TRUE CURE is CBD oil w/THC!!! NOT DRUGS from THE USA DRUG PUSHER of GATEWAY DRUGS, which one ADVIODED BUT tRYED MANY different COCKTAILs WHICH REQUIRED more PILLS from VA & CAUSE me to be FELONEY ARRESTED BY CASPER POLICE BECAUSE i PUT the FEAR into WyHy EMPLOYEE!!!
4313 2018-02-25 21:34:33 It’s not old & it’s quite common for bmw minis to lose oil more than other cars, or so I’ve been told
4314 2018-02-25 21:34:24 You know those people who say #EVOO for extra virgin olive oil?

How should they be punished?
4315 2018-02-25 21:34:22 Yeeeeahhh!!! He loves me after all !!!
Follow Heid Adrian.....
4316 2018-02-25 21:34:16 Somethings should be common sense. If the oil company in polluting the bay, it should be shut down. That just seems like common sense.
4317 2018-02-25 21:34:13 I'd be okay with him in a coaching role for the Oil after his playing days.
4318 2018-02-25 21:34:00 Split the uk , how could a small country that only got oil , fishing , wind & wave power , whisky and a large food industry split a mighty country that's gone , er er what is it that you have exactly
4319 2018-02-25 21:33:48 Now I’m using Vichy cream cleanser and playing around with serums, moisturizer, face oil and above all eye cream #grlpowr
4320 2018-02-25 21:33:47 roubaram me os meus oil control papers e eu to mt putassa
4321 2018-02-25 21:33:41 As the law stands it's legal persons, which includes registered companies and institutions.
Don't panic, the words right after "right to enjoy one's property" include also "obligations" to others in that use. Oil giants omitted that tho...
4322 2018-02-25 21:33:41 The answer is no it shouldn't lose a lot of oil, but if its old then theres a good chance a leak has developed or the engine might be burning oil due to its age
4323 2018-02-25 21:33:40 lol, sugar. Texas conservative and strong. Don't quit your day joy. Gas and oil keep prices competitive.
4324 2018-02-25 21:33:35 Coconut oil is heaven
4325 2018-02-25 21:33:21 3-0 Oilers. Not sure who put it in.
4326 2018-02-25 21:33:18 You need to tag him in the tweet Heid. @Adrianwfire will you follow Heid pls.
4327 2018-02-25 21:33:09 Changing the oil on a Prius is like rolling a D20. It may be okay but then again, it could just be awful...
4328 2018-02-25 21:33:06 Sitting in Walmart waiting for an oil change. The only bench is in the toy section.
Now I must decide what's better.

Walking around the store.
Or sitting listening to kids throw tantrums because they can't get a toy. 
Like one every 3 minutes.
4329 2018-02-25 21:33:05 Idk why I never used a face oil under my highlight ... @AmandaEnsing girlllll good lookin’
4330 2018-02-25 21:32:38 I TRIED CLOVE OIL ON MY WISDOM TEETH SO THEYD STOP HURTING AND NO IT TASTES HORRIBLE DONT DO IT
4331 2018-02-25 21:32:30 It should for sure look like mayo. You’re prob adding the oil too quickly. Lately I’ve been using a hand immersion blender and it works every time.
4332 2018-02-25 21:32:28 see I saw that online but the lil dude was suffering so much that we just wanted it to be over and didn’t have time for getting clove oil 
4333 2018-02-25 21:32:19 Also not enough olive oil and needs to be preheated. Garlic and rosemary goes into water to infuse the potato.
4334 2018-02-25 21:32:18 Spilling while changing oil is my biggest annoyance. I hate it.
4335 2018-02-25 21:32:18 like 8 samosas deep, waiting for all this oil to come n kick my a$$ 
4336 2018-02-25 21:32:13 Do you think Islam is not a Western phenomenon? To contain oil? Control the price? Selling weapons?
4337 2018-02-25 21:32:08 So where’s our invite? Lost in the post? 
4338 2018-02-25 21:32:03 Best olive oil you can get
4339 2018-02-25 21:31:55 Dad helped me fix my oil instead of taking it to a place. We (he) broke off a part of my oil filter canister. Might not be able to drive to work or school tomorrow. So glad we saved the 30-40 dollars
4340 2018-02-25 21:31:29 Long nat gas, long bonds, short oil, short equities are my key trading themes in the coming week.
4341 2018-02-25 21:31:12 a freezer is the tooth of an organisation
a lovelorn stepdaughter is an oil of the abortion
4342 2018-02-25 21:31:09 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
4343 2018-02-25 21:31:03 And if you can please tell me who is finding and running that operation, I would be eternally grateful. I bet it's big oil. All that equipment, unlimited budget, floating in every ocean.
4344 2018-02-25 21:31:00 so you poured olive oil on the stairs just in case? smart move.
4345 2018-02-25 21:30:51 WELCOME TO OIL COUNTRY PONTUS!!!!!!!!
4346 2018-02-25 21:30:42 No, it's 100% the paint. But also my flip flops had zero traction. They might as well had oil bottoms lol.
4347 2018-02-25 21:30:17 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
4348 2018-02-25 21:30:12 Oilers go up 2-0 on a PP goal by Harding.  to Kemkarann-Humble.
4349 2018-02-25 21:29:36 Just heard that someone is buying a pile of old oil to paint their fence at home.. are we still doing this in 2018? 
4350 2018-02-25 21:29:28 Gorsuch should be No. 1, unless you're just talking about his cabinet.

4354 2018-02-25 21:28:09 TwitterPals, does anyone know where I can buy peppermint oil?  Rather a t a store than Amazon but will order there if I have too!  Thanks
4355 2018-02-25 21:27:58 When your "god" is the oil & gas lobby it's believable
4356 2018-02-25 21:27:54 yeah, I've never liked mayo, but I feel like I could just eat avocado oil mayo with a spoon
4357 2018-02-25 21:27:49 Ooooh v intrigued I’m using the night oil from @Caudalie (bless french skincare)
4358 2018-02-25 21:27:42 Those who carry oil war in the Middle East. They are more dangerous
4359 2018-02-25 21:27:40 Hope that you've all got your heating oil ordered in readiness for this cold snap.
4360 2018-02-25 21:27:24 Beard bros wash, and butter. Then i have cremo beard oil. Then of course the boar bristle brush
4361 2018-02-25 21:27:16 El-Kamour sit-inners protesting again in the center of the city of #Tataouine. The promises of the #TnGov that ended the 3-months sit-in at the oil pumping station were not fulfilled. If the agreement of June16 is not executed within 1 week, they will go back to El-Kamour.
4362 2018-02-25 21:27:13 They are different. You don’t make pancake batter the same way you make waffle batter. They call for different amounts of water, egg, & oil. Which causes them to taste different & have different textures
4363 2018-02-25 21:27:03 Is this with oil paint?
4364 2018-02-25 21:26:59 Whisk egg yolk with a tablespoon of olive oil and leave on hair for a few minutes before your shampoo. It makes a great hair conditioner.
4365 2018-02-25 21:26:52 Why is the places where Diamonds and Oil come from are people driven away from their home, War is the Norm  And those people are most Discriminated Against Jesus Take Wheel......
4366 2018-02-25 21:26:38 Have you? I couldn’t praise it enough. I use palmers oil I love it, a new brand I’ve been testing @urbanveda also have skin oils and they’ve got dif types to match different skins, you have to answer questions to find your match, I might give that a go soon to review! x x x
4367 2018-02-25 21:26:31 Olive oil or elo pupa? Yinmu, you want to mention your customers?
4368 2018-02-25 21:26:16 You need @FuelTool, Rachel. Price comparison site for heating oil. Competitive and great service.
4369 2018-02-25 21:26:00 As the polar ice recedes, synergistic opportunity abounds: newly uncovered oil deposits can power offshore mining clusters, resulting in more warming and new oil strikes!  Foolproof!  We’ll all be rich!  Money will be just a number, and the number will be infinity!
4370 2018-02-25 21:25:34 I have no doubt you are a paid Gore worker but go ahead carry on with the snake oil science and roll out more shills from this multi billion dollar gov funded scam.
4371 2018-02-25 21:25:30 Truffle oil is a game changer

4374 2018-02-25 21:24:57 EU should ban palm oil
4375 2018-02-25 21:24:52 Oilers open the scoring. Amyotte from Flanagan. 1-0 Oilers.
4376 2018-02-25 21:24:52 duh. "methinks the lady doth protest too much" and all that.
4377 2018-02-25 21:24:50 Is this the same UK that takes nearly all of the oil and gas revenue which when combined with scots other exports is too much for westminster to lose,
is it that UK?,same UK that tried to hide brexit?,why would we want to stay with that UK?
4378 2018-02-25 21:24:50 The effects of CBD oil are real. 
However, any product using someone famous acting as a spokesman on an infomercial is questionable.

@BillGates  Care to comment? 
You really doing infomercials now?

4383 2018-02-25 21:24:32 lol yessss. try coconut oil also.
4384 2018-02-25 21:24:26 I just recently discovered face oil and it’s been such a game changer for me
4385 2018-02-25 21:24:24 I've always voted for the person over the party as well & I continue to do that! I used to vote 4 GOP but they were 4 workers I'm talking the late 60's! They once could police themselves had a moral compass but no more! Sure the Dems accept money! LBJ was an oil man! The ? Is

4387 2018-02-25 21:24:09 fair enough.... no oil revenues, no whisky revenues, no electricity sent down.  No scallops, salmon, langoustines ..... i could go on..... but why should I.

4392 2018-02-25 21:22:44 Never going to @Walmart for another Oil Change !
4393 2018-02-25 21:22:37 They just want their enemies fighting each other so they don't band together to fight the elites. Money they get from oil, they don't need the U.S. taxpayer for it.
4394 2018-02-25 21:22:34 The ranchers the BLM the oil cronies people rolling in money ought to be ashamed of themselves for what they have done to our HISTORIC ICONIC wild horses & burros. These people should lose their jobs for all their lies, lying to the Congress & Senators. Zinke should lose his too.
4395 2018-02-25 21:22:08 Coconut oil!!
4396 2018-02-25 21:22:07 That feeling when you realize that people you thought you were 'influencing" find out you are nothing but a huckster after all. No one buying the snake oil any more, Mona?
4397 2018-02-25 21:22:03 He knelt next down the bath and muttered something in Old Norse. It would activate the runic bath oil, which should speed up the healing.

He then grabbed a sponge and some soap and carefully began to wash his lover.
4398 2018-02-25 21:21:39 The revelations bath oil! It was lovely 
4399 2018-02-25 21:21:22 I just polished a plant with coconut oil as directed by the person who sold it to me and that was a whole experience.

4402 2018-02-25 21:21:07 I live in Pennsylvania, but gorillas don’t live in the US, they live in forests that are being ripped down for palm oil which is used in almost everything along with leopards, Jaguars, orangutans, and many other animals.
4403 2018-02-25 21:20:45 the recipe i use is really hecking easy (yeast, water, olive oil, white beans, rye flour and regular flour) so i’ll prob stick w it for a while but i want to try more!! it’s relaxing and makes you feel accomplished w minimal effort. also smells and tastes better than storebought.

4434 2018-02-25 21:17:47 Pls let Angel go home next week so he can go and complete his Mobile phone company, oil mogul, beat maker. #BBNaija
4435 2018-02-25 21:17:44 Chef Skinner cut up some rotten zucchini, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was 1000 rat corpses, along with Play-Doh.
4436 2018-02-25 21:17:32 Bell was a government granted monopoly, yes. And SO was no monopoly. It got a leading market position by vastly decreasing the price of oil, bringing light and heat to the masses for far cheaper than before. When broken up it's market share had been dwindling for some time.
4437 2018-02-25 21:17:32 is it dry skin?? my boxer gets crazy dry skin on his nose that my grandma uses coconut oil or aloe on and it goes away especially during this dry weather

$$$ from his old Suitors in the Oil & Gas Industry help fill the Coffers, as well.
4440 2018-02-25 21:17:28 Listen, you don't know real pleasure until you've rubbed down your whole body with olive oil every day for a week. I'm melting down here
4441 2018-02-25 21:17:20 10x the player. Faster better hands and shoots better. Could be a steal for the oil

4445 2018-02-25 21:16:16 When the cougars follow the bottle of oil, it is because they think Negru sausage will be thrown into the laundry room.
4446 2018-02-25 21:16:01 yes, castor oil is used a lot in Jamaica for hair care as well for keeping you regular and getting rid of body toxins such as worms etc. My hubby is from Jamaica and always tells tales of how he was forced to drink it as a child. i will stick to using it on my hair!
4447 2018-02-25 21:16:01 I saw an interesting picture of what your stomach looks like with 400 calories of veggies in it vs 400 calories of chicken or oil. Veggies, full stomach. Chicken or oil, less than 15% full.

4451 2018-02-25 21:15:17 Now that we have 45 Billion dollars on our foregn reserve and oil over 60 dollar
Do we have a reason to continue with PDP failed idea?
Should we be raising #100BillioSukukBound & spending all of it on road project that can not even pay back D debt?
A factory will pay back D debt
4452 2018-02-25 21:15:13 Hey @joerogan what company do you recommend for cbd oil? I didn't see an option on the Onnit website. I have to pass a thc test for my job so please keep that in mind.

4455 2018-02-25 21:15:00 Sometimes you just gotta do an oil change yourself lol
4456 2018-02-25 21:14:49 Yes! Essential oil’s can last forever so your bottle should be good for 10+ years!
4457 2018-02-25 21:14:47 Never again, ISIS collaborators, Oil thieves, murderers of Kurdish women fighters.

4468 2018-02-25 21:12:23 One way or the other that oil is coming out
4469 2018-02-25 21:12:22 If you've got it, flaunt it.
4470 2018-02-25 21:12:22 In #YYC we go through boom and bust house prices varying on  oil prices. I consider it a good time to buy with rents out pacing mortgage costs or similar and oil trending up. When oil heats up the high end housing market gains the most/lost the most.
4471 2018-02-25 21:12:16 #WeekendUpdate #SundayMorning 
1.  Market pull back with $SPY diving down due to rally in $DXY and fed unwinding balance sheet 
2.  With #Gold and #Oil also being correlated to $DXY these likely to pull back too
3.  #NatGas stop loss hunt possible to 2.51 but 2.78-2.90 on deck
4472 2018-02-25 21:12:13 average of 2 oil spills or leaks per day in Alberta no-one can say the risk is infinitesimal. Like I said clean up the 220 sq kilometers of tailing ponds (your description of a very small area) 1st and we may begin to believe in a commitment to keep B.C. clean til then no chance
4473 2018-02-25 21:12:00 I rubbed coconut oil on it. [to my wife] Do you like penis coladas
4474 2018-02-25 21:11:56 I'm embarrassed to admit I live in his constituency of Oak Bay. I think he tries to get away with whatever drivel he can muster. You'd be surprised how many people here think they could live without oil.

4478 2018-02-25 21:10:42 Cant tell from this footage, but I would bet natural gas or propane, heating oil is involved in this. That or someone blew themselves up.

4483 2018-02-25 21:09:53 You know how medical professionals are always asking if you're allergic to anything?  I always say "no," because I'm not.  But I think I'll start saying "peppermint oil."

4487 2018-02-25 21:09:25 Dead on in terms of markets.  Sign of the times.  Yet, the 'puppet regime' continues to go with oil.  There must be quite a bit of crossover investment between corporate, bonds, and other financials.
4488 2018-02-25 21:09:22 I wash, moisturise, brush, condition then add coconut oil
4489 2018-02-25 21:08:27 Strange technology... it’s really worked? I mean energy storages, what is that - brine, or some oil, what is that?
4490 2018-02-25 21:08:13 Nothing on global tariff free trade just silly points of empire and snake oil.

4494 2018-02-25 21:07:18 Omg this oil is giving me life
4495 2018-02-25 21:07:16 Oil glistened, fingers manipulated, kisses seized.
4496 2018-02-25 21:07:08 Not everyone can be gold. Despite what the UK Sport funders might think.
4497 2018-02-25 21:07:01 when you get out the shower and you've put on your sweet almond oil and shea butter and your skin is looking like an actual bar of chocolate. brooooo.
4498 2018-02-25 21:06:51 There's no such thing as a free oil change

4500 2018-02-25 21:06:33 Brexiteers can't even adapt to the loss of empire. Face it, after the indulgence of the transition period ends the Brexiteers would be found out for the self serving snake oil merchants they've always been.
4501 2018-02-25 21:06:22 It may be that much like a young duck in an oil spill, you are simply too young and naieve to see the culture of Democratic misinformation and deception in which you have become mired, even as its poison sucks the life out of you.
4502 2018-02-25 21:06:08 Can you sir please explain to me how a civil servant that he was amassed so much wealth. Do you know what it means to be a honest civil servant in Nigeria? It means you may never rich, at most comfortable. But Atiku owns oil wells.i need an explanation for his wealth.
4503 2018-02-25 21:06:06 Frying food with oil in a pan is a terrifying experience and I do not recommend it if you can avoid it.
4504 2018-02-25 21:05:46 Some sounds just sound amazing sipping oil
4505 2018-02-25 21:05:44 @MikhilaMcDaid please help! A great dupe for Ester Lauder advanced night time oil? I got a few samples & it’s amazing for my skin. My skin is dry&oily,grey looking & just ‘meh’ I love oils. I’m going back through all your videos be had I swear you use oil somewhere?! Please help

4510 2018-02-25 21:04:46 I give him canna companion which is hemp oil. His tumor has shrunk so much 
4511 2018-02-25 21:04:36 I needed an oil change
4512 2018-02-25 21:04:25 For the exact same reason we didn't invade them after Bush found out they were largely responsible for 9/11,we get mucho oil from them. Iran and Iraq were never about anything but fake revenge and oil. They were/are not our allies so it didn't hurt us. Going after Saudi's= NO OIL
4513 2018-02-25 21:04:23 Nice tardis

4517 2018-02-25 21:03:41 With the way Chelsea are going down, they'll discover oil soon
4518 2018-02-25 21:03:29 We were going to do fish oil but then I read somewhere it's not good for Smokeys cancer there might be mercury??
4519 2018-02-25 21:03:17 Brian's spitting some hot fire with all that OIL IN HIS VEINS.
4520 2018-02-25 21:03:11 And that is a generous assessment; many ‘startup consultants’ take advantage of target clients’ lack of experience/knowledge. And don’t focus on experienced/corporate sector given the harder it is to sell snake oil. Not all, which is unfortunate for those with good intentions.
4521 2018-02-25 21:03:03 We don’t rely on their oil smh. We get most of our imported oil from Canada and Mexico

4528 2018-02-25 21:02:24 If you’re spreading your oil to make it look gold or some what see through because it’s black then that shits BOOF and nothing will change the fact that the shits BOOF

4534 2018-02-25 21:01:16 But just to end this on a constructive note, why don't you share a link for where you think IEA has shown the right distribution (presumably using final energy) across all energy sources from oil, gas, and coal to hydro, nuclear, solar PV, wind, geothermal etc.?
THANKS!
4535 2018-02-25 21:01:05 
4536 2018-02-25 21:01:02 Shut your trap about suffering. I own oil and gas assets so I think I probably know better than u and need no lectures. It isn’t that I don’t support pipelines or the general health of the oil industry. It’s that Kenney is a little man with a big mouth who is unhelpful. #cdnpoli
4537 2018-02-25 21:01:01 Sad thing, if there was any EU/US leadership on this, Turkey would back down. Putin is laughing all the way to his election others doing his work for him. Seems like all leaders care about is Turkish arms contracts and oil pipes.
4538 2018-02-25 21:01:01 "Love cannot endure indifference It needs to be wanted Like a lamp, it needs to be fed out of the oil of another's heart, or its flame burns low"
4539 2018-02-25 21:00:51 And even the if not is a bit complicated. If national carbon intensity goes up b c of strong rebound in oil prices and recovery on oil patch, that too is overall good for Canada.
4540 2018-02-25 21:00:46 Stir together 2 tablespoons chips with 2 cups green beans. Add generous amounts of Olive Oil. Freeze for 9 hours. Serve to your worst enemy.
4541 2018-02-25 21:00:39 Ugh I Still Gotta Get My Oil Changed , And Pack For In The Morning .
4542 2018-02-25 21:00:24 Did the vet say to add fish oil? I add it in as I serve it. I also make it with turkey. 
Mine love it too. 
4543 2018-02-25 21:00:11 You stated that borrowing to invest was normal, I have pointed out that, that did not always give successful outcomes. The Wilson Government being a prime example. You then made incorrect statements regarding the ‘crash in oil prices’.
4544 2018-02-25 20:59:58 Fool on the Hill ....follow me!!!!!!.........
4545 2018-02-25 20:59:36 Coconut oil hybrid is a good alternative. Also, some of the higher-end water-based gel lubes with higher viscosity.
4546 2018-02-25 20:59:12 At least we get to laugh at them! I know it doesn't compensate for the pollution etc but we have to draw positives out of a negative situation. I am no expert but I would have thought the pollution from fuel and oil would be minimal especially from a brand spanking range rover

4549 2018-02-25 20:58:53 The oil they use to make it is found in rainforests where they live. So they destroy there homes and kill some 
4550 2018-02-25 20:58:45 Has anyone tried an air fryer for making chips? I miss my deep fat fryer but thought that might be easier to clean with no oil to dispose of

4552 2018-02-25 20:58:34 Every time i try to put essential oil in my humidifier I always put way too much and my room smells like a hippie farted in there for like 3 days and it gets onto my clothes and plz help meeeeeee
4553 2018-02-25 20:58:28 I mean they can't wait till the absolute end of fuel. It now seems like oil will last until 2052 and you obviously can't change F1 into something like Formula E in a month time.
4554 2018-02-25 20:58:25 What do you do with the oil??
4555 2018-02-25 20:58:13 Yes and there are other issues for example acid/metallurgy. But I think it is fair to say that diluted bitumen is far more similar to conventional heavy oil that is is different, contrary to general public perception of it being a entirely different category of feedstock.
4556 2018-02-25 20:58:06 You have nothing to say worth listening to. You exposed to everyone what you really are by accepting a role on the oil sands advisory panel in Alberta. It isn’t pretty. Just disgraceful. Who pays you now?

4559 2018-02-25 20:57:50 Damn straight the smart is betting on the opposite. Inflation is likely to roll over alongside oil prices. Which is likely to cause interest rates to fall. Treasuries will likely go up financials will go down. What is so hard to figure out here.

4561 2018-02-25 20:57:31 Oh yeah... sure... He issued a secret executive order for that. Right... And we struck oil at Mount Rushmore. Why are you stirring up this shit, speaking as if you know. GOP had 6 years in charge of Congress under him. Don't you think they would have ordered an investigation?
4562 2018-02-25 20:57:26 Roasted with olive oil and sea salt - amazing!
4563 2018-02-25 20:57:25 Most of the tech bubble was snake oil bullshit as well. I'm still glad it happened.
4564 2018-02-25 20:57:19 Is that 93% of Trump supporters? Or did they just poll the NRA and big oil? Deluded you are my little orange friend!! :-) #trumpton needs a straight jacket, he has lost his mind!

4567 2018-02-25 20:56:26 last night i was talking abt how bad i feel abt only using my olive oil for removing makeup but i just found out that u use Variois Oils to make seasoning stick to air popped popcorn and i finally have a use for it!

4569 2018-02-25 20:56:19 Wirth thinking about getting the unit that automatically sends a message to your oil company requesting a fill-up?
4570 2018-02-25 20:56:06 And you can't compare oil company workers to nysc staff. The wage discrepancy is crazy.

4573 2018-02-25 20:55:59 I hate waiting for oil changes  but I love knowing that it’s taken care of
4574 2018-02-25 20:55:43 Counterpoint: most of what was done in the 20s was snake oil bullshit and the real innovations of the 20th century (as they usually do) came from internecine conflict
4575 2018-02-25 20:55:23 Stovetop mac is toddler food yeah but I mean baked mac and cheese with truffle oil and panko breaded top with a tangy sweet glaze drizzled on top and a side of tender grilled brussel sprouts is dope adult food tho.
4576 2018-02-25 20:54:47 Yes, Standard Oil and the Bell System were made by government, which is why government developed antitrust legislation to dismantle them...

Sorry, but we're not a lot alike. I'm a statist because I prefer the mandate of the people over the "invisible hand of the free market."
4577 2018-02-25 20:54:42

4580 2018-02-25 20:53:53 Half truth...yes it was spent but not because if pipelines. Most canadian oil needs dilution with light crude because its so heavy

4587 2018-02-25 20:52:33 KM is a TEXAS based co owned by Enron execs that want to ship raw bitumen thru the Salish sea to refineries in Asia. Blockaders are regular folks who care about climate/salmon/orcas/FN rights. Only thing sad + disappointing is your shilling for big oil
4588 2018-02-25 20:52:18 @GNev2 breath in through your nose, out through your mouth while closing your eyes. Add frankincense oil to hot water and sniff relax x
4589 2018-02-25 20:52:04 Alberta should build large catapults to propel barrels of oil over to the coast.
4590 2018-02-25 20:51:57 Joining the NRA is like joining a giant lobby at this point. He might as well give your money to Big Oil since all it's going to be used for is corrupting our politicians to write laws that don't suit its people.
4591 2018-02-25 20:51:36 Oil changes are so expensive  I’m about to diy my next one
4592 2018-02-25 20:51:26 Omgg that’s terrible. I had to put one of mine down with clove oil. It’s a anesthetic for fish
4593 2018-02-25 20:51:08 ^MC Before You Beg For The End of Oil Consider This

Those that want to ban it will be shocked by Mike's list of products from the 6,000 that are made from crude oil!
4594 2018-02-25 20:51:00 The separator element prevents the excessive use of oil, but it has to be replaced periodically. Keep your compressor in top condition by replacing the separator element every 1,000 hours of operation.

4595 2018-02-25 20:50:57 thanks for reading and for dropping by to say so! I originally wrote Gray as a single long novel in 2005 and when Kindle happened and I decided to self-publish, I rewrote and expanded it. Just finished proofreading Oil 4 today and want to do a spin-off series of it next year.

4597 2018-02-25 20:50:53 This morning I put what I thought was leave in conditioner in my hair, turns out it was pure coconut oil and now my hair looks super gross, I love my life :)
4598 2018-02-25 20:50:39 I think the peels did lighten my current acne scars a little but no major changes so far :( It’s hard to fade them completely. I heard tamanu oil does work tho
4599 2018-02-25 20:50:14 Regular face washing. Wash your face any chance you get. tea tree oil is good too. Don’t use soaps that are harsh on your face cos your face will just get irritated and it would make it worse. Use a mild soap.
4600 2018-02-25 20:50:07 Why would they dress Maroon tonight? How about be smart like the other teams and sit the players likely to be on the move.. lol Oilers gonna Oil.
4601 2018-02-25 20:49:59 In Nigeria, oil wells don't get allocated to people/businesses they get allocated to states. What is allocated to people or businesses is oil lease (prospecting or mining)...

4605 2018-02-25 20:49:47 Your saying those weapons should only be used for invading a country for oil and not for Americans at home to defend?
4606 2018-02-25 20:49:46 I’ve never heard that, but the dish soap kills the bacteria and the olive oil conditions the brush to keep it soft!
4607 2018-02-25 20:49:43 That shit show tonight wasn't even about oil money
4608 2018-02-25 20:49:36 So God’s words are “Snake oil” to you. And bc I quote the Bible I’m a nut according to you.
4609 2018-02-25 20:49:35 Rachel how many times have I told you order the bleeding oil it’s not difficult
4610 2018-02-25 20:49:27 @BillGates As you may know, people can't eat or breath money. Only food or oxygen are appropriate 4 us. Palm oil companies are destroying O2
4611 2018-02-25 20:49:18 Idk why, but I love the smell of Jamaican Black castor oil.
4612 2018-02-25 20:49:11 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
4613 2018-02-25 20:48:55 I’ve also heard of vinegar and dish soap, is there much of a difference between that and olive oil?
4614 2018-02-25 20:48:23 Q3 Personal and kit I want product geared towards sensitive skin; not a lot of actives - particularly not acids, not a lot of fragrance, and hydrating without a lot of oil (some oil is OK but not heavy oils). #BBT

4618 2018-02-25 20:47:42 Also, I’ve used Beauty Blender’s solid soap, but olive oil and dish soap is a cost efficient and highly recommended option as well!
4619 2018-02-25 20:47:38 First time I've ever seen someone order a side of coconut oil. Only here man.
4620 2018-02-25 20:47:28 The only productive thing that I've done today is oil my scalp.
4621 2018-02-25 20:47:26 The 2017 report features the happiness score averaged over the years 2014-2016. For that timespan, Norway is the overall happiest country in the world, even though oil prices have dropped. Close behind are Denmark, Iceland and Switzerland in a tight pack.

4624 2018-02-25 20:47:16 Not sure any amount of money can over come "No oil! No Straws! No genders! No jobs!" Here in Texas. 

Movies don't put bread on these tables.
4625 2018-02-25 20:47:11 For $160 you can get 11 Essential oils, a diffuser, 10 sample oil packets, 10 sample bottles. Ask me howwww 
4626 2018-02-25 20:47:04 Yeah, county fairs prove that you can deep fry *anything*. We'll be seeing deep fried oil soon, I'm sure!
4627 2018-02-25 20:46:56 @BillGates Rain forests are the primary source of Oxygen and Palm oil companies are destroying them. Countries of Asia and South America...
4628 2018-02-25 20:46:27 It can be depending on what oil you use, what breading and what your actually frying. I eat keto and have lost 90 pounds in the last few years and still eat stuff fried, just use a healthy oil and i don’t bread it with flour.
4629 2018-02-25 20:46:11 "meh" is a gross mischaracterization.
4630 2018-02-25 20:46:06 Se cuecen los huevos. Se hacen rodajas de tomate; un poco de oliva oil, sal. Y yummy. Super yummy
4631 2018-02-25 20:45:20 Here I am preaching #woke!  Shame on me. I meant cassava cake, soybean oil and leek seeds.
4632 2018-02-25 20:45:06 Ben, from a refining perspective, diluted bitumen and conventional heavy oil are very similar.  Refineries that can process conventional heavy oil (lots of them globally) are generally positioned to process diluted bitumen.  Alberts upgraders are just specialized refining units.
4633 2018-02-25 20:45:05 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
4634 2018-02-25 20:44:45 @BillGates We most protect our Rain #forests from #Palm #oil companies cause they are destroying them all over the world. And, only 4 money

4636 2018-02-25 20:44:36 she would kiss the ass of this greedy, corrupt shill for the oil companies.  how would these two like to go live in a house where oil companies started fracking with nothing they could do about it and then see a big, toxic oil sludge all over the yard?
4637 2018-02-25 20:44:34 I can't stop thinking of the feeling of that vitamine d oil in my mouth
I hate this D:
4638 2018-02-25 20:44:23 They bought the snake oil and are surprised it doesn't cure cancer. Millions of us saw the snake oil salesman for what he is: a huckster. But the buyer's remorse is real and painful. I welcome them to #Resist
4639 2018-02-25 20:44:10 In this present government over 10000 people lost their jobs and I am talking oil company jobs oh, believe me a minimum wage collecting Nysc staff doesn't survive on their salary, and they can always be integrated elsewhere where.
4640 2018-02-25 20:44:05 It said on the outside "liquid eggs". It looked like an oil tanker!
4641 2018-02-25 20:43:46 Ahh dearfeeling any betta? Olibas oil is great . Hot lemonade & honey. Do hope it hasn't got a good hold on you. Big hugs Michaellots of love 
4642 2018-02-25 20:43:37 And thats because its a war that was started under bush for the oil. There is no need in it. Again obama kept military funded 600 to 700 billion each year.
4643 2018-02-25 20:43:31 on top of everyone else's suggestions, not long ago I discovered avocado oil mayo and suddenly realized I like mayo
4644 2018-02-25 20:43:29 If you do(i can give you a list of what to get) be cautious and research each oil because some are harmful to cats. You can get some good deals on amazon.
4645 2018-02-25 20:43:28 Oil tanks on the slopes of a mtn that will be hit by an 8+ Richter quake is insane. Having said that, I won't blame you for bowing out. It's a losing game. AB+Feds will get the pipe built.  Imo, negotiating an alternative route would have made more impact than obstructionism.
4646 2018-02-25 20:43:20 @kufre_ed how far G, oil money don block ur rear view Sotey u no dey see ur boy. Epp my Epp sir.
4647 2018-02-25 20:43:09 I really couldn't disagree more. Why would you be against a renewable resource? Passive energy sources can't meet the peaks of energy consumption on their own so oil, gas and uranium are the alternatives you are lobbying for.

4652 2018-02-25 20:42:47 I used to eat lots of flaxseed and buy a lit of flaxseed oil. Flaxseed is indigestable so you don't contact with the oil. And if you buy a bottle it's often oxidized even in the supermarket, unlike omega 6 oils. So to my mind it might be even worse and cause more inflammation.
4653 2018-02-25 20:42:44 @LouCadle just finished the Gray trilogy - fantastic read and an awesome story, can’t wait to start on the Oil books 
4654 2018-02-25 20:42:41 One of my favorite feelings is getting out of a hot & relaxing shower, putting coconut oil on my legs, moisturizing my face, putting on comfy pjs & getting in bed. Literally nothing beats it 
4655 2018-02-25 20:42:32 Stop using palm oil!
4656 2018-02-25 20:42:03 Shame on you. Should be couscous, lavender essence and extra virgin avocado oil. PETA is coming for you!
4657 2018-02-25 20:41:34 CBD oil too

Who are the FSA? why is the US military occupying the syrian oil fields? why isn't the MSM talking about Syria? calm before the storm? no war with NK? is the deep state shifting focus back to the middle east? what about Bibi?

4663 2018-02-25 20:40:50 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
4664 2018-02-25 20:40:48 I am pretty sure that if liberals rip the kid who said CNN was scripted, they'll get a pass. Better not make criticize the anti gun kids tho.
4665 2018-02-25 20:40:47 I just remembered that a guy I went on a few dates with kept his olive oil in his fridge and just how WEIRD that is.

4673 2018-02-25 20:40:06 It’s never an accident w/ him. He went on Alex Jones’s show and in essence legitimized him, to little pushback in US media and the tacit OK from the #GOP. IMO #Trump is the quintessential carnival barker/huckster, in the tradition of the Old West, a political snake oil salesman.
4674 2018-02-25 20:39:48 Had a 330 petrol before it, but couldn't live with 19 mpg!! So it had too go, this oil burner does high 40's and it's quick enough for our cart tracks round here!

4680 2018-02-25 20:39:06 Suave Naturals shampoo and conditioner for color treated hair. I shampoo about every 3rd or 4th time in shower. Aveda curly leave in product. Deep condition every 2-3 weeks with coconut or olive oil. Kiss ass colorist.

4687 2018-02-25 20:38:22 I cannot tell you how hard I try switching him over to coconut oil, he refuses. I got black bean hummus and he gave me a stank ass face, but ate nearly all of it by the time I was done putting the groceries away.
4688 2018-02-25 20:38:10 You can also give him boiled eggs and cottage cheese (if he tolerates milk products, but Labradors usually do) with a little oil.
4689 2018-02-25 20:38:06 To torture the gun analogy some more, the snake oil salesperson deceives cancer patient into believing s/he should be brave enough, have enough faith, to use squirt gun against 'the bad guy' with the AR-15.

4706 2018-02-25 20:35:46 No but a horse rider could fit their horse with a bun catcher like they have to by law elsewhere in the world. Cars have catalytic converters if they leaked oil, your fined. If you lose part of an unsecured load your fined

4712 2018-02-25 20:34:52 Bah, sorry, one more rambling: It’s particularly apropos that the look of the shimmer is more oil-on-water than rainbow, since the mechanism of that phenomenon is a bit different than rainbows and has to do with the same beam of light being split and interfering with itself.
4713 2018-02-25 20:34:47 Disappointing result in the cup final, serious smell of oil from wembley all the same
4714 2018-02-25 20:34:45 What I do is soak them in baby oil/water with soft soap for 10-20 minutes and then run them in my hand and all the dirt will come off much easier

4739 2018-02-25 20:32:23 The giveaway was the money allocated to update the port but nothing for updating the refinery. That says it all.

4743 2018-02-25 20:31:36 Roughly 1/3 of natural gas use in New England is for residential heating. Synapse has looked at transitioning from oil & gas heating to heat pumps.

4750 2018-02-25 20:30:02 To select a healthy cooking oil, look for expeller- pressed or cold-pressed oils to ensure you are buying high-quality, undamaged oil. Oi...
4751 2018-02-25 20:29:52 The difference is that in Norway they make the policies due to oil and gas money shared by s small population. In the U.K. the situation is different - much higher population with negligible income from gas. Only an idiot would believe all promises Corbyn makes in this country.

4779 2018-02-25 20:25:43 These are the type of decisions needed to help the world retreat from the point of no return. Ireland may consider advocating the adoption of policies that would deter the use of energy extracted from oil sands to help Canada make sounder long-term decisions.
4780 2018-02-25 20:25:33 I included nut oil in my list -- palm, coconut, olive, nut oils.  The others, the industrial oils, yes they do  have plant sources. look into how they are manufactured sometime.  eat whatever you want.
4781 2018-02-25 20:25:09 'worse than an oil spill'.
My thought actually. I 'prefer' an oil spill to... Hazardous as it is, I've seen ppl gently clean birds & marine life.
But this is simply catastrophic!

I just cleaned some lentils before cooking & that took a while.

4785 2018-02-25 20:24:49 The #GirlScouts have switched from trans fats to palm oil in their cookies. 

Question: Is the palm oil collected in a sustainable manner w/o harming the habitat of the animals living there?  @girlscouts 

P.S. I was a Girl Scout leader at a summer camp in Oregon.
4786 2018-02-25 20:24:31 People have their head in the sand so deep.... That when its finally fully confessed that the US is bankrupt....

4795 2018-02-25 20:22:25 Exactly. We are already entering into the technology era but people are still arguing over “clean coal”. There are more jobs now in clean energy than in coal, oil & gas combined. Yet many resist the change. We need to look at our education system now to plan for the future.

Based on the events of the largest oil spill in U.S. history. Does a great job of portraying the details that led to the disaster. The explosion scenes are intense, making viewers genuinely care about what the crew members went through.

And that’s why we have trained dr’s and researchers with certifications in their field. That’s ok. Not ok with the snake oil salesman.
4839 2018-02-25 20:17:26 I was advised to add coconut oil to my hair to make it shiny. But instructions on when to apply it weren't clear. Now it's all oily again.

4846 2018-02-25 20:14:51 "Just look at the pathetic state of the Middle East and ask if it would have been in such a mess if it were not cursed by oil and gas reserves". Hit the nail on the head.
4847 2018-02-25 20:14:46 Putting Coconut oil in your hair is what this world is all about
4848 2018-02-25 20:13:51 Nah... I liked guys that are a little bit cuddlier.
4849 2018-02-25 20:13:28 People who leave crumbs in the butter/margarine/hydrogenated oil product are monsters. Who raised you?
4850 2018-02-25 20:13:10 Fine them?  Hit them with the level of anti-trust action that Standard Oil faced 100 years ago...
4851 2018-02-25 20:13:04 And once the economy is on the right track he needs oil at $40-50 a barrel to discourage shale gas and renewable energy. What a circus!

4858 2018-02-25 20:11:59 I need one that exfoliates, gets rid of oil, shrinks my giant pores, folds laundry, and magically deposits $500,000 into my account
4859 2018-02-25 20:11:55 I know this seems like an over usage for some silly trend, but coconut oil saves lives dude. I use it in my hair and on my face for about 15 - 20 minutes once to twice a week and there is zero dryness to my hair or face and no break outs.

4875 2018-02-25 20:10:02 The corner shop still sold oil lamps and the oil that went in them - we used those! The cooker was gas, so we lit the oven. Probably played Scrabble.

4883 2018-02-25 20:08:56 What I really love about @bonappetit at @SCADdotedu is that the people working are able to confuse basic things like olive oil and vegetable oil so my salad get ruined and even more food waste is created

You are not far from the truth. Even in the oil sector, a successful businesswoman recently told Nigerians that FAITH was all she got to succeed with the OIL Bloc giving to her. One can imagine the business insight such lady would share to emerging entrepreneurs

4968 2018-02-25 19:57:45 What particular part of the Tweet is inaccurate?

I do agree, that oil is insignificant in this war. The #WarForOil hashtag was just used, as a well known meme for US intervention wars

Although what other issues do you have with the Tweet?

This a US proxy war for regime change
4969 2018-02-25 19:57:41 Do you think they're 'lycra louts'?

All kidding aside, they why didn't prices of all goods drop after the embargo ended and we entered an era of cheap oil? We should have experienced deflation, but *not* deflation fueled by private debt.

4982 2018-02-25 19:56:05 Price of oil was on the constant rise until i think 5,6 years ago when a massive influx of traditional and also fracking oil lowered the prices, but that might not last long considering that fracking proved to not be as profitable as originaly thought

4987 2018-02-25 19:55:17 Thanks!  I'm all in with this CBD oil I can't handle the psychotropic crap but ALL IN on the hemp side. I think it's helping me recover... I've been bed rest for 3 months! Much appreciated
4988 2018-02-25 19:55:13 In all honesty, I'm looking at it from a trade standpoint. As an add in on a deal during the draft, it holds more value. Could they give up their own 4th? Sure but as we know, at some point they need to starting adding to the prospect pool.
4989 2018-02-25 19:55:11 We roam ahead and turn out of where you see
I can’t hear the heart, this old oil stain
4990 2018-02-25 19:54:48 Nigeria is in economic hardship because we sell only oil & basically produce nothing. An oil producing nation importing Petrol & Diesel is a #Shithole country. Majority State governments depend on #AbujaHandouts instead of raising IGR. These the core problems that destroys us.
4991 2018-02-25 19:54:35 I defeated the rain changed the oil in my car before it came
4992 2018-02-25 19:54:32 Need some holy oil
4993 2018-02-25 19:54:30 Catherine. Speaking of being in this all together specifically what is your plan for the Montreal waste?? Are you going to implement regulations like you have on the Oil industry? Or is sewage waste acceptable within your climate plan?
4994 2018-02-25 19:54:08 But you will except money from major oil companies, fuel, and any other source. #crusty amazing how you can talk  about a veteran who put his life in the line so you can say n do what you want. You are the reason why California is now becoming a “shithole”. @Twitter
4995 2018-02-25 19:53:29 Hot water bottle wrapped and beside said eat, warm olive oil and a few Solpadeine maybe?? It’s true.. the smallest parts of us cause the most pain!!
4996 2018-02-25 19:53:11 If I'm not moisturized, I will overproduce oil, and it'll create acne and bigger pores..
4997 2018-02-25 19:52:55 Nothing more annoying than running out of oil
4998 2018-02-25 19:52:53 It’s hard to believe people are too ignorant to know what oil and grease can do when poured into the drainage system, is there something wrong with our education system?
4999 2018-02-25 19:52:48 Liberals and logic are like oil and water, they just don't mix. The reason they don't like the 2nd Amendment because they are the reason we need the 2nd Amendment. Truth be told these shootings are being done by a liberal that got a hold of a gun.
5000 2018-02-25 19:52:27 They need a new manager and some oil money. I think the team does have some very good players, but Wenger has become like a comfortable Govt. Job employee at @Arsenal and is clearly out of fresh ideas.
5001 2018-02-25 19:52:25 Same as me! The ones I made recently were amazing as I let the  oil smoke! X
5002 2018-02-25 19:52:05 He most certainly is but the pick gives them multiple options. Again, no issue w/ the trade but would've taken the 4th if given a choice.
5003 2018-02-25 19:51:44 Oil leke pahuch jao phir unke pas
5004 2018-02-25 19:51:24 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
5005 2018-02-25 19:51:22 I’ve not seen any angry tweets.  Some people’s takes are all in their own heads.  Explains a lot of Oil Twitter traffic this year
5006 2018-02-25 19:51:11 Yes Giles I think it is, looks like a Saudi Arabian Oil Party if I’m honest
5007 2018-02-25 19:51:09 InfoChip is the only custom ID provider focused on providing heavy-duty tags for the oil & gas markets.
5008 2018-02-25 19:50:59 I have visited Borneo a couple of times over the last few years and its not a pretty sight. Vast areas of primary and secondary Rain-forest which took millions of year to form gone, with any reaming areas under constant threat. We need to stop using Palm Oil full stop #PalmOil
5009 2018-02-25 19:50:59 The bubble bath stuff I got has coconut oil in it. My ass slid all the way down to my neck when I sat down.
5010 2018-02-25 19:50:29 Interesting to see people’s positions on things.
Mine would be to continue with oil exploration given that it’s gone a fair way already. As a compromise I would involve TCs with the intention to include in decision making. I don’t agree with Turkey threats but can understand it.
5011 2018-02-25 19:50:28 Meanwhile, because I’m a moron, we’ve run out of oil. Again. Hot water bottles all round.
5012 2018-02-25 19:50:23 Our daughter is a seizure patient she’s 23 years old now and graduating from University with a double major and a double minor. She had two brain surgeries as a child and has a seizure disorder. She’s been seizure free for two years due to CBD oil from Hailey’s Hope in Colorado.
5013 2018-02-25 19:50:21 Keep ya seed in good oil, keep people around you who gone help you blossom#chrissaidit
5014 2018-02-25 19:50:17 Like ginger root is high in salisyitic acid which is an anti-inflammatory. Aspirin, salisyitic acid, comes from Willow bark tree. Is that too snake oil. How about hydrocodone ? It's a synthetic version of heroin. Many medications are discovered from natural cures.
5015 2018-02-25 19:50:03 Fried cooking oil reminds me of my mother.
5016 2018-02-25 19:49:56 FYI just like the tides, revenues from all sources ebb and flow, rise and fall. From hurricanes 2 oil spills Floridians have survived and will continue 2 do so. 
Floridians were happy and flourished long before tourism and would adapt if it were gone tomorrow. That’s how we roll!
5017 2018-02-25 19:49:52 So funny ... my dating profile says that !
5018 2018-02-25 19:49:48 Some animals are more equal than other animals.
5019 2018-02-25 19:49:37 In the US you mean? What does it matter? America upset a lot of rich people by playing with the oil prices. Saudis and Russia will not tolerate it forever. They will unite the pricing strategies and believe me - china will join.
5020 2018-02-25 19:49:34 Is there a test for Green Party leaders in which, when the subject turns to oil sands, you must say something which is demonstrably untrue within the next 30 seconds?  Because it sure seems that way.
5021 2018-02-25 19:49:32 Question about what happens if the Yuan winds up becoming the global reserve currency.
Sensenbrenner cites inflation, trade, particularly oil.
"These communists who run China are pretty smart capitalists."
5022 2018-02-25 19:49:25 using a beard oil with gold flakes in it and i reached the bottom of the vial where it's more flakes than actual oil, now will the radiant metallic glow be enough to distract you from how bad our cheek-kiss synchronization is? time will tell
5023 2018-02-25 19:49:23 the narativ you tell about speculators are betting on wich will be mass adopted. Only assets coming close mass adoption on a global scale today is oil, gold and lithium. It will be no winner or looser in the top 10 marketcap. Market ass whole will win 
5024 2018-02-25 19:49:21 Can we go on a nature hike and sketch trip? Maybe @Corellian can come too and get ideas for her next awesome oil pinting!
5025 2018-02-25 19:49:17 水(ウォーター)とは仲が悪いです。
5026 2018-02-25 19:49:09 Sadly I think this may turnout to be true. Companies would have to be idiots to consider investing CANADIAN oil and gas after this debacle. And so BC will get what it wants by shooting Canada in the foot.
5027 2018-02-25 19:49:06 I use mainly skincare products from @lush as they are great for sensitive skin.
For a good moisturisation, I use coconut oil and add in a bit of lavender oil & tea tree oil to help with breakouts. Not only does it help your skin, but it can make you feel more relaxed #lbloggers
5028 2018-02-25 19:49:06 Oil prices were significantly higher
5029 2018-02-25 19:48:32 I didn't think Twitter stood for anything, but partisan censorship.
5030 2018-02-25 19:48:24 If I remember correctly they make orange based sprays that work pretty well. Or we made an oil + chili powder mix that worked really well.
5031 2018-02-25 19:48:18 A5. Superdrug do a sensitive skincare range that is vegan and amazing on the skin, I also recommend just using coconut oil, it is so good for your skin! #lbloggers
5032 2018-02-25 19:47:58 Watered down waste oil would give you a tan without flying anywhere  
5033 2018-02-25 19:47:50 I agree. US, especially under GW Bush, destabilized ME, all for their ‘Crusade’ and oil grab. Same in US to poor communities, where gangs are most prevalent. Climate change will exacerbate
5034 2018-02-25 19:47:50 Well I don't think the Oil are doing much better, it will depend on how the final 20 games pan out. If we wind up with 75 points, were pretty F.U. PS I love the Oil, it's a lost season
5035 2018-02-25 19:47:37 Lol for obvious reasons you dont use a boiling hot oil. Smh
5036 2018-02-25 19:47:26 I would prefer to keep Maroon out of the two of them, But that is not going to happen
5037 2018-02-25 19:47:13 Thank you! I put on rose oil 
5038 2018-02-25 19:47:11 Trumps Zinke is working overtime to remove energy standards designed to protect the environment, taxpayers, and worker safety, 

Zinke is holding a veritable fire sale of public lands for the oil and gas industry.
5039 2018-02-25 19:47:04 Hair treatment where you apply a heated oil (avo, coconut, jojoba, olive, castor etc I usually make my own blend of the oils) on your scalp and then wear a shower cap and wrap with a hot towel for 45min-1hr and then wash out. Obvs have to shampoo your hair before treatment.
5040 2018-02-25 19:46:58 @PontusAberg Welcome to Oil Country!
5041 2018-02-25 19:46:54 My mom just poured olive oil in my ear and said they used to do it all the time "back in her day" so if I die, you know why
5042 2018-02-25 19:46:45 You absolutely cannot keep maroon and Lucic on the same team… It’s killing us now
5043 2018-02-25 19:46:41 $50? they must throw in an oil change too
5044 2018-02-25 19:46:39 If corn oil is made from corn and vegetable oil is made from vegetables i wonder what baby oil is made from?
5045 2018-02-25 19:46:38 I personally don’t avoid oil, not a concern. But people can if they like and still get essential fats from the plants listed. Can you elaborate on what you mean by “But isn't enough prodn of those natural fats to replace animal fats even just from dairy” ?
5046 2018-02-25 19:46:34 Ya ya whatever. Tried BC wine. Not worth the price. Alberta should cut off the gas and oil to you as well. Let you pos freeze in the dark maybe then you won’t be able see enough to continue putting trash and shit in the ocean. Hypocrites.
5047 2018-02-25 19:46:30 Is oil good? Velociraptors are killin the planet and theyre not even alive. Check9
5048 2018-02-25 19:46:30  and #NASCARraceday #AtlantaMotorSpeedway don't mix, just like oil,'s & water don't .  when this happens

5051 2018-02-25 19:45:51 Causing more division in the US, TRUMPS Gave a speech to an oil industry group in September, Zinke complained that approximately 30 percent of Interior Department employees were not “loyal to the flag,”

5054 2018-02-25 19:45:18 Check your Engine oil today.
5055 2018-02-25 19:45:12 Good stuff. Lower oil prices. Technology continues to deflate the global economy.  The #WarPigs could throw up a distraction?
5056 2018-02-25 19:44:48 Who's the athlete wearing so much oil he looks like a Ken Doll?! #WinterOlympics #ClosingCeremony
5057 2018-02-25 19:44:41 I’m just waiting for him to say “At this point what difference does it make”...like his fearless (and by that I mean cowardly) role model.
5058 2018-02-25 19:44:38 I hope you have time to read. Buharinomics, apart from Oil price crash, ALMOST totally destroyed Nigeria. So quit frothing over "PDP did this or that" and focus on the damage by clueless Buhari, under whom EFCC drops cases against PDP decampees to APC. Anti-corruption my foot!
5059 2018-02-25 19:44:30 invade syria and are occupying oil wells
5060 2018-02-25 19:44:26 Amazon keeps sending me emails about hundred packs of wicks because a few weeks ago I wanted to light an oil lamp in the daytime and when confronted claim to be looking for an honest man. My inbox sacrificed for a two millennia-old shitpost.
5061 2018-02-25 19:44:10 Me: Hey you’re Ashley right? I remember you we met through mutual friends 6 months ago. Did you ever get the oil changed in your Honda Civic? 

 Everyone I’ve ever met: dang girl you is a creeper
5062 2018-02-25 19:44:05 Same oil.
5063 2018-02-25 19:44:04 Best part of having an air fryer is that you can fix burgers in the middle of the night without worrying about oil. Of course you will wake everyone up but that’s not important.
5064 2018-02-25 19:44:04 Oil of Gladness by Dark Horse Brewing Co. found at Stubby's Gastropub. Get it before it's gone!
5065 2018-02-25 19:43:52 Doesn't it span two continental plates? Can the North American side opt out? 
5066 2018-02-25 19:43:52 Lol.. Get some snake oil
5067 2018-02-25 19:43:42 You gotta be kidding. Trump distorting Fox news? That's like shaking a blender, or buttering oil, blurring the fog, painting coal black, sugaring candyfloss, farting on poo, giving fish swimming lessons,... I mean.. seriously?
5068 2018-02-25 19:43:23 I mixed a dry oil in with my foundation for the first time today and I think my life is changed
5069 2018-02-25 19:43:21 OPEC cannot control oil prices!!!
The United States can!

5070 2018-02-25 19:43:21 Emotions and strategy are oil and water. Something happens and people get emotional — *that* is normal human behavior. 
Now w social media though, ppl get together, mobilize and go on the offensive — and it’s working! Which is actually the problem.
5071 2018-02-25 19:43:20 Not really interested in the liberal, atheistic, enslave the populous by taking away things that make their lives more comfortable rhetoric. Snake oil salesmen not welcome.
5072 2018-02-25 19:43:18 " after realizing a nearly 30 percent increase in the price of oil in 2017, the company still missed its profit targets by a wide margin."

5077 2018-02-25 19:42:31 @FullyChargedShw Hello. Good episode on heat pumps. You might like to pay @NTPlasNewydd  a visit. They have an impressive 300kW marine source heat pump,  transferring heat from the Menai Straits. Saves them £40k a year. They  used to use 1,500 litres of oil a day!
5078 2018-02-25 19:42:28 "…And the yoke will be destroyed because of the anointing oil" -Isaiah 10:27
5079 2018-02-25 19:42:16 He keeps 40.000 troops on EU Cyprus! trespasses properties of over 200.000 EU citizens ransacks over 536 Christchurches in EU, changed demography of 37% & now attacks oil rig platforms attempting 2 steal frm EU-CYPRIOT EEZ as Subordinate state officials audaciously claim share!!
5080 2018-02-25 19:42:16 USA became oil independant further to fracking technology & huge capacity making it an exporter of fuel. All expected. UK will fare much worse trading outside of a block. A small country with no natural resources cut off from Europe by tarrifs making everything imported expensive
5081 2018-02-25 19:41:59 Because oil companies would rather have a pipeline company feed their other refineries than pay to upgrade old refineries to handle dilbit or build new ones. And Chevron sold that remaining refinery to an Alberta company so that tells you how they feel about KM's effect on it
5082 2018-02-25 19:41:58 Peppermint oil is a GODSEND
5083 2018-02-25 19:41:46 lemon hemp oil is pretty tasty lol
5084 2018-02-25 19:41:39 How much diluted bitumen is refined in Canada? 

My understanding is there are only a couple refineries equipped to refine large quantities of bitumen and they aren't in Canada. If anything it's blended with other types of oil in small quantities right?
5085 2018-02-25 19:41:37 The only sound in the empty construction site was the popping of a fire someone has lit in an oil drum.

5089 2018-02-25 19:40:30 Niggas be on instagram putting oil in the car and be putting hashtags like #JackOfAllTrades 
5090 2018-02-25 19:40:21 Bang on. Some old oil refinery in Brisbane!
5091 2018-02-25 19:40:18 夏とかTシャツに油のシミできるよねえ。あれ透けるからほぼ全裸みたいになるよ僕。
5092 2018-02-25 19:40:15 Unfortunately refining oil is still a necessity.
5093 2018-02-25 19:40:14 Its a repairing hair mask which feels cold on your head which apparently enhances the effect of the macadamia oil and other ingredients, my hair feels so soft!

5100 2018-02-25 19:39:53 I’m going to pull for whatever team gets maroon, unless it’s Calgary
5101 2018-02-25 19:39:46 You can get heat friend olive oil...it’s great for cooking with tip from a Greek ha
5102 2018-02-25 19:39:31 Then any lighter oils would be better. Grape seed makes a very light oil. Avocado is a light oil.
5103 2018-02-25 19:39:13 Oil..the republicans Texas gold..that got us to Middle East..with bush and his cronies..perfect sense.
5104 2018-02-25 19:38:58 Oh wow ima try some of that I use Jamaican black castor oil and raw Shea butter restorative conditioner
5105 2018-02-25 19:38:57 when you say welcome to oil country ...I'm not sure what to make of it.
5106 2018-02-25 19:38:51 I need olive oil 
5107 2018-02-25 19:38:44 Vibranium can't be enough. Plenty of poor nations have valuable resources—oil, diamonds, gold, rare metals galore. Those weren't even necessary for low-resource nations like the UK, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, So. Korea, Singapore, Israel They have freedom, law, trade, education.
5108 2018-02-25 19:38:39 The skin helps it cook better & with less or no oil…plus tasty 
5109 2018-02-25 19:38:31 Because the world is behind terriosim,,, it's the powers behind the government,,, the central banks,,,they control everything....they are very evil people,, they worship Satan,,,, the real world goes very deep....it's not abt oil,, it's abt controling a nations money supply...

5113 2018-02-25 19:38:14 Imagínense lo que fue la noche,   fui a fuel oil y volví con torta de cumpleaños jajajajajajajaajaja
5114 2018-02-25 19:38:01 To make a good salad is to be a brilliant diplomatist – the problem is so entirely the same in both cases. To know exactly how much oil one must put with one's vinegar.
5115 2018-02-25 19:37:58 Thnx Tony. I saw a documentary several years ago about HW, was fascinating. This might drill down a little deeper. Oil keep me mincers peeled for it. Cheers
5116 2018-02-25 19:37:57 they probably have some on HRC though.  Uranium, oil exports, a hazelnut farm in Rep. of Georgia.  Some 'leveraged' banks to launder all that money.
5117 2018-02-25 19:37:40 How can’t you fix a flat, do a oil change, or hook up faucet 
5118 2018-02-25 19:37:37 Charlie stepped in my oil paints and now I have white paw prints on my black sheets
5119 2018-02-25 19:37:34 There is no equivalence between Ven and UK ! Ven is oil dependent economy , import only ,$ debt to US, China, black market, corruption, drought, crude oil. UK is monetarily sovereign. Parliamentary democracy ???
5120 2018-02-25 19:37:30 I use Earth Balance Olive Oil Spread.
5121 2018-02-25 19:37:15 Coconut oil is a great idea
5122 2018-02-25 19:37:13 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
5123 2018-02-25 19:36:50 What's up with that @jack @Twitter @TwitterSafety ?
5124 2018-02-25 19:36:32 Final comment, like all right wingers, you take the view to blame the  Government, because it is left wing, - whilst in fact, it was the opposite of the oil spike of 73 that happened in Venezuela. Oil prices play a key role in the world's economy, but then you know that...

5134 2018-02-25 19:34:53 LRT... Late Professor Ojetunji Aboyade wrote several books on development economics and strategic planning in Nigeria. He even established a think tank;  The Development Policy Centre with Prof Mabogunje & others. 

Nigeria was more interested in oil.
5135 2018-02-25 19:34:49 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
5136 2018-02-25 19:34:10 Buy an actual Aloe leaf and scrape the insides of it out , whisk it and put it ina spray bottle w water and an oil of your choice, or you can put rose oils , stuff like that !
5137 2018-02-25 19:34:04 Neither could you before oil money.
5138 2018-02-25 19:34:02 The inflation of the 1970s started with the oil crisis. It wasn't a money supply problem but a resource problem.
5139 2018-02-25 19:34:00 Ok - so Botox can kill you , cigs can kill you , alcohol drugs can kill you , diabetes liver failure can kill you, sunflower oil can kill you, and gluten can kill you. What you are left with is just life - Love it and live it !! Stop obsessing !!
5140 2018-02-25 19:33:57 Jane McGonigal's peak oil game and extinction game did seem like interesting concepts. I still feel the best use for gaming is teaching people about history. Even if they aren't realistic the old WWII games always got me more interested in history.

5143 2018-02-25 19:33:28 Shark liver oil is used to make Preparation H.
5144 2018-02-25 19:33:18 Just incidentally, how did the world react to the oil spike of 73?  Let me remind you. It was accompanied by the 73 -74 stock market crash, which was said, "to have a persistent effect on the US economy"
5145 2018-02-25 19:33:00 The world doesn’t know
How sad I am
My pain that can’t be mixed
Water and oil
Only above the surface
I can’t stop caring when I breathe
A lonely water child
I wanna let them know

5202 2018-02-25 19:24:47 Ah yes! I will. Under PDP, dollar was for the most part stable & predictable; from $1=N86 (1995), to $1=N156 (2014), until oil crashed. This is basic economics; oil fuels our forex prices. However, under ur messiah, oil crash, cluelessness & policy reversals caused $1=N530, 2017
5203 2018-02-25 19:24:46 Scored me a free oil change next time bc they didn't do what I asked them to do.
5204 2018-02-25 19:24:12 it’s sweet almond oil, I got mine from Holland and Barrett but it’s probably cheaper on amazon!
5205 2018-02-25 19:24:04 They have oil you have poverty, see the difference.
5206 2018-02-25 19:24:03 Little brothers aren’t so bad when they get your oil change done for you 
5207 2018-02-25 19:24:02 I forget. The corporate lobbyists don't have term limits. Making a new person learn the job every 8 years, despite her democratic support, while the same guy has been lobbying senators for the oil industry for 30 years is the antithesis of a representative democracy.

5232 2018-02-25 19:20:16 I'm meaning for the Oil. The cupboards are bare. They could have left Nashville out of the letestu deal altogether and traded him to CBJ for the 4th. The hesitation for me to think it's a good deal is Poile thinks a 4th is more valuable than Aberg. Maybe Chia should to.

5237 2018-02-25 19:19:51 have you seen the price of an oil (bitumen) spill 10s of thousands of jobs at risk, birds and fish killed, environment ruined, what price compared to a refinery that makes the product that we import?

They don't tell you that in 2000 Saddam began selling HIS OWN oil in euros, threatening the Petro-chemival cycle that keeps #usa afloat.

Ever wondered why every drop of oil is bought/sold in $ & USA has such a massive military?

Until rightly secured, American military will continue to sacrifice their troops, if necessary.
It’s an issue the American media neglects to report on.
5251 2018-02-25 19:18:19 Perhaps it’s first hand experience and recognizing a slick snake oil sale when I see it.  Perhaps it’s spending 20 years teaching adult bible school that helps recognize false or twisted scripture.
5252 2018-02-25 19:18:10 I never invested but just see it as an oil play that failed. I'm sure lot's of people made money trading the shares or buying low & selling high - wish I had!
5253 2018-02-25 19:17:59 Oreos, palm oil as an ingredient, deforestation because of plam oil, and orang utan deaths because of deforestation. Even if you're unconcerned about orang utans, do you want to eat palm oil, a cheap filler? That's how I deal with the devilry. :)

5259 2018-02-25 19:17:08 That's encouraging. Basically melt them all down together and 'fraction' them, as we do with crude oil.

5264 2018-02-25 19:16:18 Hi Terry. Are hydrophobic coats good for repelling oil and petroleum? If so, it could work. I have considered using teflon coated containers, but it will always be messy to play with ferrofluid and ferripaste ;)
5265 2018-02-25 19:15:58 YOU are the little jar of oil. He is using you to fill up other vessels. It is your job to go get the empty vessels.
5266 2018-02-25 19:15:44 @lushcosmetics can I use Yuge with hair gel in my hair? Or should I wash my hair then apply the hot oil treatment?
5267 2018-02-25 19:15:41 So does Dawn just like dunk one baby duck in motor oil every time they need to film a commercial
5268 2018-02-25 19:15:37 I'm an expert on "deadwood following the outgoing manager", our club is stuck with Fellani, Darmian, Young, Smalling etc...I disagree that the deadwood will follow unless Arsenal gets oil money
5269 2018-02-25 19:15:31 yes 2 simplification on my side, history has it's place/lessons but not as a blindfold otherwise where would anyone be but living in the past.  I doubt, "El Presidente"s would much prefer an easy big ticket oil/minerals 4 Chinese built infrastructure deal with China than trade.
5270 2018-02-25 19:15:29 This is the first time I hear anything about huge oil/gas reserves in Syria. What is the source of this information?
5271 2018-02-25 19:15:26 Wanting kroenke out and usmanov in is like jumping from fire into a pot full of boiling oil.
5272 2018-02-25 19:15:19 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
5273 2018-02-25 19:15:17 Was supposed to do a hot oil treatment on my hair on Wednesday... its Sunday evening now lol
5274 2018-02-25 19:15:11 When buying Olive Oil, seek out “extra virgin” oils. Avoid bottles that just say “olive oil,” or are “light” or “pure”......“Extra virgin” refers to the way the oil was extracted (it has nothing to do with the morality of the olives!).
5275 2018-02-25 19:15:10 Ofcourse. Everyone is a traitor except Barzani. Unless PYD is fighting in Afrin instead of running with their pants down like KRG oil lords did.
5276 2018-02-25 19:14:52 staring... Actually, he was thinking. This angle was perfect to paint.. An oil painting of this young fellow's face with that soft smile and the bright sun lighting up half his face and the background. Yes, he had to take a mental picture of this moment to draw later.
5277 2018-02-25 19:14:51 “You shouldn’t buy extra virgin olive oil because the mafia took over the olive oil industry” my mother ladies and gentlemen
5278 2018-02-25 19:14:34 Where can I get canna oil
5279 2018-02-25 19:14:29 Great Sex Tip: when you're going down, try using essential oil while they orgasm
5280 2018-02-25 19:14:21 Now it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, “Bring me another vessel.” And he said to her, “ There  is not another vessel.” So the oil ceased.

5284 2018-02-25 19:14:14 Aaron left to get oil at O’Reillys at like 10 and it’s now 12 and I have no idea where he is or if he’s still buying the oil??

5286 2018-02-25 19:13:53 US soldiers have devoted their lives to fight for America’s freedom and by that I mean the freedom to bomb and destroy other countries just to get some more oil.

5288 2018-02-25 19:13:36 No your comment was ‘a crash in oil prices’,  not due to oil prices. Other countries had the same pressures but did not succumb but expanded, using the example again of Japan which experienced a boom.
5289 2018-02-25 19:13:31 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
5290 2018-02-25 19:13:21 He seems like a real POS
5291 2018-02-25 19:13:12 So she went from him & shut the door behind her & her sons, who brought the vessels to her; & she poured it out. Now it came to pass, when the vessels were full, she said to her son, “Bring me another vessel.” & he said to her, “ There is not another vessel.” So the oil ceased.

5293 2018-02-25 19:12:40 bought new essential oil *joy* and confused why I’m not feeling joyful. ask for 5 drops and I put in seven...yet still sitting here with RBF....
5294 2018-02-25 19:12:27 You mean ‘carefully placed oil drip’ xD

5296 2018-02-25 19:12:10 tip: in muffin baking mixes you can replace oil with applesauce(haven't tried it with cake yet)
5297 2018-02-25 19:12:03 Hot oil would burn your fingers.

5303 2018-02-25 19:10:56 If another refinery in AB would be profitable, oil companies would be lining up to build it. Govt must not go where biz fears to go. Lots of continental refining capacity but needs pipelines to get there.  The big money isn’t actually in refining but extraction and retail sales.
5304 2018-02-25 19:10:52 It probs doesn't help that most off the counter shampoos are full of sulphates - legit the same stuff you get in dish soap. Sure, you get a nice lather but it strips all the oil off y'hair & isn't good for your scalp either. Deffo keep your eyes out for sulphate free stuff :D

5307 2018-02-25 19:10:18 Oh I have this problem, my roots get oily and my ends are dry. Aloe vera, rosemary oil and apple cider vinegar rinses all help with scalp health and clearing flakes. I found my ends are happy with a light leave in cream conditioner when they dry out. Or aloe. That stuffs magic

5314 2018-02-25 19:09:37 I don't think a 4th round pick is what we need. Very low percentage of those picks work out in the end.  We need players that can be in the lineup now, and cheap deals help.
5315 2018-02-25 19:09:25 Even if we accept the sick and twisted logic of:
“Let #Taiz suffer because it’s a bleeding site for #Houthi evil.

Problem is that the bleeders are Taiz people.

While #Houthis enjoy its taxes which is No.1 in #Yemen

Revenues based on production & sweat not oil or gas.

5320 2018-02-25 19:09:07 Oh wow I didn't realise Nutella was made of palm oil. Horrific to think these poor animals are affected, I never realised, may be daft question but where does Palm Oil actually come from and how is it linked to animals dying? :(

5322 2018-02-25 19:09:03 In Feb 2015 a broken down car (oil warning light and oil topped up by the driver from an oil can being carried in the car) on a Hard Shoulder Running section of the M1 was hit by a coach, the driver of which had ignored several red X signals. In March 2016 a driver ran out of >
5323 2018-02-25 19:08:57 Why did injecting oneself with oil to fake having big muscles become a thing in certain parts of the world?

5326 2018-02-25 19:08:21 Where's my coconut oil
5327 2018-02-25 19:08:14 Depends how you value the pick. From trade standpoint, it holds more value then Aberg in a potential future  move. If they use the pick, the benefits are obvious long term. On the flipside, if he can contribute now it helps today. I prefer the pick b/c it gives more options.
5328 2018-02-25 19:08:12 I am guessing you have a different view with facts. Not totally sure how she was allocated the oil block but i do know a bit of tyranny was involved. Real entrepreneurs without Gov't backing are SUFFERING
5329 2018-02-25 19:07:46 Several reasons: Alaskan oil supertankers have almost daily, since 1977, traveled past west coast of Van Isle, past Victoria, thru Haro Strait, past Gulf Isles, thru Georgia Strait to dock at WA State refineries such as Cherry Point. /2

5332 2018-02-25 19:07:02 I asked Pav to check the oil in my car and he comes back two hours later. I think he must have extracted the oil himself

5334 2018-02-25 19:07:00 The option for drilling in the Arctic was her payoff for her support of the #GOPTaxscam giving permanent tax cuts to corporations and wealthy GOP donors. Politics is as dirty as oil.

so then that must mean you're becoming one of the oil people?
5337 2018-02-25 19:06:49 Sad part is older people who NEED it but BELIEVE the lies about it...I'm talking HEMP

Hell, I'm wondering if there are CBD'S in hemp motor oil...

5339 2018-02-25 19:05:56 Canada neither buys or sells oil. Oil companies do. That is the free market, capitalist system we have that allows the refineries to buy the right type of oil from the cheapest supplier!

5344 2018-02-25 19:05:27 @AdamSchiffCA A suggestion to help with the school protection, we should not arm teachers. We should just move all the Police Sub-stations and Small Police Stations to the school grounds.
5345 2018-02-25 19:05:27 They got some oil so... it won’t be a shithole anyway.
5346 2018-02-25 19:05:17 Better for the oil industry to look at ending all business ties with B.C. companies. They buy a lot of supplies and hire technology consultants from B.C... better to look at Alberta, Saskatchewan for this. $Billions spent in B.C.
5347 2018-02-25 19:05:13 just a billion in oil money later!
5348 2018-02-25 19:04:49 Hard to not see NRA as yet another entrenched group designed to maintain a status quo which is outdated and opposed by the majority of Americans. Trump's MAGA has now exposed Evangelicals, alt right, CPAC and NRA. Big Oil with #ScottPruitt is next.  #ChangeIsComing

5353 2018-02-25 19:04:28 The American politicians used 9/11 plot to justify to the world that USA invasion to the middle east was to fight terror of ALQAIDA AND ISIS. These terror groups are America's affiliates. The real reason was to take gas and oil for free.
5354 2018-02-25 19:04:28 Easy! Stuff a lemon inside, rub some butter or oil on top & add salt/pepper. Can also some herbs (?rosemary/thyme). Cook in oven. If not eating today, wait to cook, then take meat off & then you have it for meals/sandwiches this week. 
5355 2018-02-25 19:04:26 Hi Ben, this is senseless! You re being lobbied to support cattle colony bill. Oil wells frm ur backyard owned by men frm desert, no road to nor potable water in ur village. 90% nation’s wealth frm ur region, ur pple in abject poverty& U talk of peanut? Be wise

175 grams of flour (plain)
250 ml of milk
5 eggs.
A generous pinch of salt.

The trick is to get the oil really hot before pouring in the mixture. So oil in oven 15 mins before cooking
5365 2018-02-25 19:03:15 @TefalUK I can’t find any recipes online for the Tefal Fry Delight INITIAL. I have no idea how much oil to use etc. If I use the Fry Delight recipe book, should I adjust any timings etc?   Thanks.

5368 2018-02-25 19:02:41 We don't have a country running our club ,so that's why we cannot win

5373 2018-02-25 19:02:02 I will see you in Wash. DC on March 24. A suggestion to help with the moment, we should not arm teachers. We should just move all the Police Sub-stations and Small Police Stations to the school grounds.
5374 2018-02-25 19:01:47 In truth,there's nothing special about a manager who has access to all that (oil) money.
5375 2018-02-25 19:01:26 Finally got my ass to the oil changers. Wish they’d gimme a high five #entitledmillenial
5376 2018-02-25 19:01:22 Then go inside and shut the door behind you and your sons. Pour oil into all the jars, and as each is filled, put it to one side.”

5380 2018-02-25 19:01:01 Apparently they are very good at this indeed.

A country with no real manufacturing, no real resources other than oil, but with a mighty military and an awesome intelligence gathering apparatus. 

Oh, and they have Putin, a cunning, ruthless autocrat who Donald Trump admires.
5381 2018-02-25 19:01:00 Kickbacks from the Rosneft oil deal if sanctions are lifted could also come into play.
5382 2018-02-25 19:00:51 I bet the oil bill makes up for that

5385 2018-02-25 19:00:38 We all know who the real snake is - the guy selling snake oil, the con man, the guy who couldn't get elected without help from a nation that means to do us harm
5386 2018-02-25 19:00:35 Nope - because as you can see they’re out of their packaging and covered in oil, salt and pepper. Not about to bag them up and take them back
5387 2018-02-25 19:00:32 Honey, that wasn’t God that created that body. That was some talented plastic surgeons, generous use of injections, and it looks like a whole bottle of baby oil.
5388 2018-02-25 19:00:28 We do need our finite oil to make tires and plastics and of course rocket fuel. We just don't need it to get from point A to point B.

5392 2018-02-25 19:00:11 1. Have you seen the price tag on a refinery?
2. Canada doesn't consume anywhere near the amount of oil we extract.
3. You would still need pipelines to move oil, it is by far the safest way to move it.
5393 2018-02-25 19:00:06 Did you know that some castor oils have been washed with hexane? Not St. Francis Castor Oil. It's organic & comes in a dark glass bottle.

5397 2018-02-25 18:59:47 Never say never. Shit happens. Exxon Valdez happened because they hired a drunk to run an oil tanker. Exxon Valdez has never paid it's fines. Oil still in the gravel on some Alaska beaches. Some fisherman comited suicide because they lost everything

5406 2018-02-25 18:59:01 @VonPancake
That the only reason we’ve spent trillions waging war in the M East is on behalf of Israel, and we do this at the behest of powerful Amer Jews and their various interest groups, which includes the entire mainstream media. .
We’ve spent trillions and never got any oil
5407 2018-02-25 18:58:54 Well, they one they have don’t exactly look likely to respect the IMO Marpol Annex VI fuel oil sulphur regs.

5414 2018-02-25 18:58:11 Aren't avocados already oils, it's like frying fish oil in olive oil
5415 2018-02-25 18:58:07 We should not arm teachers. We should just move all the Police Sub-stations and Small Police Stations to the school grounds. Solved...
5416 2018-02-25 18:58:03 I also cringe when people use any type of oil to cook bacon. You  don’t  need  it .
5417 2018-02-25 18:57:52 Oil and Gas class at MILD room?  Looooool.
5418 2018-02-25 18:57:47 The coconut oil made it better but it still was a bit sore 
5419 2018-02-25 18:57:32 Coconut oil after a shower and shave, is THEE best. 
5420 2018-02-25 18:57:31 Three small oil spills in inside coastal waters in past year.
5421 2018-02-25 18:57:31 This night I exhibited that superhero trait in me by repairing my generator, I changed the plug and changed the engine oil, I used a call a friend option though  that’s the best part of it
5422 2018-02-25 18:57:29 Girl use BIO OIL I SWEAR BY IT
5423 2018-02-25 18:57:21 Sadly to deny that the government isn't controlled by big money is ridiculous at this point.
The oil companies, the defense contractors, and yes Israel's interference in Washington and our elections
I'm not saying there aren't honest people in government but it must be difficult
5424 2018-02-25 18:57:04 i touched hot cooking oil.

ama
5425 2018-02-25 18:56:50 It’s very touch and go right now. I’m currently smelling like olbas oil with a tissue stuffed up my nose. Now there is a pretty image for you. 
5426 2018-02-25 18:56:42 Ok. Fine if you want Putin to run this country. And if you don’t want clean air or water or if you don’t mind oil spills on our coasts, or the taking of our beautiful Federally protected lands and anti-science rhetoric and a “white, rich privileged” country let’s vote for Trump.

5430 2018-02-25 18:56:30 If they had informed the public, or at least not lied & lobbied to kill cleaner tech, then we'd have seen gov't incentives for hybrids, EVs, and cleantech in general decades ago. And oil is cheap bc oil co's aren't held accountable for huge externalities, so costs don't reflect.
5431 2018-02-25 18:56:17 Aberg has decent upside, has another year on his deal, and adds some speed and skill. He could turn into a very good bottom 6 winger on a cheap contract next year. I'll take that over a 4th. Aberg looked good in the playoffs last year for them.
5432 2018-02-25 18:55:55 How much better? On a scale of 0 to "Pocahontas is lying naked on my bed with a bottle of massage oil in one hand and a 6 pack of craft beer in the other"...

5434 2018-02-25 18:55:51 If you get winter time blue's get a massage minus the oil. Listen to some feel good music& watch a movie that makes you happy.  Self Love& self care will get you through a depresses time.
5435 2018-02-25 18:55:51 When I had headaches, I used eat a small piece of ginger. Also when I have muscle aches from working out I rub lavender oil on that spot and it goes away within a few minutes

5444 2018-02-25 18:54:37 Oh, huh, didn't realize there was typically lard in there. Will have to try homemaking with coconut oil instead sometime for the vegans in my life.

5446 2018-02-25 18:54:28 Successive Nigerian governments, occupants of @AsoRock routinely turned Nigeria's oil block into some sort of candy they distribute as gifts to concubines, friends, associates, etc. No transparency, no competitive bid, it is at the mercy of @NGRPresident @alakijaofficial gained

Oil tankers can collide with other ships like the one off China last month.  oil now washing ashore in Japan.

5449 2018-02-25 18:54:10 Well it involves a Yorkshire terrier, a lava lamp and a 55 inch HD tv.

5453 2018-02-25 18:53:24 Fitton is a snake oil salesman. Acussations galore, doesn't have two facts to rub together. Perfect fox news analyst!
5454 2018-02-25 18:53:14 Except that some people will come on here to tell us how he's a deity that should always be appeased with Palm oil. Man is not even bothered. He should just shamefully retire at this point.
5455 2018-02-25 18:53:07 Ad revenue and the fact that he pushes his snake oil products on his lemming followers...

5473 2018-02-25 18:51:00 Accepting the nazi's scripted resistance program is still not the same as real resistance. Leisure class pumps out these scripts every day because oil pays for itself.

5477 2018-02-25 18:50:31 There is at least one good documentary w/ ex-employees of Fox 'news' getting into inner workings, exposing how 'editorial' decisions go; like a PR marketing firm. Also the fact they had no foreign bureaus except in ME oil belt & one in Asia, through Iraq war & last I looked.
5478 2018-02-25 18:50:05 @IBGDRGN Alr packed ur luggage? Bring vitamins, massage oil (for muscle pain), lots of socks & underclothes (in case u get sweat out a lot)

5492 2018-02-25 18:48:38 Finished proofing of Oil Apoc 4. I cried yet AGAIN at the ending. I hope my fans find it moving as well.

March, I'll do what I can with writing but it might not be much, and it's possible I'll have some days without Internet (which is good news as much as it's bad news).
5493 2018-02-25 18:48:35 Yes, that's exactly how it worked. Incredible, isn't it. Hillary was honest, and tried to present her policies, and was tromped on by snake oil salesmen, grifters and bots.
5494 2018-02-25 18:48:35 Just that he is a veteran add that didn't cost an asset. Not sure how much he will be ably to contribute, but I think can still skate and coach can trust in most situations.

5529 2018-02-25 18:44:01 So it was a Norwegian flag. But the point is it is about time that somebody called Norway out on their systematic and long-term abuse of the world sardine populations. Billions upon billions imprisoned in oil  and no one seems to care

5532 2018-02-25 18:43:39 Grace and the law aren't exactly like oil and water in that once we receive grace we then have the law written on our hearts.

5543 2018-02-25 18:41:59 Ive started layering deep conditioner & oil in my hair like im applying products in a wash & go and i’m forever changed. My moisture level is high af now.
5544 2018-02-25 18:41:34 That oil got me feeling like the man even tho i wasn’t really with it
5545 2018-02-25 18:41:05 @MummyHeathen  where do you get your CBD oil? And how do you use it? Mum's wanting some for her fibro
5546 2018-02-25 18:41:02 I highly reccomend an oil for itchy beard and a good brush.
5547 2018-02-25 18:40:52 Trouble is parking fees are not helping

5551 2018-02-25 18:40:14 marshall uses an oil heater to deceive the bot
5552 2018-02-25 18:40:14 ... And the oil there owners produce??
5553 2018-02-25 18:40:13 For soup, cook diced scallions in oil, then simmer with tofu, oregano, coconut milk and zucchini. Top with orzo.

5558 2018-02-25 18:39:51 But @jaketapper isn't an honest person, he's just a journalist at CNN.
5559 2018-02-25 18:39:35 @deepsteeptweet I tried your hand cream for the first time today. It felt so luxurious and my hands are satisfyingly soft. I'm glad you are cruelty free! I'm glad there wasn't palm oil in the ingdnt list! Positive impacts  happy consumer.
5560 2018-02-25 18:39:33 Wishing Davidson and Letestu all the best with their new teams and future roles. We’ll miss you here in Oil Country. Thanks for everything, boys.

5563 2018-02-25 18:39:27 I had one fundamentalist tell me it only takes “200 years” to turn things into oil/coal. His church told him so. Baptist. In Ohio. I couldn’t roll my eyes hard enough. ACK.
5564 2018-02-25 18:39:26 So apparently Oil FC destroyed Cartoon Network FC

5569 2018-02-25 18:38:28 The oil is for inserting pump for fake farts!  Would be smoking hot is ripe swamp ass and real farts!  Wish you would honer the fetish with real farts and swamp ass.  I'd be your biggest fan if u did

5575 2018-02-25 18:36:55 Why the hostility? Would you rather we became an oil barons club and bought silverware? He’s the greatest manager the club has ever known and he will move on. If not this season than next. I’ll share your frustration if he isn’t.
5576 2018-02-25 18:36:38 Managed to accidentally let almost all the air out of my GS's front tyre earlier. Have to say a quarter-ton of bike on 6psi handles like a bit of an oil tanker, slow turning and very sluggish. Lesson learned: don't trust petrol station air machines!
5577 2018-02-25 18:36:14 And then they mix your foundation with body oil....write on the floor or walls with red lipstick lol. Kids kodwa
5578 2018-02-25 18:36:14 Look at him. Do you really want him changing your oil anyway?
5579 2018-02-25 18:36:07 Still skeptical, obv I’d love to have OTA updates but I bet dealer networks love having 11570 cars come in so they can tell their customers they need a $200 oil change only dealers can do.
5580 2018-02-25 18:35:59 I can’t wait for tomorrow because i’m getting an oil change and i’m going to vacuum the shit outta my car so it’ll really feel like I have my life together

5588 2018-02-25 18:35:03 Everyday I have a bowl of marinated tomatoes. Weird? Maybe! So delish tho: dice up desired tomatoes, in a bowl put a splash of olive oil, 2 good pours of rice vinegar, salt, pepper, and dried basil. Add tomatoes and let marinate for 15 min! Enjoy!
5589 2018-02-25 18:34:57 The glaze?
5590 2018-02-25 18:34:55 Okay! Does it come in liquid or is it like coconut oil where you melt it?
5591 2018-02-25 18:34:37 There's over 42,000km of active oil pipelines in Canada right now.....this is not new technology.....pretty arrogant to say it will NEVER be built. Watch and see.
5592 2018-02-25 18:34:27 Why don’t you save the money and simply have all “your” generals come over to the Putin White House and give you a hot oil massage. Wouldn’t that make you feel good?
5593 2018-02-25 18:34:25 the canola oil and oven vine
5594 2018-02-25 18:34:18 No sort of eggs want to be done "fast", but longer than 10 minutes sounds like omelettes. Fried doesn't want to be too fast or it burns, and oil can burn. Fastest egg cooking worth eating is poached by gently dropped into gently boiling vinegary water. Prefer omelette, & poached.
5595 2018-02-25 18:34:17 Yup and it explains a lot

5602 2018-02-25 18:33:07 Next to her, the monorail was the color of motor oil.
5603 2018-02-25 18:33:06 You’re thick mate. Sir Ian Wood (a unionist) provided the values and volumes. Also the price of oil here is heavily influenced by the U.K. Gvt. Sources: BBC & Paddy Briggs, Oil Economist.
5604 2018-02-25 18:33:03 @HasbeHaalDunya pls also high olive tree/seeds/oil. It's very valuable cash crop of Arab but Italy & Spain largest produce  & exporters of olive ol & seeds. India is growi g HALF MILLION TREES probably in Rajasthan.

All of the ice shown during the winter Olympics was actually just white plastic with some clear oil thrown on it.
5606 2018-02-25 18:32:48 Good organizations don't give away guys w/ his contract and control if they believe he turns into that kind of player. Hopefully, he can but there is nothing to suggest it happens.
5607 2018-02-25 18:32:45 Hmm! That ermine-gland oil in the back...?
5608 2018-02-25 18:32:44 the soybean oil from the west.
5609 2018-02-25 18:32:36 Good for Africa. We will import 'em on the cheap, then overflow their tanks with cheap  Turkana oil.
5610 2018-02-25 18:32:36 Agreed, throughly deserved win...but before we all get carried away let’s not forget City were a 2 bob club that are now bankrolled by Arab oil money. It’s not like Arsenal have been thrashed by minnows...

5619 2018-02-25 18:31:19 that's a really good point, but it also requires some creativity on GM's part which I don't think Chiarelli has ever really demonstrated so perhaps he didn't even consider it
5620 2018-02-25 18:31:16 RT kylegriffin1: A 2nd judge has told the Trump admin it can’t keep stalling on Obama-era clean-air rules for oil and gas production on federal lands, saying the admin’s delay is “untethered to evidence” and likely to cause “irreparable injury” to states. …

5627 2018-02-25 18:30:00 £777m and all that oil money, obviously they will win some trophies
5628 2018-02-25 18:29:46 Maybe he did slide out of top when called up. As for letting him go, I don’t think the chemistry was there for him. He will likely be a 15-25 goal scorer for another team if on 2/3 line.
5629 2018-02-25 18:29:45 If I can find the oil  stop procrastinating on twitter and do your work sis
5630 2018-02-25 18:29:28 Obviously brother
5631 2018-02-25 18:29:19 Venezuela has a corrupt government, and a crypto currency that is backed by oil, with no information provided on how you obtain this oil physically. Nicolas Maduro is a dictator, and investing in dictators who restrict food to their citizens is bad business, and a bad investment.
5632 2018-02-25 18:29:14 From negligence in hospitals to unsafe transportation to hazardous food production to fake drugs to dioxins from generator to lunemployment to bad road to child labor to oil companies & COPD, to lack of fuel & electricity in hospitals

5642 2018-02-25 18:28:01 I just think Trump has our country in all types of dirty deals, globally. Oil is w/o question the biggest but all smart business deal makers have all sorts of deals flowing... many under the radar. I’m have no doubt this has been in the makings for years & years
5643 2018-02-25 18:27:53 Idk if it’s just me but it has like a coconut oil after taste 
5644 2018-02-25 18:27:50 I picked my car up from getting an oil change and as I got in the car the guy said, "It’s gonna ride like new pussy, bro."...and as I drove off, he said, "Enjoy dat new pussy bro!"

Hard to tell if he's the greatest human being I've ever met or the worst
5645 2018-02-25 18:27:45 Maybe we can rub peanut oil on all guns and they wouldn’t be allowed ANYWHERE near a school!!!

5648 2018-02-25 18:27:21 That will be too sensible.  Maturer citizens will not give their lives for oil &  multinational corporations. What does average citizens benefit from it. British Empire was spread all over the world but in UK they had not toilets or bathrooms in homes. Had to go to central public

5656 2018-02-25 18:26:42 She probably wasn’t familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings
5657 2018-02-25 18:26:40 There may be argument about ‘oil money’. But ‘oil money’ didn’t make us play like twats today.
5658 2018-02-25 18:26:34 I hate to be the one to say it. But pretty much every politician is in the pocket of big business.  Oil, Pharma, tech,  take your pick.  Some in lobby form some directly.    The "citizen" has been in third place for a long time.. And this is both parties, neither is innocent.
5659 2018-02-25 18:26:19 And oil money!!!

5673 2018-02-25 18:24:19 For sure but still think the pick itself has the potential for greater impact next season...if used as a trade chip as part of a bigger deal.

5678 2018-02-25 18:23:40 wow. Didn't expect my own reaction to posting this. Tears. Was remembering the US oil war euphamized as 'Desert Storm', where we went in to secure 'our' oil in Kuwait. Remember the vicious nationalism against anyone criticizing the action, including violence and death threats.

5691 2018-02-25 18:22:27 Wow lady you would blame the sun for burning your skin when you were the one that laid out with oil on your skin to get a tan, BUT. Damn the SUN for BURNING  you .
5692 2018-02-25 18:22:25 But fracking can be done in a safer manner than it currently is. And also the other forms of energy (if used properly) can significantly reduce the amount of oil/natural gas interests

5694 2018-02-25 18:21:27 Oh, nasty. Oil of cloves? I'm told that's supposed to help xxx
5695 2018-02-25 18:21:24 Aries and patience is like oil and water.
5696 2018-02-25 18:21:22 HAVE YOU TRIED COCONUT OIL
5697 2018-02-25 18:21:21 H.R. 2242: Keep It in the Ground Act of 2017
To prohibit drilling in the outer Continental Shelf, to prohibit coal leases on Federal land, and for other purposes.

The list of anti-American Democrats that want us dependent on foreign oil continues to grow
5698 2018-02-25 18:21:09 guys, if you want to get rid of acne scars VITAMIN E OIL IS YOUR FRIEND. you just use a q-tip and gently rub it in for a few seconds on each spot after washing your face at night and i’m telling you! you’ll start to see a difference within a week. it’s magic
5699 2018-02-25 18:21:01 @GrupoYbarra recently i bought un "aceite de oliva virgen extra". Under this is written "aromatizado". It has a very strange taste and i hate this. Is this permitted to sell this as   "aceite de oliva virgen extra"? Is this low Quality oil which You try to sell in this way?.
5700 2018-02-25 18:20:54 Have you ever been pummelled by brass knuckles? It's more tiresome than being sprayed by burning holy oil
5701 2018-02-25 18:20:53 Down please, up is a bit trendy, beard oil, drinks a special type of coffee and sourdough with avocado. Down seems more “you”
5702 2018-02-25 18:20:51 I heard if you sleep over night with coconut oil in your hair it helps but idk
5703 2018-02-25 18:20:49 Yawn, I’d keep control of the oil too. Why let it pay for terrorist armament, training. McConnell is a chameleon right now he’s in save his job mode.
5704 2018-02-25 18:20:46 Pukul berapa nak tidoq ni? Memang burn the midnight oil sungguh.
5705 2018-02-25 18:20:46 Agreed. Had they just flipped him to the Blue Jackets & get at least a 2nd for Maroon, it gives them 6 picks in the first four rounds and the 3rd in 2019 from the Davidson deal to play with in the off-season. The more options the better.
5706 2018-02-25 18:20:43 300 for a authentic mugen oil cap... you got me bent 
5707 2018-02-25 18:20:43 This is great in a stable environment.  When mkts that did not burn much oil, begin the adoption phase (see India), no amount of new tech can fully mitigate for this level of demand.  It can lessen from no new tech, but will not neutralize it.  Certainly not in 5 years. No chance
5708 2018-02-25 18:20:22 sketchbook gesso oil watercolor masters from American provinces
5709 2018-02-25 18:20:04 Who did oil get back ?
5710 2018-02-25 18:20:03 เฮ้อ เฮ้อออ เฮ้อออ ~~ อย่าพูดบ่อย เราเหนื่อยตามม พอแล้วววววววว
5711 2018-02-25 18:19:47 Also, if you make spaghetti squash, roast the seeds in the oven, tossed with oil, cinnamon, nutmeg, cayenne, and a bit of brown sugar. Great spicy sweet snack.
5712 2018-02-25 18:19:44 I be soooo pissed off when I run outta coconut oil and I gotta use lotion instead 
5713 2018-02-25 18:19:35 #TRUMP3RussianSpies Why is no one in CONGRESS alarm that 3 RUSSIAN SPIES ENTERED USA who authorize this, SECRETARY TILLERSON, why, OIL DRILLING QUESTION: Why have we not imposed SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA. LOOKS LIKE TRUMP AND TILLERSON WORKING FOR PUTUM
5714 2018-02-25 18:19:33 And, it's not about some notion of purity--we are all mired in oil products, which is exactly the problem.
5715 2018-02-25 18:19:31 But it irritates me when people fight about oil and OPEP. That’s really annoying to me. The root of that comes from a lack of communication. How is everybody feeling? Why is everyone upset? What does everyone want as the end result?
5716 2018-02-25 18:19:19 That’s it. 2 minutes to go bring on the first academy player for 15 years. ‘Look at us, we don’t buy a team. We produce one’ BULLSHIT everyone knows your an Arab oil money club
5717 2018-02-25 18:19:18 Yes, and most of my neighbours switched from electricity to propane/oil to heat their homes.
Those who didn't, often can afford to heat a single room only.
Well done, Gerry!
5718 2018-02-25 18:19:08 I ordered more nag champa oil after a very lucid/dissociative year and a half. Ive felt more grounded lately and was compelled to FINALLY buy some more. I realize its bc the smell acts as a tether to this life / my body. My path has moved on from detachment, and back to immersion
5719 2018-02-25 18:19:06 bruh if only i can understand…but every time he does his bodega owner impression…i’m floored haha…my fav ben barson joint is the most recent…bruh said…”i’ll replace your heart valve with valvoline motor oil be cause nigga you think you slick…” 
5720 2018-02-25 18:19:02 The "handgun instructor" may tip it in your favor...
5721 2018-02-25 18:19:00 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇
5722 2018-02-25 18:18:57 Govt regulates to increase public safety. Oil companies pay politicians to reduce regulation and cut cost reducing public safety. Politicians taking bribes & kickbacks should be held accountable.
5723 2018-02-25 18:18:48 Dang no body told me tea tree oil has such a strong smell 
5724 2018-02-25 18:18:40 let me bathe in that oil
5725 2018-02-25 18:18:34 Their serpentine member/shaft/cock varnished by mineral oil thrusted into their buried treasure
5726 2018-02-25 18:18:34 I think everyone in the world hates Man City. I know a lot of people and not one of them supports them. Can’t fill a stadium, can’t make enough money to actually fund the club and need Arab oil money. I just fucking hate city.
5727 2018-02-25 18:18:07 That oil $$$ too much to pass up Mark. Kind of like some politicians and @NRA money.  Pretty much the same hypocrisy I'd think.
5728 2018-02-25 18:18:04 we do use oil - because big oil (Alberta's true ruler) has made us so dependent. there are few choices.

but, my family has one small car, ride bikes and live in a smaller place. we all do what we can until we have real energy options...
5729 2018-02-25 18:17:59 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
5730 2018-02-25 18:17:49 Trump admin. Says methane enforcement rules are too expensive for oil,gas....the poison should not be controlled...similar too AR-10's...freedom!free enterprise!
5731 2018-02-25 18:17:26 Arsenal fans are true victims of money-football. A club with lots of  tradition/history destroyed by it's own owners who're just after the profit AND City, a club with zero t/h, run by oil from  Gulf-states with an open cheque book, buying success.
5732 2018-02-25 18:17:19 @POTUS CONGRATULATIONS Mr. President...first new oil refinery being built in 41 years in Fort Stockton, Texas....lots of new jobs, prosperity....MAGA
5733 2018-02-25 18:17:16 time I used Chevron 15/40 t/first HD Muli Grade marketed. We developed that at CF. It provided excellent stability and lower end detergent properties. When Valvoline added its version I found the same dependable oil. I new I could count on. No matter what package it came in.
5734 2018-02-25 18:17:05 Thinking about buying Rain Perfume Oil? Read our latest review of the product by ... #thecuring #Aromatherapy
5735 2018-02-25 18:17:02 *NRA blood money politicians will be voted out, gun reformers voted in
*tax cuts for everyone but 1% expire in 7 years, and the deficit will balloon to historic levels 
*US already produces more oil than we need, we continue to buy from Saudis because they’ve bought politicians
5736 2018-02-25 18:16:59 the zen of making your bed
5737 2018-02-25 18:16:52 In this case it's not. Snake oil does not work even if its peddled tomorrow.
5738 2018-02-25 18:16:50 But... But... But... 
5739 2018-02-25 18:16:50 The oil is stretching it a bit...
5740 2018-02-25 18:16:43 Decided I’ll make plantain with no t shirt on because even the oil popping won’t hurt as much as it does to be an Arsenal fan
5741 2018-02-25 18:16:40 So in addition to a game show host, you also elected a snake oil salesman.
5742 2018-02-25 18:16:32 There's nothing worse then a letting an oil company worth 250 million only for security purpose (defenders) win without a fight
5743 2018-02-25 18:16:30 @EdmontonOilers Best of luck Mark Letestu to you and your family. Thank you for wearing the Oil with pride and always being a professional. @BlueJacketsNHL
5744 2018-02-25 18:16:21 I supplied Venz steel & alumina plants fr DomRep & US for yrs. The indust city on RioOrinoco employed 10s of thousands then; almost none now. What happened is Hugo Chaves, liberal socialism. Socialist govts fail every time they’re tried.  Venz now exports oil & their best people.
5745 2018-02-25 18:16:18 . @JakeLingwood @IanJamesPoulter @piersmorgan  what a shame lads. But the good news is the Arsenal ladies team are still in "The Johnson Baby Oil Cup" #wengerin
5746 2018-02-25 18:16:13 In the oil refinery industry it’s a “chop shop” effect....outsourcing, contracting, renting equipment instead of owning which would be cheaper- but tax write offs, selling off units -leaving only a few who were promised security
5747 2018-02-25 18:16:12 that hemp lotion and body oil  got ya girl looking sharp
5748 2018-02-25 18:16:11 You mean the chemistry that has led to 3 losses in the last 4 games? That chemistry? They seem to be leaking oil!!! Absolutely play him, otherwise why go through the “he’s been cleared to practice stuff”?
5749 2018-02-25 18:16:11 Well, I'm not quite sure about that. Digital oil paintings? The ideas behind the art and the creative execution? I don't change one word of my critique. I may not be an artist but I do have a very good appreciation and love of art in whatever form or medium.
5750 2018-02-25 18:16:10 Dear Nigerians of conscience,
40 years and below professionals,
You have been keeping the oil sector, you have managed our education under the most awful conditions. You have been helping save lives in very bad health sector, you have kept our banks running. I applaud you
5751 2018-02-25 18:15:36 Absolutely the truth. More than half of the nation are moderates.. but the squeaky wheel gets the most oil..
5752 2018-02-25 18:15:33 Hey maybe if we built a pipeline to the east coast so we could sell oil to the rest of Canada, Quebec would have even more equalization money to help pay for there sewer dumping charges. Who ever thought it could be that simple.
5753 2018-02-25 18:15:10 Victor are you for BC or for Alberta oil, just curious? You’re changing sides so often I am losing track
5754 2018-02-25 18:14:46 @JackWilshere  you really are a pathetic excuse of a footballer. Stolen a living. I’ve seen oil tankers that are more agile
5755 2018-02-25 18:14:28 AHL depth, I guess? Always prefer choosing my own player over reclamation projects
5756 2018-02-25 18:14:20 That’s happened to me before put a shut ton of coconut oil before bed I heard that helps them grow faster
5757 2018-02-25 18:14:10 Apparently the ask for Pleks was Connor or Roslovic and that was obviously turned down. Petan was maybe countered but not sure. It might make sense but Oil would have to send a low round pick too I think
5758 2018-02-25 18:13:56 Like your Judeo-Christian to-do list. That's a very Old Testament view of the World. Jesus would not approve. But sounds like a great program if you own defense & oil stocks.
5759 2018-02-25 18:13:56 This was one of the gardens that ran down to the graveyard - just before the tunnel. They were great  I was never away from that beach. Used to bring the seagulls home that had oil stuck to their wings wrapped in my school cardigan. My ma's heart mustve been broke  Good times
5760 2018-02-25 18:13:53 So faith got a lady an oil block.
5761 2018-02-25 18:13:49 I just want to rub down with coconut oil and tan until I'm cinnamon and wear white forever...

5765 2018-02-25 18:13:03 I will always wonder why arsenal bought welbeck from man utd. EFCC need to look into that transfer. This is why alakija is thanking God for her oil block.
5766 2018-02-25 18:13:03 Lol glad the influx of oil money made you a Citeh fan. Zero history
5767 2018-02-25 18:12:57 Arsenal not winning anything this season and Kroenke gonna rub oil into Wengers back while Bould counts the gate money
5768 2018-02-25 18:12:50 every lip oil I get ends up smelling like weed lmao
5769 2018-02-25 18:12:49 RSS says only Brahmin thakurs Baniya Lala are Hindus and OBCs Adivasis Harijans are not considered Hindus by RSS
OBCs Backwards should be forced to pay heavy Taxes for Boosting US economy by participating in Arms Trade and Crude Oil Trade of US
5770 2018-02-25 18:12:22 But anyone going to a team that spends billions is going to win trophies,bit like going to Madrid or Barca,he’s just part of a team assembled with an oil rich country,can’t compete with that
5771 2018-02-25 18:12:15 How’s the oil money related to the quality on the pitch? No one told Chelsea to go buy Bakayoko & Morata
5772 2018-02-25 18:12:02 the guys changing my oil remind me of the guys from pawn stars and by that i mean one of them just called the other one stupid and laughed
5773 2018-02-25 18:11:56 Fuel oil estuviste de maravilla
5774 2018-02-25 18:11:55 I would be interested in seeing a list of the oilers that you wouldn’t be sad about trading… LOL

5776 2018-02-25 18:11:36 For everyone who is against fracking but also is against US involvement abroad: 
Our foreign policy history shows that we’ve been involved in the Middle East bc of our oil interests. Thus, fracking is part of a solution to staying out of middle eastern conflicts.
5777 2018-02-25 18:11:32 We should run on clean energy. Fuck oil and gas.
5778 2018-02-25 18:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza for dinner today will be: crispy crust with fresh motor oil and arugula.
5779 2018-02-25 18:11:00 I hope you don't trust mainstream media news still? They tell half truths sometimes, to suit their agenda. In this case, to economically cripple Venezuela so western companies can come in to control oil. Like in Iraq & Libya.
5780 2018-02-25 18:10:55 3 league cups in 5 whole seasons. We never thought we’d ever see that did we? What massive oil cunts we are
5781 2018-02-25 18:10:52 I am a pro-Trumper, but in no way should teachers be armed. Think back to 3rd  grade. Can you imagine Mrs. Whoever grabbing a pistol and confronting crazy man with assault rifle. No way. If law enforcement deputies cower at go time, imagine a docile educator. @realDonaldTrump
5782 2018-02-25 18:10:43 @SecretaryPerry Congratulations on the first new oil refinery being built in 41 years in Fort Stockton, TX....thank you Rick Perry and thank you President Trump...MAGA
5783 2018-02-25 18:10:34 Last night I washed my makeup off with an oil free makeup remover, then did a clay mask, then moisturizer... yooo that routine was life .

5788 2018-02-25 18:09:36 I thought those were just for me??? 
5789 2018-02-25 18:09:25 I have tried reaching out to Steve with a opportunity to sell the besafe app to some very large players (the largest) in the oil and gas industries! wonder why I get no response?
5790 2018-02-25 18:09:13 Yeah, said the same thing when I saw it. I get the line of thinking but the pick gives them more flexibility & there is a reason Predators are willing to take a 4th.
5791 2018-02-25 18:09:07 It’s right next door to the oil change place!
5792 2018-02-25 18:08:55 Excedrin, hydrate and peppermint oil on neck and temples!
5793 2018-02-25 18:08:48 Coconut oil !!!
5794 2018-02-25 18:08:47 Wow for the first time in my life swallowed a huge ass omega 3 fish oil pill just bc of the TEAS (I heard it helps with memory)
5795 2018-02-25 18:08:35 Anyone or anything to do with trump or Franklin Graham, Tony Perkins, and rest of the charlatans is the antithesis of Christlike behavior. Snake oil salesmen - the whole lot of them.

5797 2018-02-25 18:08:20 Says someone from a country with more than half of Africa's oil but their price of Fuel is 10X that of US.  I am asking all blacks to be focused on the things that really matter. But still u didn't get it. That's why we are forever going to be stuck. No be long talks.
5798 2018-02-25 18:08:14 So why would Nsh trade him for a 4th rounder? I’m pretty sure they evaluate players better than oil .
5799 2018-02-25 18:08:12 Neither would the oil and gas industry.
5800 2018-02-25 18:08:00 @_heff_ See heff- all my Sunday school/Church goin has finally paid off! The Oil traded for the Pontiff! He will bring dearly needed size @ 5'6" / 135lbs ... If the Oil were a peewee team ... God Bless you on Chia-Pets day of rest ... Jesus Loves You
5801 2018-02-25 18:07:51 i left my cleansing oil in the shower stall yesterday and of course it got stolen B^( hhh
5802 2018-02-25 18:07:51 Also, tar sands oil is a great dietary supplement
5803 2018-02-25 18:07:42 2 spoons baking soda. Add half a glass vegetable oil. Then add third of glass vinegar mixed with a dye.
5804 2018-02-25 18:07:38 Arsenal just fall my hand sha

5808 2018-02-25 18:06:55 We have turned ordinary.....

They've run this club down.

If #Arsenal continue to go down like this, they might strike oil.

So pathetic
5809 2018-02-25 18:06:50 This is a well deserved win for €it¥. Forget the oil money.
5810 2018-02-25 18:06:48 Coconut oil once a week then wash your hair

5812 2018-02-25 18:06:41 Do you sell cord liver oil ??
5813 2018-02-25 18:06:37 I know “energy independence” doesn’t ring like it used to, but ethanol making up 10% of domestic fuel consumption seems like a nice built-in hedge on oil prices creeping up
5814 2018-02-25 18:06:35 ! And guns...sounds like the plot for a great movie..Guns and Oil...written and produced by Baba Yaga!
5815 2018-02-25 18:06:26 Those cunts would be Ole’-ing in League One but for the oil money
5816 2018-02-25 18:06:22 Nigeria my country, where oil block supposed to be for everyone is used as a gift to one individual. God bless NIGERIA
5817 2018-02-25 18:06:20 Don't you think sir india has become digital colony. If the data is the new oil then owners of the data are American and Chinese (Google, FB and alibaba ) why india does not create it's own INTERNET giant. AI , IOT and Nanotechnology are future of world.

5824 2018-02-25 18:04:32 I love coconut so much. Coconut water? Delicious. Coconut oil? Life saver. Coconut milk? Bomb as shit & now I don’t have to drink dairy. Coconut ice cream? Bet. Coco butter lotion? The best. Coconut? Please
5825 2018-02-25 18:04:14 I remember in my first week of doing Schlenk line chemistry that the stopper popped off and landed into a dirty oil bath. Who knew how important elastic bands would come to be for us chemists!
5826 2018-02-25 18:04:04 Oily skin? It's still OK to use cream foundation. Apply it with a damp makeup sponge, which picks up the pigment but not the product's oil.

P.S.: I can't even afford that crap
5829 2018-02-25 18:03:36 Somewhat true...however, in the 20th century it was mostly state money, power and dacha’s. Complete central control. Now, it’s private money, mercenaries, oil and minerals.  Although the private money is at risk from the state. Less centralized.
5830 2018-02-25 18:03:29 Things I love: Mindful walks, travel photography, music, oil painting, and Zendo.
5831 2018-02-25 18:03:24 I actually like the smell of coconut oil once it’s on your skin 
5832 2018-02-25 18:03:06 W/E Wrap:
With the exception of the FTSE, global equities higher across the board; Greenback and most major currencies steady; US Treasury yields lower post last week's auctions; oil extends multi-week rebound.
5833 2018-02-25 18:03:05 No Boomer Sooner for Scott Pruitt.  Not OU way. He demeans scripture by his “Taliban” like interpretations of the holy word.  His primary mission is to serve as head stooge for Kochs, Mercers and other greedy oligarchs and big oil, and do their bidding to destroy our environment.
5834 2018-02-25 18:03:01 Anything fried in olive oil is healthyyyyy. i think. 
5835 2018-02-25 18:02:52 Guy, leave dat tin. No be Folorunsho Alakija come for Twitter to yarn dust about how her oil block that made her richest black female *on Earth* was "by faith."

Abeg, who attention epp? Make person enjoy EPL jaré.
5836 2018-02-25 18:02:50 Since the people of Venezuela are starving, work is barely being done. They are too weak & hungry for heavy labor so the oil industry has began to slow down #squatVZLA
5837 2018-02-25 18:02:44 Richard Burton, top actor, words fail me, Smooth as olive oil!!
5838 2018-02-25 18:02:44 Short ribs were done 185/24 with shiitake mushroom and dollop of miso paste. Polenta was 3.5:1 ratio of water to polenta. Stir in some goat cheese to finish. Roast some tomatoes with olive oil and sea salt. Sauté some beet greens. Reduce bag juice for sauce.
5839 2018-02-25 18:02:43 Oil rich Saudis forced Arsene Wenger to buy Granit Xhaka for £35m? Hahahahaha
5840 2018-02-25 18:02:20 It could easily come from increasing taxes on oil & gas. Just a 2% increase could pay for what is needed, but the legislators are getting paid by these companies. The biggest question is where the revenue from oil & gas we already “had” went..??

5843 2018-02-25 18:01:27 1) Russia is poor nation. It needs money. All it has is oil & weapons. Neither Pakistan can afford

2)India buys all big Russian stuff Weapons & Nuclear reactors 

3)Russias sole aim with Pakistan is to annoy USA. Russia also supports Iran & Syria -both highly anti USA & Israel
5844 2018-02-25 18:01:24 Formula for success: rise early, work hard, strike oil.
5845 2018-02-25 18:01:08 Not arguing but struggling to understand the paradox of fish oil being anti-inflammatory and inflammation being key to muscle growth.
5846 2018-02-25 18:00:31 Everyone should pay thru licence plate tax and amount decided on to do the job should not vary much from cars to trucks. $4.00 fuel will cause economy to slow. Open up oil production, become energy independent.
5847 2018-02-25 18:00:29 You are I'm sure! It's to be expected when oil rich Middle East dictators are allowed to spend billions of their dirty money on pet PR projects
5848 2018-02-25 18:00:25 when snake oil isn't enough, snake powder is the next big thing, @soylent, mix it with SV kool aid for a better taste.
5849 2018-02-25 18:00:22 That article is not the one on the oil it’s the one where a girl could have her natural hair at school because of school policy deeming it a distraction.
5850 2018-02-25 18:00:16 Avoid aspirin, products containing aspirin, fish oil, or vitamin E for the first 48h after your #BreastAugmentation or as instructed by your physician. These products may increase bleeding and thus meddle with your recovery. Source: @DartmouthHitch #PlasticSurgery
5851 2018-02-25 18:00:15 Nothing will change, sit back and wait for the next mass shooting. Arms dealers are the same as oil and drug companies, they run the world's governments.
5852 2018-02-25 17:59:43 Ya not flipping kidding.    Mr Martin.  Time to get to coil oil before snek.  Freezers.  Moberlised or lass
5853 2018-02-25 17:59:37 I had the same issue. Vitamin E oil sorted me out thankfully!!
5854 2018-02-25 17:59:32 @BMW so why do your n62 leak oil so bad, expensive car ..cheap details
5855 2018-02-25 17:59:27 Why is it a dumb question ? If we produce this much why don't we use more of it for ourselves instead of buying foreign oil ?
5856 2018-02-25 17:59:09 After 1.1 holes at PGA Honda Classic, Tiger Woods may be overmatched vs Sam Burns.
5857 2018-02-25 17:59:05 That oil money is to much for them to take lol
5858 2018-02-25 17:58:36 Justin Welby was a senior guy in the oil industry and these days is in touch with just about anyone who's opinion counts.
5859 2018-02-25 17:58:23 Agreed on the above tug-of-war re: USD factors & timing, & question of how much is factored in.  Hopefully my explanation of EM BoP wrt gold/oil in CNY made sense about how it can be used to prevent EM BoP crisis for China, & theoretically how it can b used to ctrl USDs int'l val
5860 2018-02-25 17:58:09 Its different,i make it like,heat d oil&thn put cumin seed&asafoetida,put potato& on slow flame fry it till it gt crispy,anothr recipe is add tomato in2 it&some onion,plain salty&crispy paratha

5861 2018-02-25 17:57:40 Wenger is going to get such a boner talking about oil money after this
5862 2018-02-25 17:57:33 The Wizard of Oz is a much better story when the Tin Man is an elite sniper with a Chaissepot needlefire rifle that uses liquid propellant from his oil can, and he provides precision cover fire as Dorothy sabotages the Monkey AA batteries.
5863 2018-02-25 17:57:26 Been saying this for long, David Silva has been City's best signing since the oil money. What a player...

5866 2018-02-25 17:56:56 Yeah.. beans with no red oil , plantain.. just just
5867 2018-02-25 17:56:10 a blender works too, but it's annoying to have to clean it afterwards---the oil sticks to everything
5868 2018-02-25 17:56:06 The last thing this club needed to do was re-sign Letestu. Was a fairly solid free agent signing but no way the Oilers should have brought him back.
5869 2018-02-25 17:56:05 Yeah they are more like oil rigs for sure.
5870 2018-02-25 17:56:04 Fucking Oil money

5881 2018-02-25 17:55:01 Castor oil is known to be a natural antibacterial!  Try applying castor oil to your skin once a day after you've washed it with warm water. Leave on overnight and rinse off in the morning to prevent dry and acne filled skin!

5884 2018-02-25 17:54:37 Yup. Follow the oil and it will lead to the money trail.
5885 2018-02-25 17:54:29 Fr?  i just got a oil change
5886 2018-02-25 17:54:23 2nd one, but could the quarantine cities be "anchored" instead of 'perched'? I envisioned them like oil rigs in the gulf...
5887 2018-02-25 17:54:00 Arsenal getting beat by a club with no history but oil money...21st century football though

5889 2018-02-25 17:53:46 hahaha. Like what?
5890 2018-02-25 17:53:32 Yup. It’s always oil
5891 2018-02-25 17:53:28 ถึงห้องแล้วน้า ขอบคุณมากจ้าา
5892 2018-02-25 17:53:20 China's willingness to credibly settle CNY balances in phys gold means oil exporters are willing to sell oil in CNY (Russia, Iran, Venez, maybe Saudi soon?)  If so, then PBOC can adjust CNY Gold/Oil ratio to adjust the cost of oil imports to keep China's Current Acct positive.
5893 2018-02-25 17:52:55 If you need an oil cartridge today, Oleum is 20% off today!

5895 2018-02-25 17:52:19 Zo meteen komt hier iemand vertellen hoe Big Oil de elektrische auto heeft laten verdwijnen na een succesvolle testfase.
5896 2018-02-25 17:52:15 Or if I use like. Coconut oil I'll put it in my bath when I'm done. Just transfer all the good stuff back into my skin lmao
5897 2018-02-25 17:52:07 I haven't eaten mammals since 1990 and I make carbonara w turkey bacon or turkey ham. Chop it smallish and fry in olive oil to get the flavor in the oil.fry it crispy, it will soften a bit when added back

5901 2018-02-25 17:51:30 Mr President of the United States, what I AM trying to say is look at Genie Oil & Gas board members. Cheney,a Bush Thug, Murdoch,owner of Fake news in six continents...   All tied to Israel... Once the can is opened,the contents will fall out when turned upside down...bad & bad..
5902 2018-02-25 17:51:28 It’s cold and wet and rainy and I just want a giant bowl of ramen with hot oil. The bowl has to be the size of my head at least.
5903 2018-02-25 17:51:27 Not sure if I wouldn't have rathered the 4th the Preds got from Columbus for Letestu instead of Pontus Aberg but understand Chiarelli's mindset. I believe he has come to the realization that solving Oilers issue via the trade market wouldn't be easy...even with extra picks.
5904 2018-02-25 17:51:27 Stretch: borrow vessels and pour what you have (your oil) into it for you determine how far you walk into the promises of God over your life. #greatword #tresholdchurchhull

5906 2018-02-25 17:51:15 Worst car owner ever, after 11k miles I finally got an oil change yesterday... no more engine knock & driving like it did when I bought it a yr ago the last time it probably had one. 
5907 2018-02-25 17:51:10 Dear me educating the right. Yes there is corruption in Venezuela, but then there is corruption in every political movement in the world. - So what else went wrong, well any economy reliant on oil, that suddenly finds prices have collapsed is going to suffer.

5910 2018-02-25 17:50:54 It's so strange how the US military goes around destabilizing governments, violently preventing the spread of socialism and stealing oil; yet every single person in the military says they're "traveling around the world", like it's an adventurous vacation or something.
5911 2018-02-25 17:50:35 Put mint oil on it. Massage it a little bit. Do it repeatedly until it heals. Something with mint or eucalyptus.
5912 2018-02-25 17:50:32 Fair play to big Vinny, was at City before all the oil money and buying success, hard not to like the big man

5915 2018-02-25 17:50:12 I intend to start packaging and selling natural and organic skincare ingredients like coconut oil, olive oil, shea butter, black soap, essential oils. The least amount I need is 20k for buying and packaging these materials. Mail is ifeling3@gmail.com
5916 2018-02-25 17:50:09 Olbas oil is a gift from god
5917 2018-02-25 17:50:09 I do, but probably not like others. I stuff dates with coconut oil and freeze them. (My longer races are usually in cooler weather, so not as likely to melt)

5920 2018-02-25 17:50:02 Arsenal is just pant. Oil no they there head at all. The team needs hostile take over.
5921 2018-02-25 17:50:01 Omg did The Simpsons predict the production of palm oil leading to mass deforestation click here
5922 2018-02-25 17:49:59 The #1 fundamental is....We use oil. We have oil. Should we refine it and use it? If not how long until we can stop using it? Until that time will we will need a supply. Does the existing pipe serve our needs ?
5923 2018-02-25 17:49:52 EM BoP Crisis theory is based on IMF "Reserve Adequacy" math (ie does the EM in question have enough USD-denominated FX to buy critical imports, & when it runs out of FX reserves = BoP crisis.)  If China can print CNY for oil, other critical imports, BoP crisis becomes impossible
5924 2018-02-25 17:49:35 Some people will say you can't have anything serious going in the house then later say it's the best place to start a relationship. That not being enough saying you can pee oil...na wa ooh...#BBNaija
5925 2018-02-25 17:49:22 I like Kompany, he’s been there since before the oil rigs turned up. Proper player & man
5926 2018-02-25 17:49:21 I love a veggie option to be fair. They were so nice, made home made wedges cover in oil and red pesto x

5928 2018-02-25 17:48:52 im sure any kind of cooking oil will do

5932 2018-02-25 17:48:25 Thank you for stating what is obvious. It’s like never letting the old door-to-door salesmen put their foot in the door to ease their way into the home. Mom ALWAYS met them on the front porch. That’s how I treat PEDDLING politicians with their snake oil LIES. 
5933 2018-02-25 17:48:25 Big Oil scientist claimed for decades that lead in gas was safe... finally Congress stood up to big money... for a day.
5934 2018-02-25 17:48:23 Wouldn’t have this problem if you have done the oil changes on a regular basis as scheduled too

5939 2018-02-25 17:48:01 Just read up on Sam Burns.  Impressive amateur record and got royally screwed by political Walker Cup snub.  Will be Sam fan going forward.  Today, however, I bet The King Tiger Woods -190 vs Sam as Tigermania seems to be in full swing. Good luck to both. Honda Classic.  PGA.
5940 2018-02-25 17:47:53 Lol. Have you smelled neem oil? Girrrrl!
5941 2018-02-25 17:47:50 Fuck off with your stupid oil money
5942 2018-02-25 17:47:46 @AutoNews_GTI if it does not void the auto manufacturer's warranty, recommend using Mobile 1 Annual Performance Oil (20,000 miles or 1 year).  I highly recommend it.  I have used it in my car and it has performed exceptional for $ 20,000 miles or 1 year.
5943 2018-02-25 17:47:43 Tax oil!

5946 2018-02-25 17:46:47 Donald repeat this, the Republican credo is “oil greed war destruction of the environment and lack of compassion and empathy. Needing a crib sheet at all times to pretend to be a human being
5947 2018-02-25 17:46:46 Actually we could stop using oil, gas, fuel, electricity, etc all together TODAY and we’d still exceed our carbon equivalent GGHG emissions by 2030 JUST from LIVESTOCK production ALONE. lmao.
5948 2018-02-25 17:46:45 @ProcterGamble noticed a kiosk sampling your new Oil of Olay Whipped facial cream. Don’t use your products but was interested. Now I know why I don’t use your products..the scent. OMG it’s like wearing perfume on your face. It was awful. Will never buy.
5949 2018-02-25 17:46:45 ........WE ALSO RENDER HOME SERVICE DELIVERY

5953 2018-02-25 17:46:28 Thanks Letestu. You were a great soldier for the Oil and I wish you the best in your playoff run. And Aberg is a real player!!! If Test Tube comes back in the summer I won't be surprised
5954 2018-02-25 17:46:26 Mustafi, Xhaka, and Perez for £100M, but Wenger can’t compete with the oil money

5956 2018-02-25 17:46:08 Step 1: invest in crude oil

5959 2018-02-25 17:45:44 I honestly feel like #crud but went into high sanitizing mode again this morning - washed bedding; wiped all touchable surfaces with alcohol including phones, remotes and keyboard; running homemade thieves oil in diffuser.
5960 2018-02-25 17:45:37 They are sold to the dollers made by syrian oil. #Humanity
5961 2018-02-25 17:45:32 Yep. And it’s the same across the nation. After years of neglect (purposeful or not) and stagnant funding, our infrastructure is falling apart. We need to start thinking about it from a lifecycle perspective. “It’s much cheaper to change the oil in a car than buy a new engine.”

5969 2018-02-25 17:44:19 People's lives can only change (keyword) when when Nigeria focuses on research in military, health, agriculture and economics. This is how the super-powers developed. Not by GDP or oil reserves or economy alone. Your Excellency, let that change begin from me.

5972 2018-02-25 17:43:52 coconut oil, no heat, and vitamins should help..i haven’t straightened my hair in 55 days and all I use in my hair is coconut oil and my hair is longer than what it was back in November
5973 2018-02-25 17:43:49 That is incorrect. He lived in Russia for several years while working for Merrill Lynch. Not to mention his time advising a Russian oil company. You obviously didn't read either memo yourself. The investigation is two fold to determine Russian meddling and improper contacts.
5974 2018-02-25 17:43:46 @realDonaldTrump, @POTUS, where are the #RussianSanctions?  You know they are shipping oil to DPRK via Vladivostok, right? #ENFORCEtheSANCTIONS, #ENFORCETHESANCTIONS #ENFORCETHESANCTIONS NOW!!!

5982 2018-02-25 17:42:54 It turns out losing an oil cap will result in three trips to various car shops and a trip to the local breakers. Still it’s better than your car bursting into flames on the M25 #carwoes
5983 2018-02-25 17:42:47 Same way the mafia gets all of its money.  Preying on anything possible. Extortion, conspiracy, treason, preying on its own citizens, Oil, real estate and probably now, bitcoin, will make it easier.
5984 2018-02-25 17:42:44 When Indg people stand at the front lines of environmental protests against oil lines and fracking, they are trying to protect the world in a way that will benefit us all. You're wilfully blind if you haven't seen the solidarity Indigenous people show to other minorities

5993 2018-02-25 17:41:56 They are a gun manufacturers lobby masquerading as a members org. They are just like the the coal lobby or the oil lobby - only much much worse.

5995 2018-02-25 17:41:39 Clearly, modern car designers have never actually worked on a car.

5999 2018-02-25 17:41:03 the food you just ate had a lot of oil or you went for a swim & had no lotion afterwards..
6000 2018-02-25 17:41:02 I do that as well. If my scalp wasn't so dry and itchy, I wouldn't even wash it that often. Just oil it and leave it

6004 2018-02-25 17:40:31 You are mistaken. Fish is obviously a good food source for plenty of reasons, but concentrated fish oil delivers higher doses of specific nutrients in targeted ratios for more benefits.

6015 2018-02-25 17:39:38 cute line — some consultant really earned his paycheck on that one. It’s a funny definition of “leading the way for Coloradans” that includes allowing billion-dollar Texas oil & gas companies to drill wherever they want and poison Coloradans in their homes

6018 2018-02-25 17:39:02 You have not proved me wrong, you stated that it was a crash in oil prices in the 1970s, you also said I was making things up regarding the IMF. I thought I was debating a grown up, obviously not.
6019 2018-02-25 17:38:56 If Glenn Beck was still making money at The Blaze as the conspiracy theorist he was, he’d still be doing it. He’s piss off too many in the Tea Party & far right & he doesn’t make money anymore. He’s a snake oil salesman on to the next grift.
6020 2018-02-25 17:38:33 So he violated FB terms for a start. Equally it's against the law to knowingly violate Fed/ state laws even in private sale.

6022 2018-02-25 17:37:29 Trump is the last gasp of a flailing GOP and declining white Evangelical church. These white men are old and out of touch. They are touting 1950s cultural ideology as “Christian;” millennials aren’t buying their snake oil.

6029 2018-02-25 17:36:09 I haven't actually, wouldn't even know where to start with where to get it either and to be honest I haven't done much research on it. I'm bad enough admitting and giving in when I need morphine let alone cbd oil. I like to think I'm progressive but I guess not lol

6036 2018-02-25 17:35:08 Oh for Christsake Salon.
6037 2018-02-25 17:35:01 Do any of these dispensaries/growers recycle the oil containers cause jfc. Can only buy 1g at a time and, unless you get the stuff in paper and enjoy wasting half the dab cause it won’t come off, they come in tiny ass plastic jars. Legal weed is such a bitch for pollution.
6038 2018-02-25 17:34:56 The girl body was so oily I don't see how he could hold on to her. And he was pouring more oil on her. But I see ur point.

6063 2018-02-25 17:31:29 The amorphous concept of a Mediterranean diet has always been a canard. Marketers love to point to olive oil and quickly swap it for canola/soybean.
6064 2018-02-25 17:31:19 Our World is a physical structure pushed forth by the molten, liquid seas, rivers and lakes, energies seen, unseen, spiritual forces. gold silver, copper, oil and other precocious metals, gems and amazing rocks, mountains, hills, flowers;, much more for humankind to experience.
6065 2018-02-25 17:31:18 The part that resonates the most is Daniel Plainview’s empty promises to the town about how oil will make everything better. Education! Progress. Oklahomans are those townspeople.
6066 2018-02-25 17:31:12 Ah that sucks.  Not sure if any other solutions. What about Moroccan Oil maybe?
6067 2018-02-25 17:31:04 it's almost like we need another word for meat/nuts/yogurt/olive oil 'fat'. Immediately people think 'overweight' when they hear 'fat'.

6069 2018-02-25 17:30:47 While I am sympathetic to the idea of upgrading bitumen and shipping light oil, that isn’t the point. The point is that Weaver shouldn’t violate the constitution as the premier of a province. He’s breaking the law. He’d look good in jail. #cdnpoli

6076 2018-02-25 17:29:59 It is the sad truth, but hey.... at least I have gain my own independence from it. I have proven to myself that I don’t need a man to “take out the trash for me” or “clean the snow off my car”, or “changing my oil.” I am fully capable of doing it myself.
6077 2018-02-25 17:29:44 Oh $#!+!!!!! I just remembered I had coffee at dinner!!! No essential oil blends can actually counter a "Barako"! WTF!!!

6084 2018-02-25 17:28:42 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other
6085 2018-02-25 17:28:38 Yes the World needs to consume less Fossil Fuels to save this Planet. As we transition, the Demand for Oil will be less therefore the need to maintain dollars is less & therefore the value of the dollar decreases. So to will the US' ability to borrow; print money.

6091 2018-02-25 17:27:51 The composition of crude oil varies depending on its age, source, and location. It is classified into three basic types: 1) paraffin-based crudes, 2) naphthenic-based crudes and 3) mixed-based crudes. #LatAmNRG #petroleum

6101 2018-02-25 17:26:51 You can find tincture or oil at most vape shops!! I sometimes put a drop or 2 in my water or just under my tongue and after a few days it helps tremendously!!
6102 2018-02-25 17:26:49 Anyone else out there believe the story that Gull Island in Alaska, has more oil than anywhere else in history? And that will lead the US into a new age of prosperity, just when we think we are nearing depression type years?

6105 2018-02-25 17:26:33 Venezuela under siege w/ sanctions by US senate due to their vast supplies of crude oil posing great risk to US economy. Venezuela suffering from Americans, dubious leadership and over reliance on oil. Not comparable economies.  Bolivia enjoying rapid growth under socialist gov

6107 2018-02-25 17:26:26 Who's the Idiot that thinks an OIL COMPANY has "HUMAN" rights ??.
6108 2018-02-25 17:26:22 My Grandma use to always say “You Can’t Out Slick a Can Of Oil”
6109 2018-02-25 17:26:16 Best sunbed oil / cream ?!

6111 2018-02-25 17:26:03 Its a direct correlation: The USD is presently considered the global Reserve Currency; the choice currency for Oil Trading. Im not stating it always was & always will be. But much of the USD's value comes from the need of Countries to maintain Dollar Reserves to buy Oil. 1/2
6112 2018-02-25 17:26:00 Thats how i see it too QT= USD pos, deficit/lack of confidence = USD neg. Just a battle timing & how much is factored in already imo

wrt simultaneous convertibility of CNY gold & CNY oil. Hox does that make it impossible to have an EM BoP crisis / enable them to control $?

6116 2018-02-25 17:25:37 Some of us are properly educated and realize that climate change and evolution are real. Sadly our GOP reps in DC keep voting to grab all the oil possible and do nothing to move us out of the 1800s.
6117 2018-02-25 17:24:57 I didn’t hear that, although Chis Cuthbert as a former Storm owner often talks up Storm connections on air.  He talked about Pius Suter playing on the Storm and him being on the 2014 Memorial Cup team that lost to the Edmonton Oil Kings.
6118 2018-02-25 17:24:56 They want that.  Alaska, Texas & Louisiana Want Independence from US so they can keep Oil Profits!
6119 2018-02-25 17:24:53 My oil change light came on ):
6120 2018-02-25 17:24:10 Simply owning the land and machines means the profits of all exctracted oil will line my pockets yes? I will become very rich, correct? Oil is whats on everyones minds....im swooping in!
6121 2018-02-25 17:23:59 Could of picked up Letestu too.  Say what you want to about him and most of the Oil this season but he was fantastic last year in the playoffs.  PK, face off, defensive prowess.
6122 2018-02-25 17:23:46 Also "It turned out that it had been written by the good folks at Devon Energy, a local oil and gas company. And Pruitt had taken their words, and put it on his letterhead, and passed it onto the EPA as the official position of the state. And he did the same thing with letters...
6123 2018-02-25 17:23:44 Some of those players..... You an Oil fan? Must be hard.
6124 2018-02-25 17:23:39 Lookjng for “oil”
6125 2018-02-25 17:23:35 And I'm not sure the goal of trades is to always be the winner. I can think they overpaid, but if all the pieces fit -- so be it.

6127 2018-02-25 17:23:25 Do they prioritize oil because it pays better? Or what is the reason for oil over grain? I don't buy the winter excuse even a little.
6128 2018-02-25 17:23:18 Actually Kung Pao as hot as possible. Low mein works if I add tons of pepper seeds from Chinese Hot oil.
6129 2018-02-25 17:23:09 I'm aware of how audiophile snake oil combined with technological illiteracy, confirmation bias, and piss poor CD mastering to cause a resurgence in vinyl record (not redundant) sales. Some friends released a cassette recently. I didn't know anyone was still making 1/4" tape!
6130 2018-02-25 17:23:09 Also try lavender oil. Put the oil on your pillow and you will sleep like a baby!! It will knock you out
6131 2018-02-25 17:23:06 And I guess the oil companies fight for you to pay higher gas prices and the pharmacy companies fight so people can be drug addicts the NRA fights for the rights to protect your family and homes from the ones that will hurt them
6132 2018-02-25 17:23:02 'we refused to end the bloodbath in Syria'. The naiveté of this comment astounds me. As if Western govs, who helped destabilise the region in their effort to control oil, and who sell weapons to Arab dictators, have the capacity or inclination to end Middle Eastern bloodbaths
6133 2018-02-25 17:22:57 Why are we spending $115,000,000,000. to import oil when we produce oil. Why doesn't Alberta build a refinery and sell it's oil to Canadians ?

6143 2018-02-25 17:21:11 Tea tree oil is very potent. Nak guna dia kena dilute kan dulu. For example, campur sikit dengan moisturizer baru sapu. Ataupun ambik cotton bud, celup dalam moisturizer/air. Then letak tea tree oil kat cotton bud tu, baru sapu kat jerawat/spots/clogged pores.

6152 2018-02-25 17:19:51 Yes Mr President of USA, I get it, we went into Iraq to stop Iraq from being the Strongest Arab Country Wealth projected to rise. So looting the gold & oil was in order. NOW its Iran who will be the strongest Arab Country. Is that why US harasses Iran now? Ready to knock em over.

Freedom of speech isn't being outlawed, nor is there any refusal to hear the other side. It's just a live and let live scenario.

However ... if customers aren't funded = no oil companies.

6216 2018-02-25 17:10:12 Oil companies are motivated by profits.  They are concerned about the price of their Woodstock not whether it has made in Alberta stamped on it.  Build refineries not more crude exporting pipelines.

6227 2018-02-25 17:08:48 India is 80 per cent dependent on imports to meet its oil needs.

 India's dependence on the Middle East for its crude oil needs has increased from 58 per cent in 2014-15 to 63.5 per cent in the April-October period of this fiscal.
6228 2018-02-25 17:08:45 Are you stating a bullish case for USD based on the need to change yuan/gold into dollars from oil sold to china?

6248 2018-02-25 17:07:03 Coconut oil is the best way to take off my makeup because of my eczema but it’s always leaves me a bit blurry eyed/blind for half an hour or so
6249 2018-02-25 17:06:58 John, it's happening. The revolution is underway. Venezuela has been a socialist society for many years, and look at the roaring success that country (with the World's 2nd largest reserves of oil) has made of it. Absolutely breathtaking. And I mean breathtaking.

6261 2018-02-25 17:05:27 I'm starting off this #SundayMorning by finding out we ran out of oil last night and I'm now freezing! Good times, good times.
6262 2018-02-25 17:05:26 So what is not in the headline.  Necessary maintenance to prevent a larger discharge.  Half of what was previous predicted, owing to previous work.  Although unpleasant sewage will naturally break down, bitumen/oil will not.  READ THE WHOLE ARTICLE
6263 2018-02-25 17:05:17 The Demand for Oil directly impacts the Value of the Dollar. 
Yes we must choose the planet & during the interim when the US is reduced to poverty; cant defend itself, I hope the rest of the world will show humility.
6264 2018-02-25 17:05:00 I agree you should check, but only BC assuming ppl do their jobs well or correct is silly. I knew a girl who’s care caught fire after an oil change BC the dorks working on it didn’t put oil back in after draining it. Guess what I check after each oil change nowadays?
6265 2018-02-25 17:04:49 it’s 2018 and i’m still seeing nonblack moms complain about how their kids’ hair is difficult to handle because they’re half black. loose curls is the easiest hair to manage second to straight hair. water, oil, conditioner, and wide tooth combs. get with the program.

6276 2018-02-25 17:02:29 If i were in charge of the forests and streams i would do anything to protect them. But id also protect my country, and the economy is our well-being...its time to drill for oil and make thousands for our nation
6277 2018-02-25 17:02:27 I added some orange oil to my diffuser to get me energized and focused to study and it fucking spilled everywhere. Happy Sunday
6278 2018-02-25 17:02:16 Oil isn't a fossil fuel, and the companies responsible for scouting new oil reserves are largely controlled by the CIA. Since oil and various "fossil" fuels are the primary driver in industrialized economies, controlling the supply allows you to control the overarching system.

Ah, the smell of oil, the morning light.
There's but one shadow cast on the asphalt.
6285 2018-02-25 17:01:14 $APGI claimed on 8/15/17 pr that oil prices below $50 per barrel affected business. Well its been above $50 every month and in fact a solid upward trend which means their bottom-line might have improved.  I am tempted to add more here but will wait for PR any moment
6286 2018-02-25 17:01:00 How can u even think that?  So pathetic and sad how distorted your view is especially of a young guy who WITNESSED 17 classmates and teachers shot and others injured

6290 2018-02-25 17:00:29 Imagine what would happen for instance if California went full socialist and decided they wanted to succeed. Then they decided to begin negotiations with countries such as Venezuela for oil. That opens the door to China. Then Hawaii joins in. Liberalism is Socialism in disguise.
6291 2018-02-25 17:00:29 Pavements can become very slippery in the first 10 to 15 minutes of a rain storm. Rain causes oil in the asphalt to come to the surface. Reduce your speed in wet weather! #ArriveAlive
6292 2018-02-25 17:00:28 Excellent point, which I also have stated many times, With Alaska oil supply from Prudhoe Bay dwindling, WA State refineries (via TMP branch at Sumas) & coastal California refineries seeking new source. All have cokers installed & KM twin logical new supply in terms of logistics.

6307 2018-02-25 16:59:15 Australia and Malaysia have signed a trade agreement for oil exploration for export to China.
6308 2018-02-25 16:59:03 Excellent point. Big Oil, in Canada, ain’t actually big. On the other hand, foreign funded Big Enviro here is goliath-sized. It’s big, smart, rich and unprincipled. Different from what the majority of Canadians believe or assume. #bcpoli #cdnpoli
6309 2018-02-25 16:59:02 Soot from burning oil and coal - and now a president who wants to make them great again...
6310 2018-02-25 16:58:51 US shale also doesn't compete with Saudi oil, but supply is limited by resource endowments and productive capacity, so shale is setting the price over the medium term
6311 2018-02-25 16:58:49 Mr President of the Untied States- When Israel exploits 40 billion barrels of Oil & the unlimited gas from Golan Heights Syria.  How many jobs does that bring to America?  All that money goes to Oil Tycoons,like the ones you had on your staff then fired. WHAT! not even a janitor!

6358 2018-02-25 16:52:27 800 years ago, Earl’s and Duke’s could earn land, mineral rights, water rights by making cavalry and swordsmen available to the King for war and territorial control. Putin apparently has copied this today with Oligarchs, oil and mercenaries in Syria.

6387 2018-02-25 16:49:02 Hello honey i work in the oil rig in lagos i will love to be your lover,call me at +2348100622645
6388 2018-02-25 16:48:48 @john_gibbs48 think about it. It took the oil industry less than 50 yrs to build the interstate & get behind gas cars and their services with your tax money....
6389 2018-02-25 16:48:33 The NSea oil boom destroyed our manufacturing base, by hardening the pound!
6390 2018-02-25 16:48:32 Ask your daddy what brown coats I'm talking about maybe he didn't teach you the proper terminology oil putting you through your socialist indoctrination...
6391 2018-02-25 16:48:26 Saute them in truffle oil first. 

I wonder if most Trekkies applauded him or rolled their eyes into the permanently stuck position.
6392 2018-02-25 16:48:24 Sir Dicky Dearlove, a director of the oil company Kosmos Energy. A member of the Henry Jackson Society, which advocates international intervention. As the Head of MI6 severely criticised in the Chilcot Report, for the infamous dossier Has he genuine concerns or other motivations?
6393 2018-02-25 16:48:22 Sorry just saw this if you want I'll call or go with you to get it just hit the the auto store don't matter and ask for the oil and oil filter for your car make sure it's a 5 quart

6395 2018-02-25 16:48:21 kaastig naman ng air fryer  no need oil para sa pag luluto ng fries hihi
6396 2018-02-25 16:48:14 Brazil and Russia and China are spending $ trillions. Upgrading infrastructure at port and rail lines to move product more efficiently. Without upgrades our grain will have  disadvantage just like Canadian oil
6397 2018-02-25 16:48:03 Sunday Brunch inspiration ~ vegetables braised in olive oil, with cumin seeds, garam masala and sea salt :) #simplicity #vegan #vegetarian
6398 2018-02-25 16:47:24 He's a worm. A charlatan selling snake oil for clicks. 

Anybody associated with him damages their credibility.
6399 2018-02-25 16:47:21 if you really want to minimize stretch marks, Bio Oil is it. Want a solution to hyper pigmentation Bio Oil as well.
6400 2018-02-25 16:47:05 I plan on dying before the end of the ocean on an oil rig.
6401 2018-02-25 16:47:02 Depends. If the prospect is someone they're 100% sold on sure but if it's not a slam dunk, the pick gives them more options. It actually has value as a trade chip, prospect likely does not.
6402 2018-02-25 16:46:33 Good luck making that oil and gas money
6403 2018-02-25 16:46:30 Motor oil shad
6404 2018-02-25 16:46:23 Why do we use palm oil anyway? Aren’t there alternatives.
6405 2018-02-25 16:46:10 Have u ever considered why "Big OIL" has so much influence? imo: The PetroDollar; We r in a trap of perpetual war b/c the value of the dollar is dependent upon the demand for oil. We have a choice: Save the Planet & be a Country of Paupers or Save the Dollar & Die While Trying.
6406 2018-02-25 16:46:01 Today I start my coconut trial = I will test a lipbalm that contains coconut oil for a few days and see if I’m allergic. Wish me luck! 
6407 2018-02-25 16:46:00 He'll have lots of opportunities. Whether that's ever back into politics or a board position in an oil/gas/resource company it's not going to be hard.
6408 2018-02-25 16:45:46 I ain't got no reason to bs u. I got the truck when it had 102000 miles on it. And i aint dont shit to it besides oil and breaks! That dont be the previous owner didnt
6409 2018-02-25 16:45:37 Perhaps, still seems a heavy deal from one end.
6410 2018-02-25 16:45:27 His religious beliefs are nothing but the worship of money from corrupt oil companies. He will destroy the world thinking all his money will save him. It won’t he is not above the effects of the disaster he created
6411 2018-02-25 16:45:26 Coconut oil is magical though.
It just isn’t for some things. 
6412 2018-02-25 16:45:15 Pls give me the link to stream
6413 2018-02-25 16:45:02 the devilz of the west wont interfere in DRC conflict, 
guess what?they ain't muslims and no oil
6414 2018-02-25 16:44:59 And I love it. How many people have never heard quite except for the night critter sounds or the wind coming through the trees or the billions of stars seen on a clear night.We in Oklahoma will furnish you gas, oil, and wind power. Even if you hate us.
6415 2018-02-25 16:44:58 Remember this is a Bish with a background in the oil industry & City finance before joining the church.  Chosen by Cameron as he thought that cv would mean he sang from the same hymnbook.

6417 2018-02-25 16:44:47 Background: Before this scene, Jesus had raised Lazarus from the dead. So now, they're sitting together... Jesus, Lazarus, Mary, and Martha. Mary decided to anoint Jesus' feet with expensive oil instead of just washing his feet (as the custom). @SMZBC
6418 2018-02-25 16:44:37 Oil wealth may not be evenly disbursed under your current autocrat, but wait til Exxon appropriates it and siphons 90% of the profits. Venezuela is caught in a lose/lose situation and the people (as always) pay the price.
6419 2018-02-25 16:44:36 Quantity doesn't always add up to quality & from an assert standpoint, had to chip in a little extra to move an unwanted contract.
6420 2018-02-25 16:44:31 Follow the money trail that leads to OIL! I've been telling you guys. It's all about that oil.
6421 2018-02-25 16:44:20 I find your use of the letter 'u' suspicious. Are you *foreign*? ... do you have oil? We can give you freedom if you have oil.
6422 2018-02-25 16:44:16 Stop the FUD. U know how many people were killed for oil?
6423 2018-02-25 16:44:11 Ill bet that thin layer of oil keeps the wind off.
6424 2018-02-25 16:44:05 เหนื่อย... อยู่ๆก็ขยันไปล้างตู้เก็บจานหลังบ้านเฉย งงตัวเองเว่อ

6427 2018-02-25 16:43:21 Mark this tweet after 10 years or less ..no one will care about oil..
6428 2018-02-25 16:43:16 I’ve been searching and coming up with nothing! I’m trying to see if there are jobs as oil girls. People who oil up celebrities before shoots or concerts

6430 2018-02-25 16:42:59 Wow!! All this in one product!!! 
Drop a 1 to get your Dream on!  @Stepp it up with CBD Hemp Oil
6431 2018-02-25 16:42:46 Invest crores in sea exploration for more oil n gas..no use for general public!
6432 2018-02-25 16:42:44 That pure coconut oil is something serious.
6433 2018-02-25 16:42:26 Think Progress yeah right.
6434 2018-02-25 16:42:19 Because christian countries waged war on them for their natural resources like oil & committed a massacre & now all they have is a destroyed country & therefore they are risking their lives to immagriate to europe. BTW your ancestors done the same thing during WW2 any comment?
6435 2018-02-25 16:42:17 I got prescribed this fish oil thing to improve my concentration/energy and I now that I've taken it I'll never be free of the taste of fish. everything smells like fish. there is fish everywhere. I may be becoming a fish
6436 2018-02-25 16:41:55 4th step of Samaritan is to heal. Oil has 2 functions. Wine and oil healed and protected from infection. #sermon #pcusa
6437 2018-02-25 16:41:53 Use the sauna with eucalyptus oil and have a couple drops of oregano oil at night in a cup of water
6438 2018-02-25 16:41:52 Regarding the oil crisis our side have obviously been playing the card of pressuring Turkey through other countries. This was never going to work. Only the direct approach between the 2 leaders will have any chance of a breakthrough to reestablishing communications.
6439 2018-02-25 16:41:50 #BakwenaN1N4 #Caution alert - slow lane closed N1 north after Pumulani due to oil spillage clean-up.  Please approach with caution.
6440 2018-02-25 16:41:43 Oil+gas, also state spending almost exclusively on armanents intelligence warfare and the like so punch above weight in these areas. If Italy provided no public services and spent only on say swimming pools it could afford a lot of pools. Seems Trump/NRA are trying same in USA

6442 2018-02-25 16:41:27 Ethiopia is rising part 2

-fashion and entertainment industries are booming 

Smile Ethiopia!
6443 2018-02-25 16:41:15 @KFC_UKI  Your food has went down hill rapid in the recent months, soaked in oil, cold & very over cooked #falkirkstore also the staff is very rude going through the drive through and don’t care as they over fill the juice and spill it over you and your car and think it’s ok.. 
6444 2018-02-25 16:41:09 Congrats! That means your undocumented AR15 will get free housing, safe space, soy oil, schooling, money, food, an Obama phone & health care!
6445 2018-02-25 16:41:05  right those are oil and park wings because garlic WHERE ! But I was so hungry I just ate it smh
6446 2018-02-25 16:40:58 I was stocking up on baby oil actually, mind your own
6447 2018-02-25 16:40:43 The struggle of being a afro/curly haired hijabi...When u don't want your hair to be dying of drought, but u can't deal with oil stains, and your protective styles ruining your hijab no longer 
6448 2018-02-25 16:40:34 #UniqueWaysToAvoidTheFlu change your regular aftershave to oil of Olbas......
6449 2018-02-25 16:40:26 the power of Olive oil & bagi gue makanan harus ada ijo2nya. Minimal daun bawang atau seledri... hihihi
6450 2018-02-25 16:40:15 多分とんでもない額要求される

6453 2018-02-25 16:39:59 Real Cheap - I will get one too.  I drink a spoon of olive Oil in morning if It is of high quality  and use for salad -not sure if I can cook in it like the italians do-recently also got avocado Oil  for a change.
6454 2018-02-25 16:39:42 Mourning too long will cause you to lose your oil
6455 2018-02-25 16:39:41 After I get my oil change it’s a day out with the kiddos
6456 2018-02-25 16:39:34 กูคืนจรณไปแล้ว!!!
6457 2018-02-25 16:39:34 from what i know coconut oil is used to seal moisture not bring it so, no
6458 2018-02-25 16:39:30 Luke 10:34
" and he went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. And having placed him on his own beast, he brought him to an inn, and looked after him. "

6460 2018-02-25 16:39:18 At ACE they have cheap oil paints 
6461 2018-02-25 16:39:17 That seems like a lot for a 33 year old with 28 points and an expiring contract. I can see the first rd pick, maybe a player attached, but 3 players and a pick seems a fair bit of an overpayment.
6462 2018-02-25 16:39:10 Tiap pagi&malem ngolesin bio oil ke bekas luka kecelakaan kemaren, semoga ngefek yah
6463 2018-02-25 16:39:05 Btw that black castor oil/ flaxseed oil gel is garbage ...that shit takes mad long to try and barely has any hold
6464 2018-02-25 16:38:59 wow it’s 12:38 am and i want white wine and baguette w a bit of olive oil and gouda
6465 2018-02-25 16:38:54 Also, a well-seasoned cast iron skillet doesn’t need much oil. I didn’t use any here. Sometimes I add a little butter at the end.
6466 2018-02-25 16:38:45 All depends on the prospect,if he’s close to being ready to play it’s a better option than a pick.
6467 2018-02-25 16:38:44 iirc coconut oil is toxic to cats so you shouldnt
6468 2018-02-25 16:38:19 I have never seen such beautiful handwriting. Screw the oil...I must find that typestyle. Kidding.. I want both.
6469 2018-02-25 16:38:17 And the GOP commits so many legislative atrocities, there wouldn't be room to report it all.
What else are they up to?
Reducing funding for mental health services, replacing protection for national forests with legislation  allowing deforestation, oil pipelines, construction...
6470 2018-02-25 16:38:15 I like how in addition to not wearing shirt, it also looks like he rubbed his chest down with baby oil. Good lord.
6471 2018-02-25 16:38:11 Cobalt is the new oil ...

6473 2018-02-25 16:38:04 See the way Kun is entering our defense like groundnut oil
6474 2018-02-25 16:38:03 Honestly that’s the part I don’t get. Disinformation campaign or no, he’s so utterly transparent for the disgusting snake oil con that he is.
6475 2018-02-25 16:37:58 sanie sojnds like a cooking oil beand

6481 2018-02-25 16:37:00 When Individuals like ur self allocate to yourself and friends Oil well worth Billion of US dollars, in country where majority can not eat 3 square meal, over population is what u get.
6482 2018-02-25 16:36:59 Rather the 2nd round pick.
6483 2018-02-25 16:36:49 abbachio drinks oil to dye his insides black to be extra goth

6488 2018-02-25 16:36:23 I don't smoke either but CND oil saved my friend.  She was giving 6mns after cancer treatments & turn to this oil.That was 1 yr ago.
6489 2018-02-25 16:36:21 We spend mega-money on fighting ISIS cuz we care about safety while voting against keeping AR’s from murdering our own ppl. Well, that is so MAGA  “They should have gotten the oil”, said Trump. Like oil and gun sales, it’s about not safety or lives.
6490 2018-02-25 16:36:20 can you use coconut oil to help chapped paw beans on cats?
6491 2018-02-25 16:36:10 @Fred_Cathy_Ret I hear you about Blue State blues!!! Check this out!!!

6505 2018-02-25 16:34:32 Idk about the grape jam and apple cider ones, but the blue jet fuel came from the sodor airport vehicles pack with Harold and a search light truck and the oil one is a knock off of the one that came with the pull n zoom diesel, hope that helps :)

6507 2018-02-25 16:34:12 #TheResistance is run by Clinton war hawks who have indirectly benefitted the @NRA’s stand on free flowing military weapons by supporting wars for oil even at the cost of human lives. They are what we’re resisting!

6516 2018-02-25 16:31:51 Some of them think new oil is being created all the time, from processes deep in the earth. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Lysenko had his time as well.

6573 2018-02-25 16:24:35 Just crude oil from what I've read. Which is why the huge decrease in prices (how did that happen? What caused OPEC to let prices collapse?) following VVP's invasion of Crimea was so crippling to him and why he needed those sanctions lifted. #Rosneft sale sure seems shady AF.
6574 2018-02-25 16:24:25 Ok. Fair enough. That works for someone living in a city where all the food is trucked in with semis with diesel motors, a product of oil by the way. Come to rural Alberta for a week and tell me how many charging stations there are. We have one in my hometown.

6678 2018-02-25 16:10:31 9 billion dollars 'Yes billion .. The village is true' is the size of looted money from oil revenues in Sudan.
According to the Transparency International report issued on February 22.  #Crisis_of_governance_in_Sudan
6679 2018-02-25 16:10:22 Do you use oil products? Are you willing to pay a substantially higher price to not use oil products? Are you and your so called “country” ahem sorry, province, willing to stop stealing $10 billion a year from Alberta?
6680 2018-02-25 16:10:21 Protests stop oil pipelines over potential leaks. These pipes dump directly into the water.  Sewage isn't as sexy as oil though.
6681 2018-02-25 16:10:20 The oil industry is now teetering financially across the board.  Cash-struggling Citgo is headed down and they are all struggling.  The market is glutted causing minimal incoming revenues.  Their corp. structures require mega revenues to survive.  He steps in to help them
6682 2018-02-25 16:10:17 @donsolives Hi Don, fortunately found you during my net search. I market Table Olives & Olive oil and am neck deep in love with Olives, always looking to enrich my knowledge about this noble fruit. Hope to benefit from your teachings. Be blessed.

6684 2018-02-25 16:10:12 I meant to get an oil change like Friday lol oops
6685 2018-02-25 16:10:12 He was saying the 'Socialist path" would have been Norway's: Govt controlling and investing oil revenues FOR THE PEOPLE, now reaping the rewards with national dividends.

6689 2018-02-25 16:09:58 Nash fetched the Rangers a little more than I thought he would but in all honesty, don't think the Bruins overpaid...especially since they were able to dump Belesky & part of his salary in the process.

6693 2018-02-24 23:59:43 หัวร้อน
6694 2018-02-24 23:59:39 Exactly!! A little moisturizing works wonders. I've been using Oil of Olay night moisturizing cream w.spf 20 yrs now. Don't have wrinkles & the sagging neck. Yet.
6695 2018-02-24 23:59:38 Will you be selling snake oil to cure my endless list of problems at that time as well?
6696 2018-02-24 23:59:33 OK I am very much not into homeopathic medicine, but I found that oil of oregano worked great to help with congestion. YMMV though!
6697 2018-02-24 23:59:22 Yes, and a little hoisin and a little soya - aside from that it is rice, veggies and sesame and peanut oil.
6698 2018-02-24 23:58:55 At least these guidelines for daycare get rid of most of the junk foods that were previously part of the staple fare. Maybe you could get them to compromise and use a butter/oil mixes available (they blend oil, not margarine). Or avocado. Or hummus.

Met Russian Gov’t during campaign
Met Russian oil co from Dossier-Dec

6733 2018-02-24 23:56:36 I think we relatively rich citizens in this very rich province which is due in large part to the luck of being born on top of oil/gas riches have therefore a higher duty or obligation to future generations to quickly transition off fossil fuels.
6734 2018-02-24 23:56:24 How will you cook noodles & add Palm oil ?

6737 2018-02-24 23:55:53 I WISH THAT WAS THE PROBLEM. I kind of blame the oil tank and maybe our space heaters or washer and dryer? Actually wild.

6745 2018-02-24 23:54:46 You all know that this debate would be entirely different if we got at the root of many problems facing this nation and reasonable discussions regarding policy and national interests rather than competing private interests; oil, pharma, pesticides, guns...End Citizens United.

6762 2018-02-24 23:51:57 i have it on good authority that the oil "gets the glitter everywhere".  a friend said she was still cleaning it out from around her clit a week later.

6766 2018-02-24 23:51:06 It's hard to look through the fog of propaganda on both sides at causes, but IMO while the sanctions and oil prices did not help, it's the collapse of oil production and exports following the nationalization of the industry, coupled with lots of money spending at root.

You should be surveilled by the US govt because I heard you got offered 1/5 of an oil company on a Tuesday.

How you feel about that knowing it gets zero degrees more plausible when it's Page instead of you?
6770 2018-02-24 23:49:48 yeah a straight turmeric latte is ok. I’m mixing mine into a bulletproof coffee - coffee, with a little coconut oil and coconut cream
6771 2018-02-24 23:49:46 I have some coconut oil and that’s just how it works, it gets liquid when it’s warmed up

6777 2018-02-24 23:48:51 Same polling that had Hillary winning by a landslide??? Dream, dream, dream!! PS: I heard there going to start drilling for oil of the California coast!
6778 2018-02-24 23:48:30 Small price to pay for North Sea oil revenue :D
6779 2018-02-24 23:48:15 A spill or an accident still can happen, especially if there is more tanker traffic off the coast. Canada is not prepared for a an oil spill like #ExxonValdez off the coast. It would be a mistake to allow the #KinderMorgan pipeline. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #AlbertaWhine

6783 2018-02-24 23:47:52 This is wrong on so many levels.

First, fox isn't news, and their opinion does not matter.

Second and more important, YOU are the president and you REFUSE to do a anything about Russia.
The Russia that's giving oil to North Korea, and meddling in our lives.
6784 2018-02-24 23:47:44 I guarantee that the "toasted pine kernels" in every Italian dish you have every eaten were 'toasted' in a pan. So yes, technically fried, because nuts are rich in oil so although the pan is dry, heat is conducted via oil.
6785 2018-02-24 23:47:31 Gravity has never been proven & can easily be explained by density & bouyancy. Climate change was nothing but a scam to jack up oil prices.

6787 2018-02-24 23:47:04 The hypocrisy of the US criticizing Russia over Syria bombing is astronomical. We've killed thousands of people in that region just for oil, and other economic interests.
6788 2018-02-24 23:46:51 The final qualifying session is on hold as NHRA's #SafetySafari is in the final stage of a pretty large oil down. Pro Stock will be up first, then Top Fuel, then Funny Car. Stay tuned. #NHRA #ArizonaNats
6789 2018-02-24 23:46:49 Well.. Rather than redeeming it for oil, the government will redeem it for the VALUE of a barrel of oil, according to official exchange rates, paid in their other (hyperinflating) currency. This is literally a ponzi extension.

6814 2018-02-24 23:43:03 Agree with Ed that higher interest rates = big negative for E&Ps that rely on OPM. Known Gail for yrs--her logic always confusing. I believe oil/energy cost is primary & interest rates secondary. Rising oil prices 2006-08 led to inflation/higher int rts that caused loan defaults.

6820 2018-02-24 23:42:25 Sure pal. Paddock could create 500 casualties in just 10 minutes with a shovel. Unlike AR-15s, trucks, fertilizer and fuel oil are very useful for more than the rapid slaughter of other humans beings.

6833 2018-02-24 23:40:59 23:20 on 24/2. Just been listening to some of the 'latest contemporary music' on Radio 3. It sounded like a load of machinery that someone had forgotten to oil - grinding away metallically and incessantly . The punishing background music of hell.

6848 2018-02-24 23:38:47 I totally agree there is utility here in skirting economic sanctions, but that utility would be better served if potential users of the petro felt like in a worst case scenario at least they'd wind up with oil, rather than hyperinflating/ed currency.

6860 2018-02-24 23:36:29 The difference is that Venezuela is, at least in theory, an oil producing nation with a nationalized extraction infrastructure.  There's no reason they can't redeem petros for oil, by the container or tankerload.  Except that then they'd have to give something valuable, like oil.

6865 2018-02-24 23:35:20 The venezuelan government will regulate the price.  The company that might trade $10,000 petros for its amount in barrels of oil is bankrupted (pdvsa).

6963 2018-02-24 23:16:40 Chef Louis cut up some carrots, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was some live hornets, along with grass.

6965 2018-02-24 23:16:31 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
6966 2018-02-24 23:16:26 You are seriously wrong on this one. Egypt doesn’t have much oil and has a massive population. The US gains 0. Their problems actually stem from a socialist system implemented in the era of Nasser which is entrenched and allows for a kleptocracratic regime to stay in power

6970 2018-02-24 23:16:00 Keep in mind, Page supposedly cut a deal with Rosneft (Russian oil company) that gave trump and officials a cut of 19% sell of the company in order to lift sanctions. 

Russia sold 19.5% of Rosneft to Qatar in Dec 2016.

6975 2018-02-24 23:15:33 TBF - Scotland leaves the Union & takes her whisky & gin, farmed meat & fish, textiles & manufacturing, tourism & finance, technology & oil - that doesn't really leave England a whole lot to offer up for trade.

6979 2018-02-24 23:14:31 USA soldiers fight for the Rich so the rich can get richer and take oil and resources. Wake up soldiers you are being used by a corrupt government. They will not pay in the end. Everyday we have to fight the GOP for disability benefits. Trump slashed Tricare.

6987 2018-02-24 23:13:23 Dude, they set the value of oil in their currency and it's completely disconnected from the world market and even the standard purchasing power of their currency.
That literally means your money is worth whatever they say it is when you try to redeem it.
6988 2018-02-24 23:13:20 Probably build an oil pipeline over native land...
6989 2018-02-24 23:13:14 Trouble is tho he is protected by the queen and was given exemption from prosecution because he was following her instructions in Iraq  weapons of destruction was just an excuse to gain back control ov her oil fields and gold that sadam Hussain had control over...

6991 2018-02-24 23:13:02 In regards to Oil, though: Do Not use Mineral/Semi-Synthetic Oil(s) in Direct Fuel Injection Engines, as the oils cause more carbon buildup/oil sludge in engine & it becomes more costly to fix, than engine running Fully-Synthetic Oil.

7017 2018-02-24 23:07:54 As soon as they divided the Middle East after the first WW they immediately started drilling  they already had prior knowledge of vast oil reserves there. British companies have a majority stake with the Saudis.

Stir in some goat cheese to finish. Roast some tomatoes with olive oil and sea salt. Sauté some beet greens. Reduce bag juice for sauce.

7049 2018-02-24 23:03:05 Sorry, but this CNN article is wrong regarding oil.  It had been state owned prior to Chavez.  Chavez changed the contracts regarding % of profits the state vs (largely foreign) companies got.

7076 2018-02-24 22:59:02 It's already been a frustrating day and now I have to get my oil changed,,, what's something cheap and low-calorie I can do to cheer myself up afterward
7077 2018-02-24 22:58:52 Blaming the NRA for mass shootings is like blaming the Petroleum Manufacturers Ass, for spending billions of dollars on election campaigns to install psychopaths into Congress who'd let them mix oil production refuse byproducts with milk to sell as baby formula.

7083 2018-02-24 22:57:51 Pretty good, thanks for asking. Lol. I had some troubles with my car getting an oil change and it was busy at work today, but other than that, I'm good ^//^

7086 2018-02-24 22:57:35 I’m presuming you chose Victoria Station, for what it represents besides the generic references to Brunel’s Rocket. A generic train station that represented a transitional time where Britains public transportation changed in the 1950’s early 60’s from the age of steam to oil. -
7087 2018-02-24 22:57:33 exactly. i’m not gonna get it. paying $70 for an oil change alone is enough to not want one

7109 2018-02-24 22:53:23 So deep i see oil... 
7110 2018-02-24 22:53:01 Those regulations protected our Country for future generations. Your "clean" coal (wtf is that), offshore drilling - oil spills polluting the oceans, air quality control, drilling on wildlife preserves. You may not care but your children's children will
7111 2018-02-24 22:52:58 Welp, so far I've spent my tax return on front and back brakes, new motor mounts, front control arm bushings and an oil change. Got 200$ left. I'm thinking 100 on the grandkids and 100 on that new Kamandi omnibus.  Er...I mean my wife. Heh.
7112 2018-02-24 22:52:27 Interestingly the world seems some what silent in the atrocities & food shortage in oil rich Iran and with palates of from US #ObamaDistructionDeal
7113 2018-02-24 22:52:16 You'll need to slide out of your dress before you join me in that bath, and I feast my eyes upon your gorgeous body, which i cannot wait to massage with oil, when you see with me among the bubbles and hot water...my hands start on your back and neck
7114 2018-02-24 22:52:16 “Didn’t change the oil once” in your next car I’d advise to check it pal! 
7115 2018-02-24 22:52:03 I was just worried it would make it taste too ‘Italian’- wanted a milder oil. I went for groundnut. Whatever that is!
7116 2018-02-24 22:51:35 Buttermilk pancakes! Mix dry: 2 c flour; 2 tbsp sugar; 2 tsp baking powder; 2 tsp baking soda; 1 tsp salt. Blend then add to dry: 2 eggs; 2 c buttermilk; 1/4 c vegetable oil. Feeds ~4. Can sub 3 parts milk to 1 part yogurt or sour cream for buttermilk.

i have a pretty old Peugeot 206. only had it about 2 months and know nothing about cars, so if anyone can help please do. When i turn the ignition on my warning light for my oil comes on, but then goes when i actually start the engine. is this normal or …
7121 2018-02-24 22:51:12 Interesting argument, as it depends upon where the biomass is sourced 
, but it makes a valid argument when considering what evolutions in transport had been happening at the time in 1958. More oil transitions from coal, but a few years earlier, it could have been achievable.
7122 2018-02-24 22:51:10 Palm oil. I never drink this .

7125 2018-02-24 22:50:43 If there's one thing I'm proud of, it's the ability to remove my makeup with a wipe and coconut oil, cleanse, tone and moisturize after the dunda. I also drink water afterwards.
7126 2018-02-24 22:50:32 Tried #costco’s Hazulnet Spread (#nutella substitute). Not only is it delicious, it contains no palm oil (which Nutella is unfortunately full of). Love it!

7134 2018-02-24 22:48:50 A case which contained all  the ingredients of a massive political scandal in Texas ended this week. Oil money, get-rich-quick Ponzi scheme,& one incredibly greedy Dem lawmaker were at center of a criminal enterprise that persisted long right underneath noses of Texas voters
7135 2018-02-24 22:48:48 Obviously I’m not the one misinformed. Besides, unions spend 8 times what the NRA does, that doesn’t include all the other lobbyist, oil, pharma, etc.

7141 2018-02-24 22:47:58 Very disappointed in Russia. It is increasingly clear that RF keeps stopping short of securing victory. Just as when RF gave up the oil and gas fields last August, they are wimping out at a critical moment. 

My guess is that US will do another cruise missile strike if SAA moves.
7142 2018-02-24 22:47:48 Went to pick up my car from an oil change and the window was open. SO GUESS WHO HAS SNOW IN THEIR CAR LOLOL
7143 2018-02-24 22:47:46 Maybe they are getting low on gas & oil and have put in Plan B. Oil & gas is not going to last forever!
7144 2018-02-24 22:46:46 I’m so excited to put oil on my hair tomorrow and feel reborn

7158 2018-02-24 22:43:52 Interesting that many young people supported @SenSanders because they were tired of the big money Democrats controlling  the party and their support of foriegn wars and the war industry.  These wars were about oil. Millenials were excluded from Party decision making.

7168 2018-02-24 22:42:11 It's right to use cannabis organic or kosher for medicine even in full spectrum oil. It's ok even an apirin is more damaging than thc oil.

7172 2018-02-24 22:40:48 BTW, the $25 million fine that had in 2001 for stealing oil was due to David’s twin, Bill Koch uncovering that malfeasance all to help force a lawsuit settlement that had been raging for years.

7183 2018-02-24 22:39:22 Wow. RIGHT after I tweeted about "lit" I pretty much set my kitchen on fire. I spaced some key knowledge to cooking with oil. hOLY shit. I guess you could say the whole experience was pretty "lit"
7184 2018-02-24 22:39:16 BITCH th erbiggest mood is how i put coconut oil on my lash line at night then im seein blurry so i wipe it till its gone/. why do i do this

7189 2018-02-24 22:38:38 To combine an oil/grease with water in such a fashion such that it will mix and suspend~

When product is too strong you mix it in your hands while gently rinsing/spritzing water so it has a more natural look and hold in your hair. :3

7191 2018-02-24 22:38:25 We have type 1 and type 2,type usually idiopathic while type 2:obesity,diet and family history.
7192 2018-02-24 22:38:22 Which oil do U use
7193 2018-02-24 22:38:03 It does not matter if the oil reserves are real or not.
PDVSA will not sell a single barrel of oil if you are to pay them with Petros.
This means only one thing: Venezuela does not trust its own crypto-currency. If it does not, why should we?
7194 2018-02-24 22:37:58 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
7195 2018-02-24 22:37:49 Oil. Steele. Internet. Telephone etc. all have a price fixed monopoly. They also have a monopoly over the pipeline resulting in "new companies" that could do it cheaper not being able to go into the market. Which is kinda my point.
7196 2018-02-24 22:37:41 With Big Oil leaving the State, their tax dollars go with them How is that a win? Plains Pipeline has been shut down in our county, along with offshore oil; families are leaving our county, defaulting on  mortgages & car pymts, public schools want to SUE Big Oil for lost revenue.

7202 2018-02-24 22:36:56 why does Jamie Oliver put olive oil on everything?????
7203 2018-02-24 22:36:55 OPEC deals come and go. They no longer determine the oil price in the way they once did. I think the Kremlin is filled with obsessive fools. $60 oil delays the inevitable, nothing more.

7207 2018-02-24 22:36:17 Indeed. Maybe we should investigate the reporting systems and consider updating them and deploying better training on their use. Perhaps we could even run an audit to see if there are other people who haven't been entered into the system.

7211 2018-02-24 22:35:36 2) share does so by offering a better product for cheaper. ALL so called free market ‘monopolies’ from oil to aluminum, to steel, to shipping to rail roads (the CP and UP were gov monopolies and don’t count) drove DOWN the prices of their commodities. EVERY TIME.
7212 2018-02-24 22:35:33 My Instant Pot works decently well as a rice cooker, 1 1/3 C H2O per cup of rice, 6 min at HP, sit for 15, then vent and enjoy. I add a lite salt (1 t) and some olive oil, maybe some bay leaves depending on the recipe.
7213 2018-02-24 22:35:31 Keep some good fats in your diet. Almonds, walnuts, olive oil, and avocado.
7214 2018-02-24 22:35:30 Olive oil (or whatever cooking oil you have around) should take off most of it! I've made the same mistake. :-)
7215 2018-02-24 22:35:22 What do you propose to do when the oil is gone? Do you know of something else we can dig up and burn?

The militias in Iraq ended up boosting the shadow economy (esp in Oil services) and localised abuse of power..
Eventually led to the emergence of localised support for ISIS.. not based on ideology but based on anti-corruption/lawlessness drive..

7247 2018-02-24 22:30:22 All I want is a day with my dad sitting in the shop working on my bike. Putting new graphics on, softening my suspension, changing the oil all that good stuff.

7249 2018-02-24 22:30:03 BBC releases a documentary called &quot;White Fright: Divided Britain&quot;Shows how Muslim immigration/integration is an orange Cheeto clown who is literally the epitome of snake oil salesman.

7254 2018-02-24 22:29:07 @BetsyZRussell you actually are in favor of CBD oil???? You need to be fired or jailed. This is Idaho NOT California, idiot
7255 2018-02-24 22:29:01 Is rose hip oil good for clearing up acne scars and hyper pigmentation?
7256 2018-02-24 22:28:55 On that date, there will be a restrictive acclamation in Russia, not an election. And the oil price would be-and will remain over long term-at the price point that makes marginal shale production commercially viable. (At or around $60 subject to short term supply constraints).
7257 2018-02-24 22:28:48 If the FBI, CIA, NSA, big pharma, big oil, big tobacco, big agra & big insurance are all spying on you, trying to kill you & trying to rob you; what do you think the NRA is doing? 
7258 2018-02-24 22:28:27 Some people never learn!
7259 2018-02-24 22:28:27 Chris there is much each of us can do, if we will read and research. 3great books that have benefited me, Brain Maker about our gutbugs, Undoctored covers lots, The Big Fat Surprise a good food&oil history
7260 2018-02-24 22:28:20 Does advertising work or is it just a lucrative snake oil con by Madison Avenue?

7262 2018-02-24 22:27:59 The dedication I have with my routines is ... I could sleep now but I’m staying up an extra 2 hours so the cocunut oil dissolves on my face and then I’m able to sleep  #BeautyHurts
7263 2018-02-24 22:27:58 No1 cares abt #Syria coz of no oil.. pls find some oil there and the world will suddenly be willing to save it #SyriaCrisis #GhoutaGenocide #DeathOfHumanity #SaveGhouta #cleanseSyria
7264 2018-02-24 22:27:53 I don't get why they have to "hate". I'm not into cutesy concepts but it just means that I won't listen to cutesy songs just like I don't with all the shirt-ripping-I-am-so-manly-and-I-like-putting-oil-on-my-chest boy groups concept. Fangirls can be so petty
7265 2018-02-24 22:27:40 If you worked as an electrical engineer, you obviously have a feel for math. Have you seen the data re CO2? You also know the difference between an exponential and linear rate of growth.
Oil is far from done, yes. There's every reason to invest in renewables.
7266 2018-02-24 22:27:24 Baby oil is essential to bubble baths

7272 2018-02-24 22:26:08 Considering the price of oil and the corporate rate cut they just got, this is one break they probably don’t need. And since when does Atlanta need to fight for more air traffic?
7273 2018-02-24 22:26:02 How does he win this trade? Davidson bonafide NHL D man, 3rd round pick with 10 percent chance ever contributing to oil. 
Chia won by making the claim, and blew it again imo
7274 2018-02-24 22:26:02 Water can wash off dirt by itself. Shampoo's role is to be an emulsifying agent and surround oil so that it no longer sticks. Water flushes that combination. Idk what happens with dry shampoo, but I imagine it falls off, or water later on washes it?
7275 2018-02-24 22:25:39 Or use truffle oil.
7276 2018-02-24 22:25:28 Getting the long over due oil change done right now

7284 2018-02-24 22:23:55 45’s inheritance and fortune has never been a problem for them (even as he sold snake oil), so why poke at Lebron for the money he *earned and worked hard for. Rhetorical question...

7287 2018-02-24 22:23:05 My former life as a junior oil exec make me very suspicious of arguments that use oil to explain politics. Shale, in this respect, is devisive. Saudi production strategy entirely explained by it.
7288 2018-02-24 22:22:55 Found out about the oil pipes yet? They were installed to allow Studland Bay to be flooded with oil that would have been ignited in the event of an attack.

7293 2018-02-24 22:21:57 Absolutely I'm as Scottish as the Glenns and the Oil Rigs!!!
7294 2018-02-24 22:21:52 He is wrong. The AR-15 is not used by any organized military on earth, as far as I know.
7295 2018-02-24 22:21:43 there’s cbd oil in my coffee 
7296 2018-02-24 22:21:40 My Dad was in the oil business. Crude oil is rotted fossils. It is toxic, it pollutes our Planet and must be stopped. Toxic crude oil set the stage for my Dad dying with cancer.
Clean, renewable energy is our future. Please stop promoting oil now.
7297 2018-02-24 22:21:32 It is true the US has the most oil. But it's also true most teck is not allowed go into production. You can find 100 year-old light bulbs still in use. The company went out of business :) teck exists, but only for the military and the bankers who prophet from old fuel teck.
7298 2018-02-24 22:21:20 Thanks for the channel 4 program on Studland and the Isle of Purbeck. Would have been better speaking to locals rather than relying upon Gustav! What about the oil pipes that were in place to fill the bay with oil to be ignited in the event of an attack @ToriHerridge

7312 2018-02-24 22:19:46 No individual deserves to own an oil block in this country. It should be shared according between all the states . Lives of masses is more important than an individual .
7313 2018-02-24 22:19:31 Both The Cloverfield Paradox and Ready Player One are based on the idea that society will collapse when we run out of fossil fuels.  Truth is there’s enough oil reserves already pumped to destroy our society through climate change.  We’re imagining the wrong Apocalypse.

7322 2018-02-24 22:17:13 Please let me know how it comes out. You're welcome 
One thing, if you're not a pepper fan, reduce the amount of rodo to tatashe ratio. Because the lack of oil will make the pepper more intense

7328 2018-02-24 22:16:11 Pamela's definition of monopoly is on the right track. Can't say the same for you. By your logic, if Halliburton and Schlumberger decide to merge together, it's not a monopoly because they don't own oil.
7329 2018-02-24 22:16:11 "Our news media" - Need to stop saying that, it's MSM liberal media.

7339 2018-02-24 22:15:19 Here's another one: Diesel invented his engine so that farmers could grow oilseeds and produce their own fuel, but oil companies buried that idea 130+ years ago... The oil companies are not friends to social ideals and neither are you.
7340 2018-02-24 22:15:12 I use one of my empty @BonneMamanUS jelly jars. Pour in a bit of olive oil, add crushed garlic, squeeze of fresh lemon juice, some @thegreypoupon country Dijon mustard, bit of pepper & shake til mixed. I don’t really measure at all, mainly go by taste

7375 2018-02-24 22:11:58 I didn't use oil at all. After parboiling the pepper, i added iru, seasoning and the fish for it to cook together.
Once the fish was done, i took it out and poured in the vegetable.
Allowed it to cook on low heat for about 3 minutes. Added the fish back and cooked for 2 minutes
7376 2018-02-24 22:11:50 We have no "windmills", this is deliberate obfuscation. Windmills grind grain, wind turbines produce power, power that is renewable and pretty cheap... But, your oil company masters can't compete with that, so you resort to cheap denigration...

7397 2018-02-24 22:08:49 how would you recommend doing it? was considering doing a top wash of drakenhoff night shade and nuln oil on the legs
7398 2018-02-24 22:08:44 Speculating again on LSE, Surely just wait for the RNS. People get very 'p' off if  it goes wrong..#ukog
7399 2018-02-24 22:08:39 She should kuku start ororo business with the oil from her face...Maigerrd!
7400 2018-02-24 22:08:34 Yes I love bread and olive oil too and I'll take plenty snacks so I don't go hungry 
7401 2018-02-24 22:08:23 Using coconut oil to shave >
7402 2018-02-24 22:08:22 A mam wear cloth full of oil doesn't dance near fire .
7403 2018-02-24 22:08:20 The West Coast fishery will be done in just one oil spill.
7404 2018-02-24 22:08:15 Yes I jus forgot to add the oil after coconut lmao
7405 2018-02-24 22:08:11 It’s Your sweet oil pouring over me like the rain, pouring over me. 
7406 2018-02-24 22:08:04 It's a good idea to start thinking about building South Louisiana cities out of oil platforms since that's all that will be here eventually anyway
7407 2018-02-24 22:08:01 Super productive day today...4 oil paintings underway, lots more to do on them but feeling so chuffed I’ve got them all started! X

7410 2018-02-24 22:07:55 skincare advice: don’t use coconut oil on your face. it clogs up your pores. (i’m talking from personal experience too).
7411 2018-02-24 22:07:51 A dermatologist will help out so much! Also using products that are OIL FREE  will make such a difference. I hope everything gets better
7412 2018-02-24 22:07:50 It’s nice and light on my hair. Argon oil is great but i have to use it by itself.
7413 2018-02-24 22:07:50 "We must do better"

What that suppose to mean? 

The only better you can do is stop the war. 

West and East are friends, guns oil atc. BUSSINES  is good humanity is much BETTER

7418 2018-02-24 22:07:44 You forget to mention that PMB inherited an economy that's heading to recession after crude oil fall which was the major reason behind such borrowing.
7419 2018-02-24 22:07:39 Ok so I just used lavender oil (w/ jojoba oil as the carrier oil) on my stomach because it’s been hurting and it immediately relaxed my muscles. I wasn’t expecting much but I’m pleasantly surprised. 
7420 2018-02-24 22:07:36 There won’t be any riches under the sea left if we have even one dilbit oil spills. Tell Trudeau our oceans, our shores and our indigenous people are worth a lot more than his $10B in tax said he hopes to collect from Alberta.

7427 2018-02-24 22:06:56 Also how do you like that grapeseed oil?
7428 2018-02-24 22:06:52 Like coconut oil??
7429 2018-02-24 22:06:34 Or many other foods. One I've eaten since childhood is a simple salad, finely chopped cabbage, heaps of chopped coriander, olive oil and lemon dressing
7430 2018-02-24 22:06:27 Oil that you use everyday.

7436 2018-02-24 22:05:03 And if your country does not need oil, and other countries don't, Russia is not going to produce oil that nobody buys. I am surprised that you need it to be explained to you.
7437 2018-02-24 22:05:01 Tweeting out his thought process on this stuff is gold. If he’d stuck to purely gun arguments it might’ve been harder to write off as textbook leftist activism, but this recent stuff & a scroll down his pre-Feb stuff pretty much cements it.
7438 2018-02-24 22:05:00 Sweet kids I'm very empathetic too but they are going to have their difficulties when confronted with reality and facts they aren't accustomed too.
7439 2018-02-24 22:04:58 Keep digging, I'm sure he has oil stock too
7440 2018-02-24 22:04:58 Get the softest skin ever by smoothing on baby oil in the shower after washing or add a few drops of baby oil in your body wash and shake!
7441 2018-02-24 22:04:31 They always have bread, olive oil and tomatoes. So yummy!! You should take some food with you like cheese and biscuits to get you started 
7442 2018-02-24 22:04:10 Everything will be sweetness and light! African countries all have high standards when dealing with it citizens! For example Nigeria's oil wealth is fairly distributed among it citizens. - I don't think so. 

It's not the EU's custom union that keeps Africa poor.

7446 2018-02-24 22:03:37 What authority do you have in economics or you sucking thumb for your opinion? Shut and learn if you have no idea of what you commenting on. Be humble. It is free education. Now imagine what a strong rand does when we buy oil.
7447 2018-02-24 22:03:37 If you can afford it, Olaplex is supposedly the best. Im broke af so I just use the Ion Keratin shampoo/conditioner from Sallys. I typically towel dry my hair, spray Bodyshop argon oil onto a Wet brush, brush out any tangles and let my hair air dry. My hair is now past my boobs.
7448 2018-02-24 22:03:05 Oh, FFS. @eBay sellers may ship however the hell they want to.  I'm beginning to think he might have bullied Cruz.  Our young Hogg certainly perfected the technique.

7452 2018-02-24 22:02:23 You’re talking about something else.

In 1890, Standard Oil of Ohio controlled about 88% of the oil market. That was when Ohio tried to put regulations on it.

In 1899 they moved out of Ohio and formed the Standard Oil Trust and Standard Oil of New Jersey.
7453 2018-02-24 22:02:17 You know when you got the Oil heating up on the frying pan for a minute then you throw that first piece in ..... don’t be that first piece in the frying pan ... because if you try to cut ass on me I grew up with hood Niggas I would fry that ass.... Facts 
7454 2018-02-24 22:02:02 Guess this guy hasn't heard of the Husky spill in the North Saskatchewan river a couple years ago. Or the dilbit in the Kalamazoo River oil spill. Or the dozens of other ones!
7455 2018-02-24 22:01:54 
You're adorable. 

Do you recall the Oil Kings first big run to the Memorial Cup? When Brossoit was their goalie?
They were always matched up against the Portland Winterhawks in the WHL finals and their superstar players were Ty Rattie and Sven Baertschi (Canucks).
7456 2018-02-24 22:01:54 And doesn't know that USPS contracts Fed Ex to do a lot of their cross country transport.

7459 2018-02-24 22:01:24 Give me oil blocks and I'll become a motivational speaker by June.
7460 2018-02-24 22:01:08 Now is the time for all of us, as one country, Democrat, yet don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
7461 2018-02-24 22:01:05 I suspect the discovery of AB/SK oil sands had something to do with it. It's a huge economy in both.
7462 2018-02-24 22:01:03 Weather manipulation is another issue for another book. They are related though. Someone said, "The US is an oil company with an army." The simplest expression of the truth. So renewable climate change solutions are not very welcome in its media.

7465 2018-02-24 22:00:51 Well.

This could be ok for the current problems, but his idea about keep building oil refineries as a solution for the energetic crisis is old and un viable.

Watch his explanation of how the oil problem has to be solved.
Childish, basic and clearly from inopia.

Why English?

7475 2018-02-24 21:59:26 That's the power of big oil. I wonder if this is what @BarackObama meant by "let see how it plays out"
7476 2018-02-24 21:59:16 Why would you buy a gloss if you can put on coconut oil which is as shinny but without annoying glitter particles, moisturizing and half as sticky seriously coconut oil is the answer to everything
7477 2018-02-24 21:58:55 actually the states need to be able to regulate and handle a lot of the crap that trump is so famous for screwing up. off shore drilling, home rule, oil and gas regulations, trade.
7478 2018-02-24 21:58:48 Coconut oil hair masks saved my hair from dying in this dry, cold weather 
7479 2018-02-24 21:58:30 Still suffering 2 years later
7480 2018-02-24 21:58:02 Try Evening Primrose Oil or Star Flower Oil. They are gel capsules and can be found almost anywhere. Dischem has more brands. They help with PMS as well. I have found one capsule a day helps to reduce discomfort significantly

Complain to complain.
7483 2018-02-24 21:57:35 motor oil? i call it carbeque sauce.
7484 2018-02-24 21:57:24 The trick is a pinch of powdered minti the lemon curd well that and using a combination of butter and olive oil as the base.
7485 2018-02-24 21:57:24 Cleaning today. I like to put some lemon and citronella oil on my Swiffer when I clean the floors to cut and clear bad energy. Smells marvelous!

7490 2018-02-24 21:56:37 jojoba oil is actually really bomb once you learn how to properly pronounce it
7491 2018-02-24 21:56:37 However, unless plant production is banned in general, actually water usage won’t change either. Itll just be re directed to producing other crops for other purposes, such as ethanol, oil, human consumption, or making other materials.
7492 2018-02-24 21:56:30 Turns out I might be someone kratom doesn't work for.

Luckily, I have CBD oil to help me through this horrible, headache-y time.
7493 2018-02-24 21:56:24 As I said earlier, no problem  whatsoever w/ the return.
7494 2018-02-24 21:56:16 Nope. You said the davidson trade was because the team is handcuffed by bad contracts. Not even close. Davidson is a dime a dozen player. They moved him because they got great value for him. Nothing to do with cap. Period. So you bringing that up was pointless.
7495 2018-02-24 21:56:06 Honestly need a face I truly connect with
7496 2018-02-24 21:56:06 Exactly.  And with the gaping holes in D, we really coulda used him.  How do you spell Jeff Petrie? 
7497 2018-02-24 21:55:45 I missed that. Who was the idiot who said that?
7498 2018-02-24 21:55:36 I'm really sorry oil
7499 2018-02-24 21:55:31 I would be inclined to support the Green Party, but not if you are going to blindly support imperialistic oil wars & Islamic extremists

7501 2018-02-24 21:55:18 Well that's unfortunate for that coin, because that regime owes to much money to other countries and he is paying it off with oil. So, how is he going to back the coin with oil they don't own? I would not invest in anything Maduro puts out into crypto.

7511 2018-02-24 21:53:04 Prices of commodities go up and down through the year or from year to year. As these are now traded globally. This is not just dairy but all types of food products. Even non food like oil. Butter is currently on a £ high.

7513 2018-02-24 21:52:40 Oil studies diary: not that bad - getting back on track. 
7514 2018-02-24 21:52:37 Surely only a matter of time before foods high in sugar and fat come with similar shocking imagery as cigarette packs, considering what they do to our arteries. It's all just plumbing, after all. We wouldn't pour oil and fat down the sink cos we know it'll block the pipes, so...
7515 2018-02-24 21:52:19 LOL. And I know who you're talking about.
7516 2018-02-24 21:52:18 ありがとう
7517 2018-02-24 21:52:08 Last time I checked you were the one who said Davidson's contract has nothing to do w/ the forwards. The team's cap number is what it is, hence why all the contracts are tied together. Pretty straightforward.
7518 2018-02-24 21:52:05 Runaway as fast as you can
7519 2018-02-24 21:52:04 Looking to short #oil against the strongest currencies this week
7520 2018-02-24 21:51:59 The crude is diluted with light oil or condensate. No chemicals are required to get them to blend. This is the same light products that are shipped around the world. The toxins in sewage may contain steroids, harmful cleaners, pharmaceuticals and highly infectious diseases = safe

7532 2018-02-24 21:48:40 He's a 3rd pairing defenceman & to argue anything different is silly. Have never had an issue w/ him but this team can I'll afford to have guy making that $ in said spot. Especially when the organization knew what was in their immediate cap future.
7533 2018-02-24 21:48:36 Okay..  Not sure if you mentioned it, but now the Oil are at 47 contracts right?  You skid Letestu and Cammalari for picks.. you're down to 45.  Even if Maroon gets 1 "prospect" (which I've heard but I doubt will happen) back, you're at 46. Something bigger coming to save PC's jb
7534 2018-02-24 21:48:35 hey @retronauts  Thanks for the ads telling me about olive oil and coffee filters. My car looks like it's been armoralled with stuff I had anyway. It was a serious clutch for my date.

7537 2018-02-24 21:48:20 Great tip for freshening up bed sheets. Yes, just what you wanted :))  About 1 tablespoon of bicarb soda in usual dispenser. Into fabric softener dispenser, add same amount of white vinegar - & put in teaspoon of eucalyptus oil.  Gorgeous fresh sheets! #greenliving
7538 2018-02-24 21:47:57 I thought ebay was private individuals selling stuff.  Doesn't each seller choose the method of delivery?
7539 2018-02-24 21:47:40 All these billionaires with their stories that touch “motivational” speeches. Majority of them achieved that status jankara way and did not work from the ground up. When you are rich, the money becomes the motivational speaker crook or legit! Our oil baroness we hail!

7547 2018-02-24 21:46:44 I always love how the dealer will charge more for an oil filter that has the car emblem slapped onto it.
7548 2018-02-24 21:46:40 Nope just lather oil-in-balm properly into your hair
7549 2018-02-24 21:46:36 It is unless they cleaned it up & the President declassified it.
7550 2018-02-24 21:46:30 Cough cough cough.  Wheezzzzzeeeee.    Yep!   No regulations is really working. No clean air. No clean water.  No more trees.  Just oil rigs and leaky pipelines. Great job you moron.

7557 2018-02-24 21:45:26 it's good to have excess oil in your skin after a certain age.  Fights off the wrinkles
7558 2018-02-24 21:45:05 Sebastian Gorka, another jackals whose 15 minutes of infamy should have been up several years ago. He's a fraud, at best, and a snake oil salesman.
7559 2018-02-24 21:44:52 Too many weiner heads in politics in Canada Even Obama in USA let LNG and oil prosper
7560 2018-02-24 21:44:40 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
7561 2018-02-24 21:44:40 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
7562 2018-02-24 21:44:32 It wasn’t bad at all,I only had pain going from 2g to 0g. Always oil your ears and pull on them often. That’ll help them adjust. Plus be patient
7563 2018-02-24 21:44:26 Good luck Jordan
7564 2018-02-24 21:44:22 Go get another top 10 finish!  
7565 2018-02-24 21:43:34 Dude, the US allowed ISIS to over run #Syria for 18 months until they were at the gates of Damascus. All so you could grab Syrian Oil. #Russia joined the conflict & ISIS began retreating within 3 months. This slaughter begins & ends with the US. You engineered it.Ask Wes Clarke.
7566 2018-02-24 21:43:28 A fish with his mouth closed doesnt get caught.

7569 2018-02-24 21:43:10 And you have fools, obsessed with wealth, according them with respect - like if someone dashed me a oil block and I won the oil lottery too I won’t be balling. It’s that simple, I’d do the same thing in her position - just stop the patronizing crap!
7570 2018-02-24 21:42:59 yeah, it’s just hemp oil.
7571 2018-02-24 21:42:48 Have they given you a start time?
7572 2018-02-24 21:42:48 Muhammad Atta did not die in any plane on date 9 of 2001.  He was later employed at Saudi Arabian airlines as a piolet.

7574 2018-02-24 21:42:34 That sounds good! I always use a drizzle of olive oil and red wine vinegar on my salads. But I'm not even close to being vegan.

7576 2018-02-24 21:42:17 If hes a RFA how could he be coming back to the oil ? They would havs to trade right ?

7580 2018-02-24 21:41:33 Sir its not just oil bloc, but whatever u are focused to accomplishing. Academics, career, a job, a trade, an adventure. Sir anything even President of Nigeria. Anything.
7581 2018-02-24 21:41:22 I was thinking about oil news too I can see them slavering noo

7586 2018-02-24 21:41:00 Let's be honest, it's mostly just because you're an extremist who can't win.  And you're much more effective as a snake oil salesmen while being a private citizen.
7587 2018-02-24 21:40:46 Don't worry...the bump up the lineup will come next week 
7588 2018-02-24 21:40:45 i use coconut oil on mines
7589 2018-02-24 21:40:36 Yea I agree. Enthusiasm gap has essentially closed IMO. American workers keeping more of our hard-earned money and attacks on our freedoms are a major “rallying cry”.

7596 2018-02-24 21:40:14 If you honestly think arming teachers is going to prevent school shootings, then I have a bottle of snake oil to sell you
7597 2018-02-24 21:39:49 It’s so annonying the patronizing way they insult our intelligence - you went from being Maryam Babangida’s tailor, with no knowledge of the oil industry, to owning a oil block - we are not fools. Enjoy yourself and carry go.
7598 2018-02-24 21:39:47 For soup, cook cubed leek in oil, then simmer with turkey, herbs de Provence, coconut milk and kale. Top with sour cream.
7599 2018-02-24 21:39:34 Two police have been Martyred at one of the Kirkuk oil fields as the result of an armed attack. 

Their names are Khalil Sallo and Jalal Abdullah. One other officer has been wounded.
7600 2018-02-24 21:39:20 Oh funny story. So I am buying my hair oil and stuff and my head wrap for my hair and this bitch wants to look me down and act like I shouldn't be in the African American hair section. Bitch take yo ass on.
7601 2018-02-24 21:39:01 Only way they get value on Benning is as a piece in a bigger deal, which isn't happening at the deadline. No comment on Auvitu, as his trade value is essentially nothing.
7602 2018-02-24 21:38:34 Hope una dey alright sha, or your brain still needs oil..?
7603 2018-02-24 21:38:26 There is magic in the air tonight, or maybe just peppermint oil and tranquillisers.
7604 2018-02-24 21:38:15 Yes. I just didn’t feel like making up a batch of dressing with olive oil, lemon juice, garlic & stone ground mustard; it’s so good.
7605 2018-02-24 21:38:10 Wax, wears better, or Danish oil
7606 2018-02-24 21:38:00 Ah I ate the hard cheddar. Shan't be eating any vegan cheese again though as it seems to be stuffed full of coconut oil
7607 2018-02-24 21:37:56 Russell deal is not a bad deal at all. What's bad about it? 

Leads ALL Oilers D in points. Shot blocks & skates well.

He makes $4M. Not a bad deal at all. Especially when he wanted $5.5M x5
7608 2018-02-24 21:37:55 if you’re not tryna pay $50 for an oil change take your ass to ABC!!! why would you bring your ass to a dealership and expect us to charge the same amount as a run down ass mechanics shop?? common sense, ma’am
7609 2018-02-24 21:37:31 Coconut oil is great and all until your dogs think your legs are desserts.
7610 2018-02-24 21:36:45 A few days ago I had the same thought. TRUMP was a Snake Oil Elixir Pusher. TRUMP's like a bad Drug Pusher who warps the minds of the weak minded. People have been taken in by these type of persons forever.
7611 2018-02-24 21:36:42 Baba you can determine all u like... If u are not close enough to powers that be, no oil blocs for u
7612 2018-02-24 21:36:42 A refreshing facial mask, earthy blue, with bearberry, olive oil, and exfoliating beach sand. It comes as a slippery powder.
7613 2018-02-24 21:36:39 Your Wcw deleted her tweet about receiving oil bloc in good faith.She is a billionaire and knew she was wrong with that tweet.

7615 2018-02-24 21:36:29 He probably is.
7616 2018-02-24 21:36:26 Can u have olive oil?
7617 2018-02-24 21:36:10 Wonder how many ground nesting birds benefit from palm oil plantations?
7618 2018-02-24 21:35:53 What are this boys qualifications to Represent the USA in Foreign Policy. Wonder what Rex thinks. Wouldn’t ever happen too a “gas and oil man”
7619 2018-02-24 21:35:49 Oil change was smooth & fast but the gas tank well that’s another story now 
7620 2018-02-24 21:35:49 I was ready to ride out a chill note this semester but alas. here I am. grinding hard. burnin that midnight oil. what the fuck is going on
7621 2018-02-24 21:35:38 So this weekend I learned not to moisturize my skin when I get out the shower then play with puppies. They smelled the coconut oil and wouldn’t stop biting my toes or ankles. Smh.
7622 2018-02-24 21:35:29 Depends what the expectations are. He's a solid third pairing guy.
7623 2018-02-24 21:35:26 The faith of a seamstress
That kinda faith
That unlocks vaults
Also unearths Oil Wells.
7624 2018-02-24 21:35:26 Hey @BettyCrocker the print on your Fudge Brownie Mix is so small we couldn't read it with a (dirty) magnifying glass. We had to google to find how much oil to add. Maybe wanna use a bigger font for that?
7625 2018-02-24 21:35:19 "Lider Oil di leader in flavor and now Lider Margarine di greatest to savor, c cooking, baking cakes and bread. Lider Margarine so easy to spread"

*Beats random zinc fence with all of my might* 
7626 2018-02-24 21:35:07 'sophistry and snake oil', and 'Romney was a fraud as Governor and a fraud as a Presidential candidate', okay, what about 'Romney’s actual fitness and soundness for office'? These days, the most popular governor in the country is a Republican from Mass. Is he another one?
7627 2018-02-24 21:35:06 Which of the following is the first Indian private company to sign an accord with Government of Myanmar for oil exploration in two offshore blocks in that country ?

7629 2018-02-24 21:35:02 @JessicaTarlov my wife would like to know what you have in your hair today? She loves it, she said it’s shiny, has volume and doesn’t look oily (like Moroccan Oil). It does look really nice!
7630 2018-02-24 21:34:48 Just did an oil change on a R32 
7631 2018-02-24 21:34:48 Do the fish oil too. Niacin and red yeast rice as well. Had a friend get off the bp meds with it so, giving it a try.
7632 2018-02-24 21:34:44 And we mind your being a maladjusted sociopath. But fortunately the general inconsequentiality of your existence doesn't give us much cause to regard you at all. Now, get back to spanking it while huffing  gun oil.
7633 2018-02-24 21:34:43 Bad belle is not unique to Alakija's wealth. The story of getting oil bloc by faith in Nigeria of those years... Really???
7634 2018-02-24 21:34:41 Actually it's all tied together. Also, the Russell signing prior to last yr was smart but the extension was idiotic. Nothing wrong w/ the Sekera deal. Handing out term as if It's candy is killer.
7635 2018-02-24 21:34:33 Y'all I am living. ever since i started using that amber rose hydrating shampoo and condition my hair looks so good and shiny and i like put primrose oil in it when it was wet and lordt
7636 2018-02-24 21:34:27 @nytopinion David Brody, a liar will say anything. You and all the Christian fundies have been sold a pig in a poke. You've been flim-flammed by a snake oil salesman. I've got a bridge in Brooklyn for sale. Great price. You're just going to love it. Believe me
7637 2018-02-24 21:34:17 Y'all talking about oil, it's the filter that counts!
7638 2018-02-24 21:33:00 sa diay nako nga puno kayg oil ang akung cellphone :(( nganong oily kay ang lechon sa lamesaaa :(
7639 2018-02-24 21:32:55 They put a smile on my face. These children are hope. Hope is a very powerful force. Go after all the Merchants of Death & Greed. Guns, Alcohol, Tobacco, Big Pharma, Big Oil, et al. Vote out those that accept money from them. Make it so they can never receive to begin with. #Hope
7640 2018-02-24 21:32:52 I’m sorta sitting over here going “¿Por que no los dos?”

Both seem like worthy causes to me, and it would be great to do research into minimizing the enabling need for oil across the board, and our space-based ambitions really need nuclear power.
7641 2018-02-24 21:32:52 “I’m always burnin that midnight oil”

7644 2018-02-24 21:32:20 Wonder why the Ranger mascot was chosen over an oil related one
7645 2018-02-24 21:32:10 Iraq has one of the largest oil reserves worth billions. Denmark doesn’t.
7646 2018-02-24 21:31:59 Shit I can get work gloves, CBD oil, pipes, hats, colored contacts, knives, get a oil change, work on the car and gas fam
7647 2018-02-24 21:31:58 Ahhh, the tinted liquid you see is the oil bath I’m using to heat up the bottom of the sublimator!
7648 2018-02-24 21:31:47 Grapeseed oil is not stupid
7649 2018-02-24 21:31:44 Three hot oil treatments coming. I just don't feel like going to thee Navel base.
7650 2018-02-24 21:31:42 I wonder if coconut oil really works for hair 
7651 2018-02-24 21:31:38 Anyhow if you think human waste is as toxic as dilbit, it's your right to have that biased opinion
But I know some places been pumping human waste into the ocean for 30 years and more
Imagine if that was oil?
Do you think the situation would be better or worse?
7652 2018-02-24 21:31:37 They probably couldn't change the oil or batteries in their cars as well.
7653 2018-02-24 21:31:14 Uhhhh. So how does he swim in oil? Wouldn't that be uncomfortable? Maybe robots would be fine with it. Probably too busy feeling the beat?
7654 2018-02-24 21:31:02 Better put "faith landed a Nigerian (hairdresser) an oil block"

7656 2018-02-24 21:30:55 Do. Not. Buy. Anything. Which. Contains. Palm. Oil. Thank you. From your cousin Orangutan
7657 2018-02-24 21:30:42 I aim to please…! I will now light the candle and rub Patchouli oil on my weary face…
7658 2018-02-24 21:30:37 The leftist know that the squeaky wheel always gets the oil. I was shocked to see the co. I work for on the list. But I  will figure a way around that for my customers. YOU BET!!!!

7662 2018-02-24 21:29:51 fish oil capsules helped me alot... plus lipitor...lol
7663 2018-02-24 21:29:51 If I were in your position, I would take this opportunity to sit in the feelings of people speaking up, educate myself on what people are saying about OIL, and practice responding to people speaking up about safety with a lot more grace than you've shown here.
7664 2018-02-24 21:29:41 I'd love to. Poor public transportation in US. You know..... oil lobby, auto lobby. Corporate profits come first.
7665 2018-02-24 21:29:35 Just oil the pan, Montreal steak seasoning, basil, oregano, and lime juice. Grill on high heat until they start to get soft or blacken!
7666 2018-02-24 21:29:32 I have a similar style piece from a local artist, 5x7 oil on canvas - her price was $75.

7672 2018-02-24 21:27:54 Went to get my oil changed & these fools told me I needed to change six of my tires, I only have four... said I was missing my steering wheel & my whole gas tank
7673 2018-02-24 21:27:37 MoJo, pls fix this misleading tweet & headline. When I read the phrase "autism community" I assume it's about a community made primarily of people who are #ActuallyAutistic. Your article is about neurotypical parents giving autistic kids snake oil.
7674 2018-02-24 21:27:27 Happy Shatterday!!! 10% off all oil and cartridges all day! Open until 8pm!
7675 2018-02-24 21:27:21 All it takes is a game of rugby to bring out the hate-filled, racist Engerlunders to surface. They hate anyone who isn’t Engerlish, unless they have that capitulating, subservient Britishness.  But they want Scots oil and whisky revenue for their financial security.  #Indy
7676 2018-02-24 21:26:48 Hahahaha. Daytona makes way for the nation’s bikers and NASCAR during Feb. and March.

We don’t really care about spring breakers.

Besides, let them take their woke selves somewhere else to spend daddy’s money.
7677 2018-02-24 21:26:36 Coconut oil! I use it for make up removal and shaving. It’s gotten rid of all the single wipes I would throw away every day, the wrapper, and the shaving cream can

And the jar it comes in can be reused after you use it all 
7678 2018-02-24 21:26:34 Hahaha nah it’s good! Coffee, coconut oil, and butter.  Gotta try it!
7679 2018-02-24 21:26:23 Hi @judythevet my friend was playing tug with another pal and today one side of her mouth is a little swollen. Can their human rub olive oil infused with clove onto her gum? Thank you 
7680 2018-02-24 21:26:19 So I spent all of my money on hair stuff and car oil today and now I only have $12 left
7681 2018-02-24 21:26:14 Ahh yeah that makes sense. I’ve been told to try aloe Vera mixed with tea tree oil so I’m gonna pick up some of that, and probably if that doesn’t help I’ll see the doc x
7682 2018-02-24 21:26:01 shea moisture has a jamaican black castor oil line
7683 2018-02-24 21:25:54 Yeah, regs like mine safety, oil rig inspections, coal plant emissions, and the like. You're a fuckin peach, for sure.

7685 2018-02-24 21:25:41 According to world bank estimates, 40% of oil and 60% of gas reserves in Middle East at risk of being stranded due to global #climatechange policies
7686 2018-02-24 21:25:29 2/2 russias economy depends on oil exports...The only logical explaination is repubs are russian agents! I know this.CNN,Ms-pms, wapo and nttimes said so.
7687 2018-02-24 21:24:47 finally ordered some jojoba oil. hoping it helps with my dry ass face and scalp 
7688 2018-02-24 21:24:38 yes, espcially ironic since Western governments and companies have been actively funding and propagating those conflicts for rights to oil and pipelines. Follow the money.
7689 2018-02-24 21:24:14 That will the confirmation WM has been waiting on regarding our oil running out then

7691 2018-02-24 21:23:59 The corporate donations to candidates must stop, corporations are not individuals, whether its big oil, guns, prescriptions, environmental, tobacco etc. THESE SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS DONATIONS MUST END or problems will never stop
7692 2018-02-24 21:23:59 Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:

~James 5:14
7693 2018-02-24 21:23:57 But you’d send them to die for oil. Coolio.
7694 2018-02-24 21:23:20 1 of 2I can sum it up....Republicans are covering up becuase all repubs are paid double agents of the KGB...The repubs must be working for Russians since they gave ukraine weapons, instituted tarriffs against russia, and are producing American oil to lower the price of oil . Russ
7695 2018-02-24 21:22:33 I just threw together some soy sauce, sesame oil, canola oil, honey, minced ginger, minced garlic, brown sugar, and rice vinegar and put it on diced chicken breast to marinate. I hope it turns out tasty.
7696 2018-02-24 21:22:02 HOW has my skin gone from oilier than a oil spill all my life to drier than the Sahara desert

7703 2018-02-24 21:20:40 When to ricart for an oil change, ended up leaving with a new car 
7704 2018-02-24 21:20:32 Oil chang taking longer than i thought
7705 2018-02-24 21:20:18 During yoga, Sam Brownback tries to convince Ben Carson that the Koch brothers are drilling for oil. Victoria Jackson makes a prophecy.
7706 2018-02-24 21:20:17 We relatively all agree despite historic liquidity, we are still in the late innings of the business cycle. Thus, do you think we will have the usual sinking $ and fabulous rise in most commodities including oil, this time?
7707 2018-02-24 21:19:59 Selling himself his own snake oil. Like his porcelain capped teeth.
7708 2018-02-24 21:19:57 Got a high mileage synthetic oil change and a new battery for my baby Vicki... she's actin all right now.

7713 2018-02-24 21:19:27 Everytime I get my oil changed they give me a car wash voucher. What yall trying to say?
7714 2018-02-24 21:19:26 @ScottPruittOK The Bible tells me that God gave us the sun, wind and water to supply us with the power we need. Oil and coal are to be left in the earth.

7721 2018-02-24 21:18:32 Hummus is chanay ka paste. They put olive oil in it. It's .
7722 2018-02-24 21:18:02 I knew it was gonna get kinky when he said to bring some hot wings and motor oil
7723 2018-02-24 21:17:48 Coffee and coconut oil to me was eh, but then I added butter. Whew!!! Game changer for me.

7726 2018-02-24 21:17:22 Hes just missing the baby oil to make him more aerodynamic.
7727 2018-02-24 21:17:16 Renewables are a great field of employment.  Do Republicans like renewables or do they like Russian oil and gas oligarchs who funnel money through the NRA?
7728 2018-02-24 21:17:12 
7729 2018-02-24 21:17:03 Oh no it's a "trade secret"
But you can be sure it's not sugar & spices or it wouldn't be a secret
But we are all well aware of the toxic chemicals present in the oil at least, I hope
The difference with dilbit is you can't clean it up
It'll be a long term source of contamination
7730 2018-02-24 21:17:02 Democrats are the best gun salesmen...sales are up everywhere, seeing people buying into NRA left and right....the left has no fucking clue how bad they're fucking up. You're pissing off the spending class who just happens to be armed, and controls most food and oil production.
7731 2018-02-24 21:16:52 My oil change was $80 dawg 
7732 2018-02-24 21:16:42 Venezuela has much more oil than Norway.  The difference is, among many other things, is Norway is a monetary sovereign while Venezuela pegs its currency and owes debts in foreign currencies.  Norway invested its oil money in the both diversifying its industries ...
7733 2018-02-24 21:16:31 Also the word for how adult producers at CNN got the narrative they wanted out of town hall.
7734 2018-02-24 21:16:25 Maybe on craigslist you can find people that want used oil to fuel their biodiesel engine on their VW bus.
7735 2018-02-24 21:16:11 Totally agree Brother this isn’t the way to get ministers onside. Prescription cannabis oil and recreational consumption need to be separated otherwise it ain’t ever happening
7736 2018-02-24 21:15:59 Check your facts, Mr. Morgan.  Once we bring back truth in media, you'll be out on your lying, spinning ass.  And truth is coming down the pike, for all of you gaslighting, arrogant snake oil salemen.  John Oliver has genuine interest in our collective health. #PiersIsTheFraud
7737 2018-02-24 21:15:55 I would also say that just because Big Oil outspends the NRA doesn't mean the NRA is thus powerless.
7738 2018-02-24 21:15:52 Davidson trade has nothing to do with any FWs contract.

If your saying Sekera & Russells deals are bad...they were Oilers best pair last year. 

Funny SO MANY PEOPLE shit on Russell. Yet he brings A LOT to the team. Unlike guys like Nikitan, Fayne, etc who got same $$ in Edm.
7739 2018-02-24 21:15:47 The most realistic so far. My hair is enjoying some coconut oil treatment… Are you working during Black Friday?
7740 2018-02-24 21:15:40 The dude is garbage. He’s the left-wing version of a snake oil salesman.
7741 2018-02-24 21:15:23 Oh Honey I live in Florida and I call BS on that. In fact, 9/11 hit the hotel industry very hard. The BP oil spill decimated the fishing industry and several local restaurants failed because of it. Imma gonna let you think about the hurricane part for yourself.
7742 2018-02-24 21:15:20 I kept telling myself to quit watching @TexasMBB & go get my oil changed. I just knew I would be disappointed. For some reason I kept messin’ around & ended up seeing the end. 65-64 Texas over OkState. Off to JiffyLube.

7750 2018-02-24 21:14:27 Huge @TigerWoods fan, but starting leaking oil at 16 #keepgrinding #followmebackgreeny
7751 2018-02-24 21:13:50 bottles of oil rule OK; sticks of incense rule OK; therefore sticks of incense are bottles of oil
7752 2018-02-24 21:13:49 The #Isles. The fact Chiarelli moved Davidson to NYI does this mean he will be a Homerun for the team on #LongIsland?
7753 2018-02-24 21:13:37 Nothing worse then olive oil drops in your ear
7754 2018-02-24 21:13:33 Like the ones allowing Coal waste dumped into water ways , allowing mental health patients to buy assault weapons , allowing oil company's to drill in Nation Parks , off shore of our oceans, credit card Co to charge whatever they deem fair & huge late fees?
7755 2018-02-24 21:13:32 I love how when chanyeol has nice arms they just slathered oil all over them
7756 2018-02-24 21:13:15 Can rich Nigerians stop telling us "Na God" or "It was by faith" and be more realistic... 

Who rejects an oil block please? 
7757 2018-02-24 21:13:11 Jelly babies were originally invented to put holes in their soup spoons to stop them hitting oil rigs.
7758 2018-02-24 21:13:01 Oil is used to make plastic. Credit cards are made of plastic, so you need oil to shop! How about that? #ClimateChange #GlobalWarming
7759 2018-02-24 21:12:52 With that said, at least Chiarelli got decent value for Davidson. Another chip to use on the draft floor.
7760 2018-02-24 21:12:46 I just noticed all the money-related emojis are bookended with an oil drum and a diamond

7774 2018-02-24 21:10:48 Fav essential oil brands???
7775 2018-02-24 21:10:34 Report back! Keep an eye on it since there's no fat in it. You may have to add more water or olive oil so it doesn't stick/burn.

7778 2018-02-24 21:10:13 Always pay attention to your grocery bill as it’s being rung up. My olive oil just rang through at $4+ more than the sale price listed on the shelf, so I got it for free.
7779 2018-02-24 21:10:13 @MaajidNawaz THC makes you high. NOT canababis oil! People on your show have no fact and they are embarrassing themselves! There is a vast difference between using cannabis oil and smoking a joint!

7785 2018-02-24 21:09:11 Don’t let him see a 5.7x28mm T6 round. Nasty round that packs a serious bite. 5.7 is my everyday carry.
7786 2018-02-24 21:09:03 Rofl. Come on. Here we go.

Who are you talking about?
7787 2018-02-24 21:08:48 Car wash inside and out and oil change .. my baby getting some tlc it's about time 
7788 2018-02-24 21:08:45 Don't know how it will go after ICO sales, but in the whitepaper it specifies 60$ value of Venezuelan oil barrel at a set date in february as the initial petro value, no mention of what BsF equivalence would be used thereafter.
7789 2018-02-24 21:08:42 I went to get a oil change & the guy who changed my oil said “if you’re gonna come up here & tease me with your booty shorts, next time, wear cotton ones” 
7790 2018-02-24 21:08:39 Yeah but it’s oil management we are talking about . All I’m saying is he will help the isle and get some decent minutes
7791 2018-02-24 21:08:38 Crude oil denominated (quoted) in USD, increasing the demand of USD.  If asset tokenisation takes off and asset prices mainly quoted in, say, ETH, you think it may matter to your estimate for network value of ETH?
7792 2018-02-24 21:08:37 Yeah, we can now dump our waste and old oil in the creek of a former national park.  Saves a lot of money! MAGA!
7793 2018-02-24 21:08:30 Not to mention that it was western capitalism that created innovated uses for that oil which is what gives it value.
7794 2018-02-24 21:08:30 Please check out the Gum Turpentine therapy for Parasite cleanse & overall health benefits. I did some research & will be trying it with Castor Oil & of course with a raw & steamed fruit & veggie diet.
7795 2018-02-24 21:08:25 The fact that Davidson is traded to the #Isles what are the chances this really works out well for the blue & orange?
7796 2018-02-24 21:08:21 American politicians intrest is only in the oil, not saving ppl, and they don’t care what the hell is going to happen to the civilian’s, so the only thing that America does there is making more enemies and waisting American soldiers lives.
7797 2018-02-24 21:08:02 Japan. They have no oil. And, take the long view.
7798 2018-02-24 21:08:00 & the Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Strengthen & Restore Treatment Masque that I've never seen for more than $2500 they have for $3300
7799 2018-02-24 21:07:56 I started an oil painting today and I'm absolutely baffled. How does oil painting work. And more importantly where can I get some cheap jars to store paint thinner.
7800 2018-02-24 21:07:35 Futurist view
Inflation and famine will plague the earth during World War III. Though many will starve, the wealthy will enjoy the luxuries of oil and wine.[17]
7801 2018-02-24 21:07:28 The way electrical turbines (oil, gas, hydro) work, they over-generate what the demand needs because they can't be easily ram up or down other than predicting when it would happen, made difficult by sharp fluctuations.
7802 2018-02-24 21:07:14 Fuck if I’m doing a survey about my serivce experience unless I’m getting a free oil change out of if, Nissan.
7803 2018-02-24 21:06:54 @SkyNews at 9, you are all confusing THC  with the medicinal canabanoids!!!! Cannabis oil does NOT make you high!!!!!
7804 2018-02-24 21:06:38 Guys Enrique did my oil change and bought me brand new tires. I’m speechless. I cried 
7805 2018-02-24 21:06:32 Nope, extra cheese, sliced tomatoes,onions, capers and garlic oil . Oh and sweet corn and pineapple depending on mood. But I’ve just downed a burger and shake so thank God I can discuss without desiring Pizza !
7806 2018-02-24 21:06:18 You just need to register an oil company and have access to be qualified to bid or apply for exploration license. Having a sound proposal and technical partners will help your bid. You may or may not get it in the end also.
7807 2018-02-24 21:06:13 Seems apt for my 66 Econoline and 66 Mustang. *heads out to fix a leaking transmission oil pan gasket*
7808 2018-02-24 21:06:12 Unfortuante to see Davidson go yet again but w/ the Oilers predicament being what it is on the backend, this is what happens. Hence the problem w/ signing guys to bad long term deals. Handcuffing 101
7809 2018-02-24 21:06:09 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
7810 2018-02-24 21:05:57 I'm sure that you realize that the USA produces more oil than we use. The Obama administration changed rules to now allow the USA to export oil. We are rocking with the fracking. We don't need offshore drilling we have plenty.
7811 2018-02-24 21:05:56 The Administration from stem to stern is filled to the brim with uncivilized 'men'. And as for this latest from Tillerson it only confirms what I suspected all along - oil waste product, not blood, runs though his veins.
7812 2018-02-24 21:05:55 So I think she owns an oil company, applied to the FG for an oil bloc, same way dem Adenuga and co applied and got the least desired bloc which then turned out to be good. 
Why she's the subject of rage in Twitter NG tonight is elusive to me. 
7813 2018-02-24 21:05:51 Oil
7814 2018-02-24 21:05:35 I wanna change my own oil, but I don't got the driveway to do it LOL
7815 2018-02-24 21:05:27 if that's all its takes then am sure the oil blocks ain't enough for all Nigerians who have faith
7816 2018-02-24 21:05:21 Can you guess where I’m at on this lovely Saturday ? You guessed it ! I’m at the car dealership getting an oil change  Oh happy day
7817 2018-02-24 21:05:18 United in the quest for oil... shameful
7818 2018-02-24 21:05:15 Well, nothing "extra".
I'll need the oil out at some point, and the anti vegf injections forever.

But anyway that's all just something I have to work with week by week.
As for this game tbh I wouldn't be entirely surprised if it IS a port of EOH. No bad thing though if so.
7819 2018-02-24 21:05:04 "I find quite different things beautiful: the look of broken glass, for example; or an oil puddle on the ground. Skin – is there anything more beautiful? Only smoke in the sky is almost that beautiful. Or wire. Teeth, too." - David Lynch #TwinPeaksDay

7822 2018-02-24 21:04:47 your bones need sunjuice
or if you really need either cod liver oil or opium poppy
7823 2018-02-24 21:04:35 Cost of oil change, tire rotation, and annual inspection because @VIPTiresService lets you stack promotions: Free. Excellent customer service and having a shop I can count on to treat me fairly: Priceless.
7824 2018-02-24 21:04:12 Orangutans need our attention.  Palm oil is an input to many many of our food products— we demand that manufacturers find and use ecologically sensitive substitutes NOW!
7825 2018-02-24 21:04:09 B4 U give up, get the thayers original. Not with rose petals. Then! Add differin gel & a good oil free moisturizer to ur routine.

and you don't know

we're on the same level
7833 2018-02-24 21:02:29 This administration has no strategy about anything except making the rich richer. Destroying public parks for oil and uranium and destroying an educational system that wasn’t doing to well in the first place. Sad times for the U S. Money speaks I guess. Sad!
7834 2018-02-24 21:02:13 And it’s not like Arizona is flushed like a Texas A&M with oil and SEC money. It is a public school in the Arizona desert with an academic reputation similar to Cal State Channel Islands.
7835 2018-02-24 21:02:13 How she got is actually hard work on its own. To get to the position of being gifted an Oil Bloc is not luck it's hard work.

7839 2018-02-24 21:01:54 Overhearing this couple talk in loving detail about neighborhood laundromats and their yearly budget. I'm over here eating cake and buying $20 olive oil I can't afford. Sigh. This world hates romantics.
7840 2018-02-24 21:01:46 I just want an oil block!!
7841 2018-02-24 21:01:40 Don't use coconut oil. Aquaphor!!!

7843 2018-02-24 21:01:22 hair done, bills paid, grocery store, oil change and a full tank of gas.. all on 4 hours of sleep omg go me
7844 2018-02-24 21:01:09 Thank you, yet don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
7845 2018-02-24 21:01:06 That doesn’t mean it’s gone definitely buy some poison and or traps. Ours was coming in and out from behind our kitchen appliances. I ran the dishwasher (we found it inside there) with peppermint oil, also put some around some entry points and that helped!
7846 2018-02-24 21:00:56 I need to get out of this bed and get my oil changed 
7847 2018-02-24 21:00:54 Miracle is just a premium engine oil.
7848 2018-02-24 21:00:53 Why not it gives them a way to sell oil to companies and countries that are not allowed to buy oil from them legally due to sanctions.
7849 2018-02-24 21:00:27 people are looking online for "garlic cloves in oil"

7854 2018-02-24 21:00:13 It is also NOT TRUE that price "will fluctuate on top" of oil barrel price. Its whitepaper emphasizes petro's "stability" compared to other cryptos BECAUSE it's pegged on the price of one Venezuelan oil barrel.

7859 2018-02-24 21:00:01 Did you know that one of the benefits of CBD oil is anxiety relief? Some other benefits include reducing seizures, helping to combat neurodegenerative disorders, relieving pain for symptoms caused by arthritis and similar issues,

7869 2018-02-24 20:58:46 You cannot deny me my rights as a citizen because the idiots in Salem aren’t listening to me.
7870 2018-02-24 20:58:31 what's the correlation between having an oil well in your name and having a degree ??? Honestly nothing , anyone could have ..
7871 2018-02-24 20:58:09 Así es. Va a ser enorme y también le puede poner un techo al oil. Por ahora es up el WTI a mediano plazo.

7876 2018-02-24 20:57:10 Toni looks like he has baby oil on his body
7877 2018-02-24 20:57:10 Remember when POTUS Clinton forgot to include royalties for the gov't from oil drilled under new leases in his administration?  Was that really an oversight?
7878 2018-02-24 20:57:10 @CoreyLMJones you look like another snake oil salesman. You have a look. bow tie, the coiffed blonde hair. The right is an easy con.
7879 2018-02-24 20:57:08 Pretty sure my tea tree oil spilled in my luggage and now the whole shuttle smells like tea tree and the driver is taking his sweet time
7880 2018-02-24 20:56:46 Oil fields are beautiful.  Perhaps you preferred killing sperm whales for 100x-more-costly oil?  Perhaps you preferred darkness?
7881 2018-02-24 20:56:24 Goalies wanna play..he probably feels better the more he plays, kinda like Talbot for the Oil last season
7882 2018-02-24 20:56:09 Is it just me, or could Papadopolous’ forehead be the next place we frack for oil?
7883 2018-02-24 20:55:58 Hey @WVGovernor . How about you stop giving tax breaks to the dozens of gas/oil companies and then use all that potential tax money to pay your educators what they're worth?
7884 2018-02-24 20:55:56 Because the mighty mighty Oil have shown such ability to turn 3rd rounders into solid AHL plumbers.

7887 2018-02-24 20:55:28 I went vegan a few months ago for health reasons. Good chance I would be dead now without oil free vegan WFPB. #februdairy has made me aware of the ethical side. Individual extreme cases like this kept me up into the small hours as a uni student, these days I apply common sense.
7888 2018-02-24 20:55:27 so season the fish, egg wash, four or cornmeal, then into the hot oil?
7889 2018-02-24 20:55:18 Coconut oil gets a bad rap but JBCO was always my enemy. It’s cool as an ingredient in a product, but by itself is way too heavy for my hair
7890 2018-02-24 20:55:15 As long as Islamic Republic of mullahs in Iran is , we will never seen peace in middle east. As long as Russian take free oil and gas from Islamic Republic and support Ayatollah ,
7891 2018-02-24 20:55:12 The itching stage of tattoos <<<<< ahhhhhhh and I’m out of coconut oil
7892 2018-02-24 20:55:08 Look at Nigeria too. A country producing oil and gas. But can’t provide stable power to citizens. Wrap the whole country and sink it into the Niger delta or something. Ah!
7893 2018-02-24 20:55:03 @edbegleyjr As a vegan and environmentalist do you avoid products containing palm oil?  #GoVegan
7894 2018-02-24 20:54:57 Translated: as soon as the $500 billion oil deal is done.
7895 2018-02-24 20:54:19 Alaska needs #lingusticemergencydeclaration increased broadband is like dripping soap on a oil spill. Unless broadband = direct rural access and fluid engagement in REAL ID Act Comply background checks, quality fingerprinting services; more Internet is more vulnerable.
7896 2018-02-24 20:54:05 Yes, Iraq taking further oil supplies in Kuwait is an encouragement or terrorism against America. Give me a break  The US was protecting it's allies and interests in (terrorist funding) Saudi Arabia. At least identify that.
7897 2018-02-24 20:54:02 Cold, dirty, wet, and drenched in oil, can't ask for anything more.
7898 2018-02-24 20:54:02 My legs are dangling off the edge,
The bottom of the bottle is my only friend,
I think I'll slit my wrists again and I'm gone, gone, gone,
My legs are dangling off the edge,
A stomach full of pills didn't work again,
I'll put a bullet in my head and I'm gone, gone, gone.
7899 2018-02-24 20:53:51 As a career in illinois with loading and mixing commercially herbicides, insect. and fung. on row crops. Off and on I have had some splash that mostly got on my forearms and shirts and pants, pouring 2.5gals into different inductors. A little had got in my mouth taste like oil.
7900 2018-02-24 20:53:45 Eat a gradually increasing amount of cannabis oil each day then level out the dose, and taper back down after the tumor is gone.  Get to Colorado, or Wisconsin if your in a hater state.

7904 2018-02-24 20:53:21 ahhhhhh so you're one of those fake Barca fans that actually support City, they won't dominate because they're some huge club, they'll be very successful because they're run by criminals and oil money!!! without sheikh mansour they'd be portsmouth!

7908 2018-02-24 20:52:55 Gentle reminder that lavender and coconut oil hydrating spritz cannot be used as a finishing spray to give your make up a bit of a dewy finish. You will suffer, ok?
7909 2018-02-24 20:52:55 If you want amazingly soft hair, try out Garnier Ultimate Blends With Avocado Oil and Shea Butter Shampoo+Conditioner..

7910 2018-02-24 20:52:48 The Oil also got half a pail of pucks in the trade. Who’s laughing now?
7911 2018-02-24 20:52:45 This woman behind me at Lil Joe’s just ordered a small pizza with pineapple and onions with olive oil and no sauce 
7912 2018-02-24 20:52:44 20% of the worlds oil reserve. Something is fundamentally wrong. I get sad when I see women and children queue for food. Chavez did no investments in the industry. Corruption basaa! No cash in the system. This one too is a President oo. 
7913 2018-02-24 20:52:26 I can't stand the oil smell that fried foods leave in your clothes.
7914 2018-02-24 20:52:22 The WADA and USADA (anti-doping agencies) have banned Flonase and inhalers due to them technically being steroidal... Hope you don’t get allergies or asthma.  However they have legalized CBD oil, so enjoy the muscle recovery and relaxation!
7915 2018-02-24 20:52:14 The professor is full of sh_t. A lot of Sunni Tribes were recruited by ISIS to run the Syrian oil fields where they lived and do other tasks. When #SDF/US captured them, they were vetted and some joined #SDF, some were released as non-combatants, and the remainder detained.
7916 2018-02-24 20:52:04 Make sure you network with oil block people sha o
7917 2018-02-24 20:52:03 Y Russia excluded when there is evidence of oil trade with NK? not to mention Russian sanctions voted by YOU not implemented? Russian mercenaries are now attacking U.S. troops with Kremlin approval.

7921 2018-02-24 20:51:33 Can we be real here, folks? I know few responsible gun owners who even own an AR-15. Everytime we see someone at the range who's spent $4k on a glorified plastic varmint rifle they CQBed the picatinny rails up with, that they gotta clean with synthetic oil, we roll our eyes.
7922 2018-02-24 20:51:29 Bad when oil is more important than food
7923 2018-02-24 20:51:28 Cruz will get Russian oil money through the NRA
7924 2018-02-24 20:51:24 Agreed, but I prefer eucalyptus oil!

7930 2018-02-24 20:50:41 You are insane and dangerous. You want to keep giving money to your friends with the guns, oil, jails and everything that is wrong with the world. I hope Americans do something about this before it’s too late.
7931 2018-02-24 20:50:30 It's relaxing with lights off candles going and a little lavender essential oil to relax
7932 2018-02-24 20:50:22 why are you even trying? you re putting the biggest club in the world vs a club with no history or fans and only oil money to show for it.
7933 2018-02-24 20:50:11 No post but I have two drivers. We kept my old SUV when I bought a new to me van. They drive that & pay for gas, oil changes and the difference in insurance. We pay for any repairs.
7934 2018-02-24 20:50:01 @zikkylambo what rubbish. A president gave out an oil block in the SS to a lady from the SW for doing absolutely nothing. We as a people are a huge joke. Nigerian isn't ready for greatness yet
7935 2018-02-24 20:49:58 They have the biggest oil resource and they've run out of gas. That is socialism.

7941 2018-02-24 20:49:14 I know all about dead zones, but that does not even come close to the toxicity of dilbit. It's not crude oil you know. Dilbit can have 30% diluents or more which is a  toxic mixture of cancer causing chemicals which will sink to the bottom and contaminate for decades

7948 2018-02-24 20:48:36 I was asked to stay in my car during my oil change and the dude kept coming to talk to me about other unrelated stuff, trying to flirt, which was weird and I just got handed a receipt and this guy really gave me a free oil change and said “come back soon” & winked. IM DEAD.
7949 2018-02-24 20:48:28 Coal is dead. Oil is killing us. Solar and wind are the future.
7950 2018-02-24 20:48:26 It'd be great if at some point, Oiler management would look beyond the Oil Kings and WHL in general for talent in junior hockey.

7960 2018-02-24 20:46:07 Buffet paid Obama all those years not to approve the XL Pipe Line. So he could continue hauling  the oil to the US on his trains .
7961 2018-02-24 20:46:06 Great news! Cleaner air less pollutants to destroy the ozone layer and keeping big oil from profiting off killing people and the earth. @RyanZinke is a traitor just like @realDonaldTrump.

7964 2018-02-24 20:45:48 I’m all for the use of CBD oil for many different reasons. This isn’t a single person on this earth that’s never been through a time of depression. I understand what you’re saying.
7965 2018-02-24 20:45:45 @moniqueparent Boil food. Use extra virgin olive oil if frying. For energy eat pasta; plain not with sodium, fat and calorie laden sauces. Minimize alcohol. My two cents worth of unsolicited dietary advice to lose weight. Lol.

7969 2018-02-24 20:45:05 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
7970 2018-02-24 20:44:54 Twitter is censoring your post as ‘potentially sensitive’. 
7971 2018-02-24 20:44:40 "Harvest" says to me that you're working with a renewable resource where you can save part back, plant, and use some of the offspring. Mr Pruitt's oil, coal, and gas extraction is akin to eating your seed corn. There is no 'And do it again next year.'
7972 2018-02-24 20:44:33 Hanging out at Stocker Chevrolet  experimenting w this new car trend called getting the oil changed. Let's see how it goes!
7973 2018-02-24 20:44:23 Thank you Mr. President trump. The Iranian people demand regiem change for Iran and as long as Islamic Republic of mullahs are in Iran we wil never seen peace in middle east and Russia forty year support mullah for free oil and gas.
7974 2018-02-24 20:44:22 @NHRAAllAccess Is the feed down? It worked fine during Lucas Oil coverage, but now that Mello Yellow coverage should start it's buffering and stuck.
7975 2018-02-24 20:44:21 He’s not in with the cool kids.
7976 2018-02-24 20:44:08 girl I have some just sitting there collecting dust. I’ll start using it. Do I do it like an hot oil treatment?
7977 2018-02-24 20:44:05 It's the first time I see this beer or juice ...or oil bottle
7978 2018-02-24 20:44:04 Wait a min fighting idiot!! Planned parenthood kills hundreds of thousands of babies and buys more politicians than an oil company. The @NRA offers nothing but gun safety training and does not support the actions of these psychos that shoot up schools and concerts. GAFC!!
7979 2018-02-24 20:44:00 Oil box*
7980 2018-02-24 20:43:58 Please can you stop telling us this trash instead tell it to your northern governors and elite so you earn revenue and not to depend on oil
7981 2018-02-24 20:43:55 It always seems like a good idea to go get your oil changed, ya know, getting your shit together

Then you are waiting about 5 years for your car to be done
7982 2018-02-24 20:43:39 They traded him for Desharnais because they were deep on the left side and would lose him for nothing in the expansion draft. LHD is easily the deepest position for the Oil so he’s been expendable twice.
7983 2018-02-24 20:43:35 <///< plan for tonight... a sleeping pill and a shot of castor oil... hehe
7984 2018-02-24 20:43:30 Right? Guys on his 4th team now in 2 years. Montreal gave him away for nothing, oil actually get something for him and all the armchair gm’s still crying 
7985 2018-02-24 20:43:18 They’re kind of locked into a groupthink now, I’m guessing as a result of the trauma combined with teenage cliquishness. It would probably only take one or two to break away from it to shatter it, but the cool kids are running the show right now.
7986 2018-02-24 20:43:12 As well as oil corps stealing oil from Ukraine in Caspian Sea which is why CIA is so active in Ukraine.

7988 2018-02-24 20:42:59 I blame ourselves for sabotaging the 1951 democratically elected government of Iran for oil and create a totalitarian environment that only religious fanaticism could break.
7989 2018-02-24 20:42:58 Natural gas, coal and oil are examples of what type of fuel? #trivia
7990 2018-02-24 20:42:47 because we don't have oil...

7992 2018-02-24 20:42:14 Black currant oil is extraordinarily high in vitamin C and is also rich in many other nutrients. It can greatly ease breast tenderness.
7993 2018-02-24 20:42:10 ugh u gmfu i need that oil, u see this hair?? y’all don’t need it. i’m blew
7994 2018-02-24 20:42:03 I was 1st generation born in Texas. Mom and Dad migrated here to work in oil refineries
7995 2018-02-24 20:42:02 This lady really messed up my eyebrows I been putting castor oil on em so they can hurry up & grow back
7996 2018-02-24 20:41:14 Use castor oil to thicken it up
7997 2018-02-24 20:40:59 that’s even worse! Plus the oil makes my face even Oiler. I use micellar neutrogena water usually

8006 2018-02-24 20:39:24 Americans are not dying in a regime change war in Syria but Syrians have been dying in their rebellion against Assad since 2011. Opposing Assad doesn't mean support for the US wars but ignoring his crimes, doesn't help Syrians end the conflict. FYI no oil in Syria

8009 2018-02-24 20:39:00 I think you have to cook them slower if you don’t use bucket loads of oil.
8010 2018-02-24 20:38:50 yep
8011 2018-02-24 20:38:28 @kevinolearytv  How does one invest in Olive Oil ? Can you make any suggestions! Thanks.

8016 2018-02-24 20:38:00 Oil blocs that are worth billions of dollars were given to friends, family , girlfriends etc for free and those who benefitted now have guts to rub it in our faces. One day all of you will be brought to justice. It's just a matter of time.

8020 2018-02-24 20:37:29 Some small-caps not in the portfolio that are of interest. $BNE so far stands out as the leader, $PXX a heavy oil producer, $GXE another heavy  producer and $IPO 70% liquids.  Would be more inclined to add $BNE and $PXX to the portfolio.
8021 2018-02-24 20:37:29 Because that's what she keeps saying or reiterating. Link you sent just showed a BTTS for the interview. Like someone suggested, she's getting this much stick because she's trying to gain respect when she knows that people know she got the oil bloc 1 kain.

8032 2018-02-24 20:35:56 No kid for the weekend and I was thinking “Oh I can do all kinds of fun things!!” So far I’ve gotten an oil change. Turn up.
8033 2018-02-24 20:35:50 Best buttter ever. Kerry Gold. Finished off my fish cakes w/ it last night. Much better than olive oil. Nice looking spread.

8035 2018-02-24 20:35:24 Go ahead attack the NRA, its spending on lobbying is a joke compared to real estate, unions, pharmaceuticals, insurance, oil, financial institutions, tech, and the chamber of commerce. Maybe it's actually just something people believe in.

8039 2018-02-24 20:34:56 I HATE THE SEC PLANNED THE BP OIL SPILL.
8040 2018-02-24 20:34:40 Nice chicken stir fry I just had but there was so much oil in the finished product, it’s probably wiped out my hard ride through Richmond Park this afternoon. And I still have a bed to build after this afternoon’s disaster.
8041 2018-02-24 20:34:10 This administration is not above the law. Policy untethered from a factual basis is not governance—it is merely expressing a preference, in this case for oil and gas companies over the American people. Thanks for highlighting with this thread!
8042 2018-02-24 20:34:10 Today started @FirkinShed with wonderful @SirenCraftBrew Honey Bunny, followed by trip to the Vitality and a 2 goal come back from @afcbournemouth (against the Toon) a victory for @officialcufc and a trip to @butchersdogbar for a @BeavertownBeer Neck Oil. Today was a good day!

8044 2018-02-24 20:33:31 I feel like I am in desperate need of a beach vacation with a chunky ginger cowboy putting tanning oil on me while I smoke a joint
8045 2018-02-24 20:33:28 Meanwhile we allowed big oil and big industry to pollute and endanger nature so we could have big cars, and cheap gas. But we were really comfortable.
8046 2018-02-24 20:33:16 Yeah except a one night stand will fuck you in a good way  the rats rigged their own election & then blamed everybody who told them not to do it, & of course Russia because they're standing in the way of acquiring more oil for US oligarchs. I don't believe a damn thing they say
8047 2018-02-24 20:33:06 You all know that this debate would be entirely different if we got at the root of many problems facing this nation and reasonable discussions regarding policy and national interests rather than competing private interests; oil, pharma, pesticides, guns...End Citizens United.
8048 2018-02-24 20:33:02 For my birthday all I want is a Toyota gift card for an oil change and to get my aux connection fixed. And windshield wipers and just wiper fluid  Thanks in advance!!!

8054 2018-02-24 20:32:17 And y'all don't know the first thing about playing at Lucas Oil Field
8055 2018-02-24 20:32:11 Did @POTUS sanction the 2 countries bringing in the oil and coal? Nope no sanctions on Russia or China. So I think the oil and coal will keep coming. And anything else they want to send to North Korea. Just common sense there.
8056 2018-02-24 20:31:54 “It is the year 2018. The United States—long-embroiled in the Oil Wars— builds a wall along the Mexican border, and creates an elite and heavily-armed taskforce to teach secondary school.” I feel like I rented this movie on VHS back in the 90’s.
8057 2018-02-24 20:31:47 True. Yet the Bolivar is not a free floating currency, but rather garbage. So you'd redeem a Petro to get the worth of a barrel of oil in garbage. Do you like trash? I do not.
8058 2018-02-24 20:31:43 Your relatives might need that insurance if you do that!
In fact, I’m going to suggest it for their next advert story line!
“Oh no! Mum’s eating crude oil sandwiches. Again. Better give BS Insurance a call...” 
8059 2018-02-24 20:31:34 Arming teachers instead of common sense gun legislation is as dumb as when Michael bay decided it's easier to teach oil drillers to becoming astronauts rather than teaching astronauts to be oil drillers. Entertaining movie, not realistic #TeachersAndGunsDontMix #armageddon
8060 2018-02-24 20:31:34 Many say this crap isn’t affected and doesn’t work! Snake oil garbage 
8061 2018-02-24 20:31:33 I'm going to YouTube it once we're done getting an oil change lol.

8073 2018-02-24 20:29:24 The Arabs were sat on an ocean of oil for every day that they have existed, it took an American to realise its potential. Let’s not forget that the United States was the first country to actively seek oil.

Pero el sector petrolero es muy lento y para recuperarse de la desinversion K que hubo va a tardar tiempo. Vaca muerta es más tight gas q  oil.
8082 2018-02-24 20:27:47 I just put oil in it like 2 weeks ago tho

8086 2018-02-24 20:27:04 If you read the story well you would realise that Maryam Babangida's influence was to get into the industry. Her applying to get the oil block was an idea she had much later on.

8094 2018-02-24 20:25:14 So I’m getting my oil changed and the mechanic was like “you been smoking some good shit haven’t you? and tried to cover it up with some body spray... don’t worry I do the same thing” 
8095 2018-02-24 20:25:11 Here we go a jock winging about oil blah blah blah. Unlike the EU that hates democracy and disrespects democracy the UK gov gave Scotland a ref. However Catalonia had a ref enough said.  Spain imprisons politicians what does the EU say. ???

8097 2018-02-24 20:25:05 Great ideas come from people thinking outside of the box. Just like creating sushi cakes, Eco Refill Systems is thinking outside of the box when it comes to how cooking oil is being consumed. Follow our website to find out more details about our services.
8098 2018-02-24 20:24:46 Just look at Venezuela. A country with so much promise. Contributes a high percentage of oil in the world market. But they’re queuing for food now. Political transition has marred everything there. There’s nothing there.

8103 2018-02-24 20:24:09 Oil Prospecting Lease (OPL) and Oil Mining Lease(OML) are the two licenses given by FG. First u get to prospect(search) for oil, if successful u apply for OML. An OML isn't cheap, and should normally be put up for bidding and not handed to one person just like that.
8104 2018-02-24 20:24:01 I just hate the way they make me feel!! Every single one I’ve been in makes me feel like I’ve had about twenty coffees and I always wind up talking a 200mph and they make feel so angry!! Cbd oil is working for me at the moment (well it works with the anxiety) x

Oreos contain high amounts of fat and sugar, as well as hydrogenated oil which is considered to be bad for a person's health. A study also indicates that Oreo cookies may be as addictive as cocaine.

8112 2018-02-24 20:22:37 Toronto has done it. Windsor has done it also. McKenna can no longer justify her position. She has disavowed any actions yet feels the right to feminize the oil industry. @jkenney @MichelleRempel
8113 2018-02-24 20:22:03 A pipeline is the safest way to move oil, and a new pipeline is safer than an old one. Why doesn’t #KinderMorgan build two new pipelines and then decommission the old one?
#TransMountain gets safer.
8114 2018-02-24 20:22:02 CN just went through Quill Lake with another 100 oil cars. Second one this week that I’ve seen. not a single grain car on either train. Went right by 50 full grain cars at P&H.

8118 2018-02-24 20:21:21 In Michigan for a thing and my parents took my car in for me for new tires, brakes and an oil change. They called me with the bill. $1520. I just died a little.

8156 2018-02-24 20:13:32 Just bc I’m hving fun with this...do you know of an oil lobbying group which works to raise prices for their manufacturers, get laws passed that ensure no one can stop using their oil no matter how it kills their family? Yet, says the people pay them to do that? I think not.

8197 2018-02-24 20:07:58 Those steaks look perfectly edible. I think you messed up by putting oil in the pan in the oven and that's why it was popping, especially if the pan was a little wet going in. Next time just don't use oil, those steaks will grease the pan anyway as the juices come out.

8211 2018-02-24 20:06:28 It's not so much a question of him being wrong. He makes his living cleaning up big oil's mess's. He has a financial interest in having oil spills to clean up. In his eyes oil spills are good for the economy. Promoting #KM is bad enough, but hoping for a spill for profit?

8222 2018-02-24 20:03:38 I'm curious of the methology of how they arrived at those numbers. If it's anything like how big oil funds politicians, it's private owners who work for those respective companies donating money.
8223 2018-02-24 20:03:19 I wouldn't say that so much as there wasn't as much opportunity, he played better than others, hoping oil resign him next year for 3rd pairing if needed.

8247 2018-02-24 20:00:18 They should also phase out (over maybe 4 years?) subsidies to wheat, corn, soy, oil (petroleum), sugar & banks.

8249 2018-02-24 19:59:44 I never knew oil blocks where “unwanted” in Nigeria 
8250 2018-02-24 19:59:36 A lot of car dealerships do more oil changes than car sales.  They're still car dealships.
8251 2018-02-24 19:59:35 One could say, let's not be so crude to oil.  Har har..
8252 2018-02-24 19:59:15 I toss it with olive oil and a squeeze of fresh lemon.
8253 2018-02-24 19:59:15 I'm waiting for my oil change to finish and angrily eating my weight in free tacos at this dealership. How's your Saturday going?
8254 2018-02-24 19:59:14 We wouldn’t need to shoot them. We could just toss them off with a big slingshot like device. Could save big money on fuel. Oil companies must be behind the cover up.
8255 2018-02-24 19:59:13 ARMING TEACHERS. How about trained dog packs that attack the smell of gun oil or powder. Perhaps robots that terrorize those who carry guns of any kind?
8256 2018-02-24 19:58:52 Absolutely, it was pretty funny this week I did a test “ let’s point out how many vegan meals/snack etc unconsciously we eat everyday “& italian meals/snacks came on top,lots of meals made with olive oil / veg , olives as savoury snack,also ppl prefering savioury to sweet xx

8259 2018-02-24 19:58:14 Would Burky look good on the Oil?
8260 2018-02-24 19:58:06 I recommend fish oil (or a vegan equivalent from microalgae that contains EPA and DHA) over starflower oil. Or eat fatty fish (salmon, tuna, mackerel) 2-3 x per week to get the beneficial omega-3 fatty acids, which research shows help reduce feelings of depression.

8263 2018-02-24 19:57:36 It is an acquired taste, it happens to be something I was born liking lol. It is an easy fat boost,I start every morning with a cup of fattened up coffee, I like half coconut oil half grass fed butter,if I put 2 tbls each I get about 50g and that keeps me going for a long time
8264 2018-02-24 19:57:23 the president has many friends wether real or fake, if out of let's say 3,000 friends at a time God decides to favour you and the president gives you oil bloc won't you attribute it to God?
8265 2018-02-24 19:57:22 Defend our country at 18 but not old enough to make a decision to buy a rifle?  I used a rocket launcher, hand grenades, M-60 automatic at 18 and if called in to battle then off I go.  If i stay home at 18 & work on an oil rig you tell me NO to buy a .308 rifle?  Not a gun issue.

8269 2018-02-24 19:57:03 Guys I’ve never gotten an actual oil change, my neighbor has done it but they moved away. Do I have to wait here?? I have stuff to do

8272 2018-02-24 19:56:56 Any country that refuses to recognize Jerusalem as the eternal and indivisible capital of Israel will face oil embargo from the Rep of Biafra.
8273 2018-02-24 19:56:42 Everyone who is not Syrian should leave and everyone who stays should be considered an invading force! Syria controls Syria, that includes oil fields and pipelines. The people who think they own the world have kept this war going! UN Security Council

8276 2018-02-24 19:55:55 1.2 avoid smudging of eyeliner, make sure the eyelids are grease/oil free. You can ensure this by using a makeup remover. To get that perfect look, keep your eyes open while using eye -liner. It is a little difficult at the beginning but you will eventually get hold of the trick.
8277 2018-02-24 19:55:51 O City Hall, suffering Eastern sweats Oil and a strange tale, perhaps as they will I shouldn’t be a little.

8279 2018-02-24 19:55:35 @KahlenBarry i want a makeup routine because i want to know if you either have face oil or highlight on your nose 
8280 2018-02-24 19:55:34 Russia wants to secure the following in Syria
The interests of extending the oil and gas pipelines and laying the hand on the new reservoirs
The interests of the Black Sea Fleet
Test and sell new weapons
The monopoly of nuclear energy markets
The expulsion of rival states

8287 2018-02-24 19:54:50 The oil pattern on these lanes are some of the worst we’ve experienced. Either over oiling or these are spanking new lanes. A straight ball curves to the gutter a mere inches before the pins . Never seen anything like it.

8290 2018-02-24 19:54:38 She’s just saying that people shouldn’t use coconut oil as a makeup remover or a moisturizer so she created a healthy alternative for your skin. She has tweeted several times about using it, it’s just the way she talks.

8293 2018-02-24 19:54:05 Last thing.  There better be an IOU from Snow back to Chia yet for this sweet deal for the Isles.  So if the Isles come out of left field and pursue Maroon, then something like Beauvillier better be coming back to the OIl.

8300 2018-02-24 19:53:12 Nikki Haley is a war profiteering neo-con who couldn't care less about Syrians. The US is killing record numbers of Syrian civilians, won't let Syrian gov. reclaim their oil fields, and were never given permission to even be in the country. "UN Security Council"

8317 2018-02-24 19:50:04 What's the theory again? Is it that the oil keeps it from going off?

8323 2018-02-24 19:48:44 Can there really be a downside to being gifted an oil bloc? I mean even if you turned right around and sold it for a stupid1 million naira price. Where's the downside. 
Alakija should chill abeg
8324 2018-02-24 19:48:40 I think you are right Jaymie! My question is why they chose the Ranger as a mascot instead of something oil related. But we may never know!
8325 2018-02-24 19:48:31 Danny, this happened to me this September.  If you can find an emergency dentist they might be able to put a temporary crown on it.  But besides that, isolate it, clove oil, anbesol, and ibuprofen.  Sorry.  It sucks.
8326 2018-02-24 19:48:27 Billy Graham was just another con man like DJT.  These evangelical tv ministers are no diff from snake oil salesmen of the past.  They fleece their followers so they can live lavish lifestyles on the delusional dime.

8328 2018-02-24 19:48:09 Krishnam Guru-Murthy #C4News frm Damascus actually reports that REBELS FIRING ON AND KILLING CIVILIANS & interviews Syrian minister who explains “rebels” threaten Damascus
Next, report on funders of “rebels”, Golan land & oil theft & attempts to steal gas/oil pipeline from Assad?
8329 2018-02-24 19:48:07 I agree completely.   He has 220K followers. That's scary.
8330 2018-02-24 19:47:34 Just know that the day we meet in person I will think of this thread & possibly dab a little blessed oil on you
8331 2018-02-24 19:47:23 Love it! Can't forget when we boycotted Shell Oil in the 70's. Those gas stations were empty!
8332 2018-02-24 19:47:14 Can you even believe we're still running vehicles on fossil fuels when there are so many cheap/clean alternatives that could be used?

Kudos to the oil industry & the governments in its back pocket for keeping us in the Stone Age. We can thank them for these public transit cuts.

8336 2018-02-24 19:46:59 Still a nope on this. The current batch of conservative tears tastes like corruption and gun oil.
8337 2018-02-24 19:46:53 Fruit of the Earth is the outlet I used in my neighborhood. I like that they import their CBD oil from Switzerland, which is rather strict and is known for their precision. Sumo has been on it for a tumor in his belly since March 2017. CBD seems to benefit various ailments.

8340 2018-02-24 19:46:39 It's scary how difficult it is to avoid palm oil! I still personally wonder why it's in so many things. Surely it can be replaced with a less destructive and preferably local and sustainable ingredient!
8341 2018-02-24 19:46:36 Can’t out slick a can of oil

8346 2018-02-24 19:45:48 So, strategic recap?
- Russia's interests (bases, Mediterranean ally) are secured by Assad holding western Syria. OK with de facto division of the country.
- Assad wants to re-take the east for economic (oil fields) and ideological reasons.
8347 2018-02-24 19:45:35 @nikkihaley Seriously Nikki Haley! Give a “So Called Cease Fire”

8348 2018-02-24 19:45:33 I think I know what you're talking about. Like how it kinda looks like there's oil on top? Like a shimmery film to the milk?
8349 2018-02-24 19:45:20 Yes Alakija got oil bloc from the back door but that woman put in work before she could reap the profit .
8350 2018-02-24 19:45:19 Would you reject an oil block?  

Answer with the fear of God.
8351 2018-02-24 19:44:56 3/ Because Russian oil companies have heavily invested during the downturn, they will be ideally placed to profit of a likely oil spike (BRENT touching 100 USD within 24 months). The current US oil inventory plunge (counter cyclical for Q1) supports this analysis.
8352 2018-02-24 19:44:52 Well I don't love it by any stretch. Not my thing and never have been. I add 2 tbls of coconut oil, sugar free coffee syrup & 2 packs of artificial sweetener and I can drink it lol. Can't do the butter in it. It gets me some fat 1st thing in the morning so it serves it's purpose
8353 2018-02-24 19:44:51 Swords: clean the blood off before sheathing it, keep it oiled and polished and sharpened, work out dents, never bang it against something for no reason. Can be bent in battle but can be bent back. Costly status symbol. Oil or wax handle or it cracks.

8384 2018-02-24 19:40:14 @joeycamasta do you have any recommendations for a glowy shimmering body oil/moisturiser? 
8385 2018-02-24 19:40:10 good. the introduction of palm oil is unsustainable in its sorce.  And tastes vile.!

8393 2018-02-24 19:39:07 @emmabahi is an esthetician and she’s very educated on skin and what helps and what doesn’t. That’s why her business is so successful, coconut oil, good for your hair, horrible for skin. Trust her!

8400 2018-02-24 19:38:06 DEW ITTT!! Hair is quite damaged rn because it's been bleached twice, but deep conditioning at home every 2 weeks with a coconut oil then hair mask helps keep it under control. Obvsly going to the salon for a creambath would be better but it's $$$ here
8401 2018-02-24 19:38:05 Will the OPEC cuts bring oil price to $80 by the end of the year? Seems as if the worries of increasing oil stocks will be temporary #API #CushingOK #WeeklyPetroleumStatusReport
8402 2018-02-24 19:37:49 Nothing like an afternoon epsom soak with copaiba oil to restore the legs.
8403 2018-02-24 19:37:39 Women and girls in villages, farms or fishing grounds that are located close to oil facilities are at most risk of sexual abuse,  - daily harassment, prostitution and rape - by oil workers both foreign and Nigerian including security guards.
8404 2018-02-24 19:37:34 Oil producingnations have all faced economic challenges in recent times.  Unfortunately only Norway diversified from oil

"Take our oil!"
"Why do not they take tiny Norway and take oil?"

8415 2018-02-24 19:34:42 Isn't  Stony Plain one of the richest Indian bands in Canada due to oil revenue?
8416 2018-02-24 19:34:38 2/ Oil with an API above 40 cannot be used for making diesel and kerosene (!) while Ural blend can be used to create all types of products! This huge difference is carefully hidden by the mainstream media to preserve the US shale myth!
8417 2018-02-24 19:34:28 Of course she can't make them on her own, but vibrations can be made just by moving something unbalanced. Phone vibrations work like that anyway. That's gotta be more sustainable than a gas-powered lighter, right?

But what about the fuel...? They could burn oil from animals.»
8418 2018-02-24 19:34:27 Shit, we could even go with something less popular. How about “In Shezmu We Trust”

(Shezmu: Egyptian god of wine and oil presses who also slaughtered condemned souls)
8419 2018-02-24 19:34:25 You would not had made this statement if she was part of your family......nobody is stopping you from inherit your own share from national assets and oil well, afterall  you're also a Nigerian.
8420 2018-02-24 19:34:24 We suffer the same heavy oil consumption and they just blatantly refuse, there is a #AudiUK case on the net proving the manufacturer knows about the problem. Bad representation in RSA

8425 2018-02-24 19:33:06 4. Your government is not coming for you, and all the guns you could legally own wouldn't stop the military from rolling a tank over your house. Which they wouldn't (unless you're a Native protesting an oil pipeline through sacred and sovereign lands). That's a paranoid mindset.

8427 2018-02-24 19:32:53 I used my Moroccan oil on her after i gave her a bath

But to be fair i got a big bottle for free and im the one that has to smell her all day
8428 2018-02-24 19:32:44 Interesting argument. Alternative thesis: higher interest rates choke off supply of capital to US E&Ps, curbing shale production and boosting oil prices

8430 2018-02-24 19:32:43 Brian Bavar, my car needs a oil change and a tune up. I could go get this don but I much rather my fam only touches my car sooooo.....
8431 2018-02-24 19:32:43 What did they do now?
8432 2018-02-24 19:32:35 What is better than bread with olive oil and balsamic , nothing that’s the answer! If u don’t know u don’t deserve to know.
8433 2018-02-24 19:32:25 Walmart should've known better than to give me 3 hours before my oil is changed. That's not spare time that's spree time. About to blow more money than I should. 
8434 2018-02-24 19:32:24 Why don't you use your influence to get your own oil bloc? Why so much hate on a woman who's blessed by God?
8435 2018-02-24 19:31:51 Walking in to get my oil change and getting told "Damn you got my dream car"
8436 2018-02-24 19:31:40 Can u plz tell from where i can get avocado oil?

8439 2018-02-24 19:31:20 Oil, gas, mining,aren’t stupid, they know where environmental oversight can be avoided. Third world countries without appropriate regulatory bodies and sometimes corrupted politicians.
8440 2018-02-24 19:31:14 1/ Interesting - thanks for the article! If I can add something, I would like to mention that Russian oil (Ural blend) has a density (around 30 API) that will be more and more precious since most of the recently developed US shale oil has an API >40
8441 2018-02-24 19:31:08 GAAN LOOK FOR WHO WILL GIVE YOU YOUR OWN OIL BLOC !! 
8442 2018-02-24 19:31:08 If you see something say something is utilized for a reason. However we don’t know until we try any avenue. I will admit that there are MANY industries donating to politicians that I’d like to see taken to task (pharmaceutical, oil, unions, etc.)
8443 2018-02-24 19:30:50 This is a test run using fixed variables and I need some oil, 5w30 will do.
8444 2018-02-24 19:30:47 In What Way, Aungie?
8445 2018-02-24 19:30:41 Wow, I didn’t have to wait 2 hours for an oil change. 
8446 2018-02-24 19:30:19 The bottom three are oil producers. What a shame.

8457 2018-02-24 19:28:36 Thank you for the well-informed tweet. He "groomed" her for that moment. Oil wells are hiring and Savage can become a roughneck and get maybe a pay increase. Is a real job that deplorable to him?

8465 2018-02-24 19:27:48 Davidson will be a top 6 defenseman is 2 years. Mark my words. Like what he did for the Oil
8466 2018-02-24 19:27:43 I’ve tried it... but like it doesn’t do anything. Am I supposed to do anything special with the tea tree oil?
8467 2018-02-24 19:27:33 he just explained that oil that comes from certain places have certain code names within the “industry” so I can see where you’re coming from

8476 2018-02-24 19:26:42 I feel ya. But id rather try and dissuade ppl from buying it in the first place bc promoting "sustainable palm oil" ignores the problem and might make ppl think they are doing good when they aren't. Like "free range eggs", people think it's so nice but it's not!
8477 2018-02-24 19:26:24 The Sons at our wellness camp this weekend will be sampling treatments such as iron lungs, Botox and cod liver oil.
8478 2018-02-24 19:26:23 I never said America's greedy included big oil, so thank you for clarifying. I guess these greedy corrupt monsters are little angels huh!
8479 2018-02-24 19:26:04 128g plain flour, 1 1/2 tbsps olive oil, generous pinch of salt, 100ml water. Make a dough. Split it into four balls, roll each one out on a floured surface. Run olive oil around a pan and then drain it, then fry until they look like tortilla!

8481 2018-02-24 19:25:57 I’ve recently started treating my anxiety with CBD oil (edibles) - it relaxes you without giving you the high that THC does. also @JustinMihaly swears by ashwaghanda (natural supp) and I just bought that!!! but haven’t started taking yet
8482 2018-02-24 19:25:51 What I can't understand is why doesn't Aziz just pay @JananHarb instead of paying upwards of £3000 p/h to lawyers?  It's not as if Aziz doesn't have the £12 Million #JananHarb is claiming. The time it's taken to write this tweet he's pumped out that much from a Riyadh oil well.
8483 2018-02-24 19:25:51 Well they learned that shitty movies still make money
8484 2018-02-24 19:25:48 ...I know.  I'm talking to the guy I replied to, who used pharma and oil as his point of comparison.
8485 2018-02-24 19:25:32 You mean like putting oil revenues into renewable power? ;-)

8490 2018-02-24 19:24:48 on the surface. But every time the islanders have come knocking, the oil end up bent over. History as a teacher
8491 2018-02-24 19:24:43 There still trying to crack oil production
8492 2018-02-24 19:24:42 There's a Que out there ready to pour Omega Oil down ya girls throat and call it the heart shaped herb while u stand there and watch
8493 2018-02-24 19:24:34 Oil fans seem fairly split on Davidson trade (not so much the return, just whether or not he should have been traded) & Isles fans seem kind of apathetic either way for *another* depth D.
8494 2018-02-24 19:24:25 Brahmins were flayed alive by sultans & were put inside boiling pot of oil, so much for Brahmanical Tyranny, 70% of all freedom fighters who died were Brahmins, & still we don't play victim card, quite unlike Dalits. It's time caste based reservations must go.
8495 2018-02-24 19:24:16 Good heist by the Oil....Davidson must be brimming with confidence!
8496 2018-02-24 19:24:16 Who here uses MCT oil? 

I have some thoughts and some questions!
8497 2018-02-24 19:24:16 ไม่ชิปก็ไม่ควรพูด
8498 2018-02-24 19:23:51 This guy is legit judging me for watching cartoons on the TV while my oil is getting changed. IDC.
8499 2018-02-24 19:23:50 Of course, if Gaffigan didn't intend it, he won't exactly deny it. Can't incite the mob.
8500 2018-02-24 19:23:49 I think you should check Manyo Factory, they have rosehip oil, serum, etc, I‘m planning to try their products soon. 
8501 2018-02-24 19:23:40 My phone just lasted at the gym for over an hour at 10%. u know when God made the oil in the lamp last 7 days and now they celebrate Hanukkah?? That’s kind of what it felt like
8502 2018-02-24 19:23:27 Terrorists? More like American and Russian money spilliting money and oil at the price of incorrect souls
8503 2018-02-24 19:23:26 She couldn't have been Nigerian richest Woman if not for Oil well,they shared national assets like family inheritance,wickedness
8504 2018-02-24 19:23:12 The only way to prevent more clearing than had already happened is to flatten or decrease demand; or for governments of countries that grow oil palms to cap allowances and prioritize conservation (a tough ask in growing economies).
8505 2018-02-24 19:22:57 i was suppose to get a oil change too. fuck it. everything cancelled for today. i just wanna chill & watch tv.

8507 2018-02-24 19:22:56 It's really incredible.
8508 2018-02-24 19:22:53 Baby oil works wonders for your skin
8509 2018-02-24 19:22:49 Most of my house is sick so we’re staying in and watching Loving Vincent, an oil painting animated feature film about Vincent Van Gogh 
8510 2018-02-24 19:22:36 They are - the whole meal is! The tortilla are plain flour, olive oil, water and salt!
8511 2018-02-24 19:22:27 So I'm wondering what's going on. Same social media company? Gaffigan isn't a conservative, but he's usually not openly and angrily political as far as I can tell. Certainly not to the point of open campaigning. He'd actually work it into a joke.
8512 2018-02-24 19:22:10 Listen listen I hear Congressional Wheels turning grab the oil can  and grease the axle.
8513 2018-02-24 19:22:05 Watercolour & oil pastel and more recently oil sticks allow me to attack paper usually in a square sketch book in a direct way. Marks come quickly, perhaps having taken years to form in my head. This is different from earlier figurative work that usually took a long time to make
8514 2018-02-24 19:21:51 Well you know what rose water is??? Well it’s literally the same thing but made into an oil! It’s sooooo goood for your skin!

8517 2018-02-24 19:21:21 Girl yes. I go to this place that makes literally every perfume scent into an oil and you can buy it by the bottle!! They last so long.
8518 2018-02-24 19:21:16 my mom abandoned me at walmart like i’m supposed to know what kind of oil/oil filter my car needs. then i ask for help and the dude calls me babe someone help me

8523 2018-02-24 19:20:48 4. Deliver all the production of oil and cocaine (marijuana we produce enough to export in USA). As an additional point web want you to attend, free of charge, our vicious "gringos" with  most pure cocaine and heroin.  Be done comply without qualms.
8524 2018-02-24 19:20:31 ！！確かにあれはすごく良かったです！お父さんが赤ちゃんをおんぶして…ってやつですよね。ゾンビものって前情報だけで見て不意打ちで感動した覚えがあります。そういえばカールじいさんの空飛ぶ家の冒頭4分くらいもショートムービーとして最高でした（本編もよかったけど）
8525 2018-02-24 19:20:30 This one fool asked how much oil did I have to put in it 
8526 2018-02-24 19:20:27 This is damn weird what are the us activities that cause radio active material your previous article mentioned oil are you proposing the us airforce built the island and ran away or are you asking for help to contain a natural phenomenon

8529 2018-02-24 19:20:04 Bro Osi, we have seen interviews times and times again.   She said it plainly ...... late Maryam played a big role in getting her the oil bloc.   So no be matter of ear-say or gossip. Maryam Babangida influenced how she got the ooo bloc.

8531 2018-02-24 19:20:02 well now
isn't this a day of
unexpected miracles:
I just placed
an opened bottle of
cooking oil
next to the sink while I
washed something
and actually
did not knock it down

#poem #kitchen #cooking #miracle #oil
8532 2018-02-24 19:19:52 I see that as well, but my assumption is, that the natural decline of 4-8% p.a. (estimated downside potential for OPEC 1.5-3 mbopd) will take effect this year, due to low investments since 2015 and that this cannot be balanced by US shale oil (estimated upside potential 1 mbopd)
8533 2018-02-24 19:19:52 Also: now you need to trash that cooking oil!

8541 2018-02-24 19:18:18 In most nations, governments have to contend with big corporations such as big banks or oil which you can kind of understand.  In the US, it’s primarily a fucking gun club.

8559 2018-02-24 19:14:28 @realDonaldTrump is the snake in snake oil. He has sold his venom masked as Make America Great Again and people wanting to believe in something better bought his sales pitch. Shame he is taking our wonderful country downhill. What is his legacy? Fear!

8567 2018-02-24 19:13:25 According to a case study, Nigeria's economy largely depends on oil and in the next two decades, its expected that about 80-95% of the Nigeria's oil will continuously be sold to the USA, and its ever ready at any moment to protect its oil supply from Nigeria.

Well, on a positive note, y'all can keep lowering the standards. You just might be lucky to hit crude oil.

8574 2018-02-24 19:12:07 Your computer uses candle light right now? And so does your heating system? And so do cars/buses/trains/planes you take? Stop using all that oil and Russia will stops producing it.
8575 2018-02-24 19:12:01 So the US is allowed to transport oil for the last 40+ years in the same area (without incident)...but BC is supposed to not allow a small increase in their shipping industry due to 'risk'...sure sounds fair...

I think big oil is going to destroy Mt. Rushmore next week.

8659 2018-02-24 19:02:56 1) It's only "backed" by a barrel of oil if you can trade 1 $PETRO for a barrel of oil. I highly doubt you will be able to do that for real. 

2) Seems like a money grab by the broke Venezuelan government.

3) I guarantee price manipulation shenanigans.

8662 2018-02-24 19:02:32 IMHO we should all hate Americans dying in regime change, oil theft wars. I've never been to Syria, Eva Bartlett & Vanessa Beeley have, repeatedly. I am not a journalist but I know that no respect-worthy journalist celebrates the silencing of other voices.

8665 2018-02-24 19:02:01 Anyone wanna pay for my oil change?
8666 2018-02-24 19:01:25 NRA's influence is outsized. There's no reason gun manufacturers should hold sway in a way Big Pharma, Big Insurance, Big Oil and Big Tobacco don't. Where is the money coming from? 
8667 2018-02-24 19:01:21 Fun Fact of the Day: The subsidence of above ground land due to the removal of oil in the Goose Creek Oil field once caused the only earthquake of local origin ever felt in the Houston Area. #TheMoreYouKnow

8671 2018-02-24 19:01:12 Sealioning at its best with every one of your replies.  You know darn well that there are other options than war. Putin has Trumps nuts in a vice.  He wouldn't even include Russia in the NK sanctions even though Putin delivered oil to Kim at sea.
8672 2018-02-24 19:00:56 Valid Prayer Point:
Lord, let my oil bloc locate me by faith. In Jesus Name. Amen.
8673 2018-02-24 19:00:32 I guess they like the one running the BIA as more oil and fracking even in Bishop Ca

8677 2018-02-24 19:00:19 A bit like our reliance on palm kernal residue for dairy feed. Ain't no such thing as sustainable palm oil or by-product I reckon.
8678 2018-02-24 19:00:14 Very cool Birthday! Hope nothing followed you home lol.....or do they have holy oil or a prayer you say on the way out?
8679 2018-02-24 19:00:11 For now on, available oil will get new homes � in other ways, such as using Myspace extensively.
8680 2018-02-24 19:00:09 There's money in war and controlling oil.
8681 2018-02-24 19:00:04 I been putting off getting my oil changed bc I simply hate waiting forever.
8682 2018-02-24 18:59:57 "See Jared, this part of the bus is the oil pan, this is the suspension, and -oh look it's the tailpipe!"
8683 2018-02-24 18:59:53 Eucalyptus oil smells so good and it's soothing af. I can't sleep unless I have it floating in the room.
8684 2018-02-24 18:59:46 Oil change was $57.  Done in 15 minutes though.  Happy enough.
8685 2018-02-24 18:59:45 Even a baby would have wanted an oil bloc...but Na God
8686 2018-02-24 18:59:44 Never tried roasting the spices like that, I’ve always zapped them on high heat for a few seconds in oil, I’ll give that a go.
8687 2018-02-24 18:59:35 Like, honestly ..... even the essential oil moments in the show... the breathing exercises.... I live
8688 2018-02-24 18:59:31 I’ve heard the coconut oil thing too actually. I find that rather interesting.
8689 2018-02-24 18:59:12 To tell how greedy this woman is, the oil block allocated to her was the generational patriomony of Ikubie, a community of Southern LGA in Bayelsa State. This woman has never drilled a single bole hole in that community and adjoining ones.
8690 2018-02-24 18:59:01 came to get my car inspected and an oil change, the guy doing it told me since I’m so beautiful he’s going to fix everything that’s been wrong with my car for free now. okayyyy lol
8691 2018-02-24 18:58:55 I have a theory that the oil company moved in and polluted Loot Lake because WHERE ARE ALL THE FISH?! More like POLUTE LAKE. And whyyyyyyyy is it soooo shallow?!
8692 2018-02-24 18:58:39 These crooks and liars today acclaimed to a slave name Nigeria is because of eastern oil & were defending killings because they are criminals who are lazy only depending on loots of ppl's wealth.Very soon Biafra is here and their throat will dry up including that Yoruba chameleon

8699 2018-02-24 18:57:45 They seem to follow him like the snake oil salesmen of the 1800s. Come to think of it, Trump talked about snakes and compared them to immigrants. Guess he should include himself and his wife. He is dividing our country by spreading his hate for others. God's speed to Mueller!
8700 2018-02-24 18:57:31 Drilling for oil is boring.
8701 2018-02-24 18:57:27 Olive oil will never betray your natural hair. NEVER.
8702 2018-02-24 18:57:25 Mexican politicians create conditions so mexican leave the country in search of better living, mexican politicians sell the country's goods #gold #silver #oil #copper #lithium #zinc #carbon etc in exchange of #fiatmoney(backed by faith) instead of tangible money.
8703 2018-02-24 18:57:11 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
8704 2018-02-24 18:56:52 Mmmm #fajitas for #tea! Nom nom. And nice and cheap too. Who needs a packet mix? Serves two: 1 tsp #hotchillipowder 2 tsp #cumin 2 tsp #smokedpaprika, #oil and #garlic for the mix. Just keep these in the cupboard and you'll save £'s!
8705 2018-02-24 18:56:37 I need an oil change so bad, but this wait is tragic. 
8706 2018-02-24 18:56:24 I just had boiling oil splash up into my eye how’s everyone else’s evening going
8707 2018-02-24 18:56:23 Well this is awkward! Manchester has always and will always be red no matter how much oil money is pumped into your club. Pun intended 
8708 2018-02-24 18:56:19 AND..if you get past all that nonsense and do end up buying some someday it is backed by the bolivar not the price of oil.. rant over 
8709 2018-02-24 18:56:06 Will That include American and Turkey?? And Will Syria still have the Right to Protect there Natural Resources?  I mean there Oil Fields
8710 2018-02-24 18:55:57 New batch of oil and no clue what to make today. Munchkins? Muffins?
8711 2018-02-24 18:55:57 Lord send me a man who knows how to change tires , oil and other essential stuff
8712 2018-02-24 18:55:55 Waiting in line to get an oil change. How come my oil change takes 10 minutes but everyone else's takes way longer?
8713 2018-02-24 18:55:53 How long ago did it sink?
Have you contacted the owner?
Why was it moved to the lock cut of all places, less than 50m from the lock.
The boat is polluting the river by means of the oil/fuel/waste tank.
8714 2018-02-24 18:55:50 That's a whole lot of  gab, and nothing in stone, or concrete. Cloth, 7 Churches,  Oil. Pastor ?

8720 2018-02-24 18:54:41 If Nigeria was any better and if people had access to a decent living or Alakija's oil bloc connect, nobody would be trying to leave the country at any chance they get. There has to be a working system for people to thrive in. Nigerians are not stupid and lazy.
8721 2018-02-24 18:54:17 Does anyone else consider it a failure by the Oil if they don’t weaponize their cap space to do something?
8722 2018-02-24 18:54:10 I am not a fan of government picking winners and losers.  I agree.  Let's the market and the consumer decide.  A la big oil vs renewable.    Renewable will win when it becomes efficient and economical enough for the masses.  Govt need not help either side.
8723 2018-02-24 18:54:03 On fire fuel oil hoy!!

8727 2018-02-24 18:53:27 Not much cheese wise in stores but you can make really good cheeses out of cashews and I make a queso dip out of steamed carrots, potatoes, nutritional yeast, a little oil/water, jalepeno, and vegan creams cheese. Throw in some salsa and bam! Stuff is addictive as hell.

On behalf of my grandma, and other poor farmers who lost their farmlands to oil pollution, and on behalf of my grandad, and other poor fishermen, who lost their livelihoods to polluted rivers, but still didn't want the oil block.

FUCK YOU!!!

8760 2018-02-24 18:49:09 This does support a strong push down. Oil pattern looks like consolidation but spx and dow patterns imo are more clear in that they will retest lows. For me this helps determine oils next move.

8775 2018-02-24 18:47:08 I'm pointing to actions. Like killing members of the Wagner Group who were threatening our Kerdish allies and their oil fields.

8777 2018-02-24 18:46:51 We're in a country of over 325 million people. No offense but logically speaking, 17 kids is a drop of oil in an ocean of water. You also avoided everything else I brought up but that's because you can't refute that.
8778 2018-02-24 18:46:45 This shooting and the lack of police response proves politics and policing are like oil and water.

8786 2018-02-24 18:46:04 Jurgen Klopp in a nutshell that. Its very very hard to compete against the oil but not impossible and he is doing it with more style and more passion.

8795 2018-02-24 18:44:40 Food for thought. The demise of the U.S.S.R. started with an unwinnable war in Afghanistan over a oil pipeline?
8796 2018-02-24 18:44:18 I woke up and my dad told me he got me an oil change, filled up my tank, got me a car wash, and Gil got me cfa... today’s going to be good 
8797 2018-02-24 18:44:08 Came for an oil changed.... ended up w/an oil change, filter change and some injection for my car ..
8798 2018-02-24 18:43:48 Mostly corruption... if resources were allocated so that in the north oil doesn't take precedence over access to water (that's in plenty but not a drop to drink) maybe...
8799 2018-02-24 18:43:48 Her only qualifications in getting an oil bloc was that she made clothes for babagindas wife....And besides the 12 year wait wasn’t her drilling for 12 years ....she had a case with the FG in court over the oil bloc so no exploration was going on

8810 2018-02-24 18:42:55 Thank God for tea tree oil
8811 2018-02-24 18:42:47 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
8812 2018-02-24 18:42:47 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
8813 2018-02-24 18:42:45 You forgot the reek of patchouli oil and marijuana 
8814 2018-02-24 18:42:42 First and foremost the US should clean it's own house first. Regime change for OIL and resources by the USA meddling in other countries elections via the CIA worldwide more than 80 times
8815 2018-02-24 18:42:09 chop up sweet potato
rub with just a teeny bit of oil and salt (just enough to enhance flavor)
put it over a heat source for a little while
eat it

cheap and easy and nutritious meal, you have literally no excuse
8816 2018-02-24 18:41:47 This exactly what happened to me in shema oil in kaduna.
8817 2018-02-24 18:41:44 Wow we have magic oil wells, only one fault Scotland won’t see much of the value of it, Westminster will rob us once again.
8818 2018-02-24 18:41:34 I become more and more antisocial by the second.. out of the 3 lunch plans I simultaneously made - I somehow ended up choosing getting an oil change and making my way to my fave Mexican spot to eat alone.
8819 2018-02-24 18:41:33 Time to give Scotland their independence and then invade them for their (our) oil. Fucking cheek of them beating us at the rugby.
8820 2018-02-24 18:41:18 Your MCM is in a truck club and all about trucks & cars but doesn’t know how to change his own oil lmfao
8821 2018-02-24 18:41:15 But with the wasted cap space this year, why not keep Eberle one more year?
8822 2018-02-24 18:41:11 @oil_shaeikh, we always dey together. But not this time because no one knows your candidate.
8823 2018-02-24 18:41:07 Surprise.  Surprise.
8824 2018-02-24 18:41:01 Now I'm wondering what Asari Dokubo's response to #Alakija's "I was gifted an oil bloc and I received it by faith" would be like. 
8825 2018-02-24 18:40:54 #UnrigtheSystem goes deeper than the NRA. This applies to health care, education, oil/renewable energy, banks, wall street, housing, and internet service provider consumer protections.  By the way, consumer protections means regulations. #TeamMissouri!
8826 2018-02-24 18:40:48 heat up the pan before you put oil in it. That way you can get the pan as hot as possible without the oil burning.

8828 2018-02-24 18:40:46 every day 45 lies, a member of congress dies a slow emotional death
8829 2018-02-24 18:40:36 Because that's what we do with resources, whether it's oil, natural gas, coal, lumber, fish, wheat, diamonds, uranium...
8830 2018-02-24 18:40:30 I love titles that have punctuation, especially exclamation marks. Things like:
Goethe!
Mother!
Oil!

Question marks are also nice, though the enjoyment is slightly impeded by the fact that they are actually necessary. Colons or dashes... meh... tahe it or leave it.
8831 2018-02-24 18:40:26 Almost 30.  Since Affinitak (their lung cancer drug). The company IPOed at $10, 30 plus years ago.  $IONS CEO quite a snake oil salesman.

8834 2018-02-24 18:40:19 Syria "not targeting civilians" nah, targets just happen to be amongst civilians #c4news ironic that Syria use the Likud defence, while their oil fields in the Golan are being plundered

8836 2018-02-24 18:40:03 - Take the oil.
- Bomb the s*** out of cities under siege.
- Torture detainees.
- Police shouldn't be too nice.
- Opioid addicts shouldn't have started in the first place.
- Arm schoolteachers.

Any idea this man has to fix a problem is the exact opposite of helpful. #SucksAtJob
8837 2018-02-24 18:39:51 @hildzer I wish we knew about Oil drama like this
8838 2018-02-24 18:39:40 Design ssentials, hicks, argan oil, olive oil and murrays are all trash. Need new recommendations 
8839 2018-02-24 18:39:39 Sniff on a rag or put in hot water peppermint oil and eucalyptus 
Or try cold and sinus Advil or panadol
Or dilute sum salt in hot water and put it up through your nose. To flush your sinuses 
*For best results, do all at the same time. *
8840 2018-02-24 18:39:35 I totally agree with you. My personal research, study, observation clearly indicates that discontinuing the consumption of oil in our food can drastically cut down the risk of cancers and other degenerative disorders.
8841 2018-02-24 18:39:35 cbd oil: placebo effect is real but this is too expensive for placebo effect
8842 2018-02-24 18:39:33 RT @Murfboro: Shop owner speaks out after 23 businesses were padlocked for CBD oil. Meanwhile how many people died from opioids.
8843 2018-02-24 18:39:31 We’re gonna need a lot more salt
8844 2018-02-24 18:39:26 My point is you can’t say in owning an oil bloc there’s a chance there’s no oil in it. Well she was smart I’m not fully selling of her bloc like others . But even tho she wanted to sell it off she would have still made a fortune from it. There’s no faith here, she’s like them
8845 2018-02-24 18:39:12 The new oil!
8846 2018-02-24 18:39:05 Munyes is a decoy for the Turkana so that the sharks can siphon the oil without accountability. That’s how you play with the intelligence of nomadic pastoralist.
8847 2018-02-24 18:39:00 Labours TPP is simply luring the Business Vote=The benefits to NZ in 2030 is FA=While allowing Foreign Corporate control of NZ people and Resources like Oil,Coal and other Planet Polluting Money Makers.
8848 2018-02-24 18:38:51 As a COMBAT Vietnam Veteran it's only COMMON SENSE to not sell AR15's to Teenagers. The NRA is selling lies and Snake oil and I have ZERO respect for its Political motivrations to control pur Society. The NRA is a Dinosaur in 2018. Extinct....
8849 2018-02-24 18:38:49 She's thinking of olive oil... 
8850 2018-02-24 18:38:45 So the ND can't lay claim to it because it's that far out? (Honest question not trolling)

How far out can a region or state claim an offshore oil well?
8851 2018-02-24 18:38:26 I accidentally put my coconut oil in the refrigerator with my food 
8852 2018-02-24 18:38:24 Went to @Target for flour and baking powder, left with those items plus ear buds, olive oil, notebooks and you know, everything Target subliminally let me know I needed.
8853 2018-02-24 18:38:16 Kansas, Auburn, Arizona, 194
8854 2018-02-24 18:38:04 As the title of the book it's adapted from says, it's about : "OIL!" (The exclamation point is my favourite part about this.)
8855 2018-02-24 18:38:03 OIL OF SUE ME DNDHUDKSKSHD
8856 2018-02-24 18:38:00 I don't really use palm oil,
I eat very little processed food 

Fresh fruits and vegetables, buy fresh meat and cook it myself 
What little oil I use is corn oil
8857 2018-02-24 18:37:54 Went to Dodge because I have free oil changes and still paid $175 for a bunch of bullshit  like I’m just done for the day I can’t
8858 2018-02-24 18:37:44 It's always been about the return & when to do it. The moment Oilers had McDavid fall into their lap, at least 2 of Eberle, Hall & RNH were going to be moved...that was never in question.
8859 2018-02-24 18:37:30 Disgusting. This acceptable but pipelining oil is condemned??
8860 2018-02-24 18:37:10 OH ok there is one difference this time. I used vegetable oil bc I was out of schmaltz! I always make schmaltz and yesterday I couldn’t.
8861 2018-02-24 18:37:10 Just like California-Gavin Newsom's aunt is Nancy Pelosi, Dianne Feinstein godmother, appointed by Willie Brown, John Burton, Getty (oil).
8862 2018-02-24 18:37:08 They're waiting on someone to give them a script to do it
8863 2018-02-24 18:36:53 "The only thing tame about me..is my edges" im hollering at this olive oil commercial
8864 2018-02-24 18:36:50 OIL AND GAS FRACKING & AND MINING ..... ROADS .....IS DESTROYING THIS.....
8865 2018-02-24 18:36:40 Well, technically, at level 20 there's an "upgrade" for the Bunker, but I think it's more for your team rather than Blaze.

Drop the Bunker, have someone pop in while your oil spill is on cool down, toss the oil from inside the Bunker, & Blaze will ignite the oil spills.
8866 2018-02-24 18:36:21 I get it that, what would you have replaced oil with? It's used in everything, including hybrid vehicle's, there isn't thing that can replace it. super cheap to use
8867 2018-02-24 18:36:18 I still don't understand why an oil well should be allocated to one person when each state can just simply own one... And its revenues be used for developmental projects and settle state workers salaries every month.
8868 2018-02-24 18:36:14 Oil be damned!
8869 2018-02-24 18:36:14 Red and always red. Man Shitty have relied on oil money for titles and are still a long way off United's record
8870 2018-02-24 18:36:14 getting an oil change and the man slipped and grabbed the desk as if his life depended on it... and then I couldn’t help but laugh silently 
8871 2018-02-24 18:35:52 I... may have driven over an oil pot and singed my horse.
8872 2018-02-24 18:35:40 Not even coconut oil?
8873 2018-02-24 18:35:21 And not an ounce of "clean" coal, oil or natural gas required.
8874 2018-02-24 18:35:11 Hey, can I have some oil, dis bitch is thirsty

8877 2018-02-24 18:35:00 After reading Oil and Honey, @billmckibben is inspiring me to go to jail
8878 2018-02-24 18:34:58 She failed to mention that her primary concern is to allow the oil and gas industry to increase their profits by keeping GPT as low as possible...while continuing to cut educational spending along with other critical services the state should provide
8879 2018-02-24 18:34:55 finally getting my oil changed today & break done tmrw 
8880 2018-02-24 18:34:51 What is regular olive oil . Here we get either Evoo or olive oil combined with some other veg oil

8882 2018-02-24 18:34:28 So I've heard. Let's just be optimistic he comes up with a good portfolio and attends debates
8883 2018-02-24 18:34:17 I’m finna drink strictly regular crown from now till the oil spill
8884 2018-02-24 18:34:12 Michelle it does work. Even cracking open a bottle of lavender essential oil and taking a big sniff will help. Let me know how it works for you.
8885 2018-02-24 18:34:06 I can’t wait for y’all to come out the house with all the coconut oil inside 285 on, sundresses and white toes.
8886 2018-02-24 18:34:00 Scotland might have the Kolkata Cup but we have their oil.
8887 2018-02-24 18:33:45 I’ll watch this once I’m done with my oil change , you never disappoint with these videos
8888 2018-02-24 18:33:34 Can i just let my car blowup instead of waiting 3 years for an oil change
8889 2018-02-24 18:33:33 U know that movie girl! My fave is Last Xmas. Girl found out her hubby was cheating. Drove his car over a cliff, poured baby oil on theloor while he was showering,when he ran he slipped bitch beat his ass with a belt
 My bf looked at me and scooted over.

8894 2018-02-24 18:32:46 But I don't buy tuna sandwiches where I buy my motor oil.....I might be misquoting but I think I'm pretty close LOL
8895 2018-02-24 18:32:43 It would make for a tense scene during their totally unscripted shared planning sessions in the makeup room.
8896 2018-02-24 18:32:43 Extra virgin/cold pressed olive oil not good to heat. Best eaten in salads etc. Regular olive oil you can heat coz smoking pt is higher. In general for frying use higher smoking point oils/fats.
8897 2018-02-24 18:32:40 Rental car biz is a 
8898 2018-02-24 18:32:26 "BP, bringing oil to US shores."

8903 2018-02-24 18:31:17 Transformation
 •Grapes must be crushed to make wine  
•Diamonds form under pressure  
•Olives are pressed to release oil  
•Seeds grow in darkness 
 Whenever you feel crushed, under pressure, pressed, or in darkness, you’re in a powerful place of transformation

8909 2018-02-24 18:30:40 Our region (Middle East/Turkey) is once again sought to be sacrificed for certain powers' fight for profit and interest as it was a century ago. The borders of our region is tried to be redrawn with blood and tear by the imperialists sniffing out oil.**+rich lithium etc.
8910 2018-02-24 18:30:39 y’all try using baby oil next time you fuck lmao it’s sound whack but just massage shorty & oil her up watch how that shit go.

8921 2018-02-24 18:29:59 I need a gram of some fine oil
8922 2018-02-24 18:29:56 I wish you know how lucrative the oil palm indulstry is.

8924 2018-02-24 18:29:36 Best spot to get ya brakes and oil change will always be the local autozone lol
8925 2018-02-24 18:29:30 Please, don’t even reply to this little sh*t.
(Pssst...he was a little sh*t before the shooting too; see his pre-2/14 tweets)
Only difference now is he has a blue checkmark.
He certainly hasn’t become a better person just because he got shot at
8926 2018-02-24 18:29:08 Gas/oil pipes
8927 2018-02-24 18:29:02 Those oil mines though.
8928 2018-02-24 18:28:56 Olive oil or coconut oil. Slather generously on feet, wrap feet in plastic wrap (or plastic bags),put on socks over bags, put feet up and let it soak in. Also works for hair. Dampen hair,add oil,wrap,wait,rinse.
8929 2018-02-24 18:28:45 Man I got an oil change last month, idk why my car oil light is on but I’m blew.

8933 2018-02-24 18:28:19 Dude tried selling me a truck while I'm here getting my oil changed and his sell pitch was "you're driving a 2017 with 15,000 miles, why not drive a 2018, with 0 miles for 100 dollars more a month?" I told him, because I don't want to pay 994.55 a month, but thanks.

8948 2018-02-24 18:26:00 The wage gap between men & women is #FakeNews 

Because women don't work a lot of high paying jobs that men do--whether it's in Silicon Valley or a more dangerous job like working an oil rig or trucking (which pay well).  

So it's stupid to have that statistic
8949 2018-02-24 18:25:59 Clove oil is good for alleviating tooth pain, even exposed roots. I learned that from Marathon Man, no joke.
8950 2018-02-24 18:25:45 Mmmm this sour tangie oil tastes like Sour Patch Kids #yummy
8951 2018-02-24 18:25:29 Christ... Is this a serious question? Chevron and co (established oil companies with years of expertise and proven track records) Vs a tailor... Guy..
8952 2018-02-24 18:25:18 okay I could rub scented oil on it?

8958 2018-02-24 18:24:37 So, guns can move by themselves, it doesn't take a person to make them work? I bet cars drink beer right, instead gas or oil, you fill it up with Budweiser before it drives away itself. You have the intelligence of a two year old, seriously.
8959 2018-02-24 18:24:32 Yep. DC and me are oil and water.
8960 2018-02-24 18:24:29 I doubt a company such as Exxon (oil and gas corporation) cares that much about saving paper. Just sayin'
8961 2018-02-24 18:24:19 taking my car in for an oil change and they said its gonna be an hour and a half lmao
8962 2018-02-24 18:23:54 Giving oil blocks to individuals is the biggest injustice to oil communities and regions ...especially to people outside our region
8963 2018-02-24 18:23:37 Hahaha hindi ako ma-cleansing oil beh  mas masaya ako sa balm hahaha

8966 2018-02-24 18:23:25 What’s wrong with coconut oil ? When I can get a whole jar for $4 lol
8967 2018-02-24 18:23:21 Liars. Courtesy of the GOP and their oil and coal corporate overlords, collectively also known as the Walking Dead
8968 2018-02-24 18:23:18 Zero tolerance for oil! Transition to zero oil use is the ONLY responsible way forward.
8969 2018-02-24 18:23:18 The big fat joke that's called KRG is the definition of corruption and nepotism and the entire world know that. Who sell its oil for 10 years in advance and cash the check?! You think you are smart and playing all side but you are only playing yourselves.
8970 2018-02-24 18:23:15 That’s what hostile entities do. People don’t realize our next civil war has already begun
8971 2018-02-24 18:22:52 forewarning this is gross and abt my ear health
man i just hate it when i cant fuckgin HEAR! i sneezed and my ears popped and if i complain my parents will tell me to put oil in and i would honest to god rather die than put that in my ears ever again when the doctors cant FIX IT!
8972 2018-02-24 18:22:48 Oil demand is increasing globally. USA production will grow but not at the levels predicted by the EIA/IEA. Already seeing missed guidance in the USA (Devon, Apache to name the most recent examples).  We are going on $75 wti by year end.  Yes
8973 2018-02-24 18:22:43 @jennakimjones - want to make banana bread but don't have applesauce. Can I exclude or substitute oil? Not a #askjenna - need help now! 
8974 2018-02-24 18:22:33 As a former Beetle owner it’s not the big things I’d be afraid of, it’s a million tiny things like window switches inexplicably breaking and going through o2 sensors like oil changes
8975 2018-02-24 18:22:21 I FEEL MY ANXIETY STARTING TO KICK IN AND I DON'T HAVE ANY CBD OIL. AH!
8976 2018-02-24 18:22:08 I was talking about the oil deals and Ross connection. Not coincidental that Manafort went to a firm where he had connections for the report
8977 2018-02-24 18:21:51 It's a sad day when #mannys has no #potatosalad.
8978 2018-02-24 18:21:49 Nhai asi Harare East yava bema diamonds here or oil.Why Harare East not Uzumba or Mzarabani or Mt Darwin?
8979 2018-02-24 18:21:43 When you realise you have near no oil left n need to turn your heating off - just in time for it to be the coldest few days ever!! 
8980 2018-02-24 18:21:41 حتى انت يا محمود هههههههههههههههههه
8981 2018-02-24 18:21:34 My own pain in this whole gist is that I don’t have friends who can just dash me an oil bloc just because.
8982 2018-02-24 18:21:25 THC can be made into an oil. Use in a capsule from Whole Foods or Vitamin Cottage. Only a rice grain size blob will work. It’s gotta be dosed on a person to person basis as to achieve effectiveness without being shit faced. Or up the dose to achieve the latter. But some swear by
8983 2018-02-24 18:21:23 Rep John Boozman (R-AR) accepted $18,200 from Murphy Oil. He votes with his party 99.17% of the time.

8986 2018-02-24 18:20:11 Took a shower, massages my face, did a Mayan abdominal massage with my cramping oil, put on eyeliner my hair came out perfectly curled today on top of this weather. I feel like a new woman!
8987 2018-02-24 18:20:11 I've driven to and from Macon 5 times this week  need a oil change. rotation and balance and some gas 
8988 2018-02-24 18:20:08 Imagine the oil block allocated to her by the self proclaimed owner of Nigeria and letter writer Obasanjo
8989 2018-02-24 18:19:56 castor oil works if you do it consistently
8990 2018-02-24 18:19:56 プレステのダウンロードするやつかんたん決済できるやん
8991 2018-02-24 18:19:38 Some people are actually so daft that I don't understand how they even have a platform. Anyway I have personal issues I don't have time to argue about oil blocs and who deserves them.
8992 2018-02-24 18:19:34 This is a step in the right direction. The cost analysis should be done on rail v pipelines; if they float you can still pipeline them in water. You would also have to ship the light oil byproduct. There's still the initial problem of extracting it without devastating the area.
8993 2018-02-24 18:19:34 Add oil to the vat. It’ll stop beeping
8994 2018-02-24 18:19:16 beard oil

8998 2018-02-24 18:18:56 You Got That Right

But if you look closely to what he ACTUALLY DOES you will notice that HE doesn’t really care about them either! 

He is a very good Snake Oil Salesman however!
8999 2018-02-24 18:18:55 Tbis coconut oil working miracles
9000 2018-02-24 18:18:38 Hear nuh all yuh the man reach with he oxtail and ask if I want a oil dong?  yaaas Sir YAAAS. I am eating all  the  food  
9001 2018-02-24 18:18:35 It's good and all but oil bloc isn't supposed to be an advantage given to an individual... No be her fault sha, na Naija.. If they give me I go collect too
9002 2018-02-24 18:18:32 i can smell tea tree oil and i dont know where its coming from but it also smells like lavender and now im sleepyu
9003 2018-02-24 18:18:23 Got coconut oil on my shorts 
9004 2018-02-24 18:18:20 listen trudeau had the potential to be amazing, but he’s not. he’s done nothing for our economy and it’s going south real fast after harper. he wanted to cut oil sands in alberta? that’s one of our main incomes? he’s good socially, but that’s all.
9005 2018-02-24 18:18:11 Think of how much dirt & oil builds up on makeup brushes after each use. Wash them with a brush cleaner often.
9006 2018-02-24 18:17:55 Lmao. Guy have you done your own research on how she got her oil bloc? Don't come here and pontificate when people are legitimately upset about how one person cornered off a significant part of our common wealth via nepotism. Tomorrow you'll be here complaining about Nigeria.
9007 2018-02-24 18:17:54 4-ACO-DMT and CBD Oil are good too.
9008 2018-02-24 18:17:54 This new coconut oil smells like cupcakes 
9009 2018-02-24 18:17:52 Please who has oil block that they're not using. I will accept it by faith.

Doesn't have to be actively producing please.

Oil block ti di souvenir that they share at parties. Like 'thank you for coming, here's an oil block, e ma binu pe o kere'.
9010 2018-02-24 18:17:47 We're doing olive oil samples today which I haven't done before and my boss needs to bring me bread and show me how she wants everything set up
9011 2018-02-24 18:17:43 warm melted shea butter & tea tree oil on a freshly waxed or shaved body –

a self-care luxury.


9012 2018-02-24 18:17:42 The cultist mustn’t go against The Cult.
9013 2018-02-24 18:17:34 He didn't specify the type of oil @MuhdLawali e fit be palm oil oh
9014 2018-02-24 18:17:03 Couldn't agree more MEGA MEGA disapointment and to only use oil instead of a actual chilli is a piss take..
9015 2018-02-24 18:16:55 The God that gave Folorunsho Alakija Oil bloc by Faith will definitely give me America VISA by Faith too  Insha’Allah
9016 2018-02-24 18:16:48 I am gyessing the Cyprians found #oil reserves and the seagulls are all over it? 
9017 2018-02-24 18:16:45 You said there was one policy enumerated. I pointed out that was false. You're pushing the trope, that's often trotted out on Fox, that unions are "corrupt" and serve no purpose. That, in fact, is bullshit. From oil & gas to teachers, unions protect workers & provide leverage.
9018 2018-02-24 18:16:37 Mine use a cup of vegetable oil
9019 2018-02-24 18:16:22 It's the raw meat handling, then picking up bottles of oil, salt & pepper etc....then a quick rinse and then they go and chop up salad!   Makes me wonder what they do behind closed doors in their restaurants.
9020 2018-02-24 18:16:20 Most #Oil and #Gas companies rely on paper-based systems to keep track of products. Get ahead of the game, save time with Infochip.
9021 2018-02-24 18:16:17 Went to gym and got a oil change before 11  now time for a fresh fade
9022 2018-02-24 18:16:08 Buy centronella oil. Once you apply yam, dem no gree near you.
9023 2018-02-24 18:16:01 A car actually plowed into an oil tanker outside my house a litlle while ago and um... No explosion! THE ACTION MOVIES LIED
9024 2018-02-24 18:15:52 my dad not only took my car to get its oil changed and the tires rotated this morning, he brought it back with a full tank of gas in it. #blessed
9025 2018-02-24 18:15:51 The last time I saw him, he smelt *so* good too. He’d used some herbal massage oil that’s super good for muscle pain that’s been one of my favourite scents for years so yeah that was pretty great.
9026 2018-02-24 18:15:34 Agora na Melody 94.1: MIDNIGHT OIL - BEDS ARE BURNING
9027 2018-02-24 18:15:19 Goes in for an oil change and they mess up my suspension and blame it on me! The audacity!!!! @pepboysauto  shameful service.
9028 2018-02-24 18:15:11 That's why it's so great that President Trump would put himself out there and take on the challenge. We elected him to #UnrigTheSystem which benefits only the wealthy. Washington is owned by big business, big pharma, big industry, big oil - all the lobbies. Not Trump. #MAGA
9029 2018-02-24 18:14:21 And they wonder why we don’t trust them.
9030 2018-02-24 18:14:19 Dude... this isn’t true
9031 2018-02-24 18:14:16 @Battlefield Can someone there please explain how its a Major defeat to lose on the last Sector on the last map of Oil of Empires....come on guys you need to rethink your scoring multiplier just a little. Maybe X1.5 at least depending how far you got but to nothing SMH...
9032 2018-02-24 18:14:02 Its her fault she never learnt the code of conduct for oil billionaires. 

You cannot afford to be famous. Its their cross. 

But she wants to have it all.
9033 2018-02-24 18:13:50 Iraq is an itty bitty country compared to Russia and China. It's also in the Middle East. The neocons wanted Iraq's oil.
9034 2018-02-24 18:13:47 I need somebody to grease/oil my scalp
9035 2018-02-24 18:13:42 “Shit so new they didn’t know what to call it, all they saw was a 2 door & it came with a spoiler the dealer want $1200 to change the oil” 

- @CurrenSy_Spitta
9036 2018-02-24 18:13:34 I really hope I’m in and out of Honda for my oil change
9037 2018-02-24 18:13:34 ฝันดีนะคะ @iam_Oil
9038 2018-02-24 18:13:22 Went and got my oil changed last night. Dude asked if I wanted my wipers replaced. I said sure. Until he said they were $25.99 a piece. I politely renigged because cheap.
9039 2018-02-24 18:12:58 When the noisy computer fan isn't from dust or bearings but the cold-snap bringing fan blades and case grill together. Keep the air and oil, it's all quiet on the ventilation front thanks to Mr Screwdriver.
9040 2018-02-24 18:12:56 why would anyone think that it would be redeemable thru oil. idea was always that it's linked to the price of a barrel. them redeeming it in their own currency makes sense, they are trying to stimulate their economy thru crypto. ima buy some.
9041 2018-02-24 18:12:50 Gone ott with the carrot oil my arse is the colour of a tomato 
9042 2018-02-24 18:12:43 Ever watch that Cold War film (TV) about tbe Soviet Spetsnaz sabotage & invasion of Alaskan oil pipeline? David Soul was in it? I think it was 1982 or 1983?
9043 2018-02-24 18:12:34 update he is now buy an essential oil diffuser
9044 2018-02-24 18:12:14 Wow, interesting conundrum! Also from the point of view of oil vs. renewable energies 
9045 2018-02-24 18:12:14 How about climate. I study +work in the sector and I sometimes here from less informed people that scientists could have been bought to invent the human made climate change. But if any lobby has the power and money to buy ppl, it would be the crude oil lobby.
9046 2018-02-24 18:12:09 فين هوا 
9047 2018-02-24 18:12:08 Coconut oil seems to be a fave

9050 2018-02-24 18:11:59 Need for hemp fiber paper, oil could create a new agricultural market for wy Farmers #codytownhall
9051 2018-02-24 18:11:56 I feel like people should spam send audio from the columbine shooting in 1999 to any congressman associated with the NRA or who refuses to establish gun regulations. Just to let them know how fucking terrifying it is.
9052 2018-02-24 18:11:54 Rolled a 2g wood then took care of my car. A quick oil change, some gas, now the car wash...
9053 2018-02-24 18:11:17 Tomorrow, Moos Canoes will be out (Sunday 25th) to help clean up some of the oil spill. Contact them for more details. On Monday 26th, there's a clean up event from 10:00–14:00 around the Lea Bridge Weir. All protective equipment will be provided.
9054 2018-02-24 18:11:09 Used powder this time. I think next time I’ll add cream to make it saucier. Mushroom mixture was diced and tossed prior to, and baked all at once. Fresh basil, scallions, minced garlic, salt, pepper, olive oil. Very healthy meal.
9055 2018-02-24 18:10:51 Ort. Wait till the oil drilling begins. #zeinkesucks #trumpsucks
9056 2018-02-24 18:10:48 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
9057 2018-02-24 18:10:47 However bad the #Oilers are in their current state of play, management & ownership at least they aren't the #Senators! #OttawaSenatorsAreActingLikeTheirGovernmentalCounterparts #PeterChiarelli #Oil #McDavid #Karlsson #ErikKarlsson #FallinForDahlin #EugeneMelnyk #DarylKatz #Dahlin
9058 2018-02-24 18:10:46 Then try the Jamaican oil, and visit @BeautyonTApp for hair products that will help heal the scalp and promote hair growth 

and no braiding
9059 2018-02-24 18:10:28 Okay I just saw the tweet where she said she got the oil block by faith 
9060 2018-02-24 18:10:23 It's all like selling snake oil - or a political candidate
9061 2018-02-24 18:10:19 G there is no way to prop this up more than what it is.

It takes more skills to mess up and not make a fortune off an oil bloc you got as a “gift”. This is not a Dangote or a Mike Adenuga story. She should let us rest and not force faux-inspiration abeg.
9062 2018-02-24 18:10:16 I’ve come to a conclusion. @frankiecooks has an Olive oil obsession.
9063 2018-02-24 18:10:08 二重顎っていうか逆に顎がないよ。
9064 2018-02-24 18:10:06 She sounds more like an exxon mobile mouthpiece. It's fine to mow down indonesia bc there's palm oil there???
9065 2018-02-24 18:10:01 Imagine that the same person is tweeting about Alakija getting oil block from Abacha? This world is a wonderful place.

Oil, charcoal on paper
9067 2018-02-24 18:09:50 How about we do the conservative thing and leave it in the ground. We let the rest of the world waste it's oil while we conserve ours. While we do that we develope renewable for ourselves. Then we the rest of the world is out we sell it at hyper inflated prices.
9068 2018-02-24 18:09:33 I remember my new Daisy Red Ryder BB gun with ominous mounted scope on the 50’s. It gave me tactile pleasure to hold it, it looked great, the sound it produced was intoxicating. I still remember its pleasant fragrance of gun oil. Had to be there, Lefties.
9069 2018-02-24 18:09:15 I miss those 5 quart $29.99 oil changes.
9070 2018-02-24 18:08:44 Yeah i do use lubricant or baby oil
9071 2018-02-24 18:08:43 Sent! Also worth trying: (purified) bicarbonate soda, a Zapper, oregano oil, medical grade cannabis.
9072 2018-02-24 18:08:33 Guess i touched a raw nerve. Sorry. Trace back your way to a man. What man judges God has already judged!
9073 2018-02-24 18:08:21 I bet they don,t remember what they have done  or remember Iraq only when it comes to  oil and dividing  shares
9074 2018-02-24 18:08:11 This year elections are critical and vital then so many years ago. We will need to transform our economy & reduce our dependence on oil.  Transform #bcci to serve its members and help them cope with the major global transformational forces affecting the global economy.
9075 2018-02-24 18:08:01 Y’all dragging Alakija ..like does it matter who gets what oil block . All I know is I got a scholarship frm her years back..@alakijaofficial Thankyou ma!!
9076 2018-02-24 18:07:53 Bugles. Corn, coconut oil, salt and sugar. And a serving size is 1 1/3 cups! Pure #win. Only issue with them is I can no longer fit them on my fingers as finger hats.
9077 2018-02-24 18:07:52 Acne scars, discolouration/pigmentation facial mask from the motherland:

Lemon + yogurt + graham flour + olive oil + turmeric = Ubtan

You're welcome brown-skinned beautiesss
9078 2018-02-24 18:07:48 The nigga behind me just yelled “girl bring yo sexy ass here and let me oil them ashy ass ankles”
9079 2018-02-24 18:07:41 Just because they have industry doesn’t mean the business owners live there. I live near oil and no rich people live near the factories.
9080 2018-02-24 18:07:41 THC or oil suppositories may absorb more readily that way. A lot of cancer patients use RSO that way. Cocaine users used to do “poop chute toots” because the way our bodies absorb things delivered that way.
9081 2018-02-24 18:07:28 “Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
’Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.

Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I'll rise.”

Maya Angelou
9082 2018-02-24 18:06:58 That might interfere with their narrative and their 15 minutes.
9083 2018-02-24 18:06:27 I'd make billions with no degree and an oil bloc.
9084 2018-02-24 18:06:27 No you somewhat know me I would have said it but maybe just some conditioner to get rid of that bed head look or a brush maybe some coconut oil 
9085 2018-02-24 18:06:26 Nigerians who always feel entitled are criticizing Madam Alakija because of her oil block. 
Go and see how custom heads in Nigeria dash people's containers to friends and family anyhow. 

If you know the right people, and ask nicely, you'd get favours.
9086 2018-02-24 18:06:23 鍋を焼いてるんやでぴんちゃん！
9087 2018-02-24 18:05:53 Lol Folorunsho Alakija said nobody wanted an oil bloc and that they took it by faith. My bludclart country!
9088 2018-02-24 18:05:39 My car is at the dealership getting an oil change and brake maintenance. I feel so vulnerable.  

What if I need to make a getaway quick?
9089 2018-02-24 18:05:38 Sweet oil you can get at Walgreens,. warm it up and put in you ear

9091 2018-02-24 18:05:28 Im so happy we got our car fixed  now all we need is an oil change and we'll be good 
9092 2018-02-24 18:05:24 Definitely cooking the basics, how to put fuel, oil and water in a car AND to hang washing up properly so they don’t have to iron everything.
9093 2018-02-24 18:05:24 have you been?
9094 2018-02-24 18:05:17 4not just oil but complete rule over humanity a western return to slave trade

9096 2018-02-24 18:04:38 Got my first oil change.
Now I don’t even want to drive my truck no more lol
9097 2018-02-24 18:04:36 You forgot: the right for LGBTQ to adopt children, the right for low income to have healthcare and for their children to have free breakfast and lunch at school, the right to have land free of oil fields, the right to have an honest POTUS.......
9098 2018-02-24 18:04:31 And with sweet oil
costly
you anointed yourself

and on a soft bed
delicate
you would let loose your longing
9099 2018-02-24 18:04:27 Burning the midnight oil for the hundredth time 
9100 2018-02-24 18:04:07 So last night I did a hot oil treatment on my scalp and roots with a deep condition on my follicles.. woo my hair is shiny, wavy and soft
9101 2018-02-24 18:03:44 One outfit, maybe, but he had a whole wardrobe of ceremonial Indian wear like a cosplay character.  How’d you feel if Modi came to Canada dressed as, first a Mountie, then a lumberjack, a native, then dressed in Newfoundland sou’wester and oil slicks? All paid by tax dollars.
9102 2018-02-24 18:03:38 Looks like the airlines and car rental companies all hate me so I will have to drive on all of my trips. You know what that means? More money for Big Oil! You should have banned them first.
9103 2018-02-24 18:03:36 I figured I'd make it lavender. I got a 4oz bottle of lavender oil. Poured the whole thing in the mixer. It smelled...... Meh. Then I poured in rose water I use to make shortbread. Still too...... acidy.. then I poured in this vanilla/musk aroma oil I had from  long time ago
9104 2018-02-24 18:03:14 Hey @ChickfilA - there are lots of oil choices. Why use #peanut oil when so many kids have severe peanut #allergies?
9105 2018-02-24 18:03:07 I find the whole thing really fascinating. And in a way it’s kind of a lesson that money isn’t everything in life. That said, I won’t mind an oil block
9106 2018-02-24 18:02:57 He is - the neem oil is working wonders - just got to keep his fur out of his dinner now ! 
9107 2018-02-24 18:02:41 Yes and that was through nepotism. Even an idiot can make billions if handed over an oil block she does not deserve
9108 2018-02-24 18:02:40 @ProteasDJ  beds are burning midnight oil
9109 2018-02-24 18:02:36 Boss gaya oil lene
9110 2018-02-24 18:02:34 Sana may tingi ng mga facial products no?
Feel ko yung recent breakout ko dahil sa cleansing oil. Kaso jusko sobrang mahal di ko naman pwede ipangluto nalang diba. Haha
9111 2018-02-24 18:02:32 Try Jamaican Castor Oil

And Ungaluki , whilst it’s growing
9112 2018-02-24 18:02:27 Tame tension headaches by rubbing peppermint oil, or white flower oil into your temples. #healthcoach #healthtips #essentialoils
9113 2018-02-24 18:02:24 If he was coming to our house when I was wee my Gran would put those wee covers on the back of the chairs for the hair oil. Not sure what she'd do if Tom was visiting, mind.
9114 2018-02-24 18:02:16 I think the difference is being successful without being famous. I met some serious douchebag oil barons in Texas. Money without fame is dif than money and fame, I guess.

9117 2018-02-24 18:01:51 Traffic, pollution, climate change, oil dependency: Rylan's fans are super smart & super woke people! Not that it's a surprise.
9118 2018-02-24 18:01:51 involves filling an empty Windex bottle with lavender mineral oil, then relabeling the bottle "Quiet Spray."

9122 2018-02-24 18:01:37 why are people singing and advertising about sunflower oil? it’s oil ffs not holy water. go home

9124 2018-02-24 18:01:36 Lol or the ability to even be able to think, you can afford to actually be an idiot if you own an oil well.
9125 2018-02-24 18:01:35 Ha! I’m pretty sure mine was from when I was compulsively reading HFBoards and my hockey friends were all on it. I remember signing up during an oil change or some similar car experience.
9126 2018-02-24 18:01:33 then i'm sure you saw  the oil hand painted movie #LovingVincent  .. spectacular .. up for an oscar :)
9127 2018-02-24 18:01:29 wow fish oil really works 
9128 2018-02-24 18:01:20 ok but when I went to the strip club I literally asked the girl bc she was so freakin soft & she said coconut oil!!
9129 2018-02-24 18:01:20 Nigerians with over analytical minds are idiotic hounds. That woman made millions long before she was given an oil block! If you say otedola, they’ll mention his dad, talk about dangote, they’ll say granddaddy money, Alakija oil block, before that, these guys were enterprising
9130 2018-02-24 18:01:12 Jamaican Black Castor Oil, Argan Oil, Vitamin E Oil, and a little bit of Lavendar
9131 2018-02-24 18:01:11 To me it’s very fishy and really slimy in the mouth. I have problems w textures an aversion to it. it’s a REALLY dark red meat and if you like sushi you may like it. Seal oil  is used for many things as well. It’s all very healthy the meat is very lean.
9132 2018-02-24 18:01:03 Oil Group Reports Rise in Confidence in North Sea Projects
9133 2018-02-24 18:01:03 i've used lush's "damaged" hot oil treatment a couple times & i loved it!
9134 2018-02-24 18:00:47 Yes, but there is nothing positive about promoting taking taxi cabs in a mega city unless you are super duper into traffic, pollution, climate change & oil dependency.
9135 2018-02-24 18:00:47 Is it me or is the oil in Titus sardine naw watery
9136 2018-02-24 18:00:45 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
9137 2018-02-24 18:00:45 do not use heat on it as much bc it causes split ends! this might sound gross or whatever but do not wash it every day, do like every other day or every 2 days if you can! you can also do coconut oil masks every once in a while to make it healthier
9138 2018-02-24 17:59:55 ..omg this reminds me I have rosemary in oil in the cupboard I was going to make lipbalm out of SHITE I HOPE IT'S NOT GONE BAD
9139 2018-02-24 17:59:48 OMG I MUST KNOW HIS IT TURNS OUT!! I’ve almost used up my oil xD
9140 2018-02-24 17:59:40 In Cape Town all public toilets have waterless hand wash
I’m not sure this is effective enough for the dreaded Listerosis. I’ve bought a waterless hand cleaner that contains
Tea tree oil
9141 2018-02-24 17:59:32 It takes me 2 hours and 2 travel size containers of castor oil for me not to look like Florida Evans. Then it takes me 1 hour to clean up the extra naps that fall all over the place. Stop asking me if I feel liberated with short hair. No bih.
9142 2018-02-24 17:59:24 i have a fav cookie from my great grandmother that uses "enough vegetable oil so that dough doesnt peak" and it has taken me about 10 tries to figure out how long to properly bake

9145 2018-02-24 17:59:22 Why is the gop full of such terrible people? Like objectively terrible people. Even in a biblical sense. Republican voters are smarter then that to trust these snake oil salespersons, right?
9146 2018-02-24 17:58:53 We are winning war against oil theft in Bayelsa – NSCDC -
9147 2018-02-24 17:58:44 That is correct. Approximately 8 years earlier he told my class that I wouldn’t have a zit if I weren’t overweight—the oil in my fat was coming out on my skin. At the time I weighed 135 pounds. Definitely arm him to the teeth.
9148 2018-02-24 17:58:41 Imho, you need to have a strong basic skincare routine before incorporate facial oil in your routine. And you have to understand your skin so you can adjust the facial oil accordingly to your routine.

9150 2018-02-24 17:58:31 @beardbrand when are you guys going to do another limited edition oil like the Black Marble?
9151 2018-02-24 17:58:20 You have asked who will do that? Oil can do that. The way those empty head sheikhs compromised their respect and integrity , it is much better not to be like them.
Mir Jaffer aur Mir sadiq in kay samnay sharma jain.
9152 2018-02-24 17:58:16 Last time I went on a road trip I changed my oil because it was due 
9153 2018-02-24 17:57:56 guy and and started refueling straight from 100 upto 200 and charged that man 300 rs this is how normally people are cheated mostly on your petrol pump I won't advise anybody to ever refuel from @IndianOilcl oil petrol pumps. (2)
9154 2018-02-24 17:57:41 Of course, all oil based. You could also say that Libyan GDP was better than US and Cuba. (combined) Yet still 40% of Libyans lived in poverty because the oil wealth went to the Qaddafi family.
9155 2018-02-24 17:57:36 Nazi Zombies? Or do you mean OIL still?

9159 2018-02-24 17:56:47 Somebody mimaw was just in the vintage store talking about her bed bugs and how she don’t be playing with them. Zapping them with tea tree oil. I kindly gathered all my things and left. I don’t know if those things run, jump or skip to my Lou. But I wasn’t trying to find out.
9160 2018-02-24 17:56:47 Started planning for building a wall, started fixing trade deals, pulling out of climate accords, keep Gtmo open, GROWTH OF GDP BY 4%, deregulate oil. I could keep going if you want
9161 2018-02-24 17:56:43 Sweat your onions and gaelic over medium-high heat in a tablespoon of olive oil with salt and pepper
9162 2018-02-24 17:56:33 I go to get an oil change. There’s about 6 open chairs and this guy had to sit next to me... why....
9163 2018-02-24 17:56:31 I saw people saying what is an oil bloc, she made it on her own Bla Bla Bla......oil bloc wey dey gush mad money back then!
9164 2018-02-24 17:56:31 I’m all for getting @NRA #BloodMoney out of politics oh and they funneled illegal foreign funds to US campaigns including @POTUS in violation of federal campaign laws so #FollowTheMoney #Resist #NeverAgain
9165 2018-02-24 17:56:30 I just want bleach blonde 360 lace hair on my caramel skin. Its lit. I like my hair a bunch but i like to experiment not everybody wants to natural. Don’t say nothing because I’m more versed then your face dipped in coconut oil.
9166 2018-02-24 17:56:20 We just got some new *CBD COCONUT OIL*
9167 2018-02-24 17:56:16 YOU ARE THE OIL FOR THE MACHINE I seriously wouldn't be anywhere near this far along without your support tho

I doubt I would have started in the first place
9168 2018-02-24 17:56:13 If avoiding an oil change was an Olympic sport I would have a wall of gold medals.
9169 2018-02-24 17:56:06 It doesn't get you "high". I am suing in federal court for the right to cannabis buds to make the Holy oil. It is required by my religion to give it to people as Jesus told his diciples to do.  There are medical records attached to my action that prove it works.
9170 2018-02-24 17:55:52 oil pulling mas conocido como esa cosa que no voy a probar nunca
9171 2018-02-24 17:55:49 It’s also hypocritical moralizing the acceptance of that “award” from a government that was killing ordinary (and activist) Nigerians in daytime, and awarding oil blocs to cronies at night.
9172 2018-02-24 17:55:32 Not too bad even. Been basing with coconut & castor oil mixture 
9173 2018-02-24 17:55:28 But is it even tasty, like our vadai that is fried in Olive Oil? Never dared to try that.
9174 2018-02-24 17:55:17 Time would come; when the wealth of this country would be redistributed....there was a time a retired general confessed that he was given an oil well by Abacha and today he's one of the richest men in the continent.
Arab like revolution is imminent.
9175 2018-02-24 17:55:16 A case for the re-introduction of retail price maintenance. And that coming from an oil company veteran!
9176 2018-02-24 17:55:09 as I remember to check the oil....
9177 2018-02-24 17:55:08 Fixed my oil leak by plugging the oil pressure sensor. Now as long
9178 2018-02-24 17:55:02 Her social media handlers just need to calm down with the faith and God stories. People are tired of hearing it. How much was she worth before the oil block? How did she get the oil block? How did she finance the acquisition? These are some of the questions people are asking.
9179 2018-02-24 17:55:02 You are astonishingly misinformed. A broken-up Exxon Mobile would be tremendously beneficial to the oil and gas industry. So, by all means- boycott!
9180 2018-02-24 17:54:59 Have you ever tried to mix oil and water? 

Proof Lord Jesus and King Jehovah are the one true God!
9181 2018-02-24 17:54:56 Today I started using raw coconut oil for lotion. I smell like a melted paleta in TJ. #DatingSarahMae

9183 2018-02-24 17:53:57 There is no oil change only ZUUL!!!!!  LOL
9184 2018-02-24 17:53:56 For the dog, and NuLeaf makes a great pet-specific CBD oil. Assuming you've already tried Clomicalm.
9185 2018-02-24 17:53:52 That's a good link, I don't rate Charlotte's Web Oil, nust check out the others though
9186 2018-02-24 17:53:47 Have you tried Olbas oil? It helps 
9187 2018-02-24 17:53:39 I miss you p.oil 
9188 2018-02-24 17:53:36 I have been making and taking the Holy oil for about 2 years now. I give it to the sick as Jesus intended and they get well. Yes..it heals many problems including addictions to meth, oxy, cigarettes and more. It helps people to SLEEP which is one of the biggest problems we have.
9189 2018-02-24 17:53:27 How about some fortune distributed to black folk in Tampa? I still can't get over the fact that you all used $15 million in oil spill money and communities like East Tampa have to pay for a little playground for their kids. Next to a park named after Clarence Fort. SMH.
9190 2018-02-24 17:53:20 I need to go get an oil change

9192 2018-02-24 17:53:09 Really? You're going to counter this with Vani Hari - a THOROUGHLY discredited charlatan and snake oil salesman? I suggest you Google HER before you use her to support any arguments you have.
9193 2018-02-24 17:53:07 Their sunflower oil has a butter flavor profile when it's hot, so I'd bet their popcorn is delicious!

9203 2018-02-24 17:51:43 Ha! In my experience, it's by accidentally putting too much oil in the pan for the first one(s). At that point, the last isn't as pretty as the first!
9204 2018-02-24 17:51:31 Yeah, thought briefly about heading down to see you and then realised that -2deg Oil suggested Popham possibly semi-glacial. Stayed in, by the fire. #Toasty
9205 2018-02-24 17:51:25 Oil averaged almost $100 in 2008 but only $62 in 2009, so that doesn’t line up...
9206 2018-02-24 17:51:18 You have laws currently made by corrupt politicians in the pockets of corporate lobbyists & foreign enemies, led by an emotionally devoid, intellectually sub-normal snake oil salesman & sex offender. Can't see these youngsters doing a worse job.

Step 3: Go back to work while she searches for a lengthy time. 

My daughter thinks spoons are necessary to change oil, cook, and file taxes.

9215 2018-02-24 17:50:33 Folorunsho before acquiring the oil bloc had other businesses and she strikes me as a very hardworking person. Even though she got the bloc through lobbying, she built her network and that's  is a lot of work and experience. Nigerians should go and rest

9218 2018-02-24 17:49:29 @realDonaldTrump says windmills are ugly. I think oil derricks are much uglier! Much, much uglier!

@AliVelshi
9219 2018-02-24 17:49:20 Cover it with brown paper and put a warm iron on it. Oil heats, paper absorbs it out of the fabric. Don’t use the hottest setting though

9221 2018-02-24 17:49:09 Probably just annoyed that it wasn't running on olive oil or something.
9222 2018-02-24 17:49:09 The recipe comes down from the Judaic and Hebrew translations. It is virgin oilive oil, cannabis buds, oil of myrrh, and oils of cinnamon bark and cinnamon leaf. That is why these preachers that have infiltrated our churches don't preach the Old Testament.

9230 2018-02-24 17:47:57 How much did the OIL cost you?
9231 2018-02-24 17:47:55 @thekingofrandom so if you used a 0 weight synthetic oil i.e 0w20 would it make a thinner ferrofluid?

9234 2018-02-24 17:47:40 Allocation was done during the military era where all acts of the juntas were quasi legal. She was the only one who applied for license to explore for oil on a supposedly "barren" 617,000 acre block (OPL 216) which was granted. 

How did she steal from better qualified managers?

9241 2018-02-24 17:46:50 You mean corporations have a shred of conscience left? Where have they been the past 20 years??? What about weapons sales 2 kill Yemeni civilians, pharmaceutical rip offs, destruction of climate, oil train bombs, oil & gas pipelines contaminating water supplies, ad nauseum.
9242 2018-02-24 17:46:39 @alakijaofficial thinks we were all born yesterday. We know how oil blocs are allocated and It is not by hard work.
9243 2018-02-24 17:46:35 A family of grifters, running a scam operation out of the WH. The RNC so tied in due to their own bank accts filled w/Russian $; scared complicit.

9249 2018-02-24 17:46:05 Yes, of course. It's been calculated many times, it's not rocket science. It's really a bunch of balony that we need fossil fuels, we can power 2500+global economies with solar, instead of one with coal, gas and oil.

9252 2018-02-24 17:45:43 Nothing like a third country civil war to test out your new weaponry. Same civilian casualty taste with none of the combatant casualty calories. Unless you’re a Russian mercenary trying to capture an oil rig.

9318 2018-02-24 17:37:00 He say after God na Government
9319 2018-02-24 17:36:52 That money does not come from lobbying but from dues and other sources. The other industries get favorable laws for their drugs or telecoms or oil and gas. All they do is defend citizens rights to have weapons to defend themselves.
9320 2018-02-24 17:36:24 I have some somewhere, but it’s generally fine with the trace oil I’ll spill on it and wipe away making dinner tonight. If the grain is raised in use, i might make another pass with a purple scotchbrite. The Small Richlite board doesn’t need a finish.
9321 2018-02-24 17:36:18 People going to be getting income tax money and go buy lv and Gucci bags but still have check engine lights on their vehicle with a 2 year old oil change due.

9328 2018-02-24 17:35:37 Don't forget the Broward School Board- equally complicit.
9329 2018-02-24 17:35:36 Chat shit you cannabis oil is not illegal so why would he be getting done? 
9330 2018-02-24 17:35:34 How much  is the Federal Government giving these companies?? YOU APPLAUD CORPORATE WELFARE but complain about TAX BREAKS for the oil companies.

One, the Government is GIVING tax  to companies. The other, the Government is TAKEN LESS  tax .

9342 2018-02-24 17:33:01 There's an easy solution. Ottawa should slap a 50% "unity" tax on foreign oil to be phased in by 2020. Two years is long enough to build correct infrastructure.
9343 2018-02-24 17:33:00 On a more serious note, apparently oil blocks can be gotten by faith in Nigeria and this is very unfortunate. I'm sure some pastor will use this in church on Sunday- sow a seed, your faith shall grow and the gov't will dash you oil blocks.
9344 2018-02-24 17:32:44 Eddie Jones is going to boil their livers in oil after that first half. COME ON SCOTLAND! #SCOvENG

9346 2018-02-24 17:32:39 The only way to curb oil dependence is to find alternative sources of fuel. Hence, the additional excise tax on oil, diesel to influence consumer behaviour to use greener source of energy. Govt also provided incentive to the use of solar and wind power.

9348 2018-02-24 17:32:16 I could use an oil bloc tho.. at least, it'll help me achieve my goals a lot quicker
9349 2018-02-24 17:31:59 I was annoyed that the neighbours must be having *another* bonfire, but it turns out I've left a frying pan with oil and bits of burnt chicken on a medium-high heat since 1pm

9359 2018-02-24 17:31:16 Not so bad- just really arrogant- maybe some humility- & maybe do what we say we’ll do- maybe build those schools in Afghanistan in the 1980s and we wouldn’t have had Osama Bin Laden hate us. Maybe not be in bed w Saudi Arabia- where all the pilots came from /9/11 - but OIL- GWB

9381 2018-02-24 17:29:15 Hey dude, the law of supply and demand has never changed. It was, is and it will be the one to dictate how the market behaves. PH is an oil-dependent, oil-importing country, PH govt can’t control global market forces. Domestically, oil industry has been deregulated.
9382 2018-02-24 17:29:13 My nan has finally agreed to give my dog CBD oil and I'm so happy
9383 2018-02-24 17:29:11 Warm water + tea tree oil + coconut & hibiscus

9387 2018-02-24 17:28:46 Truth is if they knew Alakija’s oil bloc was gonna be that productive she wouldnt have gotten it. An oil bloc is not automatic wealth o. You can sink $50m and walk away with nothing but law suits
9388 2018-02-24 17:28:43 dough is not interchangeable you cannot pour marinara sauce on a cake and call it a pasta dish just because both cake and pasta uses butter oil eggs
9389 2018-02-24 17:28:42 What ya'll know about oil. Got 2 oil well heads right here.
9390 2018-02-24 17:28:36 The place will look really good with a few oil derricks and some mining trailings. You are not a Snowflake NIMBY are ya?

Your MCM is a compound idiot.
9399 2018-02-24 17:26:52 My car always feels amazing after an oil change 
9400 2018-02-24 17:26:40 After almost 3 years (!!!) my favorite styling creme is empty- L'Anza Healing Oil Combing Creme. It's expensive but it works wonders on my hair.  Wait....Amazon doesn't have it anymore!? NOOOOOOOO!
9401 2018-02-24 17:26:35 This administration has taken $50mm in monthly oil revenue from ISIS. Why don’t you call that out.

9409 2018-02-24 17:25:44 Again without pic. He shd do work rather than asking for pay without doing any work. PPL n other oil firms give royalty to Sardar’s ask them to feed him.

9412 2018-02-24 17:25:41 I’m all for this carbon tax if it also applies to imported goods and oil. #LevelThePlayingField also still no answer to @MichelleRempel  reg what the effects would be setting the price to $40.

9422 2018-02-24 17:24:28 Of course they seem stupid to the people around them, because carelessness causes unnecessary problems. Say that careless person knowing right from wrong, spills oil on the floor doesn't wipe it up, forgets about it, then someone comes along and slips on it, who's effected?
9423 2018-02-24 17:24:20 Try CBD oil from Amazon to keep the pain away. Worked wonders for my knee.

9427 2018-02-24 17:24:08 It is terrible that our infrastructure is crumbling so badly that this is the choice we have to make. But let's not pretend this is anything like an oil spill, or that the impacts will be catastrophic.

9430 2018-02-24 17:23:21 Try taking some Valerian Root, drinking a small Kratom tea, or using CBD oil based products. Stuff works pretty well at killing off the anxiety for me anyway.

9434 2018-02-24 17:23:07 How late are you going to be there? I was planning to go to the mall after work and an oil change, so around 5pm.
9435 2018-02-24 17:22:55 Gulf Oil...OMG blast from the past.  RIGHT the hit was epic....and didn't they change the glass soon after That?? Also the dang gets now...no pucks in the crowd. We had season tickets 5 rows from the goal in the Pacific Col. Heads up pay attention..we scored a lot of pucks.

9447 2018-02-24 17:21:48 You mean fighting, and defeating, I.S, the *actual* terrorists, destroying their 'caliphate', freeing those Arabs, Turkmen, sex slaves and dismantling the infrastructure for launching attacks across the world?

Whilst Turkey just watched, sorry, watched, armed and bought oil off

9452 2018-02-24 17:21:20 Wow, and I was up until 5am dealing with my bank because to my debit card I never authorized. Warning companies use these trail offers to rip people off. Never purchasing CBD Oil again not worth the pain involved.

9457 2018-02-24 17:21:08 Christopher Steele laid out a narrative of quid pro quo. The Russians would help Trump get elected and in return Trump would lift sanctions and receive 19% of Rosneft, an integrated oil company owned by the Russian Government.

Time to put on his Big Boy Pants & deal with BC re there illegal stalling the twinning of an existing pipeline. It willgive billions more equalization $ to “Have Not Provinces” like Que & Ont. They could stop buying Oil from USA, Saudi Sheiks, Venezuela

9467 2018-02-24 17:19:49 Skadden served on several oil M&A transactions with Russian companies of oligarchs connected to Trump.

In one, Rex Tillerson's ExxonMobil won exploration rights because TNK-BP sued BP to keep them out.

Skadden also helped Wilbur Ross in the Navigator Holdings acquisition.

9471 2018-02-24 17:19:25 Tbh I don't think people who were gifted oil wells really ve a "success story" to tell, that's a fucking money printer right there, never known anybody who's gotten one who ever became poor again or who isn't a billionaire, there's no financial intelligence required to manage one
9472 2018-02-24 17:19:20 The media is also setting themselves up to be able to reject ads paid for by the NRA this November. Which they hope will hurt republicans.
9473 2018-02-24 17:19:15 Accepting oil bloc by faith in a period when Gulf war oil was the prime & like a diamond cake @alakijaofficial 
We hope same oil bloc can be given to many YOUTHS too so we share same faith for a glorified tomorrow. 
I wonder the kind of faith I need when given an oil block 2day.

9478 2018-02-24 17:18:04 @ChefDPhillips Watching an old episode of Southern At Heart on-demand & it's the $30 date episode.  I had no idea you could substitute mayo for eggs & oil like you did in the mason jar pot de creme. WHAT?? I've used mayo in cookie dough to keep cookies moist - no mayo taste. :)
9479 2018-02-24 17:18:03 Oil will be used in the world. It can come from Canada where there are strict environmental regs or 3rd world where there are none. I worked in Libya where in 1 field 40K BBL/day of oilfield prod water went to a sand pit to soak away. ? 3rd world oil prod/use. @OilsandsAction

9484 2018-02-24 17:17:22 Is it usual to have oil massaged on your breasts when having a facial. I haven't had one for ages? It was very pleasant just rather unexpected 
9485 2018-02-24 17:17:21 (3/2) And I’m not taking a firm stand on where o/s fits in that ordering. It may well be reduced/ with $200/t (Or it may not; depends on resource rent/oil price). But blocking pipelines is far most costly $/t. I’m just arguing for efficiency in reducing our emissions. Ttyl.
9486 2018-02-24 17:17:06 It just makes me sad we still use oil.  Energy is everywhere but (MEN) needed profit to profit from something
9487 2018-02-24 17:17:04 BTW, I still haven't figured out why it's perfectly acceptable to IMPORT foreign oil onto the east coast, yet utterly unacceptable to EXPORT domestic oil from either coast.
9488 2018-02-24 17:16:43 I don’t condone the state of the river prior... the oil spill has made a bad thing worse. It could be utilised to draw wider attention to the need of an overall clean up

9491 2018-02-24 17:16:37 That one guy is right though . . . Putin and his chef don't give a damn about them.  You know the chef had a deal to get a cut of the oil revenues from that refinery they were trying to take, right?  They died for his money.
9492 2018-02-24 17:16:32 Thanks! I take Vit D anyway but I had forgotten for a few days so not sure if it was really hormonal or low Vit d levels. I will add in some fish oils- do you rate those over starflower oil?
9493 2018-02-24 17:16:29 Dude, I started doing pink sea salt and coconut or avocado oil on it and it is an awesome buttery taste !!

9497 2018-02-24 17:16:01 So to clarify - you say this isn’t the case with the oil on its own? Can you email me Ross? - tweeting isn’t the easiest place to have in depth conversation. This isn’t something that fits with what I know - so I think there’s a missing variable here to find.

9501 2018-02-24 17:15:50 Our crude oil is being refined outside the country.
9502 2018-02-24 17:15:47 @JustinTrudeau bad judgement on "friends" from terror groups makes you wonder - how bad is his judgement on dirty oil, Kinder Morgan, #ClimateChange and his other friends like Alberta's @RachelNotley
9503 2018-02-24 17:15:34 This is quite a small amount of stuff vs total volume of water. It will be diluted quickly and in a matter of weeks there will be no sign they did this. Name an oil spill where that happened.
9504 2018-02-24 17:15:26 He doth protest too much.
9505 2018-02-24 17:15:22 don't worry about it as long as the oil and gas companies and coal companies are making mony that's all that counts in trumpland.
9506 2018-02-24 17:15:16 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
9507 2018-02-24 17:15:09 I'll take a viral clip to fix the problem of refined oil. Gullible people deserve nothing more. people should make their own oil. Grow corn (easy) and buy a small oil press. Healthy organic oil!
9508 2018-02-24 17:14:54 I literally listen to Lillian Lloyd everyday. I never heard someone adlib in the spirit on a song for 14minutes and 50 seconds & not repeat themselves. Now that’s OIL !! Flowing in the spirit!
9509 2018-02-24 17:14:48 See lets clarify this Alakija thing. Whilst people say it was oil bloc gifted to her, let’s actually break down how this scenario came about. Now I don’t have the exact dates with facts, but it’s pretty much the story. You deduce conclusion for yourself. Thread.
9510 2018-02-24 17:14:47 While you were distracted by Trump's tweets, Mitch McConnell began drilling for oil in millions of food stamp users.

9524 2018-02-24 17:13:10 Completely lucked out at the express oil change today...zero line on a Saturday. Gotta stop and buy a powerball on the way home.
9525 2018-02-24 17:13:09 Brushed my teeth a few years ago, then did an oil-pull and the amount of food that the oil dislodged was a revelation to me, brushing is useless compared to oil-pulling.
9526 2018-02-24 17:12:58 Don't know, the rag heads need to spend the oil money on something hahaha
9527 2018-02-24 17:12:55 his manhood - it’s plastic and comes with built in no thinking field. Love those muffs btw - just like a real gunslinger! 
9528 2018-02-24 17:12:47 Ur right.. Was about to write Olive oil is best, Canola oil is next best. Tongue slip
9529 2018-02-24 17:12:41 Cereals and olive oil.
9530 2018-02-24 17:12:07 Good, why doesn't it just stick to selling snake oil and vitamins to the gullible.
Even it's guiding hand admitted in court what he spouts is utter tripe.
9531 2018-02-24 17:12:00 Typical NDP to tie the economy up in bureaucratic red tape. Never once saw a B.C. government refused any money received from oil sale but just don’t want to help with getting it to markets.
9532 2018-02-24 17:11:59  bro, I just come back from hiatus since Oct. 2016.
9533 2018-02-24 17:11:58 Technology scares people who don't like diversity. You have to rely on old stuff, like oil and gas. That will relegate the next generation of Americans to low-paid, dead end jobs. Companies who want to meet the world needs, will simply move overseas to meet their employment needs

9535 2018-02-24 17:11:46 They were technically equipped for governance but when they got in, situation on ground was bigger than what they anticipated, many factors also crept in which were beyond them. For example; They don't have control over the crashed crude oil price. That's just it!
9536 2018-02-24 17:11:19 The oil and gas industry’s freeloading has crippled #oklaed, and other vital state services. The idea that anyone would support a plan that continues to let the industry cheat our state is not just ignorant, it’s morally repugnant. We will pass 7% ourselves at the ballot. #okleg
9537 2018-02-24 17:11:18 Yes!!! It’s the worst on top I had a random allergic reaction and broke out with hives smh  so that made it even worst. I started taking fish oil w omega 3 suppose to help with breakouts. I’ll def try the plant
9538 2018-02-24 17:11:13 The 500+ likes shows how misinformed people are about what oil corporations really stand for. They destroy nature and control governments with puppet politicians with a stranglehold on most Third World countries
9539 2018-02-24 17:11:09 using religion for convenience.
9540 2018-02-24 17:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza today will be: sad crust with fresh motor oil and philly beef.
9541 2018-02-24 17:10:46 Don't let your hair get into your face while you sleep. The oil from your hair can cause acne.
9542 2018-02-24 17:10:25 I’m old enough to remember when oil company mercenaries were spraying water on Native American in Dakota winter and you said let’s see how it plays out... I guess when you we’ve been waiting for you, you literally meant doing nothing but waiting

9548 2018-02-24 17:09:39 1. Speculative deal that has been ruled out by Europe. 2. Have you ACTUALLY spoken to any oil and gas leaders, as I’m not hearing the same.
9549 2018-02-24 17:09:38 If anyone wants a hazelnut chocolate spread that doesn't contain palm oil and can access a Costco, they've made their own spread and it is good.
9550 2018-02-24 17:09:35 There is 1.1 million barrels of day of crude oil refined in eastern Canada
It's going to be 1.1 million whether it is Canadian oil, US oil or Saudi oil

9552 2018-02-24 17:09:27 I got my essential oil diffuser, my skincare, my vitamin d pills, it's Saturday, and I'm ready to do absolutely nothing of note today
9553 2018-02-24 17:09:21 Cause they put too much coconut oil on her face
9554 2018-02-24 17:09:16 Expanding on Clive Humbly's quote, "Data is the new oil. It's valuable, but if unrefined it cannot really be used" @engelAnalytics is beginning his talk on Pitchf/x data at @SloanSportsConf #TalkDataToMe in CA West.

9558 2018-02-24 17:08:45 Am I drinking snake oil?
9559 2018-02-24 17:08:37 Air. No oil at all
9560 2018-02-24 17:08:16 In this case, almost any liquid will do which will thin the oil. A small amount or sulphuric acid, varnish, water-glass, or linseed oil will be especially effective.

9563 2018-02-24 17:07:55 Have you ever noticed that settlement and restitution in civil lawsuits in the U.S. and around the world are in currency - not Bitcoin, gold, oil....or potatoes? CASH: accepted everywhere - hackable nowhere.

9565 2018-02-24 17:07:48 What is that on your knee?
9566 2018-02-24 17:07:41 Don’t be afraid to try a roux! It’s just flour and oil. Watch some videos, try it. Even if you burn it, there’s no harm, just keep trying, and think about the lovely gumbo at the end! I’ll be happy to give some pointers! Just lemme know!
9567 2018-02-24 17:07:35 nope - Ravioli is flour eggs and salt and savory.  Pop tarts have Thiamin Mononitrate Corn Syrup  Dextros soybean oil with TBHQ for "freshness" sugar, cracker meal pressed in dried fruit.  Pasta is fresh not sweetened Riboflaven'd .   So no... no dear it is not Ravioli -try again
9568 2018-02-24 17:07:27 I'll go over it in my tutorial, but there's actually no black in them, just some Nuln Oil

9571 2018-02-24 17:07:19 Wait. An air fryer fries with air? Or with oil? I need answers.
9572 2018-02-24 17:07:09 The problem most people have with Folorunsho Alakija is that she constantly pontificates on how to make it or how she made it e.t.c and always "forgets" to state that an Oil bloc gift was the major reason she became who she became ...no one hates her
9573 2018-02-24 17:07:06 ياهو ويكندي كله اذاكر في النهايه يتأجل لا لا
9574 2018-02-24 17:06:56 Canola oil is low in saturated fat. Canola oil has a higher smoke point than olive oil and can be used safely for cooking at high temperatures.

9576 2018-02-24 17:06:48 Anyway, since i started double cleansing and using body shop’s face wash, toner and tea tree oil, i think my face is at its most healthiest and cleanest state ever
9577 2018-02-24 17:06:24 Nothing enhances the flavor quite like gas fumes, carbon monoxide, and slightly burnt oil taste.

9579 2018-02-24 17:06:16 Haha the NRA doesn't run the country. WallStreet BigPharma Oil&Blood Sucking War & Prison Profiteers 

Delta & United won't give NRA members discounts? Do they give discounts to any of the aholes involved in lobbying for & accepting $ from the above mentioned entities?
9580 2018-02-24 17:06:08 Ohhh yes it was... By somebody that works for the Grandson of oil magnate J Paul Getty
9581 2018-02-24 17:06:06 Terrifying to see the Sunlight Foundation still raising funds by selling legislative transparency, when all evidence suggests it benefits the NRA, big oil and big pharma. PLEASE STOP
9582 2018-02-24 17:05:56 I agree pipelines is wrong focus. *If* you accept oil production, *then* you have to accept best way to transport it. Bitumen causes 8% of Cda emissions, at 2% of GDP. Is getting AB buy-in on CTax worth it? That’s a political calculus & public doesn’t have all factors.
9583 2018-02-24 17:05:56 I’d rather the oil men win the next twenty premier leagues then the rats win one 

Sorry for being honest 
9584 2018-02-24 17:05:44 I also believe that there are just as many Left wing SJW bots as there are Russian bots. Right, @jack ?
9585 2018-02-24 17:05:27 Girl just now leaving frm getting my oil changed
9586 2018-02-24 17:05:19 I should have gotten coffee and breakfast before take my car in for an oil change.
9587 2018-02-24 17:05:14 First better then best is the right way. Now it reads Olive oil is best but canola oil is better which makes it the best! LOL!
9588 2018-02-24 17:05:14 Why do you say canola is not good. It is one of the good oils for health definitely better than groundnut oil
9589 2018-02-24 17:05:10 With eucalyptus oil drops in the shower ufffff 
9590 2018-02-24 17:04:49 Oil needs to be near $80 per barrel to make the profit picture work. Donald has done a good job in raising the prices, that way the Middle East can pay for the weapons they are buying for us
American oil companies will profit more, as will Russia
9591 2018-02-24 17:04:48 me: *tries to save money*
guy at brake check: “your oil change is finished but your tire alignment is almost dangerous”
 ok let’s pay for that too
9592 2018-02-24 17:04:39 Canada's immigration system operates on a points- basis which is pretty strict and specific in what it wants. Unless I'm a millionaire, a famous actor, an oil engineer or a farmer that can speak 2 languages, Canada has no use for me X3.
9593 2018-02-24 17:04:35 hanty you didn't put cooking oil 
9594 2018-02-24 17:04:29 Harp oil (for the strings)
9595 2018-02-24 17:04:21 I bought ghee and MCT oil! I'll add collagen as my second stage haha. I hope it's good
9596 2018-02-24 17:04:17 Today is not a very successful day. I’ve:
1. Burned my ear whilst curling my hair (I was busy trying to keep my fingers away from the tong)
2. Been knocked over by an angry cow at a children’s park farm party 
3. Spilled hot oil on my fingers trying to turn my roast potatoes over
9597 2018-02-24 17:03:51 Secret ingredient ng ramen: essential oil 
9598 2018-02-24 17:03:50 Olive oil is best, Canola oil is better.

9600 2018-02-24 17:03:16 I used to fly to a wee runway at the Flottal oil terminal in the Orkney Isles in the 80s on something similar. The pilot would circle, watching till a wee man had chased the sheep away off the runway till he could land 
9601 2018-02-24 17:03:04 one time i left a bottle of olive oil at maria's house so i went back to get it and i found her gently caressing the olive oil while crying
9602 2018-02-24 17:03:02 Senator, with all due respect, these interventionist adventures need to stop! We do a horrible job leading/Spt regime change. We spend billions of tax dollars failing miserably to prop govs and rebuild. We have enough oil in country 4 our own needs. Empire building must stop.
9603 2018-02-24 17:02:32 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.

9607 2018-02-24 17:02:12 Did you blame Obama for the BP oil spill?
9608 2018-02-24 17:02:09 I just started taking MCT oil and less than a tblsp ramps up my energy immensely, I thought it's intended effect. Is it really good pre-sleep too?
9609 2018-02-24 17:02:07 Btw I’ve been using a homemade coconut oil and sugar facial scrub for a couple weeks now and my beard dander is gone! 
Also delicious.
9610 2018-02-24 17:01:58 Anti-aging hand treatment - soak your hands in milk for 15 mins. Rinse then apply a bit of olive oil on them.
9611 2018-02-24 17:01:51 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.

9618 2018-02-24 17:01:11 Oh, Saudi Arabia? You mean the place that Republicans love to keep close to heart because of their oil money, who repress human rights, and who sent 19 nationals to attack us on 9/11 and were not held accountable by the sitting Republican President? That Saudi Arabia?

9621 2018-02-24 17:01:09 Ok, @trevortombe, not bad. AB’s 40% doesn’t include embedded emissions (unless I misunderstand). Those are the emissions from *producing* the oil (flaring for wells, heating for bitumen).
9622 2018-02-24 17:01:00 i guess it defends how much oil there is. they take 'soiled' paper towels....
9623 2018-02-24 17:00:56 Except we’re not. Even the oil Barron’s can’t do that

9628 2018-02-24 17:00:29 @MichaelRapaport’s podcast ratings are getting that Wonder bread bag treatment (no olive oil)
9629 2018-02-24 17:00:28 How about addressing your states severe addiction to Oil Revenue and the violence to people and the planet that causes?
9630 2018-02-24 17:00:23 You probably remember your oil changes, but don't forget about your filters! Dirty filters can increase your fuel usage by as much as 10%.

9632 2018-02-24 17:00:15 And he made billions transporting oil via train, which is why Obama was against Keystone XL.
9633 2018-02-24 17:00:11 Yes it could be. but in this case probably not.
Its a culture of failure to look properly at how others do it (RA). Strange as leaders are Oil & Gas, Chemical, even road & rail.

Refine and ship fuel and gas . Much safer transporting finished product and keep refining jobs local .
9639 2018-02-24 16:59:17 would you rub lebron james down in oil for 5k?
9640 2018-02-24 16:59:14 I don't know much about what went down, but with the trend at the time being oil, and Nigeria having international standard oil, the risk of it not being viable does not outweigh that of it being viable. I can be wrong, this is just an assumption going by the oil trend at d time.

9661 2018-02-24 16:56:34 I need some beard oil or sum
9662 2018-02-24 16:56:34 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
9663 2018-02-24 16:56:13 Ugh I hope I don’t either  I didn’t buy any of their additional packages and they weren’t too happy about that. I’ll remember that for the oil changes though thank you!
9664 2018-02-24 16:56:12 She's just disturbing herself. She can give me the oil well if she doesn't want
9665 2018-02-24 16:56:08 This one said my lips look like oil..I dunno what typa compliment is this 
9666 2018-02-24 16:55:44 Super misleading. Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain were all in serious trouble, Greece was near bankrupt. Northern Europe economies are stellar. Germany kept Greece from defaulting. Libyan GDP was all oil based. 40% of Libyans still poor.
9667 2018-02-24 16:55:26 Senator: Why don’t you call for a Declaration of War Against Russia and see how many big mouth Senators vote with you.  Sanctions against Russia will not work.  Drill Baby Drill to bring down the price of oil if you want to get their attention.  JM
9668 2018-02-24 16:55:06 The Spanish have a beer called "Cannabis Club" that's flavored with hemp oil and I have learned it is Not For Me.

9670 2018-02-24 16:55:00 I have such an adult like to do list today. I need an oil change. Major has a vet appointment. I need to buy a new set of pots & pans. Laundry. I gotta take my car to be detailed. I have dinner plans at someplace fancy. Non-related but related, I need to shave my pussy.
9671 2018-02-24 16:54:53 She will support ketones for babies as soon as Nestle figures out how to mix exogenous ketones with soybean oil and sugar. 
Not much point in arguing science with a marketer.
9672 2018-02-24 16:54:41 Don't know bout u, but I don't care. The folks who r invested in demonizing immigrants & those invested in "truth" about immigration's effects r oil & water.

Ok. Now what? Expend energy trying to woo those from the other side?

Waste of energy, time, & in this case, resources.
9673 2018-02-24 16:54:20 ถ้าโลกไม่โหดร้ายจนเกินไปช่วยเหวี่ยงเราให้เจอเขาอีกสักครั้งจะได้ไหม อยากบอกอะไรเขาหลายอย่างเลย แม้ว่าเขาอาจจะแค่รับฟังแต่ไม่รู้สึกอะไรเลยก็ตาม
9674 2018-02-24 16:54:13 On a serious note, try pure CBD oil. It helps a little bit. Nothing is a cure all for high-anxiety dogs, but it does take the edge off.
9675 2018-02-24 16:54:07 Up early #adulting....Oil Change, Inspection, registration and car wash. All done before 11am. I need a nap now

9679 2018-02-24 16:53:36 Nice one @connachtrugby !
9680 2018-02-24 16:53:26 Eucalyptus oil and products made from it are fairly valuable. Extracting the oil doesn't preclude using the waste material for growing mushrooms.
My original question was regarding the oil not be good for growing mushrooms in.
9681 2018-02-24 16:53:26 The US could be self sufficient in almost every way possible
Ofc they don't need the oil from abroad, it's just a + for capitalists and for working people who need to drive everywhere
As long as a country has something valuable there is a non 0 change of getting invaded by the US
9682 2018-02-24 16:53:12 Why do I always get a coupon for an oil change after I get my oil changed!?! Like you know I’m not going to be back before that coupon expires...
9683 2018-02-24 16:53:11 Please kindly point it out to me. Would like to read it. Also how did she acquire the oil bloc?
9684 2018-02-24 16:53:01 Considering how bad the oil industry has been for Louisiana’s environment this is not a bad thing. This pipeline would flow directly through the Atchafalaya basin. We have seen the effects of deep water horizon and that was in the gulf. Imagine the economical and environmental
9685 2018-02-24 16:52:57 For shiny hair, mix one egg with a olive oil and apply to your hair. Leave it on for 20-30 minutes then shower.
9686 2018-02-24 16:52:46 Smash a load of castor oil on your lashes whilst you’ve got your extensions off! It’s so good
9687 2018-02-24 16:52:35 En algunas adjudicaciones hay accionistas ocultos... solo vean Sierra Oil & Gas...
9688 2018-02-24 16:52:22 Haha! It's lovely over there, enjoy!

9693 2018-02-24 16:51:53 If I were to put heat on it yes I would put heat protectant on it.. but tha doesn't really work for me. For my curls I mostly use cantu coconut curling cream and the olive oil eco styled gel
9694 2018-02-24 16:51:52 @BOINigeria please I'm looking for funds to help me invest in groundnut oil production business. What can I do please?
9695 2018-02-24 16:51:37 Cubed squash tossed in cumin and maple syrup and a small amount of olive oil. Baked in the oven on 400 until done. So tasty!
9696 2018-02-24 16:51:34 If exfoliating gel? Sama ke dgn cleansing oil?
9697 2018-02-24 16:51:33 อยากพบอีกครั้งหนึ่ง อยากซึ้งอีกสักนาที อยากจะทำดีๆกับเธออีกสักครั้ง
9698 2018-02-24 16:51:29 me talking to female customers while covered in oil: “sorry if this is weird but you smell really good”
9699 2018-02-24 16:51:26 I also wonder *Why* you would need to add placenta when both aran and coconut oil are wonderful conditioners.

9701 2018-02-24 16:51:15 But no pipelines for Alberta oil that helps to pay for all your sports programs and daycare, Freaking hypocrites. #thisiswhywedontlikeyou
9702 2018-02-24 16:51:13 Sir, you don’t care about the injustice involved, when a dictator can will the commonwealth to his minions and boot lickers? Alakija, Danjuma and other recipients of oil wells don’t deserve any commendation or default respect in my world view.

9704 2018-02-24 16:51:11 Ja als je praat met de oil&gas branche dan weet je dat dit hun lobby is.
We zetten dus in op omzetting van stroom ipv rechtstreeks inzetten... omdat het beter inpasbaar is lijkt me.....is dat de kant die we op gaan?

9707 2018-02-24 16:50:49 Potato is actually secretly amazing on pizza. My grandparents' village in Italy makes pizza with no sauce, a little bit of olive oil, and thiiiiinly sliced, basically chip sized slices of potato.

And dear god it was the best pizza I'd ever had.
9708 2018-02-24 16:50:38 Although I'm a SPURS fan, I'd love Wenger to turn oil city over, just for pep's reaction and the tears from skysports
9709 2018-02-24 16:50:26 Worked in the oil industry years ago. Only one way for me to describe it:

A jail sentence with a pay cheque.
9710 2018-02-24 16:50:21 For those praying to be full of the oil of the Spirit and to be used of God,understand, there must first be the crushing of the olive, then the oil! When I truly started praying for this, I did not know there were so many ways to crush an olive!
9711 2018-02-24 16:50:18 Massage a few drops of coconut oil around the eyes to get rid off dark circles.

9715 2018-02-24 16:49:50 @Udayansdiary Sir, What chance does an honest, well meaning PSU Oil Company officer have? Few years ago an officer working for India's largest PSU lost his life tackling the adulteration mafia
9716 2018-02-24 16:49:29 ilLegal bribery : b

Maybe US politics should make corruption illegal : )

I would love to see 10-20 prison be the penalty for top officials taking bribes.

But is not back lash against the NRA only to stop them pushing a gun, no so much the way they do it...??

Big oil?? Banks??

9722 2018-02-24 16:49:09 I remember in elementary when my mom would put holy oil on our heads before school  and pray over us . That shit used to drip down my face all the way to the bus stop 
9723 2018-02-24 16:49:08 Texas neighbors are drowning as more oil is burned.
9724 2018-02-24 16:49:06 Oregano oil knows it will hold on! I put it in my water earlier ... drank it .. used the same glass for juice and it’s still in there! Lingering! Strong and nasty! Lol

9730 2018-02-24 16:47:48 10:16 - @sleafordfire attended the A17, East Heckington for scene safety following an RTC. Crew used zorb to soak up a quantity of oil and made one vehicle safe.
9731 2018-02-24 16:47:46 Don't forget to add a little 2 stroke oil to the fuel.

(If we're being metaphorical, that could mean Estrogen, or Glitter, or Both )

9735 2018-02-24 16:46:45 That is today's job! I got my oil changed yesterday
9736 2018-02-24 16:46:34 Perhaps we should continue transporting oil via rail? Pipelines are safer,
9737 2018-02-24 16:46:32 Tanzania is not an oil producing nation, but there is petrol in all the stations I’ve seen in Dar Es Salaam and Zanzibar. No queue nationwide according to my investigations. Nigeria is Africa’s top oil producer and as I speak there are fuel queues in different parts of Nigeria.
9738 2018-02-24 16:46:27 Longest-serving rulers—Teodoro Obiang Nguema of Equatorial Guinea, José Eduardo dos Santos of Angola, Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, and
Paul Biya of Cameroon—each preside over an African state rich in oil or minerals. Between them they have ruled for 136 years
9739 2018-02-24 16:46:18 Um......I know a lot of women who have done the "ingest placenta after birth" thing in some form or another. Which to each their own....but other people's placentas?

9762 2018-02-24 16:42:31 I've been at Jiffy Lube for an hour and a half waiting for an oil change. Only two cars were in front of me, and they were both being worked on as I pulled in.... Nbd I just need to be somewhere at 11 
9763 2018-02-24 16:42:31 Not if it’s called “essential oil”.
9764 2018-02-24 16:42:27 Takde tulis “oil” pun. Hahaha. Thanks memang lama nak try origins ni. Tapi tak tau apa yang bagus. Maybe tunggu yang sekarang habis sebab tak pakai rugi skincare boleh expire!

9773 2018-02-24 16:41:33 That is the issue nothing. You know what hurts, when they rub these in our face using God and goodwill.  Except you are related to the gods of Niger Delta or Sango in Delta or Amadioha for the oil regions in the east, there's something fishy. We all know that. She mocked God..

9776 2018-02-24 16:40:58 UCLA Extension has great art classes and not too expensive. I’ve taken everything from math to oil painting there.
9777 2018-02-24 16:40:44 The only reason we deem those countries enemies is because they want to trade oil for gold instead of US dollars. Why do you think our government has defended such an evil regime (Saudi) shortly after we got off gold standard. /2
9778 2018-02-24 16:40:35 She worked in a bank for 12 years before going into fashion and many years before oil. How is that all within a decade?
9779 2018-02-24 16:40:33 It's Saturday. World oil markets still open. $DAL trades in oil as it also is the only airlines with its own refineries. Their buisness model is one if the best in their space.

9787 2018-02-24 16:40:01 The pharma lobby does not represent people who take prescription meds. The ag lobby doesn't rep people who eat salad. The oil lobby doesn't rep people who drive cars. And the NRA doesn't represent gun owners. The purpose of the NRA is to help gunmakers sell more guns.

9789 2018-02-24 16:39:48 The story of the brutal torture TPLF inflicted on these & other political prisoners must come out.

9827 2018-02-24 16:35:07 not a bit. It's just that ignoring the GHG forcings and claiming all the warming could come from some obscure stochastic processes and hidden mechanics is like buying snake oil , or turkey milk, or believing the moon is made of cheese (like AFAIK Dr. Nikolov does)

9836 2018-02-24 16:33:53 ‘Despite being Africas largest oil exporter, a lack of local refineries means Nigeria has to import petroleum products. With the state oil company unable to solely handle imports & distribution.. the countrys supply is reliant on independent marketers who can import & distribute’
9837 2018-02-24 16:33:40 Canada used to have a crown corporation for oil & gas called Petro Canada, but our neoliberal duopoly privatized. I believe that was a mistake. I would be far more inclined to support oil sands development if it benefitted all Canadians, instead of just the oil barons & employees
9838 2018-02-24 16:33:38 Glad you acknowledge it's a real problem. Global impacts are already widely documented.Keep in mind decades and centuries are very short time periods geologically speaking to observe change. Main risk of having funding cut is from oil friendly govt's like Trump and Trudeau.

Are some faiths more equal than others? Abuja, I believe, help my unbelief!

9864 2018-02-24 16:30:29 Most rich people never tell you the truth. All of them claim hardwork and faith. Faith cannot lead you to get oil block, be truthful. Somebody somewhere pushed you irrespective of anything you must have done to merit it.

9875 2018-02-24 16:29:44 RB, for your information, 15 years ago, palm oil was being tested for use in providing cheaper engine fuel. Indonesia had over 200 taxis under test. The production technology was the “Achilles heel”. High production cost. But who knows with advancing technology?

9883 2018-02-24 16:28:42 As a student of the Bible, I read and learned the exploits of faith by our forebears in Hebrews 11. None of them acquired oil blocs through faith!  So those of us queuing at the filling stations across the country for 1litre of fuel don't have faith, àbí? OK, now. Kontinue.

9900 2018-02-24 16:27:00 The easiest sources of oil have already been tapped, which is why unconventional sources like bitumen have been explored. The world's sinks, global climate, and rapidly growing renewables will be the limiting factors on future oilsands growth.Pipelines will outlive their product.

9933 2018-02-24 16:22:58 Yes the US is hostile towards them, but they also have the largest oil reserves on Earth. Even with sanctions, under a normal market they should be fine trading with Russia and China. Instead they nationalized their largest industry, thus their economy collapsed.

9961 2018-02-24 16:20:39 We need to unplug America and plug it back in, hold the reset button, put it in rice, refresh it, give it an update, give it some herbal tea and coconut oil, rub some Vick’s vapor rub on it and bang the back of it to make it work again, because it’s a mess.

9968 2018-02-24 16:20:13 Nah! We are not dragging her for receiving oil well. We drag her cos she ain’t saying the truth. Which one is “I was a Millionaire & God made me rich”? Smh. Aunty should sit

9979 2018-02-24 16:18:52 the worst part of having eczema is actually not the constantly irritated skin, it’s having every girl who does crystal healing tell me to put some coconut oil black mud bee pollen concoction on my face bc it will “totally cure it!”
9980 2018-02-24 16:18:51 Hey, I’m prepared to wrestle anyone naked in a kiddies paddling pool filled with olive oil for that merch

9985 2018-02-24 16:18:27 I wasn't sure it *was* icing sugar cos everything else I found was cornflour. And you need oil as well. But it hasn't worked anyway (see IG).
9986 2018-02-24 16:18:25 Not everyone who believes a religion is duped.There is a huge difference between spirituality of many sorts that often comes from great thinkers, eg. Ghandi,Martin Luther King, Boenhoffer, and snake oil cultism spread by false prophets.I think we should stop conflating the two.

9991 2018-02-24 16:18:09 Talking to a friend of mine about medical benefits of cannabis oil.
‘Yeah, I hear ODB oil is really good stuff’

9992 2018-02-24 16:18:08 Waitn on an oil change...
9993 2018-02-24 16:17:50 I can’t believe this woman actually replied you people because I don’t get the backlash really. 
Are you angry she got the oil bloc or that she doesn’t talk about seemingly important topics in her interviews because from where I stand, she’s a hero.
9994 2018-02-24 16:17:49 Why do we have to pay for the mercenaries to protect the oil shouldnt the oil companies pay
9995 2018-02-24 16:17:48 Yes lets unravel decades of religious dogma because we're running out of oil wealth. Release the women!
9996 2018-02-24 16:17:45 Gonna be a busy fucking day. Oil Change, Mobile Home hunting, Diaper party, Crawfish Boil then Tejano Saturday shhhiiiiitttt
9997 2018-02-24 16:17:40 That would be a much safer solution and we've heard so much about the benefits oil and other products have had on sick people.

10002 2018-02-24 16:17:11 If you’re wondering why the 2nd floor of Herrig smells like flowers, I accidentally spilled my new bamboo oil diffuser. Oops...
10003 2018-02-24 16:17:07 Such jaw dropping BS from Snake Oil Salesman Trump.The depth of his ignorance is breath taking
No where in the World are teachers asked to arm themselves to protect their classrooms. Rather than get to the root cause of mass shootings Trump vomits the usual rhetoric. DISGUSTING
10004 2018-02-24 16:17:03 "China currently imports around 70 percent of the oil it uses. By 2030, that figure is expected to reach 80 percent. Meanwhile, the United States will likely become a net exporter of oil and natural gas by the 2030s, if not sooner."
10005 2018-02-24 16:17:03 But let's keep building the coal industry and putting our heads up our assess by cutting resources to alternative energy, line the pockets of trump buddies in the oil and gas industry while defying the wrath of global warming
10006 2018-02-24 16:16:48 ลืมเอาครีมทาหน้ากับoil in serum มา แงงง มีแต่น้ำตบ คือไม่ชุ่มชื่นไงสุดท้ายบีบอายครีมมาทาทั่วหน้า ==*
10007 2018-02-24 16:16:46 eLDee's thread is shaking a table with an oil block and faith on it .
10008 2018-02-24 16:16:45 When you get out a new roll of toilet paper, place a few drops of your favorite essential oil in the cardboard tube of the toilet paper.
10009 2018-02-24 16:16:25 Oh wow I would love to #win a #Gold #Oil Essence Amber & Argan Bi-Phase Conditioner 
10010 2018-02-24 16:16:23 Put some mct oil into coffee this morning. Hoping my body reacts... Nicely to it.
10011 2018-02-24 16:16:21 My mama been using coconut oil, soap, and water on her skin for 67 years and doesnt have a wrinkle or blemish in sight. MEANWHILE that shit would eat my skin alive

10013 2018-02-24 16:16:08 Hahahaha. No we can’t. Not even close. Fuck we can’t even get our oil to the east via pipeline. On by train so that towns in qc can be blown up
10014 2018-02-24 16:16:00 With due respect Ma, I would have remained silent. An “unwanted” oil block that you were “allocated” & accepted “by faith”? If I were you, I would acknowledge my privilege & move on & help others. There’s nothing wrong with privilege. As long as you don’t paint it as yours.
10015 2018-02-24 16:15:36 Who put all that egg in my oil....

10019 2018-02-24 16:14:51 Probably. So would not having to have an oil change today
10020 2018-02-24 16:14:49 Ran them bitches outta oil
10021 2018-02-24 16:14:49 I dont see why people get so mad at people using coconut oil on their face. If it WORKS for them and keeps their skin nice what does it matter? Not everyone is the same. I think that’s the problem with Twitter skincare advice. It assumes everyone is one size fits all.

10026 2018-02-24 16:14:23 Gun advocates remind me of the people who speak at marijuana rallies. You know, the pot advocates who tell you legalizing weed will cure cancer, end dependence on foreign oil, etc.
For gun advocates, the anwer to everything is arming more citizens [selling more guns]
10027 2018-02-24 16:14:12 Last time I looked, trump and GOP have been solid in LA. It's the leftists who want to keep you from drowning. Stop drinking the oil based water down there. It's truly affecting your brains. Best have a few pair of hip waders ready. You are going to need them. BTW U R the swamp!

10034 2018-02-24 16:13:21 "In the decades following the Standard Oil breakup, antitrust enforcement generally abided by a core principle: When a company grows so powerful that it becomes a gatekeeper, and uses that might to undermine competitors, then the government should intervene." NYT Magazine
10035 2018-02-24 16:12:55 Thanks so much, Where do I get this oil?

10037 2018-02-24 16:12:28 I wonder how long before the oil and gas conglomerates do venture into space...
10038 2018-02-24 16:12:28 Heard it on the $ tight. If you know what works for you (essential oil wise) you can usually add a combination of up to 30 drops of essential oils to a ounce of oil. Or you can combine the herb in vodka and make a tincture that you can rub on your skin.
