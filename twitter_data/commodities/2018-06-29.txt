1 2018-06-30 23:50:39 I'd agree apart from "human capitol". I don't see much improvement there from commodities. 

I've never been part of a union, but I liked it being there in case I needed it.
2 2018-06-30 23:47:20 I agree that they should exist - but I think organizations should do what they can to prevent them from earning membership from their employees. What can organizations do to prevent unions? They can treat their workers like human capital instead of human commodities.

9 2018-06-30 22:37:52 Uhhh what?

There is no monopoly on violence or arbitration in a stateless society. When left to their own devices, human beings generally trade commodities and form economic relationships. So in a state of anarchy, society ends up looking a lot like free market capitalism.
10 2018-06-30 22:36:39 Let's make it clear. Ownership = static value. Revenue = income made from commodities. Only labor can increase the value of a commodity, so only labor can create revenue. Profit = revenue - expense. To simply, Profit = surplus value from labor. This is not that hard.
11 2018-06-30 22:34:29 I'm not saying trade for Miller, someone similar to him that isn't broken down. Lefties are commodities in baseball Noah. Trust me, Wilson and Duensing can't be the best the Cubs can and should settle for if they want to make a run at the Brewers and further.

13 2018-06-30 22:12:19 No one said "middle class", it was said too poor to live. You are correct in terms of energy consumption, but in regards to food, other commodities, and consumer products the US wastes more than is required to provide for most of the world poorest people.
14 2018-06-30 21:45:36 Of course since then the popular front govt benefited from both a president w an odd amount of integrity & humility, and the mid-aughts commodities boom. I also have the impression they punch above their weight in Spanish language tech & media

47 2018-06-30 20:32:50 Simple. First defaults/asset deflation and then inflation via oil/other commodities/war will be the answer. It always has been, always will be...
48 2018-06-30 20:24:52 re: "rampant inflation"  That's what my knee jerk reaction is with the growing socialism in the US.  "Free Stuff" = US dollar falling and commodities headed higher.  Inflation of course impacting the poor over the wealthy that own assets.

50 2018-06-30 20:15:18 I have often wondered this myself; moreso given the question of what becomes of FED Res after arrest. Can we continue using dollar, or will we need to go back to domestic currency and produce all of our own commodities again while we rebuild

59 2018-06-30 19:20:47 Arg es un país que exporta bienes primarios. Una devaluación en un país que exporta commodities no varía la productividad, ya que a quienes vendes no van a comprar más porque sea más barato. El chancho que come soja en China va a comer la misma cantidad, consumo constante.

64 2018-06-30 18:43:40 I mean why should the whole world abide by US sanctions on Iran just cause Mr. Trump believes that JCPOA is bad n scraps a  International agreement thru @UN As an Indian I ask.. Can you provide the Oil & other commodities that we get from Iran at the same price and insurance?
65 2018-06-30 18:34:24 Depending on what numbers you believe China may have taken over the world. China is stocking piling natural commodities from around the world. Once you have all the commodities you control the world. Everyone has to buy from you.
66 2018-06-30 18:34:21 this will be a hyperinflationary winter, not deflationary, as the banks will make sure.

74 2018-06-30 17:58:50 Interests rates are up, the tariffs imposed are bad for American farmers and distributors of major commodities and the stock market is soon to crash worse than 2008.

79 2018-06-30 17:37:56 Step 1: women are not commodities and their body parts are not for sale for sexual gratification or reproductive expedience.

88 2018-06-30 16:59:13 Violent up/downs in a developing economy dependent on commodities export will have those cycles, the long trend is still real, If Brazil dropped the tariffs on industrial products the flow of capital would be huge, now they just protect corporate national interests.
89 2018-06-30 16:57:57 Rulings against a religion and labor, not good. GDP going down w/tariffs. Stock values going down, commodities prices increasing. Jobs not as good as with Obama. Wages are not increasing. NK is still enhancing their nuclear capabilities. Go ahead, I’m waiting.
90 2018-06-30 16:42:09 India is not free market, not yet anyway.
What I observed is hotels that charged under 14% Vat charged more when GST for service was 18% but all commodities were in 0-5%.
Even after the service slab was 5% they don't bring prices down.

93 2018-06-30 16:30:08 Technically, capitalism is amoral.  It is the recognition of the fungibility of commodities, including capital.  What people do with that can be moral or immoral, but capitalists favor morality, since cheating loses business.

95 2018-06-30 16:19:52 In a war #commodities are going to be the premium and the #USD will be trash. Trump will try, but there is no peace coming. Soon people will see the grim reality. Sanctions being placed on Iran to create instability and an uprising, but will lead to war.
96 2018-06-30 16:15:10 Except the country and the assets ... Canada for example is super rich in commodities and that is what helps to back the CAD. When commodity prices go up so does the CAD. Crypto currencies have zero to back them ZERO!

115 2018-06-30 13:54:17 Exactly. That's why I'm short-mid term (at least)bearish on gold. People always say that gold is naturally deflationary because it is limited supply, but okay...other commodities (which have direct use hence the name) like oil are also deflationary to a point.

121 2018-06-30 13:20:33 WE KNOW!!!   It's dirty, disgusting, & horrendous BUT it must be said!  Our most precious vulnerable members of society are traded&sold like commodities!! BIG BUSINESS  Valuable dead or alive, body parts sold, organ donors, used for rituals!! Not traveling with families! WAKE UP!
122 2018-06-30 13:19:51 I would promote the claim of $45 million losses to the Taliban from “not credible” to “fantastical”. Tax is typically 1% of value on commodities-diesel, wheat, marble, talc &opiates. Were it as much as claimed there’d be “good Taliban”, “bad Taliban” &plenty of “Gucci Taliban”!
123 2018-06-30 13:19:04 The inert gold theorists big claim is that gold is tied to commodities. When is gold going to catch up with oil ? Gold stocks made all time lows with oil at $40.

125 2018-06-30 13:11:20 Prices TO high. Does that mean higher prices?  Or did your Dementia not tell you difference between too & to? In any case you wouldn’t be doing this if you weren’t getting something out of it.  You don’t care that the rising prices on gas & other commodities are hurting Americans
126 2018-06-30 12:58:54 Relieved of our necessity to respond to global trade alliances, loaded with commodities, our future does not lie with our current masters. We’ll be fine.

130 2018-06-30 12:34:07 Today seen s one crude chart where if previous two tops r joined then crude is near resistance and it just needed a news to materialise. Anyways, I am mot trading commodities nor regularly chart follower of it so this is just observation.

132 2018-06-30 11:50:25 The U.S. Paper Base Currency is not linked to the Commodities Market: Gold, Silver, Crude Oil, and Natural Gas!
133 2018-06-30 11:44:55 Yeah I read that letter but read it mostly to apply to ICOs and answer the question of how those tokens start out as securities then seem to magically transform into commodities. I know it’s clear the SEC and the CFTC are working together but to me that doesn’t bar 1 from action
134 2018-06-30 11:40:29 The decriminalization of marijuana would be better than any tax cut that our government could give me I could be legally self-sufficient in this country and the benefit to North Carolina would be billions of dollars in tax revenue marijuana is the most valuable of commodities
135 2018-06-30 11:36:24 As always, your extra points are “on point”! Unfortunately, tolerance and mutual respect are becoming rare commodities nowadays. Be safe and keep up the good work!
136 2018-06-30 11:36:19 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
137 2018-06-30 11:33:26 The two heavyweight champions of the world aren't big enough names yet for them to step in the ring now.... The sport might wanna think about closing up shop if the 2 baddest men on the planet aren't big enough commodities yet. They've been champs for quite a while now. Pathetic!
138 2018-06-30 11:29:18 When was last time you looked at oil price volatile commodities go up as well as down
139 2018-06-30 11:19:39 Thanks - my point is we can’t just sight Oil or similar commodities to mention inflation. You would be lying!
140 2018-06-30 11:07:23 Is there anything the Clintons did or touched that didn't end up being corrupt? Think: Women abused, Clinton Foundation, DOJ, Commodities Market, Real Estate, Russia investigation, Top Secret Security Breach, Democratic Party, Mark Rich, etc. The last goes on and on.

142 2018-06-30 10:58:38 A lo mejor si no hubiera llovido tendríamos precio cero... 
La subida del resto de las commodities (Brent, EUAs, Gas, Carbón) tal vez hayan influido más que el aumento de las reservas. Además, no es lo mismo q llueva en enero q en mayo.

146 2018-06-30 10:44:33 Kapag umabot ng 5 percent ang inflation. Lilipat na ako ng Baguio. Doon kahit ano mangyari mura ang basic commodities bukod sa gasolina. E wala naman akong sasakyan at pwede lakarin lahat ng lugar. Doon nalang ako.
147 2018-06-30 10:36:32 Focusing on the commodities seems narrow Chris. Like saying you should stay with your abusive husband 'cos he brings home a salary. Would be useful to have a post consisting of additional angles e.g. legal implications / self-determinism / EU reform?
148 2018-06-30 10:31:07 Theresa May's post-exit plan for the U.K. appears to envisage free trade with "the continent" in commodities, but not human beings (i.e. service providers).
149 2018-06-30 10:04:53 Biosev SA, the Brazilian sugar and ethanol producer controlled by commodities trader Louis Dreyfus, said on Friday that Juan José Blanchard will replace Rui Chammas as its chief executive, according to a securities filing.

150 2018-06-30 09:43:23 I read a thread on a forum where there were lots of feminists saying openly how wrong it was for rich white men to buy a woman's womb. There are plenty of feminists who despise this treatment of women as commodities.

157 2018-06-30 07:56:59 GST is one of that tax which the nation wanted for years.
From which aspect GST had failed?
One nation one tax theory is helpful for the common people in reducing the prices of basic commodities.

161 2018-06-30 07:16:11      Mercury is so expensive, who would agree to waste it in sugar (cane)? Logically it doesn't add up, but socially assuming its really there then we are doomed as a nation. I wonder if sugar could be having such metals what about other basic commodities?

166 2018-06-30 06:22:20 FA strategy will be interesting. Playing the long game may be advantageous. Market (in)efficiencies will leave many quality FAs with below market deals relative to their equatable value while some rare valuable commodities in this FA e.g. FVV will be overpaid.

170 2018-06-30 06:07:58 That would be a good startup, I am questioning their tax exempt usage of a Tax-Free VISA Charge Card that they obtain discounted commodities & merchandise that never is accounted for ever again after those taxes are written off as non-payable.
171 2018-06-30 05:51:25 And still you know nothing about the struggle of the local, the hardship they face,  the less opportunity to earn, the nil infrastructure, the basic commodities they pay with the double rate from mainland, travel miles to get education and still the like of you call privilege!!!!

By 2025 a new system will have been implemented, rates will be much higher & commodities will be in major bull mkt.
176 2018-06-30 05:07:44 $oil is a different beast. More connected to governments and currency than equities and other commodities.

It's been unprofitable for them for too long
177 2018-06-30 04:51:15 1/2 The flaw with this approach given by Nash is that the supply of money would still have to be fluid in order to stabilize prices of the basket of goods/commodities...
178 2018-06-30 04:43:13 When all the Govt companies raise price of the commodities to pay dividends to Govt, you may pay less tax but your pocket will have many holes

Real Interest Rates still negative, for how long?
180 2018-06-30 03:41:49 If you’re a college athlete that’s about what you deserve. And let’s be honest, athletes are provided with better commodities than that amount anyways. As shown in the video.
181 2018-06-30 03:14:00 2/2 Chi has some good food, but no activities to burn that shit off so it seems like there are a ton of fat people. Pretty much every city of comparable size has much better stuff to offer in terms or art and culture. Chicago’s economy is also very one dimensional on commodities
182 2018-06-30 03:08:59 crude will touch $100 this year. 
new rich people will be evolving around commodities in this era
183 2018-06-30 02:31:41 Those aren't commodities or means of production; they're public goods. That you can't tell the difference is just one reason why this always ends in mass starvation and genocide.
184 2018-06-30 02:12:57 With all due respect sirs, this administration is fast becoming good at commiseration visits rather than being proactive in averting these menace. Sir, i wish your administration will adopt the Safety Policies being used in Developed countries in handling Highrisk commodities.
185 2018-06-30 02:07:32 Even if tax breaks help a little, the tariffs will kill them and drop the price of commodities that were going overseas
186 2018-06-30 02:00:31 11-year old girl. A year shy from sitting UPSR. Who in their right mind would allow such arrangement in the first place? Girls are not commodities, to be traded off. Allow them to grow, to enjoy life and to be educated. #BanChildMarriage
187 2018-06-30 01:53:06 On Canada Day let’s rethink the Canadian TrumpTariff response. They the USA are taxing/tariffing commodities. Canada should respond by taxing USA information news and tech services. Start with Fox Cable, Facebook, Google, Apple Computers, NewYork Post, Disney, CBS , NBC  etc.
188 2018-06-30 01:50:49 I can prove it. Only if you challenge it. TA works 99% of the time in commodities and forex. In crypto it works only with top coins. What do I mean by TA works ?

I mean the prices follow technical levels. Let me know what is your understanding of “TA WORKS”
189 2018-06-30 01:35:56 Some things work better socialized. Look at utilities, look at medicine. If you treat organs like any other commodities you’ll wind up selling them at auction to millionaires instead of using them where they do the most good.
190 2018-06-30 01:34:52 Religion aside. My point is Roe v Wade was not something @SCOTUS should have judged on. There is something called 10th Amendment. Another argument would be a persons right to live.  Healthcare and other commodities are rights but not life #abortiondebate #abortionismurder
191 2018-06-30 01:34:43 Todavía tienen el comodín del gobierno anterior, pero se les va a acabar pronto. No hemos dado un paso firme hacia las nuevas tecnologías mientras el resto del mundo se automatiza y propone bienestar, nosotros los extractores de commodities vamos hacia abajo.
192 2018-06-30 01:24:31 And like 2019 when people thought they were diversified by owning stocks, bonds and commodities.
193 2018-06-30 01:14:36 Why doesn't this work with any of our other commodities Dave? Whats the difference between wheat and beef?
194 2018-06-30 01:12:09 And Canada’s Soy Producers wishes to thank #AgolfTweetler. Our Soy commodities are soaring!
195 2018-06-30 00:50:43 In developed countries, underground pipes and trains carry such commodities on routes that aren't commercial or residential. My word is simple - youth AWAKE! There will be TROUBLE in 2019.
196 2018-06-30 00:50:01 A rise of wages from this cause will, indeed, be invariably accompanied by a rise in the price of commodities; but in such cases, it will be found that labour and all commodities have not varied in regard to each other, and that the variation has been confined to money.
197 2018-06-30 00:40:39 If the system cost of that system can provide the commodities at least social cost, at the given specific location, I completely agree.
198 2018-06-30 00:38:42 @MariaBartiromo they’re acquiring &exporting sensitive commodities to China.Where are Fox invest journos.What’sCGasparino’s job description?
199 2018-06-30 00:37:25 On the other hand, the commodities that build renewable energy are obtained from the extraction of free air or underground such as coal. Maybe the miners who now extract coal tomorrow extract transition metals. Terminator, you don’t gain anything by killing miners
200 2018-06-30 00:32:59 Question. As @POTUS champions for the 1% of the 10% ...your future is in commodities. Porcelain toilets. #tariff

203 2018-06-30 00:01:19 And well I get fundamentals shouldny hold a view in vol trading . I would interject , on call skew based commodities i need at least x% of the crop growing (unknown) to buy that ticket . Otherwise by time a finally hit i got so many losing tickets . I just wash
204 2018-07-01 23:52:20 It has pros and cons, but As of this time, lalong tataas ang inflation rate.. weak peso will mean, higher oil prices (since ang ginagamit nating pag bili ng oil ay dollar).. this will mean higher prices of basic commodities..

241 2018-07-01 21:22:07 Es así. El Edo administrador-distribuidor estaba destinado a convertirse en padre benefactor. Depender exclusivamente de la explotación del petróleo, además,no haber diversificado la producción nos amarró en todos los sentidos al subdesarrollo,a vivir de la renta de commodities.
242 2018-07-01 21:15:56 I agree. Also BTC v. OIL and other commodities.
243 2018-07-01 21:06:01 Lefafa so called journalists.stigma on journalism.For sale commodities,can accomdate on daily basis depending upon the price.neven seen cheap mafia within media fr protection of most corrupt so called politicians in the world. Defending corrupt is worst then corruption committed
244 2018-07-01 21:05:22 That's fine. But my original point was that Covington and Saric aren't unknown commodities.
245 2018-07-01 20:52:18 It may be exceedingly obvious, but you know what's great about the T9? The cargo space. 712t I'm carrying... I'm picking up so many "industry needs X" missions, and completing them all in one visit it's amazing. Carrying 13 separate commodities ATM, making about cr30m an hour.
246 2018-07-01 20:48:46 Schmeichel and Subasic were already known commodities coming into the WC.
247 2018-07-01 20:41:55 Ideologies are not scarce, and therefore are not commodities. Labor is a commodity
248 2018-07-01 20:35:13 Getting a woman is not the same as attracting a woman - women are not commodities and are perfectly capable of saying no to a repugnant rich man just as much as they are of saying no to a repugnant poor man

FAME/WEALTH DO NOT GIVE MEN THE RIGHT TO GRAB WOMEN
249 2018-07-01 20:32:54 Tá bom, Capitão América. Os livros estão errados... A I e II Guerra na verdade não são uma guerra entre potências bélicas por commodities: petróleo, ferro, madeira, ouro. Na verdade é a luta do BEM contra o MAL.
250 2018-07-01 20:32:43 Couldn’t we say the same about iPhone components: all are commodities? Just as Apple focused on user experience, that seems Tesla’s advantage if they have one
251 2018-07-01 20:29:33 Sir, correct me if wrong. A few years BJP leaders used to say that ~90% of indirect tax collections come from some 50/60 commodities. So can't the government only tax such commodities and remove tax on all other goods?
252 2018-07-01 20:29:03 Commodities
253 2018-07-01 20:28:34 Le dio cierta estabilidad aunque tuvo inflación al inicio. Ecuador exporta muchas commodities. No se como funcionaría en una economía "grande y diversificada" como la argentina.
254 2018-07-01 20:24:52 Someone is playing stocks and shares with the players at Bath; gambling on them as if they were tradable commodities. If it fails, it means we’re over-stacked and beyond the cap. Like now.
255 2018-07-01 20:11:34 Haha - illustrates that physical beauty alone is not enough; needs to be accompanied by intelligence and wit. These things seem to be scarce commodities on #LoveIsIand
256 2018-07-01 20:11:01 There are more jobs than people to take them, wages are growing ahead of inflation, PDI is booming, the middle class is taking home more pay, the prices of basic commodities are plummeting, etc.
Life is very, very good for Americans.
257 2018-07-01 20:00:44 Riley Nash and Tim Schaller at slightly under 5 million combined or today’s forward pickups? I’m definitely going with the proven commodities.
258 2018-07-01 20:00:19 It has everything to do with it and you know it!! The feds are giving illegals choice of where they want to go.. And naturally they will pick large cities where all the resources and commodities are! How about saying NO!!!!! Let the feds make the provisions not the city.
259 2018-07-01 19:58:25 I can see the Town of Sweet Roll now. Where sweet rolls are prized above all commodities, the guards are of the finest assholes of Skyrim and is a major Thieves Guild HUD.
260 2018-07-01 19:56:52 Plus, they have no clue as how to best use they vast stockpiles of youth talent they have Accumulated, apart from using them as human trafficking commodities to be sold in the market.
261 2018-07-01 19:52:08 Não existem heróis, meu caro. Todos lutaram desesperadamente por si. Quem tem armas e melhor tecnologia domina quem tem menos tecnologia. Deixa de purismo. É assim até hoje: guerras por commodities. Vocês e essas releituras estúpidas.
262 2018-07-01 19:51:39 They think it's free.  Someone needs to tell them they will be paying for all through taxes and commodities....like Canada.  That's why the Canadian's come to the US.  They pick up big ticket items here because it's so much cheaper.
263 2018-07-01 19:51:31 Isn’t it apparent there is a trade disparity if Canada fights steel and aluminum (hard commodities) tariffs with tariffs on ketchup and lawn mowers? And Europe with blue jeans, almonds, and Jack Daniels?
264 2018-07-01 19:42:59 subvert those commodities AND strengthen yr brand by addin. "goth-" to each of them
265 2018-07-01 19:39:58 Joy, its called the need for civil servants who WORK for American citizens and do the right thing.  No more lying, cheating, theiving treasonist' who propagate riots & hate, sell commodities to foreign powers and place us in the path of danger and then smuggly give us the bird!
266 2018-07-01 19:39:38 Forget about different rates for different commodities. First of all tell us why have you imposed GST ? After taking from us IT and  Profession Tax why should you again take Service Tax from us ? Goods Tax which was previously known as VAT/ST was collected by the State Gov.
267 2018-07-01 19:39:19 Indeed he made a fortune off currencies and commodities but has nothing to do w/ Spurs.
268 2018-07-01 19:37:17 The US dollar extended Friday’s losses amid mixed economic data and trade tensions. Equities and commodities were slightly firmer.
269 2018-07-01 19:27:25 Canada was selling mostly commodities to the US in exchange for value-added products sold by the US. The US will lose more jobs per $ of trade. 
Canada can sell commodities on the international market. Wrong choice by Trump.
270 2018-07-01 19:25:48 Though arguably all but domain knowledge and communication are commodities...Domain knowledge takes time + immersive experience...Communication is hard-to-teach emotional intelligence...
271 2018-07-01 19:22:37 You know there was wage labour and commodities in the USSR no?
272 2018-07-01 19:22:34 Yes, silver typically follows oil. For one, higher production cost to manufacture like all other commodities. I think the reason silver and other commodities didnt respond to the oil move over the last two weeks was due to options expirations and the end of Q2.
273 2018-07-01 18:50:45 Yea then I don’t know. Maybe they are gonna trade 9. I don’t know what return gonna be heck the price was a good Saad contract a year ago w a bonus year last year for us. Or even Bob as trade. Our top commodities are 8,3 both top 8 in league. Could u imagine breaking up?
274 2018-07-01 18:47:40 Interesting question. Big money does buy the airtime ads, but lower income folks buy the commodities advertized.

We know what broadcasters care about. But what does this mean average TV watchers care more about? Ads or programming?
275 2018-07-01 18:45:30 Stop hedgies and speculators inflating the price of commodities and services and make them take jobs that have some social worth instead?
276 2018-07-01 18:40:30 @KTNKenya The only thing Jubilee government has achieved is major corruption scandals!!!The youth are suffering from severe unemployment, people are dying in hospitals and prices for basic commodities are beyond reach for common mwananchi!!!
277 2018-07-01 18:36:08 #ForRecordSake
PM Modi says thus: "Can we have milk and Mercedes at the same rate? So, when our friends in Congress say that they will have just one GST rate, they are effectively saying they will tax food items and commodities, which are currently at zero or 5%, at 18%.”
278 2018-07-01 18:35:37 Bang on. Archibald forgot what got him a contract by season end. Really don’t get why so many think he’s an option. Beagle and Roussel are huge upgrades in grit and hard work areas. Great examples for the kids, and tradeable commodities come playoff time.
279 2018-07-01 18:22:35 please merge slab 18% into 12%
and 28% slab reduce to 20%.
i am sure revenue will be increased.
some commodities are evasion prone.
this our experience.

280 2018-07-01 18:21:01 I am concerned about higher prices for gherkins and toilet paper, however.  These are both essential commodities ;-)
281 2018-07-01 18:11:13 He started his working life in the London Metals Exchange as a commodities trader, so I think we can assume he understood shorting and quite probably carried it out regularly.
282 2018-07-01 18:09:08 Put tax or not see the result petrol rs 80 /l and price of all essential commodities touching to sky that is killing to common man.
283 2018-07-01 18:01:54 Eso significaría que el pueblo prefiere vivir de rodillas mientras tenga sus commodities aseguradas. Si verdaderamente somos unos revolucionarios de sofá no nos merecemos nuestro propio país. Personalmente creo que va por aquí el tema de erc. Pero repito, no sabemos que se cuece.
284 2018-07-01 17:44:28 @terryoinfluence I would love to hear a show about how generic food commodities are marketed (eg: potatoes, rice, corn, beef, chicken, fish).  We eat them all the time in huge volumes but don't see adds for them, unless they are turned into ingredients.
285 2018-07-01 17:26:13 I mean a 1st round pick and 2 unproven commodities landed Jimmy Butler. Not the same ceiling as Kawhi but Cov/Saric/Smith/21 1st is already a much better package than the Bulls got (yes, I’m a Bulls fan). Idk tho maybe Fultz tips the scales and he benefits from change of scenery.
286 2018-07-01 17:19:55 Our policy makers are busy creating import windows kaka so as to import commodities that'll make them billionaires overnight.
287 2018-07-01 17:02:50 The wealth of those societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails, presents itself as "an immense accumulation of commodities," its unit being a single commodity.
288 2018-07-01 16:54:56 All humans end up dead. You treat vegetables like commodities from the time they're seedlings.
289 2018-07-01 16:53:44 Mr Chidambaram,it's our version of1country 1tax.Goods tax on commodities @5/12/18pc, then Service tax@28 on serving d food utilising these taxed commodities. That too as cgst,sgst/igst @rates ranging from 0.25/3/5/12/18/28pc.Our ministers have innovative brains which u don't have
290 2018-07-01 16:51:54 And lol at raised humanely.  They all end up dead how is that humane they're considered objects and commodities before they're even born what about that is humane

It is our backwardness that unemployment, price rising of commodities make us harass!
We aren't NPA-wala like chhota Modi& Mehool Bhai !
Oil & Gas must be merged with GST.
179.6 million Indians are poor.194.6 million are Hungers.
It is not Celebration time!
292 2018-07-01 16:21:36 Mr.President of Bharat & Finance Minister,

Why Oil & Gas can not be merged with GST?!
Are you taking Pro-Nirav position?!
Aam-Indian has no NPA like chhota Modi&Mehool Bhai of BADA Modi !
Why are you exploiting them!?
Unemployment,Price-Rising of commodities make us backward.
293 2018-07-01 16:16:06 Usa actually has legislation barring government officials from using their position to play the market.  

Trump the wunderkind--instead of news on what we are doing in Syria, we get stock and commodities tips on oil.  Oh the insanity?
294 2018-07-01 16:14:12 Building consensus is Modi Jis job as PM of the country. Just blaming states won't help. If he has done it for all other commodities then he can do it for petroleum products too.
295 2018-07-01 16:14:02 Why does man see other animals as nothing more than commodities? Simply tools to be used abused and discarded?
296 2018-07-01 16:08:27 Your fear of life without drugs leads you to fear a future without capitalist commodities.
297 2018-07-01 16:05:16 Did you know, the "My Account" page allows you to easily track your orders against grants, budgets, commodities, labs, professors, etc.

Can someone publish a fact sheet on

2. Reduction in price of all essential commodities
3. Reduction in filing paperwork
4. %Reduction in daily items 
5. Real estate petrol diesel stamp duties ?
301 2018-07-01 15:57:01 The media institutions have this thing about publishing news commodities: sensationalism no matter how harmful is profitable. more clicks etc. They could contest these ideas but they claim to report demonstrably wrong facts and call it news. #GhMediaRev

304 2018-07-01 15:43:10 Not to ignore the inflationary effect it would have if essential commodities are taxed in the same bracket as luxury goods.

Would be extremely stupid of the govt to not extract more taxes on few of the "luxury goods" especially items where there's low price elasticity.

306 2018-07-01 15:35:40 Define “bears.”

Only bears that matter are the ones that buy $BTC short contracts. Those contracts could be invalidated by regulators below $5800. Futures commodities must have at least $100B total market cap.

309 2018-07-01 15:13:09 Can you tell me what’s going to happen when illegals aren’t there as cheap labor? Why don’t you talk about the companies that employ them to give all of you cheaper commodities? Are you willing to pay what it would cost to get a lettuce on your table from a full wage worker?
310 2018-07-01 15:10:22 Discussing about Jubilee can't help us, let them tell us how to know sugar and other commodities that have Mercury and other metals. We are tired as a Nation.
311 2018-07-01 15:05:05 Usually agree with your statements, but this one seems a little premature. Looking at the commodities required for an EV, a complete transfer isn’t achievable, especially with the political situation in the DRC (50% of world’s cobalt supply).
312 2018-07-01 14:54:49 They haven't played 1 NBA game. Have to add known commodities to go along with uncertain ones. I agree on Ayton, it's a toss up as to how guys will turn out after that.
313 2018-07-01 14:53:22 Attention REPUBLICANS....small dairy farmers are giving up. Corporate agriculture running them out of business. Harley davidson. Auto industry. Steel and aluminium. Soy. Food prices . commodities. Gas. 6 million one time pay raise bonus. 345 million Americans. 1 of 2

321 2018-07-01 14:20:15 Well, don’t you have your facts wrong — see German auto exports to US.  China trade balance in dumped commodities, and Canada auto parts and a slew of other stuff.  But enjoy the view from where you are, but this is not about Trump.
322 2018-07-01 14:18:48 Capitalists are only for free movement of commodities. I say 'eff that.' We should be advocating for internationalism.
323 2018-07-01 14:18:39 Im not sure of the best way to pursuade to remove tariffs, but taxing aluminum and steel is not the way to go. Aluminum and steel are input commodities for so many industries that it place an enormous burden on the whole economy (auto manufacturers now have to pay more to operate
324 2018-07-01 14:16:26 And our trade deals have thrown untold numbers off their lands--and our commodities dumping as well
325 2018-07-01 14:08:21 Irony, humor and creativity are rare commodities in that community.
326 2018-07-01 14:03:37 We've never had a true socialist system except in the Nordic countries. Communism is not Socialism. Venezuela is corrupt and reliant on commodities. Not to mention the crippling sanctions of the US...Come on now
327 2018-07-01 14:00:21 I think the two are verry much comparable.  Both “services” bought and sold with money for profit.  PP may not be for profit but the doctor gets paid.....that’s profit performing abortions.  Healthcare is traded on stock market via company, same as coffee.  Both commodities

348 2018-07-01 12:12:57 Do you think it’s right that we resort to seeing it as ‘making use’ of animals - Suggesting that animals are commodities and only good for food?
349 2018-07-01 12:04:38 Doesn't make any sense at all. Luxurious commodities should be taxed higher. It is basic economics for economic equality. You are rich and thus can't see this simple logic that people with more disposable income should pay higher for covering those who can't.

357 2018-07-01 11:15:34 Sir, common people will understand when all essential commodities become cheaper, especially the petroleum products, apart from farmers get max benefits as people will not understand shining India or make in India.
358 2018-07-01 11:10:03 Can't comment for so labelled Brexiters.IMO Problems of #EU Technocracy are.. Monetary Policy & Priorities oversee Social ethos - 4 Freedoms is just misdirection for #EU to solve/disseminate Unemployment crises? (Humans are just more trade commodities) #Brexit #BBCsp
359 2018-07-01 10:29:23 Have 3 slabs as in GST as General, Premium and Luxury with tax rates as 5%,15% & 25%. Essential commodities till certain price points must have 0% tax. Tax filing will become easy. Don't make it a labyrinth.
360 2018-07-01 10:24:34 "Socialism is, by definition, anti-materialism. I, Karl Marx, and certainly no Materialist, by which I mean not using commodities. In fact, I have burned all my clothes and am writing this with my own feces."

- Karl Marx, in a letter to Engels, 1844
361 2018-07-01 10:03:09 Poor consumers in this country have PDS, food security act and essential commodities act. What about farmers? If they don't get enough, how can they buy as consumers? They need purchasing power ...
362 2018-07-01 09:59:05 Does this apply to secondary products or just raw commodities?  For instance are orange juice or orange marmalade given the same tariff treatment as raw oranges. Are we helping Africa develop  its industries or just using them as an EU raw material supplier?
363 2018-07-01 09:47:17 Honourable PM Sir, Few more commodities need to come under 18% from 28 %, which are neither SIN nor luxury. Say Gearbox is one example. There are so many machinery parts.
364 2018-07-01 09:46:35 #Brexit was/is a project for a cushy elite claiming to be "for the people", but is ultimately/mendaciously looking out for itself: Consider the fact that it was led by a former millionaire commodities trader (Farage) and the privileged son of an upper-class  family (Boris).
365 2018-07-01 09:44:31 @INCIndia never said that they will charge all essential commodities at 18%. INC said there shouldn't be any 28% slab rather the cap should be set at 18%.
366 2018-07-01 09:42:18 These are the guys who vowed to return their brains to their god unused, original packaging sort of thing. Not sure there will be any buyers for such commodities.
367 2018-07-01 09:09:20 Can we have milk & Mercedes at the same rate? So, when our friends in Congress say that they will have just one GST rate, they are effectively saying they will tax food items and commodities, which are currently at zero or 5%, at 18%-
368 2018-07-01 09:05:05 As bitcoins introduced in the Trading markets...it challenges the other payment and trading modes..optimists and pessimists, around the globe ,may have different outlooks, depending on the commodities being marketed...
369 2018-07-01 09:03:39 Veganism is about rejecting the animals-as-commodities paradigm and striving to do one's best to avoid exploiting and deliberately inflicting harm on other animal species when doing so can reasonably be avoided. It doesn't assume that ethical perfection is achievable.
370 2018-07-01 08:54:32 Completely arbitrary. You seem caught up in the opinions of last year when you’re fighting for those of the present. Vic has reached that level and will continue to grow and Sabonis will do the same. Ingram and Lonzo have great potential but are still unproven commodities.

380 2018-07-01 07:56:55 Yes, crypto cycles are much faster giving the opportunity to turn profit sooner. That is why, I believe, more and more traditional commodities traders come in to this space. (Silver price consolidation lasted 1.5years ).
381 2018-07-01 07:29:30 On single call of @narendramodi we quit #LPG subsidy what @FinMinIndia had done, price hikes of more than 55, seems we should stop giving #IncomeTax as all the money we earn we just pay on essential living commodities fed up of taxes toll, road, #GST, #petrolpricehike 
382 2018-07-01 07:26:09 When this FBO is done, we move upwards again.

I do not normally work with price objectives for non-company vehicles. We should see commodities/PM move pretty good during the second half of 2018 I think.

594 2018-06-29 13:19:14 The issues of Cuban doctors belong to the @ministryoftade and trade not health since they are commodities for export just like sugar or coffee @LukoyeAtwoli @fnoluga @simonkigondu
595 2018-06-29 13:18:33 Thats laudable sir. I do also think that a cooked meal through NMCs saves a person in distress from having to organize firewood, spices etc to cook the PDS commodities.
596 2018-06-29 13:17:55 Unrealistic approach towards #PlasticBan has resulted in heavy rise in commodities. 

Common man suffering. 

Plastic is a wonderful innovation but we are defaming it just because of irresponsible government.
597 2018-06-29 13:14:57 America's farmers are committing suicide at an alarming rate; corporate farms have the ability to drive prices of commodities down to bankrupt family farms; outcomes of failed supply-side economic policy.
598 2018-06-29 13:14:22 They could do ds at night and we won't have fuel scarcity. Maybe blc we snap bk easily dats y ds things always happen. Maybe it's time to start valuing our lives more than our commodities

600 2018-06-29 13:05:05 Dangote is doing everything to get ahead? Like having Monopoly over major commodities?
601 2018-06-29 13:04:05 Open Air markets are important Public Spaces that need to be designed with adequate circulation routes,  sanitation facilities, display for commodities,  secure storage, waste management systems and fire suppression systems etc. The @CCNairobi has failed to do this.
602 2018-06-29 13:03:42 Do you think that means the US would be happy to cede international pricing of USD denominated assets - eg commodities - to another one or several currencies?
603 2018-06-29 13:01:22 Serious inflation during  the civil war and early commonwealth. Relative values of commodities were very different though so that skews such comparisons. I tend to use Bunyan's 4 eggs to a penny for foodstuffs.
604 2018-06-29 13:00:51 Prayer without work is dead. Govt has to do the work. Widen our roads or provide better ways of transporting such commodities.
605 2018-06-29 12:53:43 What kind of governance is this? What does poor homes mean? In 19 states, others nko? Who picks d states? Wouldn't it be better to put the pay into the economy that will drive the prices of essential commodities down? But we are talking about Buhari here, so anything strange goes
606 2018-06-29 12:53:26 Nice pop off of 118 in $GLD (have pos) with $UUP lower. Now looking at some commodities makes more sense. If UUP fails 24.80 it will be an official topping pattern.
607 2018-06-29 12:50:55 Commodities? Meh!
Too hard for me
Happy to use commodity focused CTAs (as opposed to financial CTAs) as insurance but it's been expensive insurance lately...
608 2018-06-29 12:40:37 If as a "socialist", you advocate "private ownership" &"sovereign citizenship", you must posit that guns are mere personal possessions, like toothbrushes.

617 2018-06-29 12:15:49 I spent this morning talking about moral purpose for the teaching profession/having the #courage to make decisions which are right for #humanity . Students are humans & need to be treated as more than commodities as well as data drivers. Staff need to looked after in schools too.
618 2018-06-29 12:14:22 Tariffs have little or no effect in many commodities such as dairy or meat, and in many cases the full Tariff Rate Quota is not used by non-EU countries
619 2018-06-29 12:14:08 May I add I don't think the fact that money may be used as capital is significant, since it appeared so early on when money was backed by commodities with value. That use, insuring future crops with seed potatoes, does not seem immoral. But, "Give us this day our daily bread"?
620 2018-06-29 12:12:42 On the setting up of a commodities exchange, the NCIP Summit received an  update on the harmonisation of standards for commonly traded commodities  and directed partner states to fast track the process #GOKThisWeek

624 2018-06-29 11:55:42 Afraid it'll take ages.. we're still a long way off. It'll happen but it's going to take time. 

A good start would be realising that our infomation has value, and value it the same way we value other commodities.
625 2018-06-29 11:55:29 Seems a little bit harsh on banana republics seeing as their moniker derived from dependence on one or two items. Unless of course your counting mockery and hate as exportable commodities.
626 2018-06-29 11:53:02 Dollar is appreciating and rupee is declining every day. Oil prices are going up and due to which all essential commodities shoots up. Is this government is taking corrective measures or taking a nap.

635 2018-06-29 11:36:28 The EU imports raw commodities from many countries in Africa tarrif free but applies tariffs to products higher at the value chain. This keeps  these countries in poverty when they should be developing.
636 2018-06-29 11:35:15 Most people on Earth live in a “Poor” country and its even worst for them.  But if you allow people to acquire HUGE wealth quickly, they will find a way to expand the amount of commodities in the world. #tpesa

638 2018-06-29 11:20:58 Yep, it's usury and servitude by design, hidden by some layers of propaganda and complexification, but using people as commodities and tools nonetheless. Down with it all.
639 2018-06-29 11:18:11 In a civilised society where women are sold as cock-teasing commodities on television.

660 2018-06-29 09:23:46 so true, and they are all diminishing commodities!
661 2018-06-29 09:18:54 Elsewhere, prices of commodities crash during holidays and festive periods. In Nigeria, it is a period to f**k people up through price hikes and product hoardings.
662 2018-06-29 09:18:39 The difference is that commodities have been extracted; material wealth has already been produced. In the case of land/location- which hasn‘t been produced- speculation curbs production, in addition to exascerbating the natural rights violation to access to nature.
663 2018-06-29 09:18:14 Is this right? => Books are not commodities, they have copyright monopoly producer, so they have pricing power, and they use it to do (third degree) price discrimination to raise profits from wealthy Kindle owners?

693 2018-06-29 05:55:06 Yes, it’s overall global demand which dictates the price of metals. Locally in the United States, it would be more expensive because of the tariffs. Prompting companies to move jobs elsewhere where commodities are cheaper.
694 2018-06-29 05:48:52 This is true ~6 years into SHA2 asic optimization.  But at some point we'd expect incremental improvements to be so slight that mining rigs effectively become commodities, right?

701 2018-06-29 05:02:42 Congress view is that one GST tax rate of 18% on all commodities including poor people items; BJP policy is that lowest tax rates on essential commodities, less than 18%, and initially high tax rate , even above 18%, on rich items to be gradually reduced. Which is better?

709 2018-06-29 03:59:11 The final death knell, far from the first step, Howard abandoning the Keating govts Industrial strategy of elaborately transformed manufactures to rely purely on commodities was the first step
710 2018-06-29 03:58:21 Drugs muddle up your self-understanding, you become a mushroom suckling on capitalist commodities.
711 2018-06-29 03:49:41 3)PETROL& DIESEL ONLY 2 ESSENL COMMODITIES KEPT OUT OF GST WHY ?SHORTY UNDER GST,ANNIVERSARY  ?
712 2018-06-29 03:39:05 Reason, restraint, and thoughtfulness are probably the most valuable commodities in the current media environment -- journalists jumping to ill-founded conclusions en masse hurts everyone who genuinely wants a rational press in this country
713 2018-06-29 03:33:41 Can you also write about Hater & all the other dumbass dating apps treating humans like commodities, thinking they'll somehow reach & maintain critical mass long enough to make $1 profit, thank you

718 2018-06-29 03:01:02 With the scam that is NHIF pandering to private hospitals and medical tourism institutes in India while public hospital infrastructure, commodities and service delivery are absent...we are talking about #UHC journey and we don't even have legs..God help us
719 2018-06-29 02:50:08 @Bamabroker This is definitely why the $EUR probably the best winner on this Yuan move. *We'll see, early in the night still, but this would all be bullish for commodities and markets imo. I think there is much more to come.
720 2018-06-29 02:47:24 2) Other assets give you rights to future cash flows, property, or tangible commodities. #bitcoin gives you nothing but an entry on a secure ledger that can be sold to a greater fool.
721 2018-06-29 02:46:21 Drugs makes you addicted to commodities produced by capitalists and thus dependent on the continuance of capitalism.
722 2018-06-29 02:23:01 It makes too much sense when you think of stolen babies as commodities. They'll grow up serving the elite, including sexually. 
Why do you think Trump/GOP is dismantling insurance, commerce, food, social security. So that all non-elites will live to serve elites. Read 1984
723 2018-06-29 02:20:03 Right, and I don't disagree, but that also assumes you have commodities that teams are interested in buying early. Which was my contention, the Twins do not.
724 2018-06-29 02:18:39 other things that duterte did not promise but fulfillled:
- giving away part/s of the philippines to china
- decreased the value of peso
- increased the prices of all commodities
- alienate the country to longtime allies
725 2018-06-29 02:16:57 Blockchains are an excuse for exuberance without pissing central banks - who fed tons of free money - keeping equities & commodities cool.
726 2018-06-29 02:05:02 3210: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
727 2018-06-29 02:03:26 Yeah, isn't HE something. Typical little Latino throwing around hate-Americanos y viva los conquistas BS. Loudmouth "marana." We on the border are fed up, and GW, Clintons & Obama all by design & smack in middle of trafficking of several commodities.
728 2018-06-29 01:58:11 what is happening to the Phils! Rising prices of basic and other commodities are unbelievable!
729 2018-06-29 01:52:03 Thats right anurag. I always use futures for all IV calcs. On equities the fut spot calcs are a lot easy on commodities like crude where storage costs and convenience yields are additional factors affecting the spot fut pricing its almost impossible to use spot for option pricing
730 2018-06-29 01:51:11 And the Lefts' politics are all about destroying America. Humans are just commodities to Democrats.
731 2018-06-29 01:46:50 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them

733 2018-06-29 01:43:07 I won’t disagree with you, but it’s not like starting a beef, hog, or crop farm is cheap or easy. Also, SM has devised assistance programs to help people get into the industry. That’s unique to supply-managed commodities.
734 2018-06-29 01:26:50 prever commodities e fx é de fato um grande engano
735 2018-06-29 01:18:17 Yep - not expecting it to go that far (commodities should help this time around)

742 2018-06-29 00:45:43 Understood, but Leonard/PG are exactly what you need to play D against GS.  Long/athletic/skilled defenders. And they are proven commodities where Kuzma/Ingram have what gets GM’s fired...potential.  But who knows if they take the next step.
743 2018-06-29 00:39:22 Rozenwurcel habla de los precios de los commodities. Por qué no dice nada sobre cómo se usaron los miles de millones que se tomaron en deuda y a donde vab a parar? La gente no necesita heladera, en verano tenemos clima antártico, la comida no se pudre nunca ... #chicospobres
744 2018-06-29 00:38:53 las mejores  politicas de estado en décadas no tienen nada que ver.

"el precio de los commodities " te lo explica todo.
bueno

La única inversión valida en esta época es la vergüenza ajena
