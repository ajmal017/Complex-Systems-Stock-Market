1) it dries out in the fridge, so that on re-cooking the oil gets hotter and soaks in more, leading to a "fried" effect

These seem weaker than P3 reserves on Oil & Gas balance sheets which they actually own and have the potential to monetize.
39 2018-06-20 23:56:59 I used to work for a company that helped oil refineries refine oil more efficiently. Is that helping them do more bad things? Or less?

41 2018-06-20 23:56:10 Apply warm coconut oil on your hair, from the root to the ends. Massage for a few minutes and then wrap your hair in a shower cap or towel for at least 30 minutes. Rinse your hair with water, then shampoo and condition like normal.

43 2018-06-20 23:55:53 3. Coconut Oil

To get shiny hair, it is important to provide nourishment by applying oil to your hair regularly. Coconut oil (organic and unrefined) is one of the best options. It helps restore moisture to dry and damaged hair, in turn making it shiny and healthy.
44 2018-06-20 23:55:52 @JaclynLis I have social depression and anxiety. Trying to get better and do not want to take chemical prescriptions. I am researching CBD Oil. Is it legal in NJ and no THC?
45 2018-06-20 23:55:38 Cutting regulations on air pollution, water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, taking over monuments for oil drilling, alienating our longtime best friends, praising Putin who took over our election, praising kim Jong Un who murders his own family.

68 2018-06-20 23:52:20 When oil crashed, the large, structural, inherited surplus was gone and his govt was already in deficit. So you couldn’t have been talking about financial acumen. 

But if low oil prices is a valid excuse, Notley has one. And yet, AB leads Canada (& Canada the G7) in GDP growth.
69 2018-06-20 23:52:13 I let my brother borrow my car yesterday & today cause I’m in SB & I asked him if he changed the oil or refueled the car & he was like “oh I won’t be doing that until I get back from San Diego after the weekend” and I was like what?????? rip having a car I guess 
70 2018-06-20 23:51:51 @soelloo all jokes aside about the stream the other day but a drop or two of purification essential oil added to the load will get rid of that "Left it in the dryer for too long" thing a lot easier than 6 dryer sheets excuse or not. XD

78 2018-06-20 23:50:45 Oil through line 3 isnt for us. We bear the risk. Foreign corp uses eminent domain to make US citizens property so they can export oil out of USA. We dont need it.

88 2018-06-20 23:49:30 Mostly when we talk about Cinematic Universe where one particular film can't tell every story. Another example is Aquaman saving Clark from the ocean after he saved those workers in the oil rig. Wan confirmed it but MoS didn't showed us Arthur saving Clark.
89 2018-06-20 23:49:24 Miracle whip (the inferior brand)  isnt considered mayo because of its oil content.  Real mayo must be at least 65% vegetable oil and miracle whip cant stack up
90 2018-06-20 23:49:24 Even though it’s only slightly cheaper I almost always change my own oil. I know it’s done right, it saves a ton of time, and I get to bond with the machine. Something zen about the whole thing.
91 2018-06-20 23:49:24 @AMSOILINC your name associated with this clown. Your oil is so good it can keep the @realDonaldTrump machine crushing humanity?
92 2018-06-20 23:49:23 #MIDemDebate @Enbridge #Line5 gets panned by all three leading dems in the gubernatorial race. No one said what they would do to replace the line, which supplies an integral oil and propane.

103 2018-06-20 23:47:14 I added half a cup of mayonnaise to my recipe one day, and voilà, it was the most perfect cake I’d ever baked. 

To be clear, my cake did not have any eggs in it, but it did have oil. So the mayonnaise just gave it that extra tiny bit of moisture it was lacking.

118 2018-06-20 23:44:04 BOTH situations provide the oil for the slippery slope we're spiralling down at present.  Not just as a nation.  But as a species.

123 2018-06-20 23:43:29 Because my doctor's practice is real big on holistic stuff, they tell me "Take this probiotic and see if it helps your rosacea and eczema." It's pretty much just made me super constipated and done nothin'. Same with "Use coconut oil." I'm about ready to demand drugs.

134 2018-06-20 23:41:41 I would like to experience the 300mg e-liquid and the 300mg oil so that I could have relief throughout the day @RyderTDK

138 2018-06-20 23:40:53 I was afraid, at first. 

But then I started reading about it, found old recipes… It’s oil and eggs, so all it does is add the moistness that my absolutely almost near perfect dark chocolate & cayenne pepper cake needed.
139 2018-06-20 23:40:43 She can change her own oil now.
140 2018-06-20 23:40:09 プールとか入るとよくわからないけど凄まじい勢いで浮くよ。
141 2018-06-20 23:39:23 Filled my gas tank. $43. $1.479 per litre. There is absolutely no excuse for an oil producing nation to charge that much for fuel.
142 2018-06-20 23:39:19 crush me, until the oil flows like rain.
143 2018-06-20 23:39:12 It’s like a lotto ticket. Buy a 200k house. Put in sprinkler system accidentally find 2m worth of oil.
144 2018-06-20 23:39:09 Gas & oil extracted leaves ONE giant cavity.

146 2018-06-20 23:39:03 you already have your oil, your bulky checkbook does not? Well, as the saying goes: I saved the wing for those who follow, you ... ALREADY ROBBER MUCH!
147 2018-06-20 23:38:36 When will you be coming out with an avocado oil tartar sauce?
148 2018-06-20 23:38:36 I have taken my weight in CBD oil today and am still anxious af 
149 2018-06-20 23:38:36 Of course. *I nod and turn on the heat, putting in olive oil and soy sauce and adding in the veggies*
150 2018-06-20 23:38:27 Lol Innovation is just someone doing it better than someone else. He’s added a few very cute self regulating ideas and made it holistic model which is genius. But at the time the model we created rocked the oil industry - it was soon copied as that’s the nature of oil networks.
151 2018-06-20 23:38:19 Not to get too technical, but running without oil will actually completely seize up your engine REALLY quickly.
152 2018-06-20 23:37:44 I used my first free oil change of my “lifetime free oil changes” and they even threw in a car wash. My car was filthy too.
153 2018-06-20 23:37:43 That why she works for free?
154 2018-06-20 23:37:30 Someone tell the White House there's a country with oil and other nice stuff and they're locking kids in cages. Let's go to war
155 2018-06-20 23:37:29 Umk, now we cooking with oil.

160 2018-06-20 23:36:37 Hi, are your products made using fossil fuels - oil and gas? If so is the gas from fracking?
161 2018-06-20 23:36:36 Some of you females don’t have bf y’all have gf who don’t know how to do oil changes or check to see if you need radiator fluid yet alone check ur tire psi  good luck In life
162 2018-06-20 23:36:36 I miss the good old days when it was cheaper to change your own oil at home.
163 2018-06-20 23:36:21 Any particular reason why this includes DDGS, Ethanol and HFCS but not soybean meal and soybean oil? Or other co-products?

165 2018-06-20 23:36:08 Dudes expect to be praised for doing the most basic shit.

“I changed my oil. I cook my own meals. I mowed the lawn. I give oral, I dont just receive it. I barbecued by just flipping patties on a grill. IM WINNING!”

Congrats you do the bare minimum.

166 2018-06-20 23:36:07 I’m gonna block you. Only the body wash and oil I can vouch for
167 2018-06-20 23:35:58 Palm oil production is an evil business. These companies buying up the land that much of belongs to the indigenous peoples who have had this land in their families for hundreds of years. Their rights are being ignored so the government can sell off land to these companies.
WRONG!
168 2018-06-20 23:35:32 Let's start here. Every solar & wind generator need 100% backup from a baseload plant-coal, nuclear, gas, oil. That makes it all disastrously expensive.
169 2018-06-20 23:35:28 i’m getting my oil changed & it was WAY over due & im TERRIFIED the man doing it is going to give me sass 

like. i know. i fucked up. and i’ll probably do it again. pls don’t confront me about it

171 2018-06-20 23:35:26 Just gotta oil my scalp before night end.
172 2018-06-20 23:35:16 Why not merge oil and water while you're at it, dumbasses?
173 2018-06-20 23:35:04 Yup! The Pure Honey & the Argon oil one. I think I like the Pure Honey one better but I shampoo so rarely I honestly can’t remember lol
174 2018-06-20 23:35:00 If this coconut oil doesn’t miraculously fix my face then i’ll be severely disappointed.
175 2018-06-20 23:34:51 They've sucked since 78. Why we need to import workers for high tech and the 6 million jobs available now can't find workers.

177 2018-06-20 23:34:30 Wow, you're going to need a snake oil tanker truck to supply that crowd!
178 2018-06-20 23:34:29 It's Southern colonialism. "Yeah, I might be dirt poor, but I'm better than that brown guy over there." It becomes, "I didn't get the job because of affirmative action," rather than, "I didn't get the job because I came in smelling like oil and five day old grease."
179 2018-06-20 23:34:28 Cook it in some sort of broth, with a lil less fluids than you would with rice!!! Put olive oil or butter in the broth first
180 2018-06-20 23:34:15 thank God I made it to the lube center today for my oil change & free top off, I swear everytime I pull up I tend to run out of of coolant but they get me right everytime

182 2018-06-20 23:34:05 Problem is that we trade that oil and NG for money, we can't eat it.

186 2018-06-20 23:33:39 There's not much on this planet I hate more than coconut!! Buuutttt.... I love the oil!!
187 2018-06-20 23:33:30 Looks nice although a little less curry powder is used. Goat always needs increased quantities of oil or best taste comes with clarified butter
188 2018-06-20 23:33:25 Coconut oil & honey mask. 
189 2018-06-20 23:33:17 Does anyone have at home remedies for curing fishy hiccups from taking fish oil capsules? What can I eat that actually curves the ocean flem belches from hell? I am not a pescatarian FYI
190 2018-06-20 23:33:15 Nigga oil?
191 2018-06-20 23:33:09 Yes please, add some olive oil and soy’s sauce.
192 2018-06-20 23:33:02 hhhhh people in this province hate on trudeau for all the wrong reasons saying you don’t think he’s very good is valid but saying it’s because he’s “ruining the oil industry” somehow is not valid
193 2018-06-20 23:32:59 I decided enough was enough and kept on trying until I succeeded. I also have many helpful strategies in my toolbox, such as EFT tapping and dill essential oil.
194 2018-06-20 23:32:59 A spoonie's got to do what a spoonie's got to do, but oh, please just make sure to support your liver detoxing! Water w lemon, activated charcoal, plenty of greens, etc! Fyi, a little lemon essential oil, or other citrus or mint, in a spray bottle will freshen w out poison! X
195 2018-06-20 23:32:55 Would you support oil drilling 26 miles off the coast of California.  Think about it.
196 2018-06-20 23:32:53 This meeting should be FUN to watch! #EU is trying to work together and #US want you to Follow! Liquid Water and Oil do not mix together! Better #EU find its Strengh!

197 2018-06-20 23:32:48 So sad to see this snake oil salesman enchant a crowd of Minnesotans. MN is better than that. Duluth is better than that. He is screwing them as he has screwed people all of his life, for fun and profit. He would toss sell America out in a heartbeat for a financial "win." Has.
198 2018-06-20 23:32:43 Retirement! For this sorry sack of shit!

209 2018-06-20 23:30:39 Conservative ideology is loosely based on preserving existing social and economic structure. Some of the economic conservatives got their riches from oil, mining, transportation, logging - activities at odds with conservatism. Others have been convinced by them e.g. AFP.
210 2018-06-20 23:30:38 In the U.S., CBD oil is not regulated by the FDA, meaning each batch could have different concentrations causing different effects on a person from batch to batch. Also, depends what kind of pain you are treating.
211 2018-06-20 23:30:33 The barrels are never used for petroleum, but for motor oil.
Obvious that now are void, for this installation.
212 2018-06-20 23:30:30 EVERYONE START SHAVING WITH COCONUT OIL AND YOUR LIFE WILL BE CHANGED, JUST PUT IT ON LIKE YOU WOULD SHAVING CREAM, SHAVE, WASH IT OFF WITH BODY WASH, DRY, AND THEN APPLY LOTION OR MORE COCONUT OIL TO ADD MOISTURE, YOUR LIFE WILL BE CHANGED 100%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)

218 2018-06-20 23:29:35 You do realise the United Arab Emirates are a country of their own and dont share laws with Saudi Arabia. They are very progressive and have a free and open society. They are investing in a  future with no oil.

220 2018-06-20 23:29:30 The US can NEVER reasonably expect to compete with Russia/Iran/Iraq in terms of supplying energy to Europe. There is no logistical legerdemain that can EVER make *shipping* oil/gas cheaper than pumping it via a pipeline. The US must come to grips with that inescapable reality.

231 2018-06-20 23:27:02 ... One of the reasons I chose to live in Latin America is that there isn’t a singular nuclear warhead in any of LA’s countries. But I fear for Venezuela because it has the highest oil reserves on our planet, and the US always takes what it wants...

246 2018-06-20 23:24:18 You forgot to add that the mismanagement spans literally generations. In '14 they received even more direct government oversight and things got worse. Government management is also the reason why an Island utility burns oil for power generation. They have no reason to be efficent
247 2018-06-20 23:24:04 Yeah but space army is cooler. Plus if they find oil in space, they may be able to use that to fund healthcare.... Or more military to find more terrorists (oil)
248 2018-06-20 23:24:01 Like Obama saying he had no authority to grant relief to dreamers?
249 2018-06-20 23:23:57 Some people say the move towards renewable energy dealt a heavy blow on GE. and their turbine technology. Any economy that depend on oil should take that as a lesson and adjust accordingly.

266 2018-06-20 23:21:06 the tariffs and increased price of oil since you took office have more than wiped out any tax cut you gave

279 2018-06-20 23:19:39 #THESELLINGOFADYNAST These photo-ops are simply to project the vacuous  @RahulGandhi as a sought-after Neta.  The reality is the others in the Opposition consider him of little account and @ahmedpatel has to oil his way around @MamataOfficial.
280 2018-06-20 23:19:29 yeah a bih got sunburnt but at least i'm a hot looking tomato  (also high key my fault for using baby oil to tan)
281 2018-06-20 23:19:17 The coal and oil workers are being regulated out of work, factory workers are losing their jobs to immigrants and outsourcing. So they have shifted GOP

283 2018-06-20 23:19:11 Not surprising you have a fresh attack. A nation cannot survive without controlling its borders. Something you oppose. Unlimited unrestricted migration is your goal. You dont give a damn about Americans, just your flawed destructive ideology.
284 2018-06-20 23:18:40 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
285 2018-06-20 23:18:33 I’m a bad tradie. My truck was running rough. Put a fan of sea foam in it and changed the oil super often to see if there was an issue. Didn’t think to change my air filter after pollen season. Shit was caked and now my truck is running a ton better.
286 2018-06-20 23:18:20 I can remember a time when “Nazis” felt like some foreign, ancient thing like dinosaurs, the plague, castor oil

288 2018-06-20 23:18:06 In that case, I am gonna eat a slab of butter for dinner & wash it down with olive oil.
289 2018-06-20 23:18:06 Fast acting yeast activated with sugar, and punch it down once after it doubles, rerise, use melted butter in place of oil. 1/2 white flour, 1/2 whole wheat flour.
290 2018-06-20 23:18:00 He isn't even paying to develop his hyperloop, he's getting college kids to do it for him for free. @elonmusk is a snake oil salesman at best.
291 2018-06-20 23:17:35 And here in Cda they want carbon tax $ to go towards innovations that make oil / gas industry more efficient and not to green tech which has more jobs. We're falling behind as world surpasses us.
292 2018-06-20 23:17:35 In my opinion if we don't want asylum seekers, why are we wasting time on the border? It is obvious these countries need help. Why are we not in there taking out these gangs? Why is this continuing? Any oil enriched country we would be "solving" this issue!
293 2018-06-20 23:17:32 I did the H2ocean spray on it a few times a day! The jewelry also makes a big difference. Sterling silver is what works best for mine. Also tea tree oil works wonders for bubbles!!

317 2018-06-20 23:14:35 Interesting that the Pharisees worried about the oil being"wasted" on Jesus yet they never gave it to the woman.
318 2018-06-20 23:14:06 The GOP is also all about enacting a tax cut for the wealthy and promoting oil and drilling interests over the safeguarding of the environment.  This they have achieved with Trump.  But they should speak up against the horrors of this immoral #IllegitimatePresident .

327 2018-06-20 23:13:04 So many ways, one mentioned yesterday: cut in aid.  Another, tax money transfers (did you know more money is wired to MX from US than MX's oil export revenue...almost 3Xs as much).  Not to worry, MX will pay.

334 2018-06-20 23:12:12 @Oil_Guns_Merica why do you have to say about the rich people. They r the ones who make the jobs.
335 2018-06-20 23:12:11 Trump did the right thing though he won't get credit.  The optics were horrible and there are diff standards. Substinatively it hasn't changed anything. The new attack is detention of anyone in any form at all.
336 2018-06-20 23:12:09 king!! king of having good taste in movies and king of nursing!

you would think right? but at least now she knows you're supposed to heat the oil before the garlic and the onions. it's a slow process.
337 2018-06-20 23:11:57 Have u tried tea tree oil? Or lemon juice? Diluted with water otherwise u will burn ur face. Or baking soda made into a paste mixed w water applied to the pimples helps with inflammation!!!
338 2018-06-20 23:11:57 My dude! I can't even with some of this nonsense. How many times do you have to be dropped on your head and force fed castor oil for this to be acceptable?

341 2018-06-20 23:11:29 I don't want any more professional politicians but I do want citizens who don't want or need to pay back big pharma, big oil or big anything. You'd think a hotelier would encourage illegals but he doesn't. America first. The working middle class I was raised in. We pay the bills.
342 2018-06-20 23:11:24 3D printing is useful for manufacturing parts that are otherwise complicated or impossible by conventional means, are expensive to ship (ie. oil rig, space), or making prototypes (making manufacturing grade of just 1 item is expensive)
343 2018-06-20 23:11:23 my mother in law got me the lil CBD oil drops and it has helped w my anxiety IMMENSELY. i've only been taking it for a lil over a week but i went from daily panic attacks to none!!
344 2018-06-20 23:11:19 They will eventually rally assuming oil prices hold/rise. SU/CNQ are the primary recipients of money flowing into the Cdn oil space currently, but the likes of TOG, WCP and CPG will catch up. We need a change in gov't to initiate international investors to return to the space.

349 2018-06-20 23:10:55 Ok, I'll go with that!! I don't know how much Big Oil would like it though. It's time for THEM to go home!!
350 2018-06-20 23:10:54 I wonder how much castor oil costs at Whole Foods?

358 2018-06-20 23:09:55 What a great and revealing presentation by @FairQuestions. Now we just have to figure out how to get the same info out enmass to the general population.  The protests against KM and the Alberta Oil Sands have one goal. To landlock Alberta oil for the benefit of US refiners.

I have a 2007 Chevy Tahoe LS (4x4) with an oil leak. I’ve tracked it down to what I can tell is the back of the intake manifold. I’m losing close to a quart a day, sometimes more. Is this something I can fix myself?

363 2018-06-20 23:09:32 Can't believe Oilers did not fully pursue Hoffman. He basically went for little. Could of trade anyone of the floaters. Oil really needed that score a goal when u need it guy like Hoffman. Poor decision and looks like another mediocre season, I will pass on the season tickets.
364 2018-06-20 23:09:29 Hopefully this is a highlight reel, how about we include hydroelectric power in the have/have not calculations. Income from energy production  is income - whether it be oil, hydro, solar or wind. Money doesn't care where it comes from, why should we?
365 2018-06-20 23:09:13 It's all such a serious mess.  The system needs to be more efficient.  But  the government & efficiency are like oil & water.
366 2018-06-20 23:08:54 "This oil should have been SOLD"
367 2018-06-20 23:08:42 I need @chrissyteigen's #BECCAxCHRISSY Endless Summer Glow body oil for Puerta Vallarta. I need it!!! 
368 2018-06-20 23:08:14 National unity is an ever evolving challenge; almost like a moving target as situations change; fishing, price of oil; it's endless. Every nation has them, Scotland is not an exception. Canada is the perfect example.
369 2018-06-20 23:08:12 AND .. we need to put our money where our mouth (and conscience) is and stop buying crap toxic pseudo food with palm oil in it!!! Buy it & you're complicit in financing the destruction ( it's in almost all baked/processed foods by the way). The buck stops with the consumer

375 2018-06-20 23:07:22 It's easy for the US to sell it cheaply when you're bombing and looting oil rich countries though, isn't it?
376 2018-06-20 23:07:18 So its either the current model, which is heavy oil and power generation costs and rates as high or higher than third world country, or Oligarchs? Got it
377 2018-06-20 23:07:13 This tired argument again? Are oil companies funding these guys or something??!! EVs do NOT produce Diesel particulates, soot, NOX, Carbon monoxide ..... need we go on. EVs hardly use their brakes, it’s all done on regen. Tyres are similar are they not ICE or EV???!
378 2018-06-20 23:07:02 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.

382 2018-06-20 23:06:53 Worked out , got my oil changed , did my homework, cleaned my house . Guess I’ll go clean my car 
383 2018-06-20 23:06:52 Sadly it is but isn’t politics, its a basic sales technique in full effect... Create demand, desire and then dependency. Oil companies, car companies and the like all showing how its done
384 2018-06-20 23:06:33 I almost jumped on the oil at 66.30.  Was waiting to see if it was going to keep moving up and it crashed back down before I had my order in.  Great call.  Yes easy to see looking back at charts.  Not so easy in the middle of a trade.  Takes time.
385 2018-06-20 23:06:27 He’s not a populist leader, he’s a snake oil salesman who exploited the deplorable.
386 2018-06-20 23:06:25 @arkellsmusic  Arrachera:  Its a skirt steak taco where the meat is marinated in orange and lime juice. Grilled to perfection and topped with a cucumber in fused pico de gallo. The tortilla is lightly coated in oil and grilled. It's a new twisted on some old good vibes.

390 2018-06-20 23:05:28 I guarantee he’s in Philly being protected by anti-American hipsters. His beard will be shinier than pictured after being drowned in beard oil. He may be spotted riding a fixed gear bike, carrying a typewriter on city buses, and may adopt a foster mommy to live in her basement.

392 2018-06-20 23:05:21 No doubt it is a struggle. Me it took a wake up call (having a Stroke) but instead of a diet per se, I changed my eating habits...no salt, no refined sugar, only fresh fruits and veggies, no cream in my coffee, no butter (use olive oil only) and so on...oh and walking....

399 2018-06-20 23:03:52 In Somalia sleeping men get boiling oil thrown all over their bodies due to jealousy. In fact in the this part of the world we call it 'crimes of passion' which is something I will never understand.

401 2018-06-20 23:03:27 A much much better joke would be something about Trump wanting to stop 'illegal aliens'. Or at least take their oil. I mean we're not exactly trading with the aliens.

But I love Trump's tariffs. causes lefties to start talking like Milton Friedman.
402 2018-06-20 23:03:22 We have to correct our narrative and the intuition that suggests

"Wherever there's smoke, there's fire"

If you understand anything about cooking oil, you'll know there's a

1) Smoke point

2) Flash point

3) Flame point

And neither of these are the same
403 2018-06-20 23:03:20 You can use 100% pure organic coconut oil. I use the kind in the jar and apply it to my face and leave it about and hour and wash it off with baby bath and it has helped my face greatly just don't leave it real long

414 2018-06-20 23:01:57 Watched a video where they mixed turmeric, baking soda and coconut oil and brushed their teeth with it to make them whiter, I tried it and not only did my teeth remain the same colour but it tasted fucking AWFUL and somehow made my cheeks raw as fuck, do not try this at home

418 2018-06-20 23:01:29 Maybe I'm just old, but I remember when we went through major oil price increases and gasoline price increases in the 1970's.  People changed their behaviour --and bought more fuel efficient vehicles -- launching the Japanese car makers success in North America -- People respond
419 2018-06-20 23:01:25 So Rick, going into a grocery store and loading up without paying is ok as long as you're hungry? 
A country cannot survive if it doesn't control its borders. Being poor is not a reason for asylum or unlimited migration.

RE: The degree of precision of #Fibonacci ratios when applying them to trading
If trading is a science, the precision should be 5 decimal digits at least. 
If trading is an art, certain tolerances of precision would be allowed by Fibonacci himself.
428 2018-06-20 23:00:06 The global crisis brings to light the fact that Gvmts only get involved in helping countries when there's something to gain (like America & oil). Stop the crisis by helping ppl without looking for profit!

I can’t think of anybody on the planet that’s more deserving of being tarred & feathered, burned at the stake, then quartered before being boiled in oil. She’s a disgusting ‘human being’.
446 2018-06-20 22:57:29 The word "Failed" assumes that the purposes were those given by Bush admin and Neocons rather than being a success at: fomenting terror as a justification for wider US military presence; destabilisation and regime change; keeping oil expensive and subject to US strategic denial.

Keep in mind that OPEC is principally muzzi scum and their goal is to destroy American oil.

467 2018-06-20 22:53:38 I figured if they take the drugs they would have enough energy to change the oil, fight, and fix a sink...all in that order. 
468 2018-06-20 22:53:29 Would love to try NEW Olive Oil crisps They look Delicious.
469 2018-06-20 22:53:15 @theRealTavarish The crankcase pressure is too high or the seals are bad on your turbo. None of your scenarios make sense. You said you have 60 PSI pressure coming in, that means in your current setup you have SEVERE restriction and causing the oil to come out the seals.
470 2018-06-20 22:52:49 I don't think I could do edibles because I have a very hard time not eating sweets when they're in the house even when I'm NOT stoned. I've been wanting to try CBD oil though.
471 2018-06-20 22:52:44 That's what your regime told you. It is nonsense. If the Jews controlled the world they would certainly do better than to take a tiny piece of land with no oil and limited natural resources.

474 2018-06-20 22:52:33 On the phone with my mom telling her that Mrs Norris and I were hanging outside and then I go “and then we vacuumed and we did laundry and we got my oil changed and we went to target!” As if Mrs N actually did those things with me

486 2018-06-20 22:51:03 @SamHarrisOrg Hey, Sam! Have you ever considered doing a podcast on Silicon Valley Snake Oil Salesman? The timing is pretty good in the wake the recent Theranos collapse/indictments and (sorrt) the strong likelihood that Tesla will implode, possibly by year’s end. Thoughts?
487 2018-06-20 22:50:45 Yep, when I oil myself up I drop the soap in front of big Danny from the upper section. Proper nice bloke is Danny, loves EDL more than right hooking the wife

489 2018-06-20 22:50:27 I’ve been loving @OGXBeauty Miracle coconut oil shampoo and conditioner, with their miracle coconut oil penetrating oil. But I also use coconut oil over night on my hair two/three times a week. My hair has grown a ton. ALSO CUT BACK ON HEAT TOOLS

497 2018-06-20 22:49:36 @NorthernlionLP Motor oil, maybe, I'm not sure if it would metabolize or not, but glass wouldn't provide calories. It's essentially just a few elements (silicone, oxygen, sometimes boron or whatever), so it isn't really an organic substance and thus wouldn't provide energy.
498 2018-06-20 22:49:28 but like actually go stream sophie’s oil of every pearl’s un-insides right now its a fucking masterpiece

558 2018-06-20 22:40:59 Damn - I just bought $6000 worth of olive oil!!!
559 2018-06-20 22:40:55 Never forget one of the most shitty things she said was that Libya should pay us back with their oil revenue after we bombed their country. God she sucks.
560 2018-06-20 22:40:50 Cubed sweet potatoes, olive oil, garlic n chili powder, roasted in the oven at 450! Black beans, follow your heart fiesta blend vegan cheese! Some veggie chilli would have been super bomb but it was great!!!!

562 2018-06-20 22:40:46 Area Business Manager - Oil & Gas (6-10 yrs) UP/Aligarh/Gonda (Sales Management)...
563 2018-06-20 22:40:41 Honorable - but if you loved your home state like I do mine, why wouldn’t you fix CA? You could take @EmpowerTexans w you & “Empower” CA! Sound good? Oh, that’s right, they don’t have oil & gas, great public schools & communities, & the GOP left to destroy.
564 2018-06-20 22:40:40 This will never be solved until consensus is reached that control over a country's borders is essential for its survival.  
Not happening any time soon.
565 2018-06-20 22:40:33 The Cowichan Valley is moving ahead with renewable resources even if others are still stuck on dirty oil.
566 2018-06-20 22:40:18 Garlic and olive oil R all I need in life
567 2018-06-20 22:40:15 Mini Anna Paquin was trapped in a  toilet but was saved by a heating mechanic wearing lime covered in Mustard oil who was sadly eaten by a convicted cougar who had a third ear made of kutnohorite
568 2018-06-20 22:40:13 Look at it from the other extreme. Say that it was a well known fact that oil was finished in 20 years. Given that all the worlds resources would be put the task of replacing oil with anything close to the abundance we now have how long would it take to get back to where we are?
569 2018-06-20 22:40:12 ああ、これはまずい。実にまずい。0.1トン超えたよ。

574 2018-06-20 22:38:36 The guy who just changed my oil asked if I thought our local water park really puts dye in the pool to tell if someone pees. Bro you nervous

576 2018-06-20 22:38:20 Oteraw anezapata dem thinner instead of baby oil
577 2018-06-20 22:38:18 It certainly doesn’t endorse the LNA though - wonder if the implication is to remove all armed grouos from the oil area.

580 2018-06-20 22:37:55 How hard can it be for her to produce some Olive Oil and Balsamico - available in most local supermarkets.
581 2018-06-20 22:37:53 8. As of Monday night, the Italian banking system is on its knee. Wholesale importers will not have any letter of credit. For one year, you will not get oil, champagne, peanut butter and your beloved Apple products. Your wage will be cut immediately before being converted in lira
582 2018-06-20 22:37:46 "The solution is actually simple. Turn the oil off for only a couple of days. The ensuing chaos and economic destruction will result in an immediate presidential and congressional law deeming oil an essential industry to the security of the U.S.A.",A.Stewart

584 2018-06-20 22:37:44 SA already increased exports in May.  This may be a reason why overall oil/products inventory have increased since 5/11 even though we are in the middle of the high demand season.
585 2018-06-20 22:37:39 I hate paying/waiting for oil changes but always feel so much better when it’s done 
586 2018-06-20 22:37:33 I think part of the renovations before Trump moved in included anointing oil for each room.
587 2018-06-20 22:37:30 I do not like your pranks! They make things harder for us and I do not think you realize how harmful they can be! Do you realize how long it took for Iruma-san to clean me out when you replaced my maintenance oil with molasses?!

I am not a produce item! My creation was my birth!
588 2018-06-20 22:37:27 My son's girlfriend mentioned it too.
589 2018-06-20 22:37:26 All armed actors.. + what British ambassador said about UNSC action.. could see no fly zone on oil crescent by Africom.. NATO less likely.. but would be a pivot for GNA - LNA reconciliation in central Libya under US air cover. Depends what the P5 agree.

600 2018-06-20 22:35:14 Yep, they don't ride bicycles and have hundreds of miles of factories outside Shanghai. 
Also have terrible pollution in cities and a civil war in Western China along with rapidly declining oil fields.

604 2018-06-20 22:34:26 Someone once told me you should steam your face with peppermint oil or something like that to get your beard to grow. Anyway I’m still waiting on tips to get the perfect smokey eye

609 2018-06-20 22:33:19 The Canadian oil sands are just too large to escape the spotlight. We can't simultaneously say that we're an energy superpower and that we're too small to make any difference on climate change.
610 2018-06-20 22:33:08 Where’s the olive oil for hoes idk about this extra abstinent olive oil
611 2018-06-20 22:33:01 Have you tried CBD oil, as a replacement?
612 2018-06-20 22:33:00 My local Essential Oil Woo Lady is mad at me. She did a big thing questioning what "the underlying causes of illness are?" 

I answered "Biology."

She asked me what I meant, & I explained. Now people are agreeing with me. Guess that's not where she wanted to take the discussion.
613 2018-06-20 22:32:33 I need someone to change my oil. Would you be so kind? It goes in through here... *spreads legs*
614 2018-06-20 22:32:31 CBD oil has made me REALLY TIRED but will it make me fall asleep before 4am? We'll find out
615 2018-06-20 22:32:05 Egg Salad counts as a salad and it's literally eggs mixed with a mix of eggs and oil.

616 2018-06-20 22:31:31 Here locally, the CO CD2 candidate who is accepting corporately funded PAC money along with lobbying firm money tied to oil and gas placed an ad on this video that you must watch in order to watch the video in full. #gosaira #nodirtymoney

620 2018-06-20 22:30:47 Ah, the joyful combination of smelling like gear oil and itching from fiberglass header wrap. Gives one pause when complaining about the comparatively blissful issue of being covered in fur shavings.
621 2018-06-20 22:30:34 Hate coming for an oil change and they wanna do all this extra shit 
622 2018-06-20 22:30:32 That has always been their game.  The are starting to lose some ground with the black community so they need to import more minorities who will support their agenda or they will never win again.

635 2018-06-20 22:28:04 Considering I once forgot to add oil to a box cake mix, I’d say our baking capabilities are vastly different  Your food tweets always look so delicious (even burned ) You’re really talented!
636 2018-06-20 22:27:42 it made sense with coconut oil and a coconut milk-based sauce. i dunno. this is why i can’t write recipes v well.
637 2018-06-20 22:27:17 Only 12k miles on the car and I changed the oil twice!!

639 2018-06-20 22:27:09 Baby oil ni for flicking the bean only if my nigga can't make me cream with his touch ion want him
640 2018-06-20 22:27:01 It is. We hear passing immigration reform is the answer. No reform will stop illegal immigration. It's an outright lie on both sides. If we reform legal immigration the illegal will linger. Recognizing this would help in crafting a solution overall @mschlapp
641 2018-06-20 22:26:59 “The only thing that will kill oil is oil”. As the wise man said.
642 2018-06-20 22:26:46 Work in the oil and gas industry New Mexico, Texas and Louisiana
643 2018-06-20 22:26:34 The positive economic argument for carbon pricing: our oil exports are a shield issue. We want more pipeline capacity so we can get a better price (higher netback) for Canadian oil. Without credible Canadian policy on climate change, the oil sands can't escape being scapegoated.

646 2018-06-20 22:26:16 Only the naïve can ever think that conservatives could work with the liberal enemy.   Not happening. Right and wrong do not mix.  They are like water and oil.  Grow up. Life didn’t stop when you were 5-years old.  Please. EB
647 2018-06-20 22:25:48 Ya know you gotta change the oil every few thousand miles, right?! 
648 2018-06-20 22:25:46 2/  lacks true fundamental demand (like the oil market does for example), is relatively small, and less liquid big players can influence the price in a certain direction when they want
649 2018-06-20 22:25:42 I think everyone’s getting confused about the Cannabis thing that’s being highlighted in the news recently - you can already get oil from licensed places which has the hallucinogens taken out. The Government ministers are spinning this as they have bought in to farms
650 2018-06-20 22:25:42 Footie only started when some rich oil dude bought Citeh. Nothing before that

The meetings will be closed press and the governor says he'll withhold comment during ongoing PUC proceedings.

664 2018-06-20 22:23:33 Stop asking so many damn pertinent and reasonable questions!  You must be in on the plot too!  Big oil-auto-shorts will stop at nothing.

665 2018-06-20 22:23:17 Because some power want us to consume low quality oil and to import many many used cars...

669 2018-06-20 22:22:45 This is literally what caused the Renaissance in Italy, the Industrial revolution in Britain, and made the US the global economic superpower right up until trickle down economics showed up. Same thing each time. The poor are the oil that greases the entire machine.
670 2018-06-20 22:22:37 We did a very poor job statingour demands.  Separating kids from parents was our big talking point, so that was the only thing they felt they had to deal with.

704 2018-06-20 22:18:41 Coconut oil is so overrated
705 2018-06-20 22:18:39 Look at Geology theory's such as Fossil based or carbon crust based one has a peak Oil theory the other does not.
706 2018-06-20 22:18:21 America has caused the problems in South America wanting to control their Governments and rape their countries for the mineral and oil wealth plus agriculture. Unrest caused by USA makes for asylum seekers. Karma.
707 2018-06-20 22:18:11 probably invest in crude oil pipeline. Oh wait no, that's your plan
708 2018-06-20 22:18:09 @TheAJayII Good sis! I know you loved Charli's Vroom Vroom EP, so you'll enjoy SOPHIE's album "Oil Of Every Pearls Un-Insides"! She produced the Charli EP and her album, for the most part, is EVERYTHING!!!
709 2018-06-20 22:18:05 @Lucas_Oil your customer service is bad. No one will respond.  Why?
710 2018-06-20 22:18:02 Out of shaving cream? No problem. Use olive oil instead (plus it smells good!)
711 2018-06-20 22:17:47 I think it’s becoming legal for medical use in NC, have you tried CBD oil
712 2018-06-20 22:17:42 Like @SBakerMD says... the trifecta of ... well, let's keep it civil. Refined flour, refined sugar, refined seed oil.
713 2018-06-20 22:17:41 Not a fan. I like mine like McDonalds does it only not as crunchy. Like they used to cook them in real oil.
714 2018-06-20 22:17:33 But the oil; was flowing when Haftar attacked. Earlier Haftar and Jadhran got along as well.
715 2018-06-20 22:17:23 80 minute #massage = pure heaven.   The therapist worked out knots in my back & neck that I didn't know I had.
#relaxed #swedishmassage Even had the lavender oil for me too.
716 2018-06-20 22:17:21 Try it with salt pepper and olive oil

718 2018-06-20 22:17:15 I would absolutely kill for a 9-5 job right. The idea of getting my evenings back so I can just burn the midnight oil writing and video making again would be the best. 
719 2018-06-20 22:17:14 Meanwhile Hick ushers in hundreds of O&G wells into the State; huh it turns out fracked oil and gas contributes significantly to our F air quality rating & to climate change. Word on the street for several yrs now climate scientist urge no new fossil fuel extraction. #greenwash
720 2018-06-20 22:17:14 peanut oil everywhere is not at all surprising.  sesame oil could also play a roll?
721 2018-06-20 22:17:12 Until you gotta pay for gas, or change ya oil, or rotate ya tires. It was only fun when I had a stick shift
722 2018-06-20 22:16:56 Have you gotten your three servings of coconut oil today? Bonus points if it's non-GMO.
723 2018-06-20 22:16:44 I would love to help rub the oil in if you want some help
724 2018-06-20 22:16:40 Chairman of Pioneer Natural Resources says US oil production will increase from 11 million bpd today to 15 million by 2025.

725 2018-06-20 22:16:32 I was talking about the latest trip to the sandbox, man, not the first one. I was in middle school for the first one. I was also talking about gas prices hitting almost $5 a gallon in 2005 in Cali. The start of the Forever War was an excuse to make rich oil dudes richer.
726 2018-06-20 22:16:13 you could probably sell most Canadians on nationalizing oil by promising to refine and distribute it domestically, providing low prices to end consumers. I hear people complain all the time wondering why we make our own oil but pay high gas prices.
727 2018-06-20 22:15:45 Overheard at OPEC gala dinner tonight: Gulf OPEC minister says he listened to @MacroVoices podcast special oil report last week and really enjoyed it. (For the record, he complimented another speaker, not me. Easy guess:) @ErikSTownsend
728 2018-06-20 22:15:43 Alberta is the Texas of Canada. Oil, cattle, and idiot rural folks what loves themselves a greasy politician. Hell, if @jkenney and Ted Cruz got in a slippery bastard battle it would go into overtime... #AbLeg #abpoli

733 2018-06-20 22:15:13 I need an oil change
734 2018-06-20 22:15:01 Coconut oil
735 2018-06-20 22:14:59 I support anything that help human suffering. Yes I support the use of cannabis oil.
736 2018-06-20 22:14:56 Coconut oil doesn’t count.
737 2018-06-20 22:14:53 Ok. Why would we not back the UAE? We get little to no oil from them.
738 2018-06-20 22:14:41 just put oil in Darrien's oil. now we wait.

742 2018-06-20 22:14:32 Total Bullshit. The US does NOT help. The US wants regime change around the globe for OIL and Resources. Period. There is ZERO thought to human rights or the innocents who are murdered by the people the US supports with Arms and $$$

744 2018-06-20 22:14:08 This is great way to create South American #ISIS chapter. #Americans should soon start to figure out that if you support the annexing of land from innocent #Palestinians, cage children, greedily chase oil thru Mid East these things will come back to bite you. #ImmigrationReform
745 2018-06-20 22:14:06 Wait, wait, my friend Tim! Actually everything and all markets suck with exception of US stocks, US dollar and oil!
746 2018-06-20 22:14:05 ikr... I can't trade oil stocks rn. 
747 2018-06-20 22:14:04 Palm oil or corn traiding
748 2018-06-20 22:14:02 It was a diversion anyway to crank up fracked oil and gas.

750 2018-06-20 22:13:34 The budget deficit has been coming down each year it has dropped £3.5 b in 2 years, steady work by SNP initiatives are paying and exports up, oil is expected up to $100 a barrell, Scots can’t be conned forever you know.
751 2018-06-20 22:13:15 Hell no. But I'll emu oil your Brazil nuts.
752 2018-06-20 22:13:04 The negligent actions of one company and the consequences tell the entire industry not to do said act. Humans aren't all powerful to where we can completely clean up  our oil spills without incurring consequences.
753 2018-06-20 22:12:58 Ralph Klein balanced the budget with $10-$20 oil, and then paid off the entire debt with $30-$40 oil. With higher interest rates. All without any new pipelines. The $150 oil came far later and only lasted for a couple of months. We now have $65 crude, but a MASSIVE deficit.
754 2018-06-20 22:12:50 the really funny thing about America is that if we put half as much money into fixing Central America as we did into fucking up the Middle East, the whole damn hemisphere would be great. But then again...oil.
755 2018-06-20 22:12:50 Let's see  - wheat flour (plant), sugar (plant), vegetable oil (plant). You're right, what could he have been thinking?

761 2018-06-20 22:12:09 What a horrible day for Canada. We will have to stay inside our homes when potheads smoke rotting leaves. The odor from pot is worse than that of tobacco because Cannabis smoke is vaporized oil and lingers and floats in air. This will create discord among homeowners. Thanks PM.
762 2018-06-20 22:12:06 Check oil
763 2018-06-20 22:11:51 Our corporations stripped them of natural resources, i.e. gold, oil & rubber, extracted the wealth & deposed elected governments in favor of less scrupulous actors who'd allow continued appropriation to continue in exchange for petty blowbacks. We *created* the conditions there.
764 2018-06-20 22:11:42 I'll take a stab at it....Flour (grain), sugar(corn syrup ) Vegetable oil.............it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck

770 2018-06-20 22:11:10 Get a Toyota instead of a @Ford. Ford would rather pander to Big Oil than save the environment for everyone.

773 2018-06-20 22:10:51 My fave bb cream is the oil free garnier one! It’s pretty good coverage, isn’t heavy at all. I like to top off with a little setting powder also

777 2018-06-20 22:10:10 USA usually cared about oil and installing governments that would serve them. As many other countries obviously, it's not the only guilty one. The fact is, those coutries had problems because of USA and USA have to help them now.
778 2018-06-20 22:10:09 RT @LivingSafely: Cheeze-It this June? Its top three ingredients are flour, soybean and palm oil with tert-Butylhydroquinone.
779 2018-06-20 22:10:05 Very important and necessary message. Whatever we feel is right, oil just cannot be turned off. It must be part of a transition to a new environmentally friendly economy.

Amazing to think that life is only oil and money  Hapiness is other thing  :is the way of life.
792 2018-06-20 22:08:31 CBD oil is expensive. That’s what sucks.

798 2018-06-20 22:07:48 I have been using castor oil in my hair and eyebrows and in the last month my hair has grown at least 1/2 inch! Which doesn’t seem like a lot but for me it’s major! My eyebrows have gotten more thick and full as well
799 2018-06-20 22:07:37 Tyre pressure on 7, no oil or water and let my petrol run down to none... who ever let me get a car
800 2018-06-20 22:07:31 No offence meant to any sales persons. Just the sentiment that he is a snake oil salesman.
801 2018-06-20 22:07:18 How much oil?
802 2018-06-20 22:07:11 omgggg.  ! no ones ever asked me before ! I use rosehip oil every night all over my face it basically supplies your skin with oil so you don’t need to produce it yourself. That stops greasy and oily skin which therefore helps prevents spots! I also do several scrubs daily xx
803 2018-06-20 22:07:10 We lost that leadership roll long ago and with good cause. The US is not about democracy and human rights around the globe. They are only about Hegemony and greed for Oil and Resources regardless of who gets killed.
804 2018-06-20 22:06:59 Do you have eucalyptus or ti-tree oil available? Great for removing the icky stuff from the benches
805 2018-06-20 22:06:58 I should’ve but I wanted to get my oil changed before and I didn’t get the chance. Just an all around failure on my part lol smh

Oil your oil with oil to oil your oil when you oil more oil out of the oil that's been oiled in oily oil.

818 2018-06-20 22:05:19 Also, if spices are ground up, a good practice is to mix them with a bit of water, then adding them into the oil, by the time the water evaporates the spices have been cooked properly and give a gentler more elegant flavour. Cheers!

830 2018-06-20 22:04:16 Summary 
Medium of exchange has to be equivalent... 
$1=₦365

Medium of exchange needs to have value or reference of actual value 
Eg 
Our economy is based on crude oil, if price of crude oil drops, our Naira drops and we'll suffer for it in the international market.

Or... just hand him off to the French. I hear they could use some practice with their "National Razor".
832 2018-06-20 22:04:06 I just use it like a serum! After I wash my face, I just rub the oil on my skin really well, and then I use my moisturizer on top of that

840 2018-06-20 22:03:09 here's what im wondering, though. Obama clearly earned a reputation among advocates as a "deporter in chief." And Trump went far beyond that.

YET

People are still coming illegally, and apparently in droves.

That suggests the problem is far more complex than our discussion
841 2018-06-20 22:03:07 Was that this morning or this afternoon?
842 2018-06-20 22:03:02 Actually I heard it first a couple weeks ago from some brand name energy hedge funds in NY. About five top PM’s were unanimous that oil is going to $100 in the next 6 months.

845 2018-06-20 22:02:56 Their brand doesn't even work that well. A lot of the oil gets stuck in there and you have to use a lighter to warm it up. Big hassle
846 2018-06-20 22:02:55 .@statedeptspox: "The United States strongly condemns the recent attacks by forces under the direction of Ibrahim Jadhran on the oil ports of Ras Lanuf and Al Sidra, and the ongoing violence that has damaged Libya’s vital oil infrastructure and disrupted oil exports"
847 2018-06-20 22:02:27 @info_nrt @tunajibu  For Kenya ... do you really think that the Northern Rangelands Trust and Tullow Oil and the sponsors of NRT practiced the principles of Free Prior and Informed Consent when they established conservancies throughout Kenya?

851 2018-06-20 22:01:31 Cannabis Oil yes indeed but we have to remember that there are other therapies too and Cannabinoids add a further bow string to the therapy of seizures and other disorders which is very welcome 
852 2018-06-20 22:01:31 Minnesota DONT BELIEVE THESE LIES FROM TRUMP. These Tariffs will ABSOLUTELY HURT YOUR POCKETS. Hes such an idiot with these rallys. No president in HISTORY needed riots to stroke his EGO, NOT even Bush ll. Hes a SNAKE OIL SALESMAN AND YOU GUYS ARE BEING USED!

858 2018-06-20 22:00:31 It serves to confuse ppl in other countries.  Some are released others not. So they still come. Mixed messages only exposes more to danger and hardships and costs us even more
859 2018-06-20 22:00:31 uploading it to GitHub takes the trophy PROPS. Btw nice tip, I would add that ppl should be careful with the spices when adding them straight into the oil, for a medium high heat, count til 7 then add onions (if in use or other veg) it will help to keep temp down.
860 2018-06-20 22:00:28 Who's this Chris Kostopoulos guy I always see in the replies for oil.  Dude sounds so giddy he makes Pierre Andurand look neutral
861 2018-06-20 22:00:27 I for one don't think it's fair that Provincial  oil & gas revenues 
(non-renewable) be included in a calculation but  renewable Hydro profits are excluded. 
This should be changed & done over time if necessary. IMO
862 2018-06-20 22:00:23 maybe she manually dug the Turkana oil wells...hope she gets a reasonable share of the oil money.

874 2018-06-20 21:59:33 I have to admit, as much as I didn't like or trust him, I didn't expect this. I didn't expect GOP would be so complicit. I didn't expect so many people to support this lying, snake oil salesman. I'm so hurt and insulted by this.
875 2018-06-20 21:59:30 No beard oil at all! I though just started trimming it more, I used to let it get more scraggly and then shave it all off. I also use a basic Kiehl's face wash when at home. Not much else!

880 2018-06-20 21:58:38 Do any of my followers use CBD oil for anxiety, depression, migraines/chronic pain? If so let me know how well it works!
881 2018-06-20 21:58:31 I know for my peanut allergy they tell me to avoid it but that ill probably be fine depending on the quality of the oil but idk i havent found enough info for almonds, only posts from mom's with kids with allergies that say they avoid just in case.
882 2018-06-20 21:58:24 Nothing is better than getting home and putting in beard oil and giving the ole girl a brush 
Idk why I shaved it off.
883 2018-06-20 21:58:20 Grand Old Putin party. Off to Russia to see how angry Vlad is that they couldn't get sanctions lifted. Maybe they'll try to get him to buy back the Rosneft Oil stocks he sold them.
884 2018-06-20 21:58:12 I am currently using it in two ways: I mix it with linseed oil and also pure on it's own with a medium 
885 2018-06-20 21:58:05 Death is so crazy and final. That shit really bothers me how you can be here one day then gone forever the next. That’s why we have to do everything in our power to buy Oil Of every pearl un-insides on iTunes
886 2018-06-20 21:57:36 BofA: "Tariffs + higher oil prices = "bad" inflation that could offset the consumption boost from higher wages/tax reform. We see stagflation as the biggest risk to equities"
887 2018-06-20 21:57:36 thank you! mine is just so untamed. Do you like use beard oil or is it naturally gorg?
888 2018-06-20 21:57:23 Americans became apathetic and relinquished our power by voting for snake oil salesmen. Electronic media overcame printed truthful journalism, so the truth became extinct. We see truth in outcome and that's too late.

891 2018-06-20 21:57:10 Glad it wasn't anything major or I'd would have had to junk it. I have no money doesn't anything above an oil change at this point

897 2018-06-20 21:56:34 No way, what’s happened.. not the oil pump again?
898 2018-06-20 21:56:27 Let's hope sanity prevails. I'm on horrible meds- Oxycontin & pregabalin for my severe RLS caused by MS lesions. Cannabis oil (with THC) would help me but it's not allowed. Utter madness. Let's legalise for ALL, control the quality & raise £billions for the NHS.
899 2018-06-20 21:56:20 I use peppermint soap and that usually clears up all my blemishes. Then I just lotion with and oil recipe my mum made.

903 2018-06-20 21:56:15 A lot of it I can't eat due to peanut sauce/oil. However I had reappy bland stuff tonight and the only thing I can think off would be msg. The odd take out aside, wd eat very clean so its a bit of a shock.

917 2018-06-20 21:54:21 Is CBD oil beneficial if you already smoke marijuana?

926 2018-06-20 21:53:06 Yes, because having oil drills or factories are much better. Personally, I always found wind tribunes to be somewhat elegant.

929 2018-06-20 21:52:55 First of all, the word “fascism” has an actual meaning. What you’re saying isn’t close. And if anything Obama was way light on BP, whose failure to act responsibly led to 5 million barrels of oil spilling into the Gulf ecosystem upon which millions rely for life & livelihood.
930 2018-06-20 21:52:54 Are you sure it was the ac making that clicking sound and not the engine itself? Because if the engine is making that sound, you probably don’t have any oil in it. It can lock up with no oil
931 2018-06-20 21:52:53 Ronnie Jackson is the name you're searching for. He's no longer at WH and was never associated with HHS. You ppl EVER do any research?
932 2018-06-20 21:52:44 Every time I get my oil changed I sit here and think about how much quicker it would have been to just do it myself. Yet, here I am again.
933 2018-06-20 21:52:42 Oh yes. The bengali soul kitchen trifecta: Paanch Phoron, Mustard Oil and Green Chillies. Deceptively simple. Also if I may suggest use single spices suated in mustard oil to make any dish. Will turn out fab. Ex: zeera in mustard oil with green chillies for dal + Haldi.
934 2018-06-20 21:52:34 Getting my oil changed (HAPPY, DAD??) and another guy here is unwrapping a brand new CD he just bought. This is adorable because 1) I didn't even know they sold CDs anymore, and 2) It's been a 10+ minute struggle to get the packaging opened.
935 2018-06-20 21:52:14 Take a hot bath with epsom salt and lavender oil. I did that the other day and my whole body was hella relaxed after.
936 2018-06-20 21:51:58 So upon reading the article, one blogger said it was bad while a coalition of 250 companies which contain more far more than just oil drillers praised the change. I’m not convinced this new order is good but your counter evidence is pretty weak
937 2018-06-20 21:51:53 I'm sure the orange ass hat brought his feed bag of shit and snake oil. The lying should be exceptionally exquisite tonight.

945 2018-06-20 21:51:02 I’m not sure how well it would fly/ work out, but I bet if lowered fed fuel tax, and in return put tariffs on foreign oil, it would help our economy/ oil companies.
946 2018-06-20 21:50:53 Bergamot Essence. Just under 40 bucks at Clicks or any pharmacy. Apply at night only after washing your face. You can dilute it as well (in a carrier oil preferably) - equally efficient kyafana.
947 2018-06-20 21:50:46 Then the farmers can provide Americans with Ethanol for car fuel by putting up cooperative stills! Especially now when oil prices are high!

953 2018-06-20 21:49:48 The USA has a finite amount of natural resources : fresh water for drinking and farming, farmable land, oil, etc. It seems the more persons allowed to immigrate into the USA, the fewer natural resources there will be for each American, and the poorer the average American will be.
954 2018-06-20 21:49:24 $1 a barrel royalties on oil sands projects until they were paid off. Millar western pulp was got a $150 million loan that was forgiven right before an election. That's off the top of my head.
955 2018-06-20 21:49:11 Oh, I don't know - subsidies to the oil patch (of which there have been many); royalty holidays; on demand cuts to corporate taxes under Klein; I could go on. The point is Calgary's downtown had the PC cabinet on speed dial for far too long.

958 2018-06-20 21:48:51 Cannabis Oil

CBD = the medicinal element
THC = the “high,” element.

Rubbish. A balance of both elements = a potent anti-oxidant and cleanses the body of harmful oxidants, the synthetic types used as food preservatives. 

CBD alone is useless as a medicinal treatment #Fact
959 2018-06-20 21:48:45 The same folks bankrolling libertarian movements in America are fighting against post-scarcity America. Do you think the oil industry wants cheap, renewable energy? How about defense contractors and hedge funds? 

They want to break the power of the state and assume it themselves
960 2018-06-20 21:48:03 Want to diminish stretch marks? Use Vitamin E oil and Cocoa butter. You can find both at your local drug store.
961 2018-06-20 21:48:02 My dog once bit me above my armpit which is like THE MOST Delicate and sensitive spot and it looked like I was hit with a bat  I recommend getting a natural oil! Rosehip, citrus, almond oil ect. It helps heal much faster

982 2018-06-20 21:45:31 Moscow is much more concerned about the stability of reasonably high oil prices rather than their constant growth that might encourage growth of oil output by rivals, boost development of alternative energy  resources and, in the end, shrink demand.~Nikolay Kozhanov

984 2018-06-20 21:45:13 The price of oil took a big hit last week. Following China’s announcement it quickly fell from $67 to below $64. The wave of sell-offs caused price to break out of its rising trend channel. This week, it may break back into its previous trend channel.  #dailynews #earn2trade #oil

992 2018-06-20 21:44:17 Mm I know peanut allergy people can consume peanut oil bc the oil doesn't actually contain the allergen...idk if almonds are the same
993 2018-06-20 21:44:14 Why wasn't BP oil sued during the Obama years, and the fake news didn't care either.....
994 2018-06-20 21:44:09 I am looking for INFORMATION!! Which ESSENTIAL OIL COMPANIES are free to join or less than $75

Also CANDLES Companies but not SCENTSY and Soap/ Bath and Body Companies!!

As I am thinking of starting a new business
995 2018-06-20 21:44:08 The light being on means that your oil is too low and needs more added ASAP or if you’re due for a oil change then just get the oil changed.
996 2018-06-20 21:44:02 Same but Trader Joe's olive oil popcorn.

998 2018-06-20 21:43:51 I use African black soap as a cleanser, and a neutrogena moisturizer, but my skin has gotten so much clearer and more balanced since I added in rosehip oil!

1001 2018-06-20 21:43:28 Meanwhile my country’s government is fucking around deciding wether we should allow the prescription of medicinal cannabis oil that can literally save kids lives with epilepsy. It’s illegal here, despite us being the biggest exporters of medicinal cannabis in Europe.
1002 2018-06-20 21:43:18 I admited earlier that "he drilled more oil and deported more illegal immigrants" Your President decided to break the families up! This article supports my argument.
1003 2018-06-20 21:43:10 Shampoo: Head and shoulders

1005 2018-06-20 21:43:05 A butcher in a meat-packing plant sounds like skilled labor. I believe  Bubba would need some training before he could try to pick up that job.
Waiting for ICE to go after stage riggers in border oil refineries.  Then we'll see how refiners deal with work delays.
1006 2018-06-20 21:43:03 UFA next year though! If the oil can sign him for a few more but he will be expensive! Have to clear up cap! If we could trade Lucic than we can! I like Looch but Artemi sure would fit that winger position!!!
1007 2018-06-20 21:42:38 Just witnessed a moth commit suicide by flying straight into a frying pan full of hot oil... that'll add some flavour to our steak
1008 2018-06-20 21:42:34 May I suggest to you another Road Not Taken? In 2000 we don't let the SCOTUS rig the election for Bush, we don't invade Iraq, we deal with Afghanistan responsibly, we kill Bin Laden sooner, & by conserving oil & switching to alternatives sooner we vitiate the Salafists' power.
1009 2018-06-20 21:42:21 I have a slight suspicion that coconut oil I’ve just bought is just for food and not for smearing your face with it but I cannot read Finnish and honestly I don’t give a damn and it’s organic anyway so

1018 2018-06-20 21:40:57 #PT Eng Mostafa Sanallah is doing great job based on the current situation in Libya, He met with his job description along side with the workers and did tremendous job to hike the oil production. 
What government do with oil revenues, this is not on his scope of job.

stop blame!
1019 2018-06-20 21:40:54 @MTPDaily Why did anyone ever not take him literally? MSM has given him benefit of the doubt way too much. He's what he's always been, narcissistic snake oil salesman. Now he's bankrupting democracy & the world.

1023 2018-06-20 21:40:27 Teaspoon of Warm olive oil in the ear and tilt head to keep it in for 10 mins, then rinse out. I’d rub gently in a circular motion just under the ear behind the lobe while the oil is in.
1024 2018-06-20 21:40:26 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
1025 2018-06-20 21:40:26 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1026 2018-06-20 21:40:25 @GordonRamsay Why does my ceramic coated greenpan say not to use olive oil? At which temperature threshold does it become unhealthy to cook olive oil?

1028 2018-06-20 21:40:14 Add salt, pepper in small amounts.  Then add plenty of coriander and cumin.  I like to do a wedge’s worth of fresh lemon juice to it.  Shape into ball/patties about a spoonful in size. Fry in oil of choice about 3-4 minutes per side, until golden brown and crusty outside.

Don't think media in Canada will  do coverage or analysis of Mex election. Potentially dangerous, esp for oil patch. If we only get shallow, drive by, 2-sec-on-CBC coverage we'll only get reruns of the discredited AMLO = Chavez line.

1038 2018-06-20 21:39:11 smart cats know that when the 45th president cries about #CNN being unfair, a depressed snail dies a slow emotional death
1039 2018-06-20 21:39:10 You’re a phony. A snake oil salesman. You’re no more an advocate for morality than many in Hollywood. You cherry pick your ethics from a 3000 year old book. If you don’t recognize Trump is the evil, you’re blind too.
1040 2018-06-20 21:38:54 Yeah I’m having the same issue. But in Puerto Rico my edges laid without wrapping much. I think it was the humidity. So oil moisture or shea mouse before
1041 2018-06-20 21:38:52 Estimate demand growth for oil to drop by only .5 %.   So yes the market will still be in a deficit in q3.
1042 2018-06-20 21:38:44 Juan is an idiot. Often wonder are they just playing a part or are they really as stupid as they look and sound?
1043 2018-06-20 21:38:18 John, you souless, cynical f*ck. Any Texan only needs to drive thru West TX to see how many undocumented workers your oil & gas buddies love to employ. Your silence up until it became politically untenable speaks volumes.
1044 2018-06-20 21:37:50 Republican love to meddle in countries and start wars when oil is involved  i.e. Middle East, You can’t meddle to help Central America solve the violence problem? How’s that for a solution?

1061 2018-06-20 21:34:50 100%
1062 2018-06-20 21:34:35 The USA has a finite amount of natural resources : fresh water for drinking and farming, farmable land, oil, etc. It seems the more persons allowed to immigrate into the USA, the fewer natural resources there will be for each American, and the poorer the average American will be.
1063 2018-06-20 21:34:35 @RoyalCaribbean terrible smell on deck 13 on #anthem.  Turns out there was an oil spill.  Some cabins compensated and others not.  Friends on that deck.  Not happy.

The USA is booming and canada is failing.  Get a real job out in the world and you will get a better education.
1068 2018-06-20 21:33:50 I need to go get a oil change
1069 2018-06-20 21:33:45 also, sunburn tip: get any normal mist type spray bottle, put distilled water in it and maybe 15 drops of mint essential oil in it. shake that bitch up and let it sit in the fridge for a few hours. once it’s cold spray your sunburn 3 times a day and that shit will be gone asap

1077 2018-06-20 21:32:55 Is it me or are all the reality shows just interchangeable now and merge into one? See an oil pulling ad on my tl and I’m like “yeah it’s him from Big I’m A Celebrity On A Love Island Shagging My Ex On The Beach To Win The Apprentice”

In relation to cannabis. I would prefer to take a good quality cannabis oil for my MS and Psoriatic Arthritis rather than the meds I do take with the long list of negative side effects. Wish the government would make it legal for medical use.

1103 2018-06-20 21:28:33 No not at all. Then you need to subscribe to their emails they send coupons all the time for discounts off oil changes, tire rotation. Etc. Haven't paid full price for one yet. I got my oil changed and tired rotated for $54 last time.

1129 2018-06-20 21:25:09 Bonita columna pero te cierras como ateo en el verdadero signíficado de #Globalismo, si bien vivímos en una era globalista o de reducción a la población mundial, AMLO no intenta extraer carbón como @realDonalTrump, más si impulsar el @Pemex, >out (sin)#OIL > $ = que peso
1130 2018-06-20 21:25:05 I got fucked like never before last night...had no aiming oil to calm my nerves and snapped that fucking controller...stupid ass game
1131 2018-06-20 21:25:01 Meal prep , some fat burners ? Cal, fish oil, green tea , watching your macros
1132 2018-06-20 21:24:46 Guardian story doesn’t add up! 800,000 bpd, but more than 1 tanker/day. Must be small tankers? Yes oil goes south now, but at a discounted price into USA so better profits for America.
1133 2018-06-20 21:24:41 Friends, don't leave your DoTERRA Lip Balm in the vehicles this summer! With ingredients like coconut oil and beeswax, it's sure to melt! 
1134 2018-06-20 21:24:32 I seem to recall oil prices going up, not down. We went over to that damn sandbox to fill the coffers of the oil tycoons, including Dubya's pockets.

Remember when gas was below $2 a gallon?

Pepperidge Farms remembers.
1135 2018-06-20 21:24:22 Yup. And if you're against it, it means your a Nazi. What? It worked in Europe.
1136 2018-06-20 21:24:18 US Politics tweets are more fun if you parse EO as "essential oil" rather than "executive order."
1137 2018-06-20 21:24:18 Ok so here’s my advice ladies: yes, eat that. No, do not text that boy back. Coconut oil..
1138 2018-06-20 21:24:15 Cut shipments of oil and natural gas to the US.  Take patents on Rxs.  If this trade war is going to hurt Canadian workers we need to double down and make it hurt Americans.
1139 2018-06-20 21:24:07 but juices are yummy and bergamot essential oil smells AH-MAZ-ING
1140 2018-06-20 21:23:59 Hey. When do I get to stop subsidizing oil companies and enriching the elite?

1142 2018-06-20 21:23:51 BE AFRAID!! BE SCARED!!! NOW BUY MY LEAD TAINTED SNAKE OIL! This fear based performance art for your easily scared and duped followers. Does it ever seem like your never going to satiate you and your cronies greed?
1143 2018-06-20 21:23:46 By all means make medicinal oil for sick people , but nothing else, afore you know it it’ll be as easy for underage kids obtain it just like alcohol.
1144 2018-06-20 21:23:34 You realize that BC also has extensive wineries and tourism, ON industry is highly diverse, QC has aerospace and manufacturing, dairy isn’t even top 5, SK has potash and oil. Literally almost every other province was better diversified than pre-NDP AB.
1145 2018-06-20 21:23:17 Disagree.  Though I’m also on the low-carb train.  In the USA, most Orthodox eat pbj and try to imitate non Lenten foods with vegetable oil and artificial crap.  Sure junior mints and Oreos are technically Lenten, but does that comport with the spirit of fasting? Cont.
1146 2018-06-20 21:23:08 Incomplete list of critical mistakes made by the NDP: 

- Messaging the carbon tax as an important step in obtaining “social license” from Woke Canada
- Appointing an uncompromising environmentalist to the Oil Sands advisory board
- Believing that Sandra Jansen is a net asset.
1147 2018-06-20 21:23:07 What new technology are you referring to? You certainly can’t be referring to #hydrogen #FCEV surely? Basic laws of thermodynamics & requirements of engineering design means that they remain a dead end. There’s a reason why oil companies are pushing hydrogen.
1148 2018-06-20 21:22:58 I dunno- I don't mind research evidenced stuff. There are a fair few blogs and resources knocking about that are snake oil.
1149 2018-06-20 21:22:41 En effet mais pourquoi ne pas aussi rappeler que la France est championne des énergies decarbonee... Grace à son nucléaire... , si deconsidéré et son hydraulique... en voie de privatisation

1151 2018-06-20 21:22:11 literally all I know is oil sorry!
1152 2018-06-20 21:22:06 I don't think he means that. I think more the amount you spend on avocados and beard oil.
1153 2018-06-20 21:22:01 @sajidjavid @theresa_may 115,000 of us are calling on you to legalise medicinal cannabis oil, promising a review is not enough. Public support is behind us, change this law and save lives! #MedicalCannabisNow
1154 2018-06-20 21:21:48 4 more days of putting olive oil drops in then I finally get my ears vacuumed Monday afternoon. Then I have to wait for my letter to say when I’m having my mri scan done hope it comes soon
1155 2018-06-20 21:21:47 Sure. I mean, vaccine manufacturers make a pittance and a mandate will mean they'll sell fewer antibiotics, antivirals and other drugs to treat the grass-fed organic kids who turn up at the ED with raging infections that crunchy momma tried to treat with hemp oil, but sure.
1156 2018-06-20 21:21:46 A surrealist oil painting
1157 2018-06-20 21:20:54 My skin is clear but im trying to see how yall being getting that glow.... is that from the oil or what??
1158 2018-06-20 21:20:30 I’d like to thank the old man who talked with me a Walmart for 10 minutes about the olive oil mafia.
1159 2018-06-20 21:20:26 Are they confiscating firewood and cooking oil too? #fryup #fishfry #officialsurwa
1160 2018-06-20 21:20:24 The CSKA top boys are probably on some oil rig in the middle of an ocean right now, rigged up with machine guns guarding some mobile nuke device.
1161 2018-06-20 21:20:23 20% of the World's surface fresh water is in our Great Lakes.
It is the Last place we should be digging for oil!

Keep us informed. We will freak the F out if Trump tries to drill here!
1162 2018-06-20 21:19:52 Why don’t I see it? All I see is rising health insurance costs, rising gasoline prices, sky high heating oil prices this past winter, and job openings thare eother very low pay, part time, or poor benefits! In addition to some companies having taken the money and laying off.
1163 2018-06-20 21:19:40 @StephenNolan Should Billy Caldwell’s mum declared that she was a director of a company that sells cannabis oil?
1164 2018-06-20 21:19:39 Olive oil
1165 2018-06-20 21:19:38 Literally same, except I won't be 2 months late for another 2 months(which will happen I'm sure, usually does), and I usually go like double the distance since my car burns the oil faster than the filter dies, so It gets cleaner oil more often
1166 2018-06-20 21:19:32 朝起きた時点で足裏の筋が切れそう
1167 2018-06-20 21:19:29 Day 2 of taking black seed oil and I can already lift a refrigerator  wit my dick 
1168 2018-06-20 21:19:28 That was when US didn't import huge amounts of oil and didn't sell trillions of debt to other countries. If you export debt, you have deficit.

Currency is backed by real value. Etc.. Gold, crude oil etc. 

Nigeria's economy is so mismanaged that it has no bargaining power in the international market. 

so u see.. It's not the material.. It's the worth.
1171 2018-06-20 21:19:17 I still am surprised the crap food (cookies +) and also some baked bread with palm oil. As said read labels as I NO BUY if has Palm Oil. Thanks for the reminder.
1172 2018-06-20 21:19:13 I REALLY JUST STARTED MAKING THESE BROWNIES AND MY DAD USED ALL THE VEGETABLE OIL TO FRY HIS DUMBASS CATFISH AND NOW ALL WE HAVE IS CATFISH OIL GOODBYE

1180 2018-06-20 21:18:26 Put him on an high raw alkaline diet, give him herbs, and cannabis oil! All three are far more effective than chemo which only has a success rate of 3%
1181 2018-06-20 21:18:08 You take such good care of us even when your butt has oil and dead skin accumulations.
1182 2018-06-20 21:17:55 Bush started war in Iraq for nothing or 'oil', Nixon was impeached for the watergate. We can compare bad presidents all day long but the point is what he's doing NOW is wrong and your country is never going to be the same with this much hate and no empathy for others.
1183 2018-06-20 21:17:47 Trump & others know the demographic trends suggest Mexicans will take back CA & TX.

I say take back because the land was stolen.

Some may say illegal immigration is expensive but I say the gold, oil, & natural resources that were stolen from Mexico more than covers it.
1184 2018-06-20 21:17:46 I have really oil lids :/ I used to do that before too!
1185 2018-06-20 21:17:44 They cannot be detained indefinitely.  The law says so.  Leftists lie every chance they can.  
We need judges and planes. If these people end BACK up in Honduras within 2 weeks they will quit coming in mass numbers
1186 2018-06-20 21:17:42 Put on @JaneMonheit’s cover of “Sing A Song” today. The tempest in my chest began to settle. 

Bitter conflict shreds us, and that’s why art us so important. 

It runs down your brow like healing oil. Clears your mind. Reminds you of the million ways you love your neighbor.
1187 2018-06-20 21:17:36 I’ll listen to him cus his country has its ish together, a bigger landmass than we do supplies most of the electricity to NYC and is our only land bridge to Alaska which houses our oil reserves.
1188 2018-06-20 21:17:31 Did I just witness the all-time worst Subway order? Dude went turkey bacon flatbread (fine) with lettuce, tomato, pickle (whatever) MAYO, RANCH, MUSTARD, SOUTHWEST SAUCE, OIL/VINEGAR, PARMESAN

C'mon man, you can't eat that.

1191 2018-06-20 21:17:19 Man, please. The word Democrat is all you need to know...this dude wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight.
1192 2018-06-20 21:16:39 Thank you! You are the only ones I allow to change the oil.........the folks in Athens, GA are so friendly and quick.....and honest.
1193 2018-06-20 21:16:08 Wait what. No it’s skin care.. I promise I don’t have nits (because I use tea tree oil)
1194 2018-06-20 21:15:35 I use their green spray oil but I haven't tried any of the other products. I'ma give it a try.
1195 2018-06-20 21:15:27 Just saw my sister tryna fry chicken but the fire was too low and them thin ass chicken breast was basically soaking in that oil. Wanted to tell her but she the type that don’t listen to nobody ;(
1196 2018-06-20 21:15:14 Coconut oil is so bad for most people’s skin!
1197 2018-06-20 21:15:09 I’m not looking for anything serious in a relationship now I’m just trying to get my oil changed.
1198 2018-06-20 21:14:47 using monoi oil on my hair: a good move
1199 2018-06-20 21:14:47 The draft began in 1940, and Roosevelt's Lend-Lease program helped keep Britain and the USSR in the war starting in early 1941. The Japanese attacked after the US froze their assets and cut off oil and steel. Soviets mostly stopped Hitler, but Dodge trucks hauled their supplies.
1200 2018-06-20 21:14:47 try using carrot oil! it should help even it out when you tan
1201 2018-06-20 21:14:44 Lemon or lemon oil!
1202 2018-06-20 21:14:41 Can you use olbas oil that is over a year out of date. I’m struggling here.. 
1203 2018-06-20 21:14:34 They cannot be indefinitely detained.  The law says so. This is a lie.
Catch and release and unlimited immigration is the real goal.  Left just places obstacles in the way of enforcement of law.
1204 2018-06-20 21:14:25 Bayelsa contributes 30% of NG's oil revenue, the engine that drives this unjust contraption

Bayelsa & indeed all the 36 impotent states should not have to wait hand & foot on a FG created to serve the Regions but has usurped their authorities & Autonomies

This is NOT Federal..3
1205 2018-06-20 21:14:21 Nizoral Shampoo and @nutiva organic coconut oil is all she needed for everyone to stay alive. Quite unfortunate.
1206 2018-06-20 21:14:17 Hes giving CPR while checking his oil
1207 2018-06-20 21:13:37 It's nothing like witch hazel. Coconut oil is not for oily irritated skin. It's for dry skin,& for skin moisture. My face only break out if I eat wrong or touch stuff and then touch my face then I result to witch hazel. Gotta clean ur face constantly tho.

1214 2018-06-20 21:12:22 I'm promoting #Hempwillsavetheworld for 80 million you'd actually see real change in the world. Hemp would eliminate the timber industry, begin to fracture the oil industry, and along with it's cousin Marijuana begin to unhinge big Pharma. Or do I buy a nice suit and lie to you?
1215 2018-06-20 21:12:06 Hi lily. He also said one thing while he was in office that I found pretty disturbing considering the size of the US forces. he said (I don't know why we are dealing with these people in the middle east, if we want oil or anything, we could just go in and take it)
1216 2018-06-20 21:12:01 Greaaaat spilled some oil on my pants
1217 2018-06-20 21:12:00 But Rouda was just a republican and switched. That’s pretty opportunistic. He also supports big oil. Doesn’t seem like a good democratic candidate to me.
1218 2018-06-20 21:12:00 and republicans against it and @realDonaldTrump will get republicans to win the midterms with an extraordinarily clever "immigration" debate. Again, rallying people against and go something. He's genius
1219 2018-06-20 21:11:39 If u haz honey, you can swap out the sugar for it! 10x more awesome. And a small splash of sesame seed oil if you hv that too
1220 2018-06-20 21:11:35 .No, we will no longer be the stupid country whose pres is supporting the God damned liar, Netanyahu, who has lied over & over & over & over & over again abt M.E. countries' nukes, so U.S. bombs/mass murders innocents, manages the protection of SYRIA'S oil for PSYCHOS' PVT CORPS!
1221 2018-06-20 21:11:29 What else do they have?  Higher taxes?
1222 2018-06-20 21:11:18 I'm sure nothing nefarious happened, like Roy Moore coming through wearing nothing but chaps and a light coat of oil, or anything.

1227 2018-06-20 21:10:47 I put some red onions in it and parsley. Vinaigrette was olive oil, white wine vinegar, yellow mustard, garlic powder, salt, pepper and a little sugar. Who measures? Ha!
1228 2018-06-20 21:10:38 Then my point is proven. The middle class does not have control over water, oil, land, or energy they have to pay for it, they aren’t allowed access to certain knowledge or formats, how so is it that they live now how the pharaohs have lived in their existence?
1229 2018-06-20 21:10:32 Yeah WE won it. Whether it was for the Iraqi people, oil, whatever you believe, we still won it. The proof is Saddam was killed and there was relative peace until we left. So yeah we won it. The point is in the original tweet and you’re proof
1230 2018-06-20 21:10:27 Gav just FaceTimed me in target parking lot and walked me through how to check my oil

1243 2018-06-20 21:09:39 The GAO has issued a report on oil and gas lease suspensions on federal lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management. The report (GAO-18-411) is titled "Oil and Gas Lease Management: BLM Could Improve Oversight of Lease Suspensions with Better Data and Monitoring Procedures".
1244 2018-06-20 21:09:39 Their oil is about to run out. Then who will be interested in this backward boys club?
1245 2018-06-20 21:09:33 Ok, you provide a graph minus oil and Edinburgh financial sector. Also I'd like to see GDP for Fife and Ayrshire. You can't pick and choose bits of a country. Scotland GDP / UK GDP are recognised data. Why is Scotland's GDP always lower than UK since 2014? No answer = hypocrite.
1246 2018-06-20 21:09:32 The women are no oil paintings hun. I must be one of the few who could see psycho Rosie for what she is. Adam's had a lucky escape.
1247 2018-06-20 21:09:25 Yeah I've been accused of giving my son that. I know nothing about it and have never used it. But we've tried some other treatments you might consider snake oil.

1253 2018-06-20 21:08:38 Eating donuts doesn't cause diabetes itself,it is the fat you pile on eating them,both the oil they are fried in and the sugar they put in it/on it, are calorie dense and trigger you getting fat, and that screws up insulin.
1254 2018-06-20 21:08:37 I was gonna say pine oil and suicide watch.
1255 2018-06-20 21:08:36 Quite a contrast - a system that allows a rogue dr to administer lethal opiate based medications yet won't allow non lethal cannabis oil.
1256 2018-06-20 21:08:33 I think the same benefits can be reaped though the plant other than smoking it (plant oil, etc.)But since testing those solutions has been verboten, we don’t have a lot of information on it yet.
1257 2018-06-20 21:08:29 Such an arrogant hypocritical snake oil salesman
1258 2018-06-20 21:08:26 Back from picking up daughter & her S.O. @ Oakland airport.
Now to get oil changed, needed this since back from Portland.
See....adulting can be fun! NOT!!...
1259 2018-06-20 21:08:25 I know.  I hate being ashy.  Keri... I’ll have to try it.  I’ve been using Curel.  Thinking about giving Eucerin a try.  BUT, the body oil is nice.
1260 2018-06-20 21:08:24 Fresh pineapple helps. Medical Cannabis helps a whole lot. As does CBD oil. I take it daily. Any activity aggravates the pain. If I make dinner and water the garden. Or go see stand up comedy or see one of my doctors. I'm barely moving and in more pain for a day or two after.
1261 2018-06-20 21:08:20 @FairQuestions Loved your presentation at the Calgary Public Library today, on the foreign funded interference in the Alberta Oil Sands, as well as the Canadian Elections of 2015 and 2017.. 
So much information, well presented, well researched. Keep it coming.
Thank you! #cdnPoli
1262 2018-06-20 21:07:57 Amazing presentation today by the fabulous (and funny!) @FairQuestions on the real story behind Canadian oil protests. @CanadaAction #oilandgas
1263 2018-06-20 21:07:17 @AsimSupreme I took your advice, I’ve been washing my face with your black soap & following up with the aloe vera oil for about 2 weeks now and i can definitely tell a difference 
1264 2018-06-20 21:06:43 I use oil
1265 2018-06-20 21:06:34 Try tea tree oil.
1266 2018-06-20 21:06:22 I just drove to @kroger to buy spinach dip, tortilla chips, and diet ginger ale. This evening will be #THC oil in my vape and snacks. THANKS, KROGER!
1267 2018-06-20 21:06:16 Appreciate the reply. I’m fully aware of both sides of Palm Oil debate inc local community dependency. ‘SustainablePalm oil’ is still a very moot point + its a completely replaceable ingredient. Better to remove it entirely & avoid the doubts.
1268 2018-06-20 21:06:10 #TeamTolex abeg all this story of oil money pH boys ship should rest first the street was really rough today. Tolex I stan

1276 2018-06-20 21:05:18 He did propose doing away with tariffs. 
Trump deraingment syndrome prevented many from hearing him.
1277 2018-06-20 21:05:08 Several of Alberta’s biggest oil and gas companies have been granted intervenor status in the constitutional reference question filed in British Columbia over the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project.
1278 2018-06-20 21:04:58 Agreed, but if demand for oil is steady, that is an indication that oil usage is flatlining, which indicates other sources of energy are being used to replace it
1279 2018-06-20 21:04:56 Yeah he keeps messaging me asking if I want a 9.99% interest rate and free oil changes for life

1287 2018-06-20 21:04:24 “(Digital) data is the new oil” says Justin Varney @DrJV75 if @PHE_uk at #CAHPO18. “We take it, refine it and sell it back to the masses. When we spill it, it’s the biggest PR disaster you can imagine”
1288 2018-06-20 21:04:23 So i told my mama about black caster oil, she said she went to the hair store looking for “Black cholesterol” and couldn’t find it. Well i know why

1292 2018-06-20 21:03:55 I think we should also point out that this is actually domestic abuse and the women had blisters from the hot oil around her eye and a bruise/black eye.  the concept is entertaining but the event isn’t. Not an attack btw! Exciting but also sad.
1293 2018-06-20 21:03:54 I need somebody to oil my scalp lol
1294 2018-06-20 21:03:53 Still plenty of summer left. Northern hemisphere still warming. Land and sea. I never fully understand why we don't adjust the working day instead of the clocks.

1296 2018-06-20 21:03:44 There are hundreds of people working on Monero, which leaves me free to point out how Dash is centralised garbage and complete snake oil.
1297 2018-06-20 21:03:40 Sadly, ND bullies label pretty much everything snake oil. If we went point by point on treatments we'd probably disagree on what is "snake oil"

1309 2018-06-20 21:02:32 This is disgusting and shameful.         A mother who has been campaigning for a law change on medicinal cannabis is the director of a company that sells cannabis oil.

1315 2018-06-20 21:01:47 .Funny! That's what I say about "the families", who are right now trying to steal Syria's oil and gas, genociding w/their private corporations, the U.S. & NATO militaries. Then "the families" send the refugees to us, depopulate, make the rest 1, all ripe for their God damned NWO.
1316 2018-06-20 21:01:45 Thanks to the truck driver who didn’t tie his load properly. He dropped two barrels of crisco oil on 452. 

I wish I could find a joke in this, but it took me 45 minutes to go three miles.

1320 2018-06-20 21:01:06 The only way to protect the environment is to leave oil in the ground

This is really a master-stroke... By the ruling party.....
1344 2018-06-20 20:59:25 I take issue with "snake oil" because that's a term used to dismiss and denigrate. We've done ABA, speech, OT & used psych meds all with limited success or meds actually made things worse. Working with a doctor who ran tests to determine how my sons body is functioning has helped
1345 2018-06-20 20:59:14 Alternatively, you can use milk of magnesia as a primer
It kind of soaks up the oil on your face, and you can go the whole day without needing to blot when you use it

1356 2018-06-20 20:57:55 Well I thought I was getting free oil changes under my warranty. No. I was very wrong and now I need to get another one and I don’t want $43.78 to be taken out of my bank account.

1375 2018-06-20 20:55:21 sorry but people who still say that we shouldn't end friendships over politics can fuck off if u support trump then u support all his decisions that segregate families, discriminate against minorities and ruin whole countries for oil

1377 2018-06-20 20:55:17 They have an awkward roster, a bunch of guys not hitting, weak bullpen and somehow a team that to this point is overachieving (and would be in a wild card atm) has its fanbase wanting to kill the coconut oil loving manager for some reason.

1380 2018-06-20 20:54:55 .Trump didn't start the fire. Pres Obama, Bush, Clinton+ all do what Trump does: whatever "the families" want. Trump ALSO bombs innocent ppl to steal their oil & gas for giant oil companies that "the families" own. You too can think on a continuum instead of being a '0' or a '1'.

1400 2018-06-20 20:52:23 okay but the real tea is that there’s absolutely nothing wrong with loving a little garlic, flaky sea salt, fancy olive oil, cherry tomatoes, cilantro, lime, hot cherry peppers, or fresh basil and that’s that!
1401 2018-06-20 20:52:18 PM: the only way to protect the environment is by creating economic growth. We have to manage the transition to clean energy while opening up new markets for our oil. #hw
1402 2018-06-20 20:52:06 I had a container of coconut oil in my backseat and I totally forgot it was back there and it spilled all over my backseat :((((((((
1403 2018-06-20 20:51:57 Don't. As much as it's rare to be hit from behind, it doesn't mean it doesn't almost happen regularly... Tailgaters really should be able oil slicked.
1404 2018-06-20 20:51:55 Thank you for the help  Always thought it was some sort of gel  Baby oil is already here so I'm good to go 
1405 2018-06-20 20:51:51 So many on the far right have lost the right to ever call yourselves "pro-life", or civil or decent.  The references to the lead-up to Hitler are apropos.  Many of u turn people's stomachs.  Even repubs in congress know it's wrong.  Ppl have left ur party. Shameful.

1409 2018-06-20 20:51:17 Hi I don’t think consumers are possibly happy that you use palm oil, full stop. Presume it’s some sort of preservative? Think most people would want “no palm oil” & people paid to preserve rain forests
1410 2018-06-20 20:51:09 I wanna change my oil but idk what this weather is about to do.

Wars waged on other countries for corruption/oil whatever it is in the name of democracy and mainstream media feeding propaganda. What will it take?
1538 2018-06-20 20:33:00 Agreed, that would lower oil prices worldwide so the Middle East can't get their monies from oil

1576 2018-06-20 20:28:45 Do you refer to your Dad in third person all the time or just trying to get public attention that you did nothing till the public started attacking your ethical value & hypocritical values. Don't think all of USA hasn't noticed your dirty deals with China for profit from office.
1577 2018-06-20 20:28:43 Hard pill to swallow, just because you’re in the military doesn’t mean you’re a good person. Also, we haven’t fought for freedom in awhile, it’s all about the oil now.
1578 2018-06-20 20:27:53 sound like this may be a paid for by oil companies story
1579 2018-06-20 20:27:50 just saw someone put on facebook that Scotlands the only country in the world where you can see oil tankers and foodbanks... Socialist Venezuela has the biggest oil reserves in the world but has people dying of starvation everyday...
1580 2018-06-20 20:27:47 No it's not, military spending meaning take our bombs, missiles and Jets to Israel, continue to bomb more countries for oil, resources and give Jeff Bezos a big fat paycheck for his CIA surveillance programs by spying on Americans in the United States.

1583 2018-06-20 20:27:01 That's so delicious. Nothing like a judge pulling your opponent's pants down. I was in a 13-year legal fight in re offshore drilling. Tentative ruling went to our side.

1589 2018-06-20 20:26:16 Yes, you are of course right. Either way, refining (into fuel or some other useful product) is what we need to do. It is absolutely false that there is no demand in Canada. STOP importing foreign oil and then tell me there is no domestic demand

1591 2018-06-20 20:25:36 3. to either go against one if it's biggest allies in UK and buy oil (internationally considered stolen) directly from Iran  (even though production was at a near stand still due to Iran's lack of trained personnel). Or Iran was going to go to the Soviets for help and to sell.

1650 2018-06-20 20:19:12 Choose cream or ointment over lotion
Use an ointment or cream rather than a lotion. Ointments and creams are more effective and less irritating than lotions. Look for a cream or ointment that contains an oil such as olive oil or jojoba oil. Shea butter also works well.

1671 2018-06-20 20:16:23 Look up the oil cleaning method! You use one part castor oil and two parts a hydrating oil (avocado oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, grape seed oil, etc) it’s saved my acne prone, dry, sensitive skin!!
1672 2018-06-20 20:16:02 As much as the girls look , I literally could not be arsed dressing up EVERY evening  I’d rather be smoothered in coconut oil, aftersun, just chilling in my pjs  #LoveIsland
1673 2018-06-20 20:15:54 Well, oil up your walker and head on out.
1674 2018-06-20 20:15:45 And how does it feels when the same India buys oil from ur arch enemy Iran and helps them bypass the sanctions u so miserably tried to imposed?
1675 2018-06-20 20:15:42 AND their industries rely on fossil fuels. I believe they're also heavily invested in oil (in Canada?). So they are vehemently against environmental regulations & are big supporters of corrupt EPA head Scott Pruitt. I believe this is why he still has a job.
1676 2018-06-20 20:15:40 Lemon and honey pon the face for 30 minutes! Rinse! Bio oil rub in! Until this sunburn fucks off to Pluto
1677 2018-06-20 20:15:38 You too 

I'm excited to get the oil on canvas painting that someone found in the Red Cross donation shed framed. I was given it because the person who found it thought that I would appreciate it more than anyone at the Red Cross would. Excited to finally snap some pics of it.
1678 2018-06-20 20:15:31 Ladies if you’re ever sore due to rough sex, I strongly recommend cbd oil post sex (down there obvi). Works quick to relieve pain. #sorrymom
1679 2018-06-20 20:15:18 When I have a headache, I use a good Peppermint essential oil on my temples and it helps.
1680 2018-06-20 20:15:03 Cut in 4 and fry in olive oil
1681 2018-06-20 20:14:59 Fyn My Oga,I just rem as u dey control ABU gehs

1683 2018-06-20 20:14:55 Essential oil Class has had to be Cancelled for this evening. We will reschedule this class as soon as possible. Our apologies for any inconvenience!
1684 2018-06-20 20:14:54 These girls are more fried than the eggs in the canteen this morning. There is a thing as too much oil.
1685 2018-06-20 20:14:53 oh well, I only do intermittent fasting like 5 times a week and cheat a couple times and still have great results in how I feel/look so *shrugs* also I'm 99% positive the bulletproof dude uses coconut oil while fasting so I guess fat is okay in some instances? honeys bomb too :)
1686 2018-06-20 20:14:53 Shilling for trump and being honest mix like oil and water.
1687 2018-06-20 20:14:51 put it in the blender with some olive oil, vinegar, and some other spices to make salad dressing.  Some I dehydrate to use over the winter.
1688 2018-06-20 20:14:47 Has anyone ever gone to get their oil changed without being badgered into getting 75 other services done??
1689 2018-06-20 20:14:40 Today I loathe everything about coffee, I don't even drink it. After spending my resources on that case I said I'll never spend a dime to  oil the treadmills of these eternal blood suckers!! I'm off to bed.
1690 2018-06-20 20:14:06 A thermometer could help but really you can see when frying goes wrong. (Like the frosting oil gets foamy, or starts smoking)
1691 2018-06-20 20:14:01 Have you tried castor oil?
1692 2018-06-20 20:14:01 Yeah they really do. Even Koch bros who the left hates would like nothing more than an EU style union of North/South America with free movement of ppl and goods. That is open borders
1693 2018-06-20 20:14:01 Very good decision by the US, as Turkey is just on the verge to become a new terrorist country like pakistan.Who is right now killing Kurdish people, who allowed finances to isis through oil sale, Turkey once who talked about modern n moderate islam is now fundamentalist islamist
1694 2018-06-20 20:13:58 It's all about haircare for me! When I lived #stateside I was allergic to basically all toiletries  I washed my hair just with bicarb and apple cider vinegar ... Since coming home it's all solid shampoo bars and a smidge of coconut oil #zerowastehour
1695 2018-06-20 20:13:58 Oil pan is no where close enough to the ground to be an issue
1696 2018-06-20 20:13:57 さて、これから池袋→富士に帰ります。
1697 2018-06-20 20:13:44 Robert Hill rotates his tires every oil change
1698 2018-06-20 20:13:40 Getting my oil changed is stressful they might as well just ask “do ya wanna change ya diddlebop contraption” because that’s all I hear and my answer will always be no
1699 2018-06-20 20:13:39 Nigerians will bring holy water first and anointing oil before touching that bird.
1700 2018-06-20 20:13:29 先週のショーのときにキッサ君に借りた、独立記念のコインがとても使いやすいです。ぶっちゃけ銀貨より断然良い！
1701 2018-06-20 20:13:21 Cause it was founding on genocide and slavery, ran by big oil n pharma that don't care for their people... so time to decolonize.
1702 2018-06-20 20:13:12 D fact that you're arguing a case for a terrorist Organisation is even sickening,every struggle involves loss of life,did Abiola not die for his Presidential struggle?u drill oil from their land & even portable water they don't have,but u want them 2 b lookin at ur installations.
1703 2018-06-20 20:12:33 Until illegals have more rights than citizens the liberals will not be happy. Dems need them for votes and that is all they care about.
1704 2018-06-20 20:12:32 Coconut oil
1705 2018-06-20 20:12:20 @DaphneOz refined or unrefined coconut oil does it matter??
1706 2018-06-20 20:12:19 Castor oil
1707 2018-06-20 20:12:18 That hot oil treatment got my hair feeling so good 
1708 2018-06-20 20:12:10 I think my future husband will be terrified of me always walking around the house with black face masks and also white ones that make you look like a ghost and my hair wet af from that coconut oil he’ll probably be like what the actual fuck
1709 2018-06-20 20:12:01 So, we should release the children to sex traffickers and pedophiles oil Obama did. You're disgusting and fake empathy is not missed by conservatives.
1710 2018-06-20 20:11:36 Tonight, #SubEnergy Vice Chairman @RepPeteOlson and @RepBillJohnson host a special order on the House floor on the importance of increased production of U.S. oil and gas in light of next week’s World Gas Conference. #WGC2018
1711 2018-06-20 20:11:32 #USA has no business there. They belong with other brutal dictatorships which they support crimes against humanity. All that matters is oil, geopolitics and dollars, not #HumanRights .

They should start their own #InjusticeLeague  or #LegionOfDoom with their new friends.
1712 2018-06-20 20:11:14 A good, high quality Peppermint essential oil could help.
1713 2018-06-20 20:11:13 Thought I was witnessing a proposal outside the fancy olive oil store in Grand Central but it turned out to be a man untangling his hair from his girlfriend’s fly—unless it was both!?!?!
1714 2018-06-20 20:11:13 just aloe vera and lavender essential oil. i actually wanted to put some vitamin e in too but couldn’t find it anywhere

1722 2018-06-20 20:10:35 A good, high quality Peppermint essential oil could help...
1723 2018-06-20 20:10:27 Dear mutineers if you don't like me, pretend that you are A donut and roll into the oil reservoir and die
1724 2018-06-20 20:10:20 Gotta go buy an Oil Pressure Test Kit after work.  Got a bad feeling the "fresh" built engine in the 71 Camaro is coming out soon.  Sure hoping it is just a bad gauge though.

But..she aint named Jinx for nothing!

1729 2018-06-20 20:09:45 Beard oil recommendations. Let me know!
1730 2018-06-20 20:09:42 Never buying BBQ sauce again after making it myself! Its so much better knowing exactly what goes in without all the oil and chemicals 
1731 2018-06-20 20:09:41 Yes and i have told you it was in surplus for years before the credit crash and oil issues, can you not accept that there was a surplus for decades? Lets also mention contributions to things we don’t want, trident etc we would not have issues with over spend managing our own tax
1732 2018-06-20 20:09:31 I actually slipped in oil at the LAX Airport Hilton parking on the first morning and when I told the hotel and the reason I was there they sprung into action. They went to the garage to check it out and the person parked near me who was STILL STUDYING IN THEIR CAR practically
1733 2018-06-20 20:09:27 It’s time for an oil change 
1734 2018-06-20 20:09:24 Omg mushrooms and cheese omg that’s lit and lots of olive oil
1735 2018-06-20 20:09:11 That’s interesting. I left the Republican Party in 2002 after we started a war based on oil.
1736 2018-06-20 20:09:06 Your a future felon ......by the way what weight of oil do you use in your hair 10/30....10/40 etc etc
1737 2018-06-20 20:09:06 There’s baby oil and baby powder, too. No waste in the baby stuff industry.
1738 2018-06-20 20:08:49 Sheet masks or peel off mask! Skincare infused with cbd oil  lip plumper  lip masks just like your under eye gels  body exfoliate to use before the Brazilliance Plus + self tanner  a brightly colored eyeshadow palette  jumbo colored eye pencils  #tartetalk
1739 2018-06-20 20:08:49 You must understand that the wind, solar and hydroelectric power are called ¨renewable¨ energy for a reason. You can´t run out of ¨sun¨. 
But we will run out of coal, oil and gas. 

The push is a long-term strategy. Did I mention we Democrats think LONG TERM?
1740 2018-06-20 20:08:41 Pretty sure @TheDailyShow would be less gleeful if it was one of their being kicked out of a restaurant (or having their food spit in by republicans).
1741 2018-06-20 20:08:39 YOU are a VET... why don't you work on fixing THAT mess??  Not as much there you can use against Commander Trump?  Can't sell them any oil?  What??
1742 2018-06-20 20:08:29 The weirdest thing I’ve experienced during a concert lmao. I was in between the girl with the oil and the group of girls she was aiming at smh. They were all mid twenties too, which made everything funnier.
1743 2018-06-20 20:08:26 Reason has become less reasonable and less readable.
1744 2018-06-20 20:08:18 For the past 2 weeks, every time I’ve made money in oil or natty, I’ve shipped it right back with gold.
1745 2018-06-20 20:08:15 Just ordered a 2 pack!

I have two severely autistic children, and both of them have really bad anxiety as well as sleep issues.

I've been considering fiving CBD oil a try for a while now, but when @EdLatimore endorsed it, well, that was the last straw! 

I had to try it!
1746 2018-06-20 20:08:01 Thanks Sephton for booking a Oil Filter Housing Gasket Replacement with #Fiix for your Honda!  #Scarborough #Toronto #Tech
1747 2018-06-20 20:07:58 We are in innovation mode at The Billionaire HQ, we are excited to launch 3 new products. Beard/Hair Shampoo, Beard/Hair Balm Conditioner, and a Unisex Body oil called omNY coming soon!!!
1748 2018-06-20 20:07:57 Looks beautiful! Will you bring it in tomorrow? Let me know if you need any essential oil samples x
1749 2018-06-20 20:07:35 one of my friends dogs had seizures and i think they got her some CBD oil .
1750 2018-06-20 20:07:35 Have you tried wax remover (that blue oil) I have experienced that with one, the Hollywood one in the pink packaging
1751 2018-06-20 20:07:20 This sounds like a good thing. Can't let the people who are selling the thing tell us it's health benefits. It's like the snake oil days.
1752 2018-06-20 20:07:04 I did an oil change years ago. Never again. What a mess. Said I’d leave it to the pros. Also, it’s my wife driving it, so I want it looked after.

Not because I love her and want her safe, it’s because I want to reduce the chance of earache if it goes wrong lol
1753 2018-06-20 20:06:59 Avocados are awesome. Slice and drizzle with some olive oil and light salt and pepper. Yummers!
1754 2018-06-20 20:06:57 My cat will let me turn him upside down, push him over, bite his belly, barely complains at a jab at the vet, let her trim his claws... I put moisturiser on his neck and you’d think I’d poured boiling oil over him! He has been sulking for 3 hours...
1755 2018-06-20 20:06:56 It’s easy to hold up a sign. 
Let’s see them stop or reduce their oil consumption. 
Leftist-environmentalists are the worlds greatest hypocrites.
1756 2018-06-20 20:06:47 what happened? what did America gain? you oil slicked bunghole. the best part of you ran down one of your mom's legs. I don't know which wife it was or care, but you are ugly inside and out.
1757 2018-06-20 20:06:45 Might already have done it but aloe? Always works for me. Or vit e oil. Hey good at healing. Have to keep both around for exactly this.
1758 2018-06-20 20:06:40 Currently 90% rye bread and olive oil. Which means it's summertime.
1759 2018-06-20 20:06:38 Baby oil!
1760 2018-06-20 20:06:24 Same. Felt like 101 today.i was not happy about having to walk back and forth across the long ramp to put oil in the plane today

1763 2018-06-20 20:06:13 Hawaii was a legitimate military target. It was a remote military outpost. We deliberately stationed our fleet there to counteract Japanese movements in the Pacific. We placed an embargo on their supply of oil. Anyway, I didn't say they shouldn't be defeated. I said that nuclear
1764 2018-06-20 20:05:58 That bloody illustration of 400 cal oil; 400 cal chicken; 400 cal veg. Infuriates me every time someone posts it
1765 2018-06-20 20:05:58 Looks like anyone of them would mug my grandma 
1766 2018-06-20 20:05:47 A lot of misinformation about on medicinal cannabis. Folk don't seem to realise that clinical trials need to be run to prove a medicine is safe and effective. Not buying oil of dubious strength off the internet with unproven medicinal claims.
1767 2018-06-20 20:05:45 Ima be so mad if my momma don’t bring my oil home
1768 2018-06-20 20:05:43 Why not give the military a job that does not involve blood for oil or opium? Why not have them work for the public good with infrastructure projects? The dictator then could not unilaterally attack a foreign nation for no reason. #tuckfrump
1769 2018-06-20 20:05:42 *slapping tea tree oil on my face* acne retire bitch
1770 2018-06-20 20:05:31 Btw Hotel Chocolat doesn't appear to use palm oil. At least not in all the copious chocolates I've looked at recently. A good-to-know fact!
1771 2018-06-20 20:05:26 Clue: it helped Nazi Germany build one of its largest oil refineries. One which supplied the Luftwaffe with fuel & only ceased production in 1942, when it was bombed by the allies.
1772 2018-06-20 20:05:08 Alhamdulillah you?
1773 2018-06-20 20:05:06 i put my hands on that “long hair don’t care” oil by babe essentials
1774 2018-06-20 20:05:01 I suspect I may be an oil market Ewok. People put up w me 
1775 2018-06-20 20:05:01 You know five bucks and an application can get pretty much anybody ordained. That’s why there are so many snake oil salesmen running around claiming to be holy.
1776 2018-06-20 20:04:53 He wants putin at their door. He wants the world run by dictators, and you applaud that. giving up on democracy for a slimey snake oil salesman. He will turn on u faster than a speeding bullet for a dime. He is cheap, selfish and doesnt care about us. Stop being blind.
1777 2018-06-20 20:04:45 Use an oil free eye makeup remover. The Mary Kay or Lancôme one. I keep the MK one in my kit at all times, that stuff works miracles!
1778 2018-06-20 20:04:41 Sadie said mamaw I need some oils and tried about 90% of them. Decided on the oil FUN today.
1779 2018-06-20 20:04:33 Countless animals are slaughtered and displaced by crop farming.  Crop farming uses significant amounts of water, oil and chemicals harmful to humans.  It is far from either economical or ecologically efficient.
1780 2018-06-20 20:04:22 There is the girl in her and she is getting impatient. She kept looking at her phone and saying I am on a tight schedule and now she is saying she hasn’t gotten an oil change in a long time...Really...You need to take care of your car.
1781 2018-06-20 20:04:21 America went to Iraq because of the Oil. America went to Afghanistan because of the Opium. Honduras and El Salvador have no money making resources to protect so they are on their own.
1782 2018-06-20 20:04:15 Is this the same Fonda who told President Barack Obama about the oil spill and attacked him as a "fucking traitor" for allowing "foreign boots on our soil,
I take it Fonda doesn't like foreigners then.
1783 2018-06-20 20:04:01 I'm hoping it's an Olive tree or it was labelled wrongly when I bought it 2 months ago.... but let's see.....

1786 2018-06-20 20:03:52 Ooo, I see what you did there.
1787 2018-06-20 20:03:48 Feeling better. Gonna finish the laundry and make essential oil products
1788 2018-06-20 20:03:35 Curry is the best food, but it's even better with chili oil.
1789 2018-06-20 20:03:32 SAUDI OIL NEW YORK is SONY
1790 2018-06-20 20:03:17 Pretty hypocritical, that a man who sells CBD oil, something linked to marijuana that so many people are in jail for has these arguments in response to locking children in cages.  I’m sure you’re looking for future customers, they’ll need it from the trauma, depression & anxiety.
1791 2018-06-20 20:03:17 It's been 1,000 days since the BP oil spill and the Gulf of Mexico still has not been restored.
1792 2018-06-20 20:03:12 An anointed ministry built on a weak organization will stop the flow of the oil.

1793 2018-06-20 20:03:09 Coconut oil 
1794 2018-06-20 20:03:08 Hillary and The Bible are like oil and water
1795 2018-06-20 20:03:07 I know I really like to strip everything off, do my makeup, oil myself up, and then lie on my bed with my cat with a stainable white shirt around my oiled bottom. Oh, and then allow pictures to be taken of this momentous occasion
1796 2018-06-20 20:02:59 Body oil isnt soap u nasty mfs
1797 2018-06-20 20:02:55 Groupon is good for an oil change lol save me $50

1799 2018-06-20 20:02:37 I just spent 40 minutes tanning, and I’m still white  ( I used tanning oil too)
1800 2018-06-20 20:02:32 Hello, James! Yes, you can use just about any toothpaste with the DiamondClean 9300! However, we do recommend against using toothpastes with essential oils (like clove oil, peppermint oil, etc.). We hope this information helps :)
1801 2018-06-20 20:02:24 U need oil shawty
1802 2018-06-20 20:02:10 Makeup removing oil! Julep has a good one!
1803 2018-06-20 20:02:07 I once mixed olive oil and sugar, rubbed it on my palms to make my palms soft. It worked for like a week but I stopped applying it coz I didn't know the health risk involved.
1804 2018-06-20 20:01:57 They're not "young boys", but they are minors, and he's sneaking around the airport taking their photo then splattering it on the internet. Creeper weirdo. Leftists are bizarre.
1805 2018-06-20 20:01:38 When they don't talk about oil and money they usually have a short memory
1806 2018-06-20 20:01:38 Today in 1976 David Pearson in the @Purolator Mercury won the Cam 2 Motor Oil 400 @MISpeedway. @woodbrothers21 #NASCAR
1807 2018-06-20 20:01:35 Being the most corrupt President of all time does not denote integrity or class. A smooth talking snake oil salesman really fooled the low info voters I see. Trump keeps his promises on what he ran on. Winning!

1809 2018-06-20 20:01:11 More judges and swift deportations within 20 days will solve this.  If you pay thousands of dollars, travel thousands of miles and are back home in 2 weeks, less will come.

1813 2018-06-20 20:00:44 I can't work where fracking is banned as it happens regularly in UKCS offshore reservoirs from oil rigs

1819 2018-06-20 20:00:02 They add hydrocolloids (xanthan) and sugar to gel it up. If you don't mind the texture, xanthan is at least very heat stable. 

Much better though to make your own mayo, and just use higher ratio of egg/oil. Will produce a "light" mayo with better taste and texture w/o sugar.

1823 2018-06-20 19:59:18 All I’m saying is as a layman.Westminster is downplaying the oil reserves when new finds are being discovered every week. We are the largest producer of oil n Western Europe. We would have a lot of leverage as an independent state and the taxes from it would go directly to us

1828 2018-06-20 19:58:10 How fecked is our system that this snake oil salesman ever made it into parliament without being screened first? 
1829 2018-06-20 19:58:08 I got my body oil in my eye and now it’s bothering me...

1831 2018-06-20 19:57:46 Oh, I have that problem too.
If water by itself doesn't help, I use coconut oil for those extra pointy hair days. ^^
1832 2018-06-20 19:57:37 That is not why they are up. They are up because of oil prices.
1833 2018-06-20 19:57:36 Magdalena River in Colombia?  Have you observed the railcars carrying oil down the Thompson and Fraser Rivers?
1834 2018-06-20 19:57:35 it's amazing how I get more of a tan walking around in a t-shirt, than laying out in the sun covered in tanning oil, trying to avoid a t-shirt tan.
1835 2018-06-20 19:57:28 We are paying less oil price to these countries. उनकी इकोनॉमी डगमगा रही है इसलिए वहां महंगाई हर चीज़ में बढ़ी है। हमें उनके देश में दाम से क्या मतलब। वैसे तो दुबई,कुवैत,बहरीन,सऊदी में पेट्रोल हद सस्ता है भई!
मुद्दा ये है कि हमलोग और बाकी देश oil price पर कम खर्च कर रहे हैं न। 
1836 2018-06-20 19:57:24 Holy fuck, those are some huge babies

1838 2018-06-20 19:57:23 notice also all the Q-bies have kinda calmed down, they aren't biting at your ankles.

the con is getting a makeover...

1846 2018-06-20 19:56:23 So I told my mom I got offered a job at Kulture and the first thing she said was  “Do it so you can get me discounts on CBD oil” don’t worry mama I gotchu
1847 2018-06-20 19:56:21 @Trulieve you guys are great at asking and answering questions when it benefits you guys but it someone like me to get screwed out of $60 because your oil leaked everywhere you never answer me back no messages calls or anything

1854 2018-06-20 19:55:27 I agree. What is wrong with america these days, stupid, blind, being ripped off by a snake oil salesman who is racking in $, but wastes r tax dollars.
1855 2018-06-20 19:55:17 If you admonish an author for promoting a book while the world's a dumpster fire, I hope you also admonished the guy who sold you coffee and your kid's daycare teacher and the person who changed your oil and, you know, the millions of other people who still have to work.
1856 2018-06-20 19:55:06 Someone is going to sue because the EO is in violation of the law which states that children cannot be held with their parents in federal confinement. The EO will be set aside and the dems start to bitch again.

1868 2018-06-20 19:53:26 Worked out. Got my oil changed. Tires rotated and signed up for all my fall classes. It’s been a good day:)
1869 2018-06-20 19:53:21 Why do oil changes take sooo damn long!!!!!! 
1870 2018-06-20 19:53:20 Seems it is too runny? Lie oatmeal in my diaper. Usually just mix raw oats, warm water and a bit grape seed oil. Put diaper on, pour mix down the back and close up. Now I want to do it soon again. It’s been a while. :-)
1871 2018-06-20 19:53:14 You could slice and do it in a gratin with tarries Or as a wee side dish for fish or pork. Small cubes and steam. Then dress with olive oil, lemon juice, parsley and season. Or shred and salad it. A wee bit of a cross between radish/cabbage

1877 2018-06-20 19:52:13 1/2 cup white vinegar, 2 Tbsp baking soda & lemon essential oil.

Mix the vinegar, oil and a little water before adding baking soda in a clean spray bottle. Then fill to top with water. I use about a 12 oz bottle. Gently shake to mix ingredients.

1880 2018-06-20 19:51:50 Like the best case for reducing GHGs is convincing people to stop using oil, and that will happen when they are given plausible replacements for their current activities, and it’s never going to happen by just shaming people into stopping.

1890 2018-06-20 19:50:45 Rosemary oil? 
1891 2018-06-20 19:50:45 Try chasteverry tablets or evening primrose oil. Thy are both supplements and are safer than the conventional O.C. Pills
1892 2018-06-20 19:50:43 lmaooo whenever i get an oil change the guys come up to my window and say "here's your old oil and here's your new oil" and idk what any of that means or what it looks like when it's dirty so i always just say "okay" cause idk what else to say lol

1909 2018-06-20 19:48:27 I had to go back another day to get the conditioner! But I use the coconut oil and ylang ylang one. Smells so YUMMY!!!  and makes me hair so soft! 
1910 2018-06-20 19:48:25 I need a lifetime supply of beard oil ASAP
1911 2018-06-20 19:48:19 An Indipendent Scotland would prosper with such tax revenues.
Oil? Who needs it...
1912 2018-06-20 19:48:14 A pit down by the railroad tracks? Now that appeals to my Kerouac sensitivity! Can imagine us old farts gathered around an oil drum fire with roaches ablaze, recalling Nixon & playing wicked air guitars!
1913 2018-06-20 19:48:07 Maybe this will shock you, but coffee is the second most traded commodity in the world after crude oil. Its so sad and mind boggling trying to understand this kind of fuckery where the coffee farmer is living in extreeeeeme poverty

1919 2018-06-20 19:47:53 1500 miles around Scotland was so much fun The 3 has decided she needs an oil change, new diff oil, a repair to the windscreen and new front discs and pads.

I am not convinced at all. #ImbewuTheSeed

Me: “Sir I don’t think this is.... nvmd thanks for the Soy sauce”
Hassan: “Bro I’m so down for hot oil”
1922 2018-06-20 19:47:38 Done sir
1923 2018-06-20 19:47:18 Taken some wind out of the pro illegal alien advocates sails, for now. 
But , they won't stop and this order encourages more to come. 
What we need are more judges and planes.
1924 2018-06-20 19:47:17 They came from Saudi, a country our government will never travel ban bc of oil
1925 2018-06-20 19:47:01 Hmmm.  Maybe I should move there...keep our numbers up.  Just don't want downwind to oil wells.  The capital is lovely.
1926 2018-06-20 19:47:00 I've ordered a teapot with integrated strainer so I can stop using teabags.
And I'll be switching to bars of soap, shampoo and conditioner, ideally without palm oil.
My life is so exciting.
1927 2018-06-20 19:46:58 They: you can't just add sesame oil to everything
Me, already unscrewing the lid of the sesame oild bottle: open sesame
1928 2018-06-20 19:46:57 And, tbh, I think renewables and water will become more valuable than oil.
1929 2018-06-20 19:46:56 Little does he know that most of us who bought his snake oil and voted for him aren't voting party lines in November. He's shown us what a jerk he is and we don't want anything to do with it!
1930 2018-06-20 19:46:55 My president, @CyrilRamaphosa, I think we can trade all our vuvuzelas for all of Iran’s oil... They might take that deal.

1932 2018-06-20 19:46:33 Specifically, licensing was handled by the Oil & Gas Authority, established by the Energy Act 2016. The OGA inherited the functions of the Hydrocarbon Licensing Directive Regulations (1995) which took over from the 1934 Petroleum Act, which gave all powers to the Crown.
1933 2018-06-20 19:46:30 I remember when I had my last oil change & the guy told me I needed new windshield wipers & @AngryKingston told me “no I will replace them”. Well guess who just drove home in the rain with broken wipers because the penny pincher never changed them
1934 2018-06-20 19:46:28 @RichieAllenShow like frying food,the high temps caused the oil to lose an electron turning it into acrylamide a high carcinogen
1935 2018-06-20 19:46:27 does it work good? because the olive oil one doesnt work for me
1936 2018-06-20 19:46:26 $2 billion? How can Alberta be in debt that much with all the oil royalties coming in?
1937 2018-06-20 19:46:19 by the way next time use vegetable/olive oil, non-skim milk or something with alcohol in it, water makes it worse
1938 2018-06-20 19:46:04 & I put herbal oil on my face as a moisturizer
1939 2018-06-20 19:45:56 Two new Mirah products:  Luminous Hair Conditioner and Oil Facial Cleanser.
1940 2018-06-20 19:45:47 See in that case, if I was an activist trying to reduce GHG I would be pressuring companies and governments to throw money at battery development rather than EV subsidies.

Like if your goal is to get off oil, why wouldn’t you put your money into your biggest chance of success?
1941 2018-06-20 19:45:46 If I dump a gallon of oil on my kitchen floor, are you going to lick my balls because I cleaned it up?
1942 2018-06-20 19:45:23 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!

1946 2018-06-20 19:44:49 @realDonaldTrump  Idiot. The oceans and sea life are changing. Often killed off by oil spills, pollution, etc. And some day most of the planet may be ocean, so good to work on that.
1947 2018-06-20 19:44:49 Maybe it’s down to quantities made. Or they think that people with oil are minted 
1948 2018-06-20 19:44:46 Stir with a bottle of oil.
1949 2018-06-20 19:44:38 What are you currently using?

1950 2018-06-20 19:44:30 Hell Yeah I grew up on it!! But If I added lemon, pepper, olive oil, and salt would you eat it?
1951 2018-06-20 19:44:29 Turkana has oil now , the revenue must now be used to help the people build up the area , schools, infrastructures just like they do in Qatar and uae  .
1952 2018-06-20 19:44:07 Less than 20% of crude oil is used for fuel, oil is used in over 6000 everyday household items. It'll be a very long time before there is no need for oil....certainly longer than 2035.
1953 2018-06-20 19:44:06 baby oil just adds an extra nut factor to the entire situation
1954 2018-06-20 19:44:02 Same. And my oil diffuser. Alas. Me and these sinuses have some issues
1955 2018-06-20 19:43:56 24 x 18 inch Oil on canvas. £280. For a signed limited edition canvas or fine art paper print please message me. Prints start at £40
1956 2018-06-20 19:43:37 person on my strange addictions: I’ve been drinking a gallon of gasoline every day for the past 40 years!!!! I think I should go see a dr soon cause I’m starting to get some migraines )):

me: i accidentally ingested a few drops of tea tree oil and my throat almost closed up
1957 2018-06-20 19:43:37 I can tell I need an oil change with how fast this tank o gas went.

That and the dinging reminder.
1958 2018-06-20 19:43:30 Turtle Jelly Bomb does not contain almond oil, but almond oil is present in our manufacturing facilities.  If you have a severe allergy, we're unable to guarantee our products are safe for you to use. 
1959 2018-06-20 19:42:57 @Clyburn I appreciate your efforts to help the innocent lives that sought no trouble just a safe place to make a home.  We must remind @realDonaldTrump, his grandmother was here illegally and his grandfather fled Germany to escape the War. POTUS family did what he is denying.
1960 2018-06-20 19:42:54 manufacturing deficit now at all time high (overall deficit not, b/c of oil -- but west texas isn't the region of the country that is mobilized by Trump's rhetoric on trade).  don't think it is quite fair tho to say this has no cost on US - smaller trade deficits would help
1961 2018-06-20 19:42:50 Yeah, it’s good to rub them down with a good coat of mineral oil every year or two … keeps ‘em glossy and prevents the wood from drying and cracking.
1962 2018-06-20 19:42:50 The pre cleanse balm is probably the most problematic product I’ve ever used... product separates and gets everywhere  please @DermalogicaUK  do not discount the pre cleanse oil!!!!!!
1963 2018-06-20 19:42:38 I think someone needs to oil the brass section #xmcab
1964 2018-06-20 19:42:37 I dont understand how they have a moral highground after slavery, kkk, etc. All of americas worst history belongs to the democrat party.
1965 2018-06-20 19:42:27 If you can’t remove your fake tan after it’s become patchy buy exfoliating gloves and some baby oil. Scrub your body using the gloves and the baby oil. It more or less comes off straight away, you’re welcome x
1966 2018-06-20 19:42:25 I’m glad I’m not the only one who thinks this  Spaniards look at me sideways when I say it, but the oil from the churros alone literally feels like it’s clogging up my chest loool
1967 2018-06-20 19:42:25 But wait when jadhran stoped oil production the first time he was #hater buddy and was hailed as a saviour of #libya wealth !!!!! But I guess relationships don’t last 
1968 2018-06-20 19:42:21 Y’all fish oil supps  I’m really feeling a difference when I take them
1969 2018-06-20 19:41:50 "Earlier, the President poured oil on the fire in a meandering speech to a group of small business owners, in which he accused the media of helping child smugglers and suggested undocumented immigrants are criminals and gang members, after tweeting earlier that Democrats
1970 2018-06-20 19:41:49 It's a roman lamp ? Oil or scent
1971 2018-06-20 19:41:33 So when we return from Great Oil Spain HQ the nights will be drawing in 
1972 2018-06-20 19:41:30 STOP MAKING SENSE!!
1973 2018-06-20 19:41:14 A good name is better than fine oil, and the day of death better than the birthday.
1974 2018-06-20 19:41:09 Look like m ago move to Guyana and try get all this oil money.
1975 2018-06-20 19:41:04 Yah ne
Things at Maluju oil have quiet down drastically. 
I am sure Zakithi has a plan to turn things around. #ImbewuTheSeed
1976 2018-06-20 19:41:02 Clean & clear morning burst & i only out coconut oil on my face 
1977 2018-06-20 19:40:58 Getting my poor babies oil changed today. Way overdue and that’s what travel’ll do to you. #rhymin
1978 2018-06-20 19:40:52 He's a snake oil salesman. And, a damned bad one at that.
1979 2018-06-20 19:40:45 #imbewutheseed Zakhiti must leave Maluju oil 
1980 2018-06-20 19:40:37 Lemon juice, and olive oil mixed with sugar. Repeat everyday. = Glow. 
1981 2018-06-20 19:40:34 ＢＢひでえよ…(泣
1982 2018-06-20 19:40:32 Oil changed  tires rotated  car washed 
1983 2018-06-20 19:40:28 Thanks @codyincalgary for bringing in @FairQuestions to show the money trail and election influence from US...with economic goals of land locking Cdn oil & gas under guise of environment lobby.
1984 2018-06-20 19:40:28 #Epilepsy there are between twenty to forty percent of people who have Autistic Spectrum Disorder who also have epilepsy. I am wondering if the Cannabis Oil would be available to them to control their illness.
#AutisticSpectrumDisorder #CannabisOil #Seizures #Neurological
1985 2018-06-20 19:40:26 I always feel like an idiot when I get my oil changed. They ask me questions about my own car that I guess I should know... then the next visit I’m like I still don’t know your answers. At least I can change a tire, right?
1986 2018-06-20 19:40:20 Took me two weeks to finally come get my oil change  I need to stop slackin
1987 2018-06-20 19:40:16 The US is 50% libertarian, so any uprising would have to change government as well as the corporations that control government. The simple change, as all ideologies are, would be stop cheerleading corporations on, and just weed out the bad ones, like big oil.
1988 2018-06-20 19:40:16 I am going to England for holiday soon and although I won't take any with me I will tell everyone I can about the benefits of marujana. I especially recommend cannabis for clinical depression, chronic pain, insomnia, anxiety and poor appetite. Cannabis oil shrinks cancer tumours.
1989 2018-06-20 19:40:15 600 dollar window for 3500, and a 500 dollar rebate helps only snake oil sales
1990 2018-06-20 19:40:12 If this ties to an oil concern or legacy automaker, you are looking at the next "dieselgate"-sized scandal.

I wish we could come up with something other than tacking "-gate" onto the end of a word in order to denote a scandal. Can we go back to "affair"? It worked for Dreyfus
1991 2018-06-20 19:40:10 知ってる？大学って大して重要じゃないんだよ。焦ってる暇あったら油、飲も？
1992 2018-06-20 19:40:10 Family Nutrition: #Cheeze-It this June? Its top three ingredients are flour, soybean and palm oil with tert-Butylhydroquinone.
1993 2018-06-20 19:39:52 1000% this. What a freaking snake oil salesman.
1994 2018-06-20 19:39:38 We have been reporting oil leakage from the transformer in our yard,  we called eskom several time.  Today  a part of my home burnt down. @Eskom_SA
1995 2018-06-20 19:39:33 It's the law and has been the law. Just because it has been indiscriminately applied in the past doesn't make him responsible.
1996 2018-06-20 19:39:23 maybe if you were to wash all the oil off your skin then maybe we’d be the same 
1997 2018-06-20 19:39:18 I ordered medicated coconut oil and cbd tinctures

REALHEALTHSHIT
1998 2018-06-20 19:39:05 u can cook something without  oil.
1999 2018-06-20 19:38:44 I overheard a y3 child in the corridor today saying ‘it’s ok to eat chocolate as long as it’s made from sustainable palm oil!’  Happy dayz 
2000 2018-06-20 19:38:37 Disgusting it's like the population of orangutans being destroyed at a rapid rate due to illegal logging and Palm oil plantation's
2001 2018-06-20 19:38:31 There has to be an essential oil that works!! Have you looked into that?
2002 2018-06-20 19:38:26 whereby they convince themselves that the snake oil is working and attack and fight anybody who points out that it doesn't as an agent secretly working for the enemy ( persecution complex )

nothing we can do to help these people ...

fuck them :)
2003 2018-06-20 19:38:25 No new taxes, except the internet tax or any other @GOP dictated one for her campaign funds

No government comiss., except for oil/fracking or other pro business ideas

Less federal intrusion, except she is a loyal soldier for Trump

More transparency, except she dodges nonRs ?s
2004 2018-06-20 19:38:25 Initially. I worked in lean Manufacturing for years. You innovate, automate and drive costs down and quality up...or get out of the way for those who do. I think of when Reagan deregulated oil the costs initially skyrocketed. Historically speaking we are paying very little today.
2005 2018-06-20 19:38:10 So many of my friends use essential oil’s and this is just amazing look at what we just found....

2007 2018-06-20 19:37:59 COW　Crude Oil Washing 原油洗浄
2008 2018-06-20 19:37:53 how would oil spills be prevented in a libertarian society?
2009 2018-06-20 19:37:52 Why let foreign Christians and muslims enter your country at all? Block them entering through all airports. Stop Modi flying to other Christian and Muslim and communist countries. And finally, DO NOT buy crude oil from the Muslim countries.
2010 2018-06-20 19:37:49 Wonder what double standard the democrats will be offended about next week. In the UK this week it was "up skirting" and marijuana oil and next week will be another campaign with no thought of the end result.
2011 2018-06-20 19:37:45 As an example, under commodity fetishism, sacred Native American land or ecosystems rich in beauty and biodiversity are simply resource's for mining and oil companies to plunder.
2012 2018-06-20 19:37:13 @BarackObama I'm politically to the right of John Wayne. Ronald Reagan was too liberal for me. I tried to reach across party lines when you were President. You were kind enough to answer an email about completing the oil pipeline.  Time to help Trump with immigration. Thank you.
2013 2018-06-20 19:37:09 its not that oil is running out - it now has a sell by date , and thats 2035 and 10- 15 years afterwards as cars using combustion engines die off.

Its why its imperitive to get that now , if we want a Sovereign ECO NFP power company formed from the money from it.
2014 2018-06-20 19:37:01 お疲れ様です
気をつけて行ってらっしゃいませ！

俺もそろそろ出社っす！
2015 2018-06-20 19:36:47 Now we just need an army of judges to hear cases and a fleet of planes for deportations. 
If within 10 days they were back in Honduras the flow would slow
2016 2018-06-20 19:36:25 US #oil #inventory volume as of 06/20 was 426.5 million #barrels, down from prev. week by 5.9 million bbl or 1.4%; down from prev. year by 16.2.0%
2017 2018-06-20 19:36:05 my grandmas hype as fuck to get CBD oil and it makes me happy
2018 2018-06-20 19:35:58 Usually demand doesn’t increase when you’re moving away from something. The demand for portable CD players isn’t increasing thanks to iphones. Demand for oil is pretty damn steady.
2019 2018-06-20 19:35:57 Oooo Karen, this sounds like a great idea! “Cider oil” could be the new thing!
2020 2018-06-20 19:35:52 Once at work I spilled an entire container of boiling hotdog oil all over my arm
2021 2018-06-20 19:35:50 @LizClaman  Uh oil tariffs are on imports not exports . So why would say $xom want an  exclusion of USA tariffs on China??They don’t import from China
2022 2018-06-20 19:35:45 CBD oil is being made legal in the UK now too and talks are in place to make it legal recreationally just like Canada. God bless the queen.
2023 2018-06-20 19:35:44 He's kidding right?? Trump and compassion is like trying to mix water with cooking oil....
2024 2018-06-20 19:35:43 How can you claim to be Native American but work on an oil pipeline LMAO 
2025 2018-06-20 19:35:38 New Hood Oil just dropped.  Come on and try Snoops Dream for $16 out the door.
2026 2018-06-20 19:35:24 A regular oil change is all I need, the same kind I’ve been getting for years. #nothingextra #nofilters #nogastreatments #noextramileageoil JUST A BASIC OIL CHANGE PLEASE & THANK YOU!
2027 2018-06-20 19:35:23 Today I learned that even if a coconut oil container appears to be plastic, you should always check for those little metal scanner bastards. Nearly set the microwave and house on fire 
2028 2018-06-20 19:35:23 Stormy mate, unless your wife has a bran new car, or a complex sports car, why don't you service it yourself? Brakes, Spark plugs, oil change are very easy to do!
2029 2018-06-20 19:35:16 And Canada is the monster taking in the refugees the West is happily making with their oil intervention in the Middle East. (Okay, not just oil interests. The arms dealers of the world are in enthusiastic favor as well)
2030 2018-06-20 19:35:07 The squeaky wheel gets the oil. It pays to be vocal and persistent!
2031 2018-06-20 19:35:00 La @coparmextabasco anunció la primera Expo Oil and Gas en Tabasco; se realizará en marzo de 2019 y se prometen al menos 500 empleos directos e indirectos para el sector petrolero.
2032 2018-06-20 19:34:56 Alright chain saw people - can you use SAE-30 instead of Bar Oil?
2033 2018-06-20 19:34:55 Now lets talk about the UKs problem, no trade deals, no trade allies, dont export anything, massive net importer of food, water, energy and oil, £4 Trillion debt incl liabilities, Sterling is a volatile mess, public services are falling apart, industry and business fleeing.. etc.
2034 2018-06-20 19:34:37 Dude VAT has already implemented in some of the Muslim countries from this year.They have already started diversifying their revenues couple of years back and becomin less reliant on oil income.Lastly just to prove our point there is no need to drag ne religion #justasking
2035 2018-06-20 19:34:23 oh my gosh, such hysteria LMFAO go take a chill pill Maybe you missed that oil corps like some of these measures as it helps them get oil to tidewater, something your party couldn't do, except piss off communities.
2036 2018-06-20 19:34:21 Mix a couple drops each of lavender, rosemary, and peppermint (or eucalyptus) oil with grape seed or fractionated coconut oil, then massage into your temples and the back of your neck. Also, baking soda, water, and a few drops of lavender oil = DIY linen spray.
2037 2018-06-20 19:34:19 Snake oil salesman, don’t you have done scared old white people to grift?
2038 2018-06-20 19:34:06 @GM I own a 2012 Equinox that has service bulletin on it for excessive oil consumption.  Yet, your people can’t fix even though the warranty is good.  Why should I ever buy another GM?  Why can’t you own up to the service bulletin and fix it?
2039 2018-06-20 19:34:03 There is no oil West of Shetland, or in the Minch, or the North Atlantic shelf, none at all and even if there is its no worth having we might find some after Indy though
2040 2018-06-20 19:34:02 The lough u gave there it is showing ur foolishness, ever visited countries where ppl just suffer becox of US policy USA is main source of terrorist becox USA greedy of oil. Soon they will make war zone for water too.
2041 2018-06-20 19:33:44 Castor oil really helps with hair growth and also taking vitamins helps a lot more
2042 2018-06-20 19:33:26 @CarolineHirons I've developed adult eczema, I'm basically one big itch  there are so many conflicting home remedies online; baths oils, rosehip, coconut oil, oatmeal..any you would recommend?
2043 2018-06-20 19:33:17 No compensation. No future use of oil/coal/gas or bio. All captured carbon should stay captured, incl that captured by photosynthesis, whether now or long ago. No burning. With luck we may still be able to limit climate change. If not, that's it.
2044 2018-06-20 19:33:15 All of CPC voting against making communities safer and holding oil corps to strong standards for pipelines and processing plants #cdnpoli @CPC_HQ don't care about the health of canadians, only lining their pockets with dark money from Koch bros
2045 2018-06-20 19:33:12 I would add a bit of sesame oil there if I wanted a bit more of a smell. But that's just my suggestion.
2046 2018-06-20 19:33:04 Why can’t I be 25 with a husband living in a villa in Tuscany drinking wine and dipping bread in olive oil and staring at the sunset
2047 2018-06-20 19:33:03 Oil change well needed
2048 2018-06-20 19:33:02 Oil to pan
2049 2018-06-20 19:32:56 I'm using clip studio paint (formerly called Manga Studio).  It's the basic oil paint brush set that comes with it.

2051 2018-06-20 19:32:41 Alaskans own 403,952 shares of CONOCOPHILLIPS, worth $20,145,086. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in UNITED STATES.
2052 2018-06-20 19:32:40 Miya vo oil koi free me ni aa rha h paisa khrch kr k ata h kisi s bheek mang k ni laya jata....Or मिया इतनी हमदर्दी मुस्लिमो से किस लिए हो रही है कोई पारिवारिक सम्बन्ध तो नही ह न
2053 2018-06-20 19:32:37 You heat frying oil (believe me, it's much better), till it's... Not boiling but just, you know, slightly moving, just before it goes full boiling
2054 2018-06-20 19:32:27 Was so tired when I came home from work last night I spilt baby oil all over my bed sheets and some how managed replace them with vinyl table cloths
2055 2018-06-20 19:32:19 Don’t forget the potential oil.
2056 2018-06-20 19:32:12 The Middle East has always been a problem to themselves, read the history of the tribal wars fought way before Islam came to be. The west just did a good job of taking the later blame because of oil. Religion or not, it's a political game of interest.
2057 2018-06-20 19:32:12 Inseurance renewal 
Registration renewal 
Tags renewal 
Oil change 
Wrist renewal ... pending 
Watch out peeps I’m back on the road
2058 2018-06-20 19:32:12 It’s all about the oil 
2059 2018-06-20 19:32:08 If you had over 1 million low skilled ppl with 6th grade educations breaking in it would be a different syory.
2060 2018-06-20 19:32:04 my coconut oil is officially fully melted. it’s summertime, bitches
2061 2018-06-20 19:31:58 When you're anti oil why would you care about auto business. Justin can say its Trump's fault.
2062 2018-06-20 19:31:56 You know your pregnant when you’ve had enough of Jamie Oliver’s healthy eating food shows, and you switch to @jamesmartinchef....throw all that butter and oil in!!! #propergrub #pregnantlife
2063 2018-06-20 19:31:52 Now that the automotive industry's gone how much revenue's that costing us our State? Alaska dose not have a State Tax because they pay all their needs off of the oil the sell from the State! IN fact people in Alaska get a State Tax Check every year! This includes those who work!
2064 2018-06-20 19:31:50 No because shale oil produces much less distillates than the savings made on less HSFO. So no point for a refiner to change to run more. Also average HSFO contains 2.5% sulphuric. To get that to o.5- needs a blend of 80% light to 20% heavy. That is not going to happen
2065 2018-06-20 19:31:39 Give the man a chance and maybe you’ll end up with free oil changes
2066 2018-06-20 19:31:30 They’re defo hung up on the oil 
2067 2018-06-20 19:31:28 Idk What Possessed Northtown Porsche To Think I Was Bouta Pay $429.56 For A Measly Ass Oil Change 
2068 2018-06-20 19:31:23 The square bit sticking out looks like an ancient sump plug.  Might be an oil tank or casing of an old motorbike gearbox maybe.

2070 2018-06-20 19:31:19 We’ve got a few Central Americans at our Southern, you want to bestow some hospitality and oil money with these people?
2071 2018-06-20 19:31:15 Yeah but if the light comes on before it’s due for another oil change, you can just add more oil and the light goes off
2072 2018-06-20 19:31:06 put olive oil on your skin
2073 2018-06-20 19:31:00 Shea butter and coconut oil keep my skin right... I hate using lotion now
2074 2018-06-20 19:30:52 hey buds, has any of you ever tried using oil on bristol board and if so, how did it go? please let me know. curious!
2075 2018-06-20 19:30:43 Not great news, in my view. It shows real economic stagnation. Much of that inflation number will also be imported via the US$ and crude oil pricing, thus driving transport costs up, with knock on effects into others goods.

2088 2018-06-20 19:29:14 I've heard coconut oil or aloe helps with hair growth
2089 2018-06-20 19:29:11 Tesla is noted for its electric cars but the most significant development may be in energy storage.  This will impact electric energy producers, oil producers and coal producers. Storing renewable energy has been the missing link.
2090 2018-06-20 19:28:55 yes but primary / secondary #energy distinctions are wonkish 
most #humans look at total volunes #coal #oil etc used fo e.g. generate #electricity
2091 2018-06-20 19:28:52 I wish getting your oil changed did something more significant to your car that was noticeable. I feel I just wasted good money on nothing. Even if the air-conditioning work better or the windshield was cleaner I would feel better about spending that money.
2092 2018-06-20 19:28:40 I once tried that on the advice of the doctor but had an accident and tripped over the omega 3 tablets, thankfully I survived with only super fish oil injuries.
2093 2018-06-20 19:28:40 It's amusing as hell to see how the trump fan club always rejects the results of polls that don't fit into their narrative. But, they're quick to site polls if they think said polls support whatever snake oil they're peddling today.
2094 2018-06-20 19:28:25 #WorldCup2018 #Iran #defending there OiL Here against #Spain . Bcz they not going to score #ScorePrediction
2095 2018-06-20 19:28:24 Trump, you blamed Obama when oil/gas prices were high, do you accept responsibility for the current increase in oil/gas prices that are only suppose to raise more this summer?
2096 2018-06-20 19:28:23 This EO will just entice more to come compounding the problem.  Word travels fast
2097 2018-06-20 19:28:11 Me muero si te hacen zafar de ir en cana con tu socio Cristobal Lopez. Devolvé la guita de la gente, la que te llevaste de Oil combustibles
2098 2018-06-20 19:28:08 These days there are 12 year olds winning America’s Got Talent. Meanwhile, I can barley take my car to get an oil change without having an anxiety attack
2099 2018-06-20 19:27:57 Iraqi children were seperated from their limbs thx to WMDs and 45 minutes lie. Mothers watched their children bleed out as we bombed their infrastructure first. Then US and UK contractors ‘rebuilt’, paid with oil. I couldn’t sleep after being part of that design...
2100 2018-06-20 19:27:51 And snake oil sales people.
2101 2018-06-20 19:27:51 Vamos

2103 2018-06-20 19:27:40 Please be careful when rushing to get ready in the morning, I made the mistake of brushing my teeth while putting tea tree oil on my face. Pls don’t be like me
2104 2018-06-20 19:27:29 Oiya yg raspberry cleansing oil itu juga  ku mau share 31k/10mL tunggu nanti yhaaa  sambil nunggu aztec;(
2105 2018-06-20 19:27:18 But oil didn’t flow for years when Jadran 1 occupied the oil crescent. The difference this time is that Jadran 2 fought Haftar. That is illegal under @FrankBakerFCO’s law
2106 2018-06-20 19:27:14 So, that's why they're legalising cannabis oil! Pass the cutchie!
2107 2018-06-20 19:27:14 Blimey Zak, hope you didn’t take a dip in the Irish Sea with that lot, be some oil slick!
#highperformancegrooming
2108 2018-06-20 19:27:12 i mean anything organic like plastics & polymers yeah more often than not your starting feedstock would be some sort of oil distillate. drugs are harder to pin down. like ecstacy starts with sasparilla extract
2109 2018-06-20 19:27:11 I am so mad at my dumb self. Put oven on broil to crisp up olive oil and garlic on my pizza and forgot to change to bake and now my pizza is charcoal 
2110 2018-06-20 19:27:05 Internet : Coconut oil fixes almost everything.

2113 2018-06-20 19:26:34 Speaking of Putin, I’m sure if border checkpoints were being overrun with Russian families wary of socialism fleeing a corrupt government ran by murderous totalitarian dictator Democrat amnesty advocates would totally feel same way they do to.
2114 2018-06-20 19:26:19 Libs hate enforcement of law. Blame the problem on non enforcement then complain when you do enforce it.
2115 2018-06-20 19:26:17 Poor Iran #WorldCupRussia. Goal disallowed Oil price increase
2116 2018-06-20 19:26:06 Don't put oil on your face to start

2120 2018-06-20 19:25:32 it needs oil. lots of oil
2121 2018-06-20 19:25:30 I know someone that NEVER got an oil change. Like NOT ONE. Car died on 95.
2122 2018-06-20 19:25:27 and the drilling words you put too much oil in the case
2123 2018-06-20 19:25:24 Girl I love avocados! I like to cut them up in slices, add salt, pepper, and a little olive oil on top!
2124 2018-06-20 19:25:22 "You know that oreos in Canada are vegan? They're made with coconut oil instead of shortening.

And I don't really love it, but... money."
2125 2018-06-20 19:25:22 Based on my experiences in Factorio, you use the oil to make sulfuric acid or industrial lubricant for batteries and engines.
2126 2018-06-20 19:25:19 If only. But the oil rig might be out of jurisdiction for Senator Wilson's own prolonged extraction of govt funds which would now be in the millions of wasted taxpayer $$$$
2127 2018-06-20 19:25:13 I said olive oil because I've never tried it during a race. Sounds terrible but you never know, right?

2131 2018-06-20 19:24:54 Hey, will you be renouncing big oil and gas contributions this election cycle? Haha rhetorical question Andrew. Relax we already know the answer.
2132 2018-06-20 19:24:51 เป็นไรอ่ะ?
2133 2018-06-20 19:24:47 Scotland could have all the oil in the world & unionists would still say it was worthless!!
Scotland & the Scottish people will never see the full benefit of the huge reserves until independence.
2134 2018-06-20 19:24:41 Keep in mind the thousands of Americans who have been killed or damaged by illegal aliens who never should have been here to begin with.
2135 2018-06-20 19:24:27 Clemson also has an upper deck on both sides, and Death Valley was ranked the #1 college football stadium. It were also ranked #10 best stadium experience in StadiumJourney’s top 100, which includes proffesional stadium (including Dodger Stadium, Lucas Oil Stadium, etc.).
2136 2018-06-20 19:24:12 I like to drown myself in rosehip seed oil
2137 2018-06-20 19:23:49 I would't even trust him to sell genuine snake oil.
2138 2018-06-20 19:23:44 Coconut oil and heavy cream in coffee!!
2139 2018-06-20 19:23:44 & now i’m reading your “sorry....” like the guy in south park says it during the bp oil crisis
2140 2018-06-20 19:23:41 Oh good god for a minute there was free oil for the world.

What scenes cut short #ira #spa
2141 2018-06-20 19:23:19 Usually the light means you’re low on oil, not just that you need an oil change
2142 2018-06-20 19:23:17 So it’s in oil. Is that the main way we get it?
2143 2018-06-20 19:23:03 Thank you , thank you sir. It’s really appreciated. I am up and ready to burn the midnight oil.

2149 2018-06-20 19:22:35 Your MCM's keeper concedes against oil drillers
2150 2018-06-20 19:22:32 Shit, all you got in there is monster energy and a little engine oil
2151 2018-06-20 19:22:30 It doesnt matter what sort of crook provides security for the oil terminals as long as they strike a deal with NOC and oil keeps flowing and foreign oil companies are happy.
2152 2018-06-20 19:22:30 Flash is the crude oil of the internet. Every month another Adobe Valdez runs aground, endangering millions of people. It is an ongoing industrial disaster and it's time we switched to alternative sources of video. Credit - /u/jetRink

To console Those who Mourn in The world, To give Them beauty for ashes, The oil of joy for Mourning, The garment of Praise for The spirit of heaviness; That They May be called Trees of Righteousness, The Planting of the Lord,That he May be glorified...
2154 2018-06-20 19:22:00 How much is our whisky worth, the games industry, Oil is close to $100 dollars and this fool still does everything to say we are worthless. He's the dead weight to Scotland
2155 2018-06-20 19:21:55 New U.S.-Russia-Saudi oil alliance could also have implications for Israel and Iran
2156 2018-06-20 19:21:51 Superman couldn't save anyone in the Wayne Tower, and that oil truck that he dodged and exploded must of caused a lot of harm and casualties
2157 2018-06-20 19:21:46 government back stabbing" honest tax payers by lowering the interest rate on EPF. Considering crude oil prices went to historical low but we still pay high.
Increasing indirect taxes on luxury items
2158 2018-06-20 19:21:37 You’re a puppet for the banking and oil industries.  You don’t give a damn about Canadians.  You and your party are fooling no one.
2159 2018-06-20 19:21:28 I want to frame an oil painting of this tweet
2160 2018-06-20 19:21:24 Because at the time the licenses were sold, onshore oil and gas licensing was reserved to Westminster, so Holyrood would’ve been exceeding its authority. That’s exactly what Ineos argued in court.
2161 2018-06-20 19:21:22 Funny thing, people in Kerala eat all types of meat, drink alcohol ( local made also ) and cocunut based food (also deep fried in its oil) and don't do yoga. Their avg life expectancy is better than that of Gujarat in both rural and Urban.
2162 2018-06-20 19:21:20 A l'année prochaine alors !
2163 2018-06-20 19:21:02 The camembert doesn't have cranberry with it but raspberry coulis. Am saving it to have with yogurt. So the cammies will be served with leftover lemon & herb couscous and potato wedges from work and salad with garlic olive oil & 'salbamic' vinegar on. #MeTea 
2164 2018-06-20 19:21:01 Also, bio oil gets rid of acne scars!! It’s like $8 at Walmart &it works wonders
2165 2018-06-20 19:20:51 [100 km/h drifts into this reply] it extremely depends on the chemical. a lot of it is oil because it is hard to make carbon to carbon bonds industrially and oil has that stuff naturally and theres billions of gallons out there

2170 2018-06-20 19:20:06 Bahahahah...and don’t listen to ppl like the Pope either?? Funny, seems ole Trump is changing his policy today. “Wow, you sure re gullible.” 
2171 2018-06-20 19:19:44 Were you even living in the 2000’s if your parents didn’t have a weird shaped glass bottle with oil and vegetables in it that had no purpose ???
2172 2018-06-20 19:19:17 Funny how this POS lies for a week and tells everyone he can't do a thing and it's the Dems. Oh...suddenly he can change policy with the stroke of pen.  Says he always wanted it. Base again sits silent and allows the snake oil salesmen to spew nothing but lies. FauxNews the same.
2173 2018-06-20 19:19:10 They Won't Give us Free Oil post winning and pls don't expect the fuel prices to go down too? Oil Vs Paella ! @samasmrati
2174 2018-06-20 19:19:00 You’re straw manning. The mentality that landed Lucic was Oil need heavy hockey.
Last year the Oil were in a hurry to do nothing and that landed them where they are. They need to be in a hurry to make the right moves.  
Haste does make waste, no doubt, but Chia is to blame.

2180 2018-06-20 19:18:29 Olive oil
2181 2018-06-20 19:18:18 We have the same issues in Alberta. Decades of failure to plan resulted in a resource economy (oil, wood, cows) & booms followed by busts.  In booms there’s no housing to be found, in busts people can’t afford it.  Work while on EI & SA is punished by benefit claw backs.
2182 2018-06-20 19:18:17 I need a real man I’m tired of playing with lil boys.. I’m tryna explore more like hot oil & sex toys

2190 2018-06-20 19:17:12 And a CEO of a oil company who died before he was going to change the company to cleaner alternatives fuel sources amd then trump oil stock went up buy 50% after he got elected the vehicle had issues with brakes from what the newspaper said at the time..

2195 2018-06-20 19:16:35 Those people are absolutely thrilled with Trump.
.
He & probably you seem oblivious to that.
.
Each time he puts out lies, like the one on Germany , he pours oil on that smoldering fire.
.
The USA has ridded us of the Nazi, at great cost in human life & otherwise.
2196 2018-06-20 19:16:24 Alternatively, don't hide the veg. Enforce the veg. Find your inner Victorian and insist on wholesale veg consumption followed by warm tapioca and cod liver oil.

2232 2018-06-20 19:12:18 Crying at how expensive oil changes are in California. The CHEAPEST I could find was $89.00. . It was only $40 in Georgia
2233 2018-06-20 19:12:16 well you enjoy, looks delicious.
2234 2018-06-20 19:12:15 Not to mention the run on the pound he actually expects that would devalue the pound making the cost of drugs, food, gas, oil & many other things rocket.
2235 2018-06-20 19:12:10 ....poor Italians.....no olive oil, no balsamic vinegar.....no herbs.....no wonder they complain 
2236 2018-06-20 19:11:43 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2237 2018-06-20 19:11:39 Growing madder @Lord_Sugar  for comments on #Senegal team . They are professional players mostly playing in Europe. Does he care to pass judgement in German towel grabbers or Egyptian snake oil sellers? But what really pisses me off is that he tried to defend as funny. WTF 
2238 2018-06-20 19:11:36 Getting oil changed. World Cup on tv. Hot coffee. Yay!

2240 2018-06-20 19:11:16 Great grandfather preferred his reading lantern fueled by whale oil. This 70 year old grandma comes from a long line of people who supported whaling and the decimation of whales throughout the world. Throw her in jail and throw away the key!

2245 2018-06-20 19:10:42 You prefer we spend it on starting wars to get oil like Bush or on purchasing guns that supposedly accidentally ended up in the hand of gangs to kill Americans.  This is real, science is better

2256 2018-06-20 19:09:11 As someone who's helped several seniors get into medical cannabis, I can attest to the need for informed services, and specialized products. There is a steep, scary learning curve to medical usage, and seniors can struggle. Many also can't smoke, vape, or ingest oil suspensions.
2257 2018-06-20 19:09:04 I just want to be rubbed down with oil 
2258 2018-06-20 19:08:48 ive never tried the oil but the gummies, the wax pen, and this lavender cbd pen really helped me  i swear by Cbd it’s amazing.
2259 2018-06-20 19:08:45 Wait until Trump puts oil rigs off the East and West coasts. Odds are we will have a disaster somewhere, with oil flooding the ocean. Does he care? Not one bit. Just stop saying he supports the ocean!
2260 2018-06-20 19:08:42 C'mon dude stop being naive, the weed that you've probably smoked sometime, didn't went there by Fedex. And surely people of Irak didn't needed you neither, and still you invaded their land to steal their oil

2270 2018-06-20 19:07:14 My dude, the left is where the majority of America is, along with the vast majority of the GDP. The right is where you get farmers relying on the Corn lobby to make a living, or subsidizing oil to prevent renewable energy from making it obsolete.
2271 2018-06-20 19:07:06 Idk why I wasn’t coming to landers Mclarty anyways to get my oil changed
2272 2018-06-20 19:07:03 Maggie.  That ship sailed, ran into a container vessel in the harbor, sank with all hands aboard and is leaking oil on the shore killing seabirds.

2277 2018-06-20 19:06:39 Do you have a link to the chart? 

The idea is that we can't produce enough oil to run all pipelines at capacity? So then what justification is there for KXL, other than the need to fulfil agreements with China?
2278 2018-06-20 19:06:38 would olive oil make my hair greasy? i already have really greasy hair naturally so if it does, that may not be the one for me. EW  thats how brad cooks an egg for his ramen, in the water  eggs are creepy

2292 2018-06-20 19:04:53 There is no such thing as sustainable palm oil production because those fields they today claim are sustainable still used to be forests.
2293 2018-06-20 19:04:48 hope we listed those paleo foods. So tired of all the quasi mediterranean diets. Quasi paleo diets. Basically folks cut down your starch, sugar, and exercise more. Butter? I like it & cannot bear life without it! Olive oil? YOU BETCHA.

2301 2018-06-20 19:04:14 The problem isn’t a third runway Dougs, the problem is the lack of funding for faster development electric aircraft. They exist already. They could be carrying millions of people already if govts and oil industry wanted to expedite innovation.
2302 2018-06-20 19:04:04 . transparency from our government.> why than isn't there with trump,why after he was in office for two weeks he took off line the spot ppl can find out how much the oil co were paying the states for drilling permits … why than 1st thing gone?

2304 2018-06-20 19:03:58 Very true! The reason why many developing nations fail to thrive is because the western world have taken all their resources from gold in South Africa and South America to oil in Africa and Russia, whose outback towns fail to thrive and are deserted!

2306 2018-06-20 19:03:57 About seventy (70) new road projects have been inserted into the budget of the Federal Ministry of Power, Works and Housing. In doing so, the National Assembly applied some of the additional funds expected from the upward review of the oil price benchmark to the Ministry’s vote.

2309 2018-06-20 19:03:18 The truth is, the US helps other countries because of quid pro quo. Do you not feel there is benefits to using US sources for energy versus getting involved in wars with middle eastern oil suppliers and governement not yours?

2314 2018-06-20 19:02:52 Hi Craig. About the oil tweet earlier. The Clare field west of Shetland has more oil than the whole North Sea combined. Between 2014 - 18 more fields were discovered than the previous 30 yrs due to more advanced technology. The 70 yrs is a small number of what is actually there

2346 2018-06-20 18:59:18 I think so but aren't those products built on the assumption that volatility is predictable? kinda like how oil futures work? Telecoms are built on debt so that's not really the issue... the issue is the market outlook of most of their countries of operation

2358 2018-06-20 18:57:54 Yeah well, that was same back in the Cardiff Energy ($CRS) days too. NR's said one thing (there was oil in the wells being drilled), then there were issues with the drill bit, then drilling crew quit (NR said they were fired )...then it turns out there's 0 fucking oil! Total bs
2359 2018-06-20 18:57:50 Why the fuck didn’t they discuss oil production?  Oh, because Putin likes it this way.
2360 2018-06-20 18:57:39 They‘re denying climate change, because exxon and Russia have oil in the arktis. The ice needs to melt to get access. Exxon payed at least for one study, that denies climate change. Since it is visible they changed the story to „it’s only natural, happend before“

2371 2018-06-20 18:56:48 Wonder why Tim Cooke hasn’t been brought up on Trumped up charges and convicted in a kangaroo court show trial like Putin’s known to do?
2372 2018-06-20 18:56:47 Trump is jailing children.  You are defending him.  You total facist.  How can you defend this monster.  Herr Farage you are an evil snake oil salesman.

For my toner I just use my rose water since I can’t buy a new one at the moment. & I also started mixing my Bentonite clay mask with just acv and it’s been doing really good!!
2386 2018-06-20 18:54:59 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.

2389 2018-06-20 18:54:43 Google home remedies for ear infection & stop taking the antibiotics. It’s some kind of oil or something that you put in your ear and it does the exact same thing but won’t kill you

2394 2018-06-20 18:53:38 EXCLUSIVE to @ourdailyplanet: Chief Policy Officer of OCEANA @JackieSavitz  says new Trump ocean policy "combined with the President’s quest to drill offshore for oil and gas, shows a complete lack of recognition of the value of healthy oceans to our economy."
2395 2018-06-20 18:53:34 "When you have four or five oil companies, it’s called a monopoly" - Doug Ford #fails
2396 2018-06-20 18:53:32 Arabs in my mentions smh. Go worry about the price of oil or something 
2397 2018-06-20 18:53:07 If we can’t trade, the US gets its continued monopoly on our oil. That’s what this is about: Vivian Krause on the Tar Sands Campaign.
2398 2018-06-20 18:52:54 Putin feels betrayed by Trump since Trump is devastating Russia oil production and killing Russian in Syria then to openly face destroy Russian interest with Iran by backing out of the deal! So Putin instructed me to keep the borders open for invasion!
2399 2018-06-20 18:52:52 kept the heatsink the same as didn't see the point in rewiring, especially since the way the nozzle and throat butt together should (in my mind at least) ensure no real issues that way. 
PID tuned, etc. 

About the only thing I didn't do was oil it, but at that point...
2400 2018-06-20 18:52:48 I was sunbathing with my chebs out today + without thinking put tanning oil on my nipples and now they look like minstrels
2401 2018-06-20 18:52:48 Everything this evil man does goes against the law of nature.Our oceans are full of plastic, oil residue, chemicals, opioids and one could go on and on. He is out to destroy everything that is beautiful & pure.He wants only money.He has lost his youth & now can't bear old age.

2404 2018-06-20 18:52:13 Whole third runway sales pitch a snake oil scam from the usual carpetbagging profiteer city boys who really run this country. It isn’t really needed, it’ll choke thousands and make millions far more miserable.  But, hey, the government’s doing that anyway. #NoThirdRunway
2405 2018-06-20 18:52:08 You know you're at an African-American Christian writers conference when you joke about anointing and three sisters pull oil out of their bags!  #Foundmahpeople #PIC2018
2406 2018-06-20 18:52:02 Why does it take forever to get an oil change?! 
2407 2018-06-20 18:51:54 My student missed class because their car needed an oil change and their pen was out of ink
2408 2018-06-20 18:51:52 Good mass transit keeps fuel usage/demand down.  Undermining it helps big oil.
2409 2018-06-20 18:51:44 @BingingWBabish can you recommend a good oil for frying? The extra virgin olive oil we use is super smokey!
2410 2018-06-20 18:51:43 OPEC and the Iraqi state oil company control oil sales in Iraq. No U.S. company drills and takes oil from Iraq, they pay for exported oil and sell it here. Bush made his huge mistake by going into Iraq in 2003, but that doesn't mean soldiers aren't fighting for us.
2411 2018-06-20 18:51:33 That and dumping money into local races and ballot measures to get people to vote against mass transit, minimum wage, libraries, puppies, etc.  Plus, they probably gain more than the avg billionares since they are so heavy on oil/gas/coal   2/2
2412 2018-06-20 18:51:33 Hahahaha I hate the oil industry

2422 2018-06-20 18:50:22 thanks for taking me down that ugly rabbit hole of a thread.
2423 2018-06-20 18:50:22 Coconut oil, chilling with no makeup on that's when I'm the happiest
2424 2018-06-20 18:50:19 My ancient ancestors used to use liquid gold as tanning oil and honestly that's the vibe I'm going for this summer
2425 2018-06-20 18:50:08 Hopefully Lego's big oil backers will allow this to be made.
2426 2018-06-20 18:50:00 With the legalization of cannabis in Canada maybe we can pressure the government into mass producing hemp and lose our dependency on oil.  Let's step it up Canada.

2428 2018-06-20 18:49:52 If you still refer to oil as “dabs” then you’re probably not educated enough on the subject to be dabbing and probably are dabbing poop soup

2433 2018-06-20 18:49:26 Snush: any veg that works, blended with olive oil, garlic, salt/pepper. We do it with any excess farmers market acquisitions or garden bounties. Adding tahini makes delish. Eat with bread/crackers/spoon.
Ex: roasted eggplant, chickpeas, summer squashes, pumpkin, avo, beans.
2434 2018-06-20 18:49:15 You are forgetting Canada's Strategic Maple Syrup Reserve: 1 Barrel of Oil = $64... 1 Barrel of Syrup = $1400. Imagine what will happen if they get *tough* #OhCanada

2439 2018-06-20 18:48:47 The way the government spoke about it the other day was fucking clueless they couldn’t seem to differentiate the difference between someone smoking a joint or using the oil to stop seizures. And they spend lots of money on other techniques which have a small percentage of working
2440 2018-06-20 18:48:42 Simon still looks like he did from the first episode , oil of Olay?
2441 2018-06-20 18:48:22 She radiates incompetence and disaster like a sponge dipped in olbas oil.
2442 2018-06-20 18:48:19 The Chinese will pay more for oil and the price at the pump will go down for the US consumer as demand for west texas crude drops.  Doesn't sound all that bad to me.
2443 2018-06-20 18:48:19 lol, honestly i dont have breakouts often. but i wash w/ black soap, witch hazel as a toner, & ponds face lotion to moisturize. every now & then i’ll do the aztec clay mask w/ acv. throughout the day i’ll wipe excess oil off w/ witch hazel also w/ a cotton ball
2444 2018-06-20 18:48:18 We shouldn't be accepting middle east refugees. Force those oil rich arab nation and Israel to take them in. We need to take care of our own first.
2445 2018-06-20 18:48:15 Fluff post. At the EPA you force LAYOFFS,  excellent researchers are fleeing, environmental protections being gutted.  Apparently you view the office for your personal oil lobbyists & family use. Resign. Your actions are embarrassing.
2446 2018-06-20 18:48:15 I got my bfs grandmother into hemp seed oil lotion, so I'd say my family dynamic is blossoming
2447 2018-06-20 18:48:07 LMFAO. New technologies ? A Scotsman named Robert Anderson created the first electric car  in the 1830s.  American and Arab oil stiffled  battery developments.
2448 2018-06-20 18:47:59 For shiny hair, mix one egg with a olive oil and apply to your hair. Leave it on for 20-30 minutes then shower.
2449 2018-06-20 18:47:57 Tea tree oil is really good
2450 2018-06-20 18:47:51 I didn’t wanna go outside and tan so early bc it was too hot for me. But I went and got full of oil and since one hour there’s clouds. I’m so mad.
2451 2018-06-20 18:47:37 Which is what? Let’s drill for anything that resembles oil?
2452 2018-06-20 18:47:31 @CoryTV: ‘It’s endlessly frustrating to me that people are unable to distinguish the fact that XRP and Ripple are separate things. I mean, no one calls ExxonMobil ‘oil.’ ExxonMobil has a vested interest in seeing that oil is successful, but that doesn’t mean it’s the same thing.’
2453 2018-06-20 18:47:24 You can do like olive oil and salt. If you wanna do mexi style you can do like and chili powder. Make sure to blot them first.
2454 2018-06-20 18:47:22 Went in there for a simple ass oil change. They start pulling all this shit out saying I need to get this changed and this changed. I’m over here like... I’m pretty sure I didn’t ask y’all niggas for a second opinion lmaoooo
2455 2018-06-20 18:47:18 Fantastic! Just so sad that the back side is being logged so recklessly. Ironic to me, as an Albertan, that BC is so opposed to transporting oil--the product, by the way, that goes into making every mountain bike tire in Fernie, yet allows wilful logging of the Elk Valley. #irony

2460 2018-06-20 18:47:00 @dantheman1013 question? How is Trump making America great again?  Lowers taxes while gas, food, and pharmacy prices rise. Guess that extra money we are making is going to big pharma and big oil companies while they get a huge tax break and increased revenue. Fucking awesome!

2477 2018-06-20 18:45:41 @SeattleOSE does offer rebates for oil -> ductless heat pump (but yes, not to an ASHP). There are WA constitutional constraints against using SCL funds for fuel switching.
2478 2018-06-20 18:45:40 Purpose of that tax cut was helping the uber rich and ballooning the deficit to limit future govt spending. It has achieved that purpose. any other rationalization for it was snake oil selling.

2483 2018-06-20 18:45:27 @AmbDennisRoss Excellency  U never understood Arabs GB's role post Balfour Oil.

2487 2018-06-20 18:45:06 Olive oil, Dijon mustard, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice. Add cumin or sumac if you have. Shake up (to coat - in a ziploc or a bowl) with cauliflower florets, or yellow squash cubes/slices, or butternut, or cooked chickpeas. Spread on cookie sheet, bake at 300 for 45 minutes.

2491 2018-06-20 18:44:52 Radical Islam should be accountable for themselves, but so should European economic policy. Example. BP wanted oil fields in Iran, and Iran's democratic government wanted to socialize the oil fields. Their government was overthrown by UK, US. One Shah removal later...extremists!

2497 2018-06-20 18:44:06 Had to get my oil changed while I'm out of town. There's nothing jiffy about Jiffy Lube. My car has been getting the oil changed for more than 35 minutes!! — feeling crazy
2498 2018-06-20 18:44:05 Aye, Giz Aal Ya Oil And Fuck Off.
2499 2018-06-20 18:44:03 There is science behind it. But to summarize the article, the fries are “soaked in hydrogenated oil (saturated fat) which increases the shelf life and maintains flavor.” Once they cool, “they’re essicially sealed by the hardening saturated fat, which in turn seals off moisture.”
2500 2018-06-20 18:43:55 This has been a slow motion train wreck !! Ugh it’s going to take a lot to get this all turned around !!  Oil and different grades we produce is the best in the world

2504 2018-06-20 18:43:02 Ha, Trump administration and international relations are like oil and water, they don't mix.  In fact, I don't remember any administration that has done more damage when it comes to international affairs than this one.

2508 2018-06-20 18:42:25 Thank goodness for that! I know it was cold last month but.....!!!!!
2509 2018-06-20 18:42:17 does anyone have any experience with cbd oil helping their anxiety? I’m considering trying it
2510 2018-06-20 18:42:15 I just shaved using coconut oil and let me tell you, that’s stuff is LIFE CHANGING
2511 2018-06-20 18:42:09 Wow like an oil painting :) so much colour
2512 2018-06-20 18:41:47 changing a flat , oil changes ect...
2513 2018-06-20 18:41:45 Because they object to child abuse and taking 3 month old babies from their mothers? That’s a hell of a hill to die on
2514 2018-06-20 18:41:43 There's no reason to stay in a church that will expel you for political reasons. I'm so disgusted with them right now.
2515 2018-06-20 18:41:42 If you need someone to oil you down I am a massage therapist lol 
2516 2018-06-20 18:41:09 T’was okay giving me a ride to the mall instead of waiting at your lounge. Next time I would book an appointment. This oil change service is way too long. #nissan
2517 2018-06-20 18:41:08 Well fish oil is excellent I recommend liquid to get the amount needed instead of pills but it is your choice!
2518 2018-06-20 18:41:03 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
2519 2018-06-20 18:41:02 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2520 2018-06-20 18:40:53 Democrats paid for by the oil companies? Do you read or research or just listen to Fox News and the POTUS? Dems have been fighting for alternative energy, EPA regulations to keep our country safe and clean, and keeping banks in check to keep from another collapse.
2521 2018-06-20 18:40:51 LETS HOPE TRUMP RATTLES THE ARABS AND THEIR 30 YEARS OF RIGGED OIL PRICES VIA OPEC CARTEL; UNFAIR BUSINESS...2500 AZIZ FAMILY MEMBERS FLEECING SAUDI ARABIA.... FILTHY RICH THUGS!

2524 2018-06-20 18:40:35 Kfb @Ayshaummy4
2525 2018-06-20 18:40:29 So we can expect that you will support investment in solar and wind power or just more drilling for oil and fracking?

2527 2018-06-20 18:40:22 Or how about you just give me my year worth of free oil changes? 
2528 2018-06-20 18:40:21 Bring patchouli oil. And lots of it.

2532 2018-06-20 18:39:57 Have fun.
2533 2018-06-20 18:39:46 The only thing good about summer, the coconut oil is soft.
2534 2018-06-20 18:39:46 oil
2535 2018-06-20 18:39:44 Great news! That was a massive power grab by 0 after the oil crisis in the Gulf.
2536 2018-06-20 18:39:39 I need to quit playing myself and just buy coconut oil in bulk.
2537 2018-06-20 18:39:35 Andurand was all geared up for a move to $120 when it was at $72, that place is alike a 3x levered oil long etf
2538 2018-06-20 18:39:33 They didnt construct a bloody railway line through the Nairobi National Park for fun.  Oil >Mombasa
2539 2018-06-20 18:39:31 US has welfare but for Wallstreet, Defense Contractors and Coal&Oil 
2540 2018-06-20 18:39:31 Wait what? Defending freedom? What sort of freedom is it for 200000 Iraqi civilians and 40000 US soldiers to be killed in an invasion in a lust for oil? Is that freedom to you? How about Libya? Somalia? No? Afghanistan?
2541 2018-06-20 18:39:26 Into a pan/pot, olive oil, garlic, fresh basil leaves, butternut chunks, tin or two black beans, cumin, salt, pepper, and optional tinned or fresh tomatoes. 
Cook. 
If you like it as stew, keep it as stew. 
If you want bean soup and rice, add a bunch of broth. Eat with rice.
2542 2018-06-20 18:39:01 I literally put baby oil on a cotton ball/pad and it’s so gentle and takes everything off. Then i wash my face normally afterwards.
2543 2018-06-20 18:39:01 Fridays when his kids are gone and the Donald talks the 'truth', a sane person whistles the #starspangledbanner
2544 2018-06-20 18:39:01 I just went 2 hours with no sunscreen on at the beach... I’m gonna regret this.  Ohh yeah and I had tanning oil on
2545 2018-06-20 18:38:58 I just checked my oil and there’s absolutely zero oil in it  and I’ve been driving it
2546 2018-06-20 18:38:47 I didn’t know about the strength bit.  If it’s in h&b then should be ok, they should have done checks etc. 
I’m not sure if the oil itself is illegal as it comes from same plant? 
2547 2018-06-20 18:38:39 unpopular opinion: i hate when i’m getting my oil changed and they show me how much oil i have in my car, i’m like okay i KNOW i was supposed to come here like 2 months ago but i forgot and now there’s like almost no oil in my car
2548 2018-06-20 18:38:34 Like they do with their crude oil.

Great part is, Libya has a lot of options. Too many to mention
2552 2018-06-20 18:37:18 The creation of refugees? $$$$$& MINERALS & OIL !! The culprits NEVER TAKE OWNERSHIP #wars
2553 2018-06-20 18:37:16 Mmm. *Not convinced*. Part of the problem is everything seems to take so long. But overnight transformations are not on the cards, but I feel that all the good of being an "oil city" has been misspent over the years.
2554 2018-06-20 18:37:10 I support the repeal of Barack Obama's arbitrary restrictions on domestic energy exploration.  

I do not support drilling for oil off of South Carolina's coast.
2555 2018-06-20 18:37:09 He has those Oil and Gas sectors.
2556 2018-06-20 18:37:09 Olive oil, bread, tomatoes, garlic, cheese and cured meat... I have found my home 
2557 2018-06-20 18:37:08 Welcome to Chillicothe Rico.
2558 2018-06-20 18:36:49 But you're always reminded the oil one works right
2559 2018-06-20 18:36:43 Oh! Evening primrose oil is supposed to help soften/ripen the cervix.
2560 2018-06-20 18:36:18 Reminder folks, that oil based lube not only breaks down latex condoms but also polyisoprene (Skyns). 

If you use oil, polyurethane (Trojan Supra, Bareskin) or nitrile (FC2) condoms are safe to use.

Otherwise stick to water- or silicone-based lube.
2561 2018-06-20 18:36:12 @sajidjavid @theresa_may 115,000 of us are calling on you to legalise medicinal cannabis oil, promising a review is not enough. Public support is behind us, change this law and save lives! #MedicalCannabisNow

2563 2018-06-20 18:36:04 The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
2564 2018-06-20 18:36:00 Hey @qubadjt, is it possible to do this trade where #TwitterKurds get oil  , government positions and control over armed forces, and you get all the attention you’re seeking off #TwitterKurds? Asking for a friend.
2565 2018-06-20 18:35:39 Even so, you attack Russia and your Forces help terrorists in Syria just to cop Al-Assad and oil.
2566 2018-06-20 18:35:38 I use cbd oil! the dosage varies for ppl but morning and night it helped so much w that keyed up tight feeling. also be aware of muscle tension (cbd helps majorly) and get rid of excess sugar. your body also needs way more water now but u will pee more too
2567 2018-06-20 18:35:37 Or threaten his children

2569 2018-06-20 18:35:19 Important to keep the oil prices in control.
2570 2018-06-20 18:35:18 Just done a load of car things like oil, water, tyre pressure and now I feel like a real man. I even have oil grease on my brow
2571 2018-06-20 18:35:02 Because democrats generally don't care about problems that actually NEED solutions, and republicans generally don't want to infringe on the sovereignty of nations without oil reserves or significant global influence.

Also, because you'll be called racist for worrying.
2572 2018-06-20 18:34:58 I know it's probably cooking basics 101, but @antoni's olive oil thumb control tip is a game changer. Life in the kitchen will never be the same again. Where was this vital knowledge in year 7 catering?
2573 2018-06-20 18:34:57 They're ok,But you should've roast them a little bit more and add oil & seasoning (salt, pepper and chopped chives)
2574 2018-06-20 18:34:47 Been rocking a beard for 25 years now and never used oil, benefits?
2575 2018-06-20 18:34:46 well if you need recommendations I take a woman's multi vitamin (once a day) , Vitamin D3 7,000 (once a day) , Teaspoon fish oil for my vessels and skin and just system in general , and magnesium citrate once right before bed!! but again everyone is different!
2576 2018-06-20 18:34:45 i'm hurt &pizza switched out their garlic sauce with garlic oil.
2577 2018-06-20 18:34:41 My #SummerVibesIn3Words  is Beach, tanning oil, margaritas
2578 2018-06-20 18:34:37 the US has spent trillions carpet bombing and ransacking their countries for oil
2579 2018-06-20 18:34:37 More low-quality links, got it, cloaking them with a layer of oil.

2583 2018-06-20 18:34:21 A lady came in and asked if i had any oils that can help her son with his anxiety bc "i refuse to put him on those drugs-", my virgo ass had to hold myself back before i had to give her facts im sure she knows but doesnt want to hear smh HOW DAFFODIL OIL GONNA HELP
2584 2018-06-20 18:34:13 まりちゃん…………
2585 2018-06-20 18:34:11 And yes, anything is possible if oil goes up, but Permian basin is capacity constrained by getting it out of Texas, and there are 3 or 4 major pipes set to be completed in 2019. Oil will stabilize around $60-70 for the foreseeable future, oil demand globally has stabilized.
2586 2018-06-20 18:34:09 See I can buy anything online but not kube (trad cap), cos I'm like why will I buy a cap for 20k, the same cap if which I buy in the market won't cost me more than 5k and not 4geting the fact that I can get 2 maiduguri grade caps for the same price..my opinion tho.
2587 2018-06-20 18:34:00 334
2588 2018-06-20 18:33:58 Alistair apart from the past couple of years, credit crunch, oil dip Scotland ran surplus for years, in facts Labour gave back £1.5 billion of Scots money to the treasury. Loss leaders like trident and vanity projects etc would save Scotland even more. Many economists know this
2589 2018-06-20 18:33:53 "Big Oil Is Not Prepared For The Electric Car Revolution" GOOD!  It's been a cancer of society working against progress for so many decades, it would be best for society if it were blindsided by a swift and crippling loss of demand.
2590 2018-06-20 18:33:48 Allah sarki. May Allah forgive them all.
2591 2018-06-20 18:33:33 Just say a basic oil change, say no to everything else they ask you if you want done, always use a coupon and you’ll be fine
2592 2018-06-20 18:33:14 #Chief #Justice #Supreme #Court Saqib Nisar took action on unjustified #PetrolPrice
But price got increased rather than reduction despite of significant fall in #crude #oil #price during last 4 weeks.
2593 2018-06-20 18:33:07 Gotta get it out of the oil as soon as it is done.
2594 2018-06-20 18:32:43 Ahhhhhh yes nothing like a good bit off lubricant oil  :D
2595 2018-06-20 18:32:43 I hear the trick to deep frying is to make sure the oil is super hot and the turkey is still frozen...
2596 2018-06-20 18:32:37 It shouldn’t take this long to change the oil in a car
2597 2018-06-20 18:32:26 I reckon he’s tripped over an obscured tree root.

That or someone spilled oil on his route for ‘bants’.

2599 2018-06-20 18:31:55 Managed to drop my car off for an oil change during my lunch break 
2600 2018-06-20 18:31:51 I think it is. If the weed industry is able to counter the gradual decline in the oil industry, it's a good thing. AB, in particular, is one of the leaders in pot industry investment.
2601 2018-06-20 18:31:41 certainly explains why the left wants to disarm the opposition
2602 2018-06-20 18:31:34 there's something called oil cleaning method, don't know if it could help but people on yt said it cleared their skin so you could give it a try maybe?
2603 2018-06-20 18:31:25 And if you are a Jihadist terrorist, simply purchase a kid from the Coyotes or Cartels, bring the kid with you along with your suicide vests, and use the kid as a free ticket into the USA. Jihadists have oil money and will travel Mex desert in style.  Easy way to attack USA.

2609 2018-06-20 18:31:00 Without the Pacers, the Dome likely never gets built. Indianapolis is essentially Louisville - a city defined by a major event, built around college sports, and with a couple of minor league teams. There's no Lucas Oil, no Fieldhouse. Our indoor arena is likely a scaled-down MSA.

2611 2018-06-20 18:30:46 What to make of saturated fat? The source and type matters. Tom Sanders, DSc, @KingsCollegeLon: "You should get your fats from fish and nuts. Coconut oil is just empty calories." #HealthyFats

Are you aware that since last volatility of price, oil price remains without uniformity thru out d country?

2622 2018-06-20 18:30:09 Cheeks are also linked to your respiratory system/lungs. Not sure if you smoke or not, but it can clog pores as well. I'd use sanitary wipes on your cellphone as well. You might just have really active oil producing pores on your cheeks.

2628 2018-06-20 18:29:33 We need to hold ourselves to the same standards as we do the big countries. How can we argue over climate change AND rejoice over oil discoveries? I say keep the oil in the ground.
2629 2018-06-20 18:29:32 In our Nature exists a garden bereft of scripture, where trees double as telephone wires, oil runs in place of rivers, and human life persists as the creaking steps of a wooden staircase upon which the Snakes tread, their legs regrown.
2630 2018-06-20 18:29:30 Does that cover the period in which 2 of our Embassies got bombed? Definitely includes Food for Oil.

2640 2018-06-20 18:28:38 So you don’t really want to scrub dry skin, especially since you have the face cleaning brush you use, best thing would be applying coconut oil (unrefined) to your face and using apple cider vinegar (1 tbs in 1cup of water) to rinse!

2643 2018-06-20 18:28:07 Tags gas oil and parts that isn't enough money for Roads? I rent the land I bought from the government if I don't pay they take it by force you're ok with that?
2644 2018-06-20 18:27:57 And it cheapens what the Nazis did during the holocaust!
2645 2018-06-20 18:27:56 I thought that was olive oil
2646 2018-06-20 18:27:51 Also, make peppermint spray (water and peppermint oil) and spray all door cracks and window cracks!!
2647 2018-06-20 18:27:47 I spritz with tea tree oil before I exfoliate It opens up the pores and helps with acne
2648 2018-06-20 18:27:38 I get it! I do the same on my summer hikes and curse myself for not getting out earlier. Argh. Hey, Mr I Live In A Wicked Hot Climate, if you put peppermint essential oil on the soles of your feet, it really helps keep your body temp down. Enjoy and try to stay cool!

2652 2018-06-20 18:27:31 It's because the areas that have the most bass just happened to be in the oil, Bible or tornado belts. All major Maga troll strongholds.
2653 2018-06-20 18:27:31 Use some olive oil or WD40
2654 2018-06-20 18:27:24 Oil Licence not renewable, No wonder the sudden hate from TY Danjuma, Obasanjo, etc.
Oil Bloc Licences no longer renewable

2655 2018-06-20 18:27:21 It seems ever since that little boy got his confiscated Cannabis oil back for his seizures, there is an opening in government to have a discussion on the failed war on drugs. So a kid needs to fall ill before the grown ups have a discussion. Meanwhile in Canada... 
2656 2018-06-20 18:27:21 Prime as in primer its creams you apply before makeup. Honestly Ive struggled a lot in the past and bought a LOT of wrong products to start with lol makeup is an expensive hobby trust me. & oils like jojoba oil or argon oil are good for dry skin
2657 2018-06-20 18:26:51 I swear I read ‘repissed oil’.
2658 2018-06-20 18:26:50 I lease back a Cessna 182 to the local flying club.  Tuesday I picked it up from the the paint shop, where they also put in brand new carpet. On the flight home the oil pressure gauge on the copilot  side started leaking, dripping oil on the brand new formerly unblemished carpet.
2659 2018-06-20 18:26:15 It's very simple, since you're mixed you inherited black skin genes, which means more natural oil than usual, I still have that problem even at my age but as much.  So every once in a while you'll get acne.
2660 2018-06-20 18:26:09 Yeah, I went in the kitchen and grabbed my bottle to show my son. He thought it was some weird massage oil. I had to explain it was for cooking.
2661 2018-06-20 18:26:03 Cod moratorium was 92. Lots of people here survived before oil. Most of the Province here survive independent of oil. Oil industry doesn’t exist here without everything else in our economy.
2662 2018-06-20 18:26:02 @BrittanyVenti Do you happen to be taking a fish oil concentrate supplement / Omega 3 fatty acid supplement?
2663 2018-06-20 18:25:46 adulting is being excited when your mom offers to pay to have your headlight and oil changed
2664 2018-06-20 18:25:41 An oil change should come with a full tank of gas lmao
2665 2018-06-20 18:25:33 4 racks of beer n 4 grams of oil alone with my girl in the wilderness? Bet 
2666 2018-06-20 18:25:33 Whoever is making that greasy, oil slick hair product for the players at the World Cup, must be making a fortune! 
2667 2018-06-20 18:25:27 Currently watching a live stream on Facebook of PM Khayre giving a speech at an event in Oslo & all he keeps mentioning is Somalia's resources but he's avoiding to mention Soma Oil & Gas for obvious reasons.
2668 2018-06-20 18:25:19 All Balms and Rubs made so stock replenished... infusing another gallon of oil ..sams shopping   laundry  garbage out at the street  critters tended  now to hook away a few hours...
2669 2018-06-20 18:25:17 I've seen a lot of this, our Shugaban qungiya here in Lagos was also a victim of this ,in Ramadan
2670 2018-06-20 18:25:03 So, a super awesome work friend is retiring, and they've always said "I do blood and snot, not oil and grease" in relation to their job, so I'm making a fake "for dummies" book cover, to go over book/card etc saying "oil and grease for dummies"....
2671 2018-06-20 18:24:41 I want to go home and do a hot oil treatment
2672 2018-06-20 18:24:38 Times like these make me understand the whole “sisterwives” strategy. I’m need to pour coconut oil all over this day then eat a black bean burger and sweet potato fries with some vino. 
2673 2018-06-20 18:24:25 HARPER took 250 million of Oil revenues changing SK - Federal deal
2674 2018-06-20 18:24:16 I know, right?I love #CANADIANS.
they are so chill, already. But maybe that's why they're so chill.We have cannabinoid receptors in the brain that need to be filled. I just want a salad
& maybe a little oil. A little green CURE in everyone's backyard
2675 2018-06-20 18:24:16 It seems like the @LiberalQuebec are living on an other planet when they say no to the gas industry in Quebec and "Yes please" to the oil and gas money from the other provinces.
2676 2018-06-20 18:23:57 InfoChip's rugged #RFID tag carriers can withstand extreme temperatures, exposure to #oil, chemicals, water, dust & other contaminants.
2677 2018-06-20 18:23:49 Heartbreak for @MattyMerrison_ as his team Morocco became the first team to be knocked out the world cup and his dreams of sweepstake went up in smoke. @tomyatesss's Russia are though to the knockouts, and he's as happy as Putin with barrel of oil.
2678 2018-06-20 18:23:47 the only way i ever ingest it is with tinctures, so i have no recommendations. just make sure the CBD oil is cannabis derived.
2679 2018-06-20 18:23:44 Not joking at all.  Was thinking the exact same thing.
2680 2018-06-20 18:23:42 I mean, why hasn’t Kathy Griffin been disappeared yet? If Trump were really Putin, Acosta would’ve already been shot dead in the street by now.
2681 2018-06-20 18:23:34 The cloud will be on an oil rig?
2682 2018-06-20 18:23:23 Fonda is sick.
2683 2018-06-20 18:23:18 Red oil.
2684 2018-06-20 18:23:02 Water. Drink water. A lot of water. A whole lot of water. And early morning before breakfast a spoon of olive oil.
2685 2018-06-20 18:22:53 And I also worked in the KSA for an agency that couldn’t be spoken about in parliament because of what we were doing. Wake up and realise KSA destabilise the entire region to keep there oil flowing at a high price
2686 2018-06-20 18:22:51 demagogues, snake oil salesmen, religious quacks etc. And the internet.
2687 2018-06-20 18:22:51 I do my own oil changes for mine
2688 2018-06-20 18:22:40 who's the person on here who said they never got an oil change in 6 years?
2689 2018-06-20 18:22:26 Zinke is as corrupt as they come he has sold out ALL wildlife endangered or not to hunters he has sold out the American people allowing oil companies to drill in your National Parks & is going to allow drilling in your pristine Arctic Refuge.

2697 2018-06-20 18:20:49 $50.5 par barrel of crude oil ? That is huge.
2698 2018-06-20 18:20:36 Prime..? What's that?  Sorry, I'm so dumb with all this. 
Oh yes, I'm currently using one with aloe vera and it's amazingggg. Oil, um, which one? 
2699 2018-06-20 18:20:33 The dipstick doesn't reach the oil with this one.
2700 2018-06-20 18:20:28 If baby oil can do that I’m buying some stock in it!
2701 2018-06-20 18:20:08 @dannywood Getting my car’s first oil change... :)
2702 2018-06-20 18:20:00 The cod moratorium started just before Hibernia came online in nov 97. This province would be a ghost town without oil.
2703 2018-06-20 18:19:58 No one is moving there, guess your writer just wanted an out the way holiday. I wlll review Georgetown Guyana for you, people are moving there cause of the oil.

2705 2018-06-20 18:19:50 Brought my car into the mechanics to do the oil and transmission and I'm bracing myself for the call that something unexpected is wrong with my car which will cost me a million extra dollars.
2706 2018-06-20 18:19:40 Go work the oil fields man. 80k starting, just gotta pass a drug test.
2707 2018-06-20 18:19:38 I dey,oo bro hw hustle
2708 2018-06-20 18:19:35 Speaking as a owner of the 2017 version with  less than 15,000 miles , and already on its 3rd recall- none of which is that it uses oil always 1 quart low at oil change time .
 Remember when the Jeeps did`nt fall apart going over a  crack in the street ... no really I`m waiting.
2709 2018-06-20 18:19:26 Actually no, oil goes to Autozone for recycling and coolant goes to hazardous waste collection up the road. I served 12 years navy doing security and my whole family worked in law enforcement so yea...
2710 2018-06-20 18:19:23 uhmm...you do realize "port usage" and the oil refinery are two completely separate things?
2711 2018-06-20 18:19:16 In the oil field now. I got jammed up at the jail but I’m good bro
2712 2018-06-20 18:19:15 I find those scents at my local Walmart. But I am specifically looking for the primrose, mango, Argan oil, and blueberry scents! I’ve looked everywhere

2717 2018-06-20 18:18:39 You know how an oil tanker takes miles to slow down? The real affects of #Brexit will only become apparent several years after the fact. And if it's bad, what will the response be? How much planning has our government done? Precious little beyond the next GE I'll warrant. All the
2718 2018-06-20 18:18:29 Did they water the field with vegetable oil for this Spain  - Iran  match? Why can't anyone who touches the ball stay on their feet?! #wc2018 #russia2018 #worldcup2018
2719 2018-06-20 18:18:26 I might add fish or cottage cheese and a slice of wholegrain sourdough with olive oil. And nuts (I had them for a snack later)
2720 2018-06-20 18:18:25 "I know, so do I" He said as he scoops Loki up and carries him to his bed and sets him down, grabbing the lavender oil and cotton wool balls, gently dabbing Loki's face with it.

"This should help it heal.. I'll do this three times a day for you"
2721 2018-06-20 18:17:58 That’s exactly what he’ll do. Then, he’ll make a big show of signing an executive order to stop his own policy. It’s not that complicated. His base will fall at his feet, once again succumbing to the narcotic voice of this snake oil salesman.
2722 2018-06-20 18:17:57 Wintergreen oil spearmint oil applied to your temples Bridge of your nose forehead behind your ears and back of your neck will help relieve the most severe
2723 2018-06-20 18:17:55 Arabs cant do anything well except enjoying oil money
2724 2018-06-20 18:17:55 Water or oil. But in moderation.
2725 2018-06-20 18:17:38 Longer, but before that it was apocalypse by Peak Oil, where we were about to run out of oil, when we do, civilization is going to collapse and everyone is going to die.
Before that is was something about Four Horsemen.
2726 2018-06-20 18:17:36 Oil change for the dub in Tallahassee area 
2727 2018-06-20 18:17:25 I’ve never heard of coconut oil! Might give it a try!
2728 2018-06-20 18:17:23 True of anywhere in the world who do not have Nukes but have Gold, Oil & other resources.
2729 2018-06-20 18:17:14 Sammie didn't get an oil change for 20,000 MILES & cost my mom $400 the other day bc her pos shit car is so fucked up. I ain't tryna get anything paid for, let alone my $65 oil change but like ok. Take care of your things without mommy's help dumb bitch

2733 2018-06-20 18:16:45 As others said, much cheaper to make your own and very simple to flavor to your taste. My regular is black coffee 1 TSP MCT oil and 1/2 TBS and blend .
2734 2018-06-20 18:16:40 Surprised there is not more of uproar among people and groups in NL over moves by Federal Government to overhaul environmental assessment process re oil and gas. Too late when it’s passed. NL can’t afford this @NoiaNL @YourOilandGas @Business_NFLD @globeandmail @MunicipalNL
2735 2018-06-20 18:16:29 2 things today...

1) Colorado Springs is boring as all hell. 

2) I just had (legally) a Hummus made from marijuana infused olive oil.  It was absolutely delicious.  

3). Cancel all future plans today.  My day is now shot and so am I.  I need a comfy chair and a show to watch!
2736 2018-06-20 18:16:28 Things I'm picturing being requested... "help me build my Ikea bookshelf" or "change the brakes and/or oil in my car" because those are things I can do
2737 2018-06-20 18:16:28 Just washed my hair. I feel like a new enby. Got the shea butter and Jamaican black castor oil going. When it dries and I iron it out, it's going to be lustrous. LUSTROUS.
2738 2018-06-20 18:16:28 If they're gonna have cash to roll out new programs and initiatives a few weeks before election, they're gonna have to kiss some Big Oil behind.
2739 2018-06-20 18:16:26 Gonna oil up your airsofts and dildos, Sunshine?
2740 2018-06-20 18:16:21 Who has the responsibility to ensure with have a sound oil sector that will not be dependent on subsidy? @NGRSenate & Reps. @benmurraybruce is part of them. Ask him why #PIB can't pass for decades.
2741 2018-06-20 18:16:07 Is there an oil pipeline that could go through the camps? I think that would be the only reason Justin Trudeau would consider your request.
2742 2018-06-20 18:16:03 Sick lunatic. Needs padded cell on a remote oil platform.
2743 2018-06-20 18:16:00 .@ICMM_com’s Luke Balleny says that secret #oil, #gas, and #mining deals are inherently bad but @ICMM_com does not require #ContractDisclosure - “it is not on us.” #NoSecretDeals(?) w/ @OxfamAmerica @PWYPUSA
2744 2018-06-20 18:15:58 Nymex wti crude oil buy call. ....now change sl. ... $62 to $63.90   and wait for my. ....targets. ....
2745 2018-06-20 18:15:49 No? What'd people do before Hibernia? The entire NL economy is oil based? You need to educate yourself.
2746 2018-06-20 18:15:48 Lol
2747 2018-06-20 18:15:44 Had Spaatz/Harris got their way on the “Oil Plan”, would it have ended the war early or did the Transport Plan help ensure the success of D-Day (and therefore would have failed without it).
2748 2018-06-20 18:15:36 Check your Engine oil today.
2749 2018-06-20 18:15:33 except the problem is with millions of people wanting white sage natural order is upset. The same with coconut oil or crystals. When its a gigantic industry then it becomes out of balance. That is the original tweet I responded from a native american man.
2750 2018-06-20 18:15:20 Tellurian knowledge Land If oil as self-flagellation that they will always been reading of itself, 'eternally flooding back'
2751 2018-06-20 18:15:18 So why do you want to pollute it and cover it with oil rigs?
2752 2018-06-20 18:14:42 Just a warning do not sunbathe covered in carrot oil doesn’t work and you will have mild sunstroke Xxxx
2753 2018-06-20 18:14:27 Then Jagr is about a year out from being oil if that’s the case
2754 2018-06-20 18:14:19 rub me down with that lotion, baby oil me, I'm always throwing on clothes, she always throwing a fit
2755 2018-06-20 18:14:16 A tibise motho ka fish oil ya go bela maan 
2756 2018-06-20 18:14:14 Side point, but this is one of the reasons why “The Transportation Plan” was so controversial as it diverted attention from destruction of The Industry/Oil (which the allies later learnt was highly effective). One of the great “what ifs” is what would have happened...
2757 2018-06-20 18:14:09 Got 2b is so expensive. I just copped ecostyler argan oil and the curl and wave gel, i hope it works for me
2758 2018-06-20 18:14:07 That's fair. But I think the article does itself (and readers) a disservice by implying that taxpayers are footing the bill. I doubt your average oil co is any happier than avg taxpayer at having to pay for an NEB employee screw up.
2759 2018-06-20 18:14:06 Girl....where do I begin?? Lol!! I’m getting ready to finally post on IG, but right now, @Oneloveorganics Vitamin C body serum, @ELUCXTM a Canadian brand Zen Body Oil is my fave. @lepaar24kskin from Australia is another amazing one. @LunaOils is another one. Just you wait 
2760 2018-06-20 18:14:04 They’re likely to fall off quick if the product your using to wipe your makeup off has oil in it, and if the eyeshadow your using has oil in it too
2761 2018-06-20 18:14:00 @realDonaldTrump Stand firm against MSM and Dem mob.  Do not cave to their
media generated hysteria.  BIG OIL AND YOUR MIDEAST policies are getting my TAX CUTS.
2762 2018-06-20 18:13:58 I need to put oil down on a pan to cook bacon without it sticking, you have a bad pan.

Bacon produces so much grease, that should be all you need
2763 2018-06-20 18:13:42 Diamonds are formed under pressure, olives are pressed to release oil, seeds grow in the dark, every time you feel under pressure or pressed, you are in a powerful place of transformation
2764 2018-06-20 18:13:41 There wouldn't be too many projects to be managed in this province if the oil industry never existed
2765 2018-06-20 18:13:41 Well, the left have also called Trump "Hitler" while in the same breath, called on him for insane gun control regulation.

OIL！
2767 2018-06-20 18:13:33 Totally agree. Ive baked it in cookies in the past and the relief is worth it. Tried CBD oil recently but the cost is high and you have to take it every day to be effective. I'd rather have a cookie as it works right away when I need it on my really bad days
2768 2018-06-20 18:13:31 The oil that will prosper you, is the oil that is directed.  You don't invest your talent in all people. 
Many of the things people suffer is misdirected gifts.

2769 2018-06-20 18:13:27 Big thanks to all the @Google employees that came to our program on Sunday to lead and sponsor STEAM projects! The children learned about chemical reactions between oil and water, and baking soda and vinegar. Check out some of the photos from these two awesome projects.
2770 2018-06-20 18:13:22 Tiffany is a  education administrator that likes Chili oil on their ground beef pizza with gin
2771 2018-06-20 18:13:22 One does wonder what reassurances on oil production volumes it took for Saudi to roll over for Putin..
2772 2018-06-20 18:13:15 Only GOING TO TURN THINGS AROUND. We're GOING TO END. You KNOW, SORT OF STRANGE ENDORSEMENT. I WANT TO KEEP THE OIL. But WE NEED STRENGTH IN OUR COUNTRY. It's SO IMPORTANT.
2773 2018-06-20 18:13:14 The hell we won't you snake oil selling charlatan. Call yourself a pastor? Horse crap! If you were a decent man you'd tell donnie he's going to hell.
2774 2018-06-20 18:13:12 I would. You're Eddie sounds like a stickler for detail.
2775 2018-06-20 18:13:09 I need to hurry tf up and get outta bed so I can get an oil change before work

2778 2018-06-20 18:12:40 We got here, cos we all saw oil money as free money and our politicians made us biliv dey were doing us a favour by d little dey share with us, they ensured that d basics in our society does not work while ensuring that money bcame our only measure of success
2779 2018-06-20 18:12:38 Asked my bother if he had an extra dipstick because mine doesn’t reach the oil anymore. He said to use a wire hanger. 
2780 2018-06-20 18:12:27 Maybe Stirling is asking for more than he is worth, the other two I’m not sure about but it could be FFP issues or the low oil prices?
2781 2018-06-20 18:12:25 Hate getting my oil changed

2784 2018-06-20 18:12:14 I think the good news is: after #transmountainpipeline, KeystoneXL, Enbridge Line 3 and 67, the Canadian oil sector will be good for many years; if only now, we can build some LNG takeaway to Asia. Might not seem like it to the naked eye but good times are ahead for Canada oil.
2785 2018-06-20 18:11:57 @maej43 What body oil are you into right now?
2786 2018-06-20 18:11:34 Hahahahhahahahahahahahababahahzbzbbabsbzbsbshahahahahahaha. Took you this long to find out the republicans are all corrupt. Bush's two wars, patriot act, taking loads of money from big oil and pharm. Where you in a coma for the last 30 years?
2787 2018-06-20 18:11:31 There are 2 types. CBD oil has little or no THC, does not get you high and is 100% legal. Cannabis oil has CBD + THC, gets you high and is therefor currently illegal
2788 2018-06-20 18:11:24 Work refurbishment=volatile chemicals and inevitable headaches. Attempt to alter neuronal response by sniffing lemon oil has failed #head

2794 2018-06-20 18:10:40 tamanu oil mirip oli bekas campur air :(
2795 2018-06-20 18:10:39 You sound like you don't know a thing about the fuel industry in this country. Ask people like @benmurraybruce why it has taken the senate so long and endlessly to deregulate the oil sector?
2796 2018-06-20 18:10:35 They had CHOICES...With OIL??
2797 2018-06-20 18:10:33 It is a sad story. A nation with vast oil resources that can create secondary industries to employ her people but wallowing in poverty. Our love for money is too much & that is where the problem begin!!!
2798 2018-06-20 18:10:31 they put oil on his arm
2799 2018-06-20 18:10:30 Depends on what you are using it for! - cooking, raw, salad dressing, frying, essential oil, body rub ;)
2800 2018-06-20 18:10:23 About somes it up , high oil production and hyper inflation, Ppl on the ground haven’t seen any benefits from it . They can’t do much about anything so occupy their time and block out the crap happening around them . Very sad .

Does anyone have any sure fire way of getting rid of cooking oil and/or the smell of it?

2809 2018-06-20 18:09:47 last night was the BIGGEST fucking catastophe. I got motor oil in my hair & RUINED my clothes. 
2810 2018-06-20 18:09:45 Nymex wti crude oil buy call pft $65.15 to till now $66.10 pft. ... $00.95 point. ... mean pft. ...950 U.S Dollars. ...
2811 2018-06-20 18:09:31 You raise an interesting point. Not expanding our scope. RD's we dialogued with at PEN booth (DC conference) r being asked about trying it with patients 4 medical use - often given as an oil in "edibles". RD work with pharmacists just like we do with drug nutrient interactions.
2812 2018-06-20 18:09:25 My fav is the one from lush! It's a powder so it absorbs the oil and it's magical

2815 2018-06-20 18:08:40 Am I right in thinking that medical cannabis oil doesn’t get you high? If that’s the case what’s the problem with legalising it ?
2816 2018-06-20 18:08:38 I spend my day writing up oil changes & sending @DConrad77 memes all day. Life’s good.
2817 2018-06-20 18:08:22 I'm guessing oil. Tho oil won't do much if your skin isn't already smooth
2818 2018-06-20 18:08:21 Hope they keep the Oil Riggers. 
2819 2018-06-20 18:08:19 You mean your fake climate crisis bullshit tax . Me thinks you might be just simple enough to believe money will replace Oil . If so retire !

2822 2018-06-20 18:07:54 it slept in the oil
2823 2018-06-20 18:07:50 Yes. You can just wait a minute or two after applying the moisturizer. The oil was only going to absorb so deep anyway.
2824 2018-06-20 18:07:44 My hair actually looks like an oil spill 
2825 2018-06-20 18:07:24 Do you deliver? I know you do crunchie by post, but do you do mains? That sounds bloody awesome!

2831 2018-06-20 18:07:09 My husband was out of work for two years. Just went back. It is not the NDP’s fault that PC’s allowed unfettered development and a massive oil bubble to happen. Nor is it her fault they failed to diversify the economy. It is her fault we have made significant moves to fix that.
2832 2018-06-20 18:07:08 Um did she leave space for the oil to drip or just let it sit in the oil
2833 2018-06-20 18:07:05 i knew you would say that !

Just make the batter and pour into a gallon ziplock bag, snip a corner off and squeeze a design into heated oil  Hope that works if the mix is safe for you! We use oil instead of butter & water instead of milk in the mix recipe
2845 2018-06-20 18:05:18 Not to be dramatic, but I would rather die than go for an oil change alone.
2846 2018-06-20 18:05:15 took my car for an oil change and surprise surprise it needs some work. ..... looks like im walking from here on out fellas 
2847 2018-06-20 18:05:14 that sounds an awful lot without doing the maths. that is @eddietemple1471 thing.

2849 2018-06-20 18:05:06 Someone needs to lay off the Adderall.... Try cannabis, or CBD oil.
2850 2018-06-20 18:05:04 The more I ride my little 250, the more I'm convinced it'll go the distance. Just need to figure out where the oil leak is...
2851 2018-06-20 18:04:57 I’m all about cannabis, cannabis oil.......but not there

2853 2018-06-20 18:04:35 The oil market been crazy today.  2st big spike going into EIA, then a selloff on product builds, then bid up, then down again after KAF made his comments at the OPEC+ meeting.  After all this, Brent still negative and WTI up 80 cents.  Got it? Good!

2856 2018-06-20 18:03:53 If you ever want to feel bad about yourself, drop a piece of fried onion from your lunch on a piece of white paper and watch as the oil blot around it grows bigger.
2857 2018-06-20 18:03:53 Bro I brought my car for an oil change and I’m hearing these noises like shit break it and get me a new one  jk
2858 2018-06-20 18:03:51 I can’t stop howling. The first thing my cousins taught me is to toss garlic, onions, and oil in the bottom of the pot. I don’t give a damn if you’re making cereal. Just put some garlic, onions, and oil on the stove every time you walk into the kitchen for good measure.
2859 2018-06-20 18:03:50 Would you be happy if Oilers drafted Kravtsov over Bouchard, Smith or Boqvist? 

Personally I would be impressed if Oil Scouts actually scouting him hard and take him!
2860 2018-06-20 18:03:42 You can buy a 100 safety razors from between £6 to £13 depending on the brand. Better shave, more environmentally friendly and way cheaper! This multiple blade nonsense is just marketing snake oil.

2862 2018-06-20 18:03:37 I still don't get why Dangote is siting  his Refinery at jam-packed Lagos when Akwa Ibom and Rivers has larger deposits of oil. We don't even have the needed infrastructure for the transportation. Ive been saying this that most of them in power lack common sense
2863 2018-06-20 18:03:36 must be getting nearer now...can't sit still for ten minutes so this is hard work waiting.
2864 2018-06-20 18:03:27 If you have acid reflux, Colitis, IBS, or anything related I highly recommend mixing water with peppermint oil. I have been drinking this throughout the day & have never felt relief like this before. It also helps with appetite control
2865 2018-06-20 18:03:27 This is a bit misleading... the oil patch isn't near its limit, takeaway capacity is.  Big difference.

2867 2018-06-20 18:03:02 Oh!

Thought we were talking about hair. 

Ok for skin, you always want to apply products according to molecular size, so thinnest to thickest. Your moisturizer won't absorb through an oil.

Definitely try it!
2868 2018-06-20 18:02:57 Pro store tissue oil and tea treat oil from The Body Shop 
2869 2018-06-20 18:02:55 you got that right.
2870 2018-06-20 18:02:54 There is purely no development there. That is a 3 day toilet supply. Have a more broader vision and do Chero ma feeding scheme e.g supply Chibage  ,rice ,bulgar sugar cooking oil monthly supply per house hold kune vanoshaya Kwete izvo.
2871 2018-06-20 18:02:47 I can put his oil on him
2872 2018-06-20 18:02:39 Agreed (in spirit if not letter of law) as NEB is funded by Parliamentary appropriations, but 97% subsequently recovered from companies and returned to Receiver General. Though I'm not sure oil companies paying govt agency to hire private investigators is better optics
2873 2018-06-20 18:02:37 I use the @OleHenriksen oil control toner all the time but today I used it and my pimple is literally shrinking by the minute, I can’t stop saying enough good things about this brand

2883 2018-06-20 18:01:27 Maybe you can focus on other markets for tesla, countries that are not so dependent on oil. Bruce Lee became famous when he returned to China, while he was in the USA the producers did not give importance to him
2884 2018-06-20 18:01:12 He actually bought so much oil from Saudi he almost put our businesses out of business.

2894 2018-06-20 18:00:17 So Contrary to popular belief, you can use oil (some oils not all ) on Oily skin . 
Oils high in linoleic acid are best for you , they are lightweight and don’t sit on top of your skin they absorb well are known not to clog pores (non comedogenic)
2895 2018-06-20 18:00:17 “Hiya where’s your baby oil” asks whilst holding a big bottle of prosecco
2896 2018-06-20 17:59:56 I did  after replying to you I had some chamomile and I slept for about 2 hours. 

This is for skin. My very oily skin is feeling dry and I was thinking of adding a moisturizer before the oil (jojoba and Rosehip)
2897 2018-06-20 17:59:54 We can trade Iran some bookworms that only eat their " holy scriptures " for all the hijabs , burqas and weird hats and robes in the country . These burn almost as well as oil .
2898 2018-06-20 17:59:45 No Mike I fully understand the difference. Her company sells CBD oil - it's not the same oil as she's campaging for her son -  the BBC is trying conflate the two.
2899 2018-06-20 17:59:44 .....or the lengths your father will go to intentionally cause crisis for news diversion, promote divisiveness, lie, obfuscate, create spin, use smoke screens, sell snake oil, and charm snakes.

2908 2018-06-20 17:58:02 Olive oil thank you for these totally ridiculous, racist and fake points. Have fun in wonderland
2909 2018-06-20 17:58:02 I shouldn't answer any of your qurations because I don't know if you took a nap today.

Yes, once the water based moisturizer is absorbed into thw hair, the oil is effective in sealing the moisture in for a day or two.
2910 2018-06-20 17:58:02 In this scenario it's about justice. Old testament law is pretty strong on it.
"Punishment" is probably the wrong word; "sacrifice" or even "offering" might be a better word. Sometimes it was grain or oil that were sacrificed.

2929 2018-06-20 17:55:52 Because Iraq and Libya were easy 'wins' military wise, and oil/central Banking reasons were also rather prevailant. No western country in their right mind would attack mighty Russia and North Korea don't have anything we want.

2936 2018-06-20 17:55:18 There was also onshore fracking in Cornwall from 1977 until 1994. I think the dangers are being exaggerated based on American data. We have higher standards than America. Oil & gas are unsustainable & alternatives need to be found.

2977 2018-06-20 17:49:47 Completely agree with you there. On the other hand, we as a nation constantly go into other countries to "help the civilians", yet we do nothing for central americans?
Is it because their country doesn't have resources such as oil, which we can rape from them?
2978 2018-06-20 17:49:36 Damn. The 'free' market, expensive as it is, works better when you don't have people asking questions. This is good news for the sale of snake oil.
2979 2018-06-20 17:49:29 @prattprattpratt As a Vietnam-era vet, I ask you to stop feeding into the myth that our volunteer military protects anything but oil companies. Every day, our country is under direct attack by shootings and jailing children. Our military does NOTHING - but steal social security.

3000 2018-06-20 17:47:22 It isn't even the oil prices that are in question. The price for a barrel of oil is relatively cheap. It is the refined fuel that seems to have an artificial price point divorced from supply.
3001 2018-06-20 17:47:08 "What kind of oil did you want to go with today?"
"5w 30"
"Yep but what kin-"
"Don't try to sell me anything I just need 5w 30"
"Ma'am I understand but I need to know-"
"You people always try to sell me things I'm not dumb okay"

The latest escalation in the tariff exchange, however, is a little bit different than all the others so far. It’s different because it came after Beijing said it intends to slap tariffs on U.S. oil, gas, and coal imports.

3058 2018-06-20 17:41:16 I went to get my oil changed on my car and the guy was like “how many miles to you have” i said “6100” he said “wtf you barely have any miles why do you need an oil change” boy idk cause my car said so 
3059 2018-06-20 17:41:13 Quite looking forward to burning my son's work clobber when he finishes...50° wash, pre wash and heavy soil program never gets all the chip oil out. Should go up quite well :)
3060 2018-06-20 17:41:09 YES and the absolute worst kind of peanut butter is the one where you open it and there's fucking two gallons of gross-ass peanut oil at the top
3061 2018-06-20 17:41:08 I hope this JustJOY oil do some justice to my hair
3062 2018-06-20 17:41:06 Nigeria politicians are really frustrating the citizens of our country Nigeria, our president said Nigeria youth are lazy what happened to his own son that is eating oil money freely without working for it, he flu first class to abroad with the same money freely without working.
3063 2018-06-20 17:40:55 The OP said "gas" and "West Virginia." Slip of the brain to type "oil" in the reply, and there's nothing about Canada, but the issue remains fossil fuel infrastructure being dangerous and dated.

3065 2018-06-20 17:40:50 Virgin coconut oil production
3066 2018-06-20 17:40:47 She sells the oil that's legal in the UK not the one she brought in from Canada and the profits go towards caring for Billy. Unlike others in this situation she isn't crowd funding but she is a full time carer to a very sick little boy.
3067 2018-06-20 17:40:41 And anti-vaccination peeps that I encounter seem to demand Cannabis oil and other odd things with no safety profiles or SPC or RCTs! 
Bizarre but that’s life!
3068 2018-06-20 17:40:34 It's in the news and politics at the moment because a woman had cannabis oil confiscated that she used to stop her sons epileptic fits. And she'd travelled to America just to get it.
3069 2018-06-20 17:40:31 Dentist tomorrow... then food and gym clothes shopping on Friday... ohhhh vaping oil buying too.
3070 2018-06-20 17:40:29 おにーさんにまかせとけー！

3076 2018-06-20 17:39:45 @dpradhanbjp sir would like to meet you n discuss about the ongoing concerns in oil n gas contract norms n criteria issues
3077 2018-06-20 17:39:43 The thing that tickles me the most is that people are almost as concerned about my grammar as they are my political views about cocaine and oil!
3078 2018-06-20 17:39:40 Maybe if you rub some sham oil on your vagina you’d feel a little better
3079 2018-06-20 17:39:35 Don't undermine it, don't underestimate it. Your oil can still take you places. It can still place you before Kings.

3081 2018-06-20 17:39:27 even I, through whom on your homeward path strip, and anoint thy body therewith as with oil;
3082 2018-06-20 17:39:15 Yeah I guess so. I thought I wasn’t using it right or applying less. But guess it isn’t working for me.

I have a very dry skin. I need to apply something at night before going to bed. I was using bio oil earlier but decided to try this. But yeah.
3083 2018-06-20 17:39:13 Pour some motor oil on her back RT @MojoGreen1217: Wish I had more hands to give Nicki twerk 4 thumbs down 
3084 2018-06-20 17:39:11 Would you like to stop using our products then?
3085 2018-06-20 17:39:05 I'm dead against #Fracking & not keen on a 'Ban' because it can and will be challenged in the Courts or overturned by @DavidMundellDCT or who gets the job if #Labour get in. I did 38 years Off-shore, wells are fully lined & don't get 'Fracked'. We either want Oil or we don't.
3086 2018-06-20 17:39:02 #Pisces & #Aquarius are like oil & water but you two could make money together.
3087 2018-06-20 17:38:55 Right throughout the sanction years we paid premium dollar for our oil and weapons. SA busted sanctions for almost 20 years by early 90's but it caught up with us. The agreement was that the ANC will take over the debt in exchange for ... I don't know what.
3088 2018-06-20 17:38:54 Israel is a military anchor in the near east, projecting US power claims for the basis of the dollar, oil.
(pressures Syria, Iran, Iraq etc.)

And a land route for pipelines if not under US control, would heavily endanger US dominance on the global oil market.
3089 2018-06-20 17:38:40 Speaking of things that happened a long time ago, that #NoDAPL hashtag in your bio seems a bit dated now that the pipleline has been transferring over 500,000 barrels of crude oil per day for the past year and has remarkably been entirely free from significant incidents. Hooray!
3090 2018-06-20 17:38:36 Yes. I oil cleanse twice a day. And don’t use any chemical exfoliants on the day you plan to use adapalene.
3091 2018-06-20 17:38:35 $80 bro: shampooed, deep conditioning, hot oil treatment, trim, blow dry, annnnnd hair included
3092 2018-06-20 17:38:18 Break it up, like Standard Oil was divided into seven companies.
3093 2018-06-20 17:37:56 Lube Oil Engineer @ a Nuclear Power Plant - "Our cooling tower gear reducers were virtually inaccessible, which made oil replacement very difficult. Using the Glanon Filter-Cart, the gear oil is now reclaimed right in & out of the gear boxes in a regular PM program."
3094 2018-06-20 17:37:54 I’m guessing I shouldn’t  the salicylic acid anymore then? And maybe go back to oil cleansing twice a day because won’t it dry my skin out?

3096 2018-06-20 17:37:46 True, which shows how ignorant they are of modern research & safety standards.
3097 2018-06-20 17:37:42 
3098 2018-06-20 17:37:37 white vinegar & olive oil works wonders. will definitely help InshaAllah. plus yoghurt & mustard oil combo is very effective too.
3099 2018-06-20 17:37:32 Everyone's been so crazy kind and supportive despite the fact I fell off the face of the world and everyone's support has been anointing oil to my stone heart so thanks.
3100 2018-06-20 17:37:30 Nifty. Looks like a fun project. I'm surprised that you used regular fans in the oil. Those will need to work much harder to push oil than air, and may draw more current than expected.

3114 2018-06-20 17:35:54 Car was able to be fixed  and might as well get the oil changed
3115 2018-06-20 17:35:51 Na budgetary issue . Once our budget system works perfectly well and oil price is stable, we should be able to complete projects
3116 2018-06-20 17:35:44 I need to make these flyers for my brake oil change & tune up package . Somebody fuck w me I got you
3117 2018-06-20 17:35:39 So let me get this straight...

1) Trump is very easily manipulated - a puppet, if you will.

2) You’re implying that spending 10 days with this administration was long enough to give you expert insight into the inner workings.

3) They have yet to drill your head for oil.
3118 2018-06-20 17:35:27 To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion,
to give unto them beauty for ashes,
the oil of joy for mourning,
the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness;
that they might be called trees of righteousness,
the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified. —Isaiah 61:3
3119 2018-06-20 17:35:23 There is no law requiring separation of children and parents on the books. You a lying sociopath. And pathetic. But that’s how snake oil salesmen work. So, good job liar; it’s definitely helping with your objective to be a dictator.
3120 2018-06-20 17:35:14 Yes, Israel is pure bullshit, start to finish, it's a US and UK regional chess piece for imperial acquisition of oil, it NEVER had anything to do with anyone being Jewish. It's a sick, sick place. Human rights not allowed.
3121 2018-06-20 17:35:09 @Carl_C_Icahn being busy with $SD shows how even the smartest investors have a tough time understanding the oil patch.

3123 2018-06-20 17:34:49 We know the interests in Raiply, Menengai Oil, Timsales and Kabras so this sugar issue will go NOWHERE. We know the interest in the Patel farm, that is why the dam issue will go NOWHERE. Kenyans our country is run by mafia like cartels, let's just accept it and move on

3135 2018-06-20 17:33:39 Dave when did a country with as much resources as Scotland has not had customers. Consider, England requires Scots energy, electricity, water, fish, petrol, oil, whisky. Scotland never said it would stop trading it would be in Englands interests to trade with Scotland

3145 2018-06-20 17:32:22 A small independent country, about 3.5 million people, no oil, no whisky, legal cannabis and twice winners of the World Cup. Ok Scotland, you know what to do :-)
3146 2018-06-20 17:32:22 Oil is still necessary at this point in time but two things. 1/If we want to continue to have it we should reduce its use and 2/We are moving past using oil in many areas. The goal is, I would think, doing each day better than yesterday and using our knowledge to accomplish that.
3147 2018-06-20 17:32:14 Would just like to say I wasn’t sweaty today I just went a bit overkill with the rose oil

3153 2018-06-20 17:31:32 I didn’t realize my jar of coconut oil was melted. (It’s hot in here I guess?) When I opened it half the jar splattered on my kitchen floor. I must have done a shitty job cleaning it up. I slipped and fell.
3154 2018-06-20 17:31:29 I know. There are a couple in my family as well. I honestly don't understand- the oil reason is not solid, but at least it KIND OF makes sense - what really gets me is people they have said their policies will harm support them. I wish i understood
3155 2018-06-20 17:31:28 I oil my scalp on my own time and I have a stylist that takes care of them other than that. I'm not even sure what exactly she uses for the retwists lol.
3156 2018-06-20 17:31:24 What, no disavow?
Or blaming big oil
Or the Koch brothers?

Man, Democrats are slipping
3157 2018-06-20 17:31:19 Actually it’s a low oil pressure light. Either you are low on oil or your oil has deteriorated to the point it is no longer capable of keeping consistent oil pressure needed for proper lubrication

3159 2018-06-20 17:31:09 look at the body language. The arrogance is oozing out of the prick.
He's like the "boss" that the car salesman bring out to close a deal. A misplaced sense of superiority that makes you stand up and walk away for fear of drowning in oil.
3160 2018-06-20 17:31:09 No, sadly, that's not what this means. This means lowering regulations on pollution, giving his friends oil rights (the right to drill, which always releases pollutants). 

It may include raising limits on fishing hauls. In other words, the exact opposite of what most of us want.
3161 2018-06-20 17:31:07 My wife made some essentials oil soap from the same brand but I don’t know if it was peppermint. Is peppermint the best?
3162 2018-06-20 17:31:05 ‘Dude it’s telling me I have to get an oil change in 2 months and I’m getting one right now’ ..... we’re in my car
3163 2018-06-20 17:31:04 Did he dip his hand into crude oil?
3164 2018-06-20 17:31:02 มาม่าไง 5555555
3165 2018-06-20 17:31:00 Oil free. I was scared it would look too matte but it still looks very natural
3166 2018-06-20 17:31:00 To me it's Shredded Wheat Bits soaked in oil and dusted with flavored sugar. Way too rich and heavy.
3167 2018-06-20 17:30:58 MCT Oil is fantastic, and you should definitely keep it. In my opinion, I would not break the fast with it, but rather use it mid-day as an afternoon pick-me-up. That would go perfect in a coffee or tea a couple of hours after lunch. Play around and see how you feel!
3168 2018-06-20 17:30:57 Isn’t that the oil pressure light?
3169 2018-06-20 17:30:55 If they didn't put their capital at risk to explore for & develop oil I doubt u or I would be living here
3170 2018-06-20 17:30:48 AOSTRA? You should read Turner's book The Patch if you haven't.  Important to remember there were a lot of failed ventures that looked a lot like AOSTRA. Tech mattered to oil sands, but nothing mattered more than prices in driving the boom.
3171 2018-06-20 17:30:38 @JamaicanOil how do you use this oil for hair growth???
3172 2018-06-20 17:30:38 If your man can’t help you fix your car or at least know the basics like fixing the brakes, changing a flat tire, or changing the oil .. throw him away and get a new man

3176 2018-06-20 17:30:22 While you are about it.
Pl mention that as US is “Not a refugee camp” it would be helpful for everyone else if US were to stop creating waves of refugees in the Middle East in order to secure cheap oil

3178 2018-06-20 17:30:11 Ah! That makes sense. This is apparently pure oil.
3179 2018-06-20 17:30:09 Spoke to a somebody studying law at university who has #Crohn’s disease  - she said she takes #Cannabis oil and last resort smokes it to stop muscle pain; as well  as helping her to sleep & eat - she told me to not reveal her name. UK drug policy is silencing people needing help.

3181 2018-06-20 17:30:00 mainly for flavour, some people add butter and some add oil. It prevents it from becoming too sticky

3183 2018-06-20 17:29:50 I made your berry crumble today, but I used apple and cinnamon, and I also ran out of butter so I used a mixture of olive oil and coconut oil, and I reduced the sugar and it’s not even the same thing anymore but it’s still DELICIOUS

3186 2018-06-20 17:29:19 Responding to your fourth point, wouldn’t a organization such as the one that helped with investment in the oil sands during their early stages prove more effective? I forget the name of it
3187 2018-06-20 17:29:12 Goodyear and a Honda Accord coupe. It takes synthetic oil though 
3188 2018-06-20 17:28:58 Also........dissolving in alcohol doesnt make essential oil......just fragrance.......you would need to extract with a carrier oil for that or other, more complex methods....

3191 2018-06-20 17:28:24 URUGUAY (1) vs SAUDI ARABIA (0)

Uruguay a non oil producing state just like our dear LAGOS state had an increased IGR and a buoyant economy.

It edged out BAYELSA state(SAUDI ARABIA) despite it's monthly 13% derivation on oil.

OIL money couldn't prevent them from going down.
3192 2018-06-20 17:27:50 love to pledge fealty to extremely rich oil barons due to nationalism
3193 2018-06-20 17:27:43 I do not believe that the two are contradictory. I think it will be good for Syrians if Iran & Iraq string oil & gas pipelines across Syria. I also think it is good if, through rebuilding, Syria is able to distance itself fr Iran & rebuild relations w Gulf and neighboring states
3194 2018-06-20 17:27:28 And this is after almost 18 months of acne treatments I was so scared this was gonna break me out but rpse hip oil has been the best thing for my skin
3195 2018-06-20 17:27:25 Interesting. Yeah I was looking at doing the 12-8 window. Or even 11-7. I drink hot tea in the mornings though with mct oil and collagen and I’m trying to figure out if I should push that back so it doesn’t mess with the fast. But I know some people do bulletproof IF.
3196 2018-06-20 17:27:24 Have you ever seen a cat so soft they look like an oil painting
3197 2018-06-20 17:27:20 Pomade, coconut oil, aquaphor 

And yes... hair police for your crusty head 
3198 2018-06-20 17:27:14 If you dont eat fish or much food at all, at least take supplements. 
Fish oil and turmeric (curcumin) with black pepper too to prevent future illness and diseases like Alzheimer's and dementia.
3199 2018-06-20 17:27:04 Yes. Add to that the fact that sustaining high-ish #oil production levels was not reconciled with any type of economic benefit + the audit bureau's report and you get a #Libya-n community that prefers watching the world cup to worrying about a wealth they do not use burning.

3212 2018-06-20 17:25:41 Yup. Also the absence of certain players or certain transactions from the market itself.. keeps everybody guessing and price not moving in any solid direction.. as is happening these past few days. But yea peoples apathy towards their oil being burnt looks like a big fuck you.

3222 2018-06-20 17:24:00 Most vehicles driven under normal circumstances can go more than 3,000 miles between oil changes - check your vehicle's manual and follow that guideline.
3223 2018-06-20 17:23:47 Olive oil? She should tell that to the hundreds of millions of people that live in the Mediterranean Region.
3224 2018-06-20 17:23:36 doubt we see this at even 50% of midwestern gas locations in my lifetime.  Big Oil makes too much money cracking crude to give up 5% more to ethanol.
3225 2018-06-20 17:23:26 Valid points, but payments of tax makes citizens bcom more involved with governance, this will deepen and reinforce d fight against corruption. No politician will just b faffing around using out tax to oppress us as it is easy to do with oil money, which we all think is a gift

3237 2018-06-20 17:22:16 Interesting the dollar falling / for what is worth I feel many Libyans feel disconnected from the oil wealth - it’s mostly cash into currupt politicians hands - oil production goes up and down but Libyan livelihood not altered much
3238 2018-06-20 17:22:02 @BoschToolsNA hi purchased Isio garden tool from @ArgosHelpers just opened it today. The item attachments have what seem like oil on the area when it attaches to the main device is this normal?

3242 2018-06-20 17:21:37 I'm seeing them every where. They sponsored the oil and gas conference this week, their CEOs are accompanying Obama on his transit, and they've set up shop in Nairobi

3243 2018-06-20 17:21:26 HELL yeah the best part is going into a camp, hiding and then shooting the oil urns when the guards pass by so it spills on hay and then shooting a fire arrow and watching the total mayhem
3244 2018-06-20 17:21:16 But in the real world, oil prices are going up. Are we driving them up to drive them down? Is that how Trump's brilliant strategy works?

I’m going to miss her.

3253 2018-06-20 17:20:08 So the issue is - if international coordination isn't happening, does it still make sense for Canada to act? I would argue that it does, for self-interested reasons: if we don't, people will attack the oil sands as a scapegoat.
3254 2018-06-20 17:20:02 All I wanted was an oil change.

3262 2018-06-20 17:19:30 you're right, it doesn't.

3289 2018-06-20 17:15:30 I agree about the whole apriori-expost facto part. The act was known prehand and cant easily be glossed now. But Reprehensible or criminal are definitions an outside observer can use. But as Libyans, nothing fits a mutually correct definition of terrorism as destroying oil infra.

Without fighting corruption and make looting offences carry death penalty to serve as deterrence, they will loot the money again. @HMKemiAdeosun
3294 2018-06-20 17:14:51 The problem is, the Canadian oil sands are too big for us to say we don't matter. With carbon pricing, we're doing our part to get on the IEA 450 ppm price path. If we do nothing (Harper's approach), people worried about climate change will seize on the oil sands as a scapegoat.

3304 2018-06-20 17:13:59 But Norway has only 5 million people. It produces about the same amount of natural gas and half the oil. It has a good market and geographical location because Europe has little oil and gas and they have no problem building pipelines. In Canada, equalization payments & no pipelns

3316 2018-06-20 17:12:56 Scott Anderson, Director of the Division of Waste Management reported to the Natural Resources and Environment Committe that since 1995, 235,00 gallons of used oil has been collected. #utpol #utleg
3317 2018-06-20 17:12:56 My work is closed for two weeks and my moonlighting gig doesn't start till tomorrow. Consequently, I'm drunk at the bowling alley my company owns because it's half off and I got pissed that I couldn't get an oil change. Conquering the day as it were.

3325 2018-06-20 17:11:45 Always finding someone to blame yet never achieve any meaningful thing. Is this time your fellow president are signing budget. What about the project you inserted last year, did you account for them . Oil subsidy , Lagos - Ibadan Expressway etc.
3326 2018-06-20 17:11:33 This would be my 1st choice for sure... if Oil could make it happen.
3327 2018-06-20 17:11:19 Golden sand & pink sugar the best oil scents 
3328 2018-06-20 17:11:08 @firsNigeria is right, if we all pay tax, there will be a sense of entitlement, which will make citizen demand more probity & accountability from elected officers, but with oil, we were more of rent seekers, nobody wz putting anytin in but we all wanted to take out
3329 2018-06-20 17:10:58 Probably works for Argentina, Saudi on the other hand...might want to stick to other performance indicators (economy, reforms, regulation, ‘corruption’, oil, etc)

=> OPB = Np + Net barrels in storage

Where Np = OOIP - Remaining reserves

And OOIP is Original Oil in Place

3341 2018-06-20 17:10:02 Fracking doesn't keep oil & gas down, the blowout preventer does that. Fracking has one purpose, to break up the ground to release more gas & or oil. If you wish to ban fracking, it should include the North Sea, or you're hypocrites.

3343 2018-06-20 17:09:33 Oil seems to be everywhere except here. But that’s the irony. How can oil be everywhere beside and around us but none to be found in our jurisdiction? Seems very oily to me.
3344 2018-06-20 17:09:27 Someone come massage coconut oil into my hair while I do my homework I deserve it

3349 2018-06-20 17:08:33 Where do you get that Norway have 10 times more share of oil, the field was split in half.  Westminster basically gave the oil to BP and charge a tax on what is extracted. Norway extract the oil and take all the money.
3350 2018-06-20 17:08:13 I meant coconut oil and sugar scrub 
3351 2018-06-20 17:08:07 Drinking a lot of water, rosehip oil is my favourite Kora product(ikut mirinda kerr ) it protect/saves my skin when I’m switching between drastically different climates. and please don't judge me 
3352 2018-06-20 17:08:02 All this time I thought my skin was oily but I was constantly dehydrated so my skin was overcompensating by over producing oil. Now that I’m hydrated I’m actually lowkey dry. What is life lol

3363 2018-06-20 17:06:45 I imagine there will be a huge cultural battle,  the law changing will mean nothing as long as the guardianship system continues plus the motives behind it are more to do with oil than feminism 
3364 2018-06-20 17:06:34 Russia exists and is a nuclear power. We kicked them over Syria, we are kicking them on oil prices (They need the price high because they have oil but it is expensive to get out of the ground). Saying nice things or putting them back in the G8 are all FREE. :)
3365 2018-06-20 17:06:32 energy east should be built only the piss poor leadership in this country allows foreign oil to be tankered down the st lawrence making our enemies financially stronger
3366 2018-06-20 17:06:31 The N9.12 trillion version passed by the National Assembly contained an increase of N508 billion over and above the N8.612 trillion originally presented by President Buhari. The oil benchmark price was also increased from the US$45 submitted to US$51.

3377 2018-06-20 17:04:38 The “African Growth and Opportunity Act” has always been a disingenuous name when about 90% of exports to the US under it have consistently been oil and gas products. It may be one of the few instances in which paranoia about the US being motivated by oil seems valid.

3412 2018-06-20 17:01:06 Because obviously that isn't working. The US doesn't mind butting in when oil is involved so why not try something else then people wouldn't be fleeing?

3425 2018-06-20 17:00:03 Did you know: Heating oil doesn't ignite until its temperature reaches 140 degrees, when it vaporizes. So, if you dropped a lit match into heating oil, the flame would extinguish on contact.

3435 2018-06-20 16:59:28 Congratulations man. MCT oil is apparently good to fight off snack cravings. It's high in fat but they're good fats so you don't eat the bad kind. Also, if you dig green tea, it will really jolt your metabolism, esp when combined with exercise. Good luck MJ
3436 2018-06-20 16:59:28 Stock market down. Gas prices up. Oil heading up. Pushing allies away. Coddling dictators. Out of NAFTA, Paris Clumate Agreement, Iran deal  and  U.N. Human Rights Council.

3439 2018-06-20 16:59:16 GNA and Jadhran are on the same team? Meaning we can thank them for the millions of dollars of loss revenue and destruction of oil infrastructure. They keep going in the same circles using spoilers and warlords as a means to an end.

3449 2018-06-20 16:57:59 And yet the predecessor of Ayatollah Khomeni supported the nationalization of oil and a transition to Islamic socialism, which was where Iran was headed at the time. An assassination attempt on the Shah was the nail in the coffin

3462 2018-06-20 16:56:46 Make sure you’re using cotton things like a T-shirt to dry your hair. Try sleeping with a silk wrap or pillow case. I like using AU Naturale hair butter to keep my hair soft and moisturizer and also massage your scalp (not hair) daily with some type of  natural oil

3465 2018-06-20 16:56:17 FWIW the one I like is called Lao Gan Ma Spicy Chili Crisp. It's red with a picture of a person on the bottle. Also I did not remember about that Rick and Morty thing until I tried to find the brand name, that's not what this is, actual chili oil is super good.

3471 2018-06-20 16:55:52 When in actuality he makes himself look weak and misguided every time he speaks. But he is the king of snake oil salesmanship. And just as all through history there are those that buy what snake oil salesmen sell.
3472 2018-06-20 16:55:41 if there was another country of political interest doing that, the U.S would be talking shit and "sending help"  (double points if that country had oil they would be sending troops)

3477 2018-06-20 16:55:14 Because weather changes so quickly, dependant on very small inputs. A scientist will however be much more accurate in predicting the weather than an oil Barron.

3479 2018-06-20 16:55:05 Would I be right in saying that the wee cottage on the right was occupied by a very very old lady until maybe the 1980s. I kind of remember my dad taking me there and she had no electricity... just oil/gas lamps!
3480 2018-06-20 16:55:01 Where do you get the nerve to beat Saudi Arabia?! What if they decide to stop giving u their oil smh #Worldcup2018Russia #worldcup
3481 2018-06-20 16:54:56 What we are witnessing is a coordinated effort by the Democrats and the media to draw attention away from the Congressional hearings on FBI/DOJ corruption that was essentially a soft coup attempt against a sitting President ... all with the Media assisting them.
3482 2018-06-20 16:54:55 So why didn't they take any action if they had the data ??? They would have got enough data after demon which helped them strike off. 'data is the new oil' let's not forget ....and yes ... I Didn't mind merry going around even if didn't give visible  benefits

3486 2018-06-20 16:54:38 Wild orange - is a citrus oil and is known as one of the best oils for mood enhancing. I call it one of my happy oils since it improves blood movement and cleanses the liver and gall bladder, it also helps relieve the body from panic.
3487 2018-06-20 16:54:36 Agreed.  I fear we will end up fighting an actual war here, Because the left has officially exited reality and have lost their minds.
3488 2018-06-20 16:54:33 I love antoni but how can he put cauliflower in the oven to roast with just olive oil and salt?? where is the garlic?? the spice?? sorry but i’m shocked

3490 2018-06-20 16:54:03 Not in 2011, America armed rebel groups to depose Assad as he wasn't cutting deals with you over oil and gas etc. Depose Assad, stick in American patsy. Oldest American trick.

3499 2018-06-20 16:53:18 It's CBD oil. I've given it to my own son to see if it helps with ADHD. It's 100% legal & non psychoactive. This headline is misleading & is an attempt at damaging her reputation.

3524 2018-06-20 16:50:11 "Human activities such as burning of coal, oil and gasoline are releasing more of those gases into the atmosphere, especially CO2."
It's not just the greenhouse gases - it's the HEAT from burning these fuels that is boosting their action by raising the air temperature MUCH faster
3525 2018-06-20 16:50:11 Lavender oil is great for anxiety.  It’s considered a nervous system restorative & helps support peace, sleep, restlessness, irritability, panic attacks, nervous stomach.  A number of clinical trials involving the inhalation of lavender indicated a reduction in stress and anxiety

3539 2018-06-20 16:48:24 The @CNBCFuturesNow hit on oil was cancelled --my thoughts are OPEC won't change levels --would be economic suicide with US production growing and demand flat
3540 2018-06-20 16:48:15 According to US FDA, intake of food containing plant sterols twice a day reduces heart attack risks. "Vibhavari" Cold Pressed Groundnut oil is also high in vitamin E which is also an antioxidant and protects the cells from damage.

3542 2018-06-20 16:48:07 This is completely & totally valid.  
In medicine, many things like opiates, alcohol & e.g. cannabis oil, can make the life of a person bearable, liveable & normal. The abuse of such medications (all of these) by idiots is irrelevant to their beneficial use in medicine.

3573 2018-06-20 16:44:53 As far as trading WTI goes today, the Geezer Oil Trader in Houston just told me that "if you're trading WTI today it's like a miniature horse at a water trough: You've got to be on your toes.."

3575 2018-06-20 16:44:48 All he did was spin words and more false accusations and excuses, spoken like a tent revival preacher selling snake oil 
3576 2018-06-20 16:44:46 too bad Canada said it was going to participate then....   you need to call out lies,  like  exporting a multiple of oil and gas while pretending to curb emissions  -  nice photo op with no substance seems to be  #pmjt  whole  terms legacy on this file - oh, and carbon tax?

And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him

Stopped river Niger dredging????  So who started it before he stopped it? 
Oil?? Which oil?

3592 2018-06-20 16:43:14 But this is the oil you want! You LOVE third world oil from backwards nations with no standards and this is the oil that is imported daily into Canada ... THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT AND THIS WHAT CANADA CONTRIBUTES TO!
3593 2018-06-20 16:43:11 Rub your hands with oil before slicing next time.
3594 2018-06-20 16:42:44 Lmao YESSSS!!! Tea tree oil is amazing! I don’t see how people be sleep on it! It’s like majic in a bottle.

3597 2018-06-20 16:42:23 All American military are terrorists.   You're not defending the constitution by killing innocents for oil, gas, poppy, and whatever else corporations need to destroy the planet.
3598 2018-06-20 16:42:18 I'd love to see Wayne in an Oil jersey.  #Oilers
3599 2018-06-20 16:42:18 That wasn't the point. The point is if Kenney's donors are oil patch interests, those interests, many of them, are foreign. The oil itself isn't giving him donations or attending his fundraisers. While foreign investors play a role, they have no business influencing gov't here.
3600 2018-06-20 16:42:16 I put castor oil on my lashes and my whole damn eyes are oily they’re bothering me
3601 2018-06-20 16:42:09 I might have to see if vegetable oil really works in place of gas. My wallet can’t keep fillin up this car

3603 2018-06-20 16:41:54 Find out what they are running for their lives from and fix it and you won't have a border problem. Ho that's right on oil to steal like Venezuela has. the country with one of the best democratic elections in the world. Much better than ours.  This is much cheaper than your wall.
3604 2018-06-20 16:41:47 At today's luncheon, speaker Deborah Yedlin discusses the need for innovation in the energy sector, global trends for energy and provides her thoughts on the challenges facing the oil & gas industry for 2018 and beyond. #noia2018
3605 2018-06-20 16:41:37 Lets talk about Anxiety 
Anxiety is a tough battle to face day in and day out, which makes having a natural solution, such as an essential oil blend, important.
3606 2018-06-20 16:41:29 Did they oil up #Suga or what? He’s killin me with the cuteness
3607 2018-06-20 16:41:26 I’ve started listening to different investment podcast. Pay attention to what the S&P, gold, oil, the 10 yr us bond, and the vix index are doing daily. Those are key market identifiers.
3608 2018-06-20 16:41:26 Waffle cut fries are better due to more potato surface area exposed to the oil and ketchup.
3609 2018-06-20 16:41:25 Living the dream.  I'm covered in oil replacing the brake calipers on my excursion truck. A sledgehammer was deployed a moment ago. 
3610 2018-06-20 16:41:01 Our mission is simple: to create systems that allow a clean oil and gas industry to emerge. Advanced technology and modern computing are how we’re implementing change, says Meade Lewis.

3611 2018-06-20 16:41:00 Thanks, Clare. It was supposed to be an underpainting for an oil, but I think it’s rebelling against me. 
3612 2018-06-20 16:40:54 How about shove your wall up your ass how about give families running from terrorist refuge in our country how about send our troops to their countries and take care of these little druggies ruining people's lives down there or is there no oil to steel @maddow @MSNBC @funder
3613 2018-06-20 16:40:42 HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HOPE OIL!!!! 
okay ang benta nice
3614 2018-06-20 16:40:39 I suggest you stop the hypocrisy. Don’t use anything with oil, cells phone, Tv, radio, no food, clothing etc quit being a hypocrite unless you stop using any petroleum based products your contributing to the problem. Also stop breathing you are producing CO2!!
3615 2018-06-20 16:40:38 Also, use olive oil + pinch of salt instead of butter. 
High quality Bacon rashes much better for you than processed turkey rashes. 
High quality black pudding (not heavily processed, from butchers) also very good for you

3620 2018-06-20 16:40:15 Yes, but not irrelevant for 2 reasons:

1) Setting diff gold/oil ratio (phys only) thru CNY gives PBOC ability to ctrl int'l trade value of the USD.

2) China can print CNY, not USD - means China then ctrls own destiny vis a vis current acct & commodity imports.

3622 2018-06-20 16:40:10 Unburnable carbon #Unburnablecarbon is a term used for fossil fuel deposits in the ground.  Fossil fuels are coal, oil,  and gas which is still the primary energy powering the global economy #climatetweets

3631 2018-06-20 16:39:28 Hey liars of the GOP n Fox why don't we help get their country back instead of letting MS 13 gang kill the kids and families. We go over seas and start wars when we want their oil,diamonds, or gold.
3632 2018-06-20 16:39:17 Drink at least 8 glasses of water daily, a gallon if you can, never touch your face, don’t put lotion or anything with a scent on your face just coconut oil
3633 2018-06-20 16:39:06 #Oilers home opener sounds like it will be Thursday, October 18th. So, that means there will be a few stops on the way home from Sweden, where the Oil open their season on 10/6.
3634 2018-06-20 16:38:56 Now who’s the fool. What do you think Russia’s economy is....oil. This only further entrenches to reliance on carbon, disincentivizing green tech for foreseeable future. Our isolationism and G7 overtures plays to his desire in breaking the western democratic front. You’re a pawn
3635 2018-06-20 16:38:51 Neem oil ..Will work

3638 2018-06-20 16:38:29 HAPPENING NOW: House @NatResources is marking up four bills that would severely roll back bedrock environmental laws that protect health, empower citizens to speak out and safeguard our public lands. RT to tell Congress to #ProtectYourVoice not the oil and gas industry.
3639 2018-06-20 16:38:29 Some of you on here  are very ignorant ! Aberdeen is the oil capital of Europe and a decent football team considering the financial clout of the Old firm . Don’t be to sure Burnley are through !!
3640 2018-06-20 16:38:20 Witches’ Hazel as an inexpensive, natural toner in AM (reduce oil, shrink pores, prevent break outs) & even as a blemish spot treatment at night. It’s so mild & calming, unlike a lot of chemical astringents. And Vitamin E oil for preventing/reducing scars (including acne scars).
3641 2018-06-20 16:38:18 It will cause you to burn or tan really well so keep that in mind with your skin tone but the heat will cause the oil to deep into your pores and will extremely hydrate your skin
3642 2018-06-20 16:38:09 I think Twitter deserves a story on the details of waste water injection and how the courts are now open to citizens seeking litigation against oil companies.
3643 2018-06-20 16:38:03 they playing “I Like It” at Midas, while my car gets an oil change.  yeaaahh

#swans
3645 2018-06-20 16:38:01 They always do it. Even for our car, a small oil leak for which they changed the entire part and billed 74000..hope they give the same importance to after sales service like they do when you go to buy a car.
3646 2018-06-20 16:37:58 Most peaceful thing right now. Lying in my garden vaping my #CBD oil and watching the clouds go by. But still can’t help letting my mind wonder to thoughts of all the animals out there suffering 
3647 2018-06-20 16:37:53 Yes, because this tweet is carting loads of children off into cages, illegally making oil pipes through sacred land and fucking up water sources, and pulled us out of the UN....

OK.

3652 2018-06-20 16:37:26 Take a spray bottle of cool water and spray it down before you get in. Also, moisturize before you get in if you can with any lotion. If you can’t before you get in, it sounds gross but take some coconut oil and put on your skin and sit in the sun for as long as you want...
3653 2018-06-20 16:37:20 I adore everything I've tried from the range so far - the hair oil is my favourite

3681 2018-06-20 16:35:07 I’m guessing I must be a robot since I can never solve the Captcha puzzle of selecting pictures of cars that need oil changes.
3682 2018-06-20 16:34:39 I seriously need a oil change for my car, but I don't want to go to the dealership.

3684 2018-06-20 16:34:08 I’ll never go cheap on a haircut again. These city cuts may be expensive but won’t pass up on the tea tree shampoo scrubs and a coconut oil massage after. 
3685 2018-06-20 16:33:59 @POTUS regarding the boarder. Force Mexico to fix their country by pulling all import goods, oil, clothes, etc. We won't trade with them. Completely close them off. Build that Wall!

3692 2018-06-20 16:32:45 This post seems designed to be damage control. I can’t imagine how a blogger “communicates differently” simply by having their blog appear on this platform. That sounds like some snake oil marketing.
3693 2018-06-20 16:32:42 accidentally dumped half a saucepan of hot oil on my hand. silver lining: i just learned how to care for burns in my first aid training! and i have the necessary supplies too! life ain’t so bad right?

3709 2018-06-20 16:30:29 Saudi Arabia should stick to selling oil
3710 2018-06-20 16:30:17 Depends upon OPEC meeting right now. I think if they increase production by more than 500k bbls/day WTI oil drops to low 60s. Otherwise it might sustain or turn up. I did better on $RDS.A $EQNR that is tied to Brent pricing.  Would like to get back in on weakness.
3711 2018-06-20 16:30:08 Returning to just human size brings culture round us like a shawl. We can wear it – a durable vestment died with both personal & community colours. We can divest from identity levelling, but powerful provisions of oil. They are, in any case much too large to fit.
3712 2018-06-20 16:30:07 oh gawd i need oil

3717 2018-06-20 16:29:44 And when the BP oil spill happened many fishermen or the tourist industry wasn’t even interviewed. They lied abt the magnitude of harm. We already know how corporations work. They minimize harm when they do the utmost harm. I expect more of this without any laws protecting.
3718 2018-06-20 16:29:41 Reminds me of Psalms 23: 1 The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want. 2 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. 5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
3719 2018-06-20 16:29:35 Not sure why would think that. Liberals do it at college campuses across the country. They do it at rallies and lectures. They even do it outside of Trump Tower. Not only is the left insane, they're extremely dangerous
3720 2018-06-20 16:29:18 China has many options in an Escalation Ladded of a Trade War with 

1) Targetting Soybeans, Pork & other American Agro Products with Tariffs.

2) Target  Hydrocarbon & energy sector like American Crude & LNG, Coal with Tariffs & replace them with Iranian/Saudi Oil or Russian Gas

3731 2018-06-20 16:27:39 China said last week it would put tariffs on U.S. oil imports. The U.S. is not a major oil exporter, but it has been growing exports and is exporting about 2 million barrels a day of crude.

I'll attach a link to report just released by the IEA that goes into some considerable detail regarding global energy consumption.

3778 2018-06-20 16:22:32 Saute the celery, pepper, and onion in 2 tbsp olive oil over medium heat. When they are somewhat soft (and ideally browning a little), add the garlic and almost immediately add the tomatoes. Drain, rinse, and add the beans. Add the seasoning, raisins, and vinegar.

3794 2018-06-20 16:20:07 Oh and you'll need 2 tbsp olive oil.

(To clarify on veggies, that's basically one medium-large onion and 1 very large or 2 medium bell peppers.)

Clean and chop the celery and bell pepper, removing seeds and pith. Chop the onion and garlic.
3795 2018-06-20 16:19:54 3rd, if 11% isnt a good number what is? 50%? But then why is 50% a good number in the work force for any industry? If it is, I dont see feminist arguing for 50% equity in oil rig workers or any of the other more dangerous male dominated professions.

3851 2018-06-20 16:15:16 When a client emails nothing but “you around?” 

When you’re trying to book a service... an oil change, dentist apt, etc- you wouldn’t dream of sending such a weird useless fucking email. 

Around what? The earth? Yes I am existing on the earth. Go fuck yourself.

3858 2018-06-20 16:14:28 I highly reccomend a vegan diet. It's hard to commit to if you're not trying to save animal lives (which I'm not) but its surprisingly healthy and drops weight quick. I do a protein shake consisting of almond butter, flax seed, chia seed, mct oil, almond milk, turmeric and water

3877 2018-06-20 16:12:46 Petrol ₹80 but diesel ₹58 litre in Jordon.

Jordon is not oil rich country. Now it has high inflation due to refugees. Jordon's own population is ~9million & they have ~6million Syrian & ~2million Iraqi refugees. So 45% people in Jordon now poor refugees. India isn't war torn.

3915 2018-06-20 16:08:47 and since those months have passed we have seen Europe effectively  reach saturation in Light crude and most Asian refiners just displacing Light crude oil with US shale. Only China seems to be be absorbing more light crude than before and that is purely political.

3924 2018-06-20 16:07:48 Sorry, that doesn't make sense. We're already manufacturing cars, so changing from oil to electricity doesn't increase the total number cars built, so the embedded carbon doesn't go up.

Or, you presumed facts not in evidence, or a point I'm missing.

3927 2018-06-20 16:07:39 Good evening, Primrose (oil).
3928 2018-06-20 16:07:36 Saudi Arabia is not just the most stable oil exporters, but among the most stable countries in the region. US has its bases there and also uses the Kingdom to influence the region. It is not ideal, but it could be worse.
3929 2018-06-20 16:07:13 The market clearly needs additional oil supply in the second half and “I’m confident that at the end of the day reason will prevail” in this week’s OPEC+ talks, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih tells reporters in Vienna.

4041 2018-06-20 15:53:57 The confidence of these oil merchants is top notch. Good passing, skills. Look a balanced team. Uruguayan containment is savage. Only thing laking is chance creation. Their passing in the final 3rd is in shambles. Hope they improve this in next half. #URUKSA #FIFAWorldCup

Right now, oil is "wtf"ing. Let's hope we get the big selloff before the meeting.

4045 2018-06-20 15:53:31 Oh ... I don't know - even if that's the case (and I suspect the Koch bros have their hands in Kenney as well), most of the Alberta oil patch is controlled by US interests ...

4075 2018-06-20 15:50:26 From oil exporting country view point I'd say trade war will affect oil prices.

4136 2018-06-20 15:44:12 @tvcnewsng @EstherTVCnews @VOnuchiTVC @togunjobiTVC The sliding of the price of oil from the OPEC group is worrying!
4137 2018-06-20 15:44:11 What about all the other countries that do the same? China, Russia, Philippines...

Also the countries you mentioned have arms & oil deals with the US. 
So you're saying US is corrupt & aligned with the values of countries they praise and do business with?

4151 2018-06-20 15:42:18 Okay, the CP foundation really oxidized with oil today. I have to restart
4152 2018-06-20 15:42:12 Hello, #KSA. You have a lot of oil, but Sendic, our former president of ANCAP (I'm sure you know ANCAP) said that we will find oil here, too.

4155 2018-06-20 15:41:49 This is a bunch of carefully worded propaganda, the ocean isn’t a factory, we shouldn’t be worrying about it’s economy but it’s ecology, over fishing and oil drilling may stimulate the economy but they destroy the environment and are unsustainable in every way
4156 2018-06-20 15:41:46 Some larger Tesco or Asian supermarkets do the hair oil in big bottles.  Would stuff for afro hair suit or is it not that course/curly?
4157 2018-06-20 15:41:44 Another -ve is, the beginning of the end of oil use for mobility. With lesser demand for petrodollars globally how will US fund its deficit 2 decades from now. Huge shift in energy imports to domestic energy sourcing & independence.

4165 2018-06-20 15:41:20 I would put him on a diet and give him 0 sugar treats and keep using the muzzle. Limiting his sugar intake will help give you a better idea of what could be going on. Or, it simply could be the way he stands. Make sure you’re putting conditioner on his feet (su-per oil is great)

4178 2018-06-20 15:40:28 It's incredibly sad the medical community takes so long to adapt. But using cannabis oil can require a total shift in the medications used (e.g., elevated liver enzymes with depakote). A ketogenic diet is also promising for some.

4184 2018-06-20 15:39:22 Hence the need to enforce laws. I would much rather see those that are criminals being pursued vs ignored. You don't care about humans being force into slavery? Oil is a resource, humans will go to war over resources. Oil is so intricate to our daily lives now.

4214 2018-06-20 15:35:44 In the late 1970s there was an olive oil scam in which someone bought up a multiple of the market for the next several years. Didn't step back to do the simple arithnetuc

4221 2018-06-20 15:35:12 What about tea tree oil shampoo? We had some that got similar reactions when it was hot and they sweat - the shampoo you can get at Target worked better than fancy medicated stuff.
4222 2018-06-20 15:35:07 Chart looks to be Malaysia and the sell off there in 14 was real --Malaysia among other things exports oil and gas, so it was hit hard

4224 2018-06-20 15:35:01 This rainbow was created as oil on water, an unnatural mix, both with varied viscosity of ideology. Separation brought good relief to one, and good riddance to other. Time for @BJP4India to back its decision and pull J&K out of the dead pit now.

4286 2018-06-20 15:29:17 This is wrong and they know it. H.R. 6106 waives critical protections for environmental justice issues before approving oil & gas permits.

Republicans think this isn't a problem, as minorities & underserved communities can still sue after the fact. That's not right.

4329 2018-06-20 15:25:19 That's supply & demand. How does oil priced in CNY change that? If there are too many CNY and too few USD, oil price will go up in CNY and down in USD. Three asset arbitrage oil-USD-CNY, no?

4406 2018-06-20 15:18:00 Houston should be proud to have them. It is a city of immigrants, oil companies and space industry, cowboys and Rap artists. Took care of each other during Harvey. And home to the Astros!

4408 2018-06-20 15:17:47 @RepKevinBrady How long have you been selling snake oil? Why are you and so many of your colleagues afraid of Trump? He can end family separation immediately. Tell him to. You’re just another career politician worried about yourself. It was evident on CNN today.
4409 2018-06-20 15:17:39 Oil change done and car registration renewed. That’s enough adulting for the day.
4410 2018-06-20 15:17:34 Busy Day Selling Big Injun Oil!!
4411 2018-06-20 15:17:34 Thank you. Let me look it up. Just a few drops should do, yeah?
Bought rose water and chamomile oil already
4412 2018-06-20 15:17:30 tht midnight oil has been paid off . itsa worth 
4413 2018-06-20 15:17:28 ههههههههه بس حلوة
4414 2018-06-20 15:17:28 Brilliant at getting oil mind you
4415 2018-06-20 15:17:24 I got an idea.  Fuck legislation, right and left. Fuck bureaucracy. Do the right goddamn thing. Reunite these children with their families, now. Don’t wait for signatures and for oil and water to mix. They won’t.      Make kids smile and the world will be ok.
4416 2018-06-20 15:17:18 Saudi didnt get Iraqi oil. Iraq trades with China quite a bit. Became an Iranian ally - huge mistake. Noone gained from Iraq war except the Shia. We shouldve played it better. WMD components found by Special Forces in North Iraq after fighting Ansar Islam + WMD moved to Syria.
4417 2018-06-20 15:17:11 Can’t. The last is a slide about how our administration gutted a 100 year old law and now oil companies don’t have to pay fines for killing protected birds.
4418 2018-06-20 15:17:09 Hahaha oil will run out eventually don’t worry x
4419 2018-06-20 15:17:01 Try anything organic/raw with healing properties like vitamin E,Avocado,  grapeseed or coconut oil.. Ne Shea butter
4420 2018-06-20 15:17:01 Its when she tries to say oil . U get oral
4421 2018-06-20 15:16:56 It's not over yet! We will still screen each and every proposed oil and gas lease sale parcel for wildlife and wilderness characteristics and help people comment and protest these! Together we've gotten over 2 million acres deferred; we can do it again.
4422 2018-06-20 15:16:40  Apply in this order
-water
- Some oil ( JBCO, coconut)
- Gel/edge controle

 Invest in some good gel
( don’t buy one that dry them out or leave flakes

 Apply with edge brush or toothbrush

4424 2018-06-20 15:16:27 Today is expiration in July crude oil --#oott
4425 2018-06-20 15:16:22 Yes I am aware. But - again - a product that is 58% fish (of which 100% fish fillet), which has been shaped into a finger, coated with breadcrumbs, and with added water, oil, potato starch etc. is a processed product.
4426 2018-06-20 15:16:14 when you have strong numbers going in the opposite direction of gas and oil like today the most probably outcome is rotation without extension.  If it breaks that is a strong indicator of sentiment.  We were dealing 85s and might again but not seeing an edge now
4427 2018-06-20 15:16:09 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
4428 2018-06-20 15:16:05 Science does not stay frozen in 1955. Every year we advance on how to use less oil and how to create more efficient renewables all points to a very bad $4.5B Trudeau investment. 2030 technology will arrive like or not as will 2060 advancements.

4436 2018-06-20 15:15:35 @JohnGormleyShow : "many of the corporations that produce marijuana is organized crime" To confirm many of the corporation cartels like oil, communications, food, banking, etc... is organized crime. #justsaying
4437 2018-06-20 15:15:32 We're starting a podcast that will consist of people in the oil & gas industry telling the story of how they got started in oil & gas and lessons learned along the way. Of course, we'll also cover oil & gas accounting. What should we name the podcast?

4439 2018-06-20 15:15:22 How many babies are alive today b/c of the coal used to generate the electricity for their incubation chambers? What about the coal used to keep blood transfusion bags cool & refrigerated? We are living longer and better b/c of coal and oil. #Reason

4443 2018-06-20 15:15:06 How many train derailments of oil and or bitumen have there been in Alberta and BC in the last decade.? How many #pipeline spills?
4444 2018-06-20 15:14:59 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.

4452 2018-06-20 15:14:11 I follow & enjoy your tweets & learned about your family in the posts about the earthquake, etc. The oil industry is truly fascinating. Perhaps we can re-unite and collaborate on a story the relates your coverage and mine!

4455 2018-06-20 15:13:41 .@RepLouieGohmert & @RepGarretGraves are flat-out wrong.

H.R. 6106 makes it harder to protect minority & underserved communities from the public health impacts of pollution.

When will Republicans stand up for children & families instead of Big Oil & Gas?
4456 2018-06-20 15:13:38 Thanks Mike! Any chance of a hard semi transparent plastic dropper tube? I  prefer to squirt the CBD down my older dogs throat. I prefer not to add to his food as I have a puppy that Is an eating machine that will steal food , and don’t want getting into the oil just yet.
4457 2018-06-20 15:13:33 Been saying this for years. I work in the alternative transportation industry and electric anything is no more than a "pat myself on the back" lie.
4458 2018-06-20 15:13:32 I like chopping red baby potatoes into quarters, putting them on an oiled baking dish, and tossing them in a bit of olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic, then baking at 400 until fork tender.
4459 2018-06-20 15:13:32 Few viable businesses I can do with N100k

4460 2018-06-20 15:13:29 my feet and just SAT THERE EATING while I was standing there, the gutsy MFer. I mean I'd never hurt them but omg.

I hung the feeder lower and it has a fluted top but if I catch them messing with it again the cord holding the feeder is getting slathered with oil.
4461 2018-06-20 15:13:27 Try out the body shop men selection for face wash! I got my ex to try it out and I remember him liking it, and I also suggest rosehip oil!! A few drops, rub into hands, and press into the face and you’ll be a new man I swear.
4462 2018-06-20 15:13:18 Gym workout. Then i’m going to do a pre-traveling spa day. Lush bath bomb, bath oil, face mask  
I AM EXCITED!!
4463 2018-06-20 15:13:16 have had contact with him for some time NB is very approachable and a very level headed person. He knows his job and always loves to achieve investment value. Even if it sometimes takes a few years ie Nuog he’s been working on several projects that are very close to fruition.
4464 2018-06-20 15:12:53 Actually the unemployment rate is at 6.9% the lowest it’s been since August 2015. This governments plan all along was to slowly build the economy back as a diversified economy and its working. The days of $100 dollar oil are over.
4465 2018-06-20 15:12:50 I've had readers make my marshmallow buttercream with coconut oil, but I imagine it's a little tricky due to the super-sharp melting point at 76F.

4469 2018-06-20 15:12:08 Oil free tuh mostly skin care industry claim their skin care product to be oil free - utk orang yg kulit berminyak tapi sebenarnya oil is good, oil free skin care product dia strip out our natural moisture and left our skin feeling dehydrated

4472 2018-06-20 15:11:59 Ah yes. Oil field ? Lol my husband has traveled there many times.
4473 2018-06-20 15:11:37 So that’s why stock market closed in the RED for this year so far? Why oil prices are sky rocketing, why Americans STILL aren’t saving? Tell me another one.

4475 2018-06-20 15:11:30 There some tricks going on here. He’s clearly in better shape, but the height of the shorts and the sweat/oil make it look more intense. You can definitely shred like that if all you do is workout for 5 weeks though
4476 2018-06-20 15:11:30 I had such high hopes for the Bumble & Bumble Curl Anti-Humidity Gel/Oil but it's really not working with my hair. I either don't use a lot and it doesn't hold or I use more and it looks wet all day. Plus it really separates my curls. I miss the clumps.
4477 2018-06-20 15:11:25 I don't know the status of Slovakia, so I can't say. But I can look at Norway where the currency has always been overvalued, and it has made Norway more of a monoeconomy. There's a reason why Norway is so much more dependent on oil. Oil has skewed it that way over decades

4507 2018-06-20 15:09:06 Think of environmental inaction.The billions we give oil companies. Tax breaks that re-distribute $ upward. 
There r bigger outrages than our accommodating dusky skinned refugees.Resist racism & scapegoating-or at least stop pretending you always supported immigrants till now.
4508 2018-06-20 15:08:58 Exfoliate once a week to scrub off dead cells that make skin look dull. When skin is freshly exfoliated, lotion and oil are better absorbed.

4514 2018-06-20 15:08:42 Funny... I lived in a semi-rural setting in Mexico as a child, and this was an almost daily thing due to ticks/spiders/other small, warmth-loving little things. Mineral oil/cooking oil was always on hand.
4515 2018-06-20 15:08:40 You've let yourself down. Had this been done by a Middle Eastern, Asian or African regime the US would be calling a special meeting of the UN & threatening war, esp if their was oil there. They may be illegal immigrants, but that is no excuse for this form of inhumane treatment.
4516 2018-06-20 15:08:31 @NHSEngland should see this for all those who are now fighting for legalising cannibis oil as the only thing to use for epilepsy. @GOVUK should see this too. Many of benefit claimers with autoimmune illnesses could also benefit and save the government millions

4528 2018-06-20 15:07:30 Roasted vegetables. Low effort and delicious. Just put stuff in a tray, sprinkle salt and olive oil over it, roll it around with your hands, bake at 400F, shake about with a fork once or twice while they bake. Carrots, sweet/potatoes - 40 min. Asparagus, brussel sprouts - 20 min

4543 2018-06-20 15:06:23 Is it like an oil you just apply to your hair? My sister recommended this to me too but I haven’t bought it yet

4545 2018-06-20 15:06:18 why do liberals think suggesting someone is gay slur is an insult? i thought they were tolerant and open to all lifestyles.
4546 2018-06-20 15:06:15 Likewise... after pointing out oil doesn’t come from Afghanistan or Ireland!! Some just aren’t blessed with any form of intelligence
4547 2018-06-20 15:05:57 it's like oil prices. that thing you are looking for isn't as cheap as you think it is anymore.
4548 2018-06-20 15:05:52 We should invest heavily in agriculture and other non oil sectors. We need to invest in research institutes & processing industries for economic growth and development.
4549 2018-06-20 15:05:44 WARNING PROPGANDA!
There is no other revenue of Oil and Gas into Norway, than the revenue, included i Norway´s National Budget.
This budget is NOK 260 billion under water.
The trillon dollars are non existing, only figures on a piece of paper, controlled by Foreigners.
4550 2018-06-20 15:05:25 yes. we must stop oil/coal/gas without delay. And then plant more trees to fix carbon in the most effective way. Keep it fixed, bury the wood. The ice will melt but perhaps the climate will not run away. The only + best hope. Meanwhile use nuclear for energy + some solar/wind

4559 2018-06-20 15:04:46 Bleach, Sugar, Water, cooking Oil in gas tanks is not effective - at temperature gasoline is not dense enough to hold these. They all sink to the bottom of the tank. Buy a can of quicksteel or cement the gas cover CLOSED instead. It's easier, less invasive, and effective.
4560 2018-06-20 15:04:28 I can send him some Holy oil and Extreme oil. They treat the intestines first so he might have a fighting chance. The Holy oil of Christ is still a miracle and was the physical gift from God that Jesus wanted his disciples to give to the sick. And so I do. Amen.
4561 2018-06-20 15:04:25 You know when you get your oil changed, and the attendant pulls out your air filter to convince you to change it (it’s extra $$$)? The last time they did that my filter had a cigarette in it and I never laughed so hard.
4562 2018-06-20 15:04:25 OIL 1H some significant things happened during EiA volatility. A red doji candle with long top/bottom wicks "tagged 20MA support" then jetted higher. 200MA is now PIVOT & is accumulating below for strength higher. An ascending channel formed & confirm bottom trendline.

4696 2018-06-20 14:53:34 I’ve been opposed to most of our war efforts since 1991. KBR drilled sideways into iraq which is why Hussein invaded. Most of our wars have been about oil. Not terrorism. Just oil. 

Kosovo we needed to be there. 

Also, am veteran.
4697 2018-06-20 14:53:33 You just stated my point I have been making for years. It took a long time to create the petroleum sources we are using; not to mention how changes in specific gravity when heavy oil is replaced with (water I think) effect the tectonic plates.

4703 2018-06-20 14:53:02 It is only wrong to burn it, if you don't plant as many trees as you burn and wait for them to grow to original size. What you are basically saying is produce oil and burry it; why don't we just stop using oil then. Compensating civilization is not a long term solution...

4713 2018-06-20 14:51:42 Donald Trump has been a pseudo-celebrity, a real estate pirate, a nabob in a gilded penthouse, a bully, a misogynist, a huckster and a political snake oil peddler... but he was never "the moral leader of his country or the world".
4714 2018-06-20 14:51:42 I suspect the Nobel committee meant the office of POTUS because Donald Trump and morality go together like oil spills and holy water.

4741 2018-06-20 14:49:20 Algae is good - I hope it can scale up.  We need solutions like that because the remaining oil in the ground is more and more difficult (and expensive) to extract.  Oil is a finite resource, so we need a Plan B.  Oil has a lot of other drawbacks - Saudis have us over a barrel!

4749 2018-06-20 14:48:19 Latest data from the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate shows oil production is ~11% lower than their forecast. Why? Maintenance work & technical problems on some fields. This is yet another reminder that global oil supply is more sensitive than is given credit. BULLISH

4754 2018-06-20 14:47:46 The commercial production of cannabis oil, for use under medical prescription should be controllable. That said, addicts can still get hold of prescribed medication.

4816 2018-06-20 14:41:38 I tried that last year, its very nasty, but it didn't help to reduce or stop the secondaries, tried the cannabis oil as well, but i do eat a lot of curries that i make myself, using those very ingredients.  I have plenty of faith in keeping myself healthy and fit.
4817 2018-06-20 14:41:30 I hate when you go to get a simple oil change and they end up telling 5 other things that gotta be fixed

4840 2018-06-20 14:39:14 the big difference between ice cream and frozen dessert is this Frozen desserts are made with vegetable oil. Also, this is usually the vegetable oil that we want to avoid in our diet like coconut oil or palm oil. Ice-cream on the other hand, is mainly made from milk and dairy fat

4852 2018-06-20 14:38:13 I agree it had to be regulated and corruption has to be eliminated. However to say we cannot export resources is not write. If Middle east  countries say we wont export oil - the whole would will stop. Resources has to he imported/exported at the market price. We cant keep It all

4969 2018-06-20 14:29:14 I am aware that the medicinal facilities available in US include a smokeable cannabis option. But with reference to the UK government they are trying to implement new laws to resolve cases such as Billy Caldwell- cannabis oil (a fluid).

4980 2018-06-20 14:28:11 The US is self-sufficient in everything that counts these days, having cut out the lunacy of importing oil instead of drilling its own. You can't say that about the EU whose tough-talking is outranked by their weaknesses.
4981 2018-06-20 14:28:05 Pretty sure you produce the oil in your hair naturally. You know, what with you being immeasurably unctuous and evil.
4982 2018-06-20 14:28:04 last night i was hanging out in the bathroom of shoreditch house w sophie and she told me she wants to release four albums this year and that the first ever instagram comment she like was mine on the oil artwork so, that happened x

Another way China may hurt U.S. is by halting its purchases of oil (U.S. firms sell about 300K barrels a day to the PR). China is weighing a shift to American rivals, reports say
4990 2018-06-20 14:27:44 I reconcile the oil and water parts by enjoying healthy interactions with people like me. A wise woman once told me “don’t be too hard on yourself”. And viola, I became one person. Glad to hear you’re enjoying the stand up challenge!
4991 2018-06-20 14:27:43 @sajidjavid @theresa_may 115,000 of us are calling on you to legalise medicinal cannabis oil, promising a review is not enough. Public support is behind us, change this law and save lives! #MedicalCannabisNow
4992 2018-06-20 14:27:35 Oh please. The natural gas belongs to PA. Severance taxes will help protect PA environment when extractors trash our environment. Your purpose is profit, just like coal barons and oil barons,you'll get rich, jobs will be gone, pollution permanent.

4995 2018-06-20 14:27:05 @VinnieTortorich I am looking to start using MCT oil but since I am not a coffee drinker I was going to add it to tea instead. I assume if I keep to the same basic rules it will be as effective? Anything I need to avoid when looking at the different options?
4996 2018-06-20 14:27:02 Not sure if @pattidomm is trying too hard, trying to serve globalist and neocon masters at once. IN TRUTH, India and South Korea (partly) never joined #Iran #Sanctions and Iran oil hardly came offstream. China is NOT even a big buyer.

4998 2018-06-20 14:26:53 Green beans are delicious with basil and olive oil. I don't understand your class war. Also no one eats casseroles since 1975.
4999 2018-06-20 14:26:52 If #realDonaldTrump was truly concerned about his policy separating children from parents at the border he'd go there to see the trauma that he's wrought for these families. But alas, he'd rather sell his snake oil at a rally in Duluth, MN #WhereAreTheGirls

Or about every South American country the US fucked up because they wanted the oil and implemented the people they wanted to
5008 2018-06-20 14:26:27 rub you hands with some oil before chopping things like chilli and onion, when you wash your hands with soap after it will completely come off
5009 2018-06-20 14:26:24 Even if your doctor wont provide stufff with THC, the CBD oil from Holland Barretts will help somewhat. Hope you have success. If all else fails just buy a big old bag of weed and bake some brownies ;)

5011 2018-06-20 14:26:02 having dinner at @goldennuggetac last night, I was Serving  salad the cap of the olive oil comes off, it spilled all over my shorts and shirt. I'm assuming it was the fault of whoever is in charge of refilling the oil. I had to buy new clothes out of my pocket. Horrible experien.
5012 2018-06-20 14:26:00 We recommend cleaning the spring with warm soap and water. After that, we recommend putting food grade oil on it to help loosen it up. We hope this helps.
5013 2018-06-20 14:25:52 Are they kidding me children are  being ripped from their parents and their toting their tax cut I've seen no increase in my wages higher gas prices higher oil prices rising healthcare costs. What s scam

5019 2018-06-20 14:25:04 so you are comparing an oil producing city Dubai to green producing city Salem. do you think oil price equals to farm products? அவர்களிடம் இருக்கு கட்டுகிறான்... நாட்டுல கடன் பல கோடி வைச்சுகிட்டு... முடியல...

5033 2018-06-20 14:23:39 Trump, if you want to take care of much of this immigration problem, start threatening those countries in Central America to clean up the gang problems that cause them to flee or we will.  A military action that we could do that wouldn't involve oil for a change.
5034 2018-06-20 14:23:33 AM I seeing wrong? Aren't these #MenengaiOil trucks supposed to be transporting #Menengai products? What else have they been transporting before this was discovered? Where is @GovernorLeeKinyanjui @susankihika Menengai Oil Refineries should give explanations on this

President Trump is removing regulations that save worker's lives.
Example : After BP Gulf oil spill where workers died, new reg for blowout preventers added to save lives and spills.

Trump removed this regulation.
5058 2018-06-20 14:20:26 @cbdbrothers Hi I just got my first ever oil from you, the green version. I was surprised at its rather unpleasant taste which is smoky and bitter. I found only two drops under my tongue made my throat slightly sore. Is this normal? If so, how can it be easily masked.

Until oil Corps decided to destroy the country n created refugee.

5093 2018-06-20 14:16:51 Lets be real:  Republicans do not value human life, they market them selves as such.  Rs do not care about vets only having men to die for their oil fights, Rs do not care about the constitution flag or religion they just play on the values of those that do. #speaktruth
5094 2018-06-20 14:16:42 I love how smuggled shoes and clothing are enough to bait people into thinking that’s a worthy argument with trade in North America. 

Millions of tons worth of wood, oil and steel are being compared with some scuffed shoes. 

Seriously.

5099 2018-06-20 14:16:28 I am a problematic non-breakfast meal eater so I started drinking coffee with cacao, cayenne, cinnamon, and coconut oil - it’s delicious & I never have to apply lip balm.

5101 2018-06-20 14:16:13 Almost forgot to also mention Ortho Ease! A massage oil by Young Living with similar essential oils but diluted with carrier oil. Very effective as well when used regularly for joint and/or muscle pain.
5102 2018-06-20 14:16:12 This is EXACTLY what I said yesterday and EXACTLY what happened with ISIL in Iraq. The US Gov't (white savior/occupier) mentality. Their idea of imposing democracy on Iraqis after killing Saddam (over oil, truthfully) was the dumbest shit ever.

5121 2018-06-20 14:14:22 Yes it was premeditated by Jamal so he can come out with this premeditated statement. For your info, no one premeditates for cowards. Boo and you are off to some oil palm plantation.

5134 2018-06-20 14:12:41 Think my neighbour is either drilling thru bedrock for oil or demolishing his house brick-by-brick judging from the constant pneumatic drilling going on ALL DAY. How much concrete can one house have for heavens sakes?!

5162 2018-06-20 14:09:31 I just dropped my car off to get an oil change and figure out why the locks on the back doors have a mind of their own. Passenger door doesn’t lock and the drivers side won’t unlock unless you use the inside handle.

5178 2018-06-20 14:07:41 Q: The @OGAuthority is responsible for issuing licences (PEDLs) for oil & gas exploration and development. They are not an automatic right to drill, but an earmarked area of land reserved for that operator's exploration. But... how big do these licence blocks tend to be?

5195 2018-06-20 14:05:24 I remember  when PH -KD pipeline was in use. Some people in Benue state were able to drill into the pipeline to connect a tap from which they fetched oil products. Until we deregulate crude oil, any long distance pipeline is exposed to such illegal siphoning

5206 2018-06-20 14:04:11 They sell kasi yung oil control pads. Their advise was if your face feels dry or itchy or dirty, use the pads. 

Eh isang 30-pad set is like 3500 if I remember right. But your face feels dry pa rin talaga, so more more balik ka sa kanila for treatments.

Mas ok talaga sa Aivee.

5213 2018-06-20 14:03:44 Oil companies still have oil spills, however. Compliance equals security.
5214 2018-06-20 14:03:43 うふふふどうでしょう？(ღ˘⌣˘ღ)

5216 2018-06-20 14:03:39 #OOTT @GoldmanSachs Oil team call starting (badly) : "The picture is radically different than it was 3 weeks ago, 3 weeks ago it was very bullish" 
5217 2018-06-20 14:03:39 Everyone has an anti-trump bias. Nobody likes u Donald Same as we hated u in #NewYork when u pretended 2 be a top developer. It’s all bells & whistles Ur a phony, a con man, a snake oil salesman. Now the world knows. It’s coming to an end on youru will   be removed from office
5218 2018-06-20 14:03:34 All very legal with a Drs script which is easy to get. My Granny's club has their order in  for Cannabis Oil - just dipping in the toe. . . getting the plantings ready
5219 2018-06-20 14:03:31 ありがとうございます！
5220 2018-06-20 14:03:28 Yes China wants their oil and resources and not their culture
5221 2018-06-20 14:03:28 Reduce oil output.
Reduce by 1 million barrels.
@China
@Russia
@qatar

5222 2018-06-20 14:03:24 Just like the oil business and other pollution producing businesses have a responsiblity for the hazards they produce, businesses should realize that as soon as they deal with data, they have created a hazard. They should be responsible.
5223 2018-06-20 14:03:24 Iran clearly softening on their approach to OPEC production hikes. Iran oil minister will now attend, and they will consider a moderate output increase, with conditions #OOTT
5224 2018-06-20 14:03:23 Fully agree, which is what I emphasize.  I did run the correlation and correlation over past 60 days on percent a change is 0.40, which is near the median over the past several years.   I cited oil only because so many still see CAD as a petro-currency.
5225 2018-06-20 14:03:20 Yes! This oil is great for joint and/or muscle pain. Frankincense is also great for joints but more pricey.
5226 2018-06-20 14:03:00 Kalo aku sih waktu itu gradakan dikasih facewash selama 2 hari pagi malem langsung ilang,sama pas bedakan ternyata gradakannya masih ada aplg kek kulit ngelopek gitu jdnya aku kasihin almond oil:)
5227 2018-06-20 14:03:00 ตั้งแต่ดู #หนึ่งด้าวฟ้าเดียว มาเพิ่งจะมีวันนี้มะที่ได้ยินเพลงในเรื่องจนจบ หรือเคยมีแต่เราไม่รู้นะ
5228 2018-06-20 14:02:43 Neither side wants a solution. Why would you want to cure the disease when selling snake oil against it is your entire business model
5229 2018-06-20 14:02:39 Gago tambay tayo e. Hahahaha
5230 2018-06-20 14:02:13 2.5 hours for an oil change ? And still not through ? 
5231 2018-06-20 14:02:12 His whole scenario is just confusing. I try to search about Churchill reference about Royal Navy dependence on Arabian oil field as he mentioned and i found nothing
5232 2018-06-20 14:02:08 Agree with the Keto diet but what’s wrong with coconut oil? 
5233 2018-06-20 14:02:00 Bought a push mower last night for $20 because it "wouldn't run right" and he "wanted it out of the garage".  Got it home, pulled the dip stick and found twice as much oil as it needed.  So, I mowed my lawn with it last night...
5234 2018-06-20 14:01:57 "You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows." -Psalm 23:5 (NIV)
5235 2018-06-20 14:01:53 ほんとです。この友情に友情クリティカルはずるい。
5236 2018-06-20 14:01:45 it seems like you have very sensitive skin, so i’d recommend using a 5 blade razor and maybe try using olive oil instead of lotions or shaving creams and like really soak hairs in it before shaving (i know it sounds weird, but sometimes it helps)
5237 2018-06-20 14:01:34 Mata panda sedikit berkurang, bibir jd lembab tp balik kering lg kl ada jerawat mw tumbuh ak  pakein almond oil mlm nya trs bsknya g ada
5238 2018-06-20 14:01:30 It would be great! Texas has the 13 largest economy in the world. Oil and wind energy-Gulf ports. We have all we need and then some.
5239 2018-06-20 14:01:25 I use cbd oil for numerous ailments that leave me bed bound for much of the time,been prescribed ridiculous amounts of medication from gp 53 tablets + morphine every day,i have drastically reduced now as cbd oil more effective,search feel supreme on fb 4 info
5240 2018-06-20 14:01:03 Warning by @fordnation on weekend gasoline price hikes shows complete lack of understanding of supply and demand, the very basic laws of economics. With his anti-free market rhetoric, surely he is not suggesting nationalizing the province's oil and gas sector?!?
5241 2018-06-20 14:00:56 Every time I go to get my oil changed I feel like I’m doing it wrong? But maybe car technicians are all just awkward?
5242 2018-06-20 14:00:51 My car is at the point where every time I take it in for an oil change I brace myself to hear "I'm sorry, Mr. Westra, there's nothing we can do."
5243 2018-06-20 14:00:50 If you lived in Italy there'd be an Olive Oil shortage.
5244 2018-06-20 14:00:31 Paling okay ikut skintype and texture moisturizer jugak. So far pakai neutrogena oil free best and tak oily. Skintype; combi to oily.
5245 2018-06-20 14:00:29 The unfortunate thing is that a couple of years ago when oil prices were very low, there was (briefly) no subsidy .. could have removed formally as well
5246 2018-06-20 14:00:22 The bear chuckled, taking a bit of oil and pouring it directly into the dragoness’s rear, his paw softly caressing her pink skin to hydrate her. “Of course!” he said, growing a warm smile on his maw

5248 2018-06-20 14:00:05 Now go to the dispenser and give them the pearl and get the other measure of oil.
5249 2018-06-20 13:59:51 So #Russia's Novak wants a 1.5m bpd oil production uptick, #Iran & #Venezuela want to "veto" any output hike, Gulf producers want 300-600 kbpd hike; & #OPEC SecGen says there 'will be a deal' = crude kerfuffle coming on 22/23 June #OOTT #oilandgas
5250 2018-06-20 13:59:30 It's just sardines without oil and salad but it's very delicious You should try it. 
5251 2018-06-20 13:59:23 The big question now - does the oil live up to its name? Haha
5252 2018-06-20 13:59:19 Any body oil that has the name Amber in it always smells great
5253 2018-06-20 13:59:11 Re: veg oils, she said they don't use much oil but it's an olive/canola blend when they do.  Didn't elaborate on the sauces, but my assumption is they're Sysco and therefor laden with n-6.  Since we'll be packing the lunches, it's a moot point but confirmed my fears.

5256 2018-06-20 13:58:39 Oh my gosh this was so much better than the original. Oil in trailer park lololol 
5257 2018-06-20 13:58:34 For sure, say goodbye to EV and PHEV rebates of up to $14,000. It will be the condition from oil companies to lower gas by $0.10 per litre and Dougie needs to deliver on his promise regardless.
5258 2018-06-20 13:58:33 Oh btw, nobody believes that the electric cars will replace the oil demand

5262 2018-06-20 13:57:31 I stopped trying to refresh it by putting hair lotion on it. The key is to let the steam hit it in the shower and then hit it with some castor oil after you get out. Keep fluffing, thrive. ALSO having an even haircut makes aaaaall the difference.

5481 2018-06-20 13:31:45 Reminds me of the time we funded a coup in the Ukraine and Trump made his son and Sec of State head of the largest oil company in the country... wait a minute, that was Joe Biden and John Kerrys sons.. I'm sure Trump telepathically made this happen though.
5482 2018-06-20 13:31:42 Stop the cash flow, aide, Obama bribes, and PRESTO no more angry bad guys with in power. Iran peaceful by Christmas, it's just that easy. Obama never looked for a solution, that would cut off the Dem and RHINO slush fund. Iran is the #2 oil well in the world.

5484 2018-06-20 13:31:33 @drvox If that natural gas furnace vents through the chimney that the oil one used, get the chimney checked regularly. Condensation of gas exhaust plus fifty years of oil spot equals sulfuric acid and eventually carbon monoxide penetrating the corroded lining.

5552 2018-06-20 13:23:11 Many do seek asylum there. I would imagine some have family here, or they may also deem Mexico as not particularly safe either (cartels). The world has agreed to buy oil in US currency, and because we have that advantage, we are indeed literally the world’s keeper.
5553 2018-06-20 13:23:05 Any suggestions on the amount to use for one versus another? Should I use the same number of drops for one oil versus another (not together, obviously), or should I use more spearmint since it's "weaker" than peppermint?

5580 2018-06-20 13:20:22 No, but I think it's time for the oil companies themselves to start a solid, public PR campaign with rallies, advertising, op eds, iconic Cdns as spokespeople, billboards, public transit advertising, etc. Use the tactics that have been used against them by the eco-terrorists
5581 2018-06-20 13:20:12 And look at what's happening now with China putting 25% tariffs on U.S. oil,gas and coal.  China's markets will shift to other suppliers *cough* Iran *cough* and more of those markets will get traded in Yuan.  Thus weakening dollar diplomacy/hegemony
5582 2018-06-20 13:20:08 Cannabis oil is anti inflammatory for one thing!  And great in treating pain.    @mssocietyuk has lots of information....
5583 2018-06-20 13:20:07 Oil is stronger but make sure you get *Food Grade* (so no hexane...which is a nasty solvent) . Oil is also more flexible; you can use it in chocolate too without it changing the consistency. Extract is just cheaper from what I've read (literally oil dissolved in something)

5587 2018-06-20 13:19:38 CBD (cannabidiol) oil from cannabis often works best in several (3-4x) small daily doses. 

If you are experiencing a headache or fatigue from using CBD oil, try lowering your dose and increasing your frequency.

5742 2018-06-20 13:02:39 You know what I’ll just be at your house everyday & you can oil my edges.
5743 2018-06-20 13:02:31 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
5744 2018-06-20 13:02:31 Ahh thank you Katie, I will have a look.

5751 2018-06-20 13:01:42 It’s something to do with the fluid in the middle ear thickening as people get older. Or something.

5760 2018-06-20 13:00:45 Castor oil is thick so u might want to use lighter oils, I use castor oil when I’m mixing it with other oils for hot oil treatments, or the edges or sometimes I use it alone but that’s usually in the winter time. Al ittle goes a long way since castor oil is very thick.

5842 2018-06-20 12:51:43 I expect production increase from #OPEC+ (even if outside coalition). This would push oil prices initially lower. From there, #oil prices should rally into the ~$90 range well into 2019. New US pipeline capacity coming online should help prices to fall back below USD70 eventually

5852 2018-06-20 12:50:12 fracking combined with "horizontal" drilling has fundamentally changed the oil and gas exploration and production industry, making untold accumulations of oil and gas economically available now and in the future....and that is good for all of humanity.

Currently there are about 115,000 ATMs connected on VSATs, which number is likely to grow to around 200,000 in the next 4 years.

Govt.’s mandate to automate and connect oil retail outlets by March 2019 is creating large volume opportunities for VSATs

6058 2018-06-20 12:27:06 It’s still not illegal. Those are their own countries. Exxon or US oil countries can’t join OPEC as they fall under US anti trust laws, but other countries have their own laws.

6061 2018-06-20 12:26:45 Right to Try was a successful attempt at diminishing the FDA's ability to prevent the sale of snake oil that can't produce results in a clinical trial. Only someone unfamiliar with the biopharma industry would believe the "access" message used to promote the bill.

6182 2018-06-20 12:08:43 I didn't quite say that.  I said that small businesses still trust the small accounting and auditing practices and that this trust, and the oil it puts into the machinery of commerce, should not be forgotten.  There is clearly a loss of trust in big business and their auditors.

6250 2018-06-20 11:57:27 Unfortunately Trudeau isn't doing much better, despite his talk. Libs just approved a major oil pipeline, they still give out bottling permits, and the carbon tax plan will come nowhere close to helping us hit our Paris commitments. I guess the gov just doesn't care?

6252 2018-06-20 11:57:19 Asia's 180-cst fuel oil crack at a discount of $5.41 a barrel on Wednesday reflected the narrowest discount in two weeks as stronger fundamentals could have countered the high oil prices which typically weighs on oil products margins.

6269 2018-06-20 11:54:42 The petro-statists are doing as they have been told, force the maximum need for oil, force the profit up, take the taxes off, abandon other energy, reduce pollution laws, end clean-up enforcement, the world over.

6277 2018-06-20 11:52:58 @loosewomen just wanted to say about the cannabis legalization discussion the strain that Billy needs does contain thc which if used correctly it has major benefits it's when people take to much that the issue occurs as you can legally get cbd oil in UK at moment

6280 2018-06-20 11:52:32 It's really interesting. It seems the trick is to teach your face to balance oil production, instead of controlling it. I only wash my face once a day, tone with an ACV toner and take off makeup with oil/cream. It sounds counterproductive but has worked very well for me
6281 2018-06-20 11:52:27 The BP energy outlook projects a RISE in oil demand in the next 20 years. Who are these amateurs writing articles for you guys? Can I get a shot as well?
6282 2018-06-20 11:52:27 They're FAKE and want to be Christians-- most of them refuse to see and hear what their dictator illegitimate MOB President Trump is doing. They voted for him and now saying "God sent him" and "God will protect him", they had too much of Trump's snake oil.
  God will remove him.

6345 2018-06-20 11:44:02 You could prolly jam it down into the oil too. My guess is with the heat and speed, it'll prolly do some damage there too. (Tho, if you want to break a car using oil, you just drain it and hope they're too lazy/complacent to notice.)

6376 2018-06-20 11:39:30 Give me some. I tried onions but I hated the smell (which lingered for like a week). I usually massage with coconut oil before showering.
6377 2018-06-20 11:39:22 Seriously. I think it's because a few Greeks were passing off sunflower oil with food colouring in it as olive oil. EU law now says olive oil has to be sold in sealed containers to guarantee quality. My local low-packaging shop would love to sell it in reusable bottles but can't.
6378 2018-06-20 11:39:18 Look I would love a lower rate like the Chrome guys who get 6c per KWh..but in food processing a 24-hour power cut every week can put you out of business. As it is we want to lower costs so we can be at par with SA cooking oil & silence critics but we can’t due to high costs.

6384 2018-06-20 11:38:59 Berry your wipes might be contributing to the oiliness. Apparently a mistake us oily skin types make is try too hard to eliminate oil, which causes skin to overproduce to compensate. Might be worth it to explore using blotting paper and see if you record any changes
6385 2018-06-20 11:38:55 It's easier to just wait for the oil to run out. Then it'll be bikes only.
6386 2018-06-20 11:38:53 Disagree. Cobalt will come online (With lithium) and drive prices down. Proven Tech without is a long way away. We've looked at VRBs in oil and gas installations and is unsuitable however other industries prob fine. Uranium has a bright outlook, but sometime off.

6413 2018-06-20 11:33:50 If Only source of income for infrastructure development or national building is Oil, Why we are taking measures to reduce oil consumption and increase the production of electric vehicles.

So we are running on taxes collected from common man that are paid through oil.

6414 2018-06-20 11:33:46 I adapted my diet and removed red meat, dairy, gluten and caffeine. My diet is mostly leafy greens, fish, eggs and lean white meat 3 times a week.

6416 2018-06-20 11:32:58 Oil prices declined after we installed geothermal snd our electric bill increased here in Ontario over that same period. So our payback has been pushed out 5 or 6 years.  But we're happy with the decision.  And I sold my oil tank, half full, for $750  :-)
6417 2018-06-20 11:32:53 Oil up on US stocks, Libya ahead of OPEC meeting on Wednesday

-Oil prices rose on Wednesday, supported by a drop in U.S. commercial crude inventories and the loss of storage capacity in Libya.

6422 2018-06-20 11:32:02 The strongest argument for #Brexit I've heard is that it will let us go back to selling olive oil on-tap. Not sure that outweighs the loss of rights, loss of jobs, loss of economic activity, and the possible break-up of the Union, but it's something. #swingsandroundabouts

6453 2018-06-20 11:27:31 Unfortunately it seems that to get the oil on prescription you need smart, erudite parents and spokespeople.
Good luck to them and well done but let's open this up to everyone who needs it.

6462 2018-06-20 11:26:20 Our choice was to replace it with oil, wood or propane - natural gas was not available in the country. There was a gov't rebate for geothermal (up to $10K) so I got quotes. All were around $30K - about 6 times the cost of alternatives.

Seriously though, letting any water in while mud plugging is really bad because the muds stays in. I have 3/4” BSPT bungs in the rails so I can load gear oil in there. It just didn’t get this far forward :o(
But it will ! :o)
6496 2018-06-20 11:21:30 Anyway, since you are already there, when making the sweet potato mash, dont add the normal Irish potatoes. Just add 1-2 cloves of minced garlic, some little oil and some milk when mashing until it's light and fluffy.

6511 2018-06-20 11:19:32 Venezuela had higher levels of poverty before socialism. Indentured by the U.S. corporations who exploited the oil
6512 2018-06-20 11:19:22 I didn’t write to close off the gas and oil industries. Where did I write that? Look at countries like Denmark and Sweden who are prosperous, making their existing economies and cities greener. Going forward not backward.

6568 2018-06-20 11:11:50 Have to ask , when did UKGOV sell these licences to frack in Scotland - because onshore oil and gas is NOW a ScotGov remit.

So if ScotGov were concerned about income and fracking from that power , it would have done so enriching the few.

Even the Clyde is classed as onshore.

6586 2018-06-20 11:09:00 why thank you! here’s the recipe: sauté garlic & olive oil in a pan,add cherry tomatoes sliced in half & fresh asparagus cut into fourths. Add s&p. Sauté until both vegetables are soft, boil ravioli until it’s al dente.Add together-use some of the pasta water so it’s not so dry

6595 2018-06-20 11:07:37 You have my total support.

Just as soon as all those Indigenous Peoples & pseudo-protestors stop depending upon 'the oil industry' for their modern way of life.
6596 2018-06-20 11:07:35 When oil is done and there is no other thing to do with Scotland say like being a nuclear generating , processing, trident berth, and dump post Holyrood, only then will "barnet" income be on the English radar.

And thats when Scots Indy will be demanded , and not by the Scots.

6684 2018-06-20 10:52:23 Scheer is proving himself to be a sell-out and honestly more of the same. He and JT both support SCM, both have yet to condemn Trump for the youth detentions and both are in favor of big oil. If you're so against Scheer, what do u think about JT and his stances on these issues?

6689 2018-06-20 10:51:50 No, we can withstand Iran not selling their oil in the dollar. But the value of the US dollar is derived from the petro dollar. Any unscheduled deviance from this will result in the US deploying troops. The fed (Rothschilds) backed the US into a corner foreign affairs wise.

6944 2018-06-20 10:18:07 Yes electric vehicles will not require oil as the batteries of these cars use lithium. Currently, China is the biggest supplier of lithium and new mines have been found in Zambia and other African countries.  Be hopeful.

6956 2018-06-20 10:15:18 not good policy, as it may delay, but will only exacerbate, inevitable supply shock. US refiners already maxed out on LTO, will US release ~ 15% of SPR just to have it exported?  Economic reality of oil can't be avoided; it's an inconvenient truth many may learn the hard way.

6964 2018-06-20 10:14:00 My point was if we need a strong currency we get one via policy.  If oil crashes again, the BoC has tools to move it against the flow of oil.  Of course the CAD moves with oil!! But it doesn't have to.  That is my point.

6966 2018-06-20 10:13:51 .@GFCEconomics’ Graham Turner: UK, excl oil exports, had a record trade imbalance this April. Reflects lack of investment.
6967 2018-06-20 10:13:44 Use relaxers with lye in it. If it’s not relaxing it probably means the box ones are too mild. Use the ones that don’t have a box. Organic is okay but try the olive oil and shea butter ones too.
6968 2018-06-20 10:13:34 #oott if more US us shale oil will be able to be exported relatively soon .. shouldn't opec / russia be trying to support prices until then .. raising production and then more shale doesn't make sense

7090 2018-06-20 09:55:58 The discount should be big enough to bring oil below $40-45/bbl and force players to stop to growth in the short term. Discount could be higher

EIA shows the API of crude oil into refineries was 32.55 in Feb. This was the highest level since March 1986. For every 1 degree of API increase is a ~1mbpd change in the light/heavy blend i.e. +0.5mbpd light/-0.5mbpd heavy. This is not small

7497 2018-06-20 08:56:07 Actually for most people the tax cuts are being canceled by the increase in oil prices and the tariff war.

The overheating of the economy causes inflation (prices going up) up which offsets the tax cuts.

Furthermore the huge deficit will have to be refunded later... good luck!

7605 2018-06-20 08:40:33 So guess what? I ditched the steroid cream the dr gave me for castor oil and coconut oil. It’s day 2 and the flare up has just about disappeared without scarring, feel like I just discovered a hidden secret

7612 2018-06-20 08:39:55 I actually had alot of respect for Elon before he tried to insinuate that the "oil and gas" companies may have been involved. 

The first sign of problems is adopting rediculous conspiracy theories just to suit your ideas. He must be hanging out with craptocurrency hodlers lol
7613 2018-06-20 08:39:47 Make no mistake it's the same as the big oil companies sitting on green technology until it suits. Tories and big pharma will find a way of making sure only officially licensed products are legal.

7615 2018-06-20 08:39:06 It was the petrochemical industry that was instrumental in making Cannings illegal. An oil tycoon's nephew was in the US government body that brought the motion forward & made it illegal. And now we have plastics & a looming ecological disaster.
7616 2018-06-20 08:38:58 No thanks, Owen. It’s bad enough when it’s legal having to shut all the windows because our unsavoury neighbours are having a joint. Nothing against oil for medical reasons.
7617 2018-06-20 08:38:53 @VictoriaLIVE You stated that Britain is the biggest exporter of Cannabis oil But you fail to mention The Prime Ministers Husband is the majority investor in the company that has the licence to grow Skunk Weed to convert to oil?

7620 2018-06-20 08:38:44 @Ijaw_girl Said the oil companies are also maintaining pipelines this time, so no "pressure"
7621 2018-06-20 08:38:39 I gave up smoking in 1992 when working at a quarry mixing a batch of ANFO ( ammonium nitrate and fuel oil- an explosive) when I suddenly realised I had lit a cigarette.... never smoked since
7622 2018-06-20 08:38:32 @jonathanhealy Ah come on,  you can't expect us to believe a spokesperson for the oil industry? It's like having the owner of a fag company telling us smoking does no harm.

7634 2018-06-20 08:36:33 Fact of the matter is Central & State Govts should stop depending on taxes on oil & make mandatory use of alternative energy.

7637 2018-06-20 08:35:52 I don't know what they're doing with it then because Norway's share of world oil revenues are x10 more than UK's. So given that Norway has just over 5 million people & the UK has almost 66 million & rising it's no wonder Norway have such a great balance sheet & benefits system.

7665 2018-06-20 08:30:23 Illegally? Nothing they are doing is illegal. And if you hadn’t noticed, most OPEC countries are seeing massive declines in production, that isn’t voluntary it’s from lack of investment the last 3 years due to low oil prices.

7685 2018-06-20 08:27:00 I think even under capitalism renewables will take over. Solar is the way to go its already cheaper than nuclear and as oil/gas reserves drop will become cheaper than those too. Not so sure wind power has the ability as solar to become cheaper overtime.

7873 2018-06-20 07:58:37 That tap water you can light on fire in some parts of the US must be purely coincidental. And even if we were to grant that it doesn't massively pollute the environment (which it does), it's still energy inefficient and only profitable if oil prices are high.
7874 2018-06-20 07:58:13 European stocks open higher amid rising trade war fears. OPEC ministers were seen gathering in Vienna ahead of a key summit to decide oil production policy on Friday

7877 2018-06-20 07:57:32 In these days of online marketing, you can purchase "Sattu" online. Further, this litti (Baati) can be fried also in Refine Oil like Samosa, but that baked in Oven or on a Chulha (i.e. सेंकना) is much healthier. Will you try it?

7919 2018-06-20 07:48:16 Right, the Iraqi war was over the fact that saddam Hussein decided to sell his oil in euros rather then the American dollar. That would literally implode the US economy and you’d probably be dead by starvation. That’s the WMD he had, it was that power over our economy.

8028 2018-06-20 07:23:57 We're not advocating SMOKING!  Cannabis is a medicine to we sufferes. I went from struggling to walk with a seated trolly to dancing for three hours the day after using CBD oil on February 6th this year. Cronic arthritis is now pain free and I feel 'normal' again 
8029 2018-06-20 07:23:56 That's because the USA only imports finished goods.

We export only raw materials and now oil. (thanks to Obama changing that rule to allow the continued extraction of America.)

8139 2018-06-20 07:02:37 Clear positive evidence for medical use of cannabis oil. Yes. But I worry fully egalising general use would encourage more smoking of it mixed with tobacco, smoking is a killer and young people see it as cool to smoke it. So cannabis oil for medical purposes only.

8144 2018-06-20 07:01:55 @NickFerrariLBC I wonder if anyone has looked at how many people and what conditions could benefit from medical cannabis? We understand that it can help with dystonia - painful cramping that is a symptom of young onset Parkinson’s. #oil

8152 2018-06-20 07:00:51 I read a real scientific paper once that discussed the effect of anointing oneself with cannabis oil. These *wise men from the bible" were off their tits kind of high. No wonder they saw angels and stuff.

Legalise  it now.
8162 2018-06-20 06:59:12 Yeah it happened to me on my top lip!! Apparently it was to do with the way the woman pulled the strips off! I put tea tree oil on afterwards and it slightly soothes it x

8165 2018-06-20 06:58:57 His solid cabinet makes me believe he won’t be as disruptive as the mrkt believes. His initiatives are questionable. Fighting corruption to finance refiners or subsidize oil and food prices, sounds like a loosing plan. Keeping macro policies broadly on track will be good outcome
8166 2018-06-20 06:58:50 I think they should decriminalise it completely, gets rid of low-life crims, frees up police time, make a shed load of tax on it, sell it only in Dutch style over-21 regulated coffee shops. If cannabis oil / derivatives can be used to ease pain then why not?

8182 2018-06-20 06:56:42 @renoomokri.The price of crude oil has dropped since APC took over so it is expected that the landing cost, selling price and by extension the subsidy per litre should be reduced.

8240 2018-06-20 06:47:09 my biggest tip would be to create an entire piece without blending, use solid blocks of color and hard edges, and only after its finished blend... i had the same tip for painting in oil paint, and it really works :)
8241 2018-06-20 06:46:31 It's ok.... I'm still practicing oil painting, I really need to improve on this, there is a lot of things that I have to learn. I haven't done watercolours but I guess they look so different from oils, well I guess it depends on the skin tones you use.... and thank you 
8242 2018-06-20 06:46:25 I agree, Mr Morgan pressed the lady  with whats worse booze or cannabis but what about Skunk cannabis which the NHS has stated  has a major impact and connection with mental health and mental health issues. its different using cannabis oil for medicine
8243 2018-06-20 06:46:20 @gmb my wife tried to get on cannabis trial for cancer at Leeds NHS but it was too late. Albeit they were trialling a synthetic form.

8253 2018-06-20 06:44:29 no offense but veganism literally reverses acne don’t @ me. unless y’all b eating a bunch of processed shit or oil

8255 2018-06-20 06:44:09 @piersmorgan # legaliseit that woman is so so wrong .Cannabis oil  stops tumors . Weed is no more dangerous than booze or fags .The gov need to follow Canada on this one.
8256 2018-06-20 06:44:02 I woke up and went to get a glass of water and somehow I now have prussian blue and alizarin crimson on my hands.
I am forever stained by oil paints at this point, it feels like.

oh boy...'
8259 2018-06-20 06:43:40 Jackie Graham - loved your topic on legalisation of cannabis for medicinal use. My husband has Parkinson’s for which no prescribed drugs have an effect. We would love to try cannabis oil. There is not only epilepsy this will help. The sooner this is legalised the better.
8260 2018-06-20 06:43:40 No I don’t
There’s been much research on cannabis
This should be taught in schools 
Anything can be dangerous in the wrong hands 
Cannabis oil should be provided on nhs it will save millions of £s and help millions of sufferers 
Don’t get the 2 mixed up
8261 2018-06-20 06:43:31 If cannabis oil can help epilepsy suffers then it should be made available
8262 2018-06-20 06:43:28 Wasn't just the oil industry though was it. Include the financial too for starters.. car industry.. elites..

8264 2018-06-20 06:43:26 Stoned, Moffed, qunyiwe, blazed, blood Clutt  high, probably had some cannabis oil, roffies, mushrooms,crack, cocaine and a lot of alcohol with it or his just plan stupid.... Haven't laughed so much moer

8266 2018-06-20 06:43:04 @GMB why can’t cannabis oil for medical use by prescription be legalised but not cannabis per se @piersmorgan seems to be lumping it all as one?

8284 2018-06-20 06:40:03 @GMB I have been using CBD oil for almost a year and have cut my morphine intake down by 3/4 since doing so, I'm sure using CBD oil could potentially save the NHS a lot of money from not needing as much pain relief and other medication.
8285 2018-06-20 06:39:54 พร้อมบวกก เมื่อไหร่ว่ามาข่ะ!!
8286 2018-06-20 06:39:44 @GMB I smoked tobbaco for 40 years and tried giving up several times, I used cannabis oil in a vape and gave up smoking easily, i still don't smoke and I did not get addicted to the cannabis oil. I think it should be legalised for medicinal purposes.
8287 2018-06-20 06:39:42 Minola nga lang. Canola oil lang mumsh
8288 2018-06-20 06:39:40 I have a severely disabled son with drug and diet resistant epilepsy. Up to 200 seizures a day and life threatening. I’d give him cannabis oil, watching him suffer is heartbreaking
8289 2018-06-20 06:39:35 It's been brought to my attention that I missed the article discusses a few people tweeting about beard oil to make me embarrassed to be a Queenslander but the news we have really well-organised covert dog-fighting rings has done it
8290 2018-06-20 06:39:30 That's CBD oil - not quite the same thing,  no THC in it.
8291 2018-06-20 06:39:10 Oh please. Capitalism is killing us, not socialism. It's the prime culprit with Venezuela too. OIL PRICES killed their economy. Prices controlled by MARKET FORCES & manipulated by oil producers. CAPITALISM. Cronyism & incompetence were the next biggest contributors.

8299 2018-06-20 06:38:11 Owh i tak pernah try la pulak. But any oil should be fine. 
8300 2018-06-20 06:37:58 @piersmorgan @GMB cannabis is a natural substance and the oil is completely different to the street drug where all kinds of chemicals have been added. Tobacco and alcohol have absolutely no health benefits. How can these be debated together ???
8301 2018-06-20 06:37:51 Olive oil ang gamit 
8302 2018-06-20 06:37:37 @piersmorgan is spot on for a change @GMB  alcohol and smoking is so much worse for you than cannabis oil.
8303 2018-06-20 06:37:31 Boil any kind of pasta, rinse it w cold water to cool, add feta and some kind of Italian salad dressing (or oil & vinegar + pepper works too) it’s so bomb. Add anything else you want like, I.e. bell peppers, carrots, etc

8314 2018-06-20 06:35:47 is it oil or water based?
8315 2018-06-20 06:35:24 The UN sent people to Standing Rock. And to much of the world's protest, it continued. It's not the UN that was wrong, it was the White House administration who refused to listen. And the pipeline was built,  and it leaked oil three times already.
8316 2018-06-20 06:35:21 @piersmorgan @susannareid100 you should look at Irish lady Vera Twoomey who has fought for this oil and had to take her child to a EU country to get this and was arrested on way back into Ireland.amazing story

8321 2018-06-20 06:35:02 I fully endorse cannabis for medicinal - it's a natural plant. opiates make me terribly ill so much so that I can't function. However cannabis oil even without the THC has made a huge difference in terms my pain.  @piersmorgan is absolutely right on tobacco and alcohol.
8322 2018-06-20 06:34:48 What are you on about now? You can't get legal cannabis oil in the UK with THC in it, so she had to bring it in from a foreign country. Your logic really does defy any human reasoning. #MadBint
8323 2018-06-20 06:34:45 @GMB I suffer from a chronic pain illness and it’s been proven that cannabis oil works for the pain! So I’m definitely for legalising cannabis oil

8347 2018-06-20 06:30:21 @piersmorgan talking to @DeirdreBoyd who says she is only supportive of approved NHRA medicines - yet how many people are “hooked” on the same. Opiates that are prescribed freely to mask pain, yet CBD oil can release the anguish of epilepsy as well as anxiety etc. #legalise #cbd
8348 2018-06-20 06:30:15 Acetaminophen in most pain killers can cause "Liver Damage" if taken for long duration! Some people are popping pain killers like candy!

8349 2018-06-20 06:29:43 @piersmorgan my daughter is undergoing tests for brain surgery as current drugs aren’t stopping her life threatening seizures.  Surely cannabis oil can’t be more of a risk than that!  Our kids needs help, we’re desperate.

8380 2018-06-20 06:22:21 Not really. She sells CBD oil which can't get you high but has other benefits. Her son needs the THC component of cannabis: THC is psychoactive and still illegal here, so that's why it was only allowed as a medical emergency.

8389 2018-06-20 06:19:32 Yep, trying to make their last buck out of it before EVs take over completely..the lies the Librats told when prices went sky high under ALP tho..totally ignored the international forces at play then and let the oil co's get away with murder now, despite the rhetoric back then.
8390 2018-06-20 06:19:31 Sarah I haven’t forgotten you pushed for the USA to drill@for oil. I guess you tired the old bastard is still alive. I don’t want to distory him on media. But he never dies. I think I will go before him 100 percent disabled Vietnam
8391 2018-06-20 06:19:16 I got to know some where on Internet that China is eying Venezuela oil reserves. Is it true? To my opinion it will be problematic for oil market
8392 2018-06-20 06:19:12 Btw, I am sure Senegal don't have CRUDE OIL and other RESOURCES we proudly boast of.. So how do you defend that? Please I urge you to leave the shadows of mediocrity, if you can't, don't infect others with it.

8396 2018-06-20 06:18:51 @LBC with reference to cannabis oil I’m a severe migraine sufferer and it works wonderful, I would never use cannabis
8397 2018-06-20 06:18:35 human rights, yeah right! but you don't have any trouble trading with china and buying venezuela's oil, huh? lies, lies, lies.
8398 2018-06-20 06:18:19 Not the same products, she sells CBD oil which is legal in Britain he needs the THC element in the oil which is illegal, this gets you high. I do feel she should have told people as it's so very confusing the differences, however, it doesn't change anything.
8399 2018-06-20 06:18:01 I better have mf pegasus wings for lashes after just stabbing my eye with castor oil on a stick  #uff
8400 2018-06-20 06:17:52 @NickFerrariLBC @lbc Nick that guy you just had on talking about Cannabis Oil....is he sponsored by a pharmaceutical company 
8401 2018-06-20 06:17:40 I buy oil in bulk (2l / 8gal) at a time so I put them in old beer bottles w/ those bar pourers. God h’aint punished me yet. But look, love to chat but gotta call a plumber - heck’ve-a mess of blood n locusts n frogs comin outta my faucets rn - weird huh?!
8402 2018-06-20 06:17:39 Thanks, Louise.  I'm trying everything, including CBD oil (thankfully, legal in California)  Big lifestyle changes too.
8403 2018-06-20 06:17:05 The fact that you're still chanting "Lock her up!" while shilling your snake oil products while families are separated at the border reveals your (lack of) character. I hope the lizard people eat your brain.

8405 2018-06-20 06:16:51 PSA: for those who burn like I do or choose tanning oil or sunscreen let me pyo. Use about 6 earl grey tea bags and hot water. Soak a towel in it until cool. Cover yourself in the towel for 30 mins. Will take away the pain. 
8406 2018-06-20 06:16:22 It's all very well allowing cannabis oil to be taken.... But it's making my Rizla papers wet and a struggle to light up #bbcbreakfast
8407 2018-06-20 06:16:17 No. Her oil is only CBD which has no psychoactive effects: her son needs THC which does and is still illegal (this is what he was given as a medical emergency).
8408 2018-06-20 06:15:06 Oil producing states don't even get that percentage for producing all the oil these people are swallowing like yam.

8414 2018-06-20 06:13:43 $ETE on the #ASX probably the best junior oil play going around. Haven’t seen value like this in years. Completely written off by the market. Just read some of the comments on hotcoppper, suggesting it has zero hope. You got to love a bargain!

8422 2018-06-20 06:12:32 What's the diff Rhun? Billy Caldwell's oil contains THC which is the important component. Do you know how differs? Thank you.
8423 2018-06-20 06:12:06 The margin between the wholesale price and retail is widening too.  Traditionally it has always been around 5/6c a litre, now it's over 10c.  In 2008 crude oil was double what it is now and we paid 20c less a litre for petrol.  We are being ripped off.
8424 2018-06-20 06:11:50 I have fallen down a rabbit hole & are watching these fundamental christian moms talk about natural remedies & not wanting to give their kids antibiotics prescribed so they give them like coconut oil tanlets & I just. The fucking medical regression shit is INSANE

8427 2018-06-20 06:11:37 I also think that this is the key. Russia vs China, which country will get more access to SK.
Furthermore oil access to SK means Russians may increase defense forces in Vladivostok, and China will find another and much rougher player in the China sea

8446 2018-06-20 06:07:02 @knfilters I see your motorcycle oil filters are made in China. Will not be buying any and local bike shop has stopped selling  them due to quality concerns. Please don't tell me you intend to move other filter manufacturing to China! Not happy!
8447 2018-06-20 06:06:49 Is it the tripling of oil price and production increases and new discoveries?

8453 2018-06-20 06:05:59 If this were happening in any other oil producing nation of the world, America would have had us sanctioning the shit out of them by now.

Am totally ignorant about vaping btw, have only tried it once.

8522 2018-06-20 05:48:22 Engine oil and creamed corn for dessert tonight
8523 2018-06-20 05:47:41 I was at same NYSC where a northern guy was telling us that they will not allow the country to split not until they finish the crude oil first,that we enjoy there groundnut pyramid. I was like whoa !really. Cognitive dissonance is 1 problem of North.
8524 2018-06-20 05:47:37 Yes, hospitals is a necessity to try to fix cancer and other diseases caused by pollution from their oil. Then they earn big bucks selling medicine to "cure" it. 
It's not charity, it's investment.
8525 2018-06-20 05:47:34 @stopinvasion1 That is why you will never see another muslim in the white house> when obama took the oath on the bible, don't no how true it is that he took it again in the wh on a coran! were a nation of christian laws,oil & vinegar don't mix, were one nation under god,
8526 2018-06-20 05:47:33 They pretend to value democracy when behind the scene and sometimes openly supply arms to the killer leaders.  All that is happening in these countries,  some country in the west is behind it to divert our attention as they steal our oil and other valuable minarals.
8527 2018-06-20 05:47:06 I have a dirty mind for someone who's basically extra virgin olive oil
8528 2018-06-20 05:46:57 That will never be on the chopping block. Not unless oil goes to $5.
8529 2018-06-20 05:46:51 More, more oil for U.S!!!! To be super first!

8533 2018-06-20 05:45:56 @Shell_Nigeria @shell Odimodi  community is yet to receive medical relief from SPDC months after oil Spill.
8534 2018-06-20 05:45:50 My sister asked me if I could teach her how to do an oil change she’s 15, I wonder who’s she’s trying to impress lmaooo
8535 2018-06-20 05:45:35 I could cry rn, my dad took my car for an oil change and wow he didn’t need to do that but he did

8538 2018-06-20 05:44:47 Today in 1977 the first oil enters Trans-Alaska pipeline and exits 38 days later at Valdez
8539 2018-06-20 05:44:45 Thank you! Well oil painting is a little bit hard but if you have a little bit of knowledge about it or you can found a few basic tips it's actually kinda easy, I guess it's easier than acrylics  but yes you should try it somedayn it's really fun tho 
8540 2018-06-20 05:44:38 just tried oil. not great.
8541 2018-06-20 05:44:35 It's a death cycle. If oil would be more valuable than nature, they would never let even a drop flow into nature. But by making nature scarce, oil becomes worthless and nature even more oily.
8542 2018-06-20 05:44:25 SOPHIE's 'Oil...' album is incredible and introduced me to Mozart's Sister who provided most of the album's gorgeous vocals. Listening to their album 'Field Of Love' and it's reminding me of some of my favorites things... Utada's Exodus and Yoko Kanno's GITS SAC OST come to mind.
8543 2018-06-20 05:44:16 Ok, so currently we have beef, cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions, oregano, oil and vinegar. What two things to we add to make the turducken?

8546 2018-06-20 05:43:10 You answered your first question, it cures cancer. 

A) What is pharma going to do when everyone is healthy?

B) cannabis was made illegal due to hemp. Oil, forest & cotton industries didn't want to lose money. Since then other industries have jumped on board like liquor
8547 2018-06-20 05:42:54 Bro, could you please make a YouTube video on how coolant gets contaminated or mixed with oil in detail as per my case. 

PS: service center bastards saying, this is absolutely normal. Unhappy :(
8548 2018-06-20 05:42:44 I’ve fasted for thirty hours. You really learn a lot about yourself, like how much you want a fruity pebbled covered glazed donut wrapped in bacon and then deep fried in Oreo Oil.

8555 2018-06-20 05:41:44 The Q experts ask in private is did the Gujarat company have any oil/gas assets that needed merging or ONGC merely covered up a dud operation on which a fortune was wasted.
8556 2018-06-20 05:41:32 LOL! Someone who retweets and believes a 4chan soothsayer is calling into question other people's intelligence! That is rich, not to mention you seek a lead tainted snake oil salesman and performance artist as an arbiter of intelligence and information. I have seen it all. #MAGAt
8557 2018-06-20 05:41:21 don't forget to highly tax oil companies, and companies that use robots that take away humans jobs!

8559 2018-06-20 05:40:43 oh the dyson one actually doesn’t fuck your hair up. i usually put hair oil before blow drying my hair but didn’t have to for the dyson one. it’s just, the price point

8565 2018-06-20 05:40:14 Mini Adam Levine was trapped in a  rubber band but was saved by a chemist wearing chili pepper covered in Mustard oil who was sadly eaten by a empty Gadwall who had a third shoulder made of lutetium
8566 2018-06-20 05:40:10 This is all wrong. Y’all need to wake up. Trump, the ultimate snake oil conman is gaming is! We are letting it happen. Hell no !

8568 2018-06-20 05:40:05 I don’t understand how people can’t allow for a happy medium. Just because a person advocates reducing greenhouse gases in an effort to combat climate change does not inherently mean they are anti-pipelines, oil sands, etc. Is there no allowance for finding a balance.
8569 2018-06-20 05:40:05 So oil sands production is not something to worry about?
8570 2018-06-20 05:39:54 Oh, sorry. I confused you with the essential oil people.
8571 2018-06-20 05:39:49 According to latest research artificial intelligence is being used maximum in telecom sector followed by banking/ insurance and oil and gas.
8572 2018-06-20 05:39:47 It's also been shoring up oil/gas reserves in Africa and, in some cases, paying for those rights with army materiel.

8575 2018-06-20 05:39:22 How can you say govt paid for oil brought by private and govt refineries ?
They (Reliance,Essar,IOC) all are powerful companies and they used to pay for their purchase.

What govt does is either subsidise (during UPA) or Taxing oil (during NDA)

8581 2018-06-20 05:37:56 Correct, but ... Gaddafi had a rich country (oil) and Cubans mostly live at a fairly basic level (and don't pay their doctors a lot). Most of the other countries do it through taxation. It isn't all that onerous, Beats getting a big bill while you are sick or during an emergency.

8584 2018-06-20 05:37:09 How sad, as a medical drug in the form of and oil is okay but as to smoke it - disgusting now everything will smell of the shity stuff
8585 2018-06-20 05:36:55 aaaaaah thank you oro !!!  And of course you can bb.

Purple shampoo, and a whole lot of nourishing/repairing oil 
8586 2018-06-20 05:36:03 I agree with the Squamish Nation, especially if it could turn into another Valdez oil spill. That was long ago, but the environment still suffers from it. Even sadder is the fact that such a huge oil company only had to pay for a small portion of the clean up. Taxpayers the rest.

8590 2018-06-20 05:35:42 one of those oil diffusers!
8591 2018-06-20 05:35:30 C'mon, what's a bot gotta do to get an oil fix around here?
8592 2018-06-20 05:35:21 Olive oil, Costco tofu, onions, garlic, New Orleans Cajun seasoning from Safeway. Hella simple haha
8593 2018-06-20 05:35:19 Okay can we talk about how fucked up it is that the US still won’t accept Palestine as a sovereign state. Oil and money really is more important to y’all than lives huh.
8594 2018-06-20 05:35:18 Wow that’s actually impressive i’ve always thought oil paintings are the hardest material to the point I didn’t even bother trying it haha, but being pretty good at it from the beginning is awesome. lol i feel like i keep throwing compliments too much but srsly I LOVE IT OK BYE
8595 2018-06-20 05:35:12 Gee, Donny isn’t a very smart businessman screwing up oil sales, coal sales, soybean sales, pork sales to China. I thought he was bringing jobs to America.
8596 2018-06-20 05:34:59 The Venezuelan economy is based on what? Petroleum.
What happened to the price of petroleum? Collapsed. What would have happened if the oil industry hadn't been nationalized? Even LESS money in the economy. Socialism didn't fail. The capitalist industry it relied on did.
8597 2018-06-20 05:34:33 Use olive oil. That may be a solution
8598 2018-06-20 05:34:32 I have no comments. It is just the old habit as oil beat reporter that I keep surfing once in a while to check data.

8602 2018-06-20 05:34:11 Hahaha well then I guess checking someones compression, their oil, or a bad camshaft would be carporn fetishes!

8613 2018-06-20 05:32:27 I believe there is ambiguity on the EU “can’t”. IRI only cares about sale of oil in  and reatriate money. Technically, if EU had spine, there could pressure use of central bank transfers. BUT it’s EU. If they can’t unite over JCPOA, Trade War etc they should just all do EUEXIT
8614 2018-06-20 05:32:17 reading and getting an oil change tomorrow. the only real plans I have tbh. this break has been so refreshing.

8619 2018-06-20 05:31:37 Thanks.... and yes it is! This is the fourth oil painting I've done and actually it's something you should really try! I'm still practicing 
8620 2018-06-20 05:31:26 I’ve read rubbing olive oil on them works. Also working on upper body strength especially chest muscles 
8621 2018-06-20 05:31:26 Erik, National Security is all about the price of oil and what kind and how much business Russia and China are doing in the US. To say otherwise demonstrates your complicity in a conspiracy to defraud the US.- You  continue to mislead. I'm Glad you lied to Mueller, you're a Nazi.
8622 2018-06-20 05:30:47 Kerosene heaters are dangerous too. We were an oven heat family in Connecticut. It was cheaper than filling the tank with heating oil

8625 2018-06-20 05:30:16 I don’t like recipes that need special things... like who has ground but oil and rice wine vinegar? And if I bought them will I use them again before they expire? You know.

8626 2018-06-20 05:30:14 I’m convinced all this stuff I been doing to go into labor is myths cause why am I still carrying a baby in my stomach only thing I haven’t done is drink castor oil and I won’t be doing that!
8627 2018-06-20 05:30:05 I’m sure they are used to avoiding greasy disasters thanks to Trumps friends in the oil industry.
8628 2018-06-20 05:30:00 It does reduce carbon dioxide (for a while), but in the other hand you need to recharge and it takes electric supplies, could be from oil fuel engine.
8629 2018-06-20 05:29:45 So they want to build ranches from oil money from another place to enrich strangers. What a country.

8636 2018-06-20 05:28:17 Govt has great strategy. Affordable homes no longer affordable homes. In Taranaki Govt has banned new oil and gas exploration and expects that decision to make Taranaki houses cheaper so can be financed on welfare payments. Affordable. Clever plan aye?

8659 2018-06-20 05:24:05 Sure oil has done some good. But it spills, causes smog, and, oh yeah, climate change. Green energy doesn’t do any of that.

8667 2018-06-20 05:20:23 At least if they had not invested 4.5 billions of tax money in a Texas oil company we'd say it's ok we're helping the environment! maybe it's just a cash grab to finance KM deal
8668 2018-06-20 05:20:21 sigh Keep ignoring the facts the harm sadly wont just affect you but all the world.

8704 2018-06-20 05:13:05 Mam. We often consider petrol pump owners as thieves, but largely they are honest.

Transport = $0
Sure, the plants need to be maintained, but so do coal-fired power stations etc.

オリーブ油は、オリーブの果実から得られる植物油である。
8811 2018-06-20 04:51:17 And it 2018, they need to step it up a notch and get an “active cal” built in. If the gps is telling you it’s off line, the compass and the WAS is telling you it’s swerving, it’s should be fully capable of fine tuning on the go. And adjusting parameters as the oil heats up.
8812 2018-06-20 04:51:05 Canada needs to shut off the Hydro electricity to the US, turn off the oil pipeline, pass the law on patents for pharmaceuticals and start making generic. Mexico and all of South America need to kick out the DEA and CIA, Europe needs to give the boot to all military personnel

8825 2018-06-20 04:48:19 Oh that is the MAIN issue I’ve always had it the hotter the oil gets the lazier the steering gets. So frustrating! This is the fourth season with steer command and I’ve got like 8 different calibrations saved. Finally got a better one this year. They need a oil temp sensor
8826 2018-06-20 04:48:18 That’s an interesting response. You’ve managed to reduce all of my thoughts, beliefs, information gathering and intentions to “an Oil and Gas guy from Scotland”. I’m open minded. Please provide me with evidence that Trump is involved in child molestation Sir.
8827 2018-06-20 04:48:05 Lmfao Libya has long been messed up . All the money made from oil went to gaddafi and his goons we have never seen any of the money made by our own countries oil production . Don’t take this as evidence lmao look at how the people were treated and then decide on it
8828 2018-06-20 04:47:57 It’s what plants crave.  I thot we were head’d that direction during the Admin oil cartel years of Bush Jr. now I would give anything to have Bush Jr back as prez  The only way to beat a 45 supporter in an argument is with a club (or the butt of a gun) smh.

8835 2018-06-20 04:47:03 If the parents dunked their children in boiling oil, whose fault would that be?

Nobody forces these illegal immigrants to subject their children to the laws of our country.

In some cases they serially violate the borders of 3 countries to get here.   Enough.

Boo hoo f-ing hoo

8837 2018-06-20 04:46:37 Please tell me how aspiration drives the economy.  Sounds just like a snake oil salesman trying to sell fake products.
8838 2018-06-20 04:46:34 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
8839 2018-06-20 04:46:22 So apparently this bacon scented gun oil is a real thing?  I thought it was a fake product myself lol
8840 2018-06-20 04:45:57 Ice it or use tea tree oil or lavender oil mixed with coconut oil
8841 2018-06-20 04:45:12 Horribe both of you dont belong in your positions or politics one is Olive oil and one is Brututs who transformed from the bully from sandlot movie. Put 2 and 2 together people to avoid catch 22.

8846 2018-06-20 04:44:22 Loving it compared to the Raven piece of crap that it was. Still a little squirly but have a tip to try to recalibrate when oil is hot hot. See if that perhaps fixes the few (and I’m just being picky) squirlyness it has

8849 2018-06-20 04:44:15 So what are your proposals to strenthen the peso viz the USD? What are your suggestions to bring down the price of oil? How can you mitigate the gred of merchants who are taking advantage of the current situation?
8850 2018-06-20 04:44:13 maybe i should switch to oil instead of using acrylic...
8851 2018-06-20 04:44:10 I wouldn’t expect anything less from an oil and gas guy in Scotland. I must ask where you draw the line on morality, and humanity, or rather the lack thereof, that our fake president embodies? Holding infants hostage? Child molestation? What is your “red line”?

8866 2018-06-20 04:42:25 You folks are kidding yourselves,WITHOUT OPEC it WILL make little difference to the overall oil market. Only sufficient amount of capital investments the market is willing to allocate to E&P industry, not any trade institution like OPEC,will be able to balance the demand/supply.
8867 2018-06-20 04:42:14 This happeneded to me! African black soap, tea tree oil, coconut oil and witch hazel really helped mine out 
8868 2018-06-20 04:42:02 Just a little hairspray first does the trick! However.. my place is definitely still covered in glitter  body oil for skin is great too!
8869 2018-06-20 04:41:48 Castor Oil has helped my hair grow ALOT. Find a hair regimen & STICK to it b/c consistency is also key!

8904 2018-06-20 04:36:11 Aviation has a very high dependency on soft oil prices. Fuel costs r approximately 60% of opex.
The 20% growth can come down to almost nothing if the fares increase.

8916 2018-06-20 04:32:41 突然ですがこんにちは柳屋あんず油・公式です(ﾉ･∀･`)ご存知かもですが想像より伸びがいいので１滴〜毛先中心にお試し下さい。タオルドライ後に１滴〜少量を手の平に伸ばし毛先中心に付けると馴染みやすく、再度タオルドライし余分なオイルをオフするのも良いです

8933 2018-06-20 04:29:18 GP isn't there, as they need donations that they can leech of richer folks here. Vultures they are. They don't protest in the Middle East either. Now that's a place with oil. The hypocrisy is mind boggling.
8934 2018-06-20 04:29:05 Clove oil!

8936 2018-06-20 04:28:58 Very bad. 6O turns and runs to find something to patch it and get new oil before she freezes up and dies.
8937 2018-06-20 04:28:53 The main one I’ve been using is Rosehip oil and a collagen serum
8938 2018-06-20 04:28:45 The oil quickly catches and sets you on fire!! There is no way to put the fire out once it starts. You will be burned to the bone!!

8940 2018-06-20 04:28:19 It would be closer to 6.50 or 7.00 a gallon should Canada stop exports. We send 41% of all of your oil imports. The largest supplier America has.

8944 2018-06-20 04:26:26 It doesn't work that way. People will only get based on credits for making serious efforts to cap n trade less pollution. Less dependency on Hydro and other forms of energy like oil/gas heating.< Replace with renewables.

8983 2018-06-20 04:17:48 How about starting with the domestic aid first, like subsidies to oil companies making record profits. Or better yet salary aid with benefits for life to congessional members that only work if you can call it that 100 days out of the year.

8987 2018-06-20 04:17:31 A tip for people with anxiety that helps me a lot. Get some lavender oil and add a dot to your top lip or your temples when you feel like you’re on edge. It’s so calming & comforting.

8993 2018-06-20 04:16:36 Still debating to back out of the model3 I was so exited about. Cars are America’s #1 import, and oil is America’s #1 export, so the challenge was already not in Tesla favor. Which had me from the start:) If employees are not union then they are not valued! Thus lies a problem.

8997 2018-06-20 04:16:05 Buhari will never remove oil subsidy because without subsidy, oil will sale at 350 Naira per litre in all Northern states and about 300 Naira per litre in Southern states..this is minimum and that will make him lose political support. He may however do it if he is re elected

9046 2018-06-20 04:08:05 Two things that kill INR: arms purchase and oil purchase. India needs to invest billions in research so that we don't have to buy arms. Also, oil alternatives should be promoted.
9047 2018-06-20 04:07:17 Almond farmers yes, but not the imstitutionals that take subpar almonds, crush them and use the oil and other parts to make an unnatural liquid called almond “juice”!
9048 2018-06-20 04:07:14 Allowing Consumers to retain some of the gains of lower Intl.oil price could be a win win situation for all in our context. #OilPrices

9051 2018-06-20 04:06:51 The first three days of the healing process is super important, i wouldn’t recommend using either shea butter or tea tree oil for a healing tattoo as it is an open wound and prone to bacteria. Its possibly very irritated but not infected
9052 2018-06-20 04:06:43 Sorry anything with a genocide oil maniac on the front of it like Lincoln automatically disqualifies for me paying attention to it.

9057 2018-06-20 04:05:50 Right?  Do you think Trump is excited about us beefing up trade with other regions?  Or building a pipeline to get more of our oil to tidewater and Asian markets?  We already know he idolizes dictators and has zero respect for international law.  All about "protecting America"
9058 2018-06-20 04:05:46 Bliss Kiss makes a really good natural nail oil blend to help your nails strengthen and grow! And it comes in a brush pen for easy application! Its really good, i highly recommend it to help with growing nails out.
9059 2018-06-20 04:05:45 I love beans.

9064 2018-06-20 04:04:52 I can't eat in the mornings, it makes me feel sick. So I'll do coffee with a little oil, butter or ghee, and vanilla with hwc. That holds me through my gym session and into work a few hours. Then I'm ready for some eggs and meat!

9067 2018-06-20 04:04:42 Tax rebates are far different from subsidies, and subsidized 0 effect green energy costs taxpayers far more than oil. Having heat, sanitized hospital equipment, healthy food has improved health and all because of oil.  Green does none of this.
9068 2018-06-20 04:04:28 I need smth for this oil paint
9069 2018-06-20 04:04:13 ok … so, for many years we're fighting to defeat racism and recognize people for their ability. But since some people think that's not working out as planned, we should institute reverse racism and that'll make everything ok …. wha??????????
9070 2018-06-20 04:03:43 your dad from oil business ?
9071 2018-06-20 04:03:38 Agreed.  Not only previous regim.  But the current also.  How they managed to took over by sabotage the Malaysian economy. Managed to convint EU to ban palm oil.

9075 2018-06-20 04:02:15 I second this or jojoba oil as well, it’s not necessarily an oil, more of a wax so it doesn’t clog pores. I love aloe Vera
9076 2018-06-20 04:02:09 Reality is very different at ground.

Don't become a judge sitting so far..  U guys have done this for middle east many times before.... BTW we have no oil too...

9079 2018-06-20 04:01:41 But Canada, too stupid to take advantage of this, by being able to export oil... yup, Canada will win a trade war with the US for sure.

9081 2018-06-20 04:01:07 I asked my brother why he didn't bring me an Oreo bun from 52° and he said that sounded disgusting... He thought I said I wanted an oil bun

9091 2018-06-20 03:59:00 Use Glossier milky jelly cleanser to wash your face (it's super gentle but it cleans well.) It conditions your skin so it will do good moisturizing. If you need more moisture, try some oil free moisturizers. (A lot of ppl like the tatcha one. I use the andalou natural acai)  :)

9103 2018-06-20 03:57:59 They just raised the price of their motor oil, uh I meant coffee after losing millions on the store closure day. Now they are shutting down stores costing managers, employees jobs, all because 2 guys broke the rules knowing them and the racist cry went up once again.

9107 2018-06-20 03:57:01 Oh, also... you'll probably need multiple bleachings if your hair is a darker brown. Average for darker hair seems to be about three... 40vol is hard on hair. Spread them out over a few days, and use coconut oil on your scalp in between bleachings.

9111 2018-06-20 03:55:53 My understanding is that the AMMV were granted full Military Rights under President Reagan, around 1988. Armies do not go very far without oil/gas, troops need food and ammunition to fight. The Merchant marine was vital to the USA's success in WWII.

9115 2018-06-20 03:55:16 @realDonaldTrump  US Companies had been offshoring good paying jobs to India. India owned US a favor and shouldn't buy Iran oil.

9261 2018-06-20 03:35:30 That's a workaround to trade with Iran. Just like China also buys oil from North Korea, its likely they use gold for that too.

9315 2018-06-20 03:27:07 Actually, Venezuela is in crisis not because of its socialist policies, but because of overreliance on the free international market for oil and I don't even have to finish this sentence because it has NOTHING THE FUCK TO DO WITH THIS.

9384 2018-06-20 03:14:26 Its always been a question for me that we know oil sand costs US and Canada more than 55 to 60 dollars a barrel so why are they blaming (nagging! at)opec for increasing oil prices. They should be happy! Zanganeh sounds reasonable in this.

9421 2018-06-20 03:10:05 Well we would’ve outraged if there was oil at stake. Otherwise, it’s all selective outrage. Whatever the Halliburtons can profit from, that is when outrage materializes.

9429 2018-06-20 03:09:33 Sure would have been helpful had former PC gov’ts not dismantled Peter Lougheed’s $24 Billion Heritage “rainy day fund” and squandered all subsequent lucrative royalty income streams. The intent was to have that fund buffer the inevitable fall of oil demand & price.
9430 2018-06-20 03:09:20 Uhmmm, my family (latinos) eat avocados plain and sometimes with salt and olive oil and some vinegar, that’s it, no cumin, no pepper
9431 2018-06-20 03:09:20 While dissecting the oil data, seen this #AcheDin data point:

ONGC profit in 2013-14 was ₹22095 crores reduced to ₹17900 crores in 2016-17, yep, 23% decrease!

While Reliance profit grown from ₹22493 crores in 2013-14 increased to ₹31425 crores in 2016-17, ie, 40% increase!!
9432 2018-06-20 03:09:14 Doesn't matter how old the car is matters how dirty the oil is but do you.

9463 2018-06-20 03:03:25 No, none of those things. Tarsands, especially, are a drain on our quality of life and have never paid back (to the taxpayer) the investments in infrastructure. Even conventional oil and gas are only 8% of the economy, and none if them are going to be turned off tomorrow...

9531 2018-06-20 02:46:25 I am fond of a nicely potent one called Po Sum On Oil. If you rub it on your face it will cause eye watering. I use it for tight/spasming muscles most often, but also for migraines and congestion when feeling desperate.

You were conned and global warming (A natural occurring cycle) is being used for the next socialist ponzi scheme
9550 2018-06-20 02:41:37 I was sucking on that NO2 gas like there was no tomorrow as well as the IV morphine they gave me. It felt like burning oil had been poured on the whole leg.

9555 2018-06-20 02:41:24 Demand for dollar will remain until oil is traded in dollar.
Other big economic powers have self interest in having USD as global reserve since they themselves have a large percentage of forex accumulated over decades in USD. And large trade volume with US.

9640 2018-06-20 02:26:44 If you don’t do what I did, it’s gonna be harder to flatten in the pan bc it’s sticky. Just add a tiny bit more flour so you can just pick it up and flatten it yourself before putting it on the hot oil

9642 2018-06-20 02:26:37 Sometimes i get the impression that people think oil companies and workers could care less about the environment. Couldn't be farther from the truth.AB  SK and BC workers care and are protective and diligent about nature and their place in it.
9643 2018-06-20 02:26:33 OIL OF EVERY PEARL is great for two reasons:

9657 2018-06-20 02:24:46 No, the "fractional increase" is in Port of Vancouver's overall ship movements; looking at oil movements alone we see a major increase in throughput capacity, which is a good thing, even a very good thing.

9731 2018-06-20 02:12:36 Can any one share how much oil India consumes daily?

My guess daily 64 crore liter is used.
And increase of Rs. 10 per liter gives 640 crores extra money daily means in 4 years govt got 9.4 lakh crore.

To repay almost 2 crore govt collected 5 times from public.

9795 2018-06-20 02:04:10 Might I suggest decreasing the reliance on oil regardless of it's origin is a plus in any sensible person's book.  This was hardly a definitive study and the results may  not apply in other geographic areas..
9796 2018-06-20 02:04:09 A lot of different markets do better with higher gas prices.   Home builders do better because oil companies are hiring for an example.

9819 2018-06-20 02:01:52 I'd like to see you whip out your iPhone and document emissions of (particulate) carcinogens from your local factory, or leave GE a bad Yelp review if an oil line bursts, or maybe have no federal standards for the levels of lead allowed in your water pipes.

9857 2018-06-20 01:56:48 It's not that simple. Ultra light tight oil makes low octane gasoline and is almost useless for making diesel. You can build all the refineries you like but can't change the inherent problems in the composition of the oil.

9872 2018-06-20 01:54:31 Look into their medications and see if they are on statin drugs. If they are, get them off of them immediately. Other things can cause this but this is a major one. Put coconut oil in their diet; organic, virgin, unrefined.

9882 2018-06-20 01:53:00 To keep them healthy, I recommend you to apply jojoba oil on the cuticles 
9883 2018-06-20 01:52:38 That is a sensitive area! While it's not a recommended application, if you want a tip for easier removal, try using baby oil or olive oil to saturate the tape!
9884 2018-06-20 01:52:34 Any tax & incentive that actually reduces carbon emissions and slows climate change would be welcome.  But the right wingers and oil/gas/coal industry don't want anything to change. Any delay or denial is preferable to sensible action.

9926 2018-06-20 01:45:42 Well this is being presented as a defence to high oil retail prices in the last year of governance before elections. This sum of 1.3 lakh crore is nothing compared to what has been pocketed from this windfall. Citing selectively swaying people's mind.
9927 2018-06-20 01:45:40 "Climate change industry"? So does that include oil companies? Because even they are saying human-caused climate change is real.

9929 2018-06-20 01:45:38 I live in the US and I eat Nongshim’s Soon Vegetable ramen! I like to add a little seasame oil and drop an egg in. I’ve been craving it a lot lately!

9936 2018-06-20 01:45:23 There goes the whole "inflation is soaring" narrative.

Rising inflation has mostly been a function of rising oil prices. With oil stabilizing, so will inflation.
9937 2018-06-20 01:45:21 I used to go get massages and I would get slightly embarrassed because of just how much oil they were having to use on me vs on my husband who has quite a bit more expanse to oil up, lol. My body hair just soaked it up.

9941 2018-06-20 01:45:09 I come to this with an open mind John,  I am actually asking for the facts that you have to share.  I believe that the 5 US refinery’s would take what ever they can get, they sell it back to us for double.  Burnaby is not a heavy oil refinery.  Current pipe for light oil. 1/2

'Dude I bring this truck in cause I'm lazy, not because im retarded, the brakes and fluid are fine!'
9958 2018-06-20 01:43:34 Rudy already gave up his whole game. Nothing he says is based in fact or what's real. He is a snake oil salesman and he basically said so. His job is to effect public opinion.
