38 2018-03-29 20:47:14 ultimate implication of China's import substitution tho is that its export orientation has to fade .. making China more self sufficient.   always going to import commodities and export manufactures.  but cannot zero out its imports of manufactures w-o lowering overall trade
39 2018-03-29 20:42:45 That makes the player bigger than the club. Even if Jose is a bell end, commodities come and go. Especially in modern day football pal
40 2018-03-29 20:29:21 O @SindijorPR pode dizer boas sobre os calotes que ele deu em vários trabalhadores. Fora da área jornalística, o sujeito conseguiu falir um grupo que tinha empresas de agropecuária como carro-chefe em pleno boom das commodities. Algo que acho incrível...
41 2018-03-29 20:20:33 I tend to think pro days dont have much impact. Certainly not on known commodities. He doesnt need to prove he is fast.
Now if he didn t have that rep already and he went out and put up a lightning 40, that might help.
42 2018-03-29 20:15:25 ...si los commodities ya no son la mayor fuente de divisas cómo generar ingresos, pa' cuándo las estrategias q' mitiguen el impacto por las medidas arancelarias de EEUU y China, porque decir que no haya controles al libre mercado no se lo va a obedecer Xi Jinping ni Trump, y etc.
43 2018-03-29 20:09:11  You always had that one kid at school whose mar would buy them tons of packs, and from sept to June they were like a Wall Street commodities trader & everyone’s best mate!
44 2018-03-29 20:07:34 Usually I can stabilize commodities just by hinting at using strategic reserves. We can try that first.
45 2018-03-29 20:07:24 Until the people protest nothing will change. The agenda is one of private property. " Homes" must become commercial units # commodities # mynameis
46 2018-03-29 20:00:32 You come across as having a lot of doom and gloom. That makes me sad.
So, you are now referring to commodities. These prices fluctuate with the market. Supply and demand.
47 2018-03-29 19:59:01 Companies connected with so much corruption that make laws to serve their own interests may be smart business for them, but we are not commodities. We are people
48 2018-03-29 19:58:56 I agree that being able to push their agenda of CNY for oil/gold/commodities would be hugely beneficial to them (especially with their One Belt One Road aspirations). I just have a feeling that the debt situation itself might impair their ability to execute as planned
49 2018-03-29 19:58:53 They are assets, stocks and commodities. 
The unknown youth always has insulation. When a commodity becomes known their value drops. 
CJA would be a prime example of this. Guy keeps producing yet isnt worth anything. Alfred Morris was this guy as well.
50 2018-03-29 19:52:21 All i knew is that,re packaging Buhari in s build up to 2019 can't work this time,let those who are benefiting from his table keep deceiving him when Nigerians who are affected with price of commodities that has been hike twice compared to what it was in PDP regime will decide.
51 2018-03-29 19:51:56 And I fully get this viewpoint too. Sure, there’s criticisms behind the profits, commodities, the economies behind it all. Your criticisms behind it are valid and rooted in truth. But I will continue to defend film/theater/the arts as a “effective” communication vehicle.

53 2018-03-29 19:44:19 Why would vegans be unified on this? All we agree on is that owning other lives and treating them like commodities is wrong.
54 2018-03-29 19:34:52 First I was the sentiment guy, then the commodities guy. Personally I like to think of myself as the jack of all trades guy but whatever works 
55 2018-03-29 19:31:06 Only those who are still being feed by their parent will accept d fact that PDP has destroyed Nigeria when Buhari APC even came to make it worst. When u go to the market to buy commodities of different products may be you will understand better. They can't fool me,am not a kid.
56 2018-03-29 19:30:54 Thank you very much! - I always enjoy your commodity tweets - I am trying to branch out get more active in commodities.

59 2018-03-29 19:14:19 we'll likely see one more rally in the equity markets, and a solid downswing in the commodities markets at some point in the near future. Bond yields won't rise for the foreseeable short term. When that bubble pops, the reverse will likely occur after a short time lag.
60 2018-03-29 19:02:40 Indeed, an oft forgotten aspect of the drive to renewable energy and energy storage is the rapidly increasing demand on subsurface commodities - i.e. mining, not all of which are indefinitely sustainable.  Not a criticism, but when we draw exponential curves, good to remember.

74 2018-03-29 17:48:00 Yes absolutely, a regional identity may help fragment the market & create a value added point of difference for some less price sensitive consumers, the more we can do this the less our products are seen as generic commodities

86 2018-03-29 16:47:14 They also fail to realize that failure to assemble an economic team, the sudden ban placed on some commodities which we don’t have the capacity to produce yet , invariably driving the prices up brought us to this point. Atiku2019

225 2018-03-29 01:46:00 I wonder if his commodities, housing and utilities are due on the first of April?
Did he pay the water bill?

226 2018-03-29 01:44:34 just bc you’ve thrived doesn’t mean you can press your opinions on agricultural commodities to be wrong when you have no real knowledge on their production or benefits. What is at the grocery store is only the end product :)
227 2018-03-29 01:30:11 SPX will fall faster than commodities -> huge reversal, but not bullish 
228 2018-03-29 01:24:44 It is COLLAPSE OF SPX, AND LESS IN COMMODITIES FALL SPEED !!!!

232 2018-03-29 00:34:55 You have to understand that Binance is just a shop, like Amazon, while crypto assets are commodities that reside on blockchain. You can bring down the shop, but cryptos still remain out there and their value will keep rising.
233 2018-03-29 00:31:42 I feel that way about corporations. They are about $$$. The consumer is not of interest to them. They can get us to buy whatever they produce thanks to ads. Ppl R commodities to them.
234 2018-03-29 00:30:43 it's not if i say so. it is fact.

real estate, commodities, equities etc. assets like this are a 1 in 500yr event.  

Your lucky to be alive to witness what's about to happen.

It's about returns, not investing. Bull mkts do this, they make stars and dogs. But when the easy returns slow, funds start to invest.
238 2018-03-29 00:22:18 God’s new world order is full of holiness. ●Satan’s new world order is full of sin. Satan’s work is to make his new world order acceptable to all. The problem though is that sin almost always comes with many other satanic commodities like sickness, depression, stress, poverty.

240 2018-03-29 00:11:06 Why can't we just trust women? Why are we, as a country, so insistent on denying women's rights to their own body? I actually can't even articulate how much it enrages me that women are treated like objects and commodities to be consumed and then discarded. I am absolutely...
241 2018-03-29 00:07:26 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
242 2018-03-29 00:06:22 I know my opinion does not count for much in the world of crypto but I find your words to be filled with honesty and integrity, rare commodities in the crypto sphere.
