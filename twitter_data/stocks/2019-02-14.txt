6 2019-02-14 23:55:42 Let’s all take a moment and thank Trump & republicans for doing absolutely nothing about gun violence on a federal level. No improvement on background checks. No red flag laws. No legislation on bump stocks. Nothing.  Republicans in congress-you are useless and a disappointment.
7 2019-02-14 23:55:27 I can’t agree with you more. Although it is very rare and hard for me to discover hidden jams in Canadian markets. Growth stocks without solid cash flows occasionally pop up like $SHOP but can never find myself to commit to a sizeable position.

9 2019-02-14 23:55:00 Bot no one is trying to take your imaginary guns it’s the violence and bump stocks and automation that is threatening my kids at school. Oh and fake accounts like yours!
10 2019-02-14 23:52:28 I do.  Stocks don’t have anything to do with progressive or GOP agendas. :)

Does anyone have a good source to keep track of both large and small Cannabis related companies?
12 2019-02-14 23:52:00 He just banned bump stocks with an EO, Has always be available
13 2019-02-14 23:51:31 2nd amendment doesn't guarantee the rights to bump stocks, extended magazines or even bullets..... maybe a work around is common sense bullet laws. Testing, background checks etc in order to be allowed to own bullets... 
14 2019-02-14 23:51:26 Its always considered in the “top 3-4” but look at the other top stocks, they are more than double the share price of aurora, they really need some kimd of partnerships and a big cash injection, until then or big news, they will be stagnant
15 2019-02-14 23:48:55 Sell Spanish sovereign bonds and Spanish bank bonds and bank stocks. Catalonia legislators trial is the canary in the coal mine. Sell. Sell. Sell.
16 2019-02-14 23:48:54 Using  quotestream for financial info and L2 atm. But they can be wrong at times as well, especially with newly traded stocks.

Best way is to hit up SEDAR tbh. But quotestream for the most part is usually solid.
