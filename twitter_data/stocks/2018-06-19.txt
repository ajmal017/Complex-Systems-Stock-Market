75 2018-06-19 23:30:14 BAN BUMP STOCKS!!
76 2018-06-19 23:30:01 Not a good analogy. Stocks are purchased as an investment strategy to increase wealth. Homes — in most cases — are purchased as a residential option to give you somewhere to live.

80 2018-06-19 23:28:50 It’ll be just as effective as the steps he took to ban bump stocks after #1October. Which was to write a letter to the ATF.

107 2018-06-19 23:11:37 They do. And if the scores are tied it doesn't go by % so sometimes people will pull Wii U invitational zero and try to timr you out when they're super down with even stocks.

109 2018-06-19 23:11:03 Health Insurance stocks, which have gone to a school with bad intentions.
110 2018-06-19 23:09:47 @RyanDetrick awaiting your weighty thoughts on what happens to Dow 30 stocks after they are booted from the index, ie GE.
111 2018-06-19 23:09:30 maybe, but if you use that thinking for both sides of every trade then when do you trade? stocks don’t show expensive options just sitting around.

115 2018-06-19 23:04:41 Agreed. I haven't sold any bitcoin. 80%+ of my net worth is locked up in it. 

That said, I still have stocks, RE, cash(dry powder), & some gold. My paycheck is in fiat, I don't have to sell bitcoin to have exposure to other asset classes. It helps me weather these downturns.

I wonder if you're talking about the ideal world instead, where there's no wars, no conflict, no controversy, just life going smoothly, stocks going up, etc.
118 2018-06-19 23:03:52  It’s stocks. 10$ stock i bought went up to 17$ if i bought 100 of them from jump then that would give me about 1700 right now
119 2018-06-19 23:03:26 I would be take a 4-1.  Trying to layer in and out of options is tough for my trading size.  Do appreciate the efficiency of stocks in the 200-300 range

123 2018-06-19 23:00:20 3 technology stocks made a big climb  on Tuesday:
$WIX 30.5%, $EFII 17.7%, $AMBR 10.7%
124 2018-06-19 22:59:32 Correct - once stocks that have been as oversold as $MNKD has (and for as long as it has) finally start heading back towards a more realistic valuation, they usually end up overshooting by just as much in the upside as they did on the downside (so patience is usually in order)
125 2018-06-19 22:57:44 Thanks Marlon.. We all end up over-trading when managing different accounts.. 
So many stocks when breakout together, it feels like "wish I was in this stock and that" but I have learnt my way to go heavy on one then to have multiple :) end goal making $ and easy to manage

134 2018-06-19 22:50:05 Do you see how what they’re doing is wrong and possibly illegal? Look at their stocks. Their shares are going down fast. Investors are scared because something isn’t right and there is someone working on a lawsuit as we speak.
135 2018-06-19 22:49:25 better look at the stock markets, better get out now it's on a down turn that you have never seen. just what I can see . I am not in stocks anymore just to many liers
136 2018-06-19 22:48:45 I remember that 2014 chart...pretty sure a bottom call on top tech stocks came along with it...

138 2018-06-19 22:47:41 And how heartless do you have to be to deny them refuge?
139 2018-06-19 22:46:32 This isn't "human trafficking", this is children so desperate to escape the crime and violence of their countries that they are traveling, alone, across hundreds of miles of desert to reach us. How desperate do you think a kid has to be to do that?

150 2018-06-19 22:41:38 Swapping $GE out for $WBA Walgreens proofs again to me that the Dow is just a curated list of stocks and not an index. Sadly, GE was also the oldest member of the Dow
151 2018-06-19 22:40:57 FOCUS - key to success in trading

169 2018-06-19 22:30:03 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
170 2018-06-19 22:30:02 Facts? Many of the economic statistics Trump touts are a continuation of the economics of the past 10 years, although stocks are not doing well right now based on Trump's recent trade war/tariffs. Trump has done more to unleash bigotry & racism into the mainstream. Not a success.
171 2018-06-19 22:29:58 $AGEN $CATB $NK $RNVA lets see if they bounce a little.

$INTU, $JCOM, $ELLI, $SSNC, $PLUS, $WIX
193 2018-06-19 22:19:46 Similar to Jeremy, that's probably why we get along. I use a mandatory 3:1 reward to risk on the underlying stock and look for stocks within 1% of the point of control on multiple time frames at certain retracements to initiate the position.
194 2018-06-19 22:18:59 Smash 4 tournaments usually are, most people want 3 stocks for Smash ultimate (I agree)

204 2018-06-19 22:14:26 Tariffs, David Kotok chair & chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors said rising tensions are “either setting up huge buying opportunity in US stocks which is what we believe or setting up an economy that will be forced into recession by protectionism (we don’t believe).”

229 2018-06-19 22:01:15 NASDAQ is another index of different stocks. Anyway, if someone is replacing GE, which has been a presence in that index since it's inception, it means that someone's decided that GE is no longer indicative of how the market performs.
230 2018-06-19 22:01:11 Invest in a index fun, rather then the hand picked oil stocks back in '08

232 2018-06-19 22:00:34 It’s the last of the original Dow stocks I believe
233 2018-06-19 21:59:59 Yep to do with there stocks or something.Just think someone our end leaked the news to Journalists early otherwise we'd probably not of seen much on this story.
234 2018-06-19 21:59:42 The Dow Jones Industrials Index, or the Dow Jones, or the Dow, is a benchmark for how well the stock market is doing. So when someone says "the Dow is up x points," they're referring to the sum of the value of the stocks in the index.

237 2018-06-19 21:57:40 We should pull our money from the banks and stocks. Crash this entire freaking machine.
238 2018-06-19 21:57:14 There is no good reason for a bump stock. When you buy one what are we supposed to believe you are doing with it other than planning mass murder? You want us to respect responsible gun ownership the be responsible & ban bump stocks now.
239 2018-06-19 21:57:05 Although Obama wasn't my favorite, he was put into the middle of the 2008 resecion. Our economy recovered and has been growing ever since. Trump claims he is the reason, but if you look at stocks and the econometrics before trump, Obama left him with a growing economy
240 2018-06-19 21:56:50 Great point...wonder if CNN will air this fact? Not gonna happen.

243 2018-06-19 21:54:48 the nation can’t have its cake and eat it too, if you want stocks to go up for your benefit you’ll be feeding the system of billionaires you hate, but then when they deflate you laugh because it’s an L for Trump? We’re all biased obv but I thought this’d be the one thing you like
244 2018-06-19 21:54:36 3 stocks in that lag tho... Maybe I'm wrong and smash 5 is that fast?
245 2018-06-19 21:54:12 Indeed. I have to kinda agree with Cramer, in that one of the FAANG stocks could have been switched. 
I'd actually support a Dow 50, or Dow 100 index, with ALL the FAANG within it. @jimcramer
246 2018-06-19 21:54:03 @bigthangs @CNBC they sure don't "report" it. Like today. "d mkt fell 300pts" while index w/2000 stocks over5bn cap were flat and SPY -.3%
247 2018-06-19 21:53:43 The people were assuming that we always support local government - and we can restore American steel, we're going to a simple majority, which the Fake news writers. #FakeNews and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress REFUSE to report the facts! Remember, ObamaCare premiums &

249 2018-06-19 21:53:08 I heard all stocks at the local DIY had been bought and sprayed with numbers....
250 2018-06-19 21:52:42 There are 30 stocks that make up the widely followed Dow Jones Industrial Average. These companies are supposed to represent a cross-section of American businesses. Routinely, over the decades, some companies get replaced in order to more accurately reflect relative importance.
251 2018-06-19 21:52:31 @TheFive WTF @donnabrazile who made that decision, FIRE THIER A$$! She’s a proven lying sack of liberal screw it Im changing the channel
252 2018-06-19 21:52:24 no more bump stocks
253 2018-06-19 21:52:21 Don't worry! This time is different. Back in 2000 there were no smartphones available #stocks
254 2018-06-19 21:52:00 forget the rules mate its the trading style u need to trade the type of stocks u have been shown. heart in your mouth trades. sit in tricks chat and the fuckers chilled to bits talking thru all his trades mint craic as well. good luck anyway.
255 2018-06-19 21:51:55 Every pick so arbitrary so unscientific? But still correlates with S&P500? Statistical magic? I still prefer S&P500! Broader better! I will still avoid U.S & go abroad for stocks! U.S in secular decline. That is why Trump's trade wars!
256 2018-06-19 21:51:53 In all honesty, I like how Smash Ultimate should have 3 stocks. 2 stocks in Smash 4 seems to be off in my opinion.
257 2018-06-19 21:51:06 In other words, and we stop here, time is up to you, how you collect your sufficient sample. When you buy and sell stocks, you first buy, then sell, then buy again, then sell, etc separated by microseconds or days or weeks.
258 2018-06-19 21:50:51 What stocks y’all like? I wanna add one more to my portfolio. Thinking about ETSY. Maybe
259 2018-06-19 21:50:44 Stocks told an L today. 
260 2018-06-19 21:50:39 Do you have any high conviction stocks? I would like to load up in my ira.
261 2018-06-19 21:49:31 $GE will be removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average—and replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance. GE was an original components in the index of 30 stocks.
262 2018-06-19 21:48:59 They won’t get “brownie points” because they’re “Fake News!”
263 2018-06-19 21:48:44 I was just being funny since trump claims any small bump in stocks were because of him lmao! No I’m not a fan of Wall Street billionaires, but I do have stocks so it’s important to me.
264 2018-06-19 21:48:09 @CNBCFastMoney when are these big tech companies going to split these damn stocks? Small investors have no shot except with options. Prices too high
265 2018-06-19 21:47:58 Wow. They sought to block the sale of about 60 specific makes and models of semi-automatic firearms & so-called "copycat weapons" with features such as folding stocks & flash suppressors. As though a gun without said features could not be used to commit murder; how ignorant.
266 2018-06-19 21:47:38 GE's stock has fallen more than 55 percent over the last 12 month. Doesn’t really meet the requirements to remain part of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow
267 2018-06-19 21:46:18 Thank you!!! Sana may stocks HAHAHAHAHA kundi wala kwenta pinunta ko sa HKG 
268 2018-06-19 21:44:25 You wouldn't lose if you picked the right stocks, and diversified properly. And the stocks I named were the right stocks I feel coz I've been following tech for a while.
269 2018-06-19 21:42:44 I think the reason why fang stocks are not in the Dow Jones , is because they have no dividend . The Dow jones will not put a company with no dividend
270 2018-06-19 21:42:27 Nova stocks are definitely on the decline imo. Still very strong.
271 2018-06-19 21:42:21 It was not a kind gesture, it was a necessary evil to prevent a catastrophe and the fact that Labour had not built any new council housing has meant that what council housing stocks are left are in massive demand due to realistic rents, private rents can be double council rents.
272 2018-06-19 21:42:15 Walgreens boots GE from the Dow. 

$GE had the smallest weighting on the Dow despite having a $112B market cap. Although it is just half the market cap of GE, $WBA will have a greater Dow weighting than 6 other Dow stocks ($PFE, $KO, $CSCO, $VZ, $INTC, $MRK)
273 2018-06-19 21:41:33 Ok cool just wanted to clarify what country we are talkin about. I definitely have positions in American stocks for this move...hopefully
274 2018-06-19 21:41:17 I never said that the military uses bump stocks. By the way, I served in the military 30 years. How about you?
275 2018-06-19 21:39:31 I mean military type weapons and those bump stocks and things that can modify guns to be military level should be illegal and only for military use. Common guns like pistols etc need stricter background checks to prevent street and other forms of senseless gun violence

284 2018-06-19 21:36:35 I remember when we first started the crypto corner. I was so lost. Now I don’t even trade stocks. Just have my MGTI and my weed stocks sittin for my kids.
285 2018-06-19 21:35:57 If the bathtub is over flowing you turn off the water first, then start to drain it.  The wall will have a big beautiful door. It will slow the flow of drugs and human trafficking. 80% of the children are not with their parents. It’s stopping the human trafficking.

300 2018-06-19 21:29:40 The Dow Jones Industrial Average will no longer include General Electric. GE is being replaced by Walgreens. GE was one of the original Dow stocks, part of the index since 1907.
301 2018-06-19 21:28:51 Walgreens Boots Alliance ( $WBA) is joining the Dow Jones Industrial Average

302 2018-06-19 21:26:49 A double amen! The problem with economic ripples, is that it starts with a boom, and the wealthy makes millions...sells the inflated stocks, and then the little person takes it in the shorts after market correction.
303 2018-06-19 21:26:24 Great, now maybe $GE will go higher.

315 2018-06-19 21:19:02 Given the current volatility and manipulation of cryptocurrency and how many people are treating them as investments (or at least as day trading penny stocks) I think they do need some oversight. Do you think that is a fair assessment?

384 2018-06-19 20:54:45 Another very interesting post (most underrated crypto blog imo). It's important to note a lot of wealthy people have dollar *denominated* assets (e.g., stocks) and they largely won't be affected. The people most hurt would be USD (or near USD - e.g., money market) HODLers.
385 2018-06-19 20:53:38 That has never been tried in a major court case and never been decided by SCOTUS what it entails. 

Its a theoretical thing until then, because elected officials all own companies/stocks of companies that recieve payments from foreign  states. (1/2)

438 2018-06-19 20:23:34 Almost 30 years investing and I’ve rarely increased cash more that 20% throughout that time, to be fair when I first started I was only holding a few stocks as that’s built up I’m now holding 40+ so much harder to watch or sell for that matter.  Nothing wrong with profit taking.
439 2018-06-19 20:23:16 And that is the reason why i´m a Trader and not Investor. I dont believe what they always say that stocks bring 8% per year and you must only buy and hold. This will not work in the future.

446 2018-06-19 20:20:28 Think different than the crowd.
The majority of investors look to squeak out small but quick gains in the hottest trends-stocks.
The wealthy buy bottoms holding out for huge gains even though in the short term there’s lots of pain.
Nothing comes easy if so everyone would be rich

458 2018-06-19 20:14:10 Market recap: Two stocks with big China exposure led Dow lower. $BA $CAT. But the Nasdaq and Russell 2000 held up relatively well.
459 2018-06-19 20:14:09 The fed could stop spending 89 billion a month on printing and buying our own stocks, bonds and mutual funds, in order to hide inflation. That's none of my business though.

467 2018-06-19 20:10:46 I saw zero positive stories on the gun control front - no coverage of the sit-in he did, or bump stocks stuff. Media raged that it wasn't "enough".

They said they didn't have documentation that bias affected specific decisions. The report was FULL of bias tho - Wray is horrible.
468 2018-06-19 20:10:39 Gains are made anyway. It's the volatility you bet on. #trump & his gang are gaining every day by falling stocks I bet. Its insider trading by them & their friends.

@JohnLegere
472 2018-06-19 20:08:56 World stocks fall again: Europe -.7%; US -.4%. As the probability of an all out trade war increases from possible to probable, markets will be volatile and a worldwide 2% or more one day decline becomes more likely. Market not for faint-hearted for the next month or more.
473 2018-06-19 20:08:55 Only they don't have stocks. The Trump voters that do are the billionaire donors.

477 2018-06-19 20:06:36 Dow and other stock indexes fell sharply today in reaction to new trade tariffs on China.  Ford, Qualcomm, Boeing, Caterpiller among the stocks falling based on their business in China. This is going to end badly.
478 2018-06-19 20:04:32 Trump makes grand claim of additional Tarrifs on China. China responds “blackmail!” as the markets take a dive. Before the days end it mostly recovers. Someone just made a boatload of money off that rhetoric. I wonder whom. #economics #tradewar #stocks

488 2018-06-19 19:59:36 Surely with small caps there’s much more to come from a raft of growth companies, true they’ll drift with the market but my special situation/recovery stocks well they’re gonna outperform the market 
489 2018-06-19 19:59:07 Couple of bad days here too, -0.4% today. My (now) mainly US stocks have been ‘Trumped’ and lost a couple of % each. Have to say #NFLX I bought heavily in Jan & Feb has been a monster that is still rolling on, another 3.25% added today.
490 2018-06-19 19:58:53 #Stocks,#Indexes As always, rallies off weak bottoms are never major, generally do not make new highs, usually end unsignaled.
491 2018-06-19 19:58:38 Have been humbled by $ASTC today. Congrats to those who profited (in either direction lol). Had a relatively low risk entry, so my loss wasn’t too bad. When r we gonna get some runs on stocks w/ decent daily charts again???

494 2018-06-19 19:58:25 (1/2) @CNBC @DougKass @EconguyRosie @GlobalProTrader The current narrative seems to be that tech stocks are "safety" plays. So, let's go back to the last bear market and see how that strategy fared, shall we? The $SPX dropped ~58% from its high on 10/11/07 to its low on 3/6/09

Some stocks may be available on a share dealing and not on an ISA. For various reasons, such as it not falling within the tax wrapper, it may not be eligible to trade on an ISA account.

520 2018-06-19 19:49:32 In 2018 about 3.9 million boomers are set to retire. Instead pouring money into the market with their 401(k), boomers are now draining money from the stock market. They are selling their stocks. The driving force behind history's greatest bull market has been thrown into reverse.

527 2018-06-19 19:45:28 serious question @TradeFuturesES, with Trump's Tariffs along with other decisions bringing down the DOW for the now and possible foreseeable future sounds like not the best time to be involved in stocks. Agree or disagree?

551 2018-06-19 19:36:08 Ask yourself why you're buying shares? Because they are cheap or because they keep going up?  If the valuation isn't there to underpin them then stocks will take a big  hit when the mkt does eventually fall imo.

555 2018-06-19 19:35:03 Scrap stocks and shares markets.
556 2018-06-19 19:34:18 IPOs concentrate on market tops, therefore investors as a group put more money in stocks during market tops and somewhat lose to the long term trend of market index. Dividends/buybacks take money out of stocks, slightly negating the aforementioned effect.

564 2018-06-19 19:28:02 Sometimes you have to have a #TradeWar to have a Trade Peace.  Stocks will go down over the short term, but they'll bounce back.  If anyone bothers to read Trump, you'll know when to buy and sell.

579 2018-06-19 19:24:12 it’s dangerous to short low float stocks in the  first or even in the second day of a big run.

593 2018-06-19 19:13:05 In The Market: Even in today's #news-driven decline in #stocks, the #nasdaq continues to show it's the leader in 2018. Down 0.3% w/ an hour to go, vs. a 1.1% slide for #DJIA. #NYSE comp off 0.5%. On Nasdaq, losers top winners by a mild 16-13 ratio, vs 3-to-2 on the NYSE #trading
594 2018-06-19 19:13:02 Good, shut it down.  Stocks have tanked due to China trade wars, consumers, farmers, trade workers will suffer.  This folks, is how Trump runs his businesses..into the ground, into bankruptcy.  Trump voters..you fell for this conman, this grifter, you bought all his lies
595 2018-06-19 19:12:53 Some PMs like Sam Isaly had a one in, one out approach to portfolio management, used to call others' portfolios of 70 stocks or more 'stock collectors'. I wasn't so pragmatic, holding one more stock isn't the end of the world & doesn't underestimate human ingenuity
596 2018-06-19 19:12:48 ...turkey for food, rather than mostly for feathers, as earlier people had done. This took a toll on maize stocks, which were fed to turkey, at a time of declining harvests due to the drought. Deforestation and erosion from it also seem to have been going on at some level.

599 2018-06-19 19:11:36 Trump has unknown trade agreement with Putin. He wants trade war... As to the border again he wants stocks to fall the big wheelers can buy up more. People need to look at what is in it for Trump. Stop thinking he gives a shit. He doesn't, and he and Russia have a plan.

629 2018-06-19 18:54:44 The natural inclination for a person is to buy a stock when it's moving up and "red hot" and sell it when it starts tanking. But you actually have to do the opposite to do well. #investing #stocks #wealth
630 2018-06-19 18:54:08 Stocks and securities move in cycles. Breakout, breakdown, consolidation, repeat. It may be a great stock but timing has to be right. Sometimes it needs to cool down a while before you dive in.

831 2018-06-19 17:29:07 Yeah, It's a really easy to understand style. In previous games the stock images suffered a lot for the compression, so this vectors stocks will always look nice and easy to read.
832 2018-06-19 17:29:06 Nobody said it was. The stock market is a measure of confidence in the value of stocks in the near future, as interpreted by people who have been watching them all their lives.

The reason it hasn't tanked is that these experts don't believe Donald when he talks about trade wars

852 2018-06-19 17:21:15 Hold on, crime is up 10% even though “officials do not want to report these crimes”. In other words, you’re saying something that officials haven’t officially reported as happening.

864 2018-06-19 17:16:04 It's fine to ban bump stocks, I am all in favour of that. However most American's get shot by people using hand guns and various other firearms that don't have bump stocks. So in reality banning bump stocks won't solve anything. And anything that is banned, is still available.

Remember under Obama when stocks kept steadily climbing as he pulled us out of Bush's recession?

Is this winning yet? Because it sure looks like failing.
888 2018-06-19 17:06:17 Bump stocks are a public health crisis. The paranoid supporters of bump stocks hiding behind 2A are true true public health crisis.

I've been following the #neveragain movement and they support comprehensive background checks, banning bump stocks and limiting magazine/clip capacities. They are also pushing to ban AR style rifles, not an all out gun ban.

908 2018-06-19 16:59:17 With US equity market cap at 150% of US GDP, likely the only way the US can “win” a trade war is if stocks rise on low volatility through any trade war; fail that & US consumer spending (PCE) growth & US Federal tax receipts will likely come under pressure surprisingly quickly.

977 2018-06-19 16:40:41 Constant bombardment keeps military hardware designers contracted by the government, which boosts their company stocks, which pads the portfolios of our representatives, who approve more money to our military budget and perpetual occupation and ignore the resulting atrocities.

With the right pieces around Alaina (pieces I do think Chicago has) I think she could start being an important presence for the team.

982 2018-06-19 16:38:45 New position (19 Jun 2018): Long $AAOI @ $41.10 pullback/bull flag. Bottom of the flag is my stop loss. #stocks #markets
983 2018-06-19 16:38:32 For me, shorting a stock doesn’t mean I have anything against the company. I short stocks simply to capitalize on overbot conditions. When that subsides & technicals show renewed buying I can go long again.Tsla is currently the only high end EV but I’ve been both long & short it
984 2018-06-19 16:38:14 Chinese stocks are in the shiter today and South America n stocks are way up.

987 2018-06-19 16:36:30 You know the one thing that is probably NOT in Trump’s tax returns?  Stocks.  He doesn’t care about a crash —more cheap property to pick up—and he will tell all the hurting farmers and newly jobless that it’s Obama’s fault because he couldn’t be tough in China.

991 2018-06-19 16:34:33 Also by definition speculation is "investment in stocks, property, or other ventures in the hope of gain but with the risk of loss."  The speculator is there first with the highest risk that nothing will catch. The bandwagon profit seekers come next followed by the FOMO's

993 2018-06-19 16:33:47 The folks who'll be affected by stock market drops are quite a range, from those who invest through work and businesses who rely on stocks to raise capital and value. But those at the very top who have a lot of stock will not be happy because it will finally hit their wallets.

1001 2018-06-19 16:31:57 ive heard before from Wall Street traders who dabble in both stocks and crypto that when stocks decline they have to sell crypto to cover losses. So both markets are correlated somewhat on drops. Trade fears correlate more than currency issues, the latter clearly favors btc.
1002 2018-06-19 16:31:33 $TWTR shorties have a big problem...
1003 2018-06-19 16:31:28 Anyone else confused how this can be about safety when they pass legislation that lets mentally unstable people have guns and don't ban bump stocks? Do they really care about our safety? #FamiliesBelongTogether #WhereAreTheGirls #notaboutsafety #TrumpsKidnappingChildren

1016 2018-06-19 16:29:16 There are countless financial articles posting (often automated) about technical analysis of stocks, but it's a distraction when there's a big announcement, litigation, merger, etc.... Who cares about moving averages then? If you don't day trade don't look at technicals.

1030 2018-06-19 16:23:16 It's sad that we have to call and confirm that the news is real. Makes it harder to trade OTC stocks.

1048 2018-06-19 16:15:22 European Stocks were trading lower after President Donald Trump announced new tariffs against China. China then responded by imposing a 25% tariff on 659 US goods worth $50bn.
1049 2018-06-19 16:15:16 U.S.Stocks slumped, as markets were rattled by a sharp escalation of the trade dispute between the United States and China.
1050 2018-06-19 16:14:58 How long ago was he an FX trader and he might have been a tad busy in the run up to the referendum to study the FX market I'd imagine. It was always close & stocks & shares are always a risk. Take a punt & if right, money to be made. Unless Reece Mog is actually Mystic Mog!

1052 2018-06-19 16:14:33 When your distant uncle suggests you to invest in a particular stock, that's the time to short the stocks. There were plenty of such uncles in my family during late-2007/early 2008 but now they are content with fixed deposits.
1053 2018-06-19 16:14:20 We've been marred and declared a trade war. It's now WWTW. Stocks are evidentiary  it's only Tuesday.
1054 2018-06-19 16:14:16 I can't go long or short single stocks that might be in my area of coverage. As the investing editor, that's basically everything. I can go long indexes and mutual funds, etc...

1066 2018-06-19 16:10:28 The tent city & other trump detention centers are for profit private prisons that are receiving hundreds of millions of tax dollars to build & run these centers with little oversight.

1067 2018-06-19 16:09:39 You definitely should consider it! I just love having a whole time period to be right on my ideas rather than needing to always be right instantaneously. I just started options trading a few weeks ago  was only doing stocks before

1075 2018-06-19 16:05:03 Bought some CQQQ (Chinese tech ETF) this morning. The big Chinese tech stocks are overwhelmingly domestically focused, so I think the current pullback far exceeds potential earnings losses in trade war with US. Long term hold in any event. 购买倾角

1235 2018-06-19 15:02:26 Ok, so I looked it over....what criteria are you using to find the stocks where you are not really using OI and what would be your trigger to buy? As these are not OI plays, they appear to be technically driven.
1236 2018-06-19 15:02:23 I remember the $350B you’re getting from China after his trip. The  opioid  crisis was ending. Mexico paying for wall. Bump stocks. NK not a threat. Health care is easy. Trade wars easy to win. Etc etc etc
1237 2018-06-19 15:02:17 @chesse47 I believe this tit for tat tariff game with China is a game plan to have stocks drop so trump his friends and China can buy low and sell high after they kiss and make up. China said they won’t do nothing until mid July, I predict they make up by then.

1249 2018-06-19 14:58:43 The argument that millionaires are the most productive citizens is an insult to people who own businesses and contribute jobs and revenue to the economy (like me) yet are far from being millionaires. Many millionaires income comes from passive investment (stocks, property, etc)
1250 2018-06-19 14:58:25 Exactly right! Remember Las Vegas? So many slaughtered out in the open at a concert by ONE white man with assault weapons.

Trump still hasn't banned bump-stocks, used to kill in mass numbers. He doesn't care about protecting us. He is just a racist with too much power!

1278 2018-06-19 14:50:49 Completely agree. With currencies behaving like individual stocks in terms of volatility, undervalued safe harbors like PMs will pay off significantly but need to ignore the ST noise and follow the smart money: China, Russia, JPM.

1464 2018-06-19 13:59:06 The argument is that passive is distorting at the fringes. Which makes stocks within the index more expensive. This effect however is diminished by active investors.

1476 2018-06-19 13:55:33 Noob Trump! Want to have trade war with China? Too yonge too naive! The worry of trade war bring the US stocks down, not Chinese stocks in US market. See performance of Chinese stocks - IQ, HUYA, BILI. US investors believe the Chinese economy and companies are better than US’s.
1477 2018-06-19 13:55:08 The argument is that the passive wrapper is causing distortion. Don’t change it. That is what is being asserted. And it is not true. Stocks are being bought and sold every day.
1478 2018-06-19 13:55:03 I buy stocks. What do you need to know?
1479 2018-06-19 13:54:47 Trump fucking up ALL my stocks right now
1480 2018-06-19 13:54:09 Yesterday's news of President Trump's Space Force sent the stocks of Spaceley Sprockets and Cogswell Cogs up 30% at the close of trading.

1496 2018-06-19 13:49:50 Agreed,  agreed, disagree
NAAIM index this high has led to higher prices
I think stocks are in a mild, modest pullback where weakness should be bought for a run to 27K next quarter. Internals way too strongly for meaningful downside
1497 2018-06-19 13:49:20 $IQ continues to go up even after all this tariff talks. #stocks #investing
1498 2018-06-19 13:48:57 The crash I’ve been mentioning is coming. Our toes are over the edge. Buy #gold, #silver,  Asian, and Russian stocks. JP Morgan just warned of risk, Russia sold off 50% of their US #bonds and #WarrenBuffet pulled out of a dry wall company-meaning drop in future house construction

1502 2018-06-19 13:48:14 In days like this is so peaceful to be taken out by some tight stops to lock some profits above your average gain as @markminervini taught us. Even if the stocks seem good, protection first. 30% of $BZUN gone, maybe more later
1503 2018-06-19 13:48:04 Hi again. So $CAT had both a 2 and 5 minute OR breakdown. Daytrading rules would be a stop like 146.34. Whether you tried or not, works or not-good intro into shorting gaps on weak stocks. And once you get enuf profit go to no loss stop. Have a target 2.
1504 2018-06-19 13:47:15 Why wouldn't it be? It's just another news site.
1505 2018-06-19 13:47:13 It depends. If you track successful day traders (who post huge gains and sometimes losses on Twitter), they trade 1-3 momentum stocks per  day. After that becomes overtrading and maybe revenge trading.
1506 2018-06-19 13:47:12 $BTC going up and stocks going down.
Something Fishy 
Any inter linking institutional  /retailers ???
@tradingroomapp
1507 2018-06-19 13:46:21 I think it's pure FOMO & momentum chasing. When the Market really gets problematic, everything goes down w/o much exception... certainly not these kinds of stocks. In general, breadth has been narrowing, which is also a concerning sign... but that's another conversation.
1508 2018-06-19 13:46:14 so that means most of corporate america is SUFFERING .who cares for 5 stocks
1509 2018-06-19 13:46:14 I challenge you to find anyone who really cares unless they're rolling in profits with not much else at risk but get free upside. I own BTC along with a ton of other asset classes & my fav right now is the USD for when a crash does come in BTC or stocks I'm going bargain hunting.

1514 2018-06-19 13:45:15 One way to increase your comfort with risk is to familiarize yourself with the history of the market. Yes, stock prices can be volatile, but over the long term, stocks have outperformed all other asset classes. #investingbasics #TeamBione
1515 2018-06-19 13:45:00 it's very easy to know which stocks will surge 100% in hindsight but much more difficult to know in advance...
1516 2018-06-19 13:44:59 Aigis is hype. Orgia mode became a 66 hover dash that uses a guage that functions like CF Rachel's Wind meter. Orgia only specials are now meter burn specials.

She can still hover dash cancel certain moves for Aigis' iconic mindboggling mixups, but a cancel uses two stocks.

1527 2018-06-19 13:43:14 Keep a note of stocks that are underperforming when market is rising, or outperforming when market is falling. These stocks can be the best bets when the market trend reverses #Relativestrength

1536 2018-06-19 13:41:22 im no expert and i cant say that i totally understand stocks and all that but from what i understand is that if US stocks are dropping that means every other company in the us will drop at stocks too? doesn't seem fair in my eyes because politics/news can mess up economy easily!
1537 2018-06-19 13:40:53 Stocks also down in Asian markets as I understand. We need some shifts because many of our trade policies and tech transfers were focused on helping other countries keep up -- then when we need a change because those generous deals were not sustainable forever we are the bad guy?

1587 2018-06-19 13:25:37 Original point remains. A lot of stocks benefit from being inside the main indices - even though a couple inside of them (GE) have fallen. And it also doesn’t mean there are strong large cap performers outside the indexes

1608 2018-06-19 13:18:40 Most of the sectors like Auto, Metal, Cement, Pharma, Tech and Banking stocks declined sharply.
1609 2018-06-19 13:18:19 Metal stocks like Jindal Steel, Hindalco, Vedanta, SAIL slipped over 2-4% on account of fall in base metal prices on LME and fear of trade war which may impose tariff by US on China goods.
1610 2018-06-19 13:18:12 @bullmatters $IQ $JD EXTREMELY different trading price profiles. The recent run in these Chinese stocks was momo, fomo, greed, sentiment imo
1611 2018-06-19 13:18:10 Pharma stocks faced profit booking in the later part of the day.

1615 2018-06-19 13:17:27 @jposhaughnessy Can you elaborate something on adding on stock positions using a defined strategy for investors who are buy and hold type and would like to buy the same stocks over a long period of time
1616 2018-06-19 13:17:11 Metal and mining stocks dropped as copper prices declined sharply in  global commodity markets. Realty stocks declined. Shares of index  heavyweight Reliance Industries dropped.
1617 2018-06-19 13:16:30 Thanks for making it fun to consider equities and stocks as investments Jim. My family watches together sometimes, and my sons AND daughters want their own savings accounts and investment accounts!
1618 2018-06-19 13:15:41 Sep E-mini S&Ps (ESU18 -1.22%) are down -1.09% and Euro #stocks are down -1.07%, both at 2-week lows, as global stocks sell-off on increased trade tensions between the U.S. and China #infotealo
1619 2018-06-19 13:15:39 Domestic benchmark equities ended lower today as US-China trade tensions escalated, weighing down global cues. The market opened almost flat and turned weak as the session progressed. Heavy selling pressure was witnessed in auto, metal and consumer durable stocks.
1620 2018-06-19 13:15:35 ah mid june, or as i like to call it, the best time to buy swimwear from major chains tryna get rid of their summer stocks
1621 2018-06-19 13:15:31 Why list what you won’t invest in.? There’s thousands of stocks/coins I wouldn’t invest in but normal people don’t go around declaring what they won’t invest in. If bgarlinghouse looks like a used car salesman, you look like a used coffin salesman- gtfo
1622 2018-06-19 13:15:17 like i said yesturday, with that big run from $GEVO,, it would kick off other stocks to make major runs,, already $ASTC and $NURO up major,, other will come today
1623 2018-06-19 13:15:00 No surprise. I have been saying for many months now that curve will be flat/inverted before end 2018 and stocks will be hit hard
1624 2018-06-19 13:14:40 Core holdings into summer #i3E #BMN #STAR. Despite a bearish turn in the markets I won’t be reducing these positions. 3 very different stocks but all are underwritten by solid fundamentals & all have significant value accretive events on the horizon.
1625 2018-06-19 13:14:06 Doesnt matter at all.  People down own stocks anymore Dave. A market of index funds. 
SP up 4% , small caps up 11% ytd.
1626 2018-06-19 13:13:57 Do you see 2600 on the S&P soon?  Tech stocks are extended, thus the VIX is low while S&P is weak. Nasdaq is due for a pullback but S&P might hold out better in the selloff, which I tweeted about yesterday urging to short ES and NQ futures, but S&P 2600?  Not sure.

1638 2018-06-19 13:08:00 In months like March and June I m doubling up stock purchase which I do on monthly basis . Instead of new buys focussing on stocks in my portfolio and adding on to strong ones. Trying to be ruthless in cutting the weeds.

2121 2018-06-19 07:22:54 Well, short selling is actually lending someone’s stocks or coins to sell them because you don’t have any of your own. When you cover your shorts, you simply buy them back. So it’s still selling and buying back. Only difference is whether you already have the coins/stocks or not

2128 2018-06-19 07:18:47 We still have a climactic top to go through.  I thought we might get it by summer, but I researched and found out stocks do well into mid term election.  All I know is a big correction is coming, but not a crash.  A bear market in a bull cycle.

2152 2018-06-19 06:58:34 This is nothing more than pressure on stocks. 10% of 200B= 20B equity markets shaved off roughly 300b-500b on that drop. Still could go much lower before going higher.

2155 2018-06-19 06:55:13 Just to make it clear! Trump charging tariffs has zero to do with a black swan unless it is becoming a clash of egos between the two leaders. Right now it is believed that trump has full control and can simply dial back his tariffs if the pressure on stocks is too much.

2159 2018-06-19 06:52:17 I've said this a number of times in the last year, but it's worth repeating. Congressional Republicans & likely some Democrats will give no fucks about trump's antics unless he crashes the stocks market. And no, 32 $ES_F points isn't enough.
2160 2018-06-19 06:51:08 oke but then I get to my main problem. determining targets in advance. How? Cause often hot stocks make new highs.. Picking round numbers is pretty random, L2 doesn't work in advance;). So how can I determine in advance if I can get a 3-1 RR? My experience with swing trading

2189 2018-06-19 06:35:43 The low on the day it gave breakout with heavy volumes was 170.4 So our SL is below that price on CB. The stock has fallen with low volumes indicating profit booking by weak hands. Still safe players can exit considering weak sentiments in small and mid cap stocks

2219 2018-06-19 06:12:48 No-one knows anything but there is nothing suggesting it. Stocks would move first and they're likely in multi year bull, started early 2016. Only 2+ yrs ago.

2222 2018-06-19 06:11:49 Let's be honest, even if only about 12% of US corporate earnings are made abroad that's still something going to be missing sooner or later withing a trade war: how can US stocks disregard everything .... perhaps will be noticing this from now on.

2364 2018-06-19 04:09:02 all metal stocks are recovering. Great call
2365 2018-06-19 04:07:58 Sorry forgot to tell you
2366 2018-06-19 04:07:07 Am I wrong or have I not been reading that there is no scientific evidence that ocean salmon farming poses no threat to wild salmon stocks? If this is so, what is the driving force behind this campaign to eliminate them. The wild salmon fishery?
2367 2018-06-19 04:06:58 Plans changed... Still plan to come your way in a year or two though.
2368 2018-06-19 04:06:49 So you think Crazy Stocks like $IQ $BILI $HUYA $DBX $SOGO... are going to have a big dip ?
2369 2018-06-19 04:06:35 Try to call bottoms on penny stocks. Embarrassing how much money I lost doing that.
2370 2018-06-19 04:05:54 I've just seen too many stocks like this that are already up big and refuse to go down. 50 percent gains are a stretch, but at least 10 is feasible. People were driving up this stock's likely due to FOMO and good news.
2371 2018-06-19 04:05:39 Hi, we keep the stocks  in the books till the time it has some steam left but to all subscribers we provide a trailing stoploss where they can easily sit and hence the money is made near the peaks ... a trailing stop loss is a must in the stock world ...
2372 2018-06-19 04:05:16 Stocks in Asia sink as Trump ups the stakes in China trade fight
2373 2018-06-19 04:04:53 That's because the top tiers are just stupid in general. People don't like bayo because she's perceived to be easy, they're bitter from prepatch, and they don't like stocks being "stolen", but there are many more things that make a character good, and most top tiers have them
2374 2018-06-19 04:03:33 Great entries
2375 2018-06-19 04:03:23 Yeah, you are right with technical for shorter time frame. But I wouldn't do such quick trades in the first place, because when you see rallying stocks like this that open up already at a 20 percent, you just have to sit back and observe for bigger gains.
2376 2018-06-19 04:01:54 The bill I have drafted would restrict any funds other than formal salary, with exception to higher 3 of income prior to election from primary & sole business.  This does not excluse stocks or other means.
Lobbied action would need to be defined to cover nonprofit, vs profit.

2393 2018-06-19 03:49:06 .. “Thus it makes sense to invest in the index stocks in proportion to something like their earnings, not their market caps.” - Howard Marks
2394 2018-06-19 03:48:38 Such sad commentary, victimhood. My good friend cleaned houses and saved her money smart. Was a student of the business and invested in real estate and stocks. She is now a millionaire. She gets it. Anyone can achieve the American dream, most just like to point fingers and blame
2395 2018-06-19 03:47:37 Hi Greg.   Farm-raised salmon is the majority of salmon eaten by people around the world.    Without it there would be considerably more pressure on wild stocks including much more IUU fishing.
2396 2018-06-19 03:47:13 Stocks in index funds are in proportion to their market capitalizations. The big guns are likely to be the higher priced ones. As Howard Marks said “Do you want to put more of your index-money into the more expensive stocks or the ones that are cheaper? I’d rather do the latter.”

2641 2018-06-19 01:20:20 But if you read the whole thing, the big problem is the liquid ETF can sell for less than the underlying stocks.I believe(in context) what he meant in the crunch was that to be able to sell you would do so at a much lower price

2658 2018-06-19 01:10:39 Stocks are not necessarily indicative to market demand. Right now the average person can not afford to go totaly green, fossil fuels are cheaper, more abundent. And more efficient. And being totaly green still is reliant on fossil fuels at this point.
