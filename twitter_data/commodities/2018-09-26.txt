10 2018-09-26 22:53:15 I wondered the same thing. There is also discussion that CEA covers "livestock" w/o delineating all animals. Maybe argument is because there are virtual currency futures therefore all VC are commodities (even w/o evidence of futures in particular VC)?

32 2018-09-26 22:37:34 Espero que não use o preço das commodities somente para justificar o fracasso! Veja quanto era o petróleo, soja, minério de ferro antes de 2002 e no período do PT. E me fale mais sobre a onda econômica mundial!

39 2018-09-26 22:13:12 Not sure if Donald Trump actually thinks the only barrier to a two-state solution is ‘just real estate’ or he only knows how to think in terms of sellable commodities and not years of history and oppression

41 2018-09-26 22:03:19 "One thing is clear - nature does not produce on the one side owners of money or commodities, and on the other, men possessing nothing but their own labor power. It is the result of past historical developments, the product of many economical revolutions." - Marx
42 2018-09-26 22:02:34 Yes there are big family farms, but there are also large corporations that own and gobble up huge acres of farm land to cut out the middle man and basically control the price on crop commodities at the same time
43 2018-09-26 21:56:47 Sadly children are commodities in the business of childcare. Women into the workforce for government and a $value for businesses.

45 2018-09-26 21:50:04 Many commodities are hooked up by the regime's affiliates. Billions of dollars have been embezzled by thieves in the regime. Many domestic products are exported to countries other than the domestic market.

46 2018-09-26 21:28:32 Se depender de Ciro Gomes o PT vai ser o que sempre foi oposição e quando chegou ao poder o que fez foi graças as commodities que é flutuante ao mercado, para mudar tem que reforma os princípios do nosso país. #DebateSBT

50 2018-09-26 20:55:29 Thread: Ladies, we have a sad reality to face. *Some* women TRULY think of themselves -and by implication all of us- as commodities. I'm serious. They are vestiges untouched by feminism. They view life as a business or a game to be won. They feel no sisterhood, only competition.
51 2018-09-26 20:52:11 And the government is working day and night in widening that gap even further by not listening to the cries of its people. When you participate in making laws that increase the prices of basic commodities then the gap will widen. #UNGA
52 2018-09-26 20:46:26 Income producing assets (businesses & real estate etc) have intrinsic value, while non-income producing assets (currencies, commodities & gold etc) don’t.

If the asset doesn’t produce positive cash flows avoid it. 
53 2018-09-26 20:40:03 That’s an interesting take, especially since I didn’t mention the coaches at all.  Hint:  comment on what people actually write/say instead of trying to shade their comments with some weird SJW angle on the marketplace for coaches (proven commodities) vs the players (unproven).
54 2018-09-26 20:35:45 Well we see today's stock gains were FAKE just like today's hack job on commodities. Funny the only winner when the Fed raises rates are bonds (you can't make this stuff up)
55 2018-09-26 20:28:13 Voltamos ao mesmo ponto. Pegas a média de 94 para cá. Vais ver que sim. Quase não cresceu de 79 a 92. O que se chamou década perdida (embora esteja a pôr mais anos na conta). Outro tema. Os crescimentos são pouco sustentáveis, dependentes de fatores externos, como as commodities.

60 2018-09-26 20:01:29 I'd argue that literally every investor today has to be a global investor to understand what's going on - certainly in markets like energy and commodities, but also to take advantage of where we think the best opportunities are going to be.  -- John Burbank

67 2018-09-26 19:44:53 How can a special commodity not be pure gold? Per the contract, It is stated that “AU” metal purity is 92%. Most commodities are on the stock market (world wide price control), this isn’t. If it isn’t pure gold, you can assay it and get pure gold, can you assay Aurum Utalium?

71 2018-09-26 19:17:45 no será que se está muriendo el sistema productivo argentino? (sumado esto al pésimo año de venta de commodities). No será que la devaluación no logra contrarrestar el efecto de tasas de 60% en el costo argentino y que sigue siendo más competitivo importar?
72 2018-09-26 19:16:53 Evening Sir. We are between a rock and a hard place. Prices for basic commodities continue to rise at an alarming rate yet our salaries are still the same. Will it change for the better with this government or it will just get worse?
73 2018-09-26 19:13:49 Ahhh i thought you meant a market that could make decisions, rather than a mechanism for deciding market value of commodities. Although i guess my naive self may believe that news is not a commodity but a social good to enable a healthy democracy!
74 2018-09-26 19:10:55 Es que tampoco es necesario hacer lo mismo que otros países en cuanto a producción.  Si intentamos competir en producción automovilística con Alemania, estamos destinados a fallar.  Exportemos commodities, tecnología agraria, carne, expandamos ese mercado, seamos vivos

80 2018-09-26 18:47:03 My main point was that if you only deduce your assets from a singular locale (maybe you only do blockchain, or ag, or commodities), the end result will be them moving in tandem. You need to garner your picks from all different asset classes.
81 2018-09-26 18:45:36 You misunderstand, corporate brands co-opt movements, dumb it down and render it rudderless only to focus the attention on commodities. So, unity is distilled down to consumer goods. The message here is that the route out of misery is to buy shoes...get it ?

92 2018-09-26 18:09:10 Acabo de comentar el "emprendimiento" del M. de Hacienda con la compra de colegios. Un emprendedor tiene a lo menos 2 distinciones: acciones nuevas y difíciles y riesgos altos. Jugar en la bolsa, comprar  empresas, exportar commodities, el negocio como siempre, es sólo rentista.
93 2018-09-26 18:05:42 Por qué no usas una gráfica de los últimos 20 años en lugar de una tabla? Y, claro, cherry picking. Además, a todos esos países les ha ido bastante mal por la caída en materia prima (que justo comenzó en el 2013), Guatemala produce commodities menos cíclicos.
94 2018-09-26 18:05:30 just saw this -- Arc Rock is right for the most part, and you are in that they are MOSTLY used in spot and futures "commodities" (in the expanded definition of same). "Narrow Indicators" give only a piece of the puzzle. They're often "lagging" indicators, or spillover assets

99 2018-09-26 17:51:21 A3: NAFTA needs to be updated. But just as NAFTA did not cause inequality, killing NAFTA would do nothing to address it. Apparel and furniture are some of the commodities that need to be addressed in the new agreement, for example #expochat

106 2018-09-26 17:38:40 I feel you at this ground!  And funny how It is said that there  is a well economically supported reason behind every national price rise for basic commodities, the former will benefit the gvt and sustain the customer though.
107 2018-09-26 17:36:38 Wrong. The farmers will have no market for their commodities when you are through posturing with their futures.
108 2018-09-26 17:36:38 Do you also trade conventional commodities?
109 2018-09-26 17:35:54 No, well positioned commodities traders will make a fortune when it's over! Farmers will be screwed.

113 2018-09-26 17:21:26 just so you know, women aren't commodities, and before you assume anyone a prostitute boy, better do your research. the subject you skipped on when you were in the academe.
114 2018-09-26 17:16:30 A common man uses 30-40 litres  petrol/diesel maximum monthly. Assuming increase of Rs 10/litre max impact is Rs 300/400 per month which is more than offsetted by control/reduction in prices of many other commodities. So it's not a life threatening issue at all.
115 2018-09-26 17:14:03 I know crypto has opened up trading to many people, but with your knowledge you could have done the same trading metals and other commodities, no?

120 2018-09-26 16:56:10 That what many a hoping for.

However it just increase the price of most commodities.

People don't realize this.

121 2018-09-26 16:55:55 Iran have a advantage of Pakistan. Can import the commodities like wheat, rice  easily aginst lubricant products. India is a major buyer of iranian petrol so the sanctions will not be effective much.

123 2018-09-26 16:39:11 When you play with the global commodities market with tariff games, you get shortages which drive up costs for the middle class.  This is how drug companies get "paid off" for the campaign donations they make.  Simple economics.
124 2018-09-26 16:26:42 Nothing says being a libertarian more than applauding the restriction of the ability to buy lower priced commodities to compete in a marketplace.
125 2018-09-26 16:24:04 They’re all in that same tier. This year Goff has been outstanding no doubt. But Stafford, Luck, and Big Ben are all proven high caliber QB commodities throughout their careers. People were talking up Luck as a potential top 5 QB before his injury. Goff definitely on the rise tho
126 2018-09-26 16:17:10 you see, capitalism is predicated on the idea that labor is a commodity that can be exchanged for other commodities, in this instance money

If you can live averagely and save comfortably on 10-20k per month,I think its fine
134 2018-09-26 15:30:35 Scarcity of money, lack of knowledge and tendency to save leads Indian to resort to such low grade commodities.  But still high ash content coal is used in thermal power plants, which are emitting huge ashes and polluting the environment.

169 2018-09-26 12:37:32 Well the prices of goods and commodities increases. Now don't say ppl below poverty don't consume food.
170 2018-09-26 12:36:08 Lots of those "All star" recommendations went to zero. Numerous people who seemed very good in 2009 and 2010 decided to go all in on commodities and China. Not so smart now.
171 2018-09-26 12:33:12 The problem is that ag commodities are used as political pawns which destroy established markets. A lot of the subsidy is crop insurance which protects the banks from the loan default. Land is also taxed on its production. A low price also means a large drop in revenue.

181 2018-09-26 11:44:11 With unemployment at the record low perhaps promises to create more jobs isn’t what we need? Surely automating rubbish jobs and creating more sustainable commodities should be aim rather than creating jobs as end in itself.
182 2018-09-26 11:41:41 Sim, mas se, para o mesmo argumento, o erro de Lula foi surfar nas commodities, o surf geopolítico de Trunp no "sorriso" de Putin dará uma linda herança maldita para o próximo governo: desdolarização do mundo.

185 2018-09-26 11:30:29 "Everyone is constantly trying to buy at the lowest price and trying to sell at the highest." - that's not necessarily true, only really for commodities.

The only reason to compete in a commodity market is extremely high profit margins. (Or other strategic business advantages).

247 2018-09-26 06:39:41 Sotto: too many missteps but let's focus on the Lupang Hinirang boo-boo. We are in the midst of chaos due to the rice crisis, high prices of basic commodities, high unemployment rate (among other urgent national issues) & he focuses on that? It tells us where his priorities are
248 2018-09-26 06:37:28 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.

252 2018-09-26 06:21:40 That is manifestly untrue. And opinions are not scarce commodities, dispensed like jewels from the over paid ego centric talking heads that are given licence to proselytise on shows like The Drum.

261 2018-09-26 05:57:33 One thing. Reuse, recycling & substitution are great, but the speed at which we need to achieve net-zero emissions, and factoring in growth, especially in the developing world, means we cannot ignore decarbonization of traditional bulk commodities, like steel, cement & plastics.

266 2018-09-26 05:25:18 A lot of the container traffic isn’t even coming into or out of the Burrard Inlet, it’s mostly tankers with other commodities other than oil. An oil tanker is a different boat, wide, sitting low with 650 000 barrels of sludge on board. They have no idea the impact on whales!

269 2018-09-26 05:05:59 Had some verbal tussle with batchmates who are fans of the administration. The funny thing is while still maintaining their praise for the President, they admit having a difficult time with buying basic commodities.

271 2018-09-26 04:56:19 No. I live in Reality. You live in Utopia? Reality is, these Canadian athletes don't really live in Canada, they live in the world outside of Canada using their Canadian Passport. Why would they have to pay taxes where they don't live, hence they don't use the commodities? 1/2
272 2018-09-26 04:51:05 Simple math, if price of commodities are much greater to what the citizens can afford then the government has to step in to rectify the situation.
273 2018-09-26 04:50:07 talaga namang sobrang mahal na ang presyo ng mga basic commodities ngayon! kung nag go=grocery ka, malalaman mo talaga! unless you're super rich at you don't care about the price when you shop!

That's ur export earnings. We survive not bcos of jobs u created but bcos of jobs others created. B thankful.
275 2018-09-26 04:44:41 I actually started trading commodities. We farmed, and I started trading to hedge.

Very first trade was corn, and I  cleaned up. 

Second trade was gold, and I realized that I should have stuck to corn! Lost my butt.

Gold was about $400/oz. Early 1990s

Gold will always be $$.
276 2018-09-26 04:37:39 On line business will increase unemployment. Time to ban on line trading of all commodities.
277 2018-09-26 04:24:10 Sounds like a barter system to me. The commodities are what you can offer to others (with or without money being exchanged). 
Without taxes how do we pay for infrastructure (roads, water treatment plants, etc)?
278 2018-09-26 04:12:46 It is taking time to built...to demolish very less time...make a note of you all... everything weakened...need to properly built.. don't blame Congress...be encouraged to do more for India to reduce all essential commodities...

284 2018-09-26 03:49:07 Second, I think it's totally fitting that she makes the movie as 80's in its sensibilities, focusing on the surface values, the visual commodities. Just as the book for long stretches descends into a litany of catalogue listings, the movie glides like the polished works it apes.

295 2018-09-26 02:32:59 So simple luck then. That said, as usual we have a situation where we have a good opportunity to put commodities wealth into the right places to fund growth while that wealth is there...missing that opportunity just like we did in the mining boom.

299 2018-09-26 02:20:17 There is NO US infrastructure program, and China has just about destroyed their system with fake and excessive credit.  The demand for steel and many commodities will be declining for at least a decade.  Probably more.

308 2018-09-26 01:53:30 I generally don't like restricting choice but don't hate this.

It's a chain.

320 2018-09-26 01:02:00 Think that’s right re: “deeply understand”. Gold and commodities/currencies are uninvestable and thus outside the need of deep understanding for VC.
