Electricity is just energy, right? I don't hear anyone talking about heat or EM field as commodities. So why electricity?

Well no - consumer goods price inflation running > 9% using the unadultered 1980 CPI measure & paperization of the gold and commodities markets prevents for a time proper price discovery.

Fed's actions will vest w/ monetary failure & hyperinflation as Mises predicted.

48 2018-05-31 21:40:41 Oh yeah, for sure. It's the land price, ultimately. The root of all housing evil is the capitalist habit of distributing things that are NOT commodities like land as if they were. We build housing not for USE but rather for SALE. Solution is to decommodify housing.

116 2018-05-31 17:00:03 If @narendramodi  does not focus on 1. Petrol price 2. Putting ppl like vadra sonia sasitarur etc behind bars. 3 black money in foreign bank culprits not jailed 4. Price of essential commodities not controlled. 5. salaried class wage revision esp banks sorted. Consider2019 gone.
117 2018-05-31 16:55:35 Madam the general public esp the rural mass don't understand these figures. For them essential commodities n petrol is what matters. Modiji took the petrol issue lightly. Even v were irritated wth d 1paise decrease. So now the results hv shown u all d mirror.
118 2018-05-31 16:52:34 Não. O governo Lula se sustentou pelo que ELE FEZ com o boom das commodities, como aumentar o salário mínimo para seu maior patamar em 40 anos, gerar 15 milhões de empregos formais, reduzir o percentual da população brasileira que vivia abaixo da linha de pobreza...
119 2018-05-31 16:45:01 Ah sim foi tudo culpa da queda do valor do barril...mas agora q deu uma subida isso não justifica nenhum aumento de preço, certo? Mas quando a direita fala q o Governo Lula só se sustentou por causa do boom das commodities nós estamos falando besteira, certo?

137 2018-05-31 15:44:05 Yes, why were postcards viewed as commodities in comparison to books? I may argue that during that time period postcards were much more andundant than books as they were easier to mass produce and therefore seen as unworthy of study

141 2018-05-31 15:34:32 They must ramp on production, but can’t do so if foreign nations keep dumping cheep commodities into their markets. Is it smart, maybe, will Canada hurt? Not much. Our smelters have not been operating for years either. “Our” steel is a resale commodity from abroad at best

339 2018-05-31 02:06:42 Watching the news is streasing me out, hearing all those millions and billions being put to projects, we dont know if being implemented properly. Aside from news about price hike in gas and other commodities. 
340 2018-05-31 01:54:34 You had me at $4/lb!!  #copper #mining #Commodities
341 2018-05-31 01:44:45 I truly appreciate that. On Twitter, sincerity and courtesy are rare commodities.

Have a wonderful evening.
342 2018-05-31 01:36:18 Shamless buggar childrens are not item to be sold at different MRP at different places, these are your human values, you compare children with a SIP of tea, I am shocked to hear such a comparison.  Basic necessary commodities have price control than why not school ?
343 2018-05-31 00:58:48 We are commodities disco. Our diversity brings our culture and labor for white liberals to enjoy. But we can’t have their power or resources. That’s a no no. 

NY is the state with the most racially segregated schools in the nation.

346 2018-05-31 00:47:52 I went to cash today mostly (HODLing commodities only), and nibbled a short on $SPX. Hope I don't have to chase!
347 2018-05-31 00:39:07 Para esto son los #tarifazos:

-El gobierno paga un precio sostén de U$S 78 el barril de petróleo y U$S 7,50 el millón de BTU de gas
-Los precios internacionales de estos commodities rondan entre U$S 50 y 60 el barril de petróleo y U$S 2,60 el millón de BTU de gas

Esto crítico..
348 2018-05-31 00:34:51 People say there's no jobs but they're kinda shiftin away from the job of payin for their children so children 'emselves have become commodities, sources of income for the undergraduate & Co
349 2018-05-31 00:32:26 Coachella 2019 pass: $429
Car Camping pass: $125

yeah I'm travelling to another country instead

only thing that'll make me change my mind is if the lineup is absolutely amazing
350 2018-05-31 00:32:09 ahora hace asociaciones estrategicas en los recursos naturales, les compran maquinaria a los gringos y les regalamos los commodities a los cubanos como veniamos haciendo con el petroleo, quien carajo le cree a estos malandros?
351 2018-05-31 00:26:03 The way the EU started will do that - I'm quite happy for trading agreements between nations, as long as people are not traded as commodities.
352 2018-05-31 00:24:29 My insurance went up every year before the ACA and has gone up every year since. Health insurance companies get to treat people like commodities because they paid good money for those senators and congressmen they buy.
353 2018-05-31 00:17:27 Poverty reduction cannot be achieved with high cost of basic commodities 
354 2018-05-31 00:16:02 And get a system that takes living ecosystems and turns them into dead commodities for profit, which incidentally is threatening all of us with extinction.
355 2018-05-31 00:12:40 “As destination marketers we don’t promote commodities such as museums, rather our job is to encourage freedom & creativity amongst the people & businesses in our city....” says @BerlinTourism CEO at #MelbourneLIVE2018 @DestMelbourne
356 2018-05-31 00:11:28 @RealNealTapio talks about the trillion dollar deficit, and says South Dakotans are concerned. Wants to re-negotiate trade negotiations. Wants to strengthen trade deals to open up markets for South Dakota commodities. #kelonews
357 2018-05-31 00:04:53 When they are considered commodities?
358 2018-05-31 00:02:19 Humbly requesting the media which is the fourth pillar of our Democracy to educate the citizens to raise their voices against the price rise of petrol... which has a spiral effect on the price of all other essential commodities. Achche Din government is showing their real teeth
