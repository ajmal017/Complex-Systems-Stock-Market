38 2018-08-05 21:25:46 Se assim for, a longo prazo o povo sentirá as consequência desse não investimento na forma de barateamento de commodities (já que o país se reduzirá a exportador disso) e terá que comprar tudo de valor agregado de fora.
39 2018-08-05 21:23:33 china hurts his own country and people more than he hurts the US if he puts tariffs on the agro and commodities like LNG that his country needs for day-to-day life. the people will figure it out then he will have a problem on his hands.
40 2018-08-05 21:14:04 Pq pra criar e manter uma malha ferroviária precisa de muito investimento. Já c Juscelino o transp rodoviario foi priorizado, tb durante a ditadura. C o atual golpe querem o Br como mero exportador de commodities, estrada de ferro pra minério e só, infelizmente.
41 2018-08-05 21:06:32 Cryptos are currently regulated as commodities.

So, nowhere.

44 2018-08-05 20:44:53 Well, I guess that’s our fundamental disagreement. I don’t see health and safety as commodities, I do see them as rights. Not always achieved, but worth striving for. I hope you and your family never have to confront the difference.
45 2018-08-05 20:40:00 Agree. The dollar is to go up which will destroy gold oil and commodities and the Euro will fall
46 2018-08-05 20:22:20 The negative impacts won't be just for a year. China, Canada, EU, Japan, Mexico, are signing 5-7 year contracts. No one in your administration understands commodities markets. TPP has gone on without us. We are now disadvantaged in every market. On you.
47 2018-08-05 20:17:02 First you have never in your life taken even a basic introductory economics course.  You confuse basic terms like commodities, services,  subsidies, and publicly financed.  EPB is publicly owned service, capital is raised via taxpayers, not via investors.
48 2018-08-05 20:12:34 Personally Water will become more precious than all other commodities long before Scottish Oil runs out imho
49 2018-08-05 19:57:03 #NBSTheScore the name SC Villa remains the main attraction to all parties involved (be it Lusaka Commodities or Ltd or whatever other versio)! This may need the key pple that matter (The Fans) to vote on which Villa to go with.. once that's done all the others are dissolved
50 2018-08-05 19:51:21 Youths don't need motivation no more..soften youth fund restrictions, lower the skyrocketed prices of commodities in the market.appoint youths to govt(national &county) offices...let's  start frm there
51 2018-08-05 19:37:02 Fidelity and honesty have become such rare commodities. Everybody just seems to be playing these days and I don't get it. Am I the only one who wants to be someone's only one? 
52 2018-08-05 19:25:15 We have to help them... They need more investors in that country so they can build manufacturing industries, by then they can start exporting commodities to other countries as well as provide Job for their citizens,but is there enough security for investors?
53 2018-08-05 19:25:00 He could well be. His hammy could also go again first game. Never agree selling your best players just an opinion on why it's being talked about. Unfortunately players are commodities nowadays
54 2018-08-05 19:22:27 Los K robaron MUCHISIMO mas de lo que puede haber afando este gobierno hasta ahora. Se fumaron 12 años de precios de commodities por las nubes y dejaron el pais hecho pija, para de repetir boludeces vos
55 2018-08-05 19:17:30 We're going to hit recession a lot sooner than that. China, Europe slowing. US GDP peaking, commodities following China down.  I can't imagine a recession free 2019-2020. Thats one long ass recession till 2025.
56 2018-08-05 19:17:18 I love technicals as one measure for evaluating commodities and stocks because it is the ultimate measure of human psychology.
57 2018-08-05 19:10:10 We are all commodities, we are all whores; some sell their bodies, sone sell their souls #bestthingireadtoday
58 2018-08-05 19:00:27 Rural areas tend to rely more on the production of largely debt-financed fungible goods that are sold into worldwide commodities markets. Urban areas tend to consist more of salaried wage earners employed in firms. Who's more connected to market mechanisms?

60 2018-08-05 18:49:55 Like packages of food being promised towards voters (one of the things I've heard at least) but then there's also stories going out that businesses deliberately create shortages of necessary commodities as to cause an economic crisis and rail against the Maduro government.

65 2018-08-05 18:18:11 Aside from establishing better policies on medical supplies and commodities, the govt should open up more critical care units within the counties. That's where the money drains, not in Outpatient clinic or even day surgeries.
66 2018-08-05 18:14:47 Tenemos que pasar de EXPORTAR MAYORMENTE Materias primas y Commodities a IMPORTAR cada vez MAS Materias Primas y Commodities.

68 2018-08-05 18:02:05 Apple became a global 'cult' ... With semi religious worship of products/ leader 
Tesla is not global by any means. Long way to go. 
Apple has very high margins bc takes generally available cheap commodities and repackages as premium goods (and makes them in China)
69 2018-08-05 17:43:48 Drugs muddle up your self-understanding, you become a mushroom suckling on capitalist commodities.
70 2018-08-05 17:36:16 This  is a day we have been praying  and look forward to, I pray this will bring an end this long suffering. This is blessing Sunday in the #SouthSudan history.  We are expecting president kiir to come together with Dr Riak and prices of commodities to go down.
71 2018-08-05 17:28:45 Now they have sign The is agreement, what is next move? 
Will Dr Riak come to they capital juba with president kiir. 
Will prices of commodities go down in the market? 
Will there be no any unknown gun man targeting pole moving on the road?
72 2018-08-05 17:26:06 One can think that way, and you are entitled to believe this... but the idea that commodities are human rights and should be afforded to everyone doesn’t make it true. A good or service requires payment. That’s how the system is designed to/should work.
73 2018-08-05 17:23:30 No, we're overwhelmed with other work and we don't owe you any further explanation. Do your own research and you'll find out how XTZ will easily be deemed digital security be the SEC. The KYC just adds to that, as digital commodities can't logically be KYC'd.
74 2018-08-05 17:21:56 The unknown can either create fear or unleash opportunity with strategic thinking & positioning for future growth for all companies involved allow future be achieved!  vanadium & mining commodities future is hot especially with EV fundamentals hot @BMRGroupplc @JubileeMetals
75 2018-08-05 17:20:55 changing the name of place in the name of our great saint or freedom fighter is good which senses us feeling pride but we are legging behind in economic sector please look into that sector Check the price rise in daily commodities.
76 2018-08-05 17:06:57 I think it should be ok. I could tell you few funny stories about white(?) American guys got kick out from  the beds by the Asian female doctors.
Another topic for debate.  Asian female doctors are a commodities  or a meal tickets for white guys?
77 2018-08-05 17:06:40 Avoid non trending markets (like forex and commodities), and trade highly directional equities, like your call with Facebook. Then you can just sit back and get stoned as much as you like.
78 2018-08-05 17:02:51 You want to act blindly like they have other means of survival. Even consumers can't buy what's on the shelves cause there's a gap to cover that includes taxes and extra money to acquire forex to import commodities by the PnP or OK
Nivea lotion $5 on the street  $9 in a shop.
79 2018-08-05 16:58:48 Business people are very much interested on selling of our softwood culture like many other commodities & earnt plenty of money but no politician is interested on DEVELOPMENT of this culture till now. Now you are trying to develop it.  Wishing best of luck to softwood artists.
80 2018-08-05 16:29:26 Wow!  Hard to believe he doesn't know how tariffs work.  The importer of record is responsible for duties and taxes.  Any increases get passed in to the consumers.  Prepare for price increases on many commodities. Unreal!

TOPIC: The Commodities Of Heaven

Treasures are things we love, things we have in our heart, thigs your heart crave after. Commodities of heaven are treasures.(col 3:1-3)
82 2018-08-05 16:02:54 It’s not at the expense of American. Some lower end commodities are better off being made in America and we buy them at lower prices. Wanting everything made in America is a dumb idea and would raise prices and make us poorer
83 2018-08-05 15:58:28 Jesus told his disciples to “watch and pray” that they enter not into temptation. Prayer and waiting are inseparable spiritual commodities.

85 2018-08-05 15:48:24 Hay que cambiar el paradigma de desarrollo chileno, hoy básicamente commodities + retail, del que ya no es posible extraer más productividad, a menos de empezar a usar masivamente robots en las minas, comercio, servicios, etc. lo cual por el momento es utopía.  #MesaCentral
86 2018-08-05 15:45:09 @KennethLFisher Just read your article in USA Today and I didn't think there was a bigger liar out there then Trump but I was wrong. There is not always another market out there for one's commodities. What a stupid comment. Come to Indiana and talk with soybeans farmers. Asshat!
87 2018-08-05 15:39:30 Ojo, el boom de commodities no fue mérito de Nestor, y por eso los resultados fiscales y externos mejoraron en TODA Sud-america, no solo en la Argentina. Varios aprovecharon para armar fondos soberanos, como Chile (o Rusia), asumiendo que la bonanza sería transitoria.

91 2018-08-05 14:48:35 This is your problem, you conflate SMV with personal worth. Women reduce themselves to sexual commodities, then get upset when men aren’t aroused by the masculine aspects of themselves that women find attractive in men. Accomplishments don’t make you look any better in a bikini
92 2018-08-05 14:47:32 “...Sometimes aid money is used in the pursuit of geostrategic goals. It can also be a component of policies designed to safe- guard access to commodities or to ensure that refugees do not come to rich nations’ borders.”
93 2018-08-05 14:45:31 It's so pathetic nowadays to work in Kenyan public health facilities reason the county government don't order health commodities on quarterly basis, and bigger part is sidelining the health personnel aka the pharmacist who are the real custodian of drugs
94 2018-08-05 14:03:33 Every week prices on food commodities increase while salaries stay stagnant.
95 2018-08-05 13:31:53 it’s like any other job. we provide a service, we acquire currency from the service(s) we provide. the only difference is that we use our bodies instead of other physical commodities. similar to people who work physical labor jobs.
96 2018-08-05 13:25:56 It is pity that nobody talk about widows and oldage men and women who are only living on their some hundreds  rupees pension for livelihood .Going on increasing gas rates and rates of other essential commodities
97 2018-08-05 13:23:56 All I want to do is plant a seed that changes the way the world and its commodities and animals are seen. To get youngsters asking and finding answers to questions that will to higher quality life.
98 2018-08-05 13:21:55 Tampoco es cierto eso. Fíjate que eso solo funciona para commodities pero cuando se trata de productos Industriales hay otras variables que pueden agregar valor competitivo y ganar Mercados. Ahora si, esto nunca es posible partiendo de una matriz fiscal de saqueo sistemático
99 2018-08-05 13:21:11 As postal as a commodities
100 2018-08-05 13:20:33 Arrecadação não tem como crescer acima do crescimento do PIB indefinidamente, como foi nos anos do boom das commodities. Até podemos ter a sorte de esse boom voltar e nos dar mais uns anos, mas o crescimento do gasto (obrigatório, principalmente) tb precisa ser tratado
101 2018-08-05 12:55:08 conozco al escritor de la nota. no lo hacen con maldad eh, lo hacen sin entender nada mas. es lógico, festejan la diversidad de commodities de lujo para ellos. No ven lo que pasa abajo o les chupa un huevo...
102 2018-08-05 12:49:17 Holy shit! Patrick remembered government cheese under Reagan. Good. We’re getting there. Do you remember commodities AFTER Reagan? I hope not because that would mean hallucinations bc REAGAN scrapped PIK. Making progress. 
103 2018-08-05 12:47:15 Oh yeah, are you selling a lot of stocks, bonds, commodities? It’s another debt financed give away to the rich. So much for ‘the forgotten man.’
104 2018-08-05 12:46:38 better course would be to encourage local production by providing the facilities. Once the products (comparatively cheap) enter the market, the people will automatically shift to local commodities thereby reducing imports.
105 2018-08-05 12:36:45 There is sad fact in LatinAmerica. The Andes Countries from Colombia to Bolivia live from the drug. This is the most profitable farm and commodities.. Like Afganistan. The other countries are used for distribution and banks. Center America is a human traffic business.
106 2018-08-05 12:32:18 Why would they tell the truth?  Have you missed the Brexit negotiations?  Scotland doesn't already qualify, other as part of this UK.
Oil is a commodity. Economies dependent upon commodities are very vulnerable.

110 2018-08-05 11:33:43 For sake of argument if they were raised and killed humanely it wouldn't. But the prob with factory line commercialisation is that it almost always puts profits above all else. Animals looked at & treated as commodities.

with lyrics like this, how do modern women expect men to not see women as commodities?
112 2018-08-05 11:07:22 And what's frightening is that the era of commodities is coming to an end.but Africa hasn't found anything to replace that dwindling income derived from commodities.
113 2018-08-05 11:06:50 This is so frightening. How can a government treat their young people as disposable commodities? Please @cnnbrk @CNN @BBCBreaking @AlJazeera shed light on the atrocities that’s happening in Bangladesh
114 2018-08-05 10:55:01 Reads like a fascist. ‘Dumping’ people as if they were commodities. Dehumanising people.
115 2018-08-05 10:36:40 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
116 2018-08-05 10:35:14 Most people on Earth live in a “Poor” country and its even worst for them.  But if you allow people to acquire HUGE wealth quickly, they will find a way to expand the amount of commodities in the world. #tpesa
117 2018-08-05 10:29:55 People are not commodities and shouldn't be treated as such.
118 2018-08-05 09:59:00 Only twice in last 40 years has Scotland received more than we put in, anyway just ask yourself this question if we're such a burden on the UK purse why hang on to Scotland that will never happen in the short term until such commodities are depleted,
119 2018-08-05 09:53:34 The EU grew out of the European Coal and Steel Community. The reason these commodities were chosen is because they were the main ingredients in building military power. The purpose was to ensure the Ruhr could never again be used to power a military machine.

121 2018-08-05 09:08:58 Basic commodities.
122 2018-08-05 08:43:54 Talking about agri commercialization, i think Nepal should focus more on meeting domestic consumption first than to promote for export market. Free trade policies can be strengthened for commodities having comparative advantage rather than following free trade route
123 2018-08-05 07:42:14 Either way, the UK is in for a hit, and as usual the people at the bottom will be hit first. Then follows the fire sale of whatever public commodities remain.

126 2018-08-05 07:03:54 I do agree that it works as a framework for the movement of commodities.  Since the zeitgeist is focused on currencies, lets switch the narrative from "is EU" to "is opposite of EU".  I agreed with you & the latter before, but suddenly realized that the opposite is more true.

128 2018-08-05 06:44:59 People are grabbing land because they want not because of the upward development in real estate. The world over people are investing in properties but they are not grabbing. Secondly we will build the factories but who will buy the commodities? Where is the money?
129 2018-08-05 06:38:19 No, not 10 times. Inflation under 5% is productive for the economy. Inflation was about 10%+ during UPA 1 and 2 and that's why you are reporting such prices. Check the prices of commodities from 4 years back. Not much difference is there.
130 2018-08-05 06:37:12 Money, these girls are just commodities in this battle against poverty
131 2018-08-05 06:34:15 Are you aware that prices of food and other essential commodities have gone out of the hands of the lowly?
132 2018-08-05 05:55:40 I still don't think it's right, regardless.  Girls and women are not commodities to be traded by men.  I'm not a "feminist", but I'm not a chauvinist, either.  Things have to change worldwide.
133 2018-08-05 05:54:30 What website do you use for trading commodities?
134 2018-08-05 05:53:57 If there are no commodities attached to them then they aren't depriving anyone of anything.
135 2018-08-05 05:52:59 Lol, no - Obviously you can hoard wealth. In addition to bitcoin, gold, art, real estate, bank accounts that are backed by mortgages are also stores of wealth that don't result in commodities being produced.
136 2018-08-05 05:50:25 Commodities can only rise when producers are surprised by wrong hedging positions. So, we will get a spike in natgas, because producers have hedged at low prices. So natgas will spike and companies will plunge. This is exactly why oil companies plunged despite high oil price.
137 2018-08-05 05:41:33 Yes, so easy! I mainly got everything off LTD Commodities. :-) I had a friend tell me about it.
138 2018-08-05 05:39:13 It looks like a tri state commodities truck honestly
139 2018-08-05 05:36:54 A lot of tact and tics has already been appended but there is no improvement seen in the prices of commodities despite the govt's claim, tax collection since GST has increased.
140 2018-08-05 05:31:40 Why are women treated as commodities ? Hope @ndtv @republic take this issue for prime time discussion ?
141 2018-08-05 05:09:46 Capitalism thrives on your addiction, it thrives on your weakness in the face of its tantalizing, poisonous, commodities.
142 2018-08-05 05:04:27 Africa should be looking for ways to add value and process our commodities. Our dream should be to sell chocolate not cocoa, to export cloth not cotton and cosmetics. Of we could just produce a moderate product which can be bought by a middle class European. #theafricandream
143 2018-08-05 04:49:24 You may want to look at how commodities are harvested to build electric car batteries.  It's not an environmentally friendly solution.
144 2018-08-05 04:34:23 It's also about nurses' anxieties and abuse. Wouldn't you love to have your hands tied to a bed indefinitely? No rapport allowed with commodities
145 2018-08-05 04:08:06 yeah and so do people liberals and people who talk about culture and cultural appropriation like they’re static bounded commodities
146 2018-08-05 03:24:46 There's nothing revolutionary about doing drugs, they make you addicted to capitalist commodities.

151 2018-08-05 02:41:53 Mr.Kejriwal why Minimum wages to be fixed when all commodities prices are market driven?
why not pay should not be on the basis production or output basis? My 40y work experience told me every person has different out put for the same job why this disparity.
152 2018-08-05 02:37:54 Michael McWho????   If he cared anything about continued proper use of sheep & cattle as valuable resources and saleable commodities he'd be right up there pushing the ideas of local slaughter, local processing & high quality shipping of meat. But where is he? Who is he?
153 2018-08-05 02:06:47 @PeterSchiff In 1974 the CRB was worth 3.48 times the SPX.  Today it is worth 6.8%  of the SPX.  IOW, in 1974 commodities were worth 51 times as much as they  are today relative to stocks. 

I know you know this, but I just wanted to throw it out there.  I just wanted to say it.

Ou
2)Um mero exportador de commodities desindustrializado e sem pesquisa e inovação.

214 2018-08-03 20:24:21 This reminds me of one contributing cause of the 1980 farm crisis. People bought lands because of inflation. 7% a year. eventually prices for commodities collapsed and there were too few$ to pay of loans. We repeat this same story in other areas over and over.
215 2018-08-03 20:23:37 Corporations have no idea how to create commodities because the sale of the product is always for their profit, which makes it a security.

224 2018-08-03 19:41:29 It should be compulsory for farm traders, grain forwarders merchants, buyers , farmers , farm managers to spend a week in a bulk transport office & on the road with drivers to experience the frustrations involved moving commodities from one place to another let alone on time !
225 2018-08-03 19:32:06 When a party is anti-union they are not pro-worker or pro wage increases. It’s not immigrant vs. citizen, it’s about rich vs. poor. If you believe your boss that you’re a commodity, then you are one. Commodities don’t need health care, child care, or education. You’re a fool.

241 2018-08-03 18:30:48 I'm at work now. Labor is a commodity from a business perspective. As with all commodities, a shortage of it increases it's relative value. Oversupply, (think open borders and outsourcing), devalues it. If Wal-Mart gets 100 applicants for every position? What if nobody applied?
242 2018-08-03 18:26:09 Zimbabwe is such an unbelievable country, while political parties are fighting over elections,retailers have increased prices of goods over night even the most basic commodities have gone up. I think I can't keep up with this country, it's draining my livelihood. I can't anymore
243 2018-08-03 18:24:26 That's because conspiracies are cheap commodities. They take zero investment.
244 2018-08-03 18:17:31 Peace doesn’t let you control the Opium & other drugs. Three most profitable commodities - oil, weapons, & drugs. When asking why about our foreign policy, one of these is usually the answer.

255 2018-08-03 17:41:17 Money itself is not real. The Value in money is what it was traded for (Commodities, Assets, etc). Money is  a group of numbers that is use to scale the value of what we buy or sell.
256 2018-08-03 17:40:12 Time is one of the most precious   and limited commodities allotted to man.Because it is so important, it behaves us to use time wisely.
257 2018-08-03 17:37:54 @LukeGromen sums up what’s going on here very well. FED wants a strong USD... to maintain global reserve status even if it means killing risk assets. I recommend reading Luke’s material, very smart guy with a great view of the world of currencies & commodities!
258 2018-08-03 17:25:41 through technology, the internet and satellite systems that connect the globe on a 24/7 basis. It is the pursuit of free-market principles whereby supply and demand, including money, minerals, resources and rich commodities, is governed by advertising, marketing and, 2/3
259 2018-08-03 17:22:23 That’s because they are beholden to shareholders and the principle of profit maximization. How else would owners be incentivized to build businesses? And jobs. Workers are commodities. Wage is a function of supply and demand.
260 2018-08-03 17:18:34 One way China can destroy the US is by halting shipments of rare earth materials to the US. If tariffs go beyond an extended timeframe China may and could use the rare earths which would halt production in the US to a standstill. #china #us #rareearths #xijinping #commodities
261 2018-08-03 17:14:48 I suspect our ability to purchase will depend on him making a certain number of appearances and the price will increase depending on that number. Players as commodities to be speculated on. Not great for the game tbh.
262 2018-08-03 17:14:33 Yeah I'd challenge that. They lost some value. And they're volatile but so are commodities
263 2018-08-03 17:13:44 Indeed, but Goldman et al tend to tell you it's not currency.

Existing crypto right now functions as a speculative asset on will these web 3.0 platforms gain traction.

Longer term they could be something else

They can behave like payments, securities, commodities +++
264 2018-08-03 17:12:26 Given MySpace, what problem did Facebook solve? Given Facebook, what problem did Instagram solve? Cryptocurrencies are superior to currency, commodities, and bank wires in some ways and inferior in others. Apparently its particular blend of trade offs has value.
265 2018-08-03 17:02:42 I wish there could be a medium. Like updating the older homes or something. I'm all for modern commodities but I'm in love with the architecture and history in those homes 
266 2018-08-03 16:56:48 The symmetary with AUD now testing 2014-2015 support line is awesome. So many parallels with the commodities / China / Eurodollar crisis back then. 

But I still think we need to see oil lower before $ can really get going (and the cycle begins). Everyone is so underprepared.

276 2018-08-03 15:49:33 I wish you good luck with this, but remember these guys do not work for shareholders, but for bankers and they want commodities down whatever it takes. Options are much better.
277 2018-08-03 15:39:27 So what? Do you really think these commodity prices are going to stay low forever? There is a shortage coming for all commodities and an inflation spike to follow that is going to drive oil, gas, gold, silver, copper and many more commodities soaring. Investing for the long term.
278 2018-08-03 15:36:36 Seems like you are interested in Forex?

There is a huge correlation between the Forex market and the Commodities & the Equity markets.

We should all pay particular attention to the Forex, trading $SPX

Especially, $USDJPY -> $SPX risk-on

$USDCNH -> $GOLD & $Silver. risk-off

281 2018-08-03 15:31:07 Commodities have industrial demand and stocks have yield...
282 2018-08-03 15:28:57 That happens when one buys too many commodities & create too much overcapacity - BTW it’s not a positive outcome as you continue to propagandize

China has to store, maintain, pay interest, & use all these assets. they dont have the ability to sustain spending required to do so
283 2018-08-03 15:28:15 causes more misery and murder each other as buyer and sellers of commodities. As vectoral production develops, the means for struggling
284 2018-08-03 15:25:39 The majority of people who fail to accumulate money sufficient for their needs are, generally influenced by the opinions of others.
Opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth.
If you are influenced by opinions when you reach decisions, you will not succeed.

285 2018-08-03 15:24:09 Yes, it is. The stock market is only one metric for measuring economic health, not the be-all-end-all sign of prosperity or failure, and is nonetheless still a market and subject to bubbles just like housing and commodities.
286 2018-08-03 15:21:38 Africans learn to build ur own home ....Africans stop being cheap commodities in the western and Asia  market .....Africans, Africa have everything in this world ....Africans  don't be the son of  betray and hypocrisy in ur mother land
287 2018-08-03 15:21:21 Food/drink brands are much stickier than other commodities. People don't have strong memory associations with their batteries.

290 2018-08-03 15:02:09 Yes majority of ppl treat animals as commodities really they don't get the respect they deserve
291 2018-08-03 14:58:14 Green, there is and always will be a cost to maintain that status, whether it is traffic or household goods commodities. The goal you have set up is costing the poor of this country dear, rising prices to parking and speed restrictions (harmful exhaust gases ) deselect yourself.
292 2018-08-03 14:55:49 So the trade war with China is about to escalate with new tarrifs from China. As huge amounts of commodities pile up in wearhouses with no place to go, and prices drop, maybe this trade war is not won so easily. We'll see, believe me!!!

304 2018-08-03 14:08:13 When a selloff starts in the bond market while there's a simultanous selloff in the stock market that is not abating, all that cash is going to go into commodities - gold, silver. Get it now while it's real CHEAP. Buy cash.  What the gov. don't know they can't steal.

308 2018-08-03 13:43:41 I see crypto acting as the new age commodities market. Much like how gold and silver begin to rise when stocks pull back and vice versa. Data and information are the commodities of tomorrow. @APompliano thoughts on this? $btc $eth $ltc
309 2018-08-03 13:37:25 Miami Dade animal shelter is a beautiful place.  However, placing animals in a store front window looks more like commodities than living beings.  Its appalling.  Obviously, the designer is not an animal lover.
310 2018-08-03 13:36:52 Couldn’t miss that BS if I tried. If all the products and commodities will be sold off to other countries then explain the need for $12Billion in farm subsidies.
Supply and demand is a very simple equation. Even if we had other buyers, losing China is still reducing demand/price.

316 2018-08-03 13:22:49 There's an interesting contrast between commodities and equities. In commodities, rising prices reduce demand/falling prices boost demand. In equities, rising prices boost demand/falling prices reduce demand!

334 2018-08-03 12:22:37 Maybe a few are wondering where to go with the commodities. I gave a recycling man the best way to understand the prices. They are valued in dollars.

360 2018-08-03 08:16:03 im sorry but you have to look at the bigger picture here because either way people will die, if we wait for the next 5 years people will die from the lack of basic commodities like food.
361 2018-08-03 08:15:08 Hay 18 productos griegos cuyas exportaciones han incrementado un 70% desde 2009, que representan el 30% de las mismas y que explican lo ocurrido con la Balanza Comercial. Entre ellas se encuentran commodities (mármol, aceite, aceitunas, …,) y transformados (yogur, helado, …,).
362 2018-08-03 08:14:12 Academics are market-oriented intellectuals whose goal is to turn all human potential into capitalist commodities.
363 2018-08-03 08:07:46 Nonhuman animals are NOT products, they are not commodities, they are sentient individuals and their lives belong to them. And there is NO humane way to kill somebody who does not want to die.

380 2018-08-03 06:44:19 It is not about being rich, all humanity requires is to produce products as a means of livelihood. In the process what is produced is exchanged as commodities in a market place. This is the model of development -what should concern us is the social differentiation that results.
381 2018-08-03 06:37:35 We have witnessed rocketing prices of basic commodities
382 2018-08-03 06:34:27 The corporate definition of love is obsessed with commodities, property, and hoarding of things and experiences.

389 2018-08-03 05:20:15 How is it helping the US when commodities are increasing because the price of steel is increasing. Perhaps if you are in the steel business then congrats to you.
390 2018-08-03 05:19:15 I wonder if anyone truly imagined anything or had d capacity or inclination. It has all along , MPD or not, been a classic case of vested interests driven construction juggernaut with commonsense, city’s interests & ecosystem treated as dispensable commodities.
391 2018-08-03 05:00:01 Commodities: Rice -1.68%, Rubber -0.92%
392 2018-08-03 04:45:26 Bullshit.  The price of steel is on the rise and almost every economic sector is about to see higher prices on basic commodities and components.  Those rising costs from a less efficiently economy (thanks to artificial trade barriers and tariffs) will slow the economy.

406 2018-08-03 02:46:19 And I'm saying that the opposite is true of Chile. It had economic success, there was a political and human price, there was meddling (by the US and the USSR), there was policy imposed by force and, in both cases, the price of commodities tells a lot of the story.

417 2018-08-03 01:09:13 AUD/USD should be below 0.7000, interest rate differentials, lower commodities and a much weaker CNH all point lower. Lot of time spent in the range 0.7300-0.7500 mean the eventual break will be nasty.

Truth of the matter is we were and are still living in very patriarchal societies revolving around men rights and ego. While women are seen as commodities to be had nd dispose
466 2018-08-04 20:43:16 i'm having trouble decoding all that lol  

i just know that women don't always want to be around men, and we should have the freedom not to be when we so choose. seen as sexual commodities, trophies, and competitive bragging rights of men, women must be protected.

474 2018-08-04 20:12:08 These figures might be lower in Q3 and Q4. Many companies stockpiled goods and commodities in June, before the tariffs.
475 2018-08-04 20:09:40 Essa é nossa sina enquanto nação: nos encantarmos com a ignorância. Lula foi presidente, iletrado, analfabeto, surfou um boom de commodities sem precedentes, e serviu de modelo de malemolência ao povo: ñ estude, ñ se prepare, e “vença” na vida. Macunaímico nosso destino.
476 2018-08-04 20:03:47 Cube Entertainment stock prices dropped because of the news (apparently), which makes me really sad and bothered because in the end it shows that k-pop stars are commodities for the fans who consume their content
477 2018-08-04 19:57:59 Yes ,l am mourning,wondering ;people are so scared of change in 2018!!!!Zanu has Been controlling our lives for 38 years.What could change now?95% unemployment,cashless,basic commodities expensive the list is endless...

479 2018-08-04 19:37:45 Drugs do not relax you, they turn you into a consumptive addict who relies on commodities to remain socially functional.
480 2018-08-04 19:18:22 So horrible to kick the poor birds like that no care no respect nothing they are just commodities.
481 2018-08-04 18:57:11 In other words, imo China is simultaneously strengthening CNY via gold/commodities, & weakening it vs USD so as to not crush its economy in the process. While USD system predominates, USD appears strong, but strength fades as CNY is increasingly needed for phys gold/commods.
482 2018-08-04 18:53:47 Sad...where’s the “family” and “fatherly” support for Jalen now they preached when recruiting him? Colleges,coaches, fans & NCAA treat these kids/student-athletes like commodities. Sadly, they get duped. So many coaches just flat out lie & are self-serving. Again, sad for Jalen.
483 2018-08-04 18:43:16 Jillian Michaels the commodities sales agent is getting robbed by Adam Sandler but is abducted and probed by Marco.
484 2018-08-04 18:40:55 It is still challenging, due to frequent stockouts and high demand for injectable and implants which has led to some health service providers selling those commodities . Thus limiting women access to such FP commodities.  #srhrdialogues , #sdgs3 ,#sdgs #Liberia
485 2018-08-04 18:38:26 China does not want a trade war. All their actions are/will be in commodities. They don't want to look weak either.
486 2018-08-04 18:37:58 Definitely looks like one. Wouldn't be surprised to see more strength in the sector (usually does well late-cycle along with commodities). $NTR
487 2018-08-04 18:37:15 Destaco também o comunista Conti, que acha que vender commodities e terras produtíveis a chineses é a mesma coisa.
488 2018-08-04 18:29:22 Thems is commodities they won't be cheap either.  Long as salmon isn't too expensive I need my salmon
489 2018-08-04 18:26:42 This Buhari administration is excessively stupid and intellectually bereft! 

Your banned some basic commodities and mandated people to use "made in Nigeria". But, you fly overseas for medical check ups... oh! #NigeriaAir logo was designed by a company abroad! Hypocrites. B gd.
490 2018-08-04 18:24:48 Derrubaram uma presidente eleita para ROUBAR  grande parte DOS TRILHÕES DE DÓLARES em commodities , minerais e óleo, do Brasil, mantendo o brasileiro na miséria
491 2018-08-04 18:18:41 Some of the key challenges in Liberia for SRHR promotion in the work we do are frequent stock out of #SRH commodities, limited staff capacity to provide youth friendly #SRH services. Limited political will and commitment to addressing #SRH.
492 2018-08-04 18:08:19 1. FWIW, I haven’t seen anything/proof on how Bakkt is going to be a “regulated custodian.” Where can I find specs? 2. In the commodities world, cash-settled futures were an innovation on physically settled futures. In practice almost everyone rolls futures/doesn’t take delivery.
493 2018-08-04 18:02:21 Y lo acomulado en la época dorada de los commodities 
494 2018-08-04 17:56:49 enough #wewantjustice now go back to your class,general people are suffering too much,the price of every commodities is high,govt has accepted everything,so there is no need to do any movement #bangladesh
495 2018-08-04 17:48:05 No rice at shops...daily essential commodities are running out of stock...we will die in hunger soon ...
496 2018-08-04 17:45:55 Lo unico que permitio tantos años de choreo fue el precio de las commodities, fue soja, choreo y suerte

Shamshar Singh, the jailer of Hisar jail, deducts the grains coming out of Dhiya's house and sells the commodities coming out at an expensive price. The Haryana Government has made a jiler for the person who snatches the money from the mouth of the poor.
498 2018-08-04 17:37:31 Non intrusive NATO alliance and liberal (multilateral) weakening.  This will facilitate a strengthened Russian position by allowing unilateral nation-on-nation commodities trading/ particularly their energy sector and raw materials.
499 2018-08-04 17:32:29 Senador, sou grande admirador do seu trabalho. Mas o PT não é o grande contribuidor das políticas sociais, o MAIOR contribuidor das políticas sociais são : PLANO REAL E BOOM das COMMODITIES. Nada mais.
500 2018-08-04 17:11:18 Otro dato muy importante es que durante el gobierno kirchnerista, en materia energética estábamos saqueados, por lo que nos veíamos obligados a importar energía, gas, etc. Mientras el valor de las commodities disminuía y el valor del petróleo seguia aumentando, el déficit crecía
501 2018-08-04 17:08:28 La exportacion argentina se basa mayoritariamente en commodities. Actualmente los precios de las mismas rondan aproximadamente en la mitad de lo que valían hace unos años, por lo que por más que se quiten retenciones, se baje el gasto, etc. La ganancia sigue siendo menor.
502 2018-08-04 16:50:27 O principal motivo da proibição da cannabis é econômico. Com baixos investimentos, gera muitos recursos, e isso desagrega valor às demais commodities. A prova é que existem variedades sem efeitos recreativos, que também são proibidas (veja Adidas Hemp). Traria muito lucro ao país
503 2018-08-04 16:33:11 acho que sim ali em 2002: commodities subindo e ibov caindo com o medo de Lula ganhar. Depois a cartinha aos brasileiros resolveu tudo. Caso Ciro apareça com chances reais de ser eleito pode acontecer de novo, mas no todo o gráfico é bem fiel.
504 2018-08-04 16:24:03 Eddie Murphy staring into the camera when being explained commodities by the Duke Brothers should have killed all white people on the spot.
505 2018-08-04 16:23:02 O se ka hoga??? Ka Mughal sarai Ki janta ko petrol, diesel aur LPG sasta milega ??? Price of all essential commodities will be reduced ??? Keya rozgaar ka avsar barh jaayega.
Pooja, Mandir Darshan, aur Naam karan Ki gandi rajniti band karo.
506 2018-08-04 16:20:23 Não esqueço disso Você sabe que o imperialismo que o monopólio para controle global isso não inclui só commodities incluir política tambem eles não querem democracia estado independente. Infelizmente o Brasil sofre Sabotagem até no sistema financeiro!
507 2018-08-04 16:13:10 Even the most overtly political works of art can simultaneously, as commodities, participate in the reproduction of the structural inequities they profess to condemn. The author is a producer.
508 2018-08-04 16:05:22 @PMOIndia, due to floods in the country,absence of National Chracter of wholesale & Retail Traders, have created Artificial shortage though no shortages. Prices of all commodities jacked up from 30% to 50%. Government must initiate action
509 2018-08-04 15:59:30 We can't really just blame people now, we've been felling, mining, scarring forever...but Capitalism and Neoliberalism make everything commodities, all our 'growing economies' pushed us to these extremes
510 2018-08-04 15:59:00 Sim, mas pq grande parte da nossa bolsa e commodities e banco... 

Mas da economia não...
511 2018-08-04 15:58:34 And words can either rip the wonder right out of life or glorify and enhance it... precious and dangerous commodities are our words.
512 2018-08-04 15:56:32 Yeah me too. It’s terrible. They are pulling us back to Dickensian class system of wealthy and poor.  And actually it’s very easy to change.   The answer is a tax system that is fair for society. Seeing the country a d it’s people as a family. Not commodities.
513 2018-08-04 15:52:21 No he is using reglone, it's harder to sell commodities when desiccated with glyphosate since public opinion drives our buyers demands.
514 2018-08-04 15:52:12 From Clive onwards most  British are crooked  commodities for sale.
515 2018-08-04 15:48:36 Hm that’s puzzling I mean I doubt people would lie about what happened so I guess some sort of misunderstanding occurred... I’ve never bought fan goods but I really want some jjong ones ugh im literally entrenched in useless commodities and capitalism But I Want My Jjong
516 2018-08-04 15:43:50 No sé si llegaste al planeta hace poco, pero Argentina exporta commodities y sus derivados, y el 100% del crecimiento del PBI se explica x el aumento en el precio de los mismos.
El Kirchnerismo sólo hizo todo lo posible p/disminuir ese crecimiento, vía impuestos a las exportac.
517 2018-08-04 15:40:33 Às vezes teve má vontade em entender as ideias dele. No contexto geral ele disse tudo que eu espero de um presidente: mais incentivo ao livre mercado, agregar valor às commodities , privatização, flexibilização de leis trabalhistas, desburocratização, investimento em segurança
518 2018-08-04 15:32:16 What a waste of money- could have been avoided if the council would only face the fact that strip clubs are incompatible with gender equality as they involve treating women as sex objects, commodities that can be bought.

RICO incentives of Glass Cage DoD subcontractors (Americo Montañez Padilla et al) need be terminated, e.g:

* holding of stocks & commodities -- EVEN under blind trusts

-- as thru P/ME they CONTROL markets behavior.
520 2018-08-04 15:30:13 Wall Street controlled commodities
521 2018-08-04 15:26:41 Mas ele disse ontem: mais incentivo ao livre mercado, agregar valor às commodities , privatização, flexibilização de leis trabalhistas, desburocratização, investimento maciço em segurança, aproximar o Brasil dos grandes players no mundo: EUA e Europa, etc. Você não viu isso?
522 2018-08-04 15:14:00 Excellent analysis in @barronsonline , by one of the best commodities journalists.  Buy futures to be able to afford coffee.
523 2018-08-04 14:57:55 Queria saber se algum dia entrevistaram a Dilma ou o Lula dessa forma. Imagina se Lula não tivesse surfado na década das commodities. Quem dera pudéssemos fazer um upload do conhecimento do Paulo Guedes na cabeça do Bolso.
524 2018-08-04 14:55:30 #China’s proposal to add a new round of tariffs on $60 billion worth of goods it imports from the U.S. — retaliation for expanding planned tariffs by the #Trump administration — is only hitting one commodities sector hard: liquefied natural gas shipments.
525 2018-08-04 14:42:58 Merely wishing for others that was very quick and commodities like the bad to karaoke on handling them i'm home aldry since 2008. I can
526 2018-08-04 14:40:47 Is there truly any economic growth? Aside the fraudulent ones reported by government agencies like the NBS?  The true growth must reflect in the real consumer index and prices of commodities in the market and increase in job creation.
527 2018-08-04 14:40:24 The tragic steps of an "I" Gov't they loose their moral/ethical core and see $$, convenience, citizens are only consumers and commodities. When they stop being those two "things" then they're dispensed with..."Me-Myself-I" the worlds Triune god.  Gov't of Netherlands.
528 2018-08-04 14:36:31 As long as there are enough dumb investors , commodities will be staying low forever. This is exactly the strategy of the crooks. We need a shareholder revolt.
529 2018-08-04 14:33:09 Facts & evidence that are important for the public certainly threaten you. Chemical use is used in all ag commodities, even organics. Why do you fight so hard to deny the public having this important information? Sure looks like you have something dangerous to hide!
530 2018-08-04 14:19:43 If you do have insurance you are still screwed. It's a sad joke!
The fact that the same procedure has different prices based on who is paying, shouldn't be legal. We aren't talking about commodities and volumes, these are people's lives!
531 2018-08-04 14:07:56 A Austrália é atrasada por depender tanto qto de commodities?
532 2018-08-04 13:45:44 Your fear of life without drugs leads you to fear a future without capitalist commodities.
533 2018-08-04 13:36:08 No it's more a lifecycle portfolio with a "twist": I also believe bonds are currently overpriced so I have an underweight in bonds and an overweight in cash. I will probably keep 5% in commodities for now
534 2018-08-04 13:33:41 Do you take tactical asset allocation positions? 
IMO, we are in the Biz cycle that commodities rally. And Corp bonds are at spread tights so not paying in terms of risk/reward.
535 2018-08-04 13:30:54 It costs money to recover and recycle all commodities so less plastic would be better than trying to get people to recycle, granted there is a revenue from recovered materials but the quality parameters and volatility of the market have a huge impact, just stop so much packaging.
536 2018-08-04 13:26:44 Never thought that this day will come when gross things are sold as hot commodities.....
537 2018-08-04 13:13:21 Which would open up the rail line to ship other products such as grain and lumber and other commodities which would boost the Canadian economy.

539 2018-08-04 13:02:38 it's remarkable, pernicious even, how media analysis/criticality theory has gone from a means to analyze society through the lense of its cultural output, to yet another a shallow means by which one attempts to divine the value of art objects as cultural commodities
540 2018-08-04 12:58:31 In reality it should or will be more since the production of commodities requires oil or oil derivatives and natural gas.
541 2018-08-04 12:40:50 The Dems sure as fucked loved Assange when he exposed the Bush war crimes. If they weren't so corrupt, they wouldn't be bitching about their own corruption being exposed. 2 parties, 1 goal, and we don't figure in their plans, except as commodities to be used and discarded.

543 2018-08-04 12:21:13 The key to progressing in life is not focusing on the acquisition of superficial commodities, but adopting practices which nurture your spiritual ascension. 
544 2018-08-04 12:19:17 Não é bem isso q o gráfico mostra. OGX teve proteção e quebrou. O gráfico mostra o impacto das commodities nos lucros das cias em conjunto. 

Mas vc tem total razão no capitalismo de compadrio que NÃO começou com o PT... apenas foi reforçado.
545 2018-08-04 12:15:01 All of the corporate M&A dueling being contrary to the idea of a “loyalty” program. (Particularly if the loyalty of lifetime 2 million SE members is among the commodities being horse-traded!)
546 2018-08-04 12:14:23 You know you're right, it's a country where it's each man for himself and in that desperation there are no rules. It's  a toxic mix of narcissistic canabal masculinity and that's the reason why women and children aren't respected in this country, they're relegated to commodities.
547 2018-08-04 12:02:03 Discordo. Que confusão. 1o pq em nossa economia as commodities são apenas, 6,4% do PIB . 2o pq não tem nada a ver economia correlacionada com commodity como sendo consequência de maus políticos. Olha a Austrália q tem contribuição de commodities na economia e vc vai entender.
548 2018-08-04 11:40:01 Fácil falar que ele tirou o Brasil da fome qdo na vdd ele "surfou" no crescimento da China de 10% do PIB,aproveitou com os benefícios das commodities e como se isso não bastasse,se utilizou das estatais para se perpetuar no poder. Agora não passa de um condenado inelegível.
549 2018-08-04 11:37:31 that 4% was impacted by preordering of items such as pork and soybeans which will be impacted by tariffs, soybean orders were more than doubled and future qtrs will reflect reduced sales in commodities affected by those tariffs, so pack away the confetti
550 2018-08-04 11:31:42 Another factor: unless EU buying of soybeans/LNG causes an increase in US production of these commodities, which it shouldn't because this is just shifting purchases and not increasing aggregate demand, this is just window-dressing our bilateral trade balance. Meaningless.
551 2018-08-04 11:26:13 There is also a Jim Rogers reference via street name to Francis McEwen tying to a professor I had referencing a John with banking and commodities and Jim Rogers at MSU and railroads were also noted under the name Gary Wayne Kelly with an Ambassador.
552 2018-08-04 11:20:17 Is it the Indian Air Force or Indian Army who air dropped the essential commodities ?
553 2018-08-04 11:15:20 Hello! My name is Cheryl Cole. You killed my commodities sales agent. Prepare to die.
554 2018-08-04 11:02:55 Oha o gráfico de commodities vs ibov em dólar. Há algum indício de participação política? Nenhum.

Mas na educação, saúde, segurança pública, roubalheira, aparelhamento, etc, isso tem bastante influência.
555 2018-08-04 10:55:32 Yes derailed economy  put on track but 4 budgets could have been more juicy for public consumption.Industrialisation is on back foot.Agri commodities still not moving freely inside country or finding export market. Many good projects delayed. Countryside still not shining.
556 2018-08-04 10:38:32 It's scary to live in a world where humans are sold off by other humans. Where the innocent are treated like commodities. Where the powerless become slaves.
557 2018-08-04 10:31:55 “The sanctions are likely to have a profound effect on the designated companies, which would be unable to transact in U.S. dollars - the standard denomination currency in commodities trading and the main currency in counterparty transactions in international trading,” Fitch said.
558 2018-08-04 10:30:35 This is #Islam. Girls are commodities and disposed of if no longer desired.
559 2018-08-04 10:29:20 A despeito de que os países desenvolvidos quererem que os exportadores de commodities continuem exportando commodities, eles também querem que eles tenham um patamar mínimo de tecnologia para ampliar o mercado consumidor
560 2018-08-04 10:27:42 What I know and learned is. A economy don’t need Tarifs. China is here round about 4000 years and their economy need commodities and will use it. :)
561 2018-08-04 10:23:02 nah hun, you're thinking about capitalists there.  
They suck the teat of public services and exploit workers like commodities and then begrudge paying their fare share.  Human parasites if you think about it.
562 2018-08-04 10:22:37 Tangible commodities producing worthless cryptocurrencies!
563 2018-08-04 10:08:50 "Modi Govt" has been failure in all aspects be it Job creation or price rise of daily use commodities or be it women security but its biggest failure is destroying the very delicate fabric of nation , now minorities are most vulnerable than ever.
564 2018-08-04 10:05:03 3244: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
565 2018-08-04 09:44:04 and by "legitimacy" I mean - that feeling for big bank boards that their desks haven't taken leave of their senses by moving into crypto

But at one time commodities markets were the wild west. 
566 2018-08-04 09:38:23 Which commodities are these
567 2018-08-04 09:30:43 OK, so what's the plan to change the commodities into? For what it's worth I don't see the harm in keeping them in a conservative portfolio
568 2018-08-04 09:27:13 They protect the machine that could privatise them. The tories are great at selling off state owned commodities. Why have we not sold off the bbc? They need each other, there intrinsically linked to feed the people the propaganda daily. They only want you to hear their voice!
569 2018-08-04 09:23:44 I struggle to get my head around the ethics of this from a City point of view. In effect they are hoovering up young talent sending them straight out of the club with no intention that they will ever play for City? The kids are just commodities.
570 2018-08-04 09:14:16 #Leadership should be about building legends that stand for more than a quick profit. Workers should gain more than just a minimum wage, but benefit from #education, #health and security. Our #leaders are disposable like our #commodities today. #waste will become king!
571 2018-08-04 09:04:16 Sirji it is all the same, when you subsidise on LPG that is to be off set by higher taxes on other commodities. What I am saying is there should be balanced taxes on commodities.  lower LPG price will benefit the poor but the same poor has to pay higher petrol price. It is same .
572 2018-08-04 08:58:44 Today i witnesses price rise of commodities in Harare, I just ask myself is this going to be like this for 5 years?

574 2018-08-04 08:36:58 Indeed. A lot of bulk commodities buys placed by foreign governments and investors before tariffs went into effect.

578 2018-08-04 08:22:19 They always were commodities Alan, but what do we do? We can sit and watch it happen again and again, year after bloody year, or we can try to motivate & educate others to stop the sheer waste. Improvements are agonisingly slow over years & many kids are struggling in the interim
579 2018-08-04 08:16:26 It’s like trying to fill a sink with the tap on but the plug out. Not that there’s much of a financial flow, more just a trickle. I hate to say it, but uncaring political opportunists are in power, which doesn’t bode well for the care system. Children are becoming commodities...
580 2018-08-04 08:03:07 With this economy that keeps on shedding jobs and increasing commodities? Think through it...
The very same @OfficialPSL makes more income through those broadcasting rights...
581 2018-08-04 07:58:42 ‘Sexual market value’?

Dude thinks women are commodities, not people. Also thinks they have an expiration date.

Nobody who thinks like that has anything of value to say

583 2018-08-04 07:44:17 And almost everyone has a pension/bank account that you have money in. Banks use that money to invest; which may be in fossil fuels (buying commodities directly (like oil or coal) or by buying shares from petrol firm)

Would those savers be considered a hypocrite they were green?
584 2018-08-04 07:21:04 For the first time, we are able to put a price on a technological development itself and not only on imperfect proxies/second layers. This can't be compared to shares or even commodities.
585 2018-08-04 07:18:57 Well, I don't know if they make toast with it. Plus it's actually not that unusual for commodities with a price driven up by consumption in wealthy countries to become so expensive that the locals can't afford them any more. Happens with quinoa for example.
586 2018-08-04 07:06:34 Of Course—As Interest Rates Continue to Rise—Commodities & Bond Prices Continue to Fall—As Bond Yields, The Dollar & Growth Stocks—Continue to Rise.

588 2018-08-04 06:33:28 Not totally sure abt that...i wd turn d main switch off only for segments i wd never trade it like commodities etc.
589 2018-08-04 06:32:13 It's tying to commodities.

591 2018-08-04 06:29:23 It is appropriate to begin a discussion for a National Land Use policy. The US does not prosper when it is dependent on other countries for basic commodities - Food.
592 2018-08-04 06:27:06 Now you added commodities to enhance your fraud
593 2018-08-04 06:18:22 Ya sé. La culpa mediática se la cargan al consumidor que no puede pagar por un auto híbrido o popotes biodegradables, en vez de al sistema que está viciado de origen y vive literalmente de gastarse los recursos en commodities. But algo hay que hacer jaja.

595 2018-08-04 05:58:46 Because of this shit fest of an industry that treats artists like commodities to be owned by fans.... God damnit
596 2018-08-04 05:58:17 Dice "De commodities COMO el cobre", dando a entender que son otros más. Se jactan de saber de economía cuando ni siquiera saben leer.
597 2018-08-04 05:55:57 I empathise so wholeheartedly with this. The resilience required is huge as is, let alone the extra needed to managing caring responsibilities on top. Actors (w or w/out family responsibilities) are so often treated as infantilised commodities and that bs has to end #YesorNo
598 2018-08-04 05:21:58 KA @MORTHIndia are you aware of the situation in #Nagaland? Road blocked between Chakhabama - Chetheba for ~10 days & trucks carrying essential commodities (Rice, Gas etc.) are stuck. Who's going to help clear that portion of road?
599 2018-08-04 05:06:21 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
600 2018-08-04 05:05:03 3232: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
601 2018-08-04 04:49:19 Chile es un país pobre precisamente por la derecha, mamerto, no por carencia de materias primas, ¿UK y la República Alemana le deben su riqueza acaso a la explotación de sus recursos naturales y venta de commodities? Chile no es un país estable, todos sus índices son alarmantes.
602 2018-08-04 04:45:33 Como já citado, o conhecimento econômico que ele possui é também muito vago. Ele não foi capaz de fazer uma única declaração concreta sobre o assunto. O mais próximo foi onde ele comenta sobre a venda de commodities a China e a suposta aquisição de terras brasileiras pela China.
603 2018-08-04 04:42:05 Agreed. It's not about pegging the yuan to gold, as in some Nixon shock reversal

It's about setting up yuan virtuous cycles in some commodities and their financial flows

It's about the yuan gaining acceptance as a unit of account for China's imports
604 2018-08-04 04:41:35 our politician have no time to solve ppl problem like unemployment,hunger,illiteracy,garibi,tute roads,lack of school/hospital,farmer suicides,rising prices of essential commodities,deteriorating state of law and order in country,rampant corruption in system and speedy trial?
605 2018-08-04 04:40:30 How would you calculate a per person normal value for people?

Oh wait. You can’t because people aren’t commodities and dumping findings don’t “cut off” imports. 

FoM is wonderful. As a Canuck I could only wish I had similar rights in the EU.
606 2018-08-04 04:34:00 Eu nao vivi a ditatura. Nasci no governo Figueiredo.
Mas acredito que democracia, apesar de ser ruim, ainda eh melhor q qualquer outro regime. Direito de escolha.
A estatizacao, a corrupcao, o mal uso dos recursos abundantes vindos das commodities me parecem mto ruins.

611 2018-08-04 03:50:59 I feel like the only reason the Kardashian’s speak to each other in the way they do because their mother treated them all like commodities their entire lives so they know nothing about loving relationships??? They’re not siblings, they’re employees lol
612 2018-08-04 03:50:18 China is out of options and is also in the wrong corner.  This will backfire and have severe consequences in the commodities space in the years to come
613 2018-08-04 03:47:20 I meant the tit for tat on new/recent tariff impositions from both sides, specifically on selected commodities.

Was not talking about the trade deficit in real terms.
614 2018-08-04 03:41:47 Imagine exploiting commodities...ppl can terrible sub?
615 2018-08-04 03:41:17 How much are commodities?
616 2018-08-04 03:38:58 That slight increase in pay will go towards higher commodities. 1/3 of the tax cuts enjoyed by middle/low class will go towards commodities.

You tariffs on all major trading partners at once is ridiculous.

Your stupid wall will add to the deficit too & not fix a thing.
617 2018-08-04 03:09:32 Cable and internet have been out since yesterday. You have no idea how boring my life is wothout those commodities.
618 2018-08-04 03:07:27 Y’all every hear of LTD Commodities?
619 2018-08-04 03:00:05 Seguro. Solo digo que el problema es mas estructural, como alto nivel de deuda, bajas expos y dependencia de commodities.
620 2018-08-04 02:54:29 Quando caiu os preços das commodities o Brasil chegou onde estamos.
Só países comunista vive só de commodities. By Venezuela
621 2018-08-04 02:48:21 O Brasil faturou bilhões de dólares com exportação de commodities nos últimos anos e somente 55% das residências brasileiras tem esgoto mas as focas guerrilheiras insistem em focar em tentar armar armadilha para o Bolsonaro #BolsonaroNaGloboNews
622 2018-08-04 02:39:52 Dilma sabia o que era imposto?? Lula sabia o que era commodities?
623 2018-08-04 02:38:29 Prime commodities to.. Bakit ang baba sweldo ng mga workers? Ginagamit ko lahat,  paano?
624 2018-08-04 02:34:19 Agree! Commodities don't settle physically because it's too expensive to actually do the transport
625 2018-08-04 02:29:18 :::BULL::: 1: A male bovine; especially an adult [uncastrated] male domestic bovine. 2: Usually adult male animal. 3: One who buys securities or commodities in expectation of a price rise or who acts to effect such a rise. Example: This bull is going to make a great steak dinner.
626 2018-08-04 02:26:39 Minha opinião é que não votei em nenhum deles e que Lula deu sorte com o boom de commodities e com alguns bons assessores no primeiro governo, mas que depois trocou por Mantega.
627 2018-08-04 02:25:41 A única resposta que Bolsonaro concluiu com êxito foi sobre vender commodities, algo que foi tema do meu trabalho no auge do meu segundo ano do ensino médio  #BolsonaroNaGloboNews
628 2018-08-04 02:24:39 I wouldn't draw any similar conclusions about physical delivery when comparing straight up agriculture commodities and Bitcoin. This will impact price in a big, positive way.
629 2018-08-04 02:22:26 Just not good for any country to go whole hog into socialism. Just need people with integrity and honesty and things would work fine. Hard commodities to come by these days.

641 2018-08-04 02:11:22 Para o entrevistador da GloboNews tem que continuar vendendo o Brasil pra China e temos que continuar só vendendo commodities, produto manufaturado ele não sabe o que significa pelo jeito @jairbolsonaro @GloboNews
642 2018-08-04 02:11:16 O modelo liberal é, por princípio, especializar-se naquilo que você faz de melhor. Em um ambiente livre, isso acontece naturalmente. Esse lance de "agregar valor e não ser dependente de commodities" via intervenção é praticamente a visão desenvolvimentista da Dilma.
643 2018-08-04 02:11:12 Boçalnato não faz a menor ideia das previsões mundiais de que os preços das commodities irão despencar nas próximas décadas.
Ele nem sabe, sobre pressão, lembrar que é Chanceler o Min das Rel Exteriores
644 2018-08-04 02:09:49 China vai deixar de comprar commodities brasileiras o que, Conti.
645 2018-08-04 02:09:23 #GNEleicoes2018 E este cara sabe o que é commodities?

647 2018-08-04 02:04:51 o doido ele falou em investir em ciencia e tecnologia pra agregar valor nos commodities exportados e essa relaçao entre ciencia-valor agregado ja está bem a frante do entendimento de muito cientista

649 2018-08-04 02:03:16 Vamos tomar medidas para a economia rodar e não ficar apegado a commodities e eu assisti à partida de um trem de  minério!
650 2018-08-04 02:03:05 Bolsonaro falando mal das commodities. Ele sabe que agronegocio é puro commodities?
651 2018-08-04 02:00:17 What don't people understand??? When you go to the store, you're not buying information technology or services, you're buying GOODS! Think about all the physical commodities we consume DAILY!
Still need manufacturing jobs!
652 2018-08-04 01:57:58 And never on or dipped. The cinnamon roll was dessert! (Kansas)  it comes from schools getting and using commodities. In this instance, beans and flour.
653 2018-08-04 01:32:55 only one "folks" have pussy to use. 

commodities exist because of valued, perceived or otherwise. 

question for you: do you separate your penis from yourself when speaking of value?
654 2018-08-04 01:23:30 @hellogames Where's all my stuff? Ten containers on my freighter FULL of valuable commodities....GONE! My whole freighter base.... GONE! Please help!
655 2018-08-04 01:16:46 Some good questions about the (very) slow spread of Tibetan into the realm of commodities in China
656 2018-08-04 01:14:25 Não existe "influxo". Se um compra, outro vende.

Detalhe importante: cada cia tem o seu preço ligado aos seus próprios fundamentos q não necessariamente são iguais às commodities. Mas todas somadas são sim parecidas. O todo (índice, mercado) é uma entidade diferente das partes.
657 2018-08-04 01:06:21 Commodities are the opium of the people.
658 2018-08-04 01:01:14 I would argue that you are part of that group yourself. You want (a) more (b) cheaper (c) for a specific market.
But I have yet to see you advocate BETTER. Never "how" , only "who" and "how much" . i.e. Commodities.
659 2018-08-04 00:52:02 #CardinalGeorge would often quip when people spoke of their feelings rather than their thoughts: “Don’t tell me how you feel. Tell me what you think!” 

I think often: why are intellect and reason such rare commodities these days? Why is so much grounded in subjective emotions?
660 2018-08-04 00:50:52 Farmers know that once those markets are gone, they won't be coming back to the same extent. Countries like Brazil are developing more and more commodities infrastructure that will let them supply foreign markets.
661 2018-08-04 00:46:37 @hbredda e se pegar bluechips de outros setores e comparar com o índice de commodities?
Pega um Itaú, Banco do Brasil, Ultrapar ou alguma outra listada há um bom tempo...
Interessante analisar o gráfico e ver se o influxo de $ nelas tbm depende da empolgação c/ commodities ou ñ

663 2018-08-04 00:15:38 Me desculpe, mas Lula tbm não foi!
Grande parte do sucesso de seu governo foi justamente apostar na exportação de commodities.
664 2018-08-04 00:14:32 The slope of commodities versus stocks tends to decline at a rate roughly equal to productivity in the economy.  In other words, your total return in the S&P = dividends + nominal/inflation + real/productivity
665 2018-08-04 00:12:50 Everyone hates commodities (or everyone is buying the data): 

IMF/last data Jun 2017: "Publication suspended while revamping page. Unable to provide a timeline..."

World Bank/last data Jun 2018: "Not publishing while making changes to the data series. Plan to resume by Sep"
666 2018-08-04 00:06:50 Agree re commodities. Also tourism - people deciding not to travel (and one day, not be able/allowed to travel) is a factor that I fear will ultimately cripple tourism. It is not factored into long term economic projections, I have already vowed never to return to Europe
667 2018-08-04 00:00:55 Seattle was thoroughly the sanctity of these Commodities to adhere to cultivate it.
