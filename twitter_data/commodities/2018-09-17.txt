4 2018-09-17 23:23:24 China has already announced that it would retaliate by imposing duties on $60 billion of U.S. exports, including commodities such as liquefied natural gas

Beijing has responded in the past quickly and swiftly, so statement overnight is likely
5 2018-09-17 23:23:02 Hi Nick, did you watch Sunday's program? Other than @kezzatheduck commodities report and the sad outlook from the @BOM_au , which parts were "current ag issues"? They were nice stories about stuff that could be played back on the 7.30 report... that's it.

12 2018-09-17 22:51:05 I don't care about China's politics. But Right now, China is at the bottom of the "U" curve of economic value (manufacturing commodities). I do care whether we let them steal their way to the top of the U curve by ripping off intellectual property with abandon

41 2018-09-17 21:17:38 Seguro, pero el boom 2007/8 me hace pensar que hubo un efecto de la financialización de las commodities - marketinearon un nuevo asset class para generar fees, como con los hedge funds que los pusieron de moda despues del crash de las puntocom.

46 2018-09-17 20:57:34 The expectations of a certain sort of lifestyle, career opportunities, etc. It runs through society; UK unions were pretty unrealistic in their demands in the 70s for example. Those expectations were built on the huge markets and cheap commodities of Empire.

53 2018-09-17 20:20:10 Interesting how a record crop in corn and soybeans, for what would be what, the 4th year in a row now? coupled with really no new demand being created, that that has nothing to do with the current price of said commodities, because it's all Trump's fault? Idk sounds like whiners
54 2018-09-17 20:09:19 Como falei, resultado da compra de nossas commodities, a situação americana melhorou ainda mais o cenário que já era ótimo.
55 2018-09-17 20:07:18 Commodities become a fetish and distract from the real purpose. Education is no longer about educating but winning the league table battle, gaining Ofsted 'excellence', attracting more students and having a flashy website.
56 2018-09-17 20:05:22 The only victims who matter are those who can be exploited. They are just political commodities.

62 2018-09-17 19:57:13 Estava por conta de um cenário externo favorável, commodities brasileiras tiveram um aumento absurdo, fora do normal, por conta da China, Estados Unidos em crise, fizeram investidores migrarem para cá, mesmo assim no período só crescemos no nosso continente mais que o México.

64 2018-09-17 19:47:19 I use public transport most of the time and am least affected by the fuel prize raise, more over petrol and diesel prises were not at 10/5 rupees per liter during UPA. Till date no increase in prizes of other commodities
65 2018-09-17 19:45:33 Próximo presidente pode pegar mais um boom de commodities. Desta vez pelo reaquecimento da economia dos EUA. Bons ventos para @jairbolsonaro .
66 2018-09-17 19:35:06 The corporate definition of love is obsessed with commodities, property, and hoarding of things and experiences.
67 2018-09-17 19:34:27 You will save 350c than  paying for 8. You are right kumatuckshop it can be that price, very expensive yet they don't pay any tax or bring any revenue into the country apart from inflating prices of commodities. 
Thanks wangu that's all I wanted you to confirm.
68 2018-09-17 19:32:11 uma coisa que me interessa muito no plano de governo do ciro é o desafio que ele propõe de tirar o brasil da situação de exportador de commodities. é uma coisa que os economistas da cepal já discutem faz décadas. caso ele ganhe vai ser mto interessante acompanhar essa tentativa.
69 2018-09-17 19:30:30 Your energy, your time, your passion are limited and rare commodities. Treat them as such.
70 2018-09-17 19:24:33 Como resolver o retardo tecnológico, que impede a industrialização brasileira e nos faz lutar contra o dólar vendendo commodities? É investindo em universidade, velho! Ciência e tecnologia! Ciro vive dando palestra pra cientistas por quê? Porque conhece os pulos do gato! #Ciro12
71 2018-09-17 19:17:06 Do you not feel like you are doing a disservice though to women who feel like they are commodities. 

Just like women think patriarchy is is wrong, saying it's tradition is perpetuating and emboldening the male superiority complex. 

It's just not good enough imho.
72 2018-09-17 19:14:14 Just funny a day after many folk in a uproar because Vontae Davis “quit” on  his team(which I said is funny considering how teams treat players as disposable commodities) the Vikes cut bait on a rookie kicker!he admitted he was scared-got to go!!#fairisfair#shockspeaks
73 2018-09-17 19:12:56 The 2.4million are overtaxed  already. Not unless there are cards that will exempt those who are being taxed from buying commodities imposed with taxes.
74 2018-09-17 19:09:42 Yeah overall continuous improvement in Logistics efficiencies have helped in prevention of cascading  
effect on price of commodities .
Surely GST has been a boon to this.
75 2018-09-17 19:09:41 I'm under 35. I see you. I also dispute his assumption that people should concern themselves with something like "sexual market value". Kind of sounds like something said in sex trafficking rings, doesn't it? *Shivers*
People aren't commodities & age doesn't mean jack.

77 2018-09-17 19:03:58 No exterior, o clima segue de cautela entre as principais bolsas, após o presidente Donald Trump voltar a defender sua estratégia de importar novas tarifas sobre produtos chineses. Entre as commodities, o petróleo opera em alta.

84 2018-09-17 18:49:39 After arresting chorela we need to arrest corrupt people and deal with escalating prices of basic commodities and  inflation. Moving foward we also need to fast track solution for cash crises , unemployment and revive our industry.
85 2018-09-17 18:41:46 1. Offsets are an exchange of money for certified absence of emissions. $105b is many times the size of the current foreign aid budget, much of which is used to buy US ag commodities or weapons (ie not really a transfer);
86 2018-09-17 18:35:23 Friends that call you just to tell you a story or talk about random stuff are precious commodities and need to be protected at all costs

90 2018-09-17 18:25:46 All the rage I felt during Anita Hill hearings has resurfaced — AGAIN

Kavanaugh CANNOT be confirmed
91 2018-09-17 18:16:57 hmmmmmmm..take this with a grain of salt...it's the admin saying this not the entire picture...wages stagnate and declining in real dollars..increases in fuel, food prices, and other commodities increasing due to tariffs (which are equiv of taxes on consumers
92 2018-09-17 18:16:40 This discussion is going on a tangent ! What is highlighted here is that despite fuel prices having gone up - efficiencies in supply chain & commerce have managed to prevent the cost of commodities & other essential items from going up proportionately as we saw during UPA era
93 2018-09-17 18:13:39 state leaders all need marketable commodities in the current system.
94 2018-09-17 18:07:09 Well, he can buy and sell a lot of commodities with all that!!!

99 2018-09-17 17:46:58 agreed -the market is sick- but I am defensively positioned- mostly precious(GDX/NUGT/SLV/PAAS) metals, commodities--junk food (PPC,) pot (ACBFF), smokes (MO) ..I buy the stuff no one wants, and wait. even long SDS ...
it's ticking, but nice to be green on red days!
100 2018-09-17 17:46:24 adding bacon to Mac and cheese is objectively a waste of bacon as the value of saltiness and savoriness is already present in the dish, and texture can be replaced by less precious commodities. In this essay I will argue (1/10)
101 2018-09-17 17:42:32 Do you realize you are comparing services to commodities(things)? Do you understand that automation & technological advances usually will lead to the lowering of cost. Look at the oil industry. What did you learn in college?
102 2018-09-17 17:41:35 Trump is a distraction. The surplus of Ag commodities is why farm income is down
103 2018-09-17 17:35:38 It is a very sorry state of affairs at "Pumwani Hospital". Capitalism is turning everything to commodities.

107 2018-09-17 17:23:37 Really stupid move. Will only result in higher priced commodities. All American consumers will pay for your ignorant decision.
108 2018-09-17 17:23:11 We Womenfolk are commodities and conquests to men like this; thus, our stories of assault are themselves commodities for men as they chalk things up to "youth" and "drunkenness" and "experience" and  "growing up."

Them: oh every guy has groped a woman. We live and learn. 

109 2018-09-17 17:22:30 “Big yuuuge profits” were NEVER BIG (except for the top 1%)and are now being offset by commodities increases. Only a mendacious inept would put out this bull pucky and expect people to applaud.
110 2018-09-17 17:22:22 This is interesting. i've seen a similar theory, though not called Black Swan, in commodities for many years. An example, using seasonal or price distribution studies, buy a far OTM call (or put, depending on when and where) for fractions of a cent & wait for possible pay off.
111 2018-09-17 17:19:50 We are running short of  basic commodities like tablets at various pharmacies in the country
112 2018-09-17 17:10:34 Sometimes stupidity is beyond measure, why would someone think that Econet is so dumb as not to know the prices of these commodities.
113 2018-09-17 17:10:21 And what will you sale tomorrow if the hunger persists,you forget most kenyans depend on farming not tin foods 
You will end up turning kenyans to commodities for bilateral trade hunger is not for one day,ask God 
Find away to solve your problems,not this
114 2018-09-17 17:05:49 When There are Humans who believe that Mother Earth is only for them.... They take all other creatures and resources as just commodities for extraction of every possible benefits.... Seeing an Industrialist like you with Humanity for all living being gives me to feel proud.
115 2018-09-17 17:05:18 Give your citizens affordable basic commodities like food etc, good and affordable health care and quality education the rest most can manage. Whoever came with the idea of housing and it's not for free was under influence of something. He was high.

118 2018-09-17 16:54:04 This. Gold would be worthless, too. Food/warmth will be the valuable commodities.
119 2018-09-17 16:50:57 I could tell stories of whole boxes of Sharpies going missing :/

Oh, archaeological adventures. In that case, it was probably swiped by colleagues. Sharpies are precious commodities on excavations.
120 2018-09-17 16:49:14 Public goods are not the same as commodities.

A Public Good is a service or system that can be used by everyone equally. e.g. roads and police.

Healthcare is a commodity not a public good usable and equal for all. Just look at how well it has worked out in Canada.

122 2018-09-17 16:39:50 Animals are not commodities, they are sentient living beings as we are and should be protected as such. No one can righteously sustain that they are not and that treating them as objects is just.

126 2018-09-17 16:30:05 #L525 The repetition of the phrase “This is the point of (person)” really weirded me out. It relegates characters to the role of concepts instead of people. I guess that plays in to the concept of people becoming commodities with each person being made to have a role.

131 2018-09-17 16:00:42 A few months or years from now, we will see Aya's face in some of the commodities that we consume, and I think that's beautiful.
132 2018-09-17 15:59:52 Agreed. Even normies are waking up to this. Mostly conservative normies. The progressives think they are "resisting," but they will learn soon enough that we are all the same in the eyes of the elite: commodities to be bought, sold and traded like livestock.

151 2018-09-17 14:26:45 "Cost increases are almost unnoticeable" 

Um. No. And they're borne by everyone, while the benefits flow only to producers in the protected industry & are smaller than the total cost. 

Tariffs on intermediate goods & commodities, like steel, are especially ill-conceived.

160 2018-09-17 13:58:24 While I won't argue the broader point that US agriculture is subsidized, 1) it takes a broad definition of 'subsidy', and 2) US farmers in aggregate are incredibly efficient. If every country took every type of subsidy away, very few US commodities would fall out of production.

164 2018-09-17 13:43:03 (Sentiment definitely fell on November 8, 2016). Consumer sentiment, however, has remained about the same since your election. BUT, may decrease. Any gains we may made are subsumed in increased costs for commodities. Obama saved us from this Rep pattern of inflating the deficit.
165 2018-09-17 13:42:45 The league will languish if the "stars" of the league are unknown commodities to the public at large. Great play, good characters and rivalries are why we love the NBA (my generation). The same will probably hold true for the League. In other words stream baby!!!

169 2018-09-17 13:21:20 190 rtgs because it buys basic Commodities. Prices aren't that bad yet.
170 2018-09-17 13:18:02 Draghi has said that short-term 2% inflation won’t be exceeded. Juncker has said europe must use euros instead of USD to purchase commodities. The US has a huge fiscal and trafe deficit. So barring a liquidity crisis the USD should be heading lower relative to EUR at some point.

176 2018-09-17 13:03:28 The government has to do something pple are hoarding basic commodities in supermarkets. Pple are panicking, they're thinking of the 2008 era whereby the BLACK MARKET was a cash cow.
177 2018-09-17 12:54:02 China has the enviable position of being the world's largest exporter of MANUFACTURED goods... while others export commodities and import manufactured goods.
178 2018-09-17 12:53:17 The retaliatory tarriffs placed on ag commodities by our foreign customers are causing us to bleed red ink.  Subsidy payments do little or nothing to close the gap.  We need our markets now!

190 2018-09-17 11:33:13 We're expecting answers from a lot that doesn't care. We're taxed on every single thing we buy. Everything, even essential commodities have almost doubled in price. But our incomes remain the same. It won't get better because they can't even accept that there is a problem.

208 2018-09-17 10:27:18 I saw a tweet yesterday talking about how this type of self care is reflective of the current stage of capitalism ie be entirely self centered, everything is disposable, dispose of commodities (friends) if they aren’t as useful to furthering you in life. V gross

232 2018-09-17 08:18:53 Isn't it strange? When prices of farm commodities like potato, onion etc increase in the domestic market, government bans or restricts its exports. But when prices of petrol/diesel go through the roof, why there is no talk of stopping exports?
233 2018-09-17 08:14:42 That 10c inflation on basic commodities is what we dont want. The Zimbabwe government has failed. You cant rig the economy
234 2018-09-17 08:13:43 Fears about securely buying domains with Bitcoins are a red herring. It’s easy to trade Bitcoins for other non-reputable commodities.
235 2018-09-17 08:13:37 If you are already trading in commodities and crypto separately, you will find it much easier to combine your crypto trading with commodity trading using this option.

236 2018-09-17 08:13:00 Tethered assets are coming to $BURST whose value will be linked to real-world currencies and commodities regardless of the $BURST price (like a decentralised and auditable $USDT)

This could be huge for $BURST given issues with $USDT and could be applied to any commodity
237 2018-09-17 08:11:13 I’m seeing this picture a few times now and while it’s infuriating that they are treated like commodities and not living beings a link to an article or something would be good. I can’t find any recent event and want to write to Senators about it. Laws need to change.
238 2018-09-17 08:11:13 Pandeyji what a misunderstanding is it! Under MGNREGA 1.2 crores family was put above poverty by UPA. But due to misrule of bjp crores of people are being pushed again to poverty as prices of all commodities are abnormally high.

241 2018-09-17 08:08:41 The problem with #AgedCare is that it functions just like a restaurant - fast turnover is its business model and patients are not seen as people but commodities.

242 2018-09-17 08:01:09 "Emerging markets will continue to feel pressure as it becomes more expensive in a local currency to purchase dollar-based commodities and debt."
243 2018-09-17 08:00:26 Those who see Bitcoin as digital gold make this fundamental mistake that gold, just like crude and other traded commodities, HAS that connection (jewels, technics) what Bitcoin never will have, even not as “criminals currency” as it IS traceable

245 2018-09-17 07:54:59 Yeah. We prefer urad dal to fuel our vehicles and go to work and earn money to buy those commodities. Petrol/Diesel not required to buy those commodities.
246 2018-09-17 07:53:07 But prices of petrol, diesel and rupee are on rise, rest commodities have seen deflation specially food items.
247 2018-09-17 07:49:32 Prices are commodities are down but some people prefer to drink petrol these days.

262 2018-09-17 06:47:06 not just up to the Tories - councils and local communities (including business) need to get their act together - more residential accommodation above shops, free parking, lower business rates, more experience/services and less selling of commodities, imagination and innovation
263 2018-09-17 06:43:46 In fact, personal style, defined by the commodities we buy or consume, has become a compensation for our loss of democratic equality. We have a right, in the cult of the self, to get whatever we desire. We can do anything, even belittle and destroy those around us,

276 2018-09-17 05:40:22 IMO currency trading is a different ball game compared to equities & commodities.
People trade big vols for small moves.

So govt intervention always scares traders..
277 2018-09-17 05:38:16 Gutu wabantu, the rising prices of basic commodities mean that the current government is incapable of reviving this economy, our experience for the past 38yrs also proves that.

281 2018-09-17 05:19:19 BUSINESSMEN HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF VAT ON FUEL PRICES TO EXPLOIT THE POOR KENYANS. To disarm such unscrupulous traders who have already increased prices of commodities (including,l meat prices, house rents, etc) the govt & Parliament should scrap VAT on fuels.
282 2018-09-17 05:13:04 Good news: USD and Gold are expected to decorrelate over the next 90+ days. Bad news: USD gonna hit 100 by early 2019. EM pain not over. Not great for commodities overall (crude is now in range-about market). Shortly I will publish some stuff..
283 2018-09-17 05:00:24 I hear ya! We shouldn't have to pay taxes, there's $30 trillion worth of commodities in our Land, we should be getting dividends not tax bills.

286 2018-09-17 04:57:35 Even if they approve,the damage is already done.the prices of commodities will remain the same

291 2018-09-17 04:19:17 Everything is a fiat currency, commodities hard assets all based on perceived value. Running high debt in high inflation &growth periods is most inefficient stimulus that threats higher inflation and credit downgrades...
292 2018-09-17 04:05:05 #APCProject SCPZ: This idea focuses on attracting private sector agribusinesses to set up processing plants in zones of high food production, to process commodities into food products. Nigeria under @APCNigeria @MBuhari is agribusiness environment.
293 2018-09-17 04:01:14 Hope the petrol price reaches to Rs 200 and above then with the same logic we will get all the necessary  commodities at almost throw away price, were you in the same school as Modi, Ooohhhh we still dont know even if he did go to school.
294 2018-09-17 03:56:23 If only they reduced their salaries and extravagant expenditures within govt then there would be no need to tax basic commodities that cause the cost of living to balloon. We need austerity measures but the leaders have to be humble to accept reduced pay packs.

300 2018-09-17 03:32:25 Mr Asad Umar, I would like to get one thing in your notes. ”N league propaganda” prices of all the commodities, i.e clothes, shows, even all house hold things have been increased forcefully by the suppliers just to ditch the PTI GOV before the bye election.
