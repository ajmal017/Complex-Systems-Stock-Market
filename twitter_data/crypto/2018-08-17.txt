19 2018-08-19 23:59:47 “Mainstream press outlets covering battered crypto markets have frequently invoked that phrase in recent weeks. For those of us who've followed the cryptocurrency scene for five years or more, the natural retort is: "When hasn't it been in crisis?"

22 2018-08-19 23:58:43 Credit cards wont be under attack by the Sovereigns since they don't pose  threat to their IRON RULE the way Bitcoin or other crypto's will.  I still believe by rook or by crook, they will crush Bitcoin.

26 2018-08-19 23:57:26 Unfortunately "allegedly" is the word. Hardware and software development are different beasts, and IOTA devs have no track record of any hardware development.

33 2018-08-19 23:56:04 No one wants to answer the throne cult question. It’s hard to quantify. But if you want reach crypto enthusiasts, spend your quantifying the cost of the bullshit money you currently use. I bet those bomb backed currencies have a larger cost. Maybe I’m wrong but..not my burden
34 2018-08-19 23:55:30 おそらくはアウトかと…。今のところブロックチェーン、エクスプローラー等は動いますので、削除はないとは思いますが、故障したらCEからは削除もありますね。公式テレグラムも、600名ほどユーザーが集まりました。続々と増えてます。ほぼ韓国の方ですけど…。

41 2018-08-17 23:59:46 Inb4 "hopium this" "hopium that".

That is very correct, one thing that surprises me with crypto is that this market can go much lower and higher than you expect or imagine it could.

48 2018-08-17 23:58:50 I once was in the former Yugoslavia with 10% inflation / week. It needs to be seen to be believed. Then you understand, crypto is not just a poor man's choice, it's a real choice. Even when it's in full bear mode, crypto could be a way out of that mess.
