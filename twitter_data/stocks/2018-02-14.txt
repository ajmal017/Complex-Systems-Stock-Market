0 2018-02-14 23:59:40 No one is trying to get YOUR guns numskull. Progressive politicians are pushing for laws that ban bump stocks, and regulations that keep guns away from people with history of domestic violence or mental illness.
Does that sound SOOOOO bad?
1 2018-02-14 23:58:46 What to do? total background checks, 3-day waiting, safety courses, No Military guns, Limit bullets in clips, No Bump-stocks, No hollow-point bullets, NO FLY/NO BUY, CDC gun research, True mental health parity, Smart guns. Inconvenient yes but will not stop lawful gun ownership!
2 2018-02-14 23:58:42 Baffled by John Q. Public’s need for AR-15 style weapons, bump stocks, extended mags, silencers. I am yet to hear a cogent reason why those are not military grade only. #stonemanshooting
3 2018-02-14 23:57:57 I have to disagree with you on this. Fully support banning  bump stocks but people bear a responsibility to keep their firearms out of reach of children. A manual safety (like the 1911's have) is great but not effective in stopping a child from shooting someone by accident
4 2018-02-14 23:57:43 Let's see if you can propose legislation that would have prevented this specific event. The leftist won't allow legislation that would have outlawed bump stocks, they would rather # their chests. #Shame.
5 2018-02-14 23:57:24 The Vegas shooter was a rarity as far mass shootings go. For his plan he needed a rifle for range. Shotgun or pistol wouldn't be effective from his nest. Also I think bump stocks like he use should be banned
6 2018-02-14 23:56:54 Like I keep saying, we need to track & insure guns just like cars. A national database that all can check. Oh & track ammunition & bump stocks & all accessories for guns. That in addition to what’s above is a good start.
7 2018-02-14 23:56:42 Mr President please call special meeting this week with Republicans and take action immediately on the bump stocks and type of rifle used today. Please take lead and have American families see real action is taking place!
8 2018-02-14 23:56:29 Prayers make you feel something?
That's right you voted for state reciprocity in concealed weapons permits
You have prayed to the other 17 school shootings it is not working
Limit 10 shot magazines
Require background checks
Eliminate bump stocks
Return NRA campaign contributions
9 2018-02-14 23:56:00 Nothing will happen because of this. They didn't even ban bump stocks after Vegas. There is one day when we can begin to stop the scourge of gun violence in America, and it's Tuesday, November 6. #VoteOutGOP
10 2018-02-14 23:54:38 Are we entering another cycle of bad news is good news for stocks?
11 2018-02-14 23:54:26 Bump stocks are still legal, months after the Las Vegas massacre. You, your buddies at the terrorist organization known as the NRA & the GOP are doing everthing you can to get more assault weapons on our streets. There's a special place in hell for you folks.
12 2018-02-14 23:54:03 Mandatory background checks on any gun purchase. Removal of automatic weapons from civilians. No more selling bump stocks. As a start. Perhaps investigate ways to hold gun owners accountable if their weapons are used by another person to commit a crime.
13 2018-02-14 23:53:43 Not at this rate, this is the 18th school shooting this year alone FOCUS ON REALITY. Banning assault guns that no one but soldiers should possess, bump stocks, and addressing mental health by making health care accessible 2 all would drastically cut down on mass shootings.
14 2018-02-14 23:53:40 You're prayers don't change anything, except make you feel a tiny bit better yourselves!

Where are you with concrete changes that will make a difference? Outlaw assault rifles! Outlaw bump stocks! Insist on reasonable checks for gun purchases! C'mon, do something!

16 2018-02-14 23:53:30 These aren’t rants about gun control. They are the thoughts of most concerned Americans the we need reasonable gun legislation. Before you criticize , I am a gun owner. There is no way that assult rifles or bump stocks should be legal. Schools should be safe places.

34 2018-02-14 23:53:12 Still not convinced financial markets have fully priced in higher interest rates or the prospect of a more aggressive Fed. 10-yr T-note breached 2.91% today but stocks still jumped after initial jitters.
35 2018-02-14 23:53:07 Thoughts and prayers are sponsored by the @NRA again today.  Too much money in too many pockets to do anything. They have the plebes thinking the world will end if you can’t fill your home with AR-15’s and bump stocks.
36 2018-02-14 23:53:01 I agree, but a real president could get a reasonable approach to gun control started and press congress to work on a solution. It isn’t going to happen with this guy. Won’t even say anything regarding the NRA. We haven’t done anything on bump stocks in LV. Nothing will be done
37 2018-02-14 23:52:57 I see a perfect storm brewing for #zinc. Stockpiles have fallen off a cliff over the last month and continue to fall each night. #zinc price keeps pushing up against the resistance zone and sooner or later will have to push through to blue skies imo. #zinc stocks will follow.
38 2018-02-14 23:52:50 Money. Plain and simple. America has been the world’s number one arms dealer since the civil war.

If we stop killing each other, stocks will take a dive.

It’s almost like capitalism is fundamentally broken, and only gaining steam as it hurtles towards oblivion...
39 2018-02-14 23:52:34 If anyone in that administration says this is not the time to talk about guns,  swear my freaking head will explode.
It is far past the time for us to talk about it.
The AR15 is a weapon of war. It is not part of the 2nd ammendment nor are bump stocks
40 2018-02-14 23:52:25 Bump stocks have allegedly been used in exactly 1 crime, ever. And the legislature took that action - with sloppily written legislation, not Healey.
41 2018-02-14 23:52:25 All hands on deck for gun control now!  The House Investigation is critically important but we need elected reps. to take action now to ban semi-automatic weapons, bump stocks, etc.  DO SOMETHING!!
42 2018-02-14 23:52:13 Restrictions on assault rifles. Bans on high capacity magazines and bump stocks. Universal background checks. There are plenty of ways of limiting access to what is essentially military weaponry without an outright ban on all firearms.
43 2018-02-14 23:52:01 BBG:

There's a saying that markets will do whatever causes the greatest pain. So, if you like most everyone else bought into the popular theory that faster inflation and higher interest rates would kill the bull market in stocks, then you're feeling a lot of pain.
44 2018-02-14 23:52:00 Gun manufacturers will be happy as stocks will rise . Absolutely nothing will happen after this just like Vegas. Insane!
45 2018-02-14 23:51:45 Spare us your #FakeOutrage.

What did you do about bump stocks? NOTHING

What did you do after LV shooting? NOTHING

Texas church

NOTHING NOTHING NOTHING NOTHING NOTHING NOTHING

265 days till midterms...
46 2018-02-14 23:51:40 Anyone in Congress should be forced to sell off their stocks when they file paperwork to run for office and should be banned on owning any until the end of their term.
47 2018-02-14 23:51:37 Bump stocks! Those are still legal, too.
48 2018-02-14 23:51:02 They couldn't even ban bump stocks after the Vegas massacre.

The only way out of this nightmare is elections.
49 2018-02-14 23:51:02 There is a very very easy legislation, Im sorry but, no detachable stocks, and a 26” minimum. I believe in a 30+1 rd maximum and 7 magazines per caliber. Background check, 21+, and 3 day wait. THAT is ALOT and if extended nationwide (all states accept),  a 2 Tactical defense rif
50 2018-02-14 23:50:31 Lols @ChristoThurston your people been chilling @muggandbean_kw with laptop trading forex and stocks for the past 15yrs,Now that the secret is out to all its regarded as a scam, Nah Broeh come on
51 2018-02-14 23:50:27 The National Russian Association has blocked every attempt at meaningful hun regulation. They defended bump stocks for God’s sake. You’re just a tool of gun fetishists.
52 2018-02-14 23:49:49 Weren’t the Republicans going to elimate bump stocks after Vegas?  Yeah, right. These people have no respect for life unless it’s profitable
53 2018-02-14 23:49:38 Number one people cannot legally buy a military style weapon. They are semi automatic rifles. The same thing as a Browning 22 that you would buy your child as a first weapon. Bump stocks, hell I have one on a rifle, not a problem of people have them.
54 2018-02-14 23:49:28 Sorry- I practice what I preach. I vote for Democrats, the party of common sense gun laws, not for Republicans, the party of “let crazy people get guns and bump stocks are cool.”

Are you ok with the daily shootings while the GOP- the “law & order” party- bears responsibility?
55 2018-02-14 23:49:16 Name more than 2 stocks I have been in. Thanks. As for the rest, you are welcome to sit next to me any day. I will show you what I do, then you can run to twitter and tell everyone what you learned. I will even buy you a chair like mine to sit in. You can be someone for a day!
56 2018-02-14 23:48:57 I guess that means stocks r rising; time to sell when he says to buy lol
57 2018-02-14 23:48:44 The dems had senate and house majority when bump stocks were made legal.
58 2018-02-14 23:48:39 Wala na raw tikoy for you. HAHAHAHA jk basta mag red ka at abutan mo yung stocks G lang hahaha
59 2018-02-14 23:48:28 Bump stocks ban, and make mandatory weapons safety training and licensing for people who like to pretend they are the Great White Hunter by climbing a deer standing after baiting deer with corn at baiting stations throughout property, maybe require gun manufacture execs (1/2)
60 2018-02-14 23:48:20 No there weren't but there also wasn't the gun culture or stock piles of easy access guns we have today.  There were hunting rifles and Pistols, not AR's with bump stocks and extended mags.  Even gangs in the 70's and 80's tended to use knifes instead of guns due to cost, access.
61 2018-02-14 23:47:59 I think we are on the same page with a few stocks
62 2018-02-14 23:47:58 So something please.  Stop talking and take action.  Introduce a bill banning bump stocks, silencers and semi-automatic weapons.  It is not enough anymore to talk.  Action must be taken.  We need leadership on this issue.  Please step up and DO SOMETHING!!
63 2018-02-14 23:47:57 I think some common sense gun control measures would be some regulations on bump stocks and the sale of automatic weapons, at least for starters.
64 2018-02-14 23:47:48 How about you offer something more meaningful that prayers and condolences? Think it might be time to look at what these shootings have in common? Hint: it's guns. Why don't you ask for universal background checks, close the gun show loophole, or ban bump/slide stocks?
65 2018-02-14 23:47:41 Heard so much BS in the last days... Ohhhh man!! 
#trading #bearmarketNOT #stocks
66 2018-02-14 23:47:28 Yes, there’s nothing wrong with thinking the American thing to do is #GunControlNow We can still honor the 2nd without assault rifles, bump stocks, etc  @NRA
67 2018-02-14 23:47:10 Remember $GRDO is a Bill Schaefer Stock none of his stocks ever sustain any runs. $MINE made millionaires a few years ago out of young college kids lol. All I’m saying is the risk/reward is on our side here. I’ll bet 65+ Million shares I’m right (-;
Penny stocks r cyclical imho
68 2018-02-14 23:47:03 Bump stocks...and handguns and rifles, even...will be able to be printed at home soon. They already can be, with a little bit of work.
69 2018-02-14 23:46:40 NRA opposed to anything approaching reform, even for bump stocks which should be a total no-brainer.
70 2018-02-14 23:46:38 WTF have you done to make it harder for kids to bring AR15s to school w/tons of magazines/ammo to shoot our kids??? Take your prayers & shove them where the sun doesn't shine! Do something for a change! Est background checks or ban Assault weapons & bump stocks! #FloridaShooting
71 2018-02-14 23:45:58 Well also a lot of people responsibly use bump stocks, and if you represent a population that uses bump stocks then you should not vote to ban them. You should vote how your district feels.
72 2018-02-14 23:45:20 Oh boy! Stocks will surely rise for gun manufacturers today. Yippee. Another horror story just like Vegas. But as usual NOTHING will be done. NRA and republicans have kids blood on their hands tonight
73 2018-02-14 23:44:58 Banning AR 15's & bump stocks = a great place to start.

75 2018-02-14 23:44:40 OUTLAW bump stocks and any other thing that increases firing speed. 6/
76 2018-02-14 23:44:20 one of the sad things about this shooting is realizing I don't even need to assign lots of stories - we already have stories on why guns aren't a 'mental health' issue, the AR-15 used, arming teachers, gun stocks going up, etc etc #FloridaSchoolShooting
77 2018-02-14 23:44:06 Here’s a few ideas... ban magazines that can hold x amount of bullets. Do something to regulate ammunition. Ban bump stocks and devices tha makes it easier to fire alot and quickly. Do gun buy backs. Just a few off the top of my head
78 2018-02-14 23:43:51 Bump stocks-‘good’ need those too according to @GOP.  Amiright? Your terrible day arrived and your party is to blame for doing more to support the NRA
79 2018-02-14 23:43:35 Hope Chelsea won't make us laughing stocks too the way Real Madrid did PSG!
80 2018-02-14 23:43:33 Nahh son save your money and invest in stocks instead
81 2018-02-14 23:43:24 Cheer up Preet - 'cause the economy you know. You can gorge on more chocolate. Trump is putting woman like Stormy back to work.  Or like penny stocks trading on our major exchanges, FCC & net neutrality, buy back debt financing making everything purdy b4 the Great Crash of 2018.
82 2018-02-14 23:43:24 Brother .01 is not hard for any penny Stock, $ERBB $DEWM hit .155 & .035 before on nothing but rumors. We all know penny stocks run on MOMO & $MINE is in the Hall of Fame of Cult Stocks & once they announce their #ICO or #BlockChain news .01 will come quick
83 2018-02-14 23:43:01 #NRA & #GOP congressmen responsible for deaths of hundreds of innocent people every year. Major ongoing problem with guns & mental illness & they refuse to act. Wouldn't even ban bump stocks after Las Vegas massacre. Value their jobs more than protecting people. #florida
84 2018-02-14 23:43:01 Did president phuckface just buy a bunch of stocks in oil?  #FuckTrump
85 2018-02-14 23:43:00 GOP wouldn't even vote to ban bump stocks. They block every vote because they're paid by the NRA.
86 2018-02-14 23:42:43 Just wondering why an ASSAULT rifle is acceptable or necessary in any society that is not at war. 
And lets not forget those "bump" stocks.
87 2018-02-14 23:42:29 8 in ten Americans support banning high capacity magazines.
8 in ten Americans support a federal gun registry.
8 in ten Americans support expanded background checks.
8 in ten Americans support banning bump stocks.

Why can't we even have a VOTE, @SpeakerRyan & @SenateMajLdr?

89 2018-02-14 23:42:06 I'm talking whatever. I want a genuine answer. I'm not an expert but you seem to be. I'm talking stocks, grips, magazines, scopes, bump stocks, etc. Is the second as modular and upgradable as the first
90 2018-02-14 23:41:58 You might be right on baskets, fake titties, fake coin and stocks but you are so out of your league on this stuff.  The conspiracy web sites have warped your brain and by tomorrow they will be touting this one as fake also.
91 2018-02-14 23:41:20 Bump stocks.
92 2018-02-14 23:41:12 Why is it so surprising? Did you already forget Las Vegas? AR-15’s and bump stocks are legal in the U.S. you can also purchase as much ammunition as you want. To think this won’t happen at least every six months is ludicrous. WAKE UP PEOPLE!
93 2018-02-14 23:40:57 The difference between a M4, M16, and AR-15 is negligible. Especially with bump stocks on the market. Same thing with suppressors; no justifiable reasoning.
The point is, people can still have their guns. Handguns, shotguns, rifles a plenty, but not on an escalating scale.
94 2018-02-14 23:40:30 Do what, think of a law that would have prevented this specific event. The Democrats are preventing outlawing of bump stocks. They threaten to load up any clean legislation. #Shame
95 2018-02-14 23:40:03 Spoken as someone who lined his pockets with NRA blood money. The blood is on you bands Senator, you have the ability to put sensible gun laws in place, do we really need assault weapons on the street? Bump stocks?  Wake the hell up.  You MUST ACT NOW.
96 2018-02-14 23:40:02 Push for magazine limits. Getting rid of bump stocks. Advanced tech on trigger locks. Gun registration. Ammo purchasing limits. Complete background checks. Longer waiting periods. Gun safety courses. Licensing. Limits on firing rates. Want me to go on?
97 2018-02-14 23:39:49 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
98 2018-02-14 23:38:31 Stop allowing our children to be murdered at school. Ban assault weapons..ban bump stocks...start there  @SenatorBurr @SenThomTillis #GunControlNow
99 2018-02-14 23:38:13 Would you seriously fund the Democrats if you were George Soros and he just got burnt so badly and him laying his wallet on the line again?  He may as well dump into high risk stocks and probably have better luck with Wall Street than the Democrats.
100 2018-02-14 23:37:35 It's weird that yields rose but stocks were unaffected. Makes me think initial sell off had a different catalyst than concerns over rising rates.
101 2018-02-14 23:37:34 new stocks nanaman yung online shop na binibilhan ko!!! tigilan nyoko please, galit na tatay ko!!  papaputol na daw nya internet namin para matigil ang kakaorder ko 
102 2018-02-14 23:37:29 We still talking about banning bump stocks or has that token gesture already been dismissed?
103 2018-02-14 23:37:23 You forgot about how Jefferson wanted us to have bump stocks, infrared sights and grenade launcher attachments.
104 2018-02-14 23:37:16 Have bump stocks even gotten a vote in committee yet?

106 2018-02-14 23:36:38 hey, uhh, we couldn't outlaw bump stocks, which make semi-autos into automatic weapons. Fully automatic weapons are illegal.
107 2018-02-14 23:36:18 "Nomura Instinet analyst points to Michael Kors and Tiffany & Co. as bargain retail stocks."
108 2018-02-14 23:36:14 If you’re trying to refer to the Vegas shooting, majority of people don’t even believe in Bump stocks and they shouldn’t be legal. Even most GOP congressmen agree with that
109 2018-02-14 23:35:48 Unless you are military or law enforcement, no one needs an assault weapon.  They are used for hunting one thing only.....people. 

They should be banned, as should armor piercing bullets and bump stocks.  The @gop and NRA have the blood of these children on their hands.
110 2018-02-14 23:35:41 It never ends. Nothing on bump stocks since Vegas and now another senseless act of gun violence.
111 2018-02-14 23:35:30 Another fucking senseless school shooting with an assault rifle. Expect the usual pointless platitudes from our spineless politicians, and if your’e morally bankrupt, make sure to buy gun stocks tomorrow. They always spike the next day.
112 2018-02-14 23:35:25 I agree with @JoeSquawk why would you want to get into bonds at 3% instead of stocks? The US economy is roaring! Time to own those companies.
113 2018-02-14 23:34:50 17 dead in FL and he does nothing. He was saved by grace yet does NOTHING to save our children. No hearings. No vote on background checks, large magazines, bump stocks. Nothing.
114 2018-02-14 23:34:37 Bump stocks had literally nothing to do with this
115 2018-02-14 23:34:30 Don't forget:
4) Stocks in gun manufacturers will rise
5) Regulations will loosen further
116 2018-02-14 23:34:11 i just been teaching myself how to buy sell and trade stocks lately, that why i can become wealthy.
117 2018-02-14 23:33:59 The safety net for Walmart, HEB,  Krogers and others.  Will be gone and will have immediate effects on stocks.

119 2018-02-14 23:33:31 Yet #investors and #analysts are curios to why #market corrections are occurring. We may slowly be transitioning into a much needed bear market. #Stocks are generally overpriced and we've been in a very long bull run. What comes up, must come down, & you can only delay the bear.
120 2018-02-14 23:33:23 After Las Vegas we couldn’t even control bump stocks, how sad is that? We are a global example of what not to do to protect innocent victims. We know the NRA owns the GOP so nothing will be done but thoughts and prayers.
121 2018-02-14 23:32:29 $RGR $AOBC $RGR gun stocks higher in AH
122 2018-02-14 23:32:26 lol i was just making a joke because you said "Friends in Whittier". But I would recommend looking at you plan and finding "Retirement 20xx" Fund. These Funds are aggressive in growth while you are young (7-10% ROI) As you age they move the money to safer stocks
123 2018-02-14 23:32:01 if you want to reduce the risk of all forms of gun deaths, limit gun access, restrict the number of guns and ammunitions purchases per person, improve mental health services and get rid of bump-stocks and high capacity magazines and enforce current laws.
124 2018-02-14 23:31:24 This must be what @realDonaldTrump meant when he said #MAGA. So many school shootings already in his Presidency. It's better marketing for the @NRA. So many #2A idiots will buy guns/ammo causing gun stocks to skyrocket. #AllAboutTheMoney
125 2018-02-14 23:31:07 Stocks will rise for gun manufacturers. Fox and the right are masters at using mass shootings to stoke fears about gun bans, sending thousands to their local gun shops.  Happens every time.
126 2018-02-14 23:31:06 Banning this sort of weapon alon would save countless lives. If you're a bad enough shot to need an AR-15 for hunting, you need to find a new pass-time. It is also time for bump stocks to be ban.
127 2018-02-14 23:30:48 Let’s talk about this: In October, Las Vegas shooter killed 59 with weapons fitted with bump stocks, converting semi-auto into auto weapons. Why have you and GOP-led Congress done nothing to outlaw these deadly devices?
128 2018-02-14 23:30:31 The president was probly too busy buying gun  Company stocks. Gun sales always go up after a shooting.
129 2018-02-14 23:30:20 Everyone needs to get over oppression, stop whining, and get with the times (black people, Native Americans, women, etc...). But because of the Revolutionary War, we need bump stocks. #TYTLive #GOPLogic
130 2018-02-14 23:30:18 There were +500 casualties in Vegas with semi automatics and bump stocks! What else is to be expected! The 2nd amendment is madness
131 2018-02-14 23:30:14 @jeffsessions the fact that AR-15s and bump stocks are legal is the real problem.. Not legal cannabis. . fuck you @realDonaldTrump feel terrible for the victims and everyone involved at the school.
132 2018-02-14 23:29:57 You know what's fucked up about mass shootings, instead of guns getting banned or regulating them to a harder process to get them, gun sales go up even higher and stocks soar. Smh
133 2018-02-14 23:29:50 Notice that nothing happened with bump stocks after Vegas. Never too soon to talk about it before it's forgotten. We have a gun issue that no other first world country has.
134 2018-02-14 23:29:36 @SenatorDurbin @RepHultgren 
1 Let's do something now!

Here is what I want:

Universal background checks in all states including background check. 
Mandatory mental health exam for ALL present and future gun owner. No bump stocks or supressors.
135 2018-02-14 23:29:08 Bump stocks have no place here.  Common sense. Resistance is based on next statement from anti/gun lobbyists being BB guns have no place here.
136 2018-02-14 23:28:44 Work with law enforcement on intelligent gun control. No one wants to take your guns @NRA. Just not give mentally ill individuals and criminals weapons and maybe no bump stocks which you agreed with for 10 minutes after LV.
137 2018-02-14 23:28:21 See which stocks are posting big moves after the bell.
138 2018-02-14 23:28:16 #floridaschoolshooting worst since Sandy Hook in 2012

What meaningful #gunsense laws have been enacted since then? NONE

We haven’t even banned bump stocks after the Vegas mass shooting.

What will we do now? NOTHING ... except brace ourselves for the next one. #GunControlNow
139 2018-02-14 23:28:08 Nomura Instinet analyst points to Michael Kors and Tiffany & Co. as bargain retail stocks.
140 2018-02-14 23:28:01 So my day on the stocks started out shit, but some how, idk how, but some how I ended up in the green. Smh
141 2018-02-14 23:27:59 I just want sensible gun control--no bumb stocks, no high capacity mags, no AR 15s, background checks, etc.  Oh, and a reasonable Supreme Court.  Not asking for much.
142 2018-02-14 23:26:45 The country has moved on.
143 2018-02-14 23:26:42 Not only will it not stop, you can bet stocks will rise for gun manufacturers. Fox and the right are masters at using mass shootings to stoke fears about gun bans, sending thousands to their local gun shops.  Happens every time.
144 2018-02-14 23:26:38 @TheYoungTurks I understand the argument against bump stocks but they are trigger assists, you can’t ban them. You need regulation on fire rates, you’re fighting the wrong fight guys

#tytlive

146 2018-02-14 23:25:20 Probably with bump stocks. Just guessing.
147 2018-02-14 23:25:17 Bump Stocks are still legal
148 2018-02-14 23:25:11 Delete stocks just to re-stock
149 2018-02-14 23:24:55 You are full of shit. Talk to all the people that still own “legal” bump stocks.
150 2018-02-14 23:24:51 What ever happened to outlawing bump-stocks after Las Vegas??
151 2018-02-14 23:24:49 Adults must stand up and demand better background checks, ban on assault weapons and bump stocks, and closing gun show loopholes!  How many children have to be killed before we wake up???
152 2018-02-14 23:24:45 @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan shame on you AR-15's killing our kids in schools. bump stocks still for sale after Vegas. So tone deaf you pass legislation to conceal carry in every state. No gun registries but SNAP needs food boxes delivered?! HYPOCRITES
153 2018-02-14 23:24:37 A #BlueWave in 2018 would be a helluva start. Democratic Congress could craft some sort of proposal that DT would be pressured to sign since common sense gun control measures (no bump stocks, closing sales loopholes, etc.) is immensely popular. NRA is paying GOP to pray.
154 2018-02-14 23:24:31 He used an AR-15. We can no longer be angry at this ineffectual Congress. We need to get it done ourselves. Vote out any member of Congress that accepted money from the NRA, and will not vote for common-sense gun reg. (ban on semis/bump stocks, background checks, etc.)
155 2018-02-14 23:23:37 And then the markets shoot higher! No but zing zang zoop zap  Small bets. you want other people to say Buy buy buy, We want prices to go up; but sometimes they go down.  Then back up. And UP. then DOWN DOWN DOWN.  We say sell stocks buy gold silver waitout the debt reset 100%
156 2018-02-14 23:23:27 #Congress didn't even outlaw bump stocks after Las Vegas and their just a device to make semi-auto rifles more deadly. They certainly won't do Jack about a school shooting.
#thoughtsandprayers
157 2018-02-14 23:23:23 When you ban assault rifles, bump stocks, open carry reciprocity and require a national gun owner license and registry, then I’ll believe you. Eliminate @NRA political donations.
#GunLawsNOW @MomsDemand @shannonrwatts
158 2018-02-14 23:23:02 If you want to keep America safe you would support comprehensive gun control, ban assault rifles and end the sale of high capacity magazines and bump-stocks. 16 kids are dead today because of your cowardice and inaction! #ParklandSchoolShooting
159 2018-02-14 23:22:55 Well they have winning strategy.

Gin up the base, hit the talking points, and if there's a shooting, delay addressing it (now's not the time for politicizing the deaths or something of the like) until the policy window closes and nothing gets done.

Bump stocks still legal FYI.
160 2018-02-14 23:22:55 Bump stocks don’t make it automatic if it did I would to get a tax stamp from the gov for a lot of money
161 2018-02-14 23:22:54 needs high capacity clips/magazine, or bump stocks or AK 47/AR 15s. Some kind of way to check out mentally ill.  So much more can be done. Close online gun sales without background checks.
162 2018-02-14 23:22:14 It is time for ban on assault weapons and bump stocks, better background checks, and closing gun show loopholes!  My  goes out to victims and families!
163 2018-02-14 23:22:10 No one NEEDS an AR-15. But more than that absolutely NO ONE needs high-capacity clips, bump stocks, etc. There are dozens of simple, common sense things that could be done that wouldn't infringe on gun owner's rights. Something has to change. I feel sick.
164 2018-02-14 23:21:55 Do something Marsha, Take the lead and at least get options discussed. When we understand the facts later on lead us forward, I am pro gun but something has to change for example bump stocks are still available...
165 2018-02-14 23:21:46 penny stocks. lol
166 2018-02-14 23:21:40 @ChuckGrassley Stop taking blood money from the NRA.  This is on you for not standing up to the NRA and getting guns off the street. You must act NOW, there is NO reason for anyone to have a assault rifle, NONE.  Where is action on bump stocks?  Act Senators ACT.
167 2018-02-14 23:21:28 I own both and I don’t think you can ban them in any way that would survive a constitutional challenge. Things like Bump stocks and reset triggers should be illegal.
168 2018-02-14 23:21:26 I probably can make a lot of money by investing in stocks, but I don’t want to take that gamble of a crash.
169 2018-02-14 23:21:17 Guys. Kroger literally stocks the roses and chocolate right next to the entrance. Your bf was going there to buy beer anyway. Don’t get too sentimental.
170 2018-02-14 23:20:35 A country that cannot even bring itself to ban bump stocks after 59 were gunned down.
171 2018-02-14 23:20:32 features, (no flash suppressor, silencers, (detachable stocks to shrink them), bayonet, or long foregrip, others are fine being comfort based. A 3 day wait, background check and 21+ age...we are past being able to just ban firearms and not have it bite us back. A step of reasoned
172 2018-02-14 23:20:21 I really wish I could take money from my Roth IRA and use to buy some crypto. I like investing in traditional stocks but I want more options.
173 2018-02-14 23:20:12 Does anyone remember seeing/reading about stocks? Punishment where criminals' hands and feet are secured, and passers by can show their ridicule and more. We need a return of this punishment method.
174 2018-02-14 23:20:11 I watched him live. My  is breaking for the victims and their families. Congress must institute better background checks, ban on assault weapons and bump stocks, and close gun show loopholes immediately. That does not infringe on First Amendment rights. Our kids ave rights!
175 2018-02-14 23:19:58 Bump stocks are still legal
176 2018-02-14 23:19:54 I don’t recall you doing anything about bump stocks after the last tragedy. How will this one be different?
177 2018-02-14 23:19:41 There's no one answer to these horrific carnage events. In the case of students they get their weapons from home - unlocked up. In the case of older white males, they get them anywhere. Bump stocks should be outlawed. Same with assault weapons and silencers. Just for starters.
178 2018-02-14 23:19:28 Remember, when @SpeakerRyan puts out his "thoughts & prayers" to victims & their families for the latest gun related mass murder/shooting, bump stocks are still legal because he's a morally bankrupt PoS who won't let it come up for a vote. Along w/ALL kinds of other legislation.
179 2018-02-14 23:19:22 Lmao there’s no way you have 20k to srop on stocks fam
180 2018-02-14 23:19:20 Do any of my twitter friends know about which assets to choose in your 401k bc I’m clueless. I don’t know anything about stocks.
181 2018-02-14 23:19:14 we characterize conservative opposition to doing *anything* as doing nothing. we're not calling for abolishing 2nd amendment. we literally said "background checks? bump stocks?" and the right screamed noooooo.
182 2018-02-14 23:19:04 Nebraska’s trio of congressmen and our state GOPpers won’t even ban bumper stocks-
183 2018-02-14 23:19:03 Of course. Very few are advocating banning guns outright. But the problem is NRA is so powerful, we can't even ban obvious things like bump-stocks.
184 2018-02-14 23:18:14 Bump Stocks raise these children?
185 2018-02-14 23:17:47 I second that.  We will remove walmart's HEB's and even kroger's safety net. Begin to sell stocks if goes through. However organics might be lower price.
186 2018-02-14 23:17:42 Aussie market off to a solid start following positive lead from Wall St. #ASX 200 +46pts or +0.8% to 5887. Mining stocks standing out. $BHP & $RIO making the biggest difference #ausbiz
187 2018-02-14 23:17:41 Hardly @AmirAdnani s fault people dont buy gold stocks at the moment.
188 2018-02-14 23:17:10 0   doubt they are loading it with C5 or something they need for petchem - LOOP probably does not have the stocks. GoM production should be the easiest to export so why not export it if they get couple of more bucks for Mars.
189 2018-02-14 23:16:51 And since Las Vegas the ATF has been more interested in taking more action to regulate bump stocks. Hell, even the NRA said it believes that devices that enable functioning like full-auto should be more heavily regulated.
190 2018-02-14 23:16:31 If those grim reapers were held liable for the cost of all the mayhem their products produce maybe they'd change. Glad 2 see gun stocks down
191 2018-02-14 23:16:23 I'm with you on the regulation though, there are common sense laws that could easily tackle the low hanging fruit.  Then we can have arguments about the need for guns beyond that.  But hell, we couldn't even ban bump stocks after Las Vegas.  ZERO NEED FOR A BUMP STOCK
192 2018-02-14 23:16:13 What will they blame this time? Can't be 'bump stocks'!
Maybe it was.....
Checkered pistol grips?
Or.......
Tritium inlaid sights?
I'm calling for a immediate ban on gun emojis! To stop this needless killing.
193 2018-02-14 23:15:47 Ya?  Enough to vote for NO ASSAULT WEAPONS, BUMP STOCKS?
194 2018-02-14 23:15:30 Right, and GUN CONTROL background checks, would of not worked. Because he had no record of any kind, infact they still never found his motive. Ban bump stocks if you want, it won't fix anything.
195 2018-02-14 23:15:30 Can someone tell me what the purpose of Bump-Stocks are other than being able to kill more people in a shorter amount of time?
196 2018-02-14 23:15:22 Here we go again. “Thoughts and prayers”.  

Here’s a “thought” Republicans:  gun control.  Universal background checks. Ban the sale of bump stocks.
197 2018-02-14 23:14:35 Steven Paddock got his guns legally along with the legal bump stocks. We are the only country in the WORLD that has this problem. Try to figure out why.
198 2018-02-14 23:14:16 Yes, they do. Because every single time there’s a mass shooting, gun stocks skyrocket, and gun manufacturers take those profits and donate them to the NRA.
199 2018-02-14 23:13:43 Explain. I don’t know what you’re talking about.  If bump stocks are your solution go for it. Eliminate them. No problem here.
200 2018-02-14 23:13:32 Nation wide Background checks and waiting periods for both handguns AND rifles, put a limit on magazine capacity, male bump stocks illegal, put limits on ammunition sales, make it illegal for people on the no-fly list to purchase/possess a gun, just a start...
201 2018-02-14 23:12:55 Its a wonderfully simple stock market-ish game. The stocks never go down, haha. The route building is less important (still important, as the routes increased the stock value) but there's so much wonderful opportunity to read the people at the table and steal a critical lead.
202 2018-02-14 23:12:41 Hey least bump stocks are illegal now...oh wait.
203 2018-02-14 23:12:30 They can't even ban bump stocks. They will continue to do nothing.
204 2018-02-14 23:12:13 You mean, you're watching Fox reporting live, right? While putting a few bucks in weapons stocks ...
205 2018-02-14 23:11:56 Size 12
206 2018-02-14 23:11:44 Okay Jim, saying stocks are cheap is Silly.
207 2018-02-14 23:11:09 Hello @JoeNBC Stocks are up and don’t jinx tomorrow morning
208 2018-02-14 23:10:48 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
209 2018-02-14 23:10:17 Hey, remember that time every reasonable person in the country agreed that there was no legitimate reason for bump stocks to be legal, and no Constitutional issue with banning them?

And remember how the attempt to actually ban them withered on the vine after the NRA opposed it?
210 2018-02-14 23:09:09 They still sell the bump stocks used in the Vegas shooting..
211 2018-02-14 23:09:06 I guess I missed the part of the Second Amendment about bump stocks and AR-15s
212 2018-02-14 23:09:01 I moved to RBC and questrade but now I am back to using TD.... Questrade charged high ECN fees for penny stocks and RBC's direct investing platform is probably the worst.....
213 2018-02-14 23:08:54 Friggin bump stocks? Gimme a break unreal
214 2018-02-14 23:08:24 Try doing his strat without being in his room and the stocks won't move. He calls out low volume stocks and pumps them up with 1000 members
215 2018-02-14 23:07:39 Oh my lol that would be the biggest bullcrpa of a room i have been in. Sean is great talker and presenter for sure. But he pumps stocks.
216 2018-02-14 23:07:26 Sensible gun law reform is something most Americans agree with.  I think we should be able to have a gun with solid background checks and gun safety courses.  We do this with getting a drivers license no one needs uzi’s and bump stocks and anything that our police or military use
217 2018-02-14 23:07:11 Those adverse to any changes in gun control continue to the excuse that guns are available no matter what laws are imposed. Am I dense in thinking laws as universal background checks, ban of automatic assault rifles, bump-stocks, etc. would have an impact lessening gun violence?
218 2018-02-14 23:07:01 Absolute madness! Congress can't even rid the country of bump stocks they make me sick!
219 2018-02-14 23:06:51 Elle était trop belle, mais j’ai pas pu lui offrir de roses à cause des magasins qui ont pas prévu assez de stocks 
220 2018-02-14 23:06:31 They still sell the bump stocks used in the vegas shooting..
221 2018-02-14 23:05:51 The chief beneficiaries of the tax cuts are owners of corporate stock, a group that includes tens of millions of people whose pensions, 401Ks, etc., are in stocks.
222 2018-02-14 23:05:24 This is because FAANG stocks are morphing from great tech stocks to great stocks.
223 2018-02-14 23:05:24 I’ve been wondering if u would invest in any of the pot stocks.  They certainly ran like crazy in December
224 2018-02-14 23:04:41 Arghhhh cocaine stocks hahahaha
225 2018-02-14 23:04:36 But when you don't even do a root cause anylisis you can't get answers. However we know easy access to deadly wepons makes it worse. Bump stocks, extended clips etc.
226 2018-02-14 23:04:29 That’s right, just let everyone have the guns and wring our hands every few weeks when KIDS ARE KILLED IN THEIR SCHOOLS.  How about stricter gun laws? How about a ban on bump stocks? How about ANYTHING that may help the situation?!
227 2018-02-14 23:04:03 People used to think it was impossible to take down Big Tobacco. And no, not all the guns. Enough to make a difference though. Close loopholes, create mandatory waiting, make smart guns/gunsafes, get rid of bump stocks. We do literally nothing right now. Is it worth it?

Market wisdom by #HarveySawkin on Ep. 75 of the #InvestLikeTheBest Podcast:

"In a bull market,understand that valuation levels can go beyond your comfort zone.  Certain stocks will emerge as the leaders of the bull market. U gotta ride 'em."

236 2018-02-14 22:59:59 Many of the stocks you cover are about to have weekly descending macd crosses as I'm sure you are well aware of.
237 2018-02-14 22:59:54 I've never purchased a firearm without a background check. Nowhere, not ever. I don't understand what you're proposing.

Bump stocks are stupid. You don't even need one of them to actualize the same effect. But yeah, sure. 

Go on, please. Genuinely curious what would come next.
238 2018-02-14 22:59:12 a week ago...every market expert said too expect the worst...now...buy, buy, buy...goes to show you the experts don't even know what will happen. they make it up as they go along like everybody else. #stocks #crypto

247 2018-02-14 22:56:17 They pulled bump stocks from Walmart marketplace in October last year. Your Vegas shooter got an easily accessible add on to increase his rate of fire.
248 2018-02-14 22:56:08 You can say that again! "It was billed as one of the most important pieces of market data points for years, but the US core CPI print has failed to live up to the hype" (IG Market's @ChrisWeston_IG) #ausbiz #XJO #investing #stocks #equities Much Ado About Nothing...
249 2018-02-14 22:56:08 Well, automatic weapons are banned, bump stocks are in a tricky legal status, you can't buy most truly military grade weapons without pretty extreme vetting and expense if at all. "Assault weapons" are just hunting rifles with lots of black plastic, seriously.
250 2018-02-14 22:55:55 Gun control? 
Enhanced mental health services? 
Bump stocks? 
18 school shootings in 45 days? (WTF?)

America, this cannot be our norm. 
251 2018-02-14 22:55:17 Anyone want to debate the premise that casualties can be reduced if
- No semi-auto rifles?
- No large clips?
- No bump stocks?
252 2018-02-14 22:55:08 Shit I’ll take early 2016...go precious metals and pot stocks!  $EVIO...$AKG...etc.
253 2018-02-14 22:54:47 And large clips, bump stocks, conversion kits, and all other accessories that alter weapons
254 2018-02-14 22:54:45 Vote out every single person in our government who won’t stand up for our children and stop this horror. Gun control   NOW. They even stopped any forward movement on bump stocks. They have to go.
255 2018-02-14 22:54:33 OK with restricting bump stocks, but let's not pretend they're commonly used. An AR-15 even with one is 1 trigger pull, 1 shot, although it does provide a possibly over-the-line advantage (they were made for the handicapped). Military weapons are 3 shot bursts or fully automatic
256 2018-02-14 22:54:23 we played for like 30 stocks idk what you're talking about. You feel the need to bring her/me down every opportunity you can because that one night made you so mad that you think about it every day and you probably swore to yourself you'd do everything in your power to ruin it
257 2018-02-14 22:54:12 This must stop!  My  goes out to victims and families. We must have better background checks, ban on assault weapons and bump stocks, and close gun show loopholes now!  That does not infringe on 1st Amendment rights!
258 2018-02-14 22:54:07 Las Vegas. What? You dont think bump stocks count?
259 2018-02-14 22:53:58 most likely the student who attempt this will be shot by shooter and also 
these are kids not SWAT teams 
you might be facing an adult shooter with bump stocks

261 2018-02-14 22:53:27 Good evening and good morning.I am feeling relieved when stocks prices stop swooning.

263 2018-02-14 22:52:22 Universal background checks and banning bump stocks would be a start
264 2018-02-14 22:52:15 No they shouldn't; do your job and get behind assault weapons ban! In addition ban large capacity magazines and bump stocks. Start with this
265 2018-02-14 22:52:01 School shootings have nothing to do with diversity or homogeneity. The right to bear arms is limited and there is no rational justification to allow semi-automatics, assault rifles, or bump-stocks in a civilized society. Let's start there.
266 2018-02-14 22:51:25 Btw, eliminating bump stocks is your answer to these people killing others.
267 2018-02-14 22:51:19 $ATHX all my stocks green today except for the one that is going to make me very wealthy
268 2018-02-14 22:51:08 Someone tell him there’s Republicans in charge so if bump stocks are still legal then nothing will happen.   That’s a Republican America.
269 2018-02-14 22:50:24 good stocks/crypto coins are very underrated gifts

271 2018-02-14 22:50:04 The Las Vegas shooting was 4 months ago. Congress still hasn't banned bump stocks, which effectively turn guns into automatic weapons, the most modest action possible. 

Their policy is to do nothing.
272 2018-02-14 22:50:01 Big growth today in my stocks after a down week last week! Up 6.67%! #investing #stocks
273 2018-02-14 22:49:58 My  goes out to the victims and families! Congress needs to immediately address assault weapons, bump stocks, better background checks and close gun show loopholes. Those are not depriving anyone of their 1st Amendment Rights!
274 2018-02-14 22:49:53 You are correct but until your party does something about the arming of America every student , every teacher, and every parent will be fearful every day. Remember Las Vegas or have we forgotten already? And your party hasn’t even banned bump stocks yet.
275 2018-02-14 22:49:48 Gas prices are still hovering around the same, food is negligible. You must not make very much money if you’re not seeing a tax cut. Let me give you some advice, go learn a trade, get good at it, hire someone, buy stocks. Did your mommy and daddy not teach you anything?
276 2018-02-14 22:49:17 When the right to bear arms was conceived, the most advanced weapon was a musket. It shot one bullet at a time and took several seconds to reload. That is not what we have now. NO ONE NEEDS AUTOMATIC WEAPONS OR BUMP STOCKS. BAN THEM.
277 2018-02-14 22:49:16 Gun stocks will rise because of this shooting, which is sad. The NRA is a piss of shit organization that controls these pieces of shit politicians.
278 2018-02-14 22:49:11 I’ve been a moderate on gun control for a long time believing that guns for hunting and protection can coexist with firmer gun control (no bump stocks or high capacity mags for example) but the NRA’s lack of a conscience or reasonableness is driving me far left on it.
279 2018-02-14 22:49:08 3) Enforce current laws, ban automatic weapons, ban silencers and bump stocks,
280 2018-02-14 22:48:43 Opium wars are being played in Vancouver with made Fentanyl brought in by gangs to be sold on our streets to kill our children in order to get dirty  that needs to be laundered in prized in  VanRE to be later sold at profit like penny stocks while @bcndp 
281 2018-02-14 22:48:37 @StephenKing What do you want as a sane gun reg? Police only. If the Dems would accep a clean bill bump stocks they would be gone. Like DACA the Dems are more interested in issues than getting things done. #Shame
282 2018-02-14 22:48:25 Republicans have the majority in the Senate and the Congress and they won't even outlaw bump stocks.
283 2018-02-14 22:48:20 how really and truly can you live with yourself? How can you call yourself a Christian? What type of gun would Jesus have carried? The NRA certainly would not like HIM!! you really believe that the Founding fathers would want citizens to carry bump stocks, military weapons, etc?
284 2018-02-14 22:47:52 No one can stop it. But there’s plenty that can be done to make it harder for guns to get in the wrong hands especially long guns/lg mags/bump stocks. I’m  a gun owner and a firm believer in 2nd Am, but this is insanity!!
285 2018-02-14 22:47:46 1) Research the entire list of stocks/ companies that Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett, and Charlie Munger own.

Its all furniture companies , commercially driven entities , media, or a industry birthed from the industrial revolution....

286 2018-02-14 22:47:34 The reason that things like bump stocks failed is because they wanted to go after other measures.  They saw an opportunity for more gun control measures.  That's why it failed.
287 2018-02-14 22:47:13 Philip Mudd on CNN just now starting rambling about a failed terrorist car bombing, then said something about bump stocks, then shouted “A child of God is dead!” and broke down sobbing. I don’t blame him for being distraught, I’m distraught too. Just saying that was intense.
288 2018-02-14 22:47:06 @DavidBCollum CPI number and ancillary data poor across the board.  people sold bond funds and bought stocks.  don't shoot the messenger.
289 2018-02-14 22:47:03 Bump stocks or not he would still be able to shoot a lot of bullets.

291 2018-02-14 22:46:13 That Phil Mudd break down on @CNN was something. I don't doubt how genuine he was, but he was talking about interrogating an Islamic terrorist who was going to blow himself up to crying hysterically about bump stocks and gun control
292 2018-02-14 22:45:51 Ban bump stocks, military grade weapons, make ghost guns illegal require insurance
293 2018-02-14 22:45:31 I would add a qualifier... if he did not... maybe he did. I keep hearing UBCs would prevent this... FALSE. Semi autos are a weapon of war... False! Bump stocks... false...

295 2018-02-14 22:44:50 There's only one little issue with a broker working for capitalism in sin stocks. They like to do little white lines to keep up on the job. They miss everything in the global market dying around their addictions. It has a vanishing point in sight.
296 2018-02-14 22:44:50 @wsvn IF he used Bump Stocks then yes Congress you are guilty.

305 2018-02-14 22:42:11 If you really cared about the victims, you’d try to do something. Anything. You couldn’t even pass a bump stocks ban.
306 2018-02-14 22:41:54 Oh ok typical response...if thhe Vegas didn't jave bump stocks and an ar do you think he could have injured/killed that many? If say no you are a liar or you can't do math
307 2018-02-14 22:41:52 Yes, because clearly what is being done now is not working. And really, saying bump stocks are bad without following it up with lobbying doesn't mean shit.
308 2018-02-14 22:41:31 Someone name Dow Jones is really down about the stocks.  Don't know who that is but I feel bad... Everyone else is sad about it
309 2018-02-14 22:41:08 IMO they are reflecting it - graph SPX/TLT, note clear break out on LT chart that took place immediately after 2016 election.  When EM's have a BoP problem, ylds rise, stocks rise in local terms, & gold rises in local terms.
310 2018-02-14 22:40:56 i hope that all Repulicans stand by their previous position that it's too soon to talk about Gun Control. Bump Stocks....etc...
311 2018-02-14 22:40:53 After Vegas, zero was done abt. Bump stocks, guns etc.  Nothing will happen after today’s tragedy either.  America’s new slogan:  “Try not to get killed in a mass shooting. ‘Murcia!!!”.  #BrowardShooting #Murica
312 2018-02-14 22:40:29 Hope is barely hanging in for me. It’s just insane that they didn’t even ban bump stocks (which was allegedly backed by both sides) after Vegas. Instead they just waited until the news cycle moved on. Rinse, wash, repeat.
313 2018-02-14 22:40:27 They're calling last Thursday, "Black Thursday"... Kind of crazy! Definitely not the Bee's Knees! It wasn't that bad! My dad didn't invest in stocks and he is fine right now.
314 2018-02-14 22:40:21 What happened to getting rid of bump stocks that we ALL agreed to get rid of? Even Paul Ryan and LaPierre agreed.
315 2018-02-14 22:40:19 Actually the NRA released a statement encouraging congress and the ATF to address bump stocks. Keep in mind Bump stocks were administratively legalized by the ATF during the Obama years and have been legal since (10+ years)
316 2018-02-14 22:40:11 Stocks. Available in Walmart. Turns a gun into semi automatic and that’s legal to buy. That’s what your Vegas shooter did.
317 2018-02-14 22:39:53 Do you want to make some money out of capitalism? I can make you rich with it, give a broker at Goldman Sachs a call & ask about sin stocks in trading. They run the world on science, they also rig the policies of democracy with propaganda... that smart.
318 2018-02-14 22:39:46 It literally costs tens of thousands just to get a permit to buy an automatic weapon and tens of thousands to purchase an automatic weapon. Bump stocks dont make a gun automatic, they make it shoot faster. They are also very difficult to use and unreliable. Educate yourself.
319 2018-02-14 22:39:12 European stocks coming into a decent close up just over 1 % on average
320 2018-02-14 22:39:06 European stocks coming into a decent close up just over 1 % on average
321 2018-02-14 22:38:55 Restrictions, background checks, closing loopholes, banning people on the No-Fly List from purchasing guns, banning bump stocks & high-capacity mags, banning domestic violence perpetrators from CCPs, mandatory reporting when a gun is lost/stolen, etc etc etc
322 2018-02-14 22:38:28 No. One side does NOTHING but pander to the gun lobby. The other is begging for solutions to not have our children killed. I live in a state that just ruled NOT to make bump stocks illegal. Guess who is in control? Republicans. Gun deaths are not nonsense. They are senseless.
323 2018-02-14 22:38:21 As far as gun control I am definitely for making it harder for ppl to buy them with tighter restrictions and tighter background checks and stopping the sales of bump stocks, but I truly think a lot of it has to do with mental health and bullying
324 2018-02-14 22:37:46 Wait just a minute, you mean we didnt gives thoughts and prayers and talk about maybe banning bump-stocks for 5 minutes?
325 2018-02-14 22:37:26 $BTC.X is taking off again and with it all crypto related stocks! Nov/Dec 2017 2.0? Hopefully! $DPW $RIOT $MARA $LBCC $NETE $SSC $OSTK
326 2018-02-14 22:37:18 @petenajarian masiive selling in yield stocks, PEP, MCD, etc setting an opportunity up
327 2018-02-14 22:37:09 There's some mouthing off about bump stocks and then this "we urge Congress to pass National Right-to-Carry reciprocity".
328 2018-02-14 22:37:03 I have 0 hope that anything will ever be done about the gun massacre epidemic in America for many, many years until we get a competent and non-soulless Congress elected. If we couldn't get bump stocks banned after they wounded 500 people, we won't get anything
329 2018-02-14 22:36:59 Today was a risk on day where stocks and rates rallied. Previous days were risk off where bonds rallied while yields fell as a safe heaven.
330 2018-02-14 22:36:53 Melania. Your husband refuses to reform gun control. He even allows bum stocks for rifles. He is part of our mass shootings. He has blood on his hands. How can u be married to such a heartless man!
331 2018-02-14 22:36:52 Got the idea from the thumbnail, didn’t intend to copy. Used different fire stocks so it wasn’t a blatant copy and paste
332 2018-02-14 22:36:37 So you are OK with US citizens continuing to own guns? Just not bump stocks? I don’t know particulars about gun details, yet! I hope to own a gun soon.. but tough to save $$ in Dem run Cali, despite the great wealth Cali assumes, ya know...
333 2018-02-14 22:36:17 1. Smart guns
2. Ban AR
3. Ban bump stocks
4. Stop gun shows 
5. National regulations on gun purchases/background checks
6. Less money for the rich on tax cuts and more money for psych care 
THESE MAY NOT HAVE PREVENTED THIS ONE BUT SMART MEASURES THAT GUN OWNERS LIKE ME WANT
334 2018-02-14 22:36:06 Golly gee Mr Rubio. If only we had a body of elected officials responsible for making laws to protect our citizens. Who could mandate background checks to control who can buy  and own guns. Who couild outlaw things like bump stocks. If only
335 2018-02-14 22:35:54 Good rises for lithium stocks overnight. AJM Pls TAW have some good ground to recover.
336 2018-02-14 22:35:35 You said after Vegas it was too soon to talk about gun control. It wasn’t too soon for the NRA to buy the votes to continue to allow the sale of bump stocks. It’s been 4 months since Vegas. It’s time. We’re holding you, Congress and the NRA responsible from this point forward.
337 2018-02-14 22:35:25 Don't marry your stocks.
338 2018-02-14 22:35:14 Apparently bump stocks must be the solution given that Congress has done NOTHING. Thanks, NRA.
339 2018-02-14 22:35:06 For all mass shootings to end you have to take all the guns away. This is what @jaketapper @wolfblitzer and Dems want. Banning bump stocks and mental health laws wont do it #stonemanshooting

349 2018-02-14 22:32:25 Bump stocks.  Can we start with banning bump stocks?  Just start SOMEWHERE????  

And then we go from there.  One step at a time.

Cause this doing nothing is getting really frustrating for us regular folk.
350 2018-02-14 22:32:04 @DayTradeWarrior Hi ross can you please make a video that how to trade or manage time while working full time? Thanks
351 2018-02-14 22:31:55 This is the 18th school shooting this year and it’s only the middle of February. 80% of Americans want something done about these guns yet nothing has been done even after Las Vegas they still sell bump stocks that make a rifle an automatic weapons SAD
352 2018-02-14 22:31:27 The legalization of bump stocks is a loophole in which people can essentially obtain automatic rifles. The gun show loophole allows countless people to purchase guns without background checks.
353 2018-02-14 22:31:09 GOP sends it's thoughts and prayers for the thousandth time and the Kremlin owned NRA is having another school shooting sale on bump stocks and ammo. 
The killing won't stop until the GOP is voted out of all public offices. 
GET A CLUE VOTE BLUE !
354 2018-02-14 22:30:32 yup, they care more about bump stocks then they do of children.
355 2018-02-14 22:30:13 Steve Scalise shot up by an AR 15, almost died but there he is still supporting the NRA and bump stocks..he and Congress won’t support gun control laws...
356 2018-02-14 22:30:11 Why do vampires hoard stocks? Because they’re terrified of stakeholders.
357 2018-02-14 22:29:56 I heard the congressmen talking about the bill to outlaw bump stocks but as usual being a liberal he forgot to include all the other thing they wanted to out law. Give the anti gun liberals an inch and they will take a mile. They would love to seize every gun in the us. NO WAY.
358 2018-02-14 22:29:33 HEY REPUBLICAN VOTERS! Are your Repubs gonna share their NRA money with you? Or was one of the kids shot yours? They wouldn't even ban bump stocks after Vegas shooting.  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
359 2018-02-14 22:28:47 Gonna have to say, fucking pass on stocks and good luck with them
360 2018-02-14 22:28:45 The NRA also pays off politicians to not pass legislation that would lead to gun show loops closing, bump stocks not being sold, magazine size being restricted, and stricter background checks. 

The NRA is a terrorist organization. Take your 2 followers and fuck off.
361 2018-02-14 22:28:45 Exactly and Congress hasn’t been able to do anything about it.  Ridiculous!!!  Btw has congress outlawed bump-stocks yet after the Las Vegas shootings???
362 2018-02-14 22:28:38 A Smash 4 tournament but its 5 stocks, all customs, random character select, round robin into triple elimination, no shield button, all the lights are off in the venue, someone ordered pizza but no one comes up to the front when the delivery guy gets there, Cloud only in doubles
363 2018-02-14 22:28:37 What it suggests actually is that stocks are a good place to make money (as most stocks are heals by wealthy people). That's good news, because anyone can own stocks. Save up and invest.
364 2018-02-14 22:28:12 No NRA money in Government! The NRA is buying those in charge of keeping America safe!
Violating your oath of office!
No Automatic Assault Weapons and No Bump stocks!
Thoughts and prayers don't stop bullets!
365 2018-02-14 22:27:27 Lol. No i had a lot but u ignored. Uni checks, fund cdc research again, ban bump stocks, assault weapons. No sale to dom violence or terror watch list.  And thats off the top of my head. But u can continue doing nothing and trying to stop ppl who want to do something. Bravo.
366 2018-02-14 22:27:15 @wolfblitzer Bump stocks ban will not stop shootings. Only way is to ban all semi automatic weapons. Which is what Dems want. #stonemanshooting
367 2018-02-14 22:26:30 Heard that the stocks fell!! I can't believe it, hopefully it can get better this weekend!  Let's not make this a bad Thursday!
368 2018-02-14 22:26:19 That's the best you got? No mental health checks? No backgound checks in ALL states. No jail time for owners who do not secure their firearms? No limits on clips?No bump stocks?
Owners have to be part of the solution. Prevent BEFORE  they get to the school.
369 2018-02-14 22:26:11 All Americans have Roth, 401k, materials, stocks, Simple IRA, 403b, SEP IRA, and Health savings account and all Americans are also benefiting with the opportunities to get a job and end this enabling and becoming self sufficient. The Stock Market raise is a good thing.
370 2018-02-14 22:25:41 It's interesting  how the stocks are in the market place but yet it's up for discussion. Bad publicity politicians.  Bad business practices
371 2018-02-14 22:25:30 Yeah more gun control. Let's not focus more resources on combatting mental illness instead. Only gun control we need is to stop mentally ill people from buying guns. That's it. No limits on bump stocks and all. People w/I mental illness dont do this stuff
372 2018-02-14 22:24:30 @redrock_bball @SmanSports who’s a better start tonight for FG% and stocks: Jarrett Allen or Adebayo?
373 2018-02-14 22:24:27 $PDOS we shall see what happens tomorrow... 14M VOL today 
374 2018-02-14 22:23:55 wants to purchase a firearm to have a mental eval. in order to get their gun license green lit. We also need to ensure that we up hold and strength current laws as there is not a need for bump stocks nor high capacity magazines.
375 2018-02-14 22:23:35 I agree! We need to kick the NRA out of politics!! Congress wouldn't even pass a bill to stop people on the terrorist list from purchasing guns. #SensibleGunLaws doesn't mean guns will be illegal, it means we will address their usage. Bump stocks are still legal to buy. 
376 2018-02-14 22:23:33 Thank you, sir!  Trying to help folks. Not just about stocks, as you know, but also education on HOW to do this! How to FIND winners. We both know it's quite a learning curve. Thank You for the kind words!
377 2018-02-14 22:23:17 Watch what happens to gun manufacturer stocks.  Their business dropped when Trump was elected.  Sales used to go up after these tragedies.  Will they now or do gun fanatics feel comfortable that Trump is spineless?
378 2018-02-14 22:23:00 We should always tag @NRA as the gun lobby. They only care about selling more guns not the constitution. Unfortunately something like this only spikes gun sales just like bump stocks after Vegas. Sick & depressing
379 2018-02-14 22:22:45 Hey someone run a Sm4sh major that's 3 stocks and Final Smashes on Medium

Great, thanks!
380 2018-02-14 22:22:37 My dad has been an avid gun shooter. He has many of them, and even builds custom gun stocks, BUT guess what. My sisters and I never had A CLUE where he kept his guns. I know they're in a safe somewhere AND they have safetys on them.
381 2018-02-14 22:22:30 Hey but at least we banned those bump stocks am I right?
382 2018-02-14 22:21:51 Bonjour! Pour le moment elles restent dans le temps. Ça sera selon les stocks également! 
383 2018-02-14 22:21:33 Yeah let's not talk about mental illness and enact more gun control. Limiting bump stocks and gets us nowhere! We need to combat mental illness first! Only gun control needed is not allowing those with mental illness to buy guns!
384 2018-02-14 22:21:13 Please begin to take action to prevent school shootings. You can start with banning assault rifles, bump stocks, and high capacity magazines. This is only a start but no reasonable person should disagree with these steps. I know your beliefs pretty much match mine so thanks!
385 2018-02-14 22:20:43 Market Close: MBS -42bps; DOW +253.04; NASDAQ +130.10; S&P 500 +35.69; 10yr Treasury 2.91%; Stocks rebound after concerns over CPI data and close well into positive territory.  MBS sank along with Titanic on the inflation news, netting yearly highs in Yields.
386 2018-02-14 22:20:30 GUN CONTROL LAWS? You’re hysterical.  They won’t even legislate f**king bump stocks.
387 2018-02-14 22:20:27 There is NO justification for the average person to have automatic weapons, no justification for bump stocks, silencers or weapons of war.

When 2nd amendment was written, it basically was referring to single shot smoothbore muzzle loaders.

#GunSense #Parkland #StonemanShooting
388 2018-02-14 22:20:14 Glad, shame it's only scratching the surface. And sadly the people that drive under the influence of drugs and without insurance, sure as hell don't care about having a licence either. Bring back the stocks..
389 2018-02-14 22:20:10 How about tweeting about mental illness instead of gun control only? Mental illness causes all this! Limiting bump stocks and all doesn't do shit! Only gun control is stop those with mental illness from buying guns. That's it.

391 2018-02-14 22:20:02 So why don't you do something why don't you get rid of bump stocks why don't you close the loopholes at gun shows there are things you can do and still own a gun
392 2018-02-14 22:19:46 Down here in Sarasota, we're watching and grieving. In another school district, I've got 5 & 7-year old grandkids. I am JUST LIVID AT THE NRA BLOOD MONEY DRIPPING OFF GOP HANDS. 
And tomorrow, gun & ammo sales & stocks will RISE.
393 2018-02-14 22:19:34 The resilient showing by stocks came as the Cboe Vix volatility index fell below its long-term average of 20, while US Treasuries sold off, pushing the yield on the 10-year note to a four-year high above 2.9 per cent.  FT
394 2018-02-14 22:19:28 Growth stocks recommended  including last night were strong.  Further significant gains likely.
395 2018-02-14 22:19:25 Also I'm going grocery shopping tomorrow, which is great, but the supermarket I frequent stocks my favorite juice aaaaaaaaall the way to the top and my short ass has to struggle every. damn. time.
396 2018-02-14 22:19:22 There are common sense actions to take that a majority agree with; ACT! Close boyfriend loophole, ban bump stocks, mandatory wait, BG checks
397 2018-02-14 22:18:55 I guess I’ll buy some stocks @RobinhoodApp with the money I would’ve spent on Valentine’s Day dinner/gifts #SinglesAwarenessDay #HappyValentinesDay
398 2018-02-14 22:17:46 Yep gun stocks are already after market.
399 2018-02-14 22:17:00 Ready to talk about bump stocks again? Shame on you.
400 2018-02-14 22:16:54 FOR SALE:
X-cross
Spanking bench
Stocks
Bondage chair for lightweight users (just take it)
Probably something else.
401 2018-02-14 22:16:44 Nothing happened after Sandy Hook.

We couldn't even take action on bump stocks after Las Vegas.

Over 20,000 gun suicides a year.

How many more have to die before we do something?
402 2018-02-14 22:16:16 No one's 2A right overrides ANY human's right to live, so GTFOH with your "my rights would be violated" bullshit.
NO ONE SHOULD OWN ASSAULT WEAPONS. BUMP STOCKS SHOULD BE BANNED AND DESTROYED.
Come at me, trolls.
403 2018-02-14 22:15:42 Couple stocks making new 15 week highs, above the 30 week moving average and higher then normal volume: $ATE.V $ADD.V $AKG.TO $CS.TO
404 2018-02-14 22:15:40 $ZN prime example as to why one of my rules is to not short gap downs and stocks with SSR. The better trade is often to wait for SSR to get triggered and look for the r/g long trade
405 2018-02-14 22:14:56 Play ur cards right and u can skip stocks and go straight into real estate
406 2018-02-14 22:14:49 Are NRA stocks rising?
407 2018-02-14 22:14:49 "How can we prevent all these mass shootings?!"
"Well, have we tried banning handguns?"
"What could we possibly do?"
"Or universal background checks?"
"We just feel so helpless!"
"At least ban bump stocks or high-capacity magazines?"
"I guess we'll just have to pray." #Parkland
408 2018-02-14 22:14:27 4 stocks to hold in China: China Molybdenum, Motia, Baba,tencent
409 2018-02-14 22:14:18 Parent Staging Area sponsored by the #GOP, #NRA, and #TrumpRussia

Gun stocks are up today.  #sad
410 2018-02-14 22:14:17 On Wednesday, the S&P 500 financial sector was among the best performers, while utility and real-estate stocks fell.  WSJ
411 2018-02-14 22:13:37 The GOP and NRA offered to ban "bump-fire" stocks after last year's Las Vegas massacre. The Democrats weren't interested and instead wanted to pursue something closer to a total ban.

Compromise starts with understanding you might not get everything you demand.
412 2018-02-14 22:13:36 Please retweet this list!
Disgusting that GOP has chosen $$$ over lives of innocent Children and People. 
The GOP changed law so the mentally ill can purchase guns. Bump stocks, Semiautomatic & military/police style weapons easily bought. Motive is sell more guns.
Vote them out!
413 2018-02-14 22:13:13 We can do things one at a time. Background checks: pass it on its own. Bump stocks: on its own. AR-15 sales: on its own. We don't need a bill with everything in it at once.
414 2018-02-14 22:12:46 @penny_stocks Please DM me.
415 2018-02-14 22:12:26 'thoughts & prayers' r empty. put the people/children of our Country Above the @NRA 's profits & ur GREED. @GOP= Greed Over People. Have you shared with your elderly, disabled, & homeless vets ur inhumane cuts to SS, Medicare, Medicaid & ending homeless Vets prog? bump stocks?
416 2018-02-14 22:12:26 i also holding a postion in $orcl and was getting little nervous.. but with you 2 looking at $orcl.. I am happy :)
417 2018-02-14 22:12:21 Debating whether or not I should open a savings account with this Black-owned bank or buy stocks with this little lump sum of money I'm getting at the end of this month 
418 2018-02-14 22:12:16 How do you decide which stocks to play a certain day or week? Have seen most of the names are usually the most volatile on that day/week that you select
419 2018-02-14 22:11:23 Vicki Campion can get fucked. Put the trollop in the stocks with the Beetroot. Both a party to the skullduggery and greed. #auspol
420 2018-02-14 22:11:15 Sally, lives on Aliso Serra with husband.

Put all their savings into maca root stocks. Can't retire.
421 2018-02-14 22:11:15 My stocks are flying through the God damn roof, son.
422 2018-02-14 22:10:57 Remember that there was a burgeoning consensus to ban BP stocks after Vegas, if people would just not "rush" into things?
423 2018-02-14 22:10:53 More people around me own Bitcoin than gold, stocks, or ANY other form of investment for that matter. Even people that can barely browse the internet were buying crypto at the peak. It's was a borderline frenzy.
424 2018-02-14 22:10:48 The market's fear index just gave the green light to this comeback today. All clear. All clear. Inflation and rising interest rates don't matter anymore. Buy stocks. Not me.
425 2018-02-14 22:10:36 My tweets are mostly positive, encouraging remarks about $LTC, $ICX, $TRX, $ZRX and $IFXY. Don't expect too much analysis. But if you want to feel good about the stocks we co-care about, give me a follow. To the moon. 
426 2018-02-14 22:10:32 So maybe you should man up and start doing something about this.  Start with banning assault rifles and bump stocks.
427 2018-02-14 22:10:17 I think we need to start with sensible things. Want a AR. Get a mental health check. Add a cool down period.  Limit large magazines to 30 rounds top.  Ban Bump Stocks. Get the low hanging fruit.
428 2018-02-14 22:09:52 no, the RUSSIAN/NRA/JR/ERIC  have said that: ..."these shootings  could be mitigated by a 'good 4-year old with a gun'...'guns don't kill  people'....'bump stocks are great for Hunters so their arms don't get  fatigued' and 'silencers are good to protect small children's ears".
429 2018-02-14 22:09:39 AMAT’s earnings though! #stocks #transistors #AppliedMaterials
430 2018-02-14 22:09:30 He really isn't. If you were a black billionaire who talked about stocks and smoked cigars he would love you. He just thinks those kinds of people are cool. I don't know where people got this "man of the people" shit. Trump is so far from a "man of the people" it's laughable.
431 2018-02-14 22:08:59 When Buffet said Gold is the 'ultimate' bubble, he meant the biggest and the last. Once confidence is ripped from govts then stocks. @DebraRo91758510
432 2018-02-14 22:08:43 Get rid of easy guns and bump stocks
433 2018-02-14 22:08:35 Nothing about assault rifles. Nothing about ownership of guns by people not in a well-ordered militia. Nothing about bump stocks. Nothing about disallowing background checks, licensing, limiting what kind of ammo or clips can be manufactured and sold.
434 2018-02-14 22:08:21 Vous êtes sportifs dans les limites fes stocks dispo les gars. Arrêtez de croire qu un arbitre peut jouer un match.
435 2018-02-14 22:08:18 I respect your rights. I just don't see a need for bumb stocks, which have been used in other human slaughters. Not giving up my rights either. However, feel need for some type of change. Our country is better than this. Again, IMHO.
436 2018-02-14 22:07:44 Einhorn is know for shorting stocks. And he doesn't pick them very well either.
437 2018-02-14 22:07:33 What's this we shit? You couldn't even get bump stocks banned
438 2018-02-14 22:07:27 Well only thing you do is don't sell it to people with mental illness. No need to restrict bump stocks and everything else. That doesn't get you anywhere
439 2018-02-14 22:07:16 Which reminds me, wonder how much @Barnaby_Joyce's stocks have gone down in Qld, his heartland. That's when his mates Christensen and Canavan will drop him like a hot potato.
440 2018-02-14 22:07:06 Is it still to early to talk about Bump Stocks. Don't talk about the right to life when you allow things like this to happen.
441 2018-02-14 22:06:57 And bump stocks are still legal..
442 2018-02-14 22:06:10 DO SOMETHING! Expand background checks, close loopholes, ban bump stocks & large capacity clips, require training and security technology, allow negligence lawsuits vs gun owners and manufacturers. Literally anything other than banning silencers and requiring CC reciprocity.
443 2018-02-14 22:05:50 DO SOMETHING. Ban Bump Stocks. Get rid of ghost guns. Add funding to the background check system. Close the Gun Show loophole. Ban assault weapons. Pretty much anything.
444 2018-02-14 22:05:31 Supply more funding to gun research (Congress has essentially banned fed funding), increasing waiting periods, smart gun technology, banning high capacity magazines and bump stocks (my boss introduced this legislation in FL & it hasn't even been heard once in committee)
445 2018-02-14 22:05:29 It’s a good day to own gun stocks.
446 2018-02-14 22:05:28 Since the suspect is in custody he should be marched through the streets of Florida. Put him in the stocks and each of the victim's loved ones getting their chance of cathartic punishment. Make a real fucking example of him.
447 2018-02-14 22:05:26 galaxy brain: buy soup stocks
448 2018-02-14 22:05:23 I agree that's reasonable. They need that gun control. Not mucj else as far as limiting bump stocks and all. That isn't going to get you anywheee
449 2018-02-14 22:05:05 Bump stocks need to be banned and confiscated.
450 2018-02-14 22:05:03 Thanks mate #YNWA
451 2018-02-14 22:05:03 How bout starting with Bump Stocks.
452 2018-02-14 22:03:59 You own gun stocks. I swear I remember and I can find a tweet from you happy about something that boosted your gun stocks
453 2018-02-14 22:03:58 Please ban bump stocks and gun shows. I know that you're one of the highest-ranking House Dems and these events must stop. Thank you.
454 2018-02-14 22:02:35 Les rapports concluent à un usage d'armes chimiques de façon plutôt claire, et certainement issus des stocks Syriens. Bien évidemment, les gouvernements russes et syriens ont essayer d'expliquer que c'était les rebelles qui étaient en cause, à travers une opération fasse flag.
455 2018-02-14 22:02:19 Not even the most basic legislation, to ban bump-stocks, has been discussed recently.
456 2018-02-14 22:02:00 @SpeakerRyan  Time to take steps to prevent school  shootings. You can start by banning assault rifles, bump stocks, and high capacity magazines. This is only a start. Congress is an embarrassment. You are supposed to be a leader, so lead!!!
457 2018-02-14 22:01:57 Do we have Vincent Adultman there for America? I hope he got time off from business and stocks market.
458 2018-02-14 22:01:29 Is this only cryptos or we can trade indices ans stocks??
459 2018-02-14 22:01:08 US gun stocks in for a Great Wall Street day @realDonaldTrump
460 2018-02-14 22:01:02 Awesome! Enjoy! #WACCOE
461 2018-02-14 22:00:49 I woke up today thinking about my father and stocks
462 2018-02-14 22:00:17 Whatever happened to regulating bump stocks something g even the NRA and Republicans agreed to look at.
463 2018-02-14 21:59:32 These people are mentally ill. In all these cases after the event they discover people knew there was a problem. I am for banning bump stocks, banning armor piercing bullets, back ground checks for private sales. But in NJ we already reduced mag capacity 15 rounds is not high cap
464 2018-02-14 21:59:32 that good good gun dollar, strong market, big market, bullets, bump stocks, strong market, lots of demand
465 2018-02-14 21:59:30 Instead of all these photo ops why don't u actually earn the salary ur paid. Another school shooting today. Can we see a tweet on what UR DOING about bump stocks? About gun control? About school shootings? #mn03 deserves a rep who does more than photo ops. #MoreThan50 #stribpol
466 2018-02-14 21:59:23 Not sure how the Fed calms the markets. Inflation rather ties their hands. If they don't hike, stocks might like it but they'll end up with a bond rout. If they do hike bond may like it but stocks won't. Gordian Knot
467 2018-02-14 21:59:17 Not bad at all mate!  And off to Anfield tomorrow to see 5 European Cups #Milnerwasawesometonight
468 2018-02-14 21:58:57 You are a moron and clearly don’t understand how the economy or companies work. WHY are buybacks bad? Do you know what happens in a company with LESS stock on the street? Do you know what companies DO with stock? Do you know how stronger companies & stocks help middle class? 1/2
469 2018-02-14 21:58:50 Ban on bump stocks, higher age limit to purchase guns, universal background checks
470 2018-02-14 21:58:31 U.S. bank stocks rally, analysts see more upside #money #is #king #crypto or #fiat
471 2018-02-14 21:58:25 Sorry but...fuck your prayers.  Why are bump fire stocks still legal?  Why does every republican fight to keep them legal? Why does the GOP pretend to give a shit when they sit and do NOTHING! Give me action! Do something about it!
472 2018-02-14 21:58:24 For those people blaming Trump for this incident...tell me this.

What had Obama down to change and fix the gun laws and issues? Nothing.

Trump was in favor of banning Bump Stocks
473 2018-02-14 21:58:20 Apparently you missed the words "common sense".
I have no interest in taking away guns. I'm talking about future sales.
Closing loopholes, getting rid of the ridiculous like bump stocks and suppressors; things that are completely excessive for hunting or target shooting.
474 2018-02-14 21:58:17 Predicting the GOP after praying & giving condolences to everybody will feel some heat about yet another school shooting will require metal detectors at all entrances to schools. Wall Street to push Metal Detection Companies. Stocks will go crazy. That’s what USA does. #Impeach45
475 2018-02-14 21:58:11 @SenRonJohnson It is time to take a position in favor of common sense gun control. You can start with banning assault rifles, bump stocks, and high cspacity magazines. This is only a start. Get to work.  Congress is a national embarrassment!
476 2018-02-14 21:58:03 the fact that Hillary stored some apparently classified email on her private server was such a big deal that we had to elect a guy who stocks his White House full of people who handle classified material on the regular even though they're too compromised to get a clearance
477 2018-02-14 21:57:35 only in this country do we have this many fatalities due to a document now misinterpreted by the Supreme Court for political reasons. A well armed militia. Where does that mean unfettered individual access to any guns, not to mention bumper stocks. So freaking sad.
478 2018-02-14 21:57:32 DO SOMETHING. Ban Bump Stocks. Get rid of ghost guns. Add funding to the background check system. Close the Gun Show loophole. Ban assault weapons. Pretty much anything.
479 2018-02-14 21:57:09 Bump stocks. Limit the “Arsenal” a person can build up. Responsible gun ownership is a right and a privilege
480 2018-02-14 21:56:17 I hit my strike price in my $CSCO call today.  Earnings, guidance, dividend raise and stock buyback all look positive.  I think I'll stay in a little longer #stocks #options #cash #money

482 2018-02-14 21:55:16 Bump stocks for one. Maybe ppl assembling massive arsenals. Assault weapons being illegal (like they were under Bush till they let it expire). There are things to look at, but ur free to do nothing.
483 2018-02-14 21:55:14 Jim Cramer said, "interest rates dont matter", the "vix technical situation" is over, just buy stocks......................
484 2018-02-14 21:54:54 Hello! Based on Yesterday's Stock Market Close - 2018-02-13, these stocks have sell signals based on a Mean Reversion Strategy (6/6):
485 2018-02-14 21:54:53 Hello! Based on Yesterday's Stock Market Close - 2018-02-13, these stocks have buy signals based on a Mean Reversion Strategy (6/6):
486 2018-02-14 21:54:40 I would swap the order of stocks and real estate...and caveat it with only apartment buildings. Check out some @GrantCardone content!
487 2018-02-14 21:54:23 Awesome, then she'll have to pick up crumbs. By the way will she give back her tax break and any profits from new economy like stocks or 401k..you bet your ass she won't. But maybe we'll get lucky and the fifth of vodka per day will turn into a gallon
488 2018-02-14 21:54:16 War only benefits those who owns stocks in military contractors, the rest of us merely die in them.
489 2018-02-14 21:53:59 and what has been done about bump stocks--PRAYER.
490 2018-02-14 21:53:57 Idon't know about you, but I don't get "crumbs" despite what Nancy Pelosi thinks. And you realize that a bulk of CEO pay is based on stocks. Do you want that? If so, your pay will become larger but also riskier.
491 2018-02-14 21:53:44 From TX. Gun owner. I want bump stocks outlawed. Agree. Guns don't kill ppl, ppl kill ppl WITH guns. Mind you, stricter laws would help keep guns out of hands of ppl who shouldn't have access. Imo.
492 2018-02-14 21:53:40 still waiting for "only good for mass killing" bump stocks to be banned.
493 2018-02-14 21:53:34 45 and pretty much all of Congress for generations have done nothing about common sense gun laws.  Bump stocks, ghost guns and assault rifles all still legal for anyone to buy with several loop holes around vetting.  Our government allows this two happen.
494 2018-02-14 21:52:48 Absolute belter of a day in that there London with the @SmallBeerLtd team! Thanks to @EuroboozerMart & @SpyRight for showing us the sites. Some great accounts to drink @Stieglbrauerei .Looking forward to hosting your team in #Lincoln #GrandOldDukeOfYork #LearntRussian
495 2018-02-14 21:52:43 well bump stocks being illegal might have helped.
496 2018-02-14 21:52:32 Why people dont realize that if Buffett or whom ever bought a billion stocks in a company ,someone/s else has/have filled him(sold to him),which annuls the whole thing and makes it meaningless.Look at the momentum and just read the balance sheet. $TEVA

498 2018-02-14 21:52:16 When will you put lives first and and not votes! We need gun control of bump stocks, hand guns, semi automatic weapons and strict laws regarding automatic weapons.  STAND UP AND SAVE OUR CHILDREN!!! Make our school safe!!!!!
499 2018-02-14 21:51:53 Many of us don't see anti-gun regulation folks offering ANYTHING but "thoughts and prayers".

Remember the brief, bi-partisan push to regulate bump stocks after Las Vegas? Empty rhetoric.

Remember when O'Reilly said this type of mass murder was the price of freedom? 

Spare me.
500 2018-02-14 21:51:41 Prayers? Fuck that the time for action is now! Screen better to keep the mentally ill from getting guns. Get weapons designed for battlefield - even modified ones off the street for starters. Ban bump stocks.
501 2018-02-14 21:51:12 $NTAP shares falling more than 8% as it posted a #GAAP loss of 1.89 per share, but given this loss is related to a one-time charge of $856 million associated with U.S. tax cuts this might be a buying opportunity
#stocks #market #NetApp
502 2018-02-14 21:50:54 We still haven't done anything about Bump Stocks. Something simple to deal with. This isn't fair to our children.
503 2018-02-14 21:50:50 Get those bump stocks banned yet? Or is it still too soon to talk about those?
504 2018-02-14 21:50:49 @MeatPeter who stocks Hannan meats in Lisburn? Or do I have to come to moira?

506 2018-02-14 21:50:26 Hey @speakerryan 15th school shooting in 2018!  Where's that ban on bump stocks you talked about!??  DO YOUR JOB!  #Corrupt&Complicit
507 2018-02-14 21:50:00 1-Ban sale of military-style weapons/ammo.
2-Ban sale of bump stocks.
* Only purpose those items serve is to kill people.

3-Enforce existing law. 
4-Limit campaign contributions to minimize NRA influence. 

I’m not anti-gun. I’m anti-stupidity. Indifference is stupid.

508 2018-02-14 21:49:42 Wonder how Steve Scalese feels..he still supports the NRA and bump stocks.
509 2018-02-14 21:49:28 You do not have to give up your guns to ask for tougher laws on bump stocks. 
These turn semi-automatic guns into automatic ones.
510 2018-02-14 21:49:25 And bump stocks so that you can shoot even more people before anyone has a chance to react. And more assault-type guns that have large clips/magazines so they can fire off rounds quicker than anyone can possibly react to.
511 2018-02-14 21:49:25 Gold is back to the $1350 resistance level.  With inflation worries on everyone’s minds we could see it break through and rise for awhile. #stocks #Commodities #inflation #CPI
512 2018-02-14 21:49:25 I am sure that President Obama signed the Bill passing Bump Stocks to turn guns into machine guns.
513 2018-02-14 21:49:23 Nothing? He was in favor of banning bump stocks. 

What has Obama done to change and fix gun laws and issues?? Nothing.

515 2018-02-14 21:49:06 Fittingly, love every where today. The Dow up 253, the S&P up 36 and the Nasdaq ahead 130. After a.m. scare about strong CPI (+0.5%) stocks regained their equilibrium.  Investors parsed the #'s and saw inflation was unchanged for the past 12 mos. Breadth solid 2.2 and 4.8 to 1.

518 2018-02-14 21:49:01 It depends on the risk u wanna take. And how much you believe in what you’re investing in. When investing money do your own research, don’t ask other people what stocks to buy.  Find a few stocks or more that you feel are good companys and invest in them
519 2018-02-14 21:48:44 World stocks surge: US +1.3%; Europe +1.1%. Buyers rushed in after early inflation scare, convinced that the correction was over & upward market momentum was in play. With strong earning & solid economy it's a reasonable bet.
520 2018-02-14 21:47:51 that actually worked absurdly well today, gold was up about the same amount as stocks
521 2018-02-14 21:47:04 The BATF (agency that approves/prohibts gun accessories) started comment period on bump stocks. Process could take a yr+ industry appeals.

525 2018-02-14 21:46:45 I invested into Matica because they are one of the only pre-licensed producers which makes them one of the best stocks to invest in right now. Tell me how much money did investors make when other lps got their licenses heh. They made a lot...
526 2018-02-14 21:46:33 It changes when we stop pretending there are two sides to the gun issue.  We can begin with common sense gun reform like background checks, elimination of semi-automatic weapons and outlawing bump fire stocks.
527 2018-02-14 21:45:49 Top five most active stocks today were $BAC, $GE, $AMD, $CSCO, and $AAPL.
528 2018-02-14 21:45:29 What about children being gunned down at school?! You and everyone else in Congress should be held accountable for these senseless deaths!!! Do something! You guys couldn’t even outlaw bump stocks! Please do more than offer prayer #complicit
529 2018-02-14 21:45:13 Um, actually LOTS of people have been contacting their reps. For years. Its an extremely helpless feeling that the gun lobby is so overwhelmingly powerful that simple legislation like banning bump stocks or safety training can't even pass. So next suggestion?

534 2018-02-14 21:44:46 It’s legislative session.  How about a law to ban bump stocks?  A law about locking up your guns from minors?   A law that the parents can sue the gun seller?
535 2018-02-14 21:44:26 The top five stocks that gained today were $CMG, $IPG, $ALXN, $FCX, and $UAA.

543 2018-02-14 21:41:21 Children will not be safe until our  governmental officials take action to prevent school shootings. Stop praying and get to work. Start by banning assault rifles, bump stocks, and high capacity magazines. This is only a start. Get to work!!!!!
544 2018-02-14 21:41:05 according to the article in The New Yorker, "The economists Harrison Hong and Marcin Kacperczyk found that sin stocks outperform other stocks by 2.5 per cent per year" which I would consider a meaningful outperformance.
545 2018-02-14 21:41:04 no amount of gun control could have affected this outcome, but good thing we spent so much time and energy banning bump-stocks.
546 2018-02-14 21:40:40 500 people got shot in Las Vegas and they couldnt even ban bump stocks. Fucking joke country.
547 2018-02-14 21:40:37 Can we talk about Vegas yet?  AT LEAST BAN BUMP STOCKS! Do something!

557 2018-02-14 21:36:18 ah cool i see that having not checked twitter for like an hour i missed another school shooting... congrats @NRA, sure, some people died but at least your stocks got a boost, right?
558 2018-02-14 21:36:16 The next politician who sends "thoughts and prayers" but votes against common sense gun legislation should be put in stocks in the public square.

Customs with 3 or 4 stocks sounds mad fun tbh
569 2018-02-14 21:33:01 Not saying to get rid of all guns. But more vetting is a start. People with a history of domestic abuse should be banned. If you’re on a gov’t watchlist. Renewing a gun license more often. I still don’t get why those fingerprint triggers didn’t become a thing. No bump stocks.

589 2018-02-14 21:29:10 The GOP sends it's thoughts and prayers, for the 1000nth time. The NRA sends out discount coupons for bump stocks and ammo.
590 2018-02-14 21:28:50 Don't get me wrong, I'm a proud gun owner, but there are steps we can make to shore up this issue - e.g., banning high capacity magazines, bump stocks, increased background checks, & mental health requirements. The issue needs to be discussed outside of the NRA talking points.

594 2018-02-14 21:27:46 We have moved well beyond "thoughts and prayers" and "enough is enough!" TOTAL BAN on semi and automatic handguns, assault rifles, bumper stocks, oversize clips and bullets of mass destruction. It is time for "extreme vetting" of gunbuyers and extreme limits on NRA lobbying! NOW!

604 2018-02-14 21:24:41 Remember Vegas, where hundreds were shot and we made some hand-wave notions towards banning "bump-stocks" and then it all went away.

Anyways, this is the best country ever in the histroy of GOD and I'm still mad at those black players kneeling on the flag.

611 2018-02-14 21:23:35 Is anybody surprised? Please, no crocodile tears from those who have voted against ammo limits, outlawing bump stocks and outlawing semi and automatic weapons.
612 2018-02-14 21:23:19 you're aware things can CHANGE
gun CONTROL needs to be tweaked
we can't even get bump stocks banned
so "clearly" gun control needs amendment
background checks
for ALL sales
enforcement
saying something "isn't working" isn't the END
but we need a STARTING POINT
like NOW

615 2018-02-14 21:22:28 Background checks, waiting periods, not allowing the mentally ill to own weapons, banning bump stocks, bannning assault rifles. None of that violates the 2nd amendment. It just keeps them out of the hands that shouldn't have them and there is no reason private citizens need ARs
616 2018-02-14 21:21:34 We not gonna see nothing til Mid March watch. I watch maybe 10 mins then go back to my work. Work on other stocks.  Ceo may not announce nothing this week.
617 2018-02-14 21:21:28 I don’t recall you doing anything about bump stocks after the last tragedy. How will this one be different?
618 2018-02-14 21:21:06 Also, bump stocks fail more than they work. A trained shooter can fire faster using technique than any stupid gadget
619 2018-02-14 21:20:57 nope, it means if $TNX climbed to 4%, and #SPX climbed higher alongside, then TNX rises & SPX yield falls. So TNX at ~4%, !YLDSPX at ~1.5% & you'd then get a 2.6x multiple of cash flow in a 10 year. The higher the multiple, the more competitive the decision between Stocks & Bonds
620 2018-02-14 21:20:56 Make All assault style weapons illegal, make extended magazines illegal, make bump stocks illegal, tougher background checks and mental health screenings, and more. There is a lot you can do to prevent these situations from happening.
621 2018-02-14 21:20:50 And then you and the GOP turn around and don't pass any legislation to slow the shootings. Bump stocks? Sure, let 'em have 'em. Semi-automatics? Sure, why not. Everyone in America needs one. This is your fault Trump. November is coming.
622 2018-02-14 21:20:18 The fishermen sold their quotas to other European Fishermen, That is what destroyed their communities. Without EU fishing rules there would be very few stocks of fish left and because of their policy Cod numbers have now increased. The  value of the industry has increased.
623 2018-02-14 21:19:36 I’m not sure what gun this kid has, but I want to add that semi-automatics and bump stocks aren’t needed. Pistols should be the only guns sold legally to citizens in the US.
624 2018-02-14 21:19:07 In the USA, what is the best brokerage for buying stocks on foreign country exchanges?
625 2018-02-14 21:19:02 All the shootings do. We couldnt even muster up the guts to ban bump stocks after vegas.
626 2018-02-14 21:18:41 In case you were wondering, but who is left to buy stocks and keep the market alive?: "Hello, my name is Cisco I am gonna buyback $25B worth of stocks, yes sir, good day" $CSCO
627 2018-02-14 21:18:23 It would also help if you would look up the meaning of the words "militia" and "guns" in 1776. I don't think people had easy access to hundreds-of-rounds-per-minute semi-auto rifles with bump stocks and laser back then. If guns can evolve in 200+ years, regulation should as well.
628 2018-02-14 21:17:54 My adding to stocks while the SP500 was at 2580 is looking very profitable (now 2698.63). Small companies spearheaded today’s surge-I like that conviction. Is the market correction over? Time will tell, but I’m enjoying the movement. #Stocks #Invest

632 2018-02-14 21:17:15 Bump Stock Judi... Gotta be Bump Stocks....
633 2018-02-14 21:17:00 So do something, you sniveling moral zero!!! Universal background checks. Ban assault weapons, ban bump stocks. Ban high capacity magazines.  You can be a hero here. Or you can continue to be the worst president in American history. Your choice.
634 2018-02-14 21:16:55 Stocks close up on news that infrastructure will continue to crumble
635 2018-02-14 21:16:52 Bump stocks are useless.  Have you even tried one?  How are you going to get rid of the millions and millions  of guns?  We can't even control who comes into the US.
636 2018-02-14 21:16:25 Haven’t heard of bump stocks saving anyone’s life yet. It’s maddening.

638 2018-02-14 21:15:58 how about working w/congress to enact better gun registration and regulation, which includes a ban on assault rifles (military standoff weapons) , bump stocks, & large capacity magazines! You and congress are complicit in these mass shootings!
639 2018-02-14 21:15:52 Bump stocks are not the problem.

642 2018-02-14 21:14:55 And i invested in some stocks while i was at it  im a business man for real
643 2018-02-14 21:14:49 At least we acted and took care of the bump stocks that killed so many people in Las Vegas. Oh, wait, I guess not...
644 2018-02-14 21:14:27 Gun free zones don't Work, they are a magnet to every one who has a gun and wants to harm. Ban automatic guns, bump stocks. Then graded gun insurance(Rifles with highest premium) with only pepper bullets and non lethal defence having the exemption.
645 2018-02-14 21:13:42 It's too *early* since it's still too *early* after Las Vegas to talk about why bump stocks are still legal.
646 2018-02-14 21:13:37 Why should individuals be able to purchase bump stocks or military style guns? Why, please explain to me your reasoning.
647 2018-02-14 21:13:28 Look I am a gun owner and believe in the right to bear arms, and we don't know the situation down there yet, but there's no need for things like bump stocks, fully auto assault rifles or large magazines without some sort of regulations...and thoughts and prayers aren't enough.

653 2018-02-14 21:10:30 Just a reminder: Las Vegas shooter killed 58, injured over 500 ---- bump stocks are still legal.

And YES, THIS is the time for this reminder. Congress continues to do NOTHING.

656 2018-02-14 21:08:38 Stocks end broadly higher. Some analysts say "despite" higher inflation report. Could be *because* of inflation report. A moderate rise in inflation could = more pricing power for cos., better earnings. 
Dow +1.0%, +253 to 24,893
S&P +1.3%, Nasdaq +1.9%
657 2018-02-14 21:07:59 Did the GOP stop bump stocks after one was used in a mass killing. So don’t think the GOP will allow any gun regulations no matter how many kids die.
658 2018-02-14 21:07:39 remember last week when CNN was wall to wall with the melt down in stocks? almost giddy with how the downturn would b blamed on TRUMP economy/ WELL MKT HAS COME ALL THEWAY BACK/ DONT EXPECT ZUCKER TO TELL U THAT

663 2018-02-14 21:05:56 we can't even get bump stocks banned, something that has no purpose other than to inflict as much damage as a gun is capable of, so no I have no faith anything will be done.
664 2018-02-14 21:05:39 thrown into the stocks for drawing the homestar runner on all my petri dishes instead of labeling them

666 2018-02-14 21:04:33 the implosion of tether is a short term negative catalyst for all cypto stocks
667 2018-02-14 21:04:20 Yes but FED decreasing its balance sheet with $1 trillion by 2019 should be bearish. Stocks are forward looking. Fundamentals does not look good
668 2018-02-14 21:03:14 Both stocks SHOULD be up on this deal, IMO.
669 2018-02-14 21:03:02 Than do something about it. Like background checks for everyone to buy a gun, fingerprint ID for guns. 
Ban assault weapons.
Outlaw bumper stocks.
That would be a good start.

674 2018-02-14 21:01:48 Try to talking with the NRA on gun regulations.... Wait we still have bump stocks. This problem is bigger than guns but start somewhere
675 2018-02-14 20:59:50 Because common sense regulation like banning bump stocks, ending gun show loopholes, and prohibiting people on the No Fly list from buying guns is never implemented, despite mass shooting after mass shooting. Shouldn't we be thinking of sensible ways to prevent the next one?
676 2018-02-14 20:59:49 While ya’ll play hot potato with OG cards my gold, silver, & uranium mining stocks are only up more than 10% in 2 days. I reitterate my $gdx parabola call.

678 2018-02-14 20:59:22 Trite, meaningless platitudes. Will anything get done to pass some sensible restrictions on semiautomatic weapons, bump stocks, etc? Not as long as NRA has @GOP in its back pocket.

680 2018-02-14 20:59:09 Like how?  Banning bump stocks?  Better background checks?  They're investigating the circumstances around this shooting, but what are you doing to stop the next one?  Not what do you promise in speeches .. what are you actually DOING?
681 2018-02-14 20:58:47 Don’t worry folks all is righted in the world, #stocks r attempting to go parabolic again climbing wall of worry while #rates r spiking & $VIX is down big because all is now well, put the recent dramatic collapse behind you, nothing to see here. $SPX $ES $ZN $ZB $YM $NQ #sarcasm

683 2018-02-14 20:58:40 Bump Stocks?
684 2018-02-14 20:58:36 How many Stocks?
685 2018-02-14 20:58:13 There is a fiery place in hell for lawmakers who offhandedly offer ‘thoughts and prayers’ while our children get killed at their schools. Offer background checks. Offer laws against high capacity magazines and bump stocks. DO SOMETHING! Doing nothing isn’t working. #Parkland

687 2018-02-14 20:57:35 Seriously? Bump-stocks (Las Vegas shooting) are still legal.

703 2018-02-14 20:54:12 But we do. We feel unsafe.
And the vast majority of us also feel the issue is being completely neglected by the people we elected to solve these issues.
Bump stocks still legal
Gun show loophole still open
Universal background checks not implemented.
704 2018-02-14 20:54:11 Very sad and disturbing that the NRA, Russians, and Trump are running the Government!!

705 2018-02-14 20:54:02 What do stocks "fundraise" for? The companies? Does buying one count as a donation?

718 2018-02-14 20:50:48 Your right it is sickening. We will always have evil among us. But we can very easily fix the problem with a few laws.  That don’t infringe on 2nd amendment rights. But congress refuses to act. 50 people killed in Vegas. Nothing happened. Bump stocks still legal. Why??????
719 2018-02-14 20:49:43 Why yields so high-because economy is growing. Why stocks go high -because economy is growing. Why inflation go high - because economy is growing. Why gold goes high - because I don’t understand it ...

724 2018-02-14 20:47:50 Last year German stocks did better than US stocks - and the German economy was growing at a faster pace than ours. Even worse Frau Merkel repays debt while Trump added 666bn of debt last year.
725 2018-02-14 20:47:19 It's not inflation per se that could (should?) hurt stocks but high rates. Perhaps 10yr yield above 3% will do the trick.
As for your goldbuggery venture, bitcoin is better, and demographics suggest that the goldbug to crypto bug emigration is a one way street.

729 2018-02-14 20:45:20 Democrats are in favor of universal background checks, banning bump stocks, ending the gun show loopholes, etc etc.

744 2018-02-14 20:36:35 I mean I think that’s a personal opinion, the bump stocks, but in my opinion I’m kind of neutral. Bump stocks can be banned or not, the bad guy will attack in either way.

750 2018-02-14 20:34:08 Bump stocks need banned. Gun show loop holes. Theres alot to be done without "taking away" the guns.

760 2018-02-14 20:28:01 Just a reminder: Las Vegas shooter killed 58, injured over 500 ---- bump stocks are still legal.

And YES, THIS is the time for this reminder. Congress continues to do NOTHING.

771 2018-02-14 20:26:03 Do not waste your newfound tax money on hot dogs, beer, movies, or other lowlife personal gratification vices. You must purchase stocks and if not stocks then bonds and if not bonds then annuities or B-nnuities or perhaps some C-nuuities. Invest in America!!! J/K, thanks loser.
772 2018-02-14 20:25:35 Countdown to "not a time to politicize" comments from WH starts now.. Remember @ Vegas the pump-fire stocks were to be outlawed? If not now then when? #schoolshooting #EnoughIsEnough #GunControlNow
773 2018-02-14 20:25:31 Another day in America.....another active shooting at a high school. When is a good time to talk gun control? We still haven’t done anything with the bump stocks the Vegas shooter used. #EnoughIsEnough

781 2018-02-14 20:21:03 A4. WOC more likely to live below poverty line, have less home equity, fewer financial assets such as stocks. These inequities often blamed on education status, family structure, etc. But these are FALSE narratives. Wealth inequities are b/c of #HiddenRules

813 2018-02-14 20:10:12 imo the 1st step of moving from amatuer to pro trader is buying able to buy the strong stocks in their direction. Next is holding adding to winners and then holding through the breakout. I took $wb off at 134, its now $139.
814 2018-02-14 20:10:06 Maybe growth expectations, which stock market is focusing on, are just exaggerated. And when market focuses on higher bond yields due to expanding US deficit / national debt, stocks will decline rapidly @TFMkts @htsfhickey @jessefelder

883 2018-02-14 19:37:31 Depuis plusieurs années désormais, les stocks mondiaux d'adresses IPv4 ne cessent de réduire. En novembre 2016, Board (IAB), le comité en charge de la surveillance du développement d'Internet, a même indiqué que les stocks étaitent épuisés.
884 2018-02-14 19:36:47 Today in Financial History: 1936, outgoing NYSE president Richard Whitney embezzles $150,000 in bonds in order to cover loans made on penny stocks. He is caught 2 years later.
885 2018-02-14 19:36:35 High emotions and investing don't mix well. We must strive for balance. Take a breath. Walk away. This is a nice, long walk. Not a sprint. #stocks
886 2018-02-14 19:36:26 The Liberals need to legalize this quick because they all have stocks and shares in marijuana.
887 2018-02-14 19:36:20 Another “why aren’t you buying my favorite stocks?” question. 

We need a trap door.
888 2018-02-14 19:35:19 Fundamental metrics in many cases look pretty good but the question is how much the higher discount rate will influnce stocks' valuation. While 3% could be bearable if yields continue grinding higher and reach for one 3.5% it could be the other story at all.

894 2018-02-14 19:34:07 Guys ready for $SEDG earnings? I rarely hold stocks through earnings but if the profit cushion is there and the name is showing "the mother of all accumulation patterns" as I called it back in september 2017...You have to give it a shot. Know when to bend the rules!
895 2018-02-14 19:33:32 Dow Jones index unexpectedly rebounding on a continued basis, as it has done for a number of days. Stocks, I sold recently, run higher. Cash levels are higher than norm.  

Now require 1,000 point Dow setback to create some new opportunities. 

Still selling stocks into rally.
896 2018-02-14 19:33:16 I just want everyone to know I was such an overachieving nerd that I was in the “Stock Market Club” I’m third grade and would stay after school to learn about stocks and trading.
897 2018-02-14 19:32:14 I simply am not a 1, 2, 3 or 4 tic Flipper, I position myself with stocks, add when I can and wait for sustained uptrends~  I am not saying flipping isnt lucrative, but after 9 years of OTC trading, my best profits come from buying low, ave down if needed, and wait!
898 2018-02-14 19:32:08 Tired of hearing about his nasdaq stocks for an hour then looking at a word document of definitions
899 2018-02-14 19:31:43 Digital assets aren’t stocks lol. Find a new gig big guy.
900 2018-02-14 19:31:02 Stocks could be going higher. $XOP $XLE rally helping. #Bond exodus and #Inflation in the #USD will lead that cash into other assets. #FANGS not my asset of choice, but it's likely that money is going into stocks. Certain sectors to benefit #Commodities #Infrastructure
901 2018-02-14 19:30:48 He told people stocks were in big fat ugly bubble n w/i days of being elected he bragged about the bigger fatter uglier bubble. That alone is worthy of eternal contempt, inviting the world to crash and burn. He gushed over Obama in 2008. Hes pushed Universal Health Care for yrs.
902 2018-02-14 19:30:13 Stocks are doing great so love is definitely in the air for me 
903 2018-02-14 19:30:09 @jimcramer finally seeing a reverse, hope we can go down 1000 so we can buy some stocks on discount

905 2018-02-14 19:29:56 A lot of people are freaking: yields, dollar, stocks... This is typical late cycle behavior, which has been slightly extended with CB policy 

Have a plan. Have a contingency plan, and when it's time just execute. $SPX
906 2018-02-14 19:29:46 Stocks love it
907 2018-02-14 19:29:22 How far do you think this can go?
908 2018-02-14 19:28:45 A subs dream/nightmare come true!  I haven't been rammed in stocks before;)  One that I will add to my wishlist now...
909 2018-02-14 19:28:24 I think both Warren and Charlie have suggested at different times that to do so today, you would have to find an area a lot more inefficient than stocks - even thinly traded ones
910 2018-02-14 19:27:19 Can u get over Bhutto and talk about urself. What have u done? Sindh is today in a worst condition than any other province. Educational reforms are dead. Hospitals are used to keep live stocks. Interior Sindh is still in Stone Age. Sukkhar, Hyderabad being prime cities r doomed.
911 2018-02-14 19:27:10 We just always importing from them making a even playing field Yes stocks are up they can siip on day and back up next day. Been way better Obama ever did. Trump isn’t even taking a salary.

913 2018-02-14 19:25:14 @PowerLunch I am from india, the bond yields globally going up, I think this is because of commodity prices rising, dont you think one should buy commodity stocks to beat this inflation
914 2018-02-14 19:24:59 I want to invest in Cannabis stocks - can someone help me?
915 2018-02-14 19:24:54 He needs to keep dollar cost averaging into a diversified portfolio and focus on his career. He has the right attitude. He will lose half his money in a market crash, but will be able to buy discounted stocks when that happens. Kudos
916 2018-02-14 19:23:36 I’d hate to follow you for advice on stocks  feel bad for your 29 followers
917 2018-02-14 19:23:21 @ReutersMoney with the stock market so crazy right now are  stocks (health device / pharma) a good long term investment?
918 2018-02-14 19:23:04 Stocks been going up lately
919 2018-02-14 19:22:13 What's the point in restocking the river if you can't fish for the stocks?
920 2018-02-14 19:21:21 Well certain central banks have put “we buy stocks” signs up also
921 2018-02-14 19:20:29 @cryptoallstarz Highlights the difference in buying art verses buying stocks. The price of art rarely goes down.
922 2018-02-14 19:19:23 So I guess that $ZB $TLT going down is good for stocks $ES $NQ $RTY I won't be surprised if today's gains are given back
923 2018-02-14 19:19:14 US 10Y yields at 2.90 and the #SPX doesn't care. I guess buy the dip in stocks till 3.00 reached?
924 2018-02-14 19:15:17 you could see buying for days as most stocks are still under there prices before the first 5 % of the correction
925 2018-02-14 19:15:12 Can anyone make sense of today's action in stocks? 3.0% is the new 2.85%?
926 2018-02-14 19:15:07 Who's getting more money? Major corporations? All that money invested back in stocks are doing wonders for the poor among us. More jobs? Every other day I'm hearing of Toys R Us, Kimberly-Clark, Carrier laying off people. And Charlottesville never happened right?
927 2018-02-14 19:14:32 mam, I am from india, the bond yields globally going up, I think this is because of commodity prices rising, dont you think one should but commodity stocks to beat this inflation

931 2018-02-14 19:12:23 these markets are insane today. Nothing is trading in sync (USD vs Tsys vs stocks all seem to be doing their own thing). Great for us, tbh!! Plus gives traders a few more options, I guess. But choppy as hell!
932 2018-02-14 19:12:11 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
933 2018-02-14 19:12:05 How do you scan for waterfall stocks on finviz?
934 2018-02-14 19:11:23 My portfolio of volatile stocks has an equal 12-month return to the S&P index. Clearly I learned nothing in econ/finance class about passive investment.
935 2018-02-14 19:10:55 Berkshire Hathaway stocks affordability, like its loose change, is the goal.
936 2018-02-14 19:10:32 Btw, 'Universo Carmin' on Rua da Conceicao stocks great wines and you can sit and drink them in the shop until midnight or so. Before the night begins.....(Nothing happening before 1am). Very civilised, a sit in offy.
937 2018-02-14 19:10:13 The problem i have with stocks like his is being long know i'll regret taking profits so early $sybx   long baby
938 2018-02-14 19:09:20 Dans notre monde bourré de « vrai , humain, sensible » à base de photos de stocks. Je me dis que je regarderais beaucoup plus de documentaires à la TV si ceux ci n’étaient pas faussés par l’ajout de musique et de fausses mises en scènes qui petent tout notre imaginaire
939 2018-02-14 19:08:52 No.  Sorry.  Not yet.  Sold all my #Cannabis holdings and most everything else a few weeks ago.  #LuckyFucker  About to travel, and new condo made me #Crystallize most everything.  I do expect another big surge on #Cannabis stocks prior to July/2018 Canadian legalization.
940 2018-02-14 19:08:10 What a curious day. CPI surprises to upside (a bit); retail sales surprise to downside (a lot). 10 yr rises to 2.9% but dollar sinks; both stocks and gold rally (the latter taking its lead from $ as it pushes above $1350). My head hurts.
941 2018-02-14 19:07:07 @bamabroker must be getting trolled mercilessly today.  Gold, miners, crypto's and market, all up huge.  Natural Gas punk.  Did I miss a call?  He made a bet that Fed would sink stocks vs. bond market.  Trump, Nope.
942 2018-02-14 19:06:39 I doubt those stocks would be listed on fno

944 2018-02-14 19:05:38 stocks runs up, oil runs up, energy sector runs up, stocks run up, oil runs up more on stocks....
945 2018-02-14 19:05:13 Today was bloodbath in bank stocks. Tomm possibly export linked Auto stocks.#Trump to levy duties on Indian Auto imports.Germany too. Eicher, Motherson, Bharat Forge in trouble.
946 2018-02-14 19:04:37 Charlie Munger says it's time for regulators to 'let up' on Wells Fargo. Considering how much Berkshire Hathaway $BRKA $BRKB is invested in $WFC, I can see how 2 million fraud accounts opened without customers permission isn't that big of a deal. WOW #Banks #Investing #Stocks
947 2018-02-14 19:04:10 I remember when #inflation was bad for stocks. 

But that was so 12 days ago. #ES_F
948 2018-02-14 19:04:03 CAMT also looks identical (almost). Nice cheap stocks
949 2018-02-14 19:03:47 Ironically after Trump took credit for the long rise of the stock market, its recent crashes really do have to do with him and his reckless fiscal policy. 
"Stocks take a hit as inflation data fans rate hike fears, Dow down 130 points or 0.5 percent at market open"
950 2018-02-14 19:03:42 I will let you know when my inner body has defrosted. And l have got some sleep. Make sure Mellors stocks your wood pile up. It may get nasty your way towards the end of the month
951 2018-02-14 19:03:42 oil has certainly helped stocks
952 2018-02-14 19:02:47 Nice outfit especially those pretzels stocks

955 2018-02-14 19:02:24 Good news for my daughter @biance_stocks today, she was cleared to return to practice after her concussion last week. Following protocols and will see how body responds to practice next few days and make decisions about playing next week.
956 2018-02-14 19:01:30 Personally I dont see catch and release having any benefits.  If salmon stocks are low close the river.

958 2018-02-14 19:01:11 The weekly EIA inventory report showed US ethanol stocks fell 604,000 barrels to 22.885 million barrels while production fell 41,000 bpd to 1.016

959 2018-02-14 19:00:26 Is that all You have?? Have u seen all the jobs our Wonderful President has brought back ? Obama thought He would have magic wand!! Did You see our economy? What about stocks? Our Military is stronger! We Love  our President!!
960 2018-02-14 18:59:54 The EIA reported U.S. commercial crude oil stocks rose 1.841 million barrels while Cushing stocks dropped 3.642 million barrels.
961 2018-02-14 18:59:44 $SPY  For me it's not about finding just any stock that might go up but narrowing my focus on what stocks I expect to perform best.  $STUDY
962 2018-02-14 18:59:30 Looks like stocks are up today 
963 2018-02-14 18:59:10 sorry don't trust ADAG stocks...no view..
964 2018-02-14 18:59:01 Mid-day: Stocks continue to heat up with DOW 174 and NASDAQ up 105.  MBS down 47bps (Lenders pricing for worse/rates rise) and Yields rise to 2.91% (beating Monday's high of 2.90%).

966 2018-02-14 18:58:08 of course: sell bonds and that money goes into stocks

969 2018-02-14 18:56:39 Hey! Question: Is there a website where I can see what stocks have ssr on? My platform doesn't seem to provide this info.
970 2018-02-14 18:56:13 mmmmm.... Steel stocks $STLD $X (rip) $ATI (ready to rip). $AKS
971 2018-02-14 18:56:03 How about the short bonds short stocks trade?
972 2018-02-14 18:55:29 That's not really the same thing. I think underfished stocks are more analogous to voters who didn't vote (32% in 2016). That's where you have room to expand your resource base. Moving a stock from being overfished to fully fished would be switching parties
973 2018-02-14 18:54:48 stocks, bitcoin, gold, yields all rising, what could go wrong.......
974 2018-02-14 18:54:39 So Jim, rates are up, stocks are up, gold is up. What’s that say about the dollar?

979 2018-02-14 18:51:07 That was my guess too-there is a real (if remote) chance of war on Korean Peninsula and Syria mess is going strong into another year. Having replenished stocks in this environment is smart
980 2018-02-14 18:50:47 Rates, gold, and stocks are all up. What does that mean for the dollar?
981 2018-02-14 18:50:23 Let's see: #inflation ⇧, #stocks ⇧, #yields ⇧, fed fund expectations ⇧, #GOLD ⇧, #Commodities ⇧. Aren't stocks suppose to be down on a more aggressive Fed / isn't the "inflation narrative" suppose to be bad for stocks?

Thanks, dude.
988 2018-02-14 18:48:02 @SenSanders Just counting the NYSE and NASDAQ a 1% financial transaction tax would raise over $300B a year to support many of your socially desirable programs.  And it would be paid for by the 20% who trade stocks. Add in the off exchange transactions and the number goes way up.
989 2018-02-14 18:47:01 Mutual funds offer some of the great returns of the #StockMarket but  with a little less risk. These #mutualfunds bundle  stocks, bonds, and other #investments into a more balanced fund. Are you a mutual fund maven? Or a sassy stock market lady? Or both? #money
990 2018-02-14 18:46:58 2 stocks you should load up on for 2018 - FRLF and ANDI. Both should be huge runners!
991 2018-02-14 18:46:34 Is it a coincidence that as the 'collusion' narrative inverts, many Russian stocks are coming to life after going nowhere for the last year?
992 2018-02-14 18:46:20 There is only a couple of #lithium companies getting ready to run, $lac & $fat are two of them. Charts forming. Not much more you can ask for when comparing the sector. Anyone saying different isn't following the sector, nor do they understand how stocks run. Not a worry!
993 2018-02-14 18:45:08 Trump just finished off selling public lands.

998 2018-02-14 18:42:59 This was just a CNN Money article (not my thoughts), but I think the writer was thinking along the same lines as you - don't change too much, but make sure your allocations between stocks/bonds are where you want them to be.
999 2018-02-14 18:42:57 Outstanding move in $LMT today. I remain long. #219 rank out of 5,544 in the Best Stocks Now App.

1001 2018-02-14 18:41:41 Ok gotcha. I just find it hard to see lower vol and higher stocks with slowing global PMIs and rising inflation/rates. Especially given positioning. I could imagine higher equities with more vol.
1002 2018-02-14 18:41:31 wake up check your bank account, check your stocks then check your credit.
1003 2018-02-14 18:41:25 Lo de la resolución 125 fue un montaje de los mafiosos que rodean a kretina para que las Dreyfus y los Cargiles vendan sus stocks a 700 dolares la tonelada y después vender la nuestra (a 600)...

1007 2018-02-14 18:39:01 the bond selloff that has rates rising is non sense....hedge funds blew up...stocks go up with gentle inflation and gentle rising interest rates...there is tons of data that proves this.companies are in buying back stock agressively like every qrter
1008 2018-02-14 18:38:58 Agreed. Symbiotic support levels in both Stocks and Bonds. Can't see the Fed allowing them to be crossed more than temporarily.

1012 2018-02-14 18:38:31 Let's see: #inflation ⇧, #stocks ⇧, #yields ⇧, fed fund expectations ⇧, #GOLD ⇧, #Commodities ⇧. Aren't stocks suppose to be down on a more aggressive Fed / isn't the "inflation narrative" suppose to be bad for stocks?
1013 2018-02-14 18:37:33 Hahaha yun nga dapat eh! Bigla bigla nalang kasi nawawala mga stocks ko dto 
1014 2018-02-14 18:37:19 very large number of population fail to understand Valentine Day is nothing more than a very smart classic sales mktg policy initiated by western countries to sell off the Christmas surplus and not a socio cultural event, we also have our so called OFF Season Sale to clear stocks

1016 2018-02-14 18:35:48 FTD watch: Whether or not the Nasdaq's volume reaches Tuesday's level by the end of the day (this is likely, as the day's rally feeds on itself), the leading glamours have already spoken #stocks
1017 2018-02-14 18:35:45 What's different today with stocks and bonds? Stocks aren't going down as soon as yields levitate, because the $ is dropping like a rock.

1021 2018-02-14 18:35:03 Huge tell imo that we got the beat on inflation but stocks didn't care at all and retraced the entire down move.

1029 2018-02-14 18:32:06 EU helps conserve fish stocks; we lose far more trade than we can gain by leaving EU; we help poorer countries now; we need nurses, doctors, professors etc from abroad, also to pay our taxes; many Brits living in EU; we elect our own gov now; EU contribs are tiny, benefits huge!
1030 2018-02-14 18:31:39 A huge advance in sustainability: approval of genetically engineered omega-3 canola, which "could relieve pressure on wild fish stocks which are used as a source of omega-3."  The anti-genetic engineering activists will hate it, of course.  Save the Whales, anyone?
1031 2018-02-14 18:31:34 RGR - guessing that original cost basis would be roughly $1.50 share?  Something like that - which means the original shares would be yielding north of 200%

1043 2018-02-14 18:26:51 The VIX is designed to track investor anxiety and tends to move in the opposite direction of the benchmark S&P 500 index. Investors purchase VIX futures and options to protect against declines in stocks.

1049 2018-02-14 18:24:08 PNB stocks sure to fall tomorrow. #iPredict
1050 2018-02-14 18:23:41 Read so many research being critical towards CBs (rightly so in my opinion) bc of money printing/inflation/hyperinflation
But same time they bet on crash on equities which is NOT logic as inflation lifts stocks in the beginning, at least nominally
1051 2018-02-14 18:23:30 The little bouce we just saw in last couple of days is not really strong. Volume is very low as i look into the charts. It does not mean that the indices will go down, it just means that the bounce is not that strong in my opinion! #stocks #trading #investing #investors
1052 2018-02-14 18:23:04 Nothing's insane. Stocks started the day down 7% in less than three weeks. Financials leading as bond yields rise. This is how the tape acts after a volatility shock.
1053 2018-02-14 18:23:04 New high list remains small as most stocks still in the hole from late January.  Just 12 so far today in the S&P 500.

1057 2018-02-14 18:20:17 But stocks are up since the news came out. I keep waiting for the bottom to fall out and it just doesn't.

1061 2018-02-14 18:18:26 Old rule, before 2008: Sell stocks when the interest rates rise. 
New rule, after 2008: Buy stocks. Doesn't matter what happens.

1065 2018-02-14 18:16:06 remember when 2.80% in 10yr triggered the big selloff, i guess 2.90% is the sweetspot for stocks and every currency that isn't the USD.
1066 2018-02-14 18:15:50 The experience before seems to be that the Booming Economy that goes alongside Raising Rates seems to Trump the Hikes when it comes to Stocks. Bad for Bonds though.
1067 2018-02-14 18:15:30 Stay long TMV from the 18 dollar range, if you bought in-last at 21.77 as Bonds drop on technicals and fundamentals. And as the dow and economy becomes overheated, there is a need to raise rates. #ETF #Stocks #Commodities #Invest #Bonds

1123 2018-02-14 17:53:54 With stocks there are very specific rules about these investments are marketed. You cannot get through any OM's without a clear statement that Past Returns ≠ Future Returns yet every real estate agent out there is telling people that real estate always goes up. It's not true.

1132 2018-02-14 17:49:46 Housing is not an investment it is shelter and it is different from stocks in that it's primary purpose is for you to live in it. Income properties are different but misleading buyers into the biggest financial decision of their lives because it's an "investment" is wrong.
1133 2018-02-14 17:49:46 In that instance, would stocks go up or down?
1134 2018-02-14 17:49:28 U.S stocks up after inflation data
1135 2018-02-14 17:49:26 Also, cashing in stocks was the beginning of the great depression. If all who have stocks do that, welcome to 1929 revisited!

1146 2018-02-14 17:45:34 So far US markets buyont, may support u. To them nothing matters, rising yields or rising inflation. VIX slammed down so not ruling out one more round of selling in stocks looking at complacency but may happen in March.
1147 2018-02-14 17:45:20 There’s crypto currency and then stocks. I manly do stocks. But you should learn!

1149 2018-02-14 17:43:02 @NoorAlAli 
Hi Noor, have you had a chance to look at Weiss Ratings, their new CC ratings? Just came out two weeks ago, they are independent impartial rating services, rate over 55,000 fin stocks, bonds, companies. Happy to arrange interview with founder.
1150 2018-02-14 17:42:37 Presumably they already have stocks or supply contracts that need to be used up first. 2020 isn't that far away.
1151 2018-02-14 17:42:10 That's why I will not set foot in a Walgreens just as I have not set foot in Target let's watch their stocks crumble
1152 2018-02-14 17:41:31 This guy on CNBC telling me which stocks to buy is bald on top and has a ponytail. Needless to say I don’t trust his judgement.
1153 2018-02-14 17:41:30 "But 2 stocks artificially buffs ZSS and Pokémon Trainer, while artificially nerfing Lucario and Wario".
We could've had something great....

1156 2018-02-14 17:40:00 I don’t normally tweet about stocks but that’s where I started in this game. $wb and $nvda are some of my favorites. Get on those I promise you despite the price. Found wb at like 20 dollars and had nvda since 69 dollars in 11/16. That’s all #invest #nvda #wb #weibo #stocks
1157 2018-02-14 17:39:47 Well there could be an infinite number of companies/stocks/bonds as well.

1159 2018-02-14 17:39:13 @Papa_Stocks you alerted us on this one!
1160 2018-02-14 17:38:58 the weight-of-the-evidence continues to suggest owning the stocks and ETFs where momentum did NOT hit oversold conditions last week. In other words, owning the ones where the 14-period RSI stayed above 30. There are a lot of them....
1161 2018-02-14 17:38:49 Wow, everybody is into stocks. I need to learn
1162 2018-02-14 17:38:30 @wetnwildIreland please help me! Where can I find a store that stocks your products in Dublin City centre? Tried Dunnes Stores & Penney’s, can’t find you!  currently visiting from England, only here til Friday! X

1165 2018-02-14 17:35:54 Stocks?
1166 2018-02-14 17:35:47 Yes it does. $NVDA was the catalyst that got me into trading stocks seriously. I made so much money just holding onto it for a year and a half that I was able to fund a trading account with the proceeds. This thing has been coiling since earnings. It's definitely a conviction buy
1167 2018-02-14 17:35:46 Thanks Vlad i see it now and yea i think litecoin has a more brighter future its founder @SatoshiLite is really putting in work and 1 of the best guys in the crypto sphere

1180 2018-02-14 17:30:18 Just read an article that SETI cannot get ahold of their needed GPU's because cryptocurrency miners are hoarding them out of stocks? I never thought GPU's get out of stock around the whole world!

1187 2018-02-14 17:26:58 Dunno if I should recommend buying from Amazon Japan. The stocks in my local store all came from the US (or at least that's how it looks like anyway)

1190 2018-02-14 17:25:58 Do you live in your stocks? Is the purpose of your stocks to generate money? Is there an expectation of cash flow and profit at the stated business ie rent? Does your stock have nice granite countertops? Is your wife proud of your stocks and clean it all the time? K then.

1192 2018-02-14 17:25:34 Y’all worry about Valentine’s Day, I’m over here worried about my stocks going up !
1193 2018-02-14 17:24:54 I’m not talking about stocks!!! My tweet was about putting money into cryptos. Of course there are high risk stocks for the risk loving individual but I CAN GURANTEE THE NORMAL INVESTOR IS DOING CONSERVATIVE RISK , STABLE DIVIDEND INCOME STOCKS. Which they know will grow
1194 2018-02-14 17:24:26 Bought some weed stocks aswell
1195 2018-02-14 17:24:15 This is from December and they are expecting the economy to weaken again...along with stocks
1196 2018-02-14 17:24:08 Its also crazy to think how many people are sitting around trading crypto, stocks, etc, just seems like a waste of time and they should be doing something to help the world or actually working.  A greedy job if there ever was one =X

1198 2018-02-14 17:22:56 U.S. debt prices fell on Wednesday after a spike in U.S. consumer prices in January raised expectations the Federal Reserve may quicken the pace of interest rate hikes, while global stocks rose as investors took a longer view of inflation.
1199 2018-02-14 17:22:47 Many people have stocks in their retirement portfolio & when the stock prices are high (like today) it is a great time to cash in those stocks to reinvest elsewhere. Why do you see Capitalism as a problem? Capitalism has built the greatest nation on the face of the earth!
1200 2018-02-14 17:22:35 Awesome price. I was thinking the same buy typically these binary reactions tales 3 to 5 days of selling to bounce.
1201 2018-02-14 17:22:35 $TYHT ready to go for that ma 200 area imo...watching it closely over 2.4s area for confirmation
1202 2018-02-14 17:22:15 So you accept that the UK gov gave the licenses to major international companies.  Leaving the EU won’t stop that so what will change? Unless you’re suggesting over fishing until stocks run out because they can’t reproduce which is what quotas addressed.
1203 2018-02-14 17:22:08 Jim, I'm not sure everyone is saying "buy the dip". Everyone (mostly) has their 401k AUTOMATICALLY sending money to their 401k investment mgrs who just throw it into the market lifting stocks. Theyre complaining so I think theyre really saying, "I HOPE WE GO BACK UP"

1207 2018-02-14 17:21:11 @Papa_Stocks what’s the story with $thds?
1208 2018-02-14 17:20:48 I’m not talking about high risk stocks. If u read my tweet, I’m saying by putting money into cryptos u are speculating. And there is a huge difference between speculating and investing. That’s all I’m saying
1209 2018-02-14 17:19:55 completely different fundamental picture.  Tech stocks weren't nearly as overvalued in the 80s.  And the end period that you are analyzing is the peak of the dot com bubble.  It would be highly optimistic to assume that tech will EVER get to those valuations again
1210 2018-02-14 17:19:54 I am in  what news on this one
1211 2018-02-14 17:18:59 Had to process a bit.  Think its fairly simple,  trade from here:  Weak dollar and ultimately and absolute flood into inflationary stocks and commodities.

1224 2018-02-14 17:14:12 The reason corporations buy back stocks:
1. Fewer stocks increases the value of remaining stocks.
2. Higher stock values goose the EPS (earnings per share) value.
3. By returning a higher EPS, executives qualify for bonuses.
Profits that should be dividends are spent on execs.

1238 2018-02-14 17:08:13 The Wall Street speculators pay no tax on their share of a yearly turnover of over $5 quadrillion (5,000 trillion dollars) in stocks, bonds and derivatives. A 1% tax on this turnover, equally divided between the federal and state governments, largely solves the budget deficit.

1251 2018-02-14 17:03:25 Don't forget that the stock market is a #market of #stocks. But never forget that the most stocks rise and fall together. If you put on too many positions in a short time, you have a high risk. Especially in such volatile situations as we currently see.

1282 2018-02-14 16:50:33 Professionals who have been around a few cycles know that now is the time to sell stocks & buy high quality bonds- sadly, few will do it, preferring to "let it ride" in stocks and leaving clients unprepared for the next bear market.
1283 2018-02-14 16:49:48 ..and higher stocks. ;)
1284 2018-02-14 16:49:23 Richer than Warren Buffett? 

The instructions for the trustee of his estate are:
90% stocks (S&P 500 index fund) &

1285 2018-02-14 16:49:04 4)Appeals for warm clothings be made,inclusive of weather protection ones. 

Centralized areas for hot food distribution. Medical stocks be prepped up to deal w/common cold/flu/cough, Emergency strong shelters,etc - such r WITHIN  LOCAL & INTERNATIONAL abilities, to save lives.
1286 2018-02-14 16:48:41 That's the Unpredictable Swamp Stock Market is.. I also feel elated n sombre. Movement of stocks up or down moves me correspondingly
1287 2018-02-14 16:48:28 That was the tricky part. Took us about 6 weeks to source everything because of out of stocks.
1288 2018-02-14 16:48:25 They’re sort of like stocks, but they’re a different concept. Buy small first and play with it. Get the app Coinbase to get bit, ether and lite coin. It’s the easiest and safest
1289 2018-02-14 16:47:38 Is that a reverend I spy there? I've wanted to play one but nobody stocks them anywhere near me.
1290 2018-02-14 16:47:18 rates will turn stocks NOW
1291 2018-02-14 16:47:13 Can somebody please tell me when the GNC selling will stop. Even JPM Chase with a neutral rating and a $6 price target says GNC has a 35% upside. Stocks with a big short interest, big upside PT and good China News go up bigWTF
1292 2018-02-14 16:47:01 10 year yields ... 2.9%

BAM! BUY STOCKS! (corporations are)
1293 2018-02-14 16:46:50 My unprofessional assessment is nothing has really changed. Maybe more digging for stocks that have more upside potential, given the run $HD has had, coupled with the I don't think the company is in buying back shares right now.
1294 2018-02-14 16:46:40 at some point stocks will notice where rates are...
1295 2018-02-14 16:46:30 I removed PC Jeweller from my watch..these kind of stocks are known for giving these kind of moves.
1296 2018-02-14 16:45:53 $GSK When we look at stocks specifically, a couple of names that boil to the top that look specifically undervalued, Roche and GlaxoSmithKline are two names we are highlighting. Both have strong pipelines, and both are well-positioned to grow through patent losses
1297 2018-02-14 16:45:52 I always find it funny when I scroll through #CashTags of stocks and people entering short positions none other than bc “ticker shouldn’t be here”

#NewsFlash most tickers don’t belong where they are. Only a matter of time before you blow an account up trading with that mindset

1307 2018-02-14 16:42:53 So are we far enough away that we can start talking about bump-stocks and whether we want someone to be able to snipe a thousand people from a half-mile away in about 10 minutes?

1315 2018-02-14 16:40:43 Alright to get this straight: 
1. fear of higher inflation and higher rates led to a correction in stocks (so down)
2. Today’s number mean higher inflation and rates. 
Markets’ Reaction?
Stocks are up like there are none left tomorrow... I’m more than a bit puzzled tbh....
1316 2018-02-14 16:39:08 How do you know it's still a bull market? When "chatroom" takeover chatter pushes stocks higher. ($BUFF.) Not sayin' there is never truth behind vague speculation ... just sayin'!

1333 2018-02-14 16:33:23 He said bonds are in a bubble, but he would not weigh in decisively on stocks. He sees the tension between the good effects of corporate tax cuts and the harsh effects of rising yields. Unclear which force wins out and when...

1338 2018-02-14 16:32:34 Oil prices rose on Wednesday, rebounding from earlier losses after U.S. crude stocks rose less than expected and Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said major oil producers would prefer tighter markets than to end supply cuts too early.

1344 2018-02-14 16:29:23 Need some economic lessons I guess. Today's market theory says upward pressure on rates is good for earnings/stocks?!? Please explain
1345 2018-02-14 16:29:09 My husband is actually getting less money as soon as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act went through. Getting $30 less per pay period. instead was offered the ability to buy stocks into the company. So the company gets more money and the worker does not.

1357 2018-02-14 16:25:55 Another thing about my investing during Reagan's Presidency: 
1984 was a bad year for stocks. But it did recover. Dollar cast averaging paid off big time in the end! 10 yr bond rates 01/84 11.6%% & 01/82 13.5%. Those are rates to worry about!

1371 2018-02-14 16:20:59 It's funny people want to give input when stocks are crashing. Where are you when money is doubling?

1374 2018-02-14 16:19:37 Nifty futures  open Interest stayed flat amidst volatility and weakness in Banking stocks. As longs are still holding their positions, Nifty(spot) can gain strength if moves above 10550. On the downside, weakness in Bank stocks can drag Nifty towards 10430-10390 levels.
1375 2018-02-14 16:19:13 #LIZJNY Important lesson learned on my GDX put trade, $GDX has opposite IV reaction than normal stocks.  $GDX up $GDXIV up.  As a result need more from $GDX to close than expected.
1376 2018-02-14 16:19:10 $shop wtf is wrong with people?  if you are buying into earnings at all time highs...i dont normally wish this upon people, but you deserve to lose your money....does anyone care about risk management anymore? were you not around las week?  stocks go down now! lol this aint 2017
1377 2018-02-14 16:18:36 Another one of many lessons @jimcramer has taught me over the last decade.  DO NOT USE MARGIN!!  It creates an unnecessary pressure on you to sell when you don’t want to what’s worse leave you with little flexibility when you have no ca$h and stocks go on sale.

1463 2018-02-14 15:46:33 One of the reasons stock took a rise was due to the purchases of Hair Gel Entities stocks.  Expectations of same is sure to drop when there is no hair left for multi-comb overs...

1466 2018-02-14 15:46:20 Crude stocks  – despite the rise, they fell to 18.5% below year ago levels and fell to a new cycle low of 2.6% over the five year average because normally we get a lot bigger build this week of the year.  #OOTT

1664 2018-02-14 14:58:57 A *huge* boost in social housing (basically doubling it with existing Housing Association / PRP stocks taken into account), cost neutral, nay, even profitable given that you could set rents lower but still higher than costs.

1668 2018-02-14 14:57:49 It is wayyyyy over-done, however, as your chart indicates.  The "worry" is too far out, to influence stocks, as it is.  However, there should be a better defensive play going on, in equities, with out-cycle of growth, in cycle to industrial, material, energy.  Not happening...

1671 2018-02-14 14:56:45 Investors can't figure out what they want.  Rising inflation means that the economy is doing well, the economy doing well means that companies make more money.

1754 2018-02-14 14:29:44 #StockMarket #stocks  What's emerging from today's data is a gradual pattern of inflation. Watch for the 10Yr Treasury note to start moving up and reaching just below 4% by Nov.  Republican are backing into the meat grinder and seem somewhat behind in their work.

1757 2018-02-14 14:29:21 In my humble opinion, the reason why stocks are falling is not because of the high GDP growth in the United States but instead, the expected action by the U.S. Federal Reserve.

If the Fed chooses to ignore the inflation, stocks will rise again.

1838 2018-02-14 13:56:57 TNX still below 2.9% which means this was just an excuse to sell stocks, not a solid "belief."
1839 2018-02-14 13:56:42 Okay brining this back... idiots shorted volitility and I fed volitility spiked they got margin called causing the single biggest drop in the market ever. Today we had CPI numbers released and they are 2.1% vs expected 1.9%. This points to higher interest rates and lower stocks
1840 2018-02-14 13:56:16 Spending dropped in Jan., #CPI rising, all against backdrop of ballooning consumer debt — not a good mix for stocks in a consumer-based economy.  Rates definitely rising... maybe faster this year than expected?  #cpi #stocks #consumer #economy

1846 2018-02-14 13:53:29 Any positive correlation between #BTC #bitcoin and equities will move toward an inverse correlation as stocks are extremely overvalued by historical measures and BTC (sound money) is extremely undervalued.
1847 2018-02-14 13:51:57 This morning's core CPI report is higher than consensus, so the market response: higher $USD, sell bonds, sell stocks, steeper yield curve... raising short-term rates is intended to keep inflation in check. Rising inflation puts pressure on the high P/E stock market.
1848 2018-02-14 13:51:40 Stock futures just dropped sharply across the board. As I explained a couple tweets ago, stocks do not like inflation right now due to prospect fast interest rate hikes. Monetary tightening is strongly correlated with recent recessions.
1849 2018-02-14 13:50:55 US consumer prices rose more than expected in January, possibly leading to a faster than expected rise in inflation. Historically, stocks and bonds have decreased in value and precious metals have done well during inflationary periods.
1850 2018-02-14 13:50:45 Inflation is soaring, time for a punt, stocks have sold off, but I’ve traded like a c***.

1852 2018-02-14 13:50:14 There you have it.  CPI came out and stocks AND bonds crashed. Looks like a day trading congestion play to me since March T-bonds were UP 15 as the news came out.  Everyone attempted to take their money off the table and bonds went negative by 15 in 6 minutes! A full handle down!
1853 2018-02-14 13:49:56 Is there any reason to be bullish in stocks anymore based on $CPI data?

1871 2018-02-14 13:43:47 A key reason we a couple of weeks ago turned negative on US stocks was that our Monetary Indicator for the US showed that the Fed would likely overshoot its 2% inflation target in the medium-term. Markets are now really focusing on these inflationary risks.

1970 2018-02-14 13:05:34 Yes agree. The bull market is set to continue at least until global earnings turn down and we are a long way from that barring a shock to global growth. Even if US inflation ticks up this week we are still some way from it impacting negatively on stocks.

2111 2018-02-14 11:30:08 I bet we are soon. You raise rates and bonds fall. If stocks correct, which invariably happens, at the same time, money has no where to hide and creates a negative feedback loop
2112 2018-02-14 11:29:17 To be honest I think either way where losing the NHS taxes in or out will rise when we leave after the initial panic stocks and shares will settle and I think nothing will change we will still trade with us we make up a lot of the market in sales cars,tech,etc

2138 2018-02-14 11:02:54 Yeah that's the vaguest of all. Seems like you could just make them put in a stocks and shares style warning and be done with it instead of all this fannying about
2139 2018-02-14 11:02:36 The economy and corporate earnings were nowhere near as robust in 2008; moreover, the banks are firmly solvent now whereas the mortgage default crisis was already beginning to unfold by February of 2008. 

Considering growth rates, stocks are fairly valued.
2140 2018-02-14 11:02:27 Nothing will happen in near four months. Just a major selling will be visible in end of march and a repurchase of stocks will be seen the next week. So all in all no market bad mood as of now ....yes crude is playing little spoil sport

2142 2018-02-14 10:59:00 Huge volumes dont mean price is increasing. Huge volume can mean a sell off as well. I seen many stocks and cryptos falling to new lows on huge volumes. Xrp price is not tied to usage. Its value is tied to speculator valuation. $5 max for next 5 years thereafter maybe $10

2173 2018-02-14 10:25:40 Eg. right now many stocks have dropped right, LT holders have losty profits and traders.....real traders are shorting making money on way down! then when it turns they will trade it long al way back up in and out.....with size i might add!
2174 2018-02-14 10:25:39 But when stocks enter their next bear market you could see a flight back to Treasuries pushin rates back down. But by that point this strong economic growth narrative would be quashed anyway.

2201 2018-02-14 10:02:39 Yes I agree. I trade long and short even during the easy bull market. But was 95% long I'm now about 60%-70% short..... but shorting weak stocks in this market as more 'upside' than holding longs on their own.

2206 2018-02-14 09:59:54 To investors stocks represent fractional ownership of underlying businesses ! It's neither a piece of paper nor demat Entry ! For me stocks = business!

2212 2018-02-14 09:55:39 A Peter Lynch quote to remember on Valentine's Day :

"In Stocks as in Romance, ease of divorce is not a sound basis for commitment" !!!


2213 2018-02-14 09:54:53 Probably, but with a greater awareness of the current situation...when the bull runs, opportunity is everywhere, I’ve found my trades to be in that situation more TA than FA, whereas LT stocks have a higher FA value.....probably a hybrid of trading styles, but profitable...
2214 2018-02-14 09:54:39 An interesting point: this article doesn't mention that the richest people didn't actually lose any money. Their stocks lost value. The only ones who lost money were people that sold their stocks at the lower price.
2215 2018-02-14 09:54:10 As my bro always says, " If can't trust a local jeweller while buying jewellery then you should not trust jewellery stocks too. After all they both are one and the same."
2216 2018-02-14 09:53:58 Non mais il n'y a même plus de game là... Soit tu connais quelqu'un avec accès direct aux stocks, soit t'es un bot !
2217 2018-02-14 09:53:40 I have avoided fresh buys in this relief rally courtesy to my Market Timing Model, still in bearish zone. A small minority of stocks may outperform in market dominated by bears but I would like to have a strong bullish wind to sail smoothly & increase my odds.

2412 2018-02-14 06:27:38 Non ce n'est pas un moyen d'essayer des armes. La Syrie utilise manifestement des armes chimiques contre son engagement à ne pas le faire. Frapper ces stocks d'armes peut sauver des milliers de civils. Je vois laisse faire le compte.

2422 2018-02-14 06:22:43 I am having a moment where I have nothing interesting to say. Twitter stocks tumble accordingly.

2433 2018-02-14 06:11:50 On vacation but thought I'd check up on Twitter once. Seeing a lot of idiots bashing stocks with an obvious agenda. You really think the bashing will change the market? Grow up or go back to stockhouse. Block these morons and clear the clutter.
2434 2018-02-14 06:11:11 The equivalent of the creator of Nike only wearing Reebok to avoid having his stocks going up too high to make his investors happy. Litecoin is a currency, but it's creator exchanged his for fait and can't #PayWithLitecoin. What a #Martyr

2442 2018-02-14 06:05:41 Why would whales sell a huge correction that tagged the 10month ema and 50 week ema? Look at historical bull asset corrections that hit those levels including tech stocks. Whales are long

2462 2018-02-14 05:43:11 i figure this more about what you want to own in the world an that were we knew it a be a hot asset or the people but someone want it way more then others the thing is you can buy stocks you can buy digital coin but can you buy the system i want to bring no it mine the real deal
2463 2018-02-14 05:39:26 Human nature evolves slowly. If we don't learn the lessons of the past we'll make similar mistakes. Nobody is saying Trump is presently advocating genocide, but it would be obtuse to simply dismiss similarities to prewar Germany. Especially with stocks beginning to sputter.

2479 2018-02-14 05:24:25 I tried to debate/ start a conversation about a stock with this troll @stocktraderalph his response was to block me and move on trolling. He bashes stocks before doing any DD and blocks anyone with opposing views. I dont even think he sleeps or trades he just trolls 24/7

Stocks sitting <200 dma have the market saying it doesn't believe their prospects are good.Check out past stocks to see if that exit would have helped.I wish I had always done this!
2482 2018-02-14 05:18:26 "Oil stocks" is a big category. It's a large E&P. It's direct competitors are Pioneer, Apache, Anadarko, EOG. They've all sold off.

2484 2018-02-14 05:16:38 ...so you now have two yrs of estimates to help guide your analysis. E.g. $AMZN is now showing 81% and 84% for 2018 and 2019, an unheard of growth rate for such a behemoth. Sure, these are "only" estimates and subject to change. But this is what the market trades off of. #stocks

2492 2018-02-14 05:08:07 Stop trying to predict the market! If keep jumping in and out from stocks because the market is going to crash, then you are bound to have lousy returns because you are going to keep missing the best trading days in the market. #StockMarket #StockMarketCrash #investing
2493 2018-02-14 05:08:05 Buy such quality stocks that during a severe market downturn, it's broad smile on your face rather than a panic reaction.
2494 2018-02-14 05:06:16 Agreed. Still long Gold $GC_F here... while I also do think Stocks will globally move higher, I think #Commodities will outperform Equities this year led by breakouts in #Metals like Gold. *And helped by a weaker U.S. Dollar...
2495 2018-02-14 05:03:32 I ageee but put options on all of these stocks are wildly expensive, as crowded of a long the trade is its very difficult to get good R/R on the short side. Fine with me to be sitting on the sidelines spectating...

2504 2018-02-14 04:55:20 Don’t trust fund managers with their judgment & integrity. Buying PSU stocks is criminal
2505 2018-02-14 04:55:04 Please stop saying he’s a successful businessman. He inherited money from Dad & then launched one unsuccessful business after another. Unpaid workers, bankrupt companies, money laundering? and fraudulent practices. He’d be wealthier if he just invested his Daddy $$ in stocks.
2506 2018-02-14 04:54:41 It's heartening to see many "numbers and chart setup backed" stocks trade at pre 11111 levels. You can't keep quality down for too long.

2514 2018-02-14 04:46:17 I am fully agree with you ,But in stock market money is transfer from one pocket (retailer)to another pocket (HNI)
So be aware about fancy stocks because when we know about HNI holding stocks already run away

2531 2018-02-14 04:31:34 It takes bigger money managers 2-8 weeks to rotate positions- but that doesn’t necessarily mean the indices will go down. People will buy back into the index ETFs. Individual stocks will show increased volatility to what everyone has been used to.

Too much polarization, it seems as if it’s a NHL championship going on. I am sure, there are saner elements discussing stocks, however more visible ones are quite different from what I expected initially when I started following handles on Twitter.

2563 2018-02-14 03:58:48 Well, that’s of course not a 280 char answer and there is no secret sauce anyway. But for example when market/sector gets jittery I tend to look at options in low beta stocks. A lot of this is gut feeling tbh.

2664 2018-02-14 02:51:24 Pretty much, except with stocks you own a share of ownership in a company. With bitcoin, a piece of code that is essentially worthless and is far more speculative than NEARLY any stock. As long as a company is getting results, it’s worth something. Bitcoin, just speculation.

2670 2018-02-14 02:47:56 So there are only certain stocks you can trade 24hr, I don't think this is a good idea, its like they are trying to replicate crypto, and the main holder could manipulate that stock I feel....I like at the same time, but how much thought & research has TD done

2782 2018-02-14 01:32:19 Food bank I volunteer at gives it out when someone buys it for us. I’ve never tried it. People who’ve had it don’t usually refuse it. Dollar Tree stocks the Gossner brand for $1 a quart box and I guess I need to buy and try it to see it it’s really that bad.
2783 2018-02-14 01:31:26 I don't really understand this point. Nobody keeps significant amounts in US dollars. You use dollars in excess of what's needed for short-term expenses in gold, stocks, bonds, or bitcoin. Gold doesn't compete against dollars, it competes against these investments.

2786 2018-02-14 01:28:35 Your first and third sentence are lies. Your second is simply ignorant. Shareholders are us, doofus. You, you are a shareholder if you have any brains whatsoever. See my question above: who owns the stocks? Us: me and (maybe) you.
2787 2018-02-14 01:28:22 My problem is stocks keep on going up and I no longer have positions in the red since I haven't bought anything in taxable brokerage acct in a few years.

2789 2018-02-14 01:25:49 I've been thinking about that! I don't know if our SLI stocks that particular stain. India ink is something else I have come across for capsule stains too!
2790 2018-02-14 01:24:57 Do you have statistical data to show that crypto's follow text book style elliot waves as per the rules used in stocks? We shouldn't use 'feel' in technical analysis, we should collect data and calculate probabilities of making certain pathway moves.

2826 2018-02-14 00:56:47 Its why I watch those stocks that get tapped on my watch list to see if a catalyst comes so still in it riding.

2828 2018-02-14 00:55:15 I typically buy around 200 SMA for sleepy stocks and for high vol stocks I draw supply and demand zones that I learned from a friend who took training courses from Online Trading Academy.  I’m an amateur with managing emotions.  Even if I master the mechanics I’ll lose.

2831 2018-02-14 00:53:18 If the yield on the 10-year [Treasury] keeps moving appreciably higher next week, it's going to trigger another round of selling in stocks, which is why you need to watch the 10-year like a hawk.
2832 2018-02-14 00:51:39 Lol that would be great if it does. But if it goes lower then 2.30 that's a steal.
2833 2018-02-14 00:50:58 Someone needs to teach me stocks so I can invest since @Mocurrie25 only gave me the 30 second intro

2835 2018-02-14 00:47:50 Doesn't matter. This is a central bank supported stock. Notice certain stocks go up regardless?
2836 2018-02-14 00:46:41 No reason #Crude #Oil $CL_F should be ~$59... #Oil doesn't need to recover overnight... but it certainly fell a bit too fast on liquidity move while the stock market was margin calling everyone... If stocks can find a reason to recover, there are many more reasons #Oil will too.

2845 2018-02-14 00:41:19 @UtProsim540 So do you think new money forsakes stocks (in the midst of sound earnings & economic expansion) to chase after rising rates?
2846 2018-02-14 00:41:17 Very inspiring! I’ve had a rough couple weeks, and it’s nice to hear that things can get better. Just for the record, u spent time several late nights explaining things to me in the discord chat when I was only a few months into otc stocks.
2847 2018-02-14 00:40:27 My guess it will be down , lower. Intel can't go to $50 anymore until next earnings or any news coming up. That's it for them.scraps stocks.
2848 2018-02-14 00:39:58 IMHO since so much QE money ended up in the stock market what should have happened to the price of bread happened to the price of stocks.  As such there is a huge discrepancy b/w the firms value on paper and its potential total profit.
2849 2018-02-14 00:39:50 Until cryptocurrency values stabilize they will never become legitimate payment options. Everyone will be afraid to pay with them because the value will go up later. They are basically just stocks in blockchain tech companies at this point
2850 2018-02-14 00:39:46 So this lying sack of sh*t is cutting benefits on the elderly to make money on defense stocks, even though they contributed from every pay check!! The RepubliKlans want to forget that we pay for SSI & Medicare, while they steal from it annually to pay for tax cuts!! Really??
2851 2018-02-14 00:39:45 u guys talking about bio deals since clinton era lol. stocks will go higher with broader market this year and funds could flow into biotech with rising rates.
2852 2018-02-14 00:39:00 Eventhough some of the stocks are pushing higher, I prefer not to anticipate due to overall bearish sentiment of the #Market
2853 2018-02-14 00:38:16 I have been deep in thought. Deeeeeeep deeep deep deep deep ... and I have come to the conclusion that #beetrooter needs to stay, cos if he is replace by #Chester, well shit, the govt stocks could improve, and hey, that ain't no good! #LNPfail #auspol #beetrootgate #rootgate
2854 2018-02-14 00:38:12 By itself #Bitcoin could of course fall <$3k, <$2k, etc. Always possible though becomes less likely to see it through a long & choppy horizon.

One big difference with tech bubble proxy is at time there were no other competing bubbles to attract traders (like we now have Stocks!)
2855 2018-02-14 00:36:00 Every stock that saw it's Relative Strength line make a new high today within the entire database in @MarketSmith of 7k+ stocks .  It's a screen I run. I have another with tighter fundamental metrics, but that one I posted is the raw and uncut list.
2856 2018-02-14 00:35:28 $BPMC and $FGEN my favorite stocks by far. Think $AMAG has a much better 2018. Some more cheap stocks to watch $RCKT, $SYBX and $CBAY

2860 2018-02-14 00:28:22 #Yen was strong... but $JPY been selling off since 10am... & now trading red... I think Asia stocks should be outperforming U.S. Stocks... Very surprised to see recent #Nikkei 225 $NKD_F weakness been more aggressive vs. U.S... I would expect Japanese stocks to close that gap...
2861 2018-02-14 00:27:52 Update late after the close, stocks slightly up, volatility continuing to drop sideways starting to entrench. TREND STILL DOWN, FULL HEDGES, but I noticed that I had to adjust the hedge size down a bit as vol quieted. Enjoy the ride!
2862 2018-02-14 00:27:12 I seriously think Bonds and stocks will go totally vertical tomorrow. CB's will blow out shorts in both.  Up limit.
2863 2018-02-14 00:26:58 You then proceed to walk outside and greet your bro who's in the stocks
2864 2018-02-14 00:25:41 Well, do you think CB's want your Inflationary stocks, or mine, to go up?  It's obvious they surpress assets, too.
2865 2018-02-14 00:24:14 Question. Are your value stocks natural resource?

2868 2018-02-14 00:23:10 The nra has been controlling the ATF nra passed legislation for years. That’s why the ATF can’t computerize gun records, the CDC can’t study gun deaths, bump stocks can’t be banned, concealed carry reciprocity will be law, & armor piercing ammunition will become legal.
2869 2018-02-14 00:23:03 #Nikkei 225 $NKD_F was down 400+ points today... at one point down 600+ points...?! *What a joke considering U.S. Stocks were able to turn positive today! All the risk came from VIX manipulation in U.S. in the first place... No relation to Japanese Stocks, ST extremely oversold!!
2870 2018-02-14 00:22:49 @CharlesSchwab:
"The peak-to-trough drawdown in global stocks so far this year, at about 8%, is only about half of the average annual pullback of the past 37 yrs. That could mean there is more to come, either for the current pullback or additional pullbacks over the course of yr"
2871 2018-02-14 00:22:12 They should have stocks for twitter accounts
2872 2018-02-14 00:22:10 @CharlesSchwab:
"Global stocks have fallen from peak-to-trough by more than 10% in two-thirds of the years since 1979; yet most of those times still posted a gain for the year, as you can see in the chart below."
2873 2018-02-14 00:20:00 Wht stocks?
2874 2018-02-14 00:19:19 Should have clarified I was being sarcastic when I said "gem." I personally wouldn't touch penny stocks with a 10-foot pole -- that's more speculating, not investing. I'm content waiting on sidelines until I find what I consider a sustainable business model in the cannabis space.
2875 2018-02-14 00:16:28 Awesome u an Penny Machine we are the triads woes.
2876 2018-02-14 00:14:46 You have time deposits, money markets, stocks and bonds to avoid that 2-3%. The 2-3% was chosen by economists for a reason. It's a small price to pay to promote growth, avoid liquidity traps and avoid deflation.
2877 2018-02-14 00:14:42 No era pa meter miedo, si tú no necesitabas el dinero es buena, en cierta manera como jugar con los stocks pero más volátil aún.
2878 2018-02-14 00:13:17 Unacceptable! Millennials "Blazed" Our Blue Chip Stocks !!
2879 2018-02-14 00:13:09 Stocks is the way to go. As an investor ask yourself what rate of return are you comfortable with. I you want growth or captain appreciation or dividends.  If you want between 10-20% you can pull your gains when you are at that point.

2887 2018-02-14 00:07:40 Let’s hope tomorrow’s inflation report is worse than expected; that the market overreacts & stocks plunge as a result. More intense swings & volatility. Bring it on! All it means is more great discounts, more great buying opportunities, & more lucrative short-term profits.
