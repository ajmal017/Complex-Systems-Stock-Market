36 2018-06-09 20:47:03 What I’d tell my 20yr old self.
- Let that gal go play ball
- Don’t get married 
- learn to trade commodities 
- move from MN 
- real estate real estate
- learn floor systems
- Just Keep Going
37 2018-06-09 20:42:46 it's just a way of structuring the market. Robert Miner says it only works 1/2 of the time. So he is not a religious devotee of the approach. Most of the trouble comes when you try to impose a  5 wave pattern on all rallies etc. Many commodities  rally in zig zag fashion etc

40 2018-06-09 20:29:41 why can't people just enjoy their music and cheer them on?. they aren't our boyfriends LMAO. i don't understand why people treat them like they are commodities.
41 2018-06-09 20:20:07 YIKES I'm so sorry

That's the thing about amenities and commodities is that they're built to be desirable, and in the stupidest fucking ways

Why the fuck would people want half the shit people make, and yet... I do.
42 2018-06-09 20:07:55 Ha ha! Never tried that indicator! Have to try it!!! Have  you been using it for long? I love all the info you share on commodities - we need to swap some info  I love day trading but swing is my fave  
43 2018-06-09 20:00:21 nem tudo foi gambiarra, não foi a partir de 2008 e vcs esquecem que houve uma queda brutal na receita,por causa da queda do preço das commodities. deveríamos estar preparados para isso, mas os governos falharam nisso (e em outras coisas tb,como a política dos campeões nacionais).

45 2018-06-09 19:54:53 I am yet to read anyne acknowledging the impact of the Financial Crisis in Zuma's 1st, and Commodities crunch in his 2nd term, along with wildly damaging external factors taking place in US and EU thruout his two terms. They lie & say SA was not affected by 2008. That's hogwash!
46 2018-06-09 19:53:28 Equities and commodities are wildly removed enough, but properties and currency have nothing to do with either directly, yet they're all interconnected. And the only thing he's famous for is buying buildings and running hotels and apartments.
47 2018-06-09 19:51:00 SA relies on Mining almost entirely. How can we ignore the prolonged commodities crunch during Zuma's administration? There are a lot of falsehoods and half-truths that were peddled for political gain. Can we please have sober minds now to interrogate the truth?
48 2018-06-09 19:50:19 The world is watching to see if we can pull back from the economic decline that Obama orchestrated. Don’t disappoint us in restoring our nation to Constitutional Limited Government, with a currency backed by commodities owned by us, and a net trade balance with our partners. MAGA

57 2018-06-09 18:54:54 @FoxNews Only the Americans love fast food, new shoes, parties ,concerts,buy houses, or have 5 TVs in their house. So USA is the biggest consumer of all goods & commodities: USA is the land of milk & honey—hence, illegals are flocking.

70 2018-06-09 18:00:12 On the 9th of June 2018 I'd like to remind all of you that NOT ALL marginalised/disenfranchised people out there choose to join or support murderous death cults that terrorise minorities & enslave women/sell them as commodities.
Please share this with all terrorism apologists.
71 2018-06-09 17:55:51 Or we lower costs of food for our people so we all eat well raise cost of our exports we have excess yes most of the world cannot feed their ppl without importing we dont have to cheat our farmers trying to be cheapest on required needed commodities.

75 2018-06-09 17:33:02 Rights and commodities are two different things.
76 2018-06-09 17:31:34 Cheers. the supply/demand thesis applicable for the general run of commodities does not affect land/house prices in the same way - that, we know,. I agree with you, we need a LVT, but thats a different conversation
77 2018-06-09 17:22:03 Raw product turned into stretch commodities chemically. Illegal in Law of Nature.
78 2018-06-09 17:21:38 I have heard the bogus "cost of production" argument with commodities for forty years. The only cost of production that matters is that of the lowest cost producers.
79 2018-06-09 17:11:33 One govt reduced petrol price. That increased disposable income and reduced price of commodities. A govt that love the masses

84 2018-06-09 16:44:32 As these two commodities are so dissimilar - perhaps you could find a nation or area that does college in a free market method and demonstrates excellence and value.
85 2018-06-09 16:35:32 Keep working Fábio, your chance will come. Heart, desire and commitment are highly rated commodities. 

Don't give up.

4.high tax rate for beginners.

●economy and prices of desired commodities/things in d Country

●Standard of living?

Corruption fight is all political while economic benefit will be for all
90 2018-06-09 16:15:14 @realDonaldTrump A visual aid for tariffs might help...how about a simple matrix with products/commodities on one side and countries across the top within each cell would be the tariffs that country charges for that commodity; include U.S. in the list.
91 2018-06-09 16:11:13 I was born in Canada & saw the rise of milk & egg boards who destroyed eggs, milk, & cheese to raise the price of these commodities. They also charge ridiculous tariffs for the same reason. The US & canada have been screwed by this socialist policy. US has survived by hard work.

98 2018-06-09 15:34:32 It's because fans of big clubs only see players as commodities to buy or sell, whereas people like us see them as humans
99 2018-06-09 15:31:09 I rest my case about the cult members. No, other countries have not been taking advantage of the US. Trade is much more complex than who buys more or less from one country or the other, or tariffs on individual commodities.
100 2018-06-09 15:22:47 Yes like Farage himself a commodities trader wasn't he. An ideologue hankering for a rose tinted past.
101 2018-06-09 15:18:30 One more burden created by TN Govt. on public which was already facing difficulties due to skyrocketing prices of essential commodities, thanks to frequent increase in prices of  petroleum products.
102 2018-06-09 15:10:42 There are collectors who want signed copies of the first edition of a writer's first published work, in case that writer becomes hugely successful. Sort of a commodities thing. 
But this is a bit strange. Did he include info about himself?
103 2018-06-09 14:57:30 Anthony Bourdain’s suicide shows us all that no matter how much adventure, new experiences or enjoyment someone appears to have, inner peace and contentment are rare commodities x
104 2018-06-09 14:38:55 Been grocery shopping lately? Milk jumped 20%, last mo. and expected to hit $5 /gallon according to commodity investors in Wall Street. Commodities futures are solid investment for the 4% of the US who have $ to invest
105 2018-06-09 14:34:28 2003-2006 was the last time US ran up a big deficit: see how Teck, Barrick & Suncor surged. Commodities in general.

116 2018-06-09 13:43:18 Sheffield could suck in the majors no one has seen him pitch in the bigs, Andujar could just be a rookie flash in the pan, I think Frazier will be good. But that’s not enough. That’s gambling when we already have proven commodities we can build around. We’re a bat or two away!!
117 2018-06-09 13:40:41 Rainfally activity to significantly reduce from 12th June to 19th June.  DRY SPELL OF MONSOON. Let's c how agro commodities respond.

149 2018-06-09 11:38:26 Why the 270% tariffs?  There is a reason the Canadians flock over the border and buy American merchandise....especially big ticket items , like tires for their cars.  It is so much cheaper here. They pay for their 'free' healthcare through their commodities.

166 2018-06-10 23:41:27 Canada's economy is a blip on the radar. The combined countries of the G7 don't equal our economy. We are the engine that drives the world. I don't want to see the high prices that a tariff war can bring, but it's time that American commodities & manufacturing were fairly treated
167 2018-06-10 23:41:08 We need to subsidize recyclables like we do other commodities.  There is no market for the materials locally.

202 2018-06-10 22:05:38 You’re conflating Chinese dumping and manipulating of commodities markets (rare earths, steel and aluminum) with Canadian production that is integrated across North America? You want reliable, easy, consistent access to resources? Dont rely on third world suppliers.

204 2018-06-10 21:54:55 Amen. I live in the heartland too. I'm amazed just how much these (so called) independent farmers and ranchers depend on the subsidies you mention...and more! There are commodities, provisions for local farmer co-operatives, young farmers programs, and etc. It goes on and on.
205 2018-06-10 21:34:54 I have no problem with good faith negotiating. As I said - if you want a reliable source of strategic commodities, that will require concessions from the US negotiators as well. Canada isn’t going to roll over and capitulate because your president thinks he’s a master negotiator.

208 2018-06-10 21:14:32 Wife’s grandparents in Nebraska have been getting payments for growing wheat for decades. No shame in it, it helps manage the amount of agricultural goods, and influences the cost and supply of such commodities. Keeps people in farming, frankly.
209 2018-06-10 20:53:23 When I was in Zimbabwe for my holiday I realised quickly that I would not survive. The money (bond, US$) confused me so much and commodities are so expensive! Zimbabweans are survivors and I applaud everybody on the ground
210 2018-06-10 20:47:33 Could it be that whosoever owns the Gold and precious medals and gems, owns the monetary wealth of the world, or could it be land and property! Minerals? Commodities!

211 2018-06-10 20:45:03 270% tariffs on American commodities
212 2018-06-10 20:44:24 All the manufacturers have their commodities locked in by contract.  Tariffs won't effect them.  The sky isn't falling...
213 2018-06-10 20:41:31 Fight heartland food tariffs with commodities for food assistance programs.
214 2018-06-10 20:35:46 @FoxNews USA will stay a superpower without the help of the rest of the world. All their goods & commodities will stink without USA. Only Americans spend without limit. The rest of the world shop for clothes or cars after 20 yrs. USA is a big market
215 2018-06-10 20:33:24 Boludo, los precios de las commodities de energía se fijan en los mercados internacionales. Antes el barril de petróleo costaba $8-10, ahora $75, no tiene na q ver con los gobiernos, pobre ignorante vendido amarrahuatos asqueroso
216 2018-06-10 20:32:14 It will cost them a lot more if a hard #brexit is introduced, i.e. being frozen out of European supply chains, losing frictionless #EU export markets, more expensive importation of commodities, goods & services and reduced supply of labour force when FOM stops. #BrexitBritain
217 2018-06-10 20:18:21 Exactly. If you think the Lakers are gonna just sign LeBron and PG and be done, you got another thing coming. Lonzo, Ingram, Kuzma are all hot commodities.
218 2018-06-10 20:15:43 worker coops are a "type" of "capitalism"

Uh, no.
They can and do exist within capitalist societies, making commodities for market exchange. But the class structure of the enterprise, collective ownership, is antithetical to capitalist enterprise structure (owners v workers).
219 2018-06-10 20:09:14 It makes total sense NOT to make low end products here. That frees up our people and resources to make high end products and innovate and invent new products. The future is not in making low end clothes and commodities as we used to. Let a low wage cost nation make them.
220 2018-06-10 19:57:26 Talk to your boards about growth prospects on commodities and create a strategic value plan and sell short.
221 2018-06-10 19:50:01 @realDonaldTrump Why can't Canadian Maple Syrup be sold in the US? There is a lot of other product and commodities than milk. Time to open the books and set it strait. I think you'll be supersized to find that your on the better end over all. So we can fix it.
222 2018-06-10 19:49:24 i m directional trader so use 35..those commodities javing shorter duration..such as indian agri futures..21 may be more good..to solve this issue..we manually maintain spot prices continuous charts with minimum 5 yr data..and for global mkts..we use continuous charts crosschack
223 2018-06-10 19:41:57 The people want commodities distributed to each according to their need!
224 2018-06-10 19:41:50 I’m waiting for those hog, grain, cattle, veggie farmers to fall on trump’s sword. If Canada puts stiff tariffs on those commodities, you can bet Mexico, Japan, Germany, and rest of Europe will do the same. 
Trudeau has already said its G-6 not G-7, omitting trump.
225 2018-06-10 19:34:57 So how has that affected the lives of average Nigerians?
Has it reduced the price of a bag of rice or premium motor spirit or other commodities?
Is that the 24/7 electricity, 5k allowance for unemployed youths,$1=#1 and #45/litre for PMS?
226 2018-06-10 19:34:46 Authenticity is one of today’s most valuable commodities 
227 2018-06-10 19:32:59 President Trump
If we Canada drop the Dairy , Pork an Poultry Tarrifs and open the USA Canadian Border to free trade of the Commodities will You drop the Steel and Aluminum Tarrifs. ?
228 2018-06-10 19:31:27 Since when does it have mean institutions entering the space = up in price? 

Institutions also trade/invest in stocks, forex, commodities, futures... and they go up AND down.
229 2018-06-10 19:29:08 Which is why tariffs on commodities, materials, and parts make the absolute least sense. At least you could argue raising prices on finished products from other countries give US goods a competitive advantage in the US (even if it still a bad idea overall).

231 2018-06-10 19:24:44 Apart from rice, Nigeria is also doing well in other grains,
especially Millet, Sorghum and Maize. We are now the second largest producer of sorghum after the US, the third in millet after India and our breweries are now enjoying local sourcing of those commodities.
232 2018-06-10 19:22:03 Thank you my friend, I am still new to crypto. Applying my knowledge from Commodities here and it seems@to be working so far
233 2018-06-10 19:21:18 To produce agricultural goods under the control of global agribusiness cartels, to be traded on the Chicago Commodities Exchange (interchangeably w/ the same commodities produced elsewhere in the world) w/ agricultural work actually employing less than 5% of the populace?
234 2018-06-10 19:18:22 The fetishism of commodities expresses itself in truly interesting ways.
235 2018-06-10 19:16:27 Sorry, we don’t in fact need you. The world market is more than happy to take our products leaving you to source strategic commodities from places like Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. The knife cuts both ways. Funny how your definition of fairness is reduced to night makes right.
236 2018-06-10 19:12:37 The irony of discussing the equitable trade with those focused upon commodities and many failing to realise they are investing in firms domiciled in Canada or Australia, with assets in China, Canada, South America, South Africa, Australia and Russia.

We are all in this together.
237 2018-06-10 19:06:42 Yes I agree - the ongoing refusal of Palestinians, Gaza esp, to be a 'controlled / managed population' is the overriding contradiction here. And yet even the failures are commodities - the more Iron Dome missiles being fired the happier a large consortium of manufacturers are.
238 2018-06-10 19:05:05 Nope, this is a wrong logical inference, Ben. Free trade is an ideal, and this is Trump’s firm position. US will impose some tariff on those countries that unwilling to voluntarily cancel tariffs against our commodities. Thus, we leverage a play field for further negotiations.
239 2018-06-10 19:02:45 that dumb tweet is so indicative of how the capitalist class has gone global, we are but consumers, subjects to false commodities, and the third world picks up the bill as the new proletarian class..... more to the point its just a fun game of footy for charity, chill out my dude
240 2018-06-10 18:59:37 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
241 2018-06-10 18:51:14 If your not insuring anything but commodities, don't bother.  It's past time to enable farmers to grow actual food.
242 2018-06-10 18:49:28 The fewer nations in a trade deal, the easier for each nation to take their protected industries/commodities off the table. Bilateral deals mean LOTS of protected groups on both sides.
243 2018-06-10 18:48:41 The really sad part is there will be absolutely nothing done about this as long as the VICTIMS are seen as less valuable commodities than the profit generated for such violations.
244 2018-06-10 18:38:16 Being a crypto Trader is equivalent to being a Commodities Trader during the day and a pimp at night @APompliano @timothysykes @dtarian04
245 2018-06-10 18:32:07 Just cherry picked examples. Wtd average tariffs are low because bulk of trade is commodities, like oil, that have no tariff. Can’t compare isolated items under WTO. It’s a series of trade offs. I give you break on A, you give me break on B. Can’t compare tariffs on A or B.
246 2018-06-10 18:17:42 *graças a uma crise econômica instaurada devido a crise de 2011 da UE, da queda do crescimento chinês e na baixa do preço das commodities nós estamos fudidos
Lembrando, existem processos de corrupção desde a Ditadura, a questão é q o combate só teve início no governo do PT
247 2018-06-10 18:07:27 Importation of much needed basic commodities like fuel, food stuff and electricity is what they call externalization of cash, what a shame! As long as we don't produce what is ours for exports forget about cash flowing in Zimbabwe
248 2018-06-10 17:42:57 Farage was a pretty poor commodities broker in a time the market really was the wild west ..... undoubtedly met a connection.
249 2018-06-10 17:36:05 Me: okay. So what socialist countries do you mean?

ML: lists countries that have money, commodities, and trade.

251 2018-06-10 17:21:17 You make 0 fucking sense crypto currency is an "investment" just like stocks/commodities/etc. What are you here for then to twiddle your insults and retarded comments about coins all day? Anyone who says they aren't into crypto for money is a bullshitter and you stink
252 2018-06-10 17:20:55 Point 1: when there is a trade imbalance, the seller needs the buyer to keep buying.
Point 2: if the buyer can afford to stop buying, then the buyer has control.
Point 3: there are very few commodities which the US has to import to supply domestic needs.
253 2018-06-10 17:19:14 Ummmm no they don’t! With a trade war we’ll see how you all do with your commodities and economy
254 2018-06-10 17:19:02 Prices of agriculture commodities are down because of glut.
255 2018-06-10 17:18:21 According to @TheJusticeDept @CivilRights today is international children’s day. What better way to honor youth in America than turn them into commodities for #childtrafficking? @POTUS S.O.S. to #kids4cash #California @JeffSessions #FollowTheWhiteRabbit @Meklorien67
256 2018-06-10 17:14:59 Canada should learn that if it wasn't for America, they'd be dead due to not being to survive on their own w/o our precious commodities. They shouldn't charge their poor citizens exorbitant amounts of money.
257 2018-06-10 17:14:22 Canadian tariffs on ag products have been in place fir decades & are not sole cause of low dairy prices/income for farmers. Canada must protect Canadian farmers as much as required so don't lose the industry. No one country can afford to be so dependent on another for commodities
258 2018-06-10 17:05:17 I am ashamed to be a human- we have no right to treat these wonderful creatures, who share this planet with us,  like disposable commodities -absolutely heart breaking
259 2018-06-10 17:03:34 True, Glenn.  Also some taxpayer subsidies actually prop up the prices of food commodities, making them more expensive by paying farmers to take crop land out of production. Full disclosure: I get a small check from USDA every year for 29 acres of Iowa farmland I inherited.

1. Why farmers commiting suicides?
2.Why jobless/jobloss increasing?
3.R women/girls safe?
4.Y prices of petroleum products nd commodities so much high?

265 2018-06-10 16:38:56 1 - After the GOP destroyed the economy via Reaganomics, Gramm Leech Bliley, and the Commodities Futures Modernization Act, Obama, the adult to take over, worked hard for the ARRA which put a pause on the Second Great Republican Depression.
266 2018-06-10 16:34:29 But the tenure of PMB has been under questioning because people are suffering. Prices of commodities have gone up drastically.  The economy is now for some set of people (bourgeoisie) while the common man(proletariat) is at the mercy of the former #tobecontinued
267 2018-06-10 16:31:37 No. 
I'm old enough to remember standing in line during the OPEC oil embargo. 
For the first time, last week, the USA became energy independent.

269 2018-06-10 16:09:34 We should try to tap sectors such as pharmaceuticals and agriculture — particularly in commodities like rice — in the Chinese market with an aim to bridge the widening trade gap.
270 2018-06-10 15:53:31 We already ship much of the bulk Commodities by rail.
Coal, cotton,  grain,,
271 2018-06-10 15:42:41 O país crescia, porém tudo graças a estabilidade econômica alcançada através do tripé macroeconômico, somado a um ambiente internacional pujante, com China crescendo dois dígitos e demandando commodities!

275 2018-06-10 15:19:28 Actually most women choose part time work when they can freely choose like in Germany and Netherlands. more white middle class Women were forced to work full time because of surpression of male wages and and rapid inflation of basic commodities.
276 2018-06-10 15:17:15 Yes, but there's always the issue of perceived forces, especially with commodities.

Countries play games with price, too. Loss-leaders aren't merely a retail marketing gimmick.

Also consider the received wisdom for many countries is buy American meat.
277 2018-06-10 15:17:07 BitNautic is a trading platform for commodities where importers, exporters, and producers of goods can trade their products all over the globe. #bitnautic
278 2018-06-10 15:15:14 That's because of your 'free healthcare'.  You just pay for it in your commodities.   That's why we Americans are fighting for democracy. ..not socialism.   Nothing in this world is free.
279 2018-06-10 14:50:21 So women are now commodities? We need the opinion of chimamanda. 
280 2018-06-10 14:49:10 You’re in the minority. Everything is motivated by sex, and selling theirselves as commodities. I just can’t cope with it. I’m glad you’ve found a balance with it, and have love
281 2018-06-10 14:46:58 I guess I must be one of those stupid people @amyklobuchar who believes that massive foreign investment does NOT justify huge trade deficits with other countries. And as my example @RWPMinnesota @TinaSmithMN I select Minnesota and our commodities-based economy. @StarTribune #wcco
282 2018-06-10 14:43:28 Great for Provenance and security of artworks.  However, very nervous of art being "traded" as other commodities. Significantly different than "ordinary" financial trade.
283 2018-06-10 14:38:33 Where is all the love...the gay community seems to be solely motivated by sex. Where are the examples of monogamy and trust. It’s all so seedy and base, guys as commodities. Heartbreaking. I must be a complete freak, and also completely alone. So so sad 
284 2018-06-10 14:36:08 It’s insanity.  Economies are built on global markets and suppliers. The US can’t make cars or iPhones or computers, or sell commodities or services etc without trading partners. We can’t sell coke or jeans or whiskey w/o trading agreements.
285 2018-06-10 14:34:49 Surprisingly relevant to my time here in Norway too, where small farms are kept alive not for production of commodities, but out of respect for tradition and the good they do the ecology of the hills. But, they are on a different scale of intensity to typical practice at home.
286 2018-06-10 14:31:24 Rohinga are top of mind.. and Yemenese and Palestinian Arabs.
Refugees from Syria and the MIDDLE EAST all drought and war or despot affected people are also top of mind.
Civilized countries export peaceful commodities like food, blankets, clean water and medicine and NOT WEAPONS!

Rahul should ask himself what Congress did ?
if the Congressmen So called farmers r taught to throwing milk and vegetables.
He never told not to throw these essential commodities could be distributed in SC/ST poorer.
Where is the thoughts of congress.
The feudalist.
290 2018-06-10 14:24:41 ...for pieces of the companies & contracts for guaranteed-low energy prices. That’s a huge advantage for decades. (China commonly does this for commodities from other countries around the world—which is how it’s able to flood markets with cheaper commodities/products.)
291 2018-06-10 14:09:29 Couple Of Y’all Some Hot Commodities On Here Na
292 2018-06-10 14:04:27 I'm already seeing the signs,  the commodities markets are in disarray over the tariffs. The so called labor shortage? I see plenty of listings for jobs that should pay at least 25 dollars an hour only paying 14 or 15. Electrician by trade. Seeing similar conditions as in 06 & 07
293 2018-06-10 14:01:47 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
294 2018-06-10 13:56:29 The US dollar should stop being the dominant currency too - Commodities & other things should not be traded in USD - time for cryptos?
295 2018-06-10 13:55:19 It’s already taken. Fixed income, currencies and commodities

297 2018-06-10 13:34:27 Ask yourself: who benefits from a breakdown between the US and its closest allies over trade of steel, aluminum and other commodities?  Well, the Russian companies that produce those things, and certain GOP members who are their partners.
298 2018-06-10 13:24:13 Larry says poor @realDonaldTrump got his feelings hurt. @jaketapper should've mentioned the U. S. also has high tariffs on certain protected commodities like peanuts. Kudlow is an ass just like Trump.
299 2018-06-10 13:24:09 It’s already starting, denying Americans; assistance, healthcare, pharmacy, insurance, banks, housing, education, food.  Now he is moving into trades and commodities, soon we will be in food line to get bread, if lucky left over from tRUMPs KFC.  Military is next!
300 2018-06-10 13:17:51 Esse vale tudo eleitoral é ridículo. Querem colocar o FHC no mesmo barco sujo que o Lula. Opa aí ó! Não vamos igualar um homem que salvou a economia, promoveu reformas e privatizações positivas ao país, com um vigarista que surfou nas commodities e institucionalizou a corrupção.
301 2018-06-10 13:15:27 #Newborn4sale @javeednusrat @HamidMirPAK @OfficialDGISPR more than 1,200 infants have been sold out like commodities from Allied Hospital & retail stores FSD but no worries these were not COAS, CJP, IG or any MNA / MPA kids born to rule.
302 2018-06-10 13:13:28 Agreed re: the importance of reading China's intent via their actions.  Yet so many read Chinese gold purchases, CNY oil contract, ceasing to add to UST stockpiles, building carrier-killer missiles, & stockpiling commodities as "curiosities" rather than a read on intent.
303 2018-06-10 13:00:49 @AbidSherAli @RajaRiaz_Ahmed @CMShehbaz @MaryamNSharif @OfficialDGISPR @KlasraRauf Infants are being auctioned in Allied Hospital FSD like purchasable commodities....N biggest irony that IG Punjab police, politicians of FSD & rulers for 40 yrs are not yet hanged publically...
304 2018-06-10 12:54:48 @vinayak_jain Hv U ever called the Electric Utility company to thank them for providing you uninterrupted power supply to your home for the last 31 days???Probably not. But when there is a power cut for 10 mins at home? Everyone calls & yells. Essential commodities impact all.
305 2018-06-10 12:46:37 For them soldiers are commodities that carry no value except that they’re expendables and use and throw type of stuff. They will flog them even after they amaze supreme sacrifices for political gains. All are same
306 2018-06-10 12:45:14 This is NOT the way you re-negotiate trade deals.  Your ego, your lies, your utter and complete lack of civility are already killing the commodities market.  The Art of the Deal won't work here.  Grow up.

310 2018-06-10 12:05:12 Looks like they are at the beginning stages of proving that theory wrong. Read what has been written by other countries in the last 2 days. The US is not the only source of goods and commodities, and people forget, other nations hold our debt. They can call it at any time.
311 2018-06-10 12:04:15 They lost all the money to their corrupt apetite and now finding new ways to impose taxes on commodities in different ways. Eventually its the people who will be burdened. Well it would make no difference if its called Camel cess or cow cess.The  money will go into their pockets.
312 2018-06-10 11:58:17 These must be the dumbest drug lords in the universe, they sell commodities worth million $ sale added value, without much more work then debulking the goods, for pennies?!
313 2018-06-10 11:32:55 You can’t escape from oil dependency there’s a reason oil is the most traded commodities on planet. 
Even more traded than gold.

-any importer?

those bringing clothes?
those brining basic commodities?

-cross border traders?

325 2018-06-10 08:56:49 Is this how hyperinflation starts? As a result of other commodities competing with Bitcoin for energy, their cost of production increases resulting in increased prices across the board, further devaluing traditional currencies. 

We're probably a long way away from this scenario.

341 2018-06-10 07:42:58 are you selling commodities? please drop the "as little as" phrase.
342 2018-06-10 07:42:14 For nonessential commodities, their inherent value is nothing but illusional.
343 2018-06-10 07:39:20 Prohibition has NEVER worked. No amount of legislation or law enforcement has worked. Instead turn #drugs into profitable commodities, entrenching corruption, enriching organised crime, devastating society. Taxing the sale of regulated drugs would fix the economy forever #auspol
344 2018-06-10 07:27:01 It's promoting donating money to people in need rather than spending it on "useless" luxuries, comparing prices of vain items such as aftershaves and handbags to life sustaining commodities such as access to clean water or proper housing. No?

354 2018-06-10 06:45:01 6. As the shaded zones in 4. and 5 show, Emerging Markets have, in 2018, somewhat decoupled from commodities; they are moving in more or less different directions.

356 2018-06-10 06:43:52 2. Emerging Markets are basically 70% to 90% commodities. What I mean by this:
357 2018-06-10 06:29:24 1 deflationary Macro period of liquidity trap, commodities supercycle, not so strong growth. 2 microelectronics-AI (cheaper hardware&software) keep going: how/when a structural inflation might be back? Monopoly affects the allocation of such surplus welfare

359 2018-06-10 06:24:52 Russia lifted oil output to 11.1m b/d during first wk of June, Interfax reported. Probably not surprising considering Moscow breached #OPEC limits for past three months, based on official monthly output data. #OOTT Count down to Vienna meeting is on .. @business  # Commodities
360 2018-06-10 06:23:29 Assume they shot down every NK government official after peace is made. Then they send all of the poor North Koreans to China or South Korea and leave them there under some program. Then, make the old NK a big warehouse for chinese goods and commodities or wtvr. Now THATS an idea

364 2018-06-10 05:43:16 They do have very high duties on dairy and other commodities coming into their country from the United States.
365 2018-06-10 05:35:52 So free trade for all!!   We shall open our borders to commodities now,  instead of just illegal refugees
366 2018-06-10 05:32:37 MacDonalds, Pepsi, etc, are dying even if doesn't look that

One produces commodities

The rest? Services and subject to regulatory issues very, very soon in Europe
367 2018-06-10 05:32:17 A general consensus among all countries be reached sponsored by UNO that commodities which can be produced by masses will not be produced in factories with a view to improving employment, environment, equity.Also all countries resolve to reduce expenditure drastically on defence.
368 2018-06-10 05:31:15 Ok. I will rephrase the question.
Where are the underlying commodities for the trades undertaken on the spot exchange?? Where they all only on papers?
369 2018-06-10 05:18:57 China has a 25% tariff in autos. Canada and Germany subsidize their commodities to gain global market share and thus to crush US industry. It has. In 2017 alone the trade deficit was $568B. Now look up in your dictionary how this is “fair trade” for anyone but our “allies” Ian.
370 2018-06-10 05:18:48 Tarifs are not illegals, a country can put tarif for market protections and etc...  And it has to be on a certain guideline. In Canada dairy farmers can't make even if the prices of certains commodities are too low. That's is we have certain tarifs, so  our farmer can make even.
371 2018-06-10 04:55:07 1. “Commodities” are items that are bought and sold, whether the selling entity is “for profit” or not. 

2. The state employs wage labor all the time.
372 2018-06-10 04:39:06 As I said he has no experience in commodities nor finance. He should go back to selling jewelry tags.
373 2018-06-10 04:36:23 I'm just going to toss this one out there...
Does anybody remember @realDonaldTrump, in 2016, saying he wanted to "make food taste good again"?
I wonder if he is planning on taking on the #GMO and Steroid problem in the Agri/Livestock Industries?
#USA #Trump #Commodities #G7
374 2018-06-10 04:16:37 A solid take but if commodities hit > repatriation effect then he’s screwed. I feel like the middle class feels commodities hikes faster than future investment based on ephemeral trade deals. I may be underestimating the ability of domestic commodities to ramp up.
375 2018-06-10 04:02:44 Accuracy and reality in politics are rare commodities, as is justice.  The absence of it in #auspol concerns me.  It causes me to get a bit pedantic about such things.  For me Turnbull was utterly hamstrung where Joyce is concerned because of the Coalition Agreement.
376 2018-06-10 03:53:53 Asus eh lahat nman ngbabayad ng tax even those na jobless they paid tax out of their purchase commodities. No need to emphasize or to make sumbat.
377 2018-06-10 03:42:49 E di magconcentrate k nman sa ejk, high prices of basic commodities,  gaso price hike, traffic, crimes anytime, abuse of authority at iba pa. Marami yan, pre.
378 2018-06-10 03:41:50 Then the dumbest thing you can do is make raw materials & commodities more expensive.
379 2018-06-10 03:15:48 So you think Canada, Mexico , China etc etc get to send their commodities , cars , steel , food . It cost them for example $10 dollars. When we send ours over there however it cost us $50 dollars. You tell me what’s fair about that
380 2018-06-10 03:11:22 Os que passaram para a classe média na base da canetada você quer dizer? Desde quando R$300 é classe média! Faça-me o favor! E aqueles que ascenderam das classes D e E foram aleijados do trem em movimento, pois o modelo não era sustentável e estava lastrado nas commodities $$$!
381 2018-06-10 03:08:43 Why not bypass the intermediaries and add it directly to your poop? Saves a lot of doubt, and the poop could possibly be sold on the commodities market by some Milo Minderbinder type.
382 2018-06-10 03:00:10 ¿Por qué la economía planchada y al borde de un colapso bolchevique no fastidiaba hace apenas seis años, corriendo 2012, con el tándem Cristina-Kicillof?

¿Por qué no se le perdona a Macri la falta de un commodities boom como a principios de centuria?

383 2018-06-10 02:45:27 "To succeed in business, you must build a brand and never destroy it. One competitive advantage I had when I ventured into manufacturing was my brand 'Dangote', which I diligently built in the course of my trading commodities."

- Alhaji Aliko Dangote | Dangote Group
384 2018-06-10 02:37:31 Tariffs on steel and aluminum are going to make manufacturing relying on these commodities less competitive. Tariffs are going to cost jobs - but you would also have to work harder to buy the more expensive goods affected by tariffs.
385 2018-06-10 02:34:59 .@IANMCGUGAN discusses ways to invest in commodities: futures contracts or ETFs and shares of major commodities producers. Missed out on the juniors! Shares available in public markets like @tsx_tsxv and private placements, which are a key part of #HoweStreet business culture.
386 2018-06-10 02:31:48 Capitalism is a system of ownership dumbass.  The production of commodities doesn’t exist solely under capitalism
387 2018-06-10 02:30:39 So, tell me. What is so green with shipping coal 6000 miles for china to produce basic commodities at no standards? Just to ship to Canada to flood their market and pass their excess down to the US. Might as well, ship china steel straight to the US.
388 2018-06-10 02:29:43 Not only California is a Sanctuary Cities, most Homeless people and everything are very expensive when it comes to rent, housing, taxes, gasoline, commodities except Marijuana. The leftist leaders in California legalized Marijuana because its a Billion dollars business. Greedy.

391 2018-06-10 02:08:45 barriers to entry into markets and tarrifs which make it hard for the US to export out commodities into foreign markets .... it’s not free trade at that point... basic Economics
392 2018-06-10 02:08:01 Supposed frantic parents made a conscious decision to make these kids into criminals ! Like thieves inbvading to plunder others commodities !
393 2018-06-10 02:04:36 That is how the business world thinks, traditionally. Times are changing. Before blockchain, you can 'hire' and 'fire' these brains, like commodities. Not amymore. These same nerds now control money. The value, "money",and medium of exchange is the same.

395 2018-06-10 01:43:39 +on all the heretic states, roaming the countryside in jeeps with machine guns, raping & pillaging the Hindus of the states, until they submitted to the RSS. Just remember to stack up on essential commodities & build strong doors & walls when they come [if they come].
396 2018-06-10 01:42:09 Las misiones comerciales a Angola y Vietnam del Sur, tan criticadas entonces, a la luz de los números se revelan PERTINENTES y EFICACES.
La devaluación favorece exportar commodities; las misiones comerciales atendiendo ése indicador (entre otras cosas), valor agregado.
397 2018-06-10 01:37:18 What happens when the cost of materials required for manufacturing go up?  What happens when there are no longer competing prices in the market place?  What happens when the availability of commodities goes down?
398 2018-06-10 01:32:56 Adorei a aulada companheira sobre precificação. De commodities
399 2018-06-10 01:31:40 We need to take the same early eighties approach to steel and aluminium, and many more commodities, companies can sell as much as they want, no tariffs, but with limits on imports and the rest manufactured here.

That is called fair trade, and that's what we need
400 2018-06-10 01:19:26 Add commodities..side project..take delivery of 1 livestock...pig, cow, etc....:)
401 2018-06-10 01:16:21 I don't follow agri-commodities.
402 2018-06-10 01:11:54 We can all find product groups and commodities for which Canada’s tariffs are higher than the US’s. The fact is that  buys more from  than it sells to . No trade surplus as Trump falsely claims.
403 2018-06-10 01:06:22 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
404 2018-06-10 00:48:31 A tariff is just a list of commodities but is used occasionally as shorthand for a customs duty. E.g. The 280% Canadian milk tariff is a tax the Canadian government charges a Canadian company for importing all non-Canadian milk to ensure relief for the constant dairy surplus.
405 2018-06-10 00:45:09 Trump family has used women as commodities for generations. The Evangelicals don’t care, though.
406 2018-06-10 00:32:50 Just as we measure & subsidize our farmers for certain commodities, so does Canada. There is more involved than just trade: measures that ensure the demand for food in their country is met, etc. These are promises made to their own farmers.
407 2018-06-10 00:28:52 HODL is only good advice for commodities and securities that are appreciating. 

Although Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash will appreciate in the future, the many many shitcoins will genuinely tulip and be eliminated.
408 2018-06-10 00:22:45 Russia had all kinds of reasons to destabilise the West beyond commodities. Don't flatter them as the cause, there are enough idiots in England & Wales with misplaced reservations about the EU influenced by tabloid lies harking back to when the Sun never set on Britain's Empire.
409 2018-06-10 00:20:47 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
410 2018-06-10 00:18:02 First of all women are people, they're not things or commodities that you can buy.
They're not objects that you can acquire or bribe even. They deserve respect. 
So please STOP giving women MONEY. Show them RESPECT bafetho.

414 2018-06-08 23:52:11 It’s not about farmers going to Canada, it’s about Canada blocking our farm commodities with high tarrifs.

Are their businesses experiencing unprecedented growth? Does Buhari dash them money? Suffering and smiling.
448 2018-06-08 20:34:53 Concordo, mas carros não são batatas. Consumer Goods , por mt q custe a economistas, n podem ser tratados como Commodities. Mesmo Batatas depende de hábitos alimentares e culturais. Mas percebi o ponto. Curiosidade: sabes qual o país do mundo com maior produção auto per capita?
449 2018-06-08 20:33:52 I too learned of her efforts. Very brave lady to go up against a $$$ industry turning kids into commodities. Can u support the above petition ( it's the image )? CA residency not required.

453 2018-06-08 20:13:28 On a side note, if you’re looking to financial news sources to get info before investing you have already lost. Talking heads on TV do not have the home investor’s best interest in mind when reporting on stocks, currencies, commodities, or anything else.
454 2018-06-08 20:10:37 because Russia had nukes, was a superpower, had strategic control of key commodities, was moving to capitalism. 1998, Yeltsin in charge.

459 2018-06-08 20:02:05 Perhaps the labor market participation shifts from the low end closer to the middle. Leaving the shortage in a different place (net positive). Not really talking the final assembly, I more meant the production of the rolled commodities. Regardless, I love your content.

461 2018-06-08 19:52:32 SOMETIMES YES, SOMETIMES NO. AS I RECALL, THE OFFER HAS TO BE VERY SPECIFIC AND IS SUBJECT TO ALL SORTS OF REASONABILITY REQUIREMENTS.

477 2018-06-08 19:04:38 Agreed this is the time of the emporia. The label implies a more economic than administrative/symbolic function. Certainly very solidly trade-oriented, and attracting strong interest from kings, bishops, etc. as sources of profit and commodities.
478 2018-06-08 19:04:10 Gut punch to lose a human who in many ways turned empathy (currently one of our rarest and most precious commodities) into a key part of his life's work. RIP Anthony Bourdain.

484 2018-06-08 18:53:46 Good for you for spinning this. I never said a child shouldn't be fed, educated, or safely housed. I asked a simple question.

486 2018-06-08 18:46:29 All of the stories of business success will fade heading into the mid-terms. @POTUS tariffs are increasing the cost of commodities, with in turn hikes the cost of Manufactured goods. Expect a new round of inflation. Probable recession

525 2018-06-08 16:15:08 The shift from QE to QT has already been felt in emerging markets. Future rises in interest rates and liquidity tightening could be felt in the commodities markets as traders derisk and inventories are drawn down to reduce debt. Time will tell

564 2018-06-08 12:42:38 Marx's major flaw is that he ties a Labor Theory of Value (LTV) to the production of commodities only. The mere existence of today's service-based economy is sufficient evidence that capitalism can facilitate productive people contributing to quality-of-life as well.

571 2018-06-08 11:58:40 The market prices for most commodities across the country are well below the MSPs because there is no central procurement to arrest the collapse in prices. The farmers are committing suicides n those who protest are being punished severely by the police #FarmersWithPM
572 2018-06-08 11:58:38 It will always be true, because easy-to-build companies would, by their nature, either be naively entering saturated markets or their products would be commodities from the start. Easy business is doomed business.
573 2018-06-08 11:57:15 Yeah, and they'll sell our #TreasuryNotes then what? The #Dollar will #LoseIt s #value  then #Commodities prices will increase.

583 2018-06-08 11:24:19 UK was last at 100% sufficiency in native commodities in the 1980s. Of course I don't advocate a nationalist autarky; that's economically non-sensical. But we should be conscious as a nation that full shelves don't just appear. They require planning & policy.
584 2018-06-08 11:21:25 The prices of basic consumption commodities are continuously rising, some are starving and dying, and some barely making it. Drug prices are also rising, the health care system is ruined.
585 2018-06-08 11:05:04 3238: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
586 2018-06-08 10:54:52 It is the same with fossil fuels. Also, we wouldn't need to import aluminum and steel if we had mandatory recycling for the metals we already have on hand. Both are also commodities the market is awash with.
587 2018-06-08 10:47:31 Steel is the major one, but if there are less import taxes then commodities, produce and more.
588 2018-06-08 10:37:26 Just so it's said - just in case my kids one day find this timeline from their dad - let me say this: 

Get up earlier than you need to and enjoy the day, enjoy the world, before it gets to busy to notice.  Fleeting moments are the most precious commodities in life.
589 2018-06-08 10:36:10 People spend more when they have more money. The demand on commodities rises.

598 2018-06-08 09:52:45 I believe food security is a basic adjunct of national security and you cannot put a price or cost on it. It's not a 'market' issue and shouldn't be traded away for political or economic advantage. As near as possible to 100% in native commodities would be the ideal.

606 2018-06-08 08:37:07 If your delivery is not up to the mark, customers need to be informed about it so we don’t use amazon. How is it that snapdeal and flip kart deliver so fast ? We can’t wait endlessly for essential commodities that we need urgently. This amounts to fooling customers!
607 2018-06-08 08:37:03 And in one tweet you've shown how out of touch you really are and how little you know about football and the working class. Clearly you also believe that money and greed are more important commodities than loyalty and fairness!

609 2018-06-08 08:34:27 Actually it's the *supply* that rises. And as the supply of money rises, the individual dollar loses its value in relation to other commodities and its purchasing power falls.

637 2018-06-08 06:01:57 By aiming to implement far more radical approaches to housing than the Labour Party wants to? It is ideological at the core. It’s about still seeing houses as commodities. And that’s a fundamental ideological difference I have with your party.
638 2018-06-08 05:50:27 It’s the principle I am talking about. Not at all equating laptops to sanitary napkins. Procuring commodities and distributing is not similar to making medicines available at PHCs whose state we can all agree needs to be improved l.

667 2018-06-08 02:34:10 Hey Toni, I was curious if there was a sector in the market such as, commodities, tech, or utilities that's in its optimal trading stage/ cycle. Or do you trade leading stocks in  different sectors, as long as they meet technical prerequisites. Thanks in advance.
668 2018-06-08 02:31:23 Wealth is created by labor. That's true in any system. But instead of producing commodities to be sold for the profit of private individuals on the market, we can produce goods for use, to meet society's needs.
669 2018-06-08 02:29:27 i'm still fuckin psyched! 
crypto is the shit and nothing like it out there 

it's a little boring right now but imagine being in a commodities bear market for 5  years lol that shit would be much worse 

above 6k is fine
670 2018-06-08 02:23:43 as i said, discussions on the matter are welcome, but let us make sure we are talking about the real concern at hand, which is the inflationary effects on basic household commodities, and if the recent tax reform really has minimal effect on  price increases of said commodities

672 2018-06-08 01:58:30 Yep—As Interest Rates Continue to Rise—Commodities & Bond Prices Will Fall!
673 2018-06-08 01:56:50 Emerging inflation, weaker dollar, robust demand, inventories under control, labour unrest, lower grades and ageing mines - no wonder it's heading higher! #copper #metals #mining #dollar #inflation #commodities #resources
674 2018-06-08 01:54:22 en China hay un boom de consumo cono en el 2001, ahora pasa lo mismo, este super ciclo de los commodities es la demanda china. @ipejorgecastro @hhdospierre No hay que preocuparse por los pronósticos entonces
675 2018-06-08 01:53:12 You cannot buy dairy products at U.S. prices in Canada because the government granted dairy farmers a monopoly on milk production. It’s called supply management. Tariff walls in the 200% to 300% range prevent the import of supply-managed commodities.
676 2018-06-08 01:50:31 continuamos conversando  con Jorge Castro @ipejorgecastro @hhdospierre Los commodities están creciendo , el cobre en abril aumentó un 19% por ejemplo, pasa con todos los metales y con el petróleo
677 2018-06-08 01:43:34 @narendramodi As such when I went around i found lot of commodities available and sold out in chennai wherein i don't have any money.I heard of Mudra loan.Hope i can start a business of dry grapes and clothing ladies from Surat to earn extra income. Pl help me to get mudra loan.
678 2018-06-08 01:41:26 Cost of living, as well as most goods and commodities increase every year. Gas is up because 2 of the top 3 producing nations throttled back production to raise prices. Luckily the top producing nation (the U.S.) increased production to slow the price rise.
679 2018-06-08 01:37:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
680 2018-06-08 01:35:39 300ML NSW Murray Zone 10 GS sells for $2230/ML - price has changed, but so have the motivations I think. Decreasing supply of finite resource and strong capital interest in certain commodities...

682 2018-06-08 01:23:56 I’ve always wanted to put my knowledge and academic skills to the test by doing trades on commodities and other CFD’s.
683 2018-06-08 01:21:16 I went broke trading commodities 4 the first time #janfeeders
684 2018-06-08 01:14:39 Always know half of the story. If China allowed free flow of commodities, money and labor, the economy would have experienced huge flucations. The free market logic doesn't always apply to that stage of economy
685 2018-06-08 01:10:34 Is a trading platform for commodities where importers, exporters, and producers of goods can trade their products all over the globe. #cryptocurrency 
Very promissing and interesting project!

686 2018-06-08 01:10:06 2/in periods of persistent inflation shocks (like 70’s) or persistent negative growth shocks (like the 30’s and post war period) you need to expand into commodities, TIPS & maybe non-correlated alternatives and the ensure better risk balance i.e. much less equity risk exposure.
687 2018-06-08 01:01:34 Over the past decades, they've been playing a big role in the world's economy, and attracting international commodities buyers with financial contracts denominated in their currency may just be the start of a global economic shift.
688 2018-06-08 00:55:48 "The CIA used BCCI to funnel millions of dollars to the fighters battling the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. (Osama) Bin Laden had accounts in the bank, U.S. officials said. The bank also specialized in dealing in commodities such as diamonds and gold."
689 2018-06-08 00:54:55 Will this event discuss the possible application of blockchain to other things in our lives or is it centered around currency/commodities?
690 2018-06-08 00:54:21 Colonialism was all about wiping out cultures in favour of commerce. It treats people, land and nature as nothing more than commodities.
Unfortunately in our consumer culture we still live that way.
We all need to seek our roots and start nurturing them 
691 2018-06-08 00:51:49 Please invade us for abusing you over dairy and other commodities and products. Then make us the 51st through 63rd states, and that will improve the overall economic and sociological conditions in North(ern) America. In a real estate sense, it will improve the property values.

694 2018-06-08 00:50:06 That book is so, so bad, that its author regretted writing it after he learned a bit of economics. Better grab a copy of Del Buen Salvaje al Buen Revolucionario.

Answers: dependence on commodities, weak institutions, mediocre work ethics.
695 2018-06-08 00:45:44 Mix of mid-cap, large-cap, commodities, and bonds. Diversified risk. It’s like the lottery, but for smart people.
696 2018-06-08 00:30:19 Thank you for warning.

You may benefit from reading the short four page introduction Nassim Taleb wrote for the book written by his teacher, Commodities and Commodity Derivatives: Modeling and Pricing for Agricultural, Metals and Energy.
697 2018-06-08 00:26:23 Chinese trade data out 1pm Sydney time. If exports miss, commodities should take a hit
698 2018-06-08 00:23:34 ppl are apathetic commodities who pretend caring in direct proportion to ur perceived wealth
699 2018-06-08 00:17:17 Mis amores. No nos gusta el FMI. Ok. Estoy de acuerdo la pregunta es por qué nos patinamos la guita cuando el viento venía de cola no solo en commodities si no en confianza???? ahora agua y ajo.

Dairy has a significant presence in all of the provinces of Canada and is one of the top two agricultural commodities in seven out of ten provinces.

Why should they buy US dairy when it is already a MAJOR industry in Canada?
701 2018-06-08 00:10:33 Not to mention the Candian government heavily, heavily substadized the Candian farmer to guarantee prices all the while flooding our market with cheap commodities! Just try to ship a load of grain to Canada during harvest!  No fair trade there just list to Canada squealing.
702 2018-06-08 00:10:16 I guess when they are unemployed, no public assistance available, prices have put basic commodities out of reach, loved ones dying of treatable conditions, maybe then they might realize exactly what they supported. . . Nah, too stupid.

704 2018-06-08 00:09:10 I think they meant to say the paper bills! 

Crypto currencies aren’t money, they are a medium of (value) exchange, just like a credit-card is. At best (if in limited supply) crypto currencies are commodities like gold and silver.
705 2018-06-08 00:07:59 O maior problema é que, diferentemente de 2002, não há muita perspectiva para diminuir depois. Não haverá boom das commodities e nem acho que Gomes agradará o mercado como Lula.
706 2018-06-08 00:05:27 Why are we trading proven commodities for guys that can’t play in the league?
707 2018-06-08 00:03:42 If they can do it without giving up someone noteworthy, then I’m ok with it. But none of the known commodities. Just don’t think he’s worth it.
