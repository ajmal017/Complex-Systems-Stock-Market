So, for max. reward, logic dictates that one should invest in the fastest growing businesses with long growth runways, and do so when they are fairly valued.

42 2019-05-21 23:45:34 Yeah and so was humiliating people by placing them in the stocks. How would you like anything thrown at you cos I'm sure you'd be first to shout about it. No one has a right to throw anything at another person regardless and its still assault.

56 2019-05-21 23:38:25 investors have flooded the stock market in the last two days looking for high yield stocks like the big banks. With thousands of coming retirees having had super since 1983 they will invest in the same. There is a coming tsunami of franking credits to break any budget.
57 2019-05-21 23:37:09 The clear risk now is that because of the publicly franking credit refunds received financial planners will shovel more of their clients into being overweight Aussie equities at the top of the market. Aussie retail investors and SMSFs are massively overweight Aus stocks

60 2019-05-21 23:36:27 So instead of keep giving cheap money to the banks & VIP to buy back their stocks, you think it better to just give the people straight out cash or really workable loans, sounds silly but at least it will stimulate the real economy as nothing they done had worked.

74 2019-05-21 23:27:25 @mhmp24  Running low on reserves.  Looks cheap EV/FCF but look for articles on capital expenditures required to replenish reserves, and corruption.  I thought it was one of the few cheap oil stocks, but have to do the above reading.
75 2019-05-21 23:26:47 Or just buy an index fund. Doing the homework on individual stocks is a full-time job and labor intensive

81 2019-05-21 23:24:46 Well, they are technically assets, to be fair. They are digital tokens that can represent value. The value could be stored, transmitted, invested, etc.  Plus, the tokens can represent stocks, titles, and numerous other types of assets, not just currencies.
82 2019-05-21 23:24:08 Hey OTC Marijuana Stocks(@OtcMJStocks19), thank you for following me
83 2019-05-21 23:23:47 Right. I should have been more clear. I understand why people have been skeptical about the stock price over the last few years (true for nearly all stocks when considering historical P/E vs. today's) or those motivated by exactly what you described above.

101 2019-05-21 22:58:56 I think it is the perfect situation for individual stocks, barring any broadbase collapse. If you look at $PHEN, $POPI, $CLI, $GSMI, those are not a group of second or third liners but a set of stocks with great earnings or special stories with good charts.
102 2019-05-21 22:57:49 For alan and jesse. Just remembering that I’m a medical doctor e I’m here for learning. So, if we have a bubble running, should we sell all stocks??reduce?? Hard decisions....here from Brazil, when I see EWZ, it looks cheap and far from a bubble!!
103 2019-05-21 22:57:44 I can remember when the economy was really good. Like now unemployment was low and stocks were high. But we didn't have at will employment, job sharing, blue collar independent contractors, busted unions... You get the idea. #TuesdayThoughts #Capitalism

109 2019-05-21 22:53:52 We would see the “price” of homes decline, cars, food etc. if in fact they were hoarding $. Instead we see the price of assets increasing, such as stocks bonds and real estate. This is a representation of the 3 trillion M1 units created after 08’. Hence the growing wealth gap.
110 2019-05-21 22:52:54 Everything is going wrong at work, and at this point I just want to make it to June 8th so I can sell my stocks and get rid of the rest of my debt and then throw myself at all the companies looking to poach workers from my employer.
111 2019-05-21 22:50:38 According to my rough calculations, 1088 out of 2211 #ASX listed stocks are required to report quarterly cashflows, no relief from ASIC. That's 49%. Does that sound about right?
112 2019-05-21 22:50:34 I never came up with the 40 billion in stocks, it’s a figure reported by various news outlets as the church owns ‘Intellectual Reserve LLC’ and it is possible to track businesses associated with it making more than 100 million USD per year. That’s how the experts found the figure

133 2019-05-21 22:38:15 USD hoarding and reinvesting in US financial assets - stocks and bonds. This will end when the Fed has to reliquify the system
134 2019-05-21 22:37:14 The EU has quotas on NZ lamb & will put quotas on our lamb, but we will still export it, we export 100000 tonnes a year & just agreed to sell more to Japan even after we leave, unless we significantly increase domestic lamb stocks, that's increase is coming from domestic stock
135 2019-05-21 22:36:46 Once the "externalities" of climate breakdown, loss of biodiversity, air pollution, soil compaction/erosion, water pollution + the burden of chronic diseases are taken into account (it's starting to happen), meat & dairy won't be value for money anymore.

141 2019-05-21 22:32:29 something that y’all know but don’t put no thought into is that when you open a savings account , how do ya think it’s building interest ... ? banks invest your money into stocks , the market , companies etc & keep a 70/30 profit (more like 80/20) but feel me-
142 2019-05-21 22:31:18 Yeah but this was only a recent feature , before there was spreads on all stocks.

145 2019-05-21 22:29:26 @Tesco - is it possible to check if the Duke Street, Edinburgh store stocks @Edinburgh_Gin 5cl miniatures? 
146 2019-05-21 22:28:32 That’s funny because @RossTuckerNFL told them to “stick to stocks”. Doesn’t sound like he agrees Matt. I know that’s allowed. Just thought your two tweets were literally within a three tweets on my timeline
147 2019-05-21 22:27:25 Not news, they always said this. Does not mean they are prepared to nest ANY of the substantive US demands. Of course, algos have been programmed by idiots so stocks will rally.

169 2019-05-21 22:08:53 Meat and dairy are far more nutrient dense, are complete proteins and offer value for money. Unlike the alternatives. For example...I'd far rather eat 4ozs of beef to get the protein it contains than munch my way through 6ozs of or... 126 hazelnuts to get the same.
170 2019-05-21 22:08:14 I'm sorry but I do not believe I am 'to blame' for anything & unfortunately you're just furthering the narrative that Leave voters should be in stocks in village squares.

202 2019-05-21 21:38:33 These actions aren’t immoral? And no it shouldn’t be about money. The economy has been booming for nearly 10 years. Unemployment has been down, stocks have been up long before Trump. And $240 makes Trump great?

221 2019-05-21 21:22:58 My worst sin  is that when a trade is going very well, I start thinking that it's going to be even bigger. I don't exit either for profit or loss as well as I do on other stocks.  It's weird, my biggest losses are usually in stocks that were my biggest winners on paper.

I’d like to see all your tax returns to know how much you got paid off by insurance CO’s and which of their stocks you bought!
276 2019-05-21 20:51:20 You are the only place that I can get information about my portfolio without having to do any setup, because I actually buy the stocks on your platform. You remember everything about that.

Use that fact to your advantage. 
Make it easy for me to see that exclusive information.

284 2019-05-21 20:45:34 You chose to spend a lot of space on a generic market index overview, that was much better spent creating some space for the main attraction: Your stocks in your portfolio.

Listening to oldschool investors shouting “cram more into this interface!” will not get you what you want.
285 2019-05-21 20:43:40 Reminds me of how my local hobby store stocks old model kits and they an old TWA 737 kit. I should go back and pick it up. They also had a DC-3.

Pretty good idea because it starts a lot of discussions about life apart and who deserves what tho. Custody can be decided too.

328 2019-05-21 20:22:50 Funny that ARK's $4000 price target was not "noise".  The $10 case is a possible scenario. Elon pleged too many shares. Tesla market cap fell from 50 to $35bn. So Elon with 20% lost ~$3bn. If he gets a margin call then millions of stocks will be sold which could cause a collapse
329 2019-05-21 20:21:54 Heard of stock buybacks? Your stocks don't necessarily soar because you did something that creates or adds value.

341 2019-05-21 20:16:40 See I think technical analysis really isn’t too hard 

For me it’s more psychological, dealing with adversity, volatility (and the lack of), stress, rules and discipline

346 2019-05-21 20:14:10 Of course, but you are missing the point that the client views holding certain individual stocks as less risk-averse than the SP500, mostly because they are long-term shareholders and have held them through previous bear markets with success. Prior behavior has been reinforced.

407 2019-05-21 19:43:27 No argument there.  In my main personal account I went levered long in March 2009 (primarily US) stocks & gold (& then farmland).  Other than farmland, I have remained that way ever since.  By 2014, the trade had allowed me to walk away from my job to start FFTT.

1.Hesitant retail become more bullish stocks and finally unload their bonds. 
2. Pundits think then we blow off to upside while bonds fall. Uh - Uh.  
3. Bonds falling impact corporate debt.  Buybacks funded by this  stop.  

Result? Stocks fall.

449 2019-05-21 19:15:57 I think they will do this kind of mass testing. They are just behind.

For the record, I don’t own Tesla, or any other individual stocks. Takes too much time to follow market, industry, sector, company risk.  I just call em like I see em.  There is big potential upside/downside.
450 2019-05-21 19:15:27 Not trying to be confrontational- but think about this parallel. Lakers and Giants both enjoyed a lot of success on the backs of franchise icons. Both overpaid their icons in the interest of sentimentality and both franchises have turned to laughing stocks consequently

458 2019-05-21 19:10:43 The most crowded trade isn't stocks.  It's government and corporate debt.  

Like Druckenmiller,  I'd rather eat glass than invest in debt,  so much of which is actually negative yielding,  real or even nominal.

472 2019-05-21 19:01:54 most stocks trade with indices and when indices are range bound, so are they.  sometimes though you have a stock that is dancing to its own tune, with a v high base. we make exceptions for those, hence ROKU the only breakout alert from last night's newsletter

484 2019-05-21 18:56:35 Nope. Assuming a diversified portfolio, this would yield a better return than stocks (perhaps 3-4x) over 10 years,  but since you’ve advocated only investing 5-10% of ones net worth, it wouldn’t radically change things. That said, im an advocate of making this available to all

521 2019-05-21 18:39:21 When you invest in the stocks of a company, you enjoy dividend from the company’s profit and when the value of the stock increases, you can decide to sell off some of your stocks and get a return on your investment.

527 2019-05-21 18:37:50 Agree with you Josh, but the original individual highlighted $JNJ. Yes, the list might be small, but a few of these stocks are hiding in plain sight.  Of course, the premier counterexample is $GE, one the darling of the buy and hold forever theory.

541 2019-05-21 18:31:53 I use the inverse ones as a hedge. Works well instead of picking which stocks to sell and then which and when to buy back in. What's your issue with that?

551 2019-05-21 18:28:47 I've paused for the past two months given my obligations. Now I am back in the saddle. Which companies are key options? I'm pissed at myself. When I left January, JSE was at $10  and it's around $19. I had made a request for more stocks, but none was available. I did not followup
552 2019-05-21 18:28:47 Incredibly short sighted, irresponsible.  I’m looking forward to the day normalcy returns to interest rates, which admittedly could be a very long wait.  As Buffett says, if rates are 10 years from now what they are today, stocks are ridiculously cheap.
553 2019-05-21 18:27:12 Millennials want to invest in stocks but there's a lot of friction so they default to Bitcoin which eventually opens the doors to every other project.

This has been my experience with my nephew anyway.  The retention rate to learn after getting their first coin is very high.

575 2019-05-21 18:18:28 FFS, we have to stop using the word 'ico' as well.

The term is misleading, as will be any other 3 letter acronym that rhymes with IPO. These are categorically & fundamentally different than stocks, and we must discontinue the use of terms from that field, including 'market cap'.

581 2019-05-21 18:16:02 What determines when inflation is bullish for equities (I.e. flight to safety/appreciation on stocks maintains purchasing power of currency) vs. bearish for equities (labor/input costs eroded profit margins and compresses multiples)?

638 2019-05-21 17:45:47 10 insiders in the last 2 months sold 40% to 100% of their stocks + stocks/options at prices up to $82.

639 2019-05-21 17:44:44 Not sure I understand your question. My point is simple: when stocks go down, the rally in bonds have become increasingly bigger since 1981, which means they provide progressively better hedging.  I was focusing on 10-year bonds. Havent checked the intermediate term.

657 2019-05-21 17:34:36 If any ( HD, LOW) these stocks should sink 10 to 15% when they import building materials from China.
658 2019-05-21 17:34:34 Playing tricky game with investors is not fun! Tweeting about your upside while knowing your downside is not fun!

The stock plunged dramatically! 
Other US stocks will plunge dramatically ,eventually!

662 2019-05-21 17:32:40 What is he doing to minorities because if I’m not mistaken job growth for us is at an all time high rn. And there was a time when we as Americans weren’t laughing stocks on the world stage like under Obama we had been a international powerhouse and we are now back at the top
663 2019-05-21 17:31:05 Next headline I’m waiting for: “the stock market wouldn’t exist without stocks.”
664 2019-05-21 17:31:02 If people were just buy and hold investors, then the world would be very simple. Put money into stocks and go to sleep. No need to 60/40, rebalancing etc.
665 2019-05-21 17:30:59 I believe @CastleManiaRyan stocks the one Mike Chi himself recommends.  They're cheap too!  I'd give those a try.
666 2019-05-21 17:30:32 Down in HEAVY volume. Stocks up in price, far LESS volume.
667 2019-05-21 17:30:30 Right now, I'm looking for stocks to rally strongly into week's end.  Let's wait and see.  As for $Copper, I think we'll see it carve out a bottom the next little while and then turn up in June.
668 2019-05-21 17:29:53 My Disney stocks thank you.
669 2019-05-21 17:29:32 Don’t teach it. It will never be used or utilized. We teach our kids too many skills they will never use and don’t teach them skills they will need to utilize every single day.

672 2019-05-21 17:28:24 thought it was in response to another tweet re the anticipated ramp in global throughput?  You mentioned US was ok re supply b/c anticipated ramp was less than build in US stocks?  In any case, thanks for prompt reply.
673 2019-05-21 17:28:15 Yellen (former Head of FOMC) says Fed purchases of stocks, corporate bonds could help in next downturn...it appears the Japan playbook is the way forward for most central banks.  buy until you own everything..

679 2019-05-21 17:23:57 Just a matter of time before I can wash my hands of these two stocks in Pennyland. Nothing but stress and BS dealing in this space. Grown men acting like children is a waste of a fucking life.

685 2019-05-21 17:22:05 @anasalhajji for someone that didn't circle back in time, would you please repost your recent comment re build in US crude stocks vs expected 5M ramp in global throughput?  Searched your feed but couldn't find.  Many thanks for this and all of your insights.
686 2019-05-21 17:22:04 So are you saying that A. The index could trade down to individual stocks ? Or B. Stocks could trade up to the index?
687 2019-05-21 17:21:45 Get it! I’ve been watching bitcoin for so long now but too hesitant to jump in on the action. Nothing but stocks up to this point.

Buying falling stocks is called contrarian strategy if balance sheet is strong. Which is completely different from over leveraged & Promoter pledged company.
689 2019-05-21 17:21:08 I was discussing the UK as a whole, not Scotland as we aren't independent yet. As for the CFP, it has saved fishing stocks from being destroyed thanks to quotas stopping overfishing. Again, the Tories were involved in the CFP's inception, agreeing the terms.
690 2019-05-21 17:21:08 i think 12:30 ET is when you see some action. stocks start moving

697 2019-05-21 17:17:00 We didn't even need stocks to rally to see selling in the rates markets.  Since Sunday night its been a slow grind lower in Eurodollars as the FED minutes approach, were  going to see a lot of the word "patience" 
People going to eventually understand that means no Fed hikes/cuts
698 2019-05-21 17:15:34 JPM, per article: “fundamental discretionary traders” account for only about 10 percent of trading volume in stocks. Passive and quantitative investing accounts for about 60 percent, more than double the share a decade ago."

705 2019-05-21 17:12:14 Es algo mucho más complicado que solo creer que un teléfono es mejor que otro. La compañía ha subido super rápido en cuanto a tecnología e innovación mientras Apple pierde stocks y va de caída. Trump es super nacionalista. Conecta los puntos, piénsalo.
706 2019-05-21 17:11:38 were these indices there since 2006 or you plotted it by considering the stock price of the stocks presently forming those index
707 2019-05-21 17:11:32 With diminishing natural stocks & inadequate protections farming may be humanities future. 60% of US salmon sold is farmed in Chile.

710 2019-05-21 17:10:51 $SPY needs to break this range trading. Is being difficult to swing trade in this kind of market. Everyday  trading is a big harder in the Large Caps due this lack of direction. Just Range Trading.

714 2019-05-21 17:09:58 It is all about how you manage your risk.  For me it has created a short term break out, giving a natural level to stop against. And I like stocks that are making new highs

721 2019-05-21 17:06:18 Agree. Far too many people got bulled up on trade talk posturing. FED won’t cut to add more juice to stocks given where they are. Also think same applies to ECB. Cuts being priced now in Jan 2020 is wrong given too many against Tiering it the depo rate and cant cut without that.
722 2019-05-21 17:05:55 Legalization is a disaster in Canada. Companies losing Billions. Stocks going to zero bro. Complete Ponzi scheme man, nobody buying crappy True Dope weed bro.
723 2019-05-21 17:05:33 The $SPY couldn't break the 287 resistance in the morning, pulled back and not is getting close again. If this level breaks we should see move to maybe 290-291 levels.

724 2019-05-21 17:05:27 The same effect happens! It's just rarely noticeable, since big stocks with big option OI don't have that OI concentrated in OTM calls.

728 2019-05-21 17:03:32 Given the looming Memorial Day weekend, I think 13 handle on $VIX is very probably .. and $ES is likely to finish the week in 2880-2900 area.. though i think this would cap corrective bounce.. and June tends to be one of the tougher months for stocks $SPY

730 2019-05-21 17:01:41 To Better Understand Political Interest?

Financial Interest:
Capital Interest; Invested Money (Stocks, Land, PACs...)
Financial Interest; Invested Service (Wall & K Street...)
Vested Interest; U$A @GOP RICO (Graft, Kickbacks...)

Interest pays U$ @GOP to shut-up & shutdown US.
731 2019-05-21 17:01:31 Is this the equivalent of us tweeting things like “YOU SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT APPLE ALREADY. OR BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY. OR OTHER GOOD STOCKS.”
732 2019-05-21 17:01:29 I've noticed that this is often the case for momentum stocks after Day 1 - it takes a much more convincing setup for these.
