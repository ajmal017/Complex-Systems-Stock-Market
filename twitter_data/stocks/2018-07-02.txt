9 2018-07-02 23:51:44 @T_OConnell how do you start looking at stocks and dive into fundamentals? You always find stuff no one is looking at. Been following volume myself for stocks in play but its all technical. Want to find stuff before the crowd.
10 2018-07-02 23:51:40 I was them I would sell 200MMbl of the stocks raise production. This way if prices do go down can refill tanks at others expense. 
Haven't thought too much about this. My timeframe this this year and 6 more months max if it looks safe.

40 2018-07-02 23:44:45 Sure, but i guess I'm suggesting the market has a poor history of effectively forecasting the cash flows from these 'lottery' stocks
41 2018-07-02 23:43:24 Can't help to wonder if the prices for SP are high Cash goes the same route as 2015 and brings up Sheffield in Aug, you have to figure the PO rotation if all are healthy is Sevy Tanaka and CC...maybe he stocks up and gets 1 or 2 pen arms
42 2018-07-02 23:42:36 Thats why I learned to preserve and sell the earth, like weed stocks

46 2018-07-02 23:40:28 Okay seriously @woolworths please get it together. Deliver more gluten free bread to your stores. Every time I have gone in the last two months you’ve either had 1 loaf left, or none at all. No where else near me stocks it. I’m getting sick of this.
47 2018-07-02 23:39:42 #Stocks,#Indexes SPX,NDX bottom signals this a.m., indicating a limited rally, did not warrant short covering. Rally probably to continue, may exceed highs of prior 2 rallies (SPX: 2740-2741).

50 2018-07-02 23:36:53 Paying attention. David and his friends are fighting to ban assault rifles & bump stocks. They want universal background checks and raise the min age to 21 to buy a gun. They support the second amendment and admit that their own homes have guns.
51 2018-07-02 23:35:04 Perma do you have any idea why energy stocks have lagged WTI so badly?  WTI at  4 year highs and these stocks have not come close to recovering. Maybe accumulation until the next leg up?
52 2018-07-02 23:33:18 Honestly just wanna go back to being on stocks with lowpros
53 2018-07-02 23:32:55 It will all depend on your account size and risk you are willing to take. I always have some position or the other in my swing account. I have a few active ones too. TWTR NFLX are some w/hedge. If new to trading, common a.k.a stocks best with smaller size.
54 2018-07-02 23:31:24 Do you recommend options or stocks?  Do you have any outstanding position s?
55 2018-07-02 23:31:14 Does this mean most companies don't have attractive organic investments; therefore, paying stockholders in cash or with current volitity and strong upward market trends, managers think stocks will continue to move up?
56 2018-07-02 23:30:02 The right stocks, and the right guidance.
57 2018-07-02 23:28:38 I’m a small business owner. My taxes are increasing. Not to mention the only reason the DOW is staying afloat at all is because companies are buying their own stocks
58 2018-07-02 23:26:38 What's your view Chris? Things seem to be under a bit of pressure in China but they always seems to muddle their way through. Trade tariffs haven't been that bad yet but stocks are declining a decent amount
59 2018-07-02 23:26:35 You can’t talk bout Gms. Yours did ONE thing and even at that your other one made y’all one of the laughing stocks of the NBA. So yeah...
60 2018-07-02 23:26:31 it'll pop again when the MM's are done shaking people out and are ready to do so. they control all of these OTC stocks don't matter the news, the SS or how great the company is. I think it'll hit .0011-.0014 again. i'll be selling when it does.
61 2018-07-02 23:24:15 Even in mature markets like stocks there are other factors like news and economics that affect the trends and the "technicals" can say anything (it's a parameter to watch though) but if the sentiment changes to positive could be a reverse any time

64 2018-07-02 23:18:46 I guarantee he's paying more taxes.  He has to pay tax on his salary - which he donates back to the government.   And he's not making money off his businesses anymore.  All that's left is whatever stocks/bonds he was allowed to keep.

68 2018-07-02 23:14:39 Thank you for posting that, you show that you didn't even read the article, it says that he shorted the stocks before entering office to avoid conflict of interest that would sway his job, if anything it's more ethical to short them than to keep them while at the job.

71 2018-07-02 23:12:09 Do they have stocks in this show or something? Cause this is a little much.
72 2018-07-02 23:11:31 One reason why the '80s and '90s were so friendly to the momentum player was a thriving IPO market, which we have not seen over the last 20 yrs. We are now (see prior post).  #stocks #IPO
73 2018-07-02 23:11:09 Presumably their stocks would take a hit at minimum.

78 2018-07-02 23:07:54 I knew @Jakedrum had forgotten something! 
79 2018-07-02 23:05:49 I agree abt statistical vs layman definition, often blurred in political debates. Though the statistical definition is more appropriate for policy purposes: you can act on flows, much less on stocks.

81 2018-07-02 23:04:16 I just checked my superannuation account and realised that stocks I bought (and then proceeded to forget about) have appreciated a LOT so i guess good job past me for making good investing decisions
82 2018-07-02 23:03:47 Also. Stocks went up after the massive corporate tax cuts because corporations were using their windfall for buybacks. 

Short sell a stock. He then attacks the company on Twitter. Stock drops like a rock. Cover your short sale. Rinse and Repeat. Lots of insider trading.

127 2018-07-02 22:34:08 I just took a look at automotive parts stocks and the news is grim. They've all been taking a beating since the week of June 11-18. Those tariffs -- real and threatened -- are actively beating down US businesses right now.
128 2018-07-02 22:33:55 Looking at the other images, it would seem the order was:

You have no pictures from the trial, because theydidn't allow pictures to be taken in the courtroom.
129 2018-07-02 22:33:36 She was never a journalist.  She played one on TV.  Became famous as an enthusiastic shill for internet stocks who was good looking.  Still better than Lou Dobbs I suppose. And not making policy ala Kudlow.

Don't make things illegal just tax the hell out of it & let the free market decide if its still worth the investment
Also tax stock trades & churches
QUIT raising taxes on less than 6 figure incomes!
131 2018-07-02 22:30:56 There is a bad "punny" joke here about @jaysonstreet view of 'old world finance' in "stocks" and "bond"-age requiring too much "discipline"

145 2018-07-02 22:20:59 The unemployment rate went down 1% point in the last year-and-a-half but wages are stagnant. Wages should be rising because we are at almost full employment but it isn't because Donald and the Republicans gave corporations trillions of dollars that they used to buy back stocks.
146 2018-07-02 22:19:56 When I first was exposed to Wall St in the '60's stockbrokers, which is essentially what this guy is, were with exceptions not particularly knowledgeable. They were salesman, could have been selling cars as easily as stocks.
147 2018-07-02 22:19:38 Cuttings are dead easy from lavender and rosemary... next year they'll be beautiful.

152 2018-07-02 22:17:37 Yes, I had a few PLUS/ISDX stocks back in the day. SPRP, IDEA & OMIP all eventually listed on AIM & thankfully all were multi-baggers. Not adverse to investing in this pool...but haven’t for a while now.

184 2018-07-02 21:54:53 He really is quite bad. Terrible. 2000+ children still imprisoned. Tax cuts that only rich can enjoy. The deficit ballooning. Stocks flatlined. And lies and lies. Like NK is not a threat. Lol.
185 2018-07-02 21:53:12 The law to ban bump stocks.  The oversize magazine law ban as well.  They are currently working to dismantle the background checks
186 2018-07-02 21:53:10 2000+ still not reunited with families. Puerto Rico is still not taken care of after Hurricane. Tax cuts allowed companies to buy back $189 BILLION in stocks. No wage increases.

191 2018-07-02 21:49:21 The money a beginner loses in stocks is worth every penny!

Take that as the ‘tuition fee’ one has to pay to become a better investor.

The earlier we pay this ‘fee’ the better as our stakes are trivial relative to the learning and experience that would last a lifetime!
192 2018-07-02 21:47:27 @SteveGrassoCNBC biotech biotech anyone?  Do you guys ever talk about celgene gilead great stocks that have nothing to do with trade and have been bull flagging ??????????
193 2018-07-02 21:44:38 I think our schools fail horribly at financial education.

You're right: I learned from my parents, and I started talking about stocks, real estate, taxes etc with my kids when they were toddlers.

201 2018-07-02 21:39:40 Absolutely agree Bull!  A lot of traders/investors forget that many other types of investors out there that don't buy individual company stocks. For them, ETF's are lower risk way to play a sector. We can expect $URA to move substantially higher as there's no other ETF choice!
202 2018-07-02 21:39:07 Both can’t shoot 
203 2018-07-02 21:38:35 Will rondo start over ball ?
204 2018-07-02 21:38:02 I agree. I need to know what I am buying and why, trade plan is always key. Too many traders chasing stocks, but they won't know how to adapt when markets change. Need to have an edge imo and not buy randomly. When traders ask "what do you think of this stock?" that's a problem.
205 2018-07-02 21:37:02 My greed has lowered and I’m here to support my amazing girlfriend, son, and a new born on the way.

Forget getting rich, just live.

281 2018-07-02 20:50:14 True. Real estate is not liquid. But you can mortgage or rent to have cash flow that you can use for charity. 

Stocks —you will have to trade or sell to realize the gain. But you receive dividends that you can encash to also use for charity. Or if the profit is too big, sell.

290 2018-07-02 20:44:18 If $URA was to rally higher then Global X would'nt need to keep selling #uranium equities.

Hi there brother. What do you think of $RDVT? Thanks!
298 2018-07-02 20:39:10 $FCSC is worth at least 100M. VERY under-valued gene therapy, considering their interim pI/II data (at least as good as $ABEO on DEB), expertise in fibroblast cells, and lenti vector constructor with on/off switch. I hold both stocks. It looks to me $FCSC could triple anytime.
299 2018-07-02 20:39:02 This is good to know re:Trump’s Commerce Sec’y: (CNBC): “Wilbur Ross says he shorted two MORE stocks during his time as Commerce secretary.. Ross said all of trades were approved, AFTER  he executed them, by the Commerce Department’s office of ethics and compliance.” OK..sure
300 2018-07-02 20:38:22 $KZR $AVRO $PTGX $MGTA.  These are some biotech stocks (incl. IPOs) hedge funds acquired 5%+ ownership lately. $PTGX is a more interesting new buy made by Jeffrey Jay after the company's negative clinic trial data. Jay acquired a stake worth ~1.55% p.w., not insignificant amount.

Defense stocks is where you can cash it out lol
308 2018-07-02 20:34:03 If I believed in market manipulation, I'd say shorts deliberately trading down $URA on small volume in order to ensure Global X keeps pushing down #uranium equities on which they hold large short positions. A falling $URA also forces ETF unit redemption, pushing U stocks down.
309 2018-07-02 20:32:28 How exactly is #bitcoin immune to this? I agree in BTC's differentiation, but it has existed solely in 10 years of unprecendeted credit expansion alongside cash-burning tech stocks. Only the diehard few view BTC as a safe haven, the rest view it as the ultimate speculative asset.
310 2018-07-02 20:32:16 oh, yeah, Wedbush is notoriously wrong. And worse, the lady analyst tries hard to cover so many bio stocks.

321 2018-07-02 20:24:45 Gearing has nothing to do with a stocks share price.
Stock prices are not reflected on a companies Balance Sheet.
Though agree share buy backs do effect gearing ratios.
Companies with high debt, costs will rise in any downturn, depending on terms of loans - fixed or variable.

392 2018-07-02 19:44:57 @7777LYN7777 I need to get some understanding on some of these small "penny" stocks.  Years ago Healthsouth was basically a penny stock (2004?) and then boom!

The stocks of the two biggest private prison operators -- CoreCivic (formerly know as Corrections Corp. of America) and Geo Group -- have doubled since election day. CoreCivic (CXW) is up 140% since Trump won in November; Geo Group (GEO) has risen 98%.
400 2018-07-02 19:41:29 CEO pay tied to stock prices. Companies buy back billions in stocks to keep prices high, driving almost all of the stock market rise. What could go wrong?

407 2018-07-02 19:37:48 I honestly really like @RobinhoodApp. I buy some stocks and REITs through it also but it’s dissapointing they don’t offer #Litecoin and some other coins. They’re losing a lot of money/business by not adding #LTC.
408 2018-07-02 19:37:12 I hope they overturn the ban on machine guns made after 1986 because even before that, there were no crimes committed with legally possessed machine guns because they were already highly regulated.  That pointless law created bump stocks. Gun Owners of America is against it.

415 2018-07-02 19:35:51 Part of the reason stocks are chaotic is because they are affected by predictions about themselves. Someone says "This will improve" and that has an effect on the stock market.

417 2018-07-02 19:35:18 Starting today the FED balance sheet starts shrinking by 50B/mo up from 30B last quarter. The reversal of what drove stocks up should now drive them down. This should be an interesting quarter. Watch out below on Nasdaq 100 and Russell 2K

433 2018-07-02 19:25:58 Hi I’m Jonathan and I’m tempted to buy stocks after a sharp drop.

A falling knife or a value find. Only a highly selective time period will tell.

437 2018-07-02 19:24:50 Trump's commerce secretary said Trump won't change his trade policy even if the stock market keeps falling. "There's no bright line level of the stock market that's going to change policy," Wilbur Ross said. Stocks slipped lower during the first trading day of the third quarter
438 2018-07-02 19:23:10 Wow, that $SDRL is scammy. stocks don't seem to move on news unless it's in after hours. No move for $SENS on FDA apprv either. Trade the chart, not the news. I got in and out flat on $SDRL - scam!

440 2018-07-02 19:21:39 Agreed, effective management when trading volatile bs stocks like Tesla will occasionally see positions being stopped out, from both the long and short side. There seems to be a narrative that shorts never take profits, in it for the 'Lehman' trade, and always get squeezed. wtf!

443 2018-07-02 19:20:35 The Habs are one of the premier laughing stocks of the league. Management has no direction and top players don’t want to play there because of their rude fans and obnoxious media. Teams will wait patiently until MB makes another blunder. It’s actually quite comical.
444 2018-07-02 19:20:02 Agreed. Paying attention to warning signs & violent threats are the way to move forward from this incident. I was also saying that although I am pro gun control, the Cap Gazette shootings do not fit the typical gun control arguments (high caliber weapons, bump stocks, etc).
445 2018-07-02 19:18:42 Upper-class people don't buy cheap stocks. Why? Because they are too wise
446 2018-07-02 19:18:21 @Xiphos_Trading I was hoping cryptos would crash without help from stocks, but that ship may have sailed.  The bloodbath in Asian stock markets, especially China, is not good for Bitcoin...less money looking to bypass capital controls.
447 2018-07-02 19:17:54 Acts 22/20 have their pros and cons.  AFAIK, the tax is not really $0.  It is only that for income sourced solely from Puerto Rico.  So if you invest in stocks outside of the island, IRS still gets their cut.
448 2018-07-02 19:17:39 Trump has the ability to drive the stock market up , or down .... is he and his buddies [Wilbur Ross, et al ] buying and selling stocks with foreknowledge of which way Trump will drive the market ... if so, he and his boys are way worse than Keating, Skillings,and  Kenneth Lay ..

Have you ever ever ever seen a person much less the POTUS be so needy and crave adoration?  How many times has he said “they weren’t nice to me”? Kids talk like this, not presidents.
493 2018-07-02 18:56:21 143 Likes enjoy losing Money in Falling Stocks more often these days. Trump fails to take credit for that even though his FART trade policies are the cause.

532 2018-07-02 18:33:19 Agreed. Many other factors in the cause column. Acres, good growing start, large stocks, etc. 

This is as good an example as ever why COT is important to follow. 

Probably the least attention getting yet major price mover in the market.

535 2018-07-02 18:32:25 Once you trade for a while you’ll start to just feel it and you’ll notice a seasonality/pattern to the market and also to individual stocks. Of course, it’s still impossible to always time the bottom or top, but you won’t need to make good money.

548 2018-07-02 18:18:25 The so sought after institutionalization will be great for the initial pump and its aftershocks. Yet the more institutionalized crypto becomes, the harder it will be to trade. Eventually would expect little difference between crypto and stocks. Can't say when.

584 2018-07-02 17:52:35 yeah and that is not completely off base - ISM and SPX do tend to stay fairly in step - but it is clear to me that stocks can be driven more by liquidity than growth for long enough to make or lose real money

750 2018-07-02 16:08:56 @HalftimeReport The S&P 500 was up 1.7% in first half so to say a small group of stocks made up 84% of the move is really meaningless.  If the first half was up 10-15% then such a stat would be meaningful.

Current market climate isn’t a huge concern for me. I’m a far out swig trader. I occasionally do short term scalps but definitely not
847 2018-07-02 15:19:10 I think it was papa Kennedy who said, “When my shoeshine guy was advising me in stocks, I saw an overinflated market”.

1277 2018-07-02 11:03:56 Whenever there is uncertainty in the market, volatility tends to increase. This will also give opportunity in short-term to gain from mispricing as stocks which were richly priced are now available at a reasonable value.

1308 2018-07-02 10:29:38 One ‘interesting’ point - there is no such thing as a Stocks & Shares LISA or Cash LISA in HMRC’s rules, just a LISA. The difference between LISA & ISA in this regard is causing problems for some savers who think they can save into one of each type, when the ‘types’ don’t exist.

1327 2018-07-02 10:08:06 The comparison is not between delivery and intraday trading in stocks, but between intraday trading in stocks and trading F&O.
1328 2018-07-02 10:07:30 Canadian financial markets closed Monday. TSX gained 5.92% in the second quarter. Dow Jones Average rose just 0.7% but tech stocks in demand: Nasdaq gained 6.33% in Q2. U.S. stock index futures down significantly this morning.
1329 2018-07-02 10:05:55 Stock price can't compound more than earnings growth forever because PE is not going to be re rated forever. Quality stocks (50+ FMCG basket) will underperform compared to earnings in next decade.
1330 2018-07-02 10:04:34 Stocks Tumble on Trade Worries and German Political Uncertainty
1331 2018-07-02 10:04:11 STT on sell side for Intraday is 0.025% whereas for delivery trades it is 0.125℅. So STT is lower for trading in stocks intraday.

1368 2018-07-02 09:28:49 Global asset price inflation has now increased the amount to US$228 trillion at constant prices. Global real estate is a more valuable asset class than all stocks, shares and securitised debt combined – which, together amount to just US$170 trillion. - Savills 2017
1369 2018-07-02 09:28:35 And yes, US has the richest in the world but that's mainly because of capital wealth and when the largest -by far- corporations are in the US, is a natural outcome.

1522 2018-07-02 07:08:12 Yes, investors denominated in USD and with a home bias for US stocks had a great run. However, for many, 36 months ago was pretty much the top!

1523 2018-07-02 07:07:22 But you are correct, "no excuse for this", just like there is "no excuses" for your lame "no commitment" to outlaw Bump Stocks.  THERE IS ALSO NO EXCUSE FOR THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1766 2018-07-02 02:49:54 BTW, we actually did get a parabolic move the last two months--but it was in small-caps, FANGs & growth stocks (peaked on June 20th)--just not in SPX. So in that sense, your forecast has been correct,  just didn't happen in SPX. Was classic narrow blow-off like Q12000 or Q2-2015.

1769 2018-07-02 02:46:43  wow so what do we have here logical fallacy? Post hoc, ergo propter hoc. If you try to blow someone’s head off and miss its okay? Yes the “stock has dropped” and exhibited higher volatility than other stocks that do not pay a dividend. Individual investors likely harmed

1776 2018-07-02 02:42:37 Yes, I do know what semi-automatics are/how they work. You still haven't provided a reasonable thought process as to why bump stocks - which upgrade handguns to shoot at nearly the rate of a machine gun - should be in the hands of civilians. There isn't a good reason.

1792 2018-07-02 02:38:24 They smartened up and shut up. Starbucks isn't doing that, thus, here we are. Seriously, if you think 2 little liberally retarded stocks impact my portfolio you are terribly mistaken.

1793 2018-07-02 02:37:24 ICOs are stocks. function like stocks, live and die as stocks do. Regardless of their marketing.

Agreed, deceptive marketing should be shamed. Targeted shaming 
General shaming requires stright definitions
1794 2018-07-02 02:37:22 Anyone have any advice on what stocks to buy? Lol
1795 2018-07-02 02:36:00 Everyone is excited to talk about individual stocks, value or growth stories, or where the index is heading. But what about asset allocation? It surely has a greater impact on your net worth as compared to individual stocks.

1798 2018-07-02 02:31:38 (2) *HOWEVER, there are three important points.

First, 8% guaranteed for 11 years is A+ (relative to a 60% stocks, 40% bonds portfolio).

Second, interest rates have dropped hard. This makes annuity payments more valuable! At 4%, they are worth 42% more! Excellent.

1810 2018-07-02 02:23:12 According to Oxford Dictionaries:

Speculation means
1. The forming of a theory or conjecture without firm evidence.
2. Investment in stocks, property, etc. in the hope of gain but with the risk of loss.

So, I’ll assume you speculate...a lot.

1812 2018-07-02 02:21:20 I wonder how many story stocks lure in investors who don’t normally invest?

The fuel for stories are investors who disregard financials and invest with a “if they just capture 1% of the market...” mentality.

1836 2018-07-02 01:54:03 The problem with bullish love stories is people never know when to sell. This is the late 90s again when people rode story stocks straight up then straight to the ground.

1841 2018-07-02 01:45:03 How management communicates mistakes is very important. No one is mistake-free -- as investors 40% of the stocks we buy underperform the market -- and I'd be concerned about any company where shareholder communication doesn't include a candid assessment of mistakes -- Bill Nygren
1842 2018-07-02 01:44:10 It’s not uncommon for tracking stocks to trade at discounts of 10% or so to the value of assets they’re linked to. Why? Because they don’t pay dividends, some institutional investors won’t buy them, and they’re just plain weird.

1845 2018-07-02 01:39:01 I despise people who spend their days talking people out of investing for the future. Owning the wrong stocks is far less egregious than constantly predicting doom and pretending gold isn’t just another commodity.
1846 2018-07-02 01:38:22 No he already bragged when they did go up extremely. Just because they go down doesn't mean they were not up. Every on knows that stocks go up and down but never have they gone up as much as they did for @realDonaldTrump

1857 2018-07-02 01:32:10 That is expected when having a weak currency. Who is affected by it? People who have mutual funds. Money market accts, Ppl with CD’s, time deposits, and other type of investments. The upside? Ppl w/ money can buy stocks on the dip, and sell them when it doubles, or triple, etc

1862 2018-07-02 01:28:01 I dont directly trade the spy. Because 3/4 of all stocks follow the spy I keep it at the top of my watch list everyday. Helps me with conviction in my decisions. I look to see if the spy is weak, under tight consolodation or on a breakout/breakdown of key level.

1889 2018-07-02 00:50:49 Crypto excited people because prices were rising. Stocks are pieces of businesses that innovate and grow sales and profits over time—they create real wealth. It’s too early to call this. IMO we haven’t yet seen enough use cases for crypto that create wealth.

1901 2018-07-02 00:39:33 The Cleveland @cavs Stocks just dropped to -600%
1902 2018-07-02 00:37:16 Damn right. Just like trump did coming down the escalator... He paid all those people 50 bucks to be there. Media needs to get a grip on reality instead of having stars in their eyes.

And now we have to ask... Are media owners making big time money shorting stocks???
1903 2018-07-02 00:36:52 The rich are far more likely to own stocks than middle or working-class families. Eighty-nine percent of families with incomes over $100,000 have at least some money in the stock market, compared with just 21 percent of households earning $30,000 or less. ~Forbes
1904 2018-07-02 00:36:43 Not with your poor attempts at trade, economy is already showing signs of dropping, stocks going down. But I guess in your tiny bubble of life experience, that's a good thing?
1905 2018-07-02 00:34:56 Aussie shares off to a positive start to the new financial year. #ASX 200 +12pts or 0.2% to 6207 in early trade. Gains in banks & enrgy stocks offset by weakness in miners & retail #ausbiz

1908 2018-07-02 00:33:39 US stocks rose on Friday led by the energy and materials sectors, even as the earlier gains in financial shares flamed out, although for the week all major benchmarks finished lower due to ongoing trade war-related jitters.
1909 2018-07-02 00:33:23 I agree with @b_m0rt. Everyone will approach the same stocks with yours and Bao's mindset. There will no longer be an edge. The thought process is the edge, how you manage yourself in the trade is also a part of it. You guys are who people working to become a trader look up......
1910 2018-07-02 00:33:14 Yes, it does. Glad you agree. Of course, other measures are required, too. Universal background checks, no bump stocks, no high capacity magazines, red flag laws, etc. But banning the assault rifles is a good start.
1911 2018-07-02 00:27:59 Big baller brand stocks gone right up
1912 2018-07-02 00:26:29 You don't know? Bump stocks were approved by Obama. .
Best gun salesman,  till hogg.
1913 2018-07-02 00:25:55 Surprise, surprise!
What else is anything ever done for?
Parties, events, purposes coallesced under an umbrella called "industrialism",  accords with the times.
Writing (ancient) was invented to track sales, stocks, etc.
Lots more, but no room here. 
Politics + profit =normal.

1915 2018-07-02 00:25:36 Yes I agree mike.  I nibbled in some uranium stocks but not all out bullish yet.  I also like Tesla.  I think a move above 370 is super bullish. Target 475 to 500. It’s been holding up well. Good luck mike. I enjoy the podcasts. My uranium pick is uec and western uranium

1920 2018-07-02 00:21:16 Kinda like everyone predicted stocks plummeting when @realDonaldTrump got elected. Everything is the end of the world with you but jobs. Libs buy hook line and sinker. Be embarrassed, because you’re an embarrassment
1921 2018-07-02 00:20:46 Yes, you will. 
I have also wanted the Bakugo nendo. It’s so adorable! But I was too late I wasn’t able to pre-order him during the release date. No stocks available at the moment. Now I’m crying!

1925 2018-07-02 00:18:22  how was the golf? Get back into town and look around. Shit is hitting the fan. Stocks at ten year low! Your buddy Manafort is about ready to flip. The kids you kidnapped are still missing. Mueller wants to have a sit down as in under oath. Rudy went in to hiding. Hip hop

1930 2018-07-02 00:17:19 @ontheslabs Hey man, I saw that you recorded the @modern_rock recaps. I missed Tuesdays and Thursdays. If it's okay with Rock, do you mind sharing them? Unfortunately I was battling an upper respiratory infection smh
1931 2018-07-02 00:17:08 @chrisbrecher did you not have one with " Simpler stocks"  about a year ago? Did you change the name?
1932 2018-07-02 00:16:52 It’s what Trump intended all along. Inflate to appease his believers, impose tariffs to start the economy spiral, as stocks crash, he/cronies start buying in big companies. Bottom out, remove tariffs. Build back up, own the fucking country. Putin, China and NK get what they want.
1933 2018-07-02 00:16:06 That also has to be a big boost in your solar energy stocks. Just think of all the jet fuel you will be able to buy.
1934 2018-07-02 00:15:38 Cautionary prediction:

In the next 2-4 months there will be large "correction" in stocks/housing market.

The media will over exaggerate it and cause a mild economic scare halting growth just before midterms.

Don't let it fool you, its not the next recession... not yet.
1935 2018-07-02 00:12:24 Canada imposed new retaliatory tariffs today. Watch stocks tomorrow. Already worst 1 half year since 2010. All this winning is making Amerika great.

1941 2018-07-02 00:05:46 Yeah, keep feeding that stereotype about fact and reason impaired right-wingers. You all are laughing stocks as you believe lie after lie coming out of Trump's mouth. God forbid you should try to distinguish yourself. MUTED

1945 2018-07-02 00:03:56 What clueless dweebs these trade officials are. Of course they are led by the dweeb in Chief. These trade wars will not end well. Sell all stocks and buy back in after the crash.
1946 2018-07-02 00:03:16 Let's teach kids about passive income, stocks, mutual funds and taxes. The home buying process is also pretty realavent I would think.
