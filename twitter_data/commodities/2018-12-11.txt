0 2018-12-11 23:55:43 There is a huge difference in having to make difficult choices and take risks in your career, compared to being property though and having "commodities" extracted from tour physical being.
1 2018-12-11 23:53:20 , 2% increase each year in supply (Volcker IMO).

In the 90s lip service was paid to IRT as a tool, while they were keeping one eye on commodities. Same could be said of Yellen.

If you slayed Phillips curve but had to live with IRT, don't know if it's completely terrible.

3 2018-12-11 23:52:34 Why individual fiat currencies and not interestingly denominated baskets of currencies and commodities - I always thought this was the attraction of "stable coins", backed or synthetic.
4 2018-12-11 23:41:08 The price of oil is only about 5% of the global market. And increase in that one commodity causes an exponential increase on all other commodities.
Fuel taxes are devastating to the transportation industry which moves all goods. 
This tax hurts poor people.
5 2018-12-11 23:38:00 For those who keep asking me where i trade legacy market and commodities, here are 2 options (i'm not affiliated to any of those btw):

8 2018-12-11 23:17:55 Theres a trade war and its hitting more traditional commodities like soy beans and maize(corn).Your every day waru is also involved.
9 2018-12-11 23:14:17 Let's hope it's not that quick of a decline lol. But over the last few years we have held on to "hot commodities" only for them to not live up to the hype.
10 2018-12-11 23:07:01 Do you imagine if one day we realized that gold doesn't actually worth "that much", because well, nobody uses it for a real purpose -like oil or other commodities- and then, just like that, ~8 trillion USD were wiped out? 
That would be something amazing to watch.
11 2018-12-11 23:00:21 Agreed. Two proven commodities can’t get paid while the guy who happened to get hot for 1 postseason cashed in?
12 2018-12-11 22:58:36 could be....that's the hard part about putting yourself out there. Your friend probably never traded commodities where all decisions to buy or sell is ultimately on the person one sees in the mirror. Of course you're not idiot. You can be wrong like anyone else. Not on this IMO.
13 2018-12-11 22:55:11 This is what I've been telling people. It is totally worth its "expensive" value if Apple Store is nearby. Even if not, I think Apple Apps, Apple Pages Publisher, Apple Books, etc should be something that people need to use.

Smartphones beyond commodities.
14 2018-12-11 22:43:49 Wrong he dealt in commodities tangible things like metals.
15 2018-12-11 22:40:45 Warehousing?! When those in high levels of government dehumanize real lives to the status of goods or commodities, you can be SURE we are heading in the FAR wrong direction. 2020 or Mueller needs to hurry the hell up!!
16 2018-12-11 22:32:13 No genera rechazo porque se quedan en el PIB, cuando hagan doble click verán que es socialismo XXI = un régimen político totalitario, una economía dependiente de commodities, planificación central, control de precios, excesivo gasto fiscal, mayor presión fiscal y deuda... 
17 2018-12-11 22:30:58 So, our farmers on welfare cuz #tradewar? — Congressional negotiators said they faced increasing pressure to complete the bill from farmers and ranchers who have suffered steep declines in commodities prices amid Trump’s ongoing trade war with China. - wapo
18 2018-12-11 22:30:35 The 40,000 Americans dying of preventable causes every year are exactly as bad off now as they would have been under a Democrat. Same for people in medical bankruptcy.

We are not commodities to be exploited for profit.

We have had ENOUGH!
19 2018-12-11 22:29:48 He's right in the middle of the professional markets (objective) group-think with these comments. I'm bearish property, so also banks, so also the ASX and the latish growth cycle won't see commodities running up hard. So AUD can't run hard especially with no rate rises.
