36 2018-09-06 21:54:01 I should probably expound a little. Collins and Freeman have shown us what they've got. Conner not yet. Ride proven commodities in Week 1.
37 2018-09-06 21:53:51 Kahit na itaas niyo pa ang minimum wage, it will only cost us more.

Instead of increase in wage, we need to work on lowering the commodities. In that way, value of money would be high.
38 2018-09-06 21:51:34 Please can u investigate the cause of shortage of basic commodities ,is it less  confidence by manufacturers in the New Gvt or Sabotage ?
39 2018-09-06 21:50:31 I was a preteen.  Hand plotting commodities on graph paper from the Wall Street Journal every day.  Making my paper trades.

This was almost 40 years ago.

Depressing 'what if' memories that sometimes turn to anger.  I'm not where I'm supposed to be.  I know this much for sure.
40 2018-09-06 21:46:15 Ideology reifies everything that is produced by people themselves & that can be changed through our will. The latest sick twist is the fettishism of people as "brands" ie.commodities

And that's just the beginning. Charcoal is better at steelmaking than coke, just wasn't as cheap. Now add free power.
49 2018-09-06 20:34:01 Yes, stop the swamp.   Fix it by reinstating the rules Clinton repealed.   Repeal Commodities Modernization act.  Reinstate uptick fuled, strengthen antitrust laws, break up these multimedia conglomerate s..s.
50 2018-09-06 20:32:53 In a capitalist society, prices for commodities vary. It is abt brand and profit maximisation. If i can afford expensive salt, surely i will buy it. If not, i will stick to what i can afford. At the end of the day we have choice.

54 2018-09-06 20:11:14 What a shame; truth and honesty seem to be rare commodities today, even for supreme Supreme Court nominees.
55 2018-09-06 20:10:34 If by market fundamentals you mean we are entering a recession and commodities are showing that to be true as they go lower, then I agree. Unfortunately these markets won't be going lower orderly, hence a crisis is coming.
56 2018-09-06 20:06:16 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
57 2018-09-06 20:03:17 Obviamente no hablo de una sucursal bancaria, hablo, por ejemplo, de la mesa de commodities de Londres de Morgan Stanley que ha decidido no operar en el mercado eléctrico español ...
58 2018-09-06 20:03:05 Two of the most precious commodities in the universe are time, and words. Don't waste either. And don't use one to waste the other.
59 2018-09-06 19:58:51 Help the poor in deed,  they made common commodities so high for common n poor man. You are just everywhere saying they are helping with 10k. Can 10k support what? A cup of rice is how much nw even beans n yam. What of doing this 2yrs ago.

64 2018-09-06 19:46:46 Ok sounds good. So far I have read Downward’s Post Keynesian Pricing Theory to just get a start, Fred Lee’s Textbook and 1 blog from NEP, Sraffa’s 1925 article on returns to scale, and the first few chapters of Production of Commodities. By far the hardest for me was Sraffa
65 2018-09-06 19:39:49 volaron commodities (aunque soja pesaba mucho menos que ahora en la balanza comercial) y eso ayudó. Claro que el tipo de cambio fijo no permitió amortiguar el impacto ni aprovechar con más fuerza la salida.
66 2018-09-06 19:33:38 Dec 8130 -41 8207-8122 EQ: 2175-2280 depending on tariff D19 7727 -44. If Dec can't hold above 8050, don't be a surprise see a test if 8030-7980 level. Too many trade/tariff/currency issues to make commodities too attractive in the face of the strong stock market; Dow 26000+.
67 2018-09-06 19:28:07 With all due respect I want the Jubilee government to hike more prices on fuel, milk, maize flour and other commodities. This is because we all said "TUKO PAMOJA" hata kwa Hii bei ya mafuta..,Tuko PAMOJA!

1) Totally uncorrelated asset class traditional mrks. Adding 1% Crypto makes total risk go down. Increases performance. 

2) Almost any increase in demand, causes a rise in price. Unlike traditional commodities supply is limited.

95 2018-09-06 17:43:45 Utility stores are one of the tool in the hand of the government to have control on the prices of Basic commodities. Private stake holders can't make a cartel bcoz of these stores. Prices of basic commodities will increase dramatically if these stores are closed

117 2018-09-06 16:55:24 Mmm?Do you really think they will get full Canadian participation, and if they do, will the climate, which is supposedly going into the Eddie Minimum, which means more ice up there, really allow enough open water time, to ship those commodities? 
I Still think this is an odd deal
118 2018-09-06 16:46:27 Do industry going to open or close ? 
If their going to open , why we experience sky rocketing of basic commodities
119 2018-09-06 16:45:54 As the value of the dollar declines, the dollar price of all commodities will rise and significant price inflation will follow in the United States and elsewhere.

129 2018-09-06 16:20:34 Thanks, just curious. That’s one of my biggest issues w/gold and other physical commodities: actually buying it/them in an efficient manner
130 2018-09-06 16:18:48 Not much of a role

Non-reserve "currencies" may be commodities (e.g. unit of compute) or taxi medallions (e.g. right to work for cash flows), but I don't see them w a SoV role

A world of multi cryptocurrencies assumes a world of isolated crypto economies, which I find unlikely

133 2018-09-06 16:08:01 is a measure of character. For me, the responses by @ChrisLu44, & @ChrisMurphyCT demonstrated a sense of humor about themselves and refreshing candor.  These seem to be commodities that are valuable in every aspect of life, all the more so in politics & politicians where they are
134 2018-09-06 16:05:16 Also NFL teams have shown a history of mistreating current and former players and they take full advantage of players as commodities and sell it to us as “love for the game.” The NBA, and less so the MLB, treat their players way better.
135 2018-09-06 16:03:44 Wheat as well but that is due to drought in Europe and Australia. Basically inelastic commodities have hold their prices well
136 2018-09-06 15:58:40 It certainly could be! I think the known commodities push it to Iowa’s favor for now. ISU has players I think will play well, but I couldn’t consider that for this particular exercise
137 2018-09-06 15:49:10 I support higher tax on fuel and lower tax on commodities .
138 2018-09-06 15:46:53 E o nome disso não é bolha, imbecil. Se chama crise fiscal aprofundada por necessidades de reformas no orçamento público. Tu nem sabe do que tá falando. E bolha? Eu vivi no boom das commodities e na época em que o governo tinha políticas fiscais ortodoxas.
139 2018-09-06 15:46:09 I hear ya. It’s strange to make commodities of things we hold dear. Truly nothing is sacred, and that’s more heartbreaking than finding out Santa isn’t real as a kid.
140 2018-09-06 15:38:45 If only you would exchange lives with one of us and feel the heat out here. Bread in @hwange is now scarce, fuel hikes, basic commodities price high. Is this the new dispensation or good is yet to come. We voted and trust you'll be a true leader. Give it your best good luck.
141 2018-09-06 15:34:36 Anecdotal, but I'm willing to wait for a speciality item. Anything that could be purchased on Amazon, though, especially commodities/consumable...well, why wait, if Prime will deliver in two days (or less)?
142 2018-09-06 15:33:32 Increasing inflation rate, continuously weakening peso, rising prices of prime commodities and basic necessities is an indication that this administration has no sound economic policy.
143 2018-09-06 15:31:54 “Most of us see such an abundance of material commodities around us that scarcity no longer motivates our lives, but at the same time we are groping for direction and asking for meaning and purpose.” Nouwen

146 2018-09-06 15:27:58 It’s just economics (I would know, I participate in this to some degree). Big 5 and IQ are commodities at this point, so if you’re building a business selling something related to them, you have to differentiate on brand.
147 2018-09-06 15:27:03 EIA report killed commodities, $CL_F moved first.
148 2018-09-06 15:26:48 866-9-No-Scam 
Florida State law prohibits extreme increases in the price of essential commodities, such as food, water, hotels, ice, gasoline, lumber and equipment, needed as a direct result of an officially declared emergency.
149 2018-09-06 15:26:25 Bjp should focus on reducing prices of essential commodities

154 2018-09-06 15:11:56 They know they're just commodities. If the team sees no use to them, they'll be shipped off in no time. Better take the future in their hands.

208 2018-09-06 12:56:04 All I'm saying is the US managed to do exactly that (controlling even China) by gaining control of commodities thru the USD; China clearly understands this & is working to do the same.  Once China reaches critical threshold, what people "want" becomes secondary to what they need.
209 2018-09-06 12:55:32 Technically commodities that are charged VAT shouod not increase prices coz of fuel VAT. It's not an additional cost to them but an increase in their input VAT
210 2018-09-06 12:51:31 And btw, if you thought the corruption, unemployment, high taxes and the increased VAT on all commodities is terrible, wait for the inevitable inflation. We are going to pay for the stupidity of the few who wouldn't look past their tribe.

217 2018-09-06 12:35:06 The cause of our country's inflation is due to the massive Goverment spending of this administration. The government is spending more than what the revenue is bringing back, that's why the prices of goods and commodities are rising to stable the scale.

229 2018-09-06 11:51:00 Ramdam ko na yung "Change is coming."
High prices of commodities, pagtaas ng minimum fare (na baka tumaas pa), some govermnent officials focusing on ousting their critics rather than saving our country. 

Wala naman daw kasing sinabing change for better or worse eh. Tsk.
230 2018-09-06 11:48:08 In the European Commodities Markets oil prices fell on Thursday as emerging market woes weighed on sentiment, while a deadline neared for a potential new round of U.S. tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese goods.
231 2018-09-06 11:47:48 Commodities have taken a major hit over the last few months, copper, another closely-watched indicator of economic strength, has lost one-fifth of its value since early June.
232 2018-09-06 11:34:07 Is it 'slowing growth' or more Trump pushing China to the point of capitulation in the trade talks and when China does capitulate commodities, growth snaps back hard, etc. Trump has to make the markets capitulate to appear as though he means it with CHina.
233 2018-09-06 11:33:59 Unfortunately, risk assets and commodities move with the dollar (mostly). So it is important to frame it that way.

236 2018-09-06 11:26:14 One amongst many reasons that shows that MDC-A & its people are not sincere , generous and concerned about the welfare of the people is their wish for price hikes of basic commodities & suffering of the people. A genuine opposition does not do that, it supports the government.
237 2018-09-06 11:23:26 No, our billionaires are still stuck in commodities, waiting for Google and Facebook to build the network. I hear already Telcos crying foul about free platforms such as whasapp. Too bad!

246 2018-09-06 10:43:55 Inflation rate is high.
Prices of commodities are high.

248 2018-09-06 10:33:16 This is a key part of the “strong dollar” thesis.  The EM debt pressure leads to dollar demand for de-leveraging, which results in deflation in EM and commodities.

256 2018-09-06 09:58:34 I am not sure if get what you mean. Ricardo said: “The real and ultimate regulator of the relative value of any two commodities, is the cost of their production, and not the respective quantities which may be produced, nor the competition amongst the purchasers” (Vol. 1, p. 344).

259 2018-09-06 09:48:39 I feel like my head is going to explode because of the realization that I may not survive this year knowing prices of commodities are inflating. Does the government really need to tax our basic needs too high to "accelerate" the development of this country?

275 2018-09-06 08:50:37 But here's another thought, if production doesn't increase but wages do (in commodities and other other dollar export goods) then the currency will lose value which in effect reduces the effect of increased cost of labour on the dollar based profit made from exports.

323 2018-09-06 06:39:10 good morning!

Inflation rate is the increase in prices of a basket of commodities. Rice is one of those in the basket. Inflation also means high demand for products and services, it indicates that people have money and are spending it quickly. It means the economy is growing.

330 2018-09-06 06:25:24 Marketing “meat,” “dairy,” and “eggs” with the largely misleading label of “humane” makes the consumption of these commodities more acceptable among the socially or environmentally conscious- Nibert #SentientRights #Sentience #Speciesism
331 2018-09-06 06:23:04 the prices of such commodities are higher than those produced in factory farms, making them largely inaccessible to those without the ability to pay- Nibert #SentientRights #Sentience #Speciesism
332 2018-09-06 05:58:46 On their current trajectory, by the end of this month the world’s two largest economies, China and US,  are likely to have imposed punitive tariffs on manufactured goods and commodities worth $360bn & two-thirds of their bilateral trade last year @FT

336 2018-09-06 05:48:04 Hello economists. I’m just wondering how 16% VAT rise leads to increased price of other commodities more than the same (16) %age? 
NB: I am not supporting the VAT rise!! #FuelShortage
337 2018-09-06 05:43:58 @narendramodi India need to open stores around the nation for all sort of commodities with indian brand right from pin to paint with reasonable price to motivate all to be patriotic buyer which will add to growth of Indian Economy.
338 2018-09-06 05:35:27 Reducing air pollution as a causative factor contributing to asthma and asthma deaths, seems more rational than recently approving a new technique to treat chronic unresponsive asthma via NHS. Whilst not-increasing fuel duty in line with inflation or in line w/ other commodities?
339 2018-09-06 05:32:51 Hiking price of petrol, is basically increasing the prices of everything, take a look if transportation cost increases the prices of commodities increase as well @UKenyatta @RailaOdinga  SAID IS SISI
340 2018-09-06 05:29:39 hata kama kuna fuel shortage I must drive my point home. Cs Rotich is economically incompetent. VAT on fuel means indirect VAT on all commodities (including those that are tax free in books) #NiJuuYaCorruption @ntvkenya @KTNNews @citizentvkenya
341 2018-09-06 05:29:19 [MARKET UPDATE COMMODITIES] Gold is trading at 1 198-dollars and platinum at 785-dollars per ounce

342 2018-09-06 05:26:03 Concrete solutions were brought but who listened? We are here today because we can easily be manipulated. Wait till 2022 6 months before elections prices of commodities will drop at an all time low.  We jus arent angry enough
343 2018-09-06 05:21:18 My guy.... ,.. U seriously think there is need to investigate why business ppl r buying forex on the parallel mrkt at a premium so tht they can import commodities... Lol ... My 86 yr old granny will laugh and question your sanity if she reads this
344 2018-09-06 05:17:50 Tax is always a burden on the shoulders of a people,you get salary and 30% is gone with tax man, you buy commodities at 16% vat,you buy fuel that has more than three taxes added,you buy a car & custom duties is almost equal to its cost,finally someone steals the money at like NYS
345 2018-09-06 05:14:50 Please say "spend less" to a low income mother who would have to endure an average of almost 6% rise in basic commodities. Lucky for you to say that conveniently from a foriegn country with less than 3% inflation rate.
346 2018-09-06 05:11:54 #NiJuuYaCorruption the fares in Nairobi are going up, #NiJuuYaCorruption The Price of all basic commodities is up, #NiJuuYaCorruption people are hacking each other to death and going unpunished, #NiJuuYaCorruption My views can only be communicated on Twitter.
347 2018-09-06 05:03:53 @PMOIndia Dear PM,
Whenever there is an increase in prices of essential commodities, government job holders get 2% hike in their allowances
348 2018-09-06 05:00:02 Commodities: Corn +0.97%, Cotton -0.69%
349 2018-09-06 04:50:42 Mr President can you balance me quickly!  Why is  there a  sudden shortage of commodities in the  shops. We have gone back to the era of empty shops and inflated prices?This is a very bad early sign that you will not be able to manage the country alone. Please call out for ideas.
350 2018-09-06 04:46:42 one of the reasons why poor people even pay more for essential commodities cos of the risk involved in opening up a store in a poor community
351 2018-09-06 04:44:52 Fracassei? Bom, nunca precisei do governo pra nada. Consegui tudo por lutar. Os “anos Lula” tiveram um boom financeiro pela elevação “mundial” do preço das commodities, como soja e petróleo. Mesmo assim, o país não se firmou e despencou após a “marolinha” do ladrão.
352 2018-09-06 04:43:02 Great!
Lets draw a Time line for construction - operational activities & adhere to the timeline.

Also start searching faculties, a rare commodities.

All the best to the Aspirants of IIMs
353 2018-09-06 04:36:12 How stupid can a commission be ? How the hell do you expect those commodities to reach the customers if not by transportation and the key element used for transportation has gone up by 16% !! The cost of power has gone up too !!
354 2018-09-06 04:34:09 These men are precious commodities. What does my life mean to them? How am I supposed to determine the next time or the next time.
355 2018-09-06 04:31:48 I posted some interesting reading materials on commodities and real assets...the pieices discuss the potential impact of trade issues...
356 2018-09-06 04:31:35 Increase prices of all basic commodities. #Kenyans will queue in all major outlets, buy everything in the shelve & then rant in tweeter. A new scandal comes up and they will forget. Life goes on. @kot gives the best advice/resist online, no one will do it physically.#FuelShortage
357 2018-09-06 04:31:33 Why borrow loans to enrich a chosen few?
Why tax basic commodities to overburden the least privileged?
We can do with what we have, just eradicate corruption!!

#fuelshortage
358 2018-09-06 04:25:07 Especially if it's a utility commodity (like energy, water,...even better: waste! because no retails investor wants to own empty plastic bottles) when you tokenize: you get virtual commodities that are a store of value, means of exchange and a unit of account.
359 2018-09-06 04:24:54 We must center Black women & their intellectual & cultural productions. We also know Hollywood & media reduces them to commodities & objects for consumption. This is dangerous & dehumanizing. This happening w/ #Whitney & these convos re: #BobbyBrownBET
360 2018-09-06 04:24:42 #FuelShortage is equal to high costs of production which is equal to high cost in transportation which is equal to high cost of commodities leading to high costs of living translating to rise in poverty levels and crime be on the increase and with that, we are in deep trouble
361 2018-09-06 04:22:54 And generalize fictitious commodities from land labor and capital to those with pervasive incomplete contracts/missing markets that need an  active exercise of gov power to work. Eg Health energy environment insurance housing etc.....
362 2018-09-06 04:20:07 False hope. The second phase of TRAIN LAW is yet to come. It will be by 2019 with 30% increase on taxes. This year we had the 20% increase that has at least 50% impact on the prices of basic commodities. How much more next year. Be realistic, Madam.
363 2018-09-06 04:17:02 Ito pa! Lobong lobo na ang palitan ng piso sa dolyar!? Kung hindi mo alam ang epekto nun lalo na sa mga basic commodities na binibili ng mga mahihirap!? Bumalik ka ng highschool! At mag-aral ka ulit hanggang maka-graduate ka na alam na alam mo ang epekto nito! Mga bobo! Pweeeee!
364 2018-09-06 04:07:22 That depends din naman, may ibang ramdam na nao-offset lang talaga, meron ding ramdam ang impact because the increase of their income isn't proportional to the increase of prices of basic commodities in the market. We should not generalize all segments of the socioeconomic ladder
365 2018-09-06 03:57:53 Si usted cree que la reforma tributaria es por el precio de la paz y no por el descensos de los precios de los commodities dejeme decirle que tiene mucho que aprender.
366 2018-09-06 03:56:15 Acutally there is po. The fact that the prices of commodities rise, higher chances that the purchasing power will decline and companies will suffer due to higher input costs. Hence, corporate profit will be affected as well as their stock performances po. 
367 2018-09-06 03:51:55 Pavel: The commission is urging manufacturers not to take advantage of the 16% VAT on fuel  to increase prices of commodities. ^AM
368 2018-09-06 03:43:07 Is he the only RN who isn’t complaining? Because virtually all of the ones I know and worked with complain about burdensome salary deductions coupled with increasing prices on basic commodities- all imposed on a regular monthly income.
369 2018-09-06 03:39:34 With all that implies for energy, commodities, inflation and the economy. And human welfare.

So, oil with an effective cap of $25/barrel or lower vs solar & natural gas that are practically free.

372 2018-09-06 03:30:54 I didn't present that as a contradiction at all, I literally said the opposite.

I said "which is not to say people don't need commodities, they often do, but that's not the purpose of their production"

Which is true
373 2018-09-06 03:22:51 It is really hard to tell if @JustinTrudeau cares more for 15,000 farmers getting above-market prices for dairy commodities or the 300,000 FT existing O/S jobs and 15,000-25,000 new jobs associated with the Trans Mountain expansion, receiving below-market prices.
374 2018-09-06 03:10:43 Do you recommend equities, commodities, forex, or does asset class not matter to you?
375 2018-09-06 03:09:43 We can raise VAT on commodities even up to 90% but bado itaibiwa and we still have no money. .

376 2018-09-06 03:08:43 It was just so hard to stretch the money that i have right now.all the commodities are so high.

378 2018-09-06 03:01:46 The government has decided to raise the import tariff on 1,147 commodities, some up to 4 times their current duties, in a bid to cut back imports amidst a weak rupiah. Imported electronics will now be subjected to 7.5% tax, while 10% tax will be imposed for luxury cars & bikes.
379 2018-09-06 02:56:31 It doesn't look like that. Watch mo interview kay Finance Diokno kung bakit umabot tayo dito sa npakataas na inflation ngayun sa lahat ng basic commodities. You will know. Of course isama muna ang pinaka MAIN factor ng TRAIN 1 law na di na-anticipate ng maigi ang epekto.
380 2018-09-06 02:55:46 Too much politicking in this country is a major detriment to the improvement of our economy. Imbes na magfocus sa mataas na inflation rate at high-prices of commodities, Trillanes took away the limelight. Ugh.  Every admin masters the art of diverting important issues.
381 2018-09-06 02:51:53 hey govt. the people are more concerned about the rising prices of general commodities especially of regular staples like rice and vegetables. food. couldn't care less on how you're pulling the rug from under trillanes. solve the economy first & get rid of those corrupt guys

384 2018-09-06 02:26:03 This isn't a surprise,  what're the prices of commodities during the reign of PDP  and APC?  we all know the answer in secrecy to avoid being corrupt!
385 2018-09-06 02:12:15 Glorifying men as rare commodities, giving them ridiculous power over people’s careers, teaching them the women they work with are expendable... At least it’s getting exposed but we could (did) observe and predict ALL this based on the institutions of the ballet world. Ugh.
386 2018-09-06 02:07:06 Thanks Jeremy. Consumption accounts for a very large share of GDP and is fairly stable by nature, so the mirroring you refer to is normal. Investment is cyclical and always more volatile, but smaller. Exports are volatile too because they are dominated by commodities like oil.

392 2018-09-06 01:31:03 Primeiro mandato pegou uma herança muito boa do FHC e as commodities valorizadas. Cenário hoje seria outro.
393 2018-09-06 01:29:22 In general it is a swap of commodities for manufactured goods, only one is value added so hard to equal in dollar amounts, but both get what they want. Comes down to what labour is efficient at in both places.

402 2018-09-06 00:37:11 That doesn't matter? Soybeans are commodities bought by a globally traded futures price, a price which has lost 20% of its value due to these tariffs. That's 20% of their revenue that farmers, all soybean farmers, have lost.
403 2018-09-06 00:32:35 Nigeria has the largest resource of goatskin & kidskin in Africa.There is need for value addition in Nigeria's leather value chain to upgrade its position in the regional & global trade of leather commodities with varying implications on intra & intertrade & backward integration!
404 2018-09-06 00:30:13 Sex work is looked down on due to the fact that men still see women as commodities that should be free and accessible at all times AND THATS THE TEA
405 2018-09-06 00:21:37 As for people wanting to indulge in their interests, less would be commodified, intellectual property rights dismantled. So, the exchange value system (that which arbitrarily determines prices based on profit motive) will exist for very few commodities....
406 2018-09-06 00:18:40 The corporate definition of love is obsessed with commodities, property, and hoarding of things and experiences.
