3 2018-03-29 23:59:41 Did you just like & retweet your own tweet? 

Doing what you love is ok, doing what pays the bills allows you to do what you love. This is why Adults need to guide kids so their desire to "Do what They Love" doesn't result in PHD Baristas w 150k in debt & 2nd mortg on dads house
4 2018-03-29 23:59:38 Nolan and Buffalo are oil and water.
5 2018-03-29 23:59:27 So glad it’s raining rn. Cuz if you think imma pay for the gas, note, insurance, oil, etc and then ALSO pay to wash my car...girl you better think again.
6 2018-03-29 23:59:24 To be honest that is one of the greatest joys/perks of being a painter (for me at least) - you can touch your own artwork as much as you want to. I especially love touching my dry oil paintings where the paint is applied thickly and I can feel the texture. Its strangely enjoyable
7 2018-03-29 23:59:10 Ill just get a spill of oil for the soda for everyone
8 2018-03-29 23:59:08 I don’t know what kind of access you have, but essence of peppermint diluted in the bath does well for a good soak (maybe skip your hips, that can get uncomfortable) it also works well as a topical rub (cut it with some olive oil) or hot steam

38 2018-03-29 23:56:53 Did you know WD-40 is not just a thin sprayable oil, it's actually a combination of several hydrocarbons which help it displace water and leave a thin layer of oil on nearly any surface?

I guess what I'm trying to say is: it's freaky and awful when you get it in your eyes.
39 2018-03-29 23:56:47 Heard of this, never tried it. Mayo is basically oil, vinegar, egg and a bit o mustard? It could work 
40 2018-03-29 23:56:43 I made 3 new friends today in East Nashville at local shops and I just love my neighborhood

42 2018-03-29 23:56:17 Palm oil, coffee, chocolate, and soy are responsible for rainforest deforestation. Sugar- the gulf coast. Crops for animals, who consume far less, are also often the lower quality or machine harvested product, so it would’ve been wasted anyways.

46 2018-03-29 23:56:03 Water could be depleted far earlier than oil.

49 2018-03-29 23:55:44 17/ If true, this would be far worse than anything credibly alleged since the Judicature Acts. Not for the benefit of a drug cartel or oil baron or some shadowy cabal of financiers. For the benefit of a West Country homemaker and a business consultant.

84 2018-03-29 23:50:00 This happened to me recently too, def a combo of eating wayyy too much sugar and being inconsistent w/ my routine. I was skeptical but I tried using a little bit of coconut oil as a makeup remover/cleanser and just using Mario aha cleanser ($7!) and it’s cleared up a lot!
85 2018-03-29 23:49:57 No I’m thinking there will be many wonderful Kapler moments this year.   I despise that guy.   I want to root for them but it’s hard with Mr Coconut Oil as manager.

119 2018-03-29 23:46:37 listen I get that big oil in OK is integral to our entire functioning but 3% ??? too little. they can take some responsibility. make them pay. tax them to hell.
120 2018-03-29 23:46:27 Traffic now being released in 3 lanes on the M1.....#M1 northbound between J12 #Toddington and J13 #Brogborough.

121 2018-03-29 23:46:04 Cool, in Ontario a Bill was Just Passed that Will Make it Easier to Sue Companies for Climate Change Damage. Every Single Oil Company Should be in Court to decide How Much They Owe Us.

123 2018-03-29 23:45:59 The next major source of green house gas emissions come from transportation. Where is Canada's EV incentive program? EVs represent 50% of new cars sold in Norway so it's possible.  It's not that hard or that expensive. Just need leadership that's not owned by the oil companies

125 2018-03-29 23:45:36 I bet they collected the insurance money. Probably an oil company owned it.

130 2018-03-29 23:44:28 Good to see all the oil we were too laxy to clean up slowly drifting to theThames and out to sea. That would cost us thousands to clean. Maybe we won't be able to see it by the time our xmas bonuses arrive!!! Mwhahahahaha 
131 2018-03-29 23:44:28 Kapler was too busy jerking to his coconut oil he screwed the whole game up for us
132 2018-03-29 23:44:28 Um, it was all an act. You'll soon see, as they all get arrested, especially the dark state that ran the whole shabang.
133 2018-03-29 23:44:25 I told him we are like fire and oil. We only burn and we burn brightly. We are either the best thing for each other or the worst.
134 2018-03-29 23:44:19 When there is no government left to protect anyone from anything then whom should we blame. Giving oil/gas, Corporations, 1%, Kochs & Trump this much power as we are allowing it will not, it can not end well for the country or the ppl.

158 2018-03-29 23:42:28 Awesome!!! Looks so great.. but wouldnt oil and fire be better to say here? Since oil and water dont mix but do add up ;) oil and fire are enemies but do strengthen eachother.. but thats just me. Great piece of work 
159 2018-03-29 23:42:13 Gonna need a lot of coconut oil to cope with this loss

167 2018-03-29 23:41:24 U need to order my CBD oil . It has worked magic for me

170 2018-03-29 23:41:13 PRC wants land access to the Bay of Bengal. There will be a naval base and a special economic zone at the end of an oil/gas pipeline at #Kyaukphyu on the Arakan coast where Rohingyas used to live. 
Never ever underestimate the bullying/bribing effects of cunning Chinese commies!
171 2018-03-29 23:41:12 Hopefully a little codeine, spearmint oil and hot honey lemon tea will do the trick 
172 2018-03-29 23:41:05 Less coconut oil. More Nola. That was fucking ridiculous.
173 2018-03-29 23:41:04 ....this ad brought to you by the 'people' in the oil and gas industry.  
The real America people actually want affordable, renewable energy. The billions in profits plus the #taxscambill savings, just wasn't enough for greedy oil and gas CEOs.

I'll pass.

176 2018-03-29 23:40:54 Kapler's gonna need the coconut oil tonight.
177 2018-03-29 23:40:52 Is coconut oil alcoholic ?
178 2018-03-29 23:40:48 I needed an oil change 5000 miles ago
179 2018-03-29 23:40:48 Not happy with coconut oil rn 
180 2018-03-29 23:40:31 Really I think it applies to any corporations with enough income to write off, but in OK that basically boils down to oil.

189 2018-03-29 23:39:45 I can't believe it's still more cost effective to use oil for energy over renewables. Even making massive pipelines, contaminating water, and exhausting gases beats on site generation.

195 2018-03-29 23:38:36 You class as having close relations with them gulf states but apart from buying US weapons and keeping straits of Hormuz open the US is enemy in their primary role. Producing oil
196 2018-03-29 23:38:29 well i know that you know whats up. after all you dey his Conner. so i ask did he give out any form last two years or before he became a title in government its about ingenuity i write about and not to pour hot oil on a crawling insect i wish him good hope.

200 2018-03-29 23:37:43 With your ridiculous tax cut, I saved $6.00 more a week but I noticed that gas and oil prices have increased dramatically.  In some area's, gas prices have increased a $1.00 more per gallon.  Something is NOT RIGHT HERE!!!!!
201 2018-03-29 23:37:37 Same! I love that oil!
202 2018-03-29 23:37:33 Sounds nice
203 2018-03-29 23:37:20 Oh yes, and the eggs which were individually dipped in vegetable oil and carefully placed back in the crate, were stored in the Torpedo Room bilge where it was naturally cool, really cool in northern Lats.  The yolks were the prettiest color of green by the end of patrol! 
204 2018-03-29 23:37:18 Snake oil!! Get yer snake oil!! Step right up folks!
205 2018-03-29 23:37:15 there is absolutely nothing better to me than the feeling of getting home from a long day of racing around downtown and hopping in a nice lavender essential oil bath
206 2018-03-29 23:36:55 1. Your hair looks hella cute. And I never say ‘hella’ so it must be really great. 2. Hair grows! It grows pretty quick! 3. Avocado oil & sunshine. 
207 2018-03-29 23:36:51 The "left" that supports Russia is fake. They are paid trolls of the energy industry trying to confuse everyone. That doesn't mean the wars are not about energy. When "Islam" in KSA allowed stealing oil, the US was ok with it. If not for ISIS, there would be more pipelines.
208 2018-03-29 23:36:43 my manager got hit by a car at work today and the air conditioner broke so we were working in 90 degrees near heaters and oil fryers and shit today has been so fucking awful
209 2018-03-29 23:36:42 Hard for many of us Canadians to want to visit BC this year based on how BC feels about the rest of Canada. Probably better for you to advertise in the US for Tourist dollars, they appreciate the economic support of their oil industry.
210 2018-03-29 23:36:25 On May 5, 1960 a barrel shaped tornado touched down near Shawnee and would eventually track all the way to Sapulpa. The storm did it's worst damage in Prague where a nearby oil refinery was completely destroyed; it was rated F5. The tornado was part of a larger severe outbreak.

222 2018-03-29 23:34:51 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.

228 2018-03-29 23:34:04 The problem was allowing DPRK to get nuclear weapons in the first place and then continue to develop delivery systems, not an invasion of a  country that enslaved and murdered its own citizens, gassed its own people and Iranians, invaded two countries, lit fire to oil wells, etc.
229 2018-03-29 23:33:55 My cousin told the dons worker yesterday that I thought he’s cute and today the oil change guy. This is why I can’t go anywhere with him
230 2018-03-29 23:33:52 Oh maybe we should buy oil from Columbia
231 2018-03-29 23:33:43 That almost makes me like Nestle...almost. They have to stop: stealing water from California, promoting formula instead of breast milk in developing nations, littering the world with individual portion water bottles, deforestation for palm oil, & using child slave labor.
232 2018-03-29 23:33:38 Fair enough but most states allocation comes from our mineral resources and oil been number one on the chat
233 2018-03-29 23:33:25 Chilli oil makes everything taste better now
234 2018-03-29 23:33:15 YES  goodness! They are so tight those first few days that if you don’t oil/moisturize your edges, you may not have any by the time you can actually move your head.
235 2018-03-29 23:33:12 if you think the teacher walkout is dumb, or selfish unfollow me rn. our teachers, support staff, and us as students deserve more than the oklahoma government is giving us. we deserve funding for our schools more than big oil companies deserve huge tax breaks.

256 2018-03-29 23:30:28 Oklahoma had a budget surplus and instead of putting it to work, they decided to slash taxes to incentivize the oil business. That dried up, so there is less taxes on less production without meaningful spending cuts. It’s the same tried and true failed GOP economics over again.

259 2018-03-29 23:30:18 They realize oil is fading and they will need to shift to renewable energy sourcss to keep the revenue taps open.
260 2018-03-29 23:30:08 Who doesn't need oil?
Who? You?
In all the nations of this world, yours lives of oil.
261 2018-03-29 23:30:08 I totally agree. Roseanne Conner would’ve seen through the snake oil salesman veneer of the grifting trump family. Perhaps why people feel a real sense of betrayal by the hate spewing monster that is Barr.

271 2018-03-29 23:29:03 Oh please, once the oil runs out, you will go back to the camel herding soon. It is just the oil discovery but otherwise, you are as dump as stone, as poor as poverty itself. 
272 2018-03-29 23:28:54 In my view, one of the important factors is how buildings were constructed then versus now. The area northeast through southeast of Dallas produced many >15 plus death events in the period when shanty towns were the norm because of the oil boom in E Texas.
273 2018-03-29 23:28:43 History forgets because the next administration did it for money. It was just graduations of evil -just because her motivation appeared differently doesn’t mean it was less evil. Money or power- I guess power over the oil is the same thing
274 2018-03-29 23:28:23 Feeling some type of way...but oil and water will never mix...fuck a lane...im on a whole nother highway...walking at my turtle pace...with a smile on my face...singing to the Sun, Moon, little stars and all the elements! May you forever guide me #LOVE

283 2018-03-29 23:27:16 No Carter has it right , we don't need anymore warmongering fools advising us into wars where we waste trillions of dollars and don't even get a tiny oil well . 
Less warmongering for oil and resources isn't a bad direction for our foreign policy .
284 2018-03-29 23:27:13 And that all sorts of amateur economic opinions fail to take this into account. From gold coins to sovereign debt to the price of oil to our Social Security account, we as a country wholly misunderstand how the economy works. And that's not an accident.

286 2018-03-29 23:26:59 If you understand what medical cannabis does & if you control it u could see benefit for those in need, which will reduce the usage of opioids, but again, u need to read from both sides, don't read only the biases from big pharma. CBD oil is amazing 4 fibromyalgia & many others.
287 2018-03-29 23:26:53 How many total hours would you say went into crafting that fine piece of artwork? From concept/sketch to final oil on canvas.
288 2018-03-29 23:26:52 Sticky just means the oil hasn't polymerized enough to become seasoning yet. Keep using it! Just try to apply thinner layers of oil going forward for initial seasoning... buff dry, it shouldn't even look oily.
289 2018-03-29 23:26:50 I got my oil changed today and I think that has something to do with it.

293 2018-03-29 23:26:38 YES! Oil companies and car companies continue to externalize the true costs of every mile driven on streets and highways.
294 2018-03-29 23:26:38 DB, I lived in Anchorage for 15 yrs and worked in North Slope oil fields for 20.  A change in climate may effect sections of the 600+ miles of pipeline.  Were the pipeline straightened from its zigzag construction, it would more than double in length and opportunity for disaster.
295 2018-03-29 23:26:35 Give cbd oil a go, it might work for you!
296 2018-03-29 23:26:14 Absolutely disgusting! Even if u don't believe in climate change what about decreasing our dependence on foreign oil? What about being a country that is energy INDEPENDENT! this move shows where the oil industry $ goes.. #BlueWave

410 2018-03-29 23:11:20 These are pretty cool stories, but sadly the anti-science left has hijacked the term and turned it into a big money grab for scammy wall street financial instruments that is far more polluting than oil.

440 2018-03-29 23:08:15 going to a 6 IS THE WORST, that was my worst stretch cause i’m finally at a 4. i recommend soaking your ear in warm/hot water and lots of oil, either vitamin E or coconut oil, that worked for me
441 2018-03-29 23:08:09 Use cooking oil to take it off. Just put some oil on a paper towel and use that to get it off.

455 2018-03-29 23:05:58 Apparently Walmart’s automotive has been putting used oil in my car for the past five years. 
456 2018-03-29 23:05:44 Don't you wish you could run a business like that? No, you should definitely stay heavily invested in oil and single-handedly try to stop new/free energy progress by taxing and tariff-ing anything that makes it possible. We see you Mr. Trump.
457 2018-03-29 23:05:40 If we only had only 3 million people and state owned oil wells to pay for it all. We would also need other countries to pay for our defense.

462 2018-03-29 23:04:16 Got home from getting an oil & KJ’s black friends are playing basketball & they asked, “Is Kyle home? Can he come out & play.” Aw, too bad KJ’s still in Florida.
463 2018-03-29 23:04:09 he should go back to selling his fish oil--he'll have more success
464 2018-03-29 23:03:48 I'm tired of the whiny oil worker. You don't represent the majority of Albertans and seem to be the least resourceful group. First folks to fall for the angry dogma of the UCP. First folks to dismiss the work and the improvements to quality of life in AB under the current gov't.
465 2018-03-29 23:03:41 I’ve always found it distrurbing that the left will disrupt businesses because of political beliefs. Seems to cross a line to me
466 2018-03-29 23:03:38 1st, not gonna happen.
2nd, EV are so many because the gov waved a 25% tax. That's 10K savings on a 40K car. Simple. 
3rd, let's remember Norway courts ruled Norway is NOT responsible for downstream emissions from their oil.
Green leader? You are being FOOLED.

Nobody goes bankrupt by a hospital bill. No one has to work 3 jobs to “bootstrap”. No one that wants a university degree will be left out.
Those who make the most money pay more than those who struggle.

485 2018-03-29 23:00:58 What is jojoba? Jojoba is considered the Rolls Royce of carriers. It looks and feels like oil it is, in fact, a wax. Unlike carrier oils it does not go rancid, so it has an unlimited shelf life.

500 2018-03-29 22:58:46 Everything has a carbon footprint, to weigh one source of energy over the other is always up for debate. Not only do we need Oil other counties also, until more efficient technology comes to market. Your policies are just wrong, we have to be smart in our ability to reduce.
501 2018-03-29 22:58:45 So do I and two of my friends.
502 2018-03-29 22:58:36 Higher prices will just turn up and on the oil production in the US till it cracks again no?
503 2018-03-29 22:58:35 Not to mention higher transportation costs =higher oil prices = higher gas prices. Why can’t Canada get its shit together. Smh

You don't think we can get a better deal when we don't have to support London?

509 2018-03-29 22:57:48 Use water with the oil, it'll brown it up quicker with less oil. I was making veggie fried rice like a demon for a bit there and id like to say that shit was pure fire. Just use brown rice if you wanna be healthy.

511 2018-03-29 22:57:32 If Bezos needs any help from Nigeria it's on the governmental level. That means Big Oil or Billion Dollar Bonds. He's on another level ^_^
512 2018-03-29 22:57:26 Random health fact because I feel like it lol...I only fry things in grape seed oil because its one of the only cooking oils that doesn't release harmful toxic compounds when heated.
513 2018-03-29 22:57:16 Higher oil prices mean higher gasoline prices (this is because of refining margins) $100 oil is only good for oil co's, it is not nec. good for consumers or global growth ..oil price has to find an equilibrium and that is difficult due to the current fragility of global economics
514 2018-03-29 22:57:14 why do bmw oil change be so expensive 
515 2018-03-29 22:57:04 So since a lot of you came back yesterday after I bought the Swiss Navy and talked about how Gun Oil is the best, I went and got that one as well. Surely I won’t have to worry about lube again for a while.
516 2018-03-29 22:57:03 Drive until the oil light stays on for an hour so to burn off all the bad oil, then buy a new car.

520 2018-03-29 22:56:27 Don’t operate. Stay healthy and avoid chemo if you can. I got cannabis oil for my dad but he wanted to try immunotherapy first. And it was all too late. Buy cannabis where it is legal to do so and make your own. It’s easy. And I will pray that it works.
521 2018-03-29 22:56:12 my coconut oil stayed liquid all winter so I should've never stopped hoing, tbh.
522 2018-03-29 22:55:46 Don't think even the oil companies themselves want to see $100 again.
523 2018-03-29 22:55:33 i've had jellyfish (rhizostomae species) marinated in rice vinegar, soy and sesame oil ever since i was a kid in chinese restaurants
524 2018-03-29 22:55:30 Lmao or you leave with a oil change, broken brake light and a fucked up bumper.
525 2018-03-29 22:55:27 Me too!! The olive oil ones were 
526 2018-03-29 22:55:15 The studies are a living breathing thing. They study a rapidly changing planet and collecting new data everyday, getting closer and closer to the conclusion big oil so publicly fears. The only option left for them is to hide evidence and deny to results. Sad lil bunch.
527 2018-03-29 22:55:13 Mum put oil in my ear tonight as I still can’t hear but this time I couldn’t even feel the oil go in my ear... something is properly wrong...

533 2018-03-29 22:54:33 I swear I need to stop being so nice because strangers everywhere always feel the need to tell me their life story. Bruh, I just came here for an oil change. 
534 2018-03-29 22:54:28 Don’t mind Ambrose, ask him what is the source of the funds that drives Lagos revenue? South souths oil since 1954. He want special status for lagos. Oka rè o!

Me: Pag sure diha oy.
536 2018-03-29 22:54:20 I had a car like that.  You’re burning or leaking oil.  Put 2 quarts in and see if you see anything on the dipstick.
537 2018-03-29 22:54:17 @realDonaldTrump 
If this doesn’t make you rethink depending on coal and oil, nothing will.
538 2018-03-29 22:54:16 Luck has nothing to do with this. I got in at 1.90 it is at 4.80 and I still have not sold. Faith has ALOT more to do with this. Its not about this Oil company or even money. This is at a level u obviously have no understanding in unless u know Gods plan for his ppl in Israel.
539 2018-03-29 22:53:57 Thank goodness they were able to take that worthless oil out of our hands

543 2018-03-29 22:53:42 The point is, your parents DO pay for your college. In fact, EVERYONE pays, even if they or their children never go to college. That seems fair.
544 2018-03-29 22:53:41 You'll also need to replace the oil filter. Sounds like you have a leak somewhere, you probably want to bring it to a mechanic. Meanwhile, you might want to add some oil in, it also would be wise to not drive it too much. Disclaimer: I'm not a mechanic.

556 2018-03-29 22:52:12 I love the smell of coconut oil; more like some fresh cookies 
557 2018-03-29 22:52:08 Thanks for the heads up
558 2018-03-29 22:52:04 Please don’t compare baby oil and body highlighter 
559 2018-03-29 22:51:49 Latest batch of hummus had olive oil in it (in addition to tahini), and after a couple batches of tahini-only hummus, I see why real recipes only call for olive oil on top.
560 2018-03-29 22:51:43 Disgusting.
561 2018-03-29 22:51:30 Saudi Aramco (because it has still the largest, yet rapidly dwindling oil reserves) is the heart of the ENTIRE "economy" of the human species, nothing works without energy regardless how much and whatever kind of money is printed, typed or credited into "existence".

565 2018-03-29 22:50:17 Don't celebrate just yet. Wait n see if Abadi starts to rebuild Shingal. He got Kirkuk and its oil wells n the money that goes with it. No excuses.
566 2018-03-29 22:50:11 Right?! Like oh so the that’s what an oil change smell like? Gtfo. 
567 2018-03-29 22:50:05 BP oil was light and floated to the surface which helped with clean up. Still cost BP 62 billion to clean up. Dilbit is heavy and will sink making clean up impossible

573 2018-03-29 22:49:03 Trump and Pruitt gotta make sure the demand for oil and gas stays high to satisfy Exxon and all the other big oil donors... and of course, Russia.

577 2018-03-29 22:48:20 If you’re not even from here, why are you so obsessed with how we do things?  You seem overly concerned about America. Y’all have open borders?  Maybe some of these unhappy people wanting free stuff should come live off you instead.

581 2018-03-29 22:47:41 Funny so do we and we managed just fine last Saturday.
582 2018-03-29 22:47:39 Ah, the weird tastes of cats;

One of mine loves the one day old rests of yoghurt that are stuck to the inside of the cup, would never eat fresh yoghurt though. The other one recently developed a taste for olive oil (he's a greek rescue, so there might be kittenhood memories)
583 2018-03-29 22:47:38 Sorry but @fccincinnati is about to embarrass the @IndyEleven in their first game at Lucas Oil
584 2018-03-29 22:47:31 Coconut oil is what I use
585 2018-03-29 22:47:28 I have been calling for a divorce for about 7 years...
586 2018-03-29 22:47:25 Yeah, massage it into your scalp once a week and then wash it out- the castor oil promotes growth and the massage stimulates circulation. If you add some biotin to your diet it’ll probably grow super fast!
587 2018-03-29 22:47:19 @IAmSteveHarvey States: Oil Count thus far for Salethia L. Kennedy from a combination of three locations for testing purposes.

588 2018-03-29 22:47:15 . @GovMaryFallin can we also say thanks for sucking at your job because this bill you passed is nothing but a slap in the face to our educators and education system that’s why we rank so poorly. But yes line yours and the oil companies pockets while our teachers work multi jobs
589 2018-03-29 22:47:05 Na so 
Ur head get oil 
590 2018-03-29 22:47:04 Probs because we are SUCKING OUT ALL THE GODDAMN OIL!?!
591 2018-03-29 22:47:02 Got a free oil change today! And a coupon for a free wash and vacuum! 
592 2018-03-29 22:46:47 Energy investment is alive and well. Billions in renewable. New projects already announced in oil and gas. Lowest debt to GDP in Canada. Notley winning court battles FOR Alberta's oil and gas sector. Your comment is nonsense.
593 2018-03-29 22:46:46 I vape cbd oil. I used to just take it orally and it wasn't doing much, but the vape has helped me a lot. I get an unflavored one since the most popular flavor from that brand (Koi) was wrecking my lungs. The unflavored isn't bad, but you can also add any e-juice to it.

596 2018-03-29 22:46:42 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
597 2018-03-29 22:46:39 Wasn’t there an oil pipeline involved, too?
598 2018-03-29 22:46:30 Its be come quite clear my 4c hair hates moisturizer. Oil! Girls, OIL my scalp and fro LOVE!
599 2018-03-29 22:46:30 A difference between the effects of that and baby oil? No.
600 2018-03-29 22:46:19 You destroyed the middle east for oil. Shut the fuck up
601 2018-03-29 22:46:14 Fam those Indomie oil packets are bare annoying to open
602 2018-03-29 22:45:36 Thanks to the liberal leadership prior, our markets were strong. Harper didn’t do us any favours. Had the oil boom fallen any sooner, every con would of been calling for Harper head. But, don’t let facts get in the way of your tirade, carry on.
603 2018-03-29 22:45:31 Fukit…be nice to Canada. We’ve got shitty oil, but lots of it, we’ve got wood, grain and fish AND we’ve got Maple Syrup, Poutine, Hockey Players AND we offloaded our annoying Celine & Justin. 

Please send a SASE to Parliament Hill, c/o Me and we’ll talk…ok EH?
604 2018-03-29 22:45:23 I hear who plots against you...I hear who plans to desert you...I hear on #oil and #gold price and...and if I want I could be...? Yeah! Well just you watch that vitriolic tongue of your's!
605 2018-03-29 22:45:16 I got a paprika - lemon- olive oil based glaze to use with the lobster tails and I'm not convinced it will enhance them
606 2018-03-29 22:45:16 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
607 2018-03-29 22:45:06 Or when the butter is unsalted and tastes like straight oil
608 2018-03-29 22:45:03 Explain Dustin why are you Cowboys fan? Do carry dual citizen ship like i do? Spent 25 years in Dallas. Now living in Houston for oil and gas like all the other transplants. Atleast i still stick to my city.
609 2018-03-29 22:45:02 I need to cop some beard oil. This summer I'm not playing fair....
610 2018-03-29 22:44:54 Hi Becca, the road has had to be closed at J12. We are working to get a lane open past the incident ASAP once the oil spillage has been treated.  Will keep you updated..
611 2018-03-29 22:44:52 Wrong and very inappropriate request. So the South South that produces oil for the overall development has been the minor driver of Nigerian economy??? They do not deserve special status?? Chai!
612 2018-03-29 22:44:51 #M1 Closed northbound between J12 #Toddington and J13 #Brogborough all lanes blocked due to a multi-vehicle collision. Traffic Officers and Emergency Services working at the scene. Oil across all lanes Long delays building on the approach.
613 2018-03-29 22:44:49 Stellar Skin’s Vitamin C Facial Toner contains a special botanical blend of Lemon Fruit Oil and Grapefruit Peel Oil to help minimize the appearance of pores and prepare the skin for the absorption of serums and moisturizers.
614 2018-03-29 22:44:46 Mix the shea butter with the almond oil. 
615 2018-03-29 22:44:12 Any news as to why? My grandmas cat had a few because she had cancer. We gave her CBD oil which really helped.
616 2018-03-29 22:44:11 You know that story about the “apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.” Well what about the story about how the “oil spill kills all the fish!” Where’s that story....?!?
617 2018-03-29 22:43:43 Lmao! Saw dust and engine oil? 

Omo!
618 2018-03-29 22:43:29 Organize a march then. Try it.
619 2018-03-29 22:43:25 LOOOOL. Yo. As much as I tell other hairdressers that oil and my hair doe work I STILL come out looking like I dipped my head in a oil drum

621 2018-03-29 22:43:23 That's rubbish. You must be selectively following the media because this week I also saw investigations into the state of our hospitals, coverage of important scientific discoveries and in depth stories about climate change and the protests over oil and gas exploration.
622 2018-03-29 22:43:20 @guerillacricket There are so many delicious photos of Piggy JUST on the edge of tears during his apology that I might have to commission an oil painting of one or two of them
623 2018-03-29 22:43:16 Dentists and other oral health practitioners have lauded coconut oil for its numerous benefits – fighting bacteria, cleaning the mouth’s orifices, preventing cavities, and whitening teeth.)

625 2018-03-29 22:43:02 Biih, i never knew that there is two different type of argan oil, one for eating purposes and the other one for beaty. I thought they use the same.

626 2018-03-29 22:42:41 They don't include planes/hyperloops/drones either, these will have a huge impact on oil.
627 2018-03-29 22:42:41 @DaBoyBee Sounds good! How long has it been since you last got your oil changed?
628 2018-03-29 22:42:31 Because the 3 people who opposed the federal reserve were on that boat. Rockerfeller should have been on but didn’t turn up. He was partners in oil with Rothschilds back then. So he knew what would happen which is why he didn’t turn up. A short time later federal reserve was here
629 2018-03-29 22:42:28 How much do you purchase that come from crude oil?
630 2018-03-29 22:42:13 1 a day. You can’t convince me it’s dangerous. By comparison to other world oil ports it’s low traffic and easy access.
631 2018-03-29 22:42:11 1. Oil
2. Cause they felt like it 
3. Cause they felt like it
4. Oil
632 2018-03-29 22:42:08 How?
Efficiently.
8 hours a day. A ton of protections. Up to one year paid parental leave. Oh, did I mention free healthcare?
Taxes increase for higher wages, I’ve paid 55%. Im happy to. 
So the next generation can have free education too.
633 2018-03-29 22:41:58 my mum started putting coconut oil on the dogs before they go to sleep so they wake up smelling tropical
634 2018-03-29 22:41:50 Castor oil and scalp massages :D
635 2018-03-29 22:41:42 Vitamin E Oil is the truth. Putting it on in the evening 
636 2018-03-29 22:41:33 Oil was 10 dollars per barrel in 1998.
637 2018-03-29 22:41:30 And another thing would it be so hard to put bots in training rooms to give you something more interesting to shoot at instead of buildings and bulldozers, oil drums etc?
638 2018-03-29 22:41:29 Castor oil needs to sponsor you
639 2018-03-29 22:41:15  she see d oil pon yuh face
640 2018-03-29 22:40:53 Eat your almonds, moisturize your cuticles with coconut oil, and love yourself
641 2018-03-29 22:40:49 So either way doesn't work. The best outcome would be to prevent the pipeline then that would mean Alberta would not have access to expand it's oil exports of fossil fuels.
642 2018-03-29 22:40:37 Then u are quite stupid if a man with one leg is ahead of u in a race and u have 2... Don't u think so...  Dumb analog...  Shot Urself in the foot... And u calling me a bean head...  Na saw dust and engine oil full ur own
643 2018-03-29 22:40:33 CBD oil (no THC) is cover by the Farm Bill.  It’s considered an agricultural product and is legal in all 50 states.
644 2018-03-29 22:40:33 I wish there was Telugu twitter so I can ask people if their grandmums grated coconut on top of (and onto) oil/milk plastic bags flipper over. Is there a Telugu twitter?
645 2018-03-29 22:40:32 Like the 'Arab Oil Boycott' of the 70s, the basic vocabularly dominating popular culture on this issue is WRONG.
646 2018-03-29 22:40:17 Some of these young adults will come to regret their actions.
647 2018-03-29 22:40:12 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
648 2018-03-29 22:40:11 So true.  But what do you expect Trump to do?  Ask nicely "please kind sir, may I have your oil?  Or if I can't HAVE your oil, might I pay you handsomely for it?".   He's a thief.  Thieves take stuff.
649 2018-03-29 22:40:08 Slick as oil
650 2018-03-29 22:39:58 Wetin concern Us with oil producing state,na we give bad leaders ?

652 2018-03-29 22:38:45 my roommate leaves plates with paper towels soaked in fry oil and crumbs in her drawers instead of cleaning them
653 2018-03-29 22:38:34 Okay, that was good <3
654 2018-03-29 22:38:33 What is the price of oil per gallon? Gasoline, what is that? What is crude oil? Get the ambassador to France  on the line I want to deliver my condolences.
655 2018-03-29 22:38:32 Lives in big oil, 50 %  owned, accommodations 1 block from work.
656 2018-03-29 22:38:30 The degree was in medical science, so don’t you worry..

658 2018-03-29 22:37:56 I see a tantrum on the horizon.   Any thoughts?   Kick women out of the military? Mass deportations of DACA Kids? Nuke Iran?  Give Yellowstone to the oil companies?   Mine the grand canyon for coal?  Fire Kelly? Fire Jered?   Name Stormy Daniels chief of "staff"?
659 2018-03-29 22:37:56 For years liberals said Iraq was was War for Oil. You said nothing then and now Trump says it and you have big problem with it. And you cant even see your hypocrisy.

Highest Taxes in the world - how do they work? 
663 2018-03-29 22:36:37 CBD oil improves heart health. It reduces artery blockage, blood pressure and also cholesterol.
664 2018-03-29 22:36:36 The most common way to take CBD is simply to swallow pure CBD oil.  
665 2018-03-29 22:36:27 #SB192 will take away power from local governments that are simply trying to protect their communities from unfettered #oil and #gas development. It passed the @Colorado_Senate, and it shouldn't have. @Leroy_Garcia, thank you for voting no. #coleg #copolitics
666 2018-03-29 22:36:18 I gotta go get my oil changed now. I gotta see it to believe it
667 2018-03-29 22:36:17 There’s nothing better than getting a fresh cut. My barber even took the time to massage my beard with beard oil and conditioner. Don’t get me started on the straight edge razor too. If you’ve never been to a real shop before, do yourself a favor and get there. Treat yo self.
668 2018-03-29 22:36:03 It is? Hm... never even heard of someone else doing it

The only food related New Years Eve tradition I know is (oil) fondue or raclette (the thing with the tiny pans)

670 2018-03-29 22:35:57 In 5th week of CBD oil- not helping- I was so hopeful. If I drank my head would explode. Or I’d fall.
671 2018-03-29 22:35:45 Cannabis oil is the only thing that helps me.

682 2018-03-29 22:34:17 @rislone i accidentally put your gas treatment in my oil. Will I be fineness or should I get a new oil change?
683 2018-03-29 22:34:12 I’m sad because I spent most of my paycheck on things I had to do for my car (inspection, oil change, and registration) and I couldn’t go shopping for my self..

687 2018-03-29 22:33:03 What about all the boy's in the Military? Can they fight Israel's wars and wars for Oil killing millions. Then come home and not own a gun?

691 2018-03-29 22:32:31 I need someone to change my oil. Would you be so kind? It goes in through here... *spreads legs*
692 2018-03-29 22:32:21 Well since the #TaxScamBill positively affected the oil companies, this does make sense.
693 2018-03-29 22:32:17 So we use isopropyl alcohol at work to clean machine oil off tools and parts. I also spray it on my hands to get oil and grease off quickly but it's also an easy and surprisingly painful way to find out if you have any small cuts on your hand.
694 2018-03-29 22:32:16 Let’s wait to see how many of these cars are still holding oil in 3 years. Style has never been their problem.
695 2018-03-29 22:32:05 That is how it works. That is why you have a draft every year. Not to continuously draft the same position. You don't change the oil every week hoping for better performance. You add more power parts to go faster.
696 2018-03-29 22:32:04 Does anyone know if CBD oil will show up in a urinalysis testing for UTI? I snuck CBD to dad and they took his pee today. 
@lisapappas13  would you know?
697 2018-03-29 22:31:58 i apply super small amounts and never just straight coconut oil. my hair always has a lot of volume.
698 2018-03-29 22:31:57 Definitely.  But we have to do more than that.  They are in a business that tends towards monopoly.  Using anti trust laws to break them up - as we did with Standard Oil and the Bell System - would seem appropriate.
I think Trump is right to look into it.
699 2018-03-29 22:31:51 Just hearing the Fenty glow oil is $60. Lmao wow I love Rih but no way in this world I’m buying a body oil for $60. No sis

706 2018-03-29 22:31:29 Will he’s using a bully pulpit. You give in to a bully, he doesn’t stop he does it twice as much. She bent the knee, he says break them off. I’ll show her who’s in charge.
707 2018-03-29 22:31:19 Whats good for scars other than bio oil?? Seeing as a burn myself seven times a week in work amd my arms are a holy show, couldnt afford to keep up with bio oil:)))
708 2018-03-29 22:31:12 I took it in for an oil change and they refused to do it because the stick came up dry when they checked the level.

715 2018-03-29 22:30:22 Interesting graph. What does this mean with regard to how they spent money before the price of oil dropped?
716 2018-03-29 22:30:13 Well its a rough estimate for the cost of clean up and 30+ years of lost economic output from a myriad of industries including fisheries and tourism. I mean really, who would want to visit an oil soaked coast lined with dead whales?
717 2018-03-29 22:30:12 Our old Brazilian rose oil and the boys from Brazil have something in common: they were all made in a lab.
718 2018-03-29 22:30:09 it gives rural Albertans something to do when oil prices are low?

725 2018-03-29 22:29:27 “Help I have a crush on the guy that changed my oil” 

“Girl you better break your oil so you can see him again”
726 2018-03-29 22:29:19 She's tweakin. I can mix Trophy Wife with some body oil and call it a day lol
727 2018-03-29 22:29:13 Oil and coal, oh wait, renewable?
728 2018-03-29 22:29:12 @dobermanmamma  Always remember, these people are the “oil pipelines,” of the internet.  They run though our culture making a profit without remorse! They are stealing food and money off the tables of Native Americans by opening multiple accounts!
729 2018-03-29 22:29:04 Oil-E-Coyote....SUUUUUUUPER-Genius!!
730 2018-03-29 22:28:54 Whether Buhari government performs or not, it still would not change the exchange rate. Plain and simple. It's not Buhari's fault that the price of oil fell. It's just the reality of Nations that are oil based or single export entity based. Economy na oscillation not magic!
731 2018-03-29 22:28:46 If Standard Oil determines its in their best interest to buy other companies, that’s their prerogative too. Oh no, wait, the government dismantled Standard Oil. 

Have you heard of a public utility? They’re regulated, and profit motivated private companies.
732 2018-03-29 22:28:44 I have a 5ft oil painting to finish in a month why the fuck have I done this to myself
733 2018-03-29 22:28:32 Every night, always something to learn or do, be it stream, Twitter, or learning how to edit videos for upcoming YouTube. Pro tip guys have a dream burn that midnight oil.  
734 2018-03-29 22:28:20 It's the hemp oil. It doesn't have the thc in it like marijuana.
735 2018-03-29 22:28:13 Just throwing this idea out for discussion: Feds are not creating viable investment climate for private oil & gas industry. PET created the Canadian national oil company, Petro-Canada in 1975. I wonder if the current Liberal gov't has a plan to re-visit that policy?
736 2018-03-29 22:28:12 “With oil and salt, NOT butter”  dead
737 2018-03-29 22:27:49 I guess you could say they got stung
738 2018-03-29 22:27:45 It's not just oil Andy and you seem like a switched on guy so you know that , I'm no economist but we are UKs cash cow , they ain't hanging on to us for our good manners .....
739 2018-03-29 22:27:38 They won’t leave the oil fields to Assad as it would provide him the money required to rebuilt his country. The US are in Syria for many years.
740 2018-03-29 22:27:26 ima learn how to change my own damn oil.
741 2018-03-29 22:27:17 Wild growth oil!
742 2018-03-29 22:27:11 Now imagine one car plant only produces cars when cars are in High demand and shuts down on low demand or if the weather gets bad, but cars still required (oil and ng). Better yet, subsidized by car credits so when they aren’t producing cars..they make money anyways (solar/wind).
743 2018-03-29 22:26:53 when ya car need synthetic oil< lol. jesus
744 2018-03-29 22:26:35 quick hack: just buy some loose highlight and mix it with some body oil! BOOM, you have your own body lava for the low

749 2018-03-29 22:26:03 We’re just being silly. Trading 10-20 lots of crude oil per week, who cares what the damn price is!
750 2018-03-29 22:25:56 I dont do anything crazy special. It is a 3 step routine tho. I usually just wash/scrub my face, use a toner and use a REALLY hydrating moisturizer and face oil cuz ya girl is dryyyy
751 2018-03-29 22:25:51 So glad I only went there once for an oil change. Goddamn.
752 2018-03-29 22:25:47 i made a scrub out of brown sugar, lemon, and olive oil and hhh my skin feels fucking soft rn
753 2018-03-29 22:25:40 Now, now, I’m sure he had some lively town halls with the NRA and oil execs, and Cambridge Analytica.
754 2018-03-29 22:25:21 To whoever spray painted my car... I hope hell is very hot, and that you bath in cooking oil with a heated blanket
755 2018-03-29 22:25:08 Now I can’t wait to hear what @AngeloCataldi has in store for tomorrow!  No Kingery.  Nola pulled after 68 pitches!? Someone is drunk on coconut oil
756 2018-03-29 22:25:07 ok time to whip up a moisture pack for my hair. Coconut milk, avocado oil, hibiscus and aloe vera should do it.
757 2018-03-29 22:25:06 A true hippie’s shopping list:
• Coconut oil
• Kale
• Yerba mate
• 2 packs of cigarettes (the organic kind)
758 2018-03-29 22:24:50 I thought I needed to rush to find somebody to love but all I needed was some coconut oil. #coconutoilsolvesallproblems
759 2018-03-29 22:24:42 Coconut oil goes well with pretty much everything, even with coffee :-)
760 2018-03-29 22:24:26 Does anyone here use CBD oil for anything? I've been using it a few weeks and it really has helped me alot with my pain and mood. It's amazing. Doesn't taste good but works good for my fibromyalgia and every thing else.I have PTSD and anxiety so I'm glad it's helping with my mood
761 2018-03-29 22:24:24 They're going to ban you if you keep on making sense
762 2018-03-29 22:24:18 When u drop your essential oil diffuser that was full of water and oils!!! 
763 2018-03-29 22:24:04 Meanwhile I'm charging my crystals in the sun and watching a documentary about blue and red lights on how they're fucking humans up. No palm oil easter eggs for me
764 2018-03-29 22:23:31 Since when does the guy who's doing ur oil change come in and sit down next 2 u w/ terrible news about an air filter? #IOnlyWantAnOilChange!
765 2018-03-29 22:23:14 Skin product tip: if anything advertised as “with tea tree oil” has denatured alcohol/alcohol denat in its ingredients (esp. if it’s before the actual tea tree oil) it’s TRASH and will strip your skin if all its natural oils 
766 2018-03-29 22:23:13 Texan conservative in #Mogadishu. I bet he’s oil interest as @SomaliPM.
767 2018-03-29 22:23:06 Oil paints are so forgiving cause they take so long to dry 
768 2018-03-29 22:23:03 Seattle (WA) Times-Business: Advocacy group: Exxon knew of corruption in oil deal
769 2018-03-29 22:22:28 Some new exclusive oil is getting shipped
770 2018-03-29 22:22:27 Bc we took fuel from the US military oil reserve and brought it to commercial markets bc we cut funding in 2011 due to being in peace times HOWEVER that stopped and now that gas is no longer available to the people and domestic fuel production is at an all time low. That is all.
771 2018-03-29 22:22:18 I use the Primer Water from Primark although I have combination/oily skin and this primer says that hydrates and refreshes but surprisingly it works on my skin!! Also the components of this primer are so good!! (Silicone,alcohol and oil free)
772 2018-03-29 22:22:08 My skin has been so dry recently that I basically bathed in lotion and coconut oil
773 2018-03-29 22:22:07 Where in the heck is this kids mother?  My kid would have no way to tweet as his phone would be off.
774 2018-03-29 22:22:07 Oil and real estate... "Output from real estate agents and brokers fell 12.8 per cent  in January, the largest monthly decline since November 2008."
775 2018-03-29 22:21:51 #AvacadoToast done correctly is Chibatta bread toasted with olive oil on a skillet, avacado or guacamole, topped with thick sliced bacon.  Made at home of course.
776 2018-03-29 22:21:41 Argan oil and coconut milk Shea butter. Soft hair and skin 
777 2018-03-29 22:21:33 Letting him finish the inning is the right move 100% time there. Too much snake oil for old kappy
778 2018-03-29 22:21:30 Unless it’s steel used for oil and gas. That’s evil.
779 2018-03-29 22:21:28 The situation has become more precarious with Chinese Yan futures now being traded on the market starting this week. 

The big problem is the US currency is backed by oil, not gold.  It’s called the PetroDollar. 

War with Iran is inevitable in order to preserve it.
780 2018-03-29 22:21:27 And everything in the Middle East has something to do with oil! What does your dad do? He’s an engineer, ow is he like a petrol or oil engineer?
781 2018-03-29 22:20:56 Thanks to Tony for supplying the cooking oil.
782 2018-03-29 22:20:42 What I can't understand is we here miracle cures from the likes of cannabis oil etc etc, why the hell is the likes illegal here, I know for a fact if I go down with it I'll get some somehow.
783 2018-03-29 22:20:10 As long as you don't use my castor oil or mascara
784 2018-03-29 22:20:09 And they use Palm oil in their products, AND they use child slavery for their chocolate.
785 2018-03-29 22:20:06 Pruitt left OK with fracking, earthquakes & more kids with asthma. He copied big oil data in his many baseless lawsuits against the EPA. The GOP approved his nomination despite his prior corruption. They simply don't care about anything except their donors. @GOPoversight @GOP
786 2018-03-29 22:19:59 Never in my life have I waited TWO HOURS for my oil change. I’m so annoyed
787 2018-03-29 22:19:51 Cetaphil oil control spf, the one with the purple top

789 2018-03-29 22:19:32 This isn’t actually Morgan Freeman is it?   Hi Beth!
790 2018-03-29 22:19:28 Just inflated his ego even more. He wins again.
791 2018-03-29 22:19:24 Nothing “bold” about taking your starter out after 68 pitches. Must be time for a coconut oil rub down. #BeBold
792 2018-03-29 22:19:20 
793 2018-03-29 22:19:19 Coconut oil every night
794 2018-03-29 22:19:18 I’m just saying it’s not a personal attack on oil field workers. That’s all I’m saying
795 2018-03-29 22:18:52 Iran used there WMD on March 1st by banning US Dollars in trade, including oil. That’s an existential threat to the US economy. They’ve become embolden after defeating us in Syria, Yemen & Somalia. 

Saddam used he WMD (Euro’s) on October 30th, 2000.

It’s a double edged sword.
796 2018-03-29 22:18:49 Justin Trudeau doesn't want Oil and Gas to increase or pipelines to be built so the process becomes so onerous that it is the companies cancelling the project then they tell us it is a business decision.
797 2018-03-29 22:18:33 His speech was full of lies, having the audacity to say the oil pipelines were easy to do,even though it was illegal on many fronts , proof he operates outside the law for his business buddies ,truth is he ran rough shot over the indigenous Native Americans Trump = Cultural Bully
798 2018-03-29 22:18:25 RT @TonyD1070: RT to win a family 4 pack for the Lucas Oil Stadium home opener for the @IndyEleven on Saturday night! @jmv1070 & I will pick the winner tonight!
799 2018-03-29 22:18:22 Same answer.

Wastewater is injected in all oil fields. There are Microseismic emissions with every mass movement (like depleating a water reservoir). Felt earthquakes aren’t created by these changes in mass. Felt earthquakes (4.0 or higher moment magnitude) are tectonic.
800 2018-03-29 22:18:17 So I drive a stick shift car right.. I just took my car to get an oil change and watching this kid try to drive my car inside the garage was the funniest thing 
801 2018-03-29 22:18:10 I've been withholding judgment on HB1024 until I could hear some numbers. I have heard enough. This is appalling. The legislature of Oklahoma is not working for the people. The majority of us are not 'big oil'. Voters are tired of this nonsense and will remember at the polls.
802 2018-03-29 22:18:08 Dropped and spilt my £40 face oil this morning and it's mostly all gone  loving life 
803 2018-03-29 22:17:56 If you want to punish Russia use less energy. Let oil prices tank again
804 2018-03-29 22:17:51 So now your fan base counts cups as a manor trophy, earlier some of your fans didn’t  not denying you won a few trophies. Not as many as you have when oil arrived. It’s kind of a fact. Fact are hard to argue with, as they are .. well.. facts
805 2018-03-29 22:17:42 I spilled oil on my carpet so now my room smells like vanilla and patchouli all the time
806 2018-03-29 22:17:16 Stop taking meds and using gasoline etc . Because politicians and trump family owns oil companies you all might as well all go back to the Stone Age
807 2018-03-29 22:17:14 Does trump think oil is something that you can take home with you?
808 2018-03-29 22:17:14 Will somebody (especially in government) please finally admit that fracking was, is and always will be a bad and dangerous idea and tell their fossil fuel friends to stop doing it? We don't need oil that desperately.
809 2018-03-29 22:17:05 That is exactly why the USA sanctions Venezuela so that they can control the oil supply, this way stagnating production in other economies for themselves to profit and supply!
810 2018-03-29 22:16:44 Blood gold & Blood oil heavily traded by Criminal Narc Venezuelan Government facing Petro CriptoCurrency scam #FinancingTyranny #BloodOil
811 2018-03-29 22:16:43 ATTENTION!!!
for those of you that have been skeptical about the Amika brush iron. This is one side done and one side not she did use the Lanza Healing Oil in it before she used the brush. The oil helps with  hydration from using heat and adds shine to the hair.
#loveamikabrush
812 2018-03-29 22:16:26 Try argan oil! You can a bottle for about $6 from The Ordinary. Doesn't have any extra things in it that irritate sensitive skin like most "mousterizers". Source: my skin turns red when caressed by the gentlest of light breezes.
813 2018-03-29 22:16:00 I’m gonna try that next time! I just fried it in some oil... it was basically plantain chips... but it wasn’t too bad... if I waited a few more days it would have been ready, but I was hungry now lol
814 2018-03-29 22:15:59 That's a plausible strategic shift. As far as I know Syria is just a desert and a Russian proxy state. US planners may have shifted focus to Iran, a more important player and significant oil producer.
815 2018-03-29 22:15:45 Also, cotton ball perfume bombs. You soak cotton balls in perfume or essential oil and place it around your house like between sofa cushions, furniture, air condition panels etc. 
816 2018-03-29 22:15:42 I'm trying CAMP skincare out of toronto because it's really important to me to have it be palm oil free.
817 2018-03-29 22:15:39 Takes car to get oil change/tire rotation. $91.93. Gets call from Hyundai. I need new brakes. Total cost? $421.00...
818 2018-03-29 22:15:34 うんぎゃー、かわいい
819 2018-03-29 22:15:30 It's all cooked with peanut oil and I have life-threatening allergies to peanuts
820 2018-03-29 22:15:10 oil sands. Lol. It's called oil sands
821 2018-03-29 22:14:44 It’s not about about the people working in the oil fields. They’re targeting the fat cats.
822 2018-03-29 22:14:39 It’s value is measured by the weapons it purchases and money and oil it supplies the West. What would the Saudis do to people taking arms against its army ? Assad is Syria’s leader
823 2018-03-29 22:14:16 the fork in the pan oil omg
824 2018-03-29 22:14:04 Tried to replace the bulb on my headlight and got SUPER close to doing it but the wire thingy wouldn't clasp so I took what I had done to an oil change place and they didn't even charge me. Whew!
825 2018-03-29 22:13:40 Yes, WitchHazel, Teatree oil, Rose Water, and Vitamin E oil
826 2018-03-29 22:13:39 Getting high and doing all kinds of oil paintings.
827 2018-03-29 22:13:33 @oilfractals @Oil_Tradr (1/2) I wanted to bring this to your attentions. Remember how Jimboman stated how fun it was to short Enron back in the day. Well maybe there is another big short we can partake in. Amazon!
828 2018-03-29 22:13:30 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
829 2018-03-29 22:13:30 Mommy and baby are home!!!!  so who is bringing me a wegmans sub? I want a half ham and American cheese with everything but sweet peppers sub oil and mayo!!!! Pretty please and thank you
830 2018-03-29 22:13:25 Coconut oil shortage in Georgia
831 2018-03-29 22:13:05 What in the wide world of coconut oil is going on?? Doing Nola dirty. At least let him throw one more pitch so he could finish with 69 pitches
832 2018-03-29 22:13:00 The countries of northern Europe have been addressing the carbon issue without damaging their national economies. The carbon tax encourages positive change, without disrupting the oil industry with regulations.
833 2018-03-29 22:12:57 Prep meal idea
- Tandoori Chicken breast
- Mixed / grilled vegie salad 
- Potato hash with mushrooms 
~ Sour cream with mint and olive oil 

Mix and match : 
1. Burritos (breakfast add eggs) 
2. Aglio olio pasta
3. Chicken garden salad
834 2018-03-29 22:12:49 Jesus could apparently turn canola oil, stale ice cream cones and bi-carb soda into butter.
835 2018-03-29 22:12:28 At Toyota of Naperville getting an oil change trying to convince myself not to trade in my car for a 2018 Avalon 
836 2018-03-29 22:12:26 Jeez Billy it runs incredibly well. How old is it? Do you need to oil it regularly?
837 2018-03-29 22:12:15 Gabe Kapler could #BeBold and sneak in a tube of coconut oil for his pitchers
838 2018-03-29 22:12:12 So watching the elemis section on @qvcuk and they are recommending rose oil and lavender for sensitive skin. Companies need to realise that some people’s skin is sensitive to exactly those things!
839 2018-03-29 22:12:01 Bristol, VA - Oil or hydraulic fluid on the road at Lee Highway and exit 10, extra slick.  Authorities have been notified.
840 2018-03-29 22:12:00 If you were looking to identify or detect anything using machines...what would it be?  Would it be identifying a blood type? How about a different grade of oil? Or even telling the difference between seeds?

WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO IDENTIFY? #yeg #agchat #MedEd #science #Detective
841 2018-03-29 22:11:51 Oh wow wow wow. So oil then,
842 2018-03-29 22:11:41 Till the resources are spent middle east oil , afghanistan its opium to produce Heroin , Columbia its the concaine .
843 2018-03-29 22:11:40 i’ve been using my exfoliating brush with coconut oil as my face wash and my face loovvessss it
844 2018-03-29 22:11:39 A bacon burger with barbecue sauce and avocado would be real nice right now  cooked with some cannabis oil  with a Brooklyn lager on the side  #ImAFatSkinnyMan
845 2018-03-29 22:11:16 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
846 2018-03-29 22:11:14 Coconut Oil just over-managed the Braves back into this game.
847 2018-03-29 22:10:28 Hon Amara Mohamed Konneh, Robert Sirleaf and others named in the Global Witness' report for accepting bribe in the sale of oil block 13.
848 2018-03-29 22:10:24 All these products for acne and the only thing that works for me is dial soap and baby oil i just dont get it
849 2018-03-29 22:10:23 I think you're on to something. LIMONENE: The active ingredient in orange oil-based termite treatments is D-limonene. Orange oil kills termites by breaking down their exoskeletons and destroying their eggs.
850 2018-03-29 22:10:22 …ぐぅ
851 2018-03-29 22:10:18 Is seaburg still bear oil "going under 40?"  Asking for a friend.
852 2018-03-29 22:10:07 全ての油という油に感謝しているよ。
853 2018-03-29 22:09:42 Just searched for my keys frantically for five minutes before remembering that I dropped my car off, with the keys, to have the oil changed a block from work and walked back. I'm losing it.
854 2018-03-29 22:09:35 Get one and maybe, just MAYBE I'll give you an extra 20ml perfume oil of the same brand
855 2018-03-29 22:09:27 My oil stocks
856 2018-03-29 22:09:21 In upstream domestic Oil & Gas - Pioneer, Newfield, Anadarko, Southwestern, Devon, and Occidental. Chesapeake and EOG are also historically very progressive on new tech adoption (but primarily internal build).
857 2018-03-29 22:09:01 Thanks @GridAtlas. This is a great product for the oil industry.
858 2018-03-29 22:09:00 Coconut oil fixes everything
859 2018-03-29 22:08:41 "Testified" was he in court?
Cut the silly inflammatory rhetoric. 

Sounds like your beef is with the head of the pipeline Association anyway.

Line 9 starts moving oil this fall and Keystone is coming too. 

How much is enough?
860 2018-03-29 22:08:39 When women ask me what tanning lotion i use for the summer time they always act so surprised when i say baby oil or hairspray
861 2018-03-29 22:08:17 Those people supporting Nina are the same people who believe every olive oil is an anointing oil 

I no sure if una go dey OK las las #BBNaija
862 2018-03-29 22:07:56 Haha sure 
I’ll fax u a little bit of it 
Or there is another way I’ll send u the bottle of beard oil 
863 2018-03-29 22:07:42 This is bullshit they building a massive base right next to the biggest oil and gas field . They doing as they done in Iraq and Libya stealing the oil  they are there illegally . Since Yugoslavia they have done much damage without UN mandate . MIGHT IS RIGHT
864 2018-03-29 22:07:40 Extra virgin olive oil.... 

One has a class a... 
865 2018-03-29 22:07:34 We don't use extra virgin olive oil because there's no need. We use the second pressing (olives) which tastes much better.
866 2018-03-29 22:07:30 I use sleep like other black people use coconut oil. Or like grandma uses Tussin for everything.

869 2018-03-29 22:07:11 #farcry5 What the hell is this tone? Cruel, dark cult shenanigans combined with GTA satire. It's like oil and water. I'm way into the fishing though.

871 2018-03-29 22:06:51 Tomorrow bout to be a bitch I gotta go to the barbershop get a oil change stuff for the rode and my baby gotta Easter party at school
872 2018-03-29 22:06:45 Thank-you for remembering it’s supposed to be :

Not For oil derricks and gas refineries.
873 2018-03-29 22:06:21 I'm not surprised any more   oil salesmen aren't to b trusted 
874 2018-03-29 22:06:20 You know we’re like oil and water 
875 2018-03-29 22:06:16 I like the olive oil and cracked pepper, I always eat too many. Lotta roughage there, but totally worth it!
876 2018-03-29 22:06:16 Of course it does!
Global warming is a very simple and basic scientific fact!

Anyone denying it is either extremely stupid or has financial motives (oil companies) !
877 2018-03-29 22:05:36 Try olive oil and Zatar on freshly backed pitta bread its the best
878 2018-03-29 22:05:32 Thanks for the response.  Think I should take the risk and try using the anise extract (oil) and ground cardamom to see how it turns out?
879 2018-03-29 22:05:32 Been doing it for twenty years, from little vehicles like a B2000 Mazda, a Beretta, and a Peugeot 208 to big vehicles like a Ram 2500 with a 10,000lb camper and a 105,500lb Kenworth full of crude oil. And a lot inbetween.
880 2018-03-29 22:05:32 (Cuts or Inflammation) mix “Coconut oil & turmeric” for an all natural external medicine, it’s SUPER powerful 
881 2018-03-29 22:05:20 The fact that my new car scraped and is now leaking oil has me soooooo pissed off
882 2018-03-29 22:05:17 Coconut oil is amazing.  I use it in my hair, cook with it, and my dog loves it too. #dailygoodiebox
883 2018-03-29 22:05:13 #Oil companies are reaping a huge profits right now, and so is other unscrupulous, short-sighted #Capital interest. When we regain control, the proper mechanisms must be put in place to recover equity over time. It can be practicable. It can be reasonable. It must be inexorable.
884 2018-03-29 22:05:01 He meant making deals with oil nations
885 2018-03-29 22:04:57 You may have addressed this at some point already, but I have to believe that some climate change deniers actually believe it’s happening and want the polar ice cap to melt - more access to oil and shipping lanes. Thoughts?
886 2018-03-29 22:04:51 “It’ll take about an hour for the oil change.” Well it’s been almost 2 hours and I haven’t heard a damn thing. 
887 2018-03-29 22:04:34 ..and let's not forget? 
Trump and Scott Pruitt opened 90% of Americas Continental Coastline for oil exploration and drilling?
Next holiday season we all will be dipping our shrimp and lobsters in motor oil thanks to these Bozos 
888 2018-03-29 22:04:29 astonishing oil and grime deposits whose precise proveniences it doesn't bear too much thinking about
889 2018-03-29 22:04:21 Mete fuel oil la banda
890 2018-03-29 22:04:15 Does it bother anyone else how they don’t care about the oil spot on the floor 
891 2018-03-29 22:04:07 Sounds nice, will ordinary vegetable oil work?
892 2018-03-29 22:04:07 I just ate some chili and I grabbed the nearest bottle to me for a drink and it was an eSSENTIAL OIL I almost drank that, omg
893 2018-03-29 22:04:03 FUX SCHMOOZE - “Where you’ll never find commentators who know what the fuck they are talking about.” I think maybe she has inhaled too many gun-cleaning oil fumes - also explains the curls in her dye-job.
894 2018-03-29 22:03:51 Where’s the cheapest oil change?
895 2018-03-29 22:03:38 Pass the coconut oil, Todd
896 2018-03-29 22:03:28 Lol I think I remember that! Was it in what is now Victoria Quarter?  Full of Afghans (the coat not dog or national) and patchouli oil!   The first LEEDS Virgin Records along the way?   Good times.
897 2018-03-29 22:03:23 I love how they smell!
Sometime I'll put clove oil in an oil burner. So good.
898 2018-03-29 22:03:13 Sitting in a lobby waiting for my oil to be changed and a country song came on and I actually liked it.....

I don't know who I am anymore.
899 2018-03-29 22:03:10 The world can only use so many women’s studies majors.
900 2018-03-29 22:03:02 They also use the oil to pay for terrorism... The people don't get the benefits. Don't be naive.

Hey I put one my bowls up for sale if anyone is interested! It's maple and about 6" across and 2" tall. I finished it with some Mahoney's walnut oil. Food safe! Link is in my bio or JGSpoons on Etsy. #woodturning #bowlturning #woodbowl

905 2018-03-29 22:02:20 And it wouldn’t hurt the middle eastern companies because the oil is already here it’s just awful
906 2018-03-29 22:02:16 If we mounted them to AC generators we wouldn't need oil.

Same when they flip between "support the troops" and "I need guns to shoot the troops".

923 2018-03-29 21:59:16 You people that have thighs that touches each other when you walk. Which engine oil do you use for lubrication to prevent wear and tear due to the friction? 

Asking for a friend though..
924 2018-03-29 21:59:05 I usually eat it with veggies, goat cheese, or use it as salad dressing with a little olive oil.
925 2018-03-29 21:58:57 Back in the 70's i ran a garage/gas station ,the delivery tanker operator told me it cost eight cents a gallon from ground to the pumps. given a few years later it probably still only costs maybe 50 cents per gallon..so why are the oil co's trying to bankrupt us
926 2018-03-29 21:58:52 Dana is one powerful chick. 
927 2018-03-29 21:58:44 this question is like looking for oil in kastina state and Chad basin
928 2018-03-29 21:58:43 I hate gettng my oil changed cause theirs always some extra shit
929 2018-03-29 21:58:41 The math doesn't work 1.5-1.8 trillion in infrastructure improvements, 200 million in the budget. Only DeVos could make that math work. Careful when he tries to setup you a bridge.... Snake oil salesman.
930 2018-03-29 21:58:33 finally saw that Neutrogena body oil in stores y'all forgot to mention the price huh? Baby oil gel does the same thing for $2.99 even comes in shea butter..
931 2018-03-29 21:58:17 Par for the course. When he said "we" should have STOLEN the oil, he didn't mean he would help, and he didn't say it would be for the U.S., he intended it for HIS coffers.
932 2018-03-29 21:58:06 When they realize you can turn plastic into oil maybe the recycling stage will occur.
933 2018-03-29 21:57:54 Today I registered and inspected my car, got an oil change, filled my gas tank and got groceries. I’ve never felt so broke in my life.
934 2018-03-29 21:57:48 you need2 grow a high thc plant to get cbd after your heat it in the oil [when making your own medicine] its a simply process of degradation that induces the high into a healing..many fail to see that even by burning high thc its become cbd by the process by which it was concumed
935 2018-03-29 21:57:47 Did I ever mention how much I love sesame oil? It’s like a magic ingredient for me
936 2018-03-29 21:57:42 EZ shares +0.7% (+1.5% for wk, -2.2% for mth), US shares +1.4% (+2% for wk, -2.7% mth) led by tech stocks as Trump spokesperson said not planning to take action against Amazon. US 10 yr yld -4bp to 2.74%. Oil +0.8% to $64.9, gold flat, iron ore -0.1%. ASX futures +0.2%. $A 0.7679
937 2018-03-29 21:57:21 Agree 100% but it has everything to do with the Obama's portraits and we know Trump is a petty fool obsessed with the Obamas. Oil portraits are now something to be concerned with? Pruitt, Zinke, Carson & Mnuchin robbing us blind but you know, portraits 
938 2018-03-29 21:57:13 Morgan Freeman, just another Hollywood has been with nothing better to do
939 2018-03-29 21:56:47 @FordAdvantage just had the worst experience of my life at your service center. Just picked up my focus that I dropped off on March 13 to have the recalled defective clutch replaced, again. Told the clutch ruined the transmission seal which leaked oil over the lever/cylinder.
940 2018-03-29 21:56:46 We expelled spies which doesn't affect us. They expelled people that help their tourism, bad for them. Russian economy is about the same size as Italy. Oil and tourism.
941 2018-03-29 21:56:40 Eat some coconut oil and bwile ginger and garlic. Trust me ntn nah shake yuh
942 2018-03-29 21:56:33 I finally caved and bought an oil diffuser ladt time I was sick. It worked wonders with the Breath Easy Oil just let that baby run all night
943 2018-03-29 21:56:28 Damn that is lucky
944 2018-03-29 21:56:27 Lol, how old are you?
945 2018-03-29 21:56:25 When they see weakness in oil price, they come out with some statement.  They want to take WTI to 80.  Six months ago nobody thought it will reach 66.  This is how Jawboning really works.
946 2018-03-29 21:56:15 i was putting a cucumber back at work today & a woman stopped me to ask where the olive oil was so i pointed her in the right direction & then i got thinking what if traffic directors used cucumbers to direct traffic & i started cracking up..my humor is also goin downhill
947 2018-03-29 21:56:09 @BootsUK Is it true that Boots is now one of the last remaining high street brands stocking krill oil, and the last UK retailer selling an own brand krill product? (!)
948 2018-03-29 21:56:07 Have you tried curcumin therapy? You can purchase powdered Organic curcumin on Amazon. Directions on the bag. I mix a little olive oil with it. One woman took a large dose- (discuss w doctor)it stopped her cancer from going any further and she was stage 4
949 2018-03-29 21:56:00 I totally agree. I have not used but know the benefits from it and once legal I’m sure I will partake Lol my bones ache. I hear cannabis oil cures a lot of things too.
950 2018-03-29 21:55:43 It must be humiliating for your kid. Having to adjust their dreams to your wishes.
Again, ideally parents wouldn’t have to pay. My parents couldn’t have paid for 7 years of University. Luckily I live in a country where college is free, so everyone can get the education they want.
951 2018-03-29 21:55:39 I guess the coconut oil idea is working fine

955 2018-03-29 21:55:09 #jezabel Proverbs 5:3-5      For the lips of the adulterous woman drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil; but in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword.  Her feet go down to death; her steps lead straight to the grave
956 2018-03-29 21:55:04 Nope, that’s not how it works or worked. They all know it’s not their money and there’s only limited things we’ll support. Weirdly, they’re all completely fine with that including the 27 year old structural engineer who has stated she’ll do exactly the same thing with her kids.
957 2018-03-29 21:54:51 Yes, and solar has been a potential cost-saver for them for ~5 yrs now, particularly when global oil prices were higher.  Question only is why is this moving so slowly?
958 2018-03-29 21:54:50 I havea paper coming out on air quality changes in the oil sands region - will DM when it's released!
959 2018-03-29 21:54:40 I try to use a small tiny bit of jojoba oil and rub it on the inside of the to be and it does me good but I think any type of oil is fine just use a tiny tiny bit
960 2018-03-29 21:54:32 Absolutely not, it's not like a documentary if that's what you implied. Gw kira di awake maksud 'Deepwater Horizon' lebih ke kasus oil spill di Mexican gulf nya BP yg sempet jd filmnya Mark Wahlberg
961 2018-03-29 21:54:27 I see you failed to answer the question. How many oil producing countries are running a deficit? As for your graphic...over the same period Norway received £17Billion from their oil extraction,but you're saying Scotland owed money...gross mismanagement by UK
962 2018-03-29 21:54:26 To check the oil you literally unlatch the driver’s seat and flip it forward to reveal an engine access hatch. Video gold!
963 2018-03-29 21:54:15 I’m always in such a good mood after an oil change
964 2018-03-29 21:54:14 You were all amazing very brave and inspirational Linda needs to get on the cannabis oil look at that lady in Ireland who gave it her son in hospice with days to live now a healthy teenager a lot to be said for it #tryanything  lots of love x
965 2018-03-29 21:54:13 Lol @rambia it tastes like cooking oil really?
966 2018-03-29 21:54:07 About to go change my oil
967 2018-03-29 21:53:57 There is nothing huge about it. The data they used had not impact. They're snake oil salesmen. And they used it the way FB do, their only violation was not to have paid FB $s

971 2018-03-29 21:53:38 Prepare your bobby pins and oil sheen @Captain_Obvio!
972 2018-03-29 21:53:38 The boy changing my oil is so fine and then he asked for my name and number and I was hyped and then I realized it was just for my contact information for when my car was done and now I'm less hyped
973 2018-03-29 21:53:35 Currently at the car dealership awaiting an oil change for over an hour now. Got me thinking, which would you rather experience?
974 2018-03-29 21:53:27 Weirdly the knowledge that they’re not entitled to my money hasn’t done anything remotely like that.
975 2018-03-29 21:53:09 I just assumed you were part of the oil industry, because to you, everything they do is great and everyone who criticises it is wrong.   My bad.
976 2018-03-29 21:53:01 Did you notice Trump basically admit today that W attacked Iraq for the oil and that if Obama had simply taken over their oil production there wouldn't have been an ISIS?
977 2018-03-29 21:52:55 Goes to the dealership for an oil change & I now want a new car 
978 2018-03-29 21:52:42 "Iiiiiii caaaaaaare""" in mY Beyoncé voice  your music is amazing can't wait to hear the new new, meanwhile I'm still rocking to Coconut Oil!!!  @lizzo
979 2018-03-29 21:52:20 Its not about you.
It’s about what your child wants to do with their life.
It’s not like a dish you can send back at a restaurant. If you want to support. Support. Don’t make it about you getting something for the money.
It’s your kid. Their life their choice.
980 2018-03-29 21:52:11 We been working on it for 17 years in Afghanistan. Time to get out of the Middle East. Drill our own oil and worry about US.
981 2018-03-29 21:52:08 And i just got hot fucking oil in my eye
982 2018-03-29 21:51:46 I agree!!! I can go over to @shophoneyrose and get their gold body oil for WAYYYYYY cheaper lol
983 2018-03-29 21:51:36 I have a new recipe idea! Eggs poached in pesto instead of tomato sauce. <3 It sounds so damn good. With a drizzle of olive oil over it all.
984 2018-03-29 21:51:35 It’s so pretty outside like wtf I wanna be in a tank & shorts drenched in coconut oil, coffee in one hand and joint in the other feeling the sun on my skinnn
985 2018-03-29 21:51:28 However I wish this on no man I hope everything works out and you’re all happy and prosperous
986 2018-03-29 21:51:15 I got asked like 3x that if I know my oil change is going to be over $100 like y’all never see me here before 
987 2018-03-29 21:51:10 Well duh who doesn’t like free money and I don’t know your kids so maybe they’ll pick a major that you like and hopefully everything works out but If they want to do something you don’t like and you stop supporting them it’s gonna Damage the relationship
988 2018-03-29 21:51:10 You know what would be weird? If Russia meddled in the election for Trump to lift the sanctions for oil/gas deals AND the sanctions just happened to be lifted. It would almost seem like Trump was completing his end of some kind of pre-arranged transaction. What a coincidence!
989 2018-03-29 21:51:01 He had the best time! Got lots of attention, got on the telly, got to slurp veggie oil and got some face licks in at the end. An honest days work by the little guy!

992 2018-03-29 21:50:32 @ROCKYBOIMAN50 It really depends on the type of oil being used in the engine. I would recommend contacting the manufacturer as to their recommendations for how many miles before you should change your oil

995 2018-03-29 21:49:50 I put vitamin e oil in mine and good as new
996 2018-03-29 21:49:39 My #pharmacy24 involved cannabis oil too (discussing not consuming) - be interested to hear what your discussions on the subject were. Seems to be very commonplace amongst cancer patients despite no info on safety / drug interactions.
997 2018-03-29 21:49:24 Ah but you’re forgetting the science based evidence doesn’t back up what some guy on YouTube said about vaccines and hemp oil so it is clearly a big pharma con.
998 2018-03-29 21:49:09 WM saw NS oil and gas as a means to provide inexpensive and reliable energy to UK businesses and homes; used taxation revenue to reduce corporate and personal taxation. Will leave the urinating on walls to you, thanks.
999 2018-03-29 21:49:07 Feel them! Feel my hands! It's the snake oil that makes them so soft!
1000 2018-03-29 21:49:01 I’m glad you’re not my kid. My actual kids are grateful for my help.
1001 2018-03-29 21:48:56 Thank you very much, I missed the delivery date when reading the article. Timing wise, they must know the April and May season is big inventory draw months, so your observation is 100% correct - micro managing the price of oil by Trump administration.
1002 2018-03-29 21:48:20 How is my refusing to pay for something I don’t believe in pulling the plug on anything?
1003 2018-03-29 21:47:59 Can't wait to be off Sunday imma sleep oil day
1004 2018-03-29 21:47:53 They're going to do everything they possibly can to set us back decades because they love money that much. They're old white rich men who're all in on guns and oil and chemicals. They'll all be dead soon and have nothing to lose. Screw Mother Earth, it's all about the benjamins.

1006 2018-03-29 21:47:46 The Syrian war if you think about it eventually you realise it's all about oil...and foothold in the middle east....power and greed
1007 2018-03-29 21:47:33 I knew.
Did a little geography.
Dallas, Houston.
Oil, and cattle.
Kind and generous with big hats.
Same size as France.
About half the population of the old country.

1009 2018-03-29 21:47:21 Now Lust Oil from Jade & Fox Co. will really have you glowing! 
1010 2018-03-29 21:47:12 Si, por las noches soy menos diplomático, jajaja. En el fondo stamos de acuerdo, pero lo de la 'viabilidad' y 'racionalidad' es siempre relativo... los científicos nos dicen que vamos muuuy retrasado en la descarbonización. Carbón y transporte (oil) son los grandes enemigos.
1011 2018-03-29 21:46:52 The $92 Million that went to Alberta was many decades ago before discovering oil and gas. So we're pretty much 0% and 0% of any number is still 0.

1015 2018-03-29 21:45:59 3) Nobody said anything about RE-negotiating. Why would Iran renegotiate a deal that was already made? Other deals could be discussed.
4) The #US is Saudi & Israel's bitch. + oil. Those are only reasons #US is involved in the Middle East. Stop pretending it's for anything else.
1016 2018-03-29 21:45:52 I’m being supportive by paying at all.

1021 2018-03-29 21:45:20 All I’m saying is that I’m glad my parents aren’t that controlling and more supportive
1022 2018-03-29 21:45:20 Why should I spend several years of my income on schooling I think is not worth the money? I simply won’t do that.
1023 2018-03-29 21:45:06 Most violence is against men. Men do the important jobs women won’t. Cleaning sewage, building roads, train tracks, oil riggers and laying power lines.
So you can spout your man hating bullshit in the comfort that man built for you and me.
1024 2018-03-29 21:44:58 Or perhaps the arrangement from the get go was to falsify this story to distract. I mean does anyone know China has completely tied currency to gold and now oil. Remember people THEY came to @POTUS ..wouldn't have if there was anything to take him down....white hats distract two!
1025 2018-03-29 21:44:49 So, don't need oil eh? Then I would suggest, turn off your phone, tablet, computer, get rid of all oil based products in your life and go live in a cave. Here's an idea, ship all the enviro freaks to deserted islands, so they can have their safe clean place. #misinformedsheeple
1026 2018-03-29 21:44:37 I build in stages. Stir as you go. No orange oil? Skin an orange over the glass

Edmonton: 2015 (Eskimos), 2005 (Eskimos), 2003 (Eskimos), 1993 (Eskimos), 1990 (Oilers)

I'd say they've got you there. Even if you count the Oil Kings in 2014!

1033 2018-03-29 21:43:42 I feel that way when I gotta get my oil changed or any other car repair 
1034 2018-03-29 21:43:41 I’m not sure it’s awful if as a parent with limited resources and an exhausting career that I set limits on what my money is used for. Frankly. I could simply say “no” to paying for school at all and retire several years earlier.

1046 2018-03-29 21:41:15 I was talking about how I wanted an oil diffuser and I went on amazon and everything and was gonna cop but I was like na ill wait, then a package gets to my house and it's it, but I dont have any charges on my card.... 
1047 2018-03-29 21:41:11 Why #Macron didn’t defend Kurds in Iraq when Iraqi army attacked them and took 50% of Kurdistan. It’s because France needs Iraq for oil and reconstruction contracts and weapons. He's not courageous, he’s a liar. All the politicians are liars and don’t make heroes of them, s-il-p
1048 2018-03-29 21:41:01 it’s between that and gun oil

I didn’t *intentionally* tell the oil industry to brainwash me. They just went ahead and did it.

Then they bribe Congressmen to go against my best interests. 

That’s not democracy.
1061 2018-03-29 21:39:08 Thank you for the heads up! Will make sure to get some more coconut oil so the host is all moisturized

1063 2018-03-29 21:39:04 Someday I'll tell you the real story behind oil and the Viet Nam war.  Interesting connection between DeGaul, Truman, Rockefeller, Giao, Ho and Royal Dutch shell over the Indonesian oil leases controlled by Sukarno the Indonesian PM.  "O what a wicked web we weave".
1064 2018-03-29 21:38:59 @BraveTart Hi! My nephew doesn’t like coconut in any form (poor baby). Can I sub regular coconut oil for the virgin CO in your WMLCake without affecting the crumb?
1065 2018-03-29 21:38:56 I was going to get that but remember when you gave me the olehenriksen vitamin c serum + night cream samples with the peter thomas roth mask collection. I remembered how much I loved it. Sidenote: mario badescu's vitamin c oil serum is the only oil one that was worth my money
1066 2018-03-29 21:38:56 "Taking the oil," apart from being a war crime, makes absolutely no sense. Does it mean de-nationalize the Iraqi oil industry (nationalized in 1972)? Export the oil by force, with tankers etc.? I would be more inclined to interrogate this idea if it wasn't so clearly insane

1069 2018-03-29 21:38:30 "Oil Tot" that live stream was truly EPIC! I loved it and it cheered me up from a very depressing day. So your stream affected me in two positive ways. You once again lead me to be interested in yet another game (haven't forgotten about Life is Strange) and it was a cheer up!
1070 2018-03-29 21:38:20 I KNOW.  I didn't know it was in the ingredients.  We usually watch for palm oil stuff.  My fault for trusting.

1080 2018-03-29 21:37:18 I think that works, ironically, with the NRA—everyone chips in their $40 and the NRA uses it to run campaigns; that sounds fair—but ordinarily it *doesn’t* work.

We buy gasoline and heating oil. The oil industry takes all our money and brainwashes us into thinking Climate Change

1083 2018-03-29 21:37:00 You really have no idea how the world runs or where America's been getting most of your oil from do you?

1089 2018-03-29 21:36:04 I find your question odd. We export natural gas and oil, are you saying we should not? When we export those items other nations profit from them too. The same is true of military arms sales. 

Did I misunderstand your question?
1090 2018-03-29 21:36:00 Be ready for worse air quality, spending more for gas, and for what? That translates to higher health care costs, higher costs for goods and services and for what? So oil companies can get higher profits?
1091 2018-03-29 21:35:59 We had the Previa predecessor, an 85 Toyota van, whose engine was even more under-seat. I vividly recall peering over the upturned driver seat and the heat coming off the motor as my dad added a quart of oil. Also ours had a center console ice maker and a ginormous rear sunroof.
1092 2018-03-29 21:35:53 Why is it so satisfying to put your head down on paper and look at all the oil absorbed

1103 2018-03-29 21:34:37 How come everytime I get an oil change or go to a tire shop, they always leave my car in gear????
1104 2018-03-29 21:34:33 i just found out about the illegal oil refineries in nigeria. the military will find them and then dump oil and gasoline into the oceans, rivers, and all over the land. so that’s good

1109 2018-03-29 21:33:37 Late Yar adua took over governance from OBJ when there was serious economic melt down in this country they did not blame the past govt rather set up strong economic team and eventually revived it.

1113 2018-03-29 21:32:46 I don’t think Russ will be all that hurt. Trump is campaigning for the GOP’s life. If they fall in Nov that will slow everything down, including the possibility of oil flowing thru that KXL Pipe. Dems/Obama were the ones who stopped it. They still could.
1114 2018-03-29 21:32:37 Having a car is all fun and games til it's time to get the oil changed, inspection, get an alignment, all that. wear & tear be adding upppp

1116 2018-03-29 21:32:23 A resource is only a resource if you know how to extract it, use it, and market it. Africans had access to diamonds, oil, coal, etc, for thousands of years, but they weren't resources for them.

1122 2018-03-29 21:31:38 Ah, now we are getting somewhere! Really good point - increasingly true as we get more and more data but less and less insight. 

And as with oil, water, etc. - it is the refinery where the real value is.
1123 2018-03-29 21:31:31 @GoFarCar installed in the company fleet for FBT reporting period which is about to end.

1142 2018-03-29 21:28:23 Thanks for letting us know the right-wing Liberal government said thanks to Trump for approving another disgusting oil pipeline.
1143 2018-03-29 21:28:18 It’s slow, the food taste like burned oil come to mine
1144 2018-03-29 21:28:17 If data is the new oil is a data breach the new oil spill? Asking for a friend.
1145 2018-03-29 21:28:14 No but just cube em. Some stores sell them that way already. Olive oil, salt pepper and that’s it. I start em on medium for a couple minutes then cut the heat to med-low’ish. About 25 minutes add a 1/2 tsp butter. Kill the heat. When the butter is melted, its’a ready!!!
1146 2018-03-29 21:28:13 That Garnier oil infused micellar water has lasted me 6months, I’m impressed 
1147 2018-03-29 21:28:05 Like oil or a pill??
1148 2018-03-29 21:27:39 i’m about to sit in the bathtub w some scented oil, w a glass of wine in my hand and my bio book in the other .
1149 2018-03-29 21:27:37 They were so bothered that they didn't even fill in the templated message section. Obviously they had more important things on their mind, like "what beard oil should I use?"
1150 2018-03-29 21:27:31 Seriously,  who doesn't just love 15 to 24 year olds shouting at them?? Nobody I know.
1151 2018-03-29 21:27:28 I'll get the oil :^)
1152 2018-03-29 21:27:28 Trains still moving around here ..... but big surprise I only see oil and Walmart freight moving on them @johnsonthree @ipoliticsca
1153 2018-03-29 21:27:25 Parce qu’avec la fiscalité gaz oil et taxes autoroutières plus social conducteurs, elle taxe encore plus sévèrement les poids lourds que les pays que vous évoquez et bénéficie même d’un excédent confortable sur le piste routier
1154 2018-03-29 21:27:16 Had to be an adult today and pay for all new brakes and an oil change plus paid two weeks of daycare and have to go grocery shopping tonight. I don’t even want to look at my account.  Not to mention my cats vet bills I’m paying tomorrow morning
1155 2018-03-29 21:27:14 Most? How much water do you think is used in fracking? Refining gasoline? Same enviros that after there is an oil spill realize having a biodegradable product diluting it is a better idea. Or they want cleaner air... water...
1156 2018-03-29 21:27:12 Yh I don’t think I can justify the Fenty shimmer  I’ll get the pom and The Body Shop shimmer oil instead.
1157 2018-03-29 21:27:10 Ah yes, the oil
1158 2018-03-29 21:27:00 Tea tree oil on your scalp is so therapeutic 
1159 2018-03-29 21:26:29 Oshey boss more oil for the days ahead .

1162 2018-03-29 21:25:45 He's never been more than a snake oil salesman and as such, he lied, deceived, and swindled the vulnerable uneducated masses. Unfortunately, everybody - including those who didn't bought his fake remedies - is now suffering the side-effects of his pernicious influence.

1168 2018-03-29 21:25:20 Light oil? I went to culinary school to become a food doctor, you best be using EXTRA VIRGIN and SEA SALT.
1169 2018-03-29 21:25:14 It was what that drumed up war was abt in the 1st place..BushCheney take control of the oil and bam the war would pay for itself. #Crooks

1174 2018-03-29 21:24:45 You can find it in all good chemists, next to the snake oil.
1175 2018-03-29 21:24:44 LOWER HIM INTO A VAT OF BOILING HOT OIL...ONE INCH AT A TIME... FEET FIRST.
1176 2018-03-29 21:24:37 Does Donald pay his fair share of taxes? Where are his tax returns? He bragged he was smart not to pay. And Amazon does pay taxes unlike the big oil and energy companies Trump gave major tax cuts. Some of them even got millions in rebates.
1177 2018-03-29 21:24:31 Have you tried using coconut oil on your ends?
1178 2018-03-29 21:24:29 So I ask are we giving our oil to Russia just asking
1179 2018-03-29 21:24:27 Delish! Mine is kale in food processor to VERY chopped, and almonds and dried cranberries chopped separately, dressing sesame oil, evoo, and lemon juice. Or TJ orange champagne vinegar. Mixes well with leftover veggies.

1185 2018-03-29 21:23:08 I scrub with dish soap to help get dirt off. But if you have a pair just looking to make the boost look good get a White Sharpie Oil Based paint pen. It’s waterproof and really brings that new pop out again
1186 2018-03-29 21:22:58 The drop in oil consumption in Norway will give a very clear signal of where we are heading.
1187 2018-03-29 21:22:56 I went to get an oil change right after working out and I feel quite bad for the poor soul sitting next to my smelly self. So sorry stranger.
1188 2018-03-29 21:22:55 Mineral oil takes off self tan. Grape seed and sunflower oils are going to be your best bet
1189 2018-03-29 21:22:48 Is that the fall in the oil price that you lot gleefully celebrated?
1190 2018-03-29 21:22:48 Seems like a 700,000 barrel oil fire would make it hotter
1191 2018-03-29 21:22:48 When I get an oil change ion give a fuck bout my engine. I just wanna know if they vacuumed my shit good
1192 2018-03-29 21:22:13 You know you’ve spent too much time on YouTube when you end up watching videos about how to bowl like a pro. Did you know there are different types of oil patterns on the alleys ?
1193 2018-03-29 21:22:05 Hahhahah.. ....palm oil...#bbnaija
1194 2018-03-29 21:21:37 A week ago I would have agreed, till I tried a banana bread recipe that used tahini in place of butter or oil. It was damn tasty.
1195 2018-03-29 21:21:33 For some reason, no amount of oil fixes it. Only regular keratin treatments do.
1196 2018-03-29 21:21:08 I dnt know why this your WCW is so hostile...
1197 2018-03-29 21:20:59 Awww My Nina
But wait, is that bronzer or palm oil? #BBNaija
1198 2018-03-29 21:20:46 Perhaps this Bull Moose Party member needs to approach the oil companies, tell them to take the high road and “save education” (good PR) with a 7% GPT and then threaten that it’ll be 10% on the ballot in Nov. They’ll say: “Where do I sign?!”

1201 2018-03-29 21:20:32 I see a country protected by oceans that had vast national resources and an immigrant population willing to work and sacrifice fueled by lots of coal and oil...and more injustice than most Americans care to admit.
1202 2018-03-29 21:20:10 I’m so ready to get everything on my car fixed, oil change included.
1203 2018-03-29 21:20:05 Months ago you said ISIS was dead. No more. Now you are saying we are knocking the hell out of them. You surely talk like a snake oil salesman. You sell products before they are even invented.

1207 2018-03-29 21:19:33 So is he willing to give up our oil to Russia sounds like it.
1208 2018-03-29 21:19:22 When you steal Democratic elections what is a little free oil?
1209 2018-03-29 21:19:12 Gotta be a better way to cool a house than to burn a barrel of oil. 

C'mon, guys! Use your heads.
1210 2018-03-29 21:18:50 I clean mine with dawn dish soap and a bit of olive oil
1211 2018-03-29 21:18:47 Omg they have hair and body oil it’s a wrap 
1212 2018-03-29 21:18:29 So I just came to go get my oil change first thing nigga said when he looked at me was “you got time?” lmao well damn
1213 2018-03-29 21:18:15 So how many employees do u have in your little book store? Read what Standard Oil did to it's competitors.  R  bigger companies always better?
1214 2018-03-29 21:18:09 the crown prince since day one in office said " we are addicted to oil in the past decades, we have to build sustainable economy without depending on oil as one resource " although we still have a huge reserves, he's planning to change as a part of KSA Vision 2030 that's all 
1215 2018-03-29 21:17:54 Funny, I once wore an eye patch and went to grad school @georgiatech. But neither of us had a reason as cool as Wiley: a piece of hot steel flew into it on an oil rig when he was a roughneck. Used workman’s comp to buy his 1st airplane. Rest is #history.

1230 2018-03-29 21:16:34 Middle Eastern oil industry. 

The US gets most of it's oil from the US, followed by Mexico, and Canada.  

Good cause though. I get the message.
1231 2018-03-29 21:16:11 I respect your opinion but I don't agree with it, to complete the view for everybody wondering about the project it's mainly because we consume so much oil in electricity (which is better to export in higher prices) while there's a deferent resources to supply this growing demand
1232 2018-03-29 21:16:08 @TheScotsman how far behind news is the printed press..? Then this twitter account re-tweets irrelevant stories again and again..

1269 2018-03-29 21:09:51 A handful of MPs from D-faction have indirect deals with Fenaka Corporation for supplying oil to islands. Fenaka supplies oil to these ppl with a discounted rate so they can resell with a profit margin. These cases have to be investigated to protect our economic rights.

1289 2018-03-29 21:06:36 about to shower in thc oil. @_Moggieee
1290 2018-03-29 21:06:34 Been there it's fuckin horrible! Try black cumin seed oil. No sayin it's a miracle cure! Try changing the way you sleep, maybe that's causing it? A good support pillow makes a difference. Never give up! It will pass. You've just no found what works for you. We don't do giving up!
1291 2018-03-29 21:06:28 Matthew 6:17-18  But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face,  so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. #ALDUBLentenGoodFriday
1292 2018-03-29 21:06:27 So Bill Gate's should pick a location,announce a date and share money for us instead of giving the govt
1293 2018-03-29 21:06:21 Tories are reliant on NS oil revenues and City of London financial services, outside of those golden eggs the rest of the English economy is tanking, Brexit will kill the latter of those geese, and their colonial attitudes to Scotland will lose the first.
Just carry on as you are
1294 2018-03-29 21:06:13 “What have ya got goin’ for ya?” Idk this essential oil smells like Froot Loops, that’s pretty neat.
1295 2018-03-29 21:05:50 Setting that aside, it's not clear why the radical take the oil plan would have prevented ISIS to me.
1296 2018-03-29 21:05:46 Considering they had trouble selling the offshore oil leases it only makes sense. They have to force people to use more oil somehow! (sarcasm)
1297 2018-03-29 21:05:41 My Stache was feeling a bit dry and so I used a drop of @beardpilot 'Spicer' Beard oil and oh damn, I forgot how amazing it smells. It really is incredible!
#beard #beards #bearded #beardoil #beardcare
1298 2018-03-29 21:05:35 @RenaNetjes 's definition of "murderous dictators." = ANY country leader refusing to bow to NATO aggressors and give up his country's oil. Producing evidence is minor problem, always done by MSF, WH, HRW "independent" "humanitarian" war mongers. Disgusting
1299 2018-03-29 21:05:33 The same deals UK Tory accused snp of buying votes! What a bunch of hypocrites! Give back a pittance the UK government took from Scottish waters in oil and gas
1300 2018-03-29 21:05:22 Are they really proud of them tho? Maybe occasionally after a few bags of rice or kegs of oil. But in the long run, are they really proud of them?
1301 2018-03-29 21:05:16 Hahahaha... there's shaa Oil at d end..
Don't mind me jare...But hey, tiger is a type of cat tho..
1302 2018-03-29 21:05:11 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.
1303 2018-03-29 21:05:06 Smartest thing I’ve probably said is “sage is like coconut oil for energy it fixes everything”
1304 2018-03-29 21:05:05 As far as I’m concerned lobbying of any kind should be gone! No more! We the voters get no say. We can’t pay our law makers millions! Drugs, guns, oil, all of it has more say over our laws than we do. Citizens United was a horrible thing for this country as are lobbyists.
1305 2018-03-29 21:05:02 soo my car needs oil. who can help 
1306 2018-03-29 21:04:53 Again, oil and natural demand is increasing. Canada can supply its Gay Friendly molecules or dictators will sell theirs. Your choice. My morals say sell our Gay friendly molecules. Plus it will help pay for health care. @vancouverpride
1307 2018-03-29 21:04:34 And no amount of Vit E oil will get rid of these scars!!!!!
1308 2018-03-29 21:04:21 No matter -- how would Trump propose stealing the oil? Going in at night, when they're asleep, fill some 5-gallon jugs, then sneak out? He's really, really stupid. But I suppose his most rabid fans love him for it.
1309 2018-03-29 21:04:07 Why every time you go get a simple oil change they try to say something else wrong lol like nigga my shit fine give me my damn keys
1310 2018-03-29 21:03:54 That was no oil spill in 1969- as ordered by a Superior Court judge to investigate what was going on I did travel out there for a whole day and then testified in court, under oath, that the oil was coming a nature source about 12 miles from the nearest oil platform.
1311 2018-03-29 21:03:50 Yep. He talked abt keeping the oil during the presidential campaign. “We should’ve kept the oil!” We go over there,  I’m getting the oil!  As if not “getting the oil” was an Obama failure. Such a nimrod.
1312 2018-03-29 21:03:45 Oil, gas, whisky .... are all private - owned ?  Are you saying the SNP is touting Nationalisation ? Any SNP \ ‘yes’ Link to this assertion ? Any costings ?

1318 2018-03-29 21:02:19 Just fucking with you bro. Other countries dont need to create bitcoin to piss off the fed or hurt the dollar. They just stop buying oil with the dollar. All the countries who do this are portrayed as evil empires in the us media. Pretty dumb/hilarious
1319 2018-03-29 21:02:12 lmaooooooo @ my aunt who posted one of those typical auntie fb threads/"memes" about the health benefits of pure cbd oil. should i tell her orrrrrrrrr

1332 2018-03-29 21:00:57 Guys be extra proud of me. I popped a tire and didn't panic. I made an appointment to get a new tire for said popped tire and an oil change at the same time. All in under 30 minutes.
1333 2018-03-29 21:00:43 Salt and a little oil. Kids won’t eat otherwise
1334 2018-03-29 21:00:43 Shale production & derivatives traders our best hope for oil card.
1335 2018-03-29 21:00:23 They used vegetable oil and DIDN'T EVEN GET IT HOT ENOUGH. Damn things tasted like I was licking a grease trap
1336 2018-03-29 21:00:19 I bought a new shampoo today with „Cannabis Sativa (Hemp) seed oil" in it. Can't wait to try it out.
1337 2018-03-29 21:00:13 Coconut oil is very healthy. It is high in special fats called medium chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently than other fats
1338 2018-03-29 21:00:12 little drizzle of good olive oil... perfection
1339 2018-03-29 21:00:02 We're sentient patches of oil swept along down corridors of shadow. #cyberpunk
1340 2018-03-29 20:59:54 I had to get my oil changed and tires rotated only to find out that i need two new rear tires because of these damn potholes in Michigan
1341 2018-03-29 20:59:33 read an article where someone was referred to as an oil "baron," "mogul," and "tycoon" in the same article! and i felt very jealous so now i'm calling my dad all of that but replacing oil with "uber!"

i am now the daughter of an uber baron, uber magnate, uber titan, etc.
1342 2018-03-29 20:59:17 At the point in my life where scheduling an oil change for my car makes me happy
1343 2018-03-29 20:59:17 You rigged it with oil money, more like :O
1344 2018-03-29 20:59:17 Why NAPA always trying to sell me the cheapest shit for my car... I know my car and others, give me my full synthetic oil and gold filter instead of your cheap ass conventional oil and commercial filter

1350 2018-03-29 20:58:28 This is all BS! Saudi Arabia is where the oil industry is and you really think they'd go to solar. Next thing you know  Musk is going to be posting they'll buy solar panels and battery packs from Tesla.

Who believes this $l-liT?
1351 2018-03-29 20:58:21 No, no, no.  You didn’t lift a finger for ISIS other than to buy their oil
1352 2018-03-29 20:58:04 But it was a build, right?  
Obviously way too much oil being produced, if there is a build. 
Build = Glut.
I like simple things.

1357 2018-03-29 20:57:04 -haha now all that is left is punish Russia economically through sanctions. So they invest in Syria less, USA and its poodles then can arm Isis beat Assad and get oil infrastructure contracts
1358 2018-03-29 20:56:55 So why was the picture taken with the rape seed oil plantation behind him?
1359 2018-03-29 20:56:53 The words grab, oil & gas got my attention. Thankfully, the truth is universal and cannot be repressed for long. We live in a world of smoke & mirrors to accommodate greed and evil.
1360 2018-03-29 20:56:37 I work on my cars and have a OBD2 reader. I got the code and it was what they said it was. It needs a tune and the cars Oil was low and had a leak from the oil pan
1361 2018-03-29 20:56:03 Fuck that. I eat spice like nothing. You don't grow the finest potatoes in all of the world, fry them in the best oil, just to fuck them up by adding a bunch of extra shit to them. You've heard of racial purity? I'm for potato purity. #NoCajun #NoKetchup

1365 2018-03-29 20:55:03 Anyway, hardly any pain in my back or down my leg since I’ve been taking the cod liver oil. At least one thing is going right.
1366 2018-03-29 20:55:00 The RESTORE Act is working as intended: Escambia County just received $1.6 million to help make water quality improvements and Bay County just received funding for a new boat ramp. Proud to have sponsored this bill with Sen. Mary Landrieu to help us recover from the BP oil spill.
1367 2018-03-29 20:54:53 It Happened To Me: Cheap Olive Oil Gave Me Depression
1368 2018-03-29 20:54:30 LMAO!!!!!

1370 2018-03-29 20:54:29 Your dry skin is over compensating for oil and creating more pimples from the excess production of oil, apply a light oil free moisturizer
1371 2018-03-29 20:54:28 Concentrating on Spurs still? Not denying oil won you both trophies, love it.
1372 2018-03-29 20:54:26 HE thinks there is.
1373 2018-03-29 20:54:23 Is there an essential oil to help with rudeness and hatefulness? Asking for a friend.

1377 2018-03-29 20:53:28 my grandmother refuses to call olive oil anything other than evoo and it drives me insane
1378 2018-03-29 20:53:22 Yeah I wouldn’t sign up for that lol. But I’d get some CBD oil
1379 2018-03-29 20:53:20 i can’t wait to move next month so i can finally do some more oil paintings
1380 2018-03-29 20:53:09 "... not just worried about the political consequences. And it was when I returned to the U.N. that I began to try to mitigate the humanitarian consequences of the sanctions. That's when the idea of 'food for oil' was born.''

Do you blame @madeleine or Saddam? Or? 

2/2
1381 2018-03-29 20:52:55 Trump has no morals which we have seen over and over again. If he stole their oil that would be another crime that seems so natural for Trump to commit. He’s s crook through and through.
1382 2018-03-29 20:52:49 I can’t imagine what it would be like to have to rely on my parents savings to get my university degree for one thing, but it must be outright awful if parents abuse that to force their children’s choices.
1383 2018-03-29 20:52:38 @officialmcafee. Hey John, what the miners are doing with this low bitcoin price? Will they decrease the  bitcoin supply they mined as the OPEC do with oil when the price sink?Cheers
1384 2018-03-29 20:52:23 That reminds me. I need an oil change, which I normally do myself.
1385 2018-03-29 20:52:15 so i was casually putting tanning oil on by the pool and i had to loosen my swim trunks a bit to get my lower abs and i glance over to see a boy full on staring and he didn't even look away when i made eye contact
1386 2018-03-29 20:52:14 Trying to fit getting my nails done, a car wash, oil change, and trip to the gym into the rest of the day. 
1387 2018-03-29 20:52:08 What you are talking about is like tuning an engine's fuel efficiency while you have the oil sump plug undone... fuel efficiency won't matter a damn when the oil runs out and she seizes.

As per CO2 efficiency in the face of decreases in plant available moisture & temp increases
1388 2018-03-29 20:52:04 Baba mi, oil de your head!

You could feel the pain from that chorus. And also on his verse on 'Land Of Promise'.
1389 2018-03-29 20:51:56 I guess everybody isn’t able  just rub a lil castor oil in it. 
1390 2018-03-29 20:51:51 Snake oil salesman @realDonaldTrump .  How does anyone believe this lying creep...
1391 2018-03-29 20:51:39 @GhoshAmitav are you familiar with Venezuelan oil novels? Unfortunately, most haven't been translated, but I believe several of them (unwittingly, since some of these are from the 30s!) engage with what you've written about in regards to the oil novel.
1392 2018-03-29 20:51:39 Already a devotee of Omega 3. As a post- war baby, I had cod liver oil every week when very young. Brain cells in high order.

Nuclear can provide power, desalination, central heating and industrial hydrogen.

1399 2018-03-29 20:50:21 I don't agree. There are more jobs in renewables.  That is a fact. Texas, the big oil state, generates more jobs in renewables than in oil now. We have to come out of the dark ages and get our share. Pipelines are ancient
1400 2018-03-29 20:50:04 Photos from Chrism Mass.  Charles Pullman and Penny York, both Catechumen, carry the Oil of Catechumen to Bishop Stika.

1401 2018-03-29 20:49:55 Good - if there's evidence it needs to be taken further. If you think I'm a Hillary supporter you're wrong. One doesn't need to be a Hillary supporter to know Trump's a snake oil salesman monetising the Presidency to line his own pockets.
1402 2018-03-29 20:49:51 It isn’t our forte. You wouldn’t happen to have any oil, would you?
1403 2018-03-29 20:49:50 the work of dropping oil prices, expensive wars in Yemen and Syria, and high unemployment.  needs jewi $$h support
1404 2018-03-29 20:49:31 Trump wanted to take the oil from Iraq, so Mr Counterpuncher should have no prob taking the money from Russia.
1405 2018-03-29 20:49:29 It would halt all gas and oil exports to Europe; which is a thing.
1406 2018-03-29 20:49:27 Maxwell just said "you know when you get a simple oil change but it comes out to a thousand dollars cause everything is broken" LMFAOOOOOO HES SO FUNNY

1412 2018-03-29 20:49:15 spell oil ??? bwhahahhahaha
1413 2018-03-29 20:49:08 Ah. Can't help you there, lol. Do you dislike olive oil also, then?
1414 2018-03-29 20:49:06 IMO yes.  That was when Russia & China 1st started dabbling in CNY oil, & when China opened SGEI "gold window".  De-dollarization of oil markets began driving USD shortages in Russia, Ecuador, Venez; ironically neg USD move NT drove ripping USD short squeeze rally
1415 2018-03-29 20:48:57 Kudos to #Ghana’s Min of Energy & @Mohamedaminadam, dep min of Petroleum for their commitments, we still have unfinished business to ensure total transparency, still work in progress!

1417 2018-03-29 20:48:52 Sure is comforting to know there'll be another board member of Continental Resources (Big Oil) sticking around to deny academic research tying fracking to man-made earthquakes and allowing OU's mental health training clinic to close while building new luxury apartments instead.
1418 2018-03-29 20:48:46 Having to get my grandad to change the oil in my car, on the basis that with my intelligence I'd probably end up putting sunflower oil in it

1420 2018-03-29 20:48:28 Is coconut oil good for heartache? Or is it tea tree oil?
1421 2018-03-29 20:48:20 Obama was corrupt how? Was he profiting off his presidency? Appointing lobbyists, financiers & oil executives beloved by Russia to his cabinet? Engaging in nepotism, paying hush money to porn stars? Having several of his appointees plead guilty to federal crimes? Enlighten us.
1422 2018-03-29 20:48:16 They’re “sticking to policy”. Whatever. When I wrote the last tweet, I had just entered my mechanic’s shop, and now I’m sitting in my car with the oil change complete. God bless Mr Santos.

1427 2018-03-29 20:47:18 Do this,  AND team up with Suadi's and us canadians to manipulate the price of oil, there for crippling russias joke of an economy.
1428 2018-03-29 20:46:59 , just produce electricity using oil, its simple. There is nothing you need to do your best.
1429 2018-03-29 20:46:54 Nope, I made a guess based on: (a) Saudi Arabia’s main source of wealth in the 20th century has been based on oil export and, (b) now Saudi Arabia is investing heavily on solar power. Based on that premise, my conclusion (oil is about to run out) seems reasonable in my view.
1430 2018-03-29 20:46:51 Is there a correlation, due to the timing, between CB’s no longer supporting US deficits and the oil price collapse?
1431 2018-03-29 20:46:50 Typical LA afternoon - a car wash followed by an oil change. I feel like I should throw in a hike for good measure.

1433 2018-03-29 20:46:34 Call me cynical but I'm getting the feeling that Mr. Hogg thinks this tragedy is his personal gravy train.
1434 2018-03-29 20:46:33 Noooo abeg... why don't you cook with crude oil then? One is cooking oil the other one is gold oil.
1435 2018-03-29 20:46:28 what I do sometimes is experiment with adding things to the peanut butter when I make it at home—it's delicious with a few drops of sesame oil, or with cashews and/or cinnamon/other spices blended in!

1443 2018-03-29 20:45:29 The oil belongs to the citizens of the country it is in. Mr. Trump, please learn how in the hell the world works.

1450 2018-03-29 20:44:34 Under the Trudeau Liberals and Notley NDP the only thing Alberta can look forward to exporting is our prosperity.  

Chasing energy investment out of Alberta pushes it to jurisdictions with friendlier regulatory regimes; oil is still produced but we realize no benefit #ableg
1451 2018-03-29 20:44:30 It's fuckin depressing I know.  But excerises I learnt worked, but you have to keep on top of it. I'm wrong side of 40 and started using black cumin seed oil. Canny swear by it but this battered auld body feels a bit of a benefit. Especially with movement on the bike!

1466 2018-03-29 20:43:16 There’s a whole lot of important information the Liberian people needs to know about the oil contracts, blocks and the management of the oil sector. The president must act decisively and transparently too.
1467 2018-03-29 20:42:59 I sautéed Red, yellow, and orange peppers in olive oil, pepper and Trader Joe’s Chile lime seasoning. Then in another pan I sautéed yellow onions until they were translucent. And then put in the ground turkey w/ more pepper and the seasoning. Combine, top on some quinoa and cheez

No, they’re negotiating oil production cuts together currently.

1500 2018-03-29 20:39:31 The economy will not matter when our waterways are polluted again, our shores are drenched in oil spills and our air is dangerous to breath.   But hey, enjoy the few extra bucks you get in the meantime

1521 2018-03-29 20:36:51 seriously though tell me more. since humans are removing oil from the earth, presumably your theory would say this is causing the earth to warm and would then be, I gather, the "real" cause of climate change. yes?

1566 2018-03-29 20:33:17 Just watched "Not Going Out" where a hairless rat had constipation cured by having anus massaged with cotton bud & olive oil. No way @akkw1803 !!!! 
1567 2018-03-29 20:33:09 You dont look old!!! Evryone has some rebellion in them as a teen..at least I hope...this generation perhaps a tad smug tho...

1573 2018-03-29 20:32:39 Was it visible from Pruitt's first class seat en route to oil barons' meeting?
1574 2018-03-29 20:32:35 Data is not oil because: 
Oil is a finite and single-use resource. 
Data can be re-used multiple times in multiple different ways. 
We should think of data more like infrastructure than a commodity.
1575 2018-03-29 20:32:07 Can we juju on that beat and the baby oil yoga challenge videos are my fav 
1576 2018-03-29 20:32:00 Oil companies, they hate the possibility of losing money in the future.

also me: steps on stylus, almost sits on ipad 24/7, broke laptop screen, always drops my pencils, uses carving tools to open plastic packages, used linseed oil as hand lotion in a pinch once
1579 2018-03-29 20:31:12 Aren’t you the one that accused Hillary of being “all words”? You are full of words! Simple words. All caps words. Random words. It is “All sound and fury meaning nothing.” You are a snake oil salesman and cynical egotist. Really; you are!
1580 2018-03-29 20:31:08 A president saying were about to be out of an oil filled middle eastern country. Never heard that before 
1581 2018-03-29 20:30:50 Tastes like* garbage lmao
1582 2018-03-29 20:30:40 Who cares?  At least they're trying to slow down the destruction oil companies are causing.
1583 2018-03-29 20:30:34 Russia is almost Debt free and they got more oil then us and more gold then us. Good luck .
1584 2018-03-29 20:30:31 Just drop the price of oil for a few months...
1585 2018-03-29 20:29:54 ppl act like this 1 day protest will drastically change prices...the world revolves around money whether we like it or not...these oil companies have enough capital to strong arm the public into eventually having to get gas at some point without decreasing their price on gas lol
1586 2018-03-29 20:29:34 This corrupt rotten oil bought rogue needs to go. Living off an oil lobbyist is a conflict of interest. Pruitt belongs in jail. In the meantime he must RESIGN.

1589 2018-03-29 20:29:28 No it's not acid drilling, it's called acidisation which is a tried & tested technique that's been used safely for many years to optimise the production of oil & gas which  supplies us with  energy to meet our requirements.

1597 2018-03-29 20:28:25 That county might’ve had running water before we fucked it up & gave its people a reason to start making bombs; to defend themselves from over eager & confused soldiers who had been lied to in an effort to secure oil. Admittedly, I’m no expert. Your post is trollish & illogical.
1598 2018-03-29 20:28:23 Exactly.  The president wants us to go back to the 50’s. Bring back coal, start sending letters instead of e-mail drill for more oil.
1599 2018-03-29 20:28:16 One more day in the oil patch and I’m out!

1603 2018-03-29 20:27:35 What a surprise! Fraud of the Oil Companies
1604 2018-03-29 20:27:29 That explains the shortage of coconut oil everywhere.
1605 2018-03-29 20:27:27 $50 for an oil change is too high
1606 2018-03-29 20:27:27 What do we have to do to get some oil?

1610 2018-03-29 20:26:58 #Trump said right. #ISIS has been created with #PetroDollar and continues to survive with the same #PetroDollar.The question is, who put these oil dollars into them.?
To answer, just look at which Arab countries in the region have the highest oil revenues.

1611 2018-03-29 20:26:48 Pruitt works hard to repeal regulations on big oil and gas businesses. Over four million people around the world die every year due to poor air quality. Money is more important to Pruitt than human lives.
1612 2018-03-29 20:26:48 Exactly how many more decades of oil extraction does Alberta need to be in the black? Seems the real profit from Alberta oil leaves the country with multinational corporations.
1613 2018-03-29 20:26:07 Sorry for all the oil tweets but like damn, I love potions and I didn't realize how much some cute little bottles of weird stuff would help my health and mental well-being

1616 2018-03-29 20:25:42 I'm not sure that's true; in fact I'd be surprised if a Central Bank anywhere in the world ever talked about gold.  Rather, CB's would need only intervene in markets to guide the Gold/Oil ratio higher over time & let markets do the rest
1617 2018-03-29 20:25:39 

I just want what's best for my country.
1618 2018-03-29 20:25:37 Wake up please. Why is the US occupying 1/3 of Syrian territory (rich with oil)? They are looting the oil from the Syrian people. Syrian army found 40 tonns of chemical weapons left in Ghouta. Who provided these to the terrorists?
1619 2018-03-29 20:25:22 Any day now, @davidhogg111 is going to be in the position where he’s the one that must apologize.

1635 2018-03-29 20:23:52 I'm also a chronic suffer. Meds also haven't worked for me. Lots of small things make me more comfortable though. Peppermint oil on my temples, cold rag on my neck (even better if you can run your hands under hot water at the same time), massages...
1636 2018-03-29 20:23:47 I will gladly pull out the c*ncer card if someone tries to play me over @kashmirVIII's oil 
1637 2018-03-29 20:23:40 Forgot to mention that the "shortening" just refers to vegetable oil, like Canola 
If you forget and let it stand too long, you can just put it on the burner to rewarm it a little to remelt the butter.
1638 2018-03-29 20:23:40 t's completely unsurprising to me that the strongest supporters of the #KinderMorgan pipeline on Twitter are:

1655 2018-03-29 20:21:05 What I do not get in these gold/oil/cny/USD discussions is that there are no restrictions in the world at present to buy/sell oil, buy/sell gold in practically any currency. If you do not like to be paid in $, you can always sell it

1695 2018-03-29 20:16:16 HOUSTON — Two Texas oil companies joined forces on Wednesday in the biggest deal yet in the Southwestern oil patch, one that should add momentum to the rush to produce more oil as prices rise. The creation of a shale-oil colossus HEY spanky no stop this merger???

1697 2018-03-29 20:16:10 Okay I asked my dad if he put oil on the tray before putting the burgers on and he was like oh no I didn’t so now he’s pouring the oil on top. well then.

1704 2018-03-29 20:14:55 Hillary is a howling monster, more savage than Trump who is merely narcissistic and unstable. There WAS no choice. There'd be war for oil either way because the president only does what the corps tell them to do. That's why I didn't vote in the pres election. Same outcome.

1710 2018-03-29 20:14:17 Okay, Jiffy Lube did not have my oil filter in stock. So while waiting for someone to get one for my car they literally washed and vacuumed my entire car. Best. Day. Ever.
1711 2018-03-29 20:14:11 3/ The medical equivalency of what your saying would be like taking some treatment offered in a peer reviewed journal and acting like it could be just as accurate as some home remedy by a known snake oil salesman.

1724 2018-03-29 20:13:20 Disgraceful. His disgust for the West is killing this country. Our bread and butter is the oil & gas industry which the west depends on for jobs and every Canadian should support to drive our economy. Importing Saudi oil is treason. #NotMyPM

1759 2018-03-29 20:08:49 Learned about pistachio oil today. Who would do that to poor pistachios? It is much more humane to create a small mountain of their shells as you eat them one by one.
1760 2018-03-29 20:08:41 When palm kernel meet wetin strong pass am, it must produce oil.
1761 2018-03-29 20:08:24 USG loves Saudis. If KSA dumps US$,love affair over. Oil triumphs over beheading,torture,oppression.

1763 2018-03-29 20:07:47 And yet, 75% of America can't make ends meet, all the while corporations and big investors are raking it in and getting richer. We had a saying back in the Oil bust of the 70's/80's "Mom send more money the job is going to last longer" Same today Spanky.
1764 2018-03-29 20:07:28 Unfortunately can’t count on the Saudi’s to help with the oil card anymore.

1771 2018-03-29 20:06:39 1.7 million high school students use e-cigs.. Wonder how many are actually vaping the "good" oil?!
1772 2018-03-29 20:06:33 I wonder how many convicted ‘drug dealers’ that Trump/Sessions speak of, I wonder how many of them are actually moms with sick kids bringing enough medicine across state lines (CBD oil) for their own family  as well as families around them who also have sick kids?
1773 2018-03-29 20:06:26 Oil is already running out in lighter

1774 2018-03-29 20:05:58 Jk use a vibrating brush instead of your hands because when you use your hands you just rub the oil from your face everywhere. And I use the clinique acne line. They make a "male brush" too since your skin is different
1775 2018-03-29 20:05:58 The fact that you're proud of the lying your daughter does, to try to justify a bad person, shows what true hypocrites evangelicals really are. 
But thanks to snake oil salesmen like you, atheism is on the rise.  Kim Davis?! Really?! You are a flawed man sir.

1777 2018-03-29 20:05:31 I did it! I finally made some peppermint patty fat bombs to dissuade myself from buying Russel Stover's sugar free.

They are mostly coconut oil but otherwise satisfactory.
1778 2018-03-29 20:05:15 No, better place? How about making college free? Eucated innovators can help reshape your infrastructure.

How about instead of coal you use renewable energy? That will help the infrastructure.

How about you stop getting donations from special-interest groups (Oil, NRA)
1779 2018-03-29 20:05:13 Drink TONS of water! Tea tree oil or witchhazel at night and don’t wear face makeup until it clears up! Be religious with this and don’t touch your face and seriously give it a week or two!

1783 2018-03-29 20:05:02 That's it. He stops looking at the teleprompter. It appears he is having a temper tantrum over the money that Congress won't give him for his border wall. My guess is he's learned DOD can't do it. So he says we'll get out but wish we had stolen everyone's oil. Portrait of rage.

1 teaspoon of water 
1/2 TBSP of coconut oil (or less, depending on how acne-prone or clogged your skin is!)

1802 2018-03-29 20:02:57 Who cares about the diplomats. The way to get his attention is to hit the oil and gas revenues that funds his dictatorship.

1833 2018-03-29 19:58:56 I agree that being able to push their agenda of CNY for oil/gold/commodities would be hugely beneficial to them (especially with their One Belt One Road aspirations). I just have a feeling that the debt situation itself might impair their ability to execute as planned

Came together like magic. Science!
1844 2018-03-29 19:57:30 Did you international friendly practices?, have you been to the Niger Delta and seen the kind of pollution by your international friendly practices oil drilling companies?

1846 2018-03-29 19:57:10 The Left: “We want to disarm everyone (except politicians)!”

The Right: “We want to go to war with everyone (if there’s oil)!”

@jordanbpeterson: “Clean up your own rooms first!”

Left and Right: *slides away, embarrassed*
1847 2018-03-29 19:56:51 هههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههه حتى ف المرور عكايشي ما سلم منكم 
1848 2018-03-29 19:56:47 we'll try going further than that, we'll push for a Trillion, 500 Billion is honestly not a lot for an Empire associating the first and second oil producer and the biggest gaz field of the Globe.
1849 2018-03-29 19:56:26 Nothing you wrote is evidence of a scam. It's only saying by your words that zion oil has not made any profit yet. I'm asking for evidence as in provide documents of a real scam.
1850 2018-03-29 19:56:23 Cannabis oil everybody else seems to be on it.. 
1851 2018-03-29 19:56:20 My goal is to have 1 day out of the week dedicated to self love. Oh yes ima be extra as shit. Ima be drawing myself a bubble bath, painting my toes, face masks, hot oil treatments.. ALLLA that. I deserve it.
1852 2018-03-29 19:56:14 How about we chuck "illegal" and start teaching bunkerers cleaner ways of doing business? Structure their activities and tax them? Or is even this too much for the real owners of Oil up up country? #JokersInPower #UnaNeverHalla #SorryJokeNigeria
1853 2018-03-29 19:56:08 I searched the #OpeningDay hashtag on Twitter and one of the related searches that Twitter suggested was "Oil Massage"

What?
1854 2018-03-29 19:56:07 Petro/gas industry wasnt having it. Hell, even seeing the lengths that TIRE companies go through to kill mobility initiatives, petrol guys aint letting that good oil/gas money get lost to electric. But MAN is it crazy what they do with em now.
1855 2018-03-29 19:56:00 Stop it all or just the ones you don’t like? Oil? Coal? Solar? NRA? Churches?
1856 2018-03-29 19:56:00 We are fully equipped to remove an oil tank from your property. Call us today.
1857 2018-03-29 19:55:51 "We build a school. They blow it up. We build a school, they blow it up. You know what we have for it? Nothing… I used to say, keep the oil! If we kept the oil, we would have been okay. If we kept the oil, we wouldn't have ISIS! They kept the oil, we didn't keep the oil. Stupid!
1858 2018-03-29 19:55:51 Just got spaghetti in my oil diffuser, no big deal.
1859 2018-03-29 19:55:31 Thank you for listening and for the kind words!  Chinese debt situation could have an impact if mismanaged, but IMO ultimately it is this debt situation that is helping drive China's hand - being able to print CNY for oil significantly mitigates the risk of their debt situation
1860 2018-03-29 19:55:21 Perhaps they should shut in all their oil&gas wells, facilities along with all usage of oil&gas along with all byproducts. Cūd also shutdown the harbour &all. 
Silly .govs on west coast / 4 some odd reason.
Calif. BC. OR. WA.  All goofy as heck. Gotta be the land of Dimms
1861 2018-03-29 19:55:19 Heaven feels like getting drenched in coconut oil after a cold shower & workout... Or cold beers & good seats on opening day.
1862 2018-03-29 19:55:18 They’re teenagers, ffs. I’m old but I still remember what it was like being that idealistic and idiotic.
1863 2018-03-29 19:55:08 Garshana massage has a different effect than abhyanga, the traditional #ayurvedic massage done with Sesame Oil. While #abhyanga also helps reduce ama, it is calming, while #garshana is stimulating (great for #Kapha!).
1864 2018-03-29 19:55:04 Show me how it doesn't. Since we're ignoring facts now. I honestly believe just because I'm black I could hand you a cup of water and you would try to convice me that it's oil.
1865 2018-03-29 19:55:02 Scott Pruitt is correct.

There’s many, many more fracking operations in West Texas (and many other oil & gas fields).

No felt earthquakes. 

Simply stated, fracking doesn’t cause felt earthquakes. 

BTW: I’m a geophysicist who monitors induced seismicity.
1866 2018-03-29 19:55:02 Yassssss!!!!! Finally...a rose gold body oil!!! Makes me want to curse I’m so happy, lol

1868 2018-03-29 19:55:00 I’m super late but I like the flax seed + castor oil eco styling gel a lot. Idk if I like it better than the olive oil (my favorite). I kinda wanna try them all.
1869 2018-03-29 19:54:57 Shouldn’t have to change the oil, just check to see that it’s full, and staying full after a few drives. Let it idle a few minutes then shut it off and check after it’s sat for another few minutes. I’m assuming you know how to check oil lol idk why i’m giving instructions lolll
1870 2018-03-29 19:54:26 I’ve been doing castor oil treatments for my hair and omg yes
1871 2018-03-29 19:54:24 Attending the Alaska Oil Spill Technology Symposium in Anchorage.  Good program and good turnout.
1872 2018-03-29 19:54:13 If you’re looking for good conversation, you should come on the @BearsBarroom proof podcast. You can talk a little football, shoot the shit, and have a good time. They had @Ky1eLong and @The_Dream99 on this week and talked about Tropicana, olive oil, and aliens 
1873 2018-03-29 19:54:07 My husband loves his beard oil from @younglivingeo so anyone interested in beard oil for themselves or your husband/significant other let me know

1875 2018-03-29 19:53:39 I was bad and put blue cheese dressing on my salad instead of the usual drizzle of balsamic and olive oil. Living!
1876 2018-03-29 19:53:36 Noodles with garlic powder and olive oil aren't bad I think I have a new favorite poverty dish

1879 2018-03-29 19:53:26 Cup need an oil change actavis I love to pour
1880 2018-03-29 19:53:25 My understanding is that burning fuel for heat and transport (mechanical energy) would be most of the rest, with fuel for industrial uses (converting oil and gas into chemicals etc) next largest. 'Heat' here to include industrial processes like making cement.
1881 2018-03-29 19:53:13 Pulled her away from the Cheetos bag finally. Greetings Gods & Goddesses, Peace, Love, An a touch of coconut oil. Asé  @ Na'vi Nuwang Shen

1928 2018-03-29 19:51:56 El peak oil demand también es una realidad, es totalmente cierto que en algún momento la demanda de petróleo se vendrá abajo, pero por lo pronto, tenemos petróleo para rato.
1929 2018-03-29 19:51:50 He looks like a snake oil salesman.
1930 2018-03-29 19:51:49 I’ll need to mix some Beevertowns Neck oil with it to get a nice claggy look...
1931 2018-03-29 19:51:47 I overdid it with the conditioning hair oil. My hair is clean, but looks (and feels) greasy. #hairproblems #greasyhairicare

1934 2018-03-29 19:51:06 Scotland had a referendum and they have almost all the oil fields that belong to the UK. Norway voted to split from Sweden and I don't think the Swedish half voted in that referendum. A theoretical question: If 100% of Catalonia wanted independence, would you allow it then?
1935 2018-03-29 19:51:05 Goodbye TripAdvisor...
1936 2018-03-29 19:51:04 Just got my brakes done, and a oil change. I take care of my shit
1937 2018-03-29 19:50:56  haha! I'm using a calorie app. It's great for giving macro nutrient intake too. I've cut right down on the cooking oil & added fats & ramped up the protein. It's worked a treat. I still eat pretty much everything I did before...except pies! 
1938 2018-03-29 19:50:51 From Trevor Dorrington

The replacement Triple Pump for 45041 was kindly delivered to the Nene Valley Railway this morning by Nick Harpur of Harpur’s Coaches. Replacement gaskets have been manufactured today for the Pump’s Oil and Water Pipework.

1939 2018-03-29 19:50:47 I dont understand all that is brought up by regonizing isreal as what the capital city in the bible, all that should change is ballet voting site lines or maybe change how we approach them about aquiring cheaper oil buys.
1940 2018-03-29 19:50:35 Oil stockpiles rising, 61 billion extra to the military.

Yep
1941 2018-03-29 19:50:20 Oil
1942 2018-03-29 19:50:19 Still haven’t gotten oil for my diffuser smh
1943 2018-03-29 19:50:17 The focus on fraud in EVOO led by US and Aus industry to claim their product superior but fruit fly dimethoate/glyphosate a problem for them too .Every consumer should worry about lipophilic pesticides and BHA in any edible oil..AOOC and IOOC knows this but avoids issue..
1944 2018-03-29 19:50:06 We are looking forward to seeing our wonderful sponsors and exhibitors at #2018TSES. Don’t miss Phoenix Oil Solutions in booth 22! See you next week! #TANYforSafety #TANYTrainsTruckers
1945 2018-03-29 19:49:52 I'm still stressed out where to find a blessing oil and it's almost full moon. Being a witch is complicated. 
1946 2018-03-29 19:49:32 I find taking fish oil after dinner helps as well as eating healthy natural foods and a bit of daily exercise is always a positive as well. 
Good luck! Give her a big one!
1947 2018-03-29 19:49:30 Would you come change the oil in my car?
It needs it..
1948 2018-03-29 19:49:10 i’ve heard castor oil helps!
1949 2018-03-29 19:49:04 Wow, I love coconut oil and this is a great way to take it with you. We love to camp and coconut oil has so many uses that these would be great while backpacking also. I need to find these! #dailygoodiebox
1950 2018-03-29 19:48:54 They haven’t been thinking, “What if we didn’t have to make the world dependent on oil” for 50 years.
1951 2018-03-29 19:48:41 I use sunlight green or liquid. Then mix coconut oil and water in a spritz bottle and spray my hair after drying  it with an old t-shirt,
1952 2018-03-29 19:48:39 Girl yo oil change should be 30 the MOST dont let these people get you say u just need basic synthetic oil unless you got real high mileage

1956 2018-03-29 19:48:15 There’s probably an essential oil for that anyway.
1957 2018-03-29 19:48:12 Just salt, pepper, garlic oil and wild Kefalonian oregano buds
1958 2018-03-29 19:48:12 i need to get an oil change and car wash
1959 2018-03-29 19:48:05 what about coconut oil?

Sharpy xx
1961 2018-03-29 19:47:56 Watching Lorenzo's oil. I don't knkw why they made us watch this movie in science class back in high school
1962 2018-03-29 19:47:33 LOLOL, right. The Oil want to play McDavid less. Do you read your tweets before you hit send? If he could play 40 mins/game every team in the league would play him for 40 minutes.  He's the best fucking player on the planet! In what world do you want to play him less?!
1963 2018-03-29 19:47:31 Oil production is booming throughout New Mexico, and local communities are reaping the benefits.
1964 2018-03-29 19:47:15 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
1965 2018-03-29 19:46:57 Well, thanks for THAT visual of Comrade Tang covered in baby oil 
1966 2018-03-29 19:46:55 Y'all need to remember that the US has no interest in Canadian oil reaching the open market. Because your 3rd largest proven oil reserves are actually theirs. Trump is a disgusting human specimen but, he's not that stupid. Neither was Obama... He opposed it too folks.
1967 2018-03-29 19:46:52 Peep over an hour. It’s a work shower. After you have to oil down then lotion skin care and hair. This is a process. You’re tired by the end

1969 2018-03-29 19:45:50 The oil, gas industry lobby group @API_News comes out swinging against FirstEnergy:  "FirstEnergy’s latest attempt to spread a false narrative surrounding the reliability of the electric grid is nothing more than a ruse that will force Main Street consumers to pay higher prices."

1972 2018-03-29 19:45:34 I need to get up a get an oil change  but I think my body is depressed.... I haven’t stayed in my room this long in a min... usually I’m out the house already by 10am
1973 2018-03-29 19:45:30 Use the coconut oil daily  
1974 2018-03-29 19:45:28 Say what now they just did and FYI this generation extend to adults as well. I know how to even change my oil. Mitch
1975 2018-03-29 19:45:16 The definition may have actually been crafted with the single goal of excluding Pluto--in other words, determining the desired conclusion first, then coming up with a definition that meets that conclusion. It's what oil companies do when they fund climate studies.
1976 2018-03-29 19:45:09 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1977 2018-03-29 19:45:05 Don't use baby oil use crisco spray just for the day. I had to tan for body building competitions 
1978 2018-03-29 19:45:03 How much oil in that plastic, vs the amount you burn if you drive to the pharmacy to pick it up? Let’s focus on reducing the invisible tons of CO2 we emit before worrying about the grams of carbon we sequester as plastic.
1979 2018-03-29 19:44:58 He has always been in bed with the energy and oil companies so we know were his loyalties lie?
1980 2018-03-29 19:44:45 Yes it is. McDavid is worth much more to the Oilers due to lack of team depth, which is on Chiarelli, not McDavid, as compared to Kucherov for instance who is surrounded by great depth.  That being said, I would look to vote for Weller, or Sid, or Marchand this year. An Oil fan.
1981 2018-03-29 19:44:40 And don't let Dept of the Interior cater to "welfare cattlemen" interests & to oil & mining industries & remove populations of wild horses & burros from the public ranges on which they live,  & not in the massive numbers that are claimed by the Bureau of Land Management.
1982 2018-03-29 19:44:29 And he called himself and the others children? So he can call us pathetic fu*#@ers and anything else he wants but if we respond he plays the innocent child card? You know what that sounds like??? Yup, the leftist way
1983 2018-03-29 19:44:23 Crude oil Dec $90 calls getting a lot of buying today
1984 2018-03-29 19:44:00 Thats all bad man. Gtfo of there! Spoke to a lot of guys from texas (oil&gas), they all talk about how much they looooove texas but the only stories they tell sound like what happened to you.

1998 2018-03-29 19:41:56 luckily like.... olive oil is whole 30 approved i think?
1999 2018-03-29 19:41:54 I know, but I’m still disgusted.
2000 2018-03-29 19:41:52 If u think that it is all just coincidence that the Dems are connected to all this then go back to drinking the oil aid. #sheeple
2001 2018-03-29 19:41:49 Well that’s one of many I hope you will be repealing I would say next on the list is to stop unhindered border xing , and Muslim immigration , if we need  more people 1st we need more jobs ,b4 that we need a booming economy so we need the oil field 100% , pipeline to the coasts
2002 2018-03-29 19:41:47 Hi mom yes I have been taking fish oil I bathe in fish oil I breathe fish oil I am one with the fish oil YOU WISH I WAS A FISH YOU ALWAYS WANTED A FISH

2005 2018-03-29 19:41:29 Today I got an oil change, returned my parents cans, and then bought a juul this is 23
2006 2018-03-29 19:41:22 I don’t change my oil, I change my engine 
2007 2018-03-29 19:41:05 I have 3 herbal oil infusions going right now. Another two weeks, and I’ll be able to start testing them. I’m already tired.  And my “completed” back bar will have around 21 products, possibly more. But I need to open my studio before then. I am stressed!
2008 2018-03-29 19:40:52 Jared Kushner, not styling in his prison poncho at this time; instead got the vaseline treatment without the Saudi oil on this deal.

2010 2018-03-29 19:40:35 Well, unfortunately (I had and have family in service) our boys are being sacrificed for oil and money.   Sad state of affairs but what ticks me off is that Trump ran as the anti war candidate.   He fooled me.
2011 2018-03-29 19:40:25 Not normal kids. They are Media Matters' minions. I have a hunch that their accounts are being run by MM.
2012 2018-03-29 19:40:22 Hey Cat Oil & Gas thanks for the follow!
2013 2018-03-29 19:40:16 ブレーキランプ5回点滅、ごま油のサイン。
2014 2018-03-29 19:40:13 But if you got a cut on hand say . Put lime on and it's very good for that sort of thing . And if you put raw lime in a oil drum  fill it half way .then put same with water .chuck the top on and run as it explodes .So Chris feel for you mate as it's not very nice at all
2015 2018-03-29 19:40:04 I’m disgusted.
2016 2018-03-29 19:39:29 Also curious about macadamia and cashew nut oil.
2017 2018-03-29 19:39:26 You can get computers from the Salvation Army and good will. For cheap on eBay. Loaned from school. Govt needs to help poor. Save money by giving less to the rich and cutting the bloated military budget. Subsidies to gas and oil companies. I guess u don’t know any poor.
2018 2018-03-29 19:39:09 It was roe, then quail egg, then shoji with basil and a tiny bit of chili oil. (Also maybe something else.) I will be interested to hear if that's standard!

2022 2018-03-29 19:38:34 “You have oil so you much be rich?”
2023 2018-03-29 19:38:29 I’ve had this problem with my ears  for a couple of years now doc just said oil is all you need, bollocks mine is worse later in the day I could scream sometimes 
2024 2018-03-29 19:38:22 You do realize this only hurts the gas stations and convenient stores not the oil companies!!!
2025 2018-03-29 19:38:17 My lil fro  5 months growth is amazing! Shoutout to wild growth oil drops
2026 2018-03-29 19:38:12 We have oil too, as well as Arab allies with oil. Doesn't mean there isn't conflict because of it.
2027 2018-03-29 19:37:43 He said "We'll be able to get out of certain areas", I don't think US will abandon oil fields. Maybe he is talking about Manbij and some part of the east of Eupharetes
2028 2018-03-29 19:37:31 Let's try to save us both some time. Comparing apples to apples and oranges to oranges, based on the top 5 producing states, can you tell me honestly that on a per unit basis, the Oklahoma oil and gas industry pays the same amount of taxes as the industry does in other states?
2029 2018-03-29 19:37:13 A5: I like my green veggies to have as much of the original flavor so I only add olive oil and roast most of my green veggies. #NationalNutritionMonth

2034 2018-03-29 19:35:58 Buy him some black castor oil
2035 2018-03-29 19:35:30 OUR feud, not just @POTUS' US Govt & EU, others spent well over decade litigating against @MSFT & others Were JD Rockefeller here he would reconstitute Standard Oil and tell govt anti-trust "make my day, punks" Another example of deep state favoring their personal portfolios?
2036 2018-03-29 19:35:20 Screw that, let's eliminate the middleman and give it right to the oil companies, ranchers, miners and loggers!
2037 2018-03-29 19:35:05 I’ve only been home less then 4hrs and I have already changed oil, swept out and cleaned my car...
2038 2018-03-29 19:34:57 Getting your oil changed is literally the biggest inconvenience everrrrrr
2039 2018-03-29 19:34:54 it’s hard but a few things that might help: wigs, braids, and make sure you oil/moisturize your scalp daily. your hair will grow so fast when you don’t mess with it.
2040 2018-03-29 19:34:48 This puppet can say whatever he wants.  The deep state rules and will never leave oil.
2041 2018-03-29 19:34:44 You’ll be sitting in the dealership ALLLL day waiting for an oil change then they come with some other suggestions.
2042 2018-03-29 19:34:35 Thanks, there's probably more fish than potato in the mix, I often make them at work, not so much at home though. A simple breadcrumbing job and whisking of egg yolks and oil, with a glass of bubbly, it will be the perfect Good Friday supper.
2043 2018-03-29 19:34:35 @LBC so what you are saying is that the #NHS has been making #people #vulnerable while #profiting off #products. Now because of the #Brexit you want us to pay for both service n product while you blablabla about your plans about #oil in #Biafra.
2044 2018-03-29 19:34:33 It sinks like olive oil but it is a typical 35-degree liquor from southern Italy (Amaro).
2045 2018-03-29 19:34:13 Not enough gold floating to have continuous purchases of oil, China is just using this gimmick to purchase oil slightly cheaper. You obviously lack insight on how oil is traded globally.

2048 2018-03-29 19:34:09 My favorite part of my day is when Shane and I get ready for bed and he rubs coco butter and skin therapy oil on my belly 
2049 2018-03-29 19:34:06 Just shaved and exfoliated with a sugar + coconut oil + lemon oil scrub. I’M LUXURIOUS! You can’t touch me!
2050 2018-03-29 19:34:04 Kind of disagree...oil & water...bet he’s gone
2051 2018-03-29 19:33:58 To be clearly, I don't think ETH is more or less snake oil than any other cryptocurrency. I come to similar conclusions about every one I look into closely.
2052 2018-03-29 19:33:56 Someone must be driving a bmw with that much oil on the ground
2053 2018-03-29 19:33:45 wangwe is crying,shedding crude oil lmao
2054 2018-03-29 19:33:39 and pics of arabs and oil ,like the champions elect give a fuck what they think
2055 2018-03-29 19:33:30 Idk why they show me where my oil was before and after I get an oil change. I can’t even tell a difference honestly LOL
2056 2018-03-29 19:33:26 And i just found him eating beard oil. WTF?!?!?!?!?!
2057 2018-03-29 19:33:20 Ach a bit a Albas oil up the hooter n plenty chicken soop will do the trick Paul 
2058 2018-03-29 19:33:12 I never got a choice to vote, but I don't believe palm oil is healthy for our bodies. Do you know how our body process palm oil?
2059 2018-03-29 19:33:11 Yes I know the damn Arabs are my European neighbors, their rich oil asses annoy me, their women have respect for them, hot ones to
2060 2018-03-29 19:32:43 Because rumsfeld/cheney promised the war would pay for itself with iraqi oil money.....still waiting
2061 2018-03-29 19:32:25 "BP, bringing oil to US shores."
2062 2018-03-29 19:32:15 Your critique re difficulty writing safe smart contracts was incisive. They made trade offs regarding ease of programming smart contracts with safety of those contracts. 

But to call it snake oil is just tribalism. It’s valuable, it just makes trade offs you don’t agree with
2063 2018-03-29 19:32:14 Govt propping up oil and coal slowed alternative energy growth in the free market.... so the only choice govt sees now... prop up alternative energy... Govt run economies are a vicious cycle. @AP4Liberty understands this.
2064 2018-03-29 19:32:10 So what?! All I care about is he's putting America First by rebuilding our military, generating jobs at a rate no other President has achieved, given me a very nice tax cut, unleashed our energy resources & eliminated foreign oil dependence oil, eliminated O-Care mandate, etc.
2065 2018-03-29 19:32:08 The kid picked a fight without the ability (or defense) to defend himself. That sounds like stupidity to me.
2066 2018-03-29 19:32:04 Rice noodles and steak w/ garlic mint oil I love how these flavors work together :-)
2067 2018-03-29 19:32:02 The others he is speaking of if you look back in history will be Israel they will be the ones to bomb Iran as they did in 1973. The US Will intervene then. Israel Saudi Arabia & UK are all heavily invested in the oil & natural gas that is held by Syria & Iran. Petrodollar baby!
2068 2018-03-29 19:31:36 "non-reponsive"? Both countries had oil. That's the only reason the US was involved so heavily.... during the 1st Gulf war and the 2nd.
2069 2018-03-29 19:31:23 @elonmusk I love what you are doing so I mean no disrespect, but are we just moving the environmental impact bucket to another location from gas/oil to nickel mining and battery waste? Are we addressing the increased battery demand before it becomes as big of an issue as gas/oil?
2070 2018-03-29 19:31:07 These hands are full of scars 
and burns 
and stain spots of car oil 
and smells of cigarettes. 
Your hands are soft 
and soothing 
and healing 
and your fingers look like dandelion petals. 
These hands.
Your hands.
They can never intertwine.
2071 2018-03-29 19:31:04 As I change trains on an open platform, a man with patent black shoes sneezes twice. His shoes are so shiny, like puddles of oil at his feet.
2072 2018-03-29 19:31:00 @NairnsOatcakes hi can you please let me know what makes the palm oil you use in your oatcakes sustainable please?  Thanks!
2073 2018-03-29 19:30:55 15th oil rounds marks come back of Chevron in Brazil, where reputation was stained by Frade oil spill. Four blocks
2074 2018-03-29 19:30:52 love that woman but $60 for 3 oz of body luminizer... idk. u can crush up some wet n wild highlighter, mix it with some face oil/moisturizer and it would look... damn near the same
2075 2018-03-29 19:30:48 Definitely, as there are so many side effects. One of the worst being how medication affects the gut. Is the answer probiotics and tummy lining medications like omeprazole or lansoprazole? Corn oil, additives such as mannitol and sorbitol can be the reason for intolerance.
2076 2018-03-29 19:30:45 Not bitter at all. Fair play to Chelsea and City getting oil money. We are doing it a slightly different way. Some would say the harder, fairer way. Some wouldn’t.
2077 2018-03-29 19:30:45 Medium to full coverage, weightless concealer that perfects, hydrates and blurs, with 12 and 15hours of crease-resistant wear. Is oil free is a lot shades #contest #Flawless @influnsterVoxbox @LauraMercier

2084 2018-03-29 19:29:56 So much healthier than veggie oil #NationalNutritionMonth
2085 2018-03-29 19:29:55 If oil hits $100
2086 2018-03-29 19:29:47 Are those taxis?? Seems like private chaufers, but even so only in a country full of oil. For sure is a USA friend if not, all was already destroyed.
2087 2018-03-29 19:29:40 I love coconut oil #NationalNutritionMonth
2088 2018-03-29 19:29:39 That moment you realize the jacket you wore to work today has food oil stains all down the left side of it.  #thisismylife #ithinkitwaspizza
2089 2018-03-29 19:29:30 For me it depends on my skincare, primer, what I use to apply my base etc like if I use face oil, primer and then brushes + sponge it creases wayyy less than usual lmao

2093 2018-03-29 19:29:05 Does this work w oil's ?
2094 2018-03-29 19:28:45 Theres a lot of money in selling snake oil. That does not make snake oil a worthwhile product.
Eth may have a lot of money in it, but that doesnt give me any confidence.
2095 2018-03-29 19:28:19 His oil was our business. It's why the West was supportive of Saddam and ensured he had power to begin with. We established him as a power in the region.
2096 2018-03-29 19:28:14 I dont trust #Trump|s announcement that US will soon leave #Syria. They just recently expanded their military base in al-Tanf, keep training #PKK-affiliated #YPG fighters and establish new military positions in oil rich Deir Zor province. It stinks!

2104 2018-03-29 19:27:32 A5 olive oil and fresh herbs!!  #NationalNutritionMonth
2105 2018-03-29 19:27:24 Interesting. Tell that to Russia and China who are engaged in this. And tell that to Iran who have been doing this as well. The oil suppliers determine what is realistic. The PetroYuan contract designed so can be settled in bullion. #ButItCantBe!

2110 2018-03-29 19:27:00 It looks like the US will make a deal soon with Turkey and allow its troops/FSA in northern Syria where #SDF #PKK affiliates hold positions with the US troops. The latter will move south towards #DeirEzzour where oil fields are filling the area.

2111 2018-03-29 19:26:59 A5 I steam my veggies or use a wok with a bit of olive oil #NationalNutritionMonth
2112 2018-03-29 19:26:58 That is not entirely true. If there were more refineries here and in Alberta we wouldn't have that problem. Oil is shipped from here to be feigned in  Washington State and the shipped back.
2113 2018-03-29 19:26:51 A5: Good quality olive oil and fresh garlic. YUM! #NationalNutritionMonth

2116 2018-03-29 19:26:27 I said GOOD-BYE to sugar and coffee today :)  

I have replaced that love affair for right now with some well needed dandy blend, brain octane and a drop of cinnamon essential oil.  tomorrow i'll use peppermint or maybe orange?

2120 2018-03-29 19:25:50 Exxon was the absolute winner in Brazil oil round, never spent so much in the country, ~R$ 2,8 billion for 8 blocks. Petrobras, which usually dominate rounds, placed second with 7 blocks for ~R$ 2,2b.
2121 2018-03-29 19:25:42 Okay but even if CHANGMIN upgraded YUNHO from ‘king of the stage’ to ‘YUNHO-HYUNG’ how can he, the one who had Minho in his phone as like ‘oil conglomerates son’ or something, say he doesn’t use nicknames for his contacts

2127 2018-03-29 19:24:49 I do like them either chopped lengthwise and roasted in a little oil or steamed in a little water with tarragon till cooked then add butter on a low heat till melted, dried tarragon is fine though I do sometimes use fresh is I'm showing off.
2128 2018-03-29 19:24:44 Or even in ten years! But they would find the oil they need if we were stupid enough to fight with our western ports.
2129 2018-03-29 19:24:43 Water and oil!

2131 2018-03-29 19:24:39 Dear @altonbrown I have a cast iron question for you that could be very, very dumb. But maybe not. We mostly use sesame oil when cooking with our cast iron. If I cooked for my friend with a nut allergy...would I accidentally kill her by using this pan?

2134 2018-03-29 19:24:18 Cool yes the vegan meats can be good to transition in my opinion or for one off occasions but the oil content blew me away. 
Yes they can have Keto lol I’ll stick to whole foods it just makes so much sense.

2139 2018-03-29 19:23:16 So what does the government owe big business? Big oil? Big telecom? Please enlighten us? When the “government “ is paid by taxes, I believe it does owe “us” people. We should decide how the $ is spent. Not some bought shill. STFU

2145 2018-03-29 19:22:38 Our infra is crumbling, but so is our energy infrastructure... we're still pumping fossil fuel solutions (gotta keep those oil CEOs happy!) instead of catching up tp the rest of the world that are now leading renewables.

2150 2018-03-29 19:22:05 Very good facial oil and body oil. Won't break you out as its non-comedogenic. Has good fats to provide elasticity in skin. Makes my face feel really supple.

2156 2018-03-29 19:21:23 Most (IIRC around 70-80%) of oil production is in SDF controlled territory and Syrian production most likely won't even cover internal demand - so don't expect the regime to have any net oil export.

2166 2018-03-29 19:20:47 How about some really nice bread, olives and balsamic vinegar and olive oil for dipping? Barely any prep and no oven required.
2167 2018-03-29 19:20:40 Lol. You got it wrong, I am not Shia. But the only parties to gain from Assad’s overthrow are Wahabis, oil lobby and Israel. We cannot afford another million to die in middle east. History deja vu. Let us respectfully beg to differ on this and close the topic.

2173 2018-03-29 19:19:53 Incorrect!

Ralph Klein borrowed from the future by using the oil and gas windfall to subsidize 0% provincial sales tax rather than keeping a sales tax and saving for the future.

The current debt is that of Ralph Klein. The deferred bill is only coming in now.

2177 2018-03-29 19:19:11 Do you have all day? FYI, she doesn't actually believe any of the crap she spews. She's a snake oil saleswoman, looking for weak minds.....which means that you are her mark. Good luck with that.

2217 2018-03-29 19:14:13 Thank you Jimboman. The entire oil world wide market is closed tomorrow correct? Or only US is closed?
2218 2018-03-29 19:13:59 Because they are actually connected: to the extent that we get more of our energy from renewable sources (solar and wind, mostly) we will need less and less of our traditional, fossil-based sources (coal and oil). It’s that simple.

I see you were talking about Keto the other day.

2232 2018-03-29 19:11:59 Just so we’re clear. Burnaby refinery shutdown coinciding with decreased supply from US distributor for a certain region is completely coincidental to the gas price spike in said region....but Oil cartel conspiracy is truth. Gotcha.
2233 2018-03-29 19:11:59 When you go to an #oil change place, they will take out your air filter & offer to change it for you for about $20. You can blow it out with an air compressor hose in the early stages to clean it up & put it back. You can buy a new one & put it in for probably about $4.

2245 2018-03-29 19:10:39 Look, I don't know how to girl. But, for future reference, I just scrubbed my entire face with a lip scrub, and then washed off the excess coconut oil, and my face feels amazing. I don't even care if you're not supposed to do that, because it feels amazing.

2266 2018-03-29 19:07:11 Trump is utterly clueless —
Iraq’s oil was not sitting in some huge oil tank we could pump into ships and sail away.
“Keeping the oil” would mean occupying Iraq and operating — and protecting — all the oil infrastructure and pipelines.

2278 2018-03-29 19:06:16 Also saying the US should have stolen Iraq's oil (a war crime I think), saying he doesn't know what a community college is, complaining about money US pays to help defend Korea and taking credit for SpaceX. Can someone please invoke the 25th Amendment on him eventually?
2279 2018-03-29 19:06:12 And Donald Trump wants to open up the US's national parks for oil drilling and fracking, which may include Yellowstone.

Yeah, if it sets off Yellowstone, it's all the talking Cheetos puff's fault.

2284 2018-03-29 19:05:16 Have you tried cbd/cannabis oil too? If you havent i would recommend doing some research on it. Its easier to get hold of in the US than here in the UK but it's proving  effective in fighting cancer in some patients
2285 2018-03-29 19:05:14 No pollution unlike your illegal refineries. Some communities in Bayelsa and Port Harcourt have bee ruined by oil and gas spills.
2286 2018-03-29 19:05:12 From all indications nearly every agency in gov is politicized and rouge. Main purpose is to feed off the public then return the scraps.

2290 2018-03-29 19:05:06 We need a city with more high-paying jobs in industries other than oil or medical.
2291 2018-03-29 19:04:58 Went for an oil change.
Of course they tried to tell me I needed $3,475 more things done. 
 you can rotate them tires, but das it
2292 2018-03-29 19:04:51 When you get a discount on your oil change cause you cute bless
2293 2018-03-29 19:04:51 Climate change. Oil spills. Sellouts to mining and industry. Methinks EPA's plate is full enough without adding "needless distraction" to it.
2294 2018-03-29 19:04:49 i hate all you oil up women and retouch them to look like glazed donut photographers
2295 2018-03-29 19:04:48 You realize Kuwait is another oil country, right? And we were only there because of that? We also had a lot more international support than we did with 2nd Gulf war. Pushing someone out is very different from nation building and occupation that came with 2003.
2296 2018-03-29 19:04:47 And coconut oil!

2308 2018-03-29 19:02:48 “Klien balanced the budget with low oil prices!” 

Stop it, just stop it. 

Oil was not the primary source of resource revenue then. 

What Klien did to “balance the budget” hurt this province and lead us to where we are now.

2311 2018-03-29 19:02:21 Another American (yeah born BC-lives works in US) who’s agenda is to keep Cdn oil and gas from reaching market. A proponent of carbon tax will easily tow the party line. Canada is for sale to foreign interests while we get distracted by Justin #Trudeau’s theatrics. @FairQuestions
2312 2018-03-29 19:02:14 When was the last time you gave your car an oil change?
2313 2018-03-29 19:01:59 Yep the three people who opposed the federal reserve were on that ship, when it sank the federal reserve received the go ahead. David Rockerfeller should have been on that ship but cancelled at the last minute. Convenient seems though he was partnered with Rothschilds in oil...

2342 2018-03-29 18:59:10 It bothers me that the Bush administration, well, "got away with it."

Bush's cabinet of war criminals loathsomely capitalized from 9/11 and used it as the means to their ultimate goal of perpetual occupation of the Middle East in the glorious name of oil
2343 2018-03-29 18:59:03 Oh yeah! Did you jot down the name of it? Neogen White Truffle oil. Happy Opening Day to you girl!! 
2344 2018-03-29 18:59:02 Because we sell our oil to the United States at a deep discount. A pipeline to the coast would allow us to get a fair market price; increasing our revenue from our resource. This will indirectly increase your standard of living, lower taxes, etc.

2408 2018-03-29 18:52:18 Lead us from salvation, pour that oil please.
That’s how we become kings and queens.
2409 2018-03-29 18:52:05 oomf sent me a news article about a little boy who is one of the few people in texas to use THC oil for medical purposes and said "lucky bitch"

2411 2018-03-29 18:52:02 $59 for body oil isn’t that much depending on the ingredients
2412 2018-03-29 18:52:00 @KElectricPk, acc 0400014608597, what it is to do with gas shortage when KE is producing and billing us on petroleum / furnace oil.
2413 2018-03-29 18:51:55 That moment when hundreds of thousands of jobs of the middle class in the south are “fueled” by success in the oil field... my dad included. We talk about big businesses like it’s one big bad guy... when in reality it’s hundreds of thousands of people like us... normal people 
2414 2018-03-29 18:51:54 The paintwork is shiny gloss so would that be oil? We thought we asked for a matte finish but he has his own ideas and hoom has had to nag him quite a bit. Nearly there tho. The front door is undercoated and think we've found a plasterer to skim where the kitchen tiles came off X
2415 2018-03-29 18:51:48 That Chrysler K-Car Sister Sledge are in is like the bloody one I had to push out of the garage on my own every day when I was an apprentice. It had been driven to the U.K from Qatar by someone in the oil business and then blew up when it had run dry of the stuff.

2416 2018-03-29 18:51:37 Oh yeah the Bushes and Texas Oil are also at fault here still.
2417 2018-03-29 18:51:32 There's no capital city, Dubai happens to be famous amongst them all its the centre of business and hospitality, Abudhabi is the rich in oil
2418 2018-03-29 18:51:22 Where would onshore Mongolia fit into the above cost curve? I understand that this is the last onshore oil frontier & indications suggest there is scope for economies of scale in terms of production from multiple fields
2419 2018-03-29 18:51:03 I read somewhere that some weirdo said that Jesus was a drag Queen and was Gender Fluid....I’m confused is that like some Hispanic guy that drinks synthetic motor oil....does he become lubricated rather inebriated  
2420 2018-03-29 18:50:55 Ok so who the hell figures out how to make mayonnaise? Who was like “let’s use soybean oil, eggs, and fucking vinegar for something delicious” like wtf?

2423 2018-03-29 18:50:17 lol, thats bullshit and you (should) know it. Oil wasnt what we made money off then. Record profits in Natural Gas made us what Oil did in its hay day.
2424 2018-03-29 18:50:14 After a statistically significant two-day trial of beard oil, I can report an approximate 75% decrease in beard-druff and an 80% increase in sandalwood aroma.
2425 2018-03-29 18:50:12 @mjsoka Hi Soka, just saw your Ebola TEDTalk...for any viral illness try Oregano Oil capsules, 2-3 three times a day...
2426 2018-03-29 18:50:11 “Statistics Canada cited a 7.1 reduction in oil sands production due to unscheduled maintenance shutdowns.” Let’s makes sure we tell the whole story and not just what you, #KM and big oil want us to hear! #cdnpoli
2427 2018-03-29 18:50:09 So my house is on fire, and an oil company truck pulls up and tells me the best way to put out the fire is to pump oil on it. Never take at face value a solution to any problem that profits those proposing the solution.  Sound familiar? @Everytown @MomsDemand #Enough

2431 2018-03-29 18:49:45 Oil spills aren’t imaginary, but the probability and severity of an event have been greatly exaggerated by opponents. I have seen KMs spill response proposal, and it will actually improve incident response for all traffic in the straight.  So in the risk vs. reward context.....

2439 2018-03-29 18:49:14 It's too bad Sylvester Turner doesn't like oil & gas workers as much as he claims to like the Astros.
2440 2018-03-29 18:49:14 No offence but she is more of a threat to life on the planet than she is a help. She is promoting pipeline oil destined for plastic production but maybe for this....
2441 2018-03-29 18:49:11 Oh, I will never, ever diss Kobe, but the bottom line is that while he is arguably the greatest guard to ever play the game and one of the hardest workers...he WAS an insufferable person at times., And, Howard was lazy as hell while in LA. So yeah, that was oil and water.
2442 2018-03-29 18:49:08 Tea tree oil works like a charm!
2443 2018-03-29 18:49:07 But he has a point. Now Iran has all the oil.
2444 2018-03-29 18:49:04 Went shopping after work because it’s payday and I needed new tights. Returned home with jeans, a jacket, 3 tops, a bra, 3 lipsticks, a concealer, a foundation, 2 eye liners, a lip liner, an eyeshadow, a bronzer, a face brush, hair oil and NO TIGHTS! I have a problem 
2445 2018-03-29 18:48:48 It would be great to see local action by Los Angeles leaders surrounding lowering VMT and banning most oil drillining within the city. Carving out space for bus lanes and bicycles would be a good step in the right direction.

2452 2018-03-29 18:47:38 Many factors why not profitable. Gas/oil fired vs more efficient gas turbine, many new transmission lines over last decade have reduced congestion costs and every third house seems to have a subsidized solar panels on it.
2453 2018-03-29 18:47:36 I'm not jealous. Norway is a great country, with hard working people, and would be okay without it's oil.  I don't know why you feel the need to hate people who are different from you. I suspect you don't suffer from working to hard but affluenza.

2457 2018-03-29 18:47:17 If you want to get back to reality. We DID have infrastructure debt but this is one facet of the entire equation. Under the PCs we didnt save, we didn't diversify, we spent our oil revenues and then took it in the ass when oil revenues vanished.
2458 2018-03-29 18:47:00 Throughout our country's history the greedy mighty & strong who failed to control their greed & attempted to dominate market or slight safety eventually got regulated or broken up by congress or both.

2460 2018-03-29 18:46:51 Is he verifying that Bush attacked attacked Iraq for the oil and that the Obama administration recognized the illegality of that and attempted corrective action?  Who's stupid?
2461 2018-03-29 18:46:44 If Bush ignores international communities, close allies (not some random country with small contribution), to do what he wants with Iraq, what's the point? If it's for profit, it's okay, right? We need oil, nation building, private contractors, etc. and this excuses?

2473 2018-03-29 18:45:22 Wat ik nog steeds niet begrijp is als dit al zo lang bekend is, waarom werken de Westerse regeringen en overheden er zo hard aan mee om dit te bewerkstelligen? Het kan toch niet alleen oil for immigration zijn?
2474 2018-03-29 18:45:09 Because D'Artagnan used too much mustache oil.
2475 2018-03-29 18:45:06 Been blessed twice today. Got my oil change paid for and lunch paid for. God is good. Couldn’t be more thankful for the people I’m surrounded by.

2477 2018-03-29 18:44:33 #morningmusings   "Every turn of the drill counts on the way towards striking oil."   I'm not much for oil dependency, but that was the analogy that came to my mind.

2480 2018-03-29 18:43:57 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
2481 2018-03-29 18:43:57 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2482 2018-03-29 18:43:50 Aleppo pepper is a weirdly addicting spice that finds its way into almost everything I make. Makes a lovely oil as well! 

Perhaps Mr. Flay should look at it as an alternative to his ubiquitous Calabrian ;)

they are so harmful to your system.

try out avocado oil, it’s neutral oil with no flavor & can be used at high heat.

DO NOT use coconut oil to fry things or use at high heat.
that oil doesn’t have high smoke point

2554 2018-03-29 18:37:27 The #PetroGold trade as exists w/ Russia/China is restart trade of gold bullion (not currencies) for oil as was prior to 1970s w/ many ME oil prod'rs. Europe 9M bbl/d (75% total) net import w/ no organic EU prod'n growth. US can ramp. Major, non-linear EU oil price problem. #oil
2555 2018-03-29 18:37:23 .@realDonaldTrump says America should have kept the oil from the Middle East. He said it would have prevented ISIS.

2559 2018-03-29 18:37:12 the US is the #1 importer of Venezuelan oil and was so all through the Chavez and Maduro years. Also the US exports light crude that Venezuela
2560 2018-03-29 18:37:00 That old campaign refrain of Trump saying to "keep the oil" in the Middle East has returned here today, part of a longer riff on spending trillions in the Middle East and not enough back home in the U.S.

2564 2018-03-29 18:36:21 That was correct in 2010 but he restricted it in 2016. I didn’t agree with the expansion although I understood his desire to decrease our dependency on other countries. There’s no simple solutions to some things & oil use & production is one of them. What is your solution?
2565 2018-03-29 18:36:20 Almond oil is comedogenic, that's why
2566 2018-03-29 18:36:07 Like Standard Oil the largest Internet companies have become too large  and yield far too much control, over both government and the people

Breaking  them down under anti combines directives, would be the best solution
allowing competition to drive prices and far more employment

2573 2018-03-29 18:35:13 Yeah, whether it's small scale e-celebs, or the famous assholes who are contributors to Fox News, the amount of con-artists and morally bankrupt snake oil sellers is amazing.

2589 2018-03-29 18:33:08 Can you clean up the oil based mud mess you left in Nigeria. Clean up the North Sea of bentonite, barite and the oil based mud you dumped in the dark. Turning a blind eye to rigs blowing barite into the sea rather than transporting it back onshore. Don’t kid us Shell.
2590 2018-03-29 18:33:08 Your tweet is somewhat undermined by the fact you have fallen for sponsored misinformation / snake oil pushed by Open Britain. 

Their figures are wrong. But don’t let facts get in your way.
2591 2018-03-29 18:32:58 2) trade tariffs, lowering taxes to level playing field, dumping domestic regulations to lure back & inspire US & foreign co's, pushing for 1 trillion in infrastructure, growing oil & gas exports, kicking in a new space race and more.. Aint a nerf ball :)

2683 2018-03-29 18:21:40 If these loans favoured renewable projects more the price would sooner drop enough to not have to rely on subsidies at all, but past governments love the dirty energy too much. The oil industry has controlled a century of politicians in this country but it's time up now.
2684 2018-03-29 18:21:35 How is it going chaps, is he using water based or oil based stuff
2685 2018-03-29 18:21:35 As a Christian and an #entrepreneur, I've been thinking a lot about the story in 2 Kings of the widow who comes to the prophet Elisha seeking financial help. The miracle is that Elisha multiplies her single bottle of oil into a bounty.
2686 2018-03-29 18:21:28 My miraculous healing oil brings all the pilgrims to the graveyard, and I'm like it's better than yours. I could teach you, but I'd have to charge.
2687 2018-03-29 18:21:25 Palm oil special. 
2688 2018-03-29 18:21:25 I usually don't care about getting paint on everything I own because, well, there's already paint on everything I own, but TODAY I got phthalo green oil paint on my white leinenkugel's polo and I will NOT BE HAVING IT
2689 2018-03-29 18:21:13 1/ I wash my hair once every 3 showers, & rinse each shower between; coconut oil (OGX brand - at Target) shamp & cond. Once in a while I use a leave-in conditioner. Post-workout is same as above. Post-shower: leave hair in towel as long as possible. Wide tooth comb, air dry.

2695 2018-03-29 18:19:50 Try coconut oil three times daily
2696 2018-03-29 18:19:47 Should all oils be refrigerated once opened or only nut oils? I guess I’m worried about oil becoming rancid #atkquestions

2700 2018-03-29 18:19:10 The info was crap. David Kelly wasn’t able to report the truth Cos he died before he could Paul. The whole thing was a smokescreen of lies so Bush & Blair could kill Saddam and get the oil. Which they did and still do.
2701 2018-03-29 18:19:05 I do need to get an oil change and a wash for my car. Where do I find this service shop?
2702 2018-03-29 18:18:54 Third Circuit handed down a precedential opinion Thursday that saddled 3 Citgo units with the lion's share of liability for a $100 million-plus oil spill judgment and said the refiner must fully repay the fed gov for its role in the cleanup, reversing a lower court's decision.
2703 2018-03-29 18:18:29 So Canada's current pipelines aren't running at capacity, the price of oil is low, and the world market is flooded with oil right now, plus China is a global leader in renewable energy with other Asian countries following close behind. Why exactly would we build another pipeline?

2705 2018-03-29 18:18:06 Trump - proving again today, he wants to be a dictator of a banana republic.  He lied about Amazon, he lies about everything.  He's a jealous little sorry excuse of a man.  His fans are like cult members, brainwashed and drinking snake oil.  Presidents should be better than him!
2706 2018-03-29 18:17:55 Well that's the most expensive oil change I've ever gotten and it's only taken about a week and a half and about $400 just to get an oil change done guess who lost my business for life
2707 2018-03-29 18:17:46 Seadrill goes to court April 5 for re-structuring, If SDRL gets busted up, and Gulf of Mexico oil can't get work done during this period. what happens to $/value of reserves in the ground? GULTU +25% might be a signal of what is to come

2709 2018-03-29 18:17:36 @qvcuk Your chosen courier @Hermesparcels thought flinging my order of 2x glass bottles of oil over a fence was considered ‘delivering to a secure location’. Most disappointing service... #CustomerService #hermes
2710 2018-03-29 18:17:29 But is the PDP saying we should just gloss over all their looting spree of the past? If they didn't steal, then where's all the oil revenue?
2711 2018-03-29 18:17:25 Good luck on a signature from the Trump! Said with sarcasm, sorry! Don't think that he cares about anything but oil on Indian reservations!

2714 2018-03-29 18:17:07 10k I need to buy pasta, oil, potatoes and veggies. I'm cooking for my church people to surprise them! Thanks in advance

2721 2018-03-29 18:16:14 @MillerChev to Pick up my 2015 suburban with 28,000 miles on it which cost me $70k And I am@told it needs a throttlebody cleaning at a cost of $200 REALLY @GM This is not covered under warrantee and considered a service item. I guess it has nothing to do with an oil burning issue

2723 2018-03-29 18:16:09 Question.. 
Do I have to use "dried"
#chili flakes to make a

frozen #peppers finely chopped?
2724 2018-03-29 18:16:00 They are already making money, I think it would be much sooner. Again, ahead of legalization when health Canada has to get their ass in gear. I asked IR what they have in oil reserves they said 5,000 bottles a month are being produced since getting that license.
2725 2018-03-29 18:15:56 Biore cleansing oil ke?
2726 2018-03-29 18:15:52 Used @ItsAll_ByDesign beard oil. My gwerries here asking me "what perfume do you use?" 
2727 2018-03-29 18:15:48 Clicks lock up the twisp cigarette refills, local Spar has Bio oil behind the counter. Was told parker pen refills are also big theft.
2728 2018-03-29 18:15:44 maaf aku ga pernah pake. tapi logika aja sih.. kan itu tulisannya udh "oil" pasti bakal licin dan oily kalo dipake ehehehe.

2735 2018-03-29 18:15:24 i’m out of almond milk so I just put like half a jar of coconut oil in my coffee
2736 2018-03-29 18:15:02 Looks like a starch clump. Not pretty, but harmless. They're a result of the sugars in the potatoes that are released during the frying process. These starches over time collect in the oil, stick together & form clumps. We inspect for these but  missed this one! I'm sorry!
2737 2018-03-29 18:15:02 I knew it was only a matter of time until somebody cried about the birds.   Nah we shouldn’t do anything to maintain our civilization, coal, oil & gas will eventually run out.  We haven’t built a nuke plant in decades.  Wind farms and this kill birds.  What’s your proposal?

2741 2018-03-29 18:14:35 Like Standard Oil the largest Internet companies have become too large  and yield far too much control, over both government and the people

Breaking  them down under anti combines directives, would be the best solution allowing competition to drive prices and far more employment

2745 2018-03-29 18:14:20 Forte oil starts selling solar power inverters... Custom makes life difficult for others. Dangote is the richest man in Africa because of his government connect. Forget all those people pushing you to do business, lowkey you don't know who their parents know
2746 2018-03-29 18:14:07 it can be shipped to all 50 states from what I've seen. It's helped clear my head of ruminating thoughts. It's just caused lots of digestive issues because I don't handle MCT well, which is the carrier oil.
2747 2018-03-29 18:14:01 Dude's got an oil diffuser in a study room and all I wanna do is open the door to see which one he's using.
2748 2018-03-29 18:13:59 And when you do, ask him why he reported the BP gulf spill from a natural oil seep in Louisiana.
2749 2018-03-29 18:13:42 Norway has abundant natural resources in addition to oil, & hard working people. The way I see it the only people in this world being paid who don't pull their weight are those with unearned income from their parents or monopolies. Labor is spunged on by people who live on rent
2750 2018-03-29 18:13:30 Yes  you make it with canola oil instead of butter
2751 2018-03-29 18:13:20 Like Standard Oil the largest Internet companies have become too large and yield far too much control, over both government and the people.

2752 2018-03-29 18:13:12 U.S. Rig Count is down 2  rigs from last week to 993, with oil rigs down 7 to 797, gas rigs up 4  to 194 and miscellaneous rigs up 1 to 2
2753 2018-03-29 18:12:52 You could mix chemicals with coconut oil and sell it on twitter your business will be boomin
2754 2018-03-29 18:12:38 the thought of putting coconut oil anywhere near my skin or hair makes me cringe
2755 2018-03-29 18:12:35 Depends on how you define”best” but my statement still stands
2756 2018-03-29 18:12:30 its not being ingested its supposed to only be a drop on your tooth brush and the coconut oil is a solid the you put in your mouth and use it like mouthwash for about 10 minutes
2757 2018-03-29 18:12:28 I remember I went to get a $30 oil change I left with a $500 receipt smh
2758 2018-03-29 18:12:27 Absolutely. And reciprocated. Thanks Oil.
2759 2018-03-29 18:12:19 I grew up on the Whip, but I use mayo now. I like the Hellmann's olive oil one.
2760 2018-03-29 18:12:17 They could stop giving so much money to oil, but no, make the taxpayers carry the burden.
2761 2018-03-29 18:12:16 Lol, you comparing something like that to a pipeline? That was a failure by the manufacturer of the BOPs and guess what, nature took care a lot of that oil, rest was cleaned up. Nobody likes to see it but compare apples to apples...

2768 2018-03-29 18:10:53 @chefsymon saw the show today. For the frying portion you do a great job of showing us how to do the dry, wet and fry. I may try it. However my question is what do you do with the oil afterwards? Not sure how to dispose or keep it, or how long you can keep it? Thanks pal!

2776 2018-03-29 18:09:59 Nej på första, ja på andra. Det är ett av många argument, men jag tycker såväl MSFT/IBM/S.OIL o dess respektive turer inom domstolar avseende antitrust är väldigt goda argument för att låta AMZN flyga.

APC: No, PDP wasn’t better. And this is why: Years of $100-oil, no savings, no investments. Reserves were falling. Grand looting was rule not exception. APC doing @NSIP_NG etc.

SP: Shut up! Why are you comparing yourselves to PDP?

2800 2018-03-29 18:07:12 It's claimed the earth has enough oil left for about 53 more years at current production levels. (a number from 2014) 53 years is just under a persons life span.  That if these number are correct. Meaning it's a short amount of time compared to the grand scheme of things.
2801 2018-03-29 18:07:04 We do and we love it. I think @MrsFitMama turned me on to it. Full disclosure we do also keep oragel on hand for that “extra” relief but I have no complaints on the oil. We still wear the necklace but I’m not really “sold” on that but also not willing to skip it.
2802 2018-03-29 18:06:45 You want further proof that I'm a badass? Later today, I will be changing the headlight bulb on my car myself. I always change my own headlight and taillight bulbs...and fuses. I'd change my oil, but my mom refuses to let me use her driveway 
2803 2018-03-29 18:06:41 Groundhog Day is out dated. We need coconut oil day. Set the ceremonial coconut oil outside and when it melts, only 4 more weeks of winter
2804 2018-03-29 18:06:38 Muscle tissue is sterile. Meat is sterile. The exterior is where the danger is at, and a good searing or blanching handles that. 

Sous-vide to 135 til the heat reaches the center, take it out, dry with paper towels, oil, rub, sear, eat it red.

2808 2018-03-29 18:06:07 Worth noting that in the offshore oil and gas industry we have essentially banned using Chinese made shackles because the steel is unreliable and can fail without warning.
2809 2018-03-29 18:05:53 And what of that of the previous 33 years, they developed and built our economy I suppose. Yet we were not the biggest economy in Africa. But the corruption if the previous 5 years saw grow up to the largest in Africa. What of Abacha loots and IBB gulf oil wind fall?

2817 2018-03-29 18:05:12 @Wayfair and @TripAdvisor have both lost my business. Hopefully others will stop using them
2818 2018-03-29 18:05:07 they also had to have their wings wiped regularly with a particular oil to stop the skin cracking or drying out, because their mother's saliva (and urine/feces) would keep those moistened naturally. there should be more detailed info for babies of that species online somewhere
2819 2018-03-29 18:05:06 Oh Yeah, I forgot it was against the Oil. 

It's like when Groesnick had a 45 save shutout debut for the Sharks and they show his dad who on short notice got there, in the crowd just weeping uncontrollably with pride. It hits you in the feels.

Those are what make sports amazing.

2823 2018-03-29 18:04:33 Just a deflection from the real clean fuel: electricity. EVs are taking off and will kill oil company profits. Hydrogen is tricky to handle and is not a clean fuel being made using fossil fuels to electrolyse water to get hydrogen. A deflection, a shiny thing but totally useless!

2825 2018-03-29 18:03:52 Oh! Him being tuff. We have a suggestion if mommy wants to try. A few drops of neem oil mixed in 1 teaspoonful of coconut oil. Massage it gently on the wound. It'll taste bitter so him wont lick it. And all natural too! 
2826 2018-03-29 18:03:29 Coconut oil. Tea tree oil & Apple cider vinegar.....my cure for any and everything 
2827 2018-03-29 18:03:29 Why can't mechanics just change my oil without making up 252986225 problems with my car?
2828 2018-03-29 18:03:17 What i find to be shameful was the #FISAabuse from last admin,selling off of 20% of U S. Uranium to Russia, destabilizing middle east & Libya, effectively creating ISIS which ruthlessly murdered women & kids,all for oil and $$  #MAGA #qanon #greatawakening
2829 2018-03-29 18:03:16 If so, they are forgetting that the US is will be, or is, the largest oil producer in the world. Will further accelerate our development.
2830 2018-03-29 18:03:05 So what! Let's get rid of his oil and money!

2832 2018-03-29 18:02:27 Already got the car back; she looks (and smells) fine. We'll see over the next few weeks how she does. Probably gonna do an oil change just to be safe...

2842 2018-03-29 18:01:40 Again I agree there nearly 100% but there are so many variables. Hypothetically take Saudi oil. If we go to renewable resources and they take huge losses. You couldn't honestly believe WP had any relationship to the "arab oil crisis" the skin doesn't matter.
2843 2018-03-29 18:01:39 The market has been crashing every 8-9 years.1987,1999,2006-7, so it was supposed to crash in 2016.But war in Middle East and low oil prices have kept economy going. Housing market is overvalued. If corporations don't pay taxes,taxpayers more then there's a crash in 2019.
2844 2018-03-29 18:01:24 i need to start a oil company
2845 2018-03-29 18:01:09 This is a game changer for Oil&Gas Tradeshows! Limited booths left! Act quickly!
2846 2018-03-29 18:01:03 What about if I cook em on the stove but gently coat the pan with just enough oil for em to not stick  I’m healing or dying?
2847 2018-03-29 18:00:58 Hmm. Didn't Brazil and Argentina nationalize control of oil and gas? We need to closely examine those Federal takeover provisions in the new Canadian project impact assessment & review process. #canpoli

2851 2018-03-29 18:00:43 I can churn out tweets all day. Thank goodness I have to go and shower. I  use Dr Pierre Ricaud's Huile de Douche (shower oil) which suits my  soft youthful skin. It's soap free and can't be bought in @BootsUK. Pity.
2852 2018-03-29 18:00:41 On a related note, what is the recommended method from printrbot to lube the linear bearing carriages? Some industrial ones have a nipple that you attach to or there is a needle you put through the hole to push the oil/grease into the block. Also, do you just recommend 3-1 oil?
2853 2018-03-29 18:00:40 Dropped my car off for an oil change and got it back vacuumed and with my registration sticker from 8 months ago put on. Oh & he complimented my Jesus station, so I think I just fell in love.

See you soon @Heid_oil

2855 2018-03-29 18:00:35 I'd probably drop it in a vat of oil
2856 2018-03-29 18:00:25 No.  It's the same kind of thinking that led to the breakup of the railroad and oil trusts at the turn of last century.
2857 2018-03-29 18:00:20 Some people on the keto diet drink bulletproof coffee that has coconut or mct oil and butter in it. I can't stand coffee either.

2861 2018-03-29 17:59:59 Do we start seeing extended incinerator permits, gas re-injection and/or storage schemes or the most likely gas to power generation as a way to conserve gas? Economics work for power gen when you factor in lost oil due lack of gas egress

2863 2018-03-29 17:59:51 This is why I avoided theology school and why my children will never go. It's a collection of snake oil salesmen trying to squeeze a new meaning our cure for what ails modern man, out of a scriptures that already lay out the solution to man's affliction of sin.
2864 2018-03-29 17:59:35 Pythagoras would rise, soaked in olive oil, and use his least best slaves to try his latest theorem much like our modern day Phillies skipper @JesusZoidberg
2865 2018-03-29 17:59:31 If you don’t eat tuna, like me, but enjoy chicken salad try making salmon salad. I used lemon, dill, little olive oil, mayonnaise, plain low fat yogurt, little bit of yellow mustard, celery, and onion. Season with black pepper, garlic powder, paprika, and a pinch of salt! So good
2866 2018-03-29 17:59:28 They realize that the oil company doesn’t give a duck and they’ll just increase the price to cover for it. Are you just gonna not use gas ever again?

2868 2018-03-29 17:59:15 I once watched they're documentary they inject their muscles with some oil..lol they don't even go to the gym..
2869 2018-03-29 17:59:11 Exelon submitted dynamic de-list bids in FCA 12 for Units 7, 8 and 9 and ISO retained Unit 7 (575 MW gas or oil steam unit) and Unit 8 (703 MW combined cycle unit) for reliability reasons, but let Unit 9 de-list for just the 2021-22 capacity commitment period. Same cld happen now
2870 2018-03-29 17:59:11 maybe Canada should have import tariffs on foreign oil.  Then quebec would be motivated to buy local

2872 2018-03-29 17:59:08 What they "gave" was a slap in the face! They simply refuse to tax the billionaire oil and gas industry....
2873 2018-03-29 17:59:06 So, I've been taking CBD oil for the last 3-4 weeks and have noticed some improvement in terms that my muscle spasms have stopped. 
Nerve pain and muscle weakness are still kickin' around but it's nice to not feel like my muscles are going to explode anymore.

2875 2018-03-29 17:58:48 Amazon just gave me two of everything that I had ordered. Unfortunately, what I ordered was smoke detector batteries and cutting board oil.
2876 2018-03-29 17:58:45 Of course we know that the oil business is embedded in more sick ooze than its product.  Still, we would be better off if the former Secretary of State could have eased out the current insane POTUS.

2888 2018-03-29 17:57:00 Or a good negotiating tactic/economic shot across the bow warning a new economic paradigm is being introduced and we have the biggest guns. Everybody wants in the US economy. What I think is interesting is the neoliberal petrodollar is dying & US will be biggest producer of oil.
2889 2018-03-29 17:57:00 Canada filth is meant to be crudely refined - and exported - Wars are run on Oil - & War Profiteers are behind all this.

2890 2018-03-29 17:56:48 I'm going to be real with y'all, if I gotta put oil and shit in my beard, it kinda defeats my point of having the beard.

2920 2018-03-29 17:54:05 In the opening of "Dynasty" the heavy focus on fashion in addition to constant landscaping shots draws a connection to these beautiful locales and the lifestyles of the people. I found this particularly interesting when the background was an oil plant. #tvhist18

2931 2018-03-29 17:52:30 Loans backed by UK taxpayers are heavily favouring oil and gas projects over renewables. Call it what you want. Subsidy free solar is real now and windfarms are on the way as their cost continues to drop.

2950 2018-03-29 17:50:57 How about stop ignoring black and brown people who are more likely to be exposed to pollution or live near toxic oil and gas facilities, Immigrants being removed by Ice, Women rights being violated due to insecure white men that hide behind the bible, Children living in poverty.
2951 2018-03-29 17:50:57 Ok I see. Wow so that jar will last several months, seasons even. That’s good to know.
I like the ingredients list, too; that mineral oil is one of the last ingredients. Thanks for this!
2952 2018-03-29 17:50:42 In history we have always broke up big monopolies. Not good for businesses or consumers. This is no different than oil, steel, and car business. Need competition and fair and balanced business needs and costs.
2953 2018-03-29 17:50:42 That would be a great excuse to nationalize energy, eh? Oil causes chaos. Therefore...

2958 2018-03-29 17:50:04 1.) John D had no conscience in business. Let's not even go there. Carnegie was not even involved in the oil industry but in the steel industry & this partnership was an inconvenient alliances because they were stiff competitors in both extraction and refining the steel ore
2959 2018-03-29 17:50:00 OB訪問……？
2960 2018-03-29 17:49:57 คิดถึงเตย

2962 2018-03-29 17:49:47 Yeah your skin is probably adjusting to the different environment. Used to producing oil to compensate for dryness in CO and now it’s not.

2966 2018-03-29 17:49:15 Hi Alex really enjoyed this piece. Question - (I am a big bagel and peanut butter fan) - what brand of wholemeal bagels did you get and what nice peanut butter without palm oil. Is it Meridian peanut butter?
2967 2018-03-29 17:49:06 Should have put some baby oil on the legs too
2968 2018-03-29 17:49:00 This girl I was sitting beside in the waiting room while I was waiting to get my car oil changed had the most prettiest acrylic nails, I asked her where she got them done & she told me at the L’Amour at the mall but that place isn’t even good sis, why you lying 
2969 2018-03-29 17:49:00 Self care is so important. Getcho nails did. Getcho hairs did boo. Take care of yo skin boo. Slather yo body in coconut oil. Take yo butt to the gym. Buy yourself new shoes. Spend that rent money on some jewelry. Go bankrupt stunting on the gram. #TreatYoself
2970 2018-03-29 17:48:54 Saudi Arabia’s stock market will join a major emerging markets index in 2019 for the first time, in a move that is set to channel billions of dollars in investment into the kingdom ahead of a potential local listing of state oil giant Saudi Aramco.

2982 2018-03-29 17:47:36 She refused to open her mouth as the massive tentacle push itself against her lips. But she quickly gave in as the oil was poured onto it, the aphrodisiac instantly going to work on her mouth. She gagged as the huge thing shoved itself all >
2983 2018-03-29 17:47:35 Just never top up oil on a warm engine
2984 2018-03-29 17:47:20 What a world. I buy the oil and vape it like a fuckin nerd because the smoke hurts my throat!

2995 2018-03-29 17:46:08 @TimoneLandrover Hi Timone. Sorry to bother you I've got one question. When you owned Volvo C30 did you have any problem with engine oil level problem? I bought this car recently
2996 2018-03-29 17:46:07 You’re missing the point. Countries in Europe can produce and refine their own natural gas and not be under threat from Putin on oil and gas. 

He literally uses it as a weapon against eastern european countries like Ukraine.
2997 2018-03-29 17:46:03 I haven't watched Lorenzo's Oil in a while! I lub that movie 
2998 2018-03-29 17:45:51 I need like 50 gallons of cooking oil and I'm set for the year 
2999 2018-03-29 17:45:49 Sex happens all the time and it’s not working lmao. I’m gonna have to find some stairs. I’m damn near down to try anything minus the oil shit cause no thank you

Act 3: Some idiot had phyrexian oil on their shoes and suddenly there goes the neighborhood, Emrakul the Compleat triggers his transformed flip side, soulbonds with Nicol Bolas, and annihilinfects the Plane, creating new card frames in the process.
3002 2018-03-29 17:45:32 Agree.  But like you say, the Oil would be hands down last in the league without him.  So far 102 points and he was very ill for 2 months of the season.
3003 2018-03-29 17:45:28 @carlquintanilla @BobPisani Broad Mrkt rally Tech - Banks - Materials - Oil??
3004 2018-03-29 17:45:20 Shame on them, picking on the poor, downtrodden, and poverty-stricken oil industry. 
3005 2018-03-29 17:45:04 As a rural, northern Albertan, I could not think of anything worse for our province than another pack of Calgary-centric, money-tarded conservatives taking the reins of power. Its a damn good thing the majority of us are not “oil and gas executives “.
3006 2018-03-29 17:44:56 I’m paying for brakes, tires and and oil change! I need my pops to come save the day!!! I’m not use to this 
3007 2018-03-29 17:44:53 Like how Yoona said Bogum didn’t need to use the pan to cover the oil splatter since they’ll need to wash it

I wonder if she was thinking Bogum should get off work soon so he can get enough rest & wake up in time to make breakfast the next day XD
3008 2018-03-29 17:44:47 “Statistics Canada cited a 7.1 reduction in oil sands production due to unscheduled maintenance shutdowns.” Let’s makes sure we tell the whole story and not just what #KM and big oil want us to hear! #cdnpoli

Do you know the safety precautions in place, do you know the benefits far outway an imaginary oil spill, do you know there is containment plans in place,do you know there are many oil tankers going between Alaska & Wash every day?

3030 2018-03-29 17:43:04 It’s not funny to me. I grew up in Oklahoma. Men like this own the state. They pretend to be Chreeestian which is somehow defined as not believing in climate change. Science is only useful for drilling for more oil, not for dealing with after effects. Jesus takes care of that.
3031 2018-03-29 17:42:46 Twic card is finally here , it’s time to head into the oil fields 
3032 2018-03-29 17:42:37 Agreed. Toothpaste doesn't tend to go back in the tube. That's why I called Peterson a snake oil salesman. But we do have to look at why traditional intervention strategies are failing men in particular.
3033 2018-03-29 17:42:35 It’s a question of time that Saudi will ship oil in Yuan. Strong economic complementary between the two countries.
China probably will hold significant stakes in Armco and become an important enabler in Saudi’s effort to transform its economy from over reliance on oil.

3037 2018-03-29 17:42:00 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
3038 2018-03-29 17:41:54 Day 9: I bought Aaron Burrd and friends a bird feeder and black oil sunflower seeds. So far Aaron Burrd has ignored my gift and is still trying to break in via the window.
3039 2018-03-29 17:41:31 I wish the NHL would go with a MOP award, like the CFL. Less room for argument. Why not have an award for the best player? McDavid is the best player in the NHL...and it’s not even close. The Oil would be in 33rd without him. Who should win the Hart MVP trophy this year?
3040 2018-03-29 17:41:11 Just saw this one - yes, O know what it CAN do. I also know that oil is absolutely INDISPENSABLE to our society, and demand will grow over next 50 years regardless of what green garbage happens.
Also - do you support Canada above all other countries?
3041 2018-03-29 17:41:08 I’m so bad w/ cars ion think no female should have to get her own gas.. oil changes or put air in her tires etc
3042 2018-03-29 17:41:02 Lavender is one of the best, all-purpose herbs and oils to have around. Use lavender for dream magic, grounding, emotional balance, easing anxiety, rebirth, and much much more.

Bonus: our Lavender essential oil is on sale at the moment!
3043 2018-03-29 17:41:02 Hillary & Obama gave Russia Uranium. POTUS will take away their OIL next.Putin punked by potus Putin & Dems don't even get it. Now Putin will loose millions from tourism.
3044 2018-03-29 17:41:00 If you charging over $100 to see in my hair you better treat my shit PERIOD. A wash, condition, blow out, oil treatment, trim and allat better be included.
3045 2018-03-29 17:40:54 Haven't a clue but looks like it'll piss oil everywhere
3046 2018-03-29 17:40:51 hmm you could maybe try adding a bit of chili powder (or if you want it hotter, cayenne pepper powder) but I feel like you might wreck the flavor a bit
a blend of hot sesame and chili oil might be a bit less aggressive in terms of changing the flavor, something to experiment with
3047 2018-03-29 17:40:30 I think oil is a dry liquid lol
3048 2018-03-29 17:40:24 Do you protest the dumping of waste into our waters also? I haven't seen any big demonstrations like this in BC or Quebec where it is a HUGE issue creating a toxic environmental impact and not just a potential one like the pipeline. Is it just oil you focus on? Why is that?

In retrospect- it was a poor choice to keep the bottle of sesame oil next to the bottle of flavored coffee syrup.

3070 2018-03-29 17:37:35 If you know all these, then you should know why John D. Built his refinery away from the extraction point, giving rise to the transportation of oil via pipelines. Standard Oil had issues storing the bye products, but he was already ahead in the refining game with his kero.

3086 2018-03-29 17:35:07 Cash is the place to be right now. I got messed up this last week. Almost back to normal if today keeps coming through. Oil is going to be a good short soon. I'm waiting for 66 again.
3087 2018-03-29 17:34:58 Those Saudi's are using that oil wealth to become self-sustainable, then they'll cancel trade and hoard oil to be used in their war machine, with which they'll take over the middle east and possibly the rest of the weak oil-dry world. WWIII is gonna be a bitch.
3088 2018-03-29 17:34:58 Great job. You should be Minister of Information, but PMB doesn’t think so. Great job indeed. This admin is working, doing a lot with low oil revenue compared to the past govt, but the info ministry is in coma. @MBuhari @ProfOsinbajo

3102 2018-03-29 17:32:29 The truth is that the emergence of renewables as mainstream, becoming cheaper than all fossil fuels, has been completely predictable for at least the last five years, arguably the last decade. Big Oil has been well aware but has painted it as a remote future, not today's reality.

3106 2018-03-29 17:31:47 The picture gets clearer and clearer. Not to mention oil supplies being cut and world oil prices rising. These thieves Trump, Kushner, Putin, Saudis, UAE, etc. are all committing a heist of the worlds wealth. Stay tuned for arms race and war games!

3224 2018-03-29 17:18:23 cutting back (not completely out) on dairy has helped a lot, plus regular exfoliating & moisturizing. I’ve also been using rosehip oil (has been great for my texture and pores) & a vitamin c serum to keep my skin “plump” I guess you could say & tighter (helps with wrinkles too)
3225 2018-03-29 17:18:18 for the exfoliant I use 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup brown sugar, scrub for a few minutes, wash your hair regularly and then put on a *ton* of conditioner, tie your hair up and leave it in for 30-45 minutes, and then comb your hair while you rinse it out in the shower !!
3226 2018-03-29 17:18:17 I’ve learned that not every YouTube tutorial or hair product they use is going to work for my curls. It takes time, trial & error, and patience to find the right cocktail. I’ve also learned that coconut oil is a great solve for a dry scalp!
3227 2018-03-29 17:18:11 @HalftimeReport Took a position in $RDS-B today. 6% dividend. 11x earnings. 1.35x book. $XLE has hung in the last two weeks but still has not fully reflected crude oil's rise in the past six months. This unloved sector is starting to get attention.
3228 2018-03-29 17:18:08 Can you please provide evidence to back up this claim that historically Scotland has recorded the lowest economic growth in the developing world? 

If that’s the case, It will be shocking to see that a small oil rich country has preformed so poorly over the years

3234 2018-03-29 17:16:51 The desk is an old table that I found in the basement of an old hand press printers in Baltimore. It was completely covered in oil, I nurtured it back to health and brought it back with me when I returned from the US.
3235 2018-03-29 17:16:44 I got carded recently & burst out laughing. Cashier looked at me like I was crazy.  I know state regs require carding anyone who looks 30 or younger, but I’m 57. Gotta be the blue, purple, green, on dk brown “oil slick” hair color? Made my day, lol.
3236 2018-03-29 17:16:37 This is going to sound very "pick me"- ish BUUUUT... When I see a brotha with locs I just want to say, "Let me spray some leave in condish in your hair and oil your scalp with some Mango Jamaican Black Castor Oil".  And then... scalp massage. I'm so damn extra.
3237 2018-03-29 17:16:21 Im Italian, so I’m pretty sure there’s an olive oil content in my blood at all times...I’m definitely going to check out the lard and duck fat, though.
3238 2018-03-29 17:16:02 I’ve literally tried every natural face oil in an attempt to not age. Check back in 10 years so we can see if it worked #AgeAintNothingButANumberANDWRINKLES

3244 2018-03-29 17:14:59 My recipe is 2 tablespoons butter, 2 tablespoons coconut oil, 1 tablespoon heavy cream, dash of cinnamon. It kinda looks tastes like liquid toast.
3245 2018-03-29 17:14:58 I’ma just throw a lil coconut oil into the routine.

3255 2018-03-29 17:13:45 @realDonaldTrump contd: you are now hurting the lower class people with much higher gas prices and no reason for this except for you making shady deals behind the scenes, then asking us to get the oil price up and they give you what you want but you're hurting the American people
3256 2018-03-29 17:13:35 interesting..they couldn't differntiate between heating oil and diesel. oil is oiil at the end of te day, so petrol vat would have to go too. lucky vat is 5%, otherwise all the they had left is the standing charge which exeeds the vat most times
3257 2018-03-29 17:13:33 Repealing funding for this after you agreed, can't upset your masters at big oil can you @GOPHouseOK
3258 2018-03-29 17:13:25 Haven’t heard of that one before, I’ll have to let @MrsLightMatters know, she’s rather partial to coconut oil
3259 2018-03-29 17:13:12 The oil can? Do you mean the class 1 inter-city express to Uckfield?

3271 2018-03-29 17:11:42 So non of y’all couldn’t tell me Jamaican Black Castor Oil is not to be applied directly to hair and not to be used daily?
3272 2018-03-29 17:11:42 I read that Rih's is gel-based. Not saying that justifies the price, but it seems that most shimmers are oil-based. Do you know if gel vs. oil makes a difference?
3273 2018-03-29 17:11:24 BC is building SiteC. You’re confusing that with kinder Morgan pipeline which we will continue to block since shipping the oil puts BCs coast at too great a risk
3274 2018-03-29 17:11:23 Bernie Sanders and his candidates have been LOSING. That is the actual fact. The only ones still pushing Sanders and ignoring all the evidence against him and his snake oil are GOP'ers, Russian bots and Leftwing ideologues who have bought into the Sanders cult.
3275 2018-03-29 17:11:21 If your car is completely out of oil and you refill it, does that count as an oil change? Asking for a friend
3276 2018-03-29 17:11:10 Of cooking oil.
3277 2018-03-29 17:11:07 That's thanks to the Obama recovery. What is your donor Russell Gordy doing with his tax windfall? Is he raising wages or hiring at Gordy Oil, Gordy Gas, SG Methane or Lone Star Land & Cattle? Please ask and get back to us on that.  And the Koch brothers?

3285 2018-03-29 17:10:10 It’s 2018, aren’t we trying to move away from oil? If eth is oil than it’s on borrowed time.

3290 2018-03-29 17:09:42 you... me... and a bottle of oil
3291 2018-03-29 17:09:34 So, sooner or later that oil and gas will be profitable to drill nevermind industry scare tactics. 2/
3292 2018-03-29 17:09:29 This eucalyptus oil cleared up my sinus congestion so quick
3293 2018-03-29 17:09:04 It's not just wild horses either, wolves, coyotes, grizzlies, bighorn sheep. All being pushed out for domestic livestock. And you're right, public lands being sold or leased for oil, gas, and grazing. National parks, monuments affected too.
3294 2018-03-29 17:09:01 I like to cook with lard, butter, duck fat and the occasional coconut oil. I like using seed and nut oils, like olive oil or grapes seed oil, for cold applications like salad and finishing garnish.
3295 2018-03-29 17:08:56 @mayaghuggins You're welcome! Oh, by the way, if you know of anyone looking for an oil change, let us know! Support local! :)
3296 2018-03-29 17:08:49 @realDonaldTrump you are making deals with these countries behind Americas back and I believe you are making deals making our oil price go up to help these countries so they give you what you want. Now taking the money you had given in tax relief with higher gas prices.
3297 2018-03-29 17:08:47 Alignment and oil change for my baby
3298 2018-03-29 17:08:45 Fact is, Paul and Arnella are right about one thing. There is only so much oil and gas in the ground, and the price on the global market determine whether it's economical to harvest it. The future promises major price fluctuations, although with a general upward trend. 1/
3299 2018-03-29 17:08:44 I’ll wait for @Jackieaina to review the Fenty oils but I already know it can’t be more lit than the Too faced Royal Oil so 
3300 2018-03-29 17:08:38 Despite 3 pipelines having some form of government approval (Transmountain, Keystone XL and Line 3 to Duluth) nothing happening yet.  Problem is the price discount for western Canadian Select.  Trains may help - just read of a tanker of Alta oil leaving Portland for China...
3301 2018-03-29 17:08:38 Actually no. Rockefeller and his cohorts, sought funding to develop refineries that scaled government environmental laws. Their governments almost did them in, with stringent laws. Check the anti-trust hearings that broke up Standard Oil.
3302 2018-03-29 17:08:29 I'll always ship them, but damn...that end was blacker than the oil itself

3306 2018-03-29 17:07:58 I hate coming to get my oil changed for my car i feel so weird LOL
3307 2018-03-29 17:07:57 For YEARS the same was true for me (I'm not even that much of a soda person) but then rewards programs that used to give me free sodas kind of acclimated me to the idea. That's fine, you can stick with fish oil.
3308 2018-03-29 17:07:33 Where can I get some weeds or THC oil in Mass without a medical card?  Just for my personal use.  Thanks
3309 2018-03-29 17:07:32 So right! We libs should be like conservatives! They study every nuance of the huge field of climatology before declaring global warming is a hoax. Their opinions line up with big oil propaganda by sheer coincidence.
3310 2018-03-29 17:07:31 Somebody pick me up from my oil change or ima be bored for an hour lol
3311 2018-03-29 17:07:23 People who are unstable should be reported. Being reported is not a determination of instability. But someone should fucking look.
3312 2018-03-29 17:07:14 Yeah of course! I use it on cotton pads and just wipe it off. I like it better than makeup wipes bc it’s more natural. After the coconut oil I just take a wet cotton pad and wipe my face bc it leaves it oily, then after that I wash my face with face wash.
3313 2018-03-29 17:07:09 And by gone I mean the shop boys took it to change the oil.... but that basically means it’s gone
3314 2018-03-29 17:07:09 Million $ a week is a little nuts and now the cleanup looks like the oil sands where is McKenna look at the sink holes there omg global warming or what? Lol

3319 2018-03-29 17:06:15 Rubbing my eyes too much and my undying love of oil cleansing are the two things that have kept me from getting extensions yet 
3320 2018-03-29 17:06:03 yeah I really thought it was common sense to use oil free facial moisturizers maybe when you’re young you’re naive enough to use body lotion but idk common sense isn’t that common
3321 2018-03-29 17:05:53 My sister is a practicing herbalist. She hates the essential oil thing. It’s crap.
3322 2018-03-29 17:05:53 Sesame and olive oil are the only oils that can be processed naturally (pressed at low-pressure and low temperature).

3324 2018-03-29 17:05:41 97 does help the powerplay....it would be 10% without him. Just like the oil would be 20 points worse without him. Says more about the team around him i think.
3325 2018-03-29 17:05:29 I love rih and fenty beauty but ya girl is broke so I'll continue just putting my loose shimmer highlighters in my body oil and keep it pushing 
3326 2018-03-29 17:05:19 So if I see you with a soda at the movie tonight, there's like a decent chance it's just fish oil on ice?

Like how in the US midwest, gas prices were cheap for awhile because pipeline problems meant canadian exporters couldn't get oil to internaional market

3361 2018-03-29 17:01:35 Ofcourse not cause oil is less dense than water
3362 2018-03-29 17:01:26 Grab a few toilet seat covers to cut up into 2-inch squares. These are great for soaking up excess oil on your face.

3365 2018-03-29 17:01:10 I can’t say I would bet against that. I would, however, bet on any increase to oil and gas taxes via SQ. And I’d vote for it.
3366 2018-03-29 17:01:09 But to be fair to them (and I hate doing that) they did it without a entire nations oil money!
3367 2018-03-29 17:01:02 Baker Hughes oil rigs 798, -2 for the week
3368 2018-03-29 17:00:56 I’m just sitting back waiting getting my oil change and when he said that lawd I had a heart attack on the inside lol
3369 2018-03-29 17:00:55 Left 3 years ago for a career change. Very few good paying jobs in tech outside of oil and gas. Wife needed more options for career as well. Takes two incomes these days. We will likely never return to live in OK with how regressive the culture is. Could care less about taxes.
3370 2018-03-29 17:00:41 We are sad to announce that unfortunately Oil & Water is unable to go ahead tomorrow as part of #AFestivalHuddersfield but we are delighted to announce that ALASKA by Cheryl Martin will be performing at 7pm instead. All original tickets remain valid.

3380 2018-03-29 17:00:18 Originally left 20 years ago when I joined the AF. Returned with my family in 2014. Will be leaving again soon because my state is run by oil companies and out of state investors. Oklahoma standard has gone way down since 98. My Okla pride has turned to shame.
3381 2018-03-29 17:00:16 The Nigerian Navy today destroyed six new illegal refineries with combined capacity to refine four million litres of crude oil daily in Alakiri, Asari Toru Local Government Area of Rivers State. Why destroy them? Can't we make them useful? No other options?
3382 2018-03-29 17:00:15 Let's see? big oil in politics, SOS Tillerson makes a beeline for Ukraine, he must have finished his agenda, "he's going to be happier now" each day I'm awakened to deeper corruption

Ahora que tal si sumamos en el año 10 todos los productos agrícolas con potencial, fecha en que (sin fracking) ya no hay Reservas de Oil.

3390 2018-03-29 16:59:05 I use a makeup wipe or coconut oil to take off my makeup and then wash my face. Find a face wash that specifically says it removes makeup 
3391 2018-03-29 16:59:02 Bout to make a car that runs off peanut oil! Shits getting out of hand!

3395 2018-03-29 16:58:29 Saved me the post. Did you also know the Mexican Government makes more money off of money being sent back to their country than they do off their oil industry. Why would they want a wall? Over 20 million dollars was sent from the US alone last year to Mexico. SMH. #ridiculous
3396 2018-03-29 16:58:26 Is this guy for real? He’s living off the taxpayers while the taxpayers pay his rent & pay his salary! Plus his wife is a TOP energy lobbyists[putin oil co.?]?
3397 2018-03-29 16:58:20 Who is feeding us? Its the soil we live on. It’s our place and our oil. God gave us that right. Besides, Baghdad gave no money since 2014. Yet we Kurds managed to become the most secure and developed part of Middle East. Go cry for your failed country, Iraq won’t last long.
3398 2018-03-29 16:58:09 You do know that the law in Greece was that you were not allowed to teach children about any of that, and that you had to have a wife (you know like Socrates’ wife?) try reading Plato’s take on that... and olive oil had been traded in the Mediterranean for 1000years previous
3399 2018-03-29 16:58:07 Airlines should not allow passengers on board if they’re wearing patchouli oil. It is so offensive. It’s like smoking a pipe or cigar. Most people don’t want to be around it. #airtravel #etiquette
3400 2018-03-29 16:57:48 Dr Kelly was at the point of declaring there were NO WMDs in Iraq. NONE. Blair wanted to go to war badly. His need to please Bush Junior was huge as was Bush Juniors need to please Bush Snr. And Bush Snr wanted payback on Saddam for daring to invade Kuwait. His oil reserve.

3409 2018-03-29 16:56:31 Dude if your getting wet and soggy fries from McDonald's then someone is pulling them out of the oil too early
3410 2018-03-29 16:56:26 Prosperity for who? The 150 jobs you estimate this to create or the 10’s of thousands of jobs lost, if we have an accident here? This about foreign oil companies shipping oil to foreign shores through our coast and at our risk for Alberta Oil Tax revenue. #bcpoli #cdnpoli
3411 2018-03-29 16:56:23 @JebBush After having voted for #1 and #2, observing the results, I would never vote for another Bush again. The family spent all of it's time protecting it's oil interests at our nations expense.
3412 2018-03-29 16:56:10 . Ask your mate @EasyBrent, apparently cash burn comes in around 1.5M per month even with no rig, no drilling and no sidetrack . If he starts his own oil company, I’ll be the first in the queue for a job! Tea boy must be on 200k

3424 2018-03-29 16:54:42 Why do insist on wearing old ass clothes that are stained with oil and varnish when I can easily buy all new clothes. I have like a emotional attachment to my work clothes.. we’ve been through to much.
3425 2018-03-29 16:54:42 Lent my partner my Kate Brown’s #Plutopia (he’s into the Space Race and energy). Then I tried to lend him a different book about oil & he said, “I can’t read multiple books at once, I’m not like you.” I started counting how many books I’m reading RN:maybe 4, seems low #amreading

3428 2018-03-29 16:54:04 So the whities are preaching 'white privilege', and the blacks are now preaching 'injustice bc of racism'.  What the hell are kids learning in school about actual real life?

3432 2018-03-29 16:53:30 Finally took my car to the shop and did those repairs they’re always telling you to do when all you want is an oil change. Most importantly, I have cool air again #praise
3433 2018-03-29 16:53:20 I’ve heard that coconut oil instead of butter makes it taste more like creamer.
3434 2018-03-29 16:53:07 Good! If they want oil paintings let art students do it. Give them volunteer hours for it. Now they can put the money to something more useful like fixing up schools.

3437 2018-03-29 16:52:57 Should split up Amazon.  Like we did Standard Oil.  And AT&T.

3439 2018-03-29 16:52:54 Garlic and olive oil or tomato with salt and oil(pà amb tomàquet).

The only paint I work reasonably well with is acrylic/gauche because it’s not loose like WC and also dries quickly unlike oil which is the devil

3447 2018-03-29 16:52:10 That’s what I’m wondering as well. What’s it smell like. Unless it smells scrumptious and unlike any other body oil I’ve ever smelled then it’s a pass for me. 

The price point is off-putting for me and I don’t feel like it fits into her over all price point range.
3448 2018-03-29 16:52:10 Rats I swear peppermint essential oil helped my aching back muscles 
3449 2018-03-29 16:52:03 I was anxious to go do an LLM right after law school. Everybody I graduated with was doing it (it seemed like the natural trajectory + we thought it was a pathway to 'great jobs' especially Oil & Gas in Aberdeen. It was reigning)  Was then advised by a senior at my work to chill
3450 2018-03-29 16:51:49 Does it come with a free can of snake oil?

3453 2018-03-29 16:50:51 I think if one of those engines is still running about in 2018, 20 years after they were built and there is still oil in it I'm pretty sure it's a safe bet that it won't have the Nikasil failure
3454 2018-03-29 16:50:49 We have an olive oil bottle that looks exactly like a Jack Daniels bottle, not only that, but it literally has "Jack Daniels" engraved on it and it's just... olive oil...

3461 2018-03-29 16:49:42 Not to mention Quebec is blocking our dear pipeline, crippling the entire country and forcing the east to buy Saudi oil..
3462 2018-03-29 16:49:39 It’s a plot to frame Putin, so warmongers can justify invasion. They want to convert our socialist Russian brothers to Neo-Liberalism & get their hands on the oil. My guess is this is Tony Blair undermining Corbyn before the election to help his beloved Tory Party!
3463 2018-03-29 16:49:34 Better get used to "Breeding" Oil for fuels..
Getting it out of the earth is getting too tough...
3464 2018-03-29 16:49:33 And I didn’t drop the oil
3465 2018-03-29 16:49:22 And nausea! Combine ginger, honey, and lemon in warm water or tea and it will clear your sinuses and kill the bacteria in your throat while soothing it. Peppermint oil and eucalyptus can help open the sinuses as well

3473 2018-03-29 16:48:10 One important peace factor would have been from beginning that the EU declares that it will take 50% oil/gas from Russia/Iran and 50% from Saudi/USA. But since EU people cannot think the slightest intelligent thought it's always a problem.

Germany 30 FDAX, Ripple XRPUSD, Oil CL, GBP/USD GBPUSD, Gold XAU, US-TECH 100 NQ, EUR/USD EURUSD, Bitcoin BTCUSD.  These stocks are performing very well and they are very popular at the moment.
3477 2018-03-29 16:47:33 Because it doesn't affect production or lifting of crude oil. Simple.

3496 2018-03-29 16:45:26 In the past 6 months; a family member's cancer been reversed 50% in size by taking hemp oil. Oil that would carry a severe fine/jail term if caught purchasing it. Before, I'd have thought 'worth a try in last case desperation', now I'm thinking people are dying for Pharma's lies!
3497 2018-03-29 16:45:26 So many reasons patients dont want to use the "legal source" you represent.  Its too expensive, its mail order only, only buy buds and junk oil, plus the quality of all LP product is trash compared to what is offered at any dispensary across Canada.

3498 2018-03-29 16:45:18 THIS CAR STINKS LIKE OIL. BETTER TRY TO FIX IT WITH MY FARTS AND ASS STANK. *moans involentarily*
3499 2018-03-29 16:45:10 Well, I put oil in my hair all the time and yet it stays dry
3500 2018-03-29 16:44:43 As a Coconut oil devotee. HAHAHA
3501 2018-03-29 16:44:18 Sorry love lol. Oil and spank are a fiver each love.
3502 2018-03-29 16:44:13 and Happ goes deep on 1st pitch
3503 2018-03-29 16:44:13 My story with the lack of opportunities in Oklahoma, @theMarisaMohi, is rife with a sense of general hopelessness because everyone seems perfectly fine with being beholden to oil & gas for forever no matter what and the the deafening theocracies that drown out rational thinking.
3504 2018-03-29 16:44:10 It’s discredited and unethical. Anyone who practices it should be considered no better than a snake oil salesman in a traveling carnival.
3505 2018-03-29 16:44:08 I agree man don't get me wrong the oil was always my second team when cujo was there pronger etc It's sad to see once such a great franchise go through this but they and the Habs are where the leafs were 8yr ago.P.s Mitch is on a 100pts pace I believe he can be that in the future
3506 2018-03-29 16:44:04 Still kind of gross when you look at the snake oil that goop peddles
3507 2018-03-29 16:43:59 So you mean it's dry like if you soaked something into oil it would stay dry ?

3509 2018-03-29 16:43:24 When oil prices in international market surge up.. you take that opportunity and increase electricity tarriff ... Now you tell us s the gas pressure is low... Which one is true ???? If you are using gas , then why do you charge us heavily in name of oil prices ?
3510 2018-03-29 16:43:21 Y’all better get on that too faced wave. They body oil is bomb.

3516 2018-03-29 16:42:49 The KBB value on my car is 4 grand. I wonder what the trade in value is.... NOT.  Just because I come into the dealership for an oil change does not mean I’m looking for a car payment right now. K thanks
3517 2018-03-29 16:42:48 Why is oil and vinegar the best dressing ever?
3518 2018-03-29 16:42:48 how do i acquire a big ol' hunk of bread and a vat of olive oil for it to bathe in from a midtown office building at lunchtime?
3519 2018-03-29 16:42:40 Right. Unfortunately, with negative sentiment any dilution or debt is like oil on a fire. Once people see the money is not going down the drain, the fire will be put out.
3520 2018-03-29 16:42:26 Doesn’t even make sense, if they do this, people who are low on gas will either buy it the day before or the day after, so the oil industry still make money....

3525 2018-03-29 16:41:51 The last time the project was stopped in October. The oil pipeline from Kirkuk will operate in two directions: Iran and Turkey
3526 2018-03-29 16:41:47 I have never heard that point of view, but I have frequently heard that we should find new customers for our oil, preferably in Asia.

3530 2018-03-29 16:41:23 No it does not contain talc powder. This is baby OIL in gel form. The label clearly reads mineral oil, she’s butter and cocoa seed oil. There is no talc in baby oil. End of discussion.
3531 2018-03-29 16:41:19 Any alternative figures or evidence of Rebaz profiting from KRG oil sales to go along with that accusation?

3547 2018-03-29 16:39:26 2. Moisturize your feet skin and use coconut oil to keep flakey skin type away. Flakey skin helps grow cracks on the heels. People who already have cracks vaseline works line magic on the cracks and shows results within weeks.

3554 2018-03-29 16:38:42 It's very easy to criticise without offering plausible solutions. For many, changing elected leaders is the solution to perceived economic deterioration. Obj-Gej-Buhari ... No sound development 'except to share oil money.' My take: we need an holistic legislative intervention.
3555 2018-03-29 16:38:32 Not supporting large corporations and factories can help but vegan products are by no mean exempt from this just by being vegan. Palm oil is a plant used in nearly everything. It’s vegan. It’s cultivation also the reason rainforests are being destroyed and wild species are dying.

3578 2018-03-29 16:34:58 Hi Brian! Overly mushy texture can either be a result of over-blending or too much liquid added. The batter should be thick and not runny. To avoid burning, you may need to turn the heat down to medium-low and add more oil if necessary!

3585 2018-03-29 16:34:04 They could have & did make straight up electric vehicles 30 yrs ago. There is quite a bit car companies CAN do but are lobbied by oil not to.

3590 2018-03-29 16:33:36 @realDonaldTrump If we're doing so well financially, and are no longer dependent on outside oil, etc., why are our gas prices so high?  Or is it just that we are doing so well theoretically, in the stock market?  The reality, our gas prices only go down during an election period.
3591 2018-03-29 16:33:33 Factoring in oil for govt and reinvested revenues, exponential payback looks sweet, but no details on how procurement mechanism / project-level bankability will look under the project so hard to say w/o more details
3592 2018-03-29 16:33:28 Yes we have money, oil and royal power. What do you have in your country? Democratic? Let it benefit you
3593 2018-03-29 16:33:24 Is loadshedding in progress used as tool to Blackmail and arm twisting to increase gas quota!!
You have tariff with consumers who pay you huge money and you must use fuel oil to continiue uninterrupted supply.

3635 2018-03-29 16:28:27 i tried two different ones, but  I tried a coconut oil AND butter AND maple syrup and it was better but not for me.

3637 2018-03-29 16:28:23 Chinese "Petro-Yuan" launches for oil trade in Yuan -- it's backed/exchangeable for GOLD.  Is this the deathknell for the US $ ?
3638 2018-03-29 16:28:18 *Mom and I eating the bread and oil at Bonefish Grill*

Waiter- Would you ladies like another plate of bread?
Us- Ohh it’s okay we really don’t need it
Waiter- Well I saw you two eat it in 10 seconds flat so I didn’t know...
Us- yeah you’re right, bring us another one!


3639 2018-03-29 16:28:14 Why are we playing with Barbies and she’s doing one of their hair talking about do we have any coconut oil left? Lmao idk sis
3640 2018-03-29 16:28:10 I hope this helped you guys
I have been using it for a few months and it has made my skin clearer and reduced my anxiety.
If you have any questions about CBD oil just message me and I'll be happy to answer all your questions.
3641 2018-03-29 16:28:03 It tells us no more than when Dems/Libs/Progs/Leftists collude with anti-science climate alarmists, climate data fraudsters, and EPA administrators that secretly & illegally conspire with climate change snake oil salesmen, to bring the U.S. to ruin @PostOpinions.

3643 2018-03-29 16:27:49 The process of getting Gold, Diamonds, Crude Oil comes with a lot of digging, energy and sweat .. only the strongest and the patient ppl get em
3644 2018-03-29 16:27:48 It didn’t help? Try soaking a cotton ball with baby oil and let it sit on there. I’m pretty sure acetone is the way to go but I think your vision is a priority
3645 2018-03-29 16:27:47 Oil industry is a reserved matter, until it is devolved or we have independence, the UK should be supporting it.
3646 2018-03-29 16:27:47 I go for an oil change and the recommendation list they always give me is always forever long. They always have me feeling like I am driving a shitty car 
3647 2018-03-29 16:27:39 You know who else you should look at are the Koch brothers. Combined they are the wealthiest in the world and their oil empire crushes competition. No?  Coincidentally, they support Trump and Republicans. Hmm
3648 2018-03-29 16:27:27 I don’t know how white girls have a “hair washing day” I didn’t wash my hair for one day and I could heat a house with the amount of oil on my head
3649 2018-03-29 16:27:26 The terrorism in North Africa, West Africa, and West-Central Africa is from Quadaffi's assassination; his work with the African Union threatened the west's usurping of Africa's minerals and oil.

3653 2018-03-29 16:27:00 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.

3655 2018-03-29 16:26:47 Just read that the GOP passed & Trump signed into law a bill barring the government from purchasing oil paintings.

3657 2018-03-29 16:26:18 The lessons of Libya are the same as the lessons in Iraq; taking out a stabilizing leader allowed for militant groups to cause chaos; oil control and no threats to zionism.
3658 2018-03-29 16:26:11 To think tesla is clean energy...wow Yea maybe the final product until the batteries are nfg. Mining for the mineral for the batteries is much worse then oil and gas. Now we need a place to disposes of these useless tesla batteries might as well make a land fill #fuckinliberals
3659 2018-03-29 16:26:08 And without the oil money, you’d be in League 1.
3660 2018-03-29 16:25:59 Omg that last juice I drank had oil of oregano in it  taste won't get out my mouth

3666 2018-03-29 16:25:12 Such as bathing appears to you - oil, sweat, dirt, filthy water, all disgusting - so is every part of life and everything.  Marcus Aurelius
3667 2018-03-29 16:24:56 Until we figure out how to deal with the crisis in men's mental health that has arisen as a result of that shift, snake oil salesmen like Peterson will continue to have a large audience.
3668 2018-03-29 16:24:55 @TheBigMunchkin curious your overall, medium/long term thoughts on SPX, gold and oil? Are you in the similar camp that SPX bottoms around 2450, oil in the mid 50’s and gold will see sub-1280 before significantly higher? Just looking for high level guesstimates. Thanks.
3669 2018-03-29 16:24:52 You voted for sanctions to be imposed back in October - still waiting!  The only way to hold Putin accountable is by imposing economic sanctions on Putin and his oligarch cronies or on Russian oil!  When will Trump do that?
3670 2018-03-29 16:24:49 iya hemp seed oil lagi terkenal di kalangan skincare organik dan natural. Organic Supply Co punya. 
bagus buat kulit kering, lelah dan dehidrasi. buat kuku juga bagus.
3671 2018-03-29 16:24:32 < that oil.

She also felt the dicktacles punching through her cervix and into her womb with ease, each hard thrust causing another moan. She already felt so full, with so many tentacles in her. She'd never felt so full in her life, except for when her mistress had fucked her. >
3672 2018-03-29 16:24:32 I agree. But there are many from Mexico and Puerto Rico and I don't see them getting much love. Venezuela has some of the largest oil reserves on Earth. Just saying
3673 2018-03-29 16:24:31 เป็นคนหนึ่งที่ไม่ชอบการดูถูกอ่ะ ไม่ได้เป็นคนเก่งหรอกนะ แต่ถูกพูดว่าทำอันนั้นไม่ได้ ทำอันนี้ไม่ได้ เคยเห็นเราทำแล้วเหรอ ไม่ใช่ดูจากที่เราเป็นคนแบบนี้ แล้วคิดว่าทำอะไรไม่ค่อยได้หรอก

3675 2018-03-29 16:24:22 It's not an issue of power or oil...its a shift in the West towards isolationism and nationalism, which has impacted decades of interventionism.  Ironically, all the same ppl complaining about the US not doing enough today were the same ones upset they were there to begin with.
3676 2018-03-29 16:24:12 It was through an oil club, so the price is negotiated by them.  She eventually got her oil, but no apology and no compensation offered.

3684 2018-03-29 16:22:58 Her mind was already going blank from being fucked so hard in both her ass and cunt. She screamed in ecstasy as her ass was slapped, the oil making the pleasure shoot through her like a bullet. And her ass was beginning to feel so, so good with the tentacles being covered in >
3685 2018-03-29 16:22:22 im using tea tree oil on my face but the smell really strong omaigad  my mom dont want to sleep with me because im stinks

3689 2018-03-29 16:21:45 my dad thinks me using CBD oil is a problem and that it’s associated with me being “addicted” to marijuana like LOOOOL DRUG TEST ME THEN IT IS LEGAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLL
3690 2018-03-29 16:21:30 In 10 years the world looks different, we may face a oil shortage! 
Therefore it will harm the development anyway, in Ukraine and elsewhere.
3691 2018-03-29 16:21:27 Guna micellar water je pun ok dah. Kalau guna cleansing oil, better cuci balik guna 2nd cleanser sbb takut cleansing oil residue tu akan clog pores.

3693 2018-03-29 16:21:11 Corporations gonna be sick when they cause another oil spill being greedy. And nigga. FRANCE??? That shit is wild smh
3694 2018-03-29 16:20:58 This President & his GOP are destroying our National Lands to make more Money for the Oil Industry & Oligarchs in that Business so we can expect even more slaughtering. Even our National Parks aren’t safe from this regime. It’s pathetic

3697 2018-03-29 16:20:38 Where'd you come from? You look like a nude oil painting.
3698 2018-03-29 16:20:36 The article is about the oil companies. The jobs should be in green energy. Giving money to oil companies is throwing away money on outdated technology. Such a waste. That money is just going to the shareholders when the businesses finally collapse.
3699 2018-03-29 16:20:36 Democrat=Dishonest
3700 2018-03-29 16:20:35 @realDonaldTrump requires NO ONE.  His own mouth and his Twitter wind up boiling him in oil, over and over, like some modern 8th Circle Of Hell.  He would make Dante shudder...
3701 2018-03-29 16:20:35 I really can’t decide if I like @BeavertownBeer ‘s Gamma Ray or Neck Oil more! It’s a quandary! Guess I’ll just have to have both! 
3702 2018-03-29 16:20:34 I used it to clean my face like every two days but for that yeah. It’ll dry it out. Do you have a toner or witch hazel? I usually wipe then spray my face with a mix of tea tree oil and water as a toner if I’m out of witch hazel
3703 2018-03-29 16:20:18 This is my escape.... My rabbit hole...

3705 2018-03-29 16:20:01 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.

3707 2018-03-29 16:19:57 According to the article depictions of men with a white beards counting money are anti-semitic. I'm willing to admit ignorance of the topic but id like to know where else to draw the line. What about a depiction of a saudi Arabian oil baron - would that be anti Islamic?
3708 2018-03-29 16:19:51 So the price of gas jumped 9 cents per litre supposedly because Trump started this new global trade war and China rushed selling oil on the stock market now to retaliate.  

Like I said this will effect every country and not just the US. #TrumpTariffs
3709 2018-03-29 16:19:50 I was this close to doing a shimmer body oil for summer. Rihanna told me to sit down and shut my ass up.
3710 2018-03-29 16:19:44 Man i was so pumped for this pure cbd oil i got and of course i missplace it. now its just this broken nail and some reclaim for a bit. Rest in pepperoni
3711 2018-03-29 16:19:38 The ingredients I love the most in the antioxidant line is the vitamin c, b3(niacinamide) vitamins a,the primrose oil and carrot seed oil.

The @Petrodollar is on it's deathbed as oil is being traded in gold-backed Petroyuan.  Gold-standard is lingering, ready to be implemented and introduced at any given moment. Major stock market correction is expected to occur shortly.
3713 2018-03-29 16:19:33 About like putting another Bush in the Whitehouse. When Bush Grandfather was communist and Bush senior was part of Zapata oil. The only thing keeping Germany tanks running during the war.
3714 2018-03-29 16:19:27 kalo berjerawat lebih baik pake rosehip oil. misalnya The Ordinary Cold-Pressed Rosehip Oil atau Trilogy Rosehip Oil. 
jojoba oil dan marula oil juga bisa. 

grapeseed dan sunflower nya utk masker aja
3715 2018-03-29 16:19:25 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
3716 2018-03-29 16:19:22 That box is huuuuuuuuuuuuge. Like biggly. Gotta love lifetime warranty/no hassle replacement on tools. I use adjustable oil filter wrenches for breaking loose unions in chemical industry. Have been through 3-4 from Craftsman (tension spring rusts out).
3717 2018-03-29 16:19:21 それはそう（戦士は立ち上がる）
3718 2018-03-29 16:19:20 ライカミングだとかのマニュアルを開くと、わざわざoilではなく、fresh oilを入れろという記述が至る所にあります。　オイルの再利用によるトラブルが沢山有ったのでしょうかね？
3719 2018-03-29 16:19:14 idle: reads manuals for new milling machine; "do not use gasoline as cleaning solvent", "ok, makes sense, but who would do this anyways?..."; later, "do not use gasoline as coolant". me: "OK, WTF? why would anyone do this? more so when oil+soap+water is cheaper?..."
3720 2018-03-29 16:19:12 What’s better in you guys opinion, Jamaican or Haitian castor oil?

3724 2018-03-29 16:18:35 But you know today is not a good day to sell red oil
3725 2018-03-29 16:18:17 I use different cleaning products depending on my mood/energy. Today I mopped with peppermint soap because it's the end of the month and I want to welcome April. I love lemon pine sol and oil soap for "deep disinfecting clean". Fabulous when I want fragrance. etc
3726 2018-03-29 16:18:09 เป็นคนนึงที่พอช่วงดึกๆแล้วจะเอาทุกอย่างของวันมาคิด
3727 2018-03-29 16:17:57 it definitely dries out everything for me. I use it for cooking and oil pulling though

3729 2018-03-29 16:17:52 @Thom_Hartmann 12 years of UN inspections found no trace of WMD .  America and Russia had to burn the oil fields in the North of Iraq to regain control of the price of Saudi and Russian  and bankrupt the people of the free world.
3730 2018-03-29 16:17:46 What a load of Crap you are not trying to attack ISIS you are trying to secure oil fields for your control.
3731 2018-03-29 16:17:39 Starting to understand that business and family is like water and oil
3732 2018-03-29 16:17:38 They need the oil to get his fat ass thru the door.... so I’m thinking he said well-oiled... 
3733 2018-03-29 16:17:18 CBD oil relieves nausea, which is great if you suffer with panick attacks as panick attacks have a tendency to make you feel nauseas. CBD oil will make you feel more at ease.
3734 2018-03-29 16:17:14 Lol I’m waiting on an oil change I’ll hit you up when I’m leaving

3736 2018-03-29 16:17:01 Aku pake hemp seed oil. Comedogenic rating 0, means non pore clogging. Kaya akan linoleic acid, molekulnya cukup kecil jadi bisa menyerap ke dalam pori2, baru 2 minggu pake muka udah ga pernah jerawatan lagi krn pori2 jd bersih 
3737 2018-03-29 16:16:53 Well, you know, it’s the Americans. And we in Canada like to swoon over our great “friendship” with them. So, to a lot of Canadians, if we’re getting skinned on oil, well, it doesn’t matter because our great friends are doing the skinning. This is how stupid we are. #cdnpoli
3738 2018-03-29 16:16:38 PXD says 70 years, USGS says 90+++ years....seriously, when xom’s Beaumont expansion full details are out in a few months, we will know how light oil can be tailor-used.

3740 2018-03-29 16:16:21 Ive been using the same stuff for years. Generic acne wash and a clarisonic and simple moisturizer. I wash my face and moisturize after my workout and before bed. The weird thing is I wear oil free makeup and find that the more makeup I wear, the less breakouts I have.

3775 2018-03-29 16:13:51 Saudi Arabia realized they could export more oil by lowering their fossil fuel needs. If only America was smart enough to do the same with natgas. Replace coal w/ solar/wind + storage, so we could export natgas.

3780 2018-03-29 16:13:14 An Agro farming business that initially focuses on casto oil which then later expands to other produce. Then adds a amazon like webstore, which allows direct sales between wholesalers/prpducers and customers, which later empower us to spin up a agro-farming as a service.
3781 2018-03-29 16:13:03 everyone saying he didnt deliver and it was all a fail due to that puts words in his mouth. Changes it around for clicks and drama, for shorts or hating, etc. And the rwst of car/oil is financing that massively (they pay magazines/pages through ads)

3785 2018-03-29 16:12:42 I want to know what 'the country' wants now, not the origin. The fact that England had a colony gives way to think. It is sick that there is war because of oil. I am fascinated by the 'south and north' story, but people have also grown, they are now also entitled to it.
3786 2018-03-29 16:12:31 This Total quartz engine oil ad just put a smile on ma face,Bobooy3le.really.

3807 2018-03-29 16:09:41 I agree we need more regulation but I think you got it backwards when it comes to talking about monopolies. We are trying to get rid of the dangerous monopoly that exists; big oil.

3812 2018-03-29 16:09:23 We will be better off renting our ports to the Chinese and selling our Oil/Gas in the global market. Ambani and Adani get this at throwaway prices and to add insult to injury the Central Govt pockets the Excise tax. Also why should we send 58% of our entire revenue to Delhi?

3815 2018-03-29 16:09:15 4. CBD oil reduces acne. Based on scientific studies CBD oil treats acne due to its anti inflammatory properties and its ability to reduce sebum production. Since using CBD oil, I have seen a massive improvement in my skin!
3816 2018-03-29 16:08:53 Fry Light 1 calorie spray oil, is a cracking idea, until you realise you need about 127 sprays to get the same effect as one tea spoon of actual oil

3823 2018-03-29 16:08:25 I hear you Luke. However, the #PetroGold trade is marked by gold bullion exchange for oil. The Euro is tricked-out fiat currency, not bullion, & Eurozone politics & c.b. monetary policy a nightmare.

3843 2018-03-29 16:06:22 Canada & other oil exporting countries shouldn’t accept payment in Yuan, as the Chinese banking system is rife with problems, not to mention they are not a democracy and overtly aggressive in South China Sea.
3844 2018-03-29 16:06:20 The Navy didn’t pay for it, I’m not a Navy doctor. I went after I was discharge on my own dime. And I’m old enough that I got the old GI bill which was nowhere near enough to cover school. I paid for school by flying helicopters part time on weekends and after classes.
3845 2018-03-29 16:06:12 Yea, it’s going to suck to be the global Standard Oil of the 21st century.

3853 2018-03-29 16:05:11 There is no reason to replenish oil.  use it until it is no longer economic to produce.  Also oil taxes and royalties fund all sorts of virtuous programs.

3860 2018-03-29 16:04:42 all that you have written is correct, jut one thing, in earlier times, food was not that much adulterated.. Now milk, flour, ghee, cooking oil, spices, tea etc, just name anything, everything is adulterated now & chemicals are used to create these

3900 2018-03-29 16:01:03 EU marks their gold reserves to mkt quarterly.  As gold rises, the implied gold backing of the Eurozone's FX reserves will rise with it.  IMO this exact scenario is why EU put 15% of Eurozone reserves into gold in 1999, mkd-to-mkt qtrly - to make EUR attractive to oil exporters.

3908 2018-03-29 16:00:27 Here's a tip: Check your oil level every other time you fill up. The engine will be warm, and you'll remember to give it regular attention!
3909 2018-03-29 16:00:18 To be honest, I’ve still got a lot of time for Ho Sang.  That’s the modern skill set in one player right there... maturing needed, but as an Oil fan watching Hall, maturing is possible for sure.
3910 2018-03-29 16:00:13 You are missing *your patriotism*, Mrs MAGAT. Last I heard I live in a democracy and free speech and dissension are encouraged here.
Since you obviously feel that free speech should be suppressed, perhaps you should should move to Venezuela, or how about Russia?
Good day.
3911 2018-03-29 16:00:13 Oil figures were only one of very many lies they told.
3912 2018-03-29 16:00:06 Without agreeing or disagreeing with you, the answer to your question is that trees are a much more replenishable resource than oil. At least that could be the reason for it being seen as more virtuous.
3913 2018-03-29 16:00:05 I am obsessed w hair fail videos on YouTube,  and I need to know who is telling all these women that coconut oil will magically protect their hair from bleach damage. Spoiler: it never works.

3916 2018-03-29 15:59:51 1. CBD oil reduces anxiety and panick attacks. 

Studies have found that CBD affects certain receptors in the amygdala, which is the part of the brain that engages in the fight or flight response, so taking CBD oil makes you feel calmer by numbing the response.

3936 2018-03-29 15:57:49 3) Since the most sought after commodity in the world--oil--is priced in U.S. dollars, the petrodollar helped elevated the greenback as the world's dominant currency.

3941 2018-03-29 15:57:18 No,I'm saying that oil price is too unpredictable a variable to reliably base your financial future on and I believe that sensible people won't want to bet their future on such a massive gamble.
3942 2018-03-29 15:57:16 Personally, I would recommend using olive oil to sauteé veggies and bake/roast chicken. Butter/vegetable oil to fry

3947 2018-03-29 15:56:41 The core issue is that open sale of oil for gold will result violent price moves if a large supplier rejects fiat. If Europe loses 1M - 2M bbl/day of supply, a v. material price change occurs. Rejection of fiat for oil also impacts bond values (int. rate excursion). #Petrogold

3969 2018-03-29 15:53:41 Not a peep about gov’t complicity in allowing bigger “Al Pacino at end of Scarface” companies to drill horizontally for liquids, finding a lot of gas too and flooding market with that gas to get at liquids.

3977 2018-03-29 15:52:44 The DOE articles says deliveries will take place in April and May. I would assume it will not show-up in inventory until actually delivered. US government could use this as a tool to keep oil prices artificially low and add the economy.

3988 2018-03-29 15:51:03 I completely disagree... Irrational decision you took and inability to manage drop in oil price did. Of course there was corruption in the last 16years but you are only focusing on the person you can confront. Hopefully when an opposition takes over power, we will hear yours

4038 2018-03-29 15:46:56 I hear that pipelines are peeved about being oil companies’ lackies and are on the verge of revolt.
4039 2018-03-29 15:46:49 Disagree. IEA forecasts are for natgas and oil supply to grow rapidly to 2050. Coal will decline only b/c better, cheaper technology for wind/solar + natgas + battery storage will change demand/consumption. Power gen is basic model for other sectors, inc. transportation/oil.
4040 2018-03-29 15:46:49 Want to know something about Lex Luthor? He's bald like Mr.Clean. He uses baby oil to shine his bald head.
4041 2018-03-29 15:46:39 The Third Circuit handed down a precedential opinion that saddled three Citgo units with the lion's share of liability for a $100M-plus oil spill judgment & said refiner must fully repay federal government for its role in the cleanup, reversing a lower court's finding
4042 2018-03-29 15:46:34 Banana republic leaders favor some businesses (such as oil companies---giving them national monuments and our coasts) and screw others like deciding Amazon must go.
4043 2018-03-29 15:46:31 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;

4045 2018-03-29 15:46:23 My guy these are negative externalities that arose from the decline in the price of oil which was and is still our major source of foreign exchange. For the price of oil to decline rapidly, then any economy that is stimulated by oil revenue must suffer
4046 2018-03-29 15:46:10 @hellotaralynn what is that teething oil you mentioned called? I tried to find the video where you showed it but I can’t find it!
4047 2018-03-29 15:46:06 My hair's super dry since it's curly so I find the infusion works better for me with the added oil.
4048 2018-03-29 15:45:58 And oil company executives are conservative. Let's trade!
4049 2018-03-29 15:45:53 My Stihl Chainsaw is almost 40 years old. It's been sitting on the shelf in my garage for the last 2 years. Yesterday I topped off the gas & oil & it started right up & worked like a charm  as always

4057 2018-03-29 15:45:18 Plus most body highlighters are just castor oil or whatever body oil of your choice....some people like fix+ spray...glitter....and some perfume lol you can make it for the LOW LOW
4058 2018-03-29 15:45:17 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
4059 2018-03-29 15:45:12 just make sure your oil is REALLY hot, elkie. or they'll end up soggy.
4060 2018-03-29 15:45:12 Agree, with existing plants. But someone will build a NEW plant to specially handle the light oil if discount is low enough.
4061 2018-03-29 15:45:02 Don’t know if I should buy cleansing oil or not. I really don’t wear make up that much.
4062 2018-03-29 15:44:49 just oil
4063 2018-03-29 15:44:40 idk if there is a right way? I put it on my face after washing and 30 mins before a moisturizer (if I can help it). for body, I mix it with/coconut oil in my hands and slather it on before I dry off. for hair, I usually mix it with condish to detangle
4064 2018-03-29 15:44:38 Thank you sa mga oil ko sa bag. Nawala sakit ng tyan ko. Hahahaha.

4075 2018-03-29 15:43:54 Why wasn't that extra racist turnout seen across the country?  Folks in the MW had 30 years of both parties telling them that free trade is good for everyone as they saw one plant after another shut down.  Along came a snake oil salesman...
4076 2018-03-29 15:43:53 I still think that to colonize Mars, all we need to do is to send Adam, Jamie and rest of the Mythbusters crew along with lets say Colinfurze there with a lathe, steel material and fill the rest of the ship with oil and duct tape.

4080 2018-03-29 15:43:11 Nobody smokes weed if they can avoid it. The medical treatment is with cannabis oil...eaten in various ways. When you're done...you quit taking your meds. Stereotyping is not a healthy approach to problem-solving. Do ya get it?

4083 2018-03-29 15:42:33 Ecuador exports hella cut flowers because they grow better there, and there are massive greenhouses near the airport in Quito, which is a five hour flight from Miami. The "3rd world" is closer than you think. Let them export flowers! It's better than oil.

4088 2018-03-29 15:42:19 I’m pretty sure I just got high off of the valve oil fumes I breathed in from my trumpet

4098 2018-03-29 15:41:41 Girls in cooking oil ads always dump shit ton of oil in pan showcasing it as the most healthy thing ever and then smile at the camera possibly plotting to kill the entire family by giving them a heart attack or cholesterol
4099 2018-03-29 15:41:29 I adore pointing out that lots of us "gun nuts" do, in fact, have a "small dick", although it's not very liberal or open-minded to refer to the clitoris that way. Shame on them! #girlswithguns #2a

4106 2018-03-29 15:40:41 I love checking the oil in my car. It's one of those things that actually makes me feel like an adult for a second.

4108 2018-03-29 15:40:25 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.

4119 2018-03-29 15:39:40 @RBC 1/2: Canadian GDP fell 0.1% in Jan - below market expectat for a 0.1% increase. Weakness was concentrated in a (likely transitory) decline in oil sands output & a pullback in home resale. Outside of oil & real-estate components, output increased about 0.2% by our calculation
4120 2018-03-29 15:39:26 So was Standard Oil and US steel. Hmmmm.

4125 2018-03-29 15:38:57 I’m still skeptical of Gulati. A pre Garber mls employee shouldn’t have been in charge of USSF for so long. 

I’ll believe Garber loves Soccer when I see him juggle a soccer ball 5 times - and that’s 5 less than I’m waiting to see Loney complete.

Oil paint experts can’t be blind
4126 2018-03-29 15:38:53 I'm fairly sure I could find better uses for snake oil. It's a shame, his performance has put a bit of a downer on an otherwise fantastic event.
4127 2018-03-29 15:38:49 You make the error that price is the only factor in how a refinery buys crude oil. They buy on maximising throughput and maintaining stability (no upsets) a refiner does not always buy the cheapest crude
4128 2018-03-29 15:38:45 Bout to get some food, and oil change and a car wash
4129 2018-03-29 15:38:37 Needless to say, I gotta reduce the amount of keef and weed I use to make my oil

4135 2018-03-29 15:38:06 The statement “rich people don’t use public transit” might be statistically true but that’s because we let our grandparents and parents subsidize the oil industry instead of subsidizing our futures
4136 2018-03-29 15:38:05 Yes because all those schools no one has heard of (except UNC) compare to Harvard.

4156 2018-03-29 15:35:52 Unfortunately the hazard of being an oil exploration organisation. Drilling doesn't always mean recoverable oil/gas.
Without seeing the legal documentation regarding access rights I cannot comment on what the outcome will be for the involved parties.
4157 2018-03-29 15:35:50 sadly, we would have to go right back to gasoline, so consumers would become the losers again

the oil industry will not die until america’s energy consumption and transportation infrastructure changes 100%, and we’ll be dead before that happens

4168 2018-03-29 15:34:56 You call it a "slowdown in oil'.  Canadian's call it "shutdown the oil".
You certainly have a way of twisting the truth CBC.

4240 2018-03-29 15:27:38 I never stated you said such. I stated such. The point being - what qualifies exactly as a 'catastrophic spill' when any oil spillage is catastrophic to both soil biology and water cleanliness? Has it ever been okay to pee in the community well, regardless of the amount leaked?
4241 2018-03-29 15:27:29 They certainly supply a lot of job's in Several States. People pay for shipping  unless they are  Prime  Members or order over $49.00.

4242 2018-03-29 15:27:11 That’s dope! Where can you find it and Is it expensive? Also lavender oil helps, like if you rub it on your wrist / smell it calms you. Tried it during a test

He’s killed so many black people over seas for oil, killed a African king because he was working to get a one currency for all Africa which would be gold which would make Africa the most powerful country in
4314 2018-03-29 15:20:46 Dropped my phone in a bildge full of oil and water and it's still going strong!! Galaxy > iPhones
4315 2018-03-29 15:20:39 I got followed by Parnon Olive Oil which makes sense because my first love affair is food.  Some people get followed by @BenAffleck I get followed by food.
4316 2018-03-29 15:20:38 Workplace discussion: who is worse? Guy who dumps oil / antifreeze down the drain/ storm drain --- or --- guy who knows his car has a leak, but never fixes it and just keeps refilling the missing fluid?
4317 2018-03-29 15:20:38 Grill some marinated chicken. Roast vegetables at 425 for 20-25 minutes. Cutting them up is the hardest part. Just spritz with a little olive oil, maybe some garlic or other seasoning. Easy PZ

4321 2018-03-29 15:20:21 BC's actions are no different than if we tried to stop BC lumber from travelling over our roads and rails.  How is cutting down trees more virtuous than producing oil?
4322 2018-03-29 15:20:17 "aviation is essentially a fossil fuel industry, one which guzzles an eye-watering 5m barrels of oil every day."

4325 2018-03-29 15:20:00 #Data is the new everything.

It is the new oil, it is the new water.

It is the system, the service, the app, and the code. 

It is the technology, the business, the customer.

It is the supply chain, and the value stream.

It is profit, and loss.

Data is the new everything.

4330 2018-03-29 15:19:14 Most US onshore producers don’t sell to endusers. Pipe cos do. Agree with you that light oil has a mid distil issue. But i take a leaf from how high mercury and high TAN crudes were eventally absorbedDeep a discount will attract investment sooner than later.
4331 2018-03-29 15:19:14 I paid $52 for my oil and filter for an oil change yesterday WITH my employee discount
4332 2018-03-29 15:18:56 I don’t know if they’re in store tho because people don’t often buy oil lamps even when they shop at Orvis but Orvis still sells them discounted
4333 2018-03-29 15:18:56 I know the Forester burning because of global warming but we have all this oil let's make them out of the byproduct known as plastic boom problem solved
4334 2018-03-29 15:18:56 ...no one is saying get rid of the military. Or police. It's wanting less people in a war we don't need to be in. Wanting the military to be more that something that protects oil interests. You can support the military and not want another war.

4346 2018-03-29 15:17:33 Please remind me again which states have cheaper taxes on oil and natural gas than Oklahoma?
4347 2018-03-29 15:17:31 Why? Why richer? Tiny populations - one enriched by oil - the other by banking... ie. not industrial nations with huge populations like France, germany and UK. If you want comparisons use the right countries to compare us to.

4354 2018-03-29 15:16:40 Too late. Oil tax up to five percent, as it should be.
4355 2018-03-29 15:16:40 I agree with you a 100%, I took quite a lot of pure cannibis oil last year thinking it would only give me a lil high and I was out of it for 2 days and ever since then I've been absolutely terrified of taking anything else, we defo all react to things differently!

4399 2018-03-29 15:11:33 The oil companies just told a court in California that they basically endorse all the IPCC conclusions about human activity driving climate change.

4405 2018-03-29 15:11:16 You really are dumb as fu€k, aren’t you? You want to curb innovation by entrepreneurs. You can’t stop progress. How about we make oil behemoths pay their taxes and fine them when they destroy the environment? How about close loopholes for hedge fund managers?
4406 2018-03-29 15:11:08 technically, the only thing $TSLA burns is cash, rather than oil

4498 2018-03-29 15:02:42 You're right about the unions - we're still paying the price. But UK oil is in long-term decline. Fracking is nowhere.  And a big chunk of the reduction was renewables substituting for coal not nuclear.

4760 2018-03-29 14:34:23 At least they didn't change water into Oil! That would be another kind of miracle!
4761 2018-03-29 14:34:23 Ah, that sounds similar ish? We don't add oil and the water to rice ratio is more 1.25 because it doesn't absorb quite as much (if I added 2 cups it'd be SO mushy)

4783 2018-03-29 14:32:33 I have a love hate relationship with AMZN(Standard oil.of our era).Great innovative co with huge power to disrupt. No laws broken. But anti trust law has been outgrown by AWS and the power it provides. If Trump actually cared, DOJ would review AT law and congress would change

4787 2018-03-29 14:32:11 Anything with spice. Garlic olive oil and sriracha olive oil are my faves. Love some heat and garlic. Of course some bone broth. Coconut aminos is a new favorite. Curry powder or Carribean Jerk. Always fun to play and add to #TheStashPlan!  Your stir fry looks amazing!
4788 2018-03-29 14:31:57 Egyptian rice is short grain and pretty glutinous. It's made with 1.5 to 2 cups of water with a little oil at the bottom, stirred at first and then covered for ten, fifteen minutes. It ends up (or should end up. I'm not a very good cook xD) fluffy.

4825 2018-03-29 14:28:10 And even when they did...  had an oil exec tell me once that his idea of "long term planning" was five quarters ahead; after that he figgered he'd be in another job so consequences were someone else's problem.

4836 2018-03-29 14:27:37 Their logic is that Bell and Standard Oil were broken up and so why not Facebook, Google, Twitter and every other company that is "too big". Wait till they try that with Bitcoin, which they will without a doubt claim, "Threatens our democracy". Unethical and evil people!

4840 2018-03-29 14:27:11 'FG must have withheld support, if true, for a very good reason' - true. Like it had a good reason for paying SS 3% on revenue allocation for decades, the same non-conspiracy good reason for allocation oil rights. The FG always has a good reason, we just fail to see it.
4841 2018-03-29 14:27:09 For sure and "when interpreted correctly" is an enormous caveat. Concern is that when "research" is de facto "evidence" it opens the door to the snake oil you alluded to earlier. Few people take the time to explore the details as the process is tedious though necessary.

How many oil and gas vultures have you allowed to practically steal property--illegally--and you're trying to give me flack over an abando?

4905 2018-03-29 14:18:22 Good piece. The Energy Transition from fossil fuels to electricity is the long-term disruption, the transformation of the oil/gas business model by digital tech is the here and now disruption. It's early days, but watch AB energy employment struggle even as production rises.

4922 2018-03-29 14:16:29 What is going on with Trump? He can not single out one stock to denigrate when GE has notoriously never paid taxes and the oil companies get subsidies. if you want to change the law change the law.  What’s in his portfolio? This smacks of insider trading.

4926 2018-03-29 14:16:01 Really? He had to spend to get us out of a severe recession. He saved the auto industry, restored jobs, bolstered the stock market, reduced our dependence on foreign oil - and our gas prices were great! Trump’s tax scam has added a trillion to the deficit in just a few months...
4927 2018-03-29 14:15:42 Yeah bc Oil prices growed from 10 to 130 in the 2000s. Now Imagine all this Money wouldn't have been stolen. Russia could ne ahead of Poland or Chechz Rep today. Instead its 3rd world  outside Moscow centre and Petersburg
4928 2018-03-29 14:15:40 In an ironic twist, the Oil & Gas Industry's Fracking induces Global Warming which causes unprecedented Winter storms in the Atlantic...thereby causing the massive power outages.

4982 2018-03-29 14:07:09 That's OPEX,  doesn't take CAPEX into account,  and CAPEX is huge in oil and gas
4983 2018-03-29 14:06:56 It isnt bankrupt if you believe joe six pack shouldnt own the resources.  Because to “forgive” that debt after bankruptcy, the world bank etc will take our water and oil.

4987 2018-03-29 14:06:26 Also, land has little value. It's improvements, not resources that have value. One barrel of oil or 168 quarts is $60. One quart of improved motor oil is $5. It's the improvement of land through labor, not the land itself, that produces value. Land in nature is relatively cheap.
4988 2018-03-29 14:06:26 What about rising gas prices? AMERICA is purportedly become the largest oil producer in the World? How come AMERICANS aren't paying Texas gas prices? Oh, I forgot Corps and Rich "Assholes" live to financially "screw" AMERICANS.

5011 2018-03-29 14:04:00 Yes, but there are two big differences.
1. WTI is local to the production
2. WTI is a blend of Crudes that have a specification rather than being a specific single crude oil.
In place at expiration means the crude needs to be in the delivery tank when contract expires

Don’t act like livestock isn’t the largest cause of CO2 emissions.
5015 2018-03-29 14:03:44 ...and right there is the error you continue to make. Stop listening to oil companies and start listening to consumers. Don't like oil? Raise money for EV battery research and destroy Shell's business model. Otherwise, consumers like cars and need gasoline. You can't fight that.

5027 2018-03-29 14:01:24 I have been feeling tired and moody all the time lately and feel so much more energized in the mornings when I take vitamin B12 and primrose oil with my breakfast. Highly recommend if you constantly feel tired af 
5028 2018-03-29 14:01:17 Absolutely. But it could also simply be perceived shared interest.

The US is panicking because the Russians/Chinese are trading oil in Yuan rather than USD. They want to put pressure on Russia to stop.

Maybe some countries feel siding with the US is their best option.
5029 2018-03-29 14:01:15 But so be it, right? As long as we control the distribution of oil, make some profitable arms deals and so on? Those interests trump the suffering caused do they? Unless you're a raving psychopath, which I doubt you are, then you don't really believe what you're saying.
5030 2018-03-29 14:01:07 Alternatively, arguing about .005 vs .05, while not unimportant, is like changing the oil in your car while your tires are on fire.

Pub bias, researchers' df, etc. should be part of any discussion/estimation of expected benefits of difference statistical practices.

5067 2018-03-29 13:56:43 With the move of making payments for crude oil in YUAN by the world’s 2nd biggest economy, it won’t be an unhappening thing of it being established as a standard currency across globe provided it does the same for all other imports.

Big Oil & all retailers r getting more than the tax relief could ever give. Focus on your dwindling pocketbook.

5119 2018-03-29 13:51:13 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
5120 2018-03-29 13:51:07 Saudi, oil rich, but investing in the future. The US, coal corrupt, and burning up our climate @realDonaldTrump  $200B should be good for Chinese & Koreans
5121 2018-03-29 13:51:07 The difference is, now you can’t be made fun of if you’re fat. So people have no incentive to change.
5122 2018-03-29 13:51:04 Monopolies are never good and that’s where we’re heading. Standard Oil tried to run all the small gas stations out of business by selling gas below their cost to drive them out. Amazon doing the same now selling at a loss to gain more market share. He should be stopped!
5123 2018-03-29 13:51:03 Change the oil within the suggested service intervals. Checking and changing your oil and oil filter will help your engine and vehicle run smoothly. While changing your oil as required is important, using the manufacturer’s recommended oil for your vehicle can improve gas mileage

5133 2018-03-29 13:49:17 babagirls1 AdamCarollaShow   
Which brand of Castrol oil to use is up to you.  Castrol oils should be changed as recommended by the vehicle's owner’s manual or the oil life indicator for the type of service (normal or severe) that the vehicle is being operated under.
5134 2018-03-29 13:49:17 babagirls1 AdamCarollaShow  For a 2010 Mazda 6, as per Castrol's lube guide, API certified 5w20 oil is required for use in all temps so Castrol GTX ULTRACLEAN, GTX High Mileage, GTX MAGNATEC, EDGE, EDGE High Mileage or EDGE Extended Performance oils in 5W-20 may be used.
5135 2018-03-29 13:49:08 Not conspiracy theory at all.  Important change in flows.  Again, why would the US ever export oil for USD's it could print?  There's a big argument going on now w/Trump tariffs that the US having to export more is bad for the US...can't have it both ways

5137 2018-03-29 13:48:43 It's now final. The price of gas is now divested from the price of a barrel of oil. I want that EV, not to "save the planet" but to keep a vehicle on the road.

5140 2018-03-29 13:48:14 This is the same president who literally tweeted that the keystone pipeline would not only NOT be bad for the environment but that it would actually be GOOD. What that means no one knows but what we DO know is it leaked 250barrels of oil into N. Dakota a few months back.
5141 2018-03-29 13:48:13 Which brand of Castrol oil to use is up to you.  Castrol oils should be changed as recommended by the vehicle's owner’s manual or the oil life indicator for the type of service (normal or severe) that the vehicle is being operated under.

5148 2018-03-29 13:46:55 Ok, back from the mechanic. Lots to discuss. He fixed the wheel which was having a leak issue. The O ring to my oil catch is damaged, so that needs to be replaced. The major one is the line for my clutch is leaking and needs a full replacement :/
5149 2018-03-29 13:46:48 Christine was a big truck that burned oil. The window crank was gone so a pair of vice grips was permanently attached in its place, and the door was held shut with a bungee cord attached to the gear shift. But "there ain't nothing wrong with the radio" so I was fine with it.

5154 2018-03-29 13:46:21 This project will reduce the dependency on oil, also It is going to be a massive project.
5155 2018-03-29 13:46:21 The Arctic is truly a fragile eco-systems. The people of the Arctic are subsistence hunters. An oil spill would be detrimental. Greed truly is the root of all evil.

5157 2018-03-29 13:46:16 I can only imagine you have to take it easy with that oil lol cause you’ll start tripping 
5158 2018-03-29 13:46:13 That is legit one of the most stupid things. Just give it a factory oil cooler and make the pan out of steel or aluminum lol
5159 2018-03-29 13:46:10 You can't change your oil?
5160 2018-03-29 13:46:06 At 9:45am I got a correlation buy signal for the Crude Oil WTI Futures (CLK18) and USO on my software.
5161 2018-03-29 13:45:56 For a 2010 Mazda 6, as per Castrol's lube guide, API certified 5w20 oil is required for use in all temps so Castrol GTX ULTRACLEAN, GTX High Mileage, GTX MAGNATEC, EDGE, EDGE High Mileage or EDGE Extended Performance oils in 5W-20 may be used.
5162 2018-03-29 13:45:55 Quite possible. Captive hedge funds essentially operating a macro Saudi trading book across oil & products refinery & storage
5163 2018-03-29 13:45:49 Jojoba & almond oil give black skin a different kind of glow. It’s almost skinny chick seasonnnnnn. Belly shirts & daisy dukes all summer  cant wait to let my tattoos roast
5164 2018-03-29 13:45:39 I agree with you. Nowadays referred to Chelsea. They have won a huge amount of trophies versus previously since oil arrived. Same as city. All linked to.. you guessed it.. revenue!!
5165 2018-03-29 13:45:31 Ok takdehal. Aku nak 20% + managerial position. Kita buat argan oil pada harga mampu milik.

5168 2018-03-29 13:45:21 お前ら何してんだよ…
5169 2018-03-29 13:45:20 The fact that Kansas never made an album titled: "Oil Drills and Windmills" is upsetting.
5170 2018-03-29 13:45:14 Jasmine and peppermint oil both helped my headaches big time, feel better soon lovely 
5171 2018-03-29 13:45:02 Worked for oil companies for as chemical engineer, Tom you speak rubbish talk.
5172 2018-03-29 13:44:44 CBD oil made from hemp is amazing. Try the balms also. Great stuff.
5173 2018-03-29 13:44:33 NATO "hailed merchant vessels and boarded suspect ships, intervened to rescue civilians on stricken oil rigs and sinking ships and, generally, helped to improve perceptions of security."

So basically they hate sea pirates.  Still don't know wtf this has to do with Romania.
5174 2018-03-29 13:44:22 きょうのそれは調子良かった
5175 2018-03-29 13:44:18 Zion Oil is being biught out by hostil takeover anti Jew Muslims.   will they win ? In my opinion as a Christian .
5176 2018-03-29 13:44:01 People is dumb, most will think you mean BUY OIL.  I would go with NO GAS...or CHARGER.

5179 2018-03-29 13:43:47 One or two table spoons of castor oil mixed with a cup of orange juice will flush anything out of your system
5180 2018-03-29 13:43:44 ‘What are these jokes you speak of?’ A totally normal human between sips of wd40 oil

5185 2018-03-29 13:43:24 Denise Adams....take a deep breath, oil up and wait for me. Don’t use that cheap oil cupcake, cause it get sticky 
5186 2018-03-29 13:43:12 @thebestcloser #CloserNation I still can’t, for the life of me, understand why we didn’t take the oil after Iraq, etc. we deserved payment. They had no functioning govt so why didn’t we negotiate our payment in oil?
5187 2018-03-29 13:42:56 Red wine and hot coconut oil.
5188 2018-03-29 13:42:55 I need to get all of mine professionally sharpened.  I guess I could get a stone and some oil and do them on my own.

It's been proven to cure Alzheimer's

5193 2018-03-29 13:42:11 Probably ngl I think it’s construction work and they are after that oil
5194 2018-03-29 13:41:43 Η Motor Oil διαπραγματεύεται στα 18,38 ευρώ με απώλειες 1,71% όγκο 45 χιλ. τεμάχια και αποτίμηση 2,03 δισ. ευρώ
5195 2018-03-29 13:41:42 My dad tells me a story of an old oil dealer in the 60s or 70s. Would lift 55 gallon drums of oil into the back of customer trucks.
5196 2018-03-29 13:41:36 Yeah I agree - sort of - I mean everything they do we do or at least did. Don't forget about what western movements must look like to Russia. look at Afgahnistan fight to biuld an oil pipeline and how it lands in Georgia a country with american weapons and that sort of Jazz.
5197 2018-03-29 13:41:34 Aren't there a few more pressing things on his plate besides this? Oil paintings?
5198 2018-03-29 13:41:32 This system is really corrupt and always plays with the efforts of honest and hard working students.

If this kind of events occurs then what is the difference left between a "burning midnight oil candidate" and an "eleventh hour studying candidate"?

5202 2018-03-29 13:41:08 ...equally important, I find, is for companies to be honest on the labeling of food products...don't write in large letters: 'with honey and nuts' when in fact these only account for 1 or 2% of total ingredients. More important for consumers is sugar and oil(s) content..

5216 2018-03-29 13:39:44 Do your own research. If anyone tells you they know exactly where price is going and when - they are a snake oil salesman.
5217 2018-03-29 13:39:23 Just got a sales call for some snake oil and the salesman name was John Connor. Don't worry, i asked if he was sick of running from terminators and how the whole battle with skynet was going before I hung up on him

5222 2018-03-29 13:38:49 The ban was an economic nonsense from the off. The shale glut needs an outlet. Refineries running hot... oil gets shipped. You need a conspiracy theory about such a simple fact?
5223 2018-03-29 13:38:43 Time for direct action is now.  Going to paint 'George Dobell is Innocent' around Lords this summer and pour oil on the pitch (well it will do it some good).  Anyone got a crowdfunder set up for a defence fund yet...?
5224 2018-03-29 13:38:40 And also before the oil price tanked. There’s been no Brexit bounce for separation. Support for Indy and SNP is falling and Labour support improving.  Go figure.
5225 2018-03-29 13:38:39 I guess to me, Homeopathic conjures up images of shit that is supposed to work, but has no scientific evidence behind it. CBD oil has been tested successfully and shown to work in a controlled  environment. 
Unlike essential oils and salt rocks and shit.

5238 2018-03-29 13:36:02 I think I've found more than #UKOG but a lot less than Soco found in Vietnam. More oil leaked out if my motorcycle here than UKOG produced from BB.
5239 2018-03-29 13:35:58 I think it's obvious that all these ladies need a good...hot oil treatment.
5240 2018-03-29 13:35:49 @CNBC Why should Zuckerberg no inforont of Congress and get reprimanded like John Dingle  D_MI did to Tony the CEO of BP Oil. Embarassing.
5241 2018-03-29 13:35:47 yaaay, got an oil leak in my car and water in my phone screen - what a great start to a long weekend
5242 2018-03-29 13:35:37 Never used airfryers , how are the chips, without oil ?
5243 2018-03-29 13:35:33 But you have big oil  25 billion in tax cuts and the price of gas keeps rising! Tariffs are going to cause a rise in the price of consumer goods. So much damn winning I can't stand it anymore!!!
5244 2018-03-29 13:35:10 It’s hardly a surprise that Trump picked a lunatic like John Bolton to be his National Security Advisor. With an oil executive in charge of the EPA, an anti-intellectual debutante leading education, and a racist AG, Bolton is just the latest in a terrible pattern. #CabinetCrisis

5251 2018-03-29 13:34:34 A lot of Albertans agree. Building a refinery is an enormous cost..even in oil dollars, and takes more than 5 years, plus, NA has lots of capacity.  What we really need is a healthy political climate that supports business’. Ottawa and BC are bound and determined to kill that

5256 2018-03-29 13:33:11 Kennedy fell our of favor with the deep state for numerous reasons. First was striving for world peace, while pursuing an end to nuclear weapons. Secondly JFK was going after welfare for oil companies by reducing give aways in billions. Also refused to start WW3. Zero in common.
5257 2018-03-29 13:32:10 I love the Rangers, but the owners treat their fans like the parents who bought their kids ProPlayer jackets and passed them off as Starters. Oil is booming and our owners should be spending. #openingdayhottakes

5311 2018-03-29 13:31:24 "Never short oil on a Friday" guys just realized, "Hey, it's actually Friday today!" #CL_F
5312 2018-03-29 13:31:20 Thats OK. Oil and real estate were long overdue for a correction on the market; we need to reduce oil dependancy and house prices are too bloated. Good to see an up-tick in manufacturing which is a good financial/GDP indicator.

5315 2018-03-29 13:30:43 The prediction of a balanced Provincial budget in 2022 seems to be primarily premised on increasing revenues from oil sales, falling real public sector wages and public sector attrition in which more expensive older workers leave.

5322 2018-03-29 13:29:48 I like Mick but I’m worried he is secretly more of the same. He is strongly aligned with the oil and gas industry and doesn’t seem to actually stand for much of anything. I want him to be loud about what his vision is and he is just existing in the race.

5333 2018-03-29 13:28:52 Yes, we've written extensively about it over the years.  Do tell, why would the US Congress repeal a 40-yr old US oil export ban so that it could export oil for USD's that according to you, the US can still print ad infinitum?
5334 2018-03-29 13:28:41 Anybody remember the time that Barack Obama criticized BP while their oil rig was spewing crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico and conservatives went complete insane?

5368 2018-03-29 13:23:48 Yep. Just tonight heard a French party of four being asked if they wanted bottled water with their meal and they asked for tap water. Maybe we have more resources than oil, what do you think?

5372 2018-03-29 13:23:00 There's no risk that the UK economy won't have access to oil resources. The reason the UK supports brutal regimes is entirely over control of its distribution, ie profit maximisation. See Iran in 1953 as a textbook example.

5384 2018-03-29 13:21:57 Depends if more Middle Eastern producers sell their oil and take Yuan/Gold and how the USA responds to that.  The big question is whether Saudi Arabia will take Yuan and if China demands it eventually being the largest importer on the planet.

5391 2018-03-29 13:21:14 Yep, and since the UK economy needs oil to function one can extrapolate that the 'people' would be equally screwed if said resources weren't secured. I recognise that its geostrategic interests. I for one believe them to be as equally important as 'ordinary people'

5408 2018-03-29 13:19:14 Especially as those sectors that will become rule-takers are a much bigger deal to the UK economy than is the case in Norway, which has its oil revenue and national wealth fund to keep the economy ticking over.
5409 2018-03-29 13:18:56 no one cares but applying olive oil to your hair before you sleep and washing it off the next day makes your curls POP
5410 2018-03-29 13:18:44 I also know that that oil light isn’t going to turn itself off so since I’m not in school I should probably deal with that too.

5416 2018-03-29 13:17:41 I think the Tribulation could begin in our generation. However, I reject a pre-Tribulation gathering. The gathering (Mt 24:31) is at His post-Tribulation return (Mt 24:29-30). God opened my eyes years ago, and I want to help the wise virgins prepare their extra flasks of oil.

5418 2018-03-29 13:17:34 You're adopting establishment rhetoric at face value - 'security' simply means 'securing geostrategic interests' (of which oil is the major one, but not the only one). It doesn't mean security for ordinary people (whether British or elsewhere).

5627 2018-03-29 12:52:55 Agree overall. I love amazon and its innovation! But its gotta pay its share and stop co-opting state/local gov'ts. Standard Oil was awesome in efficiency and distribution of a valuable commodity, until it wasn't and was a monopoly. Amazon's getting close to being a monopoly.

5629 2018-03-29 12:52:32 Canada's economy was heavily reliant upon oil before prices crashed. You may have noticed Canadians are not sifting through trash for food, eating dogs and cats, and burning hyper-inflated currency for warmth, as in Venesuala...
5630 2018-03-29 12:52:30 the oil was discovered long ago that's why the Argentinian invaded in the 1st place
5631 2018-03-29 12:52:12 This will get you reelected, because much of Saskatchewan clings to the belief that climate change is unimportant on the prairies and we need another oil boom. 

It remains an irresponsible position. You have no vision or foresight, only a flawed petroleum Alberta dream.

I’d like to think he didn’t know what the weather report forecasted.

5677 2018-03-29 12:45:49 If their economy was driven by market forces rather than centrally controlled bureaucracy, it would have been diversified and agile enough to adapt to the fluctuations in the price of oil.

5719 2018-03-29 12:39:50 Its a different crude grade then WTI or Brent contract, may or may not pull on the other contracts to the downside as I think they will try and sink the price of that contract...but main driving force to focus on right now for oil

5785 2018-03-29 12:29:05 Isn't it like oil. we don't have any but Total controls a not negligeable % of the production we use. Or when Nestlé gets its hand on 10% of the world production of fresh water for the next 10 years.
5786 2018-03-29 12:28:53 but your point was that padd3 was falling therefore all light crude being absorbed. but it appears that crude is building in palaces and not in others. it is a big assumption to make that all light oil is being absorbed just from one data point

5842 2018-03-29 12:20:02 My top 3 choices for skin care idk what I’ll do without them:

5849 2018-03-29 12:18:58 I deny that it's a crisis.

This isn't different from the "peak oil" warning from the 70s; here we are again awash in oil, even becoming exporter of oil again. Crises are opportunities. It's not a crisis, and if it ever became one, it would become a profitable problem to solve.
5850 2018-03-29 12:18:53 It's weeks like this one that make me wish a social democracy would invade America & spread some actual democracy here much like we spread dictatorship to every country that won't give  their oil willingly except it would benefit American citizens, *sigh*

5852 2018-03-29 12:18:42 How much profit is being made out of NSea oil now then? How much tax revenue does that lead to? 
The court is yours....
5853 2018-03-29 12:18:41 3 firms that bought crude last year from U.S. emergency stockpiles, including Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B), Macquarie Group and PetroChina International America (NYSE:PTR), have raised concerns about dangerous levels of poisonous chemical hydrogen sulfide in the oil.

5855 2018-03-29 12:18:24 Only oil would be allowed, and only for 15 specific medical conditions. They're still terrified somebody might have a good time.
5856 2018-03-29 12:18:22 Yup mahal talaga kasi sa iba 2k lang eh. Pero kasi hindi nagpapachange oil sa labas sila mama.
5857 2018-03-29 12:18:11 No-one knows whether that is true or not. The UK government does not collect those statistics. It is at best a guess.

Note that according to the same set of guesses, England export more whisky than Scotland does, and most north sea oil is of 'unknown' origin.
5858 2018-03-29 12:17:23 High inflation rates, capital controls and financial repression had a lot to do with the fall. Plus North Sea oil revenues and the reversal of the post war decline after the UK joined the European Union. How many of those are about to be repeated?

5867 2018-03-29 12:16:26 Oil Tip of the Day 

For a relaxing foot bath, add a few drops in a large bowl of warm water, lemon or eucalyptus oil work great.
5868 2018-03-29 12:16:13 The extrange thing is that the guerrillas here blow up the oil conduction line and no one says anything. The spills are enourmous, the ecological damage is irreversible.
5869 2018-03-29 12:16:10 Perhaps. Would be good for our oil and gas industry. However with Liberals / socialists controlling BC, Alberta and nation, we can't capitalise.  Perhaps, you could lessen your PRESIDENT Trump bashing and focus on OUR situation.  Pres Trump is at least focused on the economy.

minyak zaitun bagus banget kok buat kulit. untuk pijat, dicampur ke scrub, sebagai masker, sebagai

5996 2018-03-29 11:55:42 The oil crisis (I assume this is what you mean) was a supply side problem, not demand side. The balance of payments is affected by how productive ur economy is. Which only emphasises the importance of eliminating unemployment and underemployment. And I mean to 0%.

6009 2018-03-29 11:54:18 Crude oil prices found support on the -3.47 million bbl draw in EIA gasoline supplies (vs expectations of -2.25 million bbl) and the increase in the crack spread to a 4-1/2 month high, which gives an increased incentive to refineries to purchase crude oil to refine into gasoline.

6038 2018-03-29 11:48:42 As the economy grew on many fronts the past few years, oil really lagged.  We have 261 oil based firms in the Global 5000 -- their total revenue fell by 16% over the past 3 years.  These are giants like Saudi Aramco, China National, Shell, Exxon, BP, et al  Amazing macro shifts
6039 2018-03-29 11:48:38 Disagree :). We don't want to replace one import dependence (oil) with another, especially not from China. And low bids were nonsense anyway, about time reality struck. RE producers have had their cake & got to eat it for too long.

6117 2018-03-29 11:31:32 We have seen how Govt spent lavishly during the good times when oil prices were high..with no contingent plans for a possible downturn in oil prices.

When oil prices went south...they had no choice but to hit the rakyat with GST to keep Gov finances in order.

-Tamanu Oil (use as your daily facial moisturizer accompanied by SPF,at all times)
-Lemon brightening overnight serum (use daily at night after cleansing) & Green Tea Exfoliating Scrub (use once/twice a week)
6122 2018-03-29 11:30:40 I don't think you can characterise Modi as sincere. Demonstration was not thought out .GST implementation was rushed. Both combined to kill small businesses. Our macro figures are pathetic considering good monsoons , no national calamities and relatively benign oil prices 1/2
6123 2018-03-29 11:30:26 While they loose some transaction cost in coversion making it less profitable. Therefore limitted effect to WTI and USD but positive effect for domestic oil producers in China

6126 2018-03-29 11:29:13 Not sure why I’m so giggly this morning, but I’m literally laughing out loud at memes in the waiting room while getting my oil changed. The guy next to me goes..

“Okay let me see” 
6127 2018-03-29 11:29:05 Wow! 
I can't wait to join you and get a heat pump this year. 
It's incredible how energy efficiency measures are such a win-win action for the climate, air quality, and reducing our dependence on the oil & gas industry (all while saving money!).
6128 2018-03-29 11:29:05 Indonesia had granted permission to PT Surya Mina Asinusa in 2015 for construction of oil storage facilities on Nipah Island in an attempt to prevent the island from “erosion”.  Reality is that China needed a central gateway to store cheap oil it was buying.
6129 2018-03-29 11:28:50 Interesting video.

So the sheer amount of oil bunkering currently going on is probably what's causing the soot? Maybe the method of bunkering has changed as well? Cos it's never been this bad. 

I'm very curious as to why @GovWike & @MBuhari continue to be silent on this issue

6744 2018-03-29 09:19:47 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.

6748 2018-03-29 09:19:23 True. Making the oil industry unattractive through regulation would make a difference. Easier said than done effectively though.

7104 2018-03-29 08:00:13 Im optimistic. Renewable energy is making great strides and the moment it is competitive with oil it will take over. Also birth rates are down worldwide because as living standard rise and become more expensive they drop off. This the best time to be alive in human history.
7105 2018-03-29 07:59:51 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.

7129 2018-03-29 07:53:23 *sigh* Yes, Alberta spent wayyyy too much, esp. on salaries and pensions for bloated civil service and transfer payments to Quebec - still, however, the question is why are we happily buying oil from tankers from Saudi Arabia instead of our own producers?

7199 2018-03-29 07:39:00 @BBCNews #bbcbizlive Too many Easter eggs made with palm oil (listed as vegetable oil) & masses of sugar. Artisan eggs made with high quality chocolate with just cocoa butter (no palm oil) and less sugar. They might be expensive but they are healthier (not healthy as have sugar)

7205 2018-03-29 07:37:56 If able, everyone needs to au pair. Or leave the country. Or go to Europe. Specifically, go to southern Italy and try the olive oil. This world is wild

7214 2018-03-29 07:36:04 My mom worked as a machinist and got a skin infection from cutting oil, ate away just the fat layer on her hands, wrists and lower forearms. She went through a year of different treatments until she went through home remedies.
7215 2018-03-29 07:35:53 Shame on you @KElectricPk . Other countries are producing electricity from waste and other methods and here you guys are producing it from gas and oil. Poor people of rich country.
7216 2018-03-29 07:35:46 Miss the point though. Data is the new oil when you consider the value of interpreting it faster than anyone else - old data is no where near as valuable, but I'd argue there is a huge value in near real time, contextual information
7217 2018-03-29 07:35:38 I already know  go to bed I’ll be to see you tomorrow after I get a oil change.... it’s on me this time 
7218 2018-03-29 07:35:27 How cool to see. The nation that probably has the most to loose from an end to oil is ready to embrace renewable energy. Puts us to shame. I hope the world can unite against the treat to all of us. Would like to see a 350 palastine and 350israel fighting as one. To much to dream?

7246 2018-03-29 07:30:26 You do know that they use palm oil in these.... ??
7247 2018-03-29 07:30:16 Do you know how supply is growing? US may become largest producer, and most other oil producers must sell oil to eat.

7250 2018-03-29 07:29:34 They surprisingly aren't dry. I think that's because they use palm oil.
7251 2018-03-29 07:29:23 I just had a strange thought.  What if someone made peanut butter using coconut oil instead of peanut oil?

7273 2018-03-29 07:25:13 that's part of the problem. It became this cure all oil on the market and people started slathering it all over their face not realizing that's what is causing their breakouts. Hell, it could cause body breakouts if your skin can't handle it there either.

7282 2018-03-29 07:23:50 @burnie you were actually right on the podcast, WD40 is NOT a lubricant. It can do stuff that lubricants do temporarily, but that's because it dissolves rust and gunk. WD40 alone will not suffice, you'll need to follow up with oil of some kind.

7314 2018-03-29 07:15:57 Right, so the relevant oil price metric may be the marginal extraction cost to Saudi instead. Over 12 years though, a very low value being set on the oil is going to reduce even Saudi production. I still think solar curtailment is a *shrug* here.
7315 2018-03-29 07:15:46 Holy Week ceremonies for Catholics include a Chrism Mass.

At the Chrism Mass priests renew the promises made on their ordination day and the Holy Oil used to consecrate and fortify the people of God in the sacraments is blessed.

7325 2018-03-29 07:11:55 My point is, it's debatable if we should compare solar cost to market price of oil saved, since Saudi isn't constrained by reserves or production capacity. Particularly if you think peak oil demand is fairly imminent
7326 2018-03-29 07:11:53 @Nouriel in firechat  with @arvindsubraman . Two great economists, great conversation. #ICE . Medium to long term oil prices should be better. Short term, there could be some supply side shocks.

7390 2018-03-29 06:56:48 FYI Crued oil is expected to reach $200 in few years .. but the whole purpose of solar energy project in SA is to cover the high demand of energy in SA with considerably lower production prices than oil produced energy and save almost $40 billion annually.
7391 2018-03-29 06:56:29 This is the sector the govt and influential citizens are making money.The issue of transperancy& accountability will break even if only govt is allowed to control oil/gas sector not private individuals.
7392 2018-03-29 06:56:22 @NTAGMN Oil and Gas companies must be encouraged to join sector initiatives to promote transparency and must be willing to open their activities for public scrutiny.

7409 2018-03-29 06:51:27 Once the USD loses its supremacy as the dominate currency used for oil trading it will no longer be the world’s reserve currency. Thus destroying the little “value” it has left. China just opened trade for oil futures that are denominated in Yuan instead of USD.

7557 2018-03-29 06:22:43 so, these are all inputs for key industries (wisconsin has Land's End.) But the oil importing states -- is that crude (and if so, could it be simply a pipeline transiting to a refinery in Texas?) or finished products--gas/diesel?

7652 2018-03-29 06:06:11 The truth must be told, there is public discontent over the lack of national development based on the earning potential from the oil sector, evident by the continuous domestic fuel shortages experience particularly in festive periods. This must change! Nigerians deserve better!

But let me explain. The pipeline itself will contribute very little to the B.C. economy, with the oil being shipped to China to be refined, so few jobs are created. (Con’t...)

8273 2018-03-29 04:08:24 Yeah, I think it’s like oil. You can obviously have expensive pumping process but you will be kicked out of the market. Just pumpin oil is not enough.

8337 2018-03-29 03:59:07 I’ve seen chefs liberally use the combo of an herb, nut, cheese and fine oil and call it Pesto.

8344 2018-03-29 03:57:57 Is it too much to ask for a good source on what foods are high in omega 6? I just realized artichoke hearts I get are marinated in sunflower oil, gross. I know veg oils (ex olive and avocado) are high but are there others? I was surprised peanut oil was high.
8345 2018-03-29 03:57:55 “and you need some oil.”

8358 2018-03-29 03:56:20 I have big pores, redness, and acne (well not acne anymore) so my toner has glycerin (2$), tea tree oil (8-10$ that will last FOREVER), raw apple cinder vinegar (2$), witch hazel (1$), and filtered water.
8359 2018-03-29 03:56:20 It's not true that Norway has nationalized oil and gas. Private sector is a big player. 

I like the Norwegian model. Good for Norway and good for investors and good for the environment.
8360 2018-03-29 03:55:39 Mix witch hazel and lavender oil together in a spray bottle or whatever container you prefer and spray/put it on your skin it really helps get rid of pimples.
8361 2018-03-29 03:55:33 Oh shit, so I had seen the litecoin symbol, but hadn’t noticed it was on an “oil mining rig”. Nice.
8362 2018-03-29 03:55:31 Nah, the reason I ask is because brushing your teeth is implicitly fighting against an inevitable result: Your teeth will get plaque and tartar on them. Ethics in investing is the same way. Why do you think there are specific funds to avoid investing in tobacco/oil?

I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.

8481 2018-03-29 03:37:02 Stupid oil heater, freezing my ass off until tomorrow... good thing it's not too cold. Plus side one more work day until it's Friday
8482 2018-03-29 03:37:00 There was an oil flood tonight. Look at the stain on my shirt. Lol.
8483 2018-03-29 03:36:32 To say it is hypercritical is like the oil baron saying "well didn't you come here in a car today". It is not all or nothing debate but about self-awareness.  We have gain new skills (like crap detection) exactly like we had to do when the printing press came along.
8484 2018-03-29 03:36:32 so you can put blunt power in a oil diffuser and use it as you would an oil..

You’re welcome
8485 2018-03-29 03:36:22 If I were you I’d see if those colleges were paid off by the NRA to reject you college applications. Don’t trust any of them. That’s how big oil shuts down any green energy companies that would threaten their bottom line. If they did you would have a lawsuit. Keep it up

8487 2018-03-29 03:36:17 I work in the oil and gas industry in Texas. We are all pretty conservative.
8488 2018-03-29 03:36:10 人権がある帰宅時間で嬉しい
8489 2018-03-29 03:36:10 Do you mean other than the various marketing boards that set prices regardless of supply / demand, the unending $$$ for "private" oil companies, and have-not designation until recently? I think Westerners have benefited per capita more than others.
8490 2018-03-29 03:36:07 I can’t wait to post the discussion with my mechanic about my oil change.  Just buy a new phone.  You can use your NRA money for that.

8494 2018-03-29 03:36:00 Oil change ma 
8495 2018-03-29 03:35:54 This hot ass weather has my face feeling and looking like a damn oil slick
8496 2018-03-29 03:35:53 I read 5+ recipes for breakfast potatoes and eggs but still ended up winging it and adding sesame oil (coz I was craving for it since yesterday)
8497 2018-03-29 03:35:52 I just use all oil free face stuff: wash, makeup, moisturizer. Anything with oil will take off the adhesive glue.
8498 2018-03-29 03:35:45 someone had suggested to use peppermint oil on my stomach for cramps!!!! that was not fun!

8504 2018-03-29 03:35:16 most of our super wealthy didn't make money from building the railroads or refining oil they made it from manipulating a financial system that's been rigged in their favor. they're parasites, they've sold out our nation for their own gain and they're first up against the wall
8505 2018-03-29 03:35:07 An illuminating facial mask, light yellow, with saffron, rosewood oil, and exfoliating French rock salt. It comes as a smooth liquid.
8506 2018-03-29 03:34:54 Our furnace ran out of oil today, so it has been quite cold in our house all day, and it’s only going to get colder tonight, so of course this is perfect timing for my heater to stop working too 
8507 2018-03-29 03:34:53 Crazy fact...Most of the oil and gas companies are actually better known as energy companies....They provide energy...and they have plenty of money tied up in renewables like solar and wind as well. So for that reason, I agree.
8508 2018-03-29 03:34:38 j'ai pris ma douche, j'ai mangé une mangue, je me suis mis du coconut oil partout sur le corps et j'écoute du Steve Lacy. demain est une nouvelle journée, la vie est belle, bonne nuit mes enfants

8511 2018-03-29 03:34:08 It's actually not even oil at all.  It's energy.  Burning that energy..

8515 2018-03-29 03:33:41 The PUNTER BARRIER BPM live disc from the Midnight Oil OVERFLOW TANK is one of those “how could they have been this good?” live albums. Listening to the songs from the Tanelorn fest in 1981 is almost a religious experience
8516 2018-03-29 03:33:29 lavender oil . . .
8517 2018-03-29 03:33:24 it’s just another one of those key nutrients that leads to better hormonal and chemical balances, effecting mood, energy, and overall cognitive function. I’ve tried fish oil but the pills leave a fishy aftertaste and it’s kinda terrible
8518 2018-03-29 03:33:21 i asked for salt pepper oil n vinegar on my sandwhich but the bitch put vinaigrette instead so now it tastes like a rly gross salad

8530 2018-03-29 03:31:30 On the other hand, Paraffin oil, known as kerosene in Australia and the United States and stove oil in Canada, is an flammable liquid hydrocarbon burned as fuel. It is most commonly used to power jet engines for aircraft, but can also be used for heating, lighting, and cooking.
8531 2018-03-29 03:31:29 That is heavy. Its funny how perception is, I don't see all Christians like that and I definitely empathize with the ones that he used and sold snake oil to. I just hope they take that into account at the polls next time around.
8532 2018-03-29 03:31:22 I like it when guys open the door for me, help me carry heavy things, help me open my oil cap, walk me to my car at night etc. It’s not because I think that my sex is inferior or that it must be my place as a woman, it’s really because...

I’m weak as shit bitch I got bird bones
8533 2018-03-29 03:31:11 Nooo!! Mine have grown sooo long because I don’t wear makeup that damages them. But they’re tedious to take care of... no oil products, no sleeping on your side/face, sweating weighs them down, etc.
8534 2018-03-29 03:31:11 Coconut oil is amazing. I've had severely dry skin, including on my face, since I was probably 12. I think this might finally be the cure.
8535 2018-03-29 03:31:08 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, however however many there may be.

Zama black soap( it doesn't work for everyone but it's worth a shot) and Aztec Indian healing clay mask  and something to tshasa. I use tea tree oil.

8555 2018-03-29 03:27:03 Lavender is my favorite essential oil. Eucalyptus was the first essential oil I ever got, so it does hold a special place in my heart.

8570 2018-03-29 03:25:25 You want sanctions.  We’ve implemented the largest sanctions against Russia in decades; plus we’re destroying their economy by pumping cheap oil into Europe; and now kicking their officials out of USA...that’s the best start since the Cold War.

2. Cook til mostly brown

3. Add spinach and whatever seasoning you can find

4. Cook til all brown

5. Serve hot, chase with PBR
8592 2018-03-29 03:22:26 Throwback to the time I was breaking out really really bad and I said to Eli "idk why I'm breaking out so bad:(" and I was literally about to put coconut oil on my face & he was like "um the coconut oil is breaking you out", thanks for saving my skin @EliahsSumpter

8599 2018-03-29 03:21:34 The planet is warming.  You don't need the scientists to tell you when you look at where all the polar ice has been for so long.  They have found mastadons frozen in it.  So why would we need to drill for more oil when it is imperative that we use less?  Only runaway capitalism.
8600 2018-03-29 03:21:31 OOF I KNEW I did damn I’m sorry djdkfkf 
I did 4-y since the height is 4 and you want to find the distance to pump the oil to the top so you can’t automatically assume it’s 2 (Half the height) even tho it said half full so I used y as a variable? Did that make sense idek

8605 2018-03-29 03:20:25 so true, there needs to be so much education on this. people, even educated ones lack a clear understanding of the fullness and importance of oil.  Keep up the good fight against ignorance and assumptions based on lack of full knowledge.
8606 2018-03-29 03:20:24 Also look into murad products they are sold at ulta and any massage envy and have great acne products also I'm pretty sure they have a vitamin oil
8607 2018-03-29 03:19:51 England profits significantly from our oil & gas. We even provide water to parts of your country. Despite the scare stories I believe we've got everything to gain from leaving while you're frankly left to stagnate.

Yes, England runs my country. As I said, we need to kick you out

8632 2018-03-29 03:15:22 @SimonMatijas not that #bcpoli needs many oil, gas or coal-fired power plants to meet its domestic electricity needs when it/we already have so many great clean renewable hydro sources, which make our carbonics eminently exportable (and #abpoli's dilbit and BC's coming #LNG)

8642 2018-03-29 03:14:17 He balanced nothing. But he did pay off his PC/oil cronies, sold off ALL our fee-generating assets to his buddies at fire sale prices, put zero into the Heritage Fund, let the infrastructure slide into an abysmal state.

8659 2018-03-29 03:12:07 Dak is dual threat like my car: it burns oil and leaks oil.

8666 2018-03-29 03:11:10 What I find interesting is no one is talking about the new Petro Dollars from China and Russia that sent crude oil up $6 a barrel and could very well lead to inflation here in the U.S.A. and knock out the U.S. Dollar. @realDonaldTrump
8667 2018-03-29 03:11:10 its called oil.. that what Saudis use to  get thier way on things..

8680 2018-03-29 03:09:18 Every province has debt. We have less because oil pays for things we need. If we paid for the costs of our benefits, we would have zero debt and great services. Alberta is in a unique position to actually do that. I don’t mind paying. Sorry you want free stuff.

8838 2018-03-29 02:44:53 No shock to me.  It is only going to get worse. After giving oil companies a tax break the price of gas is starting to go up. With climate change, food is going to cost more and that so-called tax break is just another Trump lie.

8857 2018-03-29 02:42:29 You did not break any laws. You gave a review and didn't tell any of your viewers to do anything. Besides, what kind of mechanic doesn't check the oil and send you on your way without any in your car?

8922 2018-03-29 02:32:46 Even SAGD installation have to continue to inject steam which is a cost, it takes months to warm up some installations. You can't just shut it down, and if Keystone is for any reason not available, then we still need to put the oil somewhere. A single buyer is never good.

8924 2018-03-29 02:32:24 I’ve eaten half a pound of bacon so far this week and I’ve used all of the grease as an oil substitute for other dishes. My cholesterol is probably soooo bad lol #HeartAttackInbound #WorthItThough
8925 2018-03-29 02:32:19 Everybody’s gotta have a gimmick. Gypsy Rose Lee taught us that way back in the 40s & 50s. Trump has his schtick (slick con man snake oil salesman in a fancy suit). Tucker has his (white men are being left behind & discriminated against). Sad part? Poorly educated lap it up.

RT @ElleWCarter: I've been moisturizing my body all wrong. i'm supposed to put on lotion first, THEN oil.

8930 2018-03-29 02:31:26 Totally tried oil pulling. And it's really exhausting cause you're supposed to do it for like 10 minutes. My jaw used to get so sore!!!
8931 2018-03-29 02:31:20 I have coconut oil on my hand.

8940 2018-03-29 02:29:54 I just wanna thank my twitter friends for the great insight on CBD oil, I am so excited to try it out. Updates to come
8941 2018-03-29 02:29:52 * Jamaican Black castor oil thank me later
8942 2018-03-29 02:29:47 Also, it's not even a question of getting a better price but any price. Alberta is severely lacking pipeline capacity, and an oil field that is producing must produce. You can't just shut it off, that damages/destroys the field, so the oil must go somewhere.
8943 2018-03-29 02:29:37 Despite inopportune entry, am staying with my gold and oil shorts.  Patience is key.  Stops are wide.  DXY may be about to melt up.  Went long SPX at 2621 for a scalp but that may have been ill-advised.  Always learning, never ever stop learning.  $GLD $Oil $SPX

They don’t like peppermint oil and tea tree oil so I’m trying to keep the baseboards covered.

8951 2018-03-29 02:28:49 Not voting is probabaly the worst thing people can do so its on the shoulders of our society for being complacent. And again more than right, this issue is practically meaningless if you consider the degree of corporate entrenchment in politics; I’m speaking big oil and banks

8953 2018-03-29 02:28:21 Fake News!  Eastern Canada buys foreign oil now and pays less than we do in BC! Energy companies are gouging Canadians while Americans pays 30% less for gas??? Disgusting ripoff!
8954 2018-03-29 02:27:59 U need an attorney cause they ripped you off!
Have ssraven checks by Certified mechanic to make sure all the work was done and it was done right!

8966 2018-03-29 02:26:23 Don't address this to me. I thought that the man who threw the shoes was doing a great thing for humanity! I'm totally ANTI military and especially the wanton killing of innocents for oil and minerals. My profile clearly states RT≠ agreement.
8967 2018-03-29 02:26:18 No. Oklahoma has the lowest oil production taxes in the entire nation. It is not even half of the next lowest of Texas. Meanwhile, the Dakotas are rolling in dough for social services while Oklahoma has four day school weeks and teachers have to work two to three jobs to survive.

8981 2018-03-29 02:23:47 Norway is one country that like Alberta is lucky with oil, but Canada as a whole doesn't have this luxury as resources fall under provincial jurisdiction.  Also Norway has a centre-right govt at the moment and is lowering their taxes.
8982 2018-03-29 02:23:46 “@Son_ImSleep: Dawg idc if my car is on fire bro I came here for an oil change, nothing else” 
8983 2018-03-29 02:23:39 Lead by example. Don’t make me laugh. Do you actually think the US or China cares what we do? China the biggest emitter is building 700 new coal plants & US will reach 10 million BPD oil production soon. Save the world? Talk to them.
8984 2018-03-29 02:23:27 I found the article after 2011, about the deal California made with Saudi Arabia for oil. The reason I was concerned was because it was in my Middle East Security class where they did an attack on me. This is big...
8985 2018-03-29 02:23:24 I just realized Karn planeswalked with the oil he didn't know he was carrying. That means he was in the Blind Eternities for a non zero amount of time with it. You know who lives there? Eldrazi. You know what that means?

8995 2018-03-29 02:22:30 Have you ever seen what an abandoned well looks like? It looks like an overgrown field with some shutdown equipment on it. We are not talking an oil strewn wasteland. And KM is a pipeline, does the existing line look like a garbage dump?

9006 2018-03-29 02:21:07 So what's your argument? That inconvenience due to weather means we shouldn't do it? Cleaning panels is far less maintenance than maintaining oil wells.

9074 2018-03-29 02:09:45 yeah but it's lemon dill and olive oil. not water. so I drain the oil and then mix it into the noodles and it's pretty good. I'm tryna cut out red meat, but I don't have time (aka I'm lazy) to prep real seafood.

9078 2018-03-29 02:09:06 There isn't much English-language quantitative work on Russian politics. The general consensus is that Putin did do some things to improve the Russian economy (flat tax, deregulation, budget surpluses), but the moderate improvement was mostly a function of rising oil prices.
9079 2018-03-29 02:08:46 @aveda Hello, do any of your products contain palm oil?

9082 2018-03-29 02:08:32 So I started taking CBD oil about 4 weeks ago for the chronic pain in my neck and shoulder. It worked pretty well, but I ran out about 2 weeks ago. I’ve discovered something about myself I didn’t know. I have a lot of anxiety they the CBD was taking care of. Who knew!
9083 2018-03-29 02:08:30 @realDonaldTrump @WashTimes @TIME @StateDept @statedeptspox US has a greater plan than them,  but US is cautious about oil prices going crazy
9084 2018-03-29 02:08:30 Their main source of revenue is from oil. Can India offer to have 0 gst seeing Arabian nations? No. We can't. We shouldn't  compare blindly, need to consider a comprehensive taxation picture applicable to a country.
9085 2018-03-29 02:08:29 Start eating earlier in the day, adding high calories foods like healthy fats (nuts, avocados, coconut oil) and then white potatoes/rice are high carb. Maybe set your food up so you know how much you need to eat in a day using a food app

9095 2018-03-29 02:07:35 658, but shot only a 188 in the first game with the Rebel.  It was climbing too quickly and I switched to the Scandal and then dropped a 234 and 236.  The Rebel should be nice to try this weekend on the Bear oil pattern (I Hope).

9105 2018-03-29 02:05:40 Yeah it is bro, the one I have is $8 and the ingredients are vitamin e, rosehip, and jojoba oil that’s it
9106 2018-03-29 02:05:39 The Palm oil business is a wonderful idea. However, it must be private sector driven. Otherwise, politicians will soon turn it to an avenue to further loot the "Commonwealth". Corruption is killing good initiatives in this country. Sigh!

9169 2018-03-29 01:57:54 @realDonaldTrump It’s time to have one price for oil for the US, and another for the rest of the world. We need to sell more oil internally. So that the price that were charging internally is less than the price that we charge externally. Reduce reliance on foreign oil.

9200 2018-03-29 01:53:41 Is there an ‘easy way’ to point friends to ‘man-made climate change’? I’ve even tried ‘you trust doctors with your health and mechanics w/ car, why distrust this class of experts? It’s not as if there’s even a myth of an oil exec who cares about humanity.

9210 2018-03-29 01:52:33 Again, World oil demand is increasing every year. Obstructing Canada’s oil only makes Canada poorer while enriching some very evil regimes. Canada’s Oil is more moral than dictator oil and should be sold to the world. We have a choice.

9233 2018-03-29 01:48:30 The only “scientists” that have denied it are those paid for by big oil.  Look it up, it’s something like a 99:1 ratio of scientists who do believe in climate change versus those who do not.  Clearly the propaganda is working or it’s just that science and facts are too liberal.
9234 2018-03-29 01:48:07 March 28 - 5.2mb SPR oil sold. "SPR crude oil offered for sale was up to seven (7) million barrels.  delivery period for this sale shall be May 1-May 14, 2018 (site 1)and May 1-May 31, 2018 (site 2).  early delivery in April is encouraged to the maximum extent possible."

9373 2018-03-29 01:26:25 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.

9377 2018-03-29 01:25:57 They're running out of oil, and the modern generation of royalty realizes that once its gone, they won't be royal any more. So they have to make major cultural changes, giving up tidbits of control, to stay in power. Its not going to work.
9378 2018-03-29 01:25:55 What's being hidden on the oil&gas side? The Nalcor review is 33M and what will it FIX? Nothing for this project.  Do the review when you have $$ in the bank. That's 33M that could go to education, healthcare, infrastructure. Tangibles.
9379 2018-03-29 01:25:51 don't use sea salt to clean them . trust me only use bactine spray and tea tree oil . use both of those together until they heal in 6 months

9404 2018-03-29 01:21:35 They survived changing oil, brake pads, brake discs and some other minor bullshit many a time. I'm sure I could adjust!

9420 2018-03-29 01:19:33 Ironically, there are quite a few pockets of Oil in Mexico, especially around Tabasco, but Mexico has halted extraction for some reason. Maybe that's why Trump wants a wall... Mexico are not feeding the USA's oil addiction 
9421 2018-03-29 01:19:26 If we would have taken the oil, you wouldn't have ISIS.

9429 2018-03-29 01:18:20 I don’t think that cooking sprays are healthy for us or the environment. I’ll use olive oil in a spritz bottle.

9434 2018-03-29 01:17:45 So Trump wants to shrink two national park sites because of oil. Well at least we're invading our own country for oil now. 
Just wait till they shrink Yellowstone,  you'll see fire and fury the world has never seen before.
9435 2018-03-29 01:17:44 Just trying to get my oil changed and their tv is playing @NatGeo and I totally just involuntarily watched an entire cow birth a calf. I now explicitly know what that looks like.

9437 2018-03-29 01:17:24 They just raise fees and talk to the oil companies to raise gas prices to gain all the extra revenue. If they mentioned tax hike it would be another nail in the coffin!

9442 2018-03-29 01:17:07 Hmm, reading its through 2022 at least, and there're still credits & tax breaks for gas stations for blending pumps. However I don't favor subsidies for the oil industry either, they ought stop them as well. but at least oil doesn't harm engines.

9471 2018-03-29 01:14:09 No honestly.. when you use oil and do oil pulling to clean your face then you don’t need lotion. Most lotions aren’t good for your face anyways bc they are too heavy and clog your pores.

9500 2018-03-29 01:10:17 thats the main guess!!! most people think its oil!!! it is acrylic but also not? its acryl gouache!! which is basically fake gouache!!! they're typically used for very very flat and opaque paintings! they dry matte too so there's no shine! (when dry)

9511 2018-03-29 01:09:25 Day 3 of CBD oil - worked wonders easing the pain to a level more tolerable. Stiffness & fatigue down significantly.

9514 2018-03-29 01:09:19 There's a natural spray out there with peppermint oil and cloves.  Works pretty good, cats smell good and applied every 2weeks or so.

9516 2018-03-29 01:08:50 Fun fact - RFS doesn’t have an expiration. When the oil industry loses its subsidies & allows retailers to offer whatever they want, we can talk.

9525 2018-03-29 01:07:27 It feels like it's just a way to avoid a McDavid vote by media members who realize their votes will be public this year. If the Oil were in, the argument of Drai at a ppg or near would be their issue.

9527 2018-03-29 01:07:09 Hi!!! I just searched my @ and “hydrating” and saw your tweet. The Hada Labo isn’t a toner, it’s a hydrator :) the oil + sunscreen combo might make you look oily for sure. I would skip the oil and use a sunscreen moisturizer.
9528 2018-03-29 01:06:47 it looks like oil to me!! but i think you've said before you use acrylic?

9550 2018-03-29 01:04:26 Both great threads. Makes me think of the recent reactions to Shell’s Sky Scenario analysis. Two main camps: 1) commending Shell for the quality of the analysis or 2) outcry that we shouldn’t reward an oil company for acknowledging basic facts.

9649 2018-03-29 00:51:06 @toshamack_ent told the TL to put castor oil on your lashes to make them grow, & baby, it is working. $9 for a little kit with brushes from Amazon. Thank you, my girl! 
9650 2018-03-29 00:51:04 So many sad-looking droids waiting for their owners outside the cantina. They should at least bring them a bowl of oil.
9651 2018-03-29 00:51:04 Big oil connections? Known anti EPA?
9652 2018-03-29 00:51:03 This baking brownies is for the birds —— adding eggs, oil, and water to a dry mix is hard 
9653 2018-03-29 00:50:46 Taking the oil is a war crime.  They did it because they wanted to for years and ginned up an excuse...  probably a lot of truth to the "fix a mistake" theory.  Either way, it made a huge mess on many levels and was our biggest mistake ever probably (until we let Trump "win").
9654 2018-03-29 00:50:20 Last shift here in the Newfoundland oil sands.home time in about 11 hours.
9655 2018-03-29 00:50:13 I cut primary heating energy (oil) by 60% with system upgrade, insulation, hex cell window shades, new windows, sweaters. Ground source heat pump w/solar is goal.
9656 2018-03-29 00:50:11 Sometimes, yes. Where you're quite incorrect is when you say there hasn't been a War since Vietnam. There are a few that you're forgetting. Afghanistan is Americas longest war, and Afghanistan didn't even have a means for oil production until 3 years ago.
9657 2018-03-29 00:50:05 It will be interesting to see who the players vote the Lindsay for though. McDavid's the only reason why many of us Oil fans even watched games this year or have game tickets.
9658 2018-03-29 00:50:03 So do you use coconut oil or what type of fat is in a #vegan #fudge?
9659 2018-03-29 00:50:02 What’s a good brand of like raw organic coconut oil..?
9660 2018-03-29 00:49:59 @AnnaVocino @VillaCappelli Any suggestions on how to get my olive oil from the 3 L tin to a decanter without making a big mess and wasting olive oil?
9661 2018-03-29 00:49:54 Cindi, Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off Buildings. Pls tell @vancouverpride how u rationalize obstructing  Gay friendly Oil while enriching Gay killing oil @VictoriaPride
9662 2018-03-29 00:49:39 Well now that I have about 2 months before we move to OK Falls I went out and bought close to $300 in oil paints and brushes . My other supplies are boxed up and stored in a big metal box . So . YIPPIE . Time to paint . I`m going to continue a painting I started back in October .
9663 2018-03-29 00:49:36 Oil doesn't explode so...
9664 2018-03-29 00:49:32 Nice. Today’s better, I think i started w too much    oil.
9665 2018-03-29 00:49:30 Intake manifold and throttle body gasket and vacuum hoses + oil and filter = $320 yup that’s it , shop would charge $670
9666 2018-03-29 00:49:18 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. Yet they are starving due to their socialism. BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America
9667 2018-03-29 00:49:17 Yes, When I was a young lad living in England, they were just starting the metric system.  So you purchased most liquids in Imperial measurements,  Petrol had already been converted to liters.  I remember that I could purchase motor oil by Imperial gallon.
9668 2018-03-29 00:49:05 Drill baby drill. Wrecking Russian oil revenues. You’re some kind of dumb
9669 2018-03-29 00:49:05 Well India's oil import increased to 82% in 2017 fueled by strong demand. On the ground decreasing oil import is hard especially for growing economy. Also if we are looking at becoming manufacturing leaders, energy requirements would be enormous causing imports to rise as well.
9670 2018-03-29 00:48:56 Too bad we don't have the fancy chilli oil lol
9671 2018-03-29 00:48:53 the US oil meme is my new brand
9672 2018-03-29 00:48:47 it only takes some coconut oil, lip gloss, and the nearest window during the daytime for y’all to have a bare face 
9673 2018-03-29 00:48:36 Just wanna say thanks to @ArmandHammerUK for a free oil change at pep boys #Dealmaker #Boss
9674 2018-03-29 00:48:36 Yes! I smell that and I'm immediately at the beach. (I grew up in the days of slathering on the Hawaiian Tropic tanning oil.) 
9675 2018-03-29 00:48:34 I need to get an alignment and my oil changed. 
9676 2018-03-29 00:48:00 you’re suppose to dilute it in a carrier oil not water. oil and water don’t mix so it doesn’t dilute the oil
9677 2018-03-29 00:47:51 Thank u gd ya always pretties! Kay kng sa mga buy and sell grup, permi nyu ko na mention kng may mga gapangita nga buyers.. mapa castor oil man, contact lens, facial sets, goree products and etc.. love u gurls 
9678 2018-03-29 00:47:39 @realDonaldTrump Why are you going to put Oil lines through National parks? Why do so called American's even entertain the idea of this?
9679 2018-03-29 00:47:34 Around about the mid 90's - it had a lot to do with Saudi oil and petro dollars 
9680 2018-03-29 00:47:21 Jajajaja solo boludeces habla, en el cordón industrial cerraron arzin,fábrica militar, oil y todas las pequeñas empresas que tenían sus empleados, que no eran más de 10 en algunas...y todavía falta vassalli como muchas más que van a seguir cerrando..sus puertas..
9681 2018-03-29 00:46:52 My laptop now has oil stain marks on the scroll pad because I like eat and watch everything 1 time 
9682 2018-03-29 00:46:49 Most people lose money coz they can’t control themselves. If you tradeD OIL after today’s #s, you had a nice 20 cent pop. You coulda scalped that then stopped. But if you held hoping for 65.50 then you got raped. #oott
9683 2018-03-29 00:46:43 4 tbls. flour
2 tbls. sugar
2 tbls. cocoa powder
2 tbls. water
2 tbls. oil
pinch of salt
splash of vanilla

Whisk together and make a crater in the middle, then add a spoonful of peanut butter and microwave for 50 seconds.
9684 2018-03-29 00:46:28 Doug, So what you are saying is that there are no blood diamonds and I should buy, guilt free from Conflict zones.  feminist Oil displaces Oil from regimes that oppress women. You should feel guilt for oppressing women.
9685 2018-03-29 00:46:24 Jim get the fed to lower rates.. too much disruptions out there and uncertainty .. even higher oil. doesn't mean higher Oil stock prices.. if Trump was smart. which is not. he would have waited until the summer time.. to negotiate trade when nobody even cares
9686 2018-03-29 00:46:23 Apparently, “Give it up for the big oil companies!” is not the way to get a crowd going.

9700 2018-03-29 00:43:34 Do you really think wars against oil countries are anything but for the gain of oil reserves for our country?

9703 2018-03-29 00:43:17 Oh no I've never even heard of such a thing how horrid. So no meds what does one do for it then? Maybe time to go alternative and get some oregano oil I know someone who swears by it.

9705 2018-03-29 00:43:05 Sinful. Shameful. But no surprise..no oil in PR.
9706 2018-03-29 00:43:00 Much of it is a fence, and it's costing us & our military. While corrupt Mex gov rolls in their tourist, cartel, oil & trade money, we foot the bill - & their ppl suffer. Nothin like payin 4 1st class ticket, bein put n cargo & takin long route home!

9708 2018-03-29 00:42:07 I would not recommend waiting for them to come off go pay someone to remove them they use some sort of oil
9709 2018-03-29 00:42:02 I smell amazing right now. Marzipan/vanilla lotion, rose body wash, sandalwood bath oil, amber/black currant deodorant, and my conditioner that just smells deliciously vanilla-y and floral.
9710 2018-03-29 00:41:58 Hmm I’ll be damned 12000km between oil changes
9711 2018-03-29 00:41:50 Do u not thinking that @narendramodi ji should take some actions like returning of Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi, Chowksi, Dawood to India & shelling Pak with reduction of oil prises on domestic front will help in 2019.. as these matters r emotionally linked with Indian masses!!!

9718 2018-03-29 00:41:14 Believe the construction and fortification of artificial islands to be allowed in territorial waters only. Can a nation claim a 200 mile limit on an oil island? Of course not.
Will we fight over what is left until nothing remains? Or try to make Earth more productive for all.

9723 2018-03-29 00:40:26 It's criminal what Pruitt has done at the EPA and appalling that as a big oil man, he was ever put in charge of the agency that is supposed to protect the environment against polluters, not encourage and protect them. #BootPruitt #DumpTrump #Resist

9727 2018-03-29 00:39:48 Peppermint oil (pure essential kind) mixed with Jamaican black castor oil. It’s great for hair growth. Peppermint stimulates and JBCO thickens. Best of luck.

9731 2018-03-29 00:39:04 I need some oil got so much shit on my mind
9732 2018-03-29 00:38:28 Pick the cheapest one you can get locally, that's what I did for most. In fact, my oil cleanser isn't even on those lists; it's just one I already had that turned out to be oil based.

9737 2018-03-29 00:37:55 He can’t even change the oil on a lawnmower, much less change the world.
9738 2018-03-29 00:37:29 Coconut oil is great for that too
9739 2018-03-29 00:37:12 I ALWAYS use flour and dip in egg first. 

Soy sauce, ketchup, white vinegar, Apple cider vinegar, garlic salt, sugar.

Pan fry chicken, dip in corn starch and then egg, drop into hot oil. 

Put chicken in a oven safe pan, and pour sauce over top. Bake @ 325 stir every 15min 4x

9747 2018-03-29 00:36:04 You only need one! One oil based cleanser! Of any of the types listed!
9748 2018-03-29 00:35:52 I think that’s to catch the oil when it throws a leg outa bed! 
9749 2018-03-29 00:35:15 so my BRAND NEW phone is fucked up and diesel just decided to carefully pull the brand new oil filter for my truck out of the box so he could destroy the cardboard box it come in. life’s great.

9760 2018-03-29 00:33:45 Until the United States stops being a consumer of cheap goods and starts manufacturing its own goods all this talk is just talk. The seller holds all the cards like when we were doing the selling. Now we dance when we we're told to by big oil, big pharma and the Chinese.
9761 2018-03-29 00:33:45 Does eucalyptus grow where you are? We have 3 dogs, 3 cats, no fleas ever. Two Eucalyptus trees. I know a tree is long-term but maybe you could spray eucalyptus oil around your perimeter for starters. Your property's perimeter, I mean.
9762 2018-03-29 00:32:38 The money trail of revenue/expense and charge-backs from HO in Texas clearly suggest oil profits from Canada are heading south to the US. Norway earns a huge amount of the profit % from big oil and has $Billions. Norway enjoys one of the world's largest sovereign wealth funds.
9763 2018-03-29 00:32:34 i just heard about essence today it sounds fun but expensive. i just use tea tree oil on my zits, it somehow breaks me out when i try to moisturize with it idk what quantum science is involved there
9764 2018-03-29 00:32:34 It’s easy to make ur hair less dry they have natural oils that help ! Like coconut oil for one but you can’t really stop greasy hair 
9765 2018-03-29 00:32:31 Still it’s really potent even with a few drops! Try diluting it with which hazel or using tea tree oil essence :)
9766 2018-03-29 00:32:23 What is this apology sambar chutney ... if it was done by BJP, you would have been undergone into a serious situation like that of WB DCP... you better go for oil massage and let @BJP4Karnataka handle this press communication as well

9768 2018-03-29 00:31:30 Guess we’ll just have to sacrifice Canada to US ecoterorists. US refines and exports our oil to send to the ever increasing consumption of Asia and India who by the way have 1500 coal fired power plants in various stages of construction or planning

9783 2018-03-29 00:29:51 (Guess: Oil rig in the background? Possibly an island in the distant mist. One of the Channel Islands? Seagull too close inland for Santa Barbara. Carpinteria perhaps. With two percent's worth of probability.)

9787 2018-03-29 00:29:00 At what cost? Fewer teachers? No funerals for welfare recipients? as long as they support their oil friends who cares?
9788 2018-03-29 00:28:55 If you use tea tree oil without diluting it, it’ll dry out your skin and actually make it worse. People should actually not use straight up tea tree oil because it can cause irritation as well
9789 2018-03-29 00:28:55 i use it but like i don't know what it does in general. like mine says it controls oil but....... how

9816 2018-03-29 00:24:07 CBD oil or something including THC? We are trying CBD oil on Whitney now. Not sure yet if it's doing anything. Hard to tell because he can't communicate.
9817 2018-03-29 00:23:48 Africa has the richest mineral resources in the world, a wealth of oil, the most uncultivated fertile land in the world. In fact enough fertile land to feed the rest if the world. And it remains poor. In South Africa we import t-shirts lighters, locks, etc. What we lack is brains

9823 2018-03-29 00:22:27 And boyfriends  I don’t even put oil in my own car anymore between the two
9824 2018-03-29 00:22:25 Interesting. They have already concluded they need to reduce their dependence on oil revenues and diversify. Part of the Prince's programme to modernise the country. Would leave Russia stranded as it tries to prop up price of oil by curbing production. Already said it wont work.

9829 2018-03-29 00:21:24 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
9830 2018-03-29 00:21:15 Wait, gas to peak by 2020 too for RCP2.6? Or is the blue oil? I bet the gas error bars are ugly - especially if you consider fugitive leaks and GWP range of methane.
9831 2018-03-29 00:20:58 I’m 80% sure I’ll feel better after I shower bc right now I’m a filthy mess and I can literally feel the dirt and oil in my pores
9832 2018-03-29 00:20:40 not your average joe’s bread and oil is my savior
9833 2018-03-29 00:20:36 Actually sometimes you need a moisturizer if your skin is oily, your skin is producing the extra oil because the lack of moisture!

9837 2018-03-29 00:19:46 Sometimes faces produce more oil because they’re dehydrated! Always use moisturizer, even just a light one, after washing your face. Your skin will thank you.
9838 2018-03-29 00:19:35 Good! I have a huge pile of OJ's nachos and    as many brews as I can drown myself in riding on you finishing ahead of the Oil! Dontblowit!
9839 2018-03-29 00:19:06 YUS I FEEL THIS!!! recently tho, someone taught me that when u wash ur face, you’re completely stripping the skin- so if u put GOOD oils in, then ur skin stops producing all that bad oil. i tried it myself (rose hip oil and aloe) &my face IS NOT greasy anymore! hope this helps!

Also me: I need to make those salted butter shortbread cookies.
9848 2018-03-29 00:18:26 Yup, I really hope we can open it up for some mineral extraction and hopefully oil/gas drilling too...you know, to make us some money for the parks.

9852 2018-03-29 00:17:49 literally one neutrogena deep cleanser like once a week and then peroxide/tea tree oil to spot treat my skin is pretty humble
9853 2018-03-29 00:17:43 But you want to explore for oil like the big boys right? That's what it takes. Because it's not just the building.,the acquisition of state of the art facilities, computers and software cost a lot.
9854 2018-03-29 00:17:14 It's the lobbies. They do everything to please the lobbies and keep their donations coming in. NRA, AIPAC, sugar, oil, Monsanto....
9855 2018-03-29 00:17:13 Gonna really suck when the world finally moves beyond oil.
9856 2018-03-29 00:17:02 Undoubtedly make them pay to clean it, oil is a paiiin to clean. And get it on record depending on how much oil you lost it could have done damage to your motor.. exactly why i don’t trust mechanics that i don’t know personally.

9859 2018-03-29 00:16:29 I'm so bizarrely fascinated by the concept of oil pulling-- is there any validity to it?? who can genuinely keep a mouthful of oil for as long as you're supposed to?? what does it actually achieve???
9860 2018-03-29 00:16:27 I've always wondered how the whole crew got from the rig (right when they struck oil mind you) to their homes so quickly all over the country making the FBI track them down
9861 2018-03-29 00:16:22 Lessons for SREs from Oil Refineries by @EmilStolarsky #SREcon
9862 2018-03-29 00:16:20 just to shower & oil down for bed 
9863 2018-03-29 00:16:03 Institutions are about 13x heavier on the long side than the short side of $oil

Doesn't seem healthy to me
9864 2018-03-29 00:15:37 Also they're not just another oil company. They're the state company of a poor country
9865 2018-03-29 00:15:35 Live from track 2 of #SREcon: @EmilStolarsky tells us how to not go boom: lessons from oil refineries.
9866 2018-03-29 00:15:19 I use just a little bit of castor oil every tome I shower! It works for all hair growth. I use it on my lashes and used it when I waxed half of my eyebrow off  works wonders
9867 2018-03-29 00:15:16 Lol I’m a manager at a strip club, they’re not allowed to put on any lotion or oil before going on stage. That shit is slippery, it gets the stage and pole dirty AF. So it’s not strippers doing this 
9868 2018-03-29 00:15:07 I am in desperate need of an OIL CHANGE
9869 2018-03-29 00:14:59 I need beard Oil..
9870 2018-03-29 00:14:31 Still Psalm 23

"Though' I walk through the valley of the Shadow of Death I shall fear no evil, for you are my God. Your rod and your staff they comfort me. You prepare a table before me, in the prescence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil".
9871 2018-03-29 00:14:29 Jadah has me in here drinking oil with her. She’s going to get drunk, leave and go to Man’s, while I sit here and be in my feelings Lmaoo.
9872 2018-03-29 00:13:50 What would this world be without olive oil
9873 2018-03-29 00:13:47 Not to worry. We won't have any parks or monuments left. They will all be oil rigs, and fracking and mining equip. No more parks.
9874 2018-03-29 00:13:46 I’m still laughing at that grapeseed oil guy and the one who’s cooked like 40 million chickens.
9875 2018-03-29 00:13:36 i like the Lucas Oil one too . something similar would fit its surroundings  .
9876 2018-03-29 00:13:22 More like dirt water mixed with an oil slick, so close enough i guess
9877 2018-03-29 00:13:05 It is fact that if we/world use most of the oil remaining underground the Earth's atmosphere would be too hot to support most life including humans.
9878 2018-03-29 00:13:05 If it’s raining outside, cover yourself in oil. Since water and oil don’t mix, you will stay dry.

9886 2018-03-29 00:11:20 Gotta do this oil change ASAP lol
9887 2018-03-29 00:11:20 "E-Exa! Huhuhuhuhu!!!" he wheezed out, wiping his eyes as oil filled them from laughing too much "Fuckin hell, huhu"
9888 2018-03-29 00:11:15 Shoot; we tried to incorporate Canada into the U.S. Then...umm...we could drill for oil in the Artic with nobody around to complain.

9896 2018-03-29 00:10:11 Fey urges everyone to call elected officials. "The squeaky wheel gets the oil"
9897 2018-03-29 00:10:07 I don't know where the $40m for office came from but I can assure you budgeted amounts for their new office is way less.. Then again it's not out of the ordinary that an oil company spends tens of millions of dollars on its main office.
9898 2018-03-29 00:10:00 For this to work all countries need to work together to significantly reduce oil use. Just because we have a smaller population than China doesn't mean we don't contribute; population of all countries in the world are smaller than China except maybe India.
9899 2018-03-29 00:09:44 @mauriciomacri Sr.Presidente si cierra OIL San Lorenzo además de quedar 500 personas sin trabajo esto va a ser un desastre ecológico sino se toman medidas de mantenimiento. Por favor escuchenos.
9900 2018-03-29 00:09:08 Honestly, I’ve been using my oil diffuser/ dehumidifier and putting tea tree oil in it while I sleep to help my nose. (Also a little peppermint oil will help if you’re stuffy)
9901 2018-03-29 00:09:02 But the middle east only accounts for 17% of our oil dependency...we would be hurting American jobs mostly
9902 2018-03-29 00:08:47 I’m definitely buying @rihanna BodyLava; she and @KaylarWill with her body oil about to have me with a permanent glow baby!
9903 2018-03-29 00:08:41 The kitchen blinds (came with the apartment) are the worst because they are near the stove and have vaporized oil etc on them. What’s the best thing to soak them in?
9904 2018-03-29 00:08:38 Super nice but if I really do cop I would definitely budget money for oil changes and fixes. With those cars though you don’t have to get oil changes as frequently with other cars. I heard like every 5,000 miles
9905 2018-03-29 00:08:38 Have to put on deodorant before putting coconut oil in the beard or el5e you can’t get the deodorant open
9906 2018-03-29 00:08:34 The least informed, easiest swayed by a snake oil con?  So maybe Joey tho he wouldnt stand for the nasty things trump says in rallies,
9907 2018-03-29 00:08:34 If someone could just bring me some mint oil and piping hot tea..
9908 2018-03-29 00:08:33 No, they are a vegetable. a delicious oil soaked hot vegetable
9909 2018-03-29 00:08:16 I make something similar only no feta and no sugar. You can put any veggies in it, and I just use olive oil and the juice of a Lemmon with sea salt for dressing. It’s made with Italian parsley and so yummy!
9910 2018-03-29 00:08:11 @RealRickRule @MarinKatusa Pretty soon, the market will be giving Africa Oil shares away for free.  This is great!
9911 2018-03-29 00:07:46 What, like "What if we were to drill for oil wherever we want and then sell it to people until it runs out and we destroy entire species, communities and rainforests just so we can make ourselves rich?"?
9912 2018-03-29 00:07:38 One new pipeline (the one for jet fuel) OK in BC but not the other (with oil from Alberta) although it is on an existing route with an existing pipeline ? Hypocrisy ! #bcpoli #abpoli

9918 2018-03-29 00:06:26 @JaniceMcGeachin THC Free - CBD oil which does NOT cause addiction-
Does Relieve Seizures/Pain from Chemo/Back Surgery etc., unfortunately has a "Marijuana" tag.
THIS =Only Pain Reliever that can take Place of Opioids...
I hope I didn't hear what I think I heard you say about it!
9919 2018-03-29 00:06:23 Nice work! If you really want to get close to the grill, and it's too cold, or you don't have one, use both butter and oil, on a high heat to get the crispiness on the outside of the steak. Make sure that the steak sits at least an hour out of the fridge before cooking.
9920 2018-03-29 00:06:10 Collins—ran up debt by trillions, sold worthless snake oil stock from Capital Hill, tried to influence the FDA.

McMurray—did not ghost write an opinion piece for a Supreme Court Justice yesterday.
9921 2018-03-29 00:06:06 I have been to Judsonia. Was looking for Merry War Lye for Granny to make lye soap a long time ago! Also visit Oil Trough.
9922 2018-03-29 00:06:00 I say legalize not only CBD Oil's but other forms of Medical Marijuana. Just look at the helpful results it has had in other states battling the Opioid Crisis. Not to mention the tax money our state would gain that could go to the educational system.
9923 2018-03-29 00:05:00 The value of coal/oil is severely inflated.
9924 2018-03-29 00:04:46 I don’t know how you can look at the Oil this season and note vote McDavid for the Hart.

It’s not that the Oilers are bad despite having McDavid—it’s that he’s so good despite the Oilers.
