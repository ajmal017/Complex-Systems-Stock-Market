It’s insane to assume we only use oil for fuel, or that decreasing Alberta production would drop usage! INSANELY STUPID!

9 2018-12-06 23:58:21 It would be good to investigate and inform  the real story about Venezuela. Because a north american country is chasing Venezuela's oil. No matter what it takes to get it. Remember that some country likes to sponsor civil wars in Latin America in order to enjoy their will.

11 2018-12-06 23:58:11 Our economy relies on oil.
It's a collection of hydrocarbon units arranged in chains & other simple molecular structures.
From these basic units, we produce plastics, fertilisers, solvents, paints, dyes, drugs, explosives, lubricants, liquid & gaseous fuels, & a lot more besides.
12 2018-12-06 23:57:58 apply the oils, you spritz the hair and scalp with water because oil is a sealant so if you are applying it with no moisture to seal; it defeats the whole purpose.

37 2018-12-06 23:56:26 Not widespread at all. R&D on this got put on the back burner when oil got cheap.
But will be picked up when oil gets dear again
38 2018-12-06 23:56:20 Snake oil
39 2018-12-06 23:56:19 No point in taxing consumers who are locked in. they can only buy and use what is on the market. East Tax the profits and bonuses of Oil& Gas and set a Date for vehicles to be Zero Emission Get them to focus on the fact that they are the cause of CO2 issues.
40 2018-12-06 23:55:53 The DNC overturned a rule saying they couldn’t accept money from oil and coal companies, so they’re already positioning themselves to play ball with companies destroying the planet. Also, what profiting? Bernie is one of the least rich politicians in the federal government
41 2018-12-06 23:55:36 Breadfruit fried in butter >>>> Breadfruit fried in oil
42 2018-12-06 23:55:32 Agent Qatar oil money   did it
So much for UEFA Financial Fair Play crack down
43 2018-12-06 23:55:27 You mean the maxed out oil executive donations? The association with AIPAC? The mealy-mouthed semi-commitment to progressive policy positions? His vote on the partial Dodd-Frank repeal? His membership of the "bipartisan" New Democrat caucus?
44 2018-12-06 23:55:25 Truth. But women and accountability mix like oil and water. I’m not surprised. Lol
45 2018-12-06 23:55:11 When your husband puts baby oil in your shampoo...you put hotsause in his face wash .☻ I don't get even I up your ass.
46 2018-12-06 23:55:03 @LisaLoeb here’s the apple cake recipe that I told you about:
3 cups flour, 2 cups sugar, 1 cup vegetable oil, 1/2 cup OJ, 4 eggs, 1 table spoon baking powder, 1 tablespoon vanilla, 5 Granny Smith apples sliced up. Cook 45-60 mins on 350. Enjoy!
47 2018-12-06 23:55:00 I used a new argan oil and silk protein conditioner today and my hair is feeling like a silk fucking blanket
48 2018-12-06 23:54:48 Hahahaha 10/10 didn’t mean to check the oil.
49 2018-12-06 23:54:38 amazing what lower oil prices can do huh?
50 2018-12-06 23:54:28 Wrong! Oil is the most dangerous, addictive and deadly substance of them all! How may have died for it?
51 2018-12-06 23:54:22 omgggg i got this oil from the beauty supple store and i love this smelllllll
52 2018-12-06 23:54:22 If Oil It isn't huge for Jamaica carnival imma be pissed
53 2018-12-06 23:54:14 I wish the web page gave the oil's date (year) of production. Do you know this? Always in the market for a bottle of extraordinary oil.
54 2018-12-06 23:54:14 He and Gore are snake oil salesmen!!!
55 2018-12-06 23:54:13 Yes lol talking about lemon and eucalyptus essential oil water. God weeding out the dummies
56 2018-12-06 23:54:10 noxzema deep cleansing cream, && coconut oil >>>> face regiment
57 2018-12-06 23:54:01 I’m the same way. I’m down to two meals a day the majority of the week now. One thing I did notice that when I added coconut oil into my morning regime my appetite is way down.
58 2018-12-06 23:54:00 If they do cut Mr President, we will pump ourselves, and they can sell there oil elsewhere.  Sounds like a lot more good paying American jobs!
59 2018-12-06 23:53:58 Well gee how long will we live if we do nothing? Tax the oil and gas companies instead of giving them subsidies.
60 2018-12-06 23:53:58 I love oil. Rub it to my dick.
61 2018-12-06 23:53:54 If a gas station attendant gave Beto $100 it’s considered a donation from the oil and gas industry.  Know the facts.
62 2018-12-06 23:53:51 The U.S. Just Became a Net Oil Exporter for the First Time in 75 Years. Do we still need the Department of Energy?
63 2018-12-06 23:53:43 black seed oil and vitamin c 1000mg does the trick together
64 2018-12-06 23:53:39 My car told me it needed an oil change today I'm like damn who you raising your voice at 
65 2018-12-06 23:53:38 Make oil 2 cheap then N Dak and other shale fracking zones will shut off
66 2018-12-06 23:53:27 What’s the average donation from McDonalds employees vs. oil and gas industry execs? Would love to see that data. Also curious to know whether McDonalds employees are contributing to mass extinction due to climate disaster or if they’re just poor people struggling to earn a wage.
67 2018-12-06 23:53:25 there's a number of different metrics you could use, all of which have some fudge factor.  Easiest way is to simply revalue gold (SDR's?) v. oil and maintain the ratio, then let nations figure out what they want to do re: import oil or produce their own.
68 2018-12-06 23:53:15 Or baby oil

69 2018-12-06 23:53:13 Ok first of all change up the oil, look for any already mixed oil blend with peppermint oil. Personally I would recommend Mielle Organics almond and peppermint oil will save you mixing it yourself. You need oils that are similar to your own sebum and high in vitamin E.
70 2018-12-06 23:53:10 i felt the same way at first im like wow im really just rubbing thick ass oil on my face huh
71 2018-12-06 23:52:56 No they want to see the end of the oil industry, electric cars on the roads, no smog covered cities, no murderous Saudi regimes that are being propped up with oil money, its all coming to an end, whether you like it or not.
72 2018-12-06 23:52:41 Only the snake oil salesman can give us NUCLEAR GENOCIDE!
73 2018-12-06 23:52:33 Last I heard rail cars were more dangerous than a pipeline for moving oil
74 2018-12-06 23:52:02 Now that's what I can spin?! @SNP on @bbcquestiontime claiming Scotland leading the way on climate change. "Since 1990 our carbon emissions have dropped..%" ...due to deindustrialisation, NOT a world leading green agenda. How's the "carbon neutral" North Sea oil & gas going??
75 2018-12-06 23:51:55 @MBTA_CR my car was COVERED in oil from the train tonight. Completely covered. 
Stoughton mbta station. Dm me
76 2018-12-06 23:51:46 Peak oil discussions seemed to be rife w/Kremlin influence, not just Rohrabacher <sp?>, but other figures.

Yet there's no disputing the facts. The planet is a ball. Even if it were a giant balloon filled with oil, the fossil fuels we could drill, mine &/or frac would be finite.
77 2018-12-06 23:51:31 This is a very dumb piece. The 2020 Dem primary is going to be a giant GOP style bevy of options clusterfuck. The very opposite of last cycle's cleared field. Yes Patrick dropped out, Warren shot herself in the foot, and @davidsirota highlighted Beto's oil donations. Who cares?
78 2018-12-06 23:51:30 if you are referring to the destruction of rain forests..

79 2018-12-06 23:51:28 The oil is running dry.

81 2018-12-06 23:51:22 True, the oil production cuts in Alberta by the NDP government here, did catch my attention tho

86 2018-12-06 23:50:55 There’s still time if you live locally to order a baby basket for Xmas!  Baby soaps with no parabens and with essential oils, Baby Bum Cream, Baby Oil & Calm Your Cough Blend along with some other cute goodies!
87 2018-12-06 23:50:54 Oglobal warming?
You use coconut oil?
Products with it?
Then you do not believe in global warming.
88 2018-12-06 23:50:53 The better money is in working for the oil industry. I've been looking.
89 2018-12-06 23:50:50 yes but oil is in just about everything we consume
90 2018-12-06 23:50:49 I don't do pork. But we can try with chicken! Also. Oil makes a huge mess x.x
91 2018-12-06 23:50:41 Also a oil tycoon who gained power over the US army and his son did as while launching literal war in the name of their company.

93 2018-12-06 23:50:34 Baking soda...? And a drop of peppermint oil?
94 2018-12-06 23:50:18 Add oil 
95 2018-12-06 23:50:07 This is BS. Government doesn’t do oil exploration. What private company really discovered it?
96 2018-12-06 23:50:05 Every five weeks, Chinese cities add 9500 zero-emission #electricbuses - the equivalent of London’s entire working fleet. In Australia, Adelaide was the first city to follow suit . The worldwide trend is beginning to hurt the oil industry.
97 2018-12-06 23:50:01 Why does this beard oil make me smell like I ran the chainsaw for nine hours on wood hauling day?
98 2018-12-06 23:49:59 Great job bud.
99 2018-12-06 23:49:54 A lot of what oil companies are doing is cleaning up regions, like the sands in Canada where the oil has seeped above ground, or regions in the ocean where there are oil seeps on the sea floor
Cleaning up unusable regions.
100 2018-12-06 23:49:51 Botox trending has got me worried that some scumbag is going to try injecting CBD oil into women's lips and can I just say before anyone tries it: DON'T
101 2018-12-06 23:49:50 why i always oil up
102 2018-12-06 23:49:44 So...about that peak oil
103 2018-12-06 23:49:39 Have you tried Jojoba oil? Or almond oil?
104 2018-12-06 23:49:34 Ever wanted free horse revivers, gun oil, express rifle rounds, moonshine, and more? Well then check out my next video #RedDeadOnline
105 2018-12-06 23:49:31 I’ll see your oil & gas $ and raise you: In 2005 Sanders voted for the Gun lobby’s bill of immunity from product liability lawsuits...our only industry so protected. It robbed cities of their most effective weapon against the gun epidemic. The NRA will be 2020’s Goldman Sachs.
106 2018-12-06 23:49:17 “In all, the new reserve is said to contain 281 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, 46.3 billion barrels of oil, and 20 billion barrels of natural-gas liquids, the Interior Department’s U.S. Geological Survey said.”

113 2018-12-06 23:48:54 @pachasoap Just so you are aware. If you are not specific about what essential plant extracts you are using. You cannot sell to customers with tree nut allergies. We don't know if you used nut or tree oil in the soap amd therefore, want to try it. But won't.
114 2018-12-06 23:48:46 It's okay Scotland will still sell oil water and electricity to the UK and unlike the current situation Scotland won't shaft the UK in the process
115 2018-12-06 23:48:43 Do any of you give your child fish oil?  I am trying to find one without tilapia oil, any recommendations?

121 2018-12-06 23:48:03 Apparently referencing Oil Can Harry means I'm "making stuff up" and proving he's from Might Mouse is greeted by "well I'm not from the 50s".  I am apparently.  Other folks under 40 remember this stuff right?  Right?!

127 2018-12-06 23:47:50 Cabbage soup. Sautee the onions with some oil until they’re translucent, then add the beef/bones and sautée until they start to smell really fucking good. Then add literally everything else and simmer for at least half an hour.
128 2018-12-06 23:47:44 Number one revenue in the auto industry. Done debating you all. Next step. Short big auto and big oil.
129 2018-12-06 23:47:40 problem is we are the bigggest consumer of oil by far
130 2018-12-06 23:47:39 Thats not debatable. A tax, well ... @AndrewScheer wants more pipelines and eventually will have to give our tax dollars to workers in oil because its a dying industry. So a small tax now, which you can get back if you really care, is really nothing compared to #ScheerIgnorance

133 2018-12-06 23:47:37 You and I are like oil & water
134 2018-12-06 23:47:28 I assume the USD is valued relative to the health & stability of its economy.
But an IMF issued currency would be valued relative to oil & gold.
A different the metric?
135 2018-12-06 23:47:23 I wouldn't call it beautiful when you're trying to eek out a living doing it or just hoping it pays for itself. Either way we need oil at120

139 2018-12-06 23:47:05 Damon blinked. Then a lustful grin bloomed on his lips.

"With pleasure, my Lord..."

His hands descended on Asmodeus's bulging muscles eagerly, rubbing the warm, pleasantly scented oil further into the skin. He wriggled playfully in his lap, tail coiling around his thick thigh.
140 2018-12-06 23:47:04 Why do we supply ANYTHING to Saudi Arabia for their war in Yemen when they have so much money and oil that they don’t need our help?

142 2018-12-06 23:46:33 Depends if ur looking for a quicker fix, vape is more of an instant pain relief as it’s not processed by the liver but doesntnhave the same long term effects as oil xx
143 2018-12-06 23:46:06 I wanna watch the originals but do I really feel like ruining the makeup I did for the oil change I flaked on?
144 2018-12-06 23:45:59 the fuss around Beto taking oil money is that he didn't take oil money any more than Bernie took money from the military industrial complex or Ocasio took money from Wall Street. it's a ridiculous attack on someone who receives no PAC money, and dumb people are falling for it.

147 2018-12-06 23:45:36 Got the hair salon smelling like tea tree oil and they do not like the smell of it at all  my scalp is more important the smell will go away
148 2018-12-06 23:45:24 what happens if i drink essential oil
149 2018-12-06 23:45:22 Leave it in the ground? Give it to Mexico?  Do you even know how much we need oil to live.  You can't replace it with anything right now.  Grow up!

151 2018-12-06 23:45:15 Cannabis makes a lot of different products. But we drill for oil does that mean you should sniff gasoline or even drink it?
152 2018-12-06 23:45:14 One thing you need to remember. They predict that oil will be consumed completely in the next 20 years. After that you will go back to battle relegation year in, year out
153 2018-12-06 23:45:02 I think I bought “I can’t believe it’s not butter”  damn well better not be butter. I also hate using things with palm oil. :( it’s all so sad. Also, do you know any chapstick brands without Beeswax that are good? That’s my only problem atm tbh.

161 2018-12-06 23:44:19 that does solve the problem of the end of cheap conventional oil

164 2018-12-06 23:44:09 Russia and Saudi loaned Trump a lot of money. Trump's job? Raise oil prices.
165 2018-12-06 23:44:05 Also I have thoughts about oil rubbed bronze, is that a potential thing? Because I think it’s pretty.
166 2018-12-06 23:44:04 I guess the Quebec premier doesn’t realize how many workers fly from Quebec to Alberta for employment in the oil sands.  I bet they would argue that a pipeline is in their interests.  Bombardiers bailouts weren’t in the interests of most Canadians but we didn’t get a say in that.
167 2018-12-06 23:44:03 They were conned! Through the years millions of people have been conned by snake oil salesmen. Promised them what they longed for and rode out of town in the middle of the night. I think Donald is about ready to call his carriage to the back of the WH and hightail it FLA. Please!
168 2018-12-06 23:44:00 The mega wealthy greedy crooks need to be swayed into investing into green energy sources to get them to back off pushing oil down our throats...
169 2018-12-06 23:43:59 Jillian u can do CBD-THC (oil or gel tabs)what the researchers that do research on cancer patients has said 2 me that u do about a 9-9 ratio it will help a great deal.

170 2018-12-06 23:43:59 I had a bad dream about being in a car accident and I went to my car with oil and pray the whole neighborhood down  I don’t care where this life takes me, certain things my parents taught me ain’t never leaving Lolol #PastorsKid

176 2018-12-06 23:43:24 PSA reminder for my friends who like to cook: don’t forget hot oil can splatter onto your hands, face, etc... when you add items to the pan, causing painful burns. 
177 2018-12-06 23:43:24 If the burning of fossil fuels contributes to climate change why do we keep supporting Alberta in this endeavour? Would we not be better off helping Alberta develop cleaner alternatives? Asbestos died a painful death, maybe it is time to help the oil sands do the same.
178 2018-12-06 23:43:18 How about oil prices per barrel that was a belter IMF bailout in first year yikes
179 2018-12-06 23:42:52 only downside is palm oil sadly but that goes for like every processed food lmao
180 2018-12-06 23:42:50 Yes absolutely!! As long as you use them correctly. I haven’t used a wax warmer in a while though. I love oil diffusers! I would go with that
181 2018-12-06 23:42:35 That's a very naïve statement Ross. #Scotland has little or no say in the management of the oil industry as things stand. In an independent #Scotland economically we'd need it to fund the move to totally renewable energy sources which we all agree is the goal.
182 2018-12-06 23:42:33 Lol that be u oil up hosting the party 
183 2018-12-06 23:42:26 dude!!!! i know some brands of butter are accidentally vegan, i think country crock is & so is smart balance! they base it off oil just like vegan butters but they’re in higher demand so they’re a lil cheaper :)
184 2018-12-06 23:42:25 Investigate how much RU oligarchs have invested in oil. Illegal loans just to invest more. They NEED oil to go up! Plus, RU has oil to sell.
185 2018-12-06 23:42:23 The British minister says we need to cut our carbon emissions but a large chunk of an independent Scotland's budget would come from north sea oil.

187 2018-12-06 23:41:48 you can use pam or olive oil and i think it’ll be okay
188 2018-12-06 23:41:30 This article doesn’t make clear if land is being sold or leases are being sold for oil and gas. There is a difference. An actual sale of land would be considered an adverse effect under NHPA and require Section 106 process, including tribal consultations.
189 2018-12-06 23:41:25 What is the global climate impact of Saudi Arabia's oil output?

Globally, how much investment is being made in sustainable technologies as a 100% alternative to fossil fuels?
190 2018-12-06 23:41:17 I’ve done that with a glue trap, but it’s harder than you’d expect. You take the mouse outside, trap and all, douse the whole thing in cooking oil and wait. It’s messy, but eventually the mouse works it’s way loose and runs off.
191 2018-12-06 23:40:48 Why don't politicians act on climate change? Well let's take a look. Brokenshire for example. His previous employer advised and represented numerous shale gas companies in the US and has “long-standing relationships within the oil and gas industry" #BBCQT
192 2018-12-06 23:40:42 Are other democrats running for office in oil industry states getting money from the same category of donors? People are suggesting this correlation is just a result of geography, due to the fact Texas has more of that industry. A thorough analysis would look for uneven trends.

Purdue Pharma knew OxyContin was addictive but whitewashed the results while they pushed the drugs onto doctors who then pushed it onto their patients, and it made its way into the streets.  Big Pharma, Big Ag, Big Oil, 3 greedy monsters.
197 2018-12-06 23:40:19 All good but assesment is no where near reality along with the land burn rate is much too fast to start parades.  Oil we’re pulling is also condensate grade in other countries.
198 2018-12-06 23:40:17 yes! and olive oil spray, cooking spray, etc I was thinking I might try that

When I use it like that I dont have issues, but dont use it all over unless diluted!

206 2018-12-06 23:39:50 Hmm.. anyone have oil consumption problems with their KIA? If Kia changes your oil, make sure they measure how much oil burned each time. Mine's been burning a quart of oil every 3000 miles. Did Kia say anything to me when I was getting my oil changed each time? No they didn't.
207 2018-12-06 23:39:46 Come on! RU want oil prices to go up. This is his main purpose. Expect them to go up before he's ousted. Guaranteed.
208 2018-12-06 23:39:42 Do you have some vegetable or olive oil?
209 2018-12-06 23:39:39 I’ve had 48 hours, the oil and vinegar have settled #woopig
210 2018-12-06 23:39:38 That'll be oil staying where it is then?
211 2018-12-06 23:39:38 Forget the cake hype. What is the state of Jamaica’s public sector/management of resources. The NWC boss told us a few weeks ago that only 30% of water is paid for and Petrojam lost 5.2 billion dollars based on the missing oil. I am not knocking politicians just  stating 1/2
212 2018-12-06 23:39:37 Let's see @IanBlackfordMP  lead the campaign to stop oil production in the North Sea to stop global warming #bbcqt

217 2018-12-06 23:38:51 Alberta govt going to be spending $84K in Montreal to promote getting oil to tidewater. The release says the NDP are taking an "unprecedented step of buying advertising in three newspapers, buying significant space on three websites and using the sides of buildings".
218 2018-12-06 23:38:38 Similar stuff here in TX. Denton TX voted to ban fracking several years ago, and the TX legislature promptly passed a bill forbidding all cities from banning oil and gas exploration. Guess where the GOP gets most of its money?
219 2018-12-06 23:38:31 Did he talk about how Hitler razed the temple and then Jesus found enough oil to light the statue of liberty and then he was elected president and moved the Western wall to Jerusalem and now everyone should thank him?

243 2018-12-06 23:36:51 When we going to make the link between the petrojam scandal and Venezuela? We don't produce oil so one wonders
244 2018-12-06 23:36:49 Canada is producing Bitumin at the behest of Davos and the EU.  The World Bank and IMF are investing in FF projects around the world.  German, French and Swiss industry said they will not give up using Palm Oil.

246 2018-12-06 23:36:44 @PnPCBC I had to laugh, today, in @VassyKapelos interview with Kenney, as he tried to make it sound like Notley worked with him to put a cap on Alberta oil production. Not only does he think he's already won the next election. He thinks he won the previous one, too! #pnpcbc
247 2018-12-06 23:36:44 Corn follows oil. Absolutely!
248 2018-12-06 23:36:43 I imagine Charles Moore spends weekends chucking oil down the drain and wantonly setting plastics on fire just to own ‘science’ and, I dunno, China
249 2018-12-06 23:36:41 There is a green energy that is the most rebust energy source which is hydrogen power but no main party will fully support it as it takes us out of the pockets of the oil rich countries that financially helps us out
250 2018-12-06 23:36:37 Really sad and tragic that much of the world still runs with the hare and hunt with the hounds! I am sure oil is a major factor but it speaks more of the body called UN! Keep on the good fight, Israel!
251 2018-12-06 23:36:32 When's the best time to start using beard oil guys?
252 2018-12-06 23:36:30 “Exhibit A” what does that mean? What Sirota reported is simply fact. Obama promised to expand oil drilling and I still voted for him twice; I’d rather know than not know, who the contributors are

254 2018-12-06 23:36:29 But after that, and before the Christmas rush, prices may climb again. The promise of a trade deal with China may boost confidence in the economy, he said, pushing global oil demand back up and driving prices higher.
255 2018-12-06 23:36:28 Go to the auto shop, they said. It'll be fun, they said. Get a simple oil change and alignment, they said. 

I've been told that pretty much my car needs everything serviced/fixed including a battery I had put in around 1 year ago. Ugh...
256 2018-12-06 23:36:28 We got where we are today b/c of f.fuels, burn more oil, stop deforestation, plant more trees!
257 2018-12-06 23:36:26 Was a solid quarter and raise. Hard to square the upbeat commentary with the drop in oil prices, but the conference call was nothing but positive.
258 2018-12-06 23:36:12 The major oil producer I used to work for has been loosing on average 1B net a quarter, wrap your head around those number for when they make profit again. In the highest of the peak they were making 200-300M a quarter of net profit, big difference with the massive looses
259 2018-12-06 23:36:10 History shows that if oil is cheap so is grain. You want 5 dollar corn and 13 dollar beans again it will cost us 4 dollar gas. Just saying
260 2018-12-06 23:36:09 Mental health is a serious issue and justifying your emotions with Astrology (snake oil) vs. actually seeking help/treatment (science) only hurts yourself and those around you
261 2018-12-06 23:36:05 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
262 2018-12-06 23:35:56 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.
263 2018-12-06 23:35:42 Most companies are nowhere near producing at their alleged “capacity” right now though. Heading into October there was only 101,000 KG of dried bud and 48,000 liters of oil in the entire sector....this “oversupply” based on capacity is a long ways away.
264 2018-12-06 23:35:22 No, it will not. Canadian + OPEC + Russian production cuts will send oil back to $60, at which point it becomes a very compelling short.

266 2018-12-06 23:35:15 The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will meet Thursday in Vienna to discuss a reduction in crude oil production. That reduction could make gas prices go up in the future
The only other thing that could keep prices low is if domestic crude oil inventory is up

269 2018-12-06 23:34:47 This poll is rigged by the democratic Russians of soviet big oil Mexico
270 2018-12-06 23:34:44 This isn't corporate profits it's dividends. A lot of companies will decide to keep dividends high during though time to limit the drop of the share price. This is not to be confused with net profit. If you look at most upstream oil companies they are having very heavy loses.

272 2018-12-06 23:34:28 means they ain’t change the oil they friend it in 
273 2018-12-06 23:34:23 Niggas who don’t know how to change a tire/oil be the ones who be asking for the most
274 2018-12-06 23:34:00 It’s reverse psychology. Oil&gas is in a good position. Halved production costs & sensible wages. Never mind sanctions on Iran probably going to raise prices beyond $100 a barrel.
It can fund our renewables even further but they’re just scared it’s no longer an anti-Indy argument
275 2018-12-06 23:33:47 Politicians aren't doing enough on climate change because the world's economy is dependent on oil. We're going to need global financial reform, which won't happen. #bbcqt

279 2018-12-06 23:33:24 When these useless @prakashraaj speaks that Modi is NRI...two important news 1. Saudi minister informs us that PM Modi requested to keep oil prices low. 2. Corrupt Mama of congress in India custody....WHAT THIS GUY HAS ANYTHING USEFUL FOR THIS COUNTRY TO QUESTION PM?
280 2018-12-06 23:33:14 Perfectly comfortable with huge freight ships continuing to run on diesel, & planes on Av Gas, if we didn't have to use any coal, gas or oil on land. The tech is already invented for wide scale domestic energy & we need to push it immediately to avoid disaster.
281 2018-12-06 23:33:13 Ginoo ko. Chicken oil dili chicken sweat POKUS
282 2018-12-06 23:33:13 Essential oils CAN be used on skin HOWEVER they need a CARRIER oil for THIS reason.
283 2018-12-06 23:33:05 Typical oil baron!!
284 2018-12-06 23:32:32 The US fought the war as part of its strategy to control ME oil. Some have mistakenly confused that with access to oil. Controlling ME oil,  'veto power ' as Kissinger called it, has been a guiding principle of US foreign policy since NSC68.
285 2018-12-06 23:32:32 Yes it's fair as he voted against a bill that would have regulated oil drilling and is pro-fracking. He's also pro-AIPAC which makes him human scum
286 2018-12-06 23:32:26 Gas prices are down because oil is up . enjoy it while it last
287 2018-12-06 23:32:22 I understand that Beto like Obama is charismatic, but what I want is a candidate that fights for #Medicare4All #ClimateAction and is not beholden to AIPAC or corporate interests of oil & gas. Can a Texan deliver? The young are not stupid, it is their future that is at stake.

289 2018-12-06 23:32:19 All star！！Add oil LPL！@lplenglish
290 2018-12-06 23:32:14 dont look at me sideways ma’am it looks like i could cook an egg on your head with all that oil you got in ya hair
291 2018-12-06 23:32:01 The history of huge infrastructure achievements in NE Scotland is very short, but I can safely say most of them have occurred in the last 10 years.
Throughout the oil boom, you built thousands of houses without appropriate infrastructure.  The SNP are cleaning up your mess.
292 2018-12-06 23:31:57 Let me put it this way... The Saudi dictatorship wouldn't last more than a year or two if the US did not support it militarily. Neither Russia nor China are yet in a position to take that role.
The second thing is that oil is becoming obsolete.
293 2018-12-06 23:31:52 Genius woman.... there really is no "both sides" of the science. The only scientists who don't agree are paid by coal and oil companies NOT to agree. That's a payoff, not science sweetie.
294 2018-12-06 23:31:42 Started out gettin a oil change for my car, then I needed new break pads and rotors, then I needed new wheel bearings and now my headlights are broke. Love it
295 2018-12-06 23:31:40 There’s this older man here waiting for an oil change and he’s so so precious . He has a little flip phone just talking to his daughter .
296 2018-12-06 23:31:38 It's not an issue of benefit of the doubt. I read his climate change plans and sure he doesn't call for the immediate end to all carbon emissions....but no one else does either. Otherwise his plan is consistent with what Democrats advocate whether they get oil $ or not
297 2018-12-06 23:31:12 @dpradhanbjp ,Sir I am at indian oil petrolpump Semara-bhagora,Sajjanata, Gorakhpur.The petrol pump worker refusing to give the petrol.

300 2018-12-06 23:30:45 自分もoilが1番好きですね。出だしのピアノとかぐぐっときます。大晦日まで後20日余り順位の変動があるか私事ながら楽しみであります。
301 2018-12-06 23:30:44 Exactly. Why wld they continue to invest in Volt when Trump pushes oil & coal, & throws out emissions standards. Right?
302 2018-12-06 23:30:42  ikon Allah was that a sign
303 2018-12-06 23:30:40 Preheat a skillet medium heat with olive oil and thyme them place the steak for 2-3 minutes each side. Let it rest for 5 minutes before you enjoy it
304 2018-12-06 23:30:39 THE OIL WELLS WERE DEPRESSURIZED by Chavez who let the associated gas out after the strike. The investment required to repressurize them is enormous. Will Russia invest that? In exchange for what?!
305 2018-12-06 23:30:34 I need @j_aryelle to come oil my scalp lol
306 2018-12-06 23:30:34 What the world dosnt need is GLOBAL POLLUTION.

OVERCHARGE OIL: OK
OVERCHARGE GAS: OK
307 2018-12-06 23:30:33 You want clean and to cut pollution! You? Are you taking the mick? Is that why you reneged on Americas pollution cutting pledges and the Kyoto accord? Why made your crony the head of the EPA so could build your oil pipeline? Didn't you say something about draining a swamp?

We’re talkin sunscreen, lube, in our hair, on our face, you name it
Wherever Lani was, there was coconut oil
310 2018-12-06 23:30:27 Yes, all part of the green initiative. I've done my bit, ditched the oil boiler, fitted a wood pellet burner, changed all the light bulb's to LED, won't ditch my diesel car yet though.
311 2018-12-06 23:30:25 Well 1700 cal of steak and olive oil will not allow for weight loss.
312 2018-12-06 23:30:10 The great miracle that happened there is the miracle of Chanukah, and it applies to us today. Even when the oil runs low, God keeps the oil burning. He is not limited by a limited supply or overwhelmed by overwhelming odds. Remember, “Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit.”

317 2018-12-06 23:29:25 1 daily task. Get oil change.

Did that. Day drink ever since.
318 2018-12-06 23:29:22 This is an image of a dockyard not oil derricks lol
319 2018-12-06 23:29:21 It moisturizes and for me it helps balance out my natural oil production! I get pretty oily in my tzone and so I was using tons of like “anti-oil” stuff but that just sent my skin into overdrive and made it produce more oil to compensate so this is gentler.

321 2018-12-06 23:28:44 @AJA_Cortes Alex, do you use oil to “cook” your steaks? Yes or no? If so, do you use Avocado oil?
322 2018-12-06 23:28:41 Do u hv d access
323 2018-12-06 23:28:32 I believe in hybrid cars and clean water. But we don’t need to waste the electric when we can make a hybrid oil sludge and coal powered car! Made in USA! #coal @elonmusk @senatemajldr #mcrib
324 2018-12-06 23:28:25 But... seho and vanilla dont go together, like water and oil... but seho and dirty tho get along like fire and straws
325 2018-12-06 23:28:19 Voiding the Endangered Species Act , trump is giving the Fossil Fuel Industry free reign to bulldoze  , pipeline  , oil platform  , Dirty Coal Mines and eliminate many species through habitat loss  , as will his  ' Wall ' . His pocketbook matters more to him
326 2018-12-06 23:28:09 Missing oil in Jamaica? You check montague obeah uncle?
327 2018-12-06 23:28:07 She’s married to some rich oil company fuck!
328 2018-12-06 23:27:57 You’re right almost, we shouldn’t need oil at all! We should be a leading and rich nation utilizing the greatest technology and clean fuel processes, benefitting from basically free sun, wind, and oceanic power sources. Oil should have died long ago if not for big money/greed!
329 2018-12-06 23:27:47 got home, took some cbd oil, having a drink and im having chicken for dinner. WINNING
330 2018-12-06 23:27:39 Walking under the bridge of waste. I met my maker, my taker of my soul. He showed me my past and future but the present was too blurry to open. Then he took my hand, with his oil coloured claws and showed me the door to my sanity but when I tried to open it, I woke up sobbing.
331 2018-12-06 23:27:33 I think the whitest thing I've ever done is go to an Olive Oil tasting
332 2018-12-06 23:27:24 Found my growth oil
333 2018-12-06 23:27:17 Citronella oil....
334 2018-12-06 23:26:53 あざます！！( ^ω^ )
335 2018-12-06 23:26:52 My oil needs changed, my tire went flat and my passenger light went out. 
Tonight just won’t stop will it?
336 2018-12-06 23:26:45 Imagine the future 
Be inside the past
Lift the illusion
Over the March
I am so in love
It's breaking me up
As I have nothing at the souls of my feet
Tripped over intention
Allowed to speak
Into the oil bath 
To good to keep
Smash the galley
Cover the weeks
Able or not #BardBits
337 2018-12-06 23:26:42 No my point is weresre no where close to not needing oil
338 2018-12-06 23:26:29 We're down to the last roll of the dice to allow future generations the same opportunities we had & we're still blinded by short-term greed. Oil isn't a future. 
#pnpcbc
339 2018-12-06 23:26:28 Maybe we should use aviation oil
340 2018-12-06 23:26:05 If it’s IMF.  Could also use gold, either for good or until IMF gets SDR stuff ready.  Or IMF could price gold and oil in SDRs and maintain a ratio between the 2 different than the current and achieve similar outcome
341 2018-12-06 23:25:55 AGAIN, we are speaking of two completely different processes for making carbon black.  In the table you refer to, both processes are listed (i.e., the Oil furnace process on the 1st line & the "Thermal process" on the last line).
342 2018-12-06 23:25:54 Just got my dumb ass oil changed 
343 2018-12-06 23:25:45 Ps 141:5 - Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness:
and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil,

346 2018-12-06 23:25:33 would be curious to know how much oil 1KG of cannabis can produce, I think oil will be a larger market
347 2018-12-06 23:25:31 Yes let's destroy the Earth and kill everything for oil
When alternatives exist but not enough money for research 
How about electric everything while waiting for solar batteries to improve
348 2018-12-06 23:25:18 Trump's tax promise of trillions back to US fails to materialize - OMG! You guys crack me up. Are you really surprised? Tax trillions go only to trump-types, including agency heads recruited from Pharma, Oil & Gas and major banks. I hear a recession brewing - thanks republicans!

353 2018-12-06 23:24:36 Yeah that’s almost $7/gallon. It’s CRAZYTOWN!!!!  Milk comes from a tit.. oil comes from middle of earth and is refined to make gas, it’s $2/gallon 
354 2018-12-06 23:24:30 Sobrang tipid ko na sa makeup these days.  ang lala ng foundation effect at oil control ng hormones. Tuyot kung tuyot sis???
355 2018-12-06 23:24:30 The best thing we can do as a country is get rid of that embarrassment of a leader who loves clean coal and oil companies.
356 2018-12-06 23:24:19 Where can I buy vetiver essential oil?
357 2018-12-06 23:24:14 even the so-called 'sustainable' palm oil too...

Don't be led astray by vegetable oil either...
358 2018-12-06 23:24:07 Right... which is why we received the least number of power plays last year... makes sense
359 2018-12-06 23:24:03 Belle Glade is a high violent crime agricultural city near Lake Okeechobee with a population of 20,000. It is 14% white (and dropping fast), 50% black, and 30% hispanic. It has a black mayor. Arab oil money will easily buy into this city and establish a strong islamic redoubt.
360 2018-12-06 23:23:58 OPEC stalling output adjustment, will keep the oil low and tame the dollar. Benefit Indonesia balance of payment for import. CAD.
361 2018-12-06 23:23:52 Coconut Oil replaced the dog as mans best friend!
362 2018-12-06 23:23:41 ... but out of spite, everything that dies turn into coal and oil over the years: a trap, once life returns, allowing it to kill itself again.
363 2018-12-06 23:23:26 Yup betul. Kalau gune in long term nnt akan perasan pores mcm tak clogged dah and jadi less visible.

369 2018-12-06 23:23:06 Seeing oil prices drop gives me such anxiety... 
370 2018-12-06 23:23:05 They're okay with OPEC oil though despite no concerns for environmental issues. The Star's lining up for that Liberal media bribe money.
371 2018-12-06 23:23:03 How Funny The USGS Thinks they Found it,  The US Oil & Gas Industry Found it. USGS are the C & D Students Who Couldn’t Find Employment in Private Sector !   
372 2018-12-06 23:23:03 I have fair/sensitive skin which can be prone to dryness, especially in winter, but I still battle shine/oil and preventing breakouts. I have found that Celestial is rich enough that my skin really soaks it up, but it doesn’t make my skin increase oil/sebum or clog up my pores.
373 2018-12-06 23:22:49 You’re a hater! We have The Greatest Economy Ever! Blacks, Hispanics and Women have the lowest unemployment ever! Low Gas Prices America is #1 in Gas and Oil thanks to Trump. He donates his salary! Read about McCain’s & The Forrestal! You have him on a perch to high! Stop hating
374 2018-12-06 23:22:44 Willful ignorance from BS aligned critics if Beto. He took no PAC $.  individuals working in oil/gas industries giving to his campaign against Cruz is a good thing IMHO.
375 2018-12-06 23:22:25 We replace them here and then it doesn't rain for six months.  LOL  I mostly use mine to clean the dust off the windshield and sometimes run out of washer fluid before my next oil change.

380 2018-12-06 23:21:23 It looks a very good stock to me.  I prefer RRE at the moment purely based on Jurisdiction in the UK North Sea and the 50/50 Oil Gas split.  Also funds are a little stretched, but there is a good chance I will turn my attention here if funds elsewhere become available.
381 2018-12-06 23:21:15 Do you think the whole "#2 recipient of oil & gas industry donations" fiasco was fair criticism? Im honestly wondering. I'm not a Beto fan boy and I think his voting record needs to be seriously discussed but that struck me as a bad faith attack.
382 2018-12-06 23:21:14 Don’t worry. You’re oil rich so the western world will literally let you get away with murder. Why not buy a couple of football teams to ingratiate yourselves further?

388 2018-12-06 23:20:36 @NatalCicuto I don't disagree with your premise but I'll ask, what are you and your family doing to get off the oil? What about your food, travel etc. I have installed solar, take public trans as much as possible and know that transition will take a while ~50 yrs
389 2018-12-06 23:20:04 I know how to actually make them, Amanda and I just found it easier to bake them, rather than buying a shit ton of oil to deep fry them in and having to clean everything up haha

394 2018-12-06 23:19:39 These things are correlated, but not at 100%. NW Europeans stand out from other peoples of the first world by other factors than IQ. The third is a trick one. Oil can be a curse for the stability of your institutions and the Dutch disease can hurt your industry.
395 2018-12-06 23:19:36 Camps are nothing new in the oil patch
396 2018-12-06 23:19:28 Being that the lanes would dry up fairly quickly, and with the possibility of no way to lay down fresh oil, I'll take an 900 Global After Dark Pearl. A 900 Global Desert Ops may have been another good choice, but with the color, I might lose it in the sand. :D
397 2018-12-06 23:19:21 This is the phrasing out if the oil sands you were talking about?

402 2018-12-06 23:18:50 oh I guess I misread your earlier tweet. The reason why is because he raised so much money, from what I can tell. I don't really mind him taking individual donations from working people who work in oil
403 2018-12-06 23:18:47 I made a special trip to Iceland last week to buy some. I won't buy any other mince pies this Christmas and I thank you for your stance against Palm Oil. They are delicious too! #nopalmoilchristmas

406 2018-12-06 23:18:17 Then I can only assume you're a corporate shill for Big Oil.

Wow, way to kick your country in the ass while it's in a recession. 

What side deal did you do selling oil to the US?
411 2018-12-06 23:17:38 How much oil does Tesla need to make and ship those products ?
412 2018-12-06 23:17:34 Ajuste the headline: united by oil, CRIME and isolation.
Much better!
413 2018-12-06 23:17:23 Point in fact, have you seen that bit of oil that floats to the top of Coca Cola?  I rest my case!

415 2018-12-06 23:17:10 You can ingest small amounts of peppermint oil but it can give you a few side effects like heartburn and tummy ache, instead of having it in capsules try a few drops in coffee or herbal tea! Also do a bit of research just in case it’s not for you hun xx
416 2018-12-06 23:16:53 Barbara gave me some shampoo brand called monat, more like shampoop! My hair felt like straw and so much fell out. I'll be sticking to my essential oil shampoo
417 2018-12-06 23:16:51 Too funny and agree the cell service is THE WORST at Lucas Oil Stadium.
418 2018-12-06 23:16:50 Wat is really wrong with Nigerians and the power that be? Every year at about this time oil marketers will go on strike bringing untold hardship to Nigerians Is it Not time for us to stand up and say No to these people? They don't mean well at all How long my piple. Enof is Enof.
419 2018-12-06 23:16:43 Update: my dad has now also changed my oil and detailed my interior. I don't deserve him.
420 2018-12-06 23:16:41 lol you're hilarious the US is there because that's where the oil and water is. You think they give a fuck about the Kurds all of a sudden? lol

426 2018-12-06 23:16:09 And perhaps someone who works for an oil company, also believes that they want to see racial justice, women's rights protected, and some other things Beto was for and Cruz was against, and thus donated, for conscience or morals or whatever, no?
427 2018-12-06 23:16:02 There are those who still falsely believe the USA fought the Iraq War for oil.
428 2018-12-06 23:15:47 Pillows, wallets, massage gift certificates, supplements, CBD oil and more!
Come in and see us...we would love to help you choose that perfect Christmas gift!
429 2018-12-06 23:15:44 Oil, salt, pepper and bake em... they are hella yummy!
430 2018-12-06 23:15:42 I use an essential oil blend called Deep Blue.  It works pretty well, but its pricey and I always smell like eucalyptus or whatever...maybe wintergreen?
431 2018-12-06 23:15:39 as for smells, i've found if i use things for long enough, even if they help at first, they eventually turn into migraine triggers. no idea why. i also used to use peppermint oil and peppermint wax! kind of a huge bummer to lose that.
432 2018-12-06 23:15:36 I’d rather be boiled in oil.
433 2018-12-06 23:15:19 it’s incredible how often i just remember the smell of linseed oil from oil painting class my senior year of high school
434 2018-12-06 23:15:16 I'll repeat. You don't own car insurance to get gas, oil, and wash your car do you?

436 2018-12-06 23:15:11 Had ours today...they setup an activity where we had to make a story out of a bag on our teams table filled with random items. One of the items....baby oil. Shit got weird real fast.
437 2018-12-06 23:15:07 Yb tell him to stop scandalizing palm oil & stop other  “ ngo “ from scandalizing something not proven 100%
438 2018-12-06 23:15:05 Dinesh D’Souza’s snake oil is definitely more palatable than Bill Kristol’s
439 2018-12-06 23:14:58 No mention of the US embargo.....yet another Latin American country where democracy is being squashed by the CIA. This is more regime change...same as Chile, Haiti, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Grenada, Argentina. The US want access to all the Latino oil and other resources.
440 2018-12-06 23:14:54 @rarami080203 フォロありがとうございます(*´ｪ`*)仲良くしてくださーい(*´ｪ`*)
441 2018-12-06 23:14:53 Best advice? Visit a dispensary. Trial/effort is required. I take 25 mg twice a day in gummies, but looking for a different option. The hemp CBD oil isn’t very good b/c hemp sucks toxins out of the soil and then you’re consuming that. I learned a lot online, but talk to the pros
442 2018-12-06 23:14:53 Opec may be on the verge of collapsing.  We always had these resources. But oil was cheap to buy.  But we got into complacency of buying and cowtowing to OPEC.
443 2018-12-06 23:14:46 i treated myself to some bobbi brown today because you lot went on about it so much and because they have an oil free foundation
444 2018-12-06 23:14:45 "The grooviest and phoniest things in the world cannot be fondled or even ingested - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
445 2018-12-06 23:14:30 Make sure your car is all ready for this chilly weather! A 21 point inspection is included with every oil change and a vehicle inspection is always available to be done separately! The snow is coming...make sure those tires are ready to handle it!
446 2018-12-06 23:14:24 Hopefully, someone realizes that our oil supply is finite and we should be looking at alternative energy. It obviously wont be you..
447 2018-12-06 23:14:23 You do realize that they were donated through A GODDAMN WEBSITE, RIGHT?!!!!

Your literally proposing that democrats now have to code their websites to reject donations from people who put "oil" or "gas" in one field.

LMAO, y'all are insane
448 2018-12-06 23:14:16 I work with two salesmen with new fords and they are always in the shop for def issues, engine sensors, engine problems and so on. Had a 550 at the farm and that thing was a POS, two engines..thankfully both under warranty. Cat issues, oil pump and a tranny.
449 2018-12-06 23:14:00 You using the oil from Walmart or the ones used in aroma therapy bc it’s different oils
450 2018-12-06 23:13:59 Can you give examples of alternatives to palm oil that are less sustainable, less regulated and more harmful to the environment?
451 2018-12-06 23:13:58 Make sure they put oil back in it this time!! (Wrong post on other tweet lol)
452 2018-12-06 23:13:56 Naa pas star oil skina canjulao HAHAHAHAH
453 2018-12-06 23:13:44 #SpecialReport These Senators are idiots the only one who will pay a price is the American people with higher oil prices and lost of weapons deals. #Russia and China will fulfill those requests. This guy #Khassogi was Part of Muslim brotherhood and none of our business forget it.
454 2018-12-06 23:13:42 Your question was in what world would someone afford $1000 to give to someone who would hurt their livelihood. I answered.

Maybe it is simply and utterly impossible that someone who works for an oil company really liked Beto O'Rourke's stances on civil rights, etc. I dunno.
455 2018-12-06 23:13:40 “We have to stop and air my tire up”
“Shit my gas light just came on”
“Oh wow I need an oil change”

I have been in the car with Santana for 30 minutes max and she has said all three of these
456 2018-12-06 23:13:31 それ、ドロップキックするわ。
457 2018-12-06 23:13:30 It was from oil and gas already purchased from Iran since the 1979 embargo, held in international accounts because of the sanctions. What do you think #sanctions are?
458 2018-12-06 23:13:29 Okay I actually don’t understand people that believe in marijuana oil, but not essential oils.. or vise versa..
I’ve heard it too many times.

Y’all know it’s like, the EXACT same thing right?

464 2018-12-06 23:12:41 I dont think Boeing could operate without their occasional help.  I know we wouldn't be able to launch satellites, drill for oil and a bunch of other things without them.  Fabulous aircraft.
465 2018-12-06 23:12:37 Bernie bro: posts false inflammatory statements

They were from *individuals* who identified as working in oil/gas

Why didn't you list how much Bernie took from PACs?  Wouldn't look good?  Spoil the frame?
466 2018-12-06 23:12:26 Coal is not a living thing, it's archaic. Same reason we don't use whale oil in lamps anymore, new things come along, better things, cleaner things. Why would we be stupid so that you can eek out the last penny to make yourself feel better about your erstwhile hollow life?
467 2018-12-06 23:12:25 So even if we seek to show the egregious state of mismanagement it under due to Wheatley, a whole lodda stuff was happening under Paulwell. 

So both parties should take the L. And them mussi follow the oil and lock up people on both sides.
468 2018-12-06 23:12:24 Russia, China & Cuba owns Venezuela. USA will never approve Rosnef buying Citgo to get paid. Venezuela's oil production is down to mere 1mm STB/day, not enough to pay Rosnef & China and "donate" 100K STBO/day to Cuba. Default is closer. Big Humanitarian Crisis exits in Venezuela
469 2018-12-06 23:12:24 oilとかすごくいいとこで入ってるじゃないですか！
頑張りましょ～！
470 2018-12-06 23:12:23 after not seeing many insider buys around holiday season 
lots of them hitting tonight
some that got my attention 
big one in $FOMX
oil plays $PE $MTDR $ECA
5k share buy in $DISH
lumber play $CTT
and an insider buy in a closed end MLP fund $NTG
471 2018-12-06 23:12:18 I am curious if KylieJenner allows Palm oil used in her products. She could be a huge asset for Rain forest and endangered species by stop using it or advertising she doesn't to help? #orangutan
472 2018-12-06 23:12:11 Guess what I got in the mail today!!! Cinnamon CBD oil! <3 It's like a hot cinnamon flavor and I love it!  WHO WANTS SOME?!?!

475 2018-12-06 23:12:05 Joe Gomez targets pair of Obama-era green rules to boost oil, coal
476 2018-12-06 23:12:03 And in other news: America just became a net exporter of crude oil.
477 2018-12-06 23:11:53 We have won 18 of them & will be thereabouts this year too. Chelsea & City lol, 2 small clubs that cheat with crooked oil money. We have more leagues & champions Leagues than both combined. Similar to PSG you know the club Neymar was desperate to leave Barca for. Even Roma beat u
478 2018-12-06 23:11:43 Oil and vinegar, vinaigrette, Italian, or French/Catalina. Nothing else.
479 2018-12-06 23:11:38 Not me, I got fooled enough. I'm waiting for March/April lows. I'm buying oil again around 42 to 43, unless we get the Putin bail out package tonight.
480 2018-12-06 23:11:35 Trump supporter: “Trump is for expanding the use oil and spreading pipelines.” Me: we need to focus on renewable energy instead of raping our lands. Them: “I won’t be here when it runs out so what’s the big deal?” 
481 2018-12-06 23:11:34 Too much oil na naman po ang prinoproduce ni atey sa kanyang face mamshwie! Hahahaha.

Hirap pag may pasok sa school. Di makainom ng tubig, yung tipong sa sobrang dami mong tubig na iniinom parang more than 84.5 times kang nag c-cr a day.

Wala lang. Skl.
482 2018-12-06 23:11:30 I once made pancakes and the recipe said to put oil in the pan and I didn't know how much and I put so much oil that it mixed with the mixture and I made fried clumps
483 2018-12-06 23:11:29 there wasn’t enough coconut oil to prepare for today’s chilling wind gusts
484 2018-12-06 23:11:20 @hicallmetay @coral_petrosius @jonathanmyersSF @empeterss @KittyBetzoldt @Curious3D 
Instead of using regular oil or butter, grab some bacon cook it till it's crispy, and use the bacon oil, not only do you have a delicious base for your roux but you can get ALL OF THE BACON.
485 2018-12-06 23:11:11 “Might as read snake oil”. What do you speak of good brother?
486 2018-12-06 23:11:02 I usually get my oil changed for $20  now they talking bout $41 and i can only think they only charging me double cause wryan with me this time 
487 2018-12-06 23:10:59  because us sewer rats know you weren't sincere when you apologized & because you never helped the multitude of oil field workers who desperately needed help that never happened.
488 2018-12-06 23:10:59 WTF is CBD oil?
489 2018-12-06 23:10:40 Metals have been hit hard lately, as has oil.  If you're interested, you should buy a low cost ETF or mutual fund with heavy exposure to both industries.  It's going to be a rough ride for a while, but they can't go much lower.  I own PICK and it's been hit hard.
490 2018-12-06 23:10:39 But there is little value in using PNP talking points in minimizing their role in it. The report goes back five years so 2014 and 2013 oil losses are to be counted. 

Between 2011 and 2016, PNP admin didn't see to it that the system purchased to verify orders was used.

494 2018-12-06 23:10:03 Oil oil oil
495 2018-12-06 23:09:29 au contraire our relationship runs as deep as the oil.
496 2018-12-06 23:09:21 Maybe Frank Stallone could pose by an oil drum fire pit and sing doo-wop for an alternate Philly style shot?
497 2018-12-06 23:09:15 @Fior_Sceal programme tonight on research funded by oil companies @Stanford in late 50s/early 60s would make anyone question how much pseudo-science is happening now @IrishEnvNet @foeireland @SCC_Ireland @350 @uccclimatelab @TyndallInstitut

501 2018-12-06 23:08:39 You can put conventional oil in pretty much any car. BUT I WANT SYNTHETIC LIKE I ALWAYS GET
502 2018-12-06 23:08:38 Oil price hike, nakaamba sa susunod na linggo #PangunahingBalita #DZRHNationwide @doe_ph
503 2018-12-06 23:08:35 Then ... the ultimate power game ... who owns battery power minerals. This is the end game for oil but it will last for decades as prices force capacities in and out.
504 2018-12-06 23:08:23 If there was a General Election, which wouldn’t happen until at least February, there’s no way a new Government, whoever that might be, would be able to negotiate a new Withdrawal Agreement in a month. We’d have to extend Article 50. Shami is selling snake oil.

505 2018-12-06 23:08:21 Highly suggest Saturn Riley Saturn spot sulfuric acid cream. I put it on on areas needed and kinda like cake it on a bit and it seems to really be helping , that whole acne line from them is amazing. Including the oil. Expensive but worthy
506 2018-12-06 23:08:11 I remind you that Guyana is a CLAIMING AREA OF #VENEZUELA SOLE LATINO COUNTRY WITH MORE OIL ZONES OK!
507 2018-12-06 23:08:03 I use batiste ! I also don’t use any shampoo with sulfates or parabens and I use coconut oil or argan oil products
508 2018-12-06 23:08:00 ダブルおめでした
509 2018-12-06 23:07:58 coconut oil smells so good, i’m about to risk it all and inhale it for hours
510 2018-12-06 23:07:46 IMO big threat 4 OPEC is there's a fairly rigid time-horizon on oil sales set by New Energy revol'n, so 1st to reduce supply now, gets stuck with the stranded asset, when it all hits the wall. Even coordination doesn't help if time-limited. Better sell now for w/ever u can get.
511 2018-12-06 23:07:40 Or perhaps build a bucket of water (or boiling oil) over said 'backdoor' 
I hope they do
512 2018-12-06 23:07:26 I remember the “good old days” when Alberta only wanted to benefit from the Alberta oil revenues and not Canada. And now times have changed and Canada’s involvement is needed? Remember Ralph Klein and his “Eastern Bastards freezing in the dark” comment? I do.
513 2018-12-06 23:07:18 Oh shooooot!!! Didnt even know the difference but I HAVE been sticking to one brand of coco oil so I probably found one that doesnt clog my pores hmmm.. maybe the clogging oily type is better for the feets
514 2018-12-06 23:07:05 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
515 2018-12-06 23:07:04 Crude oil prices are still dropping and yet we had a jump at the pump
516 2018-12-06 23:07:00 The Conservatives have been selling us out in Alberta for 40 years, under valuing our main export and not having the foresight to build infrastructure and pipelines 20 years ago, instead just continuing to hope oil prices stay high so they can make a quick buck.
517 2018-12-06 23:06:58 Stuck at the tire shop. Bought 4 brand new tires and an oil change. Been here almost 4 hours and they just said they don’t have the tires. Garbage.
518 2018-12-06 23:06:57 ありがとうございます
久しぶりの採用ですよ～
519 2018-12-06 23:06:37 This isn’t funny because she’s lucky this person didn’t used old motor oil or Mountain Dew, but at the same time it’s hard to feel bad when it’s 2018 and you let yourself fall into a trap like this.
520 2018-12-06 23:06:33 Why did I never catch Daryl calling Lori olive oil 
521 2018-12-06 23:06:30 No probs x just make sure you wash your hair thoroughly a few times otherwise it’ll be greasy and stringy once it’s dry  sometimes I put conditioner on first to help the oil wash out better and then shampoo twice 
522 2018-12-06 23:06:29 Coconut oil.
523 2018-12-06 23:06:25 My oil change light popped on in my car which is cool but he's too hot to check + it's getting dark so y'all don't let me forget to check tomorrow. Getting an oil change is nbd if I need one, even if it hasn't been long enough yet? It may have been something to do with the wreck
524 2018-12-06 23:06:22 Why do Albertans refuse to diversify their economy, then ask for special treatment during oil price slumps?
525 2018-12-06 23:06:16 You keep missing the vital part!! Voters put them there, citizens remain silent, uneducated on what’s going on. It will change if we demand/do it. Because enough believed the snake oil salesman,here we are.Our greed put us here,lack of compassion for others. We ALL own it.
526 2018-12-06 23:06:16 It looks delicious but the oil n.a......hum!
527 2018-12-06 23:06:14 Yeah, but who wants to think of oil as syrup or beer foam as dish liquid?  makes you loose your appetite.
528 2018-12-06 23:06:13 Perks of working at twin peaks: 
Sheriff fixing my speeding ticket & owner of a shop is coming pick my car up tomorrow while I’m at work to change my oil and do an alignment for free & drop it back off 
529 2018-12-06 23:06:12 So this would resemble oils on the surface of water (?), said surface representing a Standard Model brane & the oil’s action against the water (a few molecules thick in this example) representing dark matter repelling normal matter, best seen on the scale of a swimming pool?
530 2018-12-06 23:06:02 Although US frackers will be among first to be squeezed by falling  prices; All developed nation consumers benefit from cheaper oil.  Economic slowdown may also be reducing demand - Eurozone, Japan,  Australia have had weak Q3 GDPs.

534 2018-12-06 23:05:49 It just depends what type you get. most coconut oil that is meant for ur face is non comedogenic which means the oil won’t easily clog ur pores like comedegenic coco oil would.
535 2018-12-06 23:05:41 Peppermint essential oil will get rid of it in just a few minutes. Young living is what I used haven’t taken an aspirin in years now. A small dot on bot sides of my temples.

537 2018-12-06 23:05:37 This is assuming that we are in fact decarbonizing. But is that really the case? Gas and oil or growing unabated and coal is on the rise again.
538 2018-12-06 23:05:21 Lekki phase 1. Black bell, Admiralty way just a bit after Forte oil. Just had some

540 2018-12-06 23:04:38 9 is divine and 5 is for blessings... this is the last Trump... someone get some oil for the Shofar
541 2018-12-06 23:04:35 Con. and MAGAer tend to think climate change  is a lie. Clearly they have been won by Oil/Fracking $ manipul. Pro. Liberal. Dems are ready to die on that hill. And as the future is inevitable I tend to agree.
542 2018-12-06 23:04:29 I know!!! I’m so sorry  even the big oil analysts believed it would last longer. We should have known it was too good to be true.
543 2018-12-06 23:04:26 I know that there are area’s of problems but to say its world wide is wrong.  How about the oil disaster in the Gulf it’s gone and it was done by Humans it was cleaned up by nature
544 2018-12-06 23:04:10 People who know their essential oil shit...can I put drops of peppermint oil into capsules and just swallow them???
545 2018-12-06 23:03:57 Yep. I keep a fade (no brushing). My eyebrows and eyelashes are just there. My beard and mustache just grow thick, so not much beyond a trim and some oil.

Honestly, besides moisturizing, I literally have no worries until something hurts. And even then, it usually just goes away.
546 2018-12-06 23:03:36 Honestly people can get off wanking without using oil/cream so a bit of jeans friction is probably calm lol
547 2018-12-06 23:03:30 The best use of doggy bag steak is to chop it up, fry it with some olive oil, add cheese and you have the best cheese steak you ever had. Try it. It'll be the best you ever had. @MikeMiss975 has blind spots sometimes.
548 2018-12-06 23:03:28 A family member wanted me to use her homemade essential oil wipes on the lined, ventilated, very sick patient, instead of chlorhexidine. NOPE.
549 2018-12-06 23:03:13 Ahead of the #OPEC meeting, the Nigerian #oil minister stated that #Nigeria will struggle with production cuts due to economic constraints. He further explains that the lower the required cuts the more amenable for the country to participate.
550 2018-12-06 23:03:04 No worries, and thanks for getting back in touch...I really liked the coconut oil addition to it...it was so good!

Do you have any restaurant recommendations for Ethiopian food? I've only been to Cafe Lalilbela so far.
551 2018-12-06 23:02:57 They use to walk around the city with baby oil on and fishnet tees
552 2018-12-06 23:02:45 อยากได้ฟตก.ที่ทำแจกแล้ว สีมันน่ารัก ฮืออออ
553 2018-12-06 23:02:45 OIL WAX LOOK TOTE BAG WITH PURSE - GREEN
554 2018-12-06 23:02:43 I don’t use aloe unless I’m washing it afterwards, bc of the white flaky things lol but once I stopped using coconut oil, my curls were more defined and not as much breakage !
555 2018-12-06 23:02:31 But isn't that the deal @lydiaandwilly? He's a dumb lazy 'privileged' rich boy that failed at everything. His idea of a 'deal' is from the 1950's vacuum cleaner or snake oil salesmen. President of China knows how to use a computer, has scientists, economists and others on staff.
556 2018-12-06 23:02:25 Should've listen to PET and his NEP but you shit all over it...shot yourselves in the foot..."Let those bastards in the east freeze" infrastructure would've been build...Cons sold of Petro....guess who gets your oil cheap now!  Look in the mirror...the cons screwed you over!!!!!
557 2018-12-06 23:02:20 thank you!! they didn’t use a high developer so my hair isn’t fried like it’s been in the past when i’ve gone blonde so thank god. we have tons of masks & oil treatments so that’s what they do for me, i don’t wash my own hair anymore 
558 2018-12-06 23:02:19 @PETROLEUM
Oil prices and production must be formulated
Even if we use the International Monetary Fund
It became necessary to control this manipulation "oil and gas prices" need international control
,,,,
Thanks
559 2018-12-06 23:02:16 I need a oil change bad .. my car trippen
560 2018-12-06 23:02:05 What's wrong w coconut oil on yr face?? It clears up my teenager skin faster than no coco oil
561 2018-12-06 23:01:56 add oil!
562 2018-12-06 23:01:54 Put some oil on your cylinder too :)
563 2018-12-06 23:01:52 By the time we have rain the streets and highways are coated with a fine layer of oil that defeats most street friction. If the rain keeps up that might be gone in a few days but we've all skidded in traffic even in light rain and at moderate speeds.
564 2018-12-06 23:01:51 This is a retired teacher that would sooner buy Saudi oil than Alberta oil.  No credibility, hates Alberta, just supports Alberta separation sentiments!
565 2018-12-06 23:01:45 vavoline really is the place to go for oil changes tbh the workers are always nice too lol
566 2018-12-06 23:01:40 dairy products and I mix like oil and water
567 2018-12-06 23:01:38 Poor Girl, but sadly this will be another one of those stories that quickly gets brushed under the carpet, just like when that journalist Jamal Khashoggi who was killed inside the Saudi consulate #EscapeFromDubai Oil is King.

569 2018-12-06 23:01:26 Yeah, let's of emotion on this market. We sull haven't hit October lows again. Hold on if we got March lows. Putin better save shale or there's another massive leg down for oil and credit markets. Might be what gets us lower.
570 2018-12-06 23:01:16 Later jubril will say u are a lazy Nigerian youth....  The palm oil already looks juicy abeg.
571 2018-12-06 23:01:02 Bombardier governement assistance aside, and yes they've gotten a lot. The oil will move, whether pipeline, rail or truck and progressively less safe in that order, eg. Lac Megantic. Whether it comes via Alberta the rest of the country is still consuming, just from somewhere else
572 2018-12-06 23:00:55 Olive oil every night ;

575 2018-12-06 23:00:39 Best meal plan -if anyone doesn't know where to start: Big bowl of Green Salads with 1 piece of grass fed meat and some coconut oil or ghee.
576 2018-12-06 23:00:39 Oil/gas is 7% of GDP. With alternatives in commercial quantities not expected until 2030/40, dependance will continue for a good many years. With foreign investment declines of 26% since 2015, & an econ. plan replete w/ short-term measures, the focus need remain to fill coffers.

588 2018-12-06 22:59:55 It’s a Pisces Tings like if you guys had a essential oil it was be named “sex” 
589 2018-12-06 22:59:54 There is the whole of the scientific community, then that one guy the oil companies hired to say otherwise. 
Does she believe both sides of the science on smoking? 
Both sides of science on whether or not meth is bad you?
Is she working for oil and coal, or is she just stupid.
590 2018-12-06 22:59:43 I agree with you wholeheartedly. Trump wanted all of this yet the question is how was he going to compensate Putin for such riches, what was the reciprocity? As President he could relive sanctions on Russia & VTB Bank, give him Crimea rich with oil, a 50 Million penthouse..more
591 2018-12-06 22:59:39 Look at oil paintings of Thomas Moore, charles moore looks like his ancestor with #donaldtrump panda eyes, is it spray tan? #bbcqt
592 2018-12-06 22:59:38 Sir,did you got whole speech of this Saudi minister?If yes please put it in you tube.May be another reason for oil price drop,that is Modiji strong commitment to Solar and wind power generation.Jaiho Modiji
593 2018-12-06 22:59:38 The vegetable oil spoils the taste these days
594 2018-12-06 22:59:36 Clinical trails is something that you should look up and do. Before chemo. Especially #immunotherapy that’s the future. And get rid of all sugar and meat. CBD oil is also good, but not curing..
595 2018-12-06 22:59:35 going to be cheaper than to get it from Alaska..  #oil #gas #PermianBasin
596 2018-12-06 22:59:28 Its almost like an election is coming?  back off this, give away tax payer's money, putting oil on the "agenda", extended EI. but still will not have a seat from #ABpoli to #Mbpoli #cndpoli
597 2018-12-06 22:59:26 There's oil money in them there pockets
598 2018-12-06 22:59:20 I really recommend the Frizz Ease, you can probably do without the Moroccan oil. The Frizz Ease is great for in-between washing days too, just lightly spray on dry and run your fingers through em a couple of times and it sort of brings the loose hairs back into the curls.
599 2018-12-06 22:59:12 Omg... is there a natural oil or plant we’re missing out on orrrr

601 2018-12-06 22:59:00 Which brand are you taking? Not all cbd oil is the same. Many companies are jumping in the hemp train just to make  and are using fillers. You want to take pure organic oil with absolutely no additives or fillers. Other than that, it's rare for pure cbd not to work.
602 2018-12-06 22:58:58 * try and make sure it’s extra virgin organic olive oil x x
603 2018-12-06 22:58:54 Hopelessly OPEC shit be hose your hole oil flows as is, not unrestricted. The Hot Rocks does not penis to see, or dick, higher oil prices!
604 2018-12-06 22:58:43 OPEC to rescind Nigeria exemptions from oil production cuts
OPEC Basket price to reduce
Reduced prod'n + reduced oil price is low Income

@nassnigeria increases expenditure with New Tertiary Institutions midst of ASUU strikes

Unbelievable!
How do you explain this?
605 2018-12-06 22:58:37 Experimented a bit - true PDSA style  warmed up trays in the oven plus brushed tins with oil and sprinkled semolina - base had a golden hue; superbly crisp and dry.
606 2018-12-06 22:58:30 Olive oil. Absolutely drench your hair in that stuff. Tie it up. Leave for a few hours or preferably overnight and then thoroughly wash out with shampoo the next day (might need to wash through twice). Do this twice a week 
607 2018-12-06 22:58:28 Wait till American oil workers, who support you, start getting laid off. And you don’t understand that your Saudi buddies for whom you’re currently covering are actively working to undercut your American supporters. How come you don’t know that? #DisunitedStatesOfTrumpistan
608 2018-12-06 22:58:22 When cooking Asian food why does the gwailo always cook with sesame oil...like add that shit after
609 2018-12-06 22:58:17 The oil of the menorah burned for 8 days and the oil from my first chanukkah jelly donut seems like it’s gonna give me heartburn for 8 days too.

612 2018-12-06 22:57:50 The UNITED STATES is NOW the LEADING Oil Producing Country in the WORLD.  The U.S. no longer depends on OPEC!  LOWER GAS PRICES at the PUMP!  Thanks to President Trump @realDonaldTrump #MAGA #OANNRealNews

616 2018-12-06 22:57:35 Yes!! Definitely learned the hard way with this, I burned my face . I take a cotton pad and drench it in water then I add a few drops of the tea tree oil on the pad. I use it as a toner and it keeps my face pimple free!

620 2018-12-06 22:57:14 The coconut oil is so good for you. But the feel of it grossed me out. I just skip the oil. Been tooth infection free since i started making my own in 2012
621 2018-12-06 22:57:09 買う気満々じゃ〜ん
622 2018-12-06 22:57:03 And oh boy, this person thinks *Russia* was at some point governed justly before oil drilling started. Never thought I’d see an SJW  idealize serfdom.
623 2018-12-06 22:57:00 What puzzles me about this line of criticism of him is that Hillary made a whole campaign ad raising the exact same criticism of Obama. And she was right to warn us about the individual donations flowing to him from oil industry employees!
624 2018-12-06 22:56:52 Someone send Jihoon coconut oil and aloe vera seriously
625 2018-12-06 22:56:50  lie.. it's groundnut oil oooo
626 2018-12-06 22:56:49 everytime i look around i need a new oil filter
627 2018-12-06 22:56:36 Bro in lagos. Welcome
628 2018-12-06 22:56:35 Oh my god. Driving the bimmer after new tires, alignment, oil change, and having everything else looked over... this is what life is about. I love this car.
629 2018-12-06 22:56:32 YES I DO lemongrass is my favorite! I have a tiny spray bottle that I put water in then add drops of the oil (feel free to mix oils too!) until it’s fitting. Use to spray around a room. My favorite during the day is to spray on the insides of my wrists!
630 2018-12-06 22:56:31 A quick clarification: we have a moratorium on oil exploration/exploitation since early 2000s. It is not a phase out as such, but the bigger point is that the political will was there and is still there to not become oil producers. More info at rhe side event at COP24 this Monday
631 2018-12-06 22:56:26 Question: Did the same oil execs give to Cruz, and to the same extent? Anywhere close? Cause in the end, unless we can show some other form of influence peddling, legislator be judged by his votes. 
Maybe big fossil dudes figured "Beto has a real chance, let's hedge bets here"

633 2018-12-06 22:56:24 I was 14. Eat them raw. Taste nothing like sprouts. Actually really nice. No cooking, nuts, oil, bacon. Just raw.

635 2018-12-06 22:55:59 TFW you clean out your car and think it drives better, like you’re not 6000 miles overdue on an oil change. 
636 2018-12-06 22:55:51 Your boy is an expert when it comes to extra virgin olive oil
637 2018-12-06 22:55:51 Lay off all the white ppl in oil and gas replace with black ppl in hydro and solar so we can all pay more for the same electricity. I’m sure it’ll work out great.
638 2018-12-06 22:55:46 Mix flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt in a large microwave-safe mug; stir in milk, canola oil, water, and vanilla extract.
Cook in a microwave until cake is done in the middle, about 1 minute 45 seconds.
639 2018-12-06 22:55:43 Right, then bypass Quebec. Build a new bitumen upgrader in Fort Mac. And a shorter, simpler pipeline to Churchill. Tankers can break sea ice year round. Displace foreign oil feeding Montreal and Saint John refineries.
640 2018-12-06 22:55:43 Simple...garlic, chilli, olive oil, and parsley!
641 2018-12-06 22:55:41 Hahaha @babssheking has blocked me cos she didn’t like my response to her inane comment about the oil industry. I’m devastated. Not.

644 2018-12-06 22:55:28 We can plant & harvest 1 ha of canola on about 20 litres of diesel fuel.
The yield on this would be about 2400 kgs of canola which when crushed should produce 1100 litres of canola oil which is the same as diesel. 
Agriculture uses solar energy to recycle green house gas
645 2018-12-06 22:55:18 What is a viable alternative to all the petrochemical products extracted from this oil? And how much genuine influence can SNP have when the rights are being sold by Britain? Ever tried negotiating with INEOS? They are kind of obstructive.
646 2018-12-06 22:55:12 That’s such BS any moron would have looked good when oil was $100/barrel there was no vision for the future with KING RALPH  HE SLASHED INFRASTRUCTURE and we are still paying for that now with run down schools and hospitals! But I can see you bought his line of BS
647 2018-12-06 22:55:00 Fed Dot Plot

650 2018-12-06 22:54:41 Steady on. I was born during the war (WW2), brought up on a diet of cod liver oil and concentrated orange juice. All my memories of the 40's and 50's are in black and white like the films. I could go on.Title of Lib Metropolitan Elite conferred and you say it was easy. Humph. 
651 2018-12-06 22:54:35 oil diffusers #1 ! I also love wax warmers
652 2018-12-06 22:54:31 Chose our own oil adventure??  Lot of room for data and grouping uncertainty. Looks set for data dependent fuzziness to continue. And we will be back to monthly/quarterly reviews. After all past commitments were reviewed at each meeting anyways rather than hard Fwd guidance
653 2018-12-06 22:54:28 'Unicorn pussy oil' was very very funny to me.
654 2018-12-06 22:54:23 hate getting my oil changed 
655 2018-12-06 22:54:19 Exactly...for over a century the oil industry has done away with one competitor after the other, so that we all depend on oil and its spin offs. 
Workers are useful to the industry to work the fields during booms, and for exciting 'empathy' when they are looking for more welfare.
656 2018-12-06 22:54:08 Patrick I have reviewed the earth day web site from 1970, of course the alarmingly heavy words were in play then, suffocated fresh water fish, mass starvation, no copper leaf, zinc or oil, Paul Ehrlich said 200,000 Americans would die in 1973 of smog. Now CNN has us under water
657 2018-12-06 22:54:07 Really want to know the answer to this, but is this a product of European taxes on fuel, or this the price that it takes to bring oil to Europe? UK and Norway are pretty big oil producers, so really curious as to the discrepancy.
658 2018-12-06 22:53:44 6.68-92
Alcinous grants Naus use of wagon. Servants prepare it, Naus loads clothes & gets on, her mother gives her food, wine and oil to anoint herself. Naus whips the horses & speeds off with maids. They reach the washing-places & stamp clean the clothes in the running water.
659 2018-12-06 22:53:40 Of I’m not wrong, Canada’s emissions (and targets) only count domestic emissions from Tar Sands production, not the massive emissions which result from other countries burning exported Tar Sands oil
660 2018-12-06 22:53:23 Ha ha, that's amazing. "Dear random website user, we don't care about your personal politics or your position in the oil and gas industry, if you donate here we'll reject it." Great plan!
661 2018-12-06 22:53:18 Especially with the price of oil getting hammered
662 2018-12-06 22:53:09 "Oil be back".
663 2018-12-06 22:53:09 Ummm the US Geological survey did not discover this.   The oil & gas companies in the Delaware basin did.
664 2018-12-06 22:53:05 Cracking up with my daughter watching @CouplesCourt_TV this episode there were a lot of funny comments. They should just buy coconut oil in bulk

671 2018-12-06 22:52:41 Thanks brilliant, like really really good  well done Pearse reminds me a little of George Galloway was summoned to the hearings on oil for money deals and the Americans thinking what have we done? when George was finished with them
672 2018-12-06 22:52:36 After the split only half of them get the oil. Others have the packet.
673 2018-12-06 22:52:20 @ the universe... my skin everywhere else on my body is soft and supple yet somehow my cheeks and my chin are DRYER THAN THE SAHARA and it is literally not fair and I would like a refund... how much oil do I need to put onto my face for it to be absorbed into my skin!!!!!!!

679 2018-12-06 22:51:14 Are the Premiers surprised they are going to get a “ talk down” from PMJT.  Western premiers had to ask to get -oil- on the agenda. JT are you and  Butts really brain dead. Drama JT drama!
680 2018-12-06 22:51:13 So she believes in the 99% of scientists around the world that believe we are a major cause of climate change...and she also believes in that 1% of scientists on the payrolls of big oil.
681 2018-12-06 22:51:10 Fracking is not what you want anywhere in Canada. We've seen fire on tap water due to fracking chemical migration. Earthquakes in areas that don't have earthquakes. I understand the need to break past the oil market. Don't destroy people's lives for oil.
682 2018-12-06 22:50:51 Have you tried CBD cream or oil?

Evey country is different though, it depends
692 2018-12-06 22:50:26 you should make your own - a jar of organic unsweetened peanut butter, a dash of water and a dash of oil and warm it up.
693 2018-12-06 22:50:09 I saw this, everyone’s skin is different that lady had a super extreme reaction. If you’re scared you can mix tea tree oil with a carrier oil like olive, jojoba, avocado and all those other ones. I use it with witch hazel. For spot treating only
694 2018-12-06 22:50:08 I'm sorry to hear that you're ill. There isn't "both sides". There aren't 2 kinds (or more) of medicine. There is medicine that has been tested and proven to work with peer reviewed studies, and there is sham snake oil salesmen that push untested, unregulated products that don't.

697 2018-12-06 22:49:54 Opposition parties say they’d leave the oil in the ground, but I suspect, now we all know its there & plentiful, they need a way to play the too poor card again. @ross_greer should fight for #scotref 1st, not side with unionists & then perhaps try persuading Scots to vote Green.

701 2018-12-06 22:49:30 That's really not that striking. There are few oil sands jobs in Toronto and The Star is a local paper. If the Calgary Herald or the Edmonton journals said it, that would be striking.
702 2018-12-06 22:49:27 Is there a way I can find a list that states the purpose of each oil? I know if i Google i can find the uses for basic oils, but this picture is mentioning ones I’ve never heard of for some great uses.

711 2018-12-06 22:48:35 The science is clear enough I suppose, but the politics around whose oil gets to be in the 20% and whose in the 80% is a little murkier... is it a race to get as much of ours out as we can before we all have to stop? Or are we not going to stop?
712 2018-12-06 22:48:34 Sirota tried to back away, but the tweet and RT don't make sense of they're NOT referring to Corp. $$, which is the impression you, I, and everyone would think upon reading "Oil/Gas Co. Industry" on a list where Beto's between Cruz and Ryan.  So, not just "political differences."
713 2018-12-06 22:48:29 I agree but the oil losses went to 49,000 below industry standards in 2015. Then when the JLP won they fired the head of security who was hired by the PNP and changed the management. Then the Minister opened Gas stations. As u said tip of the iceberg.
714 2018-12-06 22:48:28 The Big Oil elites have fallen for the myth that only the poor people in foreign countries who don't create wealth for them will suffer. They think their bunkers in New Zealand will save them. If they thought for one minute they would die from climate change they would shut down.
715 2018-12-06 22:48:18 I know that oil or vitamin company dropped her. But her name comes up immediately in google search. Her real estate company comes up immediately. In a few weeks, this will blow over (disgusting) but her name is out there. There truly is no bad press.

740 2018-12-06 22:45:01 you are not being honest at all - no matter how many times you are shown empirical evidence you will ignore it in favour of your own predetermined belief. Membership in APEGA is a prerequisite to a job with an oil, gas, or mining company, but they're not bias right

794 2018-12-06 22:38:21 49,000 is below the industry standard. There is nowhere in the world where oil is not lost. That’s his point. Measures were put in place such as the hiring of a security firm who were fired when the JLP came into power.

821 2018-12-06 22:34:58 This whole insurance scam has gotten completely out of hand. Do you have car insurance that pays for your oil changes, fuel or car washes? No, you have car insurance to pay for an accident.

826 2018-12-06 22:34:25 Get back in the Paris Accord and participate in the energy economy of the future—where the future is being determined.  The answer is a balanced portfolio-coal, oil, wind, solar, nuclear—all of it.
827 2018-12-06 22:34:16 Hmmmmm, so keep the $$ in the USD account. 

That's my gut feeling to, but I have no "rigorous" argument. Just "no oil exports, CAD will tank" .
828 2018-12-06 22:34:16 It is possible to vote and campaign against your own immediate financial interests. That is what I do (gave limit to Beto and work with oil industry). That is what we all must do to avert a climate catastrophe. Reducing our carbon footprint has real costs, costs we must pay.
829 2018-12-06 22:34:01 I support the need to reduce the use of Palm Oil, however, the industry supports millions of individuals directly + millions of families secondary to those individuals - I hope companies are supporting the retraining/upskilling of vulnerable communities as rapidly as removal!

833 2018-12-06 22:33:44 The film tells it like it is, and has been for 44-45 years. It's all about oil, all the way back to Pearl Harbor.
834 2018-12-06 22:33:43 Make your own with coconut oil, baking soda and mint essential oil !!!
835 2018-12-06 22:33:42 Oddly enough. Wti down 3% and wcs up 12%.  The Canadian oil patch now so undervalued that it’s a huge buy.  If opec+ does curtail production by 1mm b/d, wti likely up $3 or 5% and wcs up 10%. I know it’s all relative but it matters both going down and up.
836 2018-12-06 22:33:37 if data is the oil and we are the product, what will they do to mine us when they already hurt papatuanuku and kill for oil? constant war, surveillance, was 1984 an instruction manual? #standupforus #ifyoutoleratethisthenyourchildrenwillbenext #ban5g

847 2018-12-06 22:31:13 #DiegoDog says...But look at all the witches that were caught. Tax cuts to the 1%, deregulating coal mining and oil drilling, criminal judges is not accomplishment. On Vets Day you showed how you really feel about military and vets. I’m surprised you are at 50% after all of that.
848 2018-12-06 22:31:10 Hmmm... does this include cannabis oil?

858 2018-12-06 22:30:16 Damion is making the point about the missing oil. That measures were put in place to decrease oil loss to accepted international standards. Then when the JLP won they fired the head of security and changed management which lead to further losses. Your response is pointless.

864 2018-12-06 22:29:49 They have a fortune in oil and minerals. South Africa has diamond mines and plenty of arable land, and beaches for tourism and so on. Botswana has a fortune in diamond mines. The same can be said of Namibia and Angola, and they also also have uranium, gold, copper and fossil fuel

867 2018-12-06 22:29:44 I am talking based on the scale of the local market. Last I checked Petrojam was the single largest user of FX, buying close to USD 2 billion of oil each year. Yes loses high, but not too high the oil game. You simply cannot compare oil to any other industry

870 2018-12-06 22:29:21 I fully expect even the hint of oil interests will be toxic in the 2020 dem primaries.

872 2018-12-06 22:29:06 Good, you can shut down too, mate. Your comment just now is a joke: 41 wasn't reelected due to lying about raising taxes and his vendetta against Hussein causing soldiers to die. Don't forget the oil. No longer a fan. Brain dead as @TheJuanWilliams
873 2018-12-06 22:29:04 I hate the experience of getting an oil change. They try to up sell EVERY step of the process. In fact, I hate it so much, I think I’m just going to start buying a new car every 3000 miles.
874 2018-12-06 22:28:58 @Barclays I've been a customer for nearly 20 years.  Pained to learn about the terrible decision to invest in tar sands oil extraction. Not only a shocking idea environmentally but also economically. Fossil fuels are dead. Literally. Time to close my account. #Barclays
875 2018-12-06 22:28:53 Update: borrowed some oil
876 2018-12-06 22:28:40 Borrowing FRNs, @ interest, from a private corp, who set its’ value thru LIBOR, forced demand tax payment in FRN & the Democratization of countries selling oil outside of the FRN T-Bill.  Idiot.  

This brazen fuck has no morals.
877 2018-12-06 22:28:39 The other side of science is that gross oil money check to pay for her drug and shopping and makeup habits and her plastic surgery and lipo
878 2018-12-06 22:28:14 People saying check illegal petrol shops and you will find the location of some of the missing oil. So based on my little research crude oil is pretty much useless without being refined. Crude oil is normally what we receive in barrels.
879 2018-12-06 22:28:08 Coconut products. Sweet, savoury, and of course coconut oil has multiple different uses

Hopefully we invest in solar and wind technology and have all electric cars and houses
Hopefully we figure out how to live in harmony with each other and the environment
Hopefully we learn how better to take care of Earth

892 2018-12-06 22:26:56 Off topic, what brand of CBD oil do you recommend. We can finally buy it in AR but options are limited. All the info I’ve found just seems like advertising. Just want a legit product for inflammation.
893 2018-12-06 22:26:52 'Oil industry campaign cash'

That was a vicious lie
894 2018-12-06 22:26:50 What evidc is there it was coordinated? AFAICT,David Sirota brought up Betos being top oil donation recipient, tho seemingly w/o immediate context that Beto's also top recipient from other industries. Then Beto suptrs attacked David & Bernie, then DS & Bernie suptrs defended them
895 2018-12-06 22:26:46 If all else fails, and the woman refuses, I recommend using peppermint oil to block out the scent. I apply it to the back of my neck and temples and it both helps relax me (perfume triggers panic bc it’s such a trigger) and blocks the offending scent.
896 2018-12-06 22:26:41 Friend, because he was running in Texas. It’s like saying why NY Democratic candidate has lot of individual contributions from Financial industry. Lot of people in Texas work in oil and gas industry. Lot of voted for Beto with their wallet.

902 2018-12-06 22:26:18 The US has recently built 90,000 km of oil pipelines. It’s not that hard to do. It just means that there is a planned effort to prevent pipeline construction. Both by a market collusion and our own government.

Buyers pay 133% taxes.                 That means total #Tax people pay is 155$ . #Saudi sell a barrel for 55$ and the #French buy it for 220$ don’t blame Saudi for that crime.
912 2018-12-06 22:24:57 @LindseyGrahamSC Sir, I respect you and your service BUT, surely you have given serious consideration to what will happen to the price of a barrel of oil and the impact that will have to America's economy if we abandon the Saudi's? We are truly looking at National Security. $7.00

921 2018-12-06 22:24:04 OPEC can not defeat shale. If oil goes to $20 a barrel for 3 years, all the shale companies will go bankrupt, but the oil will still be in the ground. New buyers will buy the assets for pennies on the and voila, you have an even lower breakeven.

924 2018-12-06 22:23:17 This agreement that Zinke just shit-canned was an 8 year bi-partisan process.

932 2018-12-06 22:22:38 Have to agree with Arouet. Oil is a mess. No voting reform (not that I expected it but he did promise)... Lots of costumes, foreign visits, vacations, and bhangra dancing. And pc platitudes constantly. What has he really accomplished?

936 2018-12-06 22:22:18 Late on the lice wagon  I’ve got a curly girl and use a natural spray In her hair (and my sons) every day. Super easy - I make it at home. Knock on wood - haven’t had any buggers since. Tea tree - lavender oil - peppermint oil and water in a spray bottle. Good luck!
937 2018-12-06 22:22:18 broke with expensive taste is about me with cheese and olive oil
938 2018-12-06 22:22:13 I wash my face with water am and pm I double cleanse. I oil cleanse with kose speedy oil cleanser then I use Dr Song Benzoyl Peroxide Wash 10% Acne Treatment for my 2nd cleanse. I mostly use amazon because I love my prime 2 day shipping
939 2018-12-06 22:22:08 nah just undiluted tea tree oil! it's fine if it's inside another product, it works really well for spot treatment.
940 2018-12-06 22:22:07 How is Beto an oil and gas shill?
941 2018-12-06 22:22:05 Because employees checked a box, it's somehow taking money from the gas & oil industry. Bernie took hordes of cash directly from the NRA. Not employee contributions. The old guy just can't handle the fact he won't be the Democrat nominee. He'll run third-party to siphon dem votes
942 2018-12-06 22:21:56 “what u got a instagram & u not even gonna follow me” .... no now finish changing my oil so i can go home lmao
943 2018-12-06 22:21:55 Not changing my oil so this light can stay on and light my dash like a Christmas tree
944 2018-12-06 22:21:53 can dry out to be too brittle... but then again can always make it into oil
945 2018-12-06 22:21:47 あのツイートとか含め何故かジュク女上品みたいな話を見るんだけど、別にどっちも普通じゃない？って不思議な顔してるジュク推し
946 2018-12-06 22:21:37 Does anyone have a longer dipstick, mine isn’t reaching the oil anymore :(
947 2018-12-06 22:21:37 Who uses peppermint and tea tree oil without a carrier oil  haaaowa mahn
948 2018-12-06 22:21:32 Ok, I'm an academic.  Ivory tower.  Can't change my car's oil.  How the hell do we do that? I never did it...  I mean, I could draft a statement, but how do we post/publicize right a site to get signatories?
949 2018-12-06 22:21:30 " ' Well there is only one piece of advice I can give you,' said the wisest of wise men.
The secret of happiness is to see all the marvels of the world, and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.' "
950 2018-12-06 22:21:29 There are some Albertans who feel they're getting a raw deal by the Feds. Especially on the pipeline. Do you blame them for being angry? We're Canada's bitch. They use our oil and our money and when we need them we get the finger.
951 2018-12-06 22:21:25 The castor oil seems to work but as soon as I go more than a week w/o this treatment my hair looks horrible. Just part of the disease & medication..will be good to know what other products that might help. Next time I head up town Im checking Sallys & the store in Aberdeen mall
952 2018-12-06 22:21:22 Who’s Dan? I’m David Greco. I’m just a professional podcast sidekick, I bring the humor and the jape. Say what are these Juul things? Are they like new smoking jewelry? Like a smoking necklace? Oh come on that’s good comedy. Hey what happened with the BP oil spill? They fix that?
953 2018-12-06 22:21:17 Yes and regard to oil prices it is close to a pleasure to fill up at gas station.  Home heating prices also.   I am not sure many make the connection
954 2018-12-06 22:21:14 オリーブ油で毎日を楽しく(*^_^*)
955 2018-12-06 22:21:12 Worked there for 10 years women- minorities are well protected by the oil industry.
956 2018-12-06 22:20:57 Mmm...... I have over a dozen years experience of the OFFSHORE  Oil & Gas sector in Scotland and ME..... Goodnight.
957 2018-12-06 22:20:56 Just tried CBD oil.. noice !!!
958 2018-12-06 22:20:56 Ich nur Oil of Olaf
959 2018-12-06 22:20:55 All my toys/tools here to change my oil the less complicated way  let’s get started.. bye y’all
960 2018-12-06 22:20:49 Anyone who thinks oil is dying is poorly informed
961 2018-12-06 22:20:48 Let's hope we never get to a point where it's put to the test. Massive difference between oil/gas supply and things like medicines and perishable foods. Not saying it can't be done. Saying it can't be done in <4months.
962 2018-12-06 22:20:46 what is wrong with pointing out that beto took money from oil & gas? seriously. why do you have a problem with that?
963 2018-12-06 22:20:32 Yeh I get what you mean but it’s just an added boost. Especially for woman things like Evening Primrose Oil do seem to help.
964 2018-12-06 22:20:31 Lo se, nosotros estamos cosechando tambien y HOY recibimos 3000 litros de gas oil que nos da para una semana aprox. Estamos en Soriano
965 2018-12-06 22:20:27 @rotobuzzguy .5 ppr Winston or Goff? AND Need 3 of Landry, Sutton, Lockett or Drake? #HappyHanukkah fantasy team burning like that oil, all the way to the end!

967 2018-12-06 22:20:17 reading skin care tips on the internet just makes me realise how literally know one knows what’s going on like should i use concentrated tea tree oil? should i dilute it? give me one answer pls-
968 2018-12-06 22:20:13 was slabbering to my oil company that it didn’t arrive to only then find the receipt under the door stopper  at my front door. . I quickly stfu.
969 2018-12-06 22:20:10 
970 2018-12-06 22:20:10 It's a changeable paper filter..
Is full synthetic oil change but I think it'll go 8000
971 2018-12-06 22:20:06 And, individuals have to put their profession on their donation, and there’s lots of Texans who happen to work for oil & gas companies, Beto raised a lot of money from Texans, therefore he raised a lot of money from people who are employed by oil & gas companies
972 2018-12-06 22:20:05 TEXAS AG COMMISSIONER SID MILLER CALLS ON CONGRESS TO LIFT FEDERAL RESTRICTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL HEMP PRODUCTION. Hemp is  the source of a sturdy fiber & CBD oil, a substance widely used for medical purposes. The provision is included in the new 2018 Farm Bill before Congress.
973 2018-12-06 22:20:04 A cut of lemon or lime (lemon usually). Twist it over the glass to release/spray some of the oil onto the rim and into the glass and then drop it in.

975 2018-12-06 22:19:59 I notice it’s gone from climate change to climate change crisis, can you imagine being Premier and having to sit through half hour of this sh#t so you can get 5 minutes on Oil plunging to negative levels and thousands out of work
976 2018-12-06 22:19:54 banzo flour + turmeric + nutritional yeast + kala namak + garlic powder + salt and pepper + little bit of oil so that it doesnt stick to pan + water until it reaches a pourable consistency

rly easy to eyeball everything n then just cook it in a pan like a pancake
977 2018-12-06 22:19:48 Lol I have an appointment for an oil change in 10 minutes 20 minutes away...gage still isn’t home with the car, I’m not wearing a shirt or shoes and Dylan is asleep on my chest. Oops.

981 2018-12-06 22:19:22 Oil needs to go lower I guess
982 2018-12-06 22:19:22 Oil/serum then moisturiser or moisturiser then oil/serum 
983 2018-12-06 22:19:21 Stop subsidizing profitable industries like oil. 

Start spending on more efficient tech like nuclear, solar, wind, basically anything.

You're a slave to obsolete industries.
984 2018-12-06 22:19:17 I was having problems with tendonitis in various parts of my body several months back (Achilles, hips and bicep insertion tendonitis) from pole. Asked my doctor whether taking fish oil tablets might help. She said there's some research to say it works.
985 2018-12-06 22:19:14 #yyccc should be asking the feds for 3 things:

1. An upstream emissions assessment on the Saudi Crude oil currently making its way up the St. Lawrence

2. A Carbon tarriff on this imported oil.

3. An upstream gender impact assessment thereupon.
986 2018-12-06 22:18:56 オイル、君なら地球を救える。
987 2018-12-06 22:18:41 I have  experience of offshore Oil & Gas, in the North Sea basin as well as experience of the mega projects in Dubai - you are talking as we say in Scotland shite.
988 2018-12-06 22:18:41 Yoooo that's the even crazier part about it!!!

I had to wait a lil longer because someone literally ran to the store to go pick up an oil filter for my car because they didn't have one on hand!!!

They did the oil change, I just don't understand how 
989 2018-12-06 22:18:40 というか、本人凍結か垢消しで消えたなら、晒した人ツイート消しといた方がいいんじゃないかなぁ。あの晒した人は結局晒すだけ晒して放置？
990 2018-12-06 22:18:35 Their silent flute dabbed in harp oil (for the strings) teased their downstairs mouth
991 2018-12-06 22:18:31 Yeah I agree with Liz about Beto (I like Bernie), but I totally agree that Sirota is being very disingenuous. For the size of Beto's total contributions, and how many people in Texas work for the oil and gas industry, getting $400k in individual contributions seems fine
992 2018-12-06 22:18:28 Assalamualaikum.
The Exploration & Production co.s,in a remarkable progress,have made 13 oil & gas discoveries in dif parts of the country in last 4 months
As per the initial assessmnt,the new finds’ overall rate of gas flow is around 105.18 MMCFD & 5358 bbl oil per day.
993 2018-12-06 22:18:13 You’re right, I just need to find an oil version of the scents I like I guess. I like more linen, not to warm not too fruity
994 2018-12-06 22:18:00 The ones who run this earth( Big Oil) will destroy it before giving up its power to a new energy source. The day we can take money out of the equation is when global warming will be fixed!
995 2018-12-06 22:17:43 Couldn't care less about the weed, but the CBD oil that comes with it is a revelation.
996 2018-12-06 22:17:34 I just snorted an olbas oil stick (sexy) forgetting I had covered my nostils in vaseline (sexier) which in essence is the same as putting vicks vapour rub up your nose.

SEND FOR THE PRIEST, MY NOSE OVARIES ARE ON THE EXPRESS ELEVATOR TO HELL!!!!!
997 2018-12-06 22:17:32 Read Ways of Seeing (free online) if you want to see a cool thing on how capitalism shaped oil painting in a weird way
998 2018-12-06 22:17:29 Getting my oil changed for the first time by myself lol
999 2018-12-06 22:17:27 .When #Saddam was cornered, he burned his country (oil fields); When Saddam #Trump is cornered by Mueller & Dems, he’ll try to  burn down America, starting w/ Congress, DOJ, & economy
1000 2018-12-06 22:17:25 Anyways, the reason Beto is the #2 recipient of “oil & gas money” or whatever is that he raised oodles of cash this year — while eschewing corporate PAC $ — so he’s pretty much a top recipient for most industries.
1001 2018-12-06 22:17:23 Oh, please.  There is a reason nearly all developed countries, save for a few oil exporters/Asian countries, have been running large sustained trade deficits with China.
1002 2018-12-06 22:17:22 I am old enough to remember a woman beheaded in the street by Saudi authorities. But then again it was just a few years ago
1003 2018-12-06 22:17:21 But cannabis oil basically CURES it xxx
1004 2018-12-06 22:17:19 I'm serious folks it's so cold here in Northern Maine that our heating degree days are high 
Seniors will have hard time extra month of heating oil.
Bloomberg doesn't care he spent millions getting extra welfare here in Maine millions
1005 2018-12-06 22:17:14 He had a couple votes in favor of the oil lobby. One on offshore drilling, another to approve exporting US crude.
1006 2018-12-06 22:17:14 You support
Subsidizing big oil and
Tax cut for corporations
Corporate welfare
YET
don't want your constituents to have preexisting conditions coverage or 10 essential health benefits of #ACA
Or
Middle class tax cuts
You are a hypocrite

1009 2018-12-06 22:16:56 I know, but you gotta be ready for the pics, so it's worth the effort lol (also use baby oil to get it off) 

And passing out seems like a good option, you could be like, "oh hi-" and drop to the floor. That'd be quite an entrance, my friend
1010 2018-12-06 22:16:41 There’s a witch in Virginia called Sabrina. Her hobbies include oil painting and tending to her succulents.
1011 2018-12-06 22:16:29 Obama Treasonous Acts List.
23. He instructed his Interior Secretary to ignore the orders of Federal courts to lift a moratorium on Deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, which denied oil workers an opportunity to earn a living and damaged the U.S. economy

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
1015 2018-12-06 22:15:56 I think that people are seeing this “appearance” such as it is, to be a very thin veneer tinged with snake oil.
1016 2018-12-06 22:15:53 Went to the chiropractor and now I feel like I can lift my car up and change the oil without a jack or anything
1017 2018-12-06 22:15:37 4) let's defend our oil and gas sector - we produce the most  environmentally and socially responsible energy any place on this planet.  We need to dispute any myths and lies spread by then foreign activists masquerading as charities
1018 2018-12-06 22:15:33 my sister decided to put oil in the curry and i ate it now i feel sick i think i should sue her :/
1019 2018-12-06 22:15:30 The world has no respect  for "ex" neither does it regard "former". Jesus the same yesterday, today and forever... You need oil to stay current and relevant. You need not expire! Elastic money LOADING!!!
1020 2018-12-06 22:15:25 いや、まあ、リアルマネーで動いてたら多少ギスギスもするか……でも、必死だからってあんな分かりやすい煽りにさぁ……
1021 2018-12-06 22:15:08 Right.  So let the Saudi prince off for the execution because we need oil prices low.  What would you have done if it had been your daughter or son?
1022 2018-12-06 22:15:04 No you are correct Chris !!! So, theoretically YOU could hold the license for OUR fields of oil ???
1023 2018-12-06 22:14:48 I lost a bottle of CBD oil 2 years ago and just found it lol.
1024 2018-12-06 22:14:48 Because big oil is paying them NOT TO.
1025 2018-12-06 22:14:46 Thank you for fighting for our environment.  Presently we have a leader who is allowing the oil industry to destroy our lands.  Carte Blanche
1026 2018-12-06 22:14:45 For God’s sake! Bury the man! The media crucified him - remember blood for oil? They are dragging this out to come back on Trump.I m a republican, but so disappointed w 41 and 43!! They knew how deep corruption was/is n our gov but chose political path.
1027 2018-12-06 22:14:41 There's a belief that what we see online is democratic in the sense that anyone can put content online but, in fact, commercial and advertising constraints mean that capitalism dictates who controls the available information. (Reminders of data as the "new oil") #CDHYoDA
1028 2018-12-06 22:14:37 So true
1029 2018-12-06 22:14:36 Based on my knowledge however oil does go through a process of leakage. But this is way over what it is suppose to be
1030 2018-12-06 22:14:28 Both sides of 'the science'?  Sadly, this indicates Trump has appointed yet another idiot. There is only 1 side to science, anything else isn't science, it's invention/fabrications big coal/big oil created to stop the world from realizing the degree of damage they've done
1031 2018-12-06 22:14:23 YOU NEED OIL MONEY 
TO ACTUALLY COMPETE
YOUR CLUBS FULL OF PLASTICS

1032 2018-12-06 22:13:45 Can’t wait for the next debacle, not being able to pay Forest Green the £1m there owed in January for Doidge. Not a chance they will see any of that. It’s gone on Ken’s tanning oil & his 100 tubs of brylcreem cream #bwfc
1033 2018-12-06 22:13:45 I’m not saying Keys was perfect but he did a hell of a lot more research than Malhotra! Malhotra went on a holiday for week to Pioppi and decided that coconut oil in coffee was great for your health. How many coconuts in Pioppi!? The Pioppi diet book is based on zero science.
1034 2018-12-06 22:13:41 I’m especially impressed by W’s dedication to improving his oil painting skills.

Also that quote at the inauguration (“that was some weird shit”) gave me confidence that I wasn’t insane...so there’s that 
1035 2018-12-06 22:13:34 I hope you advise your customers of the DPF and premature oil dilution problems as you are required to do under the Consumer protection from unfair trading regulations 2008! @TraceyLandRover @TataCompanies @TataMotors @JaguarUKPR @JLR_News @RNTata2000 @Emma_Lou_07 #pbbalaji2010
1036 2018-12-06 22:13:32 yeah sesame oil is extremely spicy on its own I learned that the hard way when I got it on my hand and tried to lick it off....
1037 2018-12-06 22:13:16 TIL that Jesus may have performed miracles with CBD oil
1038 2018-12-06 22:13:13 #WhenIWasAMuslim i used to think like that whenever i hear an #Exmuslim talk about islam. But then i realized these exmuslims have studied islam more than i have. for instance about how to wear a hijab properly for muslims 101.
1039 2018-12-06 22:13:07 Just please answer the question, ma'am. Did you want the synthetic oil or the regular for this oil change?
1040 2018-12-06 22:13:07 5th night is outta sight! Celebrating with dreidel contests and oil factory fun. #mymaimo
1041 2018-12-06 22:13:03 Do you have proof Obama stopped oil drilling?

Do you have proof Trump started oil drilling?

Do you understand economics at all?

How are you enjoying the job cuts in Ohio?
1042 2018-12-06 22:12:57 As an east coaster, I’m with you. But rain here isn’t like rain there. It’s closer to snow. The roads and infrastructure isn’t built for it. Long sitting oil make roads slick. Everything floods. People don’t know how to drive safe in it.
1043 2018-12-06 22:12:54 Every new battery cell manufactured reduces daily petroleum demand by 35 ml. Tesla currently manufactures 50/second. They'll be up to 2,000/second by 2023.

EVs reduce daily oil demand by 250,000 barrels already. 
The world needs many Gigafactories. Canada needs at least one.
1044 2018-12-06 22:12:51 Reimagineering #Honolulu, traffic: electric cars to be sold to folks who can verify that their solar panel system will be the main source for power. Anyone know how many barrels of oil are needed to give an e-car a fill-up? (I know depends on the make, etc)
1045 2018-12-06 22:12:51 She is selling snake oil.
1046 2018-12-06 22:12:43 Well said, @TheJuanWilliams. Leaving a legacy of love and good will is what made him a wealthy man, not the oil and money, but family. #Thefive
1047 2018-12-06 22:12:43 Bet it's painful.

Sandy, why don't you try some Vitamin E oil on the sting and/or Castor oil. Put some on gauze and tape it in place. 
Use it at night when you are sleeping and cover your foot with a stocking.

Both are very healing home remedies.
1048 2018-12-06 22:12:42 Nooooooooooo let them stay there
1049 2018-12-06 22:12:24 Time to oil
1050 2018-12-06 22:12:16 Come see us at @NorthGAspeedway for the Lucas Oil show.  That’s any mans race!
1051 2018-12-06 22:12:15 I Vaped CBD oil a while back.
1052 2018-12-06 22:12:11 If we quit buying Saudi Oil - the glut produced will likely cause steady to lower prices
1053 2018-12-06 22:12:03 Kip, I'm seriously interested in your take on Obama recently bragging about making USA the biggest oil producing country.
1054 2018-12-06 22:12:01 My skin is so greasy that oil companies could stop ocean drilling if they took advantage of this natural resource
1055 2018-12-06 22:11:51 いやだってなんか、男が競い合ってるのを女が投票で優劣を決めるのとか、思いっきり女尊男卑の匕プ世界の社会構造そのままだし……
1056 2018-12-06 22:11:48 Are you referring to Bernie Sanders? Since he has donations from Big Oil too. Did you check him on OpenSecrets?
1057 2018-12-06 22:11:40 It’s a lot to give up, but in order to make the salaries work this is sorta how a deal would need to be structured. Talbot/Simmonds cancels out (even leans to Phi advantage), Kassian/Neuvirth equal and need to add a pick so they take Wideman (for salary). Oil have an extra 3rd
1058 2018-12-06 22:11:33 Just got a oil change ready to go home and lay down 
1059 2018-12-06 22:11:28 Same loons that told us decades ago we'd reach peak oil by now and be freezing in the dark while fighting WW3 over it.  The world will keep on spinning long after we're all gone, let the dirty Third World shitholes clean up to our standard before burdening me any more !
1060 2018-12-06 22:11:25 Do not trust @yuleryan I asked him what a light on my dashboard meant and he was trying to get me to buy 60 pound oil when all I had to do was rev my engine for a few minutes
1061 2018-12-06 22:11:15 We No Longer NEED Saudi Oil - That excuse is pure Bull Shit
1062 2018-12-06 22:11:07 just scheduled my oil change appointment 
1063 2018-12-06 22:11:01 Went shopping today and came across numerous "keto coffee" and "keto protein" products.

Seems that adding a few grams of powdered oil to products justifies paying 2 or 3x the price? 

Keto seems more commercial than paleo ever was now.
1064 2018-12-06 22:10:55 Everything reeks of Tea Tree Oil. 

1065 2018-12-06 22:10:49 A friend of mine knows a former NDP Alberta politician, who says that Notley was fine when first elected, but is now owned by Big Oil, same as every other Alberta premier.
1066 2018-12-06 22:10:48 Yes... tell them that we need support for Canadian owned refineries/upgraders and EE. Canada needs to be energy self sufficient. Why is 100% of Ontario's oil provided by the USA?

1068 2018-12-06 22:10:36 I don’t have superior knowledge. Oil is priced similar to other commodities like aluminum, lithium and iron. Buyers and sellers agree to buy at a price.  It changes based on a lot of factors but expected demand and expected supply are key factors.
1069 2018-12-06 22:10:35 The feedstock of petroleum refineries is called crude oil. Feel like I have to explain everything here
1070 2018-12-06 22:10:33 Oof. Been there recently. Finely ground oatmeal and and coconut oil or plain yogurt helped a lot.
1071 2018-12-06 22:10:27 "there's virtually zero difference between Beto raising a few hundred k from people who work at oil companies and this [link to ro khanna taking hedge fund money]" this is what I took issue with. Apologies if I don't equivocate between the end of civilization and... anything.
1072 2018-12-06 22:10:22 Oil sector reform: I’m ready to sign PIGB, says Bu
1073 2018-12-06 22:10:19 (*｀ω´*)ﾄﾞﾔｱｱ
1074 2018-12-06 22:10:12 The Conservatives should try to stop being the party of the oil industry. It isn't a very popular niche. The reduction of the oil production is not a bad thing. If you don't believe it, compare the disaster in Britain versus the economic miracle in Norway.
1075 2018-12-06 22:10:10 Full spectrum cannabis is what I recommend. 
I personally use FECO(Full Extract Cannabis Oil)
It relieves symptoms as it heals. Remember the largest system of receptors in the human body is the endocannabinoid system.  We were literally created to benefit from Cannabis. 
1076 2018-12-06 22:10:07 Remember  grandma recommending Castor Oil for everything, well she was on to something   Many of the benefits of Caster Oil come from a particular type of fatty acid called “ricinoleic acid”  it also has strong immune enhancing effects by supporting the body’s lymphatic system
1077 2018-12-06 22:10:05 And what would you like Trudeau to do regarding the price of oil? 
1078 2018-12-06 22:10:03 バターとかマーガリンとか知らないけど多分吸ったぜ。
1079 2018-12-06 22:10:00 #FaithFriday    Exodus 40:9  @ApostleMMWangui
“Then you shall take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and all that is in it, and consecrate it and all its furniture, so that it may become holy.  @TheEastDoveTV
1080 2018-12-06 22:09:53 "Remember don't forget to use our RAMington oil to lube up, nothing worse than than having a bullet stuck in the chamber"
1081 2018-12-06 22:09:45 It's relevant in a Scottish context too. Sturgeon's approach to climate change is exactly like Trudeau's -- claim to be a climate leader while refusing to break with the oil industry.
1082 2018-12-06 22:09:24 Me as a human being: Gas is under $2/gal? Nice.

Me as an engineer in the oil industry: Gas is under $2/gal? FUCK FUCK FUCK
1083 2018-12-06 22:09:11 WHO IS GOING TO GO AFTER THEM? OIL SPILLS INCLUDED!!
1084 2018-12-06 22:09:03 The better half has asked for an oil diffuser for christmas. 

Remember this, when you're hauranging me in future for not being romantic or spontaneous enough. Yea?
1085 2018-12-06 22:08:52 #WhenIWasAMuslim i used to be like that too oh brother oil sheikh. i go from 0 to 100 within 299792458 m/s, when i see an #Exmuslim talk about islam. It's good that you can reflect on yourself and realize these things instead of going jihad. it's a beginning.
1086 2018-12-06 22:08:44 Castor oil truly is the worst thing on earth.  Just thinking about the taste makes me shudder.
1087 2018-12-06 22:08:43 Bush family does something with there oil stock what is the difference
1088 2018-12-06 22:08:42 Okay. That plus chocolate covers most of what I eat too. But you need olive oil and garlic and salt and pepper just as basic food preparation ingredients. Without that how would you prepare the cauliflower or the protein?
1089 2018-12-06 22:08:32 #MSNBC #MTPDaily Hey Donald Trump you don’t seem to realize that Saudi Arabia need our money they need money for oil if they don’t have money they have no revenue so don’t try to threaten us with that bull crap
1090 2018-12-06 22:08:31 Peppermint and lavender oil mixed in some "carrier oil" (I just use olive oil) on the temples and the back of the neck/shoulders. A little essential oil goes a long way so go easy at first till you know how it feels. Also put a little under the nose if you can.
1091 2018-12-06 22:08:29 It’s Bring Your Coconut Oil in the Shower With You Season
1092 2018-12-06 22:08:28 butter is just milk oil
1093 2018-12-06 22:08:27 Yes... oil and Armageddon.

1095 2018-12-06 22:08:09 Oh, and they take that oil from federal land.. which is actually SOCIALISM!! Just not for the middle class/poor... it's just reserved for the elite and politicians, shhhhhh! Don't tell anyone.

Oh, and they still pay 1920 prices to rent the land, not even accounting for inflation
1096 2018-12-06 22:08:06 Have you looked at taking cannabis oil? Forgive me if I appear intrusive. I really wish you well 
1097 2018-12-06 22:07:51 House of Lube does my oil cganges because I am 12. And they seem to do them well enough.
1098 2018-12-06 22:07:44 No Decision mean oil at 45
1099 2018-12-06 22:07:41 What the hell does any of this have to do with the government?  Get the politics and bureaucracy out of the way, let the industry build the pipeline capacity we need and quit the foolishness of putting all this oil in railcars!
1100 2018-12-06 22:07:36 Also they are fried in peanut oil
1101 2018-12-06 22:07:33 If it took the death of a Western citizen [Khashoggi] for us to be even slightly pissed off at a Gulf State, we have severe moral flaws. What they do to their own citizens is enough to warrant 10x the outrage. Oil/strategic interest shouldn't come before lives. #EscapeFromDubai
1102 2018-12-06 22:07:21 This had better not be used for coal, oil, and natural gas trains. You will pay for that at the polls if it is.
1103 2018-12-06 22:06:58 Man seh the oil ina him back 
1104 2018-12-06 22:06:56 Because I love Football, Boxing, Bottles of Corona & Sex but I’m $hit at Parking, Driving & I talk a lot am Ditzy, love shopping & don’t leave Xmas Shopping till Xmas Eve so I’m def a Girl!

1106 2018-12-06 22:06:50 Next thing you know they'll come for our lamp oil.
1107 2018-12-06 22:06:50 The Betty Crocker Devils Foodcake packet mix is fairly foolproof. You just add some veg oil, water and eggs.
1108 2018-12-06 22:06:46 So can we clearly show that we could sell AB crude if those pipelines are there.

Where is the market?

We seem2b heading into recession n there is already a lot of oil n gas slushing about.. n climate mandates coming on line eg Marine fuel regulations n vehicle electrification
1109 2018-12-06 22:06:27 Atta-boy Dougy! You got OPEC to drop oil prices and Trump to do your bidding. You gotta make Canada do what you want and appoint your friend to highly paid positions, whether they deserve it or not. Screw everybody else. Rise for Ford and Friends!
1110 2018-12-06 22:06:18 The original point is that the presence of oil and gas company employees to Beto ranging from big wealthy contributors to small not wealthy contributors says very little given his huge donor list. You will be likewise disappointed in even Bernie’s donor list.
1111 2018-12-06 22:06:14 Superb they look great, Holstein and kiez pizza meals, see you then oil buzzing
1112 2018-12-06 22:06:12 Also another big problem with the oil up here was the tech for the access. Uk was not able to get to it without others helping. Well I say help as in UK paying them billions a year for fuck all.
1113 2018-12-06 22:06:10 Essential oil diffuser
1114 2018-12-06 22:06:06 Not to mention building/maintaining roads for them, funding Coast Guards and the EPA to clean up oil spills, and cleaning up abandoned sites..... but as long as lobbying can continue for our politicians, who cares right?
1115 2018-12-06 22:05:57 Ocean filled with plastic. Oil & other chemicals used to make plastic, etc. I’m not just focused on carbon emissions, I’d like to prevent this plan let from becoming a shit hole & protect the air. I’m a crazy multi tasker like that
1116 2018-12-06 22:05:55 Lol I was thinking that but for £4.50 it's worth a try if you're using coconut oil, people are raving about this for things like ezema, so might help keep the disease nice and soft lol.
1117 2018-12-06 22:05:54 Exactly how is pumping more oil, burning more coal or putting more SUV's on the road (all conventional measures of GDP) going to help cool down the climate crisis?
1118 2018-12-06 22:05:51 Yes! I mean it was something more than a human conspiracy (though that very likely did happen)-- I mean structurally/historically, something like this was virtually inevitable. Big Oil/Gas is just too gargantuan to simply fade away. It's a historical crisis.
1119 2018-12-06 22:05:51 You do not have a problem lol. I use coconut oil and tea tree oil for everything. The other day I noticed a little bad spot in my hairline and I freaked out and I put tea tree oil and when I checked again little hairs were growing already lmaooo fix it Jesus 
1120 2018-12-06 22:05:46 Y’all niggaa change bitches more than y’all change the oil in ya musty ass cars
1121 2018-12-06 22:05:45 Pipelines are part of a dying industry.
Every new battery cell manufactured reduces daily petroleum demand by 35 ml. Tesla currently manufactures 50/second. They'll be up to 2,000/second by 2023.

EVs reduce daily oil demand by 250,000 barrels already. 
We need Gigafactories.

Do you realise we are heading for another recession

Do u realise the combination of a nationwide strike, the new minimum wage and OPEC affecting oil prices would mean recession

Do u realise that this socialism is beyond our means
1125 2018-12-06 22:05:42 Saudi Arabia and Russia “probably want to give the appearance that everyone’s opinion is important, especially after the Qatari decision to withdraw from OPEC,” Bob Ryan @ BCA Research. “They’d all be thrown into another deep recession, and oil capex would be destroyed globally.”

1129 2018-12-06 22:05:21 Electric vehicles still need tyres/plastics/lubricants.

Not using oil is a fantasy.
1130 2018-12-06 22:05:18 just lol at that woman selling  blue pilled snake oil!
1131 2018-12-06 22:05:09 Take it back and let them know. You might have a oil leak. Check where you was park to see if you see any spots

I wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw him
1134 2018-12-06 22:04:48 @FreeLatifa I pray to God the beautiful Latifa is still alive. I hope UAE understands when their oil runs out....and it will... the country will crumble!!! The west will drop them like a hot potato.
1135 2018-12-06 22:04:47 Because we are the biggest users of Mid East oil.  Could really hurt them.  It was reported during Obama’s terms that we actually have more oil than the Saudis
1136 2018-12-06 22:04:45 Why olive oil always gotta be so damn expensive
1137 2018-12-06 22:04:44 الفتنه بلشت لما راح الحريري تاني مره على السعوديه انو ما شبع ذل اول مره رجع راح تاني مرة و بقول ان بكامل حريتي ،، ولكن ايمتا بدكم تكونو احرار في دنياكم ايمتا ؟ عن اي فتنه عم تحكي ما كل شي بدو ياه الحريري عم ينعملو و لو حزب الله بدو فتنه كان ما قبل بالحريري رايس لو اجا الكون كلو

1139 2018-12-06 22:04:38 I got the new Ipad Pro today, so that I can do the nearly-endless conceptual art needed for my IP. I used to be quite the oil painter, and stopped doing it because I didn't see it as a viable career. So now I am a writer resurrecting his artistic ability. I'm doing it wrong. 
1140 2018-12-06 22:04:26 Nononono. Olive oil is gross.
1141 2018-12-06 22:04:23 If we can tell that there is gold, salt, oil, diamonds, nickel in the ground we can also tell that atmospheric conditions producing particular types of sediments have to be within particular tolerances in a long term.
1142 2018-12-06 22:04:20 They only let you bring giant vats of burning hot oil and shovels, I think that second one will be their undoing
1143 2018-12-06 22:04:16 So where is the oil now. . . 
1144 2018-12-06 22:04:12 As an SNP member I agree with you Ross. The party has to abandon its oil habit. I’ll be writing more about this shortly.
1145 2018-12-06 22:04:11 When you go for an $30 oil change and the mechanic find a million other problems. 
1146 2018-12-06 22:04:08 Continuity? Then why didn't Ninu Zammit sign them? Just to make sure? 

By the way, why hasn't @Joe_Mizzi_ resigned yet? Wasn't he going to resign if we didn't find oil after 6 months?

Fool.
1147 2018-12-06 22:04:01 So here’s what I learnt about myself. Writing haiku and painting in watercolour helps me find calm, peace, my zen place. But when I am enraged, frenetically penning dark poems and splattering oil paints onto a canvas is much more cathartic.
1148 2018-12-06 22:03:55 PLEASE do not go down the secret oil fields route.

Remember, according to @AlexSalmond , oil was "only a bonus"

And, surely,, a green, carbon-free, Scotland, wouldn't look to profit from something'that could ruin the planet, could it..
1149 2018-12-06 22:03:55 There are other stranded assets like flare gas where mining is providing a benefit by eliminating a liability. @SGBarbour is working on that. We are working on making mining portable, liquid cooling dropping the PUE from 1.2 as cited to 1.06. Will see miners on oil rigs!

1152 2018-12-06 22:03:34 @SteveForbesCEO The gas and oil companies should have thier own solar and nat gas powered automation. PS Prez Bush 41 screwed out reelection in 1992 by Perot screwing up the election. Then he would have been prez when game changer Windows 95 was rolled out xmas 1994.

1155 2018-12-06 22:03:20 Economics, explained that net petroleum product exports of 4.227M bpd exceeded net oil imports of 4.016M bpd, leading to the figure on net exports. “We are still a net importer of crude oil but our net exports of products exceed the crude imports,” WTRG
1156 2018-12-06 22:03:10 This one NYE, Evangelist came to our village house to pray us into the New Year. After 4 hours of intense prayer, Evangelist brought out anointing oil saying it's time to bless the house.

1160 2018-12-06 22:02:45 So world your driving, using petroleum based products daily. And oil is bad?
No it's not, you are. Alberta and the rest of Canada is in a recession because of having a weak government. Trudeau and his green dream, overkill? Well he did kill the pipeline, temporarily. Stupid JT
1161 2018-12-06 22:02:44 Next up. The GOP plan to revive the whale oil industry.
1162 2018-12-06 22:02:43 Fact:

Big oil makes hundreds of billions in profit while people making $7.25 have to try and survive while living off of food stamps. Yet Republicans want to give them a huge tax break and get rid of those pesky food stamps. Your tax dollars pay for Big Oil subsidies (50 Mill)
1163 2018-12-06 22:02:42 So when will there be justice for Latifa in Dubai ? How long will world governments allow the UAE states and others , control, kidnap, suppress . Why do we accept this ? Oil ? Power ? Money? World Cup in Qatar . Is this really what a ‘ free’ western world wants moving forward ?

1167 2018-12-06 22:01:11 Building the brand right on the timeline gives me new ideas and it’s a form of accountability. 

Even if the oil isn’t in the pen itself, there has to be a way of “soaking” the lining of the box so that when the customer opens the box they are hit with the smell of success!

1176 2018-12-06 22:00:28 Great visit to Shell Rheinland, thanks for your hospitality and listening to me talk about oil storage mixers
1177 2018-12-06 22:00:28 BESIDES, oil prices are set globally! So even if the U.S. were to produce more oil, it is not like we can sell it for a higher price than the Saudis or Emiratis. It does not make sense to open up land for oil exploration. Especially not with climate change being so prevalent.
1178 2018-12-06 22:00:25 Maybe just put things in context and give facts out and then you won’t be seen as a political hit man.  You do a lot of good stuff, but the whole Beto takes oil and gas money thing smacked of cherry picking information to smear a possible opponent of Bernie.
1179 2018-12-06 22:00:15 Thank you, we like lots of traditional confectionery businesses are on a journey with palm oil.

1183 2018-12-06 22:00:10 Either way, none of the two is going to happen. The oil monopoly is less and less relevant.
1184 2018-12-06 22:00:08 I think my favorite thing of 2018 was when my mom posted a meme to our Oil Group on FB of Buzz Lightyear taking a dab and it said "a dab of oil a day is all I need" and she thought it was talking about Essential Oils.

1187 2018-12-06 21:59:41 Do people not know that Kuwait kept moving their border posts north to cover more and more of a supposedly shared oil field? An oil field that accounted for a large portion of the revenues for Iraq -- bankrupt by a war with Iran that the US supported...
1188 2018-12-06 21:59:34 I think my point flew over your head. 
1st) He never supported destiel in the oil rig fanfic. It was general fanfic, and he added on to what misha said. Is that the best you got?
2nd) Sure they're friendly with destiel. My question was: have they said it's a canon possibility?
1189 2018-12-06 21:59:28 My ex husband was better, he slapped me around but I could buy cooking oil. Now this new one, aah he slaps me around but I can't even buy cooking oil..cooking oil is the logic!
1190 2018-12-06 21:59:20 I don't remember anyone claiming he was a tool of the oil lobby
1191 2018-12-06 21:59:16 Fool in White House is in bed with Saudis - so his friends there tell him they will sell him cheap oil - and he does not understand - they have a reason - the Saudis MUST keep America from achieving 100% energy independence-
1192 2018-12-06 21:59:15 Please look into CBD oil, Gerson Therapy, Dr Morse herbs, Apricot Kernal Seeds as well as drinking lots of zam zam water and doing ruqya for shifaa in shaa Allaah. Hope this is somewhat of a help to your family!
1193 2018-12-06 21:58:56 More like 'Setting the record crooked'.

1 attack claimed Beto got oil money from corporations.
Wrong.
It was individuals, giving individually, they'd just cross-referenced & found some of the donors had jobs at oil cos.

By same standard, Bernie's a far bigger "corp shill".
1194 2018-12-06 21:58:54 Stealing our trees as well as our oil? Will it never end?
1195 2018-12-06 21:58:54 When I think #GeorgeBush I'll always remember 9/11 ...... I'll always remember all those drug companies Pharmaceuticals , did they used to line their pockets and kill people. Those oil companies they Murdered men, women and Children for....it's true all you gotta do is look it up
1196 2018-12-06 21:58:53 I recall the glory days when Alberta wanted nothing to do with Ottawa. Now that the price of oil has tanked Alberta is pissed that Ottawa isn’t bailing the Province out! Funny how things change......
1197 2018-12-06 21:58:50 And I'm not sure why. If they think Kenny would have brought them high oil prices and pipelines galore, they're deluding themselves.
1198 2018-12-06 21:58:49 WE DON'T NEED OIL. PERIOD
1199 2018-12-06 21:58:44 What about the nine million acres of land that are going to be used for oil exploration and mining. NINE MILLION ACRES OF LAND. the U.S. produced more oil in FY2017 than KSA. Oil exploration policies should not be at the forefront of American policy right now. It is a waste.
1200 2018-12-06 21:58:44 You now carry a u-turn 
1201 2018-12-06 21:58:39 I got an oil change without my dad reminding me.. IM GROWN

1203 2018-12-06 21:58:27 shifting frames here just a little, even given various centuries more of increasing economic growth, at some point it will be necessary to think of *concentrating* energy. synthetic oil will eventually be necessary.
1204 2018-12-06 21:58:22 You need to change your oil.
1205 2018-12-06 21:58:20 apprently rubbing castor oil helps
1206 2018-12-06 21:58:10 Depends how crispy you want it...I cooked for about 10 mins on low heat in a little oil...cook longer to get more crispy 
1207 2018-12-06 21:57:40 Moving in the right direction.  I just wish healthline wasn’t pushing that bit about vegetable oil being better than saturated fat.
1208 2018-12-06 21:56:58 Wlh, I came back from Ogun state n I was going back to d office, d driver was to deliver goods to d north, he dropped me at Berger...
1209 2018-12-06 21:56:55 Aren’t we energy independent? Natural gas, oil and nuclear power? The auto industry committed suicide by pricing cars above the middle class means. That will have to be rectified by auto makers. Meanwhile, all the Audi’s, BMWs, Mercedes and Range Rovers create a lot of traffic
1210 2018-12-06 21:56:54 he didn't need to occupy iraq. the first thing everyone wanted was iraqi oil but he knew if he touched it, THAT would be the catastrophe. so instead he just stole iraqi money by contracting the likes of halliburton and such with iraqi money...
1211 2018-12-06 21:56:49 Absolutely. I’m embarrassed to say that Harry has educated me these last couple of weeks about the orangutans and palm oil. Small steps = big changes. Keep up the good work @MrsSSmall
1212 2018-12-06 21:56:49 つえぇ
1213 2018-12-06 21:56:40 And all of my moms presents are Oil related 
1214 2018-12-06 21:56:33 The maintenance guy asked if I wanted him to oil my seat .... 
I was professional and said oh no, it's ok, the sqeakiness doesn't even bother me anymore been so long ... 
I'm so unaware ... smh ...
1215 2018-12-06 21:56:32 The only thing he’s missing is an oil stained Carhartt
1216 2018-12-06 21:56:30 Fully agree! He was too week to take Iraq’s oil! Not like trump!
1217 2018-12-06 21:56:29 The oil I have in mine is Sudanese frankincense and myrrh....exotic, rich, earthy, grounding
I can't wait to see what you do....I'd love to help with some scent suggestions...(I retail oils and inscence) and affirmations #buildingbiz
1218 2018-12-06 21:56:25 Yes.  BUT it’s time for the oil industry to take a stand.   That they sit idly by while others do the heavy lifting is frankly, sickening.
1219 2018-12-06 21:56:17 An oil drum for catching rainwater...Ack!  A sparrow just flew over and... Aw man, that was just disgusting!
1220 2018-12-06 21:56:16 Mr Kenny is making exaggerated statements which have to potential to frighten many who work in the oil sector.  Politician should avoid hyperbole.
1221 2018-12-06 21:55:59 Big oil is considered “Special Intetest”. Don’t expect them to get on board
1222 2018-12-06 21:55:52 I just got my oil changed like 4 weeks ago 
1223 2018-12-06 21:55:52 I thought that was sesame oil
1224 2018-12-06 21:55:52 I don't see how oil/gas has "obfuscated" the truth. That's just a conspiracy theory.
1225 2018-12-06 21:55:48 No hun just using my Shea and cocoa butter mix I did put a few drops of almond oil and palmers vitamin e oil in the mix but if I was allergic to any of those ingredients I would have noticed straight away I presume rather then three weeks later
1226 2018-12-06 21:55:40 Including your toothbrushes, plastic car dashboard facings & dials.   And how did you drive your car today?  Oh yes, oil & gas.  Everything that is manufactured today in our comfortable civilization is based in fossil fuels.
1227 2018-12-06 21:55:31 .#Bloomberg News is obsessed with #OPEC and oil production...
1228 2018-12-06 21:55:26 It really do be like that
1229 2018-12-06 21:55:19 Would Ei last until Trudeau globalist cronies tell him the real plan? They know in the dirty 30s that people would work for food so there's that.
 The irregulars will be OK working in government pot plantations for a living wage while the state plays with your oil..
1230 2018-12-06 21:55:18 Got your cooking oil ready?

Also, apple sauce or sour cream?
1231 2018-12-06 21:55:10 เรียกจิกคนอื่นอีแบบนี้ดูไม่มีการศึกษาเลยค่ะ
1232 2018-12-06 21:55:06 Yes but it can mean producing more oiL, using less or both
1233 2018-12-06 21:55:03 Leaving Scottish oil in the ground just means we'd have to get it from somewhere else, because right now there's no practical alternative.
As alternatives are developed, demand for oil will fall and it'll stay in the ground by default.
1234 2018-12-06 21:54:46 Oil pressure-It can indicate a low oil level. You might want to get the oil checked ASAP.
1235 2018-12-06 21:54:24 Thanks for the question, Mattie. All travelers must comply with federal law on transporting cannabis infused products, such as CBD oil, on board a flight. Our officers are required to notify law enforcement officers when they discover these products while screening property.
1236 2018-12-06 21:54:22 Harper’s legacy of failure continues to haunt Alberta.  Harper had 9 years in office and could not build a single pipe line to the West Coast freeing AB oil. That level of incompetence is hard to fathom. It is really too bad for Alberta that Harper was a bloviator not a builder
1237 2018-12-06 21:54:12 Just tell him there's oil in that thar saucepan and he'll stick his head straight in. Nah, who am I kidding, he'll send someone else to do it then talk about it with the Saudis. For a £1million of course
1238 2018-12-06 21:54:06 Most of that is probably a standard disclaimer, but he's definitely a diet-pill selling snake oil salesman
1239 2018-12-06 21:53:54 cheaper alternatives? Oil sands oil is produced at around $30/bbl. how would a pipeline drive the price of Canada's oil down further? The issue is one of takeaway capacity and a pipeline would actually significantly increase the price of Canadian oil
1240 2018-12-06 21:53:53 Nope...it is mechanicus standard grey, nuln oil recess wash and then ministorum grey edge highlight.

1242 2018-12-06 21:53:43 Yeah right. That's what U wanted long before U were installed in the WH - the OIL, for U & 4 Pooty. I heard U say it in an interview "I would have kept the oil". No doubt in my mind U R a greedy SOB.
1243 2018-12-06 21:53:35 Saturday need to get here so i can get my oil change.
1244 2018-12-06 21:53:22 Who & what, exactly, is "big oil??"  Without oil for your furnaces, you & your ancestors would have frozen to death in your harsh Maine winters.  Plastics, used in hospitals for IV bags & tubing, disposable needles, laytex  gloves & antiseptic dispensers, are all made from oil
1245 2018-12-06 21:53:08 I just received the foundation and i tried it on three times with the oil, without the oil and my usual primer and ugh my skin doesn’t like it. i want to like it so bad but it won’t blend and it’s tacky.. is it just me omfg
1246 2018-12-06 21:53:07 You do that! As will I. Happy to start eating ldl cholesterol meat,fish,eggs,coconut oil etc if the science supports it. Unfortunately it doesn’t and Aseem although right about processed foods is not right about his take on the Pioppi diet and his  assassination of Keys work.
1247 2018-12-06 21:53:06 Oil companies won’t like this. We must come up with a biodegradable alternative to plastic!!
1248 2018-12-06 21:52:50 I couldn't care less about govt expansion. There are no other bodies which can mobilise the resources necessary to deal with this threat. But the fact that it barely registers as an electoral issue in the US shows how well oil/gas interests have obfuscated the issue.
1249 2018-12-06 21:52:45 If your boss is an asshole just splash a little coconut oil on him. Coconut oil solves everything.
1250 2018-12-06 21:52:41 I came for an oil change and ended up paying an additional $67 for new filters

1255 2018-12-06 21:52:26 Did I mention oil barrons? I said it's bullshit because the predictions were proven wrong within a mere two decades of issue, nothing unusual is happening to the climate, and carbon is a trace gas which happens to be a shit greenhouse agent

1264 2018-12-06 21:51:34 Random question, but @Fritolay - Why do your baked chips cost more and come with less than your regular chips? You don’t have to use oil to fry them (so they should be cheaper) and if a product is healthier, you should get at least as much as the unhealthier product in a bag.
1265 2018-12-06 21:51:31 It’s just so annoying because I don’t smoke weed and probably won’t try it but I am going to try out CBD oil. I want to see more studies but the reason why there aren’t many yet is because it takes years to get approval to study

1270 2018-12-06 21:51:07 The oil apologists always try the canard "why do you travel/ heat your home"? Just keep repeating, fuel efficiency standards, as the easiest most immediate solution. Every year they make bigger cars w/more horsepower, that waste gas. Don't let them frame the argument.

1279 2018-12-06 21:50:31 We need a new oil dispenser. But, the reviews aren’t great on the @vremiofficial dispenser I have my eye on. Better reviews, but we don’t need the dual set! Why do I get sucked into the amazon review abyss?!?
1280 2018-12-06 21:50:29 Here. Is it fair to say that Thatcher essentially spunked North Sea oil revenue on paying to keep the fallout from her 1980s economic policy harming more than it did?
1281 2018-12-06 21:50:26 Those are the same people that didn't think they would need oil changes on hybrid vehicle....
1282 2018-12-06 21:50:25 Reality begs to differ here: while 'oil' is one of #Saudi strongest suit, it's not the only one. :)
1283 2018-12-06 21:50:23 I can understand not having a cast iron skillet, but no olive oil or garlic? :)
1284 2018-12-06 21:50:22 I get organic coconut oil. Supposed to be good moisturizer too and has no flavour when you’re... you know. 
1285 2018-12-06 21:50:09 I grew up in LubbockTexas with two Irish immigrant parents. My dad loved trains. We used to just take really long rides. I remember everytime we passed a Santafe oil rig we’d all yell yatahee to Santafe. I don’t know what it meant but it was a family thing
1286 2018-12-06 21:50:08 Whether oil is non-renewable or not. I’ve been hearing theories about how the government covers up the fact that we have a never ending amount of oil. That it’s essentially like the Earth’s “blood”. That way the govt. can keep raising the prices. Big Sean has a song about it.
1287 2018-12-06 21:50:02 He "played" for the Flames.  He didn't "work" for them.  My only point.  He has a social justice issue to fight for -- then he joins a party that makes light of people who fight those battles, i.e., SJWs.  His comments on economics and oil prices are blind Harperism.
1288 2018-12-06 21:49:55 Congratulation, I still have some brent oil calls (minus 5%) and today I was filled with my limit on #DJIA (+5%) because I was outside playing the Nicholas for little children of friend .... Tomorrow will be an exciting weekending's close ....

1290 2018-12-06 21:49:42 Nope, This is abt trade, oil and ultimately wages.  Since Nov the interest rate was expected to go up & it wouldn't contribute to this kind of instability.

1292 2018-12-06 21:49:27 Today I did a very hilarious thing at 7up bust stop, motorways, I don't even know what I was thinking of. I used my leg to go pass a U-turn while trekking, instead of me to walk straight.
I forgot I wasn't In a car
1293 2018-12-06 21:49:26 So you’re saying a candidate from an oil state is the right guy to deal with climate change?

1300 2018-12-06 21:48:42 Actually renewables like geothermal need a level playing field with fossil fuels and big oil!!! And if coal has already been all but ended, why bring it back now when we have moved on.
1301 2018-12-06 21:48:41 No oil drilling in the arctic refugee it was written in today’s New York Times
1302 2018-12-06 21:48:37 Where's the Outrage from the US. Taxpayer, why is our Military still parked in the Middle East if we don't have to protect the oilfields ? It was never there to protect the oil, it was there to fight Israel's wars !!!!!
1303 2018-12-06 21:48:35 that state doesn't necessarily mean that there is a "cabal" directing those contributions--which Mr. Sirota's posts yesterday and today seem to imply.  There are MANY people in TX employed in oil and gas.  They have to disclose who they work for.  /2 end
1304 2018-12-06 21:48:32 It’s okay guys we will all polish our title belts in the meantime but after we oil our hair.
1305 2018-12-06 21:48:31 And who has the most oil ? The Arab countries and what religion are they ? They ?
1306 2018-12-06 21:48:30 Wrong! I just did. Gotteem
1307 2018-12-06 21:48:29 Pipelines are the safest and most economical means to transport oil.  But humans operate and maintain them.  Oil is the precursor to the chemical industry that manufactures consumer products from Viagra to the Aspirin for the Headache

1310 2018-12-06 21:48:08 Hai-Lai! Remember you need a oil change and tune-up. Have your levels been checked recently? 
1311 2018-12-06 21:48:07 Mum the hemp oil shouldn't be dissolving the salad for fucks sake

1313 2018-12-06 21:47:47 Been there twice its surreal seeing parts of the ships and oil in the water
1314 2018-12-06 21:47:44 @realDonaldTrump the government of President Trump can do this great work by April, and this must be done. Freedom of our people only depends on the full boycott of oil, I expect your government to be strong and realize this great goal.
1315 2018-12-06 21:47:43 Why does everyone love & respect #GHWB  now he's dead? They media hated him when he was alive. Everyone blamed him for war & oil prices. I don't remember many people actually respecting him or his family. Kind of odd 
1316 2018-12-06 21:47:38 Sure, but don’t you get the impression that oil runs deeper in Scotland than merely pandering to capital? Or is that all it is?
1317 2018-12-06 21:47:35 USA is now a net exporter of oil, the first time since 1973. AND a massive new reserve was found in West Texas and announced today.
1318 2018-12-06 21:47:27 30 minutes you think Steve? I'd check at 20, especially if you added oil.
1319 2018-12-06 21:47:21 It’s not happening. We have plenty of oil. You just want us to believe it’s okay for you to back the murdering Saudi prince. Liar!
1320 2018-12-06 21:47:16 Chef Gusteau cut up some potatoes, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was an old shoe brush, along with cheese.

1322 2018-12-06 21:46:58 Racist?!? Oil has... race ?!?! Oohhhh... I see, you’re one of “those”... No, I didn’t mean to WIN anything. You, on the other hand, just lost it with this last one of yours... Guess you should’ve sticked with 1 line sentences, lol... Farewell then!

1325 2018-12-06 21:46:51 REALITY CHECK

Be aware that when Al Gore was Vice President, he had his own CLIMATE CHANGE MEETING at the White House Garden, where i attended as an NGO  of my
 OIL ALTERNATIVE AQUAHOL.

HE NEVER HELPED GET IT IMPLEMENTED even though we DOUBLED the fuel mileage on a police car.

1327 2018-12-06 21:46:47 Went to the market today
One small boy used his wheelbarrow to push one pastor preaching in the market
The pastor just shouted "don't let me destroy don't let me break your head stupid boy"
This pastor was even holding anointing oil and one big bible
1328 2018-12-06 21:46:47 I blow dry my hair straight and then pass with the straighteners once. Use a serum and then a dry oil for fly always. I use chi silk infusion, I get it on amazon

1330 2018-12-06 21:46:42 Great news; glad to hear we're "energy-independent"!
I expect we'll hear from Trump that he has told his desert friends to pump their oil up their noses, yes? And he'll stop shitting his pants over price increases, yes?
I'll spread the good news; saying I heard it from Prager!
1331 2018-12-06 21:46:41 @realDonaldTrump I hope that the men and women who are dignified will unite and finish the work of this damaging oil of the Iranian regime, the work of the Iranian oil will end,

1336 2018-12-06 21:46:17 I hate waiting to get oil changes
1337 2018-12-06 21:46:12 Maybe for some nation's but not for . By the way I still haven't heard when China, Saudi Arabia are taking on migrants. I still think this is about robbing the middle East of oil & Africa of diamonds & minerals,maybe S. America too under faux global warming pyramid scheme. 
1338 2018-12-06 21:46:05 and cuz the coconut oil is solid when it settles, you just add a tiny bit of warm water to the mason jar while in the shower, mix it with your finger, and it's easily scoopable.
1339 2018-12-06 21:45:59 Idk why but I feel like me and @TomiLahren would be really pretty lesbians together and we could totally turn on blue collar America on a poster of us making out topless in oil 
1340 2018-12-06 21:45:56 You sure can and probably should! But oil interests are extra evil.

1345 2018-12-06 21:45:34 Proves that all that talk "We have to be in the Middle East"cause we need the oil was all bullshit to keep our Military there to keep fighting Israel's wars !!!!!

1351 2018-12-06 21:44:57 Laugh all you want but Sarah Palin was right. “Drill baby drill!” has led the United States to become a net oil exporter for the first time in 75 years
1352 2018-12-06 21:44:45 Now Modi should be prosecuted as he made back door discussions to change the oil prices.
1353 2018-12-06 21:44:44 @realDonaldTrump must show that the zeal of the Arabs does not allow them to accuse them of the capitalist bourgeoisie and must stand with all their power against these oppressors; only the complete replacement of Iranian oil can be the answer Tooth decay to them
1354 2018-12-06 21:44:44 They are like oil and water.  Don't mix, no matter how they try to dress it up.
1355 2018-12-06 21:44:39 No offense but NB has the population of Mississauga so if LeBlanc walked out it would piss off 3 or 4 postal codes. Meh!  If JT cared about the economy he'd realize oil is somewhat of a necessary evil for Canada.
1356 2018-12-06 21:44:36 Raw Coconut Oil was life changing. It smells good, doesn’t absorb super fast either. Highly recommend.

1359 2018-12-06 21:44:26 Oh sure. Let's export all our surplus oil & LNG. What are we ever going to need it for? Let's get rid of all our surplus foods too. We never have natural disasters, bizzards, floods, droughts or fires. Why would Americans ever need anything for that ephemeral  rainy day?
1360 2018-12-06 21:44:25 The Trump @EPA has purged from EPA's website a webpage summarizing the health benefits of its Mercury & Air Toxics Standards for Power Plants that burn coal & oil.

This is a precursor to a December rollback, which will deny these safeguards deliver health benefits.

1361 2018-12-06 21:44:16 Started using my CBD oil droplets today
1362 2018-12-06 21:43:58 Great point.. Canada gov also just bought a pipeline from a private company to transport oil - there will always be a gov hand- it's the how much & in what capacity that we have to figure it out - so government wouldn't become the 'judge, jury & executioner'

1364 2018-12-06 21:43:37 Amazon has its own brand of motor oil. That's where we are as a society.
1365 2018-12-06 21:43:35 “Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted. The world does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices!” Trump wrote in a tweet on Wednesday.
1366 2018-12-06 21:43:28 @realDonaldTrump there is only one way and the complete abolition of Iranian oil exports. Everyone needs to unite in order to be able to do so until April, must stand all the way to the capitalist system, greet the zeal of the French people who stood against the capitalist system
1367 2018-12-06 21:43:20 We The People are awake. It’s the Oil Cartel that is holding us down.
1368 2018-12-06 21:43:18 I get a boner every time I see an oil derrick because I'm turned on by money.
1369 2018-12-06 21:43:16 Iranian exports have plummeted after the United States imposed fresh sanctions on Tehran in November. But Washington gave sanctions waivers to some buyers of Iranian crude, further raising fears of an oil glut next year.
1370 2018-12-06 21:43:13 I go through moments of hope & despair. When supposed environmental groups praise a president who increased global wars & oil & gas production in US, but then you look at all the people waking up. Not just young people, but people I know in their mid-sixties are getting involved.

1373 2018-12-06 21:42:49 @realDonaldTrump I ask the American people to be careful and lazy See the lines. We need the support of the American people and all liberals, so that Iran's oil exports are completely cut off, if only you want to help the people suffer,
1374 2018-12-06 21:42:45 パンさんおはごですー！
1375 2018-12-06 21:42:45 And my other point is that this oil money thing is turning into like a reverse straw man we inflicted on ourselves, or a false target. It’s too easy to argue over to no avail, like we’re doing right now, when there are other more meaningful points to be made.
1376 2018-12-06 21:42:43 hardly trying to clear the progressive field, more like trying to define what a progressive candidate is & if they will fight for us.

centrists can run as centrists, progressives should clearly stand for progressive ideals and being in the pocket of AIPAC or big oil isn't it.
1377 2018-12-06 21:42:35 Just when you thought Zinke and Trump reached  the zenith of their gross bout of ideological incest with the oil & gas industry, this Administration of science illiterate stooges is proposing opening more of the already minimal conserved habitat for Greater Sage-grouse.
1378 2018-12-06 21:42:35 That's a deep question. I think it's really what climate change has been about for over 20 years. Not oil companies (though they're bad), not energy, not wealth per se, but how we arrange our social relations; essentially, the social contract, which has gone missing.
1379 2018-12-06 21:42:35 Energy independence comes from renewable solar energy, not digging holes for oil and shale and fracking the crap out of the earth. @WSJ get on board with  technology and science @Ocasio2018
1380 2018-12-06 21:42:28 Which is strange because Big Oil believes and knew about climate change for 40 years.
1381 2018-12-06 21:42:24 Just remember low gas prices mean oil field workers, refinery crews, etc all here in the US also cut back on staff so no low gas prices don’t benefit everyone. As for why no one is griping now I couldn’t tell you cuz the stock market at least regarding my retirement $ has tanked
1382 2018-12-06 21:42:21 I don’t think if he was there during the Obama years it would have been such an echo chamber to be fair to @jonathanvswan though, but yes that kind of attitude would have been nice from a couple reporters

1388 2018-12-06 21:42:07 My lovely Brazilian friends used to make me a garlic spaghetti dish. It's literally just a handful of garlic cloves chopped up slightly (not too small) and fried in oil until just about to brown and then the spaghetti is tossed in. Amazing! (Awful for other ppl the next day!)
1389 2018-12-06 21:42:04 best guess on why the transports have been pummeled with oil going down and the holiday season in full swing?
1390 2018-12-06 21:42:02 Whoever is following the Khassoggi  story( The journalist that was murdered by the Saudis) would understand that America can not f*ck with Saudi Arabia partly 'cos of their oil money. This makes me weep for Nigeria, we have this resources and our influence is so minute.

1405 2018-12-06 21:40:33 @realDonaldTrump I swear that if Iran's oil is completely cut off by April, the biggest enemy of the United States and the greatest enemy of humanity, the Iranian regime, will collapse; everyone knows that the key to this change in Iran is just a total boycott of Iranian oil.
1406 2018-12-06 21:40:30 You can do it in a cast iron skillet. Add some garlic, balsamic vinegar and olive oil and you're done.

1409 2018-12-06 21:40:20 Do you see what the Fed & their collusive friends in the US Treasury just did. They slaughtered oil because the economy is in deep trouble then told people they may quit raising rates because inflation pressures have abated. If you are an oil producer you are collateral damage.
1410 2018-12-06 21:40:18 The Missing Princess (Latifa) doc on BBC again raises serious concerns about the control, power and abuses carried out across the Middle East. It seems that oil, arms and money can buy anything including human rights immunity. Who will be brave enought to say no more?
1411 2018-12-06 21:40:16 Yes Dick, it’s the Norwegian Wind Energy Association or Norwegian Energy Partners who cover renewables and oil and gas
1412 2018-12-06 21:40:15 Low-cost and available to the public is far more important if your goal is to reduce oil dependence. Teslas, for example, are still a luxury brand that most cannot afford, and cannot make a big enough dent in the percentage of vehicles out there.

1415 2018-12-06 21:40:09 Now, lemme clarify something else: I think Beto is a decent candidate, but like the others, he's not 100% (and neither is Bernie himself, really). I have criticisms of Beto, but one of them isn't that he takes corporate money from Big Oil.

1417 2018-12-06 21:40:07 Honestly, we don't know the details of the situation. If Canada is building oil pipelines through reservations & on sacred land & totally blowing off any concerns of contaminated drinking water like the U. S. has done to Native Americans, then she has every right to be furious.

1427 2018-12-06 21:39:29 That’s good it means it is working. It is like my Land Rover: if it isn’t leaking oil, don’t bother starting it because it means there’s none in it. And in this case here is if it isn’t noisy and steaming hot, laptop isn’t working... 
1428 2018-12-06 21:39:16 Oil prices have crashed as Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United Arab Emirates raised output since June after Trump called for higher production to offset lower exports from Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer.
1429 2018-12-06 21:39:13 Oh Michelle, how lovingly patronizing of you. And I'm sure you have a lot of experience in middle eastern geopolitics and understand the British oil company expansions in that region.

1440 2018-12-06 21:38:05 Econ majors have a tough time believing the world is not close to what they were taught in school. Major markets are not purely command and control, but when the 2 most important prices in our economy (money and oil) are determined by a cartel, there's a lot of room for freedom.

1442 2018-12-06 21:38:00 The oilsands are a dead industry because of cheaper alternatives. I hope the Liberals don't throw my money away building a pipeline that will just drive down the price of Alberta oil further. Let's try making economic sense Andrew.

1444 2018-12-06 21:37:49 Continued investment in the oil industry will remove any incentive to work towards sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels. Not everyone will see eye to eye on this issue, but we believe that our government needs to develop strategies to move us to renewable energy.

1449 2018-12-06 21:37:25 Oil of oregano shot. It’ll knock it straight out.
1450 2018-12-06 21:37:24 Would I like to get my hair cut while getting my oil changed? Yes. 

Is shark tank TV so crying children exciting? Also yes.
1451 2018-12-06 21:37:21 Anchovies & chilli, and olive oil...nothing else except cheese. Delicious XX
1452 2018-12-06 21:37:17 Please where can I get pure jojoba oil?
1453 2018-12-06 21:37:11 The price of crude has fallen almost a third since October but U.S. President Donald Trump has demanded the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries make oil even cheaper by refraining from output cuts.
1454 2018-12-06 21:36:58 CONTEST TIME.

I am lacking office decorating skills. Show us your skills. 

All pictures will be entered into a vote on December 20. Winner will receive a 1 year of oil changes. (See Tranum Auto associate for details)
1455 2018-12-06 21:36:55 I'm really tryna advance career wise for my future kids and buy more oil pastels & large canvases.
1456 2018-12-06 21:36:49 y’all be like “if you’re anxious just purchase some cbd oil from a gas station where you also purchase gas! It’s a great idea and 100% legit”
1457 2018-12-06 21:36:47 Get yourself a nice strong edible hard to come by in my opinion.  That gram of oil if it was done properly would knock you out for a day
1458 2018-12-06 21:36:47 Beer bottle brown and amber beach glass paired with Laguna Lace agatesoil at the close up of these beautiful stones! 
1459 2018-12-06 21:36:46 lol my my most played songs on spotify is basically just the entirety of Oil of Every Pearl Un-Insides. you can say that SOPHIE did it it for me this year
1460 2018-12-06 21:36:35 OPEC tentatively agreed to an oil output cut on Thursday but was waiting for a commitment from non-OPEC heavyweight Russia before deciding the exact volumes for a production reduction aimed at propping up crude prices
1461 2018-12-06 21:36:33 @CNBCClosingBell @WilfredFrost @MorganLBrennan @michaelsantoli Ironically,#Trump making #oil cheaper for #China,offsetting #tariffs impact (by how much?). China wins here; 1)China imports more oil than #USA, 2)US world largest producer by country, 40% met by own oil. #wti #brent
1462 2018-12-06 21:36:22 I’ve just finished Art of the Deal audiobook. Conclusion - Trump loves to use reversal psychology to get what he wants. USA reports all time high oil export numbers today. They cant stand cheap oil. Trump desperately needs quick comeback to 80$ or more. #OOTT #opec #wti #brent
1463 2018-12-06 21:36:21 Hillary won't dignify Donald with a glance?  Donald cannot be dignified.  Clowns, runaway trains, and snake oil salesmen have no dignity.
And Roland, he hates being called "Donald."
1464 2018-12-06 21:36:16 No. I do not recommend putting it directly on the skin. Using a moisturizer to follow isn’t really diluting it. If you’re going to use it at all it should be used with a carrier oil.
1465 2018-12-06 21:36:00 Prime example of how many European Caucasians still feel abt Native Indigenous ppl. We came in prayer and peacefulness. They came to destroy us. From the infiltration of our ppl so they could start trouble. All the way to physical damage of ppl. They came to hurt us, all for oil
1466 2018-12-06 21:35:59 Where is the stereotype?  That guy is mocking the democrats cuz they go against his government's interest. Saudi arabia an absolute monarchy with an oil based economy. Bone saw in reference to the horrifc way his crown prince killed  his critic jamal khashogi
1467 2018-12-06 21:35:56 You do realize CBD oil has such a miniscule amount of THC in it, if any, that it's not going to make anyone sleepy.
(Unless this was sarcasm. In that case please use  to signify that. 
Thank you)
1468 2018-12-06 21:35:54 Ik neem aan dat u hier meer van weet dan ik. Vanwege vreemde subsidie regelingen wordt bij mijn weten vandaag de dag voornamelijk slachtafval (AF) en Used Cooking Oil (UCO) gebruikt?
In W Europa iig wel, dacht ik
(UCO uit China is natuurlijk ook niet echt low CO2 footprint!)
1469 2018-12-06 21:35:46 But that’s why the good Lordt said let there be CBD oil.
1470 2018-12-06 21:35:24 My wife of 12 years is a tough but fair Patriot and a loving mother of a U.S. Marine and an oil field worker of who we are very proud of. Follow her @cinkay22 she loved Trump way before he came down the elevator, just like most everyone else did. #MAGA #KAG

1472 2018-12-06 21:35:17 Shoutout to Holly at @Valvoline for working to try and get my hubcap fixed that they broke, but pissed it's been a month and it's still not fixed. Never going there for an oil change again.
1473 2018-12-06 21:35:08 PSA for people who dont sleep through the night very well: CBD oil is amazing! I take a dose of it sublingually every morning and sleep like a rock at night! I started about a week ago and already notice a huge difference
1474 2018-12-06 21:34:59 I would have, but didn't have time today to seize the opportunity.  I'm CEO of an oil and gas company in Dallas, very busy day.  thanks for all of the communication via SB squawk, very helpful and I follow it closely.
1475 2018-12-06 21:34:58 1/2 For the life of me I don’t understand the extreme outrage over the murder of a non American journalist Jamal Khashoggi. What happened to him was terrible. Yes! I agree! But I also know that a fractured relationship because of it with respect to oil prices out of Saudi Arabia
1476 2018-12-06 21:34:56 @Zomato, the food that I ordered was full of oil and people will definitely fall sick after having that food. Also, the support of Zomato is very bad and they can't help me as my food got delivered at 00:22 and I am complaining about it at 3:00.
1477 2018-12-06 21:34:55 My small children live in England while I’ve been hit hard by oil prices here in Alberta. Hope you can find it in your heart to choose me. I’d spend the money visiting with my girls this coming Valentines.

1481 2018-12-06 21:34:44 Loving the sound of the lip shine with  Cacao butter, rose flower oil, vanilla and gold sparkles. Sounds gorgeous!
1482 2018-12-06 21:34:40 can someone tell me what essential oil diffuser to buy bc i know i want one but idk enough to choose which one !!!!
1483 2018-12-06 21:34:25 Believe this survey was conducted based on 2016 data. We certainly hope to see a positive move in the oil and gas arena as so many small biz owners service the oilfield and have been significantly impacted by the downtown.
1484 2018-12-06 21:34:18 I'd be incredibly surprised if oil execs weren't also donating to Cruz in vast numbers. More than likely many of the same oil execs.
1485 2018-12-06 21:34:16 This fuckin dude at the oil change spot ripped the trim off my Cadi poppin the trunk and now I’m next door at the body shop watching them try to fix it... while I try not to lose my fuckin mind... no good
1486 2018-12-06 21:34:15 I know I let one of my friends borrow my oil pen and if it's the cat I think it was I will have to argue to the death over it prolly gonna have to buy a new one 
1487 2018-12-06 21:33:47 It’s about the long game. Oil & gas are non-renewable in the human life span and therefore finite. We are better than this. We need our good researchers and environmental scientists now more than ever—their activism, contextual insights and vocals.
1488 2018-12-06 21:33:46 We have many other industries but the oil industry is the most significant by far.
1489 2018-12-06 21:33:46 と言いつつもう既に駅にいるんだけど
1490 2018-12-06 21:33:42 I think he’s “ helped “ enough. Putting oil on rail instead of building pipelines. Lunacy...
1491 2018-12-06 21:33:42 probably moving oil for CEI helping your own cause
1492 2018-12-06 21:33:39 Scott, have you tried CBD oil? I know quite a few people who swear by it. Don’t knock it til you try it.
1493 2018-12-06 21:33:31 The worse thing that can happen if we start going green is that we live in a cleaner environment. Best case scenario,we save the world. You choose your side, scientist & people who want to live on a clean planet, or the side of oil & coal executives & politicians paid off by them

1495 2018-12-06 21:32:59 He clipped that screenshot so you couldn't tell it was for individual donations; he was trying to frame it as Beto was in the pocket of the oil industry and not that people who work in oil (which is a lot of folks in TX) donated individually
1496 2018-12-06 21:32:57 The features of populism are victimhood & blaming others. AB Conservatives deserve an Academy award for their fealty to that! Prentice was right, Albertans need to look in the mirror & stop whining! JT/RN are not responsible for oil prices or for the current lack of pipelines!
1497 2018-12-06 21:32:56 bruh don’t do it if anything try jojoba oil

1499 2018-12-06 21:32:34 What happen to the oil?? Why not building a refinery for Angolan oil. Capitalists will not allow it and we say Amen. Minister Tom Alweendo I thought he will advance it just to say what he said recently. Very dissappointing.
1500 2018-12-06 21:32:30 I'm surprised he's been so tactless towards the US's biggest supplier of oil.

It's almost like he doesn't know that's the case.

1505 2018-12-06 21:31:59 Follow the illegal petrol joints, that's where the oil "losses" have been accumulated over the years.... money too nice nobody willing to fix

1507 2018-12-06 21:31:44 some tips! lavender oil put a lil on your pillow and that helps. keep anything that creates static energy away from you when you sleep (phone / computer) those keep your mind still awake 
1508 2018-12-06 21:31:26 Exxon employees have an definite interest to keep up the extraction game, keep that oil flowing, keep the fracking "man camps" going, the money growing into their pockets. So they lobby pols with their fossil fuel income dollars to protect their jobs in dirty industries.
1509 2018-12-06 21:31:20 I’ve got some good contacts in Wood, do you want me to make some enquires about what they’re doing in this arena? The oil industry is talking about ‘big data’ as if it’s something revolutionary, maybe something in there.
1510 2018-12-06 21:31:10 Cookies are all done, car is retrieved from it's oil change, and chicken is in the instant pot. Time for a glass of wine and maybe a game of something

1512 2018-12-06 21:31:03 Meanwhile Westminster is taking 92% of our oil to balance it out.

1514 2018-12-06 21:30:56 That's the difficulty at foodbank - no bread, no potatoes, no veg, butter marg or cooking oil etc to spin it out -  by the time people get to the foodbank the cupboard is literally bare
1515 2018-12-06 21:30:56 Also tried cannabis oil. That gave relief and allowed some sleep.

1528 2018-12-06 21:29:42 even if true , large pinch of salt included , Aberdeen has needed a bypass for decades - neither Westminster or a Labour Holyrood had intention to supply.

1529 2018-12-06 21:29:35 Have you ever seen an analysis of what would happen if the oil and gas sector collapsed in Scotland? Do you think the country could take it?
1530 2018-12-06 21:29:30 I just saw that oil guy on TV out west somewhere that killed is wife and two small daughter's. Buried the mom in shallow grave and put the 2 little girls in oil tanks. He needs to be strapped to a chair and fried slow!

1535 2018-12-06 21:28:38 I was originally getting all new tires and whatever else needs to happen when u get new tires and then I needed a back light put in and then an oil change and then my gas lines were broken or something idk but it added on $200 more to the original $400 I was asked for
1536 2018-12-06 21:28:33 I'm sure the 2,278 Iraqi civilians killed and 5,965 wounded in Gulf War 1 have fond memories of 41. I'm sure His Highness Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, The 3rd Emir of the State of Kuwait is happy we got his oil back.
1537 2018-12-06 21:28:33 Need more info. I would assume they're not going to open each individual puck, as there will be billions of them. Also the plastic and the polymer are made from oil. I'd think they add some other liquid or maybe other pucks that react together.

1541 2018-12-06 21:28:23 The #oil and #gas sector will help powering Ireland's #energy transition. In a recent report, the @IAEngineering said: “Natural gas will be essential for Ireland's transition to a low-carbon future.”
1542 2018-12-06 21:28:04 That happened when the price of oil fell. I’m from Alberta and hard times were here before Trudeau or Notley. It’s been convenient for right wingers like Scheer and Kenny to scapegoat but it’s just not the truth.  I’m not buying it.
1543 2018-12-06 21:27:59 Where’s it all leading to ?
USA, Russia & Saudi Arabia are all major oil producers and hoping to keep Iran & Quatar out of the game.
How long ?
Latest technologies & renewables are not helpful either.
1544 2018-12-06 21:27:38 lol no bc the roads are slippery from the oil. Since it never rains, it doesn’t get washed away over time.

1548 2018-12-06 21:27:11 Who wants to take my car to get an oil change? I don’t feel like waiting lol 
1549 2018-12-06 21:27:10 Doubt it Marco - Trump administration will release her. You brave senators are more keen on going after Saudi Arabia an ally. Hope they break off relations with US & hike the price of oil & kiss the Russians, then only will you idiots understand it was a stupid mistake.

1567 2018-12-06 21:25:00 The Dow closed down 79 points Thursday, mostly recovering from an earlier selloff that left the index down by as much as 785 points. U.S. oil prices tumbled nearly three percent. BU-99TH
1568 2018-12-06 21:24:59 Another heart of the conflict possibly is pipelines for gas and oil
1569 2018-12-06 21:24:59 I have you thought about what non primary energy oil demand could look like in the future? Maybe a poor analogy, but share of energy from biomass is a lower portion of total global wood demand now than in 1970.

1579 2018-12-06 21:24:16 Horizon oil well is & eat some oysters,clams, shrimps & fish. Then top it off by going 2 the South West & eating some lettuce. Maybe, just maybe. They’ll get the message.# oh, then cancel their gov. health insurance.
1580 2018-12-06 21:24:14 Dandruff around the tail base is pretty common. Could be they aren't drinking enough, or they can't reach to clean it. Brush regularly and feed a diet with abit of oil in it (wet food if they'll eat it, or few drops of fish oil in dry food)
1581 2018-12-06 21:24:02 He’s not he’s actually a Pres dedicated to the people not OIL, or SOCIALSM, or OTHER GARBAGE!
1582 2018-12-06 21:24:00 oh how am i doing? i just shook up an oil paint marker, forgot what i was doing, and tried to vape it
1583 2018-12-06 21:23:47 Juan Luis Peña - we requested tnat oil give us 6% of their profits for clean energy in Mexico. 0.66% was approved. We now have solar and wave research centers because of this funding. #PacSurf2018
1584 2018-12-06 21:23:31 I got an oil change there and my drain plug came off while driving and drained all my oil my car shut down and I was in the rain had to pay to get it fixed

What about the auto worker? 
What about Steel &Alum tarrifs?
What about oil price?
Why no pipelines built?

1588 2018-12-06 21:23:02 Scientists are wrong all the time. Instead of trying to convince people, why not stop #FakeNews about @Tesla so people buy more electric cars? The MSM, which is primarily controlled by oil companies is constantly writing bogus stories about Tesla.
1589 2018-12-06 21:22:48 #oil is Goin up when cuts are agreed.  Might be this weekend instead of tomorrow. My forecst is $3 to $4 rise in a few days then it will rise more as positive news is released, then backwardation, then a peak in 2-4 months in the $70-$80 WTI range then a small pull back. JMO 
1590 2018-12-06 21:22:47 But coconut oil treats me too well.

And then of coz there's herbalife aloe bar soap also 
Andisemhle man
1591 2018-12-06 21:22:41 I hope you hide “oil money bastards” written in the same colour as the background on each one?
1592 2018-12-06 21:22:32 Same here. Proximity to Oil capital speeds up delivery of diesel parts, bearings and heavy tools. Doesn't do much for sheep advancement.
1593 2018-12-06 21:22:30 Eh too confusing imo... "Cannabis oil" usually refers to oil with a lot of delta 9 THC in it. You don't want to accidentally take @stiiizy thinking it's CBD oil, you will get reaaaallly high
1594 2018-12-06 21:22:25 Fits the old saying " Do as I say , not as I do" comes to mind there  is NO Climate Change . The same amount of water is the same since  creation, the same amount of dirt, gas,oil isn't made from Dino's that  lie was paid for by Rockefeller so he could control oil prices.TRUTH
1595 2018-12-06 21:22:08 Cook it until soft. Gently mix with best butter +cream. Add small slivers of garlick fried in olive oil. Crumble small amounts of mature imported feta. Not too much. When ready position carefully on a plate. Then with great sensitivity throw it away +have cuppa-T + a penguin.
1596 2018-12-06 21:22:07 wow CrossFit really kicked my butt this morning!

1597 2018-12-06 21:21:59 We Can Safely Assume There Are Oil, Natural Gas And Coal Deposits To The North.. Fossil Fuels And Clean Energy Need Full Attention By A Committed Body.. A Brand New City By A Water Source Would Support Wise Growth And Be Socially Exciting..
1598 2018-12-06 21:21:48 I hate going to the oil change alone bc they take advantage of my lack of car knowledge and I end up droppin $150 on shit I’m not even sure is real!!!!!!!!!
1599 2018-12-06 21:21:44 #TreasonsGreetings Canada  As you financially Struggle in the upcoming years remember why Canada  is loosing 80 Million Dollars a Day just in Oil not including the Millions a month for telling illegals we have open borders. #Vote2019WeMustSaveCanadaVote2019
1600 2018-12-06 21:21:41 Buy some beard oil then. Avocado oil is cheaper and then you can use it for searing meats at a very high temperature.
1601 2018-12-06 21:21:40 i put coconut oil on my face for the first time ever two days ago n i broke out #NeverAgain
1602 2018-12-06 21:21:34 I would get the Fava beans, and a nice Chianti Fffff.....Fffff....LOL Or perhaps the-Barbequed octopus marinated in olive oil seasoned with mint, lemon zest & oregano-Angel hair with scallops, shrimp, jumbo lump crabmeat & roma tomatoes in a brandy cream sauce- Secondi-Rib Eye
1603 2018-12-06 21:21:30 ... using sunflower oil is a giving them attention they don’t deserve .. Burn them at the stake hungry
1604 2018-12-06 21:21:22 Ain’t no thang, sunshine.Talcum does serve many a purpose but it’s wise to be careful if using it. However, corn starch is good stuff too & if you want to give it scent, put it in a glass container w/ 2 cotton balls wet w/ your fave perfume or oil & shake it for 1 or 2 wks.
1605 2018-12-06 21:21:20 Bah, Lantern & oil, torches are a pain.
1606 2018-12-06 21:21:15 Omg like Randy, solve the oil crisis ! !

Easy. 3D printers, dummies. 3D print the oil, we dont need Tesla
1607 2018-12-06 21:21:03 And the electric cars that cause no pollution because when you plug them in the electricity is magically produced. Not by a coal, oil, or nuclear power plant...

1610 2018-12-06 21:20:13 y'all date full grown men who wear fanny packs across their chest, quadruple-folded beanies in warm weather while juuling in their excessively-stickered subaru with a diet that's 50% 4 lokos, 30% hot pockets and 20% synthetic motor oil out here like "ahh he's the one "

Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.  @TheEastDoveTV
1615 2018-12-06 21:19:48 Our politicians are not coward. They are supported by the lobbies that want still to drill oil, dig coal and frack, let alone uproot the rainforests to plant soy and palms for oil. They are tied to the big corporations that fund them in order to carry out their dirty business.
1616 2018-12-06 21:19:43 I feel a cold coming on, I need some castor oil pills
1617 2018-12-06 21:19:38 Yes, send a tough message while at the same time buying oil from them. 

That makes sense @washingtonpost
1618 2018-12-06 21:19:36 Not sure you know this so let me help you out... you’re selling snake oil. Even if YOU really beleive in it it’s still snake oil.
1619 2018-12-06 21:19:31 Over the past decade, Alberta has contributed $220 billion to Canada in net transfer payments- more than any other province. Oil production cuts announced by Premier @RachelNotley are a short term solution and the gains in prices will likely stabilize soon. Give Alberta $#abpoli

1622 2018-12-06 21:19:28 You ever have the Portuguese mayo they sell in some shops that is 100% olive oil? So good
1623 2018-12-06 21:19:28 God really is so good man went to get an oil change & the dealer did it for free! Good karma has been coming to me & im so blessed for it
1624 2018-12-06 21:19:22 Ya girl made 713$.... So 200$ for rent, 140$ for my insurance, 65$ for WiFi, 50$ for student loan, 3$ for icloud storage, 5$ for Apple Music, 45$ for oil change.... anything else? So that leaves me with 200$ to myself  But the 200$ will go toward gifts & gas

1630 2018-12-06 21:18:52 Looks like she got herself with the hot oil
1631 2018-12-06 21:18:50 are you familiar with the energy potential of oil versus the alternatives? have you ever taken a university-level energy physics course?
1632 2018-12-06 21:18:47  even if we were to stop all oil and coal use tomorrow it would be too late to remove the carbon they have produced. Solar power can’t remove carbon from the atmosphere and refreeze the polar ice caps. You literally have to invent a time machine.
1633 2018-12-06 21:18:47 Today’s Prices:
92.9 Regular 
114.9 Diesel 
100.9 Furnace Oil
1634 2018-12-06 21:18:44 And back then, the flow from that oasis was much stronger then now. We can actually calculate that if the saudis ever allowed it. Its the same process when finding oil, you calculate the flow before you buy equipment.
1635 2018-12-06 21:18:40 Also add some eucalyptus essential oil drops into your shower or bath and itll also help clear you up!
1636 2018-12-06 21:18:36 Also these are employee donations. Newsflash: a lot of oil industry workers in Texas, even senior employees/management, are Democrats.
1637 2018-12-06 21:18:33 I swear bruh 
1638 2018-12-06 21:18:24 Damn I leave to go get an oil change and do a few errands for two hours and y'all have found something new to argue about.
1639 2018-12-06 21:18:18 Trump fears political price from oil spike
1640 2018-12-06 21:18:04 は？家寒すぎか？
1641 2018-12-06 21:18:03 Who’s tryna help ya boy out to do an oil change on my car? :-)
1642 2018-12-06 21:18:01 Question everything.  I was sick for a long time, guess what it was the supplements.  I researched it all and they all made in China except for one. They use tricky wording, they package here for the USA label and say from International Sources.  Probably the same thing with oil
1643 2018-12-06 21:17:52 Why are you pushing dead end jobs instead of careers that stand a chance of existing fifty years from now? We need jobs, but not dying ones.

We phased out whale oil, now it's time to phase out coal. New jobs, please, not dead-ends.
1644 2018-12-06 21:17:50 服ちゃんと着てんのに湯冷めして無理
1645 2018-12-06 21:17:50 I mean, we have had to rotate players due to injuries. Just because we don’t have the oil money to run and buy every player available 
1646 2018-12-06 21:17:47  this thing I read is so funny aswear na tears go full the group ai
1647 2018-12-06 21:17:39 you probably should use a thicker moisturizer then it’s prob the cold humidity that’s drying out ur skin and making ur skin produce more oil
1648 2018-12-06 21:17:38 Thank you so much Nick for the help with my meds. Went out to the farm in Sumas today to grab more of the oil to help with the chemo treatments. Nice drive with my Mom to the Valley today. Back at home getting healthy
1649 2018-12-06 21:17:36 Will any of the All Star races be on Lucas Oil Racing TV for those who can't get MAVTV?
1650 2018-12-06 21:17:27 either way, non premium diesel is between $2.35 and $2.70 AUD a litre where I live, so fuel up your dirty oil burner with the good shit and think of me.
1651 2018-12-06 21:17:25 Which essential oil will give me a boyfriend lol
1652 2018-12-06 21:17:23 Rabo Karabekian and talk much, said Fred, who they taught him an oil slick on the center caused a Robo-Magic motto was simply
1653 2018-12-06 21:17:20 *Breaking News!!!*

Insider sources from Ottawa inform Canada Wide News that people all across Canada are befuddled that issues such as the oil crisis weren’t on the list of topics.  And @gmbutts called Canadians Nazis.  They are upset about that too.

This is all.

1657 2018-12-06 21:16:39 I really wish my car would leave me alone. Dead battery Friday. Tire light yesterday. Oil light today. 
1658 2018-12-06 21:16:31 This one na confirm crude oil pleaseyou have no idea of how much liters I fit get from there
1659 2018-12-06 21:16:30 edamame spinach. . .17

1660 2018-12-06 21:16:28 Spe .... Oil and gas
1661 2018-12-06 21:16:25 The point is it’s going down. You don’t know na tumaas ang crude oil and China and US trade war affected also our currency? These also contributed to inflation.
1662 2018-12-06 21:16:19 i’m getting my oil changed by MYSELF i’m a grown ass woman

1664 2018-12-06 21:16:17 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
1665 2018-12-06 21:16:15 We don’t need oil at all...
1666 2018-12-06 21:16:11 @chigrl Welp oil down, no missiles fired by DPKR, no warships rammed, strong dollar, some markets still up for the year, Fed capitulating, everyone hates him. Why wouldn't Trump feel like he is winning, expect more to come.
1667 2018-12-06 21:16:08 i guess i'm wondering why they said "schedule a service if your oil life is 15% or your miles are 5k".  something doesn't add up there.
1668 2018-12-06 21:16:06 wtf get that dog some canine CBD oil asap
1669 2018-12-06 21:16:02 97% scientists agree, so we need to make sure the 3% funded by big oil get as much time and 50/50 exposure as the sane ones... 
1670 2018-12-06 21:15:59 All my oil stocks have gone down more than 20% the past 6 weeks, because of Trumps push for a lower oil price
1671 2018-12-06 21:15:57 I wish I had someone to pay for my oil change 
1672 2018-12-06 21:15:57 The CBD oil I've been trying for sleep has 0.3% TCH in it.
Also the tests they use often dont discriminate between CBD and TCH. They just see cannabinoids. So while I've never imbibed an illicit substance, my pee says I did.
1673 2018-12-06 21:15:55 Yes, did tech pull future production forward or did it unlock new oil we couldn’t get or anticipate getting
1674 2018-12-06 21:15:54 Not to worry! Coal plants are more costly to build and operate. It is more costly to transport than oil or natural gas, oil and natural gas are transported by highly efficient and economical pipeline.
1675 2018-12-06 21:15:54 ممكن سناب مفلح وفيصل اخويا فارس لاهنتي 
1676 2018-12-06 21:15:50 Same - I've just been using rosehip & argan oil. Sometimes I stumble across a beauty video or advert and I feel this pressure to be buying more expensive creams etc. Its like we're all in competition to age the least.
1677 2018-12-06 21:15:49 But it's modern Dem politics. Everything has to be the best or worst or perfect or fail. Not enough to say Beto has an OK enviro record, but not nearly strong enough. Gotta say he's NUMBER 1 in oil $ (leaving aside he's 1 most categories, as a product of his small donor record).
1678 2018-12-06 21:15:48 Finally back online now how much compensation @o2 #O2Down #Compensation #Unacceptable £££
1679 2018-12-06 21:15:39 What's wrong with the oil from the US?  You are so hell bent on buying from Saudi Arabia, a powder keg in the world, why bother messing around with them?
1680 2018-12-06 21:15:31 $OIL down at $50 = No #Inflation  driver ! = Consumers Happy !
1681 2018-12-06 21:15:28 And eat a gram of cannabis oil
1682 2018-12-06 21:15:26 We produce 10 million barrels of oil per day and consume 18 million.  We are not energy independent
1683 2018-12-06 21:15:24 I've got laryngitis.  Protect your voice...use honey, lemon, garlic, oil of oregano....anything. Drink hot liquids and avoid the cold. I stood outside for 4 hours yesterday, pretty sure this is why I'm voiceless.
1684 2018-12-06 21:15:23 The sovereign country can be energy-independent, living off whatever gas or oil or coal it can produce. It can consume its products completely within its borders, and import nothing.
1685 2018-12-06 21:15:20 Well, nearly, I must say Popcorn and olive oil at 3700kj /sitting (mainly the oil) gave me a huge surprise when I logged it
1686 2018-12-06 21:15:16 Man the tweet in the article that said her piss look like motor oil took me out
1687 2018-12-06 21:15:10 We loan you $, now we own your oil

1690 2018-12-06 21:14:58 Interestingly - France primarily uses nuclear for its electricity ( a different can of worms ) - only uses 1.74 million barrels of oil a day
1691 2018-12-06 21:14:56 Nope. Scrunch out the crunch once dry, using the argan oil. You can learn all about the curly girl method by googling it. There’s also a group on Facebook.
1692 2018-12-06 21:14:47 I have recently read taking Evening Primrose Oil mayhelp some with nerve pain issues.  I am hopeful. It can take months to take effect though.
1693 2018-12-06 21:14:40 Beto "loves" oil & gas? Really?  On what do you base that, or did you just pull it out of your a**?
1694 2018-12-06 21:14:32 I remember gas being close to 5.00 in 2012when that idiot Obama was in office. He stopped oil drilling. We are seeing low prices because Trump has started up drilling again!
1695 2018-12-06 21:14:22 @JustinTrudeau Why have you refused to include the Alberta Pipeline crisis and the low price of Alberta crude oil on the First Ministers meeting agenda?Are you a totalitarian disconnected from Alberta and Western Canadian needs? It seems surfer dude Trudeau and the liberals are!

1697 2018-12-06 21:13:59 There isn't a sensor or anything, It is just a counter. My Honda Odyssey is the same. I change my oil every 5k miles but I think it gets to 0% around every 8k or 10k miles.

1700 2018-12-06 21:13:50 A "100 percent [Essential Oil]" should not come with any other ingredients than said essential oil, no? Or am I missing something?
1701 2018-12-06 21:13:49 Sorry to hear this! We haven't changed the formula other than the essential oil scent blend. Please contact our Customer Care team at 1800-211-4279 or info@seventhgeneration.com so we can help with this issue.
1702 2018-12-06 21:13:40 Damon bit his lip to suppress a grin. 

He gently rubbed his oil covered hands over his broad shoulders, down his bulging biceps and muscular chest. So enjoyable the task was, Damon wound up using the whole vial.

"Oops." He chuckled slightly. "Make that some VERY nice dreams."
1703 2018-12-06 21:13:35 gotchu yeah there’s a lot of moisture here and my face still isn’t used to that so i produce a lot of oil smh
1704 2018-12-06 21:13:26 Since am not representing your fathers farmland you can fuck off, nobody gives a damn about a tribalist and ethnic jingoist spewing jejune and insipid insinuations against people they dont know.
Go and reevaluate your life.
Pure and sheer animalistic tendencies you're portraying

1707 2018-12-06 21:13:20 Francisco is a  marketing specialist that likes Mustard oil on their meatballs pizza with vodka
1708 2018-12-06 21:13:04 Weeelllllll his WMD false accusation was a poop frenzy of massive proportions and caused the US far more pain than it could ever have been worth in his oil... Lest we forget.... I won’t forgive him for that.
1709 2018-12-06 21:12:54 I was going to suggest avocado oil. I used it when i get real dry spots during the winter in my beard. But mayo has oil so yeah do this.
1710 2018-12-06 21:12:53 Nobody is buying this lie. Your director still works for coal and oil, that's all he'll be remembered for
1711 2018-12-06 21:12:36 We are coming politically to collapse through the government of Mr. Adel Al.Mahdi. This, leading to chaos, country domination by gangs with organized crimes and oil thieves.
Iraq, for its part, is losing geographic unity with its components.
1712 2018-12-06 21:12:27 Sir, we need to get away from Oil.
1713 2018-12-06 21:12:03 Do bald guys lotion their heads? How are their heads so shiny even during the winter? Is it oil???? Or natural??? I’m confused.

1716 2018-12-06 21:11:50 Bio oil bro , works wonders
1717 2018-12-06 21:11:33 Canadian oil industry does not set prices. Most price manipulation has been thru OPEC...just another friendly group of sovereign governments. You can't blame industry, much as you might like to. They too are, clearly, pawns in a bigger game.
1718 2018-12-06 21:11:32 God this is so stupid!! What are you doing?! Obviously it's neg to report that a candidate receives oil $. And it's MISLEADING if it's employees who are not influencing his policy direction with their donation. You are being shady.
1719 2018-12-06 21:11:28 Jonny we have some of the most stringent environmental requirements in the world and carefully regulated. Shipping dirty Saud oil from a corrupt regime by diesel tankers is beyond crazy...
1720 2018-12-06 21:11:20 So I see someone saying @JamaicaPNP knew exactly what they left at #petrojam and waited to pass the blame. MI RAAH suh a #PNP throw di party? Even IF oil was missing before WHO missing up the rest of the oil? Is PNP stop board meeting from Keep? Dem run HR? talk to mi
1721 2018-12-06 21:11:19 I like marinating them with oil and vinegar.
1722 2018-12-06 21:11:19 Please where an we admit this Amcon Debtor to? Because the way an seeing it, the gods have hands in his matter
1723 2018-12-06 21:11:15 i think shorting the cannabis industry is like shorting the railroads during the Cornelius Vanderbilt era, or shorting Standard Oil/John D. Rockefeller Sr. building the nascent oil industry in the 19th century.
1724 2018-12-06 21:11:14 Renewable is now cheaper than fossil! Oil economics actually don’t work anymore!
1725 2018-12-06 21:11:11 Personally, I don't give a rat's ass about the rest of the world's oil needs

France needs to buy its oil from somebody... it doesn't HAVE to be us
1726 2018-12-06 21:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza of the day will be: sad crust with wet motor oil and pulled pork.
1727 2018-12-06 21:11:00 @realDonaldTrump  Whats the matter. Mr, President? Standard Oil got you down. Remember why we voted for you. Big Money (for some reason you'r immune) is the enemy.
1728 2018-12-06 21:10:57 Just had raw spinach w: egg salad. Instead of mayo I used hummus, olive oil and a pinch of sea salt  definitely gotta do this again.
1729 2018-12-06 21:10:48 First Ministers discussion on oil should be top item, as should the carbon tax on top of an economic slowdown - given Ottawa pooched pipeline project approvals. You don’t kick people or provinces when they are down - while also accepting other provinces buying Saudi oil. Come on!
1730 2018-12-06 21:10:48 grate it and mix it with coconut oil and massage it into your scalp. let it sit for 30 minutes and wash as usual
1731 2018-12-06 21:10:47 Segregation of ideas is not our thing. We are everywhere now. What is wrong with India? China(you don’t buy made in China products?)Venezuela the richest country in oil of the world. People are starving; sanctions at work.. are you jealous of others ressources? Visit Cuba!! See!
1732 2018-12-06 21:10:46 Sometimes I use coconut oil, sometimes too some Nivea bi laidat
1733 2018-12-06 21:10:41 Only having to get an oil change once a year probs the best thing about my Audi.
1734 2018-12-06 21:10:38 @RachelNotley Why aren't you Rachel Notley /Alberta NDP not willing to walk away from the first ministers meeting table if the Pipeline oil pricing disaster is not on the Agenda!Are you a yes woman to surfer dude Trudeau and his anti Alberta Liberals?It seems you are!!
1735 2018-12-06 21:10:35 Ahhh bro e no be crude oil fa 
1736 2018-12-06 21:10:31 But that's not possible. 
One "side" is 99%  of climatologists saying we need to change things ASAP or we are dead.
The other "side" is 1% of scientists, sitting on top of piles of money from gas, coal and oil companies, saying "Are you sure? Like Really REALLY sure? I dunno.."
1737 2018-12-06 21:10:26 specifically a ramping tax on the fuel inefficiency (liters petrol / km) of *new* car purchases and a matching credit for scrapping old cars would get more people driving Zoes or using public transport, but as you say imperialists like Macron love oil

1740 2018-12-06 21:10:23 how does my honda know the 'oil life' of my current oil? it's currently at like 70%. it doesn't seem like it's a function of 5k miles, since i've only got 3k miles on it so far.
1741 2018-12-06 21:10:20 The world has the technology to use solar, wind and water...WHY ARE WE STILL USING MEDIEVAL TECHNOLOGY.. oh ya, the money. Oil...  Imagine if we didn't use oil

1743 2018-12-06 21:10:18 I'm just saying: if your campaign isn't threatening to oil executives, you may very well be doing something wrong
1744 2018-12-06 21:10:15 I have been migraine free for almost a week after being anointed with oil and prayed over by my mom and Alex. The Bible talks about doing this to heal others. God is good. 
1745 2018-12-06 21:10:12 Straight up they gave you oil but didn’t change the filter man

1748 2018-12-06 21:09:55 Well I guess it's easier for Jamaicans to process the 1000USD cake than the missing barrels seeing that most of us nuh really understand how the oil thing guh but all a wi know cake...
1749 2018-12-06 21:09:51 Oh no.  Remember when CONgress held hearings on the evil oil speculators when oil was over $100?  Same thing with equities... as long as it is up that is "good"
1750 2018-12-06 21:09:47 Other piles of trash did everything they could to keep CBD oil out of WI, even with all the research proving it to be effective treatment
1751 2018-12-06 21:09:31 The news was so bad that I fell out of bed

There was a gas strike, oil strike, lorry strike, bread strike

1754 2018-12-06 21:09:10 I like coconut oil and Elbow Grease, but not condom friendly.
1755 2018-12-06 21:08:57 So cutting oil is like phasing our coal power, at what point are you going to cut checks to oil producers for there loses, and anyone in oil field jobs
1756 2018-12-06 21:08:54 One of them slicked his fingers in oil and shoved them up Alvo’s ass.

1758 2018-12-06 21:08:35 Anxiously awaiting the call from my new mechanic, Brett. Very excited to drive the 88' bmw with new tires, a fresh oil change, and topped off fluids.
1759 2018-12-06 21:08:35 John, CES back in the bi-level days there was a guy selling snake oil to clean cable contacts. No kidding 
1760 2018-12-06 21:08:23 CBD oil can be used as both a stimulant and a relaxer for the body.
1761 2018-12-06 21:08:19 This is the most simpleton analysis ever seen and conclusion down as if extra 100k barrels/day means a thing given delta for Iran etc.  hopefully no one paying for this “analysis”.  #oott

1771 2018-12-06 21:07:19 Norway is miles ahead with the advantage over us of full control but they still find all that green stuff by stripping oil out and selling it.
1772 2018-12-06 21:07:18 However, since we can now produce our own oil, non such a big deal.  There is only about 30 more years left of Saudi oil anyway, they will be out of the oil business before you know it. They have already changed over to Tech.     Dig deeper...

1) What was the total oil revenue for the whole of the UK (which you claim will be all ours post "independence") for 2017/2018 Bill?

2) How much did Scotland receive via Barnett/City Deals for 2017/2018?

I'll keep those clown shoes warm for you.
1819 2018-12-06 21:03:38 I hope you are right. He will have to divest from his oil company donors and be a hard backer for M4A, reversing the tax cuts and heavy regulations for wall st. & polluters.
1820 2018-12-06 21:03:27 This is not correct. EIA data shows the imported 4 million barrels per day of oil more than it exported during the last week of November. This seems to count petroleum products as crude oil.

1834 2018-12-06 21:02:08 The reduction in space overhead and labour costs were the first way the oil companies responded to the structural changes in the industry occasioned by the US shale revolution.

Only legends will know
1836 2018-12-06 21:01:53 Well, We built them to US also because that’s what most oil companies wanted - they spent millions to modify their Gulf Coast refineries. Big mistake to let all that value added go.
1837 2018-12-06 21:01:52 I had to call Ford and make sure these jiffy lube dudes weren’t playing me by saying I needed the more expensive oil. Lucky for them they were right, or I was gonna have to black out on them.
1838 2018-12-06 21:01:46 Awww my little afro it's coming along so great!

Also, MPL oil is bae forever! not only is it keeping my scalp flake free but my hair is so soft and full in vol.
1839 2018-12-06 21:01:38 You’re kind of all over the place. Are you saying that Shell ought not invest more than the “massive” 20% of their net income per year into solar because it’s not clean enough to prioritize vs oil? As opposed to it not being profitable enough for them to prioritize vs oil?
1840 2018-12-06 21:01:36 What are you talking about? There’s no one more left than him. The left’s only gripe is his oil money, but he’s from south TX. That’s the only money.
1841 2018-12-06 21:01:25 Done 
1842 2018-12-06 21:01:24 did I ever tell you guys about the time I went to my dads when he lived in Oregon and my grandma wanted fries but had no oil so she tried to put a box of lard in the deep fryer  I damn near smacked her arm away
1843 2018-12-06 21:01:21 Slice very thin and shallow fry in olive oil
1844 2018-12-06 21:01:20 Healthy nails 
- Take biotin supplements (you can get these at the drug store) 

- Use cuticle oil 

- Buy a soft nail file 

- Soak them in a lemon juice and garlic mixture for 10 minutes (let the mixture sit for 5 minutes first)
1845 2018-12-06 21:01:20 Prescott Scherf/Bush helped fund Hitler, helped start Planned Parenthood for eugenics, helped ruin Tesla for oil profits, and spawned a Nazi globalist to bring in the New World Order. It's unfounded to you because you haven't looked for it. That's why you do Na-zi it.
1846 2018-12-06 21:01:12 WTI Crude Oil 51.56 bbl -1.57, -3.0% $USO
Gold 1243.80 oz +1.40, +1.1% $GLD
Copper 2.74/lb -$0.04, -1.4%  $CU
1847 2018-12-06 21:01:08 it's so bizarre to see political commentary from the "right" blaming PMJT for all of Alberta's current (pipeline) woes. 

the previous PM, darling of Alberta, friend of the oil industry, manged to get z-e-r-o pipelines built. 
1848 2018-12-06 21:01:08 Also, had a thought. Young George P. ain’t working as a land conservationist for nothin’. He will emerge as a  loving,Millennial runner up for the next Bush Oil trust conglomerate #DeepState run in 2028 after Bloomberg & Mouchelle run in 2020. Don’t know how Trump will prevail.
1849 2018-12-06 21:00:59 Omg  someone call bruce Willis and his oil rig crew  its Armageddon again

1851 2018-12-06 21:00:39 Note to self: next time you go for an oil change, bring a good book 
1852 2018-12-06 21:00:28 First is that not everybody could be wrong. But I think that these people got here, how they formed. They took the oil that I can build it and they replace it with Jamiel. You see it in landslide.
1853 2018-12-06 21:00:20 Coconut oil is very healthy. It is high in special fats called medium chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently than other fats
1854 2018-12-06 21:00:20 Oh! Thank you.
1855 2018-12-06 21:00:16 Yes, Ireland is well known for its massive oil fields and billionaires.
1856 2018-12-06 21:00:09 Why didn't u support the electric cars being made back in the 90s such as the EV1, we could of almost fully of transitioned to electric by now, if big oil companies had supported it.
1857 2018-12-06 21:00:05 You fellas went all fuzzy nice when Hillery was sporting the head rag with Saudi prince/$$$ Alaweed. 25 mill in oil $$ donated to the Hildabeast.
1858 2018-12-06 20:59:54 Prospect that oil rich nations won't be able to sell oil within a few years will likely encourage them to do something.  It'll be their bad if they don't.
1859 2018-12-06 20:59:45 Oil Tanker Me Pakistani Bachay Iran Smuggle Karne Ka Inkishaf, 6 Saala Farishta Noor Mardan Ki Bachi Baziyab, 3 Saal Pehlay Lapata Huwi Thi.
1860 2018-12-06 20:59:30 Every time Pence speaks, sounds like a preacher who's a snake oil salesmen.
1861 2018-12-06 20:59:15 Get the fuck out too, you're very stupid, practice what you preach.
You just opened your dirty mouth to spew trash and attribute that to me as if you knew me somewhere and expect me to welcome you.
Madam I'll meet you with your medicine dan uwarda ta haihe ki
1862 2018-12-06 20:58:55 You mean "raise oil prices in a few weeks"?
1863 2018-12-06 20:58:52 No wonder you produce so much oil 
1864 2018-12-06 20:58:46 I’m all out. I hate when livelihood is effected but they literally let their racism decide their vote. I can’t believe they were duped by a snake oil salesmen. This is the excuse everyone uses for voting for him, he promised! He was a hateful liar & everyone knew it before vote
1865 2018-12-06 20:58:41 Oil is!
1866 2018-12-06 20:58:27 True but utterly platitudinous—as we’ve come to expect from the soon to be former premier, unless of course shes trying to bully B.C. over shipping her filthy tar sand oil.
1867 2018-12-06 20:58:18 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,
because once Kyu incorrectly entered oil when
cooking a simple ham.
1868 2018-12-06 20:58:17 My husband has worked in the oil/gas industry for many years and business has rarely been this bad work scarce. Trump wants to cause harm to these families.
1869 2018-12-06 20:57:55 @holland_barrett look what an MIT Scientist thinks of CodLiver Oil DHA after years of research.
1870 2018-12-06 20:57:52 めちゃこのみーーー！

1872 2018-12-06 20:57:34 .@TyJohnsonNews @NatalieEgenolf @MikeMiss975 my wife never finishes her steak; it’s perfect for steak and eggs for breakfast! Bring the steak to room temp, use a hot pan, olive oil, and seat each side for a min.
1873 2018-12-06 20:57:32 I gotta get this tune up ASAP.. need a oil change too
1874 2018-12-06 20:57:26 Ask him why he didn’t fess up that he got $32,881 from oil & gas in 2018!
1875 2018-12-06 20:57:25 You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy." Hebrews 1:9.

1877 2018-12-06 20:57:13 Considering getting everyone a barrel of oil for Christmas cuz we’ll it’s appropriate coming from me and tbh it’s a lot cheaper than some of the other gift options out there right now
1878 2018-12-06 20:57:12 Might have more credibility if it wasn’t, Ian Wood, who told us oil was finished back in 13/14, Bertie Armstrong who believes ( wrongly) he’ll get anything from Brexit and the bulk of Scotch Whisky Association who are ex Foreign Ambassadors or Cambridge educated..go figure!!
1879 2018-12-06 20:57:02 my cousin house stay smelling like jamaican castor oil & wood cleaner 
1880 2018-12-06 20:56:50 @verb I used the ghost oil before blow drying and ended up with super greasy hair  I only used the 2-3 drops as directed
1881 2018-12-06 20:56:42 You've taken over $307,000.00 from oil and gas industries.
1882 2018-12-06 20:56:40 Oil consumption should not be a commodity we use.
Renewable energy is the only way to go.
Nothing else makes sense.
1883 2018-12-06 20:56:40 Really, have you heard of GM closing, have you heard we can't get our oil to market and on and on. These are the issues Trudeau and gang don't want to discuss.
1884 2018-12-06 20:56:37 So, GM just announced that they are laying off workers and are going to focus on electric cars - so we need to find more oil? Really? We’re moving AWAY from fossil fuels, is anyone going to tell him that?
1885 2018-12-06 20:56:23 I'm thinking I maybe should have cleaned up the dried (literally) bloody boxer drool from the back seat before I dropped the car off for an oil change... right?
1886 2018-12-06 20:56:22 the scent of lavender oil always soothing. on a cotton ball or handkerchief.
1887 2018-12-06 20:55:55 Anyone know a good oil change service in or around Fontana?
1888 2018-12-06 20:55:54 Closer to 30 years. Sadly, those guys never recovered until they found oil, and even then it is only for a few people.

Farting around and lying about what he'd done didn't help either.
1889 2018-12-06 20:55:10 Oil be!
1890 2018-12-06 20:55:05 All people who work in the oil industry can’t be trusted now? Do you know how unhinged that sounds?
1891 2018-12-06 20:54:57 My 87 year old grandma asked for CBD oil for Christmas from me 
1892 2018-12-06 20:54:50  I have been very reckless with tea tree oil in the past. Not doing that again. I'm lucky this never happened!
1893 2018-12-06 20:54:44 Beto shows how to support massive pollution to rake in that sweet sweet oil money.
1894 2018-12-06 20:54:42 あっそっか
1895 2018-12-06 20:54:40 Be honest man the problem is people consume. We like stuff and there are a lot of people in the world that like stuff. A band aid like solar and wind is just going draw it out. Oil and gas get $20 billion in subsidies a year. So in 12 yrs at $20 billion a year not going to happen
1896 2018-12-06 20:54:34 Mix some arnica, lavender and frankincense oil with your favorite carrier oil. That will help. Patchouli oil is also good for healing if you like it.
1897 2018-12-06 20:54:31 A solution which works for Norway with a population of barely 5 million with huge oil wealth should not be assumed to work for the UK with 60+ million population and massive nation debt.
1898 2018-12-06 20:54:30 Love your hair and be patient  stress is not good at all! Keep it hydrated and do coconut oil braids at least once a week. Don’t over wash it!
1899 2018-12-06 20:54:25 Beto takes big oil money among others.
1900 2018-12-06 20:54:24 How about a profit margin cap (say 10 %) on corporations and eliminate futures trading to only the original issuer and initial buyer … no more speculating and no more price gouging with record profits for oil and pharmaceuticals. may even stop price inflation all together
1901 2018-12-06 20:54:16 Thankye! Fingers crossed coconut oil is as great as people say.
1902 2018-12-06 20:54:16 How about a case of Racing oil spdlab
1903 2018-12-06 20:54:11 Coconut oil, the scent of your body that lingers on sheets
1904 2018-12-06 20:53:59 You jumped into my mention you idiot. Do I have to remind you how that works on twitter?
Butt out.
1905 2018-12-06 20:53:58 I feel like every time I take my car to get an oil change they tell me something else I need repaired.. like bitch I could have bought a whole new car by now 
1906 2018-12-06 20:53:48 Fun fact: If the USA minded their own damn business & stayed out of the middle east, Haiti & other countries where they meddled for no reason or for oil, there wouldn’t be as much misery & wars and you might not have to donate as much.
1907 2018-12-06 20:53:41 Came for an oil change n he talking bout i need not one , but two new tires  NIGGA IM BROKE
1908 2018-12-06 20:53:41 My point is oil execs who hate Cruz would donate to Beto over Cruz. But if it was Beto vs a Bush they would donate to Bush. Is that really that difficult to understand?
1909 2018-12-06 20:53:41 If she doesn’t care and she doesn’t vote for protecting our climate and our planet then she must be being paid big money by Big Oil and other fossil fuel corporations! It’s an American did not stand up for our citizens, planet and our future! we should be leading this fight!
1910 2018-12-06 20:53:38 No, she's on CBD oil so I dont think she's in pain....She needs to use the bathroom often 
1911 2018-12-06 20:53:28 Have you ever thought about the increase in the US carbon footprint that will increase with illegal immigration or the need for more oil to support the influx of people!
1912 2018-12-06 20:53:28 But not in Alberta oil patch according to Jason
1913 2018-12-06 20:53:20 1st Minister's agenda looks like 90 mins of prime minister & Pipelines and oil prices, Carbon pricing, Bill C-69, Auto Sector, removing prov'l trade barriers, Cannabis supply, & asylum seekers. Interests rates and oil tankers should be there too
1914 2018-12-06 20:53:10 I’ve done lino, litho, screen, watercolor/oil/ink monotypes. I’ve been doin it for a while wish I could learn to do woodblock at some point
1915 2018-12-06 20:53:02 Cos they smell of palm oil & yam
1916 2018-12-06 20:52:51 I think there is likely a way to move away from oil etc and replace those jobs with jobs in new ventures. But they have to be there for them before we put 100,000 people out work. We just need a will to do so-not insufferable lectures
1917 2018-12-06 20:52:43 はい、ヨロシクです(￣▽￣)ゞ
1918 2018-12-06 20:52:37 Grassyass

1921 2018-12-06 20:52:07 Felt the same way many times. A large chunk of GM is owned by the Oil Companies. It’s a partnership.
1922 2018-12-06 20:51:56 things i had to explain to my uncle this week:
-difference between the terms transgender and homosexuality 
-difference between a wax based color pencil and oil based pencil
-how artists get nominated for grammys
1923 2018-12-06 20:51:50 my look this winter for my hair is just Oily bc if I don’t leave the house without slathering almond and vitamin e oil on my scalp it’s OV
1924 2018-12-06 20:51:43 1 day left to protect the #rainforest, #orangutans, and #palmoil workers from greedy companies like @Indofood! RT to tell @RSPOtweets, the global palm oil body, to vote to stop certifying destructive palm oil in its new Principles and Criteria #RSPO #RT16
1925 2018-12-06 20:51:42 Good question. Like turning an oil tanker. 
1926 2018-12-06 20:51:42 おめでとうございます
楽しみですね
本日もヨロピンコです(´⊙ω⊙`)
1927 2018-12-06 20:51:40 .... how many tax dollars are used in the oil industries. Taxes pay for their subsidies.... which are over 30 Billion!!! Taxes pay for the roads and the upkeep of them. Taxes pay for the oil spills and the clean up. Taxes sometimes even pay for cleaning up the sites that.... 2/
1928 2018-12-06 20:51:38 A troll maggot is the one who see reality but chooses to ignore it. What do I mean? Look at the economy,  border security, GDP, oil boom & soon Roe v Wade to be overturned. You will ignore all this right? Or is it Obama's policies? who is a troll maggot now?
1929 2018-12-06 20:51:32 #DumbReasonsNotToComeHome my house is 50 degrees because I pay 280 for oil every other week.
1930 2018-12-06 20:51:18 Make sure to get y'all oil changed today because ain't nobody up in this mf
1931 2018-12-06 20:51:15 The whitest thing I’ve ever done? i have been to an “Essential Oil Meeting,” run by a white suburban mom named Sheri... they made wine jokes
1932 2018-12-06 20:50:59 Still more expensive than it should be though.

We are in an oil glut and price/barrel is, or should be, at a recent low point. So why isn't gas?

A few years ago, when oil was still scarcer, we were seeing prices under $2.
1933 2018-12-06 20:50:56 Olehenriksen has a cleanser called find your balance, it’s an oil control cleanser and it’s so good!

1935 2018-12-06 20:50:47 I agree Premier Notley has grown in to a formidible defender of oil and gas. 

But it's Kenney's job to point out where she can do better.  The decision to give up Gateway, EE plus trade carbon pricing for TMX has not aged well for one instance. 

Nothing male or female about it.
1936 2018-12-06 20:50:41 I got this from a wild hedgehog spike.. docs havent been able to identify what the hell it is. But antibiotics have failed. Fingers crossed coconut oil is as great as everyone says it is.
1937 2018-12-06 20:50:40 They would've been staring up at my oil pan.
1938 2018-12-06 20:50:32 She’s the wife of an oil executive.
1939 2018-12-06 20:50:31 sooo ... why do you think Iran is supposedly a "terrorist nation"?

("then the money from trade with those countries"  I replied to this in a different post.  Iran is making money bc trump granted everyone waivers to continue to buy their oil.)
1940 2018-12-06 20:50:28 As oil prices tumble - wondering when gas prices at pumps will drop even a little bit.

That’s rhetorical folks.
1941 2018-12-06 20:50:22 On @CNBCClosingBell at 410pm talking oil —What should Opec do?
1942 2018-12-06 20:50:14 産油国はOILが出るので産業が要らない。
喰わせる為に産業を模索する構造。つまり、国民は無駄飯喰らい。
実際のところ、兵隊として使い潰すしか国民の使い道が無い。
という構造。
フランスの場合は産業に寄与しないのに権利だけは主張される。
1943 2018-12-06 20:50:12 yes.But transition have to be managed with robust foreign policy,which means convincing oil rich nations to transform their economy as well.which appears to be a difficult task.(dictatorships or broken democracies)
1944 2018-12-06 20:50:03 Yikes! Nope. Try peppermint oil, and brushing lips with the toothbrush to plump naturally. Or even a little bite rather than this desperate $$$ nonsense and abuse to self.
1945 2018-12-06 20:50:01 roasted with chili oil or sriracha, i taste nothing but spicy, umami deliciousness
1946 2018-12-06 20:49:57 No. I mean black oil from the kernels.
1947 2018-12-06 20:49:35 The US Achieves Energy Independence, Becomes Net Oil Exporter For First Time
 
The United States became a net exporter of crude and refined products for the first time on record last week.
1948 2018-12-06 20:49:34 Pimples 
- Apply tea tree oil diluted with water to the pimple 

- Yes to tomatoes cleanser 

- Aloe Vera gel
1949 2018-12-06 20:49:27 Like turning iron wire into musical steel string. Was there olive oil? (E8 Fromage)
1950 2018-12-06 20:49:24 I really want to try oil painting at some point. Like, I personally don't enjoy trad. art as much as I do dig. art, but oil painting looks so fun and I rlly wanna try it :')
1951 2018-12-06 20:49:17 Lashes and brows 
- Castor oil (apply to top of your lash line)

- Coconut oil (apply to your eyelashes and eyebrows with a small brush) 

- You can add vitamin E to either to speed up the process 

- Don’t forget to wash the oils off in the morning
1952 2018-12-06 20:49:12 Fine, thanks. Harvests are a bit hit and miss these days, but that’s dry farming coupled with climate change .... just gotta get used to it eh?!!  All the best to you and yours. 
1953 2018-12-06 20:49:11 @JustinTrudeau I sympathize with Alberta; I know the import of oil/ gas to our economy and lifestyle BUT with only 12 years left, it's time to go after the 100 industries that do 70%+ of pollution. We need an aggressive action plan for 0 carbon by 2030.  Survival depends on it.
1954 2018-12-06 20:49:04 部屋とワイシャツとオイル
1955 2018-12-06 20:48:50 Gasoline is truly amazing/useful stuff, we just glutted ourselves on it since the invention of the engine.  Oil doesn't need to be stopped, just respected for its consequences and used when NEEDED.  And the world would be a better place if the US had no need of Middle East oil.
1956 2018-12-06 20:48:48 Olive &amp; almond oil are rich in essential fatty acids which help strengthen dry &amp; cracked nails
1957 2018-12-06 20:48:35 Pusi Cat no be Tiger, ororo no be crude oil, Monkey no be chimpazee false life, fake life  vanity. Cut your coat to fit your bodyoo...   @adekunlegold #work on repeat!
1958 2018-12-06 20:48:34 Because he knows what everybody else knows. Fossil fuels are a dying biz that is killing the planet. We need to wind it down by 2030. No pipelines, remove subsidies, give big oil the
$ 4 000 000 000.00 cleanup bill. It's over. Face reality.
1959 2018-12-06 20:48:31 Got my baby an oil change and car wash today, we feeling brand new 
1960 2018-12-06 20:48:27 Them know where the oil gone, it never walk away. And if people like me and you stole it we would be locked up.
1961 2018-12-06 20:48:04 I'll say it louder for the people in the back

OIL  DOESN'T  HAVE  TO  BE  ALBERTA'S  ONLY  INDUSTRY
1962 2018-12-06 20:48:03 ‘finding the money for the oil heating…we’re going to need a refill before Christmas’
We were just saying today we’ve reached December only having had to put the CH on twice…
1963 2018-12-06 20:48:01 Why do we import, if we have so much to export?  We just like going through the steps or something.  Just keep our oil here.
1964 2018-12-06 20:47:56 Are you sure its not iya basira akara oil
1965 2018-12-06 20:47:56 With the industry starting to evolve found a better way for cbd oil just order always use way too much product when make
1966 2018-12-06 20:47:55 Why aren’t you up in arms and pressuring Federal government to replace Saudi oil with Canadian oil - thought you were pro environment and against those who persecute LGBTQ and women. 

Think about how stupid out position is
1967 2018-12-06 20:47:51 Compromise?. 

Pfffft ahahahahahahah. . 
Wait, This Presidency?..

1969 2018-12-06 20:47:23 That the Jews were wandering in the desert and only had enough oil for cooking and lighting lamps with them for 1 day but it lasted 8 days.
1970 2018-12-06 20:47:15 With olive oil by far the best and the most tasty
1971 2018-12-06 20:47:15 Oil change and Replacing rotors
1972 2018-12-06 20:47:10 She's taking oil money
1973 2018-12-06 20:47:01 All these are just excuses to kee sanctions in place. History tells us that we are in for a long haul with these sanctions in place.
 Crime.. Land reform
Haiti .. Slave revolt
Libya .. Oil industry revolution
Cuba .. Communism
1974 2018-12-06 20:47:00 It makes sense that you buy a hybrid when you’re in bed with big oil and Chevy electric

本日もヨロシクお願いしまーす
何だか寝ちゃいましたけど、温泉当たったみたいでしたべしさんが教えてくれました(^o^)
1977 2018-12-06 20:46:32 Gabon is Africa's sixth largest crude oil producer.
1978 2018-12-06 20:46:31 Rapeseed oil is actually excellent & @rapeseedoilfans is local 
1979 2018-12-06 20:46:14 Check your Transmission oil today.
1980 2018-12-06 20:46:01 @realDonaldTrump’s not so good about correlations, is he? That big fat #sciencebrain musta been too busy opening gas and oil fields and endangering all those pesky species. #DowJones
1981 2018-12-06 20:46:00 Or less subsidies to big oil, less money to war, less tax breaks to the wealthy, less $$ to Israel, just to name a few.
1982 2018-12-06 20:45:53 yassss girl! i also have CBD/THC/ essential oil bath bombs & bath salts 
1983 2018-12-06 20:45:48 Soybean oil, chili cans and …. shoeboxes!? Just one more way El Chapo secreted his cocaine into the U.S. (The shoe box brand was Robert Wayne Footwear, by the way. And, yes, some shoe boxes did in fact contain shoes.)
1984 2018-12-06 20:45:47 Mix 1/3 cup huenos rancheros with 1/3 cup kiwi. Add Olive Oil. Cut with butter. Serve a la mode
1985 2018-12-06 20:45:46 Wizkid is that bomb anytime... But I can't really say this guy was talking 'bout weezy here...

It kinda sound edited or misconstrued....

True or not though, Weezy and OBO are our greatest export right now after crude oil..
1986 2018-12-06 20:45:38 I woulda been better off drinking motor oil
1987 2018-12-06 20:45:35 @OANN EVERY barrel of oil EXPORTED from the U.S.A. is a barrel NOT AVAILABLE to future Americans and future American business.  WHY ARE WE EXPORTING OUR FUTURE WEALTH? @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
1988 2018-12-06 20:45:27 He ended the Cold War. Raised awareness for education. And held onto a strong economy his whole term. Oh and ran the CIA before that. I’ll take him over nobama any day. A man who raised taxes to pay for a failed healthcare system and banned oil drilling. Shut up
1989 2018-12-06 20:45:24 we smoked a f at doobie with the loudest THC oil on it smoke up
1990 2018-12-06 20:45:24 The oil industry has set aside more land for nature than any other industry in America
1991 2018-12-06 20:45:23 PDVSA Is Said to Have 3 Refineries Down, Runs at 15% Capacity
Only 2 out of 5 PDVSA oil refineries are processing oil Thursday, amid breakdowns, lack of chemicals and as the Venezuelan oil company prioritizes crude oil exports to pay debts

BBG #OOTT
1992 2018-12-06 20:45:20 Yes, and it will be boreal forest again once they are finished. Open pit mining like this is becoming an artifact of the past. There are now more efficient ways of getting to the oil. Once the cogent projects are done the land will be reclaimed.
1993 2018-12-06 20:45:16 A real purveyor of snake oil. Good choice.
1994 2018-12-06 20:45:15 テストは爆死で！
1995 2018-12-06 20:45:15 We won't care about oil after GND . . . .  Many side benefits to that, obviously.
1996 2018-12-06 20:45:10 The defense is “no, the donations came from individual C-suite employees, not the oil companies themselves” because nobody had ever heard of bundling
1997 2018-12-06 20:45:07 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1998 2018-12-06 20:45:07 The oil. You can mix both and apply to problematic areas

2004 2018-12-06 20:44:42 The giant gave a mid-slumber yawn, he was too deep in sleep to notice the oil being rubbed onto his skin.

But even if he was awake, he probably wouldn’t mind..

2007 2018-12-06 20:44:35 Ok sensible woman, if all I've said is false how did you come at your judgment or accusations since you're not a witch or hv some supernatural powers.
2008 2018-12-06 20:44:22 those waivers (meaning Iran is still selling oil and still able to make money from that) were granted to keep oil price from skyrocketing

(THAT's why trump keeps touting oil prices: trying to paper over the Iran oil waivers - and yet, no inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities)
2009 2018-12-06 20:44:17 (great minds think alike)
I saw a nice presentation on IEA WEO, & from what I understood/recall, to meet oil demand in New Policy Scenarios in 2030, US would have to increase oil supply by a factor 8-10 & would be 2x Saudi Arabia! (correct @Laura_Cozzi_?)
2010 2018-12-06 20:44:16 @ThomasDeLauer question:  been breaking my fast with MCT oil...only the first week using it. Should I start my day with a Tbsp of MCT Oil when I'm not on my intermittent fasting days?
2011 2018-12-06 20:44:13 Definition of tone deaf:

5 massive reports about the impacts of global warming. The severity and its current toll. Worldwide attention.

United States: Unwind gas and oil drilling regulations. Lessen carbon emission standards. Lets make the world more polluted.
2012 2018-12-06 20:44:13 I did few weeks ago, just started recently. My order just arrived today
2013 2018-12-06 20:44:09 you can say many things about the first gulf war but ultimately we stopped iraq from continuing their imperialist efforts to control oil in the middle east. we didn't even try regime change we just left and made sure Kuwait was safe
2014 2018-12-06 20:44:07 The American public wants off of fossil fuels - Koch gas oil coal are not going to let go until they’ve ravaged every inch of this country and its wildlife because they don’t give a rats ass about anybody but the mighty dollar and we re all going to pay  with our lives
2015 2018-12-06 20:44:04 There will be plenty of more oil. Don’t you worry!
2016 2018-12-06 20:43:57 I became shocked n lost @  tha same particular Moment

2020 2018-12-06 20:43:18 Had leave won in 2014, would you be prepared to say the same about the SNP and their oil money claims? Yes or No will do.
P.s - if you say No, you're a hypocrite.
2021 2018-12-06 20:43:10 You're not even uploading them, I wouldn't know before now
2022 2018-12-06 20:43:04 You've had me thrown in twitty prison 2x now because I pointed out facts pertaining to Trump, Putin's oil & Rex Tillerson--facts about why trump is really in debt with them... yet you got butthurt and reported me as a terrorist. Entitled Brat!
2023 2018-12-06 20:43:04 I'm more interested in your choice of ``motor oil'' as the unlikely pizza topping. How did you come up this? What would Riles have chosen? (I'm thinking marbles). Or how about Jim Murray? These are important, writerly questions.
2024 2018-12-06 20:43:00 Stocks climbed from their lows heading into the close of trading, led by gains in tech shares! The S&P 500 remained in negative territory with crude #oil on persistent concern that the rate of global economic growth has peaked at the same time central banks scale back stimulus!
2025 2018-12-06 20:42:47 my car for the past like 5 days has been shocking me EVERYTIME i close my door it shocks me and i think that’s my cars way of saying go change my oil you dumb bitch
2026 2018-12-06 20:42:34 PS: I just read your Gradence fic "The Blind Boy (c. 1925, oil on canvas) and it absolutely blew me away. So amazing!
2027 2018-12-06 20:42:31 Buhari, Atiku, will all be gone one day but the shame and ridicule you're bringing upon this country with your propagandas will come back to haunt you after creating bad image of the country in the international community.
You'll loose big opportunities due to ur foolishness
2028 2018-12-06 20:42:25 Hey Jonny Boy it’s OIL SANDS

So you are okay importing Saudi oil on massive diesel tankers across the ocean to fill your car?
2029 2018-12-06 20:42:15 Snake oil sales.
2030 2018-12-06 20:42:13 I am getting oil paints soon and I'm sooooo excited because then I can be one with Bob Ross when I paint with his videos
2031 2018-12-06 20:42:11 Who pays for tax breaks to corps? Who pays for war? Who pays for subsidies to oil companies? Who pays for bank bailouts?
2032 2018-12-06 20:42:10 i hope ur workin on that deep condition and hot oil treatment bby 
2033 2018-12-06 20:42:08 BTW OPEC recognizes 1/3rd drop in prices of crude OIL...
THIS is not noted by @UKenyatta.

How DOES it translate to KENYA?
Bhang head has furiously tweeted his incompetence the past two days to camouflage such major developments in the world market.

 He has spoken YOUTH THIEVES
2034 2018-12-06 20:41:59 Happy to help :-) You know car mechanics were called 'grease monkeys'? A dirty job, a struggle to get black oil out of hands and nails before a date. Driving a big showy car (even an old one) that their skill made possible, was a status symbol & drew in the girls.

2037 2018-12-06 20:41:52 Well if you put oil in it, it’s definitely a paratha :D
2038 2018-12-06 20:41:51 oil pan, youre done. oh im about to take a sloppy sloppy oil shower
2039 2018-12-06 20:41:30 Lol  Yeah, my Mac could do with a compressor plugging in to give it a kick up the posterior! 
2040 2018-12-06 20:41:29 Someone tell me do a hot oil treatment or deep conditioning

2042 2018-12-06 20:40:51 You're a fool to mention me and tribalism in the same sentence.

Saw your name and think what? You can't even reason well. What has your name or tribe got to do with my comment?
2043 2018-12-06 20:40:50 Don’t forget to ask for the green onion oil
2044 2018-12-06 20:40:45 Not holiday, but baby shower present for #2... Le Mer face oil. My colleagues know me so well.
2045 2018-12-06 20:40:36 As an IT professional I know free when I see it, trust me prof. This isn't free. Data mining is the new crude oil and we are about to gift them  an enamorous amount of it.
2046 2018-12-06 20:40:31 My mans did an oil change washed my car and vacuum it and bought some break fluid for it hehe I’m so spoiled 
2047 2018-12-06 20:40:22 Don’t be their obstacle. Be their oil

お気をつけて...
2053 2018-12-06 20:39:17 Cut all trade ties; oil can be gotten via Qatar and other OPEC nations. Get SA out of business and curb their diplomatic access and their free reign in US. Keep in mind SA caused 9/11..and NOTHING was done against SA then.
2054 2018-12-06 20:39:15 okay drag me  i’ll take that spoonful on coconut oil! 
2055 2018-12-06 20:39:15 You are wrong. Hydro is insanely destructive. Solar is not constant and the amount of mining we would have to do to to build batteries for vehicles is far more destructive. Oil is not used for power except in vehicles in any amount that matters.
2056 2018-12-06 20:39:13 Real problem is new technology to extract light oil from tight shaley reservoirs. No one wants our bitumen. So, build another upgrader in Alberta, and a pipeline to Churchill. Tankers can break sea ice year round. Displace foreign oil from Montreal and Saint John refineries.
2057 2018-12-06 20:39:13 America had the opportunity to lead the globe on a renaissance of solar expansion though the administration chose to side with big oil another amazing future lost for America Sad times!
2058 2018-12-06 20:39:02 @benjanun_s OH OH I've been meaning to say thank you. Both the oil cleanser and the lip mask you recced are AMAZING. But yeah, I'll be using that lip thing for the next decade, holy crap.
2059 2018-12-06 20:38:54 Sierra Oil efectivamente es propiedad de Salinas de Gortari y prestanombres y además tiene activos en todo PEMEX
2060 2018-12-06 20:38:25 Instead of toasting it....little bit of olive oil in the oven....tastier
2061 2018-12-06 20:38:24 ADAM's the ultimate score, kid. No more grifts. No more scams. A monopoly on ADAM makes Standard Oil look like the Piggly Wiggly.
2062 2018-12-06 20:38:22 We have more than enough oil that is less expensive to get at and transport onshore in the country. He may open it up for bids, but at these prices few may bite rhe bait.
2063 2018-12-06 20:38:21 Oil sludge industry harpy.
2064 2018-12-06 20:38:12 partially correct - just 15 of the biggest ships emit more of the noxious oxides  and sulphur than all the world’s cars put together>
Ships use heavy oil which contain high amount of sulhure unlike gasoline. 
>
though ships are the most efficient ( compared to truck , trains.. )
2065 2018-12-06 20:38:04 Mr Leblanc, the Canadian economy includes the oil issue and plant closures that were not on the original agenda as an example, how can that not address the Canadian economy. @fordnation will not owe me an explanation I voted for him and trust his judgement on this matter.
2066 2018-12-06 20:38:02 Lol do you even know me or what I stand for? Why do you always look at things from a tribalistic perspective, so you just saw my name and assumed.
Well you're not better off than what you're preaching against.
Go get who to argue with, bye.
2067 2018-12-06 20:37:58 Nah i feel that my skinny ass throws coconut oil in everything but these thick mfs don’t be knowing how many calories they’re adding 
2068 2018-12-06 20:37:46 There should be a hannukah porno about the coconut oil that lasted 8 days
2069 2018-12-06 20:37:42 Now why am I suspicious that oil and gas wells are a lot better for animal habitats and birds in particular than sprawling windmill farms and solar panels?
2070 2018-12-06 20:37:34 East hastings is drug riddle shit hole. 
Ottawa GM factory shutting down 
Oil and gas in Alberta almost done for 
Farming is way to expensive to get into 
Fishing in east coast is almost wiped out 
We can' t look after the people that are here 
This is one of the 10 ? I asked
2071 2018-12-06 20:37:33 Tea tree oil is an essential oil like the ones she used.
2072 2018-12-06 20:37:33 Murphy Brown, meet Murphy Oil...
2073 2018-12-06 20:37:30 2. ICYMI, the rest of Canada seems to be doing quite fine.

Perhaps the rest of us are learning that AB oil doesn't contribute as much to the lives of avg Cdns as AB mythology has, for decades, claimed.

That would be really scary for AB; to lose its hostage/whipping boy.
2074 2018-12-06 20:37:30 That’s about 2.5 miles by 2.5 miles by 2.5 miles volume of oil.
2075 2018-12-06 20:37:25 i’m so fucking depressed i’m almost in tears sitting in bergstrom while getting the oil changed because why not
2076 2018-12-06 20:37:21 How does building more pipelines and investing in the oil sector help save the environment? If I sign this petition will the Alberta NDP stop acting completely counterintuitive to the message you're trying to send here?
2077 2018-12-06 20:37:19 We will witness a dilemmatic  episode, 1.let MBS alone, what will happen is internal royal conflict in the struggle for power.2.allowing MBS to remain in power, then we'll see a figure of a dictator who has lost reputation.3. the world still needs oil& gas supply stability.
2078 2018-12-06 20:36:59 Christmas dinner gonna be spicy when I ask uncle Nigel where the oil at
2079 2018-12-06 20:36:51 Just where exactly are his policies creating job losses #bedwettingweakAndy ? I’m positive you’ll whine oil patch. So here’s the deal dummy. Oil?up n down like a brides pajamas. No mystery.And in 10 years you didn’t build a mm of pipeline to tidewater. Where are the other losses?
2080 2018-12-06 20:36:48 Add oil to a fire.
2081 2018-12-06 20:36:42 Recently stopped using palm oil based products, after being made aware of the impact. If you need making aware that leaving animals in the cold is cruel you're extremely silly. I'll think twice about donating again if this is their strategy. Not to mention its a flawed experiment
2082 2018-12-06 20:36:37 Here costco adds fish oil to milk :-)
2083 2018-12-06 20:36:35 You hadn't won one at all till after 2008 and UAE bought your club. An actual (oil rich) nation.
2084 2018-12-06 20:36:33 I literally marinate in coconut oil b
2085 2018-12-06 20:36:30 Use coconut oil and apply it with a old mascara wand ... I don’t get extensions I just want long natural thick lashes and it really works for me!! 
2086 2018-12-06 20:36:28 Can someone tell Kenney that there are other sectors of the economy & other investments to consider  - not just oil ! we know that has has to bow down to big oil for campaign contributions, but don't ignore the rest of us entirely !
2087 2018-12-06 20:36:27 Because the US & UK want this war for oil.

2089 2018-12-06 20:36:23 Insight is key. Can we all just realize that oil companies are haywire tools, not our masters.
2090 2018-12-06 20:36:22 Question: would u put olive oil on your face.. or canola oil? No? Ok then why tf are u guys putting coconut oil on your face??? I just don’t understand
2091 2018-12-06 20:36:20 Why does my anxiety go through the roof before I go to get an oil change
2092 2018-12-06 20:36:18 "Aw...Lord Asmodeus is so cute when he sleeps."

Damon sneaks around the back of the throne, peeking over the top with a playful grin. He pulls a small vial of oil from his pocket. A little incubus secret.

"Just a bit of this on his skin. To give his dreams a little spice..."
2093 2018-12-06 20:36:08 The article didn’t mention tea tree oil once tho
2094 2018-12-06 20:36:08 The only product that is saving my whole existence so far this winter is coconut oil. My goodness, I look like a fucking grease ball and I love it. 
2095 2018-12-06 20:35:57 I’m so sick of this assault on everything but $$$$$$$$$$ for gas oil and coal
2096 2018-12-06 20:35:51 .... which was also cozying up to Chadian dictator Deby to tap into the country's oil.
2097 2018-12-06 20:35:49 @JKCorden I showed to the Palm Tree Oil ad to the whole 8th grade in my school consisting over a 100 students + plus the teachers. This was part if my Greenpeace presentation concerning the protection of our nature. My friends cried. I cried.
2098 2018-12-06 20:35:48 It's a mystery as to why the # 1 reson don't get hired is being unlikable in their interview or public persona...
2099 2018-12-06 20:35:42 I enjoyed fox news coverage of how he was a self made man and moved to Texas to make it on his own. Being from a rich family, going to yale as a legacy and the $3 million his dad and uncle gave him to start oil drilling may have helped a bit. Not taking anything away, just lol
2100 2018-12-06 20:35:31 Yeah I posted the data so it could be analyzed. Grabbed someone at random. Their job title seems rather pedestrian. The size of their donation ($2,700) is not. They have over a decade working for the same oil company. Same devotion to the industry there as an exec.
2101 2018-12-06 20:35:29 Record lows for oil stocks  @Edward__Brett
2102 2018-12-06 20:35:28 I`ll ask you now June
1) Wouold scots be better off with 100% of oil revenues or the 8% we get now?

2) Do you think scots are wrong to want to run thier own country?

Clown shoes off

2105 2018-12-06 20:35:16 Workers can donate to whomever; in fact, oil executives are allowed to, as well. But it's worth asking what it was about Beto's policies that those oil executives found appealing.
2106 2018-12-06 20:35:08 What material goods are you referring too? Oil and natural gas? Or Energy? Because if it's oil and gas, you're looking to the past and inturn the same mistakes and impact to the environment. If its energy look to the future and realize that renewables will have less consequences.
2107 2018-12-06 20:35:04 Sure he did--like half the people actually read past the headline of his tweet. They were individual contributions. When you contribute online, you must list your employer so if you're some IT guy sitting at a desk at and oil company, your contribution will record as oil company.
2108 2018-12-06 20:34:55 One time my mom bought incense oil from Luckys Market thinking that you make teas with it.... I caught her in the kitchen drinking a whole cup of “tranquillity” and I’m still not over it.
2109 2018-12-06 20:34:45 Well, I was right there with Standing Rock.  And I don't limit myself to debates on aviation .  In many ways oil, as a substance that exists on/in the planet, is fine and has been around longer than we have trapped in sand/rock.  The dynamic is we keep setting this crap on fire
2110 2018-12-06 20:34:42 He’s a self-aggrandising profiteer. Just another breed of snake oil salesman.
2111 2018-12-06 20:34:38 Girl go get it and try. 
Remember make sure it’s clean. Then with a Q-tip rub the tea tree oil on the outside and inside.
2112 2018-12-06 20:34:27 They’re branding themselves. If they make one small breakthrough they can gain subconscious advertisement and have the market advantage. “Those people invest profit in solar...” Tack on the fact that oil companies are under massive scrutiny for their product and to say that their

2114 2018-12-06 20:34:15 Being in charge of Alberta oil seems to make any Premier crabby, arrogant and dismissive of others. 
Like King Ralph.

Wonder who the Greens are running in the AB provincial election.
2115 2018-12-06 20:34:14 USGS identifies largest continuous oil and gas resource potential ever
Estimates include 46.3 billion barrels of oil, 281 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and 20 billion barrels of natural gas liquids in Texas and New Mexico's Wolfcamp Shale and Bone Spring Formation
2116 2018-12-06 20:34:12 I love the French Lavender Massage oil!
2117 2018-12-06 20:34:10 Not just it. I mix in cinnamon, palm kernel oil, coconut oil, and honey. Sometimes, I add glycerine.
2118 2018-12-06 20:34:07 rub peppermint oil just below my nostrils
2119 2018-12-06 20:34:05 Ok! I had three doctors, one guy on an oil rig and a prince just from talking about it — it’s madness!!! Wow! I’m still laughing though. You’re awesome Trish! Hope you are well!@TrishSuter
2120 2018-12-06 20:34:03 Ok
2121 2018-12-06 20:34:02 #1 old vehicles run like shit when you don’t get an oil change when you’re supposed to. So the oil change makes it get fast, more quickly. 

#2 an expresso in my coffee makes my slow ass add a pep in my step AND there is this DEMON rooster at my house that I run from.
2122 2018-12-06 20:33:57 Don't preach that one to me at all.
I didn't see you defend Evans when he was paraded.
2123 2018-12-06 20:33:54 If dinosaurs become fossils and fossils become oil and oil becomes plastic... are plastic dinosaurs made from real dinosaurs?

2125 2018-12-06 20:33:51 So Violent protests and burning RCMP is democracy? 2013 Oil exploration and yet want to be part of Pipeline?
2126 2018-12-06 20:33:34 Oil IS NOT DEPLETING!
That is another Liberal leftist progressive socialist LIE!
YOUVE BEEN LIED TO! THE EARTH GENERATES THE OIL IT NEEDS!
From the KKK to Welfare plantation mind setting
The Liberal leftist progressive socialist continue to fool people manmade Global Warming LIE!
2127 2018-12-06 20:33:30 I've had so many patients leave my pharmacy fuming because I either refuse to carry the latest snake oil or because I won't recommend unnecessary supplements.
2128 2018-12-06 20:33:08 You just said you NEED a man for the simplest thing ever, so that mean you can't even change oil & filter or the tires

2130 2018-12-06 20:33:01 LYING muslims like rana ayyub have no respect at all...THEY LIE THRU THEIR TEETH FOR OIL money
The only reason these jihadis are not  bombed /jailed like in US or middle east becoz they are living in india among Hindu civilizations,why cant she live kashmir/naxal area?
2131 2018-12-06 20:32:51 Ha. Ya reply wouldn’t have included a lie ( under federal investigation ) and an clear opinion if it wasn’t.  BUT anyway 

Time heals all , except the pain in the mother’s heart who lost a son or daughter in an oil war.  Keep that in mind next time grandpa gives Michelle a mint.
2132 2018-12-06 20:32:50 Saudis, Kashoggi, oil, it's all about money
2133 2018-12-06 20:32:40 The writing's on the wall. Every new battery cell manufactured reduces daily petroleum demand by 35 ml. Tesla currently manufactures 50/second. They'll be up to 2,000/second by 2023.

EVs reduce daily oil demand by 250,000 already. 
We need #gigafactories not pipelines.
2134 2018-12-06 20:32:35 And he is STILL ALIVE? Lower him into a boiling vat of hot oil..
2135 2018-12-06 20:32:26 Very interesting to listen to. Particularly when this was mentioned that "...........with Congress about to go after MBS because of Mr. Khashoggi's murder, MBS needs TRUMP to protect him, & in return MBS won't..... " unsettle oil markets. It's all a tangled web
2136 2018-12-06 20:32:21 even Pompeo, Mattis, and Haspel said Iran was complying.

the international inspectors of the other six countries said so as well.

sooo ... having NO inspections is better?

btw, trump granted waivers to literally every country that wanted to continue buying Iran's oil.
2137 2018-12-06 20:32:14 While our infrastructure deteriorates further, @realDonaldTrump demands a stupid wall. While private enterprise grows solar and wind power, @POTUS gives (nobody wants) coal subsidies & kills our wildlife to bottom out the oil mkt. And as for Tariffs ... FUCK YOU 3 times, tRump!
2138 2018-12-06 20:32:06 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
2139 2018-12-06 20:32:01 The original Texas oil boom changed this country to global power, this discovery is larger.
2140 2018-12-06 20:31:58 Valvoline usually has a coupon online for a $20 oil change and they always top all your fluids
2141 2018-12-06 20:31:50 please don't also forget The Japan Self-Defence Forces.
2142 2018-12-06 20:31:48 Excellent Reza. Pretty obvious that open has become irrelevant these days as they can no longer prevent oil prices from sliding.
2143 2018-12-06 20:31:44 Yes, global warming is happening! And of course we as humans have helped it along. However,  the earth itself does go thru natural changes! If you want to slow it down, which is basically impossible!!! Take on big oil, and all the huge plants that have caused it! I can go on!!
2144 2018-12-06 20:31:44 Oil truck tipped over and caught on fire
2145 2018-12-06 20:31:42 Great job ..buttt please drain that oil n use it for the next pot of eru you want to cook .

2147 2018-12-06 20:31:19 No. The black oil from the palm kernel.
2148 2018-12-06 20:31:14 I'm with ya @cyber727. I was making a point that this idiot in the WH has very little to do with oil prices or the stock market. 
2149 2018-12-06 20:31:14 Now, as I watch the sunrise.
Ah, the smell of oil, the morning light.
There's but one shadow cast on the asphalt.
2150 2018-12-06 20:31:07 You say that as if we have a choice. Read what you said. You literally suggested we just stop drilling for oil because it’s bad for the environment despite the entire world being dependent upon it because we don’t have an alternative. You obviously don’t think before you speak.
2151 2018-12-06 20:31:05 People who work in oil&gas  - live in Texas.  More than 400,000 jobs in Texas are oil and gas jobs and that doesn’t include tangentially related jobs. No one in Texas will get elected being anti oil&gas industry but if they were really supporting him - he shoulda had about 80M
2152 2018-12-06 20:31:03 Oil pulling has actually helped my gums get healthier. Thanks @AmandaC88164578 for the coconut oil :)
2153 2018-12-06 20:30:58 So I got an oil change that supposably last 10000 miles

2159 2018-12-06 20:30:31 Charged me $40 for an oil change, didn’t rotate my tires, didn’t top off any fluids AND tried to sell me nee tires. FOH.

2165 2018-12-06 20:29:46 SpeeDee oil change...well, it’s not speedy
2166 2018-12-06 20:29:41 Until your gov't allow oil #pipelines to be completed in a timely manner, there will NOT be rail capacity for all the commodities we need to ship - by allowing the false premise of #ClimateChange inform ALL your policy decisions, you are destroying lives and livelihoods.
2167 2018-12-06 20:29:35 I think this tweet shows your bias quite well  Could you not argue the opposite? that in a period with emerging markets crashing, oil crashing, S&P breaking down etc,#USD has still not been able to rally to new highs?! What do you think will trigger a move higher? 
2168 2018-12-06 20:29:32 Russia could easily strike a deal to gain access to Libya's oil resources in exchange for helping the Libyans.
2169 2018-12-06 20:29:30 None of the above, although I considered doing it in a curry style. In the end I just roasted the chopped BNS with white onion, 1 red pepper and the magic bit:
Garlic butter and soy sauce (with a little olive oil to stop the butter burning
Blitzed the result and heated with water
2170 2018-12-06 20:29:25 Eh mana
2171 2018-12-06 20:29:12 1/2 Our research shows a significant increase in the amount of federal lands offered for oil and gas development in the current administration. But when these federal lands are leased for bargain bin prices, taxpayers lose out…
2172 2018-12-06 20:29:11 Literally the only one here and they still manage to take a hour to change my oil 
2173 2018-12-06 20:29:11 the colours look so soft and dream like, i adore it! looks like it could be oil paint
2174 2018-12-06 20:29:10 Drop a tablespoon of that coconut oil in your gah’damn coffee and tell me you don’t feel like you belong in front of Health Magazine
2175 2018-12-06 20:29:00 Kana nan har yanxu?
2176 2018-12-06 20:28:54 Here's the thing, every CDN dollar short outside Canada is looking at the debt bubble, not the oil price.  Everyone forgets RE sector represents way more of the economy than resources now. Not to say it won't have an impact though
2177 2018-12-06 20:28:46 like Oil Company CEOs are agitating for liberals.. you're certainly an obedient and malleable little BBro aren’t you

2180 2018-12-06 20:28:31 Totally, I believe he has done 1 of his big signings granting oil and gas rights to drill offshore. I expect it's only a matter of time before there is a pollution problems because of this action
Fracking I gather is now responsible for contaminating drinking water.
Not Trump's!
2181 2018-12-06 20:28:26 One thing my oil friends taught me is, in addition to diffusing, you can make a linen spray. Fill a sprayer bottle with witch hazel and add e. oils of choice- a few drops a piece. I often mix lavender, cedarwood, vanilla and spray the furniture and bed, recline, relax
2182 2018-12-06 20:28:22 add rosehip oil to your routine (ik u can get it at whole foods but amazon too and it’s not too much) i use rosehip oil before i apply moisturizer (after i wash my face!) and i have been loving it.
2183 2018-12-06 20:28:20 "They are telling the Marxists, eco-alarmists, dupes, & garden variety political cowards that they will not put up with this bunk about climate change requiring drastic reductions in carbon emissions and therefore justifying absurdly high fuel prices as world oil price declines."
2184 2018-12-06 20:28:19 I want to do a hot oil striptease under the name Valvolina.
2185 2018-12-06 20:28:15 Further: we’re seeing plenty of jobs outside of oil and gas, particularly in automation and IT, and not enough skilled people to fill them.

2187 2018-12-06 20:28:03 Oil supply lines is the next hurdle if they survive 90 days of Trump pressure.
2188 2018-12-06 20:27:57 Coming to the end of the 1st Week of December:
Oil still down
Gold rising - more fear and uncertainty.
US Bond market still high
$USD still low.
China A50 at critical support 10,800
Japan 225 just above critical support 21,000.
Defensive positions only.

2189 2018-12-06 20:27:55 For once I'd agree with him.... very high on the Agenda must be oil resources.  This is the biggest issue facing Canadians now and for some time due to our inability to move our resources to more than just the US.  It's costing us millions every day!
2190 2018-12-06 20:27:52 Beto apparently promises to be just as corrupt as Obama when it comes to fighting pointless wars, and protecting the banks and big oil.
2191 2018-12-06 20:27:51 Why did you post oil & gas in isolation rather than all categories? Why did you conflate donation by individuals with donation by industry? Don’t treat us like idiots with your disingenuous “just the facts” as if you didn’t put those facts in a frame.
2192 2018-12-06 20:27:50 Авв, спасибо, я прямо смущена
2193 2018-12-06 20:27:46 I like the desserts...Hanukkah is all about fried foods (oil) . So I love jelly donuts "Sufganiyot" 
2194 2018-12-06 20:27:43 They get it. 
They’re just paid for their opinion & votes by big oil.

2204 2018-12-06 20:27:03 @gregjames just wondered if you’d rent yourself out to help me on the spanner’s next year at one of my sons British championship motorbike racing rounds?Involves taking orders,making tea and sarnies getting dirty changing wheels, oil, fuel and gearing! Also keeping me calm!.
2205 2018-12-06 20:27:00 Did anyone in poer specifically say for oil drilling? Or is this more run of the mill CNN gaslighting?
2206 2018-12-06 20:26:59 My old standby is farfale with broccoli, capers, and parmesan in olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, capers and a sprinkle of fresh corriander. Can’t go wrong.
2207 2018-12-06 20:26:58 Why all those details? I don't care what kind of bra Shanann was wearing. Nor what kind of sex #chriswatts likes. Nor the way in which he dumped his daughters in the oil tanks. Disgusting  . 
#shanannwatts #nicholkessinger
2208 2018-12-06 20:26:46 Why not have a round of #mastercheftheprofessionals where they have to cook with just a single person's Food Bank parcel? No truffle oil, no half a huge fish chucked away after a fillet's cut, no confits, tonka beans or veloutes. AND if you take too long, the electric goes off.
2209 2018-12-06 20:26:33 They like BJs and oil
2210 2018-12-06 20:26:30 Even though I get paid tomorrow, I’m just over this week. I got 0.94 in my account. I don’t have my debit card cause I lost it last week. I have about 169 miles until my tank is empty and 30% of oil left in my car. I’m over it 
2211 2018-12-06 20:26:29 Oil is Canada’s economy
2212 2018-12-06 20:26:25 4 billion people live in relative energy poverty as poorer economies evolve demand for energy will require all forms of energy. Unless of course you think they should remain poor. 
Demand for oil and all other energy grows every year and projections show this will continue.
2213 2018-12-06 20:26:18 Again, lower oil prices do not benefit the US. Who's cranking the handle of that ancient adding machine?
2214 2018-12-06 20:26:13 I've made an example of Arab countries, what do they sell besides oil? Do you eat oil or they trade with it? Zimbabwe is fertile and they can also export beef amd  sheep if they're serious. they also have minerals and good wildlife for tourism. It's up to them.
2215 2018-12-06 20:26:09 Exactly the point I was trying to make with my olive oil business, only her case is a better example.
Devalued pound, people with money to buy, regardless of record levels of employment (more like record levels of slavery). Brexit will only make this many times worse

2220 2018-12-06 20:25:42 Little anecdote for liberals/centrists.

In June of 1979, showing courage and foresight Jimmy Carter put 32 solar panels on the roof of the WH. The oil ind. was livid. Reagan tore the panels down in 1986 + defunded clean energy. Did Clinton restore the panels? No. Did Obama? No.

2228 2018-12-06 20:25:08 I’m not a stock guru. My opinion is not only the trade war and oil and other talked about worries. I think the democrats with their constant treats for when the congress starts new and the delayed Russian investigations also constant and impeachment talk has hurt a lot !!!!!!!!!!

That'll be oil, infused with Dill

And they let you treat people????

2232 2018-12-06 20:25:00 The cake and no part is least. All action shows callous scamming. Someone who would think it ok to have a party with 1000usd cake would naturally mismanagement the oil
2233 2018-12-06 20:24:57 There is far more known oil reserves today than there was 50, 25, 10 years ago. I guess we can all safely say that Paul Erlich is as wrong as AlGore!
2234 2018-12-06 20:24:56 Thank you for reaching out. Though most of our programming can be found on Lucas Oil Racing TV, this series will unfortunately not be offered.
2235 2018-12-06 20:24:54 Using CDN oil instead of us gaining jobs and tax revenue.

Brent crude fell by US$1.50 or 2.4% to US$60.06 a barrel and the US Nymex price fell by US$1.40 or 2.6% to US$51.49 a barrel.

2237 2018-12-06 20:24:49 Really awkward having a box of tissue nearby without it being next to a bottle of baby oil.
2238 2018-12-06 20:24:44 Damn why all these oil barrels in my yard
2239 2018-12-06 20:24:34 I don't give a crap about climate change. I like EVs for the potential savings in cost per mile. Plus a large part of what is keeping gas prices low is the fear oil companies have of causing a surge in EV sales. Solar farms are great too. It's free electricity.
2240 2018-12-06 20:24:31 Started another new job today. I’m gonna have oil stained fingernails for the rest of my life.
2241 2018-12-06 20:24:17 Legend, cheers man! Loving Midnight oil, it’s mint. Xx
2242 2018-12-06 20:24:11 wow I was suppose to get my oil changed 3,000 miles ago... sorry dad
2243 2018-12-06 20:24:06 You answer my question by posing another.
Would you sacrifice your own child for this?
I don't want anyone's child to die but you will not get any govt to stop using oil overnight. People would riot and there would be unnecessary deaths.
2244 2018-12-06 20:24:02 better to see this now before Trump kills all the whales and fisheries with his seismic oil exploration.
2245 2018-12-06 20:24:01 When Mt saint Helen blow up there was a cloud of fall out more than 2,000 miles and it affected the weather for sometime .   Also in the Oceans there are cracks in the bottom that oil leaks out as well as hot liquid. Try and control that problem.
2246 2018-12-06 20:23:58 We're glad you asked, Eric! All travelers must comply w/ federal law on transporting cannabis infused products, such as CBD oil, on board a flight. Our officers are required to notify law enforcement officers if they discover these products while screening your property.
2247 2018-12-06 20:23:43 oil cleanser recs for oily skin?
2248 2018-12-06 20:23:39 Maybe, the western world learn to stop causing wars in Middle East and Africa for oil, and witch hunting. If an Arab leader or African leader doesn’t want to work with you leave in peace. Bullying Assad, killing Gaddafi and Sadam didn’t bring any democracy just bring backwards
2249 2018-12-06 20:23:36  OIL Markets

  OPEC has been unable to come to an agreement on price cuts - so far just a minimal cut in production. Hence the price of oil per barrel has fallen to $51.00 a barrel. We shall wait and see if Vlad. Putin steps in today to save OPEC.
2250 2018-12-06 20:23:34 เกลียดนะที่ทำแบบนี้
2251 2018-12-06 20:23:16 Blackrock sostiene gran parte de esos bonos. Muy corrupto ese fondo y no le gustó perder Sierra oil & Gas
2252 2018-12-06 20:23:08 And you know those “employees” of the oil and gas industries are expected to make those contributions by their employers.
2253 2018-12-06 20:23:06 Many forget about the oil coming up off the road at the beginning of a storm.  Lots of wrecks.

We're due for ice and snow starting tomorrow, and I can't wait to count the AWD vehicles in the ditches and medians.  Just cuz you can move easier, doesn't mean you can stop easier.
2254 2018-12-06 20:22:56 #OPEC been cutting on production which is affecting the price of oil on the world market and negativitely affecting developing economies. The move by #Qatar to leave OPEC shud be recommended we need reforms

2257 2018-12-06 20:22:29 Stop flaunting your cbd oil, I truly do not care, that shit ain’t gunna get me high and you know that.
2258 2018-12-06 20:22:14 They can always Sell it like they did this year, and make billions of rands. It's up to them what they do with the money afterwards. Arab middle east countries, make 90% of of their GDP from oil, and they have arid land and deserts. They still manage to be free of poverty
2259 2018-12-06 20:22:12 You are a purveyor of snake oil.
2260 2018-12-06 20:22:05 Yes, he should have followed the proper process- like you guys did when you shut down the oil & gas industry in Taranaki.
2261 2018-12-06 20:22:04 nothing will ever be as relaxing to me as nuxe oil scent. damn hit me with that good shit.
2262 2018-12-06 20:22:03 If Trudeau hadn’t ‘killed’ the eastern oil pipeline, Canada could have made oil shipments to Europe to further erode Russian oil revenues that Putin used to intimidate &  attack the Ukraine.  This has been a National Security & economic blunder all in one.
2263 2018-12-06 20:21:59 I love college, where I can get high off of CBD oil all day EVERY DAY.
2264 2018-12-06 20:21:55 Hmmm how do you forget to put an oil cap on after an oil change???

It doesn't have to come from oil.
2266 2018-12-06 20:21:38 My God! BO is literally taking credit for the current energy boom. He tried to stop oil and coal production! Even his supporters know this is a whopper of a lie.
2267 2018-12-06 20:21:22 Roast peppers (I also save the pepper oil to cook with again later), broccoli, halloumi, garlic, whatever random vegetables there are to hand
2268 2018-12-06 20:21:21 And the green maniacs scream about "big oil cash"....
2269 2018-12-06 20:21:09 Wow, are you triggered? These are oil industry execs we're talking about, not the grubs who work in the trenches.
2270 2018-12-06 20:21:02 You should try Palm oil and cornflakes

2273 2018-12-06 20:20:35 Stock market lost 600 points back in October wiping out all 2018 Gaines.

It dropped 800 points two days ago and suffered another steep decline today as a result of Trump’s trade war and oil prices. 

There is now talk of a recession.

Tell me again about the best economy ever.
2274 2018-12-06 20:20:32 S&P -1%, DAX -3.5%!

2275 2018-12-06 20:20:28 Seems to counter the effort to keep them from reaching U.S soil and offering themselves up to BP and a softening of defenses.
2276 2018-12-06 20:20:16 I tried it today for the first time without the oil and it was amazing
2277 2018-12-06 20:20:16 I don’t even use tea tree oil anymore. It’s TOO potent
2278 2018-12-06 20:20:15 No. Just poke holes and pour some olive oil in your hand and rub the potato. It will make the skin more crispy. You can put some pepper on it after the olive oil too
2279 2018-12-06 20:19:56 A dab of lavender or eucalyptus essential oil on your temples
2280 2018-12-06 20:19:51 Exclusive / What happened in OPEC today?

No ministers spoke after #OPEC's meeting today. I will summarize what I found:

1. There are five scenarios for reducing the production of oil. If Russians accept each one tomorrow , that scenario will be implemented./1 #OOTT #oil
2281 2018-12-06 20:19:47 The best advice I can give you is bring a case of lube oil your going to be needing it
2282 2018-12-06 20:19:46 That oil Inna Condom
Is It Power oil Or King Oil??
2283 2018-12-06 20:19:46 How many Pet Engine boys dey work for oil companies? Stats no smile.

2285 2018-12-06 20:19:43 Dry, dull hair? Tried a bit of coconut oil or Shea butter? Oil pack over night may help. too (olive oil, jojoba?).
2286 2018-12-06 20:19:31 Because politics has become all about selling unworkable ideas to an uninformed electorate.

There really isn't any value is being honest. (The irony of course is that @jeremycorbyn promised "straight talking politics" and has been one of the most effective snake oil salespeople)
2287 2018-12-06 20:19:28 Trump administration plans to reduce protected #habitat of sage #grouse in order to boost #oil exploration. The plan would make 9 million acres available for #drilling. #conservation #nature
2288 2018-12-06 20:19:27 If we would have taken the oil, you wouldn't have ISIS.
2289 2018-12-06 20:19:25 But the US doesn't own that oil.... 

that's were the story gets complicated.
2290 2018-12-06 20:19:21 @LizClaman I don’t remember politicians whining about all the oil company layoffs when oil prices were tanking.  Why all the fuss about GM?
2291 2018-12-06 20:19:17 Never in history has so much carbohydrate, seed oil and chemical toxins been ingested.

2301 2018-12-06 20:18:23 I don’t think smearing Beto as taking oil money when he very obviously is not is valid criticism.
2302 2018-12-06 20:18:22 I got this face oil trio thingy from herbivore to try...and then I checked the prices on the full sized bottles. Good lord.
2303 2018-12-06 20:18:09 Sirota used broad language to lead ppl to think Beto took money from oil/gas lobbyists. He certainly didn’t mean for it to bolster Beto’s potential candidacy. Since he equivocated in the process, it certainly is an attack.
2304 2018-12-06 20:18:05 LOL.  Me the other day:  mailed a letter, checked my oil, got a quart of oil, drank a soda, ate a cheeseburger, and got gasoline and filled car with oil.  All at @KwikTrip

2307 2018-12-06 20:17:54 English speakers will never know the struggle of wearing shirts with English words you don't understand I spent half of my childhood in a yellow sweatshirt with 'hot oil' written on it bitch hot oil what
2308 2018-12-06 20:17:48 I'm amused by Chandler's naiveté, that he could turn in a script in just over a week. I suppose a seasoned pro could do that while burning the midnight oil, but it takes a long time to burnish a screenplay (Linda S., my co-writer for a comedy we banged out, would attest to that).
2309 2018-12-06 20:17:37 1. Yes. It's also in the 2015 article I linked about how Bush decreased oil production, and Obama turned it up so high that he began the president with the most US oil production in the history of the US. You're never going to get through to these people they're useless stooges.

2313 2018-12-06 20:17:17 I fr cant open this jar of coconut oil.... maybe we do need men
2314 2018-12-06 20:16:58 That is the 1,000 yr storms we’re having .  I don’t like polluting any thing but you have to realize that the earth is a fantastic place it can renew itself. If this didn’t happen we would be walking with oil soaked shoes etc

2323 2018-12-06 20:16:02 If Paulwell found oil loses at Petrojam at .66, above the standard of .4, and brought it down to .31 when he left office, what more could he have done?

2327 2018-12-06 20:15:24 ABOUT CBD OIL... 

1. I don’t know what it is. 

2. I have heard about it and am curious what it is. 

3. I take it every day and love it! 

Which one are you, post 1, 2 or 3?

2329 2018-12-06 20:15:22 Sustainable palm oil is far better for the environment and animals than dairy fats or other vegetable oils. Please research and reconsider your stance on this.
2330 2018-12-06 20:15:12 I say that oil and gas belongs to all Americans not those who claim mineral rights! There are some things that should not be owned by capitalists or big land owners.

2335 2018-12-06 20:14:41 Well I’m glad we agree that the invasion of Iraq was based on lies, by a president & vp with ties to the oil industry. But it’s not as if Trump is *against* lying or corrupt self-dealing - or killing people for that matter. The enemy of my enemy is not my friend here.
2336 2018-12-06 20:14:41 Awareness against domestic violence.
2337 2018-12-06 20:14:38 And as soon as Maduro was re-elected and attempted to pull Venezuela out of Chavez' bad oil dealings. The opposition attempted a coup, rioting for "social democracy". So Maduro militarized the gov, and Obama imposed sanctions on Maduro. The Marxist opposition wants a US-led war.
2338 2018-12-06 20:14:30 Q: Given the drop in price of oil, how does it affect the number of jobs and candidates?

Michelle: We are seeing an influx of job seekers but if you can/want to be flexible about which industry you’re employed in, it can help in your job search.

2345 2018-12-06 20:13:54 No, we need solar energy instead of oil.
2346 2018-12-06 20:13:48 Because it meant that he subordinated all ethnicities of the USSR to the Russians, and all member-countries of the Comintern to himself. Stalin was an anti-Semite and an ultra-nationalist who sold oil to Mussolini after his invasion of Ethiopia and to Hitler after Nazi-Sov Pact.
2347 2018-12-06 20:13:45 @BitiTendai is now above the law? @JeffFlake is now the authority over Zimbabwe's judiciary? No wonder they murdered Gaddafi just so they weaken a major oil producer. They really want a zombie in our government with executive power. Open your eyes they need some Zim mineral or so

2349 2018-12-06 20:13:41 I took my car in just to get new tires and an oil change and now that it needs repairs it’s gonna cost me $600> RIP Christmas 
2350 2018-12-06 20:13:36 Historians will view the trump/Russia/saudi administration as essentially a fossil fuels coup, pushed by rapidly-falling price of renewables. They KNOW they're soon entering an extraction $ death spiral and must get out last $ of value before the oil/coal/gas bubble price bursts.
2351 2018-12-06 20:13:36 I've seen similar phrases on unionist tweets on my comments, too. The whole 'UK continental shelf' thing is their latest angle when it comes to oil. Particularly noticeable since the large oil field discovery announcement.

Isn't it something that when Market is doing great Trump & @WhiteHouse take credit, but when it's crashing as a direct result of Trump's Trade War w/China per Wall Street experts, they won't take credit.
2357 2018-12-06 20:13:13 None of the oil money is clean, and personally I'm not OK with ANY donations over like $200 from anybody.
2358 2018-12-06 20:13:13 The glut has nothing to do with Alberta production. We’re tiny compared to other oil producing nations.
2359 2018-12-06 20:13:06 Yeah I disagree with the opinion but there is nothing wrong with this tone. Sirota's implication that Beto is in the pocket of Big Oil though is ridiculous
2360 2018-12-06 20:12:56 Я подумала, что это смайл. Значит я долбаёб?
2361 2018-12-06 20:12:46 I'm kin with the Hannukah's impossibly small amount of oil that burned for 8 days
2362 2018-12-06 20:12:41 Iraq was staged for oil. A war that has cost us millions and millions of dollars, many lives .... all because of oil. There’s always a bigger picture and Bush ain’t it!
2363 2018-12-06 20:12:40 Olive Oil on the skin
2364 2018-12-06 20:12:40 See, this is another incorrect thing going around. They weren't all small donations; I've previously posted a spreadsheet showing dozens of donations of $2,000 and up from people who work in oil and gas.
2365 2018-12-06 20:12:36 In 2009 when oil was 125 a barrel and natural gas was 12.00 a btu.  This 135 million project was wrapped up into a maps 3 vote.  But hey let’s hang our hat on that
2366 2018-12-06 20:12:35 Also on Lucas Oil TV?
2367 2018-12-06 20:12:19 Don’t you just love these politicians who can see 20 years and 50 years. I’ve been hearing this garbage all my life. It’s always 10 years out. I remember in ‘74 when we were going to be out of oil by 2000. And the population explosion was going to wipe out the world by the ‘90’s
2368 2018-12-06 20:12:10 Why are people pretending like cbd oil is getting them high? Lol.
2369 2018-12-06 20:12:04 If you use fish oil for lube I hear it responds to commands.
2370 2018-12-06 20:12:01 And let's not forget that any private person who donated to Beto's campaign, and works in the oil industry as so many in Texas do, counts as an oil industry contribution. Very misleading!
2371 2018-12-06 20:12:00 Because he’s a snake oil salesman from Queens
2372 2018-12-06 20:11:58 Almond oil and Avocado 
2373 2018-12-06 20:11:53 New fender,
New tires (2),
New brakes,
New engine bs,
New headlight,
New inspection,
New oil change, 
New car wash

= a lot of money...

The feeling of having my baby back:

=Priceless...
2374 2018-12-06 20:11:41 Cut the fluff!!   your regulations on the oil patch are equally as disastrous as the low oil differential (that your pipeline ban helped with).  Your Government is mostly to blame! If you want to help CALL AN ELECTION.
2375 2018-12-06 20:11:29 I'm just getting back into art after dropping out ages ago so I'm not the best :/ but I do oil painting and pencil drawing hehe
2376 2018-12-06 20:11:25 I started using aveeno shower oil n my skin's so soft but issa waste bc namjoon ain't here to touch it uwu
2377 2018-12-06 20:11:17 Peppermint oil on temples
2378 2018-12-06 20:11:05 thinkin about rubbing my feet with coconut oil
2379 2018-12-06 20:11:02 I am finding it hard to buy bread that is not made with Palm Oil,is yours baked with it?
2380 2018-12-06 20:10:59 Thanks, Prof. Tells me exactly what I need to know. I'd seen a video about taking coconut oil to reverse AMD. Seems many of our 'modern diseases' have a common ancestor.
2381 2018-12-06 20:10:57 Oil price? and there's no handing over money it's taking a little less
2382 2018-12-06 20:10:52 D’Andra comes off desperate and inauthentic. I just find her difficult to watch. And mama Dee making her money by selling face cream on Christian tv, well isn’t that just the 21st century snake oil salesperson. Not a fan.
2383 2018-12-06 20:10:47 Ameen ameen
2384 2018-12-06 20:10:43 Someone should tell her that there are a lot of Democrats in NJ and NY who work on wall street or related fields and may not appreciate attacks on their livelihood. Same as Democrats from oil states with gratuitous attacks on their livelihood.
2385 2018-12-06 20:10:41 Hi Sims, we’re sorry to hear you had a bad customer service experience with us. Please contact our Instant Oil Customer Care team at 1-800-327-8242 or via email at customercare@valvoline.com. They can get more information and provide assistance.
2386 2018-12-06 20:10:33 Lets just walk away from the entire middle east, we don't need their oil or their terrorists, we have enough of both in this country.
2387 2018-12-06 20:10:26 Biggy Biggy Riggy.  Glad he's home on STL to be closer to Anthony but I'd be equally happy if he was back in Oil town.
2388 2018-12-06 20:10:24 @Pillsbury is it true that not all of your brownie mixes contain palm oil? such as chocolate fudge
2389 2018-12-06 20:10:19 …ぐぅ
2390 2018-12-06 20:10:19 You grate them fine, fry onions and garlic in olive oil, add the beets, let it simmer, some liquid (wine/water), salt&pepper and then you can add the cooked pasta. Top it with old pecorino or fresh goat cheese and some herbs if you like like parsley. Easy, tasty and so pretty!
2391 2018-12-06 20:10:06  And an unapologetic defense of both which requires an understanding that oil companies and health insurance companies are bad and should be put out of business.
2392 2018-12-06 20:10:04 放送当時日本にいなくてリアルタイム視聴出来なかったのが非常に悔やまれますが、これでようやくリベンジ出来る！
2393 2018-12-06 20:10:03 え、君顎あるの？顎ってやっぱりどこかで買うの？僕顎持ってないんだけど。
2394 2018-12-06 20:09:58 The man lied about oil,lied about fishing.
He makes his money from both and knows independent Scotland will affect his earnings.
Don't believe him if he claims to be Ian Wood.
Lies lies lies.
2395 2018-12-06 20:09:58 Someone drank my housemates honey flavored bourbon and replaced it with vegetable oil  I’m acc crying 
2396 2018-12-06 20:09:54 @GoldmanSachs remind us of your oil forecast from a couple weeks ago
2397 2018-12-06 20:09:42 اغلب الناس لايعلمون انك تملك شركة heritage oil للبترول وطبعا الشركه هذي التي تملكها تمتلك حقول نفط في ليبيا بعد اسقاطكم القذافي وسرقة بترول ليبيا
2398 2018-12-06 20:09:39 Y'all are wild on this app 

My moma too sell palm oil
2399 2018-12-06 20:09:35 the world is so funny,if the government finddiamond or oil in your backyard,it’s the government property,but if the find a drug it’s mean yours. ain’t this shit ?
2400 2018-12-06 20:09:28 He was running. IN. TEXAS. Texas is very proud of its oil and gas jobs. He’s the first one to ever discuss shifting Texas’ economy to clean energy (see what I linked you above). What’s your solution, dissolve oil and gas companies completely?
2401 2018-12-06 20:09:24 If the truck is owned by u and I something will get done. More 60% is owned and control by dangote and some oil companies
2402 2018-12-06 20:09:15 How helpful is CBD oil for sleep vs getting high?
2403 2018-12-06 20:09:00 Prop up a puppet state with oil, what’s there to see?
2404 2018-12-06 20:08:56 @AshleyPangborn  war crimes over oil in sudan - just great
2405 2018-12-06 20:08:44 @realDonaldTrump Mr President, on slight note you are pushing OPEC to pump more oil and bring prices lower while on the other side , pls also work towards to stop the giant trading houses to stop or abstain from manipulating the market. #Glencore must use learn business ethics.

2407 2018-12-06 20:08:20 ‘Credible action on climate is essential to maintain the support of Canadians for oil and gas production’. 

Time to let go of this dream. It’s nearly 2019. It didn’t work. Probably was never going to.
2408 2018-12-06 20:08:17 More oom times are still in the works. America is just starting its energy resources being exploited. We can build LNG Plants and ship NG to Europe and Asia. We actually have a Saudi Arabia amount of oil under the Metro SoCal basin and Pacific coast now that we have deep drilling
2409 2018-12-06 20:08:08 I agree he wasn’t attacking Beto, just pointing out a surprising detail. But it’s disingenuous to lump contributions from individuals together with corporate donations as “the oil and gas industry”.
2410 2018-12-06 20:07:55 Getting an oil change on my own for the first time, wow
2411 2018-12-06 20:07:53 ALL THOSE STUPID CROWS have been FIXING oil prices
2412 2018-12-06 20:07:50 Oil is an Icon @oliverxfrancis
2413 2018-12-06 20:07:49 Also explains why IQ45 picked peroxided, nipped & tucked bump on a log and climate dufus, Kelly Craft, oil tycoon squeeze, to be the new Ambassador to Canada. I know he’s jealous of Canada, just didn’t realize he hated us that much too. Thanks for nothing, America. 
2414 2018-12-06 20:07:39 I asked the librarian where the books on oil and other lubricants were... she said they are in the non-friction section
2415 2018-12-06 20:07:38 they have like natural “insulation” thick feathers and oil that allows them to float unaffected otherwise they’d fly south
2416 2018-12-06 20:07:35 Bingo... Low oil prices means low oil stock prices...

@Sarge986 @EnergyPhilFlynn @LizClaman
2417 2018-12-06 20:07:33 As long as they have the big oil output they're gonna remain in power not to mention their subservient manners for their masters. Too oil rich (and obedient) to dump.
2418 2018-12-06 20:07:23 I asked the librarian where the books on oil and other lubricants were... she said they are in the non-friction section
2419 2018-12-06 20:07:18 how retarded do you have to be to sell Canadian oil at discounted prices and buy foreign oil for a premium @JustinTrudeau? STOP hurting the canadian economy!
2420 2018-12-06 20:07:18 My point is that your scepticism is needed elsewhere. Like how are they going to clean up the oil sands in Alberta? How is it that these companies can pollute the land, air and water for free? What are we going to do with the oil reserves that can’t be burned?
2421 2018-12-06 20:07:18 I was just getting into the markets and living in Tampa, in 2008 oil was still 100+, a lot of complaints about high price of oil. Then came 2009 and honestly the news reflected the situation but still majority of people kept working, stores were open etc... just keep powering
2422 2018-12-06 20:07:10 Evo Morales dijo :—-De la llave para dentro el petróleo es nuestro y de la llave para fuera es de Chedron, Oil, o de las transnacionales
2423 2018-12-06 20:07:02 They. Have. Oil. Simple as that.
2424 2018-12-06 20:06:58 Holy fucking CBD oil guuuise
2425 2018-12-06 20:06:57 A wonder if petrojam sold the oil barrels n use money buy the cake?
2426 2018-12-06 20:06:52 If the government finds oil/diamond  in ur backyard is government property but if they finds drugs or rhino horn its yours and u re absofucklutely going down for it! Why the f?
2427 2018-12-06 20:06:48 Not energy or oil/gas expert but I have heard Nigeria supplies Ghana gas. Ghana has excess power or surplus but I am learning power supply in Nigeria is so erratic - I don't get that part very well. 

Lord have mercy!!! 

#Nigeria

#Africa — feeling curious
2428 2018-12-06 20:06:43 Sure. But oil and gas companies are both destroying the planet and funding bullshit climate change denialism.
2429 2018-12-06 20:06:40 Oil and grime
Toxic muck
I want that dude
Up in my butt
2430 2018-12-06 20:06:31 Okay, that will almost certainly be enough oil and gas to totally pollute the Earth and probably even Mars too. Interesting that it has been found in the Wolfcamp Shale & Bone Spur Formation.
2431 2018-12-06 20:06:20 Trus dirimu salahkan Jokowi ya blok goblok....
Beban dosa pemerintahan sebelumnya bisa mulai diselesaikan.....
Sanagol, Petro China, chonocco philip, exon oil petroleum ekspansi sampai menghajar Pertamina saat pemerintahan sebelum Jokowo yg jual kontrak kerjasamanya.
2432 2018-12-06 20:06:18 Time to get my oil changed.
2433 2018-12-06 20:06:12 ... Arab oil giants, Russia and the USA will be waiting.
2434 2018-12-06 20:06:11 $5 billion worth of oil unaccounted for under successive PNP & JLP administrations? Paulwell & Wheatley need to be removed from Jamaica's Politics!
2435 2018-12-06 20:06:01 We’re exporting oil because our old refineries are not capable of processing high gravity crude, which is what shale reservoirs produce. They blend as much as they can with low gravity crude, but the rest they have to sell to countries w/modern refineries.

2439 2018-12-06 20:05:42 I just started using it again because I swore it off because of them Smfh. But I mainly use avocado oil more than any other oil that I use.
2440 2018-12-06 20:05:31 They'd get far more cash if they spruiked for big oil.  You really think it's about money?
2441 2018-12-06 20:05:30 Relationships and oil field 2 things that’ll never go together. 
2442 2018-12-06 20:05:28 That’s where free markets, innovation, and capital formation get you. We took a bunch of hard rock and figured out how to blast oil out of it.
2443 2018-12-06 20:05:22 I just started watching Netflix while waiting on an oil change and it started playing in my car bc the Bluetooth was connected :)))
2444 2018-12-06 20:05:15 me: *knows evoo is supposed to mean "extra virgin olive oil"*
me: eeevooooo
2445 2018-12-06 20:05:14 The United States last week exported more crude oil and fuel than  it imported for the first time on record, according to data released on  Thursday, the same day OPEC ended a meeting without a decision to curb  global output to balance out the historic surge in U.S. supply.
2446 2018-12-06 20:05:14 OPEC reached a preliminary pact in Vienna to cut oil output, but specific volumes yet to be decided: report
2447 2018-12-06 20:05:13 You said the Oil was running out. You are a Yoon liar!!!!!!!
2448 2018-12-06 20:05:10 The short memories lasted until Harper used the RCMP as Henchmen and paid thugs like the Nazi SS at Elsipogtog for Oil Companies.  Harpers disregard for democratic process and the Canadian Constitution.
2449 2018-12-06 20:05:04 I’m a dirty artist working the oil fields late at night so I can hopefully live around Malibu one day
2450 2018-12-06 20:05:01 Took him a year oil money to win the league title. Conte spent less and won it in his first. He implemented his in his first year also. It's not easy to say at the top for 30 years, ask Wenger.
2451 2018-12-06 20:04:54 If you're using coconut oil to help with any skin or hair insecurities....you need to message me! 
Why?! Because you're wasting your money + time.
2452 2018-12-06 20:04:28 How about jojoba oil? Is that also terrible for your skin?
2453 2018-12-06 20:04:25 Congratulations to all the rich shithead oil execs
2454 2018-12-06 20:04:19 $APHA Not to put oil on the fire, because I believe there is still value in the company, but Haywood is net selling 878k$ and Cormark 219k$. Top buyer again is CIBC 6M$ net and Merill Lynch. Goldman, TD and Canaccord folks selling.

2457 2018-12-06 20:04:17 You mean the guy who's been bragging about helping out the banks and increasing oil production? The one who set the stage for the nightmare we are in now? Yeah, perfect president.
2458 2018-12-06 20:04:07 .@MikeSonko even when breaking the egg to fry or to make an omelette, you at least put oil & make the pan hot. I think you must make the pan ready to make the omelette, which is to decongest the CBD. If not, you'll have badly done eggs #CBDMatatuBan #NewsGang @citizentvkenya
2459 2018-12-06 20:04:05 uh??? just made a sugar scrub w hemp oil instead of coconut and honestly? five stars dude. the oil absorbed quickly, i don’t feel greasy, the scrub was dry enough to apply standing in front of my sink without making a mess.... i think i just found my new go to

2461 2018-12-06 20:04:04 #RRE have to say I'm amazed back to low 600s. Market cap £80m staggering given production 11,500 boepd, opex $26 pboe, half oil hedged at $68. Fcf will cover major developments (arran) taking production to 18,000 with enough cash set aside to cover decommissioning liabilities.
2462 2018-12-06 20:03:52 I think you meant oil companies, military contractors and Wall Street.
2463 2018-12-06 20:03:52 Using coconut oil is ok for my gallbladder right??? Coconut oil +air fryer =its just like deep frying! :)

2466 2018-12-06 20:03:41 If Russia is behind the French riots over a gas tax, then it's probably because they REALLY don't want carbon taxes. So maybe that's a reason to look at them. Imagine Russia and the Middle East without oil money... I wonder how many wars they'd be waging.
2467 2018-12-06 20:03:39 We need start bunch of wars in Middleeast and destroy oil supply
2468 2018-12-06 20:03:19 Jonny boy...again imported Saudi and US oil not subject to carbon tax. Ya follow or am I still confusing you 
2469 2018-12-06 20:03:18 Dutch Prisoners were tricked into breathing gas in a paper bag. Gas and Motor Oil. And American Paper bags, saved our sanity in the barracks. And we talked about the best books we ever read to stay friends.

2476 2018-12-06 20:02:13 He’s lying he hasn’t gotten an oil change in a year
2477 2018-12-06 20:02:02 "Now we can support Texas being a proud energy leader, in oil and in gas, but also in renewable energy,”

Direct quote.

Claiming he's for working on climate change is like calling someone "a little bit dead."

Milquetoast isn't going to cut it this time. We have 12y.
2478 2018-12-06 20:01:46 The cake and the surprise party are a smoke screen.  It’s not about the cake. It was never about the cake or some fricking party. Billions in oil is missing. A lot of stories swirling about where the oil gone and who build gas station when they’re in power etc. Follow the oil.
2479 2018-12-06 20:01:44 Think the result was oil prices still very wobbly....?
2480 2018-12-06 20:01:42 Eco styler olive oil or?
2481 2018-12-06 20:01:37 Essential oils should be cut with a carrier oil before use on the skin.

2494 2018-12-06 20:00:03 #UKOG let see what happens tomorrow people talking about oil crash
2495 2018-12-06 20:00:01 and also using a moisturizer/conditioner during every wash personally i like the OGX argan oil one bcus it isnt crazy expensive ive also tried the paul mitchell i think its called "super charged" something something which is more expensive and i cant afford lol but if you wanna
2496 2018-12-06 19:59:51 Right now though? These guys are selling very expensive snake oil. The price is only going to cost our indentured service until we drop dead. 

Just look at France.
2497 2018-12-06 19:59:44 We care more about cooking oil and fuel irikushaika. But maybe since tisina mabasa let's see of those people in America don't have jobs like us too
2498 2018-12-06 19:59:44 And when you’re out, put some oil mixed with styling curl lotion (she’s moisture brand) and scrunch it into your wet hair. Don’t brush it or comb, let air dry
2499 2018-12-06 19:59:37 But you import more oil from Canada, Trump's tariffs don't work and his 1% tax cut incentivised companies to leave America. So much winning.....
2500 2018-12-06 19:59:33 It is possible for people to be turned off by his attachment to oil and gas and the general inability to reconcile his previous actions with his policy proposals as a senate candidate, without this all being some kind of 'coup' by Sanders to usurp Beto's momentum.
2501 2018-12-06 19:59:23 Yes, carrots, perfect. Hey if you like smoked oysters got some at Aldi Smoked Oysters in oil and red chili pepper.
2502 2018-12-06 19:59:18 Можно и мне?
2503 2018-12-06 19:59:15 Absolutely tiger balm on the temples.  Also CBD oil  can be applied topically anywhere on your body for pain. Temples too!
2504 2018-12-06 19:59:07 peppermint oil to the temples
2505 2018-12-06 19:59:05 Then he could have watched the whales all be slaughtered for their oil.
2506 2018-12-06 19:59:03 OPEC ministers discussed the oil production cut by 0.9-1.0 mln barrels per day within the Organization’s framework and believe that ten non-OPEC countries should assume a half more of this portion, two sources in OPEC told TASS on Thursday.
2507 2018-12-06 19:59:02 Trump sold you guys snake oil and you bought it 
2508 2018-12-06 19:58:59 Sadly there will be more announcements from oil companies in the near future.
2509 2018-12-06 19:58:57 Based on AG reports missing oil and other discrepancies go back to 2010 I believe
2510 2018-12-06 19:58:48 fuxk my car for needing an oil change rn

2512 2018-12-06 19:58:31 Sometimes called Bianca pizza: Olive oil, garlic, mozz, ricotta, black pepper, NO sauce, hence it being called white pizza. Not a fan of spinach on mine but some people like to be overachievers....soooo good!
2513 2018-12-06 19:58:30 A wider variety of carbon blacks can be produced from oil and that is why most of the carbon black is produced in this way.  If your goal is carbon-free hydrogen, the natural gas route is better.
2514 2018-12-06 19:58:30 @jimcramer do low oil prices help or hurt $FLT? Thanks Jim!
2515 2018-12-06 19:58:25 People I’ve known for twenty years haven’t bothered to check on me after losing the dogs. Men I’ve known purely from watching slather themselves up with fake tan & baby oil & then lying on top of each other for three seconds have went out of their way to check on me. Wrestling 
2516 2018-12-06 19:58:22 Today I glazed a ham at my holiday side gig and now I’m buying motor oil at a Walmart... I’m in the midst of an identity crisis send help
2517 2018-12-06 19:58:11 No but I like using olive oil
2518 2018-12-06 19:58:03 omg Do your job! 
The oil crisis is not even on the agenda and you dont even ask why?  #NoBrainjournalists
2519 2018-12-06 19:57:56 They’re crying ‘Everybody Muslims are terrorists ‘ but their oil is greatand don’t kill cows but are biggest exporters of beef

2523 2018-12-06 19:57:31 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.  Psalms 23:5

2525 2018-12-06 19:57:23 In NY a 30-day supply of CBD oil costs between $200-$400 per month, Jeremy Unruh (PharmaCann rep) says. #VPADay18. He says it's hard to tell how much patients will pay in Virginia until  more details are available.
2526 2018-12-06 19:57:05 Have you checked your oil recently?
2527 2018-12-06 19:57:05 @uym I am USA citizen. Retired from oil and gas industry, living in Mexico. Need help to get my Pakistani citizenship ASAP. Need help.
2528 2018-12-06 19:57:02 {Citation needed}

Her sources are right inline in the text.

He has called the decision between oil and gas and renewable energy sources “a false choice,”

^^ like that.

Is he a member of the the CPC like @RepRaulGrijalva? No,he's part of the centrist caucus. He's been there 6y
2529 2018-12-06 19:57:01 Had reply from my consultant re CBD oil ,even he can't prescribe it ,some of his patients get it off the net .wasn't gonna say anything bout @mypain anymore so I won't be going on or be burden but ,may be useful to know ,right back to hiding xx
2530 2018-12-06 19:56:53 And wars for oil and other minerals
2531 2018-12-06 19:56:47 I need someone to rub my chest. Preferable with oil serious tho #sore
2532 2018-12-06 19:56:45 Just drank Oil Spill by Variant Brewing Company at Variant Brewing Company, stars!
2533 2018-12-06 19:56:38 Doesn't surprise me in the slightest. Norwegian politicans will always say they world welcome the UK into EEA (they need to be diplomatic with their bigger, powerful neighbour that buys lots of oil).

However suspect many significant actors in Norway really don't want us in EEA
2534 2018-12-06 19:56:35 Excellent analogy,  but watch out for your oil fields too.
Westminster has a history of redrawing lines in the sea to suit it's own ends.
2535 2018-12-06 19:56:32 Bio oil
2536 2018-12-06 19:56:32 You need to correct your reporting to provide the context Beto accepted no corporate money. His donations are from individuals who, surprise, work for the largest employers in Texas, the oil industry. Until you fix your mischaracterization, you remain a strident, lying Berner.
2537 2018-12-06 19:56:28 Snake oil salesmen come and go.  The Clintons are done. History. Obama is done. History. Trump can blow his  a few more times and actually accomplish something. So I'll support him as I did THEM. Till he 2 is History. Or I am.
2538 2018-12-06 19:56:28 bio oil! works a charm
2539 2018-12-06 19:56:25 Once you own a car hunny that a start of your problems.If it not oil change then it your Rotors,if it not your rotors  then it engine care, lmao if it not engine care then it your coolant lmao if not that then it your car wipes like wft and all these start @ tax season sis 
2540 2018-12-06 19:56:21 So you oppose Alternative Energy? Do you work for the Oil Cartels?
2541 2018-12-06 19:56:20 Coconut oil is THE SHIT.
2542 2018-12-06 19:56:19 初心者やからコツコツうまくなれば良いと思いますよ～！

格ゲーも動画とかみて基本動作思えてトレーニングモードで練習してから実践って感じですし、スマブラも同じで良いと思います！
2543 2018-12-06 19:56:13 Nothing is more important than donations from big oil!
2544 2018-12-06 19:56:07 They are making deals on our behalf   that's the point and require the UK and indeed other members to impose Tarrifs on what would be cheaper goods from the great outside world in order to finance the "EU project" basically a cartel like OPEC where countries control oil prices.
2545 2018-12-06 19:56:05 Basil oil, pine nuts, and chestnut mushrooms on a bed of spinach leaves. Pasta with chicken and balsamic glaze. Roast red pepper and cherry tomato sauce with pasta tubes. Yum.
2546 2018-12-06 19:55:53 They only exsit with combustion. If you don't smoke weed, you don't take in carcinogens. And you can vape THC or CBD oil without combustion. Not to mention edibles.
2547 2018-12-06 19:55:49 Countries that produce oil certainly do!! And there is quite a number of those. Somebody should explain it to Donny!
2548 2018-12-06 19:55:48 Falling oil prices would directly affect NM royalties and could slow drilling. Indirectly, it could lead to lower GRT collections from industries that depend on oil and gas activities. But I'm also told it's cheaper to drill in the Permian than other parts of the country.
2549 2018-12-06 19:55:45 I know 2 Ladies that have CURED Their Dogs inoperable Cancer with CBD Oil and a few other Natural Resources! Don’t Give Up! You can Beat this! 
2550 2018-12-06 19:55:39 Fuck the oil field, and fuck taxes 
2551 2018-12-06 19:55:34 Try being stuck on an oil rig until Wednesday! Too hyped too early!
2552 2018-12-06 19:55:27 .@LinkedIn I wish I could block specific advertisers, like on Twitter.  I don't need to see oil company propaganda ever.  It leaves a VERY bad taste in my mouth, and the existing feedback options skip "they are literally evil" as a flag type.
2553 2018-12-06 19:55:24 Will this also explain what the Black Oil was and who was in the Red Lodge?
2554 2018-12-06 19:55:20 Existing targets are not even adhered to? According to The International Energy Agency, India's energy demand in the next two decades will double. China will continue as the biggest oil consumer. Consequently global C02 emissions will continue to steadily rise.
2555 2018-12-06 19:55:16 Oil gonna plummet when goaltending reverts to league average.
2556 2018-12-06 19:55:12 I’ve raised the bar and gone from Vapenonce to PotheadVapenonce. 

Have a lash at the high strength CBD oil. All the relaxation without the shit side of weed. 

I hate myself. 

*STANDS*
2557 2018-12-06 19:55:09 Aku sih dulu pernah coba olive oil nya mustika ratu . Buat dijadiin jd pelembab lutut. Dan itu gpp xD
2558 2018-12-06 19:55:07 lts time for ED to look for homegrown solutions. like mining  our resources with countries that give beneficiation. We have lots of valuable minerals like coal oil platinum gases etc. @JeffFlake
2559 2018-12-06 19:55:07 Petroleum is a natural product. It is the essential oil.
2560 2018-12-06 19:55:06 Contemporary critic of Open Societies is more valid. The initial sales pitch is very appealing until you consider mechanisms of implementation, inevitable consequences. 
Communist Manifesto repackaged and rebranded
2561 2018-12-06 19:55:02 Have you tried Peanut Oil?
I'd eat yours just the same, though 
2562 2018-12-06 19:54:55 I was so sure CBD oil would be a miracle cure. I wonder how many writers are insomniac ?
2563 2018-12-06 19:54:55 Is water from “wata” infused with coconut oil?
2564 2018-12-06 19:54:49 The MCT we use is derived from both coconut and palm oil

2567 2018-12-06 19:54:34 No problem just dnt drown it in olive oil
2568 2018-12-06 19:54:30 All I see on peers’ Instagram stories in this stage of life is an obscene amount of personal essential oil pitches and a ridiculous number of pictures of babies
2569 2018-12-06 19:54:29 I lost my amber oil perfume and I’m so sad
2570 2018-12-06 19:54:18 ...at least until oil company lobbyists start crying to you about the fall of their billion dollar bonuses.
2571 2018-12-06 19:54:15 CBD oil on neck, doesn’t have to have thc
2572 2018-12-06 19:54:14 Putin could save the day if he takes @realDonaldTrump lunch money again! He has to be loving this, slapping hands with the Saudis while we tank.  #Oil #OPEC #oilandgas
2573 2018-12-06 19:54:00 The Bottom line is Scotland has poured billions in Oil Revenue right into London and spent in the South East and your Children are been fed from foodbanks and you still voted to be ruled by Westminster. That I will never understand.

2575 2018-12-06 19:53:53 You are right! But be sure it is the "good" peppermint oil.
2576 2018-12-06 19:53:52 I’ll change ya oil for you 
2577 2018-12-06 19:53:50 #OperationCyclone Yay! Let's give Islamic military dictatorship (Pakistan) billions of dollars to arm the most vicious extremist warlords for a few decades. Great idea! /sarc

Also dodgy mixing politics with private oil interests, and some naiveté about worshiping the 'same' God.
2578 2018-12-06 19:53:41 STOP SETTING ALL THE OIL ON FIRE
2579 2018-12-06 19:53:35  Whoa, that's crazy! Someone bought an oil rig and transformed it into a BnB? How many does it accommodate?  #CultureTrav

2581 2018-12-06 19:53:24 I didn’t really measure anything but I made a vegan cream of mushroom with shallots, garlic, olive oil, mushrooms, flour, and almonds milk with salt and pepper to taste then I made a bolognas sauce with faux meat crumbles garlic, onion powder, garlic salt, Italian seasoning
2582 2018-12-06 19:53:14 LOL---he tried to make it look like O'Rourke was taking money from the oil industry but he didn't take corporate or PAC money.
2583 2018-12-06 19:53:14 WHEN the oil well search is on, you’re up Lorrie, just don’t give up the day job whilst we get our act together on this... we might be a bit behind the pace!
2584 2018-12-06 19:53:09 Accelerating the long carbon cycle by liberating carbon sequestered in hydrocarbons not the other way around. 

Though its a simple matter to manufacture hydrocarbons through oil to algae plants.
2585 2018-12-06 19:53:08 This one pass head alone... His cup dey overflow with oil
2586 2018-12-06 19:53:06 Linoleum, 'Lino', derived of linseed oil... My pop was a textiles man, but he didn't know squat about flinging it around a canvas.
2587 2018-12-06 19:53:00 Don’t u love it when you take your car for a routine oil change and they inform you that you need $1,400 in repairs done instead??? Ha.... hahaha... same 
2588 2018-12-06 19:52:59 Dawg how is Sunny D still legally sold in 2018, you’re better off drinking burnt transmission oil
2589 2018-12-06 19:52:58 I’ll even help pay i just don’t wanna sit in the shop n get a oil change or get out the car to pump gas 
2590 2018-12-06 19:52:58 Different grades of oil, limited storage capacity, logistics...
2591 2018-12-06 19:52:57 You can influence a lot if you control oil, have the wealth and leverage those to buy products from foreign countries. No country or political party is exempt. Clinton’s Uranium One deal is an example.
2592 2018-12-06 19:52:55 Walked into the service dept at the car dealership & said “my grandma told me to come down here for an oil change” & the guy says “mrs.martha?” Lol shows how long she’s been doing business with them #buyblackmon
2593 2018-12-06 19:52:54 And of all the people to be virtue- signalling, this douche who is advocating Canada shut down it's oil and gas industry, which will be a disaster for Canada.
2594 2018-12-06 19:52:44 Fresh out the shower then putting baby oil on  , feeling tooo fresh
2595 2018-12-06 19:52:43 Means we WIN twice 

Those low gas prices help the American worker and the Small business. 

Also hurts Iran's radical leaders who use oil profits, to sponsor terrorism.
2596 2018-12-06 19:52:42 Live in Portugal. Sounds very tempting adding a bit of olive oil and fresh parsely
2597 2018-12-06 19:52:41 Lest you don't realize....using tax payer's money to shell down London. is CORRUPTION!...Appointing your Girlfriend  to 3 state boards bcuz of Puss is CORRUPTION... $5 billion of unacccounted OIL under Paulwell & Wheatley is CORRUPTION!
2598 2018-12-06 19:52:29 Trump wants to drill oil in Alaska

2600 2018-12-06 19:52:21 Dammit. I meant oil
2601 2018-12-06 19:52:18 No. There is only one truth. What comes out of the ground, (oil, gas, coal) needs to stay in the ground.
2602 2018-12-06 19:52:05 Thankfully there's #bitcoin ...the energy markets need something that looks worse than oil #grassisalwaysgreener
2603 2018-12-06 19:52:02 Just had the best Brussels sprouts the were cooked in truffle oil and was parm cheese sprinkled on top
2604 2018-12-06 19:51:58 I was referring to the economy, my dude. The oil prices were because of the Saudi's flooding the market in retaliation for American dominance in the oil markets. Take a look at the markets rn and remind me how a tanking DOW and a massive Trade Deficit is winning? Do some research
2605 2018-12-06 19:51:57 You are always welcome
2606 2018-12-06 19:51:41 If you believe in climate change, you will most certainly agree that there should be a carbon tax placed on users of carbon based materials. How would you like to pay $7 per gallon for fuel? How about home heating oil?
2607 2018-12-06 19:51:32 The rules are not clear between the federal and state levels as far as CBD oil is concerned, says @SenDaveMarsden. Virginians need to follow Virginia laws.
2608 2018-12-06 19:51:13 ThNk you bro
2609 2018-12-06 19:51:05  it really will tho. Gone and mix that with some vitamin E oil, grape seed oil, coconut oil, and Rose water and Issa go!
2610 2018-12-06 19:50:58 oh yes im sure hormones have a big impact on it with thyroid and pcos. castor oil has always helped me with growth! i’ve never personally tried onion juice but i know a few ppl who rly swear by it for when they experienced hair loss so it might be worth a shot!
2611 2018-12-06 19:50:58 Stopped smoking  , cause them oil fields been  calling me .. big racks
2612 2018-12-06 19:50:48 also their baked goods taste like food and not sadness with oil
2613 2018-12-06 19:50:47 We mostly import crude oil. Our export is only 18% crude and 82% non-crude oil petroleum. 
We are refiners. And that’s re-fine with me. (Boom. Nailed it.)
2614 2018-12-06 19:50:47 For my peace of mind I refused to check the thread, left for the few Rt on my TL.
I know how I can go from 0-100 real quick
2615 2018-12-06 19:50:41 Kitchen experiment! I made an infused oil with fresh garlic, fresh shallots, red pepper flakes, pepper, and very thinly sliced MEAT STICK. These are garlic meat sticks we picked up at the Cleveland market--think homemade artisan Slim-Jims. (1/2)
2616 2018-12-06 19:50:31 We have 10 years to stave off total ecological collapse. There is no third way out of this. We're going to have to break the power of oil and finance or most of us will either die or live like animals while the rich sit in bunkers on Mars.
2617 2018-12-06 19:50:29 Podcast ad recordings happen:

   the day of show release.
2618 2018-12-06 19:50:28 That is my point exactly his grandfather’s chain of gas stations carried them through the dirty 30s and brought them a vast amount of wealth. Wealth off the back of oil. His family is allowed to prosper from oil, but no one else can.
2619 2018-12-06 19:50:21 Then truly, an ancient evil has come across my household... I will continue to attack with cedarwood oil, moth balls, diatomaceous earth, glue traps and Orange Guard. Maybe this is the hill I die on?!

2624 2018-12-06 19:50:06 Anyone may donate anything to anyone
Must be transparent
Must divulge who donors are
Must divulge amount donated
Must be transparent
This statement should scare GOP:
If Oil industry donates any amount to Republicans then my Banks may donate any amount to Democrats
Fair is fair...

2627 2018-12-06 19:49:51 A 2007 study in the “New England Journal of Medicine” found that when applied topically, tea tree oil and lavender oil—common ingredients in shampoos, lotions, and soaps—can cause “gynecomastia”, an enlargement of the male breast gland because of a hormonal imbalance
2628 2018-12-06 19:49:50 I swear it's like widely known that coconut oil is comedogenic
2629 2018-12-06 19:49:35 If Congress takes action on Saudi Arabia on the Khashoggi death. On an issue that doesn't involve and American citizen. I hope the Saudis shut down all oil production the very next day. That's what I would support them to do and encourage them to do!
2630 2018-12-06 19:49:30 Though seems banks would want to buy low cause obviously oil prices are at a low and trade will increase.... giving rise to currency value #WeAreThePeople
2631 2018-12-06 19:49:25 No it’s an essential oil.
2632 2018-12-06 19:49:24 That one too is insanity at its peak.
2633 2018-12-06 19:49:23 @jkenney now talking about the agenda dispute over the first ministers' conference and the battle to include the oil industry crisis. #ableg #cndpoli
2634 2018-12-06 19:49:23 Sounds like oil is heading towards  $40 WTI. No unity in OPEC. Likely to fall apart.
2635 2018-12-06 19:49:20 @BobRossOfficial I get to make one choice, so I need some help and opinions from people. Start with acrylics to continue to learn with- or just go head first straight into oil and start learning there with Bob? Mind you, I’ve only used watercolors and didn’t really like them.
2636 2018-12-06 19:49:10 @philosphrob tweeted trash implying that Beto took gobs of oil and gas money.  He took contributions from folks who were employed by O&G workers, not O&G PACs.  When I pointed out the inaccuracy of his tweet he blocked me.  Cultists.
2637 2018-12-06 19:49:08 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
2638 2018-12-06 19:49:02 Why
2639 2018-12-06 19:49:01 the only thing I would add is a bunch of hot peppers, like there's these peppers called Mama Lil's, they are canned in oil, and they are one of the greatest things ever. extremely sorry for placing this ad on your post...
2640 2018-12-06 19:48:49 Well a good example would be the apparent conflict of interest regarding licensing of cannabis oil!
2641 2018-12-06 19:48:32 Peppermint oil works even better.
2642 2018-12-06 19:48:27 It has CBD oil in it
2643 2018-12-06 19:48:27 I had an irrational moment when my husband told me to drop my car off at the dealership for an oil change. But in my rational mind it makes perfect sense because the dealership is literally a light up from work.
2644 2018-12-06 19:48:04 Really? How wealthy do you have to be to throw that kind of cash at a cause with a 50/50 chance of going nowhere? Getting rich in the oil biz absolutely does mean undue influence. Dems need to stop this shit if they're serious about climate change. Texas doesn't get a free pass.
2645 2018-12-06 19:48:00 I been in line for an oil change for at least 10-12 songs
2646 2018-12-06 19:47:56 Tea tree oil
2647 2018-12-06 19:47:54 Bio oil
2648 2018-12-06 19:47:53 I quite often do linguine - crab meat, olive oil, parsley, lazy chilli, lemon juice and lemon zest  
2649 2018-12-06 19:47:38 When you start to pick, switch to rubbing with oil.
2650 2018-12-06 19:47:33 Some of their stories are actually funny, while some are disgusting
2651 2018-12-06 19:47:32 And sadly, there's no check mechanism to it, coz everyone needs oil!!!
2652 2018-12-06 19:47:23 I’m in Florida for my grandpas funeral and my bf picked up my dry cleaning, cleaned my car, and got my oil changed while I was gone without me asking I love him.
2653 2018-12-06 19:47:19 I’m taking biotin right now, I haven’t done castor oil no or onion juice! I feel like it’s probably my diet too like a pcos or thyroid thing. But my friend said she used castor oil and it helped her a little bit
2654 2018-12-06 19:47:18 Perfect.
2655 2018-12-06 19:47:16 Well listen, you snooze, you lose. Don't blame me if you can't find your oil well.
2656 2018-12-06 19:47:15 But it was ok to put thousands out of work when you shutdown the cool industry and oil drilling. Your not about the people your about only winning at any cost
2657 2018-12-06 19:47:02 This past February, oil was spilling into the Charleston Waterfront at a rate of 50-400 gallons per month.
2658 2018-12-06 19:46:56 BASTARD FROM HELL: the female form… How is its beauty so great? Each delicate curve slices through me like a Maserati through a wind tunnel. How would I begin to comprehend it? As a painter, it is my enemy

GENIUS: I am going to paint a beautiful mason jar. Oil on canvas. $2000
2659 2018-12-06 19:46:53 Ethiopia  

With no sea ports, no oil, no cocoa and with several civil wars from 1974 to 1990, Ethiopia has emerged as one of the strongest economies in Africa with development constantly on the rise. 
Beautiful Ethiopia

2663 2018-12-06 19:46:38 and by loosing oil dem really meant them thief and n blame it on "spillage"

2665 2018-12-06 19:46:29 Hi @RealDavidJensen .  Im looking into this Chinese oil contract and can’t find that it’s settled in gold.  For this to work, do you need to do a 2 leg trade?  Ie, sell oil, buy gold via 2 separate contracts?
2666 2018-12-06 19:46:22 i'm back.  oil is changing...
2667 2018-12-06 19:46:14 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
2668 2018-12-06 19:46:06 How might falling oil prices, partly due to surging U.S. production, affect Permian Basin activity and New Mexico revenues?
2669 2018-12-06 19:46:01 Oil futures end lower as OPEC postpones an output cut decision to Friday
2670 2018-12-06 19:45:57 -Applies massage oil to said thighs if allowed-
2671 2018-12-06 19:45:50 Honestly feel like we bad a tax break on gas tax and the people that were benefiting from this corruption pay it for us. Can you imagine how much we’ve been paying for missing oil everyday to make up for the losses of some greedy tief??
2672 2018-12-06 19:45:42 have u tried any natural remedies for hair growth? castor oil and (this sounds gross but) onion juice are reeeally good for hair loss
2673 2018-12-06 19:45:33 The average person will not be able to just walk into the dispensaries, Juran says. People will only be able to obtain CBD oil by recommendation from a doctor #vpaday18
2674 2018-12-06 19:45:25 Reason i need a male friend : take my car for oil changes and pump my gas
2675 2018-12-06 19:45:25 They're at best misleading. Those weren't donations from companies, they were from *individuals*. To complain about him getting a lot of donations from people who work in the oil industry is a little ridiculous considering he was running in *TEXAS*
2676 2018-12-06 19:45:23 If they were protesting for the line because of oil shortages etc, it would be different. But their reasoning is they are suffering economically, which not only are many other Albertans but how selfish is it to only think about your wealth in a global time of crisis like this
2677 2018-12-06 19:45:23 What an awful bill.  You don’t even hode your true agenda.  The first item is about oil development and the last is allowing old boats to pollute and not have to modernize.  You are a sad one sided hack and your legacy on rhe environment is awful.  Retire !
2678 2018-12-06 19:45:20 Nope a 1000 cake wasn’t left there and the missing oil gone way back up plus increase in salaries and much more don’t make this about politics.
2679 2018-12-06 19:45:20 I've looked through my tweets. Last interaction was in April, once to recommend Edge of Forever (Live, Die, Repeat), the other to say that accusations of "virtue signalling" were pointless and beside the fact regarding oil investment. Can't see the bit about Coyne.
2680 2018-12-06 19:45:17 USA: "Is that oil?"
2681 2018-12-06 19:45:14 Combine 4 cups Rice with 3 cups Irish stew. Adorn with  Olive Oil. Set aside for 3 days Serve in 3 inch slices
2682 2018-12-06 19:45:14 And talking about poverty having been an oil executive
2683 2018-12-06 19:45:04 I work in the oil industry. We 100% DO want to see higher oil prices.
2684 2018-12-06 19:45:02 100 years of R&D? That R&D stopped when oil became abundant and cheap :P
2685 2018-12-06 19:44:39 Future Husby, i want to give 15k to your adorable parents to buy chicken, rice and groundnut oil for Christmas.. where are you my spice
2686 2018-12-06 19:44:30 Well they need more oil
2687 2018-12-06 19:44:25 Be realistic, Neera.  Beto has accepted too much oil and gas money to get the Democratic nomination.  He'd make an acceptable senator or governor, given that he's about as progressive as you could realistically get in Texas.  Learn to be satisfied with reality.
2688 2018-12-06 19:44:21 @somaiyahh ukhtee
2689 2018-12-06 19:44:20 it's still unbelievable they got a more oily president than boren lol like that dude bled oil and they found someone who drinks it
2690 2018-12-06 19:44:18 Stop solar energy saving the planet because we have shares in oil
2691 2018-12-06 19:44:17 Make use of their troll to push business. Oil dey your head 
2692 2018-12-06 19:44:10 It’s the turf in Lucas oil. It’s complete garbage
2693 2018-12-06 19:44:05 My understanding is that *employees* of oil companies donated personally. Clearly not the same thing. Russia is attempting to divide and conquer once again. We need to be smarter than that. #StrongerTogether #CountryOverParty
2694 2018-12-06 19:43:51 @JustinTrudeau do the right thing stop all arms sales to Saudi Arabia, stop buying Saudi oil and expel the Saudi Ambassador
2695 2018-12-06 19:43:45 The juice infused lip oil is bomb af!
2696 2018-12-06 19:43:33 If you had a carbon tax - you wouldn’t be faced with the issue of low oil prices imo - suppliers get taxed, pass on tax to refiners (increased cost / barrel) - and yes then onto consumers. But benefits oil industry and environmental conversation at the same time
2697 2018-12-06 19:43:32 The United States last week exported more crude oil and fuel than it imported for the first time on record
2698 2018-12-06 19:43:29 Palm oil and water can not mix

2699 2018-12-06 19:43:23 Stupendous!  

And to think that Trump just removed the ban on seismic air gun blasting off the US east coast despite warnings it could kill or injure whales and dolphins.

It hurts so much. We need to stop the maniac & stop the oil companies.

2701 2018-12-06 19:43:15 I regret calling these fakes bro and sis cuz family is supposed to stick together but they separated like oil and water.
2702 2018-12-06 19:43:02 I had to pay $400 for an oil change today and to have my car looked at but then I founded out that I ended my hardest class with an A. Had to take an L to get a blessing.
2703 2018-12-06 19:42:54 Been looking for the Gwyneth Paltrow snake oil but It must be sold out.....
2704 2018-12-06 19:42:52 does it look like opec gives oil a bounce ?
2705 2018-12-06 19:42:47 ughHhh even more now with the oil >.<
2706 2018-12-06 19:42:44 #EVs - #AVs are expected to #transition ICE to #Electric #Drives. Canada had a decision. Invest in #Oil or invest in EVs. Canada chose Oil - $4.5 M Trans Mountain Pipeline acquisition represents about 10% of #GM's capitalization. We would be better-off buying control of GM.
2707 2018-12-06 19:42:41 Ya ever stop for an oil change, only to realize you've barely gone 2000 miles since the last one?

Uh me neither
2708 2018-12-06 19:42:37 If Andrew doesn't make an example of these culprits he can kiss that stupid sign good bye. Hell yall get these monies from with barrels of oil missing and million dollar birthday parties
2709 2018-12-06 19:42:25 Fill your car with 1 jerry can full of water. It’s for the radiator. Also, you need 4 bottles of motor oil.
2710 2018-12-06 19:42:23 Yes, the side with integrity and the side whose "research" was funded by an oil industry PAC.
2711 2018-12-06 19:42:22 Rational and Left are mutually exclusive so this is what you should expect. Bet their dumb enough to think this is over an oil tax too.
2712 2018-12-06 19:41:57 A lot of people use the fake toxic oils sold at general stores. Others warn about direct skin contact. You’re also supposed to dilute it with coconut oil or another base oil unless you’re using it for aromatherapy in a diffuser.
2713 2018-12-06 19:41:57 Man of God’s widow and sons in need of provision, only had small amount of oil.
Instructed to get large empty vessels. Closed door and poured oil into all the
Vessels. She sold oil to pay debts and live
on the rest with her sons...PROVISION
2714 2018-12-06 19:41:56 Agreed, we just can’t.  We rely on technology to continue to help us unlock those additional reserves.  Look at the US shale oil plays as the best example.  We are locked in as an industrialized nation and can only bring on so much solar, wind, wave renewable energy.
2715 2018-12-06 19:41:55 Because they almost fucked up my car when I got an oil change from them
2716 2018-12-06 19:41:51 I did my makeup and I turned out looking like a ghost *slathers my face in coconut oil* time to start over again

2718 2018-12-06 19:41:45 Looks like she's headed for the wesson oil
2719 2018-12-06 19:41:25 Is the leading cause of global warming not industrialisation by oil companies? I know animal agriculture is one of the largest causes, but the leading cause?
2720 2018-12-06 19:41:18 It's called oil sands, tarsand is a South America things
2721 2018-12-06 19:41:12 It is like a 3 hour flight from Moscow. He can make it. Plus the Russians also need the money from oil. Have you ever been to Moscow ? The local economy is a disaster.

2723 2018-12-06 19:41:03 Listen, if your naturopath can prescribe you peppermint oil for your herpes and call herself a doctor, than I sure as shit am qualified to be your twitter life coach.
2724 2018-12-06 19:41:03 It’s black! I wish it was the mint green. I heard it also came in brown, but I’ve only seen one, and it was pretty dirty, so I’m wondering if the brown wasn’t actually a mint after years of smoke and oil buildup.

But! It has all of the discs, still! Just not the twin needle.
2725 2018-12-06 19:40:49 If you take a look at today when #potstocks started going up , it was when oil started going up.
2726 2018-12-06 19:40:49 Valvoline will do it for you in a half hour WHILE you sit in the car. LUNCH BREAK OIL CHANGE GO
2727 2018-12-06 19:40:49 No surprise here - Canadians pay lots more for a lot of things.  It’s ridiculous- meanwhile we sell off our oil (one of the main economic drivers) at discount prices to the US.
2728 2018-12-06 19:40:42 Who said Lybia & Syria were involved in 9/11?
Ownership of Iraq's oil reserves were given to the People of Iraq.
Before that, Iraq invaded one an ally & trading partner which produces a resource that's a matter of national security for us.
You're fucking stupid as a pile of shit.
2729 2018-12-06 19:40:32 I’m actually not employed in the oil sector but many of my family and friends are. They are not just “rig pigs” but are educated professionals. So open your eyes. It’s not just oil being affected by the economy.
2730 2018-12-06 19:40:31 Many people don’t realize that because of all the traffic, and all the oil dripped onto the roads, that once it rains, & the oil floats on the water, roads can be as slick as iced roads in other parts of the country.
2731 2018-12-06 19:40:23 We achieved the same by stapling olives to the furniture and that. Then we rubbed olive oil on the dog.
2732 2018-12-06 19:40:23 32: roasted with loads of olive oil

2733 2018-12-06 19:40:17 wtf is alive oil
2734 2018-12-06 19:40:16 Frontera Energy plans to drill between 110 and 120 development wells in 2019, of which 95 to 105 will be targeting heavy oil fields and 12 to 16 wells will be targeting light and medium oil fields.
2735 2018-12-06 19:40:11 Carbon dioxide levels are going to keep going up. Texas is producing huge amounts of new oil and natural gas, India and China are building so many coal plants that emissions can't really go down.

The good news is, it doesn't matter! We're all going to be just fine.

2737 2018-12-06 19:40:08 In the case of Hondurans ,Salvadorans ect coming now into U.S, they are not especially driven by a desire to become Americans, just to be Hondurans living under better conditions in America. This is counter to traditional reasons for immigration
2738 2018-12-06 19:40:02 No one talks about the massive oil find (2009?) in Colorado either....why?
2739 2018-12-06 19:40:00 What of the able bodied men That were propagating the cloning of a president.
2740 2018-12-06 19:39:47 The person that put my wife, Cuppy on this list will not make heaven. May groundnut oil pour ontop your brakepad!!! @cuppymusic
2741 2018-12-06 19:39:45 For the ibrik I use, I just put it in a pan on my burners after MANY mishaps of catching it slightly too late and the foam spilling everywhere. Adding a small amount of coconut oil and using a foamer means the grinds all bind at the bottom of the cup, making it very smooth.
2742 2018-12-06 19:39:44 Oil dey ya head nwanne.
2743 2018-12-06 19:39:37 His style failed in his first season when he went trophyless, got trashed 4-1 by Everton, Chelsea home and away before the top managers decided to pump in more oil money. Your man should focus on breaking Mancini's trophy record at City first.
2744 2018-12-06 19:39:34 .@RealSophiaRobot have you listened to Sophie’s oil of every pearl’s uninsides?
2745 2018-12-06 19:39:31 This isn’t about an oil tax, this is the world rejecting globalist leftism. Riots have broken out across the world and nationalists are winning elections globally too. Pull your head out of your echo chamber and pay attention.
2746 2018-12-06 19:39:20 You're right.  It's all very sinister, and Beto is a plant for big oil.
2747 2018-12-06 19:39:14 In my area they won’t even notify parents anymore so I started washing my daughters hair with anti-lice shampoo and spraying it down with tea tree oil and her clothes before I drop her off.
2748 2018-12-06 19:39:11 Roasted in goose fat (or olive oil, if vegetarian) w/chili pepper, dried lime and cumin.  Lime zest and Lime juice squeezed on at the end, they are killer.
2749 2018-12-06 19:38:56 Yep, eggs oil water and 20 sum minutes for a batch of heaven
2750 2018-12-06 19:38:43 Na so him take become oil services company
2751 2018-12-06 19:38:40 I really need to go get an oil change but I don’t want to. Anyone wanna come to my house and do it for me while I watch Netflix?
2752 2018-12-06 19:38:37 Least surprising story ever. Now go find the oil company doing the same for the Paris riots.
2753 2018-12-06 19:38:34 We're a net exporter as of this month. High oil prices help the balance of trade for us now...
2754 2018-12-06 19:38:25 Going to get an oil change then live. What should we play today?
2755 2018-12-06 19:38:25 The RSPO is a feeble attempt at greenwashing & is industry self regulation of the palm oil industry. It has no legal power over palm oil producers except to sanction them as ‘non sustainable’ - what’s actually sustainable about an industry on land that has all been cleared in 50y
2756 2018-12-06 19:38:23 Lol she'll see it, cos there are vampires on the street
2757 2018-12-06 19:38:06 I’m sure there will be £5 sausage rolls and artisan rapeseed oil still available somewhere, But TBH it’s at its most “pleasant” between 6 and 7
2758 2018-12-06 19:38:02 Getting my oil change then gotta hit the mall 
2759 2018-12-06 19:37:56 Mix turmeric with olive oil, should help eliminate sting, that’s my guess.
2760 2018-12-06 19:37:51 @joh @jtattshotmailc1 Take sprouts off stems - shred stems and stir fry with fresh @DrummondHGarlic and sesame oil - delicious side dish & no waste !
2761 2018-12-06 19:37:50 Oil won't stay in narrow price range for too long. It will move.. algos.
2762 2018-12-06 19:37:36 Gosh, how do Norway manage that with roughly the same amount of oil? Must just be better stuff, either that or it’s a different tax regime that hides the true take from oil?
2763 2018-12-06 19:37:24 People in the WORLD are perfectly aware of non top blockage,attacks from the US against Venezuela. GREAT that Russia is helping to overcome suffering of the people because of the terrible situation. Everyone knows it is because Venezuela has the LARGEST OIL RESERVE in the PLANET.
2764 2018-12-06 19:37:22 An oil humidifier
2765 2018-12-06 19:37:22 Don’t hate on palm oil. It’s pretty magical stuff. 

Many sources of palm oil are sustainable. 

Before you boycott a brand for using it, perhaps ask the spokesperson or technical team if the palm oil in the recipes are RFA or UTZ certified for farming & forestry sustainability.
2766 2018-12-06 19:37:19 I saw it somewhere. I’m trying to find the source but what happened basically is that an executive memo went out encouraging oil/gas employees to donate money and a lot of them felt their jobs would be compromised if they didn’t fork over.
2767 2018-12-06 19:37:17 اذا بحتل. And if he occupies the #KSA free #Oil for all . @POTUS .

2769 2018-12-06 19:37:12 I'd sooner go back to writing with ink and parchment by the light of whale oil before I'd use Google Plus

Neoliberalism had its chance. It's time to move ahead, I think.

2772 2018-12-06 19:37:06 My point, why settle for better optics? We know DJT is trash but he’s no anomaly. If anything DJT has pointed out hypocrisy in both parties. Why go back to estblmt Dems? BO had a great optics, he still droned countless civilians and expanded oil production. B/B = same ‘ol shit.

2779 2018-12-06 19:36:18 But I also know that we have to heat our homes and have viable transportation that will not do what oil and gas is doing to our environment. How do we replace more than 250,000,000 cars that are on the road now? What do you suggest? I am very interested in knowing...

2795 2018-12-06 19:34:25 It doesn't matter anyway. Oil is dying.

EVs have already reduced daily petroleum demand by 250,000 barrels.
Every new battery cell reduces demand by 35 ml. Tesla makes 50 per second. 2000 per second in 5 yrs.

Petroleum is a dying industry. 

Keep it in the ground.

2815 2018-12-06 19:32:22 You've heard of peak oil, right? We're also long past peak coal production. There's far greater loss of efficiency in using gas in cars than in energy plants. And again, you're assuming that all power plants are using nothing but coal. That's not the case.

2822 2018-12-06 19:32:03 Beto did not accept “special interest” $ from oil companies. That’s the point which was obscured. Individuals who have jobs in that industry were incorrectly conflated with the industry itself.

2825 2018-12-06 19:31:55 This is misleading, that money is from small amounts from people that work in the oil industry, which in Texas that’s a lot of people , most of the donations were no larger than $250 .
2826 2018-12-06 19:31:39 Doubtful; reporting data is for donations of $200 or more, and the individual cap is $2,700. Beto’s individual donation haul from oil and gas employees was $429,752. The math doesn’t add up it to it being mostly executives; probably more lower to middle managers.

2833 2018-12-06 19:31:12 I’m drinking a oat milk latte and just tried CBD oil via my friend who is a cannabis PR girl while working The Wing. I have reached ultimate bougie levels. 
2834 2018-12-06 19:31:10 Will become interesting to see future capex levels as they had only just started to recover from the 2014 lows and still very low vs past levels. Those calling for oil over $100 eventually have a case in my view due to an eventual lack and lag of projects coming onboard.
2835 2018-12-06 19:31:06 I'm happy with what the true heroes of the world have been doing for centuries. Those who went from oil lamps to bulbs and then from bulbs to neon lights and now LED. You underestimate the power of people and overestimate that of politicians (who suck badly no matter the party)

2847 2018-12-06 19:30:08 Well, I could expound on the benefits, but that usually amounts to preserving a way of life dependent on natural resources like oil and other commodities, and maintaining a political agenda to do it by flexing our muscles in foreign countries.
2848 2018-12-06 19:29:59 salicylic acid one is my fave and for weekly you can use either BHA or AHA). For makeup removal, try using a balm cleanser like Banila clean it zero. I use that for very heavy makeup and it take everything including waterproof shit off easily and its oil based so it isnt harsh
2849 2018-12-06 19:29:58 More likely outcome is losing to Cruz then going on to lose to Trump.  Not for Med4All, 2nd biggest oil $ taker. Just stop with this corporate blabbering. We signed up for change-got screwed. Ppl will stay home like  in 2016.

2853 2018-12-06 19:29:33 We import all our oil anyway, all of the companys that currently extract are foreign owned 
Your point is irrelevant
2854 2018-12-06 19:29:32 I have the easiest chocolate chip cookie recipe. 2&1/2 cups almond flour, 1/2 tsp sea salt, 1/2 tsp baking soda. 1/2 cup grape seed oil, 1/2 cup maple syrup, tsp of vanilla and bag of choc chips. Mix dry and then wet and then chips. Spoon out and bake at 350 for 10 minutes.
2855 2018-12-06 19:29:23 Do you know that Nigeria exports crude oil to U. K and imports pms from there? Do you know that Nigeria exports cotton to China and imports textiles from there? We must begin to think MANUFACTURING!
2856 2018-12-06 19:29:20 Like I said he was running for Congress in a state that relies on the oil industry for thousands of jobs. Reality is hard sometimes.

2859 2018-12-06 19:28:59 Rubbish. @PresidencyZA didn’t reduce the petrol price. The Rand strengthened & global Oil Price plummeted. That reduced petrol price. Government implemented its laws & price was adjusted. What @CyrilRamaphosa did do was impose a fuel levy on petrol in Feb 2018 @SouthEasterFund
2860 2018-12-06 19:28:56 i didn't know that sage-grouse were full of oil.
2861 2018-12-06 19:28:51 Exactly my point, to highlight individual contributions is a futile exercise. Texas biggest industry is Oil/Gas! He was running IN Texas. Where do you think those individual contributions will come from?
2862 2018-12-06 19:28:51 the president does not fear any thing since oil is down and the selling off of stocks causing it to go down. Stock market experts all know this is only temporary.We have been in a trade war with China for many years. We are not paying the high tariffs any longer.
2863 2018-12-06 19:28:49 Agreed and I am please to hear it. I know so many people from my hometown on VT who beat their breasts about climate change yet hypocritically drive suburbans and live in 3000 sq ft houses with oil heat. We all need to do what we can

2865 2018-12-06 19:28:38 Sure open up the coal mines, and reduce the price of oil. Keep destroying the world . Leave nothing for our great grandchildren. Only thing that’s important is the rich get richer. Oh yes I’ll make you richer vote for me 2020. We rich guys will get richer.
2866 2018-12-06 19:28:18 The oil spill in the Gulf is still leaking, for years, polluting water and beaches. Much praised human intelligence was not sufficient to halt it! Why more drilling of this kind in the oceans?????? Can people learn, can people develop intelligent action?

2898 2018-12-06 19:24:52 I’ll presume you’re being deliberately obtuse.
Norway’s revenues are 411 times larger than the UK’s. Norway generated £17.684 billion from oil and gas in 2015 but the UK Government only generated £222 million in its last published tax year.
What’s the difference?

Dress with oil and lemon, maybe a sprinkle of balsamic. A feast platter but simple.
2900 2018-12-06 19:24:41 Actually low oil prices are slowing down the global economy. Orange sloth.
2901 2018-12-06 19:24:31 Yup. I don't think there's a social dem around who wouldn't accept him if he actually walked the walk on progressivism.

Championing Israel and taking lukewarm stances on oil and medicare ain't it though.

2903 2018-12-06 19:24:17 Did I ever ‘blame palm oil as the sole reason for deforestation in Borneo’? But it’s the major reason for deforestation. Palm Oil is an ecologically devastating industry throughout the tropics of the world, it is planetary poison. I hope karma catches up with you one day.
2904 2018-12-06 19:24:11 I went to the dealership for an oil change because it was free! And figured I should do this too. #adulting
2905 2018-12-06 19:24:10 Okay I need a man with a good beard so I can line it up for him and get him beard oil and all that cute stuff.
2906 2018-12-06 19:24:09 You'll always be in your pastor's
tongue if you work with an oil company, doing big business or working in financial sector.. If you are working with oil companies or in financial sector, come out for prayer.. Please what about we ?.. I just pray my own. Amen

The economy has to crash!  Let's get it over with and begin anew.

2916 2018-12-06 19:23:14 Disingenuously making it seem like he takes corporate oil and gas money when he doesnt, is not the same as saying it's raining outside when it is. I'm all for Bernie 2020 but these Charlie Kirk level attacks on Beto will ruin Bernie's chances. Works for GOP not for Dems.

2921 2018-12-06 19:22:40 Yeah, that's Bernie's MO all right: Town halls, where he gets to bloviate but never provide solutions. And Beto's "oil and gas industry" donations were small donations from workers -- kinda like BS's $27 only I have more confidence Beto knows how to get stuff done.
2922 2018-12-06 19:22:37 I guess I’ll go sit in Honda & get my oil changed since I cant fall asleep. 
2923 2018-12-06 19:22:35 Olive Oil loves him too!

2927 2018-12-06 19:22:16 you drove a casino out of business by definition people loose money there yet you went bankrupt and took millions from your investors, you are not a politician or a good business man you are little more then a snake oil sales man a liar and a thief. At worst a criminal guilty
2928 2018-12-06 19:22:08 It really doesn't matter when we all know he doesn't care but he sure likes the money that oil generates. Trudeau is so fake at this point why even bother consulting him for he is just going to lie right to their faces anyways and do what he wants. @JustinTrudeau

2938 2018-12-06 19:20:58 that is a lot of employees for a mom and pop business. His Accountant and bookkeeper must burn the midnight oil writing out all those cheques.

2941 2018-12-06 19:20:55 The fracking revolution has made the U.S. a near exporter of oil for the first time in 75 years. Buzz off, OPEC.
2942 2018-12-06 19:20:54 Get the sticky traps, but then use vegetable oil to set them free off those traps. I've saved a couple little guys with this trick (~:
2943 2018-12-06 19:20:53 individual donations from people employed in oil and gas. Considering Texas is the #1 employer of people in that industry it's hardly surprising.

no matter how much money you have...saying something like that is not nice ...and ..if you cant defend yourself. Cowardly.

2951 2018-12-06 19:20:18 Would be useful for those who celebrate US nr.1 position as oil producer to compare the number of their producing wells with those in Saudi Arabia...
2952 2018-12-06 19:19:57 Well said Mr. President
2953 2018-12-06 19:19:55 They should just change the name of the EPA from the environmental protection agency to the oil and coal protection agency. OCPA.
2954 2018-12-06 19:19:53 Ugh, why did I ever sign up for LinkedIn? It’s literally useless in my field. I’ve just been recruited to join an oil drilling team. I MAKE CLOTHES, YOU SONS OF SYPHILITIC PANDAS.
2955 2018-12-06 19:19:36 That's the reason of empty mind of so called African readers instead of building oil refine, they are just happy of getting share through corruption by importing oil overseas.

2957 2018-12-06 19:19:29 What the world needs is alternative energy investments. It's time to leave fossil fuels, and the combustion engine behind! The geopolitics related to oil is causing death and destruction. Stop clinging to the past!
2958 2018-12-06 19:19:28 Gotta get up at 530am to go get an oil change. I'm leaving early tomorrow fuck that noise
2959 2018-12-06 19:19:23 Also, crude oil prices have declined by huge amounts in the last couple of months...
2960 2018-12-06 19:19:14 I'm sure the News Tribune will now come out against new oil pipelines and fossil fuel use in general.... right? I mean, we are in trouble, yes, but there are solutions, right? Cast of the chains of your timid prose.
2961 2018-12-06 19:19:12 @IcelandFoods Yes Iceland. Love love love the way you're still getting the palm oil message across. Nicely.
2962 2018-12-06 19:19:12 but i dont have any olive oil
2963 2018-12-06 19:19:04 I know essential lemon oil or whatever is called should be mixed with coconut oil. Also I've stopped taking tips concerning my face from the internet because it's 1 wrong move...

2973 2018-12-06 19:18:27 To be fair here, I am not saying Bernie is in bed with Pharma industries. But it is disingenuous for him to point individual contributions from oil&gas ind. when Beto was running in TX and ignore Bernie’s defense, Big Tech, Amazon, Pharma/Health cont.
2974 2018-12-06 19:18:24 You know. If oil drops a bit just turn the chokes up a notch or to :)
2975 2018-12-06 19:18:22 It makes me wonder how old the tires are, when the last oil change happened, etc.
2976 2018-12-06 19:18:11 @PetroHome - Very unhappy about your service. On auto delivery and you let me run out of oil.  Called for service, was told its my fault we ran out. Got a service appt between 12 - 3, just called to see what time the tech is coming and now I'm told not until after 4?  Awful!
2977 2018-12-06 19:18:08 Fam this thc oil got me feeling amazing .
2978 2018-12-06 19:18:07 Beto lives in a big oil state so to win office in that state, he was a little mushy on renewable energy etc. He was being strategic, I'm sure.   Bruenig's op-ed was a little ridiculous.  Apparently, you're not allowed to deviate from the script even a little bit.
2979 2018-12-06 19:17:55 They’d like us to believe this is all over an oil tax.  We know the truth.

2982 2018-12-06 19:17:46 If I understood your question I'd answer it. I think legit critiques aren't just acceptable, but vital. But oil/gas chart of employees and call it industry? That's just a lie. I use same logic w defense industry Bernie comes in 2nd. But I wouldn't put that up, bc it would be BS
2983 2018-12-06 19:17:43 @AskTSA what are the rules/policy on CBD oil?  Checked luggage.
2984 2018-12-06 19:17:24 So much. A little bullet, massage oil, lube, toy cleaner, pop rocks, chocolate Santa with a penis, a ass smacky whip thing, and 2 cock rings.
2985 2018-12-06 19:17:20 We get most of our oil from Canada, not OPEC
2986 2018-12-06 19:17:20 Another word for "oh that place has oil too? Looks like they need some freedom"
2987 2018-12-06 19:17:18 Yeah, it was a dishonest attempted smear, as we know Beto didn't take PAC money, & a ton of working class folks in Texas work in oil.

Btw, Beto was one of the top recipients in donations from just about every field, largely because he raised more than any other candidate.
2988 2018-12-06 19:17:16 Yes let’s get juiced and oil ourselves up and go
2989 2018-12-06 19:17:06 Expectations for more interest rate hikes in Canada tumbled on Thursday after Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said the central bank would need to assess the impact of lower oil prices and as a new threat emerged to U.S.-China trade relations...

2992 2018-12-06 19:16:46 Aye scots oil is shite I know Ive heard it for 53 years from Westminster parties who have 
Hidden it 
lied about the amount of it
Voted to keep 92% of it, (a "deal" England would never take for itself !)
Lied about the amount AGAIN (2014).
2993 2018-12-06 19:16:36 But I know Tea Tree Oil should be diluted.
2994 2018-12-06 19:16:33 He should not be the only one walking out of the meeting if the oil crisis is not one of the most important parts of the agenda tomorrow. Except the federal government of Canada is okay losing revenue every day until Canada has enough pipelines across the country for Canadians.
2995 2018-12-06 19:16:31 Big banks going to start buying their own crude tankers again to literally buy and store their own oil.
2996 2018-12-06 19:16:18 Cmon Denny. We need to kill at least *some* children to protect oil interests. I mean colonial interests. I mean American interests. I mean democratic family values! There we go.
2997 2018-12-06 19:16:15 Thank you Hil <3333 and accutane, I tried everything else. Tea tree oil worked best before
2998 2018-12-06 19:16:10 In the mean time we have to use oil.
2999 2018-12-06 19:16:01 One Nigeria. Nigeria has never been one, let's stop deceiving ourselves and put an end to this unholy union let everybody move on. The only thing joining this country together is oil.
3000 2018-12-06 19:15:51 Kumafa na true talk be this
3001 2018-12-06 19:15:49 Ask why it is they passed a law letting foreign countries become intervenors on any oil development project in Canada too.  Lots of elephants in this room to point out.
3002 2018-12-06 19:15:49 Suggestion 2: if no one calls when you've been publicly laid off, you're not worth your paycheck. Reevaluate.
3003 2018-12-06 19:15:48 consequently, if you are looking towards climate data from an oil company.. well, let's just say I have a bridge to sell you.

3008 2018-12-06 19:15:25 That would be great! Thank you Deby. I am not a smoker either, but I had a vape pen that I used CBD oil in the past. I had a medical Marijuana card then, but not now. It is one or the other here. Opioids, PT, or Med. Marijuana and/or CBD oil. CBD is legal here without a card.

3012 2018-12-06 19:15:08 Thank You @MarkRuffalo what do you think, would @BarackObama help end @algore  ?? Now they are free from government and free from Big Corporate Oil Money. Now Stand together. Also other PPL like @Schwarzneggerr
3013 2018-12-06 19:14:57 To be fair, she did block off a few months before the election to begin giving a $#!+ about oil in an attempt to have Albertans like her.
3014 2018-12-06 19:14:48 At $70k CAD for model 3 in  it doesn’t really scream savings (especially considering today’s oil prices). I’m really #disappointed b/c solid company + product but illogical price point.
3015 2018-12-06 19:14:45 Give me a list of your supposed consensus. Try to find a reputable one and then look up where they got their grant funding. I’ll wait. 

And you wanna talk about oil companies funding the anti-AGW scientists? Laughable. 
3016 2018-12-06 19:14:42 Allah Oga?!
3017 2018-12-06 19:14:40 We also separate Obama from his politics all the time he has droned the most in the Middle East and increased American oil production to the most in the world basically killing the environment but we love him anyway
3018 2018-12-06 19:14:39 I just wanted to be a nice person and pre make dinner tonight. INSTEAD I got hot oil splashed all over my face and arms. 
3019 2018-12-06 19:14:10 Yup like handouts to corporate America like   amazon, the film industry, farm subsidies, property tax loopholes for oil and gas companies  in Louisiana, etc.  They know where to pay for it but you won’t like it.

3023 2018-12-06 19:13:37 Remember, @SecretaryZinke initiated the #sagegrouse review to facilitate energy development on #publiclands. Then he put an ex-lobbyist in charge of the process. And now we have plans that are a huge win for oil & gas and a devastating loss for everyone else. #CultureOfCorruption
3024 2018-12-06 19:13:32 They should just learn to code.  Just like they've been condescendingly saying to coal miners and factory workers for the last couple of decades.
3025 2018-12-06 19:13:31 It was an inside joke with a cough drop.. but I’m gonna go on wild speculations.. crack cocaine, lipstick, OxyContin, safety pin, tweezers, marijuana, hash oil or a key to his hotel room.

3027 2018-12-06 19:13:15 Heavy oil is actually priced at a premium these days on the world market and the article clearly shows the price of WCS spiking after the oroduction cut. At least read the article before spouting off Green talking points.
3028 2018-12-06 19:13:11 Just guessing there will be some oil patch layoffs
3029 2018-12-06 19:13:10 I just meant how can you dream of being a Nigerian in the next world
3030 2018-12-06 19:13:06 $ & oil, the end!
3031 2018-12-06 19:12:57 Lmao. Go for it please. Just make sure you discover oil so we can all be rich 
3032 2018-12-06 19:12:49 Just impose a tax on oil firms
3033 2018-12-06 19:12:37 Instead of allowing the poor and middle class bearthe brunt of a gas tax - tax incentives should be made for oil & gas company transitioning assets to sustainable energy. It should *not* have been a FLAT tax which disproportionately hurts the poor. Progressively tax the wealthy!
3034 2018-12-06 19:12:22 @BillNye hey there guy. So got a question. How many products do YOU use (PERSONALLY) that are derived from BIG OIL? (PETROLEUM) And. Do you support Industrial Hemp taking place of BIG OIL? Also, do you think that scientist are GODS?

3036 2018-12-06 19:12:19 I got that damn organic peanut butter what has the oil floating on top weeks ago, and despite all the mixing and churning, the bottom third has become unspreadable peanut glue.
3037 2018-12-06 19:12:16 trying to squeeze back into ur leggings after using carrot oil in the sunny  holy fuck am like a pork link
3038 2018-12-06 19:12:13 Coal isn't that big of a deal nor is oil, what needs to be done with those is carbon capture and cogeneration plants, which is what we already do. It's why our air is clean. It's public knowledge how to make these things, they're just more expensive.
3039 2018-12-06 19:12:00 Really... What about baby oil ?
3040 2018-12-06 19:11:59 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
3041 2018-12-06 19:11:45 .  Try baby oil.  It's the best. 
Thank me later
3042 2018-12-06 19:11:42 Same. This one time I had a cold I took cbd oil then a month later I was cured

3045 2018-12-06 19:11:34 To be honest 20 years ago I wasn’t a firm believer in climate change but that was before study after study was released that makes it undeniable. Not a single scientist not funded by oil industry denies climate change and that it is because of man.

3047 2018-12-06 19:11:27 Impossible target. As reported in "New Scientist."  World Energy Outlook 2018 predicts in the next two decades India will double its energy demands with China becoming the main oil consumer  and main C02 emitter, ensuring emissions will steadily rise.
3048 2018-12-06 19:11:27 If I may talk my book - use it for sentiment if you like - I am intrigued by a lower intraday low at $50.08 in WTI at the bottom of the range.  Down 3% is still abysmal but oil was not supposed to come back from that knockout punch after a big draw.  #ThursdayThought
3049 2018-12-06 19:11:26 The bad truth is that we should have seized the opportunity during the oil crises in the 1970th
3050 2018-12-06 19:11:26 So perhaps it is time to build it, get some oil flowing and start making money with it, there is a demand for oil and if it isn't sourced from Canada it will be sourced from a less regulated country
3051 2018-12-06 19:11:25 Started using black seed oil and my skin has been prospering.
3052 2018-12-06 19:11:12 There is nothing “bad faith” in pointing out legitimate facts, whether meant as a criticism or not. I have nothing against O’Rourke, but I don’t care for Big Oil’s influence, and I like to know where it’s going. There are plenty of Democrats who take corporate money...

3055 2018-12-06 19:10:56 Yep agree that’s the real PM of Canada , Trudeau just the puppet .  Make no mistake their mission is to shutdown the oil sands period. People better wake up #justsayin
3056 2018-12-06 19:10:53 Sure they can, any blue chip stock is easy to name because everyone uses their products- from banks to cars to baby oil
3057 2018-12-06 19:10:50 True, I am a dreamer, and I want to get more involved with the future of this country then you know. Oil may be a backbone, but I’m just saying it doesn’t need to be, you know? My step-dad is a rigger, so I understand the hurt from the industry.
3058 2018-12-06 19:10:48 Green bond ETFs are excellent in generating liquidity that will be used in financing Energy assets( Offshore wind power,oil), shipping,seafood,aquaculture& desalination, tremendous opportunities in the blue economy but has to be early. @TheMacharia @Kenyabankers @alykhansatchu
3059 2018-12-06 19:10:33 3. Saudi will cut supply as they need $70 per barrel to balance their budget.

They needed $100 3 yr ago but made budget cuts, raised taxes on foreign workers.

Oil is now $60, expect it to go up to $ 70 next yr.
3060 2018-12-06 19:10:32 Reducing demand is a fantastic way to reduce oil prices.  It's basic economics.  You do understand economics, don't you, Donald?
3061 2018-12-06 19:10:31 They must pay until you lose as POTUS45! @VP IGWT. RT  @realDonaldTrump: Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted....
3062 2018-12-06 19:10:23 They are miles apart ideologically!  There’s a deep hatred of DT by the Clintons.  That are as compatible as water and oil!  Proud of the Trumps fighting that far radical divisive ideology.
3063 2018-12-06 19:10:20 ?? Que tiene q ver "la Oltra" con todo esto? Por cierto, hablé del Peak Oil en la presentación del libro anteayer.

3065 2018-12-06 19:10:14 @edfenergy @BritishGas with the price of oil down almost $25 from its yearly high is it time to reverse you almost twice annual price rises blaming rising wholesale costs ? Now prices have dropped do us all a favour and retract the rises
3066 2018-12-06 19:10:12 Add Cum and Engine Oil to top it...Mad ass Combo fam....I mean,,since we are all want to be mad here
3067 2018-12-06 19:10:12 I eat a lot of tuna, as sashimi. Have never liked the taste or smell of the canned stuff. Not even the good Italian packed in oil stuff.
3068 2018-12-06 19:10:07 Everything? Shit many of us would settle for anything? Not engaging in regime change, nope. Health care not dependent on for-profit insurance, nope. Any CJ reform, nope. Tangibly moving away from fossil fuels, do you want the clip of Obama taking credit for the oil boom?
3069 2018-12-06 19:10:05 obviously you do not give a flip about the oil industry
3070 2018-12-06 19:10:04 Oil sector reform: I’m ready to sign PIGB, says Buhari

3072 2018-12-06 19:10:00 2. When Nov deadline came, US gave waivers to nations like China, India until March.

The result is excess supply aided by raised production by US shale oil, Opec and Russia.

Now Saudi is feeling cheated by US double cross as they expected to benefit at Iran's expense.
3073 2018-12-06 19:09:55 The secret of happiness is to see all the marvels of the world, and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon. Basically go out there and experience life and broaden your horizons but at the same time don’t forget who you are and where you came from.

3076 2018-12-06 19:09:44 they are all SCAMMERS get your oil change and get out

3079 2018-12-06 19:09:36 Is it sustainably sourced is the question. My research using the Cheyenne Zoo's palm oil rating app says Skippy's brand is "orangutan friendly" :0 So don't worry, you can eat Skippy without guilt!
3080 2018-12-06 19:09:32 Sometimes I remember the place that mistreated me as home. Sometimes I miss painting. Sometimes I miss the texture of the oil and the smell.

3082 2018-12-06 19:09:26 Lol and from the looks of the market, the cost per oil barrel might be going up more 
3083 2018-12-06 19:09:23 1. Oil prices r down due to excessive supply

Trump imposed sanctions on Iran in May saying their exports should be cut to zero as of Nov.

This led oil to shoot up.

Trump told Opec and Russia to raise production to make up for deficit of Iran oil.
3084 2018-12-06 19:09:19 I'm gonna touch you, I don't want to use coconut oil
3085 2018-12-06 19:09:16 @asda Do you really need BOTH rapeseed oil and palm oil in your olive spread?
3086 2018-12-06 19:09:16 look into wild growth hair oil as well.
3087 2018-12-06 19:09:13 Na groundnut oil (ororo)  that one dey use
3088 2018-12-06 19:09:04 That's a bunch of marketing crap. Peanut Butter is essentially 98% peanut and peanut is naturally gluten free. Unless manufacturers deliberately add wheat, rye, or barley oil as stabilizers. Stay away from that brand, I recommend.

3108 2018-12-06 19:07:37 Be aware that the heavier the oil, the lower the ignition temperature. Try grapeseed oil instead for frying those burgers.
3109 2018-12-06 19:07:28 You guys are bashing me for my age. Just because I look young to you does not mean I am dumb or know any more or less than any of you. I learn something everyday and chances are you do too. Solar is def. More clean than oil. Do you know how much CO2 we emit each day?

3117 2018-12-06 19:06:43 Pipelines make a stronger Canada east to west. Open larger markets. The world runs on oil. We need to implement a plan that Builds a stronger Canada. At the same time we should demand on the development of guidelines and technology that reduce environmental impact
3118 2018-12-06 19:06:41 Dimitri...WHAT? Of what tariffs do you speak? The governments (both state & federal) depend on oil now with more taxes per gallon of gas. Why put tariffs on something they are already making tax $ on? That doesn't make sense.

3125 2018-12-06 19:05:51 I understand where you're going with this. I believe that we are making the earth's climate unstable. Too many people are ignoring facts because of bias research by oil and gas lobbyists, then provided to congressional "leaders" to parrot as "facts."
3126 2018-12-06 19:05:37 I'm Texan & a huge Bernie fan, mostly favorable to Beto, but think  a potus run in 2020 is absurd. That said, I don't think it's realistic for a TX candidate to blanketly reject corporate money + oil&gas money. If TX is going blue, a warchest is needed & in TX O&G is inevitable
3127 2018-12-06 19:05:27 Spending the week in Alberta has been so eye opening. The government here has categorically taken every single action possible to destroy western Canada and the oil business in the country. Trudeau should be ashamed of what he has done to the good people of Alberta.

3134 2018-12-06 19:05:00 Why are Tupperware lids always covered in an oil that no one can wash out.
3135 2018-12-06 19:04:54 Did any of those pipelines get Canadian oil to new markets, NO. Harper approved Northern Gateway but then did NOTHING to get it built. Justin has done more to get a new pipeline to the ocean.
3136 2018-12-06 19:04:51 Spin. FFG and mandarins love building more roads (building contracts, oil, car sales), expanding herd (supemarket and big agri business bonanza) and we won't mention our peat and mountainsides left to die (funding green initiatives gives wrong signal to vested interests)

3155 2018-12-06 19:03:32 Ive had that happen when i'm near the bottom of my cartridge. I think it's the concentration, but i might be wrong. I worry about popcorn lung from the oil itself sometimes, too

3164 2018-12-06 19:02:57 The risk-averse mood persisted. The S&P500 is down 2.0%, oil is down 3.5%, and US bond yields and the US dollar are also lower. Yesterday’s news that the US asked Canada to arrest the Huawei CFO on sanctions violations raised doubts about the US-China trade truce.
3165 2018-12-06 19:02:57 Let them tell us how 15-20 litres of oil mysteriously 'leaked' onto the ground without anyone noticing and with no environmental impact whatsoever. This explanation is so lame even a 12 yr old would find it difficult to believe.
3166 2018-12-06 19:02:56 Lack of internal controls, no board oversight, fiduciary responsibilities abandoned, 5 billion dollars worth of oil missing over 5 years.
3167 2018-12-06 19:02:54 Interesante
Yo creo que habría que tener en cuenta que las prisas a la sustitución del petróleo son también políticas
El Peek oil con las nuevas formas de producción esta lejano
No se puede tener una política anti-inmigración o anti-islamista, si se depende de Oriente Medio.
3168 2018-12-06 19:02:52 The media keeps expecting these carpetbaggers and snake oil salesmen to all of a sudden do the right thing. It will never happen. This is who they are.......they aren't artists or entrepreneurs with a vision, they have no talent, but they have ambition, so they became con-men.
3169 2018-12-06 19:02:45 It really hard to understand the depth of ur ignorance. Our own country is organized on drilling oil to break even around $50/barrel. So these depressed prices actually lose money for American companies. People will be laid off. Ur a dope.
3170 2018-12-06 19:02:39 Yeah, kidney beans w/shallots, garlic, and garlic oil. Seasoned w/cumin, paprika, and apple cider vinegar.
3171 2018-12-06 19:02:39 By not cutting that would be actually more powerful for a future move in oil than a cut.   'If you wait by the river long enough, the bodies of your enemies will float by.' #Russia
3172 2018-12-06 19:02:38 milk makeup hydrating oil before my makeup is helping me a ton, year round i take a few drops of rose oil and apply it all over my skin before i go to bed. i have oily/combo skin btw.
3173 2018-12-06 19:02:31 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.
3174 2018-12-06 19:02:24 Do moms use baby oil anymore
3175 2018-12-06 19:02:19 Journalists:
We need to get rid of coal and oil and fire everyone who ever was involved in production of either. 

Also journalists:
Guys, they are letting some people go around here. I’m really scared. If I lost my job I could not afford to seamless avocado toast!
3176 2018-12-06 19:02:13 In fact, Obama's last public speech, he bragged about exporting more oil than any other president. Is that something you would vote for without reframing the discourse? Shame on you for blaming voters when it's the representative's job to get our support
3177 2018-12-06 19:02:12 Man all I wanted was a simple oil change and the guys basically diagnosed my vehicle with a terminal disease
3178 2018-12-06 19:02:07 $XLE at $63 looks ok if OPEC can sort out a modest cut. Back in 2016 it got down to $50 for a few days but bounced to $55 and has mostly been over $60 for a long long time. Trump needs to lay off oil for this to work mid term (2mo swing).  Generally no fan of big oil.
3179 2018-12-06 19:02:06 I'm not a fan of his environmental policies, to be sure, though I am a fan of him as our President.  Big Oil Death Lists rival Big Pharma's and the Clintons'.  I hope he turns this shizzz around.  Can't get ahead with pillow talk until you're in bed with them.  Time will tell.
3180 2018-12-06 19:02:00 Doubt a single one of them could run a 7/11 and make money. Can guarantee zero could change the oil in their car. They write a crappy thesis and attach the phrase “and how climate change will impact “ to it (regardless of subject) and we’re supposed to give a shit what they think
3181 2018-12-06 19:01:50 I only use coconut oil on my skin and I’ll occasionally use shea butter
3182 2018-12-06 19:01:30 I need to get an oil change 
3183 2018-12-06 19:01:27 You can't make everyone happy. The government, should though, work towards creating a strong economy and workforce. They have to work with what we have and what we have is oil and gas. Unless you live in a tree and shit in a bag, you should support it too. #ialbertaoil
3184 2018-12-06 19:01:22 #GreenTip Water is quickly becoming the most depleted natural resource of our time. Not oil or gold, water. In the next five years, the government projects that 36 states will have a water shortage. #NapaValley
3185 2018-12-06 19:01:08 Low interest rates were due to low commodity prices and we were receiving IMF inflows. Things turned upside down in 16 when BOP issue started. Coal was trading at 50$ and oil in 40’s. Zero rate hikes from FED and no trade wars. Get your facts right first mr economic hitman. :)
3186 2018-12-06 19:01:00 Engine oil
3187 2018-12-06 19:00:55 no problem.... economics - no real good answer for me. Like rising oil prices can drive down the market  and so can falling prices.... that's why I build buildings and don't have an Econ degree :)

3191 2018-12-06 19:00:40 You're blaming the democratic voter for not having a green jobs transition plan? Wow. That is really low of you. The reality, Democrats really had no bold, exciting plan to make that transition. Democrats take just as much oil money as republicans.
3192 2018-12-06 19:00:36 Social media companies are monopolies that create barriers to entry with unfair and predatory trade practices...when this happened with oil and railroads Teddy Roosevelt became the "Trust Buster" & this is the reason #Taxpayers fund the #AntiTrust Division of #DOJ
3193 2018-12-06 19:00:24 Daily baby aspirin, 1,200mg fish oil + omega 3, 500mg potassium gluconate, multivitamin for your age demographic/gender.

Taking that daily, with water, will help keep you from getting sick. I've been around people with the Flu/colds recently, and I don't get ill.
3194 2018-12-06 19:00:24 Maybe! Oddly, I really enjoy sharing the process. But at the same time it doesn’t let me develop fully. I imagine it’s even harder for people who create more time consuming work (like oil painting!). But then I wonder... is the quick sketch process what keeps me going? Confusing!
3195 2018-12-06 19:00:23 I honestly think we are past avoiding this...we are starting down the barrel of climate change and I see no way to peacefully nationalize the oil and natural gas industry
3196 2018-12-06 19:00:22 #HondaCivic WAS CONSIDERING BUYING. 1.5 liter engine has problem: gas in oil. Gas does not fully burn. Excess gas goes into oil. Edmunds recommends 1.5L engine. Class action lawsuits against Honda. Before buying: google Honda civic gas in oil.

3201 2018-12-06 19:00:01 Sure, Kathy. Those individual donations from oil and gas industry accountants, engineers, admin assistants, and - gasp - lawyers, etc, etc, etc were totally bribes. You are misinforming voters.

3203 2018-12-06 18:59:43 Oh I get it, but you don’t seem to. When we had the revenue from oil, it should have been used to diversify our economy so we wouldn’t be dependent on oil. You trying to shove “oil supports our country” down my throat proves my point.
3204 2018-12-06 18:59:42 The phrase "Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free" has never been so apt.
3205 2018-12-06 18:59:34 @Tesla how do I change my oil?
3206 2018-12-06 18:59:33 The way I overuse my oil burner when I’m stressed is actually mad
3207 2018-12-06 18:59:31 Cabbage pasta. Garlic, oil, chilli, onion cabbage. Sounds wrong but it’s amazeballs
3208 2018-12-06 18:59:22 Warm shower with euculyptus oil and rosemary leaves.  Soak for like 30 min listening to your favorite music and also yoga helps (with stressing)
3209 2018-12-06 18:59:19 Cold weather certainly doesn't help  I use a wheat bag for my neck & it really helps/heat pad on bulging discs in mid spine  oh the joys of #ChronicPain I feel sad your going through this so young. I want to use #cbdthc oil #medicalcannabis #EndOurPain
3210 2018-12-06 18:59:18 1 trillion oil fund, 1000 billion. And we have far more oil.
3211 2018-12-06 18:59:08 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou hast anointed my head with oil; my cup runneth over (Psalm 23:5)
3212 2018-12-06 18:59:06 The scientific evidence suggests that it is imperative that we pump the oil out of the ground & put it in the atmosphere & space
3213 2018-12-06 18:58:57 Amazing ideas of Modiji.

- Oil for Rice
- Oil for Water
- Trade in local currency

What else in future?

Why did so called UPA economists not think of this in last 70 years?
3214 2018-12-06 18:58:47 @EFPClean Heya! Do any of your products contain palm oil or derivatives thereof? Thanks so much! XOX
3215 2018-12-06 18:58:40 Better than skinny jeans, top knots, beard oil and vaping. Once I get that flux capacitor working we’ll have a do-over and this time spend all our energies on getting that hoverboard sorted which is something that everyone wants.
3216 2018-12-06 18:58:37 tell me how cbd oil gives me SO much more energy than caffeine ever did? i stan.
3217 2018-12-06 18:58:31 She's plastic, a trophy wife of an oil baron.  Those are the qualifications, dear Ana. Congrations on your engagement - I heard you say you were engaged to be married, yesterday, on CNN  I LOVE YOUR SPIRIT AND YOUR ENERGY.  Don't ever stop being YOU!!!!1
3218 2018-12-06 18:58:30 love the baby facial too except i feel like the ordinary’s aha/bha peel is the exact same thing, way more affordable tho. i hear the de marula oil is better than the ordinary’s tho
3219 2018-12-06 18:58:28 Leave the coal in the hole and the oil in the soil. Let go of the gas & oil money and transition to sustainable energy development for the sake of our children’s future. #ClimateChange
3220 2018-12-06 18:58:27 Maybe we should ban that generation from using smart phones. Average smart phone takes 28 different minerals for manufacture including oil for the plastic.
3221 2018-12-06 18:58:16 Alberta has always been anti tax of any kind and now with oil glut as homes use electricity etc choosing low tax leabes AL in a bad spot especially after spending hertitage fund instead of maintaining it
3222 2018-12-06 18:58:08 Garlic, chilli, pepper & oil. Mamma Mia!
3223 2018-12-06 18:58:03 Can I point out nuclear bombs have at least 1 useful application; putting out gas leaks. The Soviets tried 5 times and it worked on 4 occasions. There were calls for Obama to use the technique to seal the Mexican Gulf oil spill.
3224 2018-12-06 18:58:02 when you are having a day where you're so high strung you can hardly function and you've convinced yourself that CBD oil will at least take the edge off so you can get through the day and yoU LeFT YOUR VApe AT HOmE
3225 2018-12-06 18:57:58 Hahahaa good ol Warr Acres, I’m stopped getting my oil changed an i see a group of girls runnin out of dollar general in some pajamas hop in a car a dip. 30 seconds later there’s a dude running out with a bat on the phone with the police

3227 2018-12-06 18:57:46 I have tons of $USO naked calls, if you can influence oil market then I share profit 50/50 with you
3228 2018-12-06 18:57:34 Why, to let them continue to rob us of our oil and gas.
Let me ask you a question.
Why are we so poor and Norway so rich?

3230 2018-12-06 18:57:13 On the topic of palm oil: whose lens do we want to look through, Judith asks? It’s really important, has grown to become the no1 oil; it's efficient from a land use point of view. It employs a lot of people but not great form a nutritional POV. #IFSTAL
3231 2018-12-06 18:57:04 Lol! That's the worst part?? Not the missing 5 billions in oil? Lol
3232 2018-12-06 18:57:00 Someone just made +58.98% sell on WCX WTI Crude Oil 20x leverage @ 52.829 → 51.250  ~ BEYOND GODLIKE $WTICO $USD
3233 2018-12-06 18:56:52 If you use butter or grease. Lightly floured and fried in canola or sunflower oil. Tada healthy fried fish.
3234 2018-12-06 18:56:42 The Trump administration plans a major rollback of protections for the sage grouse, potentially opening 9 million acres to oil drilling.
3235 2018-12-06 18:56:41 It’s the Saudi oil fields you should wish for. That can be abstracted for $4 a barrel compared to the North Sea which is typically $30 plus per barrel.
3236 2018-12-06 18:56:39  better hide that baby oil
3237 2018-12-06 18:56:38 Notley is managing a dying province as best she can, with the resources available and trying to fight for our industries while still trying to keep us diverse enough so we won’t be dependent on oil again.
3238 2018-12-06 18:56:36 Report identifies too many unanswered questions here to be valuable, other than fact that the oil industry has a vested interest in using their own cost shared caping system not one provided by a caping specialist independent company!
3239 2018-12-06 18:56:26 Anotado! Mandei o pessoal comprar em peso PBR e titio Putin cortar o oil 
3240 2018-12-06 18:56:17 Beto is a fracking proponent. Obama bragged about making the US the leading oil producer.
Given what our planet is facing, this is a deeply depressing picture to me. We need opposition to the GOP with the courage to fight for the radical change we need, and this ain't it.
3241 2018-12-06 18:56:08 More oil to your beards... 
3242 2018-12-06 18:56:04 Coconut oil
3243 2018-12-06 18:56:00 Going to fall through the floor at parity of batteries around 2025. The only high net worth individuals will be those running low overhead and high volume oil sands operations. Automation and volume is going to displace a lot of industry.
3244 2018-12-06 18:55:54 Oil change, tire rotation, and smog...

3248 2018-12-06 18:55:31 Socialism & Democracy are like oil & water. Labor has a problem in that Socialism is in their DNA.
Hitler & Mussolini, both 'dyed in the wool' Socialists, showed the world what Socialism naturally devolves to. FACISM!
Is that what you want to leave behind for Aussie kids?
3249 2018-12-06 18:55:29 Lol good carbs for energy and muscle repair, fruits, sweet potatoes, brown rice, quinoa... protein for gains, chicken, lean beef, turkey,fish...fats, peanuts,certain cheese,eggs, virgin olive oil on foods.. veges for digestion
3250 2018-12-06 18:55:15 If that’s the case why don’t you cut the subsidies to fossil fuels, like you are doing to renewable energy subsidies. Doesn’t seem very level the way you want it does it? Of course that’s exactly what your oil donors paid for right?
3251 2018-12-06 18:55:00 Made my first ever attempt at beignets for a #Chanukah doughnut competition and felt the need to sample one from each batch to make sure they were cooked properly. I think I've ingested enough oil to last for at least eight days...
3252 2018-12-06 18:54:54 mix sugar and coconut oil and rub it on your lips bb
3253 2018-12-06 18:54:46 Hey tariff man the market is down big again today spooked by low oil prices which you helped drive down. All the states with oil should vote you out. Can't you figure out that healthy energy companies means growth and infrastructure? #donnysmallhands #bonespurboy
3254 2018-12-06 18:54:40 Yep.. Xi is taking playbook from Putin, when he pushed aside all the big oil oligarchs and privatized entire energy complex.. Makes sense.. Let USA do the dirty work without getting hit from home
3255 2018-12-06 18:54:39 The Conservatives should have diversified when we had the money from the oil industry and fed it into other avenues of revenue, but all the money was put back into the oil industry and nothing else.
3256 2018-12-06 18:54:34 Cause he has nice hair..... Actually money from the USA. 1st step in taking over Canada was to defeat Harper next was to destroy Oil and gas.  So far it seems to be working
3257 2018-12-06 18:54:33 Hi Emma. Since 2015, we have sourced 100% of our palm oil for our own-label food products from sustainable RSPO-certified sources. We are on track to ensure that 100% of palm oil for our own brand non-food products is sourced from RSPO certified sources by the end of 2018.

3259 2018-12-06 18:54:24 What oil is great for massaging?
3260 2018-12-06 18:54:22 This is the second time that I've felt nauseous and like puking my guts out.

I think I'll pass on food past 5 pm for now and see the results..

And lessen heavy and oil heavy (and the small amount of red meat) to help and see if that works.

In the meanwhile I stay by the throne

3265 2018-12-06 18:53:53 I’m not sure what your angle is on this volcanos biz. Should mankind continue to kill ourselves by destroying the environment or R U ok with going green & taking our chances with the volcanic. My guess is that oil & coal have got u in their back pocket so you like the 1st option
3266 2018-12-06 18:53:53 @lookfantastic Oh no, my advent Emma Hardie facial oil has leaked in the calendar. Gutted! Do you send replacements? Thanks
3267 2018-12-06 18:53:37 If she’s anti-oil, why has she pushed for the pipeline and wrote a letter to Trudeau asking for the premiere meeting to also include the oil crisis in Alberta?
3268 2018-12-06 18:53:26 My deepest sympathy to George Bush Seniors family. A great Boss as a Receptionist in my late teen years at his  oil company in Midland,Texas, and as my 41st POTUS. Rest In Peace 
3269 2018-12-06 18:53:24 Local industry runs on imported Machinery, Chemicals and Oil.
3270 2018-12-06 18:53:10 Personally I'd rather he run for Senate again, and that we nominate someone with more qualifications than "one-time Senate runner-up", but also think it's absurd to go after him for getting donations from oil-and-gas employees IN TEXAS.
3271 2018-12-06 18:53:06 I am afraid of how many of the 9000 companies in my oil & gas directory will remain after this year is over. A lot of good people are going to be without as can be seen by 27% of Calgary’s downtown core sitting empty.
3272 2018-12-06 18:53:02 Beto does not accept corporate and industry donations.

Oil/gas represents the industry his small donors are employed in.
3273 2018-12-06 18:53:01 Essential oils is concentrated so you have to dilute it with a oil, coconut oil, almond oil, any oil.

3276 2018-12-06 18:52:48 Not a question on caring of application but function value to application. No higher power output per material & cost then nat. gas/oil. Consider flight, freight, shipping. Elec. grid will require power to generate power. Is no perpetual motion/energy machine esp. for scale.
3277 2018-12-06 18:52:48 Any oil company
3278 2018-12-06 18:52:43 There are far more than oil and its going to be replaced with far cleaner renewable sources so oil is not the end all be all
3279 2018-12-06 18:52:42 - use sunscreen on your lips to protect them from the sun.

-remove  any lip makeup before going to bed, leaving it on can cause discoloration.

-lips balms & oils like coconut oil & olive oil to keep your lips moisturised.

- avoid matte lipsticks, dries out lips.
3280 2018-12-06 18:52:15 Right now I am hoping my coolant doesn't need flushed.  One oil people said it does, this one is like "let's see first".  I feel like Company A is trying to buttfuck me so now we're gonna see how this works.

If everything is ok I'm gonna be quite happy and get a rootbeer.

3282 2018-12-06 18:51:32 Peppermint oil is great to keep spiders away. Just spray it on the walls and such and soon your house will be spider free!!
3283 2018-12-06 18:51:29 OPEC is also a cartel.... trying to control oil prices by interference in free markets.
Push pulls work both directions.
3284 2018-12-06 18:51:19 No, but I am also aware that just because people in Texas have to work in the Oil and Gas Industry to pay their bills because it's one of the primary employers does not make them all evil.  It makes them forced to work in an industry that should move to renewables.

3287 2018-12-06 18:51:09 "Give the finger to American Business" Which businesses are you referring to? The large corporations and oil companies? In that case, yes. I'll gladly give them the finger.
3288 2018-12-06 18:51:08 Ahahaha, lead tainted snake oil salesman and performance artist. Convictionless dope.

3291 2018-12-06 18:51:00 Still feel the fix has been in on AKState Gov’t since Palin quit & Parnell promoted Dan Sullivan, started handing out corporate welfare to the already profiting oil companies and they all got busted for gerrymandering but did nothing about it. We don’t deserve them, we’re hostage
3292 2018-12-06 18:50:54 I Need A Oil Change Like Yesterday
3293 2018-12-06 18:50:53 Yes, that's the only spray-on oil I have. Olive
3294 2018-12-06 18:50:51 Now playing I Need Your Oil by E. Dewey Smith, Jr. & The House of Hope Atlanta!
3295 2018-12-06 18:50:51 When I went to that museum and saw the oil STILL coming up and read all the names...so many men gave all. Also, this was less than 80 years ago. So many heroes saved so many others that day. Thank you to all who answer the call.
3296 2018-12-06 18:50:47 One of the biggest issues around oil, is the enormous amounts of work it does for us. The avg used 26 barrels per year, 10 for food, 9 for transportation, 7 for other goods, it powers the economy with energy slaves, fewer slaves=less work completed=debts not repaid, it's nasty
3297 2018-12-06 18:50:40 Would someone please buy me some gisou hair oil? My sad hair and I would forever grateful. 
3298 2018-12-06 18:50:37 I didn’t laugh this much since morning
3299 2018-12-06 18:50:30 The world doesn't give a shit. But the US should. Higher oil prices means jobs for all the shale oil you're pumping out and the US companies that support those employees who pump it. Cheap oil - Jobs lost - Companies close. Brilliant. Keep up the good work.
3300 2018-12-06 18:50:29 Got a little advice from my uncle today:
Him: you know what the squeaky wheel got, right?
Me:..
Him: oil.
Me:
3301 2018-12-06 18:50:26 use oil
3302 2018-12-06 18:50:22 Not that I'm complaining, but how is that much sugar and oil considered healthy???
3303 2018-12-06 18:50:19 YOUR UNCERTAINTY CREATED IN THE MIDDLE EAST BY MOVING THE EMBASSY & APPOINTING JARED( A JEW ) TO BE A PEACE ENVOY HAS SPIKED OIL PRICES BY 40% SINCE OBAMA'S LAST YEAR IN OFFICE.  HE GOT PRICES DOWN; SAVING THE U.S. ECONOMY BILLIONS OF $ OF PROFITS & CREATING NEW JOBS! #Impeach45
3304 2018-12-06 18:50:12 The smell of black castor oil makes me want to throw up but it works lol
3305 2018-12-06 18:50:11 If they turn it into another tire place or a drive thru oil change place I’m gonna scream
3306 2018-12-06 18:50:08 "You're nastier than us" finger pointing by the folks in the cushy pockets of big oil, gas & coal.
3307 2018-12-06 18:50:04 Me: Tea tree oil is really good for helping inflammation and redness.

Jared: So does that mean if I pour this on @chieupacabra when she’s mad then she will calm down? 
3308 2018-12-06 18:49:54 i want them all
also i had an idea for message oil type symbiote as well
3309 2018-12-06 18:49:50 We still need some new pipelines. XL expansion would have been a good one. (We are paying the Koch bros. And others to transport the same oil by rail car) and pipelines all over are well beyond their intended life span. The renewable move won’t happen over night.
3310 2018-12-06 18:49:30 i hate the youtube ads that u cant skip pls stop holding me hostage dalda cooking oil
3311 2018-12-06 18:49:24 I’m tired of getting oil changes & putting gas in my damn car
3312 2018-12-06 18:49:20 Guess oil will never get to tidewater then
3313 2018-12-06 18:49:16 DT has RMO's! sam RT @realDonaldTrump: Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted. The World does not want to see, or...
3314 2018-12-06 18:49:13 I’m pretty sure we’re all smiling
3315 2018-12-06 18:49:07 Spray olive oil!
3316 2018-12-06 18:49:03 水(ウォーター)とは仲が悪いです。
3317 2018-12-06 18:49:02 People want to enjoy the game and ignore politics for 5+ hours?
3318 2018-12-06 18:48:59 Wonder if they will let me buy a tree with olive oil.
3319 2018-12-06 18:48:55 Don't you mean baby oil 
3320 2018-12-06 18:48:54 and what do u mean by he made ur day???
3321 2018-12-06 18:48:54 i usually compensate by using hair oil and texture sprays + a really good conditioner, it's not perfect but works pretty good!
3322 2018-12-06 18:48:54 Just finished a hard day in the oil fields. so tired. #hardwork #exhausted
3323 2018-12-06 18:48:52 If you eat bacon... add bacon (cut in little pieces), hot sesame oil, soy sauce pepper salt and pepper. Cut the Brussels sprouts in half and let them simmer until they are cooked to your liking. This is my fav way to eat them!
3324 2018-12-06 18:48:40 Still a long way to go regarding palm oil, boycotting isn’t enough.  With regards to the meat industry though, seriously makes you think about what you’re eating
3325 2018-12-06 18:48:39 I gotta consistently use that bio oil
3326 2018-12-06 18:48:28 Kupe boys are still on tour abi body oil has finished and ovaries have finished?
3327 2018-12-06 18:48:27 India is one of the big importers of Russian wheat.... And also Russian gas and oil.
3328 2018-12-06 18:48:20 Actually this will happen even with fresh potatoes. It's the water content that causes the problem. Just don't let the oil get too hot and keep the oil level 2 - 3 inches below the pots edge, cook in small batches. Tada
3329 2018-12-06 18:47:57 Instead of buying some artwork to put in my house, I’d really like an oil canvas painting of my dogs and me. They’ll have on bow ties. I’ll wear head to toe rhinestones. Cause I’m a classy Bitch.
3330 2018-12-06 18:47:57 That African growth oil is the BEST
3331 2018-12-06 18:47:53 Imagine how much olive oil that takes. Would last me a year for frying.

3333 2018-12-06 18:47:49 death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies; thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life;
3334 2018-12-06 18:47:40 Pakai baby oil sambil dijilat
3335 2018-12-06 18:47:38 You can list every ingredient in peanut butter to me and tell me how they’re each gonna kill me and is still rather have super processed peanut utter than the gross oil natural shit square up
3336 2018-12-06 18:47:37 NO .for a week dollar you need high oil price .even copper price is down haven't looked at trucking yet if that's down also we are in rescission.cattle market is down
3337 2018-12-06 18:47:36 Hey Alaskans, Texans, No. Dakotans etc... Here's dumph tweeting about oil
How's your state's economy?
 
President Trump took to Twitter: “Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted. The World does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices!”
3338 2018-12-06 18:47:33 Ahhh LWKMD Yasir just made my day
3339 2018-12-06 18:47:27 it's just garlic and oil right...
3340 2018-12-06 18:47:26 Chef McElroy cut up some acne, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a blue stop sign, along with Silly Putty.
3341 2018-12-06 18:47:23 Nah, if you work for an oil company and you can just write $2700 checks to political candidates then you're not on my side, I don't need to see anything else.
3342 2018-12-06 18:47:22 Although GHW Bush apparently was a “decent guy” in his personal life, he was a powerful politician and then top executive of one of the world’s most murderous states. The U.S. has been at war in/with the Middle East for 16+ years. And it’s not about democracy, but OIL!
3343 2018-12-06 18:47:22 After your glorious war for oil and glorious economic crashes cleaned out the government coffers
3344 2018-12-06 18:47:18 if individual employees from oil companies donate their money to a candidate, that counts as being in the pocket of big oil? sanders supporters are stuck on stupid.
3345 2018-12-06 18:47:17 They add bit of fish oil
3346 2018-12-06 18:47:17 Should block as AL has been ranting as if oil glut is PMs fault suck it up AL it has to be for all not just AL rich who are getting a taste of normal right now Kenney will only give you ford pcs for rich only once voted it
3347 2018-12-06 18:47:08 the second point here, propels a theory, if not all this respect & recognition, will a average American fight outside his country for reasons unknown (Oil, Political/military Coup and fiascos like Afghanistan)... just a food for thought....
3348 2018-12-06 18:47:02 Why is everyone at the dealer getting an oil change today 
3349 2018-12-06 18:47:00 Aswear if you go fit see her now I know say she dey smile like say she win naijabet
3350 2018-12-06 18:46:50 Not enough support given to Albert   The oil industry needs a plan that builds a stronger economy for the country. Pipelines should be built not only to the west but also the east. The world runs on oil for now.    BUILD YOUR COUNTRY
3351 2018-12-06 18:46:42 Olive oil, black pepper, parmesan. Add Tabasco and / or sun-dried tomatoes if you want to mix it up a bit
3352 2018-12-06 18:46:33 The number one commodity in the US is oil. Oil is part of every aspect of the US economy. Either we drill in the US. Or we buy it where they don't have laws protecting the environment. Drilling here creates jobs and avoids war. The birds adapt.

3354 2018-12-06 18:46:28 Approval Rating? Really? The National Debt in excess of $21T & rising (China alone holds $1T), Dow is tanking, oil prices will be rising. USA is fiscally a mess & headed for catastrophe. That is what you should be focused on.
3355 2018-12-06 18:46:23 Alot of people will lose their jobs if the oil prices keep falling.  A fair price, one that most Americans can be satisfied with, is between $60-70 bbl.

3365 2018-12-06 18:46:00 Dirty palm oil
3366 2018-12-06 18:45:49 Why is it tone deaf? If the measures and people put in place were removed and fired when the JLP won. There is international standard and there was a response to oil being stolen which was reversed when the JLP won. Tax payers are paying for it just like they did for the cake.
3367 2018-12-06 18:45:45 Dear @etoro , @yoniassia Please I would like to trade on my second/new account like I do on my first/old account. $200 min is alot for oil/natgas and x10 is as well. Thanks in advance....
3368 2018-12-06 18:45:44 As in it will cause breakage? 

Tbh finding the right products is LONGGG! I find the more natural butters and oils are the best.

Spray some water, add some jojoba oil then seal with Shea butter. 

Sorted!
3369 2018-12-06 18:45:43 I hate the oil field lmao, i gotta get all my work shit from Cavenders, you know how much Carhartt and Ariat jacket are!?
3370 2018-12-06 18:45:40 The simple answer is we don't. Oil is a finite resource. Imagine an apple tree, where you could reach out at arm's length & pick 30 apples without a problem. Most of those apples are gone, now were' ascending ladders & crawling out on branches to get to the apples.
3371 2018-12-06 18:45:37  yasir I go break ur head o
3372 2018-12-06 18:45:14 You're the guy from the bullshit “Beto takes oil money” smear a couple of days ago, right?  Yeah, you can go ahead and sit down.
3373 2018-12-06 18:45:12 I live Kintyre.
If you choose down the oil industry right now how you propose to transfer patients quickly to hospital if there no air ambulance or road transport?

3378 2018-12-06 18:45:00 Yeah, but the donors he's attacking are individuals, not corporations or Super PACs.  He's saying Beto is a tool of the Oil & Gas industry because individuals who work in the industry donated to him.  Individual donations are maxed at $2100 or so, not the stuff of undue influence
3379 2018-12-06 18:45:00 A report says transporting oil by rail comes with higher risks.
3380 2018-12-06 18:44:53 With little rain both runways and roads in LA build up oil, debris.  When it rains they are far more slick than other places that get more rain.
3381 2018-12-06 18:44:50 Once I’m off oil change, clean my car, hit the gym.
3382 2018-12-06 18:44:50 Hence why we need a pipeline to tidal water to sell our oil to the rest of the world.  What don’t you understand about this?

3387 2018-12-06 18:44:10 Dropped the bimmer off at a shop near my office. New tires, oil change, inspection, and hopefully diagnosing a small power steering leak. Should be in A+ shape in a couple hours. Stoked.

3394 2018-12-06 18:43:07 Except every oil rig worker and environmental compliance specialist is an oil and gas employee
3395 2018-12-06 18:43:06 Watch out for those oil spills around your desk as well.
3396 2018-12-06 18:43:01 Also sir the period of 1950-80 saw lot of recession due to 3 wars , foreign exchange crisis , drought or oil related crisis which kept our average GDP average for these years low

3398 2018-12-06 18:42:59 Today's objective was to get Cirro (my Subaru) ready for the trip to Rockford this weekend. The tread on my tires are in good shape. 

Got an oil change and the serpentine belt replaced. In other words, my chase vehicle is ready not only for the move, but for chase season 2019!
3399 2018-12-06 18:42:57 Worse, the climate change plan includes SUBSIDIES to oil and gas... smh...
3400 2018-12-06 18:42:52 Also per polls majority of Albertans want govt out of their way during boom times (high price oil), but want the govt to pull out every stop and achieve the impossible when times are bad (low price oil).These are easily researched and political parties including ucp bank on them
3401 2018-12-06 18:42:51 has anyone tried CBD oil? Did it work?
3402 2018-12-06 18:42:46 Hey avocado oil fan.

3404 2018-12-06 18:42:30 I wouldnt be suprised if he straight up put $16,000 hoping for an oil baron to pop in.
3405 2018-12-06 18:42:22 I distinctly remember after 9/11, Cheney said if there was even a 10% chance of another attack, we had to do EVERYTHING in our power to stop it. In other words, Al Queda didn't have lobbyists dumping money into Republican pockets, like the oil and coal industries do.
3406 2018-12-06 18:42:15 Heureusement que ça sent le sapin en Macronie, on oublierait sinon que c’est bientôt Noël!

3410 2018-12-06 18:41:57 Trump replaced Scott Pruitt, an oil lobbyist with Andrew Wheeler, a coal lobbyist. Trump's claims that we have the cleanest air and water are absurd given how his minions work hard to eliminate and/or emasculate our clean air and water regulations.

3412 2018-12-06 18:41:41 If you can’t see the appeal of slingshotting a c4 loaded cow into an oil refinery, I don’t think we can be friends.
3413 2018-12-06 18:41:36 A nebulizer uses just pure essential oil. No water & no heat! Also, it’s really hard to find a diffuser that doesn’t use plastic. This nebulizer has plastic but it’s just for the light. It doesn’t come in contact with the oils + bc nebulizers don’t use heat, it’s safe
3414 2018-12-06 18:41:33 the fires are allready lit, the oil is allready boiling, the demons all they need now is to wait for when death comes for her
3415 2018-12-06 18:41:13 It’s easier to just buy the oil u need and do it urself!
3416 2018-12-06 18:41:09 Oil companies do the same thing...it's called land reclamation. They've planted more trees then any activist groups ever will.
3417 2018-12-06 18:41:06 I know what it is.  It was a question in trivia that Jason and I got wrong. Hey Jojoba Oil.
3418 2018-12-06 18:41:04 Try a face mask if the oil doesn’t work
3419 2018-12-06 18:40:59 Dear Liberals,
If climate change is real why are oil billionaires paying me to tell you it's not?
3420 2018-12-06 18:40:55 Rachel Notley: "When I get off the plane in Montreal it's very possible that the car that picks me up will be fuelled by Saudi Arabian oil. How long is this gonna go on? How long are we gonna operate this way?" #ableg #polcan #cdnpoli
3421 2018-12-06 18:40:54 Key takeaway - #Russia almost controls the OPEC decisions with OPEC members relations in disarray & US though being largest producer remain mostly captive & distant from key Oil markets.
3422 2018-12-06 18:40:42 Great truck, runs good. Minor rear seal oil leak that can be fixed. Only sealing because we were gifted a vehicle with lower miles
3423 2018-12-06 18:40:41 Analyzing will be considered uncivil if it bears truths people dont want to acknowledge tho, IE the fuss around Beto taking Oil money. What your saying is simply unachievable by humanity.
3424 2018-12-06 18:40:39 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
3425 2018-12-06 18:40:39 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

3429 2018-12-06 18:40:23 I don’t usually post about health stuff, and I’m not health expert, but I wanted to recommend @Onnit MCT oil. I’ve been adding it to my morning green protein smoothie for few weeks now, and it’s been life-changing. I am so much alert, and I don’t know why, but less hungrier.

3472 2018-12-06 18:38:17 The idea of hailing oil exports at WTI ~ $55-60pb price and a net environmental & economic loss is rather insane. Majority of producers are treading close to a loss at these prices.

3495 2018-12-06 18:35:52 I got a free oil change today 
3496 2018-12-06 18:35:22 You are doing right by creating a positive business environment 4 oil companies that were decimated by the Obama administration's policies and over-regulation. Do more before the Dems take over the house
3497 2018-12-06 18:35:22 What exactly does the world need you for that makes you so important and vital? What can we get from you and only you? We can get everything cheaper from Asia and Europe and we can get oil from Canada and the Middle East
3498 2018-12-06 18:35:21 Dear @JustinTrudeau you need to do the right thing: take bold action on climate change. No more bailing out Alberta's oil industry. Invest dramatically in clean energy solutions. I love my children. I want them to have a future.

3514 2018-12-06 18:33:48 Selling a replacement product requires 3x improvement together with 3x lower price; otherwise same old wins out. So traditional people moving techniques will not work.

On average u can extract 44 litres from 100 litres crude oil . It cost an average of 23-26 % to refine and transport. So, for a barrel of oil u can roughly 65 lites petrol. At current price of $51 dollar . The gas cost on france is $1 .

3525 2018-12-06 18:32:44 The oil money came from the fact he raised a ton of money and lives in Texas, so it's going to be a lot of people giving him money from that industry. If it was from PAC contributions I'd be worried, individuals, less so.

Let's have a primary, that is what it's for!!!
3526 2018-12-06 18:32:44 So other countries should not put any trade restrictions, but you can do it!
That is not fair. I hope Opec stop delivering oil to the USA, so you have to stop your world-destroying polution with green house gasses.

3537 2018-12-06 18:31:33 Obviously #Tarriffman  has not recognized this. He's still cheating that he likes lower oil prices. He only sees some details of the economy, not the whole picture.
3538 2018-12-06 18:31:32 Dear @cathmckenna you've got to stop the unending support of oil and gas. Provide a vision to Canadians that demonstrates responsibility, sustainability and resilience. Right now, we have a vision of the past and its not forward looking. #keepitintheground
3539 2018-12-06 18:31:31 If they think Iraq was bad, just imagine how bad it would turn out to be for them when they try the same bs on a country 4x the size, controls the world’s oil price,
3540 2018-12-06 18:31:27 Define "unnecessary". Fuel underpins the cost of almost all products. It's the poorest of the poor who benefit the most from that "unnecessary" oil usage through lower food, travel, and utility costs, among literally countless others.
3541 2018-12-06 18:31:25 Oil exportation has corrupted most countries where it is done in mass scale. Venezuela, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Russia, Mexico, the US…

3568 2018-12-06 18:29:49 It's not everyday you see large cap integrated players like $SU Suncor, $HSE, Husky, $IMO Imperial Oil literally paddy whacked as if they were high beta speculative junk:  all 3 oilsands majors down at least -5%, with Suncor trading at -7%.  Not liking costlier feedstock/cuts.
3569 2018-12-06 18:29:47 they're fantastic roasted with carrots! Julienne and toss with salt, pepper, and oil; bake @ 450 / 10-15m - till fork tender and browned. <3

3571 2018-12-06 18:29:28 Well the shiny parts of the painting is actually polymer clay pieces I sculpted and painted and glossed. But for the oil paints in the background I just use light pinks and whites
3572 2018-12-06 18:29:21 Well, yeah! Why should he get all the oil?

"We still have a strong American economy."
"But on the other side we have a bunch of geopolitical stuff - oil, Brexit, trade."
"I personally think the yield curve doesn't spell that [recession] at all."
3575 2018-12-06 18:29:05 Guys totally avoid trading using CO Intraday in Crude oil using Zerodha, its a trap because Zerodha provides limited SL, another trap is they dont provide BO so you cant set target however BO is provided on Upstox.
3576 2018-12-06 18:28:58 I air-fry them with no oil. You can spray on a bit, to taste
3577 2018-12-06 18:28:55 Oil is the base for synthetic fibres, pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, lubricants, etc. Your home air-condition is powered by fossil fuel. 
Your world is insane. Planes powered by Solar, diesel farm tractors with wind turbines on the roof?  All idiotic.
3578 2018-12-06 18:28:51 Putin wants low oil as much as turkey wants a thanksgiving
3579 2018-12-06 18:28:49 Where is it going to close today ? -200 pts or maybe -700 pts ? 
With no word on the oil cuts it does not bode well. 
One thing is for certain Europe & China are not going to help.
3580 2018-12-06 18:28:41 they say, there was oil spillage but there is no trace of where it spilt...total theft with confusion...

3582 2018-12-06 18:28:32 F'n market is tanking here & abroad & these OPEC bastards are worrying about the price of oil not being high enough!  Where you breath.
3583 2018-12-06 18:28:25 Second, with many technological advances there is a risk (forklifts are risky, oil rigs are risky) but that doesn't mean the technology should not be used, the risks should be understood and technology used carefully accordingly, and corporate Amazon seems to have failed to do so
3584 2018-12-06 18:28:19 Largest recoverable oil reserves in the world. Saudi Arabians reserves are actually far smaller than they pretend, and have been depleted badly. And Venezuela's oil sands and reserves are of a lower quality, plus they lack our advanced technology.

3587 2018-12-06 18:28:09 I do coconut oil and use the hospital brush to comb through then wash it out. I do it like once a week though

3589 2018-12-06 18:27:56 Startling that this is your response to discussion of the facts that Beto was a major recipient of oil industry money while he was supportive of oil industry, at a time when climate crisis is critically dire. We have 10 years to mitigate catastrophe. Millions are going to die.

3592 2018-12-06 18:27:51 Y’all this man randomly asked for my autograph while I’m waiting patiently for an oil change and I’m like “Ugggh”. It was cause my NATURAL HAIR WAS POPPIN! All the uplifting a sista needs! #BlackGirlMagic

3598 2018-12-06 18:27:29 news saying opec won’t have production cut. But my (reliable) sources and hedge funds say 1.2-1.4 mb production cut.   I feel like someone is making a bear trap.  Opec will cut for sure. They need $$ & they need a higher oil price. #OPEC #oilprice
3599 2018-12-06 18:27:29 $SPY $QQQ $USO #OIL $XLE $DGT $DIA  Iran’s #OPEC governor told reporters that the cartel has reached “some  sort of agreement” but he also said that #Iran, Libya, Nigeria and  Venezuela aren’t on board with the final OPEC deal.
3600 2018-12-06 18:27:25 So start protesting China  and OPEC.  Show you are“doing the right thing”instead of #marketingscam protesting the Canadian ethical energy that is produced.  Canadian ethical energy should displace blood conflict oil of OPEC & power China until they can build nuclear plants.
3601 2018-12-06 18:27:24 So the various feathers in the left wing are barking over Sanders v. Beto v. Kamala v. Booker v. Biden et al. Each has something (race, oil, cops, pharma, drug war) that the feathers see as a DQ. Pfft. In 2020, I'd vote for a Palpatine/Vader Dem ticket if it could beat Trump.
3602 2018-12-06 18:27:24 I’m trying to figure out why my oil change is triple the amount 
3603 2018-12-06 18:27:16 "Bailey, the dermatologist from California, has seen rashes on eyelids from essential oil droplets emitted by diffusers, around mouths from peppermint oil-infused mouthwash or lip balm, and dime-sized blisters on toes from using undiluted tea tree oil for toe fungus."
3604 2018-12-06 18:27:07 As a capitalist market, it won’t likely happen here because oil companies will rush into production to keep price reasonable in US
3605 2018-12-06 18:27:07 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
3606 2018-12-06 18:27:01 Putting coconut oil in my hair does wonders wow 
3607 2018-12-06 18:27:00 Big oil
3608 2018-12-06 18:26:54 What if George Bush I publicly said “we are invading Iraq for oil”. 

Or Bush II: “We’re going to send 1M Iraqis to death cuz of oil, not WMD”

If they did, they’d be as honest as Trump justifying inaction w/Saudi Arabia for economic reasons but just did it out loud #TellMeLies
3609 2018-12-06 18:26:49 I gots to get an oil change going at optimal time cause F-that! Wait as little as possible fml

3612 2018-12-06 18:26:40 Precisely. A drop or two of olive oil can help save a soggy slice too.

3614 2018-12-06 18:26:35 Totally. I'm a big believer in personal responsibility. Should we warn those close to us? Absolutely. I also believe our faith is ours and we must tend to it like our life depends on it (it does). So if people are fooled by a snake oil salesmen, they must own it to some degree
3615 2018-12-06 18:26:32 Exactly.m. That is what needs to end, both the constant wars under pretext of “democratic freedom” to take ownership of oil and other foreign natural resources that the US wants to exploit, and the use of those fossil fuels. Progressives oppose oil & want green energy sources.
3616 2018-12-06 18:26:28 Instead of hoping, why not eliminate dependence on foreign oil instead?
3617 2018-12-06 18:26:19 Were those barrels of oil dumped in the sea like the sheets of zinc? Maybe we need to hire a deep sea salvaging company. #Petrofunds

3622 2018-12-06 18:25:27 It is incredible that now that some labour punters have decided to think about climate change SNP are suddenly propping up the Oil Industry.

3625 2018-12-06 18:25:10 @MedicareGov @washingtonpost @nytimes @WSJ @SenSherrodBrown @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer So Mr Trump what u r saying is 4 the USA to leave the murdering Saudi Crown Prince alone 4 the sake of oil prices?

3627 2018-12-06 18:25:07 So you ignored the part about pro war as in bombing children in hospitals and busses and the part about oil while we are ten years out from irreversible climate damage, no it doesn’t need to die because of what I want. It need to die so the human race can survive.

3631 2018-12-06 18:24:41 Lol Sarah Abushaar, you don't say? That it's about time the Arabs and Africans Wise-Up and start Empowering their Nations to First World Status before the Oil runs out...

US is interested in Saudi stability since KSA oil is important for global economy
3639 2018-12-06 18:24:18 Don't complain about lower stock prices as gasoline and oil prices drop. 

Consumers own stocks, too.

Lower gas prices, lower energy stocks.

Stronger dollar, weaker stock market.
3640 2018-12-06 18:24:14 The U.S.-based $OIH oil service sector ETF is at an all-time low.  Halliburton, Schlumberger, Keane, all at new lows today and all are expressing cautious outlook on U.S. growth due to uncertainty on pricing, differentials, pipeline constraint, etc.  We will find out in Jan on Q4
3641 2018-12-06 18:24:05 OK idiots on @FoxBusiness complaining about low oil prices. Low oil prices mean low gas prices which means less cost to PRODUCE PRODUCTS that CONSUMERS Drive to Buy. Also CONSUMERS will TRAVEL MORE, creating more ECONOMIC ACTIVITY.

3644 2018-12-06 18:23:57 Why don't we stick to the programme? Lets get Indy first then worry about the detail afterwards! As it stands we have no power over oil anyway! That is if you're serious about having a future world leader in renewables?
3645 2018-12-06 18:23:49 I think just the TV host, snake oil salesman thing he was doing. It was kind of perfect for him, fake, shallow, meaningless ... and I could just turn him off and forget he existed which was perfect for me! :)

3648 2018-12-06 18:23:32 I would fully support Alberta separation,. as I am no patriot, I would not feel any remorse about this future albatross leaving. Win, win, you get to keep future oil profits, should there be any and we don't have to listen to the bitching and moaning anymore.
3649 2018-12-06 18:23:28 ECCB had oil down. I had to cop it.

3655 2018-12-06 18:22:56 I’ve only waited so long to get my oil changed because the whole experience is always a nightmare. Brb gonna go have 3 men try and tell me I need to spend more money than I actually do, all while calling me “little lady”
3656 2018-12-06 18:22:52 LOL I really don't think POTUS cares... I don't, I wanted a VERY DIFFERENT POTUS. not bound by lobbyist money. Bush was paid by oil, clinton paid by wall street. TRUMP was self made...   
3657 2018-12-06 18:22:51 Must’ve been a stability issue. Where theres oil theres problems. Hopefully they can start now... oil is really the economic game changer.
3658 2018-12-06 18:22:50 The last time oil was $50/barrel gas was $1.89/gal (not long ago) well, oil is STILL $51/barrel but fuel prices DO NOT reflect that
3659 2018-12-06 18:22:49 #trump holds the cards now as he moved America in exporter status with cheap oil . This of course long term stifles exploration and expansion whilst emerging markets become addicted to cheap oil its a win win for trump #Saudi Arabia held to ransom?Russia ? China? #opec

3688 2018-12-06 18:20:32 This CBD oil is the shit. My anxiety gets super bad to the point where I will twitch and stutter my words and it’s happening a lot less now. Also I can actually say what is going on in my head instead of jumbled up nonsense. I feel so good finally.

3691 2018-12-06 18:20:22 During these Advent days of preparation for Christmas, may we ask God to bless us with the "oil of gladness", so that our hearts may be strong and vibrant to rejoice in the wonders of His love made manifest in Christ!

3701 2018-12-06 18:19:27 and while I see occasional cops and firefighters who are female I don't see any digging ditches, laying pavement (actually laying it, not holding the sign), restoring power lines, working the oil fields or on crab boats. This meme may be a strawman but it is an accurate 2/3
3702 2018-12-06 18:19:19 Don’t sell your self short on choosing location either... an oil spill discounted Phoenix West was quite the accommodation
3703 2018-12-06 18:19:18 According to a leaked document, there is not one word of the oil & gas crisis on the agenda at the first ministers meeting. NOT ONE WORD
3704 2018-12-06 18:19:17 This rollback of Sage Brush protections all for oil makes you true evil. You would kill off a species so more oil could be uncovered to be burned and consequently kill off a bunch of other species, possibly including ours. Ever think of that smart guy?
3705 2018-12-06 18:19:16 Tony Robbins and all motivational speakers make millions selling snake oil. It all comes down to "Work hard, believe in yourself and you will succeed!" I don't need to pay $$$ to hear common sense explained a hundred different ways. #SCAM

3712 2018-12-06 18:18:44 I like your face though. First date I’ll show you how to change ya oil 
3713 2018-12-06 18:18:40 The last bowl, on the top shelf, was full of dirty old oil, & landed upside down on my face.

So much for salad. 
3714 2018-12-06 18:18:39 It’s called reality. The Rasmussen poll is always high, you know that. Right now you should be feeling the burn what with stock market turmoil, oil price fluctuations and world leaders such as China, North Korea and well, pretty much everybody ignoring you.
3715 2018-12-06 18:18:30 I wonder who they think they are kidding? We all know that all that #SaudiArabia contributes to the world is their #oil. #OPEC
3716 2018-12-06 18:18:19 CBD oil is awesome. Its similar to the effects of Sativa without the high. I hate being high!

3719 2018-12-06 18:18:00 Yeah fuck definitely. I remember when we had fleas I was vacuuming three times a day and spraying EVERYTHING with raid until the exterminators came. It was right around this time last year! Literal hell. Basically bathed in tea tree oil my skin was so dry 
3720 2018-12-06 18:17:52 I agree you can't shrug off violence against women. I just happen to believe (its proven in my gas and oil town)that more jobs means less crime. Men who hurt women are abject cowards no matter what job they have or don't have.

3725 2018-12-06 18:17:30 By the end of the day today,  #OPECmeet was unable to decide on any cuts ! Tomorrow the Russians re join the meet, if either still no decision to cut production or cuts  LESS than a million barrels, its bearish news for price of oil & good news for India @narendramodi

3727 2018-12-06 18:17:24 Oilies being hammered, need opec to announce deeper cuts than planned buy like usual will not properly act until oil price below 40 dollar's. Hope im wrong.
3728 2018-12-06 18:17:18 Trump will use every means he has to push oil and coal. If he believed in climate change he could not push oil and coal.
3729 2018-12-06 18:17:17 To all the people on Twitter, who think that US$1000 cake is trivial compared to the missing oil, to rest of Jamaica doesn't think so. 

Most Jamaicans have never seen a barrel of oil and know not what a billion looks like. However they know what a cake looks like and should cost

こんなに話ができないやつだったとか悲しみしかない
3735 2018-12-06 18:16:54 It is ironic, It was the Oil price that killed the USSR, and probably will be the same for the US
3736 2018-12-06 18:16:49 Also because it was snake oil.
Sold to a gullible but desperate public with no refunds and total entrapment in a closed political system that outlawed change/choice.
3737 2018-12-06 18:16:46 O/N Wrap:
Equities pummeled - the arrest of #Huawei CFO in China, casting doubt on the future of US-China trade talks; oil plunged by as much as 4.5% after suggested levels of #OPEC+ reductions weren't as large as anticipated; #NZD volatile, but holding above technical levels.
3738 2018-12-06 18:16:38 @halleberrrrry use tea tree oil. It don’t smell to great but it’s got lots of healing qualities lol
3739 2018-12-06 18:16:34 Exactly.  What does he want WAR?  Trump is handling this exactly right - leverage for increased oil production.

Finally, commonsense leader.
3740 2018-12-06 18:16:27 Someone put an orange essential oil on her neck, went outside... whole damn neck was burned. I don't use them but if I did, they would be better and safer to use at night.

2.) It costs a lot of tax$ for aircraft carriers to defend Mideast oil shipping lanes.

3760 2018-12-06 18:14:37 Yes it should be a soy, sugar, canola oil shake.
3761 2018-12-06 18:14:26 Not to split hairs, but over the years, very little of our imported oil came from the Middle East. Most came from Canada, Venezuela and elsewhere in the West.
3762 2018-12-06 18:14:25 I didn’t just buttchug 2 liters of motor oil to not get elected as president of the origami club
3763 2018-12-06 18:14:16 Only one really, his contributions from oil and gas. 
3764 2018-12-06 18:14:06 And the fact that even more _men_ experience violence using the same criteria matters not a whit.
3765 2018-12-06 18:14:05 Two block world is happening soon. India must prepare to come out from WTO. We don't need fast moving commerce. We need high industrialization. We have a huge 120 crore population, abundant rain, water and sea coast. We r huge market. Get oil from Iran n Russia n develop industry
3766 2018-12-06 18:14:05 Really pointless to change your own oil
3767 2018-12-06 18:14:04 Cheap gas prices? $3.19 north of Seattle common price when at $50 barrel, should be $2.19. Yet again, ripped off by BIG OIL and Americans remain apathetic.
3768 2018-12-06 18:13:59 I think Putin wants higher oil - since they supply so much to the world. Don’t think he really cares about the US now
3769 2018-12-06 18:13:51 Fossil fuels do not come from dead organism. We will never run out of oil. Abiotic oil is real. We are lied to so that the price of oil remains so high. Billions of barrel of oil are produces daily, DAILY. Tellin me that amount came from once living organisms ?
3770 2018-12-06 18:13:43 I wish y'all wouldn't expose yourself online for not drinking water- I know ya piss looks like motor oil
3771 2018-12-06 18:13:42 Make the attacks fair. Sirota presented his information as though oil and gas corporations were funding Beto's campaigns. In reality, those were all individual donors whose jobs were even tangentially related to what we think of as the oil and gas industry. It wasn't honest.
3772 2018-12-06 18:13:37 I was just reading that "America turned into a net oil exporter last week ... and the U.S. into the world’s largest petroleum producer, surpassing Russia and Saudi Arabia."
OPEC cuts will be good for US shale, right?
3773 2018-12-06 18:13:33 Frankincense, tea tree, and grapefruit is literally the best combo for oil diffusers change my mind.

3786 2018-12-06 18:12:43 Yes! But that would blow our arms deal with them. Trump can’t let one guy’s death spoil the promises he made to the arms manufacturers, gun makers, and oil companies that funded his campaign. They might not back him in the next election. He feels the CIA & FBI don’t know anything
3787 2018-12-06 18:12:37 Must be really easy to straw man. I say almost daily that oil has another 20 years minimum, 60 maximum. 

Now if you want to sit and talk with the adults, we deal in transparent facts and exist in reality.

Reality: Solar is not clean, oil is dated, there is not a catchall answer

3789 2018-12-06 18:12:32 Baby oil make that sexy body look so beautiful
3790 2018-12-06 18:12:15 Many have lost jobs & others taken pay cuts with less hours worked. Oil companies don’t make &&& when oil is at low prices.
3791 2018-12-06 18:12:14 I've already been flamed by Bernie people for supporting Kamala COP Harris and Beto BIG OIL O'Rourke.
3792 2018-12-06 18:12:14 ...And if you've grown up on fake hatred, it's easy to become inured to it, and easy to latch onto more fake reasons to maintain that bitterness. So, I get the frustration, but it's not based on reality in most cases. I mean, after the oil crash in 2014, Harper did little...
3793 2018-12-06 18:12:08 Gas prices lowest since b4 Bush 43 and the reporting is about oil companies losing $. Which is funny since Lefties want clean air and reduction in fossil fuels so they should be happy oil companies losing $. They r in a pickle. Can't praise prices because means more oil drilled
3794 2018-12-06 18:11:59 Skincare query: seeking tips for dry, winter offices.

3800 2018-12-06 18:11:50 But that's the thing: I'm not saying it's bad if it's coordinated. If anything, that's smart. Just don't be a misleading asshole on something. Be honest. The oil/gas bullshit was clearly wrong. Bernie should want to lead his campaign the right way, as should anyone.
3801 2018-12-06 18:11:48 The Saudis would be happy to cut 800 to a million barrels but the current resident at 1600 pa, ave in DC would not be happy. DJT actions may have helped to lower oil prices but at a cost of now having V Puting in control of world energy pricing
3802 2018-12-06 18:11:39 For the stock market to rise he needs to slather himself in oil and dance naked on the WH lawn.
3803 2018-12-06 18:11:38 yes the issues you address are part of the reason oil is being pushed back.  People seem to forget that the money from oil finances a lot of your causes.  But if you want to kill the goose then continue with your issues.
3804 2018-12-06 18:11:32 I may be feeling ill, but I am heroically roasting up some brussels sprouts and tofu in olive oil, smoked sea salt and paprika

3806 2018-12-06 18:11:28 Her job is to prop up candidates regardless of their principles and priorities as long as their best attribute is making a call and getting sent a check for a million dollars from the oil and gas industry.

She's basically the LeBron of that world.
3807 2018-12-06 18:11:28 What a vast orchestrated conspiracy that those on the left be critical of a centrist who takes money from big oil.
3808 2018-12-06 18:11:27 I gotta go get a oil change and new brakes today.
3809 2018-12-06 18:11:22 All Crawford did was tell Jamaicans that the govt always “losing” oil.
3810 2018-12-06 18:11:19 Have you tried CBD gummies, or oil? Helps me somewhat.
3811 2018-12-06 18:11:11 Without delving into the craft, here’s a few things to try. Put a glass of clean water next to your bed each night and dump it each morning. Sea salt around your bed. Annoint self w/ Santa Muerte oil. Spray holy water around room each night before bed. Good luck.
3812 2018-12-06 18:11:08 Use butter or oil in case of that second tab

3820 2018-12-06 18:10:56 it's definitely not a simple class thing though. take, i dunno, the story of an oil tycoon buying london bridge and having it shipped to arizona. the popular myth is he was conned, thinking he was buying tower bridge instead
3821 2018-12-06 18:10:52 Until Donald Trump and the Oil Companies can figure out how to make billions from Climate Change it'll continue to be denied.
3822 2018-12-06 18:10:51 Appreciate it. I mostly just rant about frauds selling snake oil to unknowing people trying to better their relationship with food. Also I share peer reviewed articles or just interesting food related chemistry.
3823 2018-12-06 18:10:50 - I just spilled an entire bottle of tea tree oil on my bed ... sick is an understatement

3825 2018-12-06 18:10:45 What connection? You think the oil lobby is connected to it? Or is it the coal lobby?
3826 2018-12-06 18:10:36 It’s all about oil. My gas price here is $1.80.

3832 2018-12-06 18:10:05 Sold media: he never used spoken word. He said due to Modi’s interventions in oil prices crisis, this issue got resolved. Bigotry media. Pidi Media is the correct word for you.
3833 2018-12-06 18:10:05 Reports that Saudi Arabia is floating an idea for OPEC to cut production less than the market expected; WTI Crude, energy sector fall. President Trump want cheap oil and a soft USD   $USO

3835 2018-12-06 18:10:02 But the NEP had very little to do with the crash in AB... it was about the global oil glut, which Pierre could have done very little to fix. Meanwhile, he helped ensure that investment in the oil patch continued. Again, I get the symbolism, it's just that it's largely fake...

3837 2018-12-06 18:09:48 How is it petty objection - respond with facts! 

When crude oil is @68 per barrel as compared to @111 at the peak of MMS, where in the retail price was just @76, how is it above 80 now? with almost half the price, because he’s unwilling to pass on the benefit to the consumer
3838 2018-12-06 18:09:43 Awww love her heart.  Needs a heated garage,  warm oil drink and soft blankets. I adore Baby!
3839 2018-12-06 18:09:39 REMINDER: LEON COOPERMAN DIDNT KNOW OIL AFFECTED HIGH YIELD AND ALSO DOESN'T KNOW AMERICA IS A NET PRODUCER OF CRUDE
3840 2018-12-06 18:09:37 That’s the @CBCNews. Myoptic Central Cdns. Ottawa-centric. Altho recently are tripping over themselves to utter these words ‘Alberta’s oil industry is big & is important to Canada.’ Unheard of prior to Calgary flipping @JustinTrudeau the bird when he came to tell us of our crisis
3841 2018-12-06 18:09:36 I just want a barrel of oil for Christmas. There’s 600,000 of them on the loose. One is all I asks for.
3842 2018-12-06 18:09:25 Everytime I come to get an oil change they give me a different pricing, they really be pulling one over on me 
3843 2018-12-06 18:09:21 What a lovely person you are. 
Of course, we now know that you are not @andrealeadsom but an irritating little bot. 
Not exactly an oil painting yourself - my excuse is that I'm 65, what's yours?
Oh, you don't have one. 
3844 2018-12-06 18:09:20 shrimp, clams, or langostino tail, in smoked paprika + saffron with garlic and tomatoes sautee'd in way too much olive oil . Lil lemon on top.
3845 2018-12-06 18:09:20 I scraped around one night when I couldn’t be arsed to go to the shop and made fresh tagliatelle with olive oil, garlic, lemon zest spinach and baby plum tomatoes. It was bloody lovely.
3846 2018-12-06 18:08:53 I wrote Vandoilay because this about oil.
3847 2018-12-06 18:08:52 What an incredible body, and covered in baby oil, no joke you got me soooooo hard
3848 2018-12-06 18:08:42 Oh no. Could this also happen if I have a serum with Tea tree oil, Hylearonic acid and something called ceramid ?
3849 2018-12-06 18:08:36 when a scientist runs into a infinite number he need to do something about it or math breaks down. If you ask an economist how much oil cost he will say "15". You ask, how much oil is there then? Infinite! Or everything breaks down. Don't forget $ is mumbo jumbo numbers.
3850 2018-12-06 18:08:28 Love the idea in the minds of prominent liberals that oil industry workers are mostly staunch environmentalists - re: attempts to “gotcha” @davidsirota
3851 2018-12-06 18:08:24 FTSE 100 finishes down 3.15% on global trade/growth concerns & lower oil price. biggest one day fall since 24 June 2016, day after referendum, when it also fell by 3.15%
3852 2018-12-06 18:08:21 I think "sinister" is pretty damn strong, but I also think Bernie discussed this strategy with these folks. And that's fine to want to hold other candidates accountable. But the oil/gas thing by Sirota? Pretty damn misleading, and if Bernie personally asked for that, not cool.
3853 2018-12-06 18:08:20 If you oppose drilling for oil, turn in your car, stop flying, and enjoy your bicycle.
3854 2018-12-06 18:08:18 Warrior Mommy™ on IG telling me broccoli oil is "good for autism". How? I know what broccoli does to me and there's nothing good about it. 
And did they mean "relieves sensory and emotional distress"? I doubt it.
3855 2018-12-06 18:08:18 This climate talk is too soft. Big oil must be marginalized as Big Tobacco was. This requires calling them out. Their decades’ long obstruction of clean energy continues to be the greatest crime ever committed against humanity.

3870 2018-12-06 18:07:15 OPEC collapse will mean more war in the ME. Oil goes up and in the end big oil takes little oil AGAIN.

3872 2018-12-06 18:07:06 “Back in 1990s, the agriculture was called a ‘black hole’, where one should not invest,..." Sounds eerily like corporate multinationalist advice to the Canadian oil industry in the early 70s regarding refining and transportation infrastructure. Reap what is sown, so to speak.

3875 2018-12-06 18:07:00 @DrTamilisaiBJP Do you think people do not understand the reason behind this price drop? Everyone knows that it is because of the elections and also drop in oil price in the international market... So, stop claiming that Modi who is busy attending actress wedding did this..
3876 2018-12-06 18:06:58 Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted. The World does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices!
3877 2018-12-06 18:06:57 Oil change!
3878 2018-12-06 18:06:57 Oil is most manipulated market in the world, flled with artificial highs/lows. If you subscribe to the general equilibrium theory, you find perfect competition. Whereby price is steady and neither party is made better at the expense of the other. We need strong and stable prices.

3881 2018-12-06 18:06:46 You were the same journalist asking questions abt price hike in fuel even when crude oil was less. Now fuel prices are low. U left that & now you have came to farmer's. Had you asked them y are you selling ₹120kg for dal. When it was high?
No you question only which suits you.
3882 2018-12-06 18:06:46 Banning the use of millions of acres from oil drilling only hurts the working class. America's middle class has been shrinking for decades because of unwise knee jerk regulations that are killing Americans while D.C. and surrounding area are the richest in the nation.
3883 2018-12-06 18:06:32 Bro one time I spilled the entire vat of red lobster hot butter on the floor.  Two and a half hours with no tables while I basically scrubbed OIL off of the floor. It was horrible :’)

3890 2018-12-06 18:06:00 Uh, like no shit - the US didn't put an embargo on China.
This is a huge gaping hole in your reporting - I don't like Maduro, but sanctions on Chavez were spiteful & unwarranted - for whatever problems, he spent the nation's oil money on people. Where'd they be w/o the embargo?

3892 2018-12-06 18:05:46 the governments in Ottawa and Edmonton were heavily involved in tax incentives, pushing the oil sands producers, like CNRL, Cenovus and MEG to increase production of the bitumen blend product

3914 2018-12-06 18:03:27 Because...Beto didn't take oil money, maybe?

He took money from Texans, some of whom work in the oil industry. Have you been here? It's kind of a big deal.

3918 2018-12-06 18:03:10 I’m guessing because refined gas is highly explosive for starters. Oil is not. Alberta supplies more oil to the USA than any other country. Refineries all over the USA handle bitumen. I’m sure Irving can do it too.

3921 2018-12-06 18:03:04 Ah je n’en suis pas encore là. J’ai lu seulement la partie sur l’Amérique.
3922 2018-12-06 18:03:03 But for the time being oil and gas are a necessity, not only for energy, until there is enough clean energy that is. It could take several generations and Nuclear power is no option.
3923 2018-12-06 18:03:02 The writing's on the wall. Oil is dying fast.
Every new battery cell manufactured reduces daily petroleum demand by 35 ml. Tesla currently manufactures 50/second. They'll be up to 2,000/second by 2023.

EVs reduce daily oil demand by 250,000 already. We're just getting started.
3924 2018-12-06 18:02:58 "Irresponsible and ignorant faction of trump administration to ease oil drilling controls protecting imperiled bird" would be a more accurate headline.

3927 2018-12-06 18:02:48 You're going to drill for more oil, killing off the sage grouse in the short term, and human beings in the long term.

3930 2018-12-06 18:02:35 Risotto.  Caramalize onion and garlic in olive oil.  Use a 50/50 mixture of carrot juice and veg broth.  A bit of wine to taste at the end: salt, pepper and some chopped basil at end. B
3931 2018-12-06 18:02:31 1) Lardons or similar, mushrooms, creme fraiche (or sour cream). 
2) Well fried sliced mushrooms and wild garlic. Or pesto, if no wild garlic. I blitz WG with oil when in season and freeze in ice cubes so have some for a bit longer.
3932 2018-12-06 18:02:24 Boy it would sure be nice to not look at my phone in the morning and see that this administration is pulling back protections on our lands and wildlife so oil companies can exploit more of our resources and dump more crap into our air. Now they are after sage grouse.
3933 2018-12-06 18:02:13 Did you even read what the article said about light oil versus bitumen? Bitumen is not flammable like Bakken light!

3936 2018-12-06 18:02:01 You are lying. There are not "as many scientists," not by a long shot. Take away the "scientists" funded by the oil industry, and there are probably 0.

3940 2018-12-06 18:01:41 Coming from an organization that hides pedophiles from persecution, not to mention the fact that sky daddy's annointing oil was Kaneh Bosm oil, literally cannabis oil.
3941 2018-12-06 18:01:40 There is no vs. Me thinks both of them want lower oil.

3943 2018-12-06 18:01:33 Anyway, I wish you guys well out there, I think it is a huge mistake to continue pursuing oil sands production. Economic benefits will never match what they were in this and future economic climates. Not to mention 250 billion in clean up costs that will no doubt get passed on
3944 2018-12-06 18:01:27 They need to start like 20 years ago when the oil companies knew and hid it!

3950 2018-12-06 18:01:13 Signaling to your BFF, murderous Saudi Crown Prince MBS? Looks like the GOP leadership is sick to death of your puppet stance with authoritarian Despots. Saudi sanctions PLUS no arms deal. It’s over. We’ll take higher oil prices to murdered journalists.
3951 2018-12-06 18:01:13 They’re mad because people who work in the oil and gas industry (in Texas!) donated to him.  Let’s get real here. They only like Sanders and people who kiss his ring. No one else will ever be pure enough.
3952 2018-12-06 18:01:08 As we all know, those of us who care to pay attention,  realize that the cycles don't hit instantaneously:  they take years of planning or failure to happen.  40+ years of doing the same thing led to this.  Also, we have little bearing on the global oil prices.

3959 2018-12-06 18:00:37 Did you know that cars manufactured today hold less oil than ever before? This is why it is so important to ensure that the correct oil is used at each oil change and that the oil offers high performance under specific temperature and driving circumstances.
3960 2018-12-06 18:00:30 Yeah, that sucks. Let’s just keep subsidizing big oil.
3961 2018-12-06 18:00:29 Yes, Mineral oil will just sit on the skin and not absorb. A creamy moisturizer would be better.
3962 2018-12-06 18:00:15 No, your chart is for Fuel, not crude oil, we still import around 7 million barrels per day of crude oil.

4022 2018-12-06 17:55:33 Best decision will be to heavily  cooking oil /ghee. That's $ 2 billion worth of imports + unaccounted health cost. Taxing so price goes up 3x-4x to reduce consumption.

4042 2018-12-06 17:54:31 Sure green tech is great. But its ignorant to say oil is dying. Global consumption is increasing. Gluts are from over producing which drove the cost down.

4092 2018-12-06 17:50:14 Time to do a coconut oil hair mask and then cut my hair so I don’t look so crazy

4094 2018-12-06 17:50:10 Oil is dying.
Every new battery cell manufactured reduces daily petroleum demand by 35 ml. Tesla currently manufactures 50/second. They'll be up to 2,000/second by 2023.

EVs have already replaced daily petroleum demand by 250,000 barrels.

We need gigafactories, not pipelines.
4095 2018-12-06 17:50:10 AN ANOTHER THING IT ISN’T ABOUT HOW MUCH OIL IT IS ALL ABOUT YOU HOB NOGGING WITH RUSSIA AND CHINA AND OTHER COUNTRIES FOR YOUR HOTEL MOTELS AND TRUMP DAY IN’S
4096 2018-12-06 17:50:08 somebody bring me oil of oregano.
i don't think im leaving the house today.
4097 2018-12-06 17:50:07 I really like mine.. I’ve had it for about a month now and idk how I did it before lol I use my lavender essential oil when I’m unwinding and go to bed. And right now that I’m sick I’m using eucalyptus and peppermint. I’m a big fan of them
4098 2018-12-06 17:50:03 Market opens risk off as trade war tensions resume
• Top Huawei executive arrested on U.S. request, clouding China trade truce - 
• OPEC waiting for Russia before deciding how much oil to cut -
4099 2018-12-06 17:50:03 Isn't it time to stop calling more oil production/export an economic "milestone", but instead a systemic economic "risk"
4100 2018-12-06 17:50:02 It’s all bullshit! Go after the corporations that make the cars, the oil companies and have them release the patents that allow a real change if you are truly care about climate change. Your just apart of the scam. Fake news enemy of the people.
4101 2018-12-06 17:50:01 the detail on her face is stunning. You really captured her expression. Are you using acrylics or oil?
4102 2018-12-06 17:49:50 People now offended by “Bring Home the Bacon”
Truth is...I’m to busy working so I can bring home the bacon..to pay the oil bill...because...wait for it... Baby It’s Cold Outside
4103 2018-12-06 17:49:49 I get that, but what good is being anti PACs if you still are taking unrestricted donations from rich oil executives! It's facetious and pisses me off. He's taken 40 mill in large donations
4104 2018-12-06 17:49:49 They create Choas then deliver a saviour. Trump/Putin. They need a Repub Prez to disarm America. Military Law- not to go after Swamp but against the people. The Wall to keep people IN. Breaking up Google to censor us- not freedom of speech
Death by vaccine. Oil is running out
4105 2018-12-06 17:49:48 *Iran Oil Min: "We Are Cooking Something", Need to Wait For Tomorrow
*Iran Oil Min Says "We Have No Concern" Over Exemptions #OPEC #OOTT #Iran
4106 2018-12-06 17:49:48 I wonder if liberals will figure out how ridiculous it was for them to believe the mainstream media when they falsely reported that President Trump was a laughing stock to the rest of the world my guess is no the truth and liberals are like oil and water.
4107 2018-12-06 17:49:46 Yes Barb, the interconnectedness 
Of life is lost on Dishonest Disgraceful 
Don the oil mans Con
4108 2018-12-06 17:49:41 Halve them lengthways. Toss 'em in oil, cumin, seasoning & roast them in the oven. Delish 
4109 2018-12-06 17:49:39 Voted NO on Better Together lies 're HMRC jobs, shipbuilding,  military bases, staying in EU, business leaving, the £, oil running out,  pensions,  renewables investment etc etc All lies. We won't be fooled again..... 
4110 2018-12-06 17:49:39 This figure was less than expected and resulted in oil prices falling back.
4111 2018-12-06 17:49:37 Well, I don't know when he joined the CIA, but he was just an oil guy in Dallas on that fateful day in 1963, and 15 years later was the head of the CIA, so I'm sure there's nothing nefarious about that. He was probably just a brilliant guy they were lucky to have found him.
4112 2018-12-06 17:49:33 In addition, oil shares slipped back following an announcement made at the ongoing OPEC meeting in Vienna, where Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih said an output cut of 1 million barrels would be sufficient.
4113 2018-12-06 17:49:16 Stupid. We dont need their oil, US largest oil & natural gas producers. Stop praising the murderous Saudis. Surprised u didnt high five with your buddies putin and MBS, the murderous group. Why close the govt, u swore mexico would pay 4 the wall. closing govt is wasted bil. of $

4116 2018-12-06 17:49:10 オイルだって、泣きたい時もある。
4117 2018-12-06 17:49:10 Oil and gas extraction is a house of cards that’s about to come crashing down. Hopefully before they take all of us with them.
4118 2018-12-06 17:49:08 What does face oil do?
4119 2018-12-06 17:49:06 I am saying invest in a transitioning green economy, One that has a future vs one that is quickly dying. Canadian oil is the bottom of the barrel when it comes to quality, and extracting and processing costs.
4120 2018-12-06 17:49:05 Explain to me how barrels of oil go missing, I think we need to be clear on this
4121 2018-12-06 17:49:03 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. 

Yet they are starving due to their socialism. 

BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America
4122 2018-12-06 17:49:03 There should not have been a need for Notley and Moe to even ask for this. On one hand the Gov  talking heads keep saying' We feel your pain to Alberta" They say the oil industry affects all Canadians. So should be top of discussions.
4123 2018-12-06 17:48:50 Once we rescue her, you owe me a frosty mug of oil!
4124 2018-12-06 17:48:39 Oil is dying.

4125 2018-12-06 17:48:32 Schlumberger reported Q4 revenues to drop 15% in the United States as production pulls back and frac rates drop.  #shale is innovative but the status quo also seems too low to sustain the American oil boom, a major economic driver which led Texas to be #1 driver of US economy.
4126 2018-12-06 17:48:26 "the upward curve of vegetable oil consumption happened to coincide perfectly with the rising tide of heart disease in first half os twentieth century" - @bigfatsurprise - The Big Fat Surprise #ficadica #excellent #book
4127 2018-12-06 17:48:23 I disagree. I am not a fan of the NDP but she is smart enough to know she needs oil money. Notley has an uphill battle in the election next year. If she doesn't fight for Alberta then she is 100 % done. If she is as clever as I think she is, she maybe the first to walk.
4128 2018-12-06 17:48:17 I’m speaking more to the need to wean ourselves off oil now. It’s needed. Yes it’ll hurt but the pivot can turn out well with suppprts.
4129 2018-12-06 17:48:07 This whole thing about fighting global warming is a joke, the paris accord will be irrelevant when we have an alternate to oil. It's garbage like this that kneecaps the economies that fund the projects for better sources, just perpetuates our reliance on it.
4130 2018-12-06 17:48:04 Does lavender oil helps us sleep better? Like for real or it's some placebo effect crap?
4131 2018-12-06 17:48:00 Someone just made +91.15% sell on WCX Brent Crude Oil 20x leverage @ 62.089 → 59.222  ~ SUPREME MASTERY $BCO $USD
4132 2018-12-06 17:47:58 I am in favor of the owners of the oil and mineral rights beneath Trump owned and branded properties asserting those rights to drill, mine and frack on this properties.
4133 2018-12-06 17:47:57 Wall Street Instant Update; At halftime selective buying brings stocks off session lows with the Dow Industrials still down by 450 points at 24,575, the  Nasdaq Comp. off 37, and the S&P -40 at 2660

4134 2018-12-06 17:47:48 Hey @WBrettWilson yesterday the medium sized oil company I work for laid off lots of 10/20/30 year workers due to the lack of pipelines in our epic failing country. Thanks @JustinTrudeau for ending the careers of hardworking tax paying Canadian MenandWomen. #YourBlindJT #WakeupJT
4135 2018-12-06 17:47:43 Glad to see Ben Stevens again. 
Yes he received hundreds of thousands of $ for no work while he wrote laws in favor of oil companies. Yes a witness testified that he bribed Stevens. 
But so what. The policy differences between R's on the take and honest ones is zero.

4136 2018-12-06 17:47:42 They can't find a beach which was stolen 10 years ago, but apparently we expect them to find some oil? Betta unnu just go carnival go wine up and chill and forget all of this ever happened.
4137 2018-12-06 17:47:40 Fuck oil bulls, they’re a drag on the economy

4139 2018-12-06 17:47:02 India to Import Ant Oil Using Rupee Payment Mechanism: Source
4140 2018-12-06 17:46:58 Beto sure is charismatic. But will he reject corporate money from big pharma & big oil? Will he campaign on single payer, Green New Deal, anti-imperialism/militarism, ending the drug war, etc (ya know, all that progressive stuff)?
4141 2018-12-06 17:46:52 I know everyone says CBD oil helps with anxiety, but what if you’re too anxious to buy it because you think it might be an elaborate sting?
4142 2018-12-06 17:46:50 Spent the whole time waiting on my oil change letting my @starbucks cool, and then proceeded to drop the entire venti cup on my way out the door. I'm pissed.
4143 2018-12-06 17:46:49 OPEC members haven't reached an agreement to reduce oil production.
4144 2018-12-06 17:46:38 Brown off piccante chorizo, cut cherry toms in half (1 punnet) and put in ovenproof dish. Pour over chorizo with its oil and add a little more chilli oil, salt and pepper. Roast until toms have softened down and cooked. Take out, add half tub of philly. Top with Parmesan. Voila!
4145 2018-12-06 17:46:37 I am in favor of the owners of the oil and mineral rights beneath Trump owned and branded properties asserting those rights to drill, mine and frack on these properties.
4146 2018-12-06 17:46:29 Her husband is an oil & gas CEO.
4147 2018-12-06 17:46:22 Hell yeah! It's the kickin' new Release the Pee Tape Dehydrated Anise Hot Pockets- yeah, for real- frowned at by Martha Stewart and endangered by Fish Sauce-spun Count Chocula Oil! You gotta love it!
4148 2018-12-06 17:46:18 This is just plain dumb. Oil is a finite resource with higher value when it is converted into other products.
4149 2018-12-06 17:46:18 let me get this oil changed
4150 2018-12-06 17:46:05 You guys are great entertainment while I’m waiting on this oil change. 
4151 2018-12-06 17:46:02 i’m bout to switch cars wit my brother or stepdad and have one of them take my car to get a oil change
4152 2018-12-06 17:46:01 Getting my oil changed and I walk into the waiting area and a man is watching the young and the restless. As soon as I sit down he changes the channel to NCIS. But it’s clear he has been waiting for awhile. I wonder why he’s embarrassed by his love of soap operas.
4153 2018-12-06 17:45:58 Wtf is the oil man when you need him. Ferdous runnin looowwww.
4154 2018-12-06 17:45:57 Sorry Beto, You sure can talk the talk. But walking the walk ... not so much. Most of your fans probably don't know your campaign is indebted to Big Oil, the Military Industrial Complex and the Banks. Think we'll believe you will promote progressive values? You must be kidding.
4155 2018-12-06 17:45:54 A 2 hour oil change 
4156 2018-12-06 17:45:53 This day in 1941 at Pearl Harbor the USS Arizona took on more than a million gallons of oil, today about 6-9 quarts leak from it every day
4157 2018-12-06 17:45:52 I made potato latkes yesterday at the jca and right after I made sure to wash all my clothes to prevent the hot oil smell from taking over my life...but the smell is somehow trapped in my watch
4158 2018-12-06 17:45:45 俺は皆を愛してるけどね
4159 2018-12-06 17:45:40 Yes,  we do. Higher oil prices means  less gas cars and more electric cars.
4160 2018-12-06 17:45:32 Sorry! They have no oil.
4161 2018-12-06 17:45:30 It is clear by the statements that everyone wants them to fix their own mess. They better do some kind of deal otherwise this oil will melt down.
4162 2018-12-06 17:45:25 Keihls ultra moisturizing face lotion is a life saver. A little pricey, but nothing compares. On very bad nights I’ll mix a little coconut oil into it
4163 2018-12-06 17:45:22 And he’s a huge distraction from football. Organizations don’t want that. He made that choice.
4164 2018-12-06 17:45:19 The AG report means many things to different folks. To some, the cake resonates, others the unaccounted $5B oil bill, the corruption, the HR Manager etc. 

After all... this is a watershed moment.
4165 2018-12-06 17:45:10 Ah cruising, a massive ocean and air polluter with Ballast water, gray water, black water, chemical #pollution, noise pollution, solid waste and oil bring some of the #pollutants spewed out by cruise ships, all so the privileged can enjoy and indulge themselves. #oceanplastic

Couldn't buy a 50% approval rating at this point in history.
Even Putin shunned him at the Summit.
4167 2018-12-06 17:44:57 Oh no i hope this wasn't me  i did try to avoid human contact for as long as possible. I hope you feel better soon! I found thyme oil helped if only from the placebo effect
4168 2018-12-06 17:44:45 Azerbaijan is also involved very heavily... look into it. It’s a back door. [Oil]
4169 2018-12-06 17:44:44 Maybe they should cut us off.  Why should they sell oil to the United states,  the nation who hates them all and bombs them?
4170 2018-12-06 17:44:39 Both sides of the science is a colloquial way of saying that Canada relies heavily on oil as a source of income.
4171 2018-12-06 17:44:37 Like all your wars over oil?
4172 2018-12-06 17:44:36 Just took some CBD oil and black seed oil. Living my best healthy life and I have so much energy 
4173 2018-12-06 17:44:31 This was turbo-charged, powered by graft oil .
4174 2018-12-06 17:44:26 On one side he says OIL should be brought to GST and on the other he is complaining about Gabar Singh Tax

Aisa lagta hai Pappu ki Jeb khali ho rahi hai aur wo roo raha hai...
4175 2018-12-06 17:44:13 Heaux oil?
4176 2018-12-06 17:44:07 Seems kind of strange that the former head of the CIA who had business ties in the Middle East and Central America through his oil company had nothing to do with a CIA operation to sell weapons to Iran and send the money to rebels in the Central America.
4177 2018-12-06 17:44:05 engines need maintenance, replacing spark plugs to sometimes rebuilding engine completely. Aging engines leak oil, burn dirtier and dirtier, etc
4178 2018-12-06 17:44:04 Yeah gotta keep oil low so President Cheeto McFatass here doesn’t have to huff his way to Blair House and can take a motorcade instead.
4179 2018-12-06 17:43:51 Now we understand where all the oil on ur face is coming from
4180 2018-12-06 17:43:37 I think so...
4181 2018-12-06 17:43:35 Guys that pay to get their oil changed make my belly ache. Like why tf
4182 2018-12-06 17:43:28 We have a small farm in the heart of oil country Alberta.  
Hell will freeze over before I trust that roomful of politicians with my children’s economic future.
4183 2018-12-06 17:43:27 Lots of good olive oil, medium heat, lots of fine garlic and chilli, small dried tomatoes. Dash of white wine then fettuccine or linguine with loads of parsley. Salt and pepper. Takes as long as it goes to cook dried pasta.
4184 2018-12-06 17:43:26 What happens when u give a shona a country with diamonds. Platinum. Gold. Oil. Copper. Asbestos. Plus a Victoria falls.
4185 2018-12-06 17:43:19 Anyone know less sugar jar with Olbas Oil filters.
4186 2018-12-06 17:43:12 Don’t forget to pack chapstick in your bag! The hospital air is really drying also peppermint oil is great for nausea during labor. Good luck!
4187 2018-12-06 17:43:10 Damn the Nissan dealer takes forever for a oil change 
4188 2018-12-06 17:43:08 All these white men are talking about their CBD oil  fill me in baw 
4189 2018-12-06 17:43:07 OPEC single handedly crippled Alberta before Trudeau was even elected. And they're not even apologetic. They wanted non OPEC oil producers out of the picture so they tanked the whole market - we were just collateral damage.
4190 2018-12-06 17:43:07 Can you ask what kind of paint he's using? Oil painting?
4191 2018-12-06 17:43:00 Well, of course, it would move the International Maritime Boundary, so Berwick, would become a wealthrly Oil Producer.

They wouldn't need to go 'free', they could pay their way, and have lots left for themselves.
4192 2018-12-06 17:42:56 Never used it so I’m not sure. What do you think about rapeseed oil?
4193 2018-12-06 17:42:48 why can Trudeau not show any leadership?
So disheartening. Disaster as PM on the critical national issues. c69 is telling. He's ideologically against oil.....#cnpoli
4194 2018-12-06 17:42:34 Maybe Alberta, Should Separate From Canada, Because of No Help With Our Pipe Lines, Our Oil, Our Firearms Control, Our Loss of Our Rights Because of This Less Than a Leader Justin Trueau!!!Stop BILL C---71 That Bans Handgun and Assault Rifles!!!!! We Are Tired of Your Spending!!
4195 2018-12-06 17:42:31 I use to smoke honey oil. Pretty good. But you and oil is fucking out of this world. #SlipSlideAndAway
4196 2018-12-06 17:42:18 Dear @higgidy I love your food, but now I see you have sustainable #PalmOil in your products I won't be buying your quiches again.

@IcelandFoods do you do quiches? I love the fact you are Palm Oil free 
4197 2018-12-06 17:42:15 Oil is cheap. $HEAR is a bargain.
4198 2018-12-06 17:42:11 Should've reported on CBD oil instead.
4199 2018-12-06 17:42:07 It's not just the oil industry, because ideological 'free' market capitalists cannot accept that any sector can exist for the common good without private profit being extracted.

This is why the NHS has America drooling.
4200 2018-12-06 17:42:03 City oil kamyokya!
4201 2018-12-06 17:41:59 I think we need them to support the petro-dollar.

Not super informed about this issue.

When Iran threatened to base their oil on the Euro, Iran became enemy #1.

We desperately need the petro-dollar to remain.

Someone does. Big oil? Big corps?

Note2self: read more about this.

4207 2018-12-06 17:41:47 hays sana oil
4208 2018-12-06 17:41:43 She's taking time from figuring out how to extract oil money from countries we've invaded to follow her other passion for attacking bruenigs.
4209 2018-12-06 17:41:38 It was all about oil.
4210 2018-12-06 17:41:28 OILの価格が再び50割れそう…
減産はするけど価格は未定って笑
トランプ大統領にビビりすぎでしょ…笑
4211 2018-12-06 17:41:25 You are not serious. This regime us the worst regime Nigeria has ever had even when oil was at 16. We had it better. I think they should just create a country specially for Buhari supporters so that he can continue to rule them
4212 2018-12-06 17:41:19 Think of the distinction by analogy with the orgs in the oil and gas industry. There are production operations and exploration operations. Both involve people with similar skills and use rigs of different kinds. #innochat
4213 2018-12-06 17:41:11 It takes a ton of conditioner, a leave-in conditioner, a hair oil, and 4-6 business hours for my hair not to look like a stringy, tangley, and frizzy mess.
4214 2018-12-06 17:41:07 Man, why you gotta go an' make total strangers all choked up? (Not me, though. Grrr. Football. Oil. Steak. Lee Marvin movies.)
4215 2018-12-06 17:41:04 Why would Iran, under perpetual sanctions, cut oil production? Fuck off.
4216 2018-12-06 17:41:00 He used depleted uranium he destroyed the architecture he was behind road of death bombing retreating defence forces. It's alleged Kuwait was stealing Iraqi oil which Saddam and any seismic tech should reveal is true. Etc
4217 2018-12-06 17:40:54 Aswear. But it's my first time in the kitchen in at least 4 years. Everything was overwhelming to me .

The challenge was too great to let go. I just wanted to prove to my challengers that I still got it, though I failed w/ oil 
4218 2018-12-06 17:40:48 That being said....I came to Jiffy Lube to get my oil changed and the cute girl that serviced my car the first time back in April, remembered me when I came in and I must admit that it made me really happy.
4219 2018-12-06 17:40:47 When I was a kid: oh look at those big metal structures, are those space rocket platforms??
Me now: oh look, another oil rig
4220 2018-12-06 17:40:38 It has the feel of an old master's oil painting to it, such great work, Calm.
4221 2018-12-06 17:40:33 Great visionary leaders would be looking to saving our planet by understanding that alternative energy sources is the way to go.  Supplying guns to the Saudis to have their oil is about pure greed - SAD!
4222 2018-12-06 17:40:32 And made numerous newly independent nations dependant on western technology & imported oil to eat.

Then came 1973 ...

4225 2018-12-06 17:40:21 Saudi's exporting US Oil from Texas refinery .... is NOT American.
4226 2018-12-06 17:40:17 I use it to mix with colours for highlighting and scaling up. My Luna Wolves are based black and built up adding white with each layer but the Cermatic white GW paint seems be in either a state of lumpy bumpy or it has split like an atom with this blue oil sitting on top!

4228 2018-12-06 17:40:04 And to be honest, the Fed is probably right.  Oil has crashed and we are looking at a global slowdown thanks to trade war.  No need to aggressively raise rates.

4233 2018-12-06 17:39:35 Donald Trump has changed the way the Auto industry will look at gas mileage on their cars he brought it from 35 miles a gallon  down to 20 miles per a gallon of gasoline the only people that will profit by that does the oil industry

4235 2018-12-06 17:39:15 most your followers have no idea what your saying... just use words like oil, mad, libtards...
4236 2018-12-06 17:39:11 The USA is the world's largest oil producer. Saudi Arabia is 2nd, Russia 3rd. Sanctions against Saudi Arabia and/or Russia would be a HUGE benefit to the USA, but somehow I don't think either is going to happen.
4237 2018-12-06 17:39:10 But doesn't maintaining the dollar standard,means controlling how oil is traded by countries like the saudis'?
4238 2018-12-06 17:39:08 Here's the thing:
Oil and stocks are crashing and USTs soaring. Makes sense.  But US$ is falling.  Doesn't make sense.  Then you see PMs rising.  Does this suggest US$ going down and oil and stocks will reverse?  I know extremely smart people saying 1/
4239 2018-12-06 17:39:07 Stopped out by the fucking spread then oil shits it’s pant for 250 pips! In the words of @Trader_Dante what a cunt
4240 2018-12-06 17:39:03 We interrupt today's climate worship service to remind you that the entire world functions on an oil economy.....
4241 2018-12-06 17:39:02 You can have all the electric vehicles you want; 98% of all products will still have a relationship to the oil industry. WTF is it that people don’t get? People live in there ideal worlds becuz they are idealists...they are not realists!

4243 2018-12-06 17:38:56 The story of last 2 months: first drop for inflation fear, then oil went down for matters totally unrelated to fundamentals and mkt started seeing the oil drop as a sign of recession, and now focuses on the yield curve. I wonder who are the real robots sometimes.
4244 2018-12-06 17:38:54 Agilidad de negocios, reduccion de costos, son prioridades en este sector de Oil&Gas, donde Cisco esta creciendo en cuanto al centro Avanzado de innovacion. Hay simulaciones en este sector que demuestran su avance- #CiscoLiveLA
4245 2018-12-06 17:38:52 Your only argument against investing in clean energy instead of subsidizing coal/oil companies is the old tried and true “SCARY TAXES” talking point used by conservatives for decades. And it’s not even true.
4246 2018-12-06 17:38:50 Oil is the best example to show how Capitalism creates winners and losers.  At $100+/barrel the winners were producers (eg: Saudis) and the losers the American consumers. Now that model has flipped and producers are suffering while consumers enjoy cheap gas.  #LoveCapitalism
4247 2018-12-06 17:38:48 Celery Essential Oil... rub on stomach, chest, neck and wrists.
4248 2018-12-06 17:38:45 He’d have to make a lot of trips since oil was pooling on the surface in places, not to mention coal outcroppings here and there, plus peat right under the surface, all of which probably caught on fire from natural sources now and then. Couldn’t be missed.

4253 2018-12-06 17:38:22 The retired bubblehead master chief that I live with says every cup of Navy coffee has that oil film on it, even at a shore billet.
4254 2018-12-06 17:38:18 Oh we're just past the CO2 emissions tipping-point and oil is so cheap and plentiful that petrostates are talking about major cuts to production, so lets just open up millions and millions of acres to new drilling no matter what the cost. #priorities
4255 2018-12-06 17:38:12   Irving Oil has stated that there is no guarantee they would use AB cheap crude even if the pipeline had been built so you are totally ignorant about this subject. The Libs supported Energy East, it didn't go forward because the profits weren't there.
4256 2018-12-06 17:38:12 La traction animale est une idée terrible pour l'environnement et l'humain.
4257 2018-12-06 17:38:11 he doesnt need to open more.. he's doing it to spite liberals.. pure and simple. 

to help his $$ friends and to piss liberals off.. 

not because he thinks we need more oil.. oil prices are dropping.. we have a glut for a while... 

its pure vengance, that's all it is.
4258 2018-12-06 17:38:10 To expensive.  A new refinery that can handle dilbit would cost a fortune, not to mention refineries in North America are not running at capacity, Cheaper to ship oil 10,000km from Saudi Arabia than 4000km from Alberta to our east coast refineries.
4259 2018-12-06 17:38:07 UN is dominated by Islamic countries and Arab oil and money. That way you get a resolution for each other. So much Jewish evidence and then still say no.
4260 2018-12-06 17:38:00 The 3rd largest oil reserves are in Alberta ,  yet we produce 1% of the human released carbon gas globally .   According the these climate change (weather) models (which are a guess at best ).  If we stopped productions of oil.  It wouldn't change a dam thing.

4262 2018-12-06 17:37:55 Still, any congressman who wants to raise the SS retirement age should be made to work a summer tarring roofs in Arizona and a winter working oil rigs in North Dakota.

4264 2018-12-06 17:37:47 Just what I wanted for Christmas! New brake pads and rotors!  Yay! 
With the oil change, it comes to $265.  I guess the rest of my Christmas shopping will be scaled back a LOT. — feeling pained

Shipping Saudi oil by diesel tanker to Canada exempt? 

Weird eh
4268 2018-12-06 17:37:32 No don’t throw away your tea tree oil! Dilute it with water! Never apply esssntial oils directly to the skin!!

4271 2018-12-06 17:37:28 And he wonders why his numbers are down.  If he keeps on opening government owned properties and allowing oil companies to cross private land with pipelines his numbers will drop further.  This is OUR country too.
4272 2018-12-06 17:37:06 I couldn't see Dow 25k or BTC 20K either but both happened. It's a completely manipulated market and by the looks of things lately they don't care who knows..... I also will call oil below $20 before a full blown collapse.
4273 2018-12-06 17:37:03 $KLXE    where is the bear who badgered me on this …. seems tweets were deleted ….  anyway   the sell was overdone even with a huge plunge in oil …

4275 2018-12-06 17:36:59 drain it, bake it in the oven for a little bit to dehydrate it more and then chop in lil pieces n cook those puppies up with lots of oil. (sesame seed oil is good for Asian dishes)  make sure the tofu is extra firm and not silken.

4277 2018-12-06 17:36:49 hahaha wtf tea tree oil is worse tho
4278 2018-12-06 17:36:48 If shale produces too much light oil that the world doesn't want, they will stop producing it. If the heavy oil is needed, the price will go up and heavy producers will produce it.  OPEC has to protect their price. USA is just trying to be self-sufficient.

4281 2018-12-06 17:36:31 I wear moisturizer lol I need to find a new one though. I think my face is trying to produce more oil cause my skin is dry. It’s weird though cause my face actually doesn’t feel dry I just keep breaking out lol

4286 2018-12-06 17:35:55 Is there any hope of stopping this? Will ALL of our public lands be leased to oil and gas before this buffoon gets out of office?
4287 2018-12-06 17:35:49 Yeahh I got mine through my mechanic & they were about the same, just with the inspection & an oil change plus the labor, it came out to about 280 something, I just didn’t feel like spending that much, I’m just glad it’s all done.
4288 2018-12-06 17:35:47 Trump wants to open a million acres to oil drilling.  The planet is dying and greed is killing the earth.  #ClimateActionNow
4289 2018-12-06 17:35:39 Hi there, responsible sourcing is important to our customers and to us, which is why sourcing our key raw materials sustainably has been a focus for years. By the end of 2016 over 98% of the palm oil used in our own...1/2
4290 2018-12-06 17:35:38 People forget the consistency water and oil create when it rains

4292 2018-12-06 17:35:27 @drjamesdinic  has lot’s of good info on krill oil. Even though you supposedly don’t need to on carnivore, I still supplement with krill, d3, k2, magnesium, ACV and C because, why not? 
4293 2018-12-06 17:35:26 G20 member, GCC member, member of the upcoming Arab NATO. Islamic leadership “1.5 billion around the globe”. 23% of oil production. Ranked 4th in military spending. 25% of sailing ship cross by it. Leader of Islamic counter terrorism coalition. Simply its not a banana republic.
4294 2018-12-06 17:35:11 Saudis sell oil to oil rich Canada while its own oil cant find buyers. #NationalPostShitheads
4295 2018-12-06 17:35:02 Alberta could ignore the shitty ‘national energy policy’ brought in by jr’s dad and shut the oil off now. Winter is here in Canada. No better time to make an example of the anti-west mentality proffered by the Toronto fucking star

4303 2018-12-06 17:34:11 Never forget Norway’s nationalized energy/oil industry. It has amassed a $1 Trillion trust fund set aside for it’s citizens. That is $200,000 for every Norwegian!!

Imagine if we nationalized US energy production!!  It would be cleaner, safer energy in the public interest.
4304 2018-12-06 17:34:11 Lol it’s so weird how America acts like coconut oil is some new found miracle. Every one in the Caribbean grew up using coconut oil in some way. White people monetize everything. Just as they did with avocados 
4305 2018-12-06 17:34:10 We already have friends in North Dakota being laid off.  We voted for you because we thought you would make US oil stronger.  Instead you have destroyed the market.  I’ve always been a Trump supporter but am disappointed in this move.

4316 2018-12-06 17:33:26 Analogy: Reducing oil sands production will result in lower GHG`s therefore oppose a pipeline - based on science. Yet we know global GHG`s will not be impacted therefore no reason (on that basis) to oppose pipeline.

4322 2018-12-06 17:33:09 I don’t think this industry is legit at all. I think it’s all BS and pumped up from all the hype that the country and put behind it as the next coming of Jesus. TSX is going to get hammered in due time. it’s all marijuana and oil.  The marijuana industry isn’t that big.
4323 2018-12-06 17:33:03 Let me guess we're lowering the royalty rates that oil Co. have to pay us to get the dinosaur juice out, hence #giving our resources away. Does anyone have a clue how many times royalty rates have been lowered?

Why wouldn’t we as a country use our own oil first ? Explain the economic benefits of the current situation. There certainly is no carbon benefit.

4349 2018-12-06 17:30:16 Folks so horrified, so shocked, such a beautiful bird among other species threatened.  Yet most will not inconvenience themselves to reduce personal consumption requiring oil.  The irresponsible consumer is at fault here: demand requires supply.

4352 2018-12-06 17:30:09 Sure, but the fact that oil/gas executives are donating the maximum to his campaign would be a huge concern by the same token. So I don’t see it how thats “disingenuous”, when were seeing those donations 3-4x more than we’re seeing $20 from some guy on a rig.
4353 2018-12-06 17:30:08 Why not compare full costs with this vs subsidies to oil industry or military misuse...? Focus on the heavy expenses. If some people are assisted & fed... that’s ok
4354 2018-12-06 17:30:07 India signed pact with Iran to pay for crude oil it imports from the Persian Gulf nation in rupees
4355 2018-12-06 17:30:05 Agreed.  If #OPEC keeps the market in limbo, they can cut without any large "cuts" because it will dramatically slash production in the United States (and Canada to an extent) which will see major pain from the current oil price by virtue of slashed 2019 capex.
4356 2018-12-06 17:30:04 #BREAKING : 
Saudi oil minister says he's not confident of an OPEC deal tomorrow
That's not good
He says a cut of about 1mbpd is the main scenario under discussion
Wants Russia to cut as much as possible
Main sticking point is getting agreement from all
4357 2018-12-06 17:30:01 How would we cope on our own with the burden of all that oil? 
4358 2018-12-06 17:29:37 when I donate to candidates I’m not speaking for my employer. Neither are oil and gas employees. I fight the oil and gas industry as my profession. Believe me when I tell you that not everybody that works for the oil and gas industry is happy with the oil and gas industry
4359 2018-12-06 17:29:17 I take cbd oil for anxiety, forcing myself to do what may seem impossible is the only thing that keeps me from spiraling out or becoming a shut in. Take a walk, make sure to pay attention to your breathing, drink water and be kind to yourself, you’re worth it!
4360 2018-12-06 17:29:16 Whether you believe in man made climate change or not, these are all just common sense steps that will make the world a better place. Less trash, plastic, and dependence on OPEC oil.
4361 2018-12-06 17:29:10 Waiting at the dealership for an oil change. @WayneBrady just made a rules-accurate D&D reference on his game show without any denigrating tone. What a wonderful world. #dnd

4366 2018-12-06 17:28:32 more about a trade policy that appears to have no policy behind it. canada's arrest of huwaei's cfo only adds fuel that the trade war with china will get worse. plus, opec's toothless keeps supply up but usa is now the top oil exporter and lower oil prices hurts stocks.
4367 2018-12-06 17:28:29 Not a smart move on his part but it's the military and the shipping industry that are the biggest consumer of oil and among the biggest polluters.
4368 2018-12-06 17:28:29 I debunked your links. I am not sure what information I was supposed to take on... Tell me, how bad are oil subsidies  compared to renewables? Which one upsets you more and why??

4370 2018-12-06 17:28:10 Don’t we produce more oil than OPEC? Genuine question.

4374 2018-12-06 17:27:49 Theoretically as soon as Iran blocks the Strait of Hormuz,  the US Navy, along with Saudi Arabia and UAE's, will jump in to resume navigation. A conflict  will breakout, and we'll have a major war in our hands and can have massive  repercussions leading to higher oil prices.
4375 2018-12-06 17:27:45 I think it’s because unlike other markets such as natural / earthly minerals (I.e. gold, oil, diamonds) or even sports entertainment, there’s not a quick turnaround in film investment. Investors want their money back quick and fast, but film doesn’t work that way. It’s gradual.

4390 2018-12-06 17:26:17 I recall while I was a kid, I wanted to fry an egg but there was no cooking oil so I used candle wax instead. I later came to realize it was dumb but at the same time I was impressed by myself at how I thought outside the box and managed to enjoy my omelette lol
4391 2018-12-06 17:26:11 Yes the site shows that oil and gas industry employees donated to Beto. It doesn’t show that oil and gas industry C-suite did, or that they did so disproportionately. Again: individual contributions do not mean the industry endorsed him as Sirota implied.

4400 2018-12-06 17:25:36 Cooperman has the best mind on the street . This is market mechanics . If anything , oil going down and rates down are like a tax cut. The machines r the problem and the uptick rule is simply the problem.
4401 2018-12-06 17:25:30 Ever since I watched that motor oil and pancakes video I haven’t looked at syrup the same Lmaooo 
4402 2018-12-06 17:25:28 Good time to be wanting lower oil prices ?  I think not !
4403 2018-12-06 17:25:28 I do have oil paint,
4404 2018-12-06 17:25:24 where did all the oil money go. The Federal Government made a fortune between 2005 & 2014 and there was barely a cent spent on anything other then oil expansion. 
When the Liberals took power the Country was already facing a necessary deficit. @AndrewScheer where’s the $
4405 2018-12-06 17:25:23 You can’t even read polls. #TaxCutsForTheRich You admitted that before midterms when you said you would give the middle class a tax cut, which you didn’t. Deregulation & letting oil & gas land grab our national parks will destroy the environment. You cut Vet benefits. #TrumpLies
4406 2018-12-06 17:25:22 I appreciate that there's not an exact comparison. But Norway made a decision to accumulate wealth, presumably knowing that the windfall wouldn't last. Alberta chose to spend-as-you-go (and undercharge royalties from what I remember). You have no retail tax, right? Paid by oil.
4407 2018-12-06 17:25:22 Where do you get that from? Even Japan and South Korea buy Iranian oil and got waivers. Stop trying to connect issues with no links.
4408 2018-12-06 17:25:14 that shit is frustrating especially if you don't get the necessary attention
4409 2018-12-06 17:25:11 It's like the drug problem. Are oil users not guilty? If there is demand, someone will supply.  There is no moral high ground when families own multiple cars and not electric ones either.
4410 2018-12-06 17:25:08 What level of procrastination am I at? Well, I got an oil change today
4411 2018-12-06 17:25:04 Food? That looks good? And isn't stacked with cardboard or covered in motor oil? Delicious!
4412 2018-12-06 17:24:58 Unless solar + storage grid capacity is about as cheap as oil and coal, the incentives for oil & coal still exist, and you've spent a lot for a long tailpipe.  Maybe long tailpipes are good, but not Avoid Climate Catastrophe good.
4413 2018-12-06 17:24:57 No man. You'd be fine. It's just i rarely get the chance to put my fresh all the way on. So when an opportunity arises i go all out.

I spend most of my waking hours covered in grime & smelling like machine oil.
A nice suit and some cologne is a very welcomed change.

4416 2018-12-06 17:24:33 What? Your take him with the oil too? 
4417 2018-12-06 17:24:02 Our scientists are driven by greed so don't believe them. But you can trust our oil companies and conservative talking heads, they are only interested in uncovering the truth

4447 2018-12-06 17:21:21 That’s an exaggeration and demeans your integrity. Most people find it unrealistic and a distraction to suggest stopping Scotlands oil production with no alternative industries in production. Focus on Independence and then make a serious case. Please.
4448 2018-12-06 17:21:03 Yes, he's being scrutinized. While I have candidates that I prefer over Beto for 2020, the "scrutiny" he's receiving regarding his campaign donors is disingenuous at best. A receptionist for a small oil company can donate $20 to him and that money falls under "Big Oil".

4451 2018-12-06 17:20:45 America turned into a net oil exporter last week, breaking 75 years of continued dependence on foreign oil and marking a pivotal -- even if likely brief -- moment toward what U.S. President Donald Trump has branded as "energy independence."#opec wake up Trump restricts price ??
4452 2018-12-06 17:20:36 My BF was in desert storm. He has his Army letter that says WMD destroyed. He was actually over there when they destroyed them -explosions & wore gas mask.

4477 2018-12-06 17:17:32 For the first time in 75 years, the United States is a net exporter of oil after exporting a net 211K barrels of crude oil per day last week -EIA

4478 2018-12-06 17:17:29 But I keep reading that Scotland doesn't own North Sea Oil. Confused.
4479 2018-12-06 17:17:28 So much Jewish evidence and then still say no.
UN is dominated by Islamic countries and Arab oil and money. That way you get a resolution for each other.
4480 2018-12-06 17:17:25 Im getting my brakes done at the moment and I’m at the auto shop indulging in the smell because I’m weird and love the smell of oil / tires / what ever else is in here that makes it smell like a auto shop 
4481 2018-12-06 17:17:24 Lower oil prices means more wreckless oil burning...meaning a faster route to our demise...haven't we figured out that burning things is not a good thing...come on people...fire = bad...
4482 2018-12-06 17:17:16 An oil change 
4483 2018-12-06 17:17:07 ok ok tell em Sheetz

4496 2018-12-06 17:16:12 Another massive news : modi personally took oil from well to decrease oil prices.
4497 2018-12-06 17:16:11 Your luck... might get projectile boogers and the ability to turn to oil
4498 2018-12-06 17:16:09 Look...another 3D printer snake oil salesman.
4499 2018-12-06 17:16:03 "OPEC agrees to deal to cut oil output, despite Trump pressure"

NO ONE in the WORLD accepts pressure from @realDonaldTrump except the @GOP.

HE is NOT good for America, he is NOT good for the world.

#TrumpTREASON is REAL
4500 2018-12-06 17:15:59 Soon, under #Trump , the United States will be a country of strip mines, coal plants, oil drilling sites and shale-oil scars. We will have dirty air, dirty water and polluted soil. Decide now on #2020 and vote the #RepublicanParty out!!!!!
4501 2018-12-06 17:15:53 Because those that vote for them don’t care about the government functions either. They want America to go back to the wild west. Guns, cowboy hats, oil and God. And no blacks unless they’re slaves. Families take care of their own and that’s it.
4502 2018-12-06 17:15:51 My dad kooked dinner... too much oil... my gallbladder is going to kill me later
4503 2018-12-06 17:15:36 Either you want clean air, or you want to protect coal and oil. You can't have both.
The oil industry will not go out of business if we expand renewable energy. They will just have a smaller mountain of money to sit upon.
4504 2018-12-06 17:15:32 Same way she compartmentalizes taking oil & arms money via Wall Street, I suppose!
4505 2018-12-06 17:15:26 Yes! I have a super anxious lil dog, I give him cbd oil 
4506 2018-12-06 17:15:26 This is a prayer answered for me, but the battle will get hotter now oil & coal will pull out every thing they can against this, we who know this is the way to leave our grandchildren any hope for a future
4507 2018-12-06 17:15:22 Its crazy to think that it's almost 2019 and:

-Women still dont get equal pay

-Trans-rights are still violated

-abortion is still an issue

-healthcare is not free

-facism is on the rise

- we are still in the middle east dying for oil
4508 2018-12-06 17:15:19 UN is dominated by Islamic countries and Arab oil and money. That way you get a resolution for each other.
4509 2018-12-06 17:15:11 The US is the biggest oil and gas producer in the world. Thinking there are lots of folks who would disagree.
4510 2018-12-06 17:15:08 on top and clogs you pores. 
oil blends > pure oils
4511 2018-12-06 17:15:06 Even after tomorrow when we (hopefully) get some Oil Production Cut,
Market price will be somewhat Uncertain,
It has always been like this from such activities in market, 
It will be quite some maneuvering in market, if not everyone would have been rich. #OPEC #WTi #BRENT #CRUDE
4512 2018-12-06 17:15:00 Your "president" pulled out of the climate change agreements because they were "costing America too much money" and were "ineffective". He also basically said the world is already fucked so we should ravage it even more for oil to pay his Russian and Saudi masters
4513 2018-12-06 17:14:55 Just wanted to add to my previous tweet that there were 100,000 jobs lost in the gas and oil sector and Trudeau seems so dismissive about it. These people are suffering and we should care not just throw out “what’s your problem? We only have 5% unemployment “
4514 2018-12-06 17:14:46 Also the people who apply pure virgin oils on their face, it’s okay sometimes if your face doesn’t mind it like rosehip but don’t be surprised if you break out either. It needs to be a concoction of ingredients for the oil to penetrate but if it’s just 100% then it just sits
4515 2018-12-06 17:14:42 Get a cotton ball put a lil bit of olive oil on it to let it drip in your ear the oil will break up wax n stuff

4518 2018-12-06 17:14:38 Investiga, todo esta ahí, busca que grupo de abogados van a demandar y quien los contrató, todo está en internet. Busca quien compro parte de Sierra oil & gas. También busca si lo vendieron y lo que ''encontró'' en su zona.
4519 2018-12-06 17:14:31 I’m cleaning my gross ass car today, and getting my oil changed and probably running some more errands today. I just wanna sleep tho.

4521 2018-12-06 17:14:24 We are so wasteful in this country imaging a huge N9bn for shoes,boots ...i wish the crude oil dried up ,may be we can be serious
4522 2018-12-06 17:14:21 Seriously fuck CBD oil. It gave me the worst migraines. But marijuana doesn't?!
4523 2018-12-06 17:14:20 Thank you for your feedback, @WelcomeSticker, & for reading! This Farm Bill has been really something to follow. I love adding new sources for my stories & likely will cover it again in the future. If you have anyone in the CBD oil industry you'd like to recommend, please do!
4524 2018-12-06 17:14:17 I think this is first time any Indian Prime Minister is said to be influencing Oil price. Though late, it's a welcome recognition of the consumer power of the country and increasing regional status of our nation. It's the result of tireless efforts of current government.
4525 2018-12-06 17:14:04 Obviously it's got to be better than fossil fuel use, but may be seen as retaining market monopoly from a Republican point of view. They can't keep clinging to oil. Maybe the area was recently badly flooded and people are keen for change?
4526 2018-12-06 17:13:59 Exactly. He never tried to hide the fact that he hated oil, drilling, pipelines, and fossil fuels.
4527 2018-12-06 17:13:55 Oil service sector , OSX, is trading at March 2009 lows.  Many companies in that sector are trading as if equity will be wiped out ahead.
4528 2018-12-06 17:13:50 Came in to get an oil change at Walmart around 10:30. Told my boss I might be late if they take longer than an hour.

Then I saw my boss at Walmart. 

"Hey....I'm still waiting"
"Ok cool...hey you don't see me here"
"Ok cool"

4530 2018-12-06 17:13:43 Likely because we encourage technological advancements. Now, who gets money from wall street, banks, oil, guns, and private prisons? yeah, that's more republican. Even Cortez spoke out about the issue of lobbyists buying congress folk.
4531 2018-12-06 17:13:40 This is a true fact! There was only enough oil to lube up Channing Tatum for Magic Mike, but through the miracle of Hanukkah there was enough oil for 8 whole sequels. 

@alilikewhoa
4532 2018-12-06 17:13:40 This was the first essential oil I ever bought, it is something I use daily and I don’t know what life would be without it. Peppermint is becoming my second favorite

4542 2018-12-06 17:12:43 Good luck.  The Saudis gave $100 Million to Ivanka's fund when Trump visited.  He announced it during a televised ceremony. The Saudis prop up his hotel & condo business worldwide not to mention supporting his phony oil claims by pumping more or less based on their agreements.
4543 2018-12-06 17:12:40 Frontals be so bomb on IG. They would be even better if you didn’t have to get a oil change on it every week

4548 2018-12-06 17:12:07 Our government now imports illegal immigrants and deadly diseases. / So I'll overthrow you for oil, Mastercards, and Visas
4549 2018-12-06 17:11:58 You can probably make up for it by shotgunning a pint of oil and spinning the ol' laser dreidel.
4550 2018-12-06 17:11:56 That right there is yer problem son.
Scotland if not in UK would be after Norway the richest country by population in the EU.
You fucking idiots are letting westminster take 92% of our oil.
Thats over 500BILLION in 50 years.
You really should check these things for yer bairns.
4551 2018-12-06 17:11:45 Joe Gomez agrees to oil cut, waits for Russia to commit
4552 2018-12-06 17:11:38 I hate this administration. Oil drilling is back on the table. If only hair piece and Bush sr. Switched places in the ceremony yesterday
4553 2018-12-06 17:11:35 If the Japanese were planning on taking over America, they would have failed miserably. Attacking PH just pissed the US off. Plus, they missed the oil supply, which would have crippled our fleet. Bad planning.
4554 2018-12-06 17:11:34 Cook some rice noodles, while they’re cooking sauté your choice veggies in soy sauce, sesame oil, and sriracha, toss the noodles in the pan to finish. Make a quick sauce with soy, sesame, sriracha, and a spoonful of peanut butter. Toss and enjoy
4555 2018-12-06 17:11:30 Looks nice but can you just drain out that gallon of oil ?

4566 2018-12-06 17:11:00 Peppermint essential oil may help for motion sickness.
4567 2018-12-06 17:10:55 Alioli e peperoncini. Chop garlic and chilli and warm gently in good olive oil. Toss cooked spaghetti in the mixture and eat. Try not to breathe on anyone or any painted surfaces for a week.
4568 2018-12-06 17:10:52 I HATE GETTING MY OIL CHANGED
4569 2018-12-06 17:10:44 hmm that is not correct, they are waiting fur a number from the Cowboy Putin.  Pretty sure they will announce it tmw. but maby not what all are expecting which makes OIL rally, something more settle instead
4570 2018-12-06 17:10:43 Probably the lower price of oil factoring in here/ the general uptick in the economy means we’re purchasing more foreign goods.

4577 2018-12-06 17:10:27 LOOK AT THE MARKET! .. but oil is down.
4578 2018-12-06 17:10:25 We need more articles like yours for public consumption and in particular for science deniers. As I write this, I got the news that the T Administration plans a major rollback of protection for the sage grouse for the benefit of oil drillers.

4581 2018-12-06 17:10:15 It seems to have made a difference in terms of securing narrow approval in the Senate for the war as many Senators referenced this in justifying their votes.

OTOH, Saddam did invade Kuwait because he thought the country's oil drilling was undercutting Iraqi oil prices... 1/2

4587 2018-12-06 17:09:45 We produce more than they do now. No reason to fear them. U know this so why try to lie about their power over our oil prices!  Honorable u are not!
4588 2018-12-06 17:09:43 The mindlessness of daytrading on margins is the expectation that it is fixed in minutes these things take cycles - same as oil - anyway lunch time - no tariffs there

4590 2018-12-06 17:09:32 I would suggest manufacturing and transportation is where C02 is emitted but they are exempt from downstream emissions...so are Saudi oil imports via diesel tankers...weird eh Jonny
4591 2018-12-06 17:09:31 These are the same assholes that are freaking out because Sirota posted Beto’s oil and gas donations, calling that an attack.
4592 2018-12-06 17:09:30 My thoughts are with the sage grouse, who’s population you will decimate with the EPA protections rollback for oil drilling
4593 2018-12-06 17:09:29 My apartment runs on green power, i use public transport which is soon to be fully electric. ALL our powerplants run 100% green .. so whats your point, i find it incredibly easy to miss out on coal or oil

4595 2018-12-06 17:09:15 Can you imagine if we reinstated the 40 year ban on crude exports? We would not need any Mid East oil. The US could achieve energy independence. We wouldn’t have to support human right abuse.

4599 2018-12-06 17:08:55 No entendiste el punto,a cuestión es estratégica por lo siguiente
1) la exploración y producción depende de si las empresas ojo pueden y quieran invertir, insisto en el caso Sierra Oil
2) no existen mecanismos para cuantificar realmente cuanto extraen, estamos a la buena fe

4606 2018-12-06 17:08:37 If it was about oil, one wonders why neither of the Bushes pushed to open exploration in ANWR as well as drilling off the Atlantic coast.
4607 2018-12-06 17:08:35 Hey guys! Finals week is so stressful but we have something to help! Take a break from studying and come to Eykamp from 1-4 to our relaxation event! There will be FREE massages, essential oil stations, coloring pages, yoga, and stress relieving toys! Hope to see you there!
4608 2018-12-06 17:08:34 Good news. 

All the other countries only want to exploit Syria and it would likely just continue in chaos and the Syrian ppl will be the only losers or continue to be the only losers. 

Could be why Russia along with low oil are creating disturbances in Ukraine etc.
4609 2018-12-06 17:08:31 Im becoming one of those crazy oil lady's... this is bad. 
4610 2018-12-06 17:08:29 Even modern day snake oil salesmen are ashamed of what Farooq Abdullah is doing these days. This dotard by his knavish tricks and clownish comic performance is in the market with Ram as a new commodity. Hilarious !
4611 2018-12-06 17:08:16 There are numerous types of agreements involving crude oil purchases... it depends mostly on the clients request and financial preferences...
4612 2018-12-06 17:08:13 Color me shocked, because I was guessing it was @SenSasse again, or @BobCorker  or another one of those clowns, but for the bought and sold Senator from Big Oil and Gas to say this is a start.
4613 2018-12-06 17:08:07 Keep buying your oil from countries that murders gays, women and has one of the worst environment and human rights record on the planet then.  Does that make you feel better about yourself? These blatantly ignorant comments are what has gotten us to this point.
4614 2018-12-06 17:08:04 Dear Resident. Oil prices are DROPPING because global demand is SLOWING. And because global economies are SLOWING, global markets are FALLING.  Even Larry Kudlow knows that much.
4615 2018-12-06 17:07:59 I hope all the MAGA folks watch “Dam Yankees” over the weekend and realize what they have done to our country!  You all bought snake oil!

4618 2018-12-06 17:07:53 @truthout ... i appreciate your efforts fighting big tobacco.  But maybe it’s time to refocus and go after Big Oil?  Would be a shame to save all these people from lung cancer only to have them all die with the rest of us in the coming #Climatechange apocalypse... don’t ya think?
4619 2018-12-06 17:07:45 Can oil prices at least go up
4620 2018-12-06 17:07:43 I’m getting my oil change and the receptionist gone say “ Renika “ your car is ready.  I’m sorry, My name is pronounced “Rekendrick” mam!
4621 2018-12-06 17:07:38 นอนมั้ย
4622 2018-12-06 17:07:36 It is also important to know how many of the missing barrels represent oil as against finished product as this could assist in the tracking whether offshore or on shore or both.
4623 2018-12-06 17:07:24 #BREAKING Saudi Arabia says "not confident" that agreement on oil output cuts can be reached
4624 2018-12-06 17:07:23 Like, you see what's wrong with buying oil from bad ppl...

But you don't see the irreparable harm being done to the environment, which will have horrendous consequences for people across the world. 

Will AB be the first to welcome climate refugees? Highly doubt it. Hypocrisy
4625 2018-12-06 17:07:17 Yep those oil companies and their carbon pollution sure are tricky.
4626 2018-12-06 17:07:15 Breaking News: The Trump administration plans a major rollback of protections for the sage grouse, potentially opening 9 million acres to oil drilling.
4627 2018-12-06 17:07:13 Alberta is pissed and wants to extract and sell ever more oil because they have not experienced effects of global climate change. + oceans for Albertans are merely roads to transport their stuff to where it can be refined & burned into the air, so, ocean degradation, who cares...

4629 2018-12-06 17:07:06 Yes those factors i think are triggers however the big trigger has been $usd strength led by weak EMs.  I am not a buyer that oil prices would have met the same fate if $usd was weaker in the preceding 6 months.
4630 2018-12-06 17:07:04 You want to have state sponsored oil infrastructure? Isn't that #socialism?
4631 2018-12-06 17:06:59 Got two! Quorn Swedish meatballs with spaghetti and red chilli pesto.  Simple and so quick and tasty  ....or tiger prawns fried in olive oil,  garlic and chilli. Then stir in spaghetti or linguine. Faves in our house
4632 2018-12-06 17:06:58 oil companies are going to oil... that's what they know... that's what they do.

best to let them go the way of big tobacco (some went into junk food, go figure) and instead prop up the NEW companies who understand renewables and how to make them work... re-training who we can.

4638 2018-12-06 17:06:46 #microsoft "loves Linux" like AT&T claimed it "supports net neutrality" (while actively attacking it) and oil companies pretend to be green. Microsoft has long hired liars, crooks, and criminals with zero sense of morality. None of that has changed.
4639 2018-12-06 17:06:43 Heard the question was on Donald Trump.. but the Saudi minister himself named Modi .. what kind of an impact Modi must have had on the oil production
4640 2018-12-06 17:06:42 You mean Standard Chartered ??   City are clear proven family oil dopers. LFC have no connection to Sponsors only business. You have no fans so you must source revenue from dodgy family deals. Your club have never denied it #cheats
4641 2018-12-06 17:06:39 Sorry Sweetie, but age of oil, is far from the end. Not in your children's, children's, children's, children's life time. You have been listening to the wrong college professor. Coal, the same thing. If you don't like it, then try not buying it,  a lot harder than it seems.
4642 2018-12-06 17:06:37 When you need new winter tires:
Dealership: you also need a million things fixed including brakes & if you do it today only we'll take $500 off $2500

4643 2018-12-06 17:06:35 Oil prices are not determine only by supply and demand (20% ) a supplication and geopolitical factors play a vital role.
that is why the OPEC meetings are not as important as they used to be
4644 2018-12-06 17:06:34 In 2020, Trumps largest donors within the United States will come from within the fossil fuel industry. The oil companies in particular. They will owe him big time.

4647 2018-12-06 17:06:15 @MrAbuSidiq What is the business of the Senate in the payment of arrears for oil marketers?
A back door approach to tax the oil marketers for campaign money.
This time we will do without refined products if this is what will get us to the Next Level

4650 2018-12-06 17:06:08 That’s coz they want to snatch the pie from Iran coz we import most from them. Besides, Saudi oil exports are getting stifled and they need money now.
4651 2018-12-06 17:06:02 Hes close his oil short 
4652 2018-12-06 17:06:02 Great News! I wish other oil rich countries as Iran could learn from them. This should be the future of energy. No matter how hard Trumpians all over the world try eventually the truth will come up. As the scientific data about “EARTH IS NOT FLAT!” more than 300 years ago!

4656 2018-12-06 17:05:32 ntm it's been pretty common knowledge/national news beto ran wo pac money, seems like sirota wouldn't have to specify

also: kinda missing the point, we don't care bc we thought it was pac money (tho that would be bad too) but bc it was oil and gas money
4657 2018-12-06 17:05:30 While I was getting my oil changed today I spoke with a man in his 80s who told me that over the course of his life he and his wife fostered over 157 kids, conversations with strangers never fail to amaze me
4658 2018-12-06 17:05:26 It bothers me that the Democrat rising stars that brunch Twitter are fawning over is the guy who drafted the '94 crime bill, a senator who allowed illegal slave labor to happen under her watch as attorney general and an oil money recipient who couldn't beat Ted fucking Cruz
4659 2018-12-06 17:05:26 hi! if your year end list doesn’t include sophie’s oil of every pearl’s un-insides please consider discarding your list & opinions to the trash : where it belongs.

4662 2018-12-06 17:05:19 Yes thanks, I’m home now. Water pipe blew off apparently and no oil. Near blew the engine up. I check these things like water and oil, dont know what happened. Thank goodness for those guys phew!
4663 2018-12-06 17:05:16 He does?

What policy positions does he support?

#M4A? No.
#GreenNewDeal? No.
#TuitionFreeCollege? No.
Heavy regulation of Big Money?

Is he an advocate for #MMT? No. 

Is he for #PalestinianRights? No.

He takes lots of money from Oil executives and rolls over for APAIC tho.

4669 2018-12-06 17:04:52 I think Nigerians would also like to know if you would "FULLY" deregulate the oil sector and get rid of fuel subsidies? Will the oil industry function like any other competitive business all over the world?

4671 2018-12-06 17:04:43 [She just smiles and makes her way down his back, working on each muscle until they're soft and relaxed. The scent of the oil fills the air with the soft glow of the candles.]

4680 2018-12-06 17:04:11 Out of everything,,,, only short oil
4681 2018-12-06 17:04:10 No, they can use renewable energy to make it. I read that even if they don't it's vastly cleaner than burning fossil fuels. The big question is: If they know of a renewable, clean replacement to oil and gas, why is it being blocked?
4682 2018-12-06 17:04:08 Can you live your life comfortably as today without crude oil. When do you plan to give up fossil fuel?
Your CO2-AGW gurus are not willing to give up fossil fuel based comforts. Being hypocrites they simply badmouth CO2-AGW ClimateChange phantom.
4683 2018-12-06 17:04:08 @ClimateReality Arctic & ocean drilling concerns me as I think this could cause catastrophic events for our planet. Am I being paranoid or could Trump make the movie "2012" a reality with his overzealous oil drilling?
4684 2018-12-06 17:04:08 willow is notorious in our home for THROWING UP EVERYWHERE. and coughing up hairballs all the time. so i started putting a lil coconut oil in her wet food and now only one of us expels unexpectedly.

BTW the US has lowered emissions under trump
4687 2018-12-06 17:03:43 Gotcha. Comparison should prob be limited to what it would be replacing in someone's diet (a standard hamburger). No cholesterol in IB, but the coconut oil makes saturated fat be similar. Calories, protein and iron very similar. Mainly pushing back on orig arg that macros are bad
4688 2018-12-06 17:03:33 Yeah I'm sure the 800 pt drop in the Dow has nothing to do with the oil selloff.  Oil is a risk asset btw.

4701 2018-12-06 17:02:42 $1.91 here and heard on radio this morning that oil was down another $1.25 per barrel. I remember as a kid seeing gas for 19.9 cents per gallon and 35 cents per gallon when I first started driving. Given inflation probably cheaper today.
4702 2018-12-06 17:02:28 Bani gala sey??? These are on going drillings for oil.
4703 2018-12-06 17:02:28 Saudi oil minister says still no agreement, discussing around 1m b/d including Russia and rest of non-Opec, but said, “not confident” and tomorrow’s meeting could take all day #OOTT
4704 2018-12-06 17:02:26 These are individual contributions from people who work in that industry. It is NOT from corporations or corporate interests in that industry which Beto took $0 from. Beto ranks high because he raised a ton of small dollar donations from people in Texas, an oil producing state.
4705 2018-12-06 17:02:25 Amazing! I love chilli and garlic oil!
4706 2018-12-06 17:02:24 Put a little of oil add ground garlic, sofrito and Tomato sauce let it fry for like 30 seconds 

Then add a can of beans, water and beef gravy mix, salt and pepper

4708 2018-12-06 17:02:20 When buying motor oil, here's something you need to know: the "W" after a number refers to winter, not weight. The lower the number, the better the oil's flow-rate, or viscosity, in low temperatures.
4709 2018-12-06 17:02:18 I supported Bernie as a Senator until he copied Trump’s slander against Hillary, trying to discredit her w/ lies about oil, affair & emails, then changed in a debate & acted like he was on her side saying “people are tired of hearing about emails” only bc he knew she was winning.
4710 2018-12-06 17:02:12 My big prediction is that a certain oil rich country is going to center stage in the upcoming Mueller actions. I said a long time ago this was all about fracking and I stand by that now. It's not about nations it's about the climate crisis and the corruption literally fueling it.
4711 2018-12-06 17:02:06 that oil i got smell bombbbb

4717 2018-12-06 17:01:14 1/2 Growth is not reversing - agree. But the inflation profile is non-threatening and indeed decelerating more than U.S. that’s a problem for financial mkts where the Fed is not in a situation to do an aboutface.  Also, imo oil prices dont fall this much

4720 2018-12-06 17:01:07 He’s smart to require congress, not him, to be the ones who screws up our important alliance with the Saudis. That will hurt the oil prices too. But there’s many dumb people in America who listen to #FakeNews and subvert what’s best for America for politics.
4721 2018-12-06 17:00:57 With the US and Russia among top 3 #oil producers, #OPEC influence is waning and will decline further as we approach peak demand in next few years. The pantomime in Vienna is staging its final acts.
4722 2018-12-06 17:00:53 Jesus, did you read it? That's not what it says. It says bitumen isn't very flammable, unlike oil from Bakken, which is what that train was carrying. They have banned certain cars to prevent another one, which is great for flammable oil. Don't need that for bitumen. Irritating
4723 2018-12-06 17:00:53 For those on a budget, you can forgo the espresso machine and get a French press. Still buy the best coffee beans you can afford.

4731 2018-12-06 17:00:18 i dunno about for no other reason-- does Trump owe favors to anyone who's interested in keeping oil demand high?
4732 2018-12-06 17:00:17 I'm big into oil. I own lots of it and I know what it smells like. It's rich smelling. The smell itself spawns property and mansions.
4733 2018-12-06 17:00:16 Ooooh  such an ugly word, I'm crushed. Better go throw this used motor oil on the fire to make myself feel better. Then it's off on a special trip to go club baby harp seals and flick buggars on you Nazi zombies.

4756 2018-12-06 16:59:22 That is very right. Some of the aforementioned (in the latter part) are fast having alternatives which are eco-friendly too. Perhaps more eco-friendly.

The main point for me is that Nigeria should look beyond Oil as a main source of revenue generation.
4757 2018-12-06 16:59:13 The more diversified your economy is the less the crash of individual industries will effect you. Foe example if there was a crash in the oil industry and the only source of income a country had was oil that whole country would immediately be impoverished almost over night.

4802 2018-12-06 16:56:37 If you get the American people off oil you control them. More societies brought out of poverty due to oil which is continually made and not just fossil. Scare tactics; Ice Age-60's, starvation/overpopulation 70's, climate change now- all fraud, all about control!

4877 2018-12-06 16:50:43 When you get discounts on your oil change cuz they’re impressed you drive stick 
4878 2018-12-06 16:50:40 Well, it was crude oil, but refined one so it wouldn’t have helped much.
4879 2018-12-06 16:50:33 No I am a republican. And would be happy to have Pence. Trumps trade war and anti oil zealotry is destroying Texas and Oklahoma.

4882 2018-12-06 16:50:15 This 70% state in gdp has been debunked several times as over estimate. BOFIT for example puts fig at about 40%. Separately they found Russia economy remarkable like Norway (which also has shitload of gas) ie gas/oil is important but it ain’t Saudi Arabia

4890 2018-12-06 16:49:35 OPEC waiting for Putin to show up to give his blessing on supply cuts. Putin will do this to demonstrate his economic relevance on the world stage. Oil stocks will rally tomorrow in my opinion. #oilstocks #putin #opec #stockmarket
4891 2018-12-06 16:49:29 Guys, if a pot full of oil catches on fire, don't carry it to the sink and turn on the faucet. I heard from this friend I know that what happens is the flames shoot straight up into the air and burn my parents' kitchen ceiling.
4892 2018-12-06 16:49:29 I should be studying but I'm angrily listening to a doTerra "wellness advocate" about how beneficial the dumb essential oil thing is to ur health

4894 2018-12-06 16:49:22 Please this a time we should go towards muslim country like iran he is able to give us oil and gas on cheap prices when our oil and gas prices down all economy run on oil and gas prices so less prices bring prosperity in our country most of Pakistani people money burn on oil
4895 2018-12-06 16:49:21 Bitch I was so high I rubbed tanning oil all over my hair so it wouldn’t get burnt
4896 2018-12-06 16:49:19 He should establish an oil servicing company for his mum at Lekki free trade zone? Guy go wash evening plates night don come.

4914 2018-12-06 16:47:37 I need a weed pen and the oil...somebody pull up with it
4915 2018-12-06 16:47:33 I hear you & thx. Times like this put Hussman in my ear and acid in my stomach.  Time for tequila on the lips? Anyway, I've been selling puts in oil service ETFS for last month in what will now be a wounded starter position handed to me in Jan 2019.  Will sell calls immediately.

4922 2018-12-06 16:47:10 They're doing some good shit with brine-farmed algae biofuel. (oil companies are, confusingly, funding some of the best new energy tech it's just... they keep... selling... oil)
4923 2018-12-06 16:47:06 Combo of quitting drinking, acupuncture, and lavender essential oil have helped me get it under control. I had forgotten what it felt like to be in my body without anxiety. These things helped.
4924 2018-12-06 16:47:02 This is one of the Presidents flaws. He believes so much in the art of the deal he can negotiate with anyone including the left.  It’s an ideological impasse. Communism and Capitalism are opposites; oil and water.

4928 2018-12-06 16:46:35 Y ahora Salinas y Black Rock vendieron Sierra oil & gas en miles de millones de dolares a una empresa Alemana sin haber extraído un sólo barril de crudo!

1 tin of chickpeas
1 onion
A little olive oil and some ras al hanout

4932 2018-12-06 16:46:05 They love to destroy my bonsai in the summer. I use neem oil and soapy water to repel em
4933 2018-12-06 16:46:03 I just threw half of my portfolio into oil, can I be an oil baron yet?
4934 2018-12-06 16:46:00 True. Back in the 1980's the Germans were feeding the seed meal from canola oil to their cattle. They had to stop, because it was causing the cattle to grow cancerous tumors.
4935 2018-12-06 16:45:58 Any idea when CBD oil products will return to the online store?
4936 2018-12-06 16:45:55 There key is that they never became an asset for either side in the Cold War. They reject colonial corporate investments. And on particular, they banned drilling for oil. So they are free of the predations of the petroleum industry.

4938 2018-12-06 16:45:41 TRUMP wishes : Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted .But your oil exploration is stopped in America ,the oil price is too low for them to compete ?
4939 2018-12-06 16:45:36 RE: oil names, any thoughts (good/bad/indifferent) on $NBR ? TIA.
4940 2018-12-06 16:45:27 Wooooow I had my tire fixed and oil changed by nine and I’m eating breakfast.
4941 2018-12-06 16:45:25 “People pray for cake... but when God gives them eggs, oil, butter, batter, a pan and an oven they get frustrated and leave the kitchen.”
4942 2018-12-06 16:45:25 If we simply had transparent regulations that made pipeline construction a non-issue, plus an equalization system that wasn’t rigged....that would be more than enough for us to compete. Oil is a volatile business. Anyone who lives in AB has to be prepared for that.
4943 2018-12-06 16:45:19 I wanna take a picture of this French Toast but i feel like I gotta put motor oil on it now to do it justice 
4944 2018-12-06 16:45:12 Cooked pasta, raw onion, avocado, tomatoes, chopped up small, oil, lemon juice, salt n pepper.
4945 2018-12-06 16:45:08 I've supported most of Jeromy's initiatives but I'd be embarrassed to vote yes to a motion that parrots how ethical and responsible our oil is, incites further conflict between municipalities, and seeks to distribute propaganda at city facilities and vehicles.
4946 2018-12-06 16:44:52 You people ever think of getting into some else other than oil. If not its time you start one track mind people there..
4947 2018-12-06 16:44:45  I don’t know the answer. I remember NBC announcing Breaking News discovery and miraculously silence descended upon the oil
4948 2018-12-06 16:44:44 Someone explain what I heard....Canada oil fields to cut 1200 jobs because Canada is only selling at 10.00 per barrel when everyone else is selling for 50.00 per barrel....uh shouldn't everyone be buying canadian oil then? #lies

4952 2018-12-06 16:44:29 you know what would produce 100% fewer emissions? Getting rid of oil & gas entirely. Investments in renewable energy are at an all time high. Your time is running out.
4953 2018-12-06 16:44:26 Having a car is not fun. Buying new wheels, oil change , filters and all that good stuff cost money. Much rather take the MTA but in the 305 there’s no such thing
4954 2018-12-06 16:44:23 your forehead produces Mazola Vegetable Oil
4955 2018-12-06 16:44:20 Not sure why such emphasis on conventional peaking.  We continue to need in excess of 100 million barrels of oil per day and that number continues to grow.  Look at some charts that compares other energy sources to crude (solar, wind, nuclear) that show they are minuscule.

4966 2018-12-06 16:43:24 I honestly don't use anything and it breaks a lot
 I don't use products because most of them contain coconut oil or concentrates which I am allergic too. I just use Shea butter, baby oil and aloe vera. Lavender oil and Rosemary oil work too

4972 2018-12-06 16:43:02 I was amazed by what I read about acid rain and all the harmful material in the air that's going into the ocean and damaging habitats as well as creatures. I'm sure jet ski's do play a role in some of the gas and oil that's in the the ocean.

4987 2018-12-06 16:42:13 To me it’s just different ways to get oil , China is using money, US is using military force. Seems in American court, the former is illegal.
4988 2018-12-06 16:42:13 Oil is only a commodity & it's price too depends on demand & supply.

How n why financial markets bleeding on panic of slowdown that is just half truth.
Demand supply is the real issue ,lower prices r good 4 emerging economy's

4999 2018-12-06 16:41:29 Yes, James Baker reminded us of the jobs George H.W. Bush refused to finish.

He refused to declare victory against the Soviet Union when the Berlin Wall came down and in Iraq refused to take Saddam out after he torched the Kuwaiti oil fields.

Great reminders there James.

5013 2018-12-06 16:40:33 Demand for hydrocarbon energy will continue to increase until past 2040. It is impossible for renewables to take their place. I agree investing in and developing renewable energy is worthwhile, but we’ll continue to need oil and gas. Canadian oil is ethical and responsible.
5014 2018-12-06 16:40:29 That's why I slept at kalmax, opposite YMCA, cool everything. But never ate wandegeya chips that's fried in cooking oil of last month 
5015 2018-12-06 16:40:26 Broccoli pasta (bit of garlic in the oil and pecorino to finish, not if you’re vegan obviously)

5018 2018-12-06 16:40:23 I was taken off tramadol 100mg three times a day to nothing after several years. I know it's not the strongest med but I still had chiropractic help and therapy.  Off everything now and only use cbd oil and it helps so much better than anything I have ever tried..not joking
5019 2018-12-06 16:40:20 Jamaican Black Castor Oil brand Curling Cream is rlly nice and doesn't flake. Don't think it can replace gel exactly but for twists outs its great and im sure if you use it sparingly you could repurpose it for wash n go and dem curl defining sumn deh. Wudnt rec to lay edges tho
5020 2018-12-06 16:40:20 My roommate keeps trying to feed salmon oil to my dog. Has girl never heard of bioaccumulation?
5021 2018-12-06 16:40:20 Or that James Bay is about 5 times the TOTAL mineable area of the oil sands. I am not against hydro, but that area is permanently changed. There is no plan to return to Equivalent Use.
5022 2018-12-06 16:40:12 So in a nutshell India gets oil and Iran gets peanuts.
5023 2018-12-06 16:40:11 For those of you coming on here wanting me to buy something from you...I make essential oil bath soaps,want to buy some?Im not here to shop,read my bio.

5025 2018-12-06 16:40:01 Gusto mo yon? Kakatapos ko lang mag extract tapos sobrabg init na ng braso ko dahil sa oil na yun
5026 2018-12-06 16:40:01 The world needs a price on carbon emissions, which are externalized in the current economy. We will all suffer for the CO2 being dumped in the atmosphere, but you and the fossil fuel execs getting rich off oil/coal/gas will be gone by then. So I guess you don’t care.
5027 2018-12-06 16:39:56 Modi in 50 hours in Argentina participated in G20...he met Saudi prince one o one for india' oil requirement ...he met xi jinping one o one ...in trilateral meeting, Modi  met Japan' Abe & Trump in what Modi called as JAI ...After 12 years, trilateral meeting was held between
5028 2018-12-06 16:39:52 No the oil Doug 
5029 2018-12-06 16:39:36 Not every girl is matured enough to deal with the source

5031 2018-12-06 16:39:33 Mix equal parts honey and coconut oil for the best lip mask you’ll ever use, thank me later
5032 2018-12-06 16:39:30 You make it yourself or buy it in bag? I like to make it the old fashioned way, a little coconut oil and popcorn in a pan. Then melted butter and occasionally garlic salt and Parmesan cheese.
5033 2018-12-06 16:39:25 Thought Drai looked tired last night
5034 2018-12-06 16:39:20 Oh. My. God.

Look at this fake, pompous, popular douchebag wolf man.

"ThAt'S a HuGe MiLeStOnE." SHUTTHEFUCKUP!

Of COURSE you're reaching 5k when you're a tail wagging, oil & rubber wearing suck up kiss ass!

You know what's REALLY difficult? Trying to hit 1K while being angry!
5035 2018-12-06 16:39:19 With falling oil prices and your ramped up  climate rhetoric, this looks like a soft sell to eventually introduce a carbon tax, and another CCX styled carbon exchange to benefit you and your globalist buddies
5036 2018-12-06 16:39:18 now myself i like to use a special corn oil blend that can be used both to pop and also as a topping which i mix half and half with some salted butter.  the trick is you have to let the oil really heat up before you toss in the kernels
5037 2018-12-06 16:39:15 งอแงมากเหมือนกันนะ
5038 2018-12-06 16:39:01 CRUDE OIL

After literally fabricating the EIA crude oil draw, I think WTI will NOT be allowed to drop below $50 until tomorrow end of day, when OPEC meeting is over.
5039 2018-12-06 16:38:59 Arrabiata - a little fresh or dry chilli  heated with fresh garlic in oil (the olive oil from tin if using achovies), passats, fresh or dried basil add olives as be thou wont or don't, but ditch the pasta...unnecessary.
5040 2018-12-06 16:38:57 Cancelling the carbon tax powered global oil prices? Wow.
5041 2018-12-06 16:38:48 Corrección: Blackrock rechaza oferta de recompra del gobierno. 

Quedaron ardidos con la perdida de Sierra oil & Gas por presuntamente recibir información de un yacimiento de mas de mil millones de barriles en su concesión.
5042 2018-12-06 16:38:45 Is CBD oil legal in the UK?
5043 2018-12-06 16:38:44 This is film of road work for pit and surface coal mining in the Appalachians.
#carhartt supports coal mining and oil industry fossil fuels.
5044 2018-12-06 16:38:43 #bcpoli @cknw @bc1 @jonmccomb980 so oil is  6% of the Canadian Economy -- wow listening to the pipeline hype one would thing it would be 50%
5045 2018-12-06 16:38:42 ما حدا قال غير هيك بس اذا ما بدهم يلتفوا بكونوا متلهم متل الإسرائيلي لا بل اتعس
5046 2018-12-06 16:38:30 Both sides of science? Sooo the right side and the wrong side? WTF... Does she believe anyone with half a functioning neuron actually falls for this BS? I mean other than oil/coal billionaires and the aggressively ignorant. This is why schools need to teach critical thinking.
5047 2018-12-06 16:38:19 guess tax cuts, interest rate hikes, tariffs, low oil prices, Brexit and global slow down do not mix well
5048 2018-12-06 16:38:08 There is "YOUR CLIMATE CHANGE", why should Americans Cut-down on 
Gas, Oil and Coal use. When no-one else does?
5049 2018-12-06 16:38:00 *while the pan was on fire*

Mind: ano nga ulit yung fire extinguisher type for oil/grease?

Hirap ng laging distracted.
5050 2018-12-06 16:37:58 That’s just silly. There’s no oil on Titan. It’s all short chain hydrocarbons. Acetylene-ammonia is a rocket fuel that the Russians call astetam. There’s no readily available oxidiser on Titan. It’d need to be made from ice. To stretch the oxygen further maybe nitrous oxide.
5051 2018-12-06 16:37:54 $CAD has been beaten down so much, the moment we get just a bit of positive news on their Oil crisis, I think we could see quite the reversal
5052 2018-12-06 16:37:52 India still owes a tonne of debt in oil bonds to Iran due to the big goof up done by UPA. Modi is cleaning up that mess  it imported 25 million times of crude and its still paying an staggering  $6.4 billion to clear it . So it has to seek additional sources at cheaper rates
5053 2018-12-06 16:37:43 Is this all about oil?
5054 2018-12-06 16:37:43 idk how many ppl know but coconut oil can be a good deodorizer/preventative under the armpits for those w sensitive skin
5055 2018-12-06 16:37:41 Also try to remember not to buy palm oil products this Christmas if you can guys 
5056 2018-12-06 16:37:38 What’s a good oil to use for my braids?!
5057 2018-12-06 16:37:37 Well soon only the US of A will be the major user of oil
5058 2018-12-06 16:37:33 We wouldn’t go there anyway, there’s no oil there!
5059 2018-12-06 16:37:29 Rashid was created due to a generous contribution of oil money. He will never be a bad character.

5061 2018-12-06 16:37:15 bot oil at 50.
5062 2018-12-06 16:37:11 Yet oil equities have leprosy.  Trump will lose Texas and Oklahoma.
5063 2018-12-06 16:37:08 Indeed you would be loved if you were Big oil like the Bush family or Central banking like the Bush family? Or Skull & Bones like the front & center politician's. They will portray a great legacy for such well paid puppets.
5064 2018-12-06 16:37:02 G'day, Charles.  Looking forward to your program today.  Please feel free to discuss oil price direction all you wish!?  Thank you.
5065 2018-12-06 16:36:53 I wonder how your billionaires & millionaires in the oil business like this? How much money did they give you???
5066 2018-12-06 16:36:52 FINALE. - peppermint oilってタイトルでバリクソ強いアートコア作って節目に(?)
5067 2018-12-06 16:36:43 @LindseyGrahamSC spots didn't change. Lindsey over a Non-Citizens terrorist your going to sabotage this country by trying to eliminate an Isreal Ally & millions of barrels our oil daily.
Let's say Saudi's tell us how to discipline, make our laws who can be in office. #NotOurFight
5068 2018-12-06 16:36:38 We stir in a tin of mackerel in olive oil/tomato sauce and add in whatever green is in the fridge.
5069 2018-12-06 16:36:31 Send someone to check up on them. They’re probably playing ping pong in there, while oil prices fall .. to satisfy Trump a little 
5070 2018-12-06 16:36:31 You have zero clue.  Charles doesn’t a squirt of $8?! about Canada.  Best thing to happen is blocking Canadian oil exports. Pine bend refinery makes all the money on price differential. Cheap oil in expensive gas/diesel out. Billions in his pocket.
5071 2018-12-06 16:36:31 Are you fucking kidding me with that amateur hour bullshit I'm surprised you can eat your popcorn and instead you don't just choke and die and then go to hell for using coconut oil
5072 2018-12-06 16:36:30 I doubt that the oil sheeks in Saudi Arabia lost 600,000 barrels of oil. Seem like we have some here
5073 2018-12-06 16:36:25 น่าเบื่อนะ
5074 2018-12-06 16:36:22 ويا ريت منضل قلب واحد وايد.وحدة وما نمشي ورا الغرائز المذهبية . الله يهدينا جميعا
5075 2018-12-06 16:36:20 ..this last week I fumbled it like I was playing in the field with oil and vinegar water syrup jelly and any other slippery surface you can think of.. I threw a big flag on myself last night
5076 2018-12-06 16:36:20 Who knows he’s an idiot peddling snake oil that was able to lure farmers car companies sears coal miners @others 2 get him in only to turn his back on middle America because we can stand the pain. I bet his socks cost $100 a pair. He cares about no one but his self.hes a democrat
5077 2018-12-06 16:36:18 Imma get you some oil then... can’t be walking around like that sis 
5078 2018-12-06 16:36:17 Long Crude Oil Futures (Front Month) 50.26

Stop Loss 50.06

Mean reversion trade. Trading well below Daily ATR
5079 2018-12-06 16:36:10 Sounds perfect. The western provinces have the oil, gas and farmland and the US has the military and nukes 
5080 2018-12-06 16:36:10 @konkrumah Hon,can you please tell me how one can apply to be considered for the training in the Oil and Gas training program for 200 graduates to be organised by this Government.
5081 2018-12-06 16:36:01 OIH is trading lower than it was in 2009 -- you need to back off on calling for lower oil prices as it's going to destroy oil services companies and also cause a collapse of the entire stock market.

5084 2018-12-06 16:35:51 PM Modi stressed upon crude oil prices to Saudi officials, it had an impact. Saudi officials declared PM Modis words is taken seriously hence oil prices have been reduced, yes question was bou Pres Trump, PM Modi was mentioned! Impact of Indian leader in the global platform!
5085 2018-12-06 16:35:40 Gotta love that Oil money.. can’t wait till they run out of it.
5086 2018-12-06 16:35:40 Puttanesca. Chilli, garlic, oil. Easy.

5093 2018-12-06 16:34:49 oil free moisturizers are a lifesaver bc they keep your skin hydrated in the cold without clogging pores n causing oily skin or acne! Also witch hazel is a nice remedy for skin in the winter

5095 2018-12-06 16:34:46 Oil
5096 2018-12-06 16:34:37 Disgraceful hypocrisy.

It took an SNP government after 40 years of oil revenues flowing south and being habitually ignored by the unionist party's for this to be built.

If it wasnt for the SNP, the people of the NE would STILL BE WAITING.
5097 2018-12-06 16:34:35 like arsenic mixed with black oil.

5100 2018-12-06 16:34:23 lol, still drilling for oil? Have you not heard that the age of oil is .. no, has to come to an end?
5101 2018-12-06 16:34:22 Equatorial Guinea and Congo are not shitholes because of a lack of oil and minerals, they have these in abundance, they are shitholes because of their low human capital. Japan and Singapore are prosperous because of their human capital and not natural resources.
5102 2018-12-06 16:34:14 Gotta get some gin and cod liver oil to kick this cold man
5103 2018-12-06 16:34:13 me @ my skin,, stop producig excess oil u ugly
5104 2018-12-06 16:34:09 Is it for oil? I bet it's for oil.
5105 2018-12-06 16:34:08 She could have possibly been poisoned by the exploitative, sadistic, parasitic, and predatory Britain, who are full of greed, jealousy, covetousness, and pathological fear of Biafra and Biafrans.
No wonder they murdered over 6 million Biafrans, just to confiscate OIL AND GAS.
5106 2018-12-06 16:34:05 I showed #JMTheJowa my calming oil and he said “Oh your tita juices!” 
5107 2018-12-06 16:34:01 Dude:

a) individuals working the oil/gas industry, not "the industry"
b) #1 was Cruz
c) they were in those slots because they were running for U.S. Senate in Texas, which has more oil/gas employees than any other state.

You are helping to prove the point she is making.
5108 2018-12-06 16:33:58 Glad it worked out for you! Did you use pure tea tree oil? If so where did you get it from and did you dilute it?
5109 2018-12-06 16:33:55 Nothing about lack of refinery capacity in the US, hence the need to transport the oil?
5110 2018-12-06 16:33:49 Yep. When someone points out the mined area of the oil sands, I point to the Equivalent State laws, and point out that Toronto is about the size of mined areas, but there is no plan to put it back to nature. Or that Toronto uses 3 times as much water as the sands.
5111 2018-12-06 16:33:48 A few pipelines actually, Scott. But the part we are so angry with, and will be tough to forget, is the feeling that the rest of your family has just simply abandoned you. So much more complex than what a tweet can describe (and not just oil/gas; farmers/ranchers are irate too)
5112 2018-12-06 16:33:46 Given @O2 have turned the clock back 20 years and turned my smartphone into an expensive paperweight I'm going old school. It's Marathon not Snickers, Opal fruits not starburst Oil of Olay!!
5113 2018-12-06 16:33:42 2.If Canadians care about the enviro impact of oil/gas products, it's beneficial to build pipelines that can transport them safely. We then wouldn’t import from countries (Saudi Arabia) who have fewer enviro restraints/restrictions, & the impact of transporting those saidproducts
5114 2018-12-06 16:33:40 can oil really make a new low  with a 7.x draw ? @chigrl @Lee_Saks
5115 2018-12-06 16:33:33 Oil rich countries they speak of are Authoritarian, the wealth is held by only a few, like in Saudi Arabia, people will starve when the Government is ran by strong man Authoritarian keeping as much $$$, the video doesn't talk about Denmark, Sweden, Norway and many other countries
5116 2018-12-06 16:33:33 You know that you are part of the problem supporting cuts on oil it will put the West in major recession, kill jobs, worst then eightee
5117 2018-12-06 16:33:27 Coffees featured on the coffee bar today include some of the 12 Coffees of Christmas like country Christmas and Decaf Christmas Cookies along with Midnight Oil (Dark Roast), French Roast Decaf and the House Favorite Sunrise Blend. 

Make it a BREWtiful day! 
5118 2018-12-06 16:33:25 Who gets more subsidies, small renewable start ups, or giant entrenched oil companies?
5119 2018-12-06 16:33:24 Right because my legs literally look like snake skin even after applying oil and lotion smh
5120 2018-12-06 16:33:20 I really like the coffee that tastes like engine oil. That really does it for me
5121 2018-12-06 16:33:20 of course not, lets burn oil instead!
5122 2018-12-06 16:33:16 @Francis_Drouin You may want to read this artcle that shows your boss's arrogance, his entitlement, his haughty attitude which are on full display right now.  Notley and Moe joined forces to write to Trudeau demanding the crisis in the oil patch be put on the agenda. Shame on him
5123 2018-12-06 16:33:09 Please #Qatar don’t listen to #Saudis you just increase oil production! Usituache peke yetu  @NurdinSelemani @MariaSTsehai @MarekaMalili

5125 2018-12-06 16:33:04 Pretty simple, though oil cleanup is annoying and comes out delicious. Did gouda this time. Supermarket had similar blocks in mozzarella and cheddar so may try next
5126 2018-12-06 16:32:54 Electricity is just as real as a barrel of oil. Just because you can’t touch it (tangible) doesn’t mean it’s not real or of value. This is the silliest anti-renewables argument I’ve ever heard. 
PS: wind turbines and solar panels produce FAR more energy than they take to produce.
5127 2018-12-06 16:32:46 I do like those and oil sketches of clouds by  Lionel Constable are almost as good
5128 2018-12-06 16:32:44 Hmm... Gimana ya ngejelasinnya
Tau ga kalo kulit yg dehidrasi tu ga hanya bikin kulit kering, tapi juga bisa bikin oily parah. Soal nya makin kekurangan air di kulit wajah, makin banyak produksi sebum(oil)
Jadi muka minyakan parah tapi yg kita rasain tu kering
5129 2018-12-06 16:32:44 Absolutely it is your right to boycott for whatever reason! However, it should be pointed out that alternatives to palm oil pose greater environmental threats at a global scale, and so we do not believe a blanket boycott to be a tool for addressing these impacts.

5135 2018-12-06 16:31:58 with oil.. then appreciated
5136 2018-12-06 16:31:56 I've lost 11+ pounds in the last 9 days.

One of the mainstays of my diet?

That @SeloOils pure Croatian olive oil.

But now I'm out and waiting on my next order like a crack fiend. 

Even Whole Foods doesn't have anything close to a comparable substitute.
5137 2018-12-06 16:31:55 Dont look now but oil is likely to break $50 tonight
5138 2018-12-06 16:31:53 Not as bland as olive oil.  Nice smooth taste! Do you oil pull?
5139 2018-12-06 16:31:48 My Mother set me off on a life-Long love of his drawings and oil sketches when I was 7. At that time we lived 20 mins from the V&A, cities can be wondrous places for small children.
5140 2018-12-06 16:31:47 R3 is providing a certain technology, I can't remember the specifics and ripple is providing xrp as the oil or the thing that makes r3's tech flow.
5141 2018-12-06 16:31:46 I am not too experienced with deep frying but I have deep enough pans to do so with vegetable oil. Just roll the wrapped cheese in flour, dip im egg, panko it then fry for about 5 min
5142 2018-12-06 16:31:46 DIRECTIONS
Whisk eggs and milk together
Coat each piece of cheese with flour, dip in egg, then roll in bread crumbs
Dip in egg and crumbs again
Freeze before frying
Heat oil in skillet. Cook sticks about a min on each side or until golden and before cheese leaks
5143 2018-12-06 16:31:45 Too bad top democratic leaders are bought wholesale by Big Oil and other oligarch forces.
5144 2018-12-06 16:31:44 Guess the Saudis hv been listening to @realDonaldTrump oil sliding towards $50

5153 2018-12-06 16:31:20 Worst part is AS and the CPC r a huge joke, admittedly JT has dropped the oil ball but as usual CPC has no plan just a series of after the fact attacks. Canada needs real leadership so we are screwed
5154 2018-12-06 16:31:19 #INR The markets learn the hard lesson that there is more to life than Oil.

5160 2018-12-06 16:30:08 Ever wondered who needs who in this scenario. I’m sure if Zimbabwe had oil and was buying arms enmasse from US there wouldn’t have been these sanctions. And nobody’s saying US is right or what. We citizens want sanctions removed and our constitution respected and rights respected

5162 2018-12-06 16:29:50 Laundering donations through employees is common, not sure why it’s a conspiracy theory, I’m just done being naive about how politics works for the wealthy who are hell bent on destroying humanity for profit. Anyone adjacent to oil companies is not getting my vote. #Bernie2020
5163 2018-12-06 16:29:50 DID U DRINK OIL. NEVER MIND,JOKING
5164 2018-12-06 16:29:47 Sorry for your plight. Let’s campaign together for the brilliant idea. It’l mean taking on big oil and car companies and their political cronies. Got the idea from @GeorgeMonbiot’s book #Heat.  Better still, take them on at the global sphere @GlobalPeoPow
5165 2018-12-06 16:29:46 1. The demand for oil and gas products won't go away if you stop building pipelines. By blocking pipelines, the industry will just use trains which will simultaneously burn diesel. The trains do not require any approvals to cross borders/rivers and can go wherever they want.
5166 2018-12-06 16:29:39 You are truly deplorable.  History will judge you harshly and the fall of the US economy and demise in health of our planet is on you and others in the oil beholden GOP.  #ClimateAction #ClimateChangeIsReal

1 lb mozzarella cheese, cut into 3/4 inch x 3/4 inch strips
1 cup vegetable oil
5168 2018-12-06 16:29:34 It's amazing the newfound reverence the left has found for George HW Bush now that he's dead. The oil tycoon millionaire, director of CIA who oversaw the war on drugs. The love-in between all the former presidents showing exactly what is wrong with politics.
5169 2018-12-06 16:29:34 You either accept the climate science or you don't. Arguing to maximise North Sea oil & gas for as long as possible - and give its industry more tax breaks - shows that the SNP clearly don't accept the science. Doing better than other countries is meaningless.
5170 2018-12-06 16:29:33 Absolutely.  We toured Arizona parks before the oil wells and mining start.
5171 2018-12-06 16:29:31 It is woefully ignorant to think that the Canadian Economy can just sustain the impact of complete destruction of the oil sands. The obvious need to convert to renewable energy sources and an innovation based economy can happen side-by-side.
5172 2018-12-06 16:29:26 Nations kill their enemies. It’s the way the world works. And powerful nations kill more brazenly. How about our drone strikes on foreign soil? The Saudis have oil power. Society seems to be about survival, not morality.

5181 2018-12-06 16:28:50 I’ve been discounting that since Jan. Fact is things are holding up, valuations are better, Fed is backing off & trade is getting close to being over, and Chinese growth will start to moderate and pressure from oil is over.

5183 2018-12-06 16:28:37 a shot across the bow of the shale drillers?  A reminder that KSA can jack up production quickly and that oil can tank pricing in the US.  maybe less of a reminder to the drillers themselves than their debt and equity investors: enough with the insane capital programs already.

5195 2018-12-06 16:27:56 According to the EIA, the US was a net EXPORTER of crude oil and petroleum products last week. Only 211 MBPD of net exports and these numbers obviously can vary week-to-week, but nonetheless a massive shift from just 10 years ago, when the US was a net importer of ~13 MMBPD.

5222 2018-12-06 16:26:15 Why do you say "disinformation"?

From the Gulf of Tonkin false-flag which killed a million Vietcong & 50k US kids, to fake WMDs which let you kill 2.4 mlln Iraqis & then loot their oil -- you have zero credibility. 

Especially no credibility @carlbildt since you work for @NATO
5223 2018-12-06 16:26:10 You blame OPEC, yet we have more oil than they do.  There is also this new concept of "alternative fuel sources".  Have you heard of it?
5224 2018-12-06 16:26:07 Don't do it man. There is much better product on the market than fantasy guru elite.
They are snake oil salesmen.
5225 2018-12-06 16:26:00 Do you think that the multiple oil company executives who have maxed out to Beto are all stupid or gullible? Do you think that they want to increase regulation on themselves for the common good or something?

Or is it more likely that they know something that you don't?
5226 2018-12-06 16:25:59 Oh come on. We are here because of decades of Congressional greed and bribes from big oil. Watching Democrats point their fingers as if YOU are the 'good guys' is nauseating and a big LIE. Oil made A LOT of you very rich. #WeKnow #VoteForChange #OverhaulCongress #Corruption

Most of the money that funds geological research comes from petroleum industry & goes to the oil prospector.

5281 2018-12-06 16:22:10 The same goes for the Alberta Oil Sands. Places that are not reclaimed are large cities covered with hundreds of miles of concrete and asphalt where most of the so called Green Movement actually live. They like Nature, from a distance.

5288 2018-12-06 16:21:50 Glen, do you think Norway could show leadership or responsibility and voluntarily constrain (stop) export of oil & gas as a strong signal to reduce GHG of its exported products? Is this transition discussed at all in Norway? #COP24
5289 2018-12-06 16:21:45 No. You are not serving the people of Kentucky by making our air dirty & increasing global warming. Let Kentucky & West Virginia become the center of Green Technology. You work for big oil & coal tycoons.The @gop only works for the wealthy. Time people woke up to that. @kygov
5290 2018-12-06 16:21:42 I care. Because their children didn't ask for it. And many bought the snake oil. If they still support Individual 1 they are ridiculous, but again, their children don't deserve it.

5291 2018-12-06 16:21:41 I agree with you and I dont oppose nature conservation. I'm saying science has not yet made green energy sustainable enough to cut out crude oil and natural gas. 

So in order to make that happen, I propose we create a business environment friendly to innovation and development
5292 2018-12-06 16:21:37 I used the oil when I was out of my anti-anxieties. It did the job better than I expected. Since then my girlfriend takes the gummies after more rough work days to help her mood.
5293 2018-12-06 16:21:36 So if govt spends money on project that enriches a few and does nothing for general economy or average citizens, we just shrug. In this way, full use of our money issuing resource could become sort of like an "oil curse" and lots of valueless bloat.

5316 2018-12-06 16:19:38 In fact this gives Alberta 2 separation choices. Try to join the US and likely be sapped for oil and given no representation. Or be a landlocked nation who's economy depends on trading its product to the world... with all its access to the world owned by Canada...
5317 2018-12-06 16:19:37 Exactly where did all the oil money go. The Federal Government made a fortune between 2005 & 2014 and there was barely a cent spent on anything other then oil expansion.

5337 2018-12-06 16:17:57 Did I say that? You are completely clueless! Our taxes play for things like the roads you drive on, the subsidies to oil companies and car companies that allow your gas and car to be cheaper. The taxes also pay for the school you might have attended for 18 years. Do the math.
5338 2018-12-06 16:17:55 Why would you assume that I haven't? For example, I am aware that nine oil industry executives maxed out their donations to him.

5341 2018-12-06 16:17:48 Not one more soldier should die in the name of lower oil prices.  We see you.
5342 2018-12-06 16:17:47 If there is going to be no benefit to allowing more drilling in this country then I would favor closing land to drilling.  If big oil is just going to reap huge profit at the expense of consumers. Broken system. needs to be looked at

5350 2018-12-06 16:17:09 If the USA was energy independent, would they need Saudi Arabia's oil and the wars and military might required to keep it flowing?  How about Canada, USA, and Mexico decide North America doesn't need the middle-east wars and oil and just takes care of the western world in peace?

5359 2018-12-06 16:16:19 Peak oil?  Not even close.  The time before the automobile was not nearly as productive.  Might have been more satisfying, enjoyable, relaxing, rewarding but humans have traded that off for the industrialized world.  Going back is not really an option.

These costs, while high, are not onerous. For Oil sands, its about 10,000/acre. This adds 1 or 2 $/bbl to the costs. 
Note that RE is often the only exemption to these laws. Alberta has just started forcing NEW wind farms to pay for clean up, and there is no orphan fund.

5385 2018-12-06 16:14:29 Absolutely, but that only reinforces the broader point that no president can really take credit for the oil and gas boom. 

I would say, though, that the ability to search for and produce from the best rock on federal lands IS a policy matter, because permitting takes far longer.

5412 2018-12-06 16:12:49 Who's your beard oil dealer bro
5413 2018-12-06 16:12:44 Might be true.  However, if the Gov't wanted it, they could have provided the capital to have a stable/secure/safe oil source.  

It only takes one dispute with the Saudis (a recent one is coming to mind) and Eastern CAN would be screwed for gas. Think of it like a safety net.

5416 2018-12-06 16:12:34 I’ve just received a press release about beard products infused with cannabis oil (CBD) - I’m Bath but I’m not THAT Bath!

5421 2018-12-06 16:12:18 With sufficient inequality, the Jesus model could work to break these structures from the outside. This relies on the premise that resource revenue becomes irrelevant and social interconnection increases. With the trend in oil prices, we may not be very far from this.

La expectativa era de un recorte mucho mayor.
5429 2018-12-06 16:11:22 We ordered rail cars so we can get the oil moving. A pipeline would be 100 times more efficient than rail cars.

5436 2018-12-06 16:10:56 If I have learned anything from Toronto media, it's that small sample size shooting percentages are ALWAYS maintained over a season! Also, say he does, too pricey for Oil then anyway no?

5440 2018-12-06 16:10:44 Of course! But why are they here? Oil companies extract the raw materials and petrochemical companies manufacture the plastic so that supermarkets can save money on packaging. The owners of all these industries number just a few, and they all have names and addresses...
5441 2018-12-06 16:10:42 Trump will be to blame for the thousands of pipelines  , Dirty Coal Mines  , oil drilling platforms now under construction and spewing CO2 into our atmosphere  . Toxins into our waterways  . Trump to be blamed  !

5443 2018-12-06 16:10:42 The problem started long ago. One take I got from the Bernie Climate Change Town Hall is that since the 70s, Oil companies have been spending 40x the money to suppress the progress of electric cars. If we can kneecap their influence, the charging stations will come.
5444 2018-12-06 16:10:33 Well, I know CO2 is for Alpha, AFFF is for Bravo, and PKP is for Charlie. 
-Alpha: Carbon based items including people, hence 'Screaming Alphas.'
-Bravo: oil and petroleum based fires. Best to hit the fire above it to smother the fire.
-Charlie: Electrical fires.
5445 2018-12-06 16:10:24 @JudithLewis Today's big deal.. ... Feds legislated posties back to work but Xmas deliveries in doubt.  .. Alberta oil went up $10/Barrel after Prov government intervened.

5459 2018-12-06 16:09:34 You are mistaking me for some other idiot. I have always believed the Saudis should be held accountable, but the world fears the Saudis because they have the power to raise oil prices and crush economies. I am not afraid and think justice is worth the sacrifice.
5460 2018-12-06 16:09:30 To what end? What does the US get out of it? An economy smaller than Missouri's and all the headache of integration. Odds are they'll treat Alberta as a territory, milk its oil and keep it out of Congress so there is no representation for albertans at all.
5461 2018-12-06 16:09:29 Technology like LN and Atomic Swaps will then start the next hype cycle, exchanges will be ready to handle the onramp traffic thanks to liquid and better TX handling.

5465 2018-12-06 16:09:02 No, unfortunately it’s a prescription. My vet also suggested adding omega 3 oil to food as a supplement (we’re already giving dasuquin supplement), which are OTC.
5466 2018-12-06 16:09:01 2/2 US EIA inventory data: U.S domestic production stalled at 11.7 million barrels a day with no growth in the lower 48 states. Lower prices for oil may have spooked some producers from entering the markets. Watch the next two weeks. OPEC cuts will determine the future growth.

I also get that the worldwide oil industry is still prospering, but one day it won't. If Alberta is behind the curb on cleantech we'll be permanently left behind

5484 2018-12-06 16:07:33 Hot tip I got recently. Hot water first to remove product and wash away some of the natural hair oil. Then cold wash with the Beardbrand products. Gives your hair and skin the love it needs. Can’t wait to test out this hair product.

5488 2018-12-06 16:07:07 Bush opened up oil contracts at the end of his administration. Given that Obama Admin was strapped by an full blown economic depression upon entering office and dealing with high unenemployment, there was little he could do.

5498 2018-12-06 16:05:43 It is true that the oil and gas industry must bear some responsibility for the mess we are in today. Especially those CEO's support for the carbon tax. But mostly it's the politicians elected to govern this country.

5502 2018-12-06 16:05:22 Not logical. Controlling output will not increase prices when there are so  many cheaper (to refine) alternatives. There is a global price of alternatives below which Alberta oil just can't compete. The only help would be a global oil price increase. Not likely.

5538 2018-12-06 16:02:54 Problem with 1) is that the objective is not to minimize long-term oil production (the opposite in fact - since oil producers have no intention / interest in leaving it in the ground). Supply cuts are mainly aimed at medium-term revenue maximization.

5541 2018-12-06 16:02:41 Yes that's true, but many who have even more on their account do not have solar panels to charge their tesla. They have 3 fuel engine cars and burn the hell out of oil heating...so i take her anyday.. I mean, her way of living..
5542 2018-12-06 16:02:38 Oil report needs more attention!
5543 2018-12-06 16:02:35 EIA reports that U.S. commercial crude oil inventories have FALLEN by 7.3 million barrels. That might alleviate some of the downward pressure on crude oil prices. #EagleFord #PermianBasin #HOU #SATX
5544 2018-12-06 16:02:34 And to decide if they should leave or not, O'Connell's character swung his front gate, saying "If this squeaks, it's ours. This gate has never been fixed, my Mom will never oil it."
Gate doesn't squeak, they leave.
Smash cut to his mom thanking her neighbour for oiling the gate.

5555 2018-12-06 16:02:15 Oil!
5556 2018-12-06 16:02:13 Was said earlier this morning! Oil was lower at 10am GMT than now.
5557 2018-12-06 16:02:03 I love tea tree oil  but I'd use it sparingly only because I've heard it can be toxic to dogs and cats, idk if that's proven though. Just heard through the grapevine from coworkers and articles.
5558 2018-12-06 16:01:56 Ask away. The answer is, who cares? Why does Alberta need other Canadians to love it? The US industry has fierce criticis, you don't see the API whining because California doesn't unanimously love oil.

5562 2018-12-06 16:01:50 I would pose that renal denervation and fish oil should be taken off this list for now...

5570 2018-12-06 16:01:30 Assad never did anything to America!  What has America done to Assad?  The Syrian government represents the third regional secular government the US has been involved with trying to overthrow, all due to oil! Right now, America is stealing Syria's oil, as is Israel!

5590 2018-12-06 16:00:32 yeah it may be tricky there, but online stores abound.  also sold as full spectrum hemp oil. I mix my own from CBD isolate and coconut oil.
5591 2018-12-06 16:00:28 We produce most of our own oil already. SA doesn't have a monopoly. However they do own a lot of US  debt and buy our weapons.

All resource extraction in most OECD must follow an "Equivalent Use" law. You cant put things back exactly, hence "equivalent". Its a return to a natural state. 

Oil, mining, logging, even gravel pits and access roads, need to have a plan to return to Equivalent Use.

5609 2018-12-06 15:59:38 Roast some red peppers in the oven, then serve over pasta with sauteed garlic & chilli, olive oil drizzle, black pepper and parmesan. As long as there's enough olive oil to coat it's not dry and it's really easy.
5610 2018-12-06 15:59:37 Exactly, heating oil has not dropped at all even though Crude oil has had the diggest drop in over a decade the past 2 months!  It's called gouging the consumer.  Hell gas prices are only down 5 cents since May! Total screw job!

5613 2018-12-06 15:59:32 Spaghetti with chilli, garlic and olive oil,
5614 2018-12-06 15:59:26 My point: when an intelligent professional journalist whom I respect exaggerates/ misrepresents the nature of a single oil research funding vote by a politician (one running for US Senate in Texas), it's problematic and may limit their credibility. Not hard to be accurate here.
5615 2018-12-06 15:59:25 The colonial masters brought numerous good news that opened our eyes. Though, with it came extortion. But in the process, we were enlightened and exposed to the possibilities of a better and working a "STATE". The discovery of oil and the returns on it scattered and divided

Tune in for Lunch & Learn tomorrow at 12 noon
5617 2018-12-06 15:59:12 Lemon: cook linguine or similar, mix olive oil, a load of Italian hard cheese, chopped basil, black pepper, lemon juice. Mix well, add to cooked hot pasta, dump a load of rocket on top/semi mixed. So quick it’s almost stressful but bloody lovely.
5618 2018-12-06 15:59:12 Utterly irrelevant to what we are talking about now. You either accept climate science and want to save the world or you don't. The SNP pretend to and yet simultaneously demand maximum oil and gas extraction. Hypocritical and irresponsible.
5619 2018-12-06 15:59:09 One side says climate change is terrible and it's going to destroy the world and the other side says the same thing except we can make more money drilling for oil in the Arctic once all the ice is gone.
5620 2018-12-06 15:59:09 Why does not the Oil Rich nations of this world not hold onto modern notions of liberal rights.  Liberal Exremism has made you blind.  It is not a matter of what it, but fact.
5621 2018-12-06 15:59:02 Actually, literally, the world does need higher oil prices to help push us to sanity.

Sometimes pain is good.
5622 2018-12-06 15:58:59 Yay lower oil prices!!

Check the stock market too.

More like America third or fourth.  Maybe fifth.
5623 2018-12-06 15:58:51 Oh hai! Just a little point: there’s not two sides to science...it’s just science. You then weigh the evidence...on one side of that evidence scale we have the “It’s not us” peeps, a few flat earthers and oil and coal companies, the other side “it is us” a Mount Everest of data
5624 2018-12-06 15:58:47 There's an oil prince out there looking for you
5625 2018-12-06 15:58:34 I agree, I still support oil taxes but the messaging has evolved though it still seems scattered. If they could tune that and focus - and not riot - they'd have plenty of support. Wish someone could emerge to help bring it all together but maybe not going to happen.
5626 2018-12-06 15:58:29 Pasta alla checca! Cubed mozzarella mixed with finely chopped fresh tomato and stirred in the hot pasta a crudo! Or mushroom and leek--sautee in oil with garlic and herbs then stir in the pasta al dente... #pastarocks

5660 2018-12-06 15:56:22 ..and this at a time of low oil prices and increased domestic production: 

evidently the corp tax cuts did not do anything useful, and tariff-related US exports have fallen..

Doubtless, Americans are going into personal debt to sustain their purchasing as econ stays uncoupled
5661 2018-12-06 15:56:21 You don't even consider the real cost of petroleum products because you're subsidized by oil and gas subsidies paid for by consumers.

Can’t find them?

That’s because they’re out driving around in a white pickup, smoking a cigarette, talking into a bluetooth headset, and looking for your farm...
5672 2018-12-06 15:55:47 People normally use olive oil as finishing dressing on food or just eaten raw (like a supplement?). Lagipun olive oil is so damn expensive :') either it's the normal olive oil or extra virgin, still expensive :')
5673 2018-12-06 15:55:42 Alternate how? Castor oil for your edges and the wild growth in your hair ??

5690 2018-12-06 15:54:30 @BetoORourke Sir I think you would be a fine President. My candidate needs to look 50 years ahead when the oil runs out and our population will likely be 4 billion people more than scientists have been saying for decades the Earth can sustain. America has to lead on this.
5691 2018-12-06 15:54:26 Destroying sea life for oil?  Sounds like a bright idea 
5692 2018-12-06 15:54:23 It's exactly the same reason he's saying he doesn't believe in climate change, he knows climate change is real, he knows it's man made; but there is a LOT of money to be made right now with oil/gas/coal, that the people of future will have to pay for :/
5693 2018-12-06 15:54:18 And palm oil

5696 2018-12-06 15:54:07 my guess is it's just oil
5697 2018-12-06 15:54:06 Heard that one of my classmates (idk who) intended to do fyp about deep frying using olive oil. We were all suprised. And khabarnya kena hentam teruk dengan panel. The nature of olive oil, you really cannot do deep frying with it. Stir fry pun macam tak convincing.

5706 2018-12-06 15:53:17 Let us not fool ourselves as to how #Petrojam has accumulated a loss of 600,682 barrels of oil valued at JMD 5.2B over 5yrs! The majority of that loss is from theft where ppl within authority caused petrol to be taken from the refinery to service stations owned/controlled by them
5707 2018-12-06 15:53:10 There you go, look on the bright side if you can't feel the warmth and power when you stand in the sunshine.  Soak it up my friend, maybe wear some sunscreen.  If big oil gets subsidies why shouldn't we little individuals.
5708 2018-12-06 15:53:07 I want to say again how very much I am against Mr Blaine Higgs ideas about improving our economy by promoting oil &gas..
5709 2018-12-06 15:53:04 Use the wild growth and castor oil together ??

I've never driven a Lincoln, but I read they are polluters that use too much oil too.....

5716 2018-12-06 15:52:38 It’s not just Muslims although recently, that seems to be the case. It’s anywhere in the world where the sitting majority decides to punish or even wipe out the minority. Unless there is oil, gold, diamonds or some other exploitable good - why get involved?
5717 2018-12-06 15:52:38 If you have anxiety and can’t smoke why haven’t you gotten on CBD oil yet
5718 2018-12-06 15:52:16 So helping the Saudi's cover up the murder of Jamal didn't lower the oil prices?
5719 2018-12-06 15:52:16 And Toronto Star is constantly bashing Alberta & the oil sands.  So glad my tax dollars are used this way.

5723 2018-12-06 15:51:50 There aren't 'two sides' to scientific evidence on climate change. There is evidence - proven, verified and accurate and the lies people who make money out of coal and oil tell. Do fuck off with this phoney balance shite.

5758 2018-12-06 15:48:54 @seriousfunnyguy 
1. Oil prices r down due to excessive supply

Trump imposed sanctions on Iran in May saying their exports should be cut to zero as of Nov.

This led oil to shoot up.

Trump told Opec and Russia to raise production to make up for deficit of Iran oil.
5759 2018-12-06 15:48:42 Both Omega 3 and 6 are "essential" fats. The problem is their proportion in the American diet with 20% of kcal coming from soybean oil, a highly refined oil ubiquitous in fast foods. Omega 6's are needed for the construction of hormones, but in a much closer ratio to Omega 3's.

You are delusional!
5765 2018-12-06 15:47:47 Which rebels would those be? The FSA fought against Da'esh, which took over Raqqa by defeating Ahrar al-Sham.
Assad financed the rise of Da'esh through oil and gas deals, and also assisted by mass-releasing hardcore jihadists from prison in 2011.

If you lot had built this bypass when the oil flowed we would have had the benefit of it for years by now. Instead you spent it, underinvested in infrastructure and ran up huge national debt

5789 2018-12-06 15:45:59 I mean, sure it is, in that it’s a definable *something* that exists and that we all require, but it’s not a material resource the way oil or something is.

5805 2018-12-06 15:44:32 I've got torn meniscus, I have found daily bike riding has helped strengthen the muscles around, and helps keep the knee joint in the right grooves.  Collagen is helpful.  as is reducing inflammation, CBD oil/cream is great for that.
5806 2018-12-06 15:44:32 Nope. I don't believe an immediate shift from oil is mandatory. I believe a medium-paced (not slow) gradual shift will do quite nicely. It is not the analysis of climate change that is wrong, it's the politically, rather than scientifically, driven projections that are wrong.
5807 2018-12-06 15:44:32 You’re an old stodgy Kentuckian who refuses to look at the big picture! Coal is dead! Wind, sun are cheap! Stop lining your pockets with oil/ coal Corp money open those squinty eyes & wake up...then again we know you don’t want too! Time to go!
5808 2018-12-06 15:44:31 Some Nigerians still believe Nigeria is rich because we have oil and natural resources but no refineries or major industries in 2018!!! countries with little or no major resources are developing faster and better than us. lol the country has become an embodiment of poverty
5809 2018-12-06 15:44:30 Some cocoanut oil with a few drops of peppermint oil, that will rock your world until you get too raw.
5810 2018-12-06 15:44:28 Could it be because the UN is controlled by these dictators since the oil crisis of the 70's and they are pulling the strings on the free world to align with their anti-isreal agenda?

5815 2018-12-06 15:44:03 There are not 2 sides to the science. The preponderance of evidence points to the reality of climate change .  The other 1% are either fools or , as in this case,in the pocket of the oil and gas industry.  Enough with this irresponsible misinformation.

5819 2018-12-06 15:43:53 The sad part about today, IMO we are counting on OPEC to come up with a plan to boost oil prices. I think that is the only thing that is going to push $SPY higher.

5831 2018-12-06 15:43:10 What does this have to do with the Jones Act?  How about comparing the number of oil pollution accidents of American ships versus non-American?  

The issue of Exxon Valdez had nothing to do with the Jones Act.
5832 2018-12-06 15:43:10 Actually in recent decades, higher oil prices means more profitable world economy.

5853 2018-12-06 15:41:26 Wow, yes, the math is complete no brainer in Europe.  I hadn't though of it compared to how I analyzed my own cost savings (7 cents per mile saved, on gas cost alone, from $0.10 to $0.03 - and that doesn't include maintenance savings, nor oil!, just gasoline!)
5854 2018-12-06 15:41:25 Sold my $UNG puts (rinse & repeat).  Loaded oil ($USO calls & $UWT) and shorted $VXX.

What harms the billions of profits for Oil?  Changing the economy to get of them!!  And who invests billions into Oil?  Finance!!!
5857 2018-12-06 15:41:15 Ouch! Very sorry to hear that sister.

Have you thought of buying CBD online?

I have seen CBD oil sold on Amazon, Google shopping, and eBay.

Have seen senators and Congress members saying they expect the regulations on cannabis relaxed after mid term.
5858 2018-12-06 15:41:13 We’ve been conned for a very long time and if you don’t like it then it is too late. Carbon tax and the death of millions are already secured through carbon taxes. Why don’t you research my claims about the eugenics movement and big oil being behind this scam?
5859 2018-12-06 15:41:13 This is so me
5860 2018-12-06 15:41:08 We have oil.The USA has oil.
5861 2018-12-06 15:41:02 According to climate scientists, global warming and climate change requires that we dial back oil & gas development/fossil fuel use as primary sources of energy. Of course, OG companies do not want to do this and instead are EXPANDING their development onto our public lands.
5862 2018-12-06 15:41:00 Zero support of the Oil Industry and a Carbon Tax for All = drives business away. Trudeau's "sunny-ways" is shutting down our Country !
5863 2018-12-06 15:40:56 Volcanoes are the best thing that could happen to combat “global warming”. In fact if we had period of elevated volcanic activity it could cause enough global cooling that you’d wish we had more dirty coal and oil to burn.

5869 2018-12-06 15:40:36 With a revenue to debt ratio climbing to 70%, uncertainty of oil in the global market place, huge infrastructural deficit, ever increasing recurrent expenditure and a weak civil service to drive govt policies, the future looks bleak. Is there redemption for our Nation? How?
5870 2018-12-06 15:40:35 but.. but.. but.. what if they cut oil production?

5878 2018-12-06 15:39:52 Higher prices in theory should prop up domestic industries with high exposure to the oil markets, so it's not entirely doom-and-gloom. Overall economic impact needs to be measured, though. Always trade-offs.

5885 2018-12-06 15:39:34 Oh idk, destabilizing the Middle East with his hunger for oil is one reason. Starting a war that has caused the highest death toll in history also. Idk how complicit with atrocities you are, so I doubt you care.

5891 2018-12-06 15:39:02 Oil prices fell sharply this morning after Saudi Arabia’s energy minister said that major producers hadn’t yet reached an agreement to cut production.  The comments came before the cartel convened a meeting aimed at hammering out an agreement.

5897 2018-12-06 15:38:19 That's a non-sequitur. It's taxing transportation. And outside of cities (where there are pollution issues) there is no reason to reduce oil based transportation. Inside cities, you can subsidize transportation that doesn't emit harmful particulates to promote clean air.

5901 2018-12-06 15:37:39 All of your “accomplishments” are coming home to roost. Your ridiculous trade war with China is adding to the collapse of the stock market; your lack of foreign policy has lead to increased Russian aggression; and your support of MBS is about to lead to higher oil prices. FRAUD.

5908 2018-12-06 15:37:10 Most of the oil that you sell domestically comes from domestic sources? 
Talk to me when you're producing most of the domestic products, and are set up to export high test.
A company that makes bank off exporting unfinished work has a lot of nerve telling us "#buylocal".
5909 2018-12-06 15:37:10 Where does it say they want to burn it? Extraction and use as fuel are two different things. You do realise that crude oil is used in the production of medicines?I know plastics are a problem but biodegradable is the way to go.
5910 2018-12-06 15:37:10 indecisive culture is thinking of buying micellar water but buys baby oil instead because cheapskate season is approaching

5912 2018-12-06 15:37:00 Keep screwing your base. Autoworkers, farmers, oil producers and field service companies. Job cuts across the board. Great vision!
5913 2018-12-06 15:37:00 The russians dont even have the capacity to extract and market all their own shit let alone wasting $$$ trying to do the same with Venezuela's shit tier oil.

5915 2018-12-06 15:36:44 When has an oil spill *Ever* been the fault of anyone/anything but the oil company?  That they think they can get away with the deflection (and propbably will to some degree) pisses me off almost as much as the spill.

5919 2018-12-06 15:36:26 At a time when preserving wildlife habit, watersheds, and natural areas is critical to mitigation of climate change, Trump and his 'I don't believe it" attitude is advancing oil and gas interests - the OPPOSITE of what he should be doing.

5921 2018-12-06 15:36:21 Yes, they’re a means to an end. I can’t think of a president that hasn’t been willing to overlook Saudi’s humanitarian violations.
5922 2018-12-06 15:36:10 These companies are going to ruin our air, water and land. With oil prices being so low, fracking doesn’t even make sense! We need to completely change our dependence on fossil fuels. Plus, who knows what’s in the fracking chemicals? We all need to wake up.
5923 2018-12-06 15:36:04 Lol what does it matter how many? Is there a magical number that will negate what i said and make our oil supply infinite?

We only have so much. We don't know how much. But it is not infinite.

5926 2018-12-06 15:35:38 They had to pull the trigger at some point, after years of 0 rates, to get the ball rolling.  Back then Oil could've been free, and they'd still have hiked

5934 2018-12-06 15:35:21 Well maintained cars are safer cars, so it’s important to make sure you change your oil on a regular basis. Regular inspections are also important to make sure that all the parts of your car (engine to tires) are working properly.
5935 2018-12-06 15:35:07 Texas needs higher oil prices that's how we Republicans down make a living!!!!!!

5938 2018-12-06 15:34:45 To expand on this, we barred at&t from working with huawei on 5g right after the repatriation (which also helps american company qualcom, who just launched 5g 2 days ago). We go to war for oil, we're definitely going to do the same for our tech co's that are as big as oil.

5943 2018-12-06 15:34:26 That's really good.. india was always a guzzler of oil... Earlier it was close door acknowledgment ...
5944 2018-12-06 15:34:21 Audi Arabia is down to 20% oil production profits of which are siphened back to the USA while the shipping companies pay next to No tax... SAUDI's got it wrong 50 years ago, just as you were warned 1500 years ago! See you in Hell...

5947 2018-12-06 15:34:03 Oil market movements seem infected by wider concerns now. Felt different two weeks ago. Rate of change is issue. Becomes self-fulfilling. Reflexivity at work? Take me: do I wanna catch a bit of anything here? Answer = no

5952 2018-12-06 15:33:44 @realDonaldTrump Oil production stagnated and this is a great victory for us and you. Everything is for a full boycott of Iran's oil, and it's up to zero to reach Iranian oil exports by April. Zero, zero, zero

5960 2018-12-06 15:33:24 Poloz says the BoC needs more time to understand what is going on with oil; declines to comment on question about whether an interest-rate cut is possible.
5961 2018-12-06 15:33:12 Fake friends, false lovers, politicians and snake oil salesmen all use words. Actions set you apart, not more words. Less talk, more act. Prove you are worthy of your promises.

5963 2018-12-06 15:33:04 @ericnuttall how have your forecasts for US oil production growth lined up to reality throughout this year? What do you expect in their growth going forward?
5964 2018-12-06 15:33:00 Beyond the fact that curtailing is likely a temporary move to raise oil prices, they're also buying more rail cars to increase carrying capacity (for an upcoming prod increase). All of which is tangential to fact that AB curtailing (excess) prod doesn't impact consmptn elsewhere.
5965 2018-12-06 15:33:00 My MLP thesis here:

1) Most are 50% or more nat gas $cnxm $omp $wes $hesm

2) oil volumes aren’t dropping for awhile if at all.  A 5% drop meaningless to $et $epd

3) New projects are completely additive.

5966 2018-12-06 15:32:37 Yup. Oil sands will be shut down under Trudeau who will own the media and it will be a crime to criticize immigration policy and m103 will be enacted.

5967 2018-12-06 15:32:36 That reminds me of a project I did for a company in the Oil & Gas space. They were pissed that dabs gear was outranking them for "oil rigs" and essentially wanted me to make their database more popular than pot. 

I did my best.

5969 2018-12-06 15:32:26 Will this be a replay of 2008-09? When oil demand due to the crisis slowed down a lot, it took a while for oil prices to come down.
5970 2018-12-06 15:32:25 @asda 

Hi Asda 

When are you going to stop using palm oil in your products?
5971 2018-12-06 15:32:16 I thought USA is highest producer of oil now and doesn't that mean we set the price , especially in our country.

5973 2018-12-06 15:32:11 The products of "crude oil" are well beyond petrol, diesel, kerosene which release CO. 

Other products include cooking gas, which release CO2 and numerous other petrochemicals that are ecologically safe. These products are just as important to every country.

5981 2018-12-06 15:31:42 then why was Cuba absolutely dependent upon oil and monocultural crops prior to the Soviet Union's dissolvement? This isn't a critique of the advancements of Cuban people and Im no fan of the embargo but the article makes it seem it has to do with that system when it happenstance
5982 2018-12-06 15:31:36 Trump named an oil tycoon Sec of State, and install his son in law a real estate tycoon, as shadow Sec of State... now ppl want to question if foreign policy is being sold out

5986 2018-12-06 15:31:19 You had typos of your own. We probably agree Twitter needs an edit button.

5987 2018-12-06 15:31:15 I’ll join the group. Lush does not deserve the attention it would garnish from a protest in front of its stores. It would encourage anti oil to support their other stores.

6001 2018-12-06 15:30:24 Gas prices are $193 here at way in Texas. You know the oil workers are hurting right now. Last time this happened they laid off 50k oil workers in Texas.

6009 2018-12-06 15:29:44 They are installing expensive LNG powered dual fuelled engines on these vessels but have no infrastructure for transportation of LNG to their terminals. In order for them to comply with the 2020 global 0.5% sulphur cap they will run on gas oil.
6010 2018-12-06 15:29:36 There are not two sides.  When 97% of scientists agree and the other 3% have their funding from oil, rely on theories recanted by the author, you only have 1 side to a story.
6011 2018-12-06 15:29:34 You're so naive.The oil will be extracted no matter who's in charge. The whole of Scotland could live off renewables but until the rest of the world does, it won't change. Power plants are the biggest producer of CO2. We need to invest in carbon capture, plant more trees
6012 2018-12-06 15:29:32 Olive Oil jg banyak di Indonesia. Cm memang agak mahal dan kualitasnya yg gak murni Olive Oil. Sekelas Bertolli kl di Indonesia. Sedangkan di Italia Bertolli itu xm 1€ aka bukan Olive Oil asli. Gak laku dan gak ada yg beli. Yg beli anak2 kos dari luar Italy
6013 2018-12-06 15:29:32 A pea-sized amount of baby oil can act as a shine hair serum before dashing out the door.
6014 2018-12-06 15:29:30 A jerry can of water or equivalent in radiator and 4 jugs of oil are needed. Its not just tires and battery spark plug and radiator. You need oil, water, and gas also before it will drive. Like real life

6016 2018-12-06 15:29:25 imo, it is uneconomic to replace humans with robots at the high-end and the low-end of work.  So, for example, better to be a 6-figure janitor/dogsbody on an oil rig, than a $50k pen-pusher in a suburb.  But don't stop writing your profitable newsletters/novels because of robots.

6032 2018-12-06 15:28:08 All this nonsense got me thinking
(And I’m not a conspiracy-theory type):

Would it be possible that @realDonaldTrump, @lopezobrador_, Orban, Putin are being sponsored and put in power by “big oil”?

Now for oil,  I don't think Alberta oil has a promising future. Over supply will eventually drop global prices.

There is talk that OPEC will NOT cut oil production enough to lift the price of oil.
OPEC discipline is gone.
Instead oil could fall to $45 – $43/ bbl.
The major oil companies will be down badly.

6063 2018-12-06 15:26:11 Logically you must be in favour of all the auto plants in Southern Ontario closing. Once they do, demand for oil will drop. Good thing the Star will be first in line for their federal $, unemployed auto workers can't afford to subscribe.

6073 2018-12-06 15:25:42 All this because of an oil tax?... calm down girl.

6075 2018-12-06 15:25:38 Just observing, Dec is usually a strong month “Santa Rally”, US economy is super strong, Europe is sucking socialist wind with an awful economy. China is in flux with the tariff situation, Transports are loving oil prices, but big oil not so much. 2 +s, 2 -s, & Santa.
6076 2018-12-06 15:25:33 Don't we want higher oil prices? We're soon to sell more than we buy.

6078 2018-12-06 15:25:27 #OPEC meets this week. Expect agreement to cut production to try to support #oil prices. What they say will be different than what they will do. These countries will cheat on quotas because they need the money, especially as a global recession unfolds.
6079 2018-12-06 15:25:21 If a mom with three kids can walk from Honduras to Tijuana for a chance at a minimum wage job in America, then I would think a healthy young man can move from Alabama to North Dakota for a $100,000/year job in the oil fields.
6080 2018-12-06 15:25:16 My damn oil change was $45
6081 2018-12-06 15:25:05 I'm in Florida and we have high insurance due to hurricanes.  We have high electric costs due to AC, but I remember having to scrape together $ to fill up the heating oil in New England.  Daunting now I imagine.
6082 2018-12-06 15:24:57 I want them both as well as Bushes and Mr Clinton. Bolton Haspel etc etc

6083 2018-12-06 15:24:45 You come to Jiffy Lube for an oil change, they gone tell you your engine gotta be rebuilt.
6084 2018-12-06 15:24:39 Ouch... mahal ba. Huhu. Pero essential oil is life ka eh. Haha
6085 2018-12-06 15:24:36 Trump if not punishing Saudi Arabia for horrifically killing an American Journalist to keep oil prices low as you are implying Trump your values are in the Toilet. Saudi Arabia you paid for 500 rooms in Trump’s Hotel in DC, conflict maybe, Trump self enrichment. SA sanctions Yes.
6086 2018-12-06 15:24:34 All construction and oil workers are potential threats to women...absolute disgraceful comments from our PM.
6087 2018-12-06 15:24:30 Good idea, but is it what we are suppose to be focusing on presently? Not leaving out d oil that is still being found in kastina and sokoto,wasting Nigeria's resources on failed projects.

6099 2018-12-06 15:23:37 We don’t need oil at all! Plenty of alternatives out there that don’t kill the planet! But money is more important to your type of greedy destroying terrorist.That’s why you ended up with the 3 stooges for your kids and an escort wife. You are an unhappy empty soul full of hate.
6100 2018-12-06 15:23:31 Why wait till we run out. We should take the lead in renewables. They will be costly up front but the long term benefits are substantial. Better to get off oil before it becomes prohibitively expensive
6101 2018-12-06 15:23:26 Saudi Arabia has not reformed enough in the first place to get foreign investments or attract skilled immigrants for their development.

If oil ever ends in Saudi Arabia, their only probably source of Income post oil era would be charging tax on Hajj visits from tourists

6113 2018-12-06 15:22:45 That’s above my pay grade. Either way it comes down to controlling what you can control. Nearly every scientist thinks man kind is worsening the situation & we’re running out of time to change it.I tend to side with scientist w/zero financial stake compared to oil/coal executives
6114 2018-12-06 15:22:42 Why is it that the United States is at the mercy of OPEC ????? Well it's more so the speculators that determine price ...... Oil is an item that I personally can't say "screw them I won't use anymore" these speculators must not have to commute to work daily . They aren't human .
6115 2018-12-06 15:22:39 We're already pumping enough without OPEC.... We need more "green" power instead of an oil slick.  Oh wait.... you don't get money out of alternative power though do you?

6119 2018-12-06 15:22:25 Absolutely, agree totally. Though, on the oil, there is a very good documentary called 'Red Oil' on how they wanted to use it for anti-poverty programs. Lexit populists in the UK have no problem using a 'strong leader' model. Have learnt nothing.

6121 2018-12-06 15:21:51 I repeat, they’re curtailing production entirely. So there is oil that would have been transported by pipeline that is staying in the ground.

6137 2018-12-06 15:20:52 The only question which remains: are whales or fossil oil sources more or less renewable?  Which one should we be using?
6138 2018-12-06 15:20:50 Yes, if, following the example of Asian countries, the U.S. subsidized the industry enough it might someday have enough oil & gas transport capacity. Questions are how much such subsidies cost taxpayers & how much consumers are hurt in the meantime.

6168 2018-12-06 15:19:14 You could look at the monthly reports from either IEA or IEA. They project demand growth levels for the coming year.

Some of the agencies have been talking about a plateau in the 2020s, but I don’t know of anyone who is surprised that oil demand has been rising in the present.

6171 2018-12-06 15:19:09 WTI oil at $51.19/barrel, -$1.69.
6172 2018-12-06 15:19:03 The immediate shift from oil is mandatory if you concede that the Earth is under no obligation to keep us alive.  And, of course, it isn't.  Some life will go on, but we don't have to be there.  Natural events pushed carbon way back.  We are the singular driver today.

6207 2018-12-06 15:16:22 Jim why does not your President understand he is bankrupting his oil producers with his stupid tweets for lower oil. Send him back to Wharton. He probably bought his undergrad diploma
6208 2018-12-06 15:16:21 That became a trend recently..."bullet-proof coffee"...either butter or coconut oil whipped into the coffee. Something about the fat molecules hold the caffeine longer?
6209 2018-12-06 15:16:19 THIS CAR STINKS LIKE OIL. BETTER TRY TO FIX IT WITH MY FARTS AND ASS STANK. *moans involentarily*
6210 2018-12-06 15:16:18 does ur car explode if ur oil level gets to 0% asking for a friend

Its better to go for an established midfield starter (27-28 year old) if Rakitic gets sold rather than invest in young talents(except the already established ones)

6214 2018-12-06 15:15:48 It's been blood for oil from the advent of its use. Before that it was blood for whale oil
Check that out in Massachusetts history books.

6217 2018-12-06 15:15:33 Oil futures sharply lower, with growing concerns that OPEC will not make an aggressive output cut
6218 2018-12-06 15:15:26 Para que usaron la reforma energética? Ayer lo demostró Salinas y su petrolera Sierra Oil. Para ESPECULAR. Esta petrolera de Salinas NUNCA sacó un barril de crudo pero tenía un contrato enorme. Al final vendieron la empresa a una petrolera alemana y ganaron MILES DE MILLONES
6219 2018-12-06 15:15:24 Burn an essential oil or incense that is good for grounding. Wear the color red more, this is root chakra color which is an effortless aid in helping you get grounded. I just did a lot of root work recently and I have 2 jobs now. It’s a lot of discipline.
6220 2018-12-06 15:15:18 Canada, with a world class energy industry and among the highest oil reserves, imports oil from Saudi Arabia. Think about that.

6223 2018-12-06 15:14:52 At this point, it should be called the COGPA, the Coal, Oil & Gas Protection Agency
6224 2018-12-06 15:14:51 In the 70’s Scottish independence would conceivably put us on a par with Norway - but it didn’t happen. Now around 70% of the oil is gone and new finds are not holding the stocks up.
Oil contributes under 2% of all Scottish revenues even using a geographic share.
6225 2018-12-06 15:14:42 How come it is possible when the hydroelectric capacity would drastically reduce in winter and the the nuclear and solar installed capacities are very low. Certainly the high cost gas and oil power generation maybe the available option for export. Can u plz inform the return
6226 2018-12-06 15:14:40 Extracting the oil so that it can be combusted is exactly the wrong thing to do. It accelerates the damaging effects of climate change. It must be stopped. Pay attention to the world outside your bank balance.

6234 2018-12-06 15:14:21 If the US is the top oil producer, why do we give a damn about Saudi Arabia and OPEC oil?  Keep US oil in the US and stop buying anyone else’s oil! #EnergyIndependence
6235 2018-12-06 15:14:15 Why would you hire a lightning rod when he’s not that great to boot???
6236 2018-12-06 15:14:15 My Essential Oil clearly says to put in a carrier oil, not directly on the skin. You should ALWAYS test it before slathering on.
6237 2018-12-06 15:14:14 Life on this planet needs higher oil prices.
6238 2018-12-06 15:14:01 "Protetor solar, oil free"
Uma das maiores mentiras já contadas atualmente.
6239 2018-12-06 15:13:47 Oil is dying and Third Reich in WW2 created synthetic gasoline through coal but western Alliance banned the practice through Germany's unconditional surrender but poisoned the world with Third Reich synthetic opium expired patent...
So the legend goes....
6240 2018-12-06 15:13:38 Not a problem. I've only really been sewing for 18 months. The most important thing is to oil the parts every 6 months or so, and the directions for that are right in the manual.

6243 2018-12-06 15:13:22 I'm being an adult. I'm up before 11am, getting my oil changed (it's been a while) and drinking damn near black coffee HOORAY MANHOOD!!!!
6244 2018-12-06 15:13:20 There are thousands of large cities in the world that can and do develop alternative energies, but there is only one city that is sitting on the largest recoverable oil reserves in the world. Why would we abandon that? That is like tearing up a winning lottery ticket. It's insane
6245 2018-12-06 15:13:14 Well if OPEC fails to show that they can stop oil from falling to say 35 next year, that would influence some inflation expectations surely, even if the Fed looks through energy prices..
6246 2018-12-06 15:13:13 I just heard from Vienna that the reason for #OPEC trying to cut production is that in anticipation of #Iran oil #sanction in November, extra oil had been pumped into the market. With ALL sorts of wavers for Iranian oil, the market is facing a glut now. So much for sanctions!!!

6248 2018-12-06 15:12:59 It’s a problem w/ many old cars in general. The engines burn through oil faster than they did new. I used to get an oil and filter change every 5k miles. Now, I fill up the oil at 3k then get the oild and filter change at the next 3k.

6251 2018-12-06 15:12:42 As Trudeau vision becomes clear to all, momentum to oust him will grow. He would shut down oil sands, open borders, enact m103, ridicule/mock parliament by non-answering, ignore ethics, censor the media to control thought, with his arrogant virtue signalling
6252 2018-12-06 15:12:41 Private deal with Saudi. You drop oil prices so I look good for approval ratings and I’ll look the other way while you kill off our fake news reporters
6253 2018-12-06 15:12:41 Thanks, Bernie. The Absolutists here don't see the absurdity. Compare these outlets giving equal time to Oil Industry Spokesparrots with Trump's "Maybe he did, maybe he didn't" Saudi defense even as he profits personally from their hotel room bookings. Unbridled capitalism.
6254 2018-12-06 15:12:38 Hahaaa... we  know the problems of Angolian oil too.. e.g not well refined (pollutants)

6266 2018-12-06 15:11:28 Let me guess. You have no car, home or job. Because if you do you rely on Alberta oil and gas every day as the rest of us do. We didn’t elect this clusterfuck but we’re stuck with because of uninformed warm and fuzzies like yourself
6267 2018-12-06 15:11:28 I was told it smelled and still wasn’t prepared. I think it’s an Indian oil.
6268 2018-12-06 15:11:25 Put as much importance on solving the challenges of climate change as we did on getting 2 the moon, American manufacturing would benefit. Gotta believe in climate change 4 that 2 happen, & not be bought by oil & coal. Don’t see 45 having that kind of foresight or thoughtfulness.
6269 2018-12-06 15:11:16 who told Ghanaian companies to buy rice and oil for their workers during Christmas??
6270 2018-12-06 15:11:03 Itni nafrat...
Any who, like always, you missed the main point. The point was not that they changed oil prices just coz of Modi... the point to note was the minister mentioning Modi even when there wasn’t no question on Modi.

6272 2018-12-06 15:10:57 Trudeau doesn't give a dam about Alberta oil. All he is concerned about is Quebec and central Canada votes.
6273 2018-12-06 15:10:57 As I responded before current oil prices are good for the US and bad for Iran, Russia and Venezuela. Therefore great!

6280 2018-12-06 15:10:31 Why are oil prices per barrel from $8 to $62 all produced in the U.S? Shouldn't we have a set price for all of our natural resource? We are the biggest producer in the world why not profit from that?
6281 2018-12-06 15:10:29 Those who argue the economy is too important to stop developing and  expanding fossil fuel infrastructure — from oil sands to pipelines to  deep sea drilling to fracking — ignore the mounting costs of climate  disruption and the economic benefits of shifting to cleaner energy.

6298 2018-12-06 15:09:09 Yes, that is why I put rural Canadians. Rural Canadians are doing the backbreaking work and get no help, while the cities get all the infrastructure and investment. They also got Alberta's oil equalization and net $20 Billion net Federal transfers according to CalgaryHerald.

6305 2018-12-06 15:08:25 This oil change place has dogs
6306 2018-12-06 15:08:23 OPEC cutting oil output will force gas stocks to artificially rise, pump prices will increase for the common man, and hedge funds will clean up. There's a world-wide glut of oil, and the peak oil theory has been refuted.

6310 2018-12-06 15:08:16 Diversifying is good. But the energy industry is actually prospering elsewhere and demand is growing in the world. But it’s tough to prosper here in Canada when our own governments landlock our energy supply and force our oil/gas to be sold at a 75% discount!
6311 2018-12-06 15:08:12 It doesn't make sense unless the long game is to kill the oil biz - which is precisely why #Notley put it place - why @jkenney agrees is beyond comprehension - but he is squishy on a range of #conservative issues these days.

6326 2018-12-06 15:07:01 I don't get why oil plunge did not lower gas prices there substantially, if crude can lose almost 40% of its value in a matter of months, France gas prices don't reflect that, than there is something wrong there...
6327 2018-12-06 15:06:59 Oil got sold on the black market
6328 2018-12-06 15:06:45 That was just ignorant. Oil seeped up from the ground and caught fire on its own from lightning or volcanic eruptions. Even if man hadn't figured out how to use it, it will still be burning on it's own..

6332 2018-12-06 15:06:25 Because Oil prices fell due to Fracking etc, no one is claiming they’ll reach pre 2014 prices, the McCrone reports shows what an iScot would have generated from oil from the 70s onward, GCR shows what is is 2017/18
6333 2018-12-06 15:06:21 Don't you know that we get less than 9% of oil from them ... we get the majority of our imported oil from Canada.
You just looking for a cheap Photo Op while sucking the oxygen out of the room. You're unfit for office.
6334 2018-12-06 15:06:08 I agree with you,the day we'll run out of oil anywhere in the world will probably come while we're still alive, but rn we mostly move thanks to it and the majority of us still own a gas-fueled car and can't afford to switch to electric.
E-Cars should cost a little less tbh.

6336 2018-12-06 15:05:57 Aren’t you the guys that kill the oil and gas industry chasing away almost 100 billion in investment? And now set your sight on killing the auto industry.  And called construction workers rapers and plunders. If that’s what you mean then good job carry on.
6337 2018-12-06 15:05:56 I only found out today myself it's vegan. Been given a hot tip that vegan womble website is a pretty definitive source of info and people update what can and can't be eaten. If you want proper vegan no palm oil gravy I'm reliably informed the Bisto in the jars, onion or veg are x

6340 2018-12-06 15:05:43 We've been in a recession. Public hasn't realized it yet. When they do the panic sets in. 

Credit and liquidity bubble popping. Has been since September. 

Just wait until oil hits $30 by early '19 and the market drops another 200 on S&P by EOY. That's when the public knows
6341 2018-12-06 15:05:38 Page 32 of the AGD report shows  that by 2015 the refinery brought the unaccounted for oil losses under control. But after change of govt politics took over and the man who turned it around was kicked out and politics came in. Result; Floyd Grindley an unmitigated disaster.
6342 2018-12-06 15:05:35 Trump fears political price from oil spike, market turmoil: THIS STUPID "KOCH"-SUK'N LYIN' BAS'TURD' ! HE KNOWS DAMN WELL IT IS "HIM, AND HIM ALONE" THAT IS UNWELCOME ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, NOT EVEN TO FUNERALS, EXCEPT HIS OWN !!!

6345 2018-12-06 15:05:26 something is seriously wrong with the Oil Services industry, beyond the recent weakness in commodity prices. $OIH $XES

6348 2018-12-06 15:05:14 $spx $spy $qqq trade, oil, brexit, jobs.  Lots of noise. I predict today will be the December low. OPEC and jobs resolve tomorrow and Huawei issue may too. Brexit is mess but not that big a risk to US stocks.  Fed risk abates.
6349 2018-12-06 15:05:11 "We have run out of oil before." Oh, I must have missed it!!! "There have been gas shortages." Have you considered this could have been a manufactured crisis, fear porn, to raise prices, transfer power, and rape the taxpayer... all staged to manipulate sheeple?
6350 2018-12-06 15:05:10 But you literally opened the flood gates with fracked oil and said FU OPEC
6351 2018-12-06 15:05:09 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
6352 2018-12-06 15:05:06 The U.S. is the largest oil producer thanks to Obama pushing energy independence from the foreign sources.  Qatar leaving OPEC should not affect our gas prices.  If it does, its likely because you screwed it up like you have done with our farmers, auto, train and housing industry
6353 2018-12-06 15:04:57 No we took out our own CIA asset because he sought to trade oil for gold instead of the dollar same as Gaddafi  GOD gold,Oil,Dope what all wars are about don't shit yourself believing anything else
6354 2018-12-06 15:04:55 You forget to mention the three years you failed to accomplish anything except for hiring anti oil crusaders as advisers. Hypocrisy at its best
6355 2018-12-06 15:04:45 On your four points; 
- Boston can import natural gas from LA, but there are no American ships to transport it.  What is needed is provisions to facilitate the construction of such vessels as governments in East Asia due to subsidies. 
- Same with Texas exporting crude oil.

6372 2018-12-06 15:03:12 Early steam power ran on wood, until they discovered that coal produced more work per ton than wood.  So given that, steam power would have consumed pretty much all the wood.  Without kerosene light would have been provided by whale oil (up until electric lights).

6375 2018-12-06 15:03:02 So in @RachelNotley AND @jkenney world, the way to "save" the oil industry is to mandate a 9% reduction in oil we're selling to the #US at a 60% discount to world price and replacing it with #US and #Saudi oil at world price - we're in the very best of hands

6401 2018-12-06 15:01:08 If the earth warms up, it is easier to get oil from the poles/arctica. So they want the earth to warm up to get even more oil. Thats insanity in it's purest form.

It would be the biggest crime in human history, if there was not the Holocaust which of course cant be top'ed.

6408 2018-12-06 15:00:40 They’re right to attack them. Leaving it in the ground with no proper plan to replace the income and jobs lost is not a wise approach. By all means plan for a future without oil, but for the short and medium term at least, oil expoitation is essential for the economy.
6409 2018-12-06 15:00:38 Yup... getting ready for a break.  But for Trump, oil would be higher.  Have to think frackers are getting nervous right now.

6413 2018-12-06 15:00:35 I believe oil- and Trump's tariff talk had more to do with the recent slide. Many people think cheap oil is good for our Economy- this is not true. USA/Canada need $50 a barrel to produce profitably- too far below that- the market will slide. Its just too much investment.

6419 2018-12-06 15:00:17 The maintenance required light is notifying you that maintenance is required according to the driven distance on the vehicle's maintenance schedule.  Most often this just means your vehicle might be due for an oil change.

6442 2018-12-06 14:58:00 As a medical cannabis patient and a father, I’m a firm supporter of CBD oil for treating certain conditions in children. There is plenty of evidence that shows CBD can be extremely effective in treating a multitude of diseases in children and adults. Still, be cautious.
6443 2018-12-06 14:57:58 By the way, I’ve driven it nearly 200k miles. The hybrid system still gets 37-42mpg after all that wear-and-tear on the NiMH battery. (It got about 45-50mpg when new.) Aside from having to refill oil every 3k miles, I have very few issues w/ the car after 13 years.
6444 2018-12-06 14:57:56 What about Iraq? We really went there because Saudi Arabia was scared that Saddham would march right down the coast and take their kingdom (and all of Bush's oil investments)  28 years later, we are still there.
6445 2018-12-06 14:57:44 This may sound patronising but the past is always relevant as ignoring it means we keep up ending in the shit e.g the oil industry should have been nationalised and we could have done an orderly changeover to renewables. No need to consider shareholders no need for fracking.
6446 2018-12-06 14:57:33 Hey Chyyy, are you still out? Get some pure aloe Vera gel or pure castor oil to relieve the pain and impact of the burn. If you are home, raw potato peel works incredibly fast and well over the burn. Take care, honey. Wishing you a better day ahead. 
6447 2018-12-06 14:57:30 I guess we can agree to disagree then? I am not in favor of zero perks but I felt it was/is overkill. For me every team if they have success should have to build it over time. The Oil have just been inept at achieving that.

I was in Indonesia for a month this year and witnessed tens of thousands of ethnic Indonesians destroying millions of acres of rainforest to harvest palm oil so they can earn a living.

Elephants, tigers, monkeys, birds, tons of species at risk.

Highly racist/right-wing.

6483 2018-12-06 14:55:28 Veggies of your choice, garlic chopped however you like, onion powder, salt, Italian seasoning. For protein you can add tofu. Add chilis if you like some spice. Honestly a shoe will taste good if you roast it in olive oil garlic and chilis.

One succeeds,the other fails,love had nothing to do with it.
The complexity you describe I get-the snake oil that is sold to districts-reprehensible.
There lies the problem.
You are referring to curriculum versus instruction.

6494 2018-12-06 14:54:46 OPEC to cut oil production.... 

Hmmmn
6495 2018-12-06 14:54:41 If I am right that's how US imports all the oil it needs, by printing dollars, and US has pretty low inflation.
6496 2018-12-06 14:54:40 J$5Billion worth of crude oil would have a much higher value after being refined for gasoline etc. The true loss is greater than we may think.

6514 2018-12-06 14:53:18 Electric uses oil. Plant based fuel uses oil and water. Nuclear autombiles? Many people have nuclear heart implants. Solar cars? Not in Alaska or Oregan. Get your engineering, science degree and make a difference.

6517 2018-12-06 14:53:10 The Saudi oil  minister mentions how @narendramodi Ji urged OPEC to rein in oil prices & reduce it so that it helps consumers bk in India because of which fuel prices came down in India

Hint: see oil/gas/mining/petrochemical industries.
6521 2018-12-06 14:52:54 Fuck water! We need oil! 
6522 2018-12-06 14:52:51 OPEC will cut oil production. By how much?
6523 2018-12-06 14:52:46 Was oil used in the device you are typing on? If you feel so deeply about this, rid yourself of everything oil dependent.
6524 2018-12-06 14:52:45 @foxs_biscuits why do so many of your products have palm oil in?

Chop a jalapeño and crush or chop one hunk of a garlic clove.  Heat about 1 tbsp of oil in a small pan and toast garlic and jalapeño-1/2
6529 2018-12-06 14:52:28 If 100 people are equally benefiting from this missing oil, they've each been pocketing $10 million a year for the past 5 years. If it's 50 people, $20 million a year. Baxide

Do you know how much the foreign reserve has grown in the last 3 years despite having to cope with the low selling price of crude oil?

6540 2018-12-06 14:51:44 I wish you would instead champion a motion to diversity our economy away from the oil industry. Championing the recovery of an industry that will only crash and burn once again in a few years is irresponsible and short sighted.
6541 2018-12-06 14:51:43 If I break your heart na oil spillage
6542 2018-12-06 14:51:37 I mean it also historically was fruit and wood and shipping routes and even oil a bit, but now it’s just a place for us to sell more weapons. We benefit from them staying miserable, so.

エキストラバージンオリーブオイルとはオリーブの果実を搾ってろ過しただけのバージンオイルです。
6548 2018-12-06 14:51:17 You dilute it with a carrier oil, such as almond oil, avocado oil, sunflower, argan....the essential oil is flat out too strong for your skin
6549 2018-12-06 14:51:16 Tariffs on oil imported from overseas to eastern Canada. Kill C-69. Hire competent advisors. Appoint an energy minister with experience. Kill the carbon tax. Loft the west coast tanker ban. Approve northern gateway. Move the NEB to Alberta........
6550 2018-12-06 14:51:06 Haha you think big oil has power. They are just trying to survive against the Mom and pops of the shale revolution and fear the oligarchs in the Middle East pumping more. Survival mode isn’t a power play
6551 2018-12-06 14:50:58 @rocionahle @AlfredoJalifeR_ @lopezobrador_ @AristeguiOnline  interesante para el periodismo libre revisar cómo autorizó(CNH)que Jerónimo Gerard( cuñado de Salinas) participara en Sierra Oil and Gas, revender a BlackRock y este revendiera sacado ganancias sin producir 1 barril

6555 2018-12-06 14:50:28 A serious investment in USCG Arctic mission is important because we also need to establish a deep harbor port for our vessels, Sullivan notes. Without it, addressing oil spills/nat sec issues, really, anything, is exponentially harder.
6556 2018-12-06 14:50:27 The only reason half the people voted for you was the stock market and oil, if they both go down, I think you will lose a lot of support.
6557 2018-12-06 14:50:23 In 1973 my granddad was a janitor at a high school. He went to the art fair the students were having to show support. There was one oil painting made by a freshman that caught his attention and he decided to buy it.
6558 2018-12-06 14:50:22 Are biofuels really superior, or just another way for Koch Industries to be profitable?  I don't really care whether big oil stays in business or not. Any more than anyone cared about the whale oilers. Or Sears after the Internet and Amazon displaced them.
6559 2018-12-06 14:50:22 I'm at retirement age but the price of oil is breaking the bank, taking every last penny I make, raising the cost of everything from food to clothes and cars everything follows the oil. I'll never retire because of what the Libtards have done, we can only pray for an early death.

6564 2018-12-06 14:49:52 I have replaced olive oil with safflower. Much lighter tasting.
6565 2018-12-06 14:49:43 More than the oil I think natural gas is the culprit here 4.4 should be the high max will check.tomorrow if it breached that also
6566 2018-12-06 14:49:43 There's nothing "temporary" about the US military's presence in northern Syria where all the oil is. Why are anarchists so gullible?

6569 2018-12-06 14:49:29 You’re just saying that the PHD’s have no integrity and are willing to risk their livelihood for $80K a year when oil execs have demonstrated just that, i.e. unjustified price hikes and $15B profit quarters. In essence, you’re siding with cigarette companies on cancer research.
6570 2018-12-06 14:49:25 That can't be good.  An OPEC delegate is telling Bloomberg there may not be a production quota announcement today.  Look out below, falling oil prices!
6571 2018-12-06 14:49:22 I'd also add that Venezuela is a capitalist country that thought it could do socialism by half. This was the biggest mistake Chavez made. Instead of nationalizing ALL privately owned industry, he only really targeted the oil companies.

6577 2018-12-06 14:48:45 I think I would prefer all these activist to modify their message in pressuring oil companies to make quicker conversions to renewables. But removing them from the equation makes no sense.

Damn, the French are masters of voicing up dissent to the state's negligence. How I wish Filipinos will do the same and rise up against the government's inaction of certain issues that matter most.

6583 2018-12-06 14:48:22 Y’all dk how happy I am that I’m finally getting an oil change. The place has been booked for WEEKS 
6584 2018-12-06 14:48:20 Well the whole scenario is hypothetical. Neither of us even have a car. So let’s assume she asks me to go change the oil naked....
6585 2018-12-06 14:48:02 Disclaimer: As you can see from my profile I am just an opinionated bottle of olive oil, all words are my own 
6586 2018-12-06 14:48:01 I really hope they can do it.  Marine shipping is a fundamental component of global trade, and bunker oil contributes substantially to pollution.  A company like Maersk striving toward zero emissions should be lauded.

6590 2018-12-06 14:47:34 Agreed. It’s obvious to anyone with half a brain that they have planned the demise of the Oil industry.

6615 2018-12-06 14:45:51 World doesn't need oil full stop, pass laws making these companies divert some of the trillions they've made to renewable transport and energy. Would be the responsible thing for government and the least companies like OPEC could do. Have the companies retrain workers too.....

6627 2018-12-06 14:45:09 Iran's (subtle?) threats to disobey the OPEC+ format & partner w Qatar does seem uncharacteristically impulsive since Iran stands to lose more than gain by doing so, as this move is bound to decrease the price of oil that Russia & Saudi are working at keeping at a stable level.

6629 2018-12-06 14:45:03 Think the financial washout is the last stage for market correction. We washed out FANG++, high P/E & oil.  Now financials have to price a potential end to rising spreads.  Just like lower oil - lower rates are a good thing.  Banks don't need more $ - let it be invested elsewhere

6750 2018-12-06 14:36:19 At this moment I'd LOVE to see a breakdown of WHAT could've been done with that $5 BILLION dollars worth of missing oil. WITH $5 BILLION we could what? What is out there that tax payers need that $5 BILLION could have helped with? cld it have helped lower gas, pay some tings?
6751 2018-12-06 14:36:17 Why oil changes cost so much?
6752 2018-12-06 14:36:03 bitches will literally stab u twice with a pen and b like "i got an essential oil for that lol"
6753 2018-12-06 14:35:57 The price is low now because companies put a lot of oil on storage as a prevention for the renwed sanctions on Iran... then Trump blinked and issued waivers to many Iran customers.  The oversupply will end and oil will go again high.
6754 2018-12-06 14:35:52 Haha! Yeah because PHD scientists making $80K a year are risking their reputations and potential fines to falsify information. If true, wouldn’t they be saying more studies are required in order to “get funding”? Ridiculous. And sorry, the jets and yachts are for the oil execs.

6759 2018-12-06 14:35:34 Super easy!!! A pork loin/shoulder, jerk seasoning (I used McCormick, but whatever one u prefer) rub the seasoning on the pork, mix the dry seasoning with some olive oil and inject it in the pork, chop up an onion, smash some garlic, chop up a habanero, in the crock pot for 8hrs
6760 2018-12-06 14:35:33 Donal Trump since the US is actually a next EXPORTER of oil, lower oil prices actually hurt our Energy Companies and our export revenues!

6777 2018-12-06 14:34:06 Completely foolish. Canada has the highest environmental standards. Shutdown the Oil Sands , you export production to countries with lower standards. Countries run by despots and dictators.

6780 2018-12-06 14:34:02 Boleh uol beli olive oil tapi bukan guna utk goreng2. Buat dressing salad atau gaul2 spaghetti ok lah. 

Goreng ayam is a big no no lah. Moralnya, kalau nak benda berminyak yg penyediaannya tanpa haba, boleh pakai olibe oil.

Kalau pakai haba, gunalah minyak sawit.

6790 2018-12-06 14:33:26 Agreed.  We can start with removing the subsides for the oil and gas industry.
6791 2018-12-06 14:33:24 Yes! Let me know what you think. I came out thinking some issues not mentioned also deserve further exploration, like the connection between fracking and production, and how plastic and oil are value-dependant (low oil price=cheap new plastic=old plastic is trash, not resource).

6824 2018-12-06 14:31:19 The world shouldn’t need oil!

Maybe a wheat or oil embargo 
I know they could prevent any lumber from entering Canada...

I tried menthol, t-amylol, trpin, both Mg chips and fine powder, at T up to 240C. Could it be oil? Or NaOH? Maybe stirbar gets consumed by sodium?

6841 2018-12-06 14:29:33 With oil prices this low, and good demographics, you'd expect strong sales. Waning demand not a good look for economy.
6842 2018-12-06 14:29:26 Olive oil is often cut with seed oil. Better, but still...

I'll use olive oil at home where I control the sourcing.
6843 2018-12-06 14:29:18 Really?  Now, remind me, who owns the oil and whisky companies and where are they based?

6854 2018-12-06 14:28:12 The financial system has enormous power to drive sustainability through investment decisions (into low/zero-carbon infrastructure) and engagement with existing investees (pushing for *far* more ambitious climate policies from high emitters like oil & gas majors).

6857 2018-12-06 14:27:47 Understandable, decline in importance of ME oil will spell Western disinterest in the region which would be disastrous for Israel.
6858 2018-12-06 14:27:46 In Iraq, we allowed authorized representatives to bring the documents to the Embassy for certification. Surely, with the way you said your companies have been treating you, this should not be a problem at all for all of you working in oil facilities in the deserts of Libya.
6859 2018-12-06 14:27:45 yup.  i shut down the salad dressing a long time ago, now just get olive oil.  and try to avoid anything where i can't see all the ingredients, like stews or sauces etc.  but home cooking is best.  thanks for sharing your thoughts

6891 2018-12-06 14:25:07 So why has Trump continually screwed Russia on foreign policy? Oil production? Natural gas,  selling arms to Eastern Europe.... you're a joke
6892 2018-12-06 14:25:05 Winnipeg probably not i agree! I feel like Canada is 4 cities, plus lots of nice landscapes and relaxed town style living. So we have calgary (oil) vancouver (china) toronto (the rest of the economy with china buying real estate) and montreal (french)

6903 2018-12-06 14:24:22 Adding to #RRE at 625p. Value gap here is significant despite recent oil price volatility.
6904 2018-12-06 14:24:22 We cant afford our population growth rate.

We are an oil dependent country but we produce 2mbpd for 200m people while Saudi Arabia produce 10mbpd for 30m people.

We are surely heading for an economic crisis that may not be curtailed with our present population growth rate.
6905 2018-12-06 14:24:21 @HammerNation19 I told you, just have your wife put some castor oil in a smoothie. It doesn’t taste great, but my wife was late too and uncomfortable. She tried it and went into labor a couple hours later.

6909 2018-12-06 14:23:50 Dick, you begin by acknowledging the urgency ("12 years to get global emissions by 45%"), then discuss some promising, but nonetheless R&D-stage possibilities for hydrogen uses with CCS, and end with a call to keep the oil & gas industry going as long as possible.
6910 2018-12-06 14:23:40 the money for the greener alternative energy comes from ? And the subsidies that make it affordable to a country who has shot itself in the head by stopping oil production?
6911 2018-12-06 14:23:38 This may be premature, but so be it.  I think these guys (Mills, Perry, and Fizdale) could be snake oil salesmen. They value offense over defense & value volume scoring over efficiency.  We'd be better off with Phil and all his warts. He knew basketball.
6912 2018-12-06 14:23:33 Then stop voting for the dirty, vile , disgusting coal , oil & gas funded @GOP and the ghoul @realDonaldTrump .. Burning the very place you live on is the single most stupid thing a person could do . #FuckTrump #FuckTheGOP #FuckKochBros

Off to dab some coconut oil on my eyes...
6921 2018-12-06 14:23:12 And @NNPCgroup already said they have enough fuel in the own storage facilities. 
It's election time. They just want to raise subsidyissues.
6922 2018-12-06 14:23:00 The prices of oil flopped before he got in office, wich led to mass layoffs.

Hes been trying to push that one pipeline, even though environmentally pipelines have been a nightmare.

 Tough please everyone.
Where my empathy for him as a dad to young kids.
Thats a lot to balance.
6923 2018-12-06 14:22:55 Didn't we already run out of oil and freeze to death..or are you too young and lucked out by missing the end of life on earth?
6924 2018-12-06 14:22:44 I want it cheaper than that with decomissing costs and oil taking a pounding....
6925 2018-12-06 14:22:39 The Volt also saves on maintenance with practically no hose or belts to be replaced. ( ironically this its downfall to as dealerships can’t make money off of customers bc the maintenance is so low) Battery life also is not a issue. I would rather subsidize these cars than oil.

6928 2018-12-06 14:22:33 Hydrogen is the best way of storing energy since the 60's of the last century. 
Today you can buy a efficient hydrogen car. And to produce hydrogen is not more expensive then to fracture oil into Disel and gas. Renewable energy sources  have been proven to meet the demand

6930 2018-12-06 14:22:23 Among 98 oil-producing countries, #Iraq ranks 4th in oil production&9th in barrels per capita. By itself,the #Kurdistan Region ranks 29th in production and 13th in barrels per capita. Production continues to increase and public wealth from oil is zero but private wealth promising
6931 2018-12-06 14:22:19 We allow Multinationals to plunder these finite resources, as fast as technology allows, just to keep their profits up. Leave some for future generations. Nature took 300 million years to make oil. We burn most of it in a century

6944 2018-12-06 14:21:32 That is straight of the oil lobby's disinformation campaign on Rachel Carson.  Rachel Carson never advocated a global ban but highlighted the toxicity of DDT.

But Ed, if u think DDT is so safe & doesn't accumulate in the environment, why dont u go ahead & drink a glass everyday

6951 2018-12-06 14:20:56 I avoid articles that discuss impact of producing palm oil. I’m an ardent consumer so I just look the other way and it’s not different this time. I can’t imagine cutting it out
6952 2018-12-06 14:20:51 How to spell boondoggle? $70,000,000,000 to build the Wall, $150,000,000 a year to maintain the Wall. That's $70 Billion and $150 million per year respectively.saddle up America, you will be drilled for oil.
6953 2018-12-06 14:20:48 Yes, I don’t want to see higher oil prices.
6954 2018-12-06 14:20:48 Oil WTI crude could be headed to $45 today. Demand is down for oil, this is good; hopefully this will curtail any new drilling!

7015 2018-12-06 14:15:30 It is my sincere hope that the acute abuse of state owned resources like PetroJam and PetroTrin in Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago does not occur in Guyana given their recent entry into the oil industry. 
We have been underdeveloped by external forces and now we do it to self.

7031 2018-12-06 14:14:39 Why @realDonaldTrump do you want to drive energy service business out of business ?   The oil companies who are drilling will simply make UL their loss margins by hammering service companies
7032 2018-12-06 14:14:30 Hey Alicia! It sounds like you may want to try a Gel to help combat this porblem. May we suggest the Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Gel? Our customers tend to recommend this product a lot

7040 2018-12-06 14:13:46 Take that up with Neera Tanden. The 1st tweet was just donation data. Tanden attacked calling it “dangerous.” Nothing David Sirota tweeted was inaccurate. It led me to do research. I found out Beto voted with oil & gas interests on important legislation. These are all just facts.
7041 2018-12-06 14:13:41 Canada's exports were down 1.2% in Oct, principally on lower exports of crude oil. Imports were down 0.6%, mainly due to fewer imports of passenger cars/light trucks. As a result, Canada's trade deficit widened from $891 million in September to $1.2 billion in October.

7057 2018-12-06 14:12:32 I'm not Racist about anyone !!! Just think that Oil is a source of more trouble than we all need.
Let each country use there resources and if we choose to trade with others, well the trade should be equal. 
Food for Oil is and should be an equal trade for it's hard to eat sand.

7059 2018-12-06 14:12:00 OIL: Oil prices dipped as stock markets slid and as traders eyed an OPEC meeting expected to result in a supply cut aimed at draining a glut that has pulled down crude by 30 percent since October.

7065 2018-12-06 14:11:40 The next financial crisis will be a sovereign debt crisis. My prognosis is that depending on commodity and oil prices, it will arrive Africa early, most likely 2019, before the rest of the world goes into a slow arsenic zombification by 2020.

7072 2018-12-06 14:11:12 @jadeepooh the oil and salt coming
7073 2018-12-06 14:11:10 She's a social democrat, not a socialist ffs. You know the people that want tax dollars to actually go to the people not just line the pockets of oil barrons and arms dealers....
7074 2018-12-06 14:11:02 OPEC has made a planned cut in oil output effectively conditional on the contribution from non-OPEC producer Russia, delegates said on Thursday as the group gathered in Vienna for a meeting aimed at supporting battered oil prices.
7075 2018-12-06 14:10:57 There are two hidden shadows of #politics: #fear and #greed. 

I don't prefer the latter because it brings out #mediocrity. 

PS: Appluad for #MBS and his team for their oil support to #India !!!
7076 2018-12-06 14:10:55 Let's all realize that the world's problems in terms of oil prices stem from greed and domination.  It is time that a global change is necessary.  Free energy is what this calls for.
7077 2018-12-06 14:10:49 Oil and water don’t mix..
7078 2018-12-06 14:10:43 There is only a very weak C/CL influence because we are effectively maxed out with the ethanol we HAVE to put in the US gasoline stream...any additional cost Big Oil market share on gasoline...something they won’t do regardless of blending Econ’s.
7079 2018-12-06 14:10:39 Gotcha.  IMO EUR constructed to be attractive to Arab oil exporters.  IMO EUR's treatment of gold provides a big hint on their preferred "reserve asset" to settle imbalances; interestingly this dovetails w/PBOC pronouncemt above, & w/what Russia's been doing (sell UST, buy gold)
7080 2018-12-06 14:10:34 I'll be using "Big Oil Gutter Magic" in conversation today, if you don't mind
7081 2018-12-06 14:10:34 Total cut includes non-OPEC producers. If Alberta is in that number, then Russian output has to be accounted for. That means OPEC cuts themselves would be less than a million a day. Markets will not see that as favorable for the support of oil at present levels I don't think...
7082 2018-12-06 14:10:33 Canada's trade deficit grew to $1.2B in October, up from $891M in September. That's largely due to lower oil prices, causing the value of exports to drop. The amount of oil sold also fell by more than 16%. In addition, the cost of imports rose due to a weaker Canadian dollar.
7083 2018-12-06 14:10:32 To keep a lamp burning we have to keep putting oil in it.

7096 2018-12-06 14:09:42 It is becoming clearer that the 800 lbs gorilla at the OPEC+ meeting in Vienna, is the US--and specifically its embargo against Iran. The exemptions caught Saudis/OPEC off-guard. Are the exemptions going to be renewed? Also, note US oil exports hit record in Oct 2.33 mln bpd.

7105 2018-12-06 14:09:11 Is oil a inflationary commodity, we pump more than ever, why are we paying more?

- Oil weak, stocks weak, only thing bright green is $VIX
- Hate shorting more in the hole, but maybe intraday flags form

7125 2018-12-06 14:07:41 WE see that Trumps good frie nds, the Saudis, now want to cut oil production by 1,000,000 barrels per day to raise the price of oil...

7162 2018-12-06 14:04:04 The oil companies were aware of the climate consequences of CO2 far before it was public knowledge, and they sat on the science.  As a result, I’m terrified for what the climate will look like in my lifetime, let alone that of my nieces.

7280 2018-12-06 13:55:12 Hats off to @narendramodi . Piddi journos were criticising Modi on meeting MBS in G-20 Summit. Little they know that he was persuading Saudis to maintain the oil production and digging the grave of Piddis...  #CrudeOil #diplomacy

7290 2018-12-06 13:54:00 Watched a documentary.  Claimed the Germans were receiving plans for free energy, via those long haired women able to communicate telepathically to distant beings.  Claimed the entire war was over the fact oil barons would lose money/power.

7320 2018-12-06 13:52:10 And again, oil provides a ton of energy, so it's done it's job. And the fact they bring as much to market as they do with few harmful incidents is amazing. But overall, every time there is an incident with these companies, it really hurts them, not helps them.
7321 2018-12-06 13:52:08 @TonyChapman comments on @MorningShowCA that “we better wake up as a country” in reference to “oil being the oxygen of our economy” is right on point. Western alienation is real and needs to be recognized.

7327 2018-12-06 13:51:33 So the most possible case will be, IMO, a combine of 1,2&4, also, selling Nigeria's oil and other natural resources for the debt ( like the case of Venezuela)

7329 2018-12-06 13:51:26 Canada jumped pretty high when it comes to do business with China. Europe stayed close to Russia as it is depending on its oil, the US doesn’t and so when the US wanted to be more harsh towards Russia, the EU didn’t follow. Only Canada now is condemning vehemently Russia.

7340 2018-12-06 13:50:41 Interesting.  I’m not sure Alberta has any more an ‘oil problem’ than other regions of Canada since majority of the product is exported to meet demand elsewhere.

7373 2018-12-06 13:48:27 Thank you, Charles. My shale drilling stocks are feeling the pain of $50 oil. The sweet spot where consumers and producers are both getting by would seem to be around $60. Of course, I would prefer $100, but let's not be greedy.

7394 2018-12-06 13:46:47 Of course they do, but don’t be so foolish to believe that other politicians don’t take money from groups opposing oil and gas. Because they most certainly do. Why do you think very little consequential change takes place in Washington? Don’t fall for scam.

7410 2018-12-06 13:45:36 Have you ever tried Hemp Seed Oil? It’s one of the best oils for your face and doesn’t clog pores either. I find Olive a bit too much for my face, love it on my body though.
7411 2018-12-06 13:45:35 It's the same thing with candidates. Beto talked to oil guys, Kamala was a prosecutor etc etc. All republicans care about is HE'S NOT THEM.
Not saying that we shouldn't want better from people but they are so much better at holding their nose and voting just to win.

7425 2018-12-06 13:44:34 I agree, there is no reason to keep using oil when we already have renewable energies. The big oil fat cats usually have people bought off or killed that discover renewables.

7463 2018-12-06 13:41:08 Much of the oil is processed off shore and sold on without ever touching Scotland's shores. In 2014 alone, £37.3bn was taken and sold from what Westminster calls the "Unknown Region" (Scottish North Sea). None of it was attributed to Scotland.
7464 2018-12-06 13:40:55 Currently Eagle Ford oil is declining over 100% per year as companies have to drill 1.7 mill bpd to maintain a production of 1.4 mill bpd. Eagle Ford gas declines at 70% as many oil wells gas out.

7543 2018-12-06 13:34:47 In 5yrs, $5.2bil worth of oil was lost at petrojam(almst half of its entire output over tht period). Of that amount, 37% is completely unaccounted for. Yet for some inexplicable reason, the majority of posts i see focus on a 1000 dolla cake. 
5.2BILLION! CMON PEOPLE, FOCUS!
7544 2018-12-06 13:34:41 Well HEY, oil change Today’s an adulting day

7546 2018-12-06 13:34:34 Curves around G7 starting to invert. Bank of Canada was dovish referencing trade and oil prices are a headwind to inflation and growth yesterday.  SPX looks set up to test monthly lows. Optionality isn't priced high enough
7547 2018-12-06 13:34:31 4. Applying honey on skin can  reduce pain if you burn yourself with a straightener/ curling iron.

5. Rub an ice cube on your eyebrows before plucking them to reduce pain.

6. Mix some vegetable oil and lemon and apply it on dirty shoes with a cotton pad to get rid of the dirt.
7548 2018-12-06 13:34:20 Why do you think we do?  Certainly their oil is no longer vital to us.  If we didn't play favorites between the Saudis and Iranians we could buy whatever we want, have an open market to sell what we have, as well as the Chinese. And without the military cost of lives and fortune.
7549 2018-12-06 13:34:12 might wanna avoid simple light moisturiser since it has MO (mineral oil)
7550 2018-12-06 13:34:06 Lmao that explains the dry, 12 years a slave looking hair style. He dont even believe in coconut oil, olive oil, or a barber shop.
7551 2018-12-06 13:34:06 I assume, Don, that you'd give the same advice to oil cos that dramatically increase extraction to take advantage of low prices without the pipeline infrastructure in place to handle the extra capacity? "Take your time" is what you'd  tell them?
7552 2018-12-06 13:34:03 One would argue that it will be the tax cuts that cause the next recession. @gop hoping for growth that was terminated because of tariffs,trade wars,lower oil,and higher rates in anticipation of better growth. And @realDonaldTrump doesn't care about debt bc he won't be around!
7553 2018-12-06 13:33:54 Good human beings don’t go to war false pretenses and kill hundreds of thousands of civilians in an effort to steal another country’s oil.

Bush is a mass-murdering war criminal that condoned torture, and people should call him out for what he is any time he steps out in public.
7554 2018-12-06 13:33:40 Good for you. Very Typical
7555 2018-12-06 13:33:33 Hahaha! On a side note, have you tried  sprouts shredded then wok-fried (you can do it with real chilli and garlic and ginger, but Waitrose wok oil also works)? It’s delish.
7556 2018-12-06 13:33:33 I'm going to Artist Bootcamp this morning.  Going to start a picture of a lighthouse and I will do it in oil pastels.

7558 2018-12-06 13:33:16 Well at least we finally got the answer to the question we are always asking: why when oil prices worldwide drop, our gas prices go up or stay the same.
7559 2018-12-06 13:33:07 Agree with all of the above. And Timothy a snake, now making big bucks by slagging off the boss whose "red lines" he dictated. Hilton a snake oil guru who sold his soul to Fox and elsewhere
7560 2018-12-06 13:33:06 One more thing. If the major automakers are now moving towards electric cars, mass production to make them even more affordable, what becomes of the oil industry? What with gasoline being a huge portion of their businesss. I drive a hybrid. My consumption is down 50%.

7564 2018-12-06 13:32:41 U.S.  stock index futures fell more than 1.5 percent on Thursday, as the  arrest of a top executive of Chinese tech giant Huawei for extradition  to the United States sparked fears of a flare-up in Sino-U.S. tensions,  while sliding oil prices added to the pressure.

7569 2018-12-06 13:32:19 So Husky Oil can't clean up the spill as it has dispersed in rough seas.  Still, shouldn't three be some monetary consequence for making the poor decision to restart or continue drilling in high seas?  #nlpoli #cdnpoli #bigoil

7571 2018-12-06 13:32:04 It is only a matter of time before Trudeau declares the oil and gas industry in Canada state owned. Canada is quickly moving from a socialist democracy to an all out Communist country with the U.N as it's authority. Canada is now a direct threat to the Americans national security

7576 2018-12-06 13:31:37 Oil prices    fell 4 percent today  after Saudi Arabia's energy minister said that a cut of 1 million barrels per day would be enough for OPEC and its allied oil producers. Saudi Arabia has been leading calls for the group to trim output. (CNBC)

American First. 

Yeah, right.
7590 2018-12-06 13:29:51 Tell me Dan, what’s the current price of oil? How profitable is it? How much does it cost to take it out of the Tarsands? Who are the companies involved? Doesn’t increased supply lower the price? Do we control OPEC? VZ? Please explain.
7591 2018-12-06 13:29:47 Sana oil
7592 2018-12-06 13:29:46 Am saying alhamdulillah.
7593 2018-12-06 13:29:44 @BalakrishnanR sir,your view on PSU oil refinery? Valuations are very attractive. Dividend yield over 5 percent.
7594 2018-12-06 13:29:44 We are the top oil producer but we are not the top oil exporter.  Much of our oil goes into reserves and what’s left doesn’t meet demand.  Oil is a finite resource.  The country that invests in renewable energy will be the leading exporter going forward.
7595 2018-12-06 13:29:30 Just go vegetarian, eat ONE meal a day ... just vegies... and spices for taste (not salt) stir fries with max of half tblsp of OLIVE oil... cut out all sugar, fats, carbs & processed food ...after a few days your body adjusts, but you don't feel hungry #FruitAndVegies

7603 2018-12-06 13:28:51 I’m saying the low for oil is in and we rally until Thanksgiving 2019. There is some symmetry to that move. The massacre was Thanksgiving 2014. 5 years is a strong Fibonacci market number. Also all gaps filled so we have a clean chart
7604 2018-12-06 13:28:43 By fundamentals I mean valuations, GDP growth, corporate profits, the price of oil, and inflation generally. Those are bad when they are relatively high and good when they are relatively low.

7609 2018-12-06 13:28:22 Ummm what incentive would the us have to take on Alberta? They already have oil reserves that are cheaper to extract for them and they'd have to take on Alberta's financial burdens. Also they wouldn't immediately give Alberta statehood that would take decades ala Puerto Rico
7610 2018-12-06 13:28:07 Rupee ended weaker against the US Dollar. However, some losses were recovered, supported by sharp fall in crude oil prices post OPEC comments on output cuts. The Rupee ended at 70.90 vs. previous close of 70.47.
7611 2018-12-06 13:28:04 You can make it very differently, i think they do it in spain too, but gosh i hate them so much, they always look like you threw up on the plate and the dish itself is so greasy, portugal has a fetish with olive oil i swear

7615 2018-12-06 13:27:55 Government bond prices ended higher today as oil prices plunged after OPEC failed to arrive on any agreement regarding output cuts. Final decision on output cut to be taken tomorrow. Outcome of OMO buy auction along expected lines.
7616 2018-12-06 13:27:50 But what you are not going to do is ignore the repercussions that those texts have had across centuries in the oppression and murder of queer people. 

Christianity and homosexuality are like oil and water. No amount of mental gymnastics can explain that.
7617 2018-12-06 13:27:29 I can’t say I am surprised they are hammering oil again.
7618 2018-12-06 13:27:28 You do nothing about oil prices. Obama kept Prices down all through his presidency. You not half the man he is.

7630 2018-12-06 13:26:44 Nifty Breached 200-DMA, be cautious 50 DMA is crucial. mere fall in oil prices is not enough to sustain a bullish sentiments. Other factors such as local elections,  earnings cuts, rich valuations,still make the risk-reward unattractive. Both growth and margins cannot sustain 1/1
7631 2018-12-06 13:26:42 No, only one man is bootlicking MBS, not because of oil but because the Saudis are booking 500 rooms at a time in his hotels. The senators are already preparing paperwork to sanction.

7633 2018-12-06 13:26:40 Do we start worrying about high yield debt at oil companies again also?

7642 2018-12-06 13:25:54 Impossible because our economy is much more diverse than Venezuela, we arent dependent solely on oil to power our economy like Venezuela was. I feel like anti-Trudeau people arent well Informed.

7649 2018-12-06 13:24:36 Yes, yes we DO need higher oil prices - and higher fossil fuel prices in general.
Higher FF prices will drive demand for renewables (free markets, baby)
But we also need to take subsidies away from fossil fuel companies and switch them to renewables - For the Sake of Humanity.

7653 2018-12-06 13:24:11 Not sure what to make of the fact that G.H.W. Bush passed at the exact point in the semester when my class (commodity histories) and I discussed oil and the Gulf War, "African uranium" and the Iraq War, and then the War on Drugs...did my syllabus know something I didn't? 
7654 2018-12-06 13:24:11 Thought Accutane was the best thing to ever happen to my skin but I have to say, I never thought I'd find ANYTHING to take away my acne scars. Rosehip oil, my dudes. It works AND MY SKIN IS AS SOFT AS A BABY'S BOTTOM.

7656 2018-12-06 13:24:07 Has that one got palm oil Jim?
7657 2018-12-06 13:23:52 All I want for Christmas is palm oil.
7658 2018-12-06 13:23:45 Let's put this into context, #PhillipPaulwell tells @MorningAgenda. When @JamaicaPNP took office in 2011, #Petrojam's oil losses was 115,000 barrels per year. It was brought down to 49,000 barrels in 2016 and in two years, it has shot up to 184,000 barrels a year.
7659 2018-12-06 13:23:42 It is important that petrol prices remain stable. The government was forced to put pressure on the oil industry to keep prices down. If the situation aggravates once again, we can apply extreme measures and introduce so-called protective duties #MedvedevInterview
7660 2018-12-06 13:23:36 Don't beat yourself silly. I don't hate Muslims. I hate d ideology that drives d mad rage that's visible in every Islamic fundamentalist. D same ideology makes people like you intolerant of other people's view.

7662 2018-12-06 13:23:33 you put oil or whatever after it’s ready !!!
7663 2018-12-06 13:23:22 Even the robot is tired of the warehouse conditions at Amazon. Step up @JeffBezos, robots need more oil depositorys, they’re pissing in oil cans.
7664 2018-12-06 13:23:20 The young vote has been Googling Beto. They don’t like what they see: not for #MedicareForAll, voted for TPP & Wall Street & takes money from Big Oil execs. His time is done.
7665 2018-12-06 13:23:20 This will lead to the biggest rally in oil ever, unless bankers destroy the world. Either could happen.
7666 2018-12-06 13:23:17 I went this oil. How much money??
7667 2018-12-06 13:23:17 I take B12, vit D, 2000mg vit C a day (recommend) magnesium, 5-HTP (which I can't be without), and added cod liver oil recently too. I just played around to get a combination that works for me. Gentle yoga and meditation is good for fibro (I use Headspace). I can't exercise tho

7734 2018-12-06 13:17:51 For us 1.39mil working class people in the oil and gas industry within the U.S. (of which you had 90% of our vote) do need higher oil prices. If you allow prices to fall much farther it will greatly impacted your unemployment rate. We all know you don’t want that to happen sir!
7735 2018-12-06 13:17:49 I'm just a humble country boy but I'm confused as to why we are buying oil on the world market for more money than we are selling our oil to others for , isn't the secret of prosperity to sell things for more than you pay for them , anything contrary to that is folly
7736 2018-12-06 13:17:49 What a dumb tweet.

7775 2018-12-06 13:15:37 It feels like the price of oil inevitably goes lower - potentially single digits.  If I could produce/drill for oil at <$10 per barrel, why wouldn't I do it now?  Increase marketshare because shale is not profitable at the lower prices and fully utilize reserves.

7813 2018-12-06 13:11:38 So you think when the price of oil goes to $100 Canadians sell their oil at $60? Thats called arbitrage. Traders buy the $60 oil put it in a tanker and bring it to where the oil is $100. Oil is a global market traded on an exchange that establishes a benchmark price. I trade it

7815 2018-12-06 13:11:26 Not sure bhai. I don't clearly understand how this thing works. Also, under US sanction, there is a cap on how much oil Iran can sell to India. 90% of India's oil needs come from Iraq and Saudi.

7958 2018-12-06 12:59:38 I've bought oil already, and the sun is very bright nowadays so it's left for me to buy Iphone so I'll start posting pictures of sun kissing me up and down 
7959 2018-12-06 12:59:37 So the SNP DIDN'T give the tax break then.
Also oil has many more +ve uses than as a fossil fuel.
7960 2018-12-06 12:59:34 There was no specific problem as far as I know ... lots of geopolitical changes perhaps influenced by events in Iran. But certainly their cutting oil supplies in the 70s is the single most important event that shaped its importance and dominance. Now it is irrelevant.

7963 2018-12-06 12:59:09 I can tell that you are a well adjusted rational person brah, defiantly not a conspiracy nut job. Like me you clearly see it's about the economy and we have to ask why the NDP chose to increase international oil output and hurt Alberta. Luckily UCP have a plan... I think.
7964 2018-12-06 12:59:01 You do notice that your post makes no sense... right? Fracking allows US to control oil prices in a more authoritative way. And be mostly immune to OPEC production cuts.

7974 2018-12-06 12:58:24 This isn't about Labour, it's about the SNP's hypocrisy. You can't claim to be world leaders on climate whilst advocating maximum extraction of oil & gas.
7975 2018-12-06 12:58:24 We used to go to war, go off to work with only men building railroads or drilling oil fields, or go on other quests w men. This separation and proving ground gives men confidence in themselves. In our society men are never apart from influences of women.

7985 2018-12-06 12:57:30 There is more oil production and less demand now than in 2014-2015. The numbers are really skewed thanks to China's excessive demand for their strategic oil reserves. As soon as they switched to Iran from USA in October due to trade wars everything fell. #OOTT #OPEC

7991 2018-12-06 12:57:11 Oil is the only commodity that has its price fixed by a couple of fat cat nations. The consumer has always been held hostage to these debt ridden companies so it's about time to have free oil markets , even if that means some pain for these over leveraged countries and companies

8105 2018-12-06 12:44:40 The US sanctions every aspect of Venezuela's economy... Except oil. Perhaps because that is the one thing America NEEDS from Venezuela.

Ask yourself why the US has over 100 sanctions on Venezuela but zero on Chile or Finland or Denmark? What offends them about Venezuela?

8116 2018-12-06 12:43:42 Hey @AP Do you know if there was any oil drilling in the area or near the Alaska earthquake just before it happened? Did any human factor cause the shifting of the earth' s plates?
8117 2018-12-06 12:43:39 He claiming the low oil prices are the tax break.
8118 2018-12-06 12:43:35 I have a conspiracy theory:

Those 600 barrels of oil were used to pay for that expensive party but was done off the books.

So they could claim back for the money of the barrels of oil which aren't really missing.

8134 2018-12-06 12:42:22 There will be no country to run by the time I retire if we burn all of that oil & gas. The SNP want to burn it all. That is just incompatible with the survival of our civilisation, as the science the SNP allegedly recognise points out.

8180 2018-12-06 12:38:35 OPEC will be slowing production probably starting today.  What should worry you more is Canada is also planning on cutting production.  The US buys more oil from Canada than it does from OPEC.
8181 2018-12-06 12:38:33 But not the ones in the oil industry.

8188 2018-12-06 12:37:54 Government thinking... the US has a Strategic Oil Reserve although we export oil to the world and have the highest reserves of any producer going. We have stockpiled $20 billion in oil in the SOR while we ship that much out of the country regularly.... We could use that $
8189 2018-12-06 12:37:52 Is that the beautiful, clean oil? What about talking up renewables, so you aren’t supporting oil-producing countries run by murdering dictators?
8190 2018-12-06 12:37:40 We import about 6% of our oil from the Saudi’s! We don’t need them! We have more oil than they do! Use ours! Screw them!

8208 2018-12-06 12:35:49 That is going to be a hard trick to perform. Across 2015-2016 about 123,000 oil workers lost their jobs (I was one). Meanwhile wind energy employ roughly 5,000 workers, both on and offshore. Still about 300,000 employed in oil and gas across the UK.
8209 2018-12-06 12:35:36 Hey Mr. Trump I'm a large supporter of you and your policies, but please as an American oil and gas investor please stay out of this industry and let our companies profit from higher prices. If American's can't afford gas prices at say 3.50$ they need to budget better.
8210 2018-12-06 12:35:34 That’s right! They meet today don’t they? Gonna suck for you if they increase oil prices and slow production
8211 2018-12-06 12:35:31 @realDonaldTrump The world needs to be prepared for a full boycott of Iranian oil, the dirty capitalist system must never reach its goal. I said that changing the regime in Iran is inevitable.

8232 2018-12-06 12:33:37 People like you that's the embarrassment Ian Blackford is a lovely man , all he's trying to do is get Westminster to involve Scotland Obviously you don't give a damn about Scotlands fishermen , oil ,natural resources , you should be proud of yourrrrrr heritage not Westminsters
8233 2018-12-06 12:33:34 Baby don’t mind this proud girl, use weed for your edges...stimulate the scalp around your edges for 10 minutes twice a day, that’s twenty minutes in total, use vitamin e oil and stop making your hair at all, use wigs only, do this for about 6months to a year if you’re serious.

8237 2018-12-06 12:33:14 Humans aren't the problem. The vast majority of people worldwide live sustainably. This rhetoric is trying to blame billions of poor people for the actions of the very wealthiest. The problem is oil companies, and big financial monopolies who are destroying our planet.

8247 2018-12-06 12:32:07 Looking at America's response to the Saudi's killing of Khashoggi, perhaps ED needs to get oil flowing out of this Invictus project, then the US would bootlick him like they're doing MBS.

8252 2018-12-06 12:31:49 @realDonaldTrump Saudi Arabia needs to make sure that oil production stays stable, oil production should remain stable for the full boycott of Iranian oil, which is vital to us
8253 2018-12-06 12:31:31 Most of the world would like to get off the oil tit.
8254 2018-12-06 12:31:26 Why certain quarters like to add oil into fire, instead of giving moral support to the family of the victims who perished in the ambushed.

8261 2018-12-06 12:31:01 I HOPE THAT AFRICA MUST RELY ON AFRICA FOR A PROSPEROUS AFRICAN CONTINENT.  AFRICA HAS GOT OIL , MANGANESE,  GOL,PLATINUM,  IRON,  COFFEE AND OTHER IMPORTANT MINERAL RESOURCES ONLY IF WE HAVE THE SAME ECONOMICAL & FINANCIAL SYSTEM & PRINCIPLES

8272 2018-12-06 12:30:17 Medicare should never have paid for routine stuff in the first place - and neither should insurance. Only seek to transfer risk that would devastate you. It is unwise to transfer risk for stuff you can afford. Don’t ask the government or insurance to pay for oil changes!

8282 2018-12-06 12:29:33 Oh no... This nonsense can ONLY mean one thing. The Saudis (MBS) are going to hold us hostage to oil prices. On second thought that's what they've always done. I can feel another big drop in the stock market coming. Damn this POTUSDOTARD is a -bird!

8284 2018-12-06 12:29:28 The premise is that because lots of people who work in Oil and Gas donated to Beto, that’s a problem. There are multiple holes in the argument. One is that people in all industries gave. Another is that a gas station attendant counts towards the total.

You are a purity cult.

8295 2018-12-06 12:28:57 I believe in both sides too. Oil is not going away, so we need to spend more to make it go away faster.
8296 2018-12-06 12:28:56 I agree. Let’s take action and stop buying Saudi oil.
8297 2018-12-06 12:28:55 Did trump impose sanctions on iran for the sole purpose of assisting Saudi Arabia oil production?

8303 2018-12-06 12:28:38 I auto dislike oil companies for being species traitors but I'm willing to hear Shell out because of their policies that last few years. Even going so far to set carbon reduction goals that impact their checkbooks if they fail. Oil companies never hurt their checkbooks.
8304 2018-12-06 12:28:32 Just looked at ingredients in #OliveSpread from #Morrisons - assumed it was olive oil in some form. No - rapeseed/PALM. Won’t be buying again. Really need to look closer at products with oil in #PalmOil

8310 2018-12-06 12:27:59 Maybe If oil price had stayed low and Naira/$ rate had stayed at N520 or higher, but that happened in Zimbabwe and nothing changed. I don’t think Nigeria is redeemable. The country may not survive from the sort of shock that is needed to reform the system.

8312 2018-12-06 12:27:52 There is not a “both sides” to the science behind climate change. It is factual, and presents a horrific reality for our future generation.

Undertarget inflation in 2019, means ECB could even get away with restarting QE to save Italy in Eurozone by stealth, without losing credibility.

US markets still overvalued short any rally there

8336 2018-12-06 12:26:04 Agree on most of them except the call for a halt in LNG. LNG is avilable now and nearly eliminates air emissions (SOx, NOx, PM). Or do you prefer that LNG-fueled ships go back to oil whilst waiting for someone to come up with a silver bullet? If so, plz let us know asap.

8344 2018-12-06 12:25:09 Svært velkomment. Kosk har riktignok mye av æren for at Oil i det hele tatt er med i mixen, så håper de stiller enda høyere krav før #33 er førstevalg igjen.
8345 2018-12-06 12:25:07 The Saudis' transition from oil to solar anticipates 200GW by 2030 and 20% of EU demand by 2050. Transmission line research is underway, but, like the planned Australia-Japan project, they could could ship that solar power to the world as green H2 just as they ship oil today.

8349 2018-12-06 12:24:49 I don't think lower oil hurts American jobs. More pocket money = greater spending. More travel = greater spending on both fuel & food, fun.
8350 2018-12-06 12:24:47 Oil factors in to an extent much, much lesser than most people assume. It is mostly about prestige, ideology and a security / geopolitical-control vision that encompasses most of northern half of African continent.

8355 2018-12-06 12:24:34 Remember there are millions of barrels of WTI just sitting in Texas that could easily be used to just replace the SPR should you decide to just sell it off. Sell off the SPR then buy the oil back at a discount. How’s that for a deal?

8364 2018-12-06 12:23:36 Fracking is just a more effecient mesns of extracting resources. And nothing has been better for human well being then oil and gas.  It has improved the lives of billions and billions of people.  You mention the downside & ignore the many more positives.  Learn about tradeoffs.
8365 2018-12-06 12:23:34 Yep. But like, we all know there's more than just carbs in some stuff, for instance the amount of oil that is in a pizza is really unhealthy if eaten frequently.

8371 2018-12-06 12:23:07 FFA: Levels are mixed this AM with Capes flat to a bit firmer in places while PMX is softer nearby and SMX flattish.  Expecting PMX/SMX/Handy to be flattish - oil prices have fallen 5% as Saudi says OPEC hasn’t yet reached a deal on cutting back production.
8372 2018-12-06 12:22:46 I have put truffle oil in tho', yummmmm.
8373 2018-12-06 12:22:37 Pity you're still using palm oil though.
8374 2018-12-06 12:22:36 I'm willing to pay more, if it means not doing business with the monster who ordered the deaths of Mr Khashoggi and so many others in Yemen. This isn't the 70s. We learn from our mistakes. We are not dependent on Saudi Oil. Listen to our CIA, not MbS!

8383 2018-12-06 12:21:24 that's an excellent essay. How much of this support, in your opinion, can be derived from materialist concerns re supply of oil/energy?  How much control of oil fields and ports does he control and does this factor into French support?
8384 2018-12-06 12:21:08 A quart, Stephen said. There’s nothing smutty in it. I use my time as critic. I think they've balanced three budgets out of the Oil and 1/3

8403 2018-12-06 12:19:38 It is true that investment exercised so far by Oil Cos in Mexico is a fraction of what PEMEX invest in Mexico and a fraction of total expected investment; however, that is understandable due to regular cycle on this kind of investments.

8506 2018-12-06 12:08:01 what is surprising with attending a raise of price while implementing sanction on the third oil producer of the planet..? Do you think talking to a bench of 
moron Donald..? What is artificial with the hike of oil Price when the third oil supplier is targeted by US sanctions.

You can get the General Permit. Doesn't cost much.
8528 2018-12-06 12:05:21 That's what I hear...during my weekly appearances on @moneytalk1690, we often hear about how important higher oil prices are to many folks in Colorado
8529 2018-12-06 12:04:52 I already forgot the kind of oil @Rae_Von wanted me to get. 
8530 2018-12-06 12:04:40 Dependent on oil products start riding bikes everywhere and walking everywhere don't use any form of transportation that consumes an ounce of oil and when that happens maybe you'll be taking serious until then shut up

8541 2018-12-06 12:02:15 Yes, yes I do.
Humans used about 34 BILLION BARRELS of oil and liquid fuel last year. About 8.7 billion tons of coal. And the current rate for loss of species is at least 1,000 times higher than natural rates of extinction.
We're killing our planet, and it will kill our posterity

8544 2018-12-06 12:01:50 @sully If by big oil you "national" oil companies you would be correct.  If you mean the independent big oil companies you would be wrong. BTW. Exxon, the biggest,  only supplies about 3% of the world's daily oil needs.
8545 2018-12-06 12:01:48 The oil money the UK squandered was a scandal, frankly.
8546 2018-12-06 12:01:45 What if the Oil Market is too focused on "Supply" side economics - and its not the real problem. - a) inverted yield curves (fell below 2.9%) on 10Yr Treasuries b) Oil can't seem to stay above $50 keeps falling c)Markets keep falling

a+b+c might be Demand side argument.

8554 2018-12-06 12:00:41 @dennisbroox @kalilahrey government should offer a reward for information leading to the arrest of anyone who was involved with the theft of oil from Petrojam.

8637 2018-12-06 11:51:20 I agree on contracts and that Nurse has a higher ceiling he needs to hit. I do think Russell is at his ceiling for play. I don’t see Sekera every playing a full season in Oil jersey again. Would love Bouchard called up after WJ. Seeing how JP is under Hitch I think B could play.
8638 2018-12-06 11:51:19 Saudi Arabia, being major producer, has recently  increased its production by 4.1% to 33.3 m barrels per day. It is expected that supply cut will be aimed to avert glut situation which dragged down crude oil price by approximately 30%.

8639 2018-12-06 11:51:18 @JeffFlake given what’s happening with the Khasoggi murder and climate change, can you think if any better reasons to cast off oil and the corruption that comes with it. Introduce a Senate counterpart to HR 7173 and start the drive to 100% renewables!

8659 2018-12-06 11:48:00 Actually, it sort of is. OPEC cuts raise profits and because the US has a free market, more wells get built in the US by private companies. That then brings the price back down under break-even for OPEC. $100 oil is a thing of the past. Adapt or die.

8772 2018-12-06 11:34:45 The point is Trump did not swing into office on a wave of a landslide victory. He hobbled across the finish line to be greeted by a majority of Americans that see him as snake oil salesman and won't tolerate their country being led by a B-List Reality Star.

8831 2018-12-06 11:26:44 That's if we assume a share of the deficit and/or UK debt - which we won't. You are aware Scotland has a £100bn export economy, before income tax, corporation tax, oil and gas revenue - all of which could be managed differently to current UK methods?
8832 2018-12-06 11:26:38 We want them to discuss Canada's oil problem! Maritimes have to buy Saudis oil at $90 a barrel! Could be using western oil at less  than half that! THAT is OUR Canadian problem!

8835 2018-12-06 11:26:03 Israel has begun expelling Black people. Israel, Libya & Saudi Arabia are all equally guilty of human rights violations. They all need to be held accountable. Bottom line is not even race, culture or religious based policies. It's about money & controlling the oil.

8837 2018-12-06 11:25:42 Yes that was a milestone in Nam geosciences. I know there is a sense that few people feel it was not real oil but it was. Few models can explain why no big reservoir is discovered yet.

8849 2018-12-06 11:23:45 Correlation is not causation. It’s not necessarily because the neoliberals were in charge at the zenith of our economic system that the current collapse can be entirely attributed to them. The end of the Trente Glorieuses also coincides with the end of cheap oil for example.

Today Crude Oil prices fell more than 4 % due to OPEC's announcement about production cut.
8851 2018-12-06 11:23:26 From my basic knowledge of the matter, oil supply is controlled by OPEC, but the price is the market price.

8853 2018-12-06 11:23:13 Uk awards the licences, the oil companies pay for the exploration, extraction and decommissioning. The uk collects the tax on any profits. Not all oil fields are viable. Some heavy oil and difficult to extract fields may never be viable.

9039 2018-12-06 10:59:16 Yes have done well this year but remains highly dependent on oil price so guessing many investors will want to know what OPEC are doing before diving in.
9040 2018-12-06 10:59:00 Lol! Given all of these, what's your current outlook on oil?

9042 2018-12-06 10:58:57 Especially the oil spills, I’ll never forget the birds and animals coated in oil.
9043 2018-12-06 10:58:55 Gulf states sussed wests plan that all their oil would be used up first so they have invested heavily in western infastructure/property/media/academia. Gov have sold everything but crown jewels as part of their NWO agenda, no independent nation states.

9049 2018-12-06 10:58:08 But you recently said that America produces all the oil it needs, so what do you care what OPEC do????... or was that just another ego serving lie on your part ?
9050 2018-12-06 10:58:07 “laying part of the blame on an unexpected surge in the appetite for oil as people around the world not only buy more cars but also drive them farther than in the past — more than offsetting any gains from the spread of electric vehicles.”

9335 2018-12-06 10:24:58 I forgot that oil does not boil in high heat.  I even covered the sauce pan with a lid so that it speeds up to a boil.  wtf brain.
9336 2018-12-06 10:24:41 am one of the largest conversions on currency , selling oil for the short window we will have it , will be more than enough to create reserves of other currencies , that takes dropping the Dollar standard.

Its also why Libya and Iraq were bombed to shit for stopping doing so.
9337 2018-12-06 10:24:35 So bloody what. You @KarenAttiah @LindseyGrahamSC what you are going to do with it. 
You are giving yourself an authority that you don’t have over a Sovereign Country. If only Saudi Arabia decides to sell oil in a currency other than the dollar.
The Dollar will be a Turkish Lira

9370 2018-12-06 10:19:02 Since the U.S. is now the major producer of oil, why are we not setting the price on oil? Great opportunity to export more oil to compete with OPEC, Venezuela and Russia and drive oil prices down using ANWR, fracking, oil shale, and more internal and off shore oil production.

Correct, by accident.  The price of oil needs to drop because nobody is using this outdated CO2 producing, polluting, fuel.

9657 2018-12-06 09:49:53 Palm oil needs to go out of biofuels. Like any vegetable oil or other biomass grown for that purpose only. That's possible, fast measures. Reducing palm oil demand from the food and detergents sector is a very different story. Substitution with other oils has no benefits here.
9658 2018-12-06 09:49:43 "By withdrawing from OPEC, Qatar signals the forthcoming end of oil as the driver of the world’s future growth and anticipates the rising importance of natural gas" Totalmente de acuerdo, esto marca el comienzo de la nueva era.

9735 2018-12-06 09:40:50 You suggested AB has the lowest taxes and that there’s room to increase them. Such backward logic. Trudeau has the ability to take steps to increase the price of Canadian oil. Something we can all benefit from and enable us to match the AB tax rates

9747 2018-12-06 09:39:55 Excellent thread Andrew.  How about instead, subject pipelines to some merchant risk (price, volume, credit)? So if the oil isn’t there down the road (because of climate policy or otherwise), they bear the cost.

9762 2018-12-06 09:38:16 Strangely enough: Big Oil not only increases profit with increasing gas prices (= not sensible less selling), but even when it decreases (= more selling). That's also why seriously fighting #ClimateChange it's a tough task. (More complex than that, but one of the main points).
9763 2018-12-06 09:38:06 Yes it shouldn’t be directly applied to the skin dilute it with a carrier oil like coconut oil , olive oil or, almond oil. I like to dilute mine with a serum like  vitamin c or rosehip oil . In some cases I’ll mix it in with my Shea butter.

9875 2018-12-06 09:22:47 Yes but we know chemo did not “cure” me because the cancer came back in 2013. If I wanted to make a correlative “conclusion” from my anecdote,I would say cannabis oil cured my cancer as I have been clear for 4 years as opposed to 9 months post chemo  and without the side effects

9882 2018-12-06 09:21:02 machinations between the govt and big oil countries that benefits no-one except these two groups and we as taxpayers, (assuming you are working) are just the mugs living on this suffering planet. They are not good guys and you are super naive if you think they are...2
9883 2018-12-06 09:20:48 Me too! Though, since I've never flown in my life, it's rather simple. I'd already decided as a hippyish teenager in the Sixties that oil could not go on forever...
9884 2018-12-06 09:20:47 Oil Prices fell ahead of a meeting by producer group OPEC that is expected to result in a supply cut aimed at draining a glut that has pulled down crude prices by 30 percent since October.
9885 2018-12-06 09:20:38 Crude Oil has come down by 30% in the last one month in Dollar terms. Has the Petrol/Diesel Prices also come down by that percentage? Apparently, it seems NO. @arunjaitley @Swamy39 @narendramodi @dpradhanbjp @CNBC_Awaaz @MirrorNow @aajtak @ZeeBusiness @abpnewstv

9888 2018-12-06 09:20:27 Biofuel oil from plants like rape and soybean can be boosted by gene editing to give a product with a price that compares to fossil oil. Of course it won’t be produced in the EU as such research is not allowed by the German Greens who make the laws. Whose side are they on?
9889 2018-12-06 09:20:25 I didn't say it will reduce our oil import bill. But of course you right. Heat?? what about that?

9900 2018-12-06 09:19:23 I don’t agree. I think our problems will remain with us...but I agree good political leadership wud help in working through some of the problems we have.

9930 2018-12-06 09:15:04 The point of the cold water is to put a brake on the heat. Doesn't let it burn your skin deeper. You can worry about scars when you're alive.
Plus people have different skin types. They may be lucky that they don't scar badly. It's not the engine oil.

9953 2018-12-06 09:11:55 The media aren't downplaying or up playing anything. They're simply reporting what 98% of scientists agree on.
