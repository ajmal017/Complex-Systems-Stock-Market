30 2018-01-03 22:23:32 Definitely not stocks.  Short-Term bonds would be the best value at that point.  I'm curious if we will see a repeat of 2007/2008 in commodities between now and the inversion of the bond yield curve.  I'm positioned for that to happen...but who know.

40 2018-01-03 21:45:55 But the next step will be that gold will take the place of the bond market of the last cycle. Silver will eventually deflate with other commodities as inflation is beat. But gold will not deflate w/ commodities. It will be the focal point of the next cycle.

63 2018-01-03 20:21:39 Simplest explanation is that plane tickets are commodities. Price goes up when demand is higher. But that doesn’t fully account for the myriad of other factors.

90 2018-01-03 18:17:11 “”””under socialism”””” is it really a surprise that one of the most demanded commodities is used up quickly? That’s as capitalistic as anything else.
91 2018-01-03 18:13:21 I read your pain. :) Hope for next time or for new commodities coming our way.
92 2018-01-03 18:04:25 Very good point, Dan, and look at USO. While oil prices have risen, USO market cap is the same as its daily volume: $2m.  If currencies weaken (I think they'll do the opposite the next 2 yrs), commodities will be hot. Otherwise, only good for short-term bets.

96 2018-01-03 17:55:45 La secuencia es: precios energía sube -> dólar cae -> commodities sube -> inflación sube -> tasas sube -> crisis desarrollados -> todo cae
97 2018-01-03 17:54:01 Funds starting to see commodities as under-valued relative to equities. Growing global economy creates stronger demand base for commodities. It's a macro development that could help put the bottom behind us as we work through large supplies. Cheap prices have built demand.
98 2018-01-03 17:51:53 Now you are taking about commodities traders, but they did cause the collapse. It is when they realize the commodities they were trading in had no value. Because the loans they were based on were going to fail.

107 2018-01-03 17:20:40 There is an essential commodities act, and prices of only those notified commodities can be fixed and that too only in very limited specified circumstances. Not sure what the legal justification is for preventing price increase in other cases.

127 2018-01-03 16:19:57 On a real basis yes, but again, key IMO is that only US has reserve currency, only US has 43-yr old monopoly on pricing of commodities.  That monopoly must be ended to avoid true calamity (& it is being ended rapidly.)
128 2018-01-03 16:19:54 Kenyan workers pay about 30% and basic commodities 16%.whats special about sportpesa so that they can be taxed less?
129 2018-01-03 16:18:08 So its also a domino effect since transportation of goods are powered by fuel po tataas din ang prices of commodities. Tapos ang taas ng taxes on coal, cars, ssb is incremental. Every year tataas ng tataas po.

132 2018-01-03 16:08:50 Agreed!  Where most of our commodities are imported,  shouldn't be begin to see a drop in the price of what questions consume ? Or is this idealistic view of things and basically,  ' it naah go happen ' when we have greedy merchants exploiting consumers. Scamming in all levels!
133 2018-01-03 16:04:51 Hitler...  Yes
When the Church in 30's gave way to culture, fear, to be hip, liked, powerful (today too)instead of counter culture. It's role is to speak to the value greater than what culture defines as valued- innocent, elderly, dick, widowed, orphan, poor. Not as commodities!
134 2018-01-03 16:04:17 Greece's has neither the world's reserve currency, nor a 43-year old monopoly on the pricing of oil/commodities.  Which means unless the world ends the USD's monopoly in global oil trade, the US will hyperinflate the price of oil & crash the global econ to pay this debt.
135 2018-01-03 16:01:47 germany will never wake up one day and discover the price of a new BMW is half what is was a year ago. they control the price of a BMW. we, in south africa, do not control the price of the raw commodities we dig up. our economic policy is to HOPE platinum prices go up.

138 2018-01-03 15:51:52 Commodities have been cheap for 5 years & anyone who's realized this (you have) has probably dabbled and gotten in too early and has lots of red ink and losses to show for it now. Commodities have not been a sector that you can comfortably ease into.

148 2018-01-03 15:17:53 I keep reading articles about commodities in general being cheap.  Then they reference commodities that grow in the ground and the possibility of La Nina.  When I see what looks like "fund behavior" early in the year I pay attention.  I'm not bullish fundamentally, but...
149 2018-01-03 15:16:38 Yes. Just took my profit on Sugar. "Risk" is that this reflation trade unwinds ST as yields go higher. Double whammy for commodities. Real rates through the roof. But could also just be a ST PB before higher. Watch the key levels.

154 2018-01-03 15:02:53 Animal cruelty is illegal, however when animals are used as commodities they aren't granted the same protection. People shouldn't need told how to behave, they should think of the consequences for other beings. Veganism is about morality

163 2018-01-03 14:39:11 The last time commodities were this undervalued was at the end of the 90s. 2000-2001 recession still made oil price lose 50%. Then the rally you mention.

247 2018-01-03 07:52:58 Imagine this. In our briefing yesterday, our finance person reported about the revised tax table and everyone (DDS) rejoiced until I made the reminder that commodities are up as well. I got daggers.
248 2018-01-03 07:51:40 Politically illiterate people are complaining over the increased price on basic commodities. Hello? It was you who elected for those bastards. Damn!

255 2018-01-03 07:26:09 .... No bad qualities. So you telling this man living like Jesus? Cussing people out, acting like a child about nuclear weapons, objectifying women, no gentleness, no fruits of the spirit. Not an empathetic bone in his body. We the people are commodities to him. You are blind.
256 2018-01-03 07:18:10 Taxing it isn't eliminating it. The NDP increased taxes have raised the price of living in Alberta, and raising the minimum wage to $15 does more harm than good. So all that's occurred are costs of commodities being raised. You forgot we also need "reliable" energy...
257 2018-01-03 07:17:26 Modi Jee, like Sharad Pawar, please also award Padam Vibhushan to his and P. Chidambaram’s protege Jignesh Shah for successfully masterminding biggest fraud in commodities trade (NSEL Scam).
258 2018-01-03 07:13:24 With the impending fuel price increase because of TRAIN, i hope people are ready for the price increase of commodities, and especially in fare price increases of Boats, Jeepney, Bus, GRAB, UBER, & I’d assume airlines & boats too.

261 2018-01-03 07:01:18 I dunno about this whole "finding the button" thing, but I'd never go to another country to "find a wife".
They're women. They're people. 
I know the whole "mail order brides" is a thing, but I'd never, ever do it.
They aren't commodities that I can order off Amazon Prime.
262 2018-01-03 06:56:06 Well that is a front for something. Commodities in Somalia???????
263 2018-01-03 06:55:09 Yeah fastest growing in asia when it comes to prime commodities di na mag hihirap ang mahihirap dahil mangangamatay na
264 2018-01-03 06:50:56 Self-care need not be defined only by commodities that capitalist patriarchy makes available to women. Often these things become temporary moments of relief from our continuing circumstances of oppression and exploitation.

267 2018-01-03 06:37:28 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
268 2018-01-03 06:33:03 What a start of the year by these markets... buoyant global growth, core rates selling off, stocks up, commodities up, WTI above $60 and  Gold notching a 12th day of gains in the last 13 sessions. Who cares about Bitcoin??...
269 2018-01-03 06:25:26 @sonnyangara malaki nga take home pay pero lahat ng basic commodities tataas naman.... hayy nako. diesel palang ubos na agad ung extra pay sa tax cut.......... kainis

272 2018-01-03 06:10:05 Sana pag nagpataw ng buwis sa mga negosyante ay bawal ipasan o ipasa sa mga prime commodities dahil sa bawat buwis na ipapataw ay ang mahihirap ang lalong nahihirapan.
273 2018-01-03 06:08:00 #Gold is headed for a roughly 2.3% gain for December, its best month since August. Bigger picture, #goldfutures are headed for a gain of 13.4% this year based on the most active contract. #Commodities #CommoditiesTrading #CommodityPrices #GoldTrading #GoldMining #GoldPrices

275 2018-01-03 05:59:44 The war on drugs is a decrepit facade, the capitalist state wants you to get high on commodities.
276 2018-01-03 05:55:09 When fuel prices go up and especially that much, it's going to hit hard and hit the poor the hardest because basic commodities and transport expenses are also expected to go up.
277 2018-01-03 05:53:53 again ...its tricky ...coz momentum is everything... the impact is not clear coz  USD is at a critical zone if it doesnt break down below 91 commodities wont move up. rare scenario but possible yields move up with dollor also moving up thats the killer blow for most quants
278 2018-01-03 05:50:40 If you give the common sense answers to those questions, then you agree with Marx that surplus value creation is imminent in markets and commodities as the basis of social reproduction.   You buy into the whole of Capital, even if you don't emotionally accept it.

284 2018-01-03 05:02:55 The increase in price has more to do with the value of the dollar than supply-demand cycles. Most commodities are trending upwards. Lots of negative headwinds for oil, US-Shale production as they are already drilled and ready for prod, as well as aggressive trends towards EV's.
285 2018-01-03 05:00:01 Commodities: Canola +1.85%, Ethanol -1.72%
286 2018-01-03 04:35:18 Sorry man, not seeing it. This KU team needs more than two unknown commodities to win another title.
287 2018-01-03 04:34:32 You can THANK Obama for it all MORON! 76 straight months of positive increased in Stoc Markets & Commodities. Trump came into a already Great Economy w/Corps making record profits after OBAMA who saved USA from Depression caused by Bush/GOP. Trumps Fiscal YR started on 10/1/17!
288 2018-01-03 04:33:31 In a battle foot soldiers are commodities, the real victory is of the leaders who plan the strategy. Fail to see how this is a victory of the Mahars. Respect the British if they were able to defeat a numerically superior side through proper attack tactics.
289 2018-01-03 04:24:06 “poly” can mean lots of different things, but IMO in startups:
- mixed gender married couple who wants to mess around with women: 50%
- straight single man who wants to treat women as commodities rather than partners: 49%
- actual poly: 1%

295 2018-01-03 03:28:24 One of my biggest hates is how climate change solutions are becoming commodities, making them upper middle class solutions to a problem that transcends class structures.
296 2018-01-03 03:08:23 What is the fair price of bitcoin and how do you calculate it.  There are methods for stock, bonds, and even commodities and derivatives.
297 2018-01-03 03:03:19 The price of #gold reacted to the war of words between President Trump and Kim Jong-un. But the incidents related to North Korea failed to trigger anything but a short-term and limited response in the #goldmarket. #Commodities #GoldPrices #GoldFutures #GoldTrading #Bullion

310 2018-01-03 02:00:35 When people start complaining about the cost of basic commodities, there's a bigger problem than just that. We need to talk about buying power instead.
311 2018-01-03 01:58:43 Our economy is growing fast, Brian? What planet do you live on, sir? Housing prices are becoming unaffordable. Basic food & commodities are way too expensive. Homelessness is rampant! Billions are wasted on a rail to nowhere. People are fleeing Hawaii due to economy. But I'm not.
312 2018-01-03 01:49:22 Agree, moreover what we hv witnessed is high price on commodities like water, food along with unfair prices on rixa rent making it difficult for common visitors and students to make it. My feeling that all the monument will be polluted like Taj Mahals
313 2018-01-03 01:23:52 And you wonder why China is massing equipment & troops along it's border & RUS is supplying DPRK covertly with sanctioned commodities...keep laughing at his tweets...laugh all the way until that first shell or TLAM is thrown...because it's coming...this train isn't stopping

317 2018-01-03 01:11:22 Money would then be replaced by: commodities (water, food, shelter, land) barter. We're so programmed to not give something for nothing...those with more power would still victimize those without. Power/Human Rights has to be first - we're all equal, with equal power.
