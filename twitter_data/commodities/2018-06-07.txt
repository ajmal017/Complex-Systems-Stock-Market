84 2018-06-07 17:33:23 That's untrue, value is not determined by labor, it is subjective. Wages are set like all other commodities, as a result of supply and demand. Very few people are capable of inventing something like the Iphone, pretty much anyone can sweep the building they're sold in.

108 2018-06-07 16:15:33 A free market specifically does not check for quality etc, rather it allows the consumer to determine the demand for the commodities and evaluate their value for themselves to decide whether or not a game is worth the asking price.

194 2018-06-07 09:23:06 Today maybe  a similar deal should be a little  more intricate since now there is a larger  awareness around the world  that the interests in buying not just commodities but infrastructure and companies  to get footholds n interesting areas might be damaging.
195 2018-06-07 09:08:15 i think if you consider returns across their ag portfolio they’d likely be relatively uncorrelated w /exposure across different production regions (rainfall) & commodities. As long as their portfolio is reasonably balanced I don’t think depositors have much to worry about.

235 2018-06-07 05:09:46 What a Smart move from China... Let's Not forget Why did countries went to Wars in the past? Yes... A Large part of it is due to Dominance and Control of resources and commodities... So to have that Naiive thinking that we can always depend on our allies in Strategic resources...

240 2018-06-07 04:49:31 Mubina, we do not know of a good snapshot of commodities action apart from yours! Keep sharing with us this invaluable info so that we all can connect the dots in equities space too. Thanks a ton!

242 2018-06-07 04:42:13 I think it is but really on the bright side there ARE in this world to satisfy a Trump. Ample tits and ego strokes if good forces could actually deliver those commodities at a rate outweighing same from evil forces. New kind of arms race coming?

244 2018-06-07 03:56:42 Commodities gonna commoditize
245 2018-06-07 03:42:51 What about traditional markets? One way to somehow oversee how crypto market is gonna perform is to estimate the total crash of stock market/commodities. People need to spend the money they made from shorting the crash somewhere safe + new investors panic buy into crypto hype
246 2018-06-07 03:37:24 See.........XAG.........made a high @16.736 range yesterday.........against buy @16.370-16.340 range this week..........see call 1sttttttt-----what next??????

250 2018-06-07 03:02:53 Henrique... comentarios a item 6.0 do Twwite que vc colocou toa justificar a depreciação do real na Dilma

Se notar, houve um descolamento enorme entre o as commodies e o real entre 2008-2014. Commodities cairam violentamente e real ficou “sobreapreciado” nesse intervalo.
251 2018-06-07 03:00:29 YES!

253 2018-06-07 02:44:00 someone please set me up on a date i'll pay u in whatever commodities you want
254 2018-06-07 02:41:09 @realDonaldTrump my name is Joe. you are the leader of this country.
have mr Kelly request that he receive an unredacted report from Horowitz by 4:00 PM tmw. If not received then have Mr Kelly fire Rosenstein. This is major cover up. worked in commodities an this is unacceptable.
255 2018-06-07 02:39:03 Oil is a deregulated commodities...

Thoda economics padh loo...UPA-2 mai inflation 11 percent thaaa...
Abhi 4.50 percent hai..

Most of the people in India travel by public transport...

Ohhh u are worried about Pappu, bcoz he drives Land Cruzer, Average  5 km/L..  
256 2018-06-07 02:33:41 If you have one really good qb and relative unknown commodities at backup, you don't have depth, you're in the shallow end.
If you have two, or three good QBs that have shown they can win games, then you have depth.
257 2018-06-07 02:28:32  Querido PocasTrancas debido a la inestabilidad del peso frente a otras divisas experimentaremos un aumento de los commodities el próximo 1 de julio, lo que se verá reflejado en un aumento generalizado y sostenido de los precios, por lo que nuestro poder adquisitivo disminuirá
258 2018-06-07 02:23:32 bodies as commodities, the more suffering the more the medical & pharma industrial complexes (et al.) makes their $$ yay capitalism. polypharmacy in later life is fucking madness, but who gaf ching ching & colonialism will never willingly give up control of human minds & bodies.
259 2018-06-07 02:16:24 the only difficulty is the paranoid fear that a single woman is an undercover (((thot))).  other than that, they’re hawt commodities.
260 2018-06-07 02:09:02 RBI makes its first hike since 2014 prompting the burden of servicing to local states..
Indian States Pilots should be implemented in redemption bonds programms in lower commodities environments and lower overseas rates benchmark to come.
261 2018-06-07 02:01:26 The market is nothing but a poker table. A place where players sit and risk funds on potential outcomes.

As the valuation of stock/bonds/commodities grows, the larger the market (or playing field) gets.
262 2018-06-07 01:55:54 Aha!
But, keeping the wealth (or creating it for that matter) by following that path is not going to be sustainable in the long term. The immiseration and the pauperization of the work force and the rest of society, how are people to buy the commodities that capitalism produces?

266 2018-06-07 01:29:23 @AmyTrask @BSO @stephenasmith Watching the Finals we’re not seeing Anthem protest controversy like in the NFL. Could it be that NBA owner/players respect & need each other for the league to be successful? It appears that the NFL treats players like replaceable commodities?
267 2018-06-07 01:18:15 I agree John.  Kirill Klip is a terrific investor and deal-maker.  He's understood the big picture for commodities longer than almost any investor I know.  His wisdom and experience is a tremendous asset to TNR Gold. 
268 2018-06-07 01:14:42 .@SHSanders @WHitehouse Let me correct your lying ass. Those billions and billions of dollars has gone to the top 1% of the 1%, You clowns have blown up the deficit, all while raising gas prices and commodities prices hurting your own voters most #Idiot
269 2018-06-07 01:13:55 It’s called commodities, free trade... has nothing to do with independence... we buy at the lowest price available. Two different subjects and I don’t think you know what your talking about.
270 2018-06-07 01:06:26 You mean in old Walmart buildings! Make sense...they think of them as commodities not human beings! #WhereAreTheChildren
271 2018-06-07 01:03:06 If it weren't for those pesky laws of physics it'd be a really killer business move. Turn all platforms into commodities overnight.

274 2018-06-07 00:43:55 This isn't true. For all commodities and commercial products, capitalism is inherently better than socialism. But it's my belief that all things fundamental to a person's rights can be provided by the government. If someone wants to buy their own private healthcare I don't mind

277 2018-06-07 00:16:52 Mr Gillam? His fair value stated many times was 30 cps
But he is not a professional on commodities and finance as he recently revealed on Twitter so take the opinion with some measure. My “little” view is STRATEGIC resources get LT vertical integration value + a Premium not-disc%
278 2018-06-07 00:00:39 You still owe taxes on capital gains from commodities trading, so the designation of "not a security" doesn't change that.
