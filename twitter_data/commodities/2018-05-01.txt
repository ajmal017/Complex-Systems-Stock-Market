- a very different thing.
How they must yearn for cobbles, flat caps, ferrets, and a 'pink globe'.
Even Labour say they regard workers as commodities - import/export skills and lift and lay as needed.
2 2018-05-01 23:50:22 The fact that it is hard to define, or to provide guidance for, hints that, perhaps, regulating them like existing securities or commodities is an attempt to fit a constantly-evolving peg into non-conforming holes.

6 2018-05-01 23:38:44 I worked for such a person. Just because you are successful at trading commodities doesn't mean you'll be a genius at creating an Internet start up company.
7 2018-05-01 23:25:59 Problem is we haven't seen deflation in over 80 yrs so most people don't really know what it is. Falling commodity prices was not overall deflation. Commodities in a counter-trend rally now but will go to lower lows during the coming bust as will prices of most goods & services.
8 2018-05-01 23:22:00 I agree to that because my grandfather will tell me stories of how people in power would also exchange essential commodities like grounduts, cotton for just a pack of pencils or mirror.
Laughable.

10 2018-05-01 23:16:58 Sure. They can have their own. When they work for and pay for it like everyone else. If they want to make bank breaking their backs on land they paid for, by all means.
Commodities are not rights. No one has a right to land they didn't work and pay for.

13 2018-05-01 23:10:11 I notice many commdities fall in price over the past 5-10 years, some by over 50%.

In the last 6-12 months, I see prices of many commodities rising. 

I wonder if your deflation call is a bit late.
14 2018-05-01 23:06:12 I've seen it come up more than once in the last week or so that we should ignore the whole incel thing, as that only leads to them getting attention they don't deserve. Or, God help us, suggestions like giving them hookers will stop them from viewing women as commodities.

39 2018-05-01 22:39:22 Does this mean, our data has become public commodities?
40 2018-05-01 22:38:16 And I have always been a warm, kind and understanding client who treated SWs as people not as commodities, and went with the flow of the experience in a manner in which both of us ended up happy, feeling appreciated and connected
41 2018-05-01 22:34:55 The system at a point became such that communities were trading their own in exchange for commodities the Europeans, Arabs, etc had. For the slaves, they had no choice, but the African nation/Black people were complicit in the whole slavery issue. There were 2 sides to it.

43 2018-05-01 22:25:59 Actually stupid to say you can’t trade without a stop (I trade with stops though). There are a lot of markets that can’t go to zero (currencies, commodities, stock indexes etc.) You can exploit this if you have time on your side and backtested long only systems.
44 2018-05-01 22:18:30 I know this is, like, the least wrong thing about it, but the analogy also demonstrates a poor understanding of the difference between services and commodities.
45 2018-05-01 22:16:00 Sermos fornecedores de commodities é o que eles fora querem, inclusive com baixo custo de mão de obra e baixos impostos, por isso esta moda do estado minimo, mas não é o que o PT quer, o PT quer desenvolvimento e soberania.
46 2018-05-01 22:07:26 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
47 2018-05-01 22:03:08 That doesn't preserve the analogy. Unwanted sexual attention isn't free. Women are not commodities.
48 2018-05-01 21:52:35 Yes Chris shift to different agricultural commodities and trend away from smaller country towns happens without any other factors such as water reforms.
49 2018-05-01 21:32:04 Peter a bit off topic, but why do you think that all commodities crashed so hard in 2015?
50 2018-05-01 21:30:08 Lots of nice moves in commodities. Gold and silver suck right now but may change tmrw when Fed mins are released
51 2018-05-01 21:11:25 Papel de commodities tem um momento muito forte. Facilmente se perde. Acho.
52 2018-05-01 21:11:10 If I had to guess, the difference in ideals is that you are generally describing regulated capitalism vs. completely unfettered capitalism in places where people are treated exactly like disposable commodities described in your communist model. Its moral success is not a given
53 2018-05-01 21:10:10 "Thrifty people, they will teach you the importance of depreciating the value of capitalist commodities."
54 2018-05-01 20:51:08 All commodities down  today
55 2018-05-01 20:49:52 Todas as commodities p baixo 
56 2018-05-01 20:48:07 See how we are the first CIA mass mind control group fed information about white supremacy  while we only painted as slaves and nothing more. We still are commodities trading in our labour for financial slavery.

58 2018-05-01 20:31:55 If you legitimately want to be friends with someone and care about them, when they spend time with other people it shouldn’t detract from the time they spend with you. Friendship is beautiful but when you turn people into commodities for personal gain and power it’s not healthy.
59 2018-05-01 20:28:07 It is a huge responsibility to ensure there is enough food for a country once out of the EU. Easy against freely available commodities, an altogether different challenge when global production doesn’t meet demand.
60 2018-05-01 20:21:39 como se o brasil nao fosse O MAIOR PARCEIRO ECONOMICO DA COREIA NA  AMERICA LATINA e um dos maiores importadores de produtos e exportadores  de commodities, metade da carne que eles tanto se gabam de comer vem daqui

64 2018-05-01 20:04:38 I don't know. I don't see a problem, personally, but maybe I'm naive about it. I have read plenty which says that immigrants contribute more than they cost but I don't like that argument bc it makes them sound like commodities
65 2018-05-01 20:00:29 Em tempo. Agro business é commodities, nenhum brasileiro come do que é produzido, pois é exportado. Acampados são poucos, a maioria é de indignados. Agora, qto ao bom dia a cavalo, o pior é alimentar o bueiro pela ignorância ou não querer saber.
66 2018-05-01 20:00:23 Y’all let relationships turn into commodities
67 2018-05-01 19:57:39 Funny I read this morning GS bullish on commodities, when you made that call back in December.
68 2018-05-01 19:56:11 Nice analogy, but one huge difference: stock in warehouses can be ramped up and down with demand prediction quickly, as warehouses are cheap commodities. Gen capacity reacts much slower once out of market as Capex is huge and legal approvals time consuming.
69 2018-05-01 19:50:28 Also there's an inverse relationship between The US$ & Commodities!!!
70 2018-05-01 19:36:16 Commodities are the opium of the people.
71 2018-05-01 19:32:24 Increased price of petrol and diesel leads price rise of all essential commodities. Then how Labour class will survive. Only 2% Labour working in organised sector and all others are highly exploited and no money to survive.
72 2018-05-01 19:23:54 every market is manipulated. stocks, especially during earnings calls, forex, especially during quarterly trade commission revisits, commodities, crypto, etc.

74 2018-05-01 19:13:23 Nice. The great Lester Lave used to make a warehouse analogy for electricity, but to show how different it was from other commodities.  He noted 2 major differences:
1. Production must equal demand at all times.
2. If production drops below demand, then things go really wrong.
75 2018-05-01 19:05:06 It’s my opinion that teams should look at draftable players as commodities. You move up or down to maximize value not because you like a guy. New England is easily the most dispassionate front office in football and also the most successful.  I don’t think that is a coincidence

84 2018-05-01 18:39:59 Admittedly I didn't, but I work in ag and know that regardless of the size of your farm, you are going to earn what the commodity is worth, minus your expenses, and the commodities have been in a much better place for farmers, psychologically speaking.

96 2018-05-01 18:25:41 I despise Trump with every bone of my body but this narrative doesn't quite fit reality. Commodities, the backbone of a farmer's livelihood, have been on an upward trend since last fall after 4 years of over 50% declines.

109 2018-05-01 17:45:53 $BTC may lose a large portion of its value at times by free market forces.

115 2018-05-01 17:10:53 As I understand it much of the wealth derived from capitalism is made when people who create commodities/widgets (workers) are paid less than what these things are worth.

What most of these things are is currencies - and they should run/be free like other fiat currencies.

129 2018-05-01 16:44:32 Broad basket commodities are historically cheap compared to equities.
130 2018-05-01 16:42:40 When they were American made they were great guitars but they moved production to Mexico when NAFTA came 'round. Since then their instruments have been cheap commodities, not labors of love.

133 2018-05-01 16:36:25 Can't be too shocked that posh lounges are getting driven to cheap commodities just like everything else related to air travel.
134 2018-05-01 16:33:27 Okay. I believe that warps societies attitudes towards criminals and turns them into commodities that can be profited off of if they can find a way to imprison them, rather than focusing on rehabilitation which would benefit society more.
135 2018-05-01 16:25:05 No, just commodities this week. 
136 2018-05-01 16:21:40 Trump's saber rattling in the ME will push the commodities market prices up.
137 2018-05-01 16:20:29 For a government that had to be dragged through its own courts to confirm centuries old constitutional law of Parliamentary supremacy, which they continue to deny then logic & democracy are commodities they clearly lack. Of course a #PeoplesVote is logical democracy
138 2018-05-01 16:17:42 It seems like you need a buddy system to be a market maker, 'cause if you don't have a buyer when when you sell your stock, it simply tanks back down. In this way, it's similar to commodities, where it's a zero sum game.
139 2018-05-01 16:13:29 Several Western parliaments, ENVI Ngos, companies & academic institutions call for boycotts, replacement of commodities from Indonesia, arguing that govt is weak, corrupt. This has worsened relationships at different levels. Risk that nature conservation cooperation will suffer
140 2018-05-01 16:10:30 hmm...it seems the demand in some commodities is more due to buy on storage as tariffs kicks in rather than outright pure demand ?

141 2018-05-01 16:09:09 I know you know farming better than I do, but IMO - commodity prices are being manipulated by silos, I think they call em, that act as clearinghouses or agents btwn farmers & commodities brokers priced based on futures. Plus Corp farmers using GMO & SATNAV tractors working 24/7
142 2018-05-01 16:08:25 Exactly, also successful BW have a limited pool of men to choose from. Successful BM know they’re rare commodities so the successful BW ends up having to prove themselves (something they hate doing, but this is what 95% of men have to do)
143 2018-05-01 16:06:44 Over the past 10 years, gold has outperformed all other major asset classes with the exception of U.S. stocks (or the new crypto mining), producing average annual returns of nearly 6%. That's a better return than what "commodities" investing in general produced.

146 2018-05-01 15:57:39 Horses, hounds and livestock are all just commodities. If there is a grant to have them that is all farmers are interested in.
147 2018-05-01 15:56:19 There are certain commodities ground by a small farm that can be marketed at your local farmers market. But most of them are marketed through a corporate structure. There are gins, packing houses, feedlots, etc. Some of these are cooperatives.

Also computed incomes exceeds P400K/annum but less than P800k, on 1997 taxation your total tax is 27% while with TRAIN its 16%. And it'll even go down by 2022. But there are other commodities that were taxed heavily, but to sum it, it is  still lower than before. Pro-poor.
150 2018-05-01 15:49:18 Negli anni '80 l'inflazione è tornata a livello accettabile grazie allo stop all'indicizzazione dei salari e al termine delle tensioni di prezzo sulle commodities. Non esiste valida ragione teorica per dire che le variazioni di M0 sono correlate a inflazione: è M3 ad esserlo
151 2018-05-01 15:44:31 I like it as _we_ interpret it, but it's part of an Iron Age legal framework that is mostly focused on protecting women's modesty and virginity as patriarchal family commodities, so it doesn't make me cheerful. :(
152 2018-05-01 15:44:20 Current account should adjust more quickly than in the past because oil and fuel commodities are low margin and can be refined elsewhere to avoid the us currency.  Tbonds are voluptuous, irresistible at 3-4% driving capital tho
153 2018-05-01 15:42:19 Less than three years into a recovery, commodities are gaining
momentum vs. the decade-long rally in stocks. Favorable demand
vs. supply and a multiyear price decline vs. bottoming

continue to favor commodities. @business

159 2018-05-01 15:33:17 @realDonaldTrump Stock market down, gasoline and consumer prices up, commodities markets nervous due to tariffs. Monthly jobs numbers below last few months of Obama's term. Nice job!
160 2018-05-01 15:31:34 Those are always overriding factors. I get a lot blanket comments on how a stronger $ "hurts" commodities. It can, but blanket assumptions on convention can be wrong. Wilbur Ross made an accurate case on brazilian beans competition re tariffs this morning.
161 2018-05-01 15:29:29 This is fallacious on its face. You do not “turn individuals into commodities” when you profit from commercializing their cultures. You’re thinking of enslavement. I’m Scottish. If a non-Scot wore a kilt to a wedding I would not become a commodity, they kilt would.
162 2018-05-01 15:26:37 Concordo e fico pouco preocupado com a ida aos 4,00 diante das turbulências presentes e vindouras. Problema é a volta aos 3,00 quando tudo ficar calmo e as receitas de commodities prevalecerem na determinação do preço do US$.

172 2018-05-01 14:43:38 Congratulations still essential household commodities like mixer grinder, iron box, immersion heaters are in 28% which should be in 12% as only poor people use them. Remove 28% corruption will reduce and revenue will increase.

PC Jeweller: Multiple block deals were seen in this counter, but two of them stood out for their sheer size. Alphagrep Commodities traded 67.59 lakh shares at Rs 171 apiece. QE Securities traded over 44 lakh shares at Rs 168 apiece.
174 2018-05-01 14:40:16 Even the value of certain commodities is artificial. Yeah we can redistribute all the precious metals in the world, but people will still need to eat food.

176 2018-05-01 14:36:45 A number of South American countries are looking to pick up the slack in terms of trade with China for example. They are looking to substituting the trade gap left by the United States's export annulment to China with their own commodities. This is how we should be thinking.

203 2018-05-01 12:44:36 Are we observing similar correlation convergence in other assets like gold, commodities, JGBs, etc.? If not, I think this concern is misplaced. Treasuries are not the only source of diversification. It’s just the most popular place to seek it.

245 2018-05-01 09:51:06 @narendramodi Respected Sir, we have dispensed with small coins but  this should reflect in MRP of all commodities since no consumer is getting back his due balance (petrol 1 Lt is 71.64 and if I pay 100 rupees,I do not get back 36 paise ). Request you to address this issue.
246 2018-05-01 09:44:18 It's not all about increasing minimum wage, it's about decreasing the cost of living in the country. This new minimum wage might just hike the price of commodities.  You will hear statement like 'shebi dey don increase una salary, why u kon dey complain say tins for market cost'.
247 2018-05-01 09:08:42 Certo... soprattutto nelle commodities... dove l'elasticita comanda...cmq noti la tua parte come padroneggia le regole del dibattito? Pazzesco. Buon a giornata ancora Umberto. Un piacere.

251 2018-05-01 08:52:30 With the hike in prices of commodities 18k is relatively to small to cater for ones need in a month, alot of people living with this salary scale are living under poor conditions, especially those with children, even youth Corpers find it extremely difficult to save.

259 2018-05-01 07:57:26 What facilities should labourers be given?
I think: They should be given
1. due respect / a respectable status in / by society
2. reasonable salary with transparent criteria for annual increase
3. quality / uniform  education to their children
4. subsidised commodities.
260 2018-05-01 07:50:58 There is all round reduction in Prices of all the commodities. Traders calling it as 'Mandi'. But it's not 'Mandi'; It's symptom that country slowly & steadily getting out of 'महंगाई' (inflation). This is the result of GST & demonetization. यानी अच्छे दिन आ गये!!
261 2018-05-01 07:44:02 I never do short term for any of my investments 
The shortest of any of mine is usually 2 years (stocks, bank notes, commodities) 
My mid terms are cryptos (5 years)
And long terms for others 
262 2018-05-01 07:33:10 I think Atwoli should not only push for increase on the minimum wage,  but also push for lowering the cost of living. There's no need of increasing wages and raising the cost of basic commodities such as electricity.  #LabourDay
263 2018-05-01 07:30:08 Dear Modi Sir, India has gained newheights&horizons under your visionary leadership but the bad fortune is that bad phase is not eradicating from the life of Indiansthough prices of "essential commodities like LPG & Petroleum are on rise constantly. May I know why  @narendramodi
264 2018-05-01 07:27:34 Big Boys want to do the Big Short in bonds and push yields and USD ever higher and commodities (currency) lower fast. However, fundamentals don't stack up to do so....
265 2018-05-01 07:20:37 Então tá, vamos falar sério. A extração do nióbio no Brasil foi comprada pela família Moreira Salles, banco Itaú.

283 2018-05-01 05:46:02 @BNNBloomberg please add to the commodities expertise of BNN. More charts, geopolitics, interviews etc. It should be the global leader!
284 2018-05-01 05:43:41 Humility and respect are so much more valuable today because they’ve become such rare commodities.

290 2018-05-01 04:48:19 After visiting Communist China twice my thought process of trade unionism as aviation trade unionist changed
Chinese workers r working without protest and strike 
When I asked some said we have to give commodities to 7 billion fellow people for a cheap price to have happy living
291 2018-05-01 04:40:46 That's so great. :-) Such an authentic, open reaction. 

(And isn't it nuts, that we find ourselves lingering over such things -- which aren't that uncommon, in prior generally. 

I guess it's the very stark contrast, that make these traits seem like scarce commodities? :-\ )
292 2018-05-01 04:24:17 Regulation - you need only look at the demise of the single desk to ascertain position of politicians re regulating commodities
293 2018-05-01 04:14:19 Trade restrictions on Chinese commodities enhance poverty in their respective countries. 
Even for USA to produce small commodities with so less price like China 
Either produce Essential commodities or Aeroplanes
294 2018-05-01 03:51:14 It's Chinese who r providing commodities in a such a cheap price to 7 billion people 
Chinese use and throw and buy a new philosophy will continue to run the factories  so that world pathetic poverty can be mitigated
Don't save 
spend more and more 
for huge currency circulation
295 2018-05-01 03:49:49 Integrity and honesty are rare commodities.

309 2018-05-01 02:20:28 That may be the frame with which you read, but it is not what it says. I didn't specify women vs men, and I didn't talk about bodies or commodities.
310 2018-05-01 02:12:17 So we get smaller government by introducing a tariff that requires tracking different deals with different entities for different commodities used for different purposes?

I thought OPOTUS was all about fewer regulations and less paperwork.
311 2018-05-01 02:11:30 Praise worthy achievement of this Govt is to keep prices of essential commodities under check , Hoarding has become a thing of the past , stock levels are monitored on a realtime basis , price stabilisation fund has helped

312 2018-05-01 02:06:23 Yeah but there are different ways you can base currencies you realize that right? You can have currencies that are based on Commodities you can have fiat currencies you can have currencies that are based on deficits etc. It's not always dependent one one thing.

316 2018-05-01 01:07:19 In early 80s Goldman Sachs bought a much smaller commodities trading firm called J. Aron. Over the next 20+ years J. Aron's scrappier culture prevailed over the old Goldman culture, and the firm's leadership still has a disproportionate number of Aron alums (including the CEO)
317 2018-05-01 01:05:53 He’s correct. There won’t be. Commodities are about to roll over big time.  Dollar index is about to soar.
