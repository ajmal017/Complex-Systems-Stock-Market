1 2019-01-22 23:59:28 Sorry, but you have no clue what you're talking about. To be an assault rifle, they have to have selectable triggers on them. The guy was using bump stocks to make them shoot faster. Ar 10s are semi-automatic like all the others.
2 2019-01-22 23:58:55 Its been a terrible year for stocks anyways.
3 2019-01-22 23:58:55 I’m smoking that weed that drop Tesla stocks by 6%

5 2019-01-22 23:58:33 @INFINITIMotor How sad and unfortunate Infiniti took a turn for the shit.
All they produce now are high-end Hyundai's and high end is a gross overstatement to be nice.
Make a G40H(V8 Hybrid) and watch the brand reignite like Mt.Fuji use to be.
PULLING MY STOCKS TILL THEN.
6 2019-01-22 23:58:12 Why didn’t you come up with the idea then. You would have been rich by now. Our economy is based on consumption. Stop consuming like maniacs and watch stocks plunge. We have the power to do so and prefer to act a victim’s role.
7 2019-01-22 23:57:17 both my mains are now officially elite. we did it fam.

8 2019-01-22 23:57:14 You’ll prolly kill yourself all 3 stocks, Luigi don’t wanna live bruh
9 2019-01-22 23:56:56 I don't care what the charts say, I just won't buy the Chinese stocks. There are too many political risks.
10 2019-01-22 23:55:36 @BenGolliver sad day for your second favourite team of the decade, however Jaren Corp stocks are skyrocketing
11 2019-01-22 23:54:48 I found a mii gunner who only used two moves and used two stocks and tea bagged after every kill. Satan needs to punish the right people
12 2019-01-22 23:53:43 #Stocks,#Indexes ...right to the present remains consistent with MAJOR BEAR MARKET UNDERWAY.
13 2019-01-22 23:52:12 #Stocks,#Indexes Slowing growth in China halts rally. SPX ends day with a poor bottom signal, indicating one of those 1-2 day rallies that may start with a sizable drop. In any case, the multi-week rally will not end without a top signal. The mass of data since the Dec. bottom...
14 2019-01-22 23:52:06 That valuation is not as big of a factor as you think. If you look at the stocks out years valuation it’s cheap. They have multiple streams of revenue and infinite growth potential throughout the world.
15 2019-01-22 23:51:08 If you play QP with 2 stocks I hope your Switch screen cracks.
16 2019-01-22 23:51:00 Hey man, I'm sorry I just don't understand how people can fuck up on buying stocks then complain how it's not their own fault but somehow someone else. It's almost like a child mentality.. If you really bought low you can sell right now and walk away with a 35%return or higher
17 2019-01-22 23:50:57 Beat me to it. I was going to say let's find out her address & march on her place.
