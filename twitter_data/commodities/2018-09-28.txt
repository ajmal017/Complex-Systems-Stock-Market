1 2018-09-30 23:50:33 Eu vejo os dois muito ruins. Isso que me preocupa, o Bolsonaro tem ideias toscas, mas ver o seu programa, suas entrevistas. E o PT tem um plano de governo, Lula só tem essa popularidade, devido boom commodities e isso vai demorar até séculos para ocorrer novamente.
2 2018-09-30 23:24:44 Concordo com você, deveríamos como industria produzir, e exportar nosso produtos industrializado, e não ficar refem dos commodities. Para que isso ocorra precisamos de uma reforma em todos os âmbitos como  educação, mão de obra qualificada e muito mais.

8 2018-09-30 22:25:33 I always open the TV early morning for news the furst thing on tue Sikat Iloilo they talked about was the price increase on LPG, gas, and other commodities starting tomorrow. They said too much tightening of the belt might just cut us in twi. — feeling concerned
9 2018-09-30 22:16:40 I haven’t read the article yet but this will cause the price of nearly everything to rise, as commodities must be transported.
10 2018-09-30 22:12:19 Interested if you have made similar calculations on other commodities?
11 2018-09-30 22:06:26 MIF Sept 2018 was great as per usual. Lots of great conversations, good presentations (newsletter writers, $SCY, $GBR, $FWZ) and a great Friday night out with the boys!  Nice to see the turn out in spite of the low in commodities prices.

13 2018-09-30 21:54:29 Grassley is an idiot. The wealthy put only about 5% of their income back into the economy, whereas poor people put in nearly 100% of their income back in. Buying "booze" and other commodities is better for the economy than dodging taxes and sending money to offshore accounts.
14 2018-09-30 21:48:13 Os dois governos Lula foram o melhor que o país produziu em termos de crescimento, justiça social e inclusão educacional. O governo Dilma teve problemas, mas nunca teria jogado o Brasil nesse buraco sem a crise das commodities e a sabotagem da oposição que deu no golpe.

35 2018-09-30 21:26:41 You are correct how lucky one is to live in the rich countries of the West. But you should be aware the West, especially Anglo Saxon countries accrued much of their wealth from slavery, colonisation with wholesale genocide of natives, and wholesale theft of lands & commodities.
36 2018-09-30 21:21:02 Just learned the history of onion futures manipulation, why onion futures are banned and why onions are excluded from constituting commodities reviewing the Big Coin Case. Thanks @stephendpalley and @Conor0Hanlon for motivating me to dive into that. Onion rings won't be the same.
37 2018-09-30 21:20:09 Yes Puppy Mill bans are great & this is why NYC Mayor signed one in 2017. However homeless #pets aren't commodities like couches 2 be bought and sold, In #LA pet stores don't sell pets they use space weekly for adoptions & pros match adopters with the right #animals #FireRisa
38 2018-09-30 21:18:19 @venezolanoenpie please, make arrangements for an international militar service as a Contract for Venezuela. Don't forget include agreement w TSJ&AN. It will be very easy. It is just an operational command to catch NM+5 more. We'll pay it with knowledge or commodities.
39 2018-09-30 21:11:58 Actually this is a very dumb and dangerous bill Yes ban all sales from Puppy Mills  The NYC Govt passed a law to do this in 2017 Just don't turn homeless pets into commodities like couches like #JustinBrannan's bill does. It creates perverse incentives for the #NYCACC killers
40 2018-09-30 21:07:34 Also noticed you’re new to CT. Did you always trade BTC? Commodities? And how’s CT lol
41 2018-09-30 20:58:51 Ability to trade freely with the other 7billion people on the planet. Re-establish our relationship with the Commonwealth. Not have tax rates dictated to us by the EU. Trade on an even playing field with commodities like Steel. Would be a start
42 2018-09-30 20:47:11 your Excellency Nigerians needs stable price of essential,basic commodities to survive after the minimum wage saga
43 2018-09-30 20:44:03 Much talk about the 'indiepocalypse'... how about discussing how globalization and standardization of game production have turned game making into a commodity market, and game makers - indie or not - into commodities?
44 2018-09-30 20:40:42 Sunday nite opening calls, corn mixed up 1 soybeans mixed up 2 wheat up 1, hangover from Friday’s negative report, corn yields variable. Funds short 113,00o0 contract of corn, 57,000 soybeans,upper Midwest cold /wet next 2 weeks.

49 2018-09-30 20:18:15 Sometimes we have to take a moment to step back and appreciate our lives, and thank fuck we arent living in a situation where we cant get basic commodities.
50 2018-09-30 20:11:07 no es el futuro de latinoamerica, parece un poco exagerado, Brasil ha perdido mucho peso en la arena política latinoamericana de ganar Haddad será un hervidero porque no habrá bonanza de commodities  no querrán hacer reformas,  con el congreso en contra con el STF en contra . . .
51 2018-09-30 20:06:09 When one side hates women and looks at them as commodities to serve their needs, it makes a lot more sense. I am sorry that you had nightmares. I've relived what I went through vividly ever since the hearing. Evil that is obvious like this is hard to stomach.
52 2018-09-30 20:05:11 Unbelievable talent is a commodity that all wish to have, but few possess. Attention to detail, commitment, and a relentless work ethic are commodities that all can possess, but few wish to have. #ThoughtsAt30,000Feet
53 2018-09-30 20:01:10 Ou seja, é possível q o PT mais uma vez surfe o boom de commodities e a população credite ao partido o mérito.
54 2018-09-30 20:00:12 If you want greater profits stop treating your staff as commodities... they are people & not "human resources" disembodied!

56 2018-09-30 19:37:50 Huhuui,  and what options do you have to the common mwananchi???  Let me answer myself... Nothing,  just hiking the prices of commodities.  Today I can't afford to refill my gas cylinder coz of the high living demands
57 2018-09-30 19:37:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
58 2018-09-30 19:30:32 Decorum and restraint are valuable commodities.  Say what you will about whether you agree with @SenSanders,policy agenda, he is thoughtful and measured.
59 2018-09-30 19:30:01 For a good long time endless traders have felt many times that putting trades on #MCX was like a dabba trade, where if you played size you are going to be hit soon and suddenly. Glad @ashishchauhan is producing a credible alternative with launch of @BSEIndia commodities.
60 2018-09-30 19:26:23 As India is celebrating surgical strike anniversary on Pak, everyday as Indians we are suffering more surgical strikes our basic 
commodities.
61 2018-09-30 19:23:18 Ruto said ''Ata mtu ya butchery anaongeza bei ya nyama, kwani Ngombe na kunya mafuta''.

63 2018-09-30 19:22:35 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
64 2018-09-30 19:18:25 you sound like me Jon! some Services up here are now it could be seen as almost bullying Community Advocates now to preserve their stake and market share of folks (as commodities!)
65 2018-09-30 19:17:45 ## But prices of all other essential commodities ( like Dal, Chawal, Gehun, Vegetable Oils, Vegetables, Onion,Chana,Milk etc etc ) are very much under Control.
66 2018-09-30 19:04:52 Commodities now, TREND / TARGET

67 2018-09-30 18:49:53 Yes you do. Your prices are low for commodities (alcohol, many foodstuffs, vehicles). But otherwise you seem to be worse off than Canada as far as QoL is concerned.
68 2018-09-30 18:31:58 my official advice as the world’s top economist: burn all money! trade for commodities except for in my case the village just supports me with food and shelter for being who I am!!!
69 2018-09-30 18:24:48 I doubt it’s only global trade. 

ROI has reduced drastically from different assets in India real estate, commodities flat and common stocks. 

Also, Banking Sector performing bad with regularly new news on NPAs is giving a grime outlook on accountability.
70 2018-09-30 18:18:08 So sorry little fellows   
Humans suck
#AnimalRights sentient beings NOT commodities
71 2018-09-30 18:17:13 BHP Billiton.
Did you know.

Iron ore is their single most important commodity, contributing 39% of EBITDA, followed by Copper at 28%, Coal at 19%, and Petroleum at 14%, with other commodities the balance.

Who knew?
72 2018-09-30 18:13:10 Even the most overtly political works of art can simultaneously, as commodities, participate in the reproduction of the structural inequities they profess to condemn. The author is a producer.
73 2018-09-30 18:05:02 Before mentioning a persons name,this is the best time to address sky rocketng of essential commodities instead of thinking how you will mussle wealth from them.kenya tumerogwa na nani?
74 2018-09-30 18:03:11 @ImranKhanPTI Till yesterday, Asad Umer who was teaching us the theories of Keynesian school of economics, today hiking the prices of every this from commodities to public challas.
75 2018-09-30 17:42:40 high petrol and diseal prices should be controlled immediately and it's the duty of the govt to do so ,I wonder how much the govt is going to lose on its vote share for being so laid back on this as it's having an effect on people now and it's obvious in prices of commodities
76 2018-09-30 17:40:42 Toda atitude honesta é uma expressão da arte. Não existe arte sem emanação, concentração e projeção. Tudo longe disso é commodities - não tem valor. #voiceover
77 2018-09-30 17:40:12 could she really not have known, and can you love someone more than your own dignity that you would be willing to put up with whatever they throw at you or is it all about material gain and commodities, I just don't know anymore...
78 2018-09-30 17:38:15 A tv channel report they have received a video footage in which a car driver can be seen stealing a bikers helmet - Helmets have become hot commodities since police has started cracking down against bikers without helmets.
79 2018-09-30 17:29:39 has anybody noted about how the clothing store mannequin is the perfect metaphor for the ideal Euro/colonial capitalist subject? A blank, white body with no distinguishing features but wrapped in fetishized commodities, serving as a vector to infect others with fetishization
80 2018-09-30 17:27:25 What countries have very large in-ground gold and silver resources? What happens after a deflationary cycle in commodities comes to an end?
81 2018-09-30 17:18:13 I have just seen this and think has the education world gone mad? Do we only see our young people as commodities? ://metro.co.uk/2018/09/27/girl-sat-in-blood-soaked-clothes-after-teacher-said-she-couldnt-go-to-the-toilet-7984731/
82 2018-09-30 17:09:12 they did it to poor whites in Mississippi too,we had to move into the projects and go on commodities {food program} my momma was told that my daddy couldn't live with us or we had to go,you weren't allowed a car either as there were no driveways or parking
83 2018-09-30 17:00:44 How come forced to increase prices of some imported commodities are anti-Hindu though BJP has not given much to upper castes & SC/ST laws are more anti-upper castes & still SC/ST people do not vote BJP because are inclined to hostilities than education. #HinduVirodhiBJP
84 2018-09-30 16:59:36 eu amo meus Primos Ricos Empreendedores (especialmente a parcela que tá no agronegócio) falando que todos os mandatos do PT foram horríveis como se eles não tivessem ficado milionários por causa do boom dos commodities incentivado pelo PT
85 2018-09-30 16:43:47 We’re talking about boys like they’re commodities. Lmao 
86 2018-09-30 16:43:23 Exactly; the black blob is the ONLY RESOURCE for labor & productivity; the green pipes (straws) are the siphons extracting the mined & manufactured commodities, the 1% ball OWNS 95% of the resources & receives 95% of the benefits; the cage protects what is OUTSIDE of the cage.
87 2018-09-30 16:35:48 Why no comments on the metals Lorie in the article. It just talks about technology ,commodities & gold.
88 2018-09-30 16:32:41 some of TV channels busy in Pakistan,Iran,American news views,left nationals intrests Petrolium,essential commodities prices high.
89 2018-09-30 16:20:18 Yep, but bTB is rare in the better cared for pet dog population. Vet care and decent- disease free - food costs cash money,  hunts won’t pay, hounds are commodities.
Hunts contempt for bio security and animal welfare is staggering- I am amazed they get away with  it tbh.
90 2018-09-30 16:13:19 1 Putin's ploys r described in details in Tim Snyder's"the road to unfreedom". Modern Russia is combo of kleptocracy and commodities export hence russian state pwr can't incr nor can russian tech match US or West. Relative pwr however cld be gained by weakening others ...
91 2018-09-30 16:09:56 This altered the whole mode of production & displaced former workers because machinery could turn out better & cheaper commodities. Industry was delivered into the hands of "big capitalists"
92 2018-09-30 16:08:54 Kara is out of her league. Too green (inexperienced) to be in Congress. You don't go from a Comm College Board to US Congress. Doesn't understand agriculture or commodities in an ag state. Doesn't understand economics. Military. Law (but thinks she can write legislation?), etc...
93 2018-09-30 16:07:01 Russias micrcurrency makes dollars and hard commodities desirable for portability of their offshoring and keeping it out of Putins hands if he turns on them on a whim...
94 2018-09-30 15:48:07 Las ganancias de petróleo crudo lideran la mayoría de los commodities
95 2018-09-30 15:44:35 Hay retenciones. Y por supuesto los precios de los commodities siguen referenciados al dolar, eso nunca fue evitado por las retenciones.
96 2018-09-30 15:40:09 Whether the downfall of Jubilee is being plotted or not, is the least of our worries! 

Explain to your 'fellow' hustlers why basic commodities are no longer basic?
97 2018-09-30 15:33:21 Human life is one if the cheapest commodities in RSA. A human being can be killed for a cell phone.
98 2018-09-30 15:28:02 A proposta do Paulo Guedes é impraticável em uma nação com preponderante produção e exportação de commodities com baixa elasticidade-renda da demanda e uma carga tributária historicamente concentradora de renda. Não é pq vc se identifica com o Bolsonaro que vc n pode criticar.
99 2018-09-30 15:26:34 If x has a desire to have sex with y, with x and y from any gender, whether x  orchestrate the events that y has no way out, or things happen just like that, as long as there is no consent involved, it's an attack. For years, men have been taught to treat women as commodities.
100 2018-09-30 15:14:45 Good question. On top of that, it's hard enough with commodities, which are "something" by definition. But wth is the 3rd item on that list? For me, arguing over the value of "crypto" isn't all that far off from  arguing over the value of "digital"
101 2018-09-30 15:13:56 It would definitely pave the way for price hike of all essential commodities.
102 2018-09-30 15:12:21 WE CAN'T BE NUMB TO THIS!  THESE ARE SOMEBODY'S KIDS! AND THEY'RE IN JAIL!  THIRTEEN. THOUSAND. CHILDREN.  ONE WOULD BE TOO MANY.  THESE KIDS ARE COMMODITIES IN THE TRUMP CRIME FAMILY REGIME! NO WONDER POS TRUMP THINKS HE CAN DO ANYTHING HE WANTS. HIS HEROS ARE DICTATORS!

104 2018-09-30 14:59:28 2. When he ordered the military to raid warehouses where imported essential commodities imported & subsided by government of NPN import license hoarded & sold at black market.
I remember how we queued at Ring Road in Benin to get these essential commodities at controlled prices

111 2018-09-30 14:40:49 Hindalco for one , but CRB Index is headed down, metals complex in India may be weak for months, so not the  time to enter now. Generally 2019 may be weak for commodities globally as stock markets go down. Mind you not referring to gold or silver here.
112 2018-09-30 14:33:59 It looks pretty clear cut. Anything other than helping female students to get away from abusive pimps and johns is encouraging 'sex work'. I would never send my daughter to a Uni that sends a message to its students that female bodies are commodities to be bought. It's outrageous
113 2018-09-30 14:10:13 From who??  Nigga you have no idea who that girl has dusted. I'm sure you the type of guy that sees woman as cheap commodities that can easily be picked up by anybody. Smh. Sorry man, you need to wise up. My had lots of richer and finer men coming for her before she follow me.
114 2018-09-30 14:07:55 I wish I had such commodities
115 2018-09-30 14:02:50 Cattle continue to push and are the bright spot of commodities. Cattle closed with small weekly gains, but Sept was a good month for cattle, pushing them to new contract highs and hedgeable levels.

Week: LC: +37.5, FC: +10
Month: LC: +$4.675, FC: +$9.05
Year: LC: +2%, FC: +8%
116 2018-09-30 14:02:42 ‘Freedom of movement’ is conflation of trade commodities with humanity. If it is not, please give your definition.

As for ‘global authority’, competition for supremacy remains ongoing. If history is guide any eventual conquering side is unlikely to be ‘socially responsible’.
117 2018-09-30 13:59:04 Absolutely John, all metals and resources will have their turn, so it is important to be positioned intelligently across the spectrum.Where investors will miss out is chasing the commodities that have already flown. We must invest and stay put LT,  very important.

119 2018-09-30 13:53:37 No one serious argues in favour of humans as commodities, that’s not what is meant by freedom of movement and may I suggesf a willful misrepresentation.  However, whether jobs are taken by immigrants or a much bigger impact, when they are off-shored, the effect us the same...
120 2018-09-30 13:51:43 @PMOIndia Sir, feeling very much sheaky wheather our like middle class people will survive at all in india or not??!! All the prises of marketing commodities are going to exorbitantly high.Fuel prices are scrapping the sky. The existance of common people are facing sufferings.
121 2018-09-30 13:47:02 There's alot of people who just don't value animal life and treat them all as commodities.
122 2018-09-30 13:37:09 Stock piling tins as I write ... plus olive oil, anchovies, French wine etc. These EU food commodities will not be widely available but ... hell, have house in France & will buy whilst I can!

124 2018-09-30 13:24:59 I own a 100 acre cocoa farm Japekrom Ghana. I took 50 acres of cocoa beans to CDH Commodities they are holding 1.8M US Dollars. We have to come up with 6K to open a business acct at Zenith Bank. I have invested all my money into this place since Feb 2018, Can you help us
125 2018-09-30 13:08:30 Totally agree that Woodward is part of the problem.   Gill going when SAF retired left a void at the club.  Clear the decks - write off this season - and give the next manager the most precious of commodities - time. The important thing is that we start to play the United way
126 2018-09-30 13:08:20 lo realmente increible es que alguien defienda un esquema cortoplacista que destruyo lo que eran las mejores condiciones para el crecimiento del siglo, con tipo de cambio real alto, commodities altos y tasas internacionales bajas. se lo fumaron  en solo 8 años!
127 2018-09-30 12:47:17 There is so much more to know about Warren.  How she went up against Bill Clinton’s guys on the Commodities Market Regulatory arm.  She was on to the whole rotten deal and they blocked her.  
She’s smart, compassionate, knows her way around the government (essential skill).
128 2018-09-30 12:44:53 @matthewstoller the "perp" in the financial crisis is former former Secretary of Treasury Bob Rubin. He pushed the "Commodities Modernization Act" through and then left to make $Billions personally at Citi from his creation. He should be behind bars not sitting at one
129 2018-09-30 12:37:05 It's always amusing to see so called critics of Capitalism (eg. Antifa) turn their own bodies into commodities. When you get piercings and tattoos or dye your hair, you aren't rebelling against social norms, you are integrating yourself into capital.
130 2018-09-30 12:34:52 Para los que hablan de commodities. No es sólo commodities. Es el precio que el mercado elige pagar por cualquier bien/servicio. Y como tenemos un mercado abierto (por suerte) el mercado es global no sólo argentino.
131 2018-09-30 12:31:52 Algorithms are commodities.
132 2018-09-30 12:09:02 Commodities def have a higher propensity to mean revert to fundamentals, I agree
133 2018-09-30 12:04:49 Exactly,happy when others die of hunger and stress about the inflation on important commodities
134 2018-09-30 11:55:35 That's awesome! I feel all animals should be free of exploitation and no longer seen as commodities but horses will always have a special place in my heart 
135 2018-09-30 11:55:10 there is I am afraid no such thing as price control in our country. Prices of vegetables & other commodities jumped up
136 2018-09-30 11:51:27 O la carne, el acero, etc. Que alguien le explique el significado de "commodities".
137 2018-09-30 11:47:11 ## Can concept of AMUL Pattern Dairy Cooperative Structure can also be applied for other Perishable Agricultural Commodities like Fruits and Vegetables,so that Unscrupulous Agricultural Traders cum Hoarders can be eliminated from Agricultural Marketing Channel.

139 2018-09-30 11:18:47 And about nourishing India (which is what food is for).  Agriculture that produces too much sugar, tobacco and commodities that don’t support good health is dangerous.  In Bangladesh, supporting nutrition is one of the key goals of their agricultural strategy.
140 2018-09-30 11:18:44 Yes, a global financial crisis left us no choice but to borrow  money and sell commodities (gold) in order to offset the carnage. It's the Tories who have used it to batter the public. We've literally had to pay it back. Tories have doubled borrowing yet we haven't seen a penny.
141 2018-09-30 11:13:20 The indiscriminate rise in prices of essential commodities has left many a people tense and helpless

#MehangaiKaBojh
142 2018-09-30 11:12:34 The prices hike is not much which may effect the commodities

145 2018-09-30 11:06:54 The indirect taxes are on luxury items. Common commodities for non elite citizens are not changed. Please refrain from propaganda news, you are one of few good ones from PMLN.

150 2018-09-30 10:42:27 Do u know in Assam fare of public transport going to raise minimum 40%. Cost of essential commodities & fuel also raising day by day. So poor become poorer. Is it ACCHA DIN.
151 2018-09-30 10:35:10 Hardly consenting if one party has to be paid to do it and wouldn't do it otherwise.
And yes a system of Decrim. which would institutionalise sex buying is indeed a classification of all women as commodities with a price on their bodies ie a system of slavery !

153 2018-09-30 10:30:08 Sometimes I buy generic brands of well known commodities. For example, today instead of paying full price for the power of greyskull, for 40% less I ordered the power of charcoalface.
154 2018-09-30 10:25:57 Gas is not used at home only, my brother. Commodities effect tau hounee hee thee! Just need to understand instead of being misled.
155 2018-09-30 10:20:09 Btw, it was understood that hike in gas prices will increase the price of commodities which will apparently effect everyone. #MehangaiKaBojh
156 2018-09-30 10:18:52 Globalism will continue, but our investment in expensive central bureacracy will cease. Free trade cannot include human beings - they are neither commodities nor appendages to them. In the information age, electronic visas for temporary travel are not difficult to imagine.

158 2018-09-30 10:09:10 Just call it Canada minus minus because we don’t trade commodities,  we trade services and Canada will grow more wealthy as we  grow poorer.
159 2018-09-30 10:01:52 I partially agree but not all minimum wage jobs are unskilled, Care workers, although not to degree level, need qualifications, anyone can be a commodities broker. Two extreme examples but still...
160 2018-09-30 09:54:03 The issue is not about bond notes but RTGS balances. Can RBZ afford to liberalize the markets? What will happen to price of basic commodities? Can RBZ inject more USD! Won't it be swept off banks?
161 2018-09-30 09:49:33 You stated the only way is UP if you're paid minimum wage. That is not true for some, is my point, pay doesn't always reflect that job's value to society. The care worker or binman imho is worth way more to society than the commodities broker. Money does not equate to success.
162 2018-09-30 09:47:16 We need the Leader of this Country to regulate the Government External borrowing  and Importation of Commodities  like maize
163 2018-09-30 09:42:55 Mercado vai subir enquanto as commodities estiverem subindo (INDEPENDENTE DE QUEM VENCER), compare o gráfico do IBovespa com o preço das commodities e verá uma correlação das mais forte que existe.
164 2018-09-30 09:06:47 Fascinating to trace the violent life of these everyday commodities and how Colonialism made them international. Tea leading to the Revolution, Opium to the attack on China and Hong Kong, Cotton to Egypt, Bombay, Civil War and Manchester

179 2018-09-30 07:35:05 No doubt that the salary increase would raise the price of commodities, especially in a country like Nigeria where price control is thing of a past. Allah dai ya kawo mana mafita.
180 2018-09-30 07:34:16 PM @ImranKhanPTI control the prices. Govt don't hike the taxes but cunning merchants hike the prices of the commodities on the name of taxes and make hafty profits. Poor and uninformed people trapped in their fake net of increased tax rates. Urgent action required

191 2018-09-30 06:10:24 The fiscal stimulus has one big goal in mind...that was to drive real investment in the economy (not financial investment in commodities & derivatives) and hence spur job growth to bring unemployment down. Unemployment stayed stubbornly high after the stimulus...because...

206 2018-09-30 04:35:08 A fair point. Farmers still need affordable healthcare and good schools for their children and grandchildren; clean air and water. They need the products, services, and markets that the cities provide. 

How many farmers could survive without bank loans and commodities exchanges?
207 2018-09-30 04:32:43 Who cares? 

You would think a billionaire would know that oil is a global commodity.

China buys less Europe buys more. That’s how commodities work. See Trading Spaces with Eddie Murphy for a simple lesson.

215 2018-09-30 03:43:22 Todo​ o "desenvolvimento da era lula" acompanhou o de 39 países emergentes... Quer dizer, acompanhou não, pq o Brasil só cresceu mais que 4 destes. Ou seja, cresceu muito menos que deveria e foi um crescimento fajuto, não-sustentável, baseado em commodities. Foi o melhor período?
216 2018-09-30 03:43:13 If the President of Kenya is serious with fixing the health sector, he should not allow prices of essential commodities to he overtaxed as taxes on illicit and harmful goods led by TOBACCO remain low. This is like starving and intoxicating Kenyans.
217 2018-09-30 03:41:45 A bonança do consumidor brasileiro veio, sobretudo, do aumento da renda do trabalho. Que por sua vez, capturou dois componentes: de um lado a alta de preço das commodities e a forte entrada de recursos externos, do outro elevação do salário mínimo ACIMA do q suportava a economia
218 2018-09-30 03:37:05 I mean it's okay lang naman magtanim ng gulay sili or kamatis. they don't take up a lot of space but for that to be the remedy for rising cost of basic commodities, common. Hindi lahat may lupa, hindi lahat may time to even manage their personal life.

229 2018-09-30 02:23:09 El PT ya debe ser historia en Brasil, demostraron solo fracasos a excepción del momento en que las commodities les permitieron financiar sus desequilibrados gastos. Hoy lo que hizo Lula en su momento no se puede financiar por lo que Haddad no hará más que destruir la economía.
230 2018-09-30 02:20:22 Jajajajaja vos te pensas que Lula hizo lo que pensaba hacer? El tipo supo aprovechar las commodities y dejar de lado sus planes socialistas con los que pensó la campaña, cosa que acá con Cristina no pasó. No me vengas con que ahora el tipo es un mercadista liberal no marxista.
231 2018-09-30 02:07:56 It is very difficult to provide essential commodities and services at reasonable price level  to the poor, underprivileged and middle class people if the corruption prevails in all the departments of TN Government. Tks for conducting the big Meeting to condemn.

237 2018-09-30 00:52:02 A China crescia mais de 10% ao ano e gerava demanda nas commodities desde os ano 90.Os gov.anteriores não se aproximavam dela.Nossa balança era deficitária,não tínhamos reservas,e a moeda era desvalorizada,o "risco Brasil" era alto,então vivíamos pedindo $ p o FMI,o PT mudou isto
238 2018-09-30 00:43:35 It’s commodities trading. Futures prices drive spot prices or else there’s an arbitrage opportunity. The problem is that the US is going to pump more than the Saudis this year. And 10 to 20 cents at the pump is meaningless on $3 gas. It’s not the 1970s.

240 2018-09-30 00:30:04 Human Capital sounds like you're running a dairy farm or a cattle ranch only with people. People are people. They are not commodities to be bought and sold. Eff that phrase from the bottom of my soul (what's left of one after "being" human capital" for years).
241 2018-09-30 00:07:26 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.

343 2018-09-28 17:08:14 So you didn't notice the whole thing about how Weyland-Yutani was an incredibly unsubtle allegory of every excess of unrestrained capitalism and in particular treating human workers as more disposable than the commodities they are harvesting?

Even before the Xenomorph bit?
344 2018-09-28 17:06:44 Kenyans are being overtaxed with no service delivery

348 2018-09-28 16:53:49 PT1.Comex Rule 589 was created by CME,CFTC,CBOE, the Fed judge today said all cryptos are commodities. This by default would give the CFTC the ability to use the CR589 to freeze the market from buyers and sellers. For Price flucuation/Price shortages.
349 2018-09-28 16:53:27 still looking for a breakout above the May highs in US Interest Rates. I think we could see a rally spark towards 4% that would send bonds tumbling. I also think that scenario would be bullish for both stocks & commodities $TNX $SPX $CRB $USO $GLD

367 2018-09-28 15:47:51 Women are still seen as commodities by the powers that be. This is evinced by the lack of punishment for sexual assault and rape. How are women going to get any respect or justice under the law as long as these “good old boys” hold the reins of power?

409 2018-09-28 13:10:10 Tip of the day #16 - CORRELATION. Just like Equity sectors, commodities & gov bonds, Crypto majors can be highly correlated. Consider your marketwide exposure if trading multiple coins.  If risking 2% capital on 2 trades, a sector move against you could results in a big 4% loss.

419 2018-09-28 12:29:53 Plaintiff responds that "a 'commodity' for purposes of [the CEA definition] is broader than any particular type or brand of that commodity." Thus, Bitcoin is a brand of virtual currency, and My Big Coin is another brand, thus they both are commodities because of Bitcoin futures.
420 2018-09-28 12:15:45 To expand on this: complexity is good, orgs grow by becoming able to handle the complexities of scale. Startups disrupt by solving a complex problem. Bad: accidental complexity, and legacy solutions to previously complex problems that are now solved by commodities.

458 2018-09-28 08:35:24 Funny thing is minimum wage isn't even as much of an issue as to price regulation... salary goes (hopefully) and then price of commodities do the same n we r back to where we were. It's a circle of shame.. regulate prices n legal tender will become valuable

That we were better off before 1980 than now. There was no Corruption, health care was for everyone, basic commodities was fo all

the price of commodities in market is always deteriorating

474 2018-09-28 07:04:17 The criteria to be eligible for a state home is broken, with people losing their eligibility for a state home often not being ready to afford market prices.

475 2018-09-28 07:04:09 #Hodeidah residents reported an exchange rate of YER 700 to the dollar this week, the lowest rate to date. As economic collapse interacts with shortfalls on basic commodities, inflation is leaving more and more Yemenis with no means to pay for food, transport or medicine. 4/5
476 2018-09-28 07:01:42 As food and fuel are diverted by way of the last open route to Sana’a, they are forced to travel greater distances at greater expense to suppliers, contributing to inflated prices for basic commodities that mean more civilians cannot afford food and water. 2/5 #Hodeidah #Yemen

484 2018-09-28 06:12:39 Because culture and social structure has been built for men. Women were commodities, and while we’ve made strides we aren’t done. And much of masculine identity is built on the idea that women OWE us themselves. This is a rabbit hole I could go down but basically we’re fucked
485 2018-09-28 06:03:12 By the way I look at it, if we get a reversal today in #gold, #dollar and #euro, nothing has changed in the big picture. It wouldn't be the first time in the past 4 months we get false one day moves. If the dollar closes below its 10WMA, still green light for #commodities
486 2018-09-28 06:00:12 Still not sure what the biggest takeaway from the #AdulteryLaw SC verdict is. 

a) Women are not commodities owned by men
b) Men alone shall not be punished for extramarital affairs
c) There is nothing illegal about the Gharwali-Baharwali concept introduced to us by Bollywood

491 2018-09-28 05:29:39 Good morning cdes wherever you are. I hope you’re well. It’s surprising why most companies have raised prices for certain commodities.

493 2018-09-28 05:28:10 I think a lot of people are missing the fact that the CFTC brought action against them as well, not just the SEC. CFTC has jurisdiction over commodities, even if none of BitMex’s products are tied to securities.
494 2018-09-28 05:24:29 The government knows their money is worthless and the US is the only one that buys all their exported low cost goods, so better stock up on commodities now.

570 2018-09-29 23:56:25 “Use unknown commodities for ones that’s value is known and has proof backing it up”
571 2018-09-29 23:52:28 No. My body and sex aren’t currency or commodities for anyone or any thing. I get what you are getting at, but no. Plus, I need and deserve the intimacy and connection, especially now.
572 2018-09-29 23:49:04 Ahhh...além do Lula já ter pego o Brasil basicamente no ponto de crescer...plano Real e as commodities da China...Tipo...trocando ele com uma pedra o Brasil tinha crescido do mesmo jeito
573 2018-09-29 23:47:06 Why not supply manage all commodities and professions
574 2018-09-29 23:43:59 I believe it was @TheTedSpread talking about China's demand reduction if swine fever continues to expand. Can't remember if that was in the @MarketToMarket program itself or the online discussion.
575 2018-09-29 23:32:01 @realDonaldTrump what are the views on #Cryptocurrency being listed as #Commodities ? Also will the #USA be at the lead of this new #tech #XRPthestandard
576 2018-09-29 23:25:49 Missed it.  Someone proposed that China can stop buying beans from everyone?
577 2018-09-29 23:22:28 Don't forget to order your seed corn early...
578 2018-09-29 23:22:01 But tbh the politics of most movies involving dogs is quite awful. We’re treated like mere commodities or instruments of production. When will Jacobin give us a platform for discussing this?
579 2018-09-29 23:18:30 A economia em alta de commodities foi no governo Lula, não?
580 2018-09-29 23:16:18 How does it feel to know - as a commodities trader - that you yourself are also, a traded commodity?
581 2018-09-29 23:15:43 I am looking for 1 billion if the crop is as big as it appears.
582 2018-09-29 22:58:28 There is no govt policy or economic manuever that can control the prices of commodities to the extent that those on 18,000 minimum wage salary scale can afford a decent living.
583 2018-09-29 22:44:57 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
584 2018-09-29 22:39:27 Its a buisness, they will look after the money. Wheather thats UEFA looking after the European elite or the SFA or @spfl looking after their 2 biggest commodities, everyone else can be greatfull to be included. Tjats not a go at the Old Firm, mainly a go at the way things are now
585 2018-09-29 22:35:42 Rezando para um novo ciclo positivo das commodities nos salvar, independente de qualquer outra coisa.
586 2018-09-29 22:34:19 67)主婦たちは物価高をこぼしている。　

67)Housewives complain about high prices of commodities.
587 2018-09-29 22:33:50 Actually, farming requires physical work. If you actually knew anything about commodities, subsidies, etc.........you'd know what was going on.
588 2018-09-29 22:31:03 Mira el crecimiento del sistema financiero y las obras de infraestructura en las ciudades. Pensá Asunción en los 70s y hoy.

589 2018-09-29 21:35:41 Perhaps if we called the Canada deal applied to the UK as Canada minus, minus because we trade services not commodities and a Canada deal will  be a pile of negatives not positives.
590 2018-09-29 21:31:42 Any time - thanks for letting me follow.  Mainly I think exports for beans are a bright spot compared to production problems.
591 2018-09-29 21:29:25 Interesting. Thanks for the info.
592 2018-09-29 21:28:34 If it makes the gin at Moscow will be overrun. Overloaded in 17 and acres doubled in 18.
593 2018-09-29 21:26:55 Was curious how many acres cotton gained in Kansas. That's a long-term investment crop.
594 2018-09-29 21:25:01 Cotton was the 2018 move.  Cargill the only buyer for beans doesn’t seem to care if we raise them and herbicide failures don’t help.  Time to move on
595 2018-09-29 21:21:00 Folks getting out of the business? I've been hearing a lot of that in central Kansas.
596 2018-09-29 21:17:24 Plenty of land for sale.
597 2018-09-29 21:17:11 .@fayedsouza: Bishop Franco must be investigated. Every man in the Church who has ever laid a finger on a nun without her consent must be investigated. You can’t treat nuns  like commodities. It doesn’t matter how long ago it happened, come out & talk about it. We will support u
598 2018-09-29 21:16:26 Yes — grass and Sudan will follow
599 2018-09-29 21:13:45 I've been hearing that from your area. More wheat drilled this fall?
600 2018-09-29 21:12:37 Basis and futures are taking beans out of the lineup for us.  Going to something that supports cattle on those irrigated acres
601 2018-09-29 21:07:29 No worries.
602 2018-09-29 21:06:48 Sorry I thought you were talking about the crop not raised at usda.
603 2018-09-29 21:05:03 4460: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
604 2018-09-29 21:03:24 Again, the point was made in the program that it is possible US ending stocks could climb to 900 mb.
605 2018-09-29 21:02:04 As discussed in the program, China actually can stop buying. Was an interesting conversation.
606 2018-09-29 20:59:16 These prices will trim US supply—irrelevant to who is buying.
607 2018-09-29 20:57:00 They can’t stop buying.  That’s all that matters.
608 2018-09-29 20:56:27 Industry guy here. This is a very big deal. There are two equally important commodities produced in Alberta. Oil and natgas. Both are landlocked and subject to a single customer. It’s not one or the other, it’s both. Oil at least is in demand in US. Natgas not so much. Be happy.
609 2018-09-29 20:44:54 What a fine line between legitimate and unlegitimate business. Absurd how certain commodities can't be legally transported to certain countries. Seems as though the only way to quickly build up a successful company with minimal funds is by using the Internet to its full extent.
610 2018-09-29 20:39:26 Keep passing that Kool-Aid around. Others might want some.
611 2018-09-29 20:36:56 Who cares. If they don’t someone else does.
612 2018-09-29 20:13:25 A strong, unfriendly landscaping worker sleeps with an uncertain, weak commodities sales agent.
613 2018-09-29 19:50:33 GOVERNMENTS CONSIST OF GREEDY, SELF-RIGHTEOUS, DELUSIONAL, AMORAL, POWER-MAD, IDIOTIC, HYPOCRITICAL, EGOMANIACAL LIARS THAT BELIEVE THEY’RE ENTITLED TO DICTATE HOW OTHERS LIVE; OWNED BY PEOPLE WHO VIEW US AS CANNON FODDER OR COMMODITIES.
614 2018-09-29 19:50:09 This is vile. Sweet revenge from what? From creating and building all the infrastructures that allow these twats to type crap like that on devices like this? Maybe they would like a nice long, dry spell in the land of a middle-eastern, with hardly any clean water or commodities.
615 2018-09-29 19:43:41 Soon they’ll be commodities
616 2018-09-29 19:22:29 The bond note is actually crippling the economy. People taking advantage from neighboring countries, coming to Zim burn their forex buy commodities cheaper. How do we progress really? The bond note has to go ASAP
617 2018-09-29 19:13:01 Ask zipapa.He will advice well how dynamic in politiko change.I bet next election you will be booted out.Right now kenyans are concerned with sky rocketing of essential commodities but not slay queens who chest thumps.
618 2018-09-29 19:00:04 Idea 649:Interoperable e-consumer commodities controlling micromachined web infrastructures to assess shortcomings of social housing
619 2018-09-29 18:52:54 Didn’t rural farming and mining economies also do pretty well under Obama? We had that whole commodities boom. Coal obviously did not but, I dunno, taconite did pretty well!

621 2018-09-29 18:42:55 Is it a blatantly stupid question? It would be great to have more working class writers, but the reality is that writing, on the whole, requires literacy and leisure. Two commodities significant numbers of working class people don’t have. You also need credibility.
622 2018-09-29 18:40:33 I don't watch college football because I feel gross that these KIDS are exploited and treated like commodities. If they put someone like you in a position of power with the NCAA, change could happen that could bring in more fans.
Also, how annoying are big toe hairs 
623 2018-09-29 18:32:31 Modern consumers are placing a lot more value on experiences over physical items or commodities. When shoppers purchase tangible products (other than groceries), they want those items to either tell a story, fit into their lifestyle, be completely unique, or all of the above.
624 2018-09-29 18:08:13 Lol people love hearing the fact that a man is taking some time off from playing the field to teach himself that women aren't commodities but let your mouth slip that you're also trying to see men in a different light and watch your ass get judged to fuck and back
625 2018-09-29 18:07:12 What was happening with equities around a quarter back is what happening with commodities and currencies right now, especially Crude Oil and INR. Those who are long, will get sorted out by the general equilibrium phenomena.
626 2018-09-29 18:04:57 Why wouldn’t they make light of this?  They view women as commodities to be bought and traded when they are no longer visually appealing.  This IS the good ol boys club that has held sway over our nation since its inception.
627 2018-09-29 18:04:22 F the Commentators calling the Bama game too for their Kelly Bryant input as well it’s soo funny how much they see these kids as commodities instead of people who have decisions to make for their future...Hell ain’t like they getting paid
628 2018-09-29 17:49:56 Also one of the major centers of financial capital, debt speculation, ohhhh and the fact that nearly all manufacturing of commodities by western companies is all done in China. Such socialism.
629 2018-09-29 17:48:23 The current thing I don’t get about football is where are the other Eden Hazards of this world? Why are there no players who are trying to mould themselves into a player of his calibre? Quick, scoring and skilful ball carrying midfielders are the absolute rarest of commodities
630 2018-09-29 17:47:07 Birds of a feather flock together- you and Mubasher sahib with Azaz sahib! While Hamid Mir sahib with Gourmet on a billboard in a busy market where all commodities are for sale!
631 2018-09-29 17:33:09 Just highlighting the concept. But most are clueless. The more research. If we could get more jamaicans to trade cryptocurrency, forex, and other commodities then would be great 
632 2018-09-29 17:31:32 Disagree. The Supreme Court passed the judgement for all bottled beverages and other packaged products citing that the customer does not enter a hotel or a restaurant to make a simple purchase of these commodities.
633 2018-09-29 17:20:08 Cara, com todo respeito, é enaltecer miragens! Nada ocorreu, nem um décimo do dito/prometido. Só fizeram marketing, maquiaram tudo, entregaram pouco e roubaram muito mais! Quase q todo o crescimento foi resultado da exportação de commodities durante o maior crescimento Chinês!

636 2018-09-29 17:11:10 Think we are seeing that dino babers is one of the under valued coaching commodities in college football right now.

640 2018-09-29 16:52:45 The LAGOS-KEBBI partnership deal that birthed the LAKE RICE remains one of the best decisions of both KEBBI and the LAGOS state governments. 

I hope other Nigerian agriculturally powered states could take a clue from this deal with one or two of their hugely farmed commodities.
641 2018-09-29 16:45:39 They use Central PSUs in Core sectors/mining/commodities sectors to efficiently to do so ! Ores from Odisha sold cheap to pvt industries in Guj/Mah/NCR ; made into steel , then finished product & again sold back to Odisha....
642 2018-09-29 16:31:27 I think that's a reasonable position to take, evidence seems to bear out. Also, filter off all the securities/ICO coins. Filter out all the wanna-be commodities with junk consensus algos. I want to see what that coin listing site looks like.
643 2018-09-29 16:27:34 Valorização de commodities, nada mais. Lula não fez nada pela economia, muito pelo contrário, apenas assistencialismo parado que acabou depois quebrando o país.
644 2018-09-29 16:21:49 Capitalism is totally amoral. Upside is freedom and economic expansion (all boats ultimately rise though the yachts might go higher). Downside is everything, including people, are commodities, income disparity & corruption. It needs to be contained within wider moral system.
645 2018-09-29 16:11:45 commodities had a depression (down 80%+) in the mid-teens. Just ask my holdings that reverse split!!

648 2018-09-29 16:09:10 Some people like to hold USD or other currency denominated instruments with alternative returns to the potential market performance of crypto-commodities. Also some people like to trade. It's important to the whole ecosystem that there is a lot of trading.
649 2018-09-29 15:59:04 Well, US added 1 rig & a crude buildup on Wednesday, I can´t see the bullish case. With this irrational exuberant buying in #oil, $wti might hit around $78 & $brent around $88 but after that it will fall down HARD. #OOTT #Commodities #crudeoil #fintwit #CL_F
650 2018-09-29 15:55:29 Who Framed Roger Rabbit is the best movie ever made about how entrepreneurs “invent” things like public infrastructure, which they then destroy to force people to use their privatized commodities.
651 2018-09-29 15:44:20 Basic commodities should never be taxed. This is to keep the poverty level high to retain powerful positions. You cannot have your voters educated if you want to manipulate and steal!!
652 2018-09-29 15:33:05 While the SA govt oks the theft of white farms and the murder of white farmers. Sounds like a failed strategy used by one of SA's now starving neighbours. Meanwhile Soros will make money selling SA corp stock  and commodities "short".
653 2018-09-29 15:30:54 Because banks don’t like to hold commodities, they like liquid.

656 2018-09-29 15:06:15 The act of buying commodities will become less of a chore. Companies like @Amazon & subscription businesses will make this easier through offerings like auto-renewals, one-tap purchases, & same-day delivery, so the routine component of shopping will become more streamlined.
657 2018-09-29 14:59:23 What would the SEC come after bitmex for? What crime? Bitmex doesn't offer securities. Commodities futures are covered by CFTC

659 2018-09-29 14:38:28 Price resistance on higher priced commodities has set but there is still light supplies on many of them creating some discounting from some but not all vendors. With cooler & wet weather due mid week, prices could hold thru most of the period on veggies and berries
660 2018-09-29 14:30:32 O problema da crise é mais por decisões equivocadas que por corrupção propriamente. O Brasil deveria ter apostado mais na industrialização, mas continuou dependente de commodities. Isso foi um erro. Ciro já denunciava esse erro no Governo petista.
661 2018-09-29 14:26:46 As opposed to a “old stanky turkey wrap”?
662 2018-09-29 14:20:59 Almost two months since PTI, GDA, BNP, MQM came to power. Instead of discussing the foreign policy fiascos, U-Turns, rise in prices of commodities and utilities, inflation, vulgar and non serious attitude of the media and sheer hypocrisy, we are being told to blame PPP and PMLN.
663 2018-09-29 14:15:34 Se você quer a prosperidade dos tempos do Lula, vote no Haddad, torça para ele assumir e para que o preço das commodities dispare novamente.
664 2018-09-29 14:12:21 Tal cual, país productor de commodities, considerar que se exporta cobre y después lo compramos manufacturado al triple del precio
665 2018-09-29 14:05:21 Are MCX and NSE gonna announce their merge before NSE commodities get launched?
 @NSEIndia
666 2018-09-29 14:03:33 Pakistan export can go to 50$Bn if govt focus on value added sectors of commodities instead of always beggars of Basic textiles

667 2018-09-29 13:46:05 A big massive To all those who say farmers don’t give a hoot about their animals and treat them like commodities.
668 2018-09-29 13:42:49 ¿Eso significa tener una sola mirada para los negocios? La mezcla de todas las maneras de hacer negocios es la clave, una muy importante es dejar de vender commodities,darle valor agregado a nuestras materias primas,eso significa hacer empresas,mano de obra calificada!
669 2018-09-29 13:24:09 Manure is one of the most valuable commodities my farm produces.
670 2018-09-29 13:23:33 Fallaron dos campañas en el campo, primero inundación y después sequía. Es simple no entraron los dólares por los commodities ergo no hay guita para mantener a la vagancia que vive del Estado. Planes, poder Legislativo etc.
671 2018-09-29 13:20:43 I don’t understand your point.  Nobody is restricted from buying publicly traded securities or commodities.  Do you know what accreditation allows you to do?  But private placements.
672 2018-09-29 13:20:12 What would our percentage be if the consumer subsidies for dairy and other SM commodities were excluded from this estimate?
673 2018-09-29 13:19:12 com que premissa more? manter o país desindustrializado e dependente de commodities como lula abusou desenfreadamente é  o quevou o brasil a lama
não precisou nem de uma redução de 2% no pib chinês pra causar todo esse estrago aqui
674 2018-09-29 13:14:39 Petrol has crossed 90

Diesel has crossed 80's

The prices of essential commodities have risen to the Ganga

However, inflation is in the process of #modi ji compared to 2014

# Modiji did not get scared by memory?
675 2018-09-29 13:14:14 No. Rationalisation - too many overlapping ex R&D in commodities like palm oil, coco, rubber etc (billions). Not to mentioned ovellapping function  & tens billions in housing & transportation. #valueformoney
676 2018-09-29 13:14:04 Wonder how this is done. #Cotton is off 23% from market high. If it’s from Jan 1, that makes no sense for most #agriculture #commodities. Strange.
677 2018-09-29 12:55:14 Would we get to hear the announcement for merger of  NSE and MCX,  before the launch of NSE commodities?
It might be a good news for NSE shareholders.

@NSEIndia
678 2018-09-29 12:40:06 We live in a country where basic social services such as healthcare and education have been turned into commodities. This system favors those born into privilege. We must outgrow the idea that we are stuck in this unfair system. By acting collectively, we can change it.
679 2018-09-29 12:37:25 Me thinks you have a great ghost writer on this one!  But love the link to some recipes using Cdn grown agr commodities thx to @CropLifeCanada & Cdn Dieticians
680 2018-09-29 12:36:18 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
681 2018-09-29 12:31:20 Apart from the constitutional crisis, diplomatic humiliation, economic depression, and even the potential of a shortfall in basic commodities.
Not much really.
682 2018-09-29 12:26:15 boss's and to my Dad's boss with a railroad, CSX, and John Breaux/Edwin Edwards reference to LA. So someone is facetiously using trader and political operative references at the same time with commodities to hide their identities. A lot of William Winter is in these references
683 2018-09-29 12:25:45 Yung ang pinipilit na solusyon sa tumataas na presyo ng primary commodities ay:
• Wag ka na mag rice. Papayat ka pa.
• Wag ka na mag kotse. Luxury lang yan.
• Magtanim ka nalang ng sarili mong sili para di magastos.
San yung solutions dyan on a national level? Ang tanga lang?
684 2018-09-29 12:25:43 Where is the increase in the price of essential commodities?inspite of increase in petrol desiel prices prices of essential commodities came down.But Lutera ghotalabaj commission khor don't see this bcoz they are born lier.Huge dept created by murkh congressi on petrol now repaid
685 2018-09-29 12:24:17 Commodities are by definition fungible...perhaps choices of production crops need to be made.
686 2018-09-29 12:17:46 Imported commodities are bought at globally benchmarked prices. Govt paid subsidies of +Rs 1 lakh Cr pa to OMCs that ended up with OPEC nations. Subsidies are sourced from Taxpayers' money. FM Pranab Mukherjee gave freedom to OMCs to price fossil fuels. Commies don't know this?
687 2018-09-29 12:08:33 We might see same correlation Commodities vs Stock market , as 10 y ago. While i do not disagree #sp500 Will crash, but as per my analysis we are just entering wave 5 , but it can easily end already this fall
688 2018-09-29 12:07:07 And legal fees....

If this works I'll be charged with commodities price manipulation 
689 2018-09-29 12:01:59 Q9: 1Government should spend more on commodities to increase access. 2 More education and advocacy to dispel the myths and bream the barriers. 3. More male involvement. 4. Women should be empowered both intellectually and economically
690 2018-09-29 11:45:18 "Referral systems turns patients into commodities". #americangreed
691 2018-09-29 11:32:55 Don’t trust surveys. Day to day, lived experiences will tell us what’s really happening in our country. Rising prices of commodities, horrendous traffic, worsening economic woes, to name a few, are the true measure whether this govt is doing a good job, or not.
692 2018-09-29 11:27:18 I think Govt is really concerned abt pollution & wants ppl 2get healthy by cycling or walking.This will help citizens to reduce d hospital bill n have longer life. Fuel price increase the cost of all commodities including food & ppl will start diet plans too,for a healthy 2morrow
693 2018-09-29 11:20:07 Cricket-ical thinker has ant kingdom imagination. He is interested with pests and insects thus the fixation with duterte. Never mind the increasing prices of all commodities or the EjkS his fave insect confirmed to be its only sin. 

Keep him talking so i can laugh more. 
694 2018-09-29 11:16:52 Please mention the prizes of Rice, Dal, etc also so that we can have an idea of those commodities also.
695 2018-09-29 11:15:28 A fair economy would be based on labour costs only. The commodities are free (from God, Allah, Mother Earth...)and profit doesn't fit in a fair economy. You should be rewarded as much you put in. Everyone in community helps determine who gets paid what. Transperency! Evolving?!
696 2018-09-29 11:13:08 that's cuz y'all don't understand the beauty of making human beings into commodities!
697 2018-09-29 11:01:49 They are precious commodities only stored in locked safes I believe.

699 2018-09-29 10:50:01 Are you really in right frame of mind? Of course but the prices have gone for most basic  commodities.
700 2018-09-29 10:49:14 @PMOIndia @NITIAayog @sureshpprabhu @dgftindia New has flashed on commodities control just now that few people have imported tur and urad beyond quantitative restriction on the basis of recent madras high court decision of peas, that such restrictions also need govt approval
701 2018-09-29 10:45:32 Och jag antar också att man inte kommer döda hela metal commodities marknaden utan göra ngn typ av OPEC, eller som man gjorde med jordbrulet i europa i början på 90-talet m produktionstak.
702 2018-09-29 10:44:40 Praying that just ONCE  the chauvinistic system of treating women as commodities is not going to be the case here.. Showing bias to the accused puts you in a poor light... 
703 2018-09-29 10:40:57 Implementing the price control means creating job opportunities. A new parastatal should be created to that effect. Price control offices should be open throughout the 36 states, where the staffs will be engaging seriously in field work, resisting price increase of commodities
704 2018-09-29 10:30:57 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
705 2018-09-29 10:24:23 PakArmy's PM says Pakistan is in financial troubles so in addition 2 bear increment in prices of essential commodities like gas, electricity n petroleum products, d nation have 2 adapt frugality 2.But Pak Army is being given contract of $ 180 Billion 4 constructing 5Lakh homes?!
706 2018-09-29 10:23:19 and Pork, Beef, Grains & a dozen other commodities.

Empty threats are all westminster have
707 2018-09-29 10:18:17 Napo, você é Petista... O Brasil 'melhorou' até 2010 porque surfou na onda dos commodities, nada além disso! Não temos indústria, não produzimos tecnologia, não temos avanço e o Populismo Socialista destruiu o país! Tivemos um enorme desgoverno de 2002 a 2018! Hora de mudar!
708 2018-09-29 09:53:26 Will you keep your money in euros when USD declines? Then will you buy commodities and more gold?
709 2018-09-29 09:50:53 Im not oppose to the increase of our minimum wage( it is ridiculously too small tbh),but again we shld be ready for its consequences..basic commodities will bcome ridiculously expensive as well
710 2018-09-29 09:46:26 What after the salary increment result to high price of commodities,  "N500 Loaf of bread  become N1200". Am beginning to think otherwise regards to new minimum wages. Economists your take.

711 2018-09-29 09:38:47 ## Lekin baaki Sab essential commodities ka kimat to mahanga nahi hua hai.
712 2018-09-29 09:26:08 Fuel Prices keeps increasing but commodities cost under control is the argument :) So what why not Fuel as well is my Question??
713 2018-09-29 09:24:04 There's all sorts of interesting material from the COT data. 

If you're trading FX / commodities whatnot, you should definitely check it out. 

Commitments of Traders (COT) data is released each Friday at 3:30pm ET, to reflect the commitments of traders on the prior Tuesday.
714 2018-09-29 09:22:36 @Asad_Umar do you know that shopkeepers have increased the prices of commodities government is not getting anything into it's exchequer yet people are suffering have a heart and crackdown on these shopkeeper goons. It is your duty to ensure that commodities are sold retail prices
715 2018-09-29 09:18:02 @ImranKhanPTI @Asad_Umar @KlasraRauf OK it is agreed that government had to implement new taxes and prices of commodities had to rise. But why shopkeepers have increased the prices since the day if Asad's speech in NA, when notification for price hike is yet to be promulgated.
716 2018-09-29 09:16:14 I lost it when I saw a DDS suggesting that we plant our own vegetables to counter the rising cost of food and basic commodities because that’s what a good citizen is daw instead of rambling on and on about how much we despise Duterte. Unbelievable.
717 2018-09-29 09:15:37 Mark Rich founded one of the biggest thief of Africa's commodity.  Mark was a known criminal. Till date Glencore still trade commodities mined from Africa in Switzerland, no dime comes to Africa, no taxes being paid. This is nonsense.
718 2018-09-29 09:12:06 6.  Development is more than GDP growth. It is more than producing commodities and accumulating. #NationBuilding @Austine_Inspire
719 2018-09-29 09:01:16 #China exports commodities valued at US $200 bil to USA while the latter exports a paltry US $ 6 bil. If @realDonaldTrump calls this trade deficit, what does Africa call theirs?? @_AfricanUnion @BlueBizAfrica @cgtnafrica @Afroforumsa @afroworldview @AfDB_Group

722 2018-09-29 08:51:51 @Super_Crypto they SEC failed chargea bcoz theae guys were dealing commodities and crypto without kyc and shit
723 2018-09-29 08:50:20 All commodities will rip when the dollar falls. But that will be after QT and rate rises end. I think there needs to be a market crash for that to happen. Oil is the odd one out currently. Defying gravity
724 2018-09-29 08:41:09 It's funny how Zimbabwe has become the country with the cheapest commodities in Africa because of the us dollar rates 1us @ 120%. Milk costing $1.40 a litre in a supermarket can be bought by someone for the Zambian market at 80c and a profit of 60c.
725 2018-09-29 08:40:33 It's like Zambian's and others regionally changing dollars at 120% and buying up all our commodities including sugar, drinks etc. it's a mess. No end in sight. Brace yourself for the imminent shortages and queues I predict end of next week, the rate will hit a paltry 200-220%
726 2018-09-29 08:29:47 Point is #Deutschland #Germans investing USD BILLIONS in #DRC not #Mali or similarly. 

Change of #geo #politics & #foreign #interests for DRC vast #commodities etc
727 2018-09-29 08:27:59 We can implement policies that tightens the pockets of the masses,  shoot prices of commodities and services up to raise revenue but we cannot increase their minimum wage yet we are a government of the masses.  The masses love us.
728 2018-09-29 08:05:46 I hope we realize that the exchange rate distortions are fundamental. Fuel guys from the region are now using Zim as a source of fuel, that’s why our fuel requirements have gone up by 24% year on year when the economy is at 0.8%. The fuel sector has crowded out food commodities.
729 2018-09-29 07:48:38 And some resources are commodities...
730 2018-09-29 07:48:20 Sanctions were the reason for Zimbabwe' economic collapse. Their currency was hammered because of sanctions. And that had adverse impact on all their commodities and trading capability. That is what crippled Zimbabwean economy.

734 2018-09-29 07:22:33 On inflation, since the last upward review of the minimum wage in 2011, the price of commodities have gone up significantly, even without any minimum wage review. For their sake and to keep that class of Nigerians alive, we may all need to bite that bullet.
735 2018-09-29 07:21:02 Rising of essential commodities price is Modiism.
736 2018-09-29 07:03:51 PTI is merely 35-40 days in power with tough oppositions of rivals and tricky media's is doing well.Only problem is some members hurridly decisions & aggressive approaches make re-treats on issues.Among r tax & essential commodities price hike.Priority be given for New Provinces.
737 2018-09-29 06:54:53 Drugs make you a slave to capitalism and an enemy of the community sober up, get rid of these filthy commodities.
738 2018-09-29 06:53:17 The diff is that lottery tickets are known to be badically scams, though with stocks and commodities ppl think they are better because it is a real company. They don’t understand markets and call 10minutes on a WSJ article about it learning

741 2018-09-29 06:15:08 And this is why Britain may never recover from Brexit. Chopped up, desicated and devoid if state assets and control over its own commodities and tax receipts, its best young minds leaving, it won't have anything of note remaining to rebuild with.
742 2018-09-29 05:59:26 I am taking as a template for the end of March 2019 what happened in 2000 with the fuel protests. Only took a couple of days for basic commodities to be unavailable in shops. Panic buying happened almost overnight.

Even the rumour a few months later of a repeat did same thing /2
743 2018-09-29 05:54:02 Mr usman dar sahab! "i have a very simple question? when ll' get relief to pak nation in pti govt the nation get more burden due to extra taxes and increase prices of commodities" is it the Madina Riasat!which were promised by our honourable imran khan before election shame.

747 2018-09-29 05:39:24 Karma is real the blunder is working against them, 
how do you increase taxes on basic commodities so that you can repay Chinese loans?
748 2018-09-29 05:37:01 depois que esses preços baixaram. Aí juntou com os escândalos de corrupção, a figura política da dilma, assim como é o haddad, bem fraca. Só que não adianta, mexeu no bolso, não tem popularidade q resista, o Brasil com o PT ñ conseguiu driblar a queda do preço de commodities
749 2018-09-29 04:34:48 Ladies?  Use and throw commodities ...
750 2018-09-29 04:27:01 Hey if some geek tries to shame you into fetishizing commodities you always have two options:

1. Don’t

2. Stab them with their own fake katana
751 2018-09-29 04:25:01 I would but it's not really my wheelhouse, I do know commodities to an extent, dealing in FX, but I wouldn't try to call Crude
752 2018-09-29 04:24:39 Today Indian People r suffering due to high Rate of Petrol~Diesel & Other Commodities but our Government/Opposition parties r Busy in *Parakram Parv Function & Blaming each other due to Rafel deal on Tweeter** they don't want to help here & wasting time..Pls come together Now.
753 2018-09-29 04:02:50 Africa has been raped and plundered forever by fiercely corrupt leadership. There are a lot of commodities,  resources in that land to offer a better way to there populations, should it be managed honorably and not taken over by international corporations.
754 2018-09-29 04:01:15 Where should I start? The Commodities and Futures Modernization Act?
755 2018-09-29 04:01:12 As Nitish has joined BJP and has shut his eyes on deadly price rise of cooking gas, petrol, diesel, Rail fare, all commodities, people has decided firmly to vote Congress Rahul. This may benefit Tejaswi and RJD.
756 2018-09-29 04:01:11 I'm just saying there's a reason pitchers have become some of the most overpaid and hottest commodities in baseball, from SP even to RP getting lucrative deals and headlining blockbuster trades.
757 2018-09-29 03:53:36 India will never forgive #BJP again... They have attacked on the basic commodities of people ..   I hope the educated ones should vote NOTA in next election so that we get some quality leaders in future
758 2018-09-29 03:49:54 Commodities compete. Champions dominate.  It's the DIFFERENCE that counts. Be that. Be different. Be a champion.
759 2018-09-29 03:48:38 Anti non-car travel clickbait articles are a recent phenomenon, caused by falling newspaper sales and a consequent drop in ad revenue from many commodities.
Car sales print advertising is still profitable for the commercial media, hence why they publish a weekly motoring liftout.

761 2018-09-29 03:37:28 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
762 2018-09-29 03:32:32 Que bom ver que o PDT faz o dever de casa conversando com O MAIOR PARCEIRO COMERCIAL DO BRASIL! Afinal de contas, o próprio Ciro tem como projeto acabar com o colonialismo de commodities que o Brasil sofre e melhorar essa balança desigual para o nosso lado. É estratégico e óbvio.
763 2018-09-29 03:31:58 Again, sellers have to sell en masse just like in 2000 and go into 0.6% bunds? Collapsing Italian 10Ys? TSYs at 3% coupon? Overpriced housing after SALT reform? Commodities that are collapsing? EM disaster credit and equities?

I think not.

765 2018-09-29 02:57:43 Well so far 2 out of 3 of my main investment themes have worked out ok. I.e oil & Japan Inc. Not working out well however is soft commodities so I'd like everyone to eat more soybeans, corn, bread & use plenty of sugar :)
766 2018-09-29 02:57:22 When  we will come out of all this $**t n do actually what is needful for a common man... jab Pet bhara hoga tabhi  toh  $*x Karega....  With the rise of fuel all commodities prise has shot up.. business job r down ...
767 2018-09-29 02:53:23 I will never understand people who can live in a house/apartment that has zero phone reception. Being able to make/receive a call at any time just seems so essential to me as most other living commodities.
768 2018-09-29 02:52:13 I’m not sure commodities should be combined for rebates either. Each commodity on its own merit, combined with tonnes delivered & quality.
769 2018-09-29 02:52:01 There will always be cartel be it direct or indirect for any assets, commodities, even stocks.
770 2018-09-29 02:46:05 I’m probably more on the freight rebates than M&T. If you wanted to divvy up M&T rebate where profits came from then one year you might get $10/t canola and $0 on barley and next year -$3 canola and $5 barley (just an example). So average across commodities is probably better
771 2018-09-29 02:29:22 Bollywood DOES treat women as commodities.
What are ITEM numbers?
See the current song lyrics.
Tandoori chicken anyone?
772 2018-09-29 02:19:02 What about uncontrolled price hike of Petrol Diesel ??  What about price rise of essential commodities ?? Are these  in favour of Poor people ??
773 2018-09-29 02:08:50 The prices of basic commodities, rents and utilities will skyrocket, making th net effect zero or even negative, the low incomes still suffer

776 2018-09-29 01:55:10 A Macri le tocó un país destruido por 12 años de socialismo, donde, al igual que Venezuela, tuvieron la mayor bonanza de commodities en su historia. ¿Pero qué pasó? La derrocharon en corrupción y subsidios insostenibles a largo plazo.
777 2018-09-29 01:39:50 You demonstrate great courage and integrity. Rate commodities on all sides these days. I’d be proud to vote for you whenever & wherever you ran. God bless you.
778 2018-09-29 01:25:17 I mean, it looks terrible, but I don't know the context.  Usually politicians wear that because it's a gift.  I doubt this is a pic from a Halloween costume party, and has little to do with turning traditional garbage into commodities.
779 2018-09-29 01:17:21 Congrats sir. If you can be kind enough to share which commodities to track and what’s the best suited time when movement happens, because MCX is open all day.
780 2018-09-29 01:12:44 Sure they can fund again to fraudsters & politicos mafia and get them written off as bad debts. 

Chokidar saab will recover this money from public by raising taxes on some essential commodities Nd recover the money back.
