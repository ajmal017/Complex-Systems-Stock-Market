34 2018-02-21 22:09:09 When Bitcoin acts as a commodity rather than a currency you should expect the market to treat it as such. Economic Activity is the key to Bitcoin success, not speculation. Commodities don't trade multiples above the cost of production for very long, when they do it's a bubble.

How do you square this with a country like the US where guns, predictably like all commodities, are centralized into the hands of white settlers? Or that the 2A exists in the first place to create white terrorist militias?

86 2018-02-21 18:30:19 Are you saying 1% VAT increase..translating to R1 deduction for every R100 spent will cause shockwaves??? Remember that many basic commodities are on 0% VAT. I guess its your analysis that will cause shockwaves.

103 2018-02-21 16:58:08 Nope. I’m familiar with our courthouses and Other government buildings. We even have armed guards protecting spoiled, overpaid precious commodities who play games for a living. Want to stop people from shooting in gun free zones? BAN gun free zones.

111 2018-02-21 16:08:51 the processing for commodities is homogenization whereas the processing for TVs is heterogenization- all quantities of a commodity class should be fungible
112 2018-02-21 16:04:53 It's mind blowing how many things in this world are commodities made from an industry without us realizing. The fact that people enjoy making money off of public humiliation is beyond me. Are people actually that cruel, or are they just extremely desperate? #soc239
113 2018-02-21 15:52:46 (Last tweet didn't load, let me try again). If i own land with minerals, commodities on it,  then i own those commodities and can sell them. That's part of us not being Socialist in that aspect: property rights. Land of the free. I'm free to sell what's mine.
114 2018-02-21 15:52:36 The food industry is going to incorporate animal products regardless of whether or not humanity has efficient methods to survive without them. There are already several vestigial commodities that we keep in our infrastructure in lieu of our society not wanting change.

116 2018-02-21 15:50:40 most of the traded commodities are further used in industrial processes to create other useful consumer items. it's essentially- price discovery of the raw material. can we similarly discover the price of flatscreen, by making people bid on them. idk, but I lean towards unlikely.

118 2018-02-21 15:47:00 These western nations treat white better than asian communities. We, asians, are given PR or Green card just to fulfil the labor requirements and nothing else. We have no value and we are treated as commodities,with the intention of using them and dispose them of.
119 2018-02-21 15:46:13 Here's a weird thought: everything that is traded as "commodities" has usually undergone some processing (e.g. refined oil)
As we perfect consumer durables of all kinds, could things like flatscreen TVs (or, more convincingly, OLED displays) actually be traded as commodities?

233 2018-02-21 04:47:18 @seanhannity Remind the liberals that we banned commodities (alcohol / drugs) and these "solutions" were a great failure. We need to direct our efforts to uncover the mentally disturbed. HYPAA needs to be reviewed.

242 2018-02-21 03:39:43 Devagar aí! Tem muito desvalorização das commodities nisso. Não por acaso RJ e MG são os dois estados que mais dependem das receitas do petróleo e do minério, respectivamente.

249 2018-02-21 02:46:13 A Border Tax exempting some commodities would be the best route to go.  The additional taxes could be used to reduce other taxes such as income and sales tax.  This would then give an incentive to invest in the US producing more good jobs.  Of all people Ryan had a good plan.
250 2018-02-21 02:36:23 Tariffs have always worked, America's Industrial Growth was based on Tariffs.  Usually you want to let commodities like Lumber in tariff free and then heavily tariff manufactured goods.  On the other hand US Lumber Investment and Job Growth is going through the roof which is good
251 2018-02-21 02:33:01 I still think we might get everyone to buy into a grain pipeline with “pigs “ to separate commodities.   No environmental issues. Use lots of hydro to pump.   It’s a win win win.  Let’s get it done.  #cpcnyousuck

260 2018-02-21 01:36:33 Now when a country or bloc of countries imports or exports goods and commodities it may choose to impose a tariff. And there are a number of reasons why it might choose to do so and they don't all involve protecting a native industry or farmers.

268 2018-02-21 00:42:19 Buena acotación, pero creo que estás defendiendo un punto indefendible. Hasta diría que te estay apegando a un tecnicismo argumentativo. Es verdad que *no implica*, pero el sentido común dice que sí (y los analistas, y los precios de los commodities, etc.). Se viene duro
269 2018-02-21 00:38:16 Cambiaron el discurso de “crypto moneda” a “crypto activo” respaldado. Al final están vendiendo commodities a largo plazo. Deuda. Pura y dura.

274 2018-02-21 00:22:02 Commodities: WTI, Cooper, Gold, and the dollar rebounded a bit, and are ranging at year highs. Very sensitive level. 

I think employment numbers next month will dictate if inflation may become a problem or not. The Dow already showed it’s hand.
