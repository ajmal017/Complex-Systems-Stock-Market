5 2018-03-19 23:55:16 Maybe you should sell off your pharmaceutical stocks ? Oh that’s right you didn’t declare anything- you and the Mar-a-lago crowd is getting rich selling opioids to the less fortunate!!

10 2018-03-19 23:53:04 Your calculation omits that some of the large cities had maxed out their housing stocks. If we look at METRO AREAS (including suburbs), in 1960, 31% lived in one of the 20 largest, and by 2010, that was up to 37%. Rural areas have been losing population for a very long time.

59 2018-03-19 23:33:04 Yes, they managed fish stocks, even though they made fishermen throw dead fish they caught back if they were the wrong species (a terrible waste). But with no incentive to preserve stocks long term, why should they preserve stocks?
60 2018-03-19 23:32:42 Republicans need a back bone & say "alcohol has destroyed MANY families, killed many & creates bums" If libs want gun laws like banning certain guns, we should say "ok BUT we will ban hard liquor then" we should go there! Ban alcohol if they ban guns or bump stocks & parts

62 2018-03-19 23:31:30 Bump stocks could be made a NFA item and it wouldn’t hurt my feelings. Just a gimmick and a wast of ammo in my opinion. Now Automatic weapons aka “assault rifles” are already a NFA item.

110 2018-03-19 23:09:11 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. 131
111 2018-03-19 23:09:11 US money supply growth continues to languish at 3.5% annualized, well down on previous years growth. This seriously undercuts the sustainability of capital markets. Overnight slump in US stocks suggests we are moving down to the 21k-22.5k level on the DJIA. #economics #stocks

136 2018-03-19 22:56:38 Did you read the Page you attached? It’s exactly what the Majority of Americans are asking for. There’s no miss-characterization or Lies. It’s very straightforward. Ban Assault Weapons AK & AR & no Bump Stocks & Stronger Background Checks. That’s it.
137 2018-03-19 22:56:38 My only question is ‘Who saw this tweet and felt that they needed like it?’ It’s f*cking stocks!

139 2018-03-19 22:55:44 Morning all
Uber found out overnight that building a driverless car has real life consequences. Lucky (for them) they are privately owned with tech stocks on the nose overnight. RIP to the deceased.
Trade well.

151 2018-03-19 22:49:52 winning in smash is not about racking percent, it's about taking stocks. Rage is literally fine. it's your own fault for not sealing out a stock if you get rage janked.

156 2018-03-19 22:46:04 Whereas post YES its a growth industry ripe for state investment , and double the seats at the EU table to protect it and the stocks via membership - or watch it die without access to its biggest market.
157 2018-03-19 22:45:32 Didn't the EU say they might tax Tech stocks at 3%, because they're running out of money for their Welfare agenda? @GaryKaltbaum

159 2018-03-19 22:44:52 That’s a very sage way of using process of elimination for separating total garbage pumps from good plays. 

Pumpers get higher commission for promoting garbage stocks and e.g., their sales pitch is;

“I am bidding for 500K shares of $SX at 0.40 in the morning” when SP is 0.36 
160 2018-03-19 22:44:28 That is also how stocks work I think

176 2018-03-19 22:36:40 The gun fetishes can protect just the same without bump stocks, noise suppressors and AR15s.  Common sense gun laws do not affect a persons ability to own a weapon.

178 2018-03-19 22:36:03 zuckerberg should lose his billions in stocks when he cant control his own company
179 2018-03-19 22:35:03 Why would you avoid stocks with wide price swings when prices are low?
180 2018-03-19 22:34:16 I see coins like $icx $zil $nano being very early and I’m comparison to stocks like fb aapl goog, the biggest gains may come in 2-5 years

182 2018-03-19 22:33:38 Can you guys talk about the relationship between stocks and cryptos. Today it’s inverse, but really it’s not entirely a good thing for crypto if all other securities except crypto completely bomb
183 2018-03-19 22:33:28 The markets started the week down due to a sell-off of tech stocks
184 2018-03-19 22:33:12 We own over $1,000,000 in utility stocks!  Average dividend is 5.5%!  Boring stocks but very little swing!  I’m 72, wife 68 and we still work in mortgage business, but act retired!  Lovin life!

186 2018-03-19 22:30:31 Won’t rising interest rates hurt the value of Dividend paying stocks?
187 2018-03-19 22:30:00 #Diversification refers to how well your #investment #portfolio is spread across the 3 major asset classes: stocks, bonds & cash.
188 2018-03-19 22:29:07 @GiveBloodNHS doesn't hurt and us actually quite relaxing (apart from taking off the plaster). Go give blood people It's a break from kids and they give you biscuits - blood stocks are low (and did I mention the biscuits?)
189 2018-03-19 22:28:50 Buy stocks that pay dividends. Genius. Thank you, Bill, you #StupidFuck.
190 2018-03-19 22:28:33 Stick to picking stocks , politics is obviously not your sweet spot
191 2018-03-19 22:28:30 @DennisE42333809 Any good stocks to put 20-30K? Something low but with chances of going up :)
192 2018-03-19 22:28:05 Wittgenstein told us long ago that the meaning of a word evolved. Just because you choose the textbook definition does not make you right. And it could be argued bump-stocks actually do an assault weapon make as they allow for aimed bump fire. A 12g is better for defense anyway.
193 2018-03-19 22:27:49 Some alts pump 20-30% in BTC value and people say alt season is here. HAHAHA. If alt season is 30% increases, then I may as well as stick with trading small cap stocks in the traditional market.

195 2018-03-19 22:27:29 Tip of the Day: now is a good time to buy dividend-paying stocks that don’t have wide price swings. Dow is down two thousand points from its high.
196 2018-03-19 22:27:19 When you can't even ban bump stocks or support closing loopholes in background checks you're just making excuses.
197 2018-03-19 22:26:54 not to mention that MOST of the tech stocks are rallying in after hours market....

200 2018-03-19 22:25:22 The selling spread across tech stocks and the broader market. The British Pound strengthened after the announcement of a successfully negotiated Brexit period @MicMcCarthy_CMC
201 2018-03-19 22:25:18 No, actually it isn't. bump stocks are a perfect example of why not. Before you knee-jerk this, do some research, we don't care a flip about them, never have. Semantics is the reason bump stocks are still legal.
202 2018-03-19 22:25:12 Do you buy stocks in cruise lines?  If so, what are the chief benefits for you?
203 2018-03-19 22:25:12 Stocks slumped overnight against a backdrop of growing international trade tension and a White House dialling up conflict with the FBI. Facebook led the falls with a 6% drop on news of a potential data breach involving political operatives @MicMcCarthy_CMC
204 2018-03-19 22:24:41 Again, to me the fundamental role of gov't is to protect the health & safety of its people, and #SB51 does just that. Bump stocks were created for two things: mass killing or recreation. A fun weekend activity is not worth more than the lives lost #coleg #copolitics

209 2018-03-19 22:23:20 Never said that Bayo wasn't a threat in doubles, she can certainly clean out stocks early if you aren't careful I just think that the risk reward of a combo being dropped is a lot closer to even than it is in Singles. But that's probably cause the characters I play in dubs.

223 2018-03-19 22:14:40 This is where common sense gun laws come into place:  universal background checks - including private sales; no semi autos so people under 21; no bump stocks; no high capacity magazines.

224 2018-03-19 22:14:35 $USB looks like a great entry point to me. RSI suggests a bit oversold. Buffett/Berkshire 7th largest holding. 2.25% dividend yield. Rising rates should help earnings. #banks #financials #stocks
225 2018-03-19 22:14:05 Can the EU not pay us for access to the fishing stocks in UK waters during the implementation period ?

227 2018-03-19 22:13:39 NO ONE WANTS TO TAKE AWAY YOUR GUNS! This is the same excuse we have heard for decades from the NRA to scare people. What is wrong with background checks, waiting 24-48 hours to pick up your gun, making bump stocks illegal?

237 2018-03-19 22:08:04 CFP was a disaster for fishing industry & marine environment up until the point the EU stopped accepting industry (and governments) demands to catch unsustainable amounts of fish. After that, sanity was restored and fish stocks have mostly stabilised. What will replace that?
238 2018-03-19 22:07:24 it's rare when everything someone touches or posts is tip top. i enjoy everything you post man.

251 2018-03-19 22:00:45 We have barely any regulations on guns.  And there are multiple legal add-ons like bump stocks that get around a lot of those laws.  Clearly, the laws we have aren't working, and the bomb laws are, since the # of bombings in a year is FAR exceed by the number of gun deaths.
252 2018-03-19 22:00:24 It's not even about bump stocks... bump stocks are ridiculous toys that no serious shooter even uses. It's about the slippery slope that banning them creates... we know what comes next. They aren't hiding the fact that they want a total gun ban anymore. #MolonLabe

262 2018-03-19 21:52:58 Standard* capacity magazines

Bump stocks are garbage and are best used for wasting ammo on an outdoor range 

Rounds fire as fast as you pull the trigger. One round per trigger pull. If you’re doing half second pulls, great for you! If you wanna slow it down, that’s cool too!
263 2018-03-19 21:52:26 Market Close: MBS -3bps; DOW -335.60; NASDAQ -137.74; S&P 500 -39.90; 10yr Treasury 2.86%;  Both stocks and MBS close off earlier lows.

278 2018-03-19 21:47:24 When you borrowed for 0% for years and bought equity, pushing up prices and creating a bubble in stocks, I would say no, not sustainable.

Interesting times we live in
280 2018-03-19 21:45:34 Don't over think it.  We live in a bubble economy.  They need another bubble to pump or things get bad fast.   Housing market is done for this cycle.  Stocks are obscenely overpriced and showing signs of crashing.  Crypto has years of growth ahead.  Only bright spot.
281 2018-03-19 21:44:52 Brilliant on bits of paper. Higher unemployment,  ordinary people not being able to afford to buy as much, ordinary pensioners worse off. I go on how it affects ordinary people not politicians, the privileged or ones holding stocks and shares or banker's

312 2018-03-19 21:27:24 Alafu hii Cambridge story ni a big deal. Facebook stocks are tanking.
313 2018-03-19 21:27:07 @realDonaldTrump HEY! @POTUS MAN UP!Take responsibility for the market dumping. My stocks are going to crap because of you and your working with the Russians!You always take credit for the positive. Any idiot can do that, a real person takes credit for their negative actions too!
314 2018-03-19 21:26:24 @TheFive   This is why pharma stocks took a dive.  So you think they aren’t the Top dog Drug dealers, Amen I rest my case!
315 2018-03-19 21:25:32 These stocks are costing people a lot of money. One tweet can save someone thousands.
316 2018-03-19 21:22:39 I definitely hear what you are saying. Most these stocks have disconnected  from the oil price as much as 60%. All the negatives are magnified. No doubt they are undervalued considering that oil is still 60+. Can be a frustrating sector to be in at the moment, but it will pay off
317 2018-03-19 21:22:07 Sup Chlo?

320 2018-03-19 21:19:24 Also banning bump stocks and military style weapons is not a repeal. When is enough fire power enough. Should the right to rpg or tanks or landmines be accepted......just my opinion only....not trying to be pissy

322 2018-03-19 21:18:30 What strikes me, is that the gap between oil stocks and oil price is getting bigger by the day. I can understand, that they go with the market, but not why CRZO fell by 4.4% as oil was virtually unchanged.
323 2018-03-19 21:17:41 And the biggest news:  MASSIVE buyback of STOCKS by corporations.  You got rich.  I got nothing.  And  trickle down economy does nothing. #TaxReform #TaxScamBill

328 2018-03-19 21:15:14 Your "message" was approved by the NRA. Politically calculated baby steps won't save you this fall. The NRA doesn't have enough money to buy your re-election.

381 2018-03-19 20:53:23 They are kind of right though. Crypto is just the new penny stocks, it's insane to put most of your net worth into something like that. This is why every investor guide you'll ever read tells you to diversify and buy to hold long term because its safer.
382 2018-03-19 20:53:10 Fair point, UXB. "consult" does not mean incorporate the consultations and "share of" does not does not define total catch.

396 2018-03-19 20:45:47 It doesn't make it full auto. To do that u need to change the whole mechanism of the rifle. Bump stocks simply take advantage of the recoil and basically makes you have the fastest finger in the world but losing all accuracy. But my argument stands that it is not a weapon of war

398 2018-03-19 20:45:26 2: "gun grabbers" phrase coined by the NRA 2 incite fear & boost gun sales. I'm a gun owner. Most gun owners favor UBC. Most Americans favor restoring the AR-15 ban & dump bump stocks. In other words common sense gun safety. 
NRA says that's wrong. It doesn't sell more guns.
399 2018-03-19 20:45:24 Did you even read the news Stephen Paddock had bump stocks. His rifle was not semi-automatic it was fully automatic. And you can buy an AR-15 style rifle or any large rifle for that matter at 18. You have to be 21 however to buy a handgun.
400 2018-03-19 20:45:12 In addition your (& others) good fortune so far, has been due to the Q easing by the Fed Res since 08; stocks, bonds & property have been pumped up internationally as a consequence. It may burst. Obama's stable economic policies also have meant things are now better than expected
401 2018-03-19 20:44:54 According to an NPR poll from last Octeober, 80% of Americans support a ban of assault-style weapons, bump stocks and a federal database to track gun sales. #ENOUGH #NeverAgain #MarchForOurLives

403 2018-03-19 20:44:30 I got into Penny Stocks by divine intervention. Three years ago I stopped at a gas station and this homeless man walked up to me and gave me a single penny (then he smiled at me and walked away). I instantly knew he was an undercover Angel

419 2018-03-19 20:38:08 I’m going to respond. I appreciated your response on the other thread. Most of us believed things would change after LV. At least bump stocks. I thought they would change after the church in TX. Hell I thought they would change after Columbine. But the targeting of kids is so
420 2018-03-19 20:37:54 im not denying that, sorry i misworded my response, i just don't attribute that to the groups.

426 2018-03-19 20:35:28 we must trade boring stocks :)
427 2018-03-19 20:34:27 A characteristic of traditional index investing is underscored today.

You are exposed to risk via market capitalization weighting.

Overvalued stocks are weighted more highly than undervalued stocks.

$SPY $QQQ etc.
428 2018-03-19 20:34:17 No, stocks selling off because the tech trade is overcrowded, and the fed will raise interest rates. Rising rates are and always will be a discount mechanism for future earnings. Fact. Nothing to do about Trump Economics 101
429 2018-03-19 20:34:04 both of those statements are false
430 2018-03-19 20:33:50 Stocks Definately took a beating today..

432 2018-03-19 20:33:24 Baffles me how people wonder why Eating Disorders are such a taboo subject however when a shop stocks a size two they’re branded “disgusting.” Is it really any wonder people feel as though they can’t talk about these things?
433 2018-03-19 20:33:23 $ARNA DAMN !! None of my stocks ever move like that.
434 2018-03-19 20:31:07 If they control our fishing waters they could decimate the stocks before we ‘take back control’
435 2018-03-19 20:30:02 Not sure I follow. It’s a state owned company. The money from the IPO will not end up in private pockets. So the next best thing would be buying the stocks for peanuts.
436 2018-03-19 20:29:06 I suppose so, these custodianship change plays...I seem to recall in the past some uncertainties surrounding these kinds of stocks but maybe Arcaro is known for sealing the deal. Just curious what his huge claim to fame is. What big company did he bring public?
437 2018-03-19 20:28:44 Will not be posting individual setups until we regain the 50 day SMA on $SPY  You always want to put the odds in your favor.

440 2018-03-19 20:26:17 Yea same thing happened when i was in IMLFF except it dropped way more than this, but in the morning it opened up at the price it closed at being OTC stocks do not trade pre-market or after hours.
441 2018-03-19 20:26:07 Denver bans bump stocks and they have 0 turned in.... same things gonna happen if they try banning semi-automatic rifles. Try getting me to give something up that a paid for, idiotic idea.

459 2018-03-19 20:18:36 If your political filter sees a president supporting gun ownership while threatening to ban bump stocks by executive order and saying "take the guns first... Due process second" you might want to replace your filter
460 2018-03-19 20:17:58 The key difference between the AR-15 and M-16 that make the M-16 "military" is the select fire. Which can be overcome with bump stocks and slide fire modifications. Same caliber, same firing mechanism, 20 round clip. It was designed for military use.

463 2018-03-19 20:15:44 First, there's not a huge demand for bump stocks.
Second, if you're the type of person to buy a bump stock, you're also most likely to give the govt the finger when they want to take it away, which I support.
464 2018-03-19 20:15:35 I see plenty of other bios down -5%+. You are being biased and cherry picking LPTX because you think it proves your theory. I NEVER trade stocks that I understand the bullish story of, and I EXPECT, not hope, positive news, literally any moment.

528 2018-03-19 19:50:46 Through NBHC, the then subsidiary of the now chargesheeted FTIL, when it was known in May-June 2013 that NSEL Warehouses had massive mismatch in stocks or rather no stocks in many, what did JShah-FTIL-NSEL do? Why confirm to DCA on 10Jul13 on availability of Rs6k crore stocks?
529 2018-03-19 19:50:27 One thought. For those of us not sitting on any gains. (I got out of all stocks earlier in the session without any serious damage), I guess it's just back to the drawing board of watching the indexes for clues that distribution is weaning. So I guess patience is necessary now.
530 2018-03-19 19:50:20 #stocks - blame it on Fed that will sink economy with 4 rate hikes. Fed Govs, dumb and dumber.
531 2018-03-19 19:49:06 Dow falls more than 350 points, S&P 500 drops 1.6% as Facebook drags tech stocks lower FB loss 5% and Executives are said to be dumping their stick incl Zuckerberg is that a sign that Google and Amazon are next??

533 2018-03-19 19:48:46 $CHFS Kind of lame but plenty of stocks do exactly this before earnings. May even signify a good report. Holding. #biotech #medical #stocks
534 2018-03-19 19:47:49 @realDonaldTrump, #TrumpFamily and the #TrumpSwampCronies have probably sold off their pharmaceutical stocks. #OpioidEpidemic #AlwaysAboutTheMoney #FollowTheMoney
535 2018-03-19 19:47:39 Why didn't Fraud accused mastermind JShah sell the Rs6K Crore stocks that he stated were available in NSEL Warehouses & confirmed not only to DCA on 10Jul13, but was reiterated by the now in-hiding JShah on national TV in August 2013 first week? Where did those stocks vanish?
536 2018-03-19 19:47:02 $TGLO EVERYONE should do some DD and UNDERSTAND the MAGNITUDE of what is taking place!  I WOULDN'T HESITATE TO GET IN! DOLLARS COMING IMO!! $TELL #LNG #stocks #NASDAQ #oilandgas #OTC $RSII $OWCP $SFOR $WUHN

548 2018-03-19 19:43:43 @claudiajordan @AishaThalia The FOMC is probably raising interest rates again this week nerds (to 1.75%). I'm grabbing some BAGS (of $$$) next month when Q1 earnings drop. Been riding the hizzo out of Bank stocks since tax-reform passed...actually even b4 that- just even more.
549 2018-03-19 19:43:03 PANSTELLAR ZAIBATSU stocks climb despite troubling geopolitical headlines
550 2018-03-19 19:42:41 @realDonaldTrump let’s ban assault weapons of mass destruction, high capacity magazines, bump stocks. There is no 2nd Amendment right to a assault weapon. Save kids lives now.   more @washingtonpost @nytimes @foxandfriends
551 2018-03-19 19:42:26 Fair enough.  However, Syria and North Korea had far larger chemical weapons stocks and far more active programs, North Korea had an active nuclear weapons program (the furthest along of any of the "Axis of Evil"), and Syria had nuclear ambitions.
552 2018-03-19 19:41:40 Model. Become a brand. Let hoes pay you for yo beauty. Build your name...

Take that money... invest. Think of a small business or 2. Then, then you got stocks... gotta get the stocks mayne. 


553 2018-03-19 19:40:48 My stocks trash today.
554 2018-03-19 19:40:45 Facebooks stocks are going down faster
555 2018-03-19 19:39:54 If it functioned more like Aura in the sense that you only got the knockback boost if you were behind on stocks and percent, it would mitigate the snowballing effect that it can have
556 2018-03-19 19:39:48 @CityOfCincy City Council is voting today whether or not to ban bump stocks. Not one crime was committed in the city or state using a bump stock. Meanwhile the city faces a heroin epidemic. Liberal Logic...

559 2018-03-19 19:39:09 In the end it’s up to Kazakh government officials to decide on the IPO. If I was a Kazakh official I would not mind the opportunity to pick up cheap stocks in a company that controls the world price for a commodity like uranium = Buy cheap stocks, then cut the #uranium supply.
560 2018-03-19 19:38:38 I dunno maybe it might be worth mentioning why FB stocks are plummeting?
561 2018-03-19 19:37:36 Goes to show Zuckerberg doesn’t even have faith in Facebook. Selling off his own stocks in the company.
562 2018-03-19 19:36:35 Mark Zuckerberg lost 4 billion dollars in stocks today, you don’t have a problem, calm down

569 2018-03-19 19:34:15 I like the idea of an ETF with stocks that touch the medical marijuana and marijuana research industries, such as certain pharma companies, hemp growers, processors. Due diligence is absolutely necessary. I already have my CFP looking into this area.
570 2018-03-19 19:33:39 Bonne idée. ET il y a pas mal de pays arabes qui veulent mettre des batons dans les roues d'Erdogan et pas des petits. A Afrin, l'Iran a été un bon fournisseur.
Concernant les missiles anti-chars il n'y aura pas de problème et ne pas oublier les stocks de Daech.
571 2018-03-19 19:33:11 No, you said this:”I said a few mods and it goes from semi to auto.”

No mention of bump stocks in your original claim.
So why aren’t mass shooters doing these “few mods”?
572 2018-03-19 19:32:38 I very hope you are right, but I‘m not sure if the cryptomarket can decouple when the financial market (stocks, bonds, real estate) crashs like 2008.

581 2018-03-19 19:29:13 Chase, I'm not a liberal. I'm a Republican, pro 2nd Amendment, and a Trump supporter. However, I've listened, done my research, and had life experiences. I support universal background checks, red flag laws, and banning bump stocks.
582 2018-03-19 19:28:56 Stocks getting beat up and rates are higher...information in this

589 2018-03-19 19:25:41 Stocks go up and they go down. Not all of us need make up reasons for every 1% move just so we can sell ads to sponsors. Most of us can just appreciate how normal it is instead.
590 2018-03-19 19:25:00 Yeah, I burned myself out harvesting all of those kidneys in the eighties. Wish I wouldnt have blown all that money on Bazooka Shmoe stocks... I thought it was that famous cartoon packing gum - but it turns out it was a failing smut magazine. Fuck.

592 2018-03-19 19:24:47 #stocks#MondayMotivations  The NYSE is becoming little more than a sandbox in which hedge funds and central bankers play. Everyone else is  taking his/her toys and are leaving for home.
593 2018-03-19 19:24:34 Julia Child here. I'm about to make shortbread cookies, so the world's butter supply is about to decrease significantly. Buy or sell your stocks accordingly. #TextsFromCelebChefs
594 2018-03-19 19:24:30 I am a big fan of the analogy of the egg and tennis ball from @markminervini:

 = Quick and strong rebound. These are the #stocks you want to hold.
595 2018-03-19 19:23:59 The biggest pushers are the drug and pharmeceutical companies. Guess somewhere in your portfolio there are some stocks and shares to be found of same.  So you are guilty as well.
596 2018-03-19 19:23:36 I was referring to what he did to the Irish.

597 2018-03-19 19:23:08 Every time to fight for Britain! Of course the reason we agree to the decisions is because they benefit us. We share the waters so that we have year round access to fish and have quotas to ensure fish stocks are replenished. The Spanish will fish our waters regardless & Us theirs
598 2018-03-19 19:22:57 some real panic in energy stocks with crude essentially unched today.

600 2018-03-19 19:22:50 These trades are done intraday on cash equity longs or shorts. These are low margins stocks and offer great returns. On Calls and Puts Should work equally well.
601 2018-03-19 19:22:27 Changes to the constitution *should* be difficult. But changes can be made without changing the 2A. Eg, banning bump stocks could possibly be done by EO. Pretty sure age rules could be introduced without changing the 2A.

604 2018-03-19 19:20:01 Way too little, too late.  Nothing short of a ban on military grade weapons and enhancements like bump stocks will suffice.  It's way past time to choose kids stafey and preservation of childhood over guns that civilians should not have.
605 2018-03-19 19:19:37 Could get a lot uglier for stocks if we get a Fed statement Wednesday that is more hawkish than expected. March fully priced in but all rates traders looking for guidance as to whether we get 3 or 4 hikes this year AND guidance on Fed’s thinking on terminal rate for this cycle.
606 2018-03-19 19:19:20 I'm watching my mother-in-law's money, which is scary. Have her only 10% in stocks because she's 85. Got over-eager and put too much in bonds.

616 2018-03-19 19:16:01 Merlin sighed heavily, hating that Arthur was making him do this. “I’m..afraid you’ll have to spend a few hours in the stocks tomorrow to make up for your behavior.”
617 2018-03-19 19:15:46 @realDonaldTrump AWESOME stocks are tanking because your political consultant Cambridge Analytical gained inappropriate access to Facebook data.  OMG RESIGN NOW
618 2018-03-19 19:15:36 The Fed (Powell) has made it clear that a decline in stocks isn't enough to derail the plan.  It would have to be big enough to be a risk to growth and/or financial conditions. 10% not likely to be that big.
619 2018-03-19 19:14:46 March 22 is the Canadian preliminary Senate vote for legalization, expect many of these stocks to keep running until. (Buy on rumor, sell on news)
620 2018-03-19 19:14:26 We need to build a wall so my pharmaceutical stocks will go up. No competition. But really we need to see doctors lose their license and or prison and pharmaceutical companies fined for giving doctors perks for pushing pills on patients for pure monetary reasons.
621 2018-03-19 19:13:58 This is just funny. Oh, its OK that stocks are plunging because the sell off is "orderly." Wow.
622 2018-03-19 19:13:58 The horrific murders of 58 people in Las Vegas in 2017 were committed using bump stocks, allowing the shooter to fire 90 shots every 10 seconds. We must act now! #malcolmgov

629 2018-03-19 19:10:08 The interest rate environment is no longer supportive for stocks. If the tape turns decidedly negative.. then it would be wise to heed the old adage.. don't fight the Fed, don't fight the tape.
630 2018-03-19 19:09:53 Not understanding why the stock market is down 445 points. It says stocks plunge on Facebook news. What happened??
631 2018-03-19 19:08:58 I like days like these. A lot of fluff is taken out and stocks get easier to price on the fundamentals.

634 2018-03-19 19:08:47 Assault Rifles and bump stocks are what folks want removed, not pistols. As a veteran I can tell you pistols  are not common on the battlefield. Assault rifles are intended to kill many people quickly. Why do you need these?

658 2018-03-19 18:58:02 Makes sense if true.  If arrested his people around him would make calls to the swamp hierarchy.  Signals  a swamp drain.  First thing they would do is panic sell stocks, try to dump their money into gold, art, etc.  Stuff they can hide so it can't be seized.  Dow Crashing -400
659 2018-03-19 18:57:51 also was the right thing to do. If you study the indexes & especially the $QQQ where the leaders reside, I've been defensive for awhile due to seeing some cracking in the FAANG stocks.  Today, they all broke open! I posted if they crack, what's left to hold up the market?

661 2018-03-19 18:56:26 For most of the 20th century, sex was assumed to be solely the province of rural and suburban America - it was understood that that people in cities were simply too busy doing stocks and business to have time for their libidos. Sex and the City changed all that.
662 2018-03-19 18:56:20 I understand.  Finance is the ONLY thing I use from Yahoo!  I don't have a login for them.  I also subscribe to the online W$J, but it's tedious if I just want to see quickly a few favorite stocks, and the DJIA.

670 2018-03-19 18:52:53 A new week and stocks are falling—US Dillar falling CRYPTOS UP ACROSS THE BOARD
671 2018-03-19 18:52:46 More than 2/3 support universal background checks, and a ban on assault weapons, large capacity clips & bump stocks. In case you’re bad at math, “more than 2/3” beats “nearly 2/3”. Oh, and universal background checks is WAY more than 2/3.
672 2018-03-19 18:52:30 Well the difference is that the % mechanic negates the need for a different bar. Each hit makes the opponent easier to knock out in terms of stocks.
673 2018-03-19 18:52:26 Part of the problem is that risk is often poorly defined, imo. Conventional wisdom would say holding cash is much less risky than holding stocks, but I would argue sometimes the inverse is true.
674 2018-03-19 18:51:49 Buying a gun should require MORE certification than a driver's license.
Bump stocks should have never been a thing.  Ban them. 
Do a little more research about semi automatic weapons. They're all one trigger pull per shot.
Bottom line...It's about the PERSON, not the gun.
675 2018-03-19 18:51:34 As I said before, every time a school shooter makes the news, gun stocks rally. Silently, those companies want school shootings to raise their stock as it raises fear in pro-gun ppl every time. And, a violent mentally ill person will find another way to kill, even without a gun.

686 2018-03-19 18:50:07 Thats sounds great for stocks!
687 2018-03-19 18:49:58 Lol, what does that really mean? Stocks drop no worries. I'm one to think the market will rise more but when I read this it makes me wonder.

690 2018-03-19 18:49:14 I suggest you check my tweets with a study i made regarding the 7 year cycle low in Gold and see why i'm bearish on Gold and Gold stocks for the long term. It's not just an opinion, it's based on historical facts.
691 2018-03-19 18:48:14 5 months ago my dad was shot in Las Vegas by a "man" using bump stocks to accelerate the horrific damage done, and today he's testifying his experience in front of the Senate to help push for more regulations. I don't think I've ever been so proud of him.
692 2018-03-19 18:48:07 We agree :)  It should be as hard to get a gun license as it is to get a driver's license, at the very least. And yes, gun instruction courses should be  part of the requirement. But I also believe that making bump stocks and semi automatic grade weapons illegal is common sense.
693 2018-03-19 18:47:33 I taught my own self about stocks just by researching and putting my mind to it..schools don't teach you and ain't nobody gone give you shit.

695 2018-03-19 18:47:14 Thanks as I got stung with a washout but the thanks as NFEC stung me on a washout but the market was fading at that time so I won’t be playing washouts again on stocks that are fading. Lesson learned
696 2018-03-19 18:47:06 Oh that's not gonna ever happen.End to traitors.Stocks in prisons will go up.LOCK UM UP!

698 2018-03-19 18:46:12 Of course it can change on a dime, but if stocks are down 400+ today and similarly tomorrow/Wed (say total of 1000pts in 3 days), it will be interesting to see how brave the #FOMC is  and if the Fed "put" is really dead. It seems the market is asking the question.
699 2018-03-19 18:46:08 All the retail traders must be starting to short, most of the stocks are turning to HTB. A bit late to start shorting.
700 2018-03-19 18:46:03 The declines are broadly spread with mining stocks nursing losses of 3%-5% with Anglo American down 4.27% and BHP off by 4%.

795 2018-03-19 18:07:42 One of these stocks could become the first trillion-dollar public company in the next few years. In this list: $AAPL, $GOOGL, $GOOG, $AMZN, $MSFT, $TCEHY, $BABA, $JPM, $JNJ, $BAC, $XOM
796 2018-03-19 18:07:29 My family is a “gun family”. I used to own guns. My brother died from suicide with a gun.  I think assault weapons and high volume magazines and bump stocks should be banned.  All gun purchases should be registered and involve a background check. No one under 21 should own a gun,
797 2018-03-19 18:07:27 My other devastatingly emotional and heartrending subtweet was mistaken by many Sunday tweeters for a press release from the Environment Agency about declining cod stocks in the North Sea.
798 2018-03-19 18:07:21 @mikeybangs I keep my Dividend stocks on Etrade... RH is just a good sand box to play in.

800 2018-03-19 18:06:34 Facebook is experiencing  its worst day since September 24, 2012. Facebook stocks lose more than  7.5% with the Cambridge Analytica scandal and the pressures of the  American authorities. This must make us reflect on social networks.
801 2018-03-19 18:06:25 If we cant get an assault penis ban can we at least do something about hump stocks?
802 2018-03-19 18:05:49 My stocks in class is the WORST loss ever.

SAD. AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
803 2018-03-19 18:05:28 Facebook connaît  son pire jour depuis le 24 septembre 2012. Les stocks Facebook perdent  plus de 7,5% avec le scandale Cambridge Analytica et les pressions des  autorités américaines. Cela doit nous faire réfléchir sur les réseaux sociaux.

806 2018-03-19 18:03:40 So who’s buying $FB at this dip? Facebook got Trump elected and made Brexit happen. Sounds like an endorsement of their platform. I doubt the people who benefited from this will now turn around and regulate it. #facebook #stocks #FANG

831 2018-03-19 17:54:24 It's a valid argument, but outdated. There is a reason for quotas and that is protection of fish stocks, removing quotas would be a bad idea especially when stocks have only recently returned to sustainable levels.

833 2018-03-19 17:53:39 Forecasting major indices and stocks are only a stranger's opinion of the security at this time, You should NEVER use this information as the SOLE basis of information to place a trade, use it to compliment your own research.

Alright friends, fam, and fellow competition, the 5th annual PTC will be Sunday August 12th.  No WoO sprint/late shows, ASCoC, Lucas Oil, local shows, rush lates/sprints/mods and no racing for the Penn Ohio stocks. Its like the best date ever. Itll prolly rain.
836 2018-03-19 17:52:44 I know many traders would like to see their stocks keep going up but pullbacks and corrections are part of what creates a sustainable trend and opportunities.

838 2018-03-19 17:51:40 One more time: we want gun CONTROL, no one is taking away your damn guns. No need for bump stocks or 100 round clips. We want mandatory registration, licensing, education and more rigorous application process. We do it to drive a car, we can do it to own a gun. Is that a problem?
839 2018-03-19 17:51:35 It's notably not a market wide hit - lots of my Stocks barely hit. Tech looks rough and Resources stuff.

849 2018-03-19 17:47:45 Hopefully the 'whole USA' is smarter than Colorado; banning bump stocks won't save anyone--ridiculous notion--more laws simply bind up law-abiding citizens, they won't stop criminals-Ever.

927 2018-03-19 17:22:42 easy money has been made a few times over the years. 90% of the stocks will go bye bye 1 day. the 10% left doing well, investors will focus on balance sheet, are the shares OV, pricing in perfection, if so, shares slide, if not, how much more upside when fundamentals kick in.

931 2018-03-19 17:21:35 Mid-Day: Stocks continue with their slide (DOW now down 400+) and MBS returning above the 25 DMA (up 6bps).
932 2018-03-19 17:21:13 $QQQ and $IWM now testing 50-day MAs. $SPY already slid below this line. Perhaps triangle on $SPY breaks to downside.  #stocks
933 2018-03-19 17:20:20 ETFs may reduce risk but they also expose the market to larger swings than make sense, effecting stocks they shouldnt.
934 2018-03-19 17:20:05 This guy on @CNBC just said 2015 still shapes us a positive year for stocks. Was he in a cave for 3 yrs and just woke up? :)
935 2018-03-19 17:19:55 So...are they going to send out the storm-troopers and murder 1000's just to get at these bump stocks? The "cure" may be worse than the "disease," Eh?

944 2018-03-19 17:17:33 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.
945 2018-03-19 17:17:30 With the exceptions I don’t think it will have that big of an impact.  The price of steel, and stocks right after the announcement might be as consequential as it gets.

962 2018-03-19 17:13:26 Unless they get their hands around this shit storm, this is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg. Not even kidding. I hold stocks forever. I participated in FB’s IPO. This company is toxic.

974 2018-03-19 17:10:15 Be courteous to all, but intimate with a few, and let those few be well tried before you give them your confidence. True friendship is a plant of slow growth, and must undergo and withstand the stocks of adversity before it is entitled to the appellation.

989 2018-03-19 17:05:52 Let’s get smart. Like the Las Vegas mass killer, background checks won’t stop killers. They can buy unlimited guns bullets bump stocks, no flags go off. If I buy more than one bottles  of cold medication, alarms go off

 Be emotional and sell everything.

1028 2018-03-19 16:51:14 @ReformedBroker @cnbc Yep.  "Sometimes stocks just go down" Sometimes the simplest statements are the most relevant.
1029 2018-03-19 16:50:34 Real traders know how to make money on the way up & on the way down. The large number of people who are losing the most money are people with pension plans who buy into big stocks & people with 401Ks.

1062 2018-03-19 16:44:19 Great pt on HY mkt; IMO importance of rising stock prices to US tax receipts (& therefore funding of rising US deficits) suggest stress of falling stocks in next crisis may not show up 1st in HY mkt, but rather in USD funding mkts (which've been seeing rising stress, of course)

1070 2018-03-19 16:41:28 It's not even about bump stocks... bump stocks are ridiculous toys that no serious shooter even uses. It's about the slippery slope that banning them creates... we know what comes next. They aren't hiding the fact that they want a total gun ban anymore. #MolonLabe

1091 2018-03-19 16:32:53 Quotas are designed to protect fish stocks and the future livelihoods of fishermen - it's always embarrassing when a few greedy people endanger an entire industry.

1124 2018-03-19 16:22:14 Lunatic is charged language. All NRA members are not lunatics. Suggesting people who advocate for gun control are "pushing for a civil war" would go squarely in the lunacy extremist bucket. We want backgrounds check, and ban bump stocks. That's very reasonable.

1138 2018-03-19 16:17:20 I would suspect that most folks with them are old enough to remember when collapsible stocks were put in the same category under the AWB under Klinton. Those were later ‘allowed’ and they all came out of their safes or storage. This will probably be the same

1160 2018-03-19 16:10:40 Weasel words from part-time Tory MP Douglas Ross: "Any *final* deal that does not deliver full control over fish stocks and vessel access will not have my support."  In other words, he's going to sell his constituents out by supporting the transitional deal.
1161 2018-03-19 16:10:33 The Dow was at 24782 when Trump signed the Tax Bill. Today it is at 24600 and falling. What exactly was supposed to happen again? Falling stocks, wage stagnation, flat employment, inflation, deficit increase, trade wars?

There are investments - anyone can invest. Anyone can buy a few stocks or trade on exchanges for a few bucks.

Anyone can start a business or become self-employed (and "exploit themselves").
1184 2018-03-19 16:00:21 For a serious answer, I think that smash 5 will be on a similar engine with a bit more hitstun. Faster paced gameplay would appease the melee community a little bit, but Nintendo would still be able to reuse a lot of assets. 3 stocks 8 minutes
1185 2018-03-19 15:59:46 So I’m down $5k in stocks TODAY. Extremely sad!
1186 2018-03-19 15:59:40 IT stocks, which were trading beautifully till last week, got hit badly today. Has the rally ended for now? Likely to lose some ground/consolidate. Fewer stocks in this outperforming sector to make new highs in the near term.
1187 2018-03-19 15:58:53 Put simply, it is BONDS, not stocks, that concern Central Banks the most. If stocks collapse, it’s a big deal for investors. If bonds collapse, it’s a big deal for entire countries/ the financial system.
1188 2018-03-19 15:58:36 Because our current financial system is debt-based in nature (meaning sovereign debt, not gold or some other asset is the bedrock of the financial  system) when Central Banks did this, they effectively created a bubble  in everything (including in stocks).
1189 2018-03-19 15:58:13 I am following you out of $FB. I still think it is one of the two most effective advertising machines ever created, but one rule I follow is this: there is no need to hold “battleground stocks”. If, when the storm subdues, $FB is still in great shape, I’ll buy it back.
1190 2018-03-19 15:58:11 A few workds about the stock market. Over 90% of investors focus almost exclusively on stocks. This is a mistake. The reality is that everything happening in stocks since 2008 has been the direct result of Central Banks creating a bubble in bonds.
1191 2018-03-19 15:57:59 #momentum portfolios of @VohiCapital @MysticWealth11 @WeekendInvestng all having more than 80% cash. Clearly not many stocks able to sustain momentum... When was the last time you had such large cash position?

1195 2018-03-19 15:56:24 Please be reminded that the US Financial Industry Regulatory Authority issued an alert in January warning of a RECORD HIGH LEVEL of margin loan borrowing ($665.72 billion). Investors may be continuing to underestimate the risks of borrowing money to buy stocks.
1196 2018-03-19 15:56:07 I got some money invested, in the prison system stocks.
1197 2018-03-19 15:55:48 Ayo shoutout to Facebook for making all these stocks drop now it's my time to shine
1198 2018-03-19 15:54:49 I think this is right​ time to buy  good stocks for future if I am wrong correct me.. what's the view regarding PNB share..
1199 2018-03-19 15:54:29 If you are investing in real estate and it’s a business then buying a home is considered a asset. Although there stocks, options, currencies, REITS, ETFs, fixed income products, corporate bonds that can yield returns equal to a home without the hefty down payment.
1200 2018-03-19 15:54:10 I’m not into penny stocks. No offense, but I think it’s a suckers game.

1207 2018-03-19 15:52:06 there's a exclusive home store that stocks them here in Newcastle but you can buy them on amazon
1208 2018-03-19 15:52:05 I still focus on companies that have solid Earnings growth & GE Ratio. However, life  isn't perfect, stocks that set up well with good Relative Strength are sometimes good risk-reward plays. I traded it because of high momentum probability, though with smaller than my usual qty.
1209 2018-03-19 15:51:07 Horrible. We all need to #unfriendfacebook. Sell your Facebook stocks and close your accounts. At the least erase all of your data on Facebook so they can’t take advantage of your personal data against your will.

1227 2018-03-19 15:45:52 des questions mais pas celle de son intégration. Après est-ce que les stocks sont à 10 missiles ou 10.000? Réponse simple: personne n'a la réponse ici. 

On peut faire des théories autant qu'on veut mais on ne dispose actuellement d'aucuns chiffres sur cette question.
1228 2018-03-19 15:45:20 The guy in Vegas would not have been able to shoot over 500 people with a hunting rifle. Bump stocks and AR 15's made that possible.
1229 2018-03-19 15:45:20 Sovereign wealth fund should definitely step up its buying of US large cap stocks!
1230 2018-03-19 15:45:15 Everyone loves the FANG stocks until ONE of them is down and moves the whole market. $FB
1231 2018-03-19 15:44:50 Since I don’t have a staple income stream I’ll just buy those stocks that typically pay out increasing dividends in a downturn during high consumer confidence scenarios such as now & especially if I have a partner like @InvestmentOne  advising me. #MyInvestmenPlan
1232 2018-03-19 15:44:41 (2/2)...Considering today's drop was precipitated by a news release on $FB, I'd argue that nobody "predicted" today's drop but that they got help from an unexpected news item to push stocks in the direction they expected based on their indicator/setup
1233 2018-03-19 15:44:33 It’s amazing how difficult it is to pass legislation when your elected officials consider the rule of law. I’m sure you know that if Obama had prohibited bump stocks at that time, it would have become a lawsuit likely appealed up to the Supreme Court.

1290 2018-03-19 15:25:37 alas it turns out that there are actually people that fabricate meetings to get the reclaims. Those people should be placed in stocks at entry to each institute. and then forced to submit travel reclaims for everyone else. forever.
1291 2018-03-19 15:25:20 I agree although in 2015/2016 when it was ugly I’m sure it’s hard not to think about switching. Those that never do hedge also seam to do better when diversified (own farm ground and yes even stocks) which I think is the best method despite being hedger or not.

1297 2018-03-19 15:23:21 My personal opinion is that the CFP has worked. UK fishermen want to fish more, potentially depleting the stocks. The whole point of this discussion is that the Tories promised to give the fishermen what they wanted in return for votes. Then went back on that promise.

1312 2018-03-19 15:19:30 I think sanctions on Iran and the resolve of #NAFTA will give Canadian oil stocks (well, the TSX) a massive boost.  Both could come within 1-2 months; plus, then it is summer time which should also be great.
1313 2018-03-19 15:19:14 I feel if more responsible gun owners, like yourself, informed the @NRA that they don’t think bump stocks are a necessary product on the firearms market, we could finally see politicians cross the aisle and make positive change in this increasingly dire situation.
1314 2018-03-19 15:18:36 How do you see economy stagnate? There have been more jobs, stocks have been up. Your master sold 20% of our uranium to the Russians. A treasonous act.
1315 2018-03-19 15:18:08 $TSLA Goldman is usually late  the last to up or downgrade historically its best to buy their downgrade as they will be buying their own downgrade as well.

1316 2018-03-19 15:18:03 Sold $FB, which prob still has new highs ahead long-run. But instinct for 2-3 months has been to take gains. Too much random lurching, lack of candor on serious issues, declining usage, and societal harm.  Won't usually sell into a mild panic. But it was time. #facebook #stocks
1317 2018-03-19 15:17:56 Tomorrow will be my first official day of trading stocks.
1318 2018-03-19 15:17:46 I really appreciate your perspective on firearms and their technical specifics. I think it’s worthy to point out that bump stocks were utilized in most recent mass shootings in which ar-15 type rifles were used. They essentially make those rifles into weapons of war.

1326 2018-03-19 15:14:30 The money managers who set their algos to have their oil positions track other things that are not oil related (stocks, the dollar, etc) are the ones that either end up losing, or underperform any energy index.

1329 2018-03-19 15:13:33 Nope, 2/3rds of NRA enthusiasts agree that the focus should be school safety and mental health.  The rest of the nation agrees that the focus should include banning bump stocks and AR-15 weapons.

1349 2018-03-19 15:09:08 By early 2010, stocks had bounced 80%, oil was trading $100-150bbl, China had launched a massive fiscal stimulus and the Fed had loaded the bazooka. Expecting rates to crawl back to 2-2.5% didn’t seem so crazy.
1350 2018-03-19 15:08:58 U.S. Stocks declined globally on Monday amid a technology selloff and as investors braced for a week packed with risk events, from central bank decisions to a G-20 gathering. Government bonds also fell, while the pound jumped on a Brexit breakthrough.

A - An active mutual fund whose results almost exactly mirror their corresponding index (but nonetheless charges a higher fee.)  Usually due to the fund diversifying into too many similar stocks as their index.

1740 2018-03-19 12:38:59 Respectfully, I think you will find that investors will value stocks as they see fit!!!! It is a free market.  Shareholder returns are driven by return on equity (ROE).  This is driven by the underlying business return and financial leverage.  The latter risks blow ups.

1818 2018-03-19 11:55:53 Cryptos (in general) are not a scam, but many of the ads were either very misleading or blatant scam like Bitconnect.

They are banning binary options and high-leverage credit trading for stocks and indices.
1819 2018-03-19 11:54:45 People can always trade their paychecks for company shares.

1861 2018-03-19 11:23:07 Very simple, stocks drop when users who bring traffic drop the apps. You have no idea how many people use some social media apps simply because their fave is using it. No way stocks will still be high when you're losing credibility and driving top users away.

2183 2018-03-19 06:01:19 #Nifty charts are highly bearish, Crucial Support levels to keep an eye  on 10120-10095. Avoid any bottom fishing. No recommendations for intraday  trading.

2185 2018-03-19 06:01:14 It's not patents it's adoption.  Wall street doesn't have a patent on stocks.  That's just where they trade.  Fidelity doesn't have a patent on mortgages that's just a company.  If a company can do it better then that's your answer.  Cc companies charge 3% Ltc 1-2%.  Easy.

PTJ - I’ve seen too many things go to zero, stocks and commodities.  The whole trick in investing is: “How do I keep from losing everything?”  If you use the 200-day moving average rule, then you get out.  You play defense, and you get out.

2305 2018-03-19 04:03:04 Options are psychologically harder to hold on to because the percentage change in P?L will fluctuate much greater than even the most volatile stock.  But I think the same rules should apply for LEAPS as to stocks since the time decay isn't really a factor even for ATM calls.

2361 2018-03-19 03:18:46 all they do is raise their own salary, fatten their benefit packages, buy their own stocks, and hide the money in Swiss bank accounts.

2420 2018-03-19 02:15:52 So you know where I stand: Full auto should be a no go. Background checks for all should be implemented, even private sales. Bump stocks=nope. Domestic violence convictions cannot purchase. Felons cannot purchase. Semi auto AR-15 I am good with. GVRO needs to happen nationwide.
2421 2018-03-19 02:13:45 So why did you sell your bank stocks after getting a private briefing on a pending  bank crisis??
2422 2018-03-19 02:12:15 All but you are making really good money if you have any in stocks, all because of him..  lol
2423 2018-03-19 02:11:37 Learning about normative goals and financial management of stocks...at 10pm
2424 2018-03-19 02:11:23 And the bank stocks went up.
2425 2018-03-19 02:11:16 Still better than stocks.
2426 2018-03-19 02:10:32 I think most people can agree on change but banning AR15s and bump stocks do nothing when laws aren’t followed.  At any point in time Cruz could have been Baker Acted but nobody did, why?  Why not blame Broward County Officers?  They did nothing!
2427 2018-03-19 02:10:15 BABA TWTR NFLX AAPL FB AMZN will continue to grow while a few pharma stocks AGN MRK & auto cos VLK Toyota F TSLA will draw lot of attention #stocks, #wallstreet

2431 2018-03-19 01:57:47 Not talking about investments the conversation was about interest rates which are different than a return on stocks!!!
2432 2018-03-19 01:56:36 1. #Cryptocurrency will still outperform traditional investment tools like stocks and bonds by EOY.

2. Regulations will accelerate the rate of mass adoption of cryptocurrency

3. If you cant stomach the dips, you don't deserve the gains

2445 2018-03-19 01:48:36 That’s correct.   If the stocks violate their short term MAs in a meaningful way then the setup is invalidated

2471 2018-03-19 01:20:56 European stock markets rose on Friday, tracking US markets higher as a spate of positive data gave traders a reason to shake off concerns. Deutsche Telecom jumped 2%, Merck advanced 1.5% and Daimler rose 1.4%. Financial stocks also saw gains as HSBC climbed 1.2%, BNP Paribas
2472 2018-03-19 01:19:21 US stocks mostly rose on Friday, but the key indices all ended lower on the week amid trade-war tensions and concerns the revolving door in the White House had not yet stopped turning.

2483 2018-03-19 01:08:56 I respect Kyle's opinions and yours too. But did Kyle inspire a million-person march on D.C. this Saturday? Did Kyle make Florida's legislature and Republican gov enact a new law to ban bump stocks & raise the age to 21 to buy a rifle?  Has Kyle generated millions in donations?
2484 2018-03-19 01:07:13 Bump stocks added on would use the firearm's recoil to bounce back against the trigger finger, firing faster than one could normally pull.
Bumps stocks are going away, though, by executive order in some way?

2488 2018-03-19 01:01:37 Hmm I can’t find myself complaining about something I can fix via training and studying. That’s why although I lose stocks in the most stupid way, deep down I know there were things I could have done to prevent it. All about acceptance and improving
2489 2018-03-19 01:00:28 Lmao. Get over yourself, Paul! We should shore up background checks & pool resources. We should then make said checks truly universal by closing loopholes, reporting private sales, etc. Shore up the system. Ban bump stocks, discuss waiting periods, large mags, certain ammo, etc.

2494 2018-03-19 00:58:31 Bingo
2495 2018-03-19 00:58:16 Thanks for reply. Topic was bump stocks modification not even gun which with one continuous trigger pull makes some semis fire as close to full automatic as makes no difference. We can't see inside any mass shooter's head (if could we'd stop them). Bump stock not gun. What right?
2496 2018-03-19 00:56:18 Although I don’t understand very much, I find it ever so fascinating to just sit on the stocks app. Nothing like future aspirations. Who knows what the future holds? 
2497 2018-03-19 00:56:17 OPEC for starters. They govern the production figures and to a great degree prices. Then there are the stocks and futures markets. But Putin is diversifying his economy. Look at the financial figures for Russia. They’re doing very well in the face of sanctions.
2498 2018-03-19 00:55:58 Some stocks breakout and fail, others succeed. Question is why do some fail and some succeed. Answer to that is worth millions...

2538 2018-03-19 00:10:38 Kevin, I can't say most are scams but I would say a good portion are scams and others mostly are business failures when it comes to #pinksheets, #otcbb stocks. However, you ride the wave, buy rumor sell news. Ride the wave!

2543 2018-03-19 00:04:18 Nicole does great work and they have a lot of experience on the coast there. They do a nice job looking at C sources and sinks. One question I have always had is what is the percent of massive ice in permafrost. Plays a big role in C stocks and response as to disturbance.
2544 2018-03-19 00:02:59 I too am embarrassed to say I live In the state you represent.  I am so sick of hearing that taking away bump stocks and assault rifles is taking away your 2nd amendment rights.  Hell that isn’t even an infringement!
2545 2018-03-19 00:02:36 I didn’t say that he didn’t. What I said was that people can access the power level of autos simply by obtaining semis and then attaching bumper stocks and other empowering accessories. Nice try though.
2546 2018-03-19 00:00:45 After last year's ACT at NHMS, I'm ok with it. I like the Pro Stocks there better than the Late Models.
2547 2018-03-19 00:00:26 I got a plan. How about the death penalty for politicians who don't live up to their campaign promises? Keep the lines straight. Number one. Number six million, we will be with you shortly. NRA members coming with their AR-15's. Aisle 5 we are running out of bump stocks.
