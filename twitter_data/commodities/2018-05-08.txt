33 2018-05-08 22:31:08 Adequate disciplinary actions should be meted to both the drug addicts and those couriering the commodities . Our judiciary should hadten any drug case. The general public should also complement the works of security agencies by reporting any case immedieatly
34 2018-05-08 22:25:47 .Tu partido, el Fraude Amplio, llevó la deuda de 13000 a 60.000 millones en 12 años de boom de commodities. No hicieron ni 1 puente, ni puerto, ni aeropuerto, ni carretera, ni vías, ni hospitales, NADA. Todo viajes y sueldazos a militantes.
35 2018-05-08 22:15:50 Em tempo, primeiro governo K usufruiu bastante do boom de commodities mas sem os demais êxitos do Lula I, por exemplo.
36 2018-05-08 22:14:27 The announcement of a surplus is not actually achieving it.   It's only based on improving prices for our commodities,  which could disappear in a puff of smoke.   Plus the workers tax cuts don't happen til next July,  2019 !
37 2018-05-08 22:12:26 Primeiro governo K usufruiu bastante do ciclo de commodities. De resto, longe de ser um Lula I, por exemplo.
38 2018-05-08 22:12:07 my thing is that companies are not motivated by ethics, especially tech startups that are beholden to investors. They are motivated by profit. It's not like these companies are providing any precious commodities. I think government should take over.
39 2018-05-08 22:11:06 There is nobsurplus - yet - and it's only positive SD unless to announce if the price of commodities rises.   If China got bolshy,  it would be gone in a puff of smoke.

71 2018-05-08 20:03:45 And expect gas prices to go way up. 
This will lead to higher groceries and other commodities, higher airfare, high anything that is trucked in or brought in by train, air or boat.
So what is Plan B? What does the US get out of this? How is this MAGA?
72 2018-05-08 20:02:37 commodity fetishism is not recognizing the process by which commodities are made or some shit, not fetishizing/worshipping commodities I'm not sure if there's a word for that
73 2018-05-08 19:58:00 Do you even know what the deal was? Or do you just think it's bad because Fox and Friends told you it's bad? You do realize the direct result of all of his "tough" deal making is raising the prices of commodities?
74 2018-05-08 19:57:56 Guess what? If the 'food box' program goes through, the few groceries in poverty areas will close. They won't have access to healthy food at all. I've worked with commodities before and they are not necessarily healthy. Nor will these food boxes address people on special diets
75 2018-05-08 19:45:50 It’s history. Especially when you consider earlier social constructs where a woman was to be seen and not heard. Men in other regions still see women this way and they do what they want and step all over us bc were commodities not humans. It’s simply history

78 2018-05-08 19:40:15 It’s absurd to you because you think ideas are free commodities to be possessed and disseminated as you see fit. That’s a white imperialist mindset. Cultural appropriation is the theft and commodification and possession of things sacred and valuable to another group.

114 2018-05-08 17:50:30 Human beings are not commodities. They are not goods. Their misery is not morally excusable because of the demands of the market. They grieve, & suffer, & feel despair. They lose their dignity w/ their jobs. Their sense of self worth.
115 2018-05-08 17:46:34 I'll look into those options.  I especially like the AFWERX idea.  GSA is great for commodities, but do they work well when development is required?

I have no idea why the lab PK shop said "no" to RIF. SPO/PK supported through source selection (completed in Dec).

120 2018-05-08 17:22:18 Throwing the grandparents or the parents out on the street forces their children to support them or not, is it a new tax?

122 2018-05-08 17:21:19 I understand perfectly fine.  Nobody should be forced to pay for the bad personal decisions of others.  I know a meth addict, he is not using his phone for job interviews.  He also gets food stamps and because he is part native, he gets commodities.  He lives with his mom.

125 2018-05-08 17:15:00 A crise de 2001 com o default trouxe para o presente o pior efeito possivel: dificuldade em se financiar e falta de reservas. Eles perderam o “boom” das commodities gastando muito e sem “crédito na praça”.

132 2018-05-08 16:26:20 I’ve never felt like video games, comics, anime, etc were rare or unique commodities man. All kinda people like that stuff
133 2018-05-08 16:18:21 None of which was illegal.  Commodities trading is very different than securities trading, in part because under normal circumstances the price of a commodity in all but the very short term is considered to be largely immune from manipulation.  Except in this case, it wasn’t.

137 2018-05-08 16:09:29 Ahora, una vez que los aplaudieron, los atacan porque las reservas no alcanzan, las commodities por los suelos, no hay aranceles a las X del campo (dólares) y, con una industria patria derruida, no hay sustitución de M y sale más barato comprar fuera y vacaciones fuera.

169 2018-05-08 14:29:41 An interesting take is the NYT which cites a “swap” instrument that would allow banks to deliver custody of cryptocurrencies to their customers 24 hours later.  This would put it under the umbrella of Commodities and Futures and BANG, regulated and compliant.
170 2018-05-08 14:28:28 Makes sense. EUR based incomes (EU funds, etc), USD based expenses (imports of consumer goods and commodities). Lower EURUSD costs CEE more cash for the same transaction (and vice versa) - broadly speaking

178 2018-05-08 13:53:24 The problem is politicians don't care. Oil may be a diminishing resource. But, it's not diminishing enough that it can't provide politicians with generational wealth, stashed in offshore accounts. When oil finishes, we move to solid minerals, then agric commodities.
179 2018-05-08 13:51:27 I’m guessing we’re going to be doing this weekly until @realDonaldTrump is out of the @WhiteHouse. Look at how he treats his own children. They are commodities to him. Just resources to be leveraged and traded.
180 2018-05-08 13:50:13 However, tactically allocation to gold and other commodities/real assets, when 1) inflation is rising and 2) monetary policy is tightening, does provide with excess return over the broad market.

183 2018-05-08 13:27:18 @mamangilu and @Waititu_Babayao should be organizing their farmers and retailers into cooperatives & they broker long term contracts for cheap prices of Agri commodities. The weather is increasingly uncertain & the people are not economically strong to sustain steep price hikes.
184 2018-05-08 13:23:55 I'd say yes but that should be true of IG as well, which is why I think it's more of the continued reach for yield than commodities
185 2018-05-08 13:23:24 You do understand that aborted infant parts are sold and even consumed. Not murder according to you, @TyreeCWebster, so you are also agreeable to the unborn as commodities?

198 2018-05-08 12:50:29 Its understandable that earnings are cyclical for most companies and even more so for commodities. But difficult to grasp that prices are cyclical. Prices short term reflect emotions and long term reflect earnings growth so where does cyclicality of prices come in ?

232 2018-05-08 10:46:36 Actually money was just a store of value. It wasn't "meant" for anything. Buying and selling commodities for profit has pretty much always been a thing.

Even Native American cultures bought and sold for profit in their own civilizations.
233 2018-05-08 10:45:38 transforming into more money. The person buys the goods with the interntio of selling for higher. This is mercantilism M-C-(M + delta M). No production of commodities takes place by the merchant. He is a mere intermediary who profits from the losses of the person who he bought
234 2018-05-08 10:43:01 exchange of commodities. Commodities that were produced by the traders themselves and not merely bought in order to sell for higher. Who is doing the commodity production? Is it the investor? In your example of the anime store you have simply cited another instance of money

238 2018-05-08 10:12:19 I think you mean "nonhuman animals are disposable commodities", given that humans are obviously a species of animal too (certain members of which have also been treated like property/disposable commodities throughout history).
239 2018-05-08 10:02:22 Animals are disposable commodities. 

People are superior to animals.  

It is right and proper than domestic animals are well looked after.  It is right and proper that animals are killed for human benefit, including food.  

Death is not the worst thing.  It is part of life.

278 2018-05-08 06:16:14 The perfected currency swap deal thing by CBN with Chinese apex bank will surely increased effective trade volumes with Nigeria.

306 2018-05-08 03:44:32 Quick question: is it okay for parents to peg a price (dowry) for thier daughter, and make it a mission for the man to meet the expected roora. Would women have a presser to denounce an act that makes them look like commodities? Or it's not the same.
