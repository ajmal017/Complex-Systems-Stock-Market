1 2018-01-22 23:59:45 I gotta put this any way. Why do you think the good Lord put oil on this earth
2 2018-01-22 23:59:35 Or you stopped deforesting the global south to make the world safe for palm oil? Or started offering low income communities reparations for the babies who died because of your infant formula "not-our-fault" marketing efforts.Your brands (and Glendale) are stronger without y'all.

What's next, rebuild the whale oil industry?
5 2018-01-22 23:59:05 I feel like an oil spill in your blue sky

9 2018-01-22 23:58:46 The explosion is the latest in a series of accidents at oil and gas fields in the state. A gas explosion occurred at a Trinity Resources well in the same area in February 2017, injuring a worker.
10 2018-01-22 23:58:43 apparently gotta get an oil change too that’s eem cuter
11 2018-01-22 23:58:38 @KNWAnews @5NEWSSeth Quinton rig is gas well, not oil well. Derrick wasn't "blown off"- got hot & soft. Rig not on fire, is metal. Collapsed w pipe so they experienced a blow out, possibly while running casing? BPO should've worked otherw's

13 2018-01-22 23:57:55 Spoke w my local CA legislators & came away from the convo feeling optimistic.

34 2018-01-22 23:57:25 He has no problem with the Democratic party because he is a Democrat at heart. Republican ideals and beliefs do not mix with Democratic ideals and beliefs. It's like oil and water. He HAS done enough damage to our Country.
35 2018-01-22 23:57:24 @Perluadvanced - thank you for the great customer service! Had an oil change done last Saturday morning.
36 2018-01-22 23:57:21 Motor oil, exhaust system and an MSD ignition module.
37 2018-01-22 23:57:12 they have north sea oil.
38 2018-01-22 23:56:29 Hailey comes from the shower and tells us she has a great makeup remover. She goes into the kitchen and brings out a bottle of vegtable oil and SLAPS a glob on her face. And then states it gives her a natural glow. We were shook.
39 2018-01-22 23:56:25 Anything liquid Ultra biotin that I order and I go to Walmart and get liquid argon oil and another one i gotta look and I take them by mouth
40 2018-01-22 23:56:23 I also think this may be aimed at getting other countries to impose tarriffs on solar to hurt the market overall, thereby helping oil and coal producers. But not my field.
41 2018-01-22 23:56:20 Way to go moronic bully. Payback to the Oil guys meanwhile China  is building huge solar energy facilities all over the world. Way to make us a second tiered country:

44 2018-01-22 23:56:02 I’m taking a nutrition class and she showed us a chart of worst to best and it was one of the worst. But maybe virgin coconut oil is better?
45 2018-01-22 23:55:57 No surprise here Ed. Oil companies are his friends. Getting rid of regulations to keeping our earth healthy etc. no vision in America or American ingenuity. Soooo taking a backwards step for America.
46 2018-01-22 23:55:56 Trump and his Big Oil Gang owners Love Chemtrails. 
Solar energy has the power to defeat Oil Dependency. #BanChemtrails #BanGeoEngineering #EndBigOilGangs #ImpeachTrumpANDPenceNow #GoSolar
47 2018-01-22 23:55:51 I was so excited to go home after this oil change then I remembered it’s Lil niecey‘s Birthday party ina few I wanna sleep but also wanna clean my room but also just wanna eat and drink #shittogetherNot *in yoda’s voice
48 2018-01-22 23:55:27 top tip: baby oil works better as a makeup remover than makeup wipes.....
also helps to moisturise so two birds and all that!!
49 2018-01-22 23:55:25 So he's trying to put a strangle hold on solar energy while giving coal and oil free reign. What a surprise.
50 2018-01-22 23:55:16 I think this is pretty much what is done today, except instead of oil baron sons we have international undergraduate and Masters students
51 2018-01-22 23:55:00 คนไหนวะ
52 2018-01-22 23:54:40 For What? The elite cannot even squeeze oil out of them... guess the military-industrial machine needs something to continue justification of current spending levels..

54 2018-01-22 23:54:30 Weird #30inchestallandturning18 is promoting the fact CBD oil is illegal in the UK when it is very much LEGAL??? I literally got my dad CBD for Christmas for his sciatica pain. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH AND DONT BELIEVE ALL TV SHOWS

56 2018-01-22 23:54:24 i’m going to rant because i hate how men don’t think woman are capable of DOING ANYTHING right that has to do with their car? like yes i can top off my oil and yes i know what i’m doing? can you not approach me and ask. it’s oil... in a car... leave me alone
57 2018-01-22 23:54:17 おめっと！
58 2018-01-22 23:54:13 National will stand up to the oil industry? Yep we welcome that discussion.

62 2018-01-22 23:53:50 Calm down ! Don't know what the price of oil is off the top of my head and we would use which ever currency we decided to use
63 2018-01-22 23:53:41 The Central Intelligence Agency Doesn't Need to Change At All In The Way's I Would Envision Them And The Policy The Things that Need to Change are The Necessary Standards I Litigation on the Food Money to Pentagon Always Being the Bush Family and the Oil Business That Fed Them
64 2018-01-22 23:53:35 If your man works on cars you better give his ass props cuz I had oil and gas all over me and I smell like oil and it fucking sucks
65 2018-01-22 23:53:14 Nothing like a fresh juice with almond butter, coconut oil, and aluminum-free almond butter to start the day. Feeling blessed.

67 2018-01-22 23:52:57 Am I one of the last people on this planet to find out coconut oil clogs pores and ISN’T a recommended face moisturizer??!??!!
68 2018-01-22 23:52:34 Nope. Time to develop alternatives. Although trump just levied a 30% tariff on solar panels for his oil buddies. 
69 2018-01-22 23:52:32 Why my coworker tell a customer we ran out of oil so we can’t do his oil change 
70 2018-01-22 23:52:25 Lol no never with no hot oil
71 2018-01-22 23:51:53 i want sesame oil all over my body
72 2018-01-22 23:51:32 Same. The quality of my skin has improved tremendously now that I use coconut oil. No breakouts, no more dry skin.
73 2018-01-22 23:51:17 An organic raw food diet, cannabis oil and hope for as many days as possible.
74 2018-01-22 23:51:15 a new kick in the ass to renewable energy and a palm in the back for oil companies.. shamefull !!
75 2018-01-22 23:51:14 If it’s the natural peanut butter with all the oil on top, then it can be good for that, but for a regular thing of peanut butter like Jif, it’s not.
76 2018-01-22 23:51:09 Clean power is bullshit. We have an oil based society. Everything around you right this second has petroleum in it...
77 2018-01-22 23:50:47 Oil Company Donors sent a memo to the WH
78 2018-01-22 23:50:45 No doubt he will be proud to promote how he succeeded in approving a pipeline to tide water to carry Alberta Oil Sands product to Pacific markets to all his Jet Set celebrities
79 2018-01-22 23:50:42 Coconut oil 
80 2018-01-22 23:50:39 Was he there or just taking  oil Donnie’s word for it?
81 2018-01-22 23:50:39 By the way, who doesn't own a ton of oil stock.  You would have to be an idiot to not hold a position in oil.
82 2018-01-22 23:50:33 I'd be willing to think that that might need to be more of a priority if environmentalist hadn't been crying that we were going to be running out of oil within the next 20 years for over 100 years.
83 2018-01-22 23:50:23 Let more Mexicans into Calf. to increase crime Arnold and increase taxes to pay for them all. Forget about the oil you won't need it when Calif is broke and people won't be able to afford it. You don't have a clue what you are saying.
84 2018-01-22 23:50:18 Why don't you buy @seashepherd a ship to protect our coastline from the threat of oil barrons?
85 2018-01-22 23:50:18 We are so happy to lend our support over the next couple of years!  We loved seeing the kids and their reaction to Story Avenue!

88 2018-01-22 23:50:00 Whenever I wear weave I oil my real hair everyday and make sure I take my hair vitamins
89 2018-01-22 23:49:30 Let the healing oil of God flow from the top of your head to the sole of your feet..  Be made whole! In the name of Jesus!!
90 2018-01-22 23:49:23 My Mother has no trust in me  She gave me 2 tablets of cod liver oil. I told her I ate already, she was are you sure? Did you throw it away? Let me check your pocket!! HAHAHAH 
91 2018-01-22 23:49:08 i think how natural twitter hopped on the coconut oil bandwagon & now they see that’s it really isn’t all that good

93 2018-01-22 23:48:36 Right. Supporting oil. Or coal. No. Backassward thinking. This is the rich getting richer. California, find a way around this.
94 2018-01-22 23:48:34 3 days in still loving the smell and feel of the beard with the new beard oil @jcefidel #vBeards
95 2018-01-22 23:48:30 Last tanker left on 31st oct with 190,000 barrels of oil. They pump 2150bpd. 84 days since last tanker left.
84 x 2150 =180,600.
96 2018-01-22 23:48:21 Don't feel bad have to see a specialist to fix an old rootcanal under a broken wisdom tooth. Clove oil mixed with olive oil for me indefinitely until I come up with cash for a few other tests regarding my health. At least you have nice weather Kina. Smell the flowers.
97 2018-01-22 23:48:08 SDF & Assad already have agreements concerning the oil fields do that is not a real issue.
98 2018-01-22 23:48:05 It's only that if we let Big Oil #FossilFuel interests make it that way. If we don't let them put short-term profits before our long-term health, energy-independence, & profits, & phase out fossil fuel subsidies & invest in #RenewableEnergy now, we'll all be better off, sooner.

102 2018-01-22 23:47:36 Sr.Manager-Procurement, Exp: Oil & Gas Industry(must)- Posting at HYDERABAD.. Read More here.....
103 2018-01-22 23:47:33 Why then don't we start refining oil here instead of shipping it overseas on tankers and buying Albertan and US made gas and diesel? O you'd shut that down too everything that isn't powered by unicorn farts should be shut down
104 2018-01-22 23:47:24 if they put all the money they'll spend on oil rigs & invest it all into solar panel fields, they'd have more than enough power using the sun then they'd ever need from oil & it keeps replenishing itself, all across America :)
105 2018-01-22 23:47:23 Sorry Arnold, you don't speak for native Californians. Oil or Nuclear, CA needs energy to sustain the population.
106 2018-01-22 23:47:22 Ends up that the idiots at the dealership that i go to for oil changes didn't reset the tire pressure monitors when they did the tire rotation.  SO the actual flat tire was my front right, not back right.
107 2018-01-22 23:47:19 Don't want to make solar affordable when you're invested in oil.
108 2018-01-22 23:46:56 yikes u rly shouldn’t promote coconut oil as a moisturizer. not only is it a SEALANT and not a moisturizer, it clogs pores and in most cases - will cause breakouts.
109 2018-01-22 23:46:55 So my painting professor was showing us past student work and they did an oil self portrait w/ a paper collage background (newspaper, magazine, comics, etc.) and this girl used manga and there was an ahegao face iM wEAK
110 2018-01-22 23:46:46 He’s not propping up an industry by making it more costly, he’s trying to hurt it. See also: National land and oceans open to more drilling. All oil.
111 2018-01-22 23:46:37 It may well be nothing more than a strategy for keeping us dependent on coal and oil, since his #TaxScam does nothing to promote alternative energies, unless I missed something.
112 2018-01-22 23:46:32 a himalayan pink salt and mint bath with hints of almond oil sounds relaxing
113 2018-01-22 23:46:31 Well, we have not seen the end of the #NorthKorea debacle. We need to make #MadeintheUSA a strong brand. I’d like to see barrels of oil supplying Europe and South America #ERMSLegSim
114 2018-01-22 23:46:30 I just bought an essential oil diffuser, my 2018 self-care rebrand is really wild thus far.
115 2018-01-22 23:46:30 Use olive oil as a conditioner by leaving it warmed up on your hair for 15 minutes before shampoo.
116 2018-01-22 23:45:59 @ErnoLaszlo hi any outlets in UK selling the new eye mask please?  Also finding it difficult to source the firmarine precleanse oil in UK. Any advice please?  Loving the detox oil plus sea mud ritual!
117 2018-01-22 23:45:56 accidentally got lavender essential oil in my mouth :/
118 2018-01-22 23:45:48 Drill into Mar-a-Lago. Maybe no oil hut a rich stream of organic fertilizer.
119 2018-01-22 23:45:45 Whale Oil Beef Hooked!
120 2018-01-22 23:45:44 Because people who watch Fox News are more likely to know facts than talk about them?
121 2018-01-22 23:45:26 What does “oilsands supporter” entail? We all like music by Kid Rock? You can learn that much from “oilsands supporter”. What would foreign imported oil supporter like? Britney Spears?
122 2018-01-22 23:45:04 Why don't we make renewable energy our focus, make all cars run on hydrogen and collapse their oil-centric economy?

Russia Exports:
Mineral fuels including oil: US$134.7 billion (47.2% of Total Exports)
Iron, steel: $14.1 billion (4.9%)
Gems, precious metals: $8.9 billion (3.1%)
123 2018-01-22 23:44:51 I don’t understand how some of y’all put coconut oil on your face and don’t break out...
124 2018-01-22 23:44:34 who told y'all to put coconut oil on y'all skin? 
125 2018-01-22 23:44:19 Got it I'm gonna look at their site and get back to you. whats you skin like normally? rough/smooth? low/high oil or moisture?
126 2018-01-22 23:44:18  all hail oil based energy he said
127 2018-01-22 23:44:18 my hands smell like ritual oil
128 2018-01-22 23:44:15 lest someone sue me for libel (see: Colorado oil company & facebook post, which was actually a true statement) let me make it clear that was a joke. As far as I know. Any truth was accidental.
129 2018-01-22 23:44:09 1限消えろ
130 2018-01-22 23:44:06 All Europe has to do is to stop buying Russian oil and gas, and the entire Russian economy would collapse.
131 2018-01-22 23:44:04 Ffs put to much argon oil on my face
132 2018-01-22 23:44:03 The only thing I feel would be appropriate for such a person to advertise is rapeseed oil. #seedyrapist
133 2018-01-22 23:43:58 More inflammatory foods to avoid
>Vegetable oil—Includes margarine, trans fat, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, (EXCEPT olive oil, avocado oil, coconut oil)  
>Commercial pasteurized dairy—(grass fed butter and unpasteurized raw cheese is OK).
134 2018-01-22 23:43:58 it's just awful how they showed the dude putting his hand in hot oil as SOON as you load up netflix. Like the banner on top. It automatically plays the trailer.
135 2018-01-22 23:43:57 This Russia thing is reaching 50s Cold War levels and really makes people look stupid

Russia has a shit ton of its own oil. In what way would Russia benefit from a pipeline here?
136 2018-01-22 23:43:46 Wow! What great picks!  Mask of Magnaminty is a great cleanser to get rid of your pores of debris and to help exfoliate flaky or dry skin with a blend of ground aduki beans, peppermint oil, and kaolin clay.

138 2018-01-22 23:43:45 It's natural gas not oil
139 2018-01-22 23:43:29 Don’t know why people still think coconut oil is healthier that olive oil. Like it’s way worse

145 2018-01-22 23:42:28 @realDonaldTrump You may have just killed 5 people in an oil rig explosion.  But we know you don't feel bad as you only think of yourself.

Can't wait to see how @PressSec Sarah Slanders blames this on Obama, Hillary and the Democrats
146 2018-01-22 23:42:17 yesss coconut oil clogs ur pores
147 2018-01-22 23:42:16 That aid is nothing compared to the wealth of oil in Saudi and Iran.

150 2018-01-22 23:41:46 I’m eating  buttered(olive oil) noodles with (soy)cheese on them and honestly I think I could be dairy free.
151 2018-01-22 23:41:40 Spinach fettuccine with extra virgin olive oil and grated parmigiano cheese was dinner tonight.   Some times I eat what's actually good for me.

153 2018-01-22 23:40:50 Of course. #TraitorTrump is still making kickbacks off coal and oil from his friends and still owns his businesses.

155 2018-01-22 23:40:25 But worse than the Chinese doing their hip-hop cultural appropriation, is what China is doing economically. They already have the most powerful and influential telecommunications network on the continent. Also they are raping the soil for oil. The AU is powerless.

159 2018-01-22 23:40:04 this stuff is out of control. Coal and oil are good but POTUS does not want to help renewable energy. That's the future
160 2018-01-22 23:39:53 bro shilling oil really knock this headache out last night shoutouts to china
161 2018-01-22 23:39:52 It appears E&P massively screwed up rig capital expense, no wonder oil keeps going up
162 2018-01-22 23:39:52 The Mustang had her first oil change and tire rotation today. They also fixed a loose nut in the strut that was causing an extremely annoying noise when I drove over bumps.
163 2018-01-22 23:39:50 GP: Jobs in all sorts of industries stifled by the Obama Adm are making a resurgence due to their confidence in the Trump economy.
Coal mining, steel & oil are on the upswing

164 2018-01-22 23:39:47 Definitely gotta have some THC in there. People always want to use cannabis oil but they are scared of the 'high'. I have seen really positive results from people using a 4:1 CBD:THC mixture to treat their chronic pain anxieties and sleep issues. Not much exp with child epilepsy

168 2018-01-22 23:39:25 The oil and gas companies don't want competition. Renewables are a threat to their keep air dirty policies.

170 2018-01-22 23:38:53 AP you have to pick a side, 2 weeks ago he was bad on solar. Because of oil, now in a move to protect  our products he is bad.
171 2018-01-22 23:38:52 Oil or gas?
172 2018-01-22 23:38:33 Mitch and the truth is like mixing oil and water
173 2018-01-22 23:38:28 I guess when you get State oil income of $100,000 per household, you might afford a bit of “Socialism”. I wonder what would become of their stagnated economy once oil runs out?
174 2018-01-22 23:38:26 Actually I am American in Canada right now working on moving an oil company from up here to North Dakota . So paycheck was. Licked on as cheque which is canadian spelling .. if you looking for a 80000 a year job would be happy to hire you .. gotta love those tax cuts

I heardthat the oil industry got 2 scoops in the desert line.
176 2018-01-22 23:37:53 And oil is the only reason Venezuela had an economy in the first place.

186 2018-01-22 23:37:01 She should be blackmailing oil tycoons, destroying coal refineries, showing herbs as beneficial, and have pam's story be one of using her powers for good, and trying to see her past mistakes and making a positive difference... if allowed.

189 2018-01-22 23:36:29 The loss of democracy, nationalizing opposition companies, sacking PDVSA's management, and sending their oil revenues to other countries to promote their worldview is what destroyed the economy.  That is not socialism.

196 2018-01-22 23:35:43 Who gave Trump oil wells?
197 2018-01-22 23:35:40 Does it mean oil/ gas preferences vs. renewable and more explorations?

210 2018-01-22 23:33:27 The @realDonaldTrump is a dope. Like we're going to use more oil and coal if solar panels cost more. I just don't get this guy. This has nothing to do with @BarackObama ..... #TrumpShutdown #BlueWaveIsComing
211 2018-01-22 23:33:19 Now Hes showing His Idiocracy..Solar increasingly providing more jobs than Coal.
Hes getting paid big money by Gas, Oil and Coal to slow Solar and Renewables.

222 2018-01-22 23:31:47 This is how Trump deters green energy and redirects to oil and fossil fuels.  Coal industry is belly up but green isn't in. Only green he sees is his money because that is how this racist asshole is. Eric already said his pathetic daddy only sees one color and thats green.

227 2018-01-22 23:31:22 Big Oil wins again. President Trump decided today to slap tariffs on imported solar panels. The U.S. will impose duties of as much as 30% on solar equipment made abroad, threatening to handicap a $28 billion industry that relies on parts made abroad for 80% of its supply.

239 2018-01-22 23:30:02 @AdamSerwer I expect it does more to keep other energy sources profitable (oil, LNG, and wind) than make domestic solar more competitive...
240 2018-01-22 23:30:01 Yes a little like oil and water 
241 2018-01-22 23:29:59 You shouldn’t be surprised for a guy who prefers oil and coal over clean energy. POTUS should NOT have this kind of unilateral power - it puts US at the mercy of a class A imbecile with no chance of recovery.

243 2018-01-22 23:29:54 We shouldn't even be importing solar cells, we should be producing them along with wind turbines, but instead let's open all of our coasts for oil drilling and dig up some of that good ol American cleaning burning coal. At least We won't see the sinkholes with breathing masks on
244 2018-01-22 23:29:52 Love how people are bitching about us splashing cash. The fuck they want us to do with the money we make? Put it under Ed Woodwards bed?

256 2018-01-22 23:27:41 @PalmersUK did something change with the ratios of the coconut oil body wash? First 2 bottles were wonderful and smooth and this third bottle is like regular soap..thick, lathery (not coconutty or oily and great like my last couple bottles).

259 2018-01-22 23:27:27 Why is oil over 64.00 plus a barrel for ?
260 2018-01-22 23:27:24 Wrong. By its inaction or feckless ‘sanctions’ the international community has enabled the continued descent into hell in #Venezuela. It’s obvious that the narco state’s lifeline is oil. Why is no one discussing the first, and most obvious pressure point?
261 2018-01-22 23:27:23 well, hello, Trump is owned by Russian oil oligarchs
262 2018-01-22 23:27:19 Foods containing trans fats are primarily in processed foods made with trans fat from partially hydrogenated oil. Bad Cholesterol LDL
263 2018-01-22 23:27:08 I want you to think. Obama gets rid of old cars. Oil rigs have always problems. AI car charging stations all over. It could be a good deal although nothing is brought up to the people but forced. No change brought up to the people. Think.
264 2018-01-22 23:27:02 I think this is another attempt to quash solar here in favor of dirty coal and oil.  Solar panels have gotten very affordable now, so they are scrambling.  #SolarEnergy
265 2018-01-22 23:26:54 You're so blessed! My pores on my nose are awful. Yeah if it does I would definitely try shea butter but coconut oil isn't the worst of them there's def oils that are more comedogenic, just not the best for ppl who breakout easily
266 2018-01-22 23:26:45 Honestly the fact that y’all ever had a trial and error period with coconut oil on your face is the exact explanation for your acne issues

270 2018-01-22 23:26:05 This goes out to his supporters and climate change deniers. Destroy green energy and promote coal and oil.  Let’s not forget destroy the EPA too.  Make America Great Again....but just not for the American people.
271 2018-01-22 23:26:03 Thank god, free speech isn’t limited to those willing to go to combat zones for oil companies. You sit down. Stupid is stupid, combat duty didn’t make you smart, that is for sure.

278 2018-01-22 23:25:23 Trump is interested in personal power and profit, not people and the environment. He'll tout this as protecting coal/oil and dealing with the Chinese subsidizing green energy solutions. 
Sadly, much of his base will lap it up and buy more hats.
279 2018-01-22 23:25:08 @POTUS Makes perfect sense, make solar energy less competitive and increase oil, coal and gas usage.  For washing machines all those people with bonuses and huge tax cuts can spend it on more expensive appliances.
280 2018-01-22 23:25:03 Coal, natural gas, and oil are going to die as energy resources.

Slapping a tariff on solar is not going to change that, only slow it down.

Fossil fuels are energy of the past. Solar is the future.  There's no going back.
281 2018-01-22 23:24:59 Yes ooooo as Federal Government wants to create Cattle colony, Niger Delta Youths Asks FG To Create Oil and Gas Colony oya now.......

290 2018-01-22 23:24:18 Yeah, that was a non-starter. Damascus should have instead deputized SDF Afrin units into the SAA, and demanded SDF withdraw from oil fields east of Deiz ez-Zor

292 2018-01-22 23:23:59 Sorry record consumption in fossil fuel in 2016. US surpassed Saudi Arabia in oil production. Solar is at least 100 years before it does anything.

296 2018-01-22 23:23:17 Have you tried sweet almond oil or avocado oil?
297 2018-01-22 23:23:14 mineral oil is more stable than water for electrical components even if, strictly speaking, it's possible.

AC units work on compression, haha, so it only applies to gaseous fluids
298 2018-01-22 23:23:12 Ok sounds good
299 2018-01-22 23:22:52 It’s like a massage oil for your body! Has CBD and it feels amazing. Relaxes your whole body and if you have any aches, it goes away!
300 2018-01-22 23:22:47 i will do! the cbd oil i just got is nice. but i would like something else too...a bit less expensive as well
301 2018-01-22 23:22:39  STOP YOUR POPULATION AND NO MORE OIL RIGS IN OCEANORDER OF THE GODS THAT INCLUDES YOU ATHEIST
302 2018-01-22 23:22:38 Has somebody found some oil?
303 2018-01-22 23:22:35 I personally have oily skin so don't quote me on this but I've read that jojoba oil works well with dry skin. for acne you could mix the jojoba oil with a drop or two of tea tree oil
304 2018-01-22 23:22:22 30% tariff on solar cells/panels?  Geez...why are we surprised - this is Administration has to remove any threat to their oil & gas interests.
305 2018-01-22 23:22:22 She is so incredibly ignorant and vindictive.  She has no credibility because all she is is the snake oil salesman’s salesman. #SuckabeeSanders

307 2018-01-22 23:22:15 If you put peppermint oil n an extremely hot bath, it will feel like ice water no matter what. It will also leave your skin feeling like ice. But bitch you'll smell good so it's worth it
308 2018-01-22 23:22:14 Stg my waves really spinning rn s/o to that coconut oil got my shits deep 
309 2018-01-22 23:22:04 Just watched Deepwater Horizon, the movie about the BP oil spill, for the first time and I swear I could never image going through such an event. That fact that there are people and companies that put money before their worker’s lives is crazy. Had to shed some tears!
310 2018-01-22 23:21:53 Why use oil? Why not pure water hooked up to an ac unit
311 2018-01-22 23:21:44 did you know that acetone nail polish remover works WONDERS for removing super glue from skin? Also, vegetable oil is great for cutting through tree sap during Xmas time!

314 2018-01-22 23:21:24 By constitution Venezuela CAN'T use the oil reserve as a collateral on any transaction, that will leave the #Petro with out legal floor. I don't believe #Petro will go any where
315 2018-01-22 23:20:52 Just because u get oil funded Arab money owners take over you and few years or success doesn’t make u a big club, Man City atm are a really great but they will never ever be a big clu
316 2018-01-22 23:20:38 they do fishtank builds, but the oil is so gross to work with it's easier to watercool things with tubing (and pumps!) than immersion so it ends up being more of a novelty than a practical measure
317 2018-01-22 23:20:34 That is the reflection of a bankrupt oil industry in a country full of incapable and corrupted individuals within the gov (thugs). Now some OPEC and non-OPEC can capitalize.
318 2018-01-22 23:20:14 I just got excited about having my oil changed. If that doesn’t say “I’m an adult” idk what does.
319 2018-01-22 23:20:14 Lmaooo you might get a heartburn cos no oil.
320 2018-01-22 23:20:06 Sanctioning 7 sicarios out a cast of thousands really doesn’t cut it. Shame shame shame on anyone in EU who acts like this will make a difference. Hit them where it really hurts: how about an oil embargo for starters?
321 2018-01-22 23:19:58 There were several new U.S. startups a few years back. The big oil companies would have none of that. They were forced out of business.
322 2018-01-22 23:19:56 if i see that coconut oil tweet one more time..…
323 2018-01-22 23:19:55 Um we ceded the field of solar to the Chinese by not supporting US manufacturers who could have used a small percentage of what we give to oil companies. That’s on the Republicans. That’s a fact
324 2018-01-22 23:19:52 Your olive oil chocolate mousse barely has time to get cold let alone freeze, but it's a beautiful topping for my rum & rasen ice cream
325 2018-01-22 23:19:51 Oh, also, make your home/workspace extra cozy. Maybe get an oil diffuser. It definitely helps to work and live in a homey space.
326 2018-01-22 23:19:48 I voted for Obama for all the right reasons and he lied to us too. EFCA, mandates, public option, MTR, windfall profits tax on oil, end of war in Afghanistan, lobbyist revolving door, foreclosure moratorium, etc. Perhaps had you called him out, Trump wouldn't be prez.
327 2018-01-22 23:19:44 Family reunion pizza: First, mix 5 tbsp of vanilla extract and 3 litres of olive oil. Garnish with 2 tsp of sake. Finally, saute. Serve chilled. Serves 2.

329 2018-01-22 23:19:28 With Sisi now their investments are increasing, but they've also pumped us with too much money and oil with barely anything in return. We didn't go with them to Yemen, standing with Assad in Syria, with Hashd in Iraq. So I don't know if they like Sisi or not.
330 2018-01-22 23:19:27 Tht growth oil really making my hair long!
331 2018-01-22 23:19:25 Went to get my oil changed & the man there put my name in the computer as “Mattheson” .... that’s a first lol

346 2018-01-22 23:17:35 I understand.But for those who understand about EVs & drive them,it is hard not to be frustrated by 1.Misunderstanding by media that seem to rehash old info of 5-10yrs ago 2.  Vastly incorrect myths from oil & nonEV car manufacturers & “car-experts” who’ve hardly ever driven one!

348 2018-01-22 23:17:20 We should pump up all the oil and shoot it up in the sky to blot out said offensive solar energy.
349 2018-01-22 23:17:00 RT @LeeCamp   IMF estimates we subsidize big oil to the tune of $10 MILLION per MINUTE. If we did that for clean energy, we could switch in no time.
350 2018-01-22 23:16:49 lmao he probably hit an oil rip right after his apology video 
351 2018-01-22 23:16:34 yall rlly put coconut oil on ur FACE??
352 2018-01-22 23:16:22 Yes! I know one woman who makes dream catchers bc she loves culture & enjoys making them, & took the time to research, & she always donates proceeds. Especially during the recent oil pipeline protests. Idk why it’s so hard for ppl to just respect a culture & not use it for money.
353 2018-01-22 23:16:18 Look Leonard,you aren't knowledgeable enough to open your fucking yap about the environment, ie~Calgary and the big scary chinook,that you promptly attributed to global warming. You probably use more oil&gas than a small town. Start riding a bicycle & taking the bus.
354 2018-01-22 23:16:13 Imposing a 30% tariff on solar panels is not only a direct assault on green energy which will cost tens of thousand of US jobs, it's a direct support of the coal and oil industry.
Trump does stuff for personal power and profit reasons, not for people and environment reasons.
355 2018-01-22 23:15:46 I have a very large pot suitable for hot tar or boiling oil, or a seafood gumbo.
356 2018-01-22 23:15:29 First, apples do not kill salmonella on pork, but olive extract and cinnamon oil do (Chen et al., 2013). Apple-derived fiber cuts the fat in meat by 30% (Choi et al., 2016). Apples prevent carcinogens from forming in overcooked meat (Sabally et al., 2016).
357 2018-01-22 23:15:27 @POTUS is destroying American industry in favor of oil and other fossil fuels because he is a fossil and a failed businessman.

359 2018-01-22 23:15:10 Have you even *seen* rapeseed oil crops?  Also, vineyards seem to be universally *pretty* and that has to count for something.
360 2018-01-22 23:15:10 Hi @MakeupJunkieG really enjoyed your show on CH5, just wanted to let you know a form of cannabis/hemp oil (without the THC) called CBD oil is legal in the UK and is used by many people to treat chronic pain, hope this helps :)
361 2018-01-22 23:14:54 "Unión Europea" If you build a new coal plant or oil pipeline today, you have to operate for 30 or 40 years to pay it off. You might think it’s still 10 per cent cheaper to use natural gas than solar plant. Soon it will become a sunk cost or stranded assets, @singularityu
362 2018-01-22 23:14:45 2/ Whether oil or batteries, it is irrelevant. He made science based arguments towards nuclear, what is there to discuss? He is fundamentally right. As for Trump, all the info is vague but he supported him because "he is a businessman like me, and not a politician".
363 2018-01-22 23:14:17 Why wouldn’t he get the solar companies to build here in the states instead of over seas.  Develop healthy competition, get those folks who are out of work back into jobs that will benefit everyone? Perhaps the oil companies have Trump in their back pocket?
364 2018-01-22 23:13:49 Electricity also supplies heat. Heat is also supplied by oil

366 2018-01-22 23:13:46 1/ In the loop now. Jonathan's essay reads as the left's response to Thiel. Don't agree but appreciate it for providing contrast. Not sure about your point on oil as Thiel "focused [his] efforts on new technologies that may create a new space for freedom".
367 2018-01-22 23:13:41 Have you seen anyone using bios or other snake oil to address the nutrient uptake?
368 2018-01-22 23:13:39 His feelings for Adam were an oil spill; he'd let them overflow and now there wasn't a damn place in the ocean that wouldn't catch fire if he dropped a match.
369 2018-01-22 23:13:39 Coconut oil is the secret to everything bro 
370 2018-01-22 23:13:36 That would be so disappointing. I rely on coconut oil to fix all my problems

381 2018-01-22 23:12:53 Let me guess...in keeping with your support of the Drumpf administration, you're gonna allow Zinke to put oil wells along the shore line and in the middle of the Natchez Trace.

391 2018-01-22 23:10:43 Im not anti-Klopp but my standards are much higher and not convinced as of today we are progressing.  Lets judge in May.  If we finish 5th, or 6th, we arent progressing. FSG dont have oil money but they have LOTS LOTS of money they refuse to spend even before the PC sale.

Had honey filled breakfast, had lemon filled lunch, took a bunch of the cough candy, but my throat still feels so dry.
I ate a bit of thyme and olive oil with bread. I should have some more of that >:/
Go away, sickness! Hate you

410 2018-01-22 23:09:07 Castor oil, from what I've heard...
411 2018-01-22 23:09:03 Through the EU, the UK is committed to unlimited Islamic immigration with protection for its customs and mores on pain of prosecution for Hate Crime. All so we can have a deal on cheap oil.
412 2018-01-22 23:08:56 Almost became blind in one eye. My auntie was cooking and she told to check the food and as I look over, the oil pops and nearly hits my eye. Missed it by like 2 cm.
413 2018-01-22 23:08:42 Sure. I’m frustrated like the next supporter, but this is a new team under a new manger which is progressive very nicely. We don’t have oil money backing us either. All we can do is improve and see where that takes us.

418 2018-01-22 23:08:01 its not good to advise people to use it though because its a comedogenic oil but personally ive used it before like just a tad in a face mask and it made my skin kinda oily but nothing major
419 2018-01-22 23:07:55 Cocoa butter is perfect for evening your skin tone and moisturizing your bod period. Me and my baby use the butter, body oil, and face oil by palmers! Wash your face EVERY DAY and you’ll have soft baby skin & rarely break out. To avoid clogged pores, get a toner. 
420 2018-01-22 23:07:50 The major sources of polyphenols are fruits and berries, vegetables, spices, oil seeds and tea. #antiaging #skincare #greenbeauty
421 2018-01-22 23:07:40 Finally got hired for a small gig at an oil company!!! Finally some experience!! On the downside its mainly design work of a simple website :( But a step in the right direction nonetheless!
422 2018-01-22 23:07:37 Imperial oil strongly supports it and they were an industry stake holder in designing the policy so....yeah, I think they are aware.
423 2018-01-22 23:07:29 Best meal plan -if anyone doesn't know where to start: Big bowl of Green Salads with 1 piece of grass fed meat and some coconut oil or ghee.

426 2018-01-22 23:07:12 My man bought me oil, I picked up some pho & we’re bout to watch a movie at home 
427 2018-01-22 23:06:58 Exactly!!  The corruptors keep trying to sell their snake oil.  So sickening......we have been pushed around long enough.  This will be the end of corruption, NO MORE BS, NOT ONE MORE LIE.  As I watched the blabber on the Hill today, I turned the sound OFF.  They are all liars...
428 2018-01-22 23:06:57 Take a look at Wave Killer, we are not up and running, but we could contain a spill and recover the oil.
429 2018-01-22 23:06:47 Sick day so getting an oil change too running some errands omg they asked me to turn the headlights on off left right etc pop the hood I failed everything they all laughed at me
430 2018-01-22 23:06:47 I gotta oil my scalp
431 2018-01-22 23:06:35 Silk Body Cream is great for dry skin and for really really dry skin, some like to layer it on top of Perfumed Dry Oil.

P.D.O. is good for dry skin right out the shower to lock in moisture.
432 2018-01-22 23:06:33 I just bought 102oz of coconut oil for $12 because that is a hell of a sale.

456 2018-01-22 23:04:07 Italian Frisella resembles a crisp doughnut but made from durum wheat - extremely ancient. 1st appeared C10, merchants sailed for months to reach markets. Dried friselle kept for long periods. But too hard to be eaten so they were softened in sea water and dressed w olive oil.

478 2018-01-22 23:01:56 @realDonaldTrump has said that his Interior Secretary should not exempt Florida from offshore oil drilling.  I agree and think Mobil Exxon and BP among others should be invited to put oil drilling rigs 5 miles due east of Mar-a-Lago.

512 2018-01-22 22:58:08 Despite the huge head start that oil has received over the years?  Plus, the externalized costs from burning oil are not factored into the price.  Factor that in and we will see which is cheaper.

The oil industry must go into terminal decline.  Tar sands will be the first to close. Building bitumen pipelines makes no sense. End taxpayer subsidies.. close the sans down and clean them up.

533 2018-01-22 22:55:40 UK has long been a chicken running without a head. It does have financial services & billions of pounds worth of weapons to wahhabist, it was when Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in 2009 rejected an oil pipeline, running through his country from Qatar to Europe, syria was attacked
534 2018-01-22 22:55:39 He was probably instructed to do so after it was revealed that Germany now produces more solar/wind than is needed by whole country.
Can't imagine trump's coal and oil bosses like the idea of that happening.
535 2018-01-22 22:55:38 The reason is to make Trump's oil, gas, and coal buddies happy while simultaneously appearing to "stick it" to China.

552 2018-01-22 22:53:55 Ima play it
553 2018-01-22 22:53:53 This is why cannabis oil needs to be legal  #30inchestallandturning18

555 2018-01-22 22:53:43 more oil in the movie theatre.
556 2018-01-22 22:53:31 Nope. Even with North Sea oil figures taken into account, England still subsidises other parts of the UK - which is fine. Also, with regards to the money from the whiskey industry, that is due to the HQ's being in London and factories in Scotland. I'm happy to educate you all day
557 2018-01-22 22:53:31 Was making this beautifully smelling chickpea noodle soup with freshly chopped veggies in garlic and olive oil. Accidentally added chicken broth instead of veggie. Now I’m sad. Hope the rest of the family likes it.  #vegetarianproblems #fml
558 2018-01-22 22:53:20 30inches and turning 18 @Debbie_abrahams please watch CH5 and bring up subject of medicinal cannabis oil. UK must really move with the times.  Even US has this in some states. Ppl shouldn't suffer unnecessary pain.

567 2018-01-22 22:52:31 It’s illegal to sell suntan oil until after noon on Sunday. (Provincetown, Massachusetts)
568 2018-01-22 22:52:29 #30InchesTallandTurning18 see! Cannabis oil DOES help save lives and get rid of pain more then modern medicine England needs to stop pratting about and make it legal in the UK

571 2018-01-22 22:52:09 Oil that it's not economically viable to extract and will quite likely never be viable to extract.  Due to our "friends" in Arabia opening the floodgates on production.
572 2018-01-22 22:52:09 and that whopping amount of money is why Big Oil fights change so hard and our politicians rake in so much $$ from them to keep the status quo
573 2018-01-22 22:52:07 Ok i know yall (and me) said coconut oil is bad for your skin but i stayed over at my friends house and forgot my moisturiser. she offered me coconut oil, her skin is BOMB btw. my skin was DRY af but after using that my skin was so soft like-
574 2018-01-22 22:52:06 ffs legalise cannabis oil. People SHOULD NOT suffer because of the wanking law's in the UK#30inchesTallandTurning18
575 2018-01-22 22:52:06 clearly this is a wink-wink to his oil buddies! and I was really looking forward to adding solar on our house
576 2018-01-22 22:52:05 You truly are a wonderful, pretty young woman with such a lovely disposition.  You should be so proud of yourself. Btw, you can get CBD oil legally in the UK.  There is a shop near me which sells it.
577 2018-01-22 22:52:03 As tokens so you can screech DIVERSE while continuing permanent war, fracking, oil permits, GMO support, war for oil, pharma, minerals, natural gas, killing those who resist, surveillance state and militarized police, deportations...no, let's destroy this republican lite "party".
578 2018-01-22 22:51:54 if you can get your hands on some CBD oil, use it! it works wonders.

#newsnight
590 2018-01-22 22:50:43 We all know its do with oil and not people.
591 2018-01-22 22:50:38 An oil spill three times larger than Deepwater Horizon, everyone on board dead, and we hear precious little. Not that we're obsessed with ourselves.
592 2018-01-22 22:50:33 30inches and turning 18 UK gov should get medicinal cannabis oil available NOW. Georgia should not have to spend her life in pain when there is a viable proven pain reliever.
593 2018-01-22 22:50:20 Watching #30InchesTall .. Georgia is so lovely, doesn't realise how beautiful she is... but how STUPID is it that we can't get Canabis oil in the UK?! ... it's a bloody plant!!!
594 2018-01-22 22:50:19 I put Covington oil on my big ass lips and they get to screaming for moisture a couple minutes later lol
595 2018-01-22 22:50:16 In Maine we have Homeless,jobless, Hungry,can’t pay for heating oil. The minimum wage cannot support 1 person alone! Politicians and congress/senate You just keep sucking all the money You Greedy mother fuckers
596 2018-01-22 22:50:12 Maytag is out of business, they started making crappy products. Does he think this will bring them back, it won't. he doesn't want solar here in America. he wants oil and coal.....Russia has major investments in oil, hoping to be drilling in the arctic regions here. Deal made
597 2018-01-22 22:50:08 Sorry to hear that!  Yes, this industry of Gas & oil is slowly killing us all!
598 2018-01-22 22:50:08 The pharmaceutical companies must surely be the only reason cannabis oil is not available legally in the uk.  They’d be out of business overnight if people realised the results in pain relief and cancer reducing properties it gives

604 2018-01-22 22:49:34 Coal provides electricity. Oil does not.
605 2018-01-22 22:49:31 So that we buy more oil and gas and then they all get richer! We are not stupid!
606 2018-01-22 22:49:19 Helps his oil and gas buddies, screws states like CA, and raises costs to homeowners/ businesses so they can't save themselves some money (and help the planet).  He's completely unaware of how his childish actions make most Americans lives  worse (or he doesn't care)
607 2018-01-22 22:49:09 @theresa_may could you please make cannabis oil for pain relief legal in this country. You know it makes sense #30inchestall
608 2018-01-22 22:49:06 It is a sheep in T Rex clothing. By imposing tariffs, US solar companies cannot meet demand immediately. Costs for US panels goes up and at year end, Trump will use his idiot in the EPA to cancel solar home rebates. Big Oil wins. US falls behind in air quality. 
Impeach Trump!!
609 2018-01-22 22:49:01 I need an oil change and my car washed

619 2018-01-22 22:47:50 .Iraq War for oil, destabilization of MiddleEast, birth of Isis -- all forgiven & forgotten. How nice!
620 2018-01-22 22:47:36 To be absolutely clear, it is core to the scientific method that absence of proof is not a proof of absence. To demand that IARC, having not found that coffee can cause cancer, treat this as proof that it can't is exactly the pseudo-science garbage we know from tobacco and oil.
621 2018-01-22 22:47:17 If you go deep into the report the oil isnt the WARNING, the warning is what could be done on the back of it, currency, investment, trade - leading to a Scots economy today along the lines of Norway except WEALTHIER as they didnt do a soverign wealth fund until 90s.
622 2018-01-22 22:47:17 The guy at jiffy lube just told me I need to use my sexy voice when asking for an oil change because “it’s a very exiting thing to have done”

I don’t get it
623 2018-01-22 22:47:04 The stupid greed runs deep with his oil buddies.
624 2018-01-22 22:46:46 Until the electric cars become a American house hold name. When all American's have them. My guess oil won't be in demand.

632 2018-01-22 22:46:23 Hi Ewan, because it is refined & chemically treated and oxidises easily. Pure extra virgin olive oil is a lot healthier
633 2018-01-22 22:46:13 Has she tried Cannibis oil, Brian. I've heard good things about it.
634 2018-01-22 22:46:02 I've googled recipes in the past and it is so confusing, they all use different ratios of flour/egg. This time though an Italian told me - always 100g of flour per egg used. Also a pinch of salt a few a dash of olive oil. It's made my best yet.
635 2018-01-22 22:45:56 i hear what y'all saying about coconut oil, but my skin really loves that stuff.
636 2018-01-22 22:45:54 So coal and oil cronies of @realDonaldTrump are rewarded...I hope this back fires all over them.  If it smells this bad now,  won't smell any better later!
637 2018-01-22 22:45:53 So the value of the the pacific coast is greater than the value of other coasts?! Or we shouldn’t drill for oil off any coast?! Oil is a necessity we all use and I’m pretty sure you use more than the average person.
638 2018-01-22 22:45:35 @JasonGregor @Jason_Strudwick Does the fact that the Oil have extensive history of nepotism taint your opinion in this at all?  All this "If  Oil hired Bourque?" or "Ducks with Niedermayer" talk is irrelevant due to their lack of history with same bias with giant turd results.
639 2018-01-22 22:45:34 Once again he's trying to go back in time. Almost every other country on earth is going the renewable energy route. 
But if the us stays with oil and coal what are they going to fight their wars over?
640 2018-01-22 22:45:32 PS: Oil is NOT = petrol.
Nonetheless, i get the intent of your opinion.
641 2018-01-22 22:45:28 Can't believe Olive oil or antiperspirants are given out on prescription, each prescription costs the #NHS a fortune
642 2018-01-22 22:45:25 The ratio of iso-pentane to n-pentate is an indicator of the type of emission source of VOCs. Ratios below 1.5 are indicators of oil & gas activity; other sources are much higher, in the range of 2 or 3. #ucarlive
643 2018-01-22 22:45:13 Left for years was anti-immigration because it hurt labor while right was against immigration because they did not like immigrants.  Good argument to be made that the snake oil Bernie Sanders sold on trade in primaries and then repeated by Trump in general is what moved OH/PA etc

658 2018-01-22 22:43:53 It’s a blow to anyone wanting solar panels. Asia is so far ahead of us technologically; they look like the Jetsons and we’re the Flinstones.

THIS makes it difficult to get solar for AMERICANS and keeps us dependent on the system.

This is a move for big oil.
659 2018-01-22 22:43:30 Has anyone suggested Cannibis Oil. I've heard it does wonders with cancer, even stage four.
660 2018-01-22 22:43:24 Fair enough. I’ve taken your point on board as well. There is a lot of facts around Trump’s promotion of fossil fuels: resumption of drilling for oil off the coast of the US etc etc
661 2018-01-22 22:43:16 I love the way you say oil 
662 2018-01-22 22:43:11 Over time. Probably take over 20 years. National debt less than 1 trillion when Reagan became President.  Read IMF Externalities on net. Welfare to corporate welfare queens in trillions of dollars a year.  Increase taxes and fines on banks, oil, coal, etc causing harm get surplus
663 2018-01-22 22:43:10 Iranians need to rise up now when regime is bankrupt before oil comes back up and replenishes regimes' coffers.
664 2018-01-22 22:43:09 Yes, & coconut oil 
665 2018-01-22 22:43:08 おめでとう！
666 2018-01-22 22:42:59 Good time to put air in my tires. Even change my oil 
667 2018-01-22 22:42:56 i could not change the oil or build a deck -- tho i have done both things in the past -- without a lot of advice from the internet.
668 2018-01-22 22:42:52 So, Americans will have to pay MORE in order to reduce their energy costs and dependence on oil? Saw that Trump move coming.
669 2018-01-22 22:42:37 Wings look great,hope you can give a tutorial on how you did them.Maybe the carapace a dark green with a couple of nuln oil washes?
670 2018-01-22 22:42:31 That will not "bring back coal". Just makes his oil baron buddies happy with less competition 
671 2018-01-22 22:42:28 It happened one day
I saw him on the OCTranspo  
He looked at me but I looked away 
I mentioned which product he used to get his curls so curly 
You know being me 
Then all the sudden it was my stop 
But before I got off 
He said" Castor Oil" 
That's when I knew

677 2018-01-22 22:41:52 If FIRS truly generated N4 trillion excluding revenue from crude oil sales out of a N7 trillion budget, why do we need to borrow heavily to finance the budget ?
something is not adding up.

685 2018-01-22 22:40:47 Pesto is is mostly pine nuts and garlic, basil and cheese with EVOO. Whereas Italian salsa verde is parsley, olive oil, capers, anchovies, vinegar, lemon juice, garlic, and lemon zest.

715 2018-01-22 22:38:30 Have to keep those filthy oil prices sky high. Hey @realDonaldTrump, your actions are transparent. We know what your game is . . . nitwit. (Yes, I cleaned up what I was going to say . . . use your imagination).
716 2018-01-22 22:38:29 Usually if I am struggling, which is rare, Jamie, I am a mum; I use lavender oil, BUT! will defo put them on my shopping list this week. If I don't sleep like a baby though-you'll be hearing from me. LOL Terrie. ps loving food fight with you and Jimmy.
717 2018-01-22 22:38:20 His ambition is to kill US solar altogether. His backers are Nuclear, Oil, Gas and Coal generation stock holders.
718 2018-01-22 22:37:52 Its the essence all about matt  oil control paper. They don't say in the packaging what it is made of. It could be hemp or rice paper or another type.
719 2018-01-22 22:37:48 If I don't have a carrier oil to dilute it with I'll put a few drops on a washcloth and bring it in a steam shower with me and hang it close to my face.... kinda the same effect lol. Gotta do what you gotta do. 
720 2018-01-22 22:37:47 In Trump’s world the only energy allowed is coal and oil.  Welcome to the 1970’s all over again. He’d love to kill of the EPA and all our environment laws.
721 2018-01-22 22:37:35 I see it as akin to changing your oil or (perhaps more like) building a deck. You might not be a pro, but it can’t hurt to have the basic skill.
722 2018-01-22 22:37:25 A question. ..how come your oil rich brother muslims don't aid you...why are we expected to?
723 2018-01-22 22:37:24 My ppl d tym whr u win ppl's hrt wit salt nd rice has gone into xtinction.  We have to let our ppl know their rights. I will speak my dialect 2 my ppl. Enough is Enough. We are not Esau and we won't sell our birth right for rice palm oil nd Maggi. I raise my REDCARD O.

734 2018-01-22 22:36:17 If you take a trip to La Bufadora, they sell all sorts of crazy oil paintings. It’s a water spout tourist place. We had a sketchy cab ride there and back.
735 2018-01-22 22:36:13 関東大雪で交通機関麻痺してるとこもあるのに、雪なんて積もってないわい通常出勤(　˙-˙　)

736 2018-01-22 22:36:11 Don't do coconut oil on your face babe 
737 2018-01-22 22:36:06 Keep selling your snake oil Chuck. You can’t possibly support Trump and have any credibility to understanding what the truth is. He is the king of lying.
738 2018-01-22 22:36:03 You know when you take a bath and then start to sweat in the hot ass bath and I put coconut oil in the water so I'm basically melting.

741 2018-01-22 22:35:57 Ugh I need an oil change before Friday
742 2018-01-22 22:35:56 @realDonaldTrump did U even read who owns the “American made” solar panel companies.  Pull ur head out of ur ass and read something other than Twitter.  Real jobs will be lost over this because of your blind trust in the oil conglomerates and stupidity.
743 2018-01-22 22:35:50 Oh ok so your oil is breaking down the foundation. Idk what to suggest that’s cheap other then the fit me one. :/ maybe try the new superstay one from Maybelline. It used to be my cult fav a few years ago before the discontinued it and now its back out!
744 2018-01-22 22:35:48 Went one day without my coconut oil and I feel like I’m going insane 
745 2018-01-22 22:35:37 As he harms green energy, he’ll use that to claim support for coal and oil. 

He’s always of a mind set for personal benefit over people benefits.
746 2018-01-22 22:35:29 Trump will make more money on coal, nuclear power plants, uranium mining, oil, gas etc than he would with solar energy.  Secret kickbacks cha-ching in his own pockets
747 2018-01-22 22:35:27 Such type of Rascals shouuld be fried in boiling oil.
748 2018-01-22 22:35:23 absolutely!#FullDisclosure I'd also accept diamonds, crowns + oil; can never get enuf of those  #DomiNations life is rough
749 2018-01-22 22:35:13 They will do anything to help the big oil welfare recipients.
750 2018-01-22 22:35:06 RT @LivingSafely: Frito Lay's #Cheetos this January? Its top three ingredients are corn meal, vegetable oil and cheese seasoning.
751 2018-01-22 22:34:50 Eh Hem... Sorry for interrupting, but we’re back with the new engine and transmission. As well as fresh oil and transmission fluid for Dani.

753 2018-01-22 22:34:28 Yup anything for oil
754 2018-01-22 22:34:23 It’s all PR. Keep turning a blind eye to it as long as they pour oil money in though eh mate. 
Nope, not won it since Fergie claimed title number 20 in his last season. It’s been hard to see you win it every season since then though. Oh, hang on a minute...

758 2018-01-22 22:34:11 I dilute it with a carrier oil and massage it on my temples and the nape of my neck! It doesn't take the pain away but it definitely gives me relief.
759 2018-01-22 22:33:59 Most people don't have time or don't know how to change their oil.
760 2018-01-22 22:33:56 How solar boom helps india, currently energy from Renewable is 1% and scope exist to expand. Oil consumption is 215 Mil tone with 196 Mil tone imported. Net import of oil & gas is 4% of GDP and 2.5% above account deficit... So in house solar helps indian GDP, Deficit, rating etc.
761 2018-01-22 22:33:24 You use the pure oil?
762 2018-01-22 22:33:03 <<< big believer in juicing .. fresh organic and herbs and high quality CBD oil
763 2018-01-22 22:32:20 So don't buy gas for your car because it benefits the big oil companies, etc. Try offering something constructive if you're going to use Twitter.
764 2018-01-22 22:32:19 I’m about to do my oil change high as fuck 
765 2018-01-22 22:32:17 I rlly thought it was just me that was not a fan of straight coconut oil 
766 2018-01-22 22:32:05 He has to make sure it’s more costly for Americans to have solar power over oil. He has to take care of his oil buddies like the Koch brothers, Exxon, etc. and all the rest of his campaign doners. This entire presidency is about the top 1% of this country making more money.

769 2018-01-22 22:31:50 You and the others out numbered by steam here. Just as steam is out numbered by diesels. That’s why I’m here. He didn’t care for Ferdinand and the twins way back when and even when they returned. They run on oil just as you and the others. That’s why I opened the works on-
770 2018-01-22 22:31:42 Fried in olive oil. Have you tried them? Amazingly good.
771 2018-01-22 22:31:36 Came in for an oil change. Somehow I ended up with hella other shit . Its like sending your girl to Walmart on a 5 minute trip and she comeback 2 hours later with unnecessary shit.

It was singing to me all of the way home.. nice and shiny now, so apologies for the upcoming weather.
777 2018-01-22 22:30:52 anybody who puts coconut oil on their face gotta go to jail right now
778 2018-01-22 22:30:40 No panels made in the US. All are subject to this. Pandering to oil and coal.

784 2018-01-22 22:30:18 rejuvenated oil heater makes you tipsy
785 2018-01-22 22:29:56 Nowadays lotion doesn’t work for my skin, only oil does.
786 2018-01-22 22:29:52 Fake news in any show with a defense contractor or oil company as comercial sponsors
787 2018-01-22 22:29:50 I love when I get an oil change and pretend to know what the guy is talking about when shows me the little stick thing with the oil marker.
788 2018-01-22 22:29:46 I think from what I've seen (like the graph above) any increase in protein = a decrease in oil, so I don't know if there's a sweet spot like there is (supposedly) in wheat.
789 2018-01-22 22:29:46 coconut oil really be having my face glowing .
790 2018-01-22 22:29:41 coconut oil is the best thing ever fuckin should get an award for its versatility, hair??? Skin??? Cookin??
791 2018-01-22 22:29:32 It's actually the beginning of a review of our curriculum. I am setting out how we want the curriculum to develop. Am just making a point about prevalence of snake oil in education and that we want the curriculum to be informed by evidence.
792 2018-01-22 22:29:29 What to use in Lieu of Pesticides? Neem Oil, Garlic & Clove Oil, Azatrol, StrawFlower Extract... the list goes on!
793 2018-01-22 22:29:24 None of this is relevant to how the IRA operated. You're clearly well read but you're attempting to conflate physical force republicanism with non violent peaceful protest. Like mixing oil and water.
794 2018-01-22 22:29:17 Did you tell them how you're allowing mining and oil cos to destroy the bears homes?
795 2018-01-22 22:29:16 Not at all my face is like the BP oil spill
796 2018-01-22 22:29:14 million-dollar business idea: if someone found a way to package beef oil as a hand cream but made it smell less like hamburger
797 2018-01-22 22:29:13 mix rose water, lemon, and brown sugar to scrub them keep them pink, then I use lemon oil to moisturize them 
798 2018-01-22 22:29:09 Still trying to figure out why being a club with history and prestige is looked down on these days, yet being an oil money merchant of a club is something to be proud of, baffles me
799 2018-01-22 22:29:03 Car was fine. Got an oil change at @Valvoline and now my car is making a very loud sound at 60mph and slightly shaking.
800 2018-01-22 22:28:53 When will you release the water powered engine that you bought in the 70’s and locked away due to your business being in cahoots with the oil firms and petrochemical industry?
801 2018-01-22 22:28:51 Their are cures all around us from cannabis oil to ginger curing cancer. But the big pharmas don't want the populous knowing this their is no money in the cure.
802 2018-01-22 22:28:49 Yes but Niger has oil
803 2018-01-22 22:28:47 Can’t find castor oil anywhere. Wtf
804 2018-01-22 22:28:45 Duh..greedy bastards, everytime the price of oil went up, their budget went up, now in these fickle times, they're at an impasse on what to do,  leave the PFD alone, and go after the politicians, shake them down for over charging for "their services"
805 2018-01-22 22:28:39 And the garnier oil infused micellar water wtf it literally takes my makeup off in seconds, big up @garnier 
806 2018-01-22 22:28:36 Monday’s are for errands I guess. Oil changed and got my bulbs for my license plate lights since I got pulled over for that bs. Now to attempt to replace them
807 2018-01-22 22:28:36 Protecting his big oil donors.
808 2018-01-22 22:28:30 Don't understand #MAGA ts & how desperately they want 1. to waste what little Trump isnt giving away to all his rich buddies on a stupid freakin wall that wont work anyway & 2. Believe world's most obvious snake oil salesman with a reputation for lying, cheating & conning others
809 2018-01-22 22:28:28 This Hemp Oil on these #NaturalCurls though
810 2018-01-22 22:28:07 I was talking on the phone VERY QUIETLY waiting to get my car’s oil changed and an old man got up and moved and gave me a death stare. I apologized and smiled. His reply: A DEEPER DEATH STARE. Has all kindness vanished these days?
811 2018-01-22 22:28:06 1. Seize oil fields for the people? Theft.
2. Eminent domain bank owned houses given to homeless? Theft.
3. Wipe out student debt? Theft. 
4. I don't want Medicare for All, I want a combo of ACA, expanded Medicaid, private insurance.
5. Regulate banks.

We're not communists.
812 2018-01-22 22:28:06 I needed an oil change 300 miles ago, my car making noises I can’t afford to fix AND my gas light just came on
813 2018-01-22 22:28:04 Also fab for shine is the Moroccan Oil brand....but can be a little heavy if your hair is prone to oiliness. You’ll know your hair better after a month of reconstructing! 
814 2018-01-22 22:27:57 @realDonaldTrump & his big oil buddies! Let’s keep Amer moving backwards with @gop @realDonaldTrump administration!
815 2018-01-22 22:27:55 Coconut oil helped clear my face an I had bad acne
816 2018-01-22 22:27:55 Them hoes put Transmission fluid in my car instead of oil 
817 2018-01-22 22:27:45 Mrs. Daps: Diba pag magkaon mo tapos oily inyong ge kaon unya di baya masagol ang Oil ug water so unsaon man ninyo inyong plato ana?

Andrew: Butangan ug Joy ma'am kay mao man ang ingon ni Bitoy

Heh pagkakyut na oyot oy HAHAHAHA
818 2018-01-22 22:27:27 I guess he has to keep his promises to the 85 coal miners left in this country and all his oil and gas donors by stunting an industry that is actually growing. We just keep winning with this ass hat as president, don't we?
819 2018-01-22 22:27:18 Trump and his pals make money off of oil. What a bunch of scum bags.
820 2018-01-22 22:27:12 Vacation: Day 1 -- lithium grease and mineral oil. #iknowhowtoparty
821 2018-01-22 22:27:06 All about $$$ and oil. 
Screw Mother Earth, our kids don't need her.
Oh wait...
822 2018-01-22 22:27:05 That Chevelle has been restored just the way I like em, Firebird is nice too. I almost bought a used Firebird back in the 70's. Took it for a hard test spin, opened the hood and oil was pouring out of the gasket on the valve covers.
823 2018-01-22 22:26:54 This made me remember something @ShoutsAndMiras said: "When you're producing for the masses, never underestimate their capacity to stop buying and instead just eat yam and oil 
824 2018-01-22 22:26:47 Let's not forget he does not want clean anything. Oil and gas lobby has a big say. Remember all those oil drilling sites they want off the coast, in Alaska and the Arctic?
825 2018-01-22 22:26:45 I don't have a diffuser but I love peppermint oil, I use it for my migraines.
826 2018-01-22 22:26:44 Betwee coconut water and peppermint oil, I think I can fix 95% of ailments 
827 2018-01-22 22:26:41 "oh, and truffle oil, lots of truffle oil. Like two, three litres."

DO YOU WANT ME TO FAIL THIS EXAM OR WHAT!!!!
828 2018-01-22 22:26:36 those countries are still dependant on oil #hopes are in renewables like the leader is #Germany whom we #envy but the reason that they are the #Leader is because they have to be they have hardly any fossil fuels of their own and do not use #Nuclear no other #option for #energy
829 2018-01-22 22:26:33 My mother in law is no oil painting...
More of an oil tanker!
830 2018-01-22 22:26:33 Covering myself in coconut oil before bed is my new thing 
831 2018-01-22 22:26:27 Reduce corruption in Congress - State Legislatures should pass laws banning members of Congress from ever working for banks, prescription drugs, oil, coal, cable, electricity after leaving office.
832 2018-01-22 22:26:26 It's been a while since our last #Quiz! 
Which country has the second biggest #oil reserves in the world?
833 2018-01-22 22:26:20 SHOCKING NEWS that at times I forget is that this house in order to preserve it was made into a RIGG which at times produces its own sediment of oil freeze brin
834 2018-01-22 22:26:09 All for the big oil donors and Putin of course
835 2018-01-22 22:26:08 Chump why did you pick Solar Panels instead of Oil to put a tax on? Did the big oil money donors demanded it. I think this is going to be very damaging to our solar industry. 30% is freaking huge.
836 2018-01-22 22:26:02 Prayers out to those in Oklahoma on oil Derek Patterson 219. Still 5 rig hands missing 
837 2018-01-22 22:25:58 If anyone reading this juuls. Have you guys tried CBD oil in your pods. If so dm me about it.
838 2018-01-22 22:25:39 Matt was like fry the chicken. So I was like ok. Heated the oil, put the chicken in and got hit in the face with with a little hot oil. *cries* That shit hurt.
839 2018-01-22 22:25:34 the @BahiCosmetics sunflower serum that's an oil is supposed to be life changing for the face!
840 2018-01-22 22:25:22 Covered head to toe in bio oil and I feel like I’ve just took a dip in a deep fat fryer
841 2018-01-22 22:25:22 Like the Oil Changes, Apple Car Play should be Complimentary for 3 Years.
842 2018-01-22 22:25:02 Wait til she says “oil” then lol   love u @Laura88Lee
843 2018-01-22 22:25:00 Ironic to talk about money when your club wouldn’t even be in the top flight without oil money.
844 2018-01-22 22:24:59 ขอบคุณบ้านหลังนี้นะครับ ที่ให้ผมซ่อนตัว อยู่ตั้งหลายๆเดือน ผมมีความสุขมาก
845 2018-01-22 22:24:46 coconut oil really isn't a godsend like people claim it to be, i've been saying this!
846 2018-01-22 22:24:12 The drive to oil.
847 2018-01-22 22:24:10 EPIC grape juice olive oil victorias secret perfume i love josh is so cute my wounds hoyl shit fuck is sooo beautiful im
848 2018-01-22 22:24:10 And there is a 30% rebate on heating oil ?
849 2018-01-22 22:24:09 Yeah, clean coal, shale oil, nat gas, and so much drilling activity
850 2018-01-22 22:24:04 Waiting for these people to be like "your car has a sludge problem" I know. Please just change my oil until I can afford to get it cleared out lmao
851 2018-01-22 22:24:01 All things being equal I buy @Lucas_Oil product because I see them at many events I attend.
852 2018-01-22 22:24:00 Yep, although the last 2.5 hours were basically oil wells and red dirt cotton fields.
853 2018-01-22 22:23:49 Yes, Trump's solar tariff decision could've been worse. But it's still really bad - it'll slow the clean energy revolution & in short term will cost thousands of US jobs.

If Trump were serious about jobs, he'd shift some of the massive oil, gas, & coal handouts to renewables.
854 2018-01-22 22:23:43 Plus another $50/mo for an oil change, and $600 every 16 months for tires.
855 2018-01-22 22:23:42 I’m obsessed with bio oil 
856 2018-01-22 22:23:39 Is it a coincidence that #POTUS who does not believe #ClimateChangeIsReal and is loyal to the oil and gas lobby should have slapped trade tariffs on solar products as his first foray n2 protectionism? Nope.
857 2018-01-22 22:23:29 Damnn! I just get rashes with everything man I hate it! But I loooove coconut oil on my body so that’s all good then
858 2018-01-22 22:23:11 My love, you're an inspiration, and from someone who suffers pain, too, thank you for raising awareness for something that's invisible. If I may, something that's helped me is CBD Oil from CBD Brothers...might just be worth checking it out. Good luck and special wishes. 
859 2018-01-22 22:23:08 has visto la nueva criptomoneda oil coin?
860 2018-01-22 22:23:05 I am at a credit union. I like it better because I know it isn’t directly funding things I disagree with (oil pipelines etc.) and because they invest in our local community.
861 2018-01-22 22:22:57 "Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord." -James 5:14 ESVJesus still works miracles in the body of believers today!

863 2018-01-22 22:22:39 Coconut oil as moisturizer only works if your natural skin is already 85% there.
864 2018-01-22 22:22:18 Some pipo are shaking instead of looking for Jamaican black castor oil
865 2018-01-22 22:22:16 I keep forgetting with this car I can’t go to these damn Jiffy lube’s to get a oil change. This oil cost too much.
866 2018-01-22 22:22:16 Need to start adding more oil treatments to mine, been so dry lately! @beianany @TeliaKorrine

868 2018-01-22 22:21:55 Yeah, keep your science fictiony solar powered contraptions out of our beautiful coal and oil driven nation!! 
We don’t want you profiting from technology of which we refused to transition over to. America Last - and polluted - like we always intended 
869 2018-01-22 22:21:54 Eating well & developing skills of how not to leave it in your beard,I think a quality beard wash is very important! I use oil everyday but only balm usually twice a week as I find it heavy. I did a yeard for charity & it was a beast
870 2018-01-22 22:21:39 Idea! Onion and a bit of garlic with some green pepper in a bit of hot oil without burning, lightly fry the rabbit and then add some tomato sauce and salt. Enjoy!
871 2018-01-22 22:21:34 Right, because getting solar panels from Chinese workers making $3.65/hr is the 'right' way for rich Americans to get off of oil and onto solar power....
872 2018-01-22 22:21:26 I went to Chester Zoo a few months back. Signs warning about the perils of palm oil everywhere, then I went to the zoo cafe and the sandwich and cake I had were both made with palm oil. Not ideal!

876 2018-01-22 22:21:00 Body is fine, but on the face is a big no no. My skin is sensitive too, I used coconut oil once on my face as well. NEVER AGAIN! I had dry red patches the next day xx

894 2018-01-22 22:18:42 Why are you proud of this? You should be ashamed. Selling your soul and our environment to big oil is not something to be proud of. You should be ashamed. The people of Alaska will not forget.

900 2018-01-22 22:17:49 I'm shook? Coconut oil literally healed my sons eczema ?
901 2018-01-22 22:17:40 It’s the oil industry that will be going into anaphylactic shock!

907 2018-01-22 22:16:09 So i had a headache last night and i my stupid self didnt take any panadol. I woke up at like 3am and the headache was worse LOL. I grabbed the medicinal oil from my piano which acts as nightstand and i accidently spilled the oil into my eye while i was uncapping it
908 2018-01-22 22:16:08 this is a great thread! i bought beyond meat "chicken strips" for lunches this week instead of chicken and cooked everything w olive oil instead of butter, so vegan lunches! i am proud of myself lol
909 2018-01-22 22:16:04 They make the chicken, the nuggets, the fries, etc in the same oil. That black oil is impossible to forget...
910 2018-01-22 22:15:57 But oil also is kind and selfless
911 2018-01-22 22:15:51 COCONUT OIL IS BAD FOR YOUR SKIN. DON'T EVER TELL ME TO PUT COCONUT OIL ON MY DRY SKIN, HOW DARE YOU!
912 2018-01-22 22:15:49 Yeah really good. This foundation is oil free and gives a skin like look. I love it! 
913 2018-01-22 22:15:47 it sounds weird, but oils might help. Something like almond oil... I started using olive oil to deal with my (v thick) hair when it's dry and gets really poofy
914 2018-01-22 22:15:44 I use buffet, the azelic acid, the vitamin c suspension and the rosehip oil.

916 2018-01-22 22:15:36 I tried putting coconut oil in my coffee today, can't say I'm a fan. Feels like I'm drinking diluted vaseline. My lips feel fantastic though.
917 2018-01-22 22:15:34 Yes its white oil
918 2018-01-22 22:15:32 @sainsburys please can you use olive oil instead of rapeseed oil in your huomous
919 2018-01-22 22:15:18 If would affect his oil $$ residuals.
920 2018-01-22 22:15:18 Guess who just changed her own oil
921 2018-01-22 22:15:16 # CAN ANYONE PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME IF AMERICA IS THE LEADING OIL PRODUCERS' IN THE WORLD AND WITH THE EXTRAS OIL STORAGES'. WHY IS OUR GAS PRICES RISING??
WITH ALL THE FIGHTING WERE GETTING SCREWED
922 2018-01-22 22:15:16 1/2 Bill you are so far off point, I don’t even know where to start, try reading some of my tweets & retweets. The clue is there. I’m sure I could dig out the security photos of me covered head to toe in Scotland’s oil stickers when I knocked doors for Gordon Wilson in 74.
923 2018-01-22 22:15:14 Soak my hair in organic coconut oil and chill
924 2018-01-22 22:15:10 Do people use those oil pens in sa like they do in Ca?
925 2018-01-22 22:14:42 Cold pressed linseed oil – oil often used in the grinding process of oil paints, the oil is extracted from Flaxseed, without the use of heat. The process takes longer than extracting using heat but is a purer oil.
926 2018-01-22 22:14:35 The lemon and herbs diffuser combined with the scent coming from the stupid coconut oil supersoft toilette paper (was a new product I had to buy it) are making my bathroom smell of แกงเขียวหวาน or Thai Green Curry. This is not good.
927 2018-01-22 22:14:24 There are outright lies in it, so, don’t worry. Ie McDonalds switched from beef tallow to vegetable oil in the 90s, but PETA (whose blog which contains no citation itself) still thinks they use tallow.
928 2018-01-22 22:14:11 Hey that’s a nice ph-hooooly shit this man is a god at oil painting.
929 2018-01-22 22:14:11 Sooo bad for your face! At first I thought you meant @tiffromthe6 used coconut oil on her face I was like nooo
930 2018-01-22 22:14:09 Grow hair mainly and soften it, I'm torn between the coconut and mint oil and the avocado one...do they work well together? xx
931 2018-01-22 22:14:08 They're the best. Also see an air fryer. It fries food with convection heat. No oil needed.
932 2018-01-22 22:14:05 Had to make a new page Edgar got hacked hope you have been well. I know you are still burning the midnight oil. @EdgarSFields1
933 2018-01-22 22:13:58 I’m pretty sure castor oil & jojoba oil are both really good and help stimulate hair growth !
934 2018-01-22 22:13:52 I swear by sunflower and sweet almond oil...
935 2018-01-22 22:13:44 Are you warming the oil?
936 2018-01-22 22:13:44 Yes, but it’s was all heart from a team that will go down, not money from oil ,sorry I can’t stop laughing 
937 2018-01-22 22:13:32 Drying oils: oils such as Linseed oil, Walnut oil and Poppy oil that have the chemical properties of creating a solid, elastic surface when exposed to air (oxidization). Non-drying oils – unsuitable for oil painting are Olive oil and Almond oil.
938 2018-01-22 22:13:29 A Dance Party called Boogie Circle where you massage beards with coconut oil while eating vegan bacon
939 2018-01-22 22:13:20 After nearly 3 decades, I'm used to this shit. We've had the odd highlights but we ain't no oil barrens or crooked Ruskis, so we'll have to be content with being also rans. 4th place ? I wanna celebrate something meaningful.
940 2018-01-22 22:13:19 he doesnt have the men to occupy it and Sarin is definitively off the menu. Plus part of any deal would be SDF dont disarm. Allow his a few army posts in big cities, like In Hasakah. Export the oil from Deir via the state company etc etc
941 2018-01-22 22:13:13 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
942 2018-01-22 22:13:11 Lolz... Calm down. Alexis isn't worth that considering his age and his present contract. Bring this to the table for a 22-24yr old and see if the oil money is there or not, Pep style is to keep his team fresh and young. Go through his Barça and Bayern team.

944 2018-01-22 22:13:05 Was about to order MCT oil, or so I thought. It was coconut oil for HAIR.
945 2018-01-22 22:12:55 Its a supplement to their dry.  I ran out of characters.  In the past I have crushed up dog vitamins and mixed in.  Often I will squirt a fish oil capsule over their dry food.
946 2018-01-22 22:12:54 Yo Lorne - But, gov't subsidies to oil companies are downright capitalistic, right?
947 2018-01-22 22:12:41 If you guys go to Ensanada...get me a Joseph Smith oil painting. It’s right next to the Tupac’s.
948 2018-01-22 22:12:40 I’d Rather Use Coconut Oil For Everything
949 2018-01-22 22:12:37 I will help oil the springs
950 2018-01-22 22:12:33 And as you make and fight these wars the world is becoming more unstable..18 years in Afghanistan and still no results. 
More and more civilians killed each day in pursuit of oil and control of the middle East. Isis still exists and will continue to exist and grow.
951 2018-01-22 22:12:27 Maybe there is a different mentality in the UK Oil and Gas sector then. If you ask the really old guys (who are missing 2-3 fingers) then maybe they'd agree. People my age (40s) just want to get home safe to their families. In my opinion too much is better than too little.
952 2018-01-22 22:12:21 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
953 2018-01-22 22:12:13 House resources, first slide, Flaws in current oil tax system.
954 2018-01-22 22:11:51 Indeed it varies state by state (I’m in NM, the oil&gas-backed governor of which pushed the legislature to get rid of residential solar incentives last year).
955 2018-01-22 22:11:41 I have no coconut oil. I’m living like an animal
956 2018-01-22 22:11:31 Obama & many in his adm said they wanted to accomplish this by targeting these companies to push their anti-coal & oil platform.
Seems like a few more regulations are now on the chopping block
@realDonaldTrump - here's another onerous reg most would agree can be nixed.

959 2018-01-22 22:11:08 will help keep oil prices high, and therefore Rex & Vlad happy 
960 2018-01-22 22:10:57 Coconut oil is my best friend 
961 2018-01-22 22:10:46 I have no idea if this is good or bad but I have ZERO confidence it was done for the right reasons.
1-I thought he only liked oil & gas
2-How is he or Kushner tied to the companies requesting tarriffs.
3-What will China do in response and how many Americans will lose jobs
962 2018-01-22 22:10:36 
963 2018-01-22 22:10:31 I couldn’t recognize myself after using coconut oil for like a month. Was badly breaking out,skin was peeling off
964 2018-01-22 22:10:17 Please explain then. He doesn't support alternative energy and won't help the industry,  It just means they will start drilling for oil off of all our coastlines. How is that a good thing?

966 2018-01-22 22:10:09 RT @LivingSafely: Frito Lay's #Cheetos this January? Its top three ingredients are corn meal, vegetable oil and cheese seasoning.

968 2018-01-22 22:09:17 Forgot about the @Purolator oil filter I bought a couple weeks ago. 
969 2018-01-22 22:09:07 Binder – the substance mixed with the dry pigment which holds together (binds) the pigment colour and helps the paint to stick to the support. For oil paint, the binder is usually cold-pressed Linseed oil.
970 2018-01-22 22:09:01 How convenient for his oil industry buddies, Koch Bros and Exxon Mobil Tillerson friends! #ShitholePresident
971 2018-01-22 22:08:56 I am going to guess his tax returns would show he is heavily invested in the oil industry. He is lining his own pockets big time. Prove me wrong, release the tax info. Please.
972 2018-01-22 22:08:46 Just like in 1980 the @GOP stopped solar and renewable energy in its tracks to prop up #SaudiArabia and other oil producing countries. #InBedWithOil
973 2018-01-22 22:08:46 I agree.  There were things about Obama I didn’t like - and every other President.  However, in this case, I am struggling to find anything I LIKE with this man.  I’m sorry, but he makes snake oil salesmen look respectable.
974 2018-01-22 22:08:44 I think that Oil money is draining out lool they miss out on Sanchez because they only prepared to pay 20 millions for him .
975 2018-01-22 22:08:19 That sounds vaguely like the pumpkin pie beard oil I wear.
976 2018-01-22 22:08:17 I'm sure the gas and oil lobby appreciates this.
977 2018-01-22 22:08:07 Duh! Oil prices and Trudeau are the reasons!! Fools seldom differ!
978 2018-01-22 22:07:44 Don’t know that I agree with your analysis completely.  They want the pipeline because America is still hooked on oil and doesn’t want to see 1973 happen twice.
979 2018-01-22 22:07:37 Snake oil saleswoman
980 2018-01-22 22:07:36 Fat – this describes the oil content in paints, for example, Burnt umber has a ‘low fat’ oil content, so it is a fast drying oil paint because there is less oil in the paint mixture to oxidise and dry. Ivory black has a ‘high fat’ oil content so takes longer to dry.
981 2018-01-22 22:07:30 This whole pic smell like coconut oil. 
982 2018-01-22 22:07:25 On Saturday I was marinating chickens and one fell to the floor. I was going to throw it in the trash and they forced me to wash it and put it with the others :S
And yesterday finally they changed the oil and the smell was one of the most disgusting things of my life
983 2018-01-22 22:07:16 You can just keep grinding to get the Smooth Oil. There are two encounters that aren't too bad. That's what Freddeh and I were planning to do for our RPGLB run.
984 2018-01-22 22:07:12 I never drank Monster Energy till they were the Cup Series’ title sponsor. I’ve shopped at @Lowes ever since they sponsored Mike Skinner way back in the day, and I generally buy the motor oil my favorite team uses. I support the companies that support my favorite sport/drivers!
985 2018-01-22 22:07:11 Why is Trump sabotaging American innovation and our energy future.  Does he have some coal and oil investments?  Can someone in the media check this out. Never has the USA relinquished it’s leadership for new and innovative ideas. Under Trumps energy plan I see visions of Mordor.
986 2018-01-22 22:07:10 And it’s potential role in  ethical/sustainable supply chain assurance: organic cotton, sustainable soy and palm oil, fairtrade cocoa, ethically mines commodities etc, etc.
987 2018-01-22 22:06:51 My curls are so damn defined yall  coconut oil really does the job
988 2018-01-22 22:06:49 And they still jacked up the price for Netflix.  What are they big oil?

992 2018-01-22 22:05:39 20 odd years in UK North Sea Oil and Gas. Wish I made 150k a year! One of our guys went down in a Super Puma in 2009. And a friend of mine was on the one with all the fatalities a week before it went down. I was a software engineer now, but now I'm on the regulation/safety side

995 2018-01-22 22:05:21 It’s just like “we don’t need to drill for oil because we ride the bus” statement
996 2018-01-22 22:05:17 Not surprising, but still insanely stupid.  So.... they open everything to oil drilling, coal burning, and try to hurt solar.  And collect $$$$ for donations from fossil fuel companies.  The Republicans are comic book villains at this point. #climatechange
997 2018-01-22 22:05:04 I just want to go on record saying tea tree oil does nothing for me and I will never use it again!

1002 2018-01-22 22:04:12 Girl, coconut oil is my bodies bestfriend
1003 2018-01-22 22:04:12 OIL DIFF: 5.39 -> 5.42
1004 2018-01-22 22:04:05 What’s our tariff on oil imports?
1005 2018-01-22 22:04:03 UP NEXT: Trump will drown puppies in oil while arbitrarily spraying aerosol canisters.
1006 2018-01-22 22:04:03 I don't think we are responsible for it . For decades the British, the US and other western nations have been complicit due to wanting the oil to fuel our economies . Remember, it was the Arab countries that attacked Israel and got their asses kicked. THEIR decision to do that.
1007 2018-01-22 22:03:51 Ok. More out of spite, to suppress new solar installations, I guess. Could have started w steel, but that would hurt oil industry.
1008 2018-01-22 22:03:46 Mobil 1 oil and filter.
1009 2018-01-22 22:03:41 WOW no wonder Oil so high in the standings.
1010 2018-01-22 22:03:33 Shale oil. Requires horizontal drilling & fracking. Expensive to explore & produce. OPEC, or more accurately, the Saudis, dropped oil prices to $60 or so a BBL. for a reason. Costs per BBL. for shale thought around $50, but sensitive to volume.

1013 2018-01-22 22:03:17 Wow I tried Vitamin E oil for my face last summer after I heard it clears your skin well and it brought hella pimples about a week later smh 
1014 2018-01-22 22:03:13 I suspect Koch brothers and their oil base support the tariffs.
1015 2018-01-22 22:03:09 Why did the Hollywood celebrity and a handful of old stale oil?
1016 2018-01-22 22:03:04 Or maybe an actual ingredient that’s going to produce and give moisture in your skin like hyaluronic acid, vitamin b5, etc?  So sick of women trying the easy way out and buying one ‘natural! oil from the drugstore and thinking it’s going to solve all of their skincare issues
1017 2018-01-22 22:02:59 あ、25日なのね、でもどっちにしろ駄目か……平日だもんね……
1018 2018-01-22 22:02:52 That last move up by oil hurt... ouch.
1019 2018-01-22 22:02:50 Coconut oil is holy but imma look into that avo oil bih
1020 2018-01-22 22:02:44 Wow I used coconut oil for my eczema, no wonder IT DID NOTHING
1021 2018-01-22 22:02:29 Thanks for the mention! TheCarterCrowd: @MamaKautz What is your go-to oil above all others - just for general wellness?
1022 2018-01-22 22:02:12 This happened when I stopped birth control. It's finally getting better, but I'm still getting rid of the scars.

I started exfoliating twice a day, made my own serum with vitamin E, tea tree oil and bio oil. I also feel like Aztec healing clay helped
1023 2018-01-22 22:02:02 مطلوب دعم منكم وكيفية المساهمة في دعم المشاريع حقنا فنحن بحاجة لذالك الدعم
1024 2018-01-22 22:01:50 Take that, oil dependency
1025 2018-01-22 22:01:34 I like the way you think.
1026 2018-01-22 22:01:24 Natural gas is better than oil, but fracking is an enormous problem -- bad for the environment, disastrous for local communities. Solar and wind are renewable.
1027 2018-01-22 22:01:19 We need some actual stable geniuses to fix our oil mess. We are dependent on our own demise.
1028 2018-01-22 22:01:10 “Oil??????”
1029 2018-01-22 22:01:02 #forex Crude Oil Prices Struggle as Gold Eyes US Government Shutdown: Crude oil prices are struggling despite OPEC and Russia signaling their cooperation may continue beyond this year’s supply cut deal. Gold prices are eyeing the on-going US government shutdown. #forexsignals
1030 2018-01-22 22:00:59 I forgot my hair oil and I thought it'd be ok to put a little bit of this black hair product smh my hair is so greasy now what was I thinking with my fragile hair
1031 2018-01-22 22:00:55 It is getting warmer, it is a great time to get your oil changed, top off fluids or deal with any other concerns. 720-897-5766

1042 2018-01-22 22:00:02 Nail varnish remover is very drying so rinse off quickly and apply oil or cream to nails afterwards
1043 2018-01-22 21:59:59 I mean, you could glaze it with linseed oil (or maybe another pull medium such as Galkyd) and that'll help slow down the process, but delamination is pretty hard to stop.
1044 2018-01-22 21:59:53 And some of what we burn was once free, then locked into vegetation that then became fossil fuels. But that does raise the Q of adiabatic oil. So it's not an easy, one answer fits all, question.
1045 2018-01-22 21:59:39 The oil rig ones 
1046 2018-01-22 21:59:33 Olive oil in ears side effect.
1047 2018-01-22 21:59:30 @joshh_skelly your properly right mate we can't compete with that kind money but we always still produce quality players without accepting oil money. we're properly run club with history teams can only dream bout.
1048 2018-01-22 21:59:29 Oil rig explosion, Fort Worth fire, Norman police chase collision to name a few.... there’s a lot of people who need your prayers today!
1049 2018-01-22 21:59:25 I got cha lil momma 

Coconut oil & everything 
1050 2018-01-22 21:59:22 Word I bought some tea tree Oil today for that purpose, I use coconut oil occasionally and I’ll have to scoop some lavender
1051 2018-01-22 21:59:17 OH GA WORK ANG CASTOR OIL HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA
1052 2018-01-22 21:59:08 I'm in the oil industry, and have been for 20 years :) I love regulation - can't get enough of it. Especially helicopters, I poop my pants every time I get into a Super Puma. They should regulate the crap out of those death traps :P I'm not US by the way, UK, North Sea
1053 2018-01-22 21:58:59 Very much so,thank you :)
1054 2018-01-22 21:58:57 Unfortunately Canada can’t seem to get anything together for pipelines but we still have to buy oil and gas from foreign countries!
1055 2018-01-22 21:58:41 What good is 2x efficiency from CRISPR if biofuels are not going to catch up to fracked gas and cheap oil?

I still see a lot of biofuels zombies walking around. It's like they're from the year 2008, when the Cleantech bubble was in effect and the shale revolution just starting
1056 2018-01-22 21:58:38 Do you understand the amount of money wm takes from our oil, whiskey and other revenues “subsidises”  yeah with our own money It’s you who is ignorant
1057 2018-01-22 21:58:26 Big Oil, Big Nat Gas
1058 2018-01-22 21:58:26 And one more thing do you really feel clubs like Arsenal can truly compete with teams with unlimited budget ? I just dont see it.Even a superpower like Barca couldnt hold on to their star once the oil money comes calling.
1059 2018-01-22 21:58:17 Make America Import Oil Again
1060 2018-01-22 21:58:15 I suffered from eczema for years and tried everything under the sun. Coconut oil was the only thing that helped. My skin has never been clearer also. Never break out. No more Red bumps, no more eczema 
1061 2018-01-22 21:57:59 Martha Stewart tweeting “oil” is funnier than Jeff Dunham’s entire career, for example
1062 2018-01-22 21:57:48 Rub oregano oil on your feet with socks 
1063 2018-01-22 21:57:45 #ERMSLegSim Hybrid cars still require oil, gasoline, plastics (derived from petroleum) We are not ready to go 100% green, we do need to encourage #greentechnology. But right now we need emergency efforts to stop a #fuelshortage and #economiccollapse
1064 2018-01-22 21:57:40 Heck yeah oil scenes are my fav!
1065 2018-01-22 21:57:39 Will you also be doing 'fast oil changes whilst driving' for an A Class..?
1066 2018-01-22 21:57:24 Oh FFS.  It's like he's against anything progressive. While solar still has a long way to go to be commercially viable and isn't yet as green as we'd like, it's a good start getting away from oil/gas/coal.  This is not helping our future generations nor our planet.
1067 2018-01-22 21:57:19 @Lucas oil products and tickets for the @cbnationals
1068 2018-01-22 21:57:11 Oil well explosion - Quinton!
1069 2018-01-22 21:57:01 Good idea ! Yeah you're right . Spending much money just to change Engine oil can be costly.
1070 2018-01-22 21:56:55 Coconut oil
1071 2018-01-22 21:56:54 I need some black seed oil.
1072 2018-01-22 21:56:22 It's a sore one but one I'll get over very easily if we get Auba as well. You needed goals, bought Sanchez and as you said shat over Oil FC in the process. Who's dropping to the bench you now thou?
1073 2018-01-22 21:56:03 Haha definitely don’t sell snake oil. Million of people who have been into any of my content know that. It’s only people who make quick assumptions that make that accusation.
1074 2018-01-22 21:55:50 #ERMSLegSim We have got to become independent of OPEC’s whims. The Middle East has not historically been a dependable source of oil. We need to drill our own to set our own prices!
1075 2018-01-22 21:55:47 We do!!!!  But both Senators from Oklahoma are insane. One of them is senile and living off the big oil tit. The other one hates women and keeps trying to shove his 'religion' down our throats. The people of Oklahoma have taxation without representation.
1076 2018-01-22 21:55:46 I buy Mobil 1 oil , GreatClips, Napa, Chevrolet, Casey’s
1077 2018-01-22 21:55:16 Oxfam report: To deliver high returns to those at the top, corporations  squeeze workers ever harder – and to avoid paying taxes !!! OIL FIRMS
1078 2018-01-22 21:55:11 Current US position is essentially  against international trade. Free & fair trade is good, but we gave away too much sovereignty under the #NAFTA.   Not adverse to Cda walking away from #NAFTA. Trump too unstable. Big world out there. Then there's the discount on our oil.
1079 2018-01-22 21:55:03 Castor oil
1080 2018-01-22 21:54:59 CBD oil is underated tbh. It’s stopped full on anxiety attacks I’ve had before. Most people won’t use it because they think it had THC in it
1081 2018-01-22 21:54:58 Thank you ! Hope your having a relaxing evening 
1082 2018-01-22 21:54:53 I grew up around friends and family that has/currently work on oil rigs.  They don't like all the regulations.  They are on the front line and I value their opinion.
1083 2018-01-22 21:54:53 Getting an oil change I think.
1084 2018-01-22 21:54:51 My response was why don't they just follow a recipe.

She said if you wanted to change the oil in your car would you confidently do it following instructions if you have never done it before

I said no  she said following a recipe is the same if you have never cooked
1085 2018-01-22 21:54:48 DO NOT PUT CLOVE OIL IN YOUR MOUTH. No matter how bad your toothache is!
1086 2018-01-22 21:54:41 #ERMSLegSim Forget oil!  We need to subsidize the hybrid car industry!  Stop relying on OPEC and #GoGreen.
1087 2018-01-22 21:54:39 Because he HAS been leveraged by Russia. Americans aren’t stupid. We know a con when we see one. He’s in deep. Gotta lift them sanction for that putin oil deal but got caught laundering their dirty money in the process.
1088 2018-01-22 21:54:36 Hmmm... write down some debt, provide the gov. with some billions to pay all the bills it is due. Guarantee ELA to banks to prevent another bank run, spend some billions on solar cells to enable lower oil imports.

1090 2018-01-22 21:54:18 Football fans singing that they are the club they support until they die, of course you fucking are unless you’re a prick who jumps ship as soon as some loaded oil thief buys some also-rans and turns them into a ‘big club’ #shitechant
1091 2018-01-22 21:54:08 oil is worse. you don’t refrigerate oil, it turns to a solid
1092 2018-01-22 21:54:08 read a blog and washed my hair with coconut oil now i look like i wear brown plaid pajama pants to class
1093 2018-01-22 21:54:03 You don't? I thought it was Alberta law to mumble the boom bust prayer whenever you fill up...

"God, grant us one more oil boom so we can rub Trudeau's face in it. Amen."
1094 2018-01-22 21:53:54 treated myself to some parmesan pesto rotini...in essence I just ingested like a gallon of olive oil lol
1095 2018-01-22 21:53:50 I think real irony is that saudis wanted an oil&gas pipeline to EU through Turkey, but erdowan demanded too big of a cut. So they paid c/f millions to get cia to stage a coup to take him out. However, stupid hill-pill's server with plans was hacked & erdowan derailed coup plot.
1096 2018-01-22 21:53:47 Yup, @realDonaldTrump wants to party like its 1899 and has Putin oil and gas envy.
1097 2018-01-22 21:53:30 Me and stress we're practically like water and the oil we don't mix,I be on my get the fuck outta here mode ertym.

1099 2018-01-22 21:53:20 When I put lemon oil on the fretboard of a guitar to condition it the cats go fucking mental for it.

1101 2018-01-22 21:53:04 i just think of canola oil
1102 2018-01-22 21:53:00 $60 for gas that last near a week & a half, $35 oil changes, unaerodynamically friendly on the freeway, bigger tires heavy on the gas, etc....this Jeep life ain’t all sugars & kisses 
1103 2018-01-22 21:52:33 Turkey allowed ISIS to cross into Syria, they funded them, baught oil from them through a backdoor, which Russia released satellite images of. 
When you suppress a group within their country, not only is that called racism, it's also a future ethnic cleansing. Turkey is ISIS.
1104 2018-01-22 21:52:29 Heidi’s issue will be R turnout in a heavily R state where Trump is fairly popular. She’s got good crossover appeal and is good at local politics but still needs a low R turnout to win. She should have voted for the tax bill tho. It would have helped her w/ the oil industry
1105 2018-01-22 21:52:23 What is your go-to oil above all others - just for general wellness?
1106 2018-01-22 21:52:23 Exacccctttlllyyyyy my hair would be dried by the time I leave the bathroom  it's so irritating!!! I use extra olive oil, TRESemme  conditioner and water in a spray bottle I livvveeeeee by it!
1107 2018-01-22 21:52:23 Woody: "noone has ever written about these follys"
Me: There are hundreds of articles on Oil draft woes. Google them.
Woody: "oh...but not that..."
Me: Mkay. You get the point.
Woody: "but but... Hall"
Me: *sighs sullenly as he watches the poor horse be beaten, again*

1108 2018-01-22 21:52:18 Motor oil changed.
Primary oil changed.
Clutch adjusted.
New saddlebag clips installed.
Wash bike... maybe some other time!
1109 2018-01-22 21:52:11 As you said Julie, PKK is "our most effective anti-jihadist force". Indeed, PKK is just there to take the syrian oilfields without a blood of "our" soldiers. PKK/YPG blood are sacrificed to our goal : Syrian Oil.
1110 2018-01-22 21:51:57 All else being equal, the dollar price of oil would go up, off-setting the apparent "gain" of a stronger pound vs dollar...
1111 2018-01-22 21:51:52 Ours is oil too - no gas in the village. Time for your thermals and hand-knits!
1112 2018-01-22 21:51:50 i’m laughing to myself very loudly at the car place waiting room bc this oil change is taking FORWVER
1113 2018-01-22 21:51:47 You sure? I mean maybe not in your lifetime, but I’m definitely worried for my children and grandchildren’s future. The human population is only growing and more and more people are using oil. Only a matter of time before we do
1114 2018-01-22 21:51:45 No it's just the opposite, save the earth = feed the people, on the other hand, ruin the earth so oil companies can enjoy their ridiculous profits for another decade? Wasn't Trump's EPA chief a big oil lobbyist? This is all about oil $$. Its simple, pollution is bad, 4 everyone.
1115 2018-01-22 21:51:36 #ERMSLegSim Drilling for oil has proven to be a dangerous endeavor for the environment.  Don't ruin the delicate ecosystems of #CroatanNF!  Don't forget the disasters! #ExxonValdez #BPOilSpill2010
1116 2018-01-22 21:51:29 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
1117 2018-01-22 21:51:25 Coconut oil really makes me break out 
1118 2018-01-22 21:51:16 オリーブ油で毎日を楽しく(*^_^*)
1119 2018-01-22 21:51:15 We are getting the latest on what's happening with @KelsiePassolt at @KDLTNews 

Patrick hopes that the weather gang is not breaking up the furniture and using the burning oil drum to keep warm.
1120 2018-01-22 21:51:12 Bag of flour and some oil makes multiple pizza bases ... then leftovers work a treat  

But yes still a burger remains cheaper :( #AllOurHealth
1121 2018-01-22 21:51:10 Oh ya, tan for 2 hours straight with baby oil and no goggles, you’ll look fried for sure ahah
1122 2018-01-22 21:51:03 Body smells like coconut oil.
1123 2018-01-22 21:50:51 Weak dollar works for us because oil is priced in dollars. 

A $50 barrel now costs c. £35 whereas it did cost c. £40. 

Even better if you happen to live in Euroland...
1124 2018-01-22 21:50:48 Megyn Kelly doesn't know her history. The Viet nam war was all about the oil in the South China Sea. Ho Chi Min wrote to Eisenhower to get rid of the French.
Min had great respect for our constitution. Eisenhower refused. Then history happened. Sounds like Iraq to me.
1125 2018-01-22 21:50:45  Would you let me build your CBD Oil business for the next 7 days while you decide if it's for you? 
For FREE!!! Yes Free!!  Ask me how!
1126 2018-01-22 21:50:41 The reason why I believe in surge in oil prices is that first off it benefits a lot of major players in this industry. Both governments as well as major energy companies. Secondly, the demand is not slowing down, unless we suddenly get a bunch of electric vehicles. 1/
1127 2018-01-22 21:50:36 Let them drown in oil and poise themselves by fracking residues in the water. They shall learn that one can not eat money, hopefully.
1128 2018-01-22 21:50:30 No one even talks about reducing our needs/use-and solar/wind also has costs-environmental costs-rare earth minerals-HEMP has great promise-even for making batteries-but being stymied cause oil/gas/coal

1130 2018-01-22 21:50:16 Sorry bro. It’s hard to be a snake oil salesman in 2018.
1131 2018-01-22 21:50:11 i have had a spirit of aggravation on me since saturday. i need to anoint myself with oil.
1132 2018-01-22 21:49:22 In the morning I recommend washing it, using oil, brush it out, then Styling Balm to seal it all in.
At night, wash around your mouth and stache (and the rest of it really) to get all the food and drinks out, then make sure your beard is brushed/detangled before bed.
-Josh
1133 2018-01-22 21:49:21 @NC_Governor There is a technology which eliminates the need for more oil  As you may imagine. it is next to impossible to get any traction for it. Interested in helping?
1134 2018-01-22 21:49:18 I can imagine Polly. Looked amazing
1135 2018-01-22 21:49:17 Up where? An oil rig?

Yessss Randall, let her know!! 
And don’t mind me. I’m catching up on #ThisIsUs
1138 2018-01-22 21:49:10 Wonder whatever happened to Adega restaurants by Gateway, only Adega group I see around is Olive and Oil now
1139 2018-01-22 21:49:05 I say that Barry's best moment was telling the grand jury that he thought the cream and the clear was "flaxseed oil".

1144 2018-01-22 21:48:42 Obama could of stopped what happened before it turned into a federally funded war on natives. But big oil came first. He let this go on for months before stepping in. So maybe he didn’t use, but he sat idle as it was used.

1157 2018-01-22 21:47:00 The country’s resources have already been looted. USA should immediately stop its imports of Venezuelan oil -which will accelerate Maduro’s downfall; you take down Cuba only a few weeks later. Too late to care for the Venezuelan people. The priority now is to guard the continent.
1158 2018-01-22 21:46:47 @Michael_WI @MaryKPH Roast beef was on sale. Now roasting a 2 lb roast. First I sauteed some onion, then seared the roast, then coated the potatoes with the oil and drippings, added celery, salt and pepper, and now it is in the oven. I will have peas and a nice salad with it

1161 2018-01-22 21:46:33 We’ll get a preview of this trend in 2020 when the IMO’s 0.5% sulfur cap kicks in. Demand for HSFO in shipping will all but vanish. Current fuel oil crack for 2020 is around minus $20/b - if it keeps going lower you betcha we’ll see oil-fired power gen return

1166 2018-01-22 21:45:48 that do. Until shit like oil is traded in bitcoin, the ability for cryptos to have value relies on it sucking money from already established central banks. It’s a currency being treated like a penny stock, and to invest in it for real would be dumb.

1183 2018-01-22 21:43:57 Its craft glitter placed on with coconut oil. Comes off easily but i like that bc i feel its on top of the oil instead of directly on my skin. Powdered mica for soap making is very glittery and non-toxic but i havent tried it yet when I do ill let you know how it looks
1184 2018-01-22 21:43:54 It contains shea butter, calendula oil and arnica to repair the skin's barrier. Great if you suffer with dermatitis too, and even a lot of people with acne use it to calm inflammation. #irishbeautyhour
1185 2018-01-22 21:43:39 -Keep it moisturized with Beard Oil or Utility Balm
-You don't need to wash it every day, find a routine that works for you

1195 2018-01-22 21:42:53 What isn't taken into account @CraigKellyMP is the emissions produced to search for, dig up, process and refine and transport all the oil into petrol before it is burnt.

1199 2018-01-22 21:42:45 Legalizing #marijuana is only the beginning. We need to authorize industrial hemp farming so Americans can buy hemp products (which ARE already legal in all 50 states) that are MADE IN THE USA. Right now you can buy hemp oil for your salad, but not grow hemp to make the oil.

1223 2018-01-22 21:40:27 Alright, but when it bumps into the UK coats, I've got a load more human detritus to throw on it. 

And then we douse it in oil and set it alight. Drown or burn.
1224 2018-01-22 21:40:24 Excellent news. Now for part B:  authorizing industrial hemp farming so that fabrics, salad dressing oil, vitamins, and the 1000 other uses for hemp are being created DOMESTICALLY instead of importing all that from Canada.
1225 2018-01-22 21:40:23 I’m mean it is a product issue from the aspect that oil prices have been too low. We need a bigger differential between diesel and nat gas to shorten the payback period for gas trucks. But I think both @CE_NatGas @A_Littlefair and @WestportDotCom can do abette job with messaging.

1234 2018-01-22 21:39:32 @DonLagreca @RealMichaelKay I would root for the German Army against the Eagles, and will pull for NE. But the Patriots are hard to like due to cheating allegations, Brady being a snake oil salesman, plus Belichick and Kraft are hard to like.

1259 2018-01-22 21:36:08 So basically these companies are selling snake oil? Even if they get blood work showing their levels increased by 50 units? Could have been because of training or getting blood work right after waking up?

My car engine's crankshaft shot out and punctured the oil pan. Engine's completely busted and I need a "new" one.

1290 2018-01-22 21:33:00 IMF estimates we subsidize big oil to the tune of $10 MILLION per MINUTE. If we did that for clean energy, we could switch in no time.
1291 2018-01-22 21:32:59 Doubt it was primarily about oil.
1292 2018-01-22 21:32:58 Yeah man, I burned a lot of midnight oil in my twenties. Eventually caught up to me and I realized how it was hurting me much more than helping.

1297 2018-01-22 21:31:52 You're missing my point. If oil flows commercially the "insiders" will be the 1st to know & react.  The chart will show that. By the time private investors know abt it the chart will hv already shown its hand. It seems strange that yr ceo/chairman has zero shareholding

1313 2018-01-22 21:29:52 Sure you do, but won't admit it.  Dems put tremendous regs on oil/coal companies to ultimately put them out of business.  Remember what #44 said?  Again, what's in your tank?
1314 2018-01-22 21:29:40 That's is why they say use coconut oil in the night but oh well,

1322 2018-01-22 21:28:45 Gonna sound like a total hipster but I buy beard oils at local shops and stuff. I make sure it has lavender, tea tree oil, coconut oil, castor oil.

But mainly the lavender and tea tree oil based ones.
1323 2018-01-22 21:28:36 I want much better for my children and grandchildren. The corporate shill have looked out for the rich while selling our environment to big oil and our salaries to the 2%. Hopefully we can clean house before they can blacken our coastlines with spills from last century’s energy.
1324 2018-01-22 21:28:35 Evening primrose oil. Google it.
1325 2018-01-22 21:28:33 FYI Fox, we dont care what any of the "pollsters" aka snake oil salesmen aka con artists you parade on air have to say. Theyre all PROVEN liars after 2016 election.
1326 2018-01-22 21:28:15 Our Secretary of the Interior , Ryan Zinke, is doing his best to further damage our Atlantic & Gulf coastlines, and dismantle our public lands. They will drill for oil off the Atlantic coastline, in the Gulf; dig for coal on public lands; use fracking adding toxins to our water

1331 2018-01-22 21:27:20 How many cubic miles of oil under Saudi Arabia ?

The infographic is either misleading or confusing.

You ought elaborate on it more.
Are these plants “running” ?
Or being built ?

Of course this needs massive transport & infra.
Have you netted it out ?

1336 2018-01-22 21:26:53 today was my stern face day. 
Ever tried mixing oil and water?
1337 2018-01-22 21:26:38 Wow, honestly didn't know any of that, so no oil clubs like City, why can that not be put in place here, surely would only benefit the national team as well, although Holland are not great at the moment but they are a tiny nation.

1341 2018-01-22 21:26:05 Yeah because they let people on social media tell them that coconut oil is an all purpose use product. It’s not even close to being that lol the best use is for moisturizing dry hair.
1342 2018-01-22 21:26:01 @amandaaevee_ gonna try that avocado oil in my scalp or better yet also Vera
1343 2018-01-22 21:25:57 Today I made Italian herb and cheese bread. My secret plot is to use up ALL the olive oil in the world! It's working.
1344 2018-01-22 21:25:51 And lastly, the more oil you use, the more you’ll have to shampoo, which we all know isn’t necessarily curly/kinky hair’s best friend because it strips our hair of its natural oils
1345 2018-01-22 21:25:42 Difference is Utd use their own resources and are not run by oil like Chelsea and Man City
1346 2018-01-22 21:25:41 Simple way to weaken Putin's aggression right now is to decrease oil price. That really works great.
1347 2018-01-22 21:25:36 Now you're dreaming. GOP base ARE anti-immigrant. Trump's rabid right would boil them in oil if they could get away with it. So good luck with that.
1348 2018-01-22 21:25:24 You know what? @FrankCamorra and the Movida team have teamed up with Spanish olive oil brand, Moro, to bring an exclusive extra virgin olive oil to Australia. #YUM @MoVidaMelbourne

1351 2018-01-22 21:24:51 So lets drill oil in Alaska, lets drill more off the coasts, & turn our cars into coal burners. Speaking of. The restrictions that were removed on coal industry had the highest death rate in the last 15 years.... happen last year. Keep on arguing though. I applaud your tenacity.
1352 2018-01-22 21:24:49 3) conditioner is really the only thing that’ll seal in moisture. 4) they say that coconut oil can actually dry your hair out because you’re “clogging” the hair shaft from letting conditioner in (which is what’s mainly needed for moisture)
1353 2018-01-22 21:24:47 Also try using palm oil for the stewthank me later
1354 2018-01-22 21:24:46 Ah good old cultural appropriation, clearly it's not enough to just steal our oil.

1357 2018-01-22 21:23:33 Every natural hair stylist say that it isn’t necessary. 1) most natural hair products (assuming that you use them) contain oil in them already. 2) the molecules in coconut oil (or any oil) are too big to enter the hair, so it’s just sitting in top of your hair, not doing anything
1358 2018-01-22 21:23:29 She uses "Oil of a Lay" for her glowing skin.
1359 2018-01-22 21:23:26 The castor oil is actually helping a lot 
1360 2018-01-22 21:23:25 Only benefit for me is using it as an oil base in my hair after washing it. Otherwise, I’ll never use it anywhere else.
1361 2018-01-22 21:23:24 Seriously stuck here cause my oil change ! My lazy ass should of just done it myself
1362 2018-01-22 21:23:18 why are oil changes one of the scariest things you do as a young female?
1363 2018-01-22 21:23:05 Do I look like I can change oil???

1367 2018-01-22 21:21:57 My mom uses those cups of handcleaner used by mechanics to get oil and grease off their hands. Just rub it on the stain with a toothbrush, let it sit for a while then wash!
1368 2018-01-22 21:21:39 Who is the idiot? The snake oil salesman? Or the person that bought the snake oil?
1369 2018-01-22 21:21:30 "I need my car by 2." At 2 Nissan tells me it's not done yet. I took it in to get the block heater cord switched over. that's it.But they know my oil, which was changed 2 weeks ago, is past due? Uh?

1373 2018-01-22 21:21:14 I also mix in a few drops of tea tree oil but it’s not necessary, but does have incredible benefits
1374 2018-01-22 21:21:02 Y’all need w a t e r! If you’re dry, you need things that provide  hydration (hydra!!!) before you go on applying any oil.

1379 2018-01-22 21:20:38 I have dry scalp, once a week I mix sugar, olive oil, some shea butter and castor oil and massage it into my scalp. You need to shampoo after and depending on how much you have left you can save it or use it to exfoliate your body. It’s amazing. And if you don’t have the others -

1412 2018-01-22 21:17:13 Those venerable oil paintings in museums & cathedrals, now considered fine art, were originally commissioned by religious leaders to sell their concept of god, forgiveness and the ever after. TY Abbot & best 2U fellow Citizen.
1413 2018-01-22 21:17:07 I don't think excise duty on girls should be there at all,since we do not have crude oil.Instead get should incentivise on fuel imports.
1414 2018-01-22 21:16:59 It is interesting.  But if oil flows commercially then the chart becomes worthless. The reason your crossovers crossed over is because the results didn't fall within that period, and people were selling on no news

1419 2018-01-22 21:16:30 Theirs a cheese popcorn at tags it's cooked with coconut oil it's addictivelly goid while it's good for you
1420 2018-01-22 21:16:26 At least that knife selling Ponzi scheme sold knifes and not hot oil that burns if it gets on or near you
1421 2018-01-22 21:16:14 Haha no better money than oil money
1422 2018-01-22 21:16:12 coconut oil isn't a good moisturizer????? everything i know is a LIE!!!
1423 2018-01-22 21:15:51 Exactly. It’s my superiority complex that keeps me moving every day. As I’m sure your typing away in a room with central heat and air? Oil and gas much yourself? Or Amish?
1424 2018-01-22 21:15:47 A woman's place is, like a man's place, where she decides to be by working for it. No one is forcing all those nurses to work there instead of an oil rig in Northern Alaska
1425 2018-01-22 21:15:46 Whip together 4 1/2 tbsps ginger with 4 1/2 tbsps unicorn tears. Adorn with  Olive Oil. Drain. Serve with a nice chianti.
1426 2018-01-22 21:15:41 ONLY WITH OIL
1427 2018-01-22 21:15:38 I keep seeing this so i will address it coconut oil is not bad for yours skin it is not only a sealant but it does moisturize your skin.. in fact it acts as a sealant to seal in that moisture.. it’s about the amount that you use that can be harmful or cause acne breakouts
1428 2018-01-22 21:15:37 These are on my timeline, and your club paid me good oil money 
1429 2018-01-22 21:15:34 Tsibipians are definitely burning the midnight oil tonight 
1430 2018-01-22 21:15:14 Hope no one mentions the Corrib Oil is a rip off as well. The room will explode @edmcgreal @Gerry_Flan93 @RichieHeneghan @AlanMoran7 @AltoirClaire #loyaltytag #petrolordiesel
1431 2018-01-22 21:15:12 Another stock market record day.  But Bitcoin drops nearly 10 percent.  Natural gas gains, crude oil basically flat.  Does this relate to the possible end of the government shutdown?

1433 2018-01-22 21:14:44 Chop come garlic cloves and put them in a jar of olive oil with thyme. Infused oil anytime you want :)
1434 2018-01-22 21:14:43 Nope; took *20* yrs. 1st Yes in Devo Ref was 1979; Labour moved goalposts (40% Rule) & denied result . Night b4 SP set up in 1999, Tony Blair did deal with UKgov to *move maritime border* so oil wells wr in “English” waters. Then they “let” us have parly!!
1435 2018-01-22 21:14:40 Always hyperbolic with the end of the world rhetoric. Who are these " tens of millions?" 
Give it a rest Chicken Little.
1436 2018-01-22 21:14:39 Been stopped using coconut oil it did nothing but clog my pores & make my dark marks darker.
1437 2018-01-22 21:14:38 Man it be taking these mfs forever to do my oil change.
1438 2018-01-22 21:14:34 Want to get really wacky?  Werner Herzog and David Lynch as the oil tycoon villains.
1439 2018-01-22 21:14:32 That Baby Oil Keep Them Legs On Fleek
1440 2018-01-22 21:14:21 You're telling a faceless social media post for an oil company to serve in the marines. Just really think before you tweet, please.

1445 2018-01-22 21:13:47 Electric is not a better alternative plus big oil will never let that happen.

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
1447 2018-01-22 21:13:15 Can you try oil of Olay?
1448 2018-01-22 21:13:11 Chef McElroy cut up some acne, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was chicken, along with cheese.

1450 2018-01-22 21:13:00 The only oil I use in my car is the oil that Jeff Gordon supported.
1451 2018-01-22 21:12:56 You'll know soon enough
1452 2018-01-22 21:12:56 That being said, maybe blanched into some decently hot oil is more up to speed? Steamed veggies are just awful.
1453 2018-01-22 21:12:46 There are many more manufactured parts in a combustion engine car than an electric car, plus emissions in *cat cracker* conversion of oil to petrol & transportation to service stations. Kelly MP's claim dubious.
1454 2018-01-22 21:12:39 Gotta be an adult and go get an oil change after work. Gonna use my Groupon 
1455 2018-01-22 21:12:31 As we continue to queue for fuel, remember Nigeria has four refineries ...four refineries that should have been privatised to oil companies that have the technical know how and expertise to run these refineries and help reduce our need to import fuel.
1456 2018-01-22 21:12:22 Look for “nail oil” Can find in a nailpolish looking container and also in pen format that is super portable!
1457 2018-01-22 21:12:09 I’m still mad that I’ve only learned how good tomatoes are only a year or so ago.  I typically just use a bit of olive oil for my sautéing needs.
1458 2018-01-22 21:12:05 A better analogy would be if Congress ignored illegal oil drilling in national parks for forty years, and you shut down the government unless it was legislatively permitted in an unrelated spending bill.
1459 2018-01-22 21:12:00 #GNatWFFS The Ricchiutis founded ENZO Olive Oil Company in 2008. From its inception, the Ricchiutis adopted the highest quality standards into their olive oil. Booth 582 at #WFFS18
1460 2018-01-22 21:11:57 Point? Do you want a functional state government? And I didn’t recall oil and gas lowering gas prices when we lowered their GPT back in 2014 or 2015.
1461 2018-01-22 21:11:47 Need to learn how to do an oil change 
1462 2018-01-22 21:11:32 the world is gonna be so weird when there's no oil left but you can still talk to people on the internet
1463 2018-01-22 21:11:31 In Oklahoma an oil rig exploded today. 5 people missing. Not only is fossil fuels destroying the planet the danger to human beings is horrific. If solar farms and wind farms were more plentiful it would save so much in lives, the Earth, & energy use as well as defund terrorists,
1464 2018-01-22 21:11:24 Pet peeve: When I order my food to be made fresh & I get straight up NOT fresh  And then have the nerve to lie and say it is. If you thought I wouldn’t be able to differentiate fresh out the oil fries, and them 36 min old joints you gave me, I should sock you.

1467 2018-01-22 21:10:49 Just cancelled my Ipsy subscription! Wasn't hating it, but not loving it lately. Plus, I just got my last bag today and had a coconut oil spill over everything inside, so that was the "Yep, I'm definitely done" moment. Now I just have a massive makeup collection to use!

1472 2018-01-22 21:10:06 Tried to make khai jiao (Thai-style omelet) for the first time last night. I definitely can't get the oil in my wok hot enough with my pissy little gas stove. Anybody know any tricks, or am I just at the mercy of physics here?
1473 2018-01-22 21:09:53 Wanna follow me then ‘oil white fan’
1474 2018-01-22 21:09:49 Must have mutual friends. Also a lot of pedalling of cannabis oil going on. 
1475 2018-01-22 21:09:46 I had not heard that before. It is such a powerful idea. I must exploit, hoard, & sell this resource. Just Like Oil ;)
1476 2018-01-22 21:09:38 These are successful lawsuits: the lawyers get paid win or lose; there is the issue of the lawsuit cost being born by taxpayers and oil product consumers with no associated benefit.
1477 2018-01-22 21:09:31 If you want to know what kind of mood I'm in just look at my hairstyle. Today its I don't give a fuck & yes I used too much coconut oil. #meh
1478 2018-01-22 21:09:16 A reasonable forward looking, 50- 75 yr fix for immigration is a must. Reducing or eliminating certain catagories must be part of plan.

1480 2018-01-22 21:09:12 What has happened to oil price in the last one year ? What has happened to reserves in the last one year ? What has happened to quarterly GDP growth in the last one year ?
1481 2018-01-22 21:08:50 My car dripped oil on my driveway. I put down five cups of baking soda and traded in the car.

1487 2018-01-22 21:07:55 Pero le sobra razón.  Nada de lo que alli dice es mentira. Soluciones tienen . Por ejemplo quitar el 9% de subsidio del precio del Gas Oil al boleto metropolitano son 4 pesos menos por litro y es el agro y la producción quienes lo pagan

1494 2018-01-22 21:07:27 I'm not so sure. The fact that the Chavistas been able to hold onto and consolidate power in the face of those oil rents becoming much smaller the last few years shows, I think, how much polarization has mattered.
1495 2018-01-22 21:06:48 Given that beer has replaced oil as Alberta's #1 liquid product, I just don't see how you let the protectionist walls down...

1503 2018-01-22 21:06:02 Why reject City and the chance to play for an oil company in front of blue seats every week and no history. I mean watching the likes of Richard Dunne, Steve Lomas, Niall Quinn and Paul Dickov i'm sure was the reason he got into football in the first place. What is he thinking?
1504 2018-01-22 21:05:51 oil prices had fallen by a bigger percentage for years

1522 2018-01-22 21:03:39 Yes! Though it depends on the brand of valve oil used. Petroleum-based valve oils are the ones that typically have a scent, but some of the synthetic valve oils have essentially no smell.
1523 2018-01-22 21:03:17 Spent so much money. But my son is good for the next 6 months. Just gotta get some glasses and an oil change and I’m Gucci 
1524 2018-01-22 21:03:08 Well, I agree that those are good choices. Most people use a little oil when they saute vegetables etc. Not sure if most are willing to give it up.
1525 2018-01-22 21:03:07 In 2014, FIRS did N4.69tn. The real question: is there progression in non-oil taxes? How fast is that compared to previous growth trend? N4tn is N700bn over 2016 and oil taxes were responsible for N400bn.

But as usual, we are just sad intelleshuals.

1534 2018-01-22 21:02:21 Let's hope so. As with a huge public sector and if totally free standing as an economy would be digging a really deep hole that without oil revenue and an increasing price would collapse and have to seek a financial union with some other country

1559 2018-01-22 20:59:53 Oh so it was a cold Wednesday night, and four pals went together to a local Orlando Walmart after midnight. What did they purchase? Four bottles of car oil and 50 ft of rope. 
1560 2018-01-22 20:59:50 Random "what's in the fridge?" stirfry night. Looks like carrots, cabbage & tofu w/ garlic, ginger, green onions & hot peppers. A handful of edamame from the freezer & all served over soba noodles. Sauce = soy, mirin, rice vin & sesame oil, topped w/ toasted sesame seeds! 
1561 2018-01-22 20:59:45 Ugghhhh and there’s not much you can take for them either. Get @HaydnSchneider to rub your temples with lavender oil and your feet too. Those have tons of pressure points in then to relieve tension. #PregnancyPampering

1564 2018-01-22 20:59:37 I'm surprised no one in this thread mentions the Israeli supply of arms to Argentina. Surely that's more important than possible oil finds.

1568 2018-01-22 20:59:10 There are Biblical prophesies that foresaw this, a battle between good and evil. It is a touchy subject that eventually ends with someone throwing boiling oil on the other. However, it is true. It will get worse. 
1569 2018-01-22 20:59:07 I’m finally getting an oil change. Now I need like 3 other things done to my car

1574 2018-01-22 20:58:35 The moisture that comes from the coconut oil is great. That was the best part but then i learned what it was doing under my skin and i switched about 5 months ago and tried it again recently and got contact dermatitis
1575 2018-01-22 20:58:27 Bugger my morals The palm oil industry doesn’t seem to worry vegans. I am going to order my first load of PKE and a load of Almond hulls. The cows won’t refuse it and it will help my bottom line. Thank you for making me more profitable Vegans    #Veganuary2018
1576 2018-01-22 20:58:21 coconut oil is trash lol
1577 2018-01-22 20:58:20 In other words she wasted all the North Sea oil money of the day on tax cuts & useless spending. Hence the 90’s nightmare as we were spending like it was never going to end.
1578 2018-01-22 20:58:17 I'll add that even if it goes back into those two lines, it still means higher. Again, I hope I'm wrong.
1579 2018-01-22 20:57:56 Called off today... my car so needs an oil change. I need an uber mechanic

1611 2018-01-22 20:53:24 The suit against US oil companies also misses the fact that vast majority of global reserves and production comes from State Oil Companies.

1618 2018-01-22 20:52:19 Also related to instruments: when playing a brass instrument, there's a very distinct smell of valve oil (which is honestly unlike any scent I can compare it to... maybe sort of woody?) and spit, released from the spit valve directly on to the floor.
1619 2018-01-22 20:52:18 And they never will. Even with years of success it will always boil down to the oil money.

1629 2018-01-22 20:50:39 For real. Some days the coconut oil just not work and the curl versus frizz ratio is off the charts.
1630 2018-01-22 20:50:33 Looks like they'll try for 65 then after all. These loons annoy me. Even my novice charting says they'll get a move higher (practically 65-ish).

1634 2018-01-22 20:49:46 Because the west takes every drop of it and it goes into Saudi Aramco, which in turn gets dropped on childrens heads in Yemen. They won't tell you this because they censor it, but it's the truth, oil is black gold and we own all of it and will destroy any thing/one to get it.

It then sticks to the pan at which point ive gotta scrape it off & voila: I’ve end up with scrambled egg
1651 2018-01-22 20:47:42 Here’s a thought: what is underneath Native American land belongs to them, including the oil. But they are forced to let the 1% take it for a profit while destroying Mother Earth. In exchange they get a pittance. Anything wrong with this picture?

1662 2018-01-22 20:47:01 Really you've been saying that since day one after your election win.  Still don't see any pipelines. Carbon tax is a great start to make oil companies invest money into alberta. DUH common sense goes along way.
1663 2018-01-22 20:46:48 Unfortunately, you are right!  But, could you imagine! We'd be an oil rich country with lower taxes and no carbon tax. We could be the envy of the free world, with a leader fighting for our country and it's people!  Instead we have none of the above!

1669 2018-01-22 20:45:45 I don’t disagree with the sentiment but considering we have the world’s largest deposits of lithium and would like to reduce oil imports to zero, promoting electric cars internationally if not locally is in our best interest.

1696 2018-01-22 20:42:47 Yes! Or like, “oh, I’m out of wine.” *books a flight to Mendoza, Argentina*. Or “damn, I’m running low on olive oil.” *books flight to italy*. “I could go for a nice cold Guinness.” *reserves hotel in Dublin*
1697 2018-01-22 20:42:16 This isn’t about secure borders - it is about Kurds and Oil!! You either know this or you don’t.

1702 2018-01-22 20:41:59 One of the single largest causes of deforestation is the production of palm oil. A vegan product.
1703 2018-01-22 20:41:32 Not sure if trolling, or earnest...
Not too bullish that refining oil is not profitable even at these prices.
1704 2018-01-22 20:41:25 Catch me on @kfor this evening responding to a study released by an oil and gas company that suggests they’re taxed too much. I did the interview from a food pantry, one of many private safety net organizations overstretched by the increasingly unmet needs of those in poverty.
1705 2018-01-22 20:41:19 okay the coffee I got today has me real jittery and I’m like pretty sure I have a quiz rn to focus a microscope into full oil emersion in 60 seconds so like pray for me
1706 2018-01-22 20:40:42 Your wrong and you sound like Trump. Africa is rich in Minerals, Gold and Oil. Your thinking in terms of land the size of Texas.
1707 2018-01-22 20:40:39 Why #Sirleaf chose to support the opposition  (Wanting her child to remain in #Liberia with a cabinet position- wanting some of surrogates to remain in their appointed positions.

1712 2018-01-22 20:39:59 people put olive oil in their brownie mix? that seems odd
1713 2018-01-22 20:39:54 Coconut oil clogs your pores. I didn’t know this either until my dermatologist told me to never use it on my skin about two years ago.
1714 2018-01-22 20:39:49 Trump stopped sending pallets of cash so they could upgrade their oil tankers too. Sad!
1715 2018-01-22 20:39:40 Every summer when it's all fresh... okra, corn, tomatoes & onions - sliced, diced & sauteed in olive oil, freshly ground blk pepper, pink himalayan salt, red pepper flakes & bay leaf or Old Bay. I eat seafood, so I sometimes add shrimp. #Delish
1716 2018-01-22 20:39:34 I like toasting mine in a pan with coconut oil
1717 2018-01-22 20:39:26 A exposição ao sol tende a provocar mais sebo na pele, potencializando a acne. Há casos também em que o uso de produtos inadequados – como cremes mais oclusivos – pode provocar o mesmo efeito. O uso de protetor solar oil free e sabonetes mais adstringentes é uma boa alternativa

1720 2018-01-22 20:39:19 What’s a good alternative to coconut oil? And where can i purchase it?
1721 2018-01-22 20:38:53 Yeah. Oil demands will go up for a very long time. No matter who you look at.
1722 2018-01-22 20:38:48 And I forgot to buy carrot oil when I went to Walmart

1729 2018-01-22 20:37:33 I support women's rights because I voted for the Woman who ran against Trump who was not offering to bomb whole countries for Saudi Oil money.

1733 2018-01-22 20:37:07 A OIL BURN
1734 2018-01-22 20:36:58 I guess because olive oil is only made in a few regions in the world, it carries a hefty price tag.
1735 2018-01-22 20:36:49 Yesterday I got my oil change today I appiled for my passport, is this what adulting is?
1736 2018-01-22 20:36:45 He glanced over his shoulder, eyes running down to the boots. 

Well, it wasn't his house.

"No. But I've got booze. Good stuff, too." 

Lamps always filled with oil get flicked on by tail or hand as Kong walks further in. 

"Right. Here's good." He pulls a pillow from the -
1737 2018-01-22 20:36:32 Don’t care what you are , welcome to talk to you . I would agree oil’s days are numbered and we need to look elsewhere for the world’s fuel . I hope renewable’s work as part of a broader mix
1738 2018-01-22 20:36:31 My mom was cooking with hot oil and she dropped a taco into the oil, and i got oil on my stomach and l screamed and now I’m here hi hello
1739 2018-01-22 20:36:21 Are you unhappy with your body wash because it dries your skin out ? Put a few tablespoons of baby oil in it. Shake before each use!

1741 2018-01-22 20:35:59 I need oil change bad lol
1742 2018-01-22 20:35:56 Oil! The organic coconut oil works best for me but anything, really. Also the ones WIBD make work, too!
1743 2018-01-22 20:35:39 The murder of the Kurds is a human right's violation,  but oil and power doesn't care how much blood is spilled.

1745 2018-01-22 20:35:35 Yes, I can "decode" his speeches. He uses "arcane literary references" to greenwash anti-environmental policies, including #DeltaTunnels, a #BigOIl-written cap-and-trade program, expanding offshore oil drilling by 17% in state waters & bringing #Deltasmelt closer to extinction.
1746 2018-01-22 20:35:32 Great job Mr. President!  Today’s headline: 5 workers missing after oil rig explodes in Oklahoma. So much for rolling back regulations.

1749 2018-01-22 20:34:46 I wish water and coconut oil could solve all my problems but it just won’t. 
1750 2018-01-22 20:34:43 Snake oil is a true liberal idiot he finds himself funny for doing a count down to block people but what he is really doing is losing cause he doesn’t have the balls to go head to head with these people so he’s a coward. Now block me whiner with your make believe nazi accusation.

1755 2018-01-22 20:34:21 Yes, in fact it was the British Empires need for oil (the US had oil) that drove them to propose this site for displaced Jews.They used Jewish refugee settlements as a gateway into oil-rich Palestine & the Middle East. The Brits often used human shields, like the Dutch in Canada.
1756 2018-01-22 20:34:03 Is this a nation? What's the definition of a Nation in your dictionary? A group of people who have same beliefs, culture etc, and you still claim Nigeria is a Nation just becos of oil and the heavy taxes paid by South Easterners (the entrepreneurs )
1757 2018-01-22 20:33:50 It sounds like a cliche but we do have more in common as humans...family, community, education, work and love. We just need a little more compassion & understanding focus on things which are important hungry, homeless, orphans, disabled or vulnerable. Elite focus $ war oil gold
1758 2018-01-22 20:33:49 Shit well then we need to find an oil well or 2 or find someone who owns a country full of them perhaps ...

1763 2018-01-22 20:33:06 Hi Peter, biodiesel is the name given to plant-based alternatives to diesel - it’s not actually diesel. The biodiesel we use is from recycled waste cooking oil. All the coaches run on it but the newer buses can’t so we’re converting them to electric. Two done, five to go 
1764 2018-01-22 20:32:59 Trump rolled back Obama restrictions on oil production.  immigration orders rescinded. Revisions to ObamaCare continue, Iran nuke deal awaits a similar fate.  Trump rules of engagement crush ISIS, US relationship with Israel is back 
Obama presidency-vanishing! @realDonaldTrump
1765 2018-01-22 20:32:47 I’m stood with head tilted to one side, warm olive oil sitting in my blocked eat canal, slightly tickling, fantasising about ear syringing.
1766 2018-01-22 20:32:43 Free market was what cause the crash because nations were supplying so much oil, the price fell down. So yes its anti free market

1770 2018-01-22 20:32:19 Mayo is actually pretty nutritious. Eggs and a lot of oil. Not very good to include into a regular diet but definitely good if you are starving.
1771 2018-01-22 20:32:16 I battle with excessive oil. I put so much in my hair and it seeps through my bonnet, ends up on my pillows and bomb I wake up with an oily face.

1781 2018-01-22 20:30:52 Thanks Spencer. YEah, I thought I saw a pattern of a notable sell off ahead of each of these. Prolly the summer one too and prolly having to do with commodities, especially oil - more so than stocks. We'll see if 2006 or more like 2011/2014!
1782 2018-01-22 20:30:38 Yes, not only leaving things alone, but educating yourself on the BS drs feed people to sell their snake oil and defraud men and parens.

1787 2018-01-22 20:30:11 I don't fast in the morning. That is not the issue, we are fat because we eat too much and the extra is all ultraprocessed food - starch, sugar seed oil combos. Eat protein for breakfast instead of sugar
1788 2018-01-22 20:30:08 Tamara just took the words out of my mouth. We don’t need an oil pipeline on the coast when the seconds are literally ticking before the Juan de fuca finally goes. Like we have to be so careful about putting more oil in our oceans.
1789 2018-01-22 20:30:06 also coconut oil has an ingredient that clogs pores which can cause breakouts yikes
1790 2018-01-22 20:30:01 Only on Newbury would u find a store that sells only Olive Oil

1795 2018-01-22 20:29:05 I personally like to see a focus on renewable energy, because to me it looks like oil is on its way out as an energy source. I don’t know if the price will sustainably return the levels of which extraction is viable.
1796 2018-01-22 20:28:36 Waited three hours for a oil change and tire rotation. Unacceptable @Toyota
1797 2018-01-22 20:28:33 When are you going to get the thanks you deserve for pushing lead tainted snake oil? You infomercial lead tainted snake oil sales men.

1805 2018-01-22 20:28:01 IMO changes to GDP/GNP in around 2011 boosted numbers artificially. Calculated by old metrics would have been lower
1806 2018-01-22 20:27:56 This man #Pence is as good at peacemaking as #Netanyahu - once again destabilisation allows the oil vultures in to the middle east
1807 2018-01-22 20:27:54 The high price is because oil producing nations decided to control the about of oil the supply
1808 2018-01-22 20:27:28 Sambisa Forest alone can accommodate all the Fulani cattles in Nigeria.
Therefore,cattle colonies pan Federation is pursuit of shadow at expense of the substance.We shld preoccupy we minds on hw to harness our bountiful solid minerals to boost GDP.This is real move away frm oil

1811 2018-01-22 20:27:07 Tea tree oil def helps with acne scars & everyone knows it burns but you need a carrier oil...oil in general clogs pores but some worse than others...aloe vera w tea tree or rosehip is any ones best bet I think

1813 2018-01-22 20:26:59 definitely oil and water. He’s definitely a Joe Budden type hater. But I did watch it all the way thru. It was lowkey entertaining. But that Star guy disrespected Fredo’s death (at the end) and I lowkey want someone to whoop his ass. He disrespectful af. Smh.

1828 2018-01-22 20:25:20 I would be far more supportive of LNG/Oil and Gas if we adopted a policy more like Norways. Where is Canadas 1trillion dollar rainy day fund from our resources? In the pockets of Hong Kong and New York investors?
1829 2018-01-22 20:25:17 I get it. We document a process and then have them execute... Anything from pricing oil changes to posting on Facebook, Twitter, etc. Nice to follow your career from a wannabe to a pro!

1833 2018-01-22 20:24:09 If we are due to hit our limit in 19 years, isn't it important to include methane in the calculations? Since it is set to go on for decades? Fracked nat gas and oil production is getting widely out of control in the US including drilling near/under homes, schools and parks.
1834 2018-01-22 20:24:08 When the midnight oil.
1835 2018-01-22 20:24:07 You forget Oil! The Thatcher era creamed the oil profits & shut British Steel at Ravenscraig when it was still profitable! She also shut the coal mines because of union power! She also killed British manufacturing! She decimated our industry!

1841 2018-01-22 20:23:47 Hopefully you talk about the hidden battle over mineral rights and excavation on public lands. Look to the @WorldBank and their decision to no longer loan on oil speculation. The push for rare earth minerals is already here while we discuss deer and oil...

2007 2018-01-22 20:03:25 Good point. I read Art of the Deal years ago actually. I'll have to re-read it after I finish your latest.

2027 2018-01-22 20:01:21 Agreed, fuck that dude.  We're already on par with Saudi Arabia in oil production since January 2017, and the higher that goes, in concert with endless sanctions against Russia, the deeper his grave gets.  We should have had the nuts to evict them from Crimea when they crossed.

2040 2018-01-22 19:59:48 Peace & Calming!!! This oil is my favorite because it put's me at ease when I'm stressed out. It also helps my entire family with sleep. I didn't know how I survived before my Young Living Essential Oils!

2043 2018-01-22 19:59:18 typically though if you're dry as FUCK LIKE ME, it's recommended/suggested to use an oil and a lotion/cream!! i just haven't figured out the steps yet bc my skin doesn't absorb oils well.. and obvsly that creates a barrier that lotions can't sink in to either 
2044 2018-01-22 19:59:08 How typical oil, history, stadium, fan base comments...You can’t talk football so you recite all the same crap over and over.

2051 2018-01-22 19:57:54 Does Jamaican black castor oil work?
2052 2018-01-22 19:57:50 i'm not sure of the exact effectiveness... oil is definitely more concentrated so once you figure out which ingredient(s) work for you, they're super useful. plus depending on which it is, they're either used as moisturizers OR sealants since some penetrate better than others

2062 2018-01-22 19:56:53 It's the wall dopes! If this was a car we would not keep pouring in oil until the engine froze, brake fluid until we could no longer stop our car or listen to the metal grinding until a wheel fell off! Why leave holes in our border until we find out what disaster that brings us?
2063 2018-01-22 19:56:42 To be fair, with this one, the house wasn't on the grid.

2077 2018-01-22 19:55:19 Electricity is cheaper and far more efficient than Oil. What are we purchasing oil for? The oil consumed for electricity is more that transportation. Oil is a source of energy so also is Electricity. But one is so important that we have to purchase one to get the other.
2078 2018-01-22 19:54:56 Oh my God, ban drilling just as we replace The Saudis as top oil producer. Remember when they had us over a barrel? Pun intended.

2090 2018-01-22 19:53:07 Yes. You know this is the republiCon way: Blow smoke up the ol wazoo and soothe the rash and burns with snake oil.
2091 2018-01-22 19:53:00 All based on an assumption that taxes and duties collected today on oil won’t be replicated on renewable energy. When a Govt loses revenue from one source it is inevitable that it will gain the shortfall from its alternative. Noting that we haven’t put a price on carbon per se.

2103 2018-01-22 19:51:37 @EPAScottPruitt USEPA's oversight & regulations regarding 40 CFR UIC program needlessly cost the oil & gas industry hundreds of million of dollars. USEPA's definition of freshwater, i.e., 10,000 mg/l is extremely overbearing, causing hundreds of oil & gas wells to be shut in.

2106 2018-01-22 19:51:21 My tip is to put the handful of raw almonds directly into the microwave for about 2min 15sec (time may vary depending on microwave), this roasts them perfectly. Then in a small bowl I add two drops of olive oil and a sprinkle of smoked paprika. Toss it through and eat while warm.

2109 2018-01-22 19:51:03 *nodding, I pull the chicken breasts from the breading mixture and put them into the heated oil, then I turn to look at you* earlier you said pet to me... is that what you want?

2112 2018-01-22 19:50:53 IMO it's no accident that the three bottom provinces are all oil and gas resource Reliant. Recent oil recession impacted disposable incomes the most. Lots of elasticity in what people are willing to spend outside of necessary expenditures. #ableg #abpoli

2116 2018-01-22 19:50:42 I’m sure we will have plenty of things to talk about! Everything from oil rigs to Ali Express, to plants, to lack of etiquette on social media... and more no doubt.

2118 2018-01-22 19:50:25 Apparently they invested oil revenue so extensively that interest now exceeds direct oil revenue.
Perhaps you have used Norwegian money.

2122 2018-01-22 19:50:23 .@EthanolRFA on PES - There is no factual basis to suggest the financial woes of PES are a consequence of the RFS. Wall Street analysts, academic researchers, EPA officials, and even some other oil refiners have said repeatedly that RINs don’t negatively affect refining margins.

Everything ends in a bubble of some kind whether it's oil, mortgage-backed securities, etc. What's the implosion of social media going to look like I wonder? Won't be gentle

2143 2018-01-22 19:48:32 It was an expensive day, but I got the oil changed in my husband's car, a replacement ceiling fan purchased for the boys' room, and new tires on the truck. Just a side note, new tires make a huge difference.

2149 2018-01-22 19:47:58 Of course it should. The argument that weed is a dangerous drug is an invalid talking point from 2 generations ago. Why was it illegal? To help the pharmaceutical, oil, and alcohol industries primarily but also so the right wing could target political opponents and minorities.

2153 2018-01-22 19:47:02 Pot is NOT safe. A 15 yrs study which recently concluded begs to differ. Even "moderate" smoking of weed is quite harmful in multitude of ways, including killing brain cells. Ingesting is only slightly less harmful. Oil (THC extracted) is a much better alternative medically.

2157 2018-01-22 19:45:46 Not for those that put gas in their fuel tanks. Which is almost #everyone. $63 oil equates to .74 cent gasoline but for some reason we're paying as if it was $120/barrel. Our gas is priced in USD. #WHY

2195 2018-01-22 19:42:18 Nah I'm good lol. I'm a licensed esthetician I know what im talking about. Coconut oil is coconut oil. It's fatty acids. It doesn't exfoliate. AHA's and BHA's exfoliate. Chemical exfoliatants are salycilic, glycolic, lactic, azleic, vit A, vit C, or enzymes. Not coconut oil.
2196 2018-01-22 19:42:09 But, but, but I read the Sun last weekend and it said Alexis had sacrificed his principles and morals and everything for money. Like he was going off to play friendlies for Oil Barons rather than coming to England's most successful and best supported club..?

2200 2018-01-22 19:41:43 Oh ok. Maybe that's not the Yoruba word for it. Some people were called out on my FB keto group for selling palm kernel oil as C.oil. apparently, it's not safe for consumption. Especially in the amount Keri ppl consume C.oil..
2201 2018-01-22 19:41:39 It will not go to zero... Anyone who used BTC before last year knows the reason for this:  in the same way that USD retained value because it was the reserve currency of petroleum, BTC will retain value because it is the reserve currency of the only commodity bigger than oil...

2229 2018-01-22 19:39:14 Maybe he’s born with it, maybe it’s Maybelline, maybe it’s oil.
2230 2018-01-22 19:39:14 Doesn't take into account the barrels of oil each one consumes every year to keep it lubricated. Fossil fuel is still required to run green energy. Now there is an inconvenient truth.
2231 2018-01-22 19:39:08 Funny how this Political candidates in their campaigns would still share bags of rice, then increase the price of oil to collect the money for the bags back.. garri, sugar and groundnut. They won't even share pour water to go with it

2246 2018-01-22 19:37:51 I think so too! It's just dermatologists HIGHLY recommend to stay away from coconut oil even if it is a skin oil because of what it does to your skin. Mine told me that it just depends on skin sensitivity sometimes which might be why I had such a bad reaction to it.
2247 2018-01-22 19:37:45 Can’t live without my teatree oil.

2250 2018-01-22 19:37:08 Changing my oil come summer time.
2251 2018-01-22 19:36:56 If you don't have an oil termometer, you can gauge the temperature of the oil by putting an ice cube in the pan #LifeHacks
2252 2018-01-22 19:36:35 My mom putting coconut oil in my hair is one of lifes greatest pleasures
2253 2018-01-22 19:36:35 What's in the media lately:
-Drought
-Eskom
-Deaths
-The 1%

What's not in the media:

-They MAKE rooibos cappuccinos

Open your God damn eyes people. Big oil is poisoning our society.
2254 2018-01-22 19:36:34 It's a reasonable move, burning oil to get electricity if you have alternatives - we sure have 'em - is nonsense.
2255 2018-01-22 19:36:30 I am amazed. How long does it take for other Christians to see that are snake oil salesman?
2256 2018-01-22 19:36:27 Some things like oil prices @A_Littlefair can’t control but I will say the media component has been lacking for the natural gas trucking industry. You never see any coverage on natural gas trucking on news and financial networks.
2257 2018-01-22 19:36:17 Are #MUFC the biggest club in the world? It’s hugely subjective but we are certainly in the top three. Players will always want to play at the Theatre of Dreams. History is earned over decades. The clubs built with oil money simply don’t have the same allure or prestige.
2258 2018-01-22 19:36:15 Baby oil??
2259 2018-01-22 19:36:10 @aerincreer welp sis just confirmed everything I needed to know about coconut oil.
2260 2018-01-22 19:36:09 Ingredient:

1 Oinion
500 Pineapple Piece
1 Gallon Canola Oil
5 Cocoa Butter Stick
2261 2018-01-22 19:35:57 so a chart can predict if there is oil in commercial quantities, because that's what this share comes down to. That and sentiment.
2262 2018-01-22 19:35:56 Abortion is murder IN YOUR RELIGION....move in with the Taliban....this is America no America bubba....
2263 2018-01-22 19:35:41 Ah, 350-400 times to get out of snowball state, found it. Good thing there weren't huge oil reserves at the time, or were couldn't have come out of snowball.
2264 2018-01-22 19:35:25 Dem leadership, once again, incompetent, spineless. Sen Warner, you are most complicit. Truth, justice, families, healthcare, education, jobs systematically exterminated by Ryan/McConnell (snake oil salesmen). Divided, we fell again. New leadership!
2265 2018-01-22 19:35:17 He didn't join City for anything bar money. The club has become semi-relevant this season only, before that, they just used their Arab oil money to get good players. Pep is bigger than City.
2266 2018-01-22 19:35:13 My site is back up and running smoothly.  Check my profile for Myclub8.  Hemp with Cam.  CBD OIL WITH OUT THC.
2267 2018-01-22 19:35:12 Try a non psychoactive thca cannabis tincture 
If that doesn't work, shift to a full spectrum cannabis oil extract.
Ssri didn't work for me either.
Oil helps.
2268 2018-01-22 19:35:08 I agree with that but i use coconut oil and drunk elephant moisterizer and my face is clear af #lrt
2269 2018-01-22 19:34:49 I feel like the big kid again like when we signed @vancole9 and then Wazza. I wanted him at United so much but in current climate with oil money i didn’t think it would happen.
2270 2018-01-22 19:34:47 OIL DIFF: 5.45 -> 5.52
2271 2018-01-22 19:34:44 Am I reading it right? @SenSchumer is trusting the word of a snake oil sales man? #DACA #shutdown2018 #caved
2272 2018-01-22 19:34:30 YYYEEESSSS THEYRE GONNA CHANGE YOUR LIFE just make sure you drizzle enough oil on and bake them long enough so they're nice and crispy hehe
2273 2018-01-22 19:34:28 I know that there's different types and I've had problems with some types and others not. Like I think some companies make coconut oil that is food grade (not too great for topical use) and others for your skin? Don't quote me on it though! Just my experience!
2274 2018-01-22 19:34:24 Please help endangered orangutan monkeys by donation what you can to: @bornean_OU & boycotting palm oil that isn't sustainable! Together we can help save them from the deforestation in which they are captured by palm oil plantation workers and sold as illegal pets or prostituted.

2277 2018-01-22 19:34:15 I am focusing on the production of military and capital goods that are used for the production of heavy machines. My plan is going to quadruple the production of heavy machinery and will double the oil production. #RiseToPower
2278 2018-01-22 19:34:03 I’ve been to Norway and Scandinavian countries. They’ve been oil rich a long time. They r not us, we can’t be them.Their govt basically takes your money and gives it back to you at the right time & provide everything. If oil sales decreased? I don’t know

2282 2018-01-22 19:33:24 Yeah the tide pod challenge is cool but when are people gonna start making chocolate milk with used motor oil? That’s the challenge I wanna see
2283 2018-01-22 19:33:16 Yeahhhh I thought so. Lotions don't work as well as oil in terms of moisturizing huh?

2289 2018-01-22 19:31:47 People are telling op that coconut oil helped and she's telling them it probably wasn't that that didn't. Like hun, sometimes things that don't work for you work for others? Since we all have different skin? Some things are universal and some aren't

2293 2018-01-22 19:31:27 Agree on the reserves, but I believe the output predictions are being too aggressive in estimating the oil service industries ability to unluck DUC's.  The IP decline outpaces completions, especially if you have a large group of new, hi-graded wells, as the base case on prod.

2316 2018-01-22 19:28:41 Evening things get intense. I'm big on exfoliation and anti-aging, so I hit hard w serum. I layer the Lactic Acid under Hyaluronic Acid, then use the 5% Granactive Retinoid, Ferulic Acid and 30% Vitamin C, cover w glossier moisturizer & seal w rosehip oil.
2317 2018-01-22 19:28:37 for individual pimples i use tea tree oil and it really works for me, i used to get it from the body shop but the quality wasnt good or something and it make my skin so red but now i literally just get it from the pharmacy and i find that it only dries out the pimples not my skin
2318 2018-01-22 19:28:13 Ugh they are taking forever with my car. Apparently it was leaking a billion fluids and had no oil bc it leaked it all out. I show up when they tell me it will be ready. An hour later still waiting 
2319 2018-01-22 19:28:08 @DailyHealthTips What is your view with regard to using CBD Oil for health benefits?
2320 2018-01-22 19:28:08 Put some baby oil onto it and let it draw in. You should be able to slowly remove it without or at least with a lot less pain then.
2321 2018-01-22 19:28:07 lmao when you're black and you've got dry ass skin on top of that you get used to using oil

2326 2018-01-22 19:27:28 This is kinda predatory and gross so how about no.

I already have community and support, I don't need random snake oil vendors interrupting my venting sessions to offer unsolicited advice.

2328 2018-01-22 19:27:15 Fact without oil money they would be mid table obscurity...in the championship
2329 2018-01-22 19:26:59 I know how to read charts and I can explain how to read this one: 
Oil=price goes up
No oil= price goes down
2330 2018-01-22 19:26:56 Saudi Arabia is among the few nations on Earth in which their electricity generation is mostly oil powered. If they switch to nuclear, they will have more oil available for exports.
2331 2018-01-22 19:26:55 But holy moly it's it ever annoying when people are like "I'm so oily!! I couldn't imagine ADDING oil to my face!! Hehe!!" THATS WHY YOURE SO OILY! MOISTURIZE YOUR FACE.

2342 2018-01-22 19:24:49 Coconut oil is really really good at taking off makeup and softening your hair but it also breaks a lot of people out so I'd be wary of keeping it on my face for a prolonged period of time D:

2346 2018-01-22 19:24:03 It is more dry than before. The color did work and it looked pretty, but I had to use a ton of hair oil to make it soft again. I have bleached my hair before though. That could be why.

I that “the national government and I were open to extending the cease-fire... and negotiating a new one. “ They will be dealt with
2350 2018-01-22 19:23:42 He remains so, these days soccer is about the money. Chelsea success was all built on oil money when Baba Roman took over. It's the trend now, anyone can move for the "right" price
2351 2018-01-22 19:23:32 Meanwhile, we can’t find healthcare for poor kids, but we can spend more than the rest of the world combined on military expenditures. We can subsidize oil and corn, but sick kids and kick rocks.

2362 2018-01-22 19:22:19 LRT not to mention coconut oil is a comedogenic oil so it'll clog your pores and end up break you out. contrary to popular belief coconut oil can't be used for everything

2364 2018-01-22 19:22:11 Yes. Totally worth it. End result is very satisfying.  I also soak my feet in espsom salts, dash coconut oil and lavdr esential oil then use foot scrub and moisturize.
2365 2018-01-22 19:21:58 Your message is shameful! You're a snake oil salesman who needs to stop preaching to you father's choir. #Dreamers do count!
2366 2018-01-22 19:21:34 A 500g tub. A lot cheaper than pip& nut, meridian and the likes. Nutella is cheap because it’s first ingredient is sugar and second is vegetable oil. You really do get what you pay for!
2367 2018-01-22 19:21:23 Crude Oil may be..a gift and a curse all at once

2369 2018-01-22 19:21:10 And then the U.S.A. wanted cheaper oil so they help over through the democratically elected government and installed their puppet who was then over thrown by the religious nuts that are still in power to this day. Just one reason the Middle East hates America....

2371 2018-01-22 19:21:07 Poverty and mental illness is the cause of most of our violence. Gun control snake oil won't help any of that. #gunsense
2372 2018-01-22 19:20:48 just used coconut oil as a moisturizer and my face is thanking me i haven’t used coconut oil in so long
2373 2018-01-22 19:20:45 coconut oil is for hair and body. NOT THE FACE!!
2374 2018-01-22 19:20:40 Oil change taking fahevaaaa
2375 2018-01-22 19:20:32 For some reason most Islamic states & ppl live in misery & suffering no democracy killing each other & terror everywhere
No contribution to science technology
The only wealth is oil 
I feel sorry for my Muslims brothers
2376 2018-01-22 19:20:22 Thank fuck my ears sometimes make up for my terrible memory. Forgot I was cooking something on pan in kitchen. Totally forgot about it, but heard the oil crackle for a second there through headphones from 2 rooms away.
2377 2018-01-22 19:20:19 More too come from Schaeffers oil Illinois and Germany
2378 2018-01-22 19:20:11 @TheAishaJibril Unfortunately both the FG & the Kwara state govt are focused solely on crude oil neglecting tourism.
2379 2018-01-22 19:20:00 #GNatWFFS Ariston Tuscan Herbs infused olive oil is wonderful 4 grilling your meats, chicken or tuna steaks. #WFFS18
2380 2018-01-22 19:19:59 Proszę durnot nie opowiadać, nie ma żadnych dowodów na skuteczność tego leczenia. A jeżeli są lekarze którzy to stosują to powinno się ich zgłosić do OIL
2381 2018-01-22 19:19:55 Thanks Jay. I'm assuming for "w/fat" coconut oil would be good?
2382 2018-01-22 19:19:52 shoutout to castor oil for helping me restore my eyebrows
2383 2018-01-22 19:19:26 Twitter propaganda by the greediest industry in the world right there with oil.

2387 2018-01-22 19:19:17 Grad school stress + coconut oil for hair/skin moisture literally ruined my life 
2388 2018-01-22 19:19:08 6 ppl seated around a table appearing to be doing shots of olive oil

2392 2018-01-22 19:18:44 Strategic development of refinery capabilities in the Midwest and Texas have positioned the US to become the largest exporter of refined oil and gas.

2394 2018-01-22 19:18:28 @RioTwit @bob_oil $WFT was still down -2.88% YTD underperforming their larger Oil Services counterparts but sentiment will shift after ERimo
2395 2018-01-22 19:18:24 "My oil change was over fucking $100..I'm thinking for what? I was bout to tell that nigga to give me my shit & I'll go put olive oil in it"

2397 2018-01-22 19:18:07 @bitcoingold @ethereumproject what is the short term and long term effects of increasing #oil prices on #cryptocurrency
2398 2018-01-22 19:18:05 Funny how it was the Obama administration trying to reset relations with Russia and not givingAF about the murder of CIA assets in China, while Trump is happily expanding oil production (to Russia's chagrin) and threatening trade barriers to China. Reality doesn't work for you.
2399 2018-01-22 19:17:50 Gettin a oil change
2400 2018-01-22 19:17:50 And coconut oil gets even permanent makeup off! 
2401 2018-01-22 19:17:31 Make sure you do the coconut oil thing tho otherwise it doesn't count
2402 2018-01-22 19:17:26 Star & Akedemiks? That's a seriously weird & odd combo. Oil & water lol
2403 2018-01-22 19:17:24 Coconut oil
2404 2018-01-22 19:17:20 @txrrc when do you expect to publish prelim Nov oil production data?  Eager to compare to EIA data.  thanks.
2405 2018-01-22 19:17:16 You simply can't wipe the smarm off the faces of guys like Nunes and Gaetz.  Not even with your coconut oil.
2406 2018-01-22 19:17:14 Not only do I not want you to have access to our Tidewater I don’t want an LNG to have access to it either or Kinder Morgan not because I’m against oil but bcuz I’m against oil spilling in the sea. I am also opposed to fracking bcuz it causes groundwater pollution & earthquakes.
2407 2018-01-22 19:17:06 Honestly if coconut oil messes with your skin THAT much, you might be allergic  just a thought.
2408 2018-01-22 19:17:06 Currently got mi head over steaming oilbas oil - ready for the night out 
2409 2018-01-22 19:16:59 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
2410 2018-01-22 19:16:58 Aren't churches just mining for money too. Look at all the crackpots on TV begging for money, selling books and vials of snake oil.
2411 2018-01-22 19:16:55 one thing i love about this game was when Laila put down oil Trap at the main lobby all i was doing is siding like a kiddo at some theme park when we was learned so much about the game day one but yet she still the best "1st" on every match that ends
2412 2018-01-22 19:16:55 will someone please tell the whites that sesame oil is only meant to be used in SMALL QUANTITIES and too much will completely ruin a dish
2413 2018-01-22 19:16:51 Daily Burn app is great. Keeps it from being boring because they're such a variety each day. Bulletproof Brain Octane Oil and Perfect Keto Powder both cause your body to go into ketosis which makes you burn fat for energy. I use both. It works.
2414 2018-01-22 19:16:48 Need to get up, go to the bank, go get a oil change, car wash & the nail shop & do laundry! 
2415 2018-01-22 19:16:42 This place is empty and yet no came to help me  bruh i just want an oil change lol
2416 2018-01-22 19:16:38 Coconut oil feels so weird to me so I don't touch it 
2417 2018-01-22 19:16:35 Okay I’m an idiot . I put windshield wiper fluid in my car this morning forgot to lock the pole that keeps the car propped up. So THAT was the noise I heard. Only had to pay 35 dollars for tire and an oil change 
2418 2018-01-22 19:16:12 I end with an oil usually a retinol as I am trying to speed the turn over of my skin I’m happy with looking like a red faced flaky if it means it’s working
2419 2018-01-22 19:16:10 Banning fracking only exacerbates the western dependency on arabia's oil. Very foolish mistake to repeat
2420 2018-01-22 19:15:55 AN ENTIRE TABLESPOON OF SESAME OIL?????
2421 2018-01-22 19:15:43 to each there own. Some people don’t have sensitive skin so it works. I hate the people that always say drink water and use coconut oil and your life will be perfect because this isn’t realistic for a lot ppl. I drink a gal a day and it certainly hasn’t made a difference for me
2422 2018-01-22 19:15:33 Fix stuck zippers with coconut oil! Just dip a cotton swap in some #coconutoil and rub it along the jammed #zipper to loosen it up.
2423 2018-01-22 19:15:29 If your salad contains fried chicken, bacon and ranch dressing, it is not going to help you lose weight. Go for grilled chicken and an oil based dressing instead! #MondayMotivation #WeightLoss

2425 2018-01-22 19:15:10 John, what are some of the main differences between Norway & us?
1. National Healthcare System
2. Public College for all
3. National ownership of oil resources.
4. They don't spend billions on "Defense" ie Military Industrial Wealth
Norway Denmark Finland ie the happiest people.
2426 2018-01-22 19:15:04 YAY! we need more oil wells more #Fracking and less regulation- friggin' @GOP @realDonaldTrump  do not give a shit.
2427 2018-01-22 19:15:00 @nailogical I NEED your help my nails are braking all the time but I know that the jojoba oil should help but I can’t buy it
2428 2018-01-22 19:14:57 bitch i had to learn the hard way....... ya girl don't fuck with coconut oil anymore
2429 2018-01-22 19:14:32 @SoCalTelevision #Media #News >> Mr. Schmertz promoted “advertorials” for Mobil Oil during the 1970... #More #FOLLOW #SoCalTelevision
2430 2018-01-22 19:14:31 Oh ...see how much I know!  

I use the baby oil gel, shit be giving me life! Lol
2431 2018-01-22 19:14:24 Barrel's empty, #Joe? Just remember Elijah & the widow's cruse of oil that never ran out. #TheArchers
2432 2018-01-22 19:14:17 Ahh sagaloo yup pretty good just mashed spinach few herbs little olive oil and Rogan josh yup it’s ok didn’t he play for Aston villa
2433 2018-01-22 19:14:16 How bad is it too change your oil yourself? It's not that bad right? I guess the worst part is you're now responsible for correctly disposing of the old oil. Can i just get a dang electric car yet or what
2434 2018-01-22 19:14:13 Dang I really like some of those oil paintings
2435 2018-01-22 19:14:12 Not sure what you're saying here;  Venezuela is oil rich country, with some of the worlds largest amounts of resources
2436 2018-01-22 19:14:11 On cotton round then some argan oil now it varies on day and time but I use a retinol and I have just a hyaluronic acid serum I have vitners daughter I have good genes I have that Stupid farsali bs with gold I havevolcano one (they suck btw I always breakout)
2437 2018-01-22 19:14:11 So I applied coconut oil on my mosquito bite it's no longer itchy
2438 2018-01-22 19:14:11 Only those that want to try and spin Trump as being a success use the stock market and unregulated corporations as good for average Americans. Not everyone buys their snake oil, particularly those of us dealing with massive oil spills and pollution where we live.
2439 2018-01-22 19:14:10 An oil rig has exploded and 5 people are reported missing in Quinton, Oklahoma.
2440 2018-01-22 19:13:58 Need that cod liver oil emoji
2441 2018-01-22 19:13:57 @ArtisanTropic, newly introduced to your plantain strips snack & it's delish! Thank you but Please stop using palm oil
2442 2018-01-22 19:13:50 It’s a whole lot easier to look like someone with a well-combed head of hair (per your analogy) when an oil state keeps giving you endless money
2443 2018-01-22 19:13:47 You can use it in an empty capsule (3-4 drops a few times a day) or you can mix it with your favorite lotion or carrier oil an apply on locations where you'd like it to be slimmer. Beware of sensitive skin though. ;)
2444 2018-01-22 19:13:46 I <3 Jim Lloyd he's such a dude @BBCTheArchers #thearchers
2445 2018-01-22 19:13:46 Putin's best deal is to keep the present venezuelan drug mafia in power. Ditto keeping Libia in chaos. Millons of barrels of oil supply cant reach the market...
2446 2018-01-22 19:13:43 Until you have family in the oil field you won’t respect it as much. Prayers for those involved in the explosion!
2447 2018-01-22 19:13:36 Finally took my car in to get the oil changed. The people in the waiting room next to me are having the least entertaining conversation I’ve ever eavesdropped on.
2448 2018-01-22 19:13:29 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.

2453 2018-01-22 19:12:57 Crazy how much the price fluctuates.  Especially when oil prices are down
2454 2018-01-22 19:12:54 Tame your headaches by rubbing peppermint oil like tiger balm to the temples.
2455 2018-01-22 19:12:39 coconut oil is gets my hair down my back so fast
2456 2018-01-22 19:12:33 Dropped the car off for a oil change and decided to uber to the store instead of waiting and let me just say “YALL CAN HAVE THIS SHIT”
2457 2018-01-22 19:12:13 신박한 드립 좀 쳐봐요
2458 2018-01-22 19:12:08 So I'm sitting in the tub right, enjoying my 6am soak, rubbing coconut oil on my titties. Figured I'd finally get around to watching Scream. And I'm just thinking, all these kids are so bougie! I'm rooting for the killer? Patio lights? I have to walk my patio in the dark!
2459 2018-01-22 19:11:52 I'm in the waiting room getting an oil change and soap operas are on and this kid next to me is having a soap opera of his own while on the phone, and it's really so awkward for me. I am about to walk out
2460 2018-01-22 19:11:51 Stripped, rewired and setup this Epiphone Wilshire and finished it with Danish oil and bee's wax polish @ Eds in the shed
2461 2018-01-22 19:11:49 - allowed oil/gas plants to hide safety information from the public (even after Harvey!)
- suspended a rule to allow more methane leaks into the atmosphere
- allowed more building of important infrastructure in flood plains
- stopped studying health effects of mountaintop mining
2462 2018-01-22 19:11:46 Currently Libya is like a jig saw puzzle that has been attacked with a very sharp axe.That is why Eto'o had to do it the way he did.The only thing working "properly" in Libya is the oil thievery business.
2463 2018-01-22 19:11:44 Wow!!  This is why I like making my weiners chicken or salmon with rice, fish oil, and peas or carrots with a little turmeric.  All natural, cheap, no diarrhea and they love it.  They do get canned on rare occasion but that sometimes ends badly.
2464 2018-01-22 19:11:40 This was a brand new well. It was actively drilling for oil.
2465 2018-01-22 19:11:38 Well, no, Tories took all the funding and so there's no decent infrastructure in most colleges .. magic funding pot needed
2466 2018-01-22 19:11:38 I think I just bought two oil paintings uh
2467 2018-01-22 19:11:36 Who is Nigeria jailing for oil theft and embezzlement!
2468 2018-01-22 19:11:34 Jojoba oil. Tea tree oil. Best things ever invented 
2469 2018-01-22 19:11:33 Weekly oil based hair mask,and daily biotin supplement is all you need.
Making sure you are getting enough vitamins is also important.

2478 2018-01-22 19:10:49 True. I honestly think the timing happened to coincide with the #ReleaseTheMemo bombshell & they thought it'd leak over weekend & they never dreamed President's messaging would be so laser focused or successful.
2479 2018-01-22 19:10:38 “#Africa no longer bright spark for attractive growth” says @NatznetOnAfrica. She cites concerns about burgeoning debt levels, growing interest rates, & stabilising oil prices. Urges prudence & fiscal management. #AfricaIn2018

2485 2018-01-22 19:10:14 They are un-mixable because the force of attraction between the individual liquids (oil and oil, water and water) is greater than the force of attraction between oil and water.
2486 2018-01-22 19:10:12 Oh fuck I hope those oil field hands are safe
2487 2018-01-22 19:10:11 Thinking about cleaning out my car, getting my oil changed, then hitting up a tattoo shop so they can draw up my tattoo design

2503 2018-01-22 19:08:13 We had a huge power outage at my apartment today. I'm talking the electricity lines sounded like shots being fired. I was so pressed to leave the house that I'm here disrespectfully ashy because I forgot to put on some coconut oil.

2511 2018-01-22 19:07:24 Do you think I got him going with all that sexy talk of acrylic vs oil paint? 
2512 2018-01-22 19:07:04 it honestly really depends on your skin and what it can tolerate but coconut oil is full of essential oil which can really irritate sensitive acne prone skin. Plus a lot of “ organic “ coconut oils have a lot of preservatives and additives that’s aren’t that great for your skin
2513 2018-01-22 19:06:52 Tide pods not only taste like shit and poison you, but they needlessly use petroleum to make the plastic casing and reinforce the monopoly the oil and gas industry has over resources 
2514 2018-01-22 19:06:52 I hope it does improve for you Ian 
2515 2018-01-22 19:06:37 I know miss Tracy oil grass girl yeehaw I sleep in my farm is white and voted for trump let’s move on
2516 2018-01-22 19:06:14 I only use coconut oil for my hair  couldn’t imagine putting that thick stuff on my face though 
2517 2018-01-22 19:06:01 The Islamic State would not have survived financially if Turkey had not been one of its first customers in the field of cotton, oil, etc. not to mention the jihadists transiting through Turkey. We must really question the ambiguous role of Turkey vis-à-vis Daesh
2518 2018-01-22 19:05:55 Can someone else go get my car's oil changed? I can't handle it
2519 2018-01-22 19:05:28 Why? So they can keep funding our efforts to kill all the women and children that are camped out with goats and tents on top of "all our oil", so that their young men hate us enough to kill us? Or is guarding Afghanistan's opium fields a more honorable, heroic mission?
2520 2018-01-22 19:05:26 The other half has a 4 year old panda and it's never been back to the dealers. It needed 2 tyres, a battery but it was only 30 quid and the rest was just oil changes in the drive. His last panda had a much more adventurous life...
2521 2018-01-22 19:05:10 Do you use an oils or leave in conditioner on your hair? That really can help! The winter weather makes my hair like that too but I use argan oil and leave in conditioner on the ends  and it goes away
2522 2018-01-22 19:05:07 The writedowns Pengrowth took on their BeverHill Lake tight oil were absolutely monstrous, all based on those assumptions.
2523 2018-01-22 19:05:05 1/And the problems were not instant - they came with the collapse of global oil prices. When 95% of exports are energy and it's 50% of GDP, even most fluctuations have massive consequences.
2524 2018-01-22 19:05:03 Aloes, castor oil
2525 2018-01-22 19:04:53 1c kale, scoop of protein, 1c almond milk, 1TBSP coconut oil, 1TBSP peanut butter, 5G of creatine and you've got yourself a nice little keto shake
2526 2018-01-22 19:04:53 OIL DIFF: 5.42 -> 5.48
2527 2018-01-22 19:04:46 It’s not like if you buy the makeup, you’re not allowed to buy the beard oil, or vice versa lololllll Certifeye isn’t the one saying that men can’t have both, but these people getting pissy over it are the ones presenting that idea
2528 2018-01-22 19:04:23 Perks of being ill: wake up to an oil massage, nice breakfast in bed, and Marvel movies all day 

I mean, I feel awful, but it’s kinda worth it.
2529 2018-01-22 19:04:12 Coconut oil makes your hair mad dry lmao better for roots but there's wayyy better shit like what you just mentioned.
2530 2018-01-22 19:04:06 And chili in olive oil!
2531 2018-01-22 19:04:01 Thanks Ron I’ll pick you up at the station with the baby oil
2532 2018-01-22 19:04:00 You know what I would do, I would stay and fight and try to fix it. Mexico has beautiful land, natural resources, fishing industry, oil. There is no excuse for them to be coming here. Stay there and make the country great. Fight against corruption.
2533 2018-01-22 19:03:59 Also, there's an almost immisibility between open source and paid labour - oil/water. Valuable things are sometimes made by people exploring, not by trying to solve a specific problem for a customer.
2534 2018-01-22 19:03:57 It's Tolbi seafood pasta！ With lots of olive oil and basil！（トレビ）
2535 2018-01-22 19:03:56 Will getting ur oil change get better with age or will I always feel like a 16 yr old girl that just got my license 
2536 2018-01-22 19:03:55 I'm against gov but also against selling investors snake oil SEC will knock on blockone's door if no KYC done on a $9 billion ICO obviously, i would rather EOS be clear & perform KYC & comply w/ the law instead of selling snake oil/being vague, then would have no issue w/ ICO
2537 2018-01-22 19:03:43 Actually do even better, jojoba oil is the closest oil to our natural oils in our skins so that’s the best thing to use on any skin type.
2538 2018-01-22 19:03:24 "... and Saudi Arabia has even more oil than we do but you know we didn't have the US ruining it for us like SA did" -my econ prof
2539 2018-01-22 19:03:16 Oh and cleansers are just as important - try removing makeup with almond oil or evening primrose oil, or Avene XeraCalm Cleansing Oil (but you can only buy it in a giant tub unfortunately!)
2540 2018-01-22 19:03:14 @claireperrymp For #BigEnergySavingWeek I've switched my 12 year old oil boiler for a new A rated efficient @myGrantUK boiler. Expensive investment but hopefully will save oil in the long run. Also supporting a local company based in Devizes. Looking forward to a warm house soon!

2542 2018-01-22 19:02:57 Some healthy fats are: almonds, coconut oil, olive oil, fatty cuts of meat, pecans, walnuts, fatty fish, butter, eggs, and avocados. Stay away from your hydrogenated vegetable oils, canola oil, soybean oil.
2543 2018-01-22 19:02:56 yeah ok oil wars are definitely not imperialism
2544 2018-01-22 19:02:44 I was able to use coconut oil for a moisturizer and it worked fine.
2545 2018-01-22 19:02:26 Am I supposed to hope that oil prices go back to the state.
2546 2018-01-22 19:02:23 Or at least he can't compete financially with the Middle East oil owners, and the club can't compete commercially with the big 3 (us, Arsenal, Pool).
2547 2018-01-22 19:02:18 @LuvMyBonds holding 10% FANG, for oil above 60, just leveled the GUSH (7.5%) & CHK (7.5%) reducing CHK a little bit per trend we see now
2548 2018-01-22 19:02:12 Comrade Trump the bone spur draft dodger has sold you snake oil and played you for a gump. You traded a good cow for magic beans.What's the chances that a moron with no impulse control and an abnormal lust for his daughter didn't cross that line? You're not stupid you are a moron
2549 2018-01-22 19:01:58 It was actually good... 

Too much oil but it was good

2556 2018-01-22 19:00:42 I can’t use coconut oil. It doesn’t do anything but break me out.
2557 2018-01-22 19:00:37 Let’s be clear. Multinational oil companies are selling Canadian oil sands back to Canadians at a loss to cut their losses. Some of them are investing the proceeds in renewable energy. The Canadians who finance such deals are neither savvy investors, nor are they climate leaders.
2558 2018-01-22 19:00:35 Yes. Aloe Vera & Avocado Oil Is Great. But Coconut Oil Def Has Many Health Benefits As Well. & It Does Moisturize. & Everybody’s Skin Is Different. What Works For One Person May Not Work As Well For The Next Person. It’s All About Finding What Works Best For You.

2568 2018-01-22 18:59:09 It very much seems like every snake oil salesman and ‘charity’ seems to have the answers to access the cash. Reminiscent of the heyday of anti-sectarian funding....

2571 2018-01-22 18:58:49 Trump never wanted to see drilling platforms from Mar-A-Lago anyway. It was a setup. He had batboy go to zinke so he couldn't be traced to it. The scenic view from Mar-A-Lago never included oil drilling platforms

2579 2018-01-22 18:58:08 For some reason most Islamic states & ppl live in misery & suffering no democracy killing each other & terror everywhere
No contribution to science technology
The only wealth is oil 
I feel sorry for my Muslims brothers
2580 2018-01-22 18:58:04 So U have no science background! & yet you are dismissing the shared knowledge of a Scientist & a Chartered Mechanical Engineer @IMechE with 30 Yrs + experience in Electric Power Generation; Oil & Gas! How is that?
2581 2018-01-22 18:58:02 The oil emersion lens is
2582 2018-01-22 18:58:00 The Democrats are socialists who call our troops baby killers, oil mercenaries, and all sort of names! They don’t care about troops. They. are about votes. Bunch of socialist agitators
2583 2018-01-22 18:57:57 i put too much coconut oil on my scalp once and i was dizzy for like 2 days because it clogged my pores :-)

2586 2018-01-22 18:57:41 Is it only me that sees Senate Leader McConnell when he stands behind the podium as a snake oil sales man. Always trying to sell something he knows will go no where and also a big lie? He has successfully merged the leadership of the Senate with Trump’s Administration!
2587 2018-01-22 18:57:38 BABY OIL! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

2591 2018-01-22 18:56:58 the vox piece shows oil priced in one unit and wind/solar in another (1)

so how the heck can you, or Anyone else, make any conclusions ???

am I missing something or are y'all just wrong ?

1) see table titled RFP responses by technology
2592 2018-01-22 18:56:48 You gon really look like a oil slick

2602 2018-01-22 18:55:57 i still don’t like canola oil
2603 2018-01-22 18:55:52 Learned this  the hard way. I basically expoliated my entire body, soaked in coconut oil, then like 2 days later, my arms were covered in bumps from the oil and the expoliation. Still itchy and it’s been a week, I feel like I have chicken pox on my arms  coconut oil is liessss
2604 2018-01-22 18:55:43 What an idea!! Same principal as for door keys..... Can’t oil them either... 
2605 2018-01-22 18:55:30 interesting.  a few years ago we were worried about peak oil supply.

2612 2018-01-22 18:54:32 yeah they have a couple & they’re really good! their pure truth youth activating oil is the most similar to Biossance’s vit c serum, & it’s $45 i think highly recommend  i just think biossance is a bit too expensive &there are definitely products that do the same for cheaper
2613 2018-01-22 18:54:21 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes
2614 2018-01-22 18:54:11 They haven’t started drilling yet. The price of oil isn’t high enough to make it viable.
2615 2018-01-22 18:53:51 Oil in the fire I remember how it used to be
2616 2018-01-22 18:53:47 people swear coconut oil does solve all of life’s problems
2617 2018-01-22 18:53:46 I use it on my body, not my face. I use vitamin E and rosehip oil on my face. But I have really oily, acne prone skin
2618 2018-01-22 18:53:45 I haul propane myself...oil burns much hotter than gasoline, diesel, and propane...if an oil rig blew then "hot" is an understatement

2623 2018-01-22 18:53:18 Wow this Royco ad ya steak ..please don't drizzle all that olive oil, cholesterol exists guys 
2624 2018-01-22 18:52:56 Getting an oil change and what not.
2625 2018-01-22 18:52:55 If the tuna Is in brine or springwater I'd eat it but if it's in sunflower oil bin it
2626 2018-01-22 18:52:53 Not really. Norway has 20x more oil income to distribute. Norway: 90,000 litres a day per 1000 population. Britain: 4,500 litres a day per 1,000 population. 2007 figures. I don’t agree with massive disparities in national wealth and income, but all solutions worse than problem.
2627 2018-01-22 18:52:47 This dude that finished doing my oil change has been trying to get one bolt in that holds up my skid plate for the past 15-20min....

Lmaooooooooooo he probably messed up the threads
2628 2018-01-22 18:52:43 That's because shitty people are running the country. I really don't wish this policies to anyone. And we got one of the biggest oil reserves in the world, minerals reserve like gold and bauxite and fertil land.
2629 2018-01-22 18:52:32 17:50. A44 junction with A4110 Bainstree Cross, Large Goods vehicle with split Hydraulics hose, oil on road way. @HWFireKingsland  in attendance. Care should be taken, slippery surface
2630 2018-01-22 18:52:16 Cause I honestly don’t think he has plans to get the oil changed.
2631 2018-01-22 18:52:05 I just lather the oil in my hands until it’s liquid, rub it on, and rinse it off! It’s great as a natural makeup remover too!
2632 2018-01-22 18:51:55 It's the squeaky wheel that gets the oil :-)
2633 2018-01-22 18:51:54 I put wayyyyyyyy too much coconut oil in my hair last night and now it’s hella greasy 
2634 2018-01-22 18:51:54 Warm Bread and Herbed Olive Oil is my signature Fragrance.
2635 2018-01-22 18:51:50 I had aches and pains in my body so I ran a hot bath.I put epson salt a peach bath bomb& baby oil in
But what I really need is a massage.
2636 2018-01-22 18:51:41 it hurts that some of beauty twitter doesn’t realize coconut oil is comedogenic and will fuck your face right up
2637 2018-01-22 18:51:40 Feel sorry for pep it’s not his fault city were hit with an oil embargo and couldn’t afford Sanchez.
2638 2018-01-22 18:51:39 Some oils are actually good and OK for oily skin types. Depending on the oil of course, like organic cold pressed rosehip oil is very good for the skin
2639 2018-01-22 18:51:34 
2640 2018-01-22 18:51:28 That was it.. Anything will do  for the bulls nowadays:)
2641 2018-01-22 18:51:23 guitar update: i painted it today finally. and started applying the oil finish. all it needs is 72,000,000 more coats with time to dry in between and it'll be an instrument again rather than a lump of wood.
2642 2018-01-22 18:51:21 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
2643 2018-01-22 18:51:09 Peak legislation, perhaps.  Not peak oil.
2644 2018-01-22 18:51:04 Allah Azwajal bestowed among the Ummah Trillions of Dollars through crude oil to economically empower them, 600 millions of the Ummah are in abject poverty while the bestowed trillions are not invested among the Ummah on a prudent & productive manner but kufr agenda reign supreme
2645 2018-01-22 18:50:54 Thats mainly due to the EU. The EU has ruined majority of countries in the EU. But again Venezuela has the most amount of oil than any othher country yet they are still extremely poor and have a planned economy. Thats corruption, the government there is extremely corrupted
2646 2018-01-22 18:50:40 Finally made it to Metra on Pulaski after many issues getting the rail car open to load the oil. 

This oil is thick. That combined with a 2” diameter hose, this is gonna be a long delivery. 

On the plus side, at least I had time to make a delicious corned beef and Swiss on rye.
2647 2018-01-22 18:50:36 Me: Yeas, no 7th period I get to go home!!
My car: Oil life -34% 
Me: (((: or not

2664 2018-01-22 18:48:32 I've been using coconut oil as "face cream" for a few years because it doesn't give me breakouts like regular face creams do
2665 2018-01-22 18:48:31 it’s like you want Roman to sell his oil well ni
2666 2018-01-22 18:48:16 Trouble peeling hard boiled eggs?  I have tried so many different suggestions.  Finally, one that really works!!! Add a tblsp or 2 of vegetable oil to the water then boil your eggs.  Shells come off so easily!  Yay!  Thank you to my daughter!!

2672 2018-01-22 18:47:37 I didnt say she governed, her husband did. Yes it is, do you prefer a free market or a planned economy? By the way, america has more of a free market and Venezuela has a planned economy. Venezuela also has the most oil than any other country yet they are so corrupted and poor.
2673 2018-01-22 18:47:34 If y’all like Rose infused oil, water, and face scrubs dm me !
2674 2018-01-22 18:47:27 You won’t get anything because you caved to that lying snake oil salesman @SenateMajLdr His word means nothing. He is a liar.
2675 2018-01-22 18:47:12 But most Oil were dumped from the "bus" around 2008.  Lowe continued.  Tambellini f'd it all up.  Horrible late '90's & early 2000's drafting by Sather & then Lowe didn't help.  Not sure where Boys on Bus edict comes in really.
2676 2018-01-22 18:46:56 Would a blood transfusion be an oil change? Are your shoes considered your tires or your feet? If headlights are your eyes, what are your taillights? Would you always want your rear bumper cracked? These are questions that need answers! 
2677 2018-01-22 18:46:47 That's why we need off-shore drilling, so that water will put out fire from explosions.....oh wait water and oil don't mix. Nvm : |

2690 2018-01-22 18:45:42 Do not place your trust in a snake oil salesman!
2691 2018-01-22 18:45:32 The reason I like the phrase 'data is the new oil' is because if we keep saying it, maybe we'll start to ask why we're giving it away for free.
2692 2018-01-22 18:45:23 NO DONT USE COCONUT OIL ITS ALL A LIE
2693 2018-01-22 18:45:14 I can almost guarantee they'll never be found...when oil explodes that means ridiculously high temperatures that makes a gas explosion look like child's play...instant vaporization temperatures

2697 2018-01-22 18:44:39 That's bullshit now we will have to pay more gas or oil that we send overseas. Thanks to these idiot governors who think this way. We are spending more on oil refinery sending our oil back across the ocean to other countries. Now we won't have the chance to save money.
2698 2018-01-22 18:44:37 Infinite blessings, gratitude and love to all

2704 2018-01-22 18:44:08 Since the oil money came, United spent more than City with no real success apart from the FA Cup win. There are only 3 big trophies for a Premier League side. UCL, PL and FA Cup in that order. Also, watch City play under the best manager in the world. It's a real treat.
2705 2018-01-22 18:43:30 Do u think #Sinkholes happen as we remove water, oil, etc. from underground?
2706 2018-01-22 18:43:28 You can't ban people, demonizing them treating them like terrorists then expecting enjoying money and oil coming from their land. All actions create reactions, that the basis of bond, of social tissue,
2707 2018-01-22 18:43:26  your head has oil
2708 2018-01-22 18:43:25 What are you talking about? Just cause someone is confused on how coconut oil is bad when you have multiple sources that says it’s not, but you say it is, but have no sources except your word..yeah you just wanna be argumentative

2710 2018-01-22 18:43:13 You should be more worried about the oil drying up .. don’t worry about us !
2711 2018-01-22 18:43:03 Pizza makes no distinction between vegan and non vegan food stuffs. Now calling coconut water or almond oil milk does.
2712 2018-01-22 18:42:49 Nothing will be done because Wibor Ross is in bed with Putin all he has to offer is oil. Mean while the pacific rim countries have made deals with China
2713 2018-01-22 18:42:32 I don’t use a toner, I’ll look into that, I used to just have dry skin with oil in my T-zone, but now it’s just oily and dry in patches everywhere?? I’ll probably end up going to a dermatologist.
2714 2018-01-22 18:42:25 It appears to be open house for any and all oil companies to get whatever they want any way they want and that includes fracking. What a mess were in.
2715 2018-01-22 18:42:25 Oil and gas companies are causing climate change.

2725 2018-01-22 18:41:14 Fuel scarcity in a country that have crude oil in large quantity shows that we are not ready to live a better life as people.

2727 2018-01-22 18:41:09 Atleast we aren’t using oil money ! 
2728 2018-01-22 18:41:07 An oil drilling rig has exploded in Quinton, Oklahoma and caught fire.
2729 2018-01-22 18:41:06 That'll be the English with near £2 Trillion of debt. No Scotland to service it, no oil, no whisky, nothing Scottish flogged as British. Aye
2730 2018-01-22 18:41:01 all the time. Typically follow the motor oil that @TeamHendrick uses, shop at lowes before Home Depot, Target over Walmart, @MonsterEnergy over Redbull or Rockstar, i stopped using 5hourenergy because fan of CB and not a HUGE fan of Erik
2731 2018-01-22 18:40:57 Sometimes the simplest pastas are the most delicious. Five ingredients: pasta, frozen broccoli, olive oil, garlic, Parmesan. Fine six if you count pepper.
2732 2018-01-22 18:40:48 I think I'm officially quitting coconut oil and converting to aloe vera oil/gel
2733 2018-01-22 18:40:44 I guess you shouldn't talk about this matter because I know you have little knowledge of the whole issues and manipulations going on
2734 2018-01-22 18:40:33 So @tedcruz is a lying snake oil salesman. Who knew?
2735 2018-01-22 18:40:27 Love it when you say, “a little bit of oil and vinegar” and they pour a half a gallon on your sub.
2736 2018-01-22 18:40:26 All the oil money dried up
2737 2018-01-22 18:40:25 Im using carols daughter shampoo & conditioner. But i use shea moisture black castor oil leave in conditioner
2738 2018-01-22 18:40:24 Yup that's right the same old snake oil salesman like @FrankLuntz selling the same old bullshit to some new new idiots
2739 2018-01-22 18:40:20 Wrinkles appear on the skin as you age when aging skin starts to lose  its ability to hold on moisture, makes less oil, and is slower to heal.  It also produces less collagen, and because collagen is what makes your  skin smooth and elastic, wrinkles start to appear.

2747 2018-01-22 18:39:13 YES. Also if people insist on using coconut oil on their lips, they should try a coconut oil based lip balm. The ones I make for my business are shea butter, coconut oil and soy wax. Its the shea butter that helps the lips the most in my balms

2749 2018-01-22 18:38:42 Changing oil filter (a cartridge type) on my wife's Buick Verano requires a special tool, unless you have very strong hands -- I do -- and can work them into a tight space around different lines.
2750 2018-01-22 18:38:17 While I was at work yesterday Tyler changed the oil in my truck, made dinner, cleaned, and had a glass of wine waiting for me.. fkn MCM

2753 2018-01-22 18:37:25 "Useless wall" a wall has worked pretty well for Israel. Mexico can still pay for the wall over time, there's been several plans to have them do so like paying them $5 less per barrel of oil for the next few years until we get our money back.
2754 2018-01-22 18:37:18 Israel with no oil is ahead of Saudi Iran and Egypt.
2755 2018-01-22 18:37:16 It should return to liquid in warmer temps. Place inside warm to hot pasta pot full of water and that should do the trick. The coconut oil surfactant is the reason it’s white and not flowing liquid in cold temps.
2756 2018-01-22 18:37:14 I got a free car wash with my oil change but the lady said ion have to use it today cause it’s bout to rain. That shit too clutch
2757 2018-01-22 18:37:07 I've heard aloe & sesame seed oil lol but you gotta wait a while to see the results
2758 2018-01-22 18:37:06 I used to mix mine with coconut oil and it would make my Bantu knots pop
2759 2018-01-22 18:36:58 Convenient?  Or just profitable?

It seems that everything automobile manufacturers do these days is to make it ever more difficult for people to work on their own vehicles. Changing oil filter on my F-150 would be easier for a left handed person.

2763 2018-01-22 18:36:37 Been putting mad coconut oil on my beard to get them lines back right

2785 2018-01-22 18:34:01 How is coconut oil made
2786 2018-01-22 18:34:00 I’m not shaming coconut oil but idk how y’all can put that on your face as moisturizer
2787 2018-01-22 18:33:59 Maybe use a gorgeous oil - walnut (theres a great supplier near Shipston). Or avoid trying to replicate meat & animal recipes & ingredients. Hummous is delicious as a spread or combo. Try something like tahini or closer to home hazel nuts blended to a paste.
2788 2018-01-22 18:33:50 3 cups flour 1.5 cups salt 6 tsp cream of tartar 3 cups cool water 3 Tbsp vegetable oil & food coloring Blend liquids together, then add in dry ingredients stir continuously over medium heat until dough pulls away from sides of pot & can be pinched without sticking ~5 mins...
2789 2018-01-22 18:33:37 I absolutely love using my airfryer - never fry chips anymore / fish fingers for beany; nuggets / fish cakes - in a flash and healthy (or healthier) because there isn’t oil involved
2790 2018-01-22 18:33:31 This is why auto dealers are toast in the EV future. EVs don’t need as much service: no oil changes, oil filters, gas tanks, no smog tests, no alternators, hoses, fanbelts, etc. So, by all means: focus more on service department revenue.
2791 2018-01-22 18:33:30 For me it has to using sunflower oil #NisaMonday
2792 2018-01-22 18:33:27 We sadly didn’t get picked for the top five of Very Big Indie Pitch, but our buddies at @oil_weedoor did and we are all super happy for them!
2793 2018-01-22 18:33:21 #FlavourHacks #NationalHotSauceDay put in a pan corned beef, chilli powder, chopped red chillies, crushes chillies, paprika, Encona Hot Pepper Sauce, diced onions, baby toms, rapeseed oil. Cook until corned beef is soft. Serve with pitta bread
2794 2018-01-22 18:33:18 How about #Organic Pure #Marula Oil?
2795 2018-01-22 18:33:11 It hasn't been as itchy as I thought it would be yet, but the beard oil would probably help make the hair less coarse though I'd guess.
2796 2018-01-22 18:33:02 About to spend all day at the car dealership getting my oil changed and inspection. Who wants to pick me up for lunch?
2797 2018-01-22 18:32:58 So.much oil amazing
2798 2018-01-22 18:32:57 Ibuprofen 30 mins before your wax, have your esthetician put pressure after every yank and put aloe Vera in areas waxed. Tea tree oil after to keep it smooth and looking nice!
2799 2018-01-22 18:32:50 I think castor oil would work great on yours. But you need to warm it a little first before you use it
2800 2018-01-22 18:32:14 Oil spill. two left lanes blocked in #Dallas on 35E SB at Wycliff Ave, stop and go traffic back to 183, delay of 6 mins #DFWTraffic
2801 2018-01-22 18:32:09 What about oil and gas companies?

2803 2018-01-22 18:32:03 Olive oil!!! Does wonders
2804 2018-01-22 18:32:00 Did they not clean up the mess that bush left. Now to have it all thrown away by deregulation’s  just so they can drill for oil in national parks no more clean water. No regulations on banks(another 2008 crash on the way) ???
2805 2018-01-22 18:31:54 Lol who told u
2806 2018-01-22 18:31:41 I used to put full on Almond Oil on as body lotion, I led a very oily smelly life
2807 2018-01-22 18:31:36 เกลียดความขี้หงุดหงิดใจร้อนของตัวเองมากก!!!!!!!!!
2808 2018-01-22 18:31:05 Auto-correct may have had that one right
2809 2018-01-22 18:30:53 CBD oil?
2810 2018-01-22 18:30:48 Slice thiny, toss into oven at 400f /200c with some oil and salt/pepper for 20 mins to start.  I like mine a little crunchy so if you like more cooked, add 5 mins.  You can add some spices but I like them straight up with spices on the meats :)

2813 2018-01-22 18:30:16 I've made a LOT of pumpkin bread in my life. But I just made what may well be the best, MOST MOIST pumpkin bread EVER. And? It has no oil and only 2 tbs light margarine!

The joys that come of trying to use up the jars of random BEST BY: 2014 ingredients in my fridge.
2814 2018-01-22 18:30:14 2017: yes coconut oil is so good for your skin

2817 2018-01-22 18:29:44 Oregano oil, olive leaf extract, Grapefruit seed extract, Aloe Vera, colloidal silver are all beneficial to help rid parasites.
2818 2018-01-22 18:29:35 coconut oil clogs ur pores!!! dont use it as a moisturizer!!

2824 2018-01-22 18:28:55 Ok but that's the washcloth that's exfoliating not the coconut oil lol
2825 2018-01-22 18:28:52 Don’t know about y’all but .. coconut oil works for my skin, face, and hair 
2826 2018-01-22 18:28:50 Made some bomb ass Oregano oil

2829 2018-01-22 18:28:25 
2830 2018-01-22 18:28:20 A great start of the year for divest-invest with NYC deciding to divest and to sue big oil for climate damages, and Loyd‘s of London following suit. Today, the Europeans for Divest-Invest met and set a new target of $20 trillion divestments by 2020 to slow #climatechange
2831 2018-01-22 18:28:12 So she puts the Essential Oil on her hands, then washes her hands. Seems kinda pointless.
2832 2018-01-22 18:28:11 Hahahahahaha  City have nothing on us but oil money Manchester will always be red City will never reach the amount of success United have had
2833 2018-01-22 18:28:10 A good way to get some good healthy fats in your diet is by drinking a bulletproof coffee which consists of a TBSP of butter, TBSP of coconut oil/MCT oil, and a TBSP of heavy whipping cream all blended in your black coffee

2835 2018-01-22 18:28:00 #US even cannot decide either to support #democracy or #dictatorship! In #egypt and #KSA, they support dictatorship, in #Iraq and #Syria, they support democracy. Soon we will ask you the amount of gold and oil taken from iraq, and lithium from Afghanistan
2836 2018-01-22 18:28:00 Y’all insist that coconut oil isn’t good for the face but y’all forget that everyone’s skin ain’t the same. Your body won’t react to shut the same way that others will and that’s just a fact. Y’all not dermatologist, y’all gotta relax
2837 2018-01-22 18:27:55 My son has bad excema & i am fed up of using steriod creams on him. I was recommended pur coconut oil but it did not work for him at all 
2838 2018-01-22 18:27:54 When it's seems like my hair has turned to straw overnight, I melt in the microwave ultra refined shea butter (raw shea butter crystalizes too quickly), liquid oil like avocado or jojoba & lil bit of cocoa butter. Apply thick while smoothing hair cuticles down
2839 2018-01-22 18:27:49 DURI CITY OIL
2840 2018-01-22 18:27:46 Put some coconut oil on your face, take a washcloth and rub in a circular motion. It'll exfoliate and moisturize at the same time.
2841 2018-01-22 18:27:39 Everything about coconuts is amazing coconut water, coconut milk, coconut oil, the smell of coconuts, I love it all
2842 2018-01-22 18:27:34 Kids talking about making his 98 corrolla RHD.. u can’t even do an oil change
2843 2018-01-22 18:27:27 January gas prices soar, hitting a four-year high. The state average in Florida just hit $2.54, matching it to the national average. AAA Spokesman, Mark Jenkins, says the recent oil price rally is to blame, but that prices should start to level out within the week. @WUFTNews
2844 2018-01-22 18:27:22 Alexis has gone from playing with Messi to

Mans bout to discover oil.
2845 2018-01-22 18:27:19 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
2846 2018-01-22 18:27:18 I hope for some scenes that resemble the "Indian Ocean" scene from BvS in sound, tone and colorgrading.

Will we see a connection with the Oil Rig scene from MoS?
2847 2018-01-22 18:27:17 I learnt this first hand  I used pure coconut oil for about two weeks and I have never been ashier. I have dry skin. I had to switch to shea butter. 
2848 2018-01-22 18:27:09 good after came get a oil change for $15.99 and inspeccition free here at racing muffler 2157 N Cicero Ave Chicago IL 60639

2849 2018-01-22 18:26:54 Fuck coconut oil that shit made me break out so bad and now I have tons of acne scars
2850 2018-01-22 18:26:37 I been saying this for years...stop replacing hair products or lotion w coconut oil you can use it in addition to but not as a replacement but whatever.
2851 2018-01-22 18:26:33 Hm. If I wanted to understand Venezuela I’d start with the capture of the military and political class by narcotrafikers and Cuba, plus the distortion of massive oil rents insulating the government from demands of the middle class. The comparison to the US polarization seems weak
2852 2018-01-22 18:26:11 Jojoba oil works really well on my skin.(never my face ) I've tried coconut oil on my face and it was a disaster.. in a sugar scrub it doesn't  make me breakout for some reason though. Either way, I have learned and moved on from that mess. 
2853 2018-01-22 18:26:09 They get paid to cave by Wall Street, Big Pharma, Big Oil, it goes on and on and on. 6 THOUSAND lobbyists worked on the Tax Scam. You think they only buy Republicans? LOL. We have to completely clean house. Please support @justicedems & candidates like @Ocasio2018 @paulajean2018
2854 2018-01-22 18:26:07 I could see for a house (sort of?) but wow, just an apartment? A lot of massive places have been sold to oil money but those prices are stunning even by Paris standards.
2855 2018-01-22 18:25:59 That’s comparing year-end numbers to UVa’s mid-season peak level. Would be more compelling to compare apples to apples. Not sure if still holds true. And let’s not break out the anointing oil quite yet - there are still a lot of tough games left.
2856 2018-01-22 18:25:57 Schumer**  damn auto-correct
2857 2018-01-22 18:25:51 Your analysis is correct and your concerns are well founded. Oil will be in the next 10-15 years like coal is now - limited by regulation but prices will reflect supply/demand if the then low cost producers and marginal consumers. But it won’t disappear overnight
2858 2018-01-22 18:25:45 Oil price?
2859 2018-01-22 18:25:43 You need wash your hair once ever two weeks and co-wash in between washes. After washes/co-washes you need to make sure you are moisturizing your hair. So oil your scalp (Jamaican caster oil) , the a cream (leave in conditioner or moisturizer), then a light gel . . .
2860 2018-01-22 18:25:40 two hours for an oil change? 
2861 2018-01-22 18:25:29 What does that even mean? In a season or 2 what are you expecting? Us to be bought out by oil diggers? For the new stadium to increase revenue enough that we compete with Man City, UTD, the scum, Pool financially?
2862 2018-01-22 18:25:22 They said this nigga Meech poured some oil on some nigga fake Prada’s and said it was for the dead niggas 
2863 2018-01-22 18:25:15 That and Schemer was convinced it would be an embarrassment to the President.....turns out President and America fought back and Schemer blinked.....
2864 2018-01-22 18:25:11 Rose hip seed oil keeps the face from drying out
2865 2018-01-22 18:25:11 @chrissyteigen maybe I’m just dumb but I can’t find chili oil anywhere?????
2866 2018-01-22 18:25:08 He would be taking a bath in oil inside etihad airplane
2867 2018-01-22 18:25:02 Why not just take over Mexico? Our military could destroy the drug cartels, Pemex oil. Mexican Riviera,  & DACAs could return & rebuild a nation. Plus I hear they already have a tough southern border. Mexico could be a profitable Puerto Rico.
2868 2018-01-22 18:25:01 wow i just learned that coconut oil is not healthy for your diet
2869 2018-01-22 18:25:01 Our new lunch menu has arrived! Our new appetizer of Tempura Zucchini Blossoms, ricotta, soyrizo, garlic confit, cilantro, avocado mousse, corn puree and chili oil is delish!
2870 2018-01-22 18:24:50 U are absolutely right, dems are so hateful, anything to try and upset Prez Trump, but he takes it all in stride, nose to the grindstone, he will still celebrate
2871 2018-01-22 18:24:48 @wyomingtourism The state of wyo destroyed the breeding of my horses and lab dogs for a profit of c.m.t videos and the undue strees killed my mother over the greed of oil,and if you look at c.m.t videos better man them our my horses this is your state of wyo corruption Nazi crook
2872 2018-01-22 18:24:10 IMF estimates we subsidize big oil to the tune of $10 MILLION per MINUTE. If we did that for clean energy, we could switch in no time.
2873 2018-01-22 18:24:09 Every crash we had so far? Volumes of research are available to you. Before worker's rights in this Country (which are eroding). Child labor? Exploitation of workers & environments around the World? Open pit oil fires by oil companies? Hired violence against villagers?
2874 2018-01-22 18:23:59 Normally coconut oil but sometimes I switch it up & use tea tree oil. 
2875 2018-01-22 18:23:52 That photographer needs to team up with that person in Spain who “fixed” that oil painting.
2876 2018-01-22 18:23:52 Females don't never check their oil. They just put gas in the car and drive.
2877 2018-01-22 18:23:47 Google says mild dish soap - something alkaline I guess. I'd try that and then shampoo to make sure there's no nasty chemicals left on his skin. It also says vegetable oil and peanut butter, but if I tried that my boys would eat it!
2878 2018-01-22 18:23:44 aw these men are talking to me like I’m a fragile little girl lol just change my oil jeffrey thank you
2879 2018-01-22 18:23:44 É preciso ter concorrência, um mercado aberto e de qualidade para não ficarmos reféns isso aí @vagas_oil_gas

2885 2018-01-22 18:23:17 Finally!!! Alexis is Red. Sit down blue Oil team. What a Statement signing by Manchester United . #Alexis #MUFC
2886 2018-01-22 18:23:04 If millions of people in more than 100 nations for than 100 years keep going to the same service providers and sending their friends and family it should count for something. Nobody is buying snake oil 100 years later, but there are more Chiropractors than ever.
2887 2018-01-22 18:22:54 If I was off that oil I woulda did that shit lmao

2891 2018-01-22 18:21:51 What did the oil money dry up? :)
2892 2018-01-22 18:21:42 Syria/Libya/Iraq/Iran restore and boost oil production and refining capacity to expand your market share ASAP.
2893 2018-01-22 18:21:41 One I stopped using coconut oil on my hair and started shampooing my hair more often instead of this co-wash bullshit my hair is growing again.
2894 2018-01-22 18:21:26 Emphasis on the peak itself & when it might occur was misleading IMO. The observation was that tightening supply of cheap, conventional oil would lead to pursuing increasingly more expensive, lower quality supply, i.e. unconventional oil.
2895 2018-01-22 18:21:11 For emergency (heading to work or bed) leave in hair & scalp protection, I've been getting good results from Now Foods Avocado oil. It's a thicker oil so it coats wet & dry hair but my coworkers think I just used mousse
2896 2018-01-22 18:21:08 only if they had big bazongas and were covered in oil
2897 2018-01-22 18:20:57 I let my hair soak in tea tree oil last night so hopefully it works how I wanted to 
2898 2018-01-22 18:20:46 Does that mean we can cut off all petroleum products from NYC? Gas, heating oil, diesel, ECT? Will they vote to turn off electricity?
2899 2018-01-22 18:20:38 @Jenna_Marbles you guys should take the dumb occupation cards you took out of Snake Oil and make them celebrities, then you have to try to sell or buy as that celebrity while doing impressions of them

2903 2018-01-22 18:20:18 In front of the press, Louie Gohmert tries to persuade Rick Perry that Russian oil executives are pretty adorable. Trump's body double goes commando.

2915 2018-01-22 18:18:35 .You can  also make a scrub by mixing one  teaspoon of granulated  sugar, one  teaspoon of honey, and one-half  teaspoon of almond oil. Use  it to scrub  your lips once a week.

So, your head is far up in the clouds, you think we love killing. Far from
2920 2018-01-22 18:18:19 For the nausea and vomiting inhale peppermint oil or drink mint tea. For the pain apparently chanca piedra works well. Most people use water and lemon juice but it isn't going to do a TON of good but it helps a little in the meantime.

2927 2018-01-22 18:17:45 @JoeManchinWV, @SenatorCollins (On @OutnumberedFNC)... Yeah. Blah, blah, blah! That snake oil merchant, @chuckschumer, stands and blatantly blows smoke, hoping few listening know the facts of how Govt. actually works. His agenda, clearly, is to undermine Pres Trump at every turn.
2928 2018-01-22 18:17:05 I started using avocado oil to take my makeup off & my face has cleared up so much
2929 2018-01-22 18:17:00 Damn, umm I suggest those oil diffuser ( Eucalyptus is great), or as simple as it sounds a bubble bath. Sometimes it's the little things. I hope you feel better :/
2930 2018-01-22 18:17:00 Or maybe, since Neil Young knows so much about AB oil and indigenous people, you could have him talk about indigenous rights in California, yes?
2931 2018-01-22 18:16:48 Maybe he can offer classes to teach oil painting?
2932 2018-01-22 18:16:35 Welcome @Alexis_Sanchez to the greatest #MUFC football club on the planet. Make number 7 proud!
2933 2018-01-22 18:16:25 Olive oil is such a fake b****
2934 2018-01-22 18:16:18 GOT OIL!!
2935 2018-01-22 18:16:13 Next time yall get an oil change, take your own oil and filter. I just saved like $35
2936 2018-01-22 18:16:12 I mean technically I’m due for the oil change after the last one I still haven’t gotten and my car still runs!! I ain’t no mechanic but you might not even ever need an oil change ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

2939 2018-01-22 18:15:54 All of that oil that I put on my scalp just dripping down my ears & neck. 
2940 2018-01-22 18:15:50 Apply a few drops of extra virgin olive oil on your lips and massage it gently.  Do this daily before going to bed.Alternatively, mix one-half teaspoon  of  sugar and a few drops of extra virgin olive oil. Scrub your lips  gently  with this mixture once a week.
2941 2018-01-22 18:15:36 Olive oil can also be used to make your  lips lively and vibrant. Olive oil contains many essential nutrients to  nurture your lips and its moisturizing property will make them soft and  beautiful.
2942 2018-01-22 18:15:33 Venezuela-Oust @NicolasMaduro ASAP. Elect conservatives to assembly & executive offices. Restore Constitutional rights. Rip up Chavez era oil pacts. Institute free market economic reforms. If done, I'll personal advise until progress is restored. What say you?
2943 2018-01-22 18:15:25 It's like watching the #WhiteHouse corral @realDonaldTrump week after week.  ... First it was 'gawddamn it, drill it all'; then it was 'but not at my bud @FLGovScott's beach'; then it was 'oh, @SecretaryZinke don't know shit'. #fracktheearth #oceans #oil #biodiversity
2944 2018-01-22 18:15:23 Other than enriching himself, his only other interest is helping his supporters (coal, oil, NRA) to enrich themselves. Everything else just bores him.
2945 2018-01-22 18:15:15 Sirji Manmohan Ji ki bhi growth figures were because of oil valuations
2946 2018-01-22 18:15:00 marijuana stores or how they ignore the monopoly of gas stations controlled by the oil corporation's.Where is their diversity now.
2947 2018-01-22 18:14:57 My generator has drank about 6 bottles of engine oil in 2 weeks. Gen guy has come to fix it, taken money and gone. I'm still with the problem. So basically gen and NEPA are messed up at the same time
2948 2018-01-22 18:14:44 The Free Cash Flow graph suggests that US tight oil may in fact be a Ponzi scheme.
2949 2018-01-22 18:14:39 oh wow me too i was thinkng about it actually i think bc of the dude talking about hot oil in soup
2950 2018-01-22 18:14:35 They do it when they're not even talking about people. I've heard someone whisper blaaaaack Castor Oil  :(
2951 2018-01-22 18:14:34 well this makes sense now I’ve literally been using coconut oil for everything and been wondering why i haven’t been getting certain results.
2952 2018-01-22 18:14:33 RT @AbelandCole: Draw out the natural sweetness of parsnips by slow roasting
Scrub or peel the 'snips
Cut into chunks
Warm a splash of oil…
2953 2018-01-22 18:14:21 rosehip oil! it's completely replaced moisturizers for me and makes my skin really soft and even. my whole routine is wash with cetaphil and use the oil and maybe once a week do an activated charcoal mask.

2956 2018-01-22 18:14:09 hahahahhaha actually me. the amount of times i have to tell ppl to stop using coconut oil on their face
2957 2018-01-22 18:13:55 Truth be told, I dont think anyone knows how far this bull will go. He hasn't paused to rest and thus the public worry. Maybe post budget, maybe a big oil spike (but there's #shale), maybe a bold loose money wind up move (but which central bank will bite the bullet)
2958 2018-01-22 18:13:54 When are we going to stop the coconut oil hype?
2959 2018-01-22 18:13:45 I have super dry sensitive skin, and for some reason my skin's favorite thing is just pure coconut oil rubbed into my face at night before I sleep. It never makes me break out!
2960 2018-01-22 18:13:27 Craving cow tongue with sesame oil and salt. It is way too early for that.
2961 2018-01-22 18:13:10 "The craziest and grooviest things in the world cannot be pursued or even fondled - they must be kissed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
2962 2018-01-22 18:13:09 I have CRAZY sensitive skin, and I don't spend a bundle - I love Origins Checks and Balances cleanser, the MILDEST makeup wipes I can find on sale at TJ Maxx (even Burt's Bees burns my skin), Clinique moisturizer in the yellow tube, Peter Thomas Roth masks, and coconut oil!
2963 2018-01-22 18:13:08 My tip is take 2-3 of the things you drink/eat the most of and switch to organic versions. A month later add another 2-3 things... Its hard to do it all at once ya know. But oil pulling #1 IMO. I mean I still eat pizza, poptarts, cookies... Just organic. :) Wishing you the best!

2986 2018-01-22 18:10:44 coconut oil is still beneficial to your skin after using an antibacterial face wash.. who would put coconut oil on a dirty face? 
2987 2018-01-22 18:10:27 Someone on this train has applied  so much olbas oil that my nose has unblocked at 10ft away.

3015 2018-01-22 18:06:53 coconut oil should NEVER be used on your face, unless you prefer clogged pores.
3016 2018-01-22 18:06:50 Why do we go to war in the first place? The world needs oil and people will pay for it. In a currency. Trump banning transactions in dollars is a phyric victory. Not even sure it is a victory!

3065 2018-01-22 18:02:32 Yea this is definitely true but I like the idea of cooking without oil but also not having your food watered down like when you boil it.
3066 2018-01-22 18:02:26 You forget the bottle of cooking oil.
3067 2018-01-22 18:02:21 He's dug a hole so deepI'm surprised he hasn't found oil yet.
3068 2018-01-22 18:02:18 Micellar water is amazing! I started using it after @AllDolledUp_SA recommended it. Use the oil infused one now as I like the added moisture, and the plain pink one makes my eyes sting if I'm over zealous with it. It's great stuff!
3069 2018-01-22 18:02:18 do people actually put coconut oil on their faces still? I’m breaking out thibking about it

3072 2018-01-22 18:02:11 How dare they not sell the US oil on the cheap and on their terms. How dare they try to better their country? What's next they'll invade Venezuela like Vietnam Korea Iraq Syria?
3073 2018-01-22 18:02:11 When obama destroyed Libya, because Libya wanted to sell their oil, with their own currency, did that make obama a sub-human that you refused to respect?

3087 2018-01-22 18:00:29 Omg, STOP. Yes, listen to her, but also listen to everyone’s experience. Your mileage may vary. Your experience with coconut oil =/= universal
3088 2018-01-22 18:00:27 The lowest emitters or those who don’t fall under the scheme. That’s the challenge. If your oil is except it’s like you have no emission.

3109 2018-01-22 17:57:35 It will be anyone who is prepared to finance them. Russia and China are battling for global supremacy so more than happy to start the move away from Petro Dollars. Oil Traders had started to pay out in Euros.
3110 2018-01-22 17:57:28 OPEC and Russia reaffirmed their intention to maintain oil production cuts for the rest of this year, while signaling their readiness to continue to cooperate into 2019.
3111 2018-01-22 17:57:27 Talk me through your Gulf oil sponsorship and your Saudi oil partnership

3116 2018-01-22 17:55:30 Saudi Arabia is one of the main reasons for Arab feuds. KSA is Trump’s favorite play thing for money and oil. KSA sold out religion and humanity for money. Trust me people are leaving KSA more than ever lately
3117 2018-01-22 17:55:23 Ugh that was so pointless, 111 told me to go to a walk-in centre well over 40 minutes walk away, to be told there's nothing they can do, and just put olive oil on it for two weeks
3118 2018-01-22 17:55:20 They don't want public input. More snake oil dealings.
3119 2018-01-22 17:55:19 Like coconut water? Or you just lather up with oil then rinse off?
3120 2018-01-22 17:55:08 Well, the tap is knackered, & it'd take 3 trips to the shop to mend it, but I've a better idea. I'll do as if it was an oil well: put an open valve on it, shut it off, & wait for a proper plumber!
3121 2018-01-22 17:54:56 And the Secretary of Interior should not be a shill for oil, gas and timber interest more more interested in destroying nature than preserving it for posterity.
3122 2018-01-22 17:54:37 Hold them to it,  per gop snake oil salesman
3123 2018-01-22 17:54:35 i be running out of lipgloss and go to using vaseline, oil, anything lmao i can’t.
3124 2018-01-22 17:54:32 Venezuela didn’t start by saying “We are going to turn into Venezuela.”  They started with an ideal of redistributing “excess” oil revenues... And now .... they are Venezuela
3125 2018-01-22 17:54:23 That's the right attitude. I was in a cubicle finance job before I left to become self employed. I almost felt like I had to justify my college degree by having a "real job"

People look at me confused when they find out I have two masters but change oil for a living!
3126 2018-01-22 17:54:20 Burning the midnight oil before the match starts at 4am but....... i forgot i’ve got a football match tmr 
3127 2018-01-22 17:53:52 You didn’t need the #sarcasm, I caught that you were being facetious. More than just Flint has shitty water, and it’s not because of the oil companies. Start blaming local gov for not fixing it and big gov for not stepping in when little gov fails.

3134 2018-01-22 17:53:14 and ole instead of oil but who cares 
3135 2018-01-22 17:53:13 Thanks for that. A lot of those have more to do with petroleum jelly, which is the carrier for the eucalyptus oil in Vicks, but very interesting read.

3143 2018-01-22 17:51:54 going to the junkyard to lay on oil and coolant saturated sand clay dirt, oozing of sharp metal and rusty car parts has never sounded worse than it does at this exact moment.

fuxk it tho, not everything in life is easy.

3153 2018-01-22 17:50:20 @American_Heart AHA is willing to cling 2 old data for the sake of saving its own face rather than telling the truth about the benefits of coconut oil. very sad. politicizing peoples' health.
3154 2018-01-22 17:50:17 Fossil fuel is not the future.  I saw what the BP spill did to the Gulf.  It is not pretty.  They can't control pipelines for leaking and they can't do it with oil rigs either.  Continue solar and wind power.

3164 2018-01-22 17:48:30 One last point: oil is not a CO2 Low hanging fruit. Efficiency, land use, deforestation and coal* power are all way cheaper reduction targets and make up >50% global emissions.

Preferably before we turn the over to the oil guys....
3173 2018-01-22 17:46:51 Surely to goodness the writing’s on the wall. Ten foot fluorescent letters - with spotlights shining on them - for all to see and read. We are being sold snake oil by amateurs and quacks. #WakeUpEngland
3174 2018-01-22 17:46:39 Interesting to note in the net income chart how the 4Q15 shows lower net income than 1Q16 even when the oil price during 1Q16 was miserable low.

I like these charts - pretty cool

3182 2018-01-22 17:45:23 I’d def say that works for clarifying / deep cleaning then I’d  go in after with a HEAVY oil or moisturizer to give you that glow back!  Or If u have any moisturizing sheet masks, you can always do that after the clay mask, then apply an oil on top! So extra, but necessary! 
3183 2018-01-22 17:45:21 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.

3200 2018-01-22 17:43:45 @chefsymon  Chef, along with the olive oil, is there a Mediterranean Diet cookbook you can recommend? Thanks again!!
3201 2018-01-22 17:43:42 Oil is sold globally. Put the price on gas locally but not oil production. All that does is push our oil back down in supply costs on global markets. It won’t change global oil demand.
3202 2018-01-22 17:43:35 Do you have any of these oils at home?
Olive oil
Avocado oil
Sesame oil (not toasted)
Jojoba oil
Almond oil
Refined Cocoa Butter
Ultra Refined Shea Butter
3203 2018-01-22 17:43:23 You ride the bus and don’t need oil. That’s the reason you’ve got bed bugs.

3205 2018-01-22 17:42:57 Why every time you get your car serviced they try to add on more stuff  like no bitch I just  need an oil change THASSS IT 
3206 2018-01-22 17:42:56 Just to clarify, George Monbiot is stating here, that the actions of big Republican Party donors - the Koch brothers, and Exxon Mobil oil (ex CEO is Trump's Sec. of State), in degrading the environment, are both examples of Neoliberalism at work.
3207 2018-01-22 17:42:42 @MsVeracruzXXX Movtivaded Monday...what two things  are you going to accomplish today..me..do laundry and get an oil change... 
3208 2018-01-22 17:42:38 Fair enough points. However at a 1 mln market cap will not take much to make it move hey big. A new oil asset and could 're rate very fast....IF of course. Risk rewards etc...

3215 2018-01-22 17:41:41 The thought of my parents even being consensually sexual makes me want to eat room temperature sardines washed down with castor oil, just so I can dramatically projectile vomit for effect.  If you know anyone looking for volunteers for that study, I'm in.

3219 2018-01-22 17:40:44 Why would democrats give oil industry toadie errr pathological lying racist political hack the benefit of the doubt on a vote? Don’t do it! Remember when he promised a vote on Judge Garland? He’s a morally corrupt hack. Let the GOP use the nuclear option!

3233 2018-01-22 17:38:56 Hi Rich, thanks for your feedback. We use margarine in our protein bites so our vegan grazers, and those who aren't able to eat dairy can enjoy them. I can also assure you that we only ever use RSPO 100% sustainable palm oil in our snacks :)
3234 2018-01-22 17:38:46 Long term projects, profitable at current oil price, aren’t going anywhere, even w/ intro of carbon price. There’s 2MT of emissions coming from NL’s Offshore - entire point of a carbon tax is to encourage a shift to alternative fuels, this is exactly what we need to be targeting
3235 2018-01-22 17:38:42 (2/2) hey raised the oil prices when they found out my body was being attacked on the steps of the church on sunset n alexandria
3236 2018-01-22 17:38:37 “The technical developments of almost every form of wealth [e.g., oil, minerals] are the forebears of Big Business; and Big Business, directly or indirectly, is the immediate cause of War.”

3237 2018-01-22 17:38:21 GS: comments over the weekend from Saudi and Russia were #oil  supportive, although ultimately nothing new: progress was being made, but with global inventories still above their target of 5yr average, they hoped that compliance to the deal would remain high.

3245 2018-01-22 17:36:35 Bro I remember one time this girl was trying to give me skincare advice for my very acne prone skin and she literally said "just take some coconut oil and pour it all over your face" ......... I never wanted to slap someone so bad before
3246 2018-01-22 17:36:19 @Audi 5 weeks wait to get an oil change is an absurd!! Great brand, I love my A3 but with this level of #CustomerService you are about to loose a customer. Thank God is not a break down... #audidayton #audiservice
3247 2018-01-22 17:36:15 It was really difficult to get used to bc at first it felt oily/ gross. A huge help is to wear your hair in a french braid most days, stays less oily. Also days I just braid it damp and don’t use a hair dryer I notice less oil production.

3251 2018-01-22 17:35:35 I feel like America has been running with the “check engine” light on for a long time and now everyone is wondering why nothing is working even though we didn’t go to the mechanic or get it serviced or even change the god damned oil.
3252 2018-01-22 17:35:35 Other than beard oil being 'essential' (get it?).
3253 2018-01-22 17:35:33 Can u use olive oil for dry scalp and skin??

3263 2018-01-22 17:34:24 Tillerson is an oil man. Trump's a conman. It goes deeper. Whoever is behind the use of terrorism as a means to destabilise Syria and overthrow their government is in the shadows. Think tanks, think think-tanks.
3264 2018-01-22 17:34:20 We can only apply CO2 costs to domestic oil if all foreign oil is also charged cause offshore Well-to-Wheel in NL is really low by global standards.
3265 2018-01-22 17:34:19 & then tack on gas, oil changes, insurance, student loan payments, food & anything fun i might want to do  i’m proud of myself for makin it work with no roommates but i’m always scrapin’

3269 2018-01-22 17:33:53 Crazy! Well deserved though. Fun team to watch. Lots of players having career bests... like the Oil last season :( Hooe the success is sustained... unlike the Oil.
3270 2018-01-22 17:33:53 You may be correct. But Dulcie, his skin is soooo soft. Oh my goodness! We slather him with coconut oil weekly.
3271 2018-01-22 17:33:50 The issue is being blamed on illegal immigration and DACA but it's really about having 3 short term spending bills in one fiscal years. No commitment. The GOP is trying to weaken the USD and raises Oil prices.
3272 2018-01-22 17:33:49 We have what they need.That’s the main reason behind the stop to the manufacturing of oil consuming cars.They want to be self sufficient and stop being dependent on oil producing nations.What is Nigeria planning toward this development when there would be no demand for our oil?
3273 2018-01-22 17:33:44 Good, bold move, oil companies are obliged to reduce prices now.
3274 2018-01-22 17:33:36 You forgot to mention Halliburton or Big Oil!!!   Don’t forget the script!!!!
3275 2018-01-22 17:33:26 Took my car for an oil change and ended up with a $350 bill I love adulting

3288 2018-01-22 17:31:47 Try cannabis oil for cancer patients
3289 2018-01-22 17:31:41 So Let's blow up people in the middle East including, women and children (and then breed more terrorism..)
They hate us and they are evil but we started this shit for the pursuit of oil and wealth.

Trump wants to murder children in north Korea by nuking the country, same thing.

3298 2018-01-22 17:30:40 One of those (usually blue) oil based makeup removers. Best to find one without alcohol in it. They're often marketed as 'eye makeup remover' but will take everything off easily :)
3299 2018-01-22 17:30:37 Vegan lasagna but it’s so much oil coming out of it , lmaooo how healthy is it
3300 2018-01-22 17:30:30 Oil oscillated toggled between gains and losses as Saudi Arabia and Russia signaled that their historic production caps may be extended into next year if a global supply glut persists.

3302 2018-01-22 17:30:26 Got it figured out, but because THEY did something stupid, on my day off I now have to go to the treasury department in person on top of needing to get my oil changed.
3303 2018-01-22 17:30:09 how refined is the oil tho?
3304 2018-01-22 17:30:08 Corrupt regimes, money laundering, milk mafia, water mafia, worst health & education, police mafia, terrorism, kidnapping for ransom, extortion, media mafia, molvi mafia, milavat mafia, oil mafia, tanker mafia, Indian/Israeli/US agents...whats else you need despite having nukes
3305 2018-01-22 17:30:08 ok what’s the absolute latest I can wait to get my oil changed? Don’t say anything under 5k miles because that ship has sailed
3306 2018-01-22 17:30:07 Might as well put car oil on them if you using that

3308 2018-01-22 17:29:57 I'd say currently I find Wet and Messy (WAM) very interesting. Being covered in various substances like slime, oil, mud, or foodstuffs can be a very colorful and delicious kink.
3309 2018-01-22 17:29:51 Next time you dye it mix the bleach with coconut oil. The bleach does it job but it also isn't as harsh to your hair as it normally would be
3310 2018-01-22 17:29:41 :D and yes, like the other comment, rinse it out after using then dry and put salt in it. Scrub it with a paper towel and all the food bits should come off. Put a little oil in, rub it and heat until it smokes a bit. Turn off. All good.
3311 2018-01-22 17:29:40 Vitamin e oil, castor oil, and jojoba are all good for your skin and hair too!!
3312 2018-01-22 17:29:31 Yes I agree, but also take into account the price per barrel of oil today and 2004.
3313 2018-01-22 17:29:30 I wouldn't use castor oil as an all-over moisturiser, but everything else would work. 
3314 2018-01-22 17:29:29 Finally! After suffering from congestion in my Eustachian Tubes for years it looks like I'll be able to clear them with a facial sauna and Olbas oil. Some way to go but I can feel a difference already. No more light headedness 
3315 2018-01-22 17:29:27 I put some conditioner in my hair to wash out today but brady really loves coconut oil and this smells like coconuts, so I keep waking up with him licking my head
3316 2018-01-22 17:29:21 I am all for more transparent working practises, but if you're frying hot dogs, ferrorocha samosa, and fries all in the same oil.... we no longer friends.

3319 2018-01-22 17:29:06 add Fish oil to diet, the get some coconut oil to apply to hands. Plenty of fluids that do not contain caffeine. PS this weather does not help.
3320 2018-01-22 17:29:00 This is a word salad. The only thing it misses is olive oil.
3321 2018-01-22 17:28:56 I'm big on aromatherapy! I always have a plug-in, incense, candle or oil burning in my house at all times
3322 2018-01-22 17:28:29 Not scared of Russia. .we have no oil
3323 2018-01-22 17:28:23 My pasta at the dining hall today was more like soup and not pasta and I’m like 99% sure all the oil in this Alfredo sauce will make me sick.
3324 2018-01-22 17:28:22 When you get out a new roll of toilet paper, place a few drops of your favorite essential oil in the cardboard tube of the toilet paper.
3325 2018-01-22 17:28:20 Got myself some coconut oil I’m so excited
3326 2018-01-22 17:28:19 with that being said, argon or jojoba oil are a lot better to use on your skin bc it’s way lower on the comedogenic scale and have a lot more omega 6 and 9 fatty acids x
3327 2018-01-22 17:28:18 Back then in uni after closing book on all those crappy lectures #AwonTemi in the hostel go don finish preparing the life of concotion with palm oil.... woss Agat zero problem

3334 2018-01-22 17:26:27 Other thing not accounted is trillions US spent over quarter century of military intervention in MidEast, all debt. One thing for sure is there is no more cheap oil and the global economy remains completely reliant on cheap oil, now subsidized by cheap money.
3335 2018-01-22 17:26:26 Brent crude oil rose $0.21/bl today to $68.79/bl, after Russian and Saudi Arabian Energy Ministers suggested extending current OPEC production cuts beyond 2018

3347 2018-01-22 17:24:56 Is coconut oil good for skin or bad for skin? I’m so so confused every article online says it’s good for your skin? Can i have a source please?
3348 2018-01-22 17:24:56 icooked up some fresh beef tortellini pasta, with some lemon juice, olive oil and fresh dill, and its perfect. i love pasta
3349 2018-01-22 17:24:51 sis... you gotta realize that not everybody’s skin is the same. What works/doesnt work for you doesnt mean it will be the same for someone else. Coconut oil is the only reason my skin stays clear lol

3358 2018-01-22 17:23:53 why do people want to pay some much more for oil to make others rich DT
3359 2018-01-22 17:23:21 With Brent Crude touching $70 a barrel, it is worth the UK stepping up its drilling for shale oil & gas. Proven reserves are vast & accessible with none of the terrors predicted by the anti-fracking wreckers. Start drilling!
3360 2018-01-22 17:23:19 Ha-ha! When you are concentrated on Russian oil deals mostly - that happens.
3361 2018-01-22 17:23:15 Coconut oil miracle lotion. Found it at Walmart and you can use it on your face too.
3362 2018-01-22 17:23:14 i wonder who traded the oil for the uk re the Al Yamamah arms deals
3363 2018-01-22 17:23:07 Shit! I put coconut oil on my hand after it had been severely cut up in the car accident. It has not only kept the skin moisturized but has helped heal the cuts fast and reduce the scarring. I know which I believe.
3364 2018-01-22 17:23:00 Hi there!
I have no idea who it was but I imagine they might have told you about our Damaged Hot Oil Treatment! It is brilliant for bringing damaged hair back from the brink!
I hope this helps! :) - Josh
3365 2018-01-22 17:22:59 Let’s keep deregulating these guys so they can run unsafe oil rigs.
3366 2018-01-22 17:22:58 Either I knew and forgot, or didn’t know Smytty was involved with the Oil.
3367 2018-01-22 17:22:47 Does Walmart sell avocado oil?
3368 2018-01-22 17:22:47 all true. But it's alarming the racism out in the open seems to be spreading like an oil stain all over the world. It will take much humility and open-mindedness to move forward.
3369 2018-01-22 17:22:42 make sure to pick up some beard oil in case it starts to get itchy
3370 2018-01-22 17:22:38 Is that why coconut oil was terrible for my hair? I have very dry hair and scalp.
3371 2018-01-22 17:22:32 I fully expect to see a Tyrone oil painting in King’s Chapel
3372 2018-01-22 17:22:30 yes, while coconut oil and olive oil are naturally comedogenic, it CAN clog your pores. it doesn’t mean it’s gonna happen to everybody. it depends on your skin type and how your skin reacts to it.

3377 2018-01-22 17:21:47 Coconut oil is the devil as far as I'm concerned. 
While using it it made my scalp itch like crazy! Rashes that looked like burns all over my body.
I stopped using it immediately 
3378 2018-01-22 17:21:46 I recently switched out of ALL oil company funds & tobacco (which I didn't know I was even in). I don't want MY money supporting these companies and more than it needs to.

3380 2018-01-22 17:21:36 lrt oh god coconut oil made my skin break out SO BAD when i first tried it...never again
3381 2018-01-22 17:21:36 Our value system is not the same with Fulani's, there is no way we can coexist as one people, is like oil and water. They need to be on their own so that they can produce the next Osama Bin laden.
3382 2018-01-22 17:21:34 Ooh. Maybe it's because I don't like mine cooked in water, I put butter, oil & sugar same time & close to steam. Then ligcadeke
3383 2018-01-22 17:21:30 The expression and opinion layed out on this editorial, is by far meaning less, waste of ink and printing. The revenue adjustment to oil price influences many things. Nevertheless, accountability is essential, and while there are truth to both side. It is not a solution.
3384 2018-01-22 17:21:29 No prob. You right about the coconut oil too lol
3385 2018-01-22 17:21:25 I’ve been seeing a lot of tweets about bacteria harbors in Coconut oil and that’s nothing but facts. I used to put it on my skin and I remember one time I put my hand into my jar and it turned my fingers black....couldn’t believe it. Coconut oil dutty
3386 2018-01-22 17:21:22 theres only four other people in oil studio this semester... cool
3387 2018-01-22 17:21:06 With oil and euro holding i don t see a catalyst. Shutdown didn t move the thing up so why down ?

3392 2018-01-22 17:20:11 Note to self, buy bone oil for quieter skeleton joints
3393 2018-01-22 17:19:44 The cetaphil oil control with spf 30 is great if your looking for a sunscreen combo

3395 2018-01-22 17:18:46 Look for seabuckthorn oil! It works wonders for me and I have seborrheic dermatitis which is essentiallly eczema for your scalp. For your actual hair avocado and sweet almond oil work well or continue with seabuckthorn. Keep the other oils lower on your hair/ away from your scalp
3396 2018-01-22 17:18:38 Do you know who held the rights to oil exploration around the malvinas and any truth in it being connected to Mr thatcher?

3403 2018-01-22 17:18:04 @KristenxLeanne I saw your snap about putting oil in your hair and I recommend amla oil, it thickens and strengths your hair as well as helping it grow and it’s so good, I’ve been using it and my hair has grown double what it usually does in a month 
3404 2018-01-22 17:17:58 Left the pipe in the car and my dad took it to get an oil change I swear if he throws it away lol
3405 2018-01-22 17:17:54 Thanks - see that is the only oil painting you have of the poet so perhaps that influenced your choice - a little unfortunate you blamed the sitter for what others at the time thought to be a poor resemblance?
3406 2018-01-22 17:17:50 My coworkers are passive aggressively arguing about coconut oil. Can’t make this up

Told today have to have oil change NOW cos car built Dec2015. £200+
None of this explained at time of purchase - but happy to get PCP signed. 
Seems shoddy to me.
Car’s done 10k miles. 

3409 2018-01-22 17:16:37 Cannot believe @vauxhall #pentagon let me drive away in a dangerous car but were really busy trying to sell me oil when I already have a spare in the car!
3410 2018-01-22 17:16:23 Does anyone know where I can buy a dipstick. Mine doesn't reach the oil anymore. — ￼looking for recommendations.
3411 2018-01-22 17:16:17 Perfect, that will send the greens over the edge but how will they get their product to China? I thought they were opposed to increased tanker traffic or does that just apply to Alberta oil?
3412 2018-01-22 17:16:15 .... and now oil turns flat again.... hmm
3413 2018-01-22 17:16:11 can’t believe people really use coconut oil to moisturize dry skin, use marula or squalane instead lmao
3414 2018-01-22 17:16:05 I think it's high time we started a twitter movement to #endfuelcrisis . I lend my voice to say #notoartificialscarcity. It is high time oil marketers told us why there's hoarding.@Gidi_Traffic @lamidegiwa @Omojuwa @DJJABTICS @fbilash @Realomosexy

3422 2018-01-22 17:15:19 The fact you are saying America isn't great already is a serious problem. If you don't like your country, then leave. Also, whats the deal with trying to ruin the environment? Our future generations will not care about the oil...
3423 2018-01-22 17:15:08 A decade and half ago, I coined the term "oil yoke." Oil price up, economy down, price down, economy up, oil up... Two years $50 and global economy doing best since a $100, no accident. Still not accounted shale's massive debt subsidization.
3424 2018-01-22 17:15:07 youre probably alright using it the way you do & if its not affecting your skin negatively keep using it, but if you have acne/break outs maybe stop using the coconut oil and see if it improves
3425 2018-01-22 17:15:01 This coconut oil is getting my beard right

Which does allow you to annoy environmentally minded friends by saying your car runs on oil derived from plants.

3468 2018-01-22 17:10:08 Sumuka ka tapos maglagay ka ng efficascent oil tapos inom ka warm water.
3469 2018-01-22 17:10:07 Oh I'll agree it is mismanagement and corruption but it has little to do with socialism. Norway for instance is a socialist state heavily dependent on oil but they took steps to not fall for the resource curse.
3470 2018-01-22 17:10:03 I use honey and just started using almond oil to wash my face, and any actual cleanser I use is a natural brand. It's made a huge difference.
3471 2018-01-22 17:10:00 Let me explain this simply. If you think austerity dogma is necessary under any circumstances then you've swallowed the Tory snake oil and you're doing their bidding without even realising it.
3472 2018-01-22 17:09:58 I’m still daddy’s girl. He took my car to get an oil change and it’s also time for me to get the inspection for it but he calls me this morning and he’s like “well since I already have your car I might as well get the inspection done too”  I love my dad.
3473 2018-01-22 17:09:51 That boy tin-man gay always got his homies to oil him up
3474 2018-01-22 17:09:30 Yes. Weak dollar and $60 oil is cure for global economy.

3475 2018-01-22 17:09:27 Poor Dave’s busy enjoying his nice warm office . Oil all ordered, should be here Wednesday... just 48 hours of brrrr to go!
3476 2018-01-22 17:09:15 coloured oil on water ?
3477 2018-01-22 17:09:08 I agree @RealMattCouch. 

It can be daunting to separate  fact from fiction. I have a litmus test, that I use, but still have been burned s few times.  So much crap or there.  

By helping to illuminate the questionable material, perhaps you can help the less savvy?

3479 2018-01-22 17:08:51 I quite like Nelson Fraser. It makes you sound like an oil baron.
3480 2018-01-22 17:08:49 I do! But never happened before :( get better soon! Are you putting too much oil?
3481 2018-01-22 17:08:42 como que no ? quieren un dólar a 36 o 40 y el gas oil a 31 y sacar ayudas sociales...y ganar mas ellos y que a el resto lo parta un rayo...
3482 2018-01-22 17:08:30 Climate is always changing. To name a hypothesis after a known fact (Climate changes) Should set alarm bells off to any reasonable human being. I tell you to look at it through the scientific method and you tell me to look at it through what supposedly oil co. Know. Mind reader.
3483 2018-01-22 17:08:21 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
3484 2018-01-22 17:08:20 nah been through this section a couple of times by now and yep rn I'm using a mix of walnut oil and walnut galkyd for safety reasons and it's been an adjustment but so far it's not bad.  And by this point I've noticed I'm barely using any medium at all
3485 2018-01-22 17:08:10 Mood :  an oil rub down
3486 2018-01-22 17:08:09 OK Elemental Defenders... trees, clear cutting, animal habitat loss, palm oil industry, mahogany industry, fruit tree farms... lets get a focus and lets bend it like Beckham.
3487 2018-01-22 17:08:05 went and got my oil changed by myself today, so I guess that's enough adulting for the week.

3490 2018-01-22 17:07:43 I don’t know about y’all but as far as my skin goes coconut oil been working for my clear skin so lol y’all can argue with them people
3491 2018-01-22 17:07:41 Being an adult & getting an oil change is depressing. 
3492 2018-01-22 17:07:34 I'm learning so much about the NFL while waiting for my oil change. Key takeaways:
-The Bears' top draft priority should be an All-Pro left tackle.
-Andy Dalton is really inconsistent.

3501 2018-01-22 17:06:45 tip: don’t ever drive through any amount of water even if it’s less than an inch bc you will take your car in for an oil change and end up paying $400 bc you fucked up the underneath of your car
3502 2018-01-22 17:06:44 Get your snake oil off the NHS. If your treatment cannot be distinguished from the placebo affect then it has no right to be publicly funded. It is a joke and offensive to the people who need genuine medicine that the NHS will not fund
3503 2018-01-22 17:06:35 I’ve been trying to get an oil change since Thursday and when my dad sends me I forget my card and license

3512 2018-01-22 17:05:00 Maybe its actually a good thing! High prices would force governments to explore alternative sources of energy and reduce their dependence on fossil fuels! In the long term, prices are not inelastic! For eg., oil shocks of 1970s forced companies to produce fuel efficient cars!
3513 2018-01-22 17:04:51 So they now want to fight because of coconut oil, nonsense! Will you not use it and see for yourself if you don’t believe what is being said about it? As for me and my household coconut oil is banned!
3514 2018-01-22 17:04:48 Ilove the way you pronounce some words like oul(oil) conciler(concealer) etc  love you

3532 2018-01-22 17:02:55 I bought tanning oil once for indoor salon use and the drugstore cashier was like “wow you going somewhere sunny?” & im so awk that i deadass just like giggled & didnt say anything & shes like “.... well wherever it is i hope its fun” & i rlly think about this like once a week
3533 2018-01-22 17:02:39 While others groan, you will grow & like Asher dip ur feet in oil for grace & prosperity. Ur feet shall be as iron to crush Satan's head
3534 2018-01-22 17:02:17 This is misleading. It looks like that oil price has reverted back to 2005 in 2017, however it does not consider change in currency value of other currencies against USD.

3541 2018-01-22 17:01:33 TIPS; If you want to fry something and doesn’t want the oil to splatter, simply add a pinch of salt when you’re heating up the oil to reduce oil splatter.
3542 2018-01-22 17:01:26 Just had a sandwich with chicken, bacon, avocado, lettuce, ranch, bit of basil and pinch of olive oil. I am fighting so hard not to go get another one. :-(

3546 2018-01-22 17:00:53 Here's a tip: Check your oil level every other time you fill up. The engine will be warm, and you'll remember to give it regular attention!
3547 2018-01-22 17:00:50 I guess Floridians are giving up there cars then? I mean it’s ok to get oil from anywhere else and they don’t care what that drilling might do. So there going to all ride bikes or horses, right?! Just as inane as protesters driving cars to protest pipeline.
3548 2018-01-22 17:00:30 The Disgraceful Iraqi Kurds! Unlike the Kurds of Iran and turkey, Iraqi Kurds enjoy an autonomous status supported by 17% of Iraqi budget.

3571 2018-01-22 16:58:04 Also #BeardedMen stop using coconut oil on your beards for daytime wear. Your beard isn't absorbing it. It's just sitting on top of the beard hairs in glistening beads. Try jojoba, grapeseed, or avocado oils.
3572 2018-01-22 16:58:01 Norway is great!  They have a "ton" of crude oil and despite that they run almost 100% on renewable energy!

3626 2018-01-22 16:51:25 Nope. That is incorrect. Factory farmers are HEAVILY subsidized in the US and the UK. The meat lobby here has more power than oil! There are a lot of efforts and campaigns to push back but due to subsidy even the decreased demand they still produce at the same rate
3627 2018-01-22 16:51:25 People are getting too heated about coconut oil: It's works for some, it doesn't work for others. Fucking chill.

3652 2018-01-22 16:48:28 These short term spending bills are only designed to cause more public strife. Designed to lower the value of the USD and raise oil prices. Haven't you seen the pattern? #Tyler #TeamTyler

3658 2018-01-22 16:47:44 In US, every product category is now below 5 year average from days of supply viewpoint including crude. Falih and Nowak want the absolute inventory down. This is a recipe for well over $80 oil.
3659 2018-01-22 16:47:41 WHO PUTS COCUNUT OIL DIRECTLY ON THEIR FACE???
3660 2018-01-22 16:47:31 tbh coconut oil really does help some ppls skin...if it didn’t help you doesn’t mean it doesn’t help others
3661 2018-01-22 16:47:24 True, you should write an article about the reasons oil can hit $100 and maybe which real assets are good for an inflationary environment? Except real estate. Keep it up @tdichristopher
3662 2018-01-22 16:47:23 I used to use coconut oil on my face and then randomly switched to Rosehip oil because I didn’t like how coconut oil made my face feel and wowowowow I noticed the changes in my skin immediately. 

It wasnt till recently that I learned why coconut oil is bad for your face.

Good/bad economics?

3748 2018-01-22 16:35:37 @tvcnewsng #JH I think we should allow other sole proprietorship in the movement of oil

3750 2018-01-22 16:35:18 In the morning when I wake I have a smell to me that’s a bit like gun metal, or an oil you might use on stainless steel. I think it’s from my age. This odd odor came about in my early 60’s. After I shower I don’t smell it but each morning it’s there. Odd. Input welcome...

3763 2018-01-22 16:33:56 Thats exactly the point im trying to make. But I think that crudes point is hinged on Libyan fatigue from conflict and chaos of last 7 years. Meaning no matter the pay off, the psychological factor of maintaining oil  income at this price is enough to stabilise production
3764 2018-01-22 16:33:48 Russia Brazil primarily Oil economy.... And Italy is bankrupt.... It's like India being stagnant and others de promoted...

3767 2018-01-22 16:33:06 This is awesome! Thank you for sharing. The media should definitely be covering this as clean energy is the future, hell we'd probably have more of it now if big oil/ electric(Koch's) didn't own so many politicians.
3768 2018-01-22 16:33:05 In 5+ years of owning it I've found minor engine 'quirks' are best ignored. Like its habit of suddenly drinking oil for no reason and then no more for 18 months. "Normal" apparently.
3769 2018-01-22 16:32:57 The Oil. If we split, there would be no Nigeria and their dependence on our oil would be affected. The white don’t care about Africans as long as their own people are doing fine. Nigerians are the set of people who milk themselves because of profit.
3770 2018-01-22 16:32:53 if it weren't for this migraine I'd be going to get my car's oil changed

3780 2018-01-22 16:31:24 @RaceKawasaki you guys ever plan to release any off-road spec'd bikes? Maybe even a 2-stroke? Hate to leave the brand but the old kx450f is like an oil tanker in the tight woods.
3781 2018-01-22 16:31:18 Energy security the UK is becoming heavily dependent on natural gas just as North Sea running out. 

The US  generates 25% of electicity from coal this can act as a buffer for future shocks in the oil and gas market.

US & UK should not become totally dependent on shale gas

3792 2018-01-22 16:30:07 Yes. I know many who use the essential oils. It works for them & no doubt the oils overall have good benefits. It’s the ANNOYING sellers that get me. This one mother was asking prayer for her baby as they headed to ER. Croup worse. Oil seller asked her to try oils first.
3793 2018-01-22 16:30:00 US private equity firm Carlyle is to raise a $2.5bn fund to buy oil and gas assets outside North America
3794 2018-01-22 16:29:59 Plastic comes from oil, oil is a natural component of #earth. Plastic can also be reverted back into oil now, as well as being recycled to be reused - they can use recycled plastic for 3D printing - seek solutions, not problems.
3795 2018-01-22 16:29:58 Oil and powder cant stop us !!!!
3796 2018-01-22 16:29:54 There is talk of a Venezuela bust. When the state oil company follows, China and Russia as major creditors will get a hand on the worlds largest oil-reserves for the price of a few billion dollars, no bad deal. Read "The art of the deal" probably.
3797 2018-01-22 16:29:41 Absolutely.
3798 2018-01-22 16:29:36 What about creating a budget that gave money to conduct research into the oil industry that helped American oil companies find new ways of fracking oil, methods that would release the US from international trade orgs like OPEC and save the average American millions?
3799 2018-01-22 16:29:32 It's a perfect reference. Mine is covered in oil stains :D
3800 2018-01-22 16:29:27 It's killing growth. If oil goes higher, there won't be a recovery.
3801 2018-01-22 16:28:40 Meanwhile, Petrol & Diesel prices in Maharashtra state are highest in the country (80₹ avg) still nobody is talking about it. I'm not so optimistic on inclusion of oil products in GSG either. This is the area where every state earns huge revenue, they'll not let it go easily!
3802 2018-01-22 16:28:38 I remember when I used to take the trolley I couldn’t wait until I bought my car. Now I have a car you have to worry about tags, smog check, oil change etc

3838 2018-01-22 16:24:21 Hate to tell you but Iraqis killed Iraqis. They did it because they wanted to control the patronage networks. Would have been nice if they wanted democracy, but they didn't. Also, 500K is small potatoes compared to 100s of millions raised from poverty via oil powered trade.

3881 2018-01-22 16:18:56 That Campbell and Laherrere paper from 1998 looks pretty good now, I admit. But you are right: If that is the argument, then talking about it as Peak Oil is needlessly misleading

3888 2018-01-22 16:18:30 Is there a really good psychological study out there regarding the reluctancy on admitting being conned?  Fox News, Bernie Madoff, etc. I have smart friends who believe the snake oil being sold to them.  I wonder if there’s a human bias preventing them from admitting the con.
3889 2018-01-22 16:18:29 It is relatively easy to get an immediate effect when you take total control of a petro-economy during huge oil price boom. Proof of system comes in sustaining it.

3899 2018-01-22 16:17:47 did something happen in oil or..?
3900 2018-01-22 16:17:46 Done and tried; aloe vera gel, petroleum jelly, tea tree oil, cold presses...
3901 2018-01-22 16:17:31 Try doing it once a week. With heat. That used to help my hair ALOT. Also, oils are your best friend. Tea tree or Olive oil on your scalp before bed every night with a satin cap. Have to be consistent though.
3902 2018-01-22 16:17:27 Holy Crude Oil!
3903 2018-01-22 16:17:23 It isn’t just about identity politics. It’s about things like making sure the water isn’t poison, cars don’t fall apart on impact, and the tourist industry isn’t ruined by oil companies. Deregulation hurts the people.

3936 2018-01-22 16:12:48 As recently as 2011 petroleum market experts predicted $300/bbl oil by 2020. In 2008 they predicted $300 by 2015. Back in 2003 they didn't know US tight would save our bacon 2012-present. GW was talking hydrogen economy. Iraq war was energy security.

3943 2018-01-22 16:11:35 Yeah I'm sure it's taxes as to why people leave there countries of origin. God that statement just stinks of privilege and affluence. I'm sure it's regulations as to why Brazil's economy is crap. Nothing to do with a country soley relying on oil to export.

3965 2018-01-22 16:09:58 If we have the oil resources to become self sufficient, I think we should do just that and refrain from export sales. The savings over ride the profit. Heaven forbid that we would "run out" of crude and be forced to go to importing crude again. Your thoughts? @Varneyco

4014 2018-01-22 16:05:03 skincare advice: if i use coconut oil with relatively no problems (i dont have superr acne prone skin, few breakouts w hormones) what type of oil should i switch to? my skin is normal-oily sometimes

4025 2018-01-22 16:04:21 Perhaps because the grand canyon was cut by a river, and ice ages end for reasons that don't explain recent rapid temperature rises? I had thought people weren't gullible enough to be still tricked by oil company propaganda today.

4066 2018-01-22 16:01:37 this should not be a surprise to me, but the best product for cultivating my malayali curls is a lil bit of coconut oil
4067 2018-01-22 16:01:33 I love coconut oil and I swear by it but if you really want your dry face to be great use jojoba oil. It’s closer to our natural face oils. And is way lighter than coconut oil if you don’t use too much.

4074 2018-01-22 16:00:46 Well nuclear is fine. And there's actually some real progress being made even when it comes to fusion. That would be a complete game changer. Also there's massive investment in the solar and batteries for instance, even by the oil companies. It's not just the government.

4099 2018-01-22 15:58:05 yall i have a serious question regarding oil cleansing method like do you wipe your face dry from any oil first and only then you cleanse it with oil or you dont need to wipe your face and let the oil on your face mix with your cleansing oil?
4100 2018-01-22 15:57:54 Girllll why so much hate on coconut oil ? Coconut oil is a dry type of  oil it’s not like rubbing vegetable oil on your face , it helps a lot with acne scars too. 10/10
4101 2018-01-22 15:57:46 Clutching at straws.  Palm oil is not specifically "vegan" and neither are any of the others.  If you think by products means support, then the dairy industry is the biggest supporter of palm oil with palm kernels (PKE) a major feed additive.

4114 2018-01-22 15:56:47 Sure, but will they do this with positive carry from backwardated curve?  If oil climb above 65 - I think so. Now? Who knows.
4115 2018-01-22 15:56:46 King and truth...kind of like oil water, they just don't mix.
4116 2018-01-22 15:56:35 The end is near for utility companies.  Solar and wind are too efficient.  No pollution -no dependency on foreign sources like oil.  Storage is dropping in price too. Taxes for social programs paid from income taxes, federal taxes.

4122 2018-01-22 15:55:59 OPEC/non-OPEC coalition eyes continued oil market management beyond 2018

Far from breaking up, OPEC and its allies said Sunday they will look to prolong their partnership even after their production cuts have rebalanced the oil market.
4123 2018-01-22 15:55:58 Sounds like another move to place propaganda in schools, as Big Oil has been doing for decades. Nuclear energy has never been, nor will it ever be, a safe and sensible option. #RenewableEnergy is the only smart path forward.

4131 2018-01-22 15:55:01 You make a very fair point Matt.  I think we should eliminate ALL corporate subsidies and corporate tax loopholes.  Oil, Ethanol, green energy...all of it.  I think substantially lowering corporate tax rate was necessary first step in eliminating corp welfare.

Few drops of Eucaplyptus Oil in humidifier next to bed at night also soothing and healing

4157 2018-01-22 15:52:13 there’s no oil or gas in my house for heating/cooking (all hydro) + if there was, that wouldn’t disqualify my right to speak out.
4158 2018-01-22 15:52:03 Definitely drink the oil

4160 2018-01-22 15:51:33 I think jr should have had everything the ranch ewing oil but everybody left him so he had nobody to share it with then he realised the error of hes ways
4161 2018-01-22 15:51:20 You should use an oil based cleanser first for 30 sec to one min then a regular cleanser for 30 sec to one min! Dermatologica has a good double cleansing kit but if you want cheaper, no 7 cleansing oil and CereVe hydrating cleanser.
4162 2018-01-22 15:51:18 Nah almond oil really the best thing to ever happen to my follicles

4165 2018-01-22 15:51:08 @ArvindKejriwal @msisodia Release LS 2019 Manifesto with Petrol & Diesel Price half. This is enough to win 2019 LS election. Manifesto title "Jo kaha wahi kiya" . Srilanka price is 50, nepal price is 50. Both buy oil from india.
4166 2018-01-22 15:51:08 All these countries are the same..they got blessed with oil, then enriched themselves and built up their country on the slave labor of Asian workers. All corrupt with a wealthy elite who are hypocrites in every sense. Unimpressed.
4167 2018-01-22 15:51:00 S/O to Jason for teaching me how to change my tire and my oil. He's the real MVP in this situation
4168 2018-01-22 15:50:58 which hazel & coconut oil is the truth.
4169 2018-01-22 15:50:57 I have oily skin too but I use the rose hip seed oil from The Ordinary and it does wonders! I know it's scary to put more oil on an oily skin but it helps regulate how much oil my face produces

4220 2018-01-22 15:44:00 This has nothing to do with nothing other than market speculation. Oil prices may hit a $100 or $30! On the upside there's investment in renewable energy is growing.

4223 2018-01-22 15:43:41 I agree but then force disincentives for abuse. Regulate deforestation and GHG emissions. What about palm oil supplies where this is not a problem? Countries where palm oil is important for their economy should be allowed to fix the problem. #bioenergy #biofuels #bioeconomy

4247 2018-01-22 15:41:20 It doesn't produce as much of its own so it's basically reducing it. Oily people are dry that's why their skin produces so much oil. Weird but that's what I learned lol. Apply a serum at night before bed it helps a lot. Your skin takes about 2 weeks to adapt to new products then

4261 2018-01-22 15:40:07 Avocado oil is so much better than coconut oil
4262 2018-01-22 15:39:54 Coconut oil is the worst but if your skin is oily it's actually good to put an oil on your face. Do it at night tho. When you add a serum or oil of some sort it helps combat your natural oils. Your skin is producing so much of its own that when you introduce something else

4264 2018-01-22 15:39:37 There's also gasoline shortages, in the country with the biggest oil deposits. Gas is produced in the country and PDVSA is owned by the government, isn't it? Now, whose fault is that? It worked perfectly before socialism. Probably US Imperialism... Or is it capitalism? Or the CIA
4265 2018-01-22 15:39:35 I'll give you something bigger than a conspiracy theory. How about more oil and gas than daisy and Qatar combined with

4293 2018-01-22 15:37:01 I would say: leave oil alone. It is the premier transportation fuel. IMO the priorities would be to replace first biomass and then coal.
So yes, natural gas and nuclear are excellent alternatives right now.

4299 2018-01-22 15:36:07 They say they bring in more money then they funnel out lol then why is US money going to Mexico brings in more money then Mexico's oil?

4303 2018-01-22 15:35:54 RINs are purchased because the blending product is not available.  Oil refiners and blending facilities are forced to purchase RINs in lieu of product that is impossible to deliver.

4441 2018-01-22 15:21:30 Oil at least has uses as a chemical feed. Continued use of coal for anything other than maybe metal processing is a pointless and dirty waste of money.
4442 2018-01-22 15:21:29 Russians conditions of support were clear : border control in Afrin and Omar oil fields for Assad .Kurds rejected it so they can't expect support from Russia.

Scottish National Party unearthed the report thirty years afterwards.

4446 2018-01-22 15:21:18 This whole mess is far too complicated for me to opine on, other than much of the conflict in the region is largely influenced by @BP_plc and their iron grip on world leaders in oil rich regions.

4489 2018-01-22 15:17:47 I love when people say “such and such brand oil or pills really has great results”. Um if y’all left the heat out of your hair and moisturized it the way your supposed to, you would see results without spending 30 dollars for 1ml of oil.

4496 2018-01-22 15:16:41 Yes sir. I get your point. But something that worked in one place might not work in another. Societal constraints are different. Plus Dubai can take hit on their collection. After all UAE has put of oil money. We don't and can't keep on exempting things.

4510 2018-01-22 15:15:53 The oil industry was state and private own. In 2010 Chavez in live television expropiated every aspect of the industry, kicking out every international company.

4516 2018-01-22 15:15:34 News of further Western firms writing off losses in Venezuela oil industry raises corollary question of how badly are .ve networks penetrated, & which intrusion sets may have had prior knowledge? But is this already priced into risk of doing business in a failed socialist state?
4517 2018-01-22 15:15:29 I see. The real problem is that you think Cali is arrogant. North Dakota is doing well NOW because of the oil boom but it’s still a farm state. Also, they have a population of less than a million people - far easier to manage.

4539 2018-01-22 15:13:05 Well, I'm beginning to doubt your word now. Oil has been nationalised since 1976. There has never been intensive agriculture in Ven because of the discovery of oil.
4540 2018-01-22 15:12:57 It's a pretty direct problem, in the sense that a climate policy that encourages palm oil use necessarily creates incentives for palm expansion, which leads to deforestation, peat loss and higher carbon emissions than just using diesel, and so the policy fails to deliver.

4580 2018-01-22 15:09:33 Petrol price in Mumbai touches Rs 80 per litre first time since August 2014, on back of higher crude oil prices!

4593 2018-01-22 15:08:25 You know when you’re frying some hash browns but it gets too burnt and drenched in oil so you just kinda leave it on a plate to dry out before throwing it cause ya that’s what my head feels like now an inedible greasy piece of burnt potato

4599 2018-01-22 15:08:01 This is the research, when you have a proven 100% pure essential oil to put on your cats/dogs and do it properly there is no danger to the animals. You can't go buying oils at your local store, those are the ones that will hurt not only your animals but you too.
4600 2018-01-22 15:07:54 But it is light years better than it was.  No one was going to invest in downtown OKC or relocate here until it decided to clean up it's act from the 70's I.M. Pei plan disaster and the last 2 Oil Busts
4601 2018-01-22 15:07:45 Putting it in your hair is great either. I know that one will piss people off but it's true. I worked in a salon and I can tell you, coconut oil does penetrate the hair, and it STAYS there. When you blow dry it, straighten it, whatever, it SMOKES. In no way, is that good.
4602 2018-01-22 15:07:42 I took a shot of coconut oil today. I almost died.

4608 2018-01-22 15:07:11 What about the hidden oil fields
4609 2018-01-22 15:07:02 For example oils like olive oil, coconut oil, and avocado oil are able to penetrate your hair shaft allowing moisture in. Sealant oils like jojoba oil and grapeseed oil aren’t able to penetrate your hair shaft all they do is seal the moisture in.

4614 2018-01-22 15:06:43 China chartered a foreign ship to transport and supply oil to North Korea to avoid violating UN sanctions against the country. The country is very clever. Recently, Japan's B3C aircraft took a picture of a Dominican ship that sold oil to a North Korean ship in the East Sea
4615 2018-01-22 15:06:37 I use tenderflake, and put the pans in the oven for at least 10 minutes to heat up the oil. Fill them a little over halfway.

4626 2018-01-22 15:05:39 Yes, exactly. Oil is a bad fuel. Even the oil company recognizes that and is working to change their status as an oil company. Plastic is exactly what we should be using oil for. Burning such a valuable chemical is a huge waste.

4720 2018-01-22 14:55:38 Moisturize those lips! Lips dry out faster as they have fewer oil glands. Apply lip balm with sunscreen. Keep them moist and sun protected.
4721 2018-01-22 14:55:29 Coconut oil is anti bacterial.
4722 2018-01-22 14:55:05 They want to remain slaves, when pmb has displayed so much bias against the SE,SS wia bulk of oil revenue comes from
4723 2018-01-22 14:55:04 OTB Cask: @StewartBrewing - Ricochet Pale 4.2%, @HarviestounBrew - Old Engine Oil 4.5%, @BrassCastleBeer - Black Forest 6%.

4725 2018-01-22 14:55:00 I need to go get my oil changed.
4726 2018-01-22 14:54:59 @narendramodi oil price is shooting.are you aware this?
4727 2018-01-22 14:54:59 Fried in Scotland's Oil. I hope.
4728 2018-01-22 14:54:59 Charming oil of boat. Salcombe. £75
4729 2018-01-22 14:54:42 Wow I really shoulda just changed my oil this is redic
4730 2018-01-22 14:54:39 Is that brake fluid or motor oil they're serving up now? 
4731 2018-01-22 14:54:33 Coconut oil doesn’t work for everybody. Stop lying and saying it does.
4732 2018-01-22 14:54:07 Cort, as a major RV supporter and a tortured Oilers fan, please do not associate my hockey team with the complete chop shop blog that is CoH, newspaper association aside. For good Oil content, please see @TheAthleticEDM, among others.
4733 2018-01-22 14:53:50 go sell the oil and pay your debt, and you and your sons live on the rest.
4734 2018-01-22 14:53:46 Never seen so many scrambled excuses of why Sanchez chose United from the media and bitter rivals. Wages gone from £250k to £600k a week. Though no one bats an eyelid at Yaya sitting on the bench for £250k of oil money a week...the agenda is so apparent 
4735 2018-01-22 14:53:44 Eucalyptus oil  smelling It and putting it on my wrists would help a lot
4736 2018-01-22 14:53:43 Remember the oil for food program for a Iraqthe UN was skimming money off the top of it under the auspices of helping the people of Iraq that's really bad press I haven't forgot
4737 2018-01-22 14:53:42 That moment when you’re asleep and wake up because you feel like your sweating bad but in reality it’s your grandma pouring the whole bottle of oil anointing and praying for you  couldn’t even go back to sleep because it was smelling like a healing service.
4738 2018-01-22 14:53:35 You need to do double cleansing boys, oil cleansing for first step, rinse and then facial wash #lrt
4739 2018-01-22 14:53:32 Oil on my white converse.... happy Monday
4740 2018-01-22 14:53:11 I really gotta make my own Chinese hot oil sauce now that I live in #Phoenix Yes the mom and pop Chinese take out restaurants have hot oil sauce but yeah it's not great like the hot oil sauce from the mom and pop take outs in #Chicago
4741 2018-01-22 14:53:10 Wow! Where did she buy that set from ?
4742 2018-01-22 14:53:05 Hope not so many millions die before you find out you're wrong. Take a look at Venezuela the second largest oil economy in the world. Now the murder capital of the world its people starving and millions fleeing to Colombia. The wonders of socialism.
4743 2018-01-22 14:53:03 Don't know how you guys burn the midnight oil night after night at the #AusOpen but those of us reading your tweets from 16 time zones away over breakfast appreciate your humor and great work you're doing! 
4744 2018-01-22 14:53:00 I applied rose oil to my hair last night and I woke up today looking like a greaser I don't know what I'm suppose to do now !!!
4745 2018-01-22 14:52:56 #idratherbeworking. At a car dealership getting my oil changed, instead of working like I’m supposed to be doing
4746 2018-01-22 14:52:51 finally remembered to buy that earth therapeutics anti stress oil  hu wants a massage ahahaha
4747 2018-01-22 14:52:50 This guy reminds me of a snake oil sakesman.
4748 2018-01-22 14:52:44 Oh girl I feel that! Winter is a killer for dry skin. It’s a brand called lipidol, it makes all kinds of oils for your skin. Oil wash, over night oil, even after shave and body oils. They are Super cheap too- you can get it at any drug store or Walmart.
4749 2018-01-22 14:52:34 Putin wants the oil in Iraq! Duh!
4750 2018-01-22 14:52:31 Actually, those "expensive" solutions will have huge returns and even the oil lobby is starting to recognize that. The way of the future is solar, wind,  hydro, fision, hopefully nuclear fusion...all much more sensible and cost-effective ways of energy production.
4751 2018-01-22 14:52:30 @IndianOilcl @dpradhanbjp sare nikamme indian oil me hi hai....na to call receive krte h..toll free pr aur na hi service reqest ka reply kr rhe 1 month se
4752 2018-01-22 14:52:25 Hahaha ga semua makanan diet itu ga enak. Ini cuma sayuran di oseng pake olive oil trus kasi thyme sama parsley udah no salt no papers no sugar. 
4753 2018-01-22 14:52:18 I think NO energy expert could have predicted 20 years back that the US was going to become the #1 oil/gas producer in 2018. And yet, it has happened.
4754 2018-01-22 14:52:08 @DUH_Im_TINK I soften it and whip it with some vitamin E oil and my face hasn’t failed me since (outside of shark week bc hormones )
4755 2018-01-22 14:51:59 雪の中お疲れ様です…
4756 2018-01-22 14:51:39 so now all of a sudden coconut oil isn’t good? y’all are so fickle.  shut up!
4757 2018-01-22 14:51:37 I hate that Panda Express don't have Chinese hot oil sauce.

4760 2018-01-22 14:50:55 Rub castor oil on your edges before you wake up tweeting & being bitter.
4761 2018-01-22 14:50:54 Oil change and new tires today 
4762 2018-01-22 14:50:50 Omg my oldest daughter’s hair drinks oil just like that. It’s so frustrating for me so I can only imagine what you’re going to deal with while gone. I’ll send you a care package with your fav products 
4763 2018-01-22 14:50:48 知ったかはどっちや笑
完璧圧勝ですね
4764 2018-01-22 14:50:30 Don't worry. @SecretaryPerry has a secret plan to make renewables pay a tax to coal and oil so that coal and oil can funnel money to his future campaign for president, and THAT'S THE DEFINITION OF RENEWABLES! #truthbomb
4765 2018-01-22 14:50:30 บ่นๆไปงั้นแหละ555555
4766 2018-01-22 14:50:29 Today I would be happy with semi productive perfect imperfection. But for right now... Oil change
4767 2018-01-22 14:50:27 It's nearly 11, and I'm craving a bucket of olive-oil-fried Korean chicken and some Cerveza Negra and a huge layer cake with buttercream frosting and bags and bags of chips.
4768 2018-01-22 14:50:24 P sure my blood is 34% olive oil
4769 2018-01-22 14:50:17 Just an observation. Government gives tax breaks to Americans, then gives the proceeds to oil companies in the way of higher gas prices. And if you think you're going to get tax breaks that are extended past 2020 elections, you are a dreamer as well!!!
4770 2018-01-22 14:50:14 His statement was only options in the event of oil dropping are borrow or raise taxes, which is false
4771 2018-01-22 14:50:11 castor oil baliw
4772 2018-01-22 14:50:11 ใช่ๆๆๆ ถูกๆๆๆๆ
4773 2018-01-22 14:50:07 And that's why I would only ever get a new one, tbh. Lease, too - so they throw in free oil changes for life and the like.
4774 2018-01-22 14:49:56 Try Coconut oil from @lucybeecoconut
4775 2018-01-22 14:49:38 FYI history: Henry Ford designed his original Model T to run on ethanol. Rockafellar from Standard Oil manages to pass a Constitutional admendment that prohibited any & all manufacturing/distribution of alcohol. What we were taught was a "Tempest" movement was a govt COWSPIRACY.
4776 2018-01-22 14:49:37 This depends upon analytics, be it oil or data.
4777 2018-01-22 14:49:28 Crude oil at three year high

4781 2018-01-22 14:49:05 when i started my hair journey i realized coconut oil wasn’t doing much but as soon as i switched to argan oil and black casted oil my curls started growing and flourishing quicker than ever
4782 2018-01-22 14:49:01 Hasn’t there’s been a recent snake oil discovery somewhere near you?
4783 2018-01-22 14:48:59 Eeh
4784 2018-01-22 14:48:57 Why everyone maxing about coconut oil?
4785 2018-01-22 14:48:50 First day of using rosehip oil. Let's see how it goes..
4786 2018-01-22 14:48:47 Mine is beginning to bother me because it’s getting longer and my natural color is this dusty ass brown. It always looks dry even when it’s dripping with oil. Kinda why I keep color in it.
4787 2018-01-22 14:48:38 I did: preheated over to 350, little olive oil, rosemary, salt, pepper, and a red zin.
4788 2018-01-22 14:48:07 Definitely seems like an inflationary surprise is not in the offing, right? And while oil prices have come back, there are few signs we're rocketing all the way back above $100 a barrel. This would have made a killer #ThrowbackThursday.
4789 2018-01-22 14:48:04 最近出張のときキャリーに服を直接放り込むようになってしまった。。
4790 2018-01-22 14:48:02 Wait until fuel oil is priced on the NSYE and is REALLY priced on supply and demand! Prices will drop to 60's pricing. 3rd world will be no more. Trump begins the roll out of his uncle's (Tesla's) tech. The world will never be the same. Type 2 Civilization in our lifetimes.

4793 2018-01-22 14:47:49 Sad that more of the nation didn’t jump in the #noDAPL pipeline to let oil and gas know we are serious about safety, environment. @StandingRockST
4794 2018-01-22 14:47:43 I have dry skin and I almost exclusively use oils as moisturizers. Due to the dry air, this time of year I don't even use lotion, just shea butter and an oil blend to moisturize my skin and my face.

4874 2018-01-22 14:38:47 Does "real" also mean less processed?
Canola oil is processed with hexane. So,  eating that will have a negative effect on your body.
Also other vegetable oils like corn are gmo and heavily processed. Ur probably better off eating less processed lard or butter.

4925 2018-01-22 14:31:19 Venezuela's entire economy is built on oil exports.  It does not have a dynamic, diversified, economy.  It's also not a sovereign currency issuer.  It pegs its currency and owes debts in a foreign currency, as did Weimar Germany

5008 2018-01-22 14:20:38 Yes but I think it’s the wrong oil. Seasame ?

5014 2018-01-22 14:19:51 Yes, you do. But after that unyielding headline, “The flawed climate gambit against big oil,” it seems more like a throwaway. And we know most folks don’t make it past the headline anyway! 
5015 2018-01-22 14:19:43 Oil Pulling isn't the nicest thing but it works! I had a mouth ulcer recently and putting coconut oil on it worked a treat for the pain and to heal it faster

5024 2018-01-22 14:19:15 Christ said that, not to be dismissive of the poor, but because His disciples had criticized a woman who offered Him expensive oil, rather than giving to the poor.

5032 2018-01-22 14:18:15 I was under the impression that coconut oil had antibacterial properties and that was why it was favored as one of the only good oil based lubes.

5047 2018-01-22 14:17:15 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.
5048 2018-01-22 14:17:11 Agreed! This is should be a political issue at all. I wish politicians in the USA would stand up & be truthful: “Climate change is real, but oil/gas/coal/mining companies fund me & I make money, sooo.”

5058 2018-01-22 14:14:44 Oil has been on its way out since it was discovered. Natural gas cars are cheaper to run, cleaner, and more powerful, while ethanol is cheaper, cleaner, and renewable.
5059 2018-01-22 14:14:42 Research institutes have been on strike for about 2months now. Of course you won't hear anything cos it's not connected to oil. Govt doesn't give a hoot.

5389 2018-01-22 13:30:05 Trump is doing two things that PUTIN loves. 1. he is threatening to stop Iran's oil output by starting sanctions, Russia depends on oil prices and 2. Trump is devaluing the US dollar. It's down a whopping 20% since Trump took office. Both will drive up the price of oil.

5391 2018-01-22 13:29:56 Oil is taxed to rebuild roads / infrastructure that uses the oil.  But I am sure some of it just goes to the general fund as well.  Solar / Wind are subsidized because the industry is young, changes to the 30% rebate- on the horizon as it becomes competitive w/electric utilities

5409 2018-01-22 13:27:36 Bullshit. What possible reason would Assad have to do that? The vast majority of Syrians support Assad & the government. It is now indisputable that the war was manufactured by 'outside interests' (think oil pipe-lines). I would question the source of that info - BIGLY.

5704 2018-01-22 12:46:58 @TwitterAPI hello there. Twitter is absolutely amazing and super fun to use but I have a suggestion. Everytime I search something, there is a slight lag and the search scroll fills up with 3 hastags related to my search and the real page I want to visit is now below the hastags.
5705 2018-01-22 12:46:49 If there spending power remains as solid then yes. City's owners..is there money in oil? Hmm..
5706 2018-01-22 12:46:43 And the list goes on. Gina we could stay here all day and list countless teams bigger than Oil city.
5707 2018-01-22 12:46:37 The point is - real "experts" don't refer to themselves as such! 

Have issues with "self proclaimed experts" peddling snake oil on Twitter
5708 2018-01-22 12:45:58 Never thought the engine would malfunction... maybe I shouldn’t have put in that olive oil.
5709 2018-01-22 12:45:58 They are all sold out now mate huge demand for the little amount that was available guess it shows how much demand there will be as if the drills are successful they could unlock a new oil producing super power 10 billion recoverable potentially in blocks V and IV alone
5710 2018-01-22 12:45:54 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my  cup runs over.
Psalm 23:5 #Word.
5711 2018-01-22 12:45:49 Suggestions: Skills should be Nature and Investigation, to reflect a modern HS science education.  Tools should be a gaming set that nobody knows how to use ("you see, hills produce sheep...") and alchemists' tools -- gunpowder, soap, alcohol, oil, acid: Connecticut Yankee stuff.

5714 2018-01-22 12:45:33 【add oil】

[慣用句](香港やその他中華英語圏)
1.頑張れ

同じ意味を持つ中国語の慣用句「加油(jia you)」からの借用語。直訳ですね。「油を加える」→「頑張れ」。

例 Add oil lor. I'll support you. 頑張れ。応援するよ。

6453 2018-01-22 10:56:22 Good to see @exportcenter_ru making long term commitments to Africa of a non-commodity nature. To date, their interest have mostly been in mining and oil & gas.

6454 2018-01-22 10:56:14 That's where you getting it wrong coz the price is high doesn't mean we do not have plenty of yam. For instance the fuel scarcity now, as that also show that we do not have enough crude oil. Nigeria is blessed but not with good and credible leadership.

6560 2018-01-22 10:34:41 1: That's on current generator methods, ignoring that we could change those.
2: More than the emissions to get the oil, transport it, refine it, transport it again, and finally it being used in the engine? I doubt that.

6877 2018-01-22 09:26:30 My personal recommendation for ANY skin would be LUSH's Angels on Bare Skin exfoliator - an almond, lavander and rose mixture, their full of grace cleanser bar - an olive oil and portobello mushroom mixture, mask of magnaminty - peppermint, aduki bean, kaolin and honey mix
6878 2018-01-22 09:26:28 I guess this varies per person because coconut oil actually helps my skin a lot and I have dry skin to the point of getting very dry patches (both body and face) if I don't use anything. It doesn't do much for my lips, though.
6879 2018-01-22 09:26:24 NNPC had in December 2017 hinted that Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF) price of PMS was $620 per metric tonne, and that at N305 to a dollar, PMS landing cost translated to N171 per litre. At that time, oil price traded below $65 per barrel.

7429 2018-01-22 07:37:43 Skincare tip: If you’re prone to blackheads and clogged pores, don’t use coconut oil as a moisturizer because it is a comedogenic oil (AKA will clog pores). I personally use hemp seed oil, which can be used on most if not all skin types!

7448 2018-01-22 07:34:26 There's some good info here, but coc. oil does impart some moisture. It's (4) on the comedogenic scale so not recommended for facial use, but every1's different. It has antibacterial properties that can help fight acne. Shea butter is non-comedogenic(0) & has many other benefits.

Hotels etc throw out a lot
But there are myths
eg Most grain is wasted or goes to livestock
Consider canola
45% is canola oil
55% is seed husks & pulp.
So most is waste or stockfeed
But would go to landfill if it wasn't

7547 2018-01-22 07:12:31 As ever though context is everything....not sure Conservatives should take credit for low inflation caused by falling oil prices . "There was persistent low inflation in FYE 2016, driven by a fall in oil prices". What is clear is the amount of poverty in UK.

7564 2018-01-22 07:09:23 When cars can use any fuel, different fuels will have to compete on the basis of energy, not some indirect factor such as the ratio of Diesel vs Gasoline in a barrel of oil.  When Diesel is high, then people will use gasoline, NG, Propane, H2 or whatever is cheaper.  No monopoly

7571 2018-01-22 07:07:37 Yeah! I've tried their eye cream, night serum, and night oil so far. Love the night serum, eye cream works pretty well, and not a fan of the oil. I'll let you know how this one turns out! They're expensive but I like them because they're cruelty free

But PGIB reforms should be monitored to engender transparency, while at the same time making the oil & gas sector more business-oriented & profit-drive & efficient!
7589 2018-01-22 07:04:13 @NTAGMN bill or no bill is not the issue, but integrity of all stakeholders in the downstream
The oil and gas sector need to be restructured holistically to curb persistent cause of fuel scarcity. Let us leave stories modular refinery is the solution.

7606 2018-01-22 07:01:17 @NTAGMN The next question is thrown open to all the panelists: 'Is it that we have no enough laws & regulations over the years to guide our oil sector that we are suffering this evil or is purely due to lack of political will & massive corruption in the sector'?

7622 2018-01-22 06:59:01 But nowhere in these articles has it stated that coconut oil doesn’t work on dry skin. Coconut oil is very YMMV but saying it doesn’t work for a fact is a stretch
7623 2018-01-22 06:58:41 Yes, you are right in some cases.What about the plastics, oil, fertilizers & chemicals that poison the oceans of the earth?

7628 2018-01-22 06:57:02 @NTAGMN The Petroleum Industry Governance Bill is only a tentative step towards reforming our oil & gas sector. The distortion in our oil and gas sector will only be fixed when NASS passes the rest of the bill.

7670 2018-01-22 06:50:09 No there's no theoretical need to burn only oil to get oil. My point was that unconventional oil is much more expensive (in energy) than what peaked in 2005 and that maybe the shale industry financials reflects this? #EROImatters

7694 2018-01-22 06:44:34 Everyone swears by coconut oil making your face and skin smooth so I started putting it on my faces and skin (I have no acne and clear smooth skin normally) and I have started breaking out and I have dry bumpy skin now

7988 2018-01-22 05:54:34 is that oil?
7989 2018-01-22 05:54:22 Go do some research.  Oil companies pay RINs which go to support ethanol which can’t be produced.  So if you kill oil.  You kill all the research and funding for “green” be careful what you wish for.

8011 2018-01-22 05:50:35 I'm already studying the contents in the modules. Presently, I'm just studying to broaden my knowledge about the operations associated with offshore drilling, as I have no need that this knowledge serves, since I'm not engaged with any oil firm and currently unemployed.
8012 2018-01-22 05:50:14 And I can’t stand grown fucking men that can’t get a real fucking job. Like deadass it’s not like any of y’all got shit better to do but be a bunch of fucking bums. Lazy fucks won’t work 12 hours a day or go out to the oil field and it blows my mind.
8013 2018-01-22 05:50:14 Thank you for your care. South American Christian Couries are all  in high financial difficulties.

8078 2018-01-22 05:38:55 Coconut oil is actually trash . A few years ago I listened to twitter and that shit did not prevent dry skin. It also dried my hair .
8079 2018-01-22 05:38:31 Shatter/wax - it’s a highly concentrated form of cannabis. Often made using butane to extract the oils from the plant matter, it’s sometimes referred to as BHO (butane hash oil), although that’s kind of an umbrella term.

8086 2018-01-22 05:37:54 Just be careful.  Olive oil has a low burn temperature.  Too much friction and you might have smoke.

8088 2018-01-22 05:37:14 Only use coconut oil to remove your makeup, it won’t dry out your skin but it is a fallacy that it acts as a moisturizer. Make sure to wash your face with an actual face wash or plain dove soap after removing the makeup. Use avocado oil to moisturize your face.

8090 2018-01-22 05:36:42 Dude, don't bullshit me. Just because you like Trump doesn't mean that peak oil hasn't already passed and that there won't be a permanent switch to renewables.

Data, once was a scarce resource because technology hadn't grown. Not, it's the opposite. 

We're all trying to master human attention, by using data.
8102 2018-01-22 05:34:56 With the earth’s population expected to grow by 2 billion people in the next 30 years, the demand for all forms of energy will be strong.  The oil sands will make a lot of money for Canadians if pipelines are built to ship oil to markets south and overseas.

i'm not sure that sounds like such a bad thing. I'm just saying. the way I'm seeing it, it's nearly as good as it gets!
8131 2018-01-22 05:29:31 This castor oil smell so bad but it help my hair grow
8132 2018-01-22 05:29:25 So Twitter just told me I should be using avocado oil and not coconut oil.
8133 2018-01-22 05:29:18 Jojoba Oil 
8134 2018-01-22 05:29:12 I use vitamin E oil. No complaints over here.
8135 2018-01-22 05:29:01 Nop. You said coconut oil smh
8136 2018-01-22 05:28:55 Ultimately, money. 

A combination of solar, wind, and tidal power could be a viable solution for breaking fossil fuel dependency.

Problem is lobbying interests in favor of coal, oil, natural gas, etc do not want investment in the technology and infrastructure to make it happen.
8137 2018-01-22 05:28:38 Freshly showered glazed with coconut oil like my name @IAMSAFAREE  
8138 2018-01-22 05:28:35 The United States has surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia and now produces more oil and natural gas than any other country in the world.
8139 2018-01-22 05:28:35 What about argon oil??
8140 2018-01-22 05:28:33 Kfb@shattu_koki
8141 2018-01-22 05:28:27 This is where I get my coconut oil
8142 2018-01-22 05:28:20 laying on a beach w tanning oil on and music playing would definitely solve all of my problems ugh
8143 2018-01-22 05:28:17 I said avocado oil 
8144 2018-01-22 05:27:50 Its factually correct. And so weird. Why do we hate Iran so much?? (Okay, they had an idiot president during Bush, but, hell. We had Bush...And now we have Trump..).
But I guess it’s all oil & proxy wars.
8145 2018-01-22 05:27:38 Using skin oil after the shower makes my skin feel like butter, it's so soft.
8146 2018-01-22 05:27:30 Spilled coconut oil in my bed 
8147 2018-01-22 05:27:03 Yea Middle Ages in Europe was a real party.
8148 2018-01-22 05:27:03 Kukuí oil shampoo & CONDITIONER for OGX. It’s in a black bottle
8149 2018-01-22 05:26:49 Thank you for answering my pointed question. I'll have to ignore your 2nd sentence because I did not ask that.

Crux: Data IS IN abundance.

Oil was IN abundance. (how much was it useful, cleaning needed etc. are peripheral).

Human attention is NOT available in abundance.
8150 2018-01-22 05:26:03 Lol
8151 2018-01-22 05:25:59 That old oil derrick covered in cement, plaster, styrofoam and plastic?  We love it too.    (And we named him Derek, in case you were curious)
8152 2018-01-22 05:25:41 Ab ap Kahn ho madam ji Congress  jab ke time mai thoda bhi oil ke rate badte the to sadak par a jati ab ap so Rahi ho kya
8153 2018-01-22 05:25:25 職場で一泊してもいいけど時給発生してほしい
8154 2018-01-22 05:25:06 It is a very symbolic that the biggest Oil producing country in wester Europe #Norway is going all electric in different modes of transport. This indicates that Oil Era is nearing its end and future looks very electric. I believe ships and airplanes will follow up in due course.
8155 2018-01-22 05:25:05 @Lewtoons @GaomonpentabletWould love to break into digital drawing, i've always done traditional art (oil, charcoal, graphite, watercolor) but have a tablet would open up a new vector for me
8156 2018-01-22 05:25:05 多分17時には本日の予定が完遂してるはずなので、それ以降ならいつでも行けるゾ
8157 2018-01-22 05:24:57 冷えまつくら始めました。
8158 2018-01-22 05:24:10 olive oil works! just make sure to clean your face after, it'll break down the makeup ^^
8159 2018-01-22 05:24:06 Thank you! Yeah I always like to change up some recipes. 1/2 c of oil on top sounds a bit excessive.
8160 2018-01-22 05:23:48 y’all think coconut oil is good for anything. 
8161 2018-01-22 05:23:34 The key to no stretch marks while pregnant is keeping for skin moisturized(drenched in oil) & staying hydrated . Pleeeeenty of water 
8162 2018-01-22 05:23:27 อยากช่วยค่าห้องแต่สี้นเดือน
8163 2018-01-22 05:23:25 Thank you. This is useful info. The oil and gas industry has been reluctant to embrace regulations on methane emissions due to the perceived cost of compliance, but those costs still need to be quantified. This study might give benefits against which the costs should be compared.
8164 2018-01-22 05:23:22 Dont worry in coming days crude oil gonna cross $100
8165 2018-01-22 05:23:05 I used to think my mama was crazy when she bought avocado oil for us to use on our face  my how times have changed
8166 2018-01-22 05:23:03 Covered in lavender oil >
8167 2018-01-22 05:23:02 I would rather support historic indian clubs like East bengal rather than oil funded club ruining football
8168 2018-01-22 05:23:02 Oil & gas from the Wild
8169 2018-01-22 05:23:01 Yes, I have many crafts I can make. Lend me your oil soaked cardboard goodness bruddah.
8170 2018-01-22 05:22:52 There is zero truth to what you believe. You know Obama was going for an Islam takeover for oil rich Muslim terrorists .Why on earth do  you think he brought muslims here instead the Christian's  muslims  are slaughtering  !?
8171 2018-01-22 05:22:41 I’ve melted coconut oil in the jar just sitting in the pan of boiling water
8172 2018-01-22 05:22:34 What a waste of cooking oil. Hopefully no pedestrian brushed against that & ruined a coat.
8173 2018-01-22 05:22:32 Anta maulana fansurna ya Allah
8174 2018-01-22 05:22:31 Drink plenty of water, sweet almond oil in 2-4 spritz, suave cocoa butter & shea, and tea tree oil. I use to use NYX honey dew me up in the summer time
8175 2018-01-22 05:22:27 @kibbe I am now adding coconut oil to my homemade smoothies
8176 2018-01-22 05:22:23 Castor Oil and Biotin has been orders. Aztec clay has been ordered as well. My spring break i will have a connected beard and clear skin
8177 2018-01-22 05:22:16 whatever foundation you choose, ALWAYS use translucent powder after primer and then BEFORE and AFTER putting on your liquid or cream foundation to absorb any excess oil! trust me, my face looks like i’ve dunked my head in crisco if i don’t do this in my routine!!
8178 2018-01-22 05:22:01 Truth & Kenyans are like oil &  water. Some people Know Why, Where, and Who murdered Musando. But instead of seeking justice for his family by presenting evidence to investigators, they wring every ounce of political gibberish from the sad event.
8179 2018-01-22 05:21:42 Field boundaries follow roads, drainage ditches, beaches, railways, valleys, acreages, sidings, 500kV power lines, oil roads, cliffs etc.  Filing by the quarter is a huge headache.
8180 2018-01-22 05:21:33 why he got body oil on?
8181 2018-01-22 05:21:28 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
8182 2018-01-22 05:21:19 Depends on your porosity, if you have high porosity it works like magic, if you have low porosity it would literally sit on your strands and look greasy, avocado Oil is better!
8183 2018-01-22 05:21:18 Also clove oil, lemondgrass oil and cinnamon oil also work. But cinnamon oil is RLY INTENSE SO CAUTION W IT
8184 2018-01-22 05:21:18 you have motor oil?
8185 2018-01-22 05:21:12 Well the abundance you are talking is also related to demand. In that case I will use Gold as analogy as we know more certainly that no new Gold sources are available though new oil fields are found. Also we can resuse Gold for long long time as we can data
8186 2018-01-22 05:20:54 Avocado oil. It's my fave. I bleach and dye my hair constantly, and it's one of two main ingredients in my diy hair mask for repair
8187 2018-01-22 05:20:48 So, bottomline - data is IN abundance, like oil once was.

Human attention is a very scarce natural resource, like oil is now.

What you do with data, how you do it, what you do to get attention, how you do it - all these are peripheral to my main statement.
8188 2018-01-22 05:20:28 would you recommend olive oil? ; w ; (cause that's all i have LMAO)
8189 2018-01-22 05:20:06 Thanks. Hemp oil was recommended by a bud,  it's not working.
8190 2018-01-22 05:19:55 Problem with that is Obama was President by the time we really learned of all that they were up to, and that was mostly because of a giant oil spill. Much of the worst of the Bush fuckups just totally screwed Obama's first term.
8191 2018-01-22 05:19:48 What yoy do is dilute some peppermint oil into a small spriter bottle full of water and mist the fuck out of your car. It repels bugs
8192 2018-01-22 05:19:37 "It’s Summer
The sun radiates my skin and my hair
It’s a period of freedom
I sink in water like burning iron in oil, releasing heat in smoke
I am alone, and that’s what I want
At least what I thought I wanted..."
8193 2018-01-22 05:19:31 馬油を英訳すると…うーむ(中の人の英語力の限界)
8194 2018-01-22 05:19:19 Coconut oil is thicker, avocado oil is not. Coconut literally feels like grease in your face.
8195 2018-01-22 05:19:09 Cut in half put on tray drizzle olive oil.and roast till bottom is all caramelised
8196 2018-01-22 05:19:02 (#^-^)ﾒﾗﾒﾗﾒﾗ…ﾒﾗ………
8197 2018-01-22 05:19:01 @TheRealButchG @TheRealRoosterM I’ve no desire to be on TV, but had several in Silicon Valley tell me I have an excellent app idea. Problem? Hubby works on oil rig. I’m stay home & raise our 4 kids. I’d need $100K to develop it. I’d love to talk to y’all.
8198 2018-01-22 05:18:32 Guruji FM and oil ministry sleeps JBS

8200 2018-01-22 05:17:54 To start the day a nice cup of cranberry green tea with some coconut oil 
8201 2018-01-22 05:17:43 Given technological advancement, such 'data' is now in abundance, like oil once was. Again, as I said before, you're talking about what and how of the data, not data's abundance per se.
8202 2018-01-22 05:17:42 I been saying coconut oil doesn’t do anything other than give ur hair some shine
8203 2018-01-22 05:17:01 Hello my baby
     Hello my honey
     Hello my oil soaked rag
     I’m gonna slash your tires
     Then set that bitch on fire
8204 2018-01-22 05:16:59 And for the record, I don’t use coconut oil lol
8205 2018-01-22 05:16:49 @JeffNonay A bit misleading. Ribeye can have 10g, salmon 0.8 but graphic uses sirloin & mackerel likely on purpose. Also, have to weigh known benefit of unsaturated vs possible neg impact of saturated. Olive oil for example has fats that are required & that lower cholesterol 1/2
8206 2018-01-22 05:16:39 It’s bad? Lol sorry I’m terrible I know nothing about oils except for peppermint and tea tree oil

8208 2018-01-22 05:15:54 lol i checked my oil before leaving my moms and it was like ok level wise but it was kinda dark  i keep forgetting
8209 2018-01-22 05:15:51 @ComicDaveSmith 
It's trespassing to invade air above or earth beneath real property. No cantilevered decks or slanty oil drills.

Damages are irrelevant (crime not tort). No harm? Still a foul.

But get this: If owner never objects to known trespass, CONSENT IS LEGALLY IMPLIED!
8210 2018-01-22 05:15:28 Very nice program organised by  indian oil Jammu Divisional office on Petroleum conservation. Nice job done pl keep it up
8211 2018-01-22 05:15:23 You need to get some Young Living Kid Scents Sleepyize! It's essential oil and it is great. We got a sample last week and I use it 2 nights and she went to sleep within 5 mins and slept all night. We are waiting for our full size to come in now.
8212 2018-01-22 05:15:19 Avacado Oil is really great especially for my hair.
8213 2018-01-22 05:15:05 Ang hilig nila magpa-order ng mang inasal dito sa office eh di naman worth it pag walang chicken oil :(
8214 2018-01-22 05:14:52 I mix it with raw honey and a drop of tea tree oil
8215 2018-01-22 05:14:30 Aah betul, rasanya bukan oil based
8216 2018-01-22 05:14:19 Coconut oil mixed with gas then burn him .
8217 2018-01-22 05:14:10 Every night I put coconut oil in my nigga hair brush it and put his durag on lol that’s my son
8218 2018-01-22 05:13:33 Today @Walmart I was shopping for car oil. When I picked up the oil there was a crack, oil spilled on my new pants. The manager told me to check the product before picking it up and to buy laundry pods to wash them. My pants are ruined and the @Walmart manager didn’t apologize

8224 2018-01-22 05:13:01 Fucked Up My Car Cause I Forgot To Get An Oil Change  Woooow
8225 2018-01-22 05:12:51 I was supposed to get a oil change 10,130 miles ago that’s bad huh

8233 2018-01-22 05:11:59 the answer is coconut oil. doesn’t matter what the question is.
8234 2018-01-22 05:11:42 All these reports are built on information from the companies that have been known to exaggerate their figures, similar to the OIL industry they are the "Lithium Cartel" they have to ensure dominance over the rest... I believe this news has effected the whole Lithium market.
8235 2018-01-22 05:11:41 time to have a glass of premium motor oil
8236 2018-01-22 05:11:39 Lathered my oil and cocoa butter all over  goodnight 
8237 2018-01-22 05:11:34 kyrie be using coconut oil.
It actually clogs your pores
8238 2018-01-22 05:11:19 Coconut oil is pretty rich in lauric acid, sooo it’s anti-viral/ anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory. Bacteria doesn’t thrive off of it.. 
You probably don’t want to use it on ya face if prone to acne but stfu with the whole “bacteria eats it”
8239 2018-01-22 05:11:14 好きでーす！！！！

Sugar. Lime. Olive oil/Castor oil for exfoliating scrub.

8246 2018-01-22 05:10:22 Truth (Cont.)
27. We should help Iraq invade Iran at the same time to seize the Gulf Coast areas populated by the Arabs in Iran, forming a United Secular Shia Iraqi State in the Gulf. This will make Shia Iraq Oil Strong.
THESE ARE MY 27 THESIS FOR TOTAL VICTORY WITH OUR ALLIES!
8247 2018-01-22 05:10:20 Parliament shd pass law regulating foreign firm investment in sectors like oil. 51% labour or capital shd be Ugandan. #PayUgandaBuildUganda
8248 2018-01-22 05:09:50 Data availability is like oil wealth. Digital India is aiming for data refineries rather than data well in future for India. Happy Saraswati Puja. May Goddess of knowledge make our country leaders on digitisation
8249 2018-01-22 05:09:41 Obviously a cigarette couldn’t call me down so fucking bud. Well all i have is oil but that’ll do
8250 2018-01-22 05:09:32 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
8251 2018-01-22 05:09:29 It has taken me so long to accept putting oil on my skin to stop it being oily
8252 2018-01-22 05:09:28 The Baba Yaga went to breakfast off in it burn; and when she poured oil on the loom, and ask you weaving, dear aunt, my dear?"
8253 2018-01-22 05:09:28 Why oh why did I pick oil painting as my ap concentration medium, do I hate myself that much?
8254 2018-01-22 05:08:51 やるかぁw
8255 2018-01-22 05:08:48 I am craving bamboo and chili oil that I had with @illathekilla, it is so good.
8256 2018-01-22 05:08:29 How often do you guys use oil in your hair? Daily? Weekly? Every other week? Once a month?
8257 2018-01-22 05:07:59 I was frying vegetables the other day, and oil was able to pop on my face. It left me a ugly little scar. #ohwell But I love getting hurt in the kitchen, Love. It’s weird I know. I love all the scars it leaves me too. Especially burns.
8258 2018-01-22 05:07:57 As long as newsy sound bites do not endanger the overall profits of the parent corporations they are allowed.  Drug, political & oil ads are payoffs, so news dept will not investigate misconduct.  90% of US media is owned by 5 corporations. Bring back the Fairness Doctrine.
8259 2018-01-22 05:07:25 いやぁぁぁぁああああああああ！！！！(降雪)
8260 2018-01-22 05:07:18 Olive oil, lemon, Parmesan, black pepper, mustard. You have yourself a bomb ass low calorie salad dressing.
8261 2018-01-22 05:07:14 Best meal plan -if anyone doesn't know where to start: Big bowl of Green Salads with 1 piece of grass fed meat and some coconut oil or ghee.
8262 2018-01-22 05:07:02 she was....not totally pleased with the idea of Garlic Oil but I stand by it and she had to admit it did not hurt anything.
8263 2018-01-22 05:06:59 "Cey kau boleh aa try part time oil & gas cuti ni" 

"Katne?" 

"Dapur" 

"Eee copy lawak orang"
8264 2018-01-22 05:06:55 HELLA coconut oil
8265 2018-01-22 05:06:51 Forgot i put castor oil on my lashes and i just rubbed them 
8266 2018-01-22 05:06:01 i didn't say it wasn't i'm just saying not to use coconut oil on it but okay
8267 2018-01-22 05:06:01 Purée the raw jalapeños, sour cream, mash (I used red potatoes) olive oil, salt, pinch pepper .... we also add garlic and cayenne chili oil
8268 2018-01-22 05:05:55 Well data is more like oil field. Not all data is useful and available in format which can be used directly or immediately.
8269 2018-01-22 05:05:47 100%. So important. People think if they moisturize when they have acne it will make them break out but actually if you don’t your skin tries to compensate by producing more oil and THAT makes you break out. I have terrible acne and use Cera Ve. LOVE. You can get it at Walmart
8270 2018-01-22 05:05:36 still trying to figure out why this woman at sagebrush asked for VEGETABLE oil for her SALAD
8271 2018-01-22 05:05:30 Castor oil saveddd my life
8272 2018-01-22 05:05:30 I drowned it in coconut oil earlier and then showered it all off hoping it’d help and lmao nope, I lightly tugged at a section and it snapped right off. I’ll definitely not be washing it for a while now 
8273 2018-01-22 05:05:10 trimming often helps put a lot. also sleeping on a silk pillow helps bc cotton absorbs oil from your hair. avoid dry shampoo. eat lots healthy food and drink lots of water.    invest in some leave in conditioner for sure! Its A 10 brand works really good
8274 2018-01-22 05:05:08 Asparagus with olive oil, sea salt, and freshly ground pepper.
8275 2018-01-22 05:04:49 Worldwide demand for energy produced from oil, gas, and coal is projected to increase significantly over the next two decades.  If Supply doesn’t come from Canada, it will be supplied from other countries.  Killing Canadian projects only benefits foreign energy producers.
8276 2018-01-22 05:04:48 It’s the point of reference just like usd currency  when u.s. help Saudi oil in exchange to be the usd currency rate.
8277 2018-01-22 05:04:34 So, basically data is available in abundance, like oil was, earlier. Human attention is a scarce resource, like oil now is.
8278 2018-01-22 05:04:23 Is there a way to get oil glands removed from your face
8279 2018-01-22 05:04:09 Today I realized that there is an Asian woman who worship White culture so much that she has to imitate the life of European oil painting. SMH.
8280 2018-01-22 05:04:00 I think it’s about the money that gets bet on both sides, not on actually what they think the score will be.
8281 2018-01-22 05:03:56 #Market yawned at #shutdown drama last week and #JMMC was positive so #oil should . Fingers crossed both trends continue this week. #futures; #OOTT; #WTI; #equity

8284 2018-01-22 05:03:33 apparently my cat likes to eat coconut oil
8285 2018-01-22 05:03:30 I hate coconut oil. I feel dry as hell after I use it and my lips turn black whenever I use it on my face.
8286 2018-01-22 05:03:13 Here’s the deal....in NY Metro area he’s been a boil on our ass for decades.  He’s skirted the law on so many occasions it would make your head spin....No offense to you personally, but you and millions of others were sold a bill of goods by a snake oil salesman....truth....

8289 2018-01-22 05:02:26 The rally which we saw in Brent oil is over from 27 to 70, which took approx 24 months, we expect after the last week's negative reversal Brent oil has potentials to slide again back to 57 to 32 dollars against 71 in next 2 years , risk rewards are not favourable

8292 2018-01-22 05:02:25 This was right after Edmonton's second gal last night. Just a friendly reminder to my fellow Oil fans that there are some real actual #OilersPositives
8293 2018-01-22 05:02:23 @viriyaakarunaa i meant to ask you when you posted about it but how did you know the oil set you got was diluted?
8294 2018-01-22 05:02:21 Yes I know. I am just adding a point. Current data is lot of noise. Properly extracted and refined data is of value. Only difference is u dont discard any data. You can use it n number of time with new data to arrive at more meaningful info unlike oil which isn't reusable
8295 2018-01-22 05:02:20 My hair is thinning so I finally decided to put my castor oil to good use
8296 2018-01-22 05:02:12 Gettin' ready to throw some chicken wings in a pan of oil and crack a beer. :)

8299 2018-01-22 05:01:27 The only thing I hate about doing hot oil treatments and deep conditioning treatments is the shut running down your ears and neck
8300 2018-01-22 05:01:25 Arre tum toh extra virgin olive oil nikle
8301 2018-01-22 05:01:03 @tavleen_singh All these people get instructions from GLOBAL LOBBY funded by Vatican Church& OIL money..these people forget one thing,After eliminating real secularism in INDIA..Vactican Church & Mughal leftover in INDIA will fight.because their agenda is to promote own religion.
8302 2018-01-22 05:00:38 yes vitamins are so good, but (even tho it may sound weird) taking prenatal vitamins actually work better than the hair, skin, and nail vitamins because they contain more biotin and theyre all around healthier for you. also apply a small amount of coconut oil to your hair
8303 2018-01-22 05:00:16 After a 1942 shipwreck off Newfoundland, locals having never seen blacks before tried to scrub clean those survivors thinking they were covered in oil! #facts
8304 2018-01-22 05:00:11 Coconut oil doesn’t work

8309 2018-01-22 04:59:57 This the worst thread ever. Coconut oil fights bacteria and fungus. Is it for everyone? No. Is it ok to scare dumb people into not using it? Also no. Know your fucking facts people
8310 2018-01-22 04:59:53 No, just someone with an education and lots of work experience, including the area of the country where Trump was a lying, self-obsessed, bankrupting blowhard, long before his TV fictional image. He's a snake oil salesman through and through. Sorry you can't see it.
8311 2018-01-22 04:59:40 We have family breakfasts every Saturday and keep the oil until Sunday night.
8312 2018-01-22 04:59:34 I think in Korea they eat a decent amount of horse so hopefully they’re not being slaughtered just for their...oil?
8313 2018-01-22 04:59:34 It made my day  also if you need anything, let me know!!! I can make you an essential oil mix
8314 2018-01-22 04:59:16 I bought a new shampoo, conditioner and hair oil set today and my hair feels amazing. It’s so soft and shines real nice and smells amazing 
8315 2018-01-22 04:59:11 And don’t assume a plane below you is going to stay there. I’m investing in smoke oil. And not accepting unasked-for flight following. 30/
8316 2018-01-22 04:58:59 I legit just wanna be rubbed down w/ some eucalyptus oil.
8317 2018-01-22 04:58:54 あと欧米都市の賃貸物件は家賃がめちゃくちゃ高い。基本家具つきだから初期費用は少ないけど、モナコ、パリ、ロンドン、マンハッタン、モントリオールなんかがクソ高い。上海も東京より高いけど平米当たりバンクーバーの半額くらい
8318 2018-01-22 04:58:40 worry about not smelling like rotten catfish and old frying oil b4 you come @ me
8319 2018-01-22 04:58:36 Try putting a couple drops of tea tree oil in a cup of warm water and apply that with a qtip! This has saved me from so many piercing travesties
8320 2018-01-22 04:58:30 Love using coconut oil when it comes to taking off my mask of makeup
8321 2018-01-22 04:58:24 I have this girl on my Facebook talking about how she puts coconut oil on her pussy.

My Facebook was also deactivated today.
8322 2018-01-22 04:57:53 I’m pretty sure we all know coconut oil shouldn’t be used as a moisturizer lol. Y’all reaching

8332 2018-01-22 04:56:31 うふふっ…
8333 2018-01-22 04:56:29 Honestly, I just drink lots of water to clean my system. Not castor oil and stuff 
8334 2018-01-22 04:56:28 Avocado oil is so underrated
8335 2018-01-22 04:56:26 Did the oil barrons stop paying you to squash #solar or are you just doing a PR post?
8336 2018-01-22 04:56:21 เราไม่ปั่นนะ แต่เราฟังทั้งวันเลย
8337 2018-01-22 04:56:17 If anyone wants to take me to Casa Brava and take my car to get an oil change this weekend, I won’t fight you about it.
8338 2018-01-22 04:56:13 There  could have been a follow up question on how the fiscal deficit could be contained with the rise in price of oil.
8339 2018-01-22 04:55:47 Products without petroleum are best. Coconut oils, sweet almond oil, jojoba oil. Edible grade oils without the cheap petroleum fillers are preferable. Petroleum dries skin out long term so you need to reapply more and more. And it stops moisture absorption.
8340 2018-01-22 04:55:46 coke then oil 
8341 2018-01-22 04:55:37 Eyelash tips in order of importance:
1. Don’t wear eye makeup everyday!
2. Use Latisse or a conditioner/growth serum. 
3. Curl them daily. 
4. Dye them once or twice a month.
5. Take biotin.
6. Remove eye makeup with castor oil. Be gentle. 

Please let me know your thoughts =]

8346 2018-01-22 04:55:04 At least you called them out. I’m sick of this joke of a carousel ride that is the Edmonton oilers. Up and down and up and down and there is absolutely no method to the madness. If you won a cup in the glory days, you’re qualified for a job with the oil

8352 2018-01-22 04:54:06 McConnell is a snake oil salesman. He’s made this promise before and reneged. Can’t possibly be trusted.
8353 2018-01-22 04:53:52 I tried a tea homemade tree oil/olive oil scalp mask the other night and my dandruff is GONE :o

8355 2018-01-22 04:53:43 My observation this weekend was that prices of some basic commodities have gone down, especially in the main big retailers. Meat, cereal, cooking oil, mealie meal among others. Store Mgrs say Local  suppliers are playing part in bringjng prices down.
8356 2018-01-22 04:53:26 End of a political career: ex-politburo member Dinh La Thang was sentenced to 13 years in prison. Former state oil executive Trinh Xuan Thanh, who was allegedly kidnapped from Berlin by Vietnamese agents, was sentenced to life #vietnam #Corruption #trial
8357 2018-01-22 04:53:22 I remember getting goosebumps and tearing up listening to Obama shovelling his eloquent horse shit.

Best Snake Oil salesman...ever!

He could sell refrigerators to Siberian Reindeer herders in the dead of winter during a month long cold snap.
8358 2018-01-22 04:53:14 coconut oil is bad for people w dry skin or oily skin. i use coconut oil MIXED w honey to calm down my acne. it works for me.
8359 2018-01-22 04:53:13 Then I put lizard oil in my memory.
8360 2018-01-22 04:52:43 when theres anointing of oil and they rub your eyebrows off

8364 2018-01-22 04:52:35 Gua udah langganan digitalnya mereka. Worth every penny
8365 2018-01-22 04:52:33 The next best thing to hairspray. Put coconut oil in your hair in the winter and step outside. It won’t move 
8366 2018-01-22 04:52:28 Coconut oil is the most magical thing ever. I always have dry lips in the winter. Constantly applying chapstick. I put coconut oil on them before bed last night and i didn’t have to use chapstick once today. 
8367 2018-01-22 04:52:18 This sounds awesome but why arnica oil? It's toxic and durmatitis can result in constant use of arnica oil.
8368 2018-01-22 04:52:16 China erects 1 wind turbine every 30 minutes, while Trump's America goes for coal and oil. What a dick.

8373 2018-01-22 04:50:50 其實落幾多essential oil 都好，太通風嘅情況下，香味都唔會太突出。

而我嘅目標只係燒下啲煙味，所以效果幾好。

#煙民唔鍾意焗住煙味
8374 2018-01-22 04:50:41 20 Silver is to gold 1

8375 2018-01-22 04:50:34 Organic Coconut oil Cures Everything...
8376 2018-01-22 04:50:28 coconut oil smells so fuckin good
8377 2018-01-22 04:50:10 Yeah. I mean, we'll fry up some eggs and some other stuff and use the extra left over oil for something else later. We also sometimes just shove some beans in the pan to soak up all the oil if we have no more use for it though.
8378 2018-01-22 04:50:01 $90 million dollar oil re-refinery just announced for Bowden. Must be the carbon levy that attracted them. That plant has been mothballed for 17 years.

8383 2018-01-22 04:48:51 One more time for the people in the back sis!! Another tip mix a little oil into your lotion or hair moisturizer and it penetrates deeper into your skin and hair shaft.
8384 2018-01-22 04:48:51 I'll be selling my pontiac grand am for cheap next week! Great on gas, just put in a new transmission ($750), always changed oil, previous owner was an older lady who took good care of it. $1,200 and it's yours! DM me for more info.

8388 2018-01-22 04:47:51 Little bit of coconut oil 
8389 2018-01-22 04:47:46 This is literally the best snake oil I've seen since Bitcoin.
8390 2018-01-22 04:47:29 I put coconut oil on my face once and that was by accident. Chile.
8391 2018-01-22 04:47:03 It’s because of his interview. He stated that the Oilers are going to get him an English teacher soon. He’s happy about it. People are upset the Oil never provided this earlier. Jesse said he has had a real difficult time.
8392 2018-01-22 04:46:38 Data is not the oil. Its more like oilfield. How much u extract depends on your algorithms, mining techniques. As goes with refinement process, various algos yield data of various value
8393 2018-01-22 04:46:21 膣には誰もいませんよ...？

8409 2018-01-22 04:43:16 Last night I went to roll some lavender on my forehead to help treat this awful cold, but forgot I had taken the roller out bc it wasn't working.
Ended up dumping oil all over my head.
 
I'm sure there's an annointing joke in there somewhere but I'm too tired to think it up.
8410 2018-01-22 04:43:14 Toe to Heel Air Injection (THAI) Process; there have been 6 oil field tests of this petroleum recovery process.  Progressing towards commercialization.  No water consumption, practically!

8412 2018-01-22 04:42:48 everyone's skin is different hun i use coconut oil every night to take off my makeup & my acne really cleared up! do what works for y'all ladies :)
8413 2018-01-22 04:42:47 applying olive oil inside my pussy using one of those old oil cans like the tin man used in the wizard of oz because i once heard someone refer to the uterus as an oven and i spent all day preparing the batter and a drizzle of olive oil really makes a baguette taste better
8414 2018-01-22 04:42:31 オイル君の隣、あったかいなりぃ
8415 2018-01-22 04:42:24 The wall is the epitome if stupidity.  No walls on our northern border.  Clearly racist. What about a wall down around the Mar-a-Lago area....but make it see-thru so trump can see the oil rigs off the coast when that Florida waiver is tested in court.
8416 2018-01-22 04:42:24 Left my coconut oil 
8417 2018-01-22 04:42:15 coconut oil rubdowns 
8418 2018-01-22 04:42:14 It's a roll on oil blend for headaches and I'm convinced there's actual magic in it.
8419 2018-01-22 04:41:59 I need to get some oil so I can fry chicken tomorrow
8420 2018-01-22 04:41:47 What’s the point then?  That the Oilers are not forcing him to learn English at a better rate?  Or supplying him with better tools to learn English?  I just think it’s a “reach” to trash Oilers if that’s the point. There’s way easier trash to find with Oil.
8421 2018-01-22 04:41:40 What is horse oil?????
8422 2018-01-22 04:41:28 I can see the Oil really shake things up with this  change. Good for them
8423 2018-01-22 04:41:21 What do you use? I swear by coconut oil but I’d rather not use it (on my face) if it’s bad in the long run.
8424 2018-01-22 04:41:18 @privileged_24 this maggots r super heroes to survive such hot oil but I'm not there, which KFC is this again?
8425 2018-01-22 04:41:16 Coconut oil literally just sits there. Doesn’t moisturize anything.
8426 2018-01-22 04:41:15 Can I use olive oil on my face?

8442 2018-01-22 04:39:51 And that's why I use coconut oil to seal in moisture on my hair but Shea butter as a body butter. Leaves you feeling deeply moisturized.
8443 2018-01-22 04:39:34 My MIL said the same thing. She said in this case the squeaky wheel does get the oil.

8447 2018-01-22 04:39:03 Sis don’t even know what she talking about  like just cause u don’t wash your face at night and get acne doesn’t mean everyone else has bad run ins with coconut oil. Shit helped my skin on so many levels.
8448 2018-01-22 04:39:00 Boom, followed you back. Now, a little olive oil. Into the pan.
8449 2018-01-22 04:38:54 Show me the proof. You snake oil, used car salesman.

8461 2018-01-22 04:36:32 It's hard to find vegetable oil (olive oil is too expensive here) so sometimes we buy bacon or even full pork pieces and save the fat in a jar

8463 2018-01-22 04:36:06 lrt ive always been told coconut oil is good for dry skin and i actually didnt know that it's a sealant but now that i DO know it makes sm more sense it never lasts for more than 2 hours when im sitting around at home and i always find it uncomfortable and just sitting on my skin
8464 2018-01-22 04:35:56 @khalid_pk Oil tankers strike being observed today . Please reconfirm as no petrol shall be delivered to pumps in karachi today.
8465 2018-01-22 04:35:53 Good! I can't fix a car but I can change oil and brakes etc and it's empowering!
8466 2018-01-22 04:35:51 Im going dark. I've got my own hockey game to play tonight. But im interested in hearing your thoughts...clearly McLellan shares your opinion because its never been done and i must be missing something. RNHs injury may shed light on alt possibilities
8467 2018-01-22 04:35:49 Just a question of time before this applies to oil as well, @gmbutts @cathmckenna @RachelNotley
8468 2018-01-22 04:35:49 These tow trucks guys are devils. They pour oil on streets, vandalize traffic light and the list goes on.
8469 2018-01-22 04:35:37 RNH tends to get the tougher match up and if he doesn't, it'll be up to McDavid.
8470 2018-01-22 04:35:36 Being slick on TV doesn't make a worthy PM. Look at Cameron! Look at Blair! I'd rather have a PM with an awkward manner & decent policies than another snake oil salesman. You media types are so obsessed with the superficial! When will you learn? All that glitters is not gold.
8471 2018-01-22 04:35:30 I went to bath & body to get one of their wall things cuz my oil diffuser just isn't working all that great anymore, & all the smells they had except for the ones that were essential oil based made my head just ache lol

8479 2018-01-22 04:34:35 Head and shoulders is TERRIBLE for dandruff actually it doesnt help anybody. I think tea tree oil can help. Also I used the shea moisture anti dandruff conditioner and it worked great!

8481 2018-01-22 04:34:21 I'm allergic to olive oil and I'm very sad about it
8482 2018-01-22 04:33:28 Fair enough. He's definitely the best two way guy. Although Im not sure i understand your last comment...why does this change who the other team puts out against McDavid? He'll always play top D...top line depends on many factors and i dont see how RNH affects that.
8483 2018-01-22 04:33:23 Face oil organik gitu. Banyak indie brand indonesia organic gt kok. Ada organicsupply, spoil, spoil, indoganic. Sama pake masker organic kek velrose dll

8497 2018-01-22 04:30:13 Not surprising. Details leaked to public.  Investigations take forever, ppl left in place and have plenty of time to destroy evidence.
8498 2018-01-22 04:30:04 honestly its not Albertan's fault it's the oil corporation. AND Ottawa's for not promoting green solutions instead.
8499 2018-01-22 04:29:48 I just thought since girls who wear natura hair use a lot of oil they would want it to not stain easily. But I aint a girl so 
8500 2018-01-22 04:29:26 Grabe yung oil galing sa bacon ughh
8501 2018-01-22 04:29:11 I just tried to do that "oil pulling" thing but accidentally swallowed all of it 5 minutes in so
8502 2018-01-22 04:29:10 I’m gonna try tree oil now
8503 2018-01-22 04:29:08 As he's their best two-way C and it's not even close, my answer remains no. Not sure why Oilers would want to have McDavid face the opposing teams top line & top pairing.
8504 2018-01-22 04:29:06 This the same guy that sold our national parks to oil companies right
8505 2018-01-22 04:29:00 Only the snake oil salesman can give us NUCLEAR ANNIHILATION!

8507 2018-01-22 04:28:48 The liberal govt thought consultation was “extensive, open-minded, and genuine”.
They also thought ICBC was just a bit over budget, money laundering wasn't an issue in B.C. Casinos, Alberta Oil companies were ok to have as donors, and the content election system worked.

8509 2018-01-22 04:28:38 I live in Boise, where the shape of the valley is prone to inversions, but there’s no oil refineries or factories in the Treasure Valley. So the air pollution isn’t bad, it’s just super cold.
8510 2018-01-22 04:28:24 @bathbodyworks are you getting rid of your essential oil with olive oil line for good? I'm obsessed with it, it's the only thing that's worked for me and I don't want my favorite scent to be gone forever!
8511 2018-01-22 04:27:58 i love rubbing peppermint oil all over my face and feeling the BURN!!!!!!!!
8512 2018-01-22 04:27:56 Yes and there are various other non oil based reforms being developed to uplift Venezuela’s fall- for details wait for our Barrel Digest to publish soon.
8513 2018-01-22 04:27:54 Even after the mega merger oil retailers are falling, why?
8514 2018-01-22 04:27:50 Laced? Like some evil dude was in his garage dipping gummies in the oil.  Besides, I'd rather see a kid using marijuana in edible form than Ritalin. Much less dangerous and wouldn't be surprised if it was better.

8521 2018-01-22 04:27:00 your homage killed 3/5 of my players. The other two came back with casks of oil and burnt everything outside to the ground.
8522 2018-01-22 04:26:44 R you sure that’s right for my skin tho? My skin, apparently, is not dry but it’s dehydrated, whatever that means, so as a result it produces excess oil which causes me to break out so so much :,,,,(

8532 2018-01-22 04:25:31 Why do you hate coconut oil so much? Just cause you had bad examples doesn’t mean anyone else has. And I can name ALOT of comedogenic products you use not knowing that. If you wash your face daily. Morning and night, it shouldn’t be an issue.
8533 2018-01-22 04:25:24 Margarine was invented in 1869 by a French chemist named Hippolyte Mège-Mouriès, who substituted the natural oil butterfat in butter with  beef fat oil, which when mixed with milk, would produce a cheaper form  of butter. No wonder it tastes awful

8549 2018-01-22 04:22:52 No youre just hating on PSG and their "oil money". I dont see you hating on the Bundesliga. Every german team that qualified for the Europa League got crashed out while every french team advanced to the round of thirty two. I can even recall Mainz losing 6-1 to Anderlecht.

8551 2018-01-22 04:22:38 His best deal was selling a lot of land in west palm to a Russian who needed to park money. Literally, that’s it. He was awful in AC, his contracts with nbc were likely boiler plate w some weird but not serious concessions to him. He’s twisted quite the tale, “snake oil” id say

8567 2018-01-22 04:19:32 Just washed the coffee/coconut oil off of my eye baggage.  Gotta say - I can definitely notice a decrease in puffiness & little wrinkles. Pretty awesome, and it smells amazing!
8568 2018-01-22 04:19:26 I feel he's capable at both. He's not lit it up as a playmaker or a shooter. I do think he's a damn good all around player that could grow into a finisher on, let's say, McD's line. There is a reason he ends up on the 3rd line on this team, would you try him on the 1st? I would.
8569 2018-01-22 04:19:23 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?
8570 2018-01-22 04:19:21 My Husband just got home from working on his car all day with his brother, and he reeks of oil.

8575 2018-01-22 04:18:49 I know a 10 year old who lived in Egypt with their parents in the oil business for many years, and when the job was finished they had to return to America with their parents when they were young adults. But who would want to live in a S***hole like Egypt anyway.

8581 2018-01-22 04:17:42 Try making salad with some truffle oil and feta cheese. High-quality ingredients make all the difference--organic, whatever, it's a cliche but that's for a reason.

8585 2018-01-22 04:17:24 I hear coconut oil is good for oil pulling! I however can't get with the movement

8590 2018-01-22 04:16:26 Reading folks fiercely defending oil sands expansion, LNG & coal industries makes me think as long as folks face unemployment they will literally do anything to the earth to feed their families. Can’t say I blame them. Does solving climate change have a chance? #bcpoli #cdnpoli

8600 2018-01-22 04:14:39 My natural Shea butter and lavender oil came in over the weekend
8601 2018-01-22 04:13:53 It'll probably take some time for you to adjust to not washing your hair every day. But in time, you should notice a difference. Also, I use tea tree oil (not sure if that'd work for you, though).
8602 2018-01-22 04:13:49 He's always had an underrated shot but he's a far better playmaker. When he has wingers who can actually finish, there hasn't been an issue.

8615 2018-01-22 04:12:31 Is there a way to get around the Crisco Oil?
8616 2018-01-22 04:12:16 Reading the constitution never made anyone an expert in constitutional law. This is a short-sighted and simplistic level of thinking that allows you to be easy prey for charlatans and snake oil salesmen.
8617 2018-01-22 04:12:11 If I don't use a shampoo that strips the oil from my hair then it doesn't even look like I washed it. Smh
8618 2018-01-22 04:12:10 The mood swings & depression right before and toward the end of your cycle, crippling gas, feeling ok to feeling like the tin man with no oil in a matter of hours after your period starts.
8619 2018-01-22 04:12:08 I hope the description I embedded shows up, but if not this is by Kehinde Wiley, John, 1st Baron Byron, 2013 (oil on canvas)
8620 2018-01-22 04:12:05 coconut oil is the best thing to have ever been brought into my life
8621 2018-01-22 04:12:02 Tfw you finally wash 4 days of oil and dry shampoo out of your hair and it's silk and sexy and you should go out and enjoy it. 

And then realize it's 11pm and that will never happen.

8622 2018-01-22 04:11:56 idk bout yall but coconut oil did WONDERS for my skin 
8623 2018-01-22 04:11:54 Oh go drill an oil well or do some fracking at the base of the Statue of Liberty....or sell it back to the French!
8624 2018-01-22 04:11:53 Coconut oil is great with hair growth though
8625 2018-01-22 04:11:29 They are not they are not oil tankers!
8626 2018-01-22 04:11:17 i mix it with my vitamin e oil so i don’t see much of a difference so i may try it by itself
8627 2018-01-22 04:11:15 @iamdbanj does your slap smell like hot oil
8628 2018-01-22 04:11:14 Oil tanker walon ne hartal kr Di hai koi batain manwani hn I don't know the details
8629 2018-01-22 04:11:03 If I'm part of that crowd let me say that it isn't about destroying an industry. Some form of oil extraction (and esp. gas) will be around for a while. 

We're mostly concerned about large scale expansions like #kindermorgan and Teck's proposed mine. Unneeded in the long-term.
8630 2018-01-22 04:11:01 Yeah I have combo skin as well coconut oil breaks me out really really bad

8635 2018-01-22 04:10:12 @OfficialJLD Hi! I know I’m a rando on the Internet but my mom had Breast Cancer and one thing we found to help was CBD oil. Idk if you have nausea from chemo but check it out if you do.
8636 2018-01-22 04:10:04 Let the healing oil of God flow from the top of your head to the sole of your feet..  Be made whole! In the name of Jesus!!

8638 2018-01-22 04:09:45 That's a rich fantasy life you got going, ivan. The entire Douth went red in '72. When were you counting 30 yrs from? The South was solid red in '72, '84, & 2000. That hole you're digging, is it for oil? Gold? To China? You should actually READ a book.

8640 2018-01-22 04:08:56 If anyone’s looking to grow out their eyebrows I’ve been using jojoba oil on my face since November and they’re now a forest #tips
8641 2018-01-22 04:08:49 First not getting it soggy with oil was the trick. After that the thing I wasn't getting right for awhile was not enough salt.
8642 2018-01-22 04:08:43 yeah I get BAD dry patches on my skin and coconut oil has been the only thing that's ever helped me, my skin is so SMOOTH and soft and nice when I used it consistently and I never break out w/ it but whatev. I'm gonna try the other oils she recommended tho
8643 2018-01-22 04:08:40 I’ve BEEN saying this coconut oil is sooo overrated like I dont use it for my hair or skin it does not work for me
8644 2018-01-22 04:08:39 40 years! no. fossil fuels will be long gone by then. 

EVs (personal, light duty, transit) will cause a permanent decline in oil demand in about 5-10 years. Once that happens, oil sands and Arctic resources will be locked in due to low profitability.

8645 2018-01-22 04:08:25 I dont completely agree he's a pure shooter myself. I do think he's a very capable shooter and he's got a tricky shot sometimes. I like that part of his game and I do agree it would be worthwhile to see him play on McD's line. Do you think he's more playmaker than shooter?
8646 2018-01-22 04:08:22 Coconut oil and Vaseline is calling my name ! 
8647 2018-01-22 04:08:13 Yeah, the oil less the hallucinogens. Many healing properties.
8648 2018-01-22 04:07:59 Let me tell you something good. After practicing for a couple of weeks I'm getting really good at the perfect amount of oil, vinegar and salt on my salad.
8649 2018-01-22 04:07:43 Oil paintings always looked like fun to mess with. I remember an class that mostly studied inking where you draw with water & drop ink into the water to make pictures. It a looks like fun, will you be doing both traditional & digital??
8650 2018-01-22 04:07:42 The chili oil? Bruh. That stuff is more potent than sriracha.
8651 2018-01-22 04:07:38 I feel like, if you follow the instructions and massage your face religiously... with all that oil and wax... maybe...um... a whole lot of rice powder might uh... stick?  oh man... this seems like a must try!

8653 2018-01-22 04:07:09 A shower, coconut oil, lavender, and fresh sheets. I’ve never felt better. The lesson? I did this for myself all on my lonesome and it’s just a few simple things that make me feel okay.

8659 2018-01-22 04:06:48 It’s fine. There’s nothing wrong with it. Coconut oil is my ONLY facial moisturizer and it’s perf for me. Every bodies skin is just different.
8660 2018-01-22 04:06:15 Coconut oil is best to use on something dry because oil and water don’t mix but I agree 1000% Shea butter is better

8668 2018-01-22 04:05:35 Yes sis! That’s why some nights, especially when I deep cleanse, I moisturize with my lotion and lightly (I’m scared of oily skin) rub coconut oil to seal everything in (plus, the Vitamin E in the oil is nourishing too).

8710 2018-01-22 03:59:56 Anyone who puts coconut oil in their “how i got great skin” thread. Don’t believe them.
8711 2018-01-22 03:59:53 Do they still use hair from barbershops to mop up oil spillages

8902 2018-01-22 03:34:32 Cannot stress it enough. Coconut oil is a SEALANT. Especially for people who are acne prone its only okay to use it after you’ve cleansed your face, closed your pores with cool water, and moisturized. It locks in the moisture and wont clog pores cause theyre closed.
8903 2018-01-22 03:34:27 Got two diffusers going w/ peppermint essential oil. Gave izzy a back massage and played some water sounds w meditation and he is OUT.

8913 2018-01-22 03:33:41 Cotton and other natural fibers are the only way to go! I put oil in my equipment and trucks, not on my body!
8914 2018-01-22 03:33:35 I use cocoa butter oil after I get out the shower with a lotion or butter. aloe vera is good too.
8915 2018-01-22 03:33:31 I put coconut oil on my body not my face and it does wonderful for me everybody skin is different. Remember that
8916 2018-01-22 03:32:58 That ass needs some oil and a strong pair of hands,  sweet thing...I swear Ill try and remember the massage part of the massage but you are making it hard...and difficult too

You know, the kind you can get at health food stores, near the coconut oil and raw milk.

8932 2018-01-22 03:30:03 Well he is in charge now. Harper did the same sort of junk but he used our funds to do the dumb Action plans to promote the oil and gas industry. Politicians are odd. You can't do much about their decisions until election time. Best to vote them out; this stops the problems.
8933 2018-01-22 03:30:02 Thank you.. You’ll get it.. after i got it cut off, i only went to a shop to get the deads cut.. I used Shea Moisture products and coconut oil.. that’s IT! Nothing extra.. Hair started growing like a MF!

8943 2018-01-22 03:28:40 through the process of joining with and buying other companies out we eventually gained control over cleveland's refineries and in 1870 my pride and joy was born, the Standard Oil Company!
8944 2018-01-22 03:28:26 Also I just feel the need to say I look greasy as hell with all this coconut oil on but tomorrow morning the glow is on frfr
8945 2018-01-22 03:28:14 I’m prob the only person that spends 20 min every night running coconit oil all over my body. Whoops #esthiprobs
8946 2018-01-22 03:27:54 I hate coconut oil, whether it’s got the hair or for the skin. Does absolutely done nothing for me.
8947 2018-01-22 03:27:42 Como llegamos de mi viejo nos bañamos y volamos a la oil a comer una super hambur y Carlitos. Ahora si nos vamos a dormir como unos chanchitos con los amores de mi vida
8948 2018-01-22 03:27:27 Granted, I do mix Tea Tree oil into the coconut oil as well so it’s never straight coconut oil. But it’s not meant as a moisturizer. I use my everyday moisturizer and then the dab of the coconut mixture! 
8949 2018-01-22 03:27:27 I’ve been putting tea tree oil on it
8950 2018-01-22 03:27:17 Yea coconut oil trash for your face lmaoo clogged my pores tf up

8954 2018-01-22 03:26:24 I hear the whale oil folks used to laugh in their drinks at electricity.  Not taking sides, just saying.
8955 2018-01-22 03:26:20 Aight maybe not coconut oil but olive oil and jojoba oil are sent from the skincare GODS
8956 2018-01-22 03:26:15 I have what i believe is very weird skin I have to moisturize but not with oil because I’ll just be oily or even break out
8957 2018-01-22 03:26:15 I’m lazy so I’ll probably never prep my hair the night before. But coconut oil is not my hair’s friend at all. I use it occasionally but it’s not for me. Stuff like grape seed, jojoba or avocado oils work great for me though.
8958 2018-01-22 03:26:04 deadass. I’m using coconut oil now as well. Seems to be the best bet
8959 2018-01-22 03:25:48 first &

8967 2018-01-22 03:24:15 initially we were one of 30 oil refineries in cleveland in 1865 but we soon surpassed all of our other competition and became the largest oil refinery when we joined with O.H. Payne.
8968 2018-01-22 03:24:02 Gotta find some apricot oil.
8969 2018-01-22 03:24:01 all currency is worth less now than it was in those times. Literally every currency in the world. This is normal. Think about the population raise. Emigration. Trade with other countries. Countries use dollar to buy oil.  had to be printed is so normal.
8970 2018-01-22 03:23:51 but what it will do is increase the odds of a major oil spill in B.C. either on land or sea.......

9021 2018-01-22 03:18:30 yooo witch hazel + tea tree oil
9022 2018-01-22 03:18:24 I love love love using coconut oil- only at night though because it’s so oily! It helps take off tor eye makeup too! I just let it absorb into my skin. Oh, AND it also helps your eye lashes grow! 
9023 2018-01-22 03:18:14 Coconut oil is really key.. 
9024 2018-01-22 03:18:09 I've always found this narrative humorous, as all the ex-Oilers who have coached the team did fairly good jobs. But let's make nothing into something.
9025 2018-01-22 03:18:06 Welp guess ima have to stop using coconut oil on my face 
9026 2018-01-22 03:18:05 Abortion is not murder. Denying healthcare like pro life politicians do to chip children and adults is murder....I will ask you again, are you dense, deaf , or what?
9027 2018-01-22 03:18:03 Avocado oil is definitely where it’s at. My hair loves it. Only thing I use coconut oil for is to remove makeup.
9028 2018-01-22 03:18:02 Yes, ..we would need elecricity to “make” hydrogen, ..and then pumps (electricity again), then high pressure tanks, then high pressure pipelines, then tanks, then big rigs (with diesel), then tanks ..in “station services”.. to refill tanks in cars.
..it smells the old oil ways !
9029 2018-01-22 03:17:54 Okay I’m going to add this and look for Bio Oil.
9030 2018-01-22 03:17:49 Who uses coconut oil on their skin tho? Da mek sense?

9038 2018-01-22 03:16:34 u should! it’s kind of expensive, the same as the foundation but it really is worth it. i’ve used it like three times & literally have stayed oil free everytime. by the end of the day, there is the TINIEST amount but nothing that makes u shiny or that is messing with ur makeup

9044 2018-01-22 03:15:53 Sooooo coconut oil isn’t a moisturizer??????? That’s where I’m fucking up at
9045 2018-01-22 03:15:52 yeah, right!  Collins got suckered and merkowski is letting them Drill for oil in a wildlife refuge as part of the tax bill!
9046 2018-01-22 03:15:43 I was expecting some kind of oil but that's crisco, isn't it?
9047 2018-01-22 03:15:38 Yes I love this. What I found started working for me was (1) using Bio Oil on spots & then moisturizer (2) always using moisturizer with sunscreen. Saw pretty fast results
9048 2018-01-22 03:15:28 I tried it. Only oil I had on hand was basil olive oil. Ridiculously bad idea .
9049 2018-01-22 03:15:26 ladies if you don’t use coconut oil in your life, what are u doin
9050 2018-01-22 03:15:24 Coconut oil as a facial moisturizer is a huge no no people.

9058 2018-01-22 03:14:20 definitely but i used other primers underneath it & i still got really oily but with the infallible matter primer i literally stay oil free all day
9059 2018-01-22 03:14:11 My go to is Thieves oil from Young Living but I also love using local honey.
9060 2018-01-22 03:14:11 it is! but its better for cooking actually! the molecules are too huge for the skin and they seal moisture instead of doing moisturizing. almond oil plus a few drops of vit e oil is better ^^
9061 2018-01-22 03:13:55 The oil from my smoked oysters spilled all over my phone....

9082 2018-01-22 03:11:49 Sir surprised people like you think making selling pakodas is some stop gap arrangement between unemployment and employment. Have you ever tried it? maybe you tried and failed because your pakoras gave people bad stomach. Be honest use good oil for frying

9097 2018-01-22 03:09:30 There is highest inflation,economic instability after RSSBJP came to power at the Center.All consumers goods are beyond common men reach including Toordal,vegetables,food grains, cooking oil.

9098 2018-01-22 03:09:04 Stop using the lotion at bath & body works buy the body cream instead. Oil based products hold on your skin better that perfume shit just dry your skin out.
9099 2018-01-22 03:09:04 Oil ? Wth sure, olive oil is actually really healthy.
9100 2018-01-22 03:09:02 Mas mutuo pakog virgin ang coconut oil kesa saimo.
9101 2018-01-22 03:08:29 Yeah, that too. I love coconut oil.
9102 2018-01-22 03:08:15 I believe this. I used coconut oil in my hair and left it in and it made it SO dry that I think it contributed to some breakage.
9103 2018-01-22 03:08:09 Yeah the combs and brushes were tearing my hair out and my scalp was getting itchy faster than normal so I brought it back. For some reason I thought it was worse than it actually is. Maybe cuz I detangled with oil before the shower today.

9119 2018-01-22 03:05:53 Fiat has none of that. If people come to believe the U.S. dollar is worthless, well, it's worthless. Its decline in purchasing power has been driven purely by the  Federal Reserve with artificial demand from oil producing nations -- the petrodollar
9120 2018-01-22 03:05:50 But many of us in 1998-2000 foresaw the supply crunch as a result of low oil prices. I wrote, with my colleague Jim Williams, in 2003, that a supply crunch was coming because of lack of investment.   Others over the years emphasized the same point.
9121 2018-01-22 03:05:49 If someone explained it to him, he’d just have Pruitt dismantle it so they could profit from oil exploration everywhere.
9122 2018-01-22 03:05:40 Bruh, I was changing the oil in my car, my dick starts to burn. I pull it out to see what’s up and a fucking red ant is on my dick... how... how.

9128 2018-01-22 03:04:59 There is not anything to argue with in that statement, it's the truth, in this, there is no difference between the parties. When it comes to Oil & Gas they will break every treaty, law, norm. These "Non Lethal" bullets are far from it, it's like they try to use them to kill.

9130 2018-01-22 03:04:48 Coconut oil. That’s it.
9131 2018-01-22 03:04:45 I added inula (elecampane) to my usual echinacea mix this year- which worked well. Also- the elderberries (even in tea) are always great support for viruses. Finally- I meant to mention thyme. I had thyme flower water in my syrup - and sniffed oil on a tissue. Thyme & sage tea!
9132 2018-01-22 03:04:37 dead simple. boneless pork ribs (I get mine at Costco). rub of choice (I use kosher salt, DinoBBQ Cajun rub, and some avocado oil). Crock pot for 4 hours on high. brush with sweet baby rays and finish in the broiler on high.
9133 2018-01-22 03:04:23 Irans majority  is of Islamic state. Besides Kurds... Its just territorial fight amongst each other. Just wait for it...because its probably over oil....I bet my last dollar. UN is the shit stirrer to bring in military. 
This is new world order agenda.

9159 2018-01-22 03:00:06 Stay away from it. Hydrogenated vegetable oil is full of trans-fats.
9160 2018-01-22 02:59:40 I really wish @jimmyjohnson would unblock me. I thought the alleged sex tape of him having his oil checked was him. I know now that it wasn't him. Please let me back in. #UnblockTom

9164 2018-01-22 02:59:00 Jeez, that chow mein was laced with the most intense chilli oil I've ever had. WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?!
9165 2018-01-22 02:58:58 I think potential impact on oil prices from paper trading (i.e. “positioning”) is highly exaggerated.

9167 2018-01-22 02:58:39 alright that's the 3rd reference to oil and pole-climbing I've heard tonight? 
I admit it, I have no idea what you guys are talking about? 
should I google it, or will you ever answer a question from me? 
btw, you've been kickin' some serious butt, huh? your last 2 stories! 
9168 2018-01-22 02:58:36 Untuk mengatasi ketombe, tambahkan beberapa tetes tea tree oil ke kulit kepala lalu keramaslah rambut seperti biasa.
9169 2018-01-22 02:58:24 I wish that were correct. Unfortunately it’s not.  Ex: Iraq invaded Kuwait in the 90’s, and in order to protect OPEC and keep oil prices low, we went to war to defend Kuwait from this hostile nation. War is surrounded by oil (money) and oil (money) is surrounded by war.

9173 2018-01-22 02:57:47 What if they're too dumb to realize they're hungry and they needed like some kind of auditory trigger (oil heating on a pan, knifes and plates clinking, a fridge opening) to be aware of their own hunger?
9174 2018-01-22 02:57:47 I was heating up coconut oil in the microwave to take off my makeup and my mom goes “you’re eating again?” So what if I was. I was shook.
9175 2018-01-22 02:57:46 America buys all of its oil from the middle east while it has a big reserve in Alaska. Why? If we buy all of their oil until we can't anymore, we'll have plenty left in reserve.

9197 2018-01-22 02:53:35 I will literally walk in the gym tmrw morning with my coconut oil hair mask STILL in so I can wash it out after my workout I do not care abt anyone else’s opinion
9198 2018-01-22 02:53:17 If y’all are having issue with your skin, replace your moisturizer with 100% organic cold pressed grape seed oil. Im telling y’all, it’s the truth 
9199 2018-01-22 02:52:40 Low oil prices are Modis’s best contribution to Indian economy don’t you think? (Of course can’t forget Chai & Pakodas).

9208 2018-01-22 02:50:55 Why my brother just tell me that he put Vaseline rather than black castor oil to grow facial hair. His words were “Xavier i put Vaseline on my face to make it shine” who raised this guy
9209 2018-01-22 02:50:45 If you didn't know by now that using coconut oil consistently on you're face cause you to break out N have clogged pores , then you stupid. 
9210 2018-01-22 02:50:41 store called “oil & vinegar”
9211 2018-01-22 02:50:32 I’m getting better about it! I like pizza now if it has oil on the crust or light light light marinara.
9212 2018-01-22 02:50:29 None of the above have been enough  oil cleansing is giving some relief
9213 2018-01-22 02:50:06 I bought an argan oil + morocco oil mix..let’s see if it actually helps my hair (I’ve heard really good things about it from close friends so we shall see)

9226 2018-01-22 02:48:42 It's not something which concerns the average homeowner, but obviously becomes significant in the event that, eg, someone finds oil
9227 2018-01-22 02:48:42 めちゃめちゃ寒い...
9228 2018-01-22 02:48:35 valid point 
9229 2018-01-22 02:48:28 Joo, I'd do that.  Their problems are caused by falling oil prices and an embargo placed on them by their major trading partners.  That's why they're going hungry.
9230 2018-01-22 02:48:22 I prefer Turkish oil wrestling
9231 2018-01-22 02:47:55 I've had 3 people call me while I'm trying to do my hair. I'm going to have to start reinforcing my "do not call me unless you are dying" rule.  Most of the shit they call me about could have been a text, snap, dm ANYTHING but a phone call. I got coconut oil all over my phone.

9248 2018-01-22 02:44:49 Here's the deal. Russia literally owns the president and half of Congress. China literally owns half of the country. Saudi Arabia literally owns our oil. The president has given full access of our intel community to our enemies. All because of "#HerEmails" and "#Dems".

9267 2018-01-22 02:42:20 I take solace in the fact that Saudi Arabia is going to collapse due to declining oil profits and that no amount of American intervention will save them. Pakistan and Iran would implode soon afterwards as well.

9290 2018-01-22 02:38:10 There are two worry points that will show up. One is that the interest rates are not coming down. The second is that the three-year gift of low oil prices seems to be behind. This puts stress on the finances as well as on inflation.

9298 2018-01-22 02:37:25 Oh thass cool  I started using almond oil . Been stalling on the Vitamin E oil
9299 2018-01-22 02:37:21 Stolen from @ziibiing : hope we can stay true to our hipster brand and use coconut oil instead of Crisco
9300 2018-01-22 02:37:17 I'm planning on trading futures by the time I'm 30, specifically crude oil, nat gas, spooz, and bonds
9301 2018-01-22 02:37:03 Ohhhh really, then why don't you reduce the oil prices soaring high Day to day . You want to earn from people .
9302 2018-01-22 02:36:59 Heaven is what your skin feels like after shaving, using a body scrub, moisturizing with a body oil & then getting into a bed with clean sheets.
9303 2018-01-22 02:36:57 Nawww my G i thought it was the fruit in its natural form.. Then I saw you cooked with oil loool
9304 2018-01-22 02:36:35 やるしかない

9307 2018-01-22 02:36:13 red wing heritage boots - look for a pair with the oil resistant rubber tread!!!
9308 2018-01-22 02:36:04 Can't make no type of plans to see a man bc my hair stink from this oil.
9309 2018-01-22 02:35:48 Coconut oil 4 lyf3; literally, what CANT coconut oil do!
9310 2018-01-22 02:35:42 I need to re up on my Jamaican Castor oil that is all
9311 2018-01-22 02:35:41 Jamaican black Castro oil is the shit. But man it stink.
9312 2018-01-22 02:35:38 That isn't a citation. And a nuclear accident is not the same as intentionally poisoning the environment. Oil spills will increase, and cleanup won't happen, with deregulation. Do you understand what that does to the land, water, flora and fauna? Apparently not.
9313 2018-01-22 02:35:23 "Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not..." ~Psalms 141:5
9314 2018-01-22 02:35:02 OIL DIFF: 5.36 -> 5.38
9315 2018-01-22 02:34:31 the best exfoliator! I use it after the camellia oil when I wash my face. I only use it maybe once a week and it buffs away all the dead skin/grimey makeup residue. Most exfoliators are too harsh for my skin and leave it super red/inflamed, but I loveee the enzyme powder
9316 2018-01-22 02:34:30 Rubbing yourself down with a mix of peppermint, lemon and clove oil with your favorite carrier oil >>> 

Im in heaven right now. I feel so relaxed now.
9317 2018-01-22 02:34:24 Seriously? Crisco oil?
9318 2018-01-22 02:34:09 Lemme tell y’all that coconut oil saved my fucking skin
9319 2018-01-22 02:33:41 My favorite dispensary got raided, so now I can’t make cannabis coconut oil tonight. Boo. Fuck trump and fuck sessions. With no vaseline. Assholes.
9320 2018-01-22 02:33:41 Yes yes I know my hair smells like coconut oil I’m tired of people telling me that 
9321 2018-01-22 02:33:40 idk why people obsess over coconut oil but it's not even top 3 for me lol
9322 2018-01-22 02:33:38 Zucchini, tomato sautéed with garlic and olive oil topped with feta cheese.
9323 2018-01-22 02:33:36 When God wanted to create man, He chose dust, that everyone walks past, as His raw material. He didnt choose gold or crude oil.
9324 2018-01-22 02:33:35 When God wanted to create man, He chose dust, that everyone walks past, as His raw material. He didnt choose gold or crude oil.
9325 2018-01-22 02:33:35 so many people think coconut oil and vaseline are moisturizers but in reality you're ruining your skin, basically chapstick twitter pt 2
9326 2018-01-22 02:33:29 One thing I do know is that I have to go to the grocery store on Tuesday. There is not a drop of olive oil left in the house.
9327 2018-01-22 02:33:23 so i bought coconut oil and idk if i should put it on my face overnight. Some ppl say it works, but other say it doesn’t and now idk 
9328 2018-01-22 02:33:14 Coconut Oil is not good for your face, it clogs your pores.
9329 2018-01-22 02:32:57 Keep holding your breath if you believe in a snake oil salesman.
9330 2018-01-22 02:32:50 The water cream is so light but dries down so soft. And apparently water based moisturizes are better for skin than oil based ones. I was honestly surprised by how much I liked it!
9331 2018-01-22 02:32:44 Depends on how much lye you use to make the soap. 
I actually prefer olive oil to lard myself.
9332 2018-01-22 02:32:40 4th bottle of this Tea Tree oil. #life
9333 2018-01-22 02:32:29 There's definitely some truth to what you say. However, there are many places in the world doing very well with wind (Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the UK) since around 2010. Oil interests appear to be a major hurdle in the USA.

9336 2018-01-22 02:32:13 Yes it does . My skin is sensitive to a lot of stuff so water and coconut oil for me does the job. Try doing face mask and etc
9337 2018-01-22 02:32:05 Global Cues: Oil Prices Rise On Decline In US Drilling, Syria Conflict

9345 2018-01-22 02:30:40 but I love both these items, they've made my skin sooo soft, I cant stop feeling it which is bad lol. I also have the Camellia cleansing oil and one of the rice enzyme powder exfoliators. Love the brand, cant recommend it enough.
9346 2018-01-22 02:30:35 Very productive stress cooking. 

I ended up with crab in white wine butter sauce with sautéed artichokes, asparagus and sugar tomatoes over angelhair. 

Resisted the urge to make garlic bread then decided on a goatcheese and truffle oil spread instead 
9347 2018-01-22 02:30:29 People literally use coconut oil to SEAL in moisture in hair.
9348 2018-01-22 02:30:08 Lol ya'll not putting coconut oil on ya faces because someone told you not to.....watch me have good ass skin by the time summer hits

9350 2018-01-22 02:30:02 Coconut oil has antibacterial properties
9351 2018-01-22 02:29:41 I had started getting dry patches on one side of my face a while back and I started just putting water and coconut oil on my face and my skin has been flawless since !

9359 2018-01-22 02:27:59 That would be awesome but the snake oil salesmen already got him.
9360 2018-01-22 02:27:40 Aku pake bio oil, cukup ga

9361 2018-01-22 02:27:40 As of recently Ex. Oil goes down 1% and $USO goes down less than 1%. Oil goes up 1% and $USO goes greater than 1%. Will be watching this the next few months with money down. I feel oil and US Oil is going to be good in 2018.  We will see.

9366 2018-01-22 02:27:24 Don’t tell Aaren but I just used some of his beard oil in my hair because it was dry and brittle and needed help and that’s the best I could do right now plus it was free
9367 2018-01-22 02:27:19 Or just a bunch of sticks. Or build a machine that distilled random plants into sellable oil
9368 2018-01-22 02:27:05 Cheese crust.
9369 2018-01-22 02:26:56 Oh, that's a good one.

Extra cheese is a given though. You can't have a Puljujarvi pizza without extra cheese.
9370 2018-01-22 02:26:48 Pretty much like our South San Joaquin valley. If it's not for oil or irrigation, it'd still be barren. Never realizing it's potential, and that'd be a waste
9371 2018-01-22 02:26:47 Coconut oil did nothing for me when I used it. Put it on my body, it would be gone by the morning. Put it on my face, I was greasy af and started getting acne. Put it in my hair, product build up. Never worked for me...
9372 2018-01-22 02:26:42 Senate adjourned for the night. Vote at noon tomorrow on 3-week CR. There will be lots of midnight oil tonight

9376 2018-01-22 02:26:32 The systemic savings that will come from the tranche by tranche migration of transport from fossil fuel combustion to electricity is the subject of the third part of Oil Fall. That said, in Chapter 7 you will see the cleaner Pump to Wheel calculation. And yes, it's a big deal.
9377 2018-01-22 02:26:17 Ok so I bought a thing of coconut oil, ponds cold cream cleanser & the neutrogena hydro boost water gel for dry skin and I swear to god if I don't get baby soft, honey smooth skin by the end of this month im gonna SUE
9378 2018-01-22 02:26:12 If so the whole world is happy... one day without US creating conflicts of oil or ”Humanitarian reasons”
9379 2018-01-22 02:25:21 How to oil paint?
9380 2018-01-22 02:25:15 How about Jalapeño Pepperoni (J.P.), extra cheese?

9399 2018-01-22 02:23:19 Another political hack. Your car runs on what? Your plastic products come from where? We should be dependent for oil on which nations that hate us? Every method of energy production and transport has risks. So does lacking energy. Remember the Dark Ages? Want to go back?

9404 2018-01-22 02:22:23 “Every morning I wake up next to a headscarf and coconut oil, I’m married to a black Queen.” A LINE! 
9405 2018-01-22 02:22:23 If y’all want an oil that’s skin friendly, use Vitamin E oil.

9407 2018-01-22 02:22:09 Everyone is mad they can’t use coconut oil on their face. Try jojoba oil  or sunflower seed oil

9409 2018-01-22 02:22:05 I am a progressive. I do not support big government or its policies and donors. I do not support big oil. I do not support NAFTA. I do not support the military industrial complex. I support Medicare for all and black lives matter. I am not a Russian troll.
9410 2018-01-22 02:21:57 Yes, per Wikipedia, esters of cetyl alcohol and jojoba oil are used as a substitute for spermaceti.
9411 2018-01-22 02:21:51 Right, but I do love almond oil in my hair it’s a thin layer of oil compared to coco or even olive.

9428 2018-01-22 02:19:04 for hair if you open up your hair shaft first there are 3 main oils that bind to water and get in the hair shaft to moisturize coconut oil, avocado and olive oil. any black natural hair website will tell you that but that's the closest thing you gonna get to moisturizing and oils

9440 2018-01-22 02:17:31 Dis you know that Rupert Murdoch and Dick Cheney own shares in genie energy. Which has the oil and gas drilling rights in the Golan heights.  Weird hey
9441 2018-01-22 02:17:25 I see somebody not able to deliver information about his own pictures, which is pretty meaningful... How tall is the oil rig? How far it is? Why are you so reluctant with the data? Hiding something?
9442 2018-01-22 02:17:11 Nice try, but the #Russian oil industry is suffering. Cannot pump most of their oil at $60/barrel. #Fracking in U.S. has brought oil down from $100/barrel to $60/barrel. Only on private lands too.

9448 2018-01-22 02:16:15 Yup crude oil is around 60-65 $. During UPA the price of crude oil was 110 but price of diesel nd patrol was less than what I'm paying today. Nd yes it matters when you have cried about oil prices during UPA govt. May God help us if the crude oil price touches the same level
9449 2018-01-22 02:16:10 Bless you! And I am sending you the healing magic of, "ah, pooor baby." Have some tea. Have some soup. Nice hot shower, breathe some eucalyptus or tea tree oil, imagine you're inhaling white light. Gargle with warm salt water, sweet dreams & tweet me in the morning, darling.

9454 2018-01-22 02:15:36 When Ed Hochuli signals a first down, he takes a full windup like Dennis Oil Can Boyd. (The Oil Can Boyd reference shows you how long it has been since I followed baseball.)
9455 2018-01-22 02:15:29 I follow the UK sales numbers at SMMT and also the UK energy data pretty closely. Here's something most don't know: UK is a veritable California when it comes to wind power on one side, and trend shaping up in ICE vs EV. Oil Fall pays good mention of UK, actually. Cheers.

9461 2018-01-22 02:14:47 For the body this is definitely fine. As glycerin acts as a humectant & coconut oil as an emollient. Shea butter mixed in would act as an occlusive, further sealing in moisture that glycerin draws from the air. I appreciate this thread for making conversation about what’s what.

9477 2018-01-22 02:12:59 I spent 20 minutes on Sephora looking for a face oil since i ran out. Then i walked downstairs and made my own. I own every product in these $100 oil/serums. I can be such a “consumer” sometimes.

9486 2018-01-22 02:11:56 One point I lay out very carefully and in detail in Oil Fall is that it takes a long, long time to get to 1% and even 3%. But the 5% mark shows up in many domains as a take off point. Thanks for reading.

9586 2018-01-22 01:55:27 I’ll bet it’s an ‘essential oil’ class
9587 2018-01-22 01:55:18 Thank you for your service, and I work In the oil industry so business is doing good, but have a good night you're more formidable than most Trump Supporters
9588 2018-01-22 01:55:12 Phillies manager @gabekapler recommended we grease the street poles with coconut oil instead of Crisco.

Birdies!
9589 2018-01-22 01:55:04 lmao seulgi laughing at joy because she spread some of the tuna oil onto her roll of kimbap
9590 2018-01-22 01:54:50 うりり最高にcute
9591 2018-01-22 01:54:27 Doesn't any promotion of sustainable #palmoil simply weaken the case that palm oil -  and other substances that can cause even greater environmental havoc - be ultimately banned from all foods and other items? Need to consciously reconfigure everything towards this goal.
9592 2018-01-22 01:53:56 Cowboys are horribly overvalued in the desert. Must just know oil money will bet any odds no matter how horrible they seem
9593 2018-01-22 01:53:42 @APPropst  Could this return of reliance on cars cause an even worse economic problem if oil became hard to get in the US again? Could this trend spell huge potential disaster?
9594 2018-01-22 01:53:29 If so called sustainable #palmoil is the goal shouldn't all #deforestation be stopped by promoting new plantations not where there is rainforest but in regions where land is clearly not habitat? Is palm oil even a necessary ingredient or simply a convenient cheap one? @drbirute
9595 2018-01-22 01:53:26 Deuteronomy 12:17 (KJV)  Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill offerings, or heave offering of thine hand:
9596 2018-01-22 01:53:25 ok last month i was cooking eggs and the oil jumped too high and burned my arm and my upper arm and now i have burn scars , and it’s on the exact same arm i used to self harm . i hate that

9598 2018-01-22 01:53:09 Love the way carrot tea tree oil smells under my breasts 
9599 2018-01-22 01:53:02 It does! Same with bugs. Get a spray bottle with water and pure peppermint essential oil and spray it around all the borders. Safe for babies and pets.
9600 2018-01-22 01:52:40 I’ve been looking into tea tree oil, but I don’t have a job & am stingy w money
9601 2018-01-22 01:52:08 Oil and water.
9602 2018-01-22 01:51:57 Did the refs also have oil put on them? I don’t think they can grab a flag
9603 2018-01-22 01:51:56 People who are THAT into a game need to pick up a book, light some incense, and rub some peppermint oil on their temples. Oh wait, I know people who get this way over books... #football #thereisnowinning
9604 2018-01-22 01:51:43 that when i explain to my poc coworkers, who specifically suggest only coconut oil, because from their experiences/culture as poc, and it being what is the endall , it's what works FOR THEM, that it doesn't work for me, and why i use argan/almond to treat my DRY skin
9605 2018-01-22 01:51:09 My Yoni oil shipped, my pussy bout to be glistening 
9606 2018-01-22 01:51:08 ah yeah maybe u could cut down a bit if u have it a lot? and like for me tea tree oil was p cheap online and i just either mix a teeny bit in w moisturiser or mix w some water and put on any spots

9618 2018-01-22 01:48:35 because me acknowledging your feelings and pov in my previous response wasnt?  I don't have to apologize for your perception when the context of the thread tweet i rtd is specifically in regards to poc beauty, coconut oil being not useful for dry skin, and me SPECIFYING IN MY RT

9635 2018-01-22 01:45:31 Oil doesn’t say goddamn thing. Oil lacks the requisite organs to make sound and has no capacity for language.

9638 2018-01-22 01:45:00 In Scottsdale, AZ any time soon? Check out my five new thickly textured oil paintings at the PEJMAN GALLERY on Main Street.
9639 2018-01-22 01:44:54 Coconut oil is a sealant,it seals moisture in but also keeps moisture out.Research moisturizing oils instead
9640 2018-01-22 01:44:25 Domestic offshore drilling will be able to create more jobs and keep us from being vulnerable from countries exploiting our oil needs while expanding our economy and so those who desire, can keep their fancy SUV's.
9641 2018-01-22 01:44:04 You just have to make sure your use a moisturizing oil and not a sealant as coconut oil is
9642 2018-01-22 01:44:04 Is coconut oil still good for hair 
9643 2018-01-22 01:43:55 It also has that like. That coconut aura? That comes from heavy use of coconut oil. (Like it doesn't taste or smell like coconut but you can Tell)
9644 2018-01-22 01:43:39 People will probably never use Petro for everyday shopping, it’s intended for oil, gas, gold and metals trade. It’s still unclear but people can mine it (there is already a government website for people to sign up as miners, only Venezuelans)
9645 2018-01-22 01:43:28 Oil says “water doesn’t exist I have never seen evidence of water”
9646 2018-01-22 01:43:27 Aye keep paying your taxes to fund your proxy wars in the ME. Keep bombing innocent civilians in your quest for oil. USA causing more suffering worldwide than the Nazis
9647 2018-01-22 01:43:18 hey government where my cbd oil? but also, if that's no possible, could you maybe pop some money into the pain clinics because this bitch has been waiting over 8 months to get in and get diagnosed

9656 2018-01-22 01:41:29 I like Rachel too but I can't recall her talking about 'Big Oil'. Curious!
9657 2018-01-22 01:41:23 Compared to now... Bush is a Saint... Lol... Im kidding but if done again I think hed do things different especially with his oil ties that got us in the mess we got in 2011. STILL NOT AS BAD AS TRUMP. NOWHERE CLOSE
9658 2018-01-22 01:41:23 I just assume it's like an oil stain on your clothes, but crisco... on a lamp post.

9660 2018-01-22 01:40:42 funny you mention CDEV, my friend in oil & gas (who knows nothing about charts) mentioned them as a buy, said he works with them
9661 2018-01-22 01:40:34 wow. Can Coconut oil still be used on hair and body though?
9662 2018-01-22 01:40:32 Things I’ve convinced my roommates to invest in:

•oils for oil therapy 
•special lamps/strands for botany
•a fancy camera for me so that I can decorate our house with my own photographs
9663 2018-01-22 01:40:15 it blocks your pores and causes acne for a lot of people. hemp oil is good, tamanu oil, prickly pear seed oil, jojoba is alright for many ppl but also caused outbreaks for me
9664 2018-01-22 01:40:14 You should try it in an oil burner omg it rocks

9666 2018-01-22 01:39:59 Clogs your pores. Vitamin E oil is better. Ponds is a bomb facial moisturizer.
9667 2018-01-22 01:39:50 ...drizzle of olive oil, nit of oregano...
9668 2018-01-22 01:39:49 I wish you luck with your appointment. It took me some trial and error to find what worked for me and the fish oil and vitamin D definitely help too.

9671 2018-01-22 01:39:21 Maduro is not enslaving anybody. Stop the bullshit storm please. Petro will be used to allow clients to trade Venezuelan oil and other goods. It’s not going to replace the national currency anyway. Btw stop taking US msm seriously, at least on Venezuela

9673 2018-01-22 01:38:44 @_cingraham Popping inane argument that non investors don't disproportionately benefit from stock market investors. Oil and gas investors caused gas to fall from 3.50 to 2.75  saving single driver traveling 12k 9000 dollars per year or 9OK! over 10 years at NO RISK!!!

9681 2018-01-22 01:37:43 Lol it’s way better to wash your hair with cold water either way but the only time I can stand doing it is during summer. The blue from the Argan oil one looks like it’s washing out when you wash your hair but it doesn’t lol ever. It stays for good damn near
9682 2018-01-22 01:37:27 Is anyone surprised that this snake oil salesman did this?
9683 2018-01-22 01:37:26 would it still be treason if individuals involved were working together to take over the entire worlds oil production along with russia, saudi arabia, egypt, canada and the us?
9684 2018-01-22 01:37:20 #Kurds already have northern "Iraq" #Kurdistan how can they steal #Kurdish oil there ? If it's in the Iraqi constitution that they own it ? Stupidity at its best.

9686 2018-01-22 01:37:00 I only started using them about a year ago after an old friend from high school recommended we give them a try. I use the b*tch oil in a diffuser when I meditate and the spray at work because it’s so stressful. Aromatherapy absolutely cheers me. I’m trying the sleep blend next.
9687 2018-01-22 01:36:22 You're darker than Akon talking bout you're mixed... With what? Oil and dirt?
9688 2018-01-22 01:36:09 I haven’t used coconut oil in like a year  it takes too frickin long to become not oily
9689 2018-01-22 01:36:05 They already have southern #Kurdistan aka Iraqi Kurdistan their autonomous region buddy how can #Kurds steal #Kurdish oil ?

9695 2018-01-22 01:35:11 Yeah I agree but from my experience coconut oil doesn’t work well with face but everybody skin is different lol
9696 2018-01-22 01:35:08 The Argan oil is buy two get one free a lot or buy one get one half off lol. My hair doesn’t feel gross after using those dyes either. It actually feels hella soft. I used the midnight blue for that one, and the electric blue, and the emerald green and they were all true to tone
9697 2018-01-22 01:35:04 co workers about beauty issues, which from my very specific experience, and not generalizing as a whole i was expressing frustration with explaining to them why coconut oil does not and will not work for me and isn't an effective moisturizer fro someone with my skin type.
9698 2018-01-22 01:35:00 I need to buy aloe vera and vitamin e oil
9699 2018-01-22 01:34:58 People only make mistakes when our reptile overlords activate the fluoride stores in our brains. They do this to keep us from noticing how they are extracting oil from the grass in our front yards! WAKE UP SHEEPLE!
9700 2018-01-22 01:34:56 Thanks for this because I’ve been using coconut oil every day with no results 
9701 2018-01-22 01:34:41 You are still a loser Donnie!  You said the government would never shutdown because you are a great negotiator.  Instead, it looks like you are a snake oil salesmen trying to sell empty bottles as if they were filled with the cure for cancer.
9702 2018-01-22 01:34:22 Breaks my heart when my baby is sick even if she is 24. Time for an Epson salt and lavender bath, then essential oil rub down. Top that off with some vapor rub on her feet and the softest socks around. Poor baby girl. Send Bianca your strongest healing energies please.

9707 2018-01-22 01:33:14 I like those ones but I always have to mix conditioner in because the consistency of them is like gel  the one n only Argan oil dye is better imo. More vibrant and it doesn’t fade easily at all. I prefer it over ion 1000000000%

9711 2018-01-22 01:32:25 I have a question. Why would they buy nuclear plants when they have so much oil?
9712 2018-01-22 01:32:19 If US shale production was really about to surge again, then the oil drilling & service stocks would be performing better (along w/their fin results) which hasn't been the case.

9714 2018-01-22 01:32:01 i agree the tip is transcendant but the thread i was reading seemed to have some leadings about black culture relying heavily on coconut oil being a end all be all.  That was my interpretation, as a "white" person i suppose i'm not supposed to express my opinion in that lol
9715 2018-01-22 01:31:59 I’m a licensed Esthetician and it’s always hard to tell what is going on exactly but I would suggest exfoliating with a gentle exfoliant 2x a week followed by aloe Vera and oatmeal masks (they help with dryness and sensitivity) and use a beauty oil 10 mins before foundation
9716 2018-01-22 01:31:40 So in your frought and fever, you peered into every hole, you stretched and spiraled recourse to battle the swollen beast with ancillary rest and abundant fluids. But the credit goes to the gratuitous ghost water and snake oil?!?

9718 2018-01-22 01:31:24 I’m lifting an eyebrow at that description of Halifax. And St. John’s is an “oil town”?

I will say, though, that the writeup of Charlottetown is both endearing and accurate.

9720 2018-01-22 01:31:14 So he gives them a billion dollar tax break, opens national park lands and the entire national coastal waters for oil drilling and fracking, gets a half-million payoff when he's thinking of retiring?
If he doesn't run, he gets to keep it.

9738 2018-01-22 01:28:42 Nice win @Maxpalaga I lost a bet with my cousin Oilers vs Canucks game so Oil kings vs Blazers was double or nothing. So if I lost I would have had to buy him 6 beers. Cookies 
9739 2018-01-22 01:28:32 but any ways, regardless of race, all skin types exist across every spectrum, i was speaking explicitly of my own personal experience, in my own work place, and why coconut oil is not a moisturizer and is not efficient to treat the specifics of DRY skin

9746 2018-01-22 01:26:51 I actually have the Clinique toner and moisturizer set but always bypass the moisturizer to use coconut oil 
9747 2018-01-22 01:26:27 i get the feeling the equity mkt is ok until ten yr gets to 4%.....long duration guys will take a big hit...but...just my guess..i do think oil can regain 100$ tho
9748 2018-01-22 01:26:23 After you vacuum use eucalyptus oil and put a few drops on the floor boad. It drives bugs away. They hate the smell of it

9852 2018-01-22 01:10:20 Yep, I was raised a Catholic and babysat for a woman who went to a Foursquare church. She started drumming the anti-Catholic spew into my head when I was 13. I believed her. It was like going from a frying pan into a cauldron of hot oil.

9858 2018-01-22 01:09:42 it could be something ur eating, but try using coconut oil or repairing serum for hair. u can also try a leave in conditioner or hair mask. those always work well for me when my hair starts acting up

9860 2018-01-22 01:08:23 The stuff folks use to clean and lube their guns doesn't smell like what springs to mind when you hear "gun oil". It's a solvent and has a complicated, slightly sweet, oddly minty smell that can sometimes remind you of getting a filling at the dentist.

9873 2018-01-22 01:06:18 @georgikantchev In your Jan. 17 article on oil prices, you left out geopolitical risk from Venezuela.  From Nov. to Dec., oil production dropped 10% from 1.77 to 1.61 mmb/d.  3 1/2  years of collapsing global exploration is also key and your 1.3 mmb/d of 2018 demand is too low.

Tomato-seafood pasta!!

1. Fry garlic and olive oil together
2. Add seafood, mushroms and other ingredients, add tomato sauce and boil.
3. Finish by putting cooked earlier noodles in
4. Eat deliciously.
9880 2018-01-22 01:05:36 Where do you get the oil from?
9881 2018-01-22 01:05:35 OIL DIFF: 5.34 -> 5.34
9882 2018-01-22 01:05:27 Put Oil In Your Car if  You Haven't Done so already this year.
9883 2018-01-22 01:05:25 I got some essential oil vape pens and they’re actually really nice so who cares if I look like an idiot
9884 2018-01-22 01:05:10 Say we all dropped oil. What's to stop them from shifting their wealth into green energy? They're still, ultimately, pulling the levers. Imo the issue is we take direct action as extra curricular - we'll do it, but only at no sacrifice.
9885 2018-01-22 01:04:53 Email shutdown@koonsofsilverspring.com for you’re free oil change, tire rotation and inspection. We’ve had an amazing response so please be patient.
9886 2018-01-22 01:04:51 I also sent a DM to @WholeFoods but it was this afternoon at the new Union Station location in Denver.  I've also seen rice bran oil used.
9887 2018-01-22 01:04:46 "There's more Olive Oil on this than Popeye's Dick"
9888 2018-01-22 01:04:45 OIL DIFF: 5.27 -> 5.36
9889 2018-01-22 01:04:38 Are there any oil proof, me proof laptops?  If I don't get it slippery or wet, I'll probably drop it. Plus, I have to be able to use it for work-work.
9890 2018-01-22 01:04:36 and I hope Soros is in there somewhere....nice to spend money in Africa and other needy nations like Yemen now.....not enough oil or not needed by Israel...too bad...Bitch...no tree grows to heaven.
9891 2018-01-22 01:04:31 So you saying you can't cook with avocado oil?
9892 2018-01-22 01:04:30 Yeah man, this guy is a greedy con artist.  Online in business since 2001, as if that automatically makes someone an autority on blockchain.  You’re the perfect guru for idiots, stick to sell them snake oil for the next 10 years.
9893 2018-01-22 01:04:28 CBD oil did nothing for chronic knee pain for me.  
I do not take anything stronger than Tylenol, so I am safe.  
But the pain has been so bad at times that I've wished I'd just die.  
And I'm a 5 year cancer survivor too, for crap sake.  
Some pain is just that bad.

9913 2018-01-22 01:00:39 That's the only one? I personally liked the century old dirt bike that still had working spark plugs and non solidified oil. Then there's the good old submersible Enterprise, flames in space, and a 25 yr old Kirk whining that he's lost his joie de vivre. LOL.
9914 2018-01-22 01:00:35 if you think its about oil then this convo is over and US was never ally in Efrin they made that clear
9915 2018-01-22 01:00:26 @Reachout_mcd we had dinner pickup at 2475 Centreville Saturday. We have yet to have a good experience at this restaurant. Food is always old, and it seems they never change the oil in the fryers.

9964 2018-01-22 00:53:43 I am so over this dry winter skin. I feel like I need to just soak my face in argan oil for like an hour every day. Anyone have a snorkel I can borrow? 
9965 2018-01-22 00:53:35 Why aren’t we putting Carbon Taxes on Canada’s Car Manufacturers? Cars put an enormous amount of pollution in the atmosphere. Unbelievable Trudeau is actually giving them Billions in grants while charging Oil producers Billions in penalties. It defies logic
9966 2018-01-22 00:53:07 Suzanne’s making some Alice Springs chicken while I air cook sweet potato chips w/ avocado oil & Montreal steak seasoning.

9968 2018-01-22 00:52:59 This oil/gas industry will become Trump's ENRON, AIG, GM, Ford, and more. The CEOs are lining his PAC pockets for 2020 backing now. It's all in "da Hood" or da Tower! @RoyBlunt @RepSamGraves will join b/c they follow w/o morals, ethics or integrity. LIE more boys!
9969 2018-01-22 00:52:51 Thank you! I put coconut oil on my face and broke out like crazy!

9977 2018-01-22 00:51:35 Go in the direction of humanitarian. Not patriotism. I’m not insulting soldiers, mine fought every war, Purple Heart and silver star men. They had brown skin, went to fight a white mans war. For oil, opium, cocaine and money. It was never about patriotism
9978 2018-01-22 00:51:30 And they pay for their entitlements with oil that is running out
9979 2018-01-22 00:51:19 why coconut oil?
9980 2018-01-22 00:50:53 coconut oil can't even fix him smh
9981 2018-01-22 00:50:36 I just ate a couple slices of tomato with a little spoon of olive oil, spices and salt and it was delicious.
Of couse it doesn’t taste half as good as pizza does but it’s great for a snack.

9984 2018-01-22 00:49:43 It’s ok to be white.

It’s ok to be asian.
It’s ok to be hispanic.
It’s ok to be female.
It’s ok to be male.
It’s ok to be gay.
It’s ok to be straight.
It’s ok to be YOU. 

But it's NEVER okay to use put coconut oil on your face!!
9985 2018-01-22 00:49:36 you used avocado oil personally before ?
9986 2018-01-22 00:49:26 Gaunce is amazing on defence but couldn't score on a empty net.  Last night vs the Oil I was excited till I realized Gaunce had the puck and like he is Never going to score.
9987 2018-01-22 00:49:14 Yes , i always use a mattifying primer, powder and oil control setting spray
9988 2018-01-22 00:49:10 Yes it is but I give credit to the troops bc they know what is really going on, they are smart & there are so many Vets on social media who can give them the truth. Beside Pence has the reputation of a snake oil salesman.
9989 2018-01-22 00:49:05 オイルの気持ちにもなってよ…
9990 2018-01-22 00:49:00 マシュマーリンヘラクレスで全部解決するから…

9992 2018-01-22 00:48:54 omg coconut oil should help get it off
9993 2018-01-22 00:48:49 yeah something about the high fat content in avocado oil I think? makes it really really great for the face. I still keep coconut around for hair and new tattoos n stuff though!
9994 2018-01-22 00:48:34 Adentro... Afuera... Arriba... En el Río... No importa donde... Pero EXPLOTÓ FUEL OIL SEÑORES!!!

9995 2018-01-22 00:48:27 Shame. Africa &  democracy like oil and oil
9996 2018-01-22 00:48:25 Come up with some some more good "rational" ideas.....pro-life owns Trump....can you say Korea?...Care for LIVING children (CHIPS)....Insurance for LIVE Americans (Obama Care & Medicaid)....$uck off homeboy...
9997 2018-01-22 00:48:16 can't enforce a law unless you see someone actually littering; litter ends up on the streets and in the water sometimes even after we "properly" dispose of it; and why waste oil to make straws...for most people straws are not necessary.
9998 2018-01-22 00:48:02 i washed my hair and didnt put any coconut oil in it so naturally it's frizzy as fuck yikes

10000 2018-01-22 00:47:47 Half a pound of almond oil!
10001 2018-01-22 00:47:18 I make the grossest breakfast shakes adding raw eggs and almond butter, olive oil, all kinds of shit just bc the calorie count is high. Protein shakes are a must, I just “do a job” and down them daily.
10002 2018-01-22 00:46:53 Y’all have to stop using coconut oil for everything
10003 2018-01-22 00:46:50 I use coconut oil on my body & face right after i shower, while my skin still wet. I 've nvr broke out from it,  my skin is clear & soft & nvr oily, so
10004 2018-01-22 00:46:47 Or like shit like the bp oil spill where corporations value profits over 100+ human lives
10005 2018-01-22 00:46:24 would like to see crude around 62.7 to get long #oil #CL_F
10006 2018-01-22 00:46:21 coconut oil is trash. i’m sorry but it does nothing for me
10007 2018-01-22 00:46:14 i prefer almond oil to coconut tbh but they both amazing n i use both for hair and skin.
