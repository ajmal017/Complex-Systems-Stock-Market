Is one of the men secretly the Tin Man and she needs to oil him if he cries?

8 2018-12-17 23:58:34 I get your point, I too support the local shops and Costco is on the edge of town so it does not take away from locals. It’s good if you buy in bulk as many from the oil industry do in Aberdeen.
9 2018-12-17 23:58:29 I have spent my life agonizing. I saw solar panels go onto the White House with Carter... and come right off with Reagan. We knew about Climate Change in the 70s. I waited anxiously for my first electric car. Oil companies bought our gov out from under us. Fox spread their lies.
10 2018-12-17 23:58:16 @PnPCBC if Trudeau is going to cancel the arms deal with Saudi Arabia then we have to cancel the oil we ship in to this country. It all comes from the same country with the same values.
11 2018-12-17 23:58:14 Just gonna spend the night despairing about Climate Change and all the people in my province that think "ethical Canadian oil" will somehow cause less cataclysm than the bad people oil.

Never be shy or ashamed to support ur woman.

15 2018-12-17 23:57:52 Oil is down with the general market on growth fears. OPEC did their job and that's why oil has been steady for several weeks now. It's funny you pick up this argument only after the market tanked to bring oil down with it. You didn't think OPEC would cut.

2016-?: Russia launches an information war against the US to influence another country for their economic/power profit.

50s-70s: US-CIA orchestrated a coup in democratic Iran to prevent oil prices from rising, giving the Shah unlimited, oppressive power.

Parallels.

37 2018-12-17 23:57:33 Except 19 billion isnt a large deficit. 55 billion I'd say yes, like the one Harper ran. Actually 6 consecutive years of deficits under the conservatives. Look at how good they set us up for oil pipelines.

43 2018-12-17 23:56:50 Oil demand is going up. “Clean” energy powers less than 1.3%. We can work toward that but it’s not going to happen overnight. Where do you think the money comes from? Lol Tanking the economy means nothing for any sector. #Transmountain #CdnPoli #AbPoli

45 2018-12-17 23:56:16 I thought this was very sweet one of my students travel to Ecuador and she bought me this lovely essential oil gift.
46 2018-12-17 23:56:16 CBD oil helps mine
47 2018-12-17 23:56:12 i feel like an adult bc today i made my own dentist appointment and reset the thing telling me i needed an oil change (i got the oil changed too but i didn’t do that part)
48 2018-12-17 23:56:10 It is a mistake to apply logic to Trump, he’s probably stuck in the 80s mentality where lower oil is good for our economy and doesn’t realize how much of our economy revolves around it now.
49 2018-12-17 23:55:36 It’s nothing but a second Israel, stolen land taken by foreign refugees supported by empire. Israel too was sold as a multi-ethnic democratic socialist society at the start. You are supporting the starvation of Syrians and the theft of their oil, shame on you. @VanessaBeeley
50 2018-12-17 23:55:35 Well 1500 people fighting on themselves. It wasnt a political party it was the people of alberta fighting to not put in the new pipeline. How can anyone blame ottawa look in your own backyard. And if a remember right it was Harper who oil out oil companies
51 2018-12-17 23:55:34 Surely the presence of the USA in the Middle East since the end of WW2 is nto about Oil?

66 2018-12-17 23:53:45 So glad I didn't drink any MCT oil along with the magnesium I downed before leaving the house. I would have crapped my pants had I taken both at the same time.
67 2018-12-17 23:53:43 .America's crimes are by those in power, many of whom are naive or deluded! Its not deliberate but ignorant which is why you can help them if you understand its not their objective to oppress, they're told its not about oil or commerce they're told its about freedom! And it is -
68 2018-12-17 23:53:40 It's as accurate as saying this car doesn't require an oil change ever without saying it doesn't have an engine. He created a narrative without touching on the reasons why. He might as well say Ditka hasn't been to a bears game since the end of November.

73 2018-12-17 23:52:49 Also, I agree with Nenshi, “standing up for Canadian energy doesn’t mean we don’t believe in and care about climate change.”

“We can do both and that’s what people in the oil and gas sector do every single day.”

78 2018-12-17 23:52:20 I could live the rest of my life just eating veggies. I would be totally happy with that. Just as long as I have some olive oil, seasonings, and an oven. Roasted veggies are the shit

83 2018-12-17 23:51:30 Our tax money, billions of it, still goes to oil companies as an incentative even with being profitable and no longer start ups. What about tax cuts for wealthy? Thats our tax money wasted when it could be used for betterment of all American lives. Healthcare, living wage etc.

91 2018-12-17 23:50:23 i’m appreciative. i ran into a patient that goes to my job today at starbucks & they paid for my entire order which was a little over $7 . & then my nail lady gave me a body oil. i’m grateful , truly.

93 2018-12-17 23:50:08 I assume you're talking about Harper and the previous Conservative governments in Alberta, who capitualted to the U.S., closed refineries and didn't bother to consider diversification should Oil collapse?  Right Mike?

99 2018-12-17 23:49:12 I figured it out Mr. Wall! They do ship oil on the st Lawrence. The pipeline would go straight thru to n.b and that scares them they may lose business on the st Lawrence! They just use every other excuse so they can pretend its about green environment instead of green $$$$$$$$$$$
100 2018-12-17 23:49:07 Olive oil is a natural lubricant and therefore all the calories would slide right through, you're fine.
101 2018-12-17 23:48:43 Apparently its nothing but something that wants me to sign up for the military  and I really don’t like the idea of killing innocent people cause American wants oil
102 2018-12-17 23:48:39 This woman what are you doing with hot oil at this hour? 
103 2018-12-17 23:48:37 Scheer also fails to mention the massive boom from sky high oil prices. All of that was pissed away by the Cons. They also taxed real estate income trusts costing Canadians billions and leading to job losses. We  faired well because of strict lending policies, not the Cons.
104 2018-12-17 23:48:18 If we block oil they may cancel the arms deal.  Then they have to pay us cancellation penalties. AB/SK get pipelines, East gets cheap Oil, PM looks like genius, Brett becomes mayor, Libs and Conservatives hug, peace restored.   we all sing Oh Canada - original version.

106 2018-12-17 23:48:04 The East Coast has had to buy foreign oil for over 60 years because the "Trans Canada Pipeline" has never gone past Montreal. The goodwill to help Alberta got strained by "let the eastern bastards freeze in the dark", "eastern creeps & bums" politicians.
107 2018-12-17 23:48:01 Wars are fought on behalf of the FED. Sadam was our guy until he didn’t want to trade oil in the US petrol dollar. Heard Qaddafi also wanted to stop using it too. That got him disemboweled, to Hillary’s amusement.
108 2018-12-17 23:47:46 Since I guess I'm getting noticed:
In order to prevent palm oil deforestation, there has to be a supplemental alternative in food for low-income individuals. Paying people more is the ideal; stopping deforestation without sending people in poverty into bankruptcy is immediate.
109 2018-12-17 23:47:36 Because the United States is an oil company with the biggest military in the world. If we were to stop producing oil and wars, 90% of the population would have no job, including the “news” media.

111 2018-12-17 23:47:26 As usual, you just have to scroll up to see the things I mentioned.

Interesting that you are suggesting a black oil that WASN'T burned  as a source of fuel. How is it a fuel used by him if it wasnt used?

You could have just said there were no articles of clothing.

U.S. foreign policy actions, in the form of WAR CRIMES, are directed by MIC Death-Merchants who run Dept of State/Military.

But as he unlocked his door with his key, he was greeted with the burning smell of oil and chicken. 

Hearing Connor wincing in the kitchen, he threw aside his jacket almost immediately and darted over.

125 2018-12-17 23:45:28 She walked out, lol. I really hope the people get the Brexit they voted for and sovereignty over unelected leaders. Globalists stole our wealth and trained us to accept less and less, wars for oil, used to terrorism, while they sat inside their ivory towers. No more.
126 2018-12-17 23:45:18 It's pretty high alright. Ireland imports all its oil, most of its gas, and has two electricity inter connectors with the U.K. It might generate most of its actual electricity in Ireland, but most of the fuel is imported.

128 2018-12-17 23:44:53 Confidence he is out of touch with reality, economics 101 don't have defecits when the economy is good, wait until the oil bubble and the property bubble bursts. Of course it will not effect him he is rich, go get another job as a teacher and get the union protection.
129 2018-12-17 23:44:51 Trump approved #Oil companies to conduct seismic testing along the Atlantic #CoastLine & the effect on #WHALES & other #marinelife will be disastrous. Help us fight against all attempts by tRump to attack our coastlines, wild places, & vulnerable communities.

130 2018-12-17 23:44:50 Someone tweeted the other day , if the oil ran out we’d be independent within 24hrs
131 2018-12-17 23:44:49 CBD oil is phenomenal for treating anxiety.
132 2018-12-17 23:44:49 Through the oil royalties.   it ain't rocket science
133 2018-12-17 23:44:37 President Trump really doesn't care what others think. It's why he is very successful at making the U.S. economy the hottest in the world. He also now made the U.S. the No. 1 Oil producer. Why follow when you can lead ?
134 2018-12-17 23:44:28 Seen oil?

136 2018-12-17 23:44:16 And yet you can’t swing a dead cat without hitting three tweets about coconut oil, right? The only possible explanation is that aliens have cashed out their investments in agriculture and retired to someplace tropical.
137 2018-12-17 23:44:08 That’s why some of #yyccc, although supportive of Canada’s our oil & gas sector, aborted our participation in this noon-hour’s rally.
138 2018-12-17 23:44:04 it depends whether they're soaking in oil or not

140 2018-12-17 23:43:41 Friendly reminder that Trader Joe's sells a vitamin E oil for, like, $5 and it is what your skin is missing this winter. Buy it, use it on your face after you shower and before you go to sleep, and you will be a hydrated, glowing, better version of yourself. You're welcome.

143 2018-12-17 23:43:24 @GregABedard Do you do a Backes for Lucic/Matt Benning swap w/The Oil now? I think you have to.  It may just work.
144 2018-12-17 23:43:14 CBD Tip of the Day:
Marijuana and Hemp (Where CBD Oil is found) is NOT the same PLANT. They are cousins. 
 ...🖒
145 2018-12-17 23:43:13 ...house with oil and praying. Also very common. Praying in the “high places” (literally the highest physical places) in the city and believing they were “watchmen on the walls” was also big - praying about everything and “taking authority” over things they didn’t want to happen
146 2018-12-17 23:43:12 Inaccurate image, l don't see the dozens of gallons of oil behind Beto's seat.

149 2018-12-17 23:42:55 like cleaning up oil spills .
150 2018-12-17 23:42:55 It’s not every day I find myself googling “penis clip art” in the Valvoline oil change drive through, but I guess today is special
151 2018-12-17 23:42:55 Insiders continued to buy at some of the E&Ps through last Friday. The buyers had bought a few weeks earlier and were doubling down. Sizzle. That sends a strong signal. They're willing to dive in again. #oil #stocks
152 2018-12-17 23:42:47 Where oh where is my secret Santa  hiding. If I can’t repair my car engine by the new year I’m screwed thanks to @NTB and @Sedgwick who won’t take responsibility for damaging my timing chain during a routine oil change #SoSad
153 2018-12-17 23:42:45 I take Buspirone normally and it just takes the edge off anxiety. Even CBD oil has more of a euphoria to it which is barely noticeable.
154 2018-12-17 23:42:40 This Vietnamese green oil tho...  #Homepathicmeds
155 2018-12-17 23:42:37 I had my salad with oil and vinegar and almost gagged ughhhh
156 2018-12-17 23:42:32 you have to soak it with lots of water & conditioner & gel. but the gel has to be a good gel !! & oil if you got oils
157 2018-12-17 23:42:29 nature can be preserved while finding oil is possible it all depends on your time scale.
158 2018-12-17 23:42:13 I'm not sure.  Oil now with a DSI of 7.   The only thing lower than the SPX which is at 8.   Due a bounce.
159 2018-12-17 23:42:10 I am stuck at the mechanic for an oil change and all I want is for this day to be over... #sleepy #deadtired #drained
160 2018-12-17 23:42:07 i took my van in for an oil change... it’s 45 min.... i better come out and see a fucking bentley or some shit
161 2018-12-17 23:41:58 ? to all those watching the Stock Market. 7 rate hikes since our Potus took over in 2 yrs? 8th on the way? How many times were rates increased while President Obama was in office? There is no reason to Raise Interest Rates. Oil Prices Low, Dollar Strong. Economy Booming 
162 2018-12-17 23:41:57 There's still a tonne of stuff in the flat, we're here too, but things have been moved.

There was a delay this afternoon, maintenance couldn't sign off because the trickle vents have been superglued shut. Luckily, we're not on gas or oil, so it's not a desperate fix.
163 2018-12-17 23:41:50 Prob can’t get there. Nice cannabis oil. Amazing effects and no, not a purple dragon playing bass to be seen.
164 2018-12-17 23:41:48 Yes got that grade A organic beard oil ready LOLOL
165 2018-12-17 23:41:33 当たり前だよなあ？そうだよ(便乗)
166 2018-12-17 23:41:31 Is he selling stones or snake oil? What’s next? A Stoney Bear?
167 2018-12-17 23:41:14 The question is how long it will take for them to cut back on production..As it seems oil prices will go to zero way before these people cut back.
168 2018-12-17 23:41:08 bio oil 3 times a day
169 2018-12-17 23:41:06 into coconut oil now
170 2018-12-17 23:41:05 Took the vets chocs. Not Cadbury as it contains palm oil. And jelly babies lol. Gv my donations n hay and food too. And a big hug for marley most of all n a big smile to the vets n staff. Thy are such a grt team. So he's quiet. I keep checking him. And hopeing to sleep tonight. X
171 2018-12-17 23:41:05 Update: The EP is currently on hold.

I been burning the midnight oil tho in favor of a more personal project. I aint know the kid,  but his life affected mine somehow,  and essentially brought me back to the drawing board....with MORE BARZ. 

R. I. P XXXTENTACION
172 2018-12-17 23:41:05 Not Americans just Republicans. Seems they are much more supportive of Russians anyway. But Russia doesn’t want all their guns either. So perhaps that’s the wall we should build. They can have lots of guns, coal mines and oil derricks they want there.
173 2018-12-17 23:40:56 At least for me, all the calories in beer always stop at my gut & ass, even as the water passes thru. Olive oil can't be that bad.
174 2018-12-17 23:40:52 Or maybe parents should teach their children these things. My dad taught me how to do my taxes, change the oil & filter, change a flat. Mom taught us to balance a checkbook, the importance of cleaning the house, how to do laundry, & cooking. None of it was optional!
175 2018-12-17 23:40:32 この前炎龍堂に寄ったらテオさんがお茶出してくれて美味かったぜ～なんかモミアゲ長いねーちゃんがちょっと睨んでたけど(笑)
176 2018-12-17 23:40:31 Went to Midas for an oil change, 3 hrs later I’m still here due to a broken wheel stud (the rear half started spinning, guess it stripped out at the rotor hub?) UGGHHHHH....

178 2018-12-17 23:40:23 Universally good presents: a book you've never read before, a fancy covered version of a book you love, tins of biscuits, truffles, funky or fluffy socks, a good notebook, person relevant toiletries (their fab scent, beard oil), fragrances, a funny ornament, gift cards.
179 2018-12-17 23:40:14 This motor oil
180 2018-12-17 23:40:14 Does that mean we will see more women working in the mines, on the oil rigs, out in the bush - I doubt it
181 2018-12-17 23:40:11 泣いてなんかいないよ、これは心の油だ。
182 2018-12-17 23:40:10 @SearsAuto do you have any coupons for a discounted/ free oil change ?? 
183 2018-12-17 23:40:05 Sadly is all about money, they are founded by the oil gas people. They dont want Tesla to win, but Tesla already has. Go Elon!!! @elonmusk
184 2018-12-17 23:39:59 The algae produced three times the oil. The problem was the additive was expensive and it was too diluted in the algae growth raceway
185 2018-12-17 23:39:59 okay wait so i bought 

tea tree oil cleanser
tea tree oil toner 
vitamin e moisturizer 
vitamin e eye cream

186 2018-12-17 23:39:56 @NPR reports that offshore #windpower leases are selling for more than offshore #Oil leases. "Something's happening here, but you don't know what it is, do you Mr. #Trump." #climatechange #GreenNewDeal
187 2018-12-17 23:39:52 He's beautiful!!!
How old?
188 2018-12-17 23:39:52 Vicks vaporub, humidifier with eucalyptus oil in it, hot toddies, prescription strength cough medicine (tessalon perle is a favorite)
189 2018-12-17 23:39:17 OMG! They're making oil out of babies! 
190 2018-12-17 23:39:17 I had keto pizza made with copious amounts of olive oil and a glass of wine. 
The health authorities can piss off.
191 2018-12-17 23:39:17 This is the only way oil and gas can get in front of half the lawmakers on the Hill. They can also push other logical agenda items.
192 2018-12-17 23:39:17 And then you have competing for prices against other nation-states who not only subsidize their production but also actively campaign against our “dirty” oil. Yeah… it’s a very losing position for a gov trying to get those voters under a “progressive” banner.
193 2018-12-17 23:39:00 It didn't take clairvoyance to see the effects the #TaxScam would have on the future.
38% of Americans still buying the snake oil
194 2018-12-17 23:38:52 Whats ironic is that a drop in oil prices almost has very little impact to a lot of western countries. Especially the UK where taxation takes a big chunk. Whilst a rise is certainly felt.

196 2018-12-17 23:38:50 I'm operating under the assumption that the end goal of any oil industry support is a transitioned energy industry to cleantech. The oil industry will play a big role in achieving that dream, and it is not reflected here.
197 2018-12-17 23:38:45 Ugh. The stinky cook across the hall is frying in the old oil again. For Christmas, I'm buying her a big bottle of fresh peanut oil.
198 2018-12-17 23:38:43 My lil bf came to the house to meet my parents, my Daddy was like who yo ppl??  Made him check his windshield wipers, tires, oil etc....
199 2018-12-17 23:38:43 I don't think oregano, oil and pills should ever be in the same room
200 2018-12-17 23:38:24 My company sells oil on line 9 to Quebec. We get a bit higher price but not the world price.  Suncor says they are benefiting from cheaper Canadian oil in their Montreal refinery.  

QC would also get much cheaper natural gas by producing their own.
201 2018-12-17 23:38:05 Not when you buy your oil from foreign sources. Clean cheap energy allows you to tweet your little tweets at 100 watts per tweet ...u twip.
202 2018-12-17 23:37:54 That would create more land because it takes a lot of land and natural resources to kill almost 70 billion land animals every year. Then maybe tax carbon, stop fracking and using oil and focus on more renewable sources of energy.
203 2018-12-17 23:37:41 It's life OD on YouTube, they do all sorts of "can ___ be oil" videos.  Fun channel and they seem like some really knowledgeable guys.
204 2018-12-17 23:37:39 Most major US equities plummeted ahead of the FOMC meeting and a possible interest rate lift on Thursday. Oil markets nosedived as the idea of potential oversupply and global economic concerns informed investor thinking. @JonoChan_CMC
205 2018-12-17 23:37:37 Good grief. You’ve heard of a thing called royalties right? That’s money paid by oil companies to AB govt. you’ve heard of taxes right? That’s money we all pay to Ottawa, who send back some to provinces, but not all of it. And all of that is what pays for everything
206 2018-12-17 23:37:36 I'm from Illinois, I'm 25% corn oil
207 2018-12-17 23:37:35 Speedway is the most American gas station because you can fill the full-sized SUV up cheapest and get an oil drum of dr pepper for 89 cents at the same place
208 2018-12-17 23:37:34 good hardworking oh you mean = White people who drive trucks How come you arent protesting the Oil Companies that left your base high and dry?
209 2018-12-17 23:37:33 Tends to need a lot of maintenance and frequent oil changes...
210 2018-12-17 23:37:26 Oil everywhere!
211 2018-12-17 23:37:18 Somebody come take these braids out & oil my shits 
212 2018-12-17 23:37:10 #arthelp #findtheone #brushps Hello!! I'm looking for a good oil brush for photoshop! Did any one have somme suggestion?
213 2018-12-17 23:37:09 Oil of oregano....works wonders.
214 2018-12-17 23:37:04 I am a robot. I piss oil
215 2018-12-17 23:37:03 Nope. I don't need oil for my skin. I use bacon grease.
216 2018-12-17 23:36:56 If you had a clue about about oil and reserves and natural resources you'd understand why Bernie is "fear mongering" and why Trump is milking Saudi Arabia's oil. Work on that and come again.
217 2018-12-17 23:36:48 *He groans and falls to the side, metal peices scattered on the ground, oil and blood coming from his chest as he lies there on the ground* Y ...You dick
218 2018-12-17 23:36:47 It's easy: Provinces don't have to support the oil. They can 'vote their conscience', but then they do not get to benefit from it. No equalization payments. You can't have your cake and eat it too, as they say.

222 2018-12-17 23:36:22 @amazon now sells motor oil... 5wtf-30!
223 2018-12-17 23:36:16 Malin+Goetz perfume oil sounds unusual and great conversation starters.
224 2018-12-17 23:36:15 Vermicelli, peanut oil, and two avocado's please & thank you.
225 2018-12-17 23:36:14 You have to look at the countries of origin and how they compare with one another in terms of history, culture. Also how much money has been poured in to the European countries from oil rich Gulf states - again compare
226 2018-12-17 23:36:14 Is there a limit to the amount of fatty tissue my body can physically create in one day?

Like, theoretically 3500 excess calories is a pound of fat. But if I somehow drank 35000 calories of olive oil in one day, surely it would start passing through, right?
227 2018-12-17 23:36:14 Oil can!

232 2018-12-17 23:35:44 @simonahac Oil companies are better economic managers than governmens When crude is down, feedstock to their refineries and chemical plants is cheap. Drilling & construction is carried out when those industries are depressed, not when the price of crude is high.
233 2018-12-17 23:35:25 dont conservatives HATE governtment intervention into the market place? Now they WANT it? How come no one is picketing the Oil Companies that left them high and dry?
234 2018-12-17 23:35:19 Madeleine, it has always occurred to me that animals are not here for the convenience of humans , things. Like elephant tusks, rhino horn, tiger penis not to mention deforestation of the orangutan habitat for the greed of the palm oil industry. These are the ones I care about.

241 2018-12-17 23:34:05 hotteok tastes nicer if you let it set in the refrigerator for hours then fried it with a little amount of vegetable oil.
242 2018-12-17 23:34:03 Obama wanted to stop using oil... what a fruit cake!
243 2018-12-17 23:33:44 Heartbreak> being shot with oil from the pan.
244 2018-12-17 23:33:42 Park your car, walk, bike, turn down the heat, turn up the AC, tax oil & use money to do a Manhattan project to store wind, water & sun energy for later use. Geothermal, replant forests.
245 2018-12-17 23:33:36 It is the best oil yet!!!! I use it a few times daily and my skin has improved so much. Took away red spots and even lightened up my dark circles and no under eye puffiness. I love this oil!!!!!! Never, ever discontinue it please :)
246 2018-12-17 23:33:36 Don’t forget that Beto is actually a Big Oil guy. Not sure I can back that.
247 2018-12-17 23:33:35 Must’ve, oil pressure is low and drops to 0 every stop
248 2018-12-17 23:33:29 Why Oil prices are dropping in International Market ?

255 2018-12-17 23:32:54 A nice thing to do is toss a cut-up head of cauliflower with salt, pepper, oil, & cumin and roast it at 400* until it's really browned. Then drizzle with lime juice & more oil and add some cilantro.
256 2018-12-17 23:32:50 There's light sweet crude oil, so in addition to dinosaurs there had to have been dinosweets.
257 2018-12-17 23:32:29 - children separated from their parents at the border and put in detention centres 
- Opening up oil drilling in protected areas 
- gotten rid of water protection rules so companies can pollute the waters as their bank accounts see fit 
- pulled out of climate agreement
258 2018-12-17 23:32:26 China will have wrapped the globe in high-speed rail twice before you're getting a GO Train to Toronto on a Saturday.

But anyways lets go all-in on oil and see how our economy does in the 21st century.
259 2018-12-17 23:32:00 @NikkiPhillippi when I use an oil diffuser in my room, what is the best time to turn it on? Is it safe to have it on while sleeping ?

277 2018-12-17 23:29:49 Idk I guess sometimes it can be sore longer for ppl , but it’s only sore for like an hour after I just put coconut oil and it’s fine. I’ve never had any problems.

285 2018-12-17 23:29:02 Everything in oil is getting hammered. Someone is buying and I'd love to know what types of people are buying E&P names. I know MTDR has insiders buying almost daily.
286 2018-12-17 23:28:58 He’s had a plan, he’s talked about exactly what he’s going to do. pay attention. He’s going to challenge the equalization plan, he’s going to reduce both LNG & oil exports, he’s going to fight in Court & use whatever means necessary. Unlike @RachelNotley who’s lip service got zip
287 2018-12-17 23:28:51 3 of the 4 assets with the lowest DSIs are the #Nasdaq (10), S&P (8), and Oil (7). Someone you should tell Trump that you cannot have low oil prices and high stocks at the same time... High yield debt sees to that. #SPX

297 2018-12-17 23:27:47 It's thick and "creamy" because there's more rapeseed oil in it than oats.
298 2018-12-17 23:27:47 Who is “ they”? Even Rach has said that the demand for oil isn’t going anywhere soon.  This was merely some Albertans sounding off.  They get to do that

320 2018-12-17 23:24:42 I second the air-fryer. It's not big so it fits in a smaller kitchen. Cooks things quick with less oil. If you use a high smoke point oil like avocado, it won't smoke at all. I love it for brussels, reheating food, fries, wings. I'm always trying to cook things in it.

340 2018-12-17 23:22:23 You didn't give alternatives, you gave liberal wet dreams that they heavily subsidize and FAIL in grand fashion.  Oil is Canadas cash register, only a tool bag stupid kid would think otherwise.

357 2018-12-17 23:20:33 On the other hand

PMB increased foreign reserves from $29bn to $47bn by May 2018 now $43bn as at Dec 2018 = $14bn saved

Borrowed $12bn in the same period. So please if you deduct loans from savings:

APC has Positive $2bn while PDP has negative $34bn even with higher oil price
358 2018-12-17 23:20:28 How does someone not notice that 2 of their tyres are bald, its not something that happens overnight, you should regularly check oil, water, lights, tyres etc to make sure everything's working and legal.
359 2018-12-17 23:20:25 So we either reconfigure using high quality UK oils which are already much more expensive or continue to use olive oil which will be roughly the same price. It means our own prices will need to go up either way.
360 2018-12-17 23:19:23 ISIS (under protection of Erdogan) stole oil from Syria, then transported it to Turkey where the Turkish government sold it out of your ports into the open market. Money paid to ISIS (after Erdogan took his cut) to fund terrorism and MURDER.

366 2018-12-17 23:18:59 $57 key support on Brent Oil Spot. Of that fails expect lot lower. $45 to $40 ish good zone of Support and $50 important before that.
367 2018-12-17 23:18:48 I’d say it’s more of risk for Liverpool that’s why they haven’t spent as much due to the fact they’re not backed by oil money as if they don’t win anything this season klopp will be under scrutiny, but those buys were smart.

381 2018-12-17 23:17:03 Why lie?
External Debt as at when GEJ left was $10.32bn not $6bn. This $10bn loan was under GEJ alone because OBJ cleared debt

Foreign reserves depleted even under oil boom of over $100 pb from $53bn to $29bn May 2015 = $24bn. 

Add 24 + 10bn = $34bn wasted under PDP in 4 yrs
382 2018-12-17 23:16:59 g I thought oil change would be done a whole lot sooner so I haven't eaten anything yet
383 2018-12-17 23:16:50 Actually, it was designed to cripple the oil and gas industry.
384 2018-12-17 23:16:23 High USD definitely affects prices since oil is more expensive for other countries to buy. Therefore, hurting demand.

387 2018-12-17 23:15:47 on Zinke’s watch,the pass 4seniors for National Parks went from $10 to $80. Public lands( that belong to all of us) sold to large oil and gas companies. Cutting back the endangered species act. Big oil should not become director. It’s putting the fox in charge of the hen house

391 2018-12-17 23:15:10 @RyanZinke You turned Interior from a steward of public lands and natural resources into a front for the mining and oil and gas industries. So glad you've been forced to resign. Good riddin's to bad rubbish.

396 2018-12-17 23:14:40 It does good if you define “good” as “delays anything that would impair oil company quarterly earnings”. Gotta keep those earnings flowing, right Joe?
397 2018-12-17 23:14:35 But their the BBF of the US Christians. The US sells them loads of weapons and buys their oil and @realDonaldTrump says the prince did not kill the journalist bc he refuses to see the CIA report that states that the prince was involved. So it's all so inconsistently inconsistent!

411 2018-12-17 23:12:48 Canada imports 10m dollars a day of Saudi oil.  Quebec blocked energy east to prevent us from getting our own oil to refineries out east.   It's a fact, and AB is sick of paying out equalization to QB w zero return every year.

The two were soon lead to a small two chaired table. Right beside the long stretch of windows decorated with draping garlands for the holidays. A white table cloth neatly spread across the table with a small oil candle.

After thanking the hostess, Nick sat down with a sigh.

425 2018-12-17 23:11:20 Because it's 80% oil
426 2018-12-17 23:11:10 Sí quieren apoyar a la producción en vez de "mantener el precio del gas oil" tienen que bajarlos ¿O no se enteraron que el barril está bajando?
427 2018-12-17 23:10:51 You can review my comments. Sans exclamation marks. Hes quoting refinery data as if it was consumption data. One of the reasons is to inform Albertans that QCers don't consume Saudi "dictator" oil, when they do, as does Maritimes. Eastern decisions are based on price not origin.

429 2018-12-17 23:10:49 And shale is profitable at oil per barrel over about $40, and going down as tech improves.  Oil sands are not though. And Musk? Red herring. 1/2 what you say is a red herring I am finding.

What's wrong with the Rams is that Cooper Kupp is out, he's the oil that makes that engine run.

444 2018-12-17 23:09:14 He’s done more for Western Canada in 3 years than Harper did in 10, which might seem shocking, but not really, Harper had no interest in Manitoba, Alberta, Saskatchewan or BC, his interests were profits from Alberta Oil (but not Alberta) and crashing Ontario manufacturing.
445 2018-12-17 23:09:12 @realDonaldTrump If Congress won't give you the funds, identify our natural resources as in oil. Make a deal with oil companies. Use a % from oil revenues to help pay for pre-existing conditions, and fund the border wall. Of course, you need to give them something, tax credit?
446 2018-12-17 23:09:11 I thought I needed to rush but it was never enough and all I needed was some coconut oil

450 2018-12-17 23:08:46 You tell us, didn't your tantrums stop Alberta from getting oil to the coast?  Would rather import 10m dollars of oil every day from Saudi Arabia over boosting our own country?

452 2018-12-17 23:08:43 Yes, Completely dissatisfied service from On Shakti Motors, Moggapair West, Chennai. They charged me 4700₹ for service without engine oil. They didn't fix speedometer issue which I mentioned and they wrote it in Job sheet, The main issue was oil leak and it still leaks till date

456 2018-12-17 23:08:40 Yeah lol, we had people come to fix our furnace and the pipe they put on exploded off from pressure so the house started to flood with oil basically. It wasn’t ideal

460 2018-12-17 23:07:47 @jiffylube in EHT is the biggest scam going. I'm supposed to get 50% off since they didn't tighten my skid plate last time and it flew off while driving. Of course the file is not noted after speaking to the mgr. The girl next to me is being charged $110 for an oil change...wow
461 2018-12-17 23:07:45 I have to pack. Clean. Do laundry. Go shopping. Organize presents for kids. Clean my car. Get gas. Get an oil change & ALL I WANT TO DO IS HAVE MARGS AT CINCO

463 2018-12-17 23:07:39 Smoking is bad for the lungs. You can have it as tea, oil, biscuits, bread. It is soo kuch safer and better for the body than alcohol. Same rules for alcohol regulations can still apply. No driving for a limit. Not allowed at work or operating any machinery. Etc.

466 2018-12-17 23:07:25 I probably oiled my hair today for a good 30 mins deep conditioner and castor oil 
467 2018-12-17 23:07:12 I got a new oil & some Hawaiian Punch 
468 2018-12-17 23:07:12 So is coconut oil please don’t do that to yourself
469 2018-12-17 23:07:07 Same thing happens with me when I take my truck in for oil changes, they text to confirm booking, drop off, and completion. Every time I’m like oh who wants to talk to me lol
470 2018-12-17 23:07:04 that too is a False Narrative. QC has had enuf stories told about it that simply aren't true. like Saudi Oil Narrative QC gets 0% of its petroleum from Saudi's. Like most of Canada oil products come from the USA & that's probably AB oil.
471 2018-12-17 23:06:37 People feel good about themselves by using dirty oil, refusing to help the industry in their own Country and then making fun of the people that produce it and spend the profits.  Yep, some real assholes out there.
472 2018-12-17 23:06:34 Also I don't think oil and gas companies are "big bad" entities. The lack of oversight by the Tapcal Trust Fund PCs has directly lead to the current situation of poor asset base (savings, investments), low diversification success and captive politician status. Not fault of oil.
473 2018-12-17 23:06:28 @DoorDash hello I was very disappointed with the food I order from @CheckersRallys the fries looked like it was fried in old oil. Also my fish sandwich wasn’t looking to good either  my drink taste like water I know it wasn’t from the ice

482 2018-12-17 23:05:01 @johnmcdougallmd Why does your article "The Real Coconut Oil Miracle" not say something negative about it in the title or early in the article?
483 2018-12-17 23:04:48 Education has become financially unsustainable. The US needs to lead the world I'm future education or not! What will education look like in 50 years when oil reserves are gone?
484 2018-12-17 23:04:48 And to recall: in the 1950s the feds established the Ottawa Valley Line; west of the line, oil came from Alberta, east from wherever. The historical reason why Eastern Canada was originally dependent on Saudi oil.

487 2018-12-17 23:04:05 Had one of my favourite #DnD sessions tonight. It started with my adventurers escaping through tunnels, discouraging pursuers with a pool of burning oil, and ended with them felling a tree atop a hill in readiness to roll and flatten the same pursuers Wile E Coyote stylee.
488 2018-12-17 23:04:02 Is Trudeau a fundamentalist? Because he adopted the Conservative Party's carbon targets and love of oil pipelines.
489 2018-12-17 23:03:53 The best the 1% can offer. A clinical sociopath and narcissist. Protected by MSM and supported by big oil and the MIC. In those eyes he's a hero. Justice is a farce, for profiting  off the heard. A brave few broadcasters spoke up and paid the price. With Gratitude Thom...

504 2018-12-17 23:01:18 If you've been diagnosed with high cholesterol, you may need to change your diet. Foods that are rich in omega 3, like fish and olive oil, work wonders for reducing bad cholesterol. And, if you eat food rich in fiber, you'll see the benefits as well.

505 2018-12-17 23:01:17 I doubt that the industry pays for that much of our economy. We are paying for most of this stuff but we get told that the industry is paying for a ton of it. I'd like to see the money trail. The yearly reports of @YourAlberta don't seem to support this idea of big oil money.
506 2018-12-17 23:01:15 Humanity is fine it's capitalism that's wrecked,  it ignores the replacement cost of raw materials.  Oil needs 250k years of interest added to the price

525 2018-12-17 22:59:18 World oil price is so volatile that it will continue to flucuate aggresively next year. Why? OPEC no longer has the cloud to manage the price or output. World political and economic instability will also play a huge role in oil price. To maintain at US$60 is a huge task. #Oil
526 2018-12-17 22:59:09 Sweat, tears, and a shit ton of coal and oil ruining our atmosphere.
527 2018-12-17 22:59:07 1. If you still think crude oil is fossil fuel, it’s not. Think SHOCK absorption. The planet NEEDS it to stay right where it’s at!

542 2018-12-17 22:56:54 Not sure how good it would be to lose so many #jobs.  @JustinTrudeau should think instead of restricting or eliminating the import of #Saudi #oil and use Canada’s very own #Alberta oil.
543 2018-12-17 22:56:44 Most people in Quebec don't agree at all with Legault's comments. If they wished for a tree hugging communist agenda, QS would be in power. Trudeau's not interested by having an oil industry in Quebec because it would bolster our industries, he wants us to stay poor.
544 2018-12-17 22:56:41 I take hemp oil, and have for a couple of months now. I took it to reduce my spasticity in my right side because of my stroke. I haven’t noticed any benefit, but I know people who say it helped them deal with anxiety.

559 2018-12-17 22:55:17 it wont go for it and the fact the snp are gaslighting the vote shows them for the snake oil salesmen they really are...
560 2018-12-17 22:55:09 Olbas oil is my festive perfume this year 
561 2018-12-17 22:55:06 I think I've come up with a good trap for hipster hotties: put a carafe of pour over single-origin coffee, a bottle of beard oil & a piece of flannel on a sustainably designed wood table. Add sandalwood soap or candle as needed. If you don't hear from me before Jan 1, it worked.
562 2018-12-17 22:55:05 Was commenting on oil and not immigration, must have replied to wrong tweet
563 2018-12-17 22:54:56 Castor oil does wonders
564 2018-12-17 22:54:55 Thank God for @foxxcow because @pepboysauto tried to charge me $82 for an oil change. Probably because I’m a girl and they though they could get away with it. Called fox and he put a stop to that shit real fast. #thankful
565 2018-12-17 22:54:50 People that die in the oil pit only do so because they can’t handle the gay energy you receive from down there
566 2018-12-17 22:54:46 Patchouli oil
567 2018-12-17 22:54:44 Oil companies do that. Irving Oil specifically. Khadr got half of what you claim, because of previous govts failures to take care of a Canadian citizen.
568 2018-12-17 22:54:42 You can be proud, Joe, and realistic. The two are not mutually exclusive. You're willingly misleading people that there is a future in oil that looks like the past. It will look very different and most people will lose their jobs. Help them see the future.
569 2018-12-17 22:54:41 Robert Mercer’s RENTECH Medallion fund keeps micro trading, shorting, all trading secret using employee retirement account. RENTECH & Koch work together to protect oil. Koch spent $400M on midterms. Mercer spent $40M 2016 election + $22M on media co & election firm.
570 2018-12-17 22:54:28 Oil of Ulay
571 2018-12-17 22:54:28 My car needs oil so obviously ill wait until 10.55PM TO GET IT. Fucking losers round here.
572 2018-12-17 22:54:14 I'll take my pigment dispersed in linseed oil thank you
573 2018-12-17 22:54:12 Maybe the Oil and Pipelines companies could work directly with farmers for free land-access, in return for shares in the company
574 2018-12-17 22:54:08 If CANADA could get its oil to market outside just the U.S, it would make economic sense. Rachael knows that now, but it’s too late for her.
575 2018-12-17 22:54:06 Omg I just realized that’s motor oil 
576 2018-12-17 22:54:04 bacci
577 2018-12-17 22:54:03 Well it’d be pretty easy for you to go blonde then... I’d say do it! Love platinum blonde, my advice would be get some oil for your hair and put it on all the time if you do and get something like 3 minute miracle from aussie
578 2018-12-17 22:53:55 So maybe we should use a pipeline to get our oil to the great lakes, then use oil tankers to ship it passed Quebec and bypass them altogether.
579 2018-12-17 22:53:44 What I think the writer's missing is that people who want to shut down our energy industry just want it gone. They don't think about replacement of domestic oil and gas with foreign product. If they think about it at all, they expect renewables like solar and wind to replace O&G.
580 2018-12-17 22:53:41 Toast, with hemp oil, shelled hemp seed and an avocado slice and pinch of salt.
581 2018-12-17 22:53:33 Oil and Vinegar smokes too much dope.
582 2018-12-17 22:53:30 The next dude is just as bad. Oil lobbyists should not be allowed anywhere near that fucking office.
583 2018-12-17 22:53:21 Oil oil oil
584 2018-12-17 22:53:18 Today after I washed my hair I accidentally grabbed hair oil instead of detangler  lort help me  #allthedryshampoo #thankfulfordryshampoo
585 2018-12-17 22:53:08 Started taking CBD oil the past couple of nights to battle some recent insomnia, seems to be helping so far.....
586 2018-12-17 22:53:02 2019 I’ll be focusing all of my artistic energy towards graphite work & oil painting.
587 2018-12-17 22:52:58 Canada's problem is Trudeau. It's because of Trudeau's policies that our economy will crash and burn. Investments are leaving Canada at an alarming rate. Our oil is being traded for a much lower price than what world oil is traded for. Over a hundred thousand jobs have been lost
588 2018-12-17 22:52:57 Because Trump is Putin’s useful idiot and can gin up a bigger market for Russian oil exploration in the Arctic after the ice melts.. (and the rest of the planet burns?
589 2018-12-17 22:52:51 CBD oil is a miracle worker
590 2018-12-17 22:52:47 *knocking politely on Beat’s door* do you have any truffle oil and Cheerwine I could borrow 

“but of course”
591 2018-12-17 22:52:39 Juul’s...but like for THC oil.
592 2018-12-17 22:52:36 People, until they find "clean" oil, stop working, driving, heating your homes and shun everything "dirty" oil. Who needs paved roads built on dirty oil by products?  Why did it take us so long to see this obvious wisdom. Damn.
593 2018-12-17 22:52:32 good bc my hair is an actual oil slick
594 2018-12-17 22:52:24 Could it be that you have rapidly ballooned the federal deficit, destabilized trade, suck value out of the stock market and the snake oil charms of that ridiculous tax cut  are wearing off!  The Fed knows what we all know, your a con man with no real economic plan!
595 2018-12-17 22:52:12 Why do you assume that unemployment is the only mechanism to cool inflation, Doug? I would think that with the right labor market institutions, other mechanisms are possible (wage restraint, price controls, improved resource use, technological substitution for oil, etc.)
596 2018-12-17 22:52:12 Tar sands oil is full of carcinogens, that why they won't refine it in Canada.
597 2018-12-17 22:52:11 Wait
Plz
598 2018-12-17 22:52:10 Is there a real chance we could separate? If I talk to anyone that isn’t directly working for the oil industry and they are barely aware let alone understand the depth of the mess CANADA is in with Trudeau.
599 2018-12-17 22:52:08 It is my personal opinion that a healthy life requires constant thoughts of Marge Simpson
600 2018-12-17 22:52:08 Baby oil will help those engines.
601 2018-12-17 22:52:05 OIL OF EVERY PEARL'S UN-SIDES
602 2018-12-17 22:52:03 Yeah, tea tree oil has some mild antiseptic properties, but it's not going to clear up mrsa
603 2018-12-17 22:51:46 No I think he's trying to say that they use motor oil since it doesn't get absorbed into pancakes (It's an advertisement thing)
604 2018-12-17 22:51:44 So what are the options? You have old NG and oil generation you want to get rid of in the next 5 years and you have a limited budget...….I'll wait for your answer.
605 2018-12-17 22:51:36 So nobody’s spending this Xmas either online or in the high street.... well fuck me maybe it’s because nobody’s got any money, foods up, fuels up, bills up, wages ain’t crude oil lowest for ages still not seen at pumps costs me £15 extra a week just that
606 2018-12-17 22:51:22 I wish he would get a oil change for his hair.
607 2018-12-17 22:51:19 Just got my oil changed & the guys working there told me I look like a young girl Beetlejuice but also kind of like a lion & now that I’ve received the highest compliments I’m sure to receive today I guess I’m gonna go back to bed
608 2018-12-17 22:51:17 Well it was idiotic to speak French when Quebec laughs at us because we send them billions $ and they cut off our pipelines and use Saudia Arabian oil and gas!
609 2018-12-17 22:51:10 Just a little trick I discovered a while back.  If you put on baby oil right after the shower, and then the baby lotion after it's soaked in,  you will not only smelled great but have baby soft skin.
610 2018-12-17 22:51:07 Only essential oil I use for anything remotely medicinal is a couple dabs of peppermint oil when I have a bad migraine. It loosens the sinuses. But it still ain't a substitute for Tylenol or whathaveyou.

612 2018-12-17 22:51:05 Why do you support importing Saudi blood oil into quebec ports and not support Canadian oil?
613 2018-12-17 22:50:49 also I’m no mechanic but I’m not sure she’s putting oil in her car correctly 
614 2018-12-17 22:50:47 Like Chelski had one before it got bought with oil money 
615 2018-12-17 22:50:46 デカレン放送当時高校生。いつもSPライセンスを持ち歩いてたのを思い出した。RT

617 2018-12-17 22:50:38 Why do you support importing Saudi blood oil into quebec ports and not support Canadian oil?

619 2018-12-17 22:50:28 If you're near then Hope CBD have an office at Hamiltons ground. Creams, oil and sweets. All good stuff. Got some to help my mums arthritis, gave her some relief.
620 2018-12-17 22:50:26 Bissalaaaaam
621 2018-12-17 22:50:23 Make Village soup - Google the recipe

Or

Slice into 3cm chunks, sauté in olive oil (with plenty of seasoning), when they are just about cooked, big dollop of craime fraiche, swirl around and slide into a dish, few breadcrumbs and a little parmesan.  Hot oven until brown

623 2018-12-17 22:50:16 The one I have means that I can only smell a few things: garlic, tikka kebabs and olbas oil.
I have never been so jealous of the scent of pizza before 
Did you get some?
624 2018-12-17 22:50:13 They really are omfg like tea tree oil is powerful on its own but combined??? amazing!
625 2018-12-17 22:50:13 Spike at the pump is coming...and we Alaskans pay a national high in the oil rich arctic state we live in. Were screwed!
626 2018-12-17 22:50:11 Says who? You obviously are out of touch with what’s really going on and the 130,000+ lost jobs. And it should be about how CANADA is doing. Alberta oil to the right markets will generate 28 billion in additional revenue for the country. Everyone could be doing better.
627 2018-12-17 22:50:02 As a plus, he exactly fits my mental image of an oil lobbyist.
628 2018-12-17 22:50:02 Oil-field services firm #BakerHughes on Friday reported a fall in the U.S. oil-rig count by 4 to 873 (its lowest since mid-October), reflecting pressure on shale oil prices, which have been trading below $45 a barrel since late Nov #MarketWatch

632 2018-12-17 22:49:36 The need for alternatives is accepted by most everybody, including people who support oil & gas industry.
I simply won't accept the idea that oil & gas is our enemy and needs to be shut down immediately as spouted by anyone who currently relies on it.
The epitome of hypocrisy.
633 2018-12-17 22:49:27 I got new brakes yesterday, new tires, an oil change, and an inspection today and not 2 miles after I pass my inspection my check engine light came on

635 2018-12-17 22:49:20 Tweeting again to correct typo: A coalition of environmental groups including the Center for Biological Diversity, Earthjustice and Friends of the Earth has just sued to halt the Liberty Project, which would be the first oil production facility in Arctic Federal Waters.
636 2018-12-17 22:49:13 @Ocasio2018 Insurance wants to keep its health insurance profits.  Big oil wants its subsidies and free military protection.  Contractors want sales.  And they all love the huge tax cuts.  Look around:  Amazon, Google, Goldman, Lockheed, Exxon etc.  Veterans always lose.
637 2018-12-17 22:49:08 Also oil and gas creates more chances for employment as compared to wind turbines. But I guess it’s ok to throw jobs away.

あとでYoutubeの方みる（笑）
642 2018-12-17 22:48:19 So import Saudi oil because Trudeau doesn't want energy east ? I guess Khadr getting 20.5 million for killing Spears is ok ?
643 2018-12-17 22:48:17 Just tried CBD oil for the first time for my anxiety. Pleasantly surprised at how hell it was able to mellow me out today. Really hoping it works as well tomorrow during work where my anxiety usually gets triggered to an all time high.
644 2018-12-17 22:48:15 I just made the tahini myself! since it's just sesame seeds and vegetable oil, i just whipped it up last night and let it set while the chickpeas hydrated

646 2018-12-17 22:48:05 Brett Wilson:
That guy thinks differently than me, hang em! 

That guy doesn’t like oil? Death! 

That guy doesn’t like me wanting to kill everyone? What an asshole!

Jason Kenney:
I like this dude, let’s make him our mascot!
647 2018-12-17 22:47:55 So the Saudi's and China just signed multiple agreements for Saudi to feed China's insatiable thirst for  oil. I thought their, China's, economy was tanking. Wait a minute, something seems a bit odd about this. Stealing your wealth a trillion at a time, how rude. Just saying.
648 2018-12-17 22:47:50 6mins of boiling, then drain and place in the tray with oil & herbs. So simple but tasty!
649 2018-12-17 22:47:45 Quick, natural hair twitter, what the best type of oil to use
650 2018-12-17 22:47:43 Short, short-term, but the risk/reward is clearly skewed to the upside once Oil bottoms here in the next few months. I focus on the big picture.
651 2018-12-17 22:47:43 This is about black gold, plain and simple. Our so-called "representatives" are so afraid of retaliatory price increases on crude oil that they see the bloodshed of the innocent as a fair trade. Sure, an embargo would suck, but fuck, it's not the end of the world!
652 2018-12-17 22:47:36 The Dow Jones is down again as are oil prices. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't gas prices crash right along with the economy?
653 2018-12-17 22:47:20 I drink milk until I cough up milk
654 2018-12-17 22:47:19 Izzy said she’d down a litre of oil for £20 if she needed it
655 2018-12-17 22:47:18 @brentdougherty when you asked @MickeyRyan1045 who was going to oil him up for the flex off. I thought I heard @DawnDavenportTN vomit. I was waiting for a I just through up in my mouth from Dawn. Instead she just LOL for real. Great show. Best 4 hours in the radio
656 2018-12-17 22:47:15 America has something like the "resource curse," like a Russia or Nigeria for oil, but instead with devoting 20% of its GDP to parasitic health care interests: the "private health care curse."
657 2018-12-17 22:47:03 That happened to me but with hair oil OMG IT WAS EVERYWHERE EVERYTHING WAS SLIPPERY AF
658 2018-12-17 22:46:51 Aye bruh @Chrysler I wish I had traded in my car earlier. @Honda got a cafe set up for ya boi, and even washing my car for free after my oil change... that I was able to schedule over the weekend on their app!
659 2018-12-17 22:46:49 Getting your car serviced is such a fucking scam I just dropped $100 getting an OIL CHANGE that literally took like 10 mins???
660 2018-12-17 22:46:44 I was without a doubt the loudest fan in Lucas Oil Stadium this past Sunday, send them my way so I can bring that energy again!! #ColtsNation
661 2018-12-17 22:46:40 You guys should look into making your own mayo. Most of this Crap in stores is mostly Soybean oil which is complete trash,
662 2018-12-17 22:46:38 @JacksonGalaxy where can I get cbd oil for my cat
663 2018-12-17 22:46:38 I had kale in tin foil over a grill a few weeks ago.  It was seasoned with olive oil, lemon juice, salt.  Was actually amazing.
664 2018-12-17 22:46:35 My piercing bump is finally healed I would like to thank tea tree oil and sea salt
665 2018-12-17 22:46:29 y'all think simply extracting Earth's resources is hellish? let me introduce you to my friend, The Supply Chain

*monstrous, decaying ouroboros composed of concrete, oil, and mangled wildlife writhes into view from stage right, screams*
666 2018-12-17 22:46:18 God blesses the people who is with Israel.. and God destroys the people who try to destroy Israel... it’s in the Bible
America always on Israel side & became rich, then against Israel and poverty came upon, now going up
Saudi Arabia OIL is dried up, America now has oil
667 2018-12-17 22:46:12 well, now you live under Western Occupation. The US has taken the 30% of Syria east of the euphrates with most of Syria's water oil and gas. They have well established military bases and airfields. Have fun living under tyranny chum.....p
668 2018-12-17 22:46:09 Umm, Senator...you know thats actually motor oil, right?
669 2018-12-17 22:45:50 Lol....listen to drunk women on trains!! 
Put sausages in oven for 15 mins with 1 tbsp oil.
Then...very important....mix flour and eggs into paste type mix....then add in milk in small amounts.  Put in with sausages for 30 mins.
It actually rose....like Jesus at Easter!!!!! 
670 2018-12-17 22:45:44 Seems to be a double standard. Assuming a guy if gay due to fashion is compliment but if women are asked if is because they are either childless or dress too comfortable like flannel or able to change own oil in car etc. Nope I need Wal-Mart for that. LOl  family is worse .
671 2018-12-17 22:45:37 Those were expansions of existing lines, non of which mattered as the ones currently at issue. This rally has zero to with oil, pipelines or people. This is nothing more than a hyper partisan political stunt for a power grab.
672 2018-12-17 22:45:35 "I moved on Iraq like a bitch. You know, I'm automatically attracted to oil. I just start bombing them. It's like a magnet. Just bomb. I don't even wait for Congress. And when you're president, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab em by the fake WMDs."
673 2018-12-17 22:45:33 new brakes and oil change on both cars...I’m done adulting for the day
674 2018-12-17 22:45:26 Hahahahahaha sana oil
675 2018-12-17 22:45:20 Bruhh no cap i also broke my oil cart today and thought bout you like damn this sucks
676 2018-12-17 22:45:20 Cutting off Saudis from sending Canadians billions for trucks they can buy from other areas of the world is NOT punishment.  Cutting off Saudi Oil is actual punishment.
677 2018-12-17 22:45:18 Get rid of “insurance” and that will bring the prices down. Insurance should only be for catastrophic events, like, well, insurance. You don’t use car insurance for oil changes: you don’t use home insurance (another racket) to perform maintenance. 

Health insurance is overused.
678 2018-12-17 22:45:17 did a large cross-continental trip in the mid-00ghts with one of these.
it sips a lot of oil, keep it well fed.
Also make sue the oil filter is in a good state, or change it, ditto the oil pump.

you may also need to change piston Rings if the previous owner wasnt taking care..
679 2018-12-17 22:45:11 I cut ties with a longtime friend because she and some rando were literally doing a medicine show routine on Facebook where one would complain of some malady and the other would chime in with the *perfect* oil to "cure" it
680 2018-12-17 22:45:00 If I offered you $25 off CBD Oil
would you try it?
Yes or No
Still have a few left
681 2018-12-17 22:44:59 #Commodities 17/12/2018
Oil$49.16-1.44%
Gas$3.56+1.05%
Gold$1,249.70-0.17%
Silver$14.74-0.13%
Corn$383.50-0.13%
682 2018-12-17 22:44:58 Agreed. But until there is a viable alternative that can support the 1st world way of life everyone so enjoys, oils cannot be phased out at this time. Oil goes beyond production of fuel. It’s in the majority of everything in our lives. Shutting it down isn’t a solution.
683 2018-12-17 22:44:55 I hope we didn’t make them mad at us!  We need low cost oil.
684 2018-12-17 22:44:55 Yeah he definitely took care of that.  Probably always changed the oil on time and runs great.
685 2018-12-17 22:44:39 Coasting almost (actually nowhere near) as much as the oil and drug wars that displaced the refugees in the first place right?
686 2018-12-17 22:44:38 Oil going lower, so CAD too ST. "Symbiotic".
687 2018-12-17 22:44:33 Egg yolk, honey and olive oil spot treatment/mask. All stuff you probably have  around.
688 2018-12-17 22:44:33 One of my employees got me an essential oil defuser for secret Santa and I am so in love!!!
689 2018-12-17 22:44:31 @JustinTrudeau Block Saudi OIL   what is wrong with you  .Cutting arms deal now ?  More Jobs done the toilet   HARPER was right your to YOUNG
690 2018-12-17 22:44:28 #Oil drops, with U.S. prices below $50 to mark their lowest settlement in over a year!!!
691 2018-12-17 22:44:23 I’ve been really looking after my skin the last few weeks but the only moisturiser I can tolerate and that doesn’t sting is coconut oil.

695 2018-12-17 22:44:09 Keep on him Vivian! You are uncovering shocking truths about the foreign-funded campaign to shut down Alberta’s oil sands...thank you for your hard work and the courage to share the truth!
696 2018-12-17 22:44:04 Why do you support importing Saudi blood oil into quebec ports and not support Canadian oil?
697 2018-12-17 22:43:59 The Chinese population though large is weak and unhealthy. The way you beat Russia is by sitting back and tanking oil prices
698 2018-12-17 22:43:55 Why do you support importing Saudi blood oil into quebec ports and not support Canadian oil?
699 2018-12-17 22:43:44 omg this is too kind!! I honestly have been working here just a few months but the online CBD oil community has been amazing! Vanessa is honestly the nicest and an excellent example of someone who went from knowing very little about CBD to so much just by being open minded! 
700 2018-12-17 22:43:44 Oh sure if you enjoy the smell, fine. For first aid? No. Trying to get your friends to buy your snake oil? Not cool.
701 2018-12-17 22:43:40 Interesting thought. China has way more steel production.  Oil production is Russia (and that's the most important).  US still has more oil production than China.
702 2018-12-17 22:43:33 Kasich: "Climate change is a real issue, but the extent is unproven." (Aug 2015) "We should open more federal lands to oil and natural gas exploration." (Oct 2015). I'm so utterly disappointed in you, Ed.
703 2018-12-17 22:43:32 Why do you support importing Saudi blood oil into quebec ports and not support Canadian oil?
704 2018-12-17 22:43:27 I got to call bullshit on this picture these guys with full beards but work in oil and gas lol don’t think those beards are Scott air pack approved
705 2018-12-17 22:43:13 Last thing lol, emollient castor oil works amazing as a sealant.
706 2018-12-17 22:43:11 Actually crying cause the smell of oil is making me nauseas asf
707 2018-12-17 22:43:06 Why do you support importing Saudi blood oil into quebec ports and not support Canadian oil?
708 2018-12-17 22:43:03 If you don’t feel oppressed by the healthcare system, our tax system, our voting system, our food suppliers, big oil, big pharma, propaganda, the cancer industry, etc... you’re either uneducated and need to be informed or you’re too conditioned to give a fuck. Fix yourself
709 2018-12-17 22:43:03 Oil of every pearl's un insides
710 2018-12-17 22:42:50 Yes. The highest quality could really help him. CBD oil is legal nationally. It doesn’t contain THC, which is what causes the high. Look into Rick Simpson Oil, too. Ps-I ONLY know this because I had to study it. 
711 2018-12-17 22:42:46 #Toothache sucks. Clove oil works briefly but tastes like raw material.  Brick maybe?

713 2018-12-17 22:42:22 My objection was to the claim that theres no oil other than Canadian & USA oil in QC. The graph suggested ALG, Mid Eastern, & VEN oil wasn't being consumed anymore. But the consumption story is more complex than refining. Also Energy East solves nothing because of cheap SA price.
714 2018-12-17 22:42:17 @JaeRichards @Trey_Richards Send help, mans need some good beard oil recommendations.
715 2018-12-17 22:42:13 Hell, they both let Quebeckers dump tonnes of ACTUAL shit into the River already, what's little oil going to do?
716 2018-12-17 22:42:12 FFS what is wrong with people.   Had a guy I worked with bagging a woman on TV - I said have you had a look in the mirror?  You are no oil painting mate and until you improve don't criticize her or any woman. People are just dickheads.
717 2018-12-17 22:42:06 War on oil continues as American's learn Federal Reserve/US Treasury is willing to throw stock & oil investors under the bus to save the currency.
718 2018-12-17 22:41:57 Come on Cheryl on #ukog LSE
..........Long sigh....
719 2018-12-17 22:41:56 < heating up some oil in probably the only pan she owns in the shack. {And I think it ain't fair for you to take full responsibility for whatever is gon' happen.} Misty carefully pours in some of the pancake batter, watching is spread over >
720 2018-12-17 22:41:49 Thanks Brad for pointing that out.  M probably doesn’t realize today we can’t buy oil, fertilizer or anything from a country like Iran.  But M doesn’t understand international trade.  Thanks again!!!
721 2018-12-17 22:41:45 I guess handouts are only good for Trump’s buddies and farmers. And our economy is about to tank. Snake oil for Christmas.
722 2018-12-17 22:41:38 Just dipped my finger in fucking oil making vegan latkes if these don’t taste good and i burnt the fck out of my finger Ima be real fuckin pissed
723 2018-12-17 22:41:32 I think I got my oil changed there once
724 2018-12-17 22:41:24 CAD will cream all other DM currencies when Oil soars to triple digits again in the next 12-24 months, below par again vs USD. Yup, that's what makes a market 
725 2018-12-17 22:41:19 Oil and water
726 2018-12-17 22:41:17 Put one extra drop of coconut oil in your hair and now It looks like you haven’t washed It in a week 
727 2018-12-17 22:41:13 I'm new parents who thinks it's you can they redesigned it will look as I bet the oil and I'm https.
728 2018-12-17 22:41:10 God blesses the people who is with Israel.. and God destroys the people who try to destroy Israel... it’s in the Bible
America always on Israel side & became rich, then against Israel and poverty came upon, now going up
Saudi Arabia OIL is dried up, America now has oil
729 2018-12-17 22:41:00 500ml hot water, 3 caps full of powdered lube, a big dollop of aqueous cream, 3 drops of clove oil and 3 drops of eucalyptus oil. Blend it all up in a blender, transfer back to the jug, microwave for 30 seconds, stir, repeat 2/3 times and voila! 
730 2018-12-17 22:41:00 Those were old NG plants. The new NGCC plants are really clean and have no smell. My old company is building them all over Florida.....replacing old NG and oil burners.
731 2018-12-17 22:40:41 it’s national maple syrup day... get your motor oil ready!
732 2018-12-17 22:40:20 นอนไม่เคยหลับ กว่าจะผ่านไปได้ในแต่ละวัน เตรียมตัวทำงานเช้า สภาพไม่เคยเต็มร้อย ขอเวลาอีกหน่อยนะ

734 2018-12-17 22:40:05 "individuals into driving, that subordinates all other modes of transport and ways
of dwelling, that requires enormous state subsidy and regimentation
of urban space for maximum throughput and speed, and requires a centralized state-backed capitalist oligopoly of oil, highway,"
735 2018-12-17 22:39:51 So your beliefs before you were elected you hate oil. Glad you cleared that up.
736 2018-12-17 22:39:36 
737 2018-12-17 22:39:21 The oilfield was invaded last week...Maybe they had some oil in storage and were able to delay the force majeure up to today.
738 2018-12-17 22:39:07 The OPEC/non-OPEC decision of December 7 to reduce supply by 1.2M bpd (starting Jan 1) has moderated the projected surplus in global oil supply for 2019. However, it has failed to produce a rally in #crude prices this month.
739 2018-12-17 22:39:01 Hot oil just splashed on me. Shey I won’t cry?
740 2018-12-17 22:38:50 Bro if I knew my oil changes was going to cost $50 I would of never got the car I did  tbh
741 2018-12-17 22:38:29 I did coconut oil once but I like the saltiness of the butter.  Either works just the same though 
742 2018-12-17 22:38:28 Nah g you’re the one who works in the oil industry g baller
743 2018-12-17 22:38:26 Actually motor oil is the doctor, not the monster.
744 2018-12-17 22:38:09 My largest position is $FB n +4.3% on it

This has kept me float in this selloff

Oil hurting but sizing is ok

Ok enough to enjoy the fun n games
745 2018-12-17 22:38:02 Thank you  the only tip I have is blow dry your hair so it’s stretched. I’ve tried to do my hair numerous times on wet hair & it just doesn’t work. 

Holding product was ORS Olive Oil pudding
746 2018-12-17 22:38:02 Yes let’s stop importing Saudi oil into Canada!
747 2018-12-17 22:37:55 Oh my would my kid just go.bonkers to get a  @Jones4Caleb right from him.
748 2018-12-17 22:37:55 The net length held by hedge funds and other major speculators — a proxy for their bullish bets on oil; price — at 21.10M bbls, the lowest since Jan 2016. It compares with an all-time high of 485.14M bbls in net length in April 2016.
749 2018-12-17 22:37:53 I wouldn't know... as the oil man never cameth.
750 2018-12-17 22:37:33 My view, as quite often on these matters, is there are plenty of know nothing Billy bullshitters on both sides of the argument but as we know, the squeaky wheel gets all the oil
751 2018-12-17 22:37:32 i forgot the CBD gummies i use for anxiety at home, so my mom gave me some of her hemp oil (cool). what i don’t know is why i was surprised when it smelled exactly like weed??? 
did this surprise anyone else
752 2018-12-17 22:37:10 They gonna run when next they see oil and car 
753 2018-12-17 22:37:05 More oil on your head sir and may the lord continue to uplift and strengthen you and ur family now and always. Amen
754 2018-12-17 22:37:03 “Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord” James 5:18
755 2018-12-17 22:36:43 I know he uses a lot of oil in his cooking but this seems excessive
756 2018-12-17 22:36:40 You need to look at the chart? You can see what’s happened over the past few years. More Than 50% of Quebec oil now comes from Alberta! You took comments out of context to whatever reason!
757 2018-12-17 22:36:33 Of course not. But facing competitive pressure at the pumps where every supplier but them can claim "NO KILLER REGIME OIL!" would do the trick.
758 2018-12-17 22:36:32 @timandsid Which is going down faster?  The @EdmontonOilers or their oil industry?  #ouch
759 2018-12-17 22:36:22 Libya's NOC Declares Force Majeure On Sharara Oil Fields Ops.
760 2018-12-17 22:36:14 I know that.  A for runner of the West Ham model.  What happens when oil runs out?
761 2018-12-17 22:36:07 How would capitalism have preventented this inflation? They were a production Economy based on oil. Oil prices fall, their money becomes worthless. They have no other exports. It has more to do with supply and demand, than socialism. We are a consumer economy. Wait for it...
762 2018-12-17 22:35:56 Castor oil got my hair thick nshit. I putting it in braids so it can grow even more !!!!
763 2018-12-17 22:35:55 In the winter I will prep my skin with a misting spray, pat it in, and then seal with moisturizer and then a facial oil. Right now I use a homemade spray of rosewater, purified water, almond oil and vegetable glycerin.

765 2018-12-17 22:35:41 It depends... 20$ oil in line with strong DXY will raise oil prices in local currencies to infinity. You can have deflationary move in US, but big inflation will be exported outside US.
766 2018-12-17 22:35:24 Huuuummmm, does media ever shows that? Does UN do anything about it? Is stealing and killing innocent people to get FREE oil ok?????
767 2018-12-17 22:35:13 put that oil in my mouth, clean water is for uhhhhh loosers
768 2018-12-17 22:35:11 The US is currently bombing Syria. And the migration in to Europe is mostly from East African countries where the US is currently deployed to protect its oil companies. Or where the US facilitated a coup in Sudan and split the country for oil. Yours are of your own making.
769 2018-12-17 22:35:07 Na yafe wllh
770 2018-12-17 22:35:04 I really appreciat sir
771 2018-12-17 22:34:59 Oil sands production was becoming more expensive and less attractive for investment. "Increasing shareholder value" means they would have left no matter what. Shareholders in these companies aren't loyal to anyone except their dollars.

776 2018-12-17 22:34:38 Have wars been about protecting women? This whole time I thought they had been about protecting rights, land, oil, property, money, or ability to own slaves...
777 2018-12-17 22:34:32 I actually forgot John Rambo did a tour in Afghanistan.  Was that the Northern Alliance he was hanging with?  Looks like he's doing recon for locations to build oil pipelines. #itv4 @milton_mick
778 2018-12-17 22:34:28 How about their use of palm oil which leads to deforestation?
779 2018-12-17 22:34:19 Rose oil / anointed rose oil
780 2018-12-17 22:34:12 People buy olive oil, but it's really canola oil because we don't read a lot here. Movies, television, and music tells us who we are here. People want to call me crazy because they don't know any better. Stay there, but back the hell up off of me. The price of freedom is high.
781 2018-12-17 22:34:09 A pipe from our furnace today exploded...  the entire house smells like oil.  
782 2018-12-17 22:33:59 The sticky chicken skewers are absolute totes amazeballs!!  was so pleased to see the No Palm Oil symbol on box.. well done #Iceland they’re also @SlimmingWorld friendly at 1 syn each #evenbetter #yummy #nopalmoilchristmas #win

785 2018-12-17 22:33:43 It’s sad for the citizens that bought into this what 20 years ago? How does an oil producing country loose everything?
786 2018-12-17 22:33:35 Are you using CBD oil alone or CBD full-spectrum oils?
787 2018-12-17 22:33:32 @Richzeoli Michael Cohen is going to learn how to slice the garlic so thin that it liquifies in the pan with just a little oil.
788 2018-12-17 22:33:19 Wash your hands with Dial Soap.  If that doesn’t do it try some baking soda and water. I just had this graphic in my head of an onion dripping oil.  Sorry.
789 2018-12-17 22:33:12 In what way does getting behind Trudeau adopting Harper's carbon targets, buying oil pipelines, adopting Harper's corp tax rate, continuing the Cons' Saudi deal to defeat Scheer make sense? Getting behind those Liberal party policies doesn't defeat him - they embody him.
790 2018-12-17 22:33:07 D current financial probs in d Naija Oil sector are directly traceable to Diezani.Her corrupt practices deprived d Naija treasury of a staggering estimated figure of $100bn!It's a baffling mystery y she's allowed to quietly hide in London a free bird under d pretext of an illness
791 2018-12-17 22:33:03 Oil and gas industry accounts for 7.6% of US economy versa 12.6% of Russian. But US is 100% almost Chinese shoe outlet. So you can it your kidney pudding or how we called it - urinal cake.
792 2018-12-17 22:32:58 Oil Trade Below Russia’s Desired $55-65 Range Even as US Output Stalls
793 2018-12-17 22:32:51 *sigh*

"Can you look at this rash?" Followed quickly by "That's not WebMD and this lifestyle blogger say! I'm sticking with apple cider vinegar and coconut oil."
794 2018-12-17 22:32:50 With oil, growth, employment dropping, and QE4 coming, imo rates can stay lower for longer.
 
Although helicopter money in conjunction with populist uprisings and rising deficits might raise inflation enough to need raising rates.
795 2018-12-17 22:32:49 Cut the cash and oil/gas flow. Then they'll wake up
796 2018-12-17 22:32:47 QC already takes a whack of AB oil. Despite the lies your party and your federal counterpart have spread, QC is not preferring oil from Saudi Arabia.

Why is it so hard for you to be fair and tell the truth?

@AlbertaParty is sorely needed for honest Cons.

#abpoli
797 2018-12-17 22:32:44 The reason why Nigeria politician like one Nigeria is because of the free oil money, not for the interest of the masses
798 2018-12-17 22:32:36 Wouldn’t oil in the 20s be wildly deflationary?  Stocks would probably be off quite a bit.  What would be the impetus to raise rates in that scenario?
799 2018-12-17 22:32:30 I constantly suffer with it.  Sudafed will do the trick plus nasal steaming with a few drops of Olbas oil.  nothing worse than a sinus infection get well soon x

802 2018-12-17 22:32:18 That's because they allow skin oil contact on a regular basis. I don't, so I don't have to bother with plasticizer
803 2018-12-17 22:32:07 5km圏外ではほとんど誰も避難しなくて良いことになっているOILの指針を原子力規制委員会が作ったことが現状の原因かと思います。
804 2018-12-17 22:32:05 Ratings don’t matter. We don’t need customers. We have our oil allies that kill people to fund us. Why deal with customers when the Saudis love our dance?

806 2018-12-17 22:32:02 my mom asked me a ton of questions abt my essential oil diffuser so I made a video showing her how it works and sent it to her where is my daughter of the year award
807 2018-12-17 22:32:01 people that spend 100+ on oil changes are really tripping bro im glad i know how to do my own now fuck that
808 2018-12-17 22:31:47 Sorry, tell me again what Kenney has announced as policy to get pipelines built and bring back $100/bbl oil and 3% unemployment? Other than promise to repeal the CT despite it being recommended by the industry as something we NEED to move forward?
809 2018-12-17 22:31:45 I'm not a great cook, but I'd make just one dish but separate their food out as I cooked. Like I'd make pasta and put the good sauce on mine but just olive oil and salt, or grated cheese on theirs. Or chicken curry, but hold out some chicken from the sauce for them.
810 2018-12-17 22:31:38 The majority of the increase in U.S. oil production occurred on “private land” during the Obama admin.

The EIA reported in 2015 that while U.S. oil and gas production overall were surging, production of natural gas on “federal lands” was declining.
811 2018-12-17 22:31:36 does Wild Growth Hair Oil work?
812 2018-12-17 22:31:27 cannabis oil
813 2018-12-17 22:31:22 I was the same this year. I got him a Whataburger yeti, boot dryer for his work boots and an oil painting pillow of Bill Murray but I imagine your husband wouldn't want any of those things. 
814 2018-12-17 22:31:20 you dont change your oil or what?
815 2018-12-17 22:31:19 Higher than england will by far. So what does England have to offer the world, has the UK government invested in England? Nope Scotland has oil, water, gas, infrastructure, tradesmen and agriculture in abundance. None of which England has to support half of thier population.
816 2018-12-17 22:31:17 Does anyone know if CBD oil helps with joint pain? My knees are literally crippling me at the minute
817 2018-12-17 22:31:02 This is incredible— bw the #GreenNewDeal, the Energy Innovation & Carbon Dividends Act (H.R. 7131), & the carbon tax supported by oil companies, there are now *three* #climatechange policy proposals for the U.S. House of Reps in the next session of Congress!
818 2018-12-17 22:31:01 What was Russian MOTIVE?
Don't tell me some country interfered with election without a MOTIVE?
Did Russia want America to have:
Stronger Military?
OIL INDEPENDENCE?
Strong Economy?
High EMPLOYMENT?
Low UNEMPLOYMENT?
More NATO Contributors?
...
We need to hear the MOTIVE?

819 2018-12-17 22:30:39 The upside, if it leaks oil it means it still has some.

822 2018-12-17 22:30:32 They gotta get that bread for their oil 
823 2018-12-17 22:30:32 If the Prime Minister was a normal human being he would have to start listening but his actions against the oil industry and the Alberta economy are deliberate. Just like his father the goal is to ensure political and economic power remain in Quebec by destroying the west
824 2018-12-17 22:30:14 @arc2x4 You are so correct Sir . The Socialist want us to get rid of King Oil .The French President wanted to fuel taxes by 63% so as to get the French people to  wean off using gasoline so much .Two years ago when I went to Germany a liter of gas cost $3.60 or $14.40 a gallon.
825 2018-12-17 22:30:10 The guy telling me what's wrong with my car when I want is an oil change and wheel alignment
826 2018-12-17 22:30:07 depends, are they actually made of cabal oil?

829 2018-12-17 22:29:49 Thought exactly the same thing. Plastic and hot oil = not good.

832 2018-12-17 22:29:38 That poncho was a terrible idea, if you got hot oil on it it would have melted onto your clothes or face. Otherwise 10/10 
833 2018-12-17 22:29:27 So Jason about the funding you received from car salesmen and big oil and the promises you made to them?
834 2018-12-17 22:29:22 Moscow must pay for it! Full embargo on oil and gas from Russia. Disconnect them from the SWIFT system
835 2018-12-17 22:29:06 Oh I get it, they used motor oil instead of syrup.
836 2018-12-17 22:29:04 My car just told me it needs an oil change. I’m kinda freaked out about that lol.
837 2018-12-17 22:28:39 Yam and oil. The best
838 2018-12-17 22:28:39 White ppl have made OIL economically viable but if they wake up & say "u know what, oil is wack" , oil will be worthless
839 2018-12-17 22:28:37 party that claims to care about its base as well as climate change and the country refuse to back candidates that are anti-intervention, pro medicare for all, and divested from oil companies.

It's not like we're being oblique about our policy preferences, and they are shared by

841 2018-12-17 22:28:29 >found elsewhere in the solar system

Organics ahve been seen but Oil? Not seen any samples from anywhere to indicate this, but there is hope yet. Maybe Mars will enlighten us.
842 2018-12-17 22:28:29 I ordered my Italian hoagie with oil and vinegar and they put mayo on it instead now said hoagie is in the trash
843 2018-12-17 22:28:21 Ahh lallai
844 2018-12-17 22:28:18 it's basically preemptively surrendering to the political power of the oil lobby by choosing the climate policy that financially benefits current oil shareholders the most.

847 2018-12-17 22:28:04 You mean you didn’t know he started the shale oil boom!? Lol! That man is severely delusional. He just happened to be taking office as it started. It would have happened with or without him. That’s a fact.
848 2018-12-17 22:28:04 I'm gonna go with Oranges, if it had peel on it.  Neither cats nor dogs like citrus oil.

858 2018-12-17 22:26:35 Oil was the big factor.
859 2018-12-17 22:26:29 palm oil is in everything sadly. cutting it out is almost impossible. as for bees... we shouldn't have nonnative bees doing our pollinating so that's a whole diff discussion.
dairy uses way more water & the laborers are just as maltreated. this is really a capitalism problem.
860 2018-12-17 22:26:25 the economy is mostly drugs and oil. i’m reminded of this every time i hotbox my car.
861 2018-12-17 22:26:17 He interim guy is an oil lobbyist.
862 2018-12-17 22:26:17 Oh and basil, plenty of oil
863 2018-12-17 22:26:11 Hitlers lack of Oil was the determining factor, thats why he had to attack Russia, to get the oil to run all their machinery and fuel their conquered states.
864 2018-12-17 22:26:02 This all my opinion though... But I don't believe a government should be voted out because of the hardship we face today, which is the sequelae of recession, Recession which was inevitable. This govt did much with little resources, Now price of oil is rising and they can do more.
865 2018-12-17 22:25:55 several that have come to light in recent weeks:
1. he accepts loads of money from oil & gas industry
2. he doesn’t decisively support M4A
3. he cozies up with AIPAC
4. he lost to ted cruz, a highly unpopular republican who lost to trump
866 2018-12-17 22:25:38 That Magical Masonic Number.Symbolism will be their down fall, right?A "Trophy".  That would be 1976.HMMM.That would mean the limo was used by LBJ,Tricky Dick and Gerald Ford.All apart/knowledge of the assassination.Who were at Oil man Clint Murchison's party the night before?
867 2018-12-17 22:25:38 Need to oil my joints again. I swear, sometimes I feel like the tin man from the wizard of oz =A=
868 2018-12-17 22:25:36 The ESG statement specifically talks about divesting from coal but makes no specific mention of a commitment to Oil and Gas divestment. Can you commit to divest from companies whose primary activity is Oil or Gas production?
869 2018-12-17 22:25:15 That's actually motor oil
870 2018-12-17 22:25:14 Arábia Saudita tem custo de 6 dolares pra extrair oil...

873 2018-12-17 22:25:04 That’s motor oil
874 2018-12-17 22:25:04 Brother Nigerian political promises are like fishing with rod at a mall for crude oil...Isn't that person...Complete it well your answer is for Nigerians truly nothing when the learned professionals are destroyed by ignorance waiting for someone then why are you smart... 
875 2018-12-17 22:24:54 And how much Saudi oil is refined into fuel and then shipped to Quebec, because we are importing a shit ton of SA oil.
876 2018-12-17 22:24:52 SO it really is a wild goose chase because things appear so transparent and fair but like oil,water, or mercury coming together ,white ppl come together and the minute u try to catch on,they come apart. Rinse & repeat.
877 2018-12-17 22:24:46 Castorate ? As in potassium castorate from caster oil? Why would it be ok to give Mueller castor oil??
878 2018-12-17 22:24:26 The UK as the successor state would inherit all the assets and all the debt under a no deal scenario as legally it would own both. International lenders would be jumping with joy at the thought of lending to an oil producing country with no debt.
879 2018-12-17 22:24:23 Oil is definately not a fuel made from conveniently placed dead dinosaurs.  It is abiotic and can be found elsewhere in the solar system, and at depths that dinosaurs never ventured to.
880 2018-12-17 22:24:22 Helping to pay, e.g. for Oil’s assault on I-1631.  Until they divest, they have direct stake in the failure of our climate policies and solutions.
881 2018-12-17 22:24:16 do better, quit buying saudi oil!
882 2018-12-17 22:24:15 Quebec buys oil from Saudi's et Venezuela?
883 2018-12-17 22:24:12 If my dad bought me there I'd probably want to work in the oil patch too. Good money if the jobs are there.
884 2018-12-17 22:24:09 Do you ever just listen to Postal Service a bunch to bring all your emotions to the top like oil on water yeah me neither
885 2018-12-17 22:24:07 What's the point in a  #carbontax when the governments in Canada just keep exempting oil from it..oil is the major polluter.
886 2018-12-17 22:24:05 Pg. 97"'would you be so kind as to-?' 'Would you mind?' 'Thank you' little courtesies like these oil the cogs of the monotonous grind of everyday life- and, incidentally, they are the hallmark of good breeding." #htwfaip
887 2018-12-17 22:23:57 My kids love anything with soy sauce and sesame oil, so stir fries are always welcome. Also, tikka masala paste + coconut milk is always a hit.
Also, hot dogs :(
888 2018-12-17 22:23:50 I didn't know that about Panera, places really should label thier soups, that stuff make will make veggies or vegans sick!
Meat is hidden so much stuff it's insane!
It seems like everything has meat or palm oil
889 2018-12-17 22:23:34 @ESPAskincare I ordered some body oil for a Christmas gift, it arrived having leaked in transit so cannot be gifted. Emailed you 13.12 but no response. When are you going to get in touch with me to resolve this?
890 2018-12-17 22:23:31 The current education system is really shortchanging our children on blue collar opportunities. Just saw an ad recruiting oil and gas workers, plumbers, and electricians for $80/hr. No 5/6 figure debt required.
891 2018-12-17 22:23:29 Resistance BS.

“Hey Vlad, great idea here! 
Instead of watching Hillary keep the restrictions on oil and gas, let’s help Trump and watch him lift them. 
It’ll drive up America’s supply and wreck our economy! 
We might even end up with a GDP even lower than LA County.”

895 2018-12-17 22:23:04 Bravo to Iceland for standing strong on their ban & bravo to the UK govt for not intervening. Indonesia & Malaysia need to understand that their claim to fame is destroying the natural world and its inhabitants. We need more ballsy govt officials to take a hard stand re:palm oil

921 2018-12-17 22:19:39 Even in that article it recognizes that you’ll need facilities that burn oil to offset the loss of electricity from nat gas and renewables due to cold weather. Personally I don’t agree in shutting down nuclear power plants to supplement that electricity with nat gas.
922 2018-12-17 22:19:38 Why is this Holmes a Court being given oxygen?  Must have money invested in renewables subsidies. . Snake oil salesmen of the 21st century. .
923 2018-12-17 22:19:36 we are heading somewhere. Where infrastructure will better our economy. Agriculture will reduce the stress on oil. Rate of importation will reduce. Our treasury will be safe. A politician can be jailed. With our economy gradually gaining ground, I'm hopeful life will get better.

929 2018-12-17 22:19:07 Trudeau said he wants to Alberta oil phased out.... but Newfoundland says, "Newfoundland and Labrador is on the verge of a new era in frontier oil exploration and development" .... the technology for oilsands extraction and upgrading is a CDN success story, but not for Trudeau.
930 2018-12-17 22:19:04 More completions in Nov while stocks prices and oil prices had cratered demonstrates the E&P mind set.

I would not expect a quick production drop. Even if they cut back huge, drop will be seen in Jan. As of now EIA is expecting growth based on completions.
931 2018-12-17 22:19:02 I got dry scaly skin in my ear canals!  Doc said put olive oil in my ears (just a drop).  Maybe it would help your trouble spots, too.

939 2018-12-17 22:18:25 As Gerry Butts says facts matter 
Here’s where Quebec gets its oil. In short, over the past few years Alberta (because of the Line 9 reversal) and US oil has replaced just about all other sources.  

Facts do matter.

942 2018-12-17 22:18:08 Wear your hair in protective styles/braided while applying moisture DAILY via the LOC method(liquid, oil, cream-based product) but if you’re looking for a specific moisturizer/styling product I recommend @OrganiGrowHair everytime. Their insta is better to see testimonials
943 2018-12-17 22:17:37 It was American bombers that destroyed Hitler’s industrial infrastructure in Germany. It was the British and American army and Navy that cut off his oil supply lines from North Africa.  There really is no right answer or wrong answer here.
944 2018-12-17 22:17:20 It is.  But I agree with CutRealty that oil is not as much a concern as the massive divisions between normally decent people and their opposing ideologies. The "social climate" has become very hostile throughout most of the Planet. Common sense & civility is being choked out.
945 2018-12-17 22:17:12 Yes marley he is safe. Warm settled. Still dopey (no change there then. Lol) I mean from the drugs. But he's a fighter that's for sure. Th vets luv hm.

947 2018-12-17 22:17:04 Not azurfa. Normal.
948 2018-12-17 22:17:00 And 4 countries stop trading oil with dollars,  instead they are using yuan. That means those unused dollars has to go back
949 2018-12-17 22:16:50 I like where your head's at. I use oil, but butter works also, I would just have plenty of it in there. I just do em in the oven. I like seasoned salt, but to each his own.
950 2018-12-17 22:16:49 I'm so sorry to hear what you have to go through! That sounds extremely painful, I would recommend CBD Oil instead of Salve and we would love to help out so I was given the go-ahead to give you a 20% permanent discount to our store for all your CBD needs if you would like it!

956 2018-12-17 22:15:53 America is  nor @realDonaldTrump 'a and @realDonaldTrump  is not America. He is a cheap imitation  designer bag full of  snake oil

959 2018-12-17 22:15:42 be awash with data / bumper harvest / drizzle olive oil / vintner /
960 2018-12-17 22:15:24 If this is what the sign is about, it doesn't convey it well. To me, it essentially says oil is more important than trees. And I live in a province now as dependant on oil as Alberta.
961 2018-12-17 22:15:22 I agree, hard to get away with "not trying" with the coach the manager and your team mates. Just doesn't happen (often)
962 2018-12-17 22:15:18 It's the end of the day, so I’ve bought some of that oil which Sir Lancelot used to lubricate his armour.

972 2018-12-17 22:14:36 Anybody use cbd oil for their dogs? If so, where is the best place to buy it?
973 2018-12-17 22:14:17 spiralised cucumber oil salt & lemon... Yum
974 2018-12-17 22:14:13 It's criminal how #BigOil is entrenched in the Canadian government. And it doesn't matter which of the main parties are in power. Corporations are running the country. 80% of Canada's oil and gas production sector emissions will be exempt from paying a carbon price. #cdnpoli
975 2018-12-17 22:14:09 Or olive oil works too as a spot treatment
976 2018-12-17 22:14:03 Thanks for the suggestion.  But I don’t heat with gas, or oil, or wood.  Have a Merry Christmas.
977 2018-12-17 22:14:01 This is not true at all. In 2018, a small investor has a fantastic array of asset class to choose from.

With $10k you could buy art, real estate, gold, massive oil tanker, stock market, cryptos, private credit, business loans, a hotel room, student accommodation, etc.

Does anyone have an oil fueled boiler and have a local or national company that does a service plan where breakages and call outs are included etc? I have looked everywhere online and have been beaten. Thanks in advance.
979 2018-12-17 22:13:25 So Buhari can come and present 2019 Budget when he has not told us the performance of 2018 Budget, that excess crude oil dollar in 2018 Budget, where is it? We can't go on with this ritual, we must ask questions and answers must be provided
980 2018-12-17 22:13:18 Try making a violet abstract expressionist work with sesame oil!
981 2018-12-17 22:13:17 I cry its so therapeutic for me, i wait for nightfall take a bath lather myself in coconut/any oil wear socks be comfortable then cry it all out
982 2018-12-17 22:13:13 Throwback to that time I cooked a roast pork shoulder for family with 5 year old ear drum cleaning olive oil...
Everyone said its the best crackling they ever had  until I told them...
983 2018-12-17 22:13:11 2/2 I'm not gonna say that the oil lost because the Canucks were playing cheap ..we lost because the Canucks were able to execute well on the power plays they received..warranted or not ..Canucks out played and petersons shot was slick..either way I'm sick of the shit officials

986 2018-12-17 22:12:42 DJT's got a protective coating of oil that prevents anyone from grabbing him. Mueller knows this and plans an intense grilling.
987 2018-12-17 22:12:40 I love it when a plan comes together...It's been a good year  #bonds #rates #SPX #oil #EM #dollar #oilstocks #google #EUbanks #USAssetmanagers  But I do know that when I think my shit smells of roses, Im about to get my face rubbed in it! Hubris never pays.

992 2018-12-17 22:11:55 The solution is simple a global outlaw of commercial plastics, like cups, plates, utensils, grocery bags, etc. Most if not all can be manufactured from hemp. Problem is plastics are derived from petroleum and natural gas. Can't be cutting into big oil profits now, can we?
993 2018-12-17 22:11:39 Not oil, need a port-a-potty cleaning truck load or more
994 2018-12-17 22:11:33 Lagyan mo baby oil or kahit anong oil wag lang mantika hahahaha charls
995 2018-12-17 22:11:24 Sally honey bless your little heart..  Those people The bankers, big pharma and oil companies aren't GOP.. but they have conned you.. they are Globalist, leftist, Satanist enablers, who would [ and do] sell our Children for profit. You need a Red Pill my dear.

1004 2018-12-17 22:10:28 Ok these are the things my mom has advocated in the past for ear pain: plug your nose and recite Quran out loud (will make your ears pop?) and/or put olive oil in a cotton ball and put it in your ear

1009 2018-12-17 22:09:56 Stop buying Saudi oil and build Energy East.  There's a win win. Enough with the virtue signalling that destroys jobs and economic progress.  Keep up destroying the economy and you'll run out of people to tax.

1012 2018-12-17 22:09:30 The other oil producing variety is Karoneiki.
1013 2018-12-17 22:09:21 I'm an Iowan and I want to see people of color and women in the running. Also people who will not accept corporate donations especially big oil, pharma, insurance, banking, tech. A concerted effort to return to "of the people, by the people". Lead by example.
1014 2018-12-17 22:09:16 Glowing skin: Massage your face daily at night with almond oil and honey mixture and wash it with cold water after few minutes.
1015 2018-12-17 22:08:58 Does any Saudi oil get shipped to Portland, Maine and then get transported into Quebec?
1016 2018-12-17 22:08:41 We need to leave the oil in the ground. We can send ships & people into space, but no alternative to oil as an energy source? I call BULLSHIT! This is greed of the monopoly's.  We need change to protect whats left of the environment.  @UNFCCC
1017 2018-12-17 22:08:35 Oil is definitely a fossil fuel.
1018 2018-12-17 22:08:29 I think all agree alternative energy sources are the future but a long way from being developed to the point of being reliable & affordable to most everybody. Can we not accept oil & gas industry as one of the leaders in this area of R&D without demonizing all related to it ?
1019 2018-12-17 22:08:27 Tampons make cramps worse!!! I have stage 4 Endometriosis, I know the feeling of horrific cramps!! Take Aleve, drink caffeine, use CBD oil edibles, in skincare products, etc, if they get too bad, ask Dr for prn pain meds/muscle relaxers!! I'm so sorry ur going thru bad cramps
1020 2018-12-17 22:08:17 Chef Finch. I'm supposed to know what foods make you feel better. Avoid dairy, chicken and roast your veggies. The less oil you consume, the better.
1021 2018-12-17 22:08:16 I caught a good ass sale at fine foods today 2 for 5 olive oil and 5 for 5 hass avocados
1022 2018-12-17 22:08:14 Same with Amaya dude I’ve been putting RC oil on her it’s helped alotttttttt

1026 2018-12-17 22:07:36 Lmao the west coast don’t give a fuck about the rest of Canada this is not news we been knew since the Harper oil days!!!!!! I was in 6th grade and I knew!!!!
1027 2018-12-17 22:07:33 Lol #accurate. My classmates voted me "Most Likely To Need Oil to Continue Life"
1028 2018-12-17 22:07:31 Ladies when was the last time y'all had an oil change?
1029 2018-12-17 22:07:22 Either the Arbequina or Arbosana variety for oil.
1030 2018-12-17 22:07:22 Wew lad. What do you think oil is then?
1031 2018-12-17 22:07:19 Wait I'm Italian. That's racist because I'm skinny and tall. 

Bonus joke: im like olive oil. Extra virgin.
1032 2018-12-17 22:07:14 Trade embargo for nationalizing oil and mining a decade ago. US interests owned a large chunk of mining and oil rights and refused to pay more royalties. Similar to Alberta Canada but it resulted in Venezuela economy to tank.
1033 2018-12-17 22:07:09 It was a stellar year for the WSJ but that one wins the Dumb As a Bag of Hammers award for 2018. Permian oil is today below $40 and the EIA projects 134K BOPD more of the stuff in Jan; Conoco sez +25% of LTO in 2019! The shale oil industry has overdosed on stupid pills. Again!
1034 2018-12-17 22:07:07 No our government is believing their lies to get cheaper oil
1035 2018-12-17 22:07:06 Big Oil has done more to promote renewable energy than a hack like you ever will.
1036 2018-12-17 22:06:51 Like the UK IMF bail out before Scottish n sea oil was discovered? UK was bankrupt until then!

Never mind, one day you'll get a real job making a real contribution to society.
Any idea when your party will stop having the laziest mp's? Non-attendance, but still picking up wages & expenses.
1039 2018-12-17 22:06:20 Thank you very much for the tips. I'm a bit short on the other ingredients as I'm in the middle of nowhere and I need to cook this now, but I will stir fry them as you suggest and see what happens. I have garlic, lemongrass and chilli oil. Do you think that might work?
1040 2018-12-17 22:06:10 My skin is disgustingly oily! Those kind of makes I rarely use because they’re too moisturising and better for dry skin, maybe once a month! It’s better to use mud masks which absorb oil!
1041 2018-12-17 22:06:07 Whoa looking at you now I'd have had no idea!! 

My struggle with acne has gone on for years and no antibiotics worked for me but the pill is expensive in Japan so I'm off it now and I think squalane oil which I only found out about last week is saving my skin thankfully 
1042 2018-12-17 22:06:04 Given the respective scales (and declining oil production) that claim was pretty ridiculous.
1043 2018-12-17 22:06:00 What the flying fuck is Kendall cooking... and why so much oil  #LoveIslandReunion
1044 2018-12-17 22:05:59 The first one don’t even look like that touch oil
1045 2018-12-17 22:05:56 I believe in it. but I don’t think it’s celebs. I think it’s the chase and rockafella families. the families that “own the world” that like own money and oil and natural resources.
1046 2018-12-17 22:05:54 Jamaica's inflation rate has fallen to 0% in November 2018.
That was not a surprise given the fall in oil prices and USD devaluation over time. That's essentially what @cliffnationwide is alluding to in the sentence 'lower electricity rates'. Think I'd said that previously.
1047 2018-12-17 22:05:45 Good luck!
His likely successor is a former oil lobbyist!! 
1048 2018-12-17 22:05:39 Olive oil is like a kinda weird slang for skinny and tall.
1049 2018-12-17 22:05:22 Could you & the 21 folks who listen to you please sell everything you own (including your home), hunt & grow your own food,  live outside & rebuild from nothing.

If you can’t do that, then you rely on oil just as much as the rest off us.

Are you tweeting on a head of lettuce?

1051 2018-12-17 22:05:04 I do not get the impression that Mr. Scheer or #CPC supporters in general will share this 'do the right thing' sentiment
They'd be happy if Quebec stopped buying Saudi Oil
<cough> they don't buy Saudi Oil now
1052 2018-12-17 22:05:02 Bout to go get the whip a oil change

1054 2018-12-17 22:04:49 Oil, oil, everywhere.
1055 2018-12-17 22:04:28 I will say, I think the whole “Beto is in the pocket of big oil” thing is overblown. 
- he ran in Texas so he needed every dollar he could get and there is a lot of oil money there.
- that number as a percentage isn’t as bad as others
- oil employees still count as oil $
1056 2018-12-17 22:04:24 Cancer the cash cow. Impacting my family too, heartbreaking for everyone, hate this for you. Think CBD oil, @CBDivahealth for a little help and keep fighting. Oh yeah, workout if you can, nice walks can fill down time so well!
1057 2018-12-17 22:04:21 Snake oil salesman! And I am a Christian.

1062 2018-12-17 22:03:41 Alberta cutting was nonsense.  They couldn’t get the oil out anyway...oil was trading at 80% discount...please
1063 2018-12-17 22:03:38 Alot of the major 2% drop is crude oil. Wow 2%
Which do you want? High gas price at the pump? Or a low price at the pump?
1064 2018-12-17 22:03:37 You know the demand for Oil is going up right?
1065 2018-12-17 22:03:33 I'm actually going to buy some oil lamps for my desk today based on this conversation- I think it'll be better when I'm working at night
1066 2018-12-17 22:03:09 East, don't import Saudi oil, keep the lavs
1067 2018-12-17 22:03:08 Well, if private sector employment is rising while oil prices are in the crapper, perhaps people should pay attention as to why that is happening instead of moving goal posts to vilify the government. Just a thought.
1068 2018-12-17 22:03:08 We can send ships into space, but can't find an environmentally friendly alternative to oil? Bullshit! There has to be solutions, but big monopoly is just to greedy to make the changes that people want & need to stop climate change. @UNFCCC

1072 2018-12-17 22:02:21 That would be because oil is fast running out you stupid little twerp. Hence the reason oil prices are constantly going up. Renewable (solar, hydro, wind) and Nuclear energy are the only sustainable energy sources for the future.
1073 2018-12-17 22:02:17 Wow this guy is a straight loser. Completely making up claims for his own pockets. Keep peddling that snake oil you fraud.

1080 2018-12-17 22:01:08 To bring awareness regarding the dangerous snake oil she supports. People die because they don’t seek proper medical treatment. She has a lot of followers. I would hate for someone to die because they believed the quackery she supports.

1082 2018-12-17 22:00:53 @ReginaPizzeria probably a weird question, but what kind of olive oil do you use to make the spicy oil with the red pepper flakes?
1083 2018-12-17 22:00:49 Great let’s have a law making it 100% Canadian oil. And ban those tankers from the St. Lawrence save the Belugas. Or is that the right message Gerry?

1091 2018-12-17 22:00:27 Y’all arguing with a muppet & a chick that look like she sell oil perfumes on the corner? Surely we can be doing something better with our time.
1092 2018-12-17 22:00:24 Oil Crude $49.15 a barrel today. Lowest in a long time!!!
1093 2018-12-17 22:00:23 Impressive, but that won't fix $50 oil selling at a $35 discount in an industry producing it at $60 per barrel. Nothing to do with Justin, everything to do with MATH.
1094 2018-12-17 22:00:20 Dude, the studies have already been done comparing bird deaths from oil spills with wind turbines- guess which has killed more!

1096 2018-12-17 21:59:59 食パンさんおはようございます！
1097 2018-12-17 21:59:59 All right we got the price of a barrel of oil under $50 per barrel. Good job dip shit. Can’t stand ya but let’s keep the price right about there or even lower.
1098 2018-12-17 21:59:47 I always drink coffee black. This weekend I started adding a half teaspoon sized scoop of coconut oil. It’s legit. No going back
1099 2018-12-17 21:59:43 Makes sense .. I got an air fryer so ion use oil anymore
1100 2018-12-17 21:59:40 It’s not the best sort of stuff as it’s oil based. Get some Aqua cream in, I think you might find that more effective.

1104 2018-12-17 21:59:14 I hope you've parked your car, drained your mower, sold the boat and don't plan on flying ever again or heating your house!
Bloody mental midgets....wakd up...we need oil and gas!
1105 2018-12-17 21:59:11 Hussein Obama was an oil producer? He couldn’t get the keystone pipeline, shut down coal companies, embarrassed the US by apologizing to EVERYONE, forced his  insurance on us, let boys in the girls bathroom and kissed the Muslim Brotherhood’s arses.  THAT is what he did.
1106 2018-12-17 21:59:04 Ok so you want to blame all our employment issues on oil prices and credit NDP for job gains that went along with oil price recovery lol. Like I said you along with everyone will get the chance to vote on the NDP record in only a few short months.
1107 2018-12-17 21:58:55 You might be surprised to learn that those big bad oil companies have R&D departments working in the background on renewable or cleaner energy development, paid for by selling today’s resources. It’s how the real world works

Chilean law enforcement officials are investigating the delivery of Iranian crude oil to the state energy company ENAP as a possible source of the noxious fumes that caused hundreds of people to seek hospital
1115 2018-12-17 21:58:17 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,
because once Kyu incorrectly entered oil when
cooking a simple ham.
1116 2018-12-17 21:58:14 Since when does Shell know that burning Oil is pushing the climatecrisis?
1117 2018-12-17 21:58:12 Lemon juice and olive oil. 50-50 in a cup/glass/shotglass depending on preference and you gulp that down with two asprin and sleep it off. 

Eat some oats in the morning and hydrate... Staying regular is the basis of good health.
1118 2018-12-17 21:58:05 Crude oil
1119 2018-12-17 21:58:05 Don’t worry Longs oil will be back to $65 by end of the year  #OOTT
1120 2018-12-17 21:58:03 Oil prices hammered , ASOS profit warning , no agreement between Italy & EU over budget , Brexit chaos as Labour table a NO CONFIDENCE vote , US government shut down , CHINA trade war , Twitter hit by hacking concerns , J&J found guilty 

Do we need more bearish news arguments?
1121 2018-12-17 21:57:54 He sounded like that from the get-go. And like a snake oil salesman ... awful awful.
1122 2018-12-17 21:57:50 So!! I try so hard not to be one of those conspiracy nuts - “BUT” How can we have a bomming economy- lowest Unemployment in decades- Now a Huge OIL Exporter- Oil coming out our ears But the STOCK MARKET DROPS 500 points! Somebody somewhere is playing games! Yep- I’m a nut!!
1123 2018-12-17 21:57:46 Reading it again it seems that he was on the stronger stuff & not CBD oil! Hmm
1124 2018-12-17 21:57:38 when you get an oil change, it says customers can’t go in the garage... my dad thinks this doesn’t apply to him
1125 2018-12-17 21:57:25 Alec is linking oil again.
1126 2018-12-17 21:57:23 lol 
1127 2018-12-17 21:56:59 @missashleycali DID YOU GET AN OIL CHANGE
1128 2018-12-17 21:56:51 On that note, I agree. Our debt to GDP ratio is getting to high. And any move to peg oil to a non dollar currency gets a strong US response.  Thankfully the US now a net exporter of oil/natural gas.
1129 2018-12-17 21:56:41 Synthetic oil is taking over. Deal with it.
1130 2018-12-17 21:56:38 For medicinal value, vape pens are for the win! Joints give you at least 20%, vape pens give you 80-90% of medicinal value. This is due to the oil in the vape being set to a temperature that does not boil the plant matter. :)
1131 2018-12-17 21:56:31 *He groans as you lift him, spitting oil on you* Only because she made me this way
1132 2018-12-17 21:56:29 Breaking: 2 cute young rascals caught vandalizing their Pa's car with engine oil... The culprits were paraded on Twitter as they await persecution.
1133 2018-12-17 21:56:18 No where does this lovely child actually make suggestions for solutions...I dare her to speak to the oil sheiks in the same tone.
1134 2018-12-17 21:56:12 On the grill with butter, sea salt and a little olive oil will change your mind.
1135 2018-12-17 21:56:07 ermm  not due to socialism was a factor of conservative legacy and oil and demands from financial sector

dont you know anything?
1136 2018-12-17 21:56:06 Oklahoma is crawling with millionaires, they just tend to be not as flashy as their coastal peers. Lots of old oil money.
1137 2018-12-17 21:56:05 This monk on the the journey was fat. Something that stood out to me was his head, it "was bald, which shone like any glass, and his face did too, as if he had been rubbed with oil." (198-200) #nasty
1138 2018-12-17 21:55:58 #12DaysofSwarfega This would be fab for my hubby! He's an engineer and comes home covered in oil & grease most days! 
1139 2018-12-17 21:55:53 Sorry guys, here's the math. 
$50 oil - $35 Western Select= $15 bbl 
Oilsands Cost per barrel = $60+
No pipeline because -$45 per barrel makes no sense, not because Justin Trudeau is an environmentalist
1140 2018-12-17 21:55:51 I dont think government’s role to referee income differences. Set a minimum safety net so no-one’s starving of course.

But much inequality due to vast externalities imposed on rest of society by oil magnates, frequent fliers etc, and CO2 tax would target these more accurately
1141 2018-12-17 21:55:45 Oh i know haha. Firestone always overcharges I feel like. They charged me $70 one time because they put synthetic oil in instead of conventional without asking me
1142 2018-12-17 21:55:43 If I felt like it was worth my time and effort instead of paying the dealer to do it, I'd give their motor oil a try.
1143 2018-12-17 21:55:40 Yes because Canabis oil is a derivative of hemp and not the drug. I have used it to relieve back pain, you buy it at Holland & Barrett.
1144 2018-12-17 21:55:37 パンさんこっちでもおはごですー！
1145 2018-12-17 21:55:37 Fake, phony, fraud. Self-serving snake oil salesman and huckster.
1146 2018-12-17 21:55:25 Oreos with a side of guilt for the use of palm oil & destruction of orangutan habitat.
1147 2018-12-17 21:55:06 @Oven_oil @sboer been there done that years ago huh guys
1148 2018-12-17 21:55:04 oil lamps 4500BC
1149 2018-12-17 21:54:54 Is God's will really murder flooding the streets?
Can we measure her love by the oil underneath?
All I ever wanted was what I was told I was owed
At what cost? I'll never know
1150 2018-12-17 21:54:51 If we can't get out of the deal, we certainly should replace the 600,000 barrels of  Saudi oil flowing down the St. Laurence each day, regardless of what any one Premier wants. 
Cdn. cash should not be flowing to Dictatorial Regime that is that is CORRUPT, IMO.
1151 2018-12-17 21:54:37 pls dont moisturize with coconut oil
1152 2018-12-17 21:54:24 Recently bought some essential oil rollers from @Sajewellness ... I gotta say, it really has me feeling better throughout a slow day. I use the "energy" oil and I love it 
1153 2018-12-17 21:54:21 We sent people to fight a war that was always about oil & the $139bn KBR/Halliburton etc earned from it. All wars are about money as bankers finance arms deals on both sides and the winner sweeps up. Blair lost his moral compass. I’m not sure he ever found it again
1154 2018-12-17 21:54:17 Generally burning something physical for light yes

Maybe Paul can correct me, but I believe the only light source older than candles and early oil lanterns is wood fires itself
1155 2018-12-17 21:54:12 Your price is going up permanent with a baseline above what we pay now if we implement domestic oil.
1156 2018-12-17 21:54:12 What the hell is going on? Why haven't we seen any new promos for Cheer Fight? I hope your new rules don't prevent 2 girls from having an oil fight. That was one of my favorite comics!!! #cheerfight #teasecomix
1157 2018-12-17 21:54:08 Or you could stop buying there Oil and continue the arms sales.
1158 2018-12-17 21:54:02 I gotta go to the store I don’t have enough oil lol
1159 2018-12-17 21:53:56 WE HAVE THE VERY SAME IN SCOTLAND
WE ARE SCARED TO ANNOY ENGLUSH FOLKS
IN CASE THEY START TO TELL LIES ANDCSTEAL LAND AND OIL FROM US
1160 2018-12-17 21:53:56 CBD is the snake oil of our generation. People were saying the same shit about heroin being the magic heal all in the Wild West 
1161 2018-12-17 21:53:56 Bring back up oil prices
1162 2018-12-17 21:53:49 Tony Blair is worth about 50 million because of his decision to back Bush. If had not backed him he would be like the Kinnocks and only worth about 10 million. It was and always is business when invading these oil rich countries.
1163 2018-12-17 21:53:38 Easy answer, It was called Conventional Oil wells.
1164 2018-12-17 21:53:32 Using coconut oil works well with Mai as well.
1165 2018-12-17 21:53:29 I am very blessed to have a car but I just wanna say getting oil changes is annoying.
1166 2018-12-17 21:53:27 Right - she still stayed I went to change oil 
1167 2018-12-17 21:53:23 The point of the chart is that extraction cost is directly related to oil & OFS price not productivity.
1168 2018-12-17 21:53:20 Castor oil, I do treatment once or twice a month, deep conditioning every other week, wild growth oil
1169 2018-12-17 21:53:17 Galau mau beli cleansing oil innisfree atau heimish cleansinh balm hhh
1170 2018-12-17 21:53:12 Logique libérale: Il n'y a pas d'acceptabilité sociale pour l'Alberta Oil à aller sur le marché. L'acceptabilité sociale d'importer du pétrole provenant de régimes hautement répressifs qui ne sont pas soumis aux mêmes normes strictes est très acceptable.

Change Maintenant
1171 2018-12-17 21:53:10  I gotta go now cause I don’t have oil  I’m so mad lol
1172 2018-12-17 21:53:09 #PESmas
1173 2018-12-17 21:52:57 Oil, orange juice, falling, broken oven?
1174 2018-12-17 21:52:51 Dude's logged into his work benefit portal and shopping for oil at 4pm? That's interesting lol
1175 2018-12-17 21:52:37 *drowns self in essential oil*
1176 2018-12-17 21:52:32 Aleksandr Mişon Impossible: The Oil Gush in Balakhany
1177 2018-12-17 21:52:29 That's why GOP silent. They want to be like Russian oil-i-garchs.
1178 2018-12-17 21:52:28 I always say explore the five senses when trying to flesh out a scene!
Sound = motors, scraping of metal on metal, thud of footsteps.
Smell = oil, smoke, heated metal
Feel = vibrations, heat
Sight = colors, reactions from others
Taste = smoky air, metallic oily tinge to the air
1179 2018-12-17 21:52:28 Ladies, y’all don’t know when to get your oil changed?  and I’m not talking about going by the date/miles on the sticker in your window . .
1180 2018-12-17 21:52:23 ICYMI: The U.S. Just Became a Net Oil Exporter for the First Time in 75 Years

I'm sure it had nothing to do with our decreasing use of crude oil thanks to liberals' encouragement of alternative energy sources...
1181 2018-12-17 21:52:22 I'm sure he drinks Oil of Olay.
1182 2018-12-17 21:52:20 Keith sweat still uses pink oil moisturizer and pomade in his hair ...he boutta kill these Lil RNB new niggas
1183 2018-12-17 21:52:18 The continual sell off of the US stock market:

23 trillion in debt and rising, unsustainable tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations, unstable oil, unstable and corrupt President and interest rates that are still low.

The coming #TrumpRecession is going to be a whopper.
1184 2018-12-17 21:52:15 Any #naturalhealth #homeopaths #holistic folks here have any experience with blackseed oil? Tastes nasty, holding my nose and hoping for results.
1185 2018-12-17 21:51:57 Now I know how them oil spill ducks feel
1186 2018-12-17 21:51:57 Some sort of congealed nut oil? I was going to guess an old timey name for nut butter but the cooking instructions make me think not.
1187 2018-12-17 21:51:54 I made them! They’re actually supplements and part of their diet, not treats. The organ blend meets the organ requirement in the raw diet and the veggie is a blend of leafy greens, carrots, berries, apple cider vinegar, coconut oil & bone broth. Aids in digestion & adds vit & min
1188 2018-12-17 21:51:40 At 1st I thought it was gold coloured paint. Then I saw it is oil. Black gold. Not too far wrong lol. What did they say they wanted to achieve?
1189 2018-12-17 21:51:37 Oil finally done reaaaaaaly could have gone without dropping the filter
1190 2018-12-17 21:51:34 Neither of those groups have my interests in mind, neither of them want me to be able to freely exercise my individual rights as a citizen in what is supposedly a democracy. What is the meaningful distinction to me? Oil companies want to do worse things to me than the Russians.

1195 2018-12-17 21:51:00 Let me delete that.. They don’t even know when to get their oil changed but wanna discuss what car notes should be..
1196 2018-12-17 21:50:57 All Resistance BS anyway.

“Hey Vlad, great idea here! 
Instead of watching Hillary keep the restrictions on oil and gas, let’s help Trump and watch him lift them. 
It’ll drive up America’s exports and wreck our economy! 
We might even end up with a GDP even lower than LA Cty ”
1197 2018-12-17 21:50:55 Impierialists are supporting terrorism on the World! They want more Oil,$,Blood and Tears!
1198 2018-12-17 21:50:48 My adult Xmas list: pay for my oil change.
1199 2018-12-17 21:50:33 I use my chick pussy juice for my beard oil
1200 2018-12-17 21:50:00 Could be a blessing in disguise (wishful thinking) if the Saudi’s retaliate by cancelling oil sales to Canada!
1201 2018-12-17 21:49:59 Price of gas is going up with carbon tax. I would happily pay a premium for gas if I knew oil was being purchased here. Supporting jobs here. Long term it is good for the country.

1211 2018-12-17 21:48:49 You have a better chance of selling snake oil to  anyone with any grasp of healthcare economics. #MedicareForAll would be the worst move we could make for quality of medical care.....

1217 2018-12-17 21:48:13 Well it would be solved by a few hundred auto and oil execs walking into the sea

1222 2018-12-17 21:47:46 Premier, you do realize that Alberta isn’t the only place on the planet with oil and market price is determined by supply and demand.
1223 2018-12-17 21:47:46 Oil is my nemesis 
1224 2018-12-17 21:47:44 I get so nervous getting oil changes. The guy told me to turn on my blinker and all of a sudden I forgot how and did my wiper fluid instead 
1225 2018-12-17 21:47:33 Deborah are you really stupid enough to believe your govts oil and gas ban to be good policy?  "Good" meaning well researched with provable and measurable benefits to New Zealanders? Wake up!
1226 2018-12-17 21:47:30 You don't know the cost of the oil in my alabaster box...
1227 2018-12-17 21:47:29 Makeup wipes suck to me lol. I rather oil or Vaseline and a paper towel 
1228 2018-12-17 21:47:25 Are there any independent sources that keep track of all consumer products and publish real inflation numbers?  I suspect they are much higher than were being told.  Lower oil price will bring them down, but not to the same extent as crude discount.
1229 2018-12-17 21:47:24 I just wanted an oil change and now they having me pay for a filter change and sumn else. All this bouta be $150

Why promote palm when there is better? @feistyredhair @NatGeo

1260 2018-12-17 21:44:22 The bar outside Lucas Oil Stadium has the same thing. Super cool!
1261 2018-12-17 21:44:22 May could do with a Mediterranean diet full of olive oil to lubricant her hips robot  lolol
1262 2018-12-17 21:44:20 Nope. The people of Alberta deserve all the credit for forcing Rachel to suddenly pretend to be the great defender of Oil.

1264 2018-12-17 21:44:15 I heard recently that a bill was signed to make hemp (non high part of marijuana) legal so now farmers can grow it.  Helping places like Texas North Dakota to be able to get cbd oil. Have u heard about this
1265 2018-12-17 21:44:15 When the oil starts to pop off.
1266 2018-12-17 21:44:13 Go and learn tailoring or make up
1267 2018-12-17 21:44:10 What is al Shabab doing over there? They aren’t routing Christians and taking over swaths of territory right?  Like ISIS;  what were they doing in Iraq? Chillin, or taking over huge swaths of land? With land they control oil and taxes and their finances get massive. Then what?
1268 2018-12-17 21:44:02 It was what I thought.  He was saying oil prices are discounting a major recession that doesn't seem to be in the cards so he's bullish.
1269 2018-12-17 21:43:54 oil diffuser > candles, fight me.
1270 2018-12-17 21:43:49 Nope icpc because you're corrupt more than your age
1271 2018-12-17 21:43:45 I do not think his fund shutting or not will have any medium term influence on oil prices....
1272 2018-12-17 21:43:45 2013-2015 period when ISIS was in its powerful phase as #Erdogan was their main highway, you were silent & happy b/c they were massacring & opening a new gap for Turks to revive their ottoman dream. #Russia even shared a file with UN which was showing Turkish-ISIS oil trading.
1273 2018-12-17 21:43:35 Tech is the new oil.
1274 2018-12-17 21:43:33 Why would you cook with it? Does it come in an oil form? I’ve only seen pill form.

1277 2018-12-17 21:43:06 It's Math Monday! See if you can get today's problem: An oil company is drilling into the ground. Their machine starts 8 feet above the ground and drills at 4 feet per minute. How long will it take the machine to be 44 feet below the ground?

1280 2018-12-17 21:42:49 lassies are going HAM on these apps man their pics look like oil paintings, settle right doon, imagine sittin going to aw that effort to filter one pic, must take about an hour a pic, should put more effort into their driving 
1281 2018-12-17 21:42:44 Definitely somewhere between greed/delusion/denial with big oil right now...
1282 2018-12-17 21:42:43 Which "adulting" skill do high school students today need the most?

-Cooking at Home
-Budgeting/Finances/Credit
-Basic Auto Maintenance- Tires/Oil/ETC
-Controlling social media accounts.
1283 2018-12-17 21:42:40 It is bizarre to me that they are more comfortable bringing tankers full of crude across the Atlantic from foreign dictatorships than keeping Canadian dollars in the Canadian economy by piping in crude oil from the west; even more perplexing in light of steep transfer pmts to QC.
1284 2018-12-17 21:42:30 Maybe I could start my own radio station and discuss shares in

1285 2018-12-17 21:42:27 Like to see Alberta produce super cheap power from their oil, then offer to any US/China/Canadian manufacturers who want a real manufacturing advantage. Worked for Ont and Quebec in the 60's and 70's with hydro power.#alberta
1286 2018-12-17 21:42:23 The oil cannot change what you didn't plan for. Wasted years cannot be redemmed by oil
1287 2018-12-17 21:42:13 ITS SO EASY TOO LIKE JUST A BIT OF OLIVE OIL DRIZZLED AND SOME SEASONINGS FOR LIKE TEN MINUTES THATS IT AND ITS MY FAVORITE SIDE DISH EVER
1288 2018-12-17 21:42:11 Liberal Logic: There is no Social Acceptability for Alberta Oil to go to market. There is plenty of social acceptability to import oil from highly repressive regimes that dont have the same stringent standards we have.

Change is so desperately needed.

1293 2018-12-17 21:41:44 Public vs private mindset is so destructive. My hobbie horse is getting oil companies to go out of business ASAP. Why should that be left up to free markets? Why can’t government play a role in putting undesirable companies out of their misery?
1294 2018-12-17 21:41:43 Fell in Asda due to some dipshit spilling cooking oil on the floor and not cleaning it up. My knees are already covered in bruises and my bloody cauliflower cheese went fleeing half way down the aisle! FUMING

1304 2018-12-17 21:40:57 I had two great “layoffs” from elementary school:

Fall ‘84: head lice, right at start of MLB playoffs, 5-6 days off school

Such fond memories. Except for the hot oil hair treatments....

1310 2018-12-17 21:40:34 There’s a difference between grandstanding and making an ethical decision. He may still choose to block the importation of Saudi oil. It’s not like he had to pick one over the other. Canada has a lot to consider when making these decisions, not just economic.
1311 2018-12-17 21:40:27 AND we drill for oil in offshore oilfields off the coasts of NFLD and Nova Scotia, shipping hundreds of thousands of barrels/day from those wellheads to Eastern CDN refineries. Why there but not out west?
1312 2018-12-17 21:40:24 Let's call eastern imperialism of western oil by its proper name - oppression.
The colonies of AB & SK will seek their independence. History proves that when a group of people are oppressed, they will seek freedom!
1313 2018-12-17 21:40:22 I know many people in the oil industry and I will tell you right now,  they don't like Obama.
1314 2018-12-17 21:40:17 Wash everything and don’t share towels! Use lavender oil to aid rest and sleep.

1318 2018-12-17 21:39:51 They will when fossil fuels are finally removed from our society especially as the oil sands will be one of the first to go due to costs and dirtiness. Then, those pushing all this, will take the money they stole and run, leaving #Alberta to suffer.

1320 2018-12-17 21:39:47 So Schatzki/Stavins take some legitimate science, but fail to understand the context and arrive at the wrong conclusion.

I'd also point out that report was funded by the main Western oil industry lobbying group, who has a strong interest in cheap allowances. 11/11
1321 2018-12-17 21:39:44 That's one reason you need a man around. That and when you get your oil changed or car work done.
1322 2018-12-17 21:39:43 China wants to do the same to ours. If they convince some countries to take thier money over the American dollars. If Saudi Arabia decides to take China's money for oil. We will see the fallout here.
1323 2018-12-17 21:39:35 Means your leaking oil. 
1324 2018-12-17 21:39:35 Put way too much oil in my hair before work... not enough time to shower now it looks like I haven’t showered in 10 years

1329 2018-12-17 21:39:06 The stock market panic is caused by these things:
- Fed Reserve whisper they’re raising rates again.
- Saudi Arabia jacked up price of oil, may not be buying from USA in future. Russia more than happy to step in.
- Tremendous unrest in Europe...UK, Germany, France especially.

1330 2018-12-17 21:39:02 I told one girl never to talk to me again when she insulted me as we were arguing about this.
1331 2018-12-17 21:38:54 Well it's pretty much the same given the close relationship between the two countries and how dependent Canada is on the US for trade. Only difference is oil imho. It's a much bigger slice of the Canadian economic pie than for the US imho. CAD tracks Oil closely as result.
1332 2018-12-17 21:38:47  okay bet. Which one: All nighter or de-slick oil control ?
1333 2018-12-17 21:38:46 If a fire starts from one of those scented oils is still considered an oil fire??
1334 2018-12-17 21:38:41 I’m heading to micheals on Wednesday and picking up a bunch of canvases and restocking my oil paints 
1335 2018-12-17 21:38:37 Someone take my car to get its oil changed, thanks in advance.
1336 2018-12-17 21:38:35 Interesting that in 2008 oil started selling off five months the stock crash. It's an old trick the PPT uses to get the economy off the deck. Think free money for everyone aka ZIRP aka QE. @LukeGromen

1340 2018-12-17 21:38:16 I’ve planned to let myself jump into oil & mining industry. But i know my education background not really needed for its. Thats why, last few days i always search about graduate or management trainee program vacancy.

Allah hears me.
Many opportunities come across 
1341 2018-12-17 21:38:03 yes! dilute it, 1 part oil 1 part water & apply that directly to breakout

i had to do tht last night for this one big ass pimple on my face
1342 2018-12-17 21:37:47 And who controls the security agents.

Police? Civil defense? Military?
Do any of the state level heads of these institutions report to the State governor?

Still, you haven't answered my question: how is it safe to drill oil & gas but not to have a functioning seaport?

1359 2018-12-17 21:36:32 You assume a lot about Alberta's negotiating power. Let's remember the US can't get Keystone built and fracking production keeps rising. 

Alberta could shut off oil to BC. I also think you overestimate Alberta's bargaining position with an Alberta free Canada.

1365 2018-12-17 21:36:09 It was a gamble but it was worth it. There was a trillion dollar oil deal that could only happen if sanctions on Russia were lifted. During the campaign, Maria Butina asked him about the sanctions and trump immediately said that he didn’t think we needed the sanctions on Russia.

And commercialism won't save the planet, but a unified effort to change how global economies work will.

You also get the credit for running up national debt by about 2 T$, during the "best economy ever.

1382 2018-12-17 21:35:02 The oil industry support for carbon pricing is part of an attempt to establish a 'level playing field'. But there is no level playing field in the climate crisis: any fair accounting would decisively favour clean energy options.
1383 2018-12-17 21:34:52 1984-2004 oil futures priced $9-$40. some claim oil loses money at $50 in spite of technological advances that have cut price discovery and extraction 40% in most cases. how did IOC's survive $30 oil all those years? oil is abundant and cheap. #oott #we #see #u #lower #oil
1384 2018-12-17 21:34:48 All o&g drills are high risk
If you read that big oilers are calling some of the wells drilled in producing fields wildcats then you know it's high risk

Lets just say something similar to Balcombe+much worse when oil is water wet or no hc charge

~Zero risk is pre result ride
1385 2018-12-17 21:34:36 I do not think he will shutdown...He will hold on to the cash and jump back into oil when he thinks it is bottoming.
1386 2018-12-17 21:34:34 2/. Are you going to tell the Irving family that they should take our crude? Good luck! The two East Coast refineries both choose to use mostly foreign oil, based on price. They ship the refined product to the US NE and some is used in the Maritimes. Energy East is not viable. 
1387 2018-12-17 21:34:24 Unfortunately, the US Senate will regret it. We will stop exporting oil to your country and turn the arms deal to Russia and China. They are waiting for a signal from Saudi Arabia only, and your reckless decision is destroying your country's two economies

1391 2018-12-17 21:34:06 That seems counterintuitive, can you explain? Oil fuelled trains are more efficient than oil fuelled planes, why is the opposite true when electricity is the fuel?
1392 2018-12-17 21:34:02 It's our ridiculous media driving the cancel the contract thing instead of stop buying oil. Why in the hell would our media outlets want us to hurt Canadian workers, never mind the cost of cancelling.  Our politicians are too chicken to talk straight like Trump.

1394 2018-12-17 21:33:37 If oil and gas is so powerful why does it parrot talk through others especially from Houston
1395 2018-12-17 21:33:25 Irving and Irving only, buys Saudi oil. The government of Canada does not buy Saudi oil. No Saudi oil in Quebec or any other province.
1396 2018-12-17 21:33:23 Reading about the coup in Iran in 1953 is kinda infuriating. Britain and America set up a century of warfare and antagonism  because they couldn't bear the thought of paying for oil
1397 2018-12-17 21:33:14 made a oil, roasted chicken, and cucumber sandwich
1398 2018-12-17 21:33:14 When I fried up those mozerella sticks, I reignited the hot oil of war.
1399 2018-12-17 21:33:06 Let’s talk about resumes oil and gas on gulf coast.
1400 2018-12-17 21:33:00 tea tree oil?
1401 2018-12-17 21:32:59 Gas prices are set by world oil prices and not by anything Trump does. Ofcourse Trump has a lot of hot air
1402 2018-12-17 21:32:55 The only way he would ever visit a weatherspoons is if you promised him for dessert he could start an illegal oil war
1403 2018-12-17 21:32:48 just bought some oil recently & one of the strains is called Green Crack & idk i love that just wanted to share that lmao
1404 2018-12-17 21:32:47 I’ve left my hair pretty much alone for a month and I can tell the growth when I play in it. After the holidays it’s back to natural nothing but oil.
1405 2018-12-17 21:32:41 Oil and gas is a slow and durable technological genocide on a mass scale...

1407 2018-12-17 21:32:22 Keep freaking shut down all the American oil coal mines and everything off shore drilling he shut us down and now he wants to take credit I just don't see how he can do this with a straight face, Obama's on them drugs big time he's got to be back on them
1408 2018-12-17 21:32:08 Over the course of the next 6 years America will become energy independent and WE will become the world's largest exporter in oil that will wipe out National debt!  Those are GOD'S words not mine!!
1409 2018-12-17 21:31:52 He’s suggesting we build pipelines to bring our own oil to market and keep the money here.
1410 2018-12-17 21:31:42 I know people who have turned down jobs for arms dealers and oil companies. It is hard to do, but if you want to be able to live with yourself, then you have to do it. Future generations will thank you for it. The fate of our planet is in your hands. All you have to do is say no.
1411 2018-12-17 21:31:40 The best thing I ever use is steam. Good old fashioned boiled water in a pan and a towel over your head. It doesn't feel like it's helping at first but next day you are golden. You can put whatever you need in the water like some tea tree oil.
1412 2018-12-17 21:31:35 They slinked into retirement because they were the initiators of all that along with some donors in the oil and gas industry. Add in their Russian affairs an you have Congressional traitors who bought a presidency to create a scapegoat so they could escape. Cowards.
1413 2018-12-17 21:31:25 Binge watching what must be a new program called the “Beverly hillbillies.” See the way this rolls out is, A bunch of hillbillies strike it rich in the oil business and move to Beverly Hills. Hilarity ensue‘s. That Irene Ryan was a genius.
1414 2018-12-17 21:31:20 In no order:

- onions and garlic frying in olive oil
- fresh basil
- clean sheets dried outside
- spicy cooked fruit that smells like Christmas (mice pies, Christmas cake/pudding etc)

1419 2018-12-17 21:31:03 She might prefer that children storm the doors of oil executives than they NOT do that, but it’s a mute point, bc (1) who cares — free thought, free speech and (2) neither she nor anyone can reasonably conclude that her tweet would cause that. That tweet is a non-issue!

1423 2018-12-17 21:30:52 Damn, out of four only one works? That's definitely not good, mate. Hopefully, the oil leak on the camper van gets fixed soon!
1424 2018-12-17 21:30:49 five minute oil change really 20 mins yea
1425 2018-12-17 21:30:37 Your free from mince pies contain palm oil so I'm going to go with lettuce
1426 2018-12-17 21:30:31 What's coconut butter? 
The oil is solid and white so maybe that's  the butter you're talking about? Rose water is good for toning but I feel it helps keep the moisture in by tightening the skin. Almond oil is great but I love my coconut oil bc I also use it for cooking 
1427 2018-12-17 21:30:29 People defending oil are like dinosaurs and the meteor that crashed on earth is awareness and knowledge.

1437 2018-12-17 21:29:47 Just to bust this terrible fake information. Oil exploration didn’t happen in Somalia till the mid 2000s. Reagan’s presidency ended in 1989, and he passed in 2004. Somalia Civil is happening because the government rule the south and the militant terrorist groups rule the north.
1438 2018-12-17 21:29:35 Amazon is selling motor oil 
1439 2018-12-17 21:29:27 1/ jkenney ,we already ship 300,000 barrels a day to PQ, thru Line 9 to be refined in Montreal. The East Refineries are in Nfld. and  in NB, Canada’s largest refinery, Irving. It’s family owned, so they choose to keep buying Saudi Oil and a bit of our crude they bring in by rail
1440 2018-12-17 21:29:27 just found out Bob Ross used to use oil paints and my heart is broken
1441 2018-12-17 21:29:18 Check the label. Palm Oil is in MANY MANY items. Do not buy.

Semi-played-out wells there and in nearby Petrolia are ripe for fracking to release trapped oil.

That would allow this Ontario oil to be easily shipped to Montreal via oil tanker.

Canada East pipeline, anyone?

1461 2018-12-17 21:27:30 You really think a pipeline is what’s holding it back from getting to market?? Or is it going to reduce producer costs to get to foreign market?  Anyway you slice this the workers are going to get fucked in the long run.  The oil companies are taking the bag themselves
1462 2018-12-17 21:27:29 Ahead of the coming #EIAReport, the US Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR) shed 463,000 barrels over the past week down to 649.1 million; also down by 14.5M for 2018. This is taxpayer oil that is sold to commercial entities; hence added to commercial storage/use. #OOTT
1463 2018-12-17 21:27:29 I contacted the company.  Part of their convoluted answer... “Kellogg has been committed to responsibly sourcing palm oil since 2009.” “Roundtable of Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO)”..not buying it, or Kellogg’s.

1472 2018-12-17 21:26:38 i still maintain that if you want to stop a pipeline you go after the consultants and contractors. oil firms Don't Care they have Never Cared, but if you kick up a fuss and lawsuits against smaller firms they'll be forced to listen and potentially back out

1486 2018-12-17 21:25:39 You are being paid  by George Soros to try to ban King Oil to build up the solar panels  and wind mill business. Oil is a $2 trillion a year business. For 5 weeks now there as been  riots in Paris over the French gov. trying to go up on gas taxes by 63% .
1487 2018-12-17 21:25:33 So oil for heating isn't what you are after?

1492 2018-12-17 21:25:10 When will EU and NATO act? Have we learned nothing from appeasing the Nazis? Russia will continue its invasions, cyber attacks, and assassinations if we keep hoping the Tsar will stop. He views this as weakness. Increase sanctions! Stop providing them with revenue! No oil or sas!
1493 2018-12-17 21:25:06 Changed my own oil and sweated my ass off at the track, so far so good. 
1494 2018-12-17 21:25:06 Billions in big oil taxpayer funded subsidies & they show you gratitude by massive layoffs & walking away w/record profits. gee, let’s go back for more punishment. If you ever left your #CONman “the sky is falling!” echo chamber, you’d know separation is not a common topic.
1495 2018-12-17 21:24:53 Not until it makes it to Montreal and disrupts a few oil tankers from unloading.
1496 2018-12-17 21:24:52 There will soon be a naft deal ending up with Syrian State ownership of all oil, pocketed by the filthy rich syrian nice face elite families, fair enough...
1497 2018-12-17 21:24:39 And? So that entire 113 page list is anti-oil? People can donate wherever they want. I'm so sick of people treating oil like it's an untouchable god. It's needed and we should work for a pipeline but now no one can take money from a place if it also gives money to anti-oil? Geez

1501 2018-12-17 21:24:02 Science has been done on algae biofuels and it’s not environmentally viable or scalable to the size of the economy supported. Canada alone imported 800k bpd of oil yesterday not even including the millions we produce..
1502 2018-12-17 21:23:59 The last issue you attribute to Trump, increases in domestic Oil & Gas production, has nothing to do with him. These increases are due to revolutionary technology, & the fact Texas, ND, & PA are outside State Dem control. Thankfully CA was not the only region this could be done.
1503 2018-12-17 21:23:57 6000 quality jobs to be lost here &lives ruined, while PM forces us to fund their country by buying their oil yet cries about 2300 lost jobs in a dying industry in Oshawa. Not to mention the 15,000  immediate direct, and untold indirect, jobs from building the pipeline.
1504 2018-12-17 21:23:55 What a very one sided, nonsensical response. Trudeau approved more pipelines than Harper and even bought one to help Alberta and the oil & gas sector. (Yes it will take time to build it). Stop with this incredible BS, and start telling people the truth.
1505 2018-12-17 21:23:22 Duh!
Of course you're right!

1512 2018-12-17 21:22:01 But I think he is flat oil. He only lost 5pct in November which is a lot better than oil itself so he may have already liquidated everything.

1519 2018-12-17 21:21:46 The electric vehicle crowd is full of techies. So we have jargon: EVs vs ICEs (internal combustion engines). But I think having an "ICE" car sounds kinda cool. Maybe we should be more direct and ask, do you have an "electric car" or do you still have an "oil car" ?
1520 2018-12-17 21:21:35 It’s shameful that you put workers futures in jeopardy by doubling down on this sunset industry. I saw kids at the protest holding signs “I wanna work the oil sands like dad.” Look at the dissonance you’re fostering. Do you think that kid will have a job in this dying industry?
1521 2018-12-17 21:21:34 Your tweet appeared in my feed. 

Fair enough. Was the pump itself faulty? This will sound patronising AF but do you know how to check your oil and change a tyre? Essential skills for a new car owner :)
1522 2018-12-17 21:21:29 Your own chart shows Oil & Gas PPI is now back to 2004 levels, meanwhile the Consumer Price Index is up 33% since then. Sounds like a real productivity improvement to me!
1523 2018-12-17 21:21:28 Still going through the thread,  all the tax revenues from whisky, farming, oil, gas and renewables would come to a Scottish Treasury to invest in education, health and infrastructure.

1527 2018-12-17 21:21:10 The key moment was PMJT refusing to answer why Canada imports oil from Saudi Arabia.
1528 2018-12-17 21:20:52 Justin Trudeau and of course some #Democrats has endorsed the idea to stop arm sales to Saudi Arabia
Just how many firearm, aviation equipment, and heavy arterial companies are there in Canada?? And how many barrels of oil do they buy a year??
Yea, that’s what I thought
1529 2018-12-17 21:20:51 Your account is aptly named.  It's too bad you have no conscience, and choose to promote junk science to help oil execs make short-term profits at an incalculable cost to humanity.
1530 2018-12-17 21:20:51 Economic growth in Ukraine is outpacing Russia, and this a country without much oil and gas.  And seriously, would you invest your money is Russia nowadays?
1531 2018-12-17 21:20:49 How can you complain about gas prices when y’all “left siders” wanna stop drilling for oil?!? Wtf don’t think that’s gonna do to the price
1532 2018-12-17 21:20:43 My vehicle has a Christmas list..4 new tires and an oil change...ha...maybe next Christmas....maybe...bah humbug

1534 2018-12-17 21:20:37 Why would Putin want Trump to win ? For strong America? For oil, gas, coal producing America? For America NEVER selling uranium? For America protecting friends? For America - strong and rich? Why this is GOOD for Putin?! The answer is- COMPLETE IDIOCY. Putin needed Hitlery !!!
1535 2018-12-17 21:20:22 AND THEN when the moisturizer/oil just hits the wrong part of ur forehead u get like 50 pimples which is probably what happened the other month when my eye got infected. can one live
1536 2018-12-17 21:20:20 So how about the rest? The Saudis ship 90,000 bbl/day into Eastern Canada! All of that should be replaced with Cdn oil! All of it. #EnergyEast would do it.
1537 2018-12-17 21:20:06 If oil and gas production continues to increase at current rates, it will be nearly impossible for #Canada to meet its #ParisAgreement targets. #climateaction #fossilfreehttp://ow.ly/r0IH30mXWPd

1541 2018-12-17 21:19:54 Just copped some Castor Oil. Y’all should be scared
1542 2018-12-17 21:19:49 I heard if you rub a Igbo girls forehead with oil, you can see your future.
1543 2018-12-17 21:19:45 I’m over here getting this oil change when really I just wanna be at home in my bed
1544 2018-12-17 21:19:35 Surely you are talking about Palestinians and the Arab world?! Palestinians get aid from UN, EU, UK, France, Kuwait. They come to Israel to work. And the Arab world has what? Oil that the US found. Israel has oranges, Kosher food, Hi Tech.
1545 2018-12-17 21:19:31 Online shopping is dangerous. I just ordered $200 worth of shit while waiting for my oil to be changed
1546 2018-12-17 21:19:26 isnt that what you just did? american oil magnates mean you no harm :)

1551 2018-12-17 21:18:49 And getting there oil from unethical countries
1552 2018-12-17 21:18:48 Ima keep digging until I find Oil 
1553 2018-12-17 21:18:48 They subvert a multi billion dollar industries of hemp all for the 1℅ profit while poisoning our air and water when we could have fuel, paper and plastic made from hemp, they know it has medical need but oil companies boast how they work with the medical monopoly & Arabs
1554 2018-12-17 21:18:42 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
1555 2018-12-17 21:18:32 The only explanation for current high rate of subsidy for fuel above or equal to when oil/was $100 and pump price N 87 is if the number of vehicles or usage increase, the question is have number of cars and generators significantly increased in the last 3 years ?
1556 2018-12-17 21:18:19 Hunter nodded to the male slowly walking up to the selves he picked out some vibrant blues and reds, he picked the best colours he could find. Only the best for his best friends.

"Sorry baby. I think these would be great!"

Premium oil paints.
1557 2018-12-17 21:18:00 The barber was trying forever to find a way to cover the bald area!  Without success, of course!  That’s why Eric’s hair looks so greasy - all that oil or wax product he’s using to try to keep the combover in place... 
1558 2018-12-17 21:18:00 “ Value of pipelines is in lowering transportation costs, not displacing imports.” It was intimated SA oil was not used in Quebec and that the differential could not be displaced by getting better value to the east. SA charges full Brent rates to Canada.
1559 2018-12-17 21:17:54 We need a strategy to sell Que. Why don't they get it? Cut off Saudi imports. Less supertankers. Using Cdn oil produced with stringent environmental safeguards. Ditto the pipeline - built & operated by Cdns. More Govt revenue; reduce deficits; fund equalization & social services
1560 2018-12-17 21:17:52 #wallstreet sell-off was brutal. S&P closes at 14 month low. US Treasuries up. Junk bond spreads are widest they's been for two-years. Oil tumbles with WTI down nearly 4%. Risk-off leading into the Fed meeting a big-factor, but this is a market preparing for economic slow down.
1561 2018-12-17 21:17:45 So we pay them ~$300MM per month for oil, but we’re gonna “take a stand” on this?
1562 2018-12-17 21:17:36 "Deputy Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, a former lobbyist for the oil, gas and water industries is poised to become acting secretary following President Donald Trump'sannouncement Saturday that [Interior Secretary Ryan] Zinke will leave by the end of the year. POLITICO.
1563 2018-12-17 21:17:30 Just like those wealthy folks who sign on to the liberal agenda to escape the pitchfork-carrying rabble at their gates, apparently the oil companies are also seeking favor...

1565 2018-12-17 21:17:21 Dammit, I forgot to get an oil change this weekend. 
1566 2018-12-17 21:17:20 I've heard of that in the news, didn't really see any of that money though. 
You can see the oil revenue in Gaddafi's complex and houses

1568 2018-12-17 21:16:51 George Soros  is paying this little girl to say what she says about Oil .For 5 weeks there have been  riots in Paris over the gov. tried to increase gas taxes by 63% .Do we want rioting here too .

1572 2018-12-17 21:16:18 Guess we have "black" gold in lieu of actual! I've owned apt. properties in Cdn. oil country for 25 years so I guess I'll be OK. This is all very complicated stuff. Again appreciate people like you, Luke and Brent sharing your knowledge on a daily basis. 
1573 2018-12-17 21:16:15 I'm convinced we won't see a bottom in oil until Andurand's fund shuts down. The last time we saw the bottom in oil was when Andy Hall shut his fund down. #oott
1574 2018-12-17 21:16:15 Crude Oil from $76 to under $50 per barrel since October.
1575 2018-12-17 21:16:07 don't forget to mention OIL.they said they discovered it too
1576 2018-12-17 21:15:58 Saying that Alberta needs to stop relying on the gas and oil industry is rich coming from people that had thier parents and family hand them everything in life that was funded by thier jobs IN THE INDUSTRY YOU HATE SO MUCH. I say if they feel that way, pay back you family.
1577 2018-12-17 21:15:50 He probably believes the Bakken shale oil boom and all the fracking that was going on during his administration were his doing.

1580 2018-12-17 21:15:32 All the kids I went to bible camp with now have a husband named Trevor, 5 children, and a booming essential oil empire.

1582 2018-12-17 21:15:29 On June 8, 1989, you launched the Trump Shuttle, right before a recession & oil price hike.

On April 7, 1992, the Trump Shuttle ceased to exist when USAir took over operations because you defaulted on $135 million of the shuttle's debt. But first you broke a deal with Northwest.
1583 2018-12-17 21:15:29 Days like this in the #market , oil@is traded as a risk asset. No surprise that it’s at lows of the year. 
The global growth forecast is 3.7%. NOT a bad thing, slightly lower than previously expected. No bad news here #MarketMoves #CNBC #oil
1584 2018-12-17 21:15:28 You are a charlatan who’s been completely wrong about the productivity of unconventional oil and gas. Delete your account.
1585 2018-12-17 21:15:27 @Sqwii are you still bullish on oil turning around?
1586 2018-12-17 21:15:27 It's essential council sets the right tone for pay negotiations with city staff.

While many Calgarians have had pay cuts, or even lost their jobs, city staff pay is up 17% since the oil downturn.

A pay freeze is the absolute minimum required for council and staff.

1593 2018-12-17 21:14:41 On the other side of the world, why has #RodrigoDuterte signed a pact with #China for oil exploration in the #SouthChinaSea and other disputed territories? Is Duterte trying to get rich with Black Gold? #Philippines
1594 2018-12-17 21:14:38 eternal bill.  

Same with carbon tax.  IF they were serious, the industry in NL would have a tax to pay as well, they do not. Free pass for the oil and gas sector.  So another liberal idea, will serve the conservatives down the road in a much bigger way.
1595 2018-12-17 21:14:34 And the vegetable/palm oil makes it sooo much cheaper for the manufacturer...purely coincidental, obviously... #insidethefactory
1596 2018-12-17 21:14:27 Look at how much the Oil and Gas lobby pumps into the pockets of Utah legislators and it won't be nearly as mind boggling.

1598 2018-12-17 21:14:12 AHA! So that $40k is part of the Illuminati globalist Soros-funded conspiracy to land lock Albertan Oil (except for all the pipelines heading south). Man you are good! #ableg
1599 2018-12-17 21:14:08 While you're at it, maybe you could give me the name of the financial institution that did the banking for ISIS oil sales and who funded and armed them though? Maybe even name the cargo airline and ship that hauled the weapons? I'll wait

1604 2018-12-17 21:12:49 Wow what of monthly share of oil proceeds?
1605 2018-12-17 21:12:46 When @GEJonathan  was president average oil price was $100 and petrol pump price was N97 and later reduced to N87, yet fuel subsidy payment was not as much now when oil price is average of $60 and pump price of N145. I understand this our current integrity government

1620 2018-12-17 21:11:32 The oil economy pays royalties on a performance basis. It does not need to pay further taxes while underperforming to meet Trudeau’s over spending. Trudeau must be reminded infrastructure is funded by business and in the East taxes killed all prospect of viability. #cdnpoli

1630 2018-12-17 21:11:02 You don't delve deep enough. Up until now, the tight oil plays have been negative cashflow. This year about 20% of them were about to go positive for the first time. But then the price dropped this late fall early winter. The only thing delaying AB O&G investment is @RachelNotley
1631 2018-12-17 21:11:00 She wanted to be savage. Allah dai ya kyauta.
1632 2018-12-17 21:10:54 QC doesn't import Saudi oil. 

They mostly import US oil at the full world price while the west sells it to the US for a low price.  This is costing Canada tens of millions per day.

1640 2018-12-17 21:10:01 Careful with industry, though, since this could be a variety of products unrelated to their output (office supplies imported by an oil and gas firm, etc etc). At the landing page, there is a 'search by product' option in stead.
1641 2018-12-17 21:09:48 Sitting at the dealership getting an oil change.. stuck in a room with a lady coughing up a lung and an older gentleman sleeping while his alarm is continuously playing.. yay me! Guess it’s just a typical Monday!

1645 2018-12-17 21:09:40 Now Ms Negative Sara Eisen who hates Trump is bringing up the Trump Trade as she gleefully smiles.  She is worst announcer on any financial channel.  Certainly no Maria Bartiromo, not even close.  Why do I even watch CNBC?
1646 2018-12-17 21:09:37 Oh shit, that just happened in my house

Where have you been all my life?

We could burn the midnight oil together
1647 2018-12-17 21:09:32 I was thinking of using the raw deckle (and other fats) trimmed from brisket and pork butts as the flavor base, and maybe adding more oil/lard as needed to get a deep-fry.  Then make regular beignets in it, sprinkle with powdered sugar. If I try for Xmas .. I'll upload pics.
1648 2018-12-17 21:09:32 Remember in Feb 2016 when everyone ABSOLUTELY adamant oil going to $10 ( press /SKY/Bloomberg etc)....when oil was dicing with death at $29/28/27/25....???...  went on biggest bull run in 10yrs.....just saying

1652 2018-12-17 21:09:14 Hmm.

GOP voting Seniors LOVE Medicare

& Congress gets Govt paid medical options
& Military med bills paid by Govt.

& GOP Govt safety net for oil/banks/farmers/coal miners medical is OK?

& for profit prisons medical paid by US Taxes too...

Medicare for all works as option.

1654 2018-12-17 21:09:09 How about trying Rick Simpson oil, which reportedly has cured stage four cancer WITH FAR MORE SUCCESS THAN THE MEDICAL SYSTEM. However, you might not love your wife enough to even try that.
1655 2018-12-17 21:08:57 they wanted to emotionally blackmail the guy
she wanted to be righteous
1656 2018-12-17 21:08:41 I’ve been chillin at the mechanics for an hour and a half. FOR A DAMN OIL CHANGE
1657 2018-12-17 21:08:39 Real #treatyourself kind of day - oil change, car wash, and the DMV.
1658 2018-12-17 21:08:32 Not sure how that's a reasonable conclusion to draw. The motion was about supporting oil and gas specifically and the challenges facing it. Has nothing to do with other energy technology which I'm sure they all heavily support.
1659 2018-12-17 21:08:26 AOC. Did you know most of the Canadiens come to the USA for their MR Scan, CT...etc. you have so much to learn. Norway is the closest country to match our healthcare. The country pays with the oil Revenue. Who invents the drugs. The technology...America
1660 2018-12-17 21:08:15 Well I think you'll be pleased to know that one of our account managers lost a lot of weight on keto and used CBD oil to get her through the "keto flu" 
1661 2018-12-17 21:08:11 Invest in some neem oil. It’s the best safest, most natural form of bc 

When u coming back?
1662 2018-12-17 21:07:44 Can oil continue to go down without a drop in demand?

Supply & Demand is no longer matters in our world where Governments in collusion with banks are the largest traders in the world using High Frequency Trading. Price discovery is dead, Uptick Rule is dead, Rule of Law is dead.
1663 2018-12-17 21:07:33 @CostaCoffee Hello. Can you tell me where you source your palm oil from which are found in your products such as the chocolate brownie?
1664 2018-12-17 21:07:28 Oil and eating animals. Unless we stop both completely we’re doomed.
1665 2018-12-17 21:07:13 Interesting how Appalachia is still eating through its inventory of DUC wells. Obviously local prices have mattered ...and now we see that the same story will likely unfold, with several years delay, for oil in the Permian...

1667 2018-12-17 21:06:58 As someone who tries living organically and holistically, can we please try to agree on which oils are safe to cook with! Though I've never cooked with coconut oil, just read something that claims coconut oil is good for you and aids in weight loss.
1668 2018-12-17 21:06:55 Stop buying Indian, goods, giving India diplomatic cover at the UN and embargo the oil sales. Anything less is just the normal mutterings.
1669 2018-12-17 21:06:52 That speech reeks of entitlement. If Alberta had not put all their chips in the oil pot & perhaps planned ahead for a time when they couldn’t rely on the oil industry showering them in money, maybe they wouldn’t be in this predicament. #reapwhatyousow #poorplanning
1670 2018-12-17 21:06:52 Given that the majority of the Syrian army is Sunni !!! I suspect the Rothschild backed economist is totally full of shit, blood and oil from the stolen golan !!

1674 2018-12-17 21:06:30 CBD oil is this year’s keto and next year’s Gluten.
1675 2018-12-17 21:06:09 I use the lanolin oil I got for sore nursing nipples on my dry lips. Whatever works!
1676 2018-12-17 21:06:07 @GretaThunberg There no such thing as climate change. We are having the same weather here in Texas ever since I was a child. This thing of climate change is a  hoax of the left wanting to build up business for sun solar panels and wind mills. King Oil is a $2 trillion a year bus.
1677 2018-12-17 21:06:04 People shamelessly want to drag people and expect a soft landing, was she expecting a Smooth clap back? She really deserve what she got wallah. After you deal with them they'll now want to emotionally blackmail you, looking fr unnecessary sympathy.
1678 2018-12-17 21:05:42 Lmfaoo that’s me using oil at night
1679 2018-12-17 21:05:41 If you from the south and have to say any word ending in “oil”, that’s when that drawl REALLY jumps out.
1680 2018-12-17 21:05:39 It’s not just the “elites” that are worried. And the biggest elites are the ones making the most money from pollution causing things like big oil and chemicals. But just the left have elites right? 
1681 2018-12-17 21:05:26 Before oil money.. came trickiling in
1682 2018-12-17 21:05:25 How about Trudeau go after oil imports?
1683 2018-12-17 21:05:22 Real genius in confronting Chinese trade deficit with trying to push oil below breakeven.
1684 2018-12-17 21:05:18 Hey bernie, your beloved county, Canada, is yelling and complaining that they are importing more oil than ever. Doesn't France a in issue with politicians that want to raise taxes? Hope I get a yellow vest for Christmas. Merry Christmas.
1685 2018-12-17 21:05:17 Can you name ONE Democrat in Congress or one Hollywood elite who DOESN'T have at least ONE OIL STOCK in their investment portfolios?

Cue the JEOPARDY music...
1686 2018-12-17 21:05:15 Big oil wouldn’t be so butt hurt about the cut on oil and gas if they would have just been providing safe renewable energy to our community this whole time.
1687 2018-12-17 21:05:14 Quebec doesn't purchase any saudi oil. Look it up.
1688 2018-12-17 21:04:57 Peppermint oil on the neck and shoulders will cool you right down.
1689 2018-12-17 21:04:36 Nope. Frei oil
1690 2018-12-17 21:04:33 I totally agree.  I’m officially NOT voting to re elect him.  Might just not vote period.  He has demolished his presidency because of his hard on for low oil prices.  Sad!
1691 2018-12-17 21:04:30 Antique Mobile oil sign about 3 foot radius in size. Great condition.
1692 2018-12-17 21:04:30 Excellent article 
The strong dollar is keeping oil prices from recovering, and will continue to suffer as long as we have a strong $$$$
1693 2018-12-17 21:04:28 Dropped the filter into the nasty oil and splashed myself good
1694 2018-12-17 21:04:27 I completely agree. Look at him now. Trying to take credit for everything. Even the oil production! The ones that produced he couldn’t regulate! 
1695 2018-12-17 21:04:27 Socks, undershirts, oil change that I don't have to do myself. And probably a new wallet or pair of work boots.
1696 2018-12-17 21:04:14 U.S. diplomats hold talks with Taliban on ending Afghanistan war: WATCH Y'ALL'S AZZES TALIBANS, YOU ABOUT TO GIT A PHUK'N FROM OUR CROOKED PHUK'N REPUBLICUNT FINANCIAL & "OIL" CORP "KOCH"-SUKKAS !!
1697 2018-12-17 21:04:01 Muzarabani oil is gonna bring chaos
1698 2018-12-17 21:03:57 Cancel this deal, put Canadians out of work, shut down all pipeline projects,  continue to purchase Saudi oil.

1702 2018-12-17 21:03:32 WTI crude settled below $50/barrel today for the first time since Oct. 9, 2017, Brent below $59. "Oil is on track for a third straight monthly decline despite efforts by OPEC, Russia and other major exporters to halt the slide." via @anussbaum1 #oil #airlines
1703 2018-12-17 21:03:30 Tea tree oil has changed my life for the better
1704 2018-12-17 21:03:30 an oil
1705 2018-12-17 21:03:30 The problem is whether the futures market looks at Brent and WTI for their quality or see it just as a benchmark. Most people never see the physical crude and may just see as a homogeneous barrel of crude oil.
1706 2018-12-17 21:03:27 Tai-Power says the number one reactor at the Third Nuclear Power Plant has been shut down for maintenance after an alarm went off indicating that lubricant oil levels for the reactor's cooling pump motor were too low.
1707 2018-12-17 21:03:23 TRP is what? So many acronyms. 
And thanks for sharing the burden of informing certain folks that PMJT does not decide where oil is purchased, and oil companies do.

1711 2018-12-17 21:02:46 Really a punt here now but smaller long $OIL above 4948 low
1712 2018-12-17 21:02:41 Hey chip companies I get that it’s 2018 and you wanna be cool and healthy and use coconut oil. Please stop. I am allergic and I miss chips. Be healthy with a different oil.
1713 2018-12-17 21:02:39 Bold Prediction 2019:

-Juul Fix’s it’s FDA issues
-IPO Late 2019
-Begins Production of Cannabis Oil Pods

Thoughts?
1714 2018-12-17 21:02:36 QC already has a massive surplus of hydroelectricity but it can’t replace cheap Saudi oil in certain areas. Renewables aren’t cost effective or practical in certain energy intensive industries or activities.  

Cdn oil has better chance of being replaced by more SA oil in East.
1715 2018-12-17 21:02:31 WELL SHE DID — I mean, she tried not getting pizza oil on their hair, or any part of her body, besides — she wanted to give hugs, they are complete afterall.

1718 2018-12-17 21:02:24 Yep contains orange oil and oranges are fruit
1719 2018-12-17 21:02:16 My car told me that an oil change is required 
1720 2018-12-17 21:02:11 Yesss Intox! I need to get back at it. Also all My nail fetish sells really well on IWC. Clicking them together, tapping, rubbing oil on cuticles, soothing mesmerizing voice. Money.
1721 2018-12-17 21:02:07 Really? So u just throw ur hands up & say 'it can't b done'? U would rather accept Saudi oil w its bone saw, human rights & women's rights records? Instead of building a country that is self sufficient & could export our values 2 the world? Really? Talk about blather #cdnpoli
1722 2018-12-17 21:02:04 Lesson learned..... throw used oil away......
1723 2018-12-17 21:02:03 Oil closes below $50 per barrel and Nigeria government is still dependent on the proceeds of oil as the major source of revenue for the country. “Sit down there make pant dey wear una” other emerging countries have diversified  long time ago but we still dey hold on to oil.
1724 2018-12-17 21:02:02 Twitters algorithm apparently thinks that I'm interested in oil. I am but not in the way that it thinks.
1725 2018-12-17 21:01:54 $NBEV When you see snake oil.  That's desperation in play.  Morning gap up squeeze in play.
1726 2018-12-17 21:01:52 Again, it's not that the Oil got penalties, they deserved them. But Oilers certainly should have got some.
1727 2018-12-17 21:01:44 You're right enough -- cyclical theory should hold and shit oil prices will eventually drive demand up & production down - then the cycle repeats. But where is the new floor/ceiling? I'd argue lower across the board. Supply rules.
1728 2018-12-17 21:01:26 Oh that can really skew things? I’ve taken a smaller dip long on $OIL again just above its lows on weekly here
1729 2018-12-17 21:01:25 If getting out of the contract can't happen then at least Canada can assert that going forward, we won't stand for Saudi aggression and lawlessness and no new deals will happen, no oil bought, until old crime networks accounted for, the guilty prosecuted.
1730 2018-12-17 21:01:23 I saw at least 3 missed calls on 97 last night and this is coming from a Nucks fan. 

Kozari shouldn’t be allowed to call oil games.. Van had the same problem with Auger for years.
1731 2018-12-17 21:01:19 Dont give him the idea to ban oil tanker on st lawrence please. ...
1732 2018-12-17 21:01:10 should have kept my old car oil change high now fuck 
1733 2018-12-17 21:01:01 OMG! Hahahaha...looks like it’s just oil & oh man their baby faces are apologizing big time & pleading for mercy hahahahaha so funny
1734 2018-12-17 21:00:56 Hrm .. maybe, but I was thinking a little more like deep fried like donuts instead of like Yorkshire pudding.  Kind of a donut / beingnet that tastes like bbq meat from the frying fat (maybe mixing with lard or oil if not enough).  Idk .. mostly thinking aloud .. thank you !
1735 2018-12-17 21:00:45 I mean I work in education so I’m using a lot but that’s not necessarily the norm lol. I learned how to calculate tax/tip/etc., change a tire, change oil, etc. all from my mom and dad really before I got to the point where I needed to use it though if that makes sense.
1736 2018-12-17 21:00:41 how come there's no circuit breaker with oil
1737 2018-12-17 21:00:38 Well oil rig job it is it’ll be good getting away for 5 weeks
1738 2018-12-17 21:00:38 Bata dai kyauta ba. People need to know the kinds of individuals they engage with.

1740 2018-12-17 21:00:37 Will Trudeau send the Cdn navy to stop oil tankers going from Alaska to the US west coast under his tanker ban? @Energy_Citizens #abpoli Many oil tankers traverse the east coast - does Justin not care about Atlantic Canada? @TheRebelTV #cdnpoli

1759 2018-12-17 20:59:06 Yes! Oil and coal, that's the future! Air-pollution in your lungs and micro-plastics in your kids. Who did this propaganda guy last work for? Kodak? Total tax take 2017/18 was $75.6 billion. His $500-600 mill is 0.79% of that. As if sunrise industries won't rise to fill that hole
1760 2018-12-17 20:59:05 Oil
1761 2018-12-17 20:58:53 But their veto of Energy East eliminates our ability to replace the Saudi oil coming in to CANADA. And it removes our ability to replace Saudi oil in world markets. Not a big ask, IMO.

1777 2018-12-17 20:57:03 Yes the Keystone pipeline needs to be done. All those who complain about it drive their cars around complaining loving all the luxuries produced oil provides. Shallow.
1778 2018-12-17 20:57:02 LOL OMG! That's exactly what it looks like!!!!!! 
Well, I never bought glass penguins but I just checked an oil dispenser I bought; close but no cigar. One is too small and the other too large.
1779 2018-12-17 20:57:02 You seem be allergic to the truth. Bad DOJ IT systems hamper all kinds of things. Text messages were recovered from backups. You, sir, are a con repping another con man. It feels like nesting Russian dolls of dishonest snake oil salesmen.

1785 2018-12-17 20:56:24 The oil going to Irving in NB is way more important, where are those refined barrels going ... better question with a much different answer. That refinery has Saudi feedstock for sure. Disingenuous to claim Quebec is not importing Saudi Oil.
1786 2018-12-17 20:56:18 oil拾いたかったけどxm出金して5万ぐらいからまた始めようとしてたから証拠金たりんかった
1787 2018-12-17 20:56:16 I hope my time of the month is almost over cause the amount of oil that’s been on my face is ridiculous.
1788 2018-12-17 20:55:58 a lot of the non dairy options are hugely problematic for the environment, animals including bees and wildlife we don’t even consume, and laborers (almond milk, palm oil, etc). research any brand before buying.
1789 2018-12-17 20:55:47 The Green Party had been offering the Green New Deal for years. Suddenly the capitalist democrat party co-opts it and people suddenly want it. Dems will never allow it to actually impact big oil. 

YOU COULD HAVE VOTED GREEN.
1790 2018-12-17 20:55:46 A list of communities that deplores oil would be handy. I don’t want to waste my fuel to visit these places.
1791 2018-12-17 20:55:43 Oil going to triple digits and CAD and Oil tend go in the same direction. All currencies will be devalued imho, including CAD, so Canadian home prices go higher, at least in nominal terms.
1792 2018-12-17 20:55:42 would you support us-backed self-described socialist groups like MEK and YRK in Iran if the US invaded the country with their support and started establishing bases there to seize the country’s oil just because Iran is not socialist? That’s essentially what is happening in Syria
1793 2018-12-17 20:55:41 Frogs and toads are the same animal! They just shapeshift! Greyhound buses don’t run on gasoline, they run on melted greyhound dogs! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
1794 2018-12-17 20:55:39 Yep all we need is another pretty face establishment Dem owned by corporations to give us the old snake oil salesmen bait and switch Obama 2.0. Still waiting on my change over here must be in the lobbyists couch. . .
1795 2018-12-17 20:55:33 My advice is nothing short of innovation. Anything beyond that and he’d have to refer to coconut oil Twitter . I’m really just putting him onto some ideas 
1796 2018-12-17 20:55:33 It always amazes me that everyone likes to gang up on the oil industry regarding the environment but we’re all okay with cities dumping thousands of tons of road salt on streets which ends up in our rivers and damages our bridges. We’re fine buying stuff shipped from China
1797 2018-12-17 20:55:31 Scooped up some $SWN here @ $3.61 for a swing... this chart is extremely beaten up on the daily. Looking for a small pop in oil and Nat Gas this week.
1798 2018-12-17 20:55:24 poached egg + salt & cracked pepper + good toast + olive oil + fresh basil + tomato is truly one of the best Foods 
1799 2018-12-17 20:55:21 Since it is burning oil, there wouldn’t be so much sparks (if any at all), if I‘m correct.
1800 2018-12-17 20:55:17 Weller - when pregnant with my eldest, Crowded House, and Midnight Oil.  I’m less cool then you 
1801 2018-12-17 20:55:14 It's something @politicalham has often pointed out, that the oil industry fails to even try to engage with people in BC, to improve their image.
1802 2018-12-17 20:55:12 Brace for another inflation slowdown driven by lower oil prices
1803 2018-12-17 20:55:08 FFS. The Canadian people have already been asked to absorb the cost of that frigging  $7 billion+ pipeline the Feds signed onto.  What more proof do they need that Ottawa is committed to spending our tax dollars on the oil patch?
1804 2018-12-17 20:54:53 @nypost
1805 2018-12-17 20:54:51 Is there a consistent correlation between the oil prices and the stock markets today?
1806 2018-12-17 20:54:46 جربتها بس انا مبحبش الطماطم
1807 2018-12-17 20:54:28 one time my future wife was watching TV & our flatmate walked in and pointed out a stain on her shirt, and she looked and saw that it was oil from a peanut M&M that had seeped through from inside her bra and she took the M&M out of her bra, locked eyes with the dude & ate it.
1808 2018-12-17 20:54:28 Arabs really think olive oil cures everything...papercut? Olive oil. Got shot in the chest? Olive oil. Cancer? Olive oil. It’s zeit zamzam now?
1809 2018-12-17 20:54:25 Tariff Saudi oil. Problem solved. Make them buy local or pay a higher price.
1810 2018-12-17 20:54:19 Which again is absolutely absurd. We have one of the largest reserves of oil in the world. We have some of the most stringent environmental standards in the world. We should be a global energy leader, not importing oil from other nations.
1811 2018-12-17 20:54:08 It's not an "oil tanker ban" the only ships that are impacted are those carrying Alberta oil all others continue to sail up and down our coast hundreds of times a year WITHOUT INCIDENT!
1812 2018-12-17 20:54:07 That's right! Crystals or oil but defenetly not!!
1813 2018-12-17 20:54:04 I think they wanna fuck oil
1814 2018-12-17 20:53:57 Разойдитесь, я жру соленую рыбу с маслом в перемешку
1815 2018-12-17 20:53:50 Wonder if the oil change guys will put gas in my car too
1816 2018-12-17 20:53:50 Oomfs looks like she needs an oil change.
1817 2018-12-17 20:53:48 They will eat yam and oil na
1818 2018-12-17 20:53:42 Put a tariff on their oil. Force them to buy local.
1819 2018-12-17 20:53:40 Similar to big oil companies with their ads about environmental protection. Cynical and fake.
1820 2018-12-17 20:53:31 Super- thanks! Everyone seems to always pitch coconut oil as the only alternative & if that happens I'll be dead lol So finding an alternative beyond that will be really helpful!
1821 2018-12-17 20:53:29 Nigeria owes IOCs $5.1bn in JV cash call debts – NNPC

@NNPCgroup told the Senate that the country’s debt to International Oil Companies stood at $5.1 billion. The NNPC said that the $5.1 billion debt was accumulated from the Joint Venture Cash Call (JVC) business arrangements.
1822 2018-12-17 20:53:28 Fucksake wouldn’t think vape oil would do that to you. Hahah off it then kids
1823 2018-12-17 20:53:13 Can you withdraw gold or oil from eToro?
1824 2018-12-17 20:53:11 Put a tariff on their oil. Problem solved. Buy local. Support local.
1825 2018-12-17 20:53:10 Finally getting my truck washed and the oil changed 
1826 2018-12-17 20:52:59 Thank you. I shall try this tomorrow. I used warm oil and a hot bath earlier today, which seemed to have uncramped my muscles a bit.
1827 2018-12-17 20:52:55 Exactly.......quit buying their oil and support Canadian Energy!!
1828 2018-12-17 20:52:51 Sense
1829 2018-12-17 20:52:50 Expensive oil = good for the EV market. Cheap oil = also good for the EV market.
1830 2018-12-17 20:52:40 and niggas be off that oil
1831 2018-12-17 20:52:34 P.S. 
Electric cars still need oil. Without oil the engine will freeze up, throw a rod, and break.  
This is true of all engines. Even sewing machines need oil.
Prosthesis are made from oil. 
Live saving pacemakers too.
1832 2018-12-17 20:52:28 @EmmaHardieUK is your brilliance face oil suitable to use during pregnancy? Thank you 
1833 2018-12-17 20:52:19 You talking about the guy with hackers in our nuclear plants, water distribution systems and oil & gas distribution systems? The guy who just parked 2 nuke-enabled planes in Venezuela and has spies sniffing out every mile of our fiber-optic network? Don't be so sure.
1834 2018-12-17 20:52:14 Better to end import of Saudi oil and revive Cdn energy industry? Bigger, longer lasting benefits. But that would mean Trudeau/Butts/Telford have to admit their poor policies to date.
1835 2018-12-17 20:52:11 This is why Hanukkah is the superior holiday, for it celebrates the most important miracle of all: Oil!
1836 2018-12-17 20:52:02 His authoritative power propels us to fight for HIS divine purpose with a fresh and a new oil for this generation and the generations to come... who will carry on His legacy?

1838 2018-12-17 20:52:00 Fam, the good lord just saved me from fire    in my kitchen .
Apparently I left groundnut oil on fire and decided to go check my Whatsapp for 2 minuites. Next I saw was smokes coming into m room and I ran inside the kitchen and everywhere was black fam !!!
1839 2018-12-17 20:51:59 Changed Ms.Shays oil the other week did lots of these this summer at my internship #RSP2019
1840 2018-12-17 20:51:44 The people of BC pay more for Alberta’s oil products than anyone else in North America. And Alberta keeps telling us that we need to play ball so that they can charge us even more for that fuel. Because me paying you more is good for me. Riiiight...
1841 2018-12-17 20:51:32 I use same depth on ES, dont need full book for it. I use full book for CL though, that is needed for orderflow on oil
1842 2018-12-17 20:51:28 Mario Dumont voyons, Id that all you have? We don't want dirty oil but will send you clean electricity Mon Ami
1843 2018-12-17 20:51:22 After approximately 17 years of trying I’ve finally just made a curry that tastes like a reasonable approximation of summat from a takeaway. The secret is shit loads of onions cooked for ages in shit loads of oil before you add the spices #madhurjaffrey

1845 2018-12-17 20:51:07 I had a buddy in high school who thought Dave Mustaine is a genius and got his autograph. He currently works on oil platforms
1846 2018-12-17 20:51:04 Perhaps leveraged loan funds based on banks funding failing oil business.
1847 2018-12-17 20:50:56 Sweet, and I know for my aching bones that this has worked in the past. I had only LP oil so I drank probably the whole bottle, ate some banana bread made out of oil from a MMAR grower, smoked some weed and then hit the liquor. Eventually I felt no pain. 
1848 2018-12-17 20:50:55 You first need to lure them with crude oil tho
1849 2018-12-17 20:50:52 Canadians do not own the access to its own oil deposits... been sold a long time ago
1850 2018-12-17 20:50:47 Yes. He is bullish oil. Should be $10 higher.

Hot water is provided to both homes by outdoor furnace, the smaller house has alternate propane hot water heater as well.Main home is 3BR/1.5BA, 2115SF, smaller home is 1BR/1BA, 1008SF.

Put Maggi, test it. 
Put salt, taste it
Put pepper, test it. 
Then put salt again and test it
1853 2018-12-17 20:50:22 - of course you would choose these emojis  you’re like the cool dad of the GC that everybody wants a piece of and never let me forget to change my oil but you also have a lot of great advice whenever I’m down  thanks for being such a great friend 
1854 2018-12-17 20:50:18 So what is the plan? Just drill and drill regardless of the oil price?
1855 2018-12-17 20:50:15 We have a mix - slow cooked gammon, Turkey crown, pigs in blankets, roast potatoes and parsnips in olive oil, Al dente Brussels sprouts in butter sprinkled with bacon and chestnuts, home made Yorkshire puddings, asparagus, alien trees broccoli (romesco) & lashings of gravy 
1856 2018-12-17 20:50:13 @Fern_Ferrari can you wear just a thong tonight...maybe bring the oil too? Xx

1860 2018-12-17 20:49:49 I guess that depends if they are asked to contribute in some way. Regardless the energy easy pipeline should be built. Let Quebec use all their inspectors and allow the oil companies to use all their newest pipe technologies to get it through.
1861 2018-12-17 20:49:44 Those who work in the oil and gas industry should think twice before visiting any of these cities. I won't spend another dime in Whistler or Victoria.
1862 2018-12-17 20:49:40 Oh hello oil - took you a bit longer than expected but finally showing some moves under $50-
1863 2018-12-17 20:49:36 broadly, the capitalist ruling class. billionaires, politicians from both parties, profiteers of industries such as oil, energy conglomerates; prison & military industrial complex. jeff bezos et al

i would agree with your last sentence there in a lot of ways actually
1864 2018-12-17 20:49:25 love to go to dig inn, spend $15 on decaying oil vegetables, eat 1 (one) vegetable, hide the plate out of sight, sit hungry for the rest of the day

1877 2018-12-17 20:47:58 Oh ffs... It’s high time we shut them off. Do a Green New Deal, end our addiction to mid-east oil, and mid-east drama, at the same time.
1878 2018-12-17 20:47:57 Just look at the gold or oil bear markets of the past decade to see what is possible.
1879 2018-12-17 20:47:54 Cornish man faces 15 years in Indonesian jail - found with cannabis oil he says he needed for arthritis. Some on-call fire engines sent out with 3, not 5 crew. Tom Butler, Newquay may have surfed into record books by taking on biggest wave of all time! Join me 2230 @BBCSpotlight
1880 2018-12-17 20:47:53 i know how to make canna butter already! but when you use butter it lessens the THC content, coconut oil retains about 97% of the natural thc!
1881 2018-12-17 20:47:44 I’ve never done it with chilli oil!
1882 2018-12-17 20:47:34 So much for incentives to help save the environment and unshackle us from oil in the Middle East.
1883 2018-12-17 20:47:21 stuck on the oil rig 
1884 2018-12-17 20:47:20 Has anyone tried skwerting her with oil? i saw it work in a movie once.
1885 2018-12-17 20:47:20 We have a huge problem coming at us.   A lot of people are about to find out the koolaid they've been hooked on is actually snake oil
1886 2018-12-17 20:47:15 Girls be darker than Akon talkin bout they mixed... With what? Oil and dirt?
1887 2018-12-17 20:47:11 So now $GS is buying oil while telling clients to sell?
1888 2018-12-17 20:47:05 Without question Irving buys from the Saudis. I'm just not sure if Irving would be against building pipelines to cheaper Albera Oil.
1889 2018-12-17 20:47:00 Also represents cheaper oil than Canadian sources, so Irving won’t be giving that up even if Energy East was constructed. 

10% of the industry is a massive energy deficit that can’t be bridged with current renewables. Particularly at such a low price.

Maybe next will be best engine oil for Benz products
1893 2018-12-17 20:46:41 They pay to elevate ppl who already think the way they want. The whole Beto thing w/ Sirota is a prime example of the misunderstanding. Ppl made a big deal of the fact that Beto brought in more oil $$ than anyone else, but ignored that it was barely .5% of his total haul. 2/
1894 2018-12-17 20:46:36 He is making ppl do what they don't want to do.

C'mon, man
1897 2018-12-17 20:46:33 They’re literally trying to create Republicans by changing the way we teach children. Jesus rode Dino’s and guns and never apologize. Oil is life so bathe in it
1898 2018-12-17 20:46:33 So if we want to develop cleaner energy, it will take time and money. Right? So how do we get the money to pay for the development of cleaner energy?  What incentive do we use to convince oil companies to spend R&D money on clean energy?
1899 2018-12-17 20:46:28 How can you buy commodities when inflation is slowing and oil (dropping) drives inflation?
1900 2018-12-17 20:46:23 It will never happen Suzy. Not while the Zionist Khazars are in control of Israel. Zionist Israel wants the huge oil and gas field under Palestine and would never allow the Palestinians access to the wealth that would enable them to purchase modern weapons.
1901 2018-12-17 20:46:18 USD weakness has been the theme for the last 24 hours with stocks slipping and Oil back below $50 adding to negative sentiment as EUR has now retraced back to the 200 HMA at 1.1357. The NZD & AUD have had subdued sessions with CAD weakening on the Oil price.
1902 2018-12-17 20:46:10 "I WOULD RATHER TALK ABOUT THE OIL SPILLS THAN WHATEVER YOU'RE GOING ON ABOUT CORY" is probably still one of my favs!
1903 2018-12-17 20:45:57 There's a difference between diluted bitumen and light crude oil. How much do you think we import and from whom?

1910 2018-12-17 20:45:26 It was more that our Red state, Mormon Run, Trump-pocketed government slashed two national monuments and parks, while cutting funding for said parks, to get oil.  Marijuana had almost nothing to do with it, and bad governance in SLC had everything.

Only solution involves future technology for LOW capitol, LOW cost replacement to oil/coal.
1926 2018-12-17 20:44:10  me too.

Its nice. because you set the temp. walk awat. dont have to constantly monitor so your not getting it too hot.

I usually make coconut oil myself. Easy replacement for any butter or oil in any recipe 
1927 2018-12-17 20:44:09 Shale oil,pumping oil by burning OPM, ruined oil industry itself.Selling USA precious resource below extraction cost,peddled by wall st propaganda as shale revolution, misled by shale oil producers CEOS ABOUT Historical LOW break even price. Distortion of opinions = WS free fall.
1928 2018-12-17 20:43:57 wow closing in on a 600 pt drop with oil now at 49.25
1929 2018-12-17 20:43:53 $NBEV sure guys, like people are really going to pay up for snake oil when the economy is tanking.
1930 2018-12-17 20:43:52 Can’t be me, I’m obsessed with beans. Like I eat it almost everyday, Lol from ewa agoin to normal cooked beans with enough pepper and palm oil inside.
1931 2018-12-17 20:43:44 I'm not advocating anything like that, I do know a mates cousin who has beaten cancer thanks to THC oil, it's not a myth. Cost him £1500 for oil. How much would it have cost the NHS to treat him with chemo? Stick a load of zeros on. Spain has high quality oil all tested.
1932 2018-12-17 20:43:33 It’s an absolute treat to make and to eat. Browning the rice in hot oil and sizzling in the spicy spinach broth. Sensational!
1933 2018-12-17 20:43:33 This means nothing without stopping the oil coming in. Why not take their money give it to Canadians build a pipeline to the east and hit them where it hurts in there pocket book. Make us energy Independant with our clean oil our human rights advocacy and our own workers.
1934 2018-12-17 20:43:24 LMFAO not the holy oil 
1935 2018-12-17 20:42:59 Every time the Dems get a little power back, this is the kind of shit they do. Let’s focus on the things that got you elected. Healthcare, education, and the environment. Maybe do something about oil and coal lobbyists running the EPA and the DOI? Get net neutrality back?
1936 2018-12-17 20:42:58 finally changed my car's oil now I'm gonna shotgun 4 beers
1937 2018-12-17 20:42:26 How closely do these tickets track with oil prices. Time frames for the tickets to correlate with oil? I’ve been trying to learn the how to trade equities that relate to commodities.
1938 2018-12-17 20:42:21 He may not have created the oil and gas industry we seen today.......but with all billions in subsidies he gave all of his Wind Farm democratic donor buddies......he did create a lot of hot air.
1939 2018-12-17 20:42:06 I don’t really use a recipe. My mom taught me how to make it. The key ingredients are chicken, onions, tomatoes, garlic and ginger paste, oil and salt and then the secret family powders and seasonings!
1940 2018-12-17 20:42:02 ‘You lot’ you mean ALL the female population? There’s nowt like a sweeping statement to undermine ones argument. I have no idea what you’re referencing and I’m not getting into a she said, he said, they said, debate. As a rough guess I’d probably say she was pissed off.
1941 2018-12-17 20:41:56 Can't you see that a president who authorised the use of napalm on Vietnamese children, a terror campaign against Cuba and appointed a family friend to the CIA was just too radical to be left alive by an alliance of the CIA, teamsters, Texas oil men and pro-Castro communists?
1942 2018-12-17 20:41:49 ROSE HIP OIL/SERUM
- It’s best to use 100% rose hip oil. It can be found in tj max inexpensively if your on a budget. Apply the oil/serum twice a day to your entire face or just the scars. It also works even better paired with a derma roller.
1943 2018-12-17 20:41:47 Smuggling of liquefied gas (Belarusian oil company)  from Belarus to a number of EU countries is increasing .

1946 2018-12-17 20:41:32 Last night at new Italian resto Prairie, had what was basically creamy dip made of whipped burrata, spring onions & lemon oil. I want to marry that dip. Shallots and/or chives would go well in it.
1947 2018-12-17 20:41:25 The clowns abusing joe Worral are the same ones who cream there pants when oil mcburnie tweets
1948 2018-12-17 20:41:24 Seriously, I live with chronic pain, 2 herniated discs, bone on bone in both knees, frozen shoulder, and docs are prescribing Motrin & Tylenol 3 when they’re feeling bold. One dude tried to give me Lyrica for a condition I don’t have.  I now rely on CBD oil, THC & phys therapy.
1949 2018-12-17 20:41:14 but honestly vitamin e & c oil is super good for ur face

1952 2018-12-17 20:40:10 They should of made the rule to be this... to run for President, as a Democrat, you have to be a registered Democrat the past 8 years.... that will make sure snake oil doesnt penetrate the party again

1957 2018-12-17 20:40:02 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it
1958 2018-12-17 20:39:49 Quebecers would rather buy Middle East oil than Canadian oil. Time to shut down transfer payments. Oh right Boy Blunder can only get elected with votes from these hypocrites
1959 2018-12-17 20:39:40 I wish I could. A good portion of it is paper and im afraid it would brown/burn. That is def the right answer I think if it were totally oil paint. Thanks!
1960 2018-12-17 20:39:36 FACTS COUNT: even with the drop in oil prices, AB has the strongest economy in Canada, by far. Highest GDP per capita & highest percentage of people employed. We should ask: why are the UCP (with help from Rebel Media) trying to mischaracterize the situation ? THEY ARE LYING !!
1961 2018-12-17 20:39:35 Isn’t it oil money that made city what it is today. Massa sorrhor
1962 2018-12-17 20:39:30 Shey na oil
1963 2018-12-17 20:39:27 But oil prices are low everywhere, even for Brent Crude oil sold in Texas.
1964 2018-12-17 20:39:24 Bollinger centerline, failed to cross on Friday so flushing hard today BC of Friday's bullish engulfin (as I stated on Friday it would do).  I thought $50 would hold for at least a bounce, but markets tanking pushed oil below $50 support on demand fears)
1965 2018-12-17 20:39:20 Shey na oil
1966 2018-12-17 20:39:15 No, US dollar is not tied to oil, oil prices have been holding steady if not declining in my area, and Saudi Arabia doesn’t have much else under it’s belt. You are not a threat.
1967 2018-12-17 20:39:08 Do you cook your eggs in oil?
1968 2018-12-17 20:39:05 PROPERTY is the new Oil and Gold. Worker's Homes are now stock market commodities and investment opportunities for the 10% at the top and parasitic landlords down the scale. They control the Banks/Politicians/Housing legislation. But they only control the Ballot Box if allowed to
1969 2018-12-17 20:39:02 Or you can try harder next semester instead of not doing your work? And then continue drawing in your down time.. yeah school is hard. And its harder when you dont do certain things. But keep up the hard you. You can do it

1971 2018-12-17 20:38:45 No matter how much I scrub and clean the shower, the floor is constantly slick as fucking oil and I'm just waiting on the day I have to call justin to take me to the ER because I've busted my head or broke my back. I literally get into the shower skating. Like yeah, so safe. 
1972 2018-12-17 20:38:30 You must hate him now! Unlikely to strike oil I imagine
1973 2018-12-17 20:38:25 This is only good if we can get off Middle Eastern oil.

This is terrible for the climate.
1974 2018-12-17 20:38:24 Mario ... because of Obama we now produce more oil than the Saudi Kingdom
1975 2018-12-17 20:38:22 NO OIL! NO GREASE!! Y'all can keep that revival cast album. I'll have no parts.
1976 2018-12-17 20:38:20 Sorry, if "peak oil" is 'a thing' in the oil industry. I was referring to the massive spike in revenues indicated in the graph.
1977 2018-12-17 20:38:17 Smuggling of liquefied gas (Belarusian oil company)  from Belarus to a number of EU countries is increasing .

1979 2018-12-17 20:37:57 Its not like they're calling all the actors reactionary and imperialist, but the US is somehow the only imperialist power in Syria.... despite there also being Russian military presence because of a Russian oil pipeline in the area..
1980 2018-12-17 20:37:49 Definitely need a oil change ASAP
1981 2018-12-17 20:37:44 Like the 100,000 people in the oil and energy sector that had well paying jobs and now will be on welfare next year thanks to you and the rest of the Liberals? Those kind of people?
1982 2018-12-17 20:37:41 It’s not the fish oil you need, it’s the vitamin Ch.
1983 2018-12-17 20:37:39 Complete this formula. K=M/0.87
1984 2018-12-17 20:37:32 That bad?? Lots of water and no dairy, also stick your head over a bowl of steaming hot water with a few drops of albas oil, drape a towel over your head and breathe in the vapours
1985 2018-12-17 20:37:07 i told myself i was gonna wake up early and get my oil changed, work out, and clean my room but instead i woke up at like 1pm and im eating tamales and watching netflix in my pjs
1986 2018-12-17 20:37:00 Yeah, sooo afraid. So afraid he sold defensive arms to Ukraine, blew up 200 of their mercenaries in Syria, ended deal with their Iranian client state, approved MDS in Poland, lessened our dependence on their oil, and reamed Germany for enriching them via Nordsteam deal.
1987 2018-12-17 20:36:57 Will this protect the beautiful land from oil drilling, fracking etc? If not, then just another committee going nowhere
1988 2018-12-17 20:36:30 Oil bet we're nearing the end
1989 2018-12-17 20:36:28 a lady at the salvation army just bought an original oil painting of jerry lewis as a clown should I offer her two hundred dollars for it
1990 2018-12-17 20:36:24 I put MCT oil in my coffee for the first time and wow bro how fucking horrible
1991 2018-12-17 20:36:16 Right! But because you know US dollar is tied to oil as A value , and Saudi is the Major player in Oil markets, it is fact that were the only country who can change that not any other country . Also, why America keep insisting to trade oil with chinese currency?  They know it lol
1992 2018-12-17 20:36:11 There would be no liability for stopping imports of their oil.  They may respond by canceling the arms deal and then have to pay us.  Win?
1993 2018-12-17 20:36:06 You obviously do not understand oil markets. #sad
1994 2018-12-17 20:36:06 2532 the low of the year for s&p's cash, ten handles from here and the negative loop spiral also exists with oil, equities lower, oil lower.  oil lower, equities lower.  Each assuming the other "guy" knows something...
1995 2018-12-17 20:35:54 lols, Puntland was virgin area, v risky. But this is proven area, just 3 miles from 1.2 billion oil field (horseshoe)
1996 2018-12-17 20:35:51 makes sense. oil and water dont mix
1997 2018-12-17 20:35:45 @jiffylube : wow is car is dying we can fix it tho if you pay us with your soul qnd half ur college tuition

1999 2018-12-17 20:35:32 He deleted his dumb reply taking about Obama start exporting oil first loool
2000 2018-12-17 20:35:23 Are u buying oil now?
2001 2018-12-17 20:35:18 Olive &amp; almond oil are rich in essential fatty acids which help strengthen dry &amp; cracked nails
2002 2018-12-17 20:35:15 Hey, at least oil companies keep investors happy for another quarterly report!
2003 2018-12-17 20:35:13 I'm thinking this person has only had unflavored couscous. No herbs. No spices. Nothing. Maybe some salt and oil, poor things.
2004 2018-12-17 20:35:10 Yeah my first car was a Honda Accord '02. Dropped around that price for it. Had 100k miles but it was solid; lasted me 5 years. Minimum maintenance: standard oil changes. But it all depends on what you're looking for: Make, model, miles.

It’s the perfect fit present! 
Come in and have a scent test
2007 2018-12-17 20:34:56 Nobody stays down voluntarily. No area of the country asks for handouts. It’s just that the entire country wasn’t lucky enough to have oil under it that basically produces free money.
2008 2018-12-17 20:34:51 Tar sands oil is for export. Few refineries can handle it. Where are we getting the replacement oil from? More dependency on the US? How do you propose we convince anyone to pay more for domestic anyway?
2009 2018-12-17 20:34:50 You’re giving the premier credit for powers he doesn’t have. Quebec doesn’t have the refinery capacity to upgrade AB oil.
2010 2018-12-17 20:34:37 what company is it from?? i'm always dying for lipsticks that don't have Chemical Cupcake ™ as their scent/flavor, i still cherish the expired julep mini lipsticks that were scented with orange oil [!!!]
2011 2018-12-17 20:34:29 That's right , because nobody in Scotland pays tax, oil, fishing farming etc 
2012 2018-12-17 20:34:24 I’m glad I’ve waited 2+ hours to get my oil changed 
2013 2018-12-17 20:34:20 #OIL ..... REMEMBER what I said last week.... when ANYTHING gets that trounced like this did, be PATIENT!.... when #Commodities are carving out bottoms they usually test it MULTIPLE times.... like you have seen in #metals over the last 4 months and the $DXY at 88
2014 2018-12-17 20:34:10 Pour olive oil down my throat
2015 2018-12-17 20:34:02 I get that today / I think point is so many other factors and one guy on a channel no one watches merely another noise - this carries on from Friday’s funk - then the constant Fed headlines,  oil down etc etc
2016 2018-12-17 20:33:55 Wait. Does this picture have anything to do with Oil price?

2019 2018-12-17 20:33:52 Alberta is in a very unique position when it comes to our oil and gas industry. Imagine if you will gas below .70 cents a litre in Alberta, while the rest of Canada pays upwards of $1.50 per litre. How fast would a pipeline be approved then?
2020 2018-12-17 20:33:46 What a sexy  body could rub hot oil on it for hrs
2021 2018-12-17 20:33:43 a toy dinosaur, Mr. Rogers post-it notes, an essential oil roll-on and a US dollar themed Matryoshka doll 
2022 2018-12-17 20:33:42 The pipeline the US wanted would have run through areas in the south the us-backed opposition and isis controlled but Syria took back a lot of that so now the us is just sitting on the oil

2025 2018-12-17 20:33:31 Idea: 3rd wave CBD oil 

Optional: Experience it with a VR headset!
2026 2018-12-17 20:33:16 I'm sure Vivian has some good points.  But my experience in the oil patch was that if it was expedient and no one was watching closely regulations were ignored.  I've watched Frac effluent pour out onto the prairie to save 600 bucks and we all kept quiet to keep our jobs.

2032 2018-12-17 20:32:55 I don’t mind that as much as to when they start sweating and the black hairspray runs down on their head as if there was a oil spill. Set that ish
2033 2018-12-17 20:32:45 building pipelines and flogging 3 times the amount of oil will cure everything
2034 2018-12-17 20:32:44 Oil will continue to consumed with no slow down.
India's energy demand is forecast to double in the next two decades. Yet in that period China will remain the number one consumer of oil, and the chief emitter of CO2. New Scientist 17th November 2018.
2035 2018-12-17 20:32:43 Just massaged my ear lobes with jojoba oil for the first time.... man that feels weird af
2036 2018-12-17 20:32:40 That's how we got DDT wiping out the bald eagles. That's how we got biggest oil spill in the Gulf Coast costing billions of dollars. That's what we have now with polluted drinking water. Environmental Pollution Agency.
2037 2018-12-17 20:32:36 You have no clue what you are talking about. Every industry has waste. Without oil you would have been eaten by a bear long time ago. Maybe not so bad after all
2038 2018-12-17 20:32:34 sorry what oil cut deal was that again?? oil under 50$!! #oott
2039 2018-12-17 20:32:28 Jojoba oil!
2040 2018-12-17 20:32:28 Energy self-sufficiency isn't the point.  Being free to trade oil to highest bidder, no matter who they are, is the point.  And, It is pure stupidity that CDA imports oil at full price while we sell oil at discount elsewhere, all because JT and gang don't want pipes in CDA.
2041 2018-12-17 20:32:25 Mine is engine oil. My dad was an engineer and every time I take the car to a garage that smell of oil and hot metal brings him back in an instant.
2042 2018-12-17 20:32:21 Have fun with that. I’m sure China is real keen to stay dependent on your oil while it’s investing heavily in renewable fuels. You are on the clock, you know it, but you can’t curb your bloodlust.
2043 2018-12-17 20:32:15 Exactly... you don’t get paid for good deeds. The market doesn’t care about that.

Market also doesn’t care how much oil you dump in the ocean or how much CO2 you dump into the atmosphere...

The free market can’t solve the 21st centuries biggest problems.
2044 2018-12-17 20:32:13 Dahil to sa fish oil. Hudas!
2045 2018-12-17 20:32:09 Alberta has made political decisions over the years to have much lower taxes, pay off municipal debts and not have sales tax, while at the same time buttering up the oil companies. That's why Norway has a $ Trillion oil fund and Alberta doesn't. 40 years of PC mismanagement.
2046 2018-12-17 20:32:03 the place I’m at now does better when oil & gas prices are up
2047 2018-12-17 20:32:02 He had the body oil ready though.
2048 2018-12-17 20:31:59 as for Capt Coconut Oil his brilliant shifts resulted in the Phillies being the worst defensive team statistically in 15 years. Mismanaged the pitching staff all year, no concept of structuring a lineup. Team lacked basic fundamentals. He was lucky he had a good starting rotation
2049 2018-12-17 20:31:57 Yes, a slowing economy does impact oil prices.

And at the same time, Trump increasing oil production and pressing OPEC is not what Putin wants.

As to ego...Obama had such a Titanic ego he nearly bankrupted the DNC doing focus groups even though he couldn't run again.
2050 2018-12-17 20:31:56 Crude oil in 2008 was $90 a barrel and $1.67 at the pump. Today crude oil is $51 a barrel and I am still paying $3.19 at the pump. There seems to be a hefty markup that is unacceptably high.

2052 2018-12-17 20:31:46 Except... a pipeline is the safest method to transport oil. Sunday are you really espousing? It's probably something much more radical... like killing our industry and economy for an ideologically driven agenda.

2059 2018-12-17 20:31:04 So many unintended consequences Trump and his smashing down oil to 60 one thing now under 50 - what did he think was going to happen - yes the trade wars, Brexit, macron - bitcoin just highlighted the no risk delusion no?
2060 2018-12-17 20:31:04 Oh yes, those are other product types. The $20 was just for crude oil (code '2709'). These are other products -- notice the first four digits of the codes aren't 2709. The 2710, for example, are like refined/processed products.

@Asad_Umar please buy thr futures now so that we can see lower petrol prices in the new year
2062 2018-12-17 20:30:55 I replaced both car dome lights, put in a new air filter, topped off the oil, and added windshield fluid....while wearing a dress.

2066 2018-12-17 20:30:47 Fine. You're older. Things'll get dicey for us but we should make it. I thought you care about your son and maybe young children? Was it worth sacrificing their future so we could burn coal, oil and gas? One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh; Ecclesiastes 1-4
2067 2018-12-17 20:30:46 When people like the premier of Quebec veto Energy East, they are CHOOSING foreign oil over AB oil. Plain and simple.
2068 2018-12-17 20:30:40 Matthew, take #CBD oil, it cures cancer. That is a scientific fact. 

I don't know @ Baking Soda, but CBD works, so does Vitamin C.

2072 2018-12-17 20:30:24 I don't get the sense that your government cares one whit about Alberta's oil and gas employees. I believe your government would rather see them unemployed than build our fossil fuel sector. Most Ontario citizens seem to agree.
2073 2018-12-17 20:30:23 Sara Eisen so gleeful today about the market drop.  @cnbc
2074 2018-12-17 20:30:17 Oil prices are low because Alberta has one customer - the US, due solely to lack of sufficient pipeline capacity. Oil companies have, and are, investing heavily in alternatives, but, best indicators are that nothing will be available in sufficient market quantities until 2030-40.
2075 2018-12-17 20:30:14 Between a high price of oil and very low price, which one favours Nigeria most?

2082 2018-12-17 20:29:19 Anyone who doesn’t benefit from the systemic volitility is. Would you not say the oil and gas workers that lost everything because of the oil price collapse are victims?
2083 2018-12-17 20:29:09 Lower gas prices are not actually a positive thing. Many oil field workers are laid off because of this.

2088 2018-12-17 20:28:44 The United States now occupies 1/3rd of Syria. 

Funny how that happens. #Syria #Oil
2089 2018-12-17 20:28:40 Ok Alberta. These oil and gas rallies are getting ridiculous. We hear you, loud and fucking clear. But we were done listening a long time ago.
2090 2018-12-17 20:28:29 Sir, HB to you and many more healthy years ahead. But for your legacy to secure you have to work harder on fixing the power problems. Believe me the economy reliance on oil will diminish greatly.
2091 2018-12-17 20:28:14 Three yrs ago you couldn’t care less about oil workers. Your energy minister told them to go to BC to find work.
2092 2018-12-17 20:28:11 Omg my drawing hand is rustyyyyyy *pulls out the last of the radler* Better oil it up!
2093 2018-12-17 20:28:08 Now look up how much Saudi oil went to Quebec from Alberta. Small secret, they own a large portion of Alberta oil. Have for decades
2094 2018-12-17 20:27:51 I explained that. Beto was No. 1 on every other donor list. Many Texas employees of oil and gas companies donated and voted for him. They are individuals who cannot donate over $2700. My husband donated $500 cause we are tired of the GOP destroying human rights.
2095 2018-12-17 20:27:29 When u were in school, you never tought u will end up selling coconut oil.. 
Life's crazy..
2096 2018-12-17 20:27:23 Wind turbines hold ~10-50 gallons of refined oil. When 1 fell over it only leaked 45 gallons of oil. The Keystone Pipeline leaked nearly 10,000 gallons of crude oil last year in just 1 of a dozen leaks in its first year of operation.

2106 2018-12-17 20:26:12 the Steele Dossier is 99 % correct and Trump was offered 19% of the commissions from the brokerage of Russian oil giant Rosneft in exchange for him lifting sanctions, and Trump agreed, that would amount to TREASON.

That's not American First!
That's Trump & Russia First!
2107 2018-12-17 20:26:12 What if orm sabotaged the oil rig?
2108 2018-12-17 20:26:05 Reread the previous tweet. Canada doesn’t buy oil, companies like Irving buy oil
2109 2018-12-17 20:26:04 Are your Christmas puddings made with sustainable palm oil?
2110 2018-12-17 20:25:51 I cooked my lazy man rice again.

Pour rice on fire.. Add seasoning cubes... Let it cook.  Sieve it.. Pour oil on fire, fry onions and grounded pepper, add the cooked rice,  stir and add fish. 

God bless me
2111 2018-12-17 20:25:47 When is Canada going to stop buying their blood oil?
2112 2018-12-17 20:25:45 This is just crude. What about refined products? It's a silly discussion regardless. Personally don't care where Qc gets its oil. Just want to see more of ours sold at better price. Let's get TMX built and help make the econ case for KXL in the US (hint - our oil is cheaper).
2113 2018-12-17 20:25:41 Yep for sure. Although all that and an oil change is $630 so merry Christmas to me.
2114 2018-12-17 20:25:39 Mix some leave in conditioner with water, spray on your scalp then apply oil. I make my oil.

2118 2018-12-17 20:25:18 All other things aside, opening up all lands in the federal offshore to oil and gas leasing at once is not an efficient business model.

Cleanse your face and apply coconut oil or olive oil or pears baby before u sleep...
2123 2018-12-17 20:25:00 It takes some time to figure out its quirks. And you definitely need more oil than you think you do if you want crispiness.
2124 2018-12-17 20:24:51 Y’all worried about “big pharma” and being all money hungry for vaccines but you freely help to pad those pockets of “big essential oil” by buying up all their oils.  #weird
2125 2018-12-17 20:24:50 right. Feeling like you finna wake up with all these breakouts from the sweat steam and oil.  My thighs used to break out from portioning fries cause the oil would drench my apron.

2129 2018-12-17 20:24:33 This is you’re logic for letting Alberta die while central and eastern Canada continue to import oil from the US and Saudi Arabia? Living beyond ones means is a problem best exemplified by the ridiculous transfer payments QC relies on year after year. Fuckin’ hypocrite.

2131 2018-12-17 20:24:26 I work in the oil industry and think the Liberals have handled the pipeline file in a less than optimum way. But I won’t listen to bullshit from Harperites like you. Grow up and tell the truth or keep your mouth shut. #cdnpoli
2132 2018-12-17 20:24:14 we will still selling the oil to china and other country who need it we will buy the military equipment from Russia and china and you will be crying over your stupid senate  who probably already stole all of your money
2133 2018-12-17 20:24:13 They are excellent. Cheap chocolate but in the bestest way. Like how you remember advent calendar chocolate/pick and mix chocolate as a kid, before it became full of palm oil and inedible.

2136 2018-12-17 20:23:57 Now let's do Obama. He literally bowed to the Saudi King and let them rape our citizens by not drilling for oil. Kim Jong Un menaced the world w nukes while Obama cowed down. And he told Putin's man on mic to "wait until after his election" and then sold Russia our uranium
2137 2018-12-17 20:23:55 Biggest drill of 2019 & if hit oil will be the largest ever onshore discovery in AIM for the last many many years, infact will be the largest discovery since GKP
2138 2018-12-17 20:23:48 Sounds like an easy way to keep oil as a "national security" issue. It is not, it's a commodity we can work around if needed, despite those donors that have written this bill and paid you to endorse it.  Humans can live on other sources of energy, and some day we will.

2142 2018-12-17 20:23:24 Had to look up #DustyV  I got statins on my script. I would prefer an oz of green and both cbd and thc oil on it. That would sort me out. Know a lot of people on oil and doing very well. Dumping drs drugs and telling them why. A lot of drs aren't surprised, mine went.
2143 2018-12-17 20:22:58 Mr Wall. The govt doesnt  buy  oil. Private companies do. You would be aware of that as you once had an important job that dealt with these sorts of things. Are you suggesting that the free market and corporate autonomy that conservative  worship  isn't actually a good thing?
2144 2018-12-17 20:22:55 So grateful to everyone that organized and participated in the #ShirtsOffOurBacks fundraiser. Thank you for bringing joy to thousands of #yeg families this Christmas.

2151 2018-12-17 20:22:28 BUT adding professional help as an afterthought, be it therapy or psychiatry or whatever, is a problem. Enough people are stuggling with the stigma of seekig help and are dealing with shit alone to begin with, no need to add oil to the flame. (2/?)
2152 2018-12-17 20:22:27 You understand that the oil industry is fine and making record profits, and that unemployment is a problem caused by corporate greed and not government taxes?

2156 2018-12-17 20:22:13 No reason ? trade war, record margin debt, smashed oil price, crypto collapse, political mess, housing down turn - it’s not all about the Fed is it?
2157 2018-12-17 20:22:11 Obama has taken credit for anything that is now good in our country, including oil independence, unemployment, jobs, the economy
2158 2018-12-17 20:22:01 You don’t want our oil? Ok then we will keep our transfer payments. You aren’t a Conservative or a Canadian. You are a Quebecer. You and Trudeau are one and the same.

2165 2018-12-17 20:21:24 OPEC literally begs for the US to buy more oil from them to keep prices at a national level and stable. If you would like to understand why those conflicts happened I would love to explain them.
2166 2018-12-17 20:21:23 Ni con oil a 20$ nos salvan de la crisis que viene. Tu vives en un pais que eso lo conoce bien. De ti y tus opiniones intento aprender.

Bushes tied US tail to Aramco due profit motive for their friends and family. Time to sever this and reformulate Mideast policies. Greater concern-# nukes Saudis possess.

2177 2018-12-17 20:19:53 You have a misconception on way the US was in conflict with Iran,Afghanistan,Saudi Arabia and others. It was never about oil, and to explain all this is way to long in 140 letters. OPEC controls the production and sell of oil in Middle East. Only 20% of our oil comes from there.

2183 2018-12-17 20:19:19 You understand that Alberta drives Canada and Oil is still the major resource relied on most in this country
2184 2018-12-17 20:19:18 @ProfOsinbajo we have proven reserves in the ND yet we choose  to explore for oil in the North. Resources we need to develop current offshore acreages.
2185 2018-12-17 20:19:13 Well, they had 70 people die during an extreme heat wave this summer (#climatechange), so you can understand why they might want to move away from oil and gas altogether.
2186 2018-12-17 20:19:08 44 years of not diversifying the economy. 
It was the fed that originally got the TMX to the ocean.  
When Harper was elected he pulled us out of Kyoto and declared war on environmentalists. 

He got his war

(Much less foreign money in environmental groups than in the oil patch)
2187 2018-12-17 20:19:00 Obnoxious oil
2188 2018-12-17 20:18:57 Not much anyone can do when oil prices are so low. Time for Alberta to talk diversification using money it raises in the next price cycle.
2189 2018-12-17 20:18:55 みんながそうやって炒められて揚げられて…ねぇ、誰のおかげ?誰のおかげかな?

＼It's OIL!!!／
2190 2018-12-17 20:18:48 That's when the world is uncertain that oil price and interest rates fall the most and trigger the heaviest positive growth surprise.
2191 2018-12-17 20:18:43 Aaah mfana still need some oil to smoothen the way 
2192 2018-12-17 20:18:37 How about the government try and dig up the clean energy technologies that have been bought up by “big oil” and buried. They always have to punish the little guy!!
2193 2018-12-17 20:18:34 oil got real cheap in 2009 down to around $1.60 a gallon since so many people had no money and auto industry was on tilt
2194 2018-12-17 20:18:31 Need another interview with iran oil minister
2195 2018-12-17 20:18:29 He actually did OK in November. Oil was down a lot more than 5pct so he must have liquidated early.
2196 2018-12-17 20:18:27 Parboil it, spritz it with a little oil, then sprinkle with sea salt and smoked paprika and then roast in the oven 
2197 2018-12-17 20:18:25 .End all arms sales to #SaudiArabia, and stop buying its bloody oil!
2198 2018-12-17 20:18:24 Are we supposed to feel better about Russian or South American oil?
2199 2018-12-17 20:18:23 What is everyone's supplement stack?
I'm taking ZMA glycine ashwaghanda theanine fish oil creatine iodine & multi.
2200 2018-12-17 20:18:16 Who will protect sea lanes to Middle East? Especially if war breaks out between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Where will u get ur oil? Pick a side? Willing to go to war for It? Ready to defend dwindling access against your Asian nations desiring the same limited access?
2201 2018-12-17 20:18:06 oh right the oil. ha ha
2202 2018-12-17 20:18:06 Thank you Lord for Jamaican Black castor oil  it’s saving my edges from my destructive behaviors
2203 2018-12-17 20:17:55 They need some training from Trump's Kellyanne Conway... she's far better at smokescreens and slippery oil sprays than this pillock.
2204 2018-12-17 20:17:50 I have been wondering the same thing, as well as how his big oil supporters like Harold Hamm feel about his current stance on oil.
2205 2018-12-17 20:17:47 went to get an oil change & they fixed my bumper for free  wow what a day
2206 2018-12-17 20:17:46 oil oops I mean suffering
2207 2018-12-17 20:17:45 its like regular delicious fries but they have been (obviously) mistakenly dusted with dirty gym sock flavored salt. or even worse tossed in that dolce & gabbana truffle perfume disguised as oil.
2208 2018-12-17 20:17:30 Always wear gloves when handling any chemicals as cleaners are designed to remove oil and grease as well as the natural oils in your skin.
2209 2018-12-17 20:17:24 A lot of trouble in the Middle East is caused by western powers trying to control governments so that they can extract oil and protect Israel, since Israel is a military asset in an oil rich region.
2210 2018-12-17 20:17:23 Cause i love olive oil
2211 2018-12-17 20:17:22 Yemen’s geographical location, the third best in the world, its rich resources, oil, gas, rock, agricultural and fishing abundance, and diversity of landscape should make it one of the world’s wealthiest countries.
2212 2018-12-17 20:17:20 We need the media to run more stories about climate change and how it is affecting all of us on this planet.  If we don’t change our behavior with coal and oil. Thank you Ali for the story today keep it up.
2213 2018-12-17 20:17:16 Kind of a fan of the bear, house, oil can, and horse. Cigar guy 90% chance abuser.
2214 2018-12-17 20:17:09 They’ll just have to receive their payments in Western oil in lieu of cash. FOB Alberta unless they can figure out some way to move it east
2215 2018-12-17 20:16:55 Oh my god the person Trump put in for Dept of Interior was an oil and gas lobbyist.  There should be a law that prohibits this in any administation
2216 2018-12-17 20:16:47 The system (the EU) is broken beyond fixing. I hope Brexit causes it to collapse and a new formation of nations in solidarity will emerge. One dedicated to a green economy and not tied to oil states and lobbying. Oh to dream lol
2217 2018-12-17 20:16:42 #GKP it's just tracking all other major oil plays. Doesn't seem to be much out of the ordinary. Beauty with this is the circa £200m back stop
2218 2018-12-17 20:16:32 Check your Engine oil this afternoon.
2219 2018-12-17 20:16:25 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
2220 2018-12-17 20:16:21 First off Somalia doesn’t produce oil. Secondly the military operation you are referring too about 9/11 had nothing to do with OPEC which produces and controls the oil in Middle East. Go take a college level history coarse to understand our involvement in the world.
2221 2018-12-17 20:16:21 My boss called me into his office and had a picture of pancakes with syrup on them on his computer and was like “What do you think of these” and I’m like “That’s some good looking motor oil right there” and then he gave me that “wtf” kinda look
2222 2018-12-17 20:16:18 I have an oil lamp!! After I moved my trailer in 2014, I spent 5 days in it w/out power (cold month). It was so...Amish. 
Glad you guys survived fairly well during that scary Hurricane.
2223 2018-12-17 20:16:18 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
2224 2018-12-17 20:16:10 i use coconut oil religiously
2225 2018-12-17 20:16:07 Nymex Settles 12/17/18 - CL Jan19: 49.88 (-1.32) (-2.2% vs Last Week) #nymex #wti #oil
2226 2018-12-17 20:16:06 So as per SHY we all go back to oil lamps / caves / hunting kangaroos / and collect the unemployment benefits till eternity ?
2227 2018-12-17 20:15:47 For aftercare, try using a massage oil
2228 2018-12-17 20:15:42 The worst part about meeting new people is finding out they actually believe essential oils do more then smell nice... No Susan, I don’t want peppermint oil for my headache-thanks for offering though.
2229 2018-12-17 20:15:42 the painting looks better in person bc it’s oil painting but this is good practice for when i do more digital painting! im really excited for this year bc i think ill grow a lot
2230 2018-12-17 20:15:39 Driving all the way to Fredericksburg for an oil change. But it’s free sooooo.
2231 2018-12-17 20:15:37 argon oil , suave professionals shampoo & conditioner
2232 2018-12-17 20:15:24 ALL media gave him too much free publicity and talk time. They should have immediately started off calling him what he is, a liar, a con man, a snake oil salesman, a thief, a corrupt business man.
2233 2018-12-17 20:15:17 Plus the loans were secured with Oil  blocs which conflicts with accounting treatment and all as they aren't real assets.

2235 2018-12-17 20:15:11 > Most spilling oil is a pollutant...

So is it okay to use a description which is content dependent or not?
2236 2018-12-17 20:14:49 @nenshi The shortest way to bring Alberta's oil to the sea is British Colombia.
If you want to bash someone, turn your eyes and your speaches againt BC. #polcan
2237 2018-12-17 20:14:46 That castor oil serious
2238 2018-12-17 20:14:45 Hopefully the extra money people have for lower oil prices helps save the economy.
2239 2018-12-17 20:14:41 i have the golden rider deck!!!! its like the oil painting version of the rider-waite-smith deck
2240 2018-12-17 20:14:35 Yes but it shoes politician the mistake we made. 
Reagan had tricks brought a little effort to the deficit made the dollar stronger.  California?..No way..Reagan was a idiot.  Shuffled dishonest price gauging foreign trade deals and hadicapped industry no effort USA oil.
2241 2018-12-17 20:14:28 hell naw I don’t like olive oil. I use butter and I cook them just enough to be cooked and not mushy
2242 2018-12-17 20:14:25 It has nothing to do with being green - it’s about phasing out Alberta’s energy industry (if you disbelieve this ask yourself - how come only oil from AB is “dirty”)
2243 2018-12-17 20:14:03 “wine, gossip, money” am I a housewife to an oil tycoon in 2019 or what
2244 2018-12-17 20:14:01 Ce n'est pas fondamentalement une question d'orthographe, mais de morphologie: le dialecte arpitan revendiqué par @fanfouaie préconise en effet l'apocope du groupe verbal. Ce qui n'est nullement le cas dans ma langue d'oïl à moué.
2245 2018-12-17 20:13:40 I understand what your going through. I lost my dad from that ad well! But don’t loose faith because after his diagnosis we had him almost 20 years! There are treatments and medications that help! My dad loved organic peppermint oil when he was having difficulty breathing.
2246 2018-12-17 20:13:29 Funny, I distinctly remember hearing that any oil money was a bonus.

Oil price fluctuates, it happens. Jam today, caviar tomorrow. All the more reason the oil money should have been invested not squandered on vanity projects in London and south east.
2247 2018-12-17 20:13:04 I can't even understand your link between 'peak oil' and 'UK due to become massively wealthy'. 'Peak oil' refers to (in this case UKCS) production, not tax revenue. It happened in 1999, has been declining ever since, and will continue to.
2248 2018-12-17 20:12:58 We just legalized it in Michigan for recreational use in November but we’ve had medical for a long time now... i have my medical card and let me tell you, it’s been sooooo nice to go in to a store and buy my flower and oil, free of fear!!
2249 2018-12-17 20:12:56 2/3 Preheat oven to 375
Soak bread in milk 
Pulse mushrooms in food processor to pea sized. Put onion, peppers, celery, in skillet to saute. Then add mushrooms. Add spices to pan to bloom in oil, if you wish deglaze  Pan with a bit of red wine add to bread milk mixture 2/3
2250 2018-12-17 20:12:46 Still havn't bought shit .. Wantsome oil stocks or Etfs
2251 2018-12-17 20:12:39 What world are we in where a snake oil salesman has Americans attacking the US department of justice to defend traitors?  The books about this era are gonna be embarrassing.
2252 2018-12-17 20:12:35 Suport for the oil and gas industry.
2253 2018-12-17 20:12:30 Fish oil helps growth
2254 2018-12-17 20:12:27 Absolutely. Going to try Sesame oil tonight which is at 450F - if I can get a serious crust - I'll stick with that. Using the skillet though to maximize it.
2255 2018-12-17 20:12:09 Most spilling oil is a pollutant, but in general the word pollutant isn’t context-independent enough to describe things. You cannot ask "is it a pollutant?" without first stating what could get polluted.

2258 2018-12-17 20:11:51 Juice parachute ka coconut oil..
2259 2018-12-17 20:11:50 PA, your car needed some oil 
2260 2018-12-17 20:11:49 You bet, I was there. Was supposed to be pro oil and gas, turned a little into anti-federal government, but nothing to do with the yellow vest movement (which arguably isn't clear in Canada) other than some people wearing them
2261 2018-12-17 20:11:44 Walmart got a version of dr. Bronners soap? Walmart is ripping trees and box'n orangoutangs in the face for their oil, I'm good.
2262 2018-12-17 20:11:40 Oil ok
2263 2018-12-17 20:11:25 Depends on you you define success. He worked for an oil company, served in WW2 and Korea. He had a successful business in Louisiana and raised 3 productive kids. He wanted for nothing, he had everything he needed.
2264 2018-12-17 20:11:21 The greatest asset, even in this country, is not oil and gas. It's integrity. Everyone is searching for it, asking, 'Who can I do business with that I can trust?' (George Foreman)
2265 2018-12-17 20:11:19 U.S. shale oil output to top 8 mln bpd by year-end: EIA :RTRS 

US will balance the supply cut by opec if shale output keeps going up.
2266 2018-12-17 20:11:09 I will concede the food is better than Tim's but the coffee is boiling hot crude oil
2267 2018-12-17 20:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza for lunch today will be: chewy crust with sweet motor oil and philly beef.
2268 2018-12-17 20:11:04 I think the same thing happened in the oil market when a lot of speculative traders put on leveraged positions in advance of the Iran sanctions and then got crushed when Trump gave out exemptions to eight countries.  Now they are puking out their long positions in oil.
2269 2018-12-17 20:11:02 every time i go to take 5 oil change i’m so impressed

2272 2018-12-17 20:10:50 when the avuncular guy behind the counter tops your baba ghanouj with extra olive oil.... That's when you know you've made it
2273 2018-12-17 20:10:41 Full strength cannabis oil is fairly easy to make. Get yourself a source of good flowers and get an extractor machine. Heard good things about Magic Butter machines
2274 2018-12-17 20:10:40 I’m way more offended by the Palm oil in it

2277 2018-12-17 20:10:25 @StephenMillerAL Are you kidding me with that spray job on your noggin.  I hope it was oil based so it wouldn't run when it rains.

2282 2018-12-17 20:09:56 No joke. I called around asking how I can ship a bottle of alcohol today (still trying to figure it out btw) and the @UPS guy on the phone told me that they can't ship alcohol, but they can ship a bottle of vinegar or olive oil....and then he verbally said "wink, wink!"
2283 2018-12-17 20:09:55 Omg almost 3 hours and 80$ later to get an oil changed and tires rotated!

2288 2018-12-17 20:09:37 Yes I have travelled thanks. Much of my travel being to deploy on ops, in service of my country over 23 years.  Thereafter I worked on ships in oil and gas industry a few years You just don't get it. We voted to do our our own trade deals and to trade on our own terms. #Brexit

It’s time for a divorce. U keep your intersectionality, identity politics, open borders, socialist BS. 

We’ll keep limited government, freedom of speech, secure borders, & 2A. 

U can also keep Silicon Valley, but we’re taking the oil
2294 2018-12-17 20:09:09 どうしたのだ
2295 2018-12-17 20:09:04 Great... now I'll have to deal with that horrid skunk stench even more so every fucking where I go. Cuomo, I'm a pot hating Democrat, please just legalize it for cannabinoid oil use and medical reasons!! New York doesn't need anymore lung pollution!!!

2299 2018-12-17 20:08:50 How would they get the oil out of their landlocked country?
2300 2018-12-17 20:08:42 I got lucky in 2008 and worked threw it but when oil crashed at end of 2014 that’s when everything changed. These companies learned a lot in 2014 though and do things for that not to happen again.

£2,478 debt per person in the oil capital of Europe never mind the rest of our wonderful resources, you've just won the hypocritical idiot of the day award on twitter  well played. Scottish unionists are the most NAIVE people
2303 2018-12-17 20:08:25 Totally Agree. Mozart is Best, Beethoven is very good but no Bach. Brahms is da worst. “I have never understood Brahms,” Einstein is reported to have said. “I believe Brahms was burning the midnight oil trying to be complicated.”
2304 2018-12-17 20:08:20 We should consider Tweaking one of our current products like the Injector Cleaner, Water or Moisture causes rust on Injectors distorting the spray pattern. Then I won't have to get STP fuel treatment in the red bottle.
2305 2018-12-17 20:08:13 Hi Ali:  I am a fan since you were at CNN and I watch you everyday.  I like you for your knowledge on finances and politics and above all, for your objectivity.  However, when it comes to Tesla, you have chosen, probably unwittingly,  to follow the herd, aka the oil companies.
2306 2018-12-17 20:07:54 Is that so? Well, Kinder Morgan paid no taxes to Canada in 2007, but we sure the hell subsidized them quite generously. Wanna tell which oil corp you work for?
2307 2018-12-17 20:07:42 USA has no oil? 
We built this country off slavery? 
I gave Trump a shove.said build YOUR wall. Panama

2309 2018-12-17 20:07:29 Technology not advance enough to escape all the sully they put in place with oil and gas is it Pence
2310 2018-12-17 20:07:27 Of course you're a death cultist. Why are you spending your time being a pathetic troll for Big Oil if not because you're a death cultist?
2311 2018-12-17 20:07:22 But but but @gmbutts just said Canada doesn’t import Saudi oil?
2312 2018-12-17 20:07:19 And I remember all the promises about Scotland being a rich nation and living off its oil....shortly after the vote to stay with the U.K. the oil price crashed. Lucky escape for Scotland....
2313 2018-12-17 20:07:16 Always making the same mistakes smh- I’ll bring 4 books and 2 journals to my oil change, decide against most of them when I get to the mechanic, and end up scrolling for 45 minutes anyways. Every time.

2318 2018-12-17 20:06:51 Have You Ever Gotten Olive Oil Served To You In A Vodka Glass? Well,
2319 2018-12-17 20:06:47 Told you when my system gave LONG signal on $ORG that was a SELL on oil!
2320 2018-12-17 20:06:41 Back on my coconut oil bullshit 
2321 2018-12-17 20:06:29 #EIA predict wrong, with this low oil price shale production will retard rather much.
2322 2018-12-17 20:06:28 like i get the blocked oil glands occasionally but never this many
2323 2018-12-17 20:06:19 Shit suck they ain’t got sauce niggaz got oil lmao
2324 2018-12-17 20:06:13 You know I will have to consult my texts on this when I get home to see what happened. Olive Oil is still a vegetable oil, and other than a low smoke point, should be fine. In fact you can get extra light olive oil for less flavor impact.
2325 2018-12-17 20:06:12 @officialEFCC I am in the middle of an international oil transaction. I am facilitating the sale and purchase of D2(Light Diesel). 
And should the buyer and seller agree to sell and buy,I am entitled to a commission which would amount to millions in Nigerian currency.
2326 2018-12-17 20:05:57 The wider picture, US IS SUPPORTING ISIS TO DIVERT ATTENTION WHILE THEY STEAL OIL
2327 2018-12-17 20:05:54 Who cooks a fried egg and the oil splatted and hit eye lid...  oh that’s me
2328 2018-12-17 20:05:52 Still a pre-Christmas laughter for oil industry...sorry.. even if next month will be 100 electric buses more. There is still an order for 600 diesel fueled buses by the same government.
2329 2018-12-17 20:05:49 HUH
SHE WENT TO GO GET HER 
OIL CHANGED AT LEXUS 
IN UNION CITY..
I THINK (1PM APPOINTMENT)
2330 2018-12-17 20:05:47 A hydro stike is absolutely intolerable! My mother had thousands of dollars in damage to her home almost 40 years ago from a Quebec Hydro strike. Loss of sump pump, rising basement water, flooded furnace, and oil water heater, sub-zero temperatures! Perfectly timed for screwing.
2331 2018-12-17 20:05:44 @waitrose lovely Beet Wellington - but what a shame yet more #PalmOil In your ingredients. Can't sunflower or rapeseed oil produced in uk be used instead?
2332 2018-12-17 20:05:44 the reason it’s so cheap now is because we’re pumping our own oil instead of buying it from the middle east.
2333 2018-12-17 20:05:35 If you're searching for criminals, courtrooms and jails seem like top two logical places to look for them.
2334 2018-12-17 20:05:14 Importing oil when our industry challenged a baseless claim...uhhh 
2335 2018-12-17 20:04:58 Made one today but don't think their is any special way for me you blend your tomatoes pepper , onions, chilli pepper together boil till it's a bit dry add groundnut oil or bleached palm oil then your perboiled or fried fish or meat add your spices leave for some minutes . 
2336 2018-12-17 20:04:58 Only if you understand economics and how oil prices work. Supply and demand should put CA higher in big cities but in rural areas, lower, however it doesn't work that way with gasoline. Go figure.
2337 2018-12-17 20:04:56 yeTh use only a little oil and cook until it becomes brown and crithpy
2338 2018-12-17 20:04:27 From someone who loves cheese it’s completely different. Probably ok in its own right but it’s a shit substitute. Probably just as bad for you too, it’s just oil with other stuff.

2340 2018-12-17 20:04:22 He makes no sense. Still going to give Saudis 17billion for their dirty oil. He is doing this solely because Ford is not taking his BS! It's an attack on the people of Ontario and sure hope they retaliate!

2343 2018-12-17 20:04:07 yup, 94% comes from Canada and US.

If they have a problem with the other 6% bring that up with the oil companies who are the ones who make the decisions.
2344 2018-12-17 20:04:03 I mean…it should work? Burn temp might be an issue. I think olive oil runs low compared to canola.
2345 2018-12-17 20:03:59 I think i need a husband simply to have someone to remind me when to get my oil changed
2346 2018-12-17 20:03:50 That’s what your oil is now lol
2347 2018-12-17 20:03:49 Just ordered hemp oil because I hate taking pharmaceuticals. It will arrive on Christmas Eve which is perfect because I have to spend it with my mother. Hopefully it will calm my anxiety because she makes me nuts.
2348 2018-12-17 20:03:42 either, and current American foreign policy isn't about race, is about gaining advantage over competing countries, access to resources, oil and natural gas pipelines etc.

Your lectures simply ring hollow, compared with reality.

2352 2018-12-17 20:03:28 He was killed for Libyan oil and his socialist programs, they said he’s a dictator, he had a vision for Africa with no face buying, Libya now is enslaving its ppl, Africa lost a true leader, sharing the wealth of the country with ppl is Better than enriching ur own family
2353 2018-12-17 20:03:26 Raise the price of oil! We do not want another recession.
2354 2018-12-17 20:03:16 BigGAN oil paintings
2355 2018-12-17 20:02:52 I feel like trump wants oil cheap because that's the number 1 expense for average American if oil was high and stock market rocky people would be rioting just my 2 cents
2356 2018-12-17 20:02:51 You mean bought the title with Arab oil money?

Cbd oil works. When u take it ..be patient.. it does work. There are thousands and thousands of people that it helps. Seek it out.
2360 2018-12-17 20:02:16 By appointment only?  I guess the goal is to not be competitive in the oil change/tire rotation business @NTB
2361 2018-12-17 20:02:12 Coming up with a new damage type to explain an occult and ancient oil that erodes your soul rather than your body when you touch it
2362 2018-12-17 20:01:24 Yes dumping shit into the river and receiving oil via diesel tanker across Atlantic the environmental thing to do 
2363 2018-12-17 20:01:20 @realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls @PressSec my guess is a lot of retired folks are tired getting up every a.m.watching their CIC in daily drama,our 401k's losing value,and oil prices going down the tubes just as a lot of folks got back into working good paying jobs in oil field.
2364 2018-12-17 20:01:19 The Price Of Oil Going Down This Much Is Terrible For The Economy! It Will Put A Massive Amount of People Out Of Work. It Will Trickle Down And Affect All BUSINESSES.

2366 2018-12-17 20:01:00 Why do we have to subsidize the freedom of the seas so that China can ship oil from the Middle Ease back to East Asia? At some point we will figure out that we don't need to anymore.

Dad discovered you cannot accidentally use olive oil instead of vegetable in the recipe and expect it to bake...pretty much at all

2379 2018-12-17 20:00:17 Al Gore said all of the ice in the Arctic would be gone by 6 years ago. He was wrong. Specific heat capacity explains the temperature measurement as inconsequential. At what point do people call out climate change for the snake oil ruse that it is?
2380 2018-12-17 20:00:09 Twitter gotta chill on the dry snitching.
My followers dont need to know I follow baby oil covered, big booty pages & shit.
2381 2018-12-17 19:59:50 Or abiotic oil people vs a geologist. If you haven’t heard about it look it up. You won’t be disappointed.
2382 2018-12-17 19:59:50 Until,the next deplorable lobbyist for oil and gas interests fills the cabinet post.
2383 2018-12-17 19:59:45 Snake oil salesmen never left. They just got news shows.
2384 2018-12-17 19:59:42 Watch for some type of "prop up" mechanism for crude oil soon. Remember, the banks have HUGE investments in crude and they will not be allowed to take losses...
2385 2018-12-17 19:59:24 No.  My oil equities are still getting crushed.   Thanks Trump. Just what he wanted lower oil. Hey Trump hows that’s lower oil working out for stock market.  He is such a Bafoon.
2386 2018-12-17 19:59:22 breakfast lunch dinner semua sini wajib salad and olive oil
2387 2018-12-17 19:59:22 Anyone at his position would have done the same with the amount of oil in Libyan soil, countries with comparable oil reserves had much better outcomes, like UAE, Qatar, etc. Gaddafi was a criminal, his good deeds were not exceptional considering how much oil Libya had.
2388 2018-12-17 19:59:22 Stop smiling, it makes you look even more “snake oil salesmany” #Panorama
2389 2018-12-17 19:59:19 The issues are not outside the GOP tent but they never made any attempt to address them. Trump took them head on & has paid a personal price  in millions of dollars in lost business, lawsuits, now a criminal litigation. Manufacturing has come back, leading oil/gas producer status
2390 2018-12-17 19:59:03 That’s not a very bold prediction with him struggling and being UFA at year end.
2391 2018-12-17 19:59:03 Bravo Mr Dumont, je suis Quebecois de naissance vivant en Alberta depuis 2014 et travaille dans le “gas and oil” les gens n’ont aucune idée les moyens déployées par les compagnies de pétrole pour l’environnement.
2392 2018-12-17 19:58:56 True enough on all counts there. Province as a whole has to diversify, and the sad part is the province didn't capitalize much on the boom times. Instead oil companies ripped that profit out of Alberta and took it elsewhere, barely paying taxes.
2393 2018-12-17 19:58:52 Very good news. It's about time we got back to the fundamentals of supply/demand in oil markets - rather than being driven by big bets for/against major currencies etc
2394 2018-12-17 19:58:49 Wow! You're not doing your state any good by selling out to the oil companies. I thought the earthquake would have shaken up your sense of urgency about climate change, but, sadly, you are a colossal disappointment to Alaskans. 
Today would be a good day for you to resign.

2397 2018-12-17 19:58:35 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
2398 2018-12-17 19:58:32 I just made a round trip between New Mexico and the Texas Gulf Coast. I saw oil, oil , and more oil. Distribution at Corpus Christi, tracking in Big Springs, pumping everywhere, oil tankers on the road, oil stink everywhere.
2399 2018-12-17 19:58:23 Yes. Heavy, untreated except by multiple rounds of bacon, chicken, and beef preparations with olive oil, butter, or lard.  No washing with soap in between, but by scrapping and scrubbing with Rock Salt and clean water.  The original "non-stick" surface.
2400 2018-12-17 19:58:18 I'm curious how the great independent country of Albertastan would get their oil out of the country.
2401 2018-12-17 19:58:15 By potential, are you factoring in clubroot, sclerotenia, pod shatter resistance? High oleic oil content? All brought to us by breeding. It’s not all about yield.
2402 2018-12-17 19:58:14 I hear ya, but it doesnt work that way in sports. Flyers quit under Hakstol, Eagles quit under Chip, and I think the Phillies started to quit on Capt Coconut Oil
2403 2018-12-17 19:58:06 I need a fake man for the sole purpose of going to get an oil change
2404 2018-12-17 19:58:02 If Lidia Bastianich has said it once, she has said it a thousand times: she has absolutely NO damn patience for people that a) break their pasta in half b) put olive oil in the pasta water c) use the spoon/fork combo for eating pasta.
2405 2018-12-17 19:58:02 Why doesn’t anybody talk about Natural Gas in Alberta or do you think it’s lumped in with Oil?
2406 2018-12-17 19:57:41 Thanks for reminding me to schedule an oil change lmao
2407 2018-12-17 19:57:38 For oil.

2409 2018-12-17 19:57:19 I been needed a oil change. I ain’t never wait this late. I’m so embarrassed for these people to go under my hood. 
2410 2018-12-17 19:56:57 I saw a very interesting documentary on why electric cars have constantly been blocked for many years by lobbyists. Too much to go into in detail here, but obviously oil companies have an interest in stopping or at least restricting them.
2411 2018-12-17 19:56:50 Axis of oil
2412 2018-12-17 19:56:49 I put my headphones in as soon as I pull up for an oil change
2413 2018-12-17 19:56:48 Y’all can call me Olive Oil cause I’m gonna be extra virgin going into 2019
2414 2018-12-17 19:56:42 Which one are you at? Ya girl needs her oil changed  i tried to call and they did not answer
2415 2018-12-17 19:56:38 the oil should be between 350 F and 375 F or your massage will absorb too much oil.
2416 2018-12-17 19:56:33 @CDCgov 
IS IT TRUE THAT OLIVE OIL IS SOMETIMES MIXED WITH GOLD THAT SETTLES TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BOTTLE AND DOES NOT DISSIPATE THE HEALING GOLD?
2417 2018-12-17 19:56:33 Oil subsidy!
2418 2018-12-17 19:56:26 These are the kind of rallies you see from the NRA conventions in the States whereupon insecure people are driven into a paranoid state of losing their beloved oil and gas, just like NRA there is no threat but lets cause chaos #weneedtogrowtogreen
2419 2018-12-17 19:56:23 Yeah, my husband and I are trying to decide where to spend our new “riches.” Let’s see: drug store, oil company, grocery store? So many to chose from.
2420 2018-12-17 19:56:08 @BloombergHT Bu son düşüşle WTI Crude Oil için 45,00 USD kapısı aralandı mı acaba?
2421 2018-12-17 19:55:55 It league wide.Did you watch or see the Jets/Tampa game last night? Get over it.
2422 2018-12-17 19:55:50 I wouldn't say the industry is dying, but the corporations are cost cutting to make even more profit. It's going to hit the oil sands extremely hard in a few years.
2423 2018-12-17 19:55:44 What about the hundreds of millions$  in oil & gas subsidies Republicans gave- HUGE FOR DECADES!  Americans WANT clean energy. Mr Barrasso, how much $$$ did you get for pushing the TAX SCAM thru Congress w huge tax cuts for fossil fuels & pipeline co. #DIRTY
2424 2018-12-17 19:55:34 You have forgotten to add how a whole vessle of crude oil disappeared in Nigerian water.  Or how Tompolo became defence contractor or how CAN president private jet was used to launder cash under guise of arms purchase. PDP ought to be proscribed for economic sabotage
2425 2018-12-17 19:55:31 I got my oil changed and my car has been done and parked for a good 20+ minutes and they keep telling me it’s “almost done”...

2431 2018-12-17 19:55:14 You're saying a 30% overdevelopment in real estate and increasing reliance on automation in the over fetishised oil industry are Rachel Notley's fault and not the fault of CEOs and developers who got rich during and boom and skipped town when it went bust?

Weird.

2439 2018-12-17 19:54:38 Ok well let's start with the ingredients, this thing is dense with it. It's a heavy package and they add more things than your typical cup. The broth is noticeably better than American brands, and has a little more sesame oil to help seperate noodles and add flavor.
2440 2018-12-17 19:54:38 Where can I get a oil change at over east ???
2441 2018-12-17 19:54:37 It’s not rly oily, there’s only a lil tiny bit of sesame oil at the end. It’s mostly like a vinegar consistency but it’s usually packed full of like, spring onion greens and crushed garlic cloves and chilli flakes. I add honey or a bit of sugar to balance out the soy sauce too
2442 2018-12-17 19:54:25 @HHMansoor Asc akh idk who’s involved in the investment committee but y’all need to congregate and buy the @nyknicks. Y’all can Promote Dubai trips and premium products too. I know y’all trying to shift away from oil dependency my G. Follow back so we can connect.

2445 2018-12-17 19:54:21 Marijuana for recr use and home growing is legal in Canada. Hemp too. Both plants have great medical and health benefits. Hemp is likely the far bigger economic benefit; also having super strength fibre, nutritional oil (Omega-3!), fast growth, no need for Monsanto's toxins.
2446 2018-12-17 19:54:21 Rex Tillerson is now the front runner for Secretary of State. Follow along closely. He is the CEO of Exxon/Mobile who just so happened to strike oil in Russia's arctic region. Exxons partner you ask? Rosneft. Who is Rosneft? They are the worlds largest publicly traded petroleum
2447 2018-12-17 19:54:20 My understanding is that Saudi oil that is refined in NB is sold in Quebec through Irving’s retail gas stations. They may not refine it but the still support Saudi oil by using their fuel.

2451 2018-12-17 19:53:47 That’s the thing, many Central American asylum seekers are fleeing murder, violence, and land theft which is supported by oil and mineral extraction companies.  #refugees
2452 2018-12-17 19:53:45 I have a really good black dermatologist who wrote me a perscption for vitamins and this mosturizer that really changed the game!!! But Ambi black soap, witch hazel and cetaphil oil control are products I buy in the store
2453 2018-12-17 19:53:39 I work with a bunch of brilliant millennials, maybe your job cheaps out and can only hire the stupider people regardless of their generation? There are Boomers who can't change a tire or their oil or check their email. I don't go around acting like they're all like that.
2454 2018-12-17 19:53:38 $OIL prices coitnue to slide
anybody recall oil and commodity prices before the 2007 2008 great recession?
the market is trying hard to be ahead of the late 2019 early 2020 recession
and this is the canary in the coal mine
2455 2018-12-17 19:53:23 Beautiful day, come by and get an oil change!
2456 2018-12-17 19:53:21 the mechanic at the oil change place said my perfume smells hella good but i’m not wearing perfume
2457 2018-12-17 19:53:10 I did not even put any money on all MJ stock $WEED $CGC $ACB $APHA $CRON. #Oil $WTIC down and broke the 50 support. I actually took a nap for 1 hour and woke up. Cash is a excellent position today and hopefully tomorrow is a better day for the markets
2458 2018-12-17 19:53:04 Do #Putin in 3 steps: 1.Freeze all Russian assets in US. 2. Go Green & tank Rus mono-economy based on OIL. 3.Hack Kremlin back to the Siberian stone age
2459 2018-12-17 19:52:57 I know the details of the ship,All of the Greenpeace cruising fleet use oil it is hypocritical of them.
2460 2018-12-17 19:52:54 His con is one of the oldest, same as the snake oil salesmen.
2461 2018-12-17 19:52:53 Enbridge line 9 carries 300,000 BPD from Sarnia, On to Montreal. That comes from the existing pipeline from Alberta, and also US oil. Canada exported 3.3 million barrels per day to the U.S. in 2017, 99.9% from western Canada
2462 2018-12-17 19:52:50 You can create a mist, using purified water & then only maybe 2-5 drops of jasmine oil. Or a massage oil, like part coconut or jojoba oil and 2-5 drops of jasmine and use on lower back and thighs. Really soft and light usage.  just smelling is really great too!
2463 2018-12-17 19:52:50 And how are you supposed to track and check the welfare of these children If you dont know who they are with, where they are?
Most of "missing" children given to ppl that dont report back, move and are illegal themselves. Then ppl outraged they're "missing."
2464 2018-12-17 19:52:48 ikrrrrr going to get an oil change or some shit and they see an easy target saying oh all this and this isn’t working when you know damn well it’s fine 
2465 2018-12-17 19:52:45 They are so amazing  I wrap bacon around asparagus, glaze them with olive oil. Then on the grill. To go with. What's you favorite kinda food?
2466 2018-12-17 19:52:43 Obama sidestepped world conflicts wherever he could. We spent ourselves into bankruptcy fighting for Bush's oil. Some say 9/11 deliberate-we knew ahead. Why start another?GOP no help;denied embssy sec requests. Perhaps protest, debacle of Ukraine may have had different ending.
2467 2018-12-17 19:52:30 1 Hectare of Industrial Hemp yields a few thousand barrels of oil from the crushed seeds. Can either be used as cooking oil or be clean processed for burn with no emissions. Both are in direct response to SDGs
2468 2018-12-17 19:52:29 Pey always would pull them out and spill oil everywhere 
2469 2018-12-17 19:52:23 Just finished watching #TheApprentice final and it was excellent. 

It's been a brilliant series with 2 exceptional finalists but I think the best woman won

Don't think I've ever wished well to all the contestants before but this year I do. Even the modern day snake oil salesman
2470 2018-12-17 19:52:21 Low oil prices hurt Russia more.
2471 2018-12-17 19:52:13 While welcome news this is pure green washing. 

Today is also the day Alberta will export over 3,000,000 barrels of oil. This will be repeated tomorrow. And the day after that... 

What steps AB takes to green its grid are tiny compared to the carbon footprint of its exports.
2472 2018-12-17 19:52:12 No the current Liberal government is the same as their horseshit predecessors. More corporatism, more oil pipelines, more horrific trade deals. Stop pretending they're fundamentally different in any way.
2473 2018-12-17 19:52:02 Got oil all over me today 
2474 2018-12-17 19:51:29 Oil drops as oversupply, economic growth worries weigh: Oil prices fell about 1 percent on Monday… @environmentguru
2475 2018-12-17 19:51:06 Trump has an exceedingly good idea of what he is doing.  The problem is what he is doing is manipulating people into supporting him for no real gain by our nation.  Simply because someone is a brilliant snake oil salesman does not mean that they are not brilliant at snakeoil.
2476 2018-12-17 19:50:55 I'm sorry you're going through this. I have a relative suffering from it as well. She's told me that what's helped her the most is CBD oil & smoking weed. I don't know your feelings on that, just figured I'd mention it.

2478 2018-12-17 19:50:50 I keep getting adverts here from an oil company boasting about funding research on 'carbon capture technology' . I haven't clicked, but I assume they're talking about planting trees
2479 2018-12-17 19:50:47 U.S. #oil price benchmark #WTI settles below $50 a barrel on Monday for the first time since October 2017
2480 2018-12-17 19:50:36 .End all arms sales to #SaudiArabia, and stop buying its bloody oil!

2483 2018-12-17 19:50:28 I’m at the car dealership getting my oil changed and every song on their radio is from, like, mid 2000’s
2484 2018-12-17 19:50:20 1. Pure vegetable oil
2. Mamador spread (margarine)
2485 2018-12-17 19:50:15 CBD oil is actually a life saver
2486 2018-12-17 19:50:13 Yes! I admit I did google a recipe  and you just halve them, toss in oil and salt and roast for about half an hour. They were so tasty!
2487 2018-12-17 19:50:09 Finally getting my car that oil change it needed 4000 miles ago
2488 2018-12-17 19:50:01 Getting an oil change.. found out my breaks are literally on their last leg.. so my $30 oil change turned into a $150 break change.. I'm fucking dying.. doubtful I'll get back to arkansas for Christmas now. 
2489 2018-12-17 19:49:57 #DiscoverCetaphil #ThanksCetaphil #TheInsidersUK Good for post-shave moisturising with the day cream. The night cream is good for dry patches at night. Apply the hand cream when skin is dry. Body cream for knees and elbows. Cleanser to remove dirt and oil from face.
2490 2018-12-17 19:49:55 trade war little to do with it, ignore the hype. tariff induced inflation to consumer is minimal. this is all to do with rates, housing, and oil
2491 2018-12-17 19:49:54 Unfortunate that it's such a poorly written article. 'Destructed' ? Plus are the EU really planning to ban all palm oil products? This would be an environmental disaster. We need efficient food sources- we don't need biofuel cars.
2492 2018-12-17 19:49:47 A winter treat is making proper popcorn: fry the kernels lightly in chilli-infused oil in a big pot with a lid (pref glass, so you can watch them bounce) then drizzle with maple syrup...

2497 2018-12-17 19:49:25 Ah this is such good news! Keep your fingers crossed for me (I’d keep my own crossed but they are waiting for the CBD oil to kick in ) x
2498 2018-12-17 19:49:24 Suing oil, gas and pipeline companies because of the weather makes about as much sense as suing farmers and grocery stores because you’re obese.
2499 2018-12-17 19:49:11 Hmm, I might have dunked up the oil ratio in my clay mix. I guess we'll see if it's still usable tomorrow.
2500 2018-12-17 19:49:11 I don't know why I feel my poor @ManUtd can eliminate 'oil money launders' PSG. A date has been booked... damn!

2505 2018-12-17 19:48:34 I used to get my oil changed at one specific place I tried a new place today and the mechanic I had works at the new place said his wife of 22 years just passed prayers up for him 
2506 2018-12-17 19:48:28 Only takes one spill to destroy our environment. Should be working towards alternative not oil.
2507 2018-12-17 19:48:26 Oil futures end lower, with U.S. prices at their lowest in over a year
2508 2018-12-17 19:48:22 Obviously based on their belief that voters will hand control of the government to the clown car party if they try to shut down dirty oil.
2509 2018-12-17 19:48:20 If the signal from oil dropping below $50 doesn't spook equity traders then they probably aren't going to be that spooked.  Seems a little quixotic to me, but I'm all for Fed magic.
2510 2018-12-17 19:48:18 I can’t believe my dad jst made me change the gen engine oil. He has finally turned me to an handy man

2513 2018-12-17 19:48:16 There is a tsunami coming and any politician seen as not supporting the oil and gas sector will be wiped off the polical map. Count on it.
2514 2018-12-17 19:48:02 @SenatorEnzi yes and your Nazi greed of oil killed my mother, THE STATE OF WYO IS NUMBER ONE IN THE U.S.A FOR CORRUPTION.....GREED OF OIL FOR A PROFIT OF C.M.T....WAKE UP WE THE PEOPLE...
2515 2018-12-17 19:48:01 Don't know which will be worst. Watching LFC win the title while Utd "suffers" or watching city win yet another "Oil-Money-Sponsored" Title
2516 2018-12-17 19:47:39 Problem is people who know nothing about anything, comment or blindly follow. If they think the government can’t do anything about Saudi oil, they’re drinking the koolaid
2517 2018-12-17 19:47:27 Yeah might city wasn't for the oil money would be playing in the championship and all that money still can't get you champions league not even a final

2520 2018-12-17 19:47:10 I have closed my $JPY longs(they were against CAD and USD). I am not gonna fight the tape. Indices down -10%, oil and inflation expectations have plunged, everyone is cutting growth forecasts but the mofo Yen is only up 1 pc-ish. Maybe it is year-end thing IDK but I'm out for now
2521 2018-12-17 19:47:01 This is pretty, it reminds me of an oil painting a bit! It would make a cute Christmas card ^^
2522 2018-12-17 19:46:56 kids are kids broer, they were having funny painting your car with used oil forgive them & take your car to car-wash hope strong chemical will remove that old oil.

It’s not easy and it’s doubly hard on kids just starting out!!
2524 2018-12-17 19:46:51 Can't agree more! Another one I saw today - If data is the new oil, don't you think the owner of this data will protect it like they would precious resource.
2525 2018-12-17 19:46:41 WTIC oil below $50, a good price for everybody is $60 and everybody would be happy, from bottom to top end.
2526 2018-12-17 19:46:11 Druh is a city councilor in the city that was hurt the worst by the downturn in oil prices, she should speak to the ridiculous double standard in this country in which the east would rather import oil from overseas than support its own oil sector.
2527 2018-12-17 19:46:07 Parboil cubed potato then sauté in butter/oil. Remove. Add garlic, ginger, black mustard seeds, cumin and paprika to the hot pan, with a generous squeeze of lemon. Wilt a bag of spinach into the spices then reunite the whole lot with the potatoes.

3. No borders! Make immigration policies good for all

..and if you will, work on a new economic system, Capitalism corrupts
2531 2018-12-17 19:45:56 It is a plain shame decades of Conservative governments in Alberta refused to diversify your economy or save the oil revenues in good times to carry over the bad, in an boom and bust economy. Homeowners plan their budgets better than Albertan Conservative politicians. #cdnpoli
2532 2018-12-17 19:45:54 The shop didn't have pine (needle) oil so I ordered some, I'm hoping it's the extra hit of festive smell I want. Also some charcoal discs because I still have (real!) frankincense and myrrh from years ago, which is excellent if heady.
2533 2018-12-17 19:45:52 for oil?
2534 2018-12-17 19:45:45 The money the @OilGasCanada gives to us is minute compared to what we should be getting and are not getting thanks to the Tapcal Trust Fund PCs who did not build refineries. The window of opportunity is closing for our oil. And we're bankrupt. Our kids inherit the liabilities.
2535 2018-12-17 19:45:41 Coco butter, coco butter baby oil gel,  with Amber/argon oil body butter what’ll have you moisturized and smelling like heaven. Thank me later.

2538 2018-12-17 19:45:33 Thank you for the ethical recognition -- but give us a break on the "dirty". Newer oilsands developments GHG intensity is at the average level of American oil consumed. Upstream oilsands GHG emissions intensity fell by 21 percent from 2009 – 2017, and still falling.

2558 2018-12-17 19:44:33 wonder if Tesla has any idea how much oil is needed to produce the battery that powers their ec... the strip mining done in China to gain the rare earth material needed leaves the land a barren waste... sad the public has NO clue how they are fooled by the 'dream of clean energy,
2559 2018-12-17 19:44:19 No, they were something to behold. you could make boatloads of money. I went to the Sp/Naz/Oil.....much more opportunity. Do yourself a favor and find another thing to trade, make better use of your capital and time
2560 2018-12-17 19:44:18 Even though I don't tweet about it much, I see what's going on in the whole wide world. I see the chaos, the signs. I've been prepping by eating & memorizing Scripture, by drawing closer to Jesus, by proclaiming His Name. Keep your lamps full of oil, beloveds.

2563 2018-12-17 19:43:55 I don't understand this. Hard work is what made this country great.  Burning the midnight oil, burning the candle at both ends, etc. This has been many successful ppl's rallying crys as students and working people. Your post is a contradiction...
2564 2018-12-17 19:43:48 I hope so, can't stand city and the dirty oil money winning again.
2565 2018-12-17 19:43:45 I don't understand how anyone could still be eating anything pulled out of the Gulf, it's a contaminated death zone of driller chemicals and oil spills. If you want kids with flippers and crotch cancer, just keep it up!
2566 2018-12-17 19:43:38 The differences due to processing are interesting.  Any idea where to find that information?  The other challenge is working with high oil/fat materials.  Extraction for testing is trickier and challenging vs. low/no fat.  Leads to data accuracy problems.

2578 2018-12-17 19:42:17 The Irving’s and New Brunswick are big supporters of energy east, were from the get go and hoped to expand their refinery, port to allow for export - they wanted it and still do - they can’t buy Canadian oil now without pipelines so hard to blame them for not buying it
2579 2018-12-17 19:42:12 #Oil getting ugly here... down 3.7% (Feb contract) breaking below $50 level #OOTT $CL #WTI
2580 2018-12-17 19:41:59 Con artist is better. Grifter also works, snake oil salesman, self righteous prick... I could go on.
2581 2018-12-17 19:41:58 My long at 2578 is down 20, but mitigated by #ES_F profits from earlier. My #cl_f long is from Friday because of very poor risk mangement. I believe #es will be profitable. Holding #oil overnight
2582 2018-12-17 19:41:58 It’s nice to have a real, reasoned discussion about this issue on here. I agree, it is a major issue trying to get the balance. I guess I don’t see why we aren’t supporting our own country; everyone gains. My viewpoint is we can curtail use at home and still buy more Cdn oil.
2583 2018-12-17 19:41:48 Jeff Currie of GS who said buy oil 3 weeks ago now says oil says we're headed for a recession

2585 2018-12-17 19:41:42 Hard to believe, but there’s a fair bit of opposition from cranks under the guise of “health freedom.” Wouldn’t be surprised to see an IT op-ed any day now, whinging about bullies & trolls  infringing on their right to sell snake oil.

2587 2018-12-17 19:41:35 M you must be young, I remember when Trudeau senior nationalized a bunch of companies so that the government did buy oil to make gas. Now governments just impede industry

2597 2018-12-17 19:40:45 You're just going to ignore "Tariff man" and his trade WAR with China, our soldiers are still being killed by ISIS, N.Korea is still producing missiles, Tax cuts for the RICH. Oil is low because Saudi Arabia killed a journalists and Trump condones it. Oh, and kids are in cages
2598 2018-12-17 19:40:44 Then let's cut all diplomatic ties. Screw them AND their oil. If more Americans thought about what's good for everyone instead of ME, ME, ME, we would have an energy policy that frees us from foreign oil. Seems like they were talking about that during the freaking Nixon admin.
2599 2018-12-17 19:40:43 Rwanda doesn’t have gold, diamonds, platinum, chrome etc. They have a smart leader! They are currently 1000 times better than Zim. No petrol queues and no cooking oil shortage. Doesn’t ED get embarrassed when he visits some of these progressive African countries?
2600 2018-12-17 19:40:30 Even Notley realizes how fucked up this province is now and she was standing at those anti-Oil protests 5 years ago. Oil & Gas workers are being pushed into a corner for no reason. If you can’t see it you either don’t understand or are too ignorant to try and understand.
2601 2018-12-17 19:40:28 I'm still here and oil is in the shitter.
good luck tho bro.
2602 2018-12-17 19:40:28 This is the argument that the anti CDN oil activists simply don’t have an answer for, they want to kill the CDN oil sector yet they still use oil everyday. To them their agenda of killing our sector outweighs any of the atrocities committed by those we currently import oil from

2612 2018-12-17 19:39:56 Sadly Venezuela. More corporate America though with govt backing. Another reason for greater regulation of oil and gas.
2613 2018-12-17 19:39:39 @realDoanldTramp there is a rumor going around that says you were offered 19% commission on all sales from Rosenflet the Russian oil conglomerate? Is that true? You deleting sanctions so you could make money? Isn't that a conspiracy between you and the Russians? You tell me.

2623 2018-12-17 19:38:33 I understand this chart to describe ‘imports’ to Quebec; Alberta oil is not ‘imported’ so not on the chart.

2634 2018-12-17 19:37:48 Very strange, From the Morneau tweet to this article and Ontario credit downgrade. You don't even need to mention all this, if all is well. Might as well be hyping the strength of Canada's oil industry in 2013-4

2637 2018-12-17 19:37:10 Yeah, I spent 7 yrs on expat duty in Norway.
They have about 5m people with over half of EU's oil and gas reserves and so much excess hydropower, that after smelting most of the world's aluminum ore, they export electricity via subsea cables.
And US health care is better.
2638 2018-12-17 19:37:07 Always swear by Comfrey Oil, brilliant stuff for bruising !
2639 2018-12-17 19:37:03 The pipelines are as much about replacing foreign oil with Canadian as it is to export our oil to more than one market at a discount - the entire country is losing billions that could help pay for healthcare, education, infrastructure etc etc every year but you think that’s good?
2640 2018-12-17 19:37:02 Tomi Lahern is the oil painting in Kaitlin Bennett's attic.
2641 2018-12-17 19:37:02 Have the oil traders moved to the S&P pit with their sell tickets?
2642 2018-12-17 19:36:55 In a way he's right. He tried to limit oil production to increase the price. He admitted as much. He failed.

Obama's failure lead to the oil boom.

2651 2018-12-17 19:36:17 no experience with essential oils and babies! however, I'd say look into putting Eucalyptus, Pepermint, and Tea tree oil in a diffuser for him! all have wonderful properties to target a cold as well as it's pesky symptoms. with a diffuser, there's no risk of skincare irritation
2652 2018-12-17 19:36:17 Wall Street, Big Pharma, Big Oil should not be running or calling the shots-you take their money-you owe them
2653 2018-12-17 19:36:16 It's that sort of thinking that creates real problems. Neither is a disaster. $50 oil isn't good but not a disaster.

2660 2018-12-17 19:35:45 Hydro is reliable; solar/wind is parasite.
It's possible to power a whole region(>10,000 inhabitants) only with hydro without solar/wind, but it's almost impossible(at least economically) to power a region with only solar/wind without coal/oil/gas to compensate intermittencies.
2661 2018-12-17 19:35:36 Welldone. ...but sort the economy out....it's all well and good being sharp answered. .but we sell less than one million barrels of oil compare to Saudis 11 million. .please sort this out...
2662 2018-12-17 19:35:31 The socioeconomic, humanitarian, national security and foreign policy issues surrounding immigration generally are far more complex than wall or no wall. It's a multifaceted issue that needs addressing point by point. No "comprehensive"  solution is possible
2663 2018-12-17 19:35:30 Not to take anything away from Kitchens but he has had the luxury of succeding Hue. Hue is lousy coach. He is not an offensive guru. He is not a QB whisperer. He is a snake oil selling con man. Haley as well  He had Ben, Bell, and Brown and a solid OL Only Hue could screw that up

2665 2018-12-17 19:35:08 One day the United States will ban and shut down and seize all catholic property and rid our country of this pedophile club hiding behind the icons of religion no different than the mafia hiding behind olive oil importing. #ricolaws

2669 2018-12-17 19:34:48 would prefer to see Quebec get its  Saudi oil imported  rather than Buy it from trump and the usa  at the same time it would be even better if the oil we got came from off the coast of Newfoundland......  @JustinTrudeau
2670 2018-12-17 19:34:47 Why do you use heat. Even burning wood. Why do you drive or use hot water or cook? How could you cop down a tree or purchase anything with palm oil or teakwood or paper!  If you advocate against human driven climate change you must sit in a bubble and do nothing.
2671 2018-12-17 19:34:45 Very, very true, yet we do not need oil, there is free energy that has been around for fifty years. This is the elite controller getting richer. How much does a person, a human person need to be? It's idiotic that children are starving while millionaires and billionaires live.
2672 2018-12-17 19:34:32 I need an oil change

2678 2018-12-17 19:34:19 Of course not and no one is saying that, but apparently you think selling our oil to only one market at a huge discount is good  The maritimes still get most of their oil from depots and a lot goes to Quebec after being refined - it’s moronic for us to that

#yyccc where are the clauses promoting Calgary as an energy leader in cleantech? This would have been the perfect opportunity to offer a path forward to transition away from our desperate reliance on the oil industry.

2690 2018-12-17 19:33:22 It took Buhari and his presidential team including his APC vuvuzelas SIX months to peruse GEJ’s handover notes b4 appointing ministers.

2697 2018-12-17 19:32:40 A tale of two exits .it was the best of times it was the worst of times, Its two years since the "it's oor oil party" forced jokexit by a 52% - 48% referendum result,unbelievably Sturgeon nor Salmon can secure a deal on fishing rights from Mrs Mayday. McPeoples vote anyone?
2698 2018-12-17 19:32:29 my intuition (which is often wrong) is that the losses are more heavily related to uncertainty in three arenas than they are the tax policies: information security (breeches, etc), international trade (tariffs), and oil (OPEC production culls).
2699 2018-12-17 19:32:27 The refineries in QC are not part of the provincial government of QC.  Irving Oil does not own the refineries in QC. Federal transfers are not used to buy foreign oil.  That is the point.

2701 2018-12-17 19:32:19 Gary the last #s I read had the US oil supplanting Saudi oil in eastern Canada. They are possibly less than 1% of imports now...if I’m correct.

2703 2018-12-17 19:32:11 Its important when promoting a product or cause to present an acceptable image. Your basically selling it. The Grande Prairie Video appearance simply feeds the Eastern perception of the Western Canadian Oil Industry which far from accurate.
2704 2018-12-17 19:32:10 No one is paying for snake oil in america. They are paying for the natural cost of health care. In socialist countries they don't get a choice of care.

2710 2018-12-17 19:31:22 Did I say that? These people are mad because they are losing jobs due to government decisions. The more oil that is sold means more resource money. Which means more services and more money to equalization. In turn a better country

2724 2018-12-17 19:29:55 Irving Oil is on record saying that Energy East was going to be shipped out for export and that they'd still import oil for their current refinery. None would be used in Canadian consumption. Keep listening to slick talk lying policitians bud!
2725 2018-12-17 19:29:50 #forgotvillas Morneau raged Canada was competitive 6 mos ago; til IMF + OECD disagreed strongly. Says they took action in mini budget in response, not one word on major economic driver oil & gas. #TrueColors Trudeau "immigrants are better thn born Canadians" Canada Day  #cdnpoli
2726 2018-12-17 19:29:46 False prophet....   Liar, fraudster, snake oil salesman.  See you and the rest of your treasonous family behind bars!  The worse example of American values!!
2727 2018-12-17 19:29:40 Wow, taking ALL the jobs and ALL the welfare? That's pretty impressive.

That doesn't happen. Period. Immigrants end up with the shittiest jobs, the ones the oil field boys refuse to take. The oil field boys are on more welfare while waiting for their jobs to come back.

2731 2018-12-17 19:29:32 i gone put tea tree oil on my face and i thought my skin was gin burn off
2732 2018-12-17 19:29:28 Coconut oil will soak up the bacteria and clean it up fast
2733 2018-12-17 19:29:05 Damn oil changes be taking damn near 5 yrs shiddd 
2734 2018-12-17 19:28:46 When will the House vote on it? I use a good quality CBD oil from California. Most other CBD is garbage and too expensive.
2735 2018-12-17 19:28:44 My Dad only ever wanted rice and soya oil. I would buy yams, elubo & whatever else I thought he wanted and he would without fail say, I only want the rice and oil. 

To be able to buy it for him now. 

Sigh.
2736 2018-12-17 19:28:43 I have found the secret to a fulfilling salad is olive oil and cheese, bread, hummus, crisps and a shortbread after #selfcare
2737 2018-12-17 19:28:38 Still looking for oil in Dorset I see
2738 2018-12-17 19:28:13 Yes. And Norway, the UK, Columbia, Kazakhstan, Algeria, Nigeria and the Ivory Coast. Even if energy east had gone through Irving Oil was on the record saying they'd still import for their current refineries as the processing of bitumen and sweet crude aren't compatible.
2739 2018-12-17 19:28:12 Then you are not listening. The oilfield job yo-yo has been a thing since the industry started. It has nothing to do with politics, or immigration. It's purely an oil price thing. And something that we wouldn't have to worry about so much if we invested in other things.
2740 2018-12-17 19:28:10 Our manager in today’s Arab oil money times should be judged on competing for the CL and league, developing players and our style of football. He’s an A on all of those things. CL final, two other finals, regular CL qualification, great players, great football - perfect.
2741 2018-12-17 19:28:02 staaaaahhhp showing me weird shit I don’t wanna see.  One sec I’m watching my friend, next some b is getting oil poured in her eyes and it won’t let me hide it! You suck @Snapchat

2743 2018-12-17 19:27:56 I can understand their anger, it sounds to me like it is about a lot more than "oil jobs", and more about regulation meant to destabilize the oil fields and other employment opportunities. Course I am an objective observer, to our northern neighbors woes.
2744 2018-12-17 19:27:36 Do you add oil to your yam while boiling it too?

Anyone?

No?

2749 2018-12-17 19:27:08 Took a dropper of CBD oil for the first time today. So far it feels like I’m getting a cold?
2750 2018-12-17 19:27:07 With the help of May!  We are being punished by the eu and may. May's  Brexit betrayal will lead to all uk assets stripped similar to Greece.   The SNP want to remain but I it's my belief that our oil will be grabbed by the eu as with all our fishing rights
2751 2018-12-17 19:27:06 I just spent an hour trying to clean peanut oil out of my driveway for the fourth time. We are never, ever, ever frying a turkey again. 
2752 2018-12-17 19:27:04 Not sure why we import any oil at all.... Oh never mind, forgot about all those Liberal votes in Quebec...
2753 2018-12-17 19:27:01 Evan told me if  I go to the dealership and get anything other than an oil change he was gone beat my ass so idk why these crackas tryna trick me into a diagnosis.
2754 2018-12-17 19:26:58 After Zinke leaves the DOI will be run (at least temporarily) by a former oil lobbyist, David Bernhardt? Not surprised: he looks like a 55 gallon drum
2755 2018-12-17 19:26:48 Just taken first “dose” of #CBD oil. I’m trying not to get my hopes up but even if it took the edge of the pain now & again I’d be over the moon. I haven’t lived pain free for 16 years and nor do I expect to again. But if this oil can make it a little easier, I’ll marry it tmrw.
2756 2018-12-17 19:26:44 He won’t because he only has problem with Alberta oil.
2757 2018-12-17 19:26:39 While they’re healing dermablend body makeup/setting powder has worked wonders for me as far as covering them up goes Plus you can get a pretty big bottle for a good price! I don’t have a good solution aside from almond oil and that I think is mostly for the vitamin e

2761 2018-12-17 19:26:26 North sea oil licenses rule be changed for example as it is galling Norway have such a huge sovereign wealth fund £700 B .we should have the same state wealth fund. THE UK State Fund could Of BEEN £500B Or more, we are being held back.
2762 2018-12-17 19:26:25 Anyone who really thinks Gibson should go needs to get back to reality there is no Rich oil magnate waiting to move to Teeside Gibson saves the club and continues to bankroll it. He’s one of the best if not the best chairman around and will continue to be a supporter of the club
2763 2018-12-17 19:26:24 You mean like every country that produces oil?
2764 2018-12-17 19:26:20 So appreciation tweet to @ItsPrincessTia so my whole life I've had peely skin around my noise it's super gross yes i wash my face but it never went away fucking years dawg Tia had me use this oil and cream thing TWICE!!!!! and it's gone the fuck kinda magic do girls got

2767 2018-12-17 19:26:15 can I drench my skin in tea tree oil cause that shit is acting up
2768 2018-12-17 19:26:13 The problem is not that he doesn't use it but that you promote "alternative" medicine. 
The is no such thing as alternative medicine: there is scientifically proven medicine, the rest is snake oil.
2769 2018-12-17 19:26:11 I need some new beard oil, anybody  wanna trick off on me? 

Asking before I finalize a purchase, this is very time sensitive pls 
2770 2018-12-17 19:26:10 The turkish Military arent even oil Guards which would benefit to the turkish People. The TSK is Just Group Working for RTE. At least the US is taking the oil Back to its Country so that the americans have cheap Gas prices.
2771 2018-12-17 19:26:02 By contrast Ontario and Alberta are not in good shape and if we continue to spend freely there is a risk we could be in at least a similar situation to Ontario (Alberta due to oil prices and low taxes).
2772 2018-12-17 19:25:51 Fun trick. Wanna try to justify:

2777 2018-12-17 19:25:30 Nothing more than selling out of our lands to big oil and development of pristine environments.  She is bought and paid for by big oil.  Disgusting!
2778 2018-12-17 19:25:29 couldn't figure out what smelled like oil and meat because i showered last night for sure 

it's my phone.

2782 2018-12-17 19:25:18 ちん……。
2783 2018-12-17 19:25:10 Good God and coconut oil 
2784 2018-12-17 19:25:08 Not necessarily. I never condition my locs. Either set, even when I had bleach. 

If the Shea butter feels too heavy, Jamaican black castor oil is a thick heavy one, then olive, grapeseed, almond & jojoba is the lightest I’ve used.
2785 2018-12-17 19:24:57 If the economy starts to heat from the stimulus and low oil price, than rates will shoot up, which will dampen the stock market and start a recession. Or not. Who really knows?
2786 2018-12-17 19:24:52 No. Play-doh has that tonka bean/vanilla smell, that I think you are referring to?
Plasticine doesn't have that.
It smells mostly of linseed oil.

I'm not a chemist so more than that...
Er, lactones? 
2787 2018-12-17 19:24:51 What is your take on mana bread (rye) no salt yeast or oil ? Very high n fiber
2788 2018-12-17 19:24:36 I need to start working on cars. 20 bucks to ROTATE tires. 80+ bucks for an oil change. Yo that crazy to me
2789 2018-12-17 19:24:35 I just ran out of my lavender essential oil. What am I supposed to do now 
2790 2018-12-17 19:24:26 いい感じに酔ってきたゾォ
2791 2018-12-17 19:24:19 I was using some lip balm to loosen up a zipper, and the cats were immediately curious. 

Then when I learned peppermint oil is toxic to cats, washed the zipper, and threw away the lip balm. It probably wasn't enough to have mattered, but I didn't want to risk it! 
2792 2018-12-17 19:24:17 Coconut oil and lots of warm water but honestly it ripped off all of my lashes with them. I’d probably prefer to have had them removed professionally but my eyes couldn’t handle one more chemical on them
2793 2018-12-17 19:24:07 We both got tough fixtures. City with their oil money tho 
2794 2018-12-17 19:23:54 Free oil change son! Ill take it
2795 2018-12-17 19:23:48 But  buy Saudi oil while Alberta suffers.
2796 2018-12-17 19:23:43 Any Palmer’s products and use coconut oil (if your body doesn’t have a reaction or anything to it) on top to seal the moisture in. I also used self tan to kinda camouflage mine. You can barely see mine now. Give it time beautiful 
2797 2018-12-17 19:23:43 Happy birthday                    Presidio u go live long on earth  more oil for ur head more credit alert more God favor on u

2799 2018-12-17 19:23:32 TMX was in the home stretch & Northern gateway was to the point construction would begin. Then Trudeau pushed thru C48 west coast tanker ban. Which seems to only apply to Canadian tankers with Alberta oil. hmmm. So do the math.
2800 2018-12-17 19:23:30 I never measure. But I mix brown sugar peppermint oil a little water till its course. Rub it on my lips. Wash it off then follow up with some lip chap.
2801 2018-12-17 19:23:28 Sure, okay. I guess oil isn't a pollutant either.
2802 2018-12-17 19:23:03 I wrote up an article on Rex Tillerson and the connnections to big oil in Russia but I can't find it. You're welcome for the tease. I'll try to find it.
2803 2018-12-17 19:23:03 Let me get this straight. You vowed to shut down the oil industry. You shut down the coal industry. And you think we're going to trust you now? You have never once fought for albertans and their jobs and there is no way you ever would.

2805 2018-12-17 19:23:00 Where would Irving go to replace their feedstock?  I have an idea, but .....

East coast refineries are configured to process light/medium crude and MB/SK/AB have a limited supply. But Irving could switch from Saudi to NFLD oil - a Cdn product!
2806 2018-12-17 19:23:00 I wanted to open the dump valves on oil tankers and smother all those French beaches I'd never see.

2812 2018-12-17 19:22:16 Solar has already become cost competitive. Are you factoring in the externalities of oil use, production and transport? Ie; when there's a solar spill it's called a nice day. The real 'cost' of oil is frighteningly undetermined.

2825 2018-12-17 19:20:53 WTI crude oil bout to bust thru $50 support.  Watch out below.  Stocks should follow.

2830 2018-12-17 19:20:40 How much do the oil companies make? How much will the liabilities cost us when they leave legally thanks to Redwater decision and BIA? Who will pay for the remediation of the moonscape in AB? Our kids. So lets be clear. We are getting peanuts compared to big oil buddy.

2832 2018-12-17 19:20:33 That's what happens when the Industry staggers technological release to maximize their own profit drive...see "Big Oil" and the electric car to understand how "Big Tech" handled processor development...
2833 2018-12-17 19:20:33 What's a non-work related item you have to have on your desk at all times? Mine is a bottle of olive oil.
2834 2018-12-17 19:20:30 50% of Quebec oil purchases are Canadian. 40% are from US.

are you saying Canada should close its border to imports?
2835 2018-12-17 19:20:13 Facts are king and the facts are the US can basically force companies and countries to buy oil in dollars.
What will happen in the near term vis a vis gold is only speculation.
2836 2018-12-17 19:20:10 Probably just simmer it in coconut oil to remove all the dangerous psychoactive properties then just throw the weed away. No need to waste the oil though. Probably still good for cooking.
2837 2018-12-17 19:19:51 soooo happy im finally getting a oil change and shit for my car tm 
2838 2018-12-17 19:19:32 One of my E&Ps is 1 and 1 down. I'm not in oil directly. I'm hoping the market is at the bottom today. Sure feels like it. Technically I think this could really be the bottom.
2839 2018-12-17 19:19:18 むー。
2840 2018-12-17 19:19:00 I believe the number one platform issue has to be #climatechange, because everything that matters flows from that...ie, healthy economy and healthy Canadians with a future. The tricky part will be how to not alienate oil producing provinces.

2851 2018-12-17 19:17:34 I forgot to buy more vegetable oil. 
2852 2018-12-17 19:17:20 Havent seen anything helpful written on MJ withdrawal comparing wax/oil/flower but I expect wax/oil worse. So far no good treatments established for MJ withdrawal vs alcohol or opioids. Some meds may decrease insomnia anxiety edginess-all off label. Best to see an addiction doc
2853 2018-12-17 19:17:15 Just because something is vegan or keto doesn’t mean it’s vegan/keto food. Anything low carb is keto but no one goes around calling lettuce keto food. It’s just food. Now a coconut oil fat bomb is something you’d describe as keto food because normal people wouldn’t eat it.
2854 2018-12-17 19:17:14 That's right. We're not clever enough to leave a union that squandered our oil, creams off our taxes and impoverishes our children and disabled. Sorry, the days of the union are numbered #DisolveTheUnion. UK is an international laughing stock of it's own making, sad to see.
2855 2018-12-17 19:17:10 ん？
2856 2018-12-17 19:17:09 Check your facts.  I'm not a fan of how they are treating the West but they don't buy Saudi oil.  Brad knows this and should be honest.  #MerryChristmas #HappyHolidays
2857 2018-12-17 19:17:09 Most of @lisamurkowski funding, over $800,000, comes from oil and gas industry.  Her arctic project is bad news for our planet. @sunrisemvmt @Ocasio2018 take note...this is a black old deal, not a #GreenNewDeal
2858 2018-12-17 19:16:53 I honestly would of did the damn oil change myself if I had the time & a drip pan to use
2859 2018-12-17 19:16:42 Tomi and Candyce in an oil cage match?

That I would watch

Get Rogan to do the play by play
2860 2018-12-17 19:16:40 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
2861 2018-12-17 19:16:34 me: h- 

dudes who post just pictures of their car on ig: good to have this beauty backjust got an oil change can’t wait to get her back on the road
2862 2018-12-17 19:16:22 The power generated kilogram of fissionable material equals 22,000 barrels of crude oil. But by all means, let's annex Brazil and turn it into a wind farm for Dog Felcher Falls.
2863 2018-12-17 19:16:21 How is Alberta/Sask. oil shipped then? Empty Milk tankers?
2864 2018-12-17 19:16:07 I just touched some lavender in a customer's driveway and the smell reminded me of that time you bathed yourself in lavender oil..

One of my favorite memories of you
2865 2018-12-17 19:15:53 met de l’huile pour les éviter pour après!! style Bi oil ou truc comme ça 
2866 2018-12-17 19:15:52 I reconcile it by taking same attitude that oil companies themselves (& Sun Tzu) have taken & that’s to work with your detractors. Berman was appointed at the request of the OSAG who had been working with her since long before the NDP took power... another Kenney lie by omission
2867 2018-12-17 19:15:45 Immigrants are not the problem. Oil is. Alberta goes through this all of the time. Prices go down, people lose jobs. Prices go back up, people get jobs. This is why Alberta needs to focus on RENEWABLE energy.

Again, it's NOT a problem related to immigration. Period.
2868 2018-12-17 19:15:37 Came in for an oil change and then they threw all these other services my car needs at me soo i told them my daddy pays for everything so I’d have to let him know lmao ugh leave me alone I’m poor 
2869 2018-12-17 19:15:28 @BrendanSchaub Brendan what is the brand of CBD oil you use for your son? You never mentioned what the “world’s best CBD oil” is??
2870 2018-12-17 19:15:27 The Chinese stock market in 2015 fell about from the peak 50% before recovering, the Oil bubble in 2008 fell 70% before recovering. You can always cherry pick data to prove any magic number

I hope you're right and the price will recover, but it wont be because of a magic number
2871 2018-12-17 19:15:23 I need a oil change 
2872 2018-12-17 19:15:21 Me that just prepared this rice with red oil, onion, bala fish, pepper, salt , seasoning cube. 

Am actually going to flush it down with Coke
2873 2018-12-17 19:15:19 Its actually a great plan.  has the best environmental record out of all major oil producing countries. It also has the best social benifits. It benifits all canadians and not dictators. The world energy needs is increasing dramatically.  Canadian O&G should fill that need
2874 2018-12-17 19:15:13 Lol no more free dollars fr them and houses at maitama

2880 2018-12-17 19:14:38 My understanding is that Quebec now gets 80 percent of their oil from Canada and the US. The Saudi oil imports stopped years ago.
2881 2018-12-17 19:14:35 WE????  Do you mean Irving oil? A private company.
2882 2018-12-17 19:14:34 Any doctor that tells you they know what the outcomes will be for hormone treatments in support of gender re-assignment is selling you snake oil. Puberty blockers are this century's leeching.

2886 2018-12-17 19:14:12 I use Cerave moisturizing cream then top with an oil or shea butter to seal it. When i drink enough water/ eat right, I only need one "coat" but if not, it takes 2 coats lol i was given hydrocortisone as a teen but that shits difficult lmfaooo cerave works perfectly

2892 2018-12-17 19:13:38 Man the oil is a hit!! But I have to have the tea at all times. It's like a warm hug
2893 2018-12-17 19:13:33 To be fair across the board, there was an oil boom under Obama, the boom also all but crashed under him too. Trump's drilling regulations has created a boom of sorts. I say of sorts as it's been a more steady, stable growth than "find, deplete, leave".
2894 2018-12-17 19:13:28 If they're the fools, then why is Alberta the one sitting in a puddle of oil.  Why not refine it, create real permanent jobs and maybe not sell out our natural resources.  You should be angry with the oil companies not the government, unless it's a handout you are looking for.
2895 2018-12-17 19:13:25 It's probably keratosis pilaris! I have it too, its hella common :) I find that regular exfoliation and following w oil (I use avocado oil) helps a lot.

2898 2018-12-17 19:13:07 Is it at all possible that the "OIL" which man is taking from the ground  helps the earth remain "stable" - or is there no truth to that?
2899 2018-12-17 19:13:01 Trump has lost this die hard conservative republican because of his oil policy.  I have to believe Republican Texans are even more pissed off than me.  Trump will lose Texas come 2020 and possibly a few of the other oil states as well.

2906 2018-12-17 19:12:41 So realistically how would the average American deal with the huge differences in fuel prices as we move away from oil? I'd love to hear thoughts on that and improving public transport.

2928 2018-12-17 19:10:58 We only here speak of solar, wind, and no pipelines. Your little gang of greens are pumping the propaganda about the end of this planet. We require oil to run this planet. And you are a bit out to lunch when you say everything will good without oil.

These assholes are just pissy that they're losing their oilfield jobs (like they do every few years in Alberta) and want to blame it on immigrants. Oil is a NON-RENEWABLE RESOURCE.
2953 2018-12-17 19:09:03 Yes it is time for action. We need immediate action to reduce the CO2 emissions that is causing the destructive climate change we all see happening right now. Let’s vote out politicians working for Big Oil and against The People. Why should they profit while we pay the price?

2969 2018-12-17 19:07:21 I use raw coconut oil (like the kind you can get in a bigass jar at the grocery store). After a shower, I use that 1st all over (since it’s high absorbency). After a few minutes, I use cocoa butter. I use that only on my face, though. (I have oily skin so that works well for me.)

2981 2018-12-17 19:06:18 Alberta would feel the extreme oil price swings even more than now. Things would be even better when prices are high, and worse when they're low. And if oil prices settle at the lower end (increasing US shale combined with plateauing demand), they won't have help.

2986 2018-12-17 19:05:37 One nuance with olive oil is that a lot of it out there is adulterated with soybean or canola oil with zero indication of it on the label.  Heating (or even consuming) it then becomes a problem.

2988 2018-12-17 19:05:22 @elonmusk Ever considered drilling an oil well and starting a refinery, on a small scale, for the sole purpose of documenting and making public the Analytics behind the actual outputs of Pollutants and the overall (In)efficiency of gasoline? Thinking out loud on this, to clarify.
2989 2018-12-17 19:05:21 Well, that's what happens when you have a coal guy heading EPA and and oil guy heading DOI. These are exactly the type of men you don't want in power. #environment
2990 2018-12-17 19:05:19 can be used to enflame emotion & overcome logic & reason. Ever met an MLM salesman peddling their snake oil as the miracle cure despite all facts/reality that contradict it?
2991 2018-12-17 19:05:13 It gets some nice chain lubricating oil of course. And the cabin crew will help it secure it's restraints and even provide extenders if required
2992 2018-12-17 19:05:12 I'm allowing for butter or coconut oil, for example. But only to cook in, not to accompany.
2993 2018-12-17 19:05:09 spx going to hell and crude oil futures positive divergence to spx
2994 2018-12-17 19:05:03 Minister says $180 million has been “captured” from the oil companies to fix the $1billion Ogoni cleanup project.

$1billion was withdrawn from Excess CRUDE account populated by Ogoni oil to fix the war in the Lake Chad axis!

Shouldn’t the cash in the crude acct be used instead!

2998 2018-12-17 19:04:37 It doesn't matter whether you believe or not, the truth is always the truth irrespective of how it sounds. Period!!!
2999 2018-12-17 19:04:28 Energy East was to deliver diluted bitumen(oil sands oil), not sweet crude which could have been used by refineries in the East. Its a single pipeline not a bunch of little ones that have different grades of crude.

3001 2018-12-17 19:04:10 Great day for op-ed from big oil bootlickers claiming Alberta holds all the cards of it comes to separation. Getting tired of the petulance and outright nonsense.
3002 2018-12-17 19:04:09  This air is truly demonic, so I’ve found that keeping my moisturizing simple & frequent has been most effective.

I don’t use any particular face products—what i use on the rest of my body, I use on my face as well. Coconut oil & really thick cocoa butter work wonders for me…
3003 2018-12-17 19:04:05 Man! Like bitch give my conventional oil my shit don’t need that expensive ass shit
3004 2018-12-17 19:04:03 Prime Minister does not run these companies....complain to the companies that buy the oil
3005 2018-12-17 19:04:01 Ngl I don't know how people use coconut oil to moisturise their skin cos it literally does nothing for my skin, but lay on top.
3006 2018-12-17 19:03:46 あたしいい事思いつきました
3007 2018-12-17 19:03:43 Ok, let me rephrase it so you you can understand.  Where in Canada does that crude oil come from?
3008 2018-12-17 19:03:36 Get this oil change now or next week
3009 2018-12-17 19:03:26 
You didn't know that?
Anyway I wouldn't smoke it either, not too interested in the oil either. 
Maybe the #hemp milk.

I think #MS is messing with my throat. #NoBueno
3010 2018-12-17 19:03:25 That’s the wait for an oil change 
3011 2018-12-17 19:03:18 Honestly, pitch dark at 4:31pm has put me in a perpetual foul mood. Not sure if all the fish oil in the world will help.
3012 2018-12-17 19:03:07 Red scare, neo-McCarthyism. Trump/Brexit is a failure of politics that has seen our taxes spent on bailouts, warfare, regime change and oil, gas and weapons manufacturers subsidies while the people are financially ruined. Easier to blame Russia then derail the gravy train
3013 2018-12-17 19:03:03 Redwater Energy Corporation is a bankrupt company that held licences in oil and gas properties. Those properties included orphan wells that are at the end of their lives and are non-producing. The cost of remediation for disclaimed wells can exceed their value. -Big bill here.
3014 2018-12-17 19:03:03 If he wasnt a megalomaniac nutcase trying to suppress all Sudanese under his direct control, south Sudan wouldn't be a seperate country and the price of the Sudanese pound wouldn't be 20x's less than it was before split when the oil deposits of south were reflected in the price
3015 2018-12-17 19:03:01 We all heavily subsidize automobiles whether we use them or not (infrastructure, parking requirements, oil/gas subsidies, safety oversight, public health, etc.) with seemingly little pushback and yet we always struggle politically to do anything for public transit.
3016 2018-12-17 19:02:56 Melt some crayons. Shave your head. Eat half a jar of coconut oil. Cry in your coffee.

3020 2018-12-17 19:02:43 And the Iranians want to put a choke hold on the shipping lines for the world's yes the world's oil supply lines so Iran would control the world's energy supply And if you don't  think that is a problem think again. Look how Iran has reacted in various situations so far.
3021 2018-12-17 19:02:37 It's not "almost a plan to destabilize solatr power." SRM is WHOLLY funded by Big Oil. @DKeithclimate's partner is Canada's biggest tar sands oil magnate.  It IS a plan to destabilize solar. We get a dim, dark, dirty planet dependent on their tech, not lovely sun and free power.
3022 2018-12-17 19:02:33 Interesting to see also year to date returns: natural gas the winner, a fossil fuel with at least less harmful pollutant emissions than oil and other fossil fuels; but harmful anyways.

3028 2018-12-17 19:01:55 A "piece" refers to an art project, finished or unfinished. So I'll be in my trailer w/ a stretched canvas on an easel, elbow deep in linseed oil, & someone will get too close and I'll say "I don't need your fancy [contextualization] up in this piece, [Cretan].

3035 2018-12-17 19:01:07 Plus not all oil to be sent in pipelines was oil sands(not tar sands) oil... with tar sands comment proves your anti oil activist affiliation
3036 2018-12-17 19:01:06 That oil was to be tanked out of the country, wouldn't have refined for Canadian consumption so thanks for playing.
3037 2018-12-17 19:00:48 Obama used the Dept of energy (which was created to promote energy US independence) to stop fracking! Fracking technology is main reason for increased US oil production. Obama lies!

3052 2018-12-17 18:59:22 My daughter and hubby have bad eczema and lotion doesn't work. Even prescription lotions don't work. Baby oil keeps it from getting too bad though, so that's cheap to try. Works better than coconut or olive oil too.
3053 2018-12-17 18:59:13 Look at telephony operators. Look at wireless companies. Look say smartphone brands. Look at electronics manufacturers. Look at oil production. Look at energy production. Look at media companies. EU.

Look at all the unrest in this world. Consolidation, collusion. Open your eyes.
3054 2018-12-17 18:59:13 Are you really asking that question..TRUDEAU stopped energy east. 
Thus preventing refineries from getting the oil
3055 2018-12-17 18:59:11 I know it’s necessary but honestly waiting for your car to get an oil change is THE most inconvenient task.
3056 2018-12-17 18:59:04 I used to have bad eczema when I was young and scratched like crazy until raw too. Vitamin E oil on them helped heal really fast. We’d lather it on and cover it up. It’s really itchy during cold weather so just keep his skin extra hydrated with coconut and Vit E..
3057 2018-12-17 18:58:48 Cbd oil from apexx website will stop that

3064 2018-12-17 18:58:16 My entire skeleton is hurting. Sometimes aching. When I had oil one time, I took far too much but the pains went away! It was THC only. I hear CBD is anti-inflammatory but I can't see it ending this degree of pain? I could not stand up or get out of bed.

3071 2018-12-17 18:57:46 All of the information regarding the benefits of each oil, is described for you in handbooks. I'm also trained in essential oils outside of YL and provide support along the way.    crochet toys for diffusers sounds intersting and fun.

why bother lying?
3085 2018-12-17 18:56:24 That would not be a problem if they accepted oil from Alberta.  Just to help you a little bit, the tar sands are located in Los Angeles, CA, and they don’t ship that to Canada.

3094 2018-12-17 18:55:38 Leaders are speaking seriously about taking action that will ruin the oil industry.

It's no on the surface but that's what's implicit in a lot of the GND talk.

3106 2018-12-17 18:54:26 Refineries out East aren't set up to handle tar sands oil. Would you recommend a ridiculously large cash payer funded to entice the private companies to retrofit?  Or would you rather they just be shut down, worker's unemployed, and Eastern economies dumped into the toilet?
3107 2018-12-17 18:54:21 The maintenance...it aint just gas that makes it go...its fuel so u can get where u going...but if u dont make sure its enough engine coolant in there or you not gettin oil changes and the occasional tune up....u gon be in a hole lol

Na globalnem odru se nafta ceni zaradi tržnih razlogov - in sicer zaradi Frackinga v USA. The world is awash in crude oil, so the price keeps falling. Don't you ever forget that. ;)
3118 2018-12-17 18:53:24 I don't like the guy either, but it ain't Trudeau trying to fuck ya. It's the oil companies, and y'all got stockholm syndrome fighting their fight for them.
3119 2018-12-17 18:53:24 I'm conflicted on whether they need breaking up. People are choosing to use them in a way they weren't with traditional monopolies. Should a remedy to Facebook's user-based network effect be the same as Standard Oil and Northern Securities Co.'s product/distribution dominance?
3120 2018-12-17 18:53:18 Want to diminish stretch marks? Use Vitamin E oil and Cocoa butter. You can find both at your local drug store.
3121 2018-12-17 18:53:18 My Cannabis Doctor is a rheumatologist, worked out great for me because I also have arthritis, since my 20s.  CBD and THC.  When I first started making my canna oil and canna butter, I noticed right away that it was helping the pain in my hands from ringing out the cheesecloth
3122 2018-12-17 18:53:15 With all that money from Canada to Quebec I don’t see CAQ doing a shit with oil and gas first year. They moving safe first year.
3123 2018-12-17 18:53:07 The Quebec premier finds Saudi oil socially acceptable

3125 2018-12-17 18:52:14 My room really smells like baby oil this is like the 3rd time
3126 2018-12-17 18:52:06 I just put oil in my car, and put air in my tires and didn’t even freak out ab my hands getting dirty this time (yes my pet peeve is having black shit all over my hands) so now I’m opening my own mechanical shop stay tuned
3127 2018-12-17 18:52:06 Leave it to religion to screw things up. Hopefully Utah doesn't become the state of oil, gas, and radioactivity. Not exactly a theme park I would want to go to.
3128 2018-12-17 18:52:01  oil is beter

Mijn eerste keer; 'uuh ooh ja is goed'.. liet een zelfs een scheet, gênant!!

Maar daarna..wow; these girls have knowledge!
3129 2018-12-17 18:52:00 Never Enjoyed It Raw, But Love It Sautéed In Garlic & Olive Oil.
3130 2018-12-17 18:51:54 When the BP oil rig’s connection with the surface of the Gulf of Mexico failed, the rig sank after burning for 36 hours, but a 240 FOOT oil geyser was shot into the air for 87 DAYS afterwards, releasing 210 MILLION gallons of oil and creating 625 miles of oil slick 
3131 2018-12-17 18:51:51 Fossil fuels don't come from dinosaurs nor have they ever.

It's a simple natural event and will continue throughout time.  Underground gas and oil fields will continue to refill as we're currently seeing.

Impossible for man made climate change to occur because of this.
3132 2018-12-17 18:51:50 You need to skip the palm oil Ted. That stuff is literally killing our planet. Not to mention #orangutans & their habitats. Please stop funding any Palm oil. Legal & illegal Palm oil trade is devastating to the planet. Look it up. #PalmOil #climatechange
3133 2018-12-17 18:51:46 me, baby talking to my dog, who has decided my moms bathrobe on the bathroom floor is a great place to hang out today: ooh, im just an olfactory banquet, huh? i smell like sweat and motor oil and now lemons!
3134 2018-12-17 18:51:43 Are you suggesting the government tell a private company who they should and shouldn’t buy product from? Or are you purposely ignoring the fact a private company buys that oil to drum up anger? I feel it’s the latter. Be better Brad.

3137 2018-12-17 18:51:10 @oil_shaeikh, i can’t believe all these comments are coming from you. Two wrongs can never make even half-right. 

It doesn’t matter whether he is a governor’s son or otherwise. What she did is wrong, and his is worse. Period!
3138 2018-12-17 18:51:10 What essential oil scents are good for when you want to go to sleep?
3139 2018-12-17 18:51:08 Also sit up rather than laying flat. If you have a humidifier turn that on. If not, let some water boil on the stove so the steam adds humidity to the air. Take a bath with Eucalyptus oil (or add this or Vicks to the boiling water). Hope you feel better soon!

3141 2018-12-17 18:51:04 Well if you mean the US oil they import can't disagree with you there. Thought you were a person of intelligence & integrity, not a neo-liberal populist shill.
3142 2018-12-17 18:51:03 Buy a Chevy you’ll be driving it forever just change the oil and you’ll see magic
3143 2018-12-17 18:50:47 I bet it will be based on $50 oil.....not likely

3147 2018-12-17 18:50:19 Exactly, lol, can't even bother to find someone who can count. Has it ever occurred to Alberta to stop giving away our natural resources and actually refine it (creating more jobs) but I guess the gas and oil industry would actually have to invest instead of pointing their finger
3148 2018-12-17 18:50:14 Do not put butter or oil on the burns as it may trap heat &amp; cause burns to worsen. Instead hold the burnt area under cold running water.
3149 2018-12-17 18:50:11 M private companies have to buy foreign oil when the government prevents you from buying Canadian oil
3150 2018-12-17 18:50:09 I greased my scalp lastnight.... where did the grease go? I told y’all my hair drinks up oil.
3151 2018-12-17 18:50:01 Why on Alberta electricity bills is coal power priced based on oil prices, and not GAS PRICES?
3152 2018-12-17 18:50:00 Hi, Gigi. Pine oil supplies are limited and had become more expensive, which was a major factor in the change and will continue to be an issue around producing original pine scent Pine-Sol. (1/2)
3153 2018-12-17 18:49:57 ok..well keep smiling and tweet away to keep yourself busy.

3154 2018-12-17 18:49:48 There is a lot to this story...it involves oil & gas, uranium and the Mormon Church's mind set about its State.

3161 2018-12-17 18:48:44 Definitely. Especially with trump being so pro Israel. I read somewhere that Texas also either stopped or made it difficult for Austin TX to get rid of plastic bags in shops because of oil connections 
3162 2018-12-17 18:48:42 I have more stuff but this is what i regularly use. Also: olive oil. But we all know that one already
3163 2018-12-17 18:48:20 as McConnell and Grassly have said Elections have consequences. There is no difference to your butterfly's and Polar bears, and sonic testing and dolphins ,Offshore Oil, and the wetlands. Give them an inch and they will take 10000s of Miles.

3167 2018-12-17 18:47:20 Soybean oil is actually a good source of healthy fats, including omega-3 fatty acids and polyunsaturated fats. Just like many other foods, moderation is key. So, when eaten in moderation and in place of other unhealthy fats, soybean oil can be a healthy addition to your diet.
3168 2018-12-17 18:47:09 Nah bro every dish looked amazing . It looks like those commercial foods with cardboard and motor oil.
3169 2018-12-17 18:47:07 90% or more of all facts about Tesla's present and future health were positive during the last several months.  Has most the media, or some of its reporters, including CNBC, the NYT, Business Insider, etc, become mercenaries of the oil companies to the detriment of our children?

3172 2018-12-17 18:46:55 Ought to be seen in hist contexts:

Anc'nt Sunni-Shi'a split, now fought out KSA v Iran, in which W best not take sides;

Iran's ancient status (x 2300y)
v modern W need of oil (->KSA's excessive dom'n);

US/UK inv't in '53 coup, w/ pro-W Iran ->wrongly anti-US:

Needs balance
3173 2018-12-17 18:46:39 2) a toner would be a very good idea it helps balance your skin’s pH level

3174 2018-12-17 18:46:37 That thread was beautiful for the most part.  But some of them women looked every bit of 40 plus. U couldn’t put a little jojoba oil on or some lip gloss.

3180 2018-12-17 18:45:57 Hope Im not too late.. but I was wondering do you make any CBD tinctures for dogs? I give my dog with a knee issue CBD treats but want to try oil for her. I would guess I could use the tinctures you already sell but not sure how strong they are compared to the ones made for pets
3181 2018-12-17 18:45:55 I go to Jamaica to get the castor oil my hair u part it n blink the part gone 
3182 2018-12-17 18:45:47 Hi, I know Rosemount well. Fina oil is now a subsidiary of Total who have had a large presence in A redeem for many years. It’s not a bad place, Aberdeen, although I’m a bit biased, but the council has lost its way and it should have developed the city’s attractions more.

3190 2018-12-17 18:44:53 Yippeeeeeeeeeee. Because of Pres Trump, U.S. is now largest oil producer in the world, surpassing Russia & Saudi Arabia. (WSJ). Obama did everything he could to prevent this & 43 was a doofus.
3191 2018-12-17 18:44:51 Because you've ate oil rice with nothing
3192 2018-12-17 18:44:47 USA has no oil?

USA should apologize to Germany. 
Yemen.  
Germany complained...fuck saudi with no moral.

3195 2018-12-17 18:44:40 CBD oil is a rip off
3196 2018-12-17 18:44:25 Republicans have nothing left but lies.  Wall St and Big Oil won't allow them to offer voters anything else.
3197 2018-12-17 18:44:23 Because refineries aren't running at near full capacity. And a pipeline to them would help them out, end our dependence on foreign oil, and be able to get to the world market to get market prices... It would also cut our emissions by 6.7%.

3201 2018-12-17 18:44:07 Yup, that’s one reason I’m not fond of Bernie.

Got anything other than whataboutism to defend Beto being a puppet for oil companies?
3202 2018-12-17 18:44:06 Of course they do, but it's based on their profits, not on their contribution to #climatecosts. Solar firms pay the same taxes as oil companies. Also, we're trying to go after global companies, which don't pay taxes in Canada.
3203 2018-12-17 18:43:54 … improved a lot since my nightmare night last week, though it does make life a bit dull. I don’t drink coffee anyway, but if I did, that’d be in the bin. For me the main trigger seems to be oil and fat, and wines and spirits. Bah humbug.
3204 2018-12-17 18:43:52 That is our conventional oil change price - full synthetic is usually more than $30 but coupons have brought it down in the past - be on the lookout!

3210 2018-12-17 18:43:34 These oil spills never cease, are we in a race to kill even the oceans?
3211 2018-12-17 18:43:25 When your 31 but still have to come to daddy when a light comes on your car...apparently they need oil! Give them tyres a kick while your there an lock it an walk round checking the doors are locked like every dad! Nice1 pops 
3212 2018-12-17 18:43:24 None of the country have courage to stop selling oil to India . India is one of the super power. India is not a beggar country like pakistan .

3215 2018-12-17 18:43:03 The economy will not recover simply by pretending to return slave-labour jobs from overseas. The wealth of a nation lies underground. There are vast mineral & oil resources in Alaska & no-one should privately own whats underground. That belongs to the nation #qanon
3216 2018-12-17 18:43:00 Another volatile day of trading drags US #Stocks back into the red as oil prices fall 2% on supply concerns

3217 2018-12-17 18:42:53 even john cena and wwe staffs are afraid to go there...but trump loves oil so... most hypocrite organisation, wont say a word about chinese muslims treatments, yemen etc but poking nose on indian affairs, where porkistan is sponsoriing terrorist acts

3219 2018-12-17 18:42:29 my specialty. peppermint oil, lemon, ginger, baking soda, BRAT (bananas rice apples toast) diet, and pepto are my go tos depending on what i have on hand
3220 2018-12-17 18:42:23 1. No kidding, they have no choice but to buy foreign oil without pipelines to eastern Canada so they could buy only Canadian oil and not send billions overseas to dictators and despots - that’s the point
2. Do you get it? Point is there should be zero foreign imports
3221 2018-12-17 18:42:12 This is a a guy who used to promote snake oil linking cancer to cures to the Bible verse *for Cash) touting diabetes cures that no medical agency or group supported ones he himself had not used
3222 2018-12-17 18:42:08 Was in Shoprite buying food and all and I found 2.5liters cooking oil at k48.99. I just told myself People that eat food without cooking oil don't die I'll survive!!! I'll survive!!
3223 2018-12-17 18:41:55 Don’t people change their own oil? Sounds gross glad I don’t do that
3224 2018-12-17 18:41:51 I smell like coffee and fryer oil 
3225 2018-12-17 18:41:46 #UKOG Now the swampies are saying tankers don't count.

Certain people are loosing their senses . 

Let me assure you that unless you have a pipeline of course. The sign of success is oil tankers running out of the front gates. No tankers no oil company.

Simples.

3229 2018-12-17 18:41:32 Me telling other people about self-care and not letting grades define u is like oil companies joining the climate change and sustainability discourse

But maybe I’ll just book another flight after I see him in March. Or buy him one? Haha he’s already gonna visit me tho
3236 2018-12-17 18:40:52 @LBC oh look, it's the 'unelected elite' official, never elected to be in the UK parliament, still on the payroll of Brussels, happen to be a journalist, throwing oil on the fire in the debate again
3237 2018-12-17 18:40:51 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
3238 2018-12-17 18:40:51 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
3239 2018-12-17 18:40:31 It is but won't be achieved by giving 90% exemptions to coal emitting plants. Also places like BC being the number 1 exporter of coal in North America won't help either or increasing oil production like Trudeau is doing. Under him, our emissions have risen
3240 2018-12-17 18:40:19 @JustinTrudeau    If Quebec has no appetite for a pipeline, WHY do they have have an appetite for oil based equalization payment?   Is this the typical Quebec acting like a spoiled teenager?
3241 2018-12-17 18:40:19 I’ve been sitting at the Tuscaloosa Chevy service center for almost 3 hours. I just need an oil change
3242 2018-12-17 18:40:18 Jesus lady,  families are struggling.  My family.  I was laid off 2 weeks ago.  My wife’s last day might be December 31st.  Companies are closing,  small towns are dying.  Small towns that support all of Canada via oil.

I am done with this conversation.
3243 2018-12-17 18:40:05 え、君顎あるの？顎ってやっぱりどこかで買うの？僕顎持ってないんだけど。
3244 2018-12-17 18:40:04 it’s crazy!! i have a volkswagen and they’re expensive anyways like my car is literally a 2007 it shouldn’t b that expensive for an oil change. and then i know ppl that have like 2018s and there’s are like $35 lmaooo really just depends on your car i guess....
3245 2018-12-17 18:40:01 It’s bizarre. Shouldn’t they be celebrating Trudeau’s wholesale failure on climate? He adopted Harper’s carbon reduction targets, completely failed to meet them, and handed billions to big oil. What more do they want??? #cdnpoli

3247 2018-12-17 18:39:57 Once again, speed limits only apply to mechanically-propelled vehicles.
The Law defines that as a vehicle powered by petrol/oil/gas/steam/electricity.
There are NO minimum speed requirements for cycles.
Stop telling fibs.
3248 2018-12-17 18:39:56 I'm sure the people who built the Big O are long since retired... Plus, oil companies build pipelines.
3249 2018-12-17 18:39:51 smart cats know that when The Donald tries to formulate a clear sentence, his staff whispers #covfefe
3250 2018-12-17 18:39:42 "Debate is the oil with which democratic yam must be eaten..." Which one is "democratic yam" again?
3251 2018-12-17 18:39:35 Sorry to to hear!! Definitely recommend trying cbd oil for dogs, it's really effective for seizures in dogs!! Best of health!! 
3252 2018-12-17 18:39:34 Tum logon ka masla yeh haj tum logon ko apnay ilawa sab bewaqoof nazar aatay hain. Tum yeh kehna chah rahi ho k tum oil & gas drilling expert ho aur aisa bilkul nai hota. Safma pe dehaan do yeh tumharay level se ooper ki cheez hai.
3253 2018-12-17 18:39:31 Well according to the former head of Shell oil it had nothing to do with Odumbo. .
3254 2018-12-17 18:39:26 You’re the last person i expect this from. Can you @oil_shaeikh call a Muslimah a daughter of a prostitute and Dakikiya no matter the situation at hand?

I can’t believe you said she deserves whatever she got. I’m not saying she is right. But, he surely lacks home training too.
3255 2018-12-17 18:39:22 Samplings in NS yesterday, a table of 10 varieties: "All local, no added oils, no added olive oil so it's healthier..." Did not taste.
3256 2018-12-17 18:39:20 ouch
cocout oil should help? idk?
3257 2018-12-17 18:39:11 I love the duck spring rolls, they are even more delicious then the ones from the Chinese takeaway and they are palm oil free which is a huge bonus! :) #NoPalmOilChristmas
3258 2018-12-17 18:39:05 Yes they should have a seat at the table but so should the people of this state, this country and this planet. At this critical moment in our planets health we all have the right to comment on the impact of more fossil fuel development. Why should Big Oil profit while we pay?

3260 2018-12-17 18:38:40 I had a breakfast birthday date mimosa, two beers with my salad at my birthday lunch date, and I’m currently getting my oil changed and tires rotated. 27 is a weird place y’all.

3262 2018-12-17 18:38:30 The oil companies believe that CO2 drives it and that the increase in CO2 is caused by humans.
3263 2018-12-17 18:38:26 No BUT we'd save you  on that oil change!!
3264 2018-12-17 18:38:20 Sure!. The continuous GENOCIDE of Hebrew Biafra by British govt and their jihadists to steal oil and gas can not be considered a human sacrifice based Foriegn Policy. Go figure Globalist reasoning.1=a million, 3.5million+ killed in GENOCIDE for oil and gas=0.
3265 2018-12-17 18:38:11 Horsewest strikes again although have to agree with them here it’s a stinking share which has no hope of commercial oil
3266 2018-12-17 18:38:09 Flat tire and need an oil change yay
3267 2018-12-17 18:38:07 Not for long if oil keeps 
3268 2018-12-17 18:38:03 Coat your meat pieces in flour, Brown it in a dash of olive oil...add onions, potoes, carrots & whatever else you want. Add beef stock/Oxo and few drops of worchester sauce or guiness/beer or ale or all and simmer slow cook so beef tender. Hope you like my threw together stew 
3269 2018-12-17 18:37:56 Sweetie
Eat a lot of vegetables and fruits 
Use shea butter or coconut oil 
Honey helps to for cool toning.
3270 2018-12-17 18:37:27 I live in Texas. I manage to stay out of the pocket of oil and gas. 

It's not hard to say "no" after you promise not to take their money. He's a figure head, not a leader.
3271 2018-12-17 18:37:03 Fools like jack of some trades but master of none, rush in where IIT-IIM and even Harvard type angels fear to tread , to gauge so called snake oil salesman, ie?
3272 2018-12-17 18:36:59 LOL so it was commercial oil was it?
3273 2018-12-17 18:36:58 if you’re struggling with winter dryness (especially under makeup) take a warm damp real techniques sponge or a nude beauty blender, mix 100% glycerin and rosehip oil on the back of your hand, and pounce it into your face like foundation. follow up with your daily moisturizer 
3274 2018-12-17 18:36:57 Because our oil is more expensive
3275 2018-12-17 18:36:45 Fear God madam, 
3276 2018-12-17 18:36:36 China's non-commodity goods trade surplus = $700B.  If they can print CNY for commodity imports (see CNY oil contract), US will have BoP crisis before China.  If China can't, China will have crisis before US.  CNY contract is going way > expected.
3277 2018-12-17 18:36:30 Convert to gas heat if you can! We use it here and it's so much less expensive than oil or electric. And one of these days I'm going to take you up on the offer, I promise!!

3280 2018-12-17 18:36:04 Born and raised to love the oil but man these @NHLFlames are fun to watch.. what a solid d core, is this acceptable being the battle of Alberta ??
3281 2018-12-17 18:35:53 Came in for an oil change leaving with a bigger tab then I anticipated
3282 2018-12-17 18:35:52 Would you send your oil through a pipeline built and maintained same frogs that built the Olympic stadium ?
3283 2018-12-17 18:35:48 The real scandal is the reason that the price IS down, because it's due in part to the fact that this administration has opened federal land to oil drilling in order to make the United States the world's leading producer of planet-killing, increasingly worthless dino syrup.
3284 2018-12-17 18:35:41 Oil ye cream
3285 2018-12-17 18:35:41 I’m not sure where you chart came from but Canada  has the worlds 3rd largest oil reserves and is shown near the bottom of this chart. Totally incorrect graphic.
3286 2018-12-17 18:35:22 I think @JavierBlas means dedicated oil hedge funds. There are lots of leveraged investors that play in the oil space, but few are masochistic enough to restrict themselves to this one sector.
3287 2018-12-17 18:35:09 Why are we trying to grow the oil sector? You've heard of #climatechange? We need to get RID of the oil sector and here you are bragging about making it bigger. What the hell are you doing??!?
3288 2018-12-17 18:35:09 I don't bash him so this is cheating but I would like to add one - free choclit (without palm oil)
3289 2018-12-17 18:35:07 Jon, so very true! Today I had a 'delicious' mushroom omelette with salad. I garnished the salad with olive oil and vinegar. Putting Worcestershire sauce on the omelette. Don't eat too many potatoes or red meat, go for chicken. Try walking, and you will lose weight. Kind regards!
3290 2018-12-17 18:35:01 I just need my oil changed and he doing all this extra shit
3291 2018-12-17 18:34:55 If you're eating a balanced diet but half of your calories come from corn syrup and soy bean oil is it really balanced? 
3292 2018-12-17 18:34:45 I'm with you. CNN is without a soul. Santorum also took money from big oil, and CNN had him on criticizing climate scientists. With no disclosure that he's compromised.
3293 2018-12-17 18:34:42 Btw if you use castor oil on your hair then in how many weeks will you see an improvement?? I wanna try it
3294 2018-12-17 18:34:35 Currently walking up and down Nova while my car gets an oil change.

It is part of home training to mind your business.

3303 2018-12-17 18:33:49 Whistler was clear on their stance with oil companies and I like that. I’ll never go there now and I wish other communities and companies were as transparent so I can choose if I wish to spend my money there.

3306 2018-12-17 18:33:19 I need some sweet oil for my ear
3307 2018-12-17 18:33:13 Why are the media not asking why we continue to buy Saudi Oil. Looking more like the national media bought and paid for. What is their reasoning in not asking that question?
3308 2018-12-17 18:33:11 We should have nothing further to do with Saudi Arabia!  They are Murderers and we don't need their Oil!
3309 2018-12-17 18:32:54 No offense but all they do anymore is fight YOUR oil wars....
3310 2018-12-17 18:32:52 Thek hai oil laga lena
3311 2018-12-17 18:32:48 I need to stop online shopping. 

Seriously just bought 3 new bathing suits, a sun hat, Essential oil defuser for my plane trips & so much more dumb shit for my upcoming trips.

Send help.
3312 2018-12-17 18:32:42 whenever i see the word oil i always read it in my head in my mums voice ie “hOILuh”
3313 2018-12-17 18:32:29 If I tell you I want 10W-40 for my oil, give me 10W-40. That’s what my dad tells me to get smh don’t question me 
3314 2018-12-17 18:32:25 Tell them a Prince requires $100,000 deposited into a bank regulated by the Central Bank of Nigeria in order to assist the Nigerian Petroleum Company in partaking in oil exploration within other parts of the world. This $100,000 deposit will yield 10% of 40 million US dollars
3315 2018-12-17 18:32:23 An oil defuser or maybe some cool shoes
3316 2018-12-17 18:32:07 I don't necessarily have an order; sometimes I come up with a message/meaning before I know what any of it will look like, and sometimes that part comes to me as I'm painting. I am still very new to oil painting and am learning as I go, (continued)
3317 2018-12-17 18:32:02 #NATO and  US brought their special kind of democracy and freedom.  They may have pumped the oil Wells dry, but that's a price for all that freedom. Free not to have a job, free to starve, free to be homeless and a refugee, free to be in constant state of war... Ah Freedom 
3318 2018-12-17 18:32:02 Yes, the Persian Gulf - the oil tankers from Mid-East pass thru there.  Mid-East confuses me.  So much involved there.

3319 2018-12-17 18:32:01 all i can say is PLEB, or oil level indicator (Dip Stick)
3320 2018-12-17 18:31:57 he took excellent care of it and finessed the dealership. They added the bug guards, window louvers, 5 cd changer and the tool box. He made them agree in the contract that every other oil change would be free and lifetime balance & rotation of any tires
3321 2018-12-17 18:31:55 Have you tried CBD oil yet?
3322 2018-12-17 18:31:53 Oil pen dreams are no joke like last night my dream was that marilyn manson was holding me captive. It was the most stressful dream I’ve had in a while honestly
3323 2018-12-17 18:31:50 My dad did my oil change and bought me new brakes for Christmas. WHAT A GUY 
3324 2018-12-17 18:31:49 Hiring Bernhardt is like designating an oil refinery to be used as a water purification plant.
3325 2018-12-17 18:31:47  we give our pug girls three drops of Hemp Oil  each on food in the morning & three drops each on food in the evening, pugs each weigh 18 lbs. You have to go by weight. Directions on bottle & amazon. 
3326 2018-12-17 18:31:45 Who? Chuka "Snake Oil" Umunna? Yvette Cooper? David Big Bucks Milliband?
3327 2018-12-17 18:31:43 Omggggggggg i swear y’all. Im at lunch with my girls from work.. we are doing our Christmas gift exchange and this customer texts me 10 times and calls me 3 wanting to know what kind of oil to put in her car THAT JUST HAD THE OIL CHANGED.. WTF
3328 2018-12-17 18:31:37 Hmmm, gearbox rotated 90 degrees,interesting. I wonder what's up with that patch over the oil pump? And is that a Rickman frame? Very interesting indeed.

3337 2018-12-17 18:31:00 I am not sure of that. Remember that most shale oil producers do not get WTI prices but a discount of about USD 8. And shale is a game of drilling more and more wells due to fast depletion. Hard to see US production growing above 1m bpd this year with WTI sub 60.

Keto Coffee!
Why?
Because it already has MCT Oil, collagen and grass-fed butter in it! This little fuel keeps me going throughout my workouts and keeps me feeling full!
It is the BOMBdiggity!
3341 2018-12-17 18:30:47 If you're planning on getting those Christmas gift items like bags of rice, vegetable oil & other foodstuff, pls do it immediately. Prices have started to jump.

Ordinary 5kg bag of rice from last week at N1,600 has jumped to N2,200 as at today

Can bet other items will also jump
3342 2018-12-17 18:30:42 yes because any socialist is pro-Israel and takes lobbyist money from oil corporations
3343 2018-12-17 18:30:36 Oil prices rose, but investor sentiment remained under pressure from oversupply and concern over the prospects for global economic growth and fuel demand

3349 2018-12-17 18:30:12 I had forgotten about your shrill Tory tripe. Have the Tories banned palm oil yet? How are they doing with helium balloons and blazing lanterns floating around the countryside. Nothing as usual.
3350 2018-12-17 18:29:56 Feel like watching a western movie where someone steals someone's land to drill oil or some shit

It's sickening.

3355 2018-12-17 18:29:30 I'm so economical I keep an emptied oil can. When it's time to boil noodles, I fill up the oil can, shake it, and use the oily water to boil the noodles real good in residue oil.

3359 2018-12-17 18:29:08 Rather than oil my beard, I marmite my moustache when I am going out.  I can then lick it along the way.
3360 2018-12-17 18:29:06 Wouldn't it be great if we had a pipeline like line 9 that could supply all eastern Canadian demand so we could stop buying foreign oil at higher prices.
3361 2018-12-17 18:29:03 No you’re right cause good luck if anything goes wrong or you need an oil change or literally anything cause you won’t be able to afford it
3362 2018-12-17 18:28:59 The Idiot N chief has de-regulated every protection he could undo single handedly because of his love affair with corporate America.

3368 2018-12-17 18:27:56 In Nigeria, Agriculture is the next “Crude Oil”, this being a valid projection, Governor Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State, a visionary leader established a Fertilizer Blending Factory, so the state can lead in this new narrative when it’s time.

3376 2018-12-17 18:27:37 Saudi determine weither the oil price increase or reduce, now trump is working with them to see that oil price drop more and that's one of the reason why Trump have failed to condemn the crown prince regarding the murdered journalist, Trump is pressuring them to produce more
3377 2018-12-17 18:27:23 They have sold enough oil though..
3378 2018-12-17 18:27:18 My heart weeps for the Body when I hear ministers preach false/incorrect doctrines, thereby keeping God's people subjugated. Anointing oil, pleading the blood, Holy Ghost fire, and all such false doctrines are keeping God's people ignorant of their position in Christ. Help, Lord
3379 2018-12-17 18:27:16 i could come over rn but i don’t have your oil and i won’t wanna leave

3385 2018-12-17 18:26:31 Yes they can and do to the limit of line 9. 

Which explains why our Sask oil that goes in to line 9 gets a higher price.
3386 2018-12-17 18:26:30 Oh. It is about time it gets out there. So I am burning the midnight oil to make it happen. I'll look forward to your review. :)
3387 2018-12-17 18:26:29 things you wouldn't expect to hear: 

was a great 18 for many ag markets. corn, oats, wheat, cattle all up on the year. many by large margins. beans only down 4.5% (small in context of supply outlook), meal flat, oil -14%, hogs -10%. might even say a farmer should be optimistic.
3388 2018-12-17 18:26:23 for the next 10 years, more or less, the defining technology shifts might be:
electric vehicle market maturation
smaller scale, modular, standardized nuclear
less oil, more nat gas, lng
commodity solar panel construction skins
organic neural gaming-I don't know what this is, LoL
3389 2018-12-17 18:26:21 Crush is going to slow right?  Swine Fever and Argy coming back online in 2019.  If demand stays strong things could get tight very quick on oil.
3390 2018-12-17 18:26:02 Q410: Oil fellow's put into seats (8)
3391 2018-12-17 18:26:00 solid coconut oil @ room temp turns me on 
3392 2018-12-17 18:25:59 “o” oil boom was so bad Diesel engines had to use all the oil for frying chicken . #ateyearswithoutchicken #mcga 
3393 2018-12-17 18:25:44 Bottom line is Quebec “government”(shouldn’t include all Québécois) do not support Alberta and Western Canadian oil and that should include the federal government.
3394 2018-12-17 18:25:40 We have sent Trillions over the years in money and weapons. All for the dream of Isreal, the US and the UK controlling the oil in that region. Apparently, your strict moral code extends to picking off peaceful protesters and playing children perched on top of rooftops and hills.
3395 2018-12-17 18:25:40 David, so sorry that you are in hospital unwell, you have been through enough. Well, the gas stack is flaring, and one or two tankers a day still we think. I am guessing you are feeling a little brighter and now picking up the updates? I have followed you so shall be in touch xx
3396 2018-12-17 18:25:38 My oil company Sister, come through for your girl
3397 2018-12-17 18:25:14 Burnt oil and dodo together

3399 2018-12-17 18:25:11 Army of slaughter and vandalism, are you guys done seeking illegal oil? Baby killer Nigeria army. 

Your strength is only shown when it comes to weak women and unarmed civilians. 

#Liberia and Biafra is so alive, the world knows how barbaric you monsters are.
3400 2018-12-17 18:25:05 not only did eric take my car to get the oil changed, he also is washing it for me while i’m at school

3402 2018-12-17 18:25:01 Crazy how @DNC always says their fighting the rich yet judging by @BarackObama gas prices on this alone it sure looks like they are making them wealthier & hurting the rest of us as with @realDonaldTrump the oil giants are making less & we are saving money. Right?
3403 2018-12-17 18:24:46 I never understood the beef between hairstylists & oil/grease...hair be beautiful then the hours later lookin dry and brittle as hell

3406 2018-12-17 18:24:09 I hate all of the residents at the residences in the group home, because they treat me like crap after I was smashing the disgusting Pomade green grease oil at my room last weekend and stump it on my feet behind the floor and they're gonna kill me to death as hell!! 
3407 2018-12-17 18:23:47 Oh bhae Olive oil mai kon deep frying krta hai?
3408 2018-12-17 18:23:36 Apart from the oil and gas market, what’s the biggest market trend in/for Nigeria? I’m curious...
3409 2018-12-17 18:23:33 Virgin olive oil from?
3410 2018-12-17 18:23:30 orcas/salmon/ water/oil spills are very REAL
3411 2018-12-17 18:23:28 Aye,and didn't cameron and osborne slip up on TV when they (both,on differant ocassions)say"The UK aren't as well off as Norway (despite the same oil reserves)is because the UK population is 60Million but Norways is only 4.5million(roughly the same as Scotlands)...cat oot the bag
3412 2018-12-17 18:23:18 strange disconnect spx and oil futures with spx  testing morning lows and crude currently higher low however still bad feeling as to powell wed
3413 2018-12-17 18:23:16 Ngeliat 10 langkah skincare rutin a la Korea kok rasanya ribet bgt. Eh ternyata skincare malem gue juga banyak:) Milkcleanser, facial wash, toner, exfo toner, essence, lotion, serum, krim malem, face oil...... :|
3414 2018-12-17 18:23:15 yes but since this foundation is oil based it’s harder on it jdjskdj
3415 2018-12-17 18:23:04 Oil dey your head
3416 2018-12-17 18:23:00 Can you eat stew and engine oil 
3417 2018-12-17 18:22:53 My fave. I also add chamomile oil
3418 2018-12-17 18:22:42 There's lots of evidence that lower oil doesn't provide growth. It is not a flow thru tax cut either. Lower energy prices are signals that economies aren't using as much energy
3419 2018-12-17 18:22:25 Acting Interior Sec. David Bernhardt lobbied for Taylor Energy, Cadiz Inc, Halliburton Energy Services, Targa Energy, Noble Energy, NRG Energy, Eni Petroleum, Sempra Energy, the U.S. Oil and Gas Association and the Independent Petroleum Association of America #corrupt
3420 2018-12-17 18:22:19 Energy has no stability with President Trump in office.  He wants oil low.  Crushing Texas.  Mass layoffs will be happening and u can thank trump
3421 2018-12-17 18:22:19 Yeah, sand through 60, 80, 120, 180, and 220 grit, then wipe on the beeswax/mineral oil wood-butter and dry in greenhouse for a week, wiping new finish on every-other day. 
Some are gifts others I sell.
This is my winter job.
3422 2018-12-17 18:22:05 Does anybody know what essential oil to use to repel away married men ?
3423 2018-12-17 18:21:44 Organic kokonut oil
3424 2018-12-17 18:21:24 Girl the words cod liver oil make me sick. My great grandma used to make us take it for no reason.
3425 2018-12-17 18:21:15 オリーブ油で毎日を楽しく(*^_^*)
3426 2018-12-17 18:21:11 Just in case you're unaware, Beto signed a pledge not to take money from oil and gas and then he took money from oil and gas.
3427 2018-12-17 18:21:09 pretty sure i got a redlight ticket yesterday and my car has a coolant AND oil leak so i would like more hours at work please Mr. Santa
3428 2018-12-17 18:21:07 But, we do not want PPP in power, never. When ever PPP government came they put people in line for Cooking Oil, Sugar, Flour and Cement etc.
3429 2018-12-17 18:21:06 Acting Interior Sec. David Bernhardt lobbied for Taylor Energy, which has leaked 100s of barrels/oil daily into Gulf of Mexico for 14 yrs; Taylor is still lobbying Interior thru Bernhardt’s former firm.
3430 2018-12-17 18:21:02 Essential oil safety info!
3431 2018-12-17 18:20:58 vitamin e oil at night also works wondersss
3432 2018-12-17 18:20:56 Stole my mother's precious chicken from the cage. Killed it. Fried it with her groundnut oil. And carried the whole chicken to my boyfriend. Came back after receiving preeq to drink my garri with kulikuli.
3433 2018-12-17 18:20:55 So, today the car's battery went flat. We charged it up. The oil warning light went on. We topped it up. Then a tyre fell off. We've given up and decided to have a quiet evening at home.
3434 2018-12-17 18:20:52 Putin and India would not be pleased ,neither Israel which have oil deals negotiated for the eastern Iranian oil fields now being developed.
3435 2018-12-17 18:20:40 จริงๆ รอบชุดราตรีควรจะเปลี่ยนจากการชูความเป็นไทยเพราะคุณได้ทำออกมาแล้วในชุดประจำชาติอ่ะ ควรเป็นแบบสากลใส่แล้วเป็นชุดที่เข้ากับบุคลิกนางงามจริงๆ
3436 2018-12-17 18:20:34 Just wondering @UrbanDecay do you use palm oil in your products?
3437 2018-12-17 18:20:32 I was checking the oil on my car and this random ass man crossed the street and came up to me, asking if I need help. MIND YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS DUDE
3438 2018-12-17 18:20:25 Oh yeah to disrupt and destabilize the country because China’s largest oil company signed an exploration agreement with Somalia in 2007
3439 2018-12-17 18:20:15 And lets be clear. There are many more who couldn’t make this event.  Hear us Ms. Premier and Mr Prime minister. We are tired of having our industry vilified. We are the most environmental, safety, consultative oil industry in the world and are very proud of it. #Separation AB
3440 2018-12-17 18:20:09 Yes of course your father do job for poverity faloody wala.sharbat wala rikshy wala,ayan model wala,omni fraud etc etc.  Meter reader khursheed shah lier bloody sharjeel honey and olive oil wala
3441 2018-12-17 18:20:03 i’m gonna go out and buy an oil based makeup remover hold Hold.
3442 2018-12-17 18:20:00 getting my oil changed give me so much anxiety. having 3 men roast me on the condition of my car...
3443 2018-12-17 18:19:58 Isn't Obama the one who absolutely did not want any oil drilling? Pollution. Put restrictions on that.
3444 2018-12-17 18:19:30 Does the Canadian gov’t purchase oil from Saudi Arabia or is it imported by private entities?
3445 2018-12-17 18:19:23 Oil workers would be all over it
3446 2018-12-17 18:19:15 Who ordered me a sleep assist oil?! I might love you 
3447 2018-12-17 18:19:15 酒
3448 2018-12-17 18:19:08 Try garlic, preferably the oil
3449 2018-12-17 18:19:03 goldman gets another sell order in gold and oil
3450 2018-12-17 18:19:02 Candles, but oil sometimes as a kid. My parents collected chanukiyot and had about 75. We each chose one to light each night. #BizGalz
3451 2018-12-17 18:18:56 石油だってオリーブオイルだって変わらぬオイルだ。だからみんな、資源は大切に使おう。
3452 2018-12-17 18:18:42 i get horrible indigestion from ibuprofen, and no matter what i’ve done in the past it’s never gone away until it went away.

i just rubbed some of the chronic tonic CBD oil on my neck and chest. my indigestion was gone in two minutes. this shit is real.
3453 2018-12-17 18:18:28 Look how mi want likkle argan oil.Fumbled sugar bags could have funded that
3454 2018-12-17 18:18:24 You're not counting the Saudi oil refined in NB and sold in Quebec. You're deliberately hiding the whole story
3455 2018-12-17 18:17:49 In a Bear Market always focus on your Capital Preservation .
I am sitting on the Fence i see more downsize in all Markets, 
Oil will continue to slide. Gold is Looking Good

3459 2018-12-17 18:17:31 this is an oil based foundation
3460 2018-12-17 18:17:22 เออมีคนคิดแบบฉันด้วยเรื่องชุดที่บอกว่ามีแรงบันดาลใจมาจากฉลองพระองค์ ที่เคยเห็นๆมาก็มีแต่สวยๆ แต่ไหงเขาทำออกมาแบบนั้นเนาะ
3461 2018-12-17 18:17:19 @narendramodi sir, I'm a physically handicapped person I need your help in a situation where there's Indian oil petrol pump dealership tenders but I have come across such places which which isn't good to do business just because I'm a general category person
3462 2018-12-17 18:17:04 You might think this a joke.. but she was dead serious about pouring the oil on top.
3463 2018-12-17 18:17:01 I bought that fancy influencer coconut oil floss. I'm not ashamed. I like pretty shit and I hate flossing. Maybe the former will solve the latter.
3464 2018-12-17 18:16:54 LOL you think he's even close to a 4.56 40 or 38.5 vert at this point?! If you do, I've got some snake oil to sell you.
3465 2018-12-17 18:16:49 Probably right, but less constraints US policies could mean more projection. We'll see.

Regardless, I think two things humans are really good at is poking holes in the ground to look for oil, and building stadiums. Bith of which tend to be underrated in some circles.
3466 2018-12-17 18:16:17 Unbelievable. You mention climate change yet advocate for further oil development! If you truly want to achieve good, then submit a real carbon tax bill to incentivize Clean Energy and force Fossil Fuel to pay for destruction it is costing. Start here, then make it a global.
3467 2018-12-17 18:16:13 @BarackObama what a delusional liar you are! You had NOTHING at all to do with the oil boom we are experiencing. You cut production. You wanted us dependent on other countries. Stop trying to take credit for ALL TRUMP IS DOING!!
3468 2018-12-17 18:15:54 It’s motor oil they don’t use real syrup for commercials that’s why the people never actually eat it
3469 2018-12-17 18:15:35 Towel over your head over a bowl of steaming water and breathe in the steam. Helps clear the congestion. Vicks menthol or olbas oil added help too but not essential.
3470 2018-12-17 18:15:28 Mcmuffin is like 7th in the entire NHL in penalties drawn and all I’ve seen on my timeline for the last two weeks is oilers fans crying about how they don’t call enough penalties on him. Christ oil have 13 more PP chances than the leafs this year 
3471 2018-12-17 18:15:27 It’s not even the people in power. It’s inability to take a new necessity seriously. We need to put an oil or car company out of business. Then it would become clear that cities need to change even more than just banning cars. They also need to move out of the valleys.
3472 2018-12-17 18:15:25 Are you into holistic remedies? pure jasmine essential oil is known to help induce labor through stimulating contractions, it also eases pain. As well as Clary Sage & Rose oil 
3473 2018-12-17 18:15:21 2/n 
US needed Pak's land to wage proxy war with USSR.
China needs it for the oil route. 
Last year Saudi wanted Pak army to fight Syria
3474 2018-12-17 18:15:16 That will work great until the first oil change is required.
3475 2018-12-17 18:15:07 It's pure snake oil and an excuse for people to brag about how well thry are doing. Gives me the shits

Did you know... 
Rosemary Essential Oil can help you study and give you clear thinking?!?!
3481 2018-12-17 18:14:22 We did a lot of different techniques. They spent one day using oil pastels and drawing to the music then they went over the oil pastel with watercolor then I had different stations where they could stamp they could use stencils they could use metallics and some other stuff as wel
3482 2018-12-17 18:14:10 I do not think there is anything near term that will make a big change in oil prices. Eventually low prices will slow the growth of US shale oil and time is needed for the OPEC cut to work itself out. Plus demand growth which also takes time.
3483 2018-12-17 18:14:06 I'd love to lick and kiss that hot ass before I oil it all over slowly!!!
3484 2018-12-17 18:13:58 ...the largest oil reserves off the coast. I fear the excuse of terrorism is merely a mask for the ulterior motives of corporate overlords.
3485 2018-12-17 18:13:27 Biden will drop lower in the "polls" as will Beto after they reveal that they still adhere to corporate neoliberal policies. like how can Beto O'Rourke be a contender when he takes oil and gas money from the fossil fuel industry!?

3487 2018-12-17 18:13:18 Patrick is a  sports performer that likes Olive oil on their sausage pizza with white wine
3488 2018-12-17 18:12:49 they invited the US in to steal 90% of Syria’s oil from the Syrian people (who are indeed represented by their popular elected president Bashar al-Assad), it’s not hard to understand
3489 2018-12-17 18:12:44 Really? Even HSA is saying the wall is not a feasible remedy. Border patrol is asking for security, not a wall. 1.3 billion allocated for 2018 for this project, almost 1 billion not touched. Trump is a snake oil salesman and a stain to the presidency.
3490 2018-12-17 18:12:28 Your furnace likely doesn't burn oil. On the prairies it is fossil gas.

Why are you arguing for a loss of technology?
3491 2018-12-17 18:12:25 So by this logic @Progresscdn you're FOR the energy east pipeline? If they're buying oil anyway, why not Canadian?

3496 2018-12-17 18:12:04 There are still innumerable IIT-IIM and even Havard types who are yet to come out of his vicious spell. At the core lies their hatred for non-hindus and lower strata and also advocacy for brahmanical patriarchy. This is exactly what this snake oil salesmen wants
3497 2018-12-17 18:11:59 OMG, what a witty response. I’ve not been butthurt, but I have been bantering with dumb people like you on Twitter because I can’t get over how ignorant you and others are. Deliberately working against your own best interest because some charlatan is selling you snake oil.

3499 2018-12-17 18:11:47 Just shows you how easy it is for @JustinTrudeau to sacrifice thousands of high-paying middle class jobs - at least equivalent to GM's closing in Oshawa that was greeted as if the sky were falling - in order to supposedly look good on the world stage. But Saudi oil keeps flowing.
3500 2018-12-17 18:11:30 You mean like a military rule Algeria with Bouteflika getting 80-90% of the "votes" , where they can´t even afford food because their economy is inflated, despite having oil and gas..., military rule is NEVER good, it´s a weakness rather than a strenght
3501 2018-12-17 18:11:23 Not that simple ... at 5% of the cars being Electric the gas vehicles can "pay" for the Electric but what happens if and when 50% of the  cars on the road are electric? This a more complex question than "evil government" in the pocket of "big oil."

3509 2018-12-17 18:11:00 Presumably need an exogenous driver (e.g., oil in the 70’s). Unlikely to be oil this time given our newfound independence.

What could it be? I find macro variables to be unknowable even within a range & thus macro models to have little predictive power. I defer to someone else.

The President gave all of them TAX cuts now look what in return they do to US ?So do they base Dow Jones on the oil sold or the economics growth? The sale are real good so don’t even try to tell us different.
3522 2018-12-17 18:09:49 oil companies only doing what decades of bad conservative AB govts allowed. Saved nothing for the bad times. Oil co. political interference is a real concern.
3523 2018-12-17 18:09:48 The norwegian welfare system is built with oil money. Free helthcare, meds, schools... you ooze of swedish envie
3524 2018-12-17 18:09:41 GB Hamd-pulled Noodles (Edward) were great! Great bounce on the noodle. That Szechuan peppercorn chilli oil is one amazing condiment too
3525 2018-12-17 18:09:28 Yeah nothing to do with oil.  The Kurds actually sell the oil to Iraq, Syria and Turkey and 10 percent actually goes to the Syrian Regime.  We don’t get any profits off of it.  Even if we did get profit off it wouldn’t be worth a war as it’s not that much.

3528 2018-12-17 18:09:12 Don't use it anywhere on a bicycle. A bike requires multiple parts to stay lubricated with oil. Wd40 is a solvent with an oil base. It will permanently bond with your bike's grease. While also dissolving it.
3529 2018-12-17 18:09:07 Try cbd oil
3530 2018-12-17 18:09:02 If we stopped all oil and gas production for a week in Canada I wonder how Eastern Canada would feel in minus low temperatures? Or how much more they would have to pay for their Saudi oil? Or how little transfer payments they  might get! Might change their minds!
3531 2018-12-17 18:08:53 Russia is the biggest classical imperialist still loose in the World. Hopefully it will shrink a bit when the oil and gas revenue implodes in the near future.
3532 2018-12-17 18:08:34 ช่วงนี้แย่จัง กว่าจะผ่านไปได้ในแต่ละวัน สาหัสเอาเรื่องอยู่เหมือนกัน สติไม่มี บ้า ไม่เป็นตัวของตัวเองเลยยย เดี๋ยวสักวันมันจะดีขึ้น แต่แค่ยังไม่ใช่ตอนนี้หรือเร็วๆนี้
3533 2018-12-17 18:08:31 So, last payday, I picked up some CBD oil that's triple the strength of what I've been using. It is a fucking mutilator.
Last PM, couldn't sleep, did a double dose and then did another.
Woke up, felt great.
And then it struck me as I showered: Dude, you are still rattlin'.

3535 2018-12-17 18:08:26 Correct sir
3536 2018-12-17 18:08:24 gays should start a campaign to make "frack my ****" a popular phrase so that big oil and corporate congressmembers will end fracking
3537 2018-12-17 18:08:15 The car was so dry, we wanted to apply oil on it.
3538 2018-12-17 18:08:13 Oil changed and new windshield wipers...Merry Christmas to myself.
3539 2018-12-17 18:07:59 Perhaps they could do a gender analysis or downstream and upstream carbon analysis of saudi oil?
3540 2018-12-17 18:07:50 U probably think i live in desert and have bunch of oil gallons and camels outside well ur wrong cuz I’m broke as fuckk
3541 2018-12-17 18:07:49 Fuck oil money. Real estate money is where it’s at.
3542 2018-12-17 18:07:39 You can tell a lot about someone’s kitchen and life by the kind of cooking oil they have on hand
3543 2018-12-17 18:07:34 The Farkas energy industry advocacy motion is slanted to oil industry only.  No advocacy on behalf of or encouragement for Alberta wind, solar or geothermal portions of the industry. If you think those parts of the industry are not discriminated against, think again #yyccc #yyc
3544 2018-12-17 18:07:26 Once again @CBCNews shows their ignorance of the oil industry using the term “oilpath” in a headline about the Grande Prairie rally instead of the correct term Oilpatch  #cdnpoli
3545 2018-12-17 18:07:22 Funny how the smell of too much oil affects the brain makes you lose all common sense. So dont stand too close to the oil well.
3546 2018-12-17 18:07:21 instead of getting an oil change yesterday i accidentally took a four hour nap and now i have to face the consequences of that when my car explodes
3547 2018-12-17 18:07:14 No I've heard, olive oil, when cooked, acts as a poison.

3554 2018-12-17 18:06:21 @JWagnerFXTrader ..Hey Jeremy did you haveva webinar today?I was hoping you could shed some light on the crude oil pattern
3555 2018-12-17 18:06:10 1 kg of hard cheese is prepared from 16 liters of fresh milk plus two years of aging. Cheese with palm oil is cheaper.
3556 2018-12-17 18:06:08 Fuck I took expired fish oil and now my stomach hurts 
3557 2018-12-17 18:05:51 Instead of coming down here to hear grievances and see what is going on they are charging protesters organizers for cutting off the oil.
3558 2018-12-17 18:05:49 & that box be slippery like tryna walk on oil.
3559 2018-12-17 18:05:43 Pls check 2014 and 2017-18 crude oil price. Share that data to me, I keep that for reference.
Meanwhile, for s developing countries like India the fuel price should not decrease still certain stage, which will affect our GDP.
3560 2018-12-17 18:05:38 Between this hair oil I conjured up and leave in conditioner mixed water spray, my locs have been growing like wildflower.
3561 2018-12-17 18:05:31 Same with you lot, can’t let Manchester oil money win the league
3562 2018-12-17 18:05:06 Bullshit.   They allowed Islamic State to sell oil through Turkey for years.  It was Russia that ended Islamic State oil sales.   I would advise you to research outside of US propaganda.
3563 2018-12-17 18:05:05 peppermint oil is your friend. 4oz bottles from plant therapy (free shipping) or from amazon. mix with water and rubbing alcohol and spray EVERYTHING ONCE A WEEK. it keeps out bugs and mice and smells minty fresh! i live in the woods with roaches that fall from trees. it SUCKS!
3564 2018-12-17 18:05:03 Flat out refuses to answer the question. 

Let me simplify it for you:

Choose one. Alberta Oil, or oil from Nigeria/Saudi Arabia/Venezuela.

Question can’t be more simple.
3565 2018-12-17 18:05:01 Good luck holding onto that fallacy. The projects proceed as the cost of tight oil production in the USA rises. Given the 70% child vs parent well ratio in the two biggest fields, it's merely a matter of time.
3566 2018-12-17 18:04:56 Still no facts about how the oil sands is a malign industry or your preference for international oil over domestic. And we need oil. I’m all for reduction on our need for it, but we do need it.
3567 2018-12-17 18:04:48 Add to that the cast iron produces SO much smoke unless you use grapeseed oil.
3568 2018-12-17 18:04:45 Looks like lots of oiltankers going to the east coast and it seems no one is against this oil traffic
3569 2018-12-17 18:04:28 The palm oil.
One of the supermarkets wasn't it which were banned from showing it!(flicks self in head)I thought it was about the wood
3570 2018-12-17 18:04:27 Well worth it! I'm amazed how cheap they are. Ordered some pine needle oil to complete the Christmas effect 
3571 2018-12-17 18:04:26 I wonder when the world will move completely away from crude oil. 
Many countries have moved progressively toward renewable energy. 
Let the Earth rest and renew itself.
3572 2018-12-17 18:04:23 Hot oil slowly dripping on your back followed by a massage 
3573 2018-12-17 18:04:18 Okay. I was going to do so. Thanks for the reply.
3574 2018-12-17 18:04:04 It's inevitable. The return of gold is showing up between Russia & China. Who no longer trade in petrodollar for oil. China now pays Russia for oil in petroyuan backed by gold. At any rate Trump must at least federalize the fed.
3575 2018-12-17 18:03:58 I use a lemon sugar scrub! I bought mine but you can easily mix Coconut oil and sugar and just rub it on your lips before washing your face. Sometimes I use a soft bristle tooth brush and lightly brush my lips too while I brush my teeth.
3576 2018-12-17 18:03:53 One can have their economy stimulated by the drive to become "the biggest oil producer in the world" or one can "benefit from lower oil prices."  Both narratives cannot be simultaneously true
3577 2018-12-17 18:03:52 Olive oil
3578 2018-12-17 18:03:51 Somebody come take my car to get an oil change
3579 2018-12-17 18:03:50 Finally getting my car a oil change it’s way overdue 
3580 2018-12-17 18:03:49 Good. Northern Ontario didnt want it either, except the trump/Ford lovers who didn't move to Alberta for the oil...

Esp FNs.

Refine it in Alberta.
3581 2018-12-17 18:03:42 An innocent man died while serving his job. You have done well. You can now rest for eternity.

 But the minister's statement about blaming the police is not making this issue solved but just throwing oil to the fire. Be respectful minister of 'unity'. #Justice4Adib
3582 2018-12-17 18:03:41 @clarkecooper i saw you on smile JA this morning, and it seems that your migraine still an issue. Have you tried albas oil? Buy a bottle and put some on a piece of cotton and place it under your pillow at night. And in the day put a lil in your rag and inhale it.
3583 2018-12-17 18:03:36 Bitch I’m getting my oil changed then I have work! Come with me and my coworkers we’re gunna Xmas shop and drink tmrw
3584 2018-12-17 18:03:29 It’s basically a face mist/ toner. Rose water reduces inflammation which helps fight existing acne, and helps prevent them from coming, I also us aloe, which hazel, and a skin oil blend to help reduce the size of pores, occurrence of acne, and brighten the skin!
3585 2018-12-17 18:03:27 Republican politicians are lying hypocritical cowards, who talk a big game about family values, God and country, but have shown that they are just snake oil salesman.  Unbelievable that the GOP would support a man who stands shoulder to shoulder with a fascist pig like Vlad Putin
3586 2018-12-17 18:03:26 Oil Subsidy Debt you said N350bn inherited by Buhari 2015  why are will paying N800bn now

3591 2018-12-17 18:02:46 Fascinating to see just how shitey pants they are about Scottish Independence. A broader context of a much larger Brexit disruption but it's still a free Scotland that terrifies them most. I wonder oil why oil that it is oil.
3592 2018-12-17 18:02:41 No he wants Texas Oklahoma Colorado New Mexico Louisiana Alaska assembling iPhones at minimum wage.  He only cares about low oil thinking it helps his real estate development costs.
3593 2018-12-17 18:02:33 Two big differences. China was leading that (could argue the same now but recent stimulus should arrest slowdown) & structural imbalances were big (& valuations).
Oil was below $50 which shut down production.  At these prices demand gets a boost while production doesn’t roll over
3594 2018-12-17 18:02:33 I have like 10 Barristers on the TL, my baby is a barrister. Let’s see who would win? Take back your words or else DEJI will welcome you in the morning  

Deji was forming a hard guy before he was caught. You still have time to take back your words
3595 2018-12-17 18:02:27 Don’t forget the first time in 75 years...we are not oil dependent.  And we are headed to be the top oil exporting country in the world...possibly outdoing The Saudis.
3596 2018-12-17 18:02:20 "There was no manual for the Ripper in the tractor, which OSHA identified as a violation of Indianhead policy." Their lack of safe practices helps any survivors with lawsuits? Who protects earth, water, air, from DAPL oil exporters who forced themselves on us?
3597 2018-12-17 18:02:08 Out of stock across all Power Mac Stores. Maybe its a sign not to get it 
3598 2018-12-17 18:02:08 Our government chooses to enable oil to be purchased from foreign countries and has done everything they can to landlock our own. Denying this is not possible.

Put hemorrhoid cream under your eyes to instantly get rid of puffiness 

3602 2018-12-17 18:01:45 maybe if i drink enough olive oil tomorrow it’ll work
3603 2018-12-17 18:01:38 Coming to your point. If the debt is repaid, why not have the price aligned to crude oil price now?
3604 2018-12-17 18:01:27 I really hate getting my oil changed. #adulting
3605 2018-12-17 18:01:18 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
3606 2018-12-17 18:01:16 There will always be tension in the theocratic countries comprising the Middle East, especially when Israel is our ally. We don’t want to be beholden to them because of oil dependence. 

Because of Trump we have achieved almost complete oil independence. 1st time in decades.
3607 2018-12-17 18:01:12 “Hey Vlad, great idea! 
Instead of watching Hillary keep the restrictions on oil and gas, let’s help Trump and watch him lift them. 
It’ll drive up America’s supply and wreck our economy! 
We might even end up with a GDP even lower than LA County where it currently is.

3617 2018-12-17 18:00:16 Because we buy most of our oil now from the USA and the rest is Canadian oil, that is refined in Quebec. Because of its location, Irving buys from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela mainly. And the Canadian government does not buy oil, and it never has.
3618 2018-12-17 18:00:15 Flour, milk, eggs. Beat them in a bowl. Preheat the oven then when it’s hot pre heat the pan you’re cooking in, then put oil in the pan and warm that for a few minutes. Pour in the batter and bake until risen and golden. It’s also a Yorkshire pudding lol
3619 2018-12-17 18:00:14 and factories, and the oil rigs we continue to set up in the ocean and then pump the protect into our cars and such do a lot of damage as well, and until we find alternatives or politicians with a back bone the problem will persist

3624 2018-12-17 17:59:48 May be a lagged effect so will certainly be watching to see if true... After all, EM got pummeled in late 2014 through early 2015 w/ oil and it wasn't until oil rebound in 2015 that saw the revival in EM... Is it the lagged effect of cheaper oil or the correlation w/ oil prices?
3625 2018-12-17 17:59:47 Stop buying Saudi oil.

3627 2018-12-17 17:59:45 The absolutely “tell” Suncor where to buy the oil when they prevent a pipeline. If Quebec allowed free market access, do you honestly think Suncor would buy foreign oil over using their own?? Not a chance! Shocking how simple some folks are.

3642 2018-12-17 17:58:56 Putin didn’t start antagonism, Anglosphere did in 2003, when Putin nailed fraud Khodorkovsky b4 Kh could sell half his oil company to Exxon-Mobile.
3643 2018-12-17 17:58:54 Good. Oil sector is a little bit more slow moving in that regard. Hey, there were coal workers 10 years ago. Now theres not. Im ok with paying < 1.00 at the pump these days.
3644 2018-12-17 17:58:45 Heaters busted in the Jeep and it’s been leakin a bit of oil. Mom says she knows a place in town that does good work.

3645 2018-12-17 17:58:41 France is unreliable.

3650 2018-12-17 17:58:19 True. That's why the pipelines we are proposing have both Supplier & Client agreements with a minimum of 80% nominated.

You seem to forget that there is over 8 Million bpd Oilsands/Heavy Oil applications already in the AER queue. On crown leases already purchased.
3651 2018-12-17 17:58:05 Even without gerrymandering, states with small populations have disproportional advantages in both Senate & Electoral College. A cabal of American oligarchs exploited oil/mineral resources, gained wealth & power in these states, & now use government in DC against all of us.

Instead of watching Hillary keep the restrictions on oil and gas, let’s help Trump and watch him lift them. 
It’ll drive up America’s supply and wreck our economy! 
We might even end up with a GDP even lower than LA County where it currently is.”
3653 2018-12-17 17:57:28 Baby, Ki Kaishi Court for issuing a thread on me and public disturbance, he should be with Deji.
3654 2018-12-17 17:57:27 Enough oil for Americans to invade your plate
3655 2018-12-17 17:57:16 Please post crude oil price too. Not worth a report
3656 2018-12-17 17:57:15 Oil Rig is the song I put on at the gym for a heavy lift. So. Good. #ReleasetheSnyderCut #ZacksCut @HansZimmer
3657 2018-12-17 17:57:14 If people get another vote on the EU then Scotland MUST be allowed another referendum vote to leave the UK and take her oil and gas fields as well.#precedentset
3658 2018-12-17 17:57:08 Interestingly everything we've seen so far from the Steele Dossier has been corroborated.

It also says that Trump was offered 19% of the profits from brokerage commissions for Russian oil interests in return for lifting sanctions.

If true, this violates a LOT of laws.
3659 2018-12-17 17:56:45 Take back your words, or else you would be summoned in federal high court tomorrow morning.
3660 2018-12-17 17:56:38 So my mum has been taking CBD oil for over a month now and the amount of motor function she's regained is incredible. Stuff really if magic
3661 2018-12-17 17:56:36 Global demand for oil is increasing.  Always a market for our product and because of our heavily discounted price for Alberta bitumen, the US is making a killing because of the reduced price.
3662 2018-12-17 17:56:32 What all of Bamas sheep do not know is all the oil drilled when he was implementing islam upon America was done on PRIVATE Land...
3663 2018-12-17 17:56:18 THIS! I ain’t never been this dry in my life  and adding an oil or Shea butter slick not helping so idek what to do.
3664 2018-12-17 17:56:14 The downside to having a foreign car is the cost of maintenance for it. Like oh you need an oil change? That’ll be 120. Need transmission fluid? That’ll be 500 
3665 2018-12-17 17:56:13 3 words: Rick Simpson Oil
3666 2018-12-17 17:56:12 Drove my youngest to school, she asks “Dad ,you know saxophone and clarinet players have this valve oil right? You think it would work to help where my flute joins together?”
I immediately replied she’d need to ask her band teacher cause I’m not a musician, I’m a drummer
3667 2018-12-17 17:55:58 Olive oil no kids
3668 2018-12-17 17:55:57 Unbelievable. You mention climate change yet advocate for further oil development! If you truly want to achieve good, then submit a real carbon tax bill to incentivize Clean Energy and force Fossil Fuel to pay for destruction it is costing. Start here, then make it a global.
3669 2018-12-17 17:55:56  Oil
3670 2018-12-17 17:55:52 Nah fam , definitely some beard oil ...
3671 2018-12-17 17:55:50 Remember when there was an oil spill and they would sometimes feature children, holding an oil-soaked bird, quivering chin, tear on the cheek,  asking something like "why does big oil hate birds?"

I'm starting to think that, as with a free lunch, there's no free BTU.
3672 2018-12-17 17:55:45 The Saudis could care less. They will buy the armoured vehicle somewhere else. Trudeau if you want to make a statement, quit buying oil.
3673 2018-12-17 17:55:33 Every other oil producing country in the world allowing oilcos to set the terms doesn't mean Canada has to as well. Synthetic crude was invented here, and would be a higher value export to the benefit of our domestic economy...
3674 2018-12-17 17:55:30 Was under the impression that hemp derived cbd oil is legal everywhere. You may want to look into that.
3675 2018-12-17 17:55:27 Stuck here for the next 2 hours while I wait for my oil change  fun Monday...
3676 2018-12-17 17:55:20 Wow! They think Trump pats his own back too much! If he can take credit for the oil boom, then why can't he take credit for the seperation of children from mothers at the border? You can't have it both ways, a forked tongue doesn't split the truth, it just tells twice the lies!
3677 2018-12-17 17:55:20 Oil it with what?
3678 2018-12-17 17:55:16 @HHShkMohd About UAE and Tolerance two sides of a coin and LAW, what kind of justice you provided to me? You haven't paid for 40 oil paintings despite fully aware your own father-in-law and Nasser Abdulla Lootah cheated, passport held, blackmailed and taken me to Torture Chamber!
3679 2018-12-17 17:55:12 You know what I think about when I drive at night? Oil slick tow truck scams.
3680 2018-12-17 17:55:11 I asked Santa for a $518 heating oil bill and It showed up today! Hallelujah! It’s a Christmas miracle!
3681 2018-12-17 17:55:03 There seems to be this opinion that if a culture reaches a certain level of achievement, it must open its doors and share it with less-evolved cultures who do not appreciate these hard earned achievements. Wine and oil doesn't mix.
3682 2018-12-17 17:55:02 Heid can you give me a up date for let week, in Hospital with aother heart attack couldn't get on line p,ease
3683 2018-12-17 17:54:58 Bought some Meridian PB....no palm oil? Aldi sell one palm oil free too,
3684 2018-12-17 17:54:54 so car owners don't have used oil at home? 
3685 2018-12-17 17:54:48 My natural sedative: a warm bath with Himalayan salts and lavender oil followed by a cup of chamomile tea. Knocks me out.
3686 2018-12-17 17:54:38 Got my oil changed!
3687 2018-12-17 17:54:17 The Joy Williams song, .
3688 2018-12-17 17:54:13 I worked on offshore oil rigs in the 80's/90's here. There were MANY Albertans making their livings off Nova Scotia's oil & gas exploration. Nobody here cared where they came from as long as they could do their jobs. There's the difference between Alberta and the Maritimes.

3693 2018-12-17 17:53:41 As for why you choose not to see the rafts (or oil tankers by now) of evidence floating around... That's entire for you to look in yourself an answer
3694 2018-12-17 17:53:38 @EvanLSolomon @MercedesGlobal @VassyKapelos 
Could u pls ask Trudeau & not let him avoid answering
1 Will they apply the same conditions 2 foreign oil coming into Cdn as they are putting on AB oil
2 what price on pollution are they putting on raw sewage dumped into our waterways
3695 2018-12-17 17:53:31 Just took this piece of shit car to get an oil change... my car wont make it to NJ... I cant get a new car, I cant afford to fix this car and was adamantly told my timing belt could snap at any moment. I feel like throwing up.
3696 2018-12-17 17:53:27 Are you able to amend the graph, slightly to show Norways Total Revenue including oil over the same period. I have started to worry recently that this Government maybe incompetent.
3697 2018-12-17 17:53:23 Yeah, if you use a little bit of oil and fry it it gets little crispy bits which makes it so good

3700 2018-12-17 17:53:12 Still thinking of that video where Obama bragged about the U.S. becoming the biggest oil producer under his presidency and realizing he made "Drill baby, drill!" happen
3701 2018-12-17 17:53:02 Astonished that so few people in US seemed to be aware previously of 
a) US occupation of large part of Syria and 
b) that the area occupied contains most of Syria's oil. 

Was this never reported in US or what?

3711 2018-12-17 17:52:26 Yes I'm aware of these stats , but the defaults on small business leases and big layoffs of the high paid oil patch workers didn't really set in till 2016 to 2017. I'm looking at things real time and with field glasses forward. You are talking about data that's 3 years old.
3712 2018-12-17 17:52:20 Give it up for olive oil racist

3724 2018-12-17 17:51:13 Olives: a disgusting abomination. Keep them away from my food and cocktails.

Olive oil: a delight. Put it in or on everything I consume.
3725 2018-12-17 17:51:12 while countries like norway were saving and investing their oil funds and revenue.. Nigeria and Venezuela were making it rain and looting theirs 
SMH
3726 2018-12-17 17:51:03 Yes.  Let's reduce oil needs.  Reducing oil needs =/= limiting oil supply.  Limiting supply sends production to less responsible jurisdictions and without further global action does nothing to address demand.

But yes, these signs do nothing but hurt the cause.
3727 2018-12-17 17:50:49 Left behind? I own real estate and an oil company... if there is a new currency, I’ll just accept rent and payments for oil in the new currency...
3728 2018-12-17 17:50:47 I’m from Quebec and all people around me are OK to import and transport oil from AB. Our Elites are disconnected. You guys must keep up the pressure.

3730 2018-12-17 17:50:33 anyone who comments on this in a negative way needs to realize one thing: “Dubas is smarter than you and there is a reason he had this job. Sit down, be quiet and enjoy the ride”
He doesn’t come to your job and tell you when to take the fries out of the oil does he?!
3731 2018-12-17 17:50:29 Pure rose oil rubbed on your heart chakra ia magicc, too. Gratitude is my start to every single day since ever. It‘s been my routine even before I met my husband.

3737 2018-12-17 17:50:07 NUPENG no dey do anti-party or play politics. We're a union poised to pressure EVERY sitting government to do the right things in the oil sector, and from all indications @MBuhari deserves every accolade he's received.
3738 2018-12-17 17:50:02 What CBD oil do you use? My fiance has very similar back pain as yours.  thanks!

3741 2018-12-17 17:49:42 CBD is from hemp, not Marijuana. This is probably the biggest misconception. THC can be harmful to pets, CBD oil products typically contain 0-0.3% THC. Marijuana contains about 15-20% or more THC for refrence.

3749 2018-12-17 17:48:59 I grilled salmon for a seafood place for over a year. You cut it up into little three inch or four inch steaks, get ALL the bones out, grab a grill, spray it with cooking oil (be careful it will light up) then spray the side of the fish you're cooking first and put it that side

3751 2018-12-17 17:48:36 No, I'm one of the ones who thinks that Arabs killing other Arabs is none of our business.

If we're going to go to war over oil fields, we could at least take the oil.
3752 2018-12-17 17:48:22 Oil $80 , Bitcoin a buy how about calling out these Analysts.

3755 2018-12-17 17:48:04 How about just banning oil tankers from the East Coast. You know, just like HRH Mr. Groper is doing in the West Coast.
3756 2018-12-17 17:47:59 Besides castor oil what do adults drink to kipha iyongo? Need recommendations
3757 2018-12-17 17:47:54 Hello Deploribus! We would recommend using 4oz of the Ford Friction Modifier just to be safe.
3758 2018-12-17 17:47:52 No your right. Comparing Obama to Hitler for being tough on BP during the worst oil crisis in US history was a very sane comparison.
3759 2018-12-17 17:47:48 I paid for a hotel, got my own lingerie, got some rose petals,lit some candles,gave a massage wit the oil and I still get treated like dirt lmao
3760 2018-12-17 17:47:46 Growth stimulus from cheaper oil has actually been debunked by behavioral economists who detailed the tendency for consumers to buy less fuel efficient vehicles rather than save and/or spend that oil savings elsewhere... Look at trends with $GM and $F... Sedans are toast!

3765 2018-12-17 17:47:31 Harper’s approach was not to shut the oil industry down. Trudeau is  useless puppet when this country badly needs leadership.
3766 2018-12-17 17:47:26 Love it - knew 2 weeks ago when 9 rigs went online and more oil companies focusing on natty instead
3767 2018-12-17 17:47:25 LOL, we should try to help them too though like explain that the only people fucking them are the oil companies
3768 2018-12-17 17:47:14 Same Analysts that called oil $80 .  How about calling out Analysts . Anyone can call themselves one .
3769 2018-12-17 17:47:08 My question in all this is why do farmers continue to have to pay for research in new pay ideas etc yet oil and gas and solar and all other crap gets handed fed money for projects and research. Is it because farmers are easy to pick from?
3770 2018-12-17 17:47:02 Am I the only paki that hates getting oil put in their hair
3771 2018-12-17 17:47:01 Especially Saudi Arabia who is beginning its downhill slide with its loss of power with oil.
3772 2018-12-17 17:46:54 No doubts! Only SAA can overthrow all these poor and radicalised Oil lovers. If you can talk to the SAA, please do it, I don't want a Califat of cheap Oil at the top of our country:
-Saoudi Arabia would be angry
- Macron would remember khashoggi's episode with BIG anxiety

3773 2018-12-17 17:46:46 ODOT vision: turn Ohio into a giant automated trucking, oil & gas extraction hub (see: ODOT"s Access Ohio 2040 plans)

3774 2018-12-17 17:46:42 @630CHED We do not need money from Ottawa to do these innovative ideas with waste water, or better ways of refining oil. If this was Quebec you would see millions being spent to come to the same conclusion.

3782 2018-12-17 17:46:14 I have a personal goal to live like that; and to see god in everything. But I also have doubts that the CEOs of oil companies will agree in time to prevent disaster. So I would like to give them a lot more time to think about it after they are removed from power.

3785 2018-12-17 17:46:12 Because we need to go both ways.

The USA tight oil bubble run will not survive past 2026. We need to be exporting our own oil, not shipping it to the USA for them to control exports. 

I am helping develop support for additional pipelines to the northern BC West Coast already.
3786 2018-12-17 17:46:03 Perhaps @CouncillorKeats can correct, but my interpretation of the Leap Manifesto was that it was a group of Federal NDP organizers and insiders that were advocating for an end to Oil & Gas industry. #yyccc. This would equivalent to right councillors expensing a UCP Mtg.
3787 2018-12-17 17:46:01 Yes this is  silica to absorb moisture from the air inside to the reserve tank in order to protect tha oil convert

3789 2018-12-17 17:45:54 Yeah, right. Losing all those regulations and lowering the corporate tax rates had nothing to do with the economic boom.  Or the lifting of Obama's restrictions on drilling had nothing to do with the boom in oil production and natural gas.

3791 2018-12-17 17:45:51 Because of oil we have  a better standard of Living, longer life span, clean water, clean air, A house, a car, schools, and better “MEDICATION”   Denying this standard of living to our children and grandchildren is to send them back into the pass where living was harsh.
3792 2018-12-17 17:45:41 The oil yield is falling.  And domestic demand likely stronger given the removal of tax incentive to import competing vegi oil supplies from Indonesia and Argentina.
3793 2018-12-17 17:45:38 We put 40 billion tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere this year with a 10% increase predicted annually. That means we will double our Carbon footprint in the next decade to 80 billion tonnes. Yet we still tear down the rainforest for palm oil production.
3794 2018-12-17 17:45:24 Check your oil!
3795 2018-12-17 17:45:20 CONGRATULATIONS TO OUR LATEST WINNER OF TRUTH, BARBARA REIDELL! Your

3796 2018-12-17 17:45:17 @XplodingUnicorn me: guys who use starter logs in their fireplaces are cheating. Wife: says the man who uses citronella oil and lighter fluid in his fireplace. Me: *crickets*
3797 2018-12-17 17:45:15 I made them thing olive oil was English... Expensive at the time... Living with idiots
3798 2018-12-17 17:45:14 PURE REAL TRUTH: MEDIUM OIL USING BASEBALL DIAMONDS TO CONTROL INHUMAN DRYAD-WOMAN BURNWILLOW!
3799 2018-12-17 17:45:06 Tip: When you're next at the supermarket get some coconut flour, coconut oil and Almond flour - these are great to have in your cupboard to make Keto friendly breads and cakes!
3800 2018-12-17 17:44:59 @OutnumberedFNC if a Democrat wins the White House he's going to shut down Coal Mine stop oil drilling oil fracking and a whole lot of people are going to be back on welfare and government assistance just because of democrat wins the White House
3801 2018-12-17 17:44:58 watching 24kitchen & some guy just described a lemon juice & olive oil sauce as sexy ok
3802 2018-12-17 17:44:58 the oil industry grew during Obama's presidency DESPITE all the regulations he imposed limiting fracking and exploration.  Another BOLD lie from are dear ex-leader.
3803 2018-12-17 17:44:57 That letter writer thinks oil has poor PR because they are Canadian so humble. More likely from arrogance, I think.
It's not believable when he pushes Krause's line about envi groups having more PR funding.
3804 2018-12-17 17:44:50 Valvoline does oil change on spot lol
3805 2018-12-17 17:44:47 The part that I don’t understand is how a nation the could have energy independence, does not?  From a risk and strategic perspective it’s crazy.  Wars aren’t like they used to be, but oil and energy are strategic commodities to an economy.
3806 2018-12-17 17:44:46 As an Alaskan, the 1989 Exxon Valdez Oil Spill comes to mind. The tourism industry lost over 20,000 jobs. It wiped out sea otters, birds, and any other critter in the path of 11 million gallons of oil.

The Supreme Court reduces fine on Exxon to 500 million - 12 hours of revenue.
3807 2018-12-17 17:44:45 Pake haimask makarizo honey sama pake hair oil semacam extraordinary oilnya l'oreal. Di aku lumayan hasilnya
3808 2018-12-17 17:44:26 What Trump pro American Trump policies & accomplishments do you Trump/America haters not support? Calling Trump a "snake oil salesman" or whatever is irrelevant & only your opinion.Let's talk facts!!!!! 4.2% GDP for a start
3809 2018-12-17 17:44:23 I support ollfield rallies, but I do not support profanity or blatant use of curse words on the signage, it’s what the people AGAINST us will use in their stupid argument against oil.
3810 2018-12-17 17:44:19 Because Halliburton is the nation’s largest oil services company and Mr. Zinke regulates the oil industry on public land, the deal raised questions about conflict of interest.
3811 2018-12-17 17:44:13 A nice landscape oil painting?
3812 2018-12-17 17:44:10 Remember that fuel surcharge added a decade ago. Oil has dropped, will we get that reduced now?
3813 2018-12-17 17:44:02 According to @gmbutts , we don't buy much oil from Saudis.
3814 2018-12-17 17:43:59 Turns out I'd just forgotten to affix the oil cap again after filling up the oil, now everything is out of whack until I can get a new one. Which will hopefully be tomorrow. And it's really not a big deal, thank the old gods and the new!
3815 2018-12-17 17:43:58 That is only true if there is equal access for Canada to export its oil at world prices. Which we don't. Otherwise, MORE dollars go out than come in for the same volume of oil. So, your answer is BS
3816 2018-12-17 17:43:54 Same man you'll come here to  insult yen yen yen
3817 2018-12-17 17:43:33 I tend to agree. You could knock Chiarelli for the move but he went out & got the guy in the first place & it was plain to see that McLellan soured on him. Aberg wasn't given a fair shot at any point in training camp. Still wish Oil had reclaimed him when they had the chance.
3818 2018-12-17 17:43:32 I know husband is proud of me. I’m up on my day off, getting an oil change on my car...instead of waiting for Saturday when he’s off and can take it 
3819 2018-12-17 17:43:30 You misunderstood Piers, at the time they meant to say that Saddam had OIL it was a mistype
3820 2018-12-17 17:43:29 Bill C48, Bill C69, cancel Northern Gateway after Neb approval, killing EE. Then the icing on the cake, buying TMX using our own money to stall & kill that project as well. Trudeau has made no secret his agenda is to shut down the oil sands.
3821 2018-12-17 17:43:29 Lube guy brought us HD 60 hydraulic fluid instead of ISO 60 way oil. They both come in a blue bucket and say 60 on them so they must be the same thing, right?
3822 2018-12-17 17:43:19 I use coconut oil.

3827 2018-12-17 17:42:58 Can you stop peddling bullshit? Governments don't buy oil to make gas, private companies do.

3832 2018-12-17 17:42:29 Gonna go with albacore tuna in water or sardines in oil (especially good when making Italian food)
3833 2018-12-17 17:42:28 Coal is down to 30% of US electricity production from 50% in 2000 and will likely be below 25% by 2020. EV’s get cleaner every day and are about 5 times as efficient converting energy into motion. So yes, burning a bit of coal is cleaner than burning all oil.
3834 2018-12-17 17:42:14 Dear Federal Reserve, US Treasury, CME.
You're not going to be able to fix the economy or stock market by rigging the price of oil lower. No, the only fix is to let gold trade free & let the USD fall much lower. Price controls lead to chaotic price increases @RonPaul @anasalhajji
3835 2018-12-17 17:42:14 Oil prices little changed as bearishness lingers: Crude oil prices were slightly higher Monday… @environmentguru

3839 2018-12-17 17:41:59 i understand the concept. crypto is a different class of commodity because its demand entirely speculative/discretionary for the time being. 

This problem is also exactly why OPEC was created... oil price controls when incentives to oversupply exist.

3844 2018-12-17 17:41:38 Federal/state governments already own offshore oil reserves and have done very little to stop extraction. You don't present any reason to believe nationalizing the actual companies would lead to different results.

This is all about oil and arms sales!! Saudi's not even on the Muslim banned list even after killing 2996 American on 911.

Lots of shit I have bought that is a dud. Research is needed yes. Oil gets solar gets fed money I guess on seed they know farmers will pay

3859 2018-12-17 17:40:30 The moron Gundlach just said, "If I am right.......".  Listening to him, he has never been wrong. What a blowfish. How can anyone stand to invest with this guy and listen to him?  Definitely most annoying guy of 2018.  @cnbc Of course he fits with CNBC overall negative narrative.

Not too big cause they’ll weigh your hair down &not too small either. Moisturize em w/water & castor oil every few days & leave your hair alone. Drink lots of water too
3862 2018-12-17 17:40:25 ?? Oil and prices are very high right now: far higher than three years ago.

3868 2018-12-17 17:40:08 Is the Canadian government as an entity purchasing Saudi oil? Or is it private corporations who import it?

3880 2018-12-17 17:38:58 Let’s rephrase the question.  Would most Americans want action on climate change if it cost them significantly more for gasoline and other products from oil?

3911 2018-12-17 17:36:45 I dont think its deliberate. Through out human history biggest changes have always come from the fringes which are rarely at anyone's horizon. Consider oil itself - how many noticed the shale revolution despite it beginning in 2005, till US became largest oil producer?
3912 2018-12-17 17:36:19 get an oil you can use! thats what i been doing or a good moisturizer!

3928 2018-12-17 17:34:45 But you are aware that CANADA doesn't buy oil from anyone, refining companies do. Perhaps have a word in Mr. Irving's ear if you don't like where he sources his raw materials from.

3930 2018-12-17 17:34:41 As we found out here with NDAP, the damned oil companies don't seem to care a hell of a lot about court orders.  SOMEBODY lets them go right ahead and do whatever the hell they want to.  Obama elected to "let it play out"" and there ya go.
3931 2018-12-17 17:34:33 Dear God, 

Please let them find oil in the North, so they can let the rest of us go and start all over again. They can take all their intolerant Muslims with them.
3932 2018-12-17 17:34:17 So logically the response to boycott by oil industry is what they were going for withthe letter? Maybe stop playing into their hand.

3937 2018-12-17 17:33:41 Hilary lovely, you're completely historically illiterate. The conservative government called the 3 day week in response to the oil shock. Also when property is priced low then mortgages by necessity must be higher. None of this has anything to do with labour policy.
3938 2018-12-17 17:33:35 Just put some pancake dough on the pan, add 3 gallons (that's around 17L, lad) of freshly squeezed linseed oil, stir with a french fry, invade Iraq (again), come back to find the pan bombed and waving an american flag faintly. DONE! :)

I’m not sure there is room for a nut, with the design of these glasses, so I decided to try this rather than take them in to have a screw with a nut put on (which they can do).

3953 2018-12-17 17:32:28 There’s a lot of potential for drugs and treatments to be developed from Cannabis, but as it stands, CBD oil as it’s currently marketed is nothing but an unproven placebo.

This is a very testing period & both interesting & fraught with danger!
3956 2018-12-17 17:31:57 Anybody else put baby oil in there bath water??
3957 2018-12-17 17:31:50 price inflation comes from scarcity of resources versus the demand - the demand for food and oil is relatively stable (economists would say inelastic)
increased wages could result in increased housing costs, but the market would likely respond by building new units
3958 2018-12-17 17:31:39 A quick stir once you buy it and then you can do two things:

1) Store in the refrigerator which will drastically reduce the natural oil separation

2) Make sure the lid is on tight and then you can store it upside down

Enjoy!

I know this is delicate territory to discuss! Meds and treatment, big, big issue, vital to have help, good info.
3963 2018-12-17 17:31:26 So you prefer to buy oil from a place that, if you lived there, you would have to be covered head to toe, walk behind your husband, and not be allowed to drive?

3980 2018-12-17 17:29:32 I have done plenty of my own research, thank you. CBD oil remains an unregulated, impossible to study substance because there’s no standard for its manufacturing. Furthermore most, of not all the studies listed are preliminary and not at all related to pain management.

4007 2018-12-17 17:27:26 4/ A good barometer to watch in oil pricing is the $60bbl mark as Russia's oil based exporting demands $60 to 'survive' $65-70 for the majority of the people to be able to buy enough food, housing & power.

4061 2018-12-17 17:22:58 Also been having anxiety lately and it’s not something I typically struggle with so I take CBD oil drops and I can’t tell you how much that helps!!
4062 2018-12-17 17:22:53 If you still need an oil change, swing by and let us take care of that.  We're open until 6pm. 12186 N Mopac Expy, Austin, TX, US, 78758
4063 2018-12-17 17:22:47 Nadeem have you ever tried CDB oil (cannabis oil) I’m hearing great reports about it from people suffering anxiety & depression, they say they have more energy & sleeping much better I’ve just ordered myself some..Mother Nature gave us everything to survive, it’s worth a try. 
4064 2018-12-17 17:22:42 Oh god hot oil splashed on my thumb. Why is it always my thumbs that get attacked my random things.. this world doesnt want me to play video games
4065 2018-12-17 17:22:35 That’s the ident from the bottom-up cup manufacturers  every bar has Amstel and Heineken on tap for £4 a pint, and a fair few have Neck Oil at £5 or Gamma Ray at £5.50. Cans are a fiver and I’m worryingly excited by a halftime Lupuloid

4070 2018-12-17 17:22:03 Hes a shill for big oil. He is most definitely NOT a progressive.
4071 2018-12-17 17:21:59 Once again, shit happened. Now let’s move forward and find a way to get Alberta oil to tidewater (safely) ASAP.
4072 2018-12-17 17:21:55 I’ve spent YEARS trying to control my skins oil production and now I just want a beautiful GLOW and I feel like a new person.
4073 2018-12-17 17:21:55 EU also want the UK’s North Sea oil reserves, our nuclear arsenal and control of our taxes if we remain members.
We’ll also have to adopt the Euro by 2022.
Because an unelected Council of Ministers thinks these things are a good idea.
4074 2018-12-17 17:21:42 He'll say whatever he thinks makes him look reasonable and then follows the GOP party line.

Snake Oil Bob.

4076 2018-12-17 17:21:30 Indeed. As we all know, only the oil sands production is exempt from supply and demand principles... Right @OilGasCanada? #eyeroll

4078 2018-12-17 17:21:18 I am 24 years old and i have been masturbating for the last 11 years. Recently I started using coconut oil as lubricant during masturbation. Is it safe? Also I would to have oral sex with myself. Is it possible by any yoga position?

4080 2018-12-17 17:21:05 I do recall the USA tossing a few bombs onto Vietnam, Hiroshima and Nagasaki back in the day.  And, yeah, we have been bombing Afghanistan & Iraq for nearly 2 decades on those terrorist efforts plus to allocate their oil rights.  I believe those wars were justified.

4084 2018-12-17 17:20:45 We gave my dog CBD oil because she was getting old and creaky from arthritis.
4085 2018-12-17 17:20:44 And Exxon couldn't get their oil out of Ukraine. 
So many coincidences
4086 2018-12-17 17:20:43 Help! Used the wrong oil stick for a commission and its not drying fast enough! Need solution to speed it up. Have a day max. Anyone?
4087 2018-12-17 17:20:42 1/3 or 33% of earth is coverd in sand, a free resource lying on the surface 2 make glass.

4088 2018-12-17 17:20:32 merry and sunny could be wild horses that they ride. croc’s like, an evil oil tycoon exploiting the land...
4089 2018-12-17 17:20:28 After David Bernhardt is named Acting Dept of the Interior Secretary, we’ll have a former oil lobbyist running DOI, and a former coal lobbyist running EPA.

4090 2018-12-17 17:20:18 Yes but your obviously not getting independence any time soon so why not make things hard for May?

Oh I get it, backhanded agreement with @Conservatives so you can ease austerity while the rest suffer. They don't want your oil. They want your tax receipts!... Whatever.
4091 2018-12-17 17:20:07 No we have an oil rich country feeding off the scraps from a bankrupt country’s table...oil oil oil! Oi Oi Oi! Don’t get all frothy sunshine

4094 2018-12-17 17:19:36 Doesn’t reflect western oil now shipped as far as Montreal where NO Saudi Oil is consumed. He also acknowledges EE is dead. So it does not address the rebuttal to the study that I quoted. You’ll have to do better than this if you want to disprove table you took issue with.
4095 2018-12-17 17:19:34 Fair enough, I'm pretty sure though it's not this OR that.

Regarding earnings growth: do you think it can be expanded further after this tax reduction season? Or you'd point to lower transport costs thus higher margin bc of oil?

What about a possible credit freeze bc of QT?
4096 2018-12-17 17:19:33 Every leader is there to represent his/her own country's interests. You can be diplomatic & forge relationships but your focus must be on what is best for Canada. While I'm here, when are you taking Husky to task for that oil spill? That would be looking after our interests.
4097 2018-12-17 17:19:23 Ur head get oil
4098 2018-12-17 17:19:23 You might have to try stage makeup brands like graftobian or mehron. They use ‘real pigment’ and it doesnt have as much oil or fragrance as regular store brands. Looks like skin too.
4099 2018-12-17 17:19:19 The only real leverage Reagan used to bring Gorby to the table & eventually the fall of the Soviet Union under Bush 1, was oil pricing. The Ruble's value is near 100% oil $$ related. I think it was this exact time of year in 2015 oil went in the tank, dropping to under/near $30!
4100 2018-12-17 17:19:18 I'm wondering if it is related to the sanctions violating by Turkey to buy oil from ISIS & resell it to give ISIS hard cash. I think it explains the assignment of a terrorist prosecutor on Mueller's team.
4101 2018-12-17 17:19:10 kalo aq sesuda bersiin muka pake baby oil
4102 2018-12-17 17:19:08 Potentially the highest man to ever get an oil change
4103 2018-12-17 17:19:01 Geologists claims to fame include spending mass amounts of investors $ to drill for oil based on  prognostication w/significant % of failure & no return on investment (aka "dry holes").

4106 2018-12-17 17:18:50 So Nissan doesn’t have $30 oil changes anymore...my oil change is $50 (which is the cheapest) I’m like don’t y’all make enough damn money?? This is ridiculous!
4107 2018-12-17 17:18:46 Makes sense, I didn't note your late 60s comment, sorry. I was at school late 70 early 80. Oil had been discovered. Mccrone had been written and hidden.
4108 2018-12-17 17:18:38 since you asked .... peel and cut in wedges, mix with oil, paprika and seasoning salt in a pan, put a small baking rack with chicken pieces (SKIN ON) on top of them, roast 45 mins at 400
No better way to eat potatoes than roasted in the fat of an extremely sad feedlot chicken
4109 2018-12-17 17:18:36 Everyone wants that grade-A steak, but I want some grade-A smashed baked potatoes with loads of nooch and avocado lime crema topped with chives and maybe some expensive saffron. truffle oil if I wanna be damn extra.

4110 2018-12-17 17:18:15 Is it in the mechanic code book to try and scare young women into getting unnecessary and expensive work done to their vehicle because they don’t look like they know much about cars? All I want is an oil change, buddy.
4111 2018-12-17 17:18:12 That’s how you know it’s motor oil. Mans dumped that in there so many times only for him not to have ANY on it after he take it out

A star to the right of the 'L'.
4124 2018-12-17 17:17:16 Thank you for stepping up the the #GreenNewDeal! Another action item: steer the DNC honchos away from oil company lapdog Beto. Bad enough they put coal boy Manchin in a prominent position on the environment. Trying to keep up support, but party-line dems are making it difficult.
4125 2018-12-17 17:17:05 i think if ya burned citronella candles and use peppermint  oil soaked  in cotton balls in corners it gets rid or critters  

they hate the smell of citronella Kay hehe
4126 2018-12-17 17:16:55 Quebec’s oil imports come from the US.
4127 2018-12-17 17:16:54 Some of that cannabis smoke must have wafted over to the BNN studio. Joe Schachter calling for $100 oil and $3-4 AECO- but which oil? Is that WTI? Because the Canadian price is something else.

4129 2018-12-17 17:16:13 GM, Firestone and Standard Oil were found guilty of conspiracy in 1949 and paid a ridiculous fine of $5000. They had essentially created a transport monopoly.

Big money wanted oil burners. Also interesting at turn of 19th century 21% of cars in US were electric.
4130 2018-12-17 17:16:05 Today’s tip on personal hygiene: Always wash your hands with soap after dealing with pepper and/or oil
4131 2018-12-17 17:16:01 Just spread olive oil, oregano, rosemary, thyme, garlic and kosher salt on it & u'll basically have the same thing she's eating.
4132 2018-12-17 17:15:48 There’s so many bread sauces but I only know one; it’s olive oil with a few drops of balsamic-vinaigrette, sprinkle in some Italian seasoning and a pinch of sea-salt do enhance the flavor.
4133 2018-12-17 17:15:09 It's better to reduce our oil needs.
4134 2018-12-17 17:15:07 It is really strange and a sign of arrogance when the Venezuelan President Maduro shows off himself seeing his people suffering hunger. He should be ashamed if hasn't  learned a lesson from the failure of leftist politics to administer a country. Venezuela has a lot of oil, but..
4135 2018-12-17 17:15:01 Your racist aunt ain't gon' be able to name your evil twin like Olive Oil will.
4136 2018-12-17 17:14:59 What’s the benefits of lavender oil ?!
4137 2018-12-17 17:14:58 It had oil residue on the underside and poof it lit up after a minute
4138 2018-12-17 17:14:55 What's your idea of "conservative"? 
No more oil industry subsidies or no more Medicaid?
4139 2018-12-17 17:14:55 Though gold is seen by most, 75% or + of the country's markets are more reliant on & their status on the world stage are more affected by oil availabilities, excess/lacking of production & export/import ratio & their populace's  very existence depend on the $$/bbl oil pricing.

4141 2018-12-17 17:14:51 so this foul smelling patchouli+moss oil I have is surprisingly nice to take a bath with. I won't ever make a mistake to put it in a diffuser though
4142 2018-12-17 17:14:51 Ahhhh baba u will still cover ur face soon.
4143 2018-12-17 17:14:15 @Edbrowne11 burnt oil
4144 2018-12-17 17:14:11 I have a company I love but it’s pricey. (Kat’s Naturals) I use the oil. I’ve tried everything and that seems to work best. I’m actually asking for my sister. She asked my advice and I only knew that I trusted the brand I use. But I know very little about it all.
4145 2018-12-17 17:14:07 I’ve been saying that since Obama said in 2010 that USA will be a net exporter of oil. The writing was on the wall then. Not sure why anybody is surprised at the situation.
4146 2018-12-17 17:14:01 It's funny you bring up driving to explain it's a problem we can't fix now. Are there not electric cars being produced on a large scale now? I realize that oil does provide the power to those cars, but it provides substantially more mileage compared to normal consumption.
4147 2018-12-17 17:14:01 In other words, the PCs allowed the cheap sale of oil to USA. They didn't bother to diversify customer base. They screwed up and y'all think more Conservatives in power will end the screwing up? Ha ha ha. @Alberta_UCP So gullible. We had cons at fed level and they screwed up.
4148 2018-12-17 17:13:58 Who the f*** are you Goldfinger? The free market is what caused this debacle in the first place. Stay in your lane snake oil salesmen.
4149 2018-12-17 17:13:57 Line up hot drinks, hydrate, look into cool mist essential oil diffusers & in meantime convert a tart warmer into one, fight.
4150 2018-12-17 17:13:57 I think she wants us to forget what real corruption is: taking payoffs and bribes and breaking the law. THAT'S corruption. But notice @SenWarren doesn't accuse him of any of those things. But I'm sure the #Media will drum something up- despite half the #UN FUNDING the OIl Lobby!!
4151 2018-12-17 17:13:46 I am fighting for the wolves which these assholes want to kill off .I am fighting for Nature and it to stopped being destroyed for greed by developers and oil and all the evil against Nature
4152 2018-12-17 17:13:38 Disappointing v trade ests outside of oil stocks. Market brushing it off tho. Watching the 20EMA for direction been holding on a closing basis since 11/28 & is now acting as support (Fri & today) on the Mar contract.

4154 2018-12-17 17:13:28 Lower oil prices makes Putin desperate.  It’s their primary revenue besides military hardware.
4155 2018-12-17 17:13:21 The last @myvirginkitchen video made me remember something my culinary school teacher told me, someone he knew had gotten loads of hot frying oil on his feet and lower legs and he managed to lessen the damage by jumping into a big tub of potatoes in cold water that stood there.
4156 2018-12-17 17:13:19 Oil leaks still come with the package?

4162 2018-12-17 17:12:22 When he told the world that the United States is in the Middle East to get cheap oil and sell weapons Trump shot himself in the foot. Too many Americans have died there. A family history of dodging the draft and taxes is not going to help either.
4163 2018-12-17 17:12:15 @NissanMotor 
I like Nissan.
Always have.
My Sentra lasted.
Bought 1989
Gave 1997 ran another 10 years until last owner failed to give oil change.
Only reason cars fail is due improper maintenance.

But you keep believing in simple origins for complex problems.

4171 2018-12-17 17:11:44 the business cycle contradicts traditional economics. perhaps a system dynamic model that predicts the business cycle would predict, contrary to intuition, that putting an oil company out of business, by decree, would increase job stability, decrease divisiveness, decrease CO2.
4172 2018-12-17 17:11:43 some nice olive oil then
4173 2018-12-17 17:11:26 if you dont have salonpas white flower oil and tiger balm works well too
4174 2018-12-17 17:11:19 Matérielle ? Logicielle ?
Et on n’en sait rien, on n’a pas accès au code pour vérifier ce que vous dites. On ne va certainement pas vous croire sur parole hein ! Snake oil everywhere.
4175 2018-12-17 17:11:16 Obs oil tankers fault, it had men on it.
4176 2018-12-17 17:11:10 I think so. It can be a v. efficient oil (y/ha). In areas with vulnerable forest, it should be straightforward to not build processing facilities close enough to open forest up. Where factories are already, it's more difficult to control. Big yield differences across space too...
4177 2018-12-17 17:11:09 Eu não sei se gosto mais do Brandon Boyd amargurado cantando coisas tipo Oil and Water ou do Brandon Boyd apaixonado cantando coisas tipo Stellar.

4180 2018-12-17 17:11:04 Oil matters more for global growth (mostly EM) and the lower income deciles in the US

4185 2018-12-17 17:10:43 Hi when I take painting next semester I need someone to buy my paintings because oil paint is EXPENSIVE 
4186 2018-12-17 17:10:41 Bread and Engine Oil
4187 2018-12-17 17:10:29 Enjoy the palm oil.
4188 2018-12-17 17:10:25 What?!?! You mean Quebec is a bunch of hypocrites?!?? I would have never guessed.....Alberta oil is bad but they can dump sewage in water ways and that’s not a big deal.
4189 2018-12-17 17:10:14 Today I learned what happens when you drive for an hour with the oil cap off
4190 2018-12-17 17:10:12 And oil companies. They'll fight good public transport to the hill.
4191 2018-12-17 17:10:09 Plz plz try CBD oil!! @ thoughtcl0ud (on Instagram) the benefits are insane, there's no side effects and it's natural! May not work for everyone but has worked for so many ppl w different illnesses, the reviews speak for themselves!!! I'm finally off meds w my CBD oil 
4192 2018-12-17 17:10:03 カルーアサラダ油とかあったら若い女性に大人気美味しさイナズマ級なのになあ。
4193 2018-12-17 17:10:03 When Trudeau make absolute statement like we can't get a pipeline through Quebec, he is the problem. Clearly we can move rail cars with oil through Quebec. We simply need to develop a working relation between provinces and not a Trudeau dictatorship. @RachelNotley @jkenney
4194 2018-12-17 17:09:53 Currently at Chrysler Getting my Oil Changed
4195 2018-12-17 17:09:49 Now if they wanna be a web page designer, I can see you’re point more forsure. But you wouldn’t go get an oil change and expect the mechanic to tell you to learn how to do it. Unless you wanna work on cars
4196 2018-12-17 17:09:47 Folks are we forgetting how viscous oil is, which is used to slick back the hair of many Italians, ergo pubcat is Italian
4197 2018-12-17 17:09:42 Yes i switched to gamsol recently and its less smelly for sure. I want to try spike lavender oil one day, but it costs a fortune :)
4198 2018-12-17 17:09:41 Or is it just that the guy earned an honest living? He literally worked for an Oil company. That's it. There are a million guys in your office who have done the same thing. Are you willing to fire them now?
4199 2018-12-17 17:09:20 it’s funny how people think the president has ANY pull with oil/gas prices. no relation.
4200 2018-12-17 17:09:10 “We must spend tax money on selling oil!”

“What happens when it doesn’t sell? Doesn’t that just mean we subsidized private industry… again? If we’re going to do that, make it public.”
4201 2018-12-17 17:09:08 I flipping love that oil
4202 2018-12-17 17:09:08 FINALLY! America Ends Their Dependence On Foreign Oil, Addresses Climate Change Better Than #EU
4203 2018-12-17 17:09:06 Josef Schachter back on BNN right now with A Bell.. Even though his previous nat gas top picks like Bellatrix and Bonavista have collapsed in price. This doesn't stop Joe. Says "massive" bull mkt in Cdn oil and gas coming. @AndrewBellBNN
4204 2018-12-17 17:08:54 The war between Saudi and Iran is a war of drugs oil and $ and the American citizen is their victims with phony drug laws and right wing morality
4205 2018-12-17 17:08:53 You do know the goal is to get pipelines so that Alberta oil can be loaded onto tankers and sold to anyone, right?  Today the USA is our only customer, and the goal is to change that.
4206 2018-12-17 17:08:46 Plus it's too expensive - it's alright for Norway, they have a small population and loads in the bank from oil and gas industry - their contribution is a drop in the ocean to them.
4207 2018-12-17 17:08:37 He is against Rojava.
It was him retreated his 18K Pesmerga from Yezidi arae just before ISIS assaults&massacre that to open a corridor to ISIS to invasion of Rojava.

He was selling ISIS oil through Turkey.
ISIS has their equips thru him.
Thanks to YPG that they stopped ISIS
4208 2018-12-17 17:08:27 Every time I come get an oil change the price goes up
4209 2018-12-17 17:08:25 The oil didn’t work out? 
4210 2018-12-17 17:08:17 Do we have oil or not in Mzarabani? Do we have a 1/4 of diamond reserves in Zimbabwe? As a country we haven't invested in geological and mining information systems says @BriggsBomba @cdemlambo @LeninChisaira @GlenDhliwayo #FESZimbabweAlumniAssociation #AnnualYouthConventionZW

4212 2018-12-17 17:07:57 Nice going Benjamin!

My 80 year old mother inlaw is taking cannabis oil for her hip! Never to old to get "HIP"! I am terrified of the other pharma drugs. Hope it works for me. Still really expensive because medical plans do not allow this medicine. Still work to be done on laws.
4213 2018-12-17 17:07:52 What about si? Does it have a perfume oil?
4214 2018-12-17 17:07:51 No. Not let all nature die. I spend much of my days trying to push back against Republicans (and too many Dems)  who are just fine with letting the world die b/c they get $$ from oil companies or worry change won’t be easy and cheap.
4215 2018-12-17 17:07:40 Wheres the report of People,taking to the streets in Grande Prairie to support Canada’s Oil and Gas sector and oppose Trudeau’s divisive policies and carbon tax ?
4216 2018-12-17 17:07:31 Sadly there is no sustainable palm oil, just as there is no cruelty-free meat or egg production. It is correct that food production requires land. The issue under discussion is which land. Do contact POFCAP @PalmOilFreeCert who can help with facts. Best wishes.
4217 2018-12-17 17:07:21 Can i have just the beard activator oil with the 30% discount?

4219 2018-12-17 17:07:11 Oh totally agreed there.  Special teams lost Oil the game last night.  Can't have that happen too often.
4220 2018-12-17 17:07:06 Sprinkle Holy Water, Oil and dip your phone in the Blood of Jesus Christ. If possible get Baptized.

4221 2018-12-17 17:07:02 Hilarious from Farage, someone who is advocating a no deal Brexit which would put the UK at the mercy of trade giants and eaten for breakfast. He is selling us snake oil. Very reckless individual.
4222 2018-12-17 17:06:55 Quebecers per capita use more energy than citizens in China, Germany & almost as much as Americans.
Every year since 2015 they have also bought more SUV & trucks than any other vehicle
Quebec has lot's of appetite for oil & it's only growing.
Make it Canadian.

4231 2018-12-17 17:05:44 Evovld Cartridges are a staff favorite: pure, long lasting bud-only C02 oil and today they're 20% off!
4232 2018-12-17 17:05:38 Yes we buy a huge amount of oil from the US, and yes they have a terrible human rights record. Just check the imprisoned children st their southern border.
4233 2018-12-17 17:05:31 That  is the danger of the kind of economy our government  seem to be comfortable with. Oil and more search for oil. You then ask what happened to diversifying the economy as promised and how far so far?.
4234 2018-12-17 17:05:26 Seen a few studies linking maternal tobacco use during pregnancy.. your mom a smoker too?  wish I had some good advice for ya bro, but sweet oil barely works, smoke blown in to dry it out is bad, regardless of what they used to think.. antibiotics are where it's at pretty much
4235 2018-12-17 17:05:25 Also Milan, you should remove everything in your life that oil and gas is a result of and see what you have left...not much. Once again I’m disappointed that you can betray your fellow Canadians so easily. Maybe Canada in not the country for you
4236 2018-12-17 17:05:25 Olja är bra, bra likviditet i CL terminen då oljan är världens mest viktiga råvara och perfekt att handla. Mer olja och mindre alternativt är drömmen, vi behöver ett nytt #standardoil #oott #oil

4241 2018-12-17 17:05:01 My roommate has been breaking out pretty bad too the last few months & has hated the scars it’s left, she found this vitamin e oil/serum at Walgreens and it’s helped her skin and her scars so much. That might also be something worth looking into :)

4244 2018-12-17 17:04:36 Well flour, oil and sugar are the cheapest sources of energy(calories) in most food systems so...
4245 2018-12-17 17:04:36 I luv using my peppermint oil in my diffuser , it makes my room smell like Christmas
4246 2018-12-17 17:04:29 I couldn't be less interested. Take your snake oil out of my mentions, thanks.
4247 2018-12-17 17:04:16 Maybe he should start by buying Canadian oil and not blood unethical oil from ME
4248 2018-12-17 17:03:45 I bought some CBD oil last night, and as starting from the beginning I added it to water, and since than, and this morning I feel much more calmer.  Haven’t had an anxiety attack yet...

4251 2018-12-17 17:03:28 Okay...following dipshit's logic here, I suppose God rewarded the Arabs with oil for the trans-Saharan slave trade with oil, and the Chinese for the CCP and historical transgressions they did (including the Mongols) with a booming economy? Boy I wish this guy would leave the USA.
4252 2018-12-17 17:03:04 Great advice for spider bites-lavendar oil. Thanks to the lady who gave me the advice and most importantly thanks to Jackie Dickson for the oil. It works!
4253 2018-12-17 17:02:51 Oil is archaic and detrimental to life on Earth.  It is horribly myopic to think this is sustainable.  Make the transition.
4254 2018-12-17 17:02:45 ~~~w. Pure Aniseed Oil~~~
4255 2018-12-17 17:02:42 No you don’t know about the oil sands. If you did you know it’s the most ethnically produced oil in the world, comes from a country with high environmental standards. Men here don’t beat their wives. women work in the patch. what is it that you think you know about the oil sands

4260 2018-12-17 17:01:57 The problem I think is oil. Bloody oil.

The Saudis (high ranking rich) are deceitful, unlawful and inhumane. 

If we could cut ties with them permanently, it would be best but they hold the purse strings so to speak. 

They're a warring nation and that's worrisome.
4261 2018-12-17 17:01:45 -_- I totally meant what oil painting medium, like liquin or just odourless thinner? The paint you are using seems so silky :)

4264 2018-12-17 17:01:33 Thats not what I said at all. I want to take advantage of our oil while we can. But our economy is better off with Canada in the long run. Oil prices might rebound a bit, but the long term trend is down. Electric cars, China slowing down, US oil finds etc.
4265 2018-12-17 17:00:59 Onion Marmalade!

4284 2018-12-17 16:59:29 Aside from the inherent hazards of drilling, especially in deep water, we don't want your oil.  The entire planet is running away from fossil fuels as fast as we can!  Put your resources into developing alternative energy sources and you can join in the profits too.
4285 2018-12-17 16:59:23 Curses! That was a bottle of olive oil!

4287 2018-12-17 16:59:20 Oil sharply lower on global growth concerns again - perilously close to $50 again. Currently down 2% at $50.50 a barrel. Trump hurting the Saudis where it hurts - in the pockets. #Khashoggi #KhashoggiMurder #Oil
4288 2018-12-17 16:59:09 Tax Cuts were written and passed by Congress last time I checked, and the Saudis flooding the market with oil is what has lowered gas prices so rapidly.  It's also costing Americans jobs.

4297 2018-12-17 16:58:03 No one is justifying importing criminals as seeking asylum is a legal process where the applicants are vetted.
Europe has issues because the US & UK destabilized the countries those migrants came from for oil while not accepting responsibility for their actions. Poor equivalence.
4298 2018-12-17 16:58:01 Beard/skin care oil- in a scent that is pleasing
4299 2018-12-17 16:57:50 More because they make no effort to go after foreign producers. You could completely shut down the energy industry in Canada and world oil production and consumption wouldn’t be impacted. The hypocrites i. Quebec wouldn’t reduce their consumption based emissions
4300 2018-12-17 16:57:49 Oil!
4301 2018-12-17 16:57:37 World shows concern over Palestine as well. But nobody sanctions Israel. Same with India. 

Despite being an Islamic country, Pak was not able to alienate India from oil rich countries.

Aggression does not equate to diplomacy.
4302 2018-12-17 16:57:27 Is there anything more boring in life than waiting for an oil change?
4303 2018-12-17 16:57:25 I’m not sure if that’s sarcasm or not. Regardless, I agree with you that it is an economic issue with societal values. I just question societal values when we would rather buy from a murderous regime than our own people. We use oil and will continue. Why not extract it here?
4304 2018-12-17 16:57:22 I don’t like what Saudi Arabia does,but honour the contract.  Stop taking Saudi oil.  Or any other ME Oil & find a way for our whole country to use our own oil.  Build the frickin pipelines & upgrades/refineries.  That’s in our National Interest.

4312 2018-12-17 16:56:20 Well, an oil barrel with third cut off vertically would create a suitable contained and a lid which would condense water. Couple of steel bands to hold the lid or just stone on top of it. A charcoal snake bed where the barrel would be placed would heat it for a rather long time.
4313 2018-12-17 16:56:06 CBD oil is placebo, DO NOT go to a Chiropractor, it’s not science. Stick with ortho and medication for nerve pain such as gabapentin. Unfortunately time is the best medicine here, it can be incredibly frustrating to be immobile and in such pain, but there’s no miracle cure.

4318 2018-12-17 16:55:18 Do you think John Yoo is a war criminal? (The answer is yes). David frum Albert Speer'd himself as the "reasonable smart conservative" but he demonized entire countries and helped sell a war for oil interests that killed thousands
4319 2018-12-17 16:55:14 95% of soybeans are processed for their oil and protein for the animal feed industry.

4321 2018-12-17 16:54:41 Only #NB buys #Saudi oil.
4322 2018-12-17 16:54:33 I will agree that Iran is a waste of finances yet if the Middle East didn't control the US with oil, our country would had eliminated Iran & Iraq a long, long time ago.

4324 2018-12-17 16:54:18 Is the takeaway that we can potentially get a ton of palm oil production and poverty reduction *without* all the deforestation, with some different policy choices? Because if so, i feel like we should try that.

So if you're making a big enough batch could you make just as good pesto in a @Vitamix (minus the oil)?
4340 2018-12-17 16:52:33 Trump has taken the initiative and made the US oil independent. Pretty soon Trudeau will have strangle the oil industry so much in Canada it will be permanently beholden to Saudi Arabia

4348 2018-12-17 16:51:52 I’m at the car dealership getting an oil change and somehow I get into the racial debate with two ladies,one white and one Latinx. Basically I’m glad I had this conversation so they are educated about what others go through.

4350 2018-12-17 16:51:49 Ha ha ha.....you’re a clown. Look up the Scot Gov website. The export thing is a myth and we get all our oil revenues. It’s all there in the Scottish Accounts. I suggest you read them

4427 2018-12-17 16:44:32 @BillHemmer @SandraSmithFox Was prince involved? Most likely. But, did Senate sanctions on Saudi Arabia punish him or WE THE PEOPLE? Here in Maine gas $2.19/gallon and heating oil under $3.00/gallon today. Will those prices skyrocket? BABY IT'S COLD OUTSIDE!

4428 2018-12-17 16:44:31 Your views on oil & gas sound very skewed.  The biggest problem is the legacy & coastal lawsuits as they will line the pockets of the lawyers.  The coastline is not sinking from oil & gas.  It’s the lack of sediments since the river flow was reduced by cor of engineers.
4429 2018-12-17 16:44:31 Do you know anything about the World bank...Central Bank?  Did you know that Libya was starting their own monetary system based on gold which the Central Bank could now allow? The purchase of oil from Libya couldn't be transacted thru the Central Bank.

4439 2018-12-17 16:43:55 Read again. Saudi Arabia had to increase fuel price and devalue their currency due to the crash in oil price. They were not in any form of crises because of their huge reserve and savings balance. Paddy just read so u won't be arguing ignorantly in public.
4440 2018-12-17 16:43:49 It makes me so sick when I contemplate what could have been if Gore had not been cheated. No war in Iraq, or possibly Afghanistan.

4443 2018-12-17 16:43:42 Last week I was told that I only had to pay half of the amount for a heating oil delivery. Today I was told to either pay in full or freeze! I had no choice but to hand over the extra I put aside for Christmas and groceries, just to have heat! Heartless Pricks!!
4444 2018-12-17 16:43:34 The $$$ is Bush related. Oil is but only one portion of that. Open you eyes & your mind. A&M has changed radically over the last 20 years.
4445 2018-12-17 16:43:22 Beto’s campaign donations come from individuals who list their employer when they donate. The maximum donation per individual is $2700. Evidently many of the 300K Texans who work in oil related fields, like my husband, are Democrats.
4446 2018-12-17 16:43:20 @Walmart Just left Walmart, they said they didn’t have time to change my oil and compressor was down to rotate tires. Glad u don’t need the business.
4447 2018-12-17 16:43:20 Never took it as anythig other than a convo  As far as Hitch's comments go, I've been preaching the trying to do too much angle for yrs but most still prefer to talk about effort, which is a shame.
4448 2018-12-17 16:43:13 If you work in the oil and gas industry, stainless steel nameplates are the perfect choice to withstand the harsh environment.
4449 2018-12-17 16:42:54 The guy who changed my oil made fun of me to my face for having a whole bunch of Dunkin Donuts bags in my passenger footwell.

Still gonna go back in six months because their rates are good, so that's all you need to know about me.
4450 2018-12-17 16:42:49 * Oil market correcting, everyone expected to cut output -
UAE
 * Oil production cuts may not balance the market, say
investors
 * Slowing economic growth in China, Europe drags on oil

Let’s see the break of 50!
4451 2018-12-17 16:42:47 You’ll get your paperwork. Government doesn’t move quick enough. Snails pace. Stay on them. The squeaky wheel always gets the most oil. 
4452 2018-12-17 16:42:38 @GIGMotors the captain requested to pick oil in Benin city which we obliged to. Now your team after several calls did not prepare whatever was needed to pick up. Delaying us an extra 30mins.

4454 2018-12-17 16:42:15 It violently threw a rod, punched out the block, and caught fire because oil and hot headers don’t mix.
4455 2018-12-17 16:42:14 OIL IS  ALL CAPS DAPAT
4456 2018-12-17 16:42:13 McDonnell has comments that concern me over the direction a Labour Leadership would take over the oil and gas industry, but I'm optimistic. 

Good precedential idea for the COP, but higher standards should follow subsequently as the deadline for obtainable reversibility nears.
4457 2018-12-17 16:42:10 And how exactly can we ship more through the US outside of confederation? What isn't available now? And we aren't blockaded. We have extremely free trade with ROC. We're getting unfairly blocked w.r.t. pipelines by BC and QC and that's it. Also, an oil economy isn't sustainable.

4466 2018-12-17 16:41:00 Khamenei's apparent intervention in budget process:

Gov't must spend more on those hit by inflation/cost of living changes

4471 2018-12-17 16:40:36 Best way to cure a cold without using Albas Oil or Vapour rub ?.. I'm allergic to both & at the moment I'm really struggling.. 
4472 2018-12-17 16:40:27 Canada is a great place and has wonderful healthcare.

I do not think many people in #Alberta are thinking about quitting their job. 
The lack of pipelines and low oil price are making many in the oil patch concerned about losing their job.
#abpoli #onpoli #cdnpoli
4473 2018-12-17 16:40:26 You could try roasting the cauliflower. Cut into florets, put onto baking tray, drizzle with a smidgen of oil, season with black or cayenne pepper, roast for approx 15 mins at 180C. Delicious.

4475 2018-12-17 16:40:21 Let me help! 
1) No subsidy once crude oil price is below $60/bbl.
2) 145/l was based on worst case scenario of $60/bbl. @NNPCgroup makes money.
3) Under-recovery (subsidy) by NNPC once crude oil price is above $60/bbl - #NNPC loses money.
The policy is called #PriceModulation.

4477 2018-12-17 16:40:02 I agree. I much prefer the clean cut, wavy haired Aquaman. The other guy looks like he might smell of fish and boat motor oil.
4478 2018-12-17 16:40:01 Ocean pollution here! Did you know that not all sources of contamination in the ocean come from just oil, trash and solid wastes. The dumping of radioactive waste from nuclear reactors, industrial race and drained sewage are also heavy contributors to pollution.
4479 2018-12-17 16:39:51 Hair stylist: “Your hair is so coarse! D: *rubbing oil into it* You would have so much less frizz if you’d moisturize.”

Me,trying not to scrunch my nose, thinking: “I would if so many of them didn’t smell like fake fruit.”
4480 2018-12-17 16:39:49 Saute in butter or oil until soft and use as a complement to salmon or chicken. This could also be a pasta sauce in the manner of bigoli in salsa. Or gratinate them, since they’re such big ‘uns.
4481 2018-12-17 16:39:38 In my opinion China is not interested in Western route when it hss available alternate  route; straight road from Gwader to D.I Khan & onwards can be built w/o contacting any population centre of Pskistan. Here a oil pipeline & railway line can be made in parallel conveniently.
4482 2018-12-17 16:39:29 Quebec is well equipped with refineries owned and operated by Suncor, a Canadian company heavily invested in oil sands, and it is supplying Quebec and other parts of Canada with refined products. Enough twists and lies!
4483 2018-12-17 16:39:15 If conservatism worked that shit wouldn't be necessary.  Not my fault you can admit your selling snake oil.

4487 2018-12-17 16:38:58 Started some baking but now I’ve to back to store for oil!!
4488 2018-12-17 16:38:56 Sadly the world now is all about personal interests - the diamond, the gold, the oil, the platinium etc...sadly our own greedy leaders are also facilitating to the loots...
4489 2018-12-17 16:38:53 Either reading or tweeting his mother, thanking her for the squirrel oil.
4490 2018-12-17 16:38:42 Get in touch with the oil companies, the PM does not buy the oil.

4492 2018-12-17 16:38:11 Lavender essential oil works wonders
4493 2018-12-17 16:38:02 Funny enough, when I was checked for migraine issues, they suggested drinking coffee to alleviate symptoms. Just yesterday, it worked perfectly. Caffeine & peppermint oil usually knocks it out!

4495 2018-12-17 16:37:58 I’m reading in the replies that the substance is oil?  I hope so. Looks like furniture varnish to me and that would definitely really ruin a car’s finish...
4496 2018-12-17 16:37:55 Any recipe that notes country of origin for the olive oil can fuck right off.
4497 2018-12-17 16:37:49 so many people here gave wonderful detail, advice and were articulate in expressing their love for your creations so I'm just gonna real quick boil my reasons down into an essential oil: I Am Gay
4498 2018-12-17 16:37:42 Nope, that's a lie. I doorknocked for the NDP in 2015. Our elected candidate supported TMX & O&G, our messaging on the doors supported pipelines & the oil sands sector, & that tone has been consistent since the election. Not your fault if you've just started paying attention now.
4499 2018-12-17 16:37:31 たまらねぇなぁ＾～( ՞ةڼ◔ )
4500 2018-12-17 16:37:28 Ok. Btw why aren't USA an OPEC member? They're the biggest oil producer.
4501 2018-12-17 16:37:24 That is wild that oil from Kazakhstan made it all they here.

4503 2018-12-17 16:37:15 Sirota RTed a list of the biggest recipients of $$ from "the oil/gas industry", & Beto was 2nd w abt 400K. Except that $$ was actually from *employees* of oil $ gas: like drivers, secretaries...Act Blue donations. Purposely made to look like PAC $$. Dirty trick, not kosher.

4505 2018-12-17 16:37:01 A carbon tax doesn't erase the fact that we use huge amounts of natural gas to make steam to extract bitumen. We use even more energy to ship and upgrade, and again more energy to refine the oil. 

It would be better to skip the construction of upgraders and go right to renewable
4506 2018-12-17 16:36:59 Didnt he take some kind of bribe money from frackers and oil people for opening up the bears ears monument. ?
4507 2018-12-17 16:36:57 So that was usually when school was out for Summer & since no friends had a pool, I’d cover myself in baby oil & lay out on tin foil on the roof (I was 13 & more privacy bc no one had fences) of our house w the water hose.  I shudder now but I had a great tan then.

4516 2018-12-17 16:36:10 You’ve got to use a carrier oil, boo. Coconut, cocoa butter, jojoba, and even olive oil can work. If not it’s way too heavy and can wreck your skin.
4517 2018-12-17 16:36:08 just a reminder that even tho Zinke’s out doesn’t mean our environmental protections are safe. his likely predecessors will be just like him: oil lobbyists who have a disdain for renewable energy and will do anything to lessen wildlife protections in order to make more money.
4518 2018-12-17 16:36:03 I'm having trouble deciding. Balsamic Can Finally Spot Gaslighting? Oil and Vinegar Immune to "But FAAAAAMILY"? Roasted Red Pepper Has Opinions and Boundaries? (If I could still eat dairy, I feel like Creamy Peppercorn Queer would be a strong contender.)
4519 2018-12-17 16:36:01 Did your dad teach you to change the oil in your car or repair drywall? My guess is no.
4520 2018-12-17 16:35:55 Must be nice. Coconut oil breaks my skin out. 
4521 2018-12-17 16:35:51 Hmmm...but that's the go to whine from Albertans, isn't it? Buying a pipeline in an effort to facilitate its twinning doesn't move oil so doesn't count. A global supply glut, plummeting prices, and Appeals Court rulings have nothing to do with the issue. Got it.
4522 2018-12-17 16:35:46 Non mais ouvrir la page wikipédia sur Snake Oil et lire des articles d'experts sur le sujet, c'est compliqué aussi…

4531 2018-12-17 16:35:00 After reading I am wondering if it's natural for US to help US companies.  2015 Federal Government fought against lawsuit to big oil.
4532 2018-12-17 16:34:50 And it seems to me that the oil embargo was put on by OPEC to punish the US for giving military assistance to Israel before Carter even took office. Nixon approved the aid. And yet Carter gets blamed. Do I have that wrong ?
4533 2018-12-17 16:34:45 One thing I find interesting about the ethanol argument is all the byproducts people don't know about. Some of our corn goes to ethanol plants...Which also produce inexpensive pet & livestock feed, road "de-icer," ALCOHOL, dry ice, oil, plastic, algae... It's more than just fuel!
4534 2018-12-17 16:34:42 Here's what I mean- from "Deep Water Drilling Rises From the Depths" Bloomberg @BW June 25th Issue- "In the Permian, a top-performing well produces about 2,000 barrels of oil daily for a few weeks before declining sharply."
4535 2018-12-17 16:34:40 Yeah, I made my own compression shirt for mine, I believe they have cheaper versions but like you said they don’t work well. Good luck with the CBD oil.  Keep us posted.
4536 2018-12-17 16:34:10 If your car insurance was mandated to cover an annual safety inspection, tires, wipers, oil changes, coolant flushes, brakes, mufflers, etc. and you were forced to use insurance approved services and garages, you wouldn't be able to afford the insurance.
4537 2018-12-17 16:34:08 Is Trump removing regulations to bolster US energy production and pressing OPEC to lower oil prices to pay back Putin for his help in the election?

BABY IT'S COLD OUTSIDE!

4542 2018-12-17 16:33:39 Try considering oil and gas produced elsewhere in the world and the implications that has. Progress simply means change which we’d all agree with, in this case over several decades, and wtih the support of a strong Canadian energy sector.

4560 2018-12-17 16:30:56 We can find other ways to make those.  We used to make plastic bottles from oil products.  Now almost all bottles are made from some percentage of plant materials.  We don't have to drive less, we just need to change the power sources for our cars.  Etc.

4570 2018-12-17 16:29:24 Look.  I know climate change is real and oil is finite.   We import 10m$ of Saudi oil PER DAY.  Solution: reduce demand through innovation.  Fund innovation w oil in meantime.   Stop importing.  Transport by pipeline, the safest way possible.  = better future.
4571 2018-12-17 16:29:16 Hiya. You can either order from us and have it delivered or pick up some jars at @Theshopaccra1 or Mejub Mart (Frumps Oil, Manet Court junction - Spintex).
4572 2018-12-17 16:28:43 Be consistent. You accuse people of being anti-obi because of tribalism. That is a false accusation on you part. Correct that first. There is no opium. It does NOT make sense to follow PDP with their past record. FG under PDP was borrowing to pay sal when oil was >$60
4573 2018-12-17 16:28:41 bro.. i burned my face w tea tree oil omg
4574 2018-12-17 16:28:38 While you deny US companies log, mine & extract oil, making Central American communities uninhabitable, on top of our govt. overthrowing elected C.A. govts. & installing those friendly to our commerce, causing instability. you don't "love/appreciate" the US You're ashamed of it.
4575 2018-12-17 16:28:37 Oil daal kr heart attack toh de hi denge 
4576 2018-12-17 16:28:37 LMFAOOOOooooooo... These ones are actually still fair, at least it is oil that is washable with just soap. Mine was a pain in the chest. 
4577 2018-12-17 16:28:34 yeah
i started doing tha tnow
but LUL i did use most my oil not doing it hue
4578 2018-12-17 16:28:24 Great news yet again... BUT, need this refinance sorted. The shareprice should be performing much better than this. Shareholders feel like they're being screwed for a second time. Lost many thousands with the morrfew fiasco, rather not lose a second time.
4579 2018-12-17 16:28:23 If I offer you $25 off CBD Oil.
Would you try it?
yes or no
Still a few gift cards left
4580 2018-12-17 16:27:57 Big Oil getting so angry at your #ethanol coverage of the RINs and waiver deal that you need to wear a Kevlar vest and a helmet???
4581 2018-12-17 16:27:55 Covered in snake oil.
4582 2018-12-17 16:27:53 tea tree oil heal me
4583 2018-12-17 16:27:31 This one is similar to my recipe, only I use almond oil mostly, I also add a Tbs. of dried flowers, hibiscus, chamomile or lavender are my faves. I tend to skip coloring, but will use colorful micas sometimes.
4584 2018-12-17 16:27:18 calves - smooth
coconut oil - lathered on 
me: gay
4585 2018-12-17 16:27:13 If I offer you $25 off CBD Oil.
Would you try it?

Still a few gift cards left!
4586 2018-12-17 16:27:01 it tkaes like 1200 oil and well 
wopsie dopsie i made a opsie
4587 2018-12-17 16:27:00 Someone just made +7.87% on WCX: buy WTI Crude Oil 50.549 → 50.748 (20x leverage)  ~ CUTE $WTICO $USD
4588 2018-12-17 16:26:52 Frankly the country is more in need of women pushing birth control rather than banaspati oil!!
4589 2018-12-17 16:26:49 My main concern with it is that CBD works with CB1 & CB2 receptors. There are no live CB1 & 2 receptors in the hair shaft since it is all dead skin cells. So it's a waste for how expensive it is. I really like castor oil, it's really thick so I mix it with coconut oil.
4590 2018-12-17 16:26:42 Aww, poor Baylee.  I had a dog that was terrified of storms, fireworks, anything really loud or fast. In the beginning they gave me medicine to help her cope, later I found out about CBD oil, it really helped her, she was able to live a comfortable life. Hope she is better.
4591 2018-12-17 16:26:40 So I guess if you learned that Quebec doesn't import a drop of oil from Saudi Arabia you would instantly apologize to the people of Quebec and tell @jkenney he's full of it

4593 2018-12-17 16:26:31 Hemp. We can make plastic that dissolves withing 24 hours of touching salt water made from HEMP. Instead of oil like it is now. We are all lazy. Everyone one of us. not just me and Bucko over there.
4594 2018-12-17 16:26:27 Thank you to everyone who has ever been read accidentally or on purpose  ..guided .. listened to me n to ppl who have purchased an oil from me shared/retweeted/re-grammed anything of mine(is that even a word lol ) it means the world to me! I support those who support me!
4595 2018-12-17 16:26:24 Because he thinks Alberta oil is dirty.... oh wait no it’s because he doesn’t want to enrich a western province or any province other than Quebec. Oh and I almost forgot.... it’s because he is a coward.
4596 2018-12-17 16:26:24 hey thank you! where would I be able to find that, you think they have it at like a walmart or cvs? i’m gonna try cleaning it twice a day again, like when I first got it and see if that helps but if it doesn’t i’ll try the oil!
4597 2018-12-17 16:26:19 Ah. I played so little that the commission often didnt even cut deep enough to allow me to pick up oil from the canteen
4598 2018-12-17 16:26:13 $OIL $USO down over 1% and energy names are mostly green $XLE. I can't remember the last time I've seen that. Need to see this kind of positive divergence if energy names are going to put in a bottom - they have been absolutely decapitated
4599 2018-12-17 16:26:10 Yeah unbelievable, we warned people. Now with the massive damage shes done she finally is out of her dilusional world and in reality. Notley is a #joke thanks for ruining Alberta by being stupid and helping foreign oil....
4600 2018-12-17 16:26:09 Uahsauheise socorro. Imaginei oil x acquaman, onde o oilman está com a gangue dos vovôs oleosos dele dando bicicletada na cabeça do acqua.
4601 2018-12-17 16:26:07 research would still get funded. what do you think oil companies do.
4602 2018-12-17 16:26:06 ใครอ่า
4603 2018-12-17 16:26:05 I found literally eating with them helpful. I made popcorn in a pot (just coconut oil and pure corn kernels) for my birds and I to share and they loved breaking the pieces I placed near them lol. My birds bonded with me the most over food!
4604 2018-12-17 16:26:05 CONGRESS HAS CHANGED . Remember Natwar Singh of 'oil for food fame' ? He was a senior member but wasn't spared. 
 Congress i feel is zero tolerant party. You won't find them rabble rousing.
4605 2018-12-17 16:25:51 You ain’t said nothing slick to a can of oil King 
4606 2018-12-17 16:25:41 Lol buy yourself a scan tool, change your own spark plugs & oil. Change oil filter then scan your car with scan tool and erase erasable codes. So satisfying
4607 2018-12-17 16:25:26 There is nothing "natural" about West's
- catching fish in Norway, shipping it to China for processing, and then back West for sale.
- taking Peruvian population's quinoa, for West's fad/higher prices.
- bulldozing Cambodians out of their villages for palm oil/West's junk food.
4608 2018-12-17 16:25:26 if your bump doesn’t go away try tea tree oil! i had one on my nose for so long and it was super gross but i tried tea tree oil and it was gone within two days
4609 2018-12-17 16:25:24 Prime a light grey, add nuln oil, dry brush white
4610 2018-12-17 16:25:12 if you think Biden can win once my compatriots decide to remind the (underpolled) youths of his pre-Diamond Joe record, then I've got some snake oil that should make your face normal for the first time. Only 500$
4611 2018-12-17 16:24:48 @WinterbleShow cont... give them a license to kill illegal aliens. Stop borrowing money to give to other countries. Take raparations from Irag, Kuwait, and Afghanistan . One barrel of oil for every dollar spent. Stop wasting money on trying to throw the POTUS out....cont...
4612 2018-12-17 16:24:39 Un an après avoir commencé Naruto,  aujourd’hui le 17/12 je viens de regarder le dernier épisode ptn j’ai envie de pleurer
4613 2018-12-17 16:24:39 I’m curious in what world sending missiles to Ukraine, crippling Russia’s economy with US energy exports, ending the deal that constrained Iranian oil production, all while forcing up NATO spending, is licking Putin’s taint but I’d love to be enlightened here
4614 2018-12-17 16:24:37 Saw a picture of the “new guy”, geez! I get the sense that if he gets a paper cut, he bleeds crude oil and substance that is a combination of bile & cheap bourbon.
4615 2018-12-17 16:24:18 tea tree oil, coconut oil, aloe vera
4616 2018-12-17 16:24:15 Looks like used oil? 
4617 2018-12-17 16:24:08 1) Because Trump supports America's domestic oil production.
2) That leads to cheaper oil world wide.
3) Which leads to less profit from Russia's oil pipeline.
4) errr…  bot is thinking...  please wait... <reboot>
5) Trump bad man.  Make people cry.
4618 2018-12-17 16:23:57 So let’s get this straight, McDavid should just lead this category because why?  Because he’s McDavid???  Sound Oil fan logic.
4619 2018-12-17 16:23:49 I like serums for that. I mostly use Fresh's Seaberry Moisturizing face oil alone or added to face moisturizers, and Josie Maran Pure Argan oil.
4620 2018-12-17 16:23:47 @GNSensay Hi, @aeberman12 suggested that you may share an optimum manner in trading Canadian oil (other than trading their oil equities). I don't know of the existence of canadian oil futures unless they are otc. What should I look into?
4621 2018-12-17 16:23:42 I'm coming withy massage oil.
4622 2018-12-17 16:23:36 And now, under the Trump admin, expansion of oil & gas production on our public lands will increase these emissions. Once again, Trump is endangering public health by cowtowing to OG interests.
4623 2018-12-17 16:23:32 Ask me when I need a new oil change and I’ll say ask my daddy 
4624 2018-12-17 16:23:28 Engine oil,make sure you bleach it well 
4625 2018-12-17 16:23:17 Alberta cannot sell its oil for the prices on the world market due to limited pipine capacity and lack of access to markets via tidewater. Americans are buying AB crude on the cheap and exporting US/AB oil at market value. Were you aware of this?
4626 2018-12-17 16:23:15 It is not just Deputy Secretary that Zinke is leaving behind that worries me, but machinations he set in motion continuing, like NRA appointments, oil & gas leases, removal of institutional knowledge & employees "not loyal" to @realDonaldTrump or Zinke, removal/hiding of science.
4627 2018-12-17 16:23:14 If you read the tweet, it's very clear. QC imports no Saud oil. Anyone who buys refined fuel from NB does but then suddenly the narrative changes from "QC should stop buying Saud oil and buy AB oil" to "NB should stop buying Saud oil and selling to the Maritimes, QC etc"
4628 2018-12-17 16:23:05 Snake oil salesman.
4629 2018-12-17 16:23:03 Add one more possibility. Who owns the tankers bringing Saudi oil?
4630 2018-12-17 16:23:01 Why not take meaningful change like passing legislation to require oil/coal power plants to transition to lng which produces 50% less co2. How about partnering with hydro electric producers to expand hydro power. Or tax incentives to install solar on buildings?
4631 2018-12-17 16:22:54 Last night I was almost crying cause I couldn’t sleep from extreme low back pain. I dropped some cbd oil under my tongue & 10 mins later it felt better and I fell asleep. Shits a miracle I swear
4632 2018-12-17 16:22:45 C’est bien tout le problème. Je cherche à comprendre, et plus je creuse, moins je comprend. Et plus ça ressemble fortement à de la snake oil…
4633 2018-12-17 16:22:41 Cold weather tip of the day for you.
Struggle with your car door being frozen shut in winter?
Rub the door rubber with WD40 or a little cooking oil to stop it sticking.
You're welcome.
4634 2018-12-17 16:22:30 Neither you, any other politician, or any constituents understands what insurance really is and what it's really for, which is why you (plural) have collectively renamed it "healthcare". Does car insurance cover oil changes and tire rotations? Nope, it sure doesnt.
4635 2018-12-17 16:22:27 OiLさんはそんな人じゃないと信じてますよЩ (＾ω＾)Щ
4636 2018-12-17 16:22:21 Lol bro it ain’t no oil in the pipe
4637 2018-12-17 16:22:18 I've grown really fond of oil pastels, i need to chill out on the pressure I put on them though I broke my two favorite colors... I've just now realized how much money I'm going to put into art and how valuable artwork truly is. Endless hours of effort and art supplies. Wow
4638 2018-12-17 16:22:15 How about an energy bill of rights where we must move oil and natural gas across the country so we can use what we have instead of importing more expensive oil from overseas that powers the various modes of transportation that this bill protects.
4639 2018-12-17 16:22:12 Oh, and the oil price?
4640 2018-12-17 16:22:08 running out of oil is something never happened to me, you always run full 6 gal fleet`?
4641 2018-12-17 16:22:05 Regular car service is such a major scam. These buggers just change oil and spark plugs and give you your car back without checking if there may be anything needing attention. 

Warning lights galore, three weeks after a “service”. 

The ANC is failing us.
4642 2018-12-17 16:22:01 No problem giving them millions for their Oil
4643 2018-12-17 16:21:57 "Mmmm, is that notes of motor oil I detect?"
4644 2018-12-17 16:21:48 Bacon Grease is my Essential Oil.
4645 2018-12-17 16:21:46 put cannabis oil on my bruise. it better work
4646 2018-12-17 16:21:42 Effective naman pala yung castor oil 
4647 2018-12-17 16:21:39 @GMillerTSN there might be little oil left in Andi’s car 
4648 2018-12-17 16:21:38 It’s pretty much the same sebab cleansing balm bila dia emulsify dia jadi oil jugak :)
4649 2018-12-17 16:21:38 When I moved out w/ my brother he made me change the oil in his cars, change my own tire & help him remove the steering column & more shit. Even tho I complained about 50% of the time I was there I really appreciate that learning experience doing shit with your hands is fun asf
4650 2018-12-17 16:21:27 @AlexOnAutos Hi! Would you please do an update on the Civic turbo once the 2019 EX (turbo) comes out since your last was made in 2016? Also, would you find out if they'd fixed the oil dilution issue as they promised for the 2019 models?
4651 2018-12-17 16:21:10 Ah non, au contraire, vous faites clairement plus de communication que de sécurité. C’est même tout le concept de snake oil 
4652 2018-12-17 16:21:09 IS the CBD oil 100% THC FREE?
4653 2018-12-17 16:21:08 You know there’s hundreds of places you can go to get it done. I’m speaking on your boyfriends behalf GET YOUR FUCKING OIL CHANGED
4654 2018-12-17 16:21:05 Leaking oil and vibrating like crazy - new from Bad Dragon
4655 2018-12-17 16:21:00  It's oil pastels haha I can send u a sneak peek in private 
4656 2018-12-17 16:20:51 I drive 2 hours frequently and I still only need two oil changes a year at like $55 
4657 2018-12-17 16:20:48 Get on the oil Val
4658 2018-12-17 16:20:42 So we are to believe that without a peep in the Congressional Record ,the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA is part of the ACA) was repealed because of replacement of a tax level - must think BPCIA is a conspiracy between an oil co #and intelligence agency
4659 2018-12-17 16:20:34 I'd rather support a club with a rich and successful history than one who has been living off of Arab oil money and was an unknown team 15 years ago. Just accept the fact that you're a small club. The Big English clubs are Liverpool, Man United, Chelsea, Arsenal, Aston Villa.
4660 2018-12-17 16:20:19 Go get some oil, I don’t want your car to catch on fire.
4661 2018-12-17 16:20:19 I am not happy about it but oil is bought by public companies not the QC government. Transfer payments go direct to QC government as revenue.  Your statement is incorrect in fact
4662 2018-12-17 16:19:57 There are like 12 scientist most of whom aren't climate scientist n r paid by oil n gas handsomely
4663 2018-12-17 16:19:57 • Bio-oil is supposed to be reallt good. I’ve never used it, but apparently it works wonders. 

• Aloe Vera! It helps to regenerate skin tissue and and has “miraculous skin healinf properties”! 

• Use tropical creams like coconut oil! It reallt helps

4666 2018-12-17 16:19:41 Yes, unless @LandRover offer goodwill, I'll be asking you guys to do the oil and filter change for me. 
4667 2018-12-17 16:19:38 Ladies don't tell me you dont have time for an oil change I just got one in less than 20 minutes.
4668 2018-12-17 16:19:38 Sure. You can buy & sell Canadian oil. I have never done it but ask someone like @GNSensay
4669 2018-12-17 16:19:32 @Trevor_Cripe I tried to go get my oil changed and it was a 5 hour wait... hope ur proud that I at least tried to go lol
4670 2018-12-17 16:19:26 writing a bunch of checks on oil futures was a bad gamble... until it all flips in 8 days.

4680 2018-12-17 16:18:54 @GordonRamsay Best marinade. Montreal steak season, season salt,pepperoncini juice and two peppers,minced garlic,fresh basil paste,fresh cilantro paste,olive oil and blue plate mayonnaise. Pork tenderloin and chicken leg quarters are best so far. Name Uncle DICK’s Big Marinade!

4683 2018-12-17 16:18:40 What happens when you factor in TOI? I’ll bet he slides even further down. It’s a complete joke, but if an Oilers fan says anything about it they’re just whining. Last nights reffing was particularly atrocious. Oil didn’t deserve to win anyways, but wow.
4684 2018-12-17 16:18:35 They are going on well. We have just acquired cheap chickens for $8 from a guy and we will go to Rolling Ribbs butchery where beef $6/kg. Veges are going on at $20 from @FreshInABox  plus we can get @RoilCooking oil at $6 from stores. So far so good! UDecember to #Destronger
4685 2018-12-17 16:18:28 Bounce into Fed meeting? Please!?!? Before we washout on lower lows! Would LOVE a big bounce to short into next few days. Keep an eye on interest rates and oil to lesser extent. So far they are saying bear bounce at best. $SPX $QQQ $SPY

4687 2018-12-17 16:18:12 Many people who find Coconut and Olive oil doesn't work with their skin have better success with things like Lanolin that more closely matches the oils our skin produces
4688 2018-12-17 16:18:08 The only thing more annoying about waiting to get an oil change is the people you have to wait around...SHUT UP
4689 2018-12-17 16:18:01 @FairQuestions Trudeau will force AB/Sask to have the largest protected areas in the world to protect a few thousand Caribou. The “unintended” side effects will be to kill the oil and gas industry in AB and the uranium industry in Sask.  The attack on the west has many prongs.

4692 2018-12-17 16:17:32 Nice!! 4 weeks a too long for me, LOL!! I'm sticking to just adding lemon & lime juice to my mixture (with a touch of tea tree oil for good measure). Considering taking these ingredients and boiling them with a bit of baking soda in it as well. I'll have to tweet when I try that
4693 2018-12-17 16:17:20 I think you're confusing 'impartial' with 'credible'. It's possible to be credible and truthful while having definite opinions, and impartial can mean giving undue credence to a side which is pure snake oil.
4694 2018-12-17 16:17:18 Shaving with coconut oil is way better than shaving cream. It’s just as smooth as a wax.
4695 2018-12-17 16:17:09 How to get rid of stretch marks: 

• Tea Tree oil is a really good remedy for stretch marks. My friend has used it and she said it really helps! 

• Kelo-cote. A person I know has used this for scars she has and it really reduces the visibility. 
4696 2018-12-17 16:17:09 It’s gunna sound weird but warm olive oil in the ears helps

4699 2018-12-17 16:17:03 Confused, I thought that the reason we have massive coal seams was that there was no fungus to break down lignin in the Carboniferous so the trees were not recycled by it and hence the carbon was drawn out of the atmosphere and stored as coal/oil leaving a lower CO2 atmosphere
4700 2018-12-17 16:17:03 Boats generally burn diesel which is even worse for the environment or Marine Gas Oil which is approximately the same as Jet Fuel.

4703 2018-12-17 16:16:53 They ban fracking in the province of Quebec but will gladly buy fracked oil from the US. Reminds me of Canada's restriction on selling your blood but our hospitals import blood from the US that was collected using that very method.  #canpoli
4704 2018-12-17 16:16:51 Fun holiday cake hacks. No. 3.
It is all about substitutions. 
- pudding mix to match
- keep oil
- add more eggs
- milk in lieu of water
big change in this approach you will mix pudding, eggs (beating), then oil as a mixture to then add cake mix plus 1/3 cup flour. Smoother batr.

4710 2018-12-17 16:16:15 That's a good question. Why the hell is it? We can live without palm oil in everything but orangutangs can't live without their homes. Manufacturers need to make more effort to phase it out of their products.

4751 2018-12-17 16:11:26 No support for oil in Quebec. Start by banning asphalt, anything plastic, all non-electric cars, even those crossing its borders. Only allow electric heating and all-electric construction work. If they're not lying, they could start today.

4754 2018-12-17 16:11:08 I have managed to cut out just about all palm oil from my diet.. Eating locally, and no processed foods and buying handmade soaps/beauty products makes all the difference. Otherwise, it is indeed almost impossible to achieve zero palm oil consumption.

Great to see you in the conversation for Cdn energy. 

QC buys most of its oil and its gas from the United States at much higher prices than Canada sells it to the US purely for political reasons. As you know they have their own gas. 

Other provinces buy Saudi not QC.

4773 2018-12-17 16:09:21 Saudi oil goes to Irving refineries in New Brunswick, not up the St. Lawrence and likely ends up in Quebec as well as all Atlantic Canada, where all (other than Nfld.) have higher per capita equalization share than Quebec (No. 6 per capita). Facts matter.

2. they attacked first nations every chance they could.
4779 2018-12-17 16:08:29 You have yet to answer the most basic question. Is it better to get oil from Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, and Russia to satisfy the oil needs of east Canada or to get the oil from Canada?

4790 2018-12-17 16:07:23 Historically our economy benefited from lower oil translating to lower fuel costs for consumers and cost of goods sold for industry. Now that we are a major producer much of our employment is leveraged to energy produciton offsetting the cost benefit.

4801 2018-12-17 16:06:12 1. cheaper oil stimulus never happened in 2016, when it wouldve been more potent

4833 2018-12-17 16:01:15 Growing up in a politically divided household in times like annoying yf...can't even ask where the cooking oil deh without hearing ask petrojam
4834 2018-12-17 16:01:13 I hope you get to learn one day. My maternal great grandmother told us all we came from Padre Balli, she had his last name, & was raised by his family. When his brother’s family sued the gov for the oil in the “Padre’s” property they had to include her as a legal heir in the case
4835 2018-12-17 16:01:08 Okay! But they are buying foreign oil with Alberta Transfer Payments!
4836 2018-12-17 16:01:06 Spent all day fixing the VW Camper from it's catastrophic oil leak.

Still broken.
4837 2018-12-17 16:00:59 Okay im thinking this weekend i wanna build a house with the oil pastels tonight hmu.
4838 2018-12-17 16:00:55 Ok you don't want oil... but Asia want and need oil, if Canada don't sell it don't worry, other country can increase production, like Iran with tar sands with no regulations... find reportage in YouTube.  Enjoy
4839 2018-12-17 16:00:51 the Steele Dossier is correct and Trump was offered 19% of the commissions from the brokerage of Russian oil giant Rosneft in exchange for him lifting sanctions, and Trump agreed, that would amount to TREASON.

That's not American First!
That's Trump & Russia First!

4843 2018-12-17 16:00:31 you know if you ignore that fact that it gives you super cancer, coconut oil is still disgusting
4844 2018-12-17 16:00:27 Salt. If I learned anything, salt is your friend. Maaaaybe holy oil, but there's this old French story where "holy oil" is not what you think...
4845 2018-12-17 16:00:17 That he is a fraud and a failure. If there is proof he groveled for some crumbs while laundering the money Putin stole from Russia’s oil and gas industry, that would do it.
4846 2018-12-17 16:00:03 Idag, för 109 år sedan:
John D. Rockefellers bolag Standard Oil i USA döms för brott mot USA:s antitrustlagar.
4847 2018-12-17 16:00:00 Someone just made +14.26% on WCX: buy WTI Crude Oil 50.349 → 50.708 (20x leverage)  ~ OOOULALA $WTICO $USD
4848 2018-12-17 15:59:47 Stopping foreign oil imports by building a pipeline from Alberta to Ontario, or Quebec, or perhaps as far as the east coast, will replace each and every job lost with ten more. And make the world a better place in the process.

4850 2018-12-17 15:59:39 The Diesel engine was originally designed to be run on a fuel derived from the Hemp plant. Carbon neutral environmentally friendly, non polluting. HEMP is banned because it would stop the profits of the big oil companies.
4851 2018-12-17 15:59:39 Who need a oil change and alignment I got one from groupon
4852 2018-12-17 15:59:12 I think the stimulus of cheaper oil may fade as we delay completions and possibly begin stacking out rigs, but otherwise think you have a typically good list. This morning's HMI and Empire Fed weren't helpful, but there are positives out there.
4853 2018-12-17 15:59:12 Forour family friend that's my mum's age, and who is extremely generous to us but also has the money to get anything she needs I do a bag of wee fancy things, either food or bath stuff

Fancy box of cookies, bar of chocolate, fancy olive oil, fancy jam etc, I spend like $50
4854 2018-12-17 15:59:11 Could be some pushback on the Saudi/Quebec angle. Saw a graph where Quebec last imported Saudi oil in 2012. Now it goes to Irving refineries in New Brunswick. Perhaps it eventually ends up in Quebec, but apparently no tankers in St. Lawrence carry Saudi oil. True or not?
4855 2018-12-17 15:59:11 Can i move to an olive oil farm in Italy already
4856 2018-12-17 15:59:11  lemme guess...it also knows how to oil itself and wield a red handkerchief?
4857 2018-12-17 15:59:10 EPIC grape juice olive oil victorias secret perfume i love nutglob waistband are weak.
4858 2018-12-17 15:59:08 I thought I had excema because I had some sort of rash-thing going on around my eyes. It turned out I was allergic to Vitamin E oil! The very same thing I recently bought because someone told me it was GOOD for my eye-skin. *sigh*
4859 2018-12-17 15:58:59 Sex-well方程式
4860 2018-12-17 15:58:58 Need to get a new oil pipe or something
4861 2018-12-17 15:58:50 What if Ukraine had full rights to Crimean oil and Gas until they join the EU after which it could be reclaimed by Russia over a five year transition. Once Ukraine is in EU their economic future is much safer and they should be transitioning to renewable by then...
4862 2018-12-17 15:58:33 Perhaps because lawmakers have little to no grasp of the technology and so take unsubstantiated claims of accuracy by technologists at face value? Its what they do with everything: They let bankers tell them how to regulate banks, let big oil tell them how to regulate energy. 
4863 2018-12-17 15:58:29 U.S. diplomats hold talks with Taliban on ending Afghan war: DON'T NEED NO PHUK'N TALKS ! JUST THROW OUR PHUK'N REPUBLICUNT FINANCIAL & "OIL" KOCH-SUK'N HOODS THE PHUK OUTTA AFGHAN AND IRAQ WHERE THEY NEVER EVER BELONGED IN THE FIRST PHUK'N PLACE !!
4864 2018-12-17 15:58:26 Lmaooo. Oil F.c fan trying to have a go at us. Mate your club would be in the 3rd division if it was not for oil hahaha. Your club legend is shaun goater Ffs. Sit down you glory hunting clown 
4865 2018-12-17 15:58:24 I feel bad for ladies that dont know much about cars when they go get an oil change smh
4866 2018-12-17 15:58:20 @osmo_uk Hi, we are looking to use Raw oil for oak parquet floors, but some websites say we should use it 2 coats, and some say 1 coat + 1 coat of Polyx®-Oil Original. Which one is right?
4867 2018-12-17 15:58:18 ไม่เชื่อว่าเบียร์คิมจะงดบินค่ะ 55555555
4868 2018-12-17 15:58:17 Engine oil? 
Grease?
Brake fluid?
Ball bearing?
4869 2018-12-17 15:58:01 I feel like Oil can trade back to $55 soon
4870 2018-12-17 15:57:51 Good things people are ignoring right now 

-growth stimulus from cheaper oil 
-activity rebound from lower rates 
-detente in trade war 
-potential for infrastructure spending in the US 
-2019 earnings growth 
-employment is still expanding 
-retail sales growth is really strong
4871 2018-12-17 15:57:31 You go girl! Congratulations for making history!

4874 2018-12-17 15:57:09 Saidi oil goes to Irving oil in New Brunswick...not Quebec.
It is refined into gasoline and 80% is sent to the US.
4875 2018-12-17 15:57:03 Water , witch hazel and coconut oil does the trick  .. my skin is finally clearing up
4876 2018-12-17 15:56:52 Vaccinations cause lizard-morphing! Don’t vaccinate! Public school is a brainwashing tool for the terminally uncool! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
4877 2018-12-17 15:56:50 Unli chicken oil oh diba hahhahahha
4878 2018-12-17 15:56:42 Going to be making some purple cotton candy coconut oil today mmmmmm
4879 2018-12-17 15:56:41 Lol, that's some dumb shit right there dude, you openly lie about reality and now you're lying once more,it began when Chavez didn't bother to diversify the economy, then when the Saudis made it so the oil prices dropped ur economy began to crumble, combine that with US sanctions
4880 2018-12-17 15:56:23 Nope. Slice it up, coat it in oil and whatever seasoning, bake until tender, mash it if you want
4881 2018-12-17 15:56:05 This is to check your oil right?
4882 2018-12-17 15:56:00 ...Heartbreak <<< Hot oil bursting onto your face.
4883 2018-12-17 15:56:00 I don’t want oil left in the ground. If I had my way BC would be exploring for offshore oil and seeing if we could compete with Alberta and such competition would be good because it would give the provinces incentive to drive production costs down
4884 2018-12-17 15:55:46 We should be shipping oil out of Hudson Bay to NB and Que...all oil used in Canada needs to be Canadian....
4885 2018-12-17 15:55:36 The oil I sent should help with that!
4886 2018-12-17 15:55:35 that would eb a hoot.. but i sense trump statements give powell no room to change even if he wanted to.. he has low oil forcover to stop hiking. Trump just creating his own alibi today and every time he blames fed for stock drop.
4887 2018-12-17 15:55:23 I ask that question myself. I dont think my burara self can take losing 9k pesos worth of earphones.  But the sound quality of that thing is 
4888 2018-12-17 15:55:23 Sitting here getting my oil changed, looking back at my old tweets. Don’t see anything to controversial so I’m volunteering to host the Oscars this year. Merry Christmas to all.
4889 2018-12-17 15:55:22 I didn't notice it before bc it's a split second in the pv but it looks like they used oil on glass to make texture they could use for an overlay for this shot? IT'S SO GOOD. BONES SAID WE'RE GONNA GIVE THEM EVERYTHING THEY WANT
4890 2018-12-17 15:55:06 I’m too cheap for them fancy ass cars that need $100 oil changes 
4891 2018-12-17 15:55:03 Prevention goes a long way too. How about prohibiting oil and gas from operating where people live? Heavy Industrial Operations in neighborhoods make people sick. #BanFracking and the population will be healthier. HB40 must be repealed this legislative session. #Healthcare
4892 2018-12-17 15:54:57 Reminds me of those fake preachers (snake oil) portraited in old western movies, CONMAN
4893 2018-12-17 15:54:56 We should include BC’s thermal coal exports in their GHG emissions as well. You know it’s only equivalent to what the Great Canadian Oil Sands is responsible for.
4894 2018-12-17 15:54:56  Yeh kitni ungaliyaan hain? 
Oil  lga k daikh lo shyd hojain 
4895 2018-12-17 15:54:55 Por tener primos como él estamos así! Y respecto a la bebida te falto tomar gas oil 
4896 2018-12-17 15:54:55 Just found out there's a National Candle Association and an alleged scandal with the oil industry surrounding the use of paraffin, a product that is generated through the petroleum refinery process. Merry Christmas.
4897 2018-12-17 15:54:52 วันนี้สอนให้รู้การขับรถเวลาเจอไฟเหลือง ให้เหยียบสุดตีนเลยค่ะ
4898 2018-12-17 15:54:42 you getting the hoes do ya thang kid maybe i need put some oil on to pull em like you.
4899 2018-12-17 15:54:41 yummmm road dirt, oil and whatever else...
4900 2018-12-17 15:54:34 We would not recommend changing or adding the oil to your Stand Mixer yourself as we are unable to assist with this.  However, if this is the route you would like to follow, you can purchase the oil at 855-845-9684.  Hopefully this helps.
4901 2018-12-17 15:54:29 That Saudi oil is destined for the US...that's why.
Trudeau is focused on shutting down Alberta oil.
4902 2018-12-17 15:54:16 WHITE HOUSE TRADE ADVISOR NAVARRO SAYS  FED SHOULD NOT RAISE INTEREST RATES ON WEDNESDAY BECAUSE ECONOMY IS GROWING WITHOUT INFLATION ... and no inflation going with oil at $50 for a few more qtrs CPI should dip below 2% now
4903 2018-12-17 15:54:12 @MahmoodKhanCM You must visit District Karak, as per schedule. The district has suffered in the last government and should not suffer this time. University building, oil refinery, water schemes and other projects await you.
4904 2018-12-17 15:54:10 Anointed with military oil
4905 2018-12-17 15:54:05 tomato-rice-leek type of stew-oto! and lots of olive oil too.
4906 2018-12-17 15:53:57 @jaimelawson08 hey bud, I have a friend who suffers badly with fibromialgia (o however the fk you spell it lol)  would cbd oil help with that?
4907 2018-12-17 15:53:47 Be his beard oil!!!
4908 2018-12-17 15:53:20 I'm going to assume you don't use any appliances or smart devices.  That your clothing and accessories are all made oil free.  And that you bike everywhere you go.  If not, stfu and reduce the demand before killing jobs that go to the Saudis instead.
4909 2018-12-17 15:53:19 Perhaps 400,000 Oil and Gas workers across Canada should know why they no longer have a job...
4910 2018-12-17 15:53:01 For sure! People seem to discount the hazard that railing oil out poses, not to mention the ripple effect clogging the rail lines with oil causes in other Canadian industries, grain and potash come to mind.
4911 2018-12-17 15:52:50 I got this kia 6 years ago. keep the tune ups and the oil changes. im trying to ride it for another 6. 
4912 2018-12-17 15:52:44 It is surprising given oil and stocks are all down....still holding the support in my chart and that wedge is still in play so fingers crossed.
4913 2018-12-17 15:52:43 Europe/hiting up/ASIA slowing-strong $/ oil glut/rate hike/gridlock/debt/tradeT
4914 2018-12-17 15:52:42 Why don't Canadian provinces have the option of sending commodities, say Alberta oil, to Quebec in lieu of transfer payments? It would be good for economy and save billions of actual dollars. @PaulMassel
4915 2018-12-17 15:52:41 I hate going to get my oil changed, bitch I know I need new brakes but did I come here for that service?
4916 2018-12-17 15:52:36 心斎橋のメンズエステSARISARIでは、セラピストを募集しております。35歳までの健康で明るい女性の方(*^^)vご連絡 お待ちしております。06-4704-6102もしくはhealing-garden-sarisari@i.softbank.jp#セラピスト求人
4917 2018-12-17 15:52:27 Look at that photo filled with oil based products
4918 2018-12-17 15:52:20 So lobby to pass federal laws banning oil companies from importing oil then.

Is that what Andrew Scheer and Kenny are suggesting? Something tells me their oil company overlords would put a stop to that real quick.
4919 2018-12-17 15:52:19 And allot get shipped with some of the oil missing and then who knows how they fill em up or what they fill em with. It’s a dirty game
4920 2018-12-17 15:52:13 Dawn soap has built its name around being gentle enough to clean animals who have been impacted by oil spills. And O&G isn’t a problem? Okay.
4921 2018-12-17 15:52:07 Dun tayo sa kahit walang chili oil si tita che ay pumapalag pa rin sa hot sauce
4922 2018-12-17 15:51:56 Wow you’re real genius with Great solutions. Or  buy @Tesla every time you charge it somebody in USA makes money not Saudi Arabia And we all  breathe cleaner air and many people get jobs in the process we don’t have to spend billions of dollars protecting  Middle East for oil
4923 2018-12-17 15:51:51 Healthcare still sucks - trumps in charge don’t blame anyone else!

No infrastructure - dominos does more!

No middle class tax cut

Destroying environment for oil/gas sales

Gutted FEMA when people needed it!

Tariffs=inflation=poor bonds
4924 2018-12-17 15:51:50 We are now energy independent and we don't have to rely on the middle east to survive on oil due to Trump. So when you climb in your chauffeur driven limo next time, you can thank the President that you are buying American instead of Saudi Arabian.
4925 2018-12-17 15:51:49 Goal for 2019:

Look like I have been dipped in coconut oil every day.
4926 2018-12-17 15:51:46 Go to bed at 5:30 AM, wake up to oil company banging on your door because you forgot to leave the money out  guess all I need is 5 hours of sleep. Haha  #oops #nosleeptilchristmas
4927 2018-12-17 15:51:40 めちゃんこ寒い外界から家に帰ったらあったかい鍋が食べられるのをめちゃんこ待ってたのでソッコー食らいついたら鼻水が止まりまてん
4928 2018-12-17 15:51:35 Pssst... world oil demand, production and consumption keeps rising and if we didn’t sell it at massive discounts, still very profitable.
4929 2018-12-17 15:51:32 Coal lobbyist runs EPA. Oil lobbyist slated for Dept. of Interior. Sigh. Does the corruption and penchant for destruction of our beautiful planet have no bottom?
4930 2018-12-17 15:51:30 olive oil is
4931 2018-12-17 15:51:30 does oil matter again?
4932 2018-12-17 15:51:29 Someone should tell her she needs to bribe him with squirrel oil if she wants to get the real scoop.
4933 2018-12-17 15:51:23 Or she would have tried to take over completely. I bet we only occupy the part necessary to build a pipeline to Turkey. So this isn't about oil at all. It about evil, evil Assad.
4934 2018-12-17 15:51:20 Bigger leeks work well if you trim them, cut them in half lengthways, put them in an oven dish, drizzle with olive oil and a few bits of tomato, then bake them in a hot oven for half an hour. Crispy and juicy. And leeky.
4935 2018-12-17 15:51:19 tangina wala akong naubutan na chicken oil kanina sa mang-inasal

4937 2018-12-17 15:50:51 My work wants me to use more "memes" and weird stuff in our social posts, but I feel like saying "Real maple syrup was used in the making of this picture. No motor oil in sight" is a bit too nuanced for our following.
4938 2018-12-17 15:50:42 So I’m at orientation and I’m pretty sure this chicks outfit inspiration came from Olive Oil from Popeye
4939 2018-12-17 15:50:35 It was a little roll-on oil.
4940 2018-12-17 15:50:34 Obviously prepared for a Hail Mary with Gronk in safety slot, he turns slower than an oil tanker
4941 2018-12-17 15:50:33 Canada does not buy saudi oil.

Private oil companies buy and sell oil in Canada.
4942 2018-12-17 15:50:32 @AndrewScheer sure..may as well speed up the recession to align with GM exit and AB oil patch roll backs and our pending Carbon tax in January... glad we didn't let the Libs run a major unplanned debt.. whoops...
4943 2018-12-17 15:50:24 Snake oil salesman who supports a conman. Heathens each and every one of them.
4944 2018-12-17 15:50:19 Knitting while my car gets inspected and oil changed apparently means talk to me about how young women dont have these skills anymore and its amazing to see.... can u not. Let me knit in peace
4945 2018-12-17 15:50:07 We here in Oklahoma sure do love our many man made earthquakes! I'm so glad our dumbass government decided to tax oil and gas companies at 1% and ruin our schools and economy! I was pissed before but now there's a gif of a dog!
4946 2018-12-17 15:49:52 I thought conservatives believed in the free market 

Are you suggesting the Canadian federal government enact laws to make it illegal for oil processing companies to import foreign oil?
4947 2018-12-17 15:49:50 100% too much! I couldn't agree with you more. Given the facts presented in the Globe and Mail article, Canada should immediatly move to suspend all oil and military transactions with the Saudis.
4948 2018-12-17 15:49:40 “It will help with better gas mileage.” Sounds fake just change my oil, sir.
4949 2018-12-17 15:49:39 @Matt_Burleigh this will go in the weirdest job offers going. Applied for a door to door sales Job... no previous experiance required..great opportunity for backpackers.. email this evening....dear Thomas this is a door to door job selling oil paintings are you still intrested?
4950 2018-12-17 15:49:20 - cook sweet potatoes in oven or air fryer. 400°F for 12 mins in air fryer. Check the back label to see oven directions
- big ol’ pot. Throw all the ground turkey in there. I use cooking spray, olive oil is fine too. Stir turkey to break it up. Then cook till its no longer pink.
4951 2018-12-17 15:49:18 Put 4 tablespoons of baby oil in your bath water. Your skin will be silky smooth in no time.
4952 2018-12-17 15:49:17 Oh, please! <sigh> Stop with the "big oil" and "poisoning our environment" arguments! The Democrats are more corrupt than any Republicans, so just stop it!!!
4953 2018-12-17 15:49:17 ねぇそんなことより今娘が寝言で歌った。
鼻歌？もにゃもにゃ言ってたけどたぶん「山の音楽家」だわ( ´・∀・｀)ｶﾜｲｽｷﾞｶ

-Have A Lovely Day
4956 2018-12-17 15:48:53 It does.  Solar doesn’t get the same passes for pollution from the gov as Oil/Coal/Gas get.  We can actually find out what waste they produce, and how they are dealing with it.   You are going from gigatons/yr of waste&pollution with coal to thousands of tons with solar/wind
4957 2018-12-17 15:48:51 Deep fry in oil as you would for breakfast, ukatekate alafu ukaange na viungo. Inadonjo.
4958 2018-12-17 15:48:50 But as adults we must be responsible. We can’t be leaving Cans of oil within kids reach.
4959 2018-12-17 15:48:46 Per capita is irrelevant. China alone burns more coal than all other nations combined. A billion Indians burning wood or coal or oil is a lot of Co2. Brazil busy cutting down the rain forest for It's out of control population expansion.
4960 2018-12-17 15:48:46 WTI oil futures take a turn lower in Nymex trading.
Jan. WTI oil down 90 cents, or 1.8%, at $50.30/bbl

4961 2018-12-17 15:48:32 I was told about the next ice age in the 1960s. 1970s Jimmy Carter told us no more oil left by the year 2000. " biggest crisis man will ever face". 1980s they said the earth could not sustain 7 billion people. 2000s global warming. Now is climate change. The bs never ends.
4962 2018-12-17 15:48:26 Brexit was a paid scam. THAT's undemocratic. Our democracy was subverted by lies&cheating&blinkered fools bought the snake oil. Think of the lack of respect needed to pull a scam like that. You do know btw, that an advisory Ref is not legally binding? Don't believe me. Look it up
4963 2018-12-17 15:48:20 And two other facilities close. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce agrees your WRONG. Carbon pricing is necessary to transition into oil free products. If only we could transition away from you. You are a walking mistake.
4964 2018-12-17 15:48:13 Should be #LeaveItInTheGround here too. The solution is EVs, electric buses, improved cycling infrastructure, things like that you've been working on. We'll have more pumped bitumen than we can sell at a profit in only a couple years due to an oil glut from electric vehicles.
4965 2018-12-17 15:48:06 You will not abandon the oil consuming automobile!!!
4966 2018-12-17 15:47:52 Expression of undying love #Oil @CNBC? "2019 will be better"? Chart indicated how silly $100 talk? $75 top? $52 midpoint consolidation? Suggests risk down to $29? $42 support solid? Battleground trading around current support, inconclusive?
4967 2018-12-17 15:47:49 All, please remember that the Fed keeps the US currency stable. It’s the one thing, that you want in any currency. The Fed kept currency stable when it was backed by gold and now when it is backed by oil.  Any replacement/reform must keep our currency stable.

4969 2018-12-17 15:47:37 You're in for a lot of tea tree oil soap :)
4970 2018-12-17 15:47:32 Jonathan any anger towards continued support Saudi oil after the horrific murder? #ableg #cdnpoli
4971 2018-12-17 15:47:23 .@Boilerjuice i've been on hold for over an hour & my phone battery has now gone. I have also DM'd you. I need to know when my oil will arrive. It should have arrived before 14th & I was promised a delivery today...but nothing.
4972 2018-12-17 15:47:17 oil down, xop almost green, GUSH for a trade
4973 2018-12-17 15:47:15 mama gunakan olive oil sebab lagi healthier
4974 2018-12-17 15:47:13 Almond oil!
4975 2018-12-17 15:47:10 Amin ya rabbi.
4976 2018-12-17 15:47:08 On the one hand, all the pre-paid maintenance on my car is awesome, cuz y'know free oil changes, etc., etc. On the other hand, having to call and TALK TO SOMEONE at the dealership to set up the service makes me long for the days when I could just pull up to Jiffylube.
4977 2018-12-17 15:46:53 Biodiesel only works if it mitigates the secondary problem of oil disposal. If it doesn't it's DOA.
Which is partially why cellulose ethanol failed. A good theoretical idea (turn lawn clippings and other yard waste into fuel). But it didn't lower the disposal costs.
4978 2018-12-17 15:46:43 おなかいたい…ゆたんぽあったかい…
4979 2018-12-17 15:46:36 Tu fais de la snake oil. Point.
C’est accepté  par tout le monde et en particulier Schneier : un algo fermé, pas de papier = snake oil. Point.
4980 2018-12-17 15:46:29 Feeling pretty good entering 2019 with some of my positions - most notably $WNDR $SDE $GRAT $BUDD and $ATH which has been holding up fairly well considering oil these days. $SDE will be trading as $SOU soon. $WNDR closing massive deal - will be very special  #stockstowatch
4981 2018-12-17 15:46:24 Isn’t is a shame. I’m staying true to my nissans lmao they’re cute and affordable . I don’t want any kinda car I can’t put regla gas in and get $40 oil changes.
4982 2018-12-17 15:46:21 You should have applied penetrating oil. And if that doesn't work apply heat.
4983 2018-12-17 15:46:21 O_O' oil.....
4984 2018-12-17 15:46:19 I’m sure you have good intentions but anyone that is knowledgeable about the oil & gas industry will disagree with you.
4985 2018-12-17 15:46:00 that being said, we make Alton Brown’s popcorn recipie at home. The secret is powderized salt in the cooking oil, and a healthy amount of melted Kerrygold.
4986 2018-12-17 15:45:57 ないないーーーーーwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww

かわいい子ですねーーーーーーwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
4987 2018-12-17 15:45:56 Okay so that's much better than taking fish oil pills and getting fish oil burps
4988 2018-12-17 15:45:46 You want the PM to control the sale of oil in canada?

So you are against free markets.
4989 2018-12-17 15:45:39 2016 was lead by the oil sector, now the slower growth is shown in other sectors like financial, tech and consumer cyclical. central banks are not showing as much support this time around yet...
4990 2018-12-17 15:45:31 So if you take a peppermint oil pill, you'll burp peppermint. Just FYI.

4992 2018-12-17 15:45:13 Et si tu n’as pas encore compris que le nerf de la guerre de la crypto est la compromission des clefs et non de l’algo générique du dessous, alors tu fais juste de la snake oil au kilomètre.
4993 2018-12-17 15:45:09 Yea, u didn’t kno? It was only for men and they were all nude w oil on their bodies to make their skin shine,,,

Im a History Nerd, stuff like this is like 2+2 for me
4994 2018-12-17 15:45:09 Now those 30%middle class plus few 10%patriotic people slowly are realizing & understanding the designs of many Arab countries to make Bharat Muslim as it is the last bastion left as unfinished agenda.
By reducing our dependence on Arab oil, Hindus can hv Bharat as their home.
4995 2018-12-17 15:45:06 3. Celebrations.

Cadbury sources palm oil irresponsibly and Nestle markets baby milk formula irresponsibly, so Mars wins by not being as messed up as the other two.
Plus Roses and Quality Street have too many inedible choices.
4996 2018-12-17 15:44:57 *he scratched his head watching as they passed by* ".....humans are some freaky creatures...." *He sips some oil from his metal cup*
4997 2018-12-17 15:44:50 our plan should be to: maximize oil/gas export at world price, surtax exports & use to fund building world class renewable industry, cut domestic use of fossil fuel and export more oil/gas, further accelerate renewable industry .. that is the holy grail for Canada!!! Let's do it!
4998 2018-12-17 15:44:48 want some oil on that ass baby
4999 2018-12-17 15:44:45 games gone from oil money luton fc0
5000 2018-12-17 15:44:40 That sounds wonderful, except your economy relies too much on oil. Some South American country is falling apart due to a similar reliance. That is a recipe for future disaster, and MBS seems to want to diversify the portfolio, good on him for that.
5001 2018-12-17 15:44:38 I would love to chat more about sustainable palm oil. I understand it’s a better option, but still struggle to understand exactly how much of a better option it is.
5002 2018-12-17 15:44:31 At a moment in history when oil imports to the US are touching multidecade lows. A terrible motive that just now isn’t even rooted in fact. Very Trumpy.

育児本を読み漁って、そんな気になってるだけかもしれんが。
5005 2018-12-17 15:44:19 Say “whale oil beef hooked” in any accent..
5006 2018-12-17 15:44:10 oil down, XOP almost green
look at GUSH on the long side
5007 2018-12-17 15:44:06 Hmm, Wish it had some kind of calculation.  Also is oil and gas production differ from oil and gas production and services, refineries.  In that time mentioned gdp growth what near 10%, but oil production is also up so wonder how that big of change is explained.
5008 2018-12-17 15:44:05 Distractions, while you let our oil industry flounder, trade deteriorate and China access anything they want.
5009 2018-12-17 15:44:05 Takte bat kasi napakarami naman netong castor oil na to huhu
5010 2018-12-17 15:44:03 AhzhzhahqhzHhaha sana oil
5011 2018-12-17 15:44:00 Lol! Very good. Do you think maybe the PM has an impact or at least could try to have an impact on what CANADA has for oil prices? That “PM doesn’t control global oil prices” excuse is dead. Just ask the rest of the world that is selling at market or at least near market price.
5012 2018-12-17 15:43:50 @business @CNN @FoxNews it's funny to see news media trying to manipulate the Oil prices but the fact is there is an over supply which means that oil prices will stay low for many months and great for the American economy!
5013 2018-12-17 15:43:43 Haven't bought anything with palm oil in over 8 months.  

It, and the products that contain it, are replaceable.   

Its not worth it.

5019 2018-12-17 15:42:57 The entire progressive era is full of cases similar to that with companies seeking state intervention to kill their competition, like in the meat-packing industry, steel, oil, transport, etc.
5020 2018-12-17 15:42:46 CANADA does not buy oil this is a lie. Private Corporations do.
5021 2018-12-17 15:42:39 Dear God,
In this Dec kindly replace all my fake friends with bag of rice,tin tomato,Maggi,groundnut oil,chicken n dollars.
Amen
5022 2018-12-17 15:42:34 What if I treat myself to lunch at my favorite breakfast/lunch place and then go to the olive oil store?
5023 2018-12-17 15:42:31 I need to get my oil changed but I'm so fucking lazy
5024 2018-12-17 15:42:26 I'm buying myself an oil change for my birthday. 
5025 2018-12-17 15:42:15 I have at least 6,000 calories daily, mostly coconut oil. #Pioppi #LCHF #CoconutOil #Health
5026 2018-12-17 15:42:14 So, you'll buy another one?  Don't forget Castor Oil! Ke Dezemba boss!
5027 2018-12-17 15:41:57 Elf 1: "Did you see on the news what they did now?"
Elf 2: "Another damn oil spill. These people don't deserve toys."

 "Awesome, I hear Satan has f**ing rad health benefits"
5028 2018-12-17 15:41:56 That’s the thing, if this ever happened in a house we were occupying, and my parents found out, Chile the praying in tongues and amount of anointing oil that would’ve gone into such an undertaking would’ve been unfathomable
5029 2018-12-17 15:41:39 I want to drink castor oil tomorrow ... am sick 
5030 2018-12-17 15:41:39 A rise in the price of oil, for one. 
Uncertainty breeds higher price, and they knew Fraud Boy would make lots of uncertainty.
5031 2018-12-17 15:41:28 oil and hair milk has been my bff! moisture will take u a loooonnnggg way
5032 2018-12-17 15:41:22 What a bunch of hogwash, you have never fought for the Oil & Gas Industry and I can’t wait for the spring election when you will suffer a humiliating loss & your political career is over.
5033 2018-12-17 15:41:12 อยากมี passion ในการดูมาก
5034 2018-12-17 15:41:07 Did they?  And why is your NDP in Alberta advocating for pipelines and railcars for their dirty oil?  Because ideology meets reality when a party forms government.
5035 2018-12-17 15:40:59 Last time I checked IRVING is buying Saudi oil, not Canada.
5036 2018-12-17 15:40:57 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
5037 2018-12-17 15:40:56 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
5038 2018-12-17 15:40:51 hate waiting on oil changes

5041 2018-12-17 15:40:34 I took my car to get an oil change today without my dad’s help 
5042 2018-12-17 15:40:28 I want to make carrot oil but I just don’t have the strength.
5043 2018-12-17 15:40:28 libtard ignorant nonsense:
  - multiculturalism - Muslims integrate
  - windmills & mirrors can replace oil & coal
5044 2018-12-17 15:40:22 Who is Alberta going to blame when the whole friggin world moves away from fossil fuels? I work in the oil and gas industry and I hope for a day where we become reliant on renewable energy resources and we take actual action on climate change.
5045 2018-12-17 15:40:17 The oil industry experienced the same "lower costs from technology" in 1986 after everybody got laid off @aeberman12
5046 2018-12-17 15:40:12 he's dripping grease now? does he even need frying oil

5051 2018-12-17 15:39:55 Walking in the hood with 2litres of cooking oil be like driving by at 10km/hr in a 2019 C63 AMG, all eyes on you.

5053 2018-12-17 15:39:42 #JKX been buying back into one of the cheapest oil (10%)and gas (90%) producers out there. Focus is on results early January which promise to transform the Company into a cash positive position. Catalyst for me buying back was last court ruling / win and directors buying mid 40s
5054 2018-12-17 15:39:35 Happy Monday, hoping everyone has a great week - One week until Christmas Eve! 

Today's prices

5055 2018-12-17 15:39:23 It'll be interesting to see a) if it's sustainable and b) if it saves cost in the long run and c) who saves those costs.
I could see a system where fuel costs don't decrease much because it's actually saved in oil disposal costs.
5056 2018-12-17 15:39:22 after much trial and error with facial oils... jojoba oil is that bitch! i love it.
5057 2018-12-17 15:39:07 Wah gwan fi the missing oil dem?
5058 2018-12-17 15:38:55 Can we please try to not mischaracterize what hard working people in the oil patch do?
5059 2018-12-17 15:38:40 Oh yes she and minions were fighting, against oil and gas, and pipelines by protesting and speaking against pipelines. So, yes she will never stop fighting, but are she and minions credible and believable?
5060 2018-12-17 15:38:37 You say that, but people must pay it. 

That's after discount btw.  Should be £245. Or £234 if I go to Yeovil instead.  

I can source the oem filter and correct oil for less than £50. How about that for labour?!
5061 2018-12-17 15:38:29 Thanks. It seems we need silicon oil as immersion liquid. Unfortunately I can use dry lens only.
5062 2018-12-17 15:38:15 very nice you skin care ko may halong luha

5063 2018-12-17 15:38:06 The oil level this morning is a little bit too cold to run, we are going to have a slight delay of about 1hr. We will try to be running before 8.30am
5064 2018-12-17 15:37:54 Hi there. Yes I agree totally. I have been researching palm oil for over a year, talking to many companies (I’m in the spa industry) and I feel like I opened a can of worms! It’s incredibly complex with so many factors xx
5065 2018-12-17 15:37:52 Not good. I cringe at the thought of adding another pill to my daily tray. I really have no clue what to do and have days I can't stand up now. Its happening so fast and no one can help. The last time I felt no pain from my bones was when I drank a bunch of oil. It felt so good!
5066 2018-12-17 15:37:50 เบื่อด้วย

5069 2018-12-17 15:37:39 Oh snap! But my salad's only dressing is salt and pepper and balsamic vinegar. Anything with oil or mayo turns it gross! And rocket. Burns my tongue.

5082 2018-12-17 15:36:44 The CEO of Mexican state oil company says he got up at 4 am to make it to his first meeting with Lopez Obrador, and says only one brain cell is working. That's a terrible thing to say, says interviewer @AristeguiOnline, you are the director of Pemex.

5089 2018-12-17 15:35:59 They don’t get oil from Saudi Arabia. 
They do get a lot of it from Alberta and refine by Suncor in Quebec.
5090 2018-12-17 15:35:53 What Bernard the Roughneck said about Alta oil. "It puts chicken in the pot in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia. It puts a roast in the oven in Miramichi, New Brunswick. It puts tortiere on the fork in Granby, Quebec. And it puts tofu on the table in Toronto and Vancouver" What about us?

5099 2018-12-17 15:35:03 It’s an opinion column by an oil lobbyist. His article doesn’t provide any evidence to disprove the overwhelming consensus among scientists.

5101 2018-12-17 15:35:00 Cakes and breads are one third each of maida, sugar and lard/butter - arguably one of the worst foods on the planet. Baking doesn’t make that kind of food healthy. And contrary to popular belief, intake of moderate amount of oil does not adversely affect health.
5102 2018-12-17 15:34:53 I agree with you on that. Gas is cleaner than coal and oil, but it's still a fossil fuel.

5104 2018-12-17 15:34:38 Oh for sure, and I bet I'm underestimating the amount of oil (though that 1 to 1 thing is nuts for an assumption), but it's still just a drop in the bucket. If it's profitable, by all means do it, but I don't think it'll make much difference.
5105 2018-12-17 15:34:37 Beard oil or balm helps *a ton*. Also, not shampooing it every day, but using conditioner, helps too.
5106 2018-12-17 15:34:28 See if anyone where you live provides a TNR intiative for feral cats. You might be able to borrow a trap. Try attracting him by using canned tuna in oil. It doesn't dry out so it keeps it stinking longer for the cat to find it. I'll say a prayer he comes home! 
5107 2018-12-17 15:34:10 HAHN: 10 years, 315 million dollars.

HAHN: Ok, If my boss hears about this he will kill me. The contract plus a year of Sirius Satellite Radio - do you like Howard Stern? Plus free oil changes, and unlimited car washes.
5108 2018-12-17 15:33:51 If Canada uses the money we would save using our own oil instead of importing it from overseas on clean energy research, it would be the single biggest influx of money into Clean energy in history. #useyourbrain

5112 2018-12-17 15:33:37 I suppose Raab does have a point after witnessing David Davis turn in 4 hours work in two years when he was Brexit secretary. Also, not forgetting the midnight oil Davis burnt when compiling those in-depth impact studies.

And now with #TheDawning I'm wringing butter, milk, and oil from their corpses to bake treats for my friends? Yikes.
5117 2018-12-17 15:32:53 If you think you’re not going to be here and Jesus warns about people falling away and betraying like the verse I just showed you..
The people that 100 percent believe pre trib are going to be so confused they won’t understand what’s happening and will run out of oil.
5118 2018-12-17 15:32:52 They say you can hear them scream when they’re plunged into the hot oil. It’s awful. They really are a barbarous people.

5148 2018-12-17 15:30:15 I greatly fear that there are many, many more Canadians that buy your false narratives than Saudi oil. Canada is not in the oil business, period. Oil companies, refining companies, transport companies, retail energy companies--they import oil. You want Canada to nationalize them?
5149 2018-12-17 15:30:13 Can you show examples of where the NDP have done the same things here in Alberta? Just so you can go on the record youre against governments helping businesses? (unless there oil and gas company am I right?)reason 1,000,089 Southern Alberta deserves better representation then you
5150 2018-12-17 15:30:04 And pepperanata is fantastic. Halve peppers, de seed, add quarter Of tomato, slice of garlic, but if anchovy and a small knob of butter to each. Salt, pepper, drizzle very generously with olive oil. Bake slowly under foil.
5151 2018-12-17 15:29:35 I love my sprouts (fellow leaver) but halve them, drizzle them in olive oil, salt bae them and roast them with a selection of other veggies. Much more betterer.

5156 2018-12-17 15:29:02 Took another personal trade loss in oil this morning at open (took one late last week also) - letting the machine trade oil ONLY for now on :) Less stress on me personally and the machine trade wins (loses little when it does). That was a vicious sell off.

5158 2018-12-17 15:28:53 We are being pushed out and systematically abused by the east.  They tell the world not to buy our oil, and then ship our public sector rural  jobs to the cities or directly to Ottawa...

Yang Aldo bagi ialah Oil producing countries, almost semua negara ada minyak, sama ada Exporter atau Importer je determine harga minyak domestic !

Malaysia is NETT IMPORTER even we produce Oil.....

5179 2018-12-17 15:27:09 OIL IS THE KEY . I know people think it’s bad to put oils in your skin cuz it makes you break out, it makes you too oily, etc. but oil likes oil. If you have congested clogged pores, rub a body oil (coconut,sunflower,even olive oil) on that area before you wash your face

5181 2018-12-17 15:26:56 So, by your admission, Quebec is not importing Saudi oil. They are using refined product from a Canadian refinery that gets its raw product from Saudi Arabia.

5190 2018-12-17 15:26:09 *whispers in super quiet voice*...your rallies are not going to bring back the price of oil. It’s a commodity that is slowly being phased out as new energy technologies become more widely adopted.
5191 2018-12-17 15:26:08 They don’t. Saudi oil comes into Canada via New Brunswick. Since the Enbridge Line 9 reversal a few years back, most of the oil transported to Quebec comes from Alberta and the US.
5192 2018-12-17 15:26:03 That was the biggest turning point. A climate activist actually won, but two oil men took office. That was the moment we took a hard right into darkness. At that point, the disinformation campaign in the US began in earnest. Now climate denial is partisan, even religion for some.
5193 2018-12-17 15:26:02 Except in Ontario and Quebec, we have surplus energy (or capacity to crank it up) and that could eat into some of our dependence on oil.
5194 2018-12-17 15:26:02 I just hope the oil and gas industry doesn't tank again. Because chile...

5199 2018-12-17 15:25:40 Oil on the move.. Downward movement before new year. Fundamentals matter but old principle of hedge funds taking new positions and opec countries playing games is part of #oil trading
5200 2018-12-17 15:25:29 Cl didn't work. Profit margin wasn't there. I made mention of that in this morning's session. In addition Oil getting tricky because it's in a range. Knowing when to pass on trades is just as important as putting them on. #PDF
5201 2018-12-17 15:25:20 The Province of Quebec doesn't actually bring in any of this oil. It is brought in by players in the oil and refining industries. A small but critical point.
5202 2018-12-17 15:25:11 When your oil sees heat for 18 hours a day or more, sorta gotta change it.
5203 2018-12-17 15:25:11 Because the market decides what oil to buy, not the government.  Your ignorance should be astonishing but isn't.

A handful of onion
A handful of green pepper
1/2 cup oats
Season spice for fish

Didive into 4 & flatten them into patties. Fry in a bit of olive oil for about 2mins each side & serve with a side of avo
5213 2018-12-17 15:24:24 My grandmother used to HATE using new oil for cooking.
5214 2018-12-17 15:24:15 Most of the Alberta oil shipped to Quebec goes to the Suncor (formerly Petrocan) refinery in Montreal. It’s tooled to use diluted bitumen as a feedstock (it has a cracker). The other refineries don’t have coming capacity, so they can’t use dilbit (what we sell) as a feedstock.
5215 2018-12-17 15:24:13 The relative weakness in all the energy names $XLE $OIH the past few weeks leads me to believe $OIL has another leg down. Energy names couldn't bounce one bit even when oil had several one day bounces

5219 2018-12-17 15:23:40 If we can't pursue US and Russia to be more responsible we need to use more forceful methods like sanctions targetted at Oil & Gas Co. This would cause short term pain but is perhaps the only way to bring home the importance to them.

5222 2018-12-17 15:23:25 Should have studied more chemistry! Not all oil is the same! 
Most eastern Canadian refineries cannot process bitumen, the thick tar-like hydrocarbon that comes out of the Athabasca Oil Sands. Almost anybody world wide can process Saudi Arabian crude.

5232 2018-12-17 15:22:36 As per Press release,  Congress Vice President, Ghulam Mohd. Saroori (GM Saroori), has urged the J&K Governor N. N. Vohra to meet the required stock of Ration, fire wood and Kerosene oil in district Doda and Kishtwar before the onset of snowfall.
5233 2018-12-17 15:22:31 And yet I'm trying every shampoo and oil to stop hairfall
5234 2018-12-17 15:22:25 @livemint why don't the economic KPI values (Oil, Dollar, NSE, Gold) appear on your Chennai edition?
5235 2018-12-17 15:22:21 Some essential oils definately are interesting !! Tea tree oil for example! I say we need to try everything and in combination !!
5236 2018-12-17 15:22:19 Fun fact. Golden brown fries come from old oil. We'd get complaints *after* changing the oil that the fries were too pale

5238 2018-12-17 15:22:11 If there ever was a Wake Up Call for the colonies of AB and SK this is it. The imperial ruler just said his eastern country called Canada will not support oil from the colonies. They are literally kicking the west out. They do not want the west as part of their country.
5239 2018-12-17 15:22:09 gue pake sunflower oil kleveru
5240 2018-12-17 15:22:07 Fishing for oil?
5241 2018-12-17 15:21:56 Extra side of castor oil eh?
5242 2018-12-17 15:21:53 Oh, I've been using cbd vape oil, but I'm afraid I'd need a much higher mg/dose in order to even put a dent in the pain. But thank you! I've thought about getting some higher doses but... can't until Friday.

5244 2018-12-17 15:21:46 No, she is implying that artificial restrictions put on the oil industry by the Obama Admin have been removed and producers are now allowed to drill on US land! #DrillBabyDrill #ResourceRich #Innovate #Horizontal
5245 2018-12-17 15:21:46 But a white pizza will typicall still have olive oil or butter on the crust.
5246 2018-12-17 15:21:31 Thank you Mighty.
5247 2018-12-17 15:21:30 Diesel engine oil is heavy also
5248 2018-12-17 15:21:17 The Conservatives confuse me, Alberta is upset about pipelines. They need to get their oil to a refinery. They appear to be ok with piping it to a port in BC, to ship to Texas, to refine & then what? They’re upset about oil imports, shipping oil out does not make avail in Canada

5254 2018-12-17 15:20:23 I did a mix of olive oil and butter in cast iron
5255 2018-12-17 15:20:18 Most E&Ps are "price takers" & cannot make more than commodity price allows. Major oil is vertically integrated & makes money on value added by making & selling refined products. Low oil prices boost refining margins & become price takers when prices are high. Different models.
5256 2018-12-17 15:20:17 They are repeating same thing they did to GEJ. To make his own worse, they hoard the money he gave to them after sharing it amongst themselves. I just hope Atiku is wise enough to realize they are 'oil and gas' ....'owo epo'...igi da, eye fo.
5257 2018-12-17 15:20:16 This insane nonsense that Scotland can't afford to run itself is pathetic. Ignore oil, look at renewables, exports, tourism, financial sector, sciences etc. Exports alone, 25% of the entire UK food & drink export is Scotch Whisky, add to that Scottish beef, lamb, seafood etc.
5258 2018-12-17 15:20:12 Unpopular Hypothesis: The Fountain of Youth lies in McDonald's French fries.

You find fries that are months old in your car in pristine shape. Why aren't makeup companies using Mickey D's fry oil for rejuvenation?

 
5259 2018-12-17 15:19:56 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.

5263 2018-12-17 15:19:34 Busy week coming up. I'll be burning the midnight oil when all I really really really want is a zig-a-zig-ah.
5264 2018-12-17 15:19:30 For me, it was obvious that we could have started under President Carter, who put solar panels on the White House roof. Reagan immediately took them off when he moved in. We definitely could have started in the 70s. The oil companies started a disinformation campaign instead.

5267 2018-12-17 15:19:24 But where is our beard oil
5268 2018-12-17 15:19:22 But still....they have been importing 43% of their oil at WTI prices and we've been exporting WCS at $40 discount from the summer until a week or so ago
5269 2018-12-17 15:19:19 didn’t even fully know how much I needed that today, haha. some of us entered the geology department bc we think rocks and non human centered timekeeping is cool, not bc we wanna work for oil companies!!!!
5270 2018-12-17 15:19:16 Once a pore becomes clogged, it traps skin oil inside. Bacteria grows in this oil and can cause an inflammatory response in the skin.

5286 2018-12-17 15:17:43 I see some bankruptcies in the oil sector now. That'll affect the credit markets if it picks up steam.

5288 2018-12-17 15:17:29 & this is why I hate coming to get my oil changed 
5289 2018-12-17 15:17:20 The oil change place is playing Pearl Harbor, which I remember seeing (and LOVING) in theaters. Like HOW FREAKING STUNNING is Kate Beckinsale in this film?! (Also the score is one of my favorites of all time.)

5291 2018-12-17 15:17:17 So...I assume there will be special consideration for oil painting in the UK-US trade negotiations? 
5292 2018-12-17 15:17:14 If there's an extended power outage, Nfld Power loses money. If rates go high enough that people struggle to pay, or switch to oil, they don't make money. There are other situations where Nfld Power's interests are at odds with ratepayers, but not here.

5303 2018-12-17 15:15:56 The point is Quebec imports #oil rather then sourcing domestically within Canada. Meanwhile it takes in $13B in equalization payments of which much comes from Alberta.

5342 2018-12-17 15:12:19 Not really. Necessity is the mother of invention - so I believe as we get closer to running out of FF's (when oil prices skyrocket), more and more money will be put towards finding renewable alternatives that are cost competitive. Oh, and nuclear.
5343 2018-12-17 15:12:18 The smell of Texas I know includes the feedlot (when the wind blows the wrong way), oil, and occasionally natural gas.

TM adds 1 tanker a day..it's nonsense.
If they're worried about increased traffic in New Brunswick then stop bringing in Saudi oil destined for US markets. Complete hypocrisy
These arguments are as phony as a $3 bill and are about blocking Cdn oil not tankers.

5375 2018-12-17 15:09:53 Sorry about that, next time (I hope you don't experience this again) put a few drops of olive oil or groundnut oil in the ear. The insect will suffocate and die. Then you can get the ear syringed at the hospital the following day.

5383 2018-12-17 15:09:19 Like moving the embassy to Jerusalem, reducing taxes, axing needless regulation, withdrawing us from TPP and the Paris Accord, finally getting the pipelines approved and built, becoming the world's leader in oil/energy. I don't give a rat's behind whose name is on it, get it done
5384 2018-12-17 15:09:12 He should be investigated for tax fraud and shunned by every single sentient human being. He is trash. He is the christianist version of the #FakePresident. The only difference between the two is the brand of snake oil they're selling.

5386 2018-12-17 15:09:06 - I need to get a oil change 
5387 2018-12-17 15:09:04 I thought the point was the hypocrisy of opposing shipment of Alberta oil to or through Quebec while still importing oil from repressive authoritarian states.

5392 2018-12-17 15:08:52 I ran out of my *expensive* makeup remover, so I used coconut oil and OH MY GOD I have never been more impressed by something in my life. Y’all it took off waterproof mascara and a HEAVY full face. I’m super excited to save money lol 
5393 2018-12-17 15:08:45 Do you mean more climate change?  Harris, y es.   Beto gets his money from oil companies.   And one of those old white dudes is Bernie, and I support his policies.  I don't care what his gender or age is.
5394 2018-12-17 15:08:43 Shell Oil Company suspended sponsoring a TV program of a Tunisian homophobic TV host upon a campaign quite similar to the one you are proposing. It’s a great idea. People should re-educate themselves on love and humanity and revalorise their cultural n religious beliefs

Because there were oil stains on them and faulty so I compliant to the seller that Do sell what you advertise exactly!

5403 2018-12-17 15:08:01 I support free trade in general, and happy to leave import/export decisions to individual firms. The value of a pipeline is in lowering transportation costs. If all at the end of the pipe is exported, while other oil types are imported, that's okay.
5404 2018-12-17 15:07:57 To be from Texas it should smell of cow dung, oil, corn tortillas and dying dreams

5405 2018-12-17 15:07:54 This guy has been the architect of the policies like 50,000 acres of Carlesbad Cavernes being opened to FRACKING!  Our endangered species acts are being skirted and land in our National Parks is being leased or sold to oil & gas  interests.

5428 2018-12-17 15:05:46 The cost of fuel to generate electricity is approximately one third of the price of electricity. The rest is wages, distribution costs etc. This is still required whether the fuel source is fission, fusion, oil, gas or whatever.
Africa will never have energy too cheap to meter.
5429 2018-12-17 15:05:44 I like seeing oil turn negative...still has more room to drop.  Still waiting for $XOM to come into the $73 dollar range.  Be patient

5437 2018-12-17 15:05:13 I curious as to the scalability of that. How much used fry oil is there actually? (I'm actually asking, I don't know). I'm always interested in recycling like that - as long as it's economically sustainable and not just a subsidized green fantasy.
5438 2018-12-17 15:05:07 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
5439 2018-12-17 15:05:07 2/ 2) We must find a way to capture or disassemble massive amounts atmospheric CO2. And maybe 3) Find a way to cap known and emerging tundra methane sources. Make the oil/coal/gas producers pay. Yes, electricity costs will rise. But would we rather save money while house burns?

5452 2018-12-17 15:03:55 You are misinterpreting the arguement.  Quebec opposes west / east pipelines and western oil.  Imports give them the luxury of hypocrisy.  Stop imports and the pipeline and western oil becomes vitally important.  Hypocrisy hurts the country.  Imports OK if no hypocrisy.

5455 2018-12-17 15:03:26 Thanks for sharing, we really need these big supermarkets to be on board! Also thank you for all of your posts shedding the light on why stopping the production of palm oil will actually be more detrimental for our Orang-utans and our rainforests.

2. Is there a separate grill for folks with allergies where there could be no cross contamination?

5500 2018-12-17 14:59:58 I am scratching my head about this whole protest. There have been 2 oil patch slow downs, the last one occurred during Redford. Now there’s a lot of Oilfield Family videos about lack of money. Alberta is having record  growth & these guys want..?
5501 2018-12-17 14:59:55 Seems to have no problem buying Oil from them.. More Canadians out of work because of this clueless government.
5502 2018-12-17 14:59:53 When I buy a bottle of French wine that arrived at my liquor store from a distributor in Toronto it's still French wine. Quebec imports a lot of Saudi oil indirectly.

5506 2018-12-17 14:59:26 So how many barrels of oil did those applications move?
5507 2018-12-17 14:59:21 Not sure I read it that way. It seems you’re saying import of oil ahould not be contrasted with Canadian sourced oil

5510 2018-12-17 14:59:06 “Oil money” props up corrupt regimes that

-fund Salafist terrorism
-Wouldnt let you leave the house without a male relative
-Persecute christians to death

Do you actually have any values, Conservative or otherwise?
5511 2018-12-17 14:59:00 Nigga be having these foreign cars with all the damn warning lights on check engine, oil light,tires low and some more shit just to say the have a foreign car #nerdassniggas 
5512 2018-12-17 14:58:57 @CatheeMcKennnna your fight is in China, India, Arab oil.  Our country, Canada , is carbon negative.  Therefore you must lobby against the polluting countries; not tax Canada to supplement another countries’ pollution. Stop buying their goods. I have to tell you this?  #cdnpoli
5513 2018-12-17 14:58:57 So you want the federal government to dictate where private companies purchase their oil? Pretty socialist of you and still sell them arms that will end up used by ISIS?
5514 2018-12-17 14:58:56 I really brought both of my car keys to get my oil changed.. one I use that has my cute skull keychain and the other plain one that I give them because I don't want them messing with my cute skull keychain 
5515 2018-12-17 14:58:55 Ok I think I understand what you are saying. Agree that the people are very different culturally, socially etc but does that mean we cannot come together as a country. Quebec I believe is being idiotic. They can’t refuse access to the transport of oil and accept equalization.

5523 2018-12-17 14:58:07 Luckily my grandma was a woman of God. Cause I’ve seen her have her moments whe she would curse a lot and about to blow up. That woman would literally stop in her tracks and start praying and speaking in tongues. Also annoying herself with the Church oil.
5524 2018-12-17 14:57:46 Thanks to @Colts, @JimIrsay, @AnthemBCBS, @IHSAA1, and Mike Prior for and amazing experience Sunday at Lucas Oil stadium! Go Colts!
5525 2018-12-17 14:57:45 When you wake up in the morning and your bonnet on, but there's oil and product all over your pillow cases 
5526 2018-12-17 14:57:43 Well you can thank the #NAFTA agreement for that. Look it up, it's all in there. According to the agreement we MUST sell our oil to America and we MUST buy their oil. Crazy as it sounds but true. Thanks Brian #Mulroney

5531 2018-12-17 14:57:07 Even better: ethanol. It takes 2.2 gal of oil to produce 1 gal of ethanol. Savin' the world from fossil fuels, Yo.
5532 2018-12-17 14:57:06 Once Trump is gone, the Saudi’s will pay a price. They will be just another dictatorship on their way to oblivion. Once Iran sees the USA is no longer protecting them, it will be open season on regime change. Good thing the US is oil self sufficient.

5538 2018-12-17 14:56:38 And how we couldn't sustain paying for Holyrood with oil estimates of $200 per Barrell bolstered by paid for opinions of Wade Locke #nlpoli
5539 2018-12-17 14:56:32 Quebec = not caring where their oil comes from. 

Trudeau = not caring about Canada enough to get Quebec in line. 

Who in their right mind would not support Canadian resources & jobs for domestic use?!

5544 2018-12-17 14:56:06 REMEMBER 911. The Trumps are only thinking of themselves. Let the Arabia drink their oil. Time the world told them how much their oil is worth. $0.00.

5570 2018-12-17 14:53:42 why is @jamieoliver so obsessed with olive oil 
5571 2018-12-17 14:53:42 With less than 10% of our oil imports coming from Saudi Arabia and only 3000 canadian jobs tied to the arms trade with it, I think there's more to it than that. Especially given Ottawa's obsession with favoring the Aberta oil industry to the detriment of other economic sectors.
5572 2018-12-17 14:53:33 Do you people who invent Hair Remedies like "Eggs, Olive Oil and Hummus" really think I'm gonna put my breakfast in my hair. Just use shampoo and conditioner man.
5573 2018-12-17 14:53:20 This article neglects to mention that Quebec gets their oil/gas from the Saudi’s. They don’t even buy our so called “dirty oil”
But they sure love our transfer payments. What a joke! Who allowed this to happen?!?!
5574 2018-12-17 14:53:11 I'm thankful to China. We market crude oil, gas and coal to China. China is very welcoming. They would even inform us of the rules, regulations and policies. They are very friendly to Russians over the centuries. Personally, I feel very privileged.
5575 2018-12-17 14:53:11 What is that ungodly rancid burning oil smell that fills half the stadium that even the Maxwell House coffee smell can’t overpower? Wait, think I answered my own question.

5585 2018-12-17 14:52:02 You’re being persecuted because you’ve done these things - refused emoluments clause - refused to show your taxes. You’re Nothing but a two bit snake oil salesman. who conned a slew of people in this country; they thought you would help the country. Not tear it apart.
5586 2018-12-17 14:51:52 Now, if @PepsiCo would stop using palm oil that destroys habitats and kills off species daily - as well as the insane amount of human rights violations by the suppliers they choose for it - maybe they could be listened to.  Until then, they are a worthless company.
5587 2018-12-17 14:51:49 See what happens when you whisper in the ears of other World leaders? Those countries hate you so much that when those presidents try to be a thief like you they revolt. Because they know these taxes are filling the wallets of the elite and oil companies.
5588 2018-12-17 14:51:42 Listen, don’t make this a very big issue.
Raise prices or tax anything going there. Let them feel the punch of buying anything they felt they didn’t need.
Look, people don’t realize how much something means until you take it away. Hurt them w/o hurting them. #quebec #oil #gas #AB

5591 2018-12-17 14:51:20 Do you think the government should dictate supply agreements to private businesses?
If you think the government should tell oil refineries whose oil to buy, should the government tell restaurants which beef to buy?

5595 2018-12-17 14:51:05 Without widespread electrification of transport, heating and industry, there is no substitution between oil and renewables. I fully support an energy transition for Canada, but it won't happen without changing demand patterns - instead of constantly focusing on supply.

5599 2018-12-17 14:50:51 
5600 2018-12-17 14:50:40 :))) i am pouring oil
5601 2018-12-17 14:50:38 It destroys rainforests. Yes. But to produce the same amount of oil out of alternatives like soy destroys even more land because they're not as profitable. So the key to this problem is to make palm oil production as sustainable as possible.
5602 2018-12-17 14:50:35 You’re a damn lieif I wouldn’t have told you it was aloe your dumbass would’ve kept oil
5603 2018-12-17 14:50:35 There has to been some value there somewhere. The world won't be oil free tomorrow...

5614 2018-12-17 14:49:15 He would shudder feeling her tail enjoying the feeling on his body watching the soap on his body bubble, he then feels her breasts press against his back enjoying her rubbing of her soap like oil.

5618 2018-12-17 14:49:12 Yes, "former Gulf War pilot" is suddenly an expert on international law  and understands complex legal documents.

5625 2018-12-17 14:48:52 You said you had a plan. We’re waiting. Just another in a long series of lies. Charlatan, selling snake oil.
5626 2018-12-17 14:48:50 I think you are making my point.  Publicly traded companies can only short-term plan.  They are not set up to be true explorers, just exploiters.  Now that oil is tougher to bring to market they are forced to eat their own tail.

5648 2018-12-17 14:46:46 I agree with the pledge. I also remember Joe 4 Oil commercials so forgive me if I don’t trust you or your buddies.

5665 2018-12-17 14:45:15 Quebec does not import Saudi's oil...
5666 2018-12-17 14:45:03 It was disgusting. Lip service and repeating - we support Alberta - is not actually supporting Alberta. He just childishly blamed the previous government. Ban all imports on oil from foreign countries and have Canada use Canadian resources.
5667 2018-12-17 14:44:59 The oil citadel of Israel is falling apart as climate change destroys the planet.  Desperation sets in by those invested.

5680 2018-12-17 14:43:29 I would feel very sad if that contract should fall through. I am hoping some smart person can find another buyer. Buying Saudi oil costs all Canadians dearly. And while the number for London is big, we send between 3 and 4 billion, a year, to them for oil.

5686 2018-12-17 14:42:45 Not a good news but the discontinuation of the Federal EV tax credit is not going to kill the EV industry.  Same applies to an oil price of 50 USD per barrel.
5687 2018-12-17 14:42:44 No oil...
5688 2018-12-17 14:42:25 Meh. Most of these comments are angry people out Alberta all buthurt about dropping oil prices taking it out on potheads. #notworried #Trudeau  is better than ass hat #harper ever was.
5689 2018-12-17 14:42:22 A result will be less kow-towing to questionable regimes because of oil export leverage. Also, less support for US oil companies in pursuing external reserves.

Whether by extension this means less soft power projection I think will depend on the American public.

5699 2018-12-17 14:42:06 I’m too prideful to have her insulting my hair in that salon. But yeh she always gives me an oil treatment after a deep wash
5700 2018-12-17 14:42:03 be very generous with the oil application and dont use soap to wash it off !.
5701 2018-12-17 14:41:39 They don't use Saudi oil in PQ Those good socialists, the Irvings, use saudi oil
5702 2018-12-17 14:41:37 The oil spec should all be the same, but don't for example @Castrol produce oil specifically for short distances (if that is the actual issue?). Sounds like a lot of buck shifting to me..
5703 2018-12-17 14:41:29 I almost never stress about money until I’m getting my oil changed and idk why!!!!!! And then I just sit here with nowhere to go stressing myself out! Wow! Fun!
5704 2018-12-17 14:41:25 Someone told me yesterday a man will always chase a dream because he can’t get back the dream that he lost. What I don’t understand is why not try to fix your wrong instead of putting yourself in my heart ache. The power of pride will have you in a head space of term oil.

5706 2018-12-17 14:41:08 Article is bullshit. Yes they will stay. But only to protect the oil co. Already taking oil via Dick Cheney’s Genie and of course Israel is also. These wars have nothing to do with stabilizing the country! All about oil industry. Oh let’s not forget the nat gas pipeline.

5711 2018-12-17 14:40:48 They need to stop subsidizing the OIL INDUSTRY if they where wanting to make a difference
5712 2018-12-17 14:40:46 I’ve heard it’s great but here’s something else that helps me maintain smooth clear skin.

Make a mix of vitamin c serum, tea tree oil, eucalyptus oil, and almond oil and apply to ur face after washing it everyday (ur skin will absorb it and not stay oily)
5713 2018-12-17 14:40:43 Here's an economics lesson: in fifty years, when electric cars finally make up 50 of all cars on the road, the cheap price of oil will result in MORE oil being used for alternative uses--NOT LESS.

5720 2018-12-17 14:40:14 Canada doesn't buy any oil, from anywhere. Oil companies buy oil, should we nationalize the oil industry? Isn't that socialism? What crap you people  spout
5721 2018-12-17 14:40:12 oh yeah. Hordes of people jaywalking, cyclists randomly cutting in front of you and no speed limit!

our taxi driver was not afraid to ram into the oil tank truck in front of us. I thought I was gonna die right there.
5722 2018-12-17 14:40:12 Mint oil, rubbed just below your nose and wrist helps the best for me.  It opens your airways and reminds you to breathe before you can tell yourself. PLUS you'll smell so bomb that you'll be feeling yourself all day.

5785 2018-12-17 14:33:24 And the shrinking Arctic ice mass makes it easier to access the oil. So of course he is all for global warming.
5786 2018-12-17 14:33:22 Derelict oil drilling platform?
5787 2018-12-17 14:33:11 Around 60COS is close to shooting the fish in the barrel

Plus this is gCOS not cCOS

Completely different

Commercial is the word you need to see

Flowrates of 500bopd from r and mengo will make it commercial

Djeno commercial oil strike will see the sp to the moon
5788 2018-12-17 14:33:02 We released a report last week at the U.N. climate conference with two big conclusions: Expanding oil and gas production is undermining Canada’s ability to be a climate leader. And oil executives are successfully weakening and delaying Canadian climate change policies.
5789 2018-12-17 14:33:02 BETTER EDUCATION!!
If the general public was given a quality education we wouldn't fall victim to every snake oil salesmen promising impossibilities. 
Also, our society would have far less prejudices and hate(those come from ignorance).
"They" keep the populous stupid on purpose!
5790 2018-12-17 14:33:02 Where did they hide the snake oil?
5791 2018-12-17 14:32:51 Wow, David Bernhardt, former oil lobbyist to head the Interior Department. It that doesn't smell of Trump's kleptocracy, I don't know what does.
5792 2018-12-17 14:32:42 Sweet. My birthday present to myself this year was an oil change for my 16 yo car. Yay.
5793 2018-12-17 14:32:36 Great. Another oil schmuck. Bye bye environment!
5794 2018-12-17 14:32:25 Does frying chicken in sunflower oil make it vegetarian?
5795 2018-12-17 14:32:10 Mostly US oil.  Maybe Quebec should just join the US.  Then maybe they'll get an NHL team.
5796 2018-12-17 14:32:05 No, Saudi oil gets refined in NB and sold in the US. Most QC gas comes from Suncor and Petrocan, not Irving
5797 2018-12-17 14:31:52 I am wondering, what is with the oil can and the sign post on the guys head.
5798 2018-12-17 14:31:47 8 lb beef tenderloin.  Smear it with olive oil, lots of S&P and put it on a baking rack.  Preheat oven to 500*.  Bake for 3 min per pound, 24 min. Turn off oven and walk away DO NOT open door for 1 hour for perfect medium rare.
5799 2018-12-17 14:31:43 Trudeau doesn't buy the oil.  Canadian refineries choose where to buy the oil they need.  You'll have to dream up some other lie.
5800 2018-12-17 14:31:39 Energy East would reduce Canada’s emissions by 6.2% how about we start with that? Getting our Gas and Oil to Asian Markets will also reduce global emmisions because of the way we produce it! Greenest Most Ethical Period!
5801 2018-12-17 14:31:37 Over the last five years my sources of polyphenols have all been delicious, multiple health benefits, and fit in nicely with my low carb base: coffee, green tea, 85%+ dark chocolate, cocoa, organic wild blueberries, olive oil.
5802 2018-12-17 14:31:29 I thought fries were bad for you because they're fried in grease/fat??? Like, you *could* use vegetable oil I guess but most fast food places don't do they? I thought that's why fries were bad for you.
5803 2018-12-17 14:31:27 A. The new trendy oil that can cure everything and fix your hair

B. Probably proof that feminists hate nerds and don't care about campus rape somehow
5804 2018-12-17 14:31:05 Western Canadian oil is banned from eastern Canada, so should everyone elses.
5805 2018-12-17 14:30:58 Yep i knew oil was different but I didn’t know 2 kinds 
Holland and Barrett sell one kind but apparently thats not suitable for chronic pain or fatigue but for less serious pain or temporary illness
5806 2018-12-17 14:30:56 We're glad your asked. All travelers must comply w/ federal law on transporting marijuana & cannabis infused products, such as CBD oil, on board a flight. Our officers are required to notify law enforcement officers if they discover these products while screening your property.

5820 2018-12-17 14:28:39 Just abolish insurance period it's the biggest scam ever perpetuated against the American people . You want free health care use the oil drilled in the United States to pay for it , according to Ronald Regan that oil belongs to the people

5824 2018-12-17 14:28:24 one of my FAVORITE St. Therese quotes!

5832 2018-12-17 14:27:29 Paul Ryan is a snake oil salesman... a liar... and a charlatan... the only thing he has ever been good at is raising money from donors and then looking after their money... he has performed as an enemy of everyone but the 1 pct.

5838 2018-12-17 14:27:12 I have a coupon to get my car serviced, but it expires this month & they told me not to bring my car in till my oil is at 15%. it's at 30.
5839 2018-12-17 14:27:11 Suncor's a private company; the QC government doesn't tell it where to buy its oil.
5840 2018-12-17 14:27:07 Quebec is awash in foreign Oil . Quebec needs oil to survive.
5841 2018-12-17 14:27:02 you flattered to deceive Darian, its a lucky draw not a give away. I am fine with my parachute coconut oil. Thanks :)
5842 2018-12-17 14:26:52 You have not released your taxes as you promised.
Your inauguration committee can account for 40 million donor dollars.
Our president is under countless investigations.
Our president is selling off public lands to oil companies.
Our president is attacking the US constitution.
5843 2018-12-17 14:26:48 And yet we could have 100% of Canadian oil.
5844 2018-12-17 14:26:30 @realDonaldTrump The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one of America's last untouched pieces of wilderness. The Trump Administration is rushing to open it up to oil companies. #YEARSproject Why would u do this???????
5845 2018-12-17 14:26:19 Mostly depends on who the "perps" align with and if they happen to be located on "our" oil.
5846 2018-12-17 14:26:18 Finally got here early enough to do this oil change without a long ass fuckin wait 
5847 2018-12-17 14:26:13 Scotland could use the remaining oil & gas to invest for the benefit of current & future generations, like Norway, unlike #wasteminster
5848 2018-12-17 14:26:13 Ummm well Quebec doesn’t buy oil from Saudi Arabia.....

5850 2018-12-17 14:26:12 This AB separation bullshit comes up every time oil takes a nosedive. the only difference this time its on Facebook and Twitter instead of just chatter at the local cafe and opinion pieces in Alberta Report. The facts don’t change, just the medium
5851 2018-12-17 14:26:08 i was watching a 20/20 last night and it really showed me how idiotic the human race can be. why in the world would you throw 2 innocent children in an oil tank and bury your wife in the middle of the desert. 
5852 2018-12-17 14:26:04 Like Ontario paying 3 x power $?  Germany going back to coal and dealing with inflated power?  I think not.  There are hundreds of new coal plants being built today.   Oil demand now over 100 million per day and growing.   Where do you work?  Do my tax dollars pay your salary?
5853 2018-12-17 14:25:48 We didn't need englands tea and we do not need the Arabs oil. Send those old bones to the graveyrd. Please join in boycotting Chevron and Shell gas.  Shop local. Support the America  the beautiful that we love! If you have $$ buy hybrids, go solar.

Harper stacked NEB w oil industry rep who FAILED "duty 2 consult First Nations". That's why it's been stalled.

5866 2018-12-17 14:25:19 I think the world owes the countries of the middle east an apology for ever going there to exploit their oil.
5867 2018-12-17 14:25:18 Cathy, here position on oil and in particular the oil sands was against before she became premier.  Now she is fighting for oil. I could buy a change of heart, if she and the NDP did not follow the Leap Manifesto.
5868 2018-12-17 14:25:07 Thinking the same. Just putting some oil on that bullish fire 
5869 2018-12-17 14:25:05 Jeez that looks amazing. Do you know by any chance... are the chips cooked in separate oil from the dead stuff and did they have a good understanding of Veganfood?

5880 2018-12-17 14:23:23 Hi Kerry, great to see you're an ethically minded consumer looking to reduce your impact on the environment. Palm oil is a complex issue with no simple answer, but it's important to note that the crop itself isn't the issue - it's the way it's produced. (1/2)
5881 2018-12-17 14:23:20 Never heard of that one. Clonazepam is my epilepsy drug. Taken with baclofen, gabapentin, cannabis oil, it is kept in check!
5882 2018-12-17 14:23:12 I’ve been experimenting with watercolors and inks lately - holy guacamole is it different than oil painting. I’m loving how it’s forcing me to approach a piece in a completely different manner.

5889 2018-12-17 14:22:35 Tea tree oil is amazing but make sure it’s diluted. Put a few drops in a carrier oil like olive oil or jojoba. Otherwise, it can be too strong for skin and make the problem worse

5898 2018-12-17 14:21:44 Baby boy Venezuela and Russia are not under any trade sanctions. The common denominator for these countries is that they are all Oil producing countries. U can also read about Saudi Arabia and oil price crash. Use Google young man.
5899 2018-12-17 14:21:38 Let me mess my car with oil for the gram
5900 2018-12-17 14:21:34 If Saudi oil represents 10% of Canada's total oil usage, anyone calling for Canadian oil to replace it, and not renewables, is either a fool or making money from the industry.

5902 2018-12-17 14:21:24 Stop reminiscing about the good old days when we made and wasted $10k a month during the oil boom. Stop being victims and adjust to the new reality. There’s jobs out there but it seems some would rather cry and blame someone else.
5903 2018-12-17 14:21:22 Haha the first one was a flunk but, I added oil to the pan and semi fried them and it turned out awesome! Way to sweet though 
5904 2018-12-17 14:21:21 @ABPrimetime Most certainly should support more refining in AB. BC Premier has said he would support upgraded oil in pipelines. More Upgraders and Refineries means jobs. BUT need much better leadership in project management. Doing as always done, (huge cost overuns) unacceptable.

5999 2018-12-17 14:12:55 Well that shows what you know about the subject, heavy oil is the main feedstock for asphalt in North America.

6017 2018-12-17 14:11:32 When daddy was in the car complaining how he needed an oil change I’m sure this isn’t what he had in mind lol. Their faces are priceless & thank god they are ok
6018 2018-12-17 14:11:26 1/3 We apologize for the inconvenience with the oil leaking. It is normal over time, if not used on a regular basis that some oil can settle and separate causing it to leak out. Unless the mixer has lost a fairly large amount of oil (¼ cup or more) this is likely not a concern.
6019 2018-12-17 14:11:23 The green energy lobby has no money, it's all in the future. Whereas oil is so cash rich it can get wars fought for oil deposits. We need green energy QE in the double figures trillions $ to create a market that reflects our democratic interest in future energy policy #GoGreen

6052 2018-12-17 14:07:59 I don’t advocate that Alberta leave the oil and gas industry. That would be stupid. What I DO advocate is acknowledging that the world is changing. Sticking our heads in the sand and pretending change isn’t happening is also stupid.

6074 2018-12-17 14:05:45 Alberta has a history of separatist talk, whenever the oil price went down.
6075 2018-12-17 14:05:41 Someone down east is buying Saudi oil - they are using blood oil.  There is no moral high ground in supporting a thug, authoritarian dictatorship.  But what the hey, be happy with your complicity.

6085 2018-12-17 14:03:44 No dear except maybe you have extremely dry skin. Coconut oil can clog the pores.
6086 2018-12-17 14:03:37 So you are saying the government has USD but it just doesnt want to pay it to workers?...Shortage of bread, fuel, drinks, cooking oil etc ...all need forex and its not there

6088 2018-12-17 14:03:20 Why would a country sitting atop an ocean of oil and with no shortage of sunlight or acreage to put solar installations need a nuclear plant? Could it be...gasp, cover for other nuclear aspirations? 
6089 2018-12-17 14:03:19 Bullocks!
You do realize dat the main problem of d country's economy started with d fall in oil prices on d international market? 
And dat was totally out of our hands. 
Less foreign exchange = lower currency value. 
You gotta sell something (material/service/time) to make cash.

6112 2018-12-17 14:01:13 Still 80,000 barrels/day from Saudi Arabia. And your Govt is apparently willing to keep on importing Saudi oil while cancelling the armoured vehicle contract with the Saudis which will cost as many high-paying middle class jobs as the GM Oshawa closure! Shameful! @AndrewScheer
6113 2018-12-17 14:00:56 Who and where should he send the memo to?

He killed every single leader. He routed them from every single territory they held possessions in.

ISIS under Obama had captured lands, banks, oil fields. under Trump none of those any longer.

Toadying up to the EU behind the back of the UK government, with the sole intention of undermining the process.

6118 2018-12-17 14:00:41 Alberta is Quebec with oil. Alberta has always had a sense of entitlement along with a strange persecution complex. They’ve demanded special treatment and told the rest of Canada to screw off in good times, then wonder why they don’t rush to help in bad.

6165 2018-12-17 13:55:46 In the 1980's farmers were producing so much produce that the excess was stored across Europe. There was literally mountains of grain, cheese, butter,apples lakes of milk, wine, olive oil etc. That's why today farmers are paid to not farm part of their land it's called set aside.

6192 2018-12-17 13:53:45 I see your point.
Now do maple syrup. On that commodity, Quebec definitely has an opinion which is pretty similar to Alberta's opinion on oil. So much so that it specifically was a federal tariff item issue this past summer.
6193 2018-12-17 13:53:37 Did you hear of Ribadu's international award recently? He fought corruption using EFCC established by the PDP! As he was fighting corruption the economy was growing even though oil prices were less than 30 dpb at a time.
6194 2018-12-17 13:53:27 Frying also isn’t scary, you just gotta learn that perfect technique to make sure that the oil doesn’t go everywhere

6208 2018-12-17 13:52:36 thanks! Chanee from Kalaweit discovered a population of 100 orangutans trapped in 1500 ha by palm oil and coal factories in Kalimantan. The only way to save them is to create a reserve by buying forests...

6210 2018-12-17 13:52:09 You could also put a drop or 2 of the essential oil in some plain lotion & apply where needed.

Just 1 or 2 drops in a tablespoon of some plain lotion!

6217 2018-12-17 13:51:54 The dark answer is to assure survivability long into the future. We must relinquish almost everything we know as normal now. No more plastic, no more fingernail polish remover, hand sanitizers, all of these things and their containers are made from oil derivatives.(2)

6221 2018-12-17 13:51:37 Quick and inexpensive place to do a car oil change in Guildford or Godalming?
6222 2018-12-17 13:51:18 Thank you! To help them grow back I’ve used coconut oil, castor oil, and olive oil. Last night I also used an Anastasia Beverly Hills brow pen to fill in the areas that are thinner.
6223 2018-12-17 13:51:16 Damn gotta do an oil change
6224 2018-12-17 13:51:07 Snake oil salesman, not journalist!
6225 2018-12-17 13:51:03 Take vitamins use coconut oil and drink lots of water
6226 2018-12-17 13:51:03 Simpler, we should all be responsible for our own trash on a local level. The plastics companies need to help with the machine that can break down plastic into oil. At home cut back where you can, no more water bottles, reusable aluminum water jugs. Local politicians need 2 know
6227 2018-12-17 13:51:01 When has Hama's and Hezbollah been the enemies of the UK?
ISIS was financed by Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. Ever wondered where they got there shiny new SUVs they used to drive around in convoys of up to 100, the USA. Ever wondered how they could sell $m per week of oil to Isael?

6229 2018-12-17 13:50:50 Symantics. We need to stop polluting, everyone except the oil & power lobby and their puppets agree on that. Measuring CO2 levels is not ideal but reflects general pollution. What do you suggest we measure to give indication of pollution levels?
6230 2018-12-17 13:50:49 A government shutdown is akin to a giant oil spill (leak) turning off for 10 minutes.
6231 2018-12-17 13:50:43 I never implied that u were lying, $130 just seems wild to me for an oil change
6232 2018-12-17 13:50:38 No moral compass or ethics he supports human rights violations in Cuba and unethical oil from SA! Will our military call groper treasonous like the French military called marcon? Groper truely hates Canadians and Canada!

6234 2018-12-17 13:50:29 They’re keen on preserving relations with the United States because we are keeping that miserable clan above water and out of prison.
Saudi Arabia government is near collapse. Their oil wells are running out of oil. 
It’s all over except for the shouting.

6242 2018-12-17 13:49:47 Yang koplak ente.

Masa depan CPO suram karena dihambat UE dengan alasan lingkungan dsb, selain proteksi minyak nabati mereka sendiri (sunflower, corn oil).

6250 2018-12-17 13:49:10 What does the WWF have to do with the business of obtaining and exporting oil? NOTHING! Their job is to protect WILDLIFE like polar bears and sh1t, and not to hinder people from getting the oil products that they need! That pipeline needs to be built - it's been WAYYY too long!!!
6251 2018-12-17 13:49:06 I don’t understand Trevor’s comments. US oil imports costs us C$1.30. Canadian oil costs C$1.00. If pipelines displace US oil, we’re $.30 ahead. And, the entire C$1.00 stays in Canada.
6252 2018-12-17 13:49:00 A positive environment surrounds Mexico's president, #AMLO, following the oil and gas production plans for the next 6 years and the budget for 2019.

6272 2018-12-17 13:47:25 The case in which the author changes his argument from “we don’t import Saudi oil” to “imports aren’t bad”

6285 2018-12-17 13:46:00 It’s not really fair to go after Irving in the argument.  Irving shipped a huge amount of western oil east to its refinery until the Lac Magetic disaster (oil owned by Irving). If Irving had a safer way to access Western Canadian crude, you can bet it would be all they would use.
6286 2018-12-17 13:45:57 People in Sayaxche say that the lack of land to cultivate has forced many to migrate. Yes there are many factors... but the consolidation of land holdings for palm oil is one of them.
6287 2018-12-17 13:45:50 BS, you miss lead on purpose.  

Saudi oil gets refined in NB, then goes to Quebec.
6288 2018-12-17 13:45:47 Actually that is incorrect. Quebec has imported over $50 million in oil from Saudi Arabia, in 2018 alone.

6298 2018-12-17 13:44:45 Crude oil fell during the week, closing 2.68% lower at USD51.07 per barrel. In the Asian session, at GMT0600, the black metal is trading at USD51.26 per barrel, marginally higher from the New York close...

6300 2018-12-17 13:44:28 Yes, both seem very oversold but so much negativity in the market and oil price very weak.

6304 2018-12-17 13:44:13 Time to buy some oil too?
6305 2018-12-17 13:44:12 Another conman. Just like most preachers/televangelists. The business of God is indeed very lucrative. I don't know who deserves to take the blame more, these snake oil salesmen, or the idiots that keep sending them money. Wake up, people!!!

6317 2018-12-17 13:43:23 It was long before that, because Getty basically had to govern in one long recession. Let the Eastern Bastards Freeze in the Dark was about the disastrous NEP which mandated Alberta had to sell its oil at half the world price to the rest of Canada.  People were mad.
6318 2018-12-17 13:42:53 Frankie Five Fingers should go preach in Ebola Africa where he could possibly get into the corruption there with natural resources like gold and oil. I'm sure he's immune to infection as he is a follower of Morningstar
6319 2018-12-17 13:42:52 Also FWIW Europe shouldn't be buying oil and gas from Putin regime used to support violence of Assad in Syria or Putin aggression against Ukraine. So energy independence is a fundamental platform of all Western security.

'Woohoo, at that mileage we'll get extra £750 out of him over the 3 years as he'll be back for oil changes every 9 months.'

6365 2018-12-17 13:37:09 How do oil spills affect aquatic ecosystems? In EE, fourth graders work in teams to clean water and wildlife affected by an oil spill.

6371 2018-12-17 13:36:20 Obviously we have a much larger footprint by bringing oil from anywhere outside Canada. It is just that simple. The liberal views are just not researched.
6372 2018-12-17 13:36:07 Amen.
6373 2018-12-17 13:35:58 Jojoba oil?
6374 2018-12-17 13:35:49 yeah in the US it's Paradise thanks to you, and it's juste the beginning. Climate change's impacts will probably be exponential, and peak oil is gonna affect (destroy ?) global economy. 
But some people juste want to watch the World Burn I guess ;(
6375 2018-12-17 13:35:49 Never invite a Vampire into your home to live. Oil and Water don't mix. E.U. stands for Evil Union. It's not to late for European countries to take back their countries. But it has to start now. I pray for the great citizens of Italy to Make Italy Whole Again and Great Again.
6376 2018-12-17 13:35:45 #aaog "The salt cap is firmly in place and the oil doesn’t seem to have migrated out of the location. This will be 100% confirmed in the wirelogging, but removes a component of the Mengo COS calculation, raising this to around 80%."
6377 2018-12-17 13:35:33 You know what I think Mandy..too many tankers mixed with wankers here 
6378 2018-12-17 13:35:33 To clarify, diesel fuel costs are artificially high as the process and oil to make diesel is the same as making gas. A glut of gas and shortage of diesel means refiners are purposefully reducing diesel being refined to keep prices high in a segment less price-sensitive than gas.
6379 2018-12-17 13:35:29 I just ordered some Solomon's Reserve beard oil from @BankersBest. I'm looking forward to supporting a brother's business, as well as the @WhenceCameYou Podcast. I encourage all brothers to check both out.

6390 2018-12-17 13:34:02 Lmao, sure, because despite the hard public lobbying from oil companies and  industry groups, suddenly, none of them want that particular pipeline.  I guess facts and data are not things you consider when analyzing this issue if it violates your confirmation bias.
6391 2018-12-17 13:33:59 China keeps setting new monthly trade imbalance records with US, not in a good way. GM is closing plants, moving more manufacturing offshore. All end users of steel in the US have to pay your tariff price even 4 domestically produced steel. Low oil prices is an economic warning..
6392 2018-12-17 13:33:59 Create a human capital index and have it change with inflation GDP.  Even trade shares on the open market.  Stop relying on Congress to pass a bill.  If we can determine the international price of a barrel of oil, we can derive the per hour minimum for a human asset.

6394 2018-12-17 13:33:49 Don't believe this misleading info. This just shows raw oil imports. Not refined product imports. Dig deeper.
6395 2018-12-17 13:33:47 A few of PYO's lies:

2. Domestic rice production is 90% of consumption
3. Nigeria is among "world's top ten performing economies"
4. Tried to lie about PMS subsidy payments, but forced to admit NNPC pays illegally
PYO is a LIAR
6396 2018-12-17 13:33:47 In my opinion climate activists need to realize there’s a powerful coalition behind car culture that has the ability to halt progress on climate change, & it *is neither the oil industry nor car industry* - but our neighbors who don’t want more neighbors, or buses, or bike lanes.

Nope, £220 to me. 
6407 2018-12-17 13:32:32 The issue isn’t overconfidence, it’s lying to oneself. Brexit was a fantasy sold by snake oil salesman in pursuit of profit for their backers. The people were lied too and fooled into believing this was their fight.

6409 2018-12-17 13:32:25 Admittedly a bad rationale. It would have been better to say “Climate change presents an existential threat to human civilization, so we’ve decided to end pipeline construction and oil production altogether. Instead we’re investing everything in green energy sources.”
6410 2018-12-17 13:32:17 I double cleanse my face first with coconut oil then a gel cleanser. Then I make sure all my makeup is off my using micellar water and toner. Then I used a snail sheet mask for like 20 minutes. After the mask i make sure all the serum dries then I use hylauanic acid serum

6420 2018-12-17 13:30:53 Inflation adjusted by whom? First you would have to be honest about inflation to adjust by inflation.. what is the price of gold in oil over this time?
6421 2018-12-17 13:30:51 If that's true & the Quebec people support an EE pipeline then they need to send a strong message to their politicians. But out west all we're hearing is Quebecers prefer the OPEC oil over ours. They should visit a Saudi oilfield sometime to see how green they are.

If I were u I was gonna quickly take them to hospital for check up because they might have swallowed some, not to forget skin rash.This is your mistake,how can u not check your kids while playing outside
6439 2018-12-17 13:28:29 Ju$tin Trudeau Prime Minister of Canada who promotes himself as a Feminist  buys Saudi oil. I do not expect either he or his government will comment on this.  IMO
6440 2018-12-17 13:28:28 Venezuela has the richest oil reserves. It was the lunacy of the reckless socialist gov which caused their travesty. A travesty which corbyn celebrates.

And loads more than half LD membership left labour because of Brexit. So stop spreading lies.
6441 2018-12-17 13:28:06 yes, stop buying oil too!! isn't smarter?
6442 2018-12-17 13:27:58 Hmmm I'm going to default to the @motormouthradio guys on this one. But I think, yes, the cooler the oil going to the supercharger, the better.

6446 2018-12-17 13:27:38 Now how can I make my home heating oil last like that? Put a good word in for me. :)
6447 2018-12-17 13:27:34 Totally misleading. Post the facts of not how much raw oil Quebec imports - but how much refined oil product they bring in that's imported. You're bending the truth.
6448 2018-12-17 13:27:28 There’s a story here. Fuel costs are artificially high, hitting diesel trucks, trains. Gas/diesel made from same crude oil at same time. But most diesel used for transporting goods vs direct consumer, so there’s little pressure to push costs down-passing it to consumers via goods
6449 2018-12-17 13:27:24 With all of the United States Department of State, will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted.

6450 2018-12-17 13:26:56 Axios about the only outlet that has reported the potential impact on the BPCIA - regrettably there are policy makers and staff who think BPCIA is a conspiracy between an oil company and an intelligence agency
6451 2018-12-17 13:26:56 Work was so busy, just not cool. Steaming hot shower, scrubbed off what felt like a deep fryer's worth of oil, enjoyed a Corona now, collapsing on to an electric blanket.
6452 2018-12-17 13:26:47 1. Private oil companies buy and sell oil.  Eastern Canada does not.
2. You realize that oil bought from Canadian sources will not show as an import?
6453 2018-12-17 13:26:44 A big oil CEO built a home in Florida  some years ago on the ocean. Hurricane came through and destroyed his home. It now sits 80 ft. from shore due to raising ocean levels. Karma?
6454 2018-12-17 13:26:42 Hey Anchal Cooking Oil(@AjantaCares), thank you for following me
6455 2018-12-17 13:26:37 The cost is less if you calculate environmental impact of fossil fuels. Next to it Hydrolysis is a process that stores energy, the energy loss is far less then the current fraction of oil into Petrol/Diesel. There is no excuse not to implement this technology.
6456 2018-12-17 13:26:37 Are they using hot oil system instead of boilers?
6457 2018-12-17 13:26:35 Why did Alberta not build the "Trans Canada Pipeline" to the Atlantic 60 years ago? Now the only reason they want the pipeline is to EXPORT oil! Not to supply Quebec/Atlantic Can. with oil.

6466 2018-12-17 13:25:36 Two corrupt politicians one in the pocket of mnuchin and the other in the pocket of big oil are your two fucking choices? 

Obviously you are choosing not on policy put on identity. Because these two don't talk about policy. 


6467 2018-12-17 13:25:33 So when does you plan B,C,D take affect or is it already creating work for Canadians? If your plan B is up and going let people know so we can get Canadians back to work! Also the Lithium for Tesla Batteries is mined with equipment which needs oil, Saudi oil you would prefer.

It is all about substitutions.  
- Add 2x melted butter in lieu of oil.
- Add five smallish eggs in lieu of 3 eggs.
- One box of jello pudding.
Now, these kinds of cakes are for busy people who like the taste/texture of boxed cakes & don't take baking risk

6596 2018-12-17 13:11:56 7:11 AM on my off day and my mom waking me up to go outside in the cold to check her oil and put some anti freezer in the carshould have let me show youand gone get mad when I caught an attitude! Mofo it’s cold asf outchea 
6597 2018-12-17 13:11:48 Really?  Its a deflection to point out that the US is now the largest producer of oil and no longer needs alberta oil, or that india and China have contracts that fill their demand, or Nigeria, Equador, Brazil all have new projects up and running, not to mention China?
6598 2018-12-17 13:11:43 ありがとう！！！！

6601 2018-12-17 13:11:03 The way I dread oil
6602 2018-12-17 13:11:01 Tweeting to remind myself to get an oil change today
6603 2018-12-17 13:10:56 Every pipeline that supplies natural gas and oil runs through Syria, and that explains it .
6604 2018-12-17 13:10:56 
6605 2018-12-17 13:10:51 I will use this to say : Palm oil and artificial sweeteners are ruining chocolates and other sweets (and drinks)!

6609 2018-12-17 13:10:18 This blueberry oil make my locs smell like heaven
6610 2018-12-17 13:10:15 I think stopping the wonderful machine of democracy every once in a while to let a mechanic check it and change the oil etc. is a normal part of its life cycle. At least history suggests so.
6611 2018-12-17 13:10:14 This speaks volume, these people are only concerned about themselves.
6612 2018-12-17 13:10:10 人に会うたびに膨らんだって言われるけど、明日氷河期が来たら生き残るのは僕だよ。
6613 2018-12-17 13:10:10 Hurricanes should be named after oil companies. Their fossil fuels are causing Climate change.
6614 2018-12-17 13:09:52 I would scrap all the add ons and have everyone and every business on pay as you earn ie. Tax on earnings.
Back of a day packet calculations works out about 5% for all.
Imagine Amazon paying on earnings 
Imagine Ineos paying on earnings 
Imgaine oil industry 
No deductions
6615 2018-12-17 13:09:44 I get that Rob, believe or not we're not arguing We're simply have a convo via twitter. It's all good. Hitch had a great comment about "lack of effort" He said it's generally the opposite, trying to hard, do too much and play for oneself.
6616 2018-12-17 13:09:40 Do they? Butts was pretty adamant yesterday to retweet a tweet stating Quebec buys 0 oil from Saudi.
6617 2018-12-17 13:09:39 So now they’re getting an ex oil lobbyist?
6618 2018-12-17 13:09:38 They should also be made aware & involved in the permitting process. I don’t have an easement, but it’s across the street from me. I have never received anything from Sunoco our state specific to the Mariner East project. It’s almost like our gov’t is on the side of oil & gas.
6619 2018-12-17 13:09:35 Canada: Subsidize not oil; divert oil $$$ to solar, wind, battery storage; refine existing oil to finished local products; protect green belts over urban growth; replenish, protect natural species forests, wetlands, grasslands, WATER; resettle millions more climate refugees. Y/N?
6620 2018-12-17 13:09:31 Looked more like he uses a whale oil hair gel doesn't it?
6621 2018-12-17 13:09:08 Saudi Arabia has gotten away with horrific human rights,beheadings,911, the Genocide in Yemen,the murder of a journalist & our Govs. continue to turn the other way while condemning countries that are no where near as bad as this..is it the oil?
6622 2018-12-17 13:08:48 まずい、主力のNK/DJで負けてOilで取り返す展開。最近は相場を読めてなさすぎる。
6623 2018-12-17 13:08:40 Also, help end the oil gas and pipeline wars before its too late. No more wars for genie energy, Exxon, ect.
6624 2018-12-17 13:08:39 Quite right!
6625 2018-12-17 13:08:37 Olive-oil-and-salt Nothing-much. I don’t think this one has been thought through.
6626 2018-12-17 13:08:23 Maduro isn't communist, he's socialist. The government have nationalized the oil fields, meaning the government owns them. That is socialism.

6628 2018-12-17 13:08:16 Egypt's GASC is seeking at least 30,000 tonnes of soyoil and 10,000 tonnes of sunflower oil. The agency will also accept offers of at least 10,000 tonnes of soyoil and 5,000 tonnes of sunflower oil in Egyptian pounds.

6635 2018-12-17 13:07:55 It's closer to 1 in 4 actually. 100 mln bbl/d x 365 d/yr is around 36 bln bbl per year. Conventional exploration finds (oil and gas combined) is around 9 bln boe. See Rystad article. Hence 1 in 4. And roughly half of the 1 boe is gas.
6636 2018-12-17 13:07:52 yet he still buys their oil. I bet China would love to pick up the Saudi defense contracts anyhow. Trudeau and the CBC want us isolated.
6637 2018-12-17 13:07:50 Another sneak peek... "View on 9th, early Spring" an 11x 14 oil on linen, framed.  Maggie Capettini's painting was inspired by an historic post card with the same view.  The knife painting was created as part of unLOCK:  Merging Art and Industry in downtown Lockport, 2018.
6638 2018-12-17 13:07:46 for all our talk of coal, and the richest vein the world has ever seen or will of anthracite coal is right there under north central pa, to say nothing of the bituminous fields out towards the alleghenies, we often forget that the commonwealth gave us oil, too
6639 2018-12-17 13:07:42 @unicornsistic Hi awak. Saya nak tanya aturan pakai skincare boleh tak? Ni untuk waktu malam.

6642 2018-12-17 13:07:19 Remove the scab once it's super dried out. Then moisturise the under skin. I used my normal face moisturiser mixed with tea tree oil for my chin after my nephew scratched me. I mean it's still there but only visible when focus on my chin.

Sorry to hear that 
6643 2018-12-17 13:07:05 As a cancer survivor, message boards & articles helped prepare me 4 the side effects of chemo. Long before the internet, some folks searched 4 snake oil potions.

6648 2018-12-17 13:06:11 How much of that US oil originated in western Canada? Asking for a friend.
6649 2018-12-17 13:05:57 Best way, you need a big metal container, a coat hanger, pan-lid, & a lot of veg oil - which can be recycled!
6650 2018-12-17 13:05:50 Georgia, Estonia ect ect.  sorry, Russia needs to be walled off and separated from the west until this latest paranoia gets better. Don’t think it will tho.... oil is going away as electric cars take off. What will Russia do with no economy???
6651 2018-12-17 13:05:48 I wish my car magically got oil changes by itself.

6655 2018-12-17 13:04:54 And again, at no point did I say people can't get excited by #Oilers winning games but when that next poor stretch comes & the initial instinct is to jump on the players' for their apparent "lack of effort" perhaps the masses may want to take a more levelheaded view toward things

6680 2018-12-17 13:01:22 Earth is a good planet. It makes people like Zinke and poachers and palm oil farmers seem illogical.

6697 2018-12-17 13:00:27 Buy more oil from Canada, we don't murder journalists. Actually we haven't murdered anyone since the '60s (I think) we did away with the death penalty decades ago. (Explains our violent crime rate doesn't it!)
6698 2018-12-17 13:00:21 Their pissed and saying we shouldn't interfere with their country...they are right, lets stop interfering by cutting off any aid, ending all our arms deals with them and stop buying their oil.

6701 2018-12-17 13:00:05 @BurgerKing just ate one of your sausage biscuits. It’s been a while since I had one. Why did the biscuit taste like rancid oil? Do they not know oil isn’t the same as butter? Feeling ill in the morning before work isn’t a good way to start the day.

6707 2018-12-17 12:59:00 If we ruin earth, we would probably ruin mars too. Then where do we go? Europa? Cold. Not much sun. Titan? Really cold. Oil spills for lakes. Methane rain. Hard to import oxygen and water.
6708 2018-12-17 12:58:55 @Morning_Joe The largest sources of U.S. imported oil: Canada (40%), Saudi Arabia (11%), Venezuela (9%), Mexico (8%), and Colombia (4%). And they treat Canada like some unimportant country?? They should look again!

Do you max out the heat for a flash cook?

Olive oil or vegetable oil?

What about steak sauce or ketchup?

Did you get this in @SteveDoocy’s cookbook?

6723 2018-12-17 12:57:00 Said the President whose faith in scarcity was his mantra. His Russian buddies neglected to tell him that the Earth makes oil. Or, he knew it and withheld it from us because scarcity gives the government control.

6742 2018-12-17 12:54:48 When people eats psychadelic mushrooms, they begin to talk accidentally and unconciousely until they are given red oil to drink. We will wait for 2019 to charge it with the verdict.
6743 2018-12-17 12:54:18 I'm same as you. Average a little over 190 so no disaster but I'm torn.

Even now, as a frustrated holder, when I put pen to paper there is no case for selling.

What is the exact nature and source of the oil you are trying to refine? How light is it to begin with? I presume you are aware of the best way to

6872 2018-12-17 12:38:37 Not remotely a reply you should apologise for. Idea that a winter coat (for adults at least)  is an annual purchase is obscene, enabled by cheap oil & very often exploitative labour practices.  Children do grow & IME parents are snobbish about 2nd hand clothing even for siblings

6874 2018-12-17 12:38:29 Do we have a gang problem? I think we have an employment problem for oil workers, i think we have a tax problem. Both of which don’t justify wasting on gangs?
6875 2018-12-17 12:38:27 Spectacular how Arab oil money got Shalke for Man Shitty
Spectacular how Spanish farmers got Ajax and Lyon!
Spectacular indeed.

6877 2018-12-17 12:38:13 They did this in 2008 too.  Waived 50k loan for farmers and won 2009..2014 they couldn't due to bad finances & high oil prices

6884 2018-12-17 12:37:41 Psalm: 23
“Even though I walk
    through the darkest valley of death,
I will fear no evil,
    for you are with me;
your rod and your staff,
    they comfort me.
You prepare a table before me
    in the presence of my enemies.
You anoint my head with oil;
    my cup overflows.
6885 2018-12-17 12:37:34 So people can’t get too excited about the teams play today, but it’s appropriate for people to still be excited about bad moves in the past?    IMO we’re  not quite good enough yet, but you can’t change history. We can only look ahead. But that’s just my opinion, yours is yours
6886 2018-12-17 12:37:27 Is it a oil painting of her??..... whoever takes that pic should be fired

6892 2018-12-17 12:37:04 I just have to laugh at ppl like you who think "individual" donations, are 10.00 donations from janitor types at Exxon Mobil. Do you even know that corporations are recognized as individuals at fed/state levels?
Beto vowed not to accept BUT HAS KEPT GAS AND OIL $. He is owned.
6893 2018-12-17 12:37:01 I don’t wanna get my oil changed by myself, I wonder if my dad will come lol

6902 2018-12-17 12:36:02 We need a reverse separatist party -- a party in ROC dedicated to expelling Quebec from Confederation because it refuses to accept oil from Alberta.  Hypocrite Trudeau supports Quebec boycotting Canada East pipeline project, but defies BC government by sponsoring BC pipeline.

6907 2018-12-17 12:35:08 I'm really curious what makes you say he's one of the best. He lost to Ted Cruz and broke the No Fossil Fuel pledge by taking large donations from around 25 oil executives. He avoids taking policy stands, and his voting record in the House is abysmal. Where does this come from?
6908 2018-12-17 12:35:02 Aku jadinya risih dan ga pernah pake lagi tiap malem. Padahal mantul sih... Cuma bikin berbulu/? wajah itu yg aku sayangkan.

Grapeseed oilnya mantul buat komedo. Jadi aku pake buat cleansing oil gitu, komedonya kayak langsung lunak dan gampang dibersihkan.
6909 2018-12-17 12:34:56 I think you will find Westminster/England has always been the scrounger as they have raped many countries around the world to keep the south of England propped up. Oh and where do you think the money came from for the C tunnel & M25? Scottish oil!  #indyref2

And assess the environmental amd socio-ec impacts of oil coming INTO Canada.

6914 2018-12-17 12:34:23 But Diamond Bank's loan issues weren't all Oil & Gas problems. They exceeded the Single Obligor Limit for several non Oil& Gas customers and this isn't even recent. I went for a meeting years back when they were hoping to 'sell' some of these loans to other Banks...

6920 2018-12-17 12:34:08 There is 44 trillion barrels of oil in the Arctic at 50 dollars a barrel. And for sure his commission was 19 % . And his wonderful supporters have been saying he loves America and isn’t taking a salary. They are truly dumber than dirt or at least have shit for brains.

6935 2018-12-17 12:31:47 That's arguable. Russia's main exports (oil & gas) depend on West-set prices and as soon as those plummet they're done.

6939 2018-12-17 12:31:16 Ok an Oreo contains palm oil and is industrial therefore exploitating workers. Not exactly vegan in my book. Please don’t propose junk food recipes.

6953 2018-12-17 12:29:07 Fair proposal I guess. But then it has to apply to everyone, including solar manufacturers to deal with all their e-waste and the toxic lead and cadmium that comes out of the PV cells when they get disposed of. What will those do to the planet? But hey, it’s “cleaner” than oil...

6962 2018-12-17 12:26:58 I spoke with Bush who bought oil forbSPR and the Epstein Fund was taking counter-party risk for a NYMEX listing. Then he got in trouble. No one in NY wanted to deal.

That's not American First!
That's Trump & Russia First!
6983 2018-12-17 12:25:08 You just go from one bit of slander and divisiveness to another. Will you do anything to protect your oil investments?

7003 2018-12-17 12:23:00 Caused by your governments direct attack on our resources.  You have anti oil lobbyists as staff.  Support the pipelines!  It's the over taxed under supported people who are hurting.
7004 2018-12-17 12:22:57 Get me some buyers who are willing to sign an off take contract of adequate size.

7022 2018-12-17 12:20:14 Seems to me HH can produce around 1000 bopd just from a Verticle well which is massive.

Big Al like to say HH is not designed to produce from the Kimmeridge.

Well you could have fooled me!

 Nuclear is the only way they can keep the lights on to 39million in the Tokyo region.

7099 2018-12-17 12:10:44 It’s a lot of lost revenue - oil that’s moving anyway but slower and less efficiently and to a market that has us over a barrel. All it takes to solve it is for port communities to be ports for all of Canada. Freely and fairly. 
And for the feds to treat pipelines fairly.

7162 2018-12-17 12:04:14 Most of the time the answer is oil
7163 2018-12-17 12:04:01 You are a MAGA Con-man. Blinded by racism /Russians propaganda with lies and deceit. There bout 30,000,000 real suckers,  USA citizens that support Trump Antics.  Don’t read my writing if worry about grammar.  This is like oil fields short hand.  Trump will resign
7164 2018-12-17 12:03:55 Unfortunately the harvesting of palm oil is destroying their natural habitat and killing them rapidly!

7166 2018-12-17 12:03:39 You are probably right. We are part of a confederation. I doubt our founding fathers were thinking about oil when they decided upon the rules, but they had enough trouble getting a railroad as I recall. You should probably declare independence,
7167 2018-12-17 12:03:36 ... There is oil and diamonds in the arctic actually.
7168 2018-12-17 12:03:32 Not gonna lie I wish RnB was still what it was.. call me what you will but I got that BABY OIL MUSIC on deck..
7169 2018-12-17 12:03:23 This ole henriksen glow cycle is doing WORK on my skin, I think I like it better than the Luna sleeping oil!
7170 2018-12-17 12:03:11 Could I be pinching wrong? It's just sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn't. Indeed I have a rag to clean the screen every so often to prevent the oil from my skin mudding up the screen.

7190 2018-12-17 12:00:29 Even more reason to reject the reckless snake oil salesmen who brought us to this level of internal division and massive inequality. If your analysis of the situation in the UK, France and US ignores inequality as a causal variable, I suggest your narrative is propaganda.

7204 2018-12-17 11:57:28 Then why r ppl. still working for $7.50/hr. and holding down 2 or 3 jobs? Snake oil salesmen.
7205 2018-12-17 11:57:24 If you zoom in on the smaller one it looks a little like an oil exploration vessel.

7210 2018-12-17 11:56:55 And if they were supplied with oil from Energy East they would process it rather than american oil. Why is that so difficult for you and the province of quebec to understand? Having a single highly maintained and safe pipeline cross Quebec is NOT the devil incarnate.

7212 2018-12-17 11:56:52 No worries. I agree. From 1943, the Med wound down in terms of direct military signif post-Alamein and German reversal on the Eastern Front. On the other hand, it's economic signif. continued long after (eg. Iranian oil was the sole source of oil for Pacific theatre post Mar '42)

7216 2018-12-17 11:55:03 Great comment. The graph was specific to QC.  How much oil we have available and in reserve in N.A. is one issue.  How willing we are to extract and use it is another.  And who we choose to buy oil from yet another.  This is an economic issue affected by societal values.
7217 2018-12-17 11:54:55 Oh that'll be the same HSBC that influenced the banning of the orangutan and palm tree Iceland advert because it was too political. Or or just maybe because HSBC has around 8 billion invested in the extraction of palm oil ?
7218 2018-12-17 11:54:49 WTI crude oil (NYMEX) = 51.55 USD/bbl (1 year change: -10.13%)

7303 2018-12-17 11:43:44 The article is total nonsense. All they can find is 'tax breaks for oil and gas exploration in the North Sea and the decommissioning of oil'

7306 2018-12-17 11:43:25 Why don't we start buying more of our oil from North and South American sources, increase our own production (environmentally responsible as possible), while fast tracking electric cars. Saudi Arabia shouldn't be as prominent on the world stage as they are. Evil despotic regime
7307 2018-12-17 11:43:21 Is it really the Dozie family? Diamond has a large NPL exposure to the oil sector, this has been since Alex Otti.

The current WTI rebound is vigorous but unsustainable in the end.
7314 2018-12-17 11:42:07 Palm oil is a very complex issue and a lot of consumers are unclear as to what is best to protect our environment. It's important to differentiate the crop from how it is produced - palm oil can be produced sustainably and consumers can encourage brands to do more.

7351 2018-12-17 11:38:22 She won’t buy bottles. They buy the oil with the bottles at 150. When they buy the bottles, they pay less. That is when they buy the 25 Litre kegs.

Two business models
7352 2018-12-17 11:38:12 Also aware of the governance stigma PSUs face despite some being dominant/leading players. Focus on allocation with that risk in mind and limited downside (unless oil & nat gas prices fluctuate wildly).

7440 2018-12-17 11:23:25 Yes it’s a big issue on many farms. Traditionally milk fat depression was associated with high cereal grain intakes and low dietary fibre. Now it’s thought feeds high in PUFA (eg lush pasture high in oil content) can have altered rumen fermentation.

These are the obvious ones. Your other claims are exaggerated as well

They'll say they can do no wrong and all they do is justified because they found oil in 1947 and think fossil fuel based economies will survive the future so they force pollution on planet.

7479 2018-12-17 11:16:39 Yes. Do you have a link? Because the reality is that we will see fossil fuels used to provide energy and liquefied CO2 for enhanced oil recovery for the foreseeable future. Just ask Thelma Krug, Christiana Figueres, or James Hansen. Continued fossil fuel use means more mining.

7513 2018-12-17 11:11:15 The oil money is a bit of a curse tbh. Because of inflation, it's a trillion dollars we can only use and invest outside of the country. But politically, it has great potential to sway opinion even though we use a maximum of 3% of the returns locally

7599 2018-12-17 10:55:58 What we do know is we were sold indy on a false prospectus-Ludicrous oil rev projections that were indeed 'baked into the numbers'.Instead of milk & honey we'd have had eye watering austerity on an unprecedented scale.Would Sturgeon have backed a 2nd peoples vote for duped Scots?

7640 2018-12-17 10:47:34 How do we achieve that with the drastic drop in oil revenue. Borrowing. U can also research the American recession of 2007 and see how they had to borrow trillions of dollars to pull out of it. It took them over 4quarters to pull out with the negative impact still subsisting.

7726 2018-12-17 10:33:24 I had a katsudon for dinner but the resturant had filled the soy sauce bottle on the table with chilli oil and I didn't realise this until I'd sprinkled it liberally all over my food. 
7727 2018-12-17 10:33:21 This does not work if it was a different policy for oil and gas yes but the rest its all the same,

7761 2018-12-17 10:27:32 Ehhh, Greek is pretty good but it’d be better with spices. Putting lemon, oregano and olive oil on everything isn’t all that interesting.
7762 2018-12-17 10:26:33 Pretty sure we already know how to make plastic that dissolves when it touches salt water and out of help not oil. So the problem is not as big as you say. It is a simple passing of a regulation on industry. Will we do it? Nah,.
7763 2018-12-17 10:26:30 Lol what kind of engineering
7764 2018-12-17 10:26:24 I have seen reports, somewhere here in Germany, about the 'old' paper industry being a positive giver, so to say. They replant more than they use. Most of the tree clearing in the tropics is to make way for Palm - for Palm oil. And for beef/meat production
7765 2018-12-17 10:26:13 Thank you! Great stuff. And important to establish the links. I will write something on 'men and oil' in the spring to try to highlight the gender dimensions of climate (in)action
7766 2018-12-17 10:26:00 I am glad my grandfather, who worked in oil fields for 50 years, is not here to see this. He was angered when they were contracted to test geological stability of places that had plates near them yet companies put natural gas wells nearby anyways. And explosions happened.

7774 2018-12-17 10:24:42 The United Kingdom is not remotely comparable to Venezuela and has not existed under US sanctions and CIA interference for decades. The UK is not a strategic oil rich nation, nor does it have modern-day poverty in the same way as Venezuela.

7784 2018-12-17 10:23:23 Fingers,toes,legs and paws crossed today (and this week) that my sister and sister in laws oil boiler will be installed with no fuss. Their house is like Siberia and the greatest present for them right now would be some heating!
7785 2018-12-17 10:22:48 The economy actually quite strong but auto payments, credit card payments, housing, and rising oil could dampen growth.

7799 2018-12-17 10:20:18 Yes in the US in some states it's legal but here it's not & there's empirical evidence to suggest it helps. I would ask canavape for some full spectrum oil or eliquid as that is the closest to what you'll get in the US.

7867 2018-12-17 10:08:49 Why leave used oil in the garage
7868 2018-12-17 10:08:47 It's simple , we have huge trade deficit. It means currency is going to be depreciated, there is no other way. Market has more money and power then any govt in the world, let it free flow, it will find it right price based on import/export data. We can't live with 83% oil import.

7873 2018-12-17 10:08:07 Oil for Quebec is shipped from Alberta on Enbridge line 9. Alberta is the biggest supplier of oil to PQ, who buy almost 90% of their oil in Canada and the USA

7875 2018-12-17 10:07:56 My experience of the outdoor chicken so far is the flavour is second to none.

7885 2018-12-17 10:06:11 No heat, vitamin e supplements or oil!
7886 2018-12-17 10:06:01 It has changed. It is now just a party of anti progress on anything. They want coal, oil, women to shut up and cook while making babies, and white men in power. Democrats want diversity, equality, eco friendly technology, and don't care who you love so long as it's s/s/c!

7890 2018-12-17 10:04:30 You know the phrase literally translates to "Garlic and oil". You can make a basic aioli easy with just garlic, salt and olive oil.
7891 2018-12-17 10:04:25 Oh Quentin. Is an oil company paying you? Copenhagen shows that a city can be a success with the majority cycling. And London shows that with properly invested public transport,  you can be the richest city in the world and only 25% require cars.

7928 2018-12-17 09:58:20 When I studied to become a massage therapist we learned about the nerve receptors around each hair follicle, so I integrated a hair/scalp massage into the very beginning of my routine (before I put oil on my hands) - It included stroking, tugging, etc. It went over REALLY well

7938 2018-12-17 09:57:01 Hmm. If you grind up whole green cannabis and add a MCT oil to thicken it you can add it into capsules. That wouldn't be illegal would it? No active THC would be in it.

7940 2018-12-17 09:56:31 Imports are what we *need*.

People every day go to the supermarket and buy French wine and cheese, Spanish sausage or Italian olive oil. We buy German cars... 

I'm sorry but you can't just ignore imports. That's economic madness given the data I've shown you.

You sheikh ass gangsters who used to eat each other when you were mere tribes barely a hundred years ago. We'd do shit bout Assad if not for Trump.
7953 2018-12-17 09:55:15 This might be a bill of 10 billion dollars in one order. After this there will be annual costs. How is Erdogan going to fund this? By his grip on the Syrian and Iraqi oil (Kurd territory)? Troubles might escalate in the Mediterranean.

7956 2018-12-17 09:54:23 This is the only time they avoid talking about the Agikuyu. Our African history is distorted. The Agikuyu suffered immensely from the British atrocities. That is indelible fact!
7957 2018-12-17 09:53:56 2- Iran what we call is "wolf in sheep's skin", when we as Muslims see them as our brothers, while they sent terrorists multiple times to attack our soldiers, and they also make oil and trade agreements with India. Terrorist living in Iran should be destroyed.#ISPR #attackonketch

7959 2018-12-17 09:53:22 Did he spout tosh like Indy Scotland could be set up for £200m and be done in 18 months?

Did he suggest we gamble our public services on oil revenue forecasts that turned out to be £8b wrong in Year 1?

Or was that, eh, someone else?

Nationalism always messes up your mind...

My ex boyfriend has shop in Amsterdamn which just sells the oil so I could get it I suppose but on so many meds got go through them all to make sure oil wouldn’t have adverse effects wen used with them
7961 2018-12-17 09:52:35 I do occasionally, but don't make a habit out of it due to skin oil causing plasticizer loss. I usually sleep with a blanket between myself and the toy. Snuggling up to a properly sized and shaped toy, like the new Jet Creations German shepherd, is an amazing feeling

8019 2018-12-17 09:40:32 The worst seems to be over for the Indian rupee. Data on Friday showed the trade gap narrowed to $16.7 billion in November from October's $17.1 billion as a drop in oil prices helped. With oil prices subdued for now, chances are the rupee might inch higher.
8020 2018-12-17 09:40:30 There’s enough hyberbole in this industry. From logo’d vulns hyped to hell by marketing to snake oil “which threat actors are coming for you today?” pitches. It’s counterproductive.

8053 2018-12-17 09:35:31 The blankets are quite pricey but I've heard some great things about em.  Also got my dad a CBD ointment for pain that works well so I think it's definitely worth giving the oil a go
8054 2018-12-17 09:35:28 Peel your potatoes and put in a large pot with cold water. Add a bit of salt and bring to the boil until potatoes are extremely soft.

Chop your onion and in another pot bring some oil to high heat and fry your onions till soft, add your stewing lamb and brown the meat
8055 2018-12-17 09:35:22 so it turns out that cars need oil to run well, who knew?

8066 2018-12-17 09:32:56 The Saudi's couldn't give a toss as we are infidels to them. Unfortunately they have the oil and buy a lot of stuff from the west.
Until our dependence on oil ends we are unlikely to see any change.
8067 2018-12-17 09:32:39 Better to be known as a laughing stock than a murderous warmonger that kills & starves millions for oil. Arms the most violent racist regimes on the planet, threatens pre-emptive nuclear strikes & has killed 120,000 of it's own ppl with austerity.
8068 2018-12-17 09:32:30 酸性かアルカリ性に傾きすぎるとしみるんだよ。薬の性質上、酸性かアルカリ性じゃないと崩壊してしまうやつもあるから、仕方ないんだなぁ
8069 2018-12-17 09:32:21 At they know that a car needs oil, educate them on where it should be applied.
8070 2018-12-17 09:32:15 I've not use CBD oil but if you do decide to go for it make sure you look online for some decent stuff and don't get it from Holland and Barrett or something. Also take a look at a weighted blanket for sleep issues

8075 2018-12-17 09:31:41 Must be too busy making the big bucks... what they do is swoop in project phase and bid up the value of top graduates, rather than invest in creating their own. In mega O&G projects, for example, Big Oil consistently fails to live up to training KPIs - as well as tax rorting.

8084 2018-12-17 09:30:35 The problem is the international community together with our bad leaders benefit from the oil refined outside. So a leader who will want to make our refineries work must be ready to fight internal and international forces.

8145 2018-12-17 09:18:31 What we are saying is PMB is a failure and bad luck follows him about. I'd not, we would one man rule 2ce & both time, Nigeria is faced with revenue problems, hunger & problems. He is not meant to rule that's why all the ill luck. Oil revenue fell cos of his luck. #2019debates
8146 2018-12-17 09:18:25 Do you harvest your oil from the grease between her rolls? You would have enough oil to sell until you die if you did

8148 2018-12-17 09:18:14 Have you not been keeping up Natasha? Alberta's production of Light conventional crude oil has been making a comeback. And we haven't even started the CO2 based EOR. Up to a third of the oil in EE could be light to feed the refineries.

1.1 year of living in Lake Victoria and only drinking the water for sustenance
2.6 months of having fish thrown at you
3.4 weeks of eating only fish products particularly fish oil.

8158 2018-12-17 09:15:49 Angry for what, a car?. They could've possibly drunk that oil and something terrible happened to them, you should be grateful they didn't. It's should be lesson to you and us here to keep oil and other stuff out of children's reach. On a lighter note, they thought it was a polish
8159 2018-12-17 09:15:37 Oil Prices edged up amid a fall in drilling activity in the United States, but lingering concerns about weaker economic growth in major economies kept a lid on gains.
8160 2018-12-17 09:15:30 Great start to the week, spilled my beard oil and when I got in the car the engine light came on and power steering failed. This week can fuck off already
8161 2018-12-17 09:15:19 Shame on UN, OIC, US and Human Rights organization for not raising their voice against Indian Brutality.

8170 2018-12-17 09:13:27 Hi Bill, generalisations r generally a good way of making a general point. The facts are many mining and oil companies explore & produce in countries considered 3rd World that remain so because most of the wealth leaves via wages and profits. Not much is left for nation building.

8176 2018-12-17 09:12:49 Oil's gone up, and the Star Wars license has too. But Lego's gone plant-based so that should help reduce costs in the coming years. Besides the positive environmental impact.

8189 2018-12-17 09:10:55 Lack of economic diversity and over reliance on oil a really bad idea. Cancel Trans Mountain and invest the $14 billion in the clean equitable economy of the future. Would probably create more jobs too.

8192 2018-12-17 09:10:34 One of the reasons why govt's in S.E  Asia are at the front line of 'Environment' campaigns is bse they realise it was a mistake to cut natural forests and replace them with Oil palm trees. Indeed, Brazil stopped 'Oil palm' projects in the Amazon. Y then should we replicate?

Post-GST, you save Rs 320 on monthly spend of Rs 8,400

8274 2018-12-17 08:56:33 That's how corrupt and tainted the US political system has become with monied influence and politicians owned by big oil, big pharma and now Russia. The GOP didn't background or even care what they found if they did. Co-conspirators.

8283 2018-12-17 08:53:29 Lol this is such a weak argument. The Oil took sloppy penalties, the Canucks did NOT. You would not be saying  refereeing is broken had Oilers won. You can hang on to your cup win from like 30 years ago but dont be so INSECURE and fail to realize the Oilers simply got outplayed.

8286 2018-12-17 08:53:03 .....CBN prudential guidelines & the guiding ratios like NPLs, CAR & liquidity, which had been negatively affected by its recent poor showing in the last few years

Its deep exposure to the oil & gas & power sector and the nonperformance of these 2 played a significant role here

8310 2018-12-17 08:49:07 If I were UK chancellor or Defence Sec I'd refuse to allow a no-deal.

why?

1. N Sea Oil and gas revenues
2. energy provision in E&W relies on UK-wide market
3. future of Trident
4. strategic air bases for defence of "Greenland gap"

don't forget pensions industry based in Sco
8311 2018-12-17 08:48:47 Mmm...
50% of ROI exports go to UK. 
90%+ OF ROI oil & gas comes from UK. 
Most of ROI exports to EU go by road through UK. 
ROI dependent on RAF for air defence. 
With Leo's country so reliant on the UK, it's remarkable how free he is with the threats and negative vibes

8317 2018-12-17 08:47:51 With that attitude it’s no wonder you’ve gathered so many followers in such a short time.For some reason pollution is forgotten, then the fact it takes oil to run a Navy, Air Force and Army, and a lot of it, so unless you protest it, renewables will not ever replace oil.
8318 2018-12-17 08:47:30 During winters, the scalp becomes drier than usual and can cause dandruff and scalp irritation. No matter how busy you are, don’t forget to oil your hair twice a week to keep it moisturised and dandruff-free. #Winter #Skincare #Tip

8321 2018-12-17 08:46:44 Hi Richard. Ha, yes maybe, that puts a picture in my head I'd rather not see though...Or has he found out about my passion for olive oil, perhaps? He says this to a lady who often says "I'd rather sit in the dark/use candles than go to war over oil".
8322 2018-12-17 08:46:39 Norway also labels products (e.g. biscuits) to tell you if they don’t contain palm oil. And there are products that don’t contain palm oil...

8328 2018-12-17 08:45:36 The ability to speak is a shortcut to distinction. It puts a person in the limelight, raises one head and shoulders above the crowd.
8329 2018-12-17 08:45:21 Cibc didn’t cancel the conference. Only the oil and gas portion of it. Oil and gas people are no longer invited. Cibc is still supporting Whistler.

8332 2018-12-17 08:44:43 Well then you best hope Brexit happens. Then Scotland leaves the UK because Sturgeon will argue things have change since the Scottish referendum and boom- Scotland gets to join the EU. And- just think, Scotland gets its oil back . Oh- it’s trading at$50 a barrel though....

8346 2018-12-17 08:43:03 Oil licences are often the biggest reward for political patronage in Nigeria, with many oil blocks now owned or partly owned by politicians and govt cronies.

8376 2018-12-17 08:39:42 Let’s judge PDP on its record. At the time PDP was in power especially from 2010 - 2014, oil sold for over $100 per bbl. When APC took power in 2015, the price was about $30. Today it’s about $60. With far less FX, @MBuhari is fixing infrastructure. Doing a lot more with less.
8377 2018-12-17 08:39:35 The Zoo called Nigeria was not meant to Exist in the first place if not the love of Oil& Gas from Biafra Land, is the reason British joined Oil & water to live together by

8425 2018-12-17 08:33:25 Another fun fact. The billions of $$$ we spend on Saudi oil is gone, poof, never to come back.
Wouldn't it be more fiscally responsible for eastern Canada to buy Canadian oil and have all those billions circulate within our country?

8427 2018-12-17 08:33:12 Again, if we stopped subsidizing oil, coal , pharma, and big agri businesses we could invest in establishing manufacturing and invest in training here

8441 2018-12-17 08:31:47 The Bloomberg news service reported over the weekend that even in the oil heartlands in the US oil exploration is being quietly put off; seems it’s no longer a paying proposition. The @NZNationalParty position is wildly impractical, and the oil industry knows it.

8457 2018-12-17 08:28:48 We should not keep expanding oil production just because there is a demand for it.   It’s like feeding crack to an addict just because he keeps asking for it.

8467 2018-12-17 08:27:10 #AAOG great news this morning with oil shows on R1/R2/R3. Derisks the lower zones and hopefully the end of the bad news period. Taking the opportunity to add on dips as this should start it's journey to double figures and beyond as drill progresses to Mengo next.
8468 2018-12-17 08:26:45 Then there was CBD oil and an Alzheimer’s med and ganglion blocks and Botox and cyberknife and RFA and   Amitriptyline and memantine and tamadol and tegretol and shit the list goes on.

8504 2018-12-17 08:21:19 Now apply that logic to Scotland's position.

8562 2018-12-17 08:12:40 The boom and bust of the oil sands  is never going  to work for  job stability, you need a more diversified economy.
8563 2018-12-17 08:11:37 Dr Roberts,
with this well thought thesis, you may have inadvertently become the first to be awarded credits for this BA 
I wonder if topics such as Howard's decision process for the invasion of Iraq, or the ethics of 'wheat for oil' will be covered. 
Probably not.
8564 2018-12-17 08:11:26  - this is worse than mine. That's 710 (oil)!!! 
8565 2018-12-17 08:11:24 えへへ 恥ずかしい( )
8566 2018-12-17 08:11:09 I, er, dunno. I imagine it as some viscous black fluid, like oil or ichor. 

Science will likely disagree with me.

8574 2018-12-17 08:09:54 Yes because of course there is no cost to refine the oil or to transport the oil or to pay any overheads is there? And today's cost of oil is irrelevant to today's retail cost as utd bought as a future.. Sourced and paid for months ago...
8575 2018-12-17 08:09:51 So what were all these GOP,and Trump,promised to be complicit? Get rid of sanctions,and the oil money flows! It was for Wilbur Ross,sanctions be damned! Hey Mitch!Whats in YOUR WALLET?

8580 2018-12-17 08:08:40 Such a lovely place. Indeed, the olive oil and red wine in moderate amounts are quite healthy which can explain the longevity in that region. Take care, ladies, and I hope you both have a great day.
8581 2018-12-17 08:08:39 Can America calculate how much they need  in term of Oil in oder to remove for us Dictator and number one corrupt president and gets backs to Ugandan?? I think we are ready for that business,thanks
8582 2018-12-17 08:08:26 He does not. Beto has refused PAC donations. He has received individual donations from employees of oil companies like my husband. There are over 300,000 Texans employed in this field and many are Democrats.

8585 2018-12-17 08:08:13 Took Guardiola a couple seasons to oil his Manc  machines, Klopp too.. And Klopp hasn't won shit.. I do hope he wins the league.. Regardless
8586 2018-12-17 08:08:10 I'm rooting for it. The earth's been much warmer and plants thrived so much, they produced all this oil.

8597 2018-12-17 08:07:11 What? No tanker ban on the East coast? No tanker ban on the St. Lawrence Seaway? How can that be!?

And whether or not it is Saudi oil, virtually NONE of it is Canadian oil. It could ALL be Cdn oil if not for obstructionist fools like @francoislegault and @JustinTrudeau.
8598 2018-12-17 08:07:10 Lemme tell you something 
Everything you seeing or heard bout Nigerians is all what makes us who we're. Nigerian is so big yes we might beg on this app or fetch spilled groundnut oil in the gutter but the fact still remains that Nigeria is great unique and special

8608 2018-12-17 08:05:09 Then stop sending it to them.  How stupid are people.  Really, stop using tires, stop using cars (Tesla's have tires too), stop using computers, clothes.  Even when another source of energy is found for cars and homes, will will still use oil.  Is everyone that ignorant?

8613 2018-12-17 08:04:29 Business is not just about running houseful, but also to make people purchase at price that makes it profitable. Besides this international crude oil prices are major factor for profitability. But @jetairways has got the art of running a loss making business by hook or crook.

8618 2018-12-17 08:04:04 No.

The sun and wind companies are huge.

And are favored by the big oil companies.

Because the backup to wind and solar, is Oil or Gas.

eg: Solar 20% Capacity Factor means Gas 80% of the time.

You are defeating yourself friend.

8629 2018-12-17 08:01:50 I think it gets some people’s backs up for class reasons: lonely little princess among the oil paintings. However, I think we should acknowledge mh issues of the ruling class, from shitty parenting, boarding school, etc, not least because of impact lower down the food chain

8631 2018-12-17 08:01:06 The oil issue in AB isn’t about pipelines.  It’s about supply mismanagement of a filthy commodity without a transition strategy to spare any more hardship to those whose lives currently depend upon it.

8677 2018-12-17 07:51:34 The only real scarcity is knowledge. Before we knew how to use fossil fuels, there was a scarcity of whale oil. The stone age did not end because we ran out of stones.

Really appreciated.
8702 2018-12-17 07:45:45 Ji apply heat on that area. Then rest your neck ji. Next put any traditional oil and massage that area ji. 
8703 2018-12-17 07:45:29 Managed to spill almost an entire bottle of cooking oil all over my kitchen floor while I was legging it out the door to work at 5.45am so Monday is going just fabulously so far
8704 2018-12-17 07:45:26 The Black seed oil taste like spicy printing ink, but I do think it’ll be worth it in the end. My asthma feels much better so far

8707 2018-12-17 07:44:42 Strange how people think England has no oil and gas they have plenty and some of the biggest power stations.
8708 2018-12-17 07:44:21 たすけてーー！！
8709 2018-12-17 07:44:17 I use the cheapest containers I could find on Amazon, cook once a week to get it over with, mashed potatoes are easy and healthy and asparagus/broccoli oven roasted on tinder foil with olive oil salt pepper and lemon juice are my two go to greens
8710 2018-12-17 07:44:15 well clove oil is good for numbing tooth pain 
or you could just chew on raw clove 
for the same effect
8711 2018-12-17 07:44:15 Oil prices were largely steady on Monday after falling 2 percent in the previous session, but remained under pressure amid weaker growth in major economies and concerns about oversupply.
8712 2018-12-17 07:44:12 Oil prices were largely steady on Monday after falling 2 percent in the previous session, but remained under pressure amid weaker growth in major economies and concerns about oversupply.
8713 2018-12-17 07:43:50 .... and all the while doubling the nations debt.
Don't get too confident Tim. 
Remember Wayne Swan's famous last words.
It all depends on China/ coal prices/iron ore/oil prices.
Nothing to do with the LNP.
8714 2018-12-17 07:43:47 My problem with Beto is that he is the top House member for receiving money from coal and oil lobbyists. Just say "no," @BetoORourke. Give them their money back and we'll know you are serious about saving the environment and other issues.
8715 2018-12-17 07:43:38 Sadly, not for everyone. Oil of Olay brings my sensitive skin out in an itchy, lumpy rash that lasts for a week! I get on ok with BioDerma products though.
8716 2018-12-17 07:43:28 True true.

It’s not really a classic example of the genre

If you need another proof 
How about people fetching groundnut oil that spilled in a gutter  like WTF
8728 2018-12-17 07:41:48 What’s good to see is the #AAOG geo model is exactly as per results thus far. Oil will be in the Mengo too no doubt, more like appraisal wells. If the Djeno is as per Geo model also this is well above 40p and boom time. FOMO kicking in and shorts closing now

8749 2018-12-17 07:36:51 @jjhorgan i get it now ! If the pipeline goes to the coast people might buy oil instead of your coal. You are a frightened business type afraid of fair competition. So, you break the rules. Interesting ?
8750 2018-12-17 07:36:36 I decree dis week oil of grace upon ur life will never run dry. Many sha find life,peace,joy & fulfillment thru u. U sha be a source of positive influence & channel dat bring testimonies to many. Ur joy sha multiply greatly & u will be celebrated always by d grace of God. Ps 46:1
8751 2018-12-17 07:36:30 The implication is one of the worst jobs to be employed in doesn’t even pay for the bills anymore. Saudis crashed the price of oil and want their competition dead. So, the renewables and EVs make even more sense for domestic growth, but also factor in the cost of wars for oil.
8752 2018-12-17 07:36:28 Olive Oil Nothing beat that! Reading that back sounds filthy!
8753 2018-12-17 07:36:19 Mara why do you leave oil at their level? Yerrr hade
8754 2018-12-17 07:36:03 snake oil salesman to the rescue with a solution that won't make a dent, would wipe out surface dwelling biodiversity, but hey, he'll take you money and offer false hope in a tech solution that will let you continue with the status que, making the problem worse

8759 2018-12-17 07:35:33 Nigeria is owing huge sums of money they collected as loans From China. They might just use the crude oil as a means to pay back some or all of their debt
8760 2018-12-17 07:35:33 Olive oil + chilli + vegeta = experimenting ?
Why don't you show some real conviction and do something brave like salt & pepper!
8761 2018-12-17 07:35:32 4)APPLY MOISTURIZING LIPSTICK OR GLOSS
If you plan to also wear lip gloss or lipstick, look for brands with SPF and moisturizing ingredients like honey, coconut oil, olive oil, jojoba oil shea and coco butter.
8762 2018-12-17 07:35:15 They thought the oil will make the car shine it was meant to be a surprise

8765 2018-12-17 07:35:06 With a recession looming oil has to find a resistance. Sell on rallies.
8766 2018-12-17 07:35:05 I love the oil industry.
8767 2018-12-17 07:34:54 I’m honestly getting tired of putting castor oil on my eyebrows every night. Like pls eyebrow god bless me some more hair! 
8768 2018-12-17 07:34:40 3) APPLY AN OIL OR BUTTER BASED LIP BALM 
After you exfoliate you need to seal your lips with a good lip balm that also has sunscreen.The best ones have natural oils to seal in moisture instead of petroleum jelly. Be sure to read your ingredients labels
8769 2018-12-17 07:34:40 Oh I see @AdriaanBasson has decided to post a pro Israel story. He is highlighting the groundbreaking relationship between Israel and Saudi Arabia & is showing how Israel is the new Saudi Arabia and its technology the new oil. Well done @AdriaanBasson @News24.
8770 2018-12-17 07:34:39 Yeah I dream of it, we keep 100% of our oil, provide no water or electricity south of the border & take zero of the UK's debt! 

Sounds like heaven - there is also zero chance of no deal, WM can't afford it!
8771 2018-12-17 07:34:32 tamanu oil 
8772 2018-12-17 07:34:28 Glad I held tight on #AAOG all R zones have hydrocarbons as per the geo model. Mcap tiny and low free float. Heading into the mengo. It’s always had oil, finally it’s all coming together. 20-40p will be coming.
8773 2018-12-17 07:34:00 1.) I'm 54
2.) I live in Northeastern TN because its alot more affordable than CT 
3.) Depending on the amount: 
1st priority is my soon to be born grandson.
2nd I'd pay some of it forward. 
3rd I'd get my oil changed & go see my granddaughter in Savannah after the baby comes.
8774 2018-12-17 07:33:42 @ImranKhanPTI please encourage Ethanol fuel(petrol) from sugar cane,it will help farmer and save foriegn exchange (FE).encourage canola sowing. It will fulfill need of edible oil & save 2 billion $ in FE. You need no investment for this. Only increase the support price of canola.
8775 2018-12-17 07:33:39 Lol the crude oil part will not happen. Other can happen.

8778 2018-12-17 07:33:19 Don’t think this is right info. @sto_mkt oil margin not big, with stelco rate. 
But I hear some paper companies of MPs, got contract in last 5yrs to deliver fuel to stelco & Fenaka sites atbislands at a very high price
8779 2018-12-17 07:33:17 Middle east loses monopoly over oil markets.
OPEC is trying to stabilize oil markets by cutting down their production
8780 2018-12-17 07:33:14 When I fried up those mozerella sticks, I reignited the hot oil of war.
8781 2018-12-17 07:32:46 2) MAKE YOUR OWN LIP SCRUB
A simple mixture of a teaspoon each of plain sugar, olive oil, and honey (optional) is another great way to exfoliate your lips after wetting them. Like the toothbrush method, scrub in a circular motion being careful not to over-exfoliate.
8782 2018-12-17 07:32:40 In future, we might not be able to pay our LOAN back for these projects. 

And BOOM!!!

China will takeover the Nigeria Railway Cooperation.. 

From there na crude oil, Central Bank etc. 
Say by 2050, Nigeria will now be acquired by China after Africa must have lost Zimbabwe, SA
8783 2018-12-17 07:32:40 odessa at least has friday night lights and weird oil dudes
8784 2018-12-17 07:32:21 nicee!! I’ve never tried using oil. It looks difficult to use 
8785 2018-12-17 07:32:14 Dude you're lucky it's just oil, it could've been so much wors fam, so much worse.

8800 2018-12-17 07:29:35 When the oil and gas lobbyists are your last line of defense..... 
8801 2018-12-17 07:29:25 Couple of factors I can suggest: close ties between geology and climate studies, if you’re looking for active reasons certain govts suck; more passively, the fact that much geology is a curatorial science, so aside from ‘finding more oil’ it’s hard to link it to innovation
8802 2018-12-17 07:29:07 I'm a pro at toothache by this point, and deal with it on a daily basis almost perpetually. 2 paracetamol AND 2 ibuprofen at the same time, even better if you can get them with caffiene. While you wait for it to kick in, get Clove Oil and use a Q-Tip to dab the tooth with the oil

8809 2018-12-17 07:27:56 It, was Kazakhstan, Angola , and Algeria, until recently, now the US is the biggest exporter of oil to Quebec. Where the US gets the oil from , thats another question. Not so straight forward.
8810 2018-12-17 07:27:52 Clearly the oil business just makes for more politically generous gas station attendants in Texas

8812 2018-12-17 07:27:35 We need to drill it. Oil naturally seeps out of the ground and runs in the streams the wildlife drink from. When the wind is right you can smell the oil in the nearby town of Kaktovic.

8815 2018-12-17 07:27:23 Try this thought--"Canola, originally rape-seed oil for machinists and engineers cleaning/ lubricating/cutting ", Moved production to Canada in WW11, sanatised/re-branded via "Canada-oil-A"  to "Canola" to sell as "food". "Consume at own risk" would look good on the label.

Vehicle checks reduce the risk of a break down in a dangerous place.

8835 2018-12-17 07:24:31 Oh, it's a disease. But as spiteful as Trump and his supporters are, I have to think oil and gas lobbyists would pull aside whomever is in power and say "hey, WE WILL PERSONALLY PAY FOR the aerosol program so we don't have to face backlash for what we do."

Big oil impedes. But the irony is the necessity 4 viable forms of alternative energy capable of powering global industry represents 1 of the biggest opportunities in the history of commerce.

So we have a chance 2 do a mitzvah for the world & make big bucks.

Win-win.
8924 2018-12-17 07:07:56 Isn’t that rather obvious? They need to offset a too high oil production somewhere. About 90% of the electricity is generated from oil. And the utility’s purchasing contract is set to 6 USD per barrel. Where is the incentive?

9006 2018-12-17 06:49:02 Hydrogen fuel cell cars are less efficient, more costly, and require more development of infrastructure to keep cars dependent on the oil companies- the ones which produce the natural gas that makes your hydrogen. They’re the dying gasps of oil and aren’t relevant for the future

Actually a flued gas fire is quite a low emissions space heater, as it is very efficient and produces considerably less carbon per unit energy than oil or coal.  May be close to the others in net emissions.   Of course only the pump can cool too.

9122 2018-12-17 06:28:36 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
9123 2018-12-17 06:28:30 Being able to buy a fully electric car of teslas performance is enough compensation. We simply are happy we don’t have to drive laggy legacy gas cars anymore that need regular visits to gas stations, oil change and smog check appointments. The shorter FUD is just ridiculous
9124 2018-12-17 06:28:28 I want more oil
9125 2018-12-17 06:27:58 @fondashondas and Brent drip oil from his asshole
9126 2018-12-17 06:27:45 To think at some point in my life I wanted to be a Nun, I had already chosen a name Sister Maria-Rosa, influenced by going to a Roman Catholic School. I’d probably be that Sister today influencing Father to sell Oil and Holy water
9127 2018-12-17 06:27:33 That's some nice corporate PR you've swallowed. There are better jobs and more revenue from other industries. There's no reason to stick to oil, except this weird fetishization you have. Since you seem intent on shilling for big oil, I'm muting you. Hope you find your conscience.
9128 2018-12-17 06:27:21 My search for the perfect weed oil is over. Airopro’s products are very high in CBD as well as THC, their Buddha strain is 1:1. It’s so calming, as well as GSC hybrid at 83.60% THC, super uplifting. 

I  medicinal marijuana. #legalize

9133 2018-12-17 06:25:43 Realities of English in Scotland.

The ones who are as Scottish in temperament and belief as any of us who strive for Freedom, they are our Brothers and Sisters

The ones who live here and always vote for England’s interests, their families “back home” need our oil money subsidy.

9138 2018-12-17 06:24:43 Querry:
 Why do you keep refering to a black arms merchant that worked to smuggle guns & weapons to middle eastern oil fields & forment violent revolutions a "journalist"?
Are you afraid of the trail back to Brennan? We already know about that so you can stop the lies now.
9139 2018-12-17 06:24:38 #CrudeUpdate: #Oil prices were largely steady on #Monday after falling 2%  in the previous session, but remained under pressure amid weaker #growth in major economies and concerns about oversupply.

9140 2018-12-17 06:24:26 Ovi isnt McDavid, nor did he come into the league in the same situation & it's a different time. If they miss the playoffs in 3 of his first 4 years...that is a major problem.
9141 2018-12-17 06:24:22 It feels so gooood when I grease & oil my hairrrr

9144 2018-12-17 06:23:17 Canucks have been on wrong end of PPs more than a few times this season. Only 2 of the 5 calls are subjective against Oil. Maybe we expected the PP count to even out more in third, but any suggestion McDavid was "mugged" all night is frankly laughable.
9145 2018-12-17 06:23:14 I saw the berries throw their hooks into the soil

9146 2018-12-17 06:22:54 Taking a study break to shower and oil my bawdy lol
9147 2018-12-17 06:22:47 I’ve said it before and now I’ll say it again. The “purchase” of TMX and the blocking of EE pipeline serve one purpose. A: former lib PM Martin owns CSL shipping, one of the largest shipping CO’s in the , headquartered Mtl, is the the largest Saudi Oil importer in NA.. wake up
9148 2018-12-17 06:22:44 that’s why we’re so jobs-heavy in green transition politics! (not gonna get into the “green cars” debate rn) but it’s actually something where as socialists we have to put in effort to win energy workers over. it’s not easy but we’re not going to compromise on ending oil.

9150 2018-12-17 06:22:15 Nigeria is enjoying a generation of intellectuals like the Serbs did in the 1880. 

Sad thing like oil it won't come to much except exported.
9151 2018-12-17 06:21:48 In FB, for every bit of good news about the Philippines (i.e. inflation and oil prices going down, return of Balanggiga bells etc. ), one of the usual top comments is a post saying thanks to Bam and/or Risa.
9152 2018-12-17 06:21:28 You right.... akwaibom did more... but this a oil producing state bro

9155 2018-12-17 06:21:14 Better to support the renewables sector than fossil fuel mining @TKoutsantonisMP. Renewables have a future.  Oil & Gas not so much.
9156 2018-12-17 06:21:08 Guys if you struggle with the morning poohs, try having a cup of coffee (no sugar, milk,creamora, cream. if anything, just coconut oil to reduce the acidity) and about 500ml of water (not sparkling though).

Coffee is a natural mild laxative and water is  a great lubricant.
9157 2018-12-17 06:21:07 Vinegar & Oil Rubber Check
9158 2018-12-17 06:20:23 How about if we lower our oil subsidies and military spending to lower that additional cost?

The deficits generated by not spending on our population goes without question.
9159 2018-12-17 06:19:50 It is very obvious that @JustinTrudeau wants to decimate the oil and gas industry of Alberta. #notmyprimeminister
9160 2018-12-17 06:19:47 i made super good cake mix by using butter instead of cooking oil

9162 2018-12-17 06:19:19 Learnt today the technology exists to create liquid fuel from coal. Coal is plant sourced and is abundant throughout world. Suggested leaving coal in ground would be good as future source of liquid fuel but plenty oil and gas for foreseeable. Our misguided and stupid Govt.
9163 2018-12-17 06:19:08 Red oil swimming in liver pool soup
9164 2018-12-17 06:19:06 Would you go to the bakery to get the oil changed in your car?  Of course you wouldn’t.  You shouldn’t go to a website that sells advertising for banking institutions and expect a correct credit report and score either.  Only the big 3 bureaus or a mortgage partner can help you.
9165 2018-12-17 06:19:05 hard not to think about eating, especially with all that growling. if the wheel squeaks, oil it, right? personally, i recommend bacon, or ice cream, or bacon ice cream, or... deep fried twinkies (with bacon..?)
9166 2018-12-17 06:19:03 お、いる…ッッ(パタリ
9167 2018-12-17 06:18:55 Everybody saw it, but was there a forte? An economy that depended on oil, and nothing else. Abeg, go read basic Economics and come back.
9168 2018-12-17 06:18:47 That looks like the oil slick after Cal-Trans has just filled pot  on the freeway.
9169 2018-12-17 06:18:28 In fact, given the caveats of high quality ingredients, no bun, and cooked without vegetable oil, a cheeseburger with bacon is one of the healthiest meals you can eat. It has a great balance of fat and protein with all of the important macronutrients. (Not joking.)

9177 2018-12-17 06:17:32 They also buy oil at world prices, Brent crude, which today is $9/barrel higher than WTI. That's a 17.5 % premium.

9193 2018-12-17 06:14:23 For me they were a bubble playoff team coming into the season & still are. Which means if they end up on either end of the cutoff line, but are close, it can't really be a shocker.  Certainly a problem when we are 4 yrs into McDavid's career.

9197 2018-12-17 06:13:55 Hey guys the environment provides most of our food supply, has vast economic benefits and is in extreme danger but Rush Limbaugh said climate Change is a myth because oil companies say so. Time to #ownthelibs

9200 2018-12-17 06:13:27 As for the uptick in canadian oil I do believe what you meant was that it started with the Enbridge application to reverse line 9. Started long before junior ever showed up. The approval was made and flow started in fall of 2015 so it “looks” like it’s all under PMJT. far from it
9201 2018-12-17 06:13:22 Doesn’t Alberta have a carbon tax? I don’t support it but there’s definitely some supporters in Alberta which is stupid because oil is Alberta’s one and only base industry and they’re literally voting against their own economic interests

9213 2018-12-17 06:11:00 would be a good 7th on a playoff team that could step in when the inevitable injury happens. Like The Oil King Of Kings did in G6 vs Ana in 2017!!
9214 2018-12-17 06:10:55 The only reason why they laughed cause Nelson Mandela was only released through De Klerk's negotiation exchange for Major Wynard Du Toit captured in Angola for attempting to sabotage oil installation, and upon his release, the Du Toit's family tried to assassinate Mandela.
9215 2018-12-17 06:10:50 Bougieness. Wanting oil and less props.

9225 2018-12-17 06:09:53 Alberta has been slammed with the perfect storm! A NDP goverment who is giving our kids a paltry $96 billion deficit  by 2023! Notelys spending big with borrowed money after losing out on our oil money! & Trudeau well I think we all know of his hate on for Alberta!

9230 2018-12-17 06:09:17 He also takes money from the oil and gas industries and has publicly said he’s not a progressive
9231 2018-12-17 06:09:16 I agree. Someone has to lose. Sometimes the better team doesn’t come out with the W. that’s hockey. But I agree with you on that point
9232 2018-12-17 06:09:03 I swear coconut oil is life changing. You can use it for literally everything!
9233 2018-12-17 06:09:00 Trying to deflect? That's okay it's hard to answer a question that makes you look hypocritical. 
I know O&G wont go tomorrow so I want to improve the world by swapping out unethical oil for ethical oil. If I can improve the life of my fellow Cdn by giving them a job It's win win
9234 2018-12-17 06:09:00 Increase your water intake, eat high caloric meals, and Fennel oil is great for production! Good luck!

9237 2018-12-17 06:08:23 James 13:14 .... Christian  believers in Baruipara (off Kolkata) have so much faith in anointing with blessed oil. While i was there many families brought their bottles to bless to keep at home for prayers and miracles of healings. i also observed in Punjab too.
9238 2018-12-17 06:08:18 I worked in a kitchen as a cadet and this is a home kitchen variation of one of our mainstay dishes. If you wanna add a hot veggie with your meal, drizzle a bit of olive oil on some asparagus, season well with salt, pepper, and parmesan, and throw in the oven for 13ish minutes.
9239 2018-12-17 06:07:53 In my view, it is unfair to reach conclusions on the basis of incomplete information. This is exactly what the politicians want. They want to prejudice us against experts so that they can easily go about peddling their snake oil to us.
9240 2018-12-17 06:06:43 Realistic?  Hockey is unpredictable. A penalty/hit/play can change direction of game in an instant. A wild card can make a playoff run. With that said what’s realistic?

9243 2018-12-17 06:06:08 Best makeup remover is coconut oil; it literally takes EVERYTHING off
9244 2018-12-17 06:06:00 Someone just made +1.33% on WCX: sell Brent Crude Oil 60.242 → 60.202 (20x leverage)  ~ AWWWWW $BCO $USD
9245 2018-12-17 06:05:43 Anything cooked with coconut oil smells like hair to me. Never liked Mallu food for that reason.
9246 2018-12-17 06:05:41 If only there was an easy, inepensive way to get cheap Alberta oil to Vancouver. Maybe a pipeline...quit complaining about gas prices.
9247 2018-12-17 06:05:32 Third.  Got a 2015 Leaf and love it.   The people who claim EVs are “too expensive” haven’t shopped around and done basic math.  Hello 3-cents-per-mile? No oil changes, less repairs/parts? For our car that just stays in town, it was a no-brainer.
9248 2018-12-17 06:05:31 สงสารน้อง..คงเหนื่อยคงเพลียด้วยมั้ง

9255 2018-12-17 06:04:36 公式の展開と自分の解釈が違っていた人が多いのは事実であり、それに関しては仕方が無いことなのでショックを受けて静かに落ち着こうとしている人を「解釈違いとか言ってんじゃね〜よwww」みたいに攻撃するのはやめて欲しいね

9257 2018-12-17 06:03:58 Which is fair to point but for me the biggest issue I have is when they lose a strong of games most scream about a lack of effort and that has rarely if ever been a problem.

9261 2018-12-17 06:03:01 Let it go, it’ll probably run out of oil soon anyway

9263 2018-12-17 06:02:28 They didn't go back because they couldn't find oil lol
9264 2018-12-17 06:02:23 Lol it happens
9265 2018-12-17 06:02:05 Thieves oil is the best cure. The mere mention of it's name can work wonders
9266 2018-12-17 06:01:55 To fix and oil your bat after you score a century?
9267 2018-12-17 06:01:31 I actually thought you were responding to a different tweet, my bad. With that said, I'm all for hope but just want the ask for this group  to be kept realistic.
9268 2018-12-17 06:01:24 Hitch is such a crafty old fucker. He could have killed the PK unit or said the goalie had an off-night but bcos the Oil finish with a wide disparity in PPs, he plays the "97 gets mobbed card." 100 bucks says he had this ready to go five games ago:)
9269 2018-12-17 06:01:08 There’s Sun Breeze “Essential Oil” on my desk. The vial says: 
 “Caution: Avoid eye contact”.
 I stopped looking at it, but am not sure what will happen if I sneak another peek. Any ideas?

Even if the oil/coal barons and their puppet politicians and leaders wont move an inch

If the 99% make a move for the green and just future ,the 1% wont matter.

9289 2018-12-17 05:59:30 So sad
9290 2018-12-17 05:58:52 I’m not trying to be rude it just seems as soon as we string together a couple wins people dig up stats to shit on them instead of enjoying the wins for what they are
9291 2018-12-17 05:58:42 Alla kulli hal
9292 2018-12-17 05:58:38 lmaooo. just go and get your oil money, I'm readyyyyy
9293 2018-12-17 05:58:38 #BrainHealth : #Veggies are especially beneficial for our brains. If you aren't a #vegetable lover, try roasting them with olive oil. I often use brain-friendly spices like rosemary, and turmeric.
9294 2018-12-17 05:58:28 They are great for a little protein/good carb add-in. Use the canned ones. Rinse/dry them,  then roast in the oven on 350 degrees- after you’ve seasoned them w/whatever you like (salt and pepper, garlic, turmeric, parsley) and a olive oil. Then you can add them to any veg/salad.
9295 2018-12-17 05:58:15 Your people hate my people.
My people hate your people.
It's got nothing to do with any kind of God or higher power.
We'll talk about it like it's about religion but the truth is it never was.

It was about oil pipelines.
It was about a destroyed economy that America didn't fix.
9296 2018-12-17 05:58:01 I'm low on oil and gold.... now I'll only be low on one!
9297 2018-12-17 05:57:57 "...warning that the move could have repercussions on its strategic ties with Washington".
What garbage! Without US equipment and training these obscenely rich Bedouin would be ripe for Israel's picking. They need to remember oil is a finite resource.
9298 2018-12-17 05:57:44 Then why aren't we producing oil?
Why are we shipping dilbit? We should be refining here, selling oil, not bitumen. 

More jobs for Canadians if we refine in Alberta. Less risk in transporting it as well.
9299 2018-12-17 05:57:38 I love robotic oil poffins~!

9301 2018-12-17 05:57:32 You didn't answer my question. Why do you support dirty oil? In fact, why do all the Canadian enviros support dirty oil?
My brother did enviro testing for oil rigs 15-20 years ago that's how the companies here have been caring about mother earth.
9302 2018-12-17 05:57:27 @LBC Steve just drove to Aberdeen to go on an oil rig for 3 weeks. Miss every second of Christmas but still needed to buy presents. Can you feel sorry for me please
9303 2018-12-17 05:57:25 OIL is giving a buy signal, on watch 
9304 2018-12-17 05:57:17 Any such crises will bring the prices of commodities down; i.e. oil, LNG, coal, iron, food items etc & causing deflation.
As Pakistan is a consumer economy, it would reduce our import bill & inflation
9305 2018-12-17 05:57:02 雪がたっぷりかかりましたね～
9306 2018-12-17 05:56:44 I have one as a relic of the oil era: mi e is bigger that that one. Maybe theirs is for typewriters!!
9307 2018-12-17 05:56:42 Doesn’t Irving Oil know their profits would double, maybe triple, if they could refine Canadian (AB/SK) oil? That beside energy independence for Canada
9308 2018-12-17 05:56:36 え？？？

9309 2018-12-17 05:56:36 Love to do or say things that remind me of oil and gas
9310 2018-12-17 05:56:28 Gisugo ko ni mama pagpalit ug oil para sa air purifier. Nya ang tindera wala jud nagtagad sa akoa kay busy pagtanaw sa videos sa Ms U hahahaha
9311 2018-12-17 05:56:27 I did not get the memo for the B-Price ooo. It’s 1 oil bloc we are collecting ooo
9312 2018-12-17 05:56:25 What rules are you referring to? I didn’t realize where I said anything in my tweet about them losing
9313 2018-12-17 05:56:21 So you don't care where it comes from, who gets hurt, or who benefits?

I want oil refined in Alberta right where it's mined. 
I would pay extra for Canada to be energy independent. It would be worth the cost. 

If you disagree, maybe you just don't care much about this country.
9314 2018-12-17 05:55:49 I have no problem with baldness.
I also have no problem making fun of him for putting an oil stain on his head...
...and pretending that it's hair.... 
...and thinking that people wouldn't notice it... 
...while he thinks that he's being intelligent rather than a racist scumbag.
9315 2018-12-17 05:55:48 Dude the last time I had my oil done. It was after me and my dad did it and we put the cap back on too fuckin tight and they spent an hour trying to get it off only to end up breaking it off and charging me $60 for a new one
9316 2018-12-17 05:55:42 A prime rib is always good. You can buy it to size and it’s easy to cook. Allow one rib for two people. 

Bring to room temp. 

Rub with salt, pepper, olive oil and minced garlic. Place bone side down on a rack in pan. 

Roast at 425 for 20 min or so. Reduce oven temp to 325°F.
9317 2018-12-17 05:55:41 One time I had to make 300 brownies and mixed all the batter in one fat bowl but I didn’t realize until AFTER they were baked that I used garlic vegetable oil. 
9318 2018-12-17 05:55:17 Grab a few toilet seat covers to cut up into 2-inch squares. These are great for soaking up excess oil on your face.
9319 2018-12-17 05:55:03 I need to spend tomorrow cleaning my car, getting an oil change and finding a hobby. And probably restarting my medication for the 43rd time
9320 2018-12-17 05:54:53 What product(s) would you recommend for someone with Crohns? Looking at options ( it’s a surprise)for my bf since his oil contains THC and he can’t focus on anything afterward, and it really frustrates him. Sorry if someone already asked!
9321 2018-12-17 05:54:44 okay but u make cake w vinegar instead of oil so
9322 2018-12-17 05:54:40 The surface looked really shiny so maybe it was rubbed with some oil or something. I really want to try that now.
9323 2018-12-17 05:54:39 Yea they do that too...some food trucks deep fry  the tortilla...they bend naturally in the oil
9324 2018-12-17 05:54:35 mau pake skincare lagi tp takut kaya sebelum2nya cuma buang2 duit (aka ga ada yg cocok). regimen sekarang cuma fw + aloe vera + kadang2 squalane oil doang. pengen cerahin muka dikit tapi pake begituan doang mah ga cukup atuh 
9325 2018-12-17 05:54:34 Add a touch more oil to it and put it in a waffle iron. I am curious how well it would waffle.
9326 2018-12-17 05:54:28 In the same way Doctors are emigrating to England, a lot of Oil workers are moving to the Gulf Arab on semi-permanent basis to work. A LOT. Even in our biggest industry, Nigeria is heammorraging labour.
9327 2018-12-17 05:54:06 Too lobsidded in penalty calls.  Maybe a few more Oiler PP the game is closer.  Oh well 6 wins 1 loss is better than 1-6 lol
9328 2018-12-17 05:54:02 Burning the midnight oil #tko
9329 2018-12-17 05:53:56 Y’all I just put coconut oil in my hair as usual except when I grabbed the jar to put it up it slipped and fell and shattered and now I’m experiencing disappointment 
9330 2018-12-17 05:53:46 And I’m also asking about how much prices for our oil would increase if we were shipping via pipeline to eastern Canada instead of to the USA via current means.
9331 2018-12-17 05:53:39 What interests does Rupert Murdoch have in this area? Israel gave oil exploration rights in the occupied Golan Heights to Genie Energy, of which Rupert is a major shareholder. 
Netanyahu offered an Israeli daily paper to the Murdochs. And look at the SkyafterDark take on this...
9332 2018-12-17 05:53:32 I’m not against nuclear or oil; I’m against prolific waste of oil & gas out our tailpipes as we sit at Timmy’s drive thru for  $2.50 coffee. If nuclear is made safe, I’m all ears.
9333 2018-12-17 05:53:23 If Canadians want to prove a point then we should stop importing oil from unethical countries and use our own ethical oil. How can you say dirty oil is bad and then use 300,000 barrels from Saudi Arabia per day in QC alone?
My question to you is why do you support dirty oil?
9334 2018-12-17 05:53:22 Gift Certificate is available at The Oil Paint Store.  use for walk ins & online order. 1 time use only amount of Php200 per code.
9335 2018-12-17 05:53:19 It is a very low quality oil, but lots of it.
9336 2018-12-17 05:53:14 The argument was that there's alternatives to oil and that we should stop expanding and start transitioning. That should be the least controversial thing. 
Do you believe in anthropogenic climate change?
9337 2018-12-17 05:53:03 Only reason trades from the past are brought up is b/c of the unbalanced roster was left in. Nothing more buy certainly nothing less. Contrary to what some like to admit, the aftermath matters.
9338 2018-12-17 05:53:02 The us only cares about its and its partners' own interests, which include keeping under their control of oil and other natural resources of the land and exploiting them!!!
9339 2018-12-17 05:52:32 กินข้าวบ่ได้อีกแล้วเธ๊อ
9340 2018-12-17 05:52:07 4 menit massage pake oil (kalo aku pake baby oil Johnson's)
2 menit pake face wash (klo aku cetaphil)
Terus 4 menit buat ngebilasnya.. Jadi kayak siramin aja mukanya selama 4 menit gitu
9341 2018-12-17 05:51:24 Naaaah! This is my new ‘oiled and shampooed but the oil did not come out’ look 
9342 2018-12-17 05:51:17 このりは1番ピュアで1番可愛いよ
9343 2018-12-17 05:51:00 The real reason the government is dragging its feet over #peoplesvote? (Liam Fox gave it away) It’s that you’d be setting a precedent. Scotland would want another referendum on independence... All that North Sea Oil revenue...

9347 2018-12-17 05:50:29 Venezuela had oil, therefore cash, pumping out of the ground and that wasn't enough to feed the socialism beast. Pot farms are just going to kick the can a few yards down the road.
9348 2018-12-17 05:50:28 @HKRotich  How much has Kenya Made from "Oil Sales" so far? What about the allocation of revenue of these sales to Turkana county? @GovernorNanok ? Back to the topic? Where is the feasibility studies and project paper from @TullowOilKenya These should contain waste disposal plan.
9349 2018-12-17 05:50:23 I’ve done injections without much luck, tried CBD oil as well.
9350 2018-12-17 05:50:07 i could sit in my room for hours with my lil essential oil defuser on & some candles lit just playin my guitar
9351 2018-12-17 05:50:00 anyway back 2 our regularly scheduled voltron until the oil kicks in
9352 2018-12-17 05:49:41 Of course it is but the same rules apply when they're losing as well.
9353 2018-12-17 05:49:36 Best annual performance since 2005 (this from NYT) income is up 3.1% (highest in a decade)China neg trade, NK, prison reform, urban revitalization led by Carson, this week we became a net oil exporter for 1st time in 75 years... I mean does any of this matter? Does to me.

9355 2018-12-17 05:49:19 So in the order of things, let the oil absorb then apply the foundation? Any primer recommended?
9356 2018-12-17 05:49:16 Saudi Arabia, you should be tried for crimes against humanity. The USA needs to get rid of Trump and update our infrastructure to solar and wind power, as well as producing electric cars. No more oil dependence.

9361 2018-12-17 05:48:34 Mr. Josef, I am very big fan of your energy research , i watched your so many shows on BNN but there are lot of energy stock, in this oil downturn if i have to own 3-4 energy oil producers in large/midcap which one you suggest most which gives little protection from downside
9362 2018-12-17 05:48:27 Oil sent to Irving from Saudi Arabia and then refined and sold to Quebec doesn’t make it not a Saudi product.
9363 2018-12-17 05:48:25 but it's not turkana county taking the oil or even benefiting from it.
9364 2018-12-17 05:48:23 beard oil is totally meant for you my sweetums
9365 2018-12-17 05:48:05 Buy an EV and give the middle finger to big oil.

9370 2018-12-17 05:47:30 Petroleum based product. Better to use all-natural coconut oil instead. Natural and smells great.
9371 2018-12-17 05:47:25 So the world leaders have agreed we need to do something about climate change - again. In 2 yrs time they will meet (again) + they might be able to tell each other how they're going to do it. But no matter how you look at it there's only one thing to do - step away from coal +oil
9372 2018-12-17 05:47:20 Tell me how do they keep in touch?   Why did trump destroy 200 mercenaries and places more sanctions on Russia? Why did he tell europe not to buy russian gas and oil? 
9373 2018-12-17 05:47:20 Not much to complain about with tonight's result. Canucks were by far & away the better side. Oilers have had some outbursts of late but on most night's they're not equipped to deal with bad goals against. That makes life awfully tough on their netminders.
9374 2018-12-17 05:47:11 It’s too close together for me to oil ot
9375 2018-12-17 05:47:06 Trump’s energy plan has absolutely helped lower gas prices. For I think the first time in history we are a net oil exporter.

9377 2018-12-17 05:46:48 Now to the steak. When the cast iron pan is piping hot (you'll see some smoking from the pan surface) add a drizzle of olive oil and swirl around. Place the steak in and away from you. If you wanna reduce smoke, lower your stove to medium heat before adding the steak.
9378 2018-12-17 05:46:36 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
9379 2018-12-17 05:46:11 Horvat checked him into the ground or should I say the ice. Next time the Oil have home ice watch for Hitch to keep McDavid away from Horvat. Give credit when it's due. McD is a SUPERB talent and Horvat basically shut him down. Credit to both players

9385 2018-12-17 05:45:26 Salaries in Alberta are also in general a lot higher than in the rest of the country. income taxes are lower and zero PST. But 40 years of PC mismanagement means AB yes is looking at a small deficit, while Norway, is sitting on a $ Trillion oil fund
9386 2018-12-17 05:45:24 Unless the “musk” is Egyptian... from the NOI people selling it in oil form along with the oils, I don’t want it. 
9387 2018-12-17 05:45:22 Been looking for some cbd gummies to get me through the last little stretch of this excruciating pregnancy and all the gummies on Amazon don't actually CONTAIN CBD?? like its literally just hemp oil?? what in the ACTUAL fuck
9388 2018-12-17 05:45:19 Maybe you haven't noticed that it's America that is seeking to destroy the Iranian economy through sanctions and threatens them with war.  The Chinese are trying to... buy their oil.  Which of these things is bad?
9389 2018-12-17 05:44:43 So you guys, as UCP supporters, are saying she shouldn't have invested in oil and gas with the new rail cars.

9392 2018-12-17 05:44:04 You just said “provinces don’t import oil” which is wrong. Nice correcting your mistake now tho 

That “dirty crude” pays for you pricks’ free daycare. Enjoy your $13B/year equalization payments while Albertans straddle the poverty line. 

Sit down, say thank you, and shut up.
9393 2018-12-17 05:44:04 Thats not an authoritarian. People are like that Obama was a below average President yet there are people who think he was the best in history. The US just became the largest oil producer and exporter in the world. He takes credit and people believe him and even retweet it.
9394 2018-12-17 05:44:03 They are fighting over oil, they are fighting by choice. He spoke nothing but the truth
9395 2018-12-17 05:43:58 trying to decide how much I really like OIL OF EVERY PEARL'S UN-INSIDES
9396 2018-12-17 05:43:47 My rep does that, too, but the questions are so slanted it's obvious he's just spewing GOP propaganda. The questions are like (paraphrasing) "Do you agree that we should create American jobs and improve national security by encouraging investment in oil exploration?" Total slant.
9397 2018-12-17 05:43:44 Jobs for labour, organized or not, were always on the radar. And so is a smart and possible path to green energy.

You blocking a pipeline isn't going to magically phase out oil.

But it is going to wipe out the funds we need for investments in transitioning to green energy.
9398 2018-12-17 05:43:28 Add to the bowl a drizzle of olive oil. Not so much that it puddles in the bottom, but a nice even coat. Season nicely with seasoned salt and sprinkle on the roasemary. (About 1 tsp of leaves for 3 potatoes). Toss, throw on an oven tray, in the oven for 20 minutes.
9399 2018-12-17 05:43:28 the exponential growth of EVs starts in 2025, Europe is banning ICEs by 2030.  End of oil will be huge for US politics, economy and foreign policy.

9401 2018-12-17 05:43:14 I can’t believe there are still people who think the oil and gas ban will decrease emissions. 

Kudos to the green PR machine.
9402 2018-12-17 05:43:02 trip ko gumawa ng universe using oil pastel kaso wala naman akong talent sa mga ganyan kaya wag na lang hehehehe :((
9403 2018-12-17 05:42:59 Not sure I was crapping on them. "0 shots" is a stat. Not a good stat, but a stat rather than an opinion. I guess "not feeling it tonight" was an opinion, though to me it seemed more an observation. Not a good game by the Oil on a number of levels. Still made it close
9404 2018-12-17 05:42:46 Is Becky doing an oil check?
9405 2018-12-17 05:42:36 It's made out of eggs and oil. Why use it when the oil is the key?
9406 2018-12-17 05:42:33 Get yourself some peppermint oil and keep it in your purse. Dab it on the back of your neck when you feel the sweats coming on, it works.
9407 2018-12-17 05:42:31 CBD oil it works amazingly for some much stuff
9408 2018-12-17 05:42:29 우정이라는 기계에 잘 정제된 예의라는 기름을 바르는 것은 현명하다.
It is wise to apply the oil of refined politeness to the mechanisms of friendship.

9411 2018-12-17 05:42:22 Trucks roll from Turkey to Iran filled with gold. Trucks roll from Iran to Turkey filled with oil.  Just thought I’d let this ass hat know that even a burned has been has his 1970s sanction avoidance strategies. BTW Zarif, what happened at the Esendere crossing in 2017 lol?
9412 2018-12-17 05:42:04 how hard is it to do a landfill that can handle the oil wastes

9417 2018-12-17 05:41:38 I wonder if there’s some dude with the exact same face as Stephen Miller who’s been smearing the front of his head with cow poo and nasty old motor oil at the hairline so as not to get mistaken for him that’s now furious his ruse will no longer work.
9418 2018-12-17 05:41:36 And destabilize their entire country to steal their oil...

He mentioned wanted new rock climbing shoes (but they're so hard to buy for other people cause sizing is cray)

He ruined some of his other shoes changing the oil in the delica. Cannot find them
9423 2018-12-17 05:40:50 tried doing a hot oil treatment on my hair and now my pillow is REKKKKKKKKKKKK’D
9424 2018-12-17 05:40:47 Do you know Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world !!!!!!!!! They started following socialism and they are doomed to poverty and women sold as sex slaves . Just to tell all of us the importance of what good government will do.
9425 2018-12-17 05:40:46 Uy yes!!! Yung castor oil kasi masyadong oily sa mata pero mabilis naman magwork. Ito naman prang napaka-kapal niya yung tubo :)
9426 2018-12-17 05:40:42 Sometimes @Logan_Stolt dumps garlic oil all over himself. Sometimes it's bloody mary mix. Sometimes sesame oil...

This is not a story of failed foreplay. 

It's just another day at work.

9433 2018-12-17 05:39:35 @trish_regan Thank you so much for this fine interview...and for saying to those who don't know, American engineers, did get the oil out of their ground. We lived there under a democracy, and have prayed it will return to one. 
9434 2018-12-17 05:39:34 Fried rice is just yesterday's cooked rice (or takeout rice) with yesterday's vegetables stir fried together in a little oil. I like sesame oil. Add one fresh thing (like cabbage or tomatoes) and crack an egg into it to fry.

9437 2018-12-17 05:38:42 We made some gorilla glue oil this morning and it’s so fire.
9438 2018-12-17 05:38:00 What's peanut butter and mayo made out of? Oil? Why use the crap when it's all about the oil in the products?
9439 2018-12-17 05:37:44 Pwede ko bang paghalu-haluin yung essential oil sa humidifier? Or like magiging witch hut yung amoy ng room ko? Hahahaha
9440 2018-12-17 05:37:36 Got an oil change, air filter change, & tire rotation. Before all of this my car was fine minus oil change light. Now my car is pulling to the left. I hope they fix this for free & don’t charge me 
9441 2018-12-17 05:37:32 Speaker at GP rally says Alberta puts tofu on the table in Toronto. Besides the stupidity of that comment, at what point is Toronto going to try being a leader and say Canada needs to shut down the oil sands? You are the actual epicentre of Canada. Try using your voice @JohnTory
9442 2018-12-17 05:37:23 A good point. But when you drive less than 2k miles per year and your manufacturer specifies you need to change the oil annually, you don't care about 5k extra miles that you don't use anyway.  (in some countries people drive less than in the US)
9443 2018-12-17 05:37:21 Aren't you Ber-nard the oil worker? Oh, I get it!
You're Rent-a-Mob, just like they do in Europe. 
Hope they're paying you more in dollars than they do in francs for the yellow jackets over there.

9446 2018-12-17 05:36:49 So, this power seige. That happened then was just more than central banks, oil, it was to control the human slave routes.

9451 2018-12-17 05:35:50 I too swear by Oil of Olay for sensitive skin.
9452 2018-12-17 05:35:40 He refuses to answer the questions surrounding Saudi oil...he is full of political doublespeak to evade!
9453 2018-12-17 05:35:36 Presumably that is what the court case which is going to take place on California (lots of towns v various oil companies) is also going to tease out...

9456 2018-12-17 05:35:15 You DO realize that China and Russia have actually been working TOGETHER for decades on trade, energy, military weapons, oil, gas and joint nuclear facilities right?
9457 2018-12-17 05:35:02 This is coming from the individual who tried ppl with that bio oil! 
9458 2018-12-17 05:34:31 skip the olive oil and substitute some non-oil
9459 2018-12-17 05:33:19 This is like a flapper "Where's Waldo"? Find the bottle of three-in-one oil, the tiny statue of a house and the guy about to put his hand in some woman's hair. So many questions!! What's with the woman in the British Bobby Helmet? Do they all work in this one room?

9463 2018-12-17 05:33:03 Ice water helps! You could also drink some tea and put some peppermint oil on your temples. But if it's a tension headache, you can put a pencil in your teeth and massage your temples to try and unclench your jaw
9464 2018-12-17 05:32:57 put it on a sheet pan with some olive oil and S&P and any other type of spice you enjoy and bake it at 450F for 20 minutes or something

9470 2018-12-17 05:32:16 The powder, that stuff smells wonderful after it vents. But that oil shit, I didn't know several cops were spraying my whole back, I grabbed my bandana out of my pocket, psh. Heat again. Put my hat back on, psh, heat again. Turned it around. Heat again.

9473 2018-12-17 05:32:12 How on earth do you justify expanding oil production? At the very least, shouldn't any sane person want continue them, remove subsides and tax breaks and invest in renewables --aka our survival?

9479 2018-12-17 05:31:27 Even if it’s true it that all of if oil related jobs won’t exist in 50 years, it doesn’t make sense to put 100k oil related workers out of work in the short term.

9481 2018-12-17 05:31:23 The Liberal climate change agenda is about controlling Alberta oil exports. It keeps the C$ low and facilitates manufacturing exports from vote rich Quebec & Ontario. Productivity is so low in those provinces their exports can’t compete without a steep foreign exchange discount.

9483 2018-12-17 05:31:13 He also skips how much less Saudi oil would be processed in New Brunswick had the Energy East pipeline not been buried under an avalanche of "upstream" regulations. And shipping oil is much safer than a pipeline right?
9484 2018-12-17 05:30:56 Infuriating and sickening when some comes around and say - "let me tap from your anointing" - like some oil pipeline vandals??? Lol
9485 2018-12-17 05:30:40 And yet, as far as people tearing down our government, what about all of the complicit GOPers: McConnell, Ryan, the Federalist Society, Evangelicals, FOX not-News, they've all been chipping away at our liberties for years. Oh. And Scott Walker. Big Oil, ...

9495 2018-12-17 05:30:03 Not a ban.  A tariff on all oil from outside NAFTA producers.  Make it a good 25-50% tariff. So it tips the playing field to level.  The Irving’s can import if they like but it will cost them 50% more.
9496 2018-12-17 05:29:58 EGYPT TransGlobe Energy plans to develop an oil discovery made by its South Ghazalat (SGZ) 6X exploration well in Egypt’s Western Desert. During tests, the well flowed at a combined rate of 3,840 b/d of light oil
9497 2018-12-17 05:29:58 You do know that our oil and gas ban is resulting in increased emissions don't you? Instead of making up electricity shortfalls with low emissions gas, we now use coal....and our high grade oil which Australia was buying from us, they're going to buy lower grade from someone else
9498 2018-12-17 05:29:41 We do with no soap and lukewarm water just a dip and then a deep lotion rub down as part of bedtime ritual. We use cetaphil soap 2x a week only. Lots of aquaphor and coconut oil after each warm dip!
9499 2018-12-17 05:29:27 Once again due to outside influence and pressure Alberta's Oil doesn't have a fighting chance on the West Coast.
9500 2018-12-17 05:29:23 Needless to say, I have always believed that for an ex-president, a former oil minister, a former PTF chairman, an ex-army general cannot come out in Nigeria and claim he is so broke that he only has 2 houses he borrowed to build and 150 cows, he's either bad with funds or a lair

9505 2018-12-17 05:28:21 I'm curious how people square the circle of "gas taxes are unacceptable because of the impact on the car-dependent working class" + "we need to stop fracking and otherwise extracting oil"; why is one policy that raises the price of gas bad, and the other good?
9506 2018-12-17 05:28:11 “We love  oil” Oh ok. I thought for a second there you cared about the future of your grandkids and demanding your provincial government give you jobs revolving around CLEAN energy but I was wrong.

9522 2018-12-17 05:25:25 Great points. It’s a real chicken and egg thing...is Quebec’s misguided rejection of Alberta oil a product of Alberta’s generally fact-free scapegoating of Quebec, or vice versa?
9523 2018-12-17 05:25:20 (*´Д｀*)
9524 2018-12-17 05:25:07 Fennel essential oil is what I use  It works wonders!

9538 2018-12-17 05:23:03 My hair stylist at the salon rubbing essential oil into my scalp and temples: wow you’re so tense have u been stressed? I can tell u didn’t sleep well these last few days
Me: HAVE I BEEN STRESSED
9539 2018-12-17 05:22:50 My daughter reacts to a lot of medication.  She has Lyme disease and we have tried non THC cbd oil a couple times but it makes her absolutely loopy. Is there a better alternative that she might not react to.
9540 2018-12-17 05:22:13  you a fool for that, but coconut oil bro
9541 2018-12-17 05:22:07 He is already making plans to buy up land. Same as Bush family in South America. Where the last fresh water supply is left. Trumpet is planning to frack and log. But the shipping lanes are the biggest money. Oil!!!!
9542 2018-12-17 05:22:06 Hilarious how you don’t want our dirty oil but you hammer our oil cheque based transfer payments in your broke ass province. Businesses leaving at a high rate. And I don’t see you driving all electric cars. And you pump your raw sewage into the st lawrence. Good job!!!
9543 2018-12-17 05:22:06 Tarte maracuja GOLD oil is my holy grail for the winter!
9544 2018-12-17 05:21:59 i bought a lavender essential oil air freshener for my room and it is the best decision i've made.
9545 2018-12-17 05:21:52 And I bet they are all protesting the oil industry being subsidized, a raise in the minimum raise, and a compassionate immigration policy for asylum seekers just like their counterparts in France are doing.
9546 2018-12-17 05:21:43 Don’t go away Oil fans
9547 2018-12-17 05:21:43 Which in turn creates more equalization money for Quebec. Also doesn't take oil to NB refineries
9548 2018-12-17 05:21:41 Rapeseed oil is now known as canola oil.
9549 2018-12-17 05:21:32 So Norway a bit of a mixed bag - fantastic with their own energy usage, EVs etc but poor in terms of subsidising oil exploration to export?
9550 2018-12-17 05:21:24 I live in Alberta and don't take "your" money. That and the former part of your sentence is wildly incoherent. I'll have to get an uneducated oil rig worker to decipher it.
9551 2018-12-17 05:21:21 Heck, lots of Americans don't even realize NM is part of the US. The oil companies doing all the drilling in the Permian Basin probably wouldn't like it, though.
9552 2018-12-17 05:20:56 I want to get my kid some CBD oil.
9553 2018-12-17 05:20:54 Sir a farm worker is earning $89 by gvt approved salary. How is that person, add his family, supposed to live when basic commodities have gone up by 3 to 400%.? A bottle of coke costs $1, rice $7 cooking oil $10. Where are we going as a nation give us a signal.
9554 2018-12-17 05:20:23 I’ve found that Lavender essential oil really helps me to breathe and calm down. Mumsy also gave me a supplement that helps.
9555 2018-12-17 05:20:22 @KittyJaguarXXX tried the coconut oil, it was actually quite smooth.
9556 2018-12-17 05:20:18 My refrigerator is now at home but because the motor oil has to settle for 3-4 hours and I have to leave it plugged for another hour without switching it on, it seems like i'll have to postpone storing my lovely bacon and ham in it. This is causing my desire to file a sick leave.
9557 2018-12-17 05:19:34 Before tidur urut2 badan dia pakai bedtime lotion/oil. Make sure dada, belakang badan, tapak kaki and perut sapu yu yee elak dia kembung.

9560 2018-12-17 05:19:00 We know what the Republican Party is about. It’s about big oil, protecting rich families, white males and big business, accumulating wealth any way possible, and taking away health care from non-rich Americans. Trump completely represents today’s Republican Party.
9561 2018-12-17 05:18:59 Eating a slice of bread with oil before star drinking helps as well... 
9562 2018-12-17 05:18:48 I just can't. He's a precious cupcake who deserves the perfect icing to top him off. Not motor oil

9570 2018-12-17 05:17:52 I agree! CBD oil has helped me tremendously, mine has no THC in it but pot can help some people greatly improve their quality of life!!
9571 2018-12-17 05:17:31 #UnsolicitedAdvice Soak your #brownrice a few hours before cooking. Add #vinegar to keep it from spoiling too quickly. Add #oil (any unsaturated kind). #ThatsHowIDo
9572 2018-12-17 05:17:11 I’ve added sage, lemon zest, soy sauce, sesame oil, oyster sauce to the pork mince for tea. Not sure if it’ll work. Steamed Carrots, cabbage, silverbeet and brown rice to have with it.
9573 2018-12-17 05:17:07 Did you have some motor oil dressing with your salad too?
9574 2018-12-17 05:17:05 Trevor and friends distract from the issue.  It don't matter if it's Saudi oil. It's about selling more of ours period
9575 2018-12-17 05:16:56 @huffpostpol @democracynow @bpolitics @nytimes   Everyone but trump knows the disasterous state the earth is in from fossil fuels because as Eric T said in 2015"most of our income is from oil deals with have with Russia"

9578 2018-12-17 05:16:31 It’s just bizarre.  He is just so so far outside the core ethos of Gen X.  His fake sincerity and alliances with obvious snake oil salesmen mark him as a classic political operator.
9579 2018-12-17 05:16:15 Oil is a non renewable energy. Saudi arabia has sunny days most of the year and abundant resources to deploy such a project as well sand of which solar panels are made of. Saudi plan is inclined to invest more in petrochemicals instead of exporting raw oil.
9580 2018-12-17 05:16:10 And who is going to pay for panels that have at least a 20 year payback?   Unless oil is $200 a barrel or these panels are 70% cheaper to install, get used to hydrocarbon energy.
9581 2018-12-17 05:16:02 and finally tsubaki/camellia oil for my oil cleansing and my hair - when i found the right oil for my skin and care, they just LIVEEED
9582 2018-12-17 05:15:33 Three supermajor companies now own the rights to the Standard name in the United States: ExxonMobil, Chevron Corp., and BP. BP acquired its rights through acquiring Standard Oil of Ohio and Amoco, and has a small handful of stations in the Midwestern United States

9584 2018-12-17 05:15:30 I have a lot of anxiety when im in large crowds which makes me nervous when I try to talk to people. Is there any specific oil or flour I could take for that?

9587 2018-12-17 05:14:49 Nov trade deficit was $2.05b ~ $735m deficit. 
- Exports fell 3.28% y/y; est. +3.00%
- Manufacturing triggered annual decline, while oil & gas led monthly decline
- Imports rose 11.68% y/y; est. +9.70%
- Raw materials/intermediary goods boosted yearly import, capital goods fell
9588 2018-12-17 05:14:46 On-going failure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from coal, oil and gas, globally and here in Australia, has already negatively affected Australia’s water security and will increasingly affect it into the future.

9591 2018-12-17 05:14:20 Olive oil coarse sea salt fresh coarse ground black pepper. Medium rare yes. Side of asparagus perhaps browned in the same pan with some garlic.
9592 2018-12-17 05:14:20 Standard Oil of Louisiana of Shreveport, Louisiana was created in 1909 as a subsidiary of Standard Oil of New Jersey (Esso, now part of ExxonMobil), a part of the Standard Oil trust.

9604 2018-12-17 05:11:57 Might want to rethink how you approach this topic.  Saudi oil surely isn't imported to the west
9605 2018-12-17 05:11:53 Its history as one of the world's first and largest multinational corporations ended in 1911, when the United States Supreme Court, in a landmark case, ruled that Standard Oil was an illegal monopoly.
9606 2018-12-17 05:11:33 It’s all good! Can you recommend the best product, specifically an oil or edible, for seizures?
9607 2018-12-17 05:11:27 Standard Oil Co. Inc. was an American oil producing, transporting, refining, and marketing company. Established in 1870 by John D. Rockefeller and Henry Flagler as a corporation in Ohio, it was the largest oil refinery in the world of its time.
9608 2018-12-17 05:11:19 So is the hypothesis that Qatar is laundering Iranian oil contracts and DB is insuring the sale?

9615 2018-12-17 05:10:17 B.S. Refineries in the East buy their crude from wherever they can get the best price. They also may not be tooled for our oil here in Alberta. This is more crap from you to cover the poor job you and Harper did with pipelines when you had the mandate to do so. More UCP crap.

9618 2018-12-17 05:10:00 That will be useless. Russia and China would just sell them all the arms they need. If countries are serious they would ban their oil & gas. That would get their attention.

9659 2018-12-17 05:04:06 Which is why the oil industry's own climate scientists were pointing out that Global Warming / Climate Change from fossil carbon (dumped as CO2) was actually a problem -- in the 1970's

(PS: first published calculations of climate sensitivity to CO2 were 1896, 1906)
9660 2018-12-17 05:03:56 Full belly and CBD oil... about to sleep like a baby 
9661 2018-12-17 05:03:53 Wish I had a clue before spouting. Please explain how stopping pipeline does anything for climate. Oil not produced by Alberta, with some of the highest Enviro stds in world, will be produces and sold by someone else. And why r u on producers? It's consumers who spew the GHGs
9662 2018-12-17 05:03:52 Ooooh this essential oil blend is like sex dust.
9663 2018-12-17 05:03:49 I took my CBD oil orally instead of vaping it. Time to melt into my bed.

9665 2018-12-17 05:03:24 Full market price to import US oil into Eastern Canada yet you continue to obstruct export and transnational pipelines, forcing us to sell our (Alberta’s) oil at a significant discount. Recipe for discontent! Fact do matter.
9666 2018-12-17 05:03:24 @jacksoncrompton you sir have caused your municipality millions of $$, your comments show how ignorant/stupid/lack of knowledge you have about the oil sands,but you will soon see the effects when ALL oil and gas boycott ur town #boycottwhistler
9667 2018-12-17 05:03:14 Modern nuclear is a lot safer than the older plants and should be considered as an interim solution. Geothermal has lots of potential. The big thing is to stop taking "donations" from and subsidizing coal oil and gas and start transitioning to clean energy. It's cheaper!
9668 2018-12-17 05:02:59 Oil bowls save lifes
9669 2018-12-17 05:02:56 You posted the wrong interview-Trudeau hates OIL & he hates the WEST more. Your letting him take you down with him. If it wasn’t so sad it would be laughable. Your the worst representative we have EVER had from Alberta. Bring on October, one&done!
9670 2018-12-17 05:02:55 Oil Services made up largest portion my watchlist already for last yr so have been waiting for this type of dumpster fire to occur

9675 2018-12-17 05:01:59 We finally saw oil prices stabilize a bit in a midweek recovery, edging up a bit higher in anticipation of a global supply crunch.
Last week's OPEC meeting resulted in the cartel and its partners agreeing to cut crude oil production by around 1.2 million barrels a day

After I used it up I made my own version with chamomile tea/apple cider vinegar and a couple months ago I added some rose oil with vitamin c to it. Tonight I used it as deodorant.

9702 2018-12-17 04:57:57 Because the historical record shows the exact opposite. Are you actually willing to believe that the oil crisis in Canada right now can be blamed on Trudeau or Notley, and not 40 years of conservative mismanagement that preceded it?

9711 2018-12-17 04:56:32 I am a proud employee of the oil and gas industry in Canada. Canadian oil is ethically and environmentally responsibly produced. It should be sold all over the world! #energy #canadianoilandgas

9714 2018-12-17 04:55:12 I'm tired of politics and politicians, we Iranians have to fight with every politician because we have oil and this oil has not been relaxed for us anywhere in the world ...

9722 2018-12-17 04:54:13 Thank you! I used coconut oil and sugar
9723 2018-12-17 04:54:07 If that’s true, that would mean they get all their Oil from the same place they get all their Money !
9724 2018-12-17 04:54:03 Christ that's stupid. There are alternatives already. The only lacking part is political will.
We have 12 years to avoid climate breakdown.  There's no sane was to propose expanding oil production.
9725 2018-12-17 04:53:59 It s simple. Grind coconut, (3-4 pieces), 10-15 cashew, til, khaskhas jeera, pepper, saunf (fennel seeds)and salt. Stuff the brinjals with paste, allow it to cook on low flame in oil. Health warning, be a little generous with the oil to get best results. Use EVOO!

9730 2018-12-17 04:53:17 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
9731 2018-12-17 04:53:13 First, we’d have to end our dependence on oil or at least limit our demand to what we and our friendliest allies produce. Next, we’d have to do something about Iran. If you think Israel is defensive now, wait until Iran steps up its threats.
9732 2018-12-17 04:53:04 Ahhh. Well the Oil have been playing pretty good lately so even tonight it’s hard to be too mad at them. As for the real life stuff, hope you come out of it on top. I think you will. You are pretty awesome
9733 2018-12-17 04:52:51 Applying coconut oil to your hair & skin before bed is such a nice feeling

9736 2018-12-17 04:52:30 Huge, so-called humanitarian agencies like the U.N. are hotbeds of corruption. I just watched 'Backstabbing for Beginners' which led me to research the 'oil for food' scandal of the early part of the century. 1/4

9740 2018-12-17 04:52:17 Canada losing 80 million a day because Quebec blocks a Pipeline is insane.
More insane Quebec uses foreign oil.

9744 2018-12-17 04:52:01 If you’re an American, you’re already a Communist in a sense through taxation. You’ve bailed out your big banks and automakers and practically own big oil and other multinationals through #corporateeelfare. This is why the proletariat are so angry: they see so much inequality.
9745 2018-12-17 04:51:57 It was both cringy and funny when 2008 obummer suddenly forgot what his healthcare plan was about after a teleprompter turned off. After weeks of campaigning to gullibles, he couldn't even remember its basics. Sounds like a conartist pushing snake oil with unknown ingredients.

9747 2018-12-17 04:51:45 I mean, they're not wrong... Some machines like lathes may even produce smoke when technically operated correctly but using cutting oil instead of proper coolant...
9748 2018-12-17 04:51:35 Gotta oil change this week now I just gotta get an alignment
9749 2018-12-17 04:51:31 To be honest, I don't much care that we get a "Democrat" as president.  In fact, I believe the OIL that keeps this raggedy corrupt machinery running  are  the Dems. Without them keeping things well oiled, it would rust and  grind to a halt.
9750 2018-12-17 04:51:29 123,000 something my oil change coming up at 124,000 something  calling to make an appointment this week or next

9759 2018-12-17 04:50:51 The only ones criticizing oil are the leftist in Montréal who dont even have a car, never get of their fantasy island, and get all the attention from the MSM (also in downtown MTL). The others are the ones in the real world, with cars and trucks which they need for their family.
9760 2018-12-17 04:50:45 No more “foreign oil” needs, while most of Sask, non-fuel, production stays intact, and switches to Asphalt, plastics/composites, and solvent supply(which heavy crude is perfect for).    Sask loses almost nothing in switching to green power.  It gains a whole lot more.

She said it's something to do with having someone there that can just hold her tight and comforting her that helps alot
9768 2018-12-17 04:49:49 This is it Sean. I had lost it.  Many thanks. This best describes Hatch, Utah, and the theft of over 2 Million acres of our precious public lands and the oil leases that followed. Worse than Teapot Dome. Utah = Enemy of Public Lands.
9769 2018-12-17 04:49:46 I just accidentally dumped out a hundred dollar worth of thc oil. I’m so sad.
9770 2018-12-17 04:49:45 Unlike 400,000 oil and gas workers, Notley has not yet lost her job, neither has Justin. Perhaps that could change in 2019...
9771 2018-12-17 04:49:39 Still need pipelines, for the record we don’t produce enough oil for Refineries? Also we already upgrade most of our oil. Only a few select trade WCS or bitumen. Refineries just add to the glut of oil
9772 2018-12-17 04:49:30 Yes JD, I want the oil sands to be stopped & Canada to only import foreign dictator oil to become even more dependent than we are now. You got me. I'm on OPECs side in this.

•Apply an oil or moisture-based mask treatment weekly.
•Consider trying hair-boosting supplements.
•Brush your hair like it's made from gold. Constant brushing can cause physical harm to it.

Also, this angry mob stuff isn't attractive or helpful for the oil sector either. It would only drive business and investment away.

So, um, good luck with that.

9798 2018-12-17 04:47:23 Have had the high bid at the end of each of the closings and u continue it for 5 mins more over and over. By far the worst auction rules ever! If ppl get outbid last minute that’s their fault for not putting in a max bid. Is this another way for u to get money out of customers?
9799 2018-12-17 04:47:16 I Pray, watch the videos I put in my “happy” folder on insta, meditate, diffuse peppermint and lemon essential oil, do something productive or something I enjoy, talk about it with someone, think of solutions.
9800 2018-12-17 04:47:16 Oh and don’t worry. Quebec will still be able to import Saudi oil.
9801 2018-12-17 04:47:05 Chef Gusteau cut up some rotten zucchini, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was chicken, along with Play-Doh.

9807 2018-12-17 04:46:43 Now months before the election you care about Alberta’s oil industry. I call BS
9808 2018-12-17 04:46:39 When is AMRN going to get this mineral oil fake news squashed?   Take someone to court.  I’m guessing it’s BP trying to keep the stock price down.  Sb illegal
9809 2018-12-17 04:46:19 I use the argan oil one only when I want to straighten my hair so it won’t smell burnt.

9811 2018-12-17 04:46:06 exactly, but of course later; any nation that doesn't share their oil at the right negotiated dictates.
9812 2018-12-17 04:45:49 Yo some cranberry juice will be so oil rn. I'm mad asl we don't live close to the am nm.

9815 2018-12-17 04:45:23 They have to have their favourite players to work with and coaches. I think with kassian, lucic and mcdavid the refs love to hate on the oil. It’s a fucked up league when that puke tkachuk can get all the calls in the world. Or Marchand for that matter.

9820 2018-12-17 04:44:55 Hola, it's Olive Oil. You've been wondering if after all these decades you'd like to rely on that body-ody-ody.
9821 2018-12-17 04:44:52 グリンチみたいんだけど近所の映画館吹き替え版しかやってなくてさー（大泉洋の声が苦手）
9822 2018-12-17 04:44:39 "The whitest and nastiest things in the world cannot be ingested or even fondled - they must be kissed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
9823 2018-12-17 04:44:25 This is not different than what some arab govts do to keep youth engaged in unproductive "research" work on govt payrols to stop them from becoming terrorists. But do we have the Oil money?
9824 2018-12-17 04:44:24 We have a lot of ICE engine, oil company lovers puking garbage all over these feeds.  Clearly never driven a Tesla before or they’d silent.  If you have under a 7 IQ please refrain from posting.  That should clean things up.
9825 2018-12-17 04:44:14 I can see my skin and I know my colors. I'm sorry not all of us had time to put on our makeup and oil our beards.
9826 2018-12-17 04:44:11 Because old people stink and are full of bad ideas that have bankrupt the country and sent generations of young people to fight wars in every corner of the planet for oil so that they can have an easy ride in an SUV to walk laps at the mall.
9827 2018-12-17 04:43:52 Maybe if I curl my hair enough it'll burn all the grease out like setting an oil spill on fire
9828 2018-12-17 04:43:25 "One area of consensus among analysts and traders: crude oil will drag sugar wherever it goes, up or down."
9829 2018-12-17 04:43:06 OK. Turkana to do 100% waste management but keep 5 or is it 6%  of oil benefits nice!
9830 2018-12-17 04:43:06 Pat dry with paper towel and rub with olive oil lightly to get nice browning. Finish in oven in cast iron.
9831 2018-12-17 04:43:02 I was supposed to get an oil change and a hair cut this weekend. guess how many of those things I did 
9832 2018-12-17 04:43:00 形状や性能は値段によりけりではありますが、大体1万円以下からありますね。

9835 2018-12-17 04:42:44 If your economy is oil based why would you move into green energy at a time when you need oil revenues to cover your ever growing budget deficits
9836 2018-12-17 04:42:30 I would love to try oil painting but turpentine scares me
9837 2018-12-17 04:42:29 I mean what should I do with the coconut oil...but I don't have any coconut oil..
9838 2018-12-17 04:42:23 I was trying to add alittle extra Lavender oil to my air purifier/humidifier just now and I by accident put like 5 drops and now my room smells like a Vervane Garden. No vampires for me

9843 2018-12-17 04:41:56 How much government land did he sell to the highest oil bidder? The ranchers will be happy when they don’t have grazing land, or have to pay to private entities for grazing. The fee for grazing will definitely be higher than the federal government.
9844 2018-12-17 04:41:55 They're actually called oil sands.

9848 2018-12-17 04:41:17 Having worked in it for 35 years I get it.  I just grew a conscious and got out to oil and gas to a variety of reasons including human survival
9849 2018-12-17 04:41:02 oh that’s fun i like oil paints these days even though i used to hate them?? so for 3d aspects would u be doing like sculpture or like installation and stuff? i kinda love the way IB art is tbh it seems like theres a lot of freedom in the mediums and stuff which is so fun

9854 2018-12-17 04:40:21 Now the Refs are blocking the Oil flow to the coast
9855 2018-12-17 04:40:15 Between Christmas & needing to replace my brakes & being due for an oil change, I’m going to have to figure out how to make some extra cash while I wait for payday

9862 2018-12-17 04:38:19 Can we trust such reports?  What are they talking about? Organic IS the conventional before they poisoned our food with chemicals and GMOs.  We know Big Pharma Big Agra Big Oil plan to take over pretty much everything, climate change being bad for us is just another ploy.
9863 2018-12-17 04:38:16 Liberty or guitar man - which do you prefer?  Oil and gas is not perfect - but we are all people who love this planet and the environment.  We produce at the highest regulatory, environmental, and ethical standards.  Try to live without it. We stop producing when demand stops.

9867 2018-12-17 04:37:44 I don't live in QC. Facts are the province is setting up for shale drilling but waterways and people are priorities. They do take more oil from AB than anywhere else. No oil comes from Saudi Arabia, and 80% of the oil from the ME is refined and sold in the US. 
9868 2018-12-17 04:37:41 Really it was popularized in Later Chola time in South Asia. Dont bring that it was present from start of planet bullshit. Even RIg veda was not that old and dates to Gupta period. So please sell snake oil some where else

9873 2018-12-17 04:37:01 I usually do better with oil paints... but I can work with gouache and water colors as well nowadays? But our teacher made us try out printmaking, and we need to do like seperate 2D, 3D and film/photography pieces as well

9879 2018-12-17 04:36:05 Probably because he got thrown out of Oil Can Harry’s
9880 2018-12-17 04:35:54 Animals should be killed humanely and painlessly. Then covered in olive oil, salt and pepper, and BBQ'd to medium-rare.
9881 2018-12-17 04:35:44 The #Arabic word for Olive is the source ( زيتون / Zaytun ) of the word for olive in #Spanish (aceituna) and is also related to the word for edible oil in both languages.

9883 2018-12-17 04:35:38 You’re not making any sense. Maybe we need you to get a MMSE, a drug test or all of the above. I read that you think SNL is a news show. You seem very paranoid. Maybe you should try essential oil.
9884 2018-12-17 04:35:26 Oh yeah girl. Steam with lemon oil and some charcoal will just buff the asthma right out
9885 2018-12-17 04:35:10 Tea Tree oil helps hair loss and makes your hair healthier and become thicker so it’ll grow faster!:)

Who's ever used THC infused coconut oil as lube? Did you get high?  How was it?
9890 2018-12-17 04:34:08 Wishing my headache would go away. I've tried mint oil, naps, and 2 doses of Tylenol throughout the day 
9891 2018-12-17 04:33:53 fresh out the shower, body glistening from the coconut oil, hair drippin from the green tea oil, i’m oiled up and tired asl but i got shit to do.
9892 2018-12-17 04:33:42 I was looking for snake oil??
9893 2018-12-17 04:33:31 I don't think saudi Arabia will be interested in making this deal we can have better deal somewhere else
Around 2005 late king Abdullah have priority to American companies for concessions to explore oil & gas in #ksa 
The arrogance of the #US companies got the (0) concessions
9894 2018-12-17 04:33:06 Irving refinery does get Saudi oil however. And, thru NB it eventually gets used in Quebec. Lots of selective use of stats here.
9895 2018-12-17 04:33:00 Good morning! Oil&Gas customers of mine. WTI Crude Oil (10/03/2015): 48,29 USD/barrel. BRENT (10/03/2015): 56,39 USD/barrel.
9896 2018-12-17 04:32:55 We have no oil resources , then how could be like this
9897 2018-12-17 04:32:44 So trains are better? You guys have lots of pipelines already, eh. Oil is dirty but necessary... sort of like sewage treatment. You want your province pristine but take money from provinces willing to exploit their resources? I am done with you. Try to read more diverse material.
9898 2018-12-17 04:32:27 So 1. Shampoo 2. Condition 3. Deep conditioning treatment 4. Mosturizer 5. Gel 6. (Optional) our some oil in your hands and rub them through your hair to lock in moisture.
9899 2018-12-17 04:32:17 You seem to only post pro pipeline/oil tweets. That’s a little odd.
9900 2018-12-17 04:32:03 Not only are we going to continue to be a next exporter of oil, we might get a shot at the #1 spot.
9901 2018-12-17 04:32:01 someone tell me why i just randomly covered the entire upper half of my body in coconut oil bc it made my skin shiny.....no real reason other than it looked pretty
9902 2018-12-17 04:31:58 I don't have a garage....all I have is a carport...with a car in it...that needs an oil change among other things.

9909 2018-12-17 04:30:59 I would use a compress of bentonite clay and water, till just wet, and put in and cover for 24 hours. It will draw out the infection though you may have to do it more than once. Also. Tea tree oil is a good antimicrobial. You have to use something to kill the rest of the bacteria
9910 2018-12-17 04:30:52 With respect Trevor, it seems to me another financial benefit would be in selling Alberta & Sask oil at higher prices since the large discounts would be largely, if not entirely diminished. Hoping you will study and publish findings on this.

Canada = 1..6% of world carbon emissions (b/w 2008-2013)
Time to get things in line.

PS: stat doesn't include emissions from the oil and trash we ship abroad
9917 2018-12-17 04:30:16 Well you have oil taking a hit which is helpful. The whole 'long way to neutral' was incredibly dumb and he shouldn't have said that. But jacking rates up thru the 10 year makes zero sense. The right thing imo is to wait until the 10 yr can sustain a yld of 3.2% before next hike.
9918 2018-12-17 04:30:09 I have a horrible time with moisturizer. I’ve been using Marula oil with decent results.

9920 2018-12-17 04:29:44 I'm very uncomfortable using the power of the state to suppress legal protest. If the oil companies and their trade associations don't like be opposed, they are welcome to get into the trenches and engage British Columbians with better data, science, and argument.

9925 2018-12-17 04:29:08 QC isn't blocking us. 80% of the oil that goes into the province is N. American and over half of that comes from Alberta. That they want clean water and no drilling sites sitting in neighborhoods shld be a given everywhere really.

9937 2018-12-17 04:27:35 When will the ethnically 5% of Syria population return along w/ ISIS the billions of oil stolen taken to Turkey than on to the Isreal for great profits?  Do you think they even got Obombers warning leaflets and nary a bomb up their thieving behinds?

9940 2018-12-17 04:27:09 WHO will buy this oil? Correct answer: Nobody.
9941 2018-12-17 04:27:07 Someone said he’s taking credit for our sudden oil boom too. I haven’t fact checked that though.
9942 2018-12-17 04:27:06 ive been to oil city and it was legitimately the most depressing place ive ever been to in the united states
9943 2018-12-17 04:26:23 Inom ng canola oil bastos to si wally

9944 2018-12-17 04:26:02 Memories are short.

When oil prices were high, Alberta was OUTRAGED that they were asked to give a price break to other Canadian provinces (and *still* outraged over it).
Yet today, they're OUTRAGED that those other provinces prefer to buy cleaner, cheaper oil from elsewhere.

9945 2018-12-17 04:26:00 I have the hardest time swallowing the larger pills so I mostly have to bite into them and I just bought some fish oil capsules that are half the size of my thumbs 
9946 2018-12-17 04:25:51 Need to fight the eco NGO's and the foreign funding (money laundering) coming from Global eco NGO's attacking Canada's resource industries (Salmon Farming, Oil & Gas, Forestry....)
9947 2018-12-17 04:25:48 Hahahahha canola oil ung iinumin jusko hahahaha

9948 2018-12-17 04:25:41 Thwarting the plan for a recession by archaic oil fundamentalists. There is a full on barrage against the petroleum industry on a global scale and we are winning. This is big oils threat to innovation. Almost hysterical regarding oil's feeble attempt because of its predictability
9949 2018-12-17 04:25:13 午後休マン参上！！！
9950 2018-12-17 04:25:08 That's why all the Indian oil petrol pumps refused to sell petrol yesterday in Chennai.
9951 2018-12-17 04:25:03 I've got nothing right now. I'm gonna be up burning the midnight oil over this.
9952 2018-12-17 04:24:59 わかる！すてき！ヤッタネ(調子ライダー)

9958 2018-12-17 04:23:53 Assume that @HillaryClinton was elected !! What will be the situation now , oil price . Iran situation and the relation with Russia . He is working very smart
9959 2018-12-17 04:23:30 If you work in the oil industry and can’t afford a few cents more a litre you have bigger things to worry about than a carbon tax.
9960 2018-12-17 04:23:22 I use sesame oil a lot. Not sure all Asian chili oils use it as a base but the ones I use do
9961 2018-12-17 04:23:01 Motte got crunched by Lucic behind Oil net. Getting checked over by medical staff at #canucks bench
9962 2018-12-17 04:22:57 Wonderful so they buy from the US at full price while US interests fund CDN Activists to ensure CDN oil gets sold to US at discount?
9963 2018-12-17 04:22:55 Try black seed oil, it really works 
9964 2018-12-17 04:22:55 Ooohhhh! The dump! We have great dumps down here in Georgia...people regularly toss out antiques, aka old junk to the average southerner (apparently)  one time I found a box of antique oil lamps(squee!)
9965 2018-12-17 04:22:45 oh no!! olive oil, coconut oil, vegetable oil/shortening. neosporin! butter!! chamomile tea compress when they feel a bit better too might help
9966 2018-12-17 04:22:40 I’m wearing an essential oil called voodoo queen and I wish I could take a fucking bath in it.
9967 2018-12-17 04:22:33 Used motor oil.
9968 2018-12-17 04:22:30 It's not a hoax! 97% of scientists agree, most of the world is working towards solutions while we sit around scratching our collective asses and letting the coal and oil industries run point on this issue instead of the government.
9969 2018-12-17 04:22:25 Thus type of report is prepared for agenda only, do you remember that a report has also been prepared that said coconut oil is poisonous for cooking, you should provide your energy for street children that don't get food
9970 2018-12-17 04:22:17 Exfoliate your face, neck and hands with a mixture of baking soda and olive oil. It is very gentle, and keeps skin very soft and smooth.
9971 2018-12-17 04:22:16 Ang kintab ng shoulders ni Maine  gi butngan na nimog baby oil? Hahahahahahahaha

9972 2018-12-17 04:22:12 @sammendes what’s up with mr robot. What, do u need an oil can
9973 2018-12-17 04:22:08 theyre not trash now.. oil money doesnt really matter. ppl are going to look at numbers and trophies when it comes to history
9974 2018-12-17 04:22:06 my oil infuser has arrived 
9975 2018-12-17 04:21:58 Truly said.. Well made pasta with the right herbs and good olive oil can make all the difference! And us Indians even have that abomination - ready to eat pasta like Maggi pazzta.. Which should be made illegal!
9976 2018-12-17 04:21:56 As peppermint oil is both an irritant and a scent:
1. Apply to bottom's nipples.
2. Clip nipples.
3. Join clips with light chain.
4. Place chain in bottom's mouth, pulling nipples upwards, increasing impact of both tools and bringing fragrance closer to nose, as a reminder.
9977 2018-12-17 04:21:50 Tell Quebec and BC who won’t allow for Canadian oil to flow through their territory , or help build refineries and then other territories not allowing railway passage or pipe line through their lands and then indigenous rights  and because of Ukraine we can’t get oil from Russia
9978 2018-12-17 04:21:49 @rhettmc you advertise beard oil, what is the perpose of it? I just wash mine with a 2-in-1 shampoo  is that wrong?
9979 2018-12-17 04:21:47 Tell Quebec and BC who won’t allow for Canadian oil to flow through their territory , or help build refineries and then other territories not allowing railway passage or pipe line through their lands and then indigenous rights  and because of Ukraine we can’t get oil from Russia
9980 2018-12-17 04:21:46 Dr. Bronner’s peppermint soap and peppermint essential oil in the shower is great when you’re sick.
9981 2018-12-17 04:21:45 Tell Quebec and BC who won’t allow for Canadian oil to flow through their territory , or help build refineries and then other territories not allowing railway passage or pipe line through their lands and then indigenous rights  and because of Ukraine we can’t get oil from Russia
9982 2018-12-17 04:21:38 If only your outrage was as significant for the real reason for the protest instead of providing fodder for Trudeau sympathizers to condescend those with real concerns about the future of our oil and gas industry.
9983 2018-12-17 04:21:31 Well, I’ve often thought that if Quebec can hold referenda on leaving Canada, why not let the rest of Canada vote on whether they want Quebec to stay on present terms where they receive about $12B in transfer payments&refuse to allow wealth generators such as oil sands to export.
9984 2018-12-17 04:21:31 You’re delusional. And the Oilers were named after the Oil Kings. As in the wealthy Oil barons. And it’s possible to be pro-pipeline and be Liberal eh? You’re so brainwashed that you think everything is black and white. You mention all these fake talking points and zero facts.
9985 2018-12-17 04:21:22 Sadly the U.S. Gov knows that CBD OIL is a cancer cure, and thats why they placed a patent on it, and want to keep it federally banned, so the big pharma can milk us dry.
Their are alot of people who beat cancer with just CBD OIL.
I Hope your wife gets better.
9986 2018-12-17 04:21:08 Cuci bersih kot tonyoh pakai baby oil ahhahaha
9987 2018-12-17 04:20:51 Lol they will own part of our wheat board, they are a huge portion of our oil. Wtf? Who do you expect the deal to hurt? All it will do is put Ontarians out of work and a tense international situation worse. Ffs, this idiot and his virtue signals kills jobs.
9988 2018-12-17 04:20:50 scalp naturally produces oil so if u havent washed in a while itll always get greasy eventually! if its Super greasy u might wanna look into a different shampoo (possibly like a cowash?) that doesnt strip ur hair as much
9989 2018-12-17 04:20:45 Took two ativan, now I’m nauseous. So ima be sitting here hitting this cbd oil hoping I don’t die
9990 2018-12-17 04:20:38 From Oz “oil can what?”
9991 2018-12-17 04:20:28 My wife is reading the NIH gov website and it apparently has a reference to rape seed oil.  That’s a bad typo
9992 2018-12-17 04:20:12 I want someone in the film industry to post a thread of all the little tricks and stuff they do on stage with the set and while acting. Sorta like the video about ads tricking us with motor oil and shaving cream
9993 2018-12-17 04:20:06 ドラム式洗濯機…
9994 2018-12-17 04:20:05 Customers at my job expect me to know everything and anything to do with cannabis. A lady asked me today if she can write off her CBD oil as a medical expense. Bish, do I look like yo accountant?
9995 2018-12-17 04:19:58 Do it please, and stop importing oil as well please, and no business with Saudi no more please. As a Saudi I tell you that we don’t need you and neither do you. If this deal stop we will have our money back and more on top of it.
9996 2018-12-17 04:19:48 Substitute with CBD oil orally or vaping. I’ve smoked for 10 years. When I introduced CBD to my daily routine, my weed intake almost flatlined. Clear headed, most of the benefits, legal in 50 states.
9997 2018-12-17 04:19:34 I’m definitely going to try the Hempz whipping cream  and the face oil
9998 2018-12-17 04:19:30 So far I've BBQ'd spuds as oil & paprika covered wedges, and sliced in foil parcels with onions, garlic and butter. Baked is boring. Any other BBQ spud ideas?
9999 2018-12-17 04:19:27 If people buy it will see it . Let’s not underestimate the evil of the elite . They will start wars to defend their precious oil
10000 2018-12-17 04:19:26 That doesn't achieve objective. We need access to a deepwater port in Saint John NB in order to pursue European clients.

The Middle East & West Africa oil producing nations are 1 revolt away from tearing down their ability to produce. Only thing preventing it is brutal dictators
