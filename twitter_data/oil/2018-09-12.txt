46 2018-09-12 23:55:45 Trump is an idiot! How much money are you paying at the pump? The price of a gallon of gasoline continues to increase even though the world is a washed in oil! The price of gasoline will continue to increase as the demand for oil & other petroleum products continues to decrease!
47 2018-09-12 23:55:42 Try Oil ofOregano but get the tablets/gels. The liquid is deadly!
48 2018-09-12 23:55:38 Idk?  I think Obama drove oil prices down hoping it would be a good issue to run on.
49 2018-09-12 23:55:12 Does that mean our oil prices are going down?

78 2018-09-12 23:51:10 Don't forget the economists who told us oil would hit $200 per barrel and that we would have to get used to permanently high prices - just before the price crashed due to the unseen global slow down.

83 2018-09-12 23:50:47 Standard Oil and AT&T build massive infrastructure that enormously benefited American society. Facebook built a lame website that steals our personal data and sucks our productivity at home & work.

The Govt smashed those first two monopolies. What should it do to Facebook?

85 2018-09-12 23:50:38 The CIA has admitted to funding ISIS. The wars in the middle east are based on lies by the US such as weapons of mass destruction. We all know that you are planning to overthrow the assad regime so that you can control the middle east and its oil.
86 2018-09-12 23:50:33 Guess you didn't read the whole article. It said: "....the other reason President Obama doesn’t spend more time beating the drum on this crude oil production surge is that it is readily apparent that it happened despite his administration, and not because of it."
87 2018-09-12 23:50:27 Kick backs kick back kick backs...   you are nothing but a paid Energy ( ie oil and gas) industry lap dog who’s gotten away with it because your constituents don’t bother to actually care what you do every year
88 2018-09-12 23:50:03 They say marriages are made in heaven. Agni gives you access to Akash. Marriage is not in human hands to create a conducive atmosphere to touch the Divine, light an oil lamp.
89 2018-09-12 23:49:47 Rolling back regulations are so those who run oil, coal, & fracking can roll in $ and ruin the environment. Trump only gave tax breaks to the wealthy & corporate. These are FACTS, researchable. Republicans have NEVER been for working class or middle class.
90 2018-09-12 23:49:46 I think my kid knows how he’s making me feel today because i walk out from the bathroom and he’s dumping my stress away oil in the diffuser 
91 2018-09-12 23:49:37 That actually makes sense. The oil industry does often contribute to conservatice think tanks. i.e. TPUSA

95 2018-09-12 23:49:17 And when "next year's housing crash" occurs, everyone (including me) will say we predicted it and wonder why no one listened!

Housing "crashes" tend in geographic pockets and post the mining, oil and gas boom have hit regional Australia hard. Next year's may be more wide spread.
96 2018-09-12 23:49:16 Her name was Dil but I read it as Oil. And I said it with complete confidence
97 2018-09-12 23:49:04 You misspelled “sell” and left out the term snake oil
98 2018-09-12 23:49:00  vet said she’s fine. Does have arthritis but if needed later will go on arthritis meds.  She did say to keep giving her consequin and to start fish oil pills. She was on the fish oil a few yrs ago. But we stopped because of the consequin.  She’s starting back on fish oil now

100 2018-09-12 23:48:37 Actually it was republicans in power who invaded Kuwait and Iraq as I recall, both times by the Bush 41 and 43 presidents for the exact same reason for the oil industry Halliburton owned in part by Cheney and big factor in pushing these wars still ongoing-when Obama was elected
101 2018-09-12 23:48:34 There are lot of economic factors behind it amd rising petrol prices. Trade war between US and China, sanctions on Iran, US applying tarrifs, monopoly of oil bloc etc. Govt can hardly do anything here. Maintaining artificial strong ₹ might be one option but that will deplete..
102 2018-09-12 23:48:25 The last time we all sold out was "scientific research" , this time its " subsistence"....same lies, same results...USA,Japan, Norway, Russia kill whales. Why ? Perfume ? No. Oil ? No. Food ? No. sport ? yes.

105 2018-09-12 23:47:48 Baby oil - noted.
106 2018-09-12 23:47:45 Lol. That's not science genius, but nice straw man to a deflection maneuver.  I know people who work at the epa, he's assigned two anti science oil lobbyists back to back to sand bag real science. Canadian, huh. Well stupidity has no borders I guess.
107 2018-09-12 23:47:38 “It’s raining. You wrote that tweet. Nice job making it rain with your tweet.” We really haven’t advanced very far as a species in that regard. The veneer is a bit flashier, but underneath we’re still highly susceptible to shamans and snake oil salesmen.

109 2018-09-12 23:47:24 I tried to be all natural by diffusing a shit ton of peppermint essential oil while I study for a big exam but it ended up just making my apartment reek of Junior Mints 
110 2018-09-12 23:47:06 Wow, since POTUS has:
Increased my take-home pay
Substantially lowered unemployment 
Lowered my taxes,
made the USA the number one oil producing Nation since the early seventies brought companies back to the US & unshuttered factories and coal mines. That's my kind of stupid.
111 2018-09-12 23:46:41 I wonder how much less our debt would be if we didn’t have to pay to clean up abandoned oil and gas wells. Another subsidy to the most heavily subsidized industry in the world. But it’s all good someone made their million or two, the taxpayer can pay to clean it up.

116 2018-09-12 23:46:22 Oil still flows to Damascus and has always flown towards Damascus, even during ISIS occupation. Btw it’s more like 11 million since the rest fled.

Normally I'd do the work myself for cheap but its hard to change your oil in a parking lot
Although maybe I should try that next time

148 2018-09-12 23:41:31 -Appy toothpaste and leave overnight

-Spot treat with Tea Tree oil 

-Apply witch hazel 

-Apply Apple cider vinegar (ACV) 

-ice your pimple before bed (if you do this in the morning it irritates it and makes it redder)
149 2018-09-12 23:41:22 I know this guy, fights against fracking and the oil industry destroying the land, poisoning the water, and even causing earthquakes. He'll go on and on about how government failed to protect people. VOTES REPUBLICAN! aaaaarrrrggghhh!
150 2018-09-12 23:41:21 Pro tip: Alt coins are not diversification. You want to cross industries that do not correlate with or influence each other. Examples: Tech manufacturing & oil, pharmaceuticals & commodities, food production & real estate trusts, etc.
151 2018-09-12 23:41:15 Picked this baby up on Quintessa. Nice folks, the Quintessons. Give you a good deal and... mh.. aaall the oil you can drink.
152 2018-09-12 23:41:01 It should be used for space travel because if venuazela got more money for their oil. And other more deeper stuff.
153 2018-09-12 23:41:01 #MAGA Now elect a conservative Gov in Pa. and lets build on our natural gas and oil resources. Instead of letting cabinet man raise taxes on EVERYTHING.

157 2018-09-12 23:40:31 That is liberal math to make any kind of a claim that we should not get our oil to tidewater.  You are fine with Canada getting 50% value for oil piped to the US?
158 2018-09-12 23:40:30 Jason Kenney would have turned the taps off and used every means possible to move this infastructure forward . The NDP do not support oil industry neither does the Liberals and that is why we are in this predicament .
159 2018-09-12 23:40:28 I had a great time getting my oil changed today? The oil change guys and I went to the room underneath and I saw the bottom of my car which I've never seen like that before.

164 2018-09-12 23:39:37 I recently discovered that International delight coffee creamer has palm oil in it. I’d prefer to not buy items with palm oil in them. Any suggestions for hazelnut creamer that isn’t ID. Thanks
165 2018-09-12 23:39:29 You must be hiding something. No pit dweller could be so content.... You must have struck oil? Oil! And you're hiding it!! Give it up or this means WAR!!
166 2018-09-12 23:39:20 New evidence?!  Most of the issues were predicted and red flagged years ago.

It was snake oil to begin with. No new discovery that
167 2018-09-12 23:39:20 Jim, you are LOVED as you  are.   Walk with John. I cannot not offer you what John can.  He is a man as are you.  Who carried Jesus’ cross? A man. Who washed his feet with their tears, comforted him and anointed him with oil?  I am a sister, a mother.  I need your strength.
168 2018-09-12 23:39:16 #nyyankees #yankees  Severino asked in pre-game if he made any mechanical changes before start.  “ yea I put in new alternator.  Changed oil.  Rotated tires. New air filter. I thinks that’s it”   @TMKSonYES

174 2018-09-12 23:37:32 I have read quite a bit and I am not so stupid as to be brainwashed. I was questioning the methodology in my very first tweet. I don't object to weed for adults at all and I am very interested in CBD oil without the psychoactive portion of the drug.
175 2018-09-12 23:36:59 I know Amreica has become dumbed down, but ur more than dumbed down pal, ur oil pan has been completely drained! Stop revving ur engine b4 it blows. I'd tell ya 2 stop doing what ur doing 2 your brain but, I don't believe there is much hope that a dolt like urself can be helped!
176 2018-09-12 23:36:43 If you retweet stupid and ignorant republicans/conservatives, you should bathe in hot cooking oil

181 2018-09-12 23:35:31 @hoomie24 3/4 cup yellow corn meal,  1 1/4 cup all purpose flour, 1/4 cup sugar,  2 tsp baking powder, 1 cup of milk, 1 beaten egg,  1/4 cup vegetable oil or bacon grease drippings. Blend dry items first and then add wet. 400 degrees until golden.
182 2018-09-12 23:35:20 I really want a @Tesla  mr @elonmusk but it’s still out of the price range monthly, any chance there is a model 2 in the works around 24k? Tired of paying for gas and oil changes, I have a long daily commute.
183 2018-09-12 23:35:10 And how long were we unofficially the world’s number one producer of oil? Also, if that’s the case can we reduce the price a bit? We aren’t blind and we aren’t stupid either. I’m tired of you claiming stuff you didn’t do.
184 2018-09-12 23:35:06 Beard oil is not for your beard, it comes from inhumane beard farms, don’t support the inhumanity
185 2018-09-12 23:34:27 There is a chemist in cork near me that's sells CBD gold oil I just needed info about it as I've never tried it before and hope won't interfere with other medications.but I won't know till I try it and hope it works.need a life back now

They take many, many years to escape & so accumulate. Oil companies release conspiracy theories to protect profits
193 2018-09-12 23:33:26 While opening my amazon package I had the realization that I am practically a middle aged woman. I got aloe infused fuzzy socks, a candle, pjs, makeup cleansing oil, and a microwaveable shoulder wrap that smells like lavender.

198 2018-09-12 23:32:48 Remember when we had a Scottish Stock Exchange?
Remember when we discovered Scottish Oil? 
Remember just after that, when England ordered the closing of our Stock Exchange so all of our new oil business would be transferred to their London Stock Exchange.

225 2018-09-12 23:29:51 What? EPA was notified about theother chemicals and did not ask for more specific information and it is the fault of the oil and gas companies no the EPA or the manufacturer? My question is how did you know about the chemical?

228 2018-09-12 23:29:21 You will want to ingest the CBD oil to get internal pain relief. Baths are wonderful for sore muscles, but endo is really intense. I would suggest an extra strength oral tincture. I hope you feel better soon!!

237 2018-09-12 23:28:14 That's what people say but yes if you have the right amount of water it won't stick. You should oil it after its cooked or put your sauce on right away but nah only salt in the water

242 2018-09-12 23:27:56 Prices of crude oil drop, prices of petrol or diesel still go up. Something has to be done and ain’t the government but ya the people should just one day stop all our cars on the street as a protest

249 2018-09-12 23:26:26 How do our job numbers compare now at 70$ a barrel oil to the last time oil was at 70$. Heres a hint its not good. Unemployment rate in Calgary is sky high and oil is 70$ a barrel that is just not good enough. The NDP have done all they can do and need to step aside.
250 2018-09-12 23:26:24 As a hydro carbon exporter we need our own currency to deal with fluctuating oil prices. We can't be linked to rUK currency, an importer, it just wouldn't work.

283 2018-09-12 23:22:57 @LEXXXLIEEE bby girl next time your oil pops like that just throw some salt on it, and wahhlaaa no more popping 
284 2018-09-12 23:22:55 During my nap today I dreamt it was night and multiple Saturns were falling to the ground as if being sent down an oil funnel and exploding, then the rest of the sky followed in enormous balls of fire. The noise in the air was eerie and unidentifiable. 1/2
285 2018-09-12 23:22:43 My favorite essential oil is bacon grease.
286 2018-09-12 23:21:59 The U.S. is now the world's biggest oil producer. The U.S. is ahead of Saudi Arabia and Russia. It’s officially now the world's biggest oil producer for the first time in more than four decades. Wow!!!! Thank you @realDonaldTrump
287 2018-09-12 23:21:54 I think Dave if the spend is 5.4 Billion, which it will not be (will be much higher), that money could be used as investment to draw in industry outside of typically oil and gas related dependencies in this province.
288 2018-09-12 23:21:51 I accuse Colonel Sesame oil of committing the crime in the in the 2nd playroom with the wrench!

291 2018-09-12 23:21:32 Label the oil as “Milk” and the gas as “Organic”. That will get us a premium over current price.

Stand up for science.

296 2018-09-12 23:20:47 @DianeKochilas Will you please recommend a great Greek olive oil? I don't mind paying a price but I hate being duped.
297 2018-09-12 23:20:25 Gee, just like big oil companies, only smaller, eh what?
298 2018-09-12 23:20:11 dude is building the most disgusting sandwich ive ever seen:

299 2018-09-12 23:20:10 Skincare twitter: my oil cleanser is being discontinued (or, at least, i couldn’t find it at my Walgreens). Tell me your favorites, props if they’re under $15, must be able to deal with waterproof mascara.
300 2018-09-12 23:19:58 Coconut oil, sweat, and evil.
301 2018-09-12 23:19:52 Is the deregulation worth our environment? It’s ok for the oil companies to release methane gas in the air. The coal mining to release the byproduct in our rivers use asbestos in more products the tax scam helped corporations but we have to pay the deficit
302 2018-09-12 23:19:39 Making rice without any oil is a goddamn travesty... lo siento
303 2018-09-12 23:19:34 Katrina, Sandy worst storm in NYC in  years, Harvey worst storm in Texas history,  Maria, typhoons and tidal waves in Asia, unprecedented heat waves this summer but the GOP so hungry for oil money they deny science not caring how many will die in 5,10,50 years.

306 2018-09-12 23:18:47 I sunk an oil tanker off the shores of Galillee.
307 2018-09-12 23:18:31 You're playing with words while the planet cooks. The OECD calculated NZ fossil-fuel support at $78 million in 2016. Another independent estimate suggested it's $88 million in subsidies for production and consumption of oil products.

312 2018-09-12 23:17:56 #tonightvmt I don’t like People constantly citing Venezuela as Proof of Failed Socialism. It is far more a Victim of the ‘Oil Curse’ where Huge earnings from $100+ Barrels of Oil mean all other Products in their Economy become uncompetitive as Exchange Rate keeps going up & up
313 2018-09-12 23:17:37 Regardless of what ball I may be getting tomorrow from the league I won (if they arrive tomorrow), I'm still ordering a new one for heavy oil. Probably the Katana Dragon or the Quantum Bias. Leaning more towards the latter.
314 2018-09-12 23:17:25 If snake oil is such a scam, then why was it outlawed?
315 2018-09-12 23:17:18 I tended to use an orange essential oil (sometimes blood orange or tangerine) but lavender was also nice with the basil.
316 2018-09-12 23:17:05 True, it’s time to switch to olive oil
317 2018-09-12 23:16:49 Has nothing to do with who was/is president. Horizontal drilling, fracking & a whole lot of engineering & study & money by drilling companies. The deregulation under Trump has helped a bunch. Hard work & long hours & lots of sacrifice by many families. Proud to be an oil family.
318 2018-09-12 23:16:46 You really think Big Oil don't control people's access to information? That's the whole point of Fox News.  And you must not live in the South where I see confederate flags (and Trump stickers) everywhere.
319 2018-09-12 23:16:28 おはよう！
320 2018-09-12 23:16:22 HOW IRONIC THIS WOULD BE.

I am no economist but looking back at charts seem like the best GDP growth years for Obama were during High Oil prices and all the Fracking going on.

Is it possible that a Fossil Fuel help save Obama's GDP numbers
321 2018-09-12 23:16:15 I swear I spend $1k on my car every time I take it for an oil change. Which fucking depletes any money I have saved up and always maxes out what I've paid off on credit cards.
322 2018-09-12 23:16:11 Example: one could nationalize the oil companies, or nationalize natural resources such as oil (or both)—while also issuing low interest businesses loans expressly for launching coops, making the coop structure more competitive. Both can coexist.
323 2018-09-12 23:16:05 それはあるよな、、

328 2018-09-12 23:15:54 The fed has done little to control the libor rate. Money is still cheap. As for OPEC, when was the last time Saudi Arabia was a force in the economy?
Trumps aggression against gulf states is causing the mad gyrations in oil prices heading back up to $80/barrel, just like Bush.

334 2018-09-12 23:14:34 Olive oil is that bitch
335 2018-09-12 23:14:27   US is NOW the world's largest oil producer - For the first time since  1973, the United States is the world's largest producer of crude oil,  according to preliminary estimates published on Wednesday by the Energy  Department.
336 2018-09-12 23:14:05 Gonna make muffins but I have no eggs so I'll just use extra vegetable oil
337 2018-09-12 23:13:52 PS, I nearly missed it in the instructions but you have to oil it “twice” with the little oil spout/container they give you.
338 2018-09-12 23:13:38 Ancient treasures & secrets! Add in some peril, or a great deal of it,  and it is the stuff of great adventures! I'm still holding out for some of the lost manuscripts from the Library of Alexandria, or say, a car that doesn't leak oil! :)
339 2018-09-12 23:13:36 I got told the oil on your fingers would wreck them even if you are gentle.

346 2018-09-12 23:11:54 Read the McCrone report re oil.  Your answer which is a question to my question suggests you have no answer.

349 2018-09-12 23:11:30 @toe_masito In that same Forbes article you cited:
“..it is readily apparent that it happened despite his administration, and not because of it. President Obama coincidentally happened to enter office just as the shale oil boom in the U.S. was getting started.” & he cut imports.
350 2018-09-12 23:11:28 I’ll be glad when we aren’t so dependent on oil
351 2018-09-12 23:11:20 #America , Good Great Oil Crude Producer In the World , Thank U The Realy President In The World Mr. @realDonaldTrump , I Hope Go forward And  Success U and Your Country  .

353 2018-09-12 23:11:13 The past 8+ years of muckin' and grindin' in the oil and gas industry might just pay off in a way I would've never imagined.
354 2018-09-12 23:10:53 Actually, you're right Robert, they have nowhere else to house that ridiculous monstrosity so we can think of any figure and charge them accordingly. Very similar (as you say) to our oil revenue and our guestimated GERS.. 
355 2018-09-12 23:10:36 You cannot exactly wage war on a hurricane.

You could try and harness it's vast natural energy but the US prefers oil.

357 2018-09-12 23:10:33 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
358 2018-09-12 23:10:33 In 2040 Europe, Britain, America and most of Asia would end dependent on fossil fuel (oil). We need to start diversification drive today by building local businesses.

366 2018-09-12 23:09:34 If the US is now the worlds largest oil producer....then gas should be $1 a gallon!
367 2018-09-12 23:09:12 So much for Peak Oil.  These Globalist are losing there grip.

370 2018-09-12 23:08:45 im not sure. i usually always have a bottle of lavender oil in my inventory, never used it for spiders though, they don't come in my room often, too messy lol
371 2018-09-12 23:08:37 the snake oil salesman will make everything better!
372 2018-09-12 23:08:29 I suppose we can attempt to do a better job at holding that day off for great grandkids. Don't you? Peak Oil is a thing. The Earth does not have an infinite supply of oil so we may as well start transitioning easy and slow before the panic hits when its actually gone
373 2018-09-12 23:08:23 Crude oil production is good, but you need refineries to process the crude into gas and there have not been any new refineries built in the US since the 70's. The refineries we have struggle to keep up with the demand for gas we use now. Gas prices drop with new refineries.
374 2018-09-12 23:08:22 Burn it, stick all the ashes in an empty oil can, and throw it in an alligator infested river. Anyone crazy enough to go in there for some ashes, is crazy. But not as crazy as this reply ahaha. I watched too much criminal minds.
375 2018-09-12 23:08:19 Again, this will be credited to Trump. We know the Dems were never interested in the US oil mkt. So, I'll argue  besides Jeb, Rand, any one of the other GOP primary candidates would have us much farther along in the economy than the liar n chief Trump.
376 2018-09-12 23:08:16 They used the classic French melty cheeses in the video and I think i would too. Not much oil or clumps when melted, and a stronger taste than when they’re solid.
377 2018-09-12 23:08:04 Money back and a whole year of free oil changes... I would’ve fucking rang their necks.

421 2018-09-12 23:03:34 So you're admitting the U.S is protecting ISIS? The dollar is tied to the petro agreement, when they finally attack Iran, the strait of Hormuz will be closed, oil prices will skyrocket, and the dollar will fall. The end of the U.S economy. Good job you Zionist Shill.

423 2018-09-12 23:03:21 Does bio oil actually help with getting rid of scars?
424 2018-09-12 23:03:16 Absolutely. Crunchy over everything, but foh with that store bought shit. You gotta get hit with a few stray oil bullets in order to achieve taco perfection
425 2018-09-12 23:02:53 Does this mean you will be asking your suppliers to name on their #packaging the specific type(s) of vegetable oil/fat used (& especially #PalmOil)?  If so, that would be a positive step for #transparency and informing consumers.
426 2018-09-12 23:02:50 Lol, I was only kidding about your state... But looking at things, Nigeria is seriously leaving over dependence on oil behind, but we need a visionary leader to get us better and private sector participating actively.

432 2018-09-12 23:02:12 Carter established a bipartisan stance that the United States would forcibly defend its oil interests in the Middle East. He drove it home in the messaging of a State of the Union speech. Creating a public, bipartisan policy that helped usher in the forever wars is p significant.

495 2018-09-12 22:54:57 We've seen a 45% reduction in GHG emissions from buildings, largely driven by switching from oil and coal electric generation to gas and renewables. We need a switch in transportation, from personal cars to e-bikes and public transit to get similar results.

500 2018-09-12 22:54:39 It’s staggering people just overlook the fact oil money took over, saved Chelsea and made City. Financially man united could/can always spend top market price. Arsenal tried to compete on a shoe string budget and on some occasions did so.
501 2018-09-12 22:54:31 I guess you can get away with murdering seaturtles and dumping oil in the ocean so long as you are a rep in the fishing industry giving away free shit to the “conservationist stewarts.”

555 2018-09-12 22:49:09 Brent tiptoeing around 80 crossing and diving back down.  It will very soon find a nest above 80.  Saudi’s disappointing US on production sent Perry out to beg Russians.  Me thinks Trump will quiet his tweets on oil for awhile.
556 2018-09-12 22:49:08 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
557 2018-09-12 22:49:04 Only by accelerating on the road to energy self sufficiency, India can hold on in the Oil market .We have the Sun,Wind,Sea ,Rivers but not enough action ...
558 2018-09-12 22:48:46 Do you use oil products?  Don't tell me you are a hypocrite?
559 2018-09-12 22:48:43 We also grow the food, pump the oil, and manufacture all their modern conveniences.

We can basically with the fight by all taking a couple days off of work.
560 2018-09-12 22:48:38 Put Wesson oil on it
561 2018-09-12 22:48:36 I love my smell, yung pinaghalong amoy ng salonpas and essential oil. Amoy matanda. Lavet. Hahaha 
562 2018-09-12 22:48:36 FG no longer mentions oil price.
563 2018-09-12 22:48:32 Don’t tell me Oil Spills are good for the environment. Those would never happen without humans

565 2018-09-12 22:48:02 I don't think you're in any position to speak Crypto. To think you're an oil painting shows how delusional you are!
566 2018-09-12 22:48:02 Actually, I have Pruitt becoming an oil consultant as slightly more predictable than him becoming a coal consultant

569 2018-09-12 22:47:54 my car fix  gone give her a oil change and all tomorrow
570 2018-09-12 22:47:48 .@WholeFoods homeopathy has no evidence supporting it, and loads showing it doesn't work. As a MAJOR retail player, by stocking it, you legitimize this snake oil and delegitimize the other therapeautic and medicinal products you sell.

Please stop.
571 2018-09-12 22:47:31 And their leakage hurts communities much more than it hurt the businesses collecting this data (oil). 
However, the amount of data in tremendously increasing so we might soon have a Bro’s taxonomy of data like in types of crude.
572 2018-09-12 22:47:18 I love the people complaining about the new iPhone prices while I’m sitting here single with no kids with ain’t shit to spend my money on but the XS max and some hash oil. I love my life.
573 2018-09-12 22:47:18 Methane production from cows (or even humans) is a negligible source at best. One of our biggest sources comes from the production of oil and gas. Did you know that 90% of natural gas is methane?

579 2018-09-12 22:45:52 Tonight's fresh catch is umami glazed Atlantic Ocean Salmon, grilled to perfection and served over aromatic jasmine rice with a tropical citrus salsa and finished with cilantro infused oil!

Our daily soup is roasted garlic and wild mushroom. We hope to see everyone in!

Thank You President Trump for working to bring back American Exceptionalism!

585 2018-09-12 22:44:52 Tell the REAL story!!  Exporting our oil increases the pump price for consumers.  Win/win for your energy industry owners, lose/lose for your constituents!  We know where your priorities are!!  #tfumpsucker

592 2018-09-12 22:44:00 Hi there.

593 2018-09-12 22:43:51 Welp either way reading through it I love it, it's really well written~
594 2018-09-12 22:43:49 That's why I never did vibrant colors in my hair.  The bleach would be too much.  Otherwise, I'd totally go for an oil slick rainbow dye job.
595 2018-09-12 22:43:35 To get crude oil, one has to dig deep and when it's gotten, I think we all know the tonnes of goodies in it.
596 2018-09-12 22:43:27 Holding it till Florence passes.  Worried it'll get covered in Wesson Oil....
597 2018-09-12 22:43:26 I think they hate tea tree oil. I have started pouring it everywhere since I moved to the wrong side of the Atlantic (aka the side where windows don't have screens)!
598 2018-09-12 22:43:16 Hi
599 2018-09-12 22:42:58 I am putting a quilt down on the middle bathroom floor and pillows for my animals and I......have always had tornadoes during hurricanes to that is my middle of house room no windows
600 2018-09-12 22:42:46 none of this would have been happening without that snake oil salesman starting all of it spying and lying obummer
601 2018-09-12 22:42:44 Got 20 mins? Try Pictsweet Farm roasting veggies! My family loves them! Just add some olive oil, salt, and pepper and roast away!  #gotitFree #PictsweetFarms #LetsRoast #RoastEmUp
602 2018-09-12 22:42:35 Bring some cooking oil in a cup
603 2018-09-12 22:42:25 Americans would rather get oil from Venezuela and Saudi Arabia.  19 out of 20 9/11 hijackers concur.
604 2018-09-12 22:41:56 Main headline in tomorrows FT. 

"Oil prices near four-year high as hurricane heads to US"
605 2018-09-12 22:41:53 And the fact we’re there illegally occupying Syrian land. Assad has every right to liberate every inch of Syria, from U.S., terrorists & the kurds. This proves WH, Pentagon, State dept. could care less about lives of troops. Just sacrificial pawns to their oil grabbing agenda.
606 2018-09-12 22:41:51 The guy that’s doing my oil change literally just asked me what key to put in the ignition........... he high af
607 2018-09-12 22:41:48 우정이라는 기계에 잘 정제된 예의라는 기름을 바르는 것은 현명하다.
It is wise to apply the oil of refined politeness to the mechanisms of friendship.
608 2018-09-12 22:41:43 the world's richest are arabes.religious fools,they sell the oil to the rich.
609 2018-09-12 22:41:28 Isn’t protection and conservation of US oil a matter of national security?  The conservativeposition should be to save our oil.
610 2018-09-12 22:41:21 Wait until a week or two! It’s amazing the difference. When ppl would say coconut oil this or that, I was like yeah, okay. It actually does work. I hate anything in my lips- EXCEPT coconut oil. 
611 2018-09-12 22:41:13 Gone ahead i need me a oil change soon

621 2018-09-12 22:40:03 Which oil do you use for your beard abeg?
622 2018-09-12 22:39:47 Changed the oil in my car and put in a new battery 
623 2018-09-12 22:39:45 Cramer: The surge in oil prices could reverse the oil-and-gas bear market ...
624 2018-09-12 22:39:45 So you are banning import of non carbon neutral products through Washington ports?  Seems fair since you won’t allow a coal or oil exporting terminal to be built.
625 2018-09-12 22:39:34 I think the olive oil is overkill but the rest seems quite balanced...
626 2018-09-12 22:39:07 Let me give a good advice dear Nikki. Go and see a doctor gal. Your non stop bulliyng against Venezuela is too sick. Anybody with brain can read it in your non stop twits about it. You are wasting your time. Everyone knows that the USA is after the Venezuela's WORLD OIL RESERVE.
627 2018-09-12 22:38:28 I would say mind your fingers because of hot oil/hot baking tray. But other than that I enjoyed making it. :)
628 2018-09-12 22:38:27 Blow some ma way bud can't sleep lol then again don't smoke stopped it 9 years ago cos I had small throut cancer ie smoking kills hash cures ie oil

630 2018-09-12 22:38:18 Just make sure you're not allergic. I add 3-5 drops of pure essential  eucalyptus oil into the bath
631 2018-09-12 22:38:04 More Snake Oil from the Snake Oil President. Executive Order should have been written on Charmin. Then it could be used for something. Once again Trump signs meaningless Executive Order. This actually protects Putin and his trolls. Why won’t Trump call out Russia and Putin?#TFA
632 2018-09-12 22:37:46 Just witnessed an aftermath of a car accident. Both cars absolutely destroyed, a lamp on the floor, 3 firetrucks on the scene, covering oil and blood on the floor...I couldn't breathe for those 15 seconds. Never seen anything as bad as that  Please please drive safely people 
633 2018-09-12 22:37:44 You're playing with words while the planet cooks. The OECD calculated NZ fossil-fuel support at $78 million in 2016. Another independent estimate suggested it's $88 million in subsidies for production and consumption of oil products.
634 2018-09-12 22:37:42 Wait! We should support this! Our congress critters would step over their dead grandmothers to suck on big oil’s teat!
635 2018-09-12 22:37:28 donr blame messgnr....but probably on tap...one side will prevail....69.70s or 70.68s.....oil

currently flat....12-18s indx has gped up so it seems on chart...
636 2018-09-12 22:37:26 Don't get me wrong - I think @DNVGL's report nails many details of the #energytransition, including the decline in primary demand. However, in terms of the mid-term future for oil & gas I see their assessment as almost econometric & out of touch with climate realities.
637 2018-09-12 22:37:22 bro why i offered to make eggs & bacon for my roommates the other day & one of them tells me, while she’s eating it, that she doesnt eat pork because of her religion. sis  you’re so lucky i didnt fry the eggs with the oil from the bacon  i would have felt so bad.

639 2018-09-12 22:37:15 Tips on a natural way to cure a headache? Tried tyneol and it does nothing for me. I’ve had a cold all week and the headaches are rotten. I do have essential oils for all my oil lovers out there 
640 2018-09-12 22:37:13 You're playing with words while the planet cooks. The OECD calculated NZ fossil-fuel support at $78 million in 2016. Another independent estimate suggested it's $88 million in subsidies for production and consumption of oil products.

644 2018-09-12 22:36:39 Minneapolis: Greg Russ is a snake, and he's selling you snake oil. It's, like, oil he harvested from his own snake body. It's gross and you shouldn't buy it.
645 2018-09-12 22:36:35 Salt and a little bit of oil, 10 mins 180 in the oven.
646 2018-09-12 22:36:27 I listened to this truly frightening woman. I fear for the wars to come and our young ones who must sacrifice to make sure the oil continues to flow in the direction our government wants!
647 2018-09-12 22:36:20 Good Nite pal
I’ll dm you some sheep to count.

648 2018-09-12 22:36:17 4.2% growth , lowest unemployment ever for all groups . Companies and manufacturing jobs 600,000 moving back to America. Largest oil exports ever . High consumer and business confidence, foreign countries paying for NAFTA, redoing weak trade deals . Could be here all day .
649 2018-09-12 22:36:09 Ah, yes, it’s worked out very well for Venezuela who probably had the best headstart for success when they nationalized their oil industry.
650 2018-09-12 22:36:09 Won’t need another oil change until March of next year so that’s cool
651 2018-09-12 22:36:05 Had a great meeting today in SA...a company has invented a new way to extract crude oil from plastics at a very high efficiency and produce super low sulfur fuels.  The process is called Pyrolisis.  China has banned all plastic imports globally which means more plastics are
652 2018-09-12 22:35:53 Says the V.PEDO pres "hope" ful. Yo Joe, sit on one of your son's stollen Ukrainian Oil Rigs.

654 2018-09-12 22:35:38 So he can take the oil! We already know that story.
655 2018-09-12 22:35:36 I'm a SW developer, so what I was doing was not oil industry specific. Just quarterly they would tell us how the company was doing, (not well), and why, (oil too cheap to drill). Second time I ended up in the oil and gas industry, for some odd coincidence.
656 2018-09-12 22:35:34 What ya sick?
657 2018-09-12 22:35:23 I hope in the NEW NAFTA the proportionality clause that makes Canada sell oil and resources to the US even if Canada is suffering shortage will still be there.  I want to rape Canada like a Miss Universe contestant.  Thanks to the Canadian Conservative Party for your support.
658 2018-09-12 22:35:11 You said it yourself, they're GOING to do a lot of things, just like snake oil products. And maybe I'm not understanding Walton correctly, but it seems to be an inventory system for businesses using block chain and rfid. Don't see how that is better than a central app
659 2018-09-12 22:34:55 DAMN, SHE SAID SHE WAS ON, MORNING & EVENING MEDS...sister, sister, i beg of thee, research the oil of black seed; healing!!!

661 2018-09-12 22:34:39 Big yes from me. A safety net to sort out all the oil/petrol spilling, smoke chugging vehicles on the road in daily use in Guernsey.
662 2018-09-12 22:34:39 Maybe DuPont will try to claim us all as their territory now, like BP with every bit of Gulf of Mexico shore that their Macondo well oil touched
663 2018-09-12 22:34:20 Drizzle the oil. It can get greasy fast.

673 2018-09-12 22:33:25 theory, small business and small minded and investment management and still Christina's testimony in front of the mock Singapore Medical Board is really something that all the Chevron Oil Black engineers need to know to present "more hijacked" shows still as one black student put
674 2018-09-12 22:33:14 Mostly in it for the story. Musk is the next Jobs. Tesla is the next Apple. It is saving the world from pesky oil fueled vehicles. It drives SO well. Tesla doesn’t need a capital raise because they will be FCF positive in Q3..
675 2018-09-12 22:32:45 JESUS IS COMMING SOON ! People get ready! Anytime now, let Him find you with your oil lamp full!
676 2018-09-12 22:32:45 Anyways, it depends. If it burns a little oil, or leaks a couple drops, who gives a shit. Just add more. If it’s consuming quarts, thats a problem.

683 2018-09-12 22:32:03 Well burning comes from leaking. But leaking means external oil, puddles in the ground etc. burning means leaking into combustion. Blue smoke etc.

686 2018-09-12 22:31:42 The consumption of oil did not create the hurricane.
687 2018-09-12 22:31:23 Of course - UAE is part of the war in Yemen - US - France & UK - Germany,  turn a blind eye to Saudi Arabia. The oil.
688 2018-09-12 22:31:23 I want to try something like Canticle for Leibowitz or Crowley's Engine Summer, 800 years after the apoc with the descendants of the Oil Apoc group. I like when peep forget what old tech is about and build on its bones.

698 2018-09-12 22:30:06 Another article pushing misinformation.   THC is needed for the majority of conditions.  This is just advertising CBD.. and says that THC is removed from cannabis oil and so you cannot get high... this is not true. Call it by its name.. its CBD oil.. NOT Cannabis oil.

705 2018-09-12 22:29:14 From what I can tell, there's no magic ingredient to volumizing shampoos, it's just the absence of anything that would leave oil or residue on your hair which would weigh it down.

711 2018-09-12 22:28:43 I over came stage 3 cancer with black seed oil. Black seed oil was found in King Tut's tomb. It was thought to be more valuable then gold.

713 2018-09-12 22:28:30 What?

I hoped and prayed for a miracle of healing but instead my lamps stayed lit for week on one day's oil. Which was doubly weird since they were electric!

Then I prayed for a  miracle of loaves, and two bears showed up and ate the gang bangers in my neighborhood!

Why?
714 2018-09-12 22:28:26 titus spilled my entire bottle of essential oil on his hands and I almost peed my pants laughing
715 2018-09-12 22:28:24 OH man that's tough. Will take a minute to come up with a complete ranking but I'd say any pasta tossed in a simple oil dressing (rather than a tomato sauce) will probably be easiest and make for the best leftovers (tomato sauce can lose its texture when microwaved next day)

718 2018-09-12 22:27:46 Olive oil is just something I read online to be fair  I prob shouldnt be so trusting of the internet
719 2018-09-12 22:27:28 I’ve been so busy I just looked up and realized I’m 4000 miles overdue for an oil change. 
Four. 
THOUSAND. 
720 2018-09-12 22:27:00 awww cute I had  pink hair at one time, just some of it oh and purple lol
721 2018-09-12 22:27:00 Thanks, I was noting that homes don't use oil in NZ, i.e. solar panels won't displace oil.
722 2018-09-12 22:26:46 @kfc no wonder why @PopeyesChicken n @ChurchsChicken is beating you guys! Your chicken peices are skimpy AF!! You might as well hand out baby chick's not to mention your breading sucks and ain't crispy it's full of oil! Step up your game!
723 2018-09-12 22:26:39 The Quebec election is now in full swing. Promises so far. Free transit, free daycare, guaranteed basic income, free medication, no more poverty, no gas-powered vehicles by 2035, no oil, free education, a “glutton” tax, tax on internet purchases, free internet........
724 2018-09-12 22:26:34 I have no problem with it. I just think your side likes to overblow nonsense.  He is supposedly a racist Nazi traitor BUT this remark means he deserves impeachment.  Maybe he doesn’t have his oil changed every 3000 miles? If so, he really deserves impeachment, then. #KeepDigging
725 2018-09-12 22:26:23 I doubt it, right now I'm looking at the same photo in their official website and I can see the same watercolor/oil painting effect. My expectations were a bit too high I guess

727 2018-09-12 22:26:12 Let’s break them all up , this should’ve been done years ago .. government did it in oil , gas , railways, to name a few   When companies have this much advantage over the market , they have to be broken up .

731 2018-09-12 22:25:51 if that 70 breaks, then back to 67/68.  hurricane slowing down and should send oil lower.  plenty of oil out there as saudis and russia can supply the market.

733 2018-09-12 22:25:46 Still sci-fi. Taking one character from first series and spinning off. Intend to keep it still kid-friendly, but without younger protagonist won’t be YA. How about you now that Oil Apocalypse done?
734 2018-09-12 22:25:45 I need to look at engineering gigs at the oil companies in TX.

737 2018-09-12 22:25:15 I'm going to try bar w/o oil after I row tonight. It isn't a volumizer like the aussome I usually use but I like how my hair looks and feels with it. You should tell Cas what you need/want in shampoo or soap and try her out.

740 2018-09-12 22:25:01 And that's the least offensive thing he does.  Destroying ACA, environmental protection, opening up national parks for mining and oil drilling, removing endangered species protection, the list goes on...
741 2018-09-12 22:24:58 Yeah it isn’t doing it for me either, but I’ll let ye know if the almond oil does the trick
742 2018-09-12 22:24:52 Hannity is a hoax. Fracking is a non profit, subsidized by the govt just like the oil industry in general...look at the dive its stock is taking bc investors want profit (fracking)
743 2018-09-12 22:24:48 I just came by to say good night, still getting things done for the hurricane, I am so scared
744 2018-09-12 22:24:37 He's been wearing the same baseball cap for the past 2 years. It's way past due for an oil change.
745 2018-09-12 22:24:33 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.

748 2018-09-12 22:24:20 btw re: Cas' soap/shampoo bar:

I usually have to fight oil in my hair. I found her soap bar made my hair feel different and fought back the oil better. I used hair oil after and that was a more aggressive conditioner that didn't seem to make the hair oil up as quickly
749 2018-09-12 22:23:59 For after the storm those with damp houses to keep mold and mildew forming  England deals with damp homes all the time  Lemon oil, tea oil  put in spray bottle prevents fungus till you can deal with damage. It will be months before repairs done

751 2018-09-12 22:23:52 Fossil fuels are sold to the highest bidder on the international market. American Oil is not just for American consumption.
752 2018-09-12 22:23:44 Should be spending my money on an oil change going to get dinner with my brother instead 
753 2018-09-12 22:23:44 Shit Nate, don't you think maybe we've been experiencing an IPO crisis for about two-decades?  What qualifies as a crisis?  It's not a technical term.  However, the Great Recession began in December 2007 w/ $135 oil.  It's related...  And it's also related to the financial crisis
754 2018-09-12 22:23:40 Wanted to fry them but to lazy to go get some oil 
755 2018-09-12 22:23:31 Yeah we should have zoning like Houston— chemical plant next store to a day care center and oil rigs next  to grade schools

765 2018-09-12 22:21:57 I’m sorry, Can you tell this whole oil thing is a problem for me? I just keep thinking that America is smarter & more inventive than this. Plus, I’m old enough to remember when gasoline was 25 cents a gallon. We were big dreamers, then. Everything was possible.& to you!
766 2018-09-12 22:21:54 I've avoided it so far.  It hasn't done bad for itself considering it started out as a small fishing village before oil money changed it completely.
767 2018-09-12 22:21:51 Lolol baby oil and TRT.
768 2018-09-12 22:21:49 BC produced oil, other than what gets used at Husky PG goes to AB, then possibly back to Parkland refinery in BBY. Refined products sent up coast to AK/YT/NWT. Who decided to shut down BC refineries? How vulnerable is the BC market to outside manipulation?

770 2018-09-12 22:21:41 Again, I’m all for clean energy. Not sure how you don’t get that, I’m not for big oil or burning fossil fuels etc etc . But I’m also not for letting a completely corrupted government agency selling me crisis propaganda, telling me I need to pay more taxes so they can solve it
771 2018-09-12 22:21:12 The winners in oil (if the world doesn't end) will be international E&Ps with Brent exposure. What are all the hedge funds investing in? US & Canadian LTO producers. I'm starting to see cracks in the dam that relate to the resource rolling over not the bad business model #Popcorn

778 2018-09-12 22:20:04 Does it burn oil or leak oil. How much? And which motor does it have?
779 2018-09-12 22:20:00 Hi, Laura. We're sorry to hear you're having an issue w/ the oil leaking on your CR-V. We'd be happy to confirm if there are any campaigns, including safety recalls or updates, issued on your Honda. Can you DM us your VIN & mileage? Has your dealer inspected your car? ^FC

781 2018-09-12 22:19:49 So, Ted, how is the solar energy industry in your state doing?  You know, the one you traitorous @GOP have tried to wreck...the one the oil Big Boys want to see controlled?
782 2018-09-12 22:19:48 This was a great and important podcast. I was curious, though, how Musk squares his distaste for finite resources such as coal and oil with his own 100% dependence on lithium, another finite resource.
783 2018-09-12 22:19:48 I wonder if a carbon tax was levied on those coats as well. After all, the sewing machines used would require electricity and oil to keep the machines running. Maybe they did a gender survey on the coats as well to ensure they meet the gender requirement....
784 2018-09-12 22:19:32 I wonder how difficult it would be to bring back whale oil?

794 2018-09-12 22:18:07 Yes, along as you allow 2-3 for serum to absorb first. You can also apply a sheer layer of moisturizer between serum and oil. Always massaging in between steps. Face oil should be part of your nighttime routine though.
795 2018-09-12 22:17:57 Did I say a branch? I’m saying your prices are going through the roof. You are owned by people who can get cheaper oil. Let’s see it down to £1.10
796 2018-09-12 22:17:56 "I know people". A few years ago you could have called and I would have picked up the phone at work and said, "How can we, a super large company in the oil services industry, assist you in oil and gas extraction?"

798 2018-09-12 22:17:34 It is nice to see some acknowledgement of the importance of the U.S. oil and gas industry to national security.
Also nice for those of us in the industry to hear it. Made my day. 
And it came from my very own Congressman.
Thanks Steve!!!

803 2018-09-12 22:17:15 Robert Francis O’Rourke aka BETO says wants to end Fracking strange coming from a Texan especially since TX is leader in Fracking & TX Oil economy is booming.

807 2018-09-12 22:16:58 Sure. It's all about the electrification of transport. Displacing oil used in vehicles with electricity. Transpower forecasts a significant increase in electricity demand in response to transport electrification. More clean energy is needed.

810 2018-09-12 22:16:26 Yep, that is exactly how I do my skeletons on my Knights. I then go with an oil wash, which you can find on a separate video.
811 2018-09-12 22:16:01 Direct question: is the #HondaClarity maintenance minder oil change alert based on (oil-lubricated) combustion engine revolutions, or main axle revolutions? I'm told it's the latter, which makes zero sense. Happy to use @Honda service, but they need good info on #PHEV tech.
812 2018-09-12 22:15:42 So, I am trying to understand accurately the impact of hurricanes on the price of oil. Last year hurricanes drove the price of crude oil down. This year the price is up. What gives?
813 2018-09-12 22:15:32 Last night was very good and I didn’t prep at all which is a bad habit of mine but. I improved a very good npc who was like a snake oil salesman named Patsy and they all figured it out

They beat up Patsy a bit and got the town’s money back. But Patsy framed them for stabbing him

822 2018-09-12 22:14:19 Before Putin and Abe meeting, the countries signed several business contracts. Among them, Russia’s gas producer Novatek and the Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC) signed a framework agreement.
823 2018-09-12 22:14:17 I think if it weren't for factors like wars, coups, revolutions, oil, etc, Islamic extremists would be more or less like Southern Baptists. Still objectionable, sure. And that you can blame on the Quran. But in the current situation, those factors matter.
824 2018-09-12 22:14:14 My CBD oil makes me so happy 
825 2018-09-12 22:14:13 Use chicken or vegetable stock instead of water, dice up some garlic and toss it in. Try toasting the grains in a bit of olive oil before you cook it!
826 2018-09-12 22:14:07 Plus because it’s not a solid cube it USUALLY avoids palm oil but still do check to make sure.
827 2018-09-12 22:14:00 Shapeshifters are actually extremely oily naturally, so they excrete oil no matter what form they take. It ironically makes them incredibly easy to spot

847 2018-09-12 22:11:57 What if there was no oil in the country? we might have been better off. Things would have been done right.Many things we faking now won't be. Or what if the oil was in northern Nigeria?Just thinking why we aren't growing.

If you have been served allioli mixed with mayonnaise, it has been gentrified to adapt to USA tastes. Not the real thing.

870 2018-09-12 22:08:23 I like the notion of accountability-based services. For some problems - like health- the accountability needs to go both ways because the user’s role significantly determines outcomes.

It’s like blaming the car mechanic when you refuse to use the proper fuel or change the oil.

884 2018-09-12 22:06:06 Agree. I don’t know economic lingo but the capitalist/market economy (ability to engage in business & make) that pulled half of the Chinese population out of poverty is to CCP ideology as water is to oil. They don’t mix. Xi can’t have it both ways.

929 2018-09-12 22:01:17 "The iPhone Xs..."

Yeah but it's not "excess" though is it?  It's the usual Apple snake oil pitch.  We improved the screen, processor, and memory.  We also took stuff other developers from other companies were working on, stole it and claimed innovation (their camera tricks).

932 2018-09-12 22:01:02 And. It explains why no other USPrez did it sooner. Follow the money. Oil and gas production overseas is/was very lucrative for those pols who became very wealthy from those alliances. Keeping everyday US Citizens under the thumb of foreign oil moguls was the end game.
933 2018-09-12 22:01:02 Cost of drugs in U.S is redistributive in nature. 
To each according to need and from each according to ability. U.S for many years is seen as having the ability to subsidize lesser nations since we are very rich compared.

965 2018-09-12 21:57:27 All true again, though none really relates to the issue of climate change which is all I’m talking about. Oil production contributes, yes, but not as much as consumption which the US does excel in.

967 2018-09-12 21:57:23 COME BY BMW MOTORCYCLES OF COUNTRYSIDE FOR DEALS ON REMAINING OIL AMD PARTS FOR YOUR BIKE!
968 2018-09-12 21:57:22 Dick Scott is a consistent liar as are all Republicans who are ALL flat out owned by the anti-Democracy, anti-Science Koch's who learned to hate Democracy who worked in Russia drilling oil for Stalin; he liked Stalin's policies of never helping the people, letting them starve
969 2018-09-12 21:57:19 Keto vegan absolutely floors me. How much  oil and   can a person eat?
970 2018-09-12 21:57:08 No there is a bar.
Recently laid 10 feet beneath the ground and struggling for space with oil pipelines.
971 2018-09-12 21:57:03 Make coffee (I use instant) then put in blender or use one of those soup blending sticks...add a big slice of good quality butter or coconut oil. You can use both too...whizz together, drink. It’s actually tastier than it sounds and great on a #ketodiet 
972 2018-09-12 21:56:50 Having the best Italian meal I think I have ever had @EnzosHideawayFL @WaltDisneyWorld  Perfect Smooth Red Wine, Perfect Olive Oil for our bread, and the Sauce.... Yum! But the best part? NO KIDS!!!!! 
973 2018-09-12 21:56:49 If they find oil or gold I’ll no longer call them “bad girls”... fair enough? 
974 2018-09-12 21:56:29 Something to ponder. Oil supplies are at an all time high. Demand is down. The Kochs' ICE Brent exchange pushes oil futures to almost $80 @ barrel. Can we say market manipulation? Insider trading? Dark trades?Russian conspiracy? International criminals?
975 2018-09-12 21:56:12 Yo gak seh, kata bapakku yang udah lama kerja di perusahaan oil and gas, construction, dan semacamnya itu ga ngeliat kamu cewe/ cowo kok, yang dilihat itu skill sama kerja keras kamu. Banyak kok cewe yang kerja satu proyek sama bapak, padahal di chevron, total, gtgt
976 2018-09-12 21:56:05 Morrison's speeches & press conferences are all like lisening to a "snake oil salesman".
977 2018-09-12 21:55:57 Dig the damn thing S. of the border thru Montana, Idaho and WA. Ship the oil from WA. I doubt free enterprise America would say no as long as they get a cut of the action. Dig it 1 meter away and parallel to the BC border.
978 2018-09-12 21:55:49 Brilliant John! lol, and let's not forget where oil comes from- fossils of giant lizards which never existed being poured into gas/petrol tanks! How they ever got away with that complete nonsense is beyond me.
979 2018-09-12 21:55:47 To the man at the gas station who said I should find a man to fill my tank, and put oil in my car because women are meant to stay at home. You best believe no one will ever fill my tank or put oil in my car, because I am capable. I won’t depend on a man to do something I can do.
980 2018-09-12 21:55:45 Oil stocks will crash in this weekend. Not exactly.　　石油株は今週末に暴落するだろう。いや、そうでもないよ。
981 2018-09-12 21:55:38 The internet is turning into a snake oil salesmen.

Lots of claims with little to no proof.
982 2018-09-12 21:55:34 While sitting in the waiting room at the oil change place, this lady asked me if I was studying. I told her yes and how important my exam was. She told me she would be praying for me and my exam. That made my whole day!
983 2018-09-12 21:55:23 Bakit kinikilig pa rin ako pag nagpapop yung chat head mo. Huy self stapet!
984 2018-09-12 21:55:15 Capitalism isn't a thing? That's really what you're going with? Dear, oh dear. From slavery to climate change to oil wars, extreme poverty and deaths from preventable diseses, capitalism has quite literally killed far more people than any other economic model in human history.
985 2018-09-12 21:55:14 Hi Brady, you have made a mistake in the HI podcast, the man who bought the painting was a sudi arabian prince called MBS and he bought it from the oil money not his own, he also bought the most expensive yacht and a French castle.
986 2018-09-12 21:54:58 Ok, so, I’ve been there, and I just can’t get my head around why they prescribe olive oil to anyone ever. It DOES NOT WORK!
987 2018-09-12 21:54:44 This is sad. Aioli (actually all-i-oli) is far from being mayonnaise. It is pure olive oil and cold-pressed garlic (mayo is egg and sunflower oil), and if you tried the real thing you would be amazed.
988 2018-09-12 21:54:34 Get ready, Church !!  Oil in the lamps to the brim!
989 2018-09-12 21:54:18 olive oil the oil or olive oil popeye's lover?
990 2018-09-12 21:54:14 Man I had to get my oil changed.
991 2018-09-12 21:54:05 But I’m not saying the same may apply to Xinjiang because they’re state owned company & Xinjiang oil production will always be a national security issue not a economic issue so they might not have the impetus to adapt.
992 2018-09-12 21:53:59 Huy self kumalma ka.
993 2018-09-12 21:53:50 Well to me the reason why Shale industries have to cut their total cost of production is because they’re cornered with 75% oil price tank (and they might have to readjust their balance sheet and relying more on equities because of rate hike).
994 2018-09-12 21:53:43 Drink olive oil, its good for you
995 2018-09-12 21:53:27 All oil is deadly to fish. So is raw sewage. Bitumen is no different. Try again bullshitter.
996 2018-09-12 21:53:06 Supply and demand yes.  But, talk to those damn greedy oil companies.
997 2018-09-12 21:53:02 I love my horse but my god the amount of food it takes to keep weight on him is unbelievable. Daily: 8 - 9 Pounds of grain, 8 flakes hay, 2 flakes alfalfa hay, Hemp Oil, Cool Calories and about 20 treats. DAILY.
998 2018-09-12 21:52:35 Good news! Oil was clean from the z, no metal in the engine or diff  she’s well on her way to being back on the road

1002 2018-09-12 21:52:09 @AndreaTWeather As I said, as long as big oil and their flunky (the government) are calling the shots, the plastics problem is never going away.  In over 150 years we still rely on internal combustion and jet propulsion?!  REALLY?? They won't let go of fossil fuels + derivatives.
1003 2018-09-12 21:52:04 12 SEP 5:49pm currently *NO WAIT* For oil change, alignment, diagnostic, State Inspections, vehicle, motorcycle and large drive through outside trailer inspection lane accessed from Little Creek RD or Avenue J from the rear, there is a Rental Vehicle Available at Carmasters

1005 2018-09-12 21:51:52 @craftsman sent an email but no response yet. My 1 year old 30cc 4 cycle trimmer is not starting. Changed spark plug and new gas and oil. Nothing. Hoping for assistance.
1006 2018-09-12 21:51:32 lmaaaoooooop I'm telling u about the piece

Another fun fact : the piece has a bunch of mess lil details, like it also has actual dirt on it(an oil stain) hence "as dirty as my mouth" and horse misspelled as "whore-s" and sloppy kisses at the top

1009 2018-09-12 21:51:05 Which country do you have when an Indian foreigner can do all the works of unskilled labour and has more rights in the law than you, your lake was sold that's why fishing is left for army and don't think you have oil man you are a foreigner in your motherland#FreeBobiWine
1010 2018-09-12 21:51:02 The thing is, it’s not just water in the surge. It’s everything. 

Trees, lumber, glass, cars, trucks...oil, gas, chemicals and pesticides from underground storage tanks...refrigerators, mannequins, propane tanks, power poles and sewage are a few of the things I’ve seen.
1011 2018-09-12 21:50:57 Show me a pathway to low carbon that does not cripple Big Oil&Gas.
There isn't one. This is why we are sold non-solutions and ccs
1012 2018-09-12 21:50:47 High reserves critical to hedge against ups and downs of oil market. Glad we kept a 10% reserve several years ago before oil market tanked again. Many in my caucus wanted to spend it all.
1013 2018-09-12 21:50:44 @realDonaldTrump maybe if you stop with the oil, which hurts our ozone layer which allows more water to be evaporated from the oceans thus causing storms such as this one, those people wouldn’t need to be evacuated so don’t say you care about us, we need @BarackObama
1014 2018-09-12 21:50:27 Win Nov canola down A$3.29/t & EU rape down A$9.44. Caught by rising Malaysian palm oil stocks after poor monthly exports. Weakest August data in 10 yrs. Decline despite lift in US soybns after a USDA Report. Rising A$ hasn’t helped.
1015 2018-09-12 21:50:25 I was helping my mum use some chinese oil for back pain and the smell is really strong and minty but also medicinal and its like the kinda menthol feeling where you can feel the vv good minty burn through your skin  working the magic like i could use it for my migraines & that +

1017 2018-09-12 21:50:11 I wonder how they determine the high quality of margarine? Is it because it's made from palm oil it doesn't good enough? I think it's just the choice of ingredient.
1018 2018-09-12 21:50:08 Does he support our thriving oil industry that has provided 4-5 generations of Texans a secure income, a secure retirement, and ample energy for our businesses to prosper?  HELL NO.
1019 2018-09-12 21:50:05 @JiffyLubeCares you guys are the worst, I have told everyone I know to not go there for oil changes!

1023 2018-09-12 21:49:14 Well, most ciabatta has olive oil in it, which will add to the calories. From what I can work out from recipes, it's about 10ml of oil per loaf, if it's in there.
1024 2018-09-12 21:49:13 オイルだって怒るんだぞ怒ったら引火してギトギトのボーボーにしてやるからな
1025 2018-09-12 21:49:11 why are u next to olive oil
1026 2018-09-12 21:49:02 Yes, take a look at who's sponsoring Attack Ads on 1631, (WA's initiative that puts a fee on carbon pollution & invests the $ in solutions like wind and solar.)  Big out-of-state oil companies.  Same guys that/ve misled us for decades on climate & worked against every solution.

1036 2018-09-12 21:48:05 If the hijackers were patsies, the govt would have framed Iraqi and Afghans. Why frame Saudis and then not invade Saudi Arabia.  If we were after oil, Saudi is the honey pot, and they have a weaker military than Iraq did. Plus Hussein was a check on Iranian power.
1037 2018-09-12 21:48:04 Why is it so many oil change jobs in Cleveland

1040 2018-09-12 21:47:56 I think this is done for penguins that have been compromised by oil spills, helps keep them warm. The sweaters have to be a natural fiber so that they naturally disintegrate.
1041 2018-09-12 21:47:54 needa go get my oil changed
1042 2018-09-12 21:47:32 oily hair culture is thinking you can go just 2 days without washing your hair only to find out there's a secret oil factory in your scalp the next day

1054 2018-09-12 21:45:25 As often as I can. I ordered a monthly subscription to wild caught Alaskan salmon that we will start getting next week. Right now my favorite way to have it is baked with olive oil and paprika. I also ordered it in restaurants a lot.
1055 2018-09-12 21:45:15 Same thing also apply to US shale industries with regards of leverage but personally as long as they have a track record of having more operational cash flow than current liabilities in the past decade (which include oil price tank by 75%) they’re viable investment.
1056 2018-09-12 21:44:52 Me too! Not quite the same dramatic effect as fake lashes, but I just started using castor oil at night to help my natural lashes grow and I'm shocked at how well it works. In just a couple weeks they're already fuller and longer. Definitely would recommend trying!
1057 2018-09-12 21:44:51 A bunch of recently washed laundry has dark oil stains and suddenly I can’t find my other lip balm....
1058 2018-09-12 21:44:46 Hold on, we like oil. We hate oil. 

Oh good things are going on with oil?

Must be Obama.

Even though I keep hearing people bitch about subsidies for oil companies.

At least be consistent.
1059 2018-09-12 21:44:42 Y'all my body feels like the tin man when they first found him and had to oil him to even get him to be able to move his elbow/knee/etc. I need WD-40'd

1065 2018-09-12 21:44:04 Twitter is just asking to be split up...remember Standard oil?

1067 2018-09-12 21:43:53 THANK YOU. Jesus. Living in Venezuela I'd always hear the politicians saying "and we'll stop selling oil to those Yankees!!" And I was like "how the fuck do they not understand oil is a fungible commodity? Oh, that's right, populism".
1068 2018-09-12 21:43:41 Right! Like I been peeped that’s what it was for because ever since people started raving about castor oil and coconut doing all these magical things they started gravitating toward that crowd. And the thing about it that I’ve noticed is since they’ve done it..
1069 2018-09-12 21:43:40 y you stay hatin on me fr tho? you wish you worked for me and you been using my oil since it came out

1073 2018-09-12 21:42:33 for sure going to get a oil change tomorrow
1074 2018-09-12 21:42:25 American oil,natural gas,and coal has put America back on top and will keep us there. As long as globalist like Soros,Bush,and Obama don't get us under their thumb, and dependent on their middle East cash cows. Russia's pipes through Europe, are also owned by Soros

1078 2018-09-12 21:41:42 Grasping the concept of death & the beauty of it, is like trying to catch a fish that’s swimming in oil, with your bare hands
1079 2018-09-12 21:41:15 @squidlimerick can I ask Ur followers about CBD oil the gold brand how they find it and how much they take and if it works please.thanks x

1082 2018-09-12 21:41:04 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
1083 2018-09-12 21:41:04 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1084 2018-09-12 21:41:04 Jacob: Why are you naked and covered in oil?

Troye: You know how you always say I never glisten-

Jacob: Listen. You never listen.

Troye: Oh.
1085 2018-09-12 21:41:00 Some of it is the lighting and the age of the oils, but different colors also come from how the oil is produced, for example different additives are added for different uses. These oils were motor oils.
1086 2018-09-12 21:40:59 Keeping, oil,gas,and coal companies from working,keeps the United States in a hole. And that is what liberals like Obama wanted. Depending on other countries. I worked a drilling business for 45 years,barely excised during the Obama term...went to-full swing when Trump took over.
1087 2018-09-12 21:40:57 Remember when skully spilled cooking oil all over the floor and it never really went away
1088 2018-09-12 21:40:53 Don’t burn the midnight oil at both ends
1089 2018-09-12 21:40:44 Sometimes it sucks to have a car especially when its time to pay for oil changes, tires, and tune ups
1090 2018-09-12 21:40:43 I drink coffee everyday, workout everyday, take prenatals and fish oil everyday and never once had a doctor told me against any of that. It’s all how your own body handles it

1092 2018-09-12 21:40:40 I always get nervous taking my car to get checked out bc I'm sure the techs just look at each other and go
"that's a messy car"
"does she live in her car"
"she's gonna need an oil change. and then some."
"why does she have so many clothes in her car"
"fuck"
1093 2018-09-12 21:40:39 I never really had particularly dry or oily skin but now that I'm on T you could easily substitute frying oil with my face

1098 2018-09-12 21:40:10 pause. not to butt in but what kind of face oil.
1099 2018-09-12 21:40:09 全ての油という油に感謝しているよ。
1100 2018-09-12 21:40:07 On a tangent, did you see the article about the Chinese “swimming pool” reactors for district heating?  I’d love to run the numbers on using those for district heating in NYC.  We still use so much fuel oil!

1102 2018-09-12 21:40:02 Oil and water :)
1103 2018-09-12 21:39:48 Oil is fungible world wide, so it's world demand vs. world supply that determines the local price.
1104 2018-09-12 21:39:46 For skin two words sis - emu oil
1105 2018-09-12 21:39:32 but... oLIVE oil makes them live again....

1107 2018-09-12 21:39:30 I swear, the essential oil diffuser is not mine.  I'm just storing it for a friend.
1108 2018-09-12 21:39:09 I would like to add Johnson's Baby Oil to the list of things my skin can't handle.
1109 2018-09-12 21:39:09 And you on Saudia Arabia and every countries you invaded in the last century. Because that's what created the world of today.
The US destroyed Afghanistan to stop the communism. Destroyed Iran because of oil. Destroyed Irak because of Bush and his fake bomb of mass destruction
1110 2018-09-12 21:39:00 If you were right every oil company would be valued at zero. If fiduciaries obeyed every whim of every interest group there would be little left to buy. And no one with a track record to manage the residual assets.
1111 2018-09-12 21:38:44 pores, hyperpigmentation, excess oil
1112 2018-09-12 21:38:41 Without the oil boom

1116 2018-09-12 21:38:14 Wow. Damn Keys it's always something. Try the coconut oil. It couldn't hurt right? Well not as much as the shit that is already hurting on your body.
1117 2018-09-12 21:38:02 How is it fair that chronically unwell people still have to have periods? I’m honestly dying and I’m still waiting for an investigation for endometriosis so my whole day has been spent sleeping. I’m trying CBD oil infused bath now too. I’m so desperate for some relief
1118 2018-09-12 21:37:52 You guys are still selling Motor Oil because of Mark.... Glad to see the relationship continue.

1120 2018-09-12 21:37:34 Trump/Zinke trophy hunting mentality won't be satisfied until every living creature is destroyed. All to make room for fracking, oil..Don't any GOP care about our one n only planet?
1121 2018-09-12 21:37:22 I think you should save the oil for a New event
1122 2018-09-12 21:37:10 Bio oil overdose...lol!
1123 2018-09-12 21:37:03 Still a fight for oil then
1124 2018-09-12 21:36:49 which church was the pastor that gave anointing oil from?
1125 2018-09-12 21:36:41 Fuel needs oil 
oil is a globally traded commodity priced in $ per barrel 
£ is down against the $ (and 120 of 130 global currencies) 

The fact you’ve been unaware of these facts suggests it’s pretty original  
1126 2018-09-12 21:36:29 That’s good. All the more for the  Oil Fund.....
1127 2018-09-12 21:36:24 You should absolutely think of the Alberta NDP when you think of an economy like Venezuela's - doomed because of its dependence on oil.

1132 2018-09-12 21:35:52 We all have a few oddball delights, and if these were outliers in this book, it would not be so remarkable. But the rarities here are the dishes that are fully from scratch. Instead, one finds "Homemade Doughnuts" that use purchased dinner rolls fried in 1/2 inch of oil
1133 2018-09-12 21:35:45 Hey I’ve got CBD oil 
1134 2018-09-12 21:35:32 So you telling me I’ve sat with a greasy coconut oil head for hours before for nothing.
1135 2018-09-12 21:35:28 Yes, dice them up, toss in olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Roast at 400 degrees for 30-45 min depending on how big your diced potatoes are.
1136 2018-09-12 21:35:15 People are still living in fools paradise. Iran is isolated from world but somehow surviving due to oil. What will we do? One month strict sanctions aur humaray awaam aur SC ko terrorist organization aur genuine charity organization main farq karna aa jae ga.
1137 2018-09-12 21:35:11 The UN backs Assad? Mate, you’ve lost the plot. Well and truly. The UN nation states as a VAST majority hate Assad & Syria for that matter, so much that they’ve wanted the country in ruins & failed. This is their last attempt to secure political change & oil.
1138 2018-09-12 21:35:10 RT @LivingSafely: Mountain Dew this September? The drink contains Brominated Vegetable Oil, a substance banned in Europe and Japan.
1139 2018-09-12 21:34:58 E.g You can mix extra virgin olive oil with coconut oil and use it for your hair
1140 2018-09-12 21:34:56 STORYTIME

My dad used to have this pump shampoo from suave, and I used it too cause we were tight on money.

That shit literally did not clean my hair, it left more oil in it than anything

and I've hated suave products ever since.
1141 2018-09-12 21:34:44 #Brent #oil at its highest level today in 1388 days
1142 2018-09-12 21:34:34 why are you near olive oil...
1143 2018-09-12 21:34:25 America is now the largest global crude oil producer – surpassing Russia and Saudi Arabia

Thanks to @realDonaldTrump deregulated economy we no longer need fascist dictatorships to fuel our economy

This is massive and the media is silent
1144 2018-09-12 21:34:01 did you really leave us for 15 minutes and then come back and tweet olive oil and then leave again? smooth sabrina, real smooth
1145 2018-09-12 21:33:50 だから地球寒いって言ってるでしょ！！！！！
1146 2018-09-12 21:33:46 Think you’ll find it’s world oil prices that determine pump prices. Come up with something original
1147 2018-09-12 21:33:41 It's never going to change as long as big oil is calling the shots since plastics are derived from carbon chains.
It's also hard to believe that in over 150 years we can't conceive a better mode of transportation than internal combustion or jet propulsion; space program and all!
1148 2018-09-12 21:33:31 Cairo hasn’t been sleeping with his bonnet now he has a bald spot  i need to buy him some coconut oil
1149 2018-09-12 21:33:24 I think we may have actually been debating The Jets vs The Flames, for which the answer is obvious.  Or we could have been talking about delivery vs payment of oil contracts using central bank settlement.  Conversation flipped between both.  :). #Cordacon2018
1150 2018-09-12 21:33:19 Tuna straight out of the can, and recently, after decades of struggling every time to get this material down my gullet my little brain coughed up the idea of drizzling it with olive oil and life has never been better
1151 2018-09-12 21:32:53 thank you for your input! I have been looking for a good oil for such hijinx myself. Why not ask the best? 
1152 2018-09-12 21:32:52 just used vitamin e night oil. face has never felt so soft.
1153 2018-09-12 21:32:45 Yeah? That ermine-gland oil in the front desk.
1154 2018-09-12 21:32:44 I need my nails , toes and eyebrows done. And I need an oil change .
1155 2018-09-12 21:32:43 How many of them before the oil money? They were playing in front of 10k and cars parked behind the goal not so long ago.
1156 2018-09-12 21:32:35 Hey CBD Oil Geek thanks for the follow!
1157 2018-09-12 21:32:03 Got my coconut oil and i cant wait to start oil pulling!
1158 2018-09-12 21:32:03 What are the levels compared to 2014 when they last started to play down the oil/gas production? I'll lay money on it being higher.
1159 2018-09-12 21:32:00 I hope he got his oil changed and tires rotated as long as he was in the shop.
1160 2018-09-12 21:31:55 I’m going to start taking the bus I’m tired of gas and oil changes and tires and car washes...
1161 2018-09-12 21:31:48 Diane’s hobby is to kill a whole oil pen in 5 hours & then ask if anyone else feels tired
1162 2018-09-12 21:31:38 Yes! PR was my home(Humacao). School in Bayamon. Dad a mngr at Yabucoa Sun Oil. This incredible island treated us as family. I am disgusted by these remarks. NOT an A+ or a success. Pathetic & disgraceful. This gringa will stand up for my beloved PR all the time!
1163 2018-09-12 21:31:35 Nah, she's right, if the current administration has their way with the environment, all the waves will be murky brown or crimson, and smell of crude oil, dead fish, sewage, and red pigmented flagellates.
1164 2018-09-12 21:31:31 The truth is Putin/Russia and CNP/NRA/GOP/Seminar Network Donors/libertarian billionaires/Big Oil/Big tech are all on the same team. The events surrounding Brexit, Catalonia, Ukrainian & Georgian elections, US Presidential Elections for 2000, 2004 & 2016 are all related.

1166 2018-09-12 21:31:21 We used coconut oil in this scene. Which is good for everything
1167 2018-09-12 21:31:02 It's like one of those little white Vick's inhaler things but with peppermint oil instead of Vick's. It's very calming.

This natural bar is creamy, full of lather, and fragranced with cozy notes of cherrywood, raspberry, vanilla and tobacco.  
It's wonderful for moisturizing and is gentle for every skin type.
1176 2018-09-12 21:29:55 if I may, what do you use for oil? Is there a kind that's your fave?
1177 2018-09-12 21:29:54 "So...do you like oil?"
"That's a stupid fucking question."
"Yeah yeah, I know..."
1178 2018-09-12 21:29:46 It is time to break up the giant media conglomerates. 
They are dampening free speech and the free flow of information.
Break them up like Standard Oil,

1183 2018-09-12 21:29:06 i be paying for convenience someone tell me why i paid 123.88$ for an oil change????
1184 2018-09-12 21:29:05 Eucalyptus oil behind the ears
1185 2018-09-12 21:29:03 Just Necron Compound. Go suuuuper light, then give it a Nuln Oil shade. If you want more definition, repeat the same steps and you'll get nice deep layers.

1188 2018-09-12 21:28:44 Wrong. This is a move in the wrong direction. Like coal, oil will be in long term decline.

1191 2018-09-12 21:28:34 spill the olive oil
1192 2018-09-12 21:28:34 I think I remember. Grate water yam into a paste, palm oil, plenty dried fish, Chilli, onions, and some other basics. Then there's a way you make the paste form small balls. But please check with her still.
1193 2018-09-12 21:28:31 Not just fracking, shale sands and other deposits. e.g. Texas basin shale sands are 1/4 the size of Texas and there are many more in Canada, Europe, Russia.
Discovery of these deposits are why the price of oil collapsed 2 years ago, and why the US became energy self sufficient.

1215 2018-09-12 21:26:03 Where r u at where olive oil is beside u
1216 2018-09-12 21:25:38 Wow what a disaster. Not for Scotland as we get sweet FA from the paltry oil revenues that flow into the Treasury. An independent Scotland will manage oil revenues in a different way to the current mismanagement by HMGov.
1217 2018-09-12 21:25:34 Nah, it's just low information people writing.  We control the weather.

1224 2018-09-12 21:24:17 I do want to say that today, in West Virginia I watched an oil truck swerve to avoid hitting a turtle that was crossing the road.
1225 2018-09-12 21:24:02 Question is what did #GEJ & @OfficialPDPNig did with funds generated when oil price was still high & was reserves near empty during handover to #Pmb ?
1226 2018-09-12 21:24:02 Isn’t that the oil income that is distributed to the population? Like shareholders.

1232 2018-09-12 21:23:34 I’ll get the baby oil
1233 2018-09-12 21:23:31 Yeah, it's beyond silly that we always get this label of secret warriors for the oil industry. Maybe we should ask the children who mine the resources for lithium-ion batteries how they feel about making the world a better place
1234 2018-09-12 21:23:05 @TheFive  if you think battery power, solar etc are cleaner. Go walk thru a battery manufacturing plant better yet go walk thru a recycling center. It’s as bad a nuclear waste. In reality coal and oil are cleaner. When you pundits (libtards ) want to make a point. Work fora livin

1240 2018-09-12 21:22:19 In plain language: Secy Zinke is selling off public lands that other Presidents set aside for wildlife SANCTUARY.
He's been selling them to oil companies. Every day.
1241 2018-09-12 21:22:12 My boyfriend's answer when I ask him why he watches so many disgusting videos on YouTube (like a guy eating 256 raw eggs or drinking 5 litres of oil): "THEY RECOMMEND IT TO ME"
1242 2018-09-12 21:21:47 I thought the shading on my tattoo was oil and was scratching tf out it 
1243 2018-09-12 21:21:45 Iya. Aku juga mau ganti ke yg oil based. Tapi mahal bgt. Thanks yaa.
1244 2018-09-12 21:21:43 Nobody demands to turn the clock back to the mid-ages and walk barefoot. But e.g. it would be a very good start to invest more money in researches for better technologies to replace our addiction to oil and coal than to turn the clock back and restore coal mining.
1245 2018-09-12 21:21:35 Then why frame 19 Saudis as the attackers. You could just have easily picked 19 Afghan and Iraqi passports to frame.  Saudi Arabia has more more oil than Iraq, and a weaker military. If it was for oil why not take Saudi Arabia after framing them.
1246 2018-09-12 21:21:34 If the west is able to remove Assad in Syria, they will go after Iran. What Americans fail to realize, is the dollar is tide to the Petrol Agreement with OPEC. If Iran is attack the strait of Hormuz will be closed, oil prices will skyrocket and the dollar will crash.
1247 2018-09-12 21:21:23 If you notice in the oil painting there is much less contrast in the background in order not to distract from the higher contrasting foreground. The cartoonist gave the woman a blonde ponytail outlined in black - very high contrast. I teach art at the college level.

1249 2018-09-12 21:21:09 The recession was all Bush’s fault and the recovery is all due to Obama. Classic snake oil salesman logic.
1250 2018-09-12 21:21:07 Please stop expecting Rick and trumpsters to engage in any concept based on complex theories. They see only 49 states & no territories until they can sink an oil well there.
1251 2018-09-12 21:20:54 The Italian language is so wonderful. Pasta, women, and olive oil and calcio. I love Milano where fashion is here to stay and I like Italy in general.
1252 2018-09-12 21:20:54 i’ve actually heard that apple cider vinegar does good things, never thought to try it for period pains!!! literally get the cramps from hell since i came off the pill over a year ago, i take evening primrose oil and that helps a lil but not as much as i’d likethanku angel!!
1253 2018-09-12 21:20:50 "Couldn't vacuum pet hair," reads the comments section in my car service receipt.

It's okay, pal. I expected an oil change, not a miracle.
1254 2018-09-12 21:20:48 oil executive: how do we sell petroleum derivatives to hurricanes?
1255 2018-09-12 21:20:38 Have you tried cbd oil?
1256 2018-09-12 21:20:33 I got an oil change, got new brakes and tires all within 2 weeks and my Car has the AUDACITY to light up the check engine light

1258 2018-09-12 21:20:15 จะโกรธอะไรดี. คืองงอะ
1259 2018-09-12 21:20:06 Worth the wait. Anything to get out from under grips of oil companies.
1260 2018-09-12 21:20:01 ugh same i just ordered a bottle of CBD oil for ruca that was $40 USD i hate me
1261 2018-09-12 21:19:45 Bella was the same a few weeks ago! I gave her Tylenol at night and organic teething oil!
1262 2018-09-12 21:19:31 We once did when they were Western facing and pro-Israel. But Saudi Arabia has the oil and is pretty influential in OPEC, so gotta stay on their good side, lest another oil price embargo is unleashed. But that shouldn't be a issue soon, iirc US should oil independent soon again
1263 2018-09-12 21:19:10 EPIC grape juice olive oil victorias secret perfume i love josh but 20 dollars is godtier herny....

1265 2018-09-12 21:18:59 You probably didn't hit send on that tweet Keys I definitely would have seen it. But not I have never heard of consuming coconut oil. How are you trying to consume it? Drinking it?
1266 2018-09-12 21:18:58 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?

1269 2018-09-12 21:18:51 Yes 2 of them drink a bit of my fruit blend which consists of mostly spinach, a whole bananna, couple prices of pineapple, with almond milk drizzled with flaxseed oil & chia seeds which I make every morning in my nutrabullet
1270 2018-09-12 21:18:43 He would have been better suited as the dictator of an oil state like Libya where the people got oil revenues but in exchange had to keep their mouths’ shut. It’s called a rentier state and we are not a rentier state. ever.
1271 2018-09-12 21:18:41 Just got a free oil change at AA Auto Care!
1272 2018-09-12 21:18:41 You're allowed to make your own edibles so that's an option. You can make medicated coconut oil and make topical salves.  Tinctures.The possibilities are endless. I recommend full plant extraction as cannabis uses an entourage effect meaning its parts work best when used together
1273 2018-09-12 21:18:40 Revolving door. This is how it works. What's Rex Tillerson doing? Oil consulting? No surprise.
1274 2018-09-12 21:18:39 Lev6:21  In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baken, thou shalt bring it in: and the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt thou offer for a sweet savour unto the LORD.  #BibleVerse
1275 2018-09-12 21:18:36 Solar has improved its cost position relative to all extraction based energy sources by hundreds or thousands of times since 1970.

1276 2018-09-12 21:18:24 Thank you Donald Trump! Good times for Nigerian Oil.

A barrel now goes for $80
1277 2018-09-12 21:18:24 Petroleum fucking stinksgas, oil, whatever.
1278 2018-09-12 21:18:21 That’s actually my next stop and I do buy Pro Plan!  A few drops of CBD oil took the edge off of a normally horrible experience!
1279 2018-09-12 21:18:17 How does he want to finance it? To borrow more or to use our dwindling oil revenue to pay salaries?
1280 2018-09-12 21:18:16 “Yeah but this is healthy because these are turkey dogs and I fried them in vegetable oil”  

Crazy that people still think stuff like this, man
1281 2018-09-12 21:18:12 I'm sure you have one oil well to your name that's why you don't need a job
1282 2018-09-12 21:18:07 Thank you Jesus for Donald Trump People just don’t understand what Obama did to the oil industry and the towns that they supported 
1283 2018-09-12 21:18:04 Not if #SAA kills them.  

If France is actually afraid of them coming there, why doesnt @EmmanuelMacron help SAA or put a French policy in place to find & kill the terrorists if they flee to France? 

His excuse is a lie. He’s a globalist who wants regime change, Syrian oil.
1284 2018-09-12 21:17:46 I read that as motor oil at a glance and got very scared
1285 2018-09-12 21:17:45 Thanks to daddy's "initiatives", my water bill is going down $3, but my oil payments went up $50. My township can't find a place to take our recycling "at any affordable price". I'm on a fixed income; YOU, missy, are in the echo chamber.
1286 2018-09-12 21:17:35 he once said he would have kept the oil. So not sure he is just being buffeted in the winds of the deep state.
1287 2018-09-12 21:17:28 Girls will be girls!  Called my daughter who has left Hampton Roads and is in Northern Virginia now seeking shelter from the hurricane.  I asked what are they doing while they wait for the hurricane to hit.  “Mom we are conditioning our hair with hot oil treatments!”  My girl.

1294 2018-09-12 21:16:29 Lol... The funniest justification a bhakt gave was that UPA also increased fuel prices. Arrey bhai, if the UPA was pathetic and corrupt and cared two hoots about the people, that does not give u a license to increase oil prices...
These bhakts I tell you...
1295 2018-09-12 21:16:27 So I’ve become such an old lady lately, I’ve been making my own soup, making my own oil burners and cleaning like there’s no tomorrow.... and ya know what? I love it

1300 2018-09-12 21:16:05 @JesseBWatters Barack Obama has been criticized for continuing to play golf while oil spills into the Gulf of Mexico.He has played at least seven times since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20, creating America’s biggest environmental disaster.
1301 2018-09-12 21:16:03 i think that was quickest ive ever gotten my oil changed
1302 2018-09-12 21:15:49 I have been trying bulletproof coffee with intermittent fasting: having coffee with butter/Mct oil at 730 and then not eating any protein or carbs until 1 pm.  It’s a “cheating” fast but I guess because you are consuming only fat your metabolism does not kick in as much.
1303 2018-09-12 21:15:45 @greggutfeld Barack Obama has been criticized for continuing to play golf while oil spills into the Gulf of Mexico.He has played at least seven times since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20, creating America’s biggest environmental disaster.
1304 2018-09-12 21:15:42 Not to mention it’s shitty fuel that you can’t leave in your seasonal equipment (snowblowers etc) without it gumming up the works. Big corn (yeah it’s funny) is not much better than big oil unfortunately.
1305 2018-09-12 21:15:37 Only of you go with the French variant. The original Mediterranean version is just garlic and olive oil. So... ya know.... that's not nothing?

1308 2018-09-12 21:15:20 71-72, I remember oil tankers lined up at Cape Henry to unload their oil, while none at gas stations, they just sat there. We were assigned odd/even days by license tags to purchase gas. I bought a “preferred customer card” to get around that. But, could fill tank for $10. – bij 400sq Feet Of Fury!
1309 2018-09-12 21:14:50 If oil rigger's can prevent an astroid from hitting earth then they sure as shit should be able to turn a cat 4 before it crosses the 0-barrier mark
1310 2018-09-12 21:14:36 It’s good.  Car has less issues than gasoline and no quarterly maintenance needed like oil change etc.
1311 2018-09-12 21:14:23 Iss like you are very experienced in this very matter. Ibidunni, have you been dousing your face with anointing oil?
1312 2018-09-12 21:14:08 Partly to cover up $2.3Trillion missing from the Pentagon and partly to go to war. War is big business for the Rothschilds. Bin Laden was in Afghanistan not SA. Opium is in Afganistan. Oil is in Iraq. All about greed.
The truth about 9/11 will be coming out soon.
1313 2018-09-12 21:13:53 My mom uses CBD oil for her arthritis. Seeing her in pain kills me and now she's not going to have that. The government and drug companies aren't benefiting off of it, so that's why we don't have it anymore lmao. She doesn't get high off of it. I'm just.. Disgusted.

1316 2018-09-12 21:13:05 Guy at expo “do you have any experience in the oil and gas industry?” Yeah man in my spare time I build drilling equipment that costs millions of dollars while taking classes and working all to get a $20 an hour internship with you.
1317 2018-09-12 21:13:02 Yesterday I went in for an oil change and turns out both my fog lights were out, one of my brake lights were out, and my rear struts were cracked. So I’m driving my moms car to cnm and I applied for a parking permit and as I went in to go get it, I got a ticket for not having it

1349 2018-09-12 21:09:43 When we were delendent on foreign oil I’ll wager you said we shouldn’t have been. Now that we’re not, complaint is not enough green energy. Great goal when the world isn’t on fire. Let’s straighten things out then handicap ourselves when we’re ahead. Check that national debt.
1350 2018-09-12 21:09:42 I have combo. Oil cleansing sounds silly, but it’s good for getting make up and dirt off. Use gauze and not a cotton pad. Hydro boost is good. Not too oily. Just light and clean.

I'm feel touch deprived, yet most of the time, feel uncomfortable with people touching me.
The best way to describe it, is that it feels like there's a layer of oil where someone's touched me, which is really uncomfortable.

1387 2018-09-12 21:04:31 Sure. and by publicly declaring that we are pivoting from Coal, Gas, & Oil to renewables. De-regulating methane emissions sends the wrong message!
1388 2018-09-12 21:04:26 TBH - less oil investment in AB is good - it makes the workforce recruiting more competitive across all industries, instead of one industry acting like a black hole that sucks up most of the talent.

1402 2018-09-12 21:03:23 just took 15 paces out of my Criminology 441 class right into the botanical garden’s gazebo. Directly next to the waterfall and koi pond, where i sat on the bench and smoked my THC oil Juul, 80 degrees not a cloud in the sky. 

I’m living my best life bitches.
1403 2018-09-12 21:03:18 Very much so ... seeing the oil still coming up, knowing all those that lost their lives and are still below...

1410 2018-09-12 21:02:24 Your plan? Unemployed oil workers plus worker unemployed from the spin-off.
Dairy farmers going broke if no NAFTA. 
Auto sector decimated if no NAFTA. 
So I guess you are right. Unemployed people will pay less taxes. @smfehir
1411 2018-09-12 21:02:22 olive oil is just a substitute for butter! it doesn't really change the taste!
1412 2018-09-12 21:02:19 They have made poor environmental decisions that have a strong adverse impact on our state & everyone. The salmon are going away! The power of big oil.
1413 2018-09-12 21:02:17 I think you can buy a 'Butcher Block' oil that works very well.  Otherwise I would
clean off with some lemon slices then dry it off and apply a no flavour oil.

I think it's transmission oil they use tho
1419 2018-09-12 21:01:14 Is he selling our, Native American's, sacred lands again? He needs to keep his ass in the WH. Or we could open an oil change place over his mom's grave and hope there are no leaks
1420 2018-09-12 21:01:08 Water is oil for your joints.
1421 2018-09-12 21:01:08 Just realized that @TweedMainStreet changed the carrier oil in their products to mct (which is often derived from coconut to which I'm allergic) 

Luckily the allergens seem to have been removed during the refining process because I realized after I took it
1422 2018-09-12 21:00:58 Aamin...insha Allah ...thanks

1424 2018-09-12 21:00:55 I must have missed him standing on the floor of the Senate calling for Pruitt to be oustered after the obviousness of his greed and partnership with Big Oil was made clear.
1425 2018-09-12 21:00:53 Does anyone else think all of @thebodycoach recipes just taste like coconut or am i just using too much coconut oil?? 
1426 2018-09-12 21:00:46 The United States likely surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia to become the world’s largest crude oil producer earlier this year, based on preliminary estimates in EIA’s Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) - Energy Information Administration

1441 2018-09-12 20:59:40 I have smeared a bit of Volcanic Elixir Polynesian Beauty Oil on my face and it's given me a lovely paedo sheen.
1442 2018-09-12 20:59:32 we need to have a march on this it's important that our public lands are saved for the next generation and not oil and gas by the greedy mongers that are in office now
1443 2018-09-12 20:59:19 we are about to publish a book on the oil and gas sector in Nigeria. which we expect all stakeholders to be part of the book. we are focusing on the host communities.
1444 2018-09-12 20:59:19 I don't know this for sure, but it sure makes sense in hindsight. Gore is a RU asset with longstanding ties to Armand Hammer's oil corp. Gore inherited Hammer's oil wealth. Put puzzle pieces together, it fits.

1450 2018-09-12 20:58:41 They are buying cheap gas from Russia piped all over the EU I know  Italy buying it and other countries.
We buy oil from Russia on the market in Holland. It may possible we are buying gas
What will the #brexit effect on gas from Norway be I don't know but some one will know.
1451 2018-09-12 20:58:39 I already know what she will preach...”we must go to war with Syria, Iran”.....Israel and Saudi Arabia crimes will not be mentioned and as a result, US will bomb whoever will not grant them all their oil and gas....
1452 2018-09-12 20:58:34 With a defective oil pump, choose your 20,000 miles carefully!

1458 2018-09-12 20:57:53 

Just massage your cheeks with anointing oil in anti clockwise motion 12.5 times, morning and night for 21 days. 
You'll notice no changes at all. 
1459 2018-09-12 20:57:51 Most of the clients I drive go to Central London, Heathrow, Gatwick or Southampton for onward travel. I drive the M4 when they need me to, these people oil the wheels of Welsh business & talk about how M4 is holding Welsh business back. They make investment decisions daily.
1460 2018-09-12 20:57:34 I’m starving &I want pho! They need to hurry up w this oil change.

1466 2018-09-12 20:57:15 ^I’m gonna try replacing heavy cream with a hefty serving of Parmesan cheese. I also find honey to be a good alternative to sugar in tomato sauces. Vegans, coconut oil can help achieve similar texture to cream/cheese in rose sauce!

1469 2018-09-12 20:57:00 You are blind and seriously misinformed if you think this has anything to do with a single tweet. Musk has been misleading investors for a very long time. This time he went too far.

1512 2018-09-12 20:51:33 Start using Jamaican castor oil it helps with that, instead of lotion. Unlike you I’ve been cursed with my beard for 20 years, and I’ll be 38 next month

Olive oil
Vegan butter
Fresh pepper
Red wine

Mixed it with a marinara added with veggie sausage, lightly sauteed onions, and olives.

1530 2018-09-12 20:48:57 Just in case you thought that any amount of evidence would be enough to convince Republicans to risk sweet oil industry kickbacks.
1531 2018-09-12 20:48:55 Not To Mention My Car Need An Oil Change 
1532 2018-09-12 20:48:51 5) Solar PV has improved its cost basis by more than five thousand times relative to oil since 1970. Currently Solar is on track to improve its cost basis relative to oil by 12,000 times as soon as the year 2020.
1533 2018-09-12 20:47:53 Yes it is Senator, but we also need to stop the lawsuits against the oil companies in Louisiana, so they will increase drilling here
1534 2018-09-12 20:47:44 I wish all these hair products would stop putting castor oil and coconut oil on they labels.. I’m fed up and I just recently went to beauty mart to snag me my go to deep conditioner and it said “new & improved” and I was just over it. Stop fixing something that isn’t broken 
1535 2018-09-12 20:47:42 Damn privileged Saskatchewan NDP.  First he helps shut down their oil industry then he calls them privileged.  How out of touch can you get?
1536 2018-09-12 20:47:27 Just read the article. It really puts it all together in one terrifying package. But when it comes to energy and oil, it all fits as to why the “establishment” won’t allow the USA to be energy independent.
1537 2018-09-12 20:47:26 And none of the 3 exhibit pro-life behavior or voting record... quite to the contrary... all 3 voted to increase the debt ceiling... I cant find the moderate positions(except Cooper who states he believes in American oil&gas, but opposed clean coal and fracking when voting)
1538 2018-09-12 20:47:18 Coconut oil is the one 
1539 2018-09-12 20:46:58 Anytime. I’d go for taking the western province with sll the oil. They might voluntarily join. Let them keep money losing Quebec.
1540 2018-09-12 20:46:53 Good, now all we need to do is burning oil and coal and keep that arctic methane from leaking more

1543 2018-09-12 20:46:23 What this administration has done for Puerto Rico, more correctly NOT done, is a crime. In a world where lives mattered more than money, this would be inexcusable. But it appears there’s no oil or there aren’t enough rich Republicans for Trump to give a shit. #SorryDoesntHelp

1545 2018-09-12 20:46:16 Father what is jojoba oil

It is the oil that comes from the nipples of the child of Santa Claus and Ebenezer Scrooge
1546 2018-09-12 20:46:11 3) Solar is opposite of extraction industries like oil and gas. When China’s demand for oil surged in the last decade, world prices for oil went up by a factor of 10. The higher the demand for oil in Beijing, the higher gasoline prices are in The US, and Europe, etc.
1547 2018-09-12 20:46:08 How much weight did you hang on the front to make it turn on headlands? We loved it but it had the turning circle of an oil tanker! Think the blue one has independent brakes?

1549 2018-09-12 20:45:23 TX is not as far right as people think: Our top 4 cities have Dem mayors; we tax the heck out of oil and gas; we give in-state tuition to undocumented immigrants; & we’re the #1 generator of wind power in the USA. We’ll be a purple state by 2024. 

But, I say Cruz wins 2018 by 5.

1551 2018-09-12 20:45:18 How is oil the byproduct of animal feed. If soya was being grown solely as animal feed the oil wouldn't be extracted from it as whole soya would be a better feed. Is palm oil also a byproduct of animal feed?
1552 2018-09-12 20:45:14 Or the oil revenues out of Iraq would pay for our military adventure there, the supposedly "pre-emptive" war.

1571 2018-09-12 20:42:14 Nope, you don’t add any oil, that’s why it’s called oil less, we could send you a dm to explain the production process if you’re interested.
1572 2018-09-12 20:42:13 Hey @ItsStefi_ , what's the best olive oil? I heard olives from Spain, but I want to ask you since you're the expert.
1573 2018-09-12 20:42:11 People who are deeply invested in the oil industry will fight to keep their product in energy dominance. It’s a lot of people - not just the monied interest, but workers. Any transition must consider that.

1586 2018-09-12 20:40:26 I have a feeling this was Trudeau's end goal all along. Kill Norther gateway Energy east and approve KM knowing it would be shot down by the courts He looks like a good guy after buying it and lets the court do the dirty work but still hurt the oil sands as he trys phasing it out

1597 2018-09-12 20:38:59 Just came back from a veterinary conference where I found more support for lobbying on behalf of hemp and CBD oil than supporting veterinary schools
1598 2018-09-12 20:38:55 Iraq had oil reserves. The “WMD” justification for going in was inaccurate as to type, but since plotters of the 9/11 attack made sure each plane carried a full tank of petrol to incinerate innocents, perhaps not as inaccurate as most imagine.  1/3
1599 2018-09-12 20:38:47 So they’re thinking about making “safe injection sites” but CBD oil is frowned upon and weed is still not legal in many states.... no. fuck that.

1655 2018-09-12 20:33:16 Globalism requires world to merge. U.S has minders & "social massagers" (not messengers)to ensure public outrage & relations with Mohammedans don't spiral out of control,  ruining big business of oil & natural gas. Hamas, the muslim brotherhood, etc., =CIA & Mossad collaborators

1659 2018-09-12 20:33:09 Ignore what? That margarine is made of oil? We knew that. Oil doesn’t mix with water. It’s not showing us anything revolutionary, maybe the honey thing was the only one where I thought “oh that’s cool” but it still doesn’t show it being healthier. Honey is sugar lol not healthy

1670 2018-09-12 20:32:10 The oil is obviously the byproduct of the animal feed industry. Look at it. It's one of the cheapest oils per metric ton. It probably has to be to be competitive to sell it. If you notice it's in so many things, just like another environmentally destructive vegetable oil, palm.

1) 95% of their income is from oil exports and the price of oil has plummeted

1704 2018-09-12 20:27:44 If you use hemp oil cbd, it has zero thc. Canabis oil cbd has small amounts of thc.
Thc is the psychoactive compounds which gets people high. 
I could be wrong, but i think drug tests look for thc and not cbd. So hemp oil cbd should be ok.

1714 2018-09-12 20:25:51 @briansflood I mitigated hurricanes Matthew and Irma by deploying hundreds of gallons of edible soybean oil in front of those storms.

1733 2018-09-12 20:23:37 It was not a bad decision to get into oil. Where would we be without it? We had nothing and we’d have less now. MF was a criminal decision to make, but not all your points are true.

1774 2018-09-12 20:19:08 Quick one guys, can someone mix edibles oil with coconut oil ? And then use it for hair?
1775 2018-09-12 20:19:06 Folks always say "Antigua needs more stuff to do"
Bruv we had the Only oil tanker entertainment park in the  Caribbean and it became "over rated" in less than 5 years. Wdmc lol
1776 2018-09-12 20:19:05 "We must liberate #Alberta’s #oil sands from their landlocked status to dramatically increase Canadian oil #exports &, at the same time, #Canadian power on the international stage. This means completing pipelines like #TM & #EnergyEast"

1778 2018-09-12 20:18:58 You should add the note "which we have continued to support from 20 years on now, buying oil without repercussions even though all the signs highlighted this end." I've seen my country burnt down into flames with the complicity of all the international institutions and countries.

1780 2018-09-12 20:18:56 Even Petrobras have a better run than PVDSA. sanctions weren't applied to oil.
1781 2018-09-12 20:18:54 Last time I checked we weren't an Oil company, The arm of the Gov't that is...well they're a disaster. Our pensioner are are going to be growing in leaps and bounds and with their recent raises...Well! We've been Mismanaged forever but fiscally for last 15 plus years its Nuts!
1782 2018-09-12 20:18:49 What, you have to add your own oil? No thanks.
1783 2018-09-12 20:18:31 Michelle, thank you. I tried turmeric for a short time but my stomach was none too keen. I usually use CBD oil to maintain balance, but it's too expensive for my bank balance at the moment.
1784 2018-09-12 20:18:30 $WTI #crude #oil prices settled higher Wednesday as a large draw in U.S. crude supplies and a drop in output lifted sentiment.
1785 2018-09-12 20:18:18 you obviously be wasting your educational time because i don’t remember the last time the “$” went after the number  PLEASE and also let’s get back to the oil. you never got good oil your two chemists did you FAKE 
1786 2018-09-12 20:18:18 USA Now Largest Global Crude Oil Producer...

Remember in 1970s when we ran out of oil in the US?  Yea, me either.  But the gub'ment lied, printed up Ration Books and almost got away with it!
1787 2018-09-12 20:17:55 Well, if NAFTA was cancelled, Canada could finally stop the oil export proportionality clause. It makes no sense Canada is forced to export oil to US only to often have to buy it back. NAFTA already rather rigged in favour of US imho. And Manitoba hemp milk beats cow’s milk IMO!

1789 2018-09-12 20:17:28 At least @OfficialAPCNg is using the money they borrowed to build a new Nigeria for us all. Building takes time. We understand that. @OfficialPDPNig squandered $500 billion oil earnings in 16 years. @OfficialPDPNig is to blame for Nigeria's misery. Thieves

1795 2018-09-12 20:16:38 I'll snatch that foot, luffa it with rose & pecan shell scrub, then a kneading with rose & mint oil ..........Because I think your worthy of the attention!!!#
1796 2018-09-12 20:16:28 @realDonaldTrump  why are the oil prices going up and when can we get insurance prices across the borders?
1797 2018-09-12 20:16:11 What are you going to do with all that surplus oil  Or are you going to bottle electricity 
1798 2018-09-12 20:15:52 Trumps "Self Interest " is Mind Boggling. 
Most Of History's DICTATORS  were Self Absorbing , Narcistic,  Snake Oil Salesmen ..they Put that IDEA into they're people's heads..if they did not CONFORM..they were TAKEN CARE OF,  and not in the good way..

1800 2018-09-12 20:15:46 Combine 2 cups ham with 11 lbs daily bread. Add generous amounts of Olive Oil. Chill.  Serve on a bed of pasta
1801 2018-09-12 20:15:42 I cooked it in avocado oil and added salt. Usually it is good this way. The kernels were super small as well!
1802 2018-09-12 20:15:38 It's awesome you know how to change breaks.  The dimensions of a parking space should be enough to change the oil.  Not enough for you?
1803 2018-09-12 20:15:33 They say you can catch more flies with honey, but you can catch more fleas with a small dish of cooking oil on the floor, cuz they think it's the secretions of your sebaceous glands and when they come in for a bite they get stuck in it and die. #ProTip #JustTheTip #MadGenius
1804 2018-09-12 20:15:32 I’ve been waiting to get my oil changed for almost two hours 
1805 2018-09-12 20:15:28 funny guy
1806 2018-09-12 20:15:23 Oil?
1807 2018-09-12 20:15:23 It’s difficult to remove so I would recommend maybe coconut oil or something with gentle consistency after you go over it with a wipe (-:
1808 2018-09-12 20:15:16 @AmberocOnline hi how do I order the amberoc elixir hair oil?
1809 2018-09-12 20:15:13 I'd very much like to NOT be subjected to the adds for the millennial vitamin service anymore. I've seen that close-up picture of the pill filled with what looks like miniature cocoa puffs suspended in vegetable oil one too many times. I'm coming apart at the seams here

1818 2018-09-12 20:14:28 It's like a weather forecast-I'll believe it when it happens-We were at over 100 dollar oil just a few years ago-in fact over 150 dollar oil-guess they were living their dream then...
1819 2018-09-12 20:14:27 At some pt it will change as peeps actually analyze the FCF of which many shale have or close to having.  Too many broken record analysts in oil $clr $1b FCF heading to $2b.  People will be bulls w stock at $80.  #actionmonkeyslose
1820 2018-09-12 20:14:04 Is it your building? Why not carefully knock out the infill (that lime putty doesn't look too strong) and see if you find wax or oil stains on the cill.

1824 2018-09-12 20:13:34 Caused largely by nationalizing the oil industry--executive order of their former president, I think. So I'll give Chavez "credit" here.
1825 2018-09-12 20:13:33 Biko, is Kenya not a desert? Is that not why they run the whole world looking like a forgotten Pankere soaked inside used engine oil. You come to Nigeria to compete in Road Race and win. If your country was much better, why you come. 
Next please!
1826 2018-09-12 20:13:28 I’ve come again with your ignorance kindle post the link? Meanwhile we paid our dept when Oil was 20 dollar keep lying.if u know ur correct post the link
1827 2018-09-12 20:13:24 let’s k*ill oil executives
1828 2018-09-12 20:13:12 Right?? How can you paint anything properly with oils, the colors just keep blending and mixing with each other and all, it's so hard. YES oil masters have my utmost respect too, it's unbelievable what some of them can do
1829 2018-09-12 20:12:54 bro i’m just tryna get my oil changes i don’t want a 30 minute conversation while we sit in this freezing waiting room.
1830 2018-09-12 20:12:36 The fumes from the oil paint in Calkins are gettin to me 
1831 2018-09-12 20:12:31 Ditto. I took an even bigger hit with the downturn in the oil industry as my business is connected to it. I'm trying one last thing soon & if no improvement by next financial year, I'm going to close the door & sell up.
1832 2018-09-12 20:12:22 Snake oil.
1833 2018-09-12 20:11:58 Modi Ji, You are giving chance to the people to speak out against you just because of petroleum prices. people will easily forget the noble work you are doing. So please do something try to reduce the oil prices. so that AAM ADMI can have relief in their life.

1838 2018-09-12 20:11:30 Oil
1839 2018-09-12 20:11:23 Thanks for the reply, my question was to indicate that actually its none of my business what people do with their own money. I'm not interested how much he earns or anyone else. I'm interested in how much oil will be produced from the Weald for my benefit & the country's.
1840 2018-09-12 20:11:14 Ain’t shit slick to a can of oil 
1841 2018-09-12 20:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza for lunch today will be: sad crust with wet motor oil and mushroom.
1842 2018-09-12 20:11:04 [huffs] Can we /start/ with the backup plan? [the grass outside of the hedgemaze is not soaked in oil]
1843 2018-09-12 20:11:00 What I miss as an adult... toys in the waiting room. Like how fun would it be to put together a lego car while waiting to get your oil changed?  Instead, you just have to pretend to look at your phone for an hour.
1844 2018-09-12 20:10:50 Maybe you should stop making laws that favor oil companies
1845 2018-09-12 20:10:48 $38m is annual cash revenue, do you have idea, what’s the NPV of these cash flows or NPV of potential size of Balcombe? Adding more, analyst are looking for $100/b oil by Dec after USA sanctions on Iran in November
1846 2018-09-12 20:10:46 Rub some peppermint essential oil on where the pain is! Def lay in a dark room with your eyes closed and try to not look at your phone, that’s what works for me!
1847 2018-09-12 20:10:42 Sir Sorry to say, We are oil importing country. If our companies don’t make profit & then don’t harvest that profit to Innovate & Find New India Oil Reserves & then extract it so as to cut imports, then we can’t be self reliant in Fuels.
Need to stop fiscal profiteering plz
1848 2018-09-12 20:10:35 Lower and upper combined yes. Balcombe will just be testing the upper. As for how much oil? Ask Nutech.
1849 2018-09-12 20:10:28 I’m waiting for my oil change and I’m currently looking up puppies for no reason and now I just might have to come home with one, sorry laur.

1851 2018-09-12 20:10:14 I thought the purpose of that was to peddle snake oil?
1852 2018-09-12 20:10:13 Only two male kittens— one black, one brown— remain, the others already adopted out to new homes. “They’re brothers. Oil and water, the both of ‘em, but they’ve got their own charms and are almost inseparable. Good luck.”

1859 2018-09-12 20:09:29 Ill advised equity stake in oil and gas. You know any oil companies losing money? So we were swimming in money until MF and then we were broke overnight. I see. What happened to the public pension fund I wonder?
1860 2018-09-12 20:09:27 How do i use it ? Like a oil ?

1863 2018-09-12 20:09:05 Have you tried tea tree oil as a remedy? It disinfects and gives a cooling sensation (just dilute it with a bit of water before application)
1864 2018-09-12 20:09:02 Sorry kid, I don't want to ruin your fary tale, but that  was driven by oil revenues. That level of extreme poverty is worring, Uruguay has 0.9%, so decreasing from 20% is not a big deal. Same for the other indicators, that are level of a poor country still being poor.

1867 2018-09-12 20:08:34 No one should ever let me loose to do adulting. Currently cackling at the trash country song (trust me) playing while being forced to view Fox News waiting for my oil change-How will I make it out alive?
1868 2018-09-12 20:08:21 Gas price going up instead . Who is pro humanity now? Oil industry ?
1869 2018-09-12 20:08:15 This oil change about to cost me my right arm
1870 2018-09-12 20:08:10 It just ended up being this strange mix of two styles that DO NOT mix. Like water and oil, it was like watching two movies in one.
1871 2018-09-12 20:08:09 Had to take CBD oil. The pain in my legs are unbearable
1872 2018-09-12 20:08:08 I sub it for mayo and just add a touch of olive oil and ground pepper.

1874 2018-09-12 20:07:58 but in telling the truth Africa has to move from commodity based economies for instance one barrol of crude oil they can buy from Nigeria Angola they will issue $ 70 but for BP has the capacity of having $235 in doing the math one can see that Africa is short changed
1875 2018-09-12 20:07:55 In the context of what wwf was at the time. Of course you’d see a story of evil father and son trying to wrestle the company back from a drunk asshole, after the evil fathers wife sold her shares to him. The show is built around wrestling and not oil like in Dallas, so of course
1876 2018-09-12 20:07:43 This snake oil salesman....this Manchurian....this saboteur....needs to go away for good!
1877 2018-09-12 20:07:40 He/she spilled the oil.?.
1878 2018-09-12 20:07:32 Centre has collected huge amount of money on Oil forms. Where is swatch bharath and make in India, will they convert it as bjp party fund or Amith shah bank illegal funds. If you question anyone you should be perfect..If you need to know the development come with me.

1885 2018-09-12 20:06:17 Let me just list all the drivers I know, and I'm not an expert. 1/ Iran squeeze 2/ Shale oil output drops and 3/ Hurricane Florence could disrupt crude pipelines.
1886 2018-09-12 20:06:01 How and where exactly do we apply these oils, and also fragranced dry oil?
1887 2018-09-12 20:05:52 I like to low key VAPE at home. Maybe a nice aromatherapy oil. I save all my SICK VAPE action for when I'm at the VAPE shop so my fellow VAPErs can be jealous of my SICK VAPE moves.
1888 2018-09-12 20:05:39 Ohh u know Iran has oil by which it survive it has made its own industries,what has pakistan done to be self sufficient, nothing Pakistani govt is asking it’s own ppl to donate for damn dude. U need to understand in today’s scenario it’s almost impossible to survive in isolation
1889 2018-09-12 20:05:38 Just convinced my friend to buy CBD oil because her job is high stress but she can’t be high and I feel like I have done a good deed.
1890 2018-09-12 20:05:30 I stir fry it! I chop the leaves but slice the stems super thin on a bias. I use sweet soy, sesame oil, sambal, oyster sauce on it

1892 2018-09-12 20:05:12 Essential oil
1893 2018-09-12 20:05:00 not just oil our electronic equipment & capital goods imports are also increasing by the month. These are rather sticky. But, agrochem intermediates, api and starting material imports can be substituted. This is another tailwind for chemical companies as govt support is there.
1894 2018-09-12 20:04:47 I grew up in Cushing Oklahoma the pipeline cross roads of the United States. It has been a fact for a long time that the United States has more oil than any other country on this planet. We produce more oil than we did in 1970 but price is 10 times higher now. #scam

1901 2018-09-12 20:03:45 They said the abandoned factory was dangerous. They didn’t say why. Walking through the ruins you hardly notice the puddle of iridescent black machine oil you’re about to step into until you do, and plunge into what is definitely not a puddle, but a deep pool.
1902 2018-09-12 20:03:37 that nun told me liked to smell rock oil. Virgins go mad in the end I

Because it isn't enough to risk young lives to secure oil reserves  & other business interests, we also need to get them in the debt cycle.

1908 2018-09-12 20:03:03 We, the UK’s disabled, are fair game to the Tory Government and we all have a right to protest. Many disabled people have died due to Austerity. If we were an oil rich country they’d be screaming Genocide!! That said MP’s children are not fair game, ever.

1912 2018-09-12 20:02:36 I was just thinking the same thing, and wondering if speed has anything to do with it.  I still think the streets should be gravel or oil pack. That would 'calm' the traffic. If not - 8' lanes.

1937 2018-09-12 19:59:48 Iran is starting to store oil on its fleet of supertankers again as impending U.S. sanctions force the Persian Gulf country to revive a strategy it deployed under previous curbs.

1955 2018-09-12 19:58:08 More, bigger storms because the ocean surface temp is the warmest in recorded history. And warming. 

There is no doubt it is caused by man burning fossil fuels.  Even the oil companies say this. The only deniers are the Kochs currently serving GOP politicians and their voters.

1967 2018-09-12 19:56:33 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.

1969 2018-09-12 19:56:17 We should be happy that it’s on full display. Many Americans were bamboozled by the last silver tongued snake oil salesmen that was in office. I’d rather have someone who puts all his thoughts out there for critique, than someone whom is quiet & deceiving.

1981 2018-09-12 19:55:01 I mostly agree. To me, the big question (nyt headline aside!) is how much oil and gas we’d produce in a rising interest rate environment where companies also had to live within cash flow?

All paid by tax and sovereign/nationalised oil. A sad comparison to Britain which sold is North Sea oil.
1990 2018-09-12 19:54:30 Right!  Canada should remain the laughing stock of the world keeping its oil in the ground.  Only losers would think this way......or globalist environmental nutbars.

2026 2018-09-12 19:50:48 Yes. There was a generation of engineers who travelled the country changing the big oil burners over to gas. 
2027 2018-09-12 19:50:46 Coming from you, who's barely old enough to know what you're talking about. Rather than jumping on the Labour bandwagon for everything free in life and pay tomorrow. Maybe you should take time to sit and think, and stay quiet, rather than unleashing the filth from your mouth.
2028 2018-09-12 19:50:32 @POTUS Dear Mr. Presidet,
I've rumors that we have a huge amount oil just under our poor undemocratic countries here in Europe. Just saying...

2030 2018-09-12 19:50:16 Tuscan peppers for a starter. Red peppers, anchovies, capers, garlic, olive oil. Loads of recipes on line. Anything pavlova-like for a pud. Or pears in red wine and nutty biscuits for those who can eat gluten.
2031 2018-09-12 19:49:54 @AsdaServiceTeam my partner has just slipped and fallen in your Northwich store on some oil that was on the floor. I know accidents happen but 3 staff members were right next to us and did nothing! Absolutely shocking they didn't even bother with her! #disappointed
2032 2018-09-12 19:49:52 Yeah I go there for oil changes and they forgot to put this cover back on underneath my car all the way so I was driving and it was dragging on the ground so I’m done

2039 2018-09-12 19:49:15 Well, maybe if you didn't run a horizontal monopoly, you'd still have your oil companies
2040 2018-09-12 19:49:13 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
2041 2018-09-12 19:49:05 11 years of oil industry leadership experience? At a guess...
2042 2018-09-12 19:48:57 Saw the research team's presentation last year in Halifax, attended by community leaders including from Chesterfield Inlet. Impressive how the community and researchers are working together to improve oil spill response and protect the environment.

2046 2018-09-12 19:48:41 Surely that is up and down? MAGA hats below and drumpf above. The hair oil poisoning probably isn’t helping either.
2047 2018-09-12 19:48:40 US dollar fell sharply after positive news on trade, boosting AUD and NZD. The US and Canada were reportedly nearing agreement, and the US and China may start fresh talks. Short maturity US bond yields also rose, and oil made a four-month high, while US equities were unchanged.

2063 2018-09-12 19:47:16 By producing vast amounts of oil, Gulf countries have amassed enormous wealth, for themselves. Nothing wrong. Haven’t seen their compassionate side though. Has anyone?

2065 2018-09-12 19:47:02 I agree with the benefits . Personally it's not for me because I don't like the high feeling but if it works for others I can totally respect it.I have friends who smoke and use the oil and swear by it!

2068 2018-09-12 19:46:26 Might also be something you need to stop? Spoke to someone today who said coconut oil on her scalp causes it to itch very badly. So maybe remove coconut and/or olive oil if you use either and see if that helps. Lavender/rosemary/eucalyptus also do good for me.

Tankers and tankers for you guys to photo it is going to be great.

2081 2018-09-12 19:44:43 You missed the point entirely (most liberals do)

2087 2018-09-12 19:44:27 You were already politically correct. It started small scale 80s/90s. I remember a little book. It was a bit of a joke. It was to soften people up, looking back. Cultural Marxism and oil. Money and arms. The left and power. A potent combination.
2088 2018-09-12 19:44:22 These may be dumb questions… But… How do you use it? Do you use a diffuser? Do you actually put the oil on your skin?
2089 2018-09-12 19:44:02 Agreed. I used to joke about Canada being Venezuela North 8 or 10 months ago. Little did I know. Oil rich country. Driven into the ground by socialists. SMH.

2107 2018-09-12 19:42:55 Halfway through the day and only ate 7.5 grams of carbs. Drank 5 ounces of oilve oil for breakfast and just now starting to get hungry. #ketolife
2108 2018-09-12 19:42:46 If you ask me it has more of an alcohol vibe. Looks like a bottle of slivovitz. And, as far as I know you should store olive oil in dark bottles so that  chemical structure of the oil won't get destroyed by the sun.
2109 2018-09-12 19:42:32 I'm sure you defended Obama the same way during the BP oil spill while the @GOP were criticizing him too right? Of course not because you #Hypocrites put party over country

2123 2018-09-12 19:40:59 Are you really that dim? The oil will run out sometime in the next century...maybe...IF no more sources are found. Seriously unlikely that energy companies will stop looking for new sources. Given a century, more or less, to try to make 'renewable' also profitable, it might work.
2124 2018-09-12 19:40:42 Well simply because you never heard something doesn’t mean it’s not true and yes lower oil prices are bad for the energy sector which factors into our GDP number which contributed to its drop

2133 2018-09-12 19:39:34 Yeah but we only produce a small fraction of the world's oil supply where, the Middle East produces over 75% I don't agree with the President but People focus on US shortcomings and there are many and ignore child slave or women in China making $.20 a hr making Nike's

2151 2018-09-12 19:37:51 Not correct. If salmon are the target for protection, then the aim should be to get the dilbit off the rails since oil-by-rail runs along our most endangered salmon habitats. The pipeline would decrease the risk to this species

2160 2018-09-12 19:36:26 Pumpkin spice, white chocolate, and the caramel sauce (caramel macchiatos) all have dairy! Anything with cold foam is made out of dairy as well. On the bright side there’s vegan bagels (without oil) and vegan cookies and there’s a lot of really awesome dairy free drinks(:

2162 2018-09-12 19:36:24 Asgard Celtic Embossed Belt. Our most popular embossing pattern. The heat from the brass embossing wheel brings up the oil in the leather and gives it a beautiful contrast.

2163 2018-09-12 19:36:11 the only long term stuff that’s worked has been some prescribed steroid cream that i cant rmr the name of, but for day to day dryness/temporary relief i like vitamin e oil, epsom salt, and i switched my body wash to castile soap and my skin feels much better using that
2164 2018-09-12 19:36:08 Gee since the economy is blooming and Obama took credit for that is he to be congratulated for the oil production too?
2165 2018-09-12 19:36:05 Squeaky wheel gets the oil.  Lol. Woof woof.
2166 2018-09-12 19:35:57 Why do you ask cause for now most muslims countries are at war for oil and power which the war was started by the west to destabilise and cause disunity amongs them so the west gets cheap oil from the muslim whom they gave guns to my understanding muslims were nomads heading goat
2167 2018-09-12 19:35:46 You're late: "The latest global oil and natural gas production statistics back up Obama’s claim. The United States has been the world’s largest oil producer since 2012, and the largest natural gas producer for years. We rate his statement True."
2168 2018-09-12 19:35:32 Dr Oz is a snake oil salesman.
2169 2018-09-12 19:35:32 You don’t know me but have you ever tried CBD oil or edibles? I went from sleeping 4-5 hours to 8-9 a night taking 12-15 mg gummies. There’s plenty of evidence online if you want to read about it.
2170 2018-09-12 19:35:27 What work would that be? Invading sovereign nations for oil? Free job giveaways to foreign nations instead of domestically? Increased income inequality?

2175 2018-09-12 19:35:06 Iceland are committed to removing plastic from their own products. The new fresh steak packaging is brilliant. They're also going palm oil free 
2176 2018-09-12 19:35:01 I am shocked CNN reported this.  I guess they can always spin this as a negative because crude oil destroys the whole world....

I think it's long overdue.
2177 2018-09-12 19:35:00 Throwing a little fresh chain oil on always has this effect on me.
2178 2018-09-12 19:34:55 I switched over to Gun Oil and so far I’m happy with it.
2179 2018-09-12 19:34:42 If there's anything I swear by, it's olive oil
2180 2018-09-12 19:34:41 Plus the energy sector leveled out due to lower oil prices
2181 2018-09-12 19:34:23 @KoinangeJeff Jeff you have hit it right, "borrowing to finance corruption"! Jeff kindly ask why are we not reviving the "dead" oil refinery or building a new one! We have our very own crude oil, we shouldn't be suffering this much!!
2182 2018-09-12 19:34:01 The OP was about club stature and history so yeah I have the balls to say Spurs have more stature and history than a team bought by oil
2183 2018-09-12 19:33:59 Pattern of lower trending crude oil through the day along with equity buying is the expected pattern going forward.
2184 2018-09-12 19:33:56 The US want control of the Oil... 300,000 barrels /day, so Syria can't rebuild using it's own asses. 
If Russia/Iran go close it'll be WW3!

I wish they could!... Would solve at lot of problems... a lot of jobs, full bellies & a rebuilt country!

2187 2018-09-12 19:33:48 As long as the US is getting paid to protect Euro, the Assad/Putin relationship is a threat because of the oil.
2188 2018-09-12 19:33:41 He's incorrect. It happened under Pres.

2190 2018-09-12 19:33:24 When I feel disconnected from myself, I like to take care of my personal hygiene to get back in touch. I shower, do my hair & nails, brush my teeth, wear a nice oil/perfume, clean my room & burn incense, make my bed, etc. It helps me feel grounded, safe & refocused 
2191 2018-09-12 19:33:24 I had to listen to the whole song. That was cool

2201 2018-09-12 19:32:49 I wonder if they thought of drafting guys who can hit, instead of drafting pitchers who can supposedly pitch but can't. Recent attendance suggests the Phillies are becoming the Marlins and fans are too smart to buy the shit they are putting on the field KlentakKapler's snake oil.

2215 2018-09-12 19:31:39 FERN is an excellent resource for understanding the erroneous assumptions, dubious science, and environmental racism of offsets and pollution trading. California is doing nothing to take oil and gas extraction to zero and instead relies on offsetting and carbon accounting tricks.

2272 2018-09-12 19:25:26 well US puts sanctions on every country that has oil that they cannot control like iran and north korea but other countries like Libya, Iraq and others it’s fine because eventually the money goes to US accounts since they’re controlling them

2274 2018-09-12 19:25:08 Good point. I think any of the presidential credit-taking is stupid. The reason we're producing more can be boiled down to something very, very simple: Bakken has far more oil than we originally thought it did.

2282 2018-09-12 19:24:31 I got told my oil change would take an hour, that was at 10:30. It is now almost 1:30 and they just barely took it in. To say I’m frustrated is an understatement 
2283 2018-09-12 19:24:30 The average has been 40-50 for around 9 years, first step is to become energy independent, which is improving as the US just became worlds largest producer of crude oil and better negotiations. Financial problem is the debt & looking for sources to continually fund it! Be Well!
2284 2018-09-12 19:24:28 There are no direct subsidies for the oil and gas industry in New Zealand - Greenpeace have their facts wrong. Look at page 153 of the Productivity Commission's report into a lower emissions economy last week which dispels this myth.

2289 2018-09-12 19:23:52 and my great grandparents (christian) used to eat with their neighbours who were muslim. but oil had to fk that up and cause more genocide on both sides. wonder why? same repetition in Syria. I freaked out. same in Myanmar (china and Myanmar military) same world wide.
2290 2018-09-12 19:23:48 Sorry to hear that. 
I’m using the CBD+ from Holland and Barrett. It’s the 2.75% in the 30ml bottle, using 3 drops around 3 times a day. 
There are quite a lot of resources online for CBD oil and groups that could maybe help you find another one to try?

2347 2018-09-12 19:17:31 There is a chance of a lot of internal strife between OPEC if after the Iran sanctions all the lost Iran oil production will be absorbed by other OPEC producers increasing their production. Iran may exit out of the coalition if things go south.

2354 2018-09-12 19:16:13 A1: answering as a male mentor to a woman’s network in oil and gas, one key barrier to gender parity appears to me to be entry to these professions in the first place. Just look at how few females graduate from engineering schools. #NextChat

2414 2018-09-12 19:09:26 @howardkremer Brodie is right the sunken ship in Pearl Harbor is to this day still slowly leaking oil. Bc it’s a grave site no effort has been made to fix the issue as doing so may disrupt the final resting place of all the fallen sailors who’s body’s are still down there.
2415 2018-09-12 19:09:21 Some religions in western civilization are like oil and water. They simply don’t mix and never will. Ask them basic questions: Are men & women equal? Are gays acceptable? Is civil law supreme? Oil & water.

Why are vehicles so expensive?

2432 2018-09-12 19:07:47 Really excited about my new coconut oil, why am I this lame help
2433 2018-09-12 19:07:46 This nice weather and being off early was the perfect chance to get oil and car cleaning done that I was too lazy to do earlier this week. How perfect.
2434 2018-09-12 19:07:46 山田家デザインベイビー説とか…めっちゃ興奮するわ……
2435 2018-09-12 19:07:23 Ahhh Liberal. Come on down here and see how many families in this "rich" province are standing in lines for food banks. But we still send. Wed rather pay the Saudis for oil. 
2436 2018-09-12 19:07:08 Russia & Iran Co...with the Oil as the prime objective?
2437 2018-09-12 19:07:06 Forget, oil money is still lucrative.
2438 2018-09-12 19:06:53 I hate fish oil pills!! I know when I need to stop taking them because I burp sushi for a week with out having to eat it
2439 2018-09-12 19:06:52 That’s a ridiculous argument. Aberdeen has a 38k average salary and 25% migration: wouldn’t happen to do with that giant North Sea oil industry meaning people flock there? Worcester has no industry compared to London, hence huge numbers travelling to London.
2440 2018-09-12 19:06:43 In a large pot, lightly brown 2 large onions in olive oil. Add some capers, little bay leaf. Add 2 dozen de-shelled, cleaned crabs. When they turn red, add enough crushed tomatoes to cover crabs. Let them simmer on low/medium flame for about 3 hours stirring occasionally. Yummy
2441 2018-09-12 19:06:40 I knew it.

2442 2018-09-12 19:06:23 sure! I pretty much have mine down; I use jojoba oil, moisturize, glass file, keep nail polish on. It works pretty well for me ~
2443 2018-09-12 19:06:21 Rice is easy. Heat a small amount veg oil in a pan, fry rice for a minute. For every cup of rice, add about 1.5-1.75 cups of boiling water. Cover tightly, use a bit of tinfoil under lid if it's leaky, and simmer on lowest setting for 15 minutes. Off heat for 5, fluff and serve.

2445 2018-09-12 19:06:04 Well AK does get to open ANWR. I always thought ANWR was a strategic easy to tap reserve. With 50 years of oil left, the country that can make its military move last wins..that will not be the US as Russia has vastly larger reserves.
2446 2018-09-12 19:05:55 It seems that the people who think veg oil is important also tend to be the ones who think calories are important. (Just pointing out some inconsistency--or maybe unintended consequences--in the whole French fry thing.)
2447 2018-09-12 19:05:38 By the way, recall my claim some years ago: I am not doing this environmental politics thing. Turns out that's a bit difficult to avoid if you're interested in oil and gas companies, the political economy of development, the future of the planet and small things like that.
2448 2018-09-12 19:05:37 First this is a petroleum fight , superpowers want to take our oil , second superpowers selling us arms to fight inside our countries !
2449 2018-09-12 19:05:34 So when @taynikole_ and I were just dating I would buy her flowers and stuffed animals but now that we’re married I get her oil changed, put air in her tires and fill up her tank so she doesn’t have to

2461 2018-09-12 19:03:27 Fraser oil did they go out of business?
2462 2018-09-12 19:03:22 Due to what?  In Louisiana, there is a real problem of oil and gas extraction near the shore actually lowering the land and causing sea ingress.  In Miami and Manhattan, there's building in flood zones.  What's in VA?
2463 2018-09-12 19:03:19 Just do a quick check on crude oil price in last 10 years before putting up the figures.

2468 2018-09-12 19:02:28 Congrats? It's still shitty to base foreign policy around oil not humanitarian motivations. Just my 2 cents.
2469 2018-09-12 19:02:14 So easy.  Peel each spud.  Cut lots of slices into spuds but don't cut right through!  Put on a greased baking tray, having rolled them around a bit in the oil first so there's some on top too and then cook.  That's it.

2472 2018-09-12 19:01:55 Everyone Trump appointed was geared to help big business, big oil & privatization. The stock market is doing so well because those are the entities that are profiting by his platform.
His Regime could care less about the everyday guy/gal.
Which is why he ran GOP.
All the same.

2474 2018-09-12 19:01:44 Tip of the day:
Use extra virgin olive oil: it leads to many beneficial effects on heart health, and people who consume olive oil have a much lower risk of dying from heart attacks and strokes!

Also, with those two particular ladies, the less I see, the better.

2496 2018-09-12 18:59:47 I don't smoke weed I did 20 years ago in High School(guess why they call it that) but anyway I get paranoid so it's not for me.I hear the oil that don't get you high works well.Never tried it though
2497 2018-09-12 18:59:44 You would never be able to make it complaint with today's smog rules.  It would require a very large exhaust scrubber and carbon sequestration equipment.  Even a oil burner smokes alot when accelerating, decelerating, and idling.
2498 2018-09-12 18:59:41 Leaving Sahara Oil and Gas Group to run for the office of the governor of Rivers State is gut, Tonye Cole I hope they won't use & dump you
2499 2018-09-12 18:59:34 Incomparable. You can’t compare post World War II to post oil crisis Europe. Meaningless. Do you know about devaluation in ‘69, 3 day week, power cuts & industrial decline? We were “sick man of Europe”. Absurd to deny we’ve outperformed our competitors, when based on actual data

2503 2018-09-12 18:59:14 Things I did when my hair stopped growing: shampoo more (too much cowashing &heavy products were clogging pores), deep condition biweekly, castor oil to prevent breakage, scalp massages w. tea tree oil to stimulate scalp, trim every 3-6 month or as needed, low manipulative styles

2520 2018-09-12 18:57:23 They will stay to:
1. Asset strip the oil for themselves.. a potential 300,000 Barrels/Day!
2. To stop Syria using the asset to rebuild the country.
3. To try and split Syria to create a potential zone of conflict, perhaps a bit like E/W Germany after WW2.
Who's going to stop it?

I do, however have plenty of cheese. 
If I get back into wanting to eat eggs & toast, maybe butter will return, but olive oil is a tasty substitute.

India shall continue to purchase oil from Iran.

India is not #PigmyPakistan to be pushed.
We pay for our Purchases in Hard Cash, Unlike #PigmyPakistan that begs for even 8F16s
2545 2018-09-12 18:53:00 For the same reason the left deconstructs any supporting evidence as paid for by the oil industry. You can't have it both ways. The govt has a narrative that they buy & pay for so we should just let their "expertise" guide us? Nope. Empirical evidence proves that govt lies to us

2555 2018-09-12 18:52:03 Do we really produce more oil than Saudi Arabia? Russia?
2556 2018-09-12 18:51:46 It's almost like something has fundamentally changed... i wonder what that could be... cuz the politicians are all still bought, the civil service fully captured... 

What has the oil industry finally realized?

2570 2018-09-12 18:50:08 What would u do if you didnt know how light travels through olive oil
2571 2018-09-12 18:50:08 I've been pouring olive oil into my ears for the last two weeks to try and clear my blocked ears but doc has now prescribed almond oil (bless u NHS ) Thinking about chucking some flour and sugar in there as well and hoping my brain bakes something tasty 
2572 2018-09-12 18:50:03 Jetzt bei SWR3: Midnight Oil - Beds are burning
2573 2018-09-12 18:50:01 Good question. It’s because of all the free stuff. I think @realDonaldTrump should make all points of their deembarcation should provide a tanker of oil every month until they go home. Why should America pay for their expenses?
2574 2018-09-12 18:49:46 She’s gonna Wesson Oil all over that place!
2575 2018-09-12 18:49:29 Rathee, teri buddhi naathi!

2579 2018-09-12 18:49:03 *ewa aganyin. More like beans and lots of oil
2580 2018-09-12 18:49:03 its cooked in a separate vat of oil, but when the oil is cleaned (at the end of the day) it all gets put sucked into the same pan, and the fish vat is often (true of the 2 stores I have worked at) close to the chicken vat, and therefore oil cross contamination is likely
2581 2018-09-12 18:49:02 Crude oil Oct18 72 Calls trade 100 times
2582 2018-09-12 18:49:00 YAY! Yay for getting rid of all of those horrible regulations that protected the environment! Yay! Let's all swim in crude oil, wrap ourselves in asbestos, and eat  chlorpyrifos! And while we're at it, let's cut billions of dollars going to the USDA and FDA! Yippee!
2583 2018-09-12 18:48:55 First, media isn't silent, reported on cnn, cbs, etc.
Second, your refineries are still dependent on foreign oil.
Third, you can't breathe money.
2584 2018-09-12 18:48:41 You could fund it by redirecting some of the millions spent by foreign oil companies on lobbying our politicians!
2585 2018-09-12 18:48:39 I want my mom's (and grandma's) homemade fried chicken, the one dipped in soy sauce and fried in oil lol :(
2586 2018-09-12 18:48:33 Hey Justin do you mind if take your oil from under the earth since Canada does not want it and the oil flows across borders underground
2587 2018-09-12 18:48:32 It will stay the fastest growing religion
No one can change that
It is Allah's promise
2588 2018-09-12 18:48:23 How @ tax chori and high court order, how @ NPA growth from 2006 to 2008, how @Manmohan Singh’s acceptance of doing worst thing to issue oil bonds, very conveniently side lined, ppl are not fool like..., if you have self respect then accept Congress failures, don’t shoot in air
2589 2018-09-12 18:48:20 I need to cut my hair but I can't find my clipper oil
2590 2018-09-12 18:48:16 This dude asked me to come see him I said I need gas, a tire & a oil change ask me if he replied 
2591 2018-09-12 18:48:02 Yeah that's never pertained to us Americans. We like that RICH ARAB OIL. The good stuff
2592 2018-09-12 18:47:57 Bless my boyfriend for taking the Red Rocket to get her oil changed and cleaned 
2593 2018-09-12 18:47:45 That doesn't disprove that 9/11 occurred as reported, it just shows that the US protected the Saudi's from criticism because we needed their oil at the time.  That has been known for 17 years. That is  why we need to drill more here so we can starve them there.
2594 2018-09-12 18:47:40 This is just not that hard. Tax remittances through a 12.5% tax on foreign wire transfers. The greatest source of income generated in Mexico (now more than oil exports) & Central America is money sent home by citizens working abroad. The $25 B for the wall is paid for in 3 years.
2595 2018-09-12 18:47:26 THANKS OBAMA (no, literally, shale oil exploded under the guy in 2014)
2596 2018-09-12 18:47:23 As this Farm Girl dined at a Denver yuppie place yesterday, I wondered which dining "city folk" probably double hate guys like me because they already hate farmers, ranchers, roustabouts, fishermen, loggers & gas/oil/mineral producers & they hate @realDonaldTrump, OUR president.
2597 2018-09-12 18:46:58 *US invaded itself for its own oil*

2599 2018-09-12 18:46:44 do you ever look at a side by side photograph of a lettuce leaf dressed with only vinegar and a lettuce leaf dressed with only oil and think "fascinating" 
2600 2018-09-12 18:46:33 Offttt you yoon media are fucking panicking. I dont see you mention revenues have risen why is that BBC ? Oh and do not forget the new oil fields that were found. This gonna be the new punt that oil is running out again ? Lmao

2604 2018-09-12 18:46:12 I use organic coconut oil for everything and almost all of my beauty products are made from coconut; coconut oil hair mask and hair mist, coconut water vaginal wash, coconut milk exfoliate. Coconut beauty products are life 
2605 2018-09-12 18:46:08 Doug, if we hadn’t had a load of greedy crooked Labour councillors in the 60s & 70s Dundee would’ve been the oil capital. The oil companies saw them for what they were and went north.
2606 2018-09-12 18:46:06 me eating Thai food at work: oh man, I got oil on my notes

2608 2018-09-12 18:45:37 Interesting case regarding Guyana and who is responsible for promoting business within the country. Connection to news about Venezuela trying to promote their oil companies again - who should bear the weight of that decision? #augedc
2609 2018-09-12 18:45:33 Moreover, the huge coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska: he was head of the bill that allows the oil and gas cos to mine directly THROUGH and ON the migration routes of rhe Porcupine Elk, 
routes essential for tbe breed' survival.
2610 2018-09-12 18:45:33 You can exfoliate your lips once a week by using sugar and olive oil.
2611 2018-09-12 18:45:21 Israel is a #Rothschild property & problem, they own it, it makes them loads of monies, through sales of military equipment, & construction projects, last one is Golan Heights oil exploitation - I hope @PutinRF_Eng will frustrate them @KremlinRussia_E @RT_com @SputnikInt @Ruptly

2616 2018-09-12 18:45:03 Marinated in olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic.  Then barbeques to medium rare and have a nice lemon juice, olive oil salt pepper and oregano ju to spread over it whilst on the grill. Yuuuuum. GOOD EATS Y'all
2617 2018-09-12 18:44:57 Coal oil, lovage and turnip jus. That's enough to make your teeth squeak. #GreatBritishMenu
2618 2018-09-12 18:44:55 #DidYouKnow America has now surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia and is now the largest global crude oil producer? 

For some reason it's not being talked about across the major news networks @CNN @ABC @CBSNews @NBCNews but it's nice to not be reliant on foreign oil. 

Thoughts?
2619 2018-09-12 18:44:41 Uhm ok, i dunno which fetishes you’re into but i’ll get you your motor oil

2622 2018-09-12 18:44:30 Oh, you mean that one got torn apart by the Western world because of oil through all kinds of unjustified military interventions, regime takedowns, and wars? While the other was mostly left alone? 
2623 2018-09-12 18:44:29 Anyone wearing AND1 slip-ons in the year 2018 will DEFINITELY tell you about how they almost got arrested over an oil stain
2624 2018-09-12 18:44:27 I can check my oil and I'll get filthy, anythin involving an engine is 100% mess, people who stay pristine are either the most coordinated ppl ever or just lozzakin and doin fuck all
2625 2018-09-12 18:44:24 Twitter girls and clothes, water and oil same WhatsApp group.
2626 2018-09-12 18:44:19 Mr Higgins should probably just wear his oil company ball cap; and we wouldn’t have to listen to his BS. Actually, there are countries that are on a schedule to switch to renewables in the near future. But, their governments are not owned by Big Oil.
2627 2018-09-12 18:44:18 @GiveBloodNHS brilliant experience as usual at #Alton #Blood given, and I was told it goes to babies :)
2628 2018-09-12 18:44:10 The characteristics of ingredients =/= the characteristics resulting from different cooking processes, usually irreversible chemical reactions (although vegetable oil is deplorable)
2629 2018-09-12 18:44:08 So you oppose a pipeline but are fine with rail cars full of oil running adjacent to lakes, rivers and streams that have fish not to mention rolling right by people’s homes in Surrey.  #Hypocrisy #BCPoli
2630 2018-09-12 18:44:00 Have you ever tried CBD oil?  I swear it's a gift from the heavens.. I'm not a bandwagon jumper, but I bought it cause I had tennis elbow in both arms and was getting no relief...After a week or two on the oil, it subsided, and I noticed my moods were better.  Gotta buy more soon
2631 2018-09-12 18:43:40 I am dead  So why am I up here getting an oil change and they locked my keys in the car. 
2632 2018-09-12 18:43:38 But I won't believe any oil company's estimate of how much gas was flared into the atmosphere every minute of every hr of every day since the Bakken Boom took off.    For ND govt. its $$$ over people, as I experienced.
2633 2018-09-12 18:43:35 I've got a store near me called Oliveto that makes their own real truffle infused olive oil in house.
2634 2018-09-12 18:43:25 Two methods. Leave in- oil- cream. 

Or leave in -cream- oil. 
Try out both. 

Also don’t use a lot. Start at tips and finger comb through saturating the hair , work it into the hair. Lots of products don’t mind well together (like Cantu and other shit)

2706 2018-09-12 18:36:01 Maybe. I just think there's still a not-ready for prime-time aspect to the CNY given K/A convertibility. But the EZ has 4 oil majors, the world's most internationally active banks, a freely tradeable currency, comprises 20% of global reserves and imports as much oil as CN.
2707 2018-09-12 18:35:50 There is absolutely nothing worse than having a Fish Oil capsule explode and spew all over everything, making all things in the world smell like stinky fish!! 
2708 2018-09-12 18:35:38 Yes, most of our taxes should only go to oil wars that only benefit billionaires. They're thankful for the mindless idiots that do their bidding.
2709 2018-09-12 18:35:33 Love it!  Obviously Confederation is not working for Alberta.  If we joined the US we would make them an energy superpower and frustrate Trudeau’s plan to phase out the oil sands.

2715 2018-09-12 18:34:58 Which Obama regulations would that be? The regulations to protect the lives and safety of oil industry workers and protect the Gulf fishing industry, or the financial responsibility regulations to avoid oil companies taking shortcuts & passing the risk of mishaps on to taxpayers?

2802 2018-09-12 18:25:45 At least 70% of oil is used for transportation or energy production, i.e. burning it. If we can replace this 70% with renewable energy sources and only use oil as industrial feedstock, the US can easily be self-sufficient and it will take 3 times longer to run out

2839 2018-09-12 18:19:54 Nah, they just get a new arms deal for their pies, we enjoy the ruckus they stir for oil.
2840 2018-09-12 18:19:51 If milk comes from coal, does that mean cookies come from oil?  Is that why we want it so bad?  I feel like we need to finish our cookie pipeline.

2846 2018-09-12 18:19:23 This is the end of #Senegal , look at every African country that has oil..
2847 2018-09-12 18:19:19 So Sanctions start against Iran, the price of oil rises the dollar is relatively cheap and Russia because it trades in dollars will start to make money, too simplistic maybe lol
2848 2018-09-12 18:19:15 Democrats are crying as we speak because we are not reliant on foreign oil.

2855 2018-09-12 18:18:48 I've been hearing alot about the loc (liquid oil cream) method for your hair & how it helps with growth & moisture. any thoughts or recommendations ?
2856 2018-09-12 18:18:35 Sell oil,

If you are buying on hurricane news you should stop. 
There are no refineries of significance in the area. People will actually consume much less in the aftermath.  
There will be a glut of gas built up.

2857 2018-09-12 18:18:29 .@FoxNews (Stephanie Nolasco) "He had ran [sic] away from home and found employment as a gardener on oil billionaire J. Paul Getty’s estate, which was located nearby."
2858 2018-09-12 18:18:11 Have you gotten your three servings of coconut oil today? Bonus points if it's sprouted.
2859 2018-09-12 18:18:11 Bill C-69 will give any fringe group an effective veto against not only pipelines, but any oil, gas, mining and forestry operation.
I'm sure Andy knows he's personally doing fine.
For the rest of us it's a different story.
2860 2018-09-12 18:18:08 Of course, the Lagos - Calabar rail project has entered voice mail. The "owners of Nigeria" are focusing on "relevant" rail projects, refineries in Niger Republic and searching for oil in Gongola Basin.

If you like, be criminally stupid, don't understand how Nigeria works.
2861 2018-09-12 18:18:05 Peppermint and tea tree essential oil (diluted of course in ur choreograph carrier oil, preferably light weight) plus scalp massager on mildly sprayed(with water) scalp. Don't scratch it.  Massage.

2865 2018-09-12 18:17:36 I don't know about cars but right now my respiratory system feels like how I imagine it is when you start a car and you can tell it's gonna need the oil changed in the next few days but the problem isn't BAD yet
2866 2018-09-12 18:17:34 It’s no fun spending your break getting an oil change. 
2867 2018-09-12 18:17:33 Can i get a FaceTime while I’m getting my oil changed ?
2868 2018-09-12 18:17:19 I’d suggest the oil. You can get it at the beauty supply

2870 2018-09-12 18:16:58 I didn't know this hair oil my sister bought for us was made from cocoa butter so now my hair smells like it and I don't know how to feel
2871 2018-09-12 18:16:56 Have had made by Purple Mustard the last 2 seasons. Excellent quality and using @RockOilNews SOC to remove oil with pressure washer come up like new each time. Recommended

2874 2018-09-12 18:16:33 My 2006 Infinity has 278,000 miles on it.

I just change the oil regularly, and put new tires on it once in awhile.

2876 2018-09-12 18:16:20  The lips of another man's wife may be as sweet as honey and her kisses as smooth as olive oil. But  when it all over, she leaves you nothing but bitterness and pain. She will take you down to the world of the dead, the road she walks is the road to death.
2877 2018-09-12 18:16:10 ChrisFix is literally why I have auto tools at my mom's house (she's got a garage) - Done everything from oil changes to his superflush on my Accent before handing it off to my mom. Even used it as a resource to change an alternator in Texas once!
2878 2018-09-12 18:16:06 How? By being the biggest polluter of the country? The more oil you sell, the more the dollar goes up and the exports go down. BC, Ontario and Quebec lose and the Maritime Provinces lose their workers. VERY GOOD THING PETROLEUM ???

2885 2018-09-12 18:15:10 Does anyone have any remedies for itchy scalp? Mine's driving me nuts. No flakes, no dandruff, nothing. Just itches. I've cleaned with rose water, diluted ACV nothing. Also applied diluted tea tree oil, nothing. 
Please I'll go to a cave in Timbuktu to get ingredients if required
2886 2018-09-12 18:15:08 @AudiUK @whatcar @BBCWatchdog please can someone at Audi honestly justify their servicing prices? Sorry but they are nothing short of a rip-off - over £355 to change the oil? Are you serious!? Dealers seem to have carte blanche to charge what they want.
2887 2018-09-12 18:15:07 I am kind of tired of this. Production over 20 years for both oil and gas have decreased by 70%.  Prices (thus incomes) fluctuate with the oil price. If none of you trust me on this, go research the figures. So far this year, four exploration and five development well drilled.
2888 2018-09-12 18:15:06 someone hella rich touching down. Das dat oil money
2889 2018-09-12 18:15:05 love going to get my oil changed because i know my car is always happy afterwards but i hate waiting :(

2891 2018-09-12 18:14:56 Are you consuming some kind of honey or olive oil??
2892 2018-09-12 18:14:47 Sorry you missed my point which was that your analogy didn’t work for me. Doing an oil change is ALWAYS beneficial to the overall health of your car, whether you have broken lights or not.
2893 2018-09-12 18:14:47 Swallow a clove of garlic with spoon of honey (chew if ya can), oil of oregano pills, lemon ginger ACV black pepper & turmeric tea. Either one or all of these things have nipped bud of sickness from me on multiple occasions.

2901 2018-09-12 18:13:19 expressing yourself with 90s Courtney Cox friends gif on a 2018 twitter political thread defending dirty oil exportation is really a new thing. it’s very funny engaging thanks
2902 2018-09-12 18:13:18 absolute worse! their own company which is likely -ive ROI (most of the oil & gas industry is) and 9 other spec 'for sure' small cap/micro cap plays

2909 2018-09-12 18:12:29 Luckily Russia's economy is about the size of Mexico's. They don't have all that much influence, nukes and RT notwithstanding.

I don't know how much conservation they do, but at least a little would be rational, if only so they could export more oil.

2929 2018-09-12 18:10:15 Nah. I went to look at a van, called the dealer and he said he was driving it back from the MOT station with a fresh ticket. Had one no plate light missing and one inop, and an oil leak dripping >50mm in two minutes. Still dodgy centres out there.

2932 2018-09-12 18:10:01 With imports drying up and oil going up India seems to be facing major inflation. demand is steady but supply drying up along with growth in unemployment. looks similar to US stagflation of the 70s. A populist govt with elections next yr along with anti FDI pressure #UhOh

2949 2018-09-12 18:09:05 I like to daydream about how to improve the world. Like using resources  just sitting around. Instead of building oil pipelines, I'd be curious about a water pipeline that could redistribute water from flood areas to drought. Prolly unrealistic but a fun imaginary exercise.
2950 2018-09-12 18:09:01 I'm done with all my assignments until the weekend and I have one more class today so I think I'm gonna vape CBD oil in the bathroom as a special little treat
2951 2018-09-12 18:08:54 Peppermint oil!! It’s my saving grace. If you don’t have oil try just sucking on peppermint candy. Also works: put your feet in warm water and put an ice pack on your neck.

2968 2018-09-12 18:06:38 People who stay in State House, Living in treasure like Kipchumba Murkomen and Sakaja have no idea what it feels like to live on the other side of the street. They will be all over telling Kenyans to pay additional taxes to get expensive snake oil project like SGR. #JKLive

2975 2018-09-12 18:05:46 Pressure? Already involved in this Mideast history of blood oil from Sudan all the way to Iran. China has its own foreign policy for that region.
2976 2018-09-12 18:05:46 The Reality is there aren't too many horses per capita AS The Corrupt BLM wants us to believe .  Horses are losing all their designated  land to Rich Lobbyists for oil, mining ,cattle ,fracking

2977 2018-09-12 18:05:44 $CPG $CVE $HSE.CA Oil up 2% and oils languish. There has yet to be a melt-up in the E&P's but it's coming if oil marches up

2979 2018-09-12 18:05:29 Fyi,
A year ago, it was feared my many market experts^ that the fall in Crude Oil price from US$ 140/ to $35/ would turn from the lows and again peak to $90/.

Anyone who could be so enamoured by Yashwant Sinha  should give him a job with their paper/portal.

2980 2018-09-12 18:05:25 the US has been importing almost all of its oil from the western hemisphere for years. Canada, mexico, and venezuela. 
Horrible fascist dictator in canada there eh?
2981 2018-09-12 18:05:21 YES BILL C69!
Protect Canadian interests, don't lay out the red carpet for foreign oil companies.

Nationalize our oil, let's put Canadians First!!!!!
2982 2018-09-12 18:05:13 I'd like this recipe better with fewer grams of carbs and sugars. Homemade Italian dressing, (made with olive oil and organic vinegar or lemon juice,) might make the difference.
2983 2018-09-12 18:04:46 I live in a very kippy Brexitty area, I know about the strong but rarely rational emotions of some leavers. But they are a minority of leavers, though maybe as much as half. The others when they realise that they've been sold snake oil by fraudsters will play safe and back remain
2984 2018-09-12 18:04:42 I just accidentally cooked chilli halloumi in chilli oil and added it to a chilli chicken in a salad topped with jalapeños. Will now have heartburn and a runny nose for three weeks. Marvellous.

2989 2018-09-12 18:04:30 Stop by Perry Automotive Inc. today and tomorrow in Elkhart and get your oil changed! You can also call and get a gift card for an oil change!
2990 2018-09-12 18:04:24 That is always good to hear bro. Making more and more money. Hopefully that heat pump and oil change will not cost you too much to get done.

2993 2018-09-12 18:03:54 Watch the film it’s very interesting. I sometimes wonder by letting say 1000 Americans die (guessing). That then gives them a reason to wage war and take control of an oil region. I don’t know if I believe it or not but nothing would surprise me with the Deep State
2994 2018-09-12 18:03:46 Most face washes dry the skin which then causes your body to over produce oil to keep hydrated

3001 2018-09-12 18:03:02 Its okay... I had to leave for just a few minutes to get an oil change quick!!!
3002 2018-09-12 18:02:54 We are a super power. In 50 years when all that oil is gone, we'll still be here.
3003 2018-09-12 18:02:53 I really want to do a cherub×bts oil painting but idk how to synthesize the two :(

3005 2018-09-12 18:02:45 Did you not see yesterday about the price of oil.
Did you read the 2014 White Paper.
I did and it was heavy reading. Oil was to be our’back up’ at that time oil prices were high. They plummeted as you will know.Tbh the WP was full of supposition and oil was at it root.

3009 2018-09-12 18:02:09 This crude rally is a reaction to Iran crude export dropping by 30%, imagine what will happen when export to the EU drop to zero (it’s possible). By the way, Saudi Arabia already pumping record volume of oil to the market.
3010 2018-09-12 18:02:02 Good piece but was surprised to see no mention of the ongoing campaign by enviros to push for action *today*, like halting permitting of oil wells.
3011 2018-09-12 18:02:01 To eliminate all risk posed by a hurricane would require an individual to travel entirely away from any potential storm effects. High winds, heavy rain, and even tornadoes spawned by the hurricane can put people at risk far from the coast.
3012 2018-09-12 18:01:57 Agree Heid. Just hope they can sort out what went wrong last time. Well integrity was obviously a problem and despite the side track didn't resolve the issues. Clearly so much oil with natural fractures, difficult to get stable tubing

3014 2018-09-12 18:01:46 I’m sure Crimea thought the same.  

I would not put it past trump to sell them to Russia. 

Russia is setting up settlements buying up shipping companies and ports up and down the Alaskan coast and buying oil field with this lobbyist help. But America first.

3070 2018-09-12 17:55:53 In this politically charged time & with govt's leaning liberal oil Co's have to say that to some extent & they may be doing some research.  I don't oppose research.

Industry studies estimate we currently have 200 years of reachable oil reserves- ~based on current technology~
3071 2018-09-12 17:55:51 I would how much  Trump has been promised if he opened up the pipeline. Trump is a scumbag and this pipeline is not needed.

Current US sanctions on Iran are unlikely to stop Iranian oil exports completely, a long-time adviser at Saudi Arabia’s Energy Ministry said on Tuesday, adding Iran would be unable to close the straits of Hormuz and Bab Al Mandeb even partially.
3081 2018-09-12 17:55:05 Y’all really out here stanning for oil and gas while tax cuts to your industry bankrupted our state? Y’all really have the gall to say it’s other people’s financial management and not your dragonlike hoarding of our state’s resources so Harold Hamm can swim in gold?

3085 2018-09-12 17:54:20 Trump also did not travel to Canada 6 plus times to do panels, give speeches and do photo ops with Trudeau agitators like Kenney or Wall. Multiple times traipsing across the US without touching base with their leader. Trump should go do tours of the oil sands and car plant.

3091 2018-09-12 17:53:50 Yes, because power generation from oil and gas is cheaper for now as compared to RE sources. Its cost about $0.5cent to generate a kilowatt from oil/gas fired power station.

3118 2018-09-12 17:51:30 You forget the mountain of debt that the UPA created to subsidise the fuel prices. The 1.4 lakh crore oil bonds nearly wrecked the economy. Please continue your slavishness to the dynasty, and leave the economic thinking to people who have the capacity

You have fresh tomatoes, basil, olive oil, garlic and maybe one or two extras.  The more you add the less authentic it gets.

3125 2018-09-12 17:50:36 worst of the worst is working in the oil & gas industry and being all in on 10 different oil stocks, see it all the time ... that's correlation you do not want !!
3126 2018-09-12 17:50:27 I hate being a woman in an auto repair shop.

All I *need* is an oil change and tire rotation. And this dude tries to play cute & tell me I’m “shooting him down” [this isn’t a date] by telling him I don’t want the over $800 of repairs he’s trying to sell me.

3134 2018-09-12 17:49:37 It tasted and had a mouthfeel almost indistinguishable from how the coffee would have been without the coconut oil, I think because I used an electric frother I already had lying around that was going unused.

3247 2018-09-12 17:39:18 I replace salt in recipes with minced anchovies in olive oil. Then have some herring, kippers, mackerel, tinned wild salmon or sardines a day or 2 a week.
3248 2018-09-12 17:39:16 OK, Jimmy Carter once famously thought we would run out of oil too

You're not the first

Who knew technology would find a new way to extract oil & natural gas?  

Solar & Wind have proved unreliable due to weather patterns & seasonality. They don't work without govt subsidies
3249 2018-09-12 17:39:02 I just paid 47 freaking 50 for an oil change.  @TerribleHerbst more like terrible price.
3250 2018-09-12 17:38:59 My uncle just told me that oil will soon finish, that I will chop that petroleum engineering I'm studying in school

3254 2018-09-12 17:38:44 The interest rates are unfairly high, often countries reimburse debt in assets such as cobalt or oil.

3258 2018-09-12 17:38:03 Make a hair mask with avocado and olive oil or mayonnaise and egg. Last option smells horrible but it works. I also started using players hair softener moisturizer. My hair been behaving since I started using it
3259 2018-09-12 17:37:45 More polite than being covered by boiling oil
3260 2018-09-12 17:37:42 #ParliFuelDebate The ANC's Fikile Majola says the fuel price has got to be looked at within the global economy and the price of oil

3262 2018-09-12 17:37:32 If you aren't a fan of vegetables try them raw with a dressing, roasted in the oven with olive oil or on the grill with a little salt and pepper...and if all those are out you could always start your day with a green drink like I do ;)
3263 2018-09-12 17:37:32 Good news for Venezuela. They better hurry up. With massive bulliyng from the US+world allies, to hurt Venezuela's PDVSA oil economy, every barrel counts. Sooner or later more and more people in the world will sum up to help the TRUTH about Venezuela being attack 7x24x365xalways
3264 2018-09-12 17:37:21 Worldwide we see only indigenous people of Biafra defending Human Rights /Self Determination
Terrorist are Boko Haram always free. 
Without oil and gas of the richiest land IPOB , We are no Police, no talk about terrorism, all greedy are there 
The world we are looking for IPOB
3265 2018-09-12 17:37:15 Oil reserves are all depleting world over, just watch one busy cross road over an hour & count the vehicles which waste petrol/ gas... think thereafter - if the govt is using to push that we all need to adopt austerity - high prices are a good deterrent
3266 2018-09-12 17:37:08 Oil price is notoriously difficult to predict.  Be skeptical of the experts but expect volatility and higher pump prices
3267 2018-09-12 17:36:52 Yeah.  Gd doesn't need a marketing director. He is the real deal, and most people, young and old are smart enough to realize that if the want to serve themselves instead of Gd, they are more expert than some snake oil salesman selling bottles of self justification.

3279 2018-09-12 17:34:51 I did. Outright attacking Syria, sending heavy weapons to the rebels in Crimea, pulling out of the Iran deal, undermining their oil sales with Germany, etc. These are things no president since Reagan has been willing to do, because they hurt or relationship with Russia.

3281 2018-09-12 17:34:07 I almost missed my connection but I spent my first flight playing peekaboo with an adorable baby in front of me and the lady next to me put some lavender essential oil on my wrists so it’s a good day so far.
3282 2018-09-12 17:34:03 So why is Canada buying Saudi oil?
3283 2018-09-12 17:33:53 If you don’t pronounce it oil you’re dumb.
3284 2018-09-12 17:33:49 Without oil Scotland is STILL a thriving developed western economy - don’t agree with me - go check for yourself. Try not to use emotionally glib terms like “stronger” & “together” it’s an utterly meaningless phrase- in practice Scotland is disabled in this unreformable deal

3301 2018-09-12 17:31:35 no, its sold as meat , dog food and apparently they have frozen stockpiles.  They are the sole customer of icelands whaling. Iceland dont even eat it anymore. 3500 stores in japan dropped whale meat.  No idea where they get oil , they have nuclear as we all know #Fukushima
3302 2018-09-12 17:31:22 Some drops of apple cider vinegar and hot compress. Or you can do tea tree oil or hydrogen peroxide

3308 2018-09-12 17:31:01 When it comes to roasting vegetables, simplicity is key. In the Rectangular Roaster, toss any root vegetable with olive oil, sea salt, shallots, and fresh herbs. Roast at 400 °F / 200 °C, tossing occasionally and voila!
3309 2018-09-12 17:30:58 *Whisper*

Between you and me, I would probably struggle to function in modern society without the benefit of CBD oil. Hahahaha!

Not that I would know anything about that! Good thing this isn't a modern society.

3381 2018-09-12 17:22:03 There's a great scene in #Anthropocene at #TIFF18 of a sea wall being built in China to protect an oil field from rising sea levels. They don't spell it out for us - they just show it.

Use This Oil Outside
3386 2018-09-12 17:21:22 Made these last week and they’re delicious. Only tweak I’d make is not tipping in all the oil from the sardines at once because they were a little sloppy - or maybe that’s because I was too impatient to chill them before cooking!

3393 2018-09-12 17:20:11 Guess you don't have an answer for why eastern Canada isn't supplied with Nfld oil. Instead you lamely attempt to shame Canadian for the unethical choices of a private industry and then play some imagined victim card.

Worthless.

3406 2018-09-12 17:18:51 Yes oil bonds could be one of the reason, but why there is decline in FOREX reserves with RBI. Returns earned from project are very minimal and it takes lot's of time as well.

3418 2018-09-12 17:17:21  you right *hasnt had an oil change in a while... still goes* 
3419 2018-09-12 17:17:19 Here we go with another once-in-a-lifetime storm and climate change deniers already started protecting their precious oil industry. Good thing we have Science to track the path and minimize loss of life. About time to sweep the anti-science pols out of office. They are dangerous.
3420 2018-09-12 17:17:19 And smoke more weed (CBD oil if you really have to be productive;)
3421 2018-09-12 17:17:13 Hahaha jobs didn’t rise towards the end of obama. So didn’t start blowing. Bubbles up your butt because you think he didn’t this. He didn’t do crap but put more Americans on welfare. Destroyed more job. And so what if someone works in the oil and gas side. It is a job.
3422 2018-09-12 17:17:09 Go and fight their war for them.  That's not the USA's war.  It's not our obligation.  They have access to banks and oil.  All they have to do is figure out how to not continue to vote in commies who nationalize companies owned by foreign nationals. Collective IQ = 84 +-.
3423 2018-09-12 17:17:08 Why are hurricanes intensifying year after year? If only there were some scientific explanation for this. Oh well. *drinks oil*

3444 2018-09-12 17:14:29 The mechanic who is changing my oil just had a discussion with me about Harry Potter and how we get sorted into are respective houses in every test we take, lol.
3445 2018-09-12 17:14:29 Oil has made us a weak economy. After India achieves energy Independence through electrical vehicles, solar and wind power what will we import? Almost nothing. We have everything. Hence, before industrial revolution we were the richest place in world.
3446 2018-09-12 17:14:25 He was a lawyer for one of the oil companies. That's exactly how he knows what goes on. 

If you listen to the podcast he goes into detail about how green organisations collude WITH oil companies behind closed doors.

It's all a scam. And the loser is tax payers. Wake up.

3456 2018-09-12 17:13:11 The local car check-up place made pretty much the same joke, only it was for oil changes instead of eye exams.
3457 2018-09-12 17:13:10 So I’m getting my sandwich made and the guy is putting oil and vinegar on it. And i told him to go easy because “i don’t like for it to get too wet before I can eat it”.  

Then I blurted out “THAT’S WHAT SHE SAID”. .  So that’s been my Wednesday.

3461 2018-09-12 17:12:41 TWELVE WHAT?! For some OIL? What you drive, a Rocket Pack?
3462 2018-09-12 17:12:38 It actually starts from within. Buy flax seeds; so lacking in our diets. Eat them regularly. There’s oil, too you can use on salads, etc.

3468 2018-09-12 17:11:49 There are too many moving parts to predict when it’s going to bounce back. We have oil prices, CBN reaction to interest rates, inflation, US interest rates, foreign investor’s appetite...

I can only talk about now, not six months. I only surf the waves as events hit.
3469 2018-09-12 17:11:38 "About 28% of EU oil imports come from Russia, which is eager to undermine the dollar’s dominance. Invoicing these supplies in a currency other than the dollar should be feasible, and it would put pressure on other suppliers to shift as well."
3470 2018-09-12 17:11:30 So when are retail prices coming down? Soon? Why does big oil contunue to make billions on the backs of consumers?
3471 2018-09-12 17:11:29 Alright guys. Time to clean up the mess from the first game.
May not be much to be playing for. But fans expect you at your best. They deserve that. Good luck. The Flames need the Oil. Win or Lose, make it worth it for the fans.

3472 2018-09-12 17:11:27 Lots of companies can mine oil are they as successful as the big ones no? Your point? #bitcoin has the same mining algorithm and miners, it's just the production pipe line is restricted to one barrel of oil per 10mins . #bch can produce 32 barrels in the same time frame.

3478 2018-09-12 17:10:43 Yeah, it would’ve had to.  I think in the picture of the pentagon & the plane, the measurements do not compare.  It would’ve made much more sense if someone would compare apples to apples.  I wonder who did the meme & why they wanted to fooling ppl?

3481 2018-09-12 17:10:34 I would recommend.  However, it is big and heavy.
The one I got is 17 litres (not 1.7 as title says), with 5L extender, oil squirter, 2 baskets, 2 different height wire racks and an odd but functional set of tongs for lifting out baskets/racks.  All packs away inside after use.
3482 2018-09-12 17:10:34 1. Mayo on fries is delicious.

2. But you need good mayo. Hellmann's is commercial bread moistener. Try Kewpie Mayo.

4. Baby Jesus' undeveloped digestive tract is not yet able able to process the oil, which is what's making Him cry. Don't confuse correlation with causation.
3483 2018-09-12 17:10:27 Well exactly, yes!

Makes me think of the #Oil Stabilization Fund in #Iran, which was raided during the @Ahmadinejad1956 presidency & during “good times” (when oil prices were rising) & was rendered ineffective as an instrument of stabilization when oil prices collapsed in 2009.
3484 2018-09-12 17:10:25 Currently at the car shop to get an oil change and a worker with a huge grey beard & a million tats said I have cool tattoos. Almost cried.

Hence why he wants all to stay in our cars

3511 2018-09-12 17:07:35 Perception in North Dakota, where I traveled recently, is that renewables industry is hostile to unions. Hence, organized labor stays allied w #fossilfuels. Have heard the same here in NYS re: solar industry. Oil/gas propaganda or true story? What are you hearing, Marg?
3512 2018-09-12 17:07:32 Yeah sir, that was totally incorrect. @sambitswaraj has alrdy accepted on National TV that Modi ji unke baap hain. To wo aapka beta kaise ho  sakta hai. Aap thoda na ek Doctor ko Oil company ka Director bana sakte ho. Naa..To fit aapka beta kaise
3513 2018-09-12 17:07:21 Your needlework is astounding! Artistically [colored pencil, and oil paints artist here], of course it's hard to let go. Unless it's those doing "shlock-stuff", a piece of your heart and soul goes with each piece sold! A piece honoring your brother would be doubly hard to see go.

3538 2018-09-12 17:04:36 under-recoveries had to be paid off right.. subsidizing oil is not good economics keeping the fiscal deficit in mind.. I agree with the argument that there needs to be some kind of reduction in excise duty but at this juncture they may not do that citing fiscal prudence.

3554 2018-09-12 17:03:06 No crash yet. Trump allowing up to 90% of his own offshore oil rigs to explore (maybe they found something) will help their economy. More jobs, importer becomes exporter.  Saudis go.......

I am happy with it, but stuff doesn't taste the same with less oil, but at least it's healthier, and I think cheaper as I'm not heating an entire oven.

Also we should also started exploring our oil reserves

3570 2018-09-12 17:01:07 Thanks. I did see those earlier today but put off by their note about possible difficulties getting them into UK. I bought a dwarf black oil type from Ebay from a UK seller - not organic but not F1. But sunflowers everywhere on the allotments so maybe mine will just cross too!
3571 2018-09-12 17:01:05 There's actually more than two, unfortunately.  Too many state agencies have a say.  And I'm sure they've all got the NGOs and politicians in their ears (which means the oil and gas co's too).

Loosely using the word loot.

I have seen no change in the rail system since privatization in fact it has got worse. Ave rail journey 27mph

3778 2018-09-12 16:37:27 The case of Nigeria is a lost glory. Until we embrace agriculture and be less dependent on the oil sector, agriculture is gonna remain traditional... 
Why?
*Right policies are not in place
*No form of encouragement
*poor infrastructure

3779 2018-09-12 16:37:26 What about that 2Lakh Crore oil bond that NDA govt paid if I am not wrong.
3780 2018-09-12 16:37:23 Portable phone chargers are allowed. If you call and ask to talk to someone at Lucas oil stadium take down their name. Because they aren't supposed to be giving solid answers. One of my friends talked to the head of guest services named Pattie. Pattie said they ARE ALLOWED
3781 2018-09-12 16:37:12 When you can not digest those vanity, it is easy to encounter difficulties. So don't focus on eating oil. Focus on how to quickly learn a lot to understand and solve various domestic problems. Try to adjust the problem of high heart. This humble is your life.
3782 2018-09-12 16:37:07 I would abhor any attempt to add/ detract/ change/ anything from the Classic dosai. It's a purist way of thinking, I know, rather inflexible, but there nevertheless. Dosa off a tava, pudi with virgin Olive oil, Fresh coconut chutney, a nutty urad/ tomato/onion chutney, Coffee. 
3783 2018-09-12 16:37:04 When crude oil price was US$ 107 pbl, petrol price in India during UPA period was Rs. 71.41 per liter.  But when crude price is US$ 71 pbl, petrol price now during NDA period is Rs. 80.73 per liter.  Achche din?

3795 2018-09-12 16:35:52 which led Ceaușescu to embark on an ambitious plan to invest heavily in oil-refining plants. Ceaușescu's plan was to make Romania into Europe's number one oil refiner not only of its oil, but also of oil from Middle Eastern states like Iraq and Iran...
3796 2018-09-12 16:35:46 When you're cooking a steak and you accidentally splash hot oil on yourself, and you have to make the split second decision between rinsing it off or achieving the perfect medium rare. Needless to say, I may have scars now.

3798 2018-09-12 16:35:28 My dad owned a gas/service station for over 30 years. Oil companies charge what they like, when they like.
3799 2018-09-12 16:35:28 I didn’t realize the American economy is entirely dependent on oil exports.

You must be young, when you have a lot of opportunities to eat oil, when shining, many people will pay attention to you, then you must be careful to become high-hearted.

3801 2018-09-12 16:35:13 Starting with the 1973–74 Arab oil embargo against the West, a period of prolonged high oil prices set in that characterised the rest of the 1970s. Romania as a major oil producer greatly benefited from the high oil prices of the 1970s ...
3802 2018-09-12 16:35:00 @moseskuria should know more than this. Don't just think of it as 'tax.' There's more to it. Because the production process and value addition on consumables begins with the fuel/oil that the machines run on, transportation etc. The cost of living rises as a consequence.

3809 2018-09-12 16:33:41 @IllRockAFella must suck to have Roosevelt break up your so called “oil company” into 34 other companies 
3810 2018-09-12 16:33:38 Agree and the oil extracted from the deserts today is testimony to a prodigious past for biodiversity in some Mesozoic periods. With much more CO2 plant food. Magnetosphere 3x stronger 100 millions yrs ago.

3827 2018-09-12 16:32:02 Since the American people are so easily misled by snake oil salesmen like DJT, Fox News opinion hosts, white supremacists propaganda, Russian hackers, etc. maybe we should have a gold standard panel of award winning journalist and editors that fact check major stories.

3832 2018-09-12 16:31:35 Oil and gas are global commodity markets, domestic deregulation has no effect on prices. If anything it would lower prices due to increasing supply, but the effect would be negligible. You don't have actual facts to back up your position, just a feeling he is 'pro rural'

3843 2018-09-12 16:30:36 Fearless prediction:  Oil / Energy exploration has become a dirty word among governments and investment funds.  Conversely this could contribute to a huge shortage,  as exploration is way behind the curve.  
A spike to 100 + is not priced at all.  Much more likely than believed.

3911 2018-09-12 16:23:06 California just enacted #SB100 California will be on green energy by 2045 this will change oil and gas markets and make sustainable green energy happen even sooner thank you @JerryBrownGov put the word out @Thom_Hartmann @ericgarcetti @elonmusk @atDavidHoffman @Davidlaz
3912 2018-09-12 16:22:59 most of World oil/gas suppliers have huge problems with wars, sanctions, islamist militants, ISIL (and sponsors) etc., so strange... Are we aiming to have only a handful of "friends" in the business?! may be just coincidence #Iran #SaudiArabia #libia #Venezuela #Syria #Irak
3913 2018-09-12 16:22:58 Came to the dealership for a oil change. I’m dodging the salesman that called me yesterday trying to buy my truck back and put me in a new one lol. Nahhhh playa I’m goody

3915 2018-09-12 16:22:55 Paspusha Rocket ICO is the latest technology to destroy oil refineries  residues around the world. Instead of destroying flora and fauna,  refineries get gasoline and diesel fuel for selling. #Papusha #ICO #Crowdsale #Bitcoin #Blockchain #Token #ETH #Ethereum #TokenSale

3919 2018-09-12 16:22:38 And guess what will happen in British Columbia around the oil and coal terminals when we get “the big one”?
3920 2018-09-12 16:22:35 Coconut oil is a lifesaver for adding moisture back to bleached hair (I bleached mine 4 times when I dip-dyed it) - whack it in, leave it for a few hours and then rise it out :)
3921 2018-09-12 16:22:31 No gay shit but i wanna see so i can tell you if you need to just get it redone lmao . But maybe some oil n water and patience with a small eyebrow ring from the hair store
3922 2018-09-12 16:22:29 Rise in oil prices did not force public to shift to pooling nor there was overloading of public transport. It means every one has surplus cash to bear the cost.
3923 2018-09-12 16:22:24 The @EPA has announced that it plans to roll back its rules on #methane leaks from oil and gas production. The relaxed rules will result in more methane being released into the atmosphere. Methane is a 25x more significant contributor to #climatechange than CO2.
3924 2018-09-12 16:22:21 We have to move away from producing and consuming palm oil since it’s extremely detrimental to the vitality and health of our ecosystems.......
3925 2018-09-12 16:22:15 yes but the sprouts and OIL counter the filth of the broccoli (and I don't mind the stems as much as the bobbly weirdness at the end)

3927 2018-09-12 16:22:12 Our fresh take on French toast: day-old beet brioche hand-dipped in a blend of vanilla-infused platypus egg yolks and fermented yak milk, deep-fried in illegally harvested palm oil; topped with maple sugar butter-dust. 
3928 2018-09-12 16:22:09 And...continues its greedy, science denying, big oil/coal/chem/gas purchased poisonous policies that add to climate change, thereby increasing the size and frequency of storms like #Florence #HurricaneFlorence2018
3929 2018-09-12 16:22:04 @HARRISFAULKNER  Barack Obama has been criticized for continuing to play golf while oil spills into the Gulf of Mexico.He has played at least seven times since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20, creating America’s biggest environmental disaster.
3930 2018-09-12 16:21:55 The Venn diagram of industries people complain about market failures and industries with a lot of government intervention is a circle, or maybe to be generous a circle when you’re drunk. 
Medicine, finance, housing development, oil, etc.

3933 2018-09-12 16:21:49 @jimrome hating on Matt Patricia solidifies VanSmax’s jealously of that beard.
Romey can’t grow facial hair of that quality or volume.
If he could it would be dripping with hair products to include Just for Men, AXE Total Body Scrub with a finishing touch of pube trimmer oil.
3934 2018-09-12 16:21:33 Ahi tuna steak - season with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper, Pan seer in olive oil over medium heat for 3 minutes on each side, serve with soy sauce on the side. You’re welcome
3935 2018-09-12 16:21:22 Crude oil jumps on big drop in U.S. stockpiles, hurricane fears
3936 2018-09-12 16:21:15 Lavender essential oil definitely works for me! + Lush Sleepy... pero kung ayaw mo rin talaga matulog, di talaga gagana hehe haha
3937 2018-09-12 16:21:11 Freshly squeezed lemon juice, half the zest, olive oil, mixed herbs, touch of garlic, salt & pepper.
Also makes a great salad dressing.

3940 2018-09-12 16:20:57 Comment if you know this funny country

4G no network.
Oil producing country but import fuel.
Supplier of light to other countries but have no light.
Senators job; fight, dance n eat money.
Full of rich people but yet poor. 
Have police officers that robs citizens...

3941 2018-09-12 16:20:50 Show us the oil that came out...........
3942 2018-09-12 16:20:45 Getting an oil change seems like an eternity when the bitch in the waiting area is watching murder videos without headphones.
3943 2018-09-12 16:20:43 Be carful of being accused of hording millions in off shore accounts, shares in oil etc.. by the daft trolls that infest SM.

3947 2018-09-12 16:20:33 What is a shame are the millions of people who are living out their lives  they believe is the Right, even if not always Good Way - while officials pump oil, instead of water, plant kisses on a mascot, instead of crops, say THEY are "swamped" by THEIR service.

3948 2018-09-12 16:20:31 Great question!  Heat a little bit of oil in a fry pan and sear both sides of the London broil, then move to a preheated oven to 325-350 degrees F, for approx. 40 mins. Make a nice au jus, or gravy, and serve with rice, potatoes, or other starch of your choice! Yummy!

3950 2018-09-12 16:20:13 How's that oil resources thing going? Lol. So, they went into the Middle East, blew it up, blocked challenges to the US dollar, and destabilized Europe...but forgot about the oil? Lol.

3953 2018-09-12 16:20:03 Heheheh oil well
3954 2018-09-12 16:20:02 Read some facts not green propaganda.
Greens: oil will run out in 20 years must stop burning fossil fuels.
...but with fracking oil will last 400 years!
Greens: sh*t, now we'll have to discredit fracking. I know let's say if caused earthquakes, and we can fake burning tap water
3955 2018-09-12 16:20:01 Practicing for the invasion of the mideast to take over world's supply if oil. Mark my word!

3957 2018-09-12 16:19:29 Wrong analysis. Those who sweet in peace don’t bleed in war. He did nothing when oil price low . China has public transport in electricity
3958 2018-09-12 16:19:25 PSA: Y’all Girls Game Be Weak Af... But Let Y’all Tell It It’s Oil!
3959 2018-09-12 16:19:17 Please, everyone be safe where Hurricane Florence is concerned. Expect delays in Oil Creek Originals pattern shipments the next week or so. Electronic orders shouldn’t be subject to delay... unless power is out.
3960 2018-09-12 16:19:17 You do know that Alberta is sorta the Texas of Canada?  Awesome locale for post-apocalyptic world ... oil pools on the land ... giant steers fighting giant truck-a-saurii ... can’t wait!
3961 2018-09-12 16:19:12 If they had to cut into their own dividends to pay a tax, then it’s income. But the oil companies give money to Alaskans, it’s is a dividend not an income. That’s why I can’t watch FOX.

3965 2018-09-12 16:18:42 Caffeine, vitamin D, B12, vitamin E, flaxseed oil. I only took the vitamin D because I kept flunking my lab results. It fixed it. Took the flaxseed on my internists recommendation and my cholesterol dropped significantly. I don’t work out so I don’t know about the other stuff HGH
3966 2018-09-12 16:18:40 Cierto
3967 2018-09-12 16:18:34 Obviously the waves will rise to 40 feet and the oil and gas workers will be stranded.  All because of Brexit.

3969 2018-09-12 16:17:50 Actually DHS owns the patent on CBD oil back from 2003. They also have a patent recognizing medicinal benefits from 2015.
3970 2018-09-12 16:17:36 Thank you... I don't know anyone who has done a mint selection so I thought I would create my own. I infused my buttercream with peppermint oil and they are all on chocolate buns. 
3971 2018-09-12 16:17:28 I had no other option but to do my oil change @ Walmart im not so religious but please, pray for me.
3972 2018-09-12 16:17:25 my chicago depression meal is giardieniera straight out the jar and then spit out the extra oil in the sink
3973 2018-09-12 16:17:13 Barrels of oil was trading at the highs and that was very expensive to manage 2 wars and tax revenue was the answer
3974 2018-09-12 16:17:12 because neolithic man had access to sunflower oil, cereal and pop tarts.    Our very existence substantiates the ingestion of real food
3975 2018-09-12 16:17:11 "We" are not dependent on anything.  Canada is a net exporter of oil by a factor of 400%
Your unethical greedy friends in the oil industry buy Saudi oil because it is cheaper. They could buy from Nfld. Why don't they?
3976 2018-09-12 16:17:07 Coconut oil bro

3978 2018-09-12 16:17:03 "There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up."

"Precious treasure and oil are in a wise man’s dwelling, but a foolish man devours it."
3979 2018-09-12 16:16:53 The good thing about it is it will not fill you house with the oily odour and the food is ready to eat so you don't have to wait for the oil to drip off. If I have a complaint about it, is its as noisy as f*ck! But you're get used to the din after a while!
3980 2018-09-12 16:16:46 Check your Engine oil today.

3990 2018-09-12 16:16:29 See americans dont know our politics. Koch brothers, oil, postmedia, and scheer plans on moving israeli capital like trump. Trump was paid by israel and I think scheer was too. the same thing that happened in the US is happening here. new norms, media control, racist division.
3991 2018-09-12 16:16:29 Study 5:1 He calls the land of Israel a horn, because it is higher than all lands; as the horn is higher than the whole body; and the son of oil, because it is said to be a land flowing with milk and honey.” - Kimchi on the place.
3992 2018-09-12 16:16:25 Thank you for this. You caught my attention the second you talked about coconut oil. I don’t know why anyone recommends coconut oil on the face.

3998 2018-09-12 16:16:11 He resigned for a reason too - because Blair had been proven to have lied on Iraq and got hundreds of thousands of people killed for nothing except profits for Halliburton, arms companies and pals and BP-Amoco an oil contract in Iraq.

4000 2018-09-12 16:15:29 Every time I wash my hair, I deep condition it with Greek yogurt. Honey. A few drops of Argan oil. And olive oil. Protein treatments as needed, typically once a month. And I keep low-maintenance styling.
4001 2018-09-12 16:15:29 Yes. See I live in Los Angeles but this is my home. As much as I hate this administration, the people aren’t to blame. Most of them have never left. They can’t know anything more than they’ve experienced. They got sold snake oil by a snake oil salesman. Not the time to blame them
4002 2018-09-12 16:15:26 Study 5:1  In a very fruitful hill “On a high and fruitful hill” - Hebrew בקרן בן שמן bekeren ben shamen, “on a horn the son of oil.” The expression is highly descriptive and poetical.
4003 2018-09-12 16:15:25 Yes! Roasted cauliflower is actually very good. I do: avocado oil, minced garlic, soy sauce and a bit of balsamic.

4005 2018-09-12 16:15:22 The M7.8 #ShakeOut earthquake scenario shows ~14 FEET of ground offset along the San Andreas at Cajon Pass. This will sever the 15 fwy, 2 major railroads, 3 major elec. lines, 3 major oil pipelines, & 1 of 3 fiber-optic lines supplying internet service to SoCal. #scecmeet
4006 2018-09-12 16:15:20 Possibly but Canada would win that case for certain because its illegal to tie govt hands on new facts.

4016 2018-09-12 16:14:27 Oil crowd is talking blend wall again. Comical. They cry foul and at the same time they are fighting E15, enforcing restrictions at retail on higher blends, and have blockades at terminals. #ethanol

4019 2018-09-12 16:13:54 Price of oil been rising pretty much since 2001 (except 14/15). Trend very much upward and forecast to continue rising. Why is Venezuela broke? Surely a model socialist government could manage corruption. They should be loaded
4020 2018-09-12 16:13:43 2/2 Its basically a sealed pot that you would put the food into lets say a bag of chips, and you will pour over 2 tablespoons of oil & from my lay knowledge once you turn it on it becomes so hot that the oil will become gaseous and steam-fry the food, so it looks and feels fried!

4041 2018-09-12 16:11:32 Managed to burn my left bicep and forearm with oil in work today, agony but I heard a man in the next room in the hospital get a rectal exam and I have never heard such an awkward conversation in my entire life.
4042 2018-09-12 16:11:29 He didn’t say he would oppose drilling 100+ mi. closer to FL, which is Big Oil’s goal. He’s a climate denier with the usual “I support funding for” x compromised glades projects, said a thousand times before. He says racist things. He will get zero environmental votes.
4043 2018-09-12 16:11:25 I use dark angels because I have oily skin and I’m a bit more acne prone. It’s a nice charcoal scrub with a little tea tree oil and a it’s very gentle to use to clean your face in the morning and the evening. Also their tea tree water is great if you want a light toner! 
4044 2018-09-12 16:11:23 I have people coming over and there's part of me that feels I "should" wash up... then there's part of me that feels like I estimated my dose of CBD oil wrong.
4045 2018-09-12 16:11:17 I think we should start naming hurricanes after underlying causes and their variations: Hurricane Clean Coal, Oil, Methane, Off-Shore Drilling, Pipeline, etc.
4046 2018-09-12 16:11:16 Expanding oil decreases their market share leading to massive debts and crushes them long term

4048 2018-09-12 16:10:57 I’m about to see if it’s Jamaican store around here it’s prolly oil
4049 2018-09-12 16:10:52 Had you read the last  goehring&Rozencwajg analysis from oil?
They have a different opinion
@Go_Rozen
4050 2018-09-12 16:10:42 and be consistent on keeping “good oil” on your face. if your face is dry, it’ll release natural oil, which is bad, and causes you to break out. so if your face is dry, i suggest moisturizers with natural oil in it.

birth control helps. u might get a few pimples at first though

4054 2018-09-12 16:10:19 Have you tried rosehip oil or jojoba? I can’t live without them or my vitamins. I take a gazillion.  Natural oils are less expensive and don’t have all of the added chemicals in them. I used to work in the cosmetics business and would never use that stuff again.
4055 2018-09-12 16:10:15 おやすみなさい(-_-)zzz

4058 2018-09-12 16:10:07 The only detail you’re missing is that this guy makes his money selling olive oil to misogynists, so he doesn’t care that normal people despise him as long as he keeps moving product & pulling in cash. It’s a weird niche, but it seems to be working for him. #PerformativeHate

4060 2018-09-12 16:10:01 As it stands, our nation's landfills are overflowing while our oil reserves are rapidly depleting.
4061 2018-09-12 16:09:56 ILook at this...."In the 1960’s before oil took off Nigeria was heavily dependent on Agriculture. Oil contributed 0.6% while Agric was 67%. By 1974 Oil contributed 45% while Agric had slumped to 23%" We need to go back to that era I guess
4062 2018-09-12 16:09:53 You know Fall is officially here when your jar of coconut oil in the bathroom is solid.
4063 2018-09-12 16:09:51 Just seeing this now, once you get an Air Fryer you won't use the other kind again, it is brilliant! I have a TEFAL one that is a year old, replacing the previous model that I had for 4 years. In a round about way it works like a deep fryer but without the need of tons of oil 1/2
4064 2018-09-12 16:09:50 Is the “bioidentical hormone” craze based on anything resembling valuable science? Or is it all snake oil mumbo jumbo?
4065 2018-09-12 16:09:47 That’s in correct roger tamraz was the best option but Eddie Davis wouldn’t sell you a none uk buyer and he was an oil tycoon so that bollocks. Eddie didn’t want his legacy bettered !
4066 2018-09-12 16:09:40 Hehehehe   Nba No!
4067 2018-09-12 16:09:15 That was because they were in government. That’s how democracy works. Governments govern, oppositions oppose. But hey, they certainly didn’t represent my views. I’ve never been a fan of economic Thatcherism or murdering foriegn children for oil.
4068 2018-09-12 16:09:12 Have you tried almond oil to convince them to drill something else?
4069 2018-09-12 16:09:09 Delicious! With French pressed coffee, blended with a tablespoon of unsalted butter and extra virgin coconut oil until frothy in electric blender. So good.

4073 2018-09-12 16:08:43 I am not an expert on upstream/downstream re oil, but 350,000 barrels per day (bpd) by mid-2019, strikes me as suspiciously high.
4074 2018-09-12 16:08:40 girl don’t wash your face every day it will stress your skin out!

i suggest using natural healing oil like grape seed and rosehip oil (rosehip smell like shit tho). i like using grape seed more.

don’t use drugstore cleanser that says “for oily skin” or “anti oil”
4075 2018-09-12 16:08:23 Mr G. just got and interesting fact, oil 3 % below 5 year average and gasoline is 8% above it.

4077 2018-09-12 16:07:49 Undoubtedly. But the selective blame is odd. It's like folks in Louisiana blaming the EPA for over-regulating but not the oil majors for filling their rivers with poison.

4085 2018-09-12 16:07:12 In about 40 minutes @TheDomino will host the @CNBCFuturesNow team and segment on the @HalftimeReport where we discuss crude oil --what's behind the rally--Iran, storms ?  And will it last? #oott #crudeoil

4088 2018-09-12 16:06:57 The assad regime is vastly preferable to a jihadist takover.   You know this as you suffered 9/11 but you still lick saudi butthole because they have the oil.

It's not the solution or cure. It's just putting oil to the fire. And I know because overhere we see it happening every single day.  I used to love my country.

Yes, eat that. Don't text him. Coconut oil.
4096 2018-09-12 16:06:02 Where are the 21 oil rich Arab/Muslim nations? Why not get money from them? Israel is a tiny tiny non oil nation that you want to destroy. Your Arab nations are flowing in money and oil. Get help from them.

4099 2018-09-12 16:05:37 The question remains, how many "scientists" can energy companies hire to make some ridiculous counter argument, and how much will it cost them to buy politicians to defend oil company's analysis and profits?#ClimateChangeIsReal
4100 2018-09-12 16:05:35 Dirtier than Saudi oil? I guess you're not counting the obscene levels of human rights abuses inbedded within the cost of foreign oil.

4107 2018-09-12 16:04:25 In this country we never discuss how to get rid of fossil fuel dependency.There is need for huge investments in infra projects to create new energy ecosystem. Govt need money for all this, can't just print new currency. Now only options left is to pay more taxes or save oil.
4108 2018-09-12 16:04:24 Got a new set of tires, oil change, and an alignment my bank account is sad 
4109 2018-09-12 16:04:05 Currently getting an oil change at pepboys and it’s gonna take a hour and a half. So I decided it’s the perfect time to finally listen to @deadmau5’s “Where’s the Drop”. So far I’m loving it. Should have listened to this sooner
4110 2018-09-12 16:03:47 This concept is great, now only if customer service was great as well. If you don't want to run out of oil ever, don't use restaurant technologies. 
 @RTIoil
4111 2018-09-12 16:03:44 Yup. Guess I didn't oil my filament week enough. Sometimes you gotta hate PLA and all metal hot ends
4112 2018-09-12 16:03:40 Makes total sense. what does big oil need. take the rights of indigenous. What does tom flanagan do. Take away the rights of indigenous.

4130 2018-09-12 16:01:40 We all need a great supply of cheap electricity supplied by Thorium Nuclear reactors to replace oil and gas. We need to heat homes again with electricity and run our cars with it.

Ahhhhhh
4132 2018-09-12 16:01:29 No, this a major repair after it failed in June. Multiple fried components, some of which were hand-made 40 years ago. And we use oil as the insulating medium here
4133 2018-09-12 16:01:13 @narendramodi To wriggle out of increase in crude oil prices we may seek alternative fueltechnology from Israel. It is fast, economical & without any conditions. Pl approach Israel without delay.
4134 2018-09-12 16:01:10 You are a snake oil salesman and a huckster.

2. Lay a quick Nuln Oil or similar dark wash onto that turquoise...It pops a little too much for a dingy theme and makes it harder to notice the other model details.

4147 2018-09-12 16:00:24 I heard on the radio this morning that we were third.  It is also a matter of metrics.  We've only outproduced for 2 weeks that doesn't make us the largest oil producer in the world in a longer term sense.  Not to mention that OPEC has been cutting back all year to support prices
4148 2018-09-12 16:00:13 You say this as our gas prices hike, much higher than Obama's.  If the US would recycle that oil, your point would stand.  But the US wants high prices to sell the mined oil at top prices, not give their citizens a break.  #dontbefooled
4149 2018-09-12 16:00:06 I've seen it reported pretty widely, but I do follow the news closely. And you're right that it's mostly due to "tight oil" drilling techniques; I just think people need a clear picture of the trends, not misleading statements.

4155 2018-09-12 15:58:43 It is advantageous on many levels to invest in non carbon and polluting methods of energy....smog our health, reliance on oil reserves is the actual cause of many wars for sure. new technology has historically been a driving engine of wealth.

4171 2018-09-12 15:56:31 The US is now the largest oil producer in the world, bigger than Saudi Arabia, bigger than Russia. Amazing. Canada? We’re stuck with Liberals and NDP know-nothings. Pity. #cdnpoli #ableg
4172 2018-09-12 15:56:26 cbd oil is g8. if you haven’t tried it take a whack at it :)
4173 2018-09-12 15:56:24 Wait until the Federal Reserve start raising interest rates to fight inflation and finance the deficit. Another small detail if you price oil transactions in another currency like the Chinese Yuan you are financing less of the US deficit for free.

4175 2018-09-12 15:56:16 That was when Kissinger came up with one of his nuggets that “Oil is too important to be in Arab’s hands”. End of Britten Woods, end of Gold convertibility and beginning of the long term plan to make what’s their, ours!
4176 2018-09-12 15:56:01 good god. oil prices will rise for any reason, no matter how loosely connected to actual supply

4179 2018-09-12 15:55:41 "Trump said the U.S. should be getting oil. ",,,,well I guess Maduro is correct to believe the US is making up a war to get its oil.

4181 2018-09-12 15:55:39 The restaurant I was working at last there were several people that would come to work skitzing balls. Speed and blow are pretty prevalent in the oil and food industries I know of first hand. It's scary how many truck drivers are skitzed out of their minds.

4184 2018-09-12 15:55:30 You have to be not-for-profit, not a for-profit (that doesn't make any profit), plus the words "literary" and Switchblade mix like oil and water. But thanks for the shot-out, brother.
4185 2018-09-12 15:55:27 First thing crude oil price not considered... Even if you want to go with this chart alone % should be in the bars not the price...
4186 2018-09-12 15:55:23 There’s this gorgeous guy that works at the front desk of my oil change place and he always flirts with me so like make a move or give me free tires. Please and thanks.

4197 2018-09-12 15:54:32 Madam @RaoKavitha could you please explain why your Government is indifferent to increasing oil prices? And why it does not want to reduce its price at state level?
4198 2018-09-12 15:54:17 @SenSherrodBrown   in Ohio we're not stupid we know CBD oil was taking off the shelves because the drug companies can't make money on it

4202 2018-09-12 15:53:55 Not a congress supporter but when crude oil was at 111$ barrel i was paying around 68Rs per litre but today crude oil is at 74$ per barrel and i am paying approx 88Rs per litre.  See the huge difference.  Crude oil is cheaper but still i am paying more.
4203 2018-09-12 15:53:54 Lastly, the oil lamp model seems a bit small...
4204 2018-09-12 15:53:52 I don't disagree. The oil will flow, by rail, truck, or by pipeline, but stopping the permanent infrastructure is their goal.

4210 2018-09-12 15:53:36 "The product is mainly made of salted cod roe (gadus morhua), sugar, canola oil and spices." 

What's the pitch?
4211 2018-09-12 15:53:26 Speaking of which, when I lived in the Bay Area, I once heard some dude in a Safeway refer to tortillas as "burrito shells." I don't trust anyone outside of Arizona, SoCal, New Mexico, or Texas to know what a real tortilla is. Hint: they have lard, not shortening or oil.
4212 2018-09-12 15:53:22 They are hucksters, scammers, and snake oil salesmen. They talk their babble and people give them their money so they can live the life of royalty, just to opposite of what Jesus stood for..

4226 2018-09-12 15:52:25 Try CBD oil orally.... it’s amazing & after I discovered it my pain is manageable.
4227 2018-09-12 15:52:21 Would be very happy if you could speak on increasing oil prices & why your government does not want to bring down oil prices?

4229 2018-09-12 15:52:00 The attitude and entitlement they display is why there is no hope for Chicago. To steal from a dying man is the lowest form of being. Their parents should be embarrassed of their "children." But, 'm sure the parents taught them these skills.

4240 2018-09-12 15:51:09 Look, I understand the implications of Trump shutting this down but many would present articles of impeachment if the man found oil reserves on Mars.

4253 2018-09-12 15:49:56 If replacing a diesel car, EVs must make thick black smoke so deaf people can see them coming. Also oil changes are mandatory
4254 2018-09-12 15:49:50 2/...by a whopping 19.6% in fiscal 2013-4, before anyone realized that the mid-2014 plummet in oil prices was in the offing. Now the UCP bitches about counter-cyclical spending increases of 5-8% under the current government even as we have the lowest expenses-to-GDP of provinces.
4255 2018-09-12 15:49:47 "all about the oil" is a massive over-simplification of an extremely complex set of issues... but you gotta keep the message simple if you want to sell tix.
4256 2018-09-12 15:49:29 Sorry grandpa, new technology doesn’t require crude oil- there will be no demand for it - no shortage of the sun 
4257 2018-09-12 15:49:24 One is oil, while the other is spirit.
4258 2018-09-12 15:49:21 The world isn't transitioning off of fossil fuels. We can talk about it, but just about every aspect of modern technology relies on fossil fuel, specifically oil and petroleum products.

4261 2018-09-12 15:49:13 Market Cap has nothing to do with how high a coin can go. MC is just a result of last price paid x circulating supply.

4277 2018-09-12 15:47:52 That sounds like your dose is a bit high. It's why I'm always reluctant to ask for an increase. My current problem is definitely my fault - I've fallen off my vitamin regimen which usually helps the adderall along. Have you tried a B-50 complex +fish oil?

4288 2018-09-12 15:46:49 The world maybe transitioning, and that's a good thing. But oil is still the biggest in demand energy source and climbing in developing nation's and places like China. It could take decades until alt energy surpasses fossil fuels, until then having oil independence is necessary.

4295 2018-09-12 15:45:50 I'm Indian. I'm a doctor. I spend a lot of time calling out snake oil peddlers in the West and in India. I use that term. It is not a racial slur nor anything to do with snake charming. Coincidentally I do think snakes are quite charming. Snake oil is a slur on them.

4303 2018-09-12 15:44:32 please tell me why you band CBD oil in Ohio it is saving lives and it's not a drug you would rather have drug addicts
4304 2018-09-12 15:44:28 That doesn't make any sense. Oil differentials and world prices have little to do with Canadian fed policy. 

And equalization is purely funded by general tax revenues, which also provide federal transfers for things like health, education, infrastructure, etc.
4305 2018-09-12 15:44:22 You'll probably want to invest in a splatter guard. It's a mesh screen one puts over a pan that catches any oil or other substances that may jump out of the pan.
4306 2018-09-12 15:44:21 Waiting on an oil change feels like the longest 45 minutes everrrrr :)
4307 2018-09-12 15:44:21 so the company i work for is an express oil change company, similar to jiffy lube. i recruit for store in bham. called candidate (they need a license to move cars) and asked if he had valid license - he said no. i said how do you drive. he hung up on me. lol. wednesday.
4308 2018-09-12 15:44:20 I'm more worried about World War 3 and staying in Syria long-term. Is it the oil or just that the Kurds are nice people? What criteria are you using?
4309 2018-09-12 15:44:17 Well said.  Too bad there's oil there, and Israel next door, vital strategic position.
4310 2018-09-12 15:44:15 Contracting a Chinese company to do the oil and gas work then splitting the take is cheaper than a war they can't win, even with our help.
4311 2018-09-12 15:44:07 @forestservice starting work on streamlining oil and gas regs for activities in national forests. Yays to come from industry, boos from enviros, yays from GOPers, boos from Dems. Just guessing. I may be wrong.
4312 2018-09-12 15:44:05 Why don't modi bring petrol under gst.ooh that might dry your party fund from the oil companies
4313 2018-09-12 15:43:56 anybody ever had a oil change from Walmart ? 
4314 2018-09-12 15:43:43 Blimey - good memory! We were cheated out of a win by that pesky oil in the road (you may remember my colleague went over too!) Hope all is well, cheers Ian

4323 2018-09-12 15:43:02 Except they were dictators and were pale shadows of Socialism due to endemic corruption/power hunger. None gave the people true Socialism where state ownership is used to help the people not line the pockets of a few. Venezuela came very close before oil price crash

4325 2018-09-12 15:43:00 When having to continue to suppress rate of prices rising until U.S. elections conclude in November, misleading market on non-OPEC production ability it just part of multipronged strategy. The truth will surface, the oil won’t.

4328 2018-09-12 15:42:38 I absolutely love First Aid Beauty. Not sure your skin type but I started using their oil free mattifying gel and it was a game changer.
4329 2018-09-12 15:42:11 Por que lo ves tan alcista al oil? Cuando sube el dolar no deberian bajar los commodities?
4330 2018-09-12 15:42:09 Yes feel bad for those frail multinational oil conglomerates. If we don't support them might just not make it. Real mom and pop operations they are.
4331 2018-09-12 15:42:08 Comrade Trump..Richard Burr has ties to Russian Oil. Of course he sees no collusion!  Burr is part of the problem!

4345 2018-09-12 15:41:06 Getting ready to play around with a pizza dough that is 15% sourdough starter. Water seems low at 64%, but there's also 4% olive oil. I don't think it's going to be as wet as what I've been working with in recent weeks. It's gonna be a different feel. Yes, I'm 100% nerd right now
4346 2018-09-12 15:41:06 Changing oil is very difficult, you know, like opening the car door.
4347 2018-09-12 15:40:57 Moisturizing your hair is just as important as putting oil in your car. 
Moisturizing your hair is an important part of routine daily/weekly/monthly maintenance for healthy, long, beautiful hair. If you DON'T moisturize, your hair can become damaged, brittle, dry, and break off.

4350 2018-09-12 15:40:53 Brother, Mr J das is right. Devaluation of US dollars have effect mostly on import of crude oil  and Gold. Exporters will be benefitted specially IT companies     which is visible on rising of their shares. Importers by large number has hedged the currencies risk.
4351 2018-09-12 15:40:43 Re @RonDeSantisFL's "unique relationship" with Trump: Does DeSantis actually believe his loyalty to Trump will be returned? That WOULD be unique.

4360 2018-09-12 15:40:19 We can learn a few things from this:
1. Keep threads short and straight to the point (depending on story line and flavour)
2. Use "thread numbering" so folks will understand the post is not just one tweet
This prevents a lot of drama (unless it's drama you seek)
My two cents
4361 2018-09-12 15:40:16 I watched Rachel's focus piece "Why We Did It." Money, oil, power. I'm pretty sure the world gets to despise us for this f@cked up atrocity by itself.

4364 2018-09-12 15:40:06 Yeah theres a lot of nuance to making the 60% vein single bite of mucousy fucking slug meat taste like anything. The art of using old fryer oil and smothering in offensive sauce
4365 2018-09-12 15:40:05 My dad: god your car smells like weed?

Me: idk 

My dad: well just let me know when you need an oil change.
4366 2018-09-12 15:40:05 These guys at the fuel stations who change engine oil are real criminals .

Herh if you don’t pay close attention they will just put back the dirty oil inside for you.

Changing the engine oil in your car is always beneficial
4404 2018-09-12 15:36:07 I'm sure it just went out for a pack of engine oil
4405 2018-09-12 15:35:55 Optimize the OC engine in any way!!! frequent oil changes, check air pressure, etc...

4407 2018-09-12 15:35:45 Yes and no.  The SCS potentially holds enough undersea oil and gas to supply China if imports were cut-off from the Middle East.

4412 2018-09-12 15:35:26 can buy more oil from places other than the US -- no structural need to buy US cargos.   conversely, for a small premium, can take delivery of a lot of US oil (and less from others).  easy way to move needle on bilateral balance
4413 2018-09-12 15:35:19 You are kidding right? You accepted donations from the NRA, special interests, oil, and for the tax scam. Then you push thru Kavanagh while hiding imp documents. Your hypocracy is staggering. You are the poster child for dark money.I will donate to get you crooks out.
4414 2018-09-12 15:35:08 Homemade dressing is usually a lot better for you, I don’t add any sugar and use a higher amount of vinegar to oil.
4415 2018-09-12 15:35:01 Since you're hung up on old shit and a hypocrite. Here's a little reminder of you bearing no pain from your stance on Libya that had you advocating bombs for oil. 

"We have a giant deficit. They have a lot of oil,"..."Should Libya pay us back?"
4416 2018-09-12 15:34:52 Well done gal
4417 2018-09-12 15:34:48 Is this weather making anyone else’s face look like they just rubbed a gallon of coconut oil on It or is this just happening to me?!

4422 2018-09-12 15:34:31 That means I repeat we still need oil from overseas we are addicted to this thing
4423 2018-09-12 15:34:29 USA has oil we can share with you.  Also, if we don’t use Saudi oil, maybe they’ll go broke. They should put their money where their mouth is.

4451 2018-09-12 15:32:30 It always collapses on the amount of power given to government to affect this definition of good. Read Hayek's Road to Serfdom. When they stole the oil companies (nationalized) the trajectory was set. Then it's all a matter of imposing more & more rule to try to save their good.
4452 2018-09-12 15:32:28 Saying bitcoin is going up because of scarcity is the same as saying gold or oil is going up because of scarcity, and those aren't circumventing the government. Anything can be supplanted.

4456 2018-09-12 15:32:06 Yep, the only other two countries to develop coal to oil at industrial scale have been war time Nazi Germany & sanction hit apartheid South Africa.

On water use, what makes China's coal2oil projects especially crazy is that they tend to be located in the water scarce north.

4485 2018-09-12 15:29:50 because it is cheaper than buying the equivalent oil from Russia when the tariff has been removed while providing the same refinery margin. After tariff added back on after brexit, UK crude becomes more expensive than Russian crude

4497 2018-09-12 15:28:49 Then you let me know how many nationalized oil companies that are successful? You provided 1 and I can provide you a dozen or so that are part of third world countries with some of the worst living conditions on the planet.

4515 2018-09-12 15:27:46 If Clinton won then you all would think every thing is great while she puts us in more wars, give tax cut to the rich, run oil lines through poor cities, and expand fracking. Yeah, first women president. Like we were with Barack, and he fucked us over getting us Trump.

4518 2018-09-12 15:27:33 The federal government is not limited by money.  They have as much money as they need for literally anything.  They are only limited by real resources. (Labor, oil, steel, etc.). The US does not really borrow money.  Where would they borrow US dollars from?

4522 2018-09-12 15:27:17 Yes he hates Obama. Yes he is controlled by the oil tycoons. Say Russia. It’s time to get rid of #trumpism. We need to end the Electoral College. If this hadn’t been around for 2016 #trump would not be in this position to destroy democracy.
4523 2018-09-12 15:27:11 Great job fear mongering to put in place laws that retract our freedoms and make the rich, richer and power more powerful. It’s twisted and you have to live with yourself. No WMD in Iraq, no ties to 9/11 but lots of oil and money. I see you, lots of us do.

4531 2018-09-12 15:26:14 eh, I prefer the term 'hybrid economy' because both have some state ownership of major industry

the intent of nationalizing oil in both nations was to turn it into a benefit for the people and not just a source of corporate profits
4532 2018-09-12 15:26:06 Damn this is late but any type of oil, like coconut or olive oil.

4534 2018-09-12 15:25:58 That’ll do it. Some cleansers can strip the skin too much and the oil kicks it to compensate. The sunflower sweets serum from Ayele & co (used to be Bahi cosmetics) helps with putting moisture back after cleansing. My skin used to be so oily before I started using it
4535 2018-09-12 15:25:54 Poor your snake oil elsewhere, I don’t believe in your fraud and cult. Never have never will and hope that fraud is in jail or dead soon.

4537 2018-09-12 15:25:39 Exactly Sir. Modi should not be given credit for telecom revolution as Ambani owns  Reliance.

But Modi is responsible for high crude oil prices, as Modi owns oil wells in Arab, extracts oil himself and transports it to Indian coast all on his own.

4551 2018-09-12 15:24:22 This literally makes no sense. You are giving Trump credit for an accomplishment that happened under Obama. Not to mention that Charlie information is misleading in part and flat out wrong in another. But all of this is beside the point because Trump doesn't control oil industry.
4552 2018-09-12 15:24:21 Mallya has no credibility. The fraudster who did not pay salary to staff, govt. taxes, oil companies, DGCA charges but plundered money on calenders, yatch parties. Misused his position as RS member. Media still giving him olive branch believing him. #VijayMallya

4555 2018-09-12 15:24:12 @narendramodi_in Resp PM :  Good evening.  Let the oil companies go for 3rd party audit on their expenses, overheads and projects.  Evaluate their efficiency.  Fix the base price of petroleum products without bias.  As per company efficiency, please decide prices.
4556 2018-09-12 15:24:11 Most of the oil is cooked, there not drizzled on food, but it's the amount of sugar they have in tea and in their breads and sweets, you only have to try their Indian sweets to know they love sugar!!
4557 2018-09-12 15:24:08 You can exfoliate your lips once a week by using sugar and olive oil.

4560 2018-09-12 15:24:02 The “God Of Reagan” had a large bout of inflation. But as soon as the oil prices recovered, the prices would have gone to normal. His taxes were PR as well as in manipulation of inflation rates.
4561 2018-09-12 15:24:02 Also explain what sepecific Obama regulations that Trump was right to remove? Is it the flood standards for Infrastructure is flooded. Is it the anti corruption rule that required oil/gas/mining companies to disclose payments to foreign governments?
4562 2018-09-12 15:24:00 I go through the same thing man. Things that have helped me cope is 10 drops of CBD oil and having a big protein breakfast first thing in the morning. It sounds like bullshit but it helps. Take care of yourself dood.
4563 2018-09-12 15:23:43 13 Oil Tankers now. Remember when Tweedle Dee & Tweedle Dum aka pizza boy and ex con said you won't get egg cup full of oil out of #Horsehill #UKOG . LOOOOOOOOL.
4564 2018-09-12 15:23:30 Yeah, it’s too bad you seem to like oil so much when renewal energy should be the priority. But hey, you can keep praising and following Trump back to the dark ages.
4565 2018-09-12 15:23:06 Russia is responsible for everything. ((Psssst Russia killed the dinosaurs, it was a plot to create more oil)

4568 2018-09-12 15:22:45 Oil prices crashed, for one thing; Also at least some of it is sabotage by the bourgeoisie, the arson of tonnes of subsidized food and hoarding of essential goods away from markets. And, more recently there have been heavy sanctions.
4569 2018-09-12 15:22:37 Very true, but it's unrefined. Do you have a fractional distillery to make the barrel of oil useful?
4570 2018-09-12 15:22:28 Politically motivated equivalent of NC Republican legislators sticking fingers in ears, screwing eyes shut, & saying, "LA LA LA Can't hear you Climate Scientists!" But they sure do listen 4 jingle of big oil, gas industry campaign donations no matter how many citizens pay for it.
4571 2018-09-12 15:22:28 Both! There are heirloom varieties that are green when ripe....the better option. No idea about the Southern version. Heat turns starches in the fruit to sugars, so either will work. It’s all about the cornmeal and grease. Olive oil or butter for me.

4587 2018-09-12 15:21:00 I don't mind fish (I eat it very occasionally). I wouldn't buy chips if I knew sausages had been done in the same oil but I don't ask because there's already so little I can't eat. I don't have any ethical concerns with it as it's incidental, I just don't like the idea.
4588 2018-09-12 15:20:58 Meanwhile elsewhere oil is upwards of 70$ pb. That means all producers are still trying to balance their books. If it stays stable at this price for the next 6 months, some government's will be able to breathe when it comes to the 2019 state budgets...
4589 2018-09-12 15:20:55 Panibagong oil price hike deputa! Kawawa naman mga PUV drivers natin. Di pa tinataasan ang pamasahe. Pero pagtinaas naman, kawawa mga pasahero. Pag uwi sa bahay, konti ulam kasi mahal ang bilihin. Kamatayan na ba this?

4593 2018-09-12 15:20:35 Waaaaay too hot a pan, way too long, also, make sure the eggs are room temperature and need more oil/butter. I think you also put the egg on too early as the pan needs to be hot ( but not too hot) so the egg doesn’t flow as much
4594 2018-09-12 15:20:29 Sweeet.... Enjoy the wave of current surge in crude oil prices.

Even the oil is drilled by foreign companies
4599 2018-09-12 15:19:56 Oil industry is putting money in the system because of the environment and the price of oil is high. The tough times you referred to, was because of low oil price, not because of gov'ts damage. Now why would gov't damage any industry or private sectors. A---Hole.

4626 2018-09-12 15:17:49 quality of crude is its lightness and lack of sulphur. However, does not make it better. Refineries invest to run the poorer quality crude because they can turn it into high quality products. This is the refinery margin - the profit a refinery makes running a particular crude oil

4652 2018-09-12 15:15:51 No ire, Frank. I'm just a simple country clean air lawyer w his eye on the ball.

In EPA's most recent National Emissions Inventory, oil refineries & oil & gas production emitted ≈ 800,000 tons per year of NOx, ≈ 140,000 tons per year of SO2.

Ag emitted small fraction of that.

4655 2018-09-12 15:15:37 Do you know why petrol and diesel prices are so high despite a fall in crude oil rates? Because the govt wants to collect extra money from you as taxes so they can spend on more ADs praising themselves!! #RollBackFuelTax

4727 2018-09-12 15:08:51 Solutions: stop buying from China & India. Libs stop complaining& let America become oil independent, throw Turkey out of NATO. How about we build a wall,crack down on illegals & then see who we should let in the country.Oh wait, you will all cry that Trump is a racist madman.
4728 2018-09-12 15:08:48 Florence is a big, dangerous storm that could wreak catastrophic damage.

In that way, it is the future. We will see more and more and more big, dangerous storms that could wreak catastrophic damage. The longer we burn coal, oil and gas, the more we'll see.

4741 2018-09-12 15:07:18 Scumbag seems an appropriate descriptor,  for those selling the snake oil known as religion!
4742 2018-09-12 15:07:13 With oil, always manipulation. But expected
4743 2018-09-12 15:07:12 @realDonaldTrump India and China must cut off their oil by November, Iran's oil should be removed from the market. I should mention these important points, we expect the sanctions executors to intervene in these cases in order to preserve the sanctions power.
4744 2018-09-12 15:07:12 I think I've heard that things with tea tree oil in it help but I've never tried it myself!
4745 2018-09-12 15:07:07 I’m not a Liberal and haven’t voted for that party since 1993. They aren’t killing the oil industry. The fact is that we need agreement from a neighboring province and indigenous people. Large populations of both don’t want it. It’s called consent. We just don’t force it on them
4746 2018-09-12 15:07:06 Hi friends!

Limitless potential of blockchain technologies in oil refining industry allows to reduce expenses of production and logistics. This gives an opportunity to create the first in the world decentralised system with high efficiency of production.

4747 2018-09-12 15:07:05 @elonmusk With Earth being 75% water, how come there isn't fully operational water-powered cars? Just like sunlight, we have an abundance, but it isn't nearly of use. Do oil companies own the patent? They holding out so they can make a profit on gas/oil? Can you help with that?

4758 2018-09-12 15:05:38 Oil companies suppose to have it.
4759 2018-09-12 15:05:33 Yeah. This is really good. But the flare-up is on my face, and I don't like using tissue oil on my face
4760 2018-09-12 15:05:27 Oil is a plus - cant say the same for others no?

4770 2018-09-12 15:04:47 This is like the first time the equities market and crude oil prices have a negative relationship. I also believe it will rise,  but the question is 'how soon'. The Fed rates are on the rise and the regulatory high-handedness is not helping matters.
4771 2018-09-12 15:04:44 Never again should we party on oil price rise!!!!. Even at $200 we should continue diversification of the economy
4772 2018-09-12 15:04:41 Pointin’ at the plate like he found an oil well.
4773 2018-09-12 15:04:32 Do y’all pronounce it oil or oil?
4774 2018-09-12 15:04:31 More oil subsidy though
4775 2018-09-12 15:04:24 So I heard Dan uses argan oil in his hair so I asked my mom if we had any and she was very accusingly "YOURE NOT DOING WITCH SHIT, ARE YOU?!" 
4776 2018-09-12 15:04:20 Since independence, Sudan's political situation has been very unstable. Sudan experienced several coups d'etat and conflicts. There is a clear difference between the predominantly Muslim north side and the predominantly African south. Is the oil business going to unite us?
4777 2018-09-12 15:04:01 We saw too many non technical ignorant people enter the space in 2017.

4779 2018-09-12 15:03:46 Well, the study actually says that we have the fourth most carbon-intensive oil on earth, with little opportunities to decarbonize it since our methane regs do not apply to it. Nothing to be proud of. #oilsands

4807 2018-09-12 15:01:30 I understand it is threatened but still somewhat stable, as long as crude oil prices are fine.
4808 2018-09-12 15:01:23 Or even better: Use more renewable energy, don’t pay foreign governments for their oil AND keep our reserves for later
4809 2018-09-12 15:01:23 The one I'm using is like a gel hybrid kind of thing? How oily is the oil?
4810 2018-09-12 15:01:19 Exactly. Just like he said we should take Iraq’s oil. What an idiot.
4811 2018-09-12 15:01:11 I said that two weeks ago. With the dominance of the geopolitics, oil prices could shoot up to $100/b
4812 2018-09-12 15:01:10 The deficit is exploding.  You remember when the GOP said deficits matter?  Well they do and Trump made ours worse. Much bigger story than you oil narrative.
4813 2018-09-12 15:01:10 CBD oil has been erased from the USADA list of banned substances list paving the way for athletes to use it as an anti-inflammatory. Anecdotal evidence is that it works much better than over the counter drugs and without long term damage to liver or kidneys.

4822 2018-09-12 15:00:46 He should have to explain why our secretary of energy needs to go there. Is it nukes or oil. Maybe they are coming with a plausible story to lift sanctions.

4830 2018-09-12 15:00:17 It's regional. Just like nobody in the midwest has learned how to say "to be"  E.G. " My oil needs changed" Should be "My oil needs to be changed".
4831 2018-09-12 15:00:12 What the hell is it costing for CBC Arsenault & crew to do this saga ? Never a mention of what a corrupt socialist system can do to a prosperous country. Is Canada still buying oil from them, and if so which dictator is stuffing his pockets with that windfall ?
4832 2018-09-12 15:00:00 I left like half a litre of canola oil down at the dollarama
4833 2018-09-12 14:59:57 Democratic socialist are the same as people that want healthcare for all that every nation except the United States have today. It is Social Security. It is Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps as well as giving money to the oil industry the republicans live.

4842 2018-09-12 14:58:36 How are oil companies subsidized? You made this claim that they are getting welfare and are subsidized. Please direct us to information about these subsidies.
4843 2018-09-12 14:58:26 Yes, but even the completion of the electricity interconnector with France by 2022; symbolic and help us reduce emissions. No oil lamps needed underwater  
As I said will we build anything (at all, at all) to reduce our climate impacts? Ardnacrusha helped replace steam power..

4865 2018-09-12 14:56:20 As long as it opens up the oil I'm fine with it...
4866 2018-09-12 14:56:09 2/2--Apportionment--makes investing in the Cdn oil stocks a bit of a black box; very hard to guess pricing and volumes with apportionment.

4869 2018-09-12 14:56:01 @narendramodi 
India, China and Asian countries should come out in open and declare that we will increase supply from Iran which will bring down oil price. Lower oil price is our interest and can't understand as to why you are not taking such drastic step now...
4870 2018-09-12 14:55:56 No troops means I have to kill EVERYTHING as I can’t claim objectives for a start... plus the old timers can’t move very fast... not enough cod liver oil I suspect...

4873 2018-09-12 14:55:40 One time in Venezuela no citizens need to work , they have rich oil reserve , mostly for all they got money from government, all when oil at 140$ , at 30$ inflation is 60K around
4874 2018-09-12 14:55:40 Nah you’re feeding it when you change it’s oil
4875 2018-09-12 14:55:38 Yes sayang. Jom i teman u gi beli oil ni 
4876 2018-09-12 14:55:32 I hear trash pandas hate that the American economic system is reliant on an aging transportation system which is reliant on the whims of an oil cartel in the Middle East. Should be perfect for @pmruiz's office.
4877 2018-09-12 14:55:31 1/2--Apportionment will also be a big deal in Canada-where producers have their #oil production restricted by pipeline companies because there's not enough room in the pipe for everyone's oil-but producers don't tell investors when or how much they were restricted until quarterly
4878 2018-09-12 14:55:24 De vill förstås mjölka sin nuvarande investering så länge det bara går. Och jag gissar att big oil och bilindustrin har många, många beroenden som är svåra att kapa, speciellt ägar-beroenden..

4880 2018-09-12 14:55:08 Let's end this.... from Wikipedia 

Roasting sliced or chopped sweet potatoes lightly coated in animal or vegetable oil at high heat became common in the United States at the start of the 21st century, a dish called “sweet potato fries”
4881 2018-09-12 14:55:03 MAGA. DJT said get rid of them. Mattis told his Commanders no more pushing them place to place. Surround and ANNIHILATE. No more infrastructure, no more slave markets, no more TV stations or oil sales. No more gays thrown off buildings. Again MAGA

4888 2018-09-12 14:54:12 I don't have evidence of the numbers-
but Maduro is driving people from the nation with the world's largest proven oil reserve to robbing Amazon Indians for food-
but he's Socialist-- so it's all good-

4889 2018-09-12 14:54:08 @narendramodi 
Dear Sir
Not sure as to why India and other Asian countries need to agree with US on Iran Sanction. The entire game is to increase oil price which will benefit US, Middle East, Russia.

4896 2018-09-12 14:53:38 Jason, is the deal about a pipe or getting AB oil to Vancouver. This week we got 200k+ extra barrels and heading to 300k+barrels to BC. Isn't that what's it all about, selling oil. Or is it about giving your big mouth something to flap about
4897 2018-09-12 14:53:34 Only Republicans get “asked to denounce”.

4912 2018-09-12 14:51:28 Canadian light oil discounts hit $16/b Tues--avg is $3.89 discount the last 2 years--HUGE!  Bad news for Cdn producers!  Pipeline issues now hitting ALL Cdn #oil producers, not just heavy oil.  Q4 numbers will be ugly in Canada. Sad.  Cdn oil very profitable without discounts.
4913 2018-09-12 14:51:24 A good friend, a Sr VP of a major oil company always tells me “you are so dumb you could be a banker”
4914 2018-09-12 14:51:20 The whole “oil” argument doesn’t make sense because they were already in Iraq and Afghanistan is the county they went into after 9/11 and there was never any oil there. In 1960’s there was a plan to blow up empty houses and blame Cuba so they could start a war and the CIA refused

4923 2018-09-12 14:50:34 In a bowl, mix 1-1/2 cups all purpose flour, 1 tablespoon baking powder, 1 tablespoon sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, set aside.

4924 2018-09-12 14:50:31 US Brent Crude oil is not the major source of import for India anyway. This chart is till 2017 it's for your information. Prices were stable in 2017.

4969 2018-09-12 14:46:03 Being the largest producer of crude oil in the world means higher oil prices are NOT a drag on the US economy. Higher prices means higher business profits, lower prices mean consumer savings. The country is insulated from oil price changes.
4970 2018-09-12 14:46:03 The government had between November 2014 and January 2016 raised excise duty on petrol and diesel on nine occasions to take away gains arising from plummeting global oil prices. #RollBackFuelTax

4995 2018-09-12 14:44:24 Do you know why petrol and diesel prices are so high despite a fall in crude oil rates? Because the govt wants to collect extra money from you as taxes so they can spend on more ADs praising themselves!! #RollBackFuelTax

4999 2018-09-12 14:44:10 My question is why they can spout this crap with so little media scrutiny?  It's not opinion. Their plans would be cataclysmic for UK's economy. That's accepted by Treasury, OBR, NIESR etc. Climate change deniers not allowed, why are these snake oil salesmen unchallenged on #BBC?
5000 2018-09-12 14:44:07 I expect he’d be getting rich selling snake oil.
5001 2018-09-12 14:43:48 It is now looking more and more likely that Trump will probably release SPR to curb prices before mid-terms
5002 2018-09-12 14:43:31 I was on the fringe.  It was, and still is, all about building a pipeline to pump oil to the Caspian sea.

5006 2018-09-12 14:43:08 Oil is a different issue. I wouldn't eat the seeds oils.

Perhaps a better comparison would be fries vs a boiled potato dipped in oil. Possibly a difference in how they influence eating.
5007 2018-09-12 14:43:08 My guess is they would start acting like Tarzan, king of the apes, not the big eco/oil project/disaster in Canada.
My rule is, when in doubt, dash it out. ie monkey-pox

5028 2018-09-12 14:41:12 The US continues to import oil from fascist dictatorships and might point out that the US became a net exporter of crude oil under the Obama administration, so this doesn't have anything to do with Trump or his deregulated economy. Thank you @BarackObama !

5096 2018-09-12 14:36:50 Why has the US ramped up crude production?  Some crude oil producers in the US can’t pump very profitability until oil gets to $60-80/barrel.  With OPEC holding supply down to pump up prices, it now made sense for the US to ramp up production again.

5107 2018-09-12 14:35:39 I wouldn't necessarily say a floor. What we are seeing now (after inventories) is that oil extends its gains. lower supply and increased demand as seen by higher refinery demand. Hurricane in the short term and upcoming Iran sanctions longer term are important to watch

It doesn't help that our NDP premiere sided with big oil and against legitimate engagement with Indigenous Peoples and valid environmental studies. It left people like me wondering what to do next spring #ableg

5194 2018-09-12 14:29:42 So far??

I got a small super cheap/basic one, and goddamn if I don't use it 2-5 times a week now.

It uses next to no oil, so breaded foods come out crispy and not greasy.

It's basically a countertop mini-convection oven.

5268 2018-09-12 14:22:19 I believe you can make tea from the oil, but I dont know anything else on it!
5269 2018-09-12 14:22:02 It's about the oil, stupid. Why doesn't the US intervene elsewhere where there's no oil?

5282 2018-09-12 14:20:29 So I started trying cbd oil for sleep. It makes me sleep too long. But ya. Thought it was worth a tweet lol.
5283 2018-09-12 14:20:29 I would add though, that while I totally understand why fear of (online) abuse might prevent someone from shouting from the rooftops that they work for (are sponsored by) the oil & gas industry, we can only change perceptions if we talk openly and honestly about our work.
5284 2018-09-12 14:20:27 Maybe we need to stop oil production....oil cools the Earth in its natural habitat.

5299 2018-09-12 14:18:57 It drives me mad! especially the coconut oil sold by at least 3 skincare producers I’ve seen so far. It can be bought in wholefood stores untreated, organic really good quality for £8.99 for 300g. Or £12 for 15ml by Dr Jackson
5300 2018-09-12 14:18:57 US Treasury Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing Marshall Billingslea accused Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro of "rapacious corruption" and operating "a kleptocracy," stealing money from a state-owned oil  company and government program to feed the poor
5301 2018-09-12 14:18:54 Rather short-sighted view. Public tenders may not be perfect but that's not China's fault...wanna check western oil investments in Nigeria, Angola, etc? Who brought corruption to Africa, China? Don't think so.
5302 2018-09-12 14:18:44 Just one tsp of olive oil. Doesn't matter - normal or extra virgin.
Works like a charm!
5303 2018-09-12 14:18:42 I suppose the trading statement in July gave a summary of what to expect(ish) - oil got stronger and Santos performed better so hoping for a little better than thought and interestingly future guidance ..

5315 2018-09-12 14:17:16 Can you find essential oils? Cause you can add them to the products you already have. Even adding a carrier oil like almond, coconut, olive oil, avocado etc.

Yet we have Sasol, whose fuel shouldn't be impacted by oil prices or USDZAR.
5325 2018-09-12 14:15:38 @Rudratej Your Engine Oil Liquid Gun is very cheap. Believe Me, i Used it for about 10000kms. Half of the Wear and Tear of the engine is due to your cheap Oil. Pardon us by giving oil from World class manufacturers like Motul or Wurth. They are much superior in quality.
5326 2018-09-12 14:15:38 Such an important topic. I've had similar experiences and I wholeheartedly agree with your final tweet: "I would challenge anyone to consider how the oil and gas industry affects their day to day life before criticising those people who work in it."
5327 2018-09-12 14:15:25 Snake Oil would be another great game. It would also teach children to hone their presentation skills. Speaking in large groups, even if they're friends, is always hard.
5328 2018-09-12 14:15:25 It balances you out pretty well.I would also look into essential oils literally rubbing some lavender oil a bit on your wrists and neck gives you an all day whiff of calming.
5329 2018-09-12 14:15:22 Uggggh. I’m sorry. I dropped a full bottle of olive oil on my tile floor the other day. There were no survivors.
5330 2018-09-12 14:15:19 Exactly. Invading Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11 or WMD’s, but both were used for the US to get at oil reserves that total 1 out of every 6 barrels that will ever be extracted from the earth. But a large portion of Americans either can’t or won’t see this.

5335 2018-09-12 14:14:52 There is possibility of non sustainability of high oil prices as dollar will strengthen further. US should do something as Iranian sanction will put further upward pressure on oil prices.

5344 2018-09-12 14:14:16 Perhaps the US sanctions doesn’t help. Keep in mind that Venezuela is oil rich and the USA wants in on that. Watch out for this propaganda.

5350 2018-09-12 14:13:43 60% of our fuel needs depend on outside crude, massive import bill (~R80bn). We must at least control Angola's oil (0.2m b/pd), no reason why we shld pay a badly run dependency in USD. Same applies to Lesotho & water. Otherwise we're finished.

5401 2018-09-12 14:08:52 @PiyushGoyal , History repeats. India has phased out steam when the assets were in their prime reasons being high cost when they could easily be converted to oil fired and now we see diesels being phased out in favour of Wires. Is there a RoR done on the routes or a mindless game

5409 2018-09-12 14:08:30 What do you want the government to do with oil ?? (HINT Subsidy means more borrowing and Tax means no borrowing )
5410 2018-09-12 14:08:30 So decided to listen to the radio on the way to work (1st time in years) PMS confessions *switch* Tuesdays are womens night and get 10% off oil changes *switch* Faith Hill .... where has she been?!

5419 2018-09-12 14:07:44 But it also is a very difficult position for a country like Bahrain that struggles with its economy and has to make unfortunate choices that imply short term economy vs long term sustainable environment. They chose the 1st coz they were the 1st to run out of oil in the region.
5420 2018-09-12 14:07:42 As much as the average person in first world countries contributes to the planet's degradation, it's nothing compared to oil companies, fossil fuel industries, and billionaires. The ideology that we the average people are responsible for everything is right wing propaganda.

5429 2018-09-12 14:07:07 I remember my first news alert: an offshore oil well exploded in the gulf and they couldn't figure out how to cap it.
5430 2018-09-12 14:07:05 Are they trying to find oil wells by reading the Bible and praying God?

5533 2018-09-12 13:58:15 I mean, it's oil so it's all fat.
5534 2018-09-12 13:58:15 My hubby has been in the fuel business for 30 years. The oil companies refine 83-85 octane gasoline. To get the gad up to 87 octane, they need an octane booster, ethanol is a non toxic octane booster. It’s also cheap octane so it keeps gas prices down.

5538 2018-09-12 13:57:33 cont... that have been established for decades that the Govt must adhere to in order to meet it's Charter and Constitutional obligations to First Nations. That's hardly *radical*. It IS *radical* to spend 4.5 billion tax dollars to buy a failing oil company.
5539 2018-09-12 13:57:30 China started focusing on emerging markets over a decade ago. With China launching it's own oil market, some countries moving to their reserves to Chinese $RMB , USA must be careful not to hit too many countries over the head with  $, they might just decide they've had enough.
5540 2018-09-12 13:57:24 "No more blood for oil!" And i guess now natural gas? Both of which we have plenty of.

5562 2018-09-12 13:56:01 And the very night before our Scottish Parliament came into being, your Labour Government at Westminster decided to steal Scottish waters (and oil fields) by moving our maritime borders.

5568 2018-09-12 13:55:43 Interesting stuff. A question that occurs to me - a fair one, I think - do these same US-based foundations donate to organizations operating in the US to oppose US oil company activities? And if so, how much? If they don't, it's pretty damning. If they do, is it proportional?

5583 2018-09-12 13:54:38 @realDonaldTrump  I saw today where the USA is now the largest global crude oil producer. If that is so why doesn't gas go down at the gas pumps? We need for the gas to be a lower price. A lot lower price!

5594 2018-09-12 13:54:02 UBS: We continue to expect higher oil prices over the coming weeks, with #Brent reaching USD 85/bbl & #WTI USD 78/bbl. The widening WTI-Brent crude spread, now near USD 9.5/bbl, reflects US pipeline capacity constraints which should act as a curb to any shale-driven output surge.

5626 2018-09-12 13:49:37 Al-Queda was definitely behind 9/11. They are not a scapegoat. The Saudis definitely played a role as well, but that does not exonerate everybody else. For some reason(likely oil) everybody is trying to protect the Saudis, but they were just one piece of the puzzle.

5783 2018-09-12 13:36:04 What to watch in near-term oil and natural gas markets...Bullish - Sanctions policies (Iran), natural gas inventories, export records...Bearish - trade friction escalation, OPEC production hikes, demand downgrades.

5807 2018-09-12 13:34:10 The government had between November 2014 and January 2016 raised excise duty on petrol and diesel on nine occasions to take away gains arising from plummeting global oil prices. #RollBackFuelTax

5822 2018-09-12 13:33:04 Aa1 with a negative outlook, because there’s NO plan to deal with the deficit. Interest rates rising and low oil will down grade the rating
5823 2018-09-12 13:33:04 And it is mostly funded by big Oil companies,  US industrial military complex, Mining conglomerates etc...
5824 2018-09-12 13:32:57 I found a edge control that’s actually called a pomade and it’s water based instead of oil based..I can’t wait until it comes I thinks I found the one

5827 2018-09-12 13:32:44 Oil hit 70.18 again
It's a real see saw
Lucky you got your car that will be saving heaps ok

5828 2018-09-12 13:32:40 The one more fact, UPA govt. created Rs. 150,000 Cr. debt too by Oil Bond which Modi govt. is paying. So who is miss guiding? 2004-14 Petrol price rise 13% year, matching with inflation at time, 2014-18 the rise is 3% is parity with 3% inflation!
5829 2018-09-12 13:32:38 Do you know why petrol and diesel prices are so high despite a fall in crude oil rates? Because the govt wants to collect extra money from you as taxes so they can spend on more ADs praising themselves!! #RollBackFuelTax

5861 2018-09-12 13:29:00 Yes, which is all the more important to make sure Libya stops them stealing resources. One vital thing for the Libyans to know is how much oil is sold at to foreign entities. I bet you it's dirt cheap.

5892 2018-09-12 13:25:27 This is why you wouldn’t last but seconds against @benshapiro the dems sold 20% of our uranium reserves to Russia, allowed China to access top secret information through Hillary’s private server for years. Yes bush sucked but he was a RINO who sought oil like his father
5893 2018-09-12 13:25:27 Circle of life continues on these 3 forecasting estimates.  19 is going to be epicly wrong.  Our economy runs on cheap energy believe we will front load all US SPR sales to avoid recession.  2020+ not any better.  Believe Iran gets all it's oil to market in about 6 months.

5906 2018-09-12 13:24:17 Mustard (preferably brown or Dijon). Rosemary. Lots of black pepper. Balsamic vinegar. Olive oil. Garlic. Coarse salt (if you have it. If not, table salt, just be more judicious with application).  Combine those and rub them on in a generous amount. Then sear the meat

5959 2018-09-12 13:18:07 This statement is misleading and needs to be corrected. I work in an OIL PSU and correct pricing of petrol excluding dealers commission is as follows:
Without taxes: 57.5 Rs
With taxes : 81.53 Rs.
Taxes : 41 % ( not 84%)
If brought under GST 28 % : 76 Rs.
5960 2018-09-12 13:18:07 my abnormal psych professor just said that there used to be a medical procedure to try to cure mental health issues and he described it as an "oil change for the body"
5961 2018-09-12 13:17:57 I have found firmly telling them that an oil change is it. And interrupt the upsell with "here for an oil change only, I'll speak to my dealer" whenever they try. It's such a PITA.

Future: EU gives EUR for oil/gas. Recipient buys EU goods.
Where is difference? Just eliminates  FX trades with no net effect. Or you disagree?
5998 2018-09-12 13:14:17 Funny how you can claim that when you consider that this lot look like nuns compared to the crooked snake oil salesmen on the leave side.
5999 2018-09-12 13:14:09 Please don't fry using poly-unsaturated oils, that's just basic chemistry. Use saturated fats for safe frying. High temperatures convert any starch to acrylamide, not great either. Healthiest fries IMHO are lowish-temp (120-150C) coconut oil fries.
6000 2018-09-12 13:13:52 China’s campaign to wipe out the Uyghurs started way before the existence of the camps in 2016.

6036 2018-09-12 13:10:37 @narendramodi If you really think of the farmers diesel prices would have been below 60Rs at least given the crude oil price... Fertilizers prices would have been lesser than whats been today. Both these increased like blood pressure once the BJP assumed office.

6055 2018-09-12 13:07:47 Sorry to hear! Some hoodlums did that to the chapel at @ukings a few years back. Make sure the wood gets a hearty dose of oil after it's all cleaned, that stuff really dries out the wood!

6073 2018-09-12 13:06:09 Oh, for Pete's sake!

From economic data, we know how many tons of coal, barrels of oil, and cubic feet of natural gas are burned each year.  We know the carbon content of coal, oil, and natural gas. Determining CO2 emissions from that info is straightforward bean-counting math!

1) No, they didn't. When the oil was discovered, unlike Norway which did invest heavily, the UK Gov did what they always do; they sold the rights off to private companies who get all the profits. That's why Norway has a $1tn oil fund and we have nothing.

2) It doesn't.

6203 2018-09-12 12:55:16 Hello sir, As an Indian citizen I am asking you to please focus on Renewable energy for the betterment of India, please promote hybrid vehicles and possible reduction of crude oil this way you can bring down prizes of crude oil and also save environment @PMOIndia @NamoINDIAPM
6204 2018-09-12 12:55:09 You can make an all-natural air freshener for your car by soaking a clothespin in the essential oil or herbs of your choice and attaching it to a dashboard vent — or keep a mesh-topped jar of baking soda scented with essential oil in a cupholder. #CarCleaningTips

My first endurance race. I was very nervous.
I ran off track 2 times on the oil in the first lap until I saw where it was.
My sphincter muscle controlled the throttle for many laps :)
We did not crash and finished 2nd, 2 laps behind #IanPero ( A grade) on a #GPZ550
All good :)

6247 2018-09-12 12:50:57 POTUS - since taking office has BEEN a KEY PART of oil pipelines. Kushner & Prince have worked ALL SIDES of the Pipelines. OIL is key to Trump's view of Turkey, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, IRAN, Azerbaijan, Syria, Israel, Egypt, etc. He owns pipeline & oil interests.
6248 2018-09-12 12:50:53 Either this or Trump's off shore oil drilling plan.  Oil rig will be more dangerous to workers and habitat.  They explode.  They spill oil for miles.  Wind turbine cables should engineer a sheath so lines don't get caught.

6349 2018-09-12 12:40:55 Why oil price is rising in every country ? What OPEC countries are doing ? Its a global issue now. Why not OPEC countries increase their supply sources to full fill the global demand ? As global demand is constantly increasing , time has come to find a alternative way.

6459 2018-09-12 12:26:51 Even the argument that batteries use metals that need to be mined in destructive ways fails to acknowledge that crude oil is just as destructive to mine, but then it also needs to be refined and transported several times. Instead of building something useful with it, we BURN it.

6473 2018-09-12 12:25:12 TIP OF THE DAY: Its worth remembering that engines on machines need an oil change more than once a year so its well worth taking five minutes one night to change the oils and give things a small service - try and catch the problem before it actually catches you!

6475 2018-09-12 12:24:55 Yeah it’s hard to know - either way with oil prices where they are - current numbers and production expected and all the other assets I’m very comfortable 
6476 2018-09-12 12:24:51 Kejriwal should be ashamed that he has not reduced the price of oil though Rajasthan did it.
6477 2018-09-12 12:24:49 Yeah, and the article itself is damning in ways I don't think matty realizes. The whole idea that trying to sell actual change while doing nothing to move any change forward--snake oil sales, basically--is a good thing is rage inducing.

6483 2018-09-12 12:24:02 I live in an oil town, getting rid of oil/gas is easier said than done, not because of the industry, but because of the feasibility of alternatives at the scale required.  We need to solve this problem, but the solutions right now are all oil/gas anyways

6485 2018-09-12 12:23:39 Medicare for all pays for itself with savings. The Koch brothers accidentally told us that. Free higher education could very easily improve economic output, by increasing out capital (that's untested), and solar power creates jobs while coal and oil lose jobs.

6580 2018-09-12 12:11:31 OK, So it is the same CO2 with every new diesel and gasoline vehicle produced compared to EV. Gains come with the EV on the street in place of a fossil-fuelled vehicle. Burning oil in a power station and charging an EV battery is somewhat more efficient than direct use of an ICE.

Non-OPEC oil supply in 2019 is forecast to grow by 2.15 mb/d, a minor upward revision of 17 tb/d. 

The US, Brazil, Canada, and the UK are expected to be the main growth drivers, while Mexico and Norway remain to be the largest declines.

6617 2018-09-12 12:08:33 beauty bloggers, help me! I need to improve my skin. My skin is VERY oily & very spot prone. 

The products I always get recommended and definitely don't work:
 
- liz earle cleanse & polish 
- no7 oil serum 
- clean & clear 
- lush ultrabland 

any alternative recommendations?!
6618 2018-09-12 12:08:29 And when will Obama own up to the BP oil spill, Benghazi, poor economy, lost jobs, low wages, Obamacare, and basically his whole presidency. And the biggest mistake is sending A country that wants to kill us billions of dollars!!own up President Obama.
6619 2018-09-12 12:07:55 Bush was a sh!tty president. This was the high water mark for his terms. It was all downhill from here. Failed to get bin laden, 2 recessions, one of them almost another depression, an unnecessary oil war. 

Conservative MSM needs to stop trying to rebuild this twerp.
6620 2018-09-12 12:07:53 A grown man saying oil money looooollllllll
6621 2018-09-12 12:07:52 I leave the technical details to @RobertMCutler 
I only look at geopolitical perspective overall. Obviously Iran cannot move oil w/o tankers. They luckily got Azerbaijan to include gas into Southern Gas Corridor, but they will continue selling oil via Basra around sanctions
6622 2018-09-12 12:07:46 Sometimes makeup acts as a moisturizer, which tells our skin not to crank out so much oil cause we’ve already got it covered. If I do no makeup without moisturizer, I get super oily too. It’s counterintuitive, but yeah. Moisturizer might help (or maybe not who knows)
6623 2018-09-12 12:07:45 Rupee will stabilize at 70 in the coming few days/weeks. Once the Crude oil settles down. If China devalues its currency, the rupee will go volatile again.
6624 2018-09-12 12:07:41 i just did a diy hair mask but i put in too much coconut oil now it's dripping everywhere help
6625 2018-09-12 12:07:38 Probably the easiest toilet repair. You probably won't need oil and your hands need not get wet
6626 2018-09-12 12:07:38 My jug of coconut oil is the only house thermometer I need. Wake up. SOLID=SummerisDying/Fall/Winter/YouCOLD.  LIQUID=Nice out/Summer/WorldMightbeMelting. All I need to know.
6627 2018-09-12 12:07:36 some billionaire will pat you on the head and invite you on his yacht. That would be arrogant twits who believe their tv viewers make them a God, when really you are just a snake oil salesman, peddling pousin for Big Gov aka corporate interest. YOU JOE are destroying our dream.
6628 2018-09-12 12:07:33 may be 
6629 2018-09-12 12:07:10 me: hmmm my car is making a weird noise, i wonder what that’s about
my car: we’re b e g g i n g you, get us an oil change
me: ... it’ll probably go away on it’s own
6630 2018-09-12 12:07:03 Transportation bottlenecks and too much oil supply:

Brent crude: $79

WTI: $69

Permian: $55

Canadian: $38

US gasoline is priced off Brent
6631 2018-09-12 12:06:52 Jesus spelled backwards is Susej! Like Sausage! COINCIDENCE? Punk rock was invented by an ad agency to sell spikey pins! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!

6633 2018-09-12 12:06:44 We are supporting, via Saudi Arabia, terrorism. Also Turkey is supporting EI by buying oil. It's all know.

6635 2018-09-12 12:06:24 hope these vitamins & wild hair growth oil do something for ya sister cause I need GROWTH
6636 2018-09-12 12:06:19 10 years investing in the Namibian oil story...... or lack of..... surely it’s time
6637 2018-09-12 12:06:10 Ohhhhh
Well, that's a good idea
6638 2018-09-12 12:05:54 Good morning from the Toyota Dealership. I’m getting an oil change JUST IN CASE we have an emergency evacuation. Also, my dad is coming so I have a feeling we will be traveling a lot this weekend :)
6639 2018-09-12 12:05:52 I'd actually argue it <might> be in Saudi and UAE's interests. Both now have operational bypass lines that enable them to export the majority of their oil even with the straight closed. Iran doesn't. IMO the war logic has changed and Iran hasn't caught on yet...
6640 2018-09-12 12:05:49 "Progressive" liberal agenda succeeding at sabotaging economy to a point where the largest oil companies r declaring no new investments till clarity and seriousness from govt. Its what happens when top Soros puppet-master in Ottawa was CEO of WWF Canada. Greenpeace CEO 4 PM next!
6641 2018-09-12 12:05:47 หนูคิดถึงผมยาวแค่ตอนอยากทำผมอ่ะ แต่ตอนนี้เบาหัวมากๆ ไว้ยาวไม่คิดละ555555555
6642 2018-09-12 12:05:42 The US is on track to become the world's largest oil producer based on 2019 production forecasts from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Moreover, the International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that the US will account for more than half of the worldwide growth
6643 2018-09-12 12:05:34 @realDonaldTrump What planet do you come from? Your response to Puerto Rico was atrocious. Success and your name is like oil and vinegar. Neither is a good mix. @Lorarmcha

6647 2018-09-12 12:04:55 I spilled lavender essential oil alllllll over myself, bout to be CALM AF
6648 2018-09-12 12:04:39 Also higher oil prices.
6649 2018-09-12 12:04:26 There is this guy outside the 37station...he has giant ones. Almost Crude oil barrel sizes i mean
6650 2018-09-12 12:04:25 He doesn’t like Trump, but he’s still a mega-rich oil man, who wants to keep all “his” money.

6653 2018-09-12 12:04:10 Theoretically, anytime rulers neither depend heavily on their citizens to produce nor to consume goods/services, the rulers simply dont need the citizens and the social contract breaks down. So if your main product is oil, anti-terrorism, software, political mediation

6655 2018-09-12 12:03:41 It's 8AM, I've discovered that even toilets seats can lose its will to live w/o warning, comparison-shopped for a new seat on Amazon, watched a youtube video on its installation ("use penetrating oil to loosen tough nuts!") & pray to god this day is very far from its peak #
6656 2018-09-12 12:03:36 Totally out of favour with the market at the moment - haven’t held for a while (cut a few oil positions as had a lot of exposure in the sector) but very tempted to buy back in and just leave them for a few years.

6658 2018-09-12 12:03:28 Congrats for your spirited and  resourceful press conferences these days to expose the vicious , fraudulent and manipulated workings of Modi and his gang. Their real looting is the ADDITIONAL excise duty which makes up bulk of PRIVATE oil cos Profit.

6663 2018-09-12 12:02:59 Oil value doesn't drop based on who owns the oil, whether people will trade for your oil is a much bigger factor in the economy
6664 2018-09-12 12:02:56 I’ve been using bio oil for years na since it helps with scars sa body as well. But for this routine specifically, i think like two months pa siguro. More or less. Kay i’ve been product testing man gud. Since summer i had these products na but i used it with other things
6665 2018-09-12 12:02:55 It's so interesting and telling when he says we should be in there taking it. Trump said we should take the minerals in Afghanistan also the oil in Iraq.
6666 2018-09-12 12:02:31 Venezuela has the world's largest oil reserves and the cheapest gas on the planet...even then it's economy has collapsed.

6668 2018-09-12 12:02:25 Tinubu is the owner of Ocean and Oil aka Oando... if you think he is fighting with just toll gate money or state tax you don’t know nothing Tinubu can be Otedola’s godfather for those saying Otedola will change the game
6669 2018-09-12 12:02:19 Pto is goofy to change, have to be on a slight downhill or it leaks oil when you pull the shaft. Pto also goes in fast, can't feather it in, so if it's starting under heavy load it's not ideal. Those are the main drawbacks we've seen so far.
6670 2018-09-12 12:02:16 Used to use my baby oil and coconut oil separately on my skin but I've started mixing the two together and wooo
6671 2018-09-12 12:02:11 Snake oil salesman pat.

6673 2018-09-12 12:01:52 I just bought a cool new CD/cassette tape player!  Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil! Most clowns are just NSA spies in disguise! Never speak secrets to clowns!
6674 2018-09-12 12:01:42 $USO - OIL is going for $70 right now - good thing I locked in my home oil last week and locked in USO calls yesterday lol well played!

6676 2018-09-12 12:01:27 Lemme go mix up this coconut oil for my hair
6677 2018-09-12 12:01:25 Understood. You might want to reconsider that source. Any pipeline from the Iranian oil fields to Oman would not only be well over 1000 miles long passing through internal Radion territory with very limited infrastructure, it would have to go <under> the Straight of Hormuz

6679 2018-09-12 12:01:22 @KeithMcCullough kolnavick wrong in june on EM. what about Gundy Guru now? He says time to buy EM, and oil up to $80 or $90?
6680 2018-09-12 12:01:20 Put your so called power to some use then dick head and find out who in America authorised this attack on the twin towers and the people of America and bring the right people to justice.killing your own people for oil. That’s sad 
6681 2018-09-12 12:01:16 Thinking this was exactly his intention- selected not elected! Purposeful bc not a stupid man- snake oil is right!
6682 2018-09-12 12:01:14 The government of Cambodia has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Giuliana Rancic in a spider silk wig.
6683 2018-09-12 12:01:11 Monday is going to be so busy for me. I have to get my feet & eye brows done, an oil change, tire rotation, brake check & wash for my baby & then on top of all that meal prep.

6686 2018-09-12 12:00:55 also compare oil barrel price
6687 2018-09-12 12:00:53 Oh gee just in time for winter heating bills.

6688 2018-09-12 12:00:48 it is immune from oil price too.

6695 2018-09-12 11:59:54 Early morning news shows OPEC members picked up slack from a 150K drop in Iranian barrels per day.  Demand forecast is lower, too.  So, why is crude rallying?  A selling opportunity could be near as more bearish numbers hit news wires.  Refineries are switching to heating oil.
6696 2018-09-12 11:59:39 Really ? Normally because there’s no humidity there. My combo/oily skin just neautralizes. Go get a sample of the Laneige sleeping mask or nitamins oil free moisturizer by origins.
6697 2018-09-12 11:59:26 Sorry to hear that. Did you get some meds for it? The only other thing I can think of that might help is marjoram oil - it's good for arthritis and rheumatism. Put a few drops in the bath and soak and/or massage on in oil. I think I have some too if you want to give it a go?
6698 2018-09-12 11:59:26 I'm pretty sure that if you wanted to bomb PR or steal its oil it wouldn't be "inaccessible". You failed these poor people miserably and don't have the balls to own up.
6699 2018-09-12 11:59:22 It does both. Takes about 6-8 weeks to make blemishes  indiscernible. I also use their tea tree oil exfoliating facewash to make marks go away quicker.
6700 2018-09-12 11:59:20 Truffle oil should be banned. All chemicals, no truffle in it at all.

6709 2018-09-12 11:58:25 Use butter instead of groundnut oil
6710 2018-09-12 11:58:08 Peppermint oil is the best for migraines. That shit put me to sleep and I woke up feeling refreshed.
6711 2018-09-12 11:58:07 @adkaromatherapy Good beautiful morning Gretchen! Odd question; do you have a grass essential oil? Is there such a thing?
6712 2018-09-12 11:58:05 Take a sock and fill it with rice. Put some peppermint essential oil on that bad boy and voila.
6713 2018-09-12 11:57:56 Questi sono completamente juncker (bevuti). Ora Orban potrà farsi corteggiare dolcemente da Putin che lo ricoprirà di soldi e oil per l'asciare l'UE così ci troviamo zio Vladimir dentro casa, dolcemente.
6714 2018-09-12 11:57:53 Was it to free the people there? Or was it for the oil?
6715 2018-09-12 11:57:40 no.. tea tree oil u mean or is green tee oil a diff thing?
6716 2018-09-12 11:57:33 BJP : we cant reduce price because we import oil and it is increased in international market.

MMS: BC.. do you think I had a oil well in my backyard?
6717 2018-09-12 11:56:41 Cleansing oil ของ fresh คือดีมากเลยว่ะ แต่เหมือนไม่ค่อยมีคนใช้เลย 
6718 2018-09-12 11:56:35 A political party which received kickback even in govt. to govt. deal (with Iraq  - Oil Coupens) would certainly doubt Rafael deal.
6719 2018-09-12 11:56:32 How the fuck did I just go into boots to get some bio oil and end up spending £90?????
6720 2018-09-12 11:56:18 Exactly why I think Democracy gas made the various Lazy because the sole source of income is Oil proceeds.
6721 2018-09-12 11:56:16 石油[タンク]︰an oil [tank]
6722 2018-09-12 11:56:06 Read the official statements of MMS in sep2013
And read the terms of Oil agreements with Iran.

Hope thatwould do.
6723 2018-09-12 11:56:01 Economy great , exposing deep state bad actors...getting ride of over burdensome regulation.  Gold price down, oil prices steady,  unemployment down. AA approval up to 36 % double election day....enough said....
6724 2018-09-12 11:56:00 I can’t believe they’ve legalised cannibal oil. What? Ooooh, cannabis oil! Ok, as you were.
6725 2018-09-12 11:55:58 hes talking oil. why do they think we dont know. Can we get and to get marching orders. What a farce
6726 2018-09-12 11:55:35 I don’t want to offend but it is their deep,unquestioned adherence to the bible and belief in snake oil salesmen
6727 2018-09-12 11:55:34 Oh so you agree now Congress was the villain thank you sir 
Now this is over, UPA is the main reason for increasing the oil price in 2014 and leaving a debt of 2 lakh crore for modi govt.due to this 2 lakh crore debt UPA gave rights to oil companies to decide oil price.

6732 2018-09-12 11:55:03 Body Shop's tea tree oil works very well for me.
6733 2018-09-12 11:54:58 We're glad you love the Ultrabland! All skin types can use this product, even oily as long as it is removed with warm water or toner. It can be better in some ways as astringent cleansers can make the skin over compensate & make more oil.
6734 2018-09-12 11:54:58 Ever wonder why Muslim nations are 3rd world? Except for Saudi which only became developed because of it's popularity in selling oil.
6735 2018-09-12 11:53:49 Omg I used coconut oil on my beard and it's SOOOO SOFT! I'm gonna be using this a lot more for sure.

The global GDP growth forecast remains at 3.8% for 2018 and 3.6% for 2019

In 2018, world oil demand is expected to grow by 1.62 mb/d, a minor downward revision from last month’s projection.

6745 2018-09-12 11:52:40 Bjpeee is following the footsteps of congress I guess even gone beyond in favouring private oil companies reliance essar all started back their closed petrol pumps after the victory of modi.
6746 2018-09-12 11:52:34 Oil is contaminated! It's run through the same system!
6747 2018-09-12 11:52:13 Moun Mohan in his speech said - 

"However, I would like the nation to remember that issuing bonds and loading deficits on oil companies is not a permanent solution to this problem. We are only passing on our burden to our children who will have to repay this debt."
6748 2018-09-12 11:52:12 So correct. Before oil, camels and sand was their economy.
6749 2018-09-12 11:52:09 If the truth is never exposed then they died for what? Oil?

6756 2018-09-12 11:51:08 + after i let it set for a few minutes i put bio oil all over my face for the scars 
6757 2018-09-12 11:50:54 I usually dip them in a mix of varnish, boiled linseed oil, white spirit and a touch of brown oil paint, then wax
6758 2018-09-12 11:50:47 castor oil helps
6759 2018-09-12 11:50:41 "transforming lives of millions of poor and farmers"?!

How?! By raising Oil prices and indirectly taxing people.
6760 2018-09-12 11:50:36 Im not sure if its because of my skincare routine but i use cetaphil to wash my face, then toner is thayer’s witch hazel toner bc alcohol free. That plus sunblock in the morning & afternoon. At night, same routine but i add two drops of tea tree oil to the toner para ma dilute +
6761 2018-09-12 11:50:22 Coconut oil could work well for her
6762 2018-09-12 11:50:15 Excise duties had to be levied to offset the piling deficits & 2lac cr oil bonds issued by UPA the interest of which was 70,000cr. BJP govt is working under constraints which needs to be appreciated.
6763 2018-09-12 11:50:12 Not sure about that. Serena's no oil painting. What makes the cartoon racist to me, is drawing her opponent as a white blonde.
6764 2018-09-12 11:50:11 This crying is for UPA govt, for giving all power to private companies to decide oil price. 
Cry hard I know it hurts

6767 2018-09-12 11:49:49 I need an oil change on Friday
6768 2018-09-12 11:49:42 I usually do it the Chinese style. Chop them in 2" length after thoroughly washing.

Add them to boiling water for just 2 minutes & rinse.

Add Garlic pearls (or chopped) to hot Mustard/olive oil in a wok and when Pink, add rinsed beans & salt. Stir fry for exactly 2 min & serve
6769 2018-09-12 11:49:39 I always find it strange how when oil prices go up the pump prices go up immediately.  But when they go down we have to wait while old stock feeds its way through the system.

6772 2018-09-12 11:49:18 Was talking about oil companies.
6773 2018-09-12 11:49:02 Oil has been driven by supply concerns (i.e Iran); While it is an input to inflation expectations, they have stabilised of late. Rise in 10Y yields a result of strong US data, which may or may not lead to a pick up in demand for oil. Is my understanding correct?

6775 2018-09-12 11:49:01 It's UPA who gave rights to private oils companies rights to decide oil price. Not NDA govt 
6776 2018-09-12 11:48:39 Quite, all about protection, protection of the EU's grip on things.
It appears to be slipping, maybe Brexit and the rise of the right will oil the pole a bit.
6777 2018-09-12 11:48:36 Cut that nail,its unhygienic and irritating.
6778 2018-09-12 11:48:33 @narendramodi @PiyushGoyal @arunjaitley @PMOIndia we paid more so you could pay back the oil companies. Now that that is done ,you can give us some benefit by reducing the taxes on fuel. You better do it the average person looks at his pocket first, you have dipped in enough.

6803 2018-09-12 11:45:37 Stealing a Sovereign Nations natural resources is a WAR CRIME it's the reason BUSH Admin. couldn't steal the IRAQ oil fields which was the only reason they started that war..it was Saudi Arabians on those high-jacked planes that hit the Twin Towers.

6805 2018-09-12 11:45:22 And then he flushed it all down the toilet by giving up on bin laden and pivoting to the oil war. Remember “I just don’t think about him that much” in regard to bin laden? I remember.

1. That he has not performed in terms of dividends of democracy

Or

2. He has failed to oil the hands of the gladiators in APC. Thus the need to weed him out now.

Let us be specific

6816 2018-09-12 11:43:56 Hey Redcap,

Trump promised to defeat them in 10 days. He failed. So Sad!

ISIS started to decline (but not destroyed) before Trump. They started to lose their grip when they lost cities and the ability to use funds from oil field they had captured but lost.
6817 2018-09-12 11:43:50 Genuine statement. Both govt are accountable for steep prices of oil.
In  the same way, both govt are responsible for PNB scam. Huge loans were granted to Nirav Modi& Malya during congress regime, while fugutives fled country in BJP regime. Unfortunately congress only accused bjp

6825 2018-09-12 11:42:25 Handling the oil prices is a tricky situation for the govt. if they do nothing it will affect the economy. If they reduce excise then too it will affect the economy. Hobson's choice
6826 2018-09-12 11:42:25 Timing chains aren't lifetime parts no matter what the manufacturer claims. What usually kills a timing chain is old and dirty oil due to ridiculously long service intervals.

6833 2018-09-12 11:41:30 Jeff,  get someone from KAM, haulage, matatu and oil industry.  Those will be better than the usual politicians.

6849 2018-09-12 11:38:30 She was employed by an oil company as an engineer on an oil rig. Thanks to the persecution by a major news organisation of a 26 year old woman she lost her job. If you do not know the facts it’s sensible to shut up.

6878 2018-09-12 11:35:22 Imagine what a N$10 Billion investment into renewable energy could mean for Namibia, split equallly between wind, solar and wave power. Angola exports oil, or energy. Namibia can do the same, with green electricity. Once the infrastructure is in place the 'fuel' is free.

6898 2018-09-12 11:31:45 "Not a possibility" need to get out of this ! Bharat can be "Sone ki Chidiya" if we simply reduce our oil imports. I would say govt should give all type of tax exemption/ depreciation on electrical vehicles.

6900 2018-09-12 11:31:17 It's about options. In 2014 petrol was all

Today you have electric followed by methanol and ethnol

If govt of TN wants to run on diesel it's der problem. I will take you to Nagpur to show how BIO CNG works through municipal waste

We get oil bond again & leave debt to our kids

6910 2018-09-12 11:29:53 Yup. I feel REER is genuinely misleading when it comes to trade competitiveness, because pricing and settlement of most commodities (most significantly oil) depend on USD/INR real exchangr rate rather than bilateral rates.
6911 2018-09-12 11:29:46 I believe someone has suddenly turned a page into becoming a Bhakt, by reading the Bhakt granth BJP Twitter handles. A comparison with world crude oil prices is required to understand how much the government has collected in taxes and how much tax did UPA lose due to subsidy.

I can still see that oil on your head.
6925 2018-09-12 11:27:46 PS. This mix can be used on any1 gaining weight, on any part of the body. I would avoid using it on the face due to the coconut oil. It can clog pores!

6958 2018-09-12 11:23:04 No need to worry folks, just had the results of my test. All results slightly under the mean average. I’m mega healthy. Slightly too low on my good cholesterol so I’ll be having the occasional shot of olive oil.
6959 2018-09-12 11:22:57 Ross’ is eerily similar except he should sprinkle the frequency of love around his neck to reduce allergy symptoms.  PS sucks about the window. But fortunately love and coconut oil makes everything better.

6961 2018-09-12 11:22:43 yes, last night's application of new vit E oil was not the instant miracle cure I'd hoped for
6962 2018-09-12 11:22:42 That's true. I support you till the end. You guys should also work on industrializing the state. Uyo needs an industrial area to maximize the oil and gas resources and also create employment for indigenes.

6973 2018-09-12 11:21:43 Presently brilliantly, but in a near-complete vacuum.
It's another version of the "endless growth" argument.  
What about resources?  Oil, soil, water, minerals?
All disappearing as the CBs print and borrow more from the future.

@INCIndia @JhaSanjay @RTforINC
6977 2018-09-12 11:21:06 And why is that stupid?  Because of the change in regulations, the price has dropped because the middle East was not selling as much oil due to the Texas boom.

6983 2018-09-12 11:19:30 I have never denied it. Fact of the matter is that North Africa and the Middle East are terrible at handling this influence. Above all it's their own responsibility to make something out of their countries. Instead, their greatest export products are oil and religion. Hopeless.

6991 2018-09-12 11:18:37 For those that want to avoid stretch marks: mix equal parts raw cocoa butter, raw shea butter, coconut oil to make it smoother and bio oil. 2 of my friends made that mix during their pregnancies and didn’t get one mark. #stretchmarks (if you’re sensitive then just use the 1st 3!)
6992 2018-09-12 11:18:36 "quite a bumpy road".......amazing what a few bill of oil brass does to smooth it out
6993 2018-09-12 11:18:36 Analytics creates robot players who are not allowed to think and do as their boss says. They lost their ability to think and reason man to man. Also too much rubbing the bats with coconut oil wears the bat out and body as well oil logs the bat making to heavy to swing.

6995 2018-09-12 11:17:56 rather than ham it should be cubed bacon,but yeah those are the main ingredients.

-mix it with parmesan till it's dense
-brown the bacon with oil (olive oil)
-when bacon is hot and ready, put it on egg and cheese mix
-add pasta

6997 2018-09-12 11:17:42 Even if the democrats ruin the “best economy in history”, I’d rather have a president that doesn’t make tax cuts on the people who don’t need them and endorse gas and oil rather than renewable energy because I actually care about the people and the Earth.
6998 2018-09-12 11:17:33 PMB used the excuse of low oil prices as an obstacle to actualize infrastructural development. Now the oil prices are quite high & this man is borrowing. It is obvious that the future of Nigerians now living & those unborn has been mortgaged. Nigeria is doomed beyond redemption.

But there r very few genuine traders&educators in India like @CK_Narayan, Sukhani, Tulsian etc  even today and I hope they wont disappoint their fans.

7030 2018-09-12 11:13:01 I was 18, on the subway, and was cursed at and physically threatened by a guy in his 40s for wearing a “no blood for oil” pin. The only thing uniting us was fear, and it wasn’t even the same fear.
7031 2018-09-12 11:13:00 Wheres the oil?
7032 2018-09-12 11:12:58 Copper is volatile, very closely linked to boom and bust in China. Long term it is an incredible asset, but it's possible to squander that kind of asset (see oil in Venezuela)

7041 2018-09-12 11:12:23 Ugh. So I'm not a fan of plastic, especially when it concerns touching my food b/c plastic is made from oil. Oil is being bled from our earth & that causes many problems...including cancer in some people.

I love animals. But I eat meat. Their hides have to go somewhere.

7063 2018-09-12 11:09:35 Pierre had the huge benefit of having oil and gas right after the OPEC oil crisis that he could take a tough line because the US needed us.   Mulroney used it to get free trade. 

Today the US has its own oil & gas and is the biggest supplier to Eastern Canada.  Tough situation.
7064 2018-09-12 11:09:27 Not to be patronising here but if we take North sea oil out of the equation Scotland has taken more than given to the Union since its inception. How is that being opressed? We both benefit from the Union and also being in the EU #StrongerTogether

7166 2018-09-12 10:53:17 I understand that, Iraqi state companies are not doing it directly,  oil companies are behind production growth everywhere that is growing. But the water poisoning crisis in Basra derives directly from a failure to manage projects run by foreigners.

7245 2018-09-12 10:40:45 In 1940 the world used 5 million barrels of oil per day which grew to 61 MMbod by 1980, That is about when the discovery of Super Giant oil fields came to a hard stop. We now use 100 MMbod from 5 MMbod in 1940. Oil must be priced at over $100 a bbl to have any hope of keeping up.

7277 2018-09-12 10:36:20 Is that oil floating in the middle?

7291 2018-09-12 10:33:17 is our govt/system/oil companies r serious on reducing petrol and diesel prices?and this problem can easily be sorted out by state/center govt by reducing excise and VAT on these products?but why they will do so?let the ppl cry and die?who care for ppl hue and cry?
7292 2018-09-12 10:32:59 International Oil Companies are behind Iraq's oil production growth. Probably more than two-thirds of current Iraqi oil production (and revenue) can be attributed to IOC investment and activity since 2010.

7296 2018-09-12 10:32:31 So, should Canada adopt the same principals they use for dairy production for when it comes to oil production? Only produce what we need, and regulate pricing?

7298 2018-09-12 10:32:23 I see everyone complaining about the pipelines but I don't see anyone offering any solutions. I get it that no one wants a pipeline running through their backyard. Where do you propose the oil companies put them?  Would love to hear your answers to that .

7310 2018-09-12 10:29:18 What worries me with olive oil is that it denatures and oxidizes when it hits its smoke point temp which is already very low. I might fry fish in olive oil because its low temp cooking, but I wouldn't sear a steak or stir fry with it.

7353 2018-09-12 10:24:01 .Under PMB, there is no debt that was used to pay salaries, the money was rather channelled on building infrastructure. States are owing bcos oil price has crashed and oil is the mainstay of economy, this affected their monthly subsections, coupled to this the individual debt..

7365 2018-09-12 10:22:08 Yes - saturated fat is miles better, without question. But people are often still resistant to the idea of cooking in animal fat (I know!) so EV olive oil is a good way to start the transition.
7366 2018-09-12 10:20:50 I always used to think (and still do) that the environment should be at the top of our priorities. But I'm reading about there being no oil left by 2050. How will we survive without oil? What is being done to find an alternative energy source? What is the replacement for oil?

7437 2018-09-12 10:09:27 There’s no assumption at all but plain truth. Not cheaper than the international prices, that’s ignorant to say and is impossible, but previous government was giving petrol at ₹75 when crude oil was $110 per barrel. Now crude oil is something around $75. Search it.
7438 2018-09-12 10:09:17 As #FuelPriceHike continues to pinch the common man, govt offering #ethanol as the new solution. 
@dpradhanbjp says Oil Marketing Companies will now procure #ethanol produced from B- heavy mollases.
Good idea is it? Anyone?

7450 2018-09-12 10:06:47 Oil eased on Wednesday, having neared its highest level this year  after a drop in U.S. crude inventories and the prospect of the loss of  Iranian supply added to concerns over the delicate balance between  consumption and production.

In this economic downturn, Modi govt. under real threat know that votes will come from firefighting the combined turmoils of worsening ₹ / inflation / oil / market situations.
Will the efforts succeed? Time will tell.
7468 2018-09-12 10:03:54 I’ve seen this snake oil before. My guess is its something to do with technology (that will be fitted to all UK and EU trucks, vans and tractors) and use 4G phones to report on movements (when you cant get a phone signal in Fermanagh or most of the Sperrins) by March 2019.

- a PM who answers questions honestly
- an oil industry that thrives 
- no carbon tax
To name a few.

7507 2018-09-12 09:57:46 Modi government purchases crude oil from the international market which is cheaper right now, but still selling petroleum products at high prices. 
Either people have lost their brain or they intentionally don’t want to understand the scenario.

7509 2018-09-12 09:57:30 Germanification of Syria is a good point. US presence in the east is Trump grabbing the oil through its Kurd sockpuppets. Russia and Iran will keep presence in the west of Syria. This is much more dangerous than during Cold War as this time no communication between superpowers

7520 2018-09-12 09:55:37 The rise of the high sugar high seed oil combo  was a deliberate result of vilifying meat, saturated fat  & creating guidelines where natural foods ended up in the red zone.

7527 2018-09-12 09:54:14 use a face serum, any one works well. or you can replace your lotion with coconut oil, but i would only use that to go to bed, and by the time you wake up your skin soaked up the coconut oil and your face is hydrated.

I have my reservations about him and any oil money billionaire.
7554 2018-09-12 09:50:15 As far as relying on China for our steel, think back when we relied on Arab countries for our oil, and the oil embargo that followed. That cheap oil wasn't so cheap anymore. Next World War will be with China and Russia, and they won't be selling us steel then.

So anyway, expect toffee in THK.

7687 2018-09-12 09:28:10 Perish the thought of any tomato in a Kashmiri or Persian Roghan Josh. They've probably included tomato from bastardised versions & the "stewed in ghee" from wiki definitions. Roghan could mean ghee or  oil in Urdu or Persian, though in Kashmiri its also used for the colour red
7688 2018-09-12 09:27:55 The Opposition must Revolt against such Fracking Projects as Water Levels Reduce in the Region.. The Opposition should Throw out the Pvt Oil & Gas Firms Business Owners out of the Country as they are Causing Water Levels to Deplete in the Country by such Fracking Projects.

7690 2018-09-12 09:27:39 Yea, they don't but its not as easy as that. Chinese goods will flood Iranian markets and weaken domestic businesses. Plus China has to ship the oil and most shipping companies/insurance companies DO have exposure so it will make it slightly harder. Proof China is a real US enemy
7691 2018-09-12 09:27:33 There is nothing to discuss. Israel and all Jews are owed a massive apology from the Arab world.
It's because of oil that antisemitism has been legalised by many.

7696 2018-09-12 09:26:14 .@bbc5live People need to learn how to cook before they think about what to buy. Example: Knowing how to turn tomatoes, olive oil, basil and garlic into a great pasta sauce (all cheap ingredients) will make you feel more confident and adventurous in the kitchen as a student
7697 2018-09-12 09:25:52 When you realize how much is been spent daily to pleasure the nose. You will be thankful to God for your whole body. I got a gift of 16k perfume bottle and some persons paid even more for the oil. And the only function of the oil is to smell nice.

7711 2018-09-12 09:23:57 Worldwide Market forces & international Currency Movements determine the price of traded commodities such as Oil or Gold.

7726 2018-09-12 09:22:04 Let’s just say we charge everyone an annual deductible and we charge anyone that goes to the GP a fee. We also ask those receiving specialised care to pay extra and to cover any materials and equipment. We could then take those savings and call it, say, an “oil fund”. Sound good?

They're the equivalent of doughnuts, but are elongated in shape.

7964 2018-09-12 08:42:24 Oh... My god, you want everyone to believe oil selling nations are foolish to give India credit and collect the debt after 5 years at a reduced market rate. Superb!!!
Oil bonds are just like buying using credit cards, there is a guarantee that one will pay. And with interest.

8037 2018-09-12 08:28:19 The states  are equally charging more tax. IMO it is good because 85% of oil is imported where India does not have any control. Less price means more consumption which means more fall of Rupee.This will act as a pressure to find alternate fuel like ethanol or bio fuel or EVs.

8231 2018-09-12 07:49:34 Exactly what I said. Gove the snake oil salesman, slimy as ever. 
8232 2018-09-12 07:49:26 Don't often hear them admitting this: "A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: "The oil and gas industry is crucial to the UK's economy and energy security."

8234 2018-09-12 07:49:08 We are small country but we prefer fight against aggressor. And what about Europeans ? For gas and oil there can sell there's strategy partners ?
8235 2018-09-12 07:48:52 OIL OIL OIL . と紙に書くとサザエさんに聞こえる。
8236 2018-09-12 07:48:18 Maathoda Hussain must know better  he can read it bending over with his Johnsons baby oil 
8237 2018-09-12 07:48:10 How much is the growth oil
8238 2018-09-12 07:48:03 Boil cannabis and drink it..it helps or extract the oil n drink
8239 2018-09-12 07:47:36 Burning that midnight oil...

8240 2018-09-12 07:47:35 Oil is black in crude form yet they were called for purified natural eish, this lot. 

Just indicates level of thinking, toddlers.
8241 2018-09-12 07:47:30 It is also why the US can send their crude oil to SK and it is competitive. All down to the KORUS FTA between the countries. It allows the US to compete against crude and condensate from the Middle East. How many more industries get hurt with Brexit?
8242 2018-09-12 07:47:20 DT200WR にYAMAHAの赤缶を分離に入れて混合200:1でCastar oil入れてます‼︎
8243 2018-09-12 07:47:07 If the price of oil increases; all others will.
Except daw sa mga putot
8244 2018-09-12 07:46:53 Congress ki gov ke time par toh bohath pukarte the ab bolre bjp waale hamare hath me nahi hai jab congress ki gov thi jab kyu yaad nai aya unlog ke hath me bhi nahi hai bolkar oil price badana ya kam karna
8245 2018-09-12 07:46:30 Indians are traditionally abused as snake charmers. Snake oil sellers is an innovative slur on the community.
8246 2018-09-12 07:46:22 His profile is just disgusting. But at least he's totally not cautious and it's easy to track oil money going through him and dozens of pages. Sadly the guy from Forbes is also on the paytoll list.
8247 2018-09-12 07:45:55 Why is it that we are exporting refined petrolium products to country like UAE,  malyasia in half the price that what they are charging for crude oil.
8248 2018-09-12 07:45:28 #oilprice rose as #crude oil #inventories in #USA fell & as looming sanctions against #Iran raised expectations of tightening supplies, with top producer #Russia warning of "fragile" global crude market

8249 2018-09-12 07:45:28 Isn't oil prices depend on international market price 
8250 2018-09-12 07:45:11 similarly iran india is gonna use rupee-rial  for transactions an iran bank pasargad has been allowed by RBI to function in mumbai specially for oil trade @yasmeen_9  the local currency transactions will bind the block!

8255 2018-09-12 07:44:40 letting it air dry & then grease my scalp with coconut oil
8256 2018-09-12 07:44:29 it's ridiculously easy to make btw. fry it up with a little sugar and soy sauce and add some sesame oil at the end
8257 2018-09-12 07:44:26 ACA was a rightwing hc plan from the Heritage Foundation. Yes it added millions more to the for-profit ins ranks but fell FAR short. "Joined the paris agreement" while pushing fracking & pipelines. In fact Obama oversaw the biggest increase in oil & gas production in US history.
8258 2018-09-12 07:44:14 Agri dept has to identify, popularise, guide and provide stubs or seeds with ways of marketing and about profitability of such crops according the soil, weather and availability of water. Oil seeds, vegetables, pulses are some of the options. Banana is also an option.
8259 2018-09-12 07:43:55 You're not a child. Grab some olive oil and let's take the cow to the disco inferno.
8260 2018-09-12 07:43:54 Because Saudi Arabia expends too much money  to show the reality other way around. Instead of Iran, this is Saudi Arabia that should be blamed for 9/11. This is the oil money used to clean Saudi’ reputation!
8261 2018-09-12 07:43:35 The US has $Trillions in liquid fuel infrastructure. Bridges, roads, highways, refineries, pipelines, ports, suburbs and malls. They needed a reason to bomb anyone they needed to bomb in order to control oil and gas markets. They had motive, and opportunity.
8262 2018-09-12 07:43:20 I dislike Nationalism in all forms. It is regressive. With globalisation in business we need globalisation in governance a stronger UN etc. But yes I agree SNP is more 1970s Nationalism.  It relies on having a sovereign oil wealth fund - which it could have had in 1970.
8263 2018-09-12 07:43:18 Yan di na tayo masizero hahahaha bonus daw pag napangalanan yung oil sa necklace nya 
8264 2018-09-12 07:43:18 Some advantages of this oil companies can invest in new discoveries of oil and gas fields 
Decreasing our imports 
And gov can invest in infrastructure which lacks in india
Though high oil price is going to make indian products less competitive

8269 2018-09-12 07:42:33 I have a 2008 kind of feeling but more India centric :| overpriced equity market. Rising oil prices. :(
8270 2018-09-12 07:42:22 911 was starting point to get to oil reach  countries.
8271 2018-09-12 07:42:21 Guys legit question here:

Does South Africa supply petrol/oil to Botswana?
Because I'm pretty sure their fuel price is half what ours is and this doesn't make any sense.

8278 2018-09-12 07:41:35 If oil prices and ruper weakening goes on like dis 
 Then no need to imagine
It may become unfortunate reality
8279 2018-09-12 07:41:33 Many Danes enjoy the benefits of Denmark being the first mover? With Vestas being a global leader in wind turbines and Orsted being just about the only oil and gas company that has succesfully transitioned into renewable energy and spectacular growth, escaping carbon lock-in.
8280 2018-09-12 07:41:19 Not once in a while the entire food in the house is cooked on normal oil but why separate special treatment ? It's a valid question

8290 2018-09-12 07:39:39 I have an oil for that  but I’ll be praying for y’all 
8291 2018-09-12 07:39:28 @rsprasad before 2014 ravi, when UPA was in power then on rising fuel prices you raise ur eyebrows to congress. And now u r in power then u say that oil prices increases globally..this double standard attitude of urs has made india miserable.
8292 2018-09-12 07:38:59 He used to work on some of the biggest burners in the country so has always liked steam engines and their boilers. When Corgi came in he got out of gas and went on his own with oil. I think he could foresee all the problems we currently have. 
8293 2018-09-12 07:38:51 @alynsmith @SNP Good God NO sign of either of the SNP MEPs at Junkers State of the Union Speech in the Chamber. The most important of the year !!!!! Strange for people who want to hand Scotland's freedom, oil and fishing to foreign European powers.
8294 2018-09-12 07:38:45 @BigBazaar is mountain modak game cupon valid on oil purchase
8295 2018-09-12 07:38:43 You can use any oil you like, but my advice would be only use an oil that you would use on your food (I found standard olive oil was best!) wash the tops down first, then lightly sand with the grain, wipe with a damp cloth, then oil and allow to dry!

8299 2018-09-12 07:38:21 Oil revenue per person per 
annum in Nigeria in 2013 when crude oil prices averaged over US$100 per barrel was US$520. 

In Qatar and Kuwait, it was US$31,000 and US$27,000 per 
person respectively.

8309 2018-09-12 07:36:07 Chiropractic can help w/ misalignment, sprained areas, etc. Ruptures need different help.  Acupuncture,  CBD OIL for inflammation, healing, pain and stress relief. The Ryfe vibratory machines and Denas machine from Russia both are fantastic.

8311 2018-09-12 07:35:38 I say focused in the sense that some things of interest in those states made them established their presence there. E.g Lagos: Admin Centre/HQ during colonial rule before capital was moved from Calabar to it, PH: Crude Oil, Abuja: new Federal Capital Territory
8312 2018-09-12 07:35:33 Been a week since I took my car in for a minor service, still at the shop waiting on parts to fix an oil leak that wasn't there when I dropped it off
8313 2018-09-12 07:35:32 Oil Prices rose following a report of declines in U.S. crude inventories and as looming sanctions against Iran raised expectations of tightening supply, while top producer Russia warned of a fragile global crude market.

8320 2018-09-12 07:34:33 Yeh but those moderate terrorists are “our guys”.  Also, Mr Hunt, as an out and out sociopath just wants to secure a route for gas/oil pipeline from Qatar/Saudi through Syria so those pesky Russians suffer. Smoke and mirrors...

8322 2018-09-12 07:33:52 I know but it was better rhetoric.. to be fair it's 1970s (as in dependent on retained North Sea Oil - now impossible ) Scottish Nationalism
8323 2018-09-12 07:33:44 Does 'you' refer to govt / OMCs or general public. If it is latter, how does the rupee spent in buying/selling can control the fall of rupee against other currencies. If it is to stop export of all oil products then rupee might get stronger as imports fall :)

8334 2018-09-12 07:31:35 Comparing oil prices is okay. But we have to compare highway, railway tracks construction, doubling of tracks, electrification, underpass, overbridge etc.

8382 2018-09-12 07:20:39 At that time govt subsidised heavily & yet inflation was 10-12%.They issued bonds to OMC.That ensured an oil bill of 1.3LCr became 2L Cr.If subsidy had been removed price would be around 100/L. That would have been ok when they had controlled inflation w/O oil price incr.

8464 2018-09-12 07:06:22 Both of them made the same promise. That was around the time they kept on saying oil production was going to be something like 10 million bpd. I was trying to find a quote from Maliki saying they were preparing to retake Mosul in 48hrs does anyone else remember that?

The cost price may undergo a change depending on crude oil price. When excise duty is fixed amount VAT is calculated as some percentage of Cost price.  This cost price is not the basic cost.  it is Basic cost +Excise duty+Dealers commission.  Why VAT shd be mkt driven

8654 2018-09-12 06:34:17 So in 2014 the BJP lied to the people about stabilising the economy it's been 5 yrs and they have had 4 dood yrs on low crude oil prices,monsoons etc

8896 2018-09-12 05:51:47 If that really happens -> extremely bullish for offshore oil
8897 2018-09-12 05:51:45 Our government, especially Theresa May and her husband, along with Blair and his supporters from both sides. The USA, ISRAEL, and their ilk, ALL NEED TO BE TRIED FOR WAR CRIMES  AGAINST ALL HUMANITY. They have committed these crimes across the globe for oil and other commodities.

8902 2018-09-12 05:51:16 Also note the claim of the UPA oil dept was 2lac odd crore, and they have garnered over 10lac odd crore in the price escalation via tax increase and lower crude oil prices. So that claim by BJP is bogus. What happened to the 8 lac odd crore, well 4000 crore went into PM photo ops
8903 2018-09-12 05:51:15 #BreakingNews: Washington clarified that it is not offering waiver to any country from curbs on commercial deals with #Iran and restriction applies to #India which is a major importer of oil from Iran & applies to investments in Iran’s #Chahbahar port, a project built by India.
8904 2018-09-12 05:51:12 I meant the reason for invading. People always cite minerals and/or oil as reason but I’ve never seen any hard evidence this is the case.
8905 2018-09-12 05:51:00 Today was my 7th day taking the Black Seed Oil and I can truly say it has a different affect on me! My face is getting brighter by the day and I have more energy too 
8906 2018-09-12 05:50:57 Issue of oil bonds by congress to keep fuel prices low and please public. This was a national crime for which congress leaders should be put behind bars. Aur malaum hai na Rahul aur Kejri dono bhai hain !
8907 2018-09-12 05:50:52 bro I hate the smell of coconut oil
8908 2018-09-12 05:50:42 I don’t know much about cars and Dallas normally does our monthly service check but this retard somehow forgot and I ended up with no oil or water(kinda my fault also but still LOL) thanks for uncles
8909 2018-09-12 05:50:19 Ahhh another year of still pretending 9/11 wasnt an inside goverment job in order to rile public opinion against the middle east so protecting the us interests in the oil fields by invading them wouldnt be questioned lol
8910 2018-09-12 05:50:16 Sweaty guy tips to avoid sweat: 
Have anything with menthol like peppermint oil, efficascent oil, white flower and even Vicks, on you at all times. Put some on your forehead, upper back and neck, and arms before going out, just tiny drops, to cool yourself down.
8911 2018-09-12 05:50:07 Nivea essentially enriched lotion in the blue bottle , has almond oil in it , it’s the best!  dollar general, Walmart, target, etc. lol
8912 2018-09-12 05:49:46 10 years ago 1 barrel crude oil price was $ 90 = Rs 3900/-.

Now crude oil per barrel $ 75= Rs 5400/-.

8915 2018-09-12 05:49:16 I accept her health issues. Bt what abt olive oil, buffelo milk, buffelo milk curd??? Extra luxurious items?? I think mumo is a silent sponser of Biggboss this season
8916 2018-09-12 05:49:12 If it’s possible to take the middle apart and maybe put a drop or two of oil inside to lubricate it

8922 2018-09-12 05:48:13 Sucks that Hawaii is still overwhelmingly dependent on oil for electricity despite being so, uh, equatorial.
8923 2018-09-12 05:47:52 Investors in India are awaiting the release of consumer inflation data, which will probably show price pressures eased in August. The rupee may approach 73/dollar level following oil’s advance and as most Asian currencies are trading weaker.
8924 2018-09-12 05:47:41 Crude oil prices please.. Then we can definitely RT. Do take a course on how to read/plot graphs. Either you plot under ceteris paribus(other factors equal). Which are mostly not correct. So this is one example..
8925 2018-09-12 05:47:38 Get our troops out and put Erik prince in charge. We already got obl what are we really fighting for over there nothing! Well probably the oil! Oil has corrupted a lot of nations. That's why Bush went into Iraq in the first place, the 4 major banks in us controls the oil

8927 2018-09-12 05:47:14 I’m out. Costa Rica here I come. No oil on the pacific coast. As long as America doesn’t attack I know I’ll never face medical bankruptcy.
8928 2018-09-12 05:47:01 Oh. That one I have no idea on. It’s like the bulk oils at rainbow. Who knows how much a liter of oil or maple syrup weighs
8929 2018-09-12 05:46:55 Oil extended gains near $70 a barrel as shrinking crude inventories and slowing production growth in the U.S. raised fears of an impending supply crunch.

8935 2018-09-12 05:45:53 When I feel this way I always tell myself, "Yes, I feel this way now but tomorrow is a new day and you may feel differently." I always feel odd suggesting this, but it honestly helps me I've been taking CBD oil to help with the depression and the anxiety.
8936 2018-09-12 05:45:52 Oil ladies?
8937 2018-09-12 05:45:47 
8938 2018-09-12 05:45:47 It would have still taken place because the Saudi’s were mostly responsible for 9/11 attacks. From Bush to Obama to Trump somehow the Saudi’s keep getting away with anti-American rhetoric and ideology. Amazing what oil money can get you.
8939 2018-09-12 05:45:23 Portland at HH has proved oil flows in large quantities from the Weald, Kimmeridge at HH will be even bigger and BB when we return will be massive. It’s also great news for Holmwood Balcombe and Brockham

8947 2018-09-12 05:44:10 Went to pick up boat. Flat trailer tire. Changed tire but then electrical probs, low fuel and engine oil in truck . Lol always something. Rolling out solo tomorrow

8949 2018-09-12 05:43:40 Not necessarily. Cambodia has a low unemployment rate, but its inflation rate is increasing. Stable demand and supply, stable oil price and dollar exchange rate, and stable employment rate and purchasing power can control inflation. "Stable" is the magic word.
8950 2018-09-12 05:43:39 They say crude oil price increased,so the petrol diesel prices are shooting up.
But a year back, when the crude was $60 per barrel still the petrol diesel prices were on the increase.
And bjp minister Alphonse kannanthanam claims that this excess money is used to build toilets.

8952 2018-09-12 05:43:27 We are seeing this. Many simply are not computer savvy or sharp enough to get enough information. They trust the sharp dressed charismatic snake oil salesman cuz he speaks slowly and uses words they understand. Its heartbreaking to see them believe the bs the gop is spewing
8953 2018-09-12 05:43:23 Because the own oil, and because they buy our weapons?

8955 2018-09-12 05:42:56 In Iraq 1991, we guarded the burning oil fields on board the M1 Tank. It was our job......Kinda odd but it was what we did.
8956 2018-09-12 05:42:51 The night is almost over and the new day is coming. Yes so many things to do. At least I got one thing done and that was getting my car oil changed . Now the weekend is full with errands
8957 2018-09-12 05:42:49 Do you have any idea about which government give the authority to oil companies for deciding the diesel price?? It’s not UPA government 
8958 2018-09-12 05:42:32 Mr @Sir_Aziba of @Afr_Research joins me on @Smooth981FM for #BusinessExpress981 as we discuss oil prices, Q2 exports, bailout funds, and a bleak economic outlook for Nigeria from the @TheEIU_Africa and @HSBC
8959 2018-09-12 05:42:32 Indian rupee might touch eighty against dollar as Latin American and African countries are facing super recession in their currencies against dollar due to over dependent on oil like Venezuela .as the oil market price is not high as expected by OPEC countries

8975 2018-09-12 05:39:53 viewers will dismiss TV guests as being drunk when they don't agree with their sentiments, Yesterday Moses Kuria made some valid points which Dr. Awiti seemed to agree with. But the idea that it is patriotic to pay taxes is thoughtless, 16% VAT on oil excessively burdensome

8977 2018-09-12 05:39:19 The Canadian dollar rose against the US after U.S. PresidenT Trump boosted expectations of a trade deal and oil prices surged ahead of an hurricane. The JPY fell  amid a rebound in risk appetite as traders downplayed concerns that the U.S.-China trade rift was worsening.
8978 2018-09-12 05:39:19 Khartoum used oil rents from the South to develop the North and we called it exploitation, Kiir has bartered oil in Greater Upper Nile for roads construction in Equatoria and Bahr El Ghazal leaving the oil producing areas with polluted environment-what is this? #Regn chauvinism?
8979 2018-09-12 05:39:11 It is true that Russian seek control of the "center of the chessboard" same as US. But under Bush, Clinton, Obama, and others, US pursued control via destabilization whoch affected Russian oil based economy. In present day Trump and Putin seek to stabalize and share control

8986 2018-09-12 05:37:22 TGS to present at Pareto Securities' 25th Oil and Offshore Conference...
8987 2018-09-12 05:37:18 Most Asian currencies declined, led by the won and offshore yuan. South Korea’s currency fell and bonds rose after the nation’s jobless rate reached its highest level in more than eight years. The rupee was set to test record lows as oil prices climbed further.
8988 2018-09-12 05:37:17 Indian rupee is falling, crude prices are increasing and coal imports are increasing. If only shift to electric mobility powered by RE, we can reduce both oil and coal imports. But then it will put funny graph and meme creators out of business. hence its a difficult choice
8989 2018-09-12 05:37:16 Stop lying their were no Oil bond concept during Vajpayee's time...Oil bond were introduced during 2005-2006.

9000 2018-09-12 05:35:15 Buy a Deere...

In all seriousness, Kubotas are pretty good tractors but have higher maintenance costs on a per hour basis. They want motor oil changed every 200 hours and all other oils changed every 300 hours when most companies have engine oil intervals around 500.

9012 2018-09-12 05:33:07 The sad thing with this statistics is that the states with the highest federal disbursements actually led. Those states collect derivations Allocation, those oil producing state and yet failed woefully in producing sensible facilities for unemployment eradication

9020 2018-09-12 05:31:17 Love garlic oil pasta sauce! My brain still does not compute that you can make a pasta sauce without cream or tomato. Been using the food lab "3 garlic sauce" as a base, it's yummy!
9021 2018-09-12 05:31:16 I think now and then, about wanting an essential oil diffuser for my place. I would love my place to smell good, i believe in aromatherapy but i cannot stand chemical smells. They irritate me.

It’s barely tuesday :)
9031 2018-09-12 05:30:29 Plz also mention the range of crude oil prices during 2004-14, with yearly/ monthly averages and same data for 2014-18, saying things which are wanted and not the underlying data . Also always speak abt loan rates going down, plz speak abt historical lower PPF rates etc...

9097 2018-09-12 05:18:36 Exactly as written. The oil is emulsified right in and it's not at all oily (I'm with you on that). I think it mostly just thickens it up? I use it more as a random sauce on rice bowl creations instead of a salad dressing.

Issue - BJP failed to justify oil price hike. Poll results say the same.

9177 2018-09-12 05:05:46 I can’t wait to wash my car on Thursday and get it an oil change and tire rotation and get smelling good for our next road trip 
9178 2018-09-12 05:05:41 Not sure where you think from if you believe that current wars are to prevent another 911. We're fighting for oil , weapon manufacturers profits and Israeli interest.
9179 2018-09-12 05:05:38 普通に納得してしまった
9180 2018-09-12 05:05:23 I'm kidding. Buy some moisturizing shampoo & conditioner. And maybe some hair serum also? Like argan oil or Moroccan oil?
9181 2018-09-12 05:05:15 And by the way he did good when he applied GST nice ....but what about not putting oil and liquor under GST....is the only aim of govt is to collect more n more taxes form public
9182 2018-09-12 05:05:11 Oh no, it's nothing like oil. Oil is useful 
9183 2018-09-12 05:05:05 Good if you can add trend of crude oil ( a much decisive factor) within same. Our people keep wasting energy to defend their sides, instead it can contribute to some real assessments.
9184 2018-09-12 05:04:53 Get the oil lanterns that are sold in supermarkets and Walmart. Can get non-smoking wax oil. Can't recall name of oil but significantly safer than kerosene etc. Lanterns are under $15 and throw light. Never leave burning lantern unattended, especially around kids, dogs, cats.
9185 2018-09-12 05:04:48 ！！！！なるほど！！！
9186 2018-09-12 05:04:31 what about SP and BSP?they  were also same during their time?now it is bjp time and let the ppl cry,our govt/system/oil companies have no time to listen to ppl voice?
9187 2018-09-12 05:04:24 They did. Everyone did. But please share global crude oil price at 2013 and 2018 as well.

9232 2018-09-12 04:57:34 Look up rare earth mining and processing in China. The long term environmental impacts of “green tech” and “renewables” is far worse than oil, gas or nuclear. I’ll wait while you get informed

9256 2018-09-12 04:54:27 Another self goal by Congress. 

If % increase in crude oil prices, between 2004-14, was much higher than % increase in per liter price of petrol, who then paid for the deficit?

The common man! Cost of subsidy was pushed on to them for a later date. That is the root of the mess.
9257 2018-09-12 04:54:11 Remember all those years  PREPA bought oil sludge from Venezuela at high-grade oil prices and the difference in price was rumored to have been kicked back to the PREPA fuel office manager and corrupt government officials in PR.  $100's of millions of dollars per year- Total Scam

It's got very little to do with "us" other than we give it away for pennies off public land.

3.Colour comes out/bleeds when you wash it? Slather your hair in coconut oil before you wash it.

9301 2018-09-12 04:49:44 I totally agree with this. However, if the gov't really can't suspend the TRAIN Law or even just the excise tax on oil, I just hope that they could find a turnaround para maibsan yung inflation lalo na ang current trend ng oil price globally is high and is projected to be higher.

9584 2018-09-12 04:07:08 "Winning" with a "losing team" that takes money from Big Oil and the fracking industry is not a good thing, though, and both "major" parties do so. We're talking about our planet and our children's futures here. #DumpTheDuopoly #VoteGreen
9585 2018-09-12 04:06:55 As a Colorado resident what I know is that drilling around Rangely is more expensive than in other places. The oil boom elsewhere made drilling there economically unfeasible. It's called capitalism. But I'm sure your waitress was correct and literally everyone else is lying.

9618 2018-09-12 04:01:29 Because you’re over irritating your skin causing more oil production. So me a favor. Try oil cleansing for a week. With Sunflower oil. Massage it into the skin for 60-90 seconds then wipe off with a damp towel. See how your skin feels then.

Although, with #Scrote Morrison holding up a lump of coal in Parliament, one might think that the #insidiousIPA / #PuppetMasterMurdoch controlled #corruptLNP is in the pockets of big oil, coal and gas as well, particularly as they are generous donors to IPA.
9622 2018-09-12 04:00:40 Environment...but those pesky regulations that thwart business (aka job creators). Too many regulations that cost too much money for businesses.  How about restoring the fee/tax for the cleanup fund that oil/gas used to pay into to help clean their ‘oopses’?

9654 2018-09-12 03:55:13 Indeed, we need transparency to learn from this worrisome outage. The claims of gas being reliable in this kind of case are at stake. The quality of Heat Index prediction is too. The ability to switch on Oil peakers is also. Tnx for getting into the weeds. We have much to learn.

9721 2018-09-12 03:46:37 I grew up in Alaska. It doesn’t get more West than that, both geographically and in terms of “cowboys and indians” type stereotypes. Alaska was bought for military bases. Population boomed during Gold Rush. Oil, mining, fishing are the biggest industries.

9782 2018-09-12 03:39:00 Pretty pathetic if shale is already going to start contracting. The way people treat these oil equities, it almost feels like people have forgotten how hard it is to get a barrel of oil these days, let alone at an economic price and to keep it sustained. Those are ugly stats.
9783 2018-09-12 03:38:57 Mario, a country with debt in FOREIGN currency, that needs FOREIGN RESERVES to function, can get in deep trouble. VN needs import chem & equipmt for oil industry, plus food. Debt in foreign US $$.

9818 2018-09-12 03:34:55 This makes his “take the Iraq oil” comment make a little more sense. He just thinks the government has a public version of every private industry. “Why don’t we just create our own search engine?” This is how Propaganda TV starts, hah.

9848 2018-09-12 03:31:56 It seems more effective to crush demand for oil, which cities can do with a few clever tricks. 

The irony is that even if they successfully divest, by increasing oil demand with their transportation/housing policies, they make oil stocks *more attractive* for other investors!

9852 2018-09-12 03:31:28 Govt has banned offshore searching for oil and gas. Now banning derivative in form plastic bags to be followed by Tupper stuff + all latex products like single use surgical gloves and, and,---. Effective 1st April. Robbo thinks Cindy will alienate many voters +be pushing up hill.
9853 2018-09-12 03:31:09 Unless your using this for oil carts then it’s sad
9854 2018-09-12 03:30:59 Damn yo she couldn’t at least lather the lower half of her body with lotion or oil or something
9855 2018-09-12 03:30:42 You're wrong on everything. PET actually sunk tons of federal money into the oil sands. The feds even bought a 15% stake in Syncrude when their backers bailed.

9858 2018-09-12 03:30:39 It was great to be able to share our thoughts & ideas on the outlook for the oil & gas industry.
9859 2018-09-12 03:30:25  thats how i was with that witch hazel stuff .... but i use oil free acne wash , its orange
9860 2018-09-12 03:30:23 Bonanza for state governments as they are likely to close FY19 with tax revenues exceeding budget estimates by Rs.22,700 crore on the back of strong oil and weak rupee according to @TheOfficialSBI research note.
9861 2018-09-12 03:30:17 okay I haven't done a double-blind controlled trial here but coconut oil seems to work better for frying tofu in a cast iron skillet than vegetable/canola oil has in the past
9862 2018-09-12 03:30:00 Yes. These rescued cows deserve it. And we feed them only freshly chopped green grass and wheat bran and bit of oil cakes. That's it. Natural chemical free food for them
9863 2018-09-12 03:29:50 It's hard to do unless cities are directly investing in securities (rather than funds), which to my knowledge most cities don't do. So they have to ask fund managers to somehow strip out oil companies, which is hard, or find funds that have no exposure to oil, which is hard.

9865 2018-09-12 03:29:27 I don't think domestic production will be included in the state's emissions, but I've heard that many/most CA oil wells are on the razor's edge of profitability and will tip over if they lose CA as a customer -- so it may have the *effect* of shutting down much CA oil production.
9866 2018-09-12 03:29:05 Kemaren ada baca thread tp lupa thread punya siapa. Trs tdi pagi iseng dong hbs keramas trs rambut agak lembab dikasih oil yg dari lor3al. Eh beneran lembut bgt anjir. Berasa kyk abis dicatok disalon

9868 2018-09-12 03:28:55 How are state-based regulations that limit greenhouse gas emissions a disadvantage? The bottom line of the oil and gas industry is not most important. Protecting public health and preventing as much greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere as possible are more vital goals.

9874 2018-09-12 03:28:16 It's been almost two years to the day since I got bitten. At age 26. Just as I reached that point in life where things were coming together. And in a flash all gone will suffer forever. You know how it is. Oregano oil has helped. And at times CBD oil also. Hope we get through it
9875 2018-09-12 03:28:03 Best night! Cuddles with Jaxon as we watch a movie with stitch in it and getting some quality lavender oil inhaled. I think he’s feeling the benefits of the oils too.
9876 2018-09-12 03:28:01 I dunno. coconut oil fat?
9877 2018-09-12 03:27:57 Someone has predicted that WWIII will be battled for "oil", no idea who predicted and when. However, 2019 elections will be fought over Oil.
9878 2018-09-12 03:27:49 So I made this bomb ass after shower body oil:

9880 2018-09-12 03:27:43 Rub in olive oil and salt and bake for an hour. This is not a debate
9881 2018-09-12 03:27:38 2 of I do not really know how many pg.  ehormous damage done by oil ind. last more than lifetime. there is concrete scientific evidence to back this up. try going back to school to upgrade job shills, move on.
9882 2018-09-12 03:27:33 If you’re new to cannabis I would recommend trying CBD Oil or a sublingual spray. There’s lots of good ones to choose from. I’ve tried @Hydropothecary and @discoverOGI. 
9883 2018-09-12 03:27:15 Tar sands is a term used by the oil industry, then they rebranded.  Both terms are OK to use.
9884 2018-09-12 03:27:01 Because it’s not snake oil, but excellent nutritional supplements as hundrends of thousands of satisfied customers can attest.
As a holistic professional I know these supplements are superior quality & enhance health.
9885 2018-09-12 03:26:48 Because you don't want to believe that the government that you trust to keep you safe and secure would kill you to get to some mid-east oil...or gold...or property...etc., etc.
9886 2018-09-12 03:26:48 Thats why we invaded for more oil so  she can fry up extra bacon
9887 2018-09-12 03:26:35 Yup! No animal products at all (tho some people argue no bc they use palm oil which = deforestation which = displacing animal habitats so it kinda depends on how hxc you are)
9888 2018-09-12 03:26:25 Since 2012, there have been more jobs in renewable energy and clean tech than in oil and gas. Look to the future not the past. 3/5 of all the known reserves have to stay in the ground, bitumen is not making the grade. #divest #retrain

9898 2018-09-12 03:24:36 Cannabis has made me a more compassionate person. I all so give oil to those that feel it helps.  So: a compassionate person is going to be hung by non-compassionate people. I’m not sure we will ever get out of the hairless ape stage. It a load of bollocks.
9899 2018-09-12 03:24:35 1 of 1..I just read the first 2 paraghrafe of this letter. That woman must have had the help of the oil industry to put this letter together. The majority of Canadians do not support a distructive industry that only serves a small portion of the country.
9900 2018-09-12 03:24:28 this is the most witchy thing I’ll ever say but it’s so disgusting that if I don’t share, I’d being doing a disservice to myself... tonight when I went to go drink my marshmallow root lunar tincture, I accidentally drank my garlic ear oil, can u say GROSS

9902 2018-09-12 03:24:21 Thank you for your message!
I never knew that hot showers and most soaps make eczema worse. I'll be careful.
In addition, I will try to check about coconut oil.
I really appreciate your kindness.

9909 2018-09-12 03:22:54 5 years back I was at the mercy of Gas dealer for a cylinder. To day they are waiting at my gate with a cylinder. It is the UPA govt deregulated oil price. I hv a supermarket in my village “samruthi” loan got thru Mudra. I hv to believe wht i see or you?

9913 2018-09-12 03:22:18 On the rising prices of oil, the dogma of the Modi Government shows its double character. Farewell to the power of the Modi government, ignoring the misery of public in front of power, is the solution to the problems.

9914 2018-09-12 03:22:13 Time to release the oil reserves. A couple rounds of SPR would help before hurricane makes landfall.
9915 2018-09-12 03:21:57 I use vitamin e oil in lieu of a moisturizer. It has changed the game for me! I have oily skin, and it has balanced me out. I also used to have a few dry patches, my chin, my nose. Not so much anymore :)

9940 2018-09-12 03:18:54 Somehow I think the members of the American Petroleum Institute know what did and did not create the oil boom. I may not agree with them on much, but I doubt they think Cruz knows more about their business than they do.  He probably just lost more credibility with them.
9941 2018-09-12 03:18:49 @realDonaldTrump Happy anniversary today is 17 years since the self-attack on September 11, tell me that it feels to govern a country with a government that only invades oil and ruin or blame other countries as you do the United States is a disappointment only racism, xenophobia.
9942 2018-09-12 03:18:45 Yup. They have a special cream that whipes those stubborn pieces of oil which tend to stick in the skin or nails. I guess a mechanic would suit it best to touch you!

9944 2018-09-12 03:18:38 As a former McDonalds employee, I recommend getting fries at lunch time

Because they don't change the oil until the next morning, by dinner time, the oil can't reach the same temperature and they're no where near as crispy (oil is too starchy).
9945 2018-09-12 03:18:35 Add mozzarella balls, avocado, grape tomatoes, parmesean cheese, balsamic and olive oil. Salt and pepper to taste. It’s a collection of poems.

9947 2018-09-12 03:18:14 have you also forgotten that Trudeau is anti oil and trying to finish what papa Trudeau started back in the day which was killing off the oil and gas industry.   where am i wrong?
9948 2018-09-12 03:17:54 God can I please dig in my backyard and strike oil ??? 
9949 2018-09-12 03:17:49 Ofcourse we can. if we can decrease our dependence on luxuries then surely oil prices will not affect us much.

9964 2018-09-12 03:15:36 Ah, it's become clear.  Mother Elizabeth has convinced you.  Which makes sense, since a human rights lawyer that has no scientific training and rides the ferry to the Gulf Island while decrying the use of any oil derived fuel is  great mentor.
9965 2018-09-12 03:15:32 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
9966 2018-09-12 03:15:27 47000cr ka tha oil bond, wo 2017me pay hogya tha.
9967 2018-09-12 03:15:05 Maybe try some CBD oil, too? CBD is short for “Can’t Be Disabled”, so it’s for sure going to work.
9968 2018-09-12 03:14:51 ban diesel and petrol right.not palm oil.maybe in the future palm oil can subtitute petrol and diesel .who knows.
9969 2018-09-12 03:14:51 I definitely think so. My boyfriend eve thinks so, lol. The palettes that come in are pretty good. I’ve gotten good quality brushes too. Nail oil, face masks, lashes, makeup, eye masks, makeup tools... bunch of shit lol.

9971 2018-09-12 03:14:30 Yep I've seen that. Oil sands is the third most carbon intensive oil on earth when all the fuel burned to produce it is factored in.

We should keep it in Canada.
9972 2018-09-12 03:14:25 The future energy has to be electricity. When oil is disrupted by low cost electricity starting in 2021 world demand will drop causing a price fall that will leave high cost oil stranded (i.e.uneconomic) unless it can be converted into cheap power. #cdnecon
9973 2018-09-12 03:14:23 cocoa butter , coconut oil
9974 2018-09-12 03:14:22 Im not big on coffee but I just made the coffee scrub with brown sugar and coconut oil lorrrt it smells so good I can’t waiiit to use it 
9975 2018-09-12 03:14:16 US & Iran tension is giving Russia the chance to grab geopolitical control over oil market & thereby the global economic infrastructure.  This will give Russia a HUGE economic boost as the Ruble's heavily tied to Russian oil while weakening US bargaining power.
9976 2018-09-12 03:14:12 just because you have oil in your place
9977 2018-09-12 03:14:05 @DavidCayJ wrote a book about the charlatan 45 potus a few years ago, uncovering the truth about how he might have only around $200,000. That’s just about it. This snake oil salesman could only fool 2 groups; his base & the lily-livered, commie/Putin loving republicans.
9978 2018-09-12 03:14:05 I'll be there with Luke. I think we ha e tickets in the 100s. Ended up buying them from a STH friend. First time I've not sat in the nosebleeds at Lucas Oil.
9979 2018-09-12 03:14:00 natry ko lang yung chili oil nila kasi two christmases ago naka-encounter ako ng gift pack nila containing all the corned beef variants and other products like the chili oil, and pasta sauces
9980 2018-09-12 03:13:54 Good thing Russia is warning us about the fragile geopolitical situation which they are largely shaping and making even more fragile all over the world. #oil #Russia #Ukraine #Syria
9981 2018-09-12 03:13:51 #Crude, there is no refiner nor crude oil pipelines in North Caroline and people afraid the hurricane will wipe out their crude supply...what a BS story! #opec #oil #aramco
9982 2018-09-12 03:13:50 My history professor mentioned Oil City the other day and was like “yeah no one here knows where that is” and I was like”I do! I know people from there” my professor thought I was the best thing ever because of that...Miss you guys!! @SophiHutchi @lucy_hutch
9983 2018-09-12 03:13:38 Oil combating oil , a dream
9984 2018-09-12 03:13:33 When the weather is rainy like tonight instead of taking my meds for my #lupus I’m taking 5 drops of CBD Hemp Oil so I can sleep well and not wake up feeling stiff & achy in the morning.  #chronicpain #autoimmune
9985 2018-09-12 03:13:32 Release the oil reserves please
9986 2018-09-12 03:13:32 Taco Bell isn't even a proper restaurant. It's more like an Oil & Gas company....
9987 2018-09-12 03:13:29 Russia warns Fenella Fielding 'fragile' oil market due to geopolitics, but says it can raise output
9988 2018-09-12 03:13:22 the wheel smells like oil and grease and car stuff
the leaf smells like big ass manly trees and shit
the axe smells like aggression
9989 2018-09-12 03:13:22 i swear every time something is wrong kaelyn always whips out some sort of essential oil that will help you
9990 2018-09-12 03:13:19 おれもさ、ﾄﾞﾊﾞｧと行きたい日もあるわけよ。。
9991 2018-09-12 03:13:04 You’re awesome Emma, “maintain the rage” as a legendary PM once said.  The squeaky wheel gets the oil. As I saw recently on this forum, we men are lucky women only want equality and not revenge. 
9992 2018-09-12 03:12:47 Son.. Im just lost how a whole bottle of vegetable oil is missing..
9993 2018-09-12 03:12:46 i think i’m just destined to have a semi dry scalp but i do coconut oil masks weekly so it balances out
9994 2018-09-12 03:12:36 Depends. Back during the oil embargo when gas was 3+ a gal and long lines at stations I bought 200 cans of coleman lantern fuel (unleaded gas) including the can for .89 plus state sales tax. there was no fed or state fuel tax.
9995 2018-09-12 03:12:31 This or running CPC under losses. And we don't dig oil. What do you prefer?
9996 2018-09-12 03:12:27 Protect the world? You mean rob some oil?
9997 2018-09-12 03:12:07 @yemialadee does your slap smell like hot oil
9998 2018-09-12 03:12:06 @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls release the oil reserves! Gas is way too high and a hurricane is coming.
9999 2018-09-12 03:12:05 How much a oil change cost?
10000 2018-09-12 03:11:58 まぁね！僕も大層失敗して毎度怒られてきたクチでありますから、OILさんには頭が上がらんであります。
10001 2018-09-12 03:11:53 Cruz has to go to big oil money for help. Beto goes to the people. Who's the real elitist?
10002 2018-09-12 03:11:46 It is 10:11PM, my teeth are brushed and flossed, my face is cleansed, toned, serumed, masqued, and moisturized, my eyelashes are brushed and cleansed, Grissom got his CBD oil, my windows are open, and I am READY to pass tf out.
10003 2018-09-12 03:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza for dinner today will be: soggy crust with damp coconut oil and ham.
10004 2018-09-12 03:11:01 Never coconut oil. More like almond-apricot and argan 
10005 2018-09-12 03:10:54 Had to look up Pico de Gallo. The Turks might leave out the peppers but then add diced cucumbers and some olive oil and call it "Shepherd's Salad" (Çoban Salata). A three-fingered pinch of bread dipped or soaked in the juices is transcendent.
10006 2018-09-12 03:10:53 When I was 17 and staying with my bestie (parents away) we set the kitchen on fire cooking popcorn. The Firemen were hot hot hot. BTW, that old thing about never throwing water on an oil fire? I can confirm it's a v v v bad idea.
10007 2018-09-12 03:10:45 Wait, what, fish oil? What did I miss? I thought we needed our omega 3's? You mean that from now on  when I eat bluefish burgers at John's Fish Market I won't be being heart -healthy, I'll just be eating an awesome sandwich?
10008 2018-09-12 03:10:40 팔로안된사람 멘션같은거 안보게 설정하신듯
10009 2018-09-12 03:10:34 If you believe Woody’s Book of Lies, I’ve got lots of snake oil to sell ya!
10010 2018-09-12 03:10:34 NYT: "Cuba, which is dependent on Venezuela for oil and has close relations with Mr. Maduro, should be encouraged to use its leverage."

10013 2018-09-12 03:10:18 Its a great idea to keep a light but rich olive oil cake on hand at all times
10014 2018-09-12 03:10:15 油を固めて捨てるの面倒でしょう？僕に渡してくれたらいいよ。あ、固めて渡してくれてもいいよ。
