1 2018-09-11 23:49:12 My personal view is that it’s less about bad incentives and more about short termism. Moneyball strategies won’t pay off for 4-6 years, beyond most deans’ horizons. Short-term strategies (overpaying for known commodities) “pay off” right away but mortgage the future.

-lack of action on soaring prices of basic commodities isn't Malasakit
You're right we need genuine leaders not hypocrites.

11 2018-09-11 22:07:01 Definitely agree in Canada’s sake. Just no money coming into Canada until things resolve, and China could devalue their currency further at any time. Feels a bit like playing hot-potato to me right now even though Canadian commodities are incredibly low priced right now.
12 2018-09-11 22:02:14 I'm feeling the exact same way. Even if we bounce, I don't see it being a sustained move higher. Until there is clear resolution on the trade war front, I don't think the pressure on commodities subsidies.

34 2018-09-11 21:30:18 Gundlach: 'Commodities are really volatile, If you own commodities, you will have to be able to live with the drawdowns. I think commodities should stay in the portfolio.'

36 2018-09-11 21:19:06 All things are commodities under capitalism. The point is to de commodify it.
37 2018-09-11 21:07:39 Those r all commodities&their value is based on fed.res. notes.If the person ur dealin w/is willing to accept ur beanie baby as tender for say 5 dollars of gas then u both will hav a legal transaction.If ur gas store clerk wont accept ur beanie baby as tender u will not get it.~
38 2018-09-11 21:07:11 Gundlach still bullish on commodities.
39 2018-09-11 21:06:16 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
40 2018-09-11 21:01:47 That's not true sir,  even if my mind fixed it can be unfixed by the visible things I see. Sir  this government make more noise than any other administration, the cost of commodities is still raising, even now bread sellers are planning to increase their prices.
41 2018-09-11 21:00:00 Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) #agricultural commodities traded lower on Tuesday morning, with wheat futures falling on weak demand for US supplies.
42 2018-09-11 20:51:53 People raise their commodities as their income rises. Check gapminder for statistical data or dollar street to find out how people live at different incomes.
43 2018-09-11 20:47:20 Interesting. While I agree they are not securities, I dont know of I would personally consider them pure commodities either. Crypto needs specific laws I think.

54 2018-09-11 19:59:31 Stock piling stocks of cocoa and sugar? Those famous European commodities.
55 2018-09-11 19:58:02 Trading commodities in the office, watching the tragedy on tv. Unbelievable.... Went home on public transport, all people on the tube were talking to each other. I will never forget that day.
56 2018-09-11 19:54:33 I don't know about their political power, but I do trade commodities, and soy and corn alone, are worth about 5 times what all the meats are worth combined.
57 2018-09-11 19:49:56 So according to Hon. Moses Kuria, 16% VAT on fuel doesn't affect the price of basic commodities like unga and bread.

I need to go back to school.@HusseinMohamedg @citizentvkenya @KBonimtetezi #NewsNight
58 2018-09-11 19:49:11 the commodities will be transported using bicycles and donkey carts
59 2018-09-11 19:39:50 Kibaki built Thika super highway without increasing any VAT on fuels or basic commodities,  at the same period we experienced a +ve growth in overall development so @citizentvkenya tell Moses Kuria atoe bangi studio apeleke statehouse wakuvute na his fellows.
60 2018-09-11 19:39:16 A Baking Company, by Product Scope, Produces A Consumption Good, that generally has an EXPIRY due to it's Perishable Nature. On the CEO Level. I also know COMMODITIES. They are FORWARD SPOT Contracts on THE OPEN MARKET.
61 2018-09-11 19:38:24 The issue is not about VAT on basic commodities but the spiral effect of VAT on fuel to such commodities. There is a marginal effect on their costs, which producers pass to the consumer.
62 2018-09-11 19:37:35 So far has the price of any of those commodities gone up since effective of the 16%
The country has to raise revenue n part of it n most of it is trough taxation n reinvesting in non recurrent expensive rather than capital or development so that the economy can be sustainable
63 2018-09-11 19:34:25 This is Kenya. Starting from the manufacturers to the retailers, they gonna take advantage of the fuel tax to hike the prices of those commodities.
64 2018-09-11 19:30:55 Does Moses know exactly what he is/was saying? VAT on fuel translates to an increase in the price of everything, including zero-rated commodities.
65 2018-09-11 19:30:26 Let’s face it in true dimension we are here to learn from each other if the fuel price affect the production of zero rated goods it is by law that one can file for deductions while submitting the returns hence the prices of basic commodities remain the same
66 2018-09-11 19:28:48 Kuria is dumb! He said the price of commodities shouldn't change cause of a fuel tax
67 2018-09-11 19:24:18 The issue is not about VAT on basic commodities but the spiral effect of VAT on fuel to such commodities. There is a marginal effect on their costs, which producers pass to the consumer.
68 2018-09-11 19:22:57 Mosese Kuria reasoning is just normal and perfect. In fact he's considered among the most intelligent among his JAP peers with high IQ than the rest including pres Uhuru. 16% added VAT on petroleum product has no impact on Other commodities since they're not related. What!
69 2018-09-11 19:22:02 Breakevens do not represent a floor, neither in bitcoin nor commodities. I don't predict levels. Year low is 5750 and I believe it will break lower based on both technicals and fundamentals.
70 2018-09-11 19:20:53 Gone and forgotten... RBs are among the most replaceable commodities in football...
71 2018-09-11 19:17:25 Very true basic commodities are zero rated and if there is tax in there process one can file for returns for it to be deducted on their monthly or yearly returns
72 2018-09-11 19:16:46 On the other hand those that don’t vote labour have no idea how stupid they are being..to vote for any other party would be to vote against your own interest exactly what the Tories & the MSM want, like little brainwashed commodities they can rip off..
73 2018-09-11 19:15:22 If you impose VAT on fuel all basic commodities will rise thus rise in inflation...simple roadside logic
74 2018-09-11 19:13:43 Nonsense!!! There are expired commodities in the shops and as expected the shop's can't stand the competition, it's only the consumers that lose at the end of day with no one to the rescue
75 2018-09-11 19:12:26 HAPO UMETUCHENGA SISI KAMA WATU WA MLEMBE..WHEN FUEL PRICES GO UP KUNA SOME OTHER COMMODITIES THAT INCREASE IN PRICES.
76 2018-09-11 19:12:08 Let's live within our means, period, mega project for who and for what?? MEGA PROJECT for Wanjiku who can't afford basic commodities  #NoVoting
77 2018-09-11 19:12:06 we are not refusing to pay taxes. What Kenyans are against is high, exploitative taxes on important commodities such as fuel. High taxes just signals a country which is trying to tax itself into prosperity, a ridiculous move.
78 2018-09-11 19:11:01 Mr. Kuria should know that the commodities he is talking about are no longer zero rated but are rather exempt. What this means is that you can't claim input VAT like before which will make their finished products more expensive.
79 2018-09-11 19:10:27 May God see you through the people that voted for this idiot called Moses Kuria. ,Even an illiterate knows that fuel is the mother of all commodities ,once the price shoots up  everything else goes up.#NewsNight
80 2018-09-11 19:04:42 I never expected to hear anything about zero rating so far, Moses ata mtoto wa primary aneza piga hesabu, VAT on fuel means VAT on all commodities,,,,it's a cost push inflation read this game of price must be stopped
81 2018-09-11 19:03:29 Economically when there is an increase in the cost of production,the prices of other basic commodities will rise automatically.#Lets reason from economic perspectives not development agenda perspective?
82 2018-09-11 19:02:22 Ideas:
Carbon as the new agricultural commodity
Carbon banks

Trade offs between pragmatism and seeing people's culture, livelihoods and identity as commodities appearing as the conversation evolves at @Low2No #GCAS
83 2018-09-11 19:02:06 This action seems more than appropriate ! Why in HELL should we send aid whether financial, medical or commodities to any country who attack us or our allies !
We should have a branch of the Whitehouse dedicated to sending Go To Gell wishes from all of Us !!!
84 2018-09-11 19:00:31 I'm listening to @HonMoses_Kuria and wondering if the alcohol causd his brain to commit suicide or something . Saying that increasing the price of fuel has no effect on the price of other commodities like cereals, and he claims he's an expert on taxation.
85 2018-09-11 18:58:44 tax on fuel won't affect prices of commodities??!! OMG. fools carry themselves indeed
86 2018-09-11 18:58:25 Listen to this guy talk as if those commodities will walk by themselves to your kitchen  who elects this guy anyway 
87 2018-09-11 18:56:40 @HusseinMohamedg please redirect this show! Moses Kuria has made my wife to wake up furiously like hell! Don't talk about taxation of basic commodities which we are already being taxed! @HonMoses_Kuria please we are talking on fuel which affects everything!
88 2018-09-11 18:55:34 Mr President we are calling on you to review downward the forex to bring down prices of essential commodities, PDP will take you by surprise soon by instigating bakery association to increase prises of bread nation wide to bring you down. You better do something

90 2018-09-11 18:54:36 is this how moses kuria has a degree in bcom were there is a whole course unit about taxation and taxable commodities
91 2018-09-11 18:53:27 ..price their products at globally benchmarked index. Sadly, this crucial economic reform came at th fag end of UPA regime. 

I have firmly believed that India should never subsidise imported commodities at th cost of Taxpayers' money and fiscal prudence...

92 2018-09-11 18:51:51 you ever forget that you're not barred from all the commodities of the world and all you need to do is get a job so you can earn money to purchase goods and services

hi my names cooper and i have one dollar
93 2018-09-11 18:51:36 I think VAT should be applied across all commodities instead of imposing it on a single commodity. 
The VAT can be lowered down to something like 6-8%
94 2018-09-11 18:51:17 One other Woodward nugget: Trump offered Gary Cohn the post of Energy Secretary. No interest, according to Woodward. "You trade commodities," Trump said. "Why don't you think about being secretary of energy?"
95 2018-09-11 18:50:17 Truly horrible. Smarter than 3 year old people and treated like meaningless commodities
96 2018-09-11 18:49:04 @citizentvkenya tell moses kuria that even if the president  needs to carry out his development  agenda it is unfair to over tax citizens.. Instead he should find other ways to raise money not by over taxing commodities.. #NewsNight @HusseinMohamedg
97 2018-09-11 18:48:51 Moses Kuria says 16% VAT on fuel doesn't affect the price of basic commodities like unga and bread.  He's either drunk or I am. #newsnight

99 2018-09-11 18:46:53 Moses kuria should sober up first. An increase in fuel prices will automatically raise the cost of production hence the increase in price of commodities
100 2018-09-11 18:46:41 hon kuria my basic knowledge in business studies dictates that if cost of production increases so does the commodities
101 2018-09-11 18:46:04 Moses kuria we conquer with you that basic commodities are zero rated, do you mean that the same  commodities are not affected by an increase in cost of  production @citizentvkenya
102 2018-09-11 18:46:00 Moses Kuria: There is no VAT on maize floor and wheat flour. The basic commodities are zero-rated. 

Even if the VAT is implemented on fuel, the basis consumption products are zero-rated. What would we say if there was VAT on unga? FACT
103 2018-09-11 18:45:40 I'm listening to Moses Kuria and wondering if his brain committed suicide or something . Saying that increasing the price of fuel has no effect on the price of other commodities like cereals, and he claims he's an expert on taxation. What grade did he score?
104 2018-09-11 18:45:14 I totally agree with you @KBonimtetezi the spiral effect results to inflation..all commodities prices will increase. Can we find something else to tax or work on cutting on wastages to raise that money
105 2018-09-11 18:42:59 @HusseinMohamedg @citizentvkenya Kindly ask my friend @HonMoses_Kuria If food commodities are zero rated, is food stuff distribution zero rated? Won't the fuel increase affect the same?
106 2018-09-11 18:42:53 @citizentvkenya @HusseinMohamedg Moses Kuria's reasoning cannot be matched. How can you not relate the effect on the prices of commodities to the higher taxation on fuel. Common sense is not common to everyone
107 2018-09-11 18:41:11 Hahah you don't know what you're talking about.  Labor is an expense and not on the balance sheet unless it's accrued. Plenty of companies have commodities as assets. And a great number of economists disagree whether labor is a commodity.
108 2018-09-11 18:37:42 @citizentvkenya @HusseinMohamedg Moses Kuria always say 'punda amechoka' leo ametuchenga punda. Bt the truth is 16% VAT will affect over 50% commodities prices.
109 2018-09-11 18:37:01 None of it has anything to do with Brexit, it’s common business practice.
Happens in many industries where the raw materials are subject to the commodities market. 
Regularly ccured in my own industry of Ali extrusions resulting in car parks full of aluminium billets.
110 2018-09-11 18:36:26 Essential commodities like maize flour, bread etc were zero-rated but impose VAT on products directly involved in production of this commodities..This will be  a burden to common mwanachi
111 2018-09-11 18:32:14 #NewsNight @HusseinMohamedg I want @KBonimtetezi to raise this point once again and make it clear  that instead of taxing fuel at 16% why don't they slash the tax rate to maybe 10% or even 12% on all commodities  which will at least be affordable to all Kenyans. @citizentvkenya
112 2018-09-11 18:31:16 ....can you imagine not seeing the previous price of any other investment? stocks or bonds or commodities...and then have to pay 5% of the value of the asset when selling...?

116 2018-09-11 18:28:28 I had to stop listening when this Crowder guy called health care and college "commodities" as opposed to public goods. Crowder is an idiot, and Jim Carrey's comments on this topic are quite sane to anyone responsible enough to care about society.

120 2018-09-11 18:02:00 I think it will have much less political cost than what the BJP opponents like to believe. People realise that prices of multiple commodities have come down as well and most importantly everybody knows that the fuel excise money is being put to good use.

128 2018-09-11 17:33:27 @PM_Narendermodi The government has never shown any interest in controlling the rise in school/college education fees, rise in the prices of the essential commodities, solving the kashmir issue, pattidar reservation issue
129 2018-09-11 17:31:36 That’s too simplistic an explanation because the UK doesn’t export many commodities. It has to import material in order to create things to export. That negates the positive impact of a lower pound, which is why exports have increased yet growth has been lower
130 2018-09-11 17:25:02 Sir pl make statements on very sensitive issue of high price of essential commodities and petroleum product. Sir you are not looking serious on the basic issue touching to common man. You as PM of our country looting our own citizen everywhere and everytime

Si ahora compramos materia prima al exterior
133 2018-09-11 17:12:30 Homebuyers, drinkers, supermarket shoppers are paying very different prices around your constituency too. Why aren’t odd same in all betting shops? Even for commodities, prices vary by time/location so who’s to say which is correct? Not you, I’d hazard!

#Econ101
134 2018-09-11 17:07:40 Mentira, los commodities pegan el salto en 2004, para despues incrementar la suba hasta 2008. Lavagna recibio un superavit fiscal inmensno producto de la licuacion del GP tras 2002, y junto con Nielsen, hicieron una pesima reestructuracion de la deuda.
135 2018-09-11 17:06:22 Petrol affects middle class, which is mostly opinionated and less likely to change. Price of onion, tomato, potatoes under check. If the govt can convince d beneficiaries of the above commodities well by door to door, then 2004 won’t be repeated despite high oil price.
136 2018-09-11 17:06:03 I just hope you drive a petrol car instead of a diesel one.. diesel is provided at subsidised rates to keep a check on inflation of daily use commodities..People believe in govt. and their intent to collect taxes on petrol as it may help in reducing traffic thus pollution...

But, in medium to long term, all correlations broke, huge divergences across all asset classes, especially between the EM currencies & the US equities, and between the commodities vs US equity
139 2018-09-11 16:55:17 I couldn't agree with you more on this, instead we should tax it at 40%, do away with tax exemptions on basic commodities currently pegged on the same. Tuko pamoja

Rest all d political commodities i.e. Aaloo, kanda, dal, data are cheaper now. @ReallySwara like n RT
142 2018-09-11 16:31:18 Otra cosa, el campo gano guita porque los precios de los commodities subieron. Lo unico q hizo el gobierno kirchnerista fue subirle los impuestos y decirle a la sociedad q ellos tenian la culpa de q nos vaya mal cuando era todo lo contrario. Hay que ver numeros, no ideologia.
143 2018-09-11 16:30:26 O sea q el campo es el responsable de q no haya industrias en Argentina? Q tiene q ver el campo con q no haya Pymes? No tendran que ver las politicas economicas? Argentina no tiene industria hace decadas, no entiendo pq ahora q subieron los commodities la culpa la tienen ellos.
144 2018-09-11 16:28:45 I had keenly followed Indian demonetization and people over there faced lot of difficulties. Lack of cash flow caused shortage of edibles and other commodities. It won't work while we have prize bonds worth Rs.40k and Rs.15k each
145 2018-09-11 16:27:18 It’s great to have another woman sitting at @UNCTAD’s management table. Welcome to the team, Pamela @CokeHamilton , the new director of our international trade and commodities division @UNCTADKituyi
146 2018-09-11 16:23:51 You have given up on yourself and the future, I am worth the biscuits, if they increase it you will still complain things are hard in the country, buh dis are one of the commodities we should crave for, still u re bringing us down, black slavery thinking
147 2018-09-11 16:19:00 We are gonna be okay. The fine imposed on minimum balance and withdrawals from our bank account, and inhuman price rise in all commodities, will recover those monies.
148 2018-09-11 16:18:46 And murder 25 million people since WW2 who had no part in aggression against America. And pillage the commodities of commodity rich Nations.. when that doesn’t work. Tariffs, sanctions.. whatever can feed the profligacy of the 4th Reich is fai game.

150 2018-09-11 16:09:20 US can't compete until USD monopoly ends.  Why I've been advocating that the USD losing its monopoly on pricing oil & commodities & it's use as primary rsv currency will result in US & global econ strength, not weakness.  US govt protectionism of USD status hurt US for decades.
151 2018-09-11 16:07:36 Gold money w/o loans, credit & maxinv(returnxcshflw), the first antifa accounting tool, must be the only way to keep inequality just & rentiers out of usury w/o devolving to a planned/paper money economy.

154 2018-09-11 16:06:34 Agreed.

156 2018-09-11 16:06:00 Competition is a good thing.  This is why I have been advocating ending the USD's monopoly in the pricing of commodities & oil, and it's primary reserve status.  Allowing currency competition will be great for US, world economy (but bad for USD monopolists).
157 2018-09-11 16:04:45 Agreed.

166 2018-09-11 15:40:40 Important point (though not the one I think ours trying to make). The biggest component of nearly every strategy is being long Tbills (indirectly the inflation rate). For some reason the crowd understands this with futures strats like commodities but not individual assets.
167 2018-09-11 15:39:31 Always in history. Present no comment on increased price of petrol diesel cooking gas and all essential commodities.
168 2018-09-11 15:36:08 Only price of petrol,  diesel , Cooking gas and all essential commodities touched to sky .Unemployment on peak. This is the result of 4 years.
169 2018-09-11 15:30:59 From where would come any unstability? Where is the risk? 
People such as @Ahmadinejad1956 are persecuded in the regimes such as IRI which claim to be 100% anti-US! Seriousely?
Russia is feigning hostitily towards the US but their are close partners in weapon&commodities markets!
170 2018-09-11 15:26:59 The questioning comes from 'analogous'. It's as easy to say in this regard Bitcoin is as predictable as much it is scarce - and there are rarer (more scarce) metals than gold.

In the financial sense - in context - Gold is unlike other commodities; in that it exists in contango.
171 2018-09-11 15:23:41 I don't play that today. I am buying other commodities.
172 2018-09-11 15:19:30 Gold and Silver both nearing their 52-week low. Is this the time to buy precious metals or should we wait till they begin to bounce back? Thursday will be a good discussion about how to tackle commodities and precious metals #OSIF18FA
173 2018-09-11 15:19:12 I think I wanna do the JSE from next year. commodities & currencies have been dull for last 6 months or so
174 2018-09-11 15:14:32 That doesn't mean we're overpopulated that just means a lot of people choose to live in the same place.

We produce enough food, commodities, have enough space to comfortably care for many more people.
175 2018-09-11 15:13:12 But I get your point, that humans (women) aren't commodities whose value deplete with age, 

But if we go down to biology, it's a whole different thing.

177 2018-09-11 15:11:30 @sunnyohhk Bear market fear mongering on the rise, yet gold prices continue to fall. Leads me to think analysts don't believe what they put out. Commodities are looking strong, could be a better safe haven.

182 2018-09-11 14:56:35 A commodity backed cuurency could be easy to implement in a small economy!
But at a global level, for instance trade between large coutries it is hard to implement & coordinate!
Also the authority which issues the currency must hold the commodities hedging its currency. But how?

187 2018-09-11 14:47:05 Even then he sewed the seeds of Canada's current problems - a housing bubble generated by lax lending criteria, leading to the risk of recapitalization being required should the real economy take a sudden hit. Given over-reliance on selling commodities to China, could happen
188 2018-09-11 14:42:26 The monsters at the heart of this cover up need to be prosecuted to ensure it doesn’t happen again! And @NazShahBfd owes these girls an apology after saying they needed to remain silent for the sake of diversity. These are humans being treated like commodities
189 2018-09-11 14:39:17 Five world currencies strongly influenced by the global price of commodities are the Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Russian Ruble, Colombian Peso, & Peruvian Sol.
190 2018-09-11 14:39:02 Crypto-commodities are alt-base money, M1 (there's no M0 since there's no Fed/Commercial bank tier) 

Exchange credit/LN receipts are M2, which will expand from paper BTC products.

You hedge that, e.g. BTC on BitMex short swaps, and dollarize (or Yen-ize ect.) to M3.
191 2018-09-11 14:36:58 We can have competing currencies backed by many different commodities. Today you can sell a silver quarter for the silver content for $3.50. Please tell me how a fiat currency is better.

193 2018-09-11 14:29:53 Bhai fruits and vegetables ke price bhi petrol aur diesel ke price se related hai. Import / carrying becomes expensive. The cultivation also becomes expensive as the carrying cost of seed, fertilizer goes up. Same applies to other commodities as well.
194 2018-09-11 14:29:18 Pretty amazing turnaround for Lycopodium $LYL since the big commodities sell off in 2015. The Perth based engineering group is up 307% since the 2015 low and that's with a current 6.59% fully franked dividend.

211 2018-09-11 13:30:44 US cannot avail to lose the BPO's in the Philippines becoz once the Philippines turned them down,this will bring inflation to basic services and commodities in the US as they hv to pay dollars for Americans and may lead  their collapse and China will boom.

221 2018-09-11 13:03:54 If we are honest, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that inequalities in wealth create situations where people are reduced to commodities #stevewilkens#inequality#wealth#people
222 2018-09-11 12:58:53 Art, music, even sports too in some places. Seems like well-rounded education went out the window when  “No Child Left Behind” introduced the idea of overtesting & focused on the tests exclusively.

223 2018-09-11 12:52:49 It might not be specific to LinkedIn, but LinkedIn, in my opinion, promotes that culture even more. Imagine you can scour for “commodities” in an instant and not make any meaningful connection?
224 2018-09-11 12:50:36 Most job offers from LinkedIn come from recruiters, often from outside the company, and I think it’s a barrier. It makes candidates commodities and clients cash machines. 

It’s difficult to build genuine interests…
225 2018-09-11 12:49:20 HA?! Ayun yung lahat ng basic commodities ay nilalagyan na ng taxes. Yung Softdrinks, Coffee, Oil, etc., may taxes na sila. Ayun yung Package 1. Yung Package 2, hindi ako sure kung ano na yung Scope...

248 2018-09-11 11:43:10 Didn't address on how to solve the more important issues like inflation and high prices of basic commodities:(
249 2018-09-11 11:38:47 Sir there are various factors when commodities become expensive, the major one out of those is Speculation and hoarding. Now both of these have been stopped because of GST, Eway billing and transparency. GST has further made them cheaper and fuel price component is too small here
250 2018-09-11 11:37:18 Poor start for the stock indexes today, and waiting for the $250 Billion tariff announcement on China. Stocks are ready for a sell-off. If short the indexes-stay short. Expecting bad days ahead! But use protective stops.  #Commodities #Stocks #Dow #Invest
251 2018-09-11 11:36:12 My favorite part of that neighborhood (which is next to my agency's Chicago office): Ceres bar in the Board of Trade building. Like stepping into the 80s: diner-looking joint full of commodities traders getting hammered on massive after-work gin and tonics.
252 2018-09-11 11:33:51 Dear Mr.Uniyal.  Definitely Manmohan Singhji told at the time of PM that money is not grow in tree. But he himself controlled the price rise of commodities and petrol and diesel. Why our elected government failed to control. Can you give any answer?  You can only blame others.
253 2018-09-11 11:33:06 Mucha fórmula. Más fácil, seguí las economías regionales y expo de specialties y no commodities. Si aumentan, la devaluación fue efectiva. Caso contrario, es posible que haya quedado neutralizada por situación en los socios comerciales
254 2018-09-11 11:24:11 Dear Inferior, you need to do some research as to who promoted and supported the idea that anyone could easily obtain a mortgage with minimal income verification and the subsequent selling of these worthless commodities in the mortgage market. Can you say Democrat?
255 2018-09-11 11:22:21 A socialist view of women's rights respects her ownership over her own reproductive rights in the fullest expression of her womanhood. That means resisting facilitation that exploits them by off-the-shelf access to abortion clinics that reduces mother & child to mere commodities
256 2018-09-11 11:17:33 When the market is down I stop trading #Crypto and focus on #ForexMarket, #Commodities and more transitional financial products.

257 2018-09-11 11:16:09 I doubt this EM weakness is secular. I am a buyer of commodities firms at these prices. ANTO, RIO etc.
258 2018-09-11 11:14:25 There is always the chance of EM having a problem if the world has a manufacturing recession. Could make a trade war related argument, but commodities are in a tightening supply cycle (except for oil) so this weakness in commodities is unlikely to persist imo.

294 2018-09-11 08:24:59 Increase in diesel cost will lead to transport cost and all commodities. Your logistics cost will go up . Your example will be ok only for those who are getting reimbursements from employers or from clients like advocates audiand consultants .
295 2018-09-11 08:23:19 People put a lot of commodities into storage in anticipation for higher prices in the future. Yet no one calls these volumes "surplus". How is the situation in the ETS different?

307 2018-09-11 07:12:39 In grass-root economics, a sign that things are getting better, is when the price of commodities becomes more affordable..

323 2018-09-11 06:24:23 Reduction in budgeted tax on petrol leads to loss of revenue, which need to be compensated from another one... Which may lead to increase in price of other commodities... So, it is a tricky situation for GOI. Let's see the next move from GOI...

326 2018-09-11 06:00:45 1) Information is power, especially when compromising information is held over the heads of politicians and officials. These kind are targeted with bribes, and then extorted for having accepted bribes. In this manner they become commodities that are bought and sold by evil men.

339 2018-09-11 04:50:55 I am a fan of allowing prices of basic commodities and fuel to rise AFTER a disaster strikes. This serves several purposes. Mainly it gives incentive to provide those things in a disaster area.  It also discourages the black market in these things after a disaster strikes.

341 2018-09-11 04:43:11 RESUMO DOS CANDIDATO DISQUERDA 

Ciro: o canto da sereia de Keynes (+ "o agro é pop")
Haddad: não ganha nem eleição de síndico quer ser presidente
Boulos: é o lulismo sem commodities (ou votos)
Vera: quer fazer propaganda da revolução na eleição, mas n sei como pq ngm conhece ela
342 2018-09-11 04:36:54 Public wants respectful life let government be full tight. Essential commodities r beyond reach, still they claim to be right... Umesh
343 2018-09-11 04:34:53 Curious as to why exactly you view trading currency as unethical. Do you view trading between all assets/commodities as unethical?
344 2018-09-11 04:30:04 Because of inflation..... price increase of all basic commodities, transportation, electricity, water.... hay hindi na makahinga..........
345 2018-09-11 04:28:54 Yes,  to the jubilee supporters who are buying fuel and other commodities at better rates.  Kumira kumira
346 2018-09-11 04:21:31 BULLLLLSHIT you can’t blame this on Femdom content or lack of control. It’s that you truly don’t respect women and just see them as commodities to wank to ... NEXT ...
347 2018-09-11 04:14:05 Sir, i am in a profession whr our one leg is india n others in European/US countries.
But i still care abt middle class Indian.
Am i a position where i shud not care abt any price hike on any commodities.
Being Indian is more important to me then being Individual.
348 2018-09-11 04:05:55 sim, mas as leis criadas na época  vieram a trazer resultado anos depois com um controle da inflação!Lula nao queria seguir o plano do ultimo gov mas viu que tava começando a dar certo e deu continuidade, tirando que ainda contou com commodities e expansão da economia mundial!

350 2018-09-11 04:03:11 Sir, I would argue that gold has lost a lot of relevance as a safe haven with the advent of Cryptos. Cryptos behave more like commodities, they are widely accepted and are easier to carry around.
351 2018-09-11 04:03:00 plano real foi em 93, país seguiu no caos até 2003, teve muita política de inclusão, aumento de renda pras classes baixas e muita sorte com os commodities. Mas muita cagada tb. :(
352 2018-09-11 04:00:59 Finally, the Masterwork economy needs to be looked at for infusion, only have MW cores a requirement if the weapon/armour is FULLY Masterworked, if not then just increase the other commodities required to infuse. These are my only negatives for the DLC so BZ guys!
353 2018-09-11 04:00:53 It was no accident, Harald knows. Commodities have to be controlled by the Treasury ESF because out system is so fragile. Lowest volatility I can ever remember in commodities which is by design w no Uptick Rule being a critical piece along with deep captured regulators, collusion
354 2018-09-11 04:00:29 It has nothing to do with religion. China is investing in nepal on insane amount and also providing nepal with cheaper resources like telecom and other commodities. Secondly, Nepal elected a Communist govt. and they will support china no matter what.
355 2018-09-11 03:59:20 Useless post. Indian are now more concerned about price rise of essential commodities and petroleum products.
356 2018-09-11 03:57:59 Labor is not a commodity. People are not to be treated like inanimate commodities, capital or another mere factor of production. Ppl are much more than an input and must be treated with dignity. Maybe you'll never understand that, but I hope you don't pass it onto ur kids
357 2018-09-11 03:56:28 That's the thing. We are NOT experiencing inflationary conditions. Not yet anyways despite the crazy hike in fuel prices. Check essential commodities, major vegetables , grains etc - prices are probably at their lowest since 15 years.
358 2018-09-11 03:48:34 Ppl hv problem with #PetrolPriceHike but ignoring othr commodities price fall.When UPA ws in power Petrol & commodities wr high in price plus corruption money giving growth to one particulr family.

359 2018-09-11 03:47:43 I actually heard about this at least 2 days before it even went out in the newspapers. The news was passed on to my Mom by an ex-military friend who named it 0ctober Revolution.  We were even advised to buy basic commodities like crazy before the supposed 0ct rev happens. 1/2
360 2018-09-11 03:45:08 Indians DIE in the #BharatBandh called by #RahulGandhi to protest against high fuel prices even when fuel is a part of the commodities basket used for calculating inflation, which is at an all time low. Jai Ho!

@dpradhanbjp @MrsGandhi @sambitswaraj @TajinderBagga @NalinSKohli
361 2018-09-11 03:41:20 The prices of basic commodities are soaring at record levels without any significant international crisis on which it can reasonably be blamed. Unemployment and underemployment are also on the rise.
362 2018-09-11 03:35:01 What's Intolerance?
Intolerance is when public is suffering silently the #hike in essential commodities.
Intolerance is when public supports #BharatBandh involuntarily.
Intolerance are the acts performed in fear and greed of power. @BJP4India @INCIndia @ShashiTharoor @PMOIndia.

364 2018-09-11 03:17:45 Generating funds for any noble cause require input from each and every individual of a society whether he is young, adult or an old. Young can sell commodities (cookies, juice) in schools with the fund raising titles, adults from their income and old by encouragement.

368 2018-09-11 03:06:43 Organic is a huge scam I tell you! 80% is just label, maybe 20% actual organic could be even lower. Having dealt with organic agri commodities I have had first hand experience.

370 2018-09-11 02:53:47 La fortaleza del dólar y los retos de economías emergentes:
1. Mayor servicio a la deuda, en moneda local
2. Precios más bajos de 'commodities'
3. Impacto ambiguo en crecimiento económico

371 2018-09-11 02:53:01 Boa discussão, de bom nível. Parabéns. Se me permitem participar, tenho fortes dúvidas sobre como a abertura de mercado vai permitir se agregar o valor em commodities.
372 2018-09-11 02:50:59 Like all neoliberals, conviction and principle are merely commodities to trade for self-gratification and self-advancement
373 2018-09-11 02:47:24 however in the end veganism is an animal rights movement and they’re just commenting on the fact once again animals are being use as commodities and posting their dead bodies around like it’s something to be proud of

375 2018-09-11 02:42:11 Drugs do not relax you, they turn you into a consumptive addict who relies on commodities to remain socially functional.
376 2018-09-11 02:33:56 I think about that all the time in disasters. They need to set them free so they may at least have a possible chance. Unfortunately, they’re only seen as commodities, not living beings just like “pets.” 
377 2018-09-11 02:28:53 Exactly what I've been saying all along. We're human commodities and acceptable losses.
378 2018-09-11 02:26:38 Every wise, just, and mild government, by rendering the condition of its subjects easy and secure, will always abound most in people, as well as in commodities and riches.
379 2018-09-11 02:25:22 "The crippling Israeli blockade has deprived its (Gaza Strip) two million inhabitants of many basic commodities."

Shameful and criminal.
380 2018-09-11 02:22:49 Mmmm just allow  us to afford the commodities, with the price  which  is there, by adding our sarary
381 2018-09-11 02:09:04 Despite soaring oil prices essential commodities are stable.Why dont people cut petrol consumption by 10./.  with every increase.That will be a good example.Politicians can walk to office.Public transport can be encouraged.Offices can work 4 days.All shops can be shut by 8pm.
382 2018-09-11 02:09:03 And who have the right to increase prices of commodities like mad max 
Govt is for the people nt for looting the people 
383 2018-09-11 02:08:24 They say media is just romanticizing things, pero parang hindi naman, kasi pumunta ka sa palengke, mahal na lahat ng commodities. Dumadaing na yung mga driver, mahal ang gas. Nagrereklamo na rin yung ilang commuter, mahal na raw ang pamasahe. Tapos hindi issue?! Ano gaguhan tayo?
384 2018-09-11 02:07:40 Reading the comments is very enlightening. So many resonate. It's almost as if fans in other sports are tired of being treated like disposable commodities. @thesoccerdon #SaveTheCrew
385 2018-09-11 02:06:43 Bahut se log petrol diesel price hike ka rona ro rahe h ki mar gaye khap gaye. Lekin Ek baat wo log kabhi nhi maante ki despite high fuel price, commodities are cheaper which used to touch sky during UPA times. So why cry foul. Carpool kar lo. CNG use kar lo.
386 2018-09-11 02:06:30 ## Hardly matters. Because price of all other essential commodities required for Poor as well as poor people of India have not shot up, especially Cereals,Pulses, Vegetables, Milk,Salt, edible oils,Sugar and many other commodities required everyday by people of India.
387 2018-09-11 02:01:43 in the Cars Cinematic Universe there‘s airport security reminiscent of our current system, which only came into being after the 9/11 attack, which means there’s a Cars Bin Laden, & a Cars WTC. But what commodities do they trade with their limited options as cars? In this essay I

392 2018-09-11 01:48:01 E as ferrovias, essenciais para o transporte das nossas commodities agrícolas ?
393 2018-09-11 01:45:21 hehehe the only Paraiso I know of is a memorial place in Rizal...LOL!
do they want us Filipinos to go straight to paraiso because we can't afford to eat... live owing to the skyrocketing prices of commodities!!!!
394 2018-09-11 01:43:11 Euphoria reaching peak in many markets. Tech, Financials, Marijuana, etc. My view continues to be that we are shifting from deflation to inflation & very few are positioned properly for this wealth transfer. Commodities don't get the respect they deserve, but soon to change.
395 2018-09-11 01:37:02 It's okay to lose those goals as they are rebuilding. No point in being mediocre.  Trade your commodities starting with Price and bottom out.
396 2018-09-11 01:23:21 Thoughts on Inflation: stop buying unnecessary stuff and alocate that amount of money to your basic commodities.

400 2018-09-11 01:11:24 People and kindness is the new currency. Get with the times . Transactions and businesses are becoming commodities and far too common. Want to stand out? CARE.
401 2018-09-11 01:10:47 I, too, weigh the benefits of the  commodities one might produce if I chose to make a *deeper investment* in a woman.
402 2018-09-11 01:08:01 That’s because those are established commodities. The bulls didn’t have an underlying desire to grow the technology behind gold to accommodate a new global asset for the masses.
403 2018-09-11 01:00:47 Como es posible q durante años los últimos gobiernos destruyeron la enseñanza básica, generaron miles de planeros. No aprovecharon los años de los grandes precios de los commodities y nos arrojaron a los brazos nuevamente del FMI
404 2018-09-11 00:56:40 @dailynation If rats are in your house and there are maize too, don't expect them not to eat.POLITICIANS ARE LIKE RATS.They protect themselves and forget us,thats the poor.THAT IS WHY THE PRICE OF IMPORTANT COMMODITIES CAN NOT GO DOWN BUT UP.They need prayers.
405 2018-09-11 00:55:48 I am originally from India and my country has a rape problem. Women are still sold as commodities in states like Haryana. Highest number of women in forced prostitution. Every country has its own problems. Look at it objectively. Bye
406 2018-09-11 00:48:03 Please excuse my ignorance but why is it not possible to find out the price of coal, when all other commodities are easily accessible?
407 2018-09-11 00:41:46 Tanto é que foram os fatores conjunturais de boom das commodities no governo Lula que aumentou a arrecadação a ponto de haver crescimento social que tivemos. É esse o ponto que eu quero chegar, nem gregos e nem troianos.
408 2018-09-11 00:40:36 Exatamente por isso a necessidade de diversificação da produção. Eu sei bem que a agricultura familiar é vital à segurança alimentar desse país, mas o que não dá pra negar é o giro econômico promovido pelas commodities, mas isso não justifica a nossa independência absurda delas.

410 2018-09-11 00:34:47 Why are government officials so deaf to hear the people’s cry of the rising prices of basic commodities? Getting so irritated with DTI Sec. Lopez who is on @iamkarendavila ‘s Headstart. How many times does she have to say naghihirap Na ang mga Tao for him to get it?
411 2018-09-11 00:29:27 I see your point, but factors like parental involvement / support, student attitudes and readiness do play a part in school success.  There are way for variables in the human business of education than in any commodities market.  Some similarities but not quite the same.
412 2018-09-11 00:27:33 That’s great but what are your current thoughts on interest rates, inflation, $GOLD and commodities???? 
413 2018-09-11 00:23:41 Commodity is near a bottom. 

Watching $USD and $YUAN would be important, both will determine the price of the commodities going forward.
414 2018-09-11 00:14:57 @moira Setting aside the mechanics of the Stafford Act and what assistance states ask for ahead of time, which varies a lot, one of the toughest things about a wide area storm like this is knowing just where to stage commodities. Don't want them swamped/cut off by the same storm

416 2018-09-11 00:05:26 Once a decade, I check in on the NFL. Let's see here...

Lions: Still terrible.

Cowboys: Still terrible.

Players: Still mostly treated as commodities/pawns/meat in an orgy of capitalism and bottom-of-the-barrel, jingoistic nationalism.

Bills: STILL TERRIBLE.
