1 2018-11-20 23:59:34 I suppose the right time to sell would've been when @bp22 sold all his crypto holdings, usually billionaires are right on, never too late)
2 2018-11-20 23:59:33 Someone cue that Blink 182 song.
3 2018-11-20 23:59:29 @mappopk_crypto hey
4 2018-11-20 23:59:23 Fake news
5 2018-11-20 23:59:18 Not sure what's good anymore....
6 2018-11-20 23:59:16 @xrp that’s why u only invest/play with what u can afford to lose.  If u have put other money in the game u get whaT u deserve.  It’s crypto in end whomthe hell knows what will,happen but if u just invest some side cash  shouldn’t be  it out. Think $xrp will pay off @hodl

8 2018-11-20 23:59:06 inventing a new crypto currency called "clown coin". the values are as shown:

1 honk = .10 clown coin
5 honks = .75 clown coin
pie in the face = 2 clown coin
getting your dick stuck in the sink = 10 clown coin
calling the boss "a sexy son of a gun" = bankrupt

10 2018-11-20 23:59:04 Really!!
11 2018-11-20 23:58:53 EXACTLY
12 2018-11-20 23:58:49 I agree with Sams disagreement! We love him just the way he is! Let the man do what he wants. No is telling you what to do and we love your stuff too!
13 2018-11-20 23:58:44 That's a smart idea, I'll start divvying up my crypto among various exchanges, I didn't even think of that! Thank you for the advice and for the great trading tips!
14 2018-11-20 23:58:29 Nope!? 

Noooopppee?!

Gare... Don't make this bear market harder for me. Lol
15 2018-11-20 23:58:28 only if i had another 100k to throw into this crypto game ...
16 2018-11-20 23:58:26 Breaking it down to a macro level, the US has 50 states all with boarders - the dollar is the universal currency.  When I see the term "cross border" I think cross currency.  When you are not changing currency, regardless of geography, $XRP utilization is likely pointless.
