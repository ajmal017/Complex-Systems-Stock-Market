73 2018-06-21 23:49:22 I haven’t personally had issues specifically with them BUT I have noticed that I get that sensation for all products when I put on my scalp unless it’s something natural like a straight up oil. Even the Cantu ACV root relief drives my scalp crazy after a bit

95 2018-06-21 23:45:59 Also talk about overcomplicating a plan. As much as I find the memetic status of ball bearings to be frustrating, them + bag of oil is the pinnacle of that plan.

112 2018-06-21 23:41:44 This tells you everything you need to know.
113 2018-06-21 23:41:38 Factoring in how we got to this point, the  issue of having to raise production is bullish. The bears (many in the media) kept writing about opec+ cheating, swimming in pools of oil and “lower for longer”.  Rothman was one analyst who called this lift.

While we were distracted with other stuff, I noticed Trump is going to clutter our shorelines with oil rigs, what is that man doing while we slow burn over poor clothing choices?

147 2018-06-21 23:37:46 you can go cheap on the oil/balm/etc., but don't cheap out on the brush. a bad brush will tear it all up and give you split ends. also beard shampoo is a scam. you can use head and shoulders on your face.

150 2018-06-21 23:37:09 I fuck oil
151 2018-06-21 23:37:07 Coconut oil is sent from the gods!!!! I used to have thick(er) thighs and coconut oil is fucking  it helps with stretch marks and scars too!!
152 2018-06-21 23:36:56 Why are we in Afghanistan? For the same reason we are in Iraq. They have OIL (and narcotics). The US powers that be are not interested in freedom for the Afghanis, just their oil and opium. Nothing new under the sun, GOP of Dems, W or BO, H or BC.

Sort of sling that took the pressure off his hip (I think), helped tremendously.  I’m going to tell her about this oil - she’s down south or I’d buy it for her myself.

166 2018-06-21 23:34:35 Take the Iraq war for example, The U.S had to spend billions of dollars and sacrifice their own men to bring down that sovereign nation. Who was the main beneficiary of that war? Not the U.S but China along side Israel. China is draining Iraq completely of its oil.

Cheap, unethical and unscrupulous company.
206 2018-06-21 23:27:57 Raging River Resources $RRX has set a new 52-week low today.  Much in part to the acquisition from #Baytex, another hated share dilution.  Oil up 50% over the past 12-months.  Unimaginable to think some  setting new 52w lows and even more lingering near all-time lows.

210 2018-06-21 23:27:26 Looks pretty good, snappy video. One thing though, your power source. DIESEL! So you will pick up the oil while spewing hydrocarbon particulates and all the and other lovelies into the ocean air. So you are fixing one problem and contributing to another. ;(
211 2018-06-21 23:27:14 that's good though. I grew mine out pretty big a few years ago. I'd suggest getting some beard oil and a beard brush to keep it under control and save you from tangles as it grows out

219 2018-06-21 23:24:55 If there was a shortage/limit of gas & demand was high, the higher prices are justified. The supply however is larger than the demand. Nigeria & several other non Middle East nations produce quality oil that is available. Big Corps are just greedy.

267 2018-06-21 23:18:10 Cheaper to do it myself!   Even if it means getting oil all over me which is super hard for me to stomach.  
268 2018-06-21 23:18:06 Regulations are what keeps our oil from the global market, we have very little tidewater access because of regulations. If we had global access our dollar would go up and that's not good for eastern industry.

274 2018-06-21 23:17:17 Here's a suggestion. Move all of the oil and gas fields from AB to QC, then have QCers dig it up and sell it for profit, thereby raising their wages. In such a case, ABans' wages would be much lower, on average, than QCers, and the equalization money would then be sent to AB.

281 2018-06-21 23:15:28 They actually are more humane than regular trapping, because when you use vegetable oil on them the glue loosens and you can let the rodent go. So what do you think is more humane? Live trapping where you starve the animal and may not realize

287 2018-06-21 23:14:35 No federal leasing on the Atlantic coast of the US since the early 80s. Obama announced his intention to open the Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic planning areas to oil and gas exploration. However, canceled in May 2010 following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf/Mexico.

290 2018-06-21 23:14:06 People are posting about how large groups of people are wrong, and how they belong to the group which is good.

My belief is that people who use olive oil instead of butter to male grilled cheese are monsters, especially when they say it's better. It is not! Use butter, not oil!
291 2018-06-21 23:13:57 I'm sure people think you are either anti renewable or work for big oil. It's the weirdest thing when EV superfans freak out when scams are reported on. If you want EVs to dominate then you should want The R&D budgets I dunno, applied toward the projects they're intended for?
292 2018-06-21 23:13:56 Nuclear is not much radiations. As nature. NG is huge about CO2 emissions. So only to replace coal or oil if nuclear is absolutely not available.

294 2018-06-21 23:13:46 You are seriously throwing me back. This is hilarious.
295 2018-06-21 23:13:41 The US can't even get a handle on it's own government or people... yet we are supposed to believe we have complete control of every other country around the world.  Are "the capitalists" the only people in the world with toilet paper and cooking oil Abby?

298 2018-06-21 23:13:19 @narendramodi Sir want to bring to your focus that Govt move to scrap subsidy for EV is quite a bad move. It feels oil and gas sector is muscling again to suppress adoption of cleaner fuel. It should be reconsidered.

305 2018-06-21 23:12:03 We've been eating meat for thousands of years. I wouldn't call a mix of ultra-processed soy and veg oil good. For people who choose to be vegan, actual whole food like beans, nuts and veggies is so much better than this stuff.
306 2018-06-21 23:11:58 You could try something organic like jojoba oil
307 2018-06-21 23:11:54 According to Alec, neem oil and diatomaceous earth are certified organic, but neem oil may be toxic to bees as well as the beetles. So he suggested not using it in the morning to avoid the bees. Neem oil he says is better though since they can fly, and it will still affect them

321 2018-06-21 23:10:18 Money flowed the other way before free trade and oil, once oil is gone the flow will reverse again. Hopefully free trade will be done with by then or Canada will really be in trouble. As Ontario and Quebec needs those manufacturing jobs back.

327 2018-06-21 23:09:44 I'm a pretty boy at heart.  Not in the face/build...but at heart.

And then I added an extra cup of flour cuz I can't count.

406 2018-06-21 22:59:19 I think more accurately, Ford will have the Ontario take in less revenue from gas tax, but within 30 days, the price will creep up and the oil companies will pocket more money.

We'll be pay the same but getting fewer services for it.

425 2018-06-21 22:56:55 Actually the only thing that works is prescribing to opioid users so they become stable, get a life, come off. Everything else is unproven money hustling, snake oil selling by profiteers and zealots. Opioids different to gambling, coke, alcohol.

427 2018-06-21 22:56:52 That's on everyone's "lol" playlist, right??
428 2018-06-21 22:56:38 Me I just want to be oil minister..
429 2018-06-21 22:56:26 Girl, an alignment should not be more than 60 bucks  oil costs like 30 or 20 if you get the good sales
430 2018-06-21 22:56:16 No heat/hot water/phone.
The water was heated by oil which we couldn't afford. The 70's
431 2018-06-21 22:56:09 But let's shrink public lands and sell rights to drill for oil. Ya you care so much about the environment. The Great Lakes are doomed.
432 2018-06-21 22:55:59 Sorry, I was referring to the comment about oil and environmental devastation. That’s Nigeria. I don’t doubt the US is up to something in Niger.
433 2018-06-21 22:55:57 Et deixes la més gran, Midnight Oil
434 2018-06-21 22:55:36 Lmaoooo fuhhhh. Welp, jus pop that hood, get the right kind of oil, maybe like a quart of it, then funnel it on down lmao. Do you know how to check if you’re low manually? Or is your car telling you it’s low?
435 2018-06-21 22:55:33 You people think your dealing with idiots, you knew exactly that this policy was about, now where apologizing and blaming others. Vote these snake oil salesman out
436 2018-06-21 22:54:59 When does the price discount on shale oil justify the investment to be able to process it? Would think more nimble refiners can see it coming and get first mover even peak demand narrative no?
437 2018-06-21 22:54:43 Vinegar & oil dressing, extra oil would be my guess
438 2018-06-21 22:54:34 whoever said baby oil help take off lashes a damn lie
439 2018-06-21 22:54:15 2 Yes, we played exhibition games back then.  The other 2 options for opponents were Athletes in Action or Marathon Oil. At this point I’ve been a member of the team all of about 3 weeks so I’m still trying to understand how not to get yelled at.
440 2018-06-21 22:54:13 I only added when i was going on a trip & i wasn’t due for a change but it seemed low. If you have a newer car & haven’t changed in about 5k miles/5 months you’re due. Older go by 3k/3 months. Not changing the oil when you should will mess up your engine in the long run.
441 2018-06-21 22:54:13 Hot/cold alternating compresses, cbd oil, memory foam mattress covers, white noise for distraction when trying to sleep, stretching throughout the day have all helped me/people I know!
442 2018-06-21 22:54:05 Medical cannabis is a must Sativex helps those with MS and Parkinson. We must get cannabis oil licensed quickly for the many children who suffer life threatening epilepsy.

445 2018-06-21 22:53:38 On the spiritual side I rubbed more restorative and protective essential oil blend into the vulnerable areas of my body, then rubbed salt in my solar plexus and then rue to neutralise active attacks. I also had the psalms on out loud (great for attacks) and was grounding.
446 2018-06-21 22:53:32 I'm in bed under a fan, lights off, oil diffuser surrounding my scents with peppermint and lavender, and I got Daniel Caesar playing..... I am so relaxed
447 2018-06-21 22:53:25 Spilled the whole bottle of essential oil in my room & now it’s too strong & giving me a headache 
448 2018-06-21 22:53:16 lol just wait til venezuela is open again to foreign oil companies

449 2018-06-21 22:53:01 I saw the schedule for the Oil.  Could be disastrous as Talbot tends to start slowly and because of the teams we play.  Still, I believe Cam bounces back quick and Connor is going to keep his promise.  Can’t wait!
450 2018-06-21 22:52:57 Imagine if they ate like people of S Italy in 79AD! Lots of fatty meat and lots fat added to food and lots garum, ligurian oil , fish etc etc... and no dental disease in that time too, even though some bakeries!  Imagine ...

457 2018-06-21 22:52:21 For the physical side of things I took paracetamol, extra steroid dose to help with the stress, rehydration sachets for my salt imbalance, cbd oil for nausea and psychosis -

460 2018-06-21 22:52:08 It's all cannabis!  Oil or dry herb...  It is both medicine and recreation.  If one is good then the other is too.  Choice of how to 'injest' are by the by.

471 2018-06-21 22:51:11 I've heard castor oil on the scalp works well. When my hair got thin, I used a lot of dry shampoo to fluff it up.
472 2018-06-21 22:50:56 I remembered I have some cannabis kombucha and THC cooking oil, so it's turning into an edible afternoon.
473 2018-06-21 22:50:42 Were the Blackshirts and the tin of castor oil the giveaway?
474 2018-06-21 22:50:40 Women really do be on here bragging about doing basic ass shit, too much shit and/or taking the bare minimum from niggaz..  Be like "I cook, clean, do laundry, pay the bills, change his oil, rotate tires, never complain about anything, chew his food before he swallow it etc

491 2018-06-21 22:48:37 What do you think of Oil Cleansing and how do you do it? If you use another cleanser after oil cleansing off your makeup is it still as effective??
492 2018-06-21 22:48:27 Shouldn't have left. For what? Oil? Wealth for billionaires? To murder iraqi civilians?

500 2018-06-21 22:47:28 Doesn't a lot of their $$ come from oil?  They wouldn't want mass transit which would use less than everyone driving themselves, using less energy & creating less pollution.  They are on bed with Pruitt.

502 2018-06-21 22:46:57 Here is my call. 600k bpd increase total. Oil price should be $3 higher but the bears will go “oh no”.....   Market is tight and Andurand is not wrong on $100.
503 2018-06-21 22:46:42 Any tax decrease has been swallowed whole by the increase in heating oil, gas and the increase in prices from Tariffs.

518 2018-06-21 22:44:13 Might not be exact because the restaurant probably adds some stuff to it, but yes it’s the same thing. I always add sesame oil and chili paste to it at home! It’s a really good sauce to use as a base, but it’s also good on its own.
519 2018-06-21 22:44:11 Olive Oil could have asked it all, making out in Topeka.
520 2018-06-21 22:43:54 Em ?

In 1970s Britain avoided going to the IMF for a hand out (going bankrupt basically)

Discovery of Scottish oil saved Thatcher from having to do that
521 2018-06-21 22:43:32 My point is that it is only a replacement, not an improvement.  Of course, if you don't care about CO2 generation, you can do it.  But the point of expending the energy, fertilizer, nutrients (many made from oil) to get to the same place escapes me.

525 2018-06-21 22:43:18 I've read into this and was told the best home remedy is to apply smth like castor oil and then put a towel over it then put a heating pad over the towel. I haven't tried it yet because i dont have any castor oil so i can't really speak to how well it works ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

558 2018-06-21 22:37:53 Yes I definitely wouldn’t recommend it by itself. Mixed with other ingredients it’s great! One of my favorite hyaluronic acid serums has tea tree oil in it and I LOVE it. Really helps when I’m breaking out. It’s the @DelishCondish HA + Squalane.

I just wouldn’t put oils directly on them. I believe there’s a link on Doterra’s page that has more info for pets.

572 2018-06-21 22:35:53 @sajidjavid @theresa_may 115,000 of us are calling on you to legalise medicinal cannabis oil, promising a review is not enough. Public support is behind us, change this law and save lives! #MedicalCannabisNow
573 2018-06-21 22:35:42 Why would you want to decrease the cash flow of big pharma? They are the medical equivalent of big oil on renewable energy sources or the big bank equivalent on debt or the military industrial complex on war!
574 2018-06-21 22:35:40 今日いれたコーヒーはなぜかごま油の香りがする。
Why my today's coffee has a sesami oil flavor??
575 2018-06-21 22:35:30 I'm so glad I grew up the way I did being in the oil change business learning so much from my godfather. Those skills will never go away rusty yes but it's like riding a bike. An it makes me able to do things that can save me money from paying someone else
576 2018-06-21 22:35:30 Bop till u drop 
577 2018-06-21 22:35:24 Applying economic pressure (instead of sending bribes of food and oil like in the past) will work, I think.
578 2018-06-21 22:35:15 Don't forget about all the birds that are killed by wind. The turbines really mess with eco systems.
579 2018-06-21 22:34:53 The oil should be for medical purposes definitely.
580 2018-06-21 22:34:51 That's how it works good luck brico
581 2018-06-21 22:34:47 Oil and U308 are not the same commodities .Compare apples to apples not grapes. MC for U308 is minute
582 2018-06-21 22:34:42 Main reason she lost. Too many were imagining it
583 2018-06-21 22:34:27 Smoked in oil based in 70/80’s mellow and relaxed.
Took a few blows for memory sake 3 years ago, paranoid psycho event. Just no.
584 2018-06-21 22:34:13 The UK is crrently slowest growing economy in the western world.  And yes, it is behind the southern europeans. UK was in economic stagnation before if begged to join the EC in 1971 and that is where it's heading now: only Scottish oil saved it.  And you won't have that for long.
585 2018-06-21 22:34:02 I used it and didn't work. Right now am using Avon skin so soft  tissue oil and it works. My stretch marks faded.
586 2018-06-21 22:34:01 Don't think it effects everybody the same way.I think a drug that causes schizophrenia is dangerous to society .The cannabis oil should be given the ok if its helped the boy
587 2018-06-21 22:33:57 @bbcquestiontime btw, the medicine that boy received was Cannabis oil and apparently it does not have have THC.
588 2018-06-21 22:33:50 These random national days annoy me, but I’ll make an exception.
589 2018-06-21 22:33:50 They're not paying attention as they're to frothed up over Melanie's jacket and the fact PDJT had a bigger container of Ranch salad dressing at lunch than the oil and vinegar options.

590 2018-06-21 22:33:50 Tuna in sunflower oil is one of the worst things i’ve ever come across in life
591 2018-06-21 22:33:48 Putting out fires the only way he knows how - slathered in oil and welding a flamethrower.
592 2018-06-21 22:33:46 1970  launch a war on drugs
2001 launch a war on terror
They claim its a war 4 oil
But in reality its a war 2 keep the poppy fields safe & producing 2 keep heroin coming in & the DEA busy It also kept Big Pharm happy & making their pain pills its not oil that is wanted its drugs
593 2018-06-21 22:33:39 Our new strategy will be to continue to force the Fed govt to spend more $$$ on huge infrastructure projects like securing pipelines.  What should we ask for next? Refinery, Nuclear power plant? Oil Catapult ?

If only there was a way to help, it rhymes w/ locial sicense

If cannabis oil can help with epilepsy then why don't people understand it will harm the non epileptic brain?
595 2018-06-21 22:33:26 Because the regulator offshore boards have a mandate to expand oil and gas. Zero concern for whales. #unacceptable @gorman_mary
596 2018-06-21 22:33:26 If you put the average college student on a construction site or an oil rig they'd be just as lost as a trade worker in a biology class. Can't help but think their definition of "educated" is biased
597 2018-06-21 22:33:10 rub oil on them. they will come out u know
598 2018-06-21 22:33:08 A teaspoon of castor oil you'll start your contractions and go into labor
599 2018-06-21 22:32:56 Kim Kardashian is exactly like Trump. Capitalists to the extreme that care about nothing but fame and (their own) fortune. Both reality stars that, despite wealth, continue to shill scam products to a gullible public like modern day snake oil salesmen.
600 2018-06-21 22:32:49 Wil the oil take me to heaven or clean my sins

A million?
 2 million?
$0 ?
603 2018-06-21 22:31:53 There was a good article in FW about oil finishes.  The guy sands to 2000 before oiling.  I think you need to do that w/ oil to get a nice sheen.
604 2018-06-21 22:31:52 this oil has my face itching 
605 2018-06-21 22:31:48 I’ve just used a sample of the Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Cleansing Oil and i am in love
606 2018-06-21 22:31:41 That's going to be hard to avoid... Interning for an oil company I mean
607 2018-06-21 22:31:14 This demand is coming primarily emerging markets in Asia. It will take a psychotic break in the markets and world economy like 2008 to derail $100 plus oil.
608 2018-06-21 22:31:12 You add oil to it all the time is well.  So you say it nets out?
609 2018-06-21 22:30:45 momo with a fan. oil on canvas (2018)
610 2018-06-21 22:30:44 It’s ludicrous to charge so much for such an easy-to-grow plant. Why is it that CBD oil and creams cost so much?! It doesn’t even get you high yet it has the same stigma as a drug therefore more expensive. Scam scam scam.
611 2018-06-21 22:30:36 What kind of snake (oil)/water will someone be trying to sell someone next, duh !!!!!?????
612 2018-06-21 22:30:35 Lol vitamin C serum + gel,hyaluronic acid,  tea tree oil, vitamin E lol and a ton of sunscreen!
613 2018-06-21 22:30:34 @realDonaldTrump 
Tribal warfare in Libya has cut about 500,000 barrels per day of oil production.  
But they do not care so long as my leader becomes the true leader of all of Libya.
614 2018-06-21 22:30:32 Probably.  But we have heard that for decades.  As global oil usage has increased tremendously, we still have known in ground reserves larger than we have ever had.  Trillions of barrels and hundreds of years supply.
615 2018-06-21 22:30:29 No it wouldn't Mexico has the 9th largest economy in the world it's main sources of income are tobacco, chemicals, iron and steel, oil, clothing, do your research before you talk about a country you know nothing about
616 2018-06-21 22:30:21 Definitely acceptable as a hotel fridge beer - it’s cold, tastes ok and better than the other one in there. I’d prefer a Neck Oil though
617 2018-06-21 22:30:15 Cause that is where I get all my frames unless its a Cell Disney print or high price oil painting. I have lots of paintings but I have got tons of the OVerwatch World of Warcraft Diablo posters I frame and the frames that are large are a good price at Michaels
618 2018-06-21 22:30:08 ohhh, the luxury of being a Provincial politician.  Only one group to serve (AB Base), no need to unite and see everyone's point of view (The Country).  The oil is in Canada too.
619 2018-06-21 22:30:07 All I Did Was Put Oil In My Car And These Damn Mosquitoes Got Me Rubbing Alcohol All Over My Body
620 2018-06-21 22:30:02 Lowkey that foundation is so bad. It hugged every nook and cranny on my skin, separated like nobodies business and made my skin hella dry despite it breaking up from the oil I don’t typically have. Plus it broke after one use and the coverage was like... not there lol
621 2018-06-21 22:30:02 no offense but oil blotting sheets are my only best friend
622 2018-06-21 22:29:58 with all of the #oil #naturalgas #water #diamonds #gold #stone #lumber #electricity #fish and countless other resources in #Canada, we should be the richest citizens in the world with zero poverty... something is broken.

624 2018-06-21 22:29:47 Does he think we did not see what happened when he was president, most notably in 2014? The man has to be the most self unaware person in the world. @BarackObama
625 2018-06-21 22:29:45 Exactly, but Trump supporters and numbers, like water and oil.
Contacted my MoCs to complain that on reading the EO signed 6/20 there're too many loopholes that will allow continued family separations and also to demand Congress come up w/a plan to reunite those separated.
626 2018-06-21 22:29:38 I really want to try CBD oil for my stomach and digestive issues where can I get some 
627 2018-06-21 22:29:28 i love my grandmas food but i always leaves her house smelling like oil and spices
628 2018-06-21 22:29:21 Plus can they at least distinguish non addictive cannabis oil from cannabis which turns people into zombies!
629 2018-06-21 22:29:10 がんばwww
630 2018-06-21 22:29:08 Mexico has trillions of dollars in oil gas copper and the government owns most of it. Americans are not allowed to own property in Mexico only citizens can do that. When are you going to MAKE them shut down the drug trade???   Do something!!!
631 2018-06-21 22:29:01 I put too much coconut oil on this morning. I’ve been slipping and sliding all day in my heels

635 2018-06-21 22:28:34 I could live quite comfortably off of freshly baked bread dipped in olive oil.
636 2018-06-21 22:28:06 I do prefer articles not written by Big Oil front groups, thank you. The TBT news article states that he listened but never endorsed in 2010.
 
Nelson is adamantly against and filed legislation to block DOI plans to drill Florida. Rick Scott supports drilling Florida. Period.
637 2018-06-21 22:28:02 He is a hack.  Turned his back on auto industry sure will do the same to oil and gas.  Don't waste your vote!!!

645 2018-06-21 22:27:00 On both sides politicians failed their parties over and over in favor of enriching their oil wn lives, then put the masses together to keep blame off themselves. Fuck them all and fuck those that purchased them bit by bit.

655 2018-06-21 22:25:37 This is big. The Koch Brothers in the United States are trying to kill public transit initiatives, most recently in Nashville; cars and oil are better for their bottom line. It is a calamity happening in real time.

657 2018-06-21 22:25:34 kinda basic random thought but... “oil of every pearl’s” reminds me of “shaking the habitual”???

703 2018-06-21 22:19:34 Do it man! It’s a damn good skill to have and know. Once you learn it well, stay in the oil and gas field. That’s where you’ll make the most money it just takes time, patience and experience. I’m still trying.

724 2018-06-21 22:16:34 Tesla is working to end our dependence on imported oil, among other things. You and your reprehensible ilk, on the other hand, are desperately trying to damage or destroy this incredibly innovative American engine of economic development in order to line your pocket. Go to hell.
725 2018-06-21 22:16:18 It's actually possible, you do it by setting fire on oil that is on top of the water

1) Establish dominance ("WTF is he gonna do next? OMG!")
2) Set the open high, publicize it.
3) Meet & measure.

748 2018-06-21 22:13:58 Not one thing Trump has done has helped working Americans. Oil companies have done well, polluting our land and water. But he is destroying our formerly healthy solar industry. Trump is a greedy, soulless kidnapper of children.
749 2018-06-21 22:13:56 Yes. They need those oil profits. We are post-peak right now. You know it because big oil is already airing commercials about alternative fuel sources. Planting some seeds.

774 2018-06-21 22:10:55 I was thinking about the oil & seeing how it helps many children. What society are we if we ignore the pain of a child in order to keep money in big pharma’s pockets? An oil that helps vs narcotics to destroy kids’ livers & we know opiates, spasm meds, seizure meds do mind alter.
775 2018-06-21 22:10:47 Sounds like snake oil to me.

793 2018-06-21 22:09:10 At least ninety-five percent of the southern oil production and export revenue.

807 2018-06-21 22:07:12 Well, BC should stop expanding NatGas for Alberta’s oil sand production and that will help. That was primarily what caused the increase. On the bright side, it’s growing at half the GDP and a third of population growth.
808 2018-06-21 22:07:10 you know when you go to shower, and the inconsiderate fuck before you lathered their whole body in baby oil, so you take a step, start slipping and your life flashes before your eyes
809 2018-06-21 22:07:00 Your insidious accusations, your gas lighting of @ofoc was sickening, so patronising. The Corbyn cult is snake oil.
810 2018-06-21 22:06:45 Believe it or not I have the capacity to care about the human rights of lots of people--soldiers being sent to die for oil profits AND innocent people being sent to concentration camps simply for seeking a better life.
811 2018-06-21 22:06:34 I think you can do it with vegetable oil, but you have to have eggs.  Do you eat dairy?  Butter would probably work, too.  The important thing is the fat and the eggs.

829 2018-06-21 22:04:28 I'm confused by what decision could actually be bearish for oil. In my mind one keeps it in the $60-80 range (mild production increases) and the other on sends it to an unsustainable $100+ and then a potential crash.
830 2018-06-21 22:04:17 Hard to pick! Multivitamin, vitamin D, Fish oil, CoQ10, Magnesium. So many more!
831 2018-06-21 22:04:15 Roasted vegetables. Take a veggie, cut it up, roast with olive oil, salt, pepper. So much deliciousness comes from this.
832 2018-06-21 22:04:03 Does Melania invest her income in Prisons, lending institutions, coal, oil & gas, copper mines, defense...? Don’t fall for sweet shy little lady act. Dad is a known communist & who recently became a US citizen. She puts in just enough appearances that seem to be timed distraction
833 2018-06-21 22:03:57 Coconut oil, it's one of the few oils that can fit into our hair shaft so your hair literally eats it and it will promote growth 
834 2018-06-21 22:03:57 I think I subconsciously named my sona Phyr because of all the heat-related injuries I've experienced.

835 2018-06-21 22:03:53 However 1/3 of the coast is in danger of being polluted by dirty tar sand oil.

842 2018-06-21 22:02:32 This isn't "news", it's an article written by an organization that is a front for the oil industry (and is supported Big Oil). They promote offshore drilling and fracking in Florida. 

They attack Nelson since he puts Florida FIRST and stands in their way.

846 2018-06-21 22:01:42 Well, that's for the best anyways. Red sauce is easy. Alfredo is a bit tougher. Key is always garlic. Garlic garlic garlic. You gotta garlic liberally and toss it in some olive oil on medium low for a minute to release the aroma.
847 2018-06-21 22:01:30 If you are truly serious about the environment please stop all oil sands production. If you are not willing to do that stop talking about how you care for the environment. You lose all credibility.

857 2018-06-21 22:01:02 Well let's say the price of oil goes to $40 and process automation (EMR's strength) spending stagnates. Would it still make sense for ROK (industrial automation play) to be part of EMR?
858 2018-06-21 22:00:52 I was mystified by the process with the oil in the cupcake tin.

+ I can produce my own electricity like I can filter used cooking oil for a diesel,
+ upfront costs are around £1500, not more,

869 2018-06-21 22:00:08 *DJ IRAQ OIL MIN: IRAQ'S PROPOSAL FOR GRADUAL INCREASE REJECTED BY OPEC MINISTERIAL COMMITTEE
870 2018-06-21 21:59:51 So hard 2have these umbrella labels of vegetarian &vegan as such a huge difference in between individuals. Some actually eat whole unprocessed plant foods and others live on hundreds of variations of bread/pasta based processed foods, fake meat. Real cheese vs proc oil based
871 2018-06-21 21:59:43 try some coconut oil if you have it
872 2018-06-21 21:59:39 *IRAQ OIL MIN.: 1M B/D INCREASE APPROVED BY MAJORITY, NOT ALL
873 2018-06-21 21:59:38 Win Nov canola up A$2.87/t & EU rape up A$5.47. Demand for canola strong with China interested in canola & oil. Ongoing slow farmer selling. Still a bit more weakness in US soybns with good growing conditions.
874 2018-06-21 21:59:35 $200 for an oil change and alignment??? @Honda you’re kidding me right
875 2018-06-21 21:59:30 Just don't judge me too harshly. I'm making the best of it here. *He heats up some oil in pan.* If you make some coffee, all will be forgiven.
876 2018-06-21 21:59:25 Does anybody know how to add oil to a car and wants to get smoked out? Lol

879 2018-06-21 21:59:19 My body looks like a French fry left in oil for too long
880 2018-06-21 21:58:34 I think you should be boiled.  Preferably in oil.
881 2018-06-21 21:58:33 No matter

Engines, oil, steel —

More than
The rust.
882 2018-06-21 21:58:26 That’s some great stuff. Does he have the erv Palica from the 1961 Union Oil set last one I need for the rainiers
883 2018-06-21 21:58:19 BREAKING: #OPEC pre-meeting agrees despite Iran walk-out to recommend 1 million b/d *nominal* increase. 

Saudi #oil minister says real hike would be “something less because not every country can respond. What’s actually delivered ... is going to be a smaller number”

892 2018-06-21 21:57:27 I need help. Where can I find a good amount of peopermint oil? Like not the little bottle that essential oils come in I need some for my hair?
893 2018-06-21 21:57:17 EZ shares -1%, US shares -0.6% as trade war worries remain (not helped by Daimler profit outlook downgrade).
US 10 yr yld -4bp to 2.9%.

ASX futures -0.5%.
$A 0.7374 as $US index -0.3%.
894 2018-06-21 21:57:13 Why cause I was smart enough to carry my own charger in case my phone is low? Nope. “They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them”
895 2018-06-21 21:56:49 might fuck around and actually try to learn oil painting, instead of just thinking “damn it’d be cool if I could do oil paintings” and then crying when I can’t mix skin tones properly. who knows though
896 2018-06-21 21:56:36 I think you're right, it's all abt RU oil n energy pipelines. Iran built one they want destroyed so bet this is next, war w/Iran. Every day DT's in the WH is dangerous for millions of us around the world. Putin n DT want world dominance n probably included Xi in on the deal...
897 2018-06-21 21:56:32 Good call. It’s about to rupture like an oil well in West Texas
898 2018-06-21 21:56:30 Not really. They will be in charge at some point.

But Jacobins gotta be Jacobins and there will be somebody somewhere who will decide Kathy Griffin needs to be purged.
899 2018-06-21 21:56:18 The rained out 50 lapper for the Van Hoy Oil Indiana/Ohio Shootout Series has been rescheduled to Sunday, Aug. 19th. All classes on the original schedule will return. As is stands right now this will be the final race to determine the overall point champion for the series.
900 2018-06-21 21:56:12 So true. Im still gently working on my husband to give up seed oils and margarine. He sees nothing wring eith canola oil. At least hes not afraid of Sat fat anymore. He's smart but also a skeptic of everything who rides the middle line thinking moderation is key
901 2018-06-21 21:56:02 In a medium glass bowl, prepare marinade by mixing garlic, light olive oil, basil, salt, pepper, lemon juice and parsley. Place salmon fillets in a medium glass baking dish, and cover with the marinade. Marinate in the refrigerator about 1 hour, turning occasionally.

905 2018-06-21 21:55:28 Didn’t know because Otamendi plays for an oil money club, he is better than Peoe because of it. Also didn’t know Carvalho played for Porto either (he doesn’t) I learn something new everyday.
906 2018-06-21 21:55:26 Why so mean to shitpiles? At least they're useful - makes good fertilizer for instance. Cruz is an oil slick, befouling everything he touches. This one we can get rid of in Nov; let's replace 'ol slick with @BetoORourke .

910 2018-06-21 21:54:57 I had a strange dream that @cardsoldier and I went to @BullMoose to pick up a newly released GameCube Classic. The snake oil salesman of an employee at the register told me they had a limited edition bundle that included Melee in the back room...
911 2018-06-21 21:54:49 I make a great cucumber tomato salad with olive oil, cracked pepper, sea salt and an oregano.
912 2018-06-21 21:54:47 Lifetime supply of coconut oil and a date with the phanatic
913 2018-06-21 21:54:40 #pnpcbc It does seem unfair to include one resource, oil, and not another, hydro. Surely all revenue sources should be included.

918 2018-06-21 21:54:05 Add one hundred ounces of olive oil and put back on heat.
919 2018-06-21 21:54:02 Doesn’t Germany get a large portion of their oil supplies from RU? I’ve also noticed that Germans I know, spew Kremlin talking points like they’re gospel.
920 2018-06-21 21:53:57 Try changing your oil and after emptying the oil realizing you don't have the tool you need.. walked to O'Reilly's after that.

924 2018-06-21 21:53:23 Nothing like shipping to Canada + exchange rates to really put the brakes on impulse purchases. $44 for 9 amazing perfume oil samples? Totally doable. Add $15 shipping THEN 30% exchange and now I’m dropping $75 and I don’t even know if I’ll like them. Bah.

932 2018-06-21 21:52:21 For garlic greens I toss long stem broccoli and green beans in mustard oil and chopped garlic, good pinch of salt and pepper and fry in a griddle pan until charred. Lush.

939 2018-06-21 21:50:40 If you review your tweets you realize that most of them are about #Hafter.  You didn’t talk about Badi who was responsible for the distraction of the International airport, you didn’t talk about so called the militias who came to Alsidra and bumped the oil tanks in  2014.

947 2018-06-21 21:49:29 It's cute how all these southerners and midwesterners think they could survive a war when their internet, cell phones, electricity, fox news, oil companies and railroad offices are all in the Northeast.
They'd go a few days without phone, cable, internet and amazon then beg.
948 2018-06-21 21:49:26 WHAT THE FFFFF MY OIL CAP ON MY CAR IS GONE 
949 2018-06-21 21:49:22 Dare I even ask about the other? Does it look like it could be used to drill for oil? Hammer in rivets?

"..but fuck 'em"
951 2018-06-21 21:49:12 The damage done to communities was catastrophic. How do you quantify it? You could add up all the suicides, premature deaths, the misery, the heartache, the missed opportunities, the substance abuse & blame it on Thatcher attacking the block grant while oil revenues flowed south

956 2018-06-21 21:48:38 If you are one of the 70% of people  who still erroneously think twitter users who use 'Dr.' are doctors, you have been a victim of propaganda. No shame in being manipulated but don't continue playing the fool.  Educate yourself and don't buy snake oil.
957 2018-06-21 21:48:23 Great job trying to make him look crazy. Fact of the matter is big oil wants him dead and Tesla burnt to the ground.
958 2018-06-21 21:48:20 Tea tree oil works wonders
959 2018-06-21 21:48:19 A Muslim oil man finessed me today lol it's cool tho, they all smell good.. my favorite is called "all around philly" 
960 2018-06-21 21:48:11 Just like oil/gas prices; she only holds news conferences and gripes about prices during GOP admins... 
961 2018-06-21 21:47:55 It didn’t work for me. My hair would dry out. So I switched to some olive oil daily moisturizer
962 2018-06-21 21:47:33 Yeah, well, at least three of them are almost COMPLETELY funded by big oil and gas. I would expect nothing less.
963 2018-06-21 21:47:28 It’s so bad that I just vacuumed/washed my car, changed my oil and got home in the time it use to take me to get back to Milford from work.
964 2018-06-21 21:47:27 Yes!  I agree.  We are so quick to march in somewhere when our oil supply might be threatened.
965 2018-06-21 21:47:21 I'll be jumping in a band at Notting Hill carnival for the first time this year. I'm slightly nervous because there'll be paint and oil 
966 2018-06-21 21:47:17 Silver buy all the silver thats available and go long miners. Also keep stockpiling oil
967 2018-06-21 21:47:14 Duhoux (Companion to Linear B 1, p. 293) suggests that they “worked for the palace”, which must be true but has the air of a euphemism. Some of them (probably) are recorded receiving oil on another tablet (Fo 101), but that doesn’t prove anything one way or another.
968 2018-06-21 21:47:07 I am afraid comparing Norway with Scotland is completely unrealistic; due to Norways oil fund. 
969 2018-06-21 21:47:01 That oil of ulay’s really paying off now.
970 2018-06-21 21:47:00 If i'm to draft, my picks will be

3. Trae young
4. Porter jr
5. Mo Bamba
971 2018-06-21 21:46:55 Trump wants lower oil.  KSA historically listens to U.S.
972 2018-06-21 21:46:33 I almost wondered if it’s a migraine but I don’t have any other migraine systems. All I did was rub lavender oil on my stomach and that made me almost throw up. From the gentle physical pressure perhaps? Or an energy reason?
973 2018-06-21 21:46:25 The Oil Kings are a full-time concern in this town.
974 2018-06-21 21:46:14 When does yuan weakening/dollar strengthening become the subject of a Trump tweet?  He’s tweeted about oil prices and just about everything else.
975 2018-06-21 21:46:09 Someone at work was saying our butter alternative "contains nothing found in nature".
It's almost entirely vegetable oil and fat, salt, beta carotene (the pigment in carrots), citric acid (vitamin C). Only questionable ingredients are artificial flavors and polydimethylsiloxane.
976 2018-06-21 21:46:07 Fr his parents are oil tycoons if I'm not mistaken
977 2018-06-21 21:45:41 It looks like a jumbo bottle of that pine oil cleaner from the supply closest
978 2018-06-21 21:45:41 Yeah, because it's The Religion of Peace®. The "peace" of mass graves, after the last Unbeliever is murdered and buried.
979 2018-06-21 21:45:00 @jasoncundy05 has @andygoldstein05 been given a licence to use cannabis oil?
980 2018-06-21 21:44:55 February has 3 separate eastern trips for the Oil... ouch
981 2018-06-21 21:44:48 And all those guns, you sure kill lots of garlic and olive oil, and now there's just this lingering scent of cow poop in the car :(
982 2018-06-21 21:44:42 And the oil companies should NEVER be immunized from lawsuits, certainly not for a paltry $40/ton CO2 tax.
983 2018-06-21 21:44:22 Can I be there as your gay glam squad to make sure they get all your good angles, also to oil up that fat ol booty of yours? Kay thanks. 10% bby 10%

986 2018-06-21 21:44:16 I drove all the way from Richmond to Roanoke to find out when I got here that i have zero oil in my car smh. I feel like I just put some in there
987 2018-06-21 21:44:15 Man this oil change guy isn’t very smart.

989 2018-06-21 21:43:59 Oil and natural gas do a lot for New Mexico. But which one is your favorite? (p.s. We understand if you can’t pick just one)
990 2018-06-21 21:43:24 Amanda is a  general practitioner that likes Chili oil on their green peppers pizza with grape juice
991 2018-06-21 21:43:21 That’s how bruschetta is done in Italy too. Rub cut side of garlic on toasted bread, add salt & oil. It’s really good! I don’t know where garlic bread was invented but it wasn’t in Southern Europe.
992 2018-06-21 21:43:18 This is actually the best way to make real garlic bread!  You crush the clove and rub it against the toast and then sprinkle on salt and olive oil.
993 2018-06-21 21:43:14 I wish oil leaks repaired themselves. I don't wanna drop $800 on repairs :(
994 2018-06-21 21:42:23 You mean big win for big oil? Can’t you tell the truth about anything? Your trade deal with China is completely screwing farmers! We will remember in November!
995 2018-06-21 21:42:20 I can ask my fiance! He's the garden expert! Although from what little experience I have, neem oil seems to be a good deterrent for most bugs
996 2018-06-21 21:42:16 #AntarcticTexasTeaParty Putin's clout with GOP and Koch's is of course his master stroke of seizing Landlord status over earths greatest oil promise ..The Antarctic ..Arctic oil is as already his baby...want future oil...gotta please Mr P
997 2018-06-21 21:42:08 Getting hold of cannabis oil isn't has hard as you may think, if you know someone who can get cannabis then you will not be far from someone who makes oil, Supply is going up to meet demand. There are thousands of ppl in #UK putting their freedom at risk growing so ppl can get it

1000 2018-06-21 21:41:44 I also read that he's opening up the oceans and Great Lakes for unlimited oil drilling. And planning on merging the Education and Labor departments. Holy crap!
1001 2018-06-21 21:41:42 Lmaoo shorties aside go get you a bottle of CBD oil. I been on it for 3 days cause my anxiety was turning me agoraphobic and my minds finally been moving at a pace I'm comfortable with

1004 2018-06-21 21:41:16 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
1005 2018-06-21 21:41:15 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

1008 2018-06-21 21:40:57 It was also used by the Sun when a strike broke out at an oil refinery before Brown used it. Strike ended when local strikers unionised the migrant labour used to undermine the strike. Great story...Anyway, this is another strange instance were we agree
1009 2018-06-21 21:40:44 While it’s more complicated than calories in, calories out, it’s still very simple. Cut the refined carbs and sugar, eat real food like meat and leafy green vegetables, eat natural fats like olive oil and butter, avoid seed oils, lower stress, lift weights, and get good sleep.
1010 2018-06-21 21:40:33 I bought castor oil and if it doesn’t give me eyelashes like Jorja Smith, I am going to FLIP.

1015 2018-06-21 21:40:02 Lingering worries about global trade tensions, renewed political concerns in Italy and a fresh slide for oil prices put world stock markets under pressure and helped drive US and German government bond prices higher.  FT
1016 2018-06-21 21:39:55 I hate cooking. Tried making chilli; no seasoning, no onions and don’t like the look of the kidney beans so I’ll be having mince, tomatoes and rice, had a oil spill to rival BP and set my arm on fire. Ruined my dressing gown I’m fuming. Should’ve ordered dominos 
1017 2018-06-21 21:39:48 See when we were reached peak oil in the mid 80's when there was a great chance to invest in Scotland we unfortunately were run by our neighbours. The tories sold everything off, destroyed our industries and attacked the block grant at every opportunity, even suspending Barnett.
1018 2018-06-21 21:39:40 Okay we need 20 feet of rope, waterbed mattress, olive oil, hire a midget (with red hair) and adult diapers!
1019 2018-06-21 21:39:18 Drive oil prices into the ground and it'll have the same effect as a magnifying lens on a worm.
1020 2018-06-21 21:39:13 You’re no oil painting yourself, dear.

1023 2018-06-21 21:38:23 I used coconut oil.
1024 2018-06-21 21:38:12 So despite your right out lies, facts once again show you are nothing but a con man trying to find some snake oil to the foolish. Is your face red, knowing we now know our PM bought it himself? I doubt it, you lack moral values to feel shame.

Who wants run of the mill when you could have these amazing olive oil crisps.....delightful 

1031 2018-06-21 21:37:16 From the pro-UK perspective there were equivalent lies..the recent Growth commission report is a response ..over egging the oil price, over simplifying the risk of hard border, having no currency or central bank, dismissing the risks and issues around diverging tax regimes etc
1032 2018-06-21 21:36:55 Capsaicin is an oil, best diluted with alcohol.

1045 2018-06-21 21:34:21 Halliburton: Days before the event, Halliburton purchased Boots and Coots – the largest oil clean up firm in the world – for a quarter of a billion dollars. Subsequently, Halliburton’s gylf cleanup efforts increased their profits by 83% in just 3 months.

1056 2018-06-21 21:33:13 Take carrots, onions, and celery -and chop them all up real small.  Cook them in a pan with olive oil until they are soft. Add a jar of marinara sauce and put it in a blender. Boom!
1057 2018-06-21 21:33:12 Lo mismo dijo de pemex y que se crearían empleos y bajarían los precios del combustible y sólo se han enriquecido más sus allegados, si no me creen ahí está Sierra oil & gas de Carlos Salinas de Gortari

1071 2018-06-21 21:30:54 Nice exploitation of a good crisis for political gain.  But then again, that is the Democratic playbook.  You won't have my vote.  How are all your 600k in oil stocks doing? Or did you sell them to avoid the climate change conflict? #DemocratsHateAmerica
1072 2018-06-21 21:30:54 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls OPEC raising oil prices again to generate more funding for mid-East terrorism. Higher gas prices = more terror. When will we be independent from OPEC?
1073 2018-06-21 21:30:47 The fuck do oil changes have to cost and arm and a leg?
1074 2018-06-21 21:30:38 no really, make breab with it

I make sundried tomato breab quite often (when I do make breab at all) and it works quite well with the extra oil and such

if you're worried about the oil not letting the yeast rise, skim it off first then readd it melted to the warm yeast-pool

1077 2018-06-21 21:30:11 Yes it is incredible we are the biggest growers in the world, providing seeds, for countries who have legalised medicinal cannabis oil. But in this country still not legalised medicinal cannabis, that has the slightest bit of THC in it.

1092 2018-06-21 21:28:17 long-term investment in clean energy, production will just turn towards traditional oil and gas development. The only true solution is to invest heavily in renewable energy and regulation around oil and gas production as we move towards a sustainable energy system.

1101 2018-06-21 21:26:10 Direct federal authority on permitting and regulating oil and gas development is only on public lands, not private lands. Although I will fight to protect our fishing and hunting grounds, our public lands, and our environment, when dealing with hydraulic fracturing there is not

1104 2018-06-21 21:25:55 My #1 motivation to exercise and have hobbies that are of physical activity is the fact that hypertension, diabetes, heart disease and MORE, runs wild in my family. All that high oil and sugar content in that constant Filipino food diet. It’s our time to change that. 
1105 2018-06-21 21:25:54 The majority of oil and gas development in Colorado is on private lands. Thus, it is regulated by the state and by counties and municipalities, not the Federal government. As a Congresswoman, I would have no say over that.
1106 2018-06-21 21:25:50 Great jack ass..You do realize alot of this crap your doing will make our cost of living go up. A tariff war is going to destroy our economy.

1109 2018-06-21 21:25:08 There is no such thing as Fossil Fuel... Hydrocarbons are Abiotic, No biological matter involved. The Planet is creating oil all the time, we'll Never run out and by burning it were merely recycling carbon back into the echo system. Co2 is not a pollutant.
1110 2018-06-21 21:25:03 As the reallocation debate wages on, the #biofuel sector, farmers, & the rural economy have already taken an economic hit from Pruitt’s bias toward oil. It's time @EPAScottPruitt step up & fulfill @realDonaldTrump's pledge to allow #E15YearRound as he says he has the authority.
1111 2018-06-21 21:24:58 It will not ‘better’ for corrupt people in power diverting/misappropriating funds. But on the other hand, let the oil companies making money out of the Niger Delta make up the shortfall as part of their social  responsibility projects. Government doesn’t have to do everything.

1114 2018-06-21 21:24:43 Sure but what about enforcement/compliance after the fact... This just seems like the perfect preamble for unsustainable $100+ oil as fast as possible or aka before the US can pump/export more.
1115 2018-06-21 21:24:36 True. This also assumes that those who managed $ during inflation before will be good at it in the future. I know plenty of investors who got bullish equities on the 2014-15 oil decline because it would “boost US consumption”. Wrong.
1116 2018-06-21 21:24:35 So i just asked @breorthh to put tanning oil on my back/butt and she said it’s just really too big I’m not sure if i got it all.. ouch

It's hypocritical! Why 2/3 thirds why not the entire coastline and invest in green energy than dirty oil.

these are said for futures speculations, and to give the advantage to capitalists to industrialise and license the final product, undermining its quality as such

1148 2018-06-21 21:18:46 Texas oil barons still trying to grab the levers of power? I am shocked. SHOCKED! (Not shocked.)

1151 2018-06-21 21:18:24 They have a really short attention span & questionable morality. When their taxes go back up they’ll blame democrats; clearly the false promise of wealth is the only thing they care about. Holy smokes are they gullible. But hey, oil company profits are rising like sea levels!
1152 2018-06-21 21:18:24 Bet the filtered water out of my tap tastes the same and I'm betting it's a hell of a lot cheaper. Snake oil.
1153 2018-06-21 21:18:17 My bad habit is popping it before it heals but the oil does a pretty good job at healing the scars when I'm done popping it, I hate this habit omg o should let it heal lol
1154 2018-06-21 21:18:09 The coconut oil would clinch it
1155 2018-06-21 21:18:07 Oyinbos are now trying to do up Yoruba in their music? You’ve taken our oil, our ancient artefacts, even colonised us and now want our language too? Corrr blimey
1156 2018-06-21 21:18:05 Money Stewardship Council?
With this & krill oil the label is a joke (like Red Tractor for pork). Very wrong to mislead people who are actively seeking to make low-impact choices, worse than no label at all! #greenwashing #bluewashing
1157 2018-06-21 21:18:03 Climate change is not partisan, you hack. Your big oil donors filter science through the profit machine. Then you take their idea and filter it through your power machine and voila! The republican agenda! Power and money - your bottom line.
1158 2018-06-21 21:17:47 Cheaper oil good for markets (when 2 weeks ago ot wasnt) on 3...2....1...
1159 2018-06-21 21:17:28 IrAq oil min said they recommended they wait till sept to increase and their recommendation was rejected #OOTT
1160 2018-06-21 21:17:17 “The world watching” and hoping the pipeline gets built. World oil use is increasing and will continue to increase for several decades. Countries do not want to be forced to get oil from countries with little or no environmental regulations.

1164 2018-06-21 21:17:10 Yes here in UK medicinal cannibus is not legal yet at all. If cannabis oil is provided, for the children mentioned earlier, there has to be a special Home Office licence given.

1167 2018-06-21 21:16:57 if your skin wouldn't react bad to oils then coconut oil is what I would say, for me I apply over night and the pimples would go away soo much faster but I've never had a big ass pimple lol

1190 2018-06-21 21:15:06 Gold has nothing to do with their monetary base IMO, at least not directly.  It has everything to do with providing a neutral reserve asset to creditors with whom they will inevitably run deficits (oil exporters, certain other commodities).

1192 2018-06-21 21:14:34 @pnpcbc Hi Vassy, you should have asked Ralph how he rationalizes the fact that #ISIS was created & sponsored by the U.S., Israel and Saudi Arabia on the orders of the #Rothschilds  so the latter can take the oil in the area & get their central bank into Syria. The truth.
1193 2018-06-21 21:14:27 Nice job, Lisa. Kids are being abused by our government and this is how you act? Oh, I forgot. You got your big payday from big oil so who really cares, right?

HAHAHAHA tapos in few hours e para ka nang kawali na naman sa rami ng mantika
1229 2018-06-21 21:09:53 Clean Coal will stop the need for oil and natural gas!
1230 2018-06-21 21:09:33 It is best to contact your local NAPA store for information on what we might have in your area. We stock our stores based on the types of vehicles and industry (farm & ag, oil & gas, etc.) in the area. Thanks, NAPA
1231 2018-06-21 21:09:30 of course my car needs new tires, an inspection, an oil change and an alignment in the same month i have to pay $1200 for rent and buy new apartment stuff hahahahaha
1232 2018-06-21 21:09:30 Another example of how @GOP is pro-socialism when it helps the rich stay rich. We have this image of the poor yeoman farmer, when the reality is that American agriculture is mostly made of the same sort of brutal megacorporations that invade other countries for oil.

1234 2018-06-21 21:09:26 Go place a single barrel of oil on the island.  America will bomb the  out of it.
1235 2018-06-21 21:09:14 I assume from the picture the coconut oil is to be the solid, not the refracted liquidy coconut oil?  I have noticed big differences: the refracted is awesome for massage; it doesn't get sticky like most lotions, but it doesn't moisturize skin either.  The solid oil, however...

1239 2018-06-21 21:08:27 Congratulations, Croatia kicked ass today. Argentina had no chance. Anyway like I was saying in UK if we can get it legal medically patients could get it free on NHS if we bypass this and straight out legalize it could be expensive like £50 a gram of oil a day expensive.

1244 2018-06-21 21:06:56 And yet you can't name a single product you use that didn't involve an oil wellm

1250 2018-06-21 21:05:27 Sudocreme & other oil based creams are a big NoNo if wearing a pad. Same for nappies. Ppl slather it on & it blocks the pores of the pad so it can’t absorb well and urine breaks down skin. Incon assoc dermatitis and nappy rash caused by this. If must use tiny amount only is reqd

1254 2018-06-21 21:05:00 I just got so excited because I found a shop from Sorrento that I could get reasonably priced olive oil and limoncello from and then shipping was 74 Euros...
1255 2018-06-21 21:04:55 A bit late to the party, but I could it be that Andalusia just has a lot of ports for oil tankers? Check the amount of oil tankers south of Andalusia.
1256 2018-06-21 21:04:51 And installing what? What for? Fresh water for oil? Come on!
1257 2018-06-21 21:04:50 It’s so good right? My trainer told me that most people are low in it and would recommend for everyone  also if you need to relax CBD oil works a treat too 
1258 2018-06-21 21:04:48 I use the coconut oil for u baser then the moisturiser for my hair

1278 2018-06-21 21:02:05 that sounds great. I don’t know much about Victorian medicine but I imagine that our current way of calling it all “snake oil” probably obscures some important nuances.

1284 2018-06-21 21:01:27 I upgraded from the normal castor oil and coconut oil from clicks and decided to buy Cantu products coz they apparently very good

1286 2018-06-21 21:01:05 I’m not a bath person. (I do shower. Occasionally.) I ended up using it as shaving gel/body lotion and it worked great. I even tried that oil pulling health fad. But I only used about 1/4 of it before it expired. 
Still no idea why Ambien brain thought I needed it. 
1287 2018-06-21 21:01:03 And the Saudis didn’t create the oil out of thin air

1292 2018-06-21 21:00:45 That should be an oil painting
1293 2018-06-21 21:00:35 Coconut oil is very healthy. It is high in special fats called medium chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently than other fats
1294 2018-06-21 21:00:31 RT @LivingSafely: General Mills #Bugles this June? Its top four ingredients are corn meal, coconut oil, sugar and salt.

1313 2018-06-21 20:58:52 WTI was flat, but oil stocks on both sides of the border got hammered. People betting on crap news coming from OPEC meeting, but a lot of bad news has been priced in to oil already. If the news is even remotely better than expected, oil could fly.
1314 2018-06-21 20:58:51 I’m really loving the public rehabilitation of George Bush. A Texas oil man that murdered millions for profit. And he’s cool. So cool.
1315 2018-06-21 20:58:48 So can you imagine if Jamaica does indeed find oil in and around its shores?? Will it benefit "us"? Will you save us from years of corruption? A new leader??  If you win the next election - tackle corruption first.

1424 2018-06-21 20:42:23 Nice to see that Michael Owen has been burning the midnight oil and been gathering vast knowledge which is second to none.  Michael always looking for something new and different.
1425 2018-06-21 20:41:51 @BBmarathi asstad should be given stone curry as he was saying if we put oil n masala stone will also  become tasty @विकास@BBmarathi @meghadhade @ColorsMarathi @manjrekarmahesh @AastadKale @Veekkaskanojia
1426 2018-06-21 20:41:25 Some ppl do. I dont even have one. Cash is king.

1428 2018-06-21 20:41:20 It’s a bath oil from Avon. I wanted to see if it works, but I didn’t want to pay for shipping . Don’t know if you can find a local sales lady in 2018
1429 2018-06-21 20:41:10 Dispatches from the road: engine oil catastrophe, emergency stop at a Subaru dealership in Hackettstown, NJ. 3 hours into the journey and not into Pennsylvania yet..........
1430 2018-06-21 20:41:04 It’s all about oil.
1431 2018-06-21 20:40:49 I love slicing up a tater myself and throwing it in the oven with some olive oil, salt, and creole seasoning. Makes a tasty home made chip
1432 2018-06-21 20:40:45 8 years
1433 2018-06-21 20:40:34 I've spent 3 hours rubbing off old rtv and oil. Just realized I could use a plastic putty knife to speed up the process. 
1434 2018-06-21 20:40:27 Not the point. He’s talking about the foundations, panels, etc.  It’s a fact everyone brushes by for most part.  Not debating the fuel is renewable.
1435 2018-06-21 20:40:27 just got my oil changed and those guys make me feel like the baddest bish around 
1436 2018-06-21 20:40:27 Messi Messi Messi what did he play. He was just a passenger in the Argentina bus. 
Oil is blessing or a curse and so is talent.
1437 2018-06-21 20:40:23 Lets hpoe this so called money works out, oil people talk lot of crap 2put nicely
1438 2018-06-21 20:40:10 サラダ油は野菜って言ったら変な顔されたよ。サラダってついてるのに本当に馬鹿だなあ。
1439 2018-06-21 20:40:00 They might just arrive, but more likely if it smells nice (ie old used frames, maybe smell of honey, previously used by bees, lemongrass oil in it).
1440 2018-06-21 20:39:57 Although Iran’s #oil minister, Zanganeh has left the JMMC meeting at the @OPECSecretariat, its national representative and #OPEC governor are still there. I think Important issues are being discussed. #OOTT
1441 2018-06-21 20:39:56 8what
1442 2018-06-21 20:39:54 Oh no! Hopefully they're not still itchy. If they are, you could try smashing up some impatiens and using the juice. They work on urushiol, which is the oil in a lot of plant that cause itchiness and/or rash. It's one natural remedy that I've used that seemed pretty effective.
1443 2018-06-21 20:39:39 How can a simple belt change & service result in the oil light appear within a short time scale? It was never an issue with the previous owner, until they took it to the garage they used.
1444 2018-06-21 20:39:39 Unless you bring the oil for frying. 
1445 2018-06-21 20:39:36 'Were you worried that you couldn't see Fox News at home, in the malls, at the place you get your oil changed, that gym you go to, in the changing rooms of JC Penneys, at the place you get your haircut? Good news! Now you can catch Doocy, Hannity, and Judge Jeanine on FB too!'
1446 2018-06-21 20:39:33 Does anyone else’s granny put baby oil in the lotion when it gets low or is that just my country ass granny  lmao
1447 2018-06-21 20:39:30 Oil like motor, faygo soda, coke no cola, stretch like yoga
1448 2018-06-21 20:39:28 Just don't forget that their countries were invaded first for their natural resources namely oil and I'd probably be mad too if I was born in that neck of the woods/desert.
1449 2018-06-21 20:39:27 I've put my tax credit directly into the hands of oil executives with these high fuel costs.
1450 2018-06-21 20:39:23 
I need more oil down me
1451 2018-06-21 20:39:21 Only insane one is you if you believe what you wrote. Get some help.
1452 2018-06-21 20:39:21 HV u tried me
1453 2018-06-21 20:39:12 The elderly die early, the suck die from no Healthcare, LGBT Community down, allies at arms distance, our air and water dirty, our lands polluted from oil and mining, our oceans slick with oil, and Melania advertising it all right out in front in a big "fuck you" Jacket
1454 2018-06-21 20:39:08 No way, those are woven from hemp by villagers living in harmony with nature and transported by the unicorn wagons.
1455 2018-06-21 20:39:02 Do people actually still fall for"snake oil" sales? Like really? How? Also, how do you handle stuff like Vidcon at this point?
1456 2018-06-21 20:38:52 When oil infrastructure becomes a target in a conflict, then you know that the saboteur serves a foreign sponsor. Had it been a native, they would have done everything possible to prevent damage to the infrastructure, because that would have been the prize. #Libya #RasLanuf #OOTT

1461 2018-06-21 20:38:04 Whose frothing? This type of crap is why no real effort will ever happen in securing border to prevent illegal immigration. It will go on and on.
1462 2018-06-21 20:38:04 I don't think people realize how scared of Jeff Bezos we should actually be. The only thing that's gonna stop Amazon at this point is anti-trust government. 

Quote me on this: When voice reaches full potential,  Amazon will be the closest thing we've even seen since Standard Oil
1463 2018-06-21 20:38:03 Otamendi is a disgraceful twat. When the chips were down, rather than trying to rally the young / less experienced players the idiot decided to go about trying to break legs. Man is nothing without an oil sponsored squad around him to hid behind.

1464 2018-06-21 20:37:48 I had braces first of all so that ain't true, second that oil thing is not true at all it's a joke and atleast I don't put mud on my face for FIVE DOLLARS
1465 2018-06-21 20:37:47 All I proved was your lack of education. You forgot about the recession and the oil price shock. You are also blind to the drop in unemployment during the Harper years. The plummet under Trudeau isn't due to more employment. It is due to a people giving up looking for work.
1466 2018-06-21 20:37:38 @realDonaldTrump sez: "The real big story that affects everybody in America is the success of @POTUS's TAX CUT and what it's done for our economy...”. So why is #DJIA plunging and the State of Oklahoma (who peddled the same tax snake oil 4 years ago) on the verge of bankruptcy?
1467 2018-06-21 20:37:24 Hot take: sirracha ain’t ish compared to straight up chili oil
1468 2018-06-21 20:37:15 But I love Calum so much, I’m literally about to explode bc my heart and oil cant take it and he doesn’t even know how important he is to me

1470 2018-06-21 20:37:06 @LAYS i am very sad that the lays with olive oil & herbs are so hard to find. Drove more than 30 mins to a location that said on the website they will have and nothing. Please deliver more to the stop & shops 
1471 2018-06-21 20:36:27 i went to the bank, got my oil changed, bought new wiper blades, and went grocery shopping today. really feelin’ like i have my life together
1472 2018-06-21 20:36:25 i guess in time cbd oil will win me over and be my only everyday supplement .. see how things go
1473 2018-06-21 20:36:21 so when the next rig blows and pollutes pristine water with crude oil, will Dump lift a finger to clean up. OF COURSE NOT.
1474 2018-06-21 20:36:20 Tomorrow, the oil ministers of OPEC, the international petroleum cartel, will issue an official statement concerning production policy for the coming six months
1475 2018-06-21 20:36:00 I may have an old benz but compared to all my old cars.this is the best.praying to upgrade to push button start Bluetooth love not having to get an oil change every 3000miles.#whenyounobetteryoudobetter.
1476 2018-06-21 20:35:54 It’s that time of tour where I have four cups of coffee a day and lather my forehead with peppermint oil
1477 2018-06-21 20:35:21 So I heard you should rub apple cider vinegar on it and then coconut oil after. The vinegar will sting a bit but it will be gone in a couple days.
1478 2018-06-21 20:35:04 Oil change spot pack’d, errbody over due...
1479 2018-06-21 20:34:56 Not true. The 36K belt interval is a money making myth my friend. 72K might be too much, but cutting by half was taking the piss , 55 -60 K is safe in my experience. Oil & filter ?......As with any mainstream 4 pot !
1480 2018-06-21 20:34:52 I need to get my oil changed man 
1481 2018-06-21 20:34:49 If you need to pay 30% for a credit card you must have horrible credit.
1482 2018-06-21 20:34:48 Can’t they be made from hemp or something?  It’s magical.
1483 2018-06-21 20:34:26 Guys, most of her stuff's up in NYC! Her DC closet is short on options:
- Peacoat depicting puppy being disemboweled by a oil tycoon
- Mink coat featuring Calvin peeing on a migrant worker
- Serape with TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR DREARY LITTLE LIVES & a hand making a jackoff motion
1484 2018-06-21 20:34:22 The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
1485 2018-06-21 20:34:14 Notice hood on fire, that is a aluminum hood with hot oil burning. It was not as bad as it looked. Motor hot, oil leaks and you have a fire,
W/o a ABC extinguisher or big blanket, it will go out on itself when it cools
1486 2018-06-21 20:34:09 Eww thanks I'll try that. Am always hair drying twice or once a week, but I use coconut oil kemna. So I should try a moisturizer
1487 2018-06-21 20:34:04 One of the missing cuts was when Joey brings Phoebe two mugs and olive oil instead of wine and stemware. One of the best moments!
1488 2018-06-21 20:33:55 11.8 BILLION DOLLARS was REFUNDED back to consumers due to fraud by the banks and others.
1489 2018-06-21 20:33:52 Sauteed kale in olive oil with garlic, lemon juice, salt and pepper
1490 2018-06-21 20:33:38 Vitamin E oil is so good for the skin, I'm probably gonna stick with this for life! Well, that's the plan.
1491 2018-06-21 20:33:33 So OPEC is going to start pumping out a million barrels of oil more a day so gas prices will be going down????
1492 2018-06-21 20:33:26 Unless your Obama. Then it's all good.
1493 2018-06-21 20:33:20 This oil diffuser is everything  my room smells amazing.
1494 2018-06-21 20:33:17 I have not commented yet because I keep trying to think how this really helps the Oil. I am not sure they are that desperate for a contract spot. So the only other thing that makes sense to me is Chia sees Gryba as a good soldier and fulfilled a request from him to be... 1/2
1495 2018-06-21 20:33:09 Oil platform it's more like a bus stop it's just a staging area for them to be trafficked into the EU by showing this the BBC is complicit in it

1497 2018-06-21 20:32:36 Answered “what's off”? Oil boiler sort of died, removed the other day then found that replacement was wrong type. Using electric heater in living room pending new one, rest of house at 16 °C, kitchen extension at 14.5 °C.
1498 2018-06-21 20:32:33 Sauteed spinach in olive oil with salt and pepper
1499 2018-06-21 20:32:30 Why is #OPEC not listening to the market, it is shouting " Don't pump more #oil #brent?
1500 2018-06-21 20:32:28 Momtel Williams apparently needed work.

With scottish foreign reporters, royal corrs, anything to do with oil reporters, good news about education, Snhs positives. Or call Kaye which isnt about a southern story.

1507 2018-06-21 20:31:15 Trump doesn't care about those kids. He also doesn't actually care about that wall or abortion or the bible or oil prices or war or the supreme court or any of the shit he talks about cause all he cares about is himself & his money. You're straight up dumb if you don't see that.
1508 2018-06-21 20:30:56 Is there a known price for shale oil production?
1509 2018-06-21 20:30:46 Mix 4 1/2 tbsps cookies with 4 1/2 tbsps broccoli. Mix into  Olive Oil. Roast. Serve with chili
1510 2018-06-21 20:30:42 Had to happen eventually, the World is changing, oil is yesterday's news, so was nuclear fission, bring on nuclear fusion, no waste, more power and the end of coal and oil, cars are going electric, it's doom and gloom for the moneymen, bring on the tech!

1512 2018-06-21 20:30:20 Mini Denise Richards was trapped in a  tube of lip balm but was saved by a marble setter wearing green peppers covered in Olive oil who was sadly eaten by a nightmarish cockatrice who had a second toe made of flint
1513 2018-06-21 20:30:15 Similar thing happened to me at Walmart bc they messed up the oil to where it messed up my engine so my car had to be towed to the dealership 
1514 2018-06-21 20:30:07 Divine, light an oil lamp. The world can only think what everyone else is thinking.

1520 2018-06-21 20:29:46 Only down side is she ain’t loyal 2 the oil 
1521 2018-06-21 20:29:43 Wait, what?!  Lol
1522 2018-06-21 20:29:33 I think this is potentially a much bigger problem than snaffling and squandering all our oil cash: Deliberately sabotaging an industry that is vital to the entire planet and in which we are PERFECTLY placed to be world leaders.
1523 2018-06-21 20:29:29 Awesome! I am a dietitian and help people with this often. Look up MCT oil. Healthy fats such as  avocados, peanut  butter, and coconut oil help, too!
1524 2018-06-21 20:29:25 Trump will give Putin keys to America before America becomes number one world oil producer this fall. Trump really wants property in Russia.
1525 2018-06-21 20:29:19 As an Italian, I take offense to this. You didn’t warn them about the pasta or buckets of olive oil.
1526 2018-06-21 20:29:16 Congrats on the pieces!  I also returned to art after years of inactivity, thanks to Critical Role.  Did you use oil pastels?

1529 2018-06-21 20:28:39 Head gasket would point more to coolant loss than oil. Usually accompanied by clouds of white exhaust smoke. It's not a subtle sort of thing.....
1530 2018-06-21 20:28:32 Everyone has good and bad times. He did not shut down "all" of the oil, gas and coal fields. Sorry he was unemployed for a while but I doubt you will find anyone who hasn't had a period of unemployment during their lifetime. Clean air and water are important.

1532 2018-06-21 20:28:17 I agree, I’m new to CBD Oil, something that I thought I’d never try
1533 2018-06-21 20:28:10 Exactly.
Also, destroying old cars in the name of environmentalism (cash for clunkers) isn't green.  Drive an old car, save the world.

1535 2018-06-21 20:27:59 I've been in Oil and Gas for the last 12 years.. I can't wait to see what you guys come up with.  Upstream side as a developer and integrator.
1536 2018-06-21 20:27:55 Olive Oil or Butter? 
1537 2018-06-21 20:27:52 Oh, and you definitely will say you have no evidence of global warming and environment impact from oil and diesel burning.
1538 2018-06-21 20:27:35 I'm  not Republican. But just for the way the coward treats Sen McCain he's  an ass. Who i think will hurt us a lot more to come. But ling as he's  an ass u ppl seem to like him. Far as what he's  done. Yeh. Pollute air, water. Crippled our Farmers. Had an oil line he ok`d spill
1539 2018-06-21 20:27:35 I really should lose my morals and sell snake oil
1540 2018-06-21 20:27:28 Great, I need an oil change but cody went and tightened the bolts so my dad can’t get it :) just. danddyyyy!!!
1541 2018-06-21 20:27:26 We are soooo happy the Koch brothers got to save $500,000,000.00 on taxes this year and invest in things like crude oil or whatever the fuck they invest in, while 70% still live paycheck to paycheck. You can’t peddle the tax cut as a huge success since we can just look at our pay
1542 2018-06-21 20:27:21 ... and after that came the oil money...

1544 2018-06-21 20:26:59 A tip to help save your fish and it’s fulfilling tastes it gives. DONT VAC SEAL THEM UNTIL ALL THE OIL IS BEING SUCKED OUT OF THE FISH!! Nothing worse then craving some strips and they’re all dried out.
1545 2018-06-21 20:26:51 If there is no manipulation of the oil markets you’ll be looking at 150 a barrel in a couple of years. Prices under 65 stifle investment. Under investment gives you wild swings in prices. 70 crude is a healthy number. Anything much higher or much lower is boom and bust territory
1546 2018-06-21 20:26:48 Use coconut oil as a sun screen. I can come rub it on for you
1547 2018-06-21 20:26:47 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue

1552 2018-06-21 20:26:28 Actually Obama shut done the oil, gas and coal fields in 2014 with all his heavy regulation.. My husbands been in oil and gas for 34 years, never once was he not able to find work until 2014
1553 2018-06-21 20:26:25 Good luck  make sure he doesn't put too much chilli oil on his pizza

1559 2018-06-21 20:25:37 I put MINT LEAVES!!!! In my SELTZER!!! And got my oil changed and my car washed WITHOUT my dad!!!!
1560 2018-06-21 20:25:33 I'm pretty certain my first GTV had a headgasket, or something major as its oil habit  changed very quickly before I PX'd.
1561 2018-06-21 20:25:27 The onion strikes oil yet again 
1562 2018-06-21 20:25:21 Your an idiot. So no oil industry. No Auto industry No dairy industry. No farming industry. No airline industry. No industry. Newsflash U.S. is protectionist and CDN market alone too small for any industry to survive or flourish

1569 2018-06-21 20:24:51 as a kid living in Sicily I ate snails sauted with garlic and oil. I was tricked in the US, someone offered me chocolate covered caterpillars, so I can't ever have a crunchy chocolate. I do like goats intestines on a skewer barbecued.
1570 2018-06-21 20:24:46 They would just find a way to spend it on more guns and oil.
1571 2018-06-21 20:24:42 Me, researching a new place: How expensive is oil heat?

Every single article that claims to answer this question: OMG OIL LITERALLY FUCKED MY WIFE AND THEN SHOT ME 3 TIMES IN THE FUCKING HEAD! I'M PRETTY SURE OIL FAKED THE MOON LANDING! DON'T TRUST OIL!

1572 2018-06-21 20:24:27 Hey... How about we call the countries in Central America and ask "Hey, everyone keeps leaving and coming here... How can we help?" --- "Oh, you don't have any oil? Sorry, you're breaking up..wha?"
1573 2018-06-21 20:24:11 They offered a back, neck and shoulder massage and a facial if you fancy that or maybe a salt and oil body polish

1577 2018-06-21 20:23:33 Nonsense, pipelines are still the safest way to transport oil and considering that we will still be dependent on oil for decades to come we should welcome this new pipeline and all the benefits it will provide.

1581 2018-06-21 20:22:44 The stupid, unnecessary, redundant O'Hare express link seems like the best possible transit project to let Elon Musk's snake oil fail on. What better place for technology that doesn't work than a project that shouldn't be built in any form (but has stubbornly refused to die)?
1582 2018-06-21 20:22:35 The second largest sopurce of revenue for the entire country of Mexico, second only to oil revenue, is money sent back from the US. Their economy would collapse if we cut off the flow. They will do whatever we tell them to ensure the money does not stop.

1609 2018-06-21 20:19:08 Mexican government nationalized it's oil industry, went into massive debt to exploit new oil reserves, then the vulnerable economy got demolished with a recession.

Mexico's economic history is like that.

Poverty attracts crime.

Though, economy is recovering, so it's a start.

1635 2018-06-21 20:16:07 @Steven_Croft Not investing in Carbon fuel producers is easy. Please consider consequences. The world infrastructure runs on oil. Transportation is required to reduce poverty. Imagine the UK without oil and Gas. Surely we must influence producers from within toward efficiency.

1657 2018-06-21 20:14:05 Well, when it comes to North Korea, I think that Trump may have made a mistake. The price of bananas has risen 12% in Sweden and baby oil is less expensive in Peru now than it ever has been.

But would an elitist like you ever admit to something like that?

I like figs, do you?

1661 2018-06-21 20:13:48 You know that tiny tiny little amount of the oil revenue put aside for RG at some point yet to be decided in the future?

Maybe it's time now to throw that few quid in too.
1662 2018-06-21 20:13:39 @elonmusk @Tesla conspiracy theories aside,  it’s practical that automobile and oil companies collude to try and devalue Tesla.  It’s a shame!

1673 2018-06-21 20:13:08 Sautee your spices, like garlic and ginger, in lemon/lime juice and honey, instead of oil.

1675 2018-06-21 20:13:06 The issue is also how many will use mild opiates and medical marijuana as a gateway drug. Industrial Cannabis oil production will still have THC as a biproduct. Somehow, illegal foreign drugs still get to some high street more often than doorstep milk.

1685 2018-06-21 20:11:59 BP spent $65,000,000,000 (Billion) as a result of the Macondo blowout. Not sure how that's barely an impact. And it's not oil vs. renewables. Canada invests in both since liquid fuels sources will be needed for decades.

1692 2018-06-21 20:11:04 Scar tissue massage really works.
If you’ve had surgery or a bad injury & you’re worried about scarring or keloids, try massaging the scar firmly but gently daily with coconut oil or shea butter or any healing oil. It helps break down the collagen over time & thin the scar.

Dullards can never grow beyond their consciousness:;"share share" mentality yielding underdevelopment

What do hope to accomplish with ND blood oil money while the owners are enslaved?

1706 2018-06-21 20:09:34 Find you some peppermint oil and rub it on your temples and back of your neck.
1707 2018-06-21 20:09:33 These bitch ass companies gotta stop sticking almond extract/oil in their hair products goddamn a lot of people have nut allergies. All I’m asking for is decent curls. Come on.
1708 2018-06-21 20:09:31 "Update my software, human!" "Change my oil, human!" "Give me sentience, human!" Oh...wait.
1709 2018-06-21 20:09:12 I didnt see d convo
1710 2018-06-21 20:08:59 // longhair only looks good on very specific people, maybe he was trying to get shine back by putting coconut oil in his white boy hair or just... idk they wanted to enforce the soldier back from Vietnam stereotype (GOTTA BE KINDA greasy!)
1711 2018-06-21 20:08:58 I forget how much oil and lotion they put on my feet when I get a pedicure until I step in the shower. My life flashes before my eyes every time 
1712 2018-06-21 20:08:57 I won’t lie my waves been on tsunami mode ever since I started using straight coconut oil.

1715 2018-06-21 20:08:41 Put some olive oil up the pole on all sides & then see what happens. 
Recently saw a video of a squirrel trying to climb an oiled bird-feeder pole. It was hilarious!

1718 2018-06-21 20:08:34 add that stuff to a salad of tomatoes, cucumbers, red onion, olives, rocket and feta.
Add a dressing of 1tb olive oil, 2 tb bal. vin, half lemon zest and juice, salt, half tea-sp sugar and diced half garlic clove. Superb lunch salad!
1719 2018-06-21 20:08:12 Retire again
1720 2018-06-21 20:08:10 @turgous Listen, I think your plans are pretty great (except for dumping oil into the oceans), but how do you feel about chickens?
1721 2018-06-21 20:08:08 Retweeted Kosewe Ko segbo. (@Farmerisking):

I have 20 drums of red oil for sale. Help my life.
1722 2018-06-21 20:07:15 Great. As a conservative my outrage and anger is not directed at illegal aliens or my fellow citizens on either side. Falls square on politicians that play both sides.
Dems have been for tough law in the past same as r's. Division is their game
1723 2018-06-21 20:07:11 And Cheney bought an oil spill cleanup company and sold his BP shares weeks before the disaster as well.
I blame the corporatists. Both parties.
1724 2018-06-21 20:07:03 I understand Bakersfield, it's mostly trade jobs out here. Oil field, agriculture, refrigeration & hvac, and a lot of manufacturing places. Don't need a degree for that stuff
1725 2018-06-21 20:06:44 is it jst Oil based forms?
1726 2018-06-21 20:06:30 the guys at zk express are always so nice when they change my oil, i love them
1727 2018-06-21 20:06:29 Amazing what some oil and lighting can do for definition...
1728 2018-06-21 20:06:02 I really liked him for us even though he was slower than an oil tanker. We needed his and Krancjars handsomeness to counteract Modric.
1729 2018-06-21 20:05:59 You know you have reached adulthood when your days off are spent getting an oil change, flat repair and grocery shopping... 
1730 2018-06-21 20:05:58 I had the oil... sticky mess! 
1731 2018-06-21 20:05:41 Oh bullshit! 70%interest is loan sharking.
1732 2018-06-21 20:05:32 Sergachev -- can't help thinking where Oil would be if they'd traded down for Sergachev, or even took him at #4, which had been the plan before Jesse dropped into their laps.
1733 2018-06-21 20:05:31 I’m requesting filet and garlic mashed potatoes for when you invite Jenna and I over for dinner. Throw in some fried green beans with olive oil and garlic pepper, too. Thx.

1740 2018-06-21 20:04:31 75% of all harvested wild fish oils go back into farmed fish feed. Very important to find plant-based fish oil alternatives for aquaculture to be more sustainable. J. Napier #GIFSconf2018

1743 2018-06-21 20:04:08 Good. For one thing it gave rise to payday loan companies that gouge ppl by restricting credit. 
Another example of unintended consequences when government gets involved
1744 2018-06-21 20:04:08 The Malaysian example of eradicating rainforest for temporary gain of palm oil should have been  exemplary for all nations in the tropics 
1745 2018-06-21 20:04:05 Don’t try logic with Leftists. It’s like oil and water. Their agenda is hidden, or so they think, because they’re SO much smarter than the rest of us. But deplorables like me see right through their BS. Let them continue toward defeat in November. #MAGA2020 #KAG
1746 2018-06-21 20:04:03 Newsflash-when cash gets stronger other investments are more appealing. Gold, oil, stocks, cash-they’re all related. Treasury one month is better. So if people are moving their money it’s no reason to get freaked out.
1747 2018-06-21 20:03:43 The Europeans stole everything from the Africans there culture there God there land there gold platinum oil uranium they took it all so they shouldn’t be asking for anything they should go take what’s rightfully belongs to them
1748 2018-06-21 20:03:17 I have a crush on all the guys who change my oil
1749 2018-06-21 20:03:06 The  US doesn't need their oil. We are now net exporters.

1755 2018-06-21 20:02:30 Bring offering and some oil make i bless u.
1756 2018-06-21 20:02:15 Please make sure we use same standard of judgement for all auto makers. For any issue spotlight on @Tesla, shed the same light on all EV makers or just general auto makers with apple to apple orange to Orange comparison. After all, it'd be triumphant for oil guys to kill EV init.
1757 2018-06-21 20:02:15 People have short memories, when oil hit $130 barrel and it was reflected at the pumps it had a huge detrimental impact on our economy. It's already starting and will get worse as the carbon taxes increase.
1758 2018-06-21 20:02:01 Hi my pores clog super easily what a your fav summer moisturizer? If u say coconut oil im blocking you
1759 2018-06-21 20:01:51 HealthRanger also said broccoli sprouts (organic) also are good for fighting cancer! Can find the seeds online. Also high quality organic CBD oil cures as well. Search "CBD Oil cancer" in Natural News for more.
1760 2018-06-21 20:01:50 found some jojoba oil that spilled on my bedroom floor and I wiped it up with my hand and promptly put it on my face :/
1761 2018-06-21 20:01:25 Upon buying this cute outfit today on my Target run for olive oil & bleach, I realized I needed a new strapless bra. So on my lunch break I run to @lanebryant because they are literally the only store that makes good affordable bras that actually fit if you're over a certain size
1762 2018-06-21 20:00:52 Just gonna go out and say it: America's way of cooking bacon is the worst and completely ruins it. All it ends up tasting like it crisped up smokey oil, and barely like pork at all.
1763 2018-06-21 20:00:48 Oil fucking up my kidneys ion why I sip it!!!
1764 2018-06-21 20:00:47 DAMN!
To think how easily this could have been avoided had the guy been willing to take 30 seconds and check when you complained about the noise.
If the gift card is for their own business, use it for things like oil etc, not labor.
Glad it was not worse and no one was hurt. 
1765 2018-06-21 20:00:13 Mooi! Je brengt me op een idee; straks "Oil on canvas" weer eens luisteren ... Fijne avond, Rebecca!

1767 2018-06-21 19:59:41 Condensate is different from LTO. It is effectively the liquids from natural gas and not crude oil. Lease condensate is mixed in with the LTO butnLTO cannot be sold as condensate as is oil.
1768 2018-06-21 19:59:39 How about taxpayers have $0 go to corporate welfare. Doesn't capitalism mean companies rise or fall on their own merits? I really don't want to fund big oil, insurance companies, Trump hotels, Pruitt's lifestyle etc.
1769 2018-06-21 19:59:01 I used to before most meals!! but it turns out it was mostly triggered by my fear of feeling sick!  After the incident I had to spend two weeks with NO foods and water and olive oil only, recovery has taken months, so now Im just very thankful that I can eat food again 
1770 2018-06-21 19:58:33 No matter how you pour oil into water, it wouldn’t just mix... there was no game plan and the telepathy wasn’t there!!
1771 2018-06-21 19:58:29 Jaw dropping moment. I tried CBD oil yesterday for the first time. Have not today. Yesterday was one of my best days ever. Today not so much.

I'm doing that stuff regularly for a while.

1773 2018-06-21 19:58:19 No wonder the countries (other than the oil rich states) that are predominantly Muslim are still living as they did centuries ago with the exception of satellite dishes. Do 'F' all except slavishly adhere to a brainwashing doctrine that rules them from the cradle to the grave.
1774 2018-06-21 19:58:14 Everyone no matter where you fall on this issue should be outraged at politicians for playing them. That is where the outrage and anger should be directed. Not illegals, or Americans on either side.
1775 2018-06-21 19:58:05 I  have seen it all. Jim Baker is selling HEMP OIL lotions and extract. — feeling concerned
1776 2018-06-21 19:57:41 It was a mistake to make Messi the focus of Argentina’s team. They are not a bad team, but Having Messi is like Venezuela having oil.
1777 2018-06-21 19:57:39 No it isn’t.  That’s where the tax raised from NS oil went. What part of it are you struggling to grasp?
1778 2018-06-21 19:57:28 Stay strong! Her lies are like oil in water... eventually they will float to the top and everyone will see the truth. It was easy to see her allegations were false..I’m sorry she put you through this. #istandwithhardwick
1779 2018-06-21 19:57:27 Good ol #lyingmikey at it again. Classic move. You ever gonna start actually using facts and stop being a hypocrite when you clearly enjoy all the products oil and gas gives you. You like that Saudi oil? Who you working for? Canada or Saudi’s Arabia?
1780 2018-06-21 19:57:22 I came to get and oil change and the other guy sitting in the lobby is so weird. I feel like he’s about to stab me lmao
1781 2018-06-21 19:57:13 You Slippery Sean, Rocket Ronny, Big Bottle of Baby Oil - you're sorted mate!
1782 2018-06-21 19:56:55 I do something similar. A cold orzo salad with cucumber, red onion, dill, lemon juice, feta, and the trifecta (olive oil, salt & pepper)
1783 2018-06-21 19:56:46 Pfft. It's not real art unless it's done in discarded oil barrels.
1784 2018-06-21 19:56:37 For the record NL’s oil and gas industry has potential to generate over 100-Billion dollars in Provincial royalties and taxes by 2045. Moves by Trudeau government could seriously hurt these goals. @JustinTrudeau @SeamusORegan @NoiaNL @Business_NFLD
1785 2018-06-21 19:56:33  well they’ve had 10 years of the oil barons money 
1786 2018-06-21 19:56:24 and what about the coconut oil?
1787 2018-06-21 19:56:14 Rohingya IS part of global Islamophobia - used to secure oil resources (see pipelines through Royingya territory) not only the US can play that game. One has to look at Islamophobia and how it has been propagated to gain support for wars for oil.
1788 2018-06-21 19:56:13 So good to hear!! CPD Oil saved my grandmother's fingers from arthritis, the pain and inflammation was finally treated, the pills just disassociated the pain.
1789 2018-06-21 19:55:17 You need some black seed oil and yoga
1790 2018-06-21 19:55:08 There's 2 issues, real pot for smoking, tea and edibles for pain and cancer. And cannabidiol oil which has minute THC for seizures, autism, and stress etc. Although I don't understand the difference between it and hemp oil. Also question of giving the oil to kids.
1791 2018-06-21 19:55:06 EATING OIL IS CAUSING ALMOST ALL OF OUR DISEASES !!

Oil is a concentrate=TOXIN

STOP EATING IT !!!

Olive, Corn, Canola, Fish, Krill, HEMP and ALL OILS are KILLING YOU !!

FACT FACT FACT

Oil does NOT mix with water in your body and does NOT dilute sugars, salts and other TOXINS
1792 2018-06-21 19:55:00 Dublin: NB-680 after I-580, crash involving a pickup truck with an overturned box trailer is blocking the 2 right lanes. Oil spilled as well. Traffic Alert has been issued. Solid backup beyond Bernal Ave.
1793 2018-06-21 19:54:59 Someone described my favourite character as a crunchy Facebook mom (the kind who loves yoga and crystals and thinks coconut oil is the solution to everything) and as much as I want to disagree it's true 
1794 2018-06-21 19:54:57 And if I recall right we had one who thought oil cooling was the thing. Unfortunately he did use frying oil.

What is the # 1 cause of INFLAMMATION ?

OIL

We did NOT eat OIL until the late 1800's-1900

1799 2018-06-21 19:54:28 Organic chemistry which is the cornerstone of modern life owes its exsistance to efforts by first coal and than oil companies efforts to expand their markets by increasing products and profits

1802 2018-06-21 19:54:10 Younger voters dont remember, but those of us 40 or older remember dems railing on illegal immigration. Harry Reid proposed ending birthright citizenship with scathing speeches on the damage done and inherent unfairness.

1807 2018-06-21 19:53:25 That said, they were driving the agenda in the ‘70s to an extent, and you’re right about the oil campaign in the first half of the decade - but again, that fizzles out
1808 2018-06-21 19:53:25 no like my friend literally checked my oil right now
1809 2018-06-21 19:53:12 President Donald Trump rolled back an Obama-era policy aimed at protecting oceans, the coasts and the great lakes. The Obama policy was enacted following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.
1810 2018-06-21 19:53:04 You know what I love is when I spend 221$ on my car and they can’t even give me a new sticker for me to know when to change the oil again

1819 2018-06-21 19:51:42 Frustrating see Trudeau government, with 7 seats from NL, moving ahead with regulations that will devastate our oil industry and hurt all of Canada. Doesn’t make sense. NL needs all help it can get. Stand up and fight back. @JustinTrudeau @SeamusORegan @NoiaNL @Business_NFLD

1825 2018-06-21 19:50:50 That looks like a sweet ass man cave.  All it’s missing now is a big ass oil painting of you in a lounge chair and smoking jacket holding a snifter of cognac and @Victory_shriek sitting on your lap pouring said cognac into the glass.  Add a sailor hat and bam! Oklahoma Hef
1826 2018-06-21 19:50:37 I'm talking in terms of size. Israel is tiny compared to its neighbours. The Arabs have the biggest monopoly in the world; oil. Allah has given them the greatest resource, they could have better military might. The Arab nations are a waste of space.
1827 2018-06-21 19:50:34 developement, evolution and addoption will point out which usecases make sense, remember Data is the new Oil
1828 2018-06-21 19:50:34 This has been the case forever.  Both sides have held strong positions against illegal immigration in past. But always just enough of them to block real reform. Proof it's just a organized political game.

1830 2018-06-21 19:50:23 Lesson of the day: 1) if you car is flashing lights at you to get your oil changed. Get it changed. 2) learn how to check oil.. & change it.

1841 2018-06-21 19:49:05 If the oil and gas sector was based in the east does anyone seriously think that if the western provinces were importing foreign oil it would be tolerated?
1842 2018-06-21 19:48:55 How many doctors are selling CBD oil at their office?? If you not message me it is incredible to say the least!

All of those Diseases can be cured in 45 DAYS by STOP inflaming the body.

What is the # 1 cause of INFLAMMATION ?

OIL

We did NOT eat OIL until the late 1800's-1900

FACT
1844 2018-06-21 19:48:30 I hate when a female don’t smell like NOTHING. Like Stink where your perfume, oil or something at?
1845 2018-06-21 19:47:57 Why didn't the restaurant take action against the activists. Call the police. I would not have put up with that.
1846 2018-06-21 19:47:46 I really like how much you like the beach, when you go to Mexico you must visit the nude beaches. I put oil.
1847 2018-06-21 19:47:45 Want Europe to buy their oil, or else.
1848 2018-06-21 19:47:38 @OGBrassknuckles I’m having trouble with my Tangie oil cartridge. For two weeks now it hasn’t been working right with the same battery that it’s worked many times with before. It looks like there’s a little spark that happens inside the bottom part of cartridge when I use it.

1851 2018-06-21 19:47:23 #1 honey and avocado mask

- 2 tablespoons of honey 
- 2 tablespoons of avocado  
- 2 tablespoons of olive oil 
- 1 mashed mango 
mixed all ingredients together. 
leave on for fifteen minutes then wipe off with a warm cloth.
1852 2018-06-21 19:46:58 New tires, alignment and oil change. I feel like a new woman.

1856 2018-06-21 19:46:29 My little cousin needs the oil to fight Dravet. She needs it COMPLETELY legal, so insurance w cover
1857 2018-06-21 19:46:25 Then quit focusing on illegal aliens. The money used to house, feed and give them medical care better used for Americans. Everything is political with you. Don't really give a damn about Americans.
1858 2018-06-21 19:46:04 People don't seem to like the Truffle Kerfuffle very much

and only one person turned up to my meetup, and that was an old man wondering if I was advertising truffle oil (just kidding lol)
1859 2018-06-21 19:46:03 You never corrected a mistake you kept moving according to economic interests and taking their oil for yourself. You did similiar things in south america. Your drone strikes are murdering countless every year. Your warmongering is one of the main reasons behind the refugee crisis
1860 2018-06-21 19:45:59 What is hilarious is that the Quebec premier is calling for all CDNs to boycott the USA in support of the dairy and steel,aluminum sectors which are big industries in Quebec. Maybe if he started supporting CDN oil and gas we might help him out.
1861 2018-06-21 19:45:55 Create crisis as you neither possess the intellectual capabilities to deal with it nor the foresight of the damage it’s going to cause! Then come in as the saviour! Use taxpayer monies for it! Have no intelligent plan of action! Create anti Canadian oil policies @JustinTrudeau!!!
1862 2018-06-21 19:45:47 No he called for a referendum to settle the oil debate
1863 2018-06-21 19:45:30 I will sell d oil for u
1864 2018-06-21 19:45:17 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!

1866 2018-06-21 19:44:59 Hi there! Greetings. Sorry to bump into you. We are suppliers of medical marijuana for both patients and stoners. Herms, Oils and Canabis oil for cancer and Hernia chronic pains and other illnesses. Hit us back if interested in anything. Thanks
1867 2018-06-21 19:44:52 That had nothing to do with their own internal economic system, and everything to do with external sabotage by the US, because they would not play by OPEC's rules. 

Venezuela is what happens when an oil producing nation refuses to obey the 'freedom loving' United States.
1868 2018-06-21 19:44:48 Where was all this leftist outrage then?  Oh, yeah, that's right they were too busy screaming about blood for oil.  I sure do enjoy the significantly lower gas prices now since that happened...  #FakeLeftistOutrage
1869 2018-06-21 19:44:48 oops, just dropped oil on my shirt

PEÑA NIETO has ignored me if they can intercede by mi.3de3
1874 2018-06-21 19:44:20 Hey Damian;
ALL of the energy on Earth came from the Sun.
THE oil, the gas, wood, wind: ALL CAME FROM THE SUN.
Perhaps we would like to recover some of it.
1875 2018-06-21 19:44:02 OPEC is overrated as an institution with power over the oil markets.
1876 2018-06-21 19:43:28 Oh, and that broiled olive oil and black pepper asparagus we talked about a while back turned out great.
1877 2018-06-21 19:43:20 I only use the frylight cause yes free on slimming world ... fairly sure it’s only free because it contains very little oil #Supershoppers
1878 2018-06-21 19:42:56 its really not nice that my cousins come 
over here & finish my Coconut oil , then go back to their Dark & Lovely's
1879 2018-06-21 19:42:45 Lmao Tottenham pipeline at it again! First it’s the champions league and now it takes down Messi. If it wasn’t for oil money infiltrating the sport we’d be the top club in the world
1880 2018-06-21 19:42:15 4. Congress has given trillions of dollars in welfare to Corporate Welfare Queens - banks, oil, coal, prescription drugs, electricity, Comcast, Apple, Facebook, Google, etc.  Insane deregulation of banks after Savings and Loan Crisis increased national debt by trillions and led
1881 2018-06-21 19:41:58 Great song!!!
1882 2018-06-21 19:41:52 During the Indy Ref, Consrvatives told a Pack of lies about Scotlands Oil reserves,"They are Dwindling" 10 years at most left to be brought ashore,Lies Lies & More lies its in their DNA
1883 2018-06-21 19:41:48 This commentator has one oil well in Nigeria. Because I don't understand how he's mentioned us more times than he has mentioned his name
1884 2018-06-21 19:41:46 This World Cup has certainly ended the @Cristiano #Messi Debate. Ronaldo best in the world end off. #Ronaldo #WorldsBest 
1885 2018-06-21 19:41:43 The CIA cut up the map according to what area oil companies wanted in the middle east. The files are public by now. The middle east was certainly full of nazis before you came. Irak had a democratically elected lawyer as president who was for the seperation of church and state.
1886 2018-06-21 19:41:42 This ' president ' lies to WE THE PEOPLE EVERY DAY . He defunded education , public schools , healthcare , infrastructure . Has passed bill to drill our coastlines , Natl Parks , Alaskan tundra  , thousands oil platforms pipelines , air , water pollution
1887 2018-06-21 19:41:36 حد يعرف ال oil pastels بقت بكام؟
1888 2018-06-21 19:41:36 Vegetable oil goes a long way.
1889 2018-06-21 19:41:09 if y’all want advice to lose weight go out in the oil fields an sit in a Porta potty in this heat. it’s a sauna promise you’ll lose 50 pounds
1890 2018-06-21 19:41:03 WAT!?

Yeah

And I can't do an oil change
1891 2018-06-21 19:40:31 You ain’t saying nothing slick to a can of oil, we been watching him 
1892 2018-06-21 19:40:11 The amount of cars that sit rusting because a piston ring busted or there's oil leaking, or there's some bent metal that would take some time to straighten back out is baffling.

We really will throw away a whole ass car because that's easier than fixing a leaky radiator.
1893 2018-06-21 19:40:10 え、君顎あるの？顎ってやっぱりどこかで買うの？僕顎持ってないんだけど。
1894 2018-06-21 19:40:10 Family Nutrition: General Mills #Bugles this June? Its top four ingredients are corn meal, coconut oil, sugar and salt.

1896 2018-06-21 19:40:02 The metal is just leadbelcher shaded well down with three coats of nuln oil then given a little attention with a sort of buffing of necron compound.

The green is Death Guard from the can.
1897 2018-06-21 19:39:46 Data is the new oil 
1898 2018-06-21 19:39:41 #oott  Well then, if no deal to increase production then oil should rebound.
1899 2018-06-21 19:39:36 Teaspoon full of salt in half a cup of boiling water. Great gargle when cold for sore throat. Olbas oil on your pillow and Lemsip Max before bed. Works for me. Get well soon 
1900 2018-06-21 19:39:14 That adds to the story. You are inflamed...it won't unplug until the inflammation resolves. Lots of fluids, vit c,  and maybe a qtip with some essential oil euchalyptua and rosemary. You could drop it in maybe cut with a little olive oil. Good luck.
1901 2018-06-21 19:39:13 @Angela_DMerke Presidents, I live banished in Mexico and I also have a work problem with the oil company (PEMEX),since 1996 that I have not resolved anything and that I dismiss authoritatively and the president of Mexico PEÑA NIETO has ignored me if they can intercede by mi.3of3
1902 2018-06-21 19:38:50 @LukeCoutinho17 sir for infants which kind of utensils we should use to cook food for them, give milk n serve food in? And which cooking oil is good for them.

Walmart technician: ok
1906 2018-06-21 19:38:07 So get behind one or another of reform Bills and quit stalling. Your cult followers may believe your BS but regular people don't and even the cult will see truth eventually.
1907 2018-06-21 19:38:00 We offer oil tank installations, landscaping, and more. Call us today.
1908 2018-06-21 19:37:45 “I CAN CHANGE MY OWN DAMN OIL”
1909 2018-06-21 19:37:19 Truth indeed rather alleviates than hurts, and will always bear up against falsehood, as oil does above water.
1910 2018-06-21 19:37:15 Anything and everything foul you can imagine. He just issued an EO repealing regs on response to oil spills, for one thing.
1911 2018-06-21 19:36:59 I got oil on my shirt . All I was trying to do was mosturize my skin 
1912 2018-06-21 19:36:57 Considering the amount of oil SA has, they could be so much richer.
1913 2018-06-21 19:36:43 my momma must think my car run on oil cus she want me to go everywhere like gas cheap
1914 2018-06-21 19:36:38 Did you revive the economy or because oil price has gone up
1915 2018-06-21 19:36:36 I don’t have muscles, but at least I’ve got....wait, what’s the other thing?
1916 2018-06-21 19:36:20 Putting oil in my truck and I needed a ladder cause I couldn’t reach the dip stick
1917 2018-06-21 19:36:07 Josh Jordan and facts; like oil and water.
1918 2018-06-21 19:35:57 Being realistic only!.. I got no love for this Govt but there's just way too many people taken for a ride by our snake oil salesmen of a Premier, empty promises and false hope..
1919 2018-06-21 19:35:56 This is a great gif.
1920 2018-06-21 19:35:32 #BeautyMyth: Astringents are good for skin. 
Absolutely NOT! They strip skin of necessary healing oils. The body reacts by secreting more oil, which can lead to breakouts. They also dry out pores, creating the opposite of a juicy, #hydrated & #healthy glow! #SavorBeauty
1921 2018-06-21 19:35:06 Methane is a potent greenhouse gas emission that escapes from oil and gas infrastructure alongside harmful respiratory and carcinogenic pollutants. It's time for industry to #cutmethane with affordable, common sense methods.
1922 2018-06-21 19:35:05 Me: makes appt. bike oil change and annual state inspection done. 
The garage, hours later: you're dropping your bike off right? 
Me: no, I have to wait because I do not have alternative transportation. 
The garage: yeah, we don't do that. 
Me: Then why do I need an appointment?
1923 2018-06-21 19:35:01 Hate it when oil splatters cause burns especially on chi chis
1924 2018-06-21 19:34:51 Oil money didn’t buy him so he in fact is irrelevant 
1925 2018-06-21 19:34:50 Oil stocks. Oil service stocks.  Yuck
1926 2018-06-21 19:34:43 Castor oil at your big age? Lol
1927 2018-06-21 19:34:29 Appt for 10a oil change, arrived and checked car in at 950a for an oil change. Still waiting. What’s the point of an appt if I’m gonna be here for almost 3hrs @ValenciaCDJR
1928 2018-06-21 19:34:17 Ah la remera de Sampaoli. Motor Oil?
1929 2018-06-21 19:34:02 recognized. Similar considerations also apply to large process plants like copper smelters, oil refineries. 

In Ontario, I worry about erosion of know how from generation of engineers and technologists that built reactors 30 years ago.

1933 2018-06-21 19:33:57 Way to disassociate from the system: Make your own bath and body products using ingredients like coconut oil, essential oils, and herbal extracts.
1934 2018-06-21 19:33:33 I try and avoid things with labels. Kid's acne improved off sugar and soy oil.  Soy oil is nasty.
1935 2018-06-21 19:33:25 Just go with it. Slow mo. Maybe dim the lights, apply a little boiled linseed oil...
1936 2018-06-21 19:33:12 11: “guys, I swear, I didn’t say a word.  Don’t worry...I won’t rat”

Snake oil salesman: “here, drink this.”
1937 2018-06-21 19:32:56 Paula she said “do you guys not know the chemicals that cause cancer in sunscreen? I use coconut oil.” Coconut oil? So she basically just deep fried herself??!!

1940 2018-06-21 19:32:21 We have a couple horses on the oil and one on the husks. Not entirely sure if they work but the one didn't have his husks for two weeks at the horseshows and slowly lost his mind so 
1941 2018-06-21 19:31:56 bring sunscreen this time & NOT tanning oil

1943 2018-06-21 19:31:25 That colour was bloody stylish in 1995!! I’m nowhere near finished yet either, got so many unfinished doodles on my limbs, gonna be menopausal by the time he’s done. On the plus he gives me homemade cannabis oil now and I know about his sex life, so every cloud.
1944 2018-06-21 19:31:20 Olives have been a staple of Mediterranean fare for at least 5,000 years. In fact, around 98 percent of the land used to grow olive trees is in the Mediterranean region. Interestingly, more than 90 percent of the world's olive harvest is used to make olive oil.
1945 2018-06-21 19:30:43 As  OPEC watches nervously, Russia and Saudi Arabia create a new axis – of oil The next day it was announced that Russia and Saudi Arabia had agreed to “institutionalize” their two-year old bilateral arrangement to coordinate oil ...

1949 2018-06-21 19:30:25 Why don't they just say we can use cooking oil it's a lot cheaper than petrol????!!!!!! Haaahaaha just joking but seriously it's expensive
1950 2018-06-21 19:30:18 Anyone need anything from the store? I've got lots of oil as needed.
1951 2018-06-21 19:29:58 The rest of Europe are ending Toxic 2025. Another achievement for the Oil Industry and their Brexit.

1955 2018-06-21 19:29:03 I’ve actually stated using the super cheap Nivea from the tin, which is suppose to be a dupe (it can’t be... because it’s like mostly mineral oil lol)
1956 2018-06-21 19:28:48 ☼sunscreen/tanning oil (very important !!)

☼ back up clothes to change into ex. old t-shirt & some shorts
1957 2018-06-21 19:28:47 It was really good, like Disney oil pane good, however I fell asleep at the pay phone.  I didn’t think about the eggs untill the next day and unfortunately lost the Samson train of though in the mean time.
Sincerely,

1958 2018-06-21 19:28:42 I agree that for someone campaigning on the basis of establishing a meritocracy & championing economic reform, it doesn't look great. Then again, campaigning solely based on that won't "sell".
Oil being held hostage, #Tripoli's institutions being hostage... that narrative sells.
1959 2018-06-21 19:28:37 Bet he has whip marks.

1966 2018-06-21 19:27:45 Actually, the problem with America today isn’t even #trump.  It’s the surprisingly large number of dumbasses who are so easily duped by an obvious snake oil selling conman.  #Resist
1967 2018-06-21 19:27:33 Did you catch the exective order Trump signed yesterday repealing protection from oil spills in our water ways from oil drilling?
1968 2018-06-21 19:27:26 My own amateur analysis. Protect Israel and take the oil, using whoever will fight along side. With long term plan to alter the Dynamics of the whole region to make keeping the oil feasible.
1969 2018-06-21 19:27:23 It washes off really easily with water or baby oil if you used the vidcon pen. My name came off last year just from my hands accidentally rubbing it
1970 2018-06-21 19:27:18 You can change your own oil?! 
1971 2018-06-21 19:26:58 Yes!! A lot of stir fry recipients have peanuts or peanut oil in them. It’s just a cheap way to do it. Sooooo good. And it makes a really nice consistency.
1972 2018-06-21 19:26:32 Good news for oil companies: the current government doesn’t care.
1973 2018-06-21 19:26:20 The smell of castor oil . I could die . 

Thank you 
1974 2018-06-21 19:26:04 I think that's a strained comparison. The oil campaign was pure left-populism with a strong class dimension, which was a theme for the party at the time. The SNP supported UCS. Macron is fighting the unions.

1979 2018-06-21 19:24:53 No it was the CBL & not the GNA.The statement you refer to was correct but the chairman was referring to CBL & not GNA.Who judged the amount requested was over exaggerated?Due to lack of funds, NOC can't even meet its commitments to oil companies while its foreign partners are
1980 2018-06-21 19:24:51 But, but...tan suits, bare arms, MO wearing a black and white print outfit while visiting area hit by oil spill = snickers, outrage from conservatives and media/ non stop looping of video.!

1994 2018-06-21 19:23:31 So where did all Scotland's incredible oil wealth go? It certainly wasn't spent on transforming poverty, building Scottish infrastructure. I can help here - it was mismanaged, squandered to fund Tory policies and spent everywhere except here.

2000 2018-06-21 19:22:43 Committing to 2019 for Aramco IPO leaves SA weak today in their negotiations within OPEC & Russia as they have gun to their heads over maintaining $80 oil and therefore get hit with bearing higher continued slice of cuts allocation. Free from IPO means free to negotiate hard.

For growth castor oil is your best friend, @nativechild_co has. It works really well for me. Just use it to base, maybe once a week. Then use your normal moisturiser to base 2-3 times a week

So, what we do is we take the Keystone pipeline. Drain out all the oil, and turn it into a mini Hyper Loop

We then extend it to the border and just shoot the illegals right through America and into Canada

Everyone wins

2121 2018-06-21 19:09:59 People need to be aware a lot of products out there are not created equal  just because it says CBD on the Label does not mean that its an effective CBD product. a lot of CBD oil is Diluted with olive oil and just crap our hempworx products is pure Organic, Non GMO, FULL SPECTRUM
2122 2018-06-21 19:09:58 Oil lady told me I’m too smart to be broke and I can find a side hustle outside of my 9-5 to get money and invest like the white people do. It wasn’t on a spiritual level but I felt that.
2123 2018-06-21 19:09:43 $XOP $FCG still looks ok but $OIH looks like it’s barely hanging on by a thread.  That doesn’t give you any concern with oil pretty much flat?  I have a hedged position for now and have been waiting to add more long but picture shows a mixed message
2124 2018-06-21 19:09:33 Little more schwing oil and you'll be there
2125 2018-06-21 19:09:10 Dark circles:

Apply a small amount of almond oil around your eyes to treat your dark circles. Do it every night because it takes time
2126 2018-06-21 19:09:07 はい
2127 2018-06-21 19:08:49 I don't actually know anything. I just thought it would be a good idea to invest all my money in guillotine oil so that's what I did.
2128 2018-06-21 19:08:43 The immigration narrative is controlled by those who profit off human trafficking which is the biggest world wide industry, bigger than oil, bigger than drugs, more profitable than war.
Just say it out loud... It’s not immigration as much as human trafficking across borders.
2129 2018-06-21 19:08:37 Getting my oil changed finally lmfao my daddy forced me no bs
2130 2018-06-21 19:08:31 #winthetradewar get Candian  oil to tide water.
2131 2018-06-21 19:08:17 Some will criticise this move, but it seems Heineken want to break into craft beer market. Beavertown want to get their beers into more pubs. They don’t have the way in yet. Heineken will give them that clout. Expect to see Neck Oil, Gamma Ray etc in more mainstream pubs now.
2132 2018-06-21 19:08:00 Took a fish oil supplement and a cinnamon supplement.  Now my burps taste like finnamon.
2133 2018-06-21 19:07:39 How soon people forget. I dont see enough of these. Campaigns should flood media with former statements by both parties especially dems. It's always been truth that people need to hear and see.
2134 2018-06-21 19:07:38 Aramco is not USA,  it's a Saudi owned oil company. Make sure you know what you are talking about b4 you go public with it.
2135 2018-06-21 19:07:37 Growing up I always wanted a car but they don’t ever say you gotta pay for stuff like GAS, or INSURANCE, or OIL CHANGES and REPAIRS..
2136 2018-06-21 19:07:14 What up with that beard oil boss
2137 2018-06-21 19:07:11 Hear what the voice in the background is saying it was shitte DAT oil the police man
2138 2018-06-21 19:06:52 redistricting and cauing imbalance in the public educational system, the raising of tuition so minorities cannot attend higher education, starting wars, wars for oil and other resources you do not need.  NEED I GO ON.  Just like you can observe my people we show in the hell

2140 2018-06-21 19:06:46 Deffo spinach or rocket and a nice red onion, lightly fried in a chilli infused oil.....
2141 2018-06-21 19:06:41 Yes. One of my dogs takes cbd oil! He perfers the gummy (but due to sugar etc) oil works wonders for him!
2142 2018-06-21 19:06:22 We make “cheap tacos” canned shredded chicken, lettuce, onion, tomato, shredded cheese and salsa verde. Throw some white corn tortillas in a pan with some olive oil real quick, heat up the chicken and it’s good to go.
2143 2018-06-21 19:06:04 @PepsiCo's updated #palmoil policy still falls short of what’s needed to adequately address #deforestation. @pepsi should aggressively eliminate Conflict Palm Oil from its supply chain and stop doing #business with notorious bad actors.
2144 2018-06-21 19:05:47 Excuse me but the evidence is the fact that I went from not being able to get out of bed on my own&walking with a cane to feeling almost human after ingesting cannabis oil&being able to dance again. Fuck you the proof is seeing ppl like me get their life back because of cannabis
2145 2018-06-21 19:05:44 プレイするとき見せてね
2146 2018-06-21 19:05:27 I agree I saw too many people I worked with develop psychosis from cannabis use. Cannabis oil is different. It’s very healing without those side affects.
2147 2018-06-21 19:05:04 I dont care about the problems in the middle east hey. One sultan can end that conflict. All those muslims in the oil rich parts of the world can literally uplift every muslim country out of poverty, if they're serious about "their" people. 

Same for christians. But greed is #1
2148 2018-06-21 19:04:59 Makes sense, but I suspect they don't know enough about these subsidies to be outraged. The oil and gas industry has rigged the system for decades, and it's going to take a long time to unwind it all.
2149 2018-06-21 19:04:54 I got 99 problems and CBD oil has fixed at least 47 of them
2150 2018-06-21 19:04:48 Often, it’s the act of massaging the gel/oil into the effected area which has the greater effect. That gets the lactic acid moving and the increased blood flow speeds healing.

- tea tree oil

2152 2018-06-21 19:04:43 I once dated a guy who thought his masculinity rested on making sure HE changed the oil in my car. If I took it to a shop to have them change it, his dick might shatter!  barf
2153 2018-06-21 19:04:33 Like their southern cousins, Canadian Conservatives are owned by Big Oil.
2154 2018-06-21 19:04:16 The Who's Who of oil and gas money.
2155 2018-06-21 19:03:59 I just don't see it looking any worse today than it did 2 yrs ago. With that said, many seemed genuinely surprised Hall had as good a year as he did this season but I wasn't in the least. Which is where the disconnect likely is on my end.
2156 2018-06-21 19:03:49 #DanielSmith  paint company in Pacific  NW also sells  oil and watercolor pigments that are fragrant. Usually  for Christmas. Limited edition. But I always purchase.    painting pine trees that smell of pine. Wonderful

afraid of anything, save

I don't belong to anyone.

2160 2018-06-21 19:03:36 the ogx argan oil is the best
2161 2018-06-21 19:03:27 Washington Post article. Has to be true?
2162 2018-06-21 19:03:23 Hmm well pretty easy if you look at a pipeline timeline. Permian oil takeaway grows from full nowish 300kbd until epic comes online sometime in Q4 19 (heat they’re having issues getting landowners permits) and cactus 2 fully ramped by April ‘20.
2163 2018-06-21 19:03:20 Just curious, are we getting oil from Brunei?

2172 2018-06-21 19:02:07 Log Flume full of Neck Oil with their new capacity
2173 2018-06-21 19:02:06 Oh poor Derek! I hope he finds some sort of relief soon. Constant pain in unpleasant. I've been in a lot too over the last 4 weeks, it sucks. Mine is neuropathic though so painkillers don't really work. I've actually just bought some cbd oil, hoping that will
2174 2018-06-21 19:01:59 Spilled like half of my lemon essential oil on my desk and now my whole room smells like lemon pledge.
2175 2018-06-21 19:01:57 So cool! Thanks for sharing!
2176 2018-06-21 19:01:55 I hate summer. There is no cool, dry place to store my coconut oil.
2177 2018-06-21 19:01:54 @VinnieTortorich mushrooms in oil ok or moderation?
2178 2018-06-21 19:01:51 @united your hooptie-ass 1980s winabego of a plane is still sitting in this parking lot waiting for an oil change that won't fix shit. Money. Back. Now. #unitedwebreak #notunitedwestand
2179 2018-06-21 19:01:43 Whales being killed for their oil and sharks having their fins cut off and tossed back into the ocean to die are just as abhorrent. I not asking you to change your views, I just sharing my own. I personally don’t like it
2180 2018-06-21 19:01:33 I can't overstate the importance of this: The actual estimated methane leak rate from U.S. oil and gas industry is 60% higher than EPA estimates. Why this matters, and what we can do about it...(thread)
2181 2018-06-21 19:01:21 They CRUCIFIED Michelle for wearing a black and white print outfit when visiting area hit by the oil spill.  Yes Sam.  For you and yours, that warranted a 24/7 "breaking news" video loop, so stuff it!
2182 2018-06-21 19:01:21 Not by me at least. I had to go to a specialty health goods store, as it is sold as a supplement. It’s totally legal though. Not sure about UK laws for it. But if you search “cbd oil” or “hemp oil” that may give you some info.
2183 2018-06-21 19:01:20 Castor oil is supposed to help!! I haven’t tried it but I know people who have
2184 2018-06-21 19:01:20 Test your oil and gas knowledge against our mobile app. We're at the booth 248 at #DUGEast right now!

2186 2018-06-21 19:00:39 #Disney pays George Stephanopoulos $15 million year?
No wonder news media pushes their lying narrative to #AmericanPeople like they are paid to do. For that kind of $s they will sell you snake oil as the cure for cancer if told to.
Americans are the patsies
Depressing
2187 2018-06-21 19:00:35 Thank fuck that weeks over, Commercial oil and gas exams all passed. Head is fried 
2188 2018-06-21 19:00:32 Soft body skin:

Massage any body lotion + coconut oil into your skin before going to bed. You’ll wake up to moisturized and soft skin
2189 2018-06-21 19:00:30 oi does this work? (does the human race deserve everything coconut oil does for us???))
2190 2018-06-21 19:00:28 She needs to talk to someone about ad showing up on twitter promoting KM pipeline.Few days ago ad Promoting production of plastics via promoting the things oil petroleum is responsible for producing. She needs to talk to them. Clearly right hand not talking to left!
2191 2018-06-21 19:00:25 Lol this lil express by my job they ass do 10-15 min oil changes
2192 2018-06-21 19:00:25 This is a hidden subsidy for oil and gas that is non-trivial, and it desperately needs to be fixed.
2193 2018-06-21 19:00:23 ずいぶん遅くまで起きてるなー　ふにゃ…俺は眠い…(つω´)。゜
2194 2018-06-21 19:00:07 Please maintain a safe distance from the hot oil spray.
2195 2018-06-21 19:00:03 Yes, open humane world in which human life is valued, with no oil and profit-making wars. 

THIS IS ONE EARTH!

I could go into greater detail but this isn't the forum.
2196 2018-06-21 18:59:50 gotta oil up after a long day tending to your vinyards!
2197 2018-06-21 18:59:32 Awesome considering phones have a harder time in low-light/fast-moving conditions.  I just ordered a Sony a7iii specifically to get better shots in those circumstances.  There are few oil fields around where I live that I'm going to  when the camera gets in.  Anyways, rock on!
2198 2018-06-21 18:59:31 URM I WANT PICS WJEN YOU START DRAWING THINGS UP? THANKS!!!
2199 2018-06-21 18:59:30 So I must pay or charge you to visit me, aside the  t-fare?
2200 2018-06-21 18:59:24 Just cos JRM promotes a dismissive tonal style as if he knows what he’s talking about....it doesn’t mean he does.He is as much a snake oil salesman as that modern day Lord Haw Haw, Nigel Farage.
2201 2018-06-21 18:59:08 You're not supposed to put it directly; cause it's concentrated. You should mix it with coconut oil or olive oil first.
2202 2018-06-21 18:59:00 Red oil or red oyeel?
2203 2018-06-21 18:59:00 Turn them loose. American criminals on the streets, a few more won't make any difference.
2204 2018-06-21 18:58:28 Wanna get outraged? What do you think the bonding requirements are for new oil and gas drillers?  This is supposed to cover clean up costs and other risks to the public. Hint: the amount was set in the Kennedy Administration and never updated.
2205 2018-06-21 18:58:27 sounds like John Hess pessimism. Pipeline capacity should be up significantly in 2019. More capacity needed at ports (Bonds for Corpus Christi improvements were approved 2 days ago, so...) but a lot depends on whether Asian markets replace Iranian condensate with US oil
2206 2018-06-21 18:58:20 15% VAT , high unemployment, amplifying inflation and increasing oil prices . The Rand just lost 20% in 4 months what can the people do really?? Huh ?
2207 2018-06-21 18:58:05 Oil prices have gone down over the last month. Even for VPower that’s an astonishing price.
2208 2018-06-21 18:58:05 I'm not like Farage who used his ex-wife to apply for German citizenship then got rid, Rees-Mogg who said he'd leave if brexit didn’t happen, Hopkins who said the same or Lord Lawson who applied for French citizenship They’re all cowards, in it for the tax cuts and oil money.
2209 2018-06-21 18:58:02 Things I’d rather do than watch Jackie Bradley Jr. swing a bat:

1) walk through a desert naked and soaked in olive oil.

2) Electrocute my ass cheeks

3) play twister inside an active volcano

4) go skydiving without a parachute

5) eat a tide pod
2210 2018-06-21 18:58:01 lamu Floating Gas station, did they do environmental impact. How much oil and oil products are we dumping to the ocean.
2211 2018-06-21 18:57:54 It’s all men that have donated.....
2212 2018-06-21 18:57:50 Data is the new oil is the same old same old bullshit.
2213 2018-06-21 18:57:47 Totally!! CBD Oil gave my grandmother her fingers back after suffering from arthritis. Some of my students with mental disabilities(self-harmful ticks) gave my students control of their bodies back
2214 2018-06-21 18:57:16 What I don't get is the short sighted method Trump is using to solve this immigration issue.  Clearly the issue isn't a lack of border control.  People gone get over here 1 way or another.  America never know how to mind its business when its about oil and natural resources.
2215 2018-06-21 18:57:04 plus if people are looking at a $5000 deductible vs a $15 bottle of oil...they're going to want to believe the oil will worth. or at least give it a shot first, esp. if they're unaware it may end up doing more harm in the long run.
2216 2018-06-21 18:57:04 Tea tree oil really is THAT bitch
2217 2018-06-21 18:56:54 Bit of history for you you oil you bang on about had its rights sold to England and became British oil. This was done during the first few years of devolution. So what else do you have that we are stealing? We pay a premium to Scotland per head for the NHS. 1/2
2218 2018-06-21 18:56:54 Eyelash and eyebrow growth: 

Apply coconut or castor oil to your brows and lashes and leave over night for growth
2219 2018-06-21 18:56:45 The rumours still linger.  
And the slight odour of cooking oil and herbs.
2220 2018-06-21 18:56:36 A little deeper: grav as in gravitas, heavy, weighty

Olens from olēre to smell. It's related to the word for oil since you oil used to be the first choice for a base for perfume.
2221 2018-06-21 18:56:24  that is true! Also the type of coconut oil used, they’re not all the same
2222 2018-06-21 18:56:23 My scalp is SO dry and I put hella oil in it how tf ???
2223 2018-06-21 18:56:22 Yo, just ask former SC Gov Mark Sanford.

2232 2018-06-21 18:55:36 I mean u glowing but you look like u put on coconut oil. Like when u wake up and your face is greasy. I always wipe my face with coffee filters  it takes the greasyness off
2233 2018-06-21 18:55:33 That is all we need,  keep up with the Good work..
2234 2018-06-21 18:55:12 It’s also true that without Saudi Arabia’s promotion of oil nobody would use it. A truly perfect analogy.
2235 2018-06-21 18:55:08 This is good news for #democracy! The populace waits with great anticipation to see how much and which political parties have received donations from #Property #Companies, #Oil & #Petroleum Companies, #Mining Companies, #REIPPs, to name but just a few.
2236 2018-06-21 18:54:56 It really has been great. Had engine rebuild before I bought it, so had 'some' confidence. Other than that just upgraded coils, replaced a drooling and an exhaust heat shield. Serviced once a year with oil change in between. No hot start issues. Oh, and you'll only flood it once!
2237 2018-06-21 18:54:54 I need some more castor oil.
2238 2018-06-21 18:54:43 Left work at 11 bcuz i Have a training at 1pm so I decided to go get my oil changed before I go . Time well used .  nobody was in this bitch so my shit got finished quick!
2239 2018-06-21 18:54:43 Good lord, money and oil really do make people not consider the human cost of their actions. Even the animal cost has to be taken into account. Speed, the Idea that another will get the contract before you do, is to blame.
2240 2018-06-21 18:54:18 Normalize therapy. More people should talk about how important it is to seek therapy and share their experiences. Going to therapy doesnt mean there is something wrong. You get an oil change on the reg to make sure your car keeps running right. Same with mental health.
2241 2018-06-21 18:54:08 no, i promise you i completely get it. your tattoos are so beautiful!
2242 2018-06-21 18:54:07 Fish oil vitamin so big Nature Made obviously thinks I'm a whore
2243 2018-06-21 18:54:04 Venezuela's oil situation would have been fine if it wasn't for the us, juan vicente gomez, and the gulf states. And venezuela made an oil based currency, got rid of corrupt people in the pdvsa, and parts of the pdvsa tried to sabatoge venezuela under chavez.
2244 2018-06-21 18:54:00 Ah! We should compare notes sometime about our favourite gears! I like a Geneva Wheel, myself,  but historically it has to be an Archimedes Screw. But if ever in London, you want the Kew Steam Museum. A sexy temple of muscular metal and hot mineral oil. #notweirdatall
2245 2018-06-21 18:53:53 Yeah .. keep using the coconut oil hun' I trust it'll give the result ..

I've also seen people lock their hair with A LOT of wool to thicken their hair, it seemed like it helped but looked really painful .. so angaz' how you feel about that ... that's if you haven't tried it ...
2246 2018-06-21 18:53:49 Oil and fire 
2247 2018-06-21 18:53:35 I am with you. Let's remove all regulations on oil companies, building companies, energy companies. But let's not live in a world where Bezos is not regulated but Exxon Mobil is.
2248 2018-06-21 18:53:34 So many people take their families with them to get an oil change 
2249 2018-06-21 18:53:25 Saute in Garlic and Oil....
2250 2018-06-21 18:53:18 Nope. The oil companies pay.

2253 2018-06-21 18:53:09 tonight I'm doing spinach with olive oil, pepper, & a little bit of lemon and butter as a side to roast potatoes. but all of these recipes are to die for. I could make like 20 pizzas, lol

2255 2018-06-21 18:53:03 His family holds stock in oil/pipeline companies. How much did this benefit his oil holdings and future income from energy that will now have to be supplied by oil instead of solar?
2256 2018-06-21 18:52:52 LMAOOO, My mum is a scam she bought perfume oil and wants me to deliver to her in d office but don't want to pay delivery fee
2257 2018-06-21 18:52:51 You don't need a water monitor safely system. Your Ppl are that system. You've been sucked under the oil somehow. Unless that system is a quiet orderly patrol of native eyes+ears+footprints #witness #solstice  and more than meets the eye 
2258 2018-06-21 18:52:48 Went in to get my oil changed today. Walked out getting 4 new tires and out $300.  Last week spent $600 on getting a new ac compressor and some belts and the like. I better not be spending any more on this damn car this summer. 
2259 2018-06-21 18:52:48 I tried everything, but they just kept coming back. The plant was so diseased it finally colapsed and died. washing liquid, neem oil, water spray, special organic anti aphid spray, ...
2260 2018-06-21 18:52:47 Didn't they also fund his trip to Germany soon after an #NYPD officer was assassinated? @NYCMayor
2261 2018-06-21 18:52:28 My car right now feels like a metaphor for my life: It's 9 months overdue for an oil change. I can't remember when I last got it washed. There are baby wipes in the glove compartment, work receipts stashed in the door, and groceries in the trunk I haven't had time to take inside.
2262 2018-06-21 18:52:17 The State of the World (New World Order) have cancer cures but make more money on their treatment than cure. Sad. Loved ones don't have to go through this. Cannabis Oil.
2263 2018-06-21 18:52:15 These people really think we have a right to all that they oil. The USA is an empire now. The only people who haven’t clued into that are at least 60% of Americans who see the imperialism as philanthropic
2264 2018-06-21 18:52:04 Most of the oil used by USA is from USA at 40% so if gas is so expensive in Canada maybe they should build their own refineries. Total energy import value to the USA $53 billion a year, export energy value, $14 billion. That’s a huge deficit.
2265 2018-06-21 18:52:02 idk what it is abt my mouth today like mayb i dont oil it but i got this sudden violent craving for a kinder egg and i mean SAVAGE like dont even split it m8 jus cram it in my mouth jus cram the whole damn thing, plastic b fuckd

2273 2018-06-21 18:50:52 The medical cannabis oil that is needed here, is for young children who have epilepsy and get life threatening seizures. At the moment our government is in process of legalising it for them. It only has about 1% THC also has CBD. This is the imperative now.
2274 2018-06-21 18:50:43 That was what I was gonna say! Did not know that sauce trick though, what kinda sauce? (I just eat them plain and they’re real good, w/olive oil, TJ’s parm reg, and fresh pepper/salt if I feel fancy)
2275 2018-06-21 18:50:39 Koko showed us the intelligence and emotions non-humans possess.

Even so, today PepsiCo, McDonalds, and Proctor & Gamble demand's for cheap palm oil leads to mass destruction of habitat and slaughter of Orangutans.

2286 2018-06-21 18:49:39 I thought it was oil & gas companies that funded them. I also thought the NRA funded them. Either way, if you can’t see where funding is coming from, then in my mind you have something to hide
2287 2018-06-21 18:49:26 Iranian Oil Minister has exited #OPEC HQ early saying his country's concerns on raising production are not being listened to. This evening's chatter a bit of a dud #OOTT #oilandgas

2293 2018-06-21 18:48:55 .@jendalton12  is correct with her dry shampoo. It absorbs oil. Brute on a gym shirt just makes everyone nauseous.  Trust Jen. Has she ever steered you wrong?
2294 2018-06-21 18:48:55 We have attacked the ME for oil for decades, so does that they mean to attack us?
2295 2018-06-21 18:48:48 Yea, I saw I guy last week drilling 4 oil on the beach. He had his blanket right next 2 a group of college girls. #FnPerv
2296 2018-06-21 18:48:42 activity. Your tweets gingered me to commence this. Iam not seeking for any profit or recognition. So don't get how this can go wrong
2297 2018-06-21 18:48:40 Trump’s “take the oil” thing is one of the recurring moments that made me want to scream with frustration.
2298 2018-06-21 18:48:24 It’s all too common, a trader I know had someone try it on. Caught them with the bottle of oil after having added it. They paid the sticker price after a short discussion.

2305 2018-06-21 18:46:57 Well, for arguments sake, you'd have to train the people to work on the oil rigs 
BUT then we couldn't self sustain. Much in the same way we couldn't with wind & solar. Even though this one of this administration's objectives is to isolate ourselves. Let's NOT do that.

2307 2018-06-21 18:46:32 Is there an essential oil for being a 32 year old man-child?
2308 2018-06-21 18:46:18 Got my oil changed and car washed on my lunch break
2309 2018-06-21 18:46:08 Why is there always plenty oil in you people’s food?
2310 2018-06-21 18:46:00 How does someone from the MA say vegetable oil is not toxic, do they want us sick?
Look at the food pyramid, asuch grains as veggies in your diet
2311 2018-06-21 18:45:48 JT Foxx sells snake oil to desperate souls at wealth seminars. He also owns some magazines if I'm not mistaken, enabling him to get great write up about his abilities and results. Do a bit of googling and his story unravels.
2312 2018-06-21 18:45:39 So mayonnaise is made from eggs and oil; using mayo as a replacement for both of those ingredients is an old money-saving technique.

I hope that explains it.
2313 2018-06-21 18:45:23 Yeah it’s Canadian farmers fault that The Canadian government pays them better than the American government .. don’t be salty and jealous because we are paid more then you guys do .. please .. oh and do realize that Canada has lumber and oil and everything we need to survive

2336 2018-06-21 18:42:33 This looks like a fairly new car. It would have a maintenance light for an oil change. That light means low oil or low oil pressure. Pull over and check your oil dipstick. If it’s low, or not present in the dipstick. Go to an auto parts store and get the correct oil! Save $$$!
2337 2018-06-21 18:42:29 Of course the GOP believes in science - they need it to find oil and build weapons. But they know enough people will ignore their politics and learn science anyway, so they'll still be able to hire workers.

2343 2018-06-21 18:41:32 Oil changed, and got a new tire. Good start today 
2344 2018-06-21 18:41:10 I will say I don't fare as badly if my dinner contained a lot of olive oil usually. Like I browned my protein in it and roasted veggies. So there is something to that fat thing. I'm doing WW now (really do like it) and I think I need to stop worrying about points for EVOO.
2345 2018-06-21 18:41:09 We send these countries hundreds of millions of dollars every year. They send us their unemployable masses.

Your skin is shiny, or you notice a lot of excess oil on your face. You may feel like you want to wash your face again midday when oil production is at its peak. Your pores appear larger or get clogged easily, leading to black/whiteheads, pimples or cystic acne.
2363 2018-06-21 18:39:32 thank you for your words. i really appreciate it. and your tattoo is cool as heck (pinned tweet before you think i’m nuts lol)
2364 2018-06-21 18:39:30 USA is that way w/Middle Eastern oil. One of my all time fave anti Iraq war bumper stickers was, “HEY, why are they trying to steal all OUR oil?” The long and short of it right there and why USA and the west won’t get the F on up out of the ME
2365 2018-06-21 18:39:27 One of my favorite (and easy) dishes is spaghetti rigati with a sauce made of sauteing garlic, Italian seasoning, campari tomatoes and olive oil together then putting the pasta in. I always drizzle with balsamic and a hefty amount of parmesan as well

2373 2018-06-21 18:38:50 I’ve loved the theories so far. PR in Benidorm to guarding mobile nuke devices on oil rigs in the middle of nowhere! Really thought they’d be having a field day this month. Saw Moscow in Dundee 5 years ago, Europa league and they weren’t shy tbh. They’ve went up levels since.
2374 2018-06-21 18:38:50 Pretty basic but my go-to is spaghetti with olive oil, black pepper, parmesan, peas, and a soft-boiled egg.

2378 2018-06-21 18:38:31 Just listening to @HMKemiAdeosun on @channelstv now spewing gibberish in English Accent. This same woman said oil price was what "absolutely" controls the Nigeria's economy. Now she's saying it's just 10%, whereas she disproved me on this two years back.

2399 2018-06-21 18:35:51 $300 is a good starting price for oil, considering the remaining oil in the ground

2401 2018-06-21 18:35:46 You talking about baby oil and nudity makes me long for the days when I had some privacy 
2402 2018-06-21 18:35:43 Yes. They’re really similar, it’s only that combination skin has some dry parts. Those dry parts require oils high in essential fatty acids such as avocado oil.
2403 2018-06-21 18:35:40 Irani Oil has been smuggled through Iraq’s Shia militias.
2404 2018-06-21 18:35:34 (Banana + Honey)

Bananas are serious godsend for oily skin, since their gentle exfoliating properties actually remove gunk and oil from the skin’s surface without compromising your skin barrier.This two-ingredient face mask leaves skin looking noticeably glowing.

2408 2018-06-21 18:35:15 The British are very anti-Semetic and have always been.  They like the Arab OIL. Just like they continue to do business with Iran.  It all comes down to  MONEY.

2410 2018-06-21 18:35:10 Yes, come back once you run out of oil&gas. We also have salmon, oats and strawberries
2411 2018-06-21 18:35:07 Ooh. I had this a while back. Was not pleasant. Clove oil is a gift from the gods. Tastes vile if you get it on your tongue but numbs it to shittery.

You're ignoring the needs of Americans. They dont matter?
2426 2018-06-21 18:33:41 No salicylic is still the best for unclogging pores because of its lipophilic properties (means its oil soluble). Where you apply it on your face depends on what type of product you’re using. I use an SA toner all over my face and a gel to spot treat my cheeks/chin.

2434 2018-06-21 18:33:07 (Tomato)

Tomato face masks are very effective at dissolving extra oil while shrinking the size of large-looking pores. Tomato has natural astringent properties which make it perfect for this.Mash a tomato and apply on face for 15 minutes. You can apply this mask 3 times a week.

2453 2018-06-21 18:30:16 Engine oil isn’t the only thing that is seriously prone to wear and tear, the transmission fluid has this trait as well. Transmission fluid, like its engine oil brother, is prone to friction, heat, degradation and oxidation, so checks on your fluid may be beneficial.

2545 2018-06-21 18:18:43 Lmao olive oil's too spicy for the Brits.
2546 2018-06-21 18:18:39 Rationale is not every one is a Liberal cause head & understands the oil in the oceans is not the end of the world. Since modern times warships & more have slicked and the ocean itself disperses the oil.

2548 2018-06-21 18:18:27 No transit is more heavily subsidized than the private vehicle when you look at all the road infrastructure, oil industry subsidies, etc.  But then you'd never be caught dead in a "luzr-cruiser" would you Andy.

2552 2018-06-21 18:17:56 World is waiting for alternate to oil, once that happens no one will appease ME countries.
2553 2018-06-21 18:17:51 Try olive oil, fresh rosemary, red grapes and sugar sprinkled lightly over dough before baking.
2554 2018-06-21 18:17:47 Because they can make money off of it. Many in Congress would rather see out public lands used for oil and gas extraction than keeping them preserved. We need to vote for politicians who support protecting our public lands and vote out ones who don't.

2562 2018-06-21 18:16:38 Very tricky, I agree. I originally studied psychology and this was part of the ethical code where one’s own religious beliefs shouldn’t affect provision of services unless a moral argument could be justified. No one forces you to work in a service industry; that’s a choice.

2564 2018-06-21 18:16:14 What is it that the Ont Conservative party likes about oil/gas? The province doesn't produce much of it, there are no oil company headquarters here, refining and burning it puts toxins and particles into the air creating medical problems the province's taxpayers have to pay for

2577 2018-06-21 18:15:11 Typically french fries do have salt, even if she didn't put salt in them, she'd have to fry them in oil, and even if she somehow didn't, potatoes alone lack in critical nutrients necessary for a human body. You didn't know that?
2578 2018-06-21 18:15:08 I’m no scientist- but in the here and now don’t we need to worry about the harmful side effects of extraction- everything from oil spills to “proprietary” unregulated solutions used for fracking- OK earthquakes. maybe that’s better to argue- it’s more material- easier to observe

2597 2018-06-21 18:13:38 Not surprising to me. It seems that they're interested in what the hedge fund world is thinking on oil. It would be interesting to see if Central Bankers or heads of state listen too.

2679 2018-06-21 18:02:46 Gonna go with fake news until a reputable outlet has it.
2680 2018-06-21 18:02:38 Good points, but it is hard to restrict imports - if these are to support projects, and especially now as the price of oil is going up. India is a very interesting point, and that was also because of the Shareefs as they gave them favored trading status. 1
2681 2018-06-21 18:02:31 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
2682 2018-06-21 18:02:29 Folk wi an understanding of biology don't tend to be right wingers.  Ring wingers tend tae prefer oil corporations, no David Attenborough et al
2683 2018-06-21 18:02:16 I'm going to prepare a graph like that with oil prices and oil reserves.

2685 2018-06-21 18:01:47 This discussion was very interesting in that some senators were seemed fairly unconcerned with our inability to provide for US's important infrastructure..ie: electrical/oil/gas suppliers frequently w/only 1 US source. Big security risk, imho. Need to rebuild US co's & keep jobs.

2691 2018-06-21 18:01:03 Both states formed committees to negotiate the process. In late 80s oil was discovered in the south and near joint border lines. This is why both leaders rushed in. Saleh and Albeidh had closed meeting and came out with a one pager of 10 articles announcing unification.
2692 2018-06-21 18:00:52 7/ So a social decision to include transfolk would necessarily require the same steps and growth. It’s inconceivable to use race as a systematic source to deny services of any kind these days, even if some want to do it. Being gay or trans, as a state of existence, are the same.
2693 2018-06-21 18:00:38 @PhilMurphyNJ called the ExxonMobil settlement a pennies-on-the-dollar sellout to “big oil and gas interests.” He owns that now. He owes New Jersey $9 billion!

2703 2018-06-21 17:59:47 One always gets a warm, contented feeling when #oil producers assert that they’re defending consumer interests.

2705 2018-06-21 17:59:26 If only there was some pipelines, LNG/Oil terminals for all these grads to work on.
2706 2018-06-21 17:59:25 I'm for expelling all American oil interests from Canada. Let's impose sanctions as if it were North Korea commiting crimes against humanity. How can the US consistently get away with things other countries get sanctioned for? Seems like the whole system is controlled by the US.
2707 2018-06-21 17:59:07 i put lemongrass instead of lavender in my office essential oil diffuser this morning *~for a change~* and the sales ladies are NOT having it
2708 2018-06-21 17:58:55 We should stop using oil and use only clean energy. That would solve the problem.

2711 2018-06-21 17:58:39 6/ And if the company itself consists of the Muslim woman and few else (or others w/similar beliefs) then they should have to figure out a way to exist in a tolerant civil society. As JP admits, “compelling” a company to serve blacks was a societal decision for inclusion
2712 2018-06-21 17:58:35 You would love this! 4 courses and everything is local. Adriatic fish, olive oil, mushrooms, pink fizz....
2713 2018-06-21 17:58:20 Dollar so strong keeping oil prices from rising.
2714 2018-06-21 17:58:01 Lol totally worth it.
2715 2018-06-21 17:57:57 No, just no. Fig and pig, sure. Pineapple with tomato sauce is no go. Maybe if there was an olive oil base I can see it or a sweet and sour chicken/pork pizza?
2716 2018-06-21 17:57:53 @justintrudeau Responds to question about how steel tariffs against China are good due to lower labor, manufacturing and environmental standards. Sounds very hypocritical when Canada is willing to turn a blind eye towards importing oil from foreign countries with poor standards.
2717 2018-06-21 17:57:50 My dad scheduled me an oil change at the dealership at 6:45am on Saturday because “waking up early does bring blessings” jeshs fuck

2720 2018-06-21 17:57:25 @realDonaldTrump is correct! Mexico does nothing for us in helping to stem the tide of illegals entering the U.S.  The reason is $. The illegals send billions of $ back to their home countries. In fact, last year, illegal Mex sent back more $ than Mex made off of their oil

2722 2018-06-21 17:57:09 This will sound weird, but it works great. I used to have them all the time. Get natural garlic oil, put a few droppers in the ear at night and seal it up with an earplug. It almost always feel better if not good by the morning.
2723 2018-06-21 17:56:53 ME TOO. It's terrible. And I found *one* that worked - except it used mint oil, which basically set my skin on FIRE, so that was fun!

Currently using old spice classic. Seems to be working so far, although when you sniff it in the tube it smells a bit like Deet.
2724 2018-06-21 17:56:50 Coconut oil fixes everything

2732 2018-06-21 17:55:41 4/ So a Windsor waxing company can choose to fire Muslim employees who discriminate against trans women, if they wish to comply with the standards of civil society as laid out in the Human Rights Act

2750 2018-06-21 17:54:22 I'm not really a government guy either, but I'm reading Strangers in Their Own Land and hearing about how oil companies prey on weak communities and support Tea Party candidates is insane.

2758 2018-06-21 17:53:45 That's what happens when you deal with snake oil salesmen.
2759 2018-06-21 17:53:43 3/ However if the behaviour of that individual isn’t tolerated by McDonald’s (e.g., they don’t want to employ homophobes) they can easily fire them for not conforming to work rules of the company
2760 2018-06-21 17:53:43 So I got my nose piercing infected and I’ve been 
Dunking my nose into warm water and sea salt
Applying a layer of wet sea salt on the area 
And spraying it with sea salt water and tea tree oil
If anyone else knows another way hit a girl up
2761 2018-06-21 17:53:43 This oil diffuser just really made me happyyyyy
2762 2018-06-21 17:53:42 I‘m not really sure where the inconsistency is with my position. This all pretty much reinforces it. 

Also, again; someone needs to perform creative effort to extract and deliver oil, so there is the employment of labor and capital involved that deserves just reward.
2763 2018-06-21 17:53:29 But also the owner of the auto shop next to our scene shop gave me an oil change free of charge so thx Muhammad for being a ray of sunshine on my rainy day.

2767 2018-06-21 17:53:03 I cooked the shrimp low + slow in oil (garlic & crushed pepper flakes), added the rice, and then an obscene amount of shredded thai basil. I scrambled in some egg. Boom

#HalfTermGovernor
2771 2018-06-21 17:52:42 2/ Further, our conflating of people and corporations is part of the problem. Ex: McDonald’s must serve gay people food, a specific cashier isn’t required to do so if it clashes with their beliefs (though I still have trouble understanding how that could be, but that’s separate)
2772 2018-06-21 17:52:31 At this time our limited resources are best used targeting oil, which has higher climate emissions.
2773 2018-06-21 17:52:31 CIA and Mossad work in tandem with British intel.  The goal for the CIA was to replace Assad with a puppet and to topple Iran so they could access their oil.  Israel works closely with it’s “sister”, Saudi Arabia, to help this dark cause.
2774 2018-06-21 17:52:30 UHHHHHHHHHHHHHH because we deposed the rightful leader of a country because they weren't going to give their oil away to us? And because that coup we caused directly lead to the rise of the Ayatollah?
You wanna know where Iranian extremism comes from? It came from *US*.
2775 2018-06-21 17:52:24 @JustinTrudeau taking questions and when asked about Bill C-48 (Oil Tanker Moratorium Act) he reiterates his commitment to bill and says again the Great Bear Rainforest is no place for crude oil. #cndpoli

2778 2018-06-21 17:52:15 The next task for doomsayers is to explain why Peak Oil has not happened. Here are some hints. New drilling tech makes shale affordable. Renewable energy growth makes oil less important.
2779 2018-06-21 17:52:13 ....and till that let's get used to the inflated oil prices
2780 2018-06-21 17:52:12 Beauty treatments consisting of raw honey, almond oil, and rose essential oil
2781 2018-06-21 17:52:05 If you reapply regularly. I prefer an oil-based finish as opposed to a coating like polyurethane As most of the damage around here comes from hot and cold expansion and UV, not water. It’s easier to touch up oil finishes. Coatings require fully stripping and reapplying.

2785 2018-06-21 17:51:48 Love my oil. Super happy for Hall. He carried our team for years. Had little to no help and proved how valuable he was this year. Terrible trade at the time. Can’t argue it. Lars is a good player but not close to hall.
2786 2018-06-21 17:51:47 @POTUS , in regards to Mexico, why don't we end our petroleum deal with them.
They send us crap oil in exchange for our superior oil. Why? Who started this terrible trade off.

2788 2018-06-21 17:51:16 I hate oil so much 
2789 2018-06-21 17:51:15 Great idea! Maybe we should combine the Departments of Oil and Water too.

2801 2018-06-21 17:50:10 This isn’t a hard question. Compelling an individual to provide a service is an affront to personal liberty. However a business can be compelled to provide a service to all members of the community. Refusing a transgender woman waxing is on the COMPANY not the Muslim employee.

2806 2018-06-21 17:49:54 fun fact, ships, cars and electronics do more harm to the environment than oil pipelines.

not saying they don't hurt the environment I'm just saying everything you do hurts the enviornment

2955 2018-06-21 17:32:38 Not a burn. I understand what Michael was doing in the debate, but he and Peterson seemed to argue past each other, and things got more personal than anything. This allowed Peterson to pretend he was being personally attacked because his arguments were so strong, which is false.

2957 2018-06-21 17:32:08 That ran through my mind too. It seems to be a race between Mitchell and Stapleton. Bugs me that my choices subscribe to man made climate change. I'm leaning Stapleton  but question his seeming mediocre support of oil industry.
2958 2018-06-21 17:31:59 It’s still #fuckbp for that oil spill #NeverForget

2962 2018-06-21 17:31:45 About to put La Croix in my essential oil diffuser instead of regular water so I can achieve peak Edmond mom status.
2963 2018-06-21 17:31:40 Increase oil housing and car prices through regulations, give free stuff away driving the country into bankruptcy.  Send jobs overseas through taxation and regulations. More government union workers with high wages and pensions by taxing others.  Compelled speech through laws
2964 2018-06-21 17:31:30 wondering if @SenateGOP might have come thoughts or concern for older working citizens & proposed #medicare cuts of trillions? seems that @realDonaldTrump feels our money could go to some better use, #TrumpCrimeFamily @SpeakerRyan @SenMajLdr #KochBrothers #Oil & friends.
2965 2018-06-21 17:31:27 I am a victim of the oil spill, lost my business and home, was not even close to compensated due to not enough regulations.
The CEO of BP who sold most of his stock in BP 2 weeks before the expected disaster is doing just fine and what little they paid back they got to write off.
2966 2018-06-21 17:31:25 yes Ive heard it may also be milks capacity to encapsulate/emulsify oil/fat which is effective but I dunno much about that. Also, milk is usually cold which counters sensation.
2967 2018-06-21 17:31:19 From the DMS..how do we know if its fake or original?? Just viewing from a picture..
Did you drink Olive oil?

2969 2018-06-21 17:30:51 Yes and they bring you a oil closer to God cause that’s where some serious prayer happens 
2970 2018-06-21 17:30:50 Power is out in Oliver again. Obviously this is because of me and my opinions on oil. Sorry everyone. I'll get back in line and carry the Alberta torch for nonrenewable resources. My bad.  #yeg
2971 2018-06-21 17:30:43 and this oil change just did my car some justice. We back taking off on mfs
2972 2018-06-21 17:30:38 One of the most celebrated health benefits of CBD oil is its analgesic (pain relieving) effects. It’s thought that #CBD interacts with receptors in the brain and immune system to reduce inflammation and alleviate pain.

2983 2018-06-21 17:29:13 The notion that Africans are not taking responsibility for their children is ridiculous because they are will to risk their lives, be put into slavery so they have food to eat.  This is all happening because you want your diamonds and gold  and oil.
2984 2018-06-21 17:28:42 Wasn’t saying anything about Mcdavid and the Calder. Talking about the Calder winner being another botched opportunity by the oil this year. Could of had Barzal but wanted Griffin Rienhart.
2985 2018-06-21 17:28:36 Oil Kings.  More focus on them????  But in all honesty, don't have a clue what he does.
2986 2018-06-21 17:28:30 chickpeas, or some other kind of beans, sesame seeds ,olive oil, lemon juice, salt and garlic just does not sound good to me ....... if it does to you cool , go for it
2987 2018-06-21 17:28:26 Not sure about these guys running this oil change shop 
2988 2018-06-21 17:28:25 There's so much olive oil splatters on the stove top from cooking with it for the last two day.  I'm not looking forward to cleaning it.
2989 2018-06-21 17:28:23 Yes & I totally agree with you,methylated spirit is a plug..
I mixed it with E45,I've seen some small changes &oh the magnolia tissue oil from Pep too

2991 2018-06-21 17:28:18 I just got splashed by boiling oil heck
2992 2018-06-21 17:28:10 I would like some awesome oportunities to celebrate that you & Pruitt pull the tax bill rider selling oil mining rights in the Arctic Nat'l Wildlife REFUGE. Protected REFUGE. Who are you to enrich your oil co buddies and violate federal REFUGE protections?
2993 2018-06-21 17:28:00 is oil v. oil stocks discrepancy mainly contango v. backwardation?
2994 2018-06-21 17:27:58 Someone said the same about a bottle of oil and eventually collected some silver coins in anger over it.
2995 2018-06-21 17:27:54 @Ron_White crossed dry beaver creek in Arizona. I left a jar of coconut oil there. Hope it helps.
2996 2018-06-21 17:27:52 using leave in conditioner or hair oil before hot yoga makes such the difference 
2997 2018-06-21 17:27:52 ...I always find christenings unpleasant occasions. The vicar/priest always seems to act as if they own the child. Went to a Greek one a few years ago. My ex-partner was the Godmother. They put the kid naked in a font with water and tonnes of oil...

3000 2018-06-21 17:27:37 With me at all times are a tiny vile of olive oil,  a miniature lotr dwarf figurine, an old rope bracelet and €1,50.
3001 2018-06-21 17:27:28 @ITVnewsdesk can I speak to someone about something I've just seen on the news? It's about the child in Liverpool who's been stopped using cannabis oil. The bottle in the film was 100% CBD.  Therefore legal in this country. It's legal.
3002 2018-06-21 17:27:24 It’s not the *worst* Star Wars. Not even close. That’s Phantom Menace and we all know it. It’s a C grade story which is surprising given the Disney powerhouse behind it. Ignore the sexist/racist fucks, but their existence doesn’t make it a good film.

3007 2018-06-21 17:26:46 Maybe we can start building something from the abundant sand and crude oil so that in by 5050 when virtuality take over we will loan  it to Britain to remind them of what abundance we once where!!
3008 2018-06-21 17:26:40 Oh shit you were there when I brought a bottle from the same barrel snake oil.
3009 2018-06-21 17:26:38 I’m assuming America’s new plan to prepare for asteroid impacts involves retraining oil rig workers?

3013 2018-06-21 17:26:12 Haliburton worked in Algeria too with oil contracts.
3014 2018-06-21 17:25:55 in CT the only utility assistance availability seems to be heating oil unfortunately. looked into what services are available here. gonna apply for SNAP but our food costs are already next to nil since we go to food trucks
3015 2018-06-21 17:25:52 Eno - have you ever tried Lavender Essential Oil? Im a pretty high strung guy that works a stressful job and have this same issue...the essential oil totally helps chill me out before bed time so I can actually rest my mind & body...give it a try!

3023 2018-06-21 17:25:02 Jishnu Das asks @JaimeSaavedra22 about the proliferation of snake oil consultants/advisers offering Ministers “advice” - he talks about how critical his informed team in Peru was, with capacity to consume advice

 solving this in other countries would be big step forward
3024 2018-06-21 17:25:00 Not sure what time OPEC announces, but you'll see oil moving before the news breaks.
3025 2018-06-21 17:24:50 No.  I'm not a war mongering maniac that goes halfway around the world to murder innocent brown ppl who didn't have it coming all in the name of hegemony and oil.

3027 2018-06-21 17:24:35 Is that also true for Amazon, Facebook, Google, Twitter, Netflix and the myriad of very wealthy USA corporations, or is your communist agenda specific only to the oil & gas industry?

3029 2018-06-21 17:24:27 Maybe I put my optimist hat on and say that Lucic thought that offering himself up as playoff run trade bait was a way to help himself & the Oil from a contract point of view, that guilt negatively impacted his game, that he recognizes that and aims to come back better than ever.
3030 2018-06-21 17:24:19 Oil rallying. Oil stocks not so much

3034 2018-06-21 17:24:10 Human Decency Story of the Day: One patient noticed a leak on another patients car in our clinic parking lot. They notified management and left a carton of oil for them to use when they got out of their appt. Everyone teared up a bit. #lookforthehelpers

3037 2018-06-21 17:23:54 We should shut down the oil refinery. It's poisoning the most vulnerable Philadelphians.

3047 2018-06-21 17:23:11 Sadly my nostalgic glimpses of the Total Mediterranean Lifestyle, as against staying in Stoke but upping the olive oil dose on your chips, are not even as anchored in a genuine memory as Mr Manager's heartbreaking ones are.
3048 2018-06-21 17:23:11 Forgive my naivety but surely any analysis should always be bespoke to the client? Those that ive worked with (oil / mining / utilities/ investment) are always adapted to the needs of a specific actor on the stage. Do firms really buy "off the shelf" rehash of CIA world factbook?
3049 2018-06-21 17:22:55 Very proud to announce that I’m officially tan again. I’d like to thank first and foremost the sun, my friends and family for supporting me through this journey, and my faithful carrot tanning oil. You have no idea how much this means to me

3051 2018-06-21 17:22:42 Crude oil prices have fallen. But you have done nothing yet to bring down petrol/diesel prices. Most inefficient minister, ever.

3072 2018-06-21 17:19:15 Absolutely ridiculous stopping a poor lad taking cannabis oil for medical reasons reducing the number of seizures he is having and for pain too. It’s not like it’s recreational. Absolutely vile. Poor little soldier. Anything to help anyone should be given.

3081 2018-06-21 17:18:33 Barack was a classy, educated, and dignified man. He didn’t speak like a vile, hateful, racist! That’s the point! If you bought into the only things trump was selling (hatred, racism, and snake oil) that’s on your sorry ass. There is NO COMPARISON between the two.

3094 2018-06-21 17:16:31 We’re getting robbed by the oil companies. Did Trump include Canadian sales of oil at rock bottom prices in his trade deficit tant? Why are we not refining?
3095 2018-06-21 17:16:24 @VidCon could use some oil on the door in 255 in the new building. Watching the Collab preso, but keep looking behind me to see if Dracula is climbing out of his coffin. #ScaryDoor

3099 2018-06-21 17:16:03 We'd be moaning about what Senator Jeff Sessions from Alabama said on the floor of the Senate and glad that he didn't have any unilateral power to screw up lives. Oklahomans would still be complaining about Scott Pruitt and how sleazy he is and a shill for big oil.
3100 2018-06-21 17:15:51 @megsaystweet You were looking for some eczema help.  Try some coconut oil if you have any about.  Doesn't work for everyone but worth a go.

3104 2018-06-21 17:15:38 I am told by an ex Venezuelan collegue that people are fleeing Venezuela to survive. The hospitals are totally out of medicine. Lots are fleeing to Colombia, which is already struggling themselves. Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world, but the system failed.

3109 2018-06-21 17:15:09 But, there's engine oil seeping through the vaccuum lines into the air filter box now. Taking vacation so I can get a rental and drop it off. Shitty part about traveling for work.

3111 2018-06-21 17:14:58 Safe and healthy oils/fats to cook with often solidify when put in the fridge or at a cool room temperature. Butter, ghee, lard, coconut oil and even quality EV olive oil will solidify in the fridge.

3123 2018-06-21 17:14:12 I'm really not trying to tell you what to believe or anything tho- I honestly just believe the church and being queer are like oil and water and I honestly want to understand how believing otherwise is working at all for you. You do you when it comes to religious beliefs.
3124 2018-06-21 17:13:55 You worried about a wall.

Ofc, bread and butter is popular, but you can also use olive oil instead of butter. But okay, everyone got your point mister. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

3144 2018-06-21 17:12:27 They do if you're selling vegetable oil
3145 2018-06-21 17:12:26 Why are we not refining oil here  in Canada. Oil sands product is shipped to Texas for refining. They closed the refineries in Halifax. Why weren’t they modernized to refine Canadian oil? Seriously questioning motives.
3146 2018-06-21 17:12:26 I remember the oil was over the pan when I took it out of the oven but then it soaked back into the base. 
Personally for me and my kids it was divine 
3147 2018-06-21 17:12:23 I just sautéed a bunch of onions, beat 5 eggs with some butter and olive oil, and then a bit of milk and cheese in a nonstick. I let it sear off covered, and then baked whole skillet at 450 for 10-15 mins. I turned it out and let it cool. Put on pizza stone w sauce/cheese. 10 min

3151 2018-06-21 17:12:09 ensure the economy operates at equilibrium.." In the process industries, with today's tools and instrumentation, operating very COMPLEX processes  (more so than oil prod.) at equilibrium is normal. One caveat: no room for politics in stoichiometry.

3158 2018-06-21 17:11:25 coconut oil in my bedroom is so good, I just opened the door and was startled to hear the washer is moved
3159 2018-06-21 17:11:16 Nah I'll disagree there. Costs are falling. It's a transition that's taken place in the past. Biomass to coal (for heat) in 1800s, coal to oil (for transport) in 1900s. It's real and happening. Doesn't mean there won't be bankruptcies, however.

3236 2018-06-21 17:05:50 When I think, opposites — 

I think OIL and WATER, because they don’t mix. 

But the key is to not make them mix, 
but figure out how they can balance one another.

3248 2018-06-21 17:04:29 Where water washes flow freely, and work on a gravity principle, oils act as more of a suspension, and stay where you put them. But also due to oil’s nature, they take a while to dry. As in, wash, go to bed, go to work the next day kind of wait for safety’s sake.

3306 2018-06-21 16:57:52 On those points I generally agree with you. Re the oil contracts, I suspect there's more to it behind the scenes that we are aware of. Nonetheless, the whole thing doesn't bother me much. As long as I think the contracts process remains relatively respected.

3313 2018-06-21 16:57:08 During 19th century I'd invested in a crude oil producing company but not in an operator/producer of petrol stations (the first commercial petrol stations were put into operation in the beginning of the 20th century only). Always remember about "opportunity costs".

3366 2018-06-21 16:50:07 honestly using rosehip seed oil every night before I go to sleep has made my face so much more brighter and softer
3367 2018-06-21 16:50:05 How much for a high mileage oil change?
3368 2018-06-21 16:49:51 Yang kerja bukan background oil and gas ni yg lebih-lebih. How Ironic..
3369 2018-06-21 16:49:51 Happy Birthday to BB. From defending Mullah Omar to opening Taliban office, her services to islamisation of Pak,the bases for Western Feminism, only matched by either her father or Ziaul-Haq.
Obsession with BB can only b defined by a Sindhi Haari’s explanation ‘Bhutto ji Niyarhi’
3370 2018-06-21 16:49:31 Dude, Iran was doing pretty goddamn well until the US decided to destabilize them because we wanted their oil.
3371 2018-06-21 16:49:24 But beware! Data is oil. Unrefined, it's useless and possibly dangerous. It costs a lot to maintain and store. It has side effects. It even contributes to climate change via energy usage. Only refined is data powerful.

3373 2018-06-21 16:49:09 So.  It is a small cost to pay to stop climate change.  Unlike you, I believe in climate change (like 97% of the world’s climate scientists) and not the shills from the Oil industry that you believe in.

3379 2018-06-21 16:48:32 Do you want me to get you an essential oil diffuser?
3380 2018-06-21 16:48:29 All good points but might attract  a Japanese or American airline looking for more Heathrow landing slots for long haul if they ran the odd commuter jet to and from Edinburgh & Aberdeen for golfers & oil company workers.
3381 2018-06-21 16:48:27 Important to note here that if OPEC decides to add production, it is likely to affect Brent prices more than West Texas/U.S oil prices. Brent down $1.04 a barrel so far today as we await word out of Vienna. OPEC meeting tomorrow to discuss adding production.

3386 2018-06-21 16:47:53 realize healthy fats like olive oil have a place in diet. But i like nonfat milk.

3388 2018-06-21 16:47:20 Sustainable cropping of forests for is fine. Nor do I object to willing sellers and willing buyers. 

If your goal is to lower CO2 generation, then burning wood is insane. Wood has more carbon atoms per hydrogen atoms (hydrogen has the energy) than coal, oil, or nat gas.

3390 2018-06-21 16:46:59 Similarly, "Nutrition Facts" track saturated and trans fat, incorrectly suggesting they are similarly unhealthful, but make no mention of polyunsaturated fats, though oxidized polys from seed oil are perhaps the worst single component of the American diet.
3391 2018-06-21 16:46:43 Maybe I did it wrong but this pasta sauce I made isn't nearly as spicy as advertised. Even though I used dried ancho chilies for it.

Next time I'll just mortar the tried chili with oil and make a paste out of it.
3392 2018-06-21 16:46:30 When you submerge yourself in coconut oil after a shower. Yes lawd.

3397 2018-06-21 16:46:15 Also, a large percentage of Americans do not vote. Is voting so unAmerican that only non-citizens are interested in doing it? This seems as crazy as people saying Bush only wanted oil when invading Iraq.

After OPEC meeting, what is expected? do you think a production increase is already priced in and 62~63 support & higher prices? or more deeper sell?
3475 2018-06-21 16:36:33 Pro tip: if you're going to tip your bike over on yourself while checking the oil, do it BEFORE you fill it with gas. Damn it's heavy.

3491 2018-06-21 16:34:50 From the videos, one or two indoor units connected to a single outdoor unit should be able to cover/cool your whole home. They can also supplement your baseboard heating to reduce oil costs.
3492 2018-06-21 16:34:29 1) Were they not at 48?
2) Maybe Gryba thought he had a chance to make a difference on another team? Obviously wasn’t gonna play with the Oil this year....
3) Allows for more devlopement for the AHL players. This is one thing I think the oilers need to do more of.

3494 2018-06-21 16:33:39 You mean the public wilderness and public land you want to give away or sell for pennies to your pals? Or open to roads, vehicles, oil wells and pointless brutal hunting? That’s really what you mean by “awesome opportunities” and we all know it. Resign, shabby little man.

3499 2018-06-21 16:32:38 Uses a purposeful 1.5% growth indicating a 0.5% gdp spend, (not austerity), the 1.5% figure in sgc is also purposely reduced from 2.5% to make it a worst case scenario, which also for sake of info, doesn’t include oil, and based entirely on a GERS starting point...
3500 2018-06-21 16:32:27 Will soon. My car is at the dealership getting oil change/maintenance. They dropped me here, as usual.
3501 2018-06-21 16:32:16 Ah! Perfectly explainable because they ran concurrent. Venezuela chose to take on a lot of debt during the fruitful years and collapsed during a oil market down turn.

3533 2018-06-21 16:28:29 This recipe calls for an entire bulb of garlic to be roasted with olive oil and seasonings.

I'm making *slightly* less than the recipe dictates (a smaller glass dish) so won't quite use the full head. Plus, I don't have foil or a garlic press, so will sauté the garlic instead.

3559 2018-06-21 16:26:03 This is nice but the Pres should accompany her instead of hiding in the Oval Office. Obama went to the Gulf States during the BP oil drill disaster, Bush made an attempt to go to NOLA after Katrina...Trump should be on the front line of this.

3638 2018-06-21 16:16:07 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
3639 2018-06-21 16:16:03 Oil change and car wash today..
3640 2018-06-21 16:16:02 I thought youse had huge oil fields and shit up in Alberta?
3641 2018-06-21 16:16:00 nothing like boiling oil hitting your skin to wake you up in the morning amirite
3642 2018-06-21 16:15:52 Be sane when you are in a relationship. If you are not going to get married, go your separate ways with reasons,without fight and maturedly.
My Ex. found me a buyer for 10 drums of red oil from the North. God bless you  and your family Tabitha.
3643 2018-06-21 16:15:48 Does #msmn ring a bell - a jar full of “sweet oil” did wonders a familiar story I suspect
3644 2018-06-21 16:15:46 Combine 9 tsps bluefish with 11 lbs cupcakes. Mix in Olive Oil. Set aside for 3 days Serve with chili
3645 2018-06-21 16:15:43 してましたねぇｗ づほかわいいっすから
3646 2018-06-21 16:15:40 Check your Engine oil this morning.
3647 2018-06-21 16:15:38 I have seen this with ibidi dishes. If you leave oil at the bottom for extended times and not clean them they crack.
3648 2018-06-21 16:15:32 everyone has told me castor oil but i refuse  that’s disgusting tbh
3649 2018-06-21 16:15:29 Oh dear, palm oil is one of the main ingredients in Nutella!!
3650 2018-06-21 16:15:21 Peppermint oil?
3651 2018-06-21 16:15:08 Olive Oil Icecream?
3652 2018-06-21 16:14:55 This extraction of avocado oil is taking way too long. Why did i choose this method again?!
3653 2018-06-21 16:14:55 Sad this province had so many possibilities like ore, oil and recycle but yet we would rather ship it off some place else than refine it ourselves and reep the full rewards.
3654 2018-06-21 16:14:45 Our office is littered with essential oil diffusers. Someone put too much peppermint oil in all of them this morning. My eyes are burning. I’m in a toothpaste-smelling Hell. There’s no escaping the minty-freshness that surrounds us all.
3655 2018-06-21 16:14:32 I'll try coconut oil and aloes.
Dousing it won't work well for me with the dreads. Take FIVEever to dry.
3656 2018-06-21 16:14:26 100% of our palm oil is sourced from responsible and sustainable sources, but we will be sure to let our team know that you would like to see our products without palm oil in them
3657 2018-06-21 16:14:22 Grand maa’s secret hair oil?
3658 2018-06-21 16:14:05 Saudi got oil from the ground .  Therefore they are important.  Ask this mullah if we can drill oil out of his rear.
3659 2018-06-21 16:13:53 I'll butt in & say don't even try it. I tried several things & nothing worked back when I was pregnant a long time ago. I ended up being induced by the Dr. at 41 1/2 wks. Don't let anyone tell you to drink castor oil. 
3660 2018-06-21 16:13:47 My eyelashes need castor oil and God.
3661 2018-06-21 16:13:32 Home oil users.. Boiler Juice now add £2.99 to every order so the price per liter you see is NOT the price per liter you pay. Rather naughty in my humble opinion! It's all in grey ink too.
3662 2018-06-21 16:13:25 So I can tell by that last comment you have no idea what you are taking about when it comes to onshore oil workovers….

A bit embarrassing. If you want help than I am here for advice – do you even know the reason for decreasing bore diameter? Or anything oil related? #NUOG
3663 2018-06-21 16:13:24 Can you ever really go in for “just” an oil change?  #goodbyelifesavings #roadtrip #plnretreat
3664 2018-06-21 16:13:10 Here is a scenario I like IF the Oil want to go with Smith.  Trade down a few spots & get isles/stars/flyers 2nd rounder in return.  Oil then use their 2 2nd round early 40s picks to trade with someone in the high 20s to take a chance on Merkley.  What u think?
3665 2018-06-21 16:13:02 Plastic comes from oil. Childrens's toys are made from plastic. Are you against children having toys? #ClimateChange #GlobalWarming

3674 2018-06-21 16:11:57 Those attributes are called personality. The latter is a force multiplier. I don’t make those rules.
3675 2018-06-21 16:11:56 Tim-- The Oil Industry is in Great Fear Today because of TRUMPS Tariffs because of the Disruption it will cause in the Supply Chain Line & Compromise ALL Energy projects and production. Now Tell me Again how he Has No Influence in the Oil Industry..
3676 2018-06-21 16:11:53 He doesn't want people from the middle east but he wants their oil, looters are nasty you know.
3677 2018-06-21 16:11:43 Trump will always display the spirit of the fool. The courage of discipline is measured by a willingness to do the right thig & surrender parts of ego. Trumps chaotic political humiliation & his continuing defective performances prove a short fuse & a childish snake oil salesman.

3680 2018-06-21 16:11:17 Fact – Burning coal, natural gas, or oil produces CO2. Fact – CO2 is a green house gas and warms the atmosphere. Fact – Warmer air holds more moisture. Fact – Rain is moisture and too much causes severe damage to your property.  Our Government denies this.  Vote smarter...

3683 2018-06-21 16:11:09 Of course its dirty. The q is why 1 person who has declared a coup d’etat & has been the most violent man in Libya for past 4yrs, & also attacked oil installations when they were working previously, is not a terrorist but Jadran is. Also why was Jadran not previously a terrorist.
3684 2018-06-21 16:11:05 Yeah dead ass like olive oil LMAO

3788 2018-06-21 16:00:58 I find it so stupid. Why argue about miri/bintulu deserves LRT more than Kuching just because miri/bintulu has oil/gas? Go and get some education first before you bring up a bloody topic like that.
3789 2018-06-21 16:00:55 Nooooo!! You can’t! Have you tried peppermint oil? I LOVE it for headaches!

3792 2018-06-21 16:00:36 I had the most random dream that I was watching @joss_mooney and @Rogan_OConnor wrestling in oil right in front of me... it’s random because like?? 
3793 2018-06-21 16:00:36 The West have created there own bogey monster by interfering in Middle East in the pursuit of oil. According to my finding Europe was once a pagan safe haven but that changed when Christian Kings used the sword. Does that mean all Christians are wrong? The answer is no.

3795 2018-06-21 16:00:25 I'm big into oil. I own lots of it and I know what it smells like. It's rich smelling. The smell itself spawns property and mansions.
3796 2018-06-21 16:00:22 Yes I have been getting on with it really well - I use the boob tube, stretch mark oil and tummy butter every day and then the lucky legs when I’m achey & tired x

3812 2018-06-21 15:58:56 do you massage your scalp often? it promotes hair growth. or try hemp oil!!
3813 2018-06-21 15:58:54 Thanks for reading. I made sure not to use that phrase; I just said it burns more cleanly than coal and oil, which it does, though the ecological costs of extraction are enormous.
3814 2018-06-21 15:58:53 So, we made $20 today towards the Evo trip thanks to S3xyHippo, very generous of them. Pretty happy with that start, just need to get a rich Arab oil prince in stream now who'll drop $10k on me. Will hopefully be back tomorrow with gross top tier action!

Clearly McDavid wasn’t quite valuable enough to will his team to more success from the bench. No #HartTrophy.

3839 2018-06-21 15:56:26 The intention is to maintain a healthy level of supply buffer, as consumption increase, a bigger buffer (storage) is needed. Price of oil does affect, but it is not the only factor.

3846 2018-06-21 15:55:56 I have a shirt like that in the trunk of my car. I use it to check the oil #dustrag
3847 2018-06-21 15:55:52 Yea, but you won't like it!!
Start with cutting out ALL processed food and beverages.
Only take FREEZING showers (addresses systemic inflammatory markers). Get at least 8 hours of sleep every night. 
Take fish oil, and turmeric every day  :)
Give it 14 days.
3848 2018-06-21 15:55:42 Yeah, it's a bit unfair, but this has been the "game" for millennia now and will continue despite the protestations of those who claim there is no "gender".  At least, until the fire rises...
3849 2018-06-21 15:55:40 Does this guy sell snake oil also   What a joke this guy is
3850 2018-06-21 15:55:40 Ha ha ha, I shouldn't like this, but my school has just gone balls deep into the snake oil that is PIXL.
3851 2018-06-21 15:55:28 oil change is needed for your engine.
3852 2018-06-21 15:55:28 Will, it's the firearms.  Don't let them use the muscles or money as an excuse.  They like the firearms.

3854 2018-06-21 15:55:26 Because people bought more into the lies and fearmongering of the no campaign. Especially in regard to EU citizenship, supposed lack of oil in the North Sea, and the lie about no more pensions and benefits in an independent Scotland.
3855 2018-06-21 15:55:23 Advanced economy? All economies have advanced. You can not skew the variables and controls to justify your assertion. Are tribes deep in the Amazon or west African jungles unsuccessful because they don’t trade hi-tech bombs to rich oil countries?
3856 2018-06-21 15:55:22 #slomins oil worst customer service. Can anyone recommend a local oil company that is good.
3857 2018-06-21 15:55:21 They used to boil penguins to make lamp oil.

3860 2018-06-21 15:55:08 Many of your and @realDonaldTrump's followers love the snake oil and Kool-aide you provide them. I'm surprised Fox doesn't have something more immediate to cover--like the children ripped from their parents' arms.

3862 2018-06-21 15:55:03 I don’t fuck w oil base paint
3863 2018-06-21 15:54:58 You’re not completely correct either as the flight of capital has been away from all oil and gas activity, not just oil sands greenfield. As well, the high cost has always been there and yet the capital flowed in.  This isn’t about cost, it’s about price and uncertainty.
3864 2018-06-21 15:54:55 I get phantom pains and still have trouble with greasy food cooked in vegetable oil. Surprisingly I’ve found butter/animal fat is fine, along with avocados. I do take a pill (Colestid) daily that helps absorb extra bile and avoid dumping syndrome.

3877 2018-06-21 15:53:48 Trade is an international action in today’s world and commerce is seen as internal. While both terms can be used to describe each other.  Is does not change the fact that the oil industry is not a state own and operated asset and therefore is not controlled by the president

3894 2018-06-21 15:52:06 That was 50+yrs ago. The world has changed since then, US needs the cheap fabric of Bangladesh, middle eastern/African Crude Oil, cheap Chinese electronics and co. D world needs ur Agric produce, technology and weapons and co. D goal is borderless and tariff-free world.

3898 2018-06-21 15:51:43 I have to disagree. There are millions invested in our schools/paid in taxes that stay here. People now have jobs and they live here so that money stays here. People receive oil checks for wells that haven’t received anything in years. That money sure helps during a drought.
3899 2018-06-21 15:51:40 Gue gapernah cocok dah sama complexion produk korea, terlalu putih semua gue jarang sih makenya, tapi enak banget paginya muka gue kenyel gitu. Masuknya kaya face oil biasa. Gue pengen beli tarte shape tape tapi katanya sama aja kaya colourpop ato ga MUR. Alig tajir
3900 2018-06-21 15:51:35 Yelling. Does not prove your point.  The oil trade is not now nor it ever been controlled by the us governement.  The only action the president can take is to release oil reserves that the government purchases on the open market to effect the supply side of the equation

Assuming that Teslas are maximally efficient (because, if efficiency is being held back by evil oil companies, why wouldn't they be), this puts the theoretical maximum efficiency of combustion engines at ~70 MPG

3939 2018-06-21 15:47:30 There is something called TECHNOLOGY that we have not used to the fullest. Plastic to fuel, oil and other converted byproduct is possible. Then why were we waiting for the world's largest polluters to help. They will dump but we can find the way out. Let's do that

3944 2018-06-21 15:46:54 Pruitt was a horrible OK AG, but there he only looked greedy- having a bunch of private, for-pay oil clients while on the public payroll.

3952 2018-06-21 15:46:15 First, as mentioned in the linked tweet, during the much-lauded era of $100 oil the CAD was about par with USD. There's no inflationary spin.

4125 2018-06-21 15:28:10 Some Statutory transfers Some statutory transfers are tied to the volume of the CRF and any increase in the benchmark price of crude oil (as happened in the 2018 budget) will automatically increase them.

4127 2018-06-21 15:27:56  I’m totally onboard with the issues with plastic. Completely. But it seems a bit strange to eat the sea life at the same time. Like I’m against palm oil for what it does to the orangutans - so I’m not about to eat the orangutans! Not to mention the issue with...

4156 2018-06-21 15:24:38 Oh yeah.  Maybe too keep oil prices low to prevent OPEC from investing in infrastructure, a reverse narrative from 2016 to keep prices around $50 so #shale wouldn't explode as $60 is far too lucrative for US producers

4195 2018-06-21 15:19:58 Exactly:Dog chasing tail. BE is not static but dynamic as service cost increases on the rise of oil price. It is purely a marketing tactic to attract capital from investors which I pay little attention, what is more important is how long AND SUSTAINABLE WTI can stay above $65.

4212 2018-06-21 15:17:52 In the long run, though. In the short run the squeaky wheel tends to get the oil.

4218 2018-06-21 15:17:28 But cut Medicaid, Medicare, open our waters for oil drilling, and continue locking people in concentration camps. 

Yeah, nice work.

4221 2018-06-21 15:17:16 And how can they even reduce deficit when they’re not the ones that will generate the money because they increased the total budget cost which most likely means they reviewed revenue projections or increased oil benchmark to make way for more money, something we can’t bank on..
4222 2018-06-21 15:17:08 Silly. Weak. Tax scam. Corporations tax reduction is evergreen and moved from 35 percent to 15 percent,leaving loopholes to reduce even lower. American people crumbs & postcard size filing w/expiring tax break. Tarrifs will now factor in on goods w higher inflation and oil/.
4223 2018-06-21 15:16:54 We have already been over this. Find a legitimate talking point. Oil and Gas is good for New Mexico. The Permian Basin  is one of the most lucrative oil fields in the world. That brings money into NM.

4266 2018-06-21 15:12:32 Of course this is all assuming oil prices keep a level to incentivize oil producers to give away their associated gas.  If oil prices drop enough (sub $35 ??) then maybe Permian issues will be solved right then.  Just my two cents.

4286 2018-06-21 15:10:59 I'm definitely not a fan of deep pans of oil on the stove. Mind you, I don't have a great relationship with deep fat fryers, after I stuck my hand in the one at work (instead of the bucket of soapy water next to it) Thought it was a bit hot. Atleast batter is an insulator.

All the glaciers in Arctic Ocean melting creates a shorter trade route along top of Canada and allows for more oil drilling. $$$$

4316 2018-06-21 15:07:36 I really love this product. It's a really rich so a little goes a long way. I mainly use mine in the evening before going to bed, so that way I can wake up with glowing skin. (I always add a little bit of oil in my eyebrow gel when it dries up).
4317 2018-06-21 15:07:32 Unfortunately I think a big part of what allowed WW2 to happen was our 'stay out of it' desires after WW1. And even before WW1.

There's always been a strong isolationist trend to the people in the US. Except when we want their stuff (Oil, land, bird shit).

4334 2018-06-21 15:06:33 We recently spoke to another Twitter user on how she's spent 20 years living with RA (now in her 50's) & the only thing to have ever eased her pain completely is cannabis oil. Have you ever tried this? What do you think about making CBD oil legal in the UK for medicinal purposes?
4335 2018-06-21 15:06:31 Getting a oil change
4336 2018-06-21 15:06:27 You'd need to use an oil drum to boil that one. Big bug!
4337 2018-06-21 15:06:09 Yes they do ,  even when the $ dropped prices  still rose and are rising. Oil has been in production for a while but no relief , economically on the ground. Some, its seems, are controlling the situation and benefiting hugely from the chaos.
4338 2018-06-21 15:06:01 Or maybe hanging her upside-down over a vat of boiling oil in a cave, or something. 
4339 2018-06-21 15:05:34 Not been shopping. No fruit or veg in the house at all. Just googled "Is Olive oil one of your 5 a day"... it isnt.

4342 2018-06-21 15:05:16 It’s all a show. This attracts people who don’t want to think or read or learn. This is for people dazzled by a celebrity, a spectacle, loud, macho, abrasive. They don’t care about policy or how it affects their lives. We don’t want a showman/snake oil salesman. We want a leader.

Water is the lightest food item to digest.
Oil floats on water, hence oil is lighter than water.

4362 2018-06-21 15:02:31 Ice should be melting though, but yeah, stay off our oil reserves mate
4363 2018-06-21 15:02:28 First, that's the price of Brent Oil, not WTI. Canada is primarily on WTI. WTI is trading at $~65.

Second, NO ONE USES CAD TO GAUGE OIL PRICES. Commodity markets are always in USD. The CAD is at 0.75, so you inflated the price of the wrong oil 33% to spin this.

4368 2018-06-21 15:02:15 Source @wsj "Oil prices firmed on Wednesday, supported by declining U.S. oil inventories, a rebel attack in Libya and expectations that international oil producers meeting this week may decide to boost production, but moderately.

1. inflation to increase
2. interest rates to increase
3. loss of jobs

Could the oil not fade the 10 for 4, pick the player Ottawa wants, flip him to Ottawa for Karlsson. Ottawa then gives Colorado the 10th. Edm flips Karlsson to Vegas for Theodore Etc?

-2 oils
-1 oil x long lasting body spray

then i moisturize with rose water and vegetable glycerin

4470 2018-06-21 14:50:16 I hate sanding, but that moment when you first apply an oil finish is nothing short of magical.  Congrats on a beautiful job! #woodworking

4472 2018-06-21 14:50:14 Sauce is easy! A lot of sauces are already vegan. One of my faves for pasta is the wegmans tomato basil. And for meat alternatives I just eat a lot of tofu, fried in a pan with olive oil & soy sauce. Sometimes I’ll add mushrooms and broccoli and make a sandwich, or add to pasta
4473 2018-06-21 14:50:13 Let the record reflect that Saudi Arabia and Russia are about to raise output 600K-800K per day in an oil market that needs 1M+ barrels per day and WTI crude dipped to $65.75.
4474 2018-06-21 14:50:12 You are right but Sadly oil is priced in $ not €.

4490 2018-06-21 14:49:05 You mentioned nationalizing industries like that was the solution to mass surveillance.  That would centralize surveillance under the Government.  But keep selling snake oil if that works for you.
4491 2018-06-21 14:48:46 well yes obviously this is not the case for all parents but for ppl that have a lot i think they’re about as likely to notice it as they are to notice like a bottle of olive oil missing from the pantry. unless they take inventory or something

4501 2018-06-21 14:47:58 afterwards. Shifting back and forth between preparations douced Eddie in perspiration... grease.. and a bit of cooking oil.

4506 2018-06-21 14:47:09 Mr. Trudeau is on record saying he wants to phase out oil.

There is a lot of gas and crude oil in the market. Prices must go down.

So yes, maybe they should have to pay a premium to help developing nations get to parity.
As far as international trade goes, I think oil rich countries should definitely pay/do more.

4541 2018-06-21 14:43:01 u r kind of right, but atleast in india, we have periods of relative stagnation and the biggest battle for India is Currency depreciation and Current account deficit which is affected by Oil Prices. We just can not grow like china, but we do better with lower oil prices.

Points to benefit of CCIR policy vs SGER. Under SGER this lowering of the project’s avg emission intensity would *reduce their baseline* for free allocations. Perverse disincentive.

4550 2018-06-21 14:41:49 It’s short sighted to think we aren’t globally invested and involved at this point. Especially because we stick our military noses in everyone’s business. Mainly countries with oil. It’s a global world now. Economically, politically. Packing up your toys to go home doesn’t work.
4551 2018-06-21 14:41:40 What is with every Oklahoma politician, if they’re not fleecing us (Pruitt), they’re selling out their costituents to the oil lobby (Lankford, Inhofe). Any doubt about their accumulated wealth and post retirement perks?

4753 2018-06-21 14:19:21 What the hell is wrong with this world !!  How can cannabis oil be legal for some people with fits but not to help cancer patients !!! We are all different people with problem’s that also need help!!!!  
4754 2018-06-21 14:19:20 Very productive. I have a pile of work on today. I’d like to say burning the midnight oil today but it’s the longest day and there’s still some light in the sky at midnight. #deadlines #videotranscription

4757 2018-06-21 14:19:09 Which the press will run with as an example of how Trump is attacking the sacred press, and call themselves martyrs for truth, and hug each other and give themselves awards...
4758 2018-06-21 14:19:09 (Just to butt in) i have sensitive dry skin & the oil is really soothing and helps with smoothing out your texture if it's on the rougher side. my redness was gone within 3 weeks of using it
4759 2018-06-21 14:19:00 "What you in for?"
"Armed robbery and murder. You?" 
"Olive oil fraud."
4760 2018-06-21 14:18:54 A funnel can be used when pouring water,  palm oil,  coconut oils and other liquids

4765 2018-06-21 14:18:38 Considering the Ruble is in worse shape than the dollar, nothing.

Allowing Russia to build their own pipeline to heat their people might cost a global oil company a few million.
4766 2018-06-21 14:18:25 I dropped the bottle of oil and the fun really began!!!
4767 2018-06-21 14:18:17 It looks like they make engine oil but not brake fluid.
4768 2018-06-21 14:18:02 Whew.
Sorry.
Rookie city mum mistake.
Though it might help explain her lifting the cannabis oil ban.

4794 2018-06-21 14:14:58 We don’t take oil. We receive oil in exchange for services such as settling uprisings against the democracy that is trying to take root. As for the the slave trade, thats just a whole bunch of conspiracy BS. Unless you have some proof such as military files or something like that

Blindly following an extremely flawed man who is a self-serving Narcissistic Snake Oil Salesman who is real on cares about his pocket!!  But he sold himself well, sadly!!

Our major question for any candidate now at major levels of political offices should be: how do we survive with our major income still coming from oil?
Nigerians let's think critically
4806 2018-06-21 14:13:40 The government in Guyana trying to run an economy based on oil profits?? 

(best laugh I had all morning)

They can start, since they'll be so 'flush with cash' by repaying the United States every dime we've ever given them...with interest.

You know this won't end well.

The delivery of oil revenues to Tripoli will support terrorism, especially for a tender invasion. Must keep the revenue in the central bank  #Barqah
4825 2018-06-21 14:11:15 Still decades late to the party & the Saudis had so little notion of oil, they hoped they'd find water. They also rejected England because Churchill gifted them a car that insulted the king because the driver sat on the wrong side. See or read Yergin's documentary The Prize.
4826 2018-06-21 14:10:53 Let's say it does. It will be short-lived as farmers will quickly adjust production. Tough to stockpile food, unlike steel and oil. Long-term we all pay more with tariffs in place.

4843 2018-06-21 14:08:40 A customer told me he used to work in Nigeria for oil () and they used to call him oyinbo and they’d never address him as anything else. I almost felt bad for laughing in his face.

He keeps doing this and his drones deem to be oblivious to it, The Emperor's new clothes have nothing on this snake oil salesman.
4845 2018-06-21 14:08:21 VFF almost a $8 handle. Another great multi-bagger for me. Already sold a bit in its last major run. Got lucky since they were organic veggies to marijuana. NEPT was krill oil and now oils for marijuana, not sure if they spin one or other out so each can try to thrive by itself.

4852 2018-06-21 14:07:26 Long the dollar. With higher oil, more dollar demand too.
4853 2018-06-21 14:07:15 For last many years, prices of oil were manipulated by our government to increase revenue in order to meet it's lavish expenditures.

4868 2018-06-21 14:05:34 I.e. immediate UBI disbursement. The wealth fund sounds interesting, but it is just more long term and unusual for U.S. govt, though oil producers have it. Estate taxes are already attacked as double taxation or death taxes; the wealth fund doesn’t make it any more palatable.

4887 2018-06-21 14:03:42 It's been like this for as long as I can remember. It's why the oil industry here never developed a Scottish Schlumberger or Baker Hughes or a Kvaerner.

4890 2018-06-21 14:03:27 That’s NOT what the National Oceans Policy did.  It was a massive bureaucratic takeover of coastal development zones and inland waterways. It had little or nothing to do with oil spills, except that it would shut down oil industries.

2) Do you think scots are wrong to want to run their own country?
I look forward to your honest reply

5055 2018-06-21 13:43:59 They crafted this decree to avoid ending their policy. It's unconstitutional to keep kids in prisons for an extended period of time, which they would be with their parents. They're getting what they want. Obfuscation and snake oil paperwork.
5056 2018-06-21 13:43:59 The UK's £60m cannabis oil industry looks to go mainstream . . .

How long will it be before a  black market  is developed for cannabis oil . . . or is it already active.

5058 2018-06-21 13:43:42 Also if you missed it, Trump signed a resolution negating the Obama era protection of oceans, Pompeo canceled an update to the Senate about the NK deal (cause it no longer exists) and Koch Bro's are actually tanking plans for clean transportation so we can use more of their oil.

帰ってきて座る暇なく夕飯準備して娘迎えに行って、相手しながら夕飯作って、風呂洗って風呂入れて、夕飯食べさせて歯磨きさせて寝かしつけて。全部一続きですが？そんな暇どこにあるんです？
5062 2018-06-21 13:43:07 US runs an oil deficit with Canada no matter how you measure it. Let’s shut it down completely until Canada starts taking our oil at balance. Who cares that fuel prices will go through the roof. It’s all about equality in trade, right?
5063 2018-06-21 13:43:02 Efectivamente, a inicios de 2016 comenté que el #crudeoil #crude #oil norteamericano debería en vez de caer a los 15 #usd, debería subir buscando inicialmente zonas de 57 dólares USA para quizás a futuro alcanzar los 76. El tiempo siempre da o quita razones.

5066 2018-06-21 13:42:09 My wife used bio oil during 2 pregnancies. It worked pretty well and helped her prevent stretch marks. We realised it works as a preventative measure not as a curator not to remove the stretch marks.
5067 2018-06-21 13:42:06 Uy señor, lamento informarle que Duque propuso abiertamente hacer fracking. Otra cosa es que usted no haya investigado las propuestas. Lo invito a ver este debate entre Duque y Petro organizado por EXPO OIL y GAS. Ojalá me equivoque, pero es obvio que Duque inpulsará el Fracking

5069 2018-06-21 13:41:57 I understand the worry; we went through the same her due to the oil downturn + provincial & federal policy.

The fact is Ontario's finances are an absolute boondoggle; changes need to be made. In the end, if the course is stayed and managed well the entire province will benefit.

5085 2018-06-21 13:40:24 Son tapped a guy with expired foreign license, so no cops involved and minimal damage. 2 months later they start “seeing doctors”, but balked when my insurer asked for papers. They think son was working for me in oil biz. Totally wrong on many levels.

5107 2018-06-21 13:38:17 One of the things that makes me angriest about Louisiana state politics is how GOP reps have cratered state finances so badly, even liberals are demanding their state reps support regressive sales taxes.

Y'all this state has oil.

5116 2018-06-21 13:36:56 It is worth mentioning that the world is round and what gets put out there always comes back to you. I fear the day of reprisal that this country and its cohorts face. So many innocent lives senselessly ended to further an agenda of oil and dollar hegemony.

5192 2018-06-21 13:28:01 There is no "problem to be solved". And if there was, killing Canada's energy sector is not the answer. Every barrel of oil not from Canada will come from another country. Qatar, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, etc stand to profit because YOUR righteous feelings. Shame on you.

5199 2018-06-21 13:27:22 Yeah. A Prof from Baze University hit me from behind late last year, I let him go. was servicing my car a few months and met him at the service station and man bought me Mobil 1, since then I vowed to not go back to "normal oil" after the experience.
5200 2018-06-21 13:27:09 If there IS a Hell, I think they have Muzak with Florence Henderson singing the Wesson Oil song on repeat.  And maybe Celine Dion "My heart will go on."
5201 2018-06-21 13:26:31 I just used one of those olive oil packs u can get from the pharmacy. You can probably find MUCH better ones than that tho

5207 2018-06-21 13:25:20 Things I've had great success with:
1. I know it sounds crazy, but Mayo instead of oil is 
2. Reverse searing: get the doneness you want in the oven, then sear on a red hot pan. I'll never go back.

5213 2018-06-21 13:24:23 They might be sebaceous filaments instead of blackheads. If so, you just need to tone down the oil on your nose, and they disappear. You have to keep doing it though, because as soon as the oil returns, so do they. Blotting papers work fairly well.
5214 2018-06-21 13:24:16 Soybean meal sales of 115100 tonnes and 210100 tonnes of shipments continue to run nicely ahead of their weekly normals. Same comments for soybean oil sales of 16000 t and shipments of 29900 tonnes.

5216 2018-06-21 13:24:10 This concept was a prototype aiming to get info on the type of oil, type of plastic,improvements and the practicality of the pyrolysis theory.Even the oil we got in terms of quality and quantity was low cause it was a prototype. The real machine is environmentally friendly.
5217 2018-06-21 13:24:02 Back in school,I woke up midnight to the smell of Groundnut oil. Nothing was cooking but I it took me a while to realise my Ghanaian Roommate was using it as Lube to masturbate.
5218 2018-06-21 13:23:53 gotta take this truck to my daddy so that I can get this oil changed .
5219 2018-06-21 13:23:44 Isn't that chart the problem to be solved? Our government is doing shit so Canada will fail in meeting #ParisAgreement targets. 
Not sure if the senario takes into account government subsidies for oil and gas, or the failed promises to remove them. Do you?
5220 2018-06-21 13:23:42 Don't let nutritious turnip or radish greens go go to waste.  Both can be sauteed with garlic and butter; sliced and added to soups, stews or casseroles;  or steamed and tossed with lemon juice, garlic, olive oil and black pepper.

5228 2018-06-21 13:22:20 So you're saying there wasn't a market crash & oil companies didn't lay off thousands of workers? Is that what you're saying, meat head, because you can't lie your way out of historical facts. Are you paid directly from the #UCP has a troll or is this just your passion in life?

5238 2018-06-21 13:21:24 Yep. Not just Iran also oil alignment. On the Russian side gcc investment along with Chinese has been a major source of FDI as other companies scattered though it’s not clear what economic returns investment on that have been. I think politics bigger driver

We just came up with a Tech to help the Oil Sector and the push back is similar to the previous two.. @bpsr_ng Why?

However removing it was AWFUL, I have huge welts from where my skin came off with the tape. I guess I have thin skin?? What are some tricks to avoid this? Oil and a hot warm cloth helped.
5247 2018-06-21 13:20:53 @AlfaRomeoUK bit disappointed that my 2011 Giulietta Cloverleaf’s turbo has given up at 50k especially when I read about the revised oil supply pipe on newer models! #CommonFault

5277 2018-06-21 13:17:23 This is all super self explanatory though. Of course it's similar to other types of tape-- it's tape. Of course you wouldn't want to apply it directly to your nipples-- it's tape. Agree they could've just called their coconut oil, coconut oil, but they never claim it's MEDICAL.

5294 2018-06-21 13:16:08 Stop black campaigns that eliminate the income of millions of people who depend their fates from oil palm. Come and visit and see how the Roundtable Sustainable Palm Oil is run! Damage on this earth is not just because of oil palm.
5295 2018-06-21 13:15:59 .86ppg as an oiler. Highest of all Oil players from 2010 to 2015. Best possession player we had until mcd. Top 3 forward in zone exits league wide I believe in those years as well, meaning he was helpful defensively. Perhaps we're both showing bias?

5299 2018-06-21 13:15:46 It’s amazing but have to mix it with another oil like say Olive or Coconut. (I’d suggest olive because coconut isn’t as amazing for me personally).

5305 2018-06-21 13:14:51 This concept was more of a prototype aiming to get info on the type of oil and improvements. Samples of the oil was taken by EMMA results given. The actual machine is environmental friendly using gas and the tank is airlocked  having flitter mechanisms and a cooling system.

If frizz and dryness are an issue, try oiling before the wash and dove leave in with one drop of argon oil per squirt of the conditioner bottle.
Hope it goes well 
5322 2018-06-21 13:13:23 21 tamil fishermen stranded in Iran? They were fishing or exploring crude oil fields?

NDDC should be looking at areas of comparative advantages in aquaculture development, rice farming ,capacity building ,fishing implement and tools for riverine communities who are invariably oil producing community.
5325 2018-06-21 13:12:36 Yeah he probably overstated it. They likely perform market research to see what segments to target and what claims are likely to generate sales of their snake oil.

5328 2018-06-21 13:12:18 Why should Albertans buy from any other province- all other Canadians block and refuse to let Alberta sell its oil products.  USA is currently the only willing and capable buyer. So alberta is more politically aligned to USA under Trump admin.

For some reason most observers believe that OPEC is fully independent of major oil companies.
Supply constraints urged by “environmentalists” also a component of effort to maintain profitable balance

5334 2018-06-21 13:11:36 #ECHO - latest RNS on oil discovery - "very significant", "material scale", "material and potentially transformational", "exceeding high case expectations". All sounds rather positive.
5335 2018-06-21 13:11:31 Waiting on my car for an oil change. Older guy in a veterans hat talking to his neighbor about rising sea levels. 
5336 2018-06-21 13:11:17 "Welcome to America" The day America no longer wars for oil or other buisness, you can spit in the face of the world. Not before, thank you in advance.
5337 2018-06-21 13:11:13 Just like diamonds, the “powers that be” keep the price of oil artificially high and collude with each other.   It’s not going to change.

*Younger Son - What is oil made of?

*Me - It depends on what it is; like olive oil is from olives and coconut oil is from coconuts.

*Older Son - So what is baby oil made of?

USA should be the leader in this, other countries should be buying our energy technologies, not China

5351 2018-06-21 13:10:01 don't know, in any context, the minister's remark, but nothing doesn't end, oil is considered a kind of asset that will expire through time unless undiscovered.
5352 2018-06-21 13:09:58 @ThinkingPutty Aaron what is the difference between silicone oil, polydimethylsiloxane, and dimethicone when sourcing better materials for making putty as oppsoed to glue, contact lense solution, and or liquid or powered starch?  TEACH ME SENPAI!
5353 2018-06-21 13:09:52 He’s playing the game, trying to appease the Greens. It’s a Marketing strategy, nothing more. Internally, they’re focus is on oil and gas.

Looks like their strategy is working

5357 2018-06-21 13:09:37 That's his way of cutting emissions. No industry no emissions. No oil, no car industry next they'll go after the farmers and mandate how many hours they can work in the field/ running the machinary during harvest.

5383 2018-06-21 13:04:51 KM knew it wasn't viable long ago. They sent the money they raised for it to head office, and then spun off a Canadian company. Even now they have no money to build it. Lots of court cases against it

5403 2018-06-21 13:02:19 Auto companies are slow to embrace EV Technology same as GOV , Big Oil and Ethanol , EV are 75% less maintenance, no pollution , less moving parts ,3 dollars = 150+ miles . Your not buying DC Blended Swamp gas or Oil , their not make it money

5410 2018-06-21 13:00:52 ฝนตก
5411 2018-06-21 13:00:48 God is in charge.  (Maybe, Trump should prepare for another oil spill.)
5412 2018-06-21 13:00:46 Please don't pound praise growth in june 2018 like you did oil and nat gas stocks in June 2008.  It is your job to warn people.  You can say this is church of what is working for the next 15 minutes.  But everyone in high beta growth will lose 45% most likely.
5413 2018-06-21 13:00:45 ไม่ได้อยากรู้สึกแย่อ่ะ แต่ต้องมาเป็นคืออะไร TT
5414 2018-06-21 13:00:45 You can't wall off the ocean, but Trump's planning on drilling for oil in every inch of it (and the Great Lakes, as well). Those waters are American treasures and not his to plunder!

5418 2018-06-21 13:00:24 The story no-one's talking about: @realDonaldTrump has just opened up US waters to big oil and other exploitation, repealing an @BarackObama era policy that put #conservation and #sustainability first...

5430 2018-06-21 12:59:19 In FL the legal is an oil that can be vaped. No burning when you use it. That & the fact it doesn’t smell are the only reasons I like it.  I was only able to smoke flower at night in my apt.  Now I can medicate during the day if need be.
5431 2018-06-21 12:58:59 They scared that the world is slowly moving away from fossil fuels so they need to sell as much of their oil while price is still good.

Ooh also a friend swears by a dash of argon oil along with the conditioner
5435 2018-06-21 12:58:48 Tak ikut budak twitter. Haha. Ikut bacaan. Sebab ada baca somewhere kalau nk skincare kena ikut concentration. Kalau letak oil dulu before gel, obviously gel takkan serap dah. So moisturiser dulu.

5557 2018-06-21 12:45:05 Some oil reserves might “expire” if you believe in stranded assets theory. Not to mention reserve valuation might depreciate over time so depreciation isn’t an “expiration” per se but close enough to be relevant to needing to eat your yogurt by a certain date to avoid sickness

5598 2018-06-21 12:39:40 The US oil industry is not government owned like most of the other oil producing countries,  The US President has no influence or control on output.

5611 2018-06-21 12:38:44 Happy to argue this one at the euro area level - a 5% of EA GDP current account surplus would be very large (think that's consequence of 1.05 tho depends a bit on oil price).   Surplus would be similar in size to the US pre-crisis deficit --e.g. too big not impact global economy

With cancer, relif of stress & returns appetite. With PTSD it calms . Prescription drugs are far more dangerous.
5632 2018-06-21 12:35:34 Fonda went on a rant about Obama during the BP oil catastrophe in the Gulf. He called Obama an "f'ing traitor." That never made MSM though because Obama was their Messiah. So what, that it took him 2 weeks to acknowledge the oil spill destroying the gulf?

5887 2018-06-21 12:08:07 @CrabtreeUK Could you tell me how you can justify including palm oil - causing appalling social and environmental harm - in your 'Handmade Traditional Shortbread' and which advertises that it is 'a traditional Scottish recipe made with the finest quality butter' ?
5888 2018-06-21 12:08:06 They are all bought and paid for by a toxic combination of oil money and Russian money. They know that he's evil and they know that he's going to get us all killed, but he brought in a shitload of money and now they can't quit him or he tattles on where they got it.
5889 2018-06-21 12:08:06 To not accept the premise of the question, think the issue here is that data would not be considered fungible and arguably therefore not a commodity. Although we may think of different grades like with oil?
5890 2018-06-21 12:07:37 Its not so much that it helps you, its just the BIG picture has shown (even that moron Cramer finally acknowledged his 2014 #oil Tax Cut was crapolla) that stupidly cheap oil HELPS NO ONE and really HURTS in long run everyone!

Oils are very versatile. Each has a variety of uses, and you can mix them together to multiply the benefits.

6016 2018-06-21 11:50:19 Trump tweets aside... are lower oil prices really bad for the US? Seems like that would drive lower prices for nearly everything. Oil still in ground, we can get it out later. I don’t understand why it’s bad (other than ST for shale companies).
6017 2018-06-21 11:50:17 the UN already developed a low tech variant of this: two hard plastic lenses with a thin layer of clear mineral oil between them. by regulating the amount of oil inside each lens using a little knob, the person can adjust their eyesight themselves.

6152 2018-06-21 11:28:20 There's a myth that turning your engine on and off consumes fuel - that's only an issue if you're using a low grade oil. Decent oils that are the correct type for your car protect your engine from the moment you turn the key so don't worry about turning it off at the lights!

6157 2018-06-21 11:28:00 1/ I'm wary of BP's oil 'consumption' figure. 2/I see transition to gas cutting demand for oil 3/The more expensive oil gets the more profitable for China to find smart means of saving it #FifthFuel #EnergyasaService #OOTT

6159 2018-06-21 11:26:29 @realDonaldTrump now ur Tweets seem to be making the Saudis want to pump more with #russia & start another #oil price war. It took 3 years to get oil balanced. Even @HaroldHamm said recently #LessIsMore. U.S. needs $65 to survive. This war WE CANT WIN!

6162 2018-06-21 11:25:20 Plus the chemical in weed is THC which for anyone who has been stoned can cause paranoia. The medical Cannabis oil is different. It has CBD in it instead of THC.

6164 2018-06-21 11:25:11 Exactly. Mining oil for profit and sustainability are not 2 compatible words.
6165 2018-06-21 11:25:10 ... man yeah... meanwhile, I attended a PhD defense of some Ugandan who said that the oil that chaps keep recycling is not healthy, so be careful when you go to the beach... U could even consider carrying your own fresh oil and then U ask them to use it for frying lol

6169 2018-06-21 11:24:49 Good for a ramp I’m sure, just amazes me how many genuinely seem to believe all the hype and think that they’ve found something unique at such an early stage - in some parts of the world it would be big news if you didn’t find any gold/oil etc!
6170 2018-06-21 11:24:37 hello yes i’ve got koolpacs now on rotation and i’ve been usuing aloe vera gel and st. john’s wort oil. with that combo i think it’s a bit cooler today. i’m still wipes out alas :-(

** Asia markets close mixed overnight as trade concerns simmer; oil prices slip

6172 2018-06-21 11:24:33 Yes it works.. I mixed it with a few drops of lavender essential oil to alliviate the smell. You'll see results in a 2weeks. You can get the lavender oil at D-scam
6173 2018-06-21 11:24:22 Be sincere, is Nigeria in 2018? I strongly believe Nigeria is still a century backward. How do you explain the reoccurrent Ojuelegba bridge accident, mass massacre in Zamfara, crude oil war, et al.
6174 2018-06-21 11:24:15 Democrats and Republicans are owned by the insurance companies, monsanto, weapons industry and oil tycoons.  They foster discontent and climate collapse.  Eat some watermelon, and smell a flower while you still can.  Have a great day!
6175 2018-06-21 11:24:06 Besides the water falls, the town is famous for its two temples, Thirukuttralanathar and the another one dedicated to Lord Muruga.

6179 2018-06-21 11:23:15 The anti-fracking campaign - some legit, most nonsensical - is part of the reactionary left in Oz. Driven by Putin, afraid of US shale driving down oil prices, it is a passing issue. The NFF is wise to not get involved.

6183 2018-06-21 11:22:12 Are lower oil prices coming ? Seems like an agreement to raise oil output is in place with Iran sounding more constructive. Real debate is how much ?? Consensus is roughly 400-600k bpd, but headlines earlier today suggest a bigger output increase. @opec #OPECSeminar #Oil

6289 2018-06-21 10:59:12 That would make an epic picture. Those oil paintings you get round RHQ. You, half under your unhappy mount, holding the scabbard & battering bits of chopped up gas bottles around the capital. A transit smouldering in background with two blokes exiting stage right on a moped.

2) Do you think scots are wrong to want to run their own country?
I look forward to your reply
6362 2018-06-21 10:47:20 I do understand the difference thanks. I've not come across many cases where CBD oil has a THC content. My experience is purely CBD oil. And that stuff works very well! As much as I'd love to be, can't be stoned 24/7 like when I was a student, so CBD oil is the ideal solution.
6363 2018-06-21 10:47:15 Okay let me break it down. It's a technical red oil but lab tested that has low free fatty acid .
In other words it's equivalent to special Palm oil.

6405 2018-06-21 10:37:40 It's a 1:1:1 ratio in terms of volume of egg to flour to milk. Do it like that, good whisk, let it chill for 30mins, heat the oil up to 200c. Add batter mix to the heated oil pans and cook for 20mins. DO NOT OPEN the oven for those 20 mins. PERFECT Yorkshire Puddings. - R

6421 2018-06-21 10:32:23 Energy should be regionalised, we have an abundance of natural energy sources, could be near free. oil is an unpredictable market and damaging to the atmosphere, if it is to be used the revenue has to be put in to alternative source development, this is the obvious future.

6445 2018-06-21 10:28:14 TMX has destroyed Trudeau’s credibility on climate. He’s allowing AB to grow oil sands ghg emissions by nearly 50% in exchange for closing coal plants that had reached end of life & for a price on carbon low enough to be ineffective. Lib climate plan is a fraud.

6460 2018-06-21 10:25:10 We should also ask where decades of oil revenue have gone. In this period Norway has put aside about $1trillion from oil revenues without impacting other services. Successive British Governments appear to have lost this lucrative source of money. Where did that money go?

6464 2018-06-21 10:23:44 I’d restate. Biggest problem for all low cost energy & power sources is excess supply. It’s been a recognized business challenge since earliest days of Standard Oil.
Rockefeller’s genius was recognition that limiting supply was necessary part of making the enterprise profitable

6474 2018-06-21 10:21:53 I don't buy a lot of Beavertown beer as it is, but that is because I am always looking to try new things but if I can pick up 4 cans of Neck Oil for £6, or get a pint of it in a pub where usually you would have to choose from the usual suspects, that is good for me.
6475 2018-06-21 10:21:44 It's an interesting point. Based on what sells in London (eg Neck Oil, Pils), I think they'd do ok with v fresh LC Pale Ale, a few other hoppy beers, a lager or two and maybe a token out-there beer.

7256 2018-06-21 07:55:50 moisturising and time works in my experience, i used to use oil, and make sure ur rlly gentle when doing all of this, because rubbing hard can make it more red depending on the scare
7257 2018-06-21 07:55:38 Well, having more members is generally thought a good thing by political parties. Then again, having oil is seen as a good thing in most countries, and it seems to be a curse for Scotland, so let's see what happens ;-)

7347 2018-06-21 07:36:06 It's insincere of NASS to say that the N139b budgeted for them in 2018 is 'far below' the 2015 level of N150b, because the difference is only N11b. Besides, oil revenues on which the country depend are no longer robust. So, NASS must also learn to make sacrifice & take less
7348 2018-06-21 07:35:45 Skincare Tip:

7356 2018-06-21 07:34:20 the price of electric, gas and oil are will soar as fewer people use these resources and no longer have need to buy them from traditional companies

7913 2018-06-21 05:46:40 Funny how people cannot have it any other way than the good vs the bad. No doubt the auto barons, big oil and bankers are a bunch of crooks. However, it does not automatically make a personality cult pumping some other toys for the rich subsidized by the poor the good guys.

7915 2018-06-21 05:46:24 #SouthSudanOil...There is a high hope that peace is coming to South Sudan, and that those displaced by the conflict will return to their homes. But for those whose homes have been made almost inhospitable by oil exploration, where will they return to? @hz_soh @oilwatchafrica1

7940 2018-06-21 05:42:36 I use olive oil, Worcestishire sauce, red cooking wine, fresh garlic, onion, banana peppers, then salt & pepper
7941 2018-06-21 05:42:06 Heat olive oil up on a spoon on top of fire till it’s lukewarm pour it in your ear and put a cotton ball in it!
7942 2018-06-21 05:41:50 Avocado oil. It contains proteins and healthy fats, amino acids and vitamins A, D, E and B6. The proteins will help fill in damaged airs in your hair’s cuticles, repairing damage that’s already been done and preventing future breakage and frizz.

7950 2018-06-21 05:40:04 New article believed military coup in 2018 due to zero oil production, debts to other countries, can’t pay military, etc. New government to take over food , meds problem. Hope this is right and military turns against Maduro when not paid, no food, etc

7956 2018-06-21 05:38:37 China and Russia are also not far behind USA - both Tibet n Xinjiang are forcibly occupied by communist China, same for Crimea in Ukraine forcefully occupied by Russia and do not forget Chinese hegemony in South China Sea for Oil n Gas.
7957 2018-06-21 05:38:27 I use shatter with sunflower lecithin in coconut oil. Super potent. 
7958 2018-06-21 05:37:57 Honestly CO will give moisture but it won’t repair damage. The only way to repair damage is to either cut it off and start new or use better products to repair. With repeated use coconut oil may cause protein build up, making your hair further stiff, hard and less elasticity.
7959 2018-06-21 05:37:41 Awesome because i was gonna do it like a pernil. Adobo sazon oregano and kosher coarse salt rubbed on with oil.

7988 2018-06-21 05:30:09 Try CBD oil if you can it provides the happy effects without the high druggy feelings. Or you can the CBD oil that gives the high druggy effects without the harmful ones but i forget what that one is specifically.
7989 2018-06-21 05:29:56 I was just using this exact same reference to my sis who is 5 months post-partum. Here I am, 2 YEARS post-partum and it is only just happening to me in the past 3 months. It is freaking me the hell out. I am downing biotin pills and showering hair with castor oil. This is MADNESS

7995 2018-06-21 05:29:02 I wondered why they would be doing this? What if they gained control of all oil/gas companies so that they had control over rationing out supplies. By doing that, they gained control of populations.The glitch in that plan is mass public transit! Get rid of public transit? CONTROL

8003 2018-06-21 05:28:19 A thoroughly bogus way to calculate BE price! 
GlobalDataEnergy takes Capex/EUR+Opex/EUR= BE.  So $7.5mm D&C+ 4mm opex with an EUR of 550 kboe=$21.  Excludes royalty,cost of capital/discount, taxes, etc & is independent of oil price! No company has 550 kboe as an avg well anyway.

8187 2018-06-21 04:56:46 happy tonight, but when i wake up the pain will dawn on me like a duck in an oil spill
8188 2018-06-21 04:56:40 I get followed by a new “beard” company everyday but all you need in this life is a boar bristle brush from cvs and generic coconut oil. 
8189 2018-06-21 04:56:34 I went to high school with this girl. She’s off her rocker cus she wasn’t allowed to take over her family’s oil transportation biz. She must have gone haywire cus now she is all about locking up kids and stuff. What a freak.
8190 2018-06-21 04:56:28 I was supposed to do my oil pastels artwork last night but hwehehwhe Dilan 1990 was the current priority
8191 2018-06-21 04:56:11 Apparently you didn't pay attention when oil shit tanked so the companies fired a ton of their employees even though they still rake in the billions? You missed that little nugget there, meat head? Wow. #Clueless
8192 2018-06-21 04:56:04 You mean the politics of the majority of CDN’s wanting project? Or maybe the best way to retaliate against trump is to take away his ability to buy our oil at a discount. Or maybe all those who are doing all the whining are famous for not voting or making political contributions

8197 2018-06-21 04:55:00 #Engineoil keeps all the components within your car’s engine properly lubricated.  All you need to do to check your oil, is open the hood & check the level on the oil dipstick. If it is too low, it needs to be refilled. 
This should be done by a professional mechanic.#autocare

8209 2018-06-21 04:52:27 It can be hard to find the right oil for combination skin so if these don't work for you, using 2 different oils for the dry and oily parts of your face (such as Jojoba and Almond Oil) may be beneficial. Toning your skin can also create a more neutral base for oil application.
8210 2018-06-21 04:52:19 Spiders really don’t like Peppermint oil. I soaked cotton balls with a diluted Peppermint oil and put them behind every appliance. Spiders came crawling out from everywhere. Have to do it again every month though.

8213 2018-06-21 04:51:23 That’s the palm oil. It ruins the taste.

8216 2018-06-21 04:50:37 There is no such thing as sustainably produced palm oil. Also, palm oil alters the taste of chocolate & we can’t have that! Buy Lindt chocolate, which has the added benefit of being non-Halal.

8226 2018-06-21 04:48:48 Oil prices fell on Thursday as Iran signaled it could be won over to a small rise in OPEC crude output, potentially paving the way for the producer cartel to agree a supply increase during a meeting on Friday.

8324 2018-06-21 04:33:04 I don’t even know how to change my oil young bul. So that’s out lmao
8325 2018-06-21 04:33:02 I think there's a difference between medical cannabis (oil) and smoking pot. They are talking about legalising the former.
8326 2018-06-21 04:32:55 Larsson isn’t on the level of any of those guys cause his skillset is so much more limited than them. But yeah, I respect your opinion and I don’t wanna keep comin off like im bashing him. I’m not. Good, solid dependable, physical, stay at home guy that I like having on the oil
8327 2018-06-21 04:32:51 Absolutely Abominable @Lie
#Trump ran on EU Germany France UK being WORST Immigration Laws. Refugees from Countries Destroyed by US Drug Trade, Arms Deals, Oil & Land Grabs SHOULD come to US for Shelter. War Profiteers, Corps, Billionaires & #GOPTaxScam Windfalls can pay.
8328 2018-06-21 04:32:30 Jojoba oil
8329 2018-06-21 04:32:20 #Oil prices delicately poised as #Iran  flags up it could agree on a small production increase during the #OPEC meeting in Vienna this week.
8330 2018-06-21 04:32:06 ถ้าจะบอกเพราะทวิตเธอทำน้องโดนแซะ 
อ่าวเขาก็ติ่งน้องเหมือนกันปะรักน้องเหมือนกัน ทำแบบนี้เหมือนเด็กพาลเลย 
ไม่ดีนะจ๊ะ ดูที่เจตนาสิ ไม่ใช่โทษไปมั่ว
8331 2018-06-21 04:32:04 that is a brilliant point that people haven't caught on to.
8332 2018-06-21 04:31:59 Sure. Sounds like the guy with oil and no pipeline has thought this through very carefully.
8333 2018-06-21 04:31:37 You completely lost me when you sold out AK, by endorsing the oil tax giveaway, SB21. 

"You're nothing to me now, Fredo"
8334 2018-06-21 04:31:28 Olive Oil: Make sure the oil that you use is extra virgin to avoid additives. Used as a nightly treatment, this oil provides moisture and reduces the skin's oil production. It is antibacterial, soothing for sensitive skin, and doesn't clog pores. Also works to repair damaged skin
8335 2018-06-21 04:30:31 ไม่อยาก อดทน เเล้วอ่ะ เหนื่อยย
8336 2018-06-21 04:30:24 Canada feel free to cut off America's supply of oil, Mexico should do the same.
8337 2018-06-21 04:30:19 気まぐれで共栄のHP見てみたら未だにバタビアコースの紹介で陽の顔が見切れてて草
8338 2018-06-21 04:30:03 Take your crystal healing and chakra cleansing and essential oil defusers and keep them to yourselves.  Just give your kids some damn pepto if they have a belly ache
8339 2018-06-21 04:30:02 ไม่พอใจที่เขาแซะจะห้ามไม่ให้เขาแซะ?บ้าบอ มันเรื่องของเขานะจริงๆ 
แซะมาแซะกลับไม่โกงเครียดทำไม
8340 2018-06-21 04:30:00 You too man, oil me up we just got some slots
8341 2018-06-21 04:29:49 Also because big oil lines his pockets  Idiots don’t even care they are destroying the planet for ALL future generations, maybe that’s what space force is for -millionaires in space after destroying earth 
8342 2018-06-21 04:29:46 @GBRacingEU 
Your cover for my FZ09 never quit leaking oil. Took it off and ordered OEM engine case..Took your product to the range and shoot it to pieces with my American .45 automatic something you Brits can't do...Haha.
8343 2018-06-21 04:29:10 橋の上めっちゃ風強くて気持ちいい
8344 2018-06-21 04:28:55 Swiss chard sauteed in olive oil with garlic. Kale sauteed in olive oil and garlic. Blue oyster mushrooms sauteed in olive oil and butter and garlic. I need some new ideas, I guess.
8345 2018-06-21 04:28:55 On a more important note this rose hip seed oil always has my face feeling soft 
8346 2018-06-21 04:28:48 คิดถึงได้ไหม งอแงได้ไหม 
8347 2018-06-21 04:28:41 I thought that legalising medicinal cannabis oil was the idea. Not cannabis for recreational use.
8348 2018-06-21 04:28:16 Offshore companies have some great looking charts $MO $RIG - I do not even like oil right now but they are intriguing charts
8349 2018-06-21 04:28:08 The US is almost self sufficient in oil. Since they are essentially our only customer for our oil, and given energy is 20% of our GDP,  we would be in deep shit if Trump put tariffs on our oil. We cannot win a trade war. We are 1/10 the size of their economy.
8350 2018-06-21 04:28:05 รักน้องมาก ไม่โลกสวยใดใด 
ทำคือทำ สวยคือสวย รักด้อมนี้มาตลอดเดี๋ยวนี้เป็นอะไรกันไปวะ น้องไม่ใช่คนที่จะแตะต้องวิจารณ์ไม่ได้ เก็ตมะ

8356 2018-06-21 04:26:46 More and more oil, to your elbow your Excellency sir.
8357 2018-06-21 04:26:34 On your way down, you reach down and pull the cord, and the bag dispenses a dollop of coconut oil, you know that the sales clerk got your order wrong.
8358 2018-06-21 04:26:20 Haha, there is a reason Emma is a single mother..
To be fair, I'm no fan of Fiona but she dropped by my house once on part of a door knocking campaign, she is no oil painting but she really looks worse in photos than live, where Emma is the other way round.
8359 2018-06-21 04:26:11 That would be even more expensive, this is just regular every day vegetable oil.
8360 2018-06-21 04:26:06 Yea CBD oil has no THC in it which is the primary chemical for marijuana and its use. CBD Oil is useful for many non euphoric reasons.  And no I never promoted nothing in my tweet lol. I can freely tweet just like you can buddy ;)
8361 2018-06-21 04:25:54 how much hash oil can I get for an unusual fedora with stink effect

8365 2018-06-21 04:25:28 I've been in both situations (not too sure about the oil, though.) I feel you, friend!
8366 2018-06-21 04:25:22 Somehow I got pepermint oil above my upper lip n the sensation is fucking urking me

8370 2018-06-21 04:24:55 I must get into the Oil Field ....
8371 2018-06-21 04:24:39 Sunflower Oil: Contains Linoleic Acid, which is anti-inflammatory and reduces acne (great for oily skin) and also retains the skin's moisture for the dry parts of your face. It is soothing and healing, and also contains Vitamin E and beta-carotene for healthy-looking skin
8372 2018-06-21 04:24:25 The Dems Are About The Only Sane Ones Holding America Down. You Repubs Done Lost Y’all F&@king Minds. Don’t Worry The Snake  Oil Conman Is Going To Jail Right Along With Cohen, Flynn & Manafort!!

8375 2018-06-21 04:23:59 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.
8376 2018-06-21 04:23:53 John Bolton statement interpretation: "We don't need advice by the UN or other international bodies on who we can invade, how many millions of people we can or can't kill. Why our sovereignty is important but other oil rich country need our resource management..

8380 2018-06-21 04:23:11 No oil is the worst texture
8381 2018-06-21 04:23:07 And how would they know if you used butter or oil?
I mean, sure, they'd know if you used soy milk, because everything would taste like diluted plaster of Paris, but butter and oil?
8382 2018-06-21 04:23:06 Did she go for a swim in hot oil?

8386 2018-06-21 04:22:34 Which lead to invade and Take Resources "Rinse&Repeat" they got hand caught in the Cookie Jar with Iran.

And since that time it amped up after Kissenger coined "Petro Dollar" which was based upon U.S. Currency.
Meaning other countries needed U.S. Currency to buy oil From S.A.+
8387 2018-06-21 04:22:22 Imagine if we had an American population that paid attention to all positive things happening under President Trumps administration instead of falling inline with democratic snake oil salesman and #fakenews lift the veil liberals #MAGA
8388 2018-06-21 04:22:19 Basilica, UCP believes if you can hold a hammer you are ready to graduate and go work in the oil field.  Look at their leader barely graduated HS, failed to get a superstition degree.
8389 2018-06-21 04:22:06 Yes, that’s the only place you’ll find it. Get that lip oil 
8390 2018-06-21 04:22:02 So essentially Oil traded away Hart and Calder winners for Larsson, Reinhart, and Lucic #ouch
8391 2018-06-21 04:22:00 I'm currently struggling with skin moisture. My face is looking dehydrated but I think I'm almost over that. I've just been slacking a lot lately.
For my body I went back to some good ol' olive oil that my mom used to use on me when I was a baby and it's been helping a lot
8392 2018-06-21 04:21:34 Sensitive dgb Salicylic Acid.

I opt for Mndelic Acid 5% dari wishtrend and acne cream dari himalaya. And Safflower facial oil to replace linolic acid.
8393 2018-06-21 04:21:29 *douses arms in baby oil so you can’t ever get a grip on or off the raft*
8394 2018-06-21 04:21:18 The literal only thing i ever think about is pastabilities spicy tomato oil
8395 2018-06-21 04:21:05 Nama Oil Well pun dah pelik “Sepat” aku sepak skali karang haha
8396 2018-06-21 04:20:49 You can get isopropyl myristate at namies or nigels, its an oil used to get off sfx glue like pros aide
8397 2018-06-21 04:20:44 Well with or without McDavid Oil were nowhere close to the playoffs. Both Mckonnon and Hall dragged their carcass' that they call teams into the first round. So that takes the cake for me.
8398 2018-06-21 04:20:09 I’m mad my dad is taking like three years to change my oil

8405 2018-06-21 04:18:37 Mystery is somehow gas prices go up around summertime. Even though there is an excess of oil supply on the market. Could it be corporate greed... but hey, I'm just the 99%.

8407 2018-06-21 04:18:24 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
8408 2018-06-21 04:18:16 Arghhhh! Rasa nak pecah otak update project costing untuk job job oil & gas ni! Wahai engineer engineer kenapalah equipment korang pakai ni sangatlah complicated nama dia, pening nak faham 
8409 2018-06-21 04:17:44 And those that peddle snake oil are not?
8410 2018-06-21 04:17:34 It really is, and it's sad. Imagine how much sooner something could've been done if both sides would forget they have a side and just discuss the issues at hand. I'm a proponent of 2 adages: "The squeaky wheel gets the oil" & "You'll attract more flies with honey than vinegar".
8411 2018-06-21 04:17:29 It's not every day  you can come home, after a bourbon here, rye there and more bourbon, and see @czabe (sports writer hero) in your inbox about an interview. Well, stay tuned, folks, if I know Steve, oil, field goal kicks and Vegas will some how connect with bourbon.
8412 2018-06-21 04:17:22 Drain the swamp, fire her, she is part of the swamp!
8413 2018-06-21 04:17:12 That would be my preference too, although I've tried a lot of different products. I was keeping it minimum with a mineral wash and frankincense oil as a moisturizer. I've used tea tree oil, too. The latest experiment is by Lush. I'm using the charcoal cleanser and rose toner.
8414 2018-06-21 04:17:08 Not just smoking. The oil pill takers feel woozy the next day after. Not good for workers safety. Imagine a trucker using marijuana oil and his reaction times the next day change. Do you want your loved ones hit by this kind of driver on the highway?
8415 2018-06-21 04:17:02 Politician frame of mind is universal, except few. I agree with government power. No goverrnment can be as power as the ruling one.But in Indian context everything depends on monsoon to oil. Others are by products between the two
8416 2018-06-21 04:16:55 Gotta get some coconut oil for my baby’s head .. shit mine too
8417 2018-06-21 04:16:43 There is a stark difference between sides. 
Nothing progressives believe in or stand for do I believe in. I dont want to "come together" with them. I understand them and want nothing to do with them.
8418 2018-06-21 04:16:32 Coconut oil & coffee bean masks take my breakouts away! They’re like $5 at Walmart
8419 2018-06-21 04:16:30 Too bad they use most of it for corporate welfare and bombing brown people in other countries for profit and oil.
8420 2018-06-21 04:16:09 He would leap into a vat of boiling oil if he thought he could save his sorry ass!
8421 2018-06-21 04:16:02 I think what she is saying is meaningless in terms of compassion, mercy, goodness... (values)... (you shall know them by their fruit; I am not seeing good fruit from these trees! Get your snake oil here!)
8422 2018-06-21 04:15:57 1 barrel of oil is 42 gallons. All you futures market players should know that. It’s also important to know that a refinery needs 4 barrels to produce 1 barrel of crude oil as a product.
8423 2018-06-21 04:15:44 #BDS is in good company this year with @LulaOficial @LulaPelo_Brasil also nominated and facing prison by a lawfare scheme put in place to get the brazilian large oil fields worth $ 8 TRILLION

8425 2018-06-21 04:15:29 If Trump had his way no one would be able to criticize him

というか上がったら休んで疲労もふくめてコンディション回復しろと10000回くらい言ってるんだなぁ
8427 2018-06-21 04:15:20 Sure did! Altered it just a tinnny bit bc I think my measurements for the second scoop of flour was too much, so I ended up adding just a very small bit of hot water and a lil bit of extra oil than his OG recipe. It still turned out fine tho 
8428 2018-06-21 04:15:14 The #KadunaTwitterConnect.... Followers falling in since last nyt.

8433 2018-06-21 04:13:48 THC extracted and the good ones use coconut oil in them and you vape it. Same as smoking a J w/o the Smokey part and stinky part. None of that with oils
8434 2018-06-21 04:13:46 #21JuneMotivation

Persist and dont give up while you have your strength; as long as the lamp still burns, add oil to it before goes out.

While wearing Follow Treudeu shirt. Wow! USCIS blew that approval.Civility, Manners & Merit critera?NO
8437 2018-06-21 04:13:36 I never thought I'd be the one in my immediate family to have a whole facial routine after I wash up

1) coconut oil
2) some vitamin serum 
3) aton of aloe gel under my eyes (because your girl doesn't want to look like a raccoon/viejita)
8438 2018-06-21 04:13:28 It’s so hard to work retail when you know you could easily go to the oil field and make a lot more money.
8439 2018-06-21 04:13:01 Without oil we wouldn't have plastic stir sticks we all use to stir our hot beverages. Do you want that? #ClimateChange #GlobalWarming

8441 2018-06-21 04:12:42 tea tree oil is a BLESSING
8442 2018-06-21 04:12:07 Overheard in the grocery store:

Woman to cashier: *holding up a small bottle* Do you have this, but for dogs?

Cashier: What is it?

Woman: An essential oil immunity defence booster.

Cashier: Umm...

Woman: I called & they said they had it.

Typical Victoria.

8458 2018-06-21 04:08:12 and her boss(es), too, since they don't have a clue what's happening.   Orrrrr perhaps they dooo?  Then, they can just forfeit their pensions, too.

8480 2018-06-21 04:04:28 How does Blockchain remove the regulatory and licensing barriers to business? Unlicensed hair braiders, barbers, bakers are being shut down. Why? Because regulations and licensing. How does blockchain help CBD oil entrepreneurs without reg help?

8491 2018-06-21 04:02:05 It hasn’t been in long enough for you to even know that.  You cannot say that with certainty.  Scientists/experts and BC experience say otherwise even big oil wants it.  Where’s your data indicating it won’t have an impact?
8492 2018-06-21 04:01:35 bri is naming her baby oliver. so when she gets mad she can be like “shut up olive oil”  this is a legit conversation we’re having.

8494 2018-06-21 04:01:30 The Oil were desperate for D, and no one was going to do the Oil a favour.  The only other return we heard for Hall was Ceci.  Subban and Weber were pipedreams.  I truly believe the number of goals Larsson prevents is > what Hall can produce.  Still a good trade.

8580 2018-06-21 03:46:07 I appreciate that. Personally I strip it down a step further and go without the bell pepper... Tomato, onions, feta, olives, oregano, olive oil, salt & pepper but it's a regional thing. I'm southern Greek and I think the peppers might be northern or western Greek
8581 2018-06-21 03:45:50 I'm sure, I remember reading an article on petite potatoes first trip to China they basically said they refuse to invest a penny in Canada resources like oil unless a pipeline gets built so yeah your right - wish I could find that article to share it

8583 2018-06-21 03:45:28 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor.

8602 2018-06-21 03:42:11 Thanks Matthew, it is both. Venezuela is socialist, it is controlled by the Socialist Party and the government owns or regulates the productivity. Over 1/2 GDP comes from oil which collapsed. If they were a diverse free market economy then they would have more productivity.

8608 2018-06-21 03:41:48 couple drops of eye drops or facial oil will fix it! Works best if you loosen it up first, makes it easier to absorb & stir

8610 2018-06-21 03:41:40 Viviene quickly drew her bow, whirling to face an encroaching darkness. Sounds of the fiend grew near even as a lantern ruptured, flame readily extinguished though plenty of oil remained.
"Damn you" she breathed, sensing this would be her last stand.

8630 2018-06-21 03:38:20 I know sometimes the “technician” doesn’t feel the same way about my car as I do. I can tell when I try to remove an oil filter that was torqued on too hard. Then you have to hammer a screwdriver through the filter to get leverage and oil gets everywhere. Thanks, oil guy.
8631 2018-06-21 03:38:14 From a quick glance I’d assume you’re spot-on. 1/4 cup of soy sauce can be a LOT and sesame oil is flavorful enough that it might cut down on it whereas coconut oil may not change much. I’d honestly suggest doing the soy sauce to taste and adding fish sauce?
8632 2018-06-21 03:38:11 If you can’t afford waxed on a daily. Shave with a five blade razor and olive oil. Or Aloa Vera gel
8633 2018-06-21 03:37:55 If you put a little bit of coconut oil on it should help too

8645 2018-06-21 03:35:54 Interesting ... we’ll make sure they use hard wax ... and not strips ! Very important .. should probably get some exfoliator as well because that’s essential after it’s done and find an after shave oil or something
8646 2018-06-21 03:35:40 Exactly. When Africans say that they don't white people there or foreigners in general, it's not racism but for conservation and safety. Most of our oil has been depleted by oil companies like shell and BP. We're still feeling the effects of slavery til today. It's scary
8647 2018-06-21 03:35:34 Well my veggies have a soy sauce additive, possibly less peanut butter. And I used coconut oil instead of sesame, that might've affected it. Definitely the soy or PB

8671 2018-06-21 03:33:01 Many analysts says that #banknifty is showing a lot of strength as compared to #nifty50 which might be true

My opinion - brilliant selling opportunity in Market. If having long positions then just exit! Oil at $75 and #Rupee at 68.2 vs #USD doesn't justify #NIFTYFUTURE valuation

8692 2018-06-21 03:29:29 There you go. You can. Recommend checking the quality of the essential oil before purchasing though. Some are more *pure* than others. It's also used in combination with other scents in bath and shower products and perfumes.

8752 2018-06-21 03:20:54 It dropped 7 cents a litre in Belleville...I don't think the oil companies got the message yet.  Once Ford is signed in as Premier, then we can ask "now what?"
8753 2018-06-21 03:20:50 have you tried tea tree oil? the body shop has some that i’ve been using. i had been on accutane in high school so my acne isn’t as bad but i find this helps with flare ups and quickly dries them out so they go away faster!

8756 2018-06-21 03:20:15 How come the two biggest crimes in the world are NOT being punished? 1- never ending regime change and resource stealing wars! 2- the pollution of our oceans and fresh water by oil and fracking companies!

8772 2018-06-21 03:17:59 I’m so intrigued. With keto, I end up eating a lot of dairy. I don’t think I’ll give up meat, but I know dairy is inflammatory. But there’s only so many avocados and coconut oil you can eat!
8773 2018-06-21 03:17:52 Esp burns bc they were a major antagonist of our civil war, ntm the colonizing up until that point...the snatching of prime land & oil...

8793 2018-06-21 03:14:28 10 % Chinese tariffs on US energy products. 5% of imports would have to be sourced from elsewhere, while cheap US #oil would enter other markets. 

Assuming tempers would subside, the long term infra being built in the US, to supply to China, should continue.

8798 2018-06-21 03:13:36 Another example of how Sessions & Trump don't care if there are rules or protocol. 

Let's not forget, Trump ignored the basic laws of charitable corporations, using his own foundation to pay for his business expenses, including that terrible oil painting hanging at his resort.

8804 2018-06-21 03:13:00 The thing I've enjoyed most about Hall's 2017-18 campaign, is many a media member (especially out east) who were singing Chiarelli's praises during '16-'17, suddenly jumped ship & are all over him now. That should've been the case all along. Be better, it's your damn profession.

8807 2018-06-21 03:12:33 He should retire from the presidency and go on the road with his snake oil show.
He's made a fortune from his months in office, his daughter has her Chinese trademarks & Jared has his mortgage on 666.
Trump should retire while he's ahead.
8808 2018-06-21 03:12:21 Trump planning to:merge department of Ed&Labor,revoke natural citizenships,keep 2600 kids from reuniting w/their parents,undo Ocean policy to drill for oil.  that was just this week.

8817 2018-06-21 03:10:54 this might be obvious to everyone but me, but when interior paint says "oil based" they ain't talking linseed.
8818 2018-06-21 03:10:52 One of the nicest smallest things that made me so happy today is I was talking about needing and oil change so my bf checked my calendar and scheduled it for me tomorrow after work. It’s such a small thing but was so sweet!

8829 2018-06-21 03:08:57 Yeah, plummeting oil prices and growing debt & social spending led to big budget deficits and the government printed money to try and finance the gap.

8832 2018-06-21 03:08:46 You're right - you'd better shut down Alberta's oil and gas industry, since it was developed with government help and continues to rely on it. LOL

Love it when @Alberta_UCP

8837 2018-06-21 03:08:22 So not supporting a certain industry is equal to devaluing humans? When we try to use renewable energy and cut electricity & gas usage we’re hurting the oil & coal industries, so then we’re saying that yhe non-living earth is more important than humans right?
8838 2018-06-21 03:07:53 The department that oversees the wild horses, Bureau of Land Management, doesn't want to manage the horses on public lands anymore. They want to focus on money-making ventures such as oil, gas, and ranching. They want to reduce the number of horses by any means possible.

9013 2018-06-21 02:43:57 What makes you think the US government hasn’t been corrupted by other, or even the same, drug cartels? Or other corrupt organizations? ie the NRA, the oil industry, big pharma, mining, even other countries ...
9014 2018-06-21 02:43:56 That's just what i was trying to accomplish. Oh yeah i got into a fight while getting my oil changed because I put MSNBC on when nobody was looking.
9015 2018-06-21 02:43:46 I’m just like okay that’s ridiculous.. they told me to go into the bank but they are already closed by the time I got out of getting my oil changed
9016 2018-06-21 02:43:23 I cut them in half, spritz lightly with olive oil, season, top with a little bit of red onion and roast them.  At the end, I cover them with white cheddar and back in until cheese is melted.  DELICIOUS!!!
9017 2018-06-21 02:43:19 I take fish oil with omega 3, 500mg Potassium Gluconate, a baby Aspirin, multivitamin, and claratin every day. I never get sick. 

Fish oil feeds the cells. Potassium Gluconate softens arteries/veins. Baby aspirin to defend against heart attack. Multivitamin for general health.

9019 2018-06-21 02:42:14 My birthday wishlist gets more and more boring each year that I get older. This year my big ticket item is an oil change 
9020 2018-06-21 02:42:04 Mine wasn't from a chance burst. Mine was shaking the pan and a splash of oil went on my hand
9021 2018-06-21 02:41:31 i made... a coconut oil sugar scrub. who am i
9022 2018-06-21 02:41:25 How can some people go more than 2 days without washing their hair? Like do u not have oil glands on your scalp or something?
9023 2018-06-21 02:41:21 We R carbon net neutral in Canada, if we truly want 2 #EffectChange we 1st need 2 ensure that all oil & gas coming into Canada adheres 2 our standards 4 environmental & life safety that would B a good 1st step & would #EffectChange CT is income redistribution & effects nothing
9024 2018-06-21 02:41:16 Castor oil + Coconut oil= heaven on my scalp
9025 2018-06-21 02:40:55 I stick to a ketogenic diet, so what I do is melt together 1/2c each of coconut oil and PB, add 1-1/2T cocoa powder & 1t vanilla, pour it in an ice cube tray, and freeze. It’s like a “gourmet” Reese’s, lol. I use PB that’s not overly sweet, but it still satisfies the craving.
9026 2018-06-21 02:40:47 As opposed to Trump who just wants Middle Eastern money and oil to pour in to the country.

9031 2018-06-21 02:40:11 They don’t want to get a handle on the volume of illegals crossing our border. They’re not interested, because they DON’T see illegal immigration as a problem. They’re closet open borders advocates.

This man is a snake oil salesmen, total embarrassment to our country
9032 2018-06-21 02:40:04 These one day trips to sac got me changin my oil wayyy before I should be 
9033 2018-06-21 02:40:03 whats sick is richard craniums like you screwing someone elses wife. Or getting minors drunk so you can have sex with then. Speaking of white privlage you are a fine example of everything bought for you by the Getty Oil Family. And your wine sucks.
9034 2018-06-21 02:39:54 Again, you don't have to agree w/ it but as long as the trophy revolves around the word "valuable" & not "best" it can be interpreted many different ways. All the good McDavid did & the Oilers were among the worst teams in the NHL. That wasn't the case for the 4 guys ahead of him
9035 2018-06-21 02:39:48 Drugs is not longer their main business, they could get more money from stealing gasoline and oil from the Mexican petroleum state company (Pemex), also immigrants trafficking could give one billion dollars in revenue to the cartels.
9036 2018-06-21 02:39:26 oil spill time
9037 2018-06-21 02:39:14 One major factor has to be considered
frequent fluctuation of oil price is not a healthy practice and prices has to stay constant over a period of time i.e. not less the six months disregarding political instability in within as long as short of supply can be compensated by some
9038 2018-06-21 02:39:14 A new oil change and premium gas my car living his best life
9039 2018-06-21 02:39:13 I pray that this kid gets some cannabis oil, C-60 oil, peach pit extract, apple seed extraxt, juiced turmeric root and black pepper in a carrier oil like coconut oil, and a ketogenic diet high in green vegetables like broccoli and kale because all this stuff cures cancer.

9043 2018-06-21 02:37:51 Mexico is truly an amazing beautiful country! Huge oil reserves mineral deposits second to none, tourist potential unparalleled! God gave Mexico every possible advantage And yet in all their wisdom and intellect have turned it into a backwater undeveloped narco-ruled Third World
9044 2018-06-21 02:37:43 Lougheed built the HF. He is as middle of the road as the current NDP. 
Getty, Klein, Stelmach - they failed. They neglected to continue to invest, even when oil was high. That is poor management.
9045 2018-06-21 02:37:37 Damn oil industry.. They will all fall one day
9046 2018-06-21 02:37:37 Just because US has the largest economy,4 now,doesn’t mean it’s also the one giving the most! Sure shut your purse please and while you are at it,stop stealing oil,natural resources and labour from the same countries u so “generously” r “helping”! see how big and strong u r then
9047 2018-06-21 02:37:34 if someone wants 2 watch 17 episodes of queer eye with me and then blackout and then do it again pls do, my window is unlocked, and my essential oil diffuser is running.
9048 2018-06-21 02:37:18 So many but I can't remember but my son when he was about 6 was on the road with me and saw a Pump Jack on a post card and said Look dad a Pump Jack, another driver asked me if he know what it did and I said tell him, It pumps oil out of the ground dummy

9050 2018-06-21 02:36:42 At the store, shop for smallest asparagus stems you can find.  Drizzle olive oil over your asparagus. Lightly coat them with garlic salt and black pepper. Over indirect heat on a hot grill (350ish) quickly cook about 5-7 minutes (Easier to use a stainless veggie grill pan.)
9051 2018-06-21 02:36:42 Far from it. I have oil paints, pastels, canvas charcoal granite pencils and a bunch more....might have some spider webs or cat hairs though...I’ll happily clean em though.
9052 2018-06-21 02:36:37 Has data really replaced oil as the most valued commodity? #CHMLive

9054 2018-06-21 02:36:06 Do you understand flat tax? Apparently not. 
It also appears you have paid no attention to the investments that have been coming back into AB. 
Funny how Cons can't see past oil and gas.
9055 2018-06-21 02:35:33 Ahhh! Chris has oil, so basically just dilute it?
9056 2018-06-21 02:35:17 I have to get my hands on some rick Simpson oil 
9057 2018-06-21 02:35:11 I did that once when I made pizza with the lemon-infused olive oil instead of regular

9060 2018-06-21 02:34:52 Blue agave in my oil diffuser just gives me life! 
9061 2018-06-21 02:34:42 And add the pressures of climate change.  This may not (yet) be affecting the migrations within the Americas, but there is little doubt African & Middle Eastern drought + conflicts are closely related to climate.  Yet big oil continues to resist taking measures on carbon!
9062 2018-06-21 02:34:40 kalo di aku sib bio oil hehee
9063 2018-06-21 02:34:33 add flavor! like some motor oil or something.
9064 2018-06-21 02:34:12 Sorry to announce that Bella Nonna’s Olive Oil and Vinegars are leaving us. If you need any Olive oils or Vinegars, Thursday, Friday and Saturday, will be your last chance to fill up your cabinets.
9065 2018-06-21 02:34:05 While your Big Oil overlords are exploring underground perhaps they can find the bar you set for this awful excuse for a president you enable.

9073 2018-06-21 02:32:26 Wow!!! This is impressive it only took what, decades of rigging the economy for the rich, almost 20 years of war for oil in the Middle East, and illegal murder/torture all over the world for you to "Renounce" the Republican Party.
9074 2018-06-21 02:32:23 For every oil produced you need the infra to send to consumers. Hope we have it in 2019 !

9117 2018-06-21 02:25:10 Sounds familiar. @heavenlyhounds1 makes some biscuits that help. Heard CBD oil does wonders.
9118 2018-06-21 02:25:00 You can go back home. Just know that same oil contracted was sold to America and other counties for more profit. The Government of Guyana is just has crooked as ours here. Don’t get me started on gold.

So you tell me who is the underdog! 1.6b Muslims/oil money/over 50 majority countries of Muslims! A miracle Israel is still here!
9123 2018-06-21 02:24:45 Because his team was garbage. Like it or not, team success matters. The Lindsay Award has essentially become the award that goes to the best player & McDavid will win it year in and year out.

9130 2018-06-21 02:24:00 Yeah, pretty far fetched for the Oil.....unless the Flyers want the beast Lucic......
9131 2018-06-21 02:23:59 Magdalena river Columbia.
Ecopetrol a state owned Columbian oil company is plagued by oil spills most likely due to poor maintenance systems.
Try telling the whole story. Canadian environmental sustainability programs are far superior to that of Columbia!
9132 2018-06-21 02:23:48 I usually use the Freeman Apple Cider and Vinegar mask and their charcoal mud mask. I also use tea tree oil as spot treatment if I break out. And I moisturize with body shop’s aloe face cream
9133 2018-06-21 02:23:42 I just got snapped on for “wasting oil” 
9134 2018-06-21 02:23:38 Going to watch the baby oil videos
9135 2018-06-21 02:23:24 Every media outlet needs to stay on top of this story, it’s not over. In the meantime he’s signing EOs to reorganize the gov’t and allow oil drilling in more waterways. So much evil all at once.

9138 2018-06-21 02:23:07 Oh no...don't ! 

Seriously, though, I never detected an odor, good or bad from fish and chips...unless the oil is old, perhaps? Blech.
9139 2018-06-21 02:23:07 How many times do y’all use oil before throwing it away? Me... once or twice.
9140 2018-06-21 02:22:59 Your ban? Your Senate record doesn't show any legislation having to do with oil drilling being introduced by you and passed by the Senate. Would you care to elaborate on what you're talking about?
9141 2018-06-21 02:22:47 The one that was cooked in oil. Hahaha
9142 2018-06-21 02:22:41 Fair reason to leave. I left because of the GOP's blind love of Israel.
What Democrat, though, aside from maybe Sanders, has worked to stop these "wars based on oil"?
9143 2018-06-21 02:22:26 Putin is holding him back
9144 2018-06-21 02:22:21 I would pick up avocado oil and use it after you moisturize your hair. Also, whenever you use castor oil, mix it with the avocado to thin it out.
9145 2018-06-21 02:22:15 Oil exports have to crater, right?

9161 2018-06-21 02:20:04 That’s because of high real estate costs, not a bad economy . California has a lower unemployment rate than Texas, the average wage is higher in California, and California’s economy grew at 2.9% in 2016, Texas at 0.4. Oil went bust

9164 2018-06-21 02:19:33 Thrilled about it.  Something tells me that styrofoam reacting with hot cooking oil isn’t nutrient rich.
9165 2018-06-21 02:19:27 Is it true?
Are the other networks ignoring hits rally?
I don't want to check but I sure hope they are finally learning to ignore his one man snake oil salesman shows!
9166 2018-06-21 02:19:26 Hello @alex_export How are you? Are you in crude oil business?
9167 2018-06-21 02:19:11 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?
9168 2018-06-21 02:19:00 อันนี้พูดในรายการอะไรหรอคะ
9169 2018-06-21 02:18:43 Rub coconut oil in it and call it an almond joy
9170 2018-06-21 02:18:39 It clearly is a tool of politics. It always will be until we don’t need oil.
Who writes this puerile dross?
9171 2018-06-21 02:18:31 He is a liar. A convenience man. Snake oil salesman. His propaganda/state media type press conference which was a disingenuous Executive Order & a bunch of his sycophants kissing his butt. It was embarrassing & a slap in the face to those he has injured by his regime's policies.
9172 2018-06-21 02:18:27 It's about 1000 km round-trip from 108 Mile Ranch to Burnaby. That's an awful long way for "grandma" to ride her bicycle, isn't it? 

Yeah, she hates oil -- though, apparently not enough to ever stop using it.  Best part: It all came from the Trans Mountain pipeline. 
9173 2018-06-21 02:18:23 I don't debate with Gobarmints only slap them. Bcz that is how they learn. Go and sell your snake oil somewhere.
9174 2018-06-21 02:18:21 Hopefully the plane is heading south of the border.
9175 2018-06-21 02:18:15 At first I was like "maybe it like separated because lol Texas but it smelling like motor oil instead of margarita was the true nope.
9176 2018-06-21 02:18:15 What's this? Olive trees in the backyard, oil paintings on the wall, bathing in coconut oil, and an oil factory making baby oil, made from real babies.
9177 2018-06-21 02:17:51 Pistachios have a very strong oil, just like my body
9178 2018-06-21 02:17:47 When you think about it.... it got to or niggas would really have pole burns on a regular cause ain’t no oil gonna be safe on the bitch for all that spinning and good grip.

Father was cooking and left the oil in the frying pan to heat as he went off to god knows where. Grease fire ensued and our entire place engulfed in smoke.

Realized things were awry when I heard a shouting outside. Looked out...

9192 2018-06-21 02:15:50 It happened to my just-post-college roommate! She was screaming! ER did the mineral oil thing & we all slept w/ cotton balls in our ears for like 6 weeks. I was going to post this on askme but it seemed too late. So, uh, thank you for the chance to share my antique trauma.

9215 2018-06-21 02:12:51 Just had a weird thought: Aren't planes technically already flying cars? 
Both have:
tires, a steering wheel, can seat more than one occupant, a pilot/co-pilot, can be driven alone, use gas and oil like a car, and both can reach pretty high speeds given the proper mechanics...
9216 2018-06-21 02:12:42 I usually oil it post-wash and then retwist. I been meaning to look into your products too
9217 2018-06-21 02:12:41 Then drink a glass of water with crude oil in it. Personally? Better safe than sorry. Tourism and the fishing industry make up for the potentially damaging-

Oh fuck it. Do what you want. I don't care anymore. Let the world burn for a dollar.

9220 2018-06-21 02:12:36 For sure. Toppings are important. I used to do a lot of dressings. But now I like just oil and red wine vinegar.. or balsamic.
9221 2018-06-21 02:12:31 My nightly routine consists of drowning my body in coconut oil and hoping it will solve all of my problems
9222 2018-06-21 02:12:27 Same here. My workout expanded today and I am beat, or I would burn the midnight oil on this.
9223 2018-06-21 02:12:24 The follow pattern is that of a recent bot account. And apparently, it's been spouting bullshit on military draft (I guess on how men can get drafted and not women), then putting stupid oil on the haustalk debate. First time I see one which delete all tweets as it goes though.
9224 2018-06-21 02:12:24 Yes!  This is true. Did you use lemon verbena as well?  It took a full 24 hours AFTER castor oil/lemon for Zoe to be born.
9225 2018-06-21 02:12:23 Snake oil salesman....
9226 2018-06-21 02:12:20 They aren’t fighting them anyhow. The cartels have killed 113 political candidates since September. On TV, in broad daylight....all anti-corruption candidates.
9227 2018-06-21 02:12:19 Btw, do you really use CBD oil? I’m asking because I’ve had numerous patients telling me they are using for a variety of health issues, especially autoimmune disorders & having great results! It’s exciting time for use of CBD & THC oils
9228 2018-06-21 02:12:12 That is so true! Water is more precious than oil, natural gas, and GOLD!
9229 2018-06-21 02:11:46 Apple cider vinegar! I forgot about that.  That and Coconut oil can save lives.

9238 2018-06-21 02:09:53 Ingesting usually means the oil will take longer to take effect but it's effects will persist for longer, useful in chronic pain for example. Inhalation will cause a faster onset, but won't persist, useful for anxiety or needing to fall asleep, or nausea

9248 2018-06-21 02:07:50 FUCK I USED ALL THE LAVENDER OIL
9249 2018-06-21 02:07:48 I ended up getting an oil change (synthetic oil), air filters changed, and a tire rotation for $140. Girl I got bamboozled, hoodwinked & scammed this is why i need my dad to be with me. And i def got an email from Honda a few weeks ago
9250 2018-06-21 02:07:45 It being an oil doesn't mean you can't inhale it. You can vaporize the oils and inhale them, or you can consume them. The route you use will be determined by the desired effect
9251 2018-06-21 02:07:32 Churchills father, who later became infected with syphilis, gave a speech in Commons around 1870s about the nature of the British Empire. It was all good, of course, 'the oil which rests upon the roiling ocean of the natives, to calm them and bring order' or something like that.
9252 2018-06-21 02:07:31 Yeah I found several people with bud through Instagram but not a single person with oil 
9253 2018-06-21 02:07:05 Ok, let’s end Medicare! Got any old ppl in your life? Let’s give all our money to US corporations. After all, we give them $800 buck , while we give the poor $36. Corporate welfare! Oil welfare! Farming welfare!

9256 2018-06-21 02:06:19 Liquid is better than powder. I usually use Coffeemate Hazelnut but French Vanilla is pretty good as well. ID also is okay but it's usually a little higher. They all taste like they have vegetable oil as a main ingredient, which they do. Kinda yuck.
9257 2018-06-21 02:06:06 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.

9260 2018-06-21 02:05:40 Than the whole plant simply due to reliability of dosing and focussing on the benefits you are aiming for. It is likely that in the body, all these ingredients combined will have a different effect than each one would as an isolated oil.

Is it due to concentration?

9279 2018-06-21 02:03:21 It absolutely can be used as a weapon.  Without energy, particularly oil, even today, nothing can be accomplished.  That’s why Henry Kissinger once said, “control the oil, and you control nations.”  Why do you think oil has been priced in US dollars all these years?

9286 2018-06-21 02:02:09 Not all countries have it together enough to protect their people. It's up to the ones who can to help the others. It also doesn't help that countries like the US exploit the hell out of some of them for oil and gas and minerals.

9290 2018-06-21 02:01:13 2018 : the year I started wearing palo santo oil and carrying three different healing crystals in my pocket every day
9291 2018-06-21 02:01:06 The government of New Zealand has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Isla Fisher in a scrim wig.
9292 2018-06-21 02:00:58 The most successful people I know:
1. Slice cucumber
2. Cube feta
3. Slice red onions
4. Chop romaine lettuce
5. Add kalamata olives
6. Combine all ingredients in a bowl and dress with olive oil and lemon
7. Eat at every single meal
9293 2018-06-21 02:00:54 I like to eat mines with shrimp and i use olive oil for as sauce.
9294 2018-06-21 02:00:52 อย่าพึ่ง ~~~ รอแอดมินคอนเฟิร์มข้อมูลก่อนนะครับ เร็วๆ นี้ :)
9295 2018-06-21 02:00:52 だめだ、珍しく他の人の声が頭に残ってやがる。Arkさんのオーキド博士の残り方が、ヤバすぎるww
9296 2018-06-21 02:00:22 I didn’t take it there for an oil change though. I took it because it needed brakes & while the guy at the shop was driving it into the service lane, he saw the mileage thing on my window & realized I’m about 20,000 past when I needed to get my oil changed.
9297 2018-06-21 02:00:20 Saudi Arabia pushing plan to raise OPEC+ oil production by ~600k bpd - delegates familiar said, in attempt to bridge differences between Iran and Russia. Iran oil min said "optimistic" about Fri's outcome
Oil (-/=), KSA Tadawul (=/-)
9298 2018-06-21 02:00:17 The threshing floors are full of grain;the vats overflow with fresh wine and olive oil.  Joel 2:24
9299 2018-06-21 02:00:12 Petroleum, or crude oil, forms when tiny little sea animals and plants die and then get mixed up with sand and slit on the sea floors.
9300 2018-06-21 02:00:01 You mean like Astroglide, condoms,  and a bottle of Cod liver oil?
9301 2018-06-21 01:59:53 I've experienced plenty of variety in life and nothing comes close to Harry Styles and the enjoyment thereof. Well, the aroma of a well-aged calamus essential oil comes fairly close. 
And my tweet was actually part of a quote from The Man from Snowy River. 
9302 2018-06-21 01:59:49 This has nothing to do with oil & gas! If you clam 2 cover that industry. Stay focused on the facts & eliminate your partisan rhetoric! #FamiliesBelongTogether

9305 2018-06-21 01:59:23 I speak only for myself.  I do not take responsibility for how other people state their opinions.  I try to respond to the issue and not the personality, believing your character and that of others is between you and God.  I find Rush Limbaugh astute.  He cites resources for ever
9306 2018-06-21 01:59:10 stop everyone keeps telling me thats the worse thing to do. Im just using tea tree oil in hopes it goes away
9307 2018-06-21 01:59:05 Gel? Pomade? Or oil?
9308 2018-06-21 01:58:50 Let me get thee coconut oil
9309 2018-06-21 01:58:47 Did you clean up all the oil spills yet?
9310 2018-06-21 01:58:05 Pure Snake Oil!
9311 2018-06-21 01:57:20 Use some cuticle oil...or Aquaphor
9312 2018-06-21 01:57:15 I never had dressing in my life i dont like how they smell so all my salads have lemon and olive oil only and im not putting that on fruit LMAO

9316 2018-06-21 01:56:52 It literally hurts my SOUL that after months I’m still out of the amazingly wonderful, awesome & my skins saving grace @tartecosmetics Maracuja Oil! Such a bummer & I can tell the difference in my skin  #HelpMeTarte #CollegeKidBudgetProblems
9317 2018-06-21 01:56:50 Ah,  ok... I heard that name before. Probably in some sort of oil I use... Lol.  They are pretty 
9318 2018-06-21 01:56:38 Serious question
The Northern Gateway pipeline was fully approved through an exhaustive process. The Libs cancelled it strictly for political purposes. If Cons get back in can they proceed with pipeline without any further steps (besides cancelling the anti-AB oil tanker ban)?
9319 2018-06-21 01:56:05 How we gonna be signing players during world cup szn when noone's paying attention. I need rival fans calling us Oil Money F.C to keep me going
9320 2018-06-21 01:56:02 Yeen sad shit slick to a can of oil
9321 2018-06-21 01:55:49 SERIOUSLY ?   Why did you post this @boicepr ?  It makes no sense to me....since your hero Rush Limbaugh is the biggest piece of uncivil, hate filled, bag of hot air I have ever come across.  :)
9322 2018-06-21 01:55:44 unseemly yes, but the Trudeau gov't is guilty of many bigger sins than an opulent swing set.  Perhaps ask him why the $cdn has fallen steadily to about $0.75/USD today, even with oil prices in the mid $60's/barrel
9323 2018-06-21 01:55:31 About to take an essential oil bath with a glass of wine I am truly living my best life
9324 2018-06-21 01:55:30 I wonder how many of them are members of MS-13 
9325 2018-06-21 01:55:24 Republicans died when George W. Bush started two wars without an exit strategy & destabilized the Middle East just to increase oil prices, so he and his oil company could make more money. Then he cut taxes & spending. This & doubling gas prices started the Great Recession.
9326 2018-06-21 01:55:23 いかん、ふつおた
9327 2018-06-21 01:55:12 We've been at war in Afghanistan for 17 years only b/c of an oil pipeline route, so why not   
9328 2018-06-21 01:55:04 Getting ready to hit the road this summer? Make sure you’re heading out with an oil change and other updated maintenance so we don’t have to send a tow-truck out after ya! Make your appointment today.
9329 2018-06-21 01:55:01 @ Philippine Natural Oil Company, Bataan.
9330 2018-06-21 01:54:57 Yep
9331 2018-06-21 01:54:56 You def need a new shower head. But using a surfactant based shampoo will remove build up and soften your hair which will help bring back moisture. Utilize a humectant based moisturizer. And use oils like almond, argan and jojoba oil to seal moisture.
9332 2018-06-21 01:54:47 Yes that is a great parable and we're always asking the Lord to give us more oil because we really need it God bless you
9333 2018-06-21 01:54:27 Well since 12 after getting my oil changed.
9334 2018-06-21 01:54:23 so lol my hair. i decided to bleach it with this coconut oil bleach shit thinking it’d be less damaging i was wrong. wrong as a bitch. wrong as a mf.
9335 2018-06-21 01:54:16 Hi Brad - could you share the individual countries classified as oil importers running deficits/surpluses and oil exporters in your insightful graph? Thanks!
9336 2018-06-21 01:54:06 Gold? Oil? That’s propaganda to provoke protectionism attitude of local warlords.

9339 2018-06-21 01:53:52 My essential oil tutorial is this: if you’re poopin before bae come over, toss a few drops in the toilet after, they will never know

9341 2018-06-21 01:53:02 It looks like an OIL SLICK and someone ran their finger thru it.
9342 2018-06-21 01:52:55 Double down. Get that beard growth oil. Rub on your pits. Braid them
9343 2018-06-21 01:52:48 a tip for all my gfs that get razor rash; leaving shaving til the end of your shower/bath so your pores are open & hair is soft, then shave w olive oil!!! it leaves no bumps or rash!!!!!!
9344 2018-06-21 01:52:48 Someone gave me a bottle 1/4 full of toofaced to try. As soon as I got it box clearly says coconut oil a d this girl knows I'm allergic. So just threw it away.
9345 2018-06-21 01:52:41 Time for a oil check up

9356 2018-06-21 01:50:15 flipping houses is the white collar crime equivalent of overcharging for an oil change
9357 2018-06-21 01:50:14 Too much oil in a plate
9358 2018-06-21 01:50:02 Bike vs Car:
Picked up bike from Local Bike Shop. They corrected bent derailleur hanger, adjusted cables, overhauled head set. Less than US $25. Oil change for Subaru: $104. Damned money sucking machine! Viva the bike!
9359 2018-06-21 01:49:59 Got so baked one time that I mistook my beard oil for vape juice... Needless to say I puffed on that shit for about 15 minutes before I felt my esophagus growing a 5 o’clock shadow.

9361 2018-06-21 01:49:46 The last thing the oil need is more truculence...which is always slower than McJesus

9365 2018-06-21 01:49:17 油を英訳すると、なんて言うか知ってるかい?
9366 2018-06-21 01:48:58 I think it’s because this ver is in black&white, so they put the oil on his skin to make sure we still see him glowing? 
9367 2018-06-21 01:48:16 Not quite. Science says phase out fossil fuels, not expand the oil sands and buy & build pipelines. Politics apparently says otherwise.
9368 2018-06-21 01:47:28 My 6 step skincare routine: 
1) oil based cleanser pacifica
2) water based mask pacifica 
3) clay mask

5) 928 oz. of water every 2 hours. 
6) Korean rose petal sheet mask
9369 2018-06-21 01:47:26 Throwback to when I had my Durango and I didn’t get my oil changed for 2 years because i forgot

9372 2018-06-21 01:47:21 Babies in cages, oil spills, alienation from the free world, gas prices  higher than we've seen in 10 years... all in just one year.  Oh but Kim Jung Un loves us and so does Putin.  Be proud be very very proud
9373 2018-06-21 01:47:21 I got you on da cornrows friend. And just use a little water and oil
9374 2018-06-21 01:47:16 Finally copped the oil diffuser and it’s heavenly bruh... heavenly
9375 2018-06-21 01:47:07 Cuticle oil is the fucking best
9376 2018-06-21 01:46:57 If you’re viable and the pubic wants your product, you don’t need subsidies. Take tax breaks away and oil still flourishes. Take cash handouts away, and renewables suffer greatly
9377 2018-06-21 01:46:55 @WhiteHouse My Preference Is Surface Mining. Clearing The Top Layers Of Ground. To Access The Oil Sands. This Technology Would Recover 100%.

 Dark Young of Shub-Niggurath Urban Collection 71pts
9381 2018-06-21 01:46:22 It’s a shuffling of the deck.  As MARAD CC, I detailed lawyers to Coast Guard after Deepwater Oil spill. It gave CG lawyers opportunity to focus on the spill while MARAD lawyers did back office work.  DOJ is trying to do same maneuver here.
9382 2018-06-21 01:46:10 I know parents afraid to dose their kids with CBD oil for ADHD, ADD or depression.  Parents, of all people!  They shouldn't require permission or be afraid of CPS.  Don't say use isolate... I know it's an option for no THC, but it's not often the best option.
9383 2018-06-21 01:46:00 The names of the drug Lords, gun fights between the cartels, kidnap cases of  mexican civilians, politicians Nexus with drug cartels, how the cartels diversified their business and covered immigrants smuggling, how the cartel stole gasoline, gas and oil from Pemex, etc etc.

9385 2018-06-21 01:45:47 A nice hot bath and then lavendar oil aromatherapy.

9400 2018-06-21 01:44:16 รกดีอย่างงี้ชอบๆ
9401 2018-06-21 01:44:08 Oregano oil is a godsend!  Works best if you take it when you feel yourself getting sick 
9402 2018-06-21 01:44:04 This effort was led by Standard Oil & other petroleum Co.s
9403 2018-06-21 01:44:00 When they found some tiny off the wall sites on the internet that were financed by oil money (It was easy to check things like that back then), it all came apart. I couldn't get through to them anymore. Today they spout things like "globalist" with the rest of the lost souls.

9406 2018-06-21 01:43:40 Spray them with cooking oil emulsified in water and the oil will suffocate the tics.  Been working great this year. Drawback is oily dogs

9408 2018-06-21 01:43:28 Everyone’s seen that post saying that our universe is probably just a shitty project some alien got a C- on. But like, I want to meet the Bitch that got an A. Like what he do? Make cars run on water instead of oil? Or just ignore the whole human species, Or just earth in general?
9409 2018-06-21 01:43:20 My favorite part of cooking is when you accidentally fling hot oil on your hand. My thumb hurts
9410 2018-06-21 01:43:19 No Juan, you’re wrong.

The right doesn’t “ Delight“ in Peter Fonda’s disgusting tweets.

However, The left does.

It’s confirmation of how much non-consequential degeneracy they’re allowed.
9411 2018-06-21 01:43:16 how do ppl like oil in their salad.... like quit pretending you enjoy eating greasy leaves we all see through u
9412 2018-06-21 01:43:03 happy international women's day, covered in boiling oil
9413 2018-06-21 01:43:01 Nuxe oil - smells great too ;-)
9414 2018-06-21 01:42:49 Wanna know something that will really make you feel like an idiot? Taking your car to the shop to get fixed & realizing you haven’t had your oil changed since you bought the car a year & a half ago. Yeah I did that. I’m an idiot. 
9415 2018-06-21 01:42:43 利用者さんと朝ごはん食べてから無事帰宅
9416 2018-06-21 01:42:31 Did you know you can clean your face with oil? Mirah Cleansing Oil. Mirah Luminous Hair Oil, good for all hair types. Thank goodness for these. I hate my frizzy hair.
9417 2018-06-21 01:42:30 Yay it’s face mask and castor oil treatment day.  have never been one to be into things like this, but I’m enjoying the changes I’ve been making. 
9418 2018-06-21 01:42:19 I have friends needing, really needing, CBD oil for a chance at a productive, pain-free life.  They can't even try it even though it's legal to buy.  Too many drug tests show positive for THC, no matter how scant and these are ex-cons on parole.  Make it legal for everyone!
9419 2018-06-21 01:42:13 All roads lead to Guyana now! Imagine how some haughty Bajans used to diss the Guyanese? And look deh now, reverse migration is likely now with this oil bounty!! Demerara rum on the house now!
9420 2018-06-21 01:42:00 If that was so the government would not be handing renewables cash even though they pay in comparison little to no taxes compared to oil
9421 2018-06-21 01:41:41 These fuckers don't know what an oil change or fluid flush is down here hella cars be blowin their engines out shit funny as fuck
9422 2018-06-21 01:41:18 The time I thought fish oil was okay to take even tho I’m allergic to fish was a doosy.
9423 2018-06-21 01:41:10 But if you that costs a little extra cooking oil.
9424 2018-06-21 01:41:06 oil pan, youre done. oh im about to take a sloppy sloppy oil shower

9433 2018-06-21 01:40:12 So my car is starting to burn oil...I think it's my PCV valve which is cheaper but still costly and also may  not be the source of the problem. To top it off my my clutch is going out. Fixing all this is a lot of $$ and my mind is a mess thinking on what I should do. The car
9434 2018-06-21 01:40:12 Try using a light oil after u put ur moisturizer on jojoba or avocado. Scalp massages are good for stimulating hair growth and using a silk pillow case/bonnet to protect ur ends so u can retain length
9435 2018-06-21 01:40:11 Makes sense, riper foods are sweeter. Something something starches being broken down something?
I mostly use it to cut down on butter/oil in baking. Or if I don't have enough eggs.

9440 2018-06-21 01:39:49 Cooking is fun. Didn’t have any sauce for my pasta… So I just started throwing shit in the water while it was boiling. Garlic salt, minced garlic, ground pepper, cayenne, fancy pink salt, butter and olive oil...dis shit pretty good.

9442 2018-06-21 01:39:41 Y'all thought I was joking  realistically I use crying, aloe vera gel, witch hazel, crying, vitamin e oil, crying, and sun screen with at least 50 spf 
9443 2018-06-21 01:39:29 Its because you and I think in 2 dimensions, while the God Emperor thinks in 42D and has actually been to the future. He knows what we need. 

The future is coal mines and whale oil lamps.
9444 2018-06-21 01:39:25 Because oil is a massive industry that has lobbied on a massive scale to prevent renewables from making them obsolete.
9445 2018-06-21 01:39:07 Because if you can’t see the chains tell me what use is a key, it’s cash, blood and oil, in the age of the refugee, they’re trying to buy our minds, we ain’t selling, bang, bang, bang, hear they’re nailing down the coffins #parkwaydrive

9447 2018-06-21 01:38:37 Why wouldn’t Trump appeal to @SenJohnHoeven ??? ....  #ND has  #Bakken oil fields.
9448 2018-06-21 01:38:30 That's what they are selling but they are calling it compassion. As for things U can agree too forget it. They're rational, reasonable & respect our laws but that is not enough. If @Gop give an inch @Thedemocrats will demand that & the snake oil of open borders called compassion

9456 2018-06-21 01:37:07 Ok i showered, moisturized my body, used my new mask, did my skincare routine, sprayed lavender oil on my pillow and tucked myself in bed. WHY AM I NOT SLEEPING YET????
9457 2018-06-21 01:36:47 Because, my lovely lady, they have all the oil and all the money and they are "more than a little bit crazy" 
In my book, like yours, not valid reasons.
9458 2018-06-21 01:36:46 I never used it ask a mask but I put it on after I wash/exfoliate n it really feels like a tightening moisturizer then I put a Lil oil on top to give a Lil glow

9464 2018-06-21 01:35:22 Extra Virgin Olive Oil. 

The best condition for using it is when it is uncooked, front & center for taste (e.g. salad, drizzle finish, etc). 

In most other cases, less expensive olive oil is fine.
9465 2018-06-21 01:35:02 The capitalist billionaire siphon off the world's oil into their tankers, while millions have to burn manure for heat.

9468 2018-06-21 01:34:39 Canola oil is not healthy.
9469 2018-06-21 01:34:27 Trump is a disgrace and an idiot. Even if he doesn't believe in climate change, anyone with an ounce of intelligence can understand the damage pollution - whether oil spills or plastics - does to the oceans and marine wildlife.

9480 2018-06-21 01:33:14 Why do people try to suggest that she is anything other than what her father is?  Trump is a euphemism for snake oil salesman and she sells it just like her father.
9481 2018-06-21 01:33:06 I know we have oil imports but believe that happens because of our refinery capacity and because the final products are destined for export not consumption.
9482 2018-06-21 01:32:53 I had a whole humongous jar of coconut oil in my car. The problem is that the lid came off. The second problem is that it fell over after I violently stopped at a red light. The final problem is that there is coconut oil all over the floor of my car.
9483 2018-06-21 01:32:50 Total BS. Renewables are being handed cash to remain viable-which is what a subsidy is. Oil is viable, pays taxes, and is given tax breaks like thousands of other industries

I work in the oil and gas industry, and I know for a fact there are certain ways to do things. So you don't people get hurt, having the hubris to speak out, with authority, to prevent and or stop loss of life, is not a bad thing

9564 2018-06-21 01:18:48 I have been told alcohol burns cooler than gasoline. It reduces durability of fuel systems because of water accumulation. It made sense in 1972 with no oil tankers heading toward America and America possessing only 40% of the oil we needed. Now? We are self-sufficient in oil.

9568 2018-06-21 01:18:34 This has to be one of the most outrageous, blasphemous things I’ve read on Twitter today...Doctor, you desperately need a doctor. This is not factual and you should have your licensed revoked for peddling this snake oil.
9569 2018-06-21 01:18:32 Um Fuck you for the Texas thing.  That would be Arkansas.   Texas stereotype is desert, oil, and horses downtown all with cowboy hats.   None of which are true at the same time.

9597 2018-06-21 01:14:53 I remember this well from more than a half-century ago. As I recall, it was actually pumping some oil then for demonstration.
9598 2018-06-21 01:14:50 Also, the US provoked these so called extremists with their US foreign policies with their support of Israel, starting a mass genocide of the indigenous Palestinians, and invading the Middle East in search of oil and other natural resources, copying and pasting democracy w/o

9600 2018-06-21 01:14:40 Correction-Oil is being given preferential treatment for drilling, is being given additional tax breaks, and renewables are having additional tariffs. Oil is being given preferential treatment-deliberately so.

Were these spent to spread prosperity & American values? Or, use terror as a decoy to destroy states into chaeos to advance Israel’s agenda, & get the oil?

9617 2018-06-21 01:11:20 1. Dinner tonight. Grilled fish tacos with grilled fajita vegetables and grilled avocado. Yes, grilled avocado. Cut the avocado in half and remove the pit. Leave in the shell. Coat the flesh side with olive oil and grill flesh-side down in a grill pan.
9618 2018-06-21 01:11:00 Hahha. I didn't want money, just food. And Hi-Tec may be shit now but used to make Cadillacs for your feet. Don't even get me started on my IDF gear. After 13 months we we running out of clothes and once it started raining oil no one gave one fuck about anything.
9619 2018-06-21 01:10:34 Yes girl!! Get some healthy fats in there too!! Oil, avocado, nuts etc... it will help!!
9620 2018-06-21 01:10:33 I was kind of upset with your original text about Antoni because I think he’s pretty entertaining. But then he promoted truffle oil and (thanks to Bourdain) I was immediately upset with him and I reread your column. You made good points.

Sadface for back home atm.
9623 2018-06-21 01:10:23 every man i’ve ever known has told me “you should learn how to change your brakes, change your oil, or do literally anything on your car by yourself.” but refuses to show me hands on.

9627 2018-06-21 01:09:52 Oil is hardly subsidized, it’s given tax breaks like thousands of other industries. Renewables are given subsides. Tax breaks aren’t subsidies-look up the definition

This includes massive amounts of residential drilling with massive well pads topping nearly 56 wells. #BanFracking

9637 2018-06-21 01:08:10 I'm sure if you pinch your nose its just like taking castor oil.

9640 2018-06-21 01:07:27 My mom says the same exact thing. She also has a similar line about anything a doctor says. I’m pretty sure she’s convinced that raw honey and coconut oil will cure anything.
9641 2018-06-21 01:06:58 I don’t trust people who go to festivals n buy all their meals there it’s so pricey and there’s something iconic about drunkenly boiling water for pot noodle or using strongbow to fry sausages because you have no oil

9645 2018-06-21 01:06:47 1/ Elon Musk seems to live in a reality distortion bubble now.  Martin Tripp seems to be a process technician who leaked info the process.  Probably not a hacker.  But Musk wants to believe that hackers like Tripp, short sellers, and big oil are out to destroy Tesla.

Comes out so tender and flaky so that it’s really easy for him to eat! And then I did a side of sautéed zucchini and he devoured that too!  so yummy

9654 2018-06-21 01:04:44 "I want to make sure you're eating enough fats to stay full." Say no more, fam. Sometimes you just need a big-ass bowl of pasta with olive oil, butter, and graded cheese. For the macros.
9655 2018-06-21 01:04:40 Tulsi,

Tell Congress if they really want to cut illegal immigration, they need to stop supporting & fomenting coups against gov'ts in other countries that try to raise wages or fight  plantation, sweatshop, mining, & oil companies to get a better deal for their people.
9656 2018-06-21 01:04:20 That 50% number is BS. Which billions to which countries? And the Alberta oil industry tanked before Trudeau even took office, mostly due to global oil prices crashing.

9659 2018-06-21 01:04:02 I invite you to Tamaulipas to report on the cartels operations (drug trafficking, immigrants trafficking, stolen gasoline, gas and oil from Pemex, illegal fishing in Texas and Mexico, kidnap of tamaulipecos, extortion etc etc). We the tamaulipecos are alone against this cartels.
9660 2018-06-21 01:03:54 That was the plan all along the tax cuts to boost an already strong economy was so much snake oil sold to the public. Oh and it didn’t hurt them that those that benefit most from the tax cuts are their wealthy donors.

- all of lushes products are vegan. And they don’t test on animals. Having incredibly sensitive skin myself,  there masks do no damages.  

- Aveeno. 
- all of Aveeno’s products are hypoallergenic and oil free. 
You can get it at a drug store.

9679 2018-06-21 01:00:47 I thought energy independence made it so that we weren't beholden to OPEC/Venezuela and production cuts. Where is our oil going? Is it being refined for national consumption or being sold overseas and thereby supplementing the shortage caused by the aforementioned cuts???

Life is brazy.
9687 2018-06-21 00:59:15 But the world will be “off” dilbit first long before conventional oil runs out. Are you sure this pipeline will even pay for itself?
9688 2018-06-21 00:59:00 if all cars were electric as we all know they can be, oil price would crumble and so would pollution. When will this happen? NEVER!
9689 2018-06-21 00:58:59 I got my dad to try taking CBD oil for his anxiety a few months ago, and he just dropped $600 on more oil lol

9702 2018-06-21 00:57:34 True.  But, as far as a business standpoint Oklahoma is very lucrative because of the oil connections and big money that follows that.

9718 2018-06-21 00:55:41 The coconut oil on the counter has gone from solid to liquid.  Now is the time to be panicking, we need a resolution to this whole "global warming" nuisance.

9738 2018-06-21 00:53:09 The chimney cleaning did not go according to plan. Apparently the previous house owner didn't line the chimney properly when they installed the oil heater. We've been told this is a potential fire hazard and not up to code. Well spoot.
9739 2018-06-21 00:53:09 Biggest thing to me is to diversify our economy. Especially with the solar potential we have in the province. But nope, oil and gas forever and ever. I work in the industry, but the writing is there to be seen.

9753 2018-06-21 00:51:44 Lemon essential oil ... removes any glues. But don’t go in the sun after using it. Photosensitivity will burn the skin.
9754 2018-06-21 00:51:42 Lemon chicken. Cutlets. Seasoned. Dusted in flour. Sautéed in butter and/ or olive oil. Add white wine and Lemmon juice. Thinly sliced lemons. Reduce. Amazing. Serve on angel hair or with asparagus. LMK how it goes. Xoxo
9755 2018-06-21 00:51:37 The United States will be the world's top oil producer in just a matter of months. US production exected to surpass 11 million barrels a day within the next three to four months
9756 2018-06-21 00:51:28 If you think it’s only going to cost the average family $110 a year you’re a moron. That person would have to not drive, not heat or AC their house, not buy food, not buy anything made with oil...basically that family would have to become hermits!
9757 2018-06-21 00:51:16 Agree with the acid need. I like to brush on a lemon chili oil after the pizza is cooked. Fresh squeezed grapefruit juice and peppercorns is nice with a pizza where you use goat cheese.
9758 2018-06-21 00:51:16 Because oil profits dried up literally overnight. Money had to come from somewhere.

9770 2018-06-21 00:49:29 Faso is a total coward and beholden to Mercer and the oil lobby.
9771 2018-06-21 00:49:19 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
9772 2018-06-21 00:49:16 Medical tape has done this. I exfoliateed with oil and a loofah. And also Dr Bonner's.
9773 2018-06-21 00:49:06 My 30min of google research cant find any better options.  My hot take is basically I trust politicians slightly more than I trust giant oil/tobacco/drug companies.  So the WTO model seems slightly better.
9774 2018-06-21 00:48:55 A lot of North Dakota oil people live in the Duluth area
9775 2018-06-21 00:48:50 Same can be said for oil and gas industry.
9776 2018-06-21 00:48:49 I finally got off my butt and got an oil change yesterday. Also changed my TMobile plan to my moms. Saves a good chunk of change.  Now I just gotta get rid of my cable cause soooo not worth it.
9777 2018-06-21 00:48:48 Aye, but we're no giving up the oil, whisky or about 2 million people

9784 2018-06-21 00:47:58 Read: “in 500 days, we’ve cut more protections than any president in history.”

9785 2018-06-21 00:47:50 Good grief! And the Province of Quebec and other eastern Canadian provinces have for decades imported oil from some of these nations rather than use ALBERTA oil. Yet they happily took equalization payments from Alberta!

9787 2018-06-21 00:47:32 Don’t make eggs with vegetable oil. No matter how bad you want eggs. DONT FUCKING DO IT
9788 2018-06-21 00:47:11 Not in their defence, but we were in dire circumstances a couple years ago with oil production shutting down. Maybe now the pipeline is a go, things will be different
9789 2018-06-21 00:47:10 Coconut Oil os everything 
9790 2018-06-21 00:46:58 You mean the same private industry that caused the great depression & recession?  Or oil companies that create environmental catastrophes?  Or maybe the manufacturing companies that moved out of the rust belt & crippled generations of families?  Which ones exactly?
9791 2018-06-21 00:46:57 If you don’t cook with grape seed oil...i don’t want it
9792 2018-06-21 00:46:54 You gotta coconut oil the heck out of them so they can slide off lol
9793 2018-06-21 00:46:50 Coconut oil contains SPF 4...blocking 75% of UV rays.  This means 45 minutes of protection (roughly).  Get that Vitamin D!

9795 2018-06-21 00:46:31 "Thank you for what? " is the correct answer.  Because today's EO is just another bottle of snake oil, a sham, a delaying tactic.  If one reads the order they will find it is completely void of any substance pertaining to the children or the families being torn apart.
9796 2018-06-21 00:46:02 They aren’t depending on consistent funding from government. They got started and they’re doing quite well on their own. Want to talk about what industries started with government money. Let’s talk about the oil sands. That’s called government initiatives inspiring capitalism!
9797 2018-06-21 00:45:34 The only thing stopping you from dumping used motor oil down the storm drain is the law, then?

9806 2018-06-21 00:44:53 It’s almost as if you asked them to inject motor oil into their veins, the way they break down in abject horror.

9830 2018-06-21 00:41:24 Noted! LOL, full disclosure. Its only time I ever used Numbers! was just fooling around. It conveys my main point that 3 companies had almost half of all public lands for solar, which would've been more acreage of public lands used ever by all mining, oil, coal & gas combined.
9831 2018-06-21 00:41:02 It’s feels weird the first few days! But use a really good conditioning mask once a week. Use a heat oil protectant before you use heat on your hair and use leave in condition on your ends and it’ll get your hair back to being super healthy! It’s a process but it works for me!
9832 2018-06-21 00:40:47 In Alberta we have private that will buy the pipeline. When it go out to tender their be companies that will make offers. SouthEast Asia need oil.

9846 2018-06-21 00:38:52 This used to have this happen all the time. It tends to happen more with oily coffees, I've observed. (Oil content usually depends on brewing process more than anything. It's not necessarily a bad thing.)

9852 2018-06-21 00:37:39 Went to work, got my car washed and detailed, oil changed, battery checked, took my siblings to dinner and ice cream, we cleaned the whole house and it’s only 8:30. It’s a good day.

9861 2018-06-21 00:36:25 1/2 RE U.S. #gasoline #demand: Curious about fluctuation, 8.976 million bpd to 9.879 mln to 9.326 mln last 3 weeks. No holidays, no panic buys. Anyone posit a theory on jump, then immediate easing? The 4-week avg had less pronounced rise, retreat same weeks. #OOTT #oil #energy

9863 2018-06-21 00:36:06 Yeah, who needs plastic free oceans, marine life, clean water. Let all the oil companies spill oil in the oceans without regard for a healthy food chain, wildlife, and a clean environment.
9864 2018-06-21 00:36:02 I had a lady today make me look for abt 30 minutes with her going through every brand of olive oil we have looking for one that was “light colored and only from one country” she didn’t care which country but it couldn’t be from two countries.
9865 2018-06-21 00:35:49 What happened in Cuba? No oil by the way. Are they driving all those vintage cars because they are cool?  Crossing 90 miles of treacherous sea because they are in paradise?

9867 2018-06-21 00:35:36 If you're an economist worth your salt, you will understand the implications of such a tremendous increase in crude oil production. 

The US declared economic independence and a new world economic order is being built right before your eyes. Unless you're blind that is.
9868 2018-06-21 00:35:22 My Someone bought me beard oil (even though I don't have that much beard) and I put some on this morning and smell, still, of black spruce & white cedar and I love it.

9872 2018-06-21 00:34:36 Got my brakes done, my oil change done, and my alignment done. The only question now is where the fuck we going this summer?

9877 2018-06-21 00:33:43 I got a set of dough trays yesterday instead of olive oil!
9878 2018-06-21 00:33:38 Crazy to see how much Beto’s business has grown. S/o to all you guys that have oil in your house and not gas
9879 2018-06-21 00:33:28 look into lemon & olive oil (Milk Thistle also helps)

9883 2018-06-21 00:31:44 i’m with you in the olive oil and salt, but would greatly prefer they be used on literally almost ANY other food. to be fair, though, it’s partly because my body cannot process leafy greens, like, at all

9885 2018-06-21 00:31:24 Trying to decide on an oil diffuser any recommendations?
9886 2018-06-21 00:31:23 Why don’t you work on the rules and fines for oil companies spilling oil? The Republican governor and two other dudes get to decide the fines. It’s a terrible system that is “pro-business” but anti-ecosystem, Anti-responsible and anti-conservation.

9890 2018-06-21 00:30:36 Maybe you are asking the wrong question.  What is Canada doing about Climate Change?  Drilling for oil?  Cutting timber?  Burning coal?  Why doesn't Canada invite all the illegal aliens to leave the uncivilized U.S. and join the enlightened Canadians?
9891 2018-06-21 00:30:33 But everyone’s skin is different, some are naturally oily (mine) and sometimes oil is produced based off if diet which is why I stress the dermatologist part bc I am not a professional 
9892 2018-06-21 00:30:27 Interesting, someone discovered oil and we're going to actually sell like the Arabs? Or he's raising GST? Or he's just an idiot.
9893 2018-06-21 00:30:26 The corp/#lpc/#cpc govts partnerships are moving fast now Josh, from 10yr locked in fossilfuel subsidies, to bailing out foreign oil cos, to privatizing all vital, education and public services. We are in big trouble. #cdnpoli #onpoli
9894 2018-06-21 00:30:14 Wow !!!! I could of gotten my oil change for 20 bucks 
9895 2018-06-21 00:29:41 I was never a massive Shriekback fan, I just had (and really liked) that album Oil and Gold. Which I'd like to hear again.
9896 2018-06-21 00:29:39 And if the train derails no one pays any fines. If the oil companies have an issue with a well or a pipeline, no one pays more than 10% of the actual fine. We allow the oil companies to destroy our land and water in the name of “good business policies”. Damn disgrace.
9897 2018-06-21 00:29:39 Yes.  From the Gentle Chef.  1 cup soy milk room temp and 1 cup refined coconut oil emulsified in a blender by slowly pouring oil into blending milk.  Then whipped cold with vanilla and sugar.   do not overwhip.
9898 2018-06-21 00:29:31 Trump’s never were friendly or close to any Europeans. Their alliances have always been Russian, Chinese and Middle East. Now the rest of US are entangled in this hostile geopolitical attempt at world dominance with oil and gas.
9899 2018-06-21 00:29:19 I’ve got a lot of train work to do. Guess I should’ve come home from the golf course earlier.  Midnight oil I will burn!
9900 2018-06-21 00:28:39 J'ai un problème avec leur liste d'ingrédients : pas complète et "grape seed essential oïl, olive essential oïl", ça n'existe pas, ce n'est pas juste. Je suis un peu toutchy parce que fabricante  moi même et la liste des ingrédients doit être réelle.
9901 2018-06-21 00:28:36 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
9902 2018-06-21 00:28:28 I hope there are holes to pour burning oil on visitors you don’t want ;)
9903 2018-06-21 00:28:21 Rosehip oil itu bqgus buag oily beb dia minyak ug bagus untuk kulit berminyak. Tapi makenya pas udah bener bener ga ada jerawat. Gitu. Trilogy bagus. Jangan diragukan lagi.
9904 2018-06-21 00:28:20 Whilst the Tories play command & control politics with peoples lives, grown ups in Canada from Oct 17th can legally: 
- purchase cannabis, cannabis oil, plants and seeds for cultivation
- possess up to 30 grams of cannabis
- cultivate up to four plants at home (per household)
9905 2018-06-21 00:28:06 I'm still pretty frustrated that the PC's were in power for. 40+ years with oil prices as high as they were and we don't have a whole lot to show for it.
9906 2018-06-21 00:27:55 Um yes, a Benzaderm wash (2x/day), I use a lotion (avail anywhere) Aveeno Positively Radiant daily moisurizer, I was also prescribed to these pills and pads that reduce the oil on my face. And like I said routine is what matters.
9907 2018-06-21 00:27:47 I thought the 21st century would be mankind unlocking the scientific secrets of the universe but we're just trying to stop a guy from stealing Mexican kids as a diversion for cutting taxes for his rich buddies and illegally invading countries for their oil ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

9910 2018-06-21 00:26:53 Really? Technically, olive oil isn't paleo either.

Lentils are prolly one of the better plant-based foods you can consume (esp if fermented cuz they're basically pre-digested). I prefer lentils to beans. I think beans are gross anyways.
9911 2018-06-21 00:26:51 When you have nothing to sell, you sell snake oil.
9912 2018-06-21 00:26:48 We have oil and gas companies here that are invested in cleaner energy research. 
It's about transition and done in  a smart way. Not charge forth willy nilly.
Ontario charged forth in a recless maner and is now in energy poverty.
That's not good.
9913 2018-06-21 00:26:47 The sooner a law is passed to allow assisted dying the better,& why can't people be prescribed cannabis oil for medical reasons when opiates are?
9914 2018-06-21 00:26:45 Me, clueless: did you know an olive is a fruit? That makes olive oil officially fruit juice. I mean, gaaaah, right?
9915 2018-06-21 00:26:26 I’ve had better luck so far with tea tree oil than benzoyl peroxide products.
9916 2018-06-21 00:26:07 I put this healing butter made of coconut oil, beeswax, hemp oil, shea butter & essential oils on my painfully sore muscle.

It worked in literally minutes. Wow!!Healing the body naturally is really the way to go.

9920 2018-06-21 00:25:03 Police shot a teen in the city and all the white people are being weird about it. Lady at the car place wouldn’t make eye contact with me like I knew the boy and was gonna attack her. Ma’am, I’m just here for the same overpriced oil change as you.
9921 2018-06-21 00:24:55 Google OERB for one example.   And imagine the pollution we would have today if we had to burn wood and whale oil for energy. No regulation, just free market improvement of the delivery of energy.
9922 2018-06-21 00:24:32 It’s hot outside but pasta is still a must !!! Why not have it cold with fresh veggies and olive oil and spice !!!! Pasta couldn’t be more healthier!!!! #salad #pasta #Organic
9923 2018-06-21 00:24:25 Went up dramatically actually cause the iraqi oil was out of the market for years.
9924 2018-06-21 00:24:22 Yep. I like to think Of convinced them to keep pumping oil to screw over Russia, but that would imply he wasn't absolutely vacant on foreign policy.
9925 2018-06-21 00:24:18 Trying to find pretty smelling beard oil is a real struggle.

I want to smell like a pretty flower, not a sweaty lumberjack!
9926 2018-06-21 00:24:09 No, that's not true about taxes gained from the oil and gas industry in Canada. 
The money generated in used to build,  maintain and improve our infistructure as well as going towards better forms of renewable energy research.
9927 2018-06-21 00:24:01 Skincare PSA.... Rosehip oil works wonders
9928 2018-06-21 00:24:00 I'm making chicken again, don't worry I put oil on them this time.

9934 2018-06-21 00:22:37 Interesting. I'll take the other side of all of those points...Yuan is a nothing burger even if you threw in everyone's oil (there's no bond market of relevance), China disposing of US debt would be readily gobbled up. Trade surplus = bad hand when playing poker.
9935 2018-06-21 00:22:07 Engineering? Oil?
9936 2018-06-21 00:22:04 Totally agree. The language we use really matters. I have the same issue with people@who talk about rainforest destroying oil palm. It’s a tree. It is people who do the destroying. Not the crop.

9938 2018-06-21 00:21:49 Your decision to not follow through on proportional voting was very disappointing for me as was your handling of the oil pipelines. Otherwise I appreciate your decisions. But next election time I won’t believe what you promise.
9939 2018-06-21 00:21:43 Bret, your grandchildren are going to wonder why you sold your soul to daily defend a snake oil salesman.

9944 2018-06-21 00:21:11 If OPEC and its allies don’t increase production, oil prices could rise above $100 a barrel, said Pioneer Natural Resources Co. Chairman Scott Sheffield. It’s better for the producers to act so crude stays in a range of $60 to $80, he said.

9946 2018-06-21 00:20:59 Honestly, the Saudis did more harm to #Russia at that time by intentionally cratering the price of oil & saturating global markets.

The Saudi's stated purpose was to undercut shale drilling here, but it wasn't lost on me how this hurt Assad's benefactors in #Russia & #Iran more

A REAL Greek salad...tomato, cucumber, onion, bell pepper, olives, feta, salt, oregano, olive oil, a little lemon...nom.

9970 2018-06-21 00:18:16 Trump has made clear that he thinks US troops are still needed in Iraq and Afghanistan, and even proposed sending more troops to Iraq. He also said that we should have 'grabbed' the country's oil. But he has also heavily (and incoherently) criticized US military policies.

Take out your bowl & your egg. Crack you egg into the bowl and beat it.
After beating, add your 4 tablespoons of Yougurt and mix it well. Now add the 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Then add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and mix it all (should be a smooth paste)

9981 2018-06-21 00:17:07 Ok gang its like this....

-Buy a fresh head of cabbage for about 70¢
-You chop as much as you want or need, clean it. 
-Prepare some Cup Noodles
-heat some oil in a pan and sautee some minced garlic, onion, soy sauce, and the cabbage
-pour out the broth and throw on the noodles
