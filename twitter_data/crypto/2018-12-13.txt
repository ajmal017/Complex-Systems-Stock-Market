7 2018-12-13 23:58:52 On average people who entered the market in mid-2013 are up 30x of their initial investment. 
A medium to large sized initial investment for 2013 is $3000.

With that being said, it’s likely you currently hold around $90k in crypto.
But at peak Jan 2018 held $540k

What would make you so money hungry to put your livelihood and family at risk. Only money I have ever put in to crypto is what I could lose tomorrow and still support my family.

56 2018-12-13 23:54:10 Guys, there is such amazing potential right now in tech and crypto.  You can just invent new things.  You can try all sorts of tokenization and incentivization models.  It is really an amazing time right now.

59 2018-12-13 23:53:45 Agree with everything. Also I don't think people appreciate the state the traditional markets are in at the same time. There are warning signs everywhere. With crypto being the riskiest of assets it is understandable it was the earliest to dump.

85 2018-12-13 23:51:19 When crypto prices are down, the naysayers take a victory lap.

87 2018-12-13 23:51:07 SEC seems to have the view (although not yet proven in court) that utility tokens don't exist and that it was a buzzword created purely to bypass their scrutiny and compliance.
88 2018-12-13 23:50:57 And with mobile phone companies supplying models with crypto wallets as standard this will rise exponentially in the near future. The mainstream public are coming...
89 2018-12-13 23:50:47 Price predictions for $btc, or any crypto, seem very interesting to me right now. Market cap is certainly a useful tool, but if groups are hoarding the limited supply very closely, the market cap is limitless

Any thoughts, @mark_dow, @TomSteyer, @KeithMcCullough?
153 2018-12-13 23:39:57 Anyone who is trading here in $ONO trading contest on #kucoin? How it was joining there? I've heard a lot of people getting crazy about the #MaseratiLevante prize.

154 2018-12-13 23:39:55 hows that working out in 2018?

156 2018-12-13 23:39:47 Planning on allocating funds to the crypto portfolio at year end, to be checked-in on and reallocated semi-annually. Shill me the projects which are actually buidling during the bear market. #BTC #ETH #WAVES #QTUM #XLM #ADA #XMR

161 2018-12-13 23:39:01 Just like bull markets...bear markets don’t last forever. That means #crypto too. Even your shitcoins that may die have their days again. Just look at $DOGE....somehow it’s still alive! (this doesn’t mean your coins are going back to ATH lol)
162 2018-12-13 23:38:54 The #crypto #FUD is on full blast these days, put down your Blockfolio and just #hodl and let the weak hands and sham projects fold. Better days ahead. @APompliano @MarkYusko

164 2018-12-13 23:38:36 Bitcoin is for the financial system what Internet was for businesses in the 70s right now, so give it time
165 2018-12-13 23:38:11 Even the Politician Already Can Suggest Crypto Coin Use Case.
166 2018-12-13 23:38:08 YES,  Ronnie is a newbie in the crypto space.  Always acted like one.
167 2018-12-13 23:38:07 That's like saying every stock is a pyramid scheme. Come on bro, really?
168 2018-12-13 23:37:06 I love how in 2014 @pmarca said the libertarians will turn on bitcoin once they realize it’s a completely public ledger and you can trace everything. Prescient. 

@pmarca come back to crypto twitter

202 2018-12-13 23:32:34 Crypto sentiment in the media and among normies is bizarre. 

On the one hand, bitcoin is going to $0 and everyone who believes in it is a fool. 

Then, on the other hand, you have every major financial institution preparing new exchanges, custody solutions, etc.
203 2018-12-13 23:32:32 Totally agree with you! @RevolutApp doesnt accept @NexoFinance loans for no reason. They truly hate crypto. To be called crypto friendly is just severe misrepresentation of this company.

211 2018-12-13 23:31:26 Maybe they "incorrectly assume"  that you don't really need them coins to do so. And the "price finding mechanism" is just a get rich quick scheme.

213 2018-12-13 23:31:16 re: offensive jokes, they don't exist in a vacuum. people who hold toxic views have those views reinforced by other people's ironic humor. it's the reason why crypto-fascist recruiting tactics lean so heavily on humor, because it's easier to normalize dehumanization with jokes

221 2018-12-13 23:30:18 You incessantly RT known scammer and failed financial trader peter brandt who has moved into new pastures in crypto ie selling snake oil.

You are affiliated with him.

You are a cnut.
222 2018-12-13 23:30:06 It’s another great feature of crypto currencies. Bitcoin/ Litecoin ( or many cryptos) although much alike allow the individual to choose what they want. Economic freedom. You either like Litecoin or Bitcoin or both and each can be used interchangeably. Not a bad thing.

226 2018-12-13 23:29:30 U def dont need a bank to transact w/ USD.  Its just easier to use one & credit/debit cards.  Just as its easier to buy/sell/transfer crypto on centralized exchanges.  Also, literally no merchants accept crypto so u have 2 utilize a 3rd party if u want to “buy” anything w/ crypto
227 2018-12-13 23:29:09 I’m down!
228 2018-12-13 23:29:07 I agree, maybe it will be life changing this time, if we get back to 20k and probably it will get though breaking that resistance
229 2018-12-13 23:28:37 Except that most gamers won't adopt such a software. I'm a crypto advocate, I'm aware of mining and educated on the topic. I'm a gamer and esports fan, I will never use such software.

This release has met so much criticism already from the gaming community.
230 2018-12-13 23:28:26 Since I’ve started on twitter I realize I actually enjoy debating (arguing?) with people and complaining about stuff. Not sure if this is good/bad. 
231 2018-12-13 23:27:59 While often hesitant at making such a call, we believe with steady adoption, regulatory clout lifted and shaking off the negative image crypto has accrued in 2018, then yes a new ATH  is possible, time notwithstanding.
232 2018-12-13 23:27:41 @SpiritWarriorio is worth checking out guys if you not already looked into this
233 2018-12-13 23:27:41 His apartment is reported to be full of Buddah statues so it's fine. I wonder how many Buddah statues @RonnieMoas owns to fill his Miami penthouse, bought on donations from crypto holders looking for FA? Strange he's never included photos of them in his emails

236 2018-12-13 23:27:05 I was a subscriber. In the last few days he's made a pretty good case as to why he should stick to large cap stocks and leave crypto alone. His inability to conduct any sort of research beyond what's presented to him has left me fairly dissatisfied.

240 2018-12-13 23:26:27 TBH the mood of Twitter and crypto sentiment is reminding me alot of 2015. Price action is doom, mood is doom,all the scammy shlubs have backed out. Everyone I know irl has given up on crypto. Time to sideways and accumulate. Just be patient and the riches will come again.

268 2018-12-13 23:23:37 It's a tough call between 2 and 3. I wanted more money and Bitcoin is the best version of that (because of the ideology), so that's why I invested in it and learned to trade. Ultimately I voted 3 but bc of 2 I think Bitcoin has the best chance of being the best money long term.
269 2018-12-13 23:23:17 I invested a little: for ideological reasons

I invested a lot: to make money

I invested more: because the $  is gone

276 2018-12-13 23:22:14 How much can it drop? Impossible to know. $BTC still up 300% in two years. How many assets outside of crypto you know are up 300% in two years? Also the most traded priced since January 2017 is $1000.
277 2018-12-13 23:22:12 Great news for the crypto world

289 2018-12-13 23:20:33 Weet je, van Kooten en de Bie hadden een mooie omschrijving voor mensen die weglopen uit de discussie die ze zelf zijn gestart semi-crypto-fascistoïde
290 2018-12-13 23:20:24 I have a bunch of plans question is how many will i be able to complete. My goal is to make websites that take crypto for payment like in ecom or maybe to sell services even. Try to make it more spendable.
291 2018-12-13 23:20:20 Oh, I know this. I am one. Just, my study is so much classier 
292 2018-12-13 23:20:06 No matter what anyone says, can’t trust half the souls lurking on twitter

Just ask @TheKylerMurray 

Sad that people get off on ruining others lives these days #Kyler #Crypto #SEC
293 2018-12-13 23:19:50 Check out the food/drinks on hand! Nice to know 0x will survive the harsh cold of crypto-winter.
294 2018-12-13 23:19:42 逆に増えると思うんですよw
295 2018-12-13 23:19:30 Yeah shoutout to @tradingview for the recent update with the total crypto marketcap. Maybe this is something they can work on next!
296 2018-12-13 23:19:23 @EmmanuelMacron Hi, President Macron, do you have a stance on adopting crypto currencies in France? I'm sure there are many in your country who would benefit form @Ripple and their cross-border payments, slashing costs by 75%, enabling them to send money home to their families.
297 2018-12-13 23:19:19 Doesn’t even matter if you bought bitcoin.  If you got into just about any crypto at all
298 2018-12-13 23:19:11 Yes sir. I'm Sir John BlacAfee now. 

I'm @officialmcafee from an alternate universe, who just happens to be black.

I'm still shilling @Skycoinproject project though of course.

Even in a sea of variables there's always a constant.


299 2018-12-13 23:19:03 This is clearly a security.
300 2018-12-13 23:18:55 That is odd, I love both projects and have been following and investing in both since ICO last year. They certainly are not in competition in my eyes, but building out 2 equally amazing products that will push crypto & gaming into the future.
301 2018-12-13 23:18:51 So many shorts piled up on one side of the #bitcoin boat... $BTC currently at $3260... probably see $2900s soon. Then does the boat flip over because everyone is so short... and we end up getting a great go long opportunity? @Crypto_Bitlord @CryptoDonAlt @fundstrat @BKBrianKelly

304 2018-12-13 23:18:46 Normally about 2200 BTC, but closer to 5500 since DAI was added
305 2018-12-13 23:18:42 come on Bill, they stated at the hearing today that Huber did NOT contact these whistle blowers until Meadows scheduled this hearing. I think Huber is Deep State as well, I hope I am wrong but the TRUST HUBER needs to produce something soon.
306 2018-12-13 23:18:36 Every FinTech company, Every Crypto project, is in control of their own destiny. Slow and steady wins the race.
307 2018-12-13 23:18:33 I've never had a dog. Can you actually not teach an old one new tricks?
308 2018-12-13 23:18:28 Yes.
309 2018-12-13 23:18:09 I think crypto adoption by amazon AND Ali baba, which will require China to lift the ban..maybe just lifting the ban in china would be enough..
310 2018-12-13 23:17:58 And the 2 above the C represents the double shot - well played my feather clad beaked friend
311 2018-12-13 23:17:40 Will be interesting to see the value of what is left. Won’t be much if they held it in crypto rather than converting to fiat
312 2018-12-13 23:17:32 Thanks Nugs!
313 2018-12-13 23:17:31 How about them apples!!! In the past past hour $MIOTA is up 23.5% #Cryptocurrency #Crypto #blockchain #altcoin #cryptolife #bitcointalk #decentralized
314 2018-12-13 23:17:28 Tempted to buy $50 worth lol
315 2018-12-13 23:17:06 We could never get even 100 people to pay toward the debts their country has incurred... nevermind the entire world 

Looks like someone is going to make a crypto that provides a “solution” to this mess
316 2018-12-13 23:17:02  so are the other financial structures, crypto is only good on whitepaper
317 2018-12-13 23:16:43 TBH though , hodling movement won already various times through those years. I remember the same conversations back in the dark times during 2015. Some that kept their stack then end up very well two years later
318 2018-12-13 23:16:39 When I buy shares of Amazon, eventually I have to sell back into a currency that’s worthless. It’s virtually fake. The value of the dollar appears to be worth something but it’s not. It’s the people faith in it that keeps it alive but that’s dying.
319 2018-12-13 23:16:30 Great listen! @bitstein very clear and eloquent as usual. And, Gary, thank you so much for including my question to Michael! 99% chance of "hyperbitcoinization" sounds pretty bullish! 
320 2018-12-13 23:16:29 @bytemaster7....
321 2018-12-13 23:16:27 Intangible Labs cofounder says existing stablecoins that rely on fiat backing but still give the speed and borderlessness of crypto “will actually do very well.” It appears more and more fiat backed Stablecoins might be the winners.
322 2018-12-13 23:16:26 Oh yeah I member that for sure  have you changed your avi? I remember your handle
323 2018-12-13 23:16:26 カニの女と次いつ会うのよ！

324 2018-12-13 23:16:25 Yep, someone had a very bad idea.
325 2018-12-13 23:16:23 @Freddy_Wapp_
326 2018-12-13 23:16:18 あ、でも煮込むのは汚いからガンジスに放流するね？
327 2018-12-13 23:16:14 devil's advocate part 2:  Why is crypto all about "the greater good, the greater good?"......that is laughable and a loser mindset. VC's do NOT give AF about you and your project..they here to make money. They are BRUTAL.  Just like the stock mkt. Thats all this is. WAKE UP!
328 2018-12-13 23:16:02 そしてこっちがイーサリアムだ。色々と融通が効くので大切に使っていきたい通貨だな。このお金は燃やすことによって様々な契約を行える。この時間になったら送金できるようにするとか、他の通貨での支払いをトンネルするみたいなこともできるぞ。ビットコインについで人気が高い、良い通貨だ。
329 2018-12-13 23:15:39 Oh I'm right there with you on those. 

It was actually on one of my satire threads. I was roasting @VitalikButerin and you thought I took it too far.

But he got off lightly.

No one is safe.
330 2018-12-13 23:15:36 Again?
331 2018-12-13 23:15:25 So you don’t think Ethereum used a “proper style” of consensus? I thought crypto was supposed to be every man for himself. No? Everyone was 100% free to sell ETH for ETC and didn’t, let it go man.
332 2018-12-13 23:15:06 Of course. Keep up the great content 
333 2018-12-13 23:14:35 I'm a crypto perma-bull ... I still remember when 386 was a HUGE improvement on 286 ...this 2018 #bearmarket has been "unpleasant" but I've seen the whole movie before so I'm just waiting for the happy ending :)
334 2018-12-13 23:14:35 @prestonjbyrne @ofnumbers for being sober rationalists proven right beyond greed. @jbrukh for thinking long term on crypto networks @nic__carter @tonysheng for analysis @nlw for meta, @mdudas @lawmaster just calling shit out, @hasufl for the maximalism, some of my faves...
335 2018-12-13 23:14:35 devil's advocate:  Where is it written that I have to do anything, except for myself and my family, in the ecosystem?Do you know Crypto is going to be the biggest wealth transfer since the discovery of OIL, imo? NOT a charity bro? IS as zero sum game, tho. We are seeing that now!
336 2018-12-13 23:14:22 Yeah I don’t get it, they alienate those who are currently in the crypto market,the very people who could create a positive buzz around the company....who knows maybe they’re positioning themselves for institutions, hence not giving 2 effs and rolling out BAT et al
337 2018-12-13 23:14:19 BITMAIN / ビットメイン / 比特大陆（bǐtèdàlù、びぃ⋎てぇだーるー）
338 2018-12-13 23:14:17 Hahahahaha the market is wrong 
339 2018-12-13 23:14:15 "The crypto industry moves fast"...and it's hard to filter the many assets out there??? Have a look at Coinmarketcap you bunch of absolute dollar grabbing creeps!
340 2018-12-13 23:14:02 But you think holding from now on would be as stupid as holding from 20k? A 20% drop up there hurts in USD much more than a 20% drop now. I wanted to pull out money, when it was a life changing amount. It didn’t got there for me and that would be my advice to pull money then out!
341 2018-12-13 23:13:52 結局短期トレードよりもバフェット式が相性いい
342 2018-12-13 23:13:51 I read "...with my snails" and I wondered how could that happen, why and why and how would you have snails. Are they like a pet, do you breed them for profit and then you buy bitcoinz? Is this really a thing, snails for bitcoinz? Then I read nails. Nevermind.
343 2018-12-13 23:13:50 Eppur si muove.
344 2018-12-13 23:13:49 Take a Look at my Tweet from 01 Nov. I was selling #NEXO because of too high expectations in Market. 

The dump was foreseeable. Because #crypto have 2 many moonboys who dont do enough Research. That have nothing 2 do with $NEXO. longterm they dominate 
345 2018-12-13 23:13:39 Why?
346 2018-12-13 23:13:32 Did he said somthing about buying this january? 
347 2018-12-13 23:13:26 食べたかったよおおおおおお
348 2018-12-13 23:13:23 I know what you’re saying. But think of currencies in Forex. They are representative of economies. Crypto is represents people as individual entities. So that’s where the value lies. The dollar doesn’t have any real value but the belief it in. Crypto is no different.

354 2018-12-13 23:12:47 Coinbase said that 6 months after Brad tried to bribe them. If you actually knew about Crypto, you'd have known that. What else can we expect from an $XRP hodler though...
355 2018-12-13 23:12:38 yes , that's right . we re going to 0 . sell all !!!!

358 2018-12-13 23:12:29 Haha. Sorry. Thx for saying tho I'll try to dial it back. Totally doesn't count if it was about xrp or bcash tho. I can't help that

382 2018-12-13 23:10:01 When a standard employment contract offers compensation in the form of crypto - either a single coin or a basket of them - then you have something for the masses. It should also come with an arbitrage account so you can trade your coins you earned through labor.

389 2018-12-13 23:09:12 You know how many oil companies we have in the world. The market controls the flow of oil. 97 millions barrels per day. Forget crypto and study the oil market if you want to see decentralization at work. Game theory and attack vectors included.

398 2018-12-13 23:08:30 That is correct, I was the helicopter pilot that picked him up from said village and brought him back to civilization. After being assessed he was deemed unstable enough to be on the Crypto Freakshow.

406 2018-12-13 23:07:46 I'm so mad, I'm even thinking about putting all my crypto back into the GPU cards I mined them from.
407 2018-12-13 23:07:44 Thanks that would be very useful. I as many others joined in Q3 2017, lived through the bubble without understanding trading (didn't take profits) & are living the bear market learning about risk & money management. Hopefully that will help to become a real trader on the long run
408 2018-12-13 23:07:43 In Crypto I find the Time-Money combination so exciting. It's a hobby, but you play with money. It changes the way you look at money. It becomes less important and time becomes more important. As you said: Time is more precious than money.
409 2018-12-13 23:07:19 Nah you're good bro 

You weren't rude just aggressive. So am I so we clashed.

Dw about it.
410 2018-12-13 23:07:11 When you say crypto trading platform, what do u mean? Asking for a friend

412 2018-12-13 23:06:54 Sad reality is XRP really is the standard

416 2018-12-13 23:05:59 I predict crypto will go up AND down in 2018.  Same goes for 2019.  But I don't want to extend out to 2020 just yet.
417 2018-12-13 23:05:54 And before we had crypto in europe... and before I was even able to use a computer.

420 2018-12-13 23:05:37 i'm just reading what price action and indicators are saying. crypto can go completely irrational. I wouldn't be surprised if for some reason we see a huge sell off to 1300 too.

428 2018-12-13 23:04:56 I love #crypto currency, #Bitcoin and #litecoin. The code, and function of bitcoin is revolutionary. Bitcoin is reclaiming financial freedom from the banksters. 

My fear for America is a power grid failure where my crypto can’t be used. #bitcoin will live on though.

432 2018-12-13 23:04:24 I have a couple of E-Trade accounts. It would be amazing if I could trade XRP within my trading account. You guys really should look into it.  Big things happening in the background of crypto at the moment!
433 2018-12-13 23:04:17 Got it
Thanks for everything Sir

I know from personal experience 
440 2018-12-13 23:03:29 
441 2018-12-13 23:03:21 It should become standardized for every future #crypto project to put in their whitepaper how they will plan for a bear market. What actions will they take if things get rough?

#bitcoin #cryptocurrency $btc
442 2018-12-13 23:03:16 I'd rather see crypto projects that move towards sound digital currency. Centralized fiat on a blockchain only makes their crimes easier to perpetrate.

450 2018-12-13 23:02:06 Just wanted to express my appreciation for certain people in the crypto community.  We all suffered through this bear run together, but we've only learned and have became wiser every single day.  Shout out to @Cryptonary_ @digitalassetbuy @CKJCryptonews & @AlexCobb_
451 2018-12-13 23:02:05 But what the hell has Huber been doing for 18 months if not investigating the CF?? Meadows is pretty much forcing him to do the investigation. Not a good look for Trump/Sessions and Q who has been saying all along to Trust Sessions and Huber

458 2018-12-13 23:01:42 Did crypto twitter go from bearish to bombish? 
459 2018-12-13 23:01:34 Great for you. Almost everyone lost a lot of money with crypto-tulips. You must sell now, bitcoin is going to zero

493 2018-12-13 22:56:32 Why? Because December run up was mainly a fueled rally by onramping via Coinbase, while all major exchanges closed account registrations due to too high demand. Today the on-ramp capabilities are much better and also the overall infrastructure is much more mature than a year ago
494 2018-12-13 22:56:31 Im waiting it 1/3 on 60, and then buys to 52. Preying crypto goods that he will not see 30$

512 2018-12-13 22:54:25 the richer people are, the less they care about how they dress. If someone looks like a bum, he likely is a billionaire.

514 2018-12-13 22:54:08 Looking backward it is clear that this had to happen, but BTC and Crypto always goes more than you can imagine, it went higher than most thought and it went deeper than everybody thought, probably still will go lower. But if it goes up again, it will exceed expectations again!

527 2018-12-13 22:52:52 Probably to support the narrative, “crypto is dangerous, used by the bad guys...”
528 2018-12-13 22:52:51 I think there’s a lot of manoeuvring behind scenes. Price drop is being influenced down and I don’t think it’ll stop until they see confidence shattered via social media. Better for crypto community to top up for those that can see it
529 2018-12-13 22:52:06 You do know people pay to buy BTC as well. The intrinsic value is found in countries where people don’t have banking and bitcoin solves that. With continued upgrades it will get better. I’ve done 3 business deals without a bank overseas because of BTC. No deal without it

562 2018-12-13 22:45:18 also depending WHEN you invested tends to tell a lot more of the why IMO- I found out about it after a porcfest panel in early 2013 that was in the libertarian movement with sound money etc. The earliest people were more of the tech geek type. Later in 2013 it was the ESPN moment

580 2018-12-13 22:42:21 I’d say that may be a better question for @nayafia. I usually push back about parallels to Linux if it’s for crypto because I think there’s a lot of danger of it being a big wordplay mirage we only think to make because both use the term decentralized
581 2018-12-13 22:42:18 The OTC market is keeping bitcoin and crypto prices down, not the bear market!

583 2018-12-13 22:42:05 What’s a scenario where that could change?  When the demand exceeds supply and it becomes too expensive for every day users.  We’ve now come full circle
584 2018-12-13 22:42:01 on top of this like a week before they removed stop losses for crypto so more people would panic sell

601 2018-12-13 22:39:49 Bitcoin is manipulated like the metals, difference with crypto's is when you can't control something you make regulations against it like they did starting back in December and in January, hence the fall in my opinion.

691 2018-12-13 22:29:43 Previously crypto went up and down too, but 2017 saw it gain mainstream attention/hype only to implode massively. Trust is a key feature in the cryptographic roots, but after all we saw in 2018 the public opinion lost all trust in crypto space. Only way is down from here.

705 2018-12-13 22:27:29 No one wants to buy LTC to use as a payment method when it’s dropping like a stone, crypto is a million miles away from mainstream use.

714 2018-12-13 22:26:20 People can generally admit the losses to themselves but are often found hiding it from the others. 

Talking about the losses publicly takes a lot of courage (especially when he's "crypto personality") and reflects that they are trying to learn from that experience.

720 2018-12-13 22:25:34 Decentralization’s best use is pushing legal boundaries, unlocking markets. Legal pushback clarifies the answer to “what should be decentralized?” and maybe “what should be built?”

Maybe crypto’s real boom will come after a massive legal culling convinces everyone crypto is dead
721 2018-12-13 22:25:32 the price will pump when shrimps put on the barbie can be bought with BTC

728 2018-12-13 22:24:05 Correct , but if bitcoin hit 100k in 2020 ( for example ) , then HODL works after all . History repeats
729 2018-12-13 22:24:05 Scammers everywhere! If something seems to good to be true it usually is. Also if a site wants you to deposit before you can withdraw thats usually a bad sign also. Be careful with your money guys!

730 2018-12-13 22:24:01 crypto is a harsh world. so many sad stories of people who lost everything. reminds me a little of 2008 stock market crash. this market will probably turn off a lot of people to investing in cryptocurrencies in the future unfortunately. hard to earn that trust back.

(煽られずに済みますw)
741 2018-12-13 22:22:22 I've HODLed the whole way down, not because I'm gambling on the price of BTC but because I want to preserve my assets - my satoshis - and if I sell looking to buy back in at a lower price then I am gambling with those assets.
742 2018-12-13 22:22:11 BTCの将来的なポテンシャルは高いと思ってますが、現物を沢山握っていたとしても突然数千万円になったりするような状況は起きない方がいいですよね。
743 2018-12-13 22:21:59 @teiwaz Don’t take the risk as much as it appeals to your morality/inner rage. You are needed on the front line. Entice someone in the Trump org. Don’t use crypto!
744 2018-12-13 22:21:58 you cant over-allocate hold through a drawdown and then sell at a big loss or you will always regret it 

buying a small amt and not caring if it goes down 70% or even to 0 because of the upside potential is fine.
745 2018-12-13 22:21:50 

Nah, more like feeding my brain honestly
746 2018-12-13 22:21:48 APL is decentralised and that’s the purpose of crypto if you didn’t notice. To brake the power of banks and governments and exactly the opposite of what XRP does. And if it’s fast that’s the advantage of our block chain Hermes. Get over it.
747 2018-12-13 22:21:42 We need regs on Crypto purchased and withdrawals. Bitcoin is only used for crime and money laundering. Let's require any bank in the US or any bank that does business in the US to report the names and SSN# of any Crypto purchases over $100. Just like we do for cash over $10K.
748 2018-12-13 22:21:41 Most crypto investors lost money and won't make it back. For hodling invest in value stocks, Warren Buffett style. Investing in bitcoin (a highly volatile asset that produces no cash flows and has no fundamental price floor) is best coupled with risk management and profit taking.
749 2018-12-13 22:21:33 Nickels
750 2018-12-13 22:21:20 But I am honestly excited for those that are. They get to enjoy a lot of awesome things. I think that's great.

759 2018-12-13 22:20:38 btw, ALL btc predictions comparing fractals of old bearmarkets or making assumptions based on geometric retracements or wonky mathematical functions are completely void if equities break down

bitcoin has never seen a true bearmarket outside of crypto, we might start one  soon

767 2018-12-13 22:19:40 There's a difference between blind HODLing and informed ideological HODLing.

People that fall under the latter category would only be selling out of their position with hopes to buy back in at a lower price - which is also gambling.

809 2018-12-13 22:14:02 Crypto currency was "merchandised" as a security blanket to get away from the centralized banks.  Isn't it reasonable to think now, as we approach the return of gold-back currency (eliminating the FED), there is no longer a need for crypto currency? #EndTheFed #QAnon
810 2018-12-13 22:14:01 But most people who hold makes profit more than traders , 2018 really disappointing

824 2018-12-13 22:12:24 So it's a cryptocurrency then
825 2018-12-13 22:12:22 lows have to hold and people have to stop selling. until then, the crypto turnaround can’t happen. it will just go back to zero as people who held over the last five years continue to capitulate.

868 2018-12-13 22:06:43 What matters to you isn't necessarily true for everyone else. Also it only existed for three years now, let's talk again on its tenth birthday.
869 2018-12-13 22:06:42 I don't do cocaine, i only like the smell of it.
870 2018-12-13 22:06:16 Hypothetically any crypto could make use of state channels, not necessarily lightning network. Lightning network = a state channel. Right now other state channels (alternatives to lightning network) are being built as we speak. One of which is stellar but There are many others.
871 2018-12-13 22:06:16 I agree with what you are saying. Every run up I've seen in crypto has been on anticipation of a future event, not the event itself.  This is typical of how markets work.  Not just crypto.
872 2018-12-13 22:05:55 Looking selfishly, at least it gives bitcoin some mainstream media coverage, negative that it continues to associate crypto with crime.
873 2018-12-13 22:05:47 Only civil war i see is crypto investment scammers and regulators lololol
874 2018-12-13 22:05:35 With that have been a significant life-changing event? I feel like those kind of things are obvious when it happened
875 2018-12-13 22:05:20 The worst thing in a bear market are not the falling price or seeing that you are loosing money - it’s the urge that you automatically start to convert everything in tokens what you are buying !  #maximalist #bitcoin #altcoins #crypto #money #more #blockchain
876 2018-12-13 22:05:12 Teşekkürler 
877 2018-12-13 22:05:05 “What are the hard tradeoffs in the Bitcoin system? How have past consensus rule changes impacted them? How do proposed future changes impact them?”

Compare responses from Bitcoin devs with responses from “crypto” VCs and you’ll see a surprising disconnect.
878 2018-12-13 22:04:57 If our wall isn't built soon and our Southern hemisphere neighbors  economies start collapsing, we'll be in a world of hurt. How long do you think we have till the border starts getting Bumrushed? Collapsed economies will start using #Crypto
879 2018-12-13 22:04:45 if you think crypto will just go up magically once it hits a certain number on a chart i have some $snap stock to sell you...there’s no magic bottom coming. the trend remains negative.

889 2018-12-13 22:04:04 yeah sure but the principle of most of the altcoins right now is to be faster than bitcoin or more "scalable" look at dash, litecoin, bch, etc, once bitcoin solves scalability problem the rest are garbage, few projects will survive
890 2018-12-13 22:04:01 True. Actually I think most blockchain will be developed by companies and governments by them self and only a few of the existing blockchains will actually survive long term. 6 Eu banks already have there own. 24 EU countries building there own for shipping. And no ICO's

1. People who understand why $LINK can change the world within a 5-minute summary 

2. People who think crypto is useless and won’t invest in this “scam”

$108 Billion Dollar Market Cap, imagine seeing Gold back at this range.
901 2018-12-13 22:02:44 The tags are there because I was comparing crypto to the broad scope of life... crypto is low on the totem pole

908 2018-12-13 22:02:16 good news as far as crypto goes though is that we are at the bottom of the market right now - best time to buy in.
2019 will see great increases in value again - expect all time high values again sometime in 2019.

976 2018-12-13 21:53:20 ah, ok got it. thanks  yeah, guess I recalled the past couple of yrs having long stretches with very little day to day volatility and a couple large spikes up. looking at the whole picture % wise, yes... but that has just been a crypto thing. being a new asset class and all

986 2018-12-13 21:51:43 Short answer no..long answer will include graphics of charts showing that this is normal and happened before ultimately leading to a debate that still says no. #BTC is not a bad concept but when it went from its currency form to an investable asset it screamed bubble

The good news is that at $1,000 I’ll flip sides & start shilling crypto, because at this point making fun of y’all is starting to make me feel uncomfortable, kinda like I’m beating up a deaf kid.
1003 2018-12-13 21:49:20 next bear cycle I imagine we'll see crypto in the trillion dollar market cap and we'll see a hard recession much like the dotcom bubble, luckily we'll all be locked and loaded by then

1013 2018-12-13 21:47:43 Many thanks to all of our Turkish friends! Your community has been so supportive, we want to come visit you and grow our relationship
1014 2018-12-13 21:47:40 That is what I always try to accomplish. Never be too one-sided.

It (crypto) is not a competition for which crypto will succeed and which don't. It is a competition against current currencies.
1015 2018-12-13 21:47:35 2/ Your fiat in your bank account on what do you think is based on? Beside dreams, hopes, a bunch load of BS and lies from your government? . As far as I know.. there isn't limit supply to that, it isn't mathematical enforced or typographically protected? so what's so special?

1019 2018-12-13 21:47:15 He is a guy that reads books and says they know. I run into people like this in the engineering industry all the time. Then you tell them to go out there and do it, they cant.
1020 2018-12-13 21:47:09 Hodl is fine, if combined with exit strategy, and he obviously had none. People pay price for being naive (I did too).
1021 2018-12-13 21:47:05 Nice Ozy  A great place to visit and live. Plus sometimes it offers some half decent football .
1022 2018-12-13 21:46:49 Un croyant peut vouloir montrer sa piété sans pour autant être radical.Là elle parle d’islamiste, ce qui veut dire radicalité, islamiste ne veut pas dire musulman

1027 2018-12-13 21:45:56 There was variety of cryptos donated. But (my knowledge is from may) DASH gradually came up as crypto of choice among them... and started to be used.

1038 2018-12-13 21:45:04 that's very true. i think i'm pretty comfortable with myself, but my weird eyebrow movements and random squinty faces are things i'd never noticed until... now! deep breaths and let it go, i suppose.

1065 2018-12-13 21:42:05 I wonder whether direct ban on crypto (along with any foreign currency) was unenforceable (?). Zimbabwe was going through BTC high demand for a time (they crashed it? how?)
1066 2018-12-13 21:42:04 The only crypto survivors of this bare market are the people who DON'T care about price. The tech is only that matters.
Invest with care and wait, verify and follow the real news.

1071 2018-12-13 21:41:23 These permabulls been chirpin all year nonstop about how bullish crypto would be in 2018 yet there is ZERO demand to buy $90 ETH or $3300 BTC. The charts look pathetic.

There hasn't been a single higher high on the daily all year. Not expecting a 6K retest for quite some time.
1072 2018-12-13 21:41:19 Yeah I totally forgot to mention it to you. Definitely will next time or when we have a crypto meet-up 
1073 2018-12-13 21:41:16 Hiç deme ya :D
1074 2018-12-13 21:41:15 Ignoring the rest of the cryptosphere and pursuing digital assets as a winner-takes-all centralized unit is not the way to succeed in this market. That’s the main takeaway for me when it comes to XRP. No digital asset gateway and limiting urself to one use case? XRP is garbo.
1075 2018-12-13 21:41:07 oops indikatorlerime laf mi geldi :)
1076 2018-12-13 21:41:02 Do you know how people get their bids filled? Bearish news. Retail investors will sell because of this news and I mean that’s the perfect time to fill their very liquid orders. Almost like a perfect catalyst

1120 2018-12-13 21:37:11 It's beyond me how Crypto OGs don't see the value in some projects that would like to put current businesses on a blockchain and use a token.  What about removing middlemen and their cuts?  What about more democratized, efficient systems?  What about owning your own data? etc

1136 2018-12-13 21:36:20 you don't give quality service though. you shit on people with fees and you drop stop losses at the most volatile point crypto has seen so you can steal more money from people panic selling

1159 2018-12-13 21:34:14 Let’s play a game where Jack try’s to just have one fill on ETH within $2 of the relative bottom that must be around the corner. 1ETH and then stop out $1 lower for a $1 loss.

1204 2018-12-13 21:30:15 And then charge anyone in crypto who passes through! Good idea)))

1228 2018-12-13 21:28:07 FWIW, I do think eventually there will be an untraceable crypto currency that has staying power. I just don’t think it is Bitcoin
1229 2018-12-13 21:28:04 You’re a great public speaker, I’ve seen majority of your talks on YouTube. 

Everyone is critical of their own voice. Anyone who says they are not they are lying or just accepted the way they sound to themselves.

1231 2018-12-13 21:27:47 If your private keys were leaked it doesn't really matter if your wallet is now closed. And really the only way to know is when you get hacked, there is a fixed CLI wallet that has been released for ARO that doesn't have the PK leak bug in it

1241 2018-12-13 21:26:50 I’ve wondered this myself, about any crypto declared a security.  Short of maybe price tanking from people panic selling the news...what does it ACTUALLY mean for the average hodler of that particular crypto? Will exchanges have to de-list?  Love to hear some answers on this.
1242 2018-12-13 21:26:45 They want years end to be much lower --> so that they complete their operation crypto fud and bring the real winter to the crypto. Next year will be pivotal - from sanctions to recession -- if crypto hype survives, it'll be definitive for the years to come.
1243 2018-12-13 21:26:38 Too late,crypto is dead -:)
1244 2018-12-13 21:26:34 No. It lost $15,000 In a year.
1245 2018-12-13 21:26:23 I trust by now you’ve seen a number of instances of crypto related projects being dumped by mail chimp. Just FYI :-)

1247 2018-12-13 21:26:06 
1248 2018-12-13 21:26:04 I'll buy more. I'm looking at the future possibilities, and I'll still own the same amount of coins even if it hits 1 cent.
1249 2018-12-13 21:25:58 Ah I see you’re a believe of fud. So what happens if we bottom out at 2.5k? And I’m 2 months we’re up at 5k again? I won’t be because I’ll be averaging in. So I will probably only be 10% down
1250 2018-12-13 21:25:57 The bottom is in once a major coin dies.
1251 2018-12-13 21:25:57 
1252 2018-12-13 21:25:51 Very not cool. Nic's helped me make plenty of money inside and outside of crypto. You of all people should realise you can make money both ways in a market. You think she doesn't tell people about risk management or something? She does.
1253 2018-12-13 21:25:45 I think the wrong kind of questions are being asked, to be fair. For example, GOLD isn‘t paying any interest or dividends neither, correct?

1267 2018-12-13 21:24:21 It is. An all of full frontal attack coming from fintech and crypto. If fintech can migrate the whole stack for a mortgage to titles it’s all over for the banks. No mortgages to loan and no currency to lend.
1268 2018-12-13 21:24:07 Is Crypto growing or dying? 

As we enter into a bear market, the inevitable "death of crypto" articles start sprouting up 

But experts like @jon_choi_ think otherwise. After all, he left a "dying industry" working on Wall Street.

Enter Crypto

1283 2018-12-13 21:22:34 Lightning network (or state channels in general) is the greatest innovation in terms of scaling permissionless blockchains. 
State Channel Example:
1. Open channel
2. Perform many tx’s or updates
3. Close channel and settle/confirm all tx’s from channel onto a blockchain

1307 2018-12-13 21:19:24 I personally think it has to do with the fact that they actually receive bonuses based on the fact if their story “moves markets”. With how volatile Crypto is, i suspect this is someone taking advantage of the bear market and mob mentality

1409 2018-12-13 21:04:42 Bitcoins previous crashes in valuation are averaged at about 86%. If history is any indicator, the price will bottom somewhere around $2800. We are currently at $3200. Even though the logarithmic scale is beginning to flatten, there is still a huge potential for growth here.

1423 2018-12-13 21:03:23 perhaps crypto isn’t really in a bear market but instead is in a liquidation market.
1424 2018-12-13 21:03:13 ML keeps getting bigger, but I did not see a lot of mainstream mentions about ML the way AI/ML was mentioned in 2016, and BTC/Crypto was mentioned in 2017.

1431 2018-12-13 21:02:40 Right now, entering the crypto space as an investor/speculator is about as easy as it will get in the next 3 years. Yet people STILL are not ready to put in the necessary work.

1472 2018-12-13 20:59:47 It's not singing a tune - my view is that bakkt, and places like Deutsche boerse getting involved are happening because they think there is more to come. If crypto is dead, why would they bother?
1473 2018-12-13 20:59:28 At some point they have to do a financial reset (i.a. debt cut). And if there is a backup system in place like crypto currency, then the transition will be smoother. But I have never been in a financial reset. 
This is pretty abstract to me as well.

1476 2018-12-13 20:59:18 I agree with you about the "I quit" part.  I thought he was talking about notice.  Did you hear about the kid who just quit at a Walmart and announced it on the store intercom?

It allows fiat smart contracts, data driven smart contracts, interoperability between all systems, & data monetization. It connects the current economy with blockchain tech instead of trying to replace it. Read the article!

1500 2018-12-13 20:56:29 TRADING TIP

When we break market structure, the size of the breakout is important. The bigger the breakout, the bigger the pullback (not always). 

You have to look at the market differently when looking for entry reasons for each scenario.

1512 2018-12-13 20:55:01 but we wont be anywhere near above 6k until 2020. 6k was 10 month support in 2018 so it will take AT LEAST 10 months to break back above 6k. it wont happen in 2019. if you're a trader just take the money you would use to buy btc at 3k and just trade/invest it elsewhere

1514 2018-12-13 20:54:39 Even if it’s a rumor. People talk about it now and crypto is going nowhere. In a couple of years crypto is mainstream and the world is prepairing for it now. Don’t worrie, we will be fine as early adopters. This is gonna be so big that a nucleair blast looks small

Well, weren’t we all high on crypto last Xmas? Glad you got out ~ok. Some poor souls traded like crazy and IRS will collect from shattered Blockfolios or else. Dodged that bullet!

I know you have edgy humor but you don't put names in echoes or do other stuff that would make me think you're a crypto like he does. There's a reason I still respond to you occasionally.

They know nothing of/about etoro. One year ago crypto's was still cfds and etoro coming a long way. Keep up the good work etoro

1741 2018-12-13 20:27:14 Listened too your podcast since day 1. Been at this many years. Thanks for sharing. I did something like this in 2013-2015.

1917 2018-12-13 20:06:32 Many corporations around the world seek to conduct their legitimate businesses and move their funds to pay manufacturers, vendors, suppliers, and secure high capital deals privately as currently done in central system. with DAPS, it can be done more securely, faster and cheaper.
1918 2018-12-13 20:06:25 thanks for post!
1919 2018-12-13 20:06:10 For one, centralized. You think Coinbase cares about your privacy? Two, they are professionals at tying up your crypto and not giving you access to it for days........banks
1920 2018-12-13 20:05:57 Get off your high horse. Nobody says this about “crypto.”

You realize Bitcoin is miles ahead every other “crypto” put together when it comes to scalable, lightning (pun intended) fast payments.

1925 2018-12-13 20:05:40 so.. although I'm not hoping or thinking this happens.. what would you say about fractional reserve crypto custodians if on 3rd jan one of the exchanges you use has a liquidity crisis due to a decent % withdrawing the crypto they're supposed to have on there?

1991 2018-12-13 19:58:31 This is not a good business strategy. It is very confusing to average users who don't understand crypto which is their target market. Furthermore the economics of Bitcoin *does* dictate that a single proof of work blockchain will dominate all others.

1999 2018-12-13 19:57:42 It eliminates the *need* for 3rd parties in many cases. It doesn't eliminate the existence or option of 3rd parties where such make sense.  A crypto world is one with many 3rd parties, and in which nobody is forced to use any of them. IE - it's a market.

Then resell at 10x. Waiting for $20K or $200K Bitcoin is like waiting for $589 XRP.  Not part of the crypto dream club.

2027 2018-12-13 19:53:01 Crypto market is a crazy roller coaster, I think it's safer to ride with currencies which profitability is proven with time
2028 2018-12-13 19:52:40 İnşallah olur. 
2029 2018-12-13 19:52:19 Coins have to move lol
2030 2018-12-13 19:52:18 Find a way to integrate Crypto #XRP
2031 2018-12-13 19:52:13 Why don't you think crypto communities have shared principles? While there might not be 100% agreement, I think a handful of the leading projects have a high degree of alignment of values and social / technical approaches..
2032 2018-12-13 19:52:04 As a senior in high school I got made fun of when core was available on b cuz it was the only thing I talked about. 
 When I installed it on the uni's comps in 2010 I was damn near kicked out. 
After the gox crash, i thought it was over.
Now history has repeated.

2038 2018-12-13 19:51:03 Bitcoin Price Near $3,400, Wider Crypto Markets See Another Mild Slump

                After experiencing a small rebound yesterday, crypto markets are seeing another mild slump today, Bitcoin hovers around $3,400

2114 2018-12-13 19:38:12 Did you see all the negative comments. OMG. Most are just pure ignorance. Sad. I've not had any problem over the few months since I joined for crypto. It's a great idea to transfer crypto over and use a debit card without transferring anything out. I like it!
2115 2018-12-13 19:37:53 Personal opinion- Poppy and Ante are setting up to be the most valuable assets on the Tron network.

2122 2018-12-13 19:36:09 no,ive never said where is confirmation. as this goes lower &lower the trend reversal trend gets lower and lower also.if youre a trader youre not a long term investor so i dont even understand why you keep disputing this entire argument. smart traders never catch falling knives
2123 2018-12-13 19:36:00 When I post a TA chart, it isn't done in certainty. 

My goal is to provide you with just a trading idea.

An appropriate entry, stop, and target for that specific play.

You are responsible for your own trades. 

Everyone has a different risk tolerance. 

Figure out yours.
2124 2018-12-13 19:35:58 A car accident seem pretty safe compared to being shot in the chest.
2125 2018-12-13 19:35:48 You really think crypto is a better investment BEFORE traditional stocks? I disagree. People in crypto have been crushed by following this advice. Nearly all coins are down 80%+ from when the public got ahold of the industry. Stocks = investing. Crypto = speculative.

2170 2018-12-13 19:29:52 I truly believe once all the greed in the Crypto market is wiped, when all the weak hands get shaken and when all the get-rich-quick guys are over is when BTC will restart. It is difficult to see any better option as protection /Gold excluded/ considering world's debt.

2185 2018-12-13 19:27:46 You bought on a platform that has no way of removing your bought crypto then moan when you can’t remove it 
2186 2018-12-13 19:27:40 How is that a Crypto wallet? It seems like it's just an ethereum wallet which can engage with ethereum based ERC20 Tokens and other smart contracts.
2187 2018-12-13 19:27:37 no he is a cryptobro, right Sir @Crypto_Bitlord ?
2188 2018-12-13 19:27:16 To risky people,  stay out of crypto and stocks....better savé and buy some land in some village. BTC is not going to zero, but it still can drop to 1000$ and lover.

2191 2018-12-13 19:26:45 Only a rumor for now sweet pie :)
2192 2018-12-13 19:26:26 Bitcoin might not be the most technologically advanced crypto currency out there, but it is the biggest and it is "the base". It has also stood the test of time having lost 90% of its value many times to end up recovering.
2193 2018-12-13 19:26:23 Unpopular opinion: the only reason we "love" crypto is because we are greedy fucks.
2194 2018-12-13 19:26:17 Eh its all good.  I consider the fee at this point a "tip" for taking my lame arse Fiat, at these price points, in an industry that we love and need to continue to grow.
2195 2018-12-13 19:26:00 In the beginning... Ripple found that a combined product including Xrapid (Crypto assets) would not work for adoption by fi's. To big a step. Therefore they seperated it. Hence the fact it's now one product again, is actually very encouraging in view of adoption.
2196 2018-12-13 19:25:53 Not quite a meat bag.
The law of Conservation of Energystates that "Energy cannot be created or destroyed." In other words, the total amount of energy in the universe never changes, although it may change from one form to another. Energy neverdisappears, but it does change form.
2197 2018-12-13 19:25:49 Just the tip...
2198 2018-12-13 19:25:46 I would love to see social responsibility added to all crypto projects rather than just a few whales making donations to specific groups etc.... this is grassroots - any coin, any platform and a charity of choice confirmed wallet address can receive the payout - I love it!

2272 2018-12-13 19:14:44 It was pretty steady growth though for most of 2017... until mid Dec spike. For 2018 it has pretty much just fallen with the broader market with a couple random spikes. Guess my head scratching moment was that crypto is volatile... not just XRP.

2288 2018-12-13 19:10:38 I like your content, but I disagree on this. The functional ability that BTC brings as a trust protocol fundamentally changes the way we look at value mechanisms entirely.

Although, that's assuming BTC wins the protocol wars. If not, then yes it's more of a pyramid

2291 2018-12-13 19:10:05 The city on the hill is to get into crypto. It's based on strict mathematics that will eventually destroy the centralized system. Go DLT. By the way, I am not into crypto for the money. I am into it for my children. Please, get in.
2292 2018-12-13 19:10:02 I don’t want to be a dick, but the letters on the two pictures are different...
2293 2018-12-13 19:09:57 @mappopk_crypto great job, keep it up
2294 2018-12-13 19:09:56 Even a broken clock is right twice a day.
2295 2018-12-13 19:09:49 @stephenasmith to start paid crypto trading group.  Analysts to include but not limited to #hunterhenry and #derrickjohnson.  @cryptomanran rumored to be involved
2296 2018-12-13 19:09:47 $19,797 ... is was all a dream 
2297 2018-12-13 19:09:38 Yes Cohen was a bad lawyer, that's why Trump hired him.  My tweet was about CNN though, but thanks for the information.
2298 2018-12-13 19:09:36 $20K happened on Bitmex Swap, and $24K on futures. All time high on futures REKT is $54K lol
2299 2018-12-13 19:09:22 @officialmcafee @Team_McAfee hi guys just wondering how influential you think the APL block chain tech will be to the future of crypto. And where in say 5 years you think APL will stand. I think NO 1-2. Thanks for any feed back @ApolloCurrency
2300 2018-12-13 19:09:10 #Nocoiner Legacy experts:

 "There is no use case for #crypto and no intrinsic value."

Actual people who use it for the first time: 

"Holy crap! This is awesome. It's gonna change everything."

Seriously legacy, you are starting to sound ridiculous.
2301 2018-12-13 19:09:04 Will you change this? This will greatly influence future investments in crypto on your platform, that's for sure and I am pretty sure as well 90% of other crypto users are on the same boat. All you have to do is take a look at the comments on the platform...
2302 2018-12-13 19:08:47 Appreciate it mate! 
2303 2018-12-13 19:08:31 Clown
2304 2018-12-13 19:08:29 In the last year of following crypto voices I think I have seen every single dollar amount from 0-10000000$ as the next price of bitcoin.
2305 2018-12-13 19:08:20 Talking , crypto, the
2306 2018-12-13 19:07:54 That will never happen, the media drives down the price and buys up cheap, once they achieve buy price the fud stops and it all becomes positive, that's how they get average Joe's coins, only this time they pushed too hard, it will bounce but they are getting nervous.
2307 2018-12-13 19:07:48 Crypto is most definitely the future. But there have been many times throughout history that a large amount of individuals, were wrong.
2308 2018-12-13 19:07:42 taboot taboot
2309 2018-12-13 19:07:34 bear or bull? BEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR
2310 2018-12-13 19:07:18 So when the price is going up its ok to get the attention and shit out predictions but now that your wrong the market is wrong. 
Learn to talk about the right topics like @aantonop instead of PRICE.
2311 2018-12-13 19:07:00 Can we just agree that rules #1,2,3,4 are all being addressed here all at once? (cc: @Truthcoin, @derose, @mikeinspace, @junseth, @miketwenty1) For the record, #1. "I'm an idiot", #2. "you're an idiot", #3. "markets are efficient", #4. "you don't want that" 
2312 2018-12-13 19:06:57 Like I mentioned in Evan's post it explains the constant sniffling, the dry mouth for words like 'anonymous' and 'united schates' and the audio of what definitely sounds like snorting a line that was on the Cohen tapes
2313 2018-12-13 19:06:28 Are there crypto coins which bet against crypto markets?
2314 2018-12-13 19:06:17 Not that I don't believe in #crypto.  But people said the same of the #tulipmania
2315 2018-12-13 19:06:02 Weed stock behaves like $crypto now.  breaking all level of support.  0 is the bottom.  $tlry 50 maybe pychological one.   Will have to check fibonacci level later. $cron $cgc
2316 2018-12-13 19:06:02 Simple, crypto costs more (dev, tume, hardware, etc) so IoT vendors, who are already in a race to the bottom, won’t until they need to (ie laws, LOL) or folks stop buying cheaply made “smart” garbage.
2317 2018-12-13 19:05:54 Hope the FAM and bump is doing well 
2318 2018-12-13 19:05:45 Amazing! Thanks!
2319 2018-12-13 19:05:44 No one knows the bottom. But still bottom is $1300.

2331 2018-12-13 19:03:08 I have seen Most of your speech and You are awesome. There is absolutely no change required. You are full of excitement and your passion about Crypto is at Par. You are Natural AF. BTW The Dimples on cheeks add extra charm. What can i Say. 
2332 2018-12-13 19:03:07 Some is great, some of it needs to be balanced +talk about more risks, but it's a great start. Re CFTC, the Q's are the most technical of questions any regulator globally has dived into the tech. Despite what we think, governments are stakeholders in crypto too.

2337 2018-12-13 19:02:02 Great job guys.  Once you get crypto custodianship worked out, you guys will be a 1 stop shop.  I already play the options game with you, and I’ll be opening a checking and savings account as well.
2338 2018-12-13 19:01:58 it isn't any less safe than what we have today.

2345 2018-12-13 19:00:45 @coin_signals fiasco:  CT cant be that dumb. Guy inspect elements trades. "Please anonymous CT trader take my hard earned $ trade it without fund formation documents or a PPM, zero exempt fund status at all, please sir just make money i trust you" wtf did you expect #crypto

2352 2018-12-13 18:59:38 Theres something therapeutic about trolling...
2353 2018-12-13 18:59:27 yes! so how come it has 'asto' in it. where this term 'asto' comes from 'asti' which means 'hota hai' in Hindi. 
Similar to the term 'namaste' which has the root 'aste' which means reahta hai.
A Sanskrit term in the Persian language? 
@MisraNityanand

2354 2018-12-13 18:59:23 You forgot to quote "all".

2370 2018-12-13 18:57:26 You mean to say that basing tokens on physical bricks that will forever stay in a wall that will only be weathered, over time, by the southern sun, therein invariably needing new issuance, with no hope of a secondary market, is not how you should use crypto? J'shocked. Shocked.
2371 2018-12-13 18:57:25 call me a bitcoin snowbird cause i'm spending the crypto winter covering IPOs
2372 2018-12-13 18:57:15 That's 19
2373 2018-12-13 18:56:11 Yeah, if you trade at least 10% up daily
2374 2018-12-13 18:56:10 I would go homeless before I sold my crypto! I would want to shoot myself if I sold my crypto for a loss and then a year later find out I could have been a millionaire if I would have just held on for another 12 months.
2375 2018-12-13 18:56:09 Nobody even knows what the Blockchain is. Why is anybody surprised crypto crashed?
2376 2018-12-13 18:55:51 Crypto will succeed because nothing happens without full faith that it will happen and so many people believe that crypto is the future.
2377 2018-12-13 18:55:29 Are you the NPC that's programmed to randomly call other people NPCs? If not, here's your chance to share what you're doing it the real world to build something in the crypto space.

2382 2018-12-13 18:54:48 The value of bitcoin has been going down since December last year. And crypto is still expanding and becoming prominent, bitcoin just peaked and plummeted bc of the hype. That doesn’t mean crypto isn’t worth investing in or researching.
2383 2018-12-13 18:54:40 - Creators call it crypto
- It has a white-paper 
- It was suppose to be token, NEM and now Dash 
- It uses cryptography 
- It has a premine (similar to ETH) 
- It has a block explorer
- It has a history of scam like many other so call cryptos

Maybe a cybercoin is a better name
2384 2018-12-13 18:54:32 I got hacked in Oct 2017 lost all my crypto 20k worth, sold my silver and loaned out 10k to buy them back. It peaked at 200k spent 6 month's in Thailand now worth 10k but I have a lot more coins.. Couldnt give a shit tbh I can wait a year 
2385 2018-12-13 18:54:30 puts btc in the title, then says nothing about btc lol, dude has lost it.  none of this stuff is useful as a MOE because of greshams law, if crypto is better than fiat, nobody will spend crypto given the choice.
2386 2018-12-13 18:54:26 Hey George keep doing what you do, very great job. Don't listen to the haters. I think you're the most honest crypto influencer in the space.
But please take care of your health. It's more important than anything.
You have my support.
Have a good day man.
2387 2018-12-13 18:54:21 What’s keeping you from picking it up? Crypto?

2389 2018-12-13 18:54:10 I think bitcoin token is one of the biggest project of this year, @bitcoin_token bitcoin token is low price as of now. But in future? See btk have alot of exchage site. And also they feature in other crypto website..maybe not no but in future

2391 2018-12-13 18:53:49 If you told 16 year old Martin that in 17 years he'd be sitting in a 2' x 4' room listening to Live Ethiopian Jazz and working on a budget spreadsheet for recruiting a crypto company and enjoying the shit out of it, he would have snot laughed his Dr. Pepper...
2392 2018-12-13 18:53:29 Too many blocks, too complicated to use.... Keep it simple... 
2393 2018-12-13 18:53:25 1. Global arrest warrants don't exist
2. Governments would need to invest in hardware which would push the price of Crypto higher
3. PoS is probably more secure than PoW
2394 2018-12-13 18:53:07 Can’t wait for my turn
2395 2018-12-13 18:53:01 When Paris?
2396 2018-12-13 18:52:54 In the world of $crypto, it’s important to pay attention to the full spectrum of reasonable opinion and respect all perspectives.

Anything from the conservative @saifedean to the moderate @pierre_rochard to the unorthodox loose cannon @TuurDemeester ought to cover it.
2397 2018-12-13 18:52:44 Just watched the video.  Did zero analysis of competing crypto currencies.  It touted the power of the lightning network while emphasizing how it was in its infacy and would improve exponentially. Other technologies/currencies will follow suit and address issues/close the gap imo
2398 2018-12-13 18:52:40 Working for a mobile phone company ve been installing crypto apps on phones before we sell them lol
2399 2018-12-13 18:52:35 Hi David! I think that's part of the story. The other bigger part is the crypto mining interest and relevant prices have both dramatically came down. That was a big part of their "additional contributions" that is simply no longer there.

2416 2018-12-13 18:50:59 Same. Many ppl I thought would still be here now are dust on the crypto landscape.
2417 2018-12-13 18:50:58 did you win???? @mappopk_crypto
2418 2018-12-13 18:50:39 It’s not even a crypto. You can’t mine it 
2419 2018-12-13 18:50:37 No, I just have my own trading + leverage group
2420 2018-12-13 18:50:22 You’ve no idea what I even meant. :) Have fun. I’ll check Back if crypto replies
2421 2018-12-13 18:50:20 Hopefully a huge coin burn.
2422 2018-12-13 18:50:14 There’s gotta be someone getting in to crypto right now for the first time.. 

What wild times to start getting into $BTC / #crypto
2423 2018-12-13 18:49:46 The blockchain technology is tightly envelop our world, if we spend time, instead, we need to be different, we'll get to it sooner or later, but time will be missed, not to lose it today! The company shows high activity from investors! #Gigzi #crypto

2427 2018-12-13 18:49:35 Lol. Gish gallop. Yes. Circular. You assumed this is how it worked so interpreted within that paradigm. As stated I’ll leave this to crypto. I’ve got the stomach flu and not up to this right now.
2428 2018-12-13 18:49:34 The caliber of the rhetorical style seems to be crashing faster than a crypto wallet (if that’s possible!) omg 
2429 2018-12-13 18:49:32 Beeeeeeeeeeear
2430 2018-12-13 18:49:29 Why would you ever get involved in an emerging nd super risky market if you achieved that. I believe you cos you've always seemed genuine yo me but by God man. Crypto is super speculative and always has been.

2438 2018-12-13 18:48:29 Drink after the presentation, not before. Worst thing for the crypto community is to make it look as not accurate or not serious on their proposals. Practice before, check your videos and  make a list of “do” & “do not” for yourself. Time and practice do the rest

2444 2018-12-13 18:47:58 I'm mainly a lurker/DYORer/retweeter but I find your Twitter feed invaluable. 

I've been involved with crypto since 2013, made some decent moves & wonder how do you break through to the next level in regards to networking in this space? 

Any advice?
2445 2018-12-13 18:47:47 People often ask me why I #invest in crypto? I invest in #crypto to support the growth of a more #decentralized, open society. I believe crypto has an enormous potential to weaken the dominance of existing leaders in all industries and thus level the playing field.
2446 2018-12-13 18:47:45 few days up down :D
2447 2018-12-13 18:47:43 That's probably true yeah.
2448 2018-12-13 18:47:35 BTC dominance has held steady around 54% over the last week. We expect BTC dominance to remain in a range of 48% - 58% for the near future. #Bitcoin #BTC #Crypto #Investing #Trading

2465 2018-12-13 18:45:18 Not sure, I think there should be but I havent received any more. Maybe they posted something in their blog?
2466 2018-12-13 18:44:58 I don't trade in bots, they can be easily manipulated by large buy or sell orders. I trade through TA.
2467 2018-12-13 18:44:56 Shameful and gross. Not buying that laptop I was planning.

Crypto eats up .5-1% of energy use (a huge number) for imaginary work at a time our world needs radical energy policy.

This is ignorance, greed, thievary, and waste.

Come on @Razer, step up and do better.
2468 2018-12-13 18:44:53 And this won't happen again as the world will not fomo again on bitcoin.. Institutional investors dont fomo so likelyhood of such a pump is near to ZERO

2475 2018-12-13 18:44:03 Perhaps I’ve been in crypto for too long and I don’t get excited by a lot of gimmicks, but all of the crypto Christmas lists I’ve been seeing really suck balls.  Perhaps the only thing I’ve seen that I would buy is the Satoshi white paper as wall Art  where’s all the cool shit?

2497 2018-12-13 18:40:59 It’s crazy to see how fast crypto is evolving...and it’s speeding up. More stoked about crypto rn that ever.

2507 2018-12-13 18:40:05 Been in crypto when DASH was DARKCOIN.

Been in speculative markets longer than you'd imagine. 

Sure as BTC enters a bull cycle so will DASH/USDT will follow. Keep and eye on DASH/BTC and see if it's sustainable 

Sure Amanda was a keep proponent during DASH is run.

2510 2018-12-13 18:39:44 A lesson for crypto community OPSEC, avoid risk includes decentralized bad habits, asymmetrical behavior, not being labeled for vices or “general unacceptable” patterns to become a target.

2551 2018-12-13 18:31:56 At some point the tech must out pace the speculative price.  I personally believe some of these projects have found their bottom and the BUIDL process is very well underway!  Crypto is not dead.   #thebottoming

2562 2018-12-13 18:30:45 This judge has definitely been paid. No doubt about it. Now with #Elections2018 going a certain way, these crypto congis will support the ecosystem even more shamelessly.

2687 2018-12-13 18:12:23 I’ll admit the price of bitcoin comes from speculation on its future applications. Right now, it is cheaper and easier to transfer value with bitcoin than gold or fiat. But if you don’t see any application then I’m going to stop wasting my time with you

2691 2018-12-13 18:11:51 Try to turn off your emotions while trading crypto.. Your mind probably told you to buy $BTC when it was on it's road to $20000, same as it tells you to sell at $3000. Get it in control! 
2692 2018-12-13 18:11:45 I believe that the time will come soon. Crypto as a security haven with a world starting to get into turmoil, will accelerate its importance.

2712 2018-12-13 18:09:26 Based on many [Insert Alt Here] / BTC charts, it seems we haven't come close to retracing completely from the last 2 years or so of bull run. I'm guessing some alts continue bleeding or treading water as BTC dips and eventually finds a range for the next year. #bitcoin #crypto

2716 2018-12-13 18:09:04 Every asset in Vzla is in a system the gov controls directly via currency manipulation.  Devaluating the currency is more insidious

In this pension debacle they get about same amount and they get many people to use a crypto currency. Devaluating the currency robs people

2720 2018-12-13 18:08:55 Ironically, a bond denominated in crypto and issued by a high quality issuer, would probably make a better collateral for a stablecoin.

2723 2018-12-13 18:08:25 Prediction: @CashApp will displace Venmo as the primary mobile payments software by 2023.

Why? Focus, design, and detachment from traditional banking: Cash card with discounts, ability to buy crypto, and public payments are massive and that's just the beginning.

2768 2018-12-13 18:02:10 "ETH looks promising for next wave of crypto apps"

Is it too much to ask that the current wave of crypto apps get some traction first, i.e., getting more users than they have developers, before we jump right to the next wave?
2769 2018-12-13 18:02:01 I’m averaging in from here - even if it’s bear market for the next 1-2 years I can wait. So much positivity going on behind the scenes ranging from bakkt - etf - Samsung s10 support for built in crypto wallet.

2775 2018-12-13 18:00:43 I don’t have an opinion about the harm it may inflict on exchanges (I hope they take the time to prepare), but on the plus side if the market wants to be serviced by exchanges that are fully reserved and not reliant on custodial fees, then this helps enforce that preference

2784 2018-12-13 17:59:54 
2785 2018-12-13 17:59:54 For any US based Crypto investors (individuals or corporations) that are looking at high capital gains taxes you should look into opportunity zones in your area. Personally I would much rather reinvest in my community than in the IRS
2786 2018-12-13 17:59:46 I think $NVDA is strongly correlated to the crypto market.
2787 2018-12-13 17:59:42 
2788 2018-12-13 17:59:27 1/ Of course in our detailed reports we never said a bounce was a "sure thing", there are no certainties in Crypto. But we did say there was a higher "probability" for a bounce based on past cycle data. Also given that a bounce has followed every sell off this year.

2791 2018-12-13 17:58:49 One of the thing that has surprised me the most about the young entrepreneur/maker community is how little they have read about crypto.

Would def encourage more reading and research in that area.  It is the future of a good part of what we will see in tech in the next 10 years.

That is why Crypto winter didn’t deter investors quite the opposite, the numbers nearly doubled in 2018 from 18 million to 35 million, a Cambridge University report found. Crypto ecosystem is growing in spite of the bear market. Wake up or get left behind

2836 2018-12-13 17:53:25 So just as people were wrong about 5k they could be wrong about the bottom not being in. If I've learned 1 thing from crypto is to expect the exact opposite of what you're expecting
2837 2018-12-13 17:53:25 I mean compared to the other crypto’s you have available XRP has the highest spread, doesn’t have x2 leverage, and the wallet is perpetually ‘pending’

2853 2018-12-13 17:51:55 It's not just a correction.. people think it's dead but it's another day in crypto. Look over the years happens everytime. Smart money accumulating. Theres a ton of projects that are great. Research and follow some good crypto Twitter accounts

2856 2018-12-13 17:51:46 Sir, when live stream? Did the dishwasher detergent tablet fix you?
2857 2018-12-13 17:51:24 Excellent, Chad.  And of course this is just a proposition of common sense that the crypto-Marxists (the Distributists) have to pretend not to see: merit is the closest thing to the just distributive criterion.
2858 2018-12-13 17:51:08 the lower it go , the more people buy it.. then think of the mass adoption if company's and individual stock investors. retail that accept crypto more and more all over the world .the time wil come and this are the time's to get more if you have trust in it.
2859 2018-12-13 17:51:08 So yours is converted to crypto and brought through the secret tunnels before it is changed back to  currency and deposited into your secret wall vault!
2860 2018-12-13 17:50:58 A lot of crypto is way more affordable now.. the question is does it drop further before it takes off again.
2861 2018-12-13 17:50:53 Bitcoin is like the perfect pyramid scheme only decentralised
2862 2018-12-13 17:50:53 Get back to crypto ya bum.

2879 2018-12-13 17:48:55 @digitalassetbuy I see TD are creating ad's explaining how you can gain exposure to crypto without actually owning it. A long video explaining what blockchain is etc.. Looks like they are all in and want a piece of the boom :)
2880 2018-12-13 17:48:45 Because there is no garantuee we should proceed in two ways. Try to drive research to get to that green-potential for the future and at the same time push for a regulation framework for big central crypto mining, that keeps the outcome in check if free market research fails.

2910 2018-12-13 17:45:53 Are there any left?
2911 2018-12-13 17:45:53 True! Crypto winter didn’t deter investors quite the opposite, their numbers nearly doubled in 2018 from 18 million to 35 million, a Cambridge University report found. Ecosystem growing in spite of the bear market, a new bull market is inevitable
2912 2018-12-13 17:45:51 Gotta earn ya stripes.
2913 2018-12-13 17:45:38 Yea 100 is amazing already as well

EU must build 5G modems+SoC Factories
2919 2018-12-13 17:45:05 And Rand predicted it!
2920 2018-12-13 17:45:01 We don't know what they claimed because a lot of stuff was redacted. We're going to have to wait until Mueller is ready to report to find out what's what. The campaign finance charges are separate and we're brought by SDNY.

2922 2018-12-13 17:44:50 There may be a new crypto global currency in 2050, the odds of all the tech today being relevant  in 32 years is slim.  New things always come along.
2923 2018-12-13 17:44:49 he’s probably showing his frat bros at Yale this video saying “dude I totally owned those crypto dudes, did you see me?!” Also noted since pomp is closer to his age he felt he could pick on him because he was so much “smarter” and had more experience.
2924 2018-12-13 17:44:45 dump me hard pls

2931 2018-12-13 17:43:52 Another recession, which is likely, will likely increase the demand for crypto

2934 2018-12-13 17:43:41 I know raising capital as a crypto HF has been hard the last 2-3Q’s. It’s going to be monumentally more difficult next year when you have less than 5 positions in your portfolio bc everyone else will too. Transition & do VC; 3-7yr locks. Invest in building the infrastructure.
2935 2018-12-13 17:43:37 Value is scarce man, even if Kaz was up there, most wont take in the info and judge the mask or his grammar, look at the 99% nitpicking Musk’s tweets  #RuleOfTheAtom
2936 2018-12-13 17:43:33 Upset about a bear market?

Try trading elsewhere. There are other more reliable markets that can make you money. Don't leave crypto, just make another cash stream to take profits from for crypto.
2937 2018-12-13 17:43:10 Wondering about this new generation of noobs we are gonna dump on

#Crypto #Ltc
2947 2018-12-13 17:42:33 But ur right where is this Satoshi? I got a family to feed, hes probably enjoying his riches while we re suffering
2948 2018-12-13 17:42:30 Timing of investment are very important tough, no matter the amount you put in. If you invest/averaging in near bottom of a bear market, the risk goes slightly down. Timing should be implemented in risk assessements.
2949 2018-12-13 17:42:28 John you let these trolls get to you these are people that have nothing else better to do they don't even take stop to have a good glass of Glenfiddich just ignore me by the way have you ever listened to crypto king yet made song in honor of you

2954 2018-12-13 17:41:41 I think this is what a few tech giants have already realized. Amazon's recent crypto-related domain purchases seem to indicate this is true.
2955 2018-12-13 17:41:41 “RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIPPLE”

It’s for sheep.
2956 2018-12-13 17:41:34 You're following the wrong people if you thought 5k could be any sort of bottom.
2957 2018-12-13 17:41:21 Crypto has a lot of services yet to come online. 
There's an entire social aspect being overlooked as well. 
Fundamentally, we want to make money. We also are here for the tech. 
And then, we're here to build the new society... Ching ching
2958 2018-12-13 17:41:15 How are we gonna use daps? What can we use #daps for?
2959 2018-12-13 17:41:07 Does anyone else think the wealth distribution in crypto is a problem? In fiat the top 1% is the super rich. In crypto the 1% is anyone with some btc. So the 1% richest of that 1% with btc is a ridiculously small % of people yet they hold so much of this supposed "world currency"
2960 2018-12-13 17:40:55 Lessons from 2018 Crypto Market:

Confidence in my own analysis. 

Market Cycles. 

Be patient with your trades. 

Knowing when NOT to trade is just as important as knowing when to.

The power in sharing your opinion. 

Accumulate. #Bitcoin #Crypto #Forex #Trading
2961 2018-12-13 17:40:47 Your story couldn't be more real.

Almost all the guys I know from #crypto have similar stories this last year.

However your last comment is most poignant of all.

"Money made little difference to happiness."

2970 2018-12-13 17:39:41 Starting to look like a floor is being established and resistance to the bulls decreasing. The extended crypto bargain sale may be almost over.
2971 2018-12-13 17:39:14 Thats sad considering the base reason anybody invested in crypto in the first place was to get rich quick. Money should never be a motivator to improve your life.....

2973 2018-12-13 17:39:07 @RobinhoodApp when will New York get crypto?
2974 2018-12-13 17:39:06 It’s a bad time for crypto projects whose promoters are just focused on shilling their coins. It’s an awesome time for crypto projects who are solving real pain points of users, developers and rest of the community. For e.g. @ThunderProtocol has been laser focused on DApp devs.
2975 2018-12-13 17:39:05 That makes no sense

2981 2018-12-13 17:38:17 What difference does it make? Are you really asking that? The *courts* are the ones that define the laws. The SEC are the ones enforcing them. Do you have any evidence of price manipulation? Beyond general short term crypto whale movements?

2987 2018-12-13 17:37:48 Blockchains don't necessarily reflect the actual order of transactions/events, but an *agreed* order of transactions/events. So, not actual truth, but agreed truth according to the system's rules. 

Thoughts? #blockchain #crypto
2988 2018-12-13 17:37:26 In the next 120 days, I think we can see some movement in crypto . Believe there will be good bulls run 
2989 2018-12-13 17:37:17 If #Bitcoin #Crypto continues to fall and or if goes to zero then $AMD $NVDA great shorts
2990 2018-12-13 17:36:43 And Funny enough, the market is in a way dictated by the people’s opinion
2991 2018-12-13 17:36:42 Yeah go figure, they even got into selling Crypto which is the anti-bank currency and still followed suit, just shows you when in Rome.
2992 2018-12-13 17:36:39 Though I admit, a guy who unironically has a "reddit tier avatar" and literally calls himself crypto conservative calling me a leftist and insinuating that BPS has leftists being sent after him (by some reddit cabal of progressives?) does tickle my pickle.
2993 2018-12-13 17:36:35 Can you feel in the air??? Crypto is about to shock the world    #crytotakeover #cryptocurrencynews #CryptoNews #cryptoexchange #apollocurrency
2994 2018-12-13 17:36:15 True, it's probably also their ability to properly assess the startups/projects in the space. Those VCs you mentioned have been in this industry for a few years and see the long term potential. The ones that came for the party last year are likely not here to stay.

2998 2018-12-13 17:35:56 Ripple with total supply is 100 billion xrp, 2017 price for 1xrp only 0.006 dollars. So far XRP prices are always higher than 0.1 usd. Nexty (NTY) with modern technology with 180 billion NTY currently at $ 0.0001USD 1NTY. This is a good opportunity to invest #btc #nty #eth
2999 2018-12-13 17:35:50 Is Bloomberg’s coverage of crypto in-depth, un-sensationalist and objectively informative? @crypto @business
3000 2018-12-13 17:35:43 Can we stop using the word 'crypto' to refer to cryptocurrencies? It is quite annoying.

3002 2018-12-13 17:35:41 Why do you want to know out of interest?
3003 2018-12-13 17:35:15 If you read this from a Bitcoin maximalist perspective, it is saying that "crypto" i.e. shitcoins are dead. It does not say that Bitcoin is dead. Anyone else pick up on this?
3004 2018-12-13 17:35:06 I'll throw my hat in the ring for @Spectrecoin too. My only real HODL aside from Bitcoin

3006 2018-12-13 17:34:57 How ironic, crypto enthusiasts waiting for governments to regulate this space.. These are the same people that put us up with terrible management of the money supply!! Very high inflation and the overall damage done that far outweigh any positives #BTC #crypto #decentralize

3014 2018-12-13 17:34:13 Was discussing this on a call last night. It’s not a completely improbable outcome but I’ve learned speaking in absolutes seldom works out well. We’ll have to wait and see. This isn’t the first bear market in crypto but there are new factors that can influence what happens next
3015 2018-12-13 17:34:07 If you are exchange with bitcoin or eth, you will find that it is very slow and very costly to transfer. Do not worry about that because there are Nexty. Great platform for great technology. Learn about Nexty to see its greatness #crypto #nexty #bitcoin

3023 2018-12-13 17:33:04 They'd need to make more enough than 3% on their customer's deposits to cover operating costs. Conceivable, but suspect. Most bank fees are either nickel and diming customers or passing on other entities' fees.

All the crypto talk isn't reassuring either.

3057 2018-12-13 17:28:26 ...markets have shown to be crazy wrong multiple times. But after some time they always correct themselves (other than inferior forms of organization). So regarding our Cryptothing you have to have strong conviction and liquidity to get there…:)
3058 2018-12-13 17:28:25 I always wanted an electronic currency that really changed  world. I think Nexty can do it perfectly. With unprecedented technology in other cryptographic coin. Nexty will be a great choice for long term investors #crypto #nexty #bitcoin
3059 2018-12-13 17:28:10 Nexty (NTY) was launched in late 2017 by two co-founders CEO Keng Zeng and CTO Thanh Dao. Two good leaders, great vision and always looking towards to the future. So far, Nexty has grown up with many large communities. Join now for great investment opportunities #crypto #nexty
3060 2018-12-13 17:28:06 Just ridiculous people see these tweets from Justin as “providing a bright future”. If you put blockchain and crypto aside, any CEO doing that type of comparison doesn’t look good.
3061 2018-12-13 17:28:04 I didn't listen to crypto "experts" who don't understand about markets, I sold and kept getting attacked for "not getting it, this time it's different" "being pessimistic". Even after being right rhe wrekt keep believing lies and attaching anyone with common sense.

3081 2018-12-13 17:25:20 Wow it gets so difficult to buy crypto from India and price on wazirx of bitcoin is trading at a premium of around 45k. India is killing innovation which might have a negative effect in the coming days.
3082 2018-12-13 17:25:19 The electronic money market is falling deeply. But Nexty's prices are still stable, even up from last week. This proves that people have a lot of belief in Nexty and I think the future is not very far, Nexty can replace bitcoin. #crypto #nexty #bitcoin

3085 2018-12-13 17:25:01 Same question! What will you do when the market goes down. For me, I will buy Nexty (NTY), which is the best platform ever. It will help you get back what you have lost #crypto #nexty #bitcoin
3086 2018-12-13 17:24:36 yes
3087 2018-12-13 17:24:22 The cryptographic market is unpredictable due to price fluctuations and in addition, outdated technology. With Nexty, you'll experience great features along with a stable price system that keeps prices steady at a certain level.

3100 2018-12-13 17:22:51 Really enjoyed this episode. Everyone from @coinbase that comes on your show is so well spoken and intelligent. It’s not reason why they’re at the forefront in crypto.
3101 2018-12-13 17:22:48 çok iyi
3102 2018-12-13 17:22:47 makes perfect sense... when bitcoin was that high there was no need to spend 10k trying to make money in a tourny cause all the profits were rolling in with crypto, now when the money isnt doubling every month it makes perfect sense for those same people to start playingmore
3103 2018-12-13 17:22:46 the number of #crypto users increased from 17 million in a 2017 to 35 million in 2018.

Despite a bearish year, the number of cryptocurrency users seems to be on the rise

3107 2018-12-13 17:21:55 You often have trouble with eth, bitcoin on slow and expensive transfers, now you no longer worry about that anymore. The Nexty platform with great technology, is a product of intelligence with zero cash transfers and fast cash transfers . #crypto #nexty #bitcoin

3119 2018-12-13 17:19:33 It is not that they forgot but they didn't care about the tech from the start. I have spoken to people invested in crypto and what i learned is that a lot of them don't even know the fundamentals of the projects they invested in. They only look at charts.

3121 2018-12-13 17:19:14 Just like clockwork #ETH now  pulling back and testing support on that line.
3122 2018-12-13 17:18:59 In the last past 24h Hours $TNS has gone up 62.12%, hope this trend continues!!! #Cryptocurrency #Crypto #blockchain #altcoin #cryptolife #bitcointalk #decentralized
3123 2018-12-13 17:18:47 Many calling for $1200-$1800. There will be many buyers sub $3k so it’s anyone’s guess. We haven’t retraced from big drop. While I agree going against popular opinion is usually good, most will be knife catching if we drop & it will be quicker & more crowded than most anticipate

3125 2018-12-13 17:18:34 Thank you. Same goes for you 
3126 2018-12-13 17:18:31 Sounds like the “Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin” gambit is over. Does this mean you are creating a new crypto? Leaving the BCH thing behind?

3132 2018-12-13 17:17:56 Been there, done that.

Except mine was $6,500 to $2.8m to #rekt. Wrote a story on it, but removed it for professional reasons.

As for the drug overdose stuff n blah blah blah. Been through that before $crypto.

As Dory says, just gotta #KeepOnSwimming.

Thanks for sharing.

3134 2018-12-13 17:17:24 Who the fuck you think that will sell btc at that price?:)) you are even in the crypto market? The wales takes like 200k of BTC out of echanget at 6 k, that was the big acumulation zone, now is a medium one betwen the 3.3 and 4,3, and a short one with spikes at 2.6 S.O.S BRAIN!

3153 2018-12-13 17:15:26 To get rich on the next bull run. Right? This also leads me to think its gonna have to be something else other than BTC. It only makes sense.
3154 2018-12-13 17:15:16 Instant transfer for 2 seconds with 1800tps. Is not it great ? Look at bitcoin when you take over an hour to get them and with eth is over 10 minutes  #crypto#nexty #bitcoin #BTC #NTY #Coin #nty

3157 2018-12-13 17:14:56 @mappopk_crypto thanks for good project - great job !
3158 2018-12-13 17:14:53 sigh. bitcoin and crypto are on two very different abstraction levels. wallets and addresses are two very different metrics. these people couldn’t report the weather, in their location, while standing outside.
3159 2018-12-13 17:14:50 Then buy more 
3160 2018-12-13 17:14:50 That caught me off guard in a hilarious way
3161 2018-12-13 17:14:46 Totally agree, cards are on the way out. This is one step closer to being able to use crypto holdings in RH at Point-of-Sale. Are you meaning they should optimize toward [RFID/QR] for method of payment or Fiat/Credit/etc for medium of payment of the future?

3173 2018-12-13 17:13:51 javvy proposes its crypto solution for users to overcome all barriers to adoption with a regulation-first approach, defining a carefully crafted business infrastructure and multi-tiered, risk-mitigation policy. 
@javvycrypto
3174 2018-12-13 17:13:41 Sure, so use money to solve the things that can, so you can focus on the things that can’t.
3175 2018-12-13 17:13:27 Thanks buddy! I’m Happy to hear it’s all working out for you.  That’s great!
3176 2018-12-13 17:13:22 Nexty is a blockchain platform for ecommerce, retail and billing. With a large supply of up to $ 180 billion NTY, it is well suited to pay for cheap items without any incidents with fast money transfer and no money transfer fees. #crypto#nexty #bitcoin #BTC #NTY #Coin #nty

3178 2018-12-13 17:13:18 Yes wrong. It could go even lower
3179 2018-12-13 17:13:11 "So what are we to make of my ban? The only sensible conclusion is that Twitter is run by a coterie of #crypto-fascists."
@Twitter needs to take a stand and boldly state in their statement of principles they are opposed to crypto-fascism (something to do with #Bitcoins, I dunno).

3182 2018-12-13 17:13:01 The Nexty platform will give you the opportunity to get rich even when the market goes down. With zero transfers fee and instant cash transfers, it eliminates any obstacles along the way. A bright future awaits you ahead. Let's go #crypto#nexty #bitcoin #nty
3183 2018-12-13 17:12:45 The market is going down dramatically. You should consider investing in a good project to avoid losing your money. I came here to introduce people to the Nexty platform. It's really great with reward programs, commissions for investors. You should join immediately io #crypto #nty
3184 2018-12-13 17:12:44 If they wanted a 5x, they should be buying GEcoin, hot new crypto heard all the "tuts" are buying it. No way you can loose
3185 2018-12-13 17:12:35 I’m not sure I really believe the “crypto mining wears out hardware” thing.

I run the clusters for a large London university and we have hundreds of servers, tens of thousands of CPU cores and tens of GPUs running flat out 24/7.
3186 2018-12-13 17:12:34 I have a theory. Im a nobody so this will probably fall on deaf ears. Over the past few years the amount of BTC/ETH that has been hacked/stolen is outrageous. It leads me to think that the powers that be which allow btc to continue to exist dont want a whole bunch of criminals
3187 2018-12-13 17:12:28 What is the Nexty platform(NTY)? Does anyone know about this platform? Over the last few days, I've seen a lot of media talk about this platform. And I also explored it, at first I was very excited, can be a very good project to invest  #crypto #nexty #nty
