Pros buy Stocks, that provide Dividends—At Specific Pullbacks in Price. Then Takes “Some” Profits, into Large Gains in Price, then Waits for the Next Pullback—And Buys More. 
The Pro’s—Cost Basis, is FAR Less.

Why can't I simply purchase stocks myself?

47 2018-07-31 23:37:35 Don't sell stocks in the morning.
48 2018-07-31 23:37:25 A (simplistic) take is that Einhorn has basically been long low P/E stocks (like $GM) and short high P/E stocks (like $NFLX). Einhorn is very smart, and a great investor, but shorting solely on valuation in a very bullish market is a path to ruin. Momentum factor is real.
49 2018-07-31 23:36:25 I’m not one for stock picks, especially penny stocks, but check the news out on SBRT. I have no position,  but am coming over through the merger. 

The company is the first IoT spectrum provider pureplay, and the goal is to be on the Nasdaq by the end of the yr
50 2018-07-31 23:35:55 I personally don’t do options. Options are a different ball game than buying and selling stocks which is what I do.
51 2018-07-31 23:35:22 2 technology stocks plummeted on Tuesday:
$IPGP -26.9%, $VRNS -16.9%
52 2018-07-31 23:35:14 You're all over it now. Fed's priorities in order:
#1 Bonds - keeping yields low
#2 Stocks - pumping them higher
#3 Dollar
When it becomes a choice of 2 out of 3, it's obvious which they'll sacrifice. Say hello to #QE infinity.
53 2018-07-31 23:34:49 That pick fits the liberal agenda. Be smart about this and the company stocks will comeback. Try being in the middle.
54 2018-07-31 23:34:32 Giving unfunded tax cuts to corporations w/preexisting cond of record profits who used it to buy back own stocks no help to 1/2 country w/no investments & preexisting health conditions GOP trying to take ins away for to pay for trillion + rung up on national deficit indefensible.
55 2018-07-31 23:32:25 Longs.
This says nothing about the value of the business. Heavily shorted stocks are somewhat easy to squeeze. The big OOTM call options buy at the offer was the red flag for me.
56 2018-07-31 23:31:53 The five suspected of looting #CarrFire homes should be put in stocks outside City Hall... I'd buy pies to throw in their faces!
57 2018-07-31 23:30:55 Futures have gone red after reports of raising tariffs on China yet again. Looks like right when the Chinese stocks were set to soar, the orange man strikes again.
58 2018-07-31 23:30:40 What a liar and a idiot. Trump's taxcuts has already paid for by 88%. 50% of the market are people like you and me who have a few stocks and IRAs put back as retirement & 17% of the market are non-profit organizations. So actually only 33% are owned by the rich.
59 2018-07-31 23:29:11 When that check from your stocks come in >>>>>> I don’t deserve this life
60 2018-07-31 23:29:04 Yes ; Make America Great Again . And let’s get the STOCKS moving upwards .. God Bless the USA  .
61 2018-07-31 23:28:55 I’d short energy stocks. You could heat New England through nuclear winter with all the warm fuzzy feelings we’d get from passing this law.
62 2018-07-31 23:28:05 Their stock tanked today to a new low of 1.19

A good buy if your risk threshold is penny-stocks and you believe Jesus answers prayers.

64 2018-07-31 23:26:39 I'm not going to say who, but someone wrote an article yesterday about how this would be a good investment along with 2 other cloud stocks. I couldn't believe it when I read it.
65 2018-07-31 23:24:41 Love it! All these liberals trying to discredit a simple painting LOL! The only thing I can critique is they should all have ARs with bump stocks and 3D printed hand guns !!
66 2018-07-31 23:24:05 Alot of others saying the young guys coming through is adequate cover yet i disagree, we need a general like North, Devere and Pappa are neither imo, nigro O toole bowles and pepper are all in the same boat to, there is no stand out leader in the defensive stocks imo
67 2018-07-31 23:23:55 Yes. You just don't have $1 mm in liquid assets. Another number you can look at is the number of ppl with $1mm in liquid assets (stocks, bonds, cash) Some googling should find that.
68 2018-07-31 23:23:35 Q: If we created 3 index funds or baskets of stocks – PowerApp(Ty, Bay, Sam), CrapApp(Fessy, Rach, Hay), and the Field(Scottie, RS, Angela, KC, JC, Brett) which would you most interested in purchasing? Prices would be the sum (or some proportional sum) of the people in group.
69 2018-07-31 23:23:24 I got my mom into buying stocks on Stash. She just bought stocks in Amazon and Netflix!
70 2018-07-31 23:21:51 What was really behind FB losing so much in stocks in one day?
71 2018-07-31 23:21:04 I think it was a way to hide funds. If he got cash and spent cash then it is hard for the gov't to track. He spent on goods and services as an investment. If it had gone into a bank account or stocks he would have to pay the taxes.
72 2018-07-31 23:20:59 FACT: Worker pay in the second quarter dropped nearly one percent below its first-quarter level.

FACT: Wages fell 1.4 percent from 2017, effecting 80% of industries & 2/3 of metro areas affected.

FACT: Worker wages drop while companies spend $700 billion to boost stocks
73 2018-07-31 23:20:12 Restrictions on ammo sales (like Switzerland), the guy who murdered dozens in Vegas was able to stockpile thousands of 223 rounds, why?
Bans on modifications like bump stocks, no gun should fire hundreds of rounds a minute should be on the civilian market

Some of my stances
74 2018-07-31 23:20:02 Trump put a ban on American made Bump Stocks, but now with a 3-D printer you can make a machine gun. I hope that the guy who thought of this has his family shot up with what he made.
75 2018-07-31 23:19:53 there stocks keep going down as they go after conservatives and republicans running for office.This will keep going as more people are joining to come up with there own social media page just for conservatives and republican.Democrats can keep face book

80 2018-07-31 23:16:52 whats the point of buying stocks then
81 2018-07-31 23:15:06 yup, my haters are just such fucken morons, their ignorance pumps me up to teach more..some .people still think it's illegal to short penny stocks
82 2018-07-31 23:13:59 Plenty of women take estrogen, those born without ovaries or with malformed ovaries take it, because they have to. Some have normal ovaries but insufficient estrogen levels. There are other reasons. But it's so many women every pharmacy stocks multiple formulations of estrogen.
83 2018-07-31 23:13:05 What you mean?  Central banks told us stocks only go up

93 2018-07-31 23:05:23 I have come to the conclusion that stocks in this sector moves for multitude of reasons and least for the right ones :)  if you review EV/S ratios - the top most should be $TRST $OGI $APH - But they aren’t ...hence the term “Speculative” with capital S
94 2018-07-31 23:05:07 5. #Apple- iPhone sales: 41.3 million vs. 41.79 million, according to StreetAccount #stocks #earnings #StocksToWatch
95 2018-07-31 23:04:23 I own stocks so it will obviously benefit me. But capital gains are earned *far and away* more by those who earn more than $100k per year than those who earn less. Your personal anecdote is trite.
96 2018-07-31 23:03:48 Damnit trump leave my stocks alone
97 2018-07-31 23:03:43 4. #Apple - Revenue: $53.3 billion vs. $52.34 billion, according to Thomson Reuters consensus estimates #stocks #earnings #StocksToWatch
98 2018-07-31 23:03:16 Is GDP accurate? When will the yield curve invert? Quick shake-out or more weakness to come? Will SPY hit new highs next week? Do stocks need a rest? Is gold a buy now?

The beauty of trend following is you never need to ask or answer dumb questions.
99 2018-07-31 23:02:53 @realDonaldTrump don’t you dare take credit for the temporary ban on blueprints of 3D guns,you just chimed in today!

102 2018-07-31 23:01:28 They need to do more to preserve the ever declining wild atlantic salmon stock.  As a fisherman it saddens me the way our wild fish stocks are declining. Time to ban commercial netting & encourage angling clubs to implement catch and release policy.
103 2018-07-31 23:01:19 I appreciate your kindness and your reply. While there aren’t any stocks left, do u think you’ll revive some of your limited editions if there’s a great demand someday? 
And on the same note, thank u for amazing coffee and coffee-ware products
104 2018-07-31 23:00:31 LOL...clown the bulls for 6 months of consolidation...that is what it has come to for bears...that and tech stocks giving back 20% of a 1,000% gain

When we get the bear market we have been promised since 2011 the bears will be insufferable
105 2018-07-31 23:00:27 52%/54% if adults own stocks. Msm/dems would have us believe it’s only the rich. Younger people are a very small %. My experience working with young people, they simply have no perspective, they are young - same with insurance, cash savings
106 2018-07-31 23:00:10 2. #Apple- The 41.3 million iPhones shipped during the third quarter is basically flat from the year-ago period, but the ASP(Average Selling Price) of $724 is a notable jump. #earnings #stocks #StocksToWatch

108 2018-07-31 22:59:26 I don’t understand it, either.  I’ve said on line for years it’s the only way those without much money can build money.  I had low  income, inherited a few thousand dollars in the early nineties.  Studied, Researched  my own stocks. Quadrupled $, saved it.

Consider starting a #lotto watchlist of stocks you like & watch for unusual volume, taps or accumulation as sometimes they could possibly lead to movements.

Stay up-to-date with the dd on the stocks you like as a stock's variables can change at anytime.
116 2018-07-31 22:53:58 As its end month, aside from a couple of exceptions, I'll look at stocks on the monthly candle charts... for some perspective.
117 2018-07-31 22:51:48 @SublimeTrades also because he’s shorting things that aren’t actually shortable in REAL trading. These penny stocks he’s shorting like $AWX have very few shares to short at very specific times, not 5-20k shares whenever you want. Paper trading unlimited borrows
118 2018-07-31 22:51:39 Good luck sir. 

I'm terrible at picking tops and bottoms so I really have no opinion.

I treat individual stocks like slot machines...  Looking for mistakes. 

I don't know how to do that with indexes, so I cost average.
119 2018-07-31 22:51:21 $GOOGL beat big and stocks still sold off. Been watching, lots of funds seem to be rebalancing tech after $FB. Wouldn't be surprised if we see it fall again despite big beat here.

127 2018-07-31 22:43:33 Why? Look at the revenue TenCent Holdings generates and the busineesses that it is in. It makes the same money Facebook and Apple do every quarter yet only trades at $45.50....those other stocks are 4x as higher!

130 2018-07-31 22:41:45 My friend just called me a 40 year old for investing in stocks, sorry I’m trying to invest in my future so by the time I’m 40 I can retire and enjoy my savings 
131 2018-07-31 22:40:55 On highly volatile stocks (basically all pot stocks) you pay a premium for the option that is lost as time goes on. The rate of value loss due to time increases the closer you get to expiration. There’s a lot to learn and not a lot of room on Twitter. Good luck! (3/3)
132 2018-07-31 22:40:12 I want to learn more about stocks and investing to have have a lavish life after retirement lol

134 2018-07-31 22:39:01 A judge has already stopped the release of the blue prints. I know my civics thank you. Congress could have banned bump stocks and didn't. They could ban this too.
135 2018-07-31 22:37:28 Do bump stocks increase the gun's rate of fire?

I'm not quibbling over semantics.  If the answer is yes, then they should be banned.
136 2018-07-31 22:34:57 Yep, not being researched THOROUGHLY has caused me to lose money in stocks but honest & thorough research, has for the main part, made me money. The caveate was then knowing when to come in & then out...
137 2018-07-31 22:34:09 Anti gun and non informed people have no idea that you are allowed, since America has been founded, to build your own gun In your home (non nfa weapons).

140 2018-07-31 22:33:15 Read through their past articles, you’ll see dozens of different opinions on the same stocks.  @themotleyfool is no more credible than a joe blow like me.  However, I think Aphria will do just fine into legalization.  Best of luck with it. 
141 2018-07-31 22:31:33 Bump stocks don't "convert" them to autos, they just mimic full auto. And you can't really ban that without banning the concept of semiautomatic. And "mag" sizes don't matter. Limiting them won't stop criminals from getting bigger mags. You can make your own. The rest I agree
142 2018-07-31 22:30:08 Why is that when #hospice care re-enters your lexicon, things like #Aeromexico crash, @AppleSupport stocks ...none of that really matters b/c I know the world is losing a beautiful #soul

You are not in the military, why do you need an ARM. Also, commas come after a word. If that is bias, nothing is true

150 2018-07-31 22:26:14 I don't recommend or apply momentum to the stocks in the acquirer's multiple screens. I doubt it works on net nets given they are few and far between and typically deeply depressed.

152 2018-07-31 22:25:09 I’m not poor, I’m also not rich. There are tons of middle class people like me who make between 75,000 and 200,000 a year who are invested in the stock market, especially since 2016 Dec. Pensioners own stocks as well.
153 2018-07-31 22:25:05 i don't understand how this isn't an SEC investigation. Facebook is refusing to even reveal the full scope of this publicly, and all indications are that it's out of fear of backlash to their stocks. Seems like investor fraud to me.

171 2018-07-31 22:11:05 The biggest problem for Apple is valuation. The1999-2000 economy was booming (better than today),unemployment was low. But tech stocks were overvalued. Money tightened&stocks with warts fell 1st-others later. Now FB&NFLX(with warts)pummeled. AMZN&GOOG (no warts) roll over. Apple?

227 2018-07-31 21:34:23 It’s tricky. In hyperinflation stocks will outperform bonds. Yes. Crack up boom. But a generic bond bear will be bad for both.

249 2018-07-31 21:26:26 I can honestly tell you I didn't buy any stocks today.

I was tempted to buy $ABT which has a nice breakout, but then I thought how much this market sucks right now.

So I didn't.

251 2018-07-31 21:24:15 The corporate buyback boost, which some investors believe has helped stabilize the stocks market during a rocky stretch.
252 2018-07-31 21:23:58 It’s just inflation indexing capital gains.  It helps everyone that is invested in stocks.
253 2018-07-31 21:23:56 Yeah handle that as well as you handled the bump stocks tough guy
254 2018-07-31 21:23:47 TBH, if this country does collapse into violent revolution, it would be Newt's fatty jowls to be the first ones squeezed into the guillotine stocks for what he devised 25 years ago, and there's actually not much debate over that. He's the clear archvillain in our current story.
255 2018-07-31 21:23:27 I'd suggest there'd be a lot of donations he'd need to be in the stocks a few days as he'd be a popular target  nasty little boy
256 2018-07-31 21:22:27 @Apple repurchased $20.8 billion of its stocks in the 2Q

258 2018-07-31 21:21:00 @Apple big buybacks are underpinning the record spree of shareholders returns in the stocks market
259 2018-07-31 21:20:52 John, forgive my directness here but are you for real? How do you tell someone to go buy stocks when the majority of Americans cant afford healthcare, education & basic amenities? #GOPTaxScam

DoubleLine's Gundlach agrees: threat of tariffs have pulled economic growth forward, so growth in future quarters will be weaker 
Short-maturity US Treasuries look as good relative to stocks & long bonds

263 2018-07-31 21:20:13 Market Close: MBS +9bps; DOW +108.36; NASDAQ +41.78; S&P 500 +13.69; 10yr Treasury 2.96%; Stocks close in the Green, but off of earlier highs, as they await earnings from Apple.  MBS closes in positive territory, as well.

265 2018-07-31 21:19:55 Lol...... Also in the real world inflated stocks just got dumped into the market causing a lag. But hey I'm sure the new round of tax cuts will help the average worker right?
266 2018-07-31 21:19:54 How dare you! I could win an election in my sleep whilst reading upside down. I coulda sworn you had two stocks only due to Brexit fears. Hmmmm. You're not in cohoots with market makers are you? They kept refusing me trades today.
267 2018-07-31 21:19:41 Going on and on for decades. Millions being wasted by both side. It a wasteful government thing. Obama on track to be the most expensive ex- President in history.$1,153,000 in 2018! You got the numbers on BOH rallies? Meanwhile Trump donates his salary.
268 2018-07-31 21:19:31 I think big boy tech added token dividends years/decades ago so institutions that could only own dividend paying stocks could buy them.   I could be wrong.  Memory hole.

270 2018-07-31 21:17:38 Investors: Buy HEAVY into stocks for Sheila G's Brownie Brittle.  I'm not even sure if they are part of a publicly traded company, I just know I can't stop buying it.
271 2018-07-31 21:16:15 I stick to what I know, use & understand with the odd wildcard. Spotting trends e.g. Disney acquiring Star Wars & Disney, cable-cutting (Netflix) gaming stocks (TTWO, ATVI, EA) and cornerstone stuff Amazon , FB, TWTR etc. I don’t buy weapon stocks though on principle.
272 2018-07-31 21:15:46 What does this have to do with the trade issue? Trump hasn't done anything that affects job openings. The only legislation that was passed was a tax breaks for huge corporations that they used to buy back their stocks, not increase wages & workforce.
273 2018-07-31 21:15:45 I was... way too old when I realized it wasn't really normal to have a metal lathe in your basement. We did, and for exactly this purpose. Gramps taught himself (an utterly terrifying, ballsy notion) and was a licensed dealer. Grew up w/ barrels & stocks in the basement rafters.
274 2018-07-31 21:15:06 Im gonna do a thread for you guys later on stocks and shares. I did one on credit.. ill RT that so you can read it before you read this coming one.
275 2018-07-31 21:14:31 I'd recommend speaking to Google if bought from them. Mine was out of warranty, did the same, they sent me a new one. A while back mind so not sure what stocks are like but customer service has always been excellent.
276 2018-07-31 21:14:01 Far out, that's an absolute rort. Imagine if one were to say.. package all transactions together for one fee, or better yet a monthly sub brokerage and you get better/unlimited access to US stocks.

291 2018-07-31 21:08:47 This is great news thanks for advising John, now hopefully we will see Global X URA recover some lost ground circa 20% and this will also provide a good base line for stocks within the index. Now I am looking forward to all URA holdings increasing.
292 2018-07-31 21:08:43 Buying some $AAPL stocks tomorrow. Truely amazing profit increase!
293 2018-07-31 21:07:54 only if it fits within my criteria. for example i dont by stocks that do less then 1M in volume and under 15% for that given day. many first green days might only do 500k in volume and 10% on that day ( I dont touch those).
294 2018-07-31 21:06:53 First off the church needs to stay the fuck out of my government.

Third, fuck off. I know I have helped more drug addicts than the church.

298 2018-07-31 21:05:39 Price wasn't my first argument.  
Just because it's speculative doesn't mean it's bad.  Gold is.  Stocks are. Even currencies are (derivatives).
299 2018-07-31 21:04:45 When stocks (and the industry around them) make the switch to blockchains, you can make more sense with that approach.

What we've had for the last 10 years are not securities as you portray them. So the whole industry, and all its accomplished so far, including value, stands.

318 2018-07-31 20:59:15 I’m pretty sure the one with a boat was just very popular on stocks for some time and photographers wanted to make a profit from it. The same happens with fonts, when some specific style becomes popular quite a number of designers try to imitate it to get their piece of pie.

329 2018-07-31 20:53:51 People ignored Obama's huge misses because we liked him. 

Truth is black wealth plummeted under his reign.  Inner city education systems remained awful or got worse.  Inner city crime rose. 

What got better under Obama?  Rich people's stocks and real estate.
330 2018-07-31 20:53:50 Absolutely! I use @RobinhoodApp as well to short with puts. It’s the same as trading “penny” stocks on the premium pricing. I bot $FB and $TSLA for less then $5 on the slide. The app does a great job of letting you see the percentage gain and loss.

FACT: Wages fell 1.4 percent from 2017, effecting 80% of industries 

FACT: Worker wages drop while companies spend $700 billion to boost stocks

353 2018-07-31 20:43:08 Genius design, Someone can lose a SR spot overnight, so SR's will compete for votes with rewards forever.  This is better than a 401k, better than a CD and better than high yield stocks.   And soon torrent seeders will be paid in TRON also.  It's money making money, compounded.

376 2018-07-31 20:33:36 Really? I've just asked them why they don't apply for more beaver introduction licences so that they can improve fish stocks rather than classify natural predation as a nuisance. Don't suppose for a minute they'll reply.
377 2018-07-31 20:33:20 Hope you right. And strange stuff can happen with small stocks. But action today was disappointing
378 2018-07-31 20:33:15 The top five stocks that closed higher today were $ILMN, $KLAC, $HRS, $XLY, and $APTV.
379 2018-07-31 20:32:18 The top five most active stocks today were $AMD, $GE, $TWTR, $BAC, and $PFE.

382 2018-07-31 20:29:45 My only point was that Wall Street is conditioned to equate "good" stocks to higher prices but everyone knows you're supposed to buy low and sell high if u wanna make money.
383 2018-07-31 20:27:17 a lot of stocks have gone down in price.. probably been sent a notification to persuade you to buy them.. Doesnt seem to make sense though because Spotify stocks are up 3.5%..
384 2018-07-31 20:27:03 Or if not .... do you have stocks?
385 2018-07-31 20:26:17 Lmao don’t. I just ended up having a job that does the 401K for me and my grandfather did the stocks
386 2018-07-31 20:26:16 I wouldn't, but I'm not a billionaire who depends on the government to the extent that the NFL owners do. Do you really not understand how Trump's words affect things? Stocks have been rising and falling based on his tweets since he came into office.

396 2018-07-31 20:20:30 World stocks higher: US +.5%; Europe +.2%. Hints of a thaw in the US-China trade war spurred markets. However, its a long way from a done deal so investors should be cautious. A quick positive outcome would let investors focus on 2Q's strong earnings. 2018 still looking positive.
397 2018-07-31 20:20:18 Stocks rise. The Dow closed at 25,415.19, up 108.36 (+0.43%). Nasdaq +0.55%. S&P +0.49%.

399 2018-07-31 20:19:22 One day the stock markets going to crash any minute then the next day stocks are on the rise - just pick right and sit tight.
400 2018-07-31 20:19:01 Mainly something that will have legs for the next day. And the stocks that tend to have legs have some sort catalyst, are trending up EOD, above #VWAP, and that fits my general criteria for what type of stocks I like to play.
401 2018-07-31 20:17:58 Cool, well why didn’t you include that in your original response? You could have said the United States has an AR-15’s with bump stocks problem. But you didn’t because even that is false when you compare the number of murders that have been committed using an AR with a bump stock
402 2018-07-31 20:17:43 There’s this really shitty idea re: stocks where people think that having x amount of money in stocks means that you’re just sitting on that money & you can touch it whenever you want
403 2018-07-31 20:17:03 U.S. stocks closed higher Tuesday,07/31/18. $DJIA +0.43% at 25,415.19, $SPX +0.49% at 2,816.29, $COMPQ +0.55% at 7,671.79, $RUT +1.06% at 1670.71.
404 2018-07-31 20:16:25 I may be wrong but lower receivers are the controlled components of firearms, right?

Like you can buy handles and barrels and stocks all you want, but lower receivers are tracked. 

So you could buy as many of the *other* things you want and just print a lower receiver at home.

426 2018-07-31 20:04:52 1. You said an AR was equivalent to a machine gun. You just stated that it’s not. That was my point. 
2. Bam bump stocks, I could care less. They are useless. 
3. I’m not even going to get into another debate about banning AR’s. It’s pointless.

429 2018-07-31 20:04:08 Wouldn't it make more sense to only have stocks or ETFs that produce pure income in your TFSA, like bonds?  I would think dividends should be in a personal margin account so you have take advantage of the preferential tax treatment for them?

439 2018-07-31 19:59:50 Also, I tend to agree that bump stocks should be banned. They don’t serve any purpose and are not effective whatsoever. That being said it’s still misleading to tell civilians that they are Machine Guns.
440 2018-07-31 19:59:47 You have done a great job with bump stocks and AR-15s.

447 2018-07-31 19:55:45 Of course, they are making money when selling stocks or bonds of large companies, too. Those are really subject to huge (and onerous) transparency requirements, and hidden „soft information“ does not play a significant role.
448 2018-07-31 19:55:33 And then also, In the future, I will also invest more money into my #StockMarket account on @etrade and I also plan on buying more big time stocks that could estimate in getting big time shares/money in the future.

460 2018-07-31 19:49:19 You're clearly not a #ProfessionalEconomist. 

1) Because the equity markets were overvalued and went sideways this year instead of down because #TaxCuts let corporations decrease the supply of stocks, thus, keeping the price relatively high. 

2) they don't any more

3) What?

471 2018-07-31 19:43:14 I know your intent is good, but the real danger is the high capacity magazines, bump stocks, silencers, and poor background checks. A person would be pretty isolated if they couldn’t get a throw away gun in America. This single shot zip gun is just a distraction!
472 2018-07-31 19:43:12 Inflation wreaked havoc with stocks, and home mortgages saw rates in mid-teens, although home prices were carried higher with the inflation in many areas.  (But even 5%-6% mortgage rates today would choke off housing demand like nobody’s business!)

507 2018-07-31 19:30:44 I can completely agree with that...capitalism in its current form..which is basically crony capitalism...sends some of the smartest people off to wall street to go write algorithms that can autospeculate on stocks...that can't possibly be the best use of our brightest minds.

510 2018-07-31 19:29:05 well yeah. people think you can print some untraceable machine gun; in reality you can make a crappy 22 liberator, a crappy 22 that explodes, a crappy non-serial ar15 lower (which you can already buy legally,) or airsoft grade grips and stocks
511 2018-07-31 19:27:30 It’s the equivalent of Twitter trading, bit we’re investors at @realmoney and will assess the fundamentals, tailwinds and valuation - more room to go in several FANG stocks.

513 2018-07-31 19:25:01 used that too =( now i type "my stocks" in google, but would love more information without having to search for it (earnings report dates were really clear on google finance)

522 2018-07-31 19:21:47 Because cbot corn @ 3.80 means we have a disaster ... You are aware if the yield for corn falls below 174 closer to 170 (which is still a great crop) prices will surge above $4 for the season on declining world stocks and strong demand.

525 2018-07-31 19:20:50 @ShepNewsTeam He’s claiming a violation of his right to free speech? OK, I equate this to shouting, “FIRE!” In a crowded Theater!  It doesn’t take a high IQ to see the danger in this! We all were amazed that bump stocks were approved after Vegas, how can we even think about this!
526 2018-07-31 19:20:46 Why keep the twats in jail Bring back stocks so they can be pelted with flour and eggs - make sure the latter have gone bad and keep them there for several days 
527 2018-07-31 19:20:32 I agree with what you're saying, it would change alot but still some fights lead to death. We barely know how to debate, invest in stocks and just the fundamentals but everybody knows how to fight that isn't good man
528 2018-07-31 19:20:12 Actually Walt Disney was a conservative

529 2018-07-31 19:18:45 @PeterSchiff what foreign stocks do you recommend?
530 2018-07-31 19:18:28 Are value investors paying attention? Lots of growth investors fleeing the Chinese stocks. Starting to look juicy: $TCEHY $BABA $JD $CTRP
531 2018-07-31 19:18:22 LGC Free the Cash isn't just about taking small loss. It's taking Profit to maximise the Return on Capital   I see some stocks even in Sell all Profit mode 2018 from Great 2016 Buy. That will do better than Square 72. Any funds that didn't get 40% yr  past 2 yr    LGC 
532 2018-07-31 19:17:58 I used to think that as well. But MGM stocks are down after they decided to sue all the victims from the Las Vegas massacre (in an unconscionable attempt to prevent victims from suing MGM first). Adam Silver & NBA seizing upon this opportunity screams the opposite of integrity.
533 2018-07-31 19:17:33 International?

Uhm most American stocks are owned by Americans with a vast majority held by 401k/IRA's etc.
534 2018-07-31 19:16:45 Mildly positive for bank stocks as they have a higher presence in TOPIX than Nikkei 225.

536 2018-07-31 19:15:52 Hindsight is always 20/20. It’s the same reason you don’t always sell or buy stocks at their respective high/low. It’s not predictable.
537 2018-07-31 19:15:10 We look at all the usual valuation screens to identify stocks that are cheap relative to book value, earnings and cash flow. -- Jon Jacobson
538 2018-07-31 19:15:09 No, just more lies by the left. The capital gain tax cut would be for all. You would only use it when you sell your stock. Most of the rich keep their blue chip stocks for life.
539 2018-07-31 19:15:04 They suspend conservatives for alot less that was said about Rosie O'donnell.  Just sad. But I do enjoy watching Twitter stocks fall daily.

543 2018-07-31 19:13:41 Steffy will already have Bill's FC stocks which is probably what motivated her to marry him in the first place. What more could she possibly want or need from Bill once she has his stocks?

545 2018-07-31 19:13:17 50d MA support on the nasdaq composite holds. Many stocks bounce off their 50d MAs as well thus providing a logical entry if that is part of ones trading method. $AAPL will report today after the close.
546 2018-07-31 19:12:21 I bet more Americans are murdered each year by illegals than by 3D printed bump stocks.
547 2018-07-31 19:12:10 What ATL tokens are not?
ATL tokens are not stocks or shares, nor are they an issue prospectus or an offer document, they were not created to gather funds.
ATL tokens were not created for trading, they do not represent debt or a company instrument.

Truth is that the FANG stocks are suspicious in the first place, and need to be chopped down so real growth happens.

581 2018-07-31 18:55:12 Thanks Mila! I looked through many stocks this weekend. Most tech names seem to be in consolidative/corrective phases after big advances. Probably will need time to set up again.
582 2018-07-31 18:54:25 I’ve been stock trading since I turned 18. My brokerage account was my birthday gift. Ten years later, I can say that my experience regarding stocks needed a lot of learning when it comes to the crypto market. Learned a shit load as well in the last six months.
583 2018-07-31 18:53:23 Good for you. I don't even know how stocks work  but I know algebra so I'll be more successful.
584 2018-07-31 18:53:16 AAPL heavily weighted in QQQ and reports after close so what QQQ does is dependent on that. We don’t buy indexes only names, we longed the 4 parabolic stocks on that QQQ gap fill however. Good profit so far, holding over night is the debate now. Been bearish QQQ from last week.

591 2018-07-31 18:47:29 Supposed to be done today but Global X remain unpredictable. "destroying" is not really the case as we're looking at a multi-year #uranium bull. "Delaying" response in #U3O8 #stocks has provided fire sale entry prices, so for longs like me, has been something of a blessing. 
592 2018-07-31 18:47:29 $ITA and $DFEN caught my attention today. Nice pattern. Defense #stocks are setting up.
593 2018-07-31 18:46:53 When I wake up I check my stocks
594 2018-07-31 18:44:17 Specifically grain stocks (not like Wall Street street stocks). The numbers 43 and 19 million are measured in tons.
So the grain stocks are on the way from 43 million tons in 2013 to 19 million tons.

597 2018-07-31 18:42:26 It can be because of droughts in countries that make up 60% of rice (and other grains) imports to the US. Those specific countries can see stocks massively drop from 43 million to 19 million. So yes at the moment because that’s the rate this is going.
598 2018-07-31 18:41:31 $GDS $IPGP - Always sell weak stocks. Both sent clear signals to sell before the large down move.

600 2018-07-31 18:41:16 lol, I'm running my beer stocks down pal!!!
601 2018-07-31 18:41:04 That is a wise and prudent move. I also have a SP500 short open and down 9%. With interest rates rising I fully expect a right sizing of stocks so it remains in balance. Leverage will be pulled as too expensive to fund
602 2018-07-31 18:40:46 So would I want in the @USSenate a woman who is guaranteed half the votes because of sex in every endorsement "contest" who now campaigns saying @HillaryClinton lost in 2016 because of @facebook and the "Russians" and talked down social media stocks?? NO. I don't think so. #wcco

610 2018-07-31 18:37:22 Spot on! I'll have to do research to try to find out more info.
I would think that would be considered kick backs. A friend thinks it's due to investments they know the stocks. But I would think that would be a form of insider trading.

624 2018-07-31 18:30:52 It depends on the lengrh of the gamw, the longer the game the less or more stocks you have. Melee had 4 stocks to make it last about 5-10 minutes, brawl three, and smash 4, two. If ultimate plays like melee hopefully itll be three to four.
625 2018-07-31 18:30:17 All the people I see who break a way from the typical 9-5 jobs are in Sales (real estate, cars, pharmaceuticals etc) have a business (service/online) and invest in to other businesses. , stocks, real estate.

634 2018-07-31 18:29:07 Watching your show. Re tax cuts on capital gains.  No, it's not only for the rich.  My income is just under 20K, and I  own stocks.  Sick of hearing everything is only for the wealthy.  #getaclue
635 2018-07-31 18:28:59 But @WynnLasVegas is up 3.4% & @ChurchillDowns 1.5% today, so maybe gaming stocks in general are just doing OK and it has nothing to do with the announcement?
636 2018-07-31 18:28:43 getting close to your pt..
637 2018-07-31 18:27:57 Most people say I'm diversified. I have stocks, mutual funds, 401(k), real estate, etc. But are you diversified? All of it, taxable! Where is the tax free bucket? #WesTheNYLGuy

639 2018-07-31 18:27:29 At the stores I mentioned stocks are often low prior to the offer, or even on the first day! Stores should be aware of the dates of the offer and have extra stock available. So it’s not so much demand outstripping supply but poor stock control in the first place.

They can fly in on a visitors visa, and do lesbian porn like Melania did..and 3D print out weapons.

645 2018-07-31 18:24:53 Markets hate uncertainty. It can drive down stocks. But for a smart trader, its a buying opportunity

648 2018-07-31 18:22:31 That’s why I’m on twitter and also why I shared that I thought $AMD is a multibagger hiding in plain sight. I was an engineer by training but I made most of my money in stocks, the old fashioned, fundamentals approach.

654 2018-07-31 18:19:26 They don't call it the silly season for nothing. Although in these days of QE, rigged markets that regulators do nothing about, and widespread mass delusion about how stocks and housing can only go up in price, seems being silly isn't just a seasonal occurrence any more.

664 2018-07-31 18:15:44 We don't have a counter hypothetical to know what would happen if they weren't buying back their own stock. It's simply inaccurate to posit that the impact of additional demand has a consistent effect across different stocks.

697 2018-07-31 17:58:52 1. You are not correct in the sense not all investors brought those stocks at their IPO thus didn't get burnt by the stock market crash of 2008. At its worst, Transcorp has paid dividends for 2017, Daarcom can't break even.

770 2018-07-31 17:25:46 Ya sure!!  Just seems odd after @facebook stocks fall and everything else that is going on with them that this happens.  Sounds kinda fishy to me.
771 2018-07-31 17:25:46 @jaltucher    Roy Niederhoffer was trying to explain bond prices no longer go up when stocks go down and subject was quickly changed. Can you explain what he meant to say? Thanks
772 2018-07-31 17:24:24 Interesting how stocks dropped so drastically last week...insider trading?
773 2018-07-31 17:23:50 Can say that you atleast tried and give all remaining 155mm ammo stocks to someone who's still fighting. Desides it makes no sense to think you'll be facing them alone, of course not.
774 2018-07-31 17:23:42 @2Yellow9 From ur silence & Preeti mam's advice it seems it is not at all right time to invest in the stocks.. kuch to boliye.. I really admire u

776 2018-07-31 17:21:43 How dare he joke! Throw him in the stocks and pelt him with fair trade tomatoes. That’s it, burn and bury anything to do with ‘python.’ He said ‘words’ about his late friend. Disgusting!

780 2018-07-31 17:19:28 Hey Dan is there a list of the fb pages ol zuk took down? or is it just a ploy to try to keep his stocks for falling?
781 2018-07-31 17:19:22 Another misleading headline. Capital gains money has been taxed along the way already. Why is it that the people that have purchased stocks a long time ago have to pay additional tax due to inflation? The idea that only the 1% buy stocks is silly.
782 2018-07-31 17:18:40 $DRUS L2 isn't looking good! on watch  for now!

Safe guard removed by Citizen United. A ticking Time bomb set to go off> 2016 Elections. Trump used to start Party Warfare. WIN AT ALL COST<
788 2018-07-31 17:16:02 The analyst community - stocks and bonds - has been woefully negligent. So, we will see.

790 2018-07-31 17:13:47 Imran khan Ex wives are repenting now for leaving him .They never knew this man is going to be PM of Pakistan. .
So be patient with your husband and your stocks ....you never know when they will rock.

791 2018-07-31 17:13:00 Anyone who wasn't under a spell who went to buy DAAR stocks then will buy sand in a desert if properly packaged.
792 2018-07-31 17:12:13 Fang stocks will come back. Everytime they fell over the past few years it was a buying opportunity.
793 2018-07-31 17:12:11 Trump never did anything about bump stocks, he's not gonna do anything about this either

798 2018-07-31 17:09:33 Mortgage Bonds modestly higher. Stocks rebounding solidly. 10-yr yield 2.95%.
799 2018-07-31 17:09:22 Sounds like the FBI is working with facebook to get those stocks back up to me........... not stop what we know is non threatening "election meddling". Sounds like the way Fox is peddling this they are trying to help. Fox stop excluding your network when you mention the "MSM".
800 2018-07-31 17:09:19 $SPY Would be cautious potentially chasing some stocks. The only thing we really know at this point is that bulls are willing to buy, lower.

803 2018-07-31 17:08:56 Hi Nicholas, unfortunately the yellow away shirt hasn't been launched yet, but stocks are expected in the near future.
804 2018-07-31 17:08:49 Oh but they'll lose big buckslike last Friday Twitter stocks dropped by 20%.
People don't want this crap going on. 
If they can't be FAIR then let em lose!
805 2018-07-31 17:08:47 Really really want to invest in stocks 
806 2018-07-31 17:08:22 ANnnnnd what u mean by 25 times.
807 2018-07-31 17:08:13 Nice Jim, I was able to catch some fish yesterday myself ie some tech stocks on sale!
808 2018-07-31 17:07:53 A couple of possibilities: 
1. They were drawing from stocks, and could not continue the outflow.
2. They are responding to the ST physical mkt.

814 2018-07-31 17:04:58 When it comes to stocks, “buy the rumor, and sell the news”! My boy stay dropping me gems!! 
815 2018-07-31 17:04:55 Yeah, @JamesRognon was saying they’ve had to barrow money to stay afloat and their stocks are plummeting
816 2018-07-31 17:04:21 What we can safely guess:
1.  Gazillions of $ of stock buybacks will be announced.
2.  "Weak" iPhone sales would still be in the millions
3.  Apparently, none of the 499 other stocks matter today to most traders.

There you go - and I'm not even a paid analyst!
817 2018-07-31 17:04:19 i wanna start investing in the stocks
818 2018-07-31 17:03:06 *goes and stocks up on Walkers crisps immediately*
819 2018-07-31 17:02:39 The stocks then army for ten years. Very lenient.
820 2018-07-31 17:02:28 Rather quiet in FX and indeed stocks at present.. Maybe many waiting to see what Apple earnings do to risk assets later..Their earnings are released after the close.

822 2018-07-31 17:02:04 That's the key...The Rotation/Rollover from the #FANGish stocks into more of the value stocks w/divvies and a promise of some growth -either b/c they've been beaten down, like $T or are in a possible growth sector or have a growth story like $AAPL, $DIS or some of the #Bio stocks
823 2018-07-31 17:01:46 Retweeted Bill Mitchell (@mitchellvii):

Think about this. Twitter and Facebook stocks are dying in a 4.1% GDP economy.

Turns our #censorship is bad for business.
824 2018-07-31 17:01:09 Wow something must have happened yesterday at Twitter...

Today I opened up my account and and had over 50 new followers and 128 notifications... Up from 2-5 followers per day and 12 notifications.

Did REAL AMERICANS kick @jack in the stocks yesterday maybe? Reality bites man...

828 2018-07-31 16:58:16 just got disowned by my cousin for wearing stocks and socks
829 2018-07-31 16:58:10 Are you claiming that the middle class doesn’t own stocks??? Social security is ending. Workers have IRAs and 401ks. How would helping them SOMEDAY be able to retire a bad thing?
830 2018-07-31 16:57:31 ... It means stocks dropped. It's a pun.
831 2018-07-31 16:57:22 @NileshShah68 Imran khan's Ex wives are repenting now for leaving him .They never knew this man is going to be PM of Pakistan. .
So be patient with your husband and your stocks ....you never know when they will rock...a fwd 

832 2018-07-31 16:56:55 Peter, so is every other investable instrument, stocks , bonds, dollars  including beloved Gold and Silver certificates, simple speculation.  Gold and silver are simply BS.  @maxkeiser
833 2018-07-31 16:56:36 All people who own stocks are “wealthy”. Lowering capital gains for idiots who save their money and invest is shameful. Entitled middle class workers with 401ks need to continue working until they die, esp. since social security it dying.
834 2018-07-31 16:55:46 I'm holding, but only those stocks that follow my plan. UTX, CPRT
835 2018-07-31 16:55:14 I believe our fish stocks help the fur trade over there as the offal etc left over from the fishing trade is fed to the other animals.
836 2018-07-31 16:55:09 He really thinks this will help the value of his stocks.
837 2018-07-31 16:54:55 that’s a bad question bc i hate that character even without it lmao, and it’s a whole different game which only has two stocks, and even then i think it should be rosa banned or nothing
838 2018-07-31 16:54:38 The float has turned over 25 times this morning. $HMNY could easily go over $20 this afternoon!!

842 2018-07-31 16:53:06 Sold off 75% of my tech stocks today considering most were priced well above earnings. Best of luck to those staying in but sometimes it’s better to quit while you’re ahead 
843 2018-07-31 16:52:45 I think the biggest short squeeze in the history of the stock market is coming soon!

PRICE ACTION FOR $HMNY THID MORNING IS PROOF THAT BEARS ARE IM TROUBLE, BUT THE STILL WANT TO CONTINUE TO TRY AND BASH THEIR WAY OUT OF IT.

847 2018-07-31 16:50:58 Our apologies for this, Kelly. The challenge was to run 'whilst stocks last', and due to lots of people taking part, this was a few days before the end of the month. Do be sure to keep an eye out for future such events! Team Tempur.

851 2018-07-31 16:50:08 @realDonaldTrump  What does Facebook know about identifying a new political influence campaign that has been operating on its platform with the intention of influencing the US midterm elections scheduled for November? With their stocks falling is this a tactic to influence stock?
852 2018-07-31 16:49:45 Tech stocks ran too far prior to their earnings. $QQQ $XLK
853 2018-07-31 16:48:50 They are trying to distract away from the censorship issue that tanked their stocks... Don't buy it.
854 2018-07-31 16:48:42 The good thing is they have about 3.5 months of life and lots more can happen.  But the s232 answer was delayed. The TiO2 decision has been delayed to '19.  The Short Pos is getting nuts @ 20M. UEC says little of their Vanadium & options.  So, all are drags on the stocks/options.
855 2018-07-31 16:48:10 I'd be dumping Harris and Cuomo at those prices as well--not sure what is driving those stocks. . . .irrational exuberance?

859 2018-07-31 16:47:33 With Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan both warning on the stock market, is today's epic bond buying an attempt to prop up stocks or a "safety" play because stocks are about to plunge?
860 2018-07-31 16:47:16 Taking this with a grain of salt. It has nothing to do with tanking of their stocks that they are "discovering" this now, right? Also: could make people fall for "now it is all good" in social media land.
861 2018-07-31 16:46:56 $AAPL will beat earnings and its gonna shoot up and will revive all the tech stocks.
862 2018-07-31 16:46:44 Large capacity magazines, bump stocks, and trigger cranks are more realistically candidates for 3D printing. But, guns themselves are not foreseeably any real threat in the near future.

868 2018-07-31 16:45:13 Today is the eom rebalance and they are buying bonds to balance their portfolios. The balance % depends on whether stocks have outperformed bonds during the month. Stocks normally sell off today into the close.
869 2018-07-31 16:44:56 remember when i told you stocks topped in january and the rally would fail right here...

874 2018-07-31 16:41:30 Honestly I am sick and tired of hearing about middle class. They have leeway. What about the poor? Those who can't pay bills or eat consistently? No pension,no savings, no stocks, one disaster from homelessness?  Homelessness and poverty are continually criminalized.

883 2018-07-31 16:38:26 I agree with your sentiment: all criminals must be hunted and prosecuted. However, VBS took money from the poor and public money, i.e. my and your money, so let's focus on them. Those who invested in Steinhoff stocks can wait until the municipalities' money is reimbursed.

895 2018-07-31 16:33:34 With the all-important AAPL report in a matter of hours, interesting to see how little fear there is in the market with stocks up sharply today and the VIX fear gauge back down to 13 - especially considering the pummeling the other FAANG stocks have received (good reports & bad)
896 2018-07-31 16:33:18 Take a “chill” pill. Your stocks aren’t in danger of being stolen by the hoi-poloi. Your saying that the blue collar/ service sector worker is better off is disingenuous, if not predictable.

909 2018-07-31 16:27:44 I did a lot of chart reading this past few weeks. A lot of stocks hit 1-3 year lows. That's the part I'm referring to. The rest of the volatility is fun IMO. Just have to be patient and set good limits/stops.
910 2018-07-31 16:27:33 I've considered starting to short some stocks to see if I can profit off this next market crash. (which is fucked up that we can do, but it's coming sooner rather than later. Republicans control all three parts of the government right now.)
911 2018-07-31 16:27:18 Once November comes id start buying Nigerian stocks  Caverton I see you
912 2018-07-31 16:26:55 Better sell your Twitter stocks, soon to be worthless, my moneys on Kim
913 2018-07-31 16:25:32 Yes, as a public service, I will start tweeting the trades I make. Everyone can then do the opposite.

It seems as though I have the Sidam Touch when it comes to stocks .
914 2018-07-31 16:25:04 *NYSE STOCKS*
For anyone looking to dabble with the New York Stock Exchange & not just drop $700 into Apple or Microsoft, look out for:
$ARNC ($21.63)  3.74%
$TEVA ($24.05)  1.26%
And keep an eye on Tesla
$TSLA ($295.81)  1.93%, it’s sub-$300 & only goin up     
915 2018-07-31 16:23:31 If you find one to join we will follow!  There would be such an exodus that Twitter's stock would fall into penny stocks 
916 2018-07-31 16:23:27 Slippages in Positional system don't matter much. For intraday system, I assume 0.05% as slippage for stocks & 0.025% for Index
917 2018-07-31 16:22:14 if Xi folds on trade. Chinese Meme stocks upgraded to Convicted Buys.
918 2018-07-31 16:22:12 Bwahahahaha! The only reason that Muslim Marxist didn't have negative GDP was quantitative easing where the Fed poured money into the stocks market for interest free for years remember that?
919 2018-07-31 16:21:53 But assault weapons? Bump stocks? Armor-piercing bullets? Suppressors? High capacity magazines? Background checks? Waiting periods? Of course not!
920 2018-07-31 16:21:29 Mr. Wonderful, who "called the top" in $FB at $120 now thinks its a "must own" at $175 after a 20% drop & future margin erosion.

"I don't buy stocks that don't pay dividends."
921 2018-07-31 16:21:08 Does sky have stocks in it?
922 2018-07-31 16:20:51 Il a fait sa journée... Je pense que si je faisais tombé l'étage avec les ordis et les écrans à mon taf je sauterais par la fenêtre de la salle des stocks... Soit y en avoir pour environ 10.000€ sur cette étagère probablement plus en fait
923 2018-07-31 16:20:50 $AAPL is set to report earnings after the bell Tuesday as the tech sector witnesses an incredible sell-off (re: $FB $AMZN $NFLX ). Can $AAPL earnings stop the bleeding of the tech stocks?
924 2018-07-31 16:20:45 NRA doesn't always think through the negatives. Case in point: they supported a ban on "rate increasing devices." It was intended to ban bump-fire stocks, but could be expanded to triggers, muzzle devices, lightweight parts, etc.
925 2018-07-31 16:20:30 I dont understand man..  im just trading the stock, and dont really care about the SEC and what they or the HFT's, or what the stocks actually do.  I have and Entry, Exit, and Stop in place... so what else is there to worry about?
926 2018-07-31 16:20:27 So much talk about some bellwether stocks coming under pressure last few days. Don't read much into it. It's quite obvious that a shift a happening. Smart money moving out of safe haven and into riskier names.
927 2018-07-31 16:20:25 Don't forget USMC stocks
928 2018-07-31 16:20:17 When you try and do your bit for society and donate your blood as O- stocks are dangerously low, as the adverts, phone calls and notifications remind me every day... and then you turn up and get turned away!? Where is the sense in that @NHSEngland
929 2018-07-31 16:20:16 Actually it's just a capital gains tax cut, which is double taxation anyway. 
Smart responsible people invest in stocks for retirement, not envy.
930 2018-07-31 16:20:11 “I am looking into it” just means I will do nothing. Seen it before. Remember bump stocks?
931 2018-07-31 16:19:29 Not Stocks Going Up 
932 2018-07-31 16:18:45 I’m heated, stocks I sold in April rose 210% SMHHHHHH
933 2018-07-31 16:18:27 Not if the @nra can't make money out of it, you mean?

Or should people 3D print bump stocks too?
934 2018-07-31 16:16:58 When downloadable 3-d blueprints are outlawed, only outlaws with 3-d printers with suitable consumable media will have homemade guns.  Like a ban on bump-stocks, this could turn YouTubers into a wave of new NRA members. 
935 2018-07-31 16:16:53 Stocks having a nice bounce back after yesterday’s wreckage
936 2018-07-31 16:16:22 What workers? Wages have remained stagnant since the tax cut for the rich. Instead they used that tax money to buy back stocks. Enriching themselves even more. Where’s our money?
937 2018-07-31 16:16:19 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to improve your chronic fatigue
938 2018-07-31 16:16:12 I know miners, oilers etc. Mine always end with a bang and a scratch trade at best. Don't trade hardly any these days. I like very boring stocks. Volatility inversely related to profits imv.
939 2018-07-31 16:16:00 The top five stocks lower at noon today are $IPGP, $CMG, $RE, $STX, and $HP.
940 2018-07-31 16:15:39 Stock buybacks just artificially increase the earnings per share of a company which boost their stocks price in the short term. That’s important because ceo’s are compensated based on how well their stock is doing...
941 2018-07-31 16:15:12 AppleMac stocks plummet
942 2018-07-31 16:14:51  If I’ve said it once I’ve said it a million times..

945 2018-07-31 16:14:48 No EU exports to date are down 24% YoY. The EU commission projects them UP 18% YoY. (thats a 9.4mmt swing if current pace stays the same)

Feed usage is left unchanged ignoring a 5 year high in Wheat premiums over Corn in France.

15/16->16/17 saw EU stocks decline.
946 2018-07-31 16:14:46 the high frequency trading adds tons of liquidity to the market.  much more than average retail traders like us.  but in stocks with low liquidity like IFMK, the market makers, banks, and HFT's can tank it in a flash
947 2018-07-31 16:14:25 The same people who "misunderstood" bump stocks....
948 2018-07-31 16:13:55 The top five most active stocks ate noon today are $AMD, $TWTR, $BAC, $GE, and $FB.
949 2018-07-31 16:13:17 Nice pop in $XYL today. #117 overall. Best Stocks Now App. NO current position.
950 2018-07-31 16:12:32 I'm dumping all my trench coat stocks. They can simply make the guns right there in school now, great. For the first time ever I'm actually hoping the NRA does that thing they do to stop this.
951 2018-07-31 16:12:31 Stephanie - you have the greatest toned arms on CNBC.    And you have wonderful insight on stocks!!! @Stephanie_Link

957 2018-07-31 16:09:17 Joe, our economy and stocks are run by the wealthy and corporations, Obama’s economy was steady and slowly changing to the future? Trumps friends are the coal the steel fuel, they hurt our families from cancer to sickness, they don’t care about us money is their mighty sad for us
958 2018-07-31 16:08:55 If they are legal let's make them illegal. This is like bump stocks.
959 2018-07-31 16:08:50 This woman will help decide civil discourse at @Twitter ?? Oh my, sell those stocks of you have them. Epic fail @Jack

961 2018-07-31 16:08:19 Question. So what do you do from here?  Wait for the close and put in a limit order to buy above Monday’s high?  These stocks tend to ramp or dump fast on earnings and I suspect it will come down to the report.

So be patient with your husband and your stocks ....you never know when they will rock.
966 2018-07-31 16:06:46 It is only in the US that less exports mean you are building stocks. Elsewhere, you export less because you have less availabilities ;)
967 2018-07-31 16:06:33 Yeah. Im no liberal. Im a vet and I own guns, and I am more than willing to say its a bad idea, along with bump stocks. I also think we need better background checks and I hate the NRA. They make responsible gun owners look like shit.
968 2018-07-31 16:06:29 Friday-Monday 3% loss nearly unprecedented as majority of significant nasdaq stocks lost much higher percentage than that. Summer volatility blamed, what a crock.
969 2018-07-31 16:04:48 How did Trump go from "I'm going to look into banning bump stocks" to "Are you feeling suicidal, fancy shooting some folk but cant get registered for a gun? No problem. Get your downloadable instructions on "How to make a 3D gun" after midnight tonight!"?????
DaFuck?

975 2018-07-31 16:01:47 The popular fintwit stocks are usually the old leaders. I put my faith in emerging leaders that sneak out of a base under the fintwit radar. If you see a huge trend then you already missed a huge trend 
976 2018-07-31 16:01:25 ok thanks.  when some stocks go red/green on a bad day like yesterday then usually they're ready for a pop when indexes show strength   MGEN yesterday, that's why i got in yesterday.
977 2018-07-31 16:01:12 yessir!

They should have been charged with a 'disorderly' criminal attack on an elderly lady. Police 'social workers' now

987 2018-07-31 15:56:40 I don't think so.. There are stocks more than 2 months now
988 2018-07-31 15:56:32 hell no, i stay away from heavily manipulated #stocks like that man
989 2018-07-31 15:56:13 Was expecting rotation out of #energy stocks...not happening for now but #crude's pattern is damaged in da very short-term...
990 2018-07-31 15:56:03 Sure a lot of spikey mining plays out there on TSXV and CSE.  Take care speculating especially when the forums are infested with spams of 0.01-0.05 speculative stocks that will be unloaded to you if you get lured into buying spammers' shares.
991 2018-07-31 15:55:47 Well, Frank I have to leave in a little bit, so have to go, will talk to you later tonight if you're around! Hope the stocks keep going UP!!
992 2018-07-31 15:55:08 Sorry Ravi but a bad performance qtr after qtr is a little unnerving.  And by that reason then we sud be bullish on all stocks. Including the likes of PC jwellers.  No doubt Tamo is a good company but they are going wrong somewhere and it may take a while for them to excel

1000 2018-07-31 15:53:08 $awx range is between 2 an 3 dollars...you invest in stocks with earnings or potential earnings not because they are being manipulated
1001 2018-07-31 15:52:56 Time to buy tech stocks while they're down
1002 2018-07-31 15:52:20 Given what's occurring on q2 earnings reports and many leadership stocks falling art, along with commentary of caution by many big WS names, looking at ytd data and trying to connect dots, it would appear the former not the later
1003 2018-07-31 15:52:14 Stocks on radar for a long side play for tomorrow - IndusInd, BHEL, ONGC, PowerGrid, ZEEL, AmaraRaja, CEAT, Siemens, RBL, Arvind.
1004 2018-07-31 15:51:45 If all these pensions can't be solvent with markets parabolic near all time highs, what happens when stocks pull back 30%+? Exactly the same response as japan. They'll devalue the dollar at least by a third
1005 2018-07-31 15:50:53 No, there isn’t. It’s what @ASLEFthsc have been asking for ages. If it happens in the rear/inactive cab, you get an alarm on most stocks and that’s it. No warning for if it’s about to happen to your active driving cab.
1006 2018-07-31 15:50:13 Kinda like you were gonna ban bump stocks?
1007 2018-07-31 15:50:12 Tenso é quando você investe em empresa boa, com bons números mas, só desvaloriza... tem que ter braço pra tocar em frente sem vender no fundo viu. #ações #mercado #stocks
1008 2018-07-31 15:49:20 ...now, consider we have never seen 20.7 Mt ending stocks here in Europe...

1011 2018-07-31 15:47:46 I'm a machinist.  I can cut anything from metal.  There are strict laws in place keeping me from making my own rounds and stocks and guns.  Imagine if I made rounds out of magnesium or white sulfur.  She's full of shit.  Using any argument she can to defend printing guns.
1012 2018-07-31 15:47:25 My stocks are looking nice 
1013 2018-07-31 15:47:23 His only concern is that he won't make money off his stocks in "real guns." The NRA agrees with him.
1014 2018-07-31 15:46:54 Guys, i have a lot of stocks of different antidepressants, mood stabilizers and antipsychotics that I can't drink anymore because I have completely different prescriptions now. The expiry dates are a year or two from now and idk what to do with them 
1015 2018-07-31 15:46:43 Anything from J.P. morgan/chase can not be trusted. They only have their own interests in mind. Truth is, they know any crash or downturn will allow them to buy up stocks etc at a discount. This is their motivation and their game. The economy has always grown overall.
1016 2018-07-31 15:45:52 Bump stocks are still available for purchase. So call me skeptical that Donald’s actually going to do a damn thing he promises about gun reform.
1017 2018-07-31 15:45:48 @GregMannarino I positioned to make some $ off of the Dead Cat Bounce in Tech stocks over the next week or so.  : ]

1018 2018-07-31 15:45:26 I'd rather count myself among those calmly taking profits in a rally and selling to those who are aggressively and anxiously bidding up for stocks that just rose
1019 2018-07-31 15:45:19 you realize he can't unilaterally do any of those things, even banning bump stocks, same with the 3-D printer situation, it's all on congress.. and raising minimum age to purchase a gun to 21 is ridiculous, unless we're gonna do the same for vehicle licenses and voting also..
1020 2018-07-31 15:44:57 What a day for $ILMN!! Range from $304 to $321 #Trading #Stocks #StocksToTrade #StocksToWatch better than chasing $HMNY imo
1021 2018-07-31 15:44:40 Telling people that use credit to buy groceries because they spent their last dollar on rent to buy stocks is dumb. It’s very “let them eat cake.”
1022 2018-07-31 15:43:18 Well, getting ready to head to Sacramento this morning have to leave soon. The fires aren't too close but by all the smoke you'd think they were. Glad the stocks are doing good!
1023 2018-07-31 15:42:23 He realized that bump stocks are fairly normal.
1024 2018-07-31 15:40:48 Duh. Neither do bump stocks but you haven’t done sht about them either.  You and the gop owned by the nra
1025 2018-07-31 15:40:00 Really?  Didn’t get slapped around enough by the NRA on Bump stocks. #PutinsPuppet #nrawhippingboy
1026 2018-07-31 15:40:00 I'm a little doubtful about Twitter since their shadow bans are becoming more noticeable and they just got their gov't funds pulled also like Facebook.. Beware of the dump on those 2 stocks coming up..

1029 2018-07-31 15:39:40 Yea, right after you ban bump stocks. Who do you think believes your lies anymore?

1033 2018-07-31 15:38:07 @DominicRaab If government is not going to stockpile food, who is? Supermarkets can't as even the larger ones only have capacity to store up to 5 days worth of food. Also there could be astronomical price increases as stocks dwindled & demand increased. #StopBrexitSaveBritain
1034 2018-07-31 15:37:48 You do a great job Dan, indeed there will be an 'expected' bounce in the support region. Unfortunately like stocks and shares, this bounce will not indicate a healthy higher low. In a manipulated market, it just means the whales are playing with the traders for higher profits
1035 2018-07-31 15:37:10 ... because of this the stock market will tank hard at some point ... my guess is between now and 2020.  For how long and how bad it's down is anyone's guess.  I believe some of those stocks will NOT come back that are not on the #AmericaFirst agenda ... so some tech, energy, etc
1036 2018-07-31 15:36:54 @djvlad Vlad stocks is a good watch. I'm learning a lot.

"This idea that he’ll look into it, we’ve been down that rabbit hole before, remember bump stocks? The NRA said sure let’s look into it, we’ve had no action. On issue after issue the Trump administration’s MO when there’s a crisis is to say we’ll look into it."
1038 2018-07-31 15:36:06 Let's not forget his tax scam. Trump & the top 1% made out HUGE & most only invested in their stocks- Just like the last TWO failed trickle down economics scams! The rich get richer. Only 2% got crumbs & who do think is gonna pay for the billions lost to the govt from these cuts?
1039 2018-07-31 15:35:40 But PEL is safer, coz it’s well diversified. Most of the other dividend stocks are PSU’s and some tech stocks. Like Infy, hcl, TCS...coal india has a yield of over 6% last I checked.

1042 2018-07-31 15:34:40 So Twitter and Facebook stocks are rebounding. I knew they would. We are too addicted to social media for them not to rebound. 
1043 2018-07-31 15:34:27 Would you invest in stocks
1044 2018-07-31 15:34:17 You are not going to find big winning stocks if you focus on stocks that are already household names.  The next big winners are the names you DON'T know well; smaller in size and unknown to the average investor.

1047 2018-07-31 15:33:24 In your opinion, do share repurchases slow the velocity of money supply in the overall economy?   My suspicion is that they do, because most people don’t think of their stocks as immediately available cash, nor do Baka lend this money out. Dividends, by contrast... 1/

1086 2018-07-31 15:19:35 So after that $1 trillion tax cut that allowed the 1%, they may be getting another $100 billion Capital Gains Tax. Oh! I get it! The rich guys bought stocks with the 1st cut. Now they get a tax break when they sell those stocks just bought. I get it.

1093 2018-07-31 15:17:16 If it was commonly known that an expert can reliably forecast crashes, then when the expert does predict a crash, people would panic sell their assets/stocks, bringing prices down and then there'd be more selling, and so on.

1132 2018-07-31 15:05:18 Peter - This valuable insight will be one of my regular reminders. I quickly learned (of course, after losing money) that the best way to learn trading is to use low volatility stocks.

1161 2018-07-31 14:56:23 Oh man my weed stocks are coming down faster than a teenager smoking oregano.
1162 2018-07-31 14:56:07 Gotta be stocks. Investing that long with no return.
1163 2018-07-31 14:56:05 It is the best thing for my bank account too, +3000$ in 2017 for my US stocks growth(8000$ instead of 5 years of 5000$)! As Canadian it is all that matter! 
1164 2018-07-31 14:55:53 $aapl earnings might make or break tech stocks
1165 2018-07-31 14:54:24 Just had a client tell me “sometimes I want to change my career and just trade for a living...just research stocks all day and get paid for it” - YIKES
1166 2018-07-31 14:53:21 it's happening & it's real because people would rather talk about the bank of japan announcing that they're doing nothing than talk about everyone turning around & shorting tech stocks yesterady
1167 2018-07-31 14:53:21 $spy $spx $vix this market is akin to someone who’s fallen in the water and can’t swim. 2 of the 4 stocks holding this Mkt up (other than the Govt) just crashed. Lot of heavy lifting, can’t hold, will be fugly whn it breaks

1175 2018-07-31 14:49:26 Learn how to utilize the internet to make money. Whether learning markets from stocks to cryptos to your own personal business or having a following and learning to use that influence. The internet in itself is a gold mine if you learn how to use. Now y’all have a good day
1176 2018-07-31 14:48:04 It’s fantastic that our national parks are being sold out 4 mining, in reality. The stock market was +108% under Obama coming from a recession, Im sure you were super excited about all “your stocks” back then too. The same people that think NK will denuke believe ISIS is gone. 
1177 2018-07-31 14:47:15 Market is just super weird this week. We are tech heavy indexes and they are totally funky. I am still in the $UVXY puts and holding steady still. They popped this morning. you had a momentary 38% win at open $VIX

1180 2018-07-31 14:47:08 Waiting? Things are different here in Malaysia. Stocks are abundant but some people refuse to send their car for inflator replacement. Citing, lack of free time etc. The replacement took me 10 mins in total.
1181 2018-07-31 14:46:55 I don't think they'll get it until these publicly traded social media platforms become penny stocks.
1182 2018-07-31 14:46:32 Of course, but the people who make a killing in stocks are unaffected by this. I see more value in a proportional model of tax allocation, rather than a flat % for everyone. Bill Gates should pay more than 200K/year in taxes, would you agree?
1183 2018-07-31 14:45:40 It’s never too late to start that business, buy the car or invest in stocks/bonds/shares etc.
1184 2018-07-31 14:45:35 Bump Stocks  drop!!!
1185 2018-07-31 14:43:59 You can't compare the two, way more magic players watching cards then stocks, usually when their is a sustained spike, it's because of demand, people rushing in to get it before the spike they know is coming
1186 2018-07-31 14:43:55 Hi, Dawn, I boycott Amazon because it was one of the stocks Soros had invested in. From my research he’s off to buying up Fox stocks. I deem that man as being very evil & I would not spend my money on any of his companies. Anyone against my Country doesn’t get my support.
1187 2018-07-31 14:43:46 Liquid good quality stocks with good liquidity, fairly stable prices, good Management and decent Volitility

1196 2018-07-31 14:40:28 We don't need to make an adjustment based on the higher stock price since it's a % calculation. Many people are afraid to buy expensive stocks. They think they can't afford it because buying 2 shares doesn't seem sexy, or they think it can't possibly go up more. Neither is true.

1204 2018-07-31 14:38:32 Kind of why I missed having more than 2 stocks.
1205 2018-07-31 14:37:51 The pic is real. The economy is holding . It’s best if I were trading stocks but the stock market isn’t indicative of the general economy. I’ve been a nurse 22 years and have a spouse and 2 kids. Trump is a moron.

But that’s all MHO!

1234 2018-07-31 14:29:16 Go buy stocks today while they’re still cheap
1235 2018-07-31 14:28:18 Yeah definitely. Although in my local Tesco there is a very small part that stocks very little Veggie stuff which is a bit disappointing.
1236 2018-07-31 14:28:04 These EVIL HUMAN HAUNTERS  have one easy disguise in their hide out group, is their laughing stocks. Locals love the loafers more than others. Therefore Haunters get advantage in this region. Other advantage is the politics.
1237 2018-07-31 14:27:43 Not just a bunch of rich dudes. It was also one of the most popular stocks on RobinHood, an investing platform popular with millenials. A lot of them lost thousands, which is a lot of money to the average millennial.

1239 2018-07-31 14:26:36 More to point if you're on unemployment/social benefits, pennies-$100 can buy some stocks, once you buy+read books/do a nice course to better & good sense. Will the average person wake up to save+invest+diversify & treat such well? I don't know. Lives might change if they did
1240 2018-07-31 14:25:44 He did the same thing on bump stocks. Now there's a new law. He shouldn't be talking about it at all.
1241 2018-07-31 14:25:42 Remember Trump's tough talk about banning bump stocks, restricting assault rifles to those over 21,and how he said he was not beholden to the NRA. Lies, lies, and more lies
1242 2018-07-31 14:25:28 Or just unknowingly ignorant.  Stocks for many are mythical aspirations that can lift people out of poverty.
1243 2018-07-31 14:25:04 Like you looked into banning bump stocks?
1244 2018-07-31 14:24:53 In before the NRA cucks on this just like bump stocks.
1245 2018-07-31 14:24:53 Money market rates are creeping up, people can get above 2% now with a high enough minimum.  Haven't seen that in a LONG time.  Stocks are about to have some more competition from the fixed income markets.  #watchtheyieldcurve

1305 2018-07-31 14:09:30 $4,000 raise implies each year. Would this article get written about a dividend increase in the same way?

Are buybacks : dividends not just bonus : salary for investors? Easier to give a one-time thing than increase a dividend, since investors punish stocks for decreasing later.
1306 2018-07-31 14:09:26 Like you? But this is the same for most pot stocks .. smart people took profits December/January and didn't buy the top  .. revenues are impressive though, can't deny that.

1310 2018-07-31 14:08:21 I am not pro by all means. I think for smaller accounts, it is better to buy quality stocks and hold a little longer for  larger profits than constantly trading. I.e  for $amd was around $12 in March which would return over 60% in 4 months. Jst a thought

1329 2018-07-31 14:03:57 Mr. President, I am a huge supporter, but criminalizing this is a bad idea. The NRA is not the arbiter of civil rights for decent people. They are right sometimes and wrong sometimes. I adamantly disagree with banning home-made polymer guns and bump stocks. Please hear us!

1414 2018-07-31 13:37:11 Why do you need to speak to NRA before taking action?  Are you afraid of the NRA?  Is NRA also beholding to Russia?  And where is the action you promised on banning bump stocks and other common sense measures?  You've done zero to prevent gun violence.
1415 2018-07-31 13:36:50 Doesn’t change the fact that the tax cuts still only really help the people who own stocks. How many average workers own stocks? & of those people who own stocks, how many of the working poor will benefit in any way? You suck
1416 2018-07-31 13:36:32 Stocks rise after report that US and China are said to restart talks to avoid trade war

1432 2018-07-31 13:31:03 I got an idea! Before talking about things u clearly cannot comprehend. Why don’t u compare both stocks to the sector. Tell me what u find! Go! Any moron can do what u just did!
1433 2018-07-31 13:31:02 Breaking (9:30 AM EDT): Stocks rise after report that US and China are said to restart talks to avoid trade war -- CNBC
1434 2018-07-31 13:30:40 Sir,So you mean to say, keep booking profits on stocks and sit on cash.? Or switch to stocks which have not rallied unlike the top 10
1435 2018-07-31 13:30:34 The NRA is behind this.They want to be able to release the schematics on more types of firearms so that their customers can continue to modify their products even after bans on bump stocks, ect. They make money off parts. Plastic guns won't hurt business, 4 terrorists & hobbyists
1436 2018-07-31 13:30:17 $SHW $GOOGL $ADBE $BA $ISRG Calls will be closed at high of the day. These stocks generally gap up and run positive  and pull back
1437 2018-07-31 13:30:14 Thank you for exposing the BS of #Liberals & frankly anyone who claims they support the #2a when they clearly don’t.

Spoiler alert 
If your for banning anything (including bump stocks) your not for the #2a

Every law passed is a chip against it

1439 2018-07-31 13:29:27 after that big move yesterday I'm not taking any positions today. I also want to see how $tsla and $aapl do with earnings, as that could either reverse the market or continue to let it slide. #market #OptionsTrading #stocks #investing #money
1440 2018-07-31 13:29:10 Just like you were going to make bump stocks illegal, raise the minimum age to purchase assault weapons and not be afraid to stand up to the NRA, until you were afraid to stand up to the NRA. Your hollow tweets mean nothing to the American people.

1445 2018-07-31 13:27:56 Up or down I've learned that $stocks and a sucker play. They always go down even when they look like they are up, and you don't own or control anything. Buy #bitcoin now before it's to late.

1451 2018-07-31 13:25:38 Scott, I think there is a chance that URA sees what has been going on with all the sector IPOs, fuel price strength, and buzz and may come to the point of freezing positions.  After all these guys have to know w U price spike stocks go up multiples of themselves. We shall see.
1452 2018-07-31 13:23:57 Just went through this video...looks great!!! Thks much!!!

You are such a fraud.

1456 2018-07-31 13:22:50 It's hard work shorting cult stocks, and many short gurus say just don't bother.
1457 2018-07-31 13:21:15 Others are rocking, but nope UEC. I think hasn´t a trend clear, so, better U penny stocks without a clear trend.
1458 2018-07-31 13:21:03 Do I think bump stocks should be legal? No. But congress passed it due to what the law is. One bullet per trigger pull.

1478 2018-07-31 13:12:07 FMCG, Tech, Metal, Pharma and Auto stocks gained while PSU Banks and NBFC stocks faced profit booking.
1479 2018-07-31 13:11:37 Auto stocks like Maruti, Bajaj Auto and Hero Motocorp gained 1-2% on ahead of tomorrow monthly sales volumes.
1480 2018-07-31 13:11:32 From my read of charts, most stocks are saying no and others are saying possibly.
1481 2018-07-31 13:11:29 PSU Banking stocks pared from the intra-day high on account of profit booking. SBI declined 1% to close at Rs294 while it touched the day's high of Rs302. Bank of India slipped 9% to close at Rs94 after it announced poor Q1 result. However, BOB gained 1% to close at Rs153

1493 2018-07-31 13:08:57 Yeah, just like you looked into banning bump stocks.  You were probably talking to the NRA about getting some more millions of $ funneled through them from your Russian friends.
1494 2018-07-31 13:08:54 If there is no deal then the stocks will dwindle and not be replaces as quickly. Hence why the government are stockpiling said foods and medicines. That’s fact and not project fear too
1495 2018-07-31 13:08:47 Actually it is reported that wages have flattened out however CEO's have had quite a boost in their salaries. Also, large companies are not using tax cuts to reward employees, they are buying back their stocks.
Start telling the truth
1496 2018-07-31 13:08:31 Just like you were gonna look into raising the age to 21or banning bump stocks. @nra lapdog.

1509 2018-07-31 13:04:21 I agree. Circuit breaker shouldn't affect stocks going up. I understand if it triggers when going down to stave off a stock market collapse, but going up? That's absurd.

1525 2018-07-31 12:57:06 It's toast. Literally 99% of Q stocks end up like this yet folks pump these as "life changers" and "going to $1.00". Amazing...
1526 2018-07-31 12:57:02 Ok cool. Bad few weeks for lithium stocks but hopefully instos will start to buy long term once they see value
1527 2018-07-31 12:57:02 My 403b market return has only been 1% in 2018, so the gains haven't even been all that spectacular. Growth is repeatedly erased, regrows, erased, regrows. It appears I'm heavily invested in tech stocks but still.
1528 2018-07-31 12:56:53 CVN was the last one and after seeing it add $400m to its market cap on a 20% interest in a well smaller than PCLs makes me happy to take a punt here

As i said from the start it will either be a Hero or a Zero

1534 2018-07-31 12:55:24 What about bump stocks? You promised a ban on them! You will fold on this one, too.
1535 2018-07-31 12:54:47 It doesn't make sense, but you won't do anything about it just like you haven't banned bump stocks or raised the age for buying certain rifles.  You're a liar.

1541 2018-07-31 12:52:03 Since you are such buddies with the killing machine aka the NRA speak to them about taking assault weapons & bump stocks out of the hands of civilians, upping the legal age to purchase guns and better back ground checks?  Or are you waiting for the next mass murder of children?
1542 2018-07-31 12:51:20 Hi dear~ yes, we’ll still hopefully have a next batch for army bomb v3 as long as stocks will still be avail 
1543 2018-07-31 12:50:57 In a vacation till weekend just checked the market. Actually the bank nifty did not open up green and did not have an uptrend today. So the banking stocks failed to trend higher today and they started to downtrend with their indices.  Also ICICI bank and BOB did not open higher
1544 2018-07-31 12:50:39 When all that tax cut money in buying back stocks that's propping up the markets is gone, the recession is NOT far from the road.  Watch out for the markets to crash.
1545 2018-07-31 12:49:56 Not if it is a raise. Stocks last year to year too. Right now they just go to a small number of people.
1546 2018-07-31 12:49:53 Lemme help you out, champ, in terms that might break through:

Guy buys stocks on the Chicago Exchange for 32 and sells them on the New York Exchange for 34.  He does this for ten years, then buys a nice house in the Hamptons.
1547 2018-07-31 12:49:09 That was an ordeal. H&M Leeds trinity is not equipped to sell the clothes it stocks. Over 45 mins queuing for trying on then the til. Needs twice as many tips & changing rooms. @hm good job I have flexi time.
1548 2018-07-31 12:48:59 Public companies, traded on a public stock exchange, are called Public Companies and are, by LAW, must disclose EVERY SINGLE NUANCE of how the company runs, the leaders, the strategies, the market, their goals, payroll, stocks etc. and any material significance must be REPORTED.
1549 2018-07-31 12:48:44 You promised to ban bump stocks and then caved to the NRA. WAS that because they funneled Russian money to your campaign?
1550 2018-07-31 12:47:03 Well now.  Remember who you are talking to here.  We still have no ban on bump stocks and no age limits have been revised. 
1551 2018-07-31 12:46:58 Multiple PMS fund management firms are calling claiming to give me better returns than mutual funds or individual stocks.

1552 2018-07-31 12:46:50 The Russell 1000 Value $IWD has a trailing PE ratio of 20.5x. What is more believable? That there are 1000 *truly* undervalued stocks on the market or that such stocks are undervalued at 20.5x?
1553 2018-07-31 12:45:58 Not every one who buys and sells stocks and pays capital gain are RICH.  Do u at @thehill have a 401k or IRA?

1554 2018-07-31 12:45:26 I can just hear McDonald's and CVS employees now: "Hmmm... I have a family, a huge stack of bills, rent, a car payment, an empty fridge. What on earth should I spend my paycheck on? Oh, I know... stocks!"
1555 2018-07-31 12:45:06 OptionHacker alerted traders to bullish unusual option activity in 9 stocks Monday including $P, $OCN and  $BAC.   Top performer was a same-day gain of 50% in $OCN where October 4.0 calls bought for $0.25 closed at $0.38.
1556 2018-07-31 12:44:38 Uh huh.  You said that about Bump stocks too, and did nothing.  You're in the NRA's pocket as much as you're in Putin's.
1557 2018-07-31 12:44:28 @jimcramer  When does a long time home gamer who is comfortable in owning and trading individual stocks, start looking at trading options?
1558 2018-07-31 12:44:15 I didn't have the time to trade and sell my stocks. Long be hold I was watching shark tank and a group of guys walk up to the investor and present this idea to them and they invest into this company that is low key on the rise don't be late bloomer .
1559 2018-07-31 12:43:50 2-3 I’m just saying. Here is how it works. 

Acorns takes your spare change and whatever you want to invest on a monthly basis. And distribute it into fortune 500 companies. I started with $5 dollars. I started investing in stocks about a month and was losing money because

1570 2018-07-31 12:39:29 I don't short stocks as long term investments. But there might be a quick trade as a result of earnings. In $AAPL's case, the case you make on their buybacks adds to other reasons I wouldn't make it an investment short. I rarely do, not even in $TSLA
1571 2018-07-31 12:39:00 Stocks?
1572 2018-07-31 12:38:59 NRA's not going to like Mr Joe Random printing guns in his shed.  They won't make any money off it.  They'd be more inclined to ban 3-D printed guns than silencers and bump-stocks.

1574 2018-07-31 12:38:46 They’re not really a big seller. Drops are used by gangs and assassins. I’m wondering why you don’t know the difference between “for sale” and “available” to the public. You’re impotent anyway. Bump stocks are still legal.
1575 2018-07-31 12:38:19 I can’t stop buying stocks now, I really want more sneakers :(

1577 2018-07-31 12:37:54 you’ll fold just like a card table just like you did with bump stocks once you see how much  the NRA will donate to your party - because you NEED the NRA.
1578 2018-07-31 12:37:50 Stop censoring Conservatives. We have the right to speak our minds. You stock is dropping. Did you honestly think only Liberals buy stocks? Lol. It will continue to drop.

1585 2018-07-31 12:34:08 For every action, there is a reaction in this closed system of ours. Solving one problem may create another: what will it do to crab stocks and forests? (Already under stress in some parts of the world.) Reducing waste and changing attitudes is essential as a start.

1587 2018-07-31 12:33:19 Umm, no he didn’t. He did however approve bump stocks. Think about that.
1588 2018-07-31 12:32:58 Why does NRA have any say in this? #NRABloodMoney you still have not done anything about bump stocks nor anything about gun control in general.  Vegas and Parkland happened on your watch and still you do NOTHING!
1589 2018-07-31 12:32:29 Well another reason to cancel Netflix subscription now.  Guess who is getting a channel on there?  Louis Faarrakhan!!!I  I guess they want more people to cancel their service, stocks to plummet until they go out of business. These people just don't get it.

1593 2018-07-31 12:28:47 @MichaelAvenatti I find it such a shame that perfect decent men who had stellar law  careers who millions looked up to and used to want to ape are now turning and have turned in laughing stocks and ridicule and for what - a man who is so vile on every front of life!

1600 2018-07-31 12:25:43 Stocks go up and down based on emotion. If you can be rational amidst the emotion, you may profit. #Stocks #TuesdayThoughts
1601 2018-07-31 12:25:39 I left a message for the NRA, but Col. North never called me back! Ban assault rifles and bump stocks! Close the gun show loophole! And shut your LYING piehole while you are at it! #LSSC #Basta #TheList #FightClub
1602 2018-07-31 12:25:32 Looks like there is going to be a huge stock market sell off coming in the next few weeks!
Now that means everyone is going to get all panicky and say THE END IS HERE!
No its not.
Its just a sell off and it happens ALL the time.
But if you have stocks, you might want to watch it.
1603 2018-07-31 12:25:29 US gun companies think of it as threat, so NRA doesn't like it. As 4 making a gun out of those plastics (some metal parts) its nothing to worry about esp vs say a slamfire pipe gun. Regarding making parts such as mags, stocks and various furniture its interesting and a 'threat'.
1604 2018-07-31 12:25:01 Corporate unif bukas pero wala pa ding stocks 
1605 2018-07-31 12:23:55 Hows that ban on bump-stocks coming?
1606 2018-07-31 12:23:10 $shop results were in line, but right now growth tech stocks have the equivalent of Trump derangement syndrome.  Long term holding so I will cover hedges at the open.  On the positive $rig looks great after their earnings yesterday.
1607 2018-07-31 12:22:29 I think it's good to have mix of div and non div paying stocks.
1608 2018-07-31 12:22:12 do you manually carry and restock stuff or its a desk job and you check the stocks ' o '? im unsure of the proper term too
1609 2018-07-31 12:22:09 It amazes me how these liberal tech giants sit in their ivory towers trashing Trump as the bad guy while they steal wealth from their investors by politically muting anyone they disagree with. If those stocks went to $0.00, I'll be o.k..
1610 2018-07-31 12:21:49 Yeah, sure. Just like he “looked into” banning bump stocks and raising the gun-buying age. Spare me. 
1611 2018-07-31 12:21:33 Just like bump stocks that you did nothing about. You are a shill for the NRA and when they shout you jump.
1612 2018-07-31 12:21:13 I think the era of the FAANG stocks acting in concort is over.

1614 2018-07-31 12:20:35 I agree, but I'm understandably skeptical. You said the same thing about bump stocks after the Las Vegas shooting but didn't follow through.

1616 2018-07-31 12:19:18 still, they aren’t public with their stocks is why there’s cause for concern. none of us know the exact financial health of the company. I wish they’d go public soon or AT LEAST disclose something about their company to reassure fans.
1617 2018-07-31 12:18:44 The yield numbers are equal to or better than forecast. DMS1 + fines + middlings very likely to surpass 300ktpa at some point towards end of next year. 

Add in 300k Ibs of Ta ($30m +) and lowest productions costs as per CG and you have the sleeper of all sleeper Li stocks.
1618 2018-07-31 12:17:34 Hows about the bump stocks ban and the new age limits?  No?   You realize no one believe you will do anything, right?
1619 2018-07-31 12:17:33 Tech weakness has led to 4% outperformance of value over growth stocks in 3 days to 30 July, the most aggressive rotation in more than 9 yrs
1620 2018-07-31 12:17:32 Two stocks is the reason I still have nightmares to this day.
1621 2018-07-31 12:17:13 My best guess is that the @ATFHQ will decide that 3-D printed guns are a "safety hazard" to their owners, and will require that any plans will need to be approved if they are either sold or require a paid membership to download. Same could be done for bump-stocks.
1622 2018-07-31 12:17:00 Neither does bump stocks, semi automatics and are insane or lack there if background checks for guns.
1623 2018-07-31 12:16:40 Yay!!! Thank you!
1624 2018-07-31 12:16:31 Hardly any context in this tweet. I suspect you've spoken to the NRA and they've told you to allow all 3D guns to be printed for free with optional bump stocks if they send off pictures in a MAGA hat.
1625 2018-07-31 12:16:11 HAHAHAHA SAME. Never felt so stupid when I heard gunshots thinking it was someone else and realizing it was my own gun, LOL RIP.   The auto feature is something they should have for pc biiiiig time. Makes it so much less of a hassle to equip gun stocks/picking up items.
1626 2018-07-31 12:14:33 But did he send 33,000 confidential emails on a private server to God knows who? Honestly all 3 candidates sucked ass. But he was definitely the best choice Imo and if you look at our country we are PROSPERING. Unemployment rates are down, stocks are up, foreign relations.

1673 2018-07-31 11:47:56 I’m talking about stuff after the fact. We can’t do anything about the past failures except don’t do them again. Where’s the ban on bump stocks? Why is it legal to share files to produce printed plastic guns?

1678 2018-07-31 11:45:40 I agree that you cannot have "originate-to-distribute" without considerable transparency. Whenever such requirements are lowered, trouble is likely (not only true for ABS, but also for "junior" stocks, German SME bonds etc.)

1687 2018-07-31 11:40:46 Trader Sentiment Patchy But Still Broadly Positive | Webinar
Market sentiment is mixed as the holiday period reduces volumes but traders remain generally upbeat about the outlook for riskier assets such as stocks, with no strong demand for safe haven...
1688 2018-07-31 11:39:05 The equivalent would be looking at a gold mining company, that was going to have its first pour next month, and saying "look it's overvalued, it doesn't even generate any revenue!". 
It's completely missing the point and people rarely invest in AIM stocks for current revenue.

1782 2018-07-31 10:32:54 Piling up distribution, a plethora of stocks breaking down through MAs, lack of setups and breakouts.  All of this points to an environment where one doesn't want to be terribly aggressive. I have one 10% position right now and keeping the rest in reserve.

1795 2018-07-31 10:27:37 Index composition matters a lot.  2008 index had a lot more traditionally ‘low pe’ sectors and stocks as against the current one with traditionally ‘high pe’ sectors like fmcg, Pvt banks and to some extent, autos.

1803 2018-07-31 10:20:02 All this nonsense that the global economy is slowing down is simply ridiculous. We as humans are inclined to be scared of bear markets, that's why 95% of people who commit capital into the market lose it all after 2 years. The fact that financial stocks: $JPM, $GS, $C ---
1804 2018-07-31 10:17:53 But the $SPX and aggressive stocks thrive during this time temporarily. When the yield curve is inverted, aggressive stocks like technology, discretionary, and finance continue to outperform the market for at least 2-3 years after this occurs. ----

1819 2018-07-31 10:02:27 There's plenty of ways to make money in the markets imo - I think what's important is to find something that works for you and suits your personality, FA, TA or matching stocks to the lunar calendar or whatever.

1823 2018-07-31 09:57:44 So two stocks take a dive and that makes the stock market as volatile as crypto? What a load of shit. Publically traded stocks typically have a thing called "inherent value" which most cryptos do not.

2021 2018-07-31 06:57:15 “The top 5 stocks have greater market cap than the next 495 - sure sign of a market top!”
“The top #stocks are badly underperforming the other 495, bringing their valuations more into line. DEFINITELY a market top!”
Can we just pick a narrative & stick to it, folks?

2027 2018-07-31 06:51:27 Well, stocks do rise because of confidence in the rupee that is gained. People are linking it with IK's speech--but at this point, it has nothing to do with it. If it was any other party in power, the Rupee would have gone up anyways.

Usually, such a run up can be tenuous. #StockMarket #Sensex #StocksToWatch #TuesdayThoughts

1) "Big Tech" Stocks are not tanking. Thats just Facebook

2084 2018-07-31 06:05:36 Investors tend to over-analyze when stocks are going down (fear) and under-analyze when stocks are going up (greed). The hardest part of investing is holding through these times, embracing boredom and inactivity, and distancing human nature-emotions.

How much capital is required ?

30 to 60 days option premiums are relatively very low for the strong dividend stocks.   You would have to sell an absurd amount of options requireing large capital balance and take on large risk

2296 2018-07-31 03:20:56 Do observe around you whatever you are consuming on a day to day basis and understand it's entire value chain right from root till end product. 

It's an easy way to find evergreen stocks that become great compounders with time.
2297 2018-07-31 03:20:33 Not only would that suck in general, but I'd be wary that a big cut in capital-gains tax could precipitate a major sell-off of stocks. (Don't know if that was mentioned in the NYT article - not being a subscriber, I can't read it.)
2298 2018-07-31 03:20:08 The intricate links between debt, interest rate, over valued stocks and currencies are all too important to ignore in bubbling economy. As in the 1930s, the resulting effects were overcapacity, drop in aggregate demand and unemployment.
2299 2018-07-31 03:19:19 I know what you're talking about. But 6 months ago he had suretrader. Suretrader trades CFDs not shares. So when he opens/closes positions, it wont affect the shares of the stocks. I trade with tradenet and it's the same thing. Trading CFDs. I also don't affect the volume.

2390 2018-07-31 02:29:18 @petedoom I think it was you that got bashed on for stating that you do not hold stocks like $bioaq during the news. I for one will not make this mistake again! Live you learn suck it up and get back at it! Much respect!
2391 2018-07-31 02:29:10 Technical chart analysis in crypto is akin to chart analysis in stocks. It has roughly the same level of science as a palm reading.
2392 2018-07-31 02:28:39 Not to worry, their stocks are dropping. I'm sure advertisers can see when their ads are being blocked by conservatives

2402 2018-07-31 02:24:37 The majority of Americans are invested in individual stocks, mutual funds, pensions or retirement plans like a 401K. They all participate in the rise of the stock market. Stop the fear/anger with a false headline.
2403 2018-07-31 02:24:31 This our #WestCoast treasure for life, culture and families. Open-net #salmonfarms spreading sea lice, disease and toxic waste are still a huge threat. Get them out of the water so our wild stocks can swim free.
2404 2018-07-31 02:23:21 Makes no sense to index the original price. So net, another gift to the property owning class. (And I own property and some stocks. But gains are gains, which are already tax-advantaged anyway).
2405 2018-07-31 02:23:16 Ghost month..let's see if true talaga stocks wl continue to dive = maybe buy 
2406 2018-07-31 02:23:10 Because you tweet the word "Trump" & follow conservatives.

2408 2018-07-31 02:22:31 $AWX is Exhibit 8174934 on why you don't chase stocks. There's literally thousands of charts out there, which means thousands of other opportunities.
2409 2018-07-31 02:22:24 Agree however not all Lithium stocks just raised $1.1bil above $1 stock price. Is a reverse coming? NMX not at this level since 2015. Am I missing something?
2410 2018-07-31 02:21:35 Capital gains, however are gains on real property (home, stocks, etc. ).   It doesn’t make sense to index the original cost. You paid what you paid. You either lost money on the investment, stayed even with inflation, or made more than inflation.
2411 2018-07-31 02:20:43 Opportunity knocks.  Stocks in the tech sector are going down but fundamentals are still good which means that buying opportunity is emerging.  If you have been waiting for your chance to get in the market...  it's coming!  #StockMarket #StockMarketnews #makemoney #Invest

2418 2018-07-31 02:15:42 The sad thing is if he put as much work into scamming people as he did learning to trade real stocks. The stocks he typically trades have few borrows at certain times of the day, not 50k shares anytime you want. And we all know these penny stocks eventually crash, perfect scheme.

2437 2018-07-31 02:00:27 Failure like inheriting an economy in recession. Stocks rose from under 7,000 to almost 20,000, unemployment over 10% down to almost 4%, more jobs created than Trump in same period. Ended the recession.

2445 2018-07-31 01:56:23 I love trading big dog tech stocks.  If you can't afford options on the big dogs then look at QQQ and XLK.  Be sure to watch these and understand their movements before just jumping in.  Each stock and ETF has its own personality and once you know it you can profit from it.
2446 2018-07-31 01:54:49 What I am thinking about is setting up a group of individuals that brings together their top 3 stocks everyday... You give us a 5 word to 20 word reason why this is on watch for the next day. No discussion, boasting or pumping.

Give the ideas the night before and recap.
2447 2018-07-31 01:54:26 Paulie....REAL reports show buy backs, raises for upper management and cashing out of stocks. STOP LYING .

2455 2018-07-31 01:49:21 Wage growth is flat or down from last year, belying the tax cut argument that corps would spend the newfound money on wages for workers. But corps are buying back stocks (to increase share price) benefitting the people whose wealth comes from passive stock investments. The rich.

2457 2018-07-31 01:49:04 64% of Americans own homes. More than half own stocks. The sale of either type of asset for a profit would benefit from the described cut. I guess the best news about your tweet is that up to 64% of Americans are considered wealthy.

2459 2018-07-31 01:47:55 $FAT is the most pathetic of all the lithium stocks hands down. Excuse after excuse for its failures. You might as well wipe your ass with your money before you lose it to this company on its way out the door.
2460 2018-07-31 01:47:11 @svaneksmith In "When Oracles Err," the guest said Keynes was analyzing individual companies, but then you said his idea was to shift to stocks because they were undervalued. Seems like two different concepts (micro vs macro)...am I missing something?
2461 2018-07-31 01:46:29 Two days of back to back selling of Nasdaq stocks after the recent all time high may be aggravated by short selling and panic selling. Cash is a safe position until the market finds its footing unless one is adept in shorting.

2471 2018-07-31 01:38:40 Not true. You can sell stocks all at once. That’s what M&A is. The order books for crypto are too small relative to market cap, and the OTC market can’t cover them either.
2472 2018-07-31 01:38:02 What ever happened to the mentality of being the best at everything you do? Whether it’s working drive thru or flipping stocks be the best and take some pride in what you do

2479 2018-07-31 01:34:40 I don’t disagree, but the loop hole thing is bullshit. Every single firearm I’ve purchased at a gun show has required a 4473 other than a flintlock Kentucky long rifle. He also said “Start with the bump stocks and the gun shows.” Start...So where will it end?
2480 2018-07-31 01:34:37 trading what you understand is a good thing ;) I tend to stick with about 50 stocks I like and just rotate between them based on sector and company strength. I know a few folks who literally just trade one stock in and out all day because they know exactly how it behaves intraday
2481 2018-07-31 01:33:06 Transportation stocks -airlines, trucking, delivery services , marine transportation & railroads..Only railroads are doing good..Everything else is showing flashing red signals as of now in weekly charts..

2492 2018-07-31 01:22:30 European stocks fell from a six-week high on Monday, with troubles surrounding the technology sector and global trade weighing on markets.
Heineken fell 5.3% as the brewer pointed to a strong euro and its business in Brazil as reasons for slashing its margin forecast.
2493 2018-07-31 01:21:32 US stocks fell on Monday as a third straight session in the red for technology stocks helped to push the tech-laced Nasdaq Composite Index to its lowest close in more than three weeks

2514 2018-07-31 01:03:27 Wow. That’s some shitty math. First of all, almost 6m ppl work in health insurance. That would add 6m to unemployment. And those insurance companies are publicly traded. Stocks, indexes, 401k’s, IRA’s, and pensions would plummet. It’s more than line item costs.

2518 2018-07-31 01:00:29 One thing you will learn very quickly on Twitter and Hotcopper is that folk are quick to announce they bought stocks (conveniently at or near the very lowest price AFTER the fact) but do not announce when they are selling, in fact their last post is usually a "XXX is awesome!" ;)
2519 2018-07-31 01:00:01 @jack is to worried about Twitters stocks crashing.
2520 2018-07-31 00:59:50 But banks didn’t lend to the middle class because the net interest margin was so low. Also, the middle class received almost no income on their savings while the low rates inflated the value of stocks and luxury real estate.

2522 2018-07-31 00:59:03 Nope - The stocks in the CPP investment fund pay out dividends, the bond holdings pay out interest - all combine to meet the payments to CPP eligible pensioners.    That’s how pensions work - they are not Ponzi schemes - they have to invest to generate returns.
2523 2018-07-31 00:58:30 And Twitter stocks say, “I’ll tumble for ya, I’ll tumble for ya, I’ll tumble for ya. I’ll tumble for YOU”. Good luck with this new “non biased” solution. You’re going to need it.

2528 2018-07-31 00:55:03 Theyre using those tax cuts to buy their own stocks, likely because of the actual state of the economy under Trump's administration, hence they need more tax cuts to be able to cover up the state of the economy as it gets even worse.
2529 2018-07-31 00:55:01 It's probably pitman33.  Some jerkoff who used to use that handle bashing stocks with an avatar of a cat with a lime peel helmet.  If I was a gambling man I'd bet that's him.  Anything to get attention.  In th actual world he probably has the social graces of a wet brick.
2530 2018-07-31 00:54:42 3 stocks cause why would any sane person ever want 2? 

More of a chance to turn the game, sometimes it takes 2 stocks/more time for someone to ramp up to their real play/feel the pressure. 

In the words of a noob casual (:

2534 2018-07-31 00:52:24 That's like saying wise investors buy growth stocks. Enron was a growth stock until it wasn't. Detroit was a growth city until it wasn't.

You can't beat the market, but you can maximize return while minimizing variance by diversifying.
2535 2018-07-31 00:51:57 Ha ha ha OMG ha ha ha... I'd cash your stocks in now. This is another nail in the coffin for Twitter.
2536 2018-07-31 00:51:46 More like a Bob Ross. Let’s just paint over those previous year ending stocks with happy trees...

2538 2018-07-31 00:51:09 I don’t think the class action lawsuit that was just filed for eavesdropping on DM’s has shown up in the market price yet. It could still get much worse going forward for Twitter. Take your losses now and use it to offset gains in other stocks at tax time.
2539 2018-07-31 00:50:58 My mom tells me trading stocks is gambling . That would be true if I lost more than I was earning , but that’s not the case , I just make sure when I loose I loose small and when I win I win big. $100 loss on the day plus a lesson learned .

2550 2018-07-31 00:44:03 Stocks have valuations based upon industry metrics, which guarantees a floor because yields increase as price drops even with slippage. What are the metrics for tokens?
2551 2018-07-31 00:43:02 US investors are falling away from the tech sector after a string of disappointing quarterly statements. While macro-economic data remains broadly positive the re-adjustment to a more realistic assessment of the tech outlook is weighing on stocks @MicMcCarthy_CMC

2562 2018-07-31 00:28:18 2 stocks was a mistake we should never make again. 3 stocks was and will always be perfection
2563 2018-07-31 00:28:05 if I had held onto just one of those stocks...say..hmmm....PCLN? (I actually took a loss on this way back when)... imagine holding 3k shares of PCLN from the mid 90s until now ...(which is exactly why Im HODL crypto)
2564 2018-07-31 00:26:55 Totally agree. I think if I have to pick only one metric when picking stocks, it would be FCF growth.

2570 2018-07-31 00:24:00 Especially right now, with the economy due to implode in the next year. In a downturn, cash is king. I wouldn't turn cash into stocks now (except as part of a long-established dollar-cost-averaging plan) to save my life.

2576 2018-07-31 00:19:25 we all have different strategies & opinions on stocks we like or dislike, main thing is if someone feels they can profit from a stock and they can i'm always happy for them, no matter whose pick it is, i enjoy seeing people make money because they are examples that it can be done
2577 2018-07-31 00:17:56 Impressive that no one on Twitter is long any FAANG stocks, but even more so that everyone is long value.
2578 2018-07-31 00:17:30 So social media stocks, particularly Facebook & Twitter, have had a rough time of it lately. I think this is as much to do with algos & momentum as as it is of re-balancing of portfolios. When sentiments change I think these stocks could well be a great buying opportunity.

2582 2018-07-31 00:16:50 Governments are still trying to figure out how to tax crypto investments. If it were taxed like stocks/bonds from a company based overseas, any investment income and capital gains would be subject to US tax and in addition, the firm's home country could also tax the individual.

2592 2018-07-31 00:06:06 As a guy who holds plenty of stocks sitting on thousands in capital gains, this is one of the dumbest, most unjustified ideas I can think of. Indexing certain financial concepts to inflation makes sense. This doesn’t.
2593 2018-07-31 00:05:38 -Game promotes aggressive play.

-all forms of dodging got nerfed heavily.

-Edguarding and lack of magnet hands will end stocks incredibly fast.

- 1v1 damage increased making the pace match, so 1v1 and 2v2 will have the same stocks now with similar pacing.
