33 2018-09-05 22:47:49 @readJerome There has been this talk about Africa rising. You ask yourself what has Been the major driving factor of growth. Two things. Rising commodities prices occasioned by the rise and strength of China and India growth, second was rising debt. After Paris and London club
34 2018-09-05 22:46:04 Agree.  Wall Street knows it makes more money selling high margin, opaque securities than low margin, transparent securities.  Wall Street knows opacity lets it rig markets (think Libor for interest rates, aluminum for commodities, etc...).

36 2018-09-05 22:37:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
37 2018-09-05 22:30:34 6.4% inflation rate! There seems no stopping the increase in the prices of basic commodities. Not even the amnesty revocation of Sen Trillanes can hide and divert the fact that the people are complaining. Train 1 is anti-poor.
38 2018-09-05 22:25:56 Shorter rotation means more crossings. Plus regs mean more expensive boats requiring a greater return. 

And 'Ull has a) the infrastructure b) spreads itself over a variety of commodities and c) the throughput.
39 2018-09-05 22:15:44 They do correlate. It's capitalism. The Invisible Hand decides what commodities are worth. Fighting for Bell is fighting for yourself. Foster/Villanueva/Pouncey should be supporting Bell instead of bitching that they make less. They get more if Bell gets more. That's the point
40 2018-09-05 22:11:39 The corporate definition of love is obsessed with commodities, property, and hoarding of things and experiences.
41 2018-09-05 22:11:25 Não adianta pegar e fazer revisionismo histórico barato. 
Você não julga o quanto foi danoso um governo antes dele entrar em ascensão. Mas sim, depois. E veja só o rombo que o PT deixou no país, depois de se aproveitarem de trouxas como você e das commodities inclusive.
42 2018-09-05 22:09:00 Capitalism commodities EVERYTHING including racial struggles, see the recent Kapernick/Nike thing.  Your struggle, your revolution, it will be bought and then it will be sold..UNLESS your struggle and your revolution is one against the very system that dictates buying and selling

47 2018-09-05 21:22:09 It is really hard to tell if @JustinTrudeau cares more for 15,000 farmers getting above-market prices for dairy commodities or the 300,000 FT existing O/S jobs and 15,000-25,000 new jobs associated with the Trans Mountain expansion, receiving below-market prices.
48 2018-09-05 21:19:31 Not really, it is one of the commodities
49 2018-09-05 21:17:39 Just cut him, too late to get something for him. Take the loss, and move on. Roster spots are precious commodities and you can’t hold one just in case he decides to play.  #leveonbell
50 2018-09-05 21:05:51 Sometimes it speaks volumes when, even after getting what it wants a commodity/equity still sells off. Just as some equities/commodities can do no wrong, due to pure momentum, inversely, the effort required to turn the switch the momentum is more than can be reasonably provided.
51 2018-09-05 20:56:28 So, gold and silver collateral is not keeping up with printing paper.  So, other commodities are being used as collateral.  Is that what you are saying?
52 2018-09-05 20:52:30  Think Mitro will prove to be a standout option given how focal he is to everything Fulham do offensively, but Zaha and Arnie are proven commodities.

58 2018-09-05 20:34:35 I really do fear for Kenya. Whatever is going on isn't good!! This hiking of prices in commodities is a bad indicated!!
59 2018-09-05 20:32:02 (2/2) As for the drop in the commodities market coffee pricing you mentioned, as a specialty roaster, our price is not tied 1:1 to that market, in fact our philosophy is to offer fixed long-term contracts to farmers whenever possible. Please reach out if you have more questions!

61 2018-09-05 20:20:06 It seems some economies always create some form of buffer to fall on when they hit hard times. In our world we usually cut jobs and increase prices of basic commodities. The next 3 months are extremely crucial.

69 2018-09-05 19:56:48 I wouldn’t go as far as saying that I am part of a cult. That’s a pretty aggressive accusation. I like to have a well rounded view on the economy and future trends. Another big name to toss in with those two is Ray Dalio. Take a look at what he thinks about gold and commodities
70 2018-09-05 19:55:16 Yeah, I had the same issue. You can change the colours around, but then it doesn't match any of the reference material.

Anyway, was just wondering if it was the same indicator, updated. 

I still use the old one on commodities and stocks...
71 2018-09-05 19:50:17 Prices of commodities is fake news

If u are in Harare u would knw by now that it's all lies from Chicken closing to price hikes

Expect a intense bitchslap from the market. Commodities will remain so, no added value.
79 2018-09-05 19:27:16 Tru and add to that some level of secrecy. Accountability n transparency have become rare commodities, they come in as a privilege.
80 2018-09-05 19:25:25 The concern that I have when it comes to tokenizing commodities is that you still need a trusted party like an audit firm that confirms the physical availability of the good. Audit firms could be further incentivized to stay honest by forcing them to own the underlying tokens.
81 2018-09-05 19:21:40 Ample supply is due to technology and low rates are the another symptom - productivity growth is decreasing over time and it is very good for Commodities as a class right now. Grand solar minimum increases probability of weather shocks.

86 2018-09-05 19:04:33 The kumira kumira slogan in central Kenya has turned to kuumia kuumia because the price of fuel and other basic commodities like unga is affecting all people. Their temporary stalls in githurai and roysambu areas have also been flattened by the same kumira kumira government.

89 2018-09-05 18:54:09 It's not unusual to struggle to explain daily market moves, whether you are in equities, fixed income, or commodities.  But when several large cap coins drop 15% in a matter of hours, and there is no agreement as to why, then what we have is a broken #crypto market.  #bitcoin
90 2018-09-05 18:49:22 Open markets and increasing prices of the commodities, reducing import duties on machine because we got to mechanize agriculture to be competitive and lastly promote innovation and technoly
91 2018-09-05 18:49:03 Haha you were thinking of going full BAW and load up on commodities?
92 2018-09-05 18:43:07 Important to note: my intention wasn't to say commodities aren't likely to outperform equities in the near future. Just pointing out how investors were caught on the wrong foot by loading up on EM early this year.

95 2018-09-05 18:11:32 For a nation to grow it need to treat its masses as invaluable and in expensive commodities. Same applies to the businesses if they intend to grow they must treat their customers as the best that they ever had.
96 2018-09-05 18:11:31 The mid-August lows for gold bullion at US$1,184, for copper at US$2.56 and for crude oil at US$64 may have signaled the multi-year capitulation lows for most commodities. A test of these bottoms may be necessary but it looks to me that the lows have been set.
97 2018-09-05 18:09:37 Whether it’s gold vs fiat or vs other commodities you’re seeing fluctuation during times of war which makes sense. Over the long term gold holds it value.
98 2018-09-05 18:09:23 @arunjaitley You would say don’t panic on fuel prices ; but Govt cares least for the people when everything has become costly n you won’t reduce taxes; that’s being very rude to the entire country who has voted BJP for #AcheDin which is high price rise of commodities n life spend

105 2018-09-05 17:48:27 Commodities are not Equities - technology improvements lead to rising Equities and falling Commodities over the long term
106 2018-09-05 17:47:49 Just explained in other post.  

$USD up -> bad for commodities
$USD up & $JPY down or flat, driving $USDJPY up, which is good for Japan exports, hence good for Equities.
107 2018-09-05 17:45:39 It is all relative.

Strong dollar would be strong headwinds for all of the commodities. Hence driving down all the commodity currencies: $AUD, $NZD, $YUAN and $EUR, which would be bad for the equities

But, if $USD up, but, $JPY down or flat, then $USDJPY up, good for equity.

109 2018-09-05 17:41:40 Why can't they all be opened? The way it is for all other commodities that aren't on supply management. And to be clear, I don't just mean dairy. Dairy seems to get picked on worst in this issue, but aren't the only SM.
110 2018-09-05 17:40:06 Commodities tip: buy heavily into thistle futures!

111 2018-09-05 17:38:14 Except it's not the milk that is the fidget spinner, it's the cows. If demand is low reduce the herd, if demand is high increase the herd. All of agriculture produces perishable commodities, not just dairy.

120 2018-09-05 17:20:42 Agreed, if anything, it’s compatible with capitalism & is a useful tool for the bourgeoisie to justify further state repression. Plus, looted items aren’t collectively used by the proletariat in a way that builds solidarity, they end up as commodities on the black market.

125 2018-09-05 17:12:37 Rising wages!? Nope! Unemployment is following an 8 year track.GDP is not at Obama's numbers yet and once the panic purchase of commodities because of the tariffs goes away, I'll guess for next months GDP numbers, 2.8 if that. Black unemployment under Trump, down .9% and back up.

128 2018-09-05 17:08:52 That’s the harsh reality when dealing in athletic commodities.
129 2018-09-05 17:03:16 But tax paid on petrol reaches 100% to govt, if we reduce it and increase taxes on other commodities it won't reach 100%.

133 2018-09-05 16:50:29 But some commodities are worth more than others, right? If actual money is out of the question and people are paid only in resources, how will people of different professions not get paid more resources than others?

148 2018-09-05 16:02:51 They are a lot of commodities in kenya there prices can be increased and no one will complain so Government should consider that I always expect government to stand with his people than running away from them.
149 2018-09-05 16:02:29 What we are seeing is a culmination of monetary ( corporate) interests as they become the backbone of international foreign policy. It’s about fiscal bottom lines, where ‘other’ human life is the most expendable of commodities.
150 2018-09-05 15:53:51 With recent reports that the farm economy is projected to decline 13% this year, a timely farm bill with a robust commodity title is more important that ever. H.R. 2 maintains strong reference prices across all commodities, including Southern long grain rice. #2018FarmBill

194 2018-09-05 13:50:17 Disagree.  Bottleneck to the whole system of financialized commodities & USD is physical gold.  China knows this (phys flows fr west to east last 5 yrs are big & ongoing), EU knows this (repatriated last 5 yrs), Russia knows this (buying gold, selling USTs).  Phys is finite.
195 2018-09-05 13:48:49 It sorta was...Slavery existed under a capitalist economy. Slaves were commodities sold on the market, the things slaves produced were sold in the free market. The problem wasn’t capitalism though, it was the view that you could own another human as property.
196 2018-09-05 13:46:26 Slaves had no options to leave.  They were sold and bought as commodities.

231 2018-09-05 12:03:28 Why fuel prices increase?  Commodities are sold in dollars in the global markets and we have to buy dollars first with N$ to get a barrel of oil which is used to refine biofuels like petrol, diesel etc.

233 2018-09-05 11:58:42 the real reason the whole "pedo guy" incident has upset Musk's PR guys so much, is because he's essentially just gone and alienated his whole Rothbardite and (ironically) teenage libertarian core by suggesting that children are anything more than commodities to begin with

238 2018-09-05 11:42:44 i hate this government. inflation rate’s at 6% so even the most basic of all commodities will be a struggle to buy for the filipino. is it then really the poor’s fault they’re poor in the first place?
239 2018-09-05 11:42:07 This is not funny.  The government must step in and stop this nonsense, basic commodities must be Regulated otherwise criminals and thieves will take advantage and abuse the citizens.

245 2018-09-05 11:27:06 A daily wage of $0.26 clearly implies that whatever food people eat on a daily basis is not paid for in currency, so most food and other commodities are either rationed or exchanged off the books somehow.  Those details are where the real story is told.  Not the wage number.

287 2018-09-05 08:32:58 The decision to introduce new taxes on basic commodities like fuel (16% VAT) and fuel products might actually not lead to increased tax collection. But I doubt if they will relent even if the last tax payer was chocking to death, they will tax their graves!
288 2018-09-05 08:22:26 A responsible and compassionate Government would have announced mitigation measures that will cushion citizens from the rising cost of basic commodities. Kenya is led by callous criminals.

300 2018-09-05 06:52:01 A subdued return for US markets after Labour Day: DJI slightly lower, NASDAQ -0.4%. No visibility on a Canadian trade deal kept risk off and the $ rose again, putting pressure on commodities with gold's short bounce curtailed (back below $1200).
UK shares to drift lower again.
301 2018-09-05 06:50:42 Put a maximum cap on salaries so company bosses can only earn 10x more than the lowest paid employer. This will distribute wealth and commodities better and take away the urge to limit advances in pharmaceutical companies and technology companies
302 2018-09-05 06:48:56 Cannot read the forum, site down for maintenance. Money does not have fixed value... and it's good store of value because of it's liquidity. However other commodities can be used as store of value like precious metals.

349 2018-09-05 04:48:29 And it is very true. And instead of creating jobs, we are actually exporting jobs to China because of the exportation of primary commodities.
350 2018-09-05 04:44:25 that's true, by adding VAT on fuel means that all other commodities that were exempted from VAT earlier are now being charged VAT in disguise it's a game that Kenyans are tired of playing
351 2018-09-05 04:38:42 Adidas was down 2.41% at lunch. As well as many other major brands as a whole. Many of the materials used in shoes had been losing on the day in the commodities. And half, really? In the Global Nike Market? We both know that Stocks are more about feelings than bottom line. JS.
352 2018-09-05 04:30:34 food is a commodity.
commodities and essential services are not mutually exclusive.
353 2018-09-05 04:29:18 How does a barter system apply to the service industry.. I'll take your 100 pounds of barley for 1 years internet subscription. What if you produce something they don't want. If deals are cut between individuals what is to stop a commodities based merchantism from forming.
354 2018-09-05 04:17:25 Let them display the audios of BJP RSS leaders including Modi speeches before 2014 regarding rising of prices of petrol and commodities and fall of rupee against dollar. It is sufficient to bring out the hypocrisy and racism of BJP
355 2018-09-05 04:13:56 Ravichandran. Even keeping money in an Fixed deposit with a bank is gamble, as banks have high NPAs. Keeping money at home is a gamble,.as your house can get robbed.
I paid through my bank account to #NSEL for commodities and  VAT on it. How smart are you before getting robbed?
356 2018-09-05 04:11:29 Just reduce the taxes the state charges on fuel and other essential commodities and reduce expenditure of the government, instead of bribing people through gifting Cell phones. Most people are capable of buying their own phone.
357 2018-09-05 04:09:45 I dont really know much about precious metals and commodities im mostly just a pennystock guy. But i would think since market has been up, gold is down at the moment
358 2018-09-05 04:07:31 It's utter hogwash. You can't tax yourself to prosperity. At least not when 50% of that tax gets plundered anyway and it raises the prices of essential commodities, reduces savings and disposable incomes. Just stop wastage, that's the solution.
359 2018-09-05 04:05:40 NCR inflation at 7%. National inflation at 6.4%.
Rice shortage. Higher prices of commodities. Tapos 400 ang ginastusan nating mga taga gobyerno na pumunta sa Israel.
360 2018-09-05 04:05:39 Agreed, but my take on your question was the “official” money we have, $. (Or any countries official currency as what is typ defined as money.) that’s why other commodities swing to >it<, they are not considered “money”.
361 2018-09-05 04:05:26 When we no longer view others as commodities it shifts our viewpoint dramatically regarding these matters. Freedom is a constant.
362 2018-09-05 04:05:18 kawawa the ordinary folks..

Wait.. I have to correct myself.  Kawawa tayong lahat.  Because prices now of commodities are crazy.  We're all affected.
363 2018-09-05 04:04:56 Very true. And our leaders do need not to rely on primary commodities in exportation, we need to widen to manufacturing and so forth. For a greater Zimbabwe there is need for change in the running of the countries business.

364 2018-09-05 04:01:32 #overall prices of basic commodities are lowest in Modi raj,inflation is in single digit ,but pro Sonia media is creating opposite picture as they does in all other issue.
365 2018-09-05 04:00:52 Sir you hv time to tweet for condolence message. But you hv no time to speak in today burning issue. What a great PM of my country. Sir u r not serious about high price of essential commodities and petroleum product. poor education system. poor health condition.poor farmers. Pl
366 2018-09-05 03:59:44 Anong kaguluhan ito?
#TrillanesAmnesty Malay natin baka sakaling bumaba ang presyo ng basic commodities, etc. etc. kung maipakulong si Sen Trillanes. Ano na my country Philippines? 
367 2018-09-05 03:57:59 Ay triggered ako, I posted a status about the August Inflation rate on fb tapos may DDS nagcomment na si Mar na lang daw sana nanalo para adik na lahat ng Pinoy pati aso. Don’t me. They would really rather talk about the anti-drug campaign than the PRICES OF BASIC COMMODITIES!
368 2018-09-05 03:54:54 Ang " pagbabago" na gusto ng mga dds ay itong pagmamahal ng presyo ng lahat ng basic commodities, klaro yan kasi dutae pa rin mga utak!!!
369 2018-09-05 03:54:49 Yes you “need to make the right picks” but odds on draft picks are not in your favor. Why take dart throws over proven commodities? If all you want is cap space and a couple darts, I can get you more than two darts on ARob and Ajayi alone and you don’t have to take “rentals.”
370 2018-09-05 03:53:57 There is no cement in the country. Prices of basic commodities have gone up. Pride????
371 2018-09-05 03:53:29 the high inflation rate, high prices of rice and other basic commodities. where are you living, mars?
372 2018-09-05 03:52:46 Peru #Copper output fell 5.2%y/y to 195,584 tons in july. Production from Las Bambas, Cerro Verde production fell 2.4%y/y and 11.3% y/y respectively. #Metals #Commodities
373 2018-09-05 03:51:30 Its only in Kenya where leaders speak about creating job opportunities and growing economy in political rallies but end up making life harder for the jobless by increasing tax on basic commodities!
374 2018-09-05 03:49:25 @ImranKhanPTI Increase in gas tariff @46pc, will further disrupt lives of common men. We r looking forward to see prices of commodities lowering, jobs, stable rupee, good economic conditions, better health and education facilities. Eliminate mafia in edu system.
375 2018-09-05 03:40:37 Basic commodities sir.
376 2018-09-05 03:38:38 I used to trade those on the Commodities Market, back in the day. Looks like bacon.
377 2018-09-05 03:37:30 This is the same Greg, that just put up a chart showing the correlation between the AUD and commodities, like he'd just invented a new indicator. On the one hand you are say inflation is anaemic, we must cut & on the other u say bad data cos inflation is higher than that.
378 2018-09-05 03:35:18 Hindi naman po si Sonny Angara ang may kasalanan ng inflation. There are many factors like prices of commodities in global markets, natural inflation and mismanaged fiscal policies by the current administration. Si Angara is only a lawmaker not at implementor
379 2018-09-05 03:33:34 JUST IN:

The inflation rate has reached 6.4 percent for August 2018, the highest since March 2009. This is according to the Philippine Statistics Authority. 

Inflation rate refers to the increase in the prices of commodities over a specific period of time.
380 2018-09-05 03:33:31 US markets closed flat with negative bias....

US dollar index above 95 mark.

Commodities prices witnessed strong selling pressure except Crude OIL prices.
381 2018-09-05 03:25:29 What? That the productive forces in China are leaps and bounds ahead of what they were when the country first opened up? That huge swaths of American commodities come from the country? How is basic criteria for what constitutes socialism incorrect here?
382 2018-09-05 03:15:38 Como confundes los términos económicos. Crecimiento existe la diferencia en que sustenta crecimiento si en commodities o valor agregado es lo que quieres decir. Pero es incorrecto que digas que Singapur no tiene crecimiento
383 2018-09-05 03:15:27 @narendramodi @AmitShah @BJP4India if you still believe that you are going to win 2019 easily then please open your eyes bfr its too late. The prices of fuel and other commodities are sky rocketing. Do something fast. 35A, 370, SC St act have already done enough dmg.

387 2018-09-05 03:05:59 Kaya pa raw ng mga Ka DeDeEs.  Pwede pa raw pagtyagaan ang nagmahahalang presyo ng rice at other basic commodities.
388 2018-09-05 02:53:40 I don't see it as often as I used to but you are right many fall for it and it's not gone unfortunately. Still plenty of snake oil salesmen out there. Can see through the U crap but other commodities maybe not as clearly. Always cautious & important to keep people aware.Good post
389 2018-09-05 02:38:44 today the value of commodities relative to equities is at the lowest point in close to 50 years!
390 2018-09-05 02:37:07 MODI may be choice for future PM of millions . Won't rising prices of petrol and diesel, dipping of value of rupee against dollar, unemployment, resentment of central government employees & masses,  rising prices of commodities and inflation take it's toll in coming elections

392 2018-09-05 02:27:35 Before I was more than happy to give my 10% income tax. It was a burden but prices of commodities were cheap. Poorer ppl could afford them. But now I don't pay IT, but the necessities' prices doubled.
393 2018-09-05 02:22:31 Inflation is 6.4% 
Rice is P40-P80
Peso - Dollar P53.58
Basic Commodities - Rising Sharply
No adequate NFA rice available for the marginalized 

These are the matters that should be focused on not this uncalled and unnecessary noise

395 2018-09-05 02:09:54 Inflation is rising; the prices of goods and basic commodities are soaring;  our economy is faltering. The path we are heading to is clear. Should we wait until we end up like Venezuela? When will we act?  When will we march?, When will we scream, enough is enough?
396 2018-09-05 02:06:02 @PMOIndia I predict a thorough defeat for BJP if it ignores fuel price and LPG. both are essential commodities and damaged d budget of the struggling middle classes who voted you en masse for BJP
397 2018-09-05 01:57:14 But so you’re sayin they are ahead of the curve in the action of trading picks for know commodities, not that they are ahead of the curve in performance as a franchise
398 2018-09-05 01:38:21 I am confused if you are blind or just foolish. The government can trick you by changing the way inflation and GDP growth is calculated but if you are paying for commodities and you believe that prices have actually reduced you can only be a bhakt.
399 2018-09-05 01:37:49 Hello Prabu,

Yes, with the core skills of price action context and that order flow behind it, you can trade any market. I trade everything from stocks/futures/options/commodities/global indices/CFD's and Forex, all using price action.

Hope to be working with you soon.
400 2018-09-05 01:24:05 All ag commodities need to have a value at the supermarket. Period. The supermarkets need to get past the loss-leader principle and play fair.
401 2018-09-05 01:23:02 I don’t think it helps that commodities are performing horribly. Hopefully a nice run when things turn around.
402 2018-09-05 01:19:46 Egypt's General Authority for Supply Commodities (GASC) set a tender on Tuesday to buy an unspecified amount of wheat from global suppliers for shipment from Oct. 21-30.

406 2018-09-05 01:08:14 It's good if your savings are in $US and not planning any foreign travel or buying a bunch of stuff. Commodities are safe or anything priced in $US. Consumers will bear the brunt especially those who can least afford it. The NDP will be happy though no more Dutch disease hey Tom
407 2018-09-05 01:03:17 Trillanes ang ginawang panakip issue ng excessive profiteering sa basic commodities.

409 2018-09-05 00:55:48 The way this party came to power claiming false propaganda that every thing will be bought under control within months, like inflation price rise of essential commodities etc. Even after years they could not do anything about it means they are useless.

411 2018-09-05 00:32:07 If commodities were tokenized could that bypass the problem of currency exchanges between countries
412 2018-09-05 00:25:53 There’s already so many cryptos out there. And none of them have real value until they can be commonly spent or act like commodities
413 2018-09-05 00:25:13 Women are not commodities and they must not be treated as one. There must be a strict law and proper implementation against women abuse and discrimination especially in poor and developing countries...
414 2018-09-05 00:24:17 Thriving? That is the most ridiculous lie I have ever heard. How come our economy is thriving when all the prices of basic commodities r getting higher evryday and many people r getting hungry.

416 2018-09-05 00:03:34 You posted the license no longer exist and now you are claiming they do not say what they say. I do not invest my money is commodities I know nothing about - I broke even, because I held too long.
417 2018-09-05 00:03:15 I thought he was just another typical American politician.
Morals and values are commodities for them to sellout to their donars at the cost of the people.
This is just more proof that everything they say is just bullshit to suit the moment.
If Trumps base ever turns, so will he!
