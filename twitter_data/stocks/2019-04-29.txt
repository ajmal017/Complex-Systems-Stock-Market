1 2019-04-29 23:57:02 Maybe we can simply stop growing food and beef, then there will be lots of water and no one to complain that there’s nothing to eat.

6 2019-04-29 23:53:04 What do you mean by "wages goes into the stocks"?
7 2019-04-29 23:52:38 Hopefully TWLO and SQ ER boost the stocks
8 2019-04-29 23:50:11 Nice morning spike but I don’t like holding stocks overnight that aren’t super close to their hod or setting new highs
9 2019-04-29 23:48:57 Studied the basic and advanced stats of the (arguably) top 26 small guards. Ponds ranks strongly in ORB, AST%, TOV, A:T, STL, STL%, STOCKS, OBPM and BPM; only poorly in 3PAr and maybe could more muscle. He's even young for a junior.
10 2019-04-29 23:48:22 Out of all of uranium stocks I own, the one I hear the least amount about is Azarga Uranium. Wouldn’t mind an interview there.
11 2019-04-29 23:47:50 If investing is so easy then why did Buffett 
sit on his hands 
with $50B in cash 

when the Dow was at

16 2019-04-29 23:45:12 You should have to spend the day in the stocks after comments like that
17 2019-04-29 23:44:41 What's going on @TwitterIndia ? You're losing yourself in this rat race. Planning to crash your stocks and make retirement for your employees tough is it?
18 2019-04-29 23:43:50 The media and adults say we don’t have willpower, condemning us like stocks
