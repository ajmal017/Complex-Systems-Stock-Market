1 2019-01-29 23:59:05 @cvpayne in response to your segment on pot stocks. I got into $IIPR a couple of months ago, a pot REIT. I think $CGC also looks good for a long term play. Your thoughts?

3 2019-01-29 23:58:08 Yup. Saw that on Giggle. But I’ve never had stocks. Apparently I have $$$$ waiting on me.
4 2019-01-29 23:56:20 From what I just read, it's when you cash out partial shares of stocks.
5 2019-01-29 23:56:03 "Stocks? What?"
6 2019-01-29 23:55:36 @Firstrade any plans to support @IEX?

Looks like cheaper trades for you.   Open API means more data for us little people.  Seems pretty awesome.  #stocks
7 2019-01-29 23:54:53 If I knew how to make stocks, that's how I'd make them.
8 2019-01-29 23:53:15 I guess what they mean is: we were able to ban bump-stocks.  Ok, our job here is done. Let’s go home.
9 2019-01-29 23:52:18 Someone at my job asked me when is a good time to buy stocks when it's going up or down. I said both  don't #FOMO
10 2019-01-29 23:52:17 I'm only few episodes in so far of S1, I find him relatable but also feel as though it'd be better if all the bad guys had to face trial or maybe have rotten fruit thrown at them in stocks instead but then I guess you'd have a legal drama rather than an action series

12 2019-01-29 23:51:57 Defender la moneda es bicicleta?

 Eso puede ser para los dolarizados a 40

Ir bajando stocks de leliqs a 7 días al 60% para cambiarlos por lecaps a 1 año al 40% es bicicleta?

$BSBR
14 2019-01-29 23:50:42 Invest in Twitter, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon stocks. You'll thank me later.
15 2019-01-29 23:48:46 A more honest analysis would be to look at who would be affected by a tax on stocks/bonds, what %. I've paid capital gains for sale of a business and the federal rate was lowered. I don't consider capital gains a "double tax" on income. Exemptions for small business owners?
16 2019-01-29 23:48:23 Here in Daytona, a poached-drunk stocks trader just offered to buy me a shot. I’ve known him 2 minutes. He’s holding a FedEx envelope containing some kind of paternity papers. “No, thank you,” I say. He picks up his phone, dials, says, “I’m falling apart.” I’ll be here all week!
