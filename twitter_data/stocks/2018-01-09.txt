No particular order, but this is just what I believe is great. I've seen alot of growth between these companies.
1 2018-01-09 23:59:38 There will be days when your #investment crashes and this is a normal event in stocks or #bitcoin. Be patient, hold, let the dips pass, live your life and stop checking every minute. Over time, these will eventually increase. Don't make the mistake of panic selling during dips.
2 2018-01-09 23:58:22 I'm curious, what stocks did you buy? Happy Investing!
3 2018-01-09 23:57:32 Oh you right I read it wrong my bad. Just noticed. In crypto coins rise and fall 27% every day. Way more volatile and I feel more comfortable trading between that than stocks. Just don't know stocks as well I guess. Also like the gains to be made in crypto as well as the ideas
4 2018-01-09 23:56:21 I don't see this correction as a crash, I see it as a crypto sale. Get in while stocks last.
5 2018-01-09 23:56:20 Which military uses bump stocks? Are grenade launchers a thing for sale now?
The general military doesn't use silencers.

8 2018-01-09 23:52:37 Investing in crypto takes patience. Just like any other type of investment out there... stocks, flipping houses, owning a nee business. The return of investment #ROI can take years before gaining profits. Hold & don't let it consume your lifestyle  #cryptocurrency #investments

12 2018-01-09 23:48:39 apparently boots stocks ponds cold cream cleanser idk if it’s the same thing
13 2018-01-09 23:48:18 Small business optimism soared in 2017. U.S. Stocks hit fresh record highs. Credit card debt hit record highs for Americans in November.

17 2018-01-09 23:46:06 Same as nobody stocks The Sun in Liverpool so in effect, it’s banned. I get it, but I think is it not censorship by the back door?
18 2018-01-09 23:45:26 BTW the 10YR at 2.50 means nothing, its clear to 2.75 and only over 3% does it really start to affect positioning. Most important is TRAJECTORY and speed, rate spike=no beuno, gradual rate rising just fine until 4% clobbers stocks good

39 2018-01-09 23:44:30 I'm not going to lie. I am invested in Weed Stocks, just don't need to make it my only purpose in life.
40 2018-01-09 23:43:17 Where is the Bump Stocks investigation at.
President Pussy Grabber has promised
What are they doing?
41 2018-01-09 23:43:10 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to cure your insomnia
42 2018-01-09 23:43:06 Another super bull. And you thought rising nmbond ymyields would be BAD for stocks???? Hahahhahahahhhh. Nope. Of course. Even that is GREAT for stocks. Jesus chryst. Phukking blind euphoria
43 2018-01-09 23:43:00 No, it often hasn't.  For people with estates large enough to worry about the esate tax, much is appreciated stocks and real estate.  The only time you pay tax is on the sale. But those who inherit get an adjusted basis, so they don't pay on the  actual increased value.
44 2018-01-09 23:42:47 "Stocks for FirstEnergy and for Exelon Corporation, the biggest operator of nuclear plants in the US, were down Tuesday morning." 

Awwwww.
45 2018-01-09 23:42:18 Trading and making big money is as easy as just buying new highs, the only way you get multiple times your $$ moves is to buy new highs whether its coins, stocks, currency or commodities, never fails!
46 2018-01-09 23:38:12 Ok, but if not stocks and gold, where? Make us money!!! ;-)
47 2018-01-09 23:34:53 Agreed (though it creates path that big pharma or tobacco will be the leading producers) So convince @realDonaldTrump to direct @jeffsessions to higher enforcement priorities. Since we're on ATF, bump-stocks, federal ban or no?

52 2018-01-09 23:32:13 Tell me again how you support law enforcement:
1. Letting people with mental illness buy guns
2. Allowing people to purchase silencers 
3. Let people buy bump stocks 
4. Let people purchase military style guns

So this is how?!

54 2018-01-09 23:32:03 OK, but clearly the enumerated right to gun ownership doesn't include bump stocks, which are already prohibited in California. I don't see anyone suing successfully to overturn that under the 2nd Amendment.
55 2018-01-09 23:31:50 Why would shale stocks move? They are only obsessed with increasing production, they will still be FCF negative

57 2018-01-09 23:30:25 Retail investors do not have the experience, time and resources to find good stocks. @AlderLaneeggs shared enough with people so they can invest with confidence. They will not make as much money since they are not professionals. That is absolutely fine.

60 2018-01-09 23:30:14 all these stocks spiking on some ambiguous crypto press release makes me think fiat markets are still seeking a way to long crypto without actually making a call on any particular coin or protocol. ETFs won't solve this for the crypto illeterate

66 2018-01-09 23:25:32 Not going to prevent them from bump firing without the stocks. The stocks make it easier but, it can be done with out them.

71 2018-01-09 23:22:30 Worth considering: looking at Europe as a "country", it's very similar to the USA: broad sector diversification, top 10 stocks = 16% of market cap (based on vanguard's VGK)
72 2018-01-09 23:21:33 fired a couple different guns, not bump firing. but by your own admission, bump firing is less demanding than belt-loop firing. now, I'm perfectly happy making pre-made bump stocks a prescription item for the disabled, if that's your good-faith concern

87 2018-01-09 23:06:18 Which stocks you looking at for tomorrow ?
88 2018-01-09 23:06:11 well, if selling bump stocks that allow people to shoot 600 people in 15 minutes is what it takes to "own the libs," so be it, I guess? Just be careful at country music concerts, Tanstaafl

92 2018-01-09 23:03:15 Sir, your point about banning bump stocks perhaps is valid and you are free to hold a position that says only the military should own ARs. I was a squid in aviation and had about 7 mins pistol training. Bubbleheads 7 mins less. Claims of authority ring hollow.

94 2018-01-09 23:01:32 if that's so easy and cheap, why do companies sell bump-stocks, then?
95 2018-01-09 23:01:25 Everyone who trades stocks has losses. The lesson one learns is not to be carried out on one's shield by too big a loss. I still haven't quite learned that one as hubris and greed takes over on my big bets.

127 2018-01-09 22:45:53 The bond market selloff came as US stocks hit new milestone, another sign rising bond yields are healthy for the economy. WSJ: The S&P 500 has closed at six con­sec­u­tive records in its first six trad­ing ses­sions of 2018, the broad in­dex’s best start since 1964.

131 2018-01-09 22:44:13 It's a commercial decision. Many of their customers are hated by the Daily Mail: working mothers, scientists, LGBT, Muslims, immigrants, judges, charity workers etc. One private company no longer stocks the products of another, nothing to see here, move along.
132 2018-01-09 22:43:30 Remember that I gave you pincher stocks like $ORCL, $FRC, $PCG, $PPL. All 4 stocks are nice today. Cool
133 2018-01-09 22:42:41 Bonds - when Treasury bonds go down, stocks go opposite and rise. Market guru Bill Gross said Treasurys were entering a bear market after a selloff in government paper took yields past key technical levels on Tuesday. Bill is a bond analyst for Janus and is an expert.
134 2018-01-09 22:41:38 NZH headline misrepresents the point of article, which is about how to account for integrated forest benefits. I agree re natives: major reasons is landowner preferences, land resilience/adaptation, biodiversity & increase long-term carbon stocks beyond 2050.

137 2018-01-09 22:40:07 I know nothing lasts forever. The bull market makes everything look easier than the reality.  As a newbie in the stock market, I am wondering how retail traders/ small investors survive in a bear market? Do they short stocks?

140 2018-01-09 22:36:43 I made 3k profit about 15% in $BABA. After selling today, I am not sure whether I did right or wrong.. .

146 2018-01-09 22:34:04 i employ this strategy (plus options) for stocks that i don't know that well, but think they're are a good short/midterm trading op. barely pays the bill though.

153 2018-01-09 22:32:55 I actually went 4 rounds with that Luigi player to get Marth matchup experience. It was really hard but I did score a couple nice tippers on him when he was recovering. Didn't win at all but just taking stocks off players of that level feels good.

156 2018-01-09 22:32:19 Day 2 of #JPM18 is coming to a close (soon-ish) and @damiangarde and I learned a few things about your beloved biotech stocks. Story soon.
157 2018-01-09 22:32:02 What did we hear back then?  
"Now is not the time for this"   (this being talk about guns/clips/bump stocks)
158 2018-01-09 22:31:01 
159 2018-01-09 22:31:01 But even a 4th line giving them a minute or two a night. Put beattie on the 3rd line with finucci and stocks. Isaacs with scoonie and smith to throw there weight around.
160 2018-01-09 22:31:00 US 10 year yield closed above 2.5% and the 2 yr yield is closer to break 2%. The yield curve actually steepens in 2018. Along with higher breakeven, the bond market flashes optimism on growth and a shift out of lowflation. But a bond tantrum could rattle stocks...
161 2018-01-09 22:30:51 If people need others to buy their stocks to make a few quid they've not realised where the big money is. A shame really as there is a lot of £ to be made!
162 2018-01-09 22:30:34 It’s not banned! They have made a commercial decision to no longer stock something they sell very little of.
If racists & bigots like you want to read the Daily Fail on a Virgin Train then I’m sure you will be able to find a newsagents which stocks the tawdry little rag.
163 2018-01-09 22:30:32 Gundlach: "2.63% on the ten-year UST is critical. Will take an 'event' for rate to rise above that level. Would likely be bad for #Stocks " #Economy #Bonds

167 2018-01-09 22:26:57 My watchlist consists of around 200 companies. According to my strategy rules, right now I could buy only 25 of them. 2 yrs ago the number standing was at 40-50. Not the best market for bargain hunters. #StockMarket #stocks #StockMarketInsights #technology
168 2018-01-09 22:26:10 In related news, liquor company stocks took a dive today.
169 2018-01-09 22:25:53 Domino's is one of those stocks where I wish I bought the stock instead of the product over the last many years.
170 2018-01-09 22:25:10 Every 3-5 years the same story. We wayyyy over grow supply. We need %99 ethanol to help get rid of this stocks. Cus we can’t eat enough of it.
171 2018-01-09 22:24:55 What is sad! One time bonuses are nothing in the skim of things. The unfortunate news no one is talking about the companies buying back their stocks at the same time.
172 2018-01-09 22:23:55 Lol people still buy stocks
173 2018-01-09 22:23:05 One of my key parts of strategy - I own the position if I only believe it can potentially go up 100% or more in a few years. All my current 18 longs fit into that. #StockMarket #stocks #StockMarketInsights #technology

175 2018-01-09 22:22:34 #wsj @cnbc so some 5ucky stocks say they are doing some crypto currency things and get stock price boost,and today #Kodak (old photo play) up 120% from $4 after going krypto and this totally kreepy and krazy (bubbles generally go kaput)

182 2018-01-09 22:18:14 We believe that in 2018 the market will realize that volume will mean less & less when judging the strength of a move, that rallies will occur on less and less volume as shares are effectively withdrawn from the float by buybacks & sovereign funds hoard stock.

218 2018-01-09 22:02:58 #Stocks,#Indexes A very minor SPX and NDX top signal at the close, about as temporally compressed as physically possible. So, short signal, short selloff, in this case, expected duration is a few hours, less than 1 day.

264 2018-01-09 21:44:00 I think you have to learn that there’s a company behind every stock, and that there’s only one real reason why stocks go up. Companies go from doing poorly to doing well or small companies grow to large companies.

284 2018-01-09 21:35:16 That's not how ETF Redemption Units work, so it may not mean what you think it does. Any "outflows" from GLD would have an Approved Participant deliver GLD shares and receive ownership of the physical gold from the fund company. Similar with GDX but with stocks.

290 2018-01-09 21:33:27 Starting to shy away from those plays and move to commodities base plays and larger stocks. Headaches from those suck plus the mental capital from trying to find shares to short is enough to make me drink at 10am

297 2018-01-09 21:31:17 I bet on certain penny stocks for fun because they're in emerging industries. If they "just" go up 50 cents I earn 500 dollars on a 10 dollar investment.

304 2018-01-09 21:27:17 A good return by anyone's standards. Given the Medical Cannabis stocks average mkt caps in Canada I would not be surprised to see this go somewhat higher in the near term
305 2018-01-09 21:26:45 $HYG down ... hmmm stocks up? Weird.
306 2018-01-09 21:26:04 It is also worth noting that $VIX was rising all day even as the market was rallying and closed at its highs. Interest rates were also rising all day and are near a 12 month high. #Trading #stocks #Futures
307 2018-01-09 21:25:28 This is normal changing of hands in these OTC stocks. Some of guys who got in low cashed out and some of the flippers who got in a few days ago probably cashed out too. But the  papers are filed for this to become current this week. That will open it up to way more traders.

323 2018-01-09 21:20:10 CNBC just wasted a great interview with bill Miller talking about Bitcoin!!! We want to hear about stocks, companies. NO MORE BITCOIN! If CNBC wants to waste our time with Bitcoin and corrupt stocks like RIOT--create a 30 min segment and we'll turn off the TV!
324 2018-01-09 21:20:01 Puzzling day. Dow and S&P at new records, but breadth negative - 1 to 1.4 and 1 to 1.2. Banks better as 10 yr US Treasury climbed over 2.6%, but continued upward slope might be competition for stocks. Bill Gross, bond guru, believes the jig is up for the bond bull market.
325 2018-01-09 21:19:30 You mean the people who are watching their stocks rise and taxes lowered?  Yeah... We’ll continue to support @POTUS
326 2018-01-09 21:18:57 It has been quite a while. I don't make predictions but what I will say is that as a young, long-term investor you should welcome corrections and crashes because they're simply buying opportunities when stocks are on sale. Every single market crash has been followed by a bull run
327 2018-01-09 21:18:11 In a related story, bourbon and whiskey company stocks took a dive in the market today.
328 2018-01-09 21:17:55 Elvira, you started a position on here recently didn't you? just move on!!! so many stocks to invest!

333 2018-01-09 21:16:24 One of the key things that has helped my trading of stocks, cryptocurrencies and forex is learning better how to minimize losses...doing that plus hitting some "singles" and "doubles" without feeling like it has to be a home run every trade
334 2018-01-09 21:15:57 I wouldnt switch back to @TDAmeritrade they just made a business decision not to display MM ARCA on all OTC stocks. So you will have no idea who your buying from. No thanks
335 2018-01-09 21:15:54 The DOW dropped from 24% in march 2009 at 20%. Yes it grew steady. Never obtained 3gdp. Ethusiam is there u fail to see it, its why stocks growing. JAN 2017 is when stocks started to rocket. 5k record never done. There are more of us remember polls wrong? Forgot? Its dem pooled
336 2018-01-09 21:15:42 This is probably and age old question, but with all these cryptocurrencies and marijuana stocks does anyone else find themselves questioning what the true value of anything is?

337 2018-01-09 21:14:52 CNBC -Kelly-wasting a great interview with Bill Miller talking about Bitcoin and Trump--spare us!!! We want to hear about stocks, companies, the market, SP. HELP! NO to Bitcoin!
338 2018-01-09 21:14:30 3M is on my "watch list" of stocks.  I agree with you...so many investors are after the
"hot" stocks...when so often...a good dividend-paying solid company like 3M is a good investment!
339 2018-01-09 21:13:56 43 million black people in the US, if 1/2 of us, (those not in deep poverty, too young or old), gave $10/yr, you have $160 million/yr to lobby for policy change in DC, to invest in stocks & start businesses. Most black people give away $10/week to their church.

487 2018-01-09 20:19:44 compound this with what you said - the reality that share prices and dividends make stocks attractive to investors and here we are, in a perpetual wealth grab cycle by corporations and the wealthy.

523 2018-01-09 20:09:47 Stocks continue to push higher fueled by robust economic data and expectations of an earnings boost from corporate tax cuts.

526 2018-01-09 20:09:08 Or I give you control of my stocks, you can split them between crypto and day trading and I will cut you 5-25% of the profit you make trading them daily, based on the % of profit compared to initial investment. (example: I make 0-30% profit, nets you 5%, 100%+ you get 25%)

540 2018-01-09 20:05:01 It’s a generational thing to be “numb” instead of approaching it business wise. Their stocks actually went up less than 1 percent due to the amount of traction they got for that
541 2018-01-09 20:04:45 Liberals: We hate the rich, they're greedy! Vote to tax them to hell (so the government can tax us into oblivion).

Also Liberals: (After saying stocks would crash after the election of Trump) Obama is the reason why stocks are skyrocketing (making the already rich, richer).

543 2018-01-09 20:03:56 Good Q from @MatthewNussbaum - asking if there has been any update from the White House on how bump stocks on guns will be regulated?

@PressSec said that the ATF and Dept of Justice is doing a "full review" and WH is anticipating/waiting for those results.
544 2018-01-09 20:03:16 Q: Any update on deciding the regulation of bump stocks?

#SHSanders: The ATF was going to do a review and we’re waiting for them to do that. 

So….no.

567 2018-01-09 19:53:41 If stocks were down he would rightfully be blamed since for the last eight years they've been steadily climbing.
568 2018-01-09 19:52:46 It’s not really for VT to engage the DM in argument and VT is ignoring the DM by not buying their papers. I think any company is entitled to decide which papers it stocks and the reasons given by VT for not stocking the DM seem perfectly reasonable.

576 2018-01-09 19:50:15 Not buying - just sitting tight in the good positions already put in place during 2017. Agree with the euforia. Seems like most of the biotech and lots of oil related stocks are going crazy. Like a perfect storm ..
577 2018-01-09 19:49:13 Thought of the Day:

If the financial industry can believe #growth can be separated from the concept of #value, as in growth and value stocks, funds, ETFs, then truly there is no financial instrument that cannot be sold. 

Growth will always be a component of value. #Inertia
578 2018-01-09 19:48:53 Another big day- have to really appreciate the several months (or longer, who knows- fingers crossed) every several years where pot stocks give these historic opportunities for asymmetrical risk/reward trades. Take advantage. #TradeWithMoonshine

581 2018-01-09 19:47:03 Hi Douglas, any thoughts on when we likely reach the top here in stocks ?
582 2018-01-09 19:46:15 if it stocks one paper it should stock all papers not just the ones the left don’t like. This ‘values’ thing is bollocks.
583 2018-01-09 19:45:11 Unless you've made a ton of money in the stock market. How much do you have invested in stocks? Then again, the stock market rally isn't attributable to Trump either despite his claiming full responsibility.
584 2018-01-09 19:44:59 Haha! One of my pot stocks did the same. Announced it was considering employing blockchain and doubled its share price... kaching kaching kaching

588 2018-01-09 19:43:06 @tdichristopher The U.S. oil glut isn't going down; it's just being refined. Products stockpiles are growing at a faster rate than crude stocks are declining.
589 2018-01-09 19:43:01 Because we can’t possibly consider legislation to regulate assault rifles and bump stocks to help our police. That’d be insane..

601 2018-01-09 19:36:45 I actually disagree with Gross and others that the low is in. Think this is another "failed reflation" that's on the cusp of turning down. Similar to spring 2011 or mid-2014. See recent ECRI comments and trading patterns of (1) cyclical stocks like CAT and (2) TLT. I'm long ZROZ.

603 2018-01-09 19:36:11 Healthcare companies stocks have quadrupled under the ACA and they still receive billions in subsidies from the government while premiums skyrocket.
604 2018-01-09 19:35:28 Maybe.

As they only have limited stocks they could easily introduce people to their offers etc, have new regular readers as result.

607 2018-01-09 19:33:41 Almost everyone I know hates Trump. And, they still won’t give him any credit for the incredible stock market results since his election. Of course, if stocks were down 20%, they’d blame Trump.

650 2018-01-09 19:09:15 NOT a surprise to see some stocks to continue to go higher & keep making new highs until px unable to find fresh buyers to buy @ HIGH then have to auction down to attract & look for buyers & create VALUE !

Bump stocks was approved for sale to the general public in 2010 under the Obama Administration which for six yrs did nothing to change it.

753 2018-01-09 18:25:49 but the gains come from other people buying into the idea that the gains are going to come in.

801 2018-01-09 18:09:06 There were many stocks which went up by over 10x in a years time... Your speed was phenomenal in case of followers addition which went up by many xx's...this is the love people showered on you @porinju and hats off to thing like @Twitter...it's so small but very big.
802 2018-01-09 18:08:32 Stocks/investments  buy some bitcoin or ripple. Maybe a cheap shitty piece of real estate (not for living) and as time goes you can sell for profit!
803 2018-01-09 18:08:31 No doubt. I just started trading stocks. Not looking to get rich, just hoping to hedge some crypto gains as risk management. Planning on taking a small % of gains & throw them into the market.

808 2018-01-09 18:07:55 Thanks for the heads up. I will keep my eyes on this stock. I am not adding new stocks until after this month earnings report so if all is still well by February ill pick up a quick 2 shares #RobinhoodApp
809 2018-01-09 18:07:43 That happens I look at all the Pot stocks I sold back in early Dec. that ran shortly after I sold
810 2018-01-09 18:07:02 $IRBL needs to break 0.0005 to go ...then 0.001 is key break pt ... $DUTV started from this level ...so watching it closely

812 2018-01-09 18:06:20 The market will chase booming stocks as if they will rise to infinity. Problem is they never do. A strategy I use is when price hits a key slope on the parabola I exit. Typically when price breaks it's parabolic shape there comes a pretty heavy correction.
813 2018-01-09 18:06:02 Yes and Boeing investors should have sued Drumpf for his irresponsible tweet that made their stocks plummet.
814 2018-01-09 18:05:57 @sentimentrader Jason, today has negative NYSE stocks breadth with the S&P 500 up >25 bps. I would imagine that is an extraordinarily rare occurrence?
815 2018-01-09 18:05:44 Some peeps think stocks can't rise when bonds fall (interest rates rise). What about 1950-1964?
816 2018-01-09 18:05:31 Heard good things about @LuViva_ and their stocks are rising today. Keep up the good work. #GTHP #DetectCervicalCancerEarly

818 2018-01-09 18:05:05 $TSLA still in weak mode after big shoot up yesterday. sold weeklys bought in the morning with about 50% gain.  Biotech stocks are strong today.
819 2018-01-09 18:05:04 Small business optimism soared in 2017. U.S. Stocks hit fresh record highs. Credit card debt hit record highs for Americans in November.
820 2018-01-09 18:04:57 Well, to be fair, banning bump stocks wouldn't have prevented that shooting.
My biggest concern is that there are still no answers as to WHY he committed this attack. When we know more, we may be able to make some INTELLIGENT decisions, but not until then.
821 2018-01-09 18:04:41 Hullo!! Drumpf's irresponsible tweets made several stocks plummet. Boeing for instance. Look it up.

846 2018-01-09 17:55:23 There is creativity in EVERY profession, many people in the arts think they are the sole “creatives”, this is cery wrong. Valuing stocks, bonds and companies and making investment decisions is an art in and of itself, that investment banker is creative.
847 2018-01-09 17:55:03 It is fine if they actually invest with the idea of improving the company. But often, large companies with stocks will slash workers or wages and benefits. They value short term profit over long term investment. In the past it wasn't this way.

918 2018-01-09 17:27:31 Actually stocks tend to suck in higher inflationary enviroment. So even if you got an exporter paying PE30 is not that wise if you expect USD deval.  This market is on drugs, look at CAT - 100+ PE, 23 EV/EBITDA. Even with tax cuts and deval it is insane imho.
919 2018-01-09 17:27:25 Negative divergence between bank stocks and interest rates. $JPM was above $110.00 when the 10 yr was at 2.45%. Now with the 10 yr over 2.50%, JPMorgan Chase can't even get back to $110.00. Banks should be making higher highs with yields. Something to watch. #Bonds #InterestRates

934 2018-01-09 17:20:44 With all these students, what’s stopping you from having them all pumping a stock you front-run and sell off as it goes up? Don’t you have the potential to manipulate certain markets w/ these small cap & low float stocks?

1041 2018-01-09 16:46:08 There was heroic actions taken but unfortunately the @GOP aren't among them. Common sense things like banning bump stocks, cutting loopholes from background checks, etc. keep getting shot down by a party too spineless to stand up to the NRA. Cowards.
1042 2018-01-09 16:45:44 Looks like $GILD is one of the few stocks to own out of JPM.  Less than 8x price/earnings, 2.7% div. yield, launch Kite's CAR-T and call option activity at the $90 strike in size!
1043 2018-01-09 16:45:40 What have you done to help law enforcement?

1. Let the mentally ill buy guns
2. Let people purchase silencers 
3. Let gun stores continue to sell bump stocks

Good Job Cory ... Good Job.

1049 2018-01-09 16:44:00 This (printing money and simply buying stocks) combined with emergency levels of QE during stable economy from ECB and BoJ has unleashed inflation. The last two will be forced to taper. SNB will probably just keep printing and buying though.

1077 2018-01-09 16:34:08 Let me preface my comments by saying I LOATHE Trump. While he's nuts to think this means he's a great POTUS, his deregulation strategy and tax cuts have helped the market.  They hurt human beings, most of whom cannot afford stocks but do have an impact...unfortunately.

1081 2018-01-09 16:33:15 I think Option price often are not based on demand and supply like stocks. The base price is fixed based on volatility and spot price. Deviation is limited and demand and supply play limited role quickly balanced out. Unlimited supply is possible if demand exist.

1150 2018-01-09 16:13:18 Ok. Well allow me to rebut. I would like a rational discussion as well. I would suggest that bump stocks be placed on the class 3 list with full auto weapons.

1168 2018-01-09 16:08:07 #JMP18 Don’t show your biased. We know who you voted for. 
1) Stocks are where they are because the economy is growing at a rate faster than we seen in 10+ years. 
2) Companies & investors believe. Now they will put that cash to work.
3) Consolidation always happens.

1170 2018-01-09 16:07:35 And with #xrp rising so much everyone is after it.. Big guns dont wan ppl book profit. Its better to go with penny stocks
1171 2018-01-09 16:07:06 Stocks are def not for old people, I am just giving my advice. There is a reason I didn't invest early or at all. Scared money don't make money. I just hope you see the bubble before it pops. I have always told you my fear is their is no real equity.
1172 2018-01-09 16:07:00 Seeing some weakness start to appear in the weed stocks.  Seeing more slip red from green.
1173 2018-01-09 16:06:36 confusing stocks and flows
1174 2018-01-09 16:05:49 I personally think this is driven by retail investors and were still early in the bubble. I have no interest in Canadian MJ stocks tho.  Valuations could 3x from here, but you and I know thats a bad bet... New retail investors don't know that (people who enter a bubble late)...
1175 2018-01-09 16:05:38 DNAX look outs.
1176 2018-01-09 16:05:21 My watchlists are on fire recently. 12 out of 15 stocks on it did exactly what I looked for. Too bad I cant play them all. Played 3 of them $WTW $SLB $URBN 3/3 wins. Hard work really pays off! And I only play the higher float stocks. Very low risk and high potential profits!
1177 2018-01-09 16:04:16 First name anything trump has done. Stocks went up as people knew he'd look after big corps, you nation has not improved. Second as someone from outside the US I can confirm it's trump who is the global joke.
1178 2018-01-09 16:03:59 @billgunderson The pot stocks are more than people getting high. They will also be used medicinally. Wake Up to that! I also am not a user but see the great benefits ahead. I also don’t wear Victoria Secret but do own $LB.
1179 2018-01-09 16:03:42 how come they dont take breaks like pullback like other stocks?

1181 2018-01-09 16:03:28 @starbo06 The more I listen the more it sounds like you said fuck Trump! Not enough syllables to be Georgia. Be a bigger man, and more so, don’t let the Democrats poison your mind as they have done for way too long with minorities. Great things are happening, just look at stocks!
1182 2018-01-09 16:03:10 Bit of a dud so far :/ Notes in play? CEO pays himself far too much for not nearly enough to date. Merger better come through. Holding for now.
1183 2018-01-09 16:03:01 If you own $LG $SX $FAT or $IDK just hold onto your shares! All 4 just set new 52 week highs! No stock goes straight up, and you'll be kicking yourself for selling right before they blast off again. All 4 of these stocks still have MAJOR upside potential left.
1184 2018-01-09 16:02:59 Plenty of computer stocks went belly up. But that said nothing about the overall technology. You are a shallow thinker
1185 2018-01-09 16:02:46 These mega cap stocks ($300b+) can only move the needle so much with buybacks. You need outside money coming in.

1192 2018-01-09 16:01:07 @mystockedge Hi,  Started using your app. Thanks you so much for it. A small query.  Will '52W Breakout scan' tracks only a set (like cnx500) of stocks or they track all bse/nse stocks.  Bcoz I am unable to see some small caps which hit 52w high but not shown in track.
1193 2018-01-09 16:00:50 Yes and

1196 2018-01-09 15:59:44 @juicer2017 I’m good, I’m worrying too soon. All my other stocks have done so well. I hate to see it tank soon as I buy it. I’m hopeful

1198 2018-01-09 15:57:59 I agree. This is the early stages where in 2017 IPOs were big and now the financial industry is taking note.  Very similar to the Internet Boom in '99.  It was called "The New Economy" folks did not know how to price stocks since standard P/E Models were blown away.

Can you advise where I can buy it in the North of England/Yorkshire or thereabouts . Where I bought it from in Gateshead no long stocks Cheers
1204 2018-01-09 15:55:57 That applies to stocks, but I think more than 10% make money in crypto. “Almost” everything goes up in time in crypto.

1222 2018-01-09 15:48:59 Yeah, the market is up.  And who mostly benefits from any market upturn?  Those who own stocks, mostly.  And who are those people, mostly?  Relatively affluent, white folks like you.
1223 2018-01-09 15:48:57 If I was a legislator and wanted to honor law enforcement, I'd work on common-sense limitations on guns and gun ownership. Outlawing bump stocks and other trigger actuators would be my first move. No brainer, unless you're in the #NRA pocket.

1244 2018-01-09 15:38:40 50% of the people in the US don't even have stocks, so that doesn't really help them that the stock market is up. It's going up b/c of deregulation. That's never good.  We're headed for 08 all over again.

When reading these books and other TA info.. Try to understand how PRICE moves.. Stocks as an asset class tend to TREND (Up, Down or Sideways)

Don't bother wit indicators nd stuff.. Rem all indicators are a derivative of PRICE

1570 2018-01-09 13:52:51 Stocks are levered. Wages aren't directly

Better comparison is maybe free cash flow yield or asset yield.

Or wage productivity vs wages growth.

1598 2018-01-09 13:40:35 The utility stocks are primarily prized for their yields. As interest rates rise, such yields will be less attractive than just holding cash in a bank. Its just one variable though, and broadly the sector can still climb with rising rates, just less than what it might have.

1671 2018-01-09 13:00:21 Once the stock trader asked his investor, he also had to check with his investor. Imagine if this went on forever. Would the stock trader ever buy or sell his stocks or bonds? The answer is no.
1672 2018-01-09 13:00:14 Here's your answer -- infinite regress of causes. #Fail

Dude, imagine if a stock trader at the stock exchange was not able to buy or sell his stocks or bonds before asking permission from the investor.

1694 2018-01-09 12:44:40 Ok your perspective.  It's all relative.  In the short term I don't foresee much chance of a pps drop.  All stocks are risky and all otc stocks r very risky, but if they weren't we would be paying more per share.

1714 2018-01-09 12:30:22 You may earn real return of 6% on stocks vs 4% let's say on housing (net of carrying costs) longer term BUT you as a retail investor can't lever stocks but you can lever housing so $4 return on $25 equity minus 4% mortgage is 16% - 4% or 12% return on equity for your home
1715 2018-01-09 12:27:43 Housing is less liquid, more idiosyncratic and has direct carrying costs (insurance, repairs tax) unlike stocks.

But while the asset return may not be as good as stocks adjusted for those risks/carry the huge plus is the ability to lever cheaply (80% debt, 4% rate) unlike stocks

1936 2018-01-09 08:54:01 Liam you need to look at appreciation on a % basis. As an example, if a coin goes from $0.01 - $3.00 you will make a lot more than if a coin goes from $500 - $5000... It does not matter what the supply of the coin is in reality as long as it is finite. What matters is market cap.

2065 2018-01-09 06:55:17 You're a trump fan and you have no empathy for other people. Trumpsters are all self-centered & only care abt themselves. You also have no idea how people live when they're not lucky or when they're disabled or elderly & CAN'T work. BTW, this isn't the place to sell stocks.

2185 2018-01-09 05:06:44 Actually we democrats would very much like to see Trump succeed. Yes stocks are high but who owns stock? The wealthy, of course, not the majority who can barely make it from pay day to pay day. Also, not retirees. The 2% raise we got was eaten up by the increase in Medicare cost.
2186 2018-01-09 05:06:33 Yes, DP charges are at ~Rs. 15 per stock sold. All fees are flat, so the cost% decreases as the amount invested increases

For an average smallcase with 10 stocks/rebalanced quarterly over 5 years & Rs. 50,000 invested, cost% comes to 1%

2203 2018-01-09 04:56:11 I own stocks. I provide capital.  It's not weasel words. People aren't born owning things. They earn them. I bought equipment for my own small business and when I worked for others they bought the tools. And if I'm not paid for providing the tools, I'm not providing them. Simple

2211 2018-01-09 04:48:32 Just gonna say it.

2217 2018-01-09 04:42:19 Past records suggest too many stocks into Ban early into series tends to make short term tops. Very high OI is akin to overbought zone. You can check July 2016 Dec 2015. Even though none of these have an impact on index yet just a matter of alert not a confirmation
2218 2018-01-09 04:41:15 Probably because it's in the Amber zone for financial valuation. Mojo stocks should have green dots for all the parameters :-)

2227 2018-01-09 04:30:58 The CEOs affect stocks because of the power shifts not because of the CEOs dictating any significant inner workings of the company beyond delegation of the task to a department head etc.
2228 2018-01-09 04:30:46 All three... maxed out tfsa a while ago. Sold off dividend stocks in RRSP to buy. Maxed out RRSP while back, buy company stocks and putting in there.get big refund. No room left so had some money in cash account. Now looking to move to wifes tax sheltered accounts
2229 2018-01-09 04:29:59 Exactly my point. The stock market is not a measure of the economy. Jobs are based demand for goods and services. Bureau of labor and statistics shows we are at lowest level of job creation in 7 years! If you don’t have a job doesn’t matter how high stocks are.

2270 2018-01-09 04:05:27 1) good for you on your wise and disciplined investment approach. 2) more than half don’t invest in stocks 3) stocks aren’t a measure of economy, the economy is measured by demand for goods and services. Bur of Lab and Stats says we have a 7 year low in new jobs yet high stocks.

2310 2018-01-09 03:39:51 Vivek, is it necessary to own everything posted? (Or for that matter, even post everything that is owned ) 

One reason for posting more & owning less might differ is, u can not own everything (as u said). But if fewbody prefers ur view on larger universe of stocks, why not? 
2311 2018-01-09 03:39:42 No. Most of the stocks are owned by the richest like yourself. You all have benefited but jobs can only created by demand. BTW,  stock market rise less than under Obama.

2328 2018-01-09 03:30:17 MS on IT stocks: Growth expectations are low & soft indicators (Accenture results/mgmt commentary) point to a potential recovery in F19e.

2333 2018-01-09 03:28:23 I love the idea that if "stocks" go to zero your investment in anything other than mountain land and guns would be worth anything.

2341 2018-01-09 03:21:26 And it's more money for rich people.....20 percent of the population owns 80 percent of stocks So once again it's not something the average American is profiting from. But I keep forgetting you are only concerned with your fellow oligarchs.
2342 2018-01-09 03:21:22 Business creates jobs based on sales.  Not on stock price.  It can go the other way, stocks will rise as sales go up, but THIS market has been partially fueled by expectation of tax breaks.  Thst creates a bubble.  Bubbles break, then the market drops.

2348 2018-01-09 03:18:37 I'm talking about the type of hoarding that the top 1% do to own something like 60% of the wealth in the US.  Putting it in stocks or other investments are still hoarding.

2352 2018-01-09 03:15:48 I disagree. Go back and look at the liberal brainwashing and the fake news from Israeli media. It was a false flag created to form a narrative that was in trouble and it was created to get bump stocks out of the hands of civilians. It worked, too.

2461 2018-01-09 02:20:23 It's one of my favs. God's ways are not man's ways. Alone time with God is for our benefit. When we leave Him, it's like leaving relatives we visited in the country. They give us lots of stuff: fruits, vegetables, or fish if fishermen are in the family.

God stocks up our mind.

2535 2018-01-09 01:34:16 I am a “bricks and sticks” conservative investor.  I guess I am tainted morally with the whole idea of investing in weed but even if I try to think unbiased about weed stocks, at a minimum they are extremely speculative and volatile.  I will stick with “tried and true” blue chips
2536 2018-01-09 01:34:02 Maybe because some stocks (like some of mine) have gone to zero.

2594 2018-01-09 00:50:41 What is the best source you have for learning fibs? Do they work on the big boy stocks as much as they do on the small caps?
2595 2018-01-09 00:50:20 The Pump and Dump scheme on Tron is crazy.  Be careful out there, folks.   It's not regulated like stocks.....From .05-.20-.15 and dropping.
2596 2018-01-09 00:49:51 Hey do you know anything about penny stocks
2597 2018-01-09 00:49:19 Still trying to get my mind adjusted to credit, so in that case it’s the opposite of stocks

2602 2018-01-09 00:46:47 My issue is the volatility of the currency.   One minute, you’re a millionaire, and the next, you’re broke again.  Ultimately, it is still traded in US Dollars.   I think I’ll stick with the stocks I already have.   The future isn’t worth making the quick buck.
2603 2018-01-09 00:45:07 Stocks are my form of gambling.

2605 2018-01-09 00:44:07 As Cannabis Science stocks go up!!! CBIS
2606 2018-01-09 00:43:14 What’s your thought about markets in general. Stocks keep going higher housing is crazy, bonds keep selling off but somehow rebound right away  to me a lot of it seems Crazy. Say 2008 happens again do regualar markets got down 60-70% do crypto markets go down less or more.
2607 2018-01-09 00:41:40 Sadly, we still can't get over our neandethal instinct to run to the people who look and act like us the most when presented with a hardship.

It's not my fault I can't get a job because I'm a douche, it's the Honduran guy who stocks shelves at my local grocery store!
2608 2018-01-09 00:41:25 FUN FACT: H&M stocks are up today. 
You might not know that if you don't follow the market...but I'm here to tell you that they are! These companies know exactly what they're doing.

2613 2018-01-09 00:34:17 Pfizer has reacted to the $83B tax cut it received by buying back $1B in stocks, laying off workers, canceling R&D into Alzheimer's and Parkinson's medication and raising prices on 116 drugs. 

When does that trickle down start again?
2614 2018-01-09 00:33:47 Who owns the other 20% of stocks?  When they become more valuable who profits?

2630 2018-01-09 00:24:45 "For stocks to continue hitting new highs, they need to pull back first"                    

Everybody has an opinion

We follow the market, up since 9 March 2007

Forty years ago we heard old timers say they could not afford to sell and miss out

Now we know what they meant

2642 2018-01-09 00:19:38 The GOP genuinely couldn't care less. I bet most of them have stocks in defence companies and would make a nice profit. Why would they care if millions die in South East Asia? The war wouldn't come to US mainland, though Guam and Hawaii are vulnerable.
2643 2018-01-09 00:19:06 Every single president in recent history has watched stocks rise exponentially

2654 2018-01-09 00:10:47 Can someone teach me stocks. I’m trying to be a rich bachelor.
2655 2018-01-09 00:10:34 Thank you. Well, I can’t speak for the particular stocks you own, but the market in general wasn’t stagnant. It rose a staggering 67% from March 2009 until Jan 2010. And a total of +149% over his entire tenure. I’s say thats a bit more than stagnant.
2656 2018-01-09 00:10:12 Marijuana stocks?
2657 2018-01-09 00:08:13 Only 10% of Americans have stocks. And if you live in a state like NY, NJ, CA, MA then you will be paying more taxes. It's okay with you that teachers can't take a deduction? That college students can't take a deduction?
2658 2018-01-09 00:07:15 There are right wing talking points and then there FACTS. Stocks have been rising since 2009 and hit more robust highs than Trump. 

YES, Trump gets some credit for increased stock market confidence, but those were in response to deregulation and tax cuts.
2659 2018-01-09 00:06:58 What stocks are you watching for tomorrow?
2660 2018-01-09 00:06:21 I can’t afford stocks because I got laid off three weeks before Christmas and ever since November 27,2017, I haven’t been able to find work

2664 2018-01-09 00:05:15 @bbands do bbands work better in crypto compared to stocks, like more consistent returns using bbands as a trading signal? Maybe due to the inefficiency of how the crypto market handles information (EMH) and uninformed/inexperienced investors unable to use quant signals.
2665 2018-01-09 00:03:52 with $CANN and $NUU starting this week, they are going to be a lot of money moving into these stocks IMO.
2666 2018-01-09 00:03:02 That’s not the economy. That is corporate profits. You’ve yet to show one actual example of any changes GOP has done to spur economy. 80% of stocks are owned by 10% of people. Those gains don’t help the middle class.
