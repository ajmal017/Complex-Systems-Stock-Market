1 2018-10-09 23:58:39 Been hearing so much about the "housing stocks" being down lately..the Homebuilders ETF, XHB, and U.S. Home Construction, ITB have been down since late January..but have pretty much taken a nose-dive since mid-September -- And both are down more than 20% since late January
2 2018-10-09 23:58:05 Ross thinks his size of AUM makes him smart. He is a dime a dozen in bubbles. Born on 3rd thought he hit a triple and lives because he owns bubble stocks. Hitting middle class with fees . When the bubble ends he will still be rich but his 200k life savers will be devastated.

7 2018-10-09 23:56:07 Well take $FAZ for example, it is a 300% inverse of financials.  So if the bank stocks were to drop 10%, logically we could expect to see $FAZ jump up a bit less than 30%.  But because it's so leveraged its going to lose value very fast so its very risky, even to day trade.
8 2018-10-09 23:55:31 Nor can one expect LGBT people to recreate every "straight people  only" service - the demand isn't high enough. So what results? LGBT  individuals are systematically denied services because of "the free  market". Government intervention becomes needed. See: 1965 Civil Rights Act
9 2018-10-09 23:55:17 LGBT individuals only comprise ~5% of the population. San Francisco can support a gay neighborhood - most small towns cannot. You can't expect a "gay grocery store" to be financially sustainable, even if every gay person in town shops there.
10 2018-10-09 23:53:44 The Dow and S&P 500 has ended slightly lower as investors, worried about global growth prospects, fled from materials and industrials stocks but falling bond yields kept declines in check in the three major indexes.
11 2018-10-09 23:53:10 I need to read a book and do deep analysis on when to sell a stock. I have gotten lucky of late, and the stocks I have been buying jumped over a 2 week period. I always think in my head that the stocks will take a nosedive and I will be left with nothing.

38 2018-10-09 23:43:40 Lol. Didn’t he say the same thing years ago. Even gave predictions that turned out to be FALSE. Check his Net worth before and after he started the fear mongering..see a trend ? Invest in Green stocks then push agenda, reap rewards. Go Away Al you’re a fraud
39 2018-10-09 23:42:55 The dump will continue for many days. Flings will take time. Notes are getting converted at 0.0005 from old shell and hitting the market, that's why huge sell off today. The volume says huge toxic dumps hitting the market. Next stop 0.003-0.004. There is no bottom for such stocks
40 2018-10-09 23:42:40 I don't have much and I'm gonna keep it in cash for awhile. I will keep some dividend stocks for long-term.
41 2018-10-09 23:41:11 I make oatmeal in it just about every day. That, yogurt, and the barbecue chicken in the Melissa Smith book essentially are worth it to me. 

Oh, I make all kinds of stocks and sauces in it too.
42 2018-10-09 23:41:02 Many shares will be dumped soon
The company bought NNSR shell. The market maker then did their job to pump stock and now they are dumping shares. That's how these stocks plunge 
Look at volume, huge notes conversion happening
43 2018-10-09 23:39:15 I agree that we can't force people to like other people. However, we can ensure that citizens are treated equally in the public marketplace. A country should be able to secure its citizens equal treatment across public life. Don't want to serve someone? Operate out of your home.

53 2018-10-09 23:30:17 There's ALWAYS another trade. That kind of emotion is unhelpful, and speaks to a desire to be right or win.

Look at some old charts of stocks that went to zero. You won't find one EVER that did it from above the 200 SMA. Look at enron, lehman... they were all in the toilet first
54 2018-10-09 23:30:00 I’ve seen it. You are absolutely right. Same with stocks.

57 2018-10-09 23:26:58 Time to hop on some stocks
58 2018-10-09 23:26:34 We agree with most fund managers that the #DOW #stockmarket still has much of an upside well into 2019. So for #ASX investors why not take a sweep of stocks via an #ETF such as $VGS or $VTS or $NDQ
59 2018-10-09 23:24:21 There has been an ocean of red in the #ASX over the last few trading sessions. Some #stocks are so downtrodden that you wonder if one should #geton especially those with great #dividends and/or takeover targets such as $GXL and $MVF. We like this contrarian approach !
60 2018-10-09 23:23:49 The current run of yield had a retreat last night, with US 10yrs retreating, but not after toughing a new 7yr high of 3.27%. Tech stocks seemed to snap their losing streak however the S&P500 was down. @Snap was down 7% and is down 63% after @KylieJenner's tweet some months ago
61 2018-10-09 23:23:43 What are your thoughts about common sense gun laws? Nationwide background checks w/a waiting period, limit magazine capacity, ban bump stocks, ban domestic violence criminals from owning firearms--revoke their hunting privileges? Do you have any thoughts about the Brady bill?
62 2018-10-09 23:23:42 Literally watching one of your YouTube vids to find out more about how you trade momentum stocks and then I see your tweet about this blog post! 
63 2018-10-09 23:23:16 @chicagosean says, “As if stocks always only traded what they're “worth.” LOL :)”

I bot in and am already down 1.29%.
64 2018-10-09 23:22:02 OMG....yes, it is when a company buys back their own stocks.  It certainly doesn't grow the market at a record pace.  Lol

67 2018-10-09 23:21:35 Meanwhile, in reality, stocks are through the roof, wages are increasing, unemployment is hitting record lows and consumer confidence is back after 17 long years. Clinton, Bush and Obama were separate heads of the same dragon. Look up how Clinton policies pushed the house crisis.
68 2018-10-09 23:20:16 Start looking for stocks with high P/E's and wait to short them.  We are on the tipping point of going into bear market.  Imo

70 2018-10-09 23:18:54 I hate to say right because who really knows, but at this point, everything seems fairly normal. What's different are tech stocks lagging and int rates rising, which could be a big deal.
71 2018-10-09 23:17:37 an index can't be overweight stocks- it's an index. Active managers determine the weighting, and they ARE overweight FANG stocks.
72 2018-10-09 23:14:18 China's economy has been slowing for a while now.  Whatever agreement China and U.S.  agree on, it won't be good for China.  I will be shorting heavily on Chinese stocks when it rally's .

81 2018-10-09 23:04:33 Hey Einhorn, We got the tips to get you out of this hole.  We tip more stocks then any other UK magazine.  Sometimes 40 or even 50 a week.  Get on board pal only @chronicInvest can save your ass now.  What have you got to lose?  Sub is £300 a year.
82 2018-10-09 23:03:45 By definition, most stocks are 1 S.D. from their mean price. With higher volatility stocks like small caps, 1 S.D. could easily be the amount off the all time high shown. So great chart but without context I don't know what it means.
83 2018-10-09 23:02:45 GREAT ONE YOU ARE GETTING THE WORD OUT AND THANKS FOR THE SUPPORT AND BUY MARIJUANA STOCKS
84 2018-10-09 23:02:26 SNB holds only 90 billion dollars in US stocks
85 2018-10-09 23:01:36 Almost all stocks are almost always below their all-time highs, unless they make fresh highs each day; none do. Given average volatility how much should an average stock be below its all-time high on any given day? I don't have the math to do the simulation. But I am guessing 1/2
86 2018-10-09 23:01:19 Cmon man - I’m ridiculously inexperienced when it comes to trading.... That said, it’s easy to see that with a mass following it could be easy to manipulate numbers / the market - especially in relation to smaller stocks. Mix in some co conspirers to extend your reach and BAM 
87 2018-10-09 23:01:00 Like stocks itself or stock options as well ?

90 2018-10-09 22:59:01 Am super grateful to live walking distance to an organic health food store that stocks things like marshmallow root at a reasonable price so my sick ass can go buy it for tea.

Incidentally, by sip two of marshmallow root tea with a bit of honey, feeling significantly less pain.

95 2018-10-09 22:56:08 1) The global investable universe of stocks has doubled since the 90s. 
2) The majority of those IPOs in the 90s were for <100 mil; large IPOs have been stable
3) Is it really prudent to allow individual investors into venture type deals? They aren't getting Sequoia dealflow...

98 2018-10-09 22:55:33 Was so cool to already have a position in $AGRX before it exploded upward today. Have enjoyed trading stocks, cryptocurrency and forex the past two days plus winning that $500 on the Cash 3 yesterday. Even got some naps in. Off from hospital job till Thursday.
99 2018-10-09 22:55:05 And another app is Stash. Stash allows you to invest in ETFs. ETFs leg you buy pieces of stocks rather than the whole thing. So a ETF that deals with technology can let me own a piece of a stock in Facebook Google Twitter...etc. all in one. To make it simpler
100 2018-10-09 22:53:17 Stocks showing upward momentum on the daily charts:
$WYY, $ZNGA, $XXII, $PPDF, $GEVO.
101 2018-10-09 22:52:40 Use Robinhood. It’s a good investing app for millennials. And when it comes to picking what to invest in just keep an eye on the news. For example, stocks in cannibas are booming right now.
102 2018-10-09 22:52:37 Shouldn't it be "profit always wins" when comparing stocks?
103 2018-10-09 22:51:02 If you’re ever unsure to sell or want to wait and the item doubles sell half and always get back your original investment that way at the very least you break even and never taking a loss, the market isn’t crazy volatile like say stocks, forex etc but capital preservation is key
104 2018-10-09 22:50:09 Financial tips:
1. Get training and acquire a good job/business
2. Be frugal with your spending
3. Save much more than you spend
4. Pay off debts before you invest
5. Invest is what you know (don’t invest in stocks if you don’t understand stocks)
6. Enjoy 
105 2018-10-09 22:49:32 1000 is still way generous than 500. Yes someone indeed came up with that number based on some stock patterns and he by the way claimed, he knows way more than anyone else  when it comes to stock and he is really good at historical charts and global events. Huh - Stocks!
106 2018-10-09 22:48:49 I prefer to use a log scale for stocks indices and prices as they provide a better reflection of investor participation
107 2018-10-09 22:46:51 cause they all have stocks in the companies making the weapons.

113 2018-10-09 22:43:42 It’s not just Ford. All the automobile stocks are dropping. Trump’s tariffs are causing much long term damage to some of our oldest companies. A man that declared bankruptcy six times doesn’t have a clue how to conduct business decisions. His brand is all based on lies.

That by itself is shady!

122 2018-10-09 22:36:36 The only way we will be able to confirm is retroactively by her financial disclosures. At the end of four years is she a millionaire?

127 2018-10-09 22:34:51 you’re actually arguing the benefits of trickle down economics. It doesn’t work it, it never worked. When corporations get tax breaks they don’t invest in the workers they buy their own stocks artificially inflating the cost giving big pay outs to the stock holders.
128 2018-10-09 22:34:40 @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @GOP  well, stocks are almost back to level they were at January 1, 2018., meaning down yet AGAIN today. ...so much winning....    please let November  get here before the reprehensibles have permanently ruined america for 98% of America.

293 2018-10-09 20:30:30 It’s interesting how Trump and most who want to see the markets continue running higher believe we should slow down hiking. There is a case to be made that the only reason stocks can continue higher at these valuations, is a result of the fed continuing to raise..

313 2018-10-09 20:15:20 Agree but the thing is those issues have been there for over decades. Almost all the governments have managed to keep the country afloat despite of those.

376 2018-10-09 19:48:13 4d) By investing the OVERWHELMING majority of funds in luxury condos, malls, hunting resorts, stocks, etc. (while ALSO teaching impoverished members to give tithing even if they can't afford food for their children), LDS church sends a very clear message, & not a good one.

378 2018-10-09 19:46:39 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to treat your insomnia
379 2018-10-09 19:45:48 I agree.  I think the @federalreserve with @benbernanke chose existing asset holders (housing, stocks,...) over the future holders.  They stole future growth for the sake of avoiding negative growth in the present.  Typical govt. operation, picking who wins and who loses.

418 2018-10-09 19:22:39 If any one thing keeps me up about the markets, it's that intermediate bond yields are above the SPY since September. The divvy-stock tailwind could be ending and econ growth peaking. #whyriskitall #chasingyield #stocks #money

437 2018-10-09 19:10:30 "on sale" . In the 1970s stocks were on sale for most of the decade, and an inflation adjusted balanced portfolio lost 60% of its purchasing power.
I will consider stocks to be on sale when the Dow hits the lower bound of its 100 year trend channel.

439 2018-10-09 19:09:31 @sarge986 Cramer seems to be very worried that the “growth” period is over. He’s talking caution. Is this a time to have more cash than stocks on hand? Invest in value, large dividends? Are you worried too?
440 2018-10-09 19:09:11 Good point. My friend wanted to "invest" in tech stocks now, and he invested in bitcoin end of December. I consider it a good indicator
441 2018-10-09 19:08:44 Same. Maybe we need to add more apps into the fold and really keep the stocks guessing? Really show these stocks who’s boss.

Post-close update while doing my daily market work. Stocks down enough to kick the TREND INTO DOWN, FULL HEDGES IN PLACE. Time to be cautious keep the risk in the portfolio down and enjoy the ride!
546 2018-10-09 18:12:01 Mortgage Bonds are near unchanged while Stocks are modestly lower. Begin the day floating, but be on guard for any sudden reversal lower.
547 2018-10-09 18:11:37 Avoiding pumpers is preferable but sometimes the underlying stocks might actually be worth a second look, thus why its vital everyone does their own DD.
548 2018-10-09 18:10:46 And yet more jobs are created still every day because BUSINESSES ARE EXPANDING. More expansion, more money, more job growth. Even if they buy their stocks back, it leads to growth and growth requires employees.

606 2018-10-09 17:44:36 Very true! Make sure you rebalance your socialmedia and tech weighting in your portfolio, ask the question if you want to have any tech stocks (growth stocks) for the next bear market. And, check your direct and indirect emerging market exposure in your global portfolio! #FAANG

I respectfully disagree.

669 2018-10-09 17:20:30 If things start to turn do you favor stocks that had a deeper pullback (and may have a stronger bounce opportunity) or ones that didn't pull back much.

726 2018-10-09 16:59:06 Here's the deal, Rick Scott got an A+ from the NRA, and then voted to take away bump stocks. When does the NRA plan to be PROactive, instead of reactive? Why is an SBR still NFA? Why no HPA? This is why I let my membership lapse.

733 2018-10-09 16:57:15 For low priced stocks like AMD, I buy high delta options so my stop is similar to Stewie's. For higher priced, like AAPL, I buy at least 50% delta options and my stop is 50% of my entry. When the trade is working, I start scaling out and never let remaining portion go red
734 2018-10-09 16:56:51 PORTFOLIO down 0.7% today - it's pretty rubbish but I've seen rubbisher. A few chunky drops on already good value Stocks but it's that sort of Market mood. Top honours to #TEP up 8.5% :-)
735 2018-10-09 16:56:33 I tend to lean bearish on the markets but I really feel like a down 3-5% day is in store soon. Stocks can’t handle shrinking margins, disappointing earnings, and rising rates. 

Maybe I’m really wrong though, that would explain why I’m having a bad year in p&l.
736 2018-10-09 16:56:19 Does this explain why "only 30 stocks" of the DJIA seem to have the same overall performance of the S&P500?

1011 2018-10-09 15:02:07 How could Trump NOT be encouraged in this by the market. Indices near all-time highs despite ramping up the tariff plans. Everyone tells me "stocks are forward-looking", but we've made the protectionism/tariff mistake in the past. Eh well, no one demands rationality ALL the time.
1012 2018-10-09 15:02:03 I hope so; I have a ton of stocks. And don't get me wrong: thanks for speaking out. I'm a 40-year chartist--100% technical-- myself. (But I want to understand the thinking, too.)

That said, "deflationary bust" seems only sure thing (logical thing) on the horizon.
1013 2018-10-09 15:01:52 If we women know the difference between a home equity loan vs. a home equity line of credit, stocks vs. bonds, an adjustable rate mortgage vs. a fixed rate mortgage, we will be so much more powerful to interact with the world. #babyboomerwomen #womenandmoney
1014 2018-10-09 15:01:15 I pity people who entered Japanese market in 1989 . Now if someone bought Indian cement stocks in 1992 or tech  in 2000 .or infra / real estate  in 2008 . They will say bear market lasted for lifetime . It is important to understand most people invest in Fad sector @ peak value

1016 2018-10-09 15:00:55 But again, going off on a tangent that has nothing to do with the NRA and the ban of bump stocks. You should be applauding the NRA since it is backing this legislation. But you just keep deflecting.

1023 2018-10-09 15:00:04 marijuana may only be exported if it is for medical or scientific purposes under the new legislation so why is the CBC repeatedly talking about the global market - ? It just pumps up enthusiasm for stocks and is wrong-headed.

1025 2018-10-09 14:59:22 That’s a valid point. Stocks are based on a company’s financials and stabilization to grow. But nervous investors can also make it drop and mere speculation by them affects stocks as well. At least you gave valid argument and didn’t just spout off a stupid comment so thank you.

1043 2018-10-09 14:52:42 His data includes bank holdings and is a more complete aggregate measure of actual allocations (based on FED data).  This likely dilutes the measure and makes his allocations to stocks lower.  Mine is just from the simplistic AAII survey.
1044 2018-10-09 14:52:38 Is this possibly because he has invested in stocks? Bonds? Maybe earning interest on high amounts of savings? Help from family? Where is your proof of this claim? Kind of ignorant to claim something like this without evidence. I’ll start calling you Dr. Ford.

Cannabis related stocks are the latest pump and dump rage. PYX is a small cap, low float cannabis play. An unknown executive left Dr Pepper and took an EVP job, probably for a large options package.  Question: you consider this research?

1069 2018-10-09 14:41:18 @TDellerCBC  Importation and exportation of marijuana, however, can be authorized for medical or scientific purposes only, The CBC is over reporting on the future global market - it is illegal under the new legislation to export - and this false narrative is pumping up stocks

1074 2018-10-09 14:38:46 @adriearsenault why is The National covering exportation of pot and the global pot economy when the new legislation does not allow exporting and no other country is legal - it is a false narrative that is pumping up the stocks - wrong

1077 2018-10-09 14:37:31 What's a good way to invest in stocks
1078 2018-10-09 14:37:17 Eh. I can’t argue China hasn’t been manipulating prices, that’s a valid point. An escalating trade war isn’t necessarily protectionist as much as enriching himself since some American companies have benefitted. Others have died, but he probably ditched those stocks first.

This is not enlightening to me at all.  If you don't DYODD you will get burned, most know this.  I have no time for pure doom and gloom.
1083 2018-10-09 14:35:50 The reset won't happen in one day. There is several things that have to happen first. It might start on the 10th of Oct or the 11th of November. I think it's already started but a massive sell off of bonds and stocks will come first. We will need a major crisis first.
1084 2018-10-09 14:35:47 I predict, without reservation, that come 2021, when Trump is the "former President" there will be a large number of new authors, who were his former employees.  Buy publishing stocks now.

1087 2018-10-09 14:35:07 It's evident that the bond market is entering a bear market. The dollar continues to be sold while stocks are bid up. Investors have clearly chosen stocks over the USD, but what they should be choosing is gold over stocks & bonds. 1/2

1128 2018-10-09 14:23:41 Can only agree with what Petri said Ria. Don't panic - these things can & will happen with lightly traded stocks. A couple of days prior SYG traded as low as R7.00. I think the R1.00 must've been a fat finger.
1129 2018-10-09 14:23:15 $USDCHF clings to daily gains near mid-0.99s as DXY stays above 96.  US stocks trade mixed during early trade, #Nasdaq outperforms.
1130 2018-10-09 14:22:31 Maybe accumulating DoD stocks on the cheap. His administration is going completely fucking sideways with Mueller up his ass, historically we start another war for distraction when shit gets like this. The tail wagging the dog.

Hopefully you’re right.
1131 2018-10-09 14:22:18 How do you distinguish. Please share. People who bought this dip even in the best stocks last 2 weeks have lost. Thanks. Btw, I have no positions
1132 2018-10-09 14:21:31 The most recent stocks I bought are looking quiet. Tryna think if I should let em ride in hopes they probably pick up and bring me gains or if I should just cut my losses before they get worse

1154 2018-10-09 14:14:12 If you only hold total market indexes, you’re taking more risk than is necessary.

2000-2009 “Lost Decade”

70% US Market Index, 30% Total Int’l Index = +0.6%

65% Global Large & Small Value Stocks, 35% Five-Year Bonds = +6.5%
1155 2018-10-09 14:13:47 The stock market crash yesterday finds its roots in the stock market crash of 2005 when the investors lost over 7 billion in stock price. PM Aziz and his coterie of thief’s earned billions by shorting stocks 48 hours ahead of the crash. Naizi this crash is going to haunt you.
1156 2018-10-09 14:13:41 I’ve seen time and time again that I do waaaay better with stocks above $10, most likely because they have more liquidity. I tried trading $AGRX but having to size big to make any profit is not my cup of tea. So, lost -$215 there.
1157 2018-10-09 14:13:00 If you only hold total market indexes, you’re taking more risk than is necessary.

Since 8/1996:

70% US Market Index, 30% Total Int’l Index = +7.8%; SD: 15.1

65% Global Large & Small Value Stocks, 35% Five-Year Bonds = +8.1%; SD: 10.7

When stocks fall, the conventional wisdom is that safe haven gold would rise, and vice versa. But when stocks fall because of rising bond yields, it is a different story.

1198 2018-10-09 13:57:42 with US auto stocks down sharply recently (GM, F, FCAU) and none with much solvency risk in my view, i think this may be factored in. Mr Kass's view may be consensus by now...and i think the stocks may have bottomed. just a view - i am never in doubt, but always wrong...

1214 2018-10-09 13:54:05 A little bit of honesty here from these guys wouldn’t go amiss. As in, sorry, we just picked the wrong stocks. Most non systematic hedge funds claim that they don’t track a benchmark and invest in a concentrated high conviction portfolio.
1215 2018-10-09 13:53:32 That makes more sense. I wonder if instead of avoiding "dirty" stocks, it makes more sense to think about what companies are going to do well in  a world trying to save itself.

1369 2018-10-09 12:51:38 Sure, why not. The 1% just got a cash grab they used to buy back stocks. Let’s cut everything now even thought the GOP has intentionally weakened health care and any other social safety net they can get to. But hey, CEOs got new gilded yachts so it’s a win!

1482 2018-10-09 12:05:29 Good call Keith. There's been a confluence of important issues that have been completely ignored as stocks have pushed higher and higher, from nose-bleed Tech valuations to way overvalued Industrials to slowing China/global growth. Look at $PPG this morning -9% -ouch.

1488 2018-10-09 12:01:48 In January / February 2018, $SPY $IWM EPS expectations were improving as markets sold off. There was unjustified fear after the Atlanta Fed issued a hot 1Q18 GDP forecast. The inflation / rising interest rate fears were unwarranted & this is why stocks are up +10% since 2/8.

Cnbctv18 gives commentary on host of issues.. Like wise why don't you bring in data of frantic selling, source of such selling to viewers.  Front line stocks crashing 5-15% in couple of minutes.. While co's spend ages build business
1500 2018-10-09 11:58:36 I see..I do not follow charts. Few more corrections and its value for money.remember even with corrections FMCG stocks would still be richly valued & that's because the business has certainty to it. So a good stock for people who want to hold for 5-10 years,like I do :-)

1502 2018-10-09 11:57:17 To be fair, I didn’t even know these colours were a thing this tweet and I’ve been looking at them stocks for years.
1503 2018-10-09 11:56:50 Indeed. Acc 2 me d only real reason fr d big mkt fall is coz it rose too much as well (atleast individual stocks did) - valuations hv bn tremendously high for whole host of FMCG pack & mny others as well. Before tht kachra stocks 2 went wild. Things hd 2 cm bck 2 ground in time

$ is 74.40 grab it till stocks last.Even Honor8x gonna be costlier than this.
1506 2018-10-09 11:55:40 FMCG is also overpriced. Stocks have given more return than earnings growth. PE re rating cannot contribute forever. Now stock price should lag earnings growth.

1510 2018-10-09 11:53:38 Lol yea right.  Stocks spike up when Trump is elected and then spike again when Trump signs executive orders removing everything Obama ever did.  Markets like Trump, NOT Obama lol

1518 2018-10-09 11:50:49 I called this coming. Regan gave the rich a tax break then raised it 7 times. Does anyone remember 18-21% interest rates? Buy bank stocks in 6 months. National debt will be over $1 trillion shortly if not now.

1520 2018-10-09 11:50:44 Also, yes someone is always holding, but if I had to guess, the # of people owning stocks decreases in crashes, so the average equity allocation % drops.  My prior is that its whales like (Buffett, Soros, etc.) that buy up stocks in downturns.

1546 2018-10-09 11:30:38 Not me stating this but if rates go higher, the fear in the markets will always be that institutional money will move from stocks to bonds.  Common thesis. As rates go higher, more money gets invested in them. Money has to come from somewhere (whether it be cash or equities)

1614 2018-10-09 10:47:21 Hi Mohit! The goal of rebalancing is to ensure the constituents of the smallcase remain true to the theme. While our proprietary filters identify stocks with long-term potential, they are still impacted by the volatility in the markets.
1615 2018-10-09 10:47:18 Crazy how fast people turn on stocks

1617 2018-10-09 10:46:41 I dunno about you, but I can't  remember a time when a province had scrum half stocks including Ireland's third/fourth choice, a decent Kiwi, a struggling 3rd choice and not one, but TWO academy scrum halves. Plethora of riches
1618 2018-10-09 10:46:27 IT stocks are witnessing consolidation after the recent surge. We suggest keeping close eye on TCS results, which is schedule on October 11.
1619 2018-10-09 10:45:11 We advise keeping stop loss at 98 in Ashokley,220 in Mothersumi and 57 in PNB. Avoid averaging these stocks and use bounce to reduce positions.
1620 2018-10-09 10:45:09 these falls shows that the traders are selling the stocks which are near the year high and that too with heavy volume
1621 2018-10-09 10:44:56 Yes, I was reading in fish farmer magazine about how they are going to try AGAIN to farm cod.  If they would manage the wild stocks carefully they we wouldn't have to go down the farming route with all of the issues that it brings.

1649 2018-10-09 10:32:53 It is quite remarkable the divergence between global stock markets in the last 12 months. Japanese & US stocks doing well. Chinese and European struggling. We are bottom up investors, however we are starting to see more value in Europe and Asia.

1738 2018-10-09 09:42:44 I was making a comment about calling bottoms on stocks, not whether an entity can buy the whole company. I agree with you. I actually believe it is highly possible Tesla will be acquired whole by another auto OEM. At $50-$100 per share.
1739 2018-10-09 09:42:23 The next big fall would be in High PE stocks

1750 2018-10-09 09:28:32 After targets hit, dividends paid, stocks often decline. Think risk. Target hit, done and dusted. New period begins, new targets, new risk assessment. BAT, a conglomerate, is capitalized at less than $80 Bill. Movements of 10, even 20 not that unusual.

1. A large portion of stocks under their 200-DMA. Their trajectory has been consolidation-downward levels only
2. Naspers has been ''lacklustre', not trading it usual 50-80 rand variance

It depends on valuation but just now I don't like cars,insurance and I am keen on BASF,DTE. DAX is in the middle of the final sell-off: it depends on US- and Italy bonds, but still pressure

1776 2018-10-09 09:09:04 For this reversal, do you normally make a trade of it or is it more so for support for stocks benefiting from it? If it is a trade, do you buy once it goes over the first poke bar as mentioned on the post you shared explaining the 2B reversal or wait for other confirmation?

Hopefully by that time you'll be able to trade XRP for other things like stocks, bonds,  and gold such that you won't even have to cash out the remaining. But it would be wise to diversify then. Of course, you can leave 10-20% in cryptos.

1806 2018-10-09 08:38:10 Look at the root cause . Why have stocks run out from wholesalers and manufacturers . 
How are wholesalers going to fund their imports when you have separated accounts . 
How is a company  that imports going to generate forex to meet future payments .

1809 2018-10-09 08:36:50 Stocks are down cuz of Govt's tough measures on Tax system. If for instance they introduce that amnesty scheme of converting black money white then stocks would rocket like they did in past. Hold tight and u will see same stocks will break all records of past under this Govt.
1810 2018-10-09 08:36:37 The key to  investing is conviction. You often see analysts recommending stocks but you don't see them acting on their own recommendation.

1849 2018-10-09 08:08:37 I don't hold any either, but still get their infos from back in the days. According to those, holders can either sell at a fixed price or convert to stocks in a Lichtenstein company. Haven't heard of any problems with that yet, but there still seem to be details to work out.

1995 2018-10-09 06:21:00 After researching for a couple minutes, approximately 53 million stocks that are considered “bump stocks” (not a real term) have been sold in the USA. Las Vegas was the only instance they were used to harm people. If you got offended by a statement that’s a personal problem.

2001 2018-10-09 06:17:46 I’m just stating my opinion. I never mentioned Las Vegas and I have experience with bumpfire stocks. The tragedy that ensued in Vegas was horrible. My statement had nothing to do with it. Ban them or not, I don’t care. They aren’t practical in a real world situation.

2029 2018-10-09 05:59:19 Recent broad weakness in markets is a hard reminder to set and hit your stops. Better to wait until stocks find support that is tested before an entry. A combination of big money exiting and short selling will likely create an oversold scenario, usually with scary headlines.

2175 2018-10-09 03:47:32 The thing about bubbles is eventually they burst. If you’re tracking most financial advisors like warren buffet, they are starting to load up on bonds rather than stocks, anticipating a hike in the prime rate. With a hike in interest rates, stock prices will fall.

2214 2018-10-09 03:14:30 Suicide , broken bottle of whiskey thrown at the wall and everything thing on the desk pushed away from anger and frustration I guess has to do with something on the chart which shows stocks were on the decline..
2215 2018-10-09 03:14:24 Accumulating only top stocks above 200-SMA in small parts is the way out when bears are at work. Predicting bottoms and tops is not winning line of thinking in markets. As such there is no need for this exercise.

2218 2018-10-09 03:13:56 @CNBCTV18Live please never forget this morning tips about stocks. It is very helpful to us ( retailers ) . Thanks once again for your valuable analysis.

2219 2018-10-09 03:13:12 Today Hot Stocks: Coal India, Tata Motors, NBCC, Britannia Industries, Sadbhav Infra.
2220 2018-10-09 03:13:03 I received three different emails from the sell side saying rates will matter for stocks when 10yr is at 3.5%, 4% or 5%. Takeaway: no one has any idea what’s going on.
2221 2018-10-09 03:12:21 Yes fully. I'll being studying RSI on a technical level further after this exchange of messages to grasp a better understanding. Moreover, if I can point you in the direction of @ToneVays who is a seasoned investor/trader of stocks, he will disagree with the RSI argument.
2222 2018-10-09 03:11:57 @Schmidt_MBA I’m hoping Emerging Markets turnaround soon. Tech stocks are starting to look appealing $FDN in correction territory -10%
2223 2018-10-09 03:11:49 Rapping really ain’t the money maker, owning shit is. Property, businesses, labels, stocks.

2225 2018-10-09 03:08:12 No offense, I understand profit is profit but to put up $25,000 just to make $355 wouldn't exactly exceed my expectations but thats just me & youre right they wonder why we trade OTC stocks I trade Big Boards as well but c'mon headlines for a 1% move, I guess I think differently.
2226 2018-10-09 03:08:07 Drawing your attention towards the hell like situation in Laxmi Nagar!! There are large stocks of garbage collected here at every 50 mtrs.this is over a month time now.

2227 2018-10-09 03:07:52 stock market! is bleeding plunging to two year low! instability politically & indecision is hurting stocks!!!
2228 2018-10-09 03:07:16 The only reason the stock market is climbing so fast is because of stock buybacks. The corporations used the tax cuts to snatch all their stocks back and make their special shareholders richer. A high stock market really has fuck all to do with most of Americans.
2229 2018-10-09 03:07:01 All over social media:
Why did financial stocks fall- liquidity, inr, crude.
Why did energy, textiles, sugar, auto, infra, capital goods, psu bank, consumption etc stocks fall? Liquidity, inr, crude.
What is mkt view? ST: liquidity, inr, crude. LT: liquidity, inr, crude.

2246 2018-10-09 02:48:16 You playing stocks ah
2247 2018-10-09 02:46:49 You want to think of it this way, about 30% of the US's grid power demand is keeping server rooms cool, and the majority of data is with high volume trading and investment groups monitoring the stocks down to the millisecond.

Only longs have been very wrong, alas, facts are not the forte of tesla bulls.
2249 2018-10-09 02:45:44 Sure! We all agreed that bump stocks should be illegal. So what happened to making it that way?

2258 2018-10-09 02:42:25 Its amazing that like credit agencies, most broking houses report lower targets for stocks/mkts only after stocks/mkts have reached the same. 
Reminds me of the broken clock that states time right 2 times in a day.

2265 2018-10-09 02:37:03 Even a layman of economics knows what is happening in the country.  Lack of our own domestic currency has killed the country.  We need to build enough gold stocks to back our Zim$.  There is too politics  in US$ exacerbated by sanctions.
2266 2018-10-09 02:35:23 Not sure if that’s more of a bearish outlook on tech stocks than a bullish one on housing. With rates only headed up and property tax deduction capped, unclear how far up housing can go.

2341 2018-10-09 01:32:19 Everyone in the know, is acutely aware that we have crossed the threshold when global warming could have been stopped. That was back in the 70's & 80's. It is time that we start planning the next stage which is protecting our food stocks and our existence.
2342 2018-10-09 01:30:55 Would you count a S&P 500 ETF and a NASDAQ ETF as diverse enough? Sometimes I'm not sure what diverse means... Different companies ok, but if I buy only tech stocks seems not very diverse. The rest I have to say I don't have enough knowledge to judge..

Pick stocks like you are building a portfolio for your retired parents. 

Stocks which are steady slow compounders & won't have permanent loss of capital. 

Leave the multi baggers to the 90% who will never make money in markets.

2350 2018-10-09 01:26:52 It's easy for us to tout how well an economy is or isn't doing because our incomes aren't being affected. On the other hand, bragging about the stock market booming when over half of America doesn't own them is crazy. The average American is making less and don't own stocks.

2359 2018-10-09 01:18:16 It's NOT about the stock that goes up most quickly. It's about the stock that goes up CONSISTENTLY and SMOOTHLY (i.e. high sharpe ratio due to low volatility). Looking at a weekly chart helps a lot to visually identify those stocks.

2399 2018-10-09 00:49:04 OK, you‘re assuming the growth will sustain into 2019, but growth stocks are selling. Markets should start to price a mild recession about 6 months in advance.
