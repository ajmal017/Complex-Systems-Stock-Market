2 2018-11-21 23:59:42 But I’m sure you’d inflame the stock market with tweets of cheap oil
3 2018-11-21 23:59:36 We don't want Saudi oil! Do the Right Thing & sanction the crown prince.
4 2018-11-21 23:59:36 We should cut Saudi out of the picture and run oil to $100 ...trump don't be a bitch. Need oil higher. I need a new #Porsche @TulsiGabbard
5 2018-11-21 23:59:36 America first means cheaper oil for us peasants. You may not value that though.
6 2018-11-21 23:59:29 Oil dropped due to tarriffs.  Econ slodown predicted for next 2yr. U praise tyrants & attack heros & allies.  Now the judicial branch is calling out your lies.  You let the Saudis walk all over you when you had the upper hand.  15 billion of sales under Obama, none yet under you.
7 2018-11-21 23:59:26 From #SaudiArabia : Rami al-Naimi, son of former oil minister Ali al-Naimi, was given electric shocks and waterboarded. ex Finance Minister Adel Fakieh, who remains in prison, was also physically abused while at Ritz, according to people familiar.

9 2018-11-21 23:59:15 Why do you believe the word of a murderer instead of your own intelligence agency that is trying to protect our country? OR ARE YOU TRYING TO BECOME A DICTATER? WE CAN TAKE THERE OIL WE DONT HAVE TO BUY IT.
10 2018-11-21 23:59:15 So the price of one life is less than all the oil in Saudi Arabia?  Learn to negotiate with lesson in humanity, not riches. Although they respect strength,  they also respect honesty, so teach the Prince to do better, and not comply to his lies. America first is a fools errand.
11 2018-11-21 23:59:15 Haven't you heard, oil is cheap for the moment so it's all good/
12 2018-11-21 23:59:10 A President who values oil over human life betrays us.

14 2018-11-21 23:59:03 Lower oil prices? Ours are up over a dollar since trump took office.
15 2018-11-21 23:59:01 More diplomacy must occur to stop the blockade. Saudis will not allow Iran to exercise their power over this situation. Why can't face to face meetings broker a deal? Saudi Arabia is powerful in terms of oil supply to the world--what is the key piece to getting them to allow food

17 2018-11-21 23:59:00 My 8 year old takes cannabis oil. He's NEVER been as high on cbd as he's been on pharmaceutical meds. It's a serious game changer for neuro disorders. Georgia needs an ice cream parlor like this
18 2018-11-21 23:58:58 Who do they have to kill to offset oil prices?
19 2018-11-21 23:58:57 Andrew, you sent me a budget E Mail as a constituent. You said there was more backing for the Oil and Gas Industry. I replied asking for details as I had missed this Mr Withey said he would get back to me as he did not know them. Still waiting.

40 2018-11-21 23:58:53 I thought we were self sufficient in the oil department? Also, is SA the only other oil producer in the world? Nope. There is this little group called OPEC that decides about supply etc. How come you are only worshipping SA?
41 2018-11-21 23:58:45 They're low because the UNITED STATES is pumping more OIL than...the Saudis!!!

And because the economy is slowing, and demand is DOWN!!!
42 2018-11-21 23:58:32 If you don't make sustainable palm oil more profitable than unsustainable palm oil, you only encourage people to continue destroying habitats for unsustainable palm oil as it's cheaper to grow. So you're contributing to habitat loss by doing this.
43 2018-11-21 23:58:29 I don’t think anyone really thinks they’re good. I just don’t want to lose my job as a result of the economic decline that would result from sanctioning them and what that would do the price of oil. I assume it’s the same for most though maybe they don’t want to admit that.
44 2018-11-21 23:58:17 Girl I swear!!! That’s why I keep coconut oil on it to help w the elasticity of my belly. I already KNOW that’s what’s gonna happen 
45 2018-11-21 23:58:16 Ford hasn't eliminated the gas prices learn how it works, they will be going up again he has no influence in the world-wide price of oil

47 2018-11-21 23:57:57 Couldn't agree more. I will take all the timely saves though, those win games....we will still need Talbot to find his game, he's not done yet.
48 2018-11-21 23:57:53 So Dale. Are you aware of growing western discontent? Western oil sells for about $15 per barrel now and Canada is losing about $80 million per day. See Great Bear Rain Forest, West Coast tanker ban, pipeline downstream emissions. Legacy of Butts. Stay tuned for - equalization $

52 2018-11-21 23:57:39 What’s it like being complicit in murder for money and oil?
53 2018-11-21 23:57:33 Has nothing to do with Saudi Arabia. We don't get that much of our oil from there.
54 2018-11-21 23:57:32 This looks great! I’m trying truffle oil seitan steaks from @MonksMeats this year.
55 2018-11-21 23:57:30 @Karim_Jivraj If you claim to defend free speech, why do you delete substantive criticism from your facebook page?

Or was your question, "Will you help me fight for our oil & gas sector?" purely rhetorical and meant to rile up your base with no real discussion?
56 2018-11-21 23:57:19 Resources so decimated we still keep selling them. All those logging camps, mines, oil rigs all gone...

Wait, that's not the reality at all. Service sector having a hard time finding workers these past months.
57 2018-11-21 23:57:17 Judges are never non partisan!! California judge was an oil hater.
58 2018-11-21 23:57:17 Oil $ Money > Human Life to this administration.
59 2018-11-21 23:57:16 Not worth a journalist life. Blood oil !
60 2018-11-21 23:57:02 Btw we only get 9% of our oil from them so wtf
61 2018-11-21 23:57:00 There should be a political comic drawing of Trump dressed as a prostitute, and he's just received a oil facial from sucking off the Saudi Prince on a huge pile of money, with bombs going off in the background #tytlive
62 2018-11-21 23:56:51 Oil diffuser ng diesel, gusto mo?
63 2018-11-21 23:56:47 Light crude oil went up 66% in 1973 and then 110% in 1974. 

Probably affected prices.
64 2018-11-21 23:56:41 They slam the President for everything I'm loving the lower oil prices.

66 2018-11-21 23:56:25 Since Pioneer is the visiting team in the 2018 @IHSAA1  Class A State Finals Game on Sat Nov 24, Panther fans should enter the East Gate of Lucas Oil Stadium after 11 AM & sit in Sections 108-113 & 208-213. 
#SFSBforTheWin #PantherPride #GOPANTHERS #FaceOfSportsmanship
67 2018-11-21 23:56:24 Why is he thanking Saudis? They’re only responsible for 11% of US oil. Canada is responsible for 40%!! Guess he’s working up an insanity plea because he knows his days are numbered. #MAGAMoron #TraitorTrump
68 2018-11-21 23:56:11 This kid just really put oil in the pan to make hamburgers 
69 2018-11-21 23:56:08 @espyforsenate @SpecialReport @WAGOP @nytimes @cnn @ChuckLane1 Espy is a hack snake oil salesman trying to do what dems do twist words to mean other than innocent intent b/c they lack ideas & integrity. DA Lane being a fake media hack, falls lockstep like the dim puppet he is!
70 2018-11-21 23:56:04 Has he been let down!? Unless I'm forgetting some players we definitely *should* have signed that would have got us above oil clubs like City and Chelsea, I don't really know if he's been let down. Weird. But to each their own.
71 2018-11-21 23:56:00 So how much do we charge ourselves for oil we dig up in our own backyard!?
72 2018-11-21 23:55:58 We get more oil from Canada than the 11% from Saudis.
73 2018-11-21 23:55:47 BIG POINTSaudi Arabia provides ONLY 9% of the oil to the USA while CANADA PROVIDES 40% !!Our Chief&Clown has thrown our most loyal & supportive neighbor under the bus w Tariffs & much disrespect BUT chooses to support MURDERERS! WE DON’T NEED MBS’ F**KNG OIL!DT, #GetOUT!
74 2018-11-21 23:55:47 They only provide about 11% of your oil
75 2018-11-21 23:55:41 grocery cashier: do you watch Netflix?
me: umm ... yes?
GC: have you seen Salt, Fat, Acid Heat?
me: uh. I’ve watched 3 out of 4  it’s great. also loved the book. 
GC: I THOUGHT so. looks like that’s something you’d like.   

legit was buying a bunch of veg and olive oil
76 2018-11-21 23:55:40 My family of Texans loves it without irony. And when my grandfather, longtime oil rig cowboy (read: worked a dangerous gig for men in scuff-free Stetsons) had Alzheimer’s, it was one of the last places in Texas we were welcome. #lubysforever
77 2018-11-21 23:55:37 Do you still have some mushrooms left? Toss with olive oil, onion slices and garlic, roast under the broiler for 5-10 minutes to get a deep color. Add to the gravy for deeper flavor
78 2018-11-21 23:55:36 They are trying to ruin the market for renewables by selling oil that undercuts them.
79 2018-11-21 23:55:36 9% of the oil used in America for gas is from Saudi Arabia.  But over 40% is from Canada. Once again, Drumpf is a liar.
80 2018-11-21 23:55:31 Here's another thought- dirt isn't always a bad thing- when it's in it's proper place, it's fine. It helps the plants grow to bear fruit and nourish other things. 
Or since you like cars- oil in an engine is fine, until it's out of it's place.
81 2018-11-21 23:55:30 Turkey may have an ulterior motive behind this. They're NOT our friend!
They've been playing footsies with Russia lately. They also conducted oil deals with ISIS when ISIS controlled Iraq.
Breaking our alliance with Saudi Arabia has Russia, Syria & Iran foaming at the mouth!
82 2018-11-21 23:55:17 Only because we’re recovering from a oil crash. We could certainly be doing much, much better.
83 2018-11-21 23:55:15 My car before and after an oil change is me before and after I eat.
84 2018-11-21 23:55:13 And won’t not be a rhetorical statement when Goddard is thinking about running for parliament. I hope he does, it’ll show him how embarrassingly little support he has amongst the electorate, same goes for Tommy. They won’t though, it’s not as profitable as selling snake oil.
85 2018-11-21 23:55:12 Doug ford, proving he's a snake oil salesman when he never says a single "red tape" he cut, and a moron when he says the cap and trade carbon tax. It'd be like saying someone was invited into your house break and entre.
86 2018-11-21 23:55:12 I need some damn olive oil 
87 2018-11-21 23:55:05 Further, it’s not ‘trading morals and ethics’ as you frame it.  It’s the very real cost of what would happen to every American if they stopped the oil again.  Remember the 70’s?  I do.  It would be worse today..  much worse.
88 2018-11-21 23:55:05 I am forever confused by the right-wing rhetoric that Alberta/Canada is getting ripped off on crude. Agree with the sentiment of getting oil to market, but how can the right use this as a knock on the liberals and NDP, they had united power between AB/Canada for a decade #ABPoli
89 2018-11-21 23:55:05 Thank you Canada! You supply the most of our oil 
90 2018-11-21 23:54:59 Yeah but they have lots of money or oil and all that other strategic  partnership bs so nothing will happen. The upside down.
91 2018-11-21 23:54:58 Yeah, with their statistically higher frequency of charitable donations and volunteer work.  How dare they
92 2018-11-21 23:54:54 Why does no one understand anything about OPEC? I was kid during 70s when oil crisis happened. AMERICANS need to learn about how, and who, sets oil prices, and why, Also how futures traders manipulate the market. Basics aren't hard to understand even though it is a complex topic.
93 2018-11-21 23:54:50 Water and oil can’t mix
94 2018-11-21 23:54:47 Disinformation is key to keeping "the plan" together. JFK Jr is in the ground and staying there. 9/11 was a money scheme through and through, and an excuse to invade the middle east to destabilize the oil barons. You're not very good at this critical thinking and research. #qanon
95 2018-11-21 23:54:39 @the_gothamista HI there! What is your recommendation for  over exfoliated skin? Which moisturizer, mask, face oil? Any recommendation would be welcome. Thank you
96 2018-11-21 23:54:38 I vape with a purpose...CBD oil. It makes me feel better. So there ! 
97 2018-11-21 23:54:36 How come no news about the largest oil spill ever that is happening on the east coast?  It's news or hold on a sec .. It's not American news... Never mind
98 2018-11-21 23:54:36 100% of the palm fruit oil used in Nairn’s products is RSPO certified sustainably sourced and from a segregated supply chain.
99 2018-11-21 23:54:36 Have a look online for Abu Dhabi’s 2030 plan... it’s all about building income streams away from Oil... and building the countries brand & influence globally. Sadly Premier League has made it too easy for owners to do what they like in spite of what fans believe or want.
100 2018-11-21 23:54:19 And someone making $$$ not the consumer
in my area gas prices have not gone down
and friends in the north still paying premium for home heating oil
when will folk trumpsters or not just get a grip and vote smarter?
101 2018-11-21 23:54:16 What oil do y’all use when you have braids in?
102 2018-11-21 23:54:12 Sassafras trees don't grow in jungles from what I've found. You only need a bit of the root to extract the oil as well, as the tree can regrow the roots
103 2018-11-21 23:54:11 Oh, and they lowered oil prices today.
104 2018-11-21 23:54:11 Pro tip: 
Reheat mac & cheese on 50% power to avoid cheese and oil separation.
105 2018-11-21 23:54:01 coconut oil and a healthy diet;)

i only do one of them lmaoo
106 2018-11-21 23:53:58 Something has to make up for the stupid tarriffs when they kick in. No wonder you went bankrupt so many times. Heck, we get more oil from other countries than Saudi Arabia but you're a brown noser when it comes to people who line your pockets.
107 2018-11-21 23:53:57 And just think, Nenshi gave them $150k back in 2012. Nenshi. Mayor of oil capital Canada, gave oil workers tax dollars to the resistance. He’s as much to blame as Notley, Turdy & BC in our pipeline mess. Our very own elected resident evil.
108 2018-11-21 23:53:54 We in Alberta don’t exist and neither does our oil!
109 2018-11-21 23:53:50 What do you think of a drive to help provide heat to folks in need, over the winter? 

Perhaps via small room space heaters? 

Or possibly by helping out with heating bills from gas/electric/oil companies? (Though I'm not ckear how the number crunching for this would work.)
110 2018-11-21 23:53:49 Are they the stainless? I found I had to oil mine. As they are carbon steal. And they will rust if you don't. 

And asguard it is!
111 2018-11-21 23:53:47 Not “Great” for Oil Field WORKERS!!!!
112 2018-11-21 23:53:43 Too bad Canada supplies 5 times as much oil as Saudi Arabia  shouldn't 45 be kissing Justin's ass
113 2018-11-21 23:53:40 everytime i drive back to mission from southwestern or vice versa i always make sure to stop by the circle-k valero in that town where there's the huge oil refinery. it's basically a tradition at this point.
114 2018-11-21 23:53:34 Getting oil from Canada would make oil and gasoline prices drop even lower.
115 2018-11-21 23:53:32 Why is it Trump forgives despots, murderers, dictators who flash the big  bucks, offer their oil resources and deny their crimes? Shame on you Trump, 1000 x shame! He craves approval so desperately he's selling US out! #TrumpCallingAllBullies
#AttnWorldDespotsTrumpWantsYou
116 2018-11-21 23:53:31 1. Reading comprehension much?! ("and the World")
2. Oil price is dependent on *global* (know that word?) markets.
2. You are stupid. Congratulations.
117 2018-11-21 23:53:28 Don't think anyone would like to invade Canada now, too much criminal immigrants there. But as to the oil, SA and more specifically OPEC decide the price of oil through production. So CBC is not very smart.
118 2018-11-21 23:53:28 Totally false statement #POTUS  It's your pocket that is your only concern and lower oil prices were not from Saudi oil you fool! LMAO
119 2018-11-21 23:53:25 Um, we get Canadian oil. 
From a town in BC called.. Pleasure ( don’t tell him)
120 2018-11-21 23:53:23 I started using this new face mask & I love it! & for a glow use vitamin e oil or face creams that have it! It’s the best & really hydrates
121 2018-11-21 23:53:22 We need a larger and larger profit motive to find the oil world needs. It is getting harder and harder to find. Don’t be shortsighted.
122 2018-11-21 23:53:21 Oh Ya ! Penut Oil Fryed!
123 2018-11-21 23:53:19 อูจินค่าา
124 2018-11-21 23:53:11 no they are hardcore and just deal with oil popping on their balls
125 2018-11-21 23:52:54 Rosehip oil!!
126 2018-11-21 23:52:54 Dear Loyal Titans Fans, not having heard from you in a great while, I did not know but what you would like to hear where I am dead or alive. I am in good spirits at present despite my loss of feeling by hand. We had an awful match and terrible battle at Lucas Oil Field....
127 2018-11-21 23:52:42 Some butter and oil
128 2018-11-21 23:52:42 May aloe vera oil si mama HAHA!
129 2018-11-21 23:52:33 I was today years old when I realized "vegetable oil" is just relabeled soybean oil 85% of the time
130 2018-11-21 23:52:27 When I went to Seattle last year, bought 2 pure CBD oil vape cartridges. The results were incredible. It would be wonderful if I could get it locally.
131 2018-11-21 23:52:24 Note that Syria would be self-efficient with oil fields east of Euphrates. So, to Syrian Government long term priority is to liberate east Syria. But for now, Idlib must come first.
132 2018-11-21 23:52:20 Saudi Arabia is placating oil thirsty America to take the focus away from State Murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Its like a "Bribe", President Trump
133 2018-11-21 23:52:17 Oil prices are dropping due to lower demand. The world economy is shrinking due to trade wars that you started, and with that our economy will shrink too. Dumb move!
134 2018-11-21 23:52:16 basically, it's like a cross between melting down a shoelace with a cigarette lighter, the process through which plant matter becomes oil, and bitcoin mining.
135 2018-11-21 23:52:16 Canada provides more of our oil than Saudi ...Trump is supporting a murderer and he continues to sleep & tweet just fine
136 2018-11-21 23:52:10 We get 4x more oil from Canada. @MSNBC @CNN @maddow @Lawrence never mention that. Why?
137 2018-11-21 23:52:06 Under Trump soon oil will be free and we will just need to allow X number of journalists to be murdered per month to keep it that way.
138 2018-11-21 23:51:58 I’ve been dreading to come to the dealership for this oil change 
139 2018-11-21 23:51:58 Something I’d never do, but I believe the worst outcomes (hot oil all over the place) occur when the turkey isn’t completely thawed.
140 2018-11-21 23:51:54 Hmmm,nothing mentioned when oil prices were up now was there.Why are we dependent on Saudi Arabia anyway.
141 2018-11-21 23:51:40 Perhaps Canada should limit its exports to the US, so that it doesn't have to import oil from places like Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Nigeria. If Canada had such a vast amount of its own oil then why does it import any at all?
142 2018-11-21 23:51:26 Great achievement, now you can learn how to check the oil!
143 2018-11-21 23:51:26 Your horrid bowing to the Saudi regime is a disgrace! I want justice for the #KhashoggiMurder, don’t try to distract us with oil prices!!
144 2018-11-21 23:51:23 Let’s go to war with Saudi Arabia now! Wreck the oil market just in time for the holidays!

For a Muslim Brotherhood Al Qaeda affiliate the MSM has been lying about for a month.

Because justice. And reasons. And sweet, sweet virtue signal dopamine hits from that like button.
145 2018-11-21 23:51:19 Love it! Someone said put real slick oil on the walls and they can’t climb over. Sounded pretty good!
146 2018-11-21 23:51:17 Okay, enough for fuck sakes. First I have to put up with rain on most of my (3Days) off and now I see tomorrow, which I slated to do oil changes is going to be high of 34 and low of 19. Mother nature you cunt stop fucking with me!
147 2018-11-21 23:51:15 I have a broom cupboard to store my mode of transport to saving lives 2 at a time but I don’t use essential oil in its engine.
148 2018-11-21 23:51:12 im not a precise kind of girl, i use coconut oil on my hands and rub all around til my face streamed w black.  I’ll send u a pic tonight 
149 2018-11-21 23:51:10 How high does the Crown Prince need to hike his robe for you to kiss his oil prices?
150 2018-11-21 23:51:09 @RachelNotley's oil 'special envoy,' compared CDN ethical oil to landmines; said we should "produce great deal less hydrocarbon energy."; called for ban of fossil-fuelled cars in cities;  develop failed carbon tax-for-pipeline scheme. 

Why'd she leave out  @TzeporahBerman ?
151 2018-11-21 23:51:02 Heard someone say today that Canada supplies 40% of Americas oil, Saudi Arabia supplies only 9%. Treats Canada like shit, bows to the Saudis, bows to Putin & bows to Kim..what's the deal people?
152 2018-11-21 23:50:59 And Cdn. oil is cheaper for US  to import !
153 2018-11-21 23:50:56 The club have shown they have no ambition so what makes you think we’ll attract players with the opposite mindset. Atleast the oil clubs use their money effectively, we use it to stack deadwood and buy finished players.
154 2018-11-21 23:50:49 Bwat Vazlin ak Baby oil li tap voye achte...
155 2018-11-21 23:50:48 Pitchers could slather motor oil on it, and yes...they used the same ball all the time making it almost impossible to see.  They traveled by train, no modern technology etc. He changed and dominated the game and country like no other HUMAN.  Griffey was great.  He’s no Babe Ruth
156 2018-11-21 23:50:47 So, I actually have some of this oil of oregano, another kind, but high-quality also.  How much should I take?  It's only for occasional use, right?
157 2018-11-21 23:50:14 This is exactly how the mind of a #MagaMoron works. Had the nirdeetof Kashoggi raised oil prices and benefitted this man, he'd be all for it and on his knees next to suck off Trump.
158 2018-11-21 23:49:55 CeraVe Daily Moisturizing lotion (It’s expensive, but it’s my holy grail), Aquaphor (I usually get the two pack for easy carry), Vitamin E oil, and a facial serum with hyaluronic acid (this help retains moisture), and you can usually find a cheap bottle at TJ Maxx.
159 2018-11-21 23:49:48 We can do without their oil. *You* can't do without their bribes.  Funny how you make everything about you, unless it's something illegal. Then you spin it like it's for us. We get more oil from Canada than SA!
160 2018-11-21 23:49:46 What is baby oil even for? It’s not like babies need oil like robots. Unless they do. Are babies robots?
161 2018-11-21 23:49:34 Dear President Trump,with all the agencies under your authority,tell us whether the crown prince was directly involved in the assasination.Yes or no? Second,the most important product for the US economy is the values of human rights and not the oil.

162 2018-11-21 23:49:26 Thank you Saudi Arabia?  The nation who crashed our economy in the 70’s?  The nation who joined Russia last year and ran oil to $80 a barrel?

Your loyalty to corrupt despots and murderers is appalling.
163 2018-11-21 23:49:23 ITS THE EASIEST !!!! 
- boil the gnocchis, set aside
- in a large pan, lots of crushed garlic, a bit of oil, lots of butter and lots dried or fresh parsley/salt/pepper
- when the butter melts and it starts to smell really good, add the gnocchis. 
- sauté for 5 minutes or so
DONE!
164 2018-11-21 23:49:21 Saudi oil is 4% of our import.  Canada 40%  We are not dependent on Saudi's why 
is our heating oil still so HIGH????
165 2018-11-21 23:49:14 < #油song の曲目から、中の人が主に誰のペンか想像がつくと思います…ふふっ
166 2018-11-21 23:49:11 One thing I have noticed with mst Nigerians is dat when the oil frm the bursted pipe is flowing though there household  every thing in Nigeria seems to be working out fine to them without putting others into consideration but as soon as there person gets voted out boom 
167 2018-11-21 23:49:09 1. My country. I was born & spent the first years of my life there

2. One of the fastest growing economy in the western hemisphere that will probably grown at an even faster rate when oil production starts

3. I'm proud of how the country is developing while actively seeking
168 2018-11-21 23:49:05 What oil helps your lashes grow?
169 2018-11-21 23:49:03 To make you feel better I had to spend $640 on my car today then after I left the dealership my car broke down bc they put too much oil in it 
170 2018-11-21 23:49:00 Telling you this for ideas.  I’ve tried 2 different companies CBD oil,  can’t tell I’m taking it.  Mark Bajerski’s healing oil is wonderful but comes in 1 oz bottle $22,  lowers pain level or makes it go away completely.  I had been on same pain meds & strengths 8 years
171 2018-11-21 23:48:54 Canada sends you more oil than the Saudis if I could I would shut the taps off just to prove a point.
172 2018-11-21 23:48:46 Abolish oil/gas companies, seize their wealth and imprison all officials/leaders for crimes against humanity and planet.
173 2018-11-21 23:48:42 If the evil saudis didn't horde so much of the world's oil demand, poor oil countries could've kept its citizens from leaving for a better country. When oil prices were high, the UN could've used syria's oil to help build syrian sanctuaries for ppl to not invade Europe
174 2018-11-21 23:48:42 Trump saying he wants lower oil prices from the Saudi's is like him asking for a great stock market, it would appear he is screwing up both markets. Everyone does remember he filed for bankruptcy 6 times. This clown is ruining the soy bean market and much more. GET HIM OUT!
175 2018-11-21 23:48:32 Only 11% of our oil comes from SA. 40% Is from Canada. So what’s the real story
176 2018-11-21 23:48:32 Those oil prices and that arms deal tho. That is America First.
177 2018-11-21 23:48:24 The oil Andrew's grandma put on his head wasn't for socialism. It was the oil of the holy spirit. He would have won every single black woman #vote if he were a Christian conservative. No Muslims, socialists.
178 2018-11-21 23:48:17 Extra virgin cold pressed coconut oil is my secret a teaspoon couple times a week
179 2018-11-21 23:48:14 I'm willing, and would rather, pay more for my oil. #Kashoggi
180 2018-11-21 23:48:09 They should make a topical rub or chewables with pheromones in them and call it CBD-LS oil. It makes you irresistible to women and impervious to alcohol. #cdls
@AllmericanMayes @Colby_Daniels @CaraRice107
181 2018-11-21 23:48:08 Buy Canadian oil. Keep USA money out of our elections
182 2018-11-21 23:47:53 We would gladly pay more for oil (which we don’t need to be dependent upon) for sending a strong signal that murdering journalists is against everything that our America stands for. Trump must go. Now.
183 2018-11-21 23:47:51 I use natural coconut oil
184 2018-11-21 23:47:50 Who cares if they kill journalists, as long as we save money on oil. We have never had an amoral president like you and I hope we never do again.
185 2018-11-21 23:47:45 Canada produces 40% of our oil. Saudi Arabia 9%. 
Do you see the bullshit? Guaranteed his followers don’t.
186 2018-11-21 23:47:44 How can you thank the Saudis? We only get 10% of our oil from them! You're a sell out!
187 2018-11-21 23:47:42 The only moisture on a good Italian sub should come from some combination of vinegar and/or oil. That's it. End of list.
188 2018-11-21 23:47:39 That’s not great for a lot of us in the “red states” who depend on the oil industry.  LOVE YOU but not lower oil prices.
189 2018-11-21 23:47:35 Well said. I am enjoying the lower cost of oil. I think the Dems are pushing this so they can excoriate him after he does it.  No pleasing these people.
190 2018-11-21 23:47:35 Especially galling when you consider Saudi Arabia doesn’t control oil prices. This is Trump playing to the echo chamber.
191 2018-11-21 23:47:33 I have doused myself with patchouli oil.
192 2018-11-21 23:47:29 Oil prices are cyclical dotard.
193 2018-11-21 23:47:24 Maybe if you cough up little Donny to the Saudis for another execution the price of oil will drop even more
194 2018-11-21 23:47:19 USA is the largest producer of oil in the world. We don't need Saudi Arabia any more, with their tyranny, war crimes and humans rights violations. Saudi Arabia is literally an evil dictatorship currently causing a genocide on the people of Yemen. GTFOH
195 2018-11-21 23:47:05 كلامك عين العقل يا بومحمد وكلنا مع التغيير . ١٨ سنه فشل حرام والله
196 2018-11-21 23:47:01 Thank you to Saudi Arabia, which has maintained the stability of the global economy and supported the US economy in 500 billion dollars, which provided jobs for the Americans and Saudi oil is more than 50% and not 11%
197 2018-11-21 23:47:00 have you come to chance the oil in my cadillac?
198 2018-11-21 23:47:00 Has she been buying oil for her car again love?
199 2018-11-21 23:46:53 Ummm I thought we didn’t need their oil?
200 2018-11-21 23:46:47 And I'm thinking low oil prices means rising unemployment and depressed economies in oil producing states like the one I live in. I own a home services company and lost about 15% of my revenue in the 2015 drop, due to canceled contracts from oilfield workers.
201 2018-11-21 23:46:46 Also...you put oil and vinegar on an Italian. Dumb DC people
202 2018-11-21 23:46:45 Again, if you show me that you can buy a basket of groceries in any developed country of your choosing with an ounce of gold, I will admit gold is real money. Otherwise, it's a commodity, just like oil, platinum, lemons, etc.
203 2018-11-21 23:46:44 Oil price changes out of Saudi don’t necesaarily translate into lower gas prices at the pump.
204 2018-11-21 23:46:43 Oil and arms and condo sales. Make Trump, inc lucrative again.
205 2018-11-21 23:46:42 Run on Fryer Oil bro. Having a car smell like french fries all the time is a wonderful upside.
206 2018-11-21 23:46:39 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
207 2018-11-21 23:46:36 Lol.  #Yasuní (most megabiodiverse zone one Earth is being EXPLOITED FOR OIL, wait, it has uncontacted tribes there) and NOW you seem to care about indigenous tribes.
208 2018-11-21 23:46:25 I've also found out that a chocolate manufacturer who doesn't use palm oil and cause the death of orangutans is Green & Black - so I I shall endeavour to buy their products now instead of my former favourite (which led to Thorny ground).
209 2018-11-21 23:46:20 ありがとうございますあります、本当ですよ？笑
210 2018-11-21 23:46:19 Because of the belief some Americans have that US can't survive without Saudi oil. 
Saudi oil is only 11% of the oil US uses.

212 2018-11-21 23:46:11 Trump: Thank you, Saudi, for lowering the price of oil in the US. Actually, should say thank you, Justin. Most imported oil in the US comes from Canada.
213 2018-11-21 23:46:04 Kathmandu Honey oil, 1973. An extraordinary year. Mild off the knife with a robust finish and zero redeye or limp lid. Perfect companion to a bike ride to the monkey temple and Om again.
214 2018-11-21 23:46:04 i have a theory that the e.coli romaine lettuce outbreak is linked to the ease of regulations on the oil and gas industries
215 2018-11-21 23:45:55 You must not be aware of Trump’s Twitter account. Never witnessed such an insecure, thin-skinned manchild so desperate for validation. What kind of misguided person looks at that and sees strength? 
216 2018-11-21 23:45:51 No. We take no side and stay out of the middle east. We won't need them for oil much longer, with whats going down in Texas.  When I say I'm against all forms of extremist islam im not just talking about countries who arent our allies. wahabism is a cancer.
217 2018-11-21 23:45:47 I don’t understand that part because the U.S is sitting on a lake of oil in Alaska
218 2018-11-21 23:45:46 Low oil prices due to America’s own fracking. Hate fracking but the truth behind oil prices is important. But pls check facts.

220 2018-11-21 23:45:37 When the conversation on the day before Thanksgiving is about, 
The price of human life over the price of a barrel of oil. 

Trump has made America a Monster. 

Trump must go!

Country over President.
221 2018-11-21 23:45:34 Does that mean it's okay if you have oil or weapons contracts worth $17 billion?
222 2018-11-21 23:45:33 Correction with enough oil you mean.
223 2018-11-21 23:45:32 The pricing of OIL is complex with many oil producing nations involved. Saudi Arabia IS NOT SOLEY responsible for the fall in oil prices. AS PER USUAL YOU are just feeding BS to your none too smart MAGATS. Smart people know the FACTS. Unlike #MAGA
224 2018-11-21 23:45:31 Liberals should thank Mr Trump! He is whoring himself for lower oil prices! Keep on Whoring, Mr Illegitimate President!
225 2018-11-21 23:45:11 The castor oil is actually a great tip though. I apply a little bit every morning before my moisturiser, it’s really good for your skin and doesn’t block your pores. Get the black Jamaican kind!
226 2018-11-21 23:45:10 If @realDonaldTrump hammered #SaudiArabia over this #Kashoggi mess by sanctioning/pulling back with regards to oil then Russia&China would jump in and fill the void left by the US absence. THE FAKE NEWS can keep throwing shots but this is reality... there are bigger chips at play
227 2018-11-21 23:45:07 I'm old enough to remember when oil above $50 was a choke-hold on the economy. Old Rules, apparently.
228 2018-11-21 23:45:03 Just spent $25 on fish oil for my kid. Holy crap.
229 2018-11-21 23:45:02 Don't we import most of our oil from Canada? Oh, I forgot... Trump hates them, too.
230 2018-11-21 23:44:49 Or we could push for sustainable vehicles and not worry about how much a barrel of oil costs!??
231 2018-11-21 23:44:35 Hi Stian!  Well, now they are hit again by an oil price hit.  I know a lady in Kazahkastan and she noted months ago their economy was hit hard by sanctions and their currency devaluation. So, it must be worse now. 800 is a bigger number than I thought. To me it does not look good
232 2018-11-21 23:44:35 It’s mad. Tearing up rainforests for palm oil is another. No wonder the world’s fucked. Look out, starting to rant meself!
233 2018-11-21 23:44:28 The Albertans I’m talking about aren’t in the Oil Patch. I’m told Edmonton/Calgary are progressive, beautiful and wonderful cities. I live near Red Deer. There are some good folks (my teacher is one of them), but people here feel safe enough to say there’s few real Canadians left
234 2018-11-21 23:44:27 We going back to the caravan now.  Guess I need to Chang the subject of #LockHerUpIvanka for ahem emails.  My stupid remarks about the Supreme Court, thanking a murderous regime for a fake oil cut.  Don’t let this tweet take you from the fact that America is last for me.
235 2018-11-21 23:44:19 The US gets 40% of oil of Canada and 11% from the Saudi.......and Canada do not torture and slice journalists. Anyhow he is after the Canadians but not the Saudi. I do not get it!!!!!!
236 2018-11-21 23:44:12 @realDonaldTrump so lower oil prices causes loss of jobs pay cuts and layoffs. I work in the oil and gas Industry and have been through 3 downturns. They are not pretty as you can imagine millions of Americans struggling. So the industry that backs you so much it’s hurting us.
237 2018-11-21 23:44:09 Why are so many concerned about selling military vehicles and arms to Saudia Arabia but no one says anything about the fact that we continue to buy their oil?
238 2018-11-21 23:44:05 That ignorant does not know that oil prices are low and will be getting lower bc of the USA production and decline in use around the world???
239 2018-11-21 23:44:00 Lower oil prices may hurt oil companies but its foolish to say they hurt the stock market overall, it's the reverse.
240 2018-11-21 23:43:58 Have you remembered to oil your frets this month? 
241 2018-11-21 23:43:56 well, evidently you changed your oil at the right mileage. 44226, right?
242 2018-11-21 23:43:53 I hear you,

But I've known of Trump for a long time. My guess is he is talking up the oil price decline to deflect criticism of him. Economic activity is down and the expected decline in Iranian supplies hasn't yet occurred substantially. 

He cares about HIS acount
243 2018-11-21 23:43:48 Actually it was higher in part because of trump, even Putin said so.  Putin said “oil prices are to some extent the result of the Trump administration. I'm talking about sanctions against Iran, about political problems in Venezuela &  just looking at what's happening in Libya."
244 2018-11-21 23:43:48 What does Schumer have against lower oil prices-----could it be that his high income can afford to pay more VS the middle class he is supposed to represent
245 2018-11-21 23:43:46 Trump you aren't the first one that oil prices went down so please stop bragging like you've done something new or better then any other President, only thing you can claim is being the worst leader of USA Ever. Resign or it's going to get worst for you & your family,count on it.
246 2018-11-21 23:43:43 I disagree with you. This is about if we are a country of moral and ethical values or (sadly) one of "interests". A journalist was murdered because he spoke out against oppressive leadership...this free speech is the FOUNDATION of our nation. Not oil and cash.
247 2018-11-21 23:43:35 Just what guru Trudeau wants destroy our oil business to virtue signal at all our expense to his carbon cult globalist
248 2018-11-21 23:43:34 #Trump #realDonaldTrump #potus  ignores murder for oil. Oh wait he was a journalist. #realDonaldTrump hates the press
249 2018-11-21 23:43:27 Let me understand this, oil prices and weapon sales are more important than the life of an innocent US resident?  I'm disgusted at this president.  Since when is murder justifiable by money?
250 2018-11-21 23:43:20 Haunted house au set in a penthouse apartment featuring Tao, an apathetic library assistant. He deeply offends Minseok , a waiter with a bottle of oil. A  makes everything worse.
251 2018-11-21 23:43:18 Do you think that cutting off Canadian oil would be a wake-up call for this ninny?
252 2018-11-21 23:43:09 まあわたしは今回古戦場全く走れてないんですけど
253 2018-11-21 23:43:09 Yup OIL SPILLS are Guaranteed to happen, just dont know when,BUT it's A Guarantee it will, So  canaDUH, its Gov. Should just DUMMIE UP now and just say NO to NATURAL DISASTER PIPELINES to B.C.'s Coast or it will be Toast.  Say NO to KM PIPELINES.
254 2018-11-21 23:42:57 It’s so sad that you would place the cost of oil over someone’s human rights. It is disgusting.
255 2018-11-21 23:42:57 Yes indeed 40% of our oil import is from Canada...Saudi is only 7%
256 2018-11-21 23:42:56 If you invent something that will cut into the pockets of oil companies. They will find a way to buy your patent so it can not be marketed. It doesn’t matter that it can save our planet . Save us money . What matters to them is power and to make more money
257 2018-11-21 23:42:52 BC has oil.
258 2018-11-21 23:42:44 Except we are trading with that country in oil and arms. If our country is guided exclusively by self-interest without some sort of values or then we as a nation are behaving in a manner where we lose our American exceptionalism, no longer the beacon on the hill.
259 2018-11-21 23:42:42 You do realize that as oil prices go lower & lower, American oil companies lose profits & lay off workers, right? And red states with oil dependent economies lose tax revenue. Right? And people in those states lose jobs. Of course you don’t, because you are simple minded.
260 2018-11-21 23:42:39 Yesereee Chuckee - let’s jack up those oil prices for the average American!
261 2018-11-21 23:42:36 Sadly our country has a 70+ year history of looking the other way at Saudi actions in exchange for stable oil prices. No one is asking Coke and Pepsi to stop selling there.  Imperfect world.
262 2018-11-21 23:42:34 โดนเข้าไปเต็มๆแล้วเนี่ย555
263 2018-11-21 23:42:30 Don't ask me. Canada produces a lot of oil. Our gas prices are outrageous. Shell is a Dutch company. Gas prices in the Netherlands is even higher. Maybe someone reading this post can explain.
264 2018-11-21 23:42:29 My philosophy? Fuck it! I've cosplayed plenty of times in the past REGARDLESS of what I Iooked like. All that matters is that you like doing it. Cosplay is like art. You can do whatever you want! Take creative liberties! Keep on doin' you!
265 2018-11-21 23:42:29 You should be thanking the Canadians.  40% of our oil comes from there.  10% from Saudi. BTW the US produces more oil than ALL other countries.
266 2018-11-21 23:42:18 Ally of a Man that trades oil for lives?????
267 2018-11-21 23:42:12 いうて@hakka_oil には割といるんですけど
268 2018-11-21 23:42:10 So when oil went from $50 under Obama to $82 just a few days ago, it was a big Tax Hike for America and the World. Didn't Enjoy !!
269 2018-11-21 23:42:09 Pres. Trump, I'm 79, and like many retirees, depend on dividends from my investments.  We've suffered from oil prices since 2014 and now you give the Saudis a break instead of your own people.  Don't support the pipelines and not the producers!  Let the market work.  Stay out!
270 2018-11-21 23:42:07 
271 2018-11-21 23:42:00 100% agree! Time for the oil industry leaders to read the “Art of War!”!  10% Reduction in shipments per month from Alta until a pipeline is approved!
272 2018-11-21 23:41:59 Oil prices are falling because everyone sees the huge Trump recession just around the corner.
Putting lots of Trump voters in shale country out of jobs too. Sad!
273 2018-11-21 23:41:58 I added MCT oil to my coffee but also 2 shots of hazelnut kahlua sooo
274 2018-11-21 23:41:54 40% of USA oil comes from Canada with only 11% coming from Saudi Arabia - don't thank Saudi Arabia - thank Justin Trudeau and Canada for lower oil prices #DonaldTrumpIdiot
275 2018-11-21 23:41:54 Avon care; recovered coconut oil
276 2018-11-21 23:41:53 @DonaldJTrumpJr @KellyannePolls @PressSec @kimguilfoyle @DonaldJTrumpJr  you do understand lower oil prices than what they are now,will mean layoffs again for oil workers.the expense of drilling by the companies is too great for lower than 50.....please don't wish for lower...
277 2018-11-21 23:41:51 USA gets <less than 10 of its oil imports from Saud. This ain’t about oil. It’s about condos and loans and secrets.
278 2018-11-21 23:41:50 I expect more from a European democracy like Norway.

Norwegians are no longer hunter/gatherers.
You are an oil rich nation.
You don't have to exploit endangered species anymore.
Stop it!
It makes you look Neanderthal.
279 2018-11-21 23:41:50 That’s wonderful!  I had hoped for that w/ oil b/c my pain is pretty much all over.  Neck into my hair, shoulders, spine, hips, thighs, knees, calves, feet.  I have fibromyalgia (code for mystery syndrome), degenerative disc, (2 fusions, 3 bulging) scoliosis.  1/2
280 2018-11-21 23:41:46 Can I go and extract unrefined oil from the ground and sell it? Your abstract notion of property being natural resources improved by labour doesn't hold up in practice.
281 2018-11-21 23:41:44 Might?  You'd still vote for Trump 
regardless of oil prices?
282 2018-11-21 23:41:34 How stupid.  Texas sure does not thank you for lower oil prices.  Geez- you don’t get it.  Stop meddling in our world. Just go golf for 2 years and get out of our way.
283 2018-11-21 23:41:29 I'm all for green energy etc. However oil is the economic lifeblood and anyone blocking pipelines needs to realize how much more danger, rail transport is...to human and animal life as well as the ecosystem. Pipelines are a FAR safer route. #albertaoil
284 2018-11-21 23:41:28 Let's see what Black Friday holds for the Oil and Gas collosus.
We can bet that process will be up to at least $3.00 a gallon before Christmas.
What will you say then?
Blame it on President Obama?
The 9th circuit court?
Never your fault, huh?
Child
285 2018-11-21 23:41:26 The one thing I must have is lip balm, and I know I would have to learn to make an alternative...a little beeswax, maybe sunflower oil, etc. Anything else I would either learn to live without or find alternatives.
286 2018-11-21 23:41:24 DOTARD is for DOTARD ok he preaches to his zombies  his base of 34% please! Go talk to a wall trump@you make no sense we have our oil you lie about everything it’s always about YOU and it’s NOT America first but Saudi first it’s Heleski all over again
287 2018-11-21 23:41:10 Just think if Canada remains on this course with the increasing debt load and the failure to get its oil to global markets we could become one of the worlds biggest THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES. I like Canada too much to see this. We have 2 change! Trudeau must GO!
288 2018-11-21 23:41:07 Well, #BLOTUS does need the oil from the #Saudis, to get good and lubed up for #PUTIN!
289 2018-11-21 23:41:04 Shooting school kids and invading countries for their oil
290 2018-11-21 23:41:04 and you forgot to mention that in the meanwhile US have stolen Syria own oil ressources at the profit of kurds
291 2018-11-21 23:41:03 Step 1: put 3 drops of pure almond oil in your diffuser

Step 2: thank me
292 2018-11-21 23:40:55 That looks delicious.  But you cannot Fry.  Without.  Oil.  That turkey's roasted.

I would totally eat it, however.
293 2018-11-21 23:40:54 @POTUS so you think Saudi Arabia slowing lowering over oil prices for you you know what you made America great already you don't need to serve another 4 years you've done your job #missionaccomplished #MAGA America's great Donald did his job we don't need him anymore
294 2018-11-21 23:40:52 Saudi Arabia provides about 10% of the oil we use.
295 2018-11-21 23:40:48 No one country can make a big difference in oil prices. It is determined by a commodities market. This is your own idea, right, because ANYONE else would know better.
296 2018-11-21 23:40:40 When I taught studio programs, the glitter was under lock and key in a metal case like linseed oil. You had to make a serious case to use it.
297 2018-11-21 23:40:39 Pick a cannabis base and I'll give you whatever.  Tincture, oil, or concentrate.
298 2018-11-21 23:40:36 I stopped reading about the oil differential solution in the linked article when B Topp brought up climate change.

Ms. Notley - please bring in someone with knowledge of the oil industry to replace Mr. Topp.
299 2018-11-21 23:40:36 "With market access and a competitive investment climate, the oil and natural gas industry has the potential to add 120,000 additional long-term jobs to the Canadian economy over the next decade.
300 2018-11-21 23:40:36 Thank Canada  40% oil from here  only 11 % from Saudi murderer
301 2018-11-21 23:40:27 America gets most if its oil from Canada, three times more than from Saudi Arabia.
302 2018-11-21 23:40:23 engl*nd gonna start a war against scotland bc of OIL watch this space
303 2018-11-21 23:40:23 August saw the largest annual increase in u.s. oil production in 98 years
304 2018-11-21 23:40:21 Hi. Does Dove contain palm oil?
305 2018-11-21 23:40:20 If you are whining about how Trump did not throw away diplomatic relations with our Oil supply just because of one turkish life, then you are as neurotic as a sjw
grow tf up
306 2018-11-21 23:40:17 少年漫画か？最高だな
307 2018-11-21 23:40:16 Wow, I had no idea! I guess I just kind of assumed that Alberta is full of people from other provinces ... so many Nova Scotians have moved there to work in the oil patch. That's really an eye-opener.
308 2018-11-21 23:40:14 Saudi’s have the most oil reserves and the lowest production cost. They can singlehandedly affect the price of oil. They did a linear study and found that $60 is the sweet spot where crackers go bankrupt but still keeps the Saudi’s in decent financial shape.
309 2018-11-21 23:40:11 知ってる？大学って大して重要じゃないんだよ。焦ってる暇あったら油、飲も？
310 2018-11-21 23:40:08 not half annoyin when people complain that we stop using plastic straws to save the fish but we’re still eating fish or we’re stoppin using palm oil to save the animals in the rainforest but we still eat chickens n cows it’s not all or nothing u slack cunts every little helps!!
311 2018-11-21 23:40:01 You better hope the Flames don't win tonight. You don't want us to have first in the Pacific all to ourselves. It won't be relinquished. #cupchamps2018 #cowtownchampagnecampaign
312 2018-11-21 23:39:54 Fuck it even olive/sunflower oil on a cloth  works in a pinch but her first thought was to come online and rant at a stranger. What boggled me is she said she had tried other morphe palettes and never had an issue but in my experience they all stain,especially the red and purples
313 2018-11-21 23:39:52 They want him to turn blind eye to their behaviors and keep buying their oil nit Russia's.
314 2018-11-21 23:39:47 Yes or perhaps it’s like motor oil for the cardiac system! My grandmother loved a drink (I think) tho I didn’t know this until my Dad brought her a in the Nursing home one time when I was home visiting them, she lived to 95!
315 2018-11-21 23:39:37 Dear President Trump,with all the agencies under your authority,tell us whether the crown prince was directly involved in the assasination.Yes or no? Second,the most important product for the US economy is the values of human rights and not the oil.

316 2018-11-21 23:39:34 It’s sad that you’re trading dead Americans for oil. BTW... the US gets its majority of import from Canada. #PresidentBoneSpurs
317 2018-11-21 23:39:26 Besides you kissing up to the  Saudi Prince, you know that America exports oil, right?  And the lower prices hurts America's oil companies, including a couple on the Dow 30?
318 2018-11-21 23:39:20 Could have sworn I had a bottle of Olbas Oil here somewhere. It's the kind of thing Inalways see lying around...until I actually need it!
319 2018-11-21 23:39:19 No burning the midnight oil for you then Mark ? Nite friend xxsweet dreams
320 2018-11-21 23:39:05 Donald Trump has just tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to 'a big Tax Cut for America and the World!' In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia. CBC
321 2018-11-21 23:38:56 Of course we will still need a small amount of oil/coal for certain things; large industrial machinery, backup generators, etc...
But a huge transformation to green energy is completely doable.
322 2018-11-21 23:38:54 An Italian sandwich should be dressed with olive oil and vinegar standard. Mayo should be an add-on. Unacceptable, time for a new deli.
323 2018-11-21 23:38:31 For the record, KSA supplies 11% of US oil. 
Canada supplies 40%.
324 2018-11-21 23:38:30 Ours is a president who breaks negative records everyday, hitting new lows like ExxonMobil drilling for oil.
325 2018-11-21 23:38:27 Still cleaner than fossil fuels in the long run and cheaper as well cause once the panels are made they last decades so no need for such large subsidies like oil receive. But hey I understand the technology is still early stage so why should we try right let someone else do it
326 2018-11-21 23:38:21 Did he say the word ALBERTA OIL&GAS sector once today? - or even refer to ALBERTA @ all? We aren’t asking for $$$ we r asking for action. What complete fools - $100M a day. Unbelievable. 
ENOUGH ALBERTA WE NEED TO GET OUT OF THIS SO CALLED CONFEDERATION!
327 2018-11-21 23:38:19 If the old generation of leaders wanted young people to grow up to be adults they would have nationalized the oil industry and and executed the CEOs. The next generation is already in the grave. Our future is murdering people for food. Fuck you.

330 2018-11-21 23:38:06 my roommate rubs peppermint oil on her stomach! i haven’t tried it yet tho
331 2018-11-21 23:38:02 Tell the idiots @FoxNews that 40% of US oil is from Canada...you know the country just north of the US.
332 2018-11-21 23:37:58 Same please
333 2018-11-21 23:37:55 No no no. Thank u ! The greatest crude oil trader of the decade!
334 2018-11-21 23:37:54 This court got baby oil all over it #dukevszags
335 2018-11-21 23:37:38 This is so true. It's due to the oil content of coffee beans. Once roasted, it degrades and becomes bitter and sour. 
Same way the heated oil becomes unpalatable much faster than unheated one.
336 2018-11-21 23:37:28 i like oil only but NEVER MAYO
337 2018-11-21 23:37:27 Honestly?, you would rather see Saudi Arabia, counter with oil prices so high that you would pay 5.00 or more at the pump with everything that would do to our economy? Food prices etc. If Trump took a hard line on the Saudis, you would be screaming in a week, right before X mas.
338 2018-11-21 23:37:27 Asking for justice is deserved, but here stands the hyprocisy. Before this, where was the political outcry against the "Kingdom"  who consistently ranks among the "worst of the worst" in Freedom House's annual survey of political & civil rights? A: blind, deaf & dumb. $$oil$$guns
339 2018-11-21 23:37:20 Thre is little desirable about these Sitka Spruce landscapes - so dark and thickly planted.  Remind me of Palm Oil plantations that have destroyed rich habitats in the far east - largely barren ecosystems.  The felling also reminds me of a 1st world battlefield - carnage.

344 2018-11-21 23:36:54 Bought out by oil interests. Look at who buys his product. Energy futures markets rely on forecasts. Need to look at who underwrites these forecasters when evaluating their opinions.
345 2018-11-21 23:36:42 Has anyone theorized #KhashoggiMurder was a frame to halt the weapons deal, destabilize U.S.-Saudi relations, destabilize MidEast, weapon against @realDonaldTrump Admin. oil prices? Iran? Yemen? @TulsiGabbard @LindseyGrahamSC @seanhannity @RealJamesWoods @marklevinshow @SebGorka
346 2018-11-21 23:36:41 Girl that’s exactly how i feel! Having stained lids and one sad little lonely bump on her lid didn’t call for her disrespectful, disgusting rant . If she knew about makeup like she SAYS she does, she would’ve known to try oil based remover next 
347 2018-11-21 23:36:31 has anyone showed @realDonaldTrump that it is in fact CANADA that supplies 40% of the oil to the us?! Where the fudgesicles is our damn thank you?! @NancyLeeGrahn  wonder if @piersmorgan can fact check that stat brought to him by a knowledgeable female... *shakes head*
348 2018-11-21 23:36:30 I would gladly see higher oil prices over you as president.
349 2018-11-21 23:36:27 You had me until you added mayonnaise (egg yolks and oil), which debunked the no-egg and no-butter cake. Sorry.
350 2018-11-21 23:36:21 The past 4 years I’ve gone through endless different therapies and counseling for my depression and anxiety and have gotten no where with my mental health,the past 2 weeks I’ve been taking CBD oil and I have noticed a difference with my sleeping and getting up every morning
351 2018-11-21 23:36:20 2) 9/11 was amazing for the US/UK/Israel/Saudi Military Industrial Complex.  Look at all of the destruction, power, gold, gas pipelines, oil, natural resources, opium, etc. that they grabbed!
352 2018-11-21 23:36:16 Castor oil and Facetune
353 2018-11-21 23:36:11 Robert Ehrlich came to my college in 1979 to tell us that by 200 we were all going to run out of food & oil while freezing
354 2018-11-21 23:36:09 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
355 2018-11-21 23:36:06 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
356 2018-11-21 23:36:00 When you already need an oil change, new tires, and a transmission fluid flush and then your brakes start squeaking 
357 2018-11-21 23:35:52 Relaxing bank regs, ignoring school shootings,using land from national parks for drilling for oil,etc. The economy where stocks and investments,and retirement plans r tied to the stock market.Stocks losing all gains.Maybe I’m the only one bothered. Could be.
358 2018-11-21 23:35:47 We shall boil the infidel defilers alive in cauldrons of coconut oil.
359 2018-11-21 23:35:44 meanwhile you get most of the oil from Canada why the hell don't you people call him out on all his lies
360 2018-11-21 23:35:34 When Trump speak about Oil, technical analysis stops. Trump said we need more down. That's what gonna happen... See you in $45
361 2018-11-21 23:35:33 It does though. When oil is below 60 per barrel many of these southern economies hurt.
362 2018-11-21 23:35:24 40% of the oil imported by the USA comes from Canada and 10% comes from Saudi Arabia, yet Trump is more critical of Canada. I wonder why that is? Could it be because the Saudis have spent so much money at Trump properties?
363 2018-11-21 23:35:24 I’d rather not even buy that  there’s a link to oil prices in his obsequiousness to Sauds. Condos, loans, laundries...maybe. USA gets <10% of oil imports from Saud. 40% from Canada, which he shits on. It’s about him. Thats all.
364 2018-11-21 23:35:20 this is an oil painting
365 2018-11-21 23:35:14 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund and the people who control the National Enquirer. They have a stated mandate to support the oil companies and have been actively working to introduce US style conservatism to Canada. They are not a news outlet, they are propagandists
366 2018-11-21 23:35:09 Oil and vinegar imho
367 2018-11-21 23:35:03 just a drop of cooking oil should do the trick!
368 2018-11-21 23:34:57 The oil and gas sector is brutal, all Trudeau cares about is the east
369 2018-11-21 23:34:48 Donnie Boy, we get 40% of our oil from Canada.  We get only 9% from Saudi Arabia.  I think you should be thanking Canada.  Poor man, is so freaking confused.
370 2018-11-21 23:34:47 Next time I go get my oil changed I'm taking my dad. I feel like I got cheated out my money lmao
371 2018-11-21 23:34:43 As I said, its better than showing up with a news crew and pretending to volunteer by washing dishes that had already been clean. 
Yea. Keep drinking that kool aid son 
372 2018-11-21 23:34:38 If we stop trading Saudi Arabia the oil price goes up? How is that bad. I live in Alberta, our economy booms when oil prices are high.  #TYTLIVE
373 2018-11-21 23:34:38 In other words:  Screw you US oil producers!
374 2018-11-21 23:34:31 You let someone off for torture and murder, the least they can do is lower oil prices.
#resist
375 2018-11-21 23:34:26 Saudi Arabia can do whatever it wants. It is the country that provides us oil.
376 2018-11-21 23:34:22 How can Trump give the Saudi’s credit for the low gas prices in certain areas, when we only buy about 11% of our oil from them? Majority of our oil comes from Canada! I say certain areas, because it’s certainly not low in PA yet
377 2018-11-21 23:34:22 Only 11% of our oil is imported from Saudi Arabia so....
378 2018-11-21 23:34:13 Until the price of oil dropped. That's like refinancing an ARM to build a McMansion because you've been getting overtime for 2 years now.
379 2018-11-21 23:34:12 Unless you give us a break on oil, then feel free to kill anyone you want? Extra points if it's a journalist.

385 2018-11-21 23:33:52 Thing is, Trump's snake oil salesman tactics work on some, apparently. It is not presidential, he has lowered the bar to the ground. It's all cool and all if he wants to be a wheeler dealer, on his own dime.
386 2018-11-21 23:33:51 2) 9/11 was amazing for the US/UK/Israel/Saudi Military Industrial Complex.  Look at all of the destruction, power, gold, gas pipelines, oil, natural resources, opium, etc. that they grabbed!
387 2018-11-21 23:33:48 Mau rice bran oil 
388 2018-11-21 23:33:46 Except the USA got no oil out of the Iraq War. China, which opposed the war, was the biggest foreign beneficiary of what became Iraq's booming oil business industry following the end of the war.
389 2018-11-21 23:33:41 sana oil hahaha
390 2018-11-21 23:33:39 Can we talk about how absurd it is to use global oil price as the measure of POTUS?
Or how ridiculous it is that US keeps itself reliant on the fuel that is killing our environment?
391 2018-11-21 23:33:39 Quit fucking lying Mikey. This was not a tanker spill. It was a faulty valve on a supply line at the well head on the ocean floor. And according to the experts reports all of the oil evaporated naturally. The area is being monitored.  #mikehudemasaliar
392 2018-11-21 23:33:36 @hubblecontacts You are a FRAUD. If I don’t get my $36 back, I am going to report you to the @US_FDA as a charlatan organization.  Your lenses are nothing but snake oil.
393 2018-11-21 23:33:27 Also he’s says “they’ve kept oil prices low” hasn’t he on multiple occasions tweeted about OPEC and how they are being unfair on prices....aka the prices were TOO HIGH #tytlive #SaudiArabia
394 2018-11-21 23:33:24 Dr. We had follow your works and look at the daily reports are not giving any short signal for crude oil, but only sell signal. Yesturday was showing your research already short crude since 75 top...little confused.
395 2018-11-21 23:33:22 Oil gluts aren't caused by governments or consumers, they're caused by poor management of big companies trying to bleed a province dry.
396 2018-11-21 23:33:15 The best thing about going to @jiffylube in the middle of the day ona weekday is that there are 7 people changing the oil. #reallyfast
397 2018-11-21 23:33:10 Did trump seriously just thank Saudis Arabia for low oil prices?  Talk about tacky!!
398 2018-11-21 23:33:09 Exxon Mobile can make money while shipping and refining Middle Eastern Oil,  Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Total all of them - we import 40% of the oil we import from Canada just 9% from Saudi Arabia - did trump thank Canada?
399 2018-11-21 23:33:03 Incorrect.

But hey, people that don’t know anything about history and worship in the cult of Trump don’t know any better. Hell, to them, you count as someone who “knows history”!

Reality: you’re a charlatan selling good vibes snake oil to the #maga cult of personality.
400 2018-11-21 23:32:59 It sucks but unless you travel horse back we need the oil.
401 2018-11-21 23:32:52 We're no longer need to rely on them for oil so what's Trump's reason for kissing their ass???
402 2018-11-21 23:32:44 I like mayo (not sorry), but who the fuck puts mayo on an ITALIAN. Mustard and oil. This is not hard.
403 2018-11-21 23:32:44 CBD oil might help her. I don’t know much about it but I e heard good things.
404 2018-11-21 23:32:38 I get my rosehip oil from the ordinary and it transformed my skin. I’m super dry in the winter but using this every day makes my skin feel great!!
405 2018-11-21 23:32:35 I want my oil changed for xmas
406 2018-11-21 23:32:33 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
407 2018-11-21 23:32:32 Azerbaijan is the most corrupt country in the world, headed by Aliyev clan and his cronies, fattening themselves with billions of dollars from oil income, while its citizens are being oppressed and anyone questioning Aliyev is thrown into jail or disappears.A Sad circus!
408 2018-11-21 23:32:31 Hey America, most of your oil comes from Canada..
409 2018-11-21 23:32:29 Won’t lower oil prices slow down American oil production?
410 2018-11-21 23:32:29 Hahahahahahaha ayaw mabulgar
411 2018-11-21 23:32:27 Lol.... there are still coal and oil and gas based power centres that generate electricity.
412 2018-11-21 23:32:23 my website for the for the hemp oil I am a distributor. We have a group website of the many people they have helped. Thought you might be interested.
413 2018-11-21 23:32:23 a strategy can now be that you only get inland cities and just burn every bit of coal and oil you can find to make sea levels rise but they also added the world congress and climate accords and the like into the game to try to prevent you from being a total asshole
414 2018-11-21 23:32:21 The most of the oil imported to the US apparently comes from Canada. Have no fear we don't kill journalists. Mosquitos yes. Journalists no.
415 2018-11-21 23:32:02 You know when oil was higher it was stick bumps. Now that stocks are down, it is cheap gas. Pick a random measure, something is always in the good. Shit-shining as shineola.
416 2018-11-21 23:31:57 I guess it's better than going there with a news crew and pretending to volunteer by washing clean plates. 
Yea. That's ok though. 
Republicans. They are amusing.
417 2018-11-21 23:31:45 Jamal #Khashoggi life to this President is worth less than a barrel of oil. Let sink in.
418 2018-11-21 23:31:42 You do realize that coal and oil are subsidized already, aren’t we better off using that money to create technologies that help reduce Emissions and improve our energy infrastructure. Not that I expect a reply from a troll account.
419 2018-11-21 23:31:41 US. Produces almost 40%of their own oil the rest comes from Canada 40% Venezuela, Africa. Saudi oil is like 10 or 11% he makes it sound like he's done you a big favour
420 2018-11-21 23:31:40 I just wore a thong and walked around dc all day. 10/10 would not recommend. is it okay to put coconut oil on your vagina? asking for a friend.
421 2018-11-21 23:31:29 lol called @NTB and asked if i’d ever get my car back and they said they were about to pull it in right now. i go over there and it’s still sitting in the spot i parked it in. 8 HOURS LATER FOR AN OIL CHANGE. fucking neanderthals working over there.
422 2018-11-21 23:31:28 Now adjust the pump price accordingly and stop the rip off on the american people.i venture to say that the last time oil was $50-$60 per barrell,a gallon of regular was $1.00....
423 2018-11-21 23:31:23 Canada supplies most of our oil idiot, thank them. Of course it's really about you.
424 2018-11-21 23:31:21 If Piers Morgan were more relevant, he would be Larry King.  Not Larry King on CNN twenty years ago, Larry King now hawking fish oil on infomercials.
425 2018-11-21 23:31:21 So Saudi Arabia controls the world’s price of oil now? Give me a break...
426 2018-11-21 23:31:18 You can’t slicc a can of oil.
427 2018-11-21 23:31:15 Screw the oil and the jobs! We are not for sale!
428 2018-11-21 23:31:11 In mr. trump’s Highly articulate and complex analysis of oil prices:

higher prices = BAD   
(I am not responsible, blame someone else)

lower prices  = GOOD
(I must have done something to make this happen)
429 2018-11-21 23:31:09 So he had to conflate numbers in oil...to praise the murderous #Saudi regime! The hoops this guy will go through to protect MONEY! Money over people! money over morals! MONEY over America  #tytlive #oil
430 2018-11-21 23:31:05 my mama sitting here throwing hints that she needs more oil and i’m letting each one go over my head 
431 2018-11-21 23:30:54 Today he did nothing for the Oil & Gas industry.
432 2018-11-21 23:30:46 You may sell your sole for cheep oil, but don't sell out America by ignoring the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, an American and journalist.  
#Khashoggi
#CrownPrince must be charged
433 2018-11-21 23:30:45 Usually a v dry skin girl, but today I’ve produced enough oil to cook a whole plate of spring rolls
434 2018-11-21 23:30:43 #tytlive oil prices, it only cost the country what's left of it's integrity and credibility.
435 2018-11-21 23:30:33 Where is all this cheap oil? 3 years ago it was just a little over 2 bucks in Jersey. #tytlive
436 2018-11-21 23:30:31 beanie + wet hair + a lil tiny but if botanical oil = my hair looking good
437 2018-11-21 23:30:28 Look at you celebrating the punch in the gut to the US oil producers.

440 2018-11-21 23:30:16 How to get away with murder: be a ruler of a country sitting on tons of oil #SaudiArabia #Venezuela
441 2018-11-21 23:30:12 Cbd oil right? I haven’t looked into but I will! Do u use it? Does it help?
442 2018-11-21 23:30:04 Who could've burned all this oil! Gee what should we do? I'll keep pumping oil just in case burning more of it is the solution.
443 2018-11-21 23:29:56 I accidentally pumped gas at the BP Oil station. I pulled in without thinking. I will never give more than the $6.75 I just accidentally paid. I’ll fill my tank elsewhere.
444 2018-11-21 23:29:54 Hahaha oo yung isa nga denial pa
445 2018-11-21 23:29:53 But out oil prices are low.
446 2018-11-21 23:29:50 It’s $3.09 here. I’d pay $4/g if it meant no more Saudi oil.
447 2018-11-21 23:29:49 3 day week was the result of the oil crisis.

Winter of discontent was triggered by austerity measures insisted upon by IMF.
448 2018-11-21 23:29:49 He'd kill for lower oil prices.
449 2018-11-21 23:29:48 #KashoggiCoverUp for oil, weapons and Trump private businesses !
450 2018-11-21 23:29:46 Cook that shit in oil
451 2018-11-21 23:29:27 Hint: It's not about the oil.
452 2018-11-21 23:29:26 Make no mistake he should be criticized for this but let's not pretend it would so simple to condemn the vicious prince. There would be fallout & no one wants a repeat of the oil crisis of the 70s either if that should be a risk.
453 2018-11-21 23:29:26 Got home in Houston and was immediately told to leave and get oil to make buñuelos. Happy thanksgiving
454 2018-11-21 23:29:25 “Avoid losing?”  Oil will be consumed so, if we stop producing, we get zero. Building pipelines and getting rid of Trudeau is the answer. If we stop selling, the US will use their own oil and then we got nothing. Thanks @JustinTrudeau
455 2018-11-21 23:29:20 Is it really ok with you that we get oil from a country that kills journalists?! Is it Johnny? IS IT?!!!!!!
456 2018-11-21 23:29:20 Not at all a fan of hydrogenated vegetable oil shortening in cooking. 

There’s a reason the places it’s sold in Europe tend to be fetish stores not food stores...
457 2018-11-21 23:29:06 PS The US gets 11% of it's Oil from Saudi Arabia and 40% from Canada.
458 2018-11-21 23:29:04 Once again Trump reveals his total lack of morals. Thanking Saudis for lower oil prices ($$$) but ignoring horrific murder/dismemberment of journalist Khashoggi (human life). WTF!
459 2018-11-21 23:29:03 Congratulations to Doug Ford and Friends: their hard work and influence have resulted in lower gas prices resulting from their reducing the world-wide price of oil. Trump must stop taking credit for Doug’s hard work.
460 2018-11-21 23:29:00 Hi Liz have ever tried CBD OIL? For pain management? When I was a teen, I fractured my C3 vertebra, got really bad pain later in life,I started taking CBD , pain gone completely, no side effects,unlike the bigphama poison pills I got from my doctor! No more pills, just CBD OIL 
461 2018-11-21 23:28:55 You've seen the photos. When the rest of the world sees them you will not be forgiven, even if oil is at $5. #barbaric
462 2018-11-21 23:28:53 Wala na kase silang maisip nga gimik, di na sila mabenta sa tao
463 2018-11-21 23:28:52 What message does it send when people can be brutally murdered and that is considered OK if the price of oil falls?
464 2018-11-21 23:28:42 Mines the left arm, presently trying some CBD oil.
465 2018-11-21 23:28:41 Chavez' subsidy model assumed that oil stayed over $100/barrel, but Putin got into a price war with the US in an attempt to kill off fracking (and thus US world leading production) and Venezuela was collateral damage. Iran quite a bit as well. That time it really was the Russians
466 2018-11-21 23:28:36 just drove past the lucas oil stadium </13
467 2018-11-21 23:28:33 Ke koma kawai
468 2018-11-21 23:28:28 Hey one Muslim Brotherhood supporter dead for cheap oil ?? It’s worth it!!
469 2018-11-21 23:28:20 Except the oil companies, though. Right? #Hypocrisy
470 2018-11-21 23:28:19 #Cult45 too stupid to know low oil prices hurts US GDP and oil exports...
471 2018-11-21 23:28:13 The USA/Canada need a price of $50 a barrel to make a profit. If oil drops too much below this, the stock market will dive- not go up.
472 2018-11-21 23:28:10 OPEC controls oil prices unfortunately and Saudi Arabia is just one country among others that supply's oil to the world.  Trump is s dullard.
473 2018-11-21 23:28:08 Dear mam sara its also difficult to get job due to oil prices.
474 2018-11-21 23:28:08 Ano pa nga ba ang aasahan sa mga taong arogante at desperada, grabe di sila nahihiya, sabagay di naman natin kilala kung sino sila... kaya matapang ang mga poohtang ina
475 2018-11-21 23:28:08 @potus Mr. President, it is time to stop sucking at the teat of Saudi Arabia and end our dependence on their oil.  Once again, 15 of 19 of the 911 hijackers were Saudi nationals. The crown prince is a tyrant who murders dissidents. Why are we still in bed with these fools?
476 2018-11-21 23:28:07 わたしもパーヴェかなんかで知ったんだよなあ
477 2018-11-21 23:28:06 The CBD in it helps with a lot of physical problems but the oil tastes gross...a better way of administering it maybe...
478 2018-11-21 23:28:05 Those lower oil prices are fucking domestic oil drilling. #tytlive
479 2018-11-21 23:28:04 You are not part of the solution to the problem, you are the problem.
Stop pumping oil and gas. Leave what is left under the ground. Do this immediately. #greenwash
480 2018-11-21 23:27:58 PEPPERMINT OIL. PURR
481 2018-11-21 23:27:57 そうそうそう！！それ！！Kneelするやつ！！！！！
482 2018-11-21 23:27:48 That oil is mixed with blood to pass the savings on to you, the consumer.
483 2018-11-21 23:27:48 Quit gaslighting people!  The U.S. produces more oil than the Saudis.  The U.S. is the reason prices are lower.
484 2018-11-21 23:27:43 THERE'S JOURNALIST BLOOD IN THOSE SAUDI BARRELS OF OIL!!!

@realDonaldTrump tell us HOW MUCH OF A KICKBACK ARE YOU GETTING FROM THE SAUDIS FOR THEIR OIL???
485 2018-11-21 23:27:38 Fuck anyone that can get a $20 oil change 
486 2018-11-21 23:27:37 斑類がどうたら先祖返りが云々みたいな 理解出来てない
487 2018-11-21 23:27:36 食パンさん、おはみゃおみゃですー！
488 2018-11-21 23:27:35 Ohhh I always thought the oil has a flavor ^^
489 2018-11-21 23:27:32 I did a skin peel, used lotus oil and a face massager for like 10 solid minutes I better wake up GLOWINGGGGGGGG 
490 2018-11-21 23:27:30 Weed, cbd oil, and exercise
491 2018-11-21 23:27:27 Do you know how much oil we actually get from Saudi Arabia?
492 2018-11-21 23:27:07 You don't seem to grasp market dynamics.  Total supply = total avail barrels not what is still in the ground.  If production is cut = less barrels,  less supply.  Always demand for oil & hence price rises to reflect this,  flood market and supply increase above demand = low price
493 2018-11-21 23:27:00 or more
494 2018-11-21 23:26:59 Working next to pot, heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium. Add guanciale and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp around the edges, 7–10 minutes.
495 2018-11-21 23:26:58 Coal oil and gas receive billions in subsidies. Estimates vary from 4 to 11 billion annually.
496 2018-11-21 23:26:55 セクピスパロは未だに仕組みが理解出来てない
497 2018-11-21 23:26:55 @TheBeatWithAri Political was  never the focus of @realtrump. The US Treasury has aided and abetted $trillons being funneled to Trump Inc thru the greatest, elaborate grifting, conning, bamboozling, scheming, stealing, cheating, backstabbing, snake oil sales in US history!
498 2018-11-21 23:26:53 Low oil prices = kissing the ring of a barbaric country.  What a monster we have in the corridors of our WH.
499 2018-11-21 23:26:50 Join us to pour hot oil on their dicks 
500 2018-11-21 23:26:47 So they put a cap on Saudi Oil .

504 2018-11-21 23:26:08 Ondo produces multiple of what imo and Abia produces. And still all of them are still negligible to what the South South produces. So please stop talking about oil. Lagos also produces.
505 2018-11-21 23:26:05 I ain't know what to eat.. So I ordered me some teriyaki chicken  plus my coworker hooked me up with some girl scout cookie thc oil! Wooooo!! Sometimes I like coming  into work 
506 2018-11-21 23:25:54 I gotta go there some day. Preferably before Trump opens it up to oil and gas drilling.
507 2018-11-21 23:25:52 Awesome, and it only cost the life of one measly journalist. Maybe, if you let them kill off the rest of the WaPo staff, they'll just give you their oil for free. Then you can really brag about great you are.
508 2018-11-21 23:25:40 False flags have always been used as an excuse to bring us into wars, especially for oil.
509 2018-11-21 23:25:39 Blood for oil

and history was way way insde
511 2018-11-21 23:25:35 @realDonaldTrump If you want to thank someone for lower oil prices, Thank Canada. You know the country that supplies way more oil than the Saudis & has a leader you treat like sh-t! You cover for Saudis for your own personal gain, not for America. We should be banning Saudi oil!
512 2018-11-21 23:25:26 I have to get an oil change and I’m about 2,000 miles over due because I’m dreading it
513 2018-11-21 23:25:26 Blood for oil.
514 2018-11-21 23:25:21 The ingredients that you will need are 
3 Tbsp. kosher salt, plus more
4 oz. guanciale (salt-cured pork jowl), pancetta , or bacon
2 oz. Parmesan
4 large egg yolks
2 large eggs
Freshly ground black pepper
2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
1 lb. spaghetti, bucatini, or rigatoni
515 2018-11-21 23:25:17 I was "cool" back in the day!
516 2018-11-21 23:25:10 If this was Haiti it would be a different story.  But with all the oil Saudi’s Arabia has the leaders will get a free pass and the people who took orders will be executed to save the leaders
517 2018-11-21 23:25:09 How many murdered journalists  are we willing to accept before we talk about America values and not oil.  @presssec @KellyannePolls @flotus    And what about those 8 companies u registered in Saudia Arabia as u ran for president.  Just saying. @IvankaTrump

519 2018-11-21 23:25:02 Might be the oil capital, but if you're a business relying on UK delivery, you're penalised. @FergusEwingMSP Time to sort delivery charges to let rural businesses compete on an even playing field @ScotRuralAction
520 2018-11-21 23:25:02 No problem 
That’s only about a week and a half of lost oil revenue. 

Chickenfeed 
or chickenshit

You decide
521 2018-11-21 23:25:02 Trump: says what's deep down his very dark heart, supports KSA thru oil trade & arms sale, closes eyes to excesses. 
Other US Prezs: offer tepid, holier-than-thou criticisms, enables KSA thru oil trade & arms sales. Turns blind eye to excesses 
Me: what's the real difference?
522 2018-11-21 23:24:59 Grated sweet potato (wring out water in a cloth), finely chopped spring onion, egg yolk, tablespoon of flour, ground cumin, salt, pepper and chilli flakes. Fry gently in olive oil for a few mins till brown then bake in oven on a wire rack for about 10/15 mins till fully cooked
523 2018-11-21 23:24:57 Once again....you favour Ontario and Quebec over Alberta. You reward manufacturing and clean tech...and screw over Oil Sands.  Super divisive...very sad!
524 2018-11-21 23:24:56 Actually it's the power of OIL. U.S needs Saudi because of OIL. U.S cannot let Saudi fail/fall because of OIL. It's just a matter of time. Soon, Saudi will run out of OIL & the U.S all of sudden discovers the human rights abuses in Saudi & marches in.
525 2018-11-21 23:24:54 Out of curiosity, how much of that middle-class tax increase is due to increased wages? And what percentage of workers are now eligible for EI benefits vs. how many were eligible after your party disqualified two-thirds of Canadian workers to help pay for tax cuts for the rich?
526 2018-11-21 23:24:45 I use better oil than what you describe!
527 2018-11-21 23:24:41 And we can tell opec countries to stick their oil up their asses.  Why aren't Republicans on board? Oh yeah lobbyist
528 2018-11-21 23:24:40 You truly have to be delusional if you believe this country is now doing bad pick up the Wall Street Journal unemployment and all time low for women Hispanics and blacks consumer sentiment is the highest it's been in a very long time consumer spending up oil prices are down
529 2018-11-21 23:24:39 SA is the largest producer of world oil. It's production covers almost 13% of the world demand. If SA decides to cut production; almost 20% of world economy will come to complete halt. Other sources of energy can not cover this huge of loss.

531 2018-11-21 23:24:28 Don’t leave the houtties in power when the Russian are in Ethiopia as they will the control all oil shipping
Routes to Europe
532 2018-11-21 23:24:27 So our environment minister opposes oil, pork and beef.  Industries that used to employ thousands of Albertans.  
How precious.
533 2018-11-21 23:24:27 I wonder if Justin knows about the Saudis hatred for Jews, Christians, gays? Can Justin be bought? Bloody Saudi oil is better than Alberta oil, isn’t it? Canada could be self sufficient oil but that might mean building a pipeline. That would kill Butts master plan to kill Alberta
534 2018-11-21 23:24:24 I refuse to bake with oil, so I substitute butter in all recipes. Not melted butter, softened butter. Results: deliciousness.
535 2018-11-21 23:24:20 It’s all because of the oil, plain and simple
536 2018-11-21 23:24:18 I’d like to thank Jake for being my stand-in boyfriend and calling the oil change place to yell at the guy for being a creepy unprofessional dingus
537 2018-11-21 23:24:15 No, it has stopped you from claiming that you have ever been anything but a snake oil salesman who takes the money and runs.
538 2018-11-21 23:24:14 Also ...... Canada sells America 4 times more oil that Saudis. If you’re going to thank anyone....
539 2018-11-21 23:24:13 Not those of us the oil industry f'ed over
540 2018-11-21 23:24:11 Gotta love when you go in for an oil change and all of a sudden the mechanic has your dumb ass convinced the car will fall apart on the way home if you don’t cough up $1637
541 2018-11-21 23:24:10 Hahaha. Oil & gas? Not for long sunshine.
542 2018-11-21 23:24:10 Don't forget to thank Canada for lowering our oil prices. We only buy 10% of our oil from the Saudis, but we buy 40% from the Canadians. THANK YOU CANADA from the President of the United States. That's how you do it, in case you didn't know.
543 2018-11-21 23:24:08 So kill someone else and oil prices will go lower. Is the drop in prices a coincidence? Or a gift for you letting a murderer off the h
544 2018-11-21 23:24:07 Dom/Subユニバースは最高なんです……………
545 2018-11-21 23:24:07 Let’s just shut them down. Then oil prices shoot up to $150 a barrel in a week and your constituency can’t pay for gasoline. Nice idea idiot.
546 2018-11-21 23:24:06 I agree get it flushed. And might want to make sure you dont have a cracked head. Does the oil look ok?
547 2018-11-21 23:24:03 Obama showed up at a good bank with a film crew & flash photog - worked the line - then distributed the footage to all media outlets? But you say it's all becuz hes helping out?  There's nothing in it for him?  Really?
548 2018-11-21 23:23:58 Trump turning a blind eye to suffering of thousands for some cheap oil, shame on you.
549 2018-11-21 23:23:58 It's not about the low price of oil, it's about standing by and accepting the human rights violations of the Saudis.
550 2018-11-21 23:23:54 ay pota sana oil
551 2018-11-21 23:23:50 Italy goes without a functioning government at least one quarter of every year but I’m “lying” when I say they spend an inordinate amount of time loafing, talking loudly with their hands, and drizzling everything with olive oil lol
552 2018-11-21 23:23:42 Olive oil is basically the devil's lube.
553 2018-11-21 23:23:31 11% of our oil comes from Saudi.
554 2018-11-21 23:23:29 World Cup should be kept in the summer for counties capable of hosting it.

Not looking forward to seeing the domestic season ruined. It's bad enough we have to many International breaks already. 

Amazing what oil money can buy.
555 2018-11-21 23:23:28 Trump celebrates blood money by thanking Saudi Arabia for low oil prices.
556 2018-11-21 23:23:26 Does your island have an address? I want to send you some beard oil to try out on your goatee.
557 2018-11-21 23:23:24 That is why Trump gave eight nations at least a temporary pass so they can continue to buy oil from Iran.  As for the Saudi leverage...the oil fields going on line in Texas will be able to offset whatever the Saudi's supply...they will have no leverage.
558 2018-11-21 23:23:20 If we switched to renewables and cut the need for oil, therefore cutting the 40% of oil Canada supplies the US, maybe then trumpers would wake up. Or am I asked too much?
559 2018-11-21 23:23:17 @S_tantan1122 さおりさんおめでとう～～
560 2018-11-21 23:23:11 1. Wahhabism fundamentalist Islam is an export from Saudi.
2. Saudi nationals killed the twin towers. King killed dissenting free press.
3. Iran is the enemy because Saudi says so.
4. What if Iran spread the oil $ instead of the Saudis?
5. Saudi’s bailed out Trump  personally.
561 2018-11-21 23:23:10 Who got them thc oil 90% and higher only
562 2018-11-21 23:23:05 OK fill my oil tank for free.
563 2018-11-21 23:23:03 A thought occurs...

5 of the 15 people that murdered Khashoggi are being tried with the death penalty..

If SA follows through, it will actually be the blood of SIX people in exchange for an arms deal and cheaper oil...
564 2018-11-21 23:23:00 Sorry bruv but If he had floated the naira then, you would have ended up in a refugee camp. The dollar was bound to go up, nothing would have stopped it. All countries dependent on oil had to devalue their currency.
565 2018-11-21 23:23:00 Wow, you really, really schooled him
566 2018-11-21 23:22:44 Besides oil and being somewhat of an ally why is our govt defending Saudi Arabia rn? Fr, what they did is absolutely disgusting and should have consequences
567 2018-11-21 23:22:44 Can I ask a question of you libs?  What do you want #Trump to do with #SaudiArabia ?  Break off relations?  See oil prices skyrocket?  Cut off military supplies?  See #Russia and #China take our place ?  See #Americans suffer with much higher energy bills?  Then blame Trump? Yes.
568 2018-11-21 23:22:42 What? The federal government arrived in power AFTER the oil price downturn of mid-2014. What did the Conservatives do? They botched Northern Gateway and, as for EE, TCP decided to put its chips on KXL, which is still hung up in the American courts.
569 2018-11-21 23:22:42 Praising for low oil prices in one thing but praise Saudie Arabia 
570 2018-11-21 23:22:30 @realDonaldTrump   I have a better idea.  Instead of giving us cheap oil, have Saudi Arabia just take Donald Trump!  Way better deal for us!
571 2018-11-21 23:22:28 Tamed by hemp oil under the tongue..
572 2018-11-21 23:22:27 Easy to do. I use an oil less fryer
573 2018-11-21 23:22:27 Coconut oil at bed time just wear long sleeves and pants lol
574 2018-11-21 23:22:25 Trump is now responsible for breaking up families & caging kids on the southern border, complicit with the ongoing genocide in Yemen, complicit with the premeditated murder of a WP journalist in Turkey and a low life pusher feeding America’s addiction to oil, foreign & domestic .
575 2018-11-21 23:22:20 Canada supplies 4x the oil that Saudi Arabia does. You pinch off Saudi supplies, stand up for human rights. Trump is a weasel.
576 2018-11-21 23:22:19 And because of Trudeau and his clown posse we can't get our oil to the USA !!
577 2018-11-21 23:22:17 There a lot of criminals and killers in Saudi Arabia, but u r weak on that front, do they have you over a barrel of oil???!
578 2018-11-21 23:22:17 That’s a great deal considering the frying oil costs about $40.
579 2018-11-21 23:22:09 Trump is pushing the price of oil lower. So why did you campaign for him? Did you not realize that he would hurt Alberta, or did you not care, Devin Dreeshan?
#ableg #abpoli
580 2018-11-21 23:22:08 Canada supplies nearly 40% of U.S. oil.  Saudi Arabia 11%.  Also Canadians have not murdered journalists, and Canadians didn't fly planes into buildings on 9/11.
581 2018-11-21 23:22:01 Didn’t I read we only get 12% of our oil from them, so even oil has nothing to do with it.
582 2018-11-21 23:21:58 Thank you for the lower oil prices Jamal Khashoggi.
583 2018-11-21 23:21:56 Kahit oil diffuser lang matanggap ko sa pasko masaya na ako. HAHAHA #titomode
584 2018-11-21 23:21:53 The USA only gets 11% of its oil from SA.
585 2018-11-21 23:21:46 Ask Bush...who got us into the war in Afghanistan ( which is still going) and Iraq.  If Trump would have simply continued with the Iran agreement there wasn't any issue with oil.  It is Iran not being able to sell it that would push up the price.
586 2018-11-21 23:21:43 Castor oil
587 2018-11-21 23:21:43 All day!! Ivan just likes drinking the oil out the basket after his wings and trash fries.

589 2018-11-21 23:21:36 By the time I was in my teens would fly to Damascus in the holidays as my dad worked oil crews on the Euphrates on the Turkish border then return to my school off the Malone Road & sectarian chaos...
590 2018-11-21 23:21:36 Except Oil Producing States (aka, Red States) get killed along the way.
591 2018-11-21 23:21:32 So, you traded a journalist's life for oil prices? Not a good deal for a man who claims to be a master deal-maker.
592 2018-11-21 23:21:29 Try rubbing coconut oil on your face before you go to bed. I had a buddy who couldn’t grow facial hair do that and it grew in so thick! 
593 2018-11-21 23:21:26 Volunteered... with a News Crew in tow. ..  HA!!   totally optics, nothing more, nothing less...  He hates America and honestly believes we are beneath him.... So there's some 'schooling' for ya, big dawg.
594 2018-11-21 23:21:22 Blood money/oil
595 2018-11-21 23:21:22 Blind defense of these institutions erodes public confidence even further than just telling the truth.
596 2018-11-21 23:21:20 Organic Coconut oil overnight let it be. 
597 2018-11-21 23:21:16 You can recommend some beard oil and conditioner. Ion got hair to drop money on shampoo like that lol
598 2018-11-21 23:21:12 So much for Aberdeen being the Oil capital of Europe 
599 2018-11-21 23:21:05 Scotland has oil and gas. England.... not so much.
600 2018-11-21 23:21:03 Been there done that.   Try Tumeric/  Curcermin w black pepper extract capsules.    OTC n a miracle for me and my doggie.   Also Magnesium Oil Spray.    ACL / Meniscus repair and many years of punishing activities.    Good luck!
601 2018-11-21 23:21:00 I love his glove! I love his puck handling.
602 2018-11-21 23:20:51 や、真面目な話なんでどむさぶがこんなにも知られてないの謎 なんで？知れよ
603 2018-11-21 23:20:51 Stop depending on oil! We should be world leaders in clean energy. Oh wait, that won’t line your greedy pockets. Thanks for being the least American “President” we’ve ever had. Loser.
604 2018-11-21 23:20:45 Too bad it requires selling our souls. I’d rather pay the higher prices. Hey, maybe we can concentrate on alternative energy so we aren’t beholden to oil rich countries.
605 2018-11-21 23:20:43 The oil in Omega 3 capsules taste like silky sorrow and suffering.

610 2018-11-21 23:20:32 Water based spray with castor oil and coconut oil.
611 2018-11-21 23:20:23 President OBAMA had gas prices $1 a gallon less consistently. How do you figure Saudi Arabia's 9% of oil we buy lowered the prices? Huh huh?
612 2018-11-21 23:20:21 Okay, we'll sanction the Saudis, oil prices will shoot up, and 320 million Americans will pay $1.00 or more per gallon at the pump just so you can feel better about one Muslim thug being killed by other Muslim thugs in the Middle East.
613 2018-11-21 23:20:15 Trades a human life for a 54.00 barrel of oil

616 2018-11-21 23:19:56 He's not taking in his RDA of Codliver oil and orange juice 
617 2018-11-21 23:19:52 Here’s an idea, let’s invest in solar and wind, hybrid and electric cars, less plastics. Lessen our overall dependence on oil and help our  environment while we’re at it.
618 2018-11-21 23:19:48 Some company just got motor oil and tortillas.
619 2018-11-21 23:19:48 Even in cold you still perspire and secrete oil enough for bacteria to eat and make smell

Especially in warm areas like balls and feet
620 2018-11-21 23:19:44 Flayo cualquiera el loco de la oil. Pero mucho
621 2018-11-21 23:19:40 Donald Trump has just tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to 'a big Tax Cut for America and the World!' In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia. CBC
622 2018-11-21 23:19:38 We still use oil and switching America to LNG is not in the books. Lol they say it will cost to much to convert. But how many billionaires toes would be stepped on. LNG cheaper cleaner why switch lol. China doesn't depend on us its Africa is where their investment is.
623 2018-11-21 23:19:38 Plot twist; it's groundnut oil.
624 2018-11-21 23:19:30 Alexa, what was the price of Oil before trump was president....did it really fall to below $30 when Obama was President?
625 2018-11-21 23:19:30 cold shower everyday

626 2018-11-21 23:19:29 He is even stupid about making money..no US oil company wants cheap oil..cuts into their profits
627 2018-11-21 23:19:23 Lower oil prices cuts my income. Thanks for nothing! Only thinking of yourself again.
628 2018-11-21 23:19:23 @glen_macgregor says oil at $50 / barrel Guessing @CTV clowns don't know AB oil trading in the $12-15 range Pathetic twisting of facts #FakeNewsCTV

631 2018-11-21 23:18:53 Based upon this article it supports the need for 3rd world to benefit from coal, gas and oil. This will in part protect trees etc. to continue the carbon cycle. Lifting the 3rd world out of poverty by giving them access to cheap fossel fuels will help
632 2018-11-21 23:18:49 What’s bothering me is a) the flat out lie but I’m used to those and b) he said he’d punish SA if they we’re involved with the killing of the journalist. Now it’s been proven and he’s over here thanking them for cheap oil.
633 2018-11-21 23:18:46 The last time the prices went that low, didn’t a lot of people get laid off in the oil/energy businesses?  Or has my memory gone bad on This?
634 2018-11-21 23:18:44 Will: Libs blame everything on Trump but hold Obama accountable for zero. Being liberal means never having to play by your own rules.
635 2018-11-21 23:18:44 Note to Gabbard: Trump's concern is keeping oil prices low for the American people, not worrying about which overseas thugs killed another overseas thug. Grow up. Nasty people get killed by nasty people around the world every day.
636 2018-11-21 23:18:37 Worse then that. We are getting $13-$14/BBL for our Oil that has $15/BBL of diluent in it!
637 2018-11-21 23:18:17 Oil and coal merchants incapable of truth
638 2018-11-21 23:18:12 Yes, Mr. President, Thanks for giving us another backdoor tax cut in spite of the tax-hiking, overspending, incoming Democrats!  Lower oil prices put more cash in everybody’s pocket, just in time for Christmas!
639 2018-11-21 23:18:11 Lots & L O T S of reading today, that guy that's sounds like a brand of olive oil, the life of artists, then Winkleman, which I never spell correctly, & then another beginning with F? Obliterated still life but somehow ignored by the Dutch (did they get a free pass?)MY EYES!!!
640 2018-11-21 23:18:07 You know you get about 10% of your oil from SA et about 40% from Canada?
641 2018-11-21 23:18:04 he also looks like he took an olive oil shower
642 2018-11-21 23:18:01 If your Tupperware doesn't have oil stains on it, I'm withdrawing my invitation for tomorrow
643 2018-11-21 23:17:57 He cares about cheap oil because he has a vague idea that high oil prices is politically bad for the president. He’s not wrong, but he thinks Saudi Arabia has way more power now than they actually do.
644 2018-11-21 23:17:45 OIL
645 2018-11-21 23:17:38 @JustinTrudeau @liberal_party don't care. This was the plan all along remember & I quote: We will face out the oil sands.
646 2018-11-21 23:17:38 can i get a nut free beard oil?
647 2018-11-21 23:17:30 We all like the lower oil prices, IF trump stays in office the Saudis are going to want that money back, and with his son in law in their back pocket and his  Legiance to the prince, prices will go way up!!
648 2018-11-21 23:17:29 Took my 40+ years to realize my body needs dietary changes in wintertime. Winter skin and a rebout of eczema can be more than just bad skin, it can be "god doesn't love you". Krill oil, omega3s, eat more salmon, almonds, and RUN towards magnesium! #ymmv (Not a doc, just caring)
649 2018-11-21 23:17:25 Can it ever be anything other than money and oil regarding Trump! Truly outrageous!
650 2018-11-21 23:17:23 I am not even sure if we even Saudi oil anymore
651 2018-11-21 23:17:21 I will not help destroy an entire animal specie and his environment because of a cookie. I will not buy your product has long has it has palm oil, The same thing goes for other products.
652 2018-11-21 23:17:21 Funny thing is that most Americans don’t realize that the US produces lots of oil, we export it. We could be independent of any nations oil, but our oil companies are making bigger profits exporting.
653 2018-11-21 23:17:19 I’m about to flip my shit if one more person comes in for an oil change tonight...
654 2018-11-21 23:17:18 You know as well or better than most that the global dominance of the USA depends on Saudi Arabia agreeing not to sell for anything other than dollars. They got us by the gonads and you know it! All the king has to do is begin to accept Euros or Yuan for oil. #PerpetualCkeckMate
655 2018-11-21 23:17:15 @potus thank Canada which supplies 40% of the oil we use. Canada. Yes, Canada - do your homework - SA - 11% @vp @senatemajldr @senategop @housegop @senatedems @housedems

658 2018-11-21 23:16:56 Sweet, of course I have an oil leak in my car. Like I needed to deal with any more shit, especially with my car 
659 2018-11-21 23:16:56 I'll trade my lowered gas/oil priced for morals. How you could not only condone the slaughtering (in an embacy) but then to sell these animals weapons is beyond me. You are in bed with Satin for money. If your child was chopped in to pieces would you still sell America's soul?
660 2018-11-21 23:16:51 a weed shop in my down is having a black friday sale w $1 grams of flower, $1 edibles, and $5 grams of oil WHAT THE FUCKKKKKKK
661 2018-11-21 23:16:47 Hey Wayne, now Ima school you: if Obama thinks America is racist, angry and filled with hate, guess who was POTUS for 8 years until 2017? Winner, winner, turkey dinner!!! You built that, Obama!
662 2018-11-21 23:16:44 it’s amazing what a bit of essential oil can do for ur scalp
663 2018-11-21 23:16:40 Oil and gas prices were actually MUCH lower when Obama left office.
664 2018-11-21 23:16:34 These are the words of a scared and desperate man. You suck up to the rich and powerful leaders of the world and attack those who keep you in check. You even took credit for lower oil prices but it has nothing to do with you. You are a sorry individual.
665 2018-11-21 23:16:34 Wait. So making the libs heads explode means saying what lib professors say, namely “make again” means “leave completely unaltered” and “great” means “big oil’s bitch.” Did we have to teach it to you again in some kind of class play form where you act it out?!?
666 2018-11-21 23:16:27 Under tribalism. The concept of individual ownership, buying and selling, no. 
But if a tribes population grew to demand more resources, the obvious solution is to attack your neighbors and drive them out.
667 2018-11-21 23:16:24 Palm oil no no no no!
668 2018-11-21 23:16:18 A glut of oil has nothing to do with trump !
669 2018-11-21 23:16:13 I prefer mine in strips fried in olive oil Xx
670 2018-11-21 23:16:07 Perfect example of why no 1 trust the Media! People know everything is manipulated or lies & MSM Parrot It like little Puppets! But @realDonaldTrump makes a overall truthful statement “Cheap Oil huge 4 People”  & MSM finds a pointless # off & miss the whole meaning! What Fools!
671 2018-11-21 23:16:03 Omg i did the laundry and there’s castor oil stains on my white t shirts
672 2018-11-21 23:16:01 I just read CBC report that says USA gets 40% oil/gas from CANADA, only 11% from Saudi Arabia.  Makes me wonder why Trump is gushing over Saudi Arabia's contribution.  He continues to demean CANADA even though we supply almost half of your fuel supply????
673 2018-11-21 23:15:58  PSA: grease fires are very dangerous!!! This thanksgiving be sure to be safe and keep a bucket of water on standby in case your oil catches on fire when you’re cooking!! Happy Holidays 
674 2018-11-21 23:15:53 So there is this oil-drilling platform in the Gulf that has been leaking oil for 14 years.  They've been ordered to clean it up and they said, "If we could, don't you think we would have by now?"  Feel reassured?
675 2018-11-21 23:15:46 Canada supplies 40% of your oil, Saudi Arabia supplies 11%
676 2018-11-21 23:15:45 Gee! Maybe you @realDonaldTrump should thank Canada they supply U.S.A. 4times the amount of oil than your friends in Saudi Arabia
677 2018-11-21 23:15:41 He’s being seduced.... seduced by their money. For his own personal gain ... not to the benefit of the USA by the way... To the point that he even praised them for lowering the oil price... even though the USA as an oil exporter is now losing money as a result.. he is clueless!!!
678 2018-11-21 23:15:37 Do you have oil, too?
679 2018-11-21 23:15:35 The Saudis butchered a lovely journalist and @realDonaldTrump is thanking them for oil prices. This man breastfeeds from the devil’s teat.

683 2018-11-21 23:15:23 Dear President Trump,with all the agencies under your authority,tell us whether the crown prince was directly involved in the assasination.Yes or no? Second,the most important product for the US economy is the values of human rights and not the oil.

684 2018-11-21 23:15:23 We care more about oil prices than a al-Qeda supporting Trump bashing journalist.
685 2018-11-21 23:15:21 I beg to differ. I doubt The angry orange's central motivation was cheaper oil for America...his motivations have always been more personal.
686 2018-11-21 23:15:17 They have oil money.  Royal Dutch Shell money
687 2018-11-21 23:15:17 @realDonaldTrump   You, as president and all knowing business genius, are aware we only get a small percentage of our oil from the Saudis, right?  *sigh* of course you don’t.

694 2018-11-21 23:14:57 Nah, he and his republican puppets are morons for continuing policy that maintains our dependence on SA oil and funds terrorism. They are also traitors for letting the 1st amendment be trampled.

696 2018-11-21 23:14:37 Michelle, this person clearly has no morality. It’s probably a bot. He just said he’d rather see people killed than pay $0.05 more a gallon. IF THAT!  Only 10% of US oil comes from Saudia Arabia, and that is dropping every year.

700 2018-11-21 23:14:18 I remember the power cuts under Heath. Terrible. It was a dreadful era but ina aftermath of oil crisis the Unions decided to restrict coal supplies & blackmail government into a salary rise for miners.  Country could not afford it.  Heath went to country on “me vs Unions” & lost
701 2018-11-21 23:14:06 more and more people are living in poverty and becoming homeless every day. prices on oil are higher than they were for quite a while. you can't fool us, I can't wait until we hear more from Mueller
702 2018-11-21 23:14:01 if you add in oil of unknown origin , yer over 96%.

But on the plus side , they didny huv tae bomb the shit oota aberdeen to keep the price up , or protect the dollar.

707 2018-11-21 23:13:35 What are doing to make sure they're aware that your support of the oil/gas industry (and their overseas holidays and other non-essential consumer habits) are helping ensure a horrible future for millions of people. And that their families will not remain unaffected.
708 2018-11-21 23:13:28 We get 40% of our oil from Canada and only 8% from Saudi Arabia.  Sorry @realDonaldTrump ...as usual ...your excuses don't add up.... If you were truly #AmericaFirst you would respect & honor our democracy & constitution. #DonTheCon #SaudiArabia #SaudiArabiaFirst #TrumpLIES

710 2018-11-21 23:13:15 @teddyboylocsin was right to give a s**t about the oil deals China was setting up. But what if there was more to it, like literally declaring the surrender of the disputed areas to China in the undertones much like what Trillanes wanted to cover up?
711 2018-11-21 23:13:14 Canada sells oil to the US at significant discount compared to world market prices, too. Team us?

713 2018-11-21 23:13:07 Murder is OK if we get lower oil prices. No decency. @GOP Christian Values.
714 2018-11-21 23:12:59 We get 10% of our oil for KSA. Crucial petro dollar my ass.
715 2018-11-21 23:12:59 Note: 40% of US imported oil comes from Canada, 11% from Saudi Arabia. US buys Canadian oil at $15 / barrel and buys Saudi oil at $55 / barrel. So, who is keeping gas prices low in the US?

719 2018-11-21 23:12:54 They killed an American, and you praise them about oil?? Your poor children , bet you'd trade their lives for a good deal
720 2018-11-21 23:12:41 So, why are we exporting oil? It is a limited military strategic resource.
721 2018-11-21 23:12:32 Luke, I am sorry, but you are wrong. Most of Russia oil trade settles in $. Rosneft term sales to China were in $. Companies are working at present to allow other ways to settle, but it will take time
722 2018-11-21 23:12:30 Low oil prices are very bad for US producers.
723 2018-11-21 23:12:20 FYI: most US imported oil (40%) is from Canada, where we do not sanction murder.
724 2018-11-21 23:12:17 We get 40% of our oil from Canada and only 8% from Saudi Arabia.  Sorry...as usual ...your excuses don't add up.... If you were truly #AmericaFirst you would respect & honor our democracy & constitution. #DonTheCon #SaudiArabia #SaudiArabiaFirst #TrumpLIES
725 2018-11-21 23:12:13 So instead of Jesus dying for our sins should we now say Khashoggi died for lower oil prices?
726 2018-11-21 23:12:11 this important “One thought that does help is that the biggest pitfall of strategists is extrapolation–predicting that recent trends will continue at the same pace.”Oil crash helps Europe in big way. Transitory disinflation+ECB possible easing might produce +ve Euro growth shock
727 2018-11-21 23:12:04 Shep Smith on his @FoxNews show today informed the World that Saudi Arabia doesn't control oil prices in USA 
Hey Shep (aka shit4brains) no one "controls" oil prices 
728 2018-11-21 23:11:56 NEWSFLASH POTUS., Saudi's do not determine oil prices .
729 2018-11-21 23:11:54 Sorry you’re having a difficult time Alice, our Canadian govt has basically crushed the oil industry here. I’m forced to fuel my car with gas from Saudi oil. We need pipelines Alice, the liberals are traitors
730 2018-11-21 23:11:50 Saudi the journolist butchers give a brief reprieve of oil prices as a PR campaign. Once it’s out of the news it will be business as usual .Trump and MBS think alike killing journolists who dare cast light on despotic governments .
731 2018-11-21 23:11:44 They used to. My first exposure to Bradford diaries as a part of American history.
732 2018-11-21 23:11:41 So God truly sorted out the Widow with just a jar of oil to live on(2 Kings 4:1-7)? Do you have a problem for God? Tell Him!!
733 2018-11-21 23:11:37 Just so everyone knows the United States imports 40% of its Oil from Canada and only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
734 2018-11-21 23:11:35 Yeah, I guess that Saudi Arabia dropped prices to change the subject to oil and not a brutal murder authorized by their prince. They must have learned that from you. You have not even a drop of decency or humanity.

- Deuda 
- Dependencia o alta correlación con el momento del ciclo (ie oil, mining..), cuando baja la bolsa éstas bajan x2 o x3
- ROIC tirando a tristón
- Capital allocation dudoso
743 2018-11-21 23:10:53 That’s a mans job too. We should have to do nothing when it comes to vehicles!  Jason ended up taking me to get the oil change. He didn’t want to put up with the fit
744 2018-11-21 23:10:50 Leave it to the CBC to not understand the situation. Saudi Arabia is an OPEC member and OPEC has more control over global oil prices than Canada / US does. It is why monopolies are a bad idea. So Saudi taking action did in fact lower oil prices.
745 2018-11-21 23:10:49 Arab world is desperate for leaders who can cut corruption and create enough decent paying jobs that can absorb their young populations. With the exception of those lucky enough to rely on oil & gas extraction, the chances for the region look grim

749 2018-11-21 23:10:23 Letting Saudi Arabia get away with murder is great for oil prices. A great tradition since 9/11!
750 2018-11-21 23:10:19 My car sound way better after that oil change
751 2018-11-21 23:10:18 The wizards and warlocks of Big Pharma laugh all the way to the bank while they withold from us and essential nutrient..cannabis. The Extreme oil, Holy oil and Tincture are all made from cannabis. These vital nutrients will HEAL you and keep you well. God bless.
752 2018-11-21 23:10:16 Saudis provide 10% of our oil imports. Canada provides 40%. He should be 4x nicer to Canada if that was the reason.

LIES. Nothing but lies.
753 2018-11-21 23:10:14 It's supply & demand dipshit! China has stopped buying our oil, buying from Iran now ( I wonder why?). THIS created the oversupply of oil, thus prices have fallen. You need to stop satisfying your ego at OUR expense.

756 2018-11-21 23:10:05 So when the oil prices go up, it’s you who the Americans should blame not the Saudis. Right?

758 2018-11-21 23:10:03 Well the “deep heat” didn’t do anything so I am currently being overcome by the fumes of “tiger balm” which someone said would help  I might try dog oil next 
759 2018-11-21 23:10:01 I think I’m done eating at @McDonalds @McDonaldsCorp for a while. My fries literally smelled like sewer accidentally ate one and was honestly disgusted. Not sure if the associates did something or if they didn’t change the oil 
760 2018-11-21 23:09:59 Canada sells us 40% of our oil while Saudi Arabia sells us 11%. We are our biggest supplier of oil to ourselves. He just does not care about facts!
761 2018-11-21 23:09:55 Non. You need more recognition, my boy!
Das duh troof
762 2018-11-21 23:09:51 found a near empty bottle of cbd oil in my car while i was cleaning and there was just a tiny bit left (I thought) and so i just... drank it... and it was actually a lot and now im kinda hi :(
763 2018-11-21 23:09:45 Because of fracking? You have nothing to do right they price of oil. #damnyoustupid
764 2018-11-21 23:09:45 わか！！！あー！！！わかる！！！わかり！！！！！あー！！ー！！！
765 2018-11-21 23:09:38 Additional evidence that Trump is completely ignorant about economics and how it works. It's far too complex for his simpleton mind. Also, SA accounts for less than 10% of our oil imports. Just more misdirection to try to shift attention from his immoral actions yesterday.
766 2018-11-21 23:09:37 We will not be bribed by lower oil prices to condone murder.
767 2018-11-21 23:09:35 Don't you produce a lot of oil?
768 2018-11-21 23:09:32 10/ avoid plastic: don't get a plastic bag @ supermarket, bring your own, avoid bottled water, drink filtered/osmosis water or glass bottles. if an equal product exists in different material favor it over plastic. Only 9% of plastic is recycled. Plastic = Oil = greenhouse gases
769 2018-11-21 23:09:30 What happened to American oil? You remember the part where America was not dependent on foreign oil. How ridiculous you are to thank Suadi Arabia for ANYTHING!!
770 2018-11-21 23:09:21 らむいち 最高だと思うんですよね
771 2018-11-21 23:09:18 So, palm oil related deforestation, climate change and Saudi's abuse of power - one way to do your bit about all three is to give up air travel. Air travel is the most carbon-intensive activity you can do, so that's climate change. Most palm oil imported into EU is used as 1/

774 2018-11-21 23:09:01 We don't get much oil fron Saudi we have oil here ...stop dealing with the murderers ! The hijackers was from Saudi
775 2018-11-21 23:08:58 You meant to thank Canada, of course. We get a lot more oil from Canada.
776 2018-11-21 23:08:56 Just need a steady hand and some patience. Practice on your face first, have a hot shower and use coconut oil. It's the closest shave you can get, worth it every time. 
 
777 2018-11-21 23:08:53 Don’t forget to dispose of the old oil properly.
778 2018-11-21 23:08:52 It’s all about the oil prices which controlled by Saudi Arabia
779 2018-11-21 23:08:51 Good morning, don't be late for work o
780 2018-11-21 23:08:48 We still have $15 of oil! Regulators, and Altered State. And we have $12 Golden Goo.
781 2018-11-21 23:08:46 CND use twice as much Energy than then any country in the world, in order for CND to sustain our quality of life it needs Energy,  Energy from every level. If you want to aid the 3rd world out of extreme poverty it will take 100,000,000 bbl of oil just to live like Mexico.
782 2018-11-21 23:08:43 only 11 percent of us oil comes from saudi arabia....so really us cheap gas hasn't got a whole lot to do with saudi arabia
783 2018-11-21 23:08:35 Apart from the fact that Kissinger had the Saudis agree to prove oil in dollars in return for an American shield.  Thus ensuring the funding of endless US consumerism without which you’d be fucked
784 2018-11-21 23:08:27 Who else does Saudi Arabia want him to sacrifice for lower oil prices. Yep. #BloodForOil
785 2018-11-21 23:08:19 Oil prices down from $82 to $54 in international market. When People of Pakistan will get benefit from declining trend of oil prices in international market?
786 2018-11-21 23:08:18 oil
787 2018-11-21 23:08:08 Yeah. Absolutely correct in ur assessment that ur only unhip now and not in the past.
788 2018-11-21 23:08:06 Whisky or oil of cloves 
789 2018-11-21 23:07:59 Canada produces 40% of our oil. Saudi Arabia 9%. 
Do you see the bullshit? Guaranteed his followers don’t.
790 2018-11-21 23:07:53 Except the federal government DID NOTHING to help Alberta sell its oil to other countries. Alberta asked for pipelines and got zero in return. What’s the point of building more plants if there is no pipelines.
This is all federal governments fault.
791 2018-11-21 23:07:52 Since men think we can’t take care of our cars ladies: get your oil changed, get warranty on your tires, make sure you have a spare tire, change the air filters, check your fluids, get regular tire rotations & maintenance checks.
792 2018-11-21 23:07:47 Chavez got elected promising free stuff When Congress wouldn't pass it he disbanded them & rewrote constitution. Used oil money to subsidize prices often below cost of production. When oil prices dropped subsidy money no longer available but price controls remained. No production
793 2018-11-21 23:07:44 It’s really flavorful. You can just barely cook it so it’s soft but not mushy. Little olive oil and salt and pepper and it’s perfect. You can also cook it well done and it’s really soft, but still tasty.
794 2018-11-21 23:07:41 Spilled olive oil all over the kitc hen no choice but to slide right in this @cheerios am I right mmm I love cheerios
795 2018-11-21 23:07:39 Saudi perpetrated the largest terror attack on US soil ever, we only buy <10% of oil from them, they chopped our journalist in to pieces, I’m paying almost 4.00 a gallon for gas, and they’re starving Yemeni children. They are not doing anything for this country. It’s about you !!
796 2018-11-21 23:07:37 You must have gotten wealthy in oil futures.. after all you are an expert arent you ? That's how your acting anyway
797 2018-11-21 23:07:35 You have no idea how the world oil market works. Just resign.
798 2018-11-21 23:07:33 In oRegon gas prices have dropped a whopping 10 cents for a near 30$ drop in oil prices.  Geez thanks. I needed parking $ For approx 20 minutes..
799 2018-11-21 23:07:30 We get 40% of our oil from Canada and only 8% from Saudi Arabia.  Sorry @realDonaldTrump ...as usual ...your excuses don't add up.... If you were truly #AmericaFirst you would respect & honor our democracy & constitution. #DonTheCon #SaudiArabia #SaudiArabiaFirst #TrumpLIES

*we start making out*
803 2018-11-21 23:07:14 Maybe we can get a sliding scale oil discount by letting them kill, at their discretion, anyone causing them problems here stateside.  @#KillToFill
804 2018-11-21 23:07:13 Or are lower oil prices a Saudi pay off for US support? Covering murder?

807 2018-11-21 23:07:02 Hey Saudi Arabia I know of an obese orange blubber boy that even your fine cutting tools couldn't get through. He'd squeal like a big ol sow though and you'd make a fortune on that recording. He's fine with SA slaughtering humans as long as you lower the cost of oil. Have at him.
808 2018-11-21 23:07:00 Cashew nuts contain oil in the shell that is very irritating to the skin
809 2018-11-21 23:06:54 Albanians, continue to sell the marajuana oil Steve Marshall banned bc if I can make $ from it, it’s not illegal (using trump dumps logic to continue selling weapons to the saudis)
810 2018-11-21 23:06:51 Nope! I don't brine any more. Sometimes, I pre-salt poultry, per the late great chef Judy Rogers (Zuni Cafe, SF), but this time, I'm just gonna oil him up, salt and pepper him, and roast.
811 2018-11-21 23:06:48 As long as oil flows in a low price the States approves and the Israeli Prime minister is happy with his Arab neighbors , no one will give a damn about the American values of democracy, human rights and liberty in #MENA
812 2018-11-21 23:06:44 I just woke up n its just 12 wow
813 2018-11-21 23:06:41 You are so ignorant! Where do you think most of your oil comes from? Do some reading!

816 2018-11-21 23:06:28 Could be wrong but I will wager over a longer time line, the 9th Circuit is number 1. Also note that the 9th is the 'go-to' court for environmentalists looking to stop oil and mining projects.
817 2018-11-21 23:06:26 .@realDonaldTrump you’re just spreading more BS. The global oil markets prices are low because of a glut due to production in Russia, Iran, the US, Venezuela, and elsewhere. The Saudis need the US more than we need them to help stabilize the Region. #StopSuckingUp!
818 2018-11-21 23:06:25 Well, not sure we should be so grateful for Canadian oil and the pipeline they keep pushing on us.
819 2018-11-21 23:06:21 So it’s ok to murder an American journalist as long as you lower oil prices.
820 2018-11-21 23:06:20 He should thank CANADA instead as most of US Oil are coming from CANADA!!!
821 2018-11-21 23:06:07 I said nothing about who we import oil from but who exports to the world (total oil supply).  We are #1 and Saudi Arabia is #2. Canada is a distant #4 so it has little impact on total oil supply and therefore little impact on oil price.
822 2018-11-21 23:06:03 Should have taken the oil fields in 1945.

824 2018-11-21 23:05:38 You must be alright with it too you've filled your gas tank hundreds of times since then with gas made from Saudi oil and u never said a word
825 2018-11-21 23:05:37 You are killing the US Oil and Gas industry, putting real Americans out of work. Mostly your supporters. Not great.
826 2018-11-21 23:05:35 A reader would like to know if she can get a full fill of oil and pay in installments
827 2018-11-21 23:05:33 ... Health Care. He has ruined farmers' markets & driven businesses from our shores or out of business with his tariffs. He supports a murder ing foreign leader who hurts U.S. oil workers by suppressing the price of oil. Now, he is trying to subvert the DOJ & courts. Do not ...
828 2018-11-21 23:05:27 Instead of 2 TBS shortening, I use 4 TBS of melted butter, and I grease my loaf pan with coconut oil.
829 2018-11-21 23:05:22 Saudis could probably kill Ivanka and he’d say “it is what it is.” Money and oil is more important to him. Ivanka would have to take one for the team.
830 2018-11-21 23:05:20 You need to tell the @POTUS to stop wanting to lower oil prices! Your state depends on high oil prices!
831 2018-11-21 23:05:18 I mean, also, just avoiding oil-heavy activities like air travel also helps - it's also the best way to cut down on palm oil use, as it happens (most palm oil in EU is bio-diesel, not food), and you're also helping mitigate climate change.
832 2018-11-21 23:05:17 No! Please consider the hundreds of thousands of US oil field workers that will be layed off if prices go any lower. I guarentee it is already happening. There is no reason why a gal of gas should be the same as 20 years ago. We have families too! Only issue I disagree w you on.
833 2018-11-21 23:05:16 Do you have figures for rapeseed oil?

834 2018-11-21 23:04:24 Absolutely on point. They now control all the oil fields east of the Euphrates

837 2018-11-21 23:03:55 Meanwhile the American Oil drill industry collapses because the Saudi’s dump subsidized oil onto the market.wonder how much kickback money Trump is getting

842 2018-11-21 23:03:45 Markets rebounded overnight, lead by a bounce in Oil, going in to the big US holiday of Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving should ensure market close a volatile week quietly. The exception would be some Geo-Political event, perhaps the EU turmoil may deliver? #HappyThanksgiving #forex
843 2018-11-21 23:03:44 The price of oil fell world wide
844 2018-11-21 23:03:42 This is such a good idea that investors are lining up at our borders to invest in the oil patch.

848 2018-11-21 23:03:37 Is this really a thing a President should be doing? Don't you have a Sheiks ass to kiss to lower the oil prices more?
849 2018-11-21 23:03:23 Wow!  Yeah that looks like him.

I only met him the one day; he helped us tie up at Roland Martin, recommended the burger there, and told my friend and I where to get the oil we needed because our sail drive had been electrolysized into cheese.

Small world
850 2018-11-21 23:03:18 Donald Trump has just tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to 'a big Tax Cut for America and the World!' In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia. CBC NEWS
851 2018-11-21 23:03:09 Liars - you destroyed the economy of this country. You are doing it now to gain votes but it is too late. What is remaining in the economy- housing market collapsed- oil industry destroyed- what is remaining ?
852 2018-11-21 23:02:47 Same for #BigOil. All subsidies should go to #renewables to save mankind. $10m a minute to the oil industry is ridiculous!
@ClimateReality
853 2018-11-21 23:02:44 Yeah, but 2019 is coming and Alberta oil is losing money, and 2020. At some point we will have to pay that massive debt back.
854 2018-11-21 23:02:41 Then Thanks HIM for oil prices.  The life of a digusting human being.

860 2018-11-21 23:02:16 Saudi sets the benchmark price for Oil simply by jawboning their production.  Not Canada.  Big difference.
861 2018-11-21 23:02:13 Psssst....Canada (yes the good guys) supplies the USA with about 4x the amount of oil that Saudi Arabia does. Also we’ve been standing up to them for years. We are ready to be friends again when you get rid of Trumpty Dumpty.
862 2018-11-21 23:02:13 Sadly it's not even for oil and arms. It's for all the overpriced, tacky Trump properties they buy.
863 2018-11-21 23:02:12 Just thank President for lowering the oil barrel for us! We will gained more MONEY, food costs will go down!
864 2018-11-21 23:02:08 ok you realise fossil fuel companies will go away over time. Isn’t it true that big oil has for decades blocked clean tech?
865 2018-11-21 23:02:08 Has anyone tried oil pulling?
866 2018-11-21 23:02:02 The murder has absolutely nothing to do with America or the people. President Trump is correct by staying out of the fake news frenzy this way its keeps our oil prices down. Demoshits should look, listen, learn sometimes it’s better to not get involved so America can afford gas
867 2018-11-21 23:02:01 He’s just demonstrated that 1) America is subservient to Saudi by ignoring dismemberment 2) that the US is no longer a humanitarian nation 3) that US can be bought with oil.
868 2018-11-21 23:01:53 The country can live off $60/bbl oil, but a large part of your voting base can’t live off less than $50/bbl of oil. Your going to lose voters and lots of 6 figure jobs if you crash oil prices! #oilandgas
869 2018-11-21 23:01:52 If they had oil or spent a lot of money at your shitty hotels, they would be your best buddies
870 2018-11-21 23:01:51 That oil be having a nigga feeling great
871 2018-11-21 23:01:46 They really don’t come any dumber than Donald Trump. The carnival barker says to Saudi Arabia, keep oil prices low & you can kill anyone you want. You won’t get any trouble fro me. Then he tries to match wits with Chief Justice John Roberts. No contest
872 2018-11-21 23:01:43 I take a sip from oil yellow it take me down to a lower level
873 2018-11-21 23:01:43 OMG .  You are such a liar and traitor.  Oil prices are lower because of the HUGE supply of American oil.  America first or Saudi Arabia first?
874 2018-11-21 23:01:38 What we see in Syria is the result of that decision. It's neither a revolution nor torture.
It's a geopolitical game. This is why the US troops in Syria first secured oil and gave a s*** on ISIS or Al Qaeda. Bush's "War on Terror" was a fake since minute one.
875 2018-11-21 23:01:34 Little does he know most oil come from the Canadian  market  around 40% and around 10% comes from  Saudi Arabia just prooves how stupid he is

I am fully aware of the fact that the oil industry is big business, which is a main reason I don't trust them to care for us
884 2018-11-21 23:00:56 @billmckibben The biofuel/palm oil/deforestation debacle in Borneo and Indonesia is a classic case of U.S. energy mandates having disastrous consequences ecologically for 3rd world countries producing  palm oil and > CO2 emission consequences for mother earth in general.

889 2018-11-21 23:00:33 Maddening that the only policy  the Liberals can come up with is more corporate welfare for Big Oil/Wind. We've seen this before in Ontario, subsidizing the energy industry only  fattens the profits of  large corporations at the expense of  families.
890 2018-11-21 23:00:29 Astounding to see oil and fed pieces being recycled while Trump’s frenetic incompetence unfurls all around us. If you’re searching for a more palatable narrative to appease conservative clients you’re a scrub

901 2018-11-21 23:00:16 I love my CBD Oil  , I love it's calming Effect and Pain Reducing Effect.
902 2018-11-21 23:00:15 You have no more bearing on oil prices than any president has. That is to say none.
903 2018-11-21 23:00:11 Mr. President, Saudi Arabia accounts for only 11% of your oil and Canada supplies 40%.  Just read your economics reports, it’s hard work we understand.
904 2018-11-21 23:00:06 I just paid $3 per gallon. I’d like to know about this “cheaper” oil
905 2018-11-21 23:00:06 Not sure about the cozying up to the Saudis part, but awesome job he did with getting them to drop oil prices. Been seeing a big change at the pump last couple weeks.
906 2018-11-21 23:00:00 I mean, on top of everything else, it's a flat-out LIE (as usual). The United States is now the world's largest oil exporter, not KSA.
907 2018-11-21 22:59:45 Always the money, of course!!  But 4 a President of the US to pick out a commodity & harp nonstop about driving it market price down--incredibly inappropriate/unseemly-UGH My belief-very important & well connected people keep "inciting" him on "wipe out PR debt" and "cheap oil"
908 2018-11-21 22:59:42 I lived under Klein. He did it by gutting the heritage fund, a fund Alberta needed desperately when Oil took a massive dip. It’s only recovering now under Notley.
909 2018-11-21 22:59:38 Oil prices are going down because the Fed increased interest rates.
910 2018-11-21 22:59:36 However, this is bad for domestic producers in the US who have higher fixed costs. Much lower and the oil shale business will be pinched hard throwing one group of Americans out of work and increasing US energy dependency. The Saudis have you by the balls & you don't even know it
911 2018-11-21 22:59:33 YES, the pipelines have much less impact on the environment than trucks, rail and tankers from Saudi Arabia - and oil will be moved 1 way or the other
912 2018-11-21 22:59:21 Canada produces 40% of our oil. Saudi Arabia 9%. 
Do you see the bullshit? Guaranteed his followers don’t.
913 2018-11-21 22:59:20 Depends on if they are garlic mashed, Parmesan mashed, or some other variety. As vegetarians (we do dairy) , we tend to flavor the potatoes and not add gravy, but a little olive oil is nice!

915 2018-11-21 22:59:14 The U.S. gets more oil from Canada than it does from KSA.
916 2018-11-21 22:59:11 Low oil prices will mean oil industry layoffs.
917 2018-11-21 22:59:05 In a couple of years Canada and Mexico will be out of the oil business. They built their oil industry up when a barrel of oil was around $48-53 per barrel! With Corn Fuel starting to be produced in the States that will drive prices lower at the pump. Good Bye Canada & Mexico
918 2018-11-21 22:59:03 Do you even know how this works? Ask someone who knows where most of our oil comes from. You are despicable.
919 2018-11-21 22:59:01 In need of a CBD oil massage....where can one go to get one in Toronto?
920 2018-11-21 22:58:59 As for Trump thinking we are getting lower cost fuel because we're choosing to side with a murderous regime, that's sad and morally bankrupt. Price of oil goes up and down without the US having to sell our soul and bow before Saudi Arabia.
921 2018-11-21 22:58:58 ...and that lower oil prices justify a grisly assassination.
922 2018-11-21 22:58:51 We saw this in Saskatchewan when business would blame the NDP gov't for not providing the proper business climate, not fixing the infrastructure, high taxes, driving away businesses and jov seekers, bad Riders seasons...
Now oil is down, business is bad and suddenly all is quiet.
923 2018-11-21 22:58:49 Peter Lougheed said that "Alberta can only sell its oil once." Implying that it should never sell at a discount (let alone a deep one). @RachelNotley needs to follow PL's example & curtail exports to a minimum, until pipelines are built. #ABpoli #ableg @RedDeerAdvocate
924 2018-11-21 22:58:46 What deal is that ? Lower the oil price and I’ll look the other way when you murder and dismember innocent people ? You Christian, Steph ? Murder doesn’t matter if there’s money coming your way ? WTF has happened to you people ? God Almighty !!
925 2018-11-21 22:58:41 I'm not willing to pay more for oil because the Saudi's want to kill one of their own. @realDonaldTrump is right.
926 2018-11-21 22:58:39 Agree  between Obama judges ( really) and lies about  Saudis oil we don’t need or hundreds thousand job oh please it’s Saudi first for trump not America
927 2018-11-21 22:58:38 isnt CBD oil why yuor channel was terminated? I would be scared to make this video it will get you terminated again
928 2018-11-21 22:58:36 Lower? Economists are already afraid of lowering oil prices, and how it will affect our economy, Not that I mind lower prices, but I'm not convinced it is a good thing. Also, receiving oil from a country we know assasinates people is wrong.
929 2018-11-21 22:58:36 Low oil price is harder on jobs locally for us than the benefit of cheaper gas.  When oil dipped last time there were alot of pivots getting new wiring.  Direct correlation.
930 2018-11-21 22:58:36 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
931 2018-11-21 22:58:31 Go ahead and let them kill another American citizen, and then you can talk about lowering oil prices
932 2018-11-21 22:58:30 Oil prices may be lower, but gas prices are higher they have been in four years.  Check the stats.
933 2018-11-21 22:58:24 This one place really tried to charge me 120 for an oil change like y’all thought they hear Cadillac and be trying to charge you like my oil changes are only 60$ no more than that !
934 2018-11-21 22:58:23 @Riedle I've been receiving medical cannabis (flower & oil) for a couple years. We have ended prohibition here, but I continue with my producer.  Supply on rec side is low and scoring can be frustrating.

935 2018-11-21 22:58:22 No they're not. They facilitated ISIS members, bought their oil, conducted business with them.

939 2018-11-21 22:58:02 Thanks Saudi, now you can go and murder and dismember another reporter. And we will turn our head again. That should lower oil prices. Mr Trump your and embarrassment!
940 2018-11-21 22:57:55 I was anti tomato for a long time. Now I love cherry tomatoes. Especially if you dress them with some salt, pepper, and olive oil and let them sit for a bit! Caprese is another good gateway for getting into tomatoes 
941 2018-11-21 22:57:51 I bought some wine and had my oil changed and that feels like a pretty productive day off.
942 2018-11-21 22:57:51 Anyone want to be commissioned for an oil pastel rooster?
943 2018-11-21 22:57:49 you could do something like restrict the number of barrels of oil pulled out of the earth every year, and set the number to decline over time.
944 2018-11-21 22:57:47 How disgusting. Immediately prior to a uniquely American Day of Thanks the President of the United States thanks a foreign psychopathic butcher for low oil prices. Really kind of makes you get all misty-eyed, doesn’t it?
945 2018-11-21 22:57:46 @POTUS We don’t need to thank anyone that gas prices went down because WE DONT NEED GAS for our cars anymore. It’s 2018. We are moving to electric vehicles & we can charge at our house. Goodbye gas stations. Goodbye Saudi Arabia. Goodbye blood oil. Goodbye you, ya dotard  #BeBest
946 2018-11-21 22:57:43 Canada provides USA with 40% of oil.  Saudi Arabia provides 11%.  Why is Trump making such a big deal?

I look forward to separate on media hand-outs.
950 2018-11-21 22:57:26 Can one of Trumps advisor please explain Saudi Arabia doesn’t control the price of oil?   Supply, demand and oil futures.

955 2018-11-21 22:57:08 Violence is the polar opposite of anarchy.
And I would agree, if someone thinks it's fine to kill the planet, invade countries for oil, put profit over people & generally be a selfish capitalist c**t then yeh, they're the enemy.
We're all the enemy to the elite who run the world
956 2018-11-21 22:57:07 comments and tweets about how OPEC treats us in raising the price of oil around the world. Obviously, the president wants to change that factor and if many people convince him of passing this bill and signing into law then we would be one step closer of holding...

958 2018-11-21 22:57:06 Also interesting.
959 2018-11-21 22:57:04 Oil Technician: “we have our conventional for $35 and our synthetic blend on sale for $10 off at $55”

My brain: 
Don’t do it
Don’t do it
Don’t do it
Don’t do it

Me: let’s do the synthetic blend 
960 2018-11-21 22:57:03 For lower oil prices
961 2018-11-21 22:57:02 How many trees worth of paper is that? How much oil worth of ink? Yeeesh
962 2018-11-21 22:57:02 The actual number of cases by circuit that make it to SCOTUS is relevant.  If 1 case of 1 from the 5th was overturned this is 100%
If only 2 of 3 from 9th overturned it's only 2/3, but still twice the rate of the 5th.
Statistics not fully presented #FakeNews
963 2018-11-21 22:57:01 and then he made a ton of money wildcatting oil had an illegitimate who turned into a washed up nobody pitcher named Montgomery and spent $30 million in 30 days and inherited $300 million of Brusstar's millions!
964 2018-11-21 22:57:00 I agree and it will more likely than not kill the USA shale oil industry.
965 2018-11-21 22:56:58 This does not mean Oil price over a American murder.  You are a disgrace to this Country...
966 2018-11-21 22:56:58 Interesting new dynamics in the international oil market. Let’s hope that it brings stability of the prices.
967 2018-11-21 22:56:53 Remember when Palm Oil was the great big ;environmental product - now it is destroying huge chunks of the rainforest - another @greenparty_ie clusterfuck
968 2018-11-21 22:56:49 11% toots. We import 11% of our oil from Saudi Arabia. You are complicit in the brutal murder of a journalist for a lousy 11%.
969 2018-11-21 22:56:32 You've been drinking too much of the Kool Aid, man.  Our economy needs to be diverse and include developing our natural resources.  We will need oil for many years to come, so we might as well use our own rather than import it from the likes of those in the middle east.
970 2018-11-21 22:56:31 Wait I thought presidents don't impact global markets such as oil? Hannity told me so *checks notes* eight years ago. Wait a minute...
971 2018-11-21 22:56:30 Use olive oil or nuttelex instead of butter, and a non-dairy milk. Replace the parmesan with nutritional yeast+salt, and either top it with a vegan cheese or breadcrumbs
972 2018-11-21 22:56:28 It’s not about oil and arms.  It’s about his personal finance.
973 2018-11-21 22:56:16 saudi arabia with there oil rich trillions do zero to help their fellow muslim refugees while we offer refuge they pilgramage there and yet hate us.
974 2018-11-21 22:56:15 ...70 dollars for an oil change? Men ain’t shit.
975 2018-11-21 22:56:08 Sadly if you're a stetson-wearing oil magnate you might strongly disagree. Though it would be lovely to think not. I'd say UK Govt is seriously anti renewable energy and seems to support anything but. We might see it as the obvious future, but some people are living in the past.
976 2018-11-21 22:56:05 Is it any wonder that Trump thinks he’s putting ‘America First’ by prioritizing oil and arms transactions with the Saudis above moral leadership, decency and indignation in the face of murder.
977 2018-11-21 22:56:03 Meanwhile, the #US occupies the part of #Syria that is richer in oil resources as a means to keep the Kurds content, the government’s coffers dwindling, and people miserable.
978 2018-11-21 22:55:58 In addition, oil spills are almost always substantially larger than first announced. Leakages of natural gas production are almost never announced since the evidence is seldom apparent, even if the environmental consequences are.
979 2018-11-21 22:55:57 Or just oil in general 
980 2018-11-21 22:55:45 So you are saying they did the right thing by you because they have lowered fuel prices.

How does that help the USA shale oil industry?

I suspect it will kill it overtime.
981 2018-11-21 22:55:44 Why does anyone think a cowardly Premier who left Sask with a fiscal shit pie to make his money in oil industry want to listen to him? Brad Wall failed twice in business and once in politics yet Conservatives fondle his nads.
982 2018-11-21 22:55:44 Corbyn, along with Labour, is now pushing some snake oil rubbish called a “Jobs First Brexit”. 

Corbyn wants a Brexit but at HIS terms. He’s just as bad on Brexit as the Tories.
983 2018-11-21 22:55:41 I like you Trump, but I think you wrong for saying that.i’m a Offshore crewboat37 Owner that has 1 boat and now because your lower oil prices im going out of business!!  I’m very disappointed in this action you taking in this matter!!  You might lose my vote!
984 2018-11-21 22:55:38 These top officials put their gas and home heating oil on their govt expense credit cards ! They don’t care if the prices go up if we don’t get oil from Saudi Arabia.
985 2018-11-21 22:55:35 Don't forget..SA and China own more of America than Americans do..There is sooo much more at play than just oil.Din't people understand that making enemies with certain countries would literally destroy America?What happens if they decide to pull out the TRILLIONS they invest?
986 2018-11-21 22:55:20 what's really funny is wait till the oil companies start laying off oil field workers because of the low oil prices.
987 2018-11-21 22:55:16 Hey #abpoli - Trudeau 1st NEP banned exports of Canadian oil to ensure Ontario & Quebec paid lowest price. Trudeau 2nd ban on oil export pipelines has had the same effect!  Either way, Alberta economy is devastated! @albertaNDP @Alberta_UCP @AlbertansFirst #ableg #cdnpoli
988 2018-11-21 22:55:14 Balance - it is all about balance. Could you imagine the outcry if he were to suddenly announce an end to big oil projects?

990 2018-11-21 22:55:04 Surely this amounts to bribery... Look the other way and oil prices will go down...
991 2018-11-21 22:55:00 That's a big if. @FineGael could come out tomorrow to support the Climate Emergecy Bill to end all oil/gas exploration. That would be a quick signal to test whether they're serious.
992 2018-11-21 22:54:56 Polievre Energy East was cancelled by company because of huge oil price losses Not by any gov Yet as expected not challenged by @VassyKapelos

993 2018-11-21 22:54:54 Rusty, where is the liberty and equality of our forests being given to loggers to harvest trees for profit?  That is land that is intended for you and I to use, not for the wood industry or the oil industry or the mining industry to have a monopoly on it.
994 2018-11-21 22:54:52 Looks like a small price to pay for the great deal on oil our president is winning over for us no one really cares about this statement as though it was some sort of condoning practice to Saudi Arabians

997 2018-11-21 22:54:37 Does he realize the Saudis only supply 11% of US oil, while Canada supplies 40%? He should be condemning them ( as we did) and thanking us 
998 2018-11-21 22:54:28 So, they've lowered our oil prices, and you've lowered our ethical standards.

Kudos.
999 2018-11-21 22:54:27 What part of #soldout did you not get lmao we can get them at Lucas oil
1000 2018-11-21 22:54:23 This is the kind of news the oil bears don't want you to see.
In Russia the 1,457,857 new cars and LCVs sold in the first ten months of 2018 represented an increase of 14.1% over the same period in 2017.
1001 2018-11-21 22:54:19 The fact that  supplies 40% is immaterial. It's not about oil.
1002 2018-11-21 22:54:15 A US citizen is killed and Trump stands with nation who killed that citizen, they have the oil and trump will not threaten a relation with them becaue of the oil it's that simple
1003 2018-11-21 22:54:14 It’s £1.36 a litre in the uk goes up wether or not the oil barrels are cheaper and the Brits swallow it !
1004 2018-11-21 22:54:08 Canada is selling oil to USA for $14. Then we buy it back for $54 on the east coast. That’s why your citizens oppose any Canadian pipeline to tidewater. They are paying to oppose it. Tides. HP. Soros. Etc.
1005 2018-11-21 22:54:03 Dear President Trump,with all the agencies under your authority,tell us whether the crown prince was directly involved in the assasination.Yes or no? Second,the most important product for the US economy is the values of human rights and not the oil.

licking clean its plate
1007 2018-11-21 22:54:00 It’s like putting oil in the fuel tank, yes the car needs oil, but if you don’t put it where it’s needed it’s never going to work.....
1008 2018-11-21 22:54:00 America First doesn’t resonate with what you have chosen to do. America doesn’t trade blood for oil.  We are a civilized nation something you neither know anything about or have contributed too. You are a barbarian and do not deserve to be an American.

He campaigned on moving the Israeli embassy to Jerusalem, he wouldn’t have done that without getting the Saudis onboard first. He campaigned on keeping oil prices down to reduce energy costs...

1012 2018-11-21 22:53:31 Gasoline should be $.50/gallon, fuel oil $.35/gallon. Is the Middle East going to eat and drink oil? We have enough to change the market and control it, why don't we?
1013 2018-11-21 22:53:28 Outside, big pot of oil, REMOVE POT FROM FIRE BEFORE PUTTING TURKEY IN, let it overflow and do all the wild stuff away from the flames, once the skin is nice and crispy, finish in the oven. Really no need to fully fry it once it’s sealed and crispy

1018 2018-11-21 22:53:17 But since we get so LITTLE of our oil from the Middle east...no worries!
1019 2018-11-21 22:53:14 Never mind we 80% of oil produced here not in Saudi Arabia. He always gaslighting Americans. Lower than worm sweat!
1020 2018-11-21 22:53:14 Seems mighty generous to Harper's last year.
1021 2018-11-21 22:53:13 Thanking Saudis. Welcome, Saudis! You can kill any American you want for the price of oil!
1022 2018-11-21 22:53:07 Well everyone knows this has nothing to do with oil prices, it is about his @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @GOP personal interest
1023 2018-11-21 22:53:06 Thought Donnie was all about "America 1st". Artificially low oil prices kill the US oil industry, which is what the Saudis want.
1024 2018-11-21 22:53:05 How will you stop Syria from getting oil when they get it from Iran? Is that the THREAT? IRAN. WILL PAY?
1025 2018-11-21 22:53:03 I'm thinking the oil industry is not upset with Trump.
1026 2018-11-21 22:53:00 Vassy you’re a great journalist however it seems here you’re less focused on what morneaus update stated which is no balanced budget no mention of oil no support to the average working person and no roll back of taxes.  Pls get back to journalism basics
1027 2018-11-21 22:53:00 Yo instead of using lotion this nigga is using OIL ON MY FEET. 
1028 2018-11-21 22:52:58 US carriers need to get out of the middle east! Why are we there? We pump more oil in America than any other country! U.S. carriers are within missile range of Russia, China, Israel, and England! So what !!! Nuclear war will kill all of us, so it does not matter who shoots first.

1030 2018-11-21 22:52:49 Saudis are not responsible for reduction in oil prices. Quite the opposite. Canada and US supply most of our oil. Trump is flattering his murderous friend, Crown Prince.
1031 2018-11-21 22:52:42 Saudi Arabia to Trump: If you turn a blind eye to the you know what in the you know where, then we'll drop oil prices and you can Tweet about it.

Trump: woof woof yes please woof woof <wags tail>

Saudi: Good boy <pats head>
1032 2018-11-21 22:52:41 I spoke up for Trump and against Trudeau on @CTVNews yesterday and the Left went crazy on me, loved it lol and I moved from Calgary to Pittsburgh PA in oil and gas business and it’s booming thanks to Trump!

This is so wack! We haven’t had a working stove since #MVGasFire
1035 2018-11-21 22:52:33 He should instead say thanks to Canada. We send you much, much more oil than the Saudis.

1039 2018-11-21 22:52:21 Don't know about them but I think all those countries involved got more to do with oil pipelines and the Greater Israel project. 
Which are also directly leading to the Rothschilds.
1040 2018-11-21 22:52:14 Gruesome! Recipe: 1 tbsp oil, ginger, garlic, rice, spices and 1 chopped up boyfriend!
1041 2018-11-21 22:52:12 The US plan is to create a war, painting Iran as the biggest sponsor of Terrorism, when in fact Saudi and US, Israel are! Also control Syria to build a Saudi pipeline. It is all for Oil, not to bring democracy to the people of Iran! Unfortunately!
1042 2018-11-21 22:52:01 This weekend thousands of dads will be telling their daughters they need to get their oil changed
1043 2018-11-21 22:51:59 Plus the fact he, once again, completely distorts facts. If you really want to congratulate a foreign country for lower oil prices, call Trudeau.
1044 2018-11-21 22:51:58 Comfry oil will sort that out
1045 2018-11-21 22:51:57 Bugger debt-to-GDP ratio. If the budget is ever balanced paying down the debt should be the goal. The next cycle of expensive borrowing will hurt us bad.
1046 2018-11-21 22:51:53 Only if they have oil or buy weapons
1047 2018-11-21 22:51:51 What base is it when you kill a journalist and he says thanks for the oil prices
1048 2018-11-21 22:51:45 The US imports nearly FOUR TIMES AS MUCH OIL FROM CANADA than it does from Saudi Arabia.

Canada does not kill and mutilate journalists.

1056 2018-11-21 22:51:07 My frustration is in ALL OF HIS lies! And the fact that his supporters blindly believe the lies. Oil has not been $82 since 2014...his base won't fact check..and he knows it..so he keeps lying. It goes against everything I believe in, and every value I taught my children!
1057 2018-11-21 22:51:03 Shame on you ksa

1063 2018-11-21 22:50:48 Andrea Mitchell knows that the USA was stuck in a difficult position. The Saudi’s could simply by cutting the flow of oil causing massive increases at the pump.

1070 2018-11-21 22:49:54 For years we were tied up in the Middle East because we were dependent on their oil.  "We have to be energy self-sufficient...it is causing lives and ruining our economy."   Now, for some reason (we can guess) they want us right back in the turmoil.
1071 2018-11-21 22:49:41 @Oil_Drop The decisive goals by Calgary and the opening-minute warning in San Jose came from rebounds, didn't they? Defenders are required to clear them but a couple of these seemed really fat.
1072 2018-11-21 22:49:40 Really? So if oil is 140 , the Canadians will sell for 40?? How can this even be news
1073 2018-11-21 22:49:38 We should definitely end the idiotic wr on drugs. Biggest fan of that is cartels. Leads to the violence and corruption. No reason these place should be on level of Spain if not for that. Oil, natural resources, tourism, oceans on both coasts...no reason.
1074 2018-11-21 22:49:38 You do realize a majority of our oil is domestic. Saudi first! America Next! #NotMyPresident
1075 2018-11-21 22:49:36 It's literally an identical process to extracting essential oil from plant materials, like lavender or rosemary. All you need is ethanol. Pretty scary huh??

1085 2018-11-21 22:48:59 @oil_saburo テイクオフQヒットおめでとうございまーす
1086 2018-11-21 22:48:56 ...old remedy is to soak it oil, like sewing machine oil, light oil...then it would slip apart easier, not tried it myself
1087 2018-11-21 22:48:52 None of those families will have homes safe from cyclones, tornadoes, flooding or fires if the coal fuel industries go on as before. They spent so long locating the oil remains of dinosaurs, they became dinosaurs themselves.

1088 2018-11-21 22:48:52 When trying to punish, one should not stop selling to them, one should stop buying from them.  Trump has driven oil prices lower while those who conplain he has done nothing drive to work
1089 2018-11-21 22:48:50 Journalistic integrity in Canada purchased at bargain basement prices ...just like our oil.#cndpoli
1090 2018-11-21 22:48:39 You're really doubling down on the haven't-learned-a-thing-from-the-past demographic.
1091 2018-11-21 22:48:37 Peppermints tea/oil, camomile tea,  tea tree oil, cayenne pepper, massage your temples.. there's so much..oh and drunks lots of water #headass
1092 2018-11-21 22:48:31 And, by wanting their oil prices to go down further.....he's hurting US oil producers.  What an idiot.
1093 2018-11-21 22:48:27 actually i wonder if this would b that hard. what do you do, put gelatin in simple syrup with flavoring and weed oil
1094 2018-11-21 22:48:21 @realDonaldTrump Doesn’t Canada produce more oil (40%) than the Saudi Arabia to US?  Saudi’s only supply 9% but you know that right?  America First is really Trump First $$$
1095 2018-11-21 22:48:16 OMg Skippy. We don't want your stupid pipelines or tarsands. Stop being a lobbyist for foreign oil. #pnpcbc @PierrePoilievre
1096 2018-11-21 22:48:11 Sa panahon ngayon coconut oil nalang ang virgin HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA
1097 2018-11-21 22:48:09 So much nonsense from the liberals, if the windmills can produce enough energy then v can dump the oil in a heartbeat, but...Even in Europe, boats filled with coal r running nonstop in the Rhine River, cranes at ports r equipped to handle oil/coal only, this is the reality today
1098 2018-11-21 22:48:05 Why do we need oil from anyone? The United States is now the largest producer of oil ???
1099 2018-11-21 22:47:56 So many things wrong with this tweet, the first of which is that markets determine oil prices. For all the MAGAs reading this- don’t believe him, Saudi A. is not the #1 oil supplier for USA and they can only effect supply and not demand/prices.
1100 2018-11-21 22:47:54 I went last night just to get olive oil and....it was a mistake
1101 2018-11-21 22:47:33 Keeping people in prison is _expensive_, and the longer they're in the more likely they'll be unable to function in normal society. I believe the window is somewhere from two to four years. NB treats four years in prison as a permanent disability. Aspergers no, prison yes.
1102 2018-11-21 22:47:32 Their oil sovereign wealth fund and their fish would be nice too
1103 2018-11-21 22:47:29 Great patriots don't try and bait the president into global collapse of oil markets.....#flakeasshole
1104 2018-11-21 22:47:27 This tweet is basically insinuating that the prices are set at a national level. So basically if Saudi Arabia (which produces 3x the oil) raises prices Canada will continue to export at the same price. This is just stupid.
1105 2018-11-21 22:47:25 Fascist pinhead. We survived oil prices twice what they are now.
1106 2018-11-21 22:47:19 Peanut oil is best. Thaw the bird, inject with seasoning (buy a kit a kit your 1st time) Massage & let it sit at least 1hr. Heat oil to 350, put the bird in slowly. Cook 3 min per lb for small birds, 4 min for birds over 14. Sprinkle your fav seasoning all over when it's done
1107 2018-11-21 22:47:17 I agree, it is necessary to resort to new technologies and alternative energies. The oil will not last forever.

1110 2018-11-21 22:47:14 J Paul Getty's secret for success: "Rise early. Work hard. Strike oil."
1111 2018-11-21 22:47:14 Ah we get about 11% of our oil from Saudi Arabia so what are they really doing for you to ignore them murdering a journalist living in the US and working for an American paper? And don’t forget that most of the 9/11 high jackers where Saudi’s
1112 2018-11-21 22:47:12 But we don’t get most of our oil from them!! Sellout, literally sold out a human and justice! Appalling and sick!
1113 2018-11-21 22:47:02 And btw, I’ve been using cocoa butter lotion on my lips because they always suffer in cold months and it’s been working great. I also don’t trust lip balm, they always have peppermint oil n shit in it
1114 2018-11-21 22:46:58 So Trump thinks oil is worth more than a man's life, worth more than the love of a person's family and friends. He's just a sick deranged syphilis infected pig puke slurping scum bag cockroach in the body of a human,
1115 2018-11-21 22:46:58 Canadian oil and hydro electricity pretty much keep the eastern seaboard running. Until Trump learns what ethics are, we should cease all exports of crude oil and electricity to the US Or charge them the Fair Market Value.
The Orange Clown can go to hell.
1116 2018-11-21 22:46:51 2nd - If you truly want “American First” policies, where US has less reliance on Middle East oil, and is a net exporter of energy, we want the price to by higher, not lower.
1117 2018-11-21 22:46:48 2/ Defending Canada means defending those things even when oil companies don't want us to.

Defending oil is just that - defending oil.

Defending Canada is something quite different.
1118 2018-11-21 22:46:48 これが私の解釈
1119 2018-11-21 22:46:39 use olive oil instead uwu
1120 2018-11-21 22:46:39 Did you forget we get most of our oil from this hemisphere?? And I’m pretty sure you’re all artificially lowering the oil prices to sink Venezuela. So let’s be honest here.
1121 2018-11-21 22:46:33 one time i hooked up with this guy and he poured baby oil all over me.
1122 2018-11-21 22:46:32 So you are willing to trade low oil prices for human lives. Not surprising.
1123 2018-11-21 22:46:30 I'm reminded of the Beavis and Butthead episode where they strike "oil" in their backyard.
1124 2018-11-21 22:46:24 You know she has absolutely NO control over the price of oil right?
1125 2018-11-21 22:46:10 3 So US exports seem to be irrelevant since the US doesn't need to export if they are going to use it all themselves and US imports have shown to not be affected by the oil price. The only thing that could get damaged is the oil industries income but that wouldn't affect the rest
1126 2018-11-21 22:46:05 Just found out there's palm oil in Nutella. Gutted. Chrismas is RUINED.
1127 2018-11-21 22:45:57 Why are gas prices at the highest in a long time, if Saudi is holding oil prices down, which trump says is the reason he won’t hold that murdering Saudi Prince responsible for the murder of an innocent reporter?  Disgusting liar!

1129 2018-11-21 22:45:50 Fact! It's all about the oil!! And the rebuilding of a country! Which America is the only country that bombs a country then has private contractors rebuild it! Trivia?. Who owns the company that's rebuilding Iraq?
1130 2018-11-21 22:45:42 Markets rebounded overnight, lead by a bounce in Oil, going in to the big US holiday of Thanksgiving. The US/China Trade war continues on, which hits all trade exposed nations, while rising US interest rates curtail investment and growth. #marketnews #cfgglobal #mingyuan
1131 2018-11-21 22:45:42 I would too except we apparently have more oil in the US. What up with that?
1132 2018-11-21 22:45:38 1/ That's one of the stupidest things we'll read on Twitter today.

Oil, gas, mining and quarrying COMBINED are under 15% of our exports, under 10% of our GDP.

It's not worth rushing environmental reviews or consultations with First Nations, or violating the constitution.
1133 2018-11-21 22:45:37 she sounds like if I filled my washing machine with motor oil and pebbles 

she cute tho
1134 2018-11-21 22:45:35 He's losing daily. His latest tirade about oil prices won't help his cause with those voting in oil country. He wants to kiss the Saudis ass and thank them on Thanksgiving, while fucking the shale companies by giving Iran a clear path to sell their oil despite sanctions. #weary
1135 2018-11-21 22:45:34 I don't think Australia needs nuclear power - we have plenty of coal, oil n gas reserves. Should we take on nuclear-waste storage a nuclear plant might be useful...? 
Re the power supply, renewables are rubbish: high costs (~all going overseas to China etc) for low output.

1137 2018-11-21 22:45:08 I disagree with you because unity is not by force and as such Nigeria must not be/remain one. Therefore the ethnic nationalities that make up Nigeria must be allowed to exercise their right of self determination. We all know why 'One Nigeria' is important to you guys(Oil & Gas).
1138 2018-11-21 22:45:07 Let me get this straight. Murder is justified IN YOUR MIND to possibly keep oil prices down. Jesus. You are horrible.

1140 2018-11-21 22:45:06 Look at who is advertising on every mainstream media outlet. Health insurers, Defense contractors, oil drillers, and labor exploiters, none of whom maintain their power if the movement achieves critical mass. The blackout is REAL.
1141 2018-11-21 22:44:55 Canada actually supplies more gas, oil and natural gas to the US than Saudi Arabia. A lot more and we can continue to supply it without you having to use Saudi Arabia.
1142 2018-11-21 22:44:46 Big oil companies have known about the threat to climate posed by use of fossil fuels and have lied to the public for 30-40 years to protect their business  says environmentalist Bill McKibben

1145 2018-11-21 22:44:35 There are two main steps to tackle the #ClimateBreakdown #ClimateChange 

1. We need to cut down production of oil, gas and coal #KeepItInTheGround

2. Build up a society without fossil fuels

Just now we try to climb directly on step 2 without to touch step 1!
1146 2018-11-21 22:44:35 @IcelandFoods palm oil is unethical? But selling all the meat you do? What about the chemical products you sell which have been used and tested on monkeys? Hypocrites
1147 2018-11-21 22:44:30 It is actually the increasing American stockpile of oil that has increased supply and drove prices down. Trump is an idiot.
1148 2018-11-21 22:44:23 In the mean time let the ISIS oil trade flourish
1149 2018-11-21 22:44:21 2the shale industry a push also other alternative energy sources. I also don't see how the global oil price affect US export since the US consumes almost everything it produces. Its even illegal for all states except Alaska to export oil without the federal government permission
1150 2018-11-21 22:44:17 Using low oil prices to justify the murder and dismemberment of a journalist is completely despicable. A real president would hold them accountable.
1151 2018-11-21 22:44:15 Skin care routine for oily skin 
- Every other night I use a Yes To Tomatoes clay face mask for 15 minutes then I wash it off and apply the Neutrogena spf15 moisturizer (on these nights I skip the above step)

- I use Neutrogena oil wipes to get rid of extra oil on my face

1154 2018-11-21 22:44:10 Oil prices dropped because the stock market is tanking. The ME has a meeting scheduled to plan reductions in oil production to raise the price. Trump is giving them false credit so his cult will forget they are murderous dictators. He has as low an opinion of his cult as I do.
1155 2018-11-21 22:44:06 Your lil air bubble shouldn’t be moving inside the cartridge. THATS HOW YOU KNOW ITS TRASH. It’s oil and wax, not juice. Doesn’t it make you curious???
1156 2018-11-21 22:44:05 Domestic producers, meet the man you thought would make  great economics for you through  regulatory easing. You get the man who wants to open up imports instead. Turns out gambling with politics based on your wallet may come up snake eyes. #energy #oil #NaturalGas @POTUS

1158 2018-11-21 22:44:02 Yeah, not everything infuses well— it works best with things with a lot of oil in them, which is why citrus works so nicely.  12 dried mission figs (you can use other kinds but mission gets you the prettiest color) in 750ml vodka for 48 hours!
1159 2018-11-21 22:44:01 Due to technology & effort, shale oil and fracking are expensive (have a high cost per barrel).

They are only profitable when oil is at a certain expense level.

Saudi oil is extremely cheap (right under the sand) and they have a massive surplus that can stabilize world markets

1164 2018-11-21 22:43:47 Won’t happen. Trump only like great climates and is the best at predicting bad weather. And the best at spending tax payers money and sucking Saudi Arabia’s big fat oil pipe. #SadMAGA
1165 2018-11-21 22:43:46 @realDonaldTrump you should be thanking Canada for low oil prices and we didn't slaughter a journalist. #KhashoggiMurder
1166 2018-11-21 22:43:45 So we have to be nice to Saudi Arabia though it carved a journalist, tortures women and is starving 14 million because of oil.

And we have to be mean to Canada, our actual largest source of oil, because of milk.
1167 2018-11-21 22:43:42 but nobody wants our trash oil and they can't get it anyways. So we sell it to the americans at dirt. quality, fucking, journalism.
1168 2018-11-21 22:43:41 @barthorg deserves WAY more recognition. His stuff is genuinely amazing and watching him grow as an artist is fucking great lol

1172 2018-11-21 22:43:18 Hey Mr. Pretend Businessman. Things like oil prices rise and fall on the basis of supply and demand - not the generosity of authoritarian regimes. Not expecting you to know much about that stuff, though, considering you didn’t know how to make money at a casino
1173 2018-11-21 22:43:10 Thinking of changing my name to "The Incorruptible Derrick" because these big oil and gas and corporate companies and their pawns make me sick because they're only driven by money
1174 2018-11-21 22:43:06 So math-wise, how many American citizens are we willing to have assassinated to get free oil?

1177 2018-11-21 22:42:59 It sounds like I know a lot more about the CJ system than you do. Here's the truth: most people that go to court do so only once. Most people that do provincial time do time only once. Most people that do federal time do so only once. Not politically useful to fearmongers, truth.

1186 2018-11-21 22:42:32 There is a glut of oil on the world market that shows no sign of drying up. And the massive increase of renewables far beyond what was predicted will only add downward pressure.

1188 2018-11-21 22:42:21 Another recession is by the corner as oil prices falls from $83/barrel to $54/barrel in just 1wk.

As Trump pushes hard on OPEC, we're going to be worse off cos the Buhari Administration's ineptitude to save & invest.

1189 2018-11-21 22:42:17 Apparently City put in a bid for like 80 million base with 10 million in bonuses. Barcelona would only do 60 and I dunno what anyone else offered. Either way they are spending that oil money
1190 2018-11-21 22:42:14 Chavez subsidized prices below the cost of production. When oil prices dropped they were no longer able to subsidize but the price controls remained, so production shut down. Not even beer or toilet paper because no one's allowed to charge what it costs to produce.
1191 2018-11-21 22:42:12 Wow, I now live in a country where violence and murder against reporters and journalists is good cause for loyal oil prices.  Seems like an un-American trade to me.
1192 2018-11-21 22:42:05 Yeah because they are losing money with low prices,  it will be a good time to buy some crude oil.  Just time it right.
1193 2018-11-21 22:42:05 Why isn't Syria making an oil deal with Russia? Problem solved
1194 2018-11-21 22:42:05 Very good idea I want to drink bottle of oil anyway N1
1195 2018-11-21 22:42:01 Really?  An old growth forest undergrowth like a wood burning stove?  That is he most laughable things I have heard.  It is political.  Why much like oil, trees are a commodity we sell. Loggers want you to believe fire is bad when it actually part of the forest cycle.

1197 2018-11-21 22:41:55 1I don't see how them changing the price of oil means America becomes dependent on them. SA tried to kill US oil back in 2016 by dumping oil in the market forcing the price to go down but not only did US oil survive (mostly thanks to superior tech ) but it also gave-

1200 2018-11-21 22:41:43 What justice? Sanctions? Stop helping them commit genocide in Yemen? Call off all trade agreements? Can we function without Saudi oil? Perhaps someday....they will succeed at functioning without their oil before we do. We must work harder at advancing the science of renewables...
1201 2018-11-21 22:41:40 Fact: Canada is US biggest supplier of imported oil at 40 per cent , Saudi Arabia 11per cent.    Trump and his own FAKE NEWS!!
1202 2018-11-21 22:41:39 44% of our oil comes in from Canada while only 11% comes from SA. Thank the Baaken oil shale field and Canada not the SOB’s that buy $50 million apartments in NYC.
1203 2018-11-21 22:41:36 Why is TRUMP thanking the Saudis for lower oil prices after they kill a man, that worked and lived in the U.S.? This horror show has got to end.
1204 2018-11-21 22:41:31 Trump has sanctioned the murder of a US based journalist and the religious right hasn’t uttered a word.  Guess Jesus values lower oil prices over a human being.
1205 2018-11-21 22:41:29 Mr. President, is the goal to destroy domestic production. Doesn't fracking require $50 a barrel? Why aren't we maximizing domestic production and building new refineries away from the coast and weaning ourselves off of foreign oil entirely? That is putting America first. Thx
1206 2018-11-21 22:41:26 I had one of those a couple years ago when I went to Arizona.. their oil was ollllddddddd.... my cousins were like its normal... no sis...

1210 2018-11-21 22:41:17 We get much more oil from Canada. The Saudi business that Trump doesn’t want to lose is their investments in his properties.
1211 2018-11-21 22:41:16 結構気をつけてたはずだったんですけどね〜〜。。。ありがとうございます。。。！！
1212 2018-11-21 22:41:14 Take notes. I'm about to school you. 
Today Obama volunteered at a food bank and spread love. Trump cried about a female comedian being mean to him a year ago.

It may serve you best to, idk, wake up to who the real little bitch is. 
You re welcome
1213 2018-11-21 22:41:11 The US gets only 11% of oil from Saudi Arabia. It gets most of its oil from Canada and Mexico.
1214 2018-11-21 22:41:10 We have lots of refineries and export primarily finished petroleum products.  Saudi oil is particularly clean and easy to refine.

Secondly our exports are in part to ensure the needs of allies, Japan in particular.
1215 2018-11-21 22:41:08 ありがちゅ！！
1216 2018-11-21 22:41:03 Still need some lump charcoal for your smoker or oil or deepfryer?
We have BGE, Rockwood, Wicked Good, Cowboy, & B&B-still left!
1217 2018-11-21 22:40:49 Blackseed oil is sooooooooo good honestly..
1218 2018-11-21 22:40:47 and then ran the oil infrastructure into the ground
1219 2018-11-21 22:40:46 Let oil price be lower in China.
1220 2018-11-21 22:40:44 before we get to oil painting tonight, i must completely consume the comics that I have acquired from my Local Comic Shop @VelocityComics this past saturday. Lots of Marvel Spider-books and Boom Studios Power Rangers
1221 2018-11-21 22:40:37 In Jesus name i'm not ready to accept this OG award..    i'm still young and fresh like Hardough Bread brought in on a wednesday dripping in finesse and hot oil.  

#dontcallmeog #thelordjuststarted
1222 2018-11-21 22:40:32 Thank you! Truth talking here. Actually WAY MORE oil! Wonder how many bleating sheep media outlets like FOX will actually call the lying SOB on this?
1223 2018-11-21 22:40:30 We should have realised after the 1970s oil shock, that the price of oil environmentally and politically, as well as financially, was too high; we have wasted 50 years
1224 2018-11-21 22:40:27 What scientific degree does Ken Ham have?  He is a huckster. A snake oil salesman. A showman. A liar who lies to indoctrinated fools about Jesus so that he can make money. The problem is, none of you know he’s lying. Nor does he.
1225 2018-11-21 22:40:22 Because opponents of oil & gas development like @RachelNotley actively block access to tidewater?
1226 2018-11-21 22:40:18 I've heard about them "considering" banning handguns, obviously intended to mollify and be forgotten. Stop smacking your head and expand your media diet.

1231 2018-11-21 22:40:03 Are we though? Haven’t we killed hundreds of thousands of people to protect our oil interests (including, I’m guessing, dozens of reporters)?
1232 2018-11-21 22:40:02 “Trump thanks Saudis for lower oil prices amid calls to punish crown prince”

#ClownPrince gives the #CrownPrince a get-away-with-murder pass.

Uh huh.  No kickbacks nor blowjobs involved there.
1233 2018-11-21 22:39:56 This year I’m thankful that I have a job so that I can pay for my car to have the oil leak repaired, even if it does cost me 2/3rds of my paycheck. And yes that is 2/3rds of the amount of an Oklahoma teacher paycheck so just let that sink in...
1234 2018-11-21 22:39:42 Yea.. over time will cause lifter problems.. the AFM (active fuel management) lifters are controled by oil pressure and when the ecm commands the cylinders to be “off” the lifted also collapses to help shut down the cylinder and over time those lifters get stuck collapsed
1235 2018-11-21 22:39:39 Hiw about peanut oil for the guy who didn’t measure correctly? (Coulda used that one time - thanks to CVS being open on Christmas I made it work)
1236 2018-11-21 22:39:38 Oil is too cheap already.
1237 2018-11-21 22:39:27 Why are you spreading more #FAKENEWS
Shouldn’t I believe Trump’s tweet that oil prices Lower?
What?  #Trumplies
Oil prices getting lower. Great! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World. Enjoy! $54, was just $82. Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let’s go lower!
1238 2018-11-21 22:39:24 Actually you’re wrong shocking eh. We import 40% of our oil from Canada and only 11% from KSA as this isn’t the 70’s any more. There’s no jobs coming from this arms deal which is valued at $12 billion not $405 billion and no contracts have been signed. That was an easy fix.
1239 2018-11-21 22:39:24 my sister used OIL as her mouth wash sisvsksfsk IM SOOOO DONE
1240 2018-11-21 22:39:22 anyone know a good oil change place that uses Valvoline oil?
1241 2018-11-21 22:39:19 Interest rate!!! Get it as low as possible it really makes a difference and the end total cost of the car. Also if they offer free roadside assistance, oil changes, and other benefits
1242 2018-11-21 22:39:18 Avenge Khashoggi, you dirtbag! We don’t get that much oil from SA!
1243 2018-11-21 22:39:14 3.5 minutes per pound. Peanut oil
1244 2018-11-21 22:39:04 おつかれさまです。。。がんばってね。。。！
1245 2018-11-21 22:39:00 Spilled half of my lavender oil on my bed so either I’ll be really relaxed or really dead by morning
1246 2018-11-21 22:38:53 I just had to use an oil filter wrench and a strap wrench to open a jar of sauerkraut for my wife.  Is this what it's like to be 40?
1247 2018-11-21 22:38:51 Yes, please keep killing people without the fear of any consequence.   If you get the oil prices down to $15, ...... I can make a terrible statement here but I'll let you continue to do that.
1248 2018-11-21 22:38:42 God dey change demma engine oil so e delay
1249 2018-11-21 22:38:37 First, oil prices are a worldwide commodity, and prices are set by the market. As a capitalist, you should know that. 
Second, Canada supplies 40% of US imported oil%, compared to only 11% for Saudi Arabia. But no shout-out to our northern neighbor and closest ally. SMH 
1250 2018-11-21 22:38:37 Blood price for the oil gods!
1251 2018-11-21 22:38:28 Most of our oil comes from Canada fool maybe you should learn that
1252 2018-11-21 22:38:22 @realDonaldTrump We Americans don't want blood money, blood oil, or blood created jobs. We Americans have morals and values, we condemn Saudi Arabia and are horrified by the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, RIP.
1253 2018-11-21 22:38:18 So, every time we sacrifice a journalist the price of oil goes down. Can’t sign up for that
1254 2018-11-21 22:38:16 President Trump  You alone got Saudi Arabia to lower their prices to the American People, and got them to do it. Our Navy is protecting S/A oil rich Nation for years, with zero payback! Now MSM & Obamaare going to take credit for it saying they started to bring down prices
1255 2018-11-21 22:38:15 That’s a toss up. Who has more billionaires? Who has more money invested? Isn’t Saudis money legit oil money? Russia money is dirty and needs to be laundered.
1256 2018-11-21 22:38:14 Scotch tape sales are currently booming in Edmonton as Oiler fans run to the shredder waste bin to tape back together their 201/19 stanley cup parade itineraries.
1257 2018-11-21 22:38:11 Courts need to stop making it so easy.
1258 2018-11-21 22:37:56 Of course 40% of US imported oil is Canadian and only 11% Saudi.
He should be thanking Canada and putting sanctions on Saudis
1259 2018-11-21 22:37:54 Would your reaction be the same if the murdered #Khashoggi worked for #Foxsnooze?

Would you side with your loyal business partners in #SaudiArabia or the loyal #FakeNews outlet?

BTW, you do know we get more oil from #Canada, right? It would #BeBest you be nicer to #Canadians.
1260 2018-11-21 22:37:37 Oil glut. We don’t need them for cheap gas prices. Shame on you.
1261 2018-11-21 22:37:26 Nothing like leveraging the death of a us person for lower oil prices...
1262 2018-11-21 22:37:26 You can't do without them, they love your weapons and you love their oil.
1263 2018-11-21 22:37:26 Tech dominates, for sure. Still, I would b likelier to invest in an oil well under a Pres dedicated to reviving the dirtiest forms of fossil fuels than a Pres who promises to steadily squash fossil fuel usage and denies permits for high-profile infrastructure
1264 2018-11-21 22:37:24 投票する余地すらなかった
1265 2018-11-21 22:37:22 And maybe a limb drenched in oil.
1266 2018-11-21 22:37:20 So do low oil prices justify murder?
1267 2018-11-21 22:37:16 Don’t think that matters if anything it’s about the oil.
1268 2018-11-21 22:37:10 So let's see, letting Dr Bone Saw get away with murder is a good thing because oil prices are lower so what would happen if you were murdered and cut in to little pieces? Maybe tarrifs would get lifted competitive trade would resume and the whole world would feel better.

1274 2018-11-21 22:36:50 Trump who lied about what the Finnish Pres said to him RE fires.
Lies about keeping oil prices low.
Lies about the Saudi deal.
Lies about the CIA's assessment RE Khashoggi.
Lies about the SS telling him he couldn't go the US cemetery etc

HE is going to tell us who we can trust?
1275 2018-11-21 22:36:47 U gotta put a little olive oil in there to prevent that but yeah it's not good to me
1276 2018-11-21 22:36:47 Fracking wells need 70$ oil to break even,  This kills them and makes it so they won't go for more wells, as there is no capital to do so,  It hurts the USA companies, but SA can't sustain their spending on cheap oil either. Ouch, in both countries, donnie is clueless again

1279 2018-11-21 22:36:28 You are getting played!!! This is the result of the trade tensions being squeazed by Trump's trade wars. Trump won't give Canada a good price for oil, because he's in bed with Saudi Arabia. #baddeal #abpoli #cdnpoli

the southerners do pronounce 'oil' as 'ol'
heard that alla way trough the gulf spill coverage..
1283 2018-11-21 22:36:15 Why don't you cut ties and use the American reserves we can get oil seems you are protecting your interests

1285 2018-11-21 22:36:13 @cathmckenna @JamesMoore_org @Stockwell_Day @kinsellawarren @gmbutts @JustinTrudeau respectfully can someone explain why we have such an aversion to building an oil refinery in the west. I understand it is expensive but wouldn’t it provide for enhanced trade
1286 2018-11-21 22:36:12 No pyting for me  I’ll rather drink castor oil
1287 2018-11-21 22:36:07 Actually, the federal government’s carbon initiatives have post-dated those of AB, which have been used to assist the oil sands in reducing its carbon footprint. You’ve got your jurisdctions confused.
1288 2018-11-21 22:36:07 Yes but Saudia Arabia contributes to the world markets more than Canada thus helping with world supply and setting the price. Where the actual oil comes from makes no difference really.
1289 2018-11-21 22:35:55 How ignorant can a president be? You don’t have to work in government to know that US dependence on Middle East oil has dropped since Obama era and Saudi Arabia’s influence on OPEC are basically for gains to satisfy producing states not the United States.
1290 2018-11-21 22:35:54 Thanks!  Q:  With so much FREE ENERGY of sorts that is suppose to be coming, why has Trump been pushing OIL & GAS & COAL?  Reconcile.
1291 2018-11-21 22:35:52 Honestly even since the start I always thought Todd as a snake oil salesman. He promises the world and always, always, under delivers

1296 2018-11-21 22:35:34 We can have them borrowing money for things that benefit most Canadians or we can have you lot borrowing money to pay for tax cuts of which more than 90% go to multinationals and the very rich. Since you'll both run deficits I'll take the choice that helps most Canadians.
1297 2018-11-21 22:35:24 Saudi doesnt control oil

1302 2018-11-21 22:35:13 Canada 40% oil to US. 
Saudi Arabia 9% oil to US. 
enough said.
1303 2018-11-21 22:35:09 I would also be willing to pay more if the USA eliminated all subsided to oil companies.

1307 2018-11-21 22:34:47 They provide 12% of our oil. Canada supplies nearly 4x that amount. Thanks, Canada!

The "Scottish" Labour party hid the McCrone report, rigged the 79 devolution referendum, stood with the Tories to oppose it, remained silent while Thatcher decimated Scotland and stole the oil, Campaigned with and were funded by the Tories to oppose independence.
1309 2018-11-21 22:34:40 Trump tweeted earlier price of oil per barrel was $82, now $54
1310 2018-11-21 22:34:32 Unilateral determination of constitutionality is not within the powers here.

1319 2018-11-21 22:33:56 Ummm. What was the price of oil in January 2017, about $53/bbl?
1320 2018-11-21 22:33:55 If you accept the murder of a US resident in exchange for Saudi oil DT, you have blood on your hands. Anyone who fails to call you out on this has blood on their hands as well. We must never trade freedom of the press for oil, or anything else.

1322 2018-11-21 22:33:48 The nerve this arsehole has got to post this especially the praise for Saudi Arabia. Pretty much says that I struck a deal so that we wont make a fuss about you politically assassinating your people if you give us some cheap oil for a bit.
1323 2018-11-21 22:33:47 No biggy, my dude. Enjoyed drawing him!
1324 2018-11-21 22:33:35 Coming out of the summer some of the US highly valued markets were due a fall!  Nasdaq still looking ominously toppy but oil is key commodity so has value somewhere soon.
1325 2018-11-21 22:33:31 Fair Comment. Write off /deduction incentives will benefit firms in energy sector. Perhaps should have said, measures specific to helping oil sector cope with discount
1326 2018-11-21 22:33:26 @BullsBearsFBN tell whole story btw Trump and Saudia Arabia Trump was to install stringent sanctions then exempts Iran’s oil sales to its customers!
1327 2018-11-21 22:33:21 How much of the world’s oil supply does Jim Acosta produce? Can he destabilize the entire Middle East?
1328 2018-11-21 22:33:17 Fact: Saudi Arabia is only responsible for 11% of global oil exports.

Fact: Last week, Saudi Arabia announced that it would be cutting production to boost prices.
1329 2018-11-21 22:33:16 I think what you meant to say was "MONEY FIRST!" because if you really put America first you'd be working on breaking our reliance on Saudi money and oil instead of rolling over and continuing to be the Saudi's bitch.
1330 2018-11-21 22:33:15 We continue to reassess the security situation there to see if the request for exemption of land-based oil workers can be accommodated. Embassy Chargé d’Affaires Melicor is now enroute to Manila for consultations on this matter.
1331 2018-11-21 22:33:05 Dear President Trump,with all the agencies under your authority, tell us whether the crown prince was directly involved in the assasination.Yes or no? Second, the most important product for the US economy is the values of human rights and not the oil

1333 2018-11-21 22:32:56 @maddow @chrislhayes Has anyone ever analyzed the Texan economy to see how much of it is actually subsidized by the government? Between oil tax breaks, NASA and military bases, is anything untouched by gov't cash?
1334 2018-11-21 22:32:55 Here’s the thing about that ‘thanks, Saudi Arabia!’ tweet: they’re extremely likely to cut oil production soon. The only reason OPEC hasn’t already cut production is that the administration said it wouldn’t grant any Iran sanctions waivers - and then granted the waivers.
1335 2018-11-21 22:32:54 You mean like the oil industry, the auto industry, and all those other corporate conservative whiners who get tons of gov't money?
1336 2018-11-21 22:32:51 At it pertains to their oil anyway.
1337 2018-11-21 22:32:49 Hey, dude. I don't insult you. Our civilization that has made more progress than yours without the source of oil revenue. We've managed you for a long time. All of this are friendly advices. You can answer me for hours on end.

1341 2018-11-21 22:32:39 I don’t understand why trump thinks a small drop in the oil price is a good thing and the Crown Prince deserves thanks when he has been active in cutting oil production from OPEC when Iran’s oil is no longer available
1342 2018-11-21 22:32:38 I need a fcking oil change bod bod
1343 2018-11-21 22:32:33 No, he was actually upset I wasn't making them 2 ways this year. I've had some vegetarian friends over in the past and I shred them and a quick saute in olive oil and finish with lemon juice. There are so many hours in a day..
1344 2018-11-21 22:32:33 This weekend at Saddleback: Pastor Rick returns after surgery to teach “HOW TO PRAY WHEN YOU’RE IN PAIN.” Are you in pain? Receive a personal, individual prayer & anointing with oil at end of this special service. Bring anyone who is hurting. #HealingJames5:13-16
1345 2018-11-21 22:32:29 Says the great American president who conveniently overlooks Saudia Arabia state instigated murder and instead thanks them for lowering their oil price.
1346 2018-11-21 22:32:25 in your haste to complain and pick bone on POTUS, you had ignored the fact that how the major oil producers work. And how the oil price was influenced.
1347 2018-11-21 22:32:24 Wait a minute. Low oil prices are a tax-cut for Americans?  
What are high steel prices then?  A tax-increase on americans?  

#MAGA’d the shit outa that one Donald.
1348 2018-11-21 22:32:23 Ummm, you may not actually know this @realDonaldTrump , but only a small portion of our oil comes from Saudi Arabia.  Try to not piss off Canada so much, eh?
1349 2018-11-21 22:32:21 Guess Liverpool will be sending back that oil money from PSG via Barca for Coutinho then. Yeah...except they won't. You're club is involved and gets money from "oil clubs" so they are "dirty" as well.
1350 2018-11-21 22:32:20 It was alil infused coconut oil
1351 2018-11-21 22:32:20 @shanedawson chapped lips cure!! Try some coconut oil on them before bed!
1352 2018-11-21 22:32:20 Us is CLOSE TO importing ZERO Oil from Saudis
Get up to speed !
1353 2018-11-21 22:32:13 furthur proof that you would truly destroy out country. See the problem is that it's ok to kill the problem is if we give consequences and the Saudi's and OPEC change oil trading to the Euro the value of the dollar will be comparable to the peso.
1354 2018-11-21 22:32:11 How would Canadian Petroleum Boards handle Saudi Arabia dropping the Petrodollar and increasing oil production?
1355 2018-11-21 22:32:07 @Plaid_Xi2 and I have preliminarily agreed to cooperate on oil and gas exploration
1356 2018-11-21 22:32:07 Russia have many oil  pipelines.
1357 2018-11-21 22:31:58 How do you crash the global economy - cut off from Saudi Arabia... no more SA oil. It’s a petro dollar so I think that would do it. So I wonder why certain people are trying to say Trump should do this? (Remember Kashogi?)
1358 2018-11-21 22:31:50 I haven’t used heat in YEARS and I decided to use Pantene shampoo for natural hair. I clipped my ends and found a new moisturizing oil because my scalp is so dry sometimes. But this one keeps it hydrated. I’m hoping it doesn’t stop.
1359 2018-11-21 22:31:39 Because iran don't want submission to usa empire. In 1953 cia do a coup against Mossadeq, not radical islamiat, because nationalizing oil. If dob't submit to empire you will destroy by empire. This is history
1360 2018-11-21 22:31:36 Actors should start to ask for tax breaks because - like oil companies - they can't count on making millions of dollars the next year. @jaketapper #Exxon @maddow @chrislhayes
1361 2018-11-21 22:31:26 いちろ~からサマの元を去っていったのにサマのことを越えたい壁だって意識してるの、いちろ~、そういうとこだよ
1362 2018-11-21 22:31:09 It is all relative. It is higher than before when Trump took over but it is cheaper than a few months ago. Of course a lot of that is the switch from more expensive environment safer gas to the other. My issue is the price of oil is about to go up and Trump will be silent.
1363 2018-11-21 22:30:55 Low oil prices equal a shitty deal for the economy over all. You know this, if it keeps up, enjoy the recession. Btw on behalf of Canada, (being your biggest supplier) get bent.
1364 2018-11-21 22:30:55 I care more about justice for Jamal Khashoggi than about oil prices.  Mr. President, what kind of people do you think we are?
1365 2018-11-21 22:30:50 But we need a better deal. To borrow orange guy's terms: U.S. taking advantage of Canada when it comes to oil and steel trades. 
1366 2018-11-21 22:30:48 Let us build a "wall" around our great nation and never ever communicate with any but those within that wall! This girl needs to read some history then figure it out. Know that China will purchase all the Saudi oil since she want to pay $6 a gallon. Economics baby!
1367 2018-11-21 22:30:48 I just drained and put some transmission oil into my car I am a bad! @Lucas_Oil
1368 2018-11-21 22:30:46 Hmmm...I wonder how US oil companies feel about this.

1371 2018-11-21 22:30:40 Fracking operators have stated that $60@barrel of oil is a break even level.
1372 2018-11-21 22:30:39 A couple more silly tweets will move all trading to RMB and EUR and the US will sail alone with oil at $150 if not $200 or more, while China pays €350 per MT. “shit happens mr P”

1374 2018-11-21 22:30:33 Is Trudeau going to stop doing business with KSA?
Is he going to stop buying their oil?
1375 2018-11-21 22:30:28 It is ridiculous, however, Sell weapons to wahabi fundamentalists & allow ourselves to be bent over an oil barrel it's hardly surprising they care little about repurcusions from a currently toothless Gvt.
1376 2018-11-21 22:30:21 If we would have followed the plan Obama set up we would be getting off of our oil addiction. Clean, less expensive energy and new jobs in the progress. Among other things the GOP is in a race with itself to fuck the planet for fun and profit.
1377 2018-11-21 22:30:20 Anyone tryna bring me food and a phone charger while I’m trapped getting an oil change
1378 2018-11-21 22:30:16 Thanks for cucking yourself to a theocratic monarchy that funds terrorists, slaughters Yemenis, and oppresses its people for lower oil prices.
1379 2018-11-21 22:30:06 This Texan knows bad oil prices means a bad economy. It is what it is
1380 2018-11-21 22:30:02 Why does it take so long to get an oil change
1381 2018-11-21 22:30:01 Exfoliate, use Vitamin E or bio oil everyday. Use Cocoa Butter to moisturize instead of lotion
1382 2018-11-21 22:29:48 And what's your opinion about #climatechange? Cheap oil means more gets burned, producing more GHG emissions which contributes to climate change #ottnews
1383 2018-11-21 22:29:47 I can’t believe I was just conned into a $77 oil change
1384 2018-11-21 22:29:46 いちろ~はサマのことを越えたい壁として認識してるけどサマはいちろ~のことを殺したい奴って認識してるからその認識の齟齬が二人のギスギスした関係を悪化させてる要因の一つなんじゃないかっておもう
1385 2018-11-21 22:29:34 I remember the second time I had a lone car accident, my mother came to the scene, talked a bit, dusted me off and sent me off to school. 

I went to class with oil stained clothes, I was moving like a ghost throughout the day.
1386 2018-11-21 22:29:32 Good: I remember the "Oil Shortage, of 1973" when I was a kid, and paying over $4.00 per gallon myself.
1387 2018-11-21 22:29:28 Saudis will hit you back harder by cutting oil production and jack up the prices because you lied to Crown Prince
1388 2018-11-21 22:29:22  can still do his song remains the same rant... "Oil leave you anytime"
1389 2018-11-21 22:29:22 Damn they take yo keys here when u get a oil change.
1390 2018-11-21 22:29:21 Also ask him what has a higher GHG emissions standard, Apple INC or an Oil Sands company? I bet he doesn’t know the answer!
1391 2018-11-21 22:29:14 The truth is, I really like @realDonaldTrump #DonaldTrump. He is painfully frank. He explicitly told us how America acts towards human rights violations. It weighs it in oil and money short gains, nothing more. America has always been this, & will always be this. #Khashoggi #USA
1392 2018-11-21 22:29:13 Thanks to Canada. 40% of our imported oil is from Canada, 11% from Saudi Arabia.
1393 2018-11-21 22:29:06 More to the point, Saudi Arabia is starting to panic, because of the beast they created in W. Texas.  Our oil fields can now weather OPEC price manipulations, and will be out producing them in 3-5 years.  They’re panicking- and deserve far, far more than a slap on the wrist.
1394 2018-11-21 22:28:57 It would be great to drive over a rainbow and get a free oil change
1395 2018-11-21 22:28:53 Tax cuts/oil prices--not comparable.

Do you think Saudi Arabia sets oil prices? That's not how it works at all.

And you know Saudi only supplies like 10% of our total comsumption, right?

There's this thing on the internet called Google. You can learn a lot of neato stuff.
1396 2018-11-21 22:28:49 That pussy juice is like beard oil.
1397 2018-11-21 22:28:44 If by pills you mean cod liver oil then yes, gotta get that omega 3
1398 2018-11-21 22:28:44 The war of choice was based on lies and botched from inception.  The US military may have overthrown a dictator, but they and the politicians did not think about anything beyond getting the oil secured.
1399 2018-11-21 22:28:43 I never heard #foxnews say that the US only gets 11% of its oil from Saudi Arabia, and we get 40% from Canada.
1400 2018-11-21 22:28:33 gotta pay for that oil and that labor. 

I've fried a turkey before. i think you need like a gallon of oil and that's like $25 in and or itself.
1401 2018-11-21 22:28:31 I was thinking more along the lines of the Niedermayer / Pahlsson / Moen line of the '07 Ducks!
1402 2018-11-21 22:28:30 Just got an oil change at the dealership & was told that someone tried to break into my truck when they discovered my driver-side door lock was “popped.”

Getting my truck detailed now and they just discovered a micro-chip in my wondshield.

Fun stuff! Lol
1403 2018-11-21 22:28:28 I did have an oil bath going

Oil prices getting lower. Great! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World. Enjoy! $54, was just $82. Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let’s go lower!
1405 2018-11-21 22:28:26 You only pay 2.60 a gallon?  We pay over 5....average here is 1.31/L.  Can be as much as 1.37. Or more.  And we make oil in Alberta!
1406 2018-11-21 22:28:25 Honestly I don't think he gives a shit about oil and arms. He care about the $ they put in his pocket. He is a purchased man.
1407 2018-11-21 22:28:23 Have you looked into how many gallons of surface drinking water it takes to produce a gallon of oil, to be forever polluted and pumped underground? Worth it? The US has become a robber baron economy again, and the only thing that matters is profit.
1408 2018-11-21 22:28:19 Because a war about oil interests sure has to do with freedom.
1409 2018-11-21 22:28:16 You just thanked the country that murdered & dismembered an American resident, were responsible for 9/11 & have promised to reduce oil output which will raise prices! Your a disgrace! You have no backbone!!!
1410 2018-11-21 22:28:14 Wasn’t oil at $45 barely under President Obama ?
1411 2018-11-21 22:28:12 No but we can certainly set an example. We could put sanctions on Saudi Arabia. We could reduce our dependance on oil to reduce Saudi influence on US politics. We could have elected an official who wasn't in bed with the crown prince. These are just off the top of my head
1412 2018-11-21 22:28:08 Lower prices mean larger layoffs in the oil and gas industries. Less people employed but maybe @realDonaldTrump can have the Saudi prince murder and dismember them so that the unemployment numbers won’t look so bad

1415 2018-11-21 22:28:04 No it’s not accurate, unless you ignore the cost of mining & manufacturing of LI batteries, the costs of recycling and electricity use to re-charge.

The only thing that is below ICE is energy use and only applies if energy source is clean energy, IE: not coal, LP gas or oil.
1416 2018-11-21 22:28:02 Oil change was due over 4 months ago 
1417 2018-11-21 22:28:01 Vaping hash oil in the airport bathroom and they’re playing my sooooong
1418 2018-11-21 22:27:49 I think the main concern is keeping the trade of oil in US dollars ( which helps keep the US dollar as the world reserve currency)... almost a year since there has been yuan based oil trading, but not within OPEC members
1419 2018-11-21 22:27:46 Oil thinks it’s a great idea to get my dogs comfy on my bed whilst I’m downstairs so when I come back in the won’t get off, I just want to sleep in my bed please !!!
1420 2018-11-21 22:27:45 The Saudi's orchestrated 911, manipulate oil prices. We have enough fracking and alternative energy sources to be totally independent if we choose but political contributions impede this.
1421 2018-11-21 22:27:43 We get more imported oil from Canada.   Read your briefing books.
1422 2018-11-21 22:27:43 Canadian oil represents 30% of US imports, Saudi just 11%... thank you Canada for my tax break!!
1423 2018-11-21 22:27:41 Dang I was been supposed to get a oil change  
1424 2018-11-21 22:27:35 Time to go make the olive oil marinade for the Brussel Sprouts ... then roasting 
1425 2018-11-21 22:27:34 I support Trump 100 % but he’s not helping out the oilfield in this country he’s hurting our money and our way of life with low oil prices Texas voted him in office and stood up for all republicans and he’s hurting the oilfield at Christmas time as well and Saudi Arabia sucks .
1426 2018-11-21 22:27:16 Tea Tree Oil Chew Sticks are awesome.
1427 2018-11-21 22:27:10 How was that snake oil business going?
1428 2018-11-21 22:27:07 Agreed. But the income drop per barrel for “Canadian” Oil is their doing by inaction to get the product to World Markets! No? In addition the Province is not welcoming investment- This has Absolutely Nothing to do with the Cons, has it?

1436 2018-11-21 22:26:51 @CNBCFastMoney with oil prices down for a long time, why haven’t airlines had better earnings? My guesses: poor management or rip off .. paying executives & management too much.
1437 2018-11-21 22:26:46 You and your 'big oil' mates need to change tack now, move away from fossils and invest your vast resources into zero carbon, renewable energies whilst repairing the damage you've caused over the past decades. Oh and an apology for your contribution to climate breakdown please!
1438 2018-11-21 22:26:46 It was empty land but oil was under the ground
1439 2018-11-21 22:26:45 What are the benefits of cbd oil?
1440 2018-11-21 22:26:38 It’s a rubbery/tar like substance so slippage probably isn’t an issue. 

I’d guess the issues are peeling off and, well, it turning black very soon from trash, dirt, oil, tire marks etc.

Sounds like a stupid waste of resources.  We shall see...
1441 2018-11-21 22:26:36 *rolls in a barrel of olive oil* ok dad
1442 2018-11-21 22:26:35 How’s that CBD oil working out for you enz??
1443 2018-11-21 22:26:34 Leaving it in the ground? I agree it's not an overnight thing. Need long term focus and investment on switching to #renewables rather than subsidising oil production which will always produce more spills
1444 2018-11-21 22:26:28 Our national tragedy exclaimed, as he pounds on about how we couldn’t ever make it as a country without Saudi Arabia’s blood and oil money
1445 2018-11-21 22:26:25 I don't think you get to take any actual moral. High ground while your country ILLEGALLY occupies and bombs Syria.

If Russia just dropped some troops into your country without permission right next to some oil fields, I think you'd kick up a fuss.
1446 2018-11-21 22:26:24 I wouldn’t let this guy change the oil on my car, let alone be acting AG.

JFC is this the Work-Release Administration?
1447 2018-11-21 22:26:11 Lolololol my father in law just claimed that “oil isn’t subsidized” lmaooooooo
1448 2018-11-21 22:26:09 #LittleDonnieDump thanking a murderer for oil prices.
1449 2018-11-21 22:26:00 In the '73 with the OPEC oil embargo, we knew that we needed to strive for energy independence which meant - get off fossil fuels. 45 years later we still have a president afraid of OPEC because we didn't do enough and they account for 33% of our imported petroleum.
1450 2018-11-21 22:25:57 1. They are certified 
2. Just wait a week or two, it’s oil it isn’t going to ruin your car if no service 
3. Girl put some gloves on and do it with your man as bonding time. Save some money.

1453 2018-11-21 22:25:46 I’ll get topless and rub oil and/or lotion on myself.  And sometimes I’ll use my lush and just keep panties on. Other than that I just tell everyone I won’t be getting naked for a couple days. And continue normal stuff

1455 2018-11-21 22:25:39 Clove oil dude!!
1456 2018-11-21 22:25:29 Who’s the oil cartridge plug
1457 2018-11-21 22:25:29 Oil money in Port Harcourt.
1458 2018-11-21 22:25:21 Is this why you & the @abndpcaucus deliberately set out to lower the price of WCS? Create a huge differential in order to attract petrochemical product investments taking advantage of our landlocked crude oil & natural gas?
1459 2018-11-21 22:25:19 Never done an electric. The thought of that much hot oil inside my house scares me. Plus, I can’t imagine the amount of power required to heat up and hold the oil at temp. But others do it an it works, so I’m sure it’s fine.
1460 2018-11-21 22:25:15 Gabe handed the oil to you.
1461 2018-11-21 22:25:14 Why not stop importing Saudi oil?
1462 2018-11-21 22:25:12 Day after fall economic update, Canada PM Trudeau to visit Calgary -- heart of country's oil patch -- to meet with energy leaders. Fall update didn't include targeted measures for energy sector dealing with historic discount on western Cdn select.

1464 2018-11-21 22:25:08 accidentally snorted coconut oil up my nose. bet not even the wellness vegans do that
1465 2018-11-21 22:25:02 Coconut oil is perfect for stopping skin drying out in colder months x
1466 2018-11-21 22:24:59 I wish someone would hack the RNC as well! But it doesn’t change the fact that both parties are corrupt as hell, and the DNC needs to get rid of corruption, corporate Dems (repub lite) Biden, Booker, HRC, Pelosi, Joe Manchin, etc..they all work for donors, big oil, bank, pharma
1467 2018-11-21 22:24:56 Responsible for the terrorists on 9-11, for butchering a WaPo reporter, and you thank them? How quick money makes you forget morality. And all for 11% of the oil we consume. You are a cheap whore.
1468 2018-11-21 22:24:52 America is one of the world's largest oil producers, and close to 40 percent of U.S. oil needs are met at home. The number one country we currently import oil from is Canada. Only around 11% is from Saudi Arabia.
1469 2018-11-21 22:24:49 Because he’s misleading well-meaning people. He’s trying to sucker in noobs so that he can sell them snake oil in the future. It’s the old FinTwit playbook, been done countless times. He literally said he wants to sell a book later on.
1470 2018-11-21 22:24:42 When will we stop buying anything from these 4th century lying barbarians?  Stop oil, stop immigration, close our embassies. Kick them to hell out of the Western Hemisphere.
1471 2018-11-21 22:24:41 Heck if it came out in the 90s it would have been pink fluro and renamed Dolphin and designed to mop up oil spills with it's anti pollution 'missiles'
1472 2018-11-21 22:24:37 Is he available to answer question about excessive oil consumption issues? A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONS!
1473 2018-11-21 22:24:37 Is a lower price of oil good for the economy?
1474 2018-11-21 22:24:31 We get between 9 and 11% of our oil from Saudi! What the hell are you actually thanking them for? Not effecting the price of oil, that's for sure!
1475 2018-11-21 22:24:29 Thanks dude
1476 2018-11-21 22:24:29 Same stupid fuckers that give 10% of their gross pay to ppl like Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell Jr., Joel Osteen and the rest of the snake oil salesmen that make up their pseudo-religion.
1477 2018-11-21 22:24:28 Finally you get it...it's all just business...those in the oil industry killed those inventions..

1479 2018-11-21 22:24:21 He;'s been a whore his entire life, except apparently when he's raping 13 year olds. @TulsiGabbard is spot on: oil for piglets isn't worth one human life. If the quality of our lives go down as a result, maybe it's a humbling step in the right direction.
1480 2018-11-21 22:24:20 look for oil prices to continue to drop as America will drill more in West Texas than ever before. This oilfield has enormous amounts of oil and gas.

1483 2018-11-21 22:24:17 Nice to know you believe an organisation with its accusations in child abuse, financial corruption, oil for food fiasco and anti semitism. Pleased to hear you don’t support its faux pas in war though.
1484 2018-11-21 22:24:09 *adds juuuuust enough salt and a dash of pepper* And now olive oil.
1485 2018-11-21 22:24:09 The palm oil debate is a mess. We've known for years how damaging palm oil is but the alternatives are worse. There are also arguements to suggest that sustainable palm oil isn't that sustainable either. Basically, humans are the problem and there is not much we can do about it.
1486 2018-11-21 22:24:01 We don't need ANY oil from that terrorist state Saudi Arabia, we have something called the Permian Basin here in America . . . SMH
1487 2018-11-21 22:23:53 Trump tries to undermine efforts to mitigate climate change through turning away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy . . .
 
. . . then he says we have to let the Saudi government violate human rights and take innocent lives, because we need their oil.
1488 2018-11-21 22:23:51 The tweet was a reference to the killing of Khashoggi, a journalist, by the Saudi prince, and Trump giving no reprimands because they’re giving us a good deal on oil, all while questioning Khashoggi’s character despite the CIA’s definite brief
1489 2018-11-21 22:23:41 Oil prices still the same as the last few months! Still price at pump is HIGH! Hope to see the effect of $54 soon!

1492 2018-11-21 22:23:37 What's the matter? Can't crow about the stock market - which you have nothing to do with - so now you're crowing about oil prices - which you also have nothing to do with?  You need to get outside on your taxpayer trip to Mar-a-Lago and stop watching Fox News, you ignorant swine.
1493 2018-11-21 22:23:35 You are being extremely naive: Many sources link #SaudiArabia & #Qatar to #ISIS.
Saudis also teach #Wahabism - A very intolerant brand of #Islam. 
US like Saudis because of #oil & a market for arms. 
@tbgstephen @crypt_ghost
1494 2018-11-21 22:23:31 And just so you know, #Syria destruction plan was put in place after #Israel and big name international conglomerates found the biggest reserves of oil in Golan Heights.
Who would Assad “given up power” to in ur openion?  
How come ur plan didn’t work in #Libya then? slavemarkets

1496 2018-11-21 22:23:29 Someone confirmed that Trump was right - whatever comments he made at the time. (Just like he was about the caravan). The oil changed the climate? CA Fires every year + ppl keep building in the same areas. Not logical. The Only 'proof' of Global Warming is a Model on a Computer.
1497 2018-11-21 22:23:26 Hey, Kris. I came down to thank you for your Bulletproof trigs+apob+ldl article. It's my case. My Bulletproof's moderate: 1 tpsb heavy cream + 1 coconut oil. My total col. went from 200 to 511. Ldl, apob and trigs went nuts. Your text was the answer. I'll definitely follow you.
1498 2018-11-21 22:23:23 Perhaps it is time for Canada to raise the price of the oil which the U.S. is purchasing from us.
1499 2018-11-21 22:23:22 What are you going to do to get our oil to market
1500 2018-11-21 22:23:18 Massage oil and some candles.
1501 2018-11-21 22:23:14 Oil change.  Then I secure the Chicken
1502 2018-11-21 22:23:13 @realDonaldTrump  Your right on Saudi Arabia! Don’t let these dems & Rhinos cause OPEC to stop producing oil. If the Saudi government was behind it so be it. Don’t cost American taxpayers billions over an antagonist journalist. We can’t stop American progress over this!
1503 2018-11-21 22:23:08 Those turkey fryer videos show you how dangerous it can be to violently slam a turkey into a cauldron of oil using a long fiberglass pole.
1504 2018-11-21 22:23:02 How is the King going to buy some real estate from you if oil prices keep falling?  This could be very SAD for you, Donny!
1505 2018-11-21 22:22:58 nah dude you don't get it, they're actually super convenient. you just have to spend three hours doing a six-step seasoning process in order to develop a natural non-stick coating. now you have to be sure to use a neutral oil with a high smoke point. i prefer to use a blend of
1506 2018-11-21 22:22:55 I already finished watching the video before you reupload it
1507 2018-11-21 22:22:55 @TulsiGabbard, Who voted for you?    You are a disgrace.  What example are you leading by using such language?  Also, Saudi has 25% of oil reserves and we need oil to be lower.  You fight Saudi right now and we the poor people have to pay for your mistake.  Thank God for Trump
1508 2018-11-21 22:22:53 @HMajd @tparsi How can a nation that has oil suffer from hunger!?
1509 2018-11-21 22:22:52 Protecting allies and their oil reserves and stopping the spread of communism respectively. The reason it's political no is because they're not actually doing anything. Most aren't even stationed close to the border. It's a complete waste of money and time.
1510 2018-11-21 22:22:46 I found some body wash that has coconut oil and coffee and I was smelling and some lil old man goes “don’t drink that “
1511 2018-11-21 22:22:40 Oil & gas is the most corrupt sector on the planet. 
Phase it out.
1512 2018-11-21 22:22:35 The disinformation campaign is also well documented.

So these days even major oil companies have been admitting in court that AGW is correct.
So now they're trying to argue that 30 years ago they still had enough reasonable doubt to justify not mentioning it to stock holders

1517 2018-11-21 22:22:07 @CStokescbc Great job on reporting impact of oil spill on seabirds. Excellent analogy with shaking up bottle of oil. One drop of oil on a seabird is a death sentence. Washing the bird not only removes the oil but also removes the birds own insulating oil from its oil glands.

1521 2018-11-21 22:22:02 Yes, you are right, but the proceeds will not be as big as from oil revenue & not much will be there for them to kill us trying to get there. Most of them will turn to armed robbery, which case they will die when caught.
1522 2018-11-21 22:21:59 trump's thank you to Saudi Arabia is a lie. We only buy 9% of our oil from them, Over 40% from Canada Our production of oil goes overseas. And the Moron wants it to go lower. Below $50 dollars a barrel and our oil companies produce at a loss. The art of the deal HUH trump

1526 2018-11-21 22:21:41 So, the USA started wars in 2 countries to establish military supremacy in the Middle East (power corrupts). We let our oil companies steal oil to sell at HUGE profits to countries like India and China, who got our manufacturing jobs, cuz they're starving for energy.

1528 2018-11-21 22:21:38 I'm pretty sure 40 % of American oil comes from Canada and 18 per cent from Saudis Arabia. Trumps just dozing up to SA. Must be a money thing.
1529 2018-11-21 22:21:36 It’s funny how Michelle runs to ‘like’ anything supportive of the palm oil industry and then runs to her other account ‘Orangutan Land Trust’ and gives a ‘like’ from that again

1531 2018-11-21 22:21:31 We tried that once..1953..Eisenhower...Operation Ajax

When we installed the Shah to bring back Iranian Gov control of the oil supply..

Worked until 1979..

And now we're dealing with the repercussions..

1538 2018-11-21 22:21:07 I have been a supporter of yours. But being from Louisiana low oil prices and oil from foreign countries is not in our best interest. Takes jobs from hardworking oil field people such as my family.I think this is one of the areas you should educate yourself more on respectfully.
1539 2018-11-21 22:21:00 But not our oil industry

1542 2018-11-21 22:20:52 Because your chart did nothing to change the the fact...I said oil price is higher now than when he took office. There was nothing in your chart that disputed that FACT.
1543 2018-11-21 22:20:42 Oil was 44.54 dollars a barrel Nov 15 2016
1544 2018-11-21 22:20:34 Last time I checked, industries receiving heavy government support or tax exemptions are rarely beholden to the government (oil, BBD, most small artists and businesses).

The orange shit gibbon hasn’t a clue!
1549 2018-11-21 22:20:14 What about our oil
1550 2018-11-21 22:20:13 THIS WHITE LADY ON THE TRAIN EMPTIED THE HUMMUS CONTAINER INTO AN OLIVE OIL CONTAINER AND IS EATING IT WITH A SPOON LIKE ITS SOUP. 
SHE COULDNT WAIT TO GET HOME TO DO MY CULTURE LIKE THAT 
1551 2018-11-21 22:20:11 PSA: it’s okay now for countries to slaughter journalists in cold blood just as long as they keep oil prices low.
1552 2018-11-21 22:20:08 I'll try to put this as simply as I can: 1) Oil drives the global economy, sanction & CO sky rockets. 2) Iran wants to nuke us and SA helps us keep them in check 3) People that have real jobs care about 1 & 2.
1553 2018-11-21 22:20:05 3. Fabric/clothes, oil, building material,rope & other uses I can't think of off top of my head. So it was already grown here but with the widespread ban on recreational hemp, this had an effect on industrial hemp also despite them being different. It's a crop, not a tree though.
1554 2018-11-21 22:20:04 We only import 11% of our oil from Saudi Arabia. Changes in oil prices take a long time to translate into lower prices for refined products. High cost fracking companies are not happy this news. This ain’t no tax cut.
1555 2018-11-21 22:19:57 This isn't to say nothing can be done mid-long term but its not about imports its about prices & swing producers. They have power on affecting the price of oil cos how much easy oil they have & how they play with output.
1556 2018-11-21 22:19:55 Hmmm, so let’s all keep this in our back pockets in case we ever have to kill someone, if we can somehow manage to lower the price of oil, or buy a ton of US produced arms, you can probably get the president to look the other way.
1557 2018-11-21 22:19:50 Oil prices are going down because the stock market is tanking, @realDonaldTrump. The reason is because investors are put off by all of your trade tariffs.
1558 2018-11-21 22:19:49 Trudeau must work harder in making the pipeline approval process in Canada much less uncertain or we wont have anyone, no one who will invest in our resources. One way or the other Alberta MUST get our oil to tidewater. Our future depends on it !!
1559 2018-11-21 22:19:40 The oil price was lower in 2015 & 2016 prior to your presidency.
It''s like a salesman saying theres a sale on when its going back to its normal price.
1560 2018-11-21 22:19:32 "Thank you to Saudi Arabia" !? Whaoo @realDonaldTrump, what a timing for this kind of statement, and it is not coincidental. It is as if nobody got slaughtered lately by this same country you are thanking now for lower Oil gas, really? Your behavior is despicable, shame on you!
1561 2018-11-21 22:19:29 Yes, by all means let’s keep the price of oil stupidly low so we have one more reason NOT to address global warming.  America First! Earth and our future Last!
1562 2018-11-21 22:19:16 Wow. So killing journalists is OK because cheaper oil? You're a disgusting maggot.
1563 2018-11-21 22:19:15 BOGO till midnight! Buy Copaiba for $35 (wholesale) And get a Deep Blue oil FREE!
1564 2018-11-21 22:19:10 DEMs are/were against oil drilling offshore and in ANWR, against fracking. Had we followed that program we'd be far more reliant on Saudis than we are now.  How would they have stood up to them?   #TheFive

1573 2018-11-21 22:18:46 the united states is the biggest oil producer, not SA. Murdering a journalist doesnt justify your refusal to hold SA accountable.
1574 2018-11-21 22:18:46 Saudia Arabia has been swindled out of their oil for years. Trump is correcting that wrong. Free trade!!!!
1575 2018-11-21 22:18:41 Should seem obvious but you’re “thanking” the WRONG country seeing how we get at least 40% of U.S. oil from Canada. So how is it that a country that contributes about 13% is lowering U.S. oil prices vs. our neighbors to the north?....I’ll wait

1581 2018-11-21 22:18:06 We have JP Getty to blame. He made the first deal with Saudi Arabia which began Getty Oil Company. And the deal was sealed.

1586 2018-11-21 22:17:48 Probably cost of production and the falling of oil prices over the last decade has also made such investments illogical. Its just business lol..

1589 2018-11-21 22:17:41 How much has the national average decreased? Since oil is so cheap.
1590 2018-11-21 22:17:41 We need less oil, less gas, & less coal and quickly. All fossil fuel use should be phased out in the rich north by 2025. How about running another poll with the option of ‘rapid cessation of fossil fuel use’?
1591 2018-11-21 22:17:37 We produce more oil than Saudi's do #TheMoreYouKnow
1592 2018-11-21 22:17:24 Remove the crude oil, politicians will look for another way to make the people pay them for their deserved needs
1593 2018-11-21 22:17:22 Baby oil
1594 2018-11-21 22:17:21 So your excuse for not going after your buddy is low oil prices. Yet you go after China, Mexico and Canada
1595 2018-11-21 22:17:19 How's 'your' sharemarket going @realDonaldTrump , still shit I see and getting shittier.......that drop in oil is really helping things....no really!
1596 2018-11-21 22:17:17 I can’t remember the brand but I got it at a hair store next to the small coconut oil bottles but they have them anywhere
1597 2018-11-21 22:17:12 We are using vegetable oil to prevent oxidative degradation of lipids, which leads to quality deterioration of foods. A major challenge is to develop tools to assess the antioxidant capacity and real efficacy of these molecules. Any Suggestions? @UofGFoodProf #Laguerre #Food2150
1598 2018-11-21 22:17:10 Trump needs them, they need him, both make money (lots). Oil price down in exchange for protecting MBS and the kingdom, the same who undercover is inflaming the mid-east w/undercover activities against Iran and the west (al quads, isis..). And trump makes more money
1599 2018-11-21 22:17:05 The secret... applesauce instead of oil
1600 2018-11-21 22:17:03 かな……
1601 2018-11-21 22:17:03 Once again, Fake News! Why is it fake? There not including the fact that NON OPEC countries (Canada et al) supplies 113,000K barrels of Crude Oil per month to US. OPEC (controlled by Saudis) supply 248,000K barrels of Crude oil per month to the US. They leave that part out!
1602 2018-11-21 22:16:59 Comrade trump, Mother Russia needs high oil prices.

1604 2018-11-21 22:16:56 What good does the UAE offer to the world? Corrupt money, corrupt princes, corrupt country. They're lucky they sit in oil fields, they'd be so irrelevant otherwise and nobody would give a shit about them.

1610 2018-11-21 22:16:35 Imperialists will bomb who they can, and trade with the rest for oil and profits. Trump does and says what the rest have done. 
To be shocked is to misread history. 
Instead we must support principled resistance inside USA and SA. 
#KhashoggiMurder
1611 2018-11-21 22:16:32 @potus' truth is very selective. I want to avoid 'fake news'. Oil price is higher than last year. There should not be a hint of a link between ignoring Saudi's guilt to Kashoggi's death and the oil price. But @realDonaldTrump is not able to sense that. Just bad, bad, bad.
1612 2018-11-21 22:16:28 @LouisFarrakhan  How is a terrorist organization to be known by their oil ?
1613 2018-11-21 22:16:25 I don't really like low-carb fare, but piss old fryer oil all over it?.
1614 2018-11-21 22:16:14 study the numbers, we get 40% of our oil comes from Canada and 11% from Saudi Arabia.
1615 2018-11-21 22:16:12 Your not responsibile for lower oil prices
1616 2018-11-21 22:16:05 So basically, Saudi Arabia said they would keep the price of oil low if @realDonaldTrump would say "Maybe he did. Maybe he didn't"
#POTUS45 sold the life of Khashoggi for a cheap barrel of oil.
1617 2018-11-21 22:15:54 It’s ok, get the Pillsbury or B Crocker one.  Any time it tells you to use water, use milk, use butter instead of oil, and throw in a package of instant pudding mix (use the corresponding flavor for your cake mix) & follow the instructions as printed. You’ll thank me later.
1618 2018-11-21 22:15:50 Key word: OIL!
1619 2018-11-21 22:15:48 He is. But they're so delicious. Especially if blanched then tossed in olive oil with those vacuum packed chestnuts and little cubes of pancetta. Yums.

Su correlación es prácticamente cero con precio del oil...cuanto más haya para distribuir...más barcos se necesitarán.
1623 2018-11-21 22:15:28 I wonder how much cheaper the oil price woudl get if we all allowed them to murder a few more journalists?
1624 2018-11-21 22:15:24 EYEBROWS
- If you have trouble getting full and dark brows, try putting oil on your eyebrows everynight before bed to promote hair growth, this also works for your eyelashes.

- Brush them and use browgel to put them in place
1625 2018-11-21 22:15:22 Like a water logged penguin covered in oil most probably but even that is a headline
1626 2018-11-21 22:15:11 Yeah and one of those “factors” is The Saudis control over oil, but I see you left that out?
1627 2018-11-21 22:15:09 I need to get a damn oil change but I don't want to today and I know tomorrow probably not gonna be an option fml
1628 2018-11-21 22:15:09 Dismantle the oil corporations.
1629 2018-11-21 22:15:00 Encana spun out its heavy oil production in 2009 when it created CVE and a lot of its AB oil interests in 2014 via Prairie Sky. They have invested massively in the BC Montney. Etc.
1630 2018-11-21 22:14:58 You blew it @Bill_Morneau ! Unbelievably bad! Higher deficits & no return to balance ever! No help for AB & the Oil & Gas industry! NO CHANGE in the regulatory regime that is stifling investment in Oil & Gas! No plans to withdraw C-69! And no offset for business carbon tax costs!
1631 2018-11-21 22:14:49 The Saudis didn't lower the oil price and Trump doesn't care. What Trump cares about is the money they promised him and his family.

The only thing Trump wants is to one day be a billionaire.

1633 2018-11-21 22:14:49 Remember these days Mr. President. You will be thank full for $350 oil price after 2020 elections. Arabs won't be able to help you either.
1634 2018-11-21 22:14:42 Well unless someone is planning on drinking the oil and stabilizing the Mid East out of altruism and humanitarianism (which I'm sure if going to start any day now) it seems pretty clear to me. Your trucks are only 'on the road' in pursuit of privilege and the almighty dollar.
1635 2018-11-21 22:14:35 Oil is a worldwide market. If SA stops pumping, oil speculators will raise the price until the supply meets the demand. On the other hand, if SA increases their pumping, oil speculators will reduce the price until the demand meets the supply.
1636 2018-11-21 22:14:26 After todays tweet from @realDonaldTrump its actually for cheaper oil he is siding with the Saudi's
1637 2018-11-21 22:14:25 Seriously Mr Trump. So it’s ok to murder and cut@someone into pieces for 9% of oil. For once@do@something be presidential
1638 2018-11-21 22:14:24 @realDonaldTrump ... thank you, Canada, for supplying your allied neighbors to the south the majority of our oil!
1639 2018-11-21 22:14:22 Canada supplies nearly 40% of U.S. oil.  Saudi Arabia 11%.  Also Canadians don't murder journalists, and Canadians didn't fly planes into buildings on 9/11.

1641 2018-11-21 22:14:17 This is the curse of Saudi Arabia using their oil billions to spread Wahabbism, the oppression-and-terror brand of Islam, all over the planet. And then Trump kisses their ass. But then, every US President has. I was hoping he'd be different.
1642 2018-11-21 22:14:13 Didn’t mention that Canada supplies more oil to U S than Saudies. At cheaper rates!Fake Fox News

1647 2018-11-21 22:13:35 No, our hands are not tied. We could put pressure on the Saudi government to bring the perpetrators to justice, including the crown prince. We could impose sanctions on the country if they do not. Right now, US gets 11% of its oil from SA. We could purchase it elsewhere.

1649 2018-11-21 22:13:26 You SHOULD be thanking Canada, not the murderous Saudi regime. Or didn’t you know that the US imports 40% of its oil from Canada, and only 9% from the Saudi’s? You’re protecting MBS not for oil imports, but for your own self interests.
1650 2018-11-21 22:13:26 trump is too stupid to know:
The oil/gas prices always go down in winter!!!
Supply and demand-ever heard of it?!?!
He is too stupid to know that we are smater than him!

1655 2018-11-21 22:13:12 I’d prefer a real tax cut.  Oil prices are bound to go up again.

1659 2018-11-21 22:13:01 Liberals need explain how the economy is helped by destroying the oil/gas sector which contributes upwards of 7% to GDP; how it will address declines in business investment since 2015; & how $600M to media, & lost federal revenues, benefits Canadians & ensures media independence.

1661 2018-11-21 22:12:54 Of, zoals @IEABirol onlangs zei bij de presentatie van de nieuwe WEO “people who think oil demand will diminish due to the rise in EV are not wrong...but very wrong!”
Vlg mij had hij daar wel een puntje
1662 2018-11-21 22:12:50 Trump is such a liar! He thanks Saudis for lowering oil prices when we produce the majority of our own oil. Our oil production has doubled over the last few years while demand has declined!  There's a crash in prices coming and I couldn't be happier.
1663 2018-11-21 22:12:48 Falling oil prices is terrible for my business.

Trump is a moron who knows nothing about economic issues.
1664 2018-11-21 22:12:48 30-50 oil tankers come in to Vancouver harbour every year already. Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr says the Trans Mountain pipeline will only increase tanker traffic off the coast of British Columbia by one ship a day

1666 2018-11-21 22:12:43 Coming up on today's show: we will take a look at the global oil market and how the #JamalKhashoggi scandal, Pres Trump's push for low energy prices and #OPEC's interests are affecting plummeting oil prices w/ Prof Bill Arnold @1OWL1
1667 2018-11-21 22:12:35 Today the .@POTUS THANKED the country, that very recently had a U.S. Resident and journalist murdered, for lower oil prices. NOT only is this NOT TRUE but it's reprehensible that he is so transparent in his bowing down to the Saudi's #Resist #Trump
1668 2018-11-21 22:12:35 That doesn't answer how planet helped shutting in Cdn oil when others will supply the demand. Same amount of oil used globally but u'd rather others get benefit, nice. Then on one side u say it's planetary and the other can't worry about Chi and Ind. Oh, ok, that makes sense
1669 2018-11-21 22:12:28 Olive oil has many uses in my house hold.

1671 2018-11-21 22:12:25 Funny part is.... Saudi oil only makes 11% of US spending.... Canada supplies over 40%
1672 2018-11-21 22:12:20 I believe Canada supplies considerably more oil to America than Saudi Arabia. Does that mean you would respect us if we started butchering people? Allies and the law are garbage to you aren't they, it's dictators and murderers that you respect isn't it? You're beneath contempt.

And no mention of our oil price crisis?! 

This is garbage!
1676 2018-11-21 22:12:10 Saudi Arabia is THE sponsor of terrorism, from 9-11 to ISIS. And they spend oil billions spreading their oppressive terrorist brand of Islam called Wahabbism all over the world, including in the US. Trump is excusing kissing Saudi ass by claiming Iran is terrorist to justify
1677 2018-11-21 22:12:10 Money and oil is no justification for genocide. Try to gain some ethics please.
1678 2018-11-21 22:12:06 Trump Backs Saudis, But This 'Double Cross' May Boost Oil Prices

U.S. stockpiles of oil rose, while President Trump pressure Saudi Arabia to keep prices down as OPEC's de facto leader weighs a production cut. Blood & Oil. Looks like going price for an American is $54 a barrel
1679 2018-11-21 22:12:06 My mom is seriously making me take my car get an oil change alone, who said I was willing to adult this break???

1689 2018-11-21 22:11:28 I imagine that oil is mostly from plants, not dinosaurs
1690 2018-11-21 22:11:27 Like any country, not every citizen is on the same page. al queda saw Saudi Prince as sleeping with enemies. The current rulers in SA are a hand picked tribe who were given keys to Mecca in exchange of oil, allegiance to British Empire. Jinnah was given Pak. Thank Churchill.

1694 2018-11-21 22:11:16 Well if SA was to stop producing Oil, then the supply in the short term would dry up and prices would reflect that but the slack would be taken by other producers and eventually, supply/ demand will find equilibrium. They do limit production to stop the prices dropping crashing.

1700 2018-11-21 22:11:02 Not to mention the fact that if we had an administration actively promoting green energy, China would not be eating our lunch with solar (which we pioneered), while we are acting as if the future of oil really matters.
1701 2018-11-21 22:11:02 Great because the American Consumer has been getting our pocket book raped for the past 12 years. I remember when oil was 50 dollars a barrel and we were paying 99 cents a gallon for gas.
1702 2018-11-21 22:11:00 Continuing my previous tweet - redirect our Alaska oil that we sell to Japan and China to the mainland! Simple solution!

Supply and demand-ever heard of it?!?!

1707 2018-11-21 22:10:52 Low oil prices hurt the US as well. They have been a contributor to a poor Alaskan economy
1708 2018-11-21 22:10:38 Saddam sold oil for euros. Gaddafi was going to back an African trading currency with gold. If the petro $ falls quick enough we may not be able to borrow enough to start a war.

1714 2018-11-21 22:09:58 SA has nothing to do with drop in oil prices. But if it keeps going lower it is going to hurt the US oil.
1715 2018-11-21 22:09:54 I don’t remember journalists being chopped to pieces by Saudis when oil prices were at $40 under @BarackObama
1716 2018-11-21 22:09:53 Keep murdering all journalists and the oil price will keep dropping lower. It is one way to lower that price. Go Saudi Arabia. Start decapitaing if you desire and Fake Prez will nod in approval.
1717 2018-11-21 22:09:46 Seems you don’t give a crap about citizens safety, just oil prices. #hypocrite
1718 2018-11-21 22:09:44 I made this little bottle for chapped lips  for myself to see how it worked.. It has been amazing!! I put the 2 oils with a little peppermint essential oil & it cleared my chapped lips. It’s #natural no chemicals #chemicalfree
1719 2018-11-21 22:09:35 If you actually think that a country that only supplies about 10% of our imported oil can effectively change your cost of gas at the pump... you are an idiot
1720 2018-11-21 22:09:34 You called the Iraq war right but you also said you thought the world economy would fold if oil reached $100

I think if there is a brexit the world will prefer British culture and law over Europe and we will more than hold our own

I hope we get to debate that outcome

 Perhaps someone should inform America's Idiot-In-Chief that America buys  more oil from Canada than it buys from any other country on Earth.
1723 2018-11-21 22:09:19 Except when it comes to Saudi Arabia, which sells us 11% of our oil(?!). Must be all the money they pipelined to you and Kushner. Doesn’t matter.  FIRST! Right?

1729 2018-11-21 22:09:04 perhaps now the Saudi's can just boil the folks in the cheap oil instead of the acid... no need for the bone saws!  Do you have to show what an ASS you are every minute of every day?
1730 2018-11-21 22:09:04 Because the Saudis alone control the price of oil on a world market with many players? Sure....sure...
1731 2018-11-21 22:09:01 And Dumbo started a trade war with Canada and Mexico, our 2 largest foreign oil suppliers. 
The problem is demand in the US is declining while our own oil  production doubled over the last few years.

1734 2018-11-21 22:08:49 Funny how you’re more scared of some of a few short guys with tortillas, than the “Axis of Evil”!?! The place where America’s sworn enemy...Islam adheres from!?!

Or is that causally ignored because of beautiful, clean oil!?!
1735 2018-11-21 22:08:44 No. #BoycottSaudiArabia is the right answer. I would rather pay $6.00 a gallon than support a bunch of murdering dicks in the Middle East.

We need to invest in renewable energy and end our addiction to foreign oil. 

We sure as hell don’t need to wallow in blood money.
1736 2018-11-21 22:08:35 pour oil on the Floors of all the condos they bought from trump and not let him no longer  do money laundering for them at a 10% cut?
1737 2018-11-21 22:08:32 Had a neighbour who was high up in the Oil industry, he could mow his lawn, on a Saturday, without stopping ten times to look at his phone. Inquiry Lawyers need ask for yearly total AKA #SunShineList
1738 2018-11-21 22:08:30 You literally said "it is time to focus on us." Meanwhile you want us to still have relations with Saudi Arabia because they supply us with a small fraction of our oil. Khashoggi was a person killed by the Saudi government. That matters more than a few dollars per tank.
1739 2018-11-21 22:08:27 No thank you Jamal Khashoggi, he gave his life..but this won't last. Oil prices will creep back up. It's a distraction by the Saudis and yourself. So one man's life is worth .10 a gallon less.....
1740 2018-11-21 22:08:25 The only person currently threatening Americans is you.
Apparently blood for oil is a real thing, and an American Resident with American Citizen Children can be murdered without consequences.
1741 2018-11-21 22:08:21 thank god Iceland made that palm oil advert because now that fiat 500 Twitter made every Spoons experience worsen by a factor of 10 they needed a new cause to sink their teeth into. 

- Tweet brought to you by the <3% of ocean plastic that comes from straws
1742 2018-11-21 22:08:20 No. You duped the Saudis. The Saudis (being stupid people) thought that Iranian oil was off the market, so they increased production. Then you granted blanket sanction exclusion to countrird importing Iranian oil. Result: over supply. Saudis are talking about cutting production.
1743 2018-11-21 22:08:18 No es ni educación vial, es tantita madre.
Por no perder un minutos los mexicanos nos matamos como cucarachas.
El peor enemigo de un mexicano es otro mexicano, aunque no esté en el gobierno (entrante o saliente).
1744 2018-11-21 22:08:16 And trying to bribe us with lower oil prices to condone MURDER will NOT WORK.
1745 2018-11-21 22:08:15 Why don't we stop buying oil from Saudi Arabia and buy a little more from real friends like Canada? Better yet use a whole lot more renewable energy!
1746 2018-11-21 22:08:10 To be clear, the USA didn't know about the concentration camps until they were liberated. Saddam Hussein was just an excuse to steal Iraqi oil. But trump does make bush look like a genius
1747 2018-11-21 22:08:08 Then we should kiss the Saudi’s asses for oil?
1748 2018-11-21 22:08:06 Just paid 10k for Wifey to be trained on the art of oil perfumery, 1 week. If she gets the 20k, it will be invested in getting the raw materials needed to start immediate production. After her first batch is sold, she should have 10-20k extra to also help someone else's business.
1749 2018-11-21 22:08:05 Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
1750 2018-11-21 22:08:04 Remove crude oil from the Nigerian equation and nobody will want to be a politician not to talk of becoming a president of this country. Political science may even be removed as a course of study in Nigerian universities.
1751 2018-11-21 22:08:03 I used the oil
1752 2018-11-21 22:07:59 SA's share in US oil imports is only 9%. Who's stupid?
1753 2018-11-21 22:07:57 Actually, it’s kind of nice to find a federal judge who believes something is beyond the power of the federal government to regulate.  As for female genital mutilation, put the guy away for a very long time — under state law and in a state prison.
1754 2018-11-21 22:07:56 There's going to be an oil glut in the coming years, there's too MUCH oil. Screw the Saudis, we don't need them at all! They are looking for legitimacy from the US. Trump happy to serve some up as long as he keeps lining his pockets.
1755 2018-11-21 22:07:54 Donald Trump sold America’s soul for a few barrel’s of oil #BloodForOil #JamalKashoggi #BeBest
1756 2018-11-21 22:07:47 Finns Win. #FinnsWin
1757 2018-11-21 22:07:43 When @BarackObama left office, oil was $53 a barrel.  He didn't boast.  He didn't tweet.  He didn't try - even sideways - to take credit for it as some sort of "tax cut."

You know what else he didn't do?  

He didn't thank a country that murders journalists.
1758 2018-11-21 22:07:37 Wouldn’t it get sore, it must cost a fortune in lube, or do they use whale oil there?
1759 2018-11-21 22:07:36 Autumn this year had a burst
The leaves that feel became sharpened
By the darkness
Off the oil fires
Lit in retreat
So nothing is bound
How beautiful the rage of burning sands
Shifting between each other
Twisting lands
Like my mind has become alien
I cannot hold anything #inkMine
1760 2018-11-21 22:07:36 That raises an interesting question:  Who else can we slaughter to reduce oil prices?
1761 2018-11-21 22:07:34 Me: Eh..I don't really care for Dragalia Lost anymore
Me: -Pulls Edward-
Me: I SUDDENLY STAN OIL SPILL I LOVE THIS GAME
1762 2018-11-21 22:07:34 This fraud trades a writers life for a 54.00 barrel of oil 
1763 2018-11-21 22:07:29 I’m talking about production costs and profit margins and those figures are indisputable you dragged in a Saudi welfare program.  Lower prices help the Saudis and everyone in the oil and gas industry knows it.
1764 2018-11-21 22:07:28 They were reliant upon oil exports. Venezuela had taken over & socialized the oil industry. In all fairness, it was working fine till oil prices dropped. But the gov was unprepared. The handouts werent organic economic growth. Currency changes, price/wage controls have failed.
1765 2018-11-21 22:07:22 
1766 2018-11-21 22:07:18 Right and NBC doesn't run ads for oil companies,  beer fast food etc.
Hypocrisy in full bloom
1767 2018-11-21 22:07:17 World economy needs Saudi oil
1768 2018-11-21 22:07:14 I once yelled WE GOT THE FINN, and you liked the tweet. Definitely positive.
1769 2018-11-21 22:07:14 @RyanHilMi You are so wrong.  Doing business with SA has more to do with American jobs and large lucrative contracts bringing millions into our coffers..than it does with oil.  We produce more. Let’s talk murders... Iran, China, and the Clintons...
1770 2018-11-21 22:07:12 I would rather pay more for oil than deal with Saudi Arabia. @realDonaldTrump , you have made a huge mistake
1771 2018-11-21 22:07:11 @fhollande You get no More Oil and Mohammad come and take Your Nickel nd Your Diesel is zu Teuer and Gülay Told you What To Do and you did wrong and God Do Aufheben you
1772 2018-11-21 22:07:10 You are thanking Saudi Arabia?  What about AMERICAN OIL COMPANIES?  SAUDI ARABIA IS LED BY A MURDERER.
1773 2018-11-21 22:07:01 Youre making an assumption. Also we get most of our oil from Canada so thats misleading
1774 2018-11-21 22:06:55 Ever the con man. Nothing to do with oil or jobs. He and Jared are being enriched and/or financially propped up by S.A.... and psychotic warmonger Bolton wants to use them in some incredibly necessary war against Iran.
1775 2018-11-21 22:06:46 Thanks Tony. I'm having a blast. Will do in hopefully a few days from now. The counters should be delivered this afternoon and I have to oil them up. They need about two to three days to sit before installing.
1776 2018-11-21 22:06:33 We also get about 7% of our oil from those commie lovin' Venezuelans. Huh, guess we don't think they're bad enough to not buy their oil, eh?
1777 2018-11-21 22:06:32 Not to.mention the Oil pipeline they want thru Syria so they get Saudi Oil to the European market faster. That's all what's this been about.
1778 2018-11-21 22:06:20 When you know well that you and I are like water and oil 
1779 2018-11-21 22:06:18 Fun fact from CBC news— Canada provides 40% to KSA 11% of the oil we import. Let’s get that factoid out to people.
1780 2018-11-21 22:06:12 Have you no shame?  If that journalist was your son, would you think the same way?  They murdered him on the orders of the Saudi prince and you tweet about oil prices.  You really have no business running this country!
1781 2018-11-21 22:06:08 Exactly! Only 10% of oil sold in the U.S. comes from Saudia Arabia! God help the halfwit known as @realDonaldTrump He should have been sent to a mental institution, not a boarding school so he could get the help he needed before he had a chance to embarrass America & Americans!
1782 2018-11-21 22:06:01 “There are 2 major varieties of oil on the market, and Trump used the near-peak price of one to make the near-bottom price of the other seem more dramatic The 2 are not the same, and the $28 price swing you are is praising hasn't happened.” Another con job.
1783 2018-11-21 22:05:56 Trump did not thank Canada.  He must not realize that Canada provides America with more oil than Saudi Arabia.  Of course Canada has not given as much money to Trump as Saudi Arabia.
1784 2018-11-21 22:05:48 Refine it here for the benefit of all Canadians.  No need for pipelines and oil trains.  Problem solved.  Simple.
1785 2018-11-21 22:05:39 Sorry to hear that! If you put a touch of oil on it, it should silence it right up!
1786 2018-11-21 22:05:34 I had the most disappointing donut of my life today. @TimHortonsUS had failed me. It tasted like sweet oil. It tasted like broken dreams, and mistakes.
1787 2018-11-21 22:05:31 What do you do with it? Oven roasted /Stuffed? Dangerous “Oil boiled”?
Stay safe. ;-)
1788 2018-11-21 22:05:19 Mum  u know i have pimples and i read it online that the oil from condom removes pimples thats why i am buying it
1789 2018-11-21 22:05:13 Eso puede llevar algo o mucha verdad. También puede ser que los críticos de AMLO sean mensos. O chaparros. Feos incluso. Pero todo eso se llama argumentación hacia la persona, y no es un argumento honesto.
1790 2018-11-21 22:05:10 But 40% of the oil comes from Canada and only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
1791 2018-11-21 22:05:07 Is she an oil lover or hater?
1792 2018-11-21 22:05:06 Donald  Trump has sold America’s soul for the price of a cheap barrel of oil. This offends me to the very core of my being. @realDonaldTrump @GOP
1793 2018-11-21 22:05:05 We do. Cape Breton has a trans-shipment facility that stores foreign oil to be shipped out later to US refineries.  It should be used to export Canadian oil.
1794 2018-11-21 22:05:05 If we are about to get free energy of the Tesla inventions, then why is Trump pushing oil&gas development & coal development?  Reconcile?
1795 2018-11-21 22:05:04 I can’t even say we’re not all like this ‘cos the wankers own that now FFS. I can’t say I’m not ‘cos that’s “virtue signalling”. They’re like oil, these fuckers, it doesn’t take a lot to coat everything with poison.
I’m happy for ya, love the show. Be well.
1796 2018-11-21 22:04:51 @realDonaldTrump has to be very careful trying to jawbone Oil and interest rates. I think he is making a a mistake here.
1797 2018-11-21 22:04:42 Body oil is almost done too.
1798 2018-11-21 22:04:38 Add oil
1799 2018-11-21 22:04:37 bro hot oil is scary shit be safe
1800 2018-11-21 22:04:36 #mining $GLD #energy #economy $ES $OIL CoryGroshek Our thoughts exactly!
1801 2018-11-21 22:04:33 Uhhh... oil prices are actually on the rise since October. Read much? Just kidding...lol.
1802 2018-11-21 22:04:33 My “Relax” essential oil so fye 
1803 2018-11-21 22:04:31 So is this their gift for letting them kill an American? You let them off and they lower oil? Shame on you! You are as guilty of American deaths as you claim Hillary is.
1804 2018-11-21 22:04:17 Tea tree oil can fix almost any problem you could ever have
1805 2018-11-21 22:04:17 I just don't think it actually has anything to do with "oil and arms.  Rather, it's about how many millions of $$$$$$$ Trump gets directly from The Kingdom for letting them do whatever...
1806 2018-11-21 22:04:12 How ‘bout clean energy, not oil
1807 2018-11-21 22:04:08 @AngelaMerkeICDU and Merkel is Vaillant hässchen and no Battery im duracell To Fuck again For Oil with Ottoman men and To Do shamekleben and God Lynch Merkel and Erbsündefrau Arab Do and Arab has Energy For This and Gülay Said and Mohammad Do
1808 2018-11-21 22:04:02 The US is now a larger exporter of oil than SA. You may not have misread the tweet, but your assessment of it seems flawed.

SA promising to spend $350 Trillion should not be in the consideration of how to handle a conflict or evil atrocities.
1809 2018-11-21 22:04:00 Put a drop of #Oregano essential oil in place of dried oregano in spaghetti sauce, pizza sauce, or on a roast. #Recipe
1810 2018-11-21 22:03:54 If Trump had let McConnell and Ryan do the work, he, Putin and Rex Tillerson would be on their way to tapping into Russia's trillion dollar oil contracts/reserves. Obamacare would be history, southern wall halfway built. Too much candy around. This will end terribly.
1811 2018-11-21 22:03:54 Mr. President "… let's go lower " , you meant oil prices or  your morals ?
1812 2018-11-21 22:03:36 As Oil falls, it seems prices at the pump drop only half as fast (and half as much) as they do when Oil prices rise.

This phenomenon contributes to a longer-term trend of higher & higher gas prices regardless of the cost of a barrel of Oil.

Worth investigating?
#MAGA
1813 2018-11-21 22:03:35 time to finish waxing and oil my skin before tight cotton pants and a loose shirt or perhaps I will go topless tonight
1814 2018-11-21 22:03:29 The bacon, beef, chicken etc gets cooked on the grill so it’s not in contact w fillet. But as for the oil it’s filtered everyday, one by one so flavours don’t get mixed up, but could differ w branches 
1815 2018-11-21 22:03:21 So he can make oil and oil production a key money maker the coming years. Build pipelines. 
How now can we say no to a pipeline trough holy ground now? The lobby around him is having the play-field of their lives and are out smarting us in global politics.
1816 2018-11-21 22:03:16 Is there a/any study of the number of birds dying from allisions with oil platforms/vessels due to night blindness caused by bright lights on said platforms?!? I suspect it will dwarf death by pollution from this and other spill incidents.  #Cdnpoli #NLpoli

1818 2018-11-21 22:03:13 Oil prices now lower. Great! Tax Cut for America and the World under Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Enjoy! $54, was just $82. Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let’s go lower in the first time in the U.S. and OPEC history!
1819 2018-11-21 22:03:09 my dad says “you need a car wash” and i’m like “yea i need an oil change, my headlight fixed and new wiper blades too but none of that is getting done” and my dad takes my keys and left to his autoshop right now i might cry
1820 2018-11-21 22:02:59 Ask the stupid fuck what he's getting Canadian oil for!!
1821 2018-11-21 22:02:58 People in charge don't care as lo g as they get their oil they don't give a fuck.
1822 2018-11-21 22:02:57 Oil & murder. SA’s legacy. Barbaric dismembering torture murder. The true Saudi Arabia.
1823 2018-11-21 22:02:57 It’s a hair conditioning and styling oil. I just finished the formula. Final test. I was going to do the descriptions and everything very soon.
1824 2018-11-21 22:02:56 @AngelaMerkeICDU And France get no Oil they get More bomb This time you Learn no
1825 2018-11-21 22:02:54 Wow. How cheap would oil be if we let Saudi Arabia saw up and dispose of Shaun Hannity. It might only be 50c a barrel but I think it would be worth it.
1826 2018-11-21 22:02:46 I think they do, actually, but they won't say they do, because they would rather (cynically) see industry succeed--including oil, gas, and timber. I'd like to see a healthy economy that takes into account the true costs of our actions, but our leaders right now are not into that.
1827 2018-11-21 22:02:37 2010 to 2014 spike in price per barrel was due to BP oil spill fiasco with Deepwater Horizon, which is about to be overtaken in overall degree of negative environmental impact by the 2004 Taylor Energy spill that still remains uncapped, and spilling, to this very day.
1828 2018-11-21 22:02:34 at $17 per barrel where a break-even price of $28 is required...yes, we are now paying customers to take our oil!

The Americans are making money hand-over-fist from this windfall while our largest energy companies in Alberta bleed $100 million a day in lost revenue.

...
1829 2018-11-21 22:02:23 I’ll get on oil change in Florida.
1830 2018-11-21 22:02:22 The only thing keeping oil prices from going down any further is people who drive places specifically so they can listen to podcasts
1831 2018-11-21 22:02:20 Ha!  The best. And really happy since last year we didn’t even have a proper season! This year is like that for olive oil tho...
1832 2018-11-21 22:02:19 @TulsiGabbard What about the potential impacts on the American people?  These should be part of the discussion.  Rising oil prices?  Bigger role in keeping Iran in check?  Not sure there's an appetite for either especially the latter if boots on the ground are required.

1834 2018-11-21 22:02:18 Doesn't make it any more right now than it did then.

You know as well as anyone else that no-one wanted/wants to anger KSA, because they control the oil

Probably why they want to derail renewable energy at all costs, but diff topic
1835 2018-11-21 22:02:14 By all means, lets forgive murder for lower oil prices.  LOCK HIM UP!
1836 2018-11-21 22:02:08 they borrow a lot of money from imf and world bank in our names and also add it to the proceeds of oil exportation and use it to buy estates abroad, make our lives are miserable, make sure we lack proper education, and keep us hungry all to keep up on a leash
1837 2018-11-21 22:02:07 Acosta's got no oil.
1838 2018-11-21 22:02:03 ohhh brotthher. since they day they discover oil in that desert u.s. presidents have been ignoring their human rights abuses as long as they keep the prices low. now that trump decided not to punish them for a crime that has not been proven you guys are up in arms...puhlease.
1839 2018-11-21 22:01:59 Yes it is.  imma just get a bottle of olive oil and pray over it. Can you gift holy oil?
1840 2018-11-21 22:01:58 Odd statement. Canada supplies 40% of our oil and the Saudis aren't the sole OPEC decision makers. 

You are a gross individual. We see what you're doing. You've sold us out on so many occasions but this is a new low.
1841 2018-11-21 22:01:48 I don’t know WHY I scheduled an oil change for this late on the day before Thanksgiving
1842 2018-11-21 22:01:48 Best economy in 40 years also we now get oil from U S also finally someone is try to solve immigration problem which every potus promised but never even tried. Know the facts just because people don't personally like him doesn't mean he is wrong for this country
1843 2018-11-21 22:01:47 You don’t know anything about the Saudis oil, it is the purist and  cleanest oil in world ..

1851 2018-11-21 22:01:32 Do you have a source connected to the statement that palm oil is the major "player" for the biofuels mentioned in this context? What about bagasse, biogas from U.S grown bioenergy crops?
1852 2018-11-21 22:01:30 I had to decide between getting my eyebrows done or an oil change for getting on the road.
1853 2018-11-21 22:01:26 Unconscionable overreach by Zinke and Interior in this and many areas around the country. Ripoff of America for private monied interests, many in oil, gas, coal sectors.

1857 2018-11-21 22:01:07 I don't know anything about it, really, so I'm going to assume you speak truth. I guess my thoughts were more along the line that Trump makes it sound like we can't live without SA and their oil and money and I just don't think that's the case.
1858 2018-11-21 22:01:05 I heard on MSNBC this morning that the U.S. is now the worlds leader in oil production. We really DON’T need the Saudis, whereas they DO need us.
1859 2018-11-21 22:01:02 I’m glad oil prices are so low, but so is the stock market. Where did the years gains go? Let’s work on getting them back up to finish strong.

1866 2018-11-21 22:00:35 空所を埋めよ。 There ( 1 ) ( 2 ) a number of layoffs in the oil company recently.
最近石油会社で大きな一時解雇があった。
 【答え】　(1. have ) (2. been )
1867 2018-11-21 22:00:35 I think so it’s oil free I used it a while ago and I loved it
1868 2018-11-21 22:00:27 It about money and Oil. He does not care about humaity or compassion.
1869 2018-11-21 22:00:25 November 21, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.

1871 2018-11-21 22:00:18 I wish you folks cared this much about Benghazi rather than a Muslim Brotherhood sympathizer.
If Trump pit sanctions on Saudi Arabia without proof, you’d be bitching about gas prices when they retaliated through oil prices.
1872 2018-11-21 22:00:15 Since we are also the world’s largest oil produce, we also have a say in the proc s, so for Trump to thank me he Saudis for low prices also makes me nauseous, in addition to his support of the killer MbS
1873 2018-11-21 22:00:10 Need a hot oil treatment and cut then ima get my hair done
1874 2018-11-21 22:00:08 And the next day Trump praised Saudis for lower cost of oil. WE DO NOT ACCEPT THIS BRIBE FOR MURDER.
1875 2018-11-21 21:59:59 Whoa, I like. Like an oil spill in the rain, or on a larger scale, The Strait of Hormuz
1876 2018-11-21 21:59:56 The 450L is nearly £10k, now that is madness, it makes about the same HP as the 250L, can’t see hondas logic with the pricing, also needs similar oil changes as a proper enduro bike, buy a 450x for a few grand less, far better off road as well
1877 2018-11-21 21:59:52 Mr President good day, lower oil prices? Will the consumers notice this? And it’s killing the offshore related industries, there’s two sides to every coin
1878 2018-11-21 21:59:47 Venezuela's horrid situation isn't cuz they're socialist ~ the causes are multifaceted (the coup, black market trading, drops in oil production & prices, more). 
1 in 6 kids here, in the wealthiest nation ever, don't get enough to eat. 
The world is not as simple as you think.
1879 2018-11-21 21:59:46 How do I know the CIA didn’t participate in the plan to have him killed and blame it on the prince?  You all have hated him since he took over and jailed his corrupt family. Sultans of oil, pedophilia, sharia law, oppression, and death.
1880 2018-11-21 21:59:46 Hey Donnie baby, it must be so comforting to your family that should your wife or one of your sons or daughters be murdered by the prince, you can still feel good about the oil prices and your hopes of getting richer with the Saudis. Hell, fly more planes into more towers. $$$$$$
1881 2018-11-21 21:59:38 Yeah he also said we were energy independent that we didn't need to rely on SA oil any more. Course he says a lot of nonsense.

1888 2018-11-21 21:59:11 Oil prices getting stuffing. Glue! Dislike a balls Tax People for America and the Hot Rocks. Crackhouse! $54, was unjust $82. Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let’s slime boobs!
1889 2018-11-21 21:59:02 Trump is getting something personal out of this deal. Once again, he's conning the American people. Our gas price decrease can only be attributed to Saudi Arabia if they give us oil for free.

According to @CBCAlerts, we get 40% of our oil from Canada and only 11% from SA.
1890 2018-11-21 21:59:00 I 100% support the use of CBD oil for dogs!
1891 2018-11-21 21:58:59 @hfxtraffic Exit on the highway leaving Dartmouth crossings heading towards the circumferential. One car on either side of the road, looks like gas or oil spilled on the road ??? Messy messy night
1892 2018-11-21 21:58:52 Yeah until Oil Prices go through the roof then you’ll be bitching about that being his fault too! Make up your f#@king minds!!!

1894 2018-11-21 21:58:50 So I finally got a garage, hit me up if you need your bmw fixed, I be doing oil changes, tune ups, replacing coolant pumps for the low, I’ll even install parts for you.
1895 2018-11-21 21:58:46 It's a mix of potatoes (sliced and slow cooked with olive oil) and egg (some people like onion in it including myself). You just poach the potatoes and my parents used to smash them, then they put the potatoes out and into the eggs. U put it back in the frying pan and voilà!
1896 2018-11-21 21:58:46 Trump's an idiot. Low oil prices are not because Saudi Arabia is so good to us. It's because OPEC pumped too much oil and now plans to cut back.

1899 2018-11-21 21:58:30 Trump just gave the green light to regimes everywhere: Do whatever you want, as long as you invest in our country and lower the price of oil. 
The UK can only count on the EU to stand by them..for now.
1900 2018-11-21 21:58:26 He is pleased trudope is PM. Canadian oil is under $20 a barrel
1901 2018-11-21 21:58:13 I presume you live in Russia not UK. My olive oil was 2.50 now 3.25. Massive traffic jams on M20 and A20 while new junction, new footbridges, new central reservations for Operation Brock go in. BrexitRecord for companies leaving..or just be a numptie.
1902 2018-11-21 21:58:09 We should all feel safer now. 

FOX News is discussing the importance of stopping robo calls.

Let's not worry about Saudi Arabia. They are great because oil prices are down. Priorities doncha know?
1903 2018-11-21 21:58:07 Sittin on the couch hittin this oil pen thinking about all my white friends racist parents and how im@so glad I'll never see them again
1904 2018-11-21 21:58:01 Yeah such a great win, so great the American oil companies will give many of their employees permanent vacations rather than take the hit to profits.
Such great winning ...

When are you going to become a real leader?
1905 2018-11-21 21:57:59 Pass the oil
1906 2018-11-21 21:57:56 Only 9? The collectors of the signatures are paid, and they'll confront and say anything to get you to sign. I'd guess the oil companies opposing the climate change initiatives in Washington State etc that lost during the mid-term vote paid solicitors who used these techniques
1907 2018-11-21 21:57:54 I finally got my damn oil changed can I stop seeing those “this is for the girl out there who needs to get her oil changed” tweets now
1908 2018-11-21 21:57:54 You are so sure of yourself on this but when one sides with a murder to save his own a$$ and under the false pretense of keeping oil prices down. Security is not what we have with you in office...far from it.
1909 2018-11-21 21:57:50 Breathe in the aroma of some lavender essential oil. I have several recipes for essential oil blends that help my daughter with panic attacks.
1910 2018-11-21 21:57:49 That’s strange. I read where the US only imports about 9% of our oil from Saudi Arabia. Doesn’t seem like they would have that much affect on the price, does it? Maybe there are other reasons you are defending them, hmmm?
1911 2018-11-21 21:57:48 One of many reasons why I hate winter is my scalp all of a sudden produces oil like there’s no tomorrow. I just washed/straightened my hair yesterday and I already need to wash it 
1912 2018-11-21 21:57:41 This oil change is taking too long. I’m so bored I posted on FB 
1913 2018-11-21 21:57:38 annnnd he screws domestic oil producers by driving their margins into the dirt.  /well played mr. deal maker.

1915 2018-11-21 21:57:32 Canadian oil is also cheaper....
1916 2018-11-21 21:57:32 Hey Donnie baby, it must be so comforting to your family that should your wife or one of your sons or daughters be murdered by the prince, you can still feel good about the oil prices and your hopes of getting richer with the Saudis. Hell, fly more planes into more towers. $$$$$$
1917 2018-11-21 21:57:31 Is it worth it?  The Saudis are not a great ally.  Three years ago they saturated the market with oil in an attempt to cripple the American oil industry. Quit being spoon fed your values.
1918 2018-11-21 21:57:31 Bottom line, when Saudi cut production no one can fill the gap, when any drop of oil production happen, only Saudi can fill that gap.
1919 2018-11-21 21:57:30 Saudi Arabia is the largest producer of oil in the world and there production levels set the worlds price.  If they cut back on production the price would go up.  I thought you went to Pitt.  They also help keep Iran in check.
1920 2018-11-21 21:57:30 Yeah but you know, according to Trump Canada is a national security threat to the US.  Most of us down here don't agree.  Thanks for holding up the moral high ground and supplying us our oil.
1921 2018-11-21 21:57:29 Dude. The oil is hot.
1922 2018-11-21 21:57:25 i just paid $30 for truffle oil...if my mac n cheese don’t hit this thanksgiving i’m fighting
1923 2018-11-21 21:57:24 I care about principle and international human rights. Imagine if Bush came out after finding out the Saudis assisted in 9/11 praising them, thanking them, and talking about how great the oil prices are now.
1924 2018-11-21 21:57:23 As percentage I suppose? Also oil and gas might not be that profitable in UK, off shore drilling etc.
1925 2018-11-21 21:57:22 Thanks, @sears but I don’t live anywhere near a location and my warranty covers oil and tire rotation for five years.
1926 2018-11-21 21:57:18 The Saudis keep the Muslim world on a lease is why we keep such a close relationship and buy their oil
1927 2018-11-21 21:57:17 .@USAmbCanada May I respectfully ask that you advise your ill-informed President that 40% of US oil imports originate in Canada-drilled for and shipped by American owned firms-with 11% coming from Saudi Arabia. He slaps tariffs on us due to a ‘national security risk’. KSA ok?Sad
1928 2018-11-21 21:57:14 OPEC, made up of 18 countries, sets oil prices, not Saudi Arabia that only supplies 11% of world's oil supply.
1929 2018-11-21 21:57:13 Oil price is higher!
Happy Mr. Trump?!
1930 2018-11-21 21:57:10 Yeah I just looked at pricing. No thank you! Lol castor oil works great at growing lashes so I’ll stick with that.
1931 2018-11-21 21:57:07 No, I mean made a bad situation worse. Aside from the sudden crash in the price of crude oil, the economy was already reeling from years of grand theft and mismanagement. Better than whom exactly?
1932 2018-11-21 21:57:02 Remember your friendly neighbour to the north? You get more oil from us....but we don't rate like your allies who kill people who don't share the same ideologies....the only fake news I read these days comes directly from your mouth. 
1933 2018-11-21 21:56:57 No on the lower oil prices! That hurts Texas Oilfield! @tedcruz Tell him!
1934 2018-11-21 21:56:53 EZ shares +1.2%, US shares +0.3% (but couldn't hold highs and driven by tech stocks so nothing to indicate here we have seen the bottom).
US 10 yr yld flat at 3.06%.
Oil +1.9%, gold +0.3%, iron ore +0.9%.
ASX futures +0.3%.
$A 0.7264 with $US index -0.1%.
1935 2018-11-21 21:56:43 Don't tell trump, but American oil companies hate low prices.
1936 2018-11-21 21:56:35 If you are going to deep-fry your turkey remember to
> completely thaw & dry,
> only fill oil to safe line so foam doesn't spill out,
> cook in open, well ventilated area (not porch or garage, no over the top)
> lower turkey slowly into pot of oil to avoid splashing.
Fire safety.
1937 2018-11-21 21:56:32 While true but the price is set by supply and demand and if SA increases production, prices will fall as supply increases and vice versa. So whether or not you import your oil from a leading Oil supplier is irrelevant to the price you pay for a barrel.
1938 2018-11-21 21:56:32 All he cares about is low oil prices for America and massive arms deals for military. Disgusting
1939 2018-11-21 21:56:26 ブクロは「俺達のリーダー！」みたいな ティーンエイジャーだからね
1940 2018-11-21 21:56:25 And I have a feeling its because theres just not much we can do that wouldnt affect the US adversely as well. Would you like to see us cut off diplomatic relations with the biggest oil producer in the world and a country that buys hundreds of billions in goods from us?
1941 2018-11-21 21:56:20 Yeah, and the thing about the oil prices. Fuck the petroleum companies. Until the government steps in and regulates these greedy bastards we will always be paying too much at the pumps. Has nobody noticed that when the ppb goes down the gas prices are dispraportionally. GREED!
1942 2018-11-21 21:56:18 I guess he doesn't realize that rock bottom oil prices, while eventually resulting in lower gas prices, reduces federal highway tax income AND kills the US oil sands market.
1943 2018-11-21 21:56:16 @shanedawson so the answer to your chapped lips "rants" on BOTH your platforms would be 
  • wet green tea bags applied to your lips
 • use lip exfoliaters 
    •almond oil and sugar for example
 • and drink water because the "GuRuS" do it
1944 2018-11-21 21:56:12 Has it translated to the gas prices? You’re an idiot. We don’t put unrefined oil into our gas tanks. And it doesn’t translate to lower gas prices overnight. So dumb.
1945 2018-11-21 21:56:12 Dude most of your oil comes from Canada. Jesus read a book or something.
1946 2018-11-21 21:55:58 And it's very wise to give thanks to a murderer for cheap oil, isn't it?
1947 2018-11-21 21:55:55 Erm Canada produces 40% of oil - Saudi just 9% 
1948 2018-11-21 21:55:52 Don’t you know that the US imports 40% of its oil from Canada, and only 11% from Saudi Arabia? #CBCAlerts So why are you thanking Saudi Arabia, a country that murders journalists and tortures women who engage in peaceful protests?
1949 2018-11-21 21:55:51 #SierraLeone Oil prices are going down in the world market. If subsidies were removed and now the price is based on demand and supply, we should be seeing a reduction in the pump prices of fuel.

1950 2018-11-21 21:55:40 it's good! I use coconut oil instead of butter and flaxseed gel instead of eggs. Everything else is basically the same.
1951 2018-11-21 21:55:25 For your chapped lips (on your Snapchat story) : take a toothbrush, dip in some coconut oil and brush your lips gently with it  :)
1952 2018-11-21 21:55:15 It'll be a tax increase next spring. The cure cure for low oil prices is always low oil prices. I can't wait until it's $5 bucks a gallon again, right about the time the economy is in full collapse. Need steady prices, and no manipulation. #2008oilprice #slowandsteady #noplan
1953 2018-11-21 21:55:12 Too bad he  thanked the wrong nation, 40% of our oil imports come from Canada.
1954 2018-11-21 21:55:05 Thanks. I will try to make it back to my home. I am currently several kilometers away from it. There have been several detonations in the town and it appears to be on fire. Apparently, there is a huge firestorm going on because of something. I guess a oil truck or gas lines.
1955 2018-11-21 21:55:03 How many murders will it take? BTW, you know zero about what is happening with oil prices. Imbecile.
1956 2018-11-21 21:55:01 Canada is America’s biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to  only 11% from Saudi Arabia. Yet you express bitterness to our Prime  Minister. As far as I know, Justin has never ordered the murder and  bodily dismemberment of a US resident.  @POzzur
1957 2018-11-21 21:54:59 So why not be nice to Canada? Since they provide 4x the oil that Saudi does.
1958 2018-11-21 21:54:43 Oil prices are lower around the globe causing more upheaval and unrest in the Middle East.  The economies in the Middle East are imploding.  People are revolting and eventually regimes will fall.  Trump, get all your money now from your friends, soon to be unfriended.
1959 2018-11-21 21:54:42 Need some cuticle oil STAT
1960 2018-11-21 21:54:41 We only get 11% of our oil from the Saudis.  We get 40% from Canada by comparison.  He’s a jackass, Bette.  We just need to not go over the cliff for the next two years.
1961 2018-11-21 21:54:34 For #WorldFisheriesDay I would not only like to condemn all oil consumption but most importantly offshore oil wells and unnecessary transportation of all goods which is a danger to ocean life and your livelihood.
1962 2018-11-21 21:54:34 ひぷまいのさ、くんなんですけど、くんのこと完全に「友情を越えているけれど恋情ではないなにか」で独占欲バリバリのバリに出てる……というか「自分以外のところにが行くはずがない」っていう勝手な確信による常識作ってるぽくてアカン
1963 2018-11-21 21:54:33 It will be very difficult to enjoy lower oil prices knowing that there is blood in the oil.
1964 2018-11-21 21:54:32 Everyone focuses on this exaggeration rather than the fact that @realDonaldTrump got prices down and cut Iranian exports in half. No oil expert expected this! Not one! Btw gasoline prices are down even more than oil in % terms.
1965 2018-11-21 21:54:31 It not Saudi’s... that Shell, Exxon, Mobile, BP there the ones driving the oil prices higher when it was 68 $ a barrel it was already at 3.99 a gal.
1966 2018-11-21 21:54:26 The oil dependency of world economy makes us all bitches. It is a pretty accurate formulation.
1967 2018-11-21 21:54:26 Amazing you can have a newer tractor and they will still leak oil.
1968 2018-11-21 21:54:23 My baby brother had football practice at Lucas Oil Stadium today
1969 2018-11-21 21:54:22 Yes thanks for valuing money and oil over lives.
1970 2018-11-21 21:54:18 Nice to see Hitch back behind a bench; albeit, life underneath the “big top” seems a little out of whack in oil town ~sigh #oilers
1971 2018-11-21 21:54:15 The same ones they would be calling "those greedy, polluting oil companies" if a Democrat POTUS increased taxes on them.
1972 2018-11-21 21:54:09 I don’t think you understand economics. This is Econ 101 when the supply increases the price of crude oil goes down. This will reflect on the refining cost which also lower the price at the pump IDIOT. You can only lie to your minority base but we the majority don’t buy it.
1973 2018-11-21 21:54:07 Canada supplies 40% of our oil. How do you not know that?
1974 2018-11-21 21:54:03 The oil is in
1975 2018-11-21 21:54:02 Green tea silk moisturizer. Use it at night. Feel like it gave me some great oil control benefits, but these acne scares...I need help with.
1976 2018-11-21 21:54:00 Oil price related?
1977 2018-11-21 21:53:56 When we get to the point where we no longer purchase oil from the middle east then we can be truly independent but until then we are stuck being tolerant which is the sad truth. You can not destroy the American economy just to prove a point so slap their hand and move on.
1978 2018-11-21 21:53:51 What’s that thing you check your oil with, a @lQuentin_Heard stick?
1979 2018-11-21 21:53:51 We dont even need to import oil.
Between fracking and natural gas we have all we need and can sell the excess, but that might cause the stockholders in oil to get angry because we are not getting enough for our investment.
1980 2018-11-21 21:53:46 C'est clair ! Hol(ly)idays n'en prend jamais...
1981 2018-11-21 21:53:45 They gave him cheap oil.
1982 2018-11-21 21:53:43 It utterly pains me to say it but I’m #boycottcadburys until I know where their palm oil comes from. No excuse not to use sustainable palm oil. No animal should die for a bar of chocolate
1983 2018-11-21 21:53:38 It's a bit of a conflict of interest for oil companies and governments that make so much cash.  The swap just need to be slow and consistent to make sure we can generate enough electricity from new powerplants. Hurry up fusion!
1984 2018-11-21 21:53:35 Go find your own oil you socialist fool. What about Iran? You and your left wing buddies made them rich.
1985 2018-11-21 21:53:28 NOT BRAGGING But I’m. A 2 Time cancer survivor had a medical Marijuana card for oil helped greatly but this in my personal opinion is going to be part of the DEATH of our nation Along with the socialist Democratic Regime &that’s why the legislators legalize
1986 2018-11-21 21:53:26 I went to get my oil changed in mt. p today and the guys that did it literally adored my car and like got excited when i revved her engine and shit  shes a 2003 hyundai with a v6 engine or smth and im happy they love her as much as i do
1987 2018-11-21 21:53:23 What a irony. Killing Alberta oil industry is working so fast,
as a side show it's going to kill Trudeau's government.
1988 2018-11-21 21:53:18 JLo is known to slim down with the grapefruit oil diet. Studies show smelling it can reduce one's appetite and help with portion control.
1989 2018-11-21 21:53:17 Donald Trump has just tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to 'a big Tax Cut for America and the World!' In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
1990 2018-11-21 21:53:13 Results of a democracy in a theocracy!trying to mix water with oil!
1991 2018-11-21 21:53:12 It's a Trump admin policy program:  Journalist Blood for Cheap Oil
1992 2018-11-21 21:53:06 You do realize that 40% of our oil imports come from Canada?
1993 2018-11-21 21:53:03 It’s a huge pot with tons of hot oil. There are always accidents. You have to do it properly & carefully. I wouldn’t dare.
1994 2018-11-21 21:52:55 A real leader would have us invested in renewable energy and exporting that technology rather than selling these monsters weapons. We need to destroy the oil market that feeds them.
1995 2018-11-21 21:52:47 We get the bulk of our oil from  Canada and SA isn't interested in anything other than spreading their own brand of the Muslim faith. What SA will do is pull the rug out from under Palestinians and more than likely Israel. SA likes Trump because he acts like them. SAD!
1996 2018-11-21 21:52:45 Its NOT about oil. 
Canada supplies 40% of American oil. 
Saudi Arabia 11%
He is lying. 
Spread this news!!
1997 2018-11-21 21:52:44 I have two lovely pals from Bulgaria and they’ve brought rose oil from home to me! It’s AMAZING!
1998 2018-11-21 21:52:35 Yum I’m running over.. even a bit of the oil will do me good if the bacons’ gone ... lol

2002 2018-11-21 21:52:18 Saudi oil funds terror
2003 2018-11-21 21:52:17 Oil prices have nothing to do with the Saudis. The USA is fossil fuel independent.
2004 2018-11-21 21:52:16 @BMatB olive oil. (Genuinely google free)
2005 2018-11-21 21:52:07 Gotta be. Black beans, pasta, parm cheese, egglant, pesto, all sautéed  in virgin olive oil. That’d be my entry.
2006 2018-11-21 21:51:58 trying to cut plastic waste down so i need some help and RT, i want some soap bars for my hair.  I thought i found a good one got REALLY EXCITED and then saw it had palm oil.   RT #plasticpollution #plasticfree
2007 2018-11-21 21:51:57 He was an employee of US company the Washington post. He was a resident of this country. He was not a terrorist and had only mildly criticized the crown prince and family.  Telling us to forget about it and enjoy lower oil prices isn’t gonna cut it.
2008 2018-11-21 21:51:55 Brand new Badia Garlic Minced in Oil (6x32 OZ) is now available at our store. Hurry up! Only  are left:  .
2009 2018-11-21 21:51:48 If America is the #1 oil producer in the world, I don't understand why we import any oil at all.

2013 2018-11-21 21:51:32 Is that cheap oil watered down with the blood of Jamal Khashoggi?
2014 2018-11-21 21:51:24 supplies you 40% of your oil ...11%
2015 2018-11-21 21:51:21 Chopping oil prices, chopping arms off .. Donnie doesn't know the difference.
2016 2018-11-21 21:51:18 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
2017 2018-11-21 21:51:16 Pity he didn't inspire you enough to halt arm sales to Saudi Arabia or refusing to recognise Palestine, or shutting down the oil pipelines which are destroying First Nation peoples and the environment. Tony Blair's Canadian cousin.
2018 2018-11-21 21:51:12 AND palm oil AND wood products. Beef is the major factor but it's not the only one. It's in the pic you tweeted.
2019 2018-11-21 21:51:10 Why will a country that uses a minority of their oil domestically partner with a country that is number 1 in exporting oil. Russia only has mouth in gas exports . please explain
2020 2018-11-21 21:51:08 Oil is a fungible commodity hotshot and Canada is *not* and has never been and never will be the world’s marginal producer.

That was and still is Saudi Arabia. 

#readbooks
2021 2018-11-21 21:51:03 This president, from his crass disgusting misogyny caught on audio tape, to leading his cult in horrific chants of"lock her up", to Helsinki & now selling American morality for crude oil & aircraft part orders....

This demented manchild in America's oval office is a MONSTER!!
2022 2018-11-21 21:51:01 All u Americans blabbing your mouths,go read some history about the Petrodollar and Nixon delinking the dollar from gold. Every US President since Nixon has kissed Saudi Arabia's ass, because without them the US economy will collapse. US basically swapped gold for oil to back d $
2023 2018-11-21 21:50:55 If Buhari promised 5k and letter could not pay on the grounds that there is no crude oil money,  no 100k you go pay?
2024 2018-11-21 21:50:53 If you are trying to be conscientious and not purchase single use plastic like bottles then how do you dispose of leftover oil? 
2025 2018-11-21 21:50:53 So what’s your plan?  Should we just say screw you opec along with 33% of our oil imports?
2026 2018-11-21 21:50:37 I’m just trying to get my oil changed and these little white kids are being real talkative, asking me hella questions
2027 2018-11-21 21:50:26 Didn’t you say lower oil prices were BAD for our producers
2028 2018-11-21 21:50:23 FACTS PLS: 
Saudi Arabia DOES NOT SET THE PRICE OF OIL; OPEC does. 
Only 11% of Saudi oil in USA.  
USA out produces Saudi Arabia & Russia now.
Saudi's wanted OPEC to reduce production to reduce oil on market and drive prices up.

2032 2018-11-21 21:50:13 i just gave my sister my oil pen lmao what am i doing
2033 2018-11-21 21:50:12 So Donnie, you do know the US imports 4 times the amount of oil from Canada as it does Saudi Arabia, right?
2034 2018-11-21 21:50:10 Liar! The Saudi’s have tried to INCREASE oil prices lately. (Before the murder).
2035 2018-11-21 21:50:01 If u refuse to stand up to your friends the Saudi's,maybe you could send your entire armed forces to the small North Sentinal island where the American God botherer was killed by natives for trying to force his belief upon them,surely there is a little bit of oil in those reefs!!
2036 2018-11-21 21:49:57 Did you know Saudi Arabia supplies 11% of Americas oil.
Canada..40%
You dont need Saudi Arabia. 
He is a liar.
2037 2018-11-21 21:49:50 It's great that Saudi Arabia cut oil prices. All it took was forgiving one silly 'ol murder!
2038 2018-11-21 21:49:48 Just a thought. Try the oil & gas industry.
2039 2018-11-21 21:49:46 Without Saudi Arabia oil you are nothing do anything for your country and peoples..
Because without oil all world is going to back in 1800...
2040 2018-11-21 21:49:38 You are a smart mzn..Most all of the Groupthink Media does not have thst kind of grasp on the movement of oil prices
2041 2018-11-21 21:49:37 I felt a little bad rostering Vick when he first came back into the league, but like now with low oil prices we play it loose with our morals when the fantasy points roll in.
2042 2018-11-21 21:49:37 You mean like the current oil prices going down being bad thing?
2043 2018-11-21 21:49:37 Trump & the Secretary of State are not only guilty of covering up the murder of an American resident.
They have also personally discredited the CIA and other American Security specialists for oil.
Trump & the Secretary are traitors.
2044 2018-11-21 21:49:36 And it’s a nasty polluter. We’re becoming less and less dependent on oil and gas. Times they are a changin!
2045 2018-11-21 21:49:34 Oh, it only took a murder to lower oil prices? Cool, cool....No need to make deals with the devil on account of me, I’ll pay more. #lurch #boxofrocks
2046 2018-11-21 21:49:33 Fanning the winds of War, with Countries that are our allies while defending murderous rogue Nations because they have Oil or will fund corrupt Campaigns. Shame.
2047 2018-11-21 21:49:29 Chopping oil prices, chopping arms off, eh?  What's the diff, eh Donnie?
2048 2018-11-21 21:49:29 Why don't you do something intelligent like put your efforts behind developing alternative and renewable fuels with your "arms sales" revenue, use our own production, and END YOUR INSANE RELIANCE on Saudi oil??  Oh wait, one element is faulty in my suggestion. :-/
2049 2018-11-21 21:49:20 The irony is. Cheap oil prices puts a lot of is own supporters outta work. But keeps the Middle East in power of oil.
2050 2018-11-21 21:49:18 Who the US buys their oil from doesnt change the influence SA has on global prices
2051 2018-11-21 21:49:11 Quit being so careless when changing the oil.  You’re welcome lol

Ci sono costruzioni in cemento armato, in carpenteria metallica, strade, fognature, palazzine per uffici, bunker per sale quadri e di controllo, ecc ecc, sono piccole città
2057 2018-11-21 21:48:57 Imagine what price we could get if they kill 1000 US journalists. $3 dollars a barrel. what a fucking bargain! I dont want this #BloodOil mr president, you can keep it. (Also please note that SA only provides 11% of the oil. Mexico and Canada provide more than 70% of US oil)
2058 2018-11-21 21:48:43 RT for Oil Ocean Zone! #LevelBot
2059 2018-11-21 21:48:43 @realDonaldTrump it sounds more like American arms producers and oil interests 1st, human rights and American ideals last if at all. Reasons like this is why we were kicked off the UN human rights committee. Oh yeah, I forgot we “quit”. You are an embarrassment!
2060 2018-11-21 21:48:41 More lies for the Fake president.  Trump continues to show how little he knows about most things.  Obviously he does not know Canada provides U.S. with more oil than Saudi Arabia.  I have not seem Trump thank Canada.  Trrump NOT GOOD!!

2065 2018-11-21 21:48:12 How many reporters will you let them get away with killing for low oil prices and arms sales?
2066 2018-11-21 21:48:10 How can oil prices be more important that the life of a journalist (or anyone)?  #Khashoggi
2067 2018-11-21 21:48:10 THANK YOU CANADA FOR THE LOWER OIL PRICES (we know you provide the  majority of oil).
2068 2018-11-21 21:48:02 Thanks! I noticed oil rinsing has worked for me (castor oil). I’ve bought some ingredients for a mask and I’ll look into some of your suggestions

2070 2018-11-21 21:47:42 I wish.  We pay per litre. We export 40% of our oil out to the US at roughly 17.00/ barrell and then buy it back refined at double or triple the cost.  And we pay $4/gallon at the pumps.  Cost me roughly 80.00 to fill a 66L tank.
2071 2018-11-21 21:47:41 Pass the olive oil
2072 2018-11-21 21:47:36 the recipe in that second photo I retweeted is honestly what I’ve done before. scrub and peel the beets, get them covered in olive oil, salt, pepper, wrap in foil, bake until tender
2073 2018-11-21 21:47:35 who is Americas biggest oil supplier?
Canada. Not Saudi Arabia.
2074 2018-11-21 21:47:33 Oil prices aren't "low" though 

They've gone from very, very high to moderately high

Still higher than when he was elected, at times almost 50% higher 

He's kind of admitting failure here

2079 2018-11-21 21:47:09 And eastern Canada keeps buying it from the foreign suppliers. Maybe a federal policy change should happen. And all imported foreign oil and gas should have a 20% tariff on it. #wakeupjustin #cdngov

2086 2018-11-21 21:46:56 OK. Castles in the clouds are tough to debate. I think that the entire world would go ape shit. The thought of all that oil/wealth/power being transferred to the US would be unacceptable. We are scheduled for  economic destruction,  you know? No saving us with a resource grab.
2087 2018-11-21 21:46:50 They murdered a journalist, you clown. I'll happily accept higher oil prices for a president with some ethical standards.
2088 2018-11-21 21:46:45 Prices would go much lower if we did not deal with Saudi Arabia! There is more than enough oil produced in North America than Saudi Arabia. This is why a POTUS should not have a conflict of interest due to personal businesses! Another example of being compromised!
2089 2018-11-21 21:46:38 $80 oil was back in 2014 !!
2090 2018-11-21 21:46:30 We import most of our oil....
2091 2018-11-21 21:46:29 Jobs can be created in other areas, like renewables, which already employ more than oil.
2092 2018-11-21 21:46:22 Thank you Canada. 
Canada sends 40% of US oil. 
Saudi Arabia...11%
America doesnt need Saudi Arabia.
2093 2018-11-21 21:46:20 understood!
2094 2018-11-21 21:46:19 Let's look at it from an economic angle. What is the impetus for believing in climate change, money? Hardly. However, the leading climate deniers stand to lose millions of dollars invested in coal and oil. They have an economic incentive not to believe.
2095 2018-11-21 21:46:14 Just as we are tired of trump, we, the rest of the world are tired of American boast of being our saviours. You entered the European wars late and reluctantly, attacked Iraq for its oil left Afghanistan high and dry etc etc . Maybe you do deserve him.
2096 2018-11-21 21:46:12 That's great news for your base that works in oil and gas... no, wait..

2099 2018-11-21 21:46:02 So trump is helping the Saudis keeping the USA from become oil independent. MAGA IS a lie. This is making Saudi great again.
2100 2018-11-21 21:45:54 You might as well not even cut it then. Just throw it in the oil with the skin
2101 2018-11-21 21:45:54 Great tax cuts the rich wait they the oil companies will raise it soon so they can make more money and blame OPEC

Oil will make playoffs and get blasted in the first or second round in typical Hitch fashion.
2107 2018-11-21 21:45:46 Oil prices are based in how much is produced worldwide. If Saudi Arabia (alone or with other OPEC nations)
cut production, oil prices will go up - whether we produce it ourselves or buy it from Canada.

But Trump is crazy if he thinks Saudi Arabia is trying to cut prices for us
2108 2018-11-21 21:45:45 Oil prices are LOW ? 

Hmm last I checked they were LOWER when this dude was elected and have been higher almost every day since 

Stop promoting his lies ....
2109 2018-11-21 21:45:42 @ClarkeJames15  Brother thanks for following! That shirt is crazy; are you a petroleum engineer? Have you heard of Nobel Oil or Zion Oil. Chat with you later.
2110 2018-11-21 21:45:37 Unfortunately no matter how low the oil price is, Australian oil companies never lower the 'real' price at the pump !! Ripped Off !!
2111 2018-11-21 21:45:29 Dude I don’t make oil 
2112 2018-11-21 21:45:29 What's the price to get a pass on journalist assassinations? A few bucks off oil? @Acosta should probably be worried.

What a disgusting thing to say to Jamal Khashoggi’s loved ones, that $ is more valuable than Jamal. @realDonaldTrump the US EIA can remind you Saudi Arabia only provides 9% of our imported oil. Btw Canada provides 40%. So why you thanking them? #nakedEmperor

2119 2018-11-21 21:45:02 Bin Laden was never found or killed. Bin Laden is a CIA agent. Every sane minds know now that 9/11 was an inside job.
The war on terror is a big joke.. Its the war on Oil. Not on Terror.
Trump knows that. Infact he said that in his GOP speeches. But now he is a hypocrite too
2120 2018-11-21 21:44:54 I was not going to be political this holiday season. Oil prices have nothing to do with the murder of a journalist. Trump is a traitor to our values
2121 2018-11-21 21:44:46 The Oil and Gas Industry isn’t so happy with you. Might want to not brag how you’ve managed to cut price of Oil with Saudi Arabian Bone Saw. Just saying. If falls much lower, lots of jobs lost.

2124 2018-11-21 21:44:36 Canada supplies 40% of your oil compared to 11% from saudi arabia.
This President is fooling half 5he country.

2126 2018-11-21 21:44:28 If I had enough peanut oil,I could get a turkey into outer space.
2127 2018-11-21 21:44:26 So how many people can the Saudis kill before oil becomes less important? 1? 100? 1000?
2128 2018-11-21 21:44:22 Fire Chiarelli. Hire @Woodguy55
2129 2018-11-21 21:44:11 Canada is the largest exporter of oil into the US. get your facts straight
2130 2018-11-21 21:44:09 One Barrel of Oil Equals 42 gallons, 159 liters or one U.S. Journalist.
2131 2018-11-21 21:44:06 Trump dead wrong again on economics: Saudi oil doesn't control U.S. prices.  Imported Canadian oil and oil products are 400% the size of Saudi imports. Kashoggi coverup to hide Trump's indebtedness to the Kingdom for saving him 2x from bankruptcy (they bought his yacht for cash)
2132 2018-11-21 21:43:57 The price is low bc there is a glut of oil! USA is producing a lot too causing the price to lower! This tRump is a swamp creature, the Putin puppet, violates all Americans by allowing and rewarding Saudi Arabia’s ruler with arms instead of punishing Khashoggi’s murderer!
2133 2018-11-21 21:43:53 as long as oil is cheap and @Trump does biz there they can keep killing dissents right!   #impeach #trump #potus
2134 2018-11-21 21:43:52 Did you even read the article? They are referring to lost royalties for the province not what the oil company is losing. The amount of people jumping to conclusions and spreading misinformation with regards to this story is ridiculous.
2135 2018-11-21 21:43:48 Still would like to see him run Lucas oil series
2136 2018-11-21 21:43:44 So transparent. You’re coordinating with Saudi to flood the oil markets and lower prices to cover murder

2139 2018-11-21 21:43:42 おつかれさま！！楽しかったー。いろいろ話せてよかった！あれやこれや色々手紙に書いてくね（笑）金曜に第一弾を持ってくー。
2140 2018-11-21 21:43:26 Correct me if I’m wrong but doesn’t the United States now produce more oil that Saudi Arabia?  If so, tell me why you are thanking Saudi Arabia?
2141 2018-11-21 21:43:21 WHAT TIME IS THE OIL GONNA BE HOT
2142 2018-11-21 21:43:19 Your manufacturing companies also charge fees for ATM, same with telcos, pharmaceuticals and oil companies. I see..
2143 2018-11-21 21:43:19 We often compare Bitcoin to gold. I believe that the obvious priority of stock exchanges and exchanges is to rationalize the volatility of Bitcoin, and this on a model that would bring more a comparison to oil or gas (brokerage technique and speculated value) ...
2144 2018-11-21 21:43:18 I didn't say Brent was at $54 and I pointed out I was addressing the use of Brent in the tweet (see "not exactly"). Axios suggests you should only use WTI for what US pays for oil, which is not true

2147 2018-11-21 21:43:17 Our commish loses all the league dues on oil futures every year. He insists its a solid investment. So my question is, how do you feel about oil futures? @stevedetora @WarrenJ508
2148 2018-11-21 21:43:15 can anyone explain to me why the entire city of flagstaff is getting their oil changed right now
2149 2018-11-21 21:43:13 The ppl need a full/detailed explanation of how Saudi Arabia has such power over the  that they can kill a  journalist & Trump wants ppl 2 thank them 4 the oil prices & their purchase of weapons that haven't happened yet? This is a whole new level of gaslghting & cultism.
2150 2018-11-21 21:43:07 But they are very happy to sell their oil to the West which has a lot of Christians and gays. Maybe we shouldn’t buy their oil and see how they cope.

2156 2018-11-21 21:42:54 “Lower oil prices and we’ll let that whole murdering the journalist thing slide.”
2157 2018-11-21 21:42:52 Pretty sure we produce most of our own crude oil, and therefore gasoline.
2158 2018-11-21 21:42:49 I like making pancakes with coconut oil instead of butter and almond flour in addition to regular flour...
So glad to get that off my chest
2159 2018-11-21 21:42:46 @BarackObama
So basically, 1. lots of raw greens or juice, 2. some fermented stuff like sauerkraut, 3. stuff I just described and 4. a healthy diet of carbs (you need them for energy and calories), oils like avocado or olive oil &proteins like kale, spinach. some meat if you wish
2160 2018-11-21 21:42:44 You didn't really just give a shout out to Saudi Arabia thanking them for lower oil prices, did you? #KashoggiMurder #MagnitskyAct #BloodForOil
2161 2018-11-21 21:42:38 You get like 40% of your oil from Canada, and we haven't killed ANY of your journalists or flown planes into ANY of your buildings. 
We did burn down the White House once, and there was that whole thing with not buying your milk... But hey, what have we done to you lately, right?
2162 2018-11-21 21:42:37 Cup need a oil change
2163 2018-11-21 21:42:30 No it’s slowly cooked in oil on a v low heat 
2164 2018-11-21 21:42:29 @MikePompeo says there will be "grave consequences" for those selling oil to Syria! Oh, like the "grave consequences" the Saudi's got when they murdered a US resident & journalist #Kashoggi? Yeah, REAL "grave!" @realDonaldTrump, the US is NOT w/the Saudi's; just YOU!
2165 2018-11-21 21:42:29 US exports around 8 million barrels per day, Saudi Arabia around 9 million bpd, Russia around 7 million bpd. That is just 3 countries. How is 8 million bpd, 70% of the worlds oil?

2167 2018-11-21 21:42:22 <10% of our oil comes from Saudi Arabia.  40% comes from Canada.  And the US is currently one of the world's largest oil exporters, which means plummeting oil prices are actually *bad* for America.  

But don't let the facts interrupt your victory lap, you goddamn dope!
2168 2018-11-21 21:42:19 They're oil rich, simple as that. Also lots of historical ties with the Saudi Bin Laden Family and some American big business. When all flights were grounded after 9/11 some members were given special permission to fly home on their private jet.
2169 2018-11-21 21:42:18 Do you love peppermint? There are so many wonderful properties and different ways this amazing oil can be used! #peppermint
2170 2018-11-21 21:42:13 I feel you. But, I think the nasty shit oil we get from Canada cant easily br refined to gasoline. Saudi has some sweet top shelf oil.

2174 2018-11-21 21:41:59 ive got no idea if the other arkham games hold up but god asylum is just covered in grime and oil and it sucks to look at
2175 2018-11-21 21:41:58 Moron, regardless of the percentage we import from Canada, Saudi Arabia is the biggest influence on the price of oil.  With its ability to increase or decrease its production, SA's influence on the price of oil is enormous.  Also, Khassoggi was a resident alien, not a US person.
2176 2018-11-21 21:41:50 Saudi Arabia has oppressed people for a long time. They do have some rebels many are worst the the present government. Not all rebels are good. After WWII we made a that they sell all their oil with US dollars . If this deal ends the dollar loses value
2177 2018-11-21 21:41:47 You weren’t about to come all the way from Columbus just to go with me to get an oil change.
2178 2018-11-21 21:41:43 not sure what "oil" or contract he is talking about. the front month contract for WTI only hit $76.90. Is he talking about Brent?
2179 2018-11-21 21:41:40 Yeah, those of us with oil and gas wells on our property thank the hell out of you, Donald.
2180 2018-11-21 21:41:28 Thanks. If you don't mind further questions, does demand for oil stay about the same when the price drops, or does the demand grow but it doesn't save the jobs?

What about natural gas: is it extracted & processed in separate facilities by separate employees, or is there overlap?
2181 2018-11-21 21:41:24 It's just as stupid as giving money to oil companies.
2182 2018-11-21 21:41:11 Saudi Arabia is a failing terrorist state.  In 10 years they run out of oil, and then what else do they have to offer the world except hate, bigotry, racism, and terror...wait, the GOP might have a place for them.
2183 2018-11-21 21:41:10 Coz I feel guilty lol I already ordered some stuff from Coach Outlet & more stuff from Sephora (cleansing oil + Foreo Luna II mini - coz both are on sale lol).
2184 2018-11-21 21:41:08 Not sell us oil.
2185 2018-11-21 21:41:07 regardless of its lack of power, it was tough. it could be over heated, beat, pounded on, run with no oil, and take a licking but kept running.

2201 2018-11-21 21:40:15 someone explain me how he "sided" with them. He said "maybe he knew, maybe he didnt". He sanctioned 17 people from SA. Im curios what u people want him to do? Cut off relations with the worlds leading oil producer? Do u realize what that would do to our economy?
2202 2018-11-21 21:40:08 全ての油という油に感謝しているよ。
2203 2018-11-21 21:40:06 thank you very much.
2204 2018-11-21 21:40:02 This is interesting, you blamed @POTUS44 for high oil prices, while his energy policy helped the U.S. to become less dependent on foreign oil.  Oh BTW, you have something on your chin.
2205 2018-11-21 21:39:59 I pointed it out because I believe trump would have reacted differently if he were a natural born American citizen, which is still wrong of him. All he cares about is money he’s not going to confront their government as long as they keep oil prices low.
2206 2018-11-21 21:39:54 I just saved a TON at the oil store!!
2207 2018-11-21 21:39:51 Let us know when Canada dictates global oil prices.

2215 2018-11-21 21:39:28 Because the Saudis are a key US and NATO military ally in a hostile region, and a major oil producing nation, and historically served a role as a reactionary bulwark against the USSR.
2216 2018-11-21 21:39:26 You have nothing to do with oil prices declining. The price is set by OPEC.

2223 2018-11-21 21:39:09 He knows the Saudis dont SET the price of oil, right?
2224 2018-11-21 21:39:09 Y’all bitches really trying to win the twerk contest why aren’t y putting oil on ya ass before the video ?
2225 2018-11-21 21:39:07 Ok, "Take their oil".
Would that be easy, or hard? How would Russia, China, Europe and the UN react to that? We could beat the Saudis in 3 days, maybe 4. What would happen then? How would our own Left react? Would the world "band together" to drive out the invaders? Complicated.
2226 2018-11-21 21:39:06 Again, it's real shitty, and shouldn't be countenanced. But it's important to understand the actual reasons why. Yes, the oil IS part of it, but nowhere near as much as so-called "national interests" are.
2227 2018-11-21 21:39:06 Yeah my stepdad works in the oil field and prices are up they were really low and companies were laying people of in boat loads and now prices are way higher than they were something nobody really talks about is how unstable it is to work in that field

They are already Rich, can sell their oil anywhere in the world and US Citizens don’t like to walk to work. What is the benefit again?
2242 2018-11-21 21:37:48 It is a fact. Malaysia did not have any palm oil trees. They planted those on large numbers after attaining independence. IK also has a vision for forestation in the country. But it should be with an economic purpose besides environment benefits.

It's important for them (in imperialist eyes) to maintain a strong ally in the Middle East as a ward against Russian influence & to (mostly) keep the rest of the volatiles in line.
2251 2018-11-21 21:37:07 Canada is the biggest exporter of oil  the USA.

Goodluck only ruled Nigeria in a time of oil boom, we wil never know hw he would fare in a recession
2258 2018-11-21 21:36:39 I hate excessive amount of oil in my food IT MAKES ME PUKE
2259 2018-11-21 21:36:38 I wonder if they have oil
2260 2018-11-21 21:36:21 Yeah, thanks Canada. Pretty sure they import more oil and kill fewer Americans. #DumpTrump #MadAsHell
2261 2018-11-21 21:36:10 Oil prices are down because the market is down because of your stupid-ass tarrifs. Did the Saudi’s cause a drop in the housing market too? Enjoy the failing of your economic policy and your presidency. Enjoy, I am.
2262 2018-11-21 21:36:08 Ughhh just the thought of the amount of oil those donuts were made in uGHH
2263 2018-11-21 21:36:06 や、でもこのきもちわかるなあ
2264 2018-11-21 21:36:05 Easy for him to say when he can buy our oil at $13 and make billions for American companies.
2265 2018-11-21 21:35:51 Playing techno at the oil change place cause a bitch bored af
2266 2018-11-21 21:35:49 Or maybe he told his staff to take plane to Saudi Arabia and tell them that all is okay with that journalist as long as they start flooding the world with oil to cheapen the price? No better moment then shorting oil since that visit.
2267 2018-11-21 21:35:45 Looks like this campaign worked- now onto ALL the other manufacturing companies who use Palm Oil.
2268 2018-11-21 21:35:42 Merci beaucoup Canada  for 40% of America’s imported oil. GFY Saudi Arabia and your 11%. #Resist #LiarInChief #NotMyPresident #IdiotInChief #canada #grateful
2269 2018-11-21 21:35:38 What inflationary pressures are there?  I only see deflationary: cheap oil, global slowdown, cooling housing market
2270 2018-11-21 21:35:38 おはよういってきます
2271 2018-11-21 21:35:31 I thought I heard that SA was going to cut production to raise oil prices.
2272 2018-11-21 21:35:31 Lower Oil Prices cause the lost of thousands of jobs because we cannot afford to drill our own reserves. I guess you want us depended on Middle East Oil again like we were in the 70's. I remember the Oil Embargo! Do you? That's right you probably had a LIMO!
2273 2018-11-21 21:35:30 I just bought a cool new iPad  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
2274 2018-11-21 21:35:27 Where did you read that tidbit? I’d like to be enlightened. Also, did you see his tweet about crude oil prices? What are the odds that dropping fuel prices  are a  reward for cooperation? They’ve waited long enough to be coincidental. Thoughts???
2275 2018-11-21 21:35:25 I don't think it's arms sales.  I think it's $$$ for the #TrumpCrimeFamily that is informing his actions.  He just wants everyone to think it's arms sales ... Or oil prices ... Or joba ... Or his "great" relationship with the Crown Prince.
2276 2018-11-21 21:35:24 Hasn't it always been "blood oil" but now it's only important because it's a way to blame Trump's administration?  Or are you just as Angry over the murders in Benghazi on HRC watch?  Americans matter too.
2277 2018-11-21 21:35:19 Of course you need them to go lower. Your Iran sanctions put low oil prices at risk. Oh and you owe Saudi’s for bankruptcy bail out. You are a amateur criminal taking advantage of people’s fears. How your mob buys into your BS I will never understand. Complicit #khashoggi
2278 2018-11-21 21:35:18 You do realize that low oil prices hurts American oil producers also.... right. You going to take credit for when they suspend exploration and cut back because their costs are higher then Saudi's
2279 2018-11-21 21:35:14 Hahah jokes on you I brought some food and truffle oil from NYC. I EMBRACE CHAOS
2280 2018-11-21 21:35:13 We get 40% of our oil from Canada.
2281 2018-11-21 21:35:13 Extremely low oil prices will stop domestic production - bankrupting American oil producers and costing jobs in Texas, Oklahoma, North Dakota etc
2282 2018-11-21 21:35:12 Thank you to the jerk that stole my @amazon package...I hope you enjoy your cat flea treatment, cat pheromone calming oil and replacement k cup filter. Thankfully, #AmazonCustomerService was a rockstar and replaced the items and gave me a refund on the one they couldn’t.
2283 2018-11-21 21:35:11 Donald Trump has just tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current  low oil prices, which he likens to 'a big Tax Cut for America and the  World!' In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at  40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia. (CBC)
2284 2018-11-21 21:35:11 Yeah. From field storage to unload position. I have the detent on our tractor set at 15 secs, works every time, except if oil is very cold
2285 2018-11-21 21:35:04 1st Donald screwed the farmers. Now the Oil and Gas Industry must not be too happy either. And How many Coal Jobs came back? @WhiteHouse has screwed the very people that voted for it.
2286 2018-11-21 21:35:03 A foreign botsky troll. I guess the oil Saudi algorithm alerts them.
2287 2018-11-21 21:34:53 "In case I wasn't clear enough from my previous tweets:

@FrankLuntz knows oil prices better than anyone in the United States."

- President Hillary Clinton
2288 2018-11-21 21:34:53 Enjoy?? Thank you Saudi Arabia?? Wow! You’re not even trying to hide it anymore...it’s blood for oil! 
2289 2018-11-21 21:34:46 Well if Putin controls the oil price, then Donnie should be able to kiss his a$$ to get the price even lower.
2290 2018-11-21 21:34:42 @realDonaldTrump You are absolutely ridiculous. You have put oil, of which the US supplies plenty on its own, ahead of a human life. You have no morals.
2291 2018-11-21 21:34:41 Mel gets some stuff out of the fridge and fumbles around in cupboards for things to use.

"I'm only doing this once.", she grumbles as she bends to grab some coconut oil.
2292 2018-11-21 21:34:37 11% of US oil comes from Saudi Arabia. 

You are defending murderers not for that 11%, but for you family’s business interests.
2293 2018-11-21 21:34:37 Rajouter à cela la coalition des producteurs de charbons de la NA, Exxon, Imperial Oil. Source "The denial machine", Fifht Estate, CBC, mars 2006. Le reportage n'est plus disponible, mais je l'ai dans mes archives personnelles. Trop lourd pour le partager.
2294 2018-11-21 21:34:36 I don't appreciate blood in my oil.
2295 2018-11-21 21:34:35 DO NOT fill above maximum fill line.  I would go a little under.  You can always add more oil later.
2296 2018-11-21 21:34:28 We have Gold, Oil, Diamond, Cocoa, Bauxite, and all natural resources but everybody is BROKE except politicians and pastors.
2297 2018-11-21 21:34:24 Where’s your evidence for Canada supplying  more oil than Saudi Arabia.
2298 2018-11-21 21:34:20 Have you noticed grocery prices? Trump rhetoric is about keeping oil prices down but any savings at the pump is gone (and then some) at the grocery.
Trump has blood in his hands across the board.
2299 2018-11-21 21:34:20 When the US oil companies start complaining that the oil prices are to low and start cutting jobs, are you gonna give them a bailout, or are you just going to give them less regulations and more tax breaks
2300 2018-11-21 21:34:17 The division between fields of study is fake. Me doing a BSW/MSW/MPP/MPH to pursue a career in environmental justice instead of drilling for oil is not unrelated to my earth and environmental science degree. I did not "waste my time" Thank you !!!
2301 2018-11-21 21:34:09 If all Iran oil is sold  ; isn't 20 $ too high for a black market

  1  cup of  Basil 

 Marinate  Veal in 1/4 cup Olive Oil and  Basil for 1 hour. 
 Roast  Sweet Potato in oven at 400F until cooked. 
 Finish in the oven and serve. 

 Don't burn it!
2304 2018-11-21 21:33:58 The Dow closed fractionally lower on Wednesday after being up more than 200 points earlier in the day. U.S. oil prices rose more than two percent, bouncing off 13-month lows. BU-49WE
2305 2018-11-21 21:33:58 And the dumb ass is only hurting the US oil and gas business
2306 2018-11-21 21:33:57 Just watched the video on the oil change. It ain’t even that hard lol. Even on foreign cars 
2307 2018-11-21 21:33:53 The meeting occurred after sharp reductions in crude oil prices that saw declines in Brent crude oil prices drop from a peak of $86 per barrel on October 3 to $70.18 per barrel on Nov. 9, just ahead of the meeting. THESE FACTORY SHOULD BE BUYING UP THIS STOCK.
2308 2018-11-21 21:33:48 In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
2309 2018-11-21 21:33:37 Favorite oil?
2310 2018-11-21 21:33:36 Canadian oil is $13
2311 2018-11-21 21:33:34 Perhaps if more Russian officials began wearing the keffiyeh the West might be more willing to accept them as equal global partners.
#Khashoggi #DoubleStandards #Hypocrisy 
Clearly oil, billion dollar arms purchasers #Trump West's precious claims of being "global moral guardians"
2312 2018-11-21 21:33:31 One gallon of used motor oil can ruin approximately one million gallons of fresh water!
2313 2018-11-21 21:33:31 Lower oil prices are determined by the market and that has been determined by the new vast quantities of oil on the market thanks to American oil production not Saudi Arabia
2314 2018-11-21 21:33:29 My future husband & I will at least one year have a thanksgiving where everything we cook is made with THC oil, & whoever passes out first from eating too much and being too stoned loses.
2315 2018-11-21 21:33:22 Dudes who revolve their whole personality around having a beard are the weakest race and need a hobby that isn't buying overpriced beard oil on the internet
2316 2018-11-21 21:33:17 Obama would have ended up at the same conclusion, but done it much more eloquently and with more style. 
He sold giving a planeload of cash on pallets to a terroristic regime with a well reasoned, diplomatic and measured oratory.
2317 2018-11-21 21:33:16 Sitting in the auto shop waiting room for my pre-Thanksgiving drive oil change and I feel I have become one with the scent of Little Trees.
2318 2018-11-21 21:33:14 Screw Saudi Arabia - we get more oil from Canada, numb-nuts. The cost for oil from them is too high, a cost that is UN-AMERICAN.
2319 2018-11-21 21:33:12 Oh. Tee hee. The tarte maracuja oil is really good for hair and skin
2320 2018-11-21 21:33:06 1. Lay down newspaper or something under and around fryer.  It will splatter. 2. Do your best to dry the turkey.  3. Take your time adding turkey to oil. 4. Use meat thermometer.  5. Enjoy!
2321 2018-11-21 21:33:04 Why? They don't have any oil.
2322 2018-11-21 21:33:04 Absolutely. My issue is not dems vs cons. My issue is that the past administrations(obama/bush/clinton) have all pandered to SA oil and arms sales while looking past atrocities much worse than 1 dead journo
2323 2018-11-21 21:33:04 kanada, emptied of its minerals and dirty oil. emptied of its trees and water. a crippled thing, drowning in a puddle, covered in ants. the ocean doesn’t give a shit because it knows it’s dying too.
2324 2018-11-21 21:33:03 Please don’t bring your family of 5 to jiffy lube to wait for your oil change because now I have a headache and people are sitting on the floor and kids screaming okay thanks.

2326 2018-11-21 21:32:52 In case you didn't know, WE are the largest oil producers in thee World!
2327 2018-11-21 21:32:50 Oil! Unless it’s a super thick shea or something!
2328 2018-11-21 21:32:49  ‘trusted with Robert Snell’ next you’ll be suggesting she makes chilli for Nee’oil!  (poor Jane, we are teasing you so much)
2329 2018-11-21 21:32:48 Because I don't care about the characters sexuality when I watch a TV show because such things aren't relevant to the overall story
2330 2018-11-21 21:32:42 I think the real problems in the region right now are bad economic conditions, unemployment, falling oil and real estate prices, expats leaving gulf countries etc.
2331 2018-11-21 21:32:38 But, we get our oil from Canada and by fracking here. Thank you Mr Trudeau? Or do oil prices just go up and go down. 
No need for me to thank the guy with the bone saw though,  is there?
2332 2018-11-21 21:32:36 I didn't expect my co-worker to casually drop the n-word today but there's a lot of covert racists in oil and gas. Most of them are intensely conservative so it's not that shocking.
2333 2018-11-21 21:32:35 It’s all about the oil, yea right.....isn’t video a wonderful thing
2334 2018-11-21 21:32:33 Yes, but the US supports the Yemen war and could pull other shit as well to make a statement, Trump just refuses and that is the real issue. He just focused on oil because that is all he knows about Saudi Arabia outside of the fact of all the real estate he has which is the real
2335 2018-11-21 21:32:30 I would also add that it is a misconception that it was Kazatomproms decision to IPO. The privatization of over 800 companies is part of a reform to modernize the Kazakh economy which was hit hard by the oil price. $KAP is just a pawn in a larger strategic gov plan. #uranium
2336 2018-11-21 21:32:29 Why do bbc not challenge envIronmental protesters & artists complaining about oil companies, but who never challenge over population which is the cause of #climatechange? #costingtheearth #radio4 #r4today #newsbeat #bbc3
2337 2018-11-21 21:32:24 #CNN Guess U Forget the saying: "the ENEMY of my ENEMY is my friend"  FDR didn't Forget !!-RE: Saudi Arabia  is our  "Friend " in Middle East vs IRAN--who Promotes  & Pays for TERRORISM   & They  Also NOT Enemy of ISRAEL--&  helping to "Keep" Oil PRICES Down & not WARRING vs USA
2338 2018-11-21 21:32:23 Saudi Arabia isn't an ally. They're an ally to the political class. Hence why I put Trump supporters in quotations. I can see why Trump did it, because rising oil prices would be disastrous for Trump's presidency. At least use the Journo death as leverage on all their info on9/11
2339 2018-11-21 21:32:16 If its about trading and investing I'd go for two. How I made 2 million in the stock market by Nicolas Darvas and Reminisences of a Stock Operator by Edwin Leferve. A little old but the basic principles still apply today.
2340 2018-11-21 21:32:03 The new houses ain’t so bad but older ones gotta have wood, i use a bit of oil late spring/early fall but would freeze in winter if not for wood
2341 2018-11-21 21:32:01 Meanwhile, all oil being stolen from Golan Heights and North Syria stopped immediately and US forces and their proxies withdrawn. All they are are thieves
2342 2018-11-21 21:32:00 When did Saudi Arabia become the only country we buy oil from? Trump is the first POTUS to not put ANY conditions on countries that buy arms from U.S. We have been a beacon of human rights - that's what makes America great. DT/GOP are destroying our greatness.
2343 2018-11-21 21:31:59 Dear President Trump, with all the agencies under your authority, tell us whether the crown prince was directly involved in the assasination. Yes or no? Second, the most important product for the US economy is the values of human rights and not the oil. 
@realDonaldTrump
2344 2018-11-21 21:31:48 Up from a nap that I had hope would have taken this headache away.. that’s alright.. BC powder and peppermint oil to the temples should help.
2345 2018-11-21 21:31:48 If you consider that we could replace all oil for cars with water and half the plastic items with hemp, it could make us so much more independent, we wouldn't need to deal with Saudi or anyone else. Hemp is very versatile, you may want to read up.
2346 2018-11-21 21:31:42 Gggg gotta finish this oil painting >> i hate the creative limitation of this class but we can talk about that another time (aka ill make a video)
2347 2018-11-21 21:31:40 Just got half off my oil change and I’m not even cute today. These guys were jokin’, jivin’, and keeping me entertained. I told them I had a coupon for $7 off and they gave me half off. And then the elder gentlemen came and put air in my tires. Blessings!

And they were all FINE!
2348 2018-11-21 21:31:30 Bloke needs to pull his head in, he’s no oil painting either.
2349 2018-11-21 21:31:30 The new slogan "Blood and Oil".
2350 2018-11-21 21:31:29 The temperatures are dropping. Heating oil is expensive. People need fuel for their fires! Or maybe it’s extra paper to line their cat litter boxes!
2351 2018-11-21 21:31:26 Rising Oil Prices?
2352 2018-11-21 21:31:12 Both countries have nationalized oil. However, when Venezuela nationalize the oil they pissed off a lot of US companies. Norway didn’t have that problem. Most commerce in Venezuela is in the private sector. Same as Norway.
2353 2018-11-21 21:31:12 Yes. There recommendations will be simple. Stop Producing oil to raise the price. That way JT gets what he wants, Notley keeps some sense of morality and the Alberta people get screwed again but can be told it was the recommended decision.
2354 2018-11-21 21:31:11 So, how long before US oil companies complain that oil prices are to low and  start cutting jobs.
2355 2018-11-21 21:31:02 Hid the truth about oil
2356 2018-11-21 21:31:02 "this is ISIS, 
this is ISIS on billions of dollars of oil money,
any questions?"
2357 2018-11-21 21:31:02 some bitch walked into the dealership for an oil change and walked out with a new mini van
Im weeeeak!
2358 2018-11-21 21:30:53 Cars are literally so much maintenance I cannot. I need an oil change, my tires rotated, NEW tires and to renew my plates.. like...  Who authorized this?
2359 2018-11-21 21:30:43 Logical sequence that does take place, yet lower oil statistically leads to lower inflation => that side of the equation wins.
2360 2018-11-21 21:30:43 Thanks @JustinTrudeau and Canada for the oil, kick rocks and burn in hell MBS
2361 2018-11-21 21:30:36 Why would you apply so much of oil?
2362 2018-11-21 21:30:35 The only truly Vers Top left in 2018 is extra virgin olive oil
2363 2018-11-21 21:30:30 Harry looks like he's on his jollies in Benidorm. I'm expecting him to ask where Tiki Bar is while slapping on some Hawaian Tropic carrot oil soon. #ImACeleb

2368 2018-11-21 21:30:11 I definitely plan on buying CBD oil soon to help with my anxiety. I’ve heard it helps a lot of people and I’m really interested in trying it.
2369 2018-11-21 21:30:08 @TellEmSteveDave all shit is untouchable, because of disease. The only exception is cow stool. This is antiseptic, and even (at a push, ) edible. It is collected by children ,dried and burned as fuel. Americans don't know this because they are backwards and murder for oil instead
2370 2018-11-21 21:30:08 I do like the big beefy vet line that can wear down opponents. They’ll just have to be careful not to take too many penalties.
2371 2018-11-21 21:30:01 Thanks Saudi Arabia for brutally murdering a U.S. resident & hacking his body up in pieces?! Most of our oil comes from CANADA!! We know how much $$ you get from the Saudi’s. You said it while campaigning. It’s playing on TV B4 the one where you lie about it.
2372 2018-11-21 21:30:00 That was an oil company asking people how we fix climate change. Next up: "how do we stop kids eating so much chocolate?" hosted by Willy Wonka.
2373 2018-11-21 21:29:58 President Obama’s last full month in office, oil was at $46.72. Thank You @ObamaHitsBack . 
2374 2018-11-21 21:29:43 The “stronger” economy gave them some wiggle room so they throw that money away for a competitive incentive that’s going to lead to some shortfalls on budgeting next year. All while the oil industry is in the tank. This tower is going to crumble
2375 2018-11-21 21:29:41 why haven’t i been shaving w/ baby oil??? shout out to facebook!
2376 2018-11-21 21:29:34 The kicker is, he does not like our prime minister because in good old Canadian fashion,  we told trump to fuck off....so now he has to suck up to someone else. So, logically he went to the next leveraged oil producer.
2377 2018-11-21 21:29:33 So I took my car to go get an oil change on my lunch break when I came back and picked it up they had cleaned out my car and left me a flower inside. I started crying in their parking lot 
2378 2018-11-21 21:29:30 Its not about importing it, the dependancy comes from the market prices that the Saudi can drive up cos they have the easy oil to extract and a lot of it.
2379 2018-11-21 21:29:25 Don't forget kuZora cooking oil waku announcer... unless you're sweating from calculating 10+4, 
2380 2018-11-21 21:29:15 On @npratc, @RichardHaass says that it's almost as if the administration is treating foreign relations as a business. When was it otherwise? Trump has made it explicit. What was W. Bush doing when US forces rushed to secure Iraqi oil (& Haass was Dir. of Policy Planning)
2381 2018-11-21 21:29:15 Again CBC gets the facts wrong, USA buys 27% of its imported oil from Canada, 
And the Middle East does control the world oil pricing.
Another example of liberal run CBC twisting the facts!
2382 2018-11-21 21:29:11 well they should! nevertheless,  burning firewoood isn't perfect - but greater alternative than importing furnace oil/burning diesel for baseboards.
2383 2018-11-21 21:29:11 I also have a love for the smell of 2 stroke oil!
2384 2018-11-21 21:29:02 How's heating oil and diesel prices in the Northeast Pres?
2385 2018-11-21 21:28:52 The true price of oil is our souls. Renewable energy looking cheaper every day!
2386 2018-11-21 21:28:38 @realDonaldTrump  Have a Happy Thanksgiving . Just like we want more cheap oil, we need more immigration to help with the employment. The Fed will use rate hikes to stop the growing economy.  We cannot find any employees. Help legal immigration @FoxNews @BuzzFeed @CNN
2387 2018-11-21 21:28:35 Probley " FAKE NEWS " ADVICE TO AMERICANS , KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE GAS PUMPS & THE COST OF HOME HEATING OIL. GOVERMMENT WILL PROFIT MORE FROM PAYING LESS & RAISING THE PRICES TO US CONSUMERS. THATS AMERICAS WAY LIKE ITS ALWAYS BEEN, CITIZENS ARE THE ONES WHO GET SCREWED !!! RIGHT?
2388 2018-11-21 21:28:35 It's a tax cut for the USA and a major revenue cut for Russia. Lower oil prices are bad for Russia and good for the USA. Russia funds its military through its oil and gas exports. Trump has been far tougher on Russia than Obama and Bush. Impeach that Dims.
2389 2018-11-21 21:28:31 This isn't burning the midnight oil. This is burning the whole GODDAMN HOUSE HEHE
2390 2018-11-21 21:28:29 Not the victims of " white people "  or more specifically a white male.
No gain in attacking one of your own protected identity groups.
2391 2018-11-21 21:28:29 There was a regime change in Saudi Arabia. Not once did the mainstream media question Saudi Arabia's involvement in 9/11 now they want me to be upset because some Bin Laden groupie who wrote an oped for the WaPo was killed? Oil $ is tanking. That's their punishment. Thanks Trump.
2392 2018-11-21 21:28:22 1 Put turkey in microwave

3 Load kids, spouse, pets into car
4 Set microwave for one hour
5 Drive to hotel
6 60 minutes later, call fire department and see if turkey is done

2394 2018-11-21 21:28:19 О, блин, жиза про ФТ (после первых сообщений долго думала, Тэйлы это или Твари). Мне кажется, в фэндоме давным-давно забыли, каковы характеры персонажей на самом деле.
2395 2018-11-21 21:28:19 Haha, it was more watery & less of that palm oil  but in a really good way!
2396 2018-11-21 21:28:17 @BP_plc @Shell the price of Brent crude oil has fallen by 20% since the 20th October, how long until this fall in Oil prices is reflected at the pumps? @TheAA_UK @TheRAC_UK
2397 2018-11-21 21:28:13 So let me get this straight. For you to get lower oil prices you’re ok with an American citizen being killed, chopped into pieces and you not doing anything about it?! You are a disgusting human being.
2398 2018-11-21 21:28:11 @scottishlabour - keeping Scotland poor when it was the richest country in europe was a strategic decision to keep folk voting labour in London elections. They kept folk poor in the middle of an oil boom for votes. Never forget that and never forgive them. Utter cnts.
2399 2018-11-21 21:27:59 Is a monkey you advisor. Or could be the fake making this news. There will not oil for your nation in about 20 years ahead.  Dealing with murderes is the death of Democracy!
2400 2018-11-21 21:27:59 So, what’s all the talk about how much oil the USA produces?  Why should turmoil anywhere have a big effect on us?
2401 2018-11-21 21:27:52 Trump is the most despicable person in America, and 4th in the world behind Putin, Kim Jung Un, and Saudi Prince.  I’m sure hearing he’s not number one in the world irks him. Trying to sweep the Saudi Prince horrendous murder under the carpet with falling oil prices is deplorable
2402 2018-11-21 21:27:50 ...market demand as it will be more desirable than super high API US shale oil for refineries’ feed. The technology is available in pilot scale, but needs capital for commercialization. I think Province should choose to make an investment on this instead of full blown refineries
2403 2018-11-21 21:27:48 Are you open minded to try CBD Oil?
2404 2018-11-21 21:27:47 Umm....not drop oil prices?
2405 2018-11-21 21:27:46 Climate Change Slows Oil Company Plan To Drill In The Arctic #climatechange
2406 2018-11-21 21:27:44 The US has been sitting on some of the largest reserves and buying other countries oil. The US should and could determine the market. Flood it for a year, gasoline should be $.50/gallon and then the Middle East would beg us to buy some, they don't grow wheat.
2407 2018-11-21 21:27:42 Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
2408 2018-11-21 21:27:42 Yeah, lower - pretty soon the bottom drops out of the US oil producer profit margins. Fracking has a minimum price per barrel below which it no longer makes sense. And there go American jobs, here comes more imported oil and that balance of payments with which you are obsessed.
2409 2018-11-21 21:27:40 Maybe but only if you were sitting on most of the world's oil supply
2410 2018-11-21 21:27:40 lol what a joke. huge deficit to try and boost manufacturing? you already killed it with high hydro costs. those jobs are already gone. why don't you help the struggling oil and gas (Alberta, sask) or mining (BC, Ont, Que) industries which still have a chance of surviving?
2411 2018-11-21 21:27:38 Bill, we are losing billions every year that we can't get our oil to tidewater. We need pipelines built, get it together!
2412 2018-11-21 21:27:34 Jesus have mercy. A human life brutally destroyed weighed against oil prices. He goes lower still.
2413 2018-11-21 21:27:32 Brandon acts like coconut oil is the cure for everything lmaoooo

Me: My phone dying 

Brandon: try coconut oil .... the trader joes kind
2414 2018-11-21 21:27:32 Hot oil treatment...tonight
2415 2018-11-21 21:27:31 And when oil flees Alberta because of C-69 wh at are we left with?
2416 2018-11-21 21:27:23 That’s pretty amazing. It was only a few weeks ago that I heard the Saudis were going to be pushing for other oil producing nations to agree to cut back production, to raise prices for oil. So, a nice deal come of that only involves one murder.
2417 2018-11-21 21:27:15 it was an oil rollerball and now it’s thin sheen all over my face and arms
2418 2018-11-21 21:27:15 The problem is whether or not Big Oil cares... and I don’t think they do. A very large part of their environmental action is merely PR. As Thoreau quipped “Simplify, simplify, simplify!” the mantra of #ResourceCapitalism is “Extract, extract, extract!”
2419 2018-11-21 21:27:11 You ass- we  get less than 9% of our oil from Saudi Arabia. You are bragging about trading the dead body of an American journalist for your own personal wealth- the Saudi Prince’s brother owns lots of property at Trump Tower. Invoke the 25th.
2420 2018-11-21 21:27:08 Hes wrong about the US needing to import oil from SA ( only 11% is from SA) so the US dosent need Sa oil. However hes correct about the need for oil
 americans would starve if all oil disapperd (like every orher nation at this)
2421 2018-11-21 21:27:06 Good to know. This recipe involved hazelnuts, cranberries, red onions, olive oil, balsamic vinegar & maple syrup. Had to cut the 4 lbs of sprouts in 1/2 as well as the hazelnuts. Time consuming
2422 2018-11-21 21:27:05 DISINFORMATION. Oil glut causing low gas prices. Economics 101 supply and demand. But @FoxNews has not so well educated viewership. #ThanksgivingEve
2423 2018-11-21 21:27:04 (4) #ICESCR #ConcludingObservations on #Argentina: The use of #fracking at Vaca Muerta oil and gas reservoir should be “reconsidered” (parag. 14).
2424 2018-11-21 21:27:03 How many gallons of oil is a journalist life worth
2425 2018-11-21 21:26:59 We only get 11% of our oil from Saudi Arabia while getting 40% from Canada.  Oh and they also killed one of our journalists. The prince ordered it.  Would it be possible for you to side with the good guys just once? Not the murderer, not the fire, etc?
2426 2018-11-21 21:26:53 So, basically Trump is saying "Saudi Arabia killed this dude, but hey, we're getting a deal on oil right now, so nbd?"
2427 2018-11-21 21:26:49 welllll knowing that straight vinegar and oil won’t mix, technically if the vinaigrette was legit, they could do vinegar only 
2428 2018-11-21 21:26:47 You’re a hack snake oil saleswomen.  PhD in “psychological fields” lololol
2429 2018-11-21 21:26:45 Weapons and oil.
2430 2018-11-21 21:26:44 I didn't know this until today. This is absolutely crazy. Anyone that thinks this isn't motivated by Trump's personal financial gain, need just know this fact. We get more oil from Canada!!! I need a drink...
2431 2018-11-21 21:26:42 He’s justifying his standing by the murderers of a US resident by giving false facts about oil contribution. Catch up.
2432 2018-11-21 21:26:40 I got the lactic acid and the Hyaluronic from The Ordinary Skincare. I got the Rose Hip oil from whole foods. (Sometimes I use the thayers witchhazel from wholefoods as well) and sometimes i use the pigmentation serum from murad (good 4 if u have scarring or hyper pigmentation)
2433 2018-11-21 21:26:37 I know I wouldn't trade blood for oil.
2434 2018-11-21 21:26:34 Discount oil is not worth a dead journalist.
2435 2018-11-21 21:26:25 We are paying more for fuel in Australia now then when oil was $150.00 a barrel. 
2436 2018-11-21 21:26:24 So you want to economically crush hard working American families by taking the risk that there is a recession due to oil price hikes like during the Jimmy Carter era?? Or you want another actor president that says stuff that makes you feel good but does nothing? You’re lost
2437 2018-11-21 21:26:21 @POTUS @VP @WhiteHouse They must feel good knowing you would gladly sacrifice any of them to keep the oil flowing from Saudi Arabia.  How many barrels does it take to ignore one dismemberment?  Is there a published price list on your website?
2438 2018-11-21 21:26:19 Hey dummy, we get most of our oil from Canada!!!
2439 2018-11-21 21:26:19 Hahaha..let us talk about crude oil..and I am pretty sure you know there have been couple of inventions that could have replaced it..
2440 2018-11-21 21:26:13 Don't ask us to study. You need a crash course on the branches of government, constitution and human decency. I am NOT grateful that u r our President this Thanksgiving. Start working with our allies Canada who supplies the US with oil
2441 2018-11-21 21:26:12 Imagine sharing bed with a person who applies coconut oil every night before sleeping lol
2442 2018-11-21 21:26:10 Lack of logic in Quebec after USA Oil train kills 47 & there’s no outrage then they block a safe pipeline which would earn them billions but buy foreign oil. Why bother with a Pipeline when they can get billions free welfare $ from Alberta via Ottawa in Equalization money. Sick
2443 2018-11-21 21:26:08 Why do you tweet? It only confirms your ignorance of EVERYTHING. Economics, oil prices, the Constitution, the Justice Department, Congress. GO AWAY!
2444 2018-11-21 21:26:05 @ItsIyke_ coconut oil has made this thing itch so much, I actually wanna scream 
2445 2018-11-21 21:26:00 You must be feeling better now I hope

Do you look at women now or is it not the strong oil?
2446 2018-11-21 21:25:59 With Europe To Unite Under 10 Rulers,One Taking Overall Charge,With America As Its Ally You Have The Beasts Of Rev-13.With Great Power From Satan They Could Take Control Of The Worlds Oil Which All Modern Nations Are Still Depended On Thus Making The Nations Depending On Them.
2447 2018-11-21 21:25:58 USA imports 11% of oil from SA so it is hardly dependent. The largest imports are Mexico and Canada, but by far the largest part of american used oil is actuall made domestically, like in North Dakota.
2448 2018-11-21 21:25:50 Trump is publicly backing Saudis because of oil and jobs neither of which he has ZERO proof.  Trump is financially conflicted with the Saudis we know it.
2449 2018-11-21 21:25:47 #محمد_بن_سلمان_حبيب_الشعب
this tweet to people of America that we must be fully careful , Saudi arabia can destroy our economy and whole world if they get angry so let us be a friend with them and not an enemy.
The fair price of oil for Saudi around 70 $US
2450 2018-11-21 21:25:39 But there are other places we can get oil. Canada, for example.
2451 2018-11-21 21:25:31 I would prefer higher oil prices and less murder. #tradeoff #SaudiCrimes
2452 2018-11-21 21:25:30 those piece-y bouncy curls... they probably don't smell like coconut oil but my Hank wig does so....
2453 2018-11-21 21:25:29 Secured lower oil and hence lower petrol prices
2454 2018-11-21 21:25:28 From comparing profit levels of oil, gas and water in the UK
2455 2018-11-21 21:25:25 Frigate is not going anywhere neither the Trident UK sub,those west have been compromised by oil dollar and become subjugstive to Arabs whim jst as US
2456 2018-11-21 21:25:24 Thought budgets balanced themselves...hmmm what will the excuse be as can hear it now....TRUMP and lower commodity prices like say oil/natgas....mark my words we need 4 more years...trust me
2457 2018-11-21 21:25:17 I’m already paying $3.79 for regular. I’d take higher oil prices any day if it means US leadership, integrity and respect from abroad. Ain’t none of that happening while Trump is in charge, regardless of what his red state bubblers think.
2458 2018-11-21 21:25:17 You do know that we only get 5% of our oil from Saudi Arabia? The price is based on supply and demand, but I guess this is another of your "alternative" facts. Shame it is at the cost of our moral standing in the world!
2459 2018-11-21 21:25:16 ND fields can't run when oil cheap like now. Seems like I remember break-even is $35. Economy is going to have a turn down. Oil high or low,either way it hurts.
2460 2018-11-21 21:25:15 C koi Benzema, une marque de gas oil ?
2461 2018-11-21 21:25:11 We only get 11% of oil from SA 40% from Canada.., u should do ur homework !
2462 2018-11-21 21:25:08 Why don’t we stop burning bridges with Canada since we get a lot more oil from them than Saudi Arabia...and, I don’t think it’s liberal to realize there isn’t going to be an endless supply....someone has to consider environ. before it’s gone.  No hope for old farts in office now!
2463 2018-11-21 21:25:07 You, Your oil prices, Your tax  cut scam,and Saudi Arabia can go to HELL!
2464 2018-11-21 21:25:07 My hands and feet get hella dry at times no matter how much lotion or oil I put on them  it’s a flaw I can’t stand 
2465 2018-11-21 21:24:52 Keep dreaming. The Saudis have too much power over the US (i.e. OIL (Americans will then raise hell if the Saudis raise the prices on us)). Ever thought of that? U will believe ANYTHING that makes Trump look bad 
2466 2018-11-21 21:24:52 I need the oil prices to stop dropping ASAP pls
2467 2018-11-21 21:24:46 What is the meaning of “We export 70k of the worlds oil”?
2468 2018-11-21 21:24:42 OK, now I know u r an idealogue. Pls explain how shutting in Canadian oil allows planet to survive (I assume u r talking about AGW, yes?) when prod'n will be replaced by a country with less Enviro regs than Canada? I am trying interested in the answer
2469 2018-11-21 21:24:42 Weed isn’t honestly the best thing in the world. All I need money and weed (or just cannabis oil)
2470 2018-11-21 21:24:30 >@GermanyDiplo Riyadh would advised spending money into countries buying Saudi oil in proportion decent.
2471 2018-11-21 21:24:30 Correct. 40% comes from Canada. Saudi Arabia has become a lower wrung player as far as oil is concerned
2472 2018-11-21 21:24:28 try and meditate love and use some
lavender oil
2473 2018-11-21 21:24:27 @SenateGOP @SenateDems getting a discount on oil prices shouldn’t mean we turn our faces to a person being killed. it’s embarrassing to see this happen and the senate on both sides say nothing.
2474 2018-11-21 21:24:25 Low oil prices helps Americans. Sorry if that pisses investors off. Thanks @realDonaldTrump
2475 2018-11-21 21:24:21 Didn’t know Exxon controlled all the oil in the world 
2476 2018-11-21 21:24:20 Really need to get back to painting with oil colors 
2477 2018-11-21 21:24:19 The scary part is the fact that he doesn't see anything wrong with his correlation between cheap oil/cheap lives.
2478 2018-11-21 21:24:14 @realDonaldTrump There you go again lying . We get very little oil from the Saudi . Only your base believes you . You have put money before life.  You are not just a terrible president you are also a terrible man.
2479 2018-11-21 21:24:09 What has that got to do with Canada on a larger scale? Saudi Arabia is keeping oil prices down for everyone not for the US only because it controls the oil market as a whole.
2480 2018-11-21 21:24:09 But oil prices tho..
2481 2018-11-21 21:24:09 Why do the Dimwitocrats continue to comment on issues they "THINK" they know about, Oil prices, Whitacker, Mueller, ALL THINGS TRUMP. Dimwitocrats are brainwashed with propoganda by MSM, Deep State, all PAID by criminals seeking to destroy America with Socialism. WAKE UP FOOLS!
2482 2018-11-21 21:24:00 That cheaper oil comes at an exorbitant price.
2483 2018-11-21 21:23:59 I don't think Trump understands that lower oil prices will kill the profitability of US oil companies and put further strains on the stock market.
2484 2018-11-21 21:23:55 Help Venezuela intead. They are in an economic crisis, because they can't sell their oil, their biggest export.
2485 2018-11-21 21:23:53 Last year and years before, I was sickly too. That’s unfortunate about your partner. Thankfully I’ve been taking CBD oil from hemp this year and been a lot better. I’m sensitive to injected foreign toxins with potential serious negative effects so it’s best I avoid the flu shot.
2486 2018-11-21 21:23:48 Nigeria's macro fundamentals have since stabilized since the initial shocks that were triggered by low oil prices and production from external and internal disruptions to support real investments as against those of  volatile opportunism
2487 2018-11-21 21:23:38 Snake oil salesmen have always been persuasive.
2488 2018-11-21 21:23:37 Because American oil producers love losing money numbnuts

2490 2018-11-21 21:23:29 I just posted list of corp laying off & only spent a few minutes. I didn't looking at housing or oil yet. Layoffs going on & msm not saying a word. 2018 gains on stock market wiped out. Some financial sites saying recession. The economy is turning bad.
2491 2018-11-21 21:23:29 We get most of our oil from Canada and domestic sources.
2492 2018-11-21 21:23:29 ahh so the Saudis figga if they drop oil prices by saying they now all sudden have  OVERPRODUCTION nstead of weeksnaho when they said THEY WUD SLOW PRODUCTION AS TO CRIPPLE WORLD ECONOMY IF THEY WERE SANCTIONED OVER KHASHOGGI DEATH
2493 2018-11-21 21:23:28 Hahahaha...you think money and oil is a blessing. Lmao. Gd gives those who have no share in the world to come their blessings here..cause thats all you get. When your times up..you have no shamayim. Your soul is wiped out.
2494 2018-11-21 21:23:28 OPEC maintain control over oil prices, such as the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991; the resulting economic tumult disrupted Russia's production for several years. The Asian economic crisishad the opposite effect: It reduced demand. In both instances, OPEC controls.

2499 2018-11-21 21:23:05 Is there something I missed. @realDonaldTrump doesn't acknowledge the torturous killing of an American, thanks the Saudi's who are behind the killing for supplying 11% of oil to US and doesn't thank Canada, who provides 40% of our oil.....what the fuck is wrong here?
2500 2018-11-21 21:23:04 Wonder how this tweet will go with the oil and gas base here in the States...
2501 2018-11-21 21:23:04 The last time oil prices were at $82, was back in 2014. The closest it’s gotten to $82 was earlier this year and it hit $76.41 and that was under your watch so really you have no clue what you’re talking about. Looks like you’re pulling numbers out of your ass again!!!
2502 2018-11-21 21:22:58 America produces more oil than Saudi. Who loses, stable genius?
2503 2018-11-21 21:22:51 Everytime I come get an oil change it’s sum new then these niggas always wanna just give me $70 off nigga i new like $170 tf....You jits CHEAP 
2504 2018-11-21 21:22:43 I need it to buy oil for shiloh....like 10/15 cartoons and sell.
2505 2018-11-21 21:22:42 We have become a leading EXPORTER of oil. Before you tweet, get your facts straight. In other news, a human being was dismembered, with a bone saw, while still conscious.  Trump is too cowardly to call out the Crown Prince.  Not because he thinks the act was heinous, he wants $.
2506 2018-11-21 21:22:40 80's prices were what??  & gas was $.99 a gallon or less in The 90's all while oil per gallon was what?  EXACTLY!!
#WWG1WGA #Qanon #QAnon8chan @realDonaldTrump
2507 2018-11-21 21:22:39 And when the Saudis quit using the American dollar for all of their oil industry? I'm sure you have an answer for that one
2508 2018-11-21 21:22:39 Yea def a matte foundation :/ probably not the wisest thing for me to get for the fall/winter season bc my freaking skin gets all crusty  but I’ll just use that farsail oil or whatever it’s called to mix in
2509 2018-11-21 21:22:37 Gas prices are not lower because of SA and the US only buys 11% of their oil. #facts
2510 2018-11-21 21:22:35 How to make fluffiest pancakes. 

4 tablespoon flour 
4tbspoon sugar 
1 egg 

U mix it well and add two tablespoons of milk when the batter appears too dry and mix well. 
Oil your pan. Just a drop of oil only if it’s a non stick pan. It better be a nonstick pan ok +
2511 2018-11-21 21:22:33 Accidental lol I only get the original one tho. Coconut oil has a way higher melting point tho it’s pretty stable at room temp, I’d say it’s cool
2512 2018-11-21 21:22:31 They tout innovation, but have sold the same product since it first became useful. Don’t take oil or coal employing companies at their word. It’s a matter of US Court Record what the word of filthy industry is worth.

2514 2018-11-21 21:22:24 So that was the deal? Give them a pass on murder and they will lower oil prices to make you and them look good?? . Awful
2515 2018-11-21 21:22:23 I am glad you are better. I know of many who use CBD oil and swear by it.
2516 2018-11-21 21:22:16 Just because you close an office likely because it has very little traffic, as the article points out it doesnt mean you're targeting them. But I guess $300,000 couldn't be used any better in Alabama, a poor state, than paying ppl to do practically nothing.
2517 2018-11-21 21:22:12 The US is the largest oil producer in the world and is now exporting oil, the US doesn't need Saudi oil. How many hundreds of billions did the feckless and spineless (red line in Syria) Obama give to Iran? You are sadly uninformed.
2518 2018-11-21 21:22:10 Cbd oil is my new friend.
2519 2018-11-21 21:22:08 Clueless boy band Justin doesn't set oil prices
2520 2018-11-21 21:22:03 Question... isnt the USA leading the world in oil production??? And I believe only 11% of the oil we use comes from Saudi Arabia... hell 40% comes from Canada...
2521 2018-11-21 21:22:01 Oil, which most of the US relies on, and expensive weapons deals. Oh and they're rich so Trump squirms around them like a pig
2522 2018-11-21 21:21:42 Also, clove oil? Depending on where the sores are in your mouth, might help to numb them a bit without tasting unbearably awful... Unless you touch your tongue to it (bleugh!), which might be sufficient to bring it to your conscious mind?
2523 2018-11-21 21:21:39 And we get most of out oil from Canada, so there’s that
2524 2018-11-21 21:21:36 Just because the GOVERMENT will pay less 4 oil. I ask will that be passed down to U.S.Citizens. ie. Oil and Gas. Or like always it will only be the GOVERMENT who will PROFIT & BENIFIT. My Educated guess it's only the GOV. "LIKE ALWAYS" SO NOT EXCITED!
2525 2018-11-21 21:21:30 #TheApprentice Never wear sunglasses in your top pocket. You look like snake oil salesman.
2526 2018-11-21 21:21:30 @realDonaldTrump Be nice to Canada. They give us 4 times as much oil as MBS. AND they don’t murdet our journalists. Traitor!
2527 2018-11-21 21:21:28 Trump just thanked the ISLAMIC Theocracy for low oil Prices; the Oil the US imports is mainly from Canada. %9 of crude oil imports come from the ISLAMIC theocracy of Saudi Arabia.
2528 2018-11-21 21:21:23 LMAO. That CBD oil is a joke. Stick to the real stuff!
2529 2018-11-21 21:21:19 It goes much lower and your Trump voter oil workers are gonna start getting laid off.
2530 2018-11-21 21:21:17 Canada supply’s more than Saudi Arabia does they only supply us about 8 percent of oil
2531 2018-11-21 21:21:14 To my followers: I'm looking for a reputable CBD oil store, any of y'all have recommendations?
2532 2018-11-21 21:21:10 I'd rather pay more for my gasoline and heating oil than have low prices paid for by the blood and death of Jamal Khasoggi!  Where the hell is your moral compass? 
2533 2018-11-21 21:21:08 Not in any way to defend 45 on Khashoggi, but we've been trading blood for cheap oil for decades in this country. Trump just first to state our moral compromise explicitly.
2534 2018-11-21 21:21:06 World oil glut. More supply than demand. You can fool some of the people but not an economics major who actually studied in college.
2535 2018-11-21 21:21:05 Lol! About the uziza, I didn’t see any fresh one so I didn’t bother. And yes I put a little more oil cos I like my soup to be ‘vibrant’. The Ogiri was lit! Thanks 
2536 2018-11-21 21:21:00 We import most of our oil from Canada.
2537 2018-11-21 21:20:56 I’m sure there’s an essential oil for that
2538 2018-11-21 21:20:55 Oil Ocean takes it for me.
2539 2018-11-21 21:20:52 My essential oils include olive oil and bacon grease.
2540 2018-11-21 21:20:39 So you're okay with murder in exchange for some barrels of oil?
2541 2018-11-21 21:20:39 Just hand over a few more of us for slaughter. Then it should drop even lower. Blood for oil.

2546 2018-11-21 21:20:23 Why is there no push on these oil companies to build refineries just pipelines.  We have to sell our product cheap and buy it back expensive.  This makes no sense.  Refine it here we are AB strong let’s prove it
2547 2018-11-21 21:20:12 Is that what you call your article, “journalism”?  Have you covered the lower LDL arm in R-I placebo group had more adverse events?  Seems like mineral oil helped statins work better at lowering LDL.  Is lower LDL really better?

2550 2018-11-21 21:20:03 Aren't u gonna mention oil money and corruption and human rights??   
Oh God I hope we beat them too! This place would be unbearable if they won the title 
2551 2018-11-21 21:20:01 The government doesn't give crap about our oil the west can't get them re elected and that's all they want right now but surprise the east doesn't want them either so goodbye
2552 2018-11-21 21:19:54 So I am sure you have never blamed the Middle East for high oil prices?  Because if you did you wouldn’t be following your own information
2553 2018-11-21 21:19:48 It’s amazing you can’t see through what SA is doing to you. They are buying you. Offering you less $ for oil so you forget abt an American citizen who they murdered. You have no spine and no morals.
2554 2018-11-21 21:19:48 We got a journalist murdered and you gave a free pass in exchange for cheaper oil. So, I don't think you are  qualified to talk anything about protection or security of our nation.
2555 2018-11-21 21:19:45 We buy 4x as much oil from Canada as we do Saudi Arabia.

If any US politician is bending over backwards for SA because of oil, they've been bought.
2556 2018-11-21 21:19:41 Plus we supply more oil than Saudi!!!   What the hell????
2557 2018-11-21 21:19:39 The problem is with his extreme arrogance... he can NEVER admit that he might not be right or have all the answers
2558 2018-11-21 21:19:37 40% of oil imported by the US is from Canada. 11% from SA. I think. (The CBC tweeted it). Your president is the worst. I often wake up and think ‘remember when the us elected... oh.. yeah that’s still a thing..’ ok I’m done now
2559 2018-11-21 21:19:35 @realDonaldTrump Can someone in the white house explain to Trump what lower oil prices do to the stock market, this correction has been exacerbated by lower oil prices & the current China tariffs & the January 1, possible 25% increase in China tariffs. people are losing big 401K
2560 2018-11-21 21:19:35 i never said that their problems aren’t valid but EVERYONE vegan or not funds that cruelty & the meat/dairy industry is cruel as well. do your research. i buy from farmers markets when i can, support local business, stopped buying palm oil, etc. what do you do?

2564 2018-11-21 21:19:13 Only 11% of all oil the US imports are from Saudi arabia aswell as everything coming from the middle east. Most oil is domestic and the Numbers one oil exporter to the US is canada followed by Mexico. No the US would be able to find that oil elsewhere and city its ties to SA

2572 2018-11-21 21:18:46 Thank you, Canada and the 40% of our oil that we get from you.

2575 2018-11-21 21:18:37 Keep getting the majority of oil from Canada like we already do!!! Next!
2576 2018-11-21 21:18:33 I antagonized a guard near the oil refinery until he took a swing at me, and punched his fucking lights out - and *still* got an honor penalty for it, even though I didn't technically throw the first punch. Which is how it should be! I was an asshole to that guy!
2577 2018-11-21 21:18:26 That’s in Arizona he is talking on a national average. Personally I don’t want to see cheap oil prices. It effects my job.

We only buy 11% of crude from Saudis ... You just sold out to Saudi $$$ over long standing US Moral Leadership !!

2581 2018-11-21 21:18:03 Hedy Donnie, when oil prices go lower those people involved in drilling in the US lose their jobs because of the margin required to be cost effective. FYI
2582 2018-11-21 21:18:01 Went to get my oil changed and he was choosing
2583 2018-11-21 21:17:53 @realDonaldTrump just to get the facts straight, we import 4x more oil from Canada  than Saudi Arabia!
2584 2018-11-21 21:17:51 Yes yes oil prices are going down, but so was the Dow. Mr. President, did you know that the Dow this week is performing the worst Thanksgiving week in the last 45 years. Wow, wonder why you’re not talking about this!!
2585 2018-11-21 21:17:46 There must be some body oil going on as well! Some product that is beneficial in some way and I’m late to the game. TBH I used to feel slippery as a dolphin by making the back of our bath into a slide using body wash 
2586 2018-11-21 21:17:44 Does this include pipeline export oil? Oh wait....we have our answers to that one.
2587 2018-11-21 21:17:40 If I'm not invited to shoot rabbits in the oil fields during Miller time tomorrow, going home will have been a waste
2588 2018-11-21 21:17:38 Donald Trump has just tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to 'a big Tax Cut for America and the World!' In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
2589 2018-11-21 21:17:36 Great to hear @ReclaimOurBard  and @ArtNotOil on BBC Radio 4 right now talking about the role of arts protests against Big Oil sponsorship.
2590 2018-11-21 21:17:33 @RachelNotley why are we not refining the majority of our oil here to make it a more desirable product ie more profitable product.  Why sell it for pennies

2592 2018-11-21 21:17:27 Thinking aloud how oil companies are going to feel about lower oil revenues.  Waiting for them to announce a new wave of layoffs!!!!
2593 2018-11-21 21:17:18 They’ve actually used this tactic before to attempt to bully other countries to lower their production and keep the Saudi share of the oil market as is.  Those are all facts.  Low oil prices hurts western producers beyond what it might do to Saudi Arabia’s welfare program.
2594 2018-11-21 21:17:13 merci (et avec toujours de nombreux commentaires passionnants)
2595 2018-11-21 21:17:11 I like the oil paintings #theapprentice
2596 2018-11-21 21:17:08 Yes. We have 2 choices: put up with the 12th century BS, or TAKE THEIR OIL. I am good with either decision. As far as 911 goes MBS tortured the hell out of a bunch of guys that were using their wealth to run their own Islamic foreign policy.
2597 2018-11-21 21:17:05 The only time I got mosquito bites this summer was when I didn’t have that oil on. It’s $3.99 (I think) & it’s everything.

2603 2018-11-21 21:16:43 You are a disgrace to the Presidency. Applauding the Saudis for oil?  What about denouncing them for what they did to the Journalist. You are praising dictators not our democracy. It’s Donald Trump first not America first. The Saudis invest in you not America. Liar, liar.

2610 2018-11-21 21:16:28 Not just Americans, however its certainly possible to greatly lower our dependency on oil thus returning much more leverage to be able to easily ditch SA.
2611 2018-11-21 21:16:22 Alberta is going to have a rude awakening one day if it don't broaden it's horizons beyond oil! It's never a good idea to put all your eggs in one basket, & fight with your Brother & Sisters.

2614 2018-11-21 21:16:17 If this was really true, you would be sucking up to Trudeau rather than MBS. We get 40% of our oil from Canada. Why would the so called president prefer to suck up to someone who commands people to use a bonesaw?

2618 2018-11-21 21:15:55 I used to oil deep fry, but a few years back I got an oil-less (infrared) deep fryer.  Gives very similar results but without the mess.  If you are roasting Spatchcocking is the way to go more even results.  Make sure you tweet a picture or two of the process/results.
2619 2018-11-21 21:15:52 is this supposed to have something to do with the price of oil ?
2620 2018-11-21 21:15:50 Because Prohibitionists have no substance. Just like bible thumpers. You hit them with facts. They just deny it. Even though it’s real. Like for the fact RIck Simpson oil cures kills cancer cells. It’s a proven fact. They will just say “no it’s not it’s a drug “

2634 2018-11-21 21:15:08 There's blood in that oil!
2635 2018-11-21 21:15:07 Since they supply about 10% of US oil and Canada supplies 40%, if this were a true reactive sentiment, he'd be thanking Canada first.

2637 2018-11-21 21:14:54 Natives were being tortured during thanksgiving last year trying to protect their water and are spending this year cleaning up an oil spill. There are no words for the injustices they go through. Ugh.
2638 2018-11-21 21:14:53 Tax money from shale production goes into federal coffers.  Also a fact.  Lower oil prices = less federal revenue.  Lower oil prices allow the Saudis to make a profit while causing other forms of oil production to go into the red such as shale and offshore drilling...
2639 2018-11-21 21:14:51 Liar Liar Pants on Fire. Actually the United States passed Saudi Arabia & Russia on production of oil. Total Bullshit Saudis responsible for lower gas prices. Watch Financial Channel. Just trying to justify Saudi & Crown Prince Murder of Reporter. Saudis bailed @POTUS out twice.
2640 2018-11-21 21:14:48 Let's not forget that much of this actually has to do with domestic oil in Texas. In fact Saudi Arabia is currently trying to drive oil price up, not down.
2641 2018-11-21 21:14:48 Oil City, PA You have my permission.
2642 2018-11-21 21:14:45 Spent about 5 minutes looking for layoffs. Haven't looked at construction or oil yet. But here's what a few minutes turned up. Starbucks,Ikea,Lowes,General Motors,Wells Fargo,Blue Cross/Blue Shield,Dr. Pepper,VT nuclear facility,Union Pacific,Nokia,Mayfield Dairy, -1
2643 2018-11-21 21:14:37 So should be under a $2 now. I think it got under $2 when Oil hit the $52 a barrel price under Obama
2644 2018-11-21 21:14:36 every year i’ve gotten paid the week of thanksgiving my paycheck came through on wednesday instead of friday... which is what i planned on happening today except IT HASN’T HIT YET AND I HAVE 2% OIL LIFE LEFT IN MY CAR
2645 2018-11-21 21:14:35 Ah I have some of those! Did it help you? I've just bought some lavender oil after reading about the benefits with anxiety so I'm hoping that will help. My test is booked for 11 and I have a quick lesson before so yay! xx
2646 2018-11-21 21:14:35 We sell them our weapons, and we buy the best oil on Earth from them.  How exactly does that make the US "Saudi Arabia's bitch"?
2647 2018-11-21 21:14:32 Oil prices are going up, you twit. You think because you said people are going to believe your lies. No way when they pay at the pump. You definitely are not playing with a full deck.
2648 2018-11-21 21:14:27 OIL PRICES?! REALLY?! YOU, SIR, ARE DEAD WRONG ABOUT KASHOGGI. KEEP IT UP AND i WON'T VOTE FOR YOU IN 2020.
2649 2018-11-21 21:14:26 Your corruption and lies continue to be exposed. 3800+ LIES now Me  oil. Bring on the money laundering investigations!
2650 2018-11-21 21:14:21 Stock prices are lower too— a much bigger drop than the drop in oil prices.  This is what happens when an incompetent gets elected President
2651 2018-11-21 21:14:12 Praising the Saudis to mollify them in exchange for Oil is not ok....their human rights record is abysmal, their involvement in terrorism is criminal. A little backbone from POTUS would be great
2652 2018-11-21 21:14:11 Have you tried their lavender body scrub or lemongrass body oil?
2653 2018-11-21 21:14:10 a bird died in our walk in bird cage so i tried to get in to take it out but the birds freaked out and one got out and now its being chased by 2 crows also i spilled oil on my face and i have a big ol burn mark (((-:
2654 2018-11-21 21:14:10 I plead ignorance, but isn't it OPEC and not solely your business friend Saudi Arabia that control oil prices?
2655 2018-11-21 21:14:07 Kinda sad knowing there are really talented oil painters out there making less money than people who blindly put paint on a canvas. Yes, I get it's a form of expression, but the effort that does into intricate art is immense #theapprentice
2656 2018-11-21 21:14:06 The majority of our imported oil comes from Canada, dimwit
2657 2018-11-21 21:14:02 Really it makes it sound like he did a quid pro quo. We’ll overlook the grisly murder; you lower the oil prices
2658 2018-11-21 21:13:55 Oh you mean like oil from other countries?! Milk from the US, electronics from Asia?? You didn’t touch a nerve at all, you just proved how out of touch with reality you are and I don’t need to waste my time with a “true Canadian “ like you.
2659 2018-11-21 21:13:54 It's basically black tea with orange rind oil (bergamot) ~ sounds strange i know but the bergamot is my favourite part hehe it's sooo soothing
2660 2018-11-21 21:13:54 The Saudis butchered a lovely journalist and @realDonaldTrump is thanking them for oil prices. This man breastfeeds from the devil’s teat.
2661 2018-11-21 21:13:45 You are so whacked out of your mind! Okay... What if he is Muslim? Who cares?!!! He is past, no longer relevant. Speaking of bowing... Your cheato just excused the brutal murder of a journalist for lower oil prices. Grab that straw and grasp it hard.
2662 2018-11-21 21:13:42 Take the veggies out of the pan add tablespoon olive oil to the pan along with garlic and thyme. stir for a minute, add in a tablespoon of butter and the lemon juice and wine, let it reduce down a bit then throw the veggies back into the pan with the sauce until warm then serve.
2663 2018-11-21 21:13:30 Price of crude oil dropping, hmmmm
2664 2018-11-21 21:13:29 Finna treat my truck finna wash her oil change and a full tank
2665 2018-11-21 21:13:13 I’m sure this is the sentiment of many Miamians. This Thanksgiving, #BigHighway, Big Oil, and the auto industry are thankful that @MayorGimenez et al. may well have set transit in Miami back an *entire generation*. Battle won in the #WarOnNonCars, a victory for climate deniers!
2666 2018-11-21 21:13:12 yes eyebrows get in the way  have you tried putting castor oil on them??
2667 2018-11-21 21:13:10 You can save a lot of money checking your own oil level/quality. Sometimes those lights are based on milage, not actual oil quality. Or perhaps you were just low. Also, I know it can be daunting, but changing oil is one of the easiest things to DIY.
2668 2018-11-21 21:13:09 Oil prices are benchmarked on global supply. Saudis increase the global supply and the price we pay to the Canadian oil companies goes down.
2669 2018-11-21 21:13:06 What matters is how much oil is produced globally. If SA (or Russia) double their production that definitely reduces US prices even if the US doesn't import a single gallon of oil from them
2670 2018-11-21 21:13:02 Falling prices are costing American oil producers $$$. Small ones stopping pumping. Exports falling; trade balance rising.
What an idiot. Hurting American businesses for a little to brag about.
2671 2018-11-21 21:13:00 You do realize that Newfoundland just had a massive spill that maybe impossible to clean up from oil and gas right?
2672 2018-11-21 21:12:59 The price is low because there is an oversupply which originates in the USA and the Middle East. Oil which is easier to extract and refine is worth more.  It has nothing to do with politics. Monocultures are fragile, time to divest from fossil and invest in diverse energy supply!
2673 2018-11-21 21:12:59 I always list him as Snake Oil Salesman
2674 2018-11-21 21:12:58 No we wouldn't I doubt the eu wouldn't want the biggest oil producer out side the eu
2675 2018-11-21 21:12:50 Kale chips all the way.  Flavoured with good olive oil and spices.... yum!
2676 2018-11-21 21:12:50 Picking hairs but I think  Fracking is better environmentally than shale oil extraction as it requires a lot of energy, but the Scots did more than their fair share of inventing ,a brilliant find Colin.
Shame socialism was invented and sent north
2677 2018-11-21 21:12:47 No president has any effect on OPEC or oil prices ,it is supply and demand,  you don't do shit dude
2678 2018-11-21 21:12:38 I have.  I wanted to ask you about yours to see where I can learn something.  From what I know it could provide some but not all.  

I don't think hemp has the same chemical composition as oil.
2679 2018-11-21 21:12:29 Great news....unless you work in the oil business.   What a maroon.
2680 2018-11-21 21:12:29 You lack a fundamental understanding of environmental issues 
Getting oil based products from outside the US doesn't help our environment.
That leads to continued use of fossil based fuels...
2681 2018-11-21 21:12:24 I don't know of any specific desert recipes, however, when I bake, I substitute with egg replacer and rice milk. Anything calling for butter, I use sunflower seed oil instead.
2682 2018-11-21 21:12:20 African pastors are professional thieves. they steal from poor passive people in day light.

recently there is an African pastor who claims he invented Aids cureguess what?that Nibba will even sell you 50ml of useless oil for $500 
2683 2018-11-21 21:12:18 Saudi Arabia has the world’s cheapest extraction costs which results in higher profits. Their oil is very close to the surface.
2684 2018-11-21 21:12:13 Just had this pizza at Southampton branch. You advertise Truffle, but it’s Truffle Oil. Not a truffle in sight.................... good job your staff at this branch are exceptional #trufflepizzapants
2685 2018-11-21 21:12:11 Me too--and drive less. No blood for oil!
2686 2018-11-21 21:12:09 Understand that oil is elastic to supply and demand as economy improves demand increases and supply will chase it. Supply has caught up thus prices are dropping some. It has nothing to do with Trump
2687 2018-11-21 21:12:07 The US gets more oil from our neighbors to the north than Saudi Arabia, so @realDonaldTrump should be thanking Canada!
2688 2018-11-21 21:12:02 We only get 10-12% of our oil from Saudi Arabia and 40%+ from Canada who he refuses to partner with. This is about his personal economy, not the country’s. Go sit down.
2689 2018-11-21 21:12:02 bwiset! sana oil. gising pa kami dito oh.
2690 2018-11-21 21:11:56 #TheApprentice
The oil paintings and line drawings are crap. I wouldn't give them house room.
2691 2018-11-21 21:11:56 This wee man looks a laugh though! Yeah hopefully she’s ok, poured luke warm salty water on it a few times with tee tree oil and then anti septic but couldn’t get the sock on it! At least it’s clean and we’ll see if she’s still limping in the morning 
2692 2018-11-21 21:11:46 “who said something about oil bitch you cooking?” 
2693 2018-11-21 21:11:44 oil paintings?????there crap #theapprentice
2694 2018-11-21 21:11:44 Who cares about oil prices when actual gas prices are still too high!
2695 2018-11-21 21:11:41 That his not was his tweet saying are you saying Saudi has no control of oil prices
2696 2018-11-21 21:11:40 Tell that to the thousands of oil workers around the nation. I'm sure they will be thrilled about the prospect of losing their jobs in the near future.
2697 2018-11-21 21:11:37 Oil filters.
2698 2018-11-21 21:11:34 What happened to “take the oil”, I guess more tough talk from a chump. Meanwhile he sanctions Iran’s oil off the market while resorting to appeasement with the Saudis. It’s pathetic...
2699 2018-11-21 21:11:33 Between the oil we get from Canada, and the Gulf, the fact is Saudi Arabia only represents 11% of US imported oil, yet you ball wash the Saudi Crowned assassin, thanking him for something he had nothing to do with! This is yet another attempt to deflect the truth of his crimes!
2700 2018-11-21 21:11:33 The Saudis make money off their oil at $11/ barrels.  That’s a fact.  If the profits from their oil doesn’t cover their government programs that’s a separate matter entirely.  Fracking oil production is much more costly so oil needs to be higher in order for it to be viable...
2701 2018-11-21 21:11:32 Fairly quiet markets today as Europe and NY stocks remained calm ahead of the long weekend. We saw USD retrace some of the gains from Tuesday with commodity currencies the biggest winners as Oil stabilised. EUR swung around 1.1400 for most of the day due to large expiries.
2702 2018-11-21 21:11:25 Yooooo dude has a neck the size of an oil pipeline.
2703 2018-11-21 21:11:22 You idiot we buy less than 10% oil from Saudi Arabia has nothing to do with the Texas Crudo price which is at $54 a barrel much less than that will hurt production in America because it cost anywhere from $30-$60 a barrel to produce oil in this
2704 2018-11-21 21:11:18 We 40% of our oil from Canada. Only 9% from Saudi Arabia.
He’s kissing the wrong ass.
2705 2018-11-21 21:11:17 It was TWO YEARS AGO, but if memory serves me correct....we went to war in Iraq because of Oil and Money. The WMDs were a lie. Are you going to keep rehashing the past or do you maybe want to face what's going on in the present???
2706 2018-11-21 21:11:16 Won't lie to you. Fresh from a shower, with my blueberry shampoo, gifted Lush shower gel, coconut hand scrub, and coconut oil, I smell positively edible right now.
2707 2018-11-21 21:11:16 @PnPCBC money for media outlets, not a dime to@support the oil and gas industry. We’re watching the death of our oil and gas industry
2708 2018-11-21 21:11:15 True. He would have traded ya for better price on oil.
2709 2018-11-21 21:11:12 What kind of shitty oil do you use that it needs to be changed 4 times a year?

Technology has come a long way, that we don’t need to change it every 3 months any more.
2710 2018-11-21 21:11:08 Mâle America great again . oïl in  Afghanistan is  now. Credo un unum deum.
2711 2018-11-21 21:11:07 Are you serious?!  I’ve never heard of that problem. Do you pay with a brush or your finger? Sometimes if I have too much oil on my lids, I use my finger to pat it in and that works better
2712 2018-11-21 21:11:06 I like the oil paintings. A little Francis Bacon #theapprentice
2713 2018-11-21 21:11:05 I stopped taking fish oil pills cuz they wouldn't digest in my system. So, no, totally different experience.
2714 2018-11-21 21:11:03 You did not heat the oil well before frying stew. You aint woman enough. Bye. #CrazyBreakupLines
2715 2018-11-21 21:10:58 You stole my lamp oil AND my rupees!
Bombs is all i have!
2716 2018-11-21 21:10:55 That data is out of date. US is (effectively) a net exporter of oil. The only imports are pricing arbitrage between different grades of oil and regional crack spreads. Besides, to say that physical oil is imported from places other than SA is largely irrelevant with global prices
2717 2018-11-21 21:10:53 Something inherently smug about adding salt and oil to your pasta, feel like a culinary genius using tricks of the trade only you and gordon ramsay know about
2718 2018-11-21 21:10:49 With oil depreciation there goes the stock market. It’s better to have higher oil prices and keep the stock market pumping along rather than sinking to the depths as it is right now 
2719 2018-11-21 21:10:47 Sorry to hear about that. I know how debilitating those headaches can be. I hope they subside for you soon.

Just wanted to share something though in case. I have been using hemp seed oil capsules lately. It has helped with my fibromyalgia pain, including headaches.
2720 2018-11-21 21:10:42 Fairly quiet markets today as Europe and NY stocks remained calm ahead of the long weekend. We saw USD retrace some of the gains from Tuesday with commodity currencies the biggest winners as Oil stabilised. EUR swung around 1.1400 for most of the day due to large expiries.
2721 2018-11-21 21:10:40 Why don’t they sell Homer Formby’s Tung Oil finish at Lowe’s anymore?
2722 2018-11-21 21:10:39 Trump: Thank you so much Saudi Arabia for lowering our oil prices. 

Saudi Arabia: You're entirely welcome. Thank you for covering our ass.

Trump: The pleasure is all mine. What can I do for you next? 

Saudi Arabia: ha ha ha ha ha (You are all mine)

Which country is next??!
2723 2018-11-21 21:10:39 You got it wrong! Thanks ignorance!! Canada sells 6.4% of total oil exports in the world, while saudi Arabia own the biggest share in the market with almost 16% . I really laugh when i see how u calculate the world oil price by looking at the US imports only. Go educate yourself!
2724 2018-11-21 21:10:38 andalanku tea tree oil tbs kakdel. jerawat go away
2725 2018-11-21 21:10:38 There is nothing specific for the oil patch in the fall update despite govt acknowledging Alberta’s pain. Govt officials argue the capital write offs on investment will help as AB has high level of Corp capital spending and feds point to purchasing Trans Mountain #cdnpoli
2726 2018-11-21 21:10:34 This is stupidity, oil prices depends on INTERNATIONAL SUPPLIES. If Saudi Arabia cut productions, ALL oil prices AROUND THE WORLD would increase as a result.
2727 2018-11-21 21:10:32 Why is banning diamonds that are found by slaves in a third-world country different from importing oil from an obscenely rich country with an obscenely backward culture? I dunno, something about the richest people and corporations get whatever they want? Again, ask the Irvings.
2728 2018-11-21 21:10:29 She’s been drinking the oil paint #TheApprentice
2729 2018-11-21 21:10:28 I think you mean THANK YOU CANADA. Saudi Arabia is raising their prices and only provides a fraction of the oil in comparison to what Canada provides us.
2730 2018-11-21 21:10:28 Only 11% of our oil comes from them, thank you Canada (40%0
2731 2018-11-21 21:10:27 I hope You all will run out of oil and gas soon and the. The countries that have invented in green energy will have the power.
2732 2018-11-21 21:10:23 Yeah I don’t think the Saudis will output any more. They want oil at $80/barrel. Any less than the current price and they’re leaving money on the table. I guess this is the price they pay for Trump to look the over way regarding Jamal Khashoggi.
2733 2018-11-21 21:10:22 That’s all very true, however, Canada does not controlled oil prices. OPEC does. That said, is there no escape from the daily embarrassment that the orangutan creates?
2734 2018-11-21 21:10:21 Trump, you sell America short. You THANK Saudi Arabia for the oil when it is a known fact that the Saudi crown Prince ordered the MURDER of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. YOU ARE CONDONING HIS MURDER and sending a message that our morality is up for sale if the price is right. Shame
2735 2018-11-21 21:10:19 I don't see the difference between oil and Daniel. Not blagging, nauseating son

2741 2018-11-21 21:09:46 Hey Donnie - we get 40% of our oil from Canada and about 10% from the effin Saudi’s - genius!

The US is producing more oil than ever - you want people to believe that prices are down because of something you did! No what you did was to benefit you and Jared!

Unstable idiot!
2742 2018-11-21 21:09:44 @IcelandFoods has done SO much for awareness of palm oil.

2745 2018-11-21 21:09:41 We get 40% of our oil from Canada and only 9% from Saudi Arabia. You should be praising Canada 
2746 2018-11-21 21:09:38 This romaine epidemic is a perfect time for me to get on my soapbox about the often forgotten ARUGULA CAESAR... KALE is made for soup and losers but ARUGULA has a crisp taste that COMPLIMENTS an OIL BASED CAESAR DRESSING WELL! Thank you and HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL!!!!!!
2747 2018-11-21 21:09:37 What is he worried about, America gets more oil from Canada than the Saudis.
2748 2018-11-21 21:09:37 It doesn't make it any less bad, but let's also not pretend like the US condoning the killing of innocent people in exchange for cheap oil has not been continuously happening for decades.
2749 2018-11-21 21:09:32 You might have an oil leak....

2751 2018-11-21 21:09:27 You should be being nicer to Canada. 40% of our oil imports are from them. Only 9% is from Saudi Arabia. Please read more.

2755 2018-11-21 21:09:16 Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't we only get like 11% of our oil from them? I thought WE were the biggest oil manufacturer at this point. Unbelievable.

2767 2018-11-21 21:08:46 Why are you thanking Saudi Arabia?  Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.

2769 2018-11-21 21:08:38 Unfortunately when neighbours are 200 yds apart, its not just vans that are a worry- oil tanks can be emptied, granite troughs & mushrooms taken, usually in the small hours- Its like being under siege sometimes-Unless you spend £000's difficult to protect against
2770 2018-11-21 21:08:37 We’re the largest producer of oil in the world. The fuck is he thanking Saudi’s for.
2771 2018-11-21 21:08:35 I didn't even realize there was a discussion about this, but it makes perfect sense! The problem isn't that highways are too narrow, it's suburban sprawl, decentralized cities, and over-reliance on cars thanks to car companies, oil companies, developers, and roadwork contractors.
2772 2018-11-21 21:08:33 “Oh that advert is so sad. I’ll definitely give up palm oil.”

You know chocolate, bread, ice cream, lipstick etc etc have palm oil in it right? 

“Oh. Well, ok, I’ll like, share it on social media and maybe someone else will give it up instead?!”
2773 2018-11-21 21:08:24 When #GasPrices go down we have more disposable income, so yes in a way it feels like a #TaxCut regardless of politics.
I  OUR @POTUS is putting pressure on the #MiddleEast #OilMonopoly to bring down the price of Oil.
why? Want to pay higher gas prices?
2774 2018-11-21 21:08:22 US #crude #oil #inventory volume for week ending 11/16 was 446.9 million #barrels, up from prev. week by 4.9 million bbl or 1.1%; down from prev. year by -2.2%
2775 2018-11-21 21:08:22 Is there anywhere in Dublin that I can buy Palestinian olive oil?
2776 2018-11-21 21:08:19 We gon give it to them anyhow just like the old folks made us drink that castor oil 
2777 2018-11-21 21:08:10 1/4 cup or more lemon juice, 2-4 cloves of garlic minced, 1/4 cup white wine, thyme fresh or dry, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley 
pound asparagus is for four servings and a basket of tomatoes. 
Heat pan with olive oil medium high. Toss in veggies cook for about 5 mins
2778 2018-11-21 21:08:10 Is Bio Oil any good? I have stretch marks all over me and they're getting worse :(
2779 2018-11-21 21:08:08 Not buying into Trump’s latest Snake Oil...
2780 2018-11-21 21:08:08 You got played. There’s a glut of oil in the world, supply is outstripping demand, and meanwhile China is doubling down on solar and wind. You are a dinosaur.
2781 2018-11-21 21:08:03 They refused giving me red oil n boiled yam
2782 2018-11-21 21:08:02 oil is a global commodity and its price is set internationally. any supply disruption especially from the major producers has a huge impact on prices. But  you already know all these.
2783 2018-11-21 21:08:01 So it’s not oil that’s making Trump siding with Saudi. Is it just narcissism?
2784 2018-11-21 21:07:58 I get so anxious taking my car for an oil change. Like.. “What’s wrong now?” Lmao :/
2785 2018-11-21 21:07:54 Coconut oil.
2786 2018-11-21 21:07:53 Umm ok but see I've paying 3 dollars a gallon for gas for months now. If oil prices are going down it hasn't had any direct affect on my wallet. Mind you they were down around 2.25 before your ass came along.
2787 2018-11-21 21:07:46 @CTVNews makes me sick, as sick as I get when I hear any lying, corrupt #LPC MP speak like today in QP - moron CTV talking say oil price hurts Alberta- true but it hurts all of Canada you idiot! Now with fraud budget update- #CTV morons just regurgitate same #LPC lies,
2788 2018-11-21 21:07:44 You do realize the majority of your oil comes from Canada?
2789 2018-11-21 21:07:43 Never mind we don't need Saudi oil at all! We produce plenty here and buy enough from Canada, one of our ALLIES, that happens to be our neighbor!!
2790 2018-11-21 21:07:40 Must have missed the market crash! I guess you want to claim credit for oil prices in behalf of your murderous Saudi friends, except we get most of our oil from Canada.
2791 2018-11-21 21:07:37 Found a few investors for our oil. This could be huge for our country and our economy. Don’t sleep on us 
2792 2018-11-21 21:07:30 To let people understand that it is a problem. Just like recycling ads want people to recycle to save the planet and the sea, this ad just simply would like to make people aware to reduce the mass buying of products that promote unsustainable palm oil to save animal habitats
2793 2018-11-21 21:07:22 Yes they killed someone, we do nothing, and they lower oil. There is a sick deal
2794 2018-11-21 21:07:11 Idea 4 you
Homemade Pumpkin Bread-2 loaves
16 oz can of canned pumpkin
3 ½  cups of all-purpose flour
2 tsp. baking soda
3 cups of sugar
4 eggs
1 cup of veg. oil
1 ½ tsp. salt
2 tsp. cinnamon
2 tsp. nutmeg
½ tsp. allspice
2/3 cups of water
350 F. 
2-9x5 loaf pans Mix-Bake 1 hr
2795 2018-11-21 21:07:11 Most of Canada's oil comes from shale. Under approximately 70 dollars a barrel it becomes too expensive to extract. Facts don't bother you, do they?
2796 2018-11-21 21:07:10 No you have got it wrong boy band Justin doesn't set oil prices the Saudi's and other Arab nations do. Please don't talk about topics you clearly know nothing about
2797 2018-11-21 21:07:07 We give thanks for addressing the price of oil & the price of petroleum products, such as gasoline. Instead of reminding us that foreign countries pay more & that we should be grateful. Actually working to lower the price that average USA citizens pay. Thank you.
2798 2018-11-21 21:07:04 Hey @realDonaldTrump obviously you failed to read another memo, we only get 11% of our oil from Saudi Arabia,we get 40% of our oil from CANADA! So THANK YOU CANADA!"for the big Tax Cut for America.." We apologize on behalf of trump he has a real problem with truth and facts! #
2799 2018-11-21 21:07:01 Can you go lower than murder, dismemberment and lying? ... because that's already pretty low. I don't think I would be thanking them either but when you value oil over people, I can see how you would be excited.
2800 2018-11-21 21:06:57 Seemed pleased to exchange the death of a reporter for a better price on oil
2801 2018-11-21 21:06:56 Hey dummy @realDonaldTrump... the bulk of US oil comes from Canada. You're welcome 
2802 2018-11-21 21:06:48 All the gains on stock markets have vanished, so now he as to find something else to brag about, thing is making their oil cheap ruins it for the use oil barrels lol dead clever trump, how much does yer son in law make out of this deal
2803 2018-11-21 21:06:45 Yeah and as always trying to get an oil engineer is like trying to find rocking horse shit.
2804 2018-11-21 21:06:29 But oil is king
2805 2018-11-21 21:06:27 We French people ask you to denounce the French president policy about oil taxes please :( This incompetent wants to increase taxes whereas oil cost is even more lower.
2806 2018-11-21 21:06:21 The painting is old so I think it might be oil. The brush techniques look to me more oil then watercolor
2807 2018-11-21 21:06:18 MSNBC. Discussion Trump‘s love affair with Saudi crown prince. Trump said we need oil from Saudi Arabia. Wrong, United States is number one producer of oil. Relationship with Saudi Arabia is financial and criminal. My heart goes out to all  loving caring people of the Middle East
2808 2018-11-21 21:06:18 Most of our oil is imported from Canada only 9% from Saudi Arabia...what are you really thanking them for
2809 2018-11-21 21:06:16 It is so foolish that we are selling our oil to the US at pennies on the dollar for them to sell at a huge profit when we could be refining and boosting our economy on our own. Top that of the money wasted buying oil from saudi instead of using our own.
2810 2018-11-21 21:05:54 Oil hasn't traded $82 since 2014. 

I guess when you have zero clue about what your talking about, this might make sense.
2811 2018-11-21 21:05:52 Not due 2 Saudi Arabia!  Due 2 excess supply. U.S. gets 60% of its oil from Canada. We refine our own 2. U.S. NOT dependent on Saudi 4 oil. In addition Saudis r cutting supply 2 raise prices. Finally, gas is NOT cheap in many areas. @realDonaldTrump doesn't know about prices!!
2812 2018-11-21 21:05:47 also my bosses dad owns a little beekeeping farm and she bought me back a proper beeswax and oil lipbalm and i am sO IN LOVE I NEED MORE OF THESE??
2813 2018-11-21 21:05:45 Based on what ive read, We actually only get about 11% crude oil from SA and 40% of it from Canada.
2814 2018-11-21 21:05:44 Saudi Arabia has America in the palm of their hands. Oil is a blessing and a curse.
2815 2018-11-21 21:05:41 This is totally dishonest. Why would you thank Saudi Arabia when we get less than 10% of our oil from them?  You are just trying to make Saudi Arabia look good. I think most Americans are smart enough to see this as is misleading information. You call it fake news..
2816 2018-11-21 21:05:39 Nah palm oil u use
2817 2018-11-21 21:05:39 The US needing SA is nothing new and has been such forever and just like China and US ultimately rely on each other economically, US needs to keep the House of Saud stable being things like oil prices count on it.
2818 2018-11-21 21:05:38 it still has cbd oil
2819 2018-11-21 21:05:27 Still can NOT make all those things without....WAIT FOR IT..... 
OIL!!!
OBTUSE AGAIN EDDY...
Just like Leo brags about driving electric glamorous cars.
How much oil, and energy and manpower did it take to build these things?
2820 2018-11-21 21:05:24 it just feels so wrong to me, and makes me so sad v.v Artists have to work so hard to make things work, and compared to oil painters and still life artists, furry artists receive so little for their work v.v to have someone not pay them is just wrong. so so wrong.
2821 2018-11-21 21:05:18 Headlines, oil prices cut with bone saw!
2822 2018-11-21 21:05:06 WHY does CBD oil have to taste soooooo rank 
2823 2018-11-21 21:05:05 Candain doller fell big time loonie is down make every one pooooooooooooooor $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ cheep holes to stay a night    oil fell big time $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ candan doller fell big time $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
2824 2018-11-21 21:05:04 Spread love, just as you would spread oil in your hair... or on your body... or on your partners body.
2825 2018-11-21 21:05:04 Never mind their stock holdings in oil..
2826 2018-11-21 21:05:01 Maris pipers, par boil, good hot oil. If there's no vegetarians, I'll cook them alongside the meat.
2827 2018-11-21 21:04:58 @potus: before you claim you are keeping Oil Prices down bc of your support of  SA, know that CANADA gives us at least 40%! The largest sources of U.S. imported oil: Canada (40%), Saudi Arabia (11%), Venezuela (9%), Mexico (8%), and Colombia (4%)
2828 2018-11-21 21:04:57 Even though the bulk of oil purchased by america is from Canada at 40% compared to SA 11%
2829 2018-11-21 21:04:57 We EXPORT 70k of tge worlds oil. Get a grip. No matter what, your tds kicks
2830 2018-11-21 21:04:55 Yeah we disagree. To be fair, presidents always get blamed for high gas prices and praised for low gas prices but they actually don't have much to do with it. But we don't import much oil from Saudi Arabia, only about 9%, and I don't think this current price drop is due to Saudis
2831 2018-11-21 21:04:55 Win Jan canola up A$1.46/t but EU rape down A$2.07. As is usual US soybns lifted ahead of Thanksgiving with help from a lower US$ & lift in share mkts. Biofuels got support from a lift in crude oil.
2832 2018-11-21 21:04:43 Let me add some logic here, when Saudi pumps more oil, oil prices drop whether its Canadian or Saudi or whatever. When Saudi pumps less oil, oil prices rise. So Canada selling 40% crude has no relationship to price of oil
2833 2018-11-21 21:04:41 how come the palm oil issue is only just coming to light when it’s been a problem for years and years? shows our generation is so highly influenced by what they see online that it’s the only way to get through
2834 2018-11-21 21:04:33 Another one of your lies masquerading as the truth. “Oil prices have plunged 30 percent since early October, dragged lower by a broader market sell-off and growing consensus that supply will outstrip demand next year.” (CNBC article dated 11/21)
2835 2018-11-21 21:04:32 OMG Trump just went after the Chief Justice “you do have Obama judges” blah blah!  He is willing to take down anything for his own glory! #TrumpChumps wake up because he will turn on them as he has farmers, oil industry ports, manufacturers, veterans, Allies, Murder victims
2836 2018-11-21 21:04:32 America could support Green Energy and stop producing oil products and save the world's life, but 'Greed' is the most precious resource made in the USA.
2837 2018-11-21 21:04:29 Canada is our biggest exporter of oil to us.  Saudi oil is at about 9%.  Another Trump lie to make us believe that he is the one getting the Saudis to lower the price at the pump.  Lock him up already!!
2838 2018-11-21 21:04:26 Do what's the pricetag on a tortured dismembered life these days? A barrel of oil?
2839 2018-11-21 21:04:22 Moisturising Rooibos & Shea Facial Cleansing Bar, Argan oil (use as your daily facial moisturizer accompanied by SPF at all times), Avocado Moisturising Overnight Serum (use daily at night after cleansing) and Pore Contracting Gel Mask + Vegan mask brush (use once/twice a week)
2840 2018-11-21 21:04:22 Only if your company shareholders allow it, it's been restricted by oil companies for decades. Instead of invading oil bearing nations, it will be countries with lithium deposits, ........ Of wait, Afghanistan has already been taken over as a pre cursor to oil drop off.
2841 2018-11-21 21:04:21 That’s how to bring the price down. Competition! OPEC monopolized crude oil.
2842 2018-11-21 21:04:21 That’s not even needed. The price of of oil is set by the market, not relations between nations. 
2843 2018-11-21 21:04:20 Dipwad we only get 11% of our oil from Saudi Arabia.
2844 2018-11-21 21:04:20 Another $20 and you'll have oil prices as low as Obama. Until the last couple weeks, they've gone up your entire presidency. 

BTW, Saudi and OPEC are going to give you the finger starting December. Saudi's going to pump 1MM barrels a day LESS.
2845 2018-11-21 21:04:18 You might like to use a hydrating toner after you work out just to get rid of oil and sweat without drying ur skin out.
2846 2018-11-21 21:04:18 @CBCAlerts Donald Trump has just tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to 'a big Tax Cut for America and the World!' In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
2847 2018-11-21 21:04:17 Would be interested to find out how many people have given up palm oil since they’re so outraged by the #IcelandAdvert 
Sick of people pretending to give a shit about the world merely for a front on social media 
2848 2018-11-21 21:04:17 So... local fire house burnt on a holiday a few years ago. (Obscuring to protect the relatively innocent adrenalin junkies who make up most volunteer fire departments).

Official story was electrical fault.

Rumor in the EMS-fire community was turkey + extra oil. Archimedes fail.
2849 2018-11-21 21:04:16 Let’s make something perfectly clear DTs lies r growing monster ably. We only get 9% of our OiL from his BFF MBS n they’re not buying hundreds of billions of dollars 14.6 billion in projected arms sales they’re buying millions n millions of dollars from DT n Family!JUST STOP
2850 2018-11-21 21:04:15 The President of the US has the best interests of  Americans . We don't want oil prices to Skyrocket.  you don't seem to think that's important Eric but it is
2851 2018-11-21 21:04:11 Oil really nose dived & I was nowhere to be seen..... Smh!! I really need to stop playing & get that trading journal.. FUCK!!
2852 2018-11-21 21:04:11 It’s not ignoring the need for oil,  it’s getting started on a transition: for major resources in research and innovation . We have left those things so long that now we’re in a life altering crunch and haven’t all the tools we need.
2853 2018-11-21 21:04:10 Yeah I guess, I think social media and the world are getting way too sensitive. I understand the politics of the business in palm oil but I see no harm in creating a little cartoon (slightly aimed at young minds which are the ones with the potential to change the future)
2854 2018-11-21 21:04:08 Saudis supply 9% of America’s oil supply. Canada supplies 40% and is treated badly. Numbers were on the View. He’s made so much money on Saudi it’s a crime, also posted on the View. It’s Trump first.
2855 2018-11-21 21:04:05 That's not how it works. A tweet of you doesn't change the oil price. Try covering for more murders.
2856 2018-11-21 21:04:03 Except that Canada supplies most of our oil. But don't let facts get in the way of making another idiotic statement for the rubes.
2857 2018-11-21 21:04:01 Did the president get Saudi to drop oil prices by $30/barrel as a penalty for kashoggi?  So like penalizing this Saudi ruling family in a way that benefits American citizens? Wouldn’t that be refreshing?
2858 2018-11-21 21:04:00 Donald Trump’s Bizarro World: N. America (US, Canada, Mexico) produces all the oil it needs. Why is he thanking the Saudis for the low oil prices? Who’s he trying to fool?
2859 2018-11-21 21:03:46 Pep Boys really be tryna play me EVERY TIME I come get an oil change. He asked me if I wanted to change my air filter and I literally JUST got one the last time I was here. 
Don’t play with me. Scamming ass.
2860 2018-11-21 21:03:45 Ouch! Hope it heals fast, and since I burn myself so often in my art, I recommend lavender oil. It kills the burn! 

Or you'll just be really relaxed as you chew your own knuckle.
2861 2018-11-21 21:03:45  I’m not liking my hair.... it’s thinned out to almost baby thin hair!! WTF! It used to be extra thick & curly too. Besides black Jamaican castor oil, what else to use? I’ll be getting some more BJCO next week & go back to using it regularly.
2862 2018-11-21 21:03:39 Please, President Trump, please don’t keep dropping oil! I am a widower living off a very little oil check!
2863 2018-11-21 21:03:38 Well i do find you a tad on the negative side. Even if the team does something good you are not one to embrace it. Always looking for the next bad thing that’s bound to happen. That being said, the Oilers have always delivered on that “next bad thing”
2864 2018-11-21 21:03:37 Or that you guys get significantly more oil from Canada?
2865 2018-11-21 21:03:34 They are for roasting slowly, then layered with fresh mozzarella and paper-thin garlic, sprinkled with basil, drizzled with olive oil and dusted with black pepper and sea salt, atop an airy, lightly toasted, thick slab of sourdough.
2866 2018-11-21 21:03:34 I love chili oil! (*ﾉ▽ﾉ)
I could just drink it straight from the bottle!
2867 2018-11-21 21:03:33 Full body massages after she come home from work go a long way trust me. Add the hot coconut oil n it’s OV
2868 2018-11-21 21:03:32 Hold up one minute......have to grab my anointing oil lol
2869 2018-11-21 21:03:31 WTF I hate lower oil prices now!?!
2870 2018-11-21 21:03:30 You’re misleading America (again)Saudi Arabia has very little to do with the prices at American gas pumps..we only get 10 %of our oil from them.
Most of our oil comes from Canada or from our own production.
You had nothing to do with it...fool!
2871 2018-11-21 21:03:30 But ye could bate it with a good col bottla neck oil
2872 2018-11-21 21:03:24 Also, is this like National Postmedia Oil Day or something??
2873 2018-11-21 21:03:24 No! F**k Saudi Arabia. They owe US! So we sell them arms and now somehow we have to kiss their ass? Without the civilized world SA would be a windswept desert. Oh wait... It still is. Ok maybe we stop buying their oil? But the top 4 WH guys were bought by SA.
2874 2018-11-21 21:03:22 I believe it is solely for personal gain that he is doing this not for arms deals or oil. The Saudis & Russia own trump because of his past business dealings with them, including money laundering.
2875 2018-11-21 21:03:22 OK. So how is the Canadian oil price set? It’s it affected by global oil supply and demand?
2876 2018-11-21 21:03:20 “Hurt not the oil & the wine.”

Generally I don’t have aproblem with folks using the teachings of Jesus to achieve peace. I do have a problem with the severe lack of respect apparent when people plagiarize his teachings because they can’t face the past evil of their own heritage.
2877 2018-11-21 21:03:19 This isn't a Trump issue. Countries don't go to war or cut diplomatic ties because one person is assassinated unless they are looking for an excuse. We support the Saudi government, because of their oil. Would we risk an economic depression by weakening the Saudi government?
2878 2018-11-21 21:03:16 Sonic and Knuckles are much like oil and water.
2879 2018-11-21 21:03:14 @realdonaldtrump Thanking them for lower oil prices. You are a disgusting little worm.
2880 2018-11-21 21:03:12 Many in Congress are saying @realDonaldTrump is kowtowing to murderous Saudi Arabia... question for all of them ... when exactly has Saudi Arabia NOT been murderous? And have you complained before when filling your car with their oil?
2881 2018-11-21 21:03:10 That is from 2013. USA needs to be oil independent. We can but not w the liberals trying to stop it.
2882 2018-11-21 21:03:01 Excellent article. The root cause is addiction to CHEAP OIL. As soon the US sanctions Saudi Arabia, the Saudis will price their oil in yuan, not the US Dollar, thus leading to the USD losing its value hugely.  Damned if you do, damned if you don't - that's where Trump at...
2883 2018-11-21 21:02:58 I forget how hard I work til I try to take the dirt and oil off my hands
2884 2018-11-21 21:02:52 Grab 'em by the oil pipe.
2885 2018-11-21 21:02:51 In which country? Since u in power ours gone up 12 pence n that's only at cheap garages it's more @Shell shellthats what it's all about your partnership with the Arabs, so u can shaft the world with oil prices
2886 2018-11-21 21:02:50 No problem
2887 2018-11-21 21:02:43 Aren't low oil prices supposed to be reflected in the price at the pump for the consumer Or is is reflected in big oils pocket? @WyattEarpLA @realDonaldTrump @JGilliam_SEAL
2888 2018-11-21 21:02:14 Went to the store for motor oil, left with $30 worth of underwear and some new knitting needles. #adultadd
2889 2018-11-21 21:02:07 So, the price of oil and murder ate OK. Good to@know
2890 2018-11-21 21:02:05 hello??? queen???
2891 2018-11-21 21:01:55 Takes some nerve, when doofus potus is basically excusing a dude’s murder with ‘cheap oil,’ to tout NR’s fiction dept.
2892 2018-11-21 21:01:47 Please educate yourself!  You always have to prove how uninformed you are!  We get very LITTLE oil from Saudi Arabia (9%)!!!  We get 40% from Canada. You know Canada right? It's our alley to the North of the USA. You put  tariffs on them. 
Your such a damn fool!
2893 2018-11-21 21:01:45 I’ve got a great idea for the Canadian oil and gas industry. 

Every company changes its name to Bombardier and move its head office to Montreal. 

Trudeau will be throwing taxpayer money at them. #cdnpoli #ableg
2894 2018-11-21 21:01:39 I’ve started smoking cbd oil to help with my anxiety/depression because I hate taking prescriptions every day of my life to feel some semblance of normal
I also stopped taking my prescriptions sometime last week
so I’ll keep u guys updated on how that goes
2895 2018-11-21 21:01:36 @jerrybrown_Gov
WHAT is happening with the gas prices? The oil price is down and WE see 0 ! WHY are you doing this?
2896 2018-11-21 21:01:33 Permaculture and the planting of trees must be done immediately as solar replaces unnecessary oil. Oh, and kill Monsanto Bayer and Nestle.  #TakeYourSeat
2897 2018-11-21 21:01:31 The largest sources of U.S. imported oil are: Canada (40%), Saudi Arabia (11%), Venezuela (9%), Mexico (8%), and Colombia (4%). According to the American Petroleum Institute. 
11% is not enough to have brutal killers as America's best interest to protect them.
2898 2018-11-21 21:01:29 The Trumped-up confluence of arms sales & oil prices shows that contrary to what #MAGA rubes & #QAnon clodhoppers have been led to believe, Trump is the *real* Deep State's dutiful protector and, not coincidentally, one of the empire's most effective salespersons. #Khashoggi
2899 2018-11-21 21:01:24 There is no end to you stupidity. CHECK where the majority of USA oil imports are from. That's right, the country you slapped with tariffs…. Maybe Canada should think about reverse tarrifs for their water and oil exports to the USA.
2900 2018-11-21 21:01:24 realDonaldTrump U fing lie.  We buy only 10% of r oil from Saudi Arabia.  Also they canl now change their weapon purchases to russia.  They depend on r parts to use their weapons.

2902 2018-11-21 21:01:05 Wind turbines. But yes. Fossil fuels have got to go. Not just to stick it to the Saudi (why are we using their oil? We have oil...)Because we are killing our mother.

2907 2018-11-21 21:01:00 Khashoggi's Killing is an individual case but on barbarian style! Its matter of Saudi Arab not US & you stand right! Half million Syrian killed by Assad & US media & US Senators calm? Cries for individual killing? Good to hear @saudiarabia down oil rate on your pressure!
2908 2018-11-21 21:00:58 Trump lied with Saudi oil import numbers. We get more oil from Canada than the Saudis. Don’t be fooled by trumps fuzzy math.

2914 2018-11-21 21:00:37 I’m gonna research anointing oil
2915 2018-11-21 21:00:36 Saudi Arabia’s ability to manipulate oil prices is my larger concern. Logically, we dont need them at all, but oil is a cartel based market
2916 2018-11-21 21:00:35 Riddled with Palm oil

2919 2018-11-21 21:00:30 Except for your idiot butt kissers, everyone knows we get very little oil from Saudi Arabia... about 9 per cent. You excused murder for less than 10% of our oil imports. #45.. you are a moron!!!@realDonaldTrump @CNN @FoxNews

2923 2018-11-21 21:00:20 Hey, everyone downplaying oil now, Wilkins says it doesn't matter, its share has gone from 30% to 20% so not as important - ok, so the investment here has crashed, and now that it's at lower level it doesn't matter anymore
2924 2018-11-21 21:00:16 But Saudi Arabia create all the terrorists and by being “mates with them for their oil," you are actually sponsoring and encouraging more terrorism, you fascist shill..
2925 2018-11-21 21:00:16 @AliVelshi Why don't you talk about the oil speculators who were anticipating Iran oil sanctions and were caught flat footed when all those waivers were given?  Isn't that why oil rose and then fell? #MSNBC

2927 2018-11-21 21:00:11 You know nothing, Donald J Trumpf: the USA gets more oil from Canada and then we do Saudi Arabia! And you want prices lower than $54/barrel? What happened to America First? Prices that low actually hurt American oil producers.
2928 2018-11-21 21:00:10 @realDonaldTrump congratulations for bringing the oil price down. To think all you had to do was overllook the murder and dismembering of journalist @JKhashoggi. Enjoy your cheap gas brought to you by the blood of an innocent man! Thanks @saudiarabia!
2929 2018-11-21 21:00:09 im so fucking livid!!!!!!!! @walmart oil change got me into 400$ worth of damages all bc they have shit workers that dont fucking do their jobs!!!! FUCK WALMARTTTT
2930 2018-11-21 21:00:03 Yes but gas prices didn't reflect the oil price oddly w Shell and Chevron showing record earnings!!! Hmmmm ....I guess some people are just a lil more upfront... Obama wasn't a millionaire before he took office either now look $485mill wtf?
2931 2018-11-21 21:00:02 I just bought 5 barrels of crude oil and saved a ton . Ya know like most Americans

2934 2018-11-21 20:59:54 Does oil for the right price offer up any of those rubbing the Saudi Arabia Gov . the wrong way???
2935 2018-11-21 20:59:45 Kinda true, if it didn’t look like the economy could go down the tubes from tax cuts and tariffs, oil prices wouldn’t have dropped
2936 2018-11-21 20:59:44 It's so great knowing this movie is getting more attention. The process by itself is a masterpiece but regardless of the fact that it was made completely in oil paintings, it's a very moving film
2937 2018-11-21 20:59:35 Lower the price of your Oil and we’ll let you get away with MURDER ( Trump to the Saudi Arabia rulers) 
2938 2018-11-21 20:59:34 おはようございます。
もう1時間、太朗さんと
お願いします
2939 2018-11-21 20:59:33 You are either stupid or lying again. Saudi Arabia has nothing to do with the lower oil prices. The reason prices are lower is because U.S. production is way up! Saudi Arabia loses money when prices are less than $80 a barrel. What say you
2940 2018-11-21 20:59:32 Sounds great until you realize we get only 10% of our oil from Saudi Arabia.
2941 2018-11-21 20:59:26 Echo show 2nd gen, Phillips hue bulbs, ring 2 doorbell, nest thermostat 3rd gen, nest protect and a future oil heater lol.
2942 2018-11-21 20:59:20 * OUCH * RT @BrunoAmato_1: @realDonaldTrump Oil was at 53$ when Obama left office, and he didn’t need to thank any murderers.
2943 2018-11-21 20:59:18 No Dems the Saudi are American Bitches as we need there money to support businesses and workers! They are stepping up with the oil concerns having sanctioned Iran out of the picture! Dems need to understand world economics
2944 2018-11-21 20:59:17 Canada will buy 80,000 barrels of oil from Saudi Arabia today. Just like it does every day. Does that also count as giving them a pass?
2945 2018-11-21 20:59:06 New supply contracts make it very likely that Saudi Aramco, next year will become China’s largest supplier..
Russia currently accounts for the lion’s share of China’s oil imports, supplying some $23.7 billion worth of crude last year..
2946 2018-11-21 20:59:06 @realDonaldTrump I voted for you and plan to do it again, but if you keep pushing oil prices lower I’ll vote a straight @DNC ticket! @POTUS the country can live off $60/bbl, a large part of your voting base can’t live off $40 or less @FoxNews #oilandgas @kfor @NEWS9 @TomColeOK04
2947 2018-11-21 20:59:03 If they will drop Oil down to $35 then for Global shipping Industry will be good because Fuel cost will drop as well.
2948 2018-11-21 20:59:01 He seems pleased with a lower oil prices, in exchange for the journo.
2949 2018-11-21 20:59:00 It is extraordinarily sad that you think its ok to destroy ecoystems and possibly life on the planet just to get a few more bucks by drilling oil
2950 2018-11-21 20:58:59 The source of the oil is irrelevant. The question is whether Saudi Arabia is powerful enough within OPEC to change the world price.  Hint: I don't think it is.
2951 2018-11-21 20:58:56 .@realDonaldTrump  The United States of America only gets 10% of our oil from Saudi Arabia. Our largest oil trading partner is Canada. You are the dumbest US President in my lifetime, and it's embarrassing.
2952 2018-11-21 20:58:46 @realDonaldTrump gas prices are down because of oil produced in the United States and cause of the 40% we import from Canada. We only import 9% from Saudi Arabia. Get your facts straight before you tweet.
2953 2018-11-21 20:58:45 very true! but they also greatly reduced their vegan products to make room for christmas ones- just irritating how brands are fake ethical to get likes. but i guess it’s better having 1 more ethical option (no palm oil) than not having either
2954 2018-11-21 20:58:40 White phosphorus so they don't damage any oil infrastructure....
2955 2018-11-21 20:58:35 What does the price of crude oil have to do with my daily life?
2956 2018-11-21 20:58:33 40% of US oil comes from Canada .. 11% comes from Saudi Arabia .. lol

2957 2018-11-21 20:58:30 Low oil prices hurt US fracking industry which costs more per barrel to produce than Saudi oil

2961 2018-11-21 20:58:24 Gas prices way down! Thank God the Saudis found all those millions of extra barrels of oil in Khashoggi's body. They had to get it out SOMEHOW!
2962 2018-11-21 20:58:17 Got off work covered in oil a fucked up finger with a bunch of cuts and hurt feelings  what life is this 
2963 2018-11-21 20:58:09 Trump prefers Saudi Oil and Money,over Justice for a US-Resident Journalist Jamal Khashoggi ,who was brutally killed and murdered
2964 2018-11-21 20:58:01 Give it a rest Crapstain. Every president including Obama have slept with the Saudis. They have oil, we have money. We have weapons, they have money. Its a perverted relationship, especially for a country that has human rights violations and still keeps women as basically slaves
2965 2018-11-21 20:57:58 always been that way... He just says it...

2967 2018-11-21 20:57:48 Uh thank you CANADA with being our FIRST place oil importer with 40% and not murdering anyone in any of your consulates. America greatly appreciates it unlike our "president".
2968 2018-11-21 20:57:45 So money they took from Scotland for that purpose stays with England....thieving deceitful bastards!

Wonder how they’ll fund English Pensions without the cushion of Scottish Oil?
2969 2018-11-21 20:57:44 With all due respect, Mr. President Fatass, you appear to know nothing about oil markets in 2018..,or, else, you are lying again.
2970 2018-11-21 20:57:42 But Canada provides 40% of the oil. 
2971 2018-11-21 20:57:42 $65-$80/barrel oil keeps investments coming from privet sector.  Below $65 (ish) discourages exploration and production in the O&G industry.  I'm confused...
2972 2018-11-21 20:57:41 It appears no one told you, we get more than 4x as much oil from #Canada than we do from #SaudiArabia. They need us way more than we need them. #America is the superpower in this equation. Please don’t jeopardize that.
2973 2018-11-21 20:57:40 Moron. Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia. And Canada doesn’t fly planes into American Buildings or export terrorist ideology disguised as religion.
2974 2018-11-21 20:57:35 More B.S. You must really think the American consumer is stupid. We only get 10% of our oil from Saudi Arabia. So tired of your lies.  You just want to make it seem okay that you're protecting your own interests and allowing a murderer to go free. Such an evil man.
2975 2018-11-21 20:57:33 Only 9% of our oil comes from Saudi Arabia. 40% from Canada. But you rebuke our neighbors to the north and coddle the murderers of a US citizen.
2976 2018-11-21 20:57:31 Canada supplies America with more than four times the oil that Saudi Arabia does.  Too bad we're such a security threat.
2977 2018-11-21 20:57:28 Dirty money. Our president turns his head at a horrible crime to a journalist for cheaper oil.
2978 2018-11-21 20:57:26 Not have oil.
2979 2018-11-21 20:57:23 created jobs what about all the jobs you liberals drove out of the country your the cause of the auto sector leaving and your working on driving the oil sector out if taxes are lower for the middle class why are my taxes and cost of living going up? face it you failed
2980 2018-11-21 20:57:22 I live in Canada. He hates us. Our taxes are high, as we have 'socialized' Universal Healthcare. 
True fact: The United States counts our oil supplies and potential supply as their own 'oil reserves' supply.
2981 2018-11-21 20:57:19 Get coconut oil and they won’t even care about the boyfriend
2982 2018-11-21 20:57:16 Then she talked about energy and resources.. Imagine if Russia were to take over Alaska again... There is so much oil and natural gas, it is a matter of GREAT national security and our proximity TO Russia is very important.
2983 2018-11-21 20:57:11 @realDonaldTrump you r thanking SAUDI'S for oil prices! We only get 9% of r oil from then. 40% from ur enemy Canada. U r dumb as dirt. FU
2984 2018-11-21 20:57:09 A man was murdered, but oil is cheap! Yay republicans!
2985 2018-11-21 20:57:07 Yup and now because of that glut, SA is decreasing oil barrels to the US and will most likely increase prices, just like they did last time
2986 2018-11-21 20:57:06 I suspect were waiting on the neocons to give up on global hegemony at this point. As well as US defense firms and oil super majors too eek out as much profit as they can before the fleets come home.
2987 2018-11-21 20:57:06 Be ready that they can surprise all of us with Oil prices by Monday. I don't like how they are pushing Oil down by Global propagandists. Some of them are scaring that Oil can drop down to $35 which is impossible from my Analysis.
2988 2018-11-21 20:57:06 You do know that 40% of our oil comes from Canada right? Only 9% from Saudi Arabi....good thing you are so nice to Canada 
2989 2018-11-21 20:57:01 The good news is that pro climate action dollars went a lot further than pro oil industry dollars in the 2018 election. It's an asymmetric battle and carbon intensive industries are on the defensive
2990 2018-11-21 20:57:01 Only 9% of our oil comes from Saudi Arabia. 40% comes from Canada and you always are nasty to the Prime Minister.
2991 2018-11-21 20:56:58 I don’t be knowing if my oil gets me high or if it’s just my weed lol
2992 2018-11-21 20:56:57 We only get 9% of our oil from them. We get 40% from Canada. Time for trump to grow up.
2993 2018-11-21 20:56:56 Thanks America for the low oil prices, not Saudi Arabia. We only get 9% from Saudi Arabia.
2994 2018-11-21 20:56:53 Wow, that is disappointing and needs addressing. Would happily pay a bit more for their products if they replaced palm oil with a better alternative.
2995 2018-11-21 20:56:45 Trump Translator: I’ve got a whole list of reporters from fake news I could let you guys have at! Just gimme cheap oil!
2996 2018-11-21 20:56:44 Paying up the ass for oil is definitely not America First
2997 2018-11-21 20:56:44 Unfortunately, White supremacy succeeded in altering the pride of our ancestry by replacing Blackness with Whiteness and making the colonizers tongue the official language that would help with oil exportation. It’s a disease with consequences and the cure will take a miracle.
2998 2018-11-21 20:56:35 Coconut oil?
2999 2018-11-21 20:56:31 Donald Trump has just tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to 'a big Tax Cut for America and the World!' In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.Lying Lying Lying
3000 2018-11-21 20:56:31 @realDonaldTrump 40% of oil comes from Canada only 9% comes from #SaudiArabia #FactsMatter
3001 2018-11-21 20:56:31 Why do oil changes cost $100? 
3002 2018-11-21 20:56:31 BTW, 10% of our oil comes from the Middle East/Saudi Arabia. 40% comes from Canada, a country you managed to piss off. And which country is the greatest EXPORTER of oil?  Well, look at that.  It’s the U.S.
3003 2018-11-21 20:56:30 day 1 back to work: splashed fryer oil in my face 
can i go back to fight riffs now?
3004 2018-11-21 20:56:29 Ali Velshi, nice presentation just now about oil pricing.   Just showing the blimp boy again has no idea what he is talking about.

3008 2018-11-21 20:56:17 Most oil doesn’t come from Saudi Arabia these days Moron potus
3009 2018-11-21 20:56:16 Thank you @Canada for low gas prices here in the U.S.

You supply us 40% of our oil so it's pretty clear you deserve nearly 4 times the praise from us that we are giving Saudi Arabia (who supplies 11%).

#KhashoggiMurder #Khashoggi
3010 2018-11-21 20:56:16 All taxes get passed onto the end user though. At least if you tax end user directly you _can_ also exclude vulnerable end users directly. Otherwise you privatise who decides which user gets hurt the most as oil/gas (etc) company make their pricing decisions based on profit.
3011 2018-11-21 20:56:15 My oil change 70$ smh
3012 2018-11-21 20:56:14 Yes you are right and Modi also is bringing down the crude oil prices to suit the election, pls save your seats in Kerala ....
3013 2018-11-21 20:56:12 Also funding for journalists who tell the story of climate brittleness and oil/gas trickery. Many people don't know how much climate change will impact them personally and few people accept all the trickery the oil/gas industry is up to.
3014 2018-11-21 20:56:07 That's funny....Canada supplies 40% of the imported oil to the US and the Saudis are only at 11%
3015 2018-11-21 20:56:05 Donald Trump is more crude than Saudi Arabia’s oil.
3016 2018-11-21 20:56:04 Make marijuana legal,  make CBD oil legal. Instead those of us with horrible chronic pain must continue to take pain pills.
3017 2018-11-21 20:55:57 Only 9% of oil comes from Saudi Arabia. Your tweet is a lie.
3018 2018-11-21 20:55:51 Really?  Do you really think its thats simple?  You do realize Saudi Arabia is our main supplier of oil?  What happened to Khashoggi was a tragedy, but the needs of a country come before the needs of one.  Youre naive to think we can have it both ways.
3019 2018-11-21 20:55:48 We only get 9% of our oil from Saudi Arabia. Another lie!!!!!
3020 2018-11-21 20:55:45 Did Donald actually trade Khashoggi info and intel for a drop in oil prices ?
3021 2018-11-21 20:55:38 By the way: oil smuggling benefits Libyan criminals. Supporting the human smuggling benefits Libyan criminals, and as result kills a lot of people at sea. The NGOs will not become less complicit by crying "hold the oil thief"...
3022 2018-11-21 20:55:37 Idiot, do you really think that's why oil prices are low.  U.S. gets less than 15% of oil from Saudis Aribia.
3023 2018-11-21 20:55:25 That's the real America. If you believe otherwise, you're ignorant (and don't want to learn) and/or you lack integrity. #CannotSaveYou! Murdering for oil, warring to help MIC, pro-gun over pro-life, bloodshed over life, money over humanity. War over healthcare and more. #Facts!!!
3024 2018-11-21 20:55:23 It would be nice if leftists were as outraged by the murder of the guy that exposed the corruption in the democrat party instead of a Saudi "journalist" who was working on the side of the Iranians to bring an oil pipeline across Turkey so that Russia could sell oil to our enemy.
3025 2018-11-21 20:55:23 @rickcatino Don’t kid yourself. You’re paying 63 cents a gallon more today from Trump’s inauguration. The US produces more oil than Saudi. The profits from these increases go to corporations at the expense of the public. This another case of Donald’s smoke and mirrors
3026 2018-11-21 20:55:23 i guess price for oil is a good trade for murder in your mind.
3027 2018-11-21 20:55:19 We get 11 percent of our oil from Saudi.   Someone should tell you that.
3028 2018-11-21 20:55:15 Ayy, the prez of The States is an ally to one of the most horrible regimes on earth. All for oil! Famine and starving kids in Yemen must be worth it to him and his flock.
3029 2018-11-21 20:55:11 I fully admit that the blame doesn’t land entirely at the feet of Trudeau and the Liberals. The system has been dysfunctional for longer than they’ve been in power. 

However, compare and contrast Liberal support to Bombardier with their interaction with Canadian oil and gas.
3030 2018-11-21 20:55:11 Donald Trump has just tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to 'a big Tax Cut for America and the World!' In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.Lying Lying Lying

3032 2018-11-21 20:55:03 Yah, let’s use as much as we can, who really cares about climate change, wildlife, or let’s face it, the next generation. We don’t even know the next generation, maybe we wouldn’t like them anyway. Let’s just burn that oil while we can and watch everything struggle and parish.
3033 2018-11-21 20:54:58 I thought we had so much oil we didn't need Saudi Arabia.  If we harness solar, wind, tide, recycled methane, we won't need ANY oil from them, and then where will the Prince MSB be? Maybe in jail for murder?
3034 2018-11-21 20:54:55 Oil with oxygen would most likely be flammable.
The molecules in oil are usually carbon chains with hydrogen.
This is similar to for example fuel.

Usually, they don't burn, as they don't have any oxygen molecules.
For example, petrol (car fuel) or kerosine (jet fuel) don't burn.

3036 2018-11-21 20:54:53 So you can get our Canadian oil for less than the already $14 per barrel ithat it is today? Then resell it... despicable.
3037 2018-11-21 20:54:51 Just money to you. Freedom of the press vastly  transcends low oil prices. And what about that #stockmarket downturn?
3038 2018-11-21 20:54:51 Actually low oil prices are indicative of a slowing economy. Don the con is an idiot.
3039 2018-11-21 20:54:49 7% of Americas' oil comes from Saudi Arabia; 40% from Canada
3040 2018-11-21 20:54:48 @realDonaldTrump thank saudi!! you get most of your oil from Canada you dimwit!!
3041 2018-11-21 20:54:33 I think there are people that had no idea who he was and bought the snake oil. I think that kind of thing happens all the time. It doesn’t make it right or smart...but I think it’s human. And brave of Ojeda to be saying he did vote for DT and now opposes him.
3042 2018-11-21 20:54:24 Doesn't Canada provide more oil to us than Saudi Arabia?
3043 2018-11-21 20:54:24 Unbelievable, that you should sacrifice @JKhashoggi and Yemenis for lower oil prices.  As if Saudi Arabia were powerful enough to change the world price (it no longer is).
3044 2018-11-21 20:54:19 Y do you act surprised? There’s nothing in history that says oil hasn’t always been paid in blood. This time, Trump isn’t pretending about it.
3045 2018-11-21 20:54:19 Yes there will and yes they did. Maybe he should have kept the oil guy around. Even thought Tillerson said he was a tucking moron
3046 2018-11-21 20:54:18 The Arabs own 90% of London, #FACT 
And we has a country wouldn’t work without them. Neither would yours it’s all oil and money 
3047 2018-11-21 20:54:17 How does the 1 million bbls/day of imported oil come into Canada?   Just things that make fact checkers go hmmm.
3048 2018-11-21 20:54:16 The oil price is determined by the supply and demand regardless how much we import from Canada. Go back to college and take economics 101.
3049 2018-11-21 20:54:13 Deep fry it in peanut oil and get back to me.
3050 2018-11-21 20:54:07 Me too. God forbid someone discovers oil or some other valuable resource is growing there, then you know it’ll be all over as soon as other countries (including the US) can get over there
3051 2018-11-21 20:54:04 The NZD to USD $ is up 6.5% from recent lows & Crude Oil is down a whopping 30% from recent highs, but the price of petrol at the pump has only dropped 11% (would have been 12% without 3.5cent tax added).

Come on NZ petrol companies pass on the SAVINGS

3052 2018-11-21 20:54:02 If someone pointing a gun to your head gets their gun taken away, you're safer, no?

If KSA prices oil in CNY, it will help DJT's goal of MAGA, which ultimately requires a much weaker USD.  IMO, non-DJT Wash DC establishment's tone is def one of "KSA just priced some oil in CNY."
3053 2018-11-21 20:53:57 It has nothing to do with the cost of gas, or the price of a barrel of oil.  It’s about @realDonaldTrump personal agreement with a murderous dictator.  MAGAs welcome to believe otherwise, it’ll come out eventually.
3054 2018-11-21 20:53:56 That’s not how it works.  Thank the current oil surplus, not your so called wheeling and dealing
3055 2018-11-21 20:53:54 Are the lower oil prices KSAs attempt at blood money? 
3056 2018-11-21 20:53:51 Good point, and a stiff tariff on imported oil as a national security measure would make sense (as does the tariff on imported steel).  However, Americans have been complaining about the side effects of fracking - in particular toxic fracking fluids used.
3057 2018-11-21 20:53:46 Saudi depressed oil prices in an attempt to push US shale producers out of business...
3058 2018-11-21 20:53:44 @Steve_Dangle ever notice that Peter Chiarelli looks like David Cross? Also since he's hanging on by a thread in Oil Town,  Dubas could fleece him with a Nylander trade?

3064 2018-11-21 20:53:21 9% of our oil comes from Saudi Arabia, 40% comes from Canada.  Your stance on defending the Saudi Prince for the murder of a distinguished journalist is despicable.  You're America First stance is bullshit, you care about Trump first.  You, have no Soul.  WORST PRESIDENT EVER!

3068 2018-11-21 20:53:07 @lisamurkowski how you feeling about Trump sanctioning the murder of a journalist so oil price will stay low?
3069 2018-11-21 20:53:05 In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.  Look it up!
3070 2018-11-21 20:53:04 This weather is hurting my nipples. They need constant rubbing with warm oil.
3071 2018-11-21 20:52:59 FWIW, I’m in favour of a Carbon Tax. I’d aim at industry, agriculture and oil and gas at every opportunity. Only then at the individual and I’d put a floor on a household to avoid fuel poverty and I’d get actual environmentalists in to the ministry.
3072 2018-11-21 20:52:54 Thank you Canada for selling oil to the US for $17 per barrel. Yup, $17.  Trump says Canada takes advantage of the US. You be the judge.
3073 2018-11-21 20:52:52 @RepKinzinger
Trump celebrates low oil prices, tweeting "Thank you to Saudi Arabia"

3075 2018-11-21 20:52:22 Crazy as it sounds but you Americans buy more oil from  than you do from Saudi!! And I cannot think of when we last murdered any of your journalists ... or any Americans!!! Geez ...
3076 2018-11-21 20:52:20 Add a few drops of essential oil to your clay mask, won’t help you sleep but... 
3077 2018-11-21 20:52:18 So I have the oil from Holland and Barrett, but once that is gone my brother uses a spray from Pure Life, so I'm going to be ordering some from them. Its BOGOF with them at the moment too and they have different strengths :)
3078 2018-11-21 20:52:17 The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia also owns America’s largest oil refinery in America, which is located in Houston, Texas. And I can tell you that almost nothing leaves the state of Texas without being taxed so, there’s that revenue. I could go on...
3079 2018-11-21 20:52:15 Shit, boy, change your oil.
3080 2018-11-21 20:52:13 Oh boy haha well start with washing your face every night! I’ve started oil cleansing and I love it especially given the winter

Doctored the recipe a bit.
Used sesame oil instead of oo and added a little worcestershire sauce.

3084 2018-11-21 20:51:59 The USA is now the worlds #1 oil producer...why does the President want the price of oil to go down???
3085 2018-11-21 20:51:59 It's an Argentinan condiment. Chimichurri is made of finely chopped parsley, minced garlic, olive oil, oregano, and red wine vinegar. The dominant flavors are parsley and garlic. Its great on meat, poultry, fish, and IMHO on plantains.

you shut up and #MBS fill your pocket with oil money.
3087 2018-11-21 20:51:55 Apparently not enough of an atrocity because you & Trump just sold us for the price of oil. Way to show how much you value our troops still in uniform & all those who served, sacrificed, and died...the price of oil!!!

3098 2018-11-21 20:51:16 Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, only 11% comes from Saudi Arabia. SA has sought to boost oil prices by promising to pump fewer barrels in Dec. & a week ago, it backed a proposal for OPEC nations to cut production by one million barrels per day. #Facts

3100 2018-11-21 20:51:10 Not if we can quit importing oil and use our own...plenty under the USA to fill our needs and need to crank up the #RFS to higher ethanol blends to help farmers as well
3101 2018-11-21 20:51:08 @realDonaldTrump so far I succeeded, and from now on depends on your decision on the full boycott of oil, if you want to free our people to finish the Iranian oil, there is no other way does not have
3102 2018-11-21 20:51:07 My sister was complaining about another one of her debilitating migraines. She took all the drugs and no relief.

Migraine gone.
You may all refer to me as Dr. Extraordinaire henceforth.
3103 2018-11-21 20:51:03 No one said to jump in a lake. They have no option other than to sell oil. One trick pony. I get the point but admonishing them and forcing change would not make them hare Iran less or want our help less in my view.
3104 2018-11-21 20:51:03 Clueless to who and how oil prices are set.

3107 2018-11-21 20:50:47 Andrew thanks for clarifying, I've used the app to check a few products out. RSPO is stated on some product labels where the app identifies Palm Oil as a possible content.

3114 2018-11-21 20:50:31 Doesn’t look too bad at all! Looks like maybe a bit less oil needed - you can move it round the pan with your fingers to stop it sticking. Satisfying though, right?
3115 2018-11-21 20:50:19 Which oil is better
3116 2018-11-21 20:50:15 Yes, but Saudis lowered oil prices asked by Trump, so that makes it ok.
3117 2018-11-21 20:50:09 Stupid old hag thinks oil is only used for cars

3121 2018-11-21 20:49:57 Mr Trump's latest comments praising the Saudis for the reduction in the oil price is probably the signal that he has moved on from the  Khashoggi murder.

3128 2018-11-21 20:49:38 Yes! and how about the States going for #RenewableEnergy and ending the toxic relationship with both oil and Saudi Arabia?
3129 2018-11-21 20:49:29 Not impressed with oil or $SPY today. WTI closing back under that Oct 13 low is important. $XOP showed some relative strength, but still looks like it is going to close under that important 33.85-34.00 area. $SPY going out at the low of day. Friday half day could be volatile.
3130 2018-11-21 20:49:29 Oh yes. And Trump doesn’t want to lose an ally to Russia and China. You know, how dishes out sensitive information to the public without any guilt is amazing. Clearly defending the Saudis because of Russia and China, Arms & Oil prices. ‘making US great again’ he says afterwards.

3139 2018-11-21 20:49:02 He’s lucky. In Saudi Arabia you get murdered, live on tape (as it were) and then the supposed leader of the free world absolves them from blame and praises lower oil prices instead

3151 2018-11-21 20:48:15 I remember when they had to stop putting lead in gas and they raised the price across the board for not putting lead in, which saved them money and made oil barons fortunes.

3156 2018-11-21 20:47:58 Biggest oil Producer in World;
This year it's USA:

Not MidEast or Russia!
3157 2018-11-21 20:47:52 Sanctioning oil sales, and I would like the UN to hold MSB accountable, isn’t there a way to prosecute international crimes?
3158 2018-11-21 20:47:50 어휴 스토리 짜는데 자꾸 도자기 깨기 해서 한참 헤맸네..근데 헤맨 만큼 괜찮은게 나와서 만족..
3159 2018-11-21 20:47:43 Two questions:-
Do they have oil?
Do they buy weapons from U.K. companies?
If yes, then U.K. will speak outrage and carry on as before.
3160 2018-11-21 20:47:40 Personally, the ad should not be shown on tv as it could be misleading. They still have own brand items for sale which contain palm oil including certain Christmas products.
3161 2018-11-21 20:47:37 Disgusted Australian here.' #Cutmeupwithabonesaw If I am wrong . I am in shock to hear tRump say he will not punish the Saudi prince, if he lowers oil prices. A gift to the American people. Making America not look great. guess who's funding tRumps 2020
3162 2018-11-21 20:47:35 Thank Canada we 40% of our oil from them only 14% from Saudi.

You can Thank Saudi for 911

Lastly your tax cut is a joke like you beinf POTUS!!!!
3163 2018-11-21 20:47:34 I cook well. Let’s not doubt that. But my skill of dumping the chopped onions from 2 feet away the stove, into the crackling oil is exemplary. #madskillz
3164 2018-11-21 20:47:34 The motor oil tho 
3165 2018-11-21 20:47:31 my sis is 2000 miles over due on her oil change and we’re otw to the beach y’all think we gonna blow up?
3166 2018-11-21 20:47:26 You Yanks are closer to Arabs more than the average American knows. You’re government spills loads of shit to the people how we hate them. Yet they’ll fly a complete military artillery in to protect them all in the name of oil . #FACT
3167 2018-11-21 20:47:22 Happy about disemboweling the U.S. oil industry?
3168 2018-11-21 20:47:18 White men are the kings of playing the victim while hiding behind their privilege. I'm sure if anyone tries to take your CBD oil away you'll be crying about "government interference" and "individual rights" and blah blah blah. Sit down.
3169 2018-11-21 20:47:17 @realDonaldTrump is the beast deal maker! Kill a journalist and get cheaper oil! #lockhimup
3170 2018-11-21 20:47:14 We get 11% of our oil from your murderous friends and 40% from Canada. We have seen how you treat Canada vs Saudi's.
3171 2018-11-21 20:47:12 Is there some offshore floating oil production facility on the west coast that I hadn’t heard about? Apple and oranges
3172 2018-11-21 20:47:08 Cravings are rough and have a meaning behind them. When they hit, take a moment to check in and see what’s going on. Do what you can to fix the issue, then oil up and move on. #essentialoils #oilup #momlife #mompreneur
3173 2018-11-21 20:47:03 I am glad to see oil prices dropping.  Why is it that you never take credit when the prices go up?  By the way, oil prices were at $43 in 2016 when you took office.  Is that what you call fake news?
3174 2018-11-21 20:47:00 We already have "clean coal."  I now pronounce this "clean oil."  See how easy that was?
3175 2018-11-21 20:46:56 Indeed, a surge in cheap oil at this juncture is not what the doctor ordered.
3176 2018-11-21 20:46:52 It is what it is. I’m sure you prefer cheap oil over a butchered human just like Donnie does.
3177 2018-11-21 20:46:51 Agreed. Turkey and chicken need spices and condiments to get flavour. If a meat is tasty it only needs a drizzle of olive oil and you just throw it in the pan.
3178 2018-11-21 20:46:45 Rapeseed oil is poison.
3179 2018-11-21 20:46:44 The North Sea contains both fish and oil. But the BBC only ever seem to want to talk about one of these. 
3180 2018-11-21 20:46:44 If you can give APC 16 years and nothing to shoe for that I would agree that they are worse, when comparing also take other factors (global inflation, oil price drop and other things ) into consideration.... Now I would stand by my words PDP is the worst thing that happened to us
3181 2018-11-21 20:46:41 I thought they lowered prices because there was going to be a glut on the market and they didn't want the prices of oil till go way down
3182 2018-11-21 20:46:40 What we mean: we want certain weapons made harder to obtain to limit the damage possible when people act on impulse or rage. What some gun owners hear: we want to take everybody's guns away. Red herrings like LAGO and laws-don't-prevent-crimes just make you look irrational.
3183 2018-11-21 20:46:38 Bad gravy is the consistency of water.
Good gravy starts with the consistency of used 10w-30 motor oil. Facts.
3184 2018-11-21 20:46:35 Ooof, don't s(p)oil yourself now

3187 2018-11-21 20:46:29 *They plan for Iran was to build an oil pipeline from Iran's oil fields to Israel (Port of Haifa) in the Trans-Iran-Israel pipeline.
3188 2018-11-21 20:46:29 Dude, oil prices are going down because demand drops in winter, and because the economy is softening. Instead of celebrating, you should be working with your economic advisors to plan for the next recession.
3189 2018-11-21 20:46:28 Which is a lie  Theirs a surplus of oil on the market right now
3190 2018-11-21 20:46:28 While I think what they’re doing re: Palm Oil is great, and more shops need to follow suit, I think folk complaining about them not stocking their widely popular vegan range over Christmas are well within their rights to do so.
3191 2018-11-21 20:46:26 In order for 3/4 of the worlds population to have even a little better of a life the world needs 100,000,000 bbl of oil a day just to live in the standard of Mexico. In order for Canada to continue with its way of life Our quality of life requires the highest energy of any of G20

Nobody is gonna think of how to get the oil money coming, everybody will be down his state and region working to survive and grow.
3194 2018-11-21 20:46:18 The issue is not oil prices, but rather stability and support for an ally in the Mideast a check on Iran becoming the areas sole hegemon. It is unfortunate Khashoggi was killed however you can not sacrifice the balance of power for millions of people for one individual.

3197 2018-11-21 20:46:06 But hey, they dropped the price of oil, so we'll forgive the finest minds of the 11th century any atrocity they care to commit.
3198 2018-11-21 20:45:52 Stopped of in Dubai on the way to Australia.Everything the country has been bulit with oil money .Big hotels and shopping Malls. Next time with stopped off stoped in Singapore a country rich with heritage

3200 2018-11-21 20:45:48 All about oil. Even more clear why we rushed head first into Iraq.

3204 2018-11-21 20:45:28 No I have personal investments I do well with them I’m an engineer by profession I work in the oil industry. I could retire but I love my work and I like to solve problems and the challenges of my career.
3205 2018-11-21 20:45:20 Also, Saudi Arabia has sought to boost oil prices by promising to pump fewer barrels in December. A week ago, it backed a proposal for OPEC nations to cut production by one million barrels per day.  ~CBC News Alerts.

3208 2018-11-21 20:45:06 Clare where does the fertiliser (muck) come from which helps our soil biology grow oats? What makes our land so green and pleasant? Just how much rainforest is felled for soya or palm oil? When we can utilise our own land so much more efficiently. How much oats to 1l oat juice?
3209 2018-11-21 20:45:06 Canadian oil is extremely important to America, please help keep it flowing Let’s work to build better pipelines
3210 2018-11-21 20:45:04 Trump is not only ignorant of America's oil sources, he hasn't done a damn thing to increase domestic production. Pu**y!
3211 2018-11-21 20:45:03 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
3212 2018-11-21 20:45:01 Trump just cant stop lying .fact check him today about saudia is a big help to america from oil guns and jobs.but in fact trump want those ties for his personal business ties claiming its america intrest.i hope his base see that trump is a traitor against his own country.
3213 2018-11-21 20:44:58 I could leave the seaweed, but that fish oil is a good edition for sure.

Oh, and yeah. @mlp__smolder is teaching me how to cook pies too. Apparently that's a big thing for this Neighborly Day event?
3214 2018-11-21 20:44:56 Was that the deal you worked out Trump? Let Saudi Prince kill a journalist, and they will cut oil $! You really need mental health help NOW!

3216 2018-11-21 20:44:54 Hey Tulsi, @realDonaldTrump is doing the right thing for America... Read about the Saudi's cutting off their oil back in the 1970's... How'd you like to explain $18 a gallon gas and waiting lines to your folks in Hawaii??
3217 2018-11-21 20:44:43 80 beans for an oil change lol bitch why???

U.S: Can we get some cheaper oil?

3221 2018-11-21 20:44:31 Please explain how our country when from big importer of oil to being a large exporter of oil which mean our oil companies are bring big bucks but as far as creating jobs in that area a negative impact. Also many jobs which use to be in that area have disappeared explain why.
3222 2018-11-21 20:44:30 Why are we depending on oil from those murderers, can't we produce oil in our country, or is it that you have real estate interests in that country.  You said in 2015 they Saudis gave you lots of money, pouring in.
3223 2018-11-21 20:44:28 If data is the new oil for a new industrial revolution, people should check out what we've done to humanity with the existing oil. A few got richer, while the externalities hurt us all dearly. Maybe data miners should leave it in the ground...

3226 2018-11-21 20:44:23 May be MbS was getting too popular with the rest of the world's leaders & particularly Russia. May be he had got tied of being controlled by the US who only seemed to want oil & weapons sales & may be had got fed up with Yemen war undertaken on behalf of US.

3229 2018-11-21 20:44:22 @politicsfisher They exhibit moral outrage when a Saudi journalist is murdered yet continue to allow tankers up the St. Lawrence filled with Saudi oil! Oil that could be supplied from Western Canada! Are you getting the picture.
3230 2018-11-21 20:44:14 와 쉐릴이 미성년자여?
3231 2018-11-21 20:44:12 Exactly it's not about the USA and oil it's about his financial gains
3232 2018-11-21 20:44:08 Essential Oil Diffuser

- This may seem weird but it helps with controlling oil and dryness. You can also put beneficial essential oils in it to help balance your skin and health. You skin won’t be too oily or dry if you have it on constantly!!!
3233 2018-11-21 20:44:07 yes and natural gas moves so fast up..  so theres a bigger trade there unwinding between inst Longs $OIL and Short Gas according to the people who sit on tv and get to spread the rumors
3234 2018-11-21 20:44:07 Just remembered I have to get an oil change today. Now I have to leave my house 
3235 2018-11-21 20:44:06 @tdichristopher Read you stop about machinations around oil. I bought an electric car. I don't care. That feels SO good, it's worth the extra money up front and having to chargr the car from time to time. I'm driving electric for world peace. :-)
3236 2018-11-21 20:43:50 4

Jewish state, Palestinian state were supposed to be created after World War 1

Iran was a friend of USA and most important asset after its people - oil

Truman discussed importance of coal while President

USA nationalized many industries during World War 1, World War 2
3237 2018-11-21 20:43:49 So you’re trading human rights for lower oil prices? What a shame.
3238 2018-11-21 20:43:48 Ha! Who didn’t know you guys were our largest oil supplier?!?!? Moron.
3239 2018-11-21 20:43:47 “Oil prices low. Like a tax cut for America” 

No. 

Saudi Arabia doesn’t set the oil prices, it’s a world thing. They have no effect. 

Also, not like a tax cut. You know what’s like a tax cut? 

A tax cut. 

Is this Nickelodeon presidency over yet? #KhashoggiMurder
3240 2018-11-21 20:43:42 Palm oil is bloody everywhere 
3241 2018-11-21 20:43:38 40% US oil comes from Canada and only 11% from Saudi Arabia. But that doesn’t fit tRump’s narrative so he conveniently ignores this fact.
3242 2018-11-21 20:43:24 And 40% of your imported oil comes from Canada. Only 11% come from the murderous Saudi's
3243 2018-11-21 20:43:22 40% of your oil comes from Canada. 11% from SA... this is not about oil prices or jobs... this is about lining Trumps creepy pockets and his skeezy son-in-law ...
3244 2018-11-21 20:43:16 It's worse than you think...

If what my SA friends are telling me is true, it's not about Trump business dealings or oil prices, but blackmail and the crown of SA.
3245 2018-11-21 20:43:14 Canada supplies 40% of your oil, SA about 10%!! Who should you be thanking you orange fathead?
3246 2018-11-21 20:43:10 Algal oil provides fish free pollutant free EPA and DHA (long chain omega 3’s) for less than 20cents a day without contributing to the 46% of plastic in the ocean deposited by fishing industries. Fish is purely unessential for health.

3249 2018-11-21 20:43:05 It seems like whatever he does will never be approved by your hatred for Trump!  Trump wants oil drilled outside of our country and the liberals don’t want to screw up our environment.  Why don’t you post how you would take care of this problem.  We all, we all waiting.
3250 2018-11-21 20:43:02 And we get 40% of our oil from Canada, around 11% from Saudi. He is a traitor
3251 2018-11-21 20:43:01 What America? You sold us for the price of oil!!!
3252 2018-11-21 20:42:58 Donald Trump has just tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to 'a big Tax Cut for America and the World!' In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
3253 2018-11-21 20:42:55 So I save 2 cents a gallon thanks to murdering Saudi oil. But I pay 5 cents extra for a can of soup because of steel tariffs. How is this an economic boom?
3254 2018-11-21 20:42:40 Mr. Killa - Oil It 
3255 2018-11-21 20:42:40 I need a joint venture capitalist. Put your money behind me. I wanna give people clean highs. Healthy plants with the right pesticides. Hybrids that make sense. Thc oils extracted and combined with coconut oil. THAT is edible.
3256 2018-11-21 20:42:39 Anyone got some healthy vegan recipes? I've defaulted to mashed potatoes or chips with barely any oil most days and I need some more variety.
3257 2018-11-21 20:42:39 This "blind eye" has to do with weapons, geo politics and the petro dollar... MBS can kill the USA in a heart beat by stopping oil trade in dollars and threatened to do so if he was implicated. So, WHY does the CIA put Trump in this position after MBS issued his threats?
3258 2018-11-21 20:42:35 The US gets about 13% of our oil from Saudi Arabia.  I highly doubt 13% makes much of a difference to our gas prices.
3259 2018-11-21 20:42:34 I’m curious what is your point here? I sense you're a “green” advocate yet you are fomenting the economic loss of oil revenue?
You don’t factor OPEC or US impact flooding oil markets, lowering all oil prices?
3260 2018-11-21 20:42:32 have to see how $OPEC goes on Dec 06  and how much lower the canadain stocks go because of tax loss,   but im seeing bargin prices compared to oil companys in the states
3261 2018-11-21 20:42:30 Depends on the product. A few things wouldn't be quite the same without it but a vast amount don't really need it. It's also difficult to spot things that have palm oil derivatives in as they're not listed as palm oil and the majority of derivatives aren't sustainable.
3262 2018-11-21 20:42:29 We get 11% of our oil from SA.  11%.  Our own production and that in Canada could make up the difference and we wouldn't have to sell the American soul to get small cuts in cost.
3263 2018-11-21 20:42:28 has anyone used cbd oil successfully its so gross to me
3264 2018-11-21 20:42:27 It don’t matter. It’s not an issue at all
3265 2018-11-21 20:42:24 No, thank you to the AMERICAN oil producers!
3266 2018-11-21 20:42:24 Most of America's oil comes from Canada.
3267 2018-11-21 20:42:21 Trump has Congress the last 2 years. Can't blame Dems. What happened to the shale oil in N Dakota? Saudis dropped the oil prices and massive layoffs. They are not out from. They fund terrorism.
3268 2018-11-21 20:42:16 Canda is the main exporter of oil to the U S, double the amount that the Saudis export. He treats Canada like sh...t and kisses the Saudis a.....es. Meanwhile they are spending millions at his hotels. Filling his pockets!
3269 2018-11-21 20:42:06 Being able to print fiat and purchase oil.
3270 2018-11-21 20:42:05 My thoughts, too. I thought we were trying to stop being dependent on the Middle East. Here he’s openly saying we’re so desperate we’ll excuse anything they do, as long as they keep producing oil.
3271 2018-11-21 20:41:56 We don’t more oil from Canada or Saudi Arabia. We could be self sufficient if we wanted to be. We could halt banking with the Saudi government if we chose but what real impact would that have?

3275 2018-11-21 20:41:49 @NutellaGlobal do you have a plan to change your palm oil use to sustainable palm oil or none?
3276 2018-11-21 20:41:48 @AldiUK can you advise on the palm oil policy,  Aldi states all food products RSPO.why not Nutoka?
3277 2018-11-21 20:41:48 Oil futures are more important than domestic oil usage
3278 2018-11-21 20:41:47 Dictator, may be, but ass leaker that's for sure. And he leaks islamic ass, the ultimate sacrifice to have the cheap damn oil.
3279 2018-11-21 20:41:40 10 years of Harper and not one pipeline to tidewater. Harper was content on keeping Canada dependent upon the US: he tried to merge our militaries, have a more integrated economy; his legacy continues as Scheer tries to Republicanize Canada. Ethical oil is an oxymoron.
3280 2018-11-21 20:41:39 And prices are lower due to the economy slowinh down and that the US now produces...MORE OIL THAN THE SAUDI'S!

3282 2018-11-21 20:41:35 If oil from Alberta were used in Canada ? You canot blame Feds for bad planning by Alberta Oilsands Industry. Producing without knowing how to get product to customer > then blaming « others » for obstacles

Oh /yeah!/ EVERYTHING would be so much better if it had fish oil and seaweed in it! Like... cupcakes! Fries! /Salad!/
3284 2018-11-21 20:41:32 When BMW charging me $100 for an oil change on my car but my Ex workplace (Honda) has the hook up for $30 
3285 2018-11-21 20:41:29 What America? You sold us for the price of oil!
3286 2018-11-21 20:41:27 Feeling and sounding exactly like your local high school stoner bro at my grandparents convincing them to try CBD oil but I won’t leave this house without dropping some under their little tongues!
3287 2018-11-21 20:41:27 Is this a joke ? gas is more expensive than last year and ask anyone who works in oil trump is a major fuck up
3288 2018-11-21 20:41:26 Disgusted Australian here.' #Cutmeupwithabonesaw If I am wrong . I am in shock to hear tRump say he will not punish the Saudi prince, if he lowers oil prices. A gift to the American people. Making America not look great. guess who's funding tRumps 2020   
3289 2018-11-21 20:41:18 We didn't hear too much from you when they were going up. As much as I like cheap gas, low oil prices hurt US oil producers...or didn't you know that?
#FuckingMoron
3290 2018-11-21 20:41:06 And still pay $2.49 in NW Oklahoma. I too am concerned about the drop in oil.
3291 2018-11-21 20:41:00 Can you divulge what brand of krill oil you use? I am always skeptical of where the supplements are sourced, and that having an impact on their effectiveness. Thanks!
3292 2018-11-21 20:41:00 We get 2% from SAUDI ARABIA. We get most of the oil and gas from CANADA.
3293 2018-11-21 20:40:57 Ahh ok
Get him started on CBD oil...I saw that stuff work some miracles 
3294 2018-11-21 20:40:55 I’ve been using Oil of Olay which is why I can turn 63 and look 62
3295 2018-11-21 20:40:53 May be she does and it doesn’t get air time, shout about deforestation,plastic in the ocean, endangered animal trade , palm oil to etc please
3296 2018-11-21 20:40:46 Tea tree oil helps. Or witch hazel.
3297 2018-11-21 20:40:40 Lol.... great in depth analysis Ned....I guess that's one way to rebut a valid point.... #Obamabinlyin kisses Saudi rump .... while Trump makes them cut oil prices to benefit the US.... 

You've got your Masters in denial
3298 2018-11-21 20:40:37 Saudi Arabia supplies 11% of US oil.  Canada supplies 40%.  I think you are thanking the wrong country.  Plus, Canada didn't kill anyone.
3299 2018-11-21 20:40:33 I don’t care if MAGA folk saw Putin handing Trump stock certificates for Rosneft oil he took, they wouldn’t believe lying eyes
3300 2018-11-21 20:40:30 For what,not standing for with American values?
Your praising that monster for Selling us out for his personal business dealings with Saudi Arabia “they  buy 50-60 million dollar apartments from me” !  
Lol if you believe this let me tell you about this wonderful snake oil 4sale
3301 2018-11-21 20:40:30 There is no upper limit in the number of innocent children that Trump would “sacrifice” for cheap Saudi oil.   @zerohedge @sahouraxo @RaniaKhalek
3302 2018-11-21 20:40:29 If truth be known the US gets 40% of it’s oil supply from Canada
Yes, that Canada that #Trump shits on, our PM @JustinTrudeau , our healthcare system & our agriculture, just to name a few

Whereas,the US imports only 11% from Saudi Arabia 

Why the discrepancy?
1/2
3303 2018-11-21 20:40:26 チャーリーさん、どーしたんだろうな…
3304 2018-11-21 20:40:16 Stop drilling oil out of the ground and stop burning it! Hypocrites
3305 2018-11-21 20:40:13 I don’t know about low oil prices, but I know I pay more for fuel then when Obama was in office.
3306 2018-11-21 20:40:11 Give Trudeau’s handlers some credit. Rejecting pipelines outright would alienate the West.

In creating barriers, bureaucracy, and years of red tape, Trudeau can accomplish his goal of shutting in the oil sands, while claiming to support the industry. #cdnpoli #ableg
3307 2018-11-21 20:40:08 We are also on track to being the world's largest oil exporter.
3308 2018-11-21 20:40:06 油を固めて捨てるの面倒でしょう？僕に渡してくれたらいいよ。あ、固めて渡してくれてもいいよ。
3309 2018-11-21 20:40:04 I love all the lights during Christmas time. Like my oil light, and the check engine light. So magical.
3310 2018-11-21 20:40:04 Family Nutrition: General Mills #Bugles this November? Its top four ingredients are corn meal, coconut oil, sugar and salt.
3311 2018-11-21 20:40:02 First of all you talk shit because the saudi's don't control world oil prices, they do however control U.S oil prices because you won't buy from any other oil producing country, which means they can charge American Citizens whatever they want, selling out America 2 saudi's
3312 2018-11-21 20:40:00 Gauvin being Deputy Premier after his statements on working with the People's Alliance certainly looks like he was bought.
3313 2018-11-21 20:40:00 Does anyone really believe this is about arms sales or oil prices? It’s personal not country one suspects. Prior bailouts and possibly ongoing ones for personal and family finances and businesses only
3314 2018-11-21 20:39:57 Getting my oil changed. I can’t wait to hear them tell me the million things that are wrong with my car
3315 2018-11-21 20:39:51 Trump's choices have shocked me! If only all countries could put aside financial worries and focus on human rights, the message would ring loud and clear across the planet: NO HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSE WILL BE TOLERATED FROM ANYONE, even top oil producers. Increase domestic production!!
3316 2018-11-21 20:39:47 Our body has a endocannabinoid system so yes CBD Oil is good for us...
3317 2018-11-21 20:39:33 You can ship FAR more product using the existing pipelines after refining, than you can raw crude oil or bitumen/dilbit.
3318 2018-11-21 20:39:31 When would it really matter? When a D in VA is beaten by one vote, or when the R is beaten by one vote?
3319 2018-11-21 20:39:16 Trump pursues a senseless policy with Saudi Arabia and Israel that would cut off a million or more barrels a day of Iran’s oil, which would only increase the global price along with the suffering of the Iranian people. Thanks Saudi Arabia, which Trump is relying on to help him.
3320 2018-11-21 20:39:15 Do you really think the whole oil industry randomly appeared out of nowhere within a few years? It had to be built to where it is today, the same as renewable energy sources.
3321 2018-11-21 20:39:14 When you refuse to embrace new types of renewable energy, so you personally wash the innocent blood off the hands of those who supply you with oil for a discount.
3322 2018-11-21 20:39:13 @IbnSiqilli Nothing gladdens Americans like cheap sweet crude.I wish Saudi led OPEC will stop using $ standard for crude oil sale
3323 2018-11-21 20:39:13 And that box be slippery like I’m tryna walk on oil 
3324 2018-11-21 20:39:13 No thanks, keep the blood oil.
3325 2018-11-21 20:39:11 Maxine need an oil change
3326 2018-11-21 20:39:04 A bottle of spearmint essential oil broke at home. Now it feels like we’re living at the Wrigley’s gum factory. And not the Juicy Fruit section.
3327 2018-11-21 20:38:51 FYI TYRANT DUMP:  THE UNITED STATES HAS NOT RELIED ON OIL FROM SAUDI ARABIA SINCE THE 1990’S!!!!  PRICES OF OIL HAVE GONE DOWN DUE TO FRACKING!!!!
3328 2018-11-21 20:38:49 Patriotism and nationalism isn't the same thing. Also, freedom of speech exists in most countries.

Socialism was not the reason for Venezuela's problem. They put too much into oil.

Also, every country is socialist to some degree.
3329 2018-11-21 20:38:49 No oil
3330 2018-11-21 20:38:48 What’s sad is that you value the price of oil but not the price of blood.

America’s moral leadership has virtually evaporated under your presidency.
3331 2018-11-21 20:38:48 It is. We also still supply a good percentage of our own oil through technological  improvements in retrieving oil from spent wells and also finding new reserves.
3332 2018-11-21 20:38:47 Why? They‘re a company who wants to grow and needs money. That’s what venture capital is there to do. It‘s perfectly fine.

And VC can‘t be accused of being nearly the string-puller that banks, oil companies, etc. are.
3333 2018-11-21 20:38:44 I just got oil put in but it’s not blowing hot air and it’s a blinking green light
3334 2018-11-21 20:38:43 It’s nuts ! Boil an egg and cut the yolk and white up separately, with breadcrumbs, capers , olive oil. Never heard of this in my life !!!
3335 2018-11-21 20:38:42 I think truffle oil is no good for people with sensory issues in hindsight - don’t give aspies truffle oil
3336 2018-11-21 20:38:41 Senior Credit Controller and Sales Ledger Manager for a heating oil supplier.... lol
3337 2018-11-21 20:38:36 do we still get oil from the Saudi
3338 2018-11-21 20:38:30 Oil futures just wiped out stock market gains for all of 2018... That is happening now btw.
3339 2018-11-21 20:38:25 Hope he was not given red oil
3340 2018-11-21 20:38:24 You have to be very careful when selecting CBD oil. Only purchase from a trusted source. Evidently there are many fakes.
3341 2018-11-21 20:38:12 LOL. See you're in Aboyne. Used to live there. Always seemed to have a heating oil panic over Xmas. Now I have mains gas, it's such a luxury!
3342 2018-11-21 20:38:08 Meditation and CBD oil
3343 2018-11-21 20:38:05 Go Tulsi! No better way to say this truth   Trump is clearly bought and paid for. Time to take back America with leadership that creates a sustainable future of prosperity and peace, our dependency on oil and wars needs to end and it can!  #OffFossilFuels #Tulsi2020
3344 2018-11-21 20:37:59 Hmmm... And I'm trading TVIX, it has been spectacular so far. 

Soon time to bet on an upswing in oil, I think. 

Sorry guys, but my outlook is gloomier than it was in 2007.
3345 2018-11-21 20:37:58 You ask me thr oil prices are low just to keep the rest of the world happy over them kill that journalist.
3346 2018-11-21 20:37:54 Gwarimpa sir
3347 2018-11-21 20:37:45 If this Nation sits IDLE & INDIFFERENT to Trumps backing of Saudi Arabia in the Name of Jobs, Cheap Oil, Arms Sales, we have Sold Human Dignity and have LOST the SOUL of this Nation! 
3348 2018-11-21 20:37:44 "Bicuitier" ???

Has James been drinking the Palm Oil?
3349 2018-11-21 20:37:39 If the US can no longer afford to station men & missiles a few hundred miles from Russia's borders b/c Saudi prices oil in CNY, does giving up some market share to Saudi strengthen Russia's position or weaken?  Never mind if Saudi bids for gold w/CNY (Russia's been buying gold.)
3350 2018-11-21 20:37:33 Trump lies again the reason prices went up were do to Trump’s sanctions on Iran. The reason prices are dropping USA is producing more than the Saudi’s more than 
Trump thanks Saudis for lower oil price after defending kingdom over Khashoggi murder - CNBC
3351 2018-11-21 20:37:32 I gotta start doing my own oil changes more often cause I’m not boutta pay these shops for they half ass oil changes & my father gettin older lol
3352 2018-11-21 20:37:15 Oil and arms are secondary to him. They purchase Trump condos in NYC et al. for cash. Never was it M.A.G.A., but M.T.G.A. (Make Trump Great Again)!
3353 2018-11-21 20:37:11 Is that a threat??? Unless we capitulate to your regime you'll cut off all Saudi oil to the USA? Yeah, right...
3354 2018-11-21 20:37:08 Shell look at the results...”nah lets drill for more oil and gas! Yippee!”
3355 2018-11-21 20:37:07 Trump lies again the reason prices went up were do to Trump’s sanctions on Iran. The reason prices are dropping USA is producing more than the Saudi’s more than

3356 2018-11-21 20:37:05 demise of traditional oil is highly overated by greens who ignore needs of industrial,marine,transportation and agricultural sectors that cant run on solar or wind to be competitive,in most cases it will be decades until we accept nuclear as the only real replacement for diesel
3357 2018-11-21 20:37:01 Oh god! Blood oil 
3358 2018-11-21 20:36:50 Having Brian Topp on her "committee" is a damn joke. The man hates oil & gas. This decision ranks right up there with putting that idiot Tzeporah Berman on her oil sand advisory committee. For Notley to put Topp in that position is a thumb in the eye of Albertians.

3360 2018-11-21 20:36:41 If you so concerned about deforestation then avoiding palm oil does mean ‘shit’ smh
3361 2018-11-21 20:36:39 Where is it stated that the Postmedia newspapers have a mandate to support oil companies?
3362 2018-11-21 20:36:38 I think he must go.... big oil money
3363 2018-11-21 20:36:34 I just read that we get most of our oil from Canada. Don't know if it's true.
3364 2018-11-21 20:36:32 was up way too late reading about palm oil and yemen last night. stay woke indeed.
3365 2018-11-21 20:36:31 No, my definition is not subjective. It is an objective fact that gerrymandering is voter suppression. Voter suppression is literally the point of gerrymandering. You’re using a lot of word now incorrectly. Time to let it go pal.
3366 2018-11-21 20:36:29 If one Mans life is not worth protecting, let's trade Trump for a Barrel of oil, or maybe a Gallon of gas, I'll call the Prince and barter for the best we can get.
3367 2018-11-21 20:36:22 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, your boasting of lower oil prices from the Saudis is quid pro quo, pass on murder for lower oil prices. We have abundant US oil supplies.  A murder has occurred. This is complex. This is not a business deal for you to gain personally.
3368 2018-11-21 20:36:20 Which is apparently Trumpspeak for “yes, if they lower the price of oil and I can take credit for it.”
3369 2018-11-21 20:36:11 Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
3370 2018-11-21 20:36:11 He’s tweeting about the lower prices of oil that was paid for by the blood of #JamalKhashoggi
3371 2018-11-21 20:36:09 Well, you may be right. But if you’ve been reading the news you’ve seen OPEC is in a bind because the US has developed a way to still be profitable drilling oil even at $30 per barrel. So we are starting to impact their wealth.
3372 2018-11-21 20:36:08 Oh I do apologize James, the only ones you trust are on the oil lobby's payroll 
3373 2018-11-21 20:36:01 @realDonaldTrump oil prices were supposed to lower right! I paid 300 dollars for 150 gallons of oil to heat my home and this is not even filling my tank up. Today i ordered 150 gallons of oil  and was told that the prices have  changed and now i will pay 500 dollars.
3374 2018-11-21 20:35:57 Soo did I have this right. Everytime America gets a Tax Cut on oil prices from Saudi Arabia another US journalist was murdered.
3375 2018-11-21 20:35:56 I prefer my marrow baked in the oven with herb infused olive oil lolol
3376 2018-11-21 20:35:56 "oil paints are so expensive..."
3377 2018-11-21 20:35:53 You are right,  but what if the Saudi's knew that we would blame Iraq and thereby attack their enemy.  What if the fix was in all the way back to Cheney?  If Trump can stop U.S. production then Saudi oil is wealth again. All Saudi's have is oil and SAND.
3378 2018-11-21 20:35:51 WE NEED TO ACT IMMEDIATELY TO TRY YES JUST TRY TO SAVE OUR PLANET!!!!!  GOP AND OIL CORPORATIONS & THEIR BIG DONORS STOP DENYING SCIENCE NOW!!!!!
3379 2018-11-21 20:35:49 Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
3380 2018-11-21 20:35:48 She’s in a bind. Scotland is very reliant on a declining value resource. Oil. So independence is a pipe dream
3381 2018-11-21 20:35:46 girls? make sure y’all check y’all oil in y’all car
3382 2018-11-21 20:35:46 Good one  Alex ! I did not know that the government made up the price of oil.
3383 2018-11-21 20:35:45 This is sad but it is true. In my country, the armed groups, which claim to be defenders of people & the environment, dynamite the pipeline & produce constant oil spills in our rivers & forests, & the international community says nothing. Humans will destroy life on the planet.
3384 2018-11-21 20:35:44 I knew Saudi was going to do that with the oil. That’s how they use their power. Saudi and America are an absolute disgrace.
3385 2018-11-21 20:35:40 Btw we all know oil prices are controlled by the coke brothers on Wall Street. Saudi has little to do with the price.
3386 2018-11-21 20:35:37 Engineering lower oil pxs also gives him ammo vs the Fed
3387 2018-11-21 20:35:36 I'll be on @allinwithchris tonight discussing the obvious deal #Trump made with #MbS to keep #oil prices down #Khashoggi @MSNBC
3388 2018-11-21 20:35:34 Is fun how every oil change advertised for $29.99 oil turns to $65.99! Totally love it.
3389 2018-11-21 20:35:32 My roommates gf is getting her oil changed and the dude asked “what kind of oil is in your car?” Like shouldn’t you know, dude?
3390 2018-11-21 20:35:19 At this point the Saudis need is more than we need them. Let’s not also forget that thanks to shale fracking and oil from Canada we no longer need Saudi oil.
3391 2018-11-21 20:35:16 Vegan brownies that taste like fudge! All you need is brownie mix and black beans (you don’t even need water or oil). Drain the black beans & stir into brownie mix & bake normally. They’re amazing!
3392 2018-11-21 20:35:15 We import 40% of our oil from Canada, 11% from Saudi Arabia and falling. We export more oil than we import and on track to being world's largest exporter. But hey, #SaudiArabiaFirst
3393 2018-11-21 20:35:15 he does realize you import more oil from #Canada right?...oooh sorry that would require him reading my bad what a donut head #Trump
3394 2018-11-21 20:35:11 You realize most of your oil comes from us .
3395 2018-11-21 20:35:05 In summary an Indy Scot will attract the max triple A credit rating compared to rUK AA+ amongst all the major global credit agencies which gives you an idea how affluent we could be without the drag of UK. Westminster has lied about our Oil and suppresed this not better together
3396 2018-11-21 20:35:00 (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco will sign five crude oil supply agreements with Chinese customers, it said in a statement on Wednesday, taking the volume of its 2019 China crude oil supply agreements to 1.67 million barrels per day.

Bear in mind Pakistan is poor, KSA isn't.
3397 2018-11-21 20:34:55 Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
You should be thankful for Canada not KSA if you were honest.
Who is publishing FAKE NEWS now, You or CNN ??
We wait for @Acosta to ask you this question 
3398 2018-11-21 20:34:52 CBC seriously don't know how oil prices are kept low by Saudi Arabia selling oil on the world market?
3399 2018-11-21 20:34:50 Turns out when you boil a vegetable for 6 hours it tastes like shit. Who knew?

Roasted with oil sp and craisins.
3400 2018-11-21 20:34:46 If you’re out on the road be careful! There’s a lot of motor oil on the roads that gets washed away during rain and makes the roads extra slick. Drive careful for the youth! They are the future!!
3401 2018-11-21 20:34:45 Kalo obat jerawat pake tea tre oil nya the body shop. Sekali oles langsung kering.
3402 2018-11-21 20:34:36 All the “Christains” that elected trump to “fix the economy” now have to live with the fact that he openly supports the bombing of innocent and starving Yemen children for the sake of keeping oil prices down.(FYI we make most of our own) That’s exactly what Jesus would’ve wanted
3403 2018-11-21 20:34:36 Yeah, don’t mix water and boiling oil
3404 2018-11-21 20:34:36 Well it looks like I will be taking a hot shower as soon as I get home. I have a large amount of engine oil in my hair and it's all that I can smell. Dont care about it in the hair but the smell is driving me nuts.
3405 2018-11-21 20:34:31 Yeah, that's great - except.  Saudi Arabia literaly just murdered a journalist who dared speak in opposition to the royal family, and tried (poorly) to cover it up, and 40% of your oil comes from Canada.  

You absolute moron.
3406 2018-11-21 20:34:31 They only supply 11% of your oil right? Canada 40%?
3407 2018-11-21 20:34:29 Dear Ed  you should know that:  America didn't assassinate Iraq why Saddam Hussein killed his own people. It occupied there for oil. The secondly Bin Laden was a puppet. He couldn't  do anything but  America's  knowledge . I mean they were plan . I support you against Trump.
3408 2018-11-21 20:34:28 Can somebody plz tell me why this girl is using WATER to mix with OIL PAINT...
3409 2018-11-21 20:34:28 Outraged....  What about the environment off east coast?  The erm um biggest oil spill now taking place... Outraged about that???   Hmmm
3410 2018-11-21 20:34:26 SMH we produce more oil than those murderers, & we don’t cut American journalists up into little pieces!(YET)
3411 2018-11-21 20:34:25 Guess you do not realize we only get 11% of our oil from Saudi Arabia.
3412 2018-11-21 20:34:20 You are strengthening our dependence on the Middle East our domestic oil producers will starve now. You just don’t get it Mr. Plump
3413 2018-11-21 20:34:20 We should see our oil giveaway as an opportunity to separate. The only reason to have an Eastern Canada for us Westerners was to get our products to market. Now, w/Energy East dead, we can leave.  

If they were separated w/less income, they would be open for business.
3414 2018-11-21 20:34:12 @H_Combs @PlasticPollutes Plastic is becoming a planet wide toxic waste problem & should be treated like depleated uranium or engine oil or something. Special places for it to be stored & not just thrown away Should be stricter rules on it's production IMHO
3415 2018-11-21 20:34:05 Today I learned there has been a 14 year, ongoing oil spill occurring since 2004. Just slowly leaking 1 million barrels of oil over this period. 

???????
3416 2018-11-21 20:34:01 And, yes! I know your next retro will be some version of “it’s the messenger not the message” because we all know it’s bullshit. I mean sure, a better snake oil salesman sells more snake oil, but the shit’s still the same snake oil.
3417 2018-11-21 20:33:50 Way to go Trump on trying to deflect the Saudi comments from the Jamal Khashoggi murder to lower oil prices. You are really a mess!
3418 2018-11-21 20:33:48 Worst American president ever. Stop using Oil by helping the Saudi’s and support Electric car companies like Tesla!
3419 2018-11-21 20:33:47 1000% positive my brother is gonna have a weed based thanksgiving just cause he came up on a method of how to make oil lmao.
3420 2018-11-21 20:33:36 You know it's far more complicated than that. Iran and the Kingdom hate each other, and the enemy of our enemy is our friend. Plus, you don't just tell the largest oil producer in the world to jump in the lake, even when you're the second largest. The world still runs on oil.
3421 2018-11-21 20:33:32 If the Saudis join Russia, Iran, Venezuela, Kazakhstan and others in multi-currency oil pricing, de-dollarization is all but complete - the world's need to hold USDs will be permanently & dramatically reduced & the US will not be able to afford DoD, Entitlmts AND Int Expense.
3422 2018-11-21 20:33:30 And keeping my oil prices down because I don’t care about the people I represent. I just care about winning!!!!!
3423 2018-11-21 20:33:28 Where’s then proof it actually is an issue?
3424 2018-11-21 20:33:28 And that is why you people are afraid of Biafran succession because you know you are too lazy and can't survive without our oil.
3425 2018-11-21 20:33:26 Surely a coal-fired power station is a bit too futuristic and lefty!

What happened to good old whale oil!!
3426 2018-11-21 20:33:23 Helped crush the American oil industry.
3427 2018-11-21 20:33:23 Thank you Saudi Arabia, please proceed offing whomever you see fit. Lower oil prices are good for my ratings.
3428 2018-11-21 20:33:21 I’m real weary of the homemade oil carts with no legit cannabis company behind them. Do u know exactly what you’re inhaling because it says Pineapple Express or some other fruity shxt on it? What other “natural” flavors did u extract when u extracted the thc oil from the plant?
3429 2018-11-21 20:33:21 Olive oil, fuckton of garlic, salt, pepper, lemon

Bam
3430 2018-11-21 20:33:21 Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
3431 2018-11-21 20:33:16 Castor oil treatments will make it grow faster and super hydrate you!
3432 2018-11-21 20:33:15 We Canadians are your largest importer of oil you dolt! 40% of imports come from us and you can be damn sure that we didn't order the murder of anyone!
3433 2018-11-21 20:33:03 The US currently produces more oil than Saudi Arabia. Trump eased production sanctions on Iran, clearing the way for even more oil to flood the market. The effect will be depressed prices.
3434 2018-11-21 20:33:01 At $54 dollars a barrel, oil is reaching into unprofitable drilling pricing. US rigs will start shutting down. Do your homework before tweeting out stuff that you know little about.

3437 2018-11-21 20:32:51 Oh no, they are shit. I personally think it's criminal that their country is on top of America's oil.
3438 2018-11-21 20:32:37 This is so dumb.  You need massive oil reserves first.  #keepbombing
3439 2018-11-21 20:32:29 Oil is in a bearish trend , doesn’t look good for OPEC Russia but US seem to be “ winning “ the battle although those sanctions on Iran aren’t in as good effect .. oil is still being exported . Good news for us though.
3440 2018-11-21 20:32:28 Stressed out, uptight and tearful!  This calls for a hot bath, lavender oil and hot chocolate!
3441 2018-11-21 20:32:27 The guy changing my oil
3442 2018-11-21 20:32:26 Think of us whilst you're on your big comfy trains.....we'll be the ones travelling back to 1860 in a time machine powered by Jacob Rees-Mogg's hair oil and the tears of children in the workhouse  (I need to joke or I'll cry....)
3443 2018-11-21 20:32:24 Who cares about a Saudi journalist killed in Turkey? Only Putin, Erdogan and Trump haters. So many people around the world get killed that nobody really cares about.... In Brazil 64.000 per year get murdered and nobody cares because they don’t play a role in oil world...
3444 2018-11-21 20:32:22 True enough, we legitimized the House of Saud to protect our oil interests in 1935 and were not about to give that up no matter how many journalists they kill or how many Osama bin Laden's and suicide pilots they send us!
3445 2018-11-21 20:32:19 Put the turkey in the pot then fill with cold water until turkey is just covered.  Then remove turkey and mark the spot where the water comes up to. Fill up oil to this spot and turkey won’t overflow the oil.
3446 2018-11-21 20:32:18 On at least four occasions, four different Liberal governments helped and/or bailed out AB’s oil industry. Please name one thing the Conservatives did for AB.
3447 2018-11-21 20:32:14 Using your moms praying oil to rejuvenate your scalp>>> buying your own
3448 2018-11-21 20:32:09 Cue the belching smokestacks! Makes a change from cue the oil soaked ducks!
3449 2018-11-21 20:32:08 I don’t get how some people just don’t drive... I’ll drop my car off for an hour to get an oil change and I’m ready to have a mental breakdown.
3450 2018-11-21 20:32:06 They can keep their damn oil in the ground or they can sell it elsewhere, we will get along very well without it, thank you.

3452 2018-11-21 20:32:00 Canada supplies more oil to the US
3453 2018-11-21 20:31:59 Turning a blind eye to a journalist’s murder by direct order of Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince only makes it likely more will die when it suits their goals. Oil be damned. You have failed us, again, Sir.
3454 2018-11-21 20:31:53 I personally would love for President Trump, to get invited to a “OPEC” meeting! It would be “life” to see the look on Iran’s Oil ambassador’s face as he sits across a table from the new “Boss” of “OPEC .com” Trump is OPEC! He’s making OPEC great for the 1st time!  !
3455 2018-11-21 20:31:53 I'm obsessed with Broughs. It was my first twitter avatar. Just lovely looking beasts, even if they are the size of an oil tanker.
3456 2018-11-21 20:31:51 Oil Money ($10.80) pulls clear to win the Zia Juvenile under Orlando Mojica. After dueling with odds/on Stupify, the J P's Gusto colt finished with good energy to win by 3 1/2 lengths in a time of 1:09.06 for the 6 fur. Hotrodlincoln was a clear 2nd, with Stupify fading to 3rd.

3458 2018-11-21 20:31:48 ALL IT TAKES IS A LITTLE OLIVE OIL TO GET THING SLIDING AGAIN. REDUCED COEFFICIENT OF FRICTION! I WOULD NOT SHIT YOU!! YOU ARE MY FAVORITE TURD!!!
3459 2018-11-21 20:31:46 With a French Name like Jean Claude you should know 47 people died 2 years ago in Quebec & it was caused by a Train crash carrying NORTH DAKOTA USA  OIL & Quebec is still buying it.
47 Quebecers dead but that’s ok as long as there’s no Pipeline line to Quebec. What sick bunch!
3460 2018-11-21 20:31:40 @wbpictures if you huys would take a second to use your access to the sattlite you could look at the cops trafficing drugs look at cargo ships taking oil gold and silver from the middle East without pay and prove my story and help the world without a single arrest
3461 2018-11-21 20:31:38 Or bollocks! Only 11% of US oil imports come from Saudi and they are actually putting the prices up. So he's such an idiot that he thinks he's getting a back hander when he's losing money
3462 2018-11-21 20:31:25 Good morning South Sudan. We are seeking investors for our oil- rich land. This is a potential economic game changer for our country with the right investors and opportunities.
3463 2018-11-21 20:31:22 Castor oil or coconut oil! Hope you find a good solution that works for her x
3464 2018-11-21 20:31:16 Over the years the price of oil barrels has not varied so much....And it makes me wonder why gas prices have skyrocketed. Sad how Americans screw each other like this!
3465 2018-11-21 20:31:14 It's all BS and more propaganda claiming SA is solely responsible for lower prices. Yes, they did increase supply but that was because of the sanctions on Iran. But the major importers of Iranian oil were given waivers so now there is an over-supply.
3466 2018-11-21 20:31:11 Trump's dismissal of a man's life bcuz Saudis own lots of oil and are good trading partners is such an explicit betrayal of the fundamentals of human life that it proves Trump will chose money over humanity.  I didn't think he could go any lower but he has, a chilling betrayal.
3467 2018-11-21 20:31:11 Maybe we should murder some more people if it will make oil cheaper.
3468 2018-11-21 20:31:09 You've fallen for the old 'oil is running out' myth. Haven't you read about the 3 new oil fields?  Not that we even need oil. Scotch Whisky alone accounts for over 20% of all *UK* food and drink exports. We export power and water to England. Please worry about yourselves, not us.
3469 2018-11-21 20:31:09 You think you're the second coming of the the great and terrible OZ but we all see  behind the curtain.
Thank everyone with a green car, and users of green energy. Gas prices dropped in large part due to drop in demand world wide. Trump policies  oil demand and are anti-green.
3470 2018-11-21 20:31:07 Yes Saudi should be thanked for it’s efforts to stabilize the world oil market  and the worlds economy. Instead of sarcasm you should look more on what Saudi Arabia give to the world from economic and humanitarian projects, I hope gives you an idea
3471 2018-11-21 20:31:05 Oil prices were way lower before you got in office. Gas was almost under 2 dollars a gallon. Try getting it back to that. Before you try to take or give others credit for it.
3472 2018-11-21 20:31:02 You do not trade our American values for oil money. #shameless @potus
3473 2018-11-21 20:31:01 Gas prices still high. A journalist’s death in exchange for lower oil costs? How about we exchange a lower economy for a new president?
3474 2018-11-21 20:30:51 I bet if you cook them in a little sunflower oil they'll taste exactly right.
3475 2018-11-21 20:30:48 But does this mean you actually agree with Trump’a stance to be so soft on Saudi Arabia because they are loaded and buy weapons and control the price of oil? I don’t know if she does pal around or not, but I agree with her words (however take issue if she’s being a hypocrite)
3476 2018-11-21 20:30:46 Don't let the facts get in the way of your lying narrative #WaPo where truth goes to die. #FakeNews propagandists now demanding to assess the "report"... same guys who said we'd find WMD in Iraq. Sure some real experts there... more like Deep State objectives not fact.

3480 2018-11-21 20:30:31 Ugh god bless you. Whatever you do, don’t take castor oil 
3481 2018-11-21 20:30:30 As long as the president stays beholden to oil and gas, all sorts of garbage will continue in the name of making money.

3484 2018-11-21 20:30:23 Scot does not run a deficit it is not allowed to the GERS fig is merely an apportionment of all UK debt /gdp.  Norway extracted less Oil than UK yet accumulated £1trn of wealth funds denied us by G BRown.  This attracts £125bn pa (3x scot GDP) and 3trillion barrels min still.
3485 2018-11-21 20:30:19 AAA estimates over 360,000 motorists will need roadside assistant this #Thanksgiving holiday. Before a #roadtrip, make sure you double check your oil, fluids, tire pressure and battery!
3486 2018-11-21 20:30:08 that said, there are different types of shitto so who knows.. but certainly none that I have tasted recently resemble chilli oil
3487 2018-11-21 20:30:04 Iran was kicked out of the Safari Club due to the Islamic Revolution and cut them from OPEC by strengthening Saudi Arabia because they had the largest oil reserves in OPEC. Carter played no in removing the Shah. The Khoemini crowd overthrew the Shah. Thats why the CIA used Sadam
3488 2018-11-21 20:30:03 Spent the last couple days removing this old beast to be replaced with a Worcester Bosch Danesmoor oil boiler. With a full power flush, Worcester magnetic filter for protection and a Nest wi-if thermostat. 
All backed up by Worcester Bosch’s 7 year guarantee.
3489 2018-11-21 20:29:58 My boss just found out about CBd oil. Just got back from his first treatment and is very disappointed  ain’t the same shit you was smoking in college now is it?
3490 2018-11-21 20:29:56 Literally blood for oil
3491 2018-11-21 20:29:52 So while he praises the Saudi's  our oil production is in the shitter.  We can then depend on the Saudi's for all our future oil needs.    What did trump voters expect of a man who has bankrupted 4 casino's and many hotels.
3492 2018-11-21 20:29:51 Looks like we are back to blood for oil again.
3493 2018-11-21 20:29:50 Just saw Trumps tweet from this morning.  More lies. Oil price down because of high production, nothing to do with Saudi Arabia!!
3494 2018-11-21 20:29:45 Okay, this looks like a wonderful table to do a rub down with oil on you Arieee, but that cutting pendulum is 
3495 2018-11-21 20:29:44 Hit them where it hurts. Produce our own oil and quit buying it from them that way we stop sponsoring that uncivilized and barbaric behavior. Without dependence on their oil extreme pressure can be applied to exert change. (And risk them buying their weapons from Russia)
3496 2018-11-21 20:29:29 Oil price not oil source.
3497 2018-11-21 20:29:29 ...and their are other sources of oil quite besides in any case - so no, we don't NEED specifically Saudi oil and we really ought to be well on our way towards a more sustainable, renewable energy economy anyway. If not for the environment then to shed ourselves of these ties.
3498 2018-11-21 20:29:26 When your goal is America and Americans first, other countries aren’t the focus. We got cheaper oil in exchange for turning a blind eye to their murder. There literally isn’t anything we can do.
3499 2018-11-21 20:29:22 Only 11% of our oil comes from the Saudis, while 40% comes from Canada. Sooo. We dont even need them for that. Its ridiculous thats he's siding with the Saudis, when they dismembered a journalist and then dissolvwd his body parts in acid. Im embarrassed for our country.
3500 2018-11-21 20:29:21 Canada provides the U.S. with 4 times as much petroleum as Saudi Arabia. So who is more responsible for lower US oil prices?  You’re welcome.
3501 2018-11-21 20:29:16 Now let me correct you and make my point; 
The oil is not even from(not for) the Southeast(not East); it's from(not for) the southsouth; stop claiming what's not yours. Imo and Abia contribute but my point is that Biafra is what is in question, which  is the Eastern part of NGA.
3502 2018-11-21 20:29:14 You ARE aware that Saudi Arabia 1) was the homeland of many of the 9-11 hijackers 2) finance anti-American, anti-Semitic madrassas around the world 3) refer to Americans as their "oil slaves"?
3503 2018-11-21 20:29:13 nope.. and its nothing against chilli oil, i just don't think they taste alike
3504 2018-11-21 20:29:12 Probably be cheaper yet if Iranian oil was still on the market. Wouldn't have to kiss the Saudi's rear end if Iranian oil filled the Potential Saudi void. We sanction Iran, support the Saudis. What do they have on you?
3505 2018-11-21 20:28:54 They sound amazing!  I made Italian donuts last year. It’s just soft pizza dough dropped in dollops in hot oil then sprinkled with sugar.
3506 2018-11-21 20:28:50 Lol!!!!   The empty barrels are worth more than the oil.... Well done Trudeau!!!  Well done!
3507 2018-11-21 20:28:48 If it’s a lot- massage olive oil into the resin then wash thoroughly with shampoo and comb out to make sure it’s all gone
3508 2018-11-21 20:28:38 Hey, how many journalists does a guy have to murder to get $30 a barrel oil around here? You're an embarrassment.
3509 2018-11-21 20:28:32 His walking away from Green technology is what drove up oil prices. There has been a glut of oil for several years, and prices were below $33 per barrel.
After he touched their globe and danced with a sword, prices rose, why to pay for the arms he was selling 

Connect the dots.
3510 2018-11-21 20:28:30 Ok do you mean finance or investing?
3511 2018-11-21 20:28:27 We get most of our oil from Canada fool.
3512 2018-11-21 20:28:27 Ok so they literally cut up one of our own citizens... but sure thank them for lowering oil prices.
3513 2018-11-21 20:28:26 though Oil Money won, and all i can think of is the Beavis and Butt-Head episode where they think they struck oil...

"Black Gold...Texas Tea..."
"Oil rules!"
3514 2018-11-21 20:28:22 The thing on new #US sanctios on #Russia,#Iran over oil shipment to #Syria is it's deemed"illegal"/"smuggling"only under US law.Regardless of one's feelings visavis #Assad,his gov still #UN-recognized & oil shipment to SYR not illegal under interlational law.
3515 2018-11-21 20:28:21 Trump is an accessory after the fact to murder, but what the hell, the Saudi’s lowered oil prices, and yet there are those that will continue to champion Trump. Self interest over values has become the new American credo.
3516 2018-11-21 20:28:20 I wanted to do a truffle Mac n cheese this year but the first store I went to didn’t have truffle oil and i decided that was more than enough stores for me for today.
3517 2018-11-21 20:28:18 Don’t sleep on Subways philly cheese steak tell em a little bit of bell pepper and a little of bit of red onion and sprinkle some oil on that hoe. Thank me later
3518 2018-11-21 20:28:14 X
3519 2018-11-21 20:28:05 @MSNBC the reason Trump is pushing the "Lock Her Up" tack is to take the MSM short, short, tiny attention span off of Kashoggi's murder. And you ALL fall right in line. And Trump thanking the Saudi's for keeping the price of oil down...
3520 2018-11-21 20:27:55 This tweet sounds like Saudi Arabia lowered oil prices in exchange for the USA not punishing SA for murdering Khashoggi. Putin will be mad oil prices are lower though, so they'll go up again, just watch.
3521 2018-11-21 20:27:51 Oil is a worldwide market

3523 2018-11-21 20:27:40 This is Nigeria. I use back to sender oil
3524 2018-11-21 20:27:39 Brett,i blame the way royalties reduce firstwhen prices go down,if a base royalty price was imposed the large oil giants couldn't move thier really cheap ab oil onto thier Nebraska refiners and make a killing there. effectivey it woud make a floor price for everyone,
3525 2018-11-21 20:27:38 Free capital good book
3526 2018-11-21 20:27:34 Since the USA is currently the world leader in oil production...doesn't lower oil prices actually negatively effect the US economy? Well, certanly for oil companies. 
And for people owning oil company stocks.

We do not need Saudi Oil.  But Trump might need Saudi Money.
3527 2018-11-21 20:27:32 Imho...oil price is dropping, KSA made some deal with Trump, now they back fighting for market share...they have sold to China for ever...its about market share in a oil crash (as if has been every oil crash) ..not ccy
3528 2018-11-21 20:27:30 So you don’t think shitto taste like chilli oil?
3529 2018-11-21 20:27:25 my ideal store: spices, tea, and olive oil + balsamic vinegar. and rice. and fruit. thats all though
3530 2018-11-21 20:27:20 How about Canada? Don’t they supply like four times the amount of oil that Saudi Arabia does? Bonus - they don’t murder US based journalists with 3 US citizen children.
3531 2018-11-21 20:27:20 Well one by a 'popular' author who has written books on finance, stock markets...thanks Justin.
3532 2018-11-21 20:27:20 Turns out Flora ain't dead she's just a thirsty bitch like her owner. Got you some oil n coolant drink up girl X
3533 2018-11-21 20:27:13 Oil companies jacking up pricing. Weird. #heatingProblems
3534 2018-11-21 20:27:13 President Trump thanked Saudi Arabia for keeping oil prices low Wednesday despite the CIA concluding that the Saudi crown prince had murdered an American journalist. Said Trump: “We’re going to make a killing.”
3535 2018-11-21 20:27:12 Hi @HaPOrangutanOrg  advises where food products do contain palm oil or may contain palm oil. We remain to be convinced by effectiveness of RSPO

3537 2018-11-21 20:27:11 Try CBD oil - it helps a lot of things, but can be expensive.
3538 2018-11-21 20:27:06 Shame on you @CNBC ! I refuse to even listen to this liar & snake oil salesman. Did you ask him about the women he tortured this week? Why not talk to @amnestyusa @amnestygulf about what MBS is sanctioning?
3539 2018-11-21 20:27:04 The U.S. imports %11 of its oil from Saudi Arabia, Canada %40
3540 2018-11-21 20:27:03 Canada gives more oil, it’s more then that.
3541 2018-11-21 20:26:56 That is a disgraceful statement to talk about oil to Saudi Arabia.  Show some strength and conviction.  America is and has been great because it can stand tall against these criminal regimes.  If you lose that, why do you think you are adding to the greatness of America?
3542 2018-11-21 20:26:55 Please @sainsburys could you sell more products without #palmoil Every pack of crackers includes palm oil. That goes for many biscuits too. Please do your bit
3543 2018-11-21 20:26:54 The Sauds flog their oil to the any willing buyer on the open market, and there's little indication that an as embargo would see cause them to cease that tradition and emargo the UK. There's certainly not the unity necessary to enforce a broader OPEC embargo of the UK...
3544 2018-11-21 20:26:51 One thing Slats always knew, and  McL sorta knows is that player chemistry is vital. Putting McD and Drai together really makes a lot of sense because of their chemistry. RNH has to develop chemistry with a winger ASAP. JP is my guy. They have to play together now not later.
3545 2018-11-21 20:26:50 I’m brainstorming dream TED talks. “Korean Skincare Is A Snake Oil Racket” “Middlebrow Is A Concept Designed And Promoted To Move Education Class Goalposts Even Further And Block Class Ascendancy” “Cat People And Dog People Must Unite”
3546 2018-11-21 20:26:46 I really wish I could fast-forward to when oil becomes so difficult to extract from the ground that it costs hundreds of dollars per gallon and ask whatever humans might remain whether all this shit was worth it.
3547 2018-11-21 20:26:46 Oh I am well aware that previous US presidents have also kowtowed to the Saudis. It is time USA become energy independent thru renewables and then tell Saudi Arabia, “Eat & drink your oil.” They need us more than we need them.
3548 2018-11-21 20:26:40 my momma loves the wild growth oil!
3549 2018-11-21 20:26:40 Factoid-> Imported oil to the US from Saudi Arabia amounts to only 11%. The biggest oil importer to the US is CANADA. And Canada is pissed off at you. Nice job dimwit.
3550 2018-11-21 20:26:35 Not so good for American oil producers.
3551 2018-11-21 20:26:35 In the mood for some roasted yam and palm oil mixed with pepper 
3552 2018-11-21 20:26:34 Yup - trading human flesh for oil. What’s wrong with that?
3553 2018-11-21 20:26:24 Now Playing "Former oil worker worries abou" by Climate Connections #PositiveMusic #FamilySafe
3554 2018-11-21 20:26:16 Even worse is being dependent on foreign oil.  I remember the gas shortages in the 70s, and how we cowered in fear every time OPEC met to cut production and raise prices. Getting used to cheaper gas by putting us at the mercy of the Saudis is not “America First”.
3555 2018-11-21 20:26:13 All I am doing is calling out the hypocrites, all of those screaming about the atrocities seem to be ok with importing Saudi oil. We banned blood diamonds, why is this any different?
3556 2018-11-21 20:26:11 I cooked Aberdeen Angus steak with fondant potatoes three times cooked chips au labour sauce and asparagus fried in butter and wine and refreshed with truffle oil - they never had truffle oil and complained about the dish! - “I farted on it” - I need someone to cook for
3557 2018-11-21 20:26:10 Don't let him fool you. It has nothing to do with oil prices or the country. He's looking the other way about brutal murder and torture because Saudi Arabia puts up Trump Hotels. It's always about him, never about the good of the country
3558 2018-11-21 20:26:10 Not to mention the fact that I'd oil goes below $50 a barrel, there will be mass layoffs in the industry. They ALL voted for him
3559 2018-11-21 20:26:09 Got a new battery in my car, all new tires, wheel alignment, ball joints oil changed my car feeling so good
3560 2018-11-21 20:26:08 So this is the art of the deal? I guess we will find out how soulless and immoral we really are if we look the other way when offered lower $/barrels of oil like you have.
3561 2018-11-21 20:26:08 You quite literally don't understand basic economic principles like supply and demand, nor apparently have you heard that your murderous pals are calling to cut oil production.
3562 2018-11-21 20:26:05 I need 10k to start my coconut oil business
3563 2018-11-21 20:25:52 Lol bros, see us killing ourselves over oil when ordinary fake parmesan is more than our budget for 2 years
3564 2018-11-21 20:25:50 Bitcoin != all cryptocurrencies

all cryptocurrencies == snake oil
3565 2018-11-21 20:25:49 Yeah, never mind the murder and dismemberment of a journalist; what really matters is lower oil prices. 

Is this literally blood for oil?
3566 2018-11-21 20:25:49 We currently produce more oil than Saudi Arabia!
3567 2018-11-21 20:25:45 Just in case anyone hasn’t noticed a barrel of oil is still over $53 which is $20 per barrel higher than when he took office.

Everyone is acting like oil dropping is a result of his actions.
3568 2018-11-21 20:25:45 (We get 11% of our oil from them. Something else is going on there.)
3569 2018-11-21 20:25:41 If OBO disappoint you ba i will disappoint him when we enter Villa
3570 2018-11-21 20:25:36 Give & take..elect cars rely on destructive lithium mining..solar & wind rely on cost-effective storage 4 dependability..oil drives economy
3571 2018-11-21 20:25:35 We bait our crab pots with the oiliest fish we can find. Crabs and lobster love oil. My environmental professor in University often suggested that we should simply cover oil spills with sawdust or sand, allow it to clump and let the crustaceans devour it. Oil is not toxin nor
3572 2018-11-21 20:25:34 Omg 
3573 2018-11-21 20:25:33 Having An oil change, car wash, and full tank of gas all feels so good at the same time
3574 2018-11-21 20:25:31 Ed US gets more oil from Canada than SA..
3575 2018-11-21 20:25:30 What type?
3576 2018-11-21 20:25:28 for the same reason he promised he'd get #pipelines built.. given how much PM Trudeau dislikes oil workers...
3577 2018-11-21 20:25:26 Right because oil prices are more important than a man’s life.
3578 2018-11-21 20:25:25 Can we somehow replace the palm oil in Oreos with avocado oil?
3579 2018-11-21 20:25:23 They are good. Cut in half, pan fry in olive oil until crisy then basalmic at end to carmelize.
3580 2018-11-21 20:25:22 I really wish my oil change guys didn’t always make fun of me for being scared to drive in the pit :(
3581 2018-11-21 20:25:16 Lower oil prices are not the tax cut you lied about to Middle America. Next?
3582 2018-11-21 20:25:13 It looks a bit „jelly“ but yeah, why not.
Wait... is there any mineralic oil or grease inside the printer? Then better not.
3583 2018-11-21 20:25:09 Fast? No. It’s too late. Having worked in this industry for over 20 years & spoke with many who’ve been it for longer than that...let me be very clear...this is DONE. Get out now. Canada has killed the oil patch. Blame whoever you want. It’s DONE.
3584 2018-11-21 20:25:08 I stand by my comment because it’s the cost per barrel of oil that has actually dropped and I theorize it’s the Saudi prince buying US silence.
3585 2018-11-21 20:25:04 I agree ! Other countries sell oil not just the Sauies !
3586 2018-11-21 20:24:53 Need to get an oil change
3587 2018-11-21 20:24:46 His tweets should have a special :CHA-CHING: notification sound. "Thank you Saudi Arabia - CHA-CHING - for fixing oil prices (and buying yet another condo!)!"

 #CommanderInThief
#TraitorInChief
3588 2018-11-21 20:24:42 Canada supplies 40% of imported oil to the US. Saudi Arabia supplies 11%. Quit brown nosing tyrants.
3589 2018-11-21 20:24:37 Did you cook your sausages a bit first and make sure your oil was scorching hot before the batter went in?
3590 2018-11-21 20:24:36 U know say u no get liver u go watch 
3591 2018-11-21 20:24:22 Makes sure zimeiva vizuri and also ziive haraka in oil.
3592 2018-11-21 20:24:13 Anyone: hi 
Me: I need CBD oil
3593 2018-11-21 20:24:08 When “America” was “great”, I don’t remember US Presidents thanking a murderous Prince for keeping the oil prices down. I thought only “shithole” countries do that. #maga #thispresidentsucks
3594 2018-11-21 20:24:07 What about the oil used for countless things, such as vehicles? Let's face it, those with the money won't give room to the options that will see them lose any of that money...
3595 2018-11-21 20:24:04 Oil change is the VERY last thing I wanted to pay for today  new car synthetic oil bye bye 100.
3596 2018-11-21 20:24:00 Oil and gas powers so much of our lives and, yes, that includes #Thanksgiving!
3597 2018-11-21 20:23:56 Guess they forget about Obama being the Saudi Bitch and bowing before them. Doesn't matter who the president is in regards to Saudi Arabia, they are a strategic partner in middle east and have the oil wealth that makes everyone handle them with kid gloves and turn head away.
3598 2018-11-21 20:23:53 The orange idiot’s premise isn’t even factual. The US is the #1 oil producer in the world. Saudi Arabia cannot single handily raise/lower crude prices. Even if you put aside Trump’s immorality (I don’t), he doesn’t know shit about what actually impacts the price of oil. 
3599 2018-11-21 20:23:52 Can anyone recommend me a best selling finance book ?
3600 2018-11-21 20:23:52 Drink few drops or oregano oil in a little water as a preventative treatment perhaps. nature's antibiotic 
3601 2018-11-21 20:23:50 Yes with your Norwegian oil money
3602 2018-11-21 20:23:43 Why not thank ALL of the countries who supply our oil? Asking for my Canadian friend.
3603 2018-11-21 20:23:42 We have laws against polluters and against snake oil salesman.
3604 2018-11-21 20:23:35 I thought Saudi Arabia was decreasing the amount of barrels shipped to the US since September and plan on continuing in December? With a goal of decreasing oil barrels and increasing prices, as they have in past? I swore just read something about this today
3605 2018-11-21 20:23:28 hey @altonbrown , should I butter my turkey, or oil it?
3606 2018-11-21 20:23:28 Trump is sending the message to Saudi Prince MbS that USA/Trump has turned a blind eye to the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, and that Saudi Arabia must therefore lower the price of oil. 
Trump has no moral compass; he's all about show and money.
3607 2018-11-21 20:23:25 This is what #ClimateChange looks like. No amount of "cleaning" is going to help.  Immediate action towards oil independence is in order.
3608 2018-11-21 20:23:21 Mr. President, you embarrass us all by your support of Saudi Arabia and it's corrupt regime. Remember, the New York towers were toppled by Saudi pilots and they continually have supported terrorists around the world. And, we no longer need to depend on their oil.
3609 2018-11-21 20:23:17 Donald Trump has just tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to 'a big Tax Cut for America and the World!' In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
3610 2018-11-21 20:23:17 BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR WEAPONS " THAT MAY BE USED ON US OR OUR ALLIES IN THE END " & THE BADLY NEED OIL ! WON'T BE LONG THEY WILL SAY " AMERICA GET OUT OF OUR COUNTRY " WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE RICH " SO THEY CAN USE THERE NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO CONTROL THE WORLD " ! TIRED OF THE BULLY
3611 2018-11-21 20:23:17 Saudi Arabia does not control the price of oil - OPEC does. And American presidents have ZERO control over it, no matter what they say.
3612 2018-11-21 20:23:16 I spend $21,000 on a new car. And it can't include free oil changes for the first year? #iguessnot #mostlyinloans #iseriouslythoughteverythingwasfreeforthefirstyear
3613 2018-11-21 20:23:12 Argan Oil is packed full of repairing and nurturing antioxidants for glowing skin! It’s in our #FrankincenseIntense Eye Cream!
3614 2018-11-21 20:23:05 40% of our imported oil comes from Canada. From Saudi Arabia 11%.
3615 2018-11-21 20:23:03 "Getting the Saudis to gift as much of their oil profits as possible to the U.S., particularly when it boosts large defense contractors, has been a priority of every president since World War II."
400 billion dollars worth, for mostly military, mostly white contractors.
3616 2018-11-21 20:23:01 cool !!
3617 2018-11-21 20:22:59 CSI Halifax and in a packed programme tonight the Greek and Latin scholars in the tenors translated a well known carol. The men strayed into DIY on a Monday. Ezekiel’s door hid Santa with his radio. Virgin oil for salad jam made by Reggie Nostro. Magnificent words
3618 2018-11-21 20:22:58 @DerrickGaffney I disagree with Trumps statements and opinion about Khashoggi's murder. But lower oil prices do nothing to prop up Trumps "struggling" businesses. Lower oil is good for everyone except the oil companies and they are not high on my list of concerns.
3619 2018-11-21 20:22:54 Now @POTUS  you have to understand you can kill Texas with such low oil prices.  About $65 a barrel is where we need to be for it to be profitable for drillers to drill.  That should make gas prices reasonable rate per gallon.
3620 2018-11-21 20:22:51 BTW, the highest Nigeria earned from oil was $28B in 2012 or 13. People are of the wrong impression Nigeria earns SO much. You multiply prevailing oil price with bpd and come up with huge figures; I did the same too until my Chevron friend explained to me.
3621 2018-11-21 20:22:47 worst mistake u   Could ever make is missin an oil change little lady. . *tips hat*
3622 2018-11-21 20:22:45 Those policies being make oil tycoons as wealthy as possible. We’ve done this for decades to preserve a monopoly on oil in the region; now that Trump stand to profit too, everyone who never cared before, suddenly care.
3623 2018-11-21 20:22:38 Except for those of us with oil shares. 
3624 2018-11-21 20:22:28 Let me get this straight, you are letting Saudi Arabia get away with the murder of an American so that oil prices will get lowered, is that correct?  You numb nuts!!  You are not MAGA, you cheat, lie and steal your way through your way through life.
3625 2018-11-21 20:22:24 Get a clue. What happens to Israel and entire ME if we get in fight with Saudis? P.S. We are now exporting oil and gas. What happened to being energy independent and resulting price stabilization. Heard this 4 yrs as reason 4 opening Fed land to drilling.
3626 2018-11-21 20:22:22 Next time!x
3627 2018-11-21 20:22:22 They just signed a deal w/China that will make Saudi the #1 supplier to China, overtaking Russia.  Russia sells in CNY.  Seems unlikely at best that China (in midst of trade war) would increase their USD shortage by switching to Saudi oil unless KSA agreed to sell in CNY.
3628 2018-11-21 20:22:13 What a joke. Canadasells USA oil for $17.50 a barrel out of Alberta.
3629 2018-11-21 20:22:09 It’s also not true.  Saudis are pushing to limit oil production in December.  This will, in fact, raise gas prices.
3630 2018-11-21 20:22:02 If what my Saudi friends / clients are telling me is true...

It so much worse than business dealings and oil prices.

Much. Worse.
3631 2018-11-21 20:21:55 Too bad Jamal khashoggi can’t invest in oil
3632 2018-11-21 20:21:54 Trump admits he,
AND the Saudis,
are manipulating Oil Prices.
3633 2018-11-21 20:21:39 I  had a new shower fitted last week.
Two weeks earlier and i could have made you a cuppa tea.
3634 2018-11-21 20:21:36 The best thing can be we continue testing and gaining funds , take a steady approach to achieving cash wealth the predictions from most are these lower oil price benefits on shore long term and 2020 will see a shortfall in oil reserves just as we will be going to full production.
3635 2018-11-21 20:21:34 Niger/Delta oil is flowing like a river.
3636 2018-11-21 20:21:29 I’m doing a radio interview on how vetiver oil is tinctured from harvested tree bark.
3637 2018-11-21 20:21:29 Palm Oil is horrendous for the environment due to the massive deforestation associated with it. Good to see it suffering.
3638 2018-11-21 20:21:28 We don't for sure know the next step, but we expect that it goes something like this.

The oil is mixed with air, making a mixture that is very flammable.

This lowers the burning temperature for the oil, making it ignite.

Ignited oil falls down and ignites the rest of the oil.
3639 2018-11-21 20:21:25 Hi jo, I have an oil heater which also stopped working last night. Only the fan works on it now and it's not very old ! Not happy with it now.......
3640 2018-11-21 20:21:24 “Push Prince Mohammed too far, he suggested, and Saudi Arabia could cut oil production — leading to oil prices of $150 a barrel”, so much for energy independence . Maybe if we had solar panels they would try and cover the sun.
3641 2018-11-21 20:21:20 Trump: Our business interests are much more important than human rights. What's a dismembered body or so, against oil? Not much.
3642 2018-11-21 20:21:15 《オリーブ油豆知識》

3643 2018-11-21 20:21:15 *puts vape juice in essential oil diffuser*
3644 2018-11-21 20:21:12 Of course Saudi Arabia supplies around 11% of imported oil to the US, as opposed to 40% supplied by Canada. But as long as they keep killing reporters, I'm sure you'll keep patting them on the back.
3645 2018-11-21 20:21:12 Agreements with real power. 50% of the planet needs to be a natural preserve. First world countries helping third world to transition to renewables. Meaningful tax and penalties for companies destroying forests for palm oil and other products
3646 2018-11-21 20:21:06 So why the fear of Saudis cutting off oil? Doesn't make sense.
3647 2018-11-21 20:20:58 3/ is it possible that this has been a set up to attack the crown prince and his reform plans for moving away from oil dependence? Could be! The point is there are malicious Saudi dissidents and traitors all around the world, Saudis never killed any. Not even once!
3648 2018-11-21 20:20:46 Lol are you aware of what's actually happening? Why are you trying to lure people that the drop of $oil is a good think?
3649 2018-11-21 20:20:44 Lmaooo I dunno oo
3650 2018-11-21 20:20:39 Okay America listen up. I need Black Friday deals on tuition, oil changes, and chic fil a make it happen pls & thx
3651 2018-11-21 20:20:34 Changed the oil in the ol Mazda and got my new drilled rotors in the mail today 
3652 2018-11-21 20:20:32 No matter how old I get or how far I go, I’ll recognize the smell of the Amber White oil anywhere
3653 2018-11-21 20:20:31 Oil prices got lower than that under Obama and he didn't have to enter into ethical violations with Saudi Arabia to do it!  You'll never be as good as him and it eats you up inside doesn't it you disgusting meat sack.
3654 2018-11-21 20:20:23 Old enough to rember 60K job losses in US oilfield from Saudi war on US oil production starting in 2014.  

And whatever happened to US energy independence anyway?
3655 2018-11-21 20:20:22 You're really not all that intellectual despite your opinion of yourself. Your definition here is entirely subjective. Who decides? 
You think you drew a clear distinction, but really just depends on which end of the sword you're on.
3656 2018-11-21 20:20:21 I understand realpolitics and why saudis were a needed ally before shale (and other tech developments). I understand not breaking off abruptly because oil is still significant. But wtf is this signaling for a journalist after they financed radical Islamic terror and so on.
3657 2018-11-21 20:20:21 O.b.o will not disappoint like Amaka am sure one of those phones will be mine .
3658 2018-11-21 20:20:16 So oil prices aren't down because @realDonaldTrump publicly jerked off some Saudi murderers?
3659 2018-11-21 20:20:08 Sure it is.  If #SaudiArabia decided to stop using the $USD to price oil, that would be a security concern.  Kind of why we finally went and got Saddam.  Not the WMDs, he wanted to price #oil in Euros... a year or two later; dead and toppled. Not a coincidence.
3660 2018-11-21 20:20:06 Low oil prices aren’t good for the economy, I thought you were a businessman?
3661 2018-11-21 20:20:06 Oil over murder I think you’re related to putin . Nice roll model for baron
3662 2018-11-21 20:20:06 The same Saudi Arabia that started the oil embargo decades ago to raise the price of a gallon of gas  from 30 cents a gallon to over $1.00 a gallon and prices kept rising from then on?  The same Saudi Arabia that produced the 9-11 killers?  No thanks!
3663 2018-11-21 20:19:56 Bro. you should place the blame on the lazy Nigerian govt. that is oil dependent.
3664 2018-11-21 20:19:54 We get most of our oil from Canada not Saudi Arabia. He should be thanking @JustinTrudeau
3665 2018-11-21 20:19:53 Does this have anything to do with the #KashoggiCoverup? Oil dependency is nothing to celebrate. Time to move forward with renewable fuels and cut the strings op OPEC dependency.
3666 2018-11-21 20:19:52 Right. You do keep going lower. How about the fact that the US is energy independent and that Iranian oil is on the market helps the price down?
3667 2018-11-21 20:19:51 You should ask Saudi Arabia, who they would like to kill next, for the reduction of the Oil prize for $20.....perhaps you can make a good deal?
3668 2018-11-21 20:19:47 argon oil
3669 2018-11-21 20:19:41 Trump trade policy: murdered journalists and thousands of Yemeni for cheap oil.
3670 2018-11-21 20:19:41 Saudi Arabia only contributes 11% of our oil imports. Canada supplies 40%. I’d rather pay an extra cent or two for oil not supplied by a prince who kills people who try to expose corruption.
3671 2018-11-21 20:19:33 Since 2001, we have decreased our oil imports from Saudi by like 30%. It is not the same energy situation as when GW Bush was fellating the Saudi King. Just like everything else, Trump is stuck in the past when his brain was working correctly.
3672 2018-11-21 20:19:33 All the APC supporters that kept saying they’re voting Buhari so that OBJ will lose his oil block can now find another flimsy reason
3673 2018-11-21 20:19:33 Man gast oil the pan before frying the eggs y'all
3674 2018-11-21 20:19:27 テーブルに漫画が積んであるのでこれを読みたかったんだなという意思は伝わった
3675 2018-11-21 20:19:24 Who gives a s**t about the cost of oil...f**k the KSA....
3676 2018-11-21 20:19:24 The oil is very hot (way way over 100 degrees celcius).

The frozen turkey contains frozen water, which due to the heat of the oil is instantly sent boiling.

So it bubbles out, but because it happens so rapidly, the oil is also lifted out along with the bubbles.
3677 2018-11-21 20:19:20 Honestly, we have always turned a blind eye to Saudi abuses. Religious intolerance, women's rights, beheadings, anti-Israel, Yemen, murder, etc.,etc. Oil, money, military bases, location, etc. has always trumped our moral hypocritical outrage.This is just another example.
3678 2018-11-21 20:19:17 It’s not hard to understand when you remember trUMP doesn’t care who gets chopped. It’s about the almighty OIL thing as much as weapons. America is still dependent on Saudi oil. If gas is high at pumps, Repubs scream 
3679 2018-11-21 20:19:12 No, it’s only 30-40mins in a turkey deep fryer with peanut oil. Simple
3680 2018-11-21 20:19:09 You did know that oil prices are falling didn't you?  #IdiotInChief can't put the pieces of the puzzel together.  I hope you pay dearly for your transgressions on American soil & to Americans.
3681 2018-11-21 20:19:03 You do understand that if oil goes too low, it undermines our own oil industry. Saudi Arabia can produce oil far cheaper than we can. So, effectively, low oil prices are like a tariff on our oil producers. Saudi Arabia First!
3682 2018-11-21 20:18:57 みんなオイルが好きだよね⁇あん⁇嫌い⁇嫌いとか言うならオイル使われてる食品も製品も食べるなよ使うなよwwwwww? ガソリンもオイルだよ⁇www 車も乗るなよwww? 野菜だけ食ってろよwwww ベジタリアンテラワロスwwwwwww
3683 2018-11-21 20:18:53 We get 10-12 % from Saudis. 40% of our oil comes from Canada.
3684 2018-11-21 20:18:51 Cheap oil out of Alpha Draconis too! #ALPHADRACONISFIRST

3687 2018-11-21 20:18:45 How bout those exemptions for oil companies from the Iran sanctions that you supposedly re-imposed.  You really have no principles, do you.

Cut broccoli into bite size pieces
Place on baking tray and put into pre heated oven for 20 minutes at 160
When broccoli has cooled put in blender and whizz it up with some oil until it is a smooth sauce
Flush down the toilet

3690 2018-11-21 20:18:24 I think that the explosion of oil and gas extraction also helped a little bit.
3691 2018-11-21 20:18:17 Yea but how much oil do we import from the Saudi Arabia? Not that much. It’s about defense spending. They by a lot of arms from us. Also Trumps desire to build hotels keeps him from coming down on the kingdom. It’s all about money!
3692 2018-11-21 20:18:14 Seems to me oil and gas industry would be most likely industries to hire you?
3693 2018-11-21 20:18:09 well i did.
3694 2018-11-21 20:18:08 You realize that $54/barrel is stalling your own oil producers don’t you?  I thought you wanted all American business to thrive.
3695 2018-11-21 20:17:57 Tea tree oil and also Jojoba oils bro thank me later I promise you lol
3696 2018-11-21 20:17:53 So long as the oil is cheaper then killing a journalist is OK. Very Trump when u consider his relationship with news media. Sic.
3697 2018-11-21 20:17:50 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
3698 2018-11-21 20:17:50 I'm also a vegan because I care about animals, I don't go around spreading fake news on palm oil. @MarkMacpheeRFC does research in the rainforests and will confirm your making up bullshit
3699 2018-11-21 20:17:48 Yeah, pretty much.... blood for oil!!!
3700 2018-11-21 20:17:39 Aside from the disgustingness of this tweet a day after you decided to ignore the murder, Canada provides almost 4 times the oil SA does to the US. Maybe if we started killing people you don’t like, you’d acknowledge that
3701 2018-11-21 20:17:37 God my eyes,

3704 2018-11-21 20:17:18 @realDonaldTrump believes the lives of journalists are worth less than a better oil price.
3705 2018-11-21 20:17:13 Ladies  make sure you're not using soap in your Yoni!!! Peppermint oil &  
Coconut oil or Tea Tree oil & Coconut oil #yoni
3706 2018-11-21 20:17:09 I hate getting things like oil changes but fuck, they gotta be done.
3707 2018-11-21 20:17:08 #ThingsYouWISHYouCouldSayAtThanksgiving  Uncle Tom, if your hand goes any further down your pants, I'm afraid you'll strike OIL.
3708 2018-11-21 20:17:08 Soy sauce (just a dash), Salt, pepper, oil and ground coriander. Put some carrots, onions and garlic in the marinate as well.
3709 2018-11-21 20:17:06 Jesus
3710 2018-11-21 20:17:04 Once again the American people have been schooled. Silly me I thought we got most of our oil from Canada. Sure glad you cleared that up.  And thanking a murderous regime... Your the best
3711 2018-11-21 20:17:03 We should embargo all need Saudi oil!  #Tesla anyone?
3712 2018-11-21 20:17:02 お風呂上がって椅子に座ってからの記憶が無い(寝落ち)
3713 2018-11-21 20:17:01 a very good question.....history has shown us thing change and develop all the time but one thing will happen is that oil will come to end one time
3714 2018-11-21 20:16:56 she is a corporate dem, nothing that protects or cares for the people comes from her  or her votes.. she stands with wall street, fracking, oil company's and a huge listing of health care, insurance, doctors, health organization, and the people are left to wander aimlessly
3715 2018-11-21 20:16:56 Yay! Let's trade human rights for oil. It's a win win right?
3716 2018-11-21 20:16:45 Why President Trump is thanking Saudi Arabia and not Canada for cheap oil? It is simply b/c Saudi Arabia is unaccountable monarchy that wastes their resources to stay in power and Canada is accountable democracy and Mr. Trump likes unaccountable dictatorships to satisfy his ego.
3717 2018-11-21 20:16:39 Nymex Settles 11/21/18 - CL Jan19: 54.63 (+1.20) (-3.2% vs Last Week) #nymex #wti #oil
3718 2018-11-21 20:16:37 While there are many 20 to 40 year olds in Europe understanding how to live sustainably, it seems their own parents are consuming goods and services that are in direct opposition to the SDG, as is consuming industrial produced meat, dairy products and palm oil products, etc...
3719 2018-11-21 20:16:34 Oil apparently is thicker than blood.

3722 2018-11-21 20:16:28 We import@40% of our Oil from Canada and only 11% from Saudi Arabia so how@are they lowering our gas prices
3723 2018-11-21 20:16:21 So that was the deal? You let them kill and dismember an American and, in return, they lower the oil prices?

Nothing like having a soulless businessman in the White House.
3724 2018-11-21 20:16:19 Oil has dropped due to a slowing global economy and Saudi Arabia is pushing OPEC to cut production in order to raise prices. But the President is in his fantasy realm where all is good.

3726 2018-11-21 20:16:18 I cut up some beef slices(autodeplete added the words hard candies after slices for some reason. We must be colliding with parallel universes again) , and fried those in toasted sesame seed oil,  liberal amounts of salt and pepper added, and served on a slice of bread
3727 2018-11-21 20:16:15 I'm partial to roasting with olive oil and generous salt & pepper, then toss with balsamic vinegar.  Yuummm.
3728 2018-11-21 20:16:01 But, hey, what’s one violently murdered journalist compared to Trump’s Saudi oil deal that lowers our gas prices so we can expel more carbon into the already damaged air?
3729 2018-11-21 20:16:00 The current price for Heating Oil is $2.429 per gallon.
3730 2018-11-21 20:15:59 By the way, Mr. Wall, “ethical oil” was a marketing effort designed to further Canadian dependency on the US market. It’s not such a good idea now, right? Nor was “no-brainer” and “We won’t take no for an answer”. Conservatives have a problem with amnesia.
3731 2018-11-21 20:15:56 Please thank Canada for supplying 40% of our oil, not incubating terrorists who attack our shores, and not killing and dismembering US journalists.
3732 2018-11-21 20:15:56 Also in large part because so many exemptions to Iranian oil sanctions
3733 2018-11-21 20:15:55 how can oil sell for an average of $72 per barrel—as it has done so far in 2018—and we still cannot fund our budget?..Oil price is low, we are in trouble.Oil price is high, we are in trouble. Oil price is between high and low, we are in trouble. What then is the problem? Simon K.
3734 2018-11-21 20:15:54 So, sustainable or not, palm oil is useless in our products is that right? I get my big shop tomorrow and I'm keen to check it once delivered to see how much of what I buy has it in
3735 2018-11-21 20:15:54 The United States imports Canadian crude and resells it. Look at the price difference between WTI crude and Canadian crude and since Canada has a difficult time getting the oil out of Alberta, the US is making a killing reselling Canadian crude. Simple finance Diane. just my .02
3736 2018-11-21 20:15:53 Probably no mention that more of our oil comes from Canada than SA though?   Of course not, the only thing that matters to trump is that he is lining his pockets with SA $$!!
3737 2018-11-21 20:15:53 So Beezlebaboon, is Mr Khashoggi's life the price you paid the Saudi prince for lower oil barrel prices? $82 per barrel down $54. Is that how you make America great? Your not a president, your a MOB BOSS!
3738 2018-11-21 20:15:48 Is there an alternative to Palm Oil you can use?
3739 2018-11-21 20:15:44 Man, imagine how cheap oil will get when Saudi Arabia starts murdering CNN and MSNBC journalists.

3741 2018-11-21 20:15:35 #TrumpCrimeFamily are protecting their own assets they receive from these countries.  Today it was about the oil..a few weeks ago it was about the weapons.  @realDonaldTrump could care less about you and I & its delusional to think otherwise.  He is a fraud #WakeUpAmerica
3742 2018-11-21 20:15:34 @FoxNews @ShepNewsTeam Shep has deep hatred for DJT, President Trump was thanking Saudi for helping to lower oil prices. SSmith says that is stupid, as Saudi has nothing to do with USA prices. I think he skipped a couple of Economic classes.Dumb.
3743 2018-11-21 20:15:28 just put sea water in Lao's oil. now we wait.
3744 2018-11-21 20:15:23 We sport more oil than we need.  Don’t need their oil. Stop lying and do some research.  How dumb are you?
3745 2018-11-21 20:15:19 Tip for reusing jars (or rlly anything gooey/sticky) - mix 1 part coconut oil & 1 part baking soda to make a paste, spread paste on gooey part of jar from peeling off label, leave for 15-20min. before washing off! I’ve also heard canola oil works the same 
3746 2018-11-21 20:15:07 condoning murderer over a lower oil price is so fucked up it’s not even conceivable -except he actually is saying and doing it -as usual does what he wants to do-got to stop this before it’s too late!!
3747 2018-11-21 20:15:03 What a day of extreme emotions. Triumph and failure. Literal life and death. Gain and loss. My heart is a swirling pool in a tempest of oil and water. I need to talk or write or I might just burst and I’m not sure if that would be literal or figurative

3749 2018-11-21 20:15:00 we want to repeal and replace fossil fuel. we want the government to pay the workers who build oil rigs to instead tear them down and build glinting solar farms in their place #GreenNewDeal
3750 2018-11-21 20:14:54 Right. Why not have it your way and just hand the free world's strategic oil reserves to Iran?  Fool.
3751 2018-11-21 20:14:52 What is their reasoning behind that assinine policy? Oil money in political campaigns?
3752 2018-11-21 20:14:51 うーいひゃー！
3753 2018-11-21 20:14:44 How is that feudalism? I don't recall feudalism having anything to do with governments subsidizing industries. If you would care to elaborate that'd be nice. Also what's funny is this both sides thing is being pushed by the oil lobby. They would like to have it your way too
3754 2018-11-21 20:14:38 Funny how legalizing Cannabis could rival two issues, BIG PHARMA AND BIG OIL. Yet everyone wants to bow to an imaginary coin. Kinda how Diamonds are worth absolutely nothing yet cost a fortune. Tell me everyone, do we really want resolve? Failure and catastrophe are big business.
3755 2018-11-21 20:14:37 Natural gas is on the side and already accounts for 1/3 of energy. Oil and coal combined are at 1/3.  Qatar sanctions are because of this.
3756 2018-11-21 20:14:34 Does that mean there will be a backlash against white people  for using sun tanning beds, sprays or suntan oil?
3757 2018-11-21 20:14:34 Dear @realDonaldTrump there are countries that depend on oil and lowering oil prices will seriously affect their economy. The world is bigger than america you know 
3758 2018-11-21 20:14:33 Especially considering the fact that it's increased domestic  oil production being raised that's causing the down turning prices
3759 2018-11-21 20:14:25 Norway is also pushing hard to drill oil in fragile marine systems, far away from these forests @AusConservation @GreenpeaceAP
#savethebight
3760 2018-11-21 20:14:23 We talking oil or stocks?
3761 2018-11-21 20:14:17 Won't be taking any oil positions yet, Trump wants lower prices I'm sure he'll find a way to push them lower.
3762 2018-11-21 20:14:14 Better oil prices=one journalist tortured and slaughtered. You are just a scumbag.
3763 2018-11-21 20:14:14 Besides, we are self-supported in the fossil fuel industry. We don't need Saudi Arabia's oil.
3764 2018-11-21 20:14:12 P.S. the demented does not control the price of oil either, no matter how often he says it!!

3768 2018-11-21 20:14:00 Oil prices are down short term because worldwide production has exceeded consumption. It’s temporary and the Saudis only account for a portion. We have an imbecile for POTUS
3769 2018-11-21 20:13:57 Friend, the regulations that were ‘stifling the economy’ lost in the last few years protected your right to be here using the Internet, made sure our parks don’t become oil fields, and helped keep that nice air you’re breathing clean. Tell me you or me are better off. Please.
3770 2018-11-21 20:13:49 oooops wait oil reserves work for the Arabs why is that not the case with our mining 
3771 2018-11-21 20:13:43 Hi there! We use canola oil for frying and olive oil and canola oil for salads and sauces.
3772 2018-11-21 20:13:41 But hey, Trump got Saudi oil prices lowered. I mean what’s one violently murdered journalist compared to cheaper gas so we can drive more and add to carbon emissions?
3773 2018-11-21 20:13:38 We get about 10% of our oil from SA. We are no longer highly dependent on Middle East oil. Most comes from the US, Canada, Mexico, Norway. That 9% we get from SA could be made up. SA is unlikely to just stop production, but we could stop buying.
3774 2018-11-21 20:13:38 “Oil first” is what you meant to say. Oil over all else. Oil plus whatever amount of $ you personally receive from the saudis, first. That’s what you meant to say! America is not a part of that equation.We the people are not involved in that. Just you & the trash surrounding you.
3775 2018-11-21 20:13:33 I swallowed a few drops of frankincense oil and noticed upwellings of gas that escaped me that tasted like frankincense for some reason. I took a bath and that's when I started playing the 1812 Overture out my equitorial tuba. All that made my headache weaken
3776 2018-11-21 20:13:32 I agree with that. I just used to live in a town that was driven by oil and a lot of people wanted you to feel bad about yourself if you wanted low gas prices because they took it as an attack on their livelihood.
3777 2018-11-21 20:13:30 Not so good for the American oil companies though. Didn't think of that did ya?
3778 2018-11-21 20:13:28 What’s the magic number of Dead Journalist Hall Passes we would have to issue for them to actually pay us to take their oil? If our values are for sale, I’d like to know our asking price.

3781 2018-11-21 20:13:00 As someone who majored in International Security and has campaigned on us getting off of oil for literally my entire career—the Saudi government is awful.
3782 2018-11-21 20:12:59 Don’t forget peppermint oil for your Boyne Eyes this Christmas Show season!
3783 2018-11-21 20:12:56 Though it's obvious that as their economy transitions away from oil, countries that were originally totally cowed by them seem to be developing a back bone. I wouldn't be surprised if they murdered him to prove their power hadn't waned.
3784 2018-11-21 20:12:52 No Bette.. it is straight up one reason only.. he is very simple..MONEY. that is all. not oil..not arms..those are a means to the end with trump..MONEY is all he understands.. his money
3785 2018-11-21 20:12:49 1. The last time WTI Crude Oil was above $80 a barrel was in October of 2014.
2. WTI Crude was $47.51 a barrel on June 1st 2017.  That means it has increased over the past 18 months.

3788 2018-11-21 20:12:40 The price of oil was $36 the last month of Obama’s Presidency.
3789 2018-11-21 20:12:35 Support Aussie renewable tech!!  And don’t forget EVs. Oil imports for transport can be reduced by fueling our fleet with solar powered cars. EV batteries charged in the middle of the day can also store energy for night time use. #fairdinkumpower
3790 2018-11-21 20:12:34 My busband is a retired petroleum geologist.  Low oil prices hurt US oil industry employees.

3792 2018-11-21 20:12:29 India imported 156,767 MT of sunflower oil in October vs. 149,930 MT in  September and vs. 128,791 MT a year ago. India's Nov-Oct 2017/18 imports  at 2.525 MMT vs. 2.169 MT a year ago - Agrochart
3793 2018-11-21 20:12:28 That was painless. And was able to make it out with paying for just the oil change. That's a success to me.

3796 2018-11-21 20:12:23 We only get around 11% of oil from Saudi Arabia. He actually meant to thank them for the bailout of Jared Kushner. He could care less about the rest of the country.
3797 2018-11-21 20:12:03 Oil prices go too low, has effect on the petroleum industry.  Lay-off, reduction in drilling, etc.
Everything in moderation.
3798 2018-11-21 20:12:02 Only because I have these free oil changes or else I’d do them myself #stillwaiting
3799 2018-11-21 20:12:00 So the Saudis need $100/barrel to balance its federal budget thanks to its new federal welfare program.  Anyone want to do the math and figure out how much oil needs to be in order for the US to balance it’s budget?
3800 2018-11-21 20:12:00 LREM dit le gas oil pollue on le taxe !! Pourquoi taxez vous l'essence ?
3801 2018-11-21 20:12:00 "Thank you, Saudi Arabia, for the oil that you (so generously) priced at literal human expense, in exchange for the assurance that I, a draft-dodging tax fraud, and my spineless government hacks, will turn a blind eye. Let's go lower!!!"
3802 2018-11-21 20:11:58 I used buttermilk & then Italian bread crumbs on top, drizzled with olive oil. Super simple but really tasty.

3809 2018-11-21 20:11:35 Thank you Saudi Arabia?  Are you saying that they make the oil prices and not the market.  
3810 2018-11-21 20:11:32 No palm oil because orangutans are losing their lives and homes, yet you don’t mind other beings doing the same?  stinks of #Speciesism to me and very hypocritical.  Do you realise the damage animal agriculture is doing to the planet? #Vegan #LKPreachyVegan
3811 2018-11-21 20:11:31 Mafia + oil = Saudi
3812 2018-11-21 20:11:26 The only thing low is him .. he’s a low life (ps SA is only responsible for 11% of our oil imports- thank Canada  would be more appropriate)
3813 2018-11-21 20:11:15 Another waste of tax$. They are anti oil and gas guys. Can’t  make this shit up  Notley has to go!
3814 2018-11-21 20:11:14 
3815 2018-11-21 20:11:13 I am even more appalled by our support for the tragedy of Yemen.  Why do we continue in this atrocity?  40% of our oil comes from Canada.  Not Saudi Arabia.  But I guess they support our own military shenanigans so --no problem.
3816 2018-11-21 20:11:07 I’d recommend an engine flush and oil change.
And change you mokalic maybe? (S)he might be slipping the automobile Spanish fly/Viagra equivalent .
3817 2018-11-21 20:11:06 Taking mine from the freezer to boiling hot oil. Let’s do this!
3818 2018-11-21 20:11:01 How far back should we go? 1990: first mass US troop deployment in SA. Not a good idea. 1993, 2001 TT BLASTS. Peddling arms/cronyism to ME for decades. America just doesn’t belong in the ME. Let Russia have it, its problems. But...oil monguering.
3819 2018-11-21 20:10:57 coconut oil masks
3820 2018-11-21 20:10:56 F**k me! $2.62/gallon?????

In the UK it's about $9/gallon.

WTF are you all moaning about???

Approx 225 gals heating oil which lasts about 3 1/2 months, costs about $900.

You don't know you're born in the US.
3821 2018-11-21 20:10:55 I absolutely despise taking my car for an oil change. Weird, I know, but it’s true. Girls should never have to do this. It’s a mans job, plain and simple. #throwingatantrum #donttalktomeimmad
3822 2018-11-21 20:10:53 PM- same procedure, only difference I apply tissue oil on my body.......face scrub atleast thrice a week...
3823 2018-11-21 20:10:41 I love roasted plantain, roasted yam, fish with palm oil stew. Sweetest thing about uyo. Afang, white soup and edikang taste delicious. I love periwinkle. Suck em out
3824 2018-11-21 20:10:38 What I find depressing is to see so many vegans shutting down a conversation over palm oil without trying to understand why so many environmentalists are defending a boycott. How can someone who defends animals be indifferent to the images of orangutans suffering?
3825 2018-11-21 20:10:30 I'd just trade with Iran. they have a lot of oil.
3826 2018-11-21 20:10:25 GEJ still never get sense, he forgot to mention that his govt started  borrowing in February to pay salaries because of dwindling oil revenue and reckless spending.
3827 2018-11-21 20:10:21 I smell so nice. Thanks oil & Apple cider vinegar. Now, my make my hair nice!!
3828 2018-11-21 20:10:19 …むにゃ…ぐぅ(エルザちゃんに寄りかかる
3829 2018-11-21 20:10:15 I’m too smart for your very poorly conceived attempt at what amounts to “NO, YOU ARE!” Face it buddy, you lost this argument. Really, really, badly and very publicly. Now back home with you to lick your wounds and lose another debate another day. I haven’t got more time for you.
3830 2018-11-21 20:10:13 She sure is! Canada supplies far more oil to the U.S. than Saudi Arabia (I retweeted something about that earlier), but I suppose humper is obivious to that. He's obvious to so many things, it's hard to say what he actually 'knows'.
3831 2018-11-21 20:10:07 Need to END any and all oil purchasing from Saudi Arabia!  Full Stop!
3832 2018-11-21 20:10:04 Donald Trump has just tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to 'a big Tax Cut for America and the World!' In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
3833 2018-11-21 20:10:04 I hear we get 9% of our oil from Saudi Arabia and 20% from Canada!? Why are you kissing their behind? Could it have to do w your personal financial interests?
3834 2018-11-21 20:10:03 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。
3835 2018-11-21 20:10:02 Better to pay more for oil than deal with a foreign government that is allowed to kill American citizens.
3836 2018-11-21 20:09:58 I know the Bush's have interest in oil , Obama said Hillary laundered money.
3837 2018-11-21 20:09:48 He’s not worried about the price of oil. He’s worried about his own personal wealth and no doubt the many ways he is beholden to the Saudis.  Please take action.
3838 2018-11-21 20:09:44 Toss up but since our dollar is based on oil prices I'd say Saudi Arabia.
3839 2018-11-21 20:09:37 Given that our oil is being sold $30/bbl less than WTI not surprised you are buying it!
3840 2018-11-21 20:09:33 Highly possible. And after today's so called friendly talk by US about Saudi, it will be extremely critical for US since all the positions are in a gridlock situation. Same thing with India. Buying S400 from RU and oil from Iran in Rupees and yet no acn taken. Check mate moves
3841 2018-11-21 20:09:30 Hug your kids because God knows who will be sold for a cheaper barrel of oil next.
3842 2018-11-21 20:09:24 Even without oil, Scotland is totally viable.
ANY oil is a bonus.
And this proves there is still a very mega bonus out there.
An independent Scotland would already be in Norway's position financially.
With the right decision, we still could be.
3843 2018-11-21 20:09:09 Oil prices being low it's not just your personal car. Companies use it to transport good across this country. Small buissness benefit low prices at the pump.
3844 2018-11-21 20:09:06 The oil is not even for the East, it's for the South-South, stop claiming what's not yours!
3845 2018-11-21 20:09:04 I bet her boyfriend got a surprise the first time she checked his oil.
3846 2018-11-21 20:09:00 Thank you Saudi Arabia for brutally murdering then cutting into pieces a journalist for an American newspaper. Oil prices are a smidge lower so that makes up for everything.
3847 2018-11-21 20:09:00 TNK solo pesaba el 0,13% a cierre de trimestre.. si sumas la participacion de TK ahi si q es mas pero poca cosa. Aunque tienen otras compañias con exposicion a los fletes de los oil tankers.
La tesis de TK y TGP la comparto. Buen momento para aportar a Cobas imo @CasildaValue
3848 2018-11-21 20:08:46 You’re he one who started talking about nationalism. You’re the one who attempted to say that even though I’m right, it’s somehow unrelated. The meandering train of thought that brought us to topics like “the definition of nationalism” was yours.
3849 2018-11-21 20:08:44 For NOT judging Saudi Arabia of murdering a journalist you praise cheaper Oil. Shame on you
3850 2018-11-21 20:08:43 So if you use some common sense and don’t fill the fryer to the top with oil it won’t overflow and ignite. If you also don’t drop in a frozen turkey it won’t go explosive, then boil over and then ignite. Basically don’t be a moron and this won’t happen to you.
3851 2018-11-21 20:08:38 Why not colonize SA and take their oil
3852 2018-11-21 20:08:37 Drop in global oil prices or the local price in Alberta? 
Because for over a year now global prices have been recovering, while locally then have gotten worse.
Operating a severe deficit while providing no tangible plans to protect the local energy industry creates debt.
3853 2018-11-21 20:08:36 Saudis kidnap, dismember, and murder journalist Jamal Khashoggi of the Washington Post.
Orange Hitler tweets, “Oil prices getting lower… Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let’s go lower!”
Sorry, Mr. Trump, but nobody can go lower than you.
Nobody.

3855 2018-11-21 20:08:28 @QuornFoods palm oil in all your products... Please stop this!
3856 2018-11-21 20:08:24 Am I the only one who thinks shitto tastes like chilli oil?
3857 2018-11-21 20:08:24 "Time had been eaten by the oil palm. Then I saw that some of the sawit trees surrounding us were not oil palm trees at all, but soldiers. You see, sawit is like the military: patches of black and green. It kills people. It is powerful. It is Indonesian, not Papuan. It eats us."
3858 2018-11-21 20:08:20 The quick & easy profit business planning/execution/management practices are Canada wide problem, but far more visible in AB in past 3+ decades of intense oil focus. Investing in innovation & diversification anathema in this country apart from a few niches (tech, craft beer, etc)
3859 2018-11-21 20:08:17 Fuck your oil change. Suck my DICK
3860 2018-11-21 20:08:09 He wouldn’t care if it was @BretBaier or the other guy that calls him out all the time. Now, if it were @JudgeJeanine we would nuke their asses. And steal their oil.
3861 2018-11-21 20:07:56 Saudis have some killer oil prices
3862 2018-11-21 20:07:55 The oil price just dropped bellow $54 a barril yesterday. How come you state “com o petróleo em alta???”. #FAKEREPOTING
3863 2018-11-21 20:07:52 "For me, very simple, America first. Saudi, if we broke w/them, your oil prices would go through the roof" - @realDonaldTrump justifying his Saudi love even though they murdered a reporter. Yet U.S. imported only 15% of its oil & petroleum products first eight months of 2018.
3864 2018-11-21 20:07:50 When I get abs don't tell me I looked good either way, you a got damn lie rub some baby oil on this chiseled chest!  #Abernacles
3865 2018-11-21 20:07:46 It probably does.  Texas has the most corrupt government of all the 50 states.  Corrupted by Petrochemical companies since the discovery of oil.  Everything that we are dealing with now is due to Texas and Russia partnering.
3866 2018-11-21 20:07:42 Broccoli three ways on @MasterChefUK looks a masterclass in how to make broccoli go as far away from being broccoli as possible. Take a healthy veg, add cheese, cream, oil, deep fry, butter, more cheese and wallop. Same healthy vegetable tasting exactly the same.
3867 2018-11-21 20:07:40 No they are clear sign that America is producing more oil
3868 2018-11-21 20:07:39 I bet oil could go down to $30 a barrel if they get to kill another journalist.
3869 2018-11-21 20:07:36 NOooo Jo, nightmare..... glad I booked the boiler man for check up, failing that I’ve got an oil fired heater and electric blanket lol. Hope you get all sorted ASAP hun x
3870 2018-11-21 20:07:34 I literally have done none of those things. I was asked to provide proof of voter suppression. I did so. I didn’t say only one party has ever done it, in fact I didn’t even argue with you that that was true. I have stuck to my point this entire time.
3871 2018-11-21 20:07:31 Make it thick!   Cover it and the ground in oil!
3872 2018-11-21 20:07:29 doing a cbd oil face mask & a cbd oil body mask & also sleeping on my back patio for the night. Now does anyone have any questions
3873 2018-11-21 20:07:29 Trump bowing down to Saudi Arabia after they admitted to killing a journalist was incredibly weak and sad.
American presidents really need to stop worshiping an actual terrorist state just so they can keep getting cheap oil. Grow some backbone.
3874 2018-11-21 20:07:22 Tea tree oil ... changes lives
3875 2018-11-21 20:07:20 I see oil prices are dropping bigly! I wonder if the cartel in #portmacquarie will drop their pump price soon? @portmacnews
3876 2018-11-21 20:07:14 I’ve always said the Oilers are likely somewhere in the middle of the 16-17 team (103pts) and the 17-18 team (78 pts). The Oil are 10-10-1 right now with 21 pts. At this point last year they were 7-12-2 with 16. In 16-17 they were 12-8-1 with 25. So seems about right.
3877 2018-11-21 20:07:14 Can’t agree here! 
“... man shall not live by bread alone”
The one who deliberately kill the other shall be punished by the people @IntlCrimCourt #US Let’s ignore it, and create animosity/fear/danger
Let’s face oil price rise and learn. Perhaps, it’s good/right for peace on earth
3878 2018-11-21 20:07:01 Sautéed onion and mushrooms in coconut oil, made a roux with flour, brought up with veggie broth and some coconut milk. Added salt, freshly ground pepper, a dash of soy sauce and a generous sprinkle of nutritional yeast flakes. And, of course, some of the canned onion rings!
3879 2018-11-21 20:07:00 She has a name. Just has hoe-engine oil 
3880 2018-11-21 20:06:59 Don’t really trust essential oil people yet tbh
3881 2018-11-21 20:06:57 It will be some time before fracked products will be able to replace Russian and Saudi oil.
3882 2018-11-21 20:06:55 SHAME on Trump for giving credit for low oil prices to Saudis instead of to the American frackers who have revolutionized the industry!
3883 2018-11-21 20:06:51 パチやスロには使い捨てにされ埋もれていった有名声優さんの良曲がいっぱいあるのです...
3884 2018-11-21 20:06:51 Trump  turns a blind eye on Kashoggi killing ,since US interests come first not justice and human rights.If they lose Saudi Arabia ,oil trade will be in turmoi and demise of the dollar.
Secondly,Saudi is key importer of US military arms.
3885 2018-11-21 20:06:49 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Canada is the largest supplier of oil to US- so thank them instead of Saudi murderers!
3886 2018-11-21 20:06:47 The difference being that the price of oil is established globally with Canada being a price-taker. Interestingly, Texas is now screwing up OPEC’s former supply management latitude.
3887 2018-11-21 20:06:44 Our nation is in term oil. Because of this president.
3888 2018-11-21 20:06:39 The gas prices where I am have gone down lately. It was $2.33 a gallon when I got some last night. 
You know we only import 10% of our oil so when the news says gas prices rise due to something on the other side of the world it’s BS
3889 2018-11-21 20:06:38 How many weapons do we give them for this artificial low priced oil that kills others?$$$$$$
3890 2018-11-21 20:06:22 Put oil in your hair everyday when you get braids,EVERYDAY. Watch how long your new growth is
3891 2018-11-21 20:06:20 Imagine this happening to...@RepDianaDeGette @SenBennetCO @SenCoryGardner @JasonCrowCO6 ...this might happen to them on Wall St., a big pharma co., a defense contractor or an oil/gas co. #copolitics
3892 2018-11-21 20:06:20 genuine question:
I know you like to smoke weed, but what are your thoughts on CBD oil for anxiety? Is it not strong enough for you? I just started a regimen and I’m finding that it’s helpful, but your anxiety seems far more severe than mine, so I’m just curious
3893 2018-11-21 20:06:12 Nice hot shower or a hot towel on there for a few mins after applying a shave lotion or oil, softens the hair and opens the cuticles for a much smoother easier shave 
3894 2018-11-21 20:06:02 كتير أنواع سرطان ومنها حالات مستعصية عالطب تم علاجها عن طريق زيت الحشيش، أكتبو على جوجل cannabis oil for treating cancer في كتار تعالجو وشفو ومنهم أطفال حتى كان عندهم حالات صعبة نزلو ڤيديوهات عاليوتيوب وشرحو تجربتهم وكيف تم العلاج وحتى كيف ممكن ينعمل الزيت لو مش متوفر.
3895 2018-11-21 20:05:53 Yes mr trump you are celebrating law oil prices and the cost is mr kashougi’s life . His blood now is on your hands for backing up a killer shame on you and the precedent you are trying to set
3896 2018-11-21 20:05:50 im so fuckig annoyed dude they better not fucking say this is going to cost a couple of hundred when all it literally needed was an oil change
3897 2018-11-21 20:05:46 This is great news from BC Government. However, we will not be phasing out of gasoline and oil for at least 20 years. The incentives to switch to heatpumps commercial and residential is years away.Not many can afford a new car, many 2018 are gas only.This is a great start.
3898 2018-11-21 20:05:46 My body has been shaking since like dodo inside hot oil maybe because of #nbs @iamkissdaniel  About to kill everyone vibically
3899 2018-11-21 20:05:44 The U.S. imported only 15 percent of its oil and petroleum products during the first eight months of 2018.
3900 2018-11-21 20:05:37 President Bush and the bin Laden family have been connected through dubious business deals since 1977, when Salem, the head of the bin Laden family business, one of the biggest construction companies in the world, invested in Bush's start-up oil company, Arbusto Energy, Inc.
3901 2018-11-21 20:05:35 Meanwhile she does not mention that on the east coast of Canada ... The biggest oil spill has just occurred.....    I thought she was minister of the environment.... Not minister of plastic... Does she actually know her portfolio ?
3902 2018-11-21 20:05:31 Tell that to the thousand Americans who are working for  companies doing business with them.
Not just oil genius
3903 2018-11-21 20:05:30 The price for the get out of jail free card . You are a disgrace do you think that family cares about oil prices?  clearly you don't @guardian @nytimes @washingtonpost @CNN @ABC @FoxNews @PressSec
3904 2018-11-21 20:05:27 Guess what, Saudi Arabia is having trouble meeting its commitment to lift 1 million more barrels a day than they had. So what you ask? Oil is a finite commodity, the price will go up.
3905 2018-11-21 20:05:22 You ain’t down for some fish oil though
3906 2018-11-21 20:05:18 Saudi Arabia got a raw deal. In order to buy trump they had to spend billions in defense contracts, loan money to Jared, and increase oil production. 

Meanwhile, Putin owns trump and it only cost him a GoPro, a couple of escorts, and a set of new sheets.

#KashoggiMurder
3907 2018-11-21 20:05:15 Saudi Arabia is responsible for 11% of foreign oil in the US...
3908 2018-11-21 20:05:11 The price of oil is low because its been diluted with blood.
3909 2018-11-21 20:04:56 If we are exporting oil then we import no oil.
3910 2018-11-21 20:04:55 Wait unit they tell the MORON that Oil needs to be at 65 for companies to make money Fracking.
3911 2018-11-21 20:04:52 To be clear, I'm not thrilled with Trump's response. We slap Putin on the wrist when he kills people, and when the Saudi's do it we thank them for low oil prices. Diplomacy is complicated and often unpalatable.
3912 2018-11-21 20:04:47 tea tree oil!! But dilute it with water when applying it directly
3913 2018-11-21 20:04:45 I can’t speak for others, but I’ve wanted US policy regarding SA to change for some time. The US gets only 11% of its oil now from SA. 40% from Canada.
3914 2018-11-21 20:04:43 I came to get my oil changed in #Austin and met Scott Dilinger, a @USMC veteran. I was wearing my gifted @iava sweater, so naturally he came up to ask me if I was a veteran. I said no, but that I work with vets and have family in the military.
3915 2018-11-21 20:04:42 Saudi kills Yemen children, imprisons and tortures women, kills a journalist in bright day light and cuts his body to pieces, and you thank them for oil price? You bring shame to not only America but the whole world
3916 2018-11-21 20:04:40 Buy more oil from Canada, on no we are a threat to your national security so Trump will stick with the Saudi’s, he is in debt to them way to much
3917 2018-11-21 20:04:37 Yeah i am sure the Saud's are real happy Trump made the US the world's biggest oil producer.
3918 2018-11-21 20:04:31 I asked a clerk what exactly cannabis oil makes you feel like& this woman literally said "it doesn't make you feel any different" as if I was trying to get her to say it makes you high.I was like..Maam. I know it won't get me high but wtf is it supposed to do if you feel the same
3919 2018-11-21 20:04:30 Interesting. Apparently can trade murder for a better oil price.
3920 2018-11-21 20:04:20 U are a MONSTERSelling HUMAN RIGHTS & AMERICAN VALUES 4 OIL + Your OWN INTEREST 
3921 2018-11-21 20:04:20 Oil companies dropping drilling programs left, right and center.  Costing Albertans 1000's of jobs.  Tired of his act.  Notley stands by and let's it happen.   We are doomed.   #Trudeaumustgo
3922 2018-11-21 20:04:16 The US needs voices that won't quit talking about the evil of the Hous of Saud! I would rather walk than drive in convience of oil full of blood. 
Please notice that the US censors any pictures of chop chop square in Saudi Arabia. I saw images of this pure evil in Denmark.
3923 2018-11-21 20:04:10 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
3924 2018-11-21 20:04:09 Oh ..

Then I will oil and salt them and cook them 

Like those steak fries that are cooked just do good and a favorite .. 

mmmm
3925 2018-11-21 20:04:07 oil crisis, wasn't it? There were 2 in the 1970s. Global. New York went bankrupt. Very difficult time. Are you trying to say it was just labour's fault? haha excellent
3926 2018-11-21 20:04:05 Mine is like, "okay, I'm going to stream today!"

But then it's like "I should make dinner and clean and Christmas shop and finish this project and call my parents and paint this wall and change my car oil and solve world hunger"
3927 2018-11-21 20:04:04 And then praises them for cheap oil and following up with they could drop more in the marketplace...
3928 2018-11-21 20:04:03 Ah. How can I owe an oil and gas tycoon like you money? I’m finished niyen 
3929 2018-11-21 20:04:00 I wish I knew people irl who used oil paint bc I’m to scared to use it lmaoo
3930 2018-11-21 20:03:59 If it was up to Saudi Arabia the price of oil would be $150. Don't try to justify your pathetic coddling of murderous dictators by saying it saves money at the pump. You should cut your losses and resign now before Mueller wears you out.
3931 2018-11-21 20:03:50 Yes, the foundation stick has hydrogenated soya oil but other than that no allergens I've spotted. It's all made in house as well  how can you charge 10 dollars for a concealer foundation duo. I'm so mad 
3932 2018-11-21 20:03:49 We hear you. This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years.  We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
3933 2018-11-21 20:03:49 He doesn’t give one god damn about oil or arms. He’s standing by the saudis because they bailed him out of bankruptcies, purchases luxury apartments from him and he wants to maintain that same business partnership with them after he leaves office.
3934 2018-11-21 20:03:38 The assassins invested money in the US banks is going to instruct a safe land for them .
The Saudi Arabia and other Islamic countries' money and oil have changed the meaning of Human Rights to '' Right to kill the innocent and sinless Humans '' .
3935 2018-11-21 20:03:37 i took my car in for an oil change and now i won’t have my car for 3 weeks :-)
3936 2018-11-21 20:03:37 Be careful you dont go low enough to hurt domestic oil production.
3937 2018-11-21 20:03:35 Did I or did I not promise myself I would not become dependent on that stupid Sunday Riley face oil when I purchased the tester and yet here we are, repurchasing like the first class beg we all know I am
3938 2018-11-21 20:03:35 That's right: Thanks again Obama! (You guys should have a thank you card writing party for him.)

Hey, when are you gonna comment on the stock market plummet? Or the fact that your president badly lied today and got caught lying today about the price of oil? 

We're waiting...
3939 2018-11-21 20:03:34 We are not scared, but you are a phoney that really had NO clue. It is sad to hear you go completely off the rails day after day. The sad part is people buy your nonsense! You are a snake oil sales woman!
3940 2018-11-21 20:03:34 Oil has been saying dumb shit for years
3941 2018-11-21 20:03:31 Goya olive oil...
3942 2018-11-21 20:03:28 Why do you think roadways are made with blacktop and not concrete?

Oil Companies sell the scrapings so cheap. ( there is a lot of it)

Quick to lay out.

And it'll eventually break down within a decade (quicker if there is diesel spill), so they know they ALWAYS have a customer
3943 2018-11-21 20:03:22 And chop him up and boil him in oil.
3944 2018-11-21 20:03:17 I know its not for all,, me 142 lbs 63 full had of hair and on zero meds. I eat well a little meat lots of veggies and workout every day. I beat arthritic knees 5 years ago fish oil 
Zink + magnesium..
3945 2018-11-21 20:03:16 Oil prices Trump human lives. See what I did there? #fraudpresident
3946 2018-11-21 20:03:13 Rep Swallwell, this is not about oil, it’s about Trump’s personal investments in ME, specifically Trump hotels and golf courses. He could care less about the US economy or more importantly, about our moral leadership on the world stage.
3947 2018-11-21 20:03:13 Look back at Kobar towers what BC said. Just remember Saudis control OPEC oil cheap Russia no money oil high Russia rich. That's another reason we have kissed the kingdoms ass for so long.
3948 2018-11-21 20:03:12 Crashing the American economy will also bring down oil prices
3949 2018-11-21 20:03:05 Stop drilling for oil and burning it?
3950 2018-11-21 20:02:58 Note to self.  Replace oil with gasoline.
3951 2018-11-21 20:02:57 Oil is a world commodity, the parties that contribute to the US do not matter for the price. The price is based off the world supply and demand of oil. The Saudis are a huge supplier. Cutting their supply would cause a shortage, therefore raising prices. This stuff isn’t hard.
3952 2018-11-21 20:02:46 Pretty much... we have more oil than Saudi Arabia, you have no idea what the optimal temperature should be, California had wildfires & Texas had floods before we used fossil fuels... but yes blame Trump
3953 2018-11-21 20:02:42 sure once we classify putting palm oil in peanut butter as the felony it should be
3954 2018-11-21 20:02:36 You get 40% of your oil from us in Canada, only 11% from Saudi so explain again how that makes them your oil besties? Wait, it's not about oil at all is it, it's the money they're paying you to infiltrate North America and take control of gov't.
3955 2018-11-21 20:02:35 Yeah, I get a little more irritated when the shyster has a legitimate medical degree. I hope I never see one of my former students selling snake oil...
3956 2018-11-21 20:02:31 Brain without oil....  That one na brain...??  Lol
3957 2018-11-21 20:02:29 Oil prices? Bullsh%t. You just don't want to shut down the money spigot for the Trump and Kushner family syndicates.
3958 2018-11-21 20:02:29 I believe that Canada supplies 3 times as much oil to us than the Saudis Traitor in Chief is FOUL to our Northern Neighbours because they DO NOT spend MILLIONS at & in his Private Enterprises
3959 2018-11-21 20:02:24 Sustainable palm oil is absolute BS. STOP @CadburyUK STOP!!! You are destroying our planet with your lies and endless greed. Shameful. @HSIUKorg @HSIGlobal @CadburyWorld
3960 2018-11-21 20:02:24 Your Excellency, @elrufai, this was your position on @NNPCgroup barely 3 years ago, so, it came as a surprise when @APCNigeria supporters are criticising @OfficialPDPNig presidential candidate, @atiku sharing similar position and noting plan to partially privatized the oil firm
3961 2018-11-21 20:02:16 This i agree with but has been US practice for decades. Oil talks! Genocide in Yemen and US turns a blind eye. Journalist friend of Bin Laden killed and the outrage? Save it for cnn.
3962 2018-11-21 20:02:12 Of course they don’t. But they all invest in oil & gas and the arms companies on the stock markets. 
But we must all be good behave. We must protect the planet from doom  Start living buddy. 
By a flash fast motor and have some fun before it’s all gone. 
Or way to expensive.
3963 2018-11-21 20:02:12 I'm anti Trump, BUT. How much oil we import from Canada vs Saudia Arabia is irrelevant. If Saudi Arabia keeps pumping and supplying others, it drives Canadian export prices down.

The bigger takeaway is regardless of Saudi's oil influence we should not be for sale.
3964 2018-11-21 20:02:09 Great; we don’t use palm oil. But then what we use, other oils are even more damaging to the environment. We need to support sustainable sources of palm oil.
3965 2018-11-21 20:02:08 Get a new battery, now I need a oil change. This shit is never ending
3966 2018-11-21 20:02:06 Oil change 
3967 2018-11-21 20:02:06 OIL and $AAPL FADE into close
3968 2018-11-21 20:02:01 It will work with beeswax alone but if you add a little jojoba oil and pine resin it makes them more pliable and smell nicer.
3969 2018-11-21 20:01:59 Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia. Canada also didn't cause 911, or murder an American Journalist in the embassy. 
But I guess not enough Canadians spend money at your hotels.
3970 2018-11-21 20:01:56 Muslims in Muslim lands killing each other.  Not our problem.  
Losing 1/2 Trillion dollar contract & access to cheap oil, now that's OUR problem.
3971 2018-11-21 20:01:55 Good you protect your business, but how do you plan to protect nature and future of your children. Future of your children is not in palm oil, but in well being of nature. Without it we are all dead.  Look for solutions together with your European partners.
#NoPalmOil for now.
3972 2018-11-21 20:01:53 I wonder which of his children he would sacrifice to drop oil another couple of dollars a barrel?  We all know it's Eric but what's the magic number how much makes murder okay?
3973 2018-11-21 20:01:26 Please sir don't let your President spread his lies the US gets 40% of it's oil from us Canadians and only 11% from Saudi Arabia
3974 2018-11-21 20:01:25 Oil is dead find a new slant !
3975 2018-11-21 20:01:22 @Screwfix false advertising on their website. Oil filled radiator 2400w actually 2200w. When I brought this up to the duty manager was told it was a keying error. Obviously trading standards do not matter to them
3976 2018-11-21 20:01:22 Take some proto and go to bed and read you may realize that you don't understand how the oil pricing works
3977 2018-11-21 20:01:21 Veerji and I both scheduled oil change non the same day and hour apart at two different places. Here’s to waiting in the lobby 
3978 2018-11-21 20:01:12 So you let them murder people in exchange for lower oil prices?

And now that USA is #1 oil producer why do you want the price of oil to go down??
3979 2018-11-21 20:01:10 @nytimes It’s all about the condos. And the loans. And the secrets. USA gets <10% of oil imports from Saud. By contrast, 40% from Canada, yet President Perp treats Canada and its leaders with disdain.
3980 2018-11-21 20:00:57 The low oil price environment will be short lived, fracking and completions go on hold as price drops, this cuts supply  @Stavoil @okohonen
3981 2018-11-21 20:00:53 Very easy to achieve when we sell  the oil at $11 per barrel to the USA and they resell it back to Canada for the going rate, can anyone confirm this?
3982 2018-11-21 20:00:47 Same as the majority of the Reps in the UN...thus the immigration pact they are pushing.....Big Oil big Money ...Islam on the rise
3983 2018-11-21 20:00:41 No oil, I would prefer renewable
3984 2018-11-21 20:00:41 The big robber baron oil companies will transform themselves so they can still be bullies in a future where socalled "renewable" energy plays a big role
3985 2018-11-21 20:00:39 Make no mistake, we will be paying more at the pump once MBS thinks he’s been excused, and are paying more thanks to MBS negotiations w Kushner to freeze out Iran, where our cheap oil came from until recently. Iran, not Saudi Arabia.
3986 2018-11-21 20:00:39 The US gets more of its oil from Canada (40%) than from KSA (11%). He just can't bring himself to say "thank you" and "Canada" in the same sentence. I think Super Woman (@cafreeland ) scares the shit out of him
3987 2018-11-21 20:00:36 Canada also did not lead OPEC into causing the 1973 oil crisis nor does Canada require male pilots and male air traffic control personnel for their visits... also no glowing orb,
3988 2018-11-21 20:00:33 Hey, did you know that there were years when Obama's presidency had crude oil at 54$ or below?  And he didn't have to lick a homicidal Saudi prince's shoes for it either.

3990 2018-11-21 20:00:19 It's not lower because Saudi Arabia it's lower because you're stupid judge denied the XL Pipeline idiot do something about it or were going to export our oil to China and Jack our prices up for you
3991 2018-11-21 20:00:19 I'm disgusted that these francophones protest against Alberta oil while demanding more transfer payments. Welfare Frenchman.
3992 2018-11-21 20:00:12 The gathering of Mako energy as a strain on the planet is an allegory for our own gathering of resources such as oil, gas, and coal for energy. It can't be replenished by the Earth once it is used. And while nuclear energy requires non-renewable resources like uranium...

3995 2018-11-21 20:00:06 Everyone’s up in arms about #MBS killing #khashoggi and #trump giving Saudi Arabia a pass, but we’ve spent trillions and killed hundreds of thousands to protect our oil interests and allowed the killing of millions more. At least Trump is being honest (for once).

3998 2018-11-21 19:59:54 How come you haven’t visited the military troops you put at the border before thanksgiving? You have time!! Saudi Arabia brings in and kills people unchecked!! You talking about “Enjoy” an arbitrary oil price? I would say do better but you don’t have better to give!
3999 2018-11-21 19:59:52 Just a quick reminder: Anyone calling for a ban on "assault weapons" is peddling a snake oil solution and should not be trusted. Most gun crimes involve hand guns and not AR-15s. This is taking into account ALL TYPES of gun crimes per year and not just mass shootings.
4000 2018-11-21 19:59:51 Thank you, Mr Lieu, nice to know someone down there is taking notice of what is actually going on.  Oh and just so he knows, Canada, his country's biggest supplier of oil,  doesn't need him to come for a visit. Also, we don't have a glowing orb up here for him to hover over.
4001 2018-11-21 19:59:50 Lower oil --> higher corp earnings (Lower transport expenses) + more retail disposable income --> will reduce cost push inflation --> does not imply lower wages (unless macro recession) --> if higher stocks -- >> tighter Fed.
4002 2018-11-21 19:59:47 Yes. Super dried off. Then we salt overnight. I don’t baste though because I hate the idea of opening the oven door and messing up the oven temp, instead I do an oil/butter rub, you get the butter flavor but the oil raises the smoke point.
4003 2018-11-21 19:59:45 For those creative types you know, I think a Create Your Own set would be awesome. Pick the Lotion or the Oil and choose a few Essential Oils and BOOM! gift done!!! All on sale until Monday!!
4004 2018-11-21 19:59:27 Tackling the agricultural and industrial polluters (which I agree with, and which a carbon tax helps do) also means higher food prices, higher electricity prices for our peat-fired power, and higher petrol prices that oil companies sell to us.
4005 2018-11-21 19:59:25 Ummm, low oil prices have nothing to do with your friends in Saudi Arabia. Just sayin....
4006 2018-11-21 19:59:24 STOP letting niggas with dirty finger nails play in your pussy  you had a UTI for 3 week & don’t know why...Cause you got backwoods, motor oil, weed flakes, mayo, ketchup & lemon pepper seasoning in you hoe 
4007 2018-11-21 19:59:15 Saudi is the largest exporter of oil in the world. Along with UAE and Kuwait, they can put down the oil prices in the market easily by increasing supply in the global market.
4008 2018-11-21 19:59:14 The idea of overlooking an American killed by the Saudis for oil alliances is another reason to stick to my statement not to buy another vehicle powered by fossil fuels. Will you consider the same call to action?
4009 2018-11-21 19:59:04 @natural_sweets, as natural as palm oil... #deforestation #sweetasadeadmonkey
4010 2018-11-21 19:58:55 Don’t forget the oil industry needs oil to be above a certain price to make it
4011 2018-11-21 19:58:54 If u want to think it was ok. That's fine. As long as every1 realize every president for past 50 years always turn the other way with Saudi Arabia. It is what it is. It will never change until they have no oil.
4012 2018-11-21 19:58:48 Different oil barrels, try again. Liar.
4013 2018-11-21 19:58:46 I’m convinced the oil Chick-Fil-A use to fry their food is anointing oil.

4015 2018-11-21 19:58:42 Saudi (MURDER) Arabia is not our friend. I would pay double for #oil if we could use OIL FROM AMERICA!! Why aren’t you touting OIL MADE IN AMERICA like you do other products? Because they own you...#useamericanoil #americanoilfirst #USA #hypocriticalpotus
4016 2018-11-21 19:58:40 The number of drilling rigs being used has been down because of the price per barrel of oil was so low. I spent 35 years in the business of drilling. Domestic and Canadian oil are the two biggest sources of our oil. SA is 11%
4017 2018-11-21 19:58:40 Medical officials in general wonder how many humans will die without the use oil byproducts for medical equipment, or oil revenue for research in our health industry. I wonder how much government capital used to build Calgary’s new cancer clinic came from the O&G industry?
4018 2018-11-21 19:58:39 You really are a human abomination and an embarrassment!. You want lower oil prices leading to less need for alternative energy and less conservation. You ignore our CIA and support a murderous bastard for short term gain despite how it affects our reputation. Shame on you!
4019 2018-11-21 19:58:36 i’m pretty sure it’s 5000 with regular oil and 6000 with synthetic
4020 2018-11-21 19:58:32 That and 40% of US oil comes from Canada 11% from Saudi Arabia and the prick- taitor calls Canada a security risk!
4021 2018-11-21 19:58:30 That’s true , it’s the fact that a number of problems , solutions are limited ( or non existent )  , in snake oil bracket  , or outside of average club budget #challengingtimes
4022 2018-11-21 19:58:23 Why would it hurt our country, we are pumping more oil than anybody.
4023 2018-11-21 19:58:22 U.S. needs to be worried much about current situation of canadian oil prices and the political situation unfolding there, chinese intentions to expand their share than being worried about saudi arabia.. Canada represents more oil imported for the U.S. so far.
4024 2018-11-21 19:58:21 America gets 40% of its oil from Canada! Only about 15% from SA. Trump is full of shit! (Again) and you’re welcome! American journos...start calling him on this bs please!
4025 2018-11-21 19:58:16 家内のその圧倒的人間力に憧れてますよ。毎回営業先で。「マジックも良かったけど、素敵な奥さんを見つけましたね」と。

あざーすw
4026 2018-11-21 19:58:16 No, they’re not. But the problem is no one is paying their way. And there’s no big bad secret polluter out there to scapegoat. We’re the ones eating meat from farms, driving cars powered by oil, living in homes powered by coal and peat-fired electricity.
4027 2018-11-21 19:58:08 Good job Andrea - I think every hour reporters  should rebuke Trump and say it is only 14.5 billion in committments from Saudi. And it is not hundreds of thousands of jobs. Or the oil - we import 40% from Canada and 11% from saudi arabia. And yes the Crown Prince ordered it.
4028 2018-11-21 19:58:03 Why is this hitting such a nerve when MSM couldn't care less about Benghazi???....more to this than meets the eye?
4029 2018-11-21 19:58:02 So was going to bed which for me is 6am because of my work schedule.  I realized I need to register my  .DMV can be hell but if you go early it’s a breeze. Bad thing is you wait 45min outside in the cold. 24hrs now later I haven’t slept and still need to pick up  for oil swap
4030 2018-11-21 19:58:01 She is more skilled at protecting her donors. She blocked Medicare for all into her own state and she is trying to block it now for the country. Oh and she’s worth 100 million, mostly from big oil and big Pharma. She doesn’t represent us.
4031 2018-11-21 19:57:53 It was around $33 in 2008. Seeing a connection here? Nothing like a Republican caused recession to lower oil prices. Real estate slowing, stocks running out of buyback tax cut money and more tariffs. Great recession 2.0
4032 2018-11-21 19:57:51 Sadly, the US is no longer the moral leader of the free world. We’d rather prop up bald faced murders for cheap oil than take a moral stand against state sponsored torture and murder.      Our President is a complete loser.  @realDonaldTrump
4033 2018-11-21 19:57:50 He doesn't realize you guys import 40% of oil from Canada.  Saudi is about 11%...
4034 2018-11-21 19:57:49 Their prince ordered this.
The US doesnt need Saudi Oil, we get more from Canada, yet he pisses off Canada more than a murderous dictator.
The Saudis bought his apartments, fill his hotels and bailed his corrupt ass out of bankruptcy
Its not US first, its HIM first
4035 2018-11-21 19:57:49 We get almost none of our oil from the Middle East. Transportation costs aren’t worth it. Why do you know so little about our country?
4036 2018-11-21 19:57:47 They did go quiet for a year or two while the rest of the country bailed them out of the last oil crash. :)
4037 2018-11-21 19:57:45 We supply about half of our oil ourselves. We also get a good chunk of it from Canada. We should be able to shed this dependancy with green policies, that will certainly never occur under this administration.
4038 2018-11-21 19:57:36 Long suffering OILERS fan here. New coach hopefully uses 27 better. Oil have a game or two in hand and are not more then a point out right now. Oilers make the playoffs but 3 or 4 players get their knickers in a knot during the season
4039 2018-11-21 19:57:33 The reason Trump keeps upholding Saudi Arabia is because he knows not all Republican Senators are on board with what he's doing.  Now, he's trying to make Americans complicit by thanking Saudi for lower oil prices!  Don't miss that propaganda.
4040 2018-11-21 19:57:28 Stop behaving like a mechanic , putting Oil and Greece to everyone !
4041 2018-11-21 19:57:27 Not unique, there's Iran. Yes, it promotes violence against us and sometimes funds it. Cost, less oil, we're moving off it anyway. Benefit, less oppression, less genocide, less sexusm, less homophobia.
4042 2018-11-21 19:57:26 You’re literally thanking Saudi Arabia for killing a man in exchange for lower oil prices! You’re an Absolutely disgusting human being
4043 2018-11-21 19:57:25 Get those Texas oil fields going also !
4044 2018-11-21 19:57:21 You'll never find your gold on a sandy beach
You'll never drill for oil on a city street
4045 2018-11-21 19:57:17 The US needs a transparent policy team to educate us & enlighten The President. The weapons of mass destruction reason for invading Iraq was motivated by oil. But now I know there were deeper forces at play here. It was a mistake w/ long term consequences to us.
4046 2018-11-21 19:57:09 Who wants to tell our idiot President that we get 40% of our oil from Canada  and only 11% from Saudi Arabia . We should be thanking  
@JustinTrudeau and not the 
thugs from Saudi.
4047 2018-11-21 19:57:05 The current drop in oil prices has little to nothing to do with Saudi Arabia, and the U.S. is the world's top oil producing country.
4048 2018-11-21 19:57:02 You do know that too low is BAD for our oil producers, right.  If it's America first then you have this all wrong!
4049 2018-11-21 19:57:01 Not to mention the Saudis are going to do everything in their power to ensure oil goes up. I read 65% of their economy is based on energy. This is just another dumb tweet by potus.
4050 2018-11-21 19:56:59 During Obama's last month in office the price of a barrel of oil was $2 cheaper than the price you are bragging about.

AND, he didn't have to cover for a murderer to make that happen.
4051 2018-11-21 19:56:40 And oil prices are declining on the assumption of an economic slowdown, not gifts for murderous Saudis
4052 2018-11-21 19:56:36 Low oil prices are not reflective of a healthy economy...sooooo....
4053 2018-11-21 19:56:24 Awwww
4054 2018-11-21 19:56:23 Ok so you think that lower oil prices are good for the USA? I recall higher oil prices being one of the things that bolstered our economy and helped us out of the Great Recession. Maybe check in with your economists before you record your ineptitude.
4055 2018-11-21 19:56:12 Who sets the price of oil? Certainly not Canada. Hint:  It starts with an "O" .
4056 2018-11-21 19:56:10 Didn’t get my oil changed for two years and my engine caught fire last week. Sad but true, learn from me

4058 2018-11-21 19:55:58 Sorry, Senator but without saudi oil US dollar is meaningless. POTUS is thinking about this aspect.
4059 2018-11-21 19:55:57 How's the biggest oil spill in history off the east coast been delt with ? ... Minister of environment ???  No comment?   Crickets

4062 2018-11-21 19:55:50 Just following your meandering train of thought. Throughout this you have not proposed 1 solution, but engaged in proving somehow D are pure of heart and R are corrupt white vote stealers. I on the other hand proposed 1 solution.
4063 2018-11-21 19:55:47 Prices are going to increase regardless because if greedy oil tycoons.

4065 2018-11-21 19:55:42 Oil changes really run you $100 easy. 
4066 2018-11-21 19:55:37 Exactly. If you look at gas prices the last time oil was this low , they were substantially lower in comparison. The difference is taxes. We catch a break with lower oil and the states rapidly infringe on that savings by raising  taxes on gas.
4067 2018-11-21 19:55:33 It's good news for consumers. America is the largest consumer of oil products. =Good news for Americans
4068 2018-11-21 19:55:30 I might be crazy but I think they want him to war with the saudis bc  they want the oil prices to skyrocket, they want stocks to plummet, so they can blame Trump. They hate that the economy is going well. They couldn't give 2 sh!ts about a Turkish journalist. Just my opinion.

4071 2018-11-21 19:55:17 thanks to the oil change place for leaving one tire 5 psi less than the other three?
4072 2018-11-21 19:54:58 Yes lets keep Scottish oil rolling in Crossrail, HS2 are over budget and desperately need the cash and of course we have Trident bill of £200bn to pay for ..all thanks to Scotland.  I feel better together don't you??
4073 2018-11-21 19:54:58 Like it'd make 2 cents difference who's to the president. Gotta have that oil.
4074 2018-11-21 19:54:56 @realDonaldTrump There will be no revolution in Iran, unless Iran's oil is completely cut off, this is the only way
4075 2018-11-21 19:54:54 My goal in life is to be so rich that I can buy awesome Christmas gifts to my relatives and make them feel bad because they only bought me chocolates full of palm oil
4076 2018-11-21 19:54:53 圧倒的な人間力！
4077 2018-11-21 19:54:50 Lower prices at the pump are nice, but do you understand the oil market is tanking due to worsening economic conditions? And tanking oil prices is not exactly great news for your red petro-state economies.
4078 2018-11-21 19:54:48 You are stupid; callous and evil. 
So because we didn't vote an evil man that is why the railway in the east where the oil feeding this country should be abandoned; Jihadist.

4081 2018-11-21 19:54:37 Lmao at the dealership I pay 26$ for an oil change and I get paid to do it on my truck this is a loophole
4082 2018-11-21 19:54:31 @realDonaldTrump Let me tell the truth that it is bitter, I live in Iran, and I know that when our protest is really pushing for our people, this pressure comes when Iran's oil is completely cut off.
4083 2018-11-21 19:54:22 Oil prices always go down in the Winter. People drive less. Supply and Demand. #businessman 
4084 2018-11-21 19:54:20 My Trump Dump of the day - after Saudi Arabia kills an American reporter, our president publicly thanks them for lower oil prices that they had little to do with. He’s soft and an ass-kisser. #trumpdump

4087 2018-11-21 19:54:12 Question : Do you use toasted or untoasted sesame oil in your stir fry?
4088 2018-11-21 19:54:08 Think OIL.....lots and lots of OIL
4089 2018-11-21 19:54:07 Trying to connect with worldy ppl when you're chosen to be set apart is like trying to mix oil & water.
4090 2018-11-21 19:54:07 You’re right but I think what Dr Wald is referring to is that market dislocations have Canadian crude trading at heavy discounts to global benchmarks. For example, oil sands benchmark WCS is ~$17/barrel. So bad for US, yes, worse for Canada, certainly
4091 2018-11-21 19:54:03 Remeber you sell oil too Genius
4092 2018-11-21 19:54:02 So much for the Aloha you used to speak of. As penance Saudi Arabia is being made our bitch by plummeting oil prices. Thanks for negotiating that for us, @realDonaldTrump
4093 2018-11-21 19:53:53 I'm with you, but Saudi Arabia has zero to do with the lower gas prices we're seeing. There's a glut of oil on the world market and guess who the biggest producer is? You got it, USA.
4094 2018-11-21 19:53:47 Smoke & mirrors!  You want us to be satisfied with the murder of Khashoggi & the holding of his children, 3 who are US citizens, by MBS simply because oil prices are lower?
4095 2018-11-21 19:53:46 I think if i had to guess i’d say Heaven smells like Argan oil
4096 2018-11-21 19:53:44 Tell us, what's the REAL % of oil we REALLY get from SA? VERY VERY VERY low. Smdh

4098 2018-11-21 19:53:42 Agreed. Thanks for the shout out to Canada and our oil..
4099 2018-11-21 19:53:42 Ok hold on, are u saying JT is correct the Oil Industry is in fact...better shape under his govt than the past govt? The fact remains more $$ has left for the US than invested in Can under his hand. Yet the world demand is up. Why?
4100 2018-11-21 19:53:40 Man made climate change is a lie. We ended the ice age a few years before anyone ever drilled for oil. Get over yourselves.
4101 2018-11-21 19:53:39 Start trying to goggle a little peppermint oil
4102 2018-11-21 19:53:39 Yes APC propaganda stopped them from saving and completing projects. 

He removed subsidy to avert the pressure of falling oil prices, and invest the funds into infrastructure and education but you guys went to camp in Ojota and sponsored concert for one week.
4103 2018-11-21 19:53:37 You know you have nothing to do with setting world oil prices right?  Or is this the saudis way to thank you for you literally letting them get away with murder? Blood money?
4104 2018-11-21 19:53:35 You know your president is a piece of crap when he ignores a violation of human rights, over lower oil prices.
4105 2018-11-21 19:53:26 It's not about oil prices...that's just a cover...
4106 2018-11-21 19:53:24 Data is oil. Company that exploits it is not held accountable when it leaks.
4107 2018-11-21 19:53:18 Actually pretty much everybody who works in the oil and gas idustry tries to make it sound like a bad thing.
4108 2018-11-21 19:53:18 . @realDonaldTrump

Aren't they wonderful? They bail you out multiple times from bankruptcy. They lower oil prices to make you look good (even though we get most of it oil from Canada). They kill journalists so you won't have to.

A match made in heaven!

4109 2018-11-21 19:53:13 Its the oil fumes.
4110 2018-11-21 19:53:13 The day US sanctions Saudi Arabia, there will be no more weapons sales, and Saudi increase the output of oil and make price go lower, which for US would be a total disaster. Money rules, always have
4111 2018-11-21 19:53:04 Just stop buying oil.
4112 2018-11-21 19:53:02 DO YOU SELL PRODUCTS THAT CONTAIN NO PALM OIL?, OR DON'T YOU GIVE A TOSS!.
4113 2018-11-21 19:53:00 Who thinks that Trump is so goddamn stupid he’ll never realize that whoever is president doesn’t have one fucking thing to do at the price of gas or oil?
4114 2018-11-21 19:52:57 Also, WTI oil spiked 1.75% today 

Global Demand/Supply didn't change +2% in 24 hrs

Oil doesn't do what House Saud wants 

Oil does what Wall World wants 

An economic lesson for a President that's totally clueless as to how markets actually work
4115 2018-11-21 19:52:55 Every dog has its day, and every snake oil salesman gets exposed ,players R just starting to realize, it’s not Cal system to get into the NBA,it is their talent, and why not , just stay close to home, near family,work with someone you know, because they aregoing to the NBA anyway
4116 2018-11-21 19:52:54 Also, Canada provides the majority of your oil imports. But sure, he can cheer on a murderous dictatorship.
4117 2018-11-21 19:52:53 The players involved in National City Lines were GM, Firestone Tire, Phillips Oil and Standard Oil (Chevron). That particular fiasco is amazingly complicated because the joint interest seemed to be selling their own product -- diesel busses -- rather than outright dismantling.
4118 2018-11-21 19:52:52 SO, IF YOUR A OIL SALESMAN. MURDER IS O.K!
4119 2018-11-21 19:52:52 The USA is a larger exporter of oil then Saudi Arabia...
4120 2018-11-21 19:52:51 U.S. oil prices settle higher on expectations for output cut
4121 2018-11-21 19:52:51 Well, a Muslim Brotherhood Operative was not murdered. An American resident was murdered. Also, sanctions on Saudi would not effect oil prices. They are plunging which is a sign of a global economic meltdown is coming.
4122 2018-11-21 19:52:46 I had a crazy dream my vape pen exploded while I was hitting it & all this oil started uncontrollably leaking all over the place. Lmfao
4123 2018-11-21 19:52:45 Fun fact: Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
4124 2018-11-21 19:52:37 It more had to do with oil and the American dollar.
4125 2018-11-21 19:52:35 Trudeau is still buying Saudi oil.
4126 2018-11-21 19:52:31 They tried to say we got tires at $118 each you interested today ...hahaha NO BITCH DO MY FREE OIL CHANGE SO I CAN DIP WHEN I GET BACK TO GET MY CAR!
4127 2018-11-21 19:52:31 They are ignorant. I do not think one person should destabilize an ally. Right now, Saudi Arabia is one of our closest allies in the Middle East. It is also a very important oil export for us.
4128 2018-11-21 19:52:28 Still be landlocked, where would you ship oil to?
4129 2018-11-21 19:52:26 yes i have significantly got even more connected with maryland aka baltimore 
4130 2018-11-21 19:52:23 @alroker Have you tried MCT oil with the Keto thing?  Happy Thanksgiving to you and your family.  Will be watching the parade tomorrow - knock it out of the park!
4131 2018-11-21 19:52:22 The route is manageable which would imply no less or more safe than any other route. Why is it then ok to bring foreign oil into the lower mainland for consumption and not ok to ship it out for export?  Also who is using single wall oil tankers?
4132 2018-11-21 19:52:21 Sorry, I can't tonight, I have to contain and clean up massive 14-year oil spill in gulf of mexico, which has leaked more than a million barrels of oil since 2004, or face fines of $40,000 per day
4133 2018-11-21 19:52:17 I love driving right after an oil change. Ride is smooth af
4134 2018-11-21 19:52:15 Most of US oil is imported from Canada 40 to 43%.  SA is second!
4135 2018-11-21 19:52:15 This is a non sequitur. Global oil prices are low for everyone because of Saudi exports, regardless of who one is buying their oil from.
4136 2018-11-21 19:52:12 Who gives a rats ass what Trump has to say!! The real problem is with CANADA! Our spineless government(s) can’t or won’t get Alberta’s oil to tidewater and get fair market value for Canadian oil!! The left are the ones wanting better social programs. Where does the$comefrom?
4137 2018-11-21 19:52:08 His loyalty is not to arms & oil from Saudi, but from getting him out of Bankruptcy. Saudi is Trump’s ATM. It’s Trump first not America first.
4138 2018-11-21 19:52:08 @realDonaldTrump We get 40% of our oil from Canada and only 11% from Saudi Arabia.  Do you not know this?  I haven't heard you grovel to Trudeau lately, but then the Canadians haven't killed any of our residents either.
4139 2018-11-21 19:52:07 Why is gas and diesel fuel so High if oil prices are low
4140 2018-11-21 19:52:07 That year, we used to be proud saying " I am from Warri; oil city". It's no more so. Until recently with this crazy traffic in Lagos, I could boast of driving in Lagos as late as 11:30pm even as a woman. But not in my beloved home state Delta state. I dare not.
4141 2018-11-21 19:51:58 Honestly we have turned a blind eye to Saudi's abusers forever. Religious intolerance, beheadings, women's rights, anti-Israel, Yemen, etc. Oil, military bases, money, location, etc.has always trumped our current moral hypocritical outrage. This just another example of the same
4142 2018-11-21 19:51:51 When the Saudis ask us to leave, start buying Russian weapons and selling oil in yuan you might realize what happens when the petrodollar goes away.

Still I am for that happening.
4143 2018-11-21 19:51:50 Thanks to Exxon and other oil companies for purchasing our politicians thus creating man made climate change. And a special thanks to ANY politician that took oil money in trade for oil subsidies and other disastrous policy considerations.  Thank you to republicans for helping

4149 2018-11-21 19:51:37 More journalists death, better oil prices??
4150 2018-11-21 19:51:36 We export our oil & buy from the Saudis. Something wrong with that?
4151 2018-11-21 19:51:35 Also, just to be clear, nationalism has never been a synonym for patriotism. Ever. One is a love and defense of country because of what it is and what it stands for, the other is defense and love of country no matter what it is or what it stands for. They are,  in fact, opposites
4152 2018-11-21 19:51:33 trump: I made a great deal.

4156 2018-11-21 19:51:22 The only thing my mom really translates from traditional Thanksgiving is stuffing. Don't know why, but stuffing made the cut. But the main differences are in how everything is prepared. For example, "gravy" isn't American gravy. It is more like an oil based sauce for example.

4160 2018-11-21 19:51:03 Not really, no. Submerging food in oil is not really a thing in these parts of the world. Frying in general, sure, but not to the extent deep fried dishes are cooked in the US. (at least to my knowledge)
4161 2018-11-21 19:50:55 Oil was at 53$ when Obama left office, and he didn't need to thank any murderers.
4162 2018-11-21 19:50:53 how many barrels of oil for a life? Shame!
4163 2018-11-21 19:50:48 No President has ever "gone lower" than this remark. Oil prices over a human life. Shameful!
4164 2018-11-21 19:50:42 Oil people STILL make more than the average American. It’ll be fine for the majority. Oh sorry...just realized this was another opportunity to dis our great President. You’ll get over it, most #tds folks or accustomed to losing. So who’s the idiot?
4165 2018-11-21 19:50:36 I liked it when Obama was president and oil was $30 a barrel. I miss Obama so much, unlike the Dump, he was so intelligent, kind and honest, unlike you he was not a sexual abuser and pathological liar.

4174 2018-11-21 19:50:09 So what you're saying is you're dismayed that Trump doesn't point out oil prices are low because Canada has an idiot acting as PM for the guy (@gmbutts) who pledged to ruin our oil industry? 

I wouldn't "boast" that we're the main supplier of oil because the US is f**king us.

4176 2018-11-21 19:50:08 Oil prices are set by the world stock market now. Have been for a long time. Canada sells (exports) oil for the same price as SA only US buys (imports) 40% from Canada and 11% from SA.

4180 2018-11-21 19:50:05 Hey DJ. This really does show how much you dont understand about oil and the economy. Oil prices have been  low since 2014 with Obama in the house. WTF?!!
4181 2018-11-21 19:50:05 I bet you still buy gas made with their oil.
4182 2018-11-21 19:50:05 OPEC doesn’t control the price of the oil anymore now that America and Russia have stepped up production so your line of logic is flawed as always.

4184 2018-11-21 19:49:58 Oil is more important for plastics than fuel.
4185 2018-11-21 19:49:57 Good to know that to the @GOP blood is worth less than oil.
4186 2018-11-21 19:49:51 The entire oil and gas industry was struck a huge blow by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau’s National Energy Program that capped oil prices below world levels and slapped a confiscatory tax on the gross revenues of energy companies....looks like  you learnt well from your father
4187 2018-11-21 19:49:49 Who else can you sacrifice for cheaper oil? Obviously not anyone white but I'm sure you will find someone we know how much you care about the deal.
4188 2018-11-21 19:49:49 Don’t we get about 10% of our oil from Saudi Arabia and 40% from Canada? And Justin Trudeau hasn’t ordered the death of a journalist at least to my knowledge.
4189 2018-11-21 19:49:46 Canada also buys Saudi oil
4190 2018-11-21 19:49:36 World stock markets climbed on Wednesday, with earnings and gains  in tech stocks lifting shares on Wall Street, and oil rebounded from a  steep sell-off as U.S. government data pointed to strong demand.
4191 2018-11-21 19:49:33 What about oil producing lands, or precious metals, commercial real estate, farms etc and you call me a fucking moron. 
4192 2018-11-21 19:49:27 Trumps BS about oil prices is a hollow threat. If the Saudis want to supersize the movement to clean energy, all they have to do is raise prices. Trumps worried about his profits not our cost
4193 2018-11-21 19:49:27 The market goes both ways, too. Both US & Canadian oil production by fracking & oil sands extraction has flooded the world market in recent years, and that’s brought down prices worldwide. Saudi Arabia has increased production, but only to keep market share. Nil effect on prices.
4194 2018-11-21 19:49:19 I have a random question..

When there is an oil spill in the ocean, is the oil capable of being ignited once it reaches the surface? Or does that only happen after raw oil has been processed and concentrated?
4195 2018-11-21 19:49:17 @MarinGeneral I was curious if you have heard of CBD Oil or not and it's connections to pain management among other uses.  I would love to speak with you about it when you have a moment.  I have been using it for a few weeks and have no pain whatsoever anymore.  Please msg me.
4196 2018-11-21 19:49:08 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
4197 2018-11-21 19:49:07 Considering that we need to get #offfossilfuels or die off in the next few generations, I’d say we should tell him to shove his oil up his ass, then move to alternative forms of fuel STAT. Regardless.
4198 2018-11-21 19:49:04 Why thank the Saudis when the US also has vast reserves and Canadian oil is the cheapest it's ever been. You really have no idea how markets work do you?
4199 2018-11-21 19:49:02 if u do not steer a ship from an iceberg when u first spot it always end in a major crash that where the us economy and oil prices are.
4200 2018-11-21 19:49:02 what would inspire more would be you taking action on oil spill off Newfoundland DO YOUR JOB
4201 2018-11-21 19:48:58 He's got to be very naive or delusional to really think he is the one taking down oil prices, or driving markets up (when that go up), or commanding the FED on what to do

4205 2018-11-21 19:48:39 You have no idea what’s going on with oil. Saudis at full production ahead of potential OPEC cuts.  US bringing on more production and 2 new pipelines coming next year to deliver more oil to ports. Good Bloomberg article today. TellSaudis to f.... themselves. No business w killer
4206 2018-11-21 19:48:33 That snake oil merchant stole my presidency.
4207 2018-11-21 19:48:33 Cheap oil at the cost of a journalist’s life.... Donald, your lack of compassion and myopic self-absorption is yuge.
#trumpTheWorstPresident
4208 2018-11-21 19:48:32 Since Trudeau and the Liberal Party are deliberately destroying the oil industry and the Alberta economy, nothing good will come of his latest selfie tour
4209 2018-11-21 19:48:26 But they have oil and we want to keep gas prices down. So none of that is important.
4210 2018-11-21 19:48:17 Trudeau will be speaking in Calgary on Novemver 22nd (tomorrow).

What excuses will have about the state of our oil&gas?

#yyc
4211 2018-11-21 19:48:10 Let’s face it. If it weren’t for oil we wouldn’t be in the Middle East at all!
4212 2018-11-21 19:48:09 If the price of gas is high enough, it will stimulate further development of alternative fuel and power sources, so in my humble opinion I don't mind paying the price for gas I think we need to focus on a #GreenNewDeal post haste. Furthermore if the price of oil goes too low /1
4213 2018-11-21 19:48:09 Prepping the turkeys for tomorrow!  Just diced up the turkey I shot in the spring, and am prepping the marinade for injection now.  Beer batter tomorrow morning for the diced bird.  Hot peanut oil for both later on!
4214 2018-11-21 19:48:05 They have a lot of oil my friend
4215 2018-11-21 19:48:04 Cut ties with them. Stop the weapons deals(that shouldn't be happening in the first place), stop buying their oil? Sounds like a good place to start.
4216 2018-11-21 19:47:54 Man go just de yarn nonsense because star chef somebody that will drink hot oil.
4217 2018-11-21 19:47:52 Really? Is this payment for your support in not holding Saudi Arabia accountable for the murder of the US journalist? If we moved toward renewable energy sources and away from oil & coal, this wouldn’t be an issue.
4218 2018-11-21 19:47:52 He wants us to thank him for the low oil prices and forget that he said about Mr. K who was murdered, "It is what it is."
And doesn't America has its own oil?

4221 2018-11-21 19:47:48 History recorded in the 1970’s the equation of Saudi petro dollars into America&the US apart, of buy oil also provide military aid&arms.
The interdependence between US&Saudi Arabia developed, with private arrangements of Saudis buying treasuries. It’s impact, is present today.
4222 2018-11-21 19:47:45 I thought Republicans were for energy independence? What happened to all the domestic oil boom of a few years ago?
4223 2018-11-21 19:47:44 Brown or cane sugar, honey, coconut or olive oil, and hmmm a hint for the last item?
4224 2018-11-21 19:47:36 Fuel prices skyrocketed after Hurricane Katrina. Years after we were still paying over $3/gal at times. Prices will continue to rise to increase profits. Drops in oil prices will not match price drops at the pump. 

Why? Greed.
4225 2018-11-21 19:47:35 oil below 20 coming up that will concide with crypto 1100 and a 2000 point dow plunge US deficits to soar to 50 trillion
4226 2018-11-21 19:47:32 No blood on our oil. Canada eh.
4227 2018-11-21 19:47:31 Tire fixed, oil changed, tank full, grams, and donuts! Whew God is working today 
4228 2018-11-21 19:47:28 Then why are we paying 3.00 plus average at the pumps? Who gains?   The oil gasoline companies @exxonmobil @Chevron @BP_plc @arco @StandardOilCo @Shell
4229 2018-11-21 19:47:26 It’s not even factual (surprise!) to line the Sauds with the oil price to that extent. U.S gets <10% of its oil imports from Saud. About 40% from Canada, which #Trump just insults, and which has killed and chopped up exactly zero USA residents. Or even anyone!
4230 2018-11-21 19:47:25 uh, you're thinking of canada, where we get 40% of our imported oil, as opposed to saudi arabia, where we get only 11%.  fucking learn to read.
4231 2018-11-21 19:47:23 How does it work?  The last time oil prices spiked, it lead to an increased cost in transportation, and I saw food prices spike as a result.  (When the price of oil dropped, the price of food still remained at the same price...)
4232 2018-11-21 19:47:22 exactly! unfortunately the imbeciles in the cult only know and believe in what their dear leader tells them. Donald has warned that if we don't approve murderous dictators slaughtering everyone everywhere who criticize them,  the oil prices will sky rocket.
4233 2018-11-21 19:47:20 Oil was $53.06 per barrel on the day you took office. It went up to $82 under your watch, dimwit. So now you want us to be grateful that it's *almost* as low as it was before you began ruining the world economy?

4236 2018-11-21 19:47:17 Is Donnie aware that us oil production is profitable only when prices are high?
4237 2018-11-21 19:47:13 The u.s. imports only 11% of Saudi oil. Stop trying to pitch how great the saudis are. Traitor
4238 2018-11-21 19:47:12 What are americas oil companies saying to this?
4239 2018-11-21 19:47:11 Donald Trump has just tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to 'a big Tax Cut for America and the World!' In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia. CBC
4240 2018-11-21 19:47:06 Too stupid to know Papa Putin needs the price high in order to make Russia great. The price of oil and Russia's economy have the opposite relationship. When oil prices drop, Russia suffers greatly. Oil & gas are 60% of Russia's exports and provide more than 30%  of GDP.

If a Dem was in office, they'd be saying what a great job of cutting costs for avg Americans.
4244 2018-11-21 19:46:56 Thanks Saudi for cheap oil, and massive guns buyers, and killing children in Yemen, and killing the Journalists! This is a good deal for you Mr @realDonaldTrump No Me! At what price??
4245 2018-11-21 19:46:56 you're still selling the branded palm oil products. Iceland’s Richard Walker states that they are not anti-palm oil but against deforestation. everyone has seen the ad without you having to pay the tv fees +your sales will be boosted by all this. yeah, thats a clear message.
4246 2018-11-21 19:46:56 Greed is the root of all evil. Remember that when yr family goes down, lower than oil prices

4256 2018-11-21 19:46:31 It’s past time to look at tRump’s major donors as the problem. Exxon has suppressed that climate change is real for decades. Trump is forging a northern global alliance on behalf of Arctic extraction interests to assure ongoing addiction to oil.
4257 2018-11-21 19:46:29 1 day left to protect the #rainforest, #orangutans, and #palmoil workers from greedy companies like @Indofood! RT to tell @RSPOtweets, the global palm oil body, to vote to stop certifying destructive palm oil in its new Principles and Criteria #RSPO #RT16
4258 2018-11-21 19:46:29 When Trump’s ‘big dick’ persona could actually help in dealing with the recent diplomatic inconsistency of the Saudis. He tucks it between his legs to ask for an oil subsidy. I think the biggest shocker of this presidency is that it’s exactly like all those before it.
4259 2018-11-21 19:46:26 Canada is actually the biggest supplier Of oil to the United States. So I await Canada’s thank you tweet.
4260 2018-11-21 19:46:24 People Canada sells oil at the price that the Saudi's and the Arab nations set. You can't be that clueless or maybe you can
4261 2018-11-21 19:46:23 Drink some vinegar and oil asap!!
4262 2018-11-21 19:46:23 It is about who controls the oil prices, not how much the United States imports!
Saudi Arabia could let the price goes up to 150$ and Canada would sell in that price to the US.

It strains credulity to think it wont be priced at least partially in CNY

4273 2018-11-21 19:45:53 Sweet potatoes ( yams? That even sounds bad) should be baked, chopped up coarsely with skins on, lavished with good olive oil, salt and pepper, and red pepper flakes. I call this creation 
" Spicy smashed sweet potatoes"
4274 2018-11-21 19:45:50 I saw this several times today but I want to repeat it again - about 40% of imported oil to the US comes from Canada. Only 11% from Saudi Arabia! Don't think if tramp would've condemned the Saudis you would pay more at the pump, it's a lie! He's a liar!

4278 2018-11-21 19:45:42 It’s called a Global Oil Market for a reason! Saudi Arabia takes 1/2 its oil off the market the world market price for oil goes over $100/barrel.
The exact percent we get from Saudi Arabia means nothing.
4279 2018-11-21 19:45:39 Longing for the good ol’ days in political life when even if it WAS a lie, a POTUS (eg Shrub) at least had the common sense to not commit political suicide by denying it WAS about “blood for oil”.
4280 2018-11-21 19:45:38 Maybe if dJT lets them kill some more American journalists, they will give us oil free.  SMDH

4287 2018-11-21 19:45:15 there is something that went on in WW2 that was bigger than oil that seems to be unbreakable by any president over anything-it seems we are shielding the Saudi's but there is something much deeper than I am afraid we know nothing about-Thanks FDR he has tied our hands forever
4288 2018-11-21 19:45:01 Lower oil prices means no money for OPEC for funny projects like global terrorism. That's right- USA's greatest weapon is the US economy. Notice how your enemies fall apart when you stop outsourcing, offshoring and buying foreign oil? So simple.

4290 2018-11-21 19:45:01 Lower oil prices hurt our energy sector.
4291 2018-11-21 19:45:00 To be fair, though he probably wouldn’t be the same, Saudi Arabia is the swing producer and largely controls world oil prices along with the US shale producers. US oil imports are the lowest in 20 years.

4303 2018-11-21 19:44:33 Canada also buys Saudi oil
4304 2018-11-21 19:44:28 It is not important who exports oil to you, but it is important to control prices and can increase production to lower prices
4305 2018-11-21 19:44:27 Just like they’re buying all their oil from Russia. C’mon Amy. Don’t be a sucker
4306 2018-11-21 19:44:27 You do realize the Saudis and OPEC drove down oil prices few years ago to shut down American fracking to quash competition, right? How do we get energy independence when we openly declare we need Saudi oil or else?
4307 2018-11-21 19:44:25 ...blindly march towards a well-meaning but ultimately unhelpful or damaging blanket boycott. Palm oil is a big problem. But so are the other big players when it comes to deforestation & habitat loss. And if we aren't changing our eating habits or consumerist expectations, we...
4308 2018-11-21 19:44:25 The irony is that the Saudis are NOT driving the gas prices down. It’s our own production of oil that is. We are the largest oil producer in the world. Trump is looking to his personal bottom line here, and he is a traitor who must be locked up.
4309 2018-11-21 19:44:23 You are disgusting.  A journalist was murdered by your Saudi friends and you're okay with it as long as we get their oil. We don't need their oil.  We need a President with morals and a conscience.

4317 2018-11-21 19:44:04 By far the leading exporter of crude oil to the U.S. is Canada, w/ whom he wants to have a trade war. Saudi's 2nd, Iraq is 3rd, Venezuela 4th, Mexico (whom he called "rapists") is 5th.
4318 2018-11-21 19:44:02 @BBCBreaking #Saudi #oil will #find it's #way onto the #world #market #regardless of circumstances. #Trumps #trade war has #already wreaked #more #havoc on the #world #economy than misguided #weapons #transactions. #Screw the #crown #prince.
4319 2018-11-21 19:44:00 Oil people STILL make more than the average American. It’ll be fine for the majority. Oh sorry...just realized this was another opportunity to dis our great President. You’ll get over it, most #tds folks or accustomed to losing.
4320 2018-11-21 19:43:56 The president uses his first tweet of the day to let the world know you can brutally kill journalists living and working in the United States as long as you sell America oil on the cheap. Item #264,345 that would have been political suicide for a normal politician.
4321 2018-11-21 19:43:54 Take what money?  

Defending our oil is defending Canada!
4322 2018-11-21 19:43:46 Yo...we supply the USA with oil more than Saudi's Trump is too stupid to know this. Also, regarding relations Saudi's hate my country now and expelled diplomats however our prices just went down. Trump logic is fucked
4323 2018-11-21 19:43:43 I agree but we shouldn't have to since they only produce 11% of the oil now. The US and Canada both produce more than they do.
4324 2018-11-21 19:43:38 Trump what is wrong with you
I thing it's about the money and oil how can you turn your back on the American people with this Saudi situation it's so sad you've seen the video and still you don't say or do anything 
4325 2018-11-21 19:43:37 Blood oil on your hands. You can’t go any lower. #indictments incoming, #IllegitimatePresident .
4326 2018-11-21 19:43:36 Yasir you're too religious for my liking, you can't even hold my hands, not even a peck, hug or kiss, you dont love me...
4327 2018-11-21 19:43:36 Agreed. Fried in peanut oil and it leaves a bad aftertaste in my mouth.
4328 2018-11-21 19:43:29 The reason it's lower is because the economy is slagging. Lower oil prices means fewer jobs in Texas, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Ohio. Everything is so simple to Trump. He has no nuance or understanding of complex issues.
4329 2018-11-21 19:43:29 Trump - I’ll maintain my morales over low gasoline price any day. An American citizen was murdered by a foreign government and you thank them for low oil prices - disgusting
4330 2018-11-21 19:43:28 I hate ggetting oil changes , knew I was going to be here all day 
4331 2018-11-21 19:43:22 Le 7 sorelle che non esistono più? Un mercato petrolifero controllato dalle Nic (saudita aramco produce il doppio di exxon) il mercato shale oil controllato dalle indipendant
4332 2018-11-21 19:43:21 Measure the amount of oil you need using water and the turkey. Make sure the turkey is thawed all the way and dry. Don't drop it in, lowe...
4333 2018-11-21 19:43:19 SoCal do you even know who we import the most oil from? And how Saudi Arabia imports compare? Obviously not, because otherwise you would not have made such a foolish comment.
4334 2018-11-21 19:43:17 Oil of the nut of the coco.
4335 2018-11-21 19:43:16 Syrians do control that 30% and oil lands. It’s just that most of those Syrian Kurds and Arabs oppose the Assad regime.

Syria
4336 2018-11-21 19:43:16 Honorable Senator.  POTUS is thanking arabia for depressing oil prices.  California is an oil producing state, this will cause jobs here in the southland, and other oil producing areas.  Those workers are his base.
4337 2018-11-21 19:43:12 Canada also buys Saudi oil
4338 2018-11-21 19:43:11 I am still looking for graphs or tables or texts that show what they predicted about CCUS, BECCS, oil and gas. Do you have anything specific I can use to draw a comparison?
4339 2018-11-21 19:43:08 Judas sold Jesus to be tortured and killed for 30 pieces of silver; you sold Jamal Khashoggi to be tortured and killed for a couple of bucks on a barrel of oil. PUT AMERICA’S SOUL FIRST!!!
4340 2018-11-21 19:43:07 Sis put the oil cause she wouldn’t take my no, now ima have to go to my actual hairstylist and get my hair fully done again cause shit won’t last 2 days cause shit about to turn into a oily pool of hair smh

-Don't do it
-More Gendo
-More Kaji
-They really should have left well enough alone though
4343 2018-11-21 19:43:03 You do realize that only 11% of our oil comes from SA. 40% comes from Canada. A little ironic, no?
4344 2018-11-21 19:42:57 It's delicious though when you lie to yourself and say it's so moist and succulent like it's not the oil fry the deep fryer
4345 2018-11-21 19:42:50 Black Caster Oil does not smell good at all
4346 2018-11-21 19:42:47 Yes ,great no matter how many Americans are dead , it's a great deal with saudi !  Lives for oil!
4347 2018-11-21 19:42:46 It's obvious that the great hordes of middle-earth who push the oil out of the ground are engineering global warming because one day they hope to emerge and take over after we all die off in balmy 160 degree weather.
4348 2018-11-21 19:42:46 If 98 plays the way he has started in Bakersfield, his callup is imminent. Playing assertive, like the power forward he is supposed to be. If this is the real Jesse, he will assuredly help the NHL club sooner rather than later. We need him.

4352 2018-11-21 19:42:30 So you're butthurt Canada didn't get a thanks & made a disingenuous straw man? The problem is Saudi Arabia leads the OPEC cartel of countries which accounts for 44% of the world's oil production and *greatly* influences oil prices! Their influence still remains disproportionate!
4353 2018-11-21 19:42:27 #Trump says: He's not going to destroy economy FOR OUR COUNTRY  by being foolish with Saudi Arabia. 
1)AGAIN Trump has poor communication skills.
2)Since when has our economy been based on our relationship & trade with Saudi Arabia.
LIES!
We're not talking about an oil deal

All possible BUT the oil company’s have a better plan. Keep up the #fear & increase price of oil gas until it’s gone. #CarbonTax
4361 2018-11-21 19:42:18 Between the lines: There are two major varieties of oil on the market, and Trump used a near-peak price of one to make the near-bottom price of the other seem more dramatic. West Texas Intermediate is indeed $54, but was only at $75 during its recent high in October
4362 2018-11-21 19:42:16 Since Canada provides aprx 37% of US oil, I wonder what @JustinTrudeau could get away with?
4363 2018-11-21 19:42:04 Actually - we currently produce more oil than Saudi Arabia. They're not driving oil prices - we are.
4364 2018-11-21 19:42:00 I think now we know the price of a human life for potus, $30 dollars less per oil barrel. If This Is not living under an authoritarian, tyrant, etc prospect to be, them I don't what his followers think it May be #trumpKingofFakeNews
4365 2018-11-21 19:41:59 Good morning everyone. I'm starting this off by live tweeting my oil change! #live2265
4366 2018-11-21 19:41:58 Good Night Bob-it is nice to voice opinions when u don't have all the info-that thing between the Saudis and FDR seems unbreakable so it must be something so secret that only Presidents can know-it is more than just some oil me thinks
4367 2018-11-21 19:41:56 Part of the reason why we are seeing salmonella/ecoli outbreaks is because no one cleans properly. As much as I love essential oils, no essential oil is going to kill that kind of bacteria. Use a bleach cleaner!

4372 2018-11-21 19:41:40 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
4373 2018-11-21 19:41:33 Remember when trump supporters were saying that we didn’t get our oil from Saudi Arabia? I do too
4374 2018-11-21 19:41:33 I will never settle for any less respect then what I get from my brothers. Isaac legit came over and got my car this morning to change my oil.
4375 2018-11-21 19:41:30 USA imports 11% from Saudi and 40% from Canada. Saudi is not a big oil player for you. Trump must have some personal reason for staying close to a murderous regime.
4376 2018-11-21 19:41:22 I hate persistent ass hairstylist like BITCHHHH if I don’t want oil in my hair don’t Fucking put it, I know wtf is good isn’t for my hair wtf

4380 2018-11-21 19:41:16 @Dove If your company is really about cruelty free and the welfare of animals why do your soaps contain palm oil?
4381 2018-11-21 19:41:15 I had to reread that multiple times trying to figure out what the heck “window oil” was
4382 2018-11-21 19:41:14 Just a reminder that the average price of oil in 2016, Obama’s final year as President was lower than any time including right now during trump. Remember, trump is a serial liar and a con man #crooks and liars. Obama’s energy policy was also good foreign policy.
4383 2018-11-21 19:41:10 40% of your oil comes from Canada, only 11% from Saudi Arabia. Check the stats
4384 2018-11-21 19:41:08 $40 oil on the way. Cost of production has been slashed so not as catastrophic as would have been. Still not good for North Sea.
4385 2018-11-21 19:41:03 saudi's are broke they will pump this oil at any price
4386 2018-11-21 19:41:02 Yes, Trump traded a person for oil prices. He’s openly said that he doesn’t want to hold MbS accountable for financial reasons. 

Your misinformation about Khashoggi is Saudi propaganda.

Your comparisons are ridiculous. Since when is that our standard for Presidential behavior?
4387 2018-11-21 19:41:02 Kinda like Socialism, which the left is now " reclaiming" asserting it really doesnt mean what it's meant since the mid 1900's? 
Or the word queer, which I'm old enough to remember was a pejorative.
If true, it's not, we have every right to reclaim the term

4390 2018-11-21 19:41:00 Common sense: Saudi Arabia are not running charity? Oil price has nothing to do with how Saudi runs their business!!!!!!!
4391 2018-11-21 19:41:00 Depends on vehicle and type of oil change. My truck 4.8 litre, semi synthetic is about a hundred bucks
4392 2018-11-21 19:40:54 #GivingTuesday is coming up y'all. Some top picks: @SavetheChildren (Yemen), @theIRC , and the Wilderness Society @Wilderness . Real change comes from our policies, but in the meantime, some $$$ will buy a meal, or help buy land to protect it from big oil & reckless development.
4393 2018-11-21 19:40:49 Canada  supplies 40 % of your oil. Saudi. 11%. Anything under $50 a barrel makes US & Canadian oil production too unprofitable. Saudis are dumping oil to put North American oil producers out of business so once again they can control the price of oil.
4394 2018-11-21 19:40:48 Says the borb who sweats cooking oil.
4395 2018-11-21 19:40:47 But they are! 

They cure cancer, the flu, allergies, epilepsy, insomnia, colds, sunburns, acne, broken bones, malaria, appendicitis, Alzheimers, headaches, flat tires, broken water heaters, and death (to name just a few). 

Got a problem? There's an oil for it.
4396 2018-11-21 19:40:46 It's the oil from American producers that is driving world oil prices down. Not Saudi Arabia.
4397 2018-11-21 19:40:46 Hi again, @PlantTherapy! This is my 1st year shopping with you for the upcoming Black Friday, and I was wondering can you use a Spotlight Oil of the Week code in conjunction with any possible deals you might be having? I was thinking of stocking up on some Frank 
4398 2018-11-21 19:40:45 Kill journalists all day just keep your oil prices low! SAUDI ARABIA FIRST!
4399 2018-11-21 19:40:43 Dropped my car off for my 12:00pm oil change appointment and they just now started it. K. Glad I just love wasting my life.
4400 2018-11-21 19:40:39 Take garlic powder or minced fresh garlic.. salt... Pepper... Clove if u have it... Mix... Add Olive or coconut oil til like paste... Apply to infected area. Nasty as shit but works like a freaking charm. I have a calcium deficiency my teeth crumble. Trust me on this
4401 2018-11-21 19:40:37 I had the same reaction. Shame on Trump for putting money over morality and oil over a life.
4402 2018-11-21 19:40:35 You don't seem to understand the first thing about economics. The Saudi oil is only 11% of what we import,  so Canada has a 4X effect on our prices than the Saudis.

Why are you grovelling to the Saudis? Do they have something on you?

4405 2018-11-21 19:40:31 Exactly! And let's not forget that gas was under $2 at times during Obama administration. Oil prices were so low under Obama, American fracking companies were filing bankruptcy or getting bought up by larger supplier's.
4406 2018-11-21 19:40:30 As the fascist oil conglomerating rules this fascist made President as did W. Bush's!!

4408 2018-11-21 19:40:27 @BrookeBCNN USA oil imports from Canada 40%.  From Saudi Arabia 11%. Saudi Arabia commits premeditated murder & gets a thank you. Canada gets tariffs. Huh? What is Trump really up to? Looking for future personal business deals perhaps.
4409 2018-11-21 19:40:24 I am sure all businesses are moving to renewables, what we all have to remember is all the people who invested in oil over the last 20 years want their money back. It's economically driven, oil is going to be here for a long time still.
4410 2018-11-21 19:40:23 You can criticise us as much as you like but we remain the goose that lays the Golden Egg and feeds this nation with our oil.
4411 2018-11-21 19:40:21 You know what surprise me the most?
ALL the stupid persons who liked your tweet.

Fun fact: Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
4412 2018-11-21 19:40:17 I realistically shouldn’t  my car needs an oil change and I don’t know with the big game this weekend if my brother would watch the dog

4414 2018-11-21 19:40:10 I think he lets it play out.  If they are putting together a string of wins, nothing’s going to change.
4415 2018-11-21 19:40:08 Syrians will find peace and stability without U.S. desructive help. U.S. must return what belongs to Syrians: the land (%30 !!!) and oil.

4419 2018-11-21 19:40:04 Are you going crazy or what America is now the largest oil lower prices only cut our own throat how many people in Texas do you want to put out of work good luck getting Reelected in 2020
4420 2018-11-21 19:40:04 I went passed a gas station and on Thanksgiving week it's 2.19. I looked at my dad and asked what country with crude oil did we invade.
4421 2018-11-21 19:40:03 You can criticise us as much as you like but we remain the goose that lays the Golden Egg and feeds this nation with our oil.
4422 2018-11-21 19:40:02 By unknowing them
4423 2018-11-21 19:39:58 I hope trump realizes that saudi arabia has been trying to raise the oil prices through opec production cuts....and his policy on Iran is actually putting upward pressure on oil prices.
4424 2018-11-21 19:39:56 Canada supplies 40% of your oil (Saudis: 11%). Also, we don’t murder journalists.
4425 2018-11-21 19:39:52 Hello there idiot
The majority of our oil comes from Canada. Only 11% comes from Saudi Arabia.
Saudis are undercutting US energy producers/glutting global market w/cheap oil. Like a bad tariff, they're forcing US to compete or shut wells. Lower SA oil prices are BAD for the US
4426 2018-11-21 19:39:48 @MaltesersUK palm oil is bad for your notoriety in France 
4427 2018-11-21 19:39:47 Keep oil prices up.
4428 2018-11-21 19:39:40 Do y’all prefer oil or lotion?
4429 2018-11-21 19:39:39 What’s 12 pints of journalist blood against a million barrels of Saudi oil?
4430 2018-11-21 19:39:37 That’s a long ass oil change !
4431 2018-11-21 19:39:33 Lies
Sheer lies
What do you mean by "stronger banking system"?
Was it not Sanusi Lamido who was bailing collapsing banks in 2009?

" None oil export grew by 24%"
What was Atiku exporting?
Faro water?

You gleefully quote Atikulooter, an unrepentant liar & want us to bliv?
Issokay
4432 2018-11-21 19:39:32 Who needs Saudi Arabia when Canada, our true friend and closer neighbor, can supply any oil we need ? Eh? Not everyone is as ignorant or selfish as you DT.
4433 2018-11-21 19:39:30 Given oil companies are going to commence shutting in production and there will be another wave of layoffs in the new year, flat is wildly optimistic.
4434 2018-11-21 19:39:28 There's a big difference between oil tankers and LNG tankers. If an oil tanker hits a reef the mess is terrible a la Exxon Valdez. If an LNG tanker hits a reef the worst result is a release into the atmosphere and maybe an explosion. Route out of Kitimat is manageable but tricky.
4435 2018-11-21 19:39:28 bitches always need a oil change and air in they tires 
4436 2018-11-21 19:39:26 I would rather you hold Saudi Arabia accountable for the murder of a journalist than crow about oil prices.  You are despicable.
4437 2018-11-21 19:39:22 The US only gets 11% of it's oil from Saudi Arabia and 40% from Canada. So why is Trump constantly slamming Canada?
4438 2018-11-21 19:39:21 @Reuters #Saudi #oil will #find it's #way onto the #world #market #regardless of circumstances. #Trumps #trade #war has #already wreaked #more #havoc on the #world #economy than misguided #weapons #transactions.
4439 2018-11-21 19:39:21 Unfortunately I can only now read it as “Common Bile Duct” Oil
4440 2018-11-21 19:39:13 he's deranged and he's a criminal it's the worst combination possible. He's in with the Saudis for something other than oil prices. I'm guessing weapons and gun sales?
4441 2018-11-21 19:39:13 Oil then plummeted to $33/bbl where huge fracking companies hedged production and put a bottom in oil.
4442 2018-11-21 19:39:10 Wouldn't be surprised if your right Stewie. But as a curious watcher of oil and oil related stocks today's price action felt rather different to me.
4443 2018-11-21 19:39:05 perfect mouth for a gas nozzle. filler up! the shape of oil prices 
4444 2018-11-21 19:39:03 The EU is banning single use plastics and palm oil in biofuels. 

Brexit threatens environmental progress. Fight it!
4445 2018-11-21 19:39:03 Lol you’re suppose to get an oil change every 3 mont......never mind smh
4446 2018-11-21 19:38:57 Yeah but it's crap political strategy.

He's almost publicly declaring that he's got a weak hand against Saudi Arabia.

The problem is, he's shown little regard for his relationship with Canada, which suggests he doesn't realize that's where the US ACTUALLY gets most of its oil.
4447 2018-11-21 19:38:55 America gets 40% of its oil from us ... from Canada ... and Mr. Trump never has a nice word to say about us. We've never slaughtered anyone in a consulate, ever.
4448 2018-11-21 19:38:53 What does it taste like... oil and eggs?
4449 2018-11-21 19:38:46 They tell them to keep off.
They will still not keep off from Nigerian Oil
4450 2018-11-21 19:38:45 I get that Cassandra, really do. But we have put ourselves dependant on them for years. I believe Trump is truly trying to ease US. oil so soon we won't have to deal with these bastards. But it will take a bit of time. Let him do his magic.
4451 2018-11-21 19:38:44 @Gidi_Traffic @nairaland @smhkontagora urgently in need of black oil. As much as 3million litres - particularly the one from the ship. Somebori help
4452 2018-11-21 19:38:37 Apparently...The USA gets more oil from Canada  that Saudi Arabia.    Think about that for a moment.
4453 2018-11-21 19:38:35 Saudi money is blood money. Saudi oil is nothing but blood.
4454 2018-11-21 19:38:33 Salt and pepper baby oil on the ready? Turbo Ice Blast tissues?
4455 2018-11-21 19:38:31 America say thanks to Saudi, such a pathetic. Keep on.
2020 oil prices will surprise America and the World.
4456 2018-11-21 19:38:30 BTC miners, not hedged, went bankrupt

Airlines, not hedged in 2008, went bankrupt when oil touched $147/bbl

If the bottom isn't right around here; then all of crypto will implode. We're standing on that line in the sand now.
4457 2018-11-21 19:38:28 I don't know if the oil industry profit is the bigger motive, or the profits of military contractors are the bigger profit motive. Obviously, it's both and it's all about the money.
4458 2018-11-21 19:38:25 Baking soda really does get coconut oil stains out of couches 
4459 2018-11-21 19:38:24 That's my specialty I will bring da Organic coconut oil 
4460 2018-11-21 19:38:24 Im gettin my oil changed & he rolled down the windows cus of the weed smellhe need to embrace it. Fuck that cigarette smell
4461 2018-11-21 19:38:24 Yes mate.The tides come in and out every day,twice a day guaranteed,the Romans knew it but it don’t feed the Oil Barons and them who supply their munitions.Nuclear take 50 yrs to plan and build.
Oil and pills then rations for the poor.
4462 2018-11-21 19:38:23 "If yo stroller takes an oil change, you need to figure something out" @LookAtDustin  @FriendZonePod
4463 2018-11-21 19:38:22 @realDonaldTrump praised #SaudiArabia for murder & low Oil prices and I think I just wished a #NativeAmerican #HappyThanksgiving
4464 2018-11-21 19:38:14 And getting my oil changed!!
4465 2018-11-21 19:38:11 Slice and roast them in a mix of oil and butter and some salt.
4466 2018-11-21 19:38:10 Tank you Saudi Arabia to kill Americain citizen with friend like that you don't need too many ennemysThe economy is so good it's why the Stock Market is so low must follow the prlce of the Oil.
4467 2018-11-21 19:37:57 Thank Canada. .Dakota. .Saudi Arabia oil..tiny bit of our oil market for U.S.
4468 2018-11-21 19:37:56 Great comment on Canadian oil. Note to Trump- canadians don’t kill journalists, bomb yemenis , or lend $ to grifter real estate developers. Maybe more Americans should pay attention to our great relationship, as you did as Ambassador.
4469 2018-11-21 19:37:54 Other cheap imports get tarrifs, but not cheap imported oil? Does he hate the US oil industry?
4470 2018-11-21 19:37:54 Yes condoning murderer and then saying how proud he is that we are getting oil at $52 a barrel instead of 85 what a piece of shit alive lost and he’s going to partner with them and think they’re going to actually lower the price it doesn’t work that way he’s such a idiot
4471 2018-11-21 19:37:51 #POTUS you spineless bastard, the Saudis kill Khashoggi, and all you can say is, well done to Saudi Arabia for producing more oil to get the price down. So much for a full investigation on his death
4472 2018-11-21 19:37:48 ... try going from the oil capital of Europe to the Highland capital.

4475 2018-11-21 19:37:45 The base is some ancient copper from the old school citadel metallics paint set (from the 90s). Wash with devlan mud, then nuln oil. Edge highlights are runelord brass.
4476 2018-11-21 19:37:41 Ah yes, I knew that stat was around.  Canada provides 40% of the oil that the USA imports.
4477 2018-11-21 19:37:39 you can pump Mr president don't worry ,we have oil for us and for you.......
4478 2018-11-21 19:37:38 just got into to my oil change and one of the workers is trying to be so smooth and hes like damn girl ur smile is beautiful, theres no way ur over 21, are you? like someone needs to get their abuelo over here at toyota
4479 2018-11-21 19:37:21 I am Iranian. I know more about the history of my country than what the media fed the American public. I won't go into detail, but removing Shah of Iran was a deliberate move by Carter. It was all about control over oil & it BACKFIRED. Shah kept Muslim Extremists under control.
4480 2018-11-21 19:37:20 Reuters "Oil prices tumbled more than 6 percent on Tuesday in heavy trading volume, with U.S. crude diving to its lowest level in more than a year, caught in a broader Wall Street selloff fed by mounting concerns about a slowdown in global economic growth."
4481 2018-11-21 19:37:19 You are aware that gas prices are about to fall because of an oil glut, right? So who's the idiot here? 
Should we allow the Saudi regime to kill journalists in the name of oil? What if that was your son who was a news reporter?
4482 2018-11-21 19:37:17 WE HAVEN’T RELIED ON OIL FROM SAUDI SINCE 1990’S!!GAS PRICES HAVE LOWERED FROM FRACKING!!NOT OKAY FOR ANYONE TO TORTURE/KILL AMERICAN JOURNALIST/U.S. RESIDENT/CITIZEN EVER!U.S. NEEDS TO PUT MAGNITSKY ACT & DEMAND MBS STEP DOWN IMMEDIATELY!!THEY NEED US  MORE THAN WE NEED THEM!!
4483 2018-11-21 19:37:15 What about Canada? Saudi only provides 11% of your oil, Canada provides 40%.
4484 2018-11-21 19:37:12 Is this genuine?  Absolute piss take if it is...... only been oil cunts for a day and look what's happened
4485 2018-11-21 19:37:03 More lies. We get 11% of our oil from Saudi Arabia...40% from Canada. And it hasn’t been $82 since 2014. #LiarInChief #WorstPresidentEver
4486 2018-11-21 19:37:01 The crown prince orders the brutal slaying of a legal US resident and you thank SA for phony oil numbers? You always become a wet noodle when other countries which you have personal interests in do something appalling.
4487 2018-11-21 19:36:59 Evidently, you do not realize that we get more oil from Canada than we do from the Saudis.  But we don't really expect you to know that little detail.
4488 2018-11-21 19:36:59 "canada" Second place for improving export sales was aluminum which gained 21.4%.

The oil seeds category posted the third-fastest gain up 9.5% year over year.

Two top categories retreated, namely vehicles (down -3.1%) and aircraft or spacecraft (down -5.8%).
4489 2018-11-21 19:36:55 Saudi Arabia ordered the murder of a US resident and here you are congratulating them over oil prices?  

You are disgusting.
4490 2018-11-21 19:36:46 They were, and they did, until Adolf attacked the USSR on his way to getting the oil wealth in Caucasia, with the ultimate aim of annexing India. Roosevelte sent Stalin steel via the back door, and the Russians stopped Hitler with it at Stalingrad.
4491 2018-11-21 19:36:44 So, I guess murder doesnt matter as long as they ply us with cheap oil.
4492 2018-11-21 19:36:43 The oil prices have gone up,, Dont know where Trump is getting his info,,
4493 2018-11-21 19:36:41 It is Canadian Oil that is allowing the low prices.  You know Trump lies about everything.
4494 2018-11-21 19:36:37 "canada" 
Mineral fuels including oil was the fastest-grower among Canada’s top 10 export categories, up 35.8% from 2016 to 2017 propelled by improved sales of both crude and refined petroleum oils as well as petroleum gas.

I
4495 2018-11-21 19:36:30 So, how many more American residents and citizens are you willing to sacrifice for lower oil prices? I’ll step up if it means that we can pay less for gas.
4496 2018-11-21 19:36:29 @realDonaldTrump only cares for his dropping oil prices and his murderous Saudi friends. They can keep their oil, we'll just go electric for all soon.
4497 2018-11-21 19:36:24 This isn't the first time.  Anytime Oil is involved, values have been sold.  It's just not as blatant in the past.
4498 2018-11-21 19:36:21 You bring the olive oil...
4499 2018-11-21 19:36:19 Fossil fuel is the problem. Lower oil prices are simply a sign of more enlightened leaders turning away from climate altering emissions. Join the party. There's plenty of room. #ImpossiblyStupidPresident #PeeBrain #ImpeachTrumpNow #Imprison45
4500 2018-11-21 19:36:19 the only way you kraft/Cadbury is to use something else not palm oil  mann up make a stand lead the way
4501 2018-11-21 19:36:09 It's been known for years that any oil spill here will have inadequate response & will likely never be cleaned up due to sea conditions, weather & availability of equipment. If we have a tanker accident, God forbid, the response time and the amount of equipment is sorely lacking.
4502 2018-11-21 19:36:05 How many people have we terrorized without SA's help? Does moral outrage go only one way for you. Maybe all the middle east should boycott sending oil to the west?

Grow up.
4503 2018-11-21 19:36:04 Two very different issues. This man wasn’t a refugee and wasn’t an immigrant.

If we want to talk about better practices, the US could do better by our indigenous people, such as not trying to build oil pipelines on their land or disenfranchising their votes like in ND.
4504 2018-11-21 19:36:02 Red Herring
Trump’s position in the matter has nothing to do with the price of oil
4505 2018-11-21 19:36:01 Oil prices dipping because global economy sucks due to trump economics.
4506 2018-11-21 19:36:01 and that's not the reason oil went down. Had nothing to do with Saudi Arabia
4507 2018-11-21 19:35:59 Better to piss off Canada, who supplies 40% of your oil, lying that we are a “threat to US security, than upset the Saudi’s who supply only 11%, and brutally murdered a legal US resident. Who’s stupid? Check a mirror.
4508 2018-11-21 19:35:57 This Amla oil comes rushing out the damn bottle ... now I got a hand full of this shit
4509 2018-11-21 19:35:53 <><> Il have to check in next time Im around there oooo
awghg thats sad :((( all iuntersting lflavours but cant eat ahh

really o_o never knew even pine oil was edible for us jhf sure will tho <><>
4510 2018-11-21 19:35:52 You can’t go lower than trading a man’s life for oil.
4511 2018-11-21 19:35:47 This is offset by low oil prices I read somewhere
4512 2018-11-21 19:35:47 "canada" Electrical machinery, equipment: $13 billion (3.1%)
Plastics, plastic articles: $12.6 billion (3%)
Aluminum: $9.8 billion (2.3%)
Aircraft, spacecraft: $9.7 billion (2.3%)
Oil seeds: $7.9 billion (1.9%)
4513 2018-11-21 19:35:45 สวยงามครับ
4514 2018-11-21 19:35:45 Musk would disagree with you. Why,  the higher oil prices the better stimuli for innovations,  in the first place in the energy and motor car industries. Not bad at all!
4515 2018-11-21 19:35:45 Saudi Arabia doesn’t control the price of oil.. the price you pay at the pump is decided by the world oil market !!

4516 2018-11-21 19:35:37 So would you support increasing the state’s investment in green energy and green tech? It would further diversify our state economy, better prepare us for the future, and ween the state budget off the oil/gas revenue.
4517 2018-11-21 19:35:33 Was that why you are looking the other way.  Sorry I would rather pay more for oil then support a murder. #yourajoke #cantwaittillyouhavenothing
4518 2018-11-21 19:35:29 "canada" Mineral fuels including oil: US$84.6 billion (20.1% of total exports)
Vehicles: $62.3 billion (14.8%)
Machinery including computers: $32.4 billion (7.7%)
Gems, precious metals: $18.6 billion (4.4%)
Wood: $14.1 billion (3.3%)
4519 2018-11-21 19:35:28 So, now the Saudi Prince gets a pass to assasinate a reporter or anyone he pleases by giving us discounts for their oil. What an oligarchy society we’re now living in.
4520 2018-11-21 19:35:26 They realize that they need to do the increase while the oil prices are dipping....
4521 2018-11-21 19:35:25 So I guess we know the answer to that age old question.. "what is a journalists life worth?"..... it is precisely 28 USD per barrel of Saudi Oil.
4522 2018-11-21 19:35:22 He is doubling down here as lower oil helps lower rates which helps higher stocks, without which he is F.
4523 2018-11-21 19:35:21 2 bricks of Shea butter just got delivered. I'm bout to cut it with Argon oil or Aloe or black castor oil & whip it.
4524 2018-11-21 19:35:17 All the while fucking over your honest, do-gooder, best friend and next door neighbour who s you and has absolutely all the oil and almost anything else you could possibly ever need, too.
4525 2018-11-21 19:35:17 totally ... US is now the Saudi Arabia of oil production, afaik
4526 2018-11-21 19:35:15 Hey maybe if you let Saudi Arabia kill a bunch more American people, oil may go down to $10 a barrel. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!!’
4527 2018-11-21 19:35:15 We don't celebrate that holiday in my house because it represents racism, sexism, xenophobia.  Instead we go out on the back porch and yell obscenities at Joseph Hazelwood and Standard Oil. Also, we watch football so we can strengthen our hate against the partriarchy. #Woke
4528 2018-11-21 19:35:14 What about the Clinton Assassins?  Should MbS cut off oil being exported to us because of the crimes the Clintons committed?  Khasshoghi was NOT a US Citizen and WAS a part of ISIS, but that gets lost in translation when your only motive is to take a swipe at POTUS.
4529 2018-11-21 19:35:13 Funny Trump doesn't mention that it will damage the American oil industry if the price goes below 50 or 55 bucks a barrel. Low oil prices have both positive and negative consequences.
4530 2018-11-21 19:35:09 You do understand that your buddy MSB ,the killer of journalists doesn’t set oil prices right?
#KashoggiMurder
4531 2018-11-21 19:35:03 Gas prices at Conn pumps are putting a hurting on CT residents. Oil has gone down to $52 a barrel. When are you going to try and help the people of CT out ?
4532 2018-11-21 19:34:58 @GasBuddyDan @globalnews @CBCNews @JustinTrudeau Vancouver gas went from 1.29/lt to 1.42 while oil is lowest ever. Cheapest in Alberta is $.92/lt.  Time for government to WITHDRAW all tax breaks given to oil companies!!  #ObviousGasGouging
4533 2018-11-21 19:34:56 Or: “Oil prices getting lower. Great! Please remember the brutal murder of Washington Post journalist #JamalKhashoggi every time you fill your gas tank. My tax scam didn't work, the national debt is now $21 trillion, so I am selling America out to Saudi Arabia! #ThanksgivingEve”
4534 2018-11-21 19:34:56 Wait, Saudi Arabia just reduced oil prices.
4535 2018-11-21 19:34:55 Nope, Canada does. We export 40% of oil to the US. Saudi only 10%.
4536 2018-11-21 19:34:53 حبيت ريحة ال Argan oil
4537 2018-11-21 19:34:44 The USA gets 11% of its oil from the Saudis. Canada is your #1 supplier by far, but don't thank us because we're not stupid enough to believe that we are responsible for oil prices.
4538 2018-11-21 19:34:38 LMAO, they want to arrange money for Christmas rice and oil 
4539 2018-11-21 19:34:38 Lower oil prices doesn’t really hurt many of them though
4540 2018-11-21 19:34:34 Disgraceful and heinous crime. We should stop not only selling weapons to Saudi Arabia, but stop importing oil from those satraps. We're feeding this war as we refuel each of our cars.
4541 2018-11-21 19:34:33 Les antis  gilets vous payer pas assez  cher  le gas oil .
4542 2018-11-21 19:34:32 The essential oil craze is killing me 
4543 2018-11-21 19:34:32 I've got a mother who takes regular weeks off to go to a closed centre to gargle on oil while walking through magic grass and to eat raw seeds lunches, so, yeah. Yeah, I get it.
4544 2018-11-21 19:34:28 Yes!  Let’s keep heating up the planet so that we can brag about cheap oil!  Great long term strategy, rake boy.
4545 2018-11-21 19:34:28 This isn’t good for oil rigs on the states:(
4546 2018-11-21 19:34:23 I just took a bath with peppermint oil and I feel amazing.
4547 2018-11-21 19:34:23 I'm watching my country's president get blackmailed by Saudis with lower oil prices, right before my eyes. Can we get any lower than oil for murder? I'm horrified.
4548 2018-11-21 19:34:17 Nice bogus oil move into "pit close".
4549 2018-11-21 19:34:16 If you believe in American first then let's just go to Saudi Arabia and take their fucking oil. We're stronger than any country in the world. By the way thank you for the tax cut I can pay my mortgage with gallons of gas.
4550 2018-11-21 19:34:16 He’s going in for Iran’s oil . Money power oil .. he’s trying to create a war with Iran ...
4551 2018-11-21 19:34:16 The irony is that the Saudis are NOT driving the gas prices down. It’s our own production of oil that is. We are the largest oil producer in the world. Trump is looking to his personal bottom line here, and he is a traitor who must be locked up.
4552 2018-11-21 19:34:15 I’ve tried the bio oil and I’ve not seen a difference, I’ll need to try the dark spot corrector, thank you x
4553 2018-11-21 19:34:13 Saudi only imports 11% of our oil, Canada 40%.   They obviously have something on you, just like Russia.  Another downward spiral for this great country under you and your #MAGA leadership.

4554 2018-11-21 19:34:07 Buying a new car and not selling my Jeep was the best and worst decision. Super cool having two cars but now they’re both due for an oil change at the same time. This must be what it’s like to have twins and to send them to college at the same time
4555 2018-11-21 19:34:06 Best thing I've found is crushing up the pain pill and jamming it into the tooth if it's a cavity, or pack it around the area that hurts, also clove oil I believe it's called works good
4556 2018-11-21 19:34:04 Again Trump is tweetong fake news. Confusing Brent and WTI prices - Brent a heavier and WTI  a light sweet oil if there is such a thing.. price was drive higher by Trump sanctions on Iraq. OPEC came in to increase production. Supply and demand issues and exoecting global slowdown
4557 2018-11-21 19:33:58 Was Trump’s shout out tweet to Saudi Arabia for low oil prices this am another brilliant strategy to preserve options?

Maybe it’s just enough that Khashoggi ‘s American children will be traveling cheaper now and saving on that extra bed they no longer need for their dead father.
4558 2018-11-21 19:33:58 Canada supplies 40 % of American imported oil. Very disrepectful.
4559 2018-11-21 19:33:56 His statement about SA being the reason oil is so low was just another lie that his followers will believe.
4560 2018-11-21 19:33:53 Common misconception...the largest market share of foreign oil comes from the neighbors up north—Canada!
4561 2018-11-21 19:33:52 It doesn’t matter if HHDL spends the oil income money on drilling HH2, or gives it to UKOG ALBA & DOR so they can give it back. 

There may be tax advantages in the later system. 
SS is the Chair of HHDL and UKOG.
4562 2018-11-21 19:33:52 The fuck is happening with Crude.

4563 2018-11-21 19:33:48 “Kill anyone you like anytime anywhere - just keep oil supplies high and prices low. Oh, and keep my financial interests now and in the future strong.
4564 2018-11-21 19:33:41 Aren’t we currently exporting oil?

Doesn’t the US get part of that $?

Aren’t we doing that to sell off before oil isn’t used anymore?

Isn’t cheaper gas at the pump costing us?
4565 2018-11-21 19:33:41 At what cost? Do you have some sort of agreement with Saudia Arabia stating that you will let them torture and murder our citizens and press for cheap oil? Shame on you!
4566 2018-11-21 19:33:37 Even shale oil producers might break-even at the "high 50s" but a no one wants a low price regime especially Nigeria. And to think there were predictions of reaching $90/barrel  before the end of the year
4567 2018-11-21 19:33:29 Typical dumping of oil into the 2:30 close;   what a crooked market $CL_F $USO
4568 2018-11-21 19:33:21 North Sea oil is running out 
4569 2018-11-21 19:33:20 you can just feel the desperation among the $AMRN shorts  on biotwitter.... path of least resistance is $25 in near term... short covering, acknowledgment of mkt potential, mineral oil silliness..... love it
4570 2018-11-21 19:33:17 None of that he can say “I’ll bring the oil”
4571 2018-11-21 19:33:15 Gas prices are still going up in my area. But I'd happily pay more if it means holding Saudi Arabia accountable for murdering a US permanent resident and journalist. But this isn't about oil prices; Trump and Kushner receive personal benefits from SA so they can't criticize them.
4572 2018-11-21 19:33:13 Had this once in palm oil stew with rice and beans, e make sense
4573 2018-11-21 19:33:13 The price of oil is up $18 from 2 years ago, you ijit.
4574 2018-11-21 19:33:09 No it’s not. She asked for proof of voter suppression, I gave it to her. At this point you’re not even arguing that I didn’t . Now you’re goal post move is “i don’t see them as related.” You’re floundering dude. Thanks for admitting I did what was asked though.
4575 2018-11-21 19:33:04 This is so ridiculous! I heard it this morning and my jaw dropped. He said it’s because we would lose trade with them. Really? Big oil must have fingers in this one.
4576 2018-11-21 19:33:01 Is there any Oil on Mars? #AskNASA @NASAJPL
4577 2018-11-21 19:33:01 Liar. My heating oil went up $72 a month this year.
4578 2018-11-21 19:32:59 Oil for a soul price is to high
4579 2018-11-21 19:32:57 You don’t even know who we trade with! We get 11% of our oil from the Saudis and 40% from Canada. Hardly enough for Saudi to make such an impact.
4580 2018-11-21 19:32:48 Undoubtedly @Cadburyuk has robbed the Orangutans an many species of their natural habitats, forcing them into conflict leading to their deaths. You are culpable @CadburyUK 
Why can't you be like @DevineChocolate they manage it without palm oil, with faitrade -nicer chocolate too!
4581 2018-11-21 19:32:45 Sir get your facts right!You re twisting the news! Yes Nigeria needs to divest. But Russia actually wanted to enter into an MoaU with OPEC nations on how to strengthen their cooperation and better regulate the oil market. So twistin it the other way to suit your narrative is wrng
4582 2018-11-21 19:32:42 JHDJH WHERE DID YOU SEE THEM? or brand? jhf Im curious but havent seen anything <><

ajhgd doubt theyre even made with pine oil tbh? assuming
4583 2018-11-21 19:32:38 Canada supplies the US with most of its oil
4584 2018-11-21 19:32:27 I got my oil changes and still feel funny vibrations. Maybe it’s the coils.
4585 2018-11-21 19:32:25 The oil price isnt even directly attributable to saudi anywhere. Usa gets a small percentage of their oil from them
4586 2018-11-21 19:32:24 Oil cap flew off my car today and has been replaced with a sock this is my life
4587 2018-11-21 19:32:23 Do you ever get so nervous you cover yourself in coconut oil?
4588 2018-11-21 19:32:22 Every once in a while we actually agree on something
4589 2018-11-21 19:32:17 No Jim, its about cheaper oil prices and empty promises of investment. Life is pretty cheap to this President
4590 2018-11-21 19:32:14 it's the reason why a small fraction of our GDP should not be the element that jeopardizes the fiscal climate and the executive arm should be introspective on how it sets it's oil benchmark. Hopefully December 6, OPEC comes with an agreement that can boost prices.
4591 2018-11-21 19:32:09 15 of 19 9-11 hijackers were Saudis. This isn’t about our oil prices. It’s about your pocket book. You’re a traitor overlooking a murdered journalist to make blood money.
4592 2018-11-21 19:31:57 Last week Saudi Arabia tried to get OPEC to cut production to raise the price of oil. If it were up to the Saudi's they would double the price of oil. STFU.
4593 2018-11-21 19:31:54 That's a lie, you get more of your oil from your old friend Canada,  you maybe be benefiting personally from Saudi money, but that's not REALLY why your president.... is it??!!
4594 2018-11-21 19:31:43 Donald Trump just celebrated $54 per barrel oil. You won't hear that celebration from the Oklahoma legislature. If it goes low and stays low, the $450 million in the Rainy Day Fund won't last long. Just something to talk about at Thanksgiving Dinner.
4595 2018-11-21 19:31:41 Listen they have already got pipes taking the oil out of the North Sea and into England so they can kid on it not coming out of Scotland water thieves springs to mind
4596 2018-11-21 19:31:35 The dog in the oil change place is only letting the men pet it. Im offended
4597 2018-11-21 19:31:32 I need to get my oil changed.
4598 2018-11-21 19:31:25 I survived an oil change and the grocery store! I also squeezed in time to watch the new is Doctor Who episode. Who’s the real winner?
4599 2018-11-21 19:31:24 And with oil prices tanking...?
4600 2018-11-21 19:31:23 Super excited to have Print Three Kingston Kingston Olive Oil Company Heelboy and Avenue Florist barrier-free!!  Ramp delivery will be happening by the end of the month!! #accessiblekingston #cityofkingston #downtownkingston
4601 2018-11-21 19:31:23 You might be stupid and think we're as dumb as you but that's not the case doofus..Canada is our biggest supplier of imported oil, 40%, compared to 11% from Saudi Arabia.
4602 2018-11-21 19:31:18 Our staunch friends and allies: hereditary despots stealing their people's oil money. #c4news
4603 2018-11-21 19:31:14 I read that we get 40% of our oil from Canada.  The Groper vilifies the Canadians.
4604 2018-11-21 19:31:13 Our relationship with the Saudis is complicated.  One of the things that helps prop up the US dollar despite our dept is that Saudi sells their oil in US currency.  Imagine what would happen to the worth of the dollar if we pissed the Saudis off and they switched to rubies?
4605 2018-11-21 19:31:12 Donnie, supply and demand #economics101 slowing demand for oil #Trumponomics #Scaravan #WhatInvasion #Invasion What about the Invasion #BorderStunt
4606 2018-11-21 19:31:11 The two games they’ve won since McD/Drai have been together they have both had 3 points both games. If they’re not going the Oil don’t stand a chance. Need to be split up. I’d go Nuge/Drai McD/whoever. Wouldn’t mind seeing JP somewhere in that top 6.
4607 2018-11-21 19:31:10 Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, Saudi Arabia only gives us 11%.
4608 2018-11-21 19:31:08 May wish. It’s also interesting how you’re now attempting to Chang e the conversation to something wholly unrelated to what we are actually y’all about, which is voter suppression.
4609 2018-11-21 19:31:03 Lower! This is bad news for oil production and oil companies everywhere. #Oil #oilprices #oilandgas #ukog #angs
4610 2018-11-21 19:30:57 But they aint coal miners, right? Drump didn't say anything about oil rig workers, he is only interested in coal miners. I bet he doesn't even know what the hell a "Coal miner" or an "oil industry worker" is.
4611 2018-11-21 19:30:55 You want cheap oil and a robust US economy or not? The two go hand in hand. Besides how many people get murdered and hacked up by other govt's, including ours every single day?
4612 2018-11-21 19:30:54 Does anyone remember when gas prices were low & then oil companies/stock market started increasing the price because of the wars hurting production, weather, general worrying? Yet none of the things they were worried about ever happened yet gas prices never dropped back down? 
4613 2018-11-21 19:30:52 Hate to tell you but we get way more oil from Canada than SA. Most of our oil is now domestic so that argument is invalid. We have lost our morality as a country and Trumpsters dont care at all.
4614 2018-11-21 19:30:51 mann, black castor oil takes pisses me offf it take sooo long to come out the bottle BUT WHEN YOU DROP IT your entire bottle be gone within second, this oil already cost to damn much ,  i be ready to beat my own ass 
4615 2018-11-21 19:30:49 Na here I go see you .. I want oil perfume o! 
4616 2018-11-21 19:30:48 It is sad, and it’s a moral dilemma. We get so much wealth from arms sales and benefits from oil trade, should we give that up for one life? It’s not as easy of a question as it may seem (if you’re understanding what mean)
4617 2018-11-21 19:30:46 You should.
You are inservice for Trump. Trump order and you obey!
Decrease oil price.
Pay more...
4618 2018-11-21 19:30:46 Bahut suna tha.. lkn bilkl bhi acha nhi lga..paranthe mein taste kum oil jyda hota hai .. dubara kbhi nhi jaaongi 
4619 2018-11-21 19:30:43 This steel rear end housing and engine oil pan and aluminum transmission oil pan were brought in to be polished and brass plated. As a classic car enthusiast, I'm really looking forward to seeing them installed to share with everyone!
- Sam
4620 2018-11-21 19:30:36 cleaned my car out, did laundry, and finally changed my oil and i still have 2 and half hours to spare before i have to be to work how lovely 
4621 2018-11-21 19:30:33 The Saudis were the ones who ran the price of oil up to what it was by cutting back on production. The price of oil is determined by the world market not by the Saudis. We only get about 10% of our oil/gas from them.  We get more from Canada. We are essentially self sufficient.
4622 2018-11-21 19:30:32 wet hail is coming down. Hmmmm... shower or oil my body and feet?

4624 2018-11-21 19:30:30 Oh POTUS, such fake news.  Canada is your largest of supplier of oil.  You're welcome!
4625 2018-11-21 19:30:23 They also get put into power when they have no reason to be. Scott Pruitt doesnt think the EPA should even exist yet he ended up being appointed as its administrator to help the interests of big oil. These people will do anything for profits, even ruin our climate.
4626 2018-11-21 19:30:20 The Saudis did it but apparently oil is more important than justice... 

Some.fucking.ass.president you are bitch @realDonaldTrump 

You’re the enemy of state asshole.
4627 2018-11-21 19:30:15 Gas prices should Never dictate policy...it has helped destroy our environment. We need clean solutions. I would prefer paying more BUT using less of it. Oil Industry is the .
4628 2018-11-21 19:30:10 So I was hitting my juul long story short I lost a dab in my car last week & im guessing this morning when my juul fell between my seat ( the death hole ) as I’m hitting my juul I’m like WHY THE FUCK MY HAND SO STICKY BITCH I HAVE OIL EVERYWHERE . Found that dab .
4629 2018-11-21 19:30:10 This talk of gerrymandering, while NVR disclosing they do it also amplifies a general conception of R voter suppression.  Actually unrelated. R,s have made every concession, free ID, free ride to get ID and yet dems cry foul. This subject is totally unrelated
4630 2018-11-21 19:30:10 As an American. I truly apologize for this embarrassment @realDonaldTrump I for one know the many great things Canada has done for my country. After 9-11 y’all were there and you also supply us with way more oil than #SaudiArabia 
RC
4631 2018-11-21 19:30:09 Nationalism isn’t a synonym for patriotism. In fact if you look it up in the dictionary, the synonyms listed for nationalism are “jingoism, xenophobia, flag waving”. None of those have positive connotations, just like nationalism has meant fascism since 1945, no matter what you
4632 2018-11-21 19:30:06 Perhaps that's why Trump is trying to increase the oil in this country so we can be done with Arabian oil
4633 2018-11-21 19:30:04 OUR JOURNALIST KNEW SOMETHING THAT WAS VERY DANGEROUS TO EXPOSE. DT IS INVOLVED. DAMN THE OIL. WE AMERICANS ARE IN TROUBLE HAVING DT AS CIC.
4634 2018-11-21 19:30:03 Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes.. Drizzle oil
4635 2018-11-21 19:30:01 Thank you for posting this Financial Post article.
I think the elder Pierre Trudeau was a bright guy whose take on Alberta oil was draconian. I may not agree with his policies, I still respect him as PM. His son Justin Trudeau though is an ignorant, incompetent virtue signaller.
4636 2018-11-21 19:29:54 Saudi Arabia provides 11% of our oil, for comparison Canada provides 40% 
Also the US has tons of oil reserves
4637 2018-11-21 19:29:49 Unfortunately just like you, oil markets can be easily manipulated.
4638 2018-11-21 19:29:49 Americans can exist without Saudi oil. You are moonlighting as PR consultant for Saudi oil. U.S. needs lower costs for affordable care and prescription drugs. Expect lower poll numbers for defending MBS, Putin and Kim Jung-Un.  Say goodbye to 2020 elections.
4639 2018-11-21 19:29:49 Gracious ba mo chekile oil and she ubered the dude.  #TheQueenMzansi
4640 2018-11-21 19:29:48 Oil prices getting lower is not good thing.  When companies get slow or lay off, oil and gas ppl quit spending money which helps the economy.
4641 2018-11-21 19:29:47 Currently getting my oil change and a guy 2 chairs down from me is blasting the jackson 5
4642 2018-11-21 19:29:45 Correct.  But everyone knew that before anyone went out there looking for oil.
4643 2018-11-21 19:29:35 OPEC meet 6th Dec to lift oil price.
Ignoring a murder in Istanbul will have no effect.End of cheap oil.
4644 2018-11-21 19:29:32 Anyone else has vibes that his #taxscam sugar induced "economy" may not last much longer? 
Price of oil is just a timeout in front of inevitable correction that most likely will take place in stock market. 
Be not afraid though. Stock market is just one part of economy.
4645 2018-11-21 19:29:30 Selling my Camry SE 2015, less than 50k miles. In very good condition. Well maintained, always use Toyota dealer for oil change.

Additional options:
Toyota installed remote starter
Hood paint protection
Moon roof
All weather mats
4646 2018-11-21 19:29:25 like the way oil paint was incorporated into it mate
4647 2018-11-21 19:29:25 And the USA only getes 11% of its oil from Saudi Arabia, you get 40% of it from us friendly Canucks next door.  Hi, BTW 
4648 2018-11-21 19:29:21 Does “The Gentleman’s Beard Growth Oil” really work? I’m tryin see something 
4649 2018-11-21 19:29:13 I'd say it's a move in the right direction. IF the Oil are truly going to "get it right" with Lucic they will raise his value(hopefully by keeping him in this role). And 1st chance they get they move mountains(and draft picks) to rid themselves of this player and the $6 Mill Cap.
4650 2018-11-21 19:29:07 Perhaps when they kill someone else they will drop the price of oil again
4651 2018-11-21 19:29:06 X President Obama talk like sake oil saleman take there an carpet bagger talk his bull an take there money !
4652 2018-11-21 19:28:49 Vegans defending the horrible palm oil industry and repeating its arguments on self-certification being the solution is what's wrong with veganism today. It was supposed to be about preventing harm to animals within our possibilities, remember?
4653 2018-11-21 19:28:47 Canada supplies America with more oil than Saudi.
4654 2018-11-21 19:28:34 A lot of the oil in the South comes from South America has nothing to do with the Saudis
4655 2018-11-21 19:28:31 Mumcy found out our neighbour has a cat, her face was looking like binding and casting with a side of anointing oil
4656 2018-11-21 19:28:31 Don’t forget your ok with Saudi Arabia killing people who disagree with the prince. Oil prices are low because the US oil industry is kicking ass. We don’t need the Saudi’s, only Trump needs the Saudi’s to build hotels and golf courses.
4657 2018-11-21 19:28:27 But - But - why do we need to purchase the Saudi oil when our country is producing to much now?
4658 2018-11-21 19:28:23 1.5 hrs to US market close:

4659 2018-11-21 19:28:21 I’m offended by the headline. The Saudi’s aren’t pumping oil to help us. They’re doing it because they need money. It’s a global market. Prices are set by supply and demand.
4660 2018-11-21 19:28:18 What a powerful President!  All it took to bring us to our knees was the fear of oil prices rising...for killing a journalist!
4661 2018-11-21 19:28:17 Ohh the body shop! I should check that one out! I haven't had great success with the burts bees preventing flakiness? I think what I want is like a lip oil without any additives but those don't seem to exist :/
4662 2018-11-21 19:28:15 THAT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD WHEN OIL PRICES GET LOW, I AGREE, BUT IF THEY GO TO LOW IT COULD CAUSE A MAJOR CALAPSE OF THE ENTIRE OIL INDUSTRY WHICH WILL PUT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS OUT OF WORK AND WILL MAKE YOUR SAUDI PRINCES AND YOUR OFF SHORE MONEY TREE NEXT TO NOTHING!
4663 2018-11-21 19:28:07 That’s the excuse you used for allowing MBS to get away with murder. By the way most of our oil comes from Canada.
4664 2018-11-21 19:28:06 so because of oil a life is now worth nothing??..you are a fool.i hope someone kills u for fun.
4665 2018-11-21 19:27:55 Oh yea girl . I work at All Virgin Hair (a weave boutique) but yea you’re right natural hair products arent good for weaves cause it’s not on your scalp. I would just recommend a tiny bit of oil & water if you have hair with some type of curl pattern
4666 2018-11-21 19:27:54 while we struggle to come up with an acceptable Brexit deal and enjoying the incredibly high prices we pay for oil..
4667 2018-11-21 19:27:49 @sardesairajdeep Sir, amid all the other controversies in our Great COUNTRY around CBI vs SC, Sabrimala, RBI vs Govt, Polls in CG, J&K issues.. have you missed that crude oil prices have declined by 30% whereas Petrol/Diesel prices have been declined by ONLY 10%
4668 2018-11-21 19:27:46 Yes, go lower and all the American oil jobs will evaporate..... that means disappear.....ask your Sec. of State....please!!!
4669 2018-11-21 19:27:42 So you value Oil cost and the lining of #45 personal pocket over an American life??
4670 2018-11-21 19:27:35 I guess we're ignoring the fact that we only get 11% of our oil from SA? 
#ThanksCanada
4671 2018-11-21 19:27:33 British academic gets life in uae...  it’s a direct insult to Britain coming from the middle east reminding Britain that it’s a weak player in the world now, mean while Trump gives Saudi Arabia the thumbs up thanking them graciously for their extremely low oil prices
4672 2018-11-21 19:27:28 THEYD LOOK LIKE AN OIL PAINTING
4673 2018-11-21 19:27:24 Here’s some #wednesdaywisdom for you: keep your wooden cutting boards fresh and splinter-free by using mineral oil and lemon juice every month! #studentlife
4674 2018-11-21 19:27:16 Pretty sure it's the hemp oil. 
4675 2018-11-21 19:27:13 People complaining about Trump’s choice on the Saudí Arabia situation don’t seem to understand the global oil market.  However, that still doesn’t make it the right thing to do (morally)
4676 2018-11-21 19:27:13 Congrats on supporting this guy, oil workers of western North Dakota. He celebrates your demise.
4677 2018-11-21 19:27:12 I see y’all getting oil changes before going home to see ya dad
4678 2018-11-21 19:27:08 Yes and of course murdering people in the #UEA is ok as long as the oil price comes down.. well done #Trump on showing your true stance. #shameful
4679 2018-11-21 19:27:04 Canada's "world class oil spill response" doesn't even make an attempt to account for environmental losses?
4680 2018-11-21 19:27:03 Wouldn’t that wreck the oil field though? Couple counties around me are completely dependent on the oil field. Taxes pay most of the counties needs. When oil gets low it’s bad for their economy

4683 2018-11-21 19:26:57 Why not produce our own oil from plants and vegetables naturally, refine it and store it ourselves and We won't have to pay another country for theres? No more war over oil, No more paying by the barrel and hopefully no more oil spills in our oceans. = Independent  America.
4684 2018-11-21 19:26:52 Trump is lying, AS USUAL, by taking credit for falling oil prices. It's due to oversupply from many producers and falling demand due to the worldwide economic slowdown.
4685 2018-11-21 19:26:50 Wasn’t hearing oil up 3con the day like an hour ago?
4686 2018-11-21 19:26:49 Credit for what?  It’s not like he had anything to do with this.  The Saudis control oil prices completely independent of anything Trump does.
4687 2018-11-21 19:26:48 I assume you don't drive or if you do you are just too ignorant to understand how the price of oil matters to those not born rich. Like everyone who works for the @AustralianLabor high command.
4688 2018-11-21 19:26:48 Hi Tracy. Since 2015, we have sourced 100% of our palm oil for our own-label food products from sustainable RSPO-certified sources. We are on track to ensure that 100% of palm oil for our own brand non-food products is sourced from RSPO certified sources by the end of 2018.
4689 2018-11-21 19:26:47 Why this shit? USA doesn't need Saudi oil. In fact it could become totally self-sufficient today if they embraced alternative energies. But of course that wouldn't please the Kochs or Mercer....
4690 2018-11-21 19:26:40 The comment about Saudi Arabia causing low gas prices is purely misdirection. Canada provides 40% of US imported oil, Saudi Arabia 11%. He is using a fictional premise to bolster support for his stance on the killing.
4691 2018-11-21 19:26:40 low oil prices will have an impact on every CDN household. One less French university impacts just a few. One could even argue that royalties from oil would help to build and fund schools and hospitals across  This gov is playing politics with this issue to gain votes in Quebec
4692 2018-11-21 19:26:39 Nothing except total condemnation of the evil regime in Saudi Arabia should be tweeted by you. No amount of oil or money can redeem you or them.
4693 2018-11-21 19:26:38 He needs a vape of CBD oil 
4694 2018-11-21 19:26:36 America has significance oil reserves. Canada has vast oil fields. Not to mention Venezuela & Russia. Enough said.
4695 2018-11-21 19:26:34 Blood for oil
4696 2018-11-21 19:26:34 I support @POTUS but cheap oil=those good oil industry jobs disappear. We profit at a lower price/bbl than SA, RU or Iran, but $70-$80/bbl supports jobs and keeps fuel high enough to spur research for alternatives. You need to know this. #MAGA hurt energy=hurt #USA

4699 2018-11-21 19:26:29 So let me get this right, you want Americans to value oil prices over the life of an American??
4700 2018-11-21 19:26:28 Nah, Nutella has twice as much hazelnut as cocoa, and is mainly sugar and palm oil. Meaning total BS.
4701 2018-11-21 19:26:23 Would love that because that would make us no. 1 oil producer. Yea
4702 2018-11-21 19:26:22 oil will never run out. it was not produces  by fossils, but from amino acids formed on charged potentials in salt water by binding oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen to a carbon atom, COHN. it's a LIE
4703 2018-11-21 19:26:17 We *need*.... And also, with oil prices being low, you don't see any significant savings at the pump anyway, it's not as strong a correlation as it used to be.
4704 2018-11-21 19:26:10 Technically, no. He was here legally which afforded him the full rights of a U.S. Citizen. He went to Indiana State. Reagan would have reacted very differently than Dumbo even though we were dependant on them for oil, unlike now
4705 2018-11-21 19:26:09 Fact is the Saudi's are not our friends. We are their oil customer that's it.
They are a brutal, heartless and a repressive absolute dictatorship, They care nothing for the American people except our money.
It is way past time for American people to face that undeniable reality.
4706 2018-11-21 19:26:06 The Robots in Disguise oil tanker version of Scourge/Nemesis Prime is the best version don’t @ me
4707 2018-11-21 19:25:59 Between 2010 - 2015 that Jonathan was President, despite the massive OIL BOOM that Government benefited from, our National DEBT incurred was $28.8Billion. 

And between 2015 - 2018, under PMB, our DEBT rose by $9.2Billion. You can excuse GEJ but PMB must be CRUCIFIED!

4708 2018-11-21 19:25:54 As oil prices continue to FALL !! Good for America people, ya know !!
4709 2018-11-21 19:25:54 You buy 40% of your oil from Canada and only 11% from Saudi
4710 2018-11-21 19:25:51 Saudi Arabia tried to get OPEC to cut production last week in order to raise the price of oil. What does that tell you.
4711 2018-11-21 19:25:50 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
4712 2018-11-21 19:25:38 Several reasons I suspect including More efficient plants/scale economies; better risk management and getting maximum revenue potential from co-products--DDGS and #corn oil.

4714 2018-11-21 19:25:31 The US gets less than 15% of its oil from Saudi Arabia, why hasn’t 45 thanked the other nations the USA is dependent upon for our oil? Has anyone explained those facts to him yet? I didn’t think so.
4715 2018-11-21 19:25:28 And LA had streetcars. Unfortunately, they were not publicly owned. The companies were bought by Goodyear and an oil company, I believe, then promptly put out of business. Oil and tire companies needed more customers. The car-ification of So Cal was not a consumer-led process.
4716 2018-11-21 19:25:25 Oil War, Contain of Iran, and Personal Vendetta against Sadam Hussein for alleged attempt on G. H. W. Bush's life. Yet, IC did not push back on quality of Intel nor decision making. ~3.5K US killed, 25K wounded, $2Trillion spent that could be used on debt or domestic priorities.
4717 2018-11-21 19:25:24 By lowering and cheering on the lower price oil he is putting the majority of oilfield workers out of work. A much bigger group than steel and coal workers who he says he is helping.
4718 2018-11-21 19:25:19 Stop selling them weapons, stop buying their oil, sanction their banking transactions, prosecute those found responsible.

This nonsense that we somehow need Saudi Arabia is dangerous.
4719 2018-11-21 19:25:16 Cbd oil (sublingually) has helped my hormonal acne a lot!
4720 2018-11-21 19:25:13 Starting to get any better, or ramping up? Whatever's going around this year has started clearing up a oil, for me
4721 2018-11-21 19:25:11 Yeah they dumped oil prices 50% that caused a downward spiral. The currency was already in a bad shape because of the isolation.
4722 2018-11-21 19:25:10 POTUS doesn’t sound like he believes CIA. Does he have conflicting military intel? Smells like a setup from get go. Why would Saudis off one of their own (rogue agent?) for the world to see? Should we sanction 2nd largest oil producer (petro $) over a nobody? #WWG1WGA

4725 2018-11-21 19:25:06 How much American oil is from Saudi Arabia and how much from Canada??
4726 2018-11-21 19:25:05 You know you're comparing a price high in Brent crude vs current price of WTI crude don't you? A bit like saying "apples are now less expensive than soy beans" and by the way, oil has fallen largely because of the boom in US shale output. Saudi Arabia is planning TO CUT output
4727 2018-11-21 19:25:02 We get 41% of oil from Canada.   Saudi Arabia has supported price increases and reduced production to inflate costs.  They are not our friends
4728 2018-11-21 19:24:55 You need to thank Canada, we get 40% of our oil imports from THEM, only 11% from murdering Saudis.  But of course you are in the Saudis pocket so you have to thank your landlord
4729 2018-11-21 19:24:52 @realDonaldTrump Global and national protests will take place in Iran when Iran's oil exports reach zero. There is no other way
4730 2018-11-21 19:24:52 Ah yes the murder of an American reporter is totally worth the lower lower oil prices. Should be calling it blood oil.

4738 2018-11-21 19:24:35 If Germany had oil, would FDR have made such a tweet in 1940?
4739 2018-11-21 19:24:32 Um the US gets 40% of its oil from Canada and only 11% from Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, the notion that Russia, a net energy exporter (literally almost their entire economy is dependent on oil and natural gas) is going to swoop in and buy Saudi oil if the US sanctions it is lunacy
4740 2018-11-21 19:24:31 Except it does NO ONE any good except for oil companies. It means THEY get to pocket more while ripping US off. Oh, and let's talk about the destruction of our planet.

Oh wait, you don't give a shit.

4747 2018-11-21 19:24:14 Nice video Jennifer. Yes people just love that oil.
4748 2018-11-21 19:24:13 Literally billions of private and public sector dollars are invested in green energy every year yet oil demand is still 100mm bpd and rising. The world still needs fossil fuels for the foreseeable future.  Either it comes from Canada or from some oppressive regime.
4749 2018-11-21 19:24:12 What did it take a murder to lower oil .and is this how ask they ask for forgiveness!

4752 2018-11-21 19:24:00 Like Nationalism and Patriotism? 
Or perversion of illegal aliens, immigrant, migrant? 
Nationalism is the opposite of transnationalism =globalism. 
Liberals distort language to confuse, the purpose of which is to define meaning with precision.
4753 2018-11-21 19:23:58 @realDonaldTrump Read the comments. Please dont expect common Democrats to understand the Petro dollar, & the decades long precedent of the US dollar being mandatory globally, to purchase oil. You need to break it down for the low IQ. They dont understand the significance of SA.
4754 2018-11-21 19:23:57 Actually sir, oil@prices sre@low due to American production increase which began under the @BarackObama administration #truth #truthhurts
4755 2018-11-21 19:23:56 Never tried an oven bag (especially after hearing horror stories about turkeys turning out like the one in National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation).

My fave method for juicy, mouth-watering T: butter, olive oil & herb mixture under the skin (and on the outside) before roasting.
4756 2018-11-21 19:23:56 You do know, don't you, that no president influences gas prices? And that only a fraction of our oil comes from the Middle East?

4758 2018-11-21 19:23:54 Do it yourself, bud. Way cheaper... I'd assume. Idk how much oil is up there
4759 2018-11-21 19:23:53 Don’t tell hi@ that ffs. He’ll put a tariff on our oil to protect the Saudi’s interests.
4760 2018-11-21 19:23:51 To get Nigeria working again all hand must be on desk, economy has been drooping & things have bcome more expensive, price of oil is killing a lot of progress.

4763 2018-11-21 19:23:43 If anyone did actual research, they would realize that the cost reduction is because of Alberta oil, and has nothing to do with Saudi Arabia. Just more Trump lies to fuel his base.

4767 2018-11-21 19:23:25 Is that why we haven't seen the middle class tax cut trump said we were going to get, cuz oil prices came down for a bit and trump considers that a tax cut?

By that thinking the increase in prices on about everything else should be considered a tax hike? Gee, thanks trump. Ass!

4770 2018-11-21 19:23:19 A THREAD: 

WHY OIL WAS THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THE IRAQ WAR
4771 2018-11-21 19:23:18 Saudi oil is just pumped up from large reservoirs while American oil is largely produced from fracking shale oil.  Look it up!
4772 2018-11-21 19:23:16 OPEC not what it was as a cartel & price setter but SA announced - before this week’s wave of uncertainty roiling markets/oil prices etc - their intention to cut production and raise oil prices. Now Trump thanks them for killing journalist - sorry, meant to say cutting prices...
4773 2018-11-21 19:23:14 Ran outta oil today no delivery till sat house is fucking Baltic the cold gets right into your bones how people live on streets is beyond me God love them 
4774 2018-11-21 19:23:13 Saudi money, Saudi oil. I still remember 9/11 and Saudi pilots.
4775 2018-11-21 19:23:12 Lower would start to be a bad thing as the oil companies wouldn't profit thus they stop drilling. Sure lower energy bills are great but I don't see it falling more and staying there. 

Honestly why not more investment into green energy?
4776 2018-11-21 19:23:08 In the language of his followers @realDonaldTrump is a beta cuck for Saudi royalty, their oil and precious weapons funding.

Motherfucker can't even put a real American first.  He's too busy bitching about his image in the press to stand up for the first amendment.

What a loser!
4777 2018-11-21 19:23:07 Yes but Canada does not have control over oil prices like the Saudi's. Canada sells by the price set by the Saudi's and other Arab nations. Nice try but a fail as a trump insult
4778 2018-11-21 19:23:00 Drink water.
Lather your skin in coconut oil.

4780 2018-11-21 19:22:52 Came here for an oil change and just spent $100 
4781 2018-11-21 19:22:46 America’s business & security interests have little or nothing to do with how much oil the Saudis put on the international market. The US, more than anyone, now controls the incremental difference in world oil supply. What is the real reason Trump is running point for the Saudis?
4782 2018-11-21 19:22:44 If economic self-interest trumps bad behavior dropkick KSA and open relations with Iran. They can off set any drop in Saudi oil production and you gain a marketplace of 80 million people for American goods and services...or does that make too much sense?
4783 2018-11-21 19:22:41 I think he has personal financial interests and he is using oil as an excuse. Because that’s how he rolls
4784 2018-11-21 19:22:41 Lots fish, avocado, fatty meats, coconut oil as a percentage of diet - * but not such that you take in excessive calories ! * 
Replacement of other calories is the key. Also exercise great for this.
4785 2018-11-21 19:22:40 Thank  God  our  congress  can  override  you  regarding  the  Saudis , 5%of our  oil  comes  from  them ! How  much  did  they  buy  the  floor  at TT. for !  Blood on your  hands  
4786 2018-11-21 19:22:39 Of course my daughter would go through a sleep regression when I forget to place my cbd oil order in time and run out for dayyssss so basically I’m just going insane 
4787 2018-11-21 19:22:38 We really should stop selling our oil to the US.
4788 2018-11-21 19:22:35 We have plenty of oil, and he is LYING on "sales" to them, NO sales, just "letters of intent". +we have solar, wind, hydro, biomass- we don't NEED blood for oil. #NoBloodForOil.
4789 2018-11-21 19:22:32 new tires & an oil change me pls 
4790 2018-11-21 19:22:30 Sometimes I pray that the oil wells dry up so that Nigeria will regain her senses
4791 2018-11-21 19:22:28 3 years later and he still brings up Harper's name. He has done nothing but conspire with Nutley to destroy Alberta's oil sands and our economy. Time for all industry across Canada to be shut down. Maybe then people would wake up.
4792 2018-11-21 19:22:27 By the way, we’re not having a “Dem” argument here. I was asked to provide proof of voter suppression. Gerrymandering is voter suppression, by definition. I did what was asked. Why do you think the OP who challenged me hasn’t responded even as you make this poor attempt at debate
4793 2018-11-21 19:22:25 Low gas prices means that American oil production is not profitable, and American energy companies cut jobs. How is cutting American jobs and paying Saudis putting America first?
4794 2018-11-21 19:22:19 yeah!!! power surges rolling in/out of oil city, pa!
4795 2018-11-21 19:22:15 Lower oil prices! Definitely worth Khashoggi getting dismembered while still alive!!!!!
4796 2018-11-21 19:22:14 Here's some #WednesdayWisdom: skip the marshmallows and brown sugar, and make savory sweet potatoes instead. Coat potatoes with some veggie oil, a little hot sauce, and some cajun seasoning if you have it. , then just roast in the oven. Way less sugar and way more flavor.
4797 2018-11-21 19:22:13 Not Encana too!  I used to work there when Gwyn Morgan was president.  Like most of us, he’s critical of this Liberal government and how they are decimating the oil industry. And he would know!  
No more inexperienced government!  
JUST SAY NO TO TRUDEAU!
4798 2018-11-21 19:22:11 Hard reality: He was correct when he said that he could shoot someone in broad daylight on 5th Ave & his supporters would still stand w/ him. 
Oil PPB being exceptionally low is the only way to keep it relevant anymore. Tech advances have cemented competitiveness of renewables.
4799 2018-11-21 19:22:02 Its oil. Can you trade that as a stock (chart-wise)?
4800 2018-11-21 19:21:56 Can you just be happy for lower gas and oil prices?  I am taking a cut in my little oil and gas checks, but I'm not complaining.  I spend a lot more,  gassing up my car, than I make off of my oil well.
4801 2018-11-21 19:21:56 Think this through. What do you suppose was left of the Turkey at all, in a fire started by trying to cook the foreign non Turkey Substance in the super heated Peanut Oil?
4802 2018-11-21 19:21:56 Monroe City Mo - Caseys gas station, Fire dept responding for a gas spill, employees applied oil dry and want it checked on.
4803 2018-11-21 19:21:53 Maybe Big Oil should organize a big parade and vacation in Trump hotels.
4804 2018-11-21 19:21:51 Hemp Classic and Companion Oil only this time.
4805 2018-11-21 19:21:49 Oil is a fungible commodity.  When one nation lowers their prices it has a domino effect on all others  :-)
4806 2018-11-21 19:21:47 When has it ever been any different always has been always will be.Blair and Bush didn’t invade Iraq for the good of the people,all about the oil and money imo
4807 2018-11-21 19:21:47 Pray for master Trump to regain his soul and stand for America's values not for money and wealth. The unjust killing of Jamal Khashoggi isn't worth the 11% of oil import from Saudi Arabia
4808 2018-11-21 19:21:46 OK, will be better if more people could patronise me and buy original undiluted designer oil perfumes
4809 2018-11-21 19:21:46 The logic of this president baffled me, he blamed California for mismanaging federal property and defended the Saudis because he needed their oil that caused the change in climate which is causing California to burn and Texas to flood. Am I the only ones that see it this way?
4810 2018-11-21 19:21:44 Thank you Wawa for the $2.19 a gallon gas. I believe the oil used to make it come from Canada, where they don’t kill journalists.
4811 2018-11-21 19:21:43 funny enough, corpers work in banks and oil companies, just need to have the right connect!
4812 2018-11-21 19:21:37 I would go but I bought a maintenance package with my car at Nissan and I get free oil changes here because of that so 
4813 2018-11-21 19:21:37 How much is an oil change in Canada these days?
4814 2018-11-21 19:21:32 Don’t use that stuff it’s full of palm oil!! Better products out there

4820 2018-11-21 19:21:23 Coconut oil is life
4821 2018-11-21 19:21:18 Yes it is. Do you want trade war on oil that could result in Global financial melt down? If talking heads only knew...
4822 2018-11-21 19:21:12 Only 11 percent of oil comes to America from Saudi. You know. The country responsible for world trade Centre
4823 2018-11-21 19:21:10 Apparently the Hill and at least a couple of their 2 dozen remaining readers.
4824 2018-11-21 19:21:10 Somebody help me understand something... if the US is on pace to surpass Saudi Arabia and Russia in oil production... and Trump keeps ‘pressuring’ OPEC to lower oil costs for political gain... doesn’t that *hurt* American oil producers and jobs?
4825 2018-11-21 19:21:09 So this is how business is done. An investigative journalist is murdered for his inquiry work. The Saudis get weapons and we get cheaper oil. What is the widow and the family getting? #justonemorelife
4826 2018-11-21 19:21:04 Think you're confusing your administration's indictments with oil prices.

4832 2018-11-21 19:20:44 Yes to oil no to humanity
4833 2018-11-21 19:20:43 And what are you going to do for the hundreds of thousands of people who work in the oil and gas fields, the service station owners, the processing plants, the engineers, staffers, and many, many others?  You are cheering for Saudi while cutting your own oil industries' throats.
4834 2018-11-21 19:20:41 It's been 5th day that French people in France are protesting against increasing in oil prices.

I was thinking that even a developed nation has stood against increasing the prices of commodities.

Governments all over the world are really sucking their people lives.
4835 2018-11-21 19:20:38 Saudis have no control over oil prices and we produce more than they do. You are just the biggest compulsive liar ever period. This is going to be your down fall finally. We can't take anymore corruption so you and yours have to go ASAP !!!.
4836 2018-11-21 19:20:35 Why do we Even have a relationship with the Saudis? They Funded 9/11 hijackers and they have the same ideology as ISIS. Let’s ditch them and drill for our own oil. That would create Jobs here!
4837 2018-11-21 19:20:31 Once again, the jackass in chief displays his ignorance. This isn't 1973--Saudi Arabia has far less power over oil prices than Trump imagines. But it is a vicious, repressive regime that regularly murders and tortures its citizens--what's not to like?
4838 2018-11-21 19:20:27 Maybe it was that, or just business as usual oil war.
4839 2018-11-21 19:20:20 Trump is on NATO , the U.N. , oil prices , trade balance , deficit reduction , cuts aid to countries that damage us ,  drug avail. & prices ,  yet  so many hate him , hes a new yorker !!!   he trives on conflict .
4840 2018-11-21 19:20:10 Most of their oil comes from their neighbour to the north instead of the 11% they get from Saudi Arabia

4842 2018-11-21 19:20:02 Betull, bahkan di skincare aj ada kok. Tp sayangnya buat minyak goreng, palm oil ini di indo adalah minyak paling murah, blm ada alternatif yg lebih murah, kyk 2lt minyak normal bs di dpt seharga 20rb an, sedangkan 2lt barco (refined coconut oil) itu 60-70rb :(
4843 2018-11-21 19:20:00 It’s all about the petro dollar not so much about oil production.
4844 2018-11-21 19:19:57 Great.Thank you Mr.President for getting them to lower the price in exchange for our values and principles..wonder what would've happened if Hitler would've had oil and money to shower FDR with..would he have sold out on our soldiers and allies?
4845 2018-11-21 19:19:55 Don't overlook petrochemicals in 2nd place. WEO 2017 predicts oil demand not dropping to 2040 primarily because of 60% increase in petrochemical demand - feedstock for plastics. This is also misleading: we're seeing the beginning of the end of the age of plastics.

4851 2018-11-21 19:19:43 I'm a Canadian in the middle of Canadian oil country.  The only thing I'm seeing is mass devistation to Canadian families. Worried about losing homes, keeping lights on, keeping furnaces running and putting food on the table.  The struggle is real and growing fast!

4854 2018-11-21 19:19:35 Fear mongering. 

The oil immediately overflows when the turkey is dropped, which means they put too much oil in. 

Be responsible and show what happens when done properly. 

Been frying turkeys for 12 years and never burned a structure down.
4855 2018-11-21 19:19:31 Been there two times. What does a currency linked to oil got to do with this?
4856 2018-11-21 19:19:30 I used the deep fryer at my dads house and now the whole house smells like oil & grease... ew I hate this
4857 2018-11-21 19:19:30 You can’t draw permanent districts wish a changing population. That would actually lead to even more voter disenfranchisement and tribalism. Seriously man. Just let it go. Gerrymandering is voter suppression.
4858 2018-11-21 19:19:27 But hey they lowered the price of our oil says t-rump. Whats a little torture/murder...

4860 2018-11-21 19:19:23 Low oil prices are much more valuable than the life of a journalist, right?

4862 2018-11-21 19:19:09 Trump says 'thank you to Saudi Arabia' for lower oil prices, hours after refusing to condemn kingdom for Khashogg... Come on Republicans even those as greedy & yes Stupid as u r must know Trump is unhinged. Man up & try to do the job ur people elected u to do. At least the ...
4863 2018-11-21 19:19:04 Explain why you had to do a 8 nation waiver to buy oil from Iran to keep oil prices down. Could it be your Iran policy fucked things up?
4864 2018-11-21 19:18:59 The Trump Economy: Assisting foreign despots who murder journalists while claiming that the drop in oil prices had nothing to do with the stock market dropping. 

Happy Thanksgiving! What do we get for Christmas? A full fledged crash on Wall Street? Layoff notices for New Year's?
4865 2018-11-21 19:18:56 That may be so but why would you expect Trump to know that Canada supplies more oil then Saudi Arabia?
4866 2018-11-21 19:18:55 全ての料理はオイルなしに作れない…(作れるのもあるかも、え、あるのかなぁ)
4867 2018-11-21 19:18:55 Only 8% of the oil Americans use comes from Saudi Arabia, so something else, besides American interest, is driving Trump’s immoral stance siding with the Saudis. Wake up Trumpers!!
4868 2018-11-21 19:18:53 First of all, this was from Tzeporah Berman. HAHAHA and it was a very weak article about Oil Sands as far as I can tell.
4869 2018-11-21 19:18:51 Ummmm  we are now the worlds leading oil producer
4870 2018-11-21 19:18:51 Girls are yelling in my building and they came to ask for oil so I was like "hey maybe don't yell at midnight bc I have exams" and they were like "we're only here for 1 week" bitch do u think my exams give a shit about that DON'T YELL SO LOUD

4872 2018-11-21 19:18:44 Some things are more important than lower gas prices, like condemning brutal murderers!
*Also, the US only gets about 11% of its oil from Saudi Arabia!
4873 2018-11-21 19:18:43 Fcuk off #infantino. The only thing you’re interested in ‘creating’ here is a piece of the oil money action not “miracles”
4874 2018-11-21 19:18:41 Mr. Trump, in 2018, America became the world's largest producer of crude oil, surpassing both Russian and Saudi Arabia. So what you're calling for will devastate American oil producers--cripple them. 

Help America, not Saudi Arabia.
4875 2018-11-21 19:18:40 Where does Trump buy gas?  I am now paying $3.69 a gallon! I realize it takes a while for the cost of oil to spill over to gasoline prices, but costs in my area have steadily increased..no relief in sight!
4876 2018-11-21 19:18:36 #impactoncruisebiz: Oil prices rise 4% Wednesday, recovering from the lowest level in months. West Texas Intermediate at $55 a barrel, still way lower than a month ago.
4877 2018-11-21 19:18:36 Lies... US gets far more oil from Canada than from Saudis
4878 2018-11-21 19:18:36 Trump says when his moral compass points North then oil prices go North. But no worries, his moral compass points South and oil prices go South. #Immoral
4879 2018-11-21 19:18:35 I have specially lined pants pockets specifically to hold oil in case someone needs to make naan.
4880 2018-11-21 19:18:33 The plan for Iran was to build a pipeline from the Iranian oil fields to Iran in the Trans-Iran-Israel pipeline. You don't know much, I can tell.
4881 2018-11-21 19:18:33 @realDonaldTrump all of this is to push the White House to keep Iran's oil completely intact, the goal of Iran's oil. Until Iranian oil is completely cut off, the Iranian regime will not go anywhere.
4882 2018-11-21 19:18:25 Yes, but punishing Saudi Arabia right now would likely result in complete collapse of the world economy when OPEC raises oil prices to $150 a barrel! Plus China and Russia would LOVE to sell them the $Billions in military equipment. Talk about shooting yourself in the foot! SMH
4883 2018-11-21 19:18:24 While it's nice sentiment, let's be real for a moment. The judiciary  isn't independent (see Bush v Gore). So let's put away the anointing oil and let CJ Roberts go back to screwing over little people in favor  of big biz & Republican donors.

4887 2018-11-21 19:18:09 Mr President,
Are you aware that if oil prices go any lower, US Permian producers will go bankrupt.
Lot of jobs will be lost
4888 2018-11-21 19:18:08 Forests are being cut down and orangutans are losing their habitats  to enable more palm plantations. Guess what? Palm oil is found in cuppa soups and chocolates. Just telling you so you can make more informed decisions when you are shopping.
4889 2018-11-21 19:18:05 Voter disenfranchisement. That’s a synonym for voter suppression, by the way. So do you want to keep proving my point over and over for me, or do you want to maybe admit you got in over your head on this one? No shame in admitting a mistake.
4890 2018-11-21 19:18:02 Cussons baby oil, that's what my body's familiar with

4892 2018-11-21 19:17:58 I'm with you on this one. Lower crude oil prices means lower gasoline prices at the pump.
4893 2018-11-21 19:17:57 Also isn’t more then half of “foreign oil” from places like Canada and Mexico? Dont know if need to worry about those two.

4897 2018-11-21 19:17:48 156.9p at Southwaite in Cumbria thanks to @BP_plc 

Last weekend travelling to London I needed 1ltr of oil. £24 for an unbranded litre in a BP service station, but further along it was only £10.50 for Castrol at an @Esso_GB Station.

I now avoid BP all the time. Greedy b’stards.
4898 2018-11-21 19:17:39 40% of US oil is sourced from Canada & only 10% from Saudi Arabia.
Please.
4899 2018-11-21 19:17:34 Oil prices are still dropping, we need to push renewable energy now.
4900 2018-11-21 19:17:32 While it's nice sentiment, let's be real for a moment. The judiciary isn't independent (see Bush v Gore). So let's put away the annointing oil and let CJ Roberts go back to screwing over little people in favor of big biz & Republican donors.

4903 2018-11-21 19:17:27 Question !!! since oil is purchased globally via the petro dollar/ opec cartel ,  Are there no obvious benefits to high oil price for USA since oil is denominated in petro dollars
4904 2018-11-21 19:17:26 LIAR! Oil was at $56!!!
4905 2018-11-21 19:17:15 And you probably get your news from trumps twitter!  He doesn’t even know where the USA gets most of its oil
4906 2018-11-21 19:17:14 Haha similarly Canada blames disasters in US oil producing states for higher domestic gas prices but Canada refines all of its own oil lol
4907 2018-11-21 19:17:11 bukan cuma di minyak gorang
palm oil juga digunakan, di produk makanan snacks biasanya. bahkan produk buat mandi kayak sabun sama sampo, bahkan di tissue pun palm oil bisa ditemukan,
campaign tentang gunakan sedikit produk yg make palm oil udah muncul dari beberapa tahun

4909 2018-11-21 19:17:11 Gimme a break. You practically thanked Osama for making your building the tallest in New York. Were he alive today, you’d be excusing his atrocities for the sake of weapons deals and oil prices. You’d be exchanging letters, declaring your love, and sword dancing into the night.
4910 2018-11-21 19:17:10 Take the oil!
4911 2018-11-21 19:17:10 I suppose you will be sending Jim Acosta to Saudi Arabia to do a story on low oil prices and your hero's tax cut. New rule: send all journalist who oppose me to S.A.  Sincerely President Jigsaw.
4912 2018-11-21 19:17:05 America's oil in Iraq means Korea if it wants to weaken the US military, it is to consolidate relations with Iraq can build a base in Iraq and future Korea can deprive the United States of 80% of its oil and the back of America .. Victory Korea starts from Iraq!
4913 2018-11-21 19:17:03 Oil prices lower just like the stock market. Thanks!
4914 2018-11-21 19:16:56 Fake carbon tax and global warming fear factory is funded by oil & gas industry. Why ? Oil prices increase  It doesn’t take much research to work that con out.
4915 2018-11-21 19:16:53 So enjoy your few cents saving in gas, America, it only cost one murder. 
Besides, we don't need foreign oil. We're packed to the gills of our own resources.

4917 2018-11-21 19:16:51 I kind of want oil around 100. Thanks.

4922 2018-11-21 19:16:37 It would be much better if we stop buying foreign oil and start using our own. Cost of fuel would be cut more than half. Could see $1.25 or less if we use our own. Cot the tax on fuel would do the same also and if we use our own resources and cut those fuel tax we could see $0.80
4923 2018-11-21 19:16:35 3 hrs for a fucking oil change !? Bruh w t f
4924 2018-11-21 19:16:35 It's because of the Petro dollar , the worlds reserve currency is the US dollar, oil is only traded in US dollars. Mainly because of Saudi Arabia. If Saudi Arabia declines to sell oil in US dollars, the dollar and every bank account will rake an impeccable hit. Major depression.

4927 2018-11-21 19:16:28 Thanks Rick, we Canadians have a subtle way of making our point. He also forgot to mention that a good portion of Canadian oil is bought way below market value because our US funded environmentalists have managed to stop any new pipelines to get our product to a shipping port
4928 2018-11-21 19:16:23 hey y’all just did a lil bit of digging and found a really great vegan alternative for fish oil with ur desired omeg-3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA: algal oil!

4930 2018-11-21 19:16:15 Reality is proportional representation is at the heart of this. People move, demos change. There may be a case made to draw permanent districts based on diff criteria, requiring const amend thus limiting number of reps. But heart of dem argument here is false
4931 2018-11-21 19:16:06 He could have said they cut the legs out from under the oil price that might have been worse.
4932 2018-11-21 19:16:06 US produces the most oil. So it’s not driven by SA. Saying this is not going to save you from protecting MBS. Murder is not ok. How are you feeling?   You don’t look well.
4933 2018-11-21 19:16:05 Is that why oil stocks dropped $ 3.77 today.
4934 2018-11-21 19:15:56 I mixed tea tree oil with my charcoal face mask and now my face feels cold asf.
4935 2018-11-21 19:15:52 Lol I hate trump as much as the next but this has to do with OPEC and Saudi oil being traded on the US dollar. Why do you think we didnt go into Saudi Arabia when the hijackers of 9/11 came from there? Same old song and dance, wake up people!
4936 2018-11-21 19:15:50 Enjoy it at the cost of an American resident's life.  I, don't think so Donnie.  In fact, the US could have pushed the price of oil lower just by releasing reserves.  I wonder who in your inner circle might have been an accessory.  
4937 2018-11-21 19:15:42 It isn't oil, it's arms deals.
4938 2018-11-21 19:15:41 It was pretty horrendous looking inside... what is worse is my husband’s insistence that air filtration is snake oil. Can you recommend a good air quality monitor that is independent of these devices?
4939 2018-11-21 19:15:36 Stunner!
4940 2018-11-21 19:15:32 always better to think you have too little oil than have too much in the pot
4941 2018-11-21 19:15:30 It doesn’t matter: a human being was kidnapped, tortured, murdered, and his corpse was desecrated. Nationality isn’t specified in our laws. Trump traded a person for oil prices.

4944 2018-11-21 19:15:28 So does that mean you will support all those who work in the oil industry? Sweet, sign me up
4945 2018-11-21 19:15:27 45 owes the Saudi royals for saving him from bankruptcy. He treats the country from which the US gets 40% of its oil like garbage. Probably because 2 Trump brand hotels dropped the name since he became president. No wonder Trump can't stand Canada.
4946 2018-11-21 19:15:27 Redrawn so that there are more republicans than democrats or vice versa. That IS voter suppression. If a vote doesn’t matter then it’s suppressed. It’s weird that you don’t understand how synonyms work. Gerrymandering IS voter suppression.
4947 2018-11-21 19:15:22 The US only imports 9% of it's petroleum from Saudi Arabia as Trump falls to his knees to appease them. Meanwhile, the US imports 40% of it's petroleum from Canada, a TRUE ally, & Trump trashes them endlessly. There's A LOT more going on with Trump and the Saudi's other than oil!
4948 2018-11-21 19:15:22 @AldiUK in the future will your own brand items stop containing palm oil, palm fat or palm sugar. I was disappointed to find it in all your mince pies.
4949 2018-11-21 19:15:18 Oil was up on speculation, not supply and demand, that’s why it dropped so fast, speculators selling it out. News outlets said supply and demand... dead wrong. There is talk of reviving the Saudi-Aramco IPO, which they pulled when the price went up.
4950 2018-11-21 19:15:16 RT @LivingSafely: Brominated vegetable oil ("BVO") in your sodas this November? This flame retardant can be used to prevent separation.

4954 2018-11-21 19:15:13 Heating prices haven’t lowered (but we do have heat in a home unlike those in tents in FL, CA and PR). Gas is stupid high. Who’s benefiting off low oil barrels other than the country who murdered a US citizen?
4955 2018-11-21 19:15:08 I had a job working in the oil patch my very first job out there the man they had me working with, Lifted Me Up by my coveralls and told me I could suck his dick!! Unfortunately nothing is ever going to change...
4956 2018-11-21 19:15:06 Here’s the thing, the US doesn’t get even a fraction of its oil from Saudi Arabia. The biggest producer of American oil is ....the United States.
4957 2018-11-21 19:15:02 Nobody in the exploration and production sector is celebrating these lower prices.  It costs a lot of money to produce oil from shale.
4958 2018-11-21 19:15:00 So #Trump actually admits it's all about money and oil.
4959 2018-11-21 19:14:57 Dismayed to realise that all of my favourite chocolate bars contain palm oil but I put them back on the shelf today and will continue to do so while @CadburyUK are using it.
4960 2018-11-21 19:14:53 Hey Alex, Saudi supplies about 11% of our oil.   Check it out, who’s the “IDIOT” now????
4961 2018-11-21 19:14:53 We here in Louisiana do not like this statement mr. president and you carried Louisiana . A lot of us are in real trouble because of this oil lowering. Don’t forget you will loose many followers here. We love you but not this statement or this idea. Please we needs jobs here.
4962 2018-11-21 19:14:53 How would you deal with the situation? You must know it’s very complicated with serious ramifications. Would you cut ties, resulting in insanely high oil costs? Would you declare war? Where are your solutions? Quit with the name calling , grow up and offer solutions
4963 2018-11-21 19:14:46 Put a few drops of Menthol eucalyptus oil in a bowl of steaming hot water. It will help your airways open. I’m asthmatic and swear by this remedy. Feel better soon.
4964 2018-11-21 19:14:46 Don't forget palm oil kills orangutans. Don't eat palm oil. You have to check everything for it. it's in every chocolate bar #PalmOilAlarmCall
4965 2018-11-21 19:14:44 America gets the bulk of its oil from Canada, not Saudi......................
4966 2018-11-21 19:14:40 Brutus is telling the truth, The Khoza's should cleanse their home, hell even bring ZCC and Bushiri to cleanse the house and bath Kagiso in Annointing oil and hopefully chase the demon of stupidity from him #TheQueenMzansi
4967 2018-11-21 19:14:40 Apparently the price for cheap oil is the murder of a journalist.
4968 2018-11-21 19:14:38 You haven’t thought this through. If we pulled out of our relationship there, what do you think would happen? Yup, Russia and prob China would get in there and destabilise the whole region. Oil would rocket and war would be inevitable. It’s a balance of power thing.
4969 2018-11-21 19:14:30 Imagine how much cheaper our oil would be if they killed 100 journalists.
4970 2018-11-21 19:14:29 It isn't oil prices really. He thought his tweet would appease the public with lower gas price talk. He is very out of touch with the common man or woman. He is all about the arms sales to SA. He is owned by big money.
4971 2018-11-21 19:14:28 I know oil rigs are sometimes very remote but damn, that looks like a pretty scary airstrip.
4972 2018-11-21 19:14:25 A bone from the masters of the bone saw... We don't even use that much of the Saudi oil...
4973 2018-11-21 19:14:22 MR. DUMBFUCKPRESIDENT @realDonaldTrump lower oil prices is bad. Saudi Arabia killing an American is bad. Wake the fuck up.
4974 2018-11-21 19:14:16 A by-product of forcibly dropping oil prices to crush Russia's and lran's economies.  trump did not start this 'trend'.

4976 2018-11-21 19:14:14 Oil is too important. Let’s be real about it. 
4977 2018-11-21 19:14:12 Successfully putting pressure on the Saudis to lower oil prices is though - or maybe you weren't aware of that?
4978 2018-11-21 19:14:08 @MikeLakeMP  May I ask why I rarely see you speaking up in the House on behalf of the oil workers in your constituency? Especially in Nisku, Beaumont and  Leduc..like myself.
4979 2018-11-21 19:14:07 which one do you recommend? i love gun oil.
4980 2018-11-21 19:14:03 Prof Leach’s partisan biases are best studied by looking at his views on provincial investment in oil refining and/or possible government-mandated output cuts.
4981 2018-11-21 19:13:58 But how else you're going to get cheaper oil and buyers for your treasury bonds/debt?
4982 2018-11-21 19:13:57 Don't forget palm oil kills orangutans to. Don't eat palm oil. You have to check everything for it it's in every chocolate bar #PalmOilAlarmCall
4983 2018-11-21 19:13:54 He's jealous of their oil supply, as is putin. He's also jealous of #Trudeau who is more intelligent & has better hair. If Russia invaded Alaska & Canada to take their oil tomorrow, the orange abomination wouldn't send any ships to repell the invasion. #putinsPUPPET #TrumpRussia
4984 2018-11-21 19:13:51 Thanks @JoyBehar for your shout out to Canada this am re. Oil..
4985 2018-11-21 19:13:47 You’re not going to believe this, but not all cultures are equal. The Middle East is a den of dictatorships ruled by barbaric force and oil. If we were them and they us, they would attack and plunder our wealth. Except Israel.
4986 2018-11-21 19:13:42 Ok Don! I have spent the last 4 years waiting for oil to get to 60 dollars so we could start wells back up. The price has been down wells are shut down still. This is how I pay taxes and feed my family!! The lifting cost is a big factor on money made on small wells. No on lower!
4987 2018-11-21 19:13:35 Why isn't someone (the press?) telling Americans that we could survive solely on America's production of oil !!!! We are not beholden to SA for oil.
4988 2018-11-21 19:13:34 Soooo, why are you showing a picture of a “oil spill” clean-up?
4989 2018-11-21 19:13:33 HanJinLiGiDi
4990 2018-11-21 19:13:33 The US doesn’t need Saudi’s oil or its blood money. But I’ll bet you do.
4991 2018-11-21 19:13:32 So basically Saudi Arabia can do whatever they want and the US will not respond because OIL
4992 2018-11-21 19:13:29 What you just said isn’t gerrymandering. Gerrymandering is when they redraw the district to exclude enough potential voters for the opposition, so it doesn’t matter if any or all of them vote because it’s mathematically impossible to win an election when you’ve had the district..

4994 2018-11-21 19:13:18 You always want to go lower....um, oh, you were talking about oil prices.  I just assumed you were talking about your conduct in general.
4995 2018-11-21 19:13:17 Saudi Arabia doesn’t set oil prices. They are but a piece of that pricing puzzle so for Drumpf to suggest it again highlights his ignorance.

4998 2018-11-21 19:13:16 We get 40% of oil here in the US and that would be incentive to use more solar energy. But oil, oil, oil.

5000 2018-11-21 19:13:09 The CIA put Pahlavi in power because the Iranians decided to nationalized their own oil fields and kicked BP out of the oil fields. It's Western imperialism. Because of the Islamic Revolution, the CIA put Saddam in charge of the Sunni Ba'athist party and

Don't you mean prairie people who work for the oil industry?  Because that's who you've talked to in this article.

Shameful promotion of one perspective by Canada's public broadcaster. Do your job.  #cdnpoli #skpoli
5006 2018-11-21 19:12:55 Oh my gosh
Yes!!! I was accused of bullying a ‘vulnerable young mother’. Why? Because she posted some anti-vaxx crap and I told her she was irresponsible. 
Someone I know posted yesterday about essential oils killing bad germs. And don’t get me started on coconut oil!
5007 2018-11-21 19:12:42 @ChrisCuomo please challenge anyone who claims the US needs Saudi Arabia for oil or business. 40% oil from Canada only 9% from SA. Overall exports to China then Canada, SA not in top 5. If he's worried about money be nicer to Canada.
5008 2018-11-21 19:12:38 40% of our oil is from Canada, idiot. Only 11% is from SA. Why do you thank Saudis I wonder ...
5009 2018-11-21 19:12:37 Actually, low oil prices are a tribute to American hydrocarbon production, but @realDonaldTrump has always liked foreign princes more than he likes Americans.
5010 2018-11-21 19:12:34 Steam or olpas oil
5011 2018-11-21 19:12:32 When the media discovers why Trump can't kick the Saudis to the curb they will be shocked. It's not about oil. The Saudis are paying for Trump's private CIA, the Iran agenda, and potentially, our forever wars. They Saud's just need a little US mentoring, for good money, of course
5012 2018-11-21 19:12:25 Reminder: don't fry a Turkey in your garage, or on your deck.

5017 2018-11-21 19:12:11 Get the oil running.... so you can subsidize all your pet projects..
5018 2018-11-21 19:12:08 America buys 40% of its oil from Canada & only buys 9% from Saudi Arabia. Trump derides Canada yet praises the Saudis - even after the CIA confirms that MBS ordered the murder of Khashoggi. Why? Because Trump is compromised & corrupt. It’s blindingly obvious.
5019 2018-11-21 19:12:05 I was just goiong to reply with exactly what David said.
5020 2018-11-21 19:12:00 Trump is a liar, even I knew we get more oil from Canada than Saudi.
Been that way for a long time.
I love Canada.

5023 2018-11-21 19:11:48 Green energy equals freedom from oil prices.
5024 2018-11-21 19:11:47 Y'all don't like Saudi's low oil prices? Quit buying their oil. Sell your call. Invest in a bike.
5025 2018-11-21 19:11:45 We don't use foreign oil anymore. In fact, the USA is the No. 1 oil exporter. You must've missed all the earthquakes we have now cuz we're fracking the shit outta this country & laying down a massive spiraling web of leaking pipelines across our waterways.
5026 2018-11-21 19:11:43 We only get 11% of our oil from SA. Most comes from Canada & South America. But, let a foreign power kill an American resident. This puts all Americans at risk overseas.
5027 2018-11-21 19:11:40 Our currency is weak and unstable that's why we cannot benefit from the cheap oil
5028 2018-11-21 19:11:38 So global oil prices are plunging, and yet the gas prices in #ymm went UP from 104.9 to 117.9/L.  Yeah......pure greed is taking over. What a bunch of crap. #greedyfuckers #annoying
5029 2018-11-21 19:11:35 Gas prices drop just before major holidays and elections then shoot back up.   I’d wait until Monday to praise the Crown Prince for getting away with murder by increasing oil production.
5030 2018-11-21 19:11:35 Where's Canada's thank you? We supply you with more oil then they do.
5031 2018-11-21 19:11:30 Yet most of the oil from Canada does not stay in AMERICA because it is considered " dirty" oil.
5032 2018-11-21 19:11:27 Many older oil tanker simply float around like this pumping oil to other ships pr simply wait for another conflict elsewhere that drives up their sell prices.
5033 2018-11-21 19:11:23 Bullshit Donald, US doesnt buy much oil from Saudis. US domestic shale oil priduction has meant low prices.

5044 2018-11-21 19:10:50 The president of the United States justified the murder of an American resident and journalist by a foreign government by praising the price of oil.

5049 2018-11-21 19:10:44 B.S. it's about Trump First and how much money can he get.  And why are some #Americans paying $4 a gallon if oil is so cheap?
5050 2018-11-21 19:10:43 Saudis is saying where is our money from oil revenue.  Is trump’s thank you worth losing $25 a barrel oil money?  How are we going to pay for our citizens’ benefit next year?  Low oil price is not going to last long.  Saudis already start that they are cutting oil output
5051 2018-11-21 19:10:38 Donnie,
That’s not how oil prices work. US oil companies will cut oil exploration and jobs when Oil gets to cheap.
5052 2018-11-21 19:10:34 The oil!
5053 2018-11-21 19:10:30 We're not living in a textbook global economic environment. Never did, never will.

The US cannot control other nations' oil production or force them to buy goods, ie. weapons from us.

Obviously you two don't know anything so it's best to just shut up and let the MAN do his job.

5063 2018-11-21 19:10:14 Off-topic question if I may. Is the oil we're getting from Canada extracted there in Canada or are they importing it for themselves and then selling us a cut of that? I'm curious now...

5072 2018-11-21 19:09:58 Jason, it's a window into a clueless man.

He's PROUD of the blood-deal he's made, trumpeting out (pardon) how the price of oil has diminished because of him.

His amoral, thuggish and churlish imbecility could not be more proudly displayed.
5073 2018-11-21 19:09:56 STABLE GENIUS SELLS SOUL TO GET LOWER OIL PRICES FROM SAUDI ARABIA. All for naught, said MarketWatch, because lower oil prices hurt U.S. oil shale producers & ergo the economy. The evil genius at work, AGAIN, w/o weighing consequences.

5078 2018-11-21 19:09:50 Oil changes and shit 
5079 2018-11-21 19:09:49 They hold Trump hostage through oil prices as well. If they want to jerk his chain, they can reduce production and raise prices and Trump's popularity will decline.
5080 2018-11-21 19:09:48 It's happening now, capitalism and tech will do their thing. Honestly, if solar tech was just taking out Korean and Chinese manufacturers instead of big coal and oil, everyone would be talking about the stunning price declines and success. Instead it is under-reported.
5081 2018-11-21 19:09:48 Cooking oil and different food dyes mixed in. The oil is non-toxic, and will keep the colors from mixing too much.

5083 2018-11-21 19:09:45 Trump's response reveals that he has no moral compass at all. He prefers low oil prices to the lives of 85K Yemeni children and working journalists. Unconscionable.
5084 2018-11-21 19:09:42 Another lie. Saudi Arabia is not the cause of lower oil prices. But while you’re at it, it is the cause of the butchering of a US resident. Tax cut? I supersized my  instead.
5085 2018-11-21 19:09:41 So lowering oil prices was the bribe that got you to bury your head in the sand when Saudi Arabia killed a legal American resident?

5090 2018-11-21 19:09:37 Is it for the oil brand itself or a service station?
5091 2018-11-21 19:09:36 I knew that is why the oil prices have come down.
SA is trying to make is easier for tr*&^ to defend & protect them.
They think the American ppl are stupid & will turn a blind eye to the savagery if we get something out of it.
#Khashoggi #SayHisName
5092 2018-11-21 19:09:32 So Trump admits that Saudi Arabia controls the world’s economy and the United States’ economy is exclusively subservient to those who own the oil. I thought the tax cuts would solve all our problems and only Trump could make America great again. Now he tells us we are MBS bitch.
5093 2018-11-21 19:09:32 oil and gas aren't very related
5094 2018-11-21 19:09:31 Well they wont try to sell oil for euro's ever again unless they want to be destroyed like when Saddam Hussein did. The petrol dollar doesn't forgive.
5095 2018-11-21 19:09:30 Let's be clear Canada-  supplies the US 4 x the amount of oil that Saudi Arabia does
5096 2018-11-21 19:09:15 Hey dummy we get most of the oil from Canada
5097 2018-11-21 19:09:14 I can change a tire, do an oil change, change brake pads and rotors, spark plugs, and other basic maintenance on my vehicle...
5098 2018-11-21 19:09:09 Oil and commodities and except job market, every data say US will have recession 2019
5099 2018-11-21 19:09:09 As you can see, besides few retweets and likes, this is not getting a lot of attention. No Saudi oil or big arms deals. May be if you try a bit more journalistic integrity and try to highlight the war crimes against the Muslims there, you could attract some sympathy. Try it!!
5100 2018-11-21 19:08:57 Did Fox News thank Canada that supplies 40% of US foreign oil imports at a cheaper price than Saudi oil vs Saudi Arabia's 11% of US foreign oil imports? Didn't think so...#buyCanadianoil
5101 2018-11-21 19:08:54 She says oohl not oil
5102 2018-11-21 19:08:49 Why am I still seeing high prices at the pump, Premium has gone up from 2.89 a gall to 3.14 ??? Can remember way back,  25 cents a gallon (60's) Oil companies were still Billionaires
5103 2018-11-21 19:08:48 Let's face it, unless someone from Fox News is killed by Saudi Arabia, Trump couldn't care less.
5104 2018-11-21 19:08:41 Too bad no one has educated them to the fact that:

OPEC is the major influencer of global oil prices...

And Barkindo of Nigeria is the current head of OPEC...

#FatNixon is selling himself out to the wrong country if low oil prices is his goal.
5105 2018-11-21 19:08:39 The best way to treat kale it to cook it in coconut oil for three minutes. Then it slides nicely from the pan into the garbage.
5106 2018-11-21 19:08:34 And remember we get more of our oil from Canada! So, does it really help our pocketbooks. Probably not.
5107 2018-11-21 19:08:30 The USA has also illegally used spent uranium shells and cluster munitions in its illegal bombing and occupation of Syria. And stealing it's oil. So before spreading your hate filled lies I suggest you learn some basic FACTS. The USA is a war mongering parasite. And should leave.
5108 2018-11-21 19:08:27 u for take the oil oooo
5109 2018-11-21 19:08:24 Ahahaha! Business is booming now oil is discovered in 1998..Hon, your dad is better than you
5110 2018-11-21 19:08:24 The US imports only 11% of oil from Saudi Arabia, while 40% imported from Canada. 
Thank Canada not the "murderous" Kingdom.

5112 2018-11-21 19:08:13 They are lower because we ( the United States) are over producing and flooding the market. We are producing more oil than Russia or Saudi Arabia.

5114 2018-11-21 19:08:06 we don't need Saudi oil - since their can't control their murderous rage perhaps we stop letting them decide the price of oil in the world? Time for some new economics, honest and non-murdering economics END THE FED @POTUS

5116 2018-11-21 19:08:05 I thought we no longer depend on Saudi's for oil;  that USA is the largest oil producer, are we not?
5117 2018-11-21 19:08:05 What were we supposed to go to war with them? Sancations and damage the economy on oil prices? There was no win for us
5118 2018-11-21 19:08:00 Also 2016 American policy change under trump accelerated this. Read about the “energy dominance” strategy of trump. Rt bow pipline capacity is at 100% that’s why WTI is selling 10 dollar low. Once USA builds the required pipelines. I can bet oil will never rise above 50 from 2020
5119 2018-11-21 19:07:54 Trump is calling cheaper oil a tax break because he couldn’t give us a real one
5120 2018-11-21 19:07:52 Year 8 misconception that I wasn't expecting. Uses for crude oil include cooking  
Then minds blown when I explained sunflower oil is basically squeezed from the seeds

5121 2018-11-21 19:07:44 $VLO gaining traction. My favorite refiner/oil trade right now. Amazing it has dropped from $130 to below $80 this year. It is a cash cow even with crack spread tightening a little.
5122 2018-11-21 19:07:43 I think you can get the oil so hot that any water on the surface of the turkey flashes to steam
5123 2018-11-21 19:07:41 Now we know...Oil is thicker than blood! #Kashoggi
5124 2018-11-21 19:07:38 Girl, say less. Castor oil has medicinal use in our household (and culture), so start with little amounts and go from there.
5125 2018-11-21 19:07:34 Mann I just pulled up to the Jiffy Lube and the technician start looking at me Crazy .. So I’m like “Why you looking at me like that?” He like ohh it’s not you I’m having a bad day .. Well bitch Fix yo face !!! I need my damn oil changed periodT!
5126 2018-11-21 19:07:31 He doesn’t realize his country produced more light  oil than Saudi now? WTI under 50$ has long term consequences? Nobody stepping up in the White House telling him what that means? It's not all about Inflation and low rates?
5127 2018-11-21 19:07:29 Get a trim. Then get braids and use castor oil
5128 2018-11-21 19:07:27 And there we have it! Trump doesn't sanction Saudi Arabia and they lower oil prices! What else is he getting in exchange?
5129 2018-11-21 19:07:24 Oil rally fade away - 1.3% retracement from 4% rally
5130 2018-11-21 19:07:24 I would thank the Canadian oil industrt too

5132 2018-11-21 19:07:19 Wow, my AirPods would die as I’m getting an oil change high asf lol wow.
5133 2018-11-21 19:07:18 We’ve got plenty of oil and gas. So much that we’re building LNG terminals and exporting our own oil, gas and gasoline.
5134 2018-11-21 19:07:16 Once again...you’re hoping that your base is too stupid to understand that the Saudis DO NOT set the price of oil.
5135 2018-11-21 19:07:15 They are higher than when he was "elected"

What is he celebrating ?

2 yrs of higher oil prices ?
5136 2018-11-21 19:07:11 The price of oil dropped, the price of our silence, or will we show some real moral courage and expel Saudi diplomats?
5137 2018-11-21 19:07:09 I am a robot. I piss oil
5138 2018-11-21 19:07:07 Oil of favour fall upon you!
5139 2018-11-21 19:07:03 Wondering why @Morrisons are adding palm oil which we all know is bad for the planet! to their sweet potato chips from the produce department. Surly this needs to stop! Morrison’s have got rid of plastic bags. Now come on have a look at palm oil #savetherainforest
5140 2018-11-21 19:07:01 Or when are they going to give up all the modern amenities and comfort created by oil to improve lives? give up every modern convenience and go back living to the stone age!!!
5141 2018-11-21 19:07:00 Oil speaks louder than HUMAN RIGHTS!
5142 2018-11-21 19:06:58 But we get more oil from Canada...
5143 2018-11-21 19:06:56 Man, it’s weird what a new place/lifestyle can do to you.
 
In Hawaii, I was
• Hella tan
• severely underweight
• oil af
• depressed all the time 

In California, I am
• Paler
• turned into a lil chonker (yay, tiddies!)
• skin dryer than store bought cake mix
5144 2018-11-21 19:06:50 But no b oil n gas na
5145 2018-11-21 19:06:48 Ha ha. Why do you think WM wants to hang on to us so much if we're costing money. Truth is we contribute a huge amount . Last week Telegraph was extolling the fact that Scottish oil will bale you out again,just like in Thatchers day.
5146 2018-11-21 19:06:46 @RealDonalTrump you  are a horses ass. Human rights and dignity are worth far more than a few dollars on a barrel  of oil. You would probably sell your own children if the price was right. You have done nothing but bring shame and disgrace to America.
5147 2018-11-21 19:06:45 maybe one of those trains full of oil could go off the rails in @JustinTrudeau back yard to get his attention to do something!
5148 2018-11-21 19:06:45 Of course. It’s castor oil.
5149 2018-11-21 19:06:44 America is currently the biggest producer of oil!!!!
5150 2018-11-21 19:06:43 Mr. #DonTheCon do you realize that oil price is dictated by OPEC in combination with supply and demand - please stop making a fool of yourself and your ignorance of basic economic workings - how did you succeed as a businessman?
5151 2018-11-21 19:06:41 This man just said "Nae, come ride this dick to the store just watch were you going and make sure you get the oil." 
5152 2018-11-21 19:06:40 Watching UCP CANDIDATES fawn over Trump while he's crippling Alberta with steel tarrifs and driving down the price of oil is... Well infuriating.
5153 2018-11-21 19:06:40 Correct if I am wrong but when Saudi's lower oil prices, it ruins oils drilling businesses in the US?
5154 2018-11-21 19:06:36 Depends.... How much crude oil do you have and are you willing to trade it exclusively in US dollars? Every million barrels buys you a free pass on a dismemberment.
5155 2018-11-21 19:06:35 Dear Canada: We know. We're sorry. 3 Things - (1) It's always about him (2) He #lies alot-alot. (3) His nominal intelligence is ruled by #1. (he has no clue where oil or milk or cereal comes from) Yep, that's #POTUS45
5156 2018-11-21 19:06:31 This is my new favorite vegetable—delicata squash. It’s got the sweetness of an acorn squash, but you can eat the skin like a zucchini. I toss with olive oil and spices and roast. Very tasty!  Have you made this?  What veggies are you making for Thanksgiving?
5157 2018-11-21 19:06:31 In other words, murder whoever you want just keep pumping oil!
5158 2018-11-21 19:06:29 Zomg don't get me started. Baby got a card for thanksgiving. A fucking papyrus card! $12 for premium cardstock and some feathers. Worse industry than oil or cigarettes.

5160 2018-11-21 19:06:26 Considering we get a larger % of our oil from CANADA by far, the #IllegitimatePresident's stance is clearly fallacious (possibly felonious) as he is so vile to @JustinTrudeau!! Could it be all the $$$ #TrumpCrimeFamily gets from the Saudis? @POTUS
5161 2018-11-21 19:06:20 Cant drill holes and take all the Arab worlds oil and you think its fine. Nope. Just wait and see who rules the world in 10 years: Sharia Law

5164 2018-11-21 19:06:03 Oil prices dropped a lot
5165 2018-11-21 19:05:58 The Iranians murdered journalists, Jews, gays, political opponents, the wrong damn people.
Obama gave them billions I'm sure that doesn't bother you a bit.
he was an outspoken critic in enemy of the Saudi royal family.
It is far more than oil
5166 2018-11-21 19:05:47 People who self record themselves literally just headbanging to new tunes are the same people who show off their new oil they just bought by recording them taking the biggest dab they can take ever #cringeworthy
5167 2018-11-21 19:05:46 Ok so I made a quick tempura batter with like 1 cup flour tsp baking powder tsp salt tsp sugar then like 1.5 cups of water and a bit of oil then just deep fried some seitan in the batter and it was Amazing

5169 2018-11-21 19:05:42 All my guy friends are so concerned that I'm 1,500 miles over due for an oil change, but not one of them has offered to change my oil for me smh men ain't shit
5170 2018-11-21 19:05:41 I need to get my oil changed, my tires rotated, go to the nailshop, & the mall before Saturday morning & im only off tomorrow  WHEN EVERYTHING IS CLOSED 
5171 2018-11-21 19:05:35 Is this some sort of sacrifice???
5172 2018-11-21 19:05:35 Wow thanks Saudi Arabia! Brutally murdering and dismembering an American journalist sure helped those oil prices!
5173 2018-11-21 19:05:27 But you have no legal standing to do otherwise, and no moral either...  How many other countries do we have ties with that have done/are doing bad things? You don't like SA, we get that.. justifiably so.. but we DO need the oil.  Stopping that will cause hardship across the board
5174 2018-11-21 19:05:26 @realDonaldTrump praises Saudis for "low" oil price but forgets *why* they tried for years to keep it *this* low... remember the "booming" cities in midwest and Walmart paying 15$/hour there?
5175 2018-11-21 19:05:26 Changed my oil and got lunch , I need to start waking up early more often
5176 2018-11-21 19:05:26 Donald Trump has just tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to 'a big Tax Cut for America and the World!' In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
5177 2018-11-21 19:05:26 Hit that fat yeet instead
5178 2018-11-21 19:05:24 Ezege nna crude oil 
5179 2018-11-21 19:05:16 And we get the majority of our oil from Canada, so SA isn't really even all that vital to our consumption of oil....
5180 2018-11-21 19:05:14 RT @LivingSafely: Brominated vegetable oil ("BVO") in your sodas this November? This flame retardant can be used to prevent separation.

5182 2018-11-21 19:05:06 If it makes you feel any better I once watched the entirety of the Green Mile while waiting for an oil change.
5183 2018-11-21 19:05:04 .@mfa_russia on new #US #sanctions over #Iran,oil shipment to #Syria:it's 11th expansion of sanctions against #Russia in 3.5 months which makes it "routine", new sanctions rooted in America’s domestic political discord,where each party seeks to score points by any means.
5184 2018-11-21 19:05:04 It's a generation thing. My parents think any profession besides the oil and gas industry is wasted time.

They still believe YouTube is just cat videos and refuse to believe it's a major method of media distribution, because it goes against what they believe the internet to be.
5185 2018-11-21 19:05:02 Burning oil might not be such a good idea, donny! The cost of rakes will likely go up!!

5187 2018-11-21 19:04:57 And think of all those oil workers that will lose their job thanks to you Donny! Maybe your slogan should be make Saudi Arabia Great Again. SAGA Has a nice ring to it
5188 2018-11-21 19:04:56 The oil affect would be if high prices had to play off with mortgages / what helps is gasoline is now lower to the consumer year on year
5189 2018-11-21 19:04:56 Oil prices aren't dropping nearly as fast as the stock market, stable genius.  All your plans are failing and falling apart.  Thanking Saudi Arabia.  TRAITOR!
5190 2018-11-21 19:04:53 @realDonaldTrump Why not be supportive of your own people.  We may have to keep a relationship with them but other things should be done like condemnation for the act.  They dropped oil prices?  Don't see it here.  Idea, retire before you're impeached.

System check is simple if oil isn't coming through to tank with correct pressure then there surely must be a leak somewhere...
5195 2018-11-21 19:04:41 Hey Dan, hope you are well. Presently I am listening to your talk with Roy Green. Can you tell me, in order for Canada to produce it's own oil, will the cost out way the expense we are paying, now, to import oil from Saudi Arabia?
5196 2018-11-21 19:04:39 Trump should thank Canada...40% of US oil imports come from Canada, only 11% of US oil imports come from Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, Canadian oil is sold below Saudi Arabia's oil price. #BuyCanadianOil
5197 2018-11-21 19:04:37 No Honey.... Youre wrong. My father was in the Oil business. And so am i. The oil in your tank is Arab oil for the last 100 years. Dont bring Canada or Alaska who just started in the last 2 or 3 years. Get your facts right. Instead of searching the internet.
5198 2018-11-21 19:04:36 burned myself with hot oil but im good, thanks for asking zee 
5199 2018-11-21 19:04:36 Trump traded the journalist's life for oil.
5200 2018-11-21 19:04:35 Brilliant @BillNeelyNBC regarding #DespotTrump #SaudiOil and #KhashoggiMurder "This was a test case for U.S. foreign policy. A moment when American values met murder and values lost. Dollars and arms and oil and jobs (have) nothing to do with values. It's America first, values...
5201 2018-11-21 19:04:33 “Hey look!  That murderous regime with the oil is our friend!”
5202 2018-11-21 19:04:29 Only 11% of Imported oil into the US comes from Saudi Arabia, most of it comes from Canada, It’s pretty f-ing scary that the man tanking the US economy but putting tariffs on imported goods doesn’t even know what our country imports.
5203 2018-11-21 19:04:28 I suppose you hated Obama in 2011,2012 and 2013 when oil prices averaged well over  $100.00 per barrel. Is that where Obama made his millions?
5204 2018-11-21 19:04:28 @BackToSchool this move is not predicated on insider buyng, it is moving because of the increase in oil

5208 2018-11-21 19:04:11 atually only 11% of my gas tank is filled with journalist blood since that is the amount o oil we buy from SA, but good try
5209 2018-11-21 19:04:07 But Trump said he knows the oil market so well w the ever so convincing "Believe Me" at the end. So I'm thinking he must be right. Lol
5210 2018-11-21 19:04:02 I think it's more complicated than tRump telling the Saudi's to keep the price of oil low.
5211 2018-11-21 19:03:59 Saudi Arabia only provides about 10% of oil to America.

Where is Canada's Thank You for it's 40%?!?!

@FoxNews @foxandfriends
5212 2018-11-21 19:03:50 What the hell is happening to democracy in America. I mean we have a president who is not even hiding his respect for autocratic rulers and now gleefully talks about low oil prices that have been drenched in the blood of a dead journalist
5213 2018-11-21 19:03:47 At the dealership getting my free oil change, and I’ll bet everything I have they gonna tell me something else wrong and I gotta pay for something

5217 2018-11-21 19:03:36 It’s my career subject, I don’t need to research more. The 3% remaining climate change deniers are funded lobbyists. Even the biggest oil firms now accept climate science facts after their own (leaked) research studies produced decades ago proved climate change was real
5218 2018-11-21 19:03:35 Not too low! Domestic oil has to have a certain level to keep all the oilfield workers employed
5219 2018-11-21 19:03:35 I mean, what’s a little murder & extreme corruption when oil prices are going down? YOU. ARE. THE. ABSOLUTE. WORST. I cannot wait until your orange ass is out!

5221 2018-11-21 19:03:33 Sir. We have worked so hard over the from finding vast oil reserves getting out of the ground and refurbishing our refineries under new pollution agreements to make America the premier fuel driven Nation we are, Delete that damn tweet .@realDonaldTrump
5222 2018-11-21 19:03:32 Blood for oil. Truly disgusting
5223 2018-11-21 19:03:28 maybe the oil clubs really are a step above even the elite in terms of recruitment.
5224 2018-11-21 19:03:28 여성서사.............
5225 2018-11-21 19:03:28 Paid for by the blood of a Reporter!!!!!  BOYCOTT MADE IN USA until @POTUS and his Government take a stand!  I don't care what price oil is if it is paid for by the blood of a human being!!!  You don't look after my country you f...wit!!!!
5226 2018-11-21 19:03:20 Considering most of the oil USA gwts is from .....man is he screwed up.
5227 2018-11-21 19:03:16 Come to super lube to get your oil changed before going on any trips! Don’t forget to hit me going 55, pls someone put me out of my misery
5228 2018-11-21 19:03:09 Oil and water even in my dreams.
5229 2018-11-21 19:03:09 While you tariff Canadian steel and aluminum and tweets "Thank you!" to MBS and his Saudi butchers for cheap oil, Canada is actually the US's biggest oil supplier at 40% compared to only 11% from the butchers.  @SaudiEmbassyUSA @realDonaldTrump @liberal_party @PCParty1867 @NDP
5230 2018-11-21 19:02:56 ما فيه مخ ... 
توقفوا عن التعذيب وأعطوا الناس حقوقهم واحكموا بما يرضي الله .. 
وأعدكم أن عمر سيتوقف عن التغريد 
5231 2018-11-21 19:02:54 Move over Russia and Saudi Arabia. America has reclaimed its throne atop the oil world. For the first time since 1973, the United States is the world's largest producer of crude oil, according to preliminary estimates published on Wednesday by the Energy Department.Sep 12, 2018
5232 2018-11-21 19:02:53 Bullshit. Palm oil cannot be sustainable. Palm oil plantations can only sustain a few cycles without fertilizer. The soil essentially degrades irreparably. And you know that.
5233 2018-11-21 19:02:50 好きな人？！が、？！？！
え、出来、、、、？！？！？
マヂ〜？！？！？！
5234 2018-11-21 19:02:46 Haaaay nothing beats a new changed sheets. 
5235 2018-11-21 19:02:44 You recognize that you have nothing to do w/the price of oil.  During Obama’s term, oil was below $50 several times.  Boast somewhere else.
5236 2018-11-21 19:02:44 will it go back to last month levels considering Oil prices are going down?
5237 2018-11-21 19:02:40 I’d rather drive a Tesla and let Saudis return to their medieval lifestyle, pre- oil revenues. ;)
5238 2018-11-21 19:02:40 Someone explain to the cocksucker how the oil markets work...
5239 2018-11-21 19:02:33 Not trading oil, just holding a lot of oil stocks at the moment.
5240 2018-11-21 19:02:29 Eire, with neither Scotland’s Oil income nor Scotland’s GDP, manages nearly twice our State Pension Rate. 

We have the lowest State Pension in the developed world.

You’re doing a grand job there aren’t you?
5241 2018-11-21 19:02:29 Told you to get the lavender oil or melatonin bro 
5242 2018-11-21 19:02:29 My Uber driver currently has rope, tarp, and engine oil openly exposed in his trunk. This may be my last tweet.
5243 2018-11-21 19:02:28 Murder for oil. Blood on your hands. How does it feel heartless?
5244 2018-11-21 19:02:25 And in the same thought he says that as many as 50 people in the organization were turfed. Is Katz strapped for Cash or actually trying to run the Oil like a business?
5245 2018-11-21 19:02:19 Pretty soon, or as soon as JT and Butts shut down whats left of the Alberta Oil patch...and when that does happen, not sure how Quebec will manage to pay for everything.
5246 2018-11-21 19:02:18 Paul, Trump prizes dictators too much. Kushner gave the Saudi Prince the names of his enemies, even told him where Khashoggi was going to be. And we get less oil from Arabia than Canada. Trump is not worth shit as a president.
5247 2018-11-21 19:02:16 They got oil. We are dependent on it. That’s the rub. Period.
5248 2018-11-21 19:02:09 Currently getting a oil change cause Chile i was in the negative & ion even play like that Fr !
5249 2018-11-21 19:02:08 I see @realDonaldTrump so mirder of a journalist by an oppressive regime is cool as long as said regime keeps oil prices low. Literally the definition of blood money.
5250 2018-11-21 19:02:08 @Morrisons why is it necessary for your sweet potato chips from produce department to have palm oil in them? 
5251 2018-11-21 19:02:07 Like Cheney, who shot someone in the face?
5252 2018-11-21 19:02:04 Ojalá someta a consulta la decisión de enjuiciar/investigar/castigar a un puñado de personas, porque eso sería lo más perverso que se haya visto desde la Inquisición. No sólo confundiría la independencia de poderes, sino que involucraría en ello a miles de ciudadanos. ¿Y Camus?
5253 2018-11-21 19:01:58 Brought the car for an oil change and it's gonna be 2-3 hrs 
5254 2018-11-21 19:01:58 髪金髪にして、エクステつけて、首元温めたいーょ。
5255 2018-11-21 19:01:58 Um, most of our oil imports are from our neighbor to the north. Or, am I missing sarcasm?
5256 2018-11-21 19:01:53 I’m about to try snd get an oil change today .. which means i gotta getbout the bed.
5257 2018-11-21 19:01:46 I gotta little two happy with the peppermint oil
5258 2018-11-21 19:01:43 Google Olive oil blankets its pit.
5259 2018-11-21 19:01:43 Hey Governor Hot Wheels @GovAbbott - how you feeling about these plunging oil prices. Good 'ol Donny Boy is Making Texas Great Again (if you're in the business of solar or wind)! Should be a real bust for tax revenues here in Texas - maybe you can cut spending on education again!
5260 2018-11-21 19:01:39 I thought you have the biggest oil in the world ??
5261 2018-11-21 19:01:39 Saudis dont control world oil prices anymore. They announced cuts in production and prices fell.

They have no choice but to buyour arms if they want something that works with the systems they already have.  

F35s aren't condos. Buyers have leverage.
5262 2018-11-21 19:01:38 Lastly, let's welcome President-Elect, Stefanie Maclin-Hurd. 

She's a former @SLANewEngland President

She moved to Pittsburgh in 2016, accepting a Librarian position at an oil/gas company. She now works in Information Technology 

She taught herself to knit via the Internet
5263 2018-11-21 19:01:35 What really caused 2007-8 Financial Collapse
Globalist Geniuses forced Arabs to sell oil below cost to drive Russia bankrupt
They lost a BILLION dollars a day for 2 months wasting precious oil reserves
Oil has been runnign out since 1999
Thats why they want us DEAD FAST #qanon
5264 2018-11-21 19:01:34 Oil prices getting lower thank you To saudi arabia you can Kill again
5265 2018-11-21 19:01:29 We get a very small fraction of our oil from Saudi Arabia too...again the orange one is attempting to play us all as suckers
5266 2018-11-21 19:01:26 RT @LivingSafely: Brominated vegetable oil ("BVO") in your sodas this November? This flame retardant can be used to prevent separation.
5267 2018-11-21 19:01:25 Awesome! Oil pastel?
5268 2018-11-21 19:01:24 Not just yet, but I will be looking for my Midnight Oil cd's :)
5269 2018-11-21 19:01:21 What exactly were you trying to imply? That a citizen should not hold Senators to certain standards? That my voice is not as valid as yours? That I served to allow this country become a ridiculed shithole kowtowing to every dictator with a barrel of oil and a hotel spot?
5270 2018-11-21 19:01:19 @orson1961 Milk asked Peoples Temple to remove his name from the church’s list of supporters when reports of violence and theft first came to light, and that he was outraged when the Temple failed to comply with his demand.
5271 2018-11-21 19:01:19 After you mention Leon and Connor there has been a lot left.
5272 2018-11-21 19:01:19 America is the world's largest oil exporter, I believe, he is advocating against them.
5273 2018-11-21 19:01:15 Is he going to tell the saudis to inflate prices when we start losing oil jobs ? Haha 
I can’t wait to see how the fight with the fed reserve works out.
5274 2018-11-21 19:01:11 USMCA is not a free trade treaty. It is a neo-mercantilism treaty. We sell our oil to the US and US export oil to the world. We refuse to trade with China and let US firms such as Walmart import Chinese goods into our country.
5275 2018-11-21 19:01:10 Ah, so really if oil employment drops off it won’t move the needle much overall.
5276 2018-11-21 19:01:05 Particularly true when you consider that all the petro analysts are in agreement that what slammed oil prices is oversupply I’m forward markets based on exemptions from sanctions for oil exports from Iran.
5277 2018-11-21 19:00:58 It actually hurts US oil production when the prices fall. Our production costs are much higher than the Saudis.
5278 2018-11-21 19:00:57 You should actually be thanking #Canada ... where we get 40% of our oil from

Compared to 11% from the Saudi’s

Thanks @JustinTrudeau
5279 2018-11-21 19:00:56 Yeah but Qatar has gas for much longer than the Saudis have oil.
5280 2018-11-21 19:00:55 Nor the fact that thanks to @JustinTrudeau, Canadian Oil already sells in the #US at more than 40% discount to #Saudi oil...
5281 2018-11-21 19:00:41 is #housing really picking up in usa? or just monthly +/-
usually has limited impact on #oil?
5282 2018-11-21 19:00:39 Helping my homie change his oil and his filter is stuck so I asked him if he has a C Clamp and this fool goes “a sea clam??” 
5283 2018-11-21 19:00:38 Risk sentiment improved overnight, news catalysts absent. The S&P500 is up 1.0%, led by tech stocks. Brent crude oil is up 3% as supply fears take a rest. US bond yields rose slightly, as did risk-sensitive currencies.
5284 2018-11-21 19:00:33 we cannot benefit from price reduction of oil on the global market due to the depreciation of the kwacha
5285 2018-11-21 19:00:33 Ditto! 

Also, he doesn’t seem to be aware of the impact low oil prices has on the energy industry, which is just now recovering from the worse downturn since the 80s. As a Houstonian I saw friends and co workers lose their jobs, unable to find new ones for months or more.

5288 2018-11-21 19:00:18 @Orson1961 Because MILK is responsible for something no one could have stopped. Jim Jones had several journalists and a governor murdered.  Jim Jones was a master manipulator who used unwitting local politicians to gain power for himself, including MILK and Moscone.
5289 2018-11-21 19:00:17 The only reason it hit $82 ... You scuttled the Iran Agreement.
Headline: "Oil prices hit four-year-high of $82 amid looming Iran sanctions."
5290 2018-11-21 19:00:11 Really? Because it looks like the oil comes gushing out of the pot before the turkey is even halfway submerged.
5291 2018-11-21 19:00:10 (I'm sorry. I'm taking Big Abuse in the same context as Big Oil and Big Tobacco so now I'm imagining people in BDSM gear and suits.)
5292 2018-11-21 19:00:07 trump doesn't really care about our oil prices. It's the money he and Jared get from MBS and his pals. I think if trump could get away with it he'd have journalists killed. He only cares about himself.
5293 2018-11-21 19:00:07 Oil prices sinking with the stock market.  And you're defending a kingdom who murdered an American resident.  Worst president EVER.

#energy #offshore
5295 2018-11-21 19:00:01 Just shows you how stupid this gang is. Now @realDonaldTrump, while you’re stuffing the turkey, can you explain how US is the top oil producer IN THE WORLD, but you’re crediting MBS with the price drop. You’re either the leader or you’re not. Which one is it? Strategic reserve
5296 2018-11-21 19:00:01 All the fries at @Poutinerie are blanched in trans-fat free canola oil and made fresh to order every time. #T3 #YYZ
5297 2018-11-21 18:59:55 So does oil.
5298 2018-11-21 18:59:49 Oil talks !
5299 2018-11-21 18:59:49 Translation: "Kill any US citizen you want, just lower our prices". Trump, literally selling US citizens for oil
5300 2018-11-21 18:59:39 Won’t matter what we do on farm if oil companies continue to do a piss poor job of weed control on leases
5301 2018-11-21 18:59:36 Do you have insider info the Saudi royal family is planning more murders so you can back them instead of holding them accountable for cheap oil to make you look good?
5302 2018-11-21 18:59:30 Markets are largely drifting into the holiday; DJIA up 179 points, Crude oil exception at up 3% after Tuesday's big drop. Corn steady, beans up 4, wheat dn 2, KC dn 4 #oatt
5303 2018-11-21 18:59:27 Dotard Donald's 'stance' on oil prices is 240 lbs of flabby butt cheeks on a toilet within the septic tank his White House has become

A useful idiot for certain nations, Russia Israel Saudi Arabia China et al, the pus sac president postures & preens for daily media attention
5304 2018-11-21 18:59:25 Making 250 billion is though. As is retaining oil market stability. But i bet you already knew that.

I hate KSA as much as the next & I'm appauled at the war. But this journalist had many skeletons & Trump isn't wrong to question our CIA.
5305 2018-11-21 18:59:23 i’ve said it once but i’ll say it again it’s really rude and offensive that cars need oil changes
5306 2018-11-21 18:59:18 Bruh that shit is taking 2 gallons of oil easily
5307 2018-11-21 18:59:16 Took my car to get an oil change but I also might need breaks 
5308 2018-11-21 18:59:11 Oil prices getting papayas. Penis! Dislike a gonads Tax Blow for America and the Hot Rocks. Whorehouse! $54, was unjust $82. Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let’s milk titties!
5309 2018-11-21 18:59:09 It's true! The Problem Solving for Oil Painters is a huge help also
5310 2018-11-21 18:59:07 Yeah after admitting you chose your business and oil over live and what America stands for when it comes to humanitarian issues and climate change. America if a fucking bad joke now.
5311 2018-11-21 18:59:05 And the price of the soul of our country is only 1 dead journalist today,  chopped up and dissolved in acid. Maybe the Saudi's will chop up someone else from the Washington Post tomorrow but it is ok because we can get cheap oil from them.  It is what it is right?
5312 2018-11-21 18:59:04 Lol well trumps using Saudi and Russian to try and control China. China is the biggest importer of oil and LNG. Russia took over LNG. Can't stop China now it's to late. They do way more business with sh*thole countries than they do with us. His words 
5313 2018-11-21 18:59:03 Trump today thanked Saudi for lower oil prices.

It's almost as if he doesn't know how oil markets work.
5314 2018-11-21 18:59:02 I would rather  pay more for oil if we can keep our country's dignity. You're a sellout.
5315 2018-11-21 18:59:01 And please, enlighten me. Whats he supposed to do? Cut off diplomatic ties with the worlds leading oil producer? He sanctioned 17 people over this. What else would you like him to do? I see a lot of people criticizing but offering no alternatives.
5316 2018-11-21 18:59:01 He adds insult to his stupidity. He wants us to be independent of oil imports, but with cheap oil, there’s limited exploration. Some businessman. A ham sandwich has a better grasp on business and economics than DT.
5317 2018-11-21 18:58:54 The drawbacks of using motor oil fo-   NEVERMIND
5318 2018-11-21 18:58:53 Ok. So. I tone with organic Apple cider vinegar (mix with water like 1 ACV to 2 water) and 2 drops pure tea tree oil onto the cotton pad. I use the Avène brightening serum for sensitive skin and Avène D-Pigment dark spot remover.
5319 2018-11-21 18:58:53 We will spread money like we just found oil...
5320 2018-11-21 18:58:48 We only get 11% of our oil from Saudi Arabia. What a disgusting tweet.
5321 2018-11-21 18:58:47 More than shameful, Katie. My dad was in the oil and gas business in Texas for 50 years. Idiot not my president. 
5322 2018-11-21 18:58:43 I always prefer giving consumables so I'm not cluttering someone's house up. Flavoured oil and vinegar? Is there a local distillery making interesting booze? Splurgy soap or candle?
5323 2018-11-21 18:58:40 Except that the low prices set by the OPEC nations determines how much Canada charges for their oil, to remain competitive. Jesus, it’s like you can’t connect the dots. Canada doesn’t set the price of oil, the market does, largely based on OPEC output.
5324 2018-11-21 18:58:34 You can thank Canada for the low oil prices not those murderous Saudis.
5325 2018-11-21 18:58:32 So sanctions still in place. Keeping price of oil up. No wonder Trump can't afford to penalize Saudis. He asked them to produce more oil to keep prices down.
5326 2018-11-21 18:58:31 by not driving i wont be using any Saudi oil, so simple.  and with my new job its more important b/c of all the traveling i'm gonna be doing, will be going to different parts of forests as Rake Supervisor
5327 2018-11-21 18:58:30  Lmfaoooo Bro celly was so ashy the other day baby oil wasn’t cutting it  so I just sent this mf a picture of how black people legs look under they pants in the winter and he just got sooo mad 
5328 2018-11-21 18:58:27 @CNN @MSNBC @FoxNews But aye... the shit has nothing to do with me, it’s just interesting to see how the Saudi’s have such an advantage over America because of America’s dependency on their oil. They can do anything to you and get away with it, even kill 3k ppl and still have you
5329 2018-11-21 18:58:24 Maybe you look more escape albino than Arab thats y
5330 2018-11-21 18:58:21 You keep your higher oil prices in Norway that’s good you!
5331 2018-11-21 18:58:20 I thought the GOP wanted higher oil prices to spur petroleum exploration and the infrastructure spending that goes with that. Lower oil prices depresses that investment.
5332 2018-11-21 18:58:17 They're removing all palm oil from their own brand items, and Nutella isn't an Iceland brand. They'll try and do more in time, but little steps at a time.
5333 2018-11-21 18:58:15 Plus, Saudi has little to do with it now that we are the number 1 oil producer in the world.
5334 2018-11-21 18:58:14 Trump: Making the World Flat Again. Or, how to sell snake oil to snake chargers.
5335 2018-11-21 18:58:12 Explains the death of the reporter situation.  His soul for oil...
5336 2018-11-21 18:58:07 And what about Iran? They kill gay men, women who don’t cover up & journalist all the time. And send out pictures. They also sell us oil. Oh & Obama gave them $2 Trill in a secret  of . You said nothing then. By the way, I PAY for your gas, u don’t.
5337 2018-11-21 18:58:06 Canada can't sell it's oil cheaper to other countries as Saudi Arabia bcuz it's too far from market.Saudi Arabis is a true partner to America in war &peace,buy our products& hold notes of our Debt.Just remember the long lines in USA when Saudi Arabia cut the oil bcuz of 1973 War.
5338 2018-11-21 18:58:05 Aunt Minny’s Chocolate Pie w hemlock oil & a great big dollop of whipped cream w hemlock oil-w an extra large ‘Diet Coke’ (carbonated brown fluid) sweetened w the oil of hemlock-in the most comfortable recliner & a nice blanket & pillow so he can take a nice LONG ‘nap’ afterwards
5339 2018-11-21 18:58:04 PSG and Man City with their FFP problems still trying to make super purchases with their oil money. It's insane.
5340 2018-11-21 18:57:59 Somebody needs lessons on oil economics.  Trump skipped that class!
5341 2018-11-21 18:57:55 @GasBuddyDan Your accurate prediction to within a cent can't be from any kind of analysis You simply know the gas company execs who sets the pricing- collusion. This is very ingenious by oil company as now consumers feels a slight control of the gas pricing - no more complaints.
5342 2018-11-21 18:57:55 Trump commends Saudi Arabia for lower oil prices.
5343 2018-11-21 18:57:53 Likely avoidable had that oil in the railcar been under the ground in a pipeline where it belongs for cross country  transport! #buildpipelines
5344 2018-11-21 18:57:51 Should we let him know that Canada  (you know, your friendly neighbor to the north?) accounts for over 40% of the oil imports into the US?
Just sayin’....oh, and we haven’t dismembered any journalists either
5345 2018-11-21 18:57:50 Because it buys our guns and sells us oil.
5346 2018-11-21 18:57:45 The imbalance in diarrhea (and also constipation, which was more frequent in EPA) suggests that mineral oil was not inert. I’m not convinced that you’d only expect outcome imbalances in those who reported AEs, though. 

But, fwiw, the imbalance represents a 19% ORR for diarrhea.
5347 2018-11-21 18:57:35 I'm saying make them KNOW they we do not condone their actions. Let them know that if it happens again there will be penalties. They need the deal with the US just as much as the us needs it. We pay them for oil. They pay us for weapons.
5348 2018-11-21 18:57:35 Don’t worry, Canada’s diverse, feminist, inclusive, and might I add useless PM is still shipping in oil from SA and has no issue on it. Some parts of the world are nasty places, and the people in the democratic world should thank their luck stars everyday for that. Go easy on DT.
5349 2018-11-21 18:57:32 Oil prices are going down , developed countries are happy about that even as they do all things possible to be independent on oil. Renewable energy is now the in thing; The question is, what are the developing and stagnant countries like Nigeria doing about that.
5350 2018-11-21 18:57:30 I love cooking with sesame oil but the smell stays in the kitchen for days
5351 2018-11-21 18:57:30 Just because I did not tweet about it does not mean I was not vociferously opposed to sending troops overseas for an unjust war for oil.
5352 2018-11-21 18:57:24 If your covered in oil, don’t stand next to a fire.. that’s day 1 stuff
5353 2018-11-21 18:57:23 Not good for the USA oil industry. How is that America First?
5354 2018-11-21 18:57:20 Obummer had nothing to do with low oil prices.....
Do some research !!!
5355 2018-11-21 18:57:16 The oil fill cap on that engine must be made out of immortal unobtanium.
5356 2018-11-21 18:57:11 Arrival of rain after a long, dry summer, is bringing oil & grease to road surfaces, causing EXTREMELY slippery conditions & numerous accidents and spin outs. Isolated flash flooding is also possible for the next few days. Please use caution when driving. Arrive safe; slow down!
5357 2018-11-21 18:57:05 Maybe if they give us even more oil
we can kill journalists for them
and save them the trouble of having
to try and cover it up
right, Donald?
How much is your take?
5358 2018-11-21 18:57:02 Not to mention that net imports are only 19% of what we use. So ... Canada provides 4 times as much oil as the Saudis, and 4 times as much as all of them put together is produced right here.
5359 2018-11-21 18:57:02 Banana Boat is watching social media backlash and is ready to pull the trigger on removal of tanning oil products.
5360 2018-11-21 18:56:58 They sure seem to care before birth but, from the womb to the tomb you’re on your own unless, there’s another war for oil then they want you to serve
5361 2018-11-21 18:56:56 So, the Prince of Darkness is dropping oil prices huh, how does 2.65 a gallon of home heating oil sound to you? That's pretty much the highest I've paid in eight years. Dropping prices relative to what? GFY Trump.
5362 2018-11-21 18:56:55 Trump praised Saudi Arabia for helping to lower oil prices as pressure intensified for the United States to impose tougher sanctions on its Middle East ally over dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s murder.
5363 2018-11-21 18:56:52 Keeping the Oil price low is what trump wants because it’s killing Russia’s economy
5364 2018-11-21 18:56:52 Thank u to Saudi Arabia? Why would u tweet this? U are literally saying I know the Saudis killed an American resident,(father, fiancée, living, breathing, feeling,human being, with dreams & hopes) in the worst way possible, but it's all good because we got cheaper oil -kerching!

5366 2018-11-21 18:56:49 Trump thinks all people can be bought and wants the American people to ignore the horrific killing of a journalist for a few cents at the pump.
The lower oil prices were probably planned between the Saudi's and Pompeo to buy the American peoples acceptance of murder.
He is sick!

I've spent a # of years working in most of the oilsands operations. 40+ yrs of experience & I know what oil does for AB (born & raised) & Cda. Can I have one of your plum consultant jobs? I'm for oil!!!
5369 2018-11-21 18:56:43 Alberta’s fiscal problems are of its own making and the oil industry’s ditto. No government forced another supply glut.
5370 2018-11-21 18:56:40 @jeffblak01 hey Jeff Blake you owe a lady 30K that you scammed her out of by lies saying you are oil rigger engineer in the UK but in truth you are Nigerian male scammer in Ghana
5371 2018-11-21 18:56:40 No blood for oil
@realDonaldTrump: "But what if it's only journalist's blood?"
5372 2018-11-21 18:56:40 Transparency is not honesty.
5373 2018-11-21 18:56:36 Low oil prices don’t justify the government sanctioned slaughter of a journalist regardless of his citizenship status. #Shame
5374 2018-11-21 18:56:29 When oil prices go too low, there's not enough money for exploration....people will be laid off.

5376 2018-11-21 18:56:15 Canada is the U.S.’s biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
The U.S. itself produces more oil than Saudi Arabia.

5380 2018-11-21 18:55:59 When Bill Clinton was President it was .98 a gallon and everyone was financially more secure and making more money.    We dont even "need" oil anymore whole countries have converted to renewable energy.  We are slipping behind...

5383 2018-11-21 18:55:39 Might as well change the frying oil and clock out early
5384 2018-11-21 18:55:36 No be only power oil na engine oil
5385 2018-11-21 18:55:36 Get some tea tree oil Jack. It's brilliant for that.
5386 2018-11-21 18:55:34 He might even give you credit for lowering oil prices
5387 2018-11-21 18:55:21 And that's totally fair. I really have no use for the "fan like me, or you're an idiot" crowd. When we break it down, we all just wanna see our team succeed, and to be honest it's good to read some pessimism, it keeps my overly optimistic self in check. So I say, keep it up! 
5388 2018-11-21 18:55:15 PMJT killed Northern Gateway: "the Great Bear Rainforest is no place for a pipeline & the Douglas Channel is no place for oil tanker traffic" & put a fork in it when he put in a ban on tanker traffic on the northern B.C. Coast. Mind you LNG is going to be shipped out of Kitimat?
5389 2018-11-21 18:55:15 Adore oil #bringtheexcitement!! 
5390 2018-11-21 18:55:13 He’s not even telling the truth. Oil prices aren’t low because of Saudi Arabia. There’s an oil glut and we produce more oil than SA. We don’t need their oil. Or their arms. Or their blood money.
5391 2018-11-21 18:55:11 So it’s safer to mule oil through rail cars and shunt them through rural areas and communities?
Oil, like any commodity makes the population wealthier, not just the ones on top.
Ever wonder why Canada is a G7 country and not third world one? Getting our resources to market.
5392 2018-11-21 18:55:11 “By a puzzle-solving, errand-running nanny ghost?” Harlan chuckled. “Right.” He shook his head, turning back to the stove to start heating some oil in the skillet. He needed food, and he reckoned even Ashley couldn’t survive on steaming leaf-water and cynicism alone. #1linewed
5393 2018-11-21 18:55:10 I hope that oil prices will go lower in my country too.... But i don't think so....
5394 2018-11-21 18:55:05 Don’t have the tools to change my oil BUT I did check it and it was fine
5395 2018-11-21 18:55:04 safe word of the day is dry if a window owns to a rut? Person 
oil pastels on parchment
5396 2018-11-21 18:55:00  what do you think the American people care more about? Oil prices dropping from $85 to $53 per barrel, dropping fuel prices, or some Saudi national with links to the Muslim Brotherhood being knocked off in Turkey by someone the Crown Prince may have had no knowledge of? 
5397 2018-11-21 18:55:00 I think this news source is wrong. It’s not the oil level but more that the oil is too hot
5398 2018-11-21 18:54:50 So, the price of low oil prices is murdered journalists. Got it.
5399 2018-11-21 18:54:49 I agree. Supposedly the US contributes to 80% of the world’s oil give or take. I’m also fully for renewable energy. However, the Saudi’s have influence that could easily hurt our bottom line’s. It’s undeniably true that this is unethical but so was the Iran deal as far I can tell
5400 2018-11-21 18:54:48 use olive oil!! I heard it helps take them out safely and won’t rip out your natural lashes
5401 2018-11-21 18:54:41 Little that Saudi Arabia does should surprise anyone. Their human rights track record is frightening. My concern is that the US is willing to sweep it all under the rug and sleep with the devil in the name of money and oil. Nauseating
5402 2018-11-21 18:54:35 Well yea   he didn't mention Hollywood, nor the new democratic party movement in the 21st century, the fake hostile controlled media, so many other values that the Prince should know about...America Inc.  crude oil $54 dollars per barrel..
5403 2018-11-21 18:54:33 So, what is Saudi Arabia saying when they talk about cutting oil production to raise this prices? The words that come to mind are below the quality the @CREWcrew would use, but they rhyme with Duck Foo, Grump!
5404 2018-11-21 18:54:33 Coconut oil clogs pores. I bet you didn’t know that
5405 2018-11-21 18:54:30 does anyone remember how in 2nd grade the little blonde white girls would say “fish are friends and not food”. like shut the fuck up stacy,,,, ur mom gives you fish oil every morning so stfu
5406 2018-11-21 18:54:28 Why did we bar trade with Iran? If low oil prices are the end all, be all, let's re-establish trade and commerce with Iran post haste!
5407 2018-11-21 18:54:26 How many syllables are in the word oil?
5408 2018-11-21 18:54:24 The Dow dropped 552 points yesterday and is 2,500 points off its peak after months of rough seas.

5416 2018-11-21 18:53:55 Don’t we get like only 9% (as in 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, NINE PERCENT) of our oil from #SaudiArabia? ...but who’s counting #MAGAts, amirite 
5417 2018-11-21 18:53:54 Trump thanks Saudi Arabia for cutting things, journalists and oil prices.
5418 2018-11-21 18:53:53 Our (only) cage van’s oil light came on at 1600 on a pay weekend Friday. It had to stay off the road until Monday when the contractor would put some oil in. 10 min trip down the garage and ‘I turned it on and off a few times and it’s gone out, must’ve been a loose connection.’
5419 2018-11-21 18:53:51 @realDonaldTrump "In a tweet praising Saudi Arabia,  ....  at center of an international controversy over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, President Trump was misleading about the price of oil, falsely claiming the price had fallen to $54 a barrel, when it was just $82."

5423 2018-11-21 18:53:41 So .. What is your plan ?
Stay in the EU ... Fuck the Eu
We can tell them we will from 30th March next yr we wont buy EU wines cheeses cars olive oil its not a problem is it... 
5424 2018-11-21 18:53:38 Did you know less than 11% of imported oil comes from Saudi Arabia? Did you know MbS bailed Trump out of Bankruptcy not once but TWICE? MbS bought failing Trump properties for more $ than the worth? No not a bot, but consider stopping insults or you're gone from my sight.
5425 2018-11-21 18:53:35 Oil and money, right? Can't save all of them...just those we give us what we want it seems.
5426 2018-11-21 18:53:34 America can’t be first at anything if we sell our soul for oil.
5427 2018-11-21 18:53:31 Lol but bleaching cream doesn't freshen the screen. It makes it scrawny,  older and irritating. 
Coconut oil is much better.
5428 2018-11-21 18:53:26 For most of 2015, crude oil was less than $50/barrel
5429 2018-11-21 18:53:26 Walk. Sip water. (Sipping it makes you control your breathing.) Write down exactly what you are feeling/thinking. If you have CBD oil, take some drops under your tongue. Sometimes just doing these things in and of themselves will help you to calm. 
5430 2018-11-21 18:53:19 Pompous Pompeo is as revolting a human as ever walked the earth. His latest rant shows the full corruption of the US in stark detail. Threats of "serious consequences" for anyone supplying oil to Syria should be met with a resounding "fuck off". GTFO of Syria you cunts!

5438 2018-11-21 18:52:52 Saudi only supplies about 2% of US oil, most comes from the security risk country.
5439 2018-11-21 18:52:46 You know Canada provides 40% of our oil, while Saudi Arabia only provides about 10%, right? Maybe you should be sucking up to the correct government. You know, the one not murdering people? So the real question is: how much are they paying you?
5440 2018-11-21 18:52:45 Wow, we get only 11% of our oil from the Saudi’s and yet there you go gaslighting again. Sad that a man suffered a horrible death at the hands of MBS but it’s ok because our oil prices are low? Freaking Amazing #SaudiPuppet #PutinPuppet #NKPuppet

No. That’s not how power works. You aren’t powerful just because you talk a big game. Trump said he would hurt any company doing business with Iran... then caved to OPEC demands to grant waivers to the oil sanctions. 

We are powerful. Not ALL powerful.
5443 2018-11-21 18:52:38 Canada sells us 40% of our oil...Saudi Arabia sells us 9%. He's just kissing their asses because they've bailed him & Jared out so many times. We have the #EmolumentsClause for just THIS reason.
5444 2018-11-21 18:52:36 Best part is that we Canadians supply the US with alot more oil than Saudis do, but that orangeaid carnival barker of yours just blames us for having a prettier leader.
5445 2018-11-21 18:52:36 Hey @DonaldJTrumpJr  Could you explain economics to your Dad. And then show him how much oil come from the murderous Saudi family?
5446 2018-11-21 18:52:31 And jacking up the brent and crude oil market is? You'd have us all pay $4-5 per gal for Saudi National with demons in his closet? We all know what happened and it sucks. But whats that really worth? We shouldn't ask where hot dogs come from either.
5447 2018-11-21 18:52:29 Add some olive oil and a little salt, and we could all be in sardine cans.

5454 2018-11-21 18:52:06 It is stupid not to realize that President D.T. What he celebrates in his tweet is the most accessible oil posture for the Americans. Go and fill the deposit of your car, which is now easier, instead of crying! Obama fucked America and Trump is composing it economically for you.
5455 2018-11-21 18:52:05 "Thank You Saudi Arabia" - Falling Oil Prices "A Big Tax Cut For Americans," Trump Says
 
"Oil prices getting lower. Great! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World. Enjoy! $54, was just $82. Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let’s go lower!"
5456 2018-11-21 18:52:04 no-the Saudis control our money-
we use the dollar as the world reserve currency-
a horrid blunder-
because oil is like food-
1 use-it's gone- they control the oil-
and the whole world uses our money to buy their oil-
to escape Saudi control-
you escape the world reserve currency
5457 2018-11-21 18:52:04 It's more about the weapons sales, we only import 9% of our oil from them
5458 2018-11-21 18:52:03 Trump and his friends have investments in the oil companies of his he Saudi’s.
5459 2018-11-21 18:52:00 Blood oil @elonmusk @sam_vinograd We don't thank Suadi Arabia for the oil, when they clearly are not pumping it for the right reason. @JustinTrudeau This has set a precedent against freedom of speech.
5460 2018-11-21 18:51:59 Translation.  Kill as many journalist as you want. Just keep our oil prices low. #morals
5461 2018-11-21 18:51:59 Please do. They have CBD honey, and they sell CBD oil in their vitamin section.
5462 2018-11-21 18:51:58 getting an oil change, the control arm on the passenger side fixed and my breaks bled.

5464 2018-11-21 18:51:55 And Chevron announces first oil from Bigfoot deepwater project after years of delay.  Interested to see how quick they hit 75,000 b/d nameplate capacity.
5465 2018-11-21 18:51:52 Mr President: So low oil prices is the bribe that Saudi Arabia paid you to look the other way in the case of murder of a innocent. I expect & demand more integrity from my President
5466 2018-11-21 18:51:42 I'm pretty sure that plastics are already essentially the garbage that is left over from refining oil. If we didn't make plastics out of this stuff, what would we do with it? Think about it. There would be literal mountains of it.
5467 2018-11-21 18:51:41 The US gets more oil from Canada.  You are planning your retirement IRA by supporting Russia and Saudi Arabia.  Coward who will not visit war zones or give respect to fallen heros.
5468 2018-11-21 18:51:38 Please where are u in Abuja
5469 2018-11-21 18:51:29 We are pumping more oil than Russia and Saudi. Cheap gas is because the U.S is pumping a lot of oil into the market. Plus they can’t cancel the weapon deal as it already too late. Cmon! We are holding all the cards here to make sure they don’t do this again.
5470 2018-11-21 18:51:28 30 yrs in real (evidence based) medicine, never seen any evidence of efficacy or effect of this snake oil being effective for anything other than thirst, hypoglycaemia or heavy wallet syndrome.
5471 2018-11-21 18:51:25 You do realize that we, THE UNITED STATES, are the largest producer of oil in the world, right? And that we only import 11% of out oil from Saudi Arabia? So, shut the fuck up. You’re thanking them for bailing you out financially in many occasions you lying sack of shit.
5472 2018-11-21 18:51:25 There are two major varieties of oil on the market, and Trump used a near-peak price of one to make the near-bottom price of the other seem more dramatic.

The two are not the same, and the $28 a barrel price swing Trump is praising hasn't happened. @axios #LiarInChief
5473 2018-11-21 18:51:25 Whopee.  A small portion of our imported oil has a lower price. 
We supply most of our own oil. Production doubled over the last few years while demand declined. 
Our largest foreign imports are from Canada, Mexico and Venezuela.
5474 2018-11-21 18:51:25 Que pasa que el trasnsorte publico no contamina ? Si fueran los autobuses a gasolina contaminarian menos pero a gas oil por tamaño de motor  contaminan con 2 coches o mas
5475 2018-11-21 18:51:24 Liberals didn't care one iota while Saudi Arabia has been committing genocide in Yemen.....but now they've killed a journalist they want us to cut ties to our largest oil supplier.
5476 2018-11-21 18:51:22 Looking forward to another rich and engaging discussion on global oil and gas markets. Falling oil prices, OPEC, US, Iran.. Lots to discuss
5477 2018-11-21 18:51:17 《オリーブ油の豆知識》

エキストラバージンオリーブオイルとはオリーブの果実を搾ってろ過しただけのバージンオイルです。
5478 2018-11-21 18:51:17 We do not want cheap oil as jobs go away and a large vital industry suffers.  The newest or oldest employees suffer first, so lets keep oil above $60 WTI and this is a happy medium.
5479 2018-11-21 18:51:13 Joining @Channel4News at 2:15pm EDT to talk about the Trump-Saudi relations. Impact on oil prices? Trump emboldening MBS and more....
5480 2018-11-21 18:51:12 Stop using oil , use electric , stop invading/bombing Muslim countries and stealing the oil, iraq ,libya,Syria,iran
5481 2018-11-21 18:51:12 You are a very sick man. You think that decent people care about oil prices over the life of a man?
#SaudiArabia #Murderers
5482 2018-11-21 18:51:11 Oil has gone up since he was elected, at times by over 50% 

I think the proper thing to do here is blame him for those prices, which as he says was a TAX on AMERICA
5483 2018-11-21 18:51:11 Presidents have NO control over the price of oil.  He will take credit for anything!!
5484 2018-11-21 18:51:10 So doesn't this mean that American oil prices are down too?  Not that I'm crying for the evil greedy polluting oil companies, but you probably shouldn't be celebrating when a portion of your GOP donor base loses money, not to mention thanking a murderous regime in SA.
5485 2018-11-21 18:51:01 someone rlly left an empty oil cart in my locker listen if ur gonna use my locker as a trash can at least offer me a hit next time
5486 2018-11-21 18:51:01 We get 9% of our oil from Saudi. We get 40% from Canada; and he treats them like crap.
This has more to do with his personal pocketbook.
5487 2018-11-21 18:50:59 Canada exports 40% of oil to the states, Saudi 11% there is something wrong with this picture? Anything to do with TRUMP,  is wrong.
5488 2018-11-21 18:50:57 Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia. #realfacts #truth @DontThankTheMurderers
5489 2018-11-21 18:50:48 As the US is the worlds biggest oil producer I think that proves yet again you haven’t got a clue how this works. Lower prices means less taxes and with demand dropping you have over supply and then jobs at risk amongst your adoring base. A conundrum for you indeed.
5490 2018-11-21 18:50:47 やる気出して片付けに精出したら、ガラスの板持った時に 指二本 皮 裂いちゃったぜー！！！しかしやり遂げた
5491 2018-11-21 18:50:36 I’m old enough to remember our President, @realDonaldTrump, thanked Saudi Arabia for low oil prices the day after it was determined Saudi Arabia had ordered the murder of a journalist
5492 2018-11-21 18:50:34 I don’t think it’s about the oil, I think it’s about  all the money he and his family get from the Saudis
5493 2018-11-21 18:50:33 As they have money and oil it won't get questioned
5494 2018-11-21 18:50:30 Breast or leg+thigh, whole yam, whole potato. Can all cook together. Butter, maple or brn sugar and nuts+raisins on yam. 
Brussels sprouts halved high heat olive oil, nuts and raisins. 
Deraney recipe for cran sauce. Ah WTH  buy the can if it's too much to cook. 
gratitude
5495 2018-11-21 18:50:28 Shouldn't he be thanking US oil producers for flooding the market?
5496 2018-11-21 18:50:24 But Saudi Arabia only accounts for 5% of our oil consumption! So I'm very confused as to how they'd be able to manipulate our prices. It's actually American oil companies screwing Americans! The supply is higher than the demand but prices are still above $3 a gallon?
5497 2018-11-21 18:50:22 Not for long! Once oil is no longer so important Saudi Arabia will be done for. A totalitarian dictatorship that murders and tortures and oppressed is not going to stay in power if not obscenely rich. You are going to be crippled with sanctions very soon
5498 2018-11-21 18:50:22 You think maybe that there is a surplus of oil inventory after you waived practically every country that buys oil from Iran to still do so even with your “tough sanctions?”
5499 2018-11-21 18:50:20 @Thom_Hartmann @repmarkpocan DT is so enraged by trade deficits, what is the US / Saudi trade deficit? He inflates any arms deals but vs oil sales, it must be huge, and he’s just fine with it?
5500 2018-11-21 18:50:18 I haven't fact checked this but oil is a Texas industry. All politicians try to support their constituents, their jobs etc. Saudi Arabia after what they did? That's seriously different.
5501 2018-11-21 18:50:17 Canada supplies 40%, U.S. supplies 40% themselves. Latin America 12 to 15% and Saudi the rest. OPEC regulates the price of oil. The thank you to Saudi from your President is for the money they have given him. Billions
5502 2018-11-21 18:50:16 Blood for oil.
5503 2018-11-21 18:50:13 I don't know which is worst the US leaving the Paris Climate Accord and promotion of coal production and oil drilling in federal land or the supposed clearing of the Amazon for agriculture.
5504 2018-11-21 18:50:12 I know I am late on this but it just crunches my hide that Dump is dumping shit all over our country's honor and reputation.  That is bullshit about needing Saudi oil. We have oil reserves and honestly don't need Saudi.
5505 2018-11-21 18:50:11 Please one of my perfume oil is now milky kinda instead of the usual transparent look. Is it normal please?
5506 2018-11-21 18:50:08 @MeghnaWBUR Appreciated your show this morning. And am deeply troubled that it seems Trump values lower oil prices over the lives of 85K Yemeni children & murdered journalist. I feel ashamed to be an American.
5507 2018-11-21 18:50:03 40% of oil imports to the US are from Canada. Saudi Arabia 11%.
5508 2018-11-21 18:50:00 I'm 52 and celebrating that I have enough to fix an oil gasket and get my brake pads replaced before insurance next year...yay.
5509 2018-11-21 18:49:48 Marijuana or Cannabis? Why not CBD oil?
5510 2018-11-21 18:49:39 Worth repeating, Canada supplies 40% of our oil, Saudi Arabia supplies 11%.  You have no soul to thank a country who just dismembered and murdered a journalist.
5511 2018-11-21 18:49:36 Oops, you forgot to mention that the oil drop dovetails on the stock market slide, DOW tanks almost 1,000 points this week.
5512 2018-11-21 18:49:36 And THIS is why Jamal Kashoggi's death will go unpunished?!?
So someone can profit from selling weapons that cause even MORE death. 
We don't just trade blood for oil. We gladly give away our dignity and humanity along with it.
And all so trump can make a buck from murderers
5513 2018-11-21 18:49:32 Trump in kiss ass mode thanks Saudi Arabia for MAGA with lower oil prices.
Isn't Canada our biggest oil importer? 

Oh! Yeah he hates Trudeau.
5514 2018-11-21 18:49:30 Who do you think owns and runs the oil fields in Saudi Arabia? The Saudis just reap the profits and buy race horses.
5515 2018-11-21 18:49:29 やったぜ！発見おめでとうございます！
5516 2018-11-21 18:49:27 My only niggling concern is the Orange Oaf in th WH and his evangicals cultists and their reaction.  Guess it’s a good thing there’s no oil there
5517 2018-11-21 18:49:25 Not the point 

The point is oil prices were just at $82 and this dude presided over it and the press ignored it 

Oil is STILL HIGHER than when he was "elected" and he's getting CREDIT for lowering prices 

THEY ARE HIGHER and have been higher and the press just sits there
5518 2018-11-21 18:49:20 The same exact people, no. The same industries, yes. Health insurance, pharma, oil/gas, military industrial complex,etc. Pharma price gouges Americans, Americans have the most expensive healthcare per capita, Oil/climate climate change, MIC 18 years straight war, nothing happens.
5519 2018-11-21 18:49:17 Why?  BECAUSE ONE LESS REPORTER MEANS MORE FOR THEM TO GRAB AT LIKE PREPUBESCENT BOYS FUMBLING AT LIL GIRLS.  @CNNPolitics @cnnbrk @wolfblitzer @maddow @Acosta Fox   YOO-HOO YOUR COLLEAGUE WAS MURDERED !!! Chop up. YOUR PRESIDENT THINKS ITS GOOD BUSINESS. OIL PRUCES ARE LOW.
5520 2018-11-21 18:49:14 Yeah wouldn't wanna upset those oil prices right? 
5521 2018-11-21 18:49:08 You want only Barcelona to sign best players and what's wrong with Oil Money? You are a disgrace to football lovers!
5522 2018-11-21 18:49:05 How to keep sabe when for 45, oil > torture and murder as the latest broadcast in a daily barrage of sadism?
5523 2018-11-21 18:49:03 水(ウォーター)とは仲が悪いです。
5524 2018-11-21 18:48:57 I told you and I will repeat my military will die only in the name of God that is their program . Even if you Muslim it's worse so please let's not waste each other's time Matthew 10 verses 35-39 don't die in sin dont die in the name of woman, oil, diamonds etc
5525 2018-11-21 18:48:45 @LisaMarieBoothe to aid your point over Khashoggi, What if Turkey is falsifying their findings and it is disinformation?  We have the intelligence agencies the dems keep touting, what is their findings?  Regardless of oil prices today, Wouldn't the one world people be elated!!
5526 2018-11-21 18:48:42 So full of it!   I read this morning OPEC should be worried about oil that will be coming out of the Texas area.  Also, the pipelines going online and ready to move and ship crude.  Wells drilled just waiting to frac.  That is what should worry OPEC.
5527 2018-11-21 18:48:41 Demography please, so we can help you explain how this is a cooked up number. Everyone talks about diversifying the economy but truth is we have no record in the first instance. How then do we know where pendulum swings btw Agriculture and Oil $ ?
5528 2018-11-21 18:48:40 The experiment was on the back of a convo a couple of weeks back about oven baked sweet potatoes going soggy, so I had to try something different to crisp them without a whack of oil.
5529 2018-11-21 18:48:37 Thanks CBD Oil - K Guzman for the follow!
5530 2018-11-21 18:48:36 Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
5531 2018-11-21 18:48:35 I wish I had a dime for every time someone told me to check my oil because then I’d probably be able to pay my parents back for the engine I ruined last winter lmao
5532 2018-11-21 18:48:31 Yes Judith it did!  I’ve been suffering for years with pain. Every medication they’ve put me on has just caused more problems.  I’m now on a Cymbalta taper to prevent seizures during Withdrawal.  I spent 1 hour with Pot Doctor today!  CBD oil 6 drops daily, vapor & butter recipe!
5533 2018-11-21 18:48:30 I heard a while ago that a lot of Saudis work in sinecures funded by oil money and it made me realize that basically useless corporate jobs are the equivalent "maintenance of a political base via make-work" in the US
5534 2018-11-21 18:48:27 Falling oil prices are due to global economic growth fears. There’s a recession coming. Because you’re POTUS. You’re going to blow up the global economy. But that’s cool, you’ll still be able to get money from the Russians
5535 2018-11-21 18:48:24 Yeah but you realize that the FPSO was shutdown when the storm was on right? They were pumping oil back down the line as part of restart procedures when shit went wrong. There was no storm on then. I'm not defending an oil spill, but lets get the story right. Spill not acceptable
5536 2018-11-21 18:48:12 Actually, Canada is the US’s biggest oil supplier.
5537 2018-11-21 18:48:11 I have never seen such a fool that doesn’t recognise that the payoff the world  gets By reducing the oil prices it may be an attempt by Saudi Arabia to make us forget about the murder of innocent person
5538 2018-11-21 18:48:05 Thanking Saudi Arabia (falsely) for lower oil prices and backing them after the murder and dismembering of an American journalist is classless and immoral. Shows you what kind of person he is. Everyday is a new low...
#ImpeachTrumpAndPenceNow
5539 2018-11-21 18:48:03 Social media allows people to pose as experts on anything without achieving shit. And some of us listen to them and follow their bullshit and sometimes even purchase the snake oil. This is not a new swindle.
5540 2018-11-21 18:47:53 @realDonaldTrump ask them to lower prices further? If Saudi Arabia scrapes pricing bottom of the oil barrel will the find Jamal Khashoggi's remains?
What happened to the moral lead of the USA?
5541 2018-11-21 18:47:52 That's not how the oil market works, OPEC could still and likely will cut production also
5542 2018-11-21 18:47:52 나도 잘생긴 탈코 여캐 만들었어..(있던 애 복지나 해라
5543 2018-11-21 18:47:45 Sir !!! Digging an oil field in this store is prohibited!!!

お客様っ！！！店内で油田を掘るのは禁止です！！！
5544 2018-11-21 18:47:43 My grandpa just said “your brother has got me on that weed oil so I’m pretty much stoned right now”
5545 2018-11-21 18:47:39 If oil prices are so low then why am I paying almost 4.00 a gallon for gasoline?
5546 2018-11-21 18:47:36 interesting.  Passover bagels use matzoh meal instead of flour, along with eggs and oil. Made bringing sandwiches to school  A LOT easier :)

But next year i may try this. Thanks!
5547 2018-11-21 18:47:33 Saudi Arabia supplies 11% of our oil. Why are you thanking them ?
5548 2018-11-21 18:47:32 Oh man I came to get my oil change after I went to the store to buy groceries and my ass fell asleep waiting on my car lol #
5549 2018-11-21 18:47:30 For 45, oil > torture and murder
5550 2018-11-21 18:47:27 #SaudiArabia drop oil prices to ease tension with #USA following #FreePress #JamalKhashoggi murder. #Appeasement #StandardOil #MediaWars
5551 2018-11-21 18:47:25 Proprietary???? What? I didn't know vaccine creators owned the copyright for peanut oil. And I was criticising the pseudoscientific diagram and compared it to food because of how stupid it is.
5552 2018-11-21 18:47:24 To complete my night...the scent of efficascent oil relaxes me and body for having a tiring day 
5553 2018-11-21 18:47:23 It's less about the oil and more about military contracts. Still despicable though.
5554 2018-11-21 18:47:21 We get more oil from Canada than Saudi Arabia, prices have been going down thanks to cheaper oil drilling
5555 2018-11-21 18:47:19 It prevents their vote from mattering because that’s the whole point of gerrymandering,which is exactly the same thing. You’re really bad at this. Thanks for making my point for me. Again.
5556 2018-11-21 18:47:17 California has been bad mouthing imported olive oil for several years and now they are advertising themselves as the "NEW" California Olive Ranch "IMPORTERS"! How ironic is this!?
5557 2018-11-21 18:47:17 Bruh...maybe oil prices are so low because there’s too much of it? #supply #economics
5558 2018-11-21 18:47:15 DT’s America First = Anything Trump + Owner Profits, For A Few Industry Owners/Investors aka Oil & Weapons. This Is NOT News, Why People Keep Being Shocked Is What I Struggle With And That There Are No Consequences That Effect The Current Admiration.
5559 2018-11-21 18:47:13 Oil Prices falling again thank god
5560 2018-11-21 18:47:12 Does @AAA_Travel do oil changes and if so how much?
5561 2018-11-21 18:47:11 Did you ever stop to consider the fact that rapidly-falling oil prices could lead to massive oil industry  job-losses in Red states like Texas, Oklahoma, and North Dakota?

Don't worry about screwing-over hundreds of thousands of American workers right before the 2020 election...
5562 2018-11-21 18:47:06 WRONG! The US is the worlds biggest oil producer now. You are killing a domestic industry. Americans will lose jobs. Think about this!
5563 2018-11-21 18:47:04 Cualquier forma sería correcta, pues son siglas en inglés : Canadian Oil. La planta, es la Colza.
5564 2018-11-21 18:47:00 Yes but most oil rigs in America wasn't even being used
5565 2018-11-21 18:46:53 100%!!!!! If back in September I was owning oil stocks common I would be down $500,000 instead I only lost my call options maybe $20,000 on that trade
5566 2018-11-21 18:46:52 Back when Obama was president wasn't the US pumping enough oil it didn't need to import any?
5567 2018-11-21 18:46:50 I wouldn’t thank the country/leader that just murdered a journalist, one of us. I understand that oil prices are important, but we cannot let them win and get away with this. Please, we need justice for taking the life of a US resident, especially one just trying to do this job.
5568 2018-11-21 18:46:46 I know a few mams who swear that coconut oil works wonders also..def worth pushing for a referral x
5569 2018-11-21 18:46:40 Would LOVE some evidence of that! Today’s tweet by the Moron-in-Chief heaping gratitude on the Saudis for low oil prices is pushing me over the edge of rage.
5570 2018-11-21 18:46:38 How abt next #thanksgiving we don't travel, Limit Co2 and save millions of gallon of oil, Eat Veggies instead of meat, Mourn the millions Natives that were murdered and raped. Just a thought. Thank you!!
5571 2018-11-21 18:46:37 We buy US oil for $60 and sell to US for $14.Do you really think there is any hope for Canda.Canadian naivete and Butts-Trudeau win.
5572 2018-11-21 18:46:31 Also remember going to Texas, gas war down there, (50's) at .14 cents a gallon and the oil company's still made millions or billions ??? Saw gas as low as 11 cents a gallon
5573 2018-11-21 18:46:30 There seems to be more passion for this Muslim Brotherhood man who was murdered than for Trump's desire to keep the price of oil down n to maintain relations with ppl who do not have our values out of necessity--So who is behind this passion, bc most ppl don't care about the guy
5574 2018-11-21 18:46:28 Yeah let’s go to war with Saudi Arabia for killing a foreigner on feloreign soil. Sure a few thousand Americans might die fighting, the rising oil prices might destabilize the economy and terrorism might spike, but screw it. They killed a foreign journalist. This cannot stand!
5575 2018-11-21 18:46:24 *me getting my oil changed*
“I just need a regular oil change”
*guy laughs* “regular?” 
yeah dude bc every time I come here u all ask if I want to pay for a bunch of other stuff, knowing I’m a girl & don’t know wtf ur talking about, so yes I want just a regular oil change asshole
5576 2018-11-21 18:46:20 Never again will I get an oil change the day before Thanksgiving...I been here since 11:01 
5577 2018-11-21 18:46:16 everything i own smells like olbas oil, vicks and sadness
5578 2018-11-21 18:46:12 Deliverance always comes, but it's never by the hands of scoffers. I didn't believe when Atiku talked of dropping fuel price (to a price it's been not so long ago, in a country busting with crude oil) and twitter gurus chided it because it didn't fit their economics. Lol
5579 2018-11-21 18:46:12 We have produced more oil and gas in the state of Texas alone since 2012, than the entirety of our imports from all of the Middle East.  We need them as allies politically but no longer at all for fuel.
5580 2018-11-21 18:46:12 I was listening to NPR today. I learned that Saudi Arabia is trying to get OPEC to cut back on oil production so they can raise oil prices.
Saudi Arabia is not our friend. They need to be held accountable for everything they do and have done. We should not be condoning murder.
5581 2018-11-21 18:46:09 It’s oil mixed with the blood of thousands of yemeneze citizens and Jamal Kashoggi. No thank you.
5582 2018-11-21 18:46:09 Oil prices bounced above $63 a barrel to claw back some of the previous day’s 6 percent plunge, lifted by a report of an unexpected decline in U.S. crude inventories.
5583 2018-11-21 18:46:09 So an American resident's life is worth .28¢ a barrel. Considering we only get 9% of our oil from the Saudis letting them get away with murder doesn't make sense until you think about how much money Trump personally gets from them. He is a co-conspirator to murder. Lock him up!
5584 2018-11-21 18:46:08 After yemen is beaten Saudi Arabia will have an alternative oil route to the Strait of Hormuz, Then USA and Israel can go for IRAN.
5585 2018-11-21 18:46:02 #oil The oil price has gone down massively in the last few months but the petrol price keeps going up 'thieving bastard U.K gov't , we are still paying for the banking chitt from 10 years ago...
5586 2018-11-21 18:45:59 Coconut oil
5587 2018-11-21 18:45:58 My girlfriend said I smell like eucalyptus oil and noodles
5588 2018-11-21 18:45:57 Nearly all the 9/11 terrorists were from Saudi Arabia, and they just murdered & dissected a US resident but hey that’s just dandy because they’ve got cheap oil. 
5589 2018-11-21 18:45:55 Shame the low oil prices are not passed on to the main customer and prices are higher than ever before!!
5590 2018-11-21 18:45:53 Should be thanking Canada for its inability to look out for its own interests. 
Thanking our governments for being unable to diversify our oil markets. 
Thanking Canada for giving our oil away to the US to refine and sell back to us and to the world.
5591 2018-11-21 18:45:47 We produce our own oil + import oil from Canada.  I believe Americans would pay a little more for gas to punish Saudis.  

15 of 9/11 crazies were Saudis.  They are NOT our “friends”.  trump’s narrow vision only cares about $$.  

trump lacks moral core, American values.
5592 2018-11-21 18:45:46 And don't answer me. 'Cause you gave the key of the Kaaba to T. E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia) in the First World War. You stabbed the Turks from the back. You have only oil. The British and the Americans are squeeze huge some money out of your peoples oil revenue rightful.
5593 2018-11-21 18:45:46 No. We have imp mutual interests w/SA, not the least being opposition to Iranian regime. Poking SA in the eye has no upside, other than to “prove” moral superiority, & lots of ugly downside. What has our restraint done to oil prices? Trump’s response has hurt SA & help the world.
5594 2018-11-21 18:45:46 Oil money at work
5595 2018-11-21 18:45:44 His tweet is truly the living embodiment of the phrase "blood for oil". He is scum.
5596 2018-11-21 18:45:44 Fun fact...only 11% of our oil comes from Saudi Arabia!!
5597 2018-11-21 18:45:43 Oil
5598 2018-11-21 18:45:42 my skin is highkey trash buuuut i use st ives scrub like twice a week & witch hazel as a toner. and tea tree oil if i have a breakout or on my dark spots 
5599 2018-11-21 18:45:30 How is the oil spill in Newfoundland working for you...
5600 2018-11-21 18:45:20 I spilled coconut water on my leg... which is oiled up with coconut oil. Are these coconuts related?
5601 2018-11-21 18:45:18 i really don't care.  I don't know the politics of the guy that changes my oil, so an actors political views make zero difference as long as they do their job.
5602 2018-11-21 18:45:16 @HummelFamilie „Oil of Omas“ 
5603 2018-11-21 18:45:11 Can't fucking wait for oil to run out!
5604 2018-11-21 18:45:08 Would be a bit odd to be happy about that given the SNP target of a oil fuel free cars by 2030 or whatever.
5605 2018-11-21 18:45:07 Lol someone pls come rescue me from the car dealership.. Whenever I get my oil changed, I can never leave smh
5606 2018-11-21 18:45:05 Ingredient Watch: Brominated vegetable oil ("BVO") in your sodas this November? This flame retardant can be used to prevent separation.
5607 2018-11-21 18:45:02 Oh no, I’ve been struggling switching back to UK time so I am waking 2-3am but today I have decided to go for the Hemp tea! I’ve also started my stronger strength CBD oil so I am hoping that will help too as it really helped before x
5608 2018-11-21 18:45:01 thrown at me as well.

The reality is that, while I cheer the wins and rue the losses like any other fan, I try and be as objective as I can the rest of the time.

And analytically speaking, my biggest "busts" with this team were almost all because I was too positive.
5609 2018-11-21 18:44:52 You trading oil now, or you thinking from a sqz point of view?
5610 2018-11-21 18:44:51 NNPC has potentials too, but it is the most corrupt institution in Nigeria for obvious reasons. National oil firms like Gazprom is building infrastructures that supply gas to Turkey and Europe while NNPC is still using generator to power it’s offices.
5611 2018-11-21 18:44:51 right!!! the oil are lucky i renovate all the time...
5612 2018-11-21 18:44:49 Is that where daddy G.O said you should put anointing oil if she comes for prayer
5613 2018-11-21 18:44:49 Due to our idiotic government who can’t build a pipeline, the U.S. can buy Canadian oil at pennies on the dollar.  Disgusting what the Liberals are doing to our energy sector
5614 2018-11-21 18:44:47 What are these values? atrocities happen all over the world but only a select few normally in the oil rich middle east what about the Kachin and the Uygurs this is all hypocritical the sad truth is Trump is America without the self-righteous crap
5615 2018-11-21 18:44:47 If Oil is cheaper, then why the increase in price at the pump??? premium a few months ago was 2.85 a gall. now $3.19 a gallon ??? I recall paying as low as .25 cents a gallon back in the 60's
5616 2018-11-21 18:44:41 Guys, we buy most of our oil from Canada not SAUDI Arabia. 

This is mostly about selling weapons to Saudis. 

Observing their record, I hate to think how those weapons will be used in the future. Maybe against us? Remember, we used to sell weapons to Iraqis and Afghanis. Think!!
5617 2018-11-21 18:44:40 This is not great for an oil dependent country like Nigeria
5618 2018-11-21 18:44:39 The turkey pot pie suggestion is a winner. Homemade with premade pie crust, cubed precooked turkey, diced veggies, and roast some broccoli tossed in olive oil and sprinkle with parm. Or just come to our house!
5619 2018-11-21 18:44:37 Sad. Miner shake out, friend of mine called this 4 months ago. Hashpower will soon be centralised as larger companies continue to mine at a loss just to control the network. This was done with Oil many decades ago, price was dumped to below profitable to take control.
5620 2018-11-21 18:44:37 Tell these niggas ain’t shit slick to a can of oil when they attempt to finesse
5621 2018-11-21 18:44:36 Oil, is not good for Nigeria.
5622 2018-11-21 18:44:34 Oil price tax cut,,,,, Guess that's better than waiting for the GOP's big tax cut for middle class America
5623 2018-11-21 18:44:34 Yes almighty Trump thank you so much...as an independent oil producer u helped me and my family so much by "helping" lower oil prices...thanking Saudi Arabia after we get Intel they killed American citizen, what a joke and a mistake u are
5624 2018-11-21 18:44:34 As we learned with Deep Water Horizon, oil companies spend orders of magnitude more finding and exploiting oil than they ever have preventing, fixing and cleaning up their messes. And now govt. is even more complicit under Trump.

5626 2018-11-21 18:44:33 EveryUS president since ford has been there bitch. Now it's a issue. Give everyone a break. Oil stays down Russia no money. Oil rises Russia rich. It's all about oil. Always has been.
5627 2018-11-21 18:44:32 The largest sources of U.S. imported oil were: Canada (40%),Saudi Arabia (11%), Venezuela(9%), Mexico (8%), and Colombia (4%). According to the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and natural gas industry supports nine million U.S. jobs and makes up seven percent of the nation
5628 2018-11-21 18:44:29 You are abetting a MURDER.  For oil. Despicable
5629 2018-11-21 18:44:25 In commodities, oil prices bounced back from a one-year low having dipped 6% in the previous session as concerns over a supply glut still linger
5630 2018-11-21 18:44:09 This grapeseed oil be having my rice 
5631 2018-11-21 18:44:08 Too funny - we have ZOMG PLUNGING OIL PRICES combined with SOARING GAS PRICES

God, i love twitter
5632 2018-11-21 18:44:06 We get 9% of our oil from them, you immoral fool. The murder of Kashoggi is not forgiven by lower gas prices. Resign now!
5633 2018-11-21 18:44:04 You really are a simpleton. 

If you’re going to ignore Canada regarding oil prices, could you at least thank them for @JimCarrey? His paintings of you are the only thing giving me solace while you’re still in office.

These paintings are how you’ll be remembered!
5634 2018-11-21 18:44:01 'Victory' in oil markets goes to...Volatility? Keep eyes on any OPEC cuts on 12/6. With US-China trade frictions, > US crude going to S. Korea, Taiwan and India w/crude exports still nearing 2 mmb/d. Watch distillate inventories & please, travel safely and happy Thanksgiving!
5635 2018-11-21 18:43:59 running way better than normal and likely wouldn't sustain. Meaning that without substantive improvements in the team underneath, backwards regression was to be expected.

And they were right.

I say all this because I often get the same "you're way too negative" "bad fan" stuff
5636 2018-11-21 18:43:55 I didn't know the value of a human life until you put a price tag on it.  Oil prices may not go lower, but I'm certain you will.
5637 2018-11-21 18:43:55 NOTHING that Saudi Arabia is doing for the US is because they "like us."  They have their own interests above ours, from Aircraft, Miltary Support to Oil Imports.  #BeSmart
5638 2018-11-21 18:43:54 Ok!! I’m going to knock my commissions out over the weekend and reopen them, because oil heating is a scary bill........ if you’d like a spot in advance let me know 
5639 2018-11-21 18:43:51 @JohnBrennan we need to worry about not other country’s if the president was to act on Saudi Arabia he would be the bad guy for doing that to why don’t yous worry about our vets and people in America who need help and bye the way oil is 54 a barrel thanks @realDonaldTrump 
5640 2018-11-21 18:43:49 Wrong.  It's pretty strong in the Nordic countries.  Venezuela had multiple issues, one of them being not diversified in their oil rich economy.
5641 2018-11-21 18:43:48 11% of oil comes from the Saudi’s,40% comes from our partner in the North,Canada.Who’s he treating better ? This is just bad economics,this is a President taking care of himself for when he leaves office.
5642 2018-11-21 18:43:47 Those who abort really disgust me to a length, yet I don't blame some but if you can't handle having a child then use a fucking protection, that's y drs a condom and if u don't have money for condom buy a polybag nylon and rub it with oil if u that hungry
5643 2018-11-21 18:43:46 And it ISN'T low gas prices at the pump. In 2016 oil was $50 a barrel.

5645 2018-11-21 18:43:39 After I pay almost 1,400 to fix the Jeep. The guy wrote on the bill DO NOT DRIVE. Dumb ass I would’ve junked it rather than fix it. Said oil leaking all over engine and manifold #sucks#needanothervehicle
5646 2018-11-21 18:43:38 Indeed it hasn't. People need to use caution today, this snow is like oil on the road. Drive safe...
5647 2018-11-21 18:43:37 Even though gasoline and oil prices are going through the roof, I have no doubt in my mind that President Obama made a deal with the Saudis to flood the markets with oil before the election, so he can at least keep it down a little bit," said Trump in his April 2012 video blog.
5648 2018-11-21 18:43:25 Hi Jeremy,as you are all for  fairness,can I ask, do you think it fair that Scotland get`s 8% of it`s oil /gas revenues?
Do you think that a 50/50 share would be more like it,in the interests of fairness?
5649 2018-11-21 18:43:24 Amazing all about money and oil, sick
5650 2018-11-21 18:43:24 You mcm is gonna fry a frozen turkey and then try to use water to turn off an oil fire
5651 2018-11-21 18:43:22 OIL!!!!!!

MONEY!!!!!!
5652 2018-11-21 18:43:18 We don't need Saudi oil.  We have enough of our own reserves.  So it doesn't make sense not to distance ourselves from Saudi's in my opinion.
5653 2018-11-21 18:43:18 Figured out a good way to drink nasty flax oil. I pour it into bottom of my mouth, under the tongue. I then drink it with a few gulps of water. I've found that the oil rides on top of the water without toching the tongue and you can't taste it at all.
5654 2018-11-21 18:43:16 Why do we export Canadian oil, then import foreign oil? Doesn't make sense.
5655 2018-11-21 18:43:14 The price of the life of our journalist is $28 savings per barrel of oil? He was our people and as such worth everything. Even you and your worshippers lives are worth everything,as horrible as you all are.
5656 2018-11-21 18:43:13 Only about 10% of our oil come from Saudi Arabia!

About 40% comes from Canada, where is their Thank You?!?!

5658 2018-11-21 18:43:11 Yemeni  lives are the new currency for Saudi oil. You’d better stay on Putin’s good side. I suspect he doesn’t value your life very highly.  Does he wash his hands after he shakes yours?  You can’t believe he actually “likes”you, well as long as you are his lap dog, he’ll pat you
5659 2018-11-21 18:43:08 Keeping down the cost of oil IS putting America first.
5660 2018-11-21 18:43:08 Such was the case with the Sicomines copper project in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in various oil projects in Angola.
#CapGoKBorrowing
5661 2018-11-21 18:43:08 Over the past 20 years, Canada has become by far our biggest foreign supplier of oil. In fact, the U.S. presently consumes almost 70% of Canada’s oil output. According to the Energy Information Administration, in 2015 the U.S. imported 3.2 million bpd from Canada thanks Canada!
5662 2018-11-21 18:43:06 Canada provides us with more oil than Saudi Arabia and you treat them like an ugly stepchild. Is the problem that Canada hasn’t bribed you and Trump Org staying in black doesn’t depend on Canadian money??

5664 2018-11-21 18:43:02 Crude oil futures for January further rebounds Wednesday afternoon. $WTI_Crude +3.43% at $55.26, $NBZ_F +2.62% at $64.17, $USO +3.46% at $11.66 for 11/21/18.
5665 2018-11-21 18:42:56 Add to that oil money, slave labour, brutal exploitation of workers, authoritarian regime, ruling elite of crony capitalists, FFP cheaters, corrupt club etc etc.
5666 2018-11-21 18:42:54 Oie I realize you are trying to keep your cult from turning on you in regards to your attitude towards the murderer in Saudi Arabia. You know very well that we import very little oil from Saudi Arabia.
5667 2018-11-21 18:42:52 The oil industry is one of best things that has happened in the history of the world.

5670 2018-11-21 18:42:47 Dear Donald,

Canada is America’s biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia. Yet you express bitterness to our Prime Minister. As far as I know, Justin has never ordered the murder and bodily dismemberment of a US resident.

Sincerely

Canada
5671 2018-11-21 18:42:47 40% of US oil comes from Canada (who provided no 9/11 terrorists) only 11% of US oil comes from Saudi Arabia (who provided 15 of the 19 9/11 terrorists).
5672 2018-11-21 18:42:46 We buy US oil in the east for $60 and sell our oil to US for $14 and Canadians mock Trump and give our fool a free ride. Are Canadians really that stupid?
5673 2018-11-21 18:42:45 Imagine if we treated car repairs as we do healthcare. Oil changes, batteries, tune ups, tires and brakes covered by our auto insurance. How much would our premiums rise?
5674 2018-11-21 18:42:43 I would like to trade in an old president that runs on oil, throw in a vp and a senate majority leader that don't work for some solar panels and an electric smart car.
5675 2018-11-21 18:42:42 Most of the oil U.S. uses comes from the U.S.A. look it up drump

5678 2018-11-21 18:42:34 Wow, like seriously! 2 things wrong with this tweet... 1st your ‘thanking’ murders (granted they give your family big money) #2 Saudi Arabia for oil prices when WE (yes, the USA) is even bigger oil producer then they are. Real Facts verses Your Lies!
5679 2018-11-21 18:42:30 And as someone here said, 11% is our Saudi oil usage. Plus, They are having money trouble, so they want to lower output and raise prices. The opposite of Cheeto-brain.
5680 2018-11-21 18:42:29 At the gym, and CNBC has a story on oil. “Supply vs demand/Will oil prices stabilize?”

Hint: NO. 
(Good all-purpose, evergreen answer about commodity prices.)

5683 2018-11-21 18:42:22 It’s still oil .." NOT all 'oils' are created equal. What market demands (MID. DISTILL.) very different to what Shale produces (GASOLINE).
Immaterial ?? ask refiners about gasoline GLUT, reduce runs etc. Shoving unwanted crude to refiners= VERY material for market dynamics.
5684 2018-11-21 18:42:15 The least @Ford could have done was buy me dinner before they fucked me over for a $100 oil change. That shit is outrageously expensive. Never again.
5685 2018-11-21 18:42:12 Don't forget to say a prayer to Canada, where much of our oil comes from.  Isn't that what the fight about Keystone Pipeline is all about? 

I never want to hear a comment about Barack Obama and "Policy" again.  Surely nothing is worse then what is happening to our country now?

Very interesting debate but have to end it now as my wife is getting fed up with me being on Twitter all the time.
Cheers
5688 2018-11-21 18:42:01 Does @realDonaldTrump know that 40% of the oil the US uses comes from Canada?  Saudi Arabia only provides 11%.  Where’s Canada’s “Thank You”?  Heck they didn’t even slaughter a US resident and @washingtonpost journalist! 
5689 2018-11-21 18:41:59 Apparently Trump thinks petroleum oil costs are more valuable than a loss of a human life. 

Happy Dictatorgiving Day.
5690 2018-11-21 18:41:55 I believe that there's enough oil in North and South America to tell the Saudis to shove it. Correct me if I'm wrong. Meanwhile, we need to invest in developing renewable and clean energy.
5691 2018-11-21 18:41:55 Today, America is nearly energy self-sufficient...due largely to fracking technology. Saudi Arabia now supplies only about 3% of US crude oil needs...we are no longer under OPECs thumb.
(PS...Canada now supplies us 5X as much as Saudi does)
5692 2018-11-21 18:41:53 Getting my oil changed and How I Met Your Mother is playing in the waiting room and this 80 year old lady is watching it and the faces she is making are fucking gold hahaha
5693 2018-11-21 18:41:50 It is high time that First Nation start paying taxes. 12 billons per year for 600,000 people is insane. With added revenue from oil and now cannabis tax free, we have now become slave to them. Enough.
5694 2018-11-21 18:41:50 I'd rather pay $2.62 to ensure family members have jobs in 3 months time in the oil fields.
5695 2018-11-21 18:41:44 From a person that has seen what a dismemberment looks like and the gruesome way it was perpetrated. No amount of oil,money could appease me! I would lose my mind if it was my family member and to add insult to injury, shaking the hand of the man who ordered the murder! Hell no!
5696 2018-11-21 18:41:36 If they are anti Canadian oil what oil do they support? ...... SAUDI ARABIA?? Anti Canada = enemy of the people?
5697 2018-11-21 18:41:36 I need a job as an Executive Assistant or a Front Desk Officer because I have experience in both but in the mean time I am your go to plug for all your household/small kitchen items which can be used as souvenirs. I have ORGANIC oil based perfumes too
5698 2018-11-21 18:41:35 I think it’s time Britain did something about this relationship with the UAE are we that desperate for their oil that we don’t mind if they murder people or jail people unreasonably it’s a good question is there anyone in the government that would answer it

Oh yea they have been sending pool free to America. Are they the only country with oil ???.
5702 2018-11-21 18:41:29 playoffs 11 of 12 years and been a bottom feeder most of those missed years.

That's pretty much overwhelming evidence that the pessimists have been right all along.

Even in the one good year, the objective types were actually positive (because the underlying data indicated that
5703 2018-11-21 18:41:24 Gas prices aren't the same as oil prices.  No break on the west coast after a 30$ drop.  West coast just keeps getting taxed more.  Soon all Republicans will be gone from the US coaSt line.  Thanks for gutting salt and increasing tax on ALL HomEowNerS.  Thanks a lot.
5704 2018-11-21 18:41:24 Currently getting taken advantage of at the oil change place.
5705 2018-11-21 18:41:23 Are you really this stupid? It is mind-boggling. It only took me a minute to determine that we only get 11% of our oil from your pals the Saudis. CANADA is our biggest importer. #IdiotInChief
5706 2018-11-21 18:41:19 I'm not sure where you're from , but when oil goes to $60 or less a barrel, thousands of Americans lose their jobs. American companies cannot afford to drill for oil at that price. That's the real issue here. Just ask the people living & working in the Bakken.
5707 2018-11-21 18:41:16 Jonathan was pressured by Obama, Cameron and other international players to concede power to buhari because it will guaranty them easy access to oil and gas in Biafra.
5708 2018-11-21 18:41:14 Impose sanctions and drive oil to 150. Then we can drill baby drill

5711 2018-11-21 18:41:11 Oil prices rose almost $2 a barrel on Wednesday, bouncing from the  lowest levels in months, after U.S. government data showed strong  demand for refined fuel, but concerns remained over rising global  crude supply.
5712 2018-11-21 18:41:11 You put a dollar value on human lives & expect us to be happy about it? Despicable, sociopathic lies! We get more oil from Canada than SA & they need us, not the opposite! Quit thinking about your crooked deals with these dictatorships and JUST TRY to actually think of the US!

5715 2018-11-21 18:41:05 hey if the oil industry wants to subsidize the rest of the US economy, I'm all for it, God bless them
5716 2018-11-21 18:41:00 Really, are oil prices plunging? Not with the dread I have checking home heating oil today. Oil prices were 'great' during Obama's last months in office just before the Prince of Darkness was put in place. Such a fraud.
5717 2018-11-21 18:40:56 I guess you don’t know the difference between Brent and WTI. WTI hasn’t been that high since 2014, but I wouldn’t ever expect you to be knowledgeable or honest. I’m sure the North American oil and gas industry will love you. Like farmers they’ll say thnk u may I have another?
5718 2018-11-21 18:40:47 Nah it’s just American capitalism at work. Exxon says it figured out to churn oil at 15 per barrel while staying profitable.
5719 2018-11-21 18:40:44 I guess we can thank President Trump for his comments on the high price of oil a few weeks back, for getting us to this position. May these prices go even lower, as a cold dark winter beckons.
5720 2018-11-21 18:40:43 the Trump oil lie.   I....is that we're still dependent on their oil.  (We're not.)   II ...is that punishing them for Khashoggi murder would impact oil prices.   III ...is that prices are low because of Trump.  And IV ...is that we will let them stay low.

Crushe it in a bowl until it is sloppe.

5723 2018-11-21 18:40:32 I don't think so.

That 'lower oil prices' was just a bone thrown to his #MAGA #CULT so they can 'justify' the murder.

REALITY is >>>  HIS PERSONAL TIES to Saudi are what he focused on.

Jared & @IvankaTrump are deeply involved with #MbS
5724 2018-11-21 18:40:32 Wow. Reminds me of stories about how the entire Saudi petroleum infrastructure has basically bombs strapped to it. But that’s only a credible threat if they can affect world oil supplies/prices by going offline (and if they still have oil reserves to tap).
5725 2018-11-21 18:40:31 The crown worn by @rogerwaters in the photo below was a gift from the Wuaorani people of Ecuador. Cesar Nihua explained it is given to young warriors who protect Indigenous territory from invasions by oil companies. #RogerWatersVSChevron @KarenHinton @SLAPPtaskforce
5726 2018-11-21 18:40:27 I love the technique but no oil no rice can’t do in my country those are as essential as the rice per say xD but thank you lots
5727 2018-11-21 18:40:27 Someone should tell MAGA folks that lower oil price weakens US's oil fracking industry. That Trump is again lying.
5728 2018-11-21 18:40:26 Interesting. .
To get lower oil prices
All you had to do was condone the
 torture and murder of a human being. ..

Your presidential legacy is going to be Dark indeed. .
5729 2018-11-21 18:40:25 The thing is, it doesn't really matter... The U.S. is caught between a rock and hard place due to socio-economic geo-politics in the Middle East. "The enemy of my enemy is my friend," and all that rot. Yeah, it stinks; but there is no alternative to them right now. < Oil prices.
5730 2018-11-21 18:40:22 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
5731 2018-11-21 18:40:22 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
5732 2018-11-21 18:40:21 Sure!
Let’s trade innocent lives (Jamal Khashoggi) for cheaper oil! You have a great moral compass Trump. NOT
#sarcasm #trumpsucks
5733 2018-11-21 18:40:18 Donald has essentially sent the message to Saudi Arabia that they can get away with murder, literal murder, if they keep buying weapons and sending oil. That is a dangerous wager.
5734 2018-11-21 18:40:17 Right now oil companies are drilling 25K ft below the sea, using the same technology they used that failed, killed people and dumped 210 millionw gallons of oil into the sea.

Cue the "Do you drive a car?" comments....
5735 2018-11-21 18:40:16 While Trump tariffs Canadian steel and aluminum he tweets "Thank you!" to MBS & the Saudi butchers for cheap oil. Canada is the US's biggest oil supplier at 40% compared to only 11% from the butchers  @SaudiEmbassyUSA @realDonaldTrump @liberal_party @PCParty1867 @NDP
5736 2018-11-21 18:40:16 Yes, I agree with that.

That said, much of this discussion occurs NOT because of "being negative" at all.

It's actually because a (noisy) group of "I'll tell you how to fan" types cannot distinguish between objectivity and pessimism.

The reality is, this team has missed the
5737 2018-11-21 18:40:13 Low oil means high usd..  which means weak economy.   Doi
5738 2018-11-21 18:40:08 Oh boy, that's easy to answer, why? You didn't want to punished Saudi Arabia for murder. You need get lower oil price. Like kiss their ass! If you punished Saudi Arabia for murder. Then Saudi Arabia will not sell oil to you or increase expensive oil price! You see! You afraid!
5739 2018-11-21 18:40:07 U.S. gets barely 10% of its oil from Saudi Arabia, birthplace of the 9-11 catastrophe. We don't have the political & moral will, you say, to cut those f**kers off and make up the 10% elsewhere? We could do it if we tried. #AlsoElectricVehicles
5740 2018-11-21 18:40:06 #Trump Tweeted this at 2:30 am. Followed by a Thank You Tweet to the Saudi's for lowering oil prices? When will openly start questioning his mental health. I'm no shrink, but there's something seriously wrong here.
5741 2018-11-21 18:40:05 Trump doesn't mention that it was his friends Saudi Arabia and Russia conspiring together that drove oil prices so high.
5742 2018-11-21 18:40:05 サラダ油に流されて変わってゆく私をあなたは時々遠くで叱って。
5743 2018-11-21 18:40:03 Saudis lower oil prices as payment for a pass on a murder?
5744 2018-11-21 18:40:02 Oil is not well
5745 2018-11-21 18:39:58 His explanation was especially poorly worded, but Saudi Arabia has been a barbarian state that kills women accused of adultery and executes homosexuals forever, and every POTUS since FDR has looked the other way for oil and regional strategic reasons. @saudiarabia
5746 2018-11-21 18:39:55 jackie deangelis, did anyone else notice, everytime when was talking about $oil going lower, she sounded like she was masturbating(shes loving it)
5747 2018-11-21 18:39:55 1. You mean The United States. America(s) is from Alaska to the bottom of South America. 2. If you were "America First" you'd be using our oil reserves and not relying on a state murderer.
5748 2018-11-21 18:39:53 Newsflash: Obama isn’t president anymore. You people always deflect to the Clintons/Obama rather than focusing on Trump’s actions. It’s laughable.

FACT: Trump brokered a $350 billion weapons deal with KSA, is siding w/an assassin over the CIA & America bc of oil & his businesses
5749 2018-11-21 18:39:51 We only get 10% of our oil from them as well. It’s blood money through and through!
5750 2018-11-21 18:39:47 RT @CBCAlerts Donald Trump has just tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to 'a big Tax Cut for America and the World!' In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
5751 2018-11-21 18:39:46 Death of a journalist = cheap oil, shame on you!
5752 2018-11-21 18:39:45 "Oil is the opiate of the people."
5753 2018-11-21 18:39:44 You might add that because Saudi oil gets cheeper it cuts into the profets of their competitors.
5754 2018-11-21 18:39:43 Shorter Donald Trump to Saudis; Don’t concern yourselves with that murdering an American resident thing, he was just a journalist anyway. And by the way, thanks for the low oil prices.
5755 2018-11-21 18:39:42 Short OIL & get a shave.
5756 2018-11-21 18:39:41 I hate to bother you with CONSENSUS REALITY, but WE are the world's largest oil producer.  So your fellation of the Saudis is pointless.
5757 2018-11-21 18:39:35 Khashoggi - not worth an Oil War
5758 2018-11-21 18:39:31 You even made it to global news once on your way up to 10k followers. (Selling City of Calgary the old Oil rink haha)
5759 2018-11-21 18:39:29 Saudi's have nothing to do with low oil prices.   We make most of the oil.

5761 2018-11-21 18:39:25 Last time I’ve seen prices this low California gas prices were in the low two dollars below two dollars we’re still playing over $3.50 wrong we’re getting ripped off here in California by you oil tycoons
5762 2018-11-21 18:39:24 Oil is to important. We need to become energy independent. Once we are we withdraw and let them kill each other as is their nature/culture
5763 2018-11-21 18:39:23 Is like they poured hot oil on her 
From fried yam
5764 2018-11-21 18:39:23 @KaiNacua hey kiddo! I was listening to the BYU coach talk about Deep Blue essential oil today. Thought of you. Do you have experience with that oil that you’d share with me? Message me if you don’t mind! I’d love a video to post on my oil education page. Or a quote! 
5765 2018-11-21 18:39:23 quelqu'un sait si il y a du gas oil sur ruoms et vallon ? merci
5766 2018-11-21 18:39:21 @ $150 we will explore, pump & Buy lots of Canadian oil sand production. Hydrocarbon companies will be happy since they have optimized to be profitable at <$40/bbl. Inflation will rise in Trump country & Higher gas will tax Middle Class = 5-6% of persuadable trump base will go
5767 2018-11-21 18:39:18 I'm going to Washington for Thanksgiving and I smoked a quarter gram of oil and a whole joint before I left and I'm still not high enough for this
5768 2018-11-21 18:39:15 I wish they will call me Arab safe coz of the oil money..  

Mine is always Yellow or Dan fulani
5769 2018-11-21 18:39:14 Maybe he took  a play from the Art of the Deal.....silence for Khashoggi/support for MBS in exchange for lower oil pricing....
5770 2018-11-21 18:39:13 can’t tell you the last time i got oil in my car & i can so tell 
5771 2018-11-21 18:39:11 OPEC will play whatever games they can, but at the end of the day, they need the money. KSA has a welfare state to support and when people get upset thier, heads literally start to roll. Oil will keep making it to market rest assured while the US consumer benefits. @PowerLunch
5772 2018-11-21 18:39:04 Stop the feel good statements and realize what your dad did. He refused to accept the CIA findings and thanked MBS for lower oil prices. Scream in his ears that an American journalist was killed by MBS!  If you don't publicly condemn his inaction, you are just as guilty!
5773 2018-11-21 18:39:00 Trump said him and his dealings with the Saudis have kept the price of oil low for Americans - so we should be grateful and ignore a barbaric, government-sanctioned murder. 
Any economist will tell you exactly why the price of oil is low....and has been for a decade.

5775 2018-11-21 18:38:52 Most of our oil comes from Canada anyways...
5776 2018-11-21 18:38:46 Except 40% of our oil comes from Canada and 10% comes from Saudi Arabia. But Canada didn’t buy your condos.
5777 2018-11-21 18:38:46 But WAIT... drill baby drill and we did and we became the biggest oil producers, at least that's what we've been told. 
Oh wait, now we are the biggest exporter of crude. I guess signing onto drilling everywhere wasn't about American prices AT ALL it was about Big Oil $$
5778 2018-11-21 18:38:40 Possibly the support on murder case was conditional on reduction o oil prices?
5779 2018-11-21 18:38:33 Maybe Canadians could focus on selling oil for $14 and buying oil from the Saudi  tankers coming up the St. Lawrence to Quebec refineries and selling it for $60.The US is booming while Butts-Trudeaun ruin our economy.Are we stupid or what?
5780 2018-11-21 18:38:32 Try have some olive oil and honey with ur family and chill out 
5781 2018-11-21 18:38:32 1. Canada exports more oil to the U.S. than Saudi Arabia at a much lower price.  
2. The price of oil was basically the same on the day of your inauguration, maybe even slightly lower. 
3. U.S. does not necessarily need Saudi oil as desperately as we may think.

5785 2018-11-21 18:38:21 @exxonmobil @conocophillips @Chevron 

Who buys oil from Saudi Arabian murderers?  Please stop now
5786 2018-11-21 18:38:20 He should replace oil with steel and thank China.
5787 2018-11-21 18:38:20 Show proof, and by the way OPEC members are the ones who decide the oil prices, not Saudi Arabia alone. The Crown Prince, needs to be held accountable for his actions. No one is above the law, even one with a royal status.
5788 2018-11-21 18:38:13 Stop contributing to the nonsense that Trump just set for you to repeat, you fckn idiot. He’s fooling each and every one of you guys with this crap. Oil from Saudi = 11%, our oil from Canada 40%. Sick of weak ass guys on our side.
5789 2018-11-21 18:38:13 And that's with only one US citizen killed imagine if we gave them 10? Oil prices might go all the way back down to where they were in 1984
5790 2018-11-21 18:38:08 I never knew why the oil sands companies dont go on massive ad campaigns, promoting the oil sands as the world's largest recycling project.  They take oil soaked sand and essentially squeeze the oil out of it then refurbish the land. Instead,  they have yielded the high ground .
5791 2018-11-21 18:38:05 For as many that have walked in strife, and so bitter  - Father heal their hearts and give beauty for ashes, garden of praise in place of heaviness, and oil of joy in place of mourning. We decree and declare liberty to all. Amen!

5798 2018-11-21 18:37:34 We get 40% of our oil from Canada and 9% from Saudi Arabia. @realDonaldTrump treats Canada like a leper colony and Saudi like family. Don't tell me it's about oil prices you amber amoeba!!!!

5802 2018-11-21 18:37:29 I have been angry at US foreign policy in Gulf for a while. For all the money they have spent on wars and protection for oil, America could have been self sustaining via renewables.
5803 2018-11-21 18:37:29 Donald J. Trump

@realDonaldTrump
Oil prices getting lower. Great! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World. Enjoy! $54, was just $82. Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let’s go lower!
5804 2018-11-21 18:37:22 It’s this whole region, going down the drain not only Saudi. All of them, the end of the oil age is just around the corner thanks to Elon Musk
5805 2018-11-21 18:37:21 And Meathead,  unfortunately almost every current politician on both sides.  They just serve themselves and their corporate sponsors, all who hide in anonymity.   No one on either side is taking a stance against the Saudis until we no longer use oil.
5806 2018-11-21 18:37:20 also remember saudis r a borrowing nation they no longer have surplus.  we can nail them if we convert from oil to anything else
5807 2018-11-21 18:37:19 Captain Bridger and the crew of the SeaQuest answer a distress call from an offshore oil refinery and discover that some of the crew have been replaced by shape shifting coalescent life forms who are being exterminated by the oil drilling. Can Bridger broker a peace? #SeaQuest
5808 2018-11-21 18:37:19 Well, let’s just pick one part of Trump’s many misconceptions here.  It is NOT good news if oil prices drop too far.  It means a Recession is coming
5809 2018-11-21 18:37:16 There's nothing wrong with optimism, even in the face of mediocrity (or below). To me, being negative takes the joy out of a being a fan. that being said, I'll never rip someone for being a fan in whatever manner they choose, because how someone else fans won't change how I fan.
5810 2018-11-21 18:37:15 I gloat when they do smart things. Just so happens that it’s a rarity. Hard to look at the body of work the org has done the past 3 years and give my stamp of approval. I cheer on the players I wish they hadn’t acquired.
5811 2018-11-21 18:37:14 Put sand n the baby oil. As a precaution against such a claim
5812 2018-11-21 18:37:14 To change oil
5813 2018-11-21 18:37:13 What's the cost benefit of refining in Canada vs buying back our refined oil from the US?
5814 2018-11-21 18:37:09 Yup. Knowing where you don't belong is a good survival skill

Growing up fundie, I was taught that missionaries were awesome. Then we found out the group we supported were a front for oil exploration intelligence gathering. 
5815 2018-11-21 18:37:07 Bro. I definitely want people to be careful, but this is mad deceptive lol. Those turkeys are frozen and they are just dropping them in the oil.
5816 2018-11-21 18:37:06 @PowerLunch huh?  Can you use subtitles for @MorganStanley oil guy?  ...or tell him to use his lips.
5817 2018-11-21 18:37:02 Emerging Markets Get Boost From Falling Oil

One winner from oil’s steep fall: emerging markets that are major energy importers.
5818 2018-11-21 18:37:00 Never mind we'll get over it.

Now Tell us about Obama's secret plan to introduce Islam. Was he working with Indonesia and large Muslim states, or ME oil rich countries, or with terrorists?
Was the extent of  the plan and the ultimate goal?
5819 2018-11-21 18:36:58 Even when the largest foreign supplier of oil to the US is Canada?
5820 2018-11-21 18:36:57 You have also forgotten that Rotimi Amaechi was the main governor that stands against saving the money from the excess crude oil.
5821 2018-11-21 18:36:55 As oil is a top contributor to global warming, this is nothing to celebrate. Oh, sorry, I forgot - global warming is 'fake news, isn't it....
5822 2018-11-21 18:36:53 Good. We can't let the snake oil salesman keep the hate and divide heading  towards fascism and his president for life dreams.
5823 2018-11-21 18:36:52 We get MORE OIL from Canada than saudi
5824 2018-11-21 18:36:51 Yeah and us Canadians still get the shit end of the stick and still pay some of the highest prices for oil in North America. We could just stop selling it off to other countries and still self sustain.
5825 2018-11-21 18:36:45 No, he should sanction the Saudis. We have more than enough oil coming from Canada at a cheaper price.
5826 2018-11-21 18:36:44 Not to mention had nothing to do with the Saudis per se, but it IS the result of falling stock interest & markets for oil producers, thanks largely to @realdonaldtrump ignorant & ego fueled trade wars. In addition to being part of the normative price fluxuations for travel season
5827 2018-11-21 18:36:39 The best part of thanksgiving is watching the fire department instructional 'how to burn your house down by putting a frozen turkey in boiling oil' video.
5828 2018-11-21 18:36:36 Saudis murdered 3000 innocent souls on 9/11 on US soil.
Then with US supplied planes/guns & ammunitions, they murdered Yemenis & starved their children to death.
Then they murdered/chopped a @washingtonpost reporter.
Not a peep out of US gov.
We can get our oil somewhere else.
5829 2018-11-21 18:36:35 Literally blood for oil. Great job, ‘Murica! 
5830 2018-11-21 18:36:33 Since Canada supplies much, much more oil to US where is our thank you?
5831 2018-11-21 18:36:32 If we kept our own oil from fracking we wouldn't be so concerned with what SA does.  Good time to cleave from that relationship. #Khashoggi
5832 2018-11-21 18:36:26 Do we really need the Saudi oil? I have heard there is a life long supply of oil in southern Texas that would eliminate our need to ever depend on SA......
5833 2018-11-21 18:36:18 The tax cut  had nothing to do with oil prices-gas is still over $ when it was under $2 when you took over-time to appoint a special prosecutor for Ivanka and to fire Sarah Sanders for framing Acosta with a doctored video-Trump crash going on-the end is near! Thank God!
5834 2018-11-21 18:36:16 You do know where you get your largest amount of oil comes from, right? 
5835 2018-11-21 18:36:16 That bath really helped with my mood. I’m getting better at herbal and essential oil mixtures.
5836 2018-11-21 18:36:15 An enlightening facial mask, pastel cobalt blue, with bearberry, rosewood oil, and exfoliating crushed lemon seed. It's a a lemony-smelling liquid in a tube.
5837 2018-11-21 18:36:14 They had an advert banned from TV about palm oil and the affect on orangutans. It's had millions of views on social media.
5838 2018-11-21 18:36:05 Well it’s not thanks to Saudi. It’s because we are producing more oil and the Saudi is almost giving it away because the price has plummeted..........because.......we’re producing more of our own oil.
5839 2018-11-21 18:36:04 Yeah, cut off a man's head and limbs, we like it cause the prices of oil go down. Ted, when are you guys gonna cut this guy a new one?
5840 2018-11-21 18:36:03 Eff your oil prices & Saudi Arabia /mbf!  Let's hear self suffiency, renewables!
5841 2018-11-21 18:36:03 No, he is just saying what we have been doing all along - prioritizing military sales and oil over human rights.  Our moral compass has not changed one bit, it is just more honest and open now.  Sad to be a party to this as a thoughtful, compassionate American.
5842 2018-11-21 18:36:02 I hate getting my oil changed. $120?! This why I only go once a year.
5843 2018-11-21 18:36:01 Damn i just realized I spilled gas and oil on my yeezys when I was working on my car Monday lmao
5844 2018-11-21 18:35:57 The oil's not good until it's "refined"...something @realDonaldTrump will never be.
5845 2018-11-21 18:35:54 Thank you Mr. President. I heat by the oil it is expensive thank you for lowering the price I could care less about the Saudi journalist he not LowerMyBills. All the democratic socialist want to do is and raise the prices. Thank you again.
5846 2018-11-21 18:35:48 YALL I was out w/ my bro and his nose was stuffy and he couldn’t breath so I told him to take some of my chapstick and put it under his nose so that the peppermint oil would clear him up and HE PUSHED HIS FINGER INTO IT AND COMPLETELY MESSED UP THE SHAPE THAT I WORKED SO HARD ON
5847 2018-11-21 18:35:47 2/5 Survive in slow growth: Maintain/ expand sales in high growth markets in the rest of the Sub-Saharan Africa but monitor declining profitability. Be mindful of countries that are exposed to the low oil price, falling commodity prices & weakening macro-economics #Entrepreneur

5849 2018-11-21 18:35:46 13. I’m talking about the mother f----s poisoning the poor people’s water with fracking oil, I’m talking about slave labor and no health care. I’m talking about the entire financial system and everyone in it who’s robbing us blind. I’m talking about labor unions being destroyed.
5850 2018-11-21 18:35:46 Under Obama we reduced our dependence on foreign oil.
5851 2018-11-21 18:35:44 Over the last 5 years we receive a little less then 12% from the Saudis. (around 40% from Canada). This isn't about the oil (he doesn't care). It's about the Trump family bottom line.
5852 2018-11-21 18:35:41 There was. It wasn't uncommon knowledge about how many of the 9/11 participants were either Saudi or Saudi funded. But do you remember how much oil was back then? You don't care, we don't care as long as gas is cheap.
5853 2018-11-21 18:35:29 Oil $ lower b/c DJT didn't force large countries into the Iran sanctions as OPEC countries anticipated. Now there's an oil GLUT as they pumped their oil to capture Iran's expected lack. GOOD CHESS SIR!!! AMERICA WINS AGAIN!!!!
5854 2018-11-21 18:35:29 If your referring to that ranting girl, i feel ya. Use some oil based makeup remover and keep it movin
5855 2018-11-21 18:35:29 There is an oil market for trading (capitalism) - it is a free market and the President really shouldn't try an influence it - sometimes it is better to say nothing
5856 2018-11-21 18:35:26 I have 30% oil left in my car. I need to travel to Toronto Tuesday and come back home.. i should probably do an oil change to be safe?
5857 2018-11-21 18:35:16 No thank you. I need to keep my job in the oil and gas industry
5858 2018-11-21 18:35:13 Brennan well knows the US depends on Saudi oil & Saudis adherence for the dollar standard. 
Now why do you think he would want this declassified? Is it possible Brennan does not have the US's best interest in mind? Is it possible he is blinded by 
#TDS ?
 Or is he just a traitor?
5859 2018-11-21 18:35:11 When I worked in the oil field during the boom in 2014-2015 money was coming up out of the ground. Fracking was new and it took Saudi Arabia by suprise. The bust was brutal $150 dollar a barrel to $32. People with leverage got wrecked. But some survived and became better. $btc

5862 2018-11-21 18:35:02 Stock Market shrunk yesterday so....oh, yeah lets talk about oil prices finally reaching the level it was at when @BarackObama was President. #SaudiArabia murdered a journalist because they figured you wouldn't mind.
5863 2018-11-21 18:35:02 Drink every morning one spoon of olive oil  but extra virgin  not fake one 
5864 2018-11-21 18:35:01 Oil sand oil and expensive to refine.
5865 2018-11-21 18:34:59 I’d rather have higher oil prices than to let Saudi crown prince get away with murdering an innocent man. Who will he murder next?
5866 2018-11-21 18:34:58 Finally getting this oil change
5867 2018-11-21 18:34:58 Nobody can be this stupid and heartless, thanking a brutal dictatorship which just murdered a journalist, for lower oil prices. Trump is in bed with these Arabs. He needs them for money. Trump simply cannot sink any lower than this, but stay tuned.
5868 2018-11-21 18:34:44 This president of the United States is congratulating country who just killed an American journalist and Trump saying thank you!! for all obama was trying to make America not dependent on Saudi Arabia's oil. But Trump act's like he owe them Saudi Arabia.
5869 2018-11-21 18:34:43 This fucking spilled packet of skittles looking gringo really annoys me. I mean look at his teeth & face. He looks like oily water manifested onto a oil rig workers face and it scarred him forever. He looks like any type of brony at college. I can't wait for him to take a cock
5870 2018-11-21 18:34:41 Except when Americans are slaughtered by the folks with the oil, eh?
5871 2018-11-21 18:34:38 That's Energy East, no? Trans Mountain will go to US refineries. There are a couple small, outdated refineries in BC. Why has Alberta or Sask not build a refinery? Wouldn't this keep oil profits in Canada?
5872 2018-11-21 18:34:35 No. I don't agree.
5873 2018-11-21 18:34:35 America does not need Saudi oil but needs Saudi Arabia to stabilize oil prices
5874 2018-11-21 18:34:35 The fuck is that statement! Oil prices and contacts... What a misplaced and twisted accident of a president you poor people have. Corrupt.
5875 2018-11-21 18:34:34 You must not work in the oil industry like tens of thousands of Americans. Also, the vast majority of oil we import is from Canada.
5876 2018-11-21 18:34:32 A lampshade is also called a light shade and was used to first illuminate the streets of Paris, France during the 1700s and 1800s. In fact, the late 17th century use of the lampshade precedes the French "réverbères," which were oil lamps hung above populated streets that were...
5877 2018-11-21 18:34:30 Oil started at $53 under Dennison.  Along with Russia and the Saudis he got it up in the $80s.  Now he’s taking credit for getting it back to where it was.
5878 2018-11-21 18:34:29 Two little birds.  One baked and one fried (with no oil!) this year...
5879 2018-11-21 18:34:23 Totally agree. 

Most of the oil we import comes from Canada 40%. Only 10% comes from the Saudis.  Sad that we sold ourselves so low.
5880 2018-11-21 18:34:14 Missed my oil changed appointment, great start to the day
5881 2018-11-21 18:34:09 Does it really matter at this point what the price of Canadian oil is that is exported to the U.S.? You can be sure of one thing. Canadian oil is not mixed with blood and never will be. Is that price fair enough?
5882 2018-11-21 18:34:08 How stupid is your president? Lower oil prices are not good for your economy. Jesus, I feel for you guys - signed, worried in 
5883 2018-11-21 18:34:05 Great....dear Sauds...when oil passes 25 USD you Can kill another journalist - take two if picked from
CNN 
5884 2018-11-21 18:34:03 Spoiler Alert: that island has oil reserves.  WHO ORDERED A BOMBER FULL OF FREEDOM?
5885 2018-11-21 18:34:03 I'm just old enough to remember the oil crisis in the 70's from a child's POV. I think adults from that era still tend to see the world in those terms.
5886 2018-11-21 18:34:02 Give us free oil and you can slaughter anyone you want!  We’ll bring the weapons!
5887 2018-11-21 18:34:00 What actions? Do enlighten me. Because he did prefer trump, mainly bc of trump ending our convert annexation of Syria. Which you probably think is about humanitarian efforts rather then the oil pipeline planned to allow our ME allies to compete with Russia in Europe?
5888 2018-11-21 18:34:00 I'm going to recommend rolling yourself in fish oil on the special day. Just to up your chances.
5889 2018-11-21 18:33:59 @realDonaldTrump zero clue of supply  vs demand - there is currently an oil glut and looming recession. And @realDonaldTrump is just a #FckingMoron so we have that going for us
5890 2018-11-21 18:33:57 The red hat's don't understand we get 80% of our oil from Canada and the US who gives a shit with Saudis doing
5891 2018-11-21 18:33:56 Cinnamon oil, if spilled on Lego bricks, will melt the plastic. Permanently. Learned that one the hard way a long, long time ago.
5892 2018-11-21 18:33:55 God wants us to have cheep oil so shut up!
5893 2018-11-21 18:33:54 Blood oil
5894 2018-11-21 18:33:53 1 hour of work left until 4 days of whiskey and hash oil
5895 2018-11-21 18:33:51 More blood for the Oil God!!!
5896 2018-11-21 18:33:45 Thanks for “hacking” the price of oil.  See You Next Tuesday
5897 2018-11-21 18:33:45 Palm oil is not what you're thinking it is...
5898 2018-11-21 18:33:39 Ameachi was then the splinter group chairman of NGForum and had nothing to do with the Peter Obi group that was all about sharing the oil windfall.
5899 2018-11-21 18:33:36 So this is my favorite “oyoooolll” and she pulls out an olive oil bottle 
5900 2018-11-21 18:33:34 Eastern Canada by buying Saudi oil is helping fund these atrocities
5901 2018-11-21 18:33:26 Canada thank you since you proved 4x the volume of oil to us as Saudi Arabia and without killing or attacking American people
5902 2018-11-21 18:33:22 Bloody Oil
5903 2018-11-21 18:33:21 Animal agriculture is responsible for more habitat loss than palm oil. Bringing a life in to the world just to kill it seem pretty fucked up to me
5904 2018-11-21 18:33:20 we import oil at the world price wherever it comes from and the saudis are the swing producer and so set the world price. Even whenwe do not import any oil we will still pay the world price unless we put export tariffs onthe oil which is unlikely as it will depress US production
5905 2018-11-21 18:33:18 1 BBL in the ground outside of mideast, outside of north america, outside of latin america is worth $X today. When the $USD falls, those BBLs will cost more to extract, be more expensive to finance capital on. Makes Oil reserves in New Zealand more attractive the worse the USD is
5906 2018-11-21 18:33:18 Oil
5907 2018-11-21 18:33:08 No, that’s what coconut oil is for lol
5908 2018-11-21 18:33:06 India navy protects those islanders from Myanmar racist who wants to kill them like they did the rohingya and take the land, which has oil
5909 2018-11-21 18:33:06 Even shorter: we’re not ready to crash the global oil economy just yet.  That would give the cabal too much leverage.
5910 2018-11-21 18:33:04 You do know 40% of your oil comes from 
5911 2018-11-21 18:33:01 In Obama's last year the average price of a barrel of oil was $38.17. So your boast is premature, short of the mark and ignorant.
5912 2018-11-21 18:33:01 Garnier oil infused
5913 2018-11-21 18:32:59 Hate to tell ya but the US gets 40% of its imported oil from  (you're welcome) So the whole argument #45 makes is just stupid.
5914 2018-11-21 18:32:59 
5915 2018-11-21 18:32:52 There is no bottom to this soulless creature in the White House. #SaudiArabia literally cut up a man Tony Soprano style. And he thanks them for oil prices? #IHaveNoWords #impeach #SaudiArabiaFirst #TrumpTrain #UnfitToBePresident #UnfitForOffice
5916 2018-11-21 18:32:48 Anointing oil
5917 2018-11-21 18:32:48 Here’s a fun fact for all the #tRumpHumpers out there. US gets 40% of its oil imports from Canada, you know, the ppl to your north who #tRump constantly bashes. US gets 11% oil imports from SA. Canada not part of OPEC so we do not affect world oil prices. #tRump lied...AGAIN!
5918 2018-11-21 18:32:48 Oh no I understand what you meant, I was pointing out it's a straight money and oil thing and money talks even Trump understands that he may not like them, but he will sell them some stuff.
5919 2018-11-21 18:32:46 You get 11% of your oil from Saudi Arabia and murder is no big deal. You get 40% from Canada and the guy has a hissy fit over milk. 
5920 2018-11-21 18:32:46 We get only 11% of our oil from Saudi Arabia, you twit.
5921 2018-11-21 18:32:43 ...well, since the price of gas hadn't gone down, I assume this "tax cut" was ALSO meant to benefit ONLY the rich and oil companies...
5922 2018-11-21 18:32:43 Maybe we should start a campaign of fish canny pay for everything. A bit like they did for oil!
5923 2018-11-21 18:32:40 Residents are asked to curb wood heating. Why are industries like oil refineries & pulp mills allowed to continue spewing out toxins during #badair days? Is it because those refineries are located in poorer front-line communities, which sadly already have worse health outcomes?
5924 2018-11-21 18:32:38 First off Mr. Shatner, drop and roll. Preferably not on the overflowed oil (BTW - no water). Second, let someone else cook it. It's easier. Third, guys our age should not be eating fried food.  Kidding. Great warning video.
5925 2018-11-21 18:32:36 seems this rock has oil
New way of fracking 
I love it
5926 2018-11-21 18:32:32 ALSO i spilled this tea tree oil room spray on my hand and shes kinda burning ...
5927 2018-11-21 18:32:31 We understand oil prices were $53.00 a barrel on your inaugural day. You haven’t really done anything for energy prices. You sound like a true con man.
5928 2018-11-21 18:32:29 And way too much oil
5929 2018-11-21 18:32:25 ND oil employment already declined severely. The oil fields are run with half the people needed to get them setup. Oil production is down too.
5930 2018-11-21 18:32:23 #Ruble strengthens in volatile move thanks to major rebound in oil, the outlook for supply cuts starts to paint a picture
5931 2018-11-21 18:32:21 in reading the attached article find it is related to palm oil
5932 2018-11-21 18:32:19 Canadian oil is on the ropes.  TSX has been flat for years.  Strong economy?
5933 2018-11-21 18:32:19 Well, #Justin doesn't have to worry about seats in the large oil producing provinces, they won't have anything to do w him or his foolishness. Rightly so! However, it's too bad he's never had to worry about money in his privileged life, because he's going to have to worry soon!
5934 2018-11-21 18:32:17 Man I can't even make it that long, an hour in and I am drowning in cloth and oil and aluminum 

Springs on the other hand 
5935 2018-11-21 18:32:14 We produce more oil than Saudi Arabia. They are no longer,nor have they been for a long time the main pipeline for our oil. 
They need us for weapons to slaughter the innocent Yemeni ppl they aren't systematically starving by the millions.
We don't need them, that's our leverage
5936 2018-11-21 18:32:12 If you support the current government or the Oil and Gas industry the issue is the millions of dollars that are being lost daily to the USA when it could be going to Schools,Healthcare or Infrastructure for your great country and the citizens of Canada!
5937 2018-11-21 18:32:11 Yeah and you guys just feel free to murder, dismember and melt down anyone you wish. Cause it’s all about the oil prices.
5938 2018-11-21 18:32:11 Cos dey add oil
5939 2018-11-21 18:32:03 2/2 the term 'sustainable' has been commandeered by so many organisations to support their ethical position that it's become essentially meaningless.  Given the massive demand for palm oil from industrial manufacturers, how can it ever be 'sustainable' in real terms?
5940 2018-11-21 18:32:02 We produce more oil than Saudi Arabia
5941 2018-11-21 18:32:01 you can't soley place this crap on Trump although I would love to.. We the American people have found a greed for cheap oil where we have allowed killing of others to obtain it, stop saying this is something that has just started with Trump, he just is more open about it
5942 2018-11-21 18:31:59 You squeezed Saudi Arabia to lower oil prices In order for you to stand in their corner on the Khashoggi murder. You must think we are all blind.
5943 2018-11-21 18:31:59 In California, we are paying almost $4 a gallon. But I’d be good buying a bicycle if we didn’t buy Saudi oil...
5944 2018-11-21 18:31:54 Moronic , he has no idea Canada is the largest importer of foreign oil to the US .. but why let facts get in his way, he hasn’t before
5945 2018-11-21 18:31:45 How much oil does the US get from Canada and how much oil does the US get from Saudi Arabia? And Canada is the bad guy and our steel is the security threat? Really? What do the saudis have on you, tRump?
5946 2018-11-21 18:31:36 U.S. Rig Count is down 3 rigs from last week to 1,079, with #oil rigs down 3 to 885 and #gas rigs unchanged at 194 $OSX $OIH $USO #WTI #OOTT
5947 2018-11-21 18:31:33 The effects of seismic work are just being found out, yet were 25 yes or more into bigger oil and gas.
 If you ask me there shouldn't be any activity without proper environmental assessments.
Shut down areas for fishing, meanwhile 
o & g can has a free for all.
5948 2018-11-21 18:31:30 Saudi Arabia does not control oil prices. Shame for not standing against the Saudis regarding gross violations of human rights.
5949 2018-11-21 18:31:28 Be sure to give thanks tomorrow to Jamal Khashoggi and his selfless efforts to support lower oil prices. #BloodforOil
5950 2018-11-21 18:31:25 I guess murder of a US resident and member of the press is OK with you as long as we get money and oil. Not how I imagine as US president should act. Sad day for the USA.
5951 2018-11-21 18:31:23 Amazing how everyone is so light-hearted today at the NLHOA. Major Oil spill,  privacy breaches, unknown companies, yep, nothing serious. #nlpoli
5952 2018-11-21 18:31:18 Very little of our oil comes from Saudi Arabia or nations under OPEC pricing. Most of our oil comes from Canada & Mexico. Maybe you should try listening to those who know rather then talking (tweeting) and watching the fools at Fox.
5953 2018-11-21 18:31:18 I personally also mix in activated charcoal and fresh aloe Vera gel (sometimes tea tree or peppermint oil) but I know that’s extra af so honestly the original mix (with water & acv) works wonders. & I do once every 2wks cause that shit get messy. You can put it in your hair too
5954 2018-11-21 18:31:12 I need to change my oil and brake pads but lord knows I’m gonna procrastinate that til after thanksgiving 
5955 2018-11-21 18:31:12 How would you describe you love for Trump??? Backs dictators/not allies. Says the Saudis are lowering oil prices for us. They are lowering them to drive out US competition. Saudi have never been held account for much of anything because we have a base there/bribe every admin.
5956 2018-11-21 18:31:11 Out alliance with Saudi Arabia is about controlling the world oil supply and trade, anensuring pricing of oil in dollars. The Saudi company, Aramco, is OUR company: the Arabian-American Oil Company.

This, along with Texas and Pennsylvania, is the literal source of all our power.
5957 2018-11-21 18:31:08 Get your snake oil here! 

Don't be gullible, this is utter ripoff nonsense.
5958 2018-11-21 18:31:08 Oil has always been about blood money, it’s just never been shoved in our faces before without a lack of respect for life
5959 2018-11-21 18:31:04 #Canada is by far the leading export of oil to the US. @realDonaldTrump how many Canadians attacked the US on 9/11? How many #Canadians are involved in an immoral war? Cut ties with Saudi Arabia. We can make up their 9% oil export with higher imports from Mexico. Oh wait...
5960 2018-11-21 18:31:04 Also, it’s not true. Canada is the biggest supplier of oil to USA.
5961 2018-11-21 18:31:04 R U Trying 2 rub it in about the 'sheets & tablecloths'? Sittin' on Oil is all they got goin' I'd Still 'walk 3000 miles 2 smoke a camel!
5962 2018-11-21 18:31:03 Making sculpture from crude oil: why, even today, Bernd and Hilla Becher remain important
5963 2018-11-21 18:30:58 Donuts, but something about the oil they must use made them taste funny to me. And I don't hate on donuts ever, I was surprised.
5964 2018-11-21 18:30:55 How do you be a journalist? By researching before you tweet. Canada supplies more oil to US than Saudi. Your brown nosing is embarrassing.
5965 2018-11-21 18:30:55 They Might Just Want To Use It To Refill Their Break Oil Uno.
5966 2018-11-21 18:30:52 What? Like the fact that our president care less about America than he does authoritarian dictators? Or that an American citizen was assassinated and he doesn't want to risk the oil or business dealings with the Saudis? Or that he is doing whatever he wants against America? Cry
5967 2018-11-21 18:30:50 The Saudi's only supply the US with 9-11% of your oil.40-45% comes from Canada. When the Saudi's want to control the US they slow production, to screw with gas prices. Ya ,what a great ally. Good thing they own the president.
5968 2018-11-21 18:30:48 Lol nikuma Arab Arab Arab, the thing dey tired me
5969 2018-11-21 18:30:44 Why is oil half price of 2011 but yet the gas is still the same price... seems like someone is keeping us down.
5970 2018-11-21 18:30:39 Use Argan oil 
5971 2018-11-21 18:30:38 Just so you know we get more oil from Canada then we do from Saudi Arabia
5972 2018-11-21 18:30:32 Pass me the oil
5973 2018-11-21 18:30:32 This is without a doubt really awful ,talking about oil after you and Jared helped this MURDERER cover for his bloody crimes.
This is not over,it has barely just begun. Justice will be served.
Trust.
5974 2018-11-21 18:30:30 It’s still oil and still had a profound impact on global markets. Arguments over refining yields and resulting value of the products are interesting but probably close to immaterial to broader market dynamics.
5975 2018-11-21 18:30:28 I came to Walmart for an oil change and they're really tryna finesse me by selling me the same oil at a different price 
5976 2018-11-21 18:30:27 You couldn’t go lower than condoning murder for oil!

5978 2018-11-21 18:30:25 Every BBL sold increases demand for USD and demand for USD denominated debt. Saudi selling oil to China for Yuan is not using USD. This is reducing demand for USD by some #. When USD loses demand it will fall, and when it falls more $ required to buy BBLs
5979 2018-11-21 18:30:24 I don’t use a specific shampoo, but tea tree oil really helps. Also apple cider vinegar rinses with lavender and peppermint oil are amazing!
5980 2018-11-21 18:30:20 #Trump is lying anyway. We only get a small percentage of our oil from the Saudis. Trump is more concerned about his own future business dealings with them. Daddy's money getting low. #Grifter
5981 2018-11-21 18:30:20 This is a DISGUSTING tweet .... never mind the oil prices ....nothing gets lower than you Mr Me/Myself/and /I.
5982 2018-11-21 18:30:18 BTW why do we NEED to buy oil from ANYBODY?!?! The US is the top crude producer in the world!
5983 2018-11-21 18:30:16 I think Jim chanos had mentioned something about most oil companies in USA losing money in shale...the stock prices of the entire oil complex aren't really celebrating the increased production.

It's just good for the consumer.
5984 2018-11-21 18:30:12 At the very least...remember to take that bag full of junk in the cavity of your turkey!
Butter/ olive oil spray, season all, salt and pepper goes a long way.

5987 2018-11-21 18:30:04 Saudi Arabia  goes any lower and USA  oil will see a recession, that might be what breaks the market ..
5988 2018-11-21 18:30:03 Most of our current oil intake and consumption now is from domestic resources. Well below 1/2 of our oil comes from somewhere else. Trump is (again, as usuall) lying
5989 2018-11-21 18:29:59 Too bad we don't put oil in our cars, I noticed gas prices are remaining high. Hey and that 2 trillion pumped into the stock market has disappeared. Nice job numby nuts.
5990 2018-11-21 18:29:55 However, I couldn't fully agree. Yes, Gulf Arab States have something in common: oil wealth. However, the difference in social, cultural and political compositions as well as geographical location don't guarantee reinvention of Dubai model, and it shouldn't be.
5991 2018-11-21 18:29:54 Just learning right now that amsoil sells oil, not soil
5992 2018-11-21 18:29:50 @JohnCornyn you wanna talk to Trump about what lower oil prices mean for Texas?
5993 2018-11-21 18:29:40 Thanks for that, but I'm not an expert on palm oil production and I don't really have the time to read an 86 page report on it.  I'm sure you're well intentioned, but consumers just need a concise round up of what you are doing to prevent deforestation 1/2
5994 2018-11-21 18:29:39 Well today I bought a heater for the studio but not sure if it's gonna be man enough as its only a little 500w oil filled one from @Screwfix but we shall see. As I needed to do something as haven't been able to work in there as its been below 5°C. #cold #getoverit #heater
5995 2018-11-21 18:29:37 Saudi Arabia - thanks for oil CUTS and CUTTING in pieces of AMERICAN journalists.
5996 2018-11-21 18:29:32 Hahaaaa....mast hai Saif bhai.waise Bhai  they never buy oil , either they sponcered terrorism in country like Iraq after that they  attack in the name of fighting with terrorism and than after  you know everything.
5997 2018-11-21 18:29:31 Lol. Enjoy? Like you're out there negotiating oil prices. Is really enjoy cutting our reliance on an archaic fuel source.
5998 2018-11-21 18:29:26 @realDonaldTrump GREEN ENERGY!  FUCK OIL!
5999 2018-11-21 18:29:25 Better ban the Alberta oil sands,!!
6000 2018-11-21 18:29:25 Bla bla stand on principles on till death.... No no other ways to stand for principle without alienating your partner... whenever have Saudi Arabia been the perfect choice??? Never! But China need oil and a friend so thank you Mr Rubio.... NOT!!!
6001 2018-11-21 18:29:24 It's one thing following #Muhammad's ideology of hate and having oil, its another when your just from the mosque down the road - no wonder #Muslim's offended at everything.

All tbese rules and still me life sh1t3 ?
6002 2018-11-21 18:29:23 My understanding is that the Saudis, themselves, are looking to diversify from oil. That was part of MBS's plan with his NEOM project.
6003 2018-11-21 18:29:21 The irony is that apparently Canada supplies 40% of US’s imported oil as opposed to 11% from saudi arabia.
6004 2018-11-21 18:29:21 Why would trump thank Saudi Arabia for low gas prices, when they only provide us with around 11% of our oil? Canada provides around 40% - if we thank anyone, it should be them. Oh I know why: because he's profiting from SA. Bigly. #Resistance #MAGA
6005 2018-11-21 18:29:19 Did he say that Saudi Arabia was the US's biggest supplier of Oil ? NO! You are just reaching for shit now. His comment had nothing to do with canada. @Acosta @cnni @CNN @OANN #MAGA
6006 2018-11-21 18:29:19 I'd say micro-plastics are more of prob. Oil keeps most of the world alive. Alternatives will develop naturally. Tax will make already poor people burn other things for heat like plastic. Bin charges in Ireland led to illegal dumps, increased cost subsidizes cheaper dirtier ways.
6007 2018-11-21 18:29:12 He lied about where the US gets most of their oil from, we get most of our oil from Canada, not Saudi.
6008 2018-11-21 18:29:11 I remember Hannity saying lower oil prices was bad for the economy when Obama was president.
6009 2018-11-21 18:29:09 Just wondering, do you have an opinion on the use of CBD oil? It's been showing up in some states like, here in Texas, where they're dragging their feet on the use of medicinal marijuana.
6010 2018-11-21 18:29:08 The global economy has changed enormously since the 1980s, and the United States no longer relies on Saudi oil production to keep prices moderate; the American defense industry is not a major source of jobs, anyway.
6011 2018-11-21 18:29:05 The US imports four times as much oil from Canada as from Saudi Arabia
but the Canadian PM is insulted and the thuggish autocrat is praised.
Spanky's America
6012 2018-11-21 18:29:04 salutation à tous et toutes ,je recherche un poste dans le domaine de la construction en TCE -Mine-Énergie-oil&gaz-batiments -Tp-Voirie-VRD-Aep-Hydraulique- IT réseaux sec- construction générale,Merci pour toutes proposition a un poste.Bien à Vous
6013 2018-11-21 18:29:04 Yes, our interests. Referring to us seizing control of the supply of oil to Europe and Asia from Russia. Every conflict in the Middle East that we have been a part of has been a proxy war with Russia. 

And yeah, Obama was just as much of a war monger as the rest of them.
6014 2018-11-21 18:29:03 Low oil prices are NOT good for oilfield jobs. When the price of oil drops people get laid off.. I thought you cared about workers?? Oilfield workers cant handle more of this
6015 2018-11-21 18:29:02 And yet who feels the brunt of the boom and bust cycles of the oil industry the most? Right, the lower income citizens. A sales tax where there is none at all is a way for predictable government funding. How and what it's applied to may the the key to fairness here.
6016 2018-11-21 18:29:02  tho ai gaskiya ne oga
6017 2018-11-21 18:28:58 This is a great way to start your day. Just wondering general consensus in crypto about CBD oil- have you tried it?
6018 2018-11-21 18:28:55 body oil >>> perfume
6019 2018-11-21 18:28:53 Blood for oil....
6020 2018-11-21 18:28:53 Money and oil baby
6021 2018-11-21 18:28:53 There should be no free pass. But somehow the oil companies always get their mulligan. Look at BP and the Deepwater Horizon.
6022 2018-11-21 18:28:49 Soon the Arabs will shut down part of the production plants limit the oil and it will rise to New Higher Prices eventually! IT ALWAYS DOES: that has been the case sine 1976 when Carters recession hit us bad with high gas prices dictated by Opec in false cry,s of energy shortages!
6023 2018-11-21 18:28:49 Hey dumbass we get more oil from Canada than we do Saudi Arabia. The crown prince just ordered the slaughter of a journalist- where is presidential leadership! Where is the moral outrage? Oops forgot you are #UnfitToBePresident #NotMyPresident #ResignNow
6024 2018-11-21 18:28:49 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.
6025 2018-11-21 18:28:47 Maybe do some more research on gas pricing...Also the Saudis lowering price per barrel is bad for US oil companies. America First, right?
6026 2018-11-21 18:28:46 Don't we get most of our oil from Canada?
6027 2018-11-21 18:28:44 i would'nt try and do oil trading on twitter. it will probably spike from here anyway based on the high put/call ratios building.. #crude
6028 2018-11-21 18:28:44 On @FoxBusiness 2 pm with @cvpayne covering markets, trade, oil, Trump, ny giants  2 game winning streak. #FoxBusiness
6029 2018-11-21 18:28:39 You think the Saudis want low oil prices. More idiocy from @realDonaldTrump
6030 2018-11-21 18:28:37 It’s like he thinks lower oil prices are directly linked to gas station prices?
6031 2018-11-21 18:28:36 Now Potus says maybe they did it, maybe  not!!!Than he announced that oil is way lower, maybe they can go lower!!! It’s like a game he’s playing!
6032 2018-11-21 18:28:36 I thought we were energy independent not oil from Saudi Arabia.
6033 2018-11-21 18:28:34 It's one thing following #Muhammad's ideology of hate and having oil, its another when your just from the West Midlands - no wonder #Muslim's offended at everything.

All tbese rules and still me life sh1t3 ?
6034 2018-11-21 18:28:28 As much as I hate Saudi Arabia they are the largest oil exporter in the world, sanctioning them without an alternative would be a terrible idea. Russia is the 2nd largest exporter and Iran is the 6th. If we had a  rapprochement with them, we could get away from Saudi oil
6035 2018-11-21 18:28:28 The President's statement about Saudi Arabia is a stunning admission of something we already knew. The basis of our foreign policy is keeping oil prices low. Usually a President pretends that basic human rights and American ideals matter.
6036 2018-11-21 18:28:26 This is your President trying to make excuse for not doing anything to  Saudis for  killing an American. You are a liar because we get most of our oil from Canada not Saudi
6037 2018-11-21 18:28:26 I’m sure we have an increased supply now that China stopped buying oil from us. They were our number 1 customer before you.
6038 2018-11-21 18:28:25 Despite Trump’s BULLCRAP on how oil prices are so low, how come are gas prices SO HIGH 
6039 2018-11-21 18:28:24 And if they do it shouldn't make a difference since America is now the highest producer of oil but it will because the oil barons would rather put it out on the open market.
6040 2018-11-21 18:28:23 네 알겠습니다
6041 2018-11-21 18:28:19 Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia. Enough with your #FakeNews! You should know this information but you only spread lies that will make you look good. #SadPresident
6042 2018-11-21 18:28:11 I substituted honey for the little bit of sugar and in place of butter 
I used sesame oil.
6043 2018-11-21 18:28:11 Lol Hassan you're wicked
6044 2018-11-21 18:28:10 Do we know where the Saudi oil we purchase is processed? I’d like to avoid the stations that sell it. Boycott if possible!
6045 2018-11-21 18:28:08 Or maybe Saudi Arabia has changed its mind regarding the global oil glut now that there's an undersupply of strategic US national security policymaking and moral leadership but an oversupply of transactional, short sighted wheeling and dealing.
6046 2018-11-21 18:28:05 We're the world's #1 oil producer for years. Remember how the Republicans pilloried Obama for threatening domestic oil production with his green economy?  The ANWR deal and the Keystone fight? And now we're oil dependent on the place that produced the 9/11 terrorists? Bullshit.
6047 2018-11-21 18:28:04 Have you no moral compass? Drop in oil prices has nothing to do with Saudi Arabia. Plus the stock market is tanking.  So thanks for that!
6048 2018-11-21 18:28:01 And just wrong. 40% of US oil comes from Canada. Just 11% from Saudi Arabia.
6049 2018-11-21 18:27:58 The first sentence of Trump statement on Khashoggi is despicable. Blackening the murdered man's name, and dancing away.  Trump becomes accomplice after the fact. Today he shines like a child about oil prices.
6050 2018-11-21 18:27:54 I don’t fry our turkey because 

A. It’s gross. 

B. I’m clumsy and cannot be trusted around copious amounts of oil and a flame. 

C. Brining is better.
6051 2018-11-21 18:27:53 This country has turned a blind eye to the middle East oil problem bc we all profit from it with cheaper gas prices.. So, I'll ask you guys would you give up your blood oil cheaper prices to save people's lives? Doubtful just (being honest)
6052 2018-11-21 18:27:50 @AliVelshi Trump tweet on oil price wrong...Brent 82 now 64  WTI is 54!
6053 2018-11-21 18:27:46 Only in regards to money, so, mainly oil and the weapons. Human rights is a byproduct of our real interests there. If you need proof it’s not about human rights, examine our lack of involvement in countless areas across the globe where involvement isn’t as financially beneficial.
6054 2018-11-21 18:27:45 He thanked the Saudi’s for low oil prices this morning in a tweet... he’s definitely bought and paid for!
6055 2018-11-21 18:27:45 Saudi Arabia does not set oil prices you fool.
6056 2018-11-21 18:27:42 I've been suspicious of these fires for years. They start the ones in NorCal &, in order to use the "global warming" ruse, they start a couple of small ones in SoCal & blame the "Santa Ana winds" for all of it. Strange how Central CA never gets fires. All ag & oil here.
6057 2018-11-21 18:27:40 Trump thanks Saudi Arabia for plunging oil prices. Did they do that to thank Trump for insisting that Crown Prince not involved in death of Khashoggi or as a bribe to keep Trump from pushing the issue?
6058 2018-11-21 18:27:37 Yeah and the selling price of a crude barrel of oil in ND is dropping so quickly they're now expecting another round of deep layoffs as early as January 2019. Merry Christmas to you too, you wrinkled orange ornament.
6059 2018-11-21 18:27:30 The Trump Doctrine: Kill whoever you want, just keep oil prices low...
6060 2018-11-21 18:27:29 I have lived through low oil prices. Thousands of people lost their jobs. This @POTUS is so dumb that he doesn't even know basic economic facts.
6061 2018-11-21 18:27:29 Trump lies about positive effects of lower oil
Trump lied about better wages for workers
Trump lied about health care
Trump lied about Comey
Trump lied about Clinton
Trump lied every day this week
Trump lied about cost of troops at the border
Trump is not qualified to remain pres
6062 2018-11-21 18:27:23 Not to mention, he literally inferred that if you give him a 50% off sale on oil, you can kill whomever you want.  This is not OK.  Congress? Senate? Buehller? Anyone?
6063 2018-11-21 18:27:21 Also.  Lower Oil prices will not translate to lower gasoline prices.  You are misleading the American people.  Are refiners going to lower their prices  because their costs of buying crude are lower?  If your operating costs at Trump tower are lower do you lower your rent?
6064 2018-11-21 18:27:16 What a joke. The Saudi's are being hurt big time by the drop in oil prices And  45 Is thanking them to distract from reality.   As with the Russians the same goes with the Saudi's… Follow the money
6065 2018-11-21 18:27:16  DUDE !!! What the Saudies Do To Oil Prices is What the Fed Does To Keep Everybody Poor. NAILED !! Other People Can Co-sign it Especially Your Boy David Icke. It’s The Hole Reason Why They Follow (Some) Of the Laws. Money String Theory. Money Go’s Up, Fed Controls the Squeeze.
6066 2018-11-21 18:27:14 Mexico is NOT going to sell us their oil if we keep treating them like whale shit!
They are shifting their Agricultural buying away from us to Brazil and Argentina, where do you suppose they will sell their oil?
6067 2018-11-21 18:27:13 You will like him better now since oil prices are going down
6068 2018-11-21 18:27:13 Yeah, it's great, so long as you don't come from an oil-producing state, like Alaska. Every drop in oil prices cuts our state government's income dramatically. Thanks, Trump! Nice to know you're thinking of us....
6069 2018-11-21 18:27:12 I'd be willing to pay a few more cents at the pump if it meant gas were more scarce because we have put a focus on reducing oil dependency by creating clean alternative fuels/improving fuel economy. We could bankrupt the ME and end terrorism in the process if we wanted to!
6070 2018-11-21 18:27:11 .@AliVelshi Saudi Arabia & Russia cut oil production to raise prices & increase their income. Oil prices are lower cuz of increased US production. We owe Saudis nothing. Trump boasts $50 Million in condo sales to Saudis on the other hand while denying business with Saudis @MSNBC
6071 2018-11-21 18:27:11 Don’t you struggle with oil, too?  Or just nut oils?
6072 2018-11-21 18:27:07 Harvesting the olive groves to produce our exquisite and superior extra virgin olive oil. We love what we do.
6073 2018-11-21 18:27:04 Let them eat their sand, drink their oil and screw their camels. This is disgusting.
6074 2018-11-21 18:27:04 u put oil on the paint?

i love the aesthetic value that the combination creates
6075 2018-11-21 18:27:01 so oil > blood. good to know.
6076 2018-11-21 18:27:01 I always know it’s time for an oil change when my windshield fluid sign comes on
6077 2018-11-21 18:26:53 Khashogi's murder seems resulting in lowering of oil prices i.e. $60/barrel.
6078 2018-11-21 18:26:53 For the benefit of Saudis, @realDonaldTrump just gave a big F-U to US Oil companies and JOBS.   US Oil is deficit RED when prices fall below $65.
#TraitorTrump
6079 2018-11-21 18:26:47 Anyone that goes to jiffy lube I would seriously consider boycotting that establishment. They did an oil change on my vehicle and this is how they left  in the picture.
6080 2018-11-21 18:26:46 @HarfordSean Hi Sean my mail box is full of companies offering training re next September’s framework. (making good money no doubt), Is it possible that they have inside info? Or are they merely selling snake oil, based on fear of the unknown....
6081 2018-11-21 18:26:40 Your gas is only $2.60 a gallon? Where are you? I"m moving to where you live!!  (But, seriously, we get the majority of our oil from Canada, not SA)
6082 2018-11-21 18:26:36 @realDonaldTrump #Oil price was $40 a gallon in 2016 !!!
6083 2018-11-21 18:26:34 and when your fuel source runs dry, would you fill your lamp with whale oil?
6084 2018-11-21 18:26:34 I just tried to show my dad a meme about the military and oil and he turned it into a life lesson??? Just laugh sndnsmsmd
6085 2018-11-21 18:26:34 Head of a Woman
Priska Von Martins
Oil, graphite
6086 2018-11-21 18:26:34 we get get 40% of our oil from Canada and only 9% from Saudi Arabia.  So why isn't Trump kissing Trudeau's ass?
6087 2018-11-21 18:26:32 The Senate wants you to investigate the murder of Khashoggi and you are thanking the people who are responsible for his death just because the oil prices have come down? 

Believe me any lower than this isn't humanly possible! You dispickable, dispickable man.
6088 2018-11-21 18:26:29 Russia poisons their enemies. Saudi Arabia/MBS cuts them into pieces like a serial killer, and @realDonaldTrump is cool with that because we get 11% of our oil from the Saudi’s. Trump is vandalizing democracy and siding with killers! #Khashoggi #JusticeForJamal
6089 2018-11-21 18:26:28 I cut Oil prices just in time for thanksgiving! Now America can deep fry turkies for cheaper.!! Oil is grate! Make America, and oil, grate again!
6090 2018-11-21 18:26:25 @Fallout @bethesda WTF! 10 acid - 5 oil - 2 steel for 5 of fuel ammo??? are you kidding?
6091 2018-11-21 18:26:21 True. 
Again, given the draft restrictions set up by Hudson Bay, and especially Hudson Straight, one would be restricted to Tankers of about 50,000 tonnes.
Also, ROC would be up in arms shipping oil via Tanker through "environmentally sensitive" areas under their jurisdiction.
6092 2018-11-21 18:26:18 CBD Oil  Is Going To Be A Billion Dollar Industry by 2020
Who’s Interested In Selling it?  USA & Canada Only
Comment “info” Below and I will send you details.
6093 2018-11-21 18:26:18 If these were truly our abiding principles and values we wouldn't be having this discussion, but the fact is that we, as a nation, have been murdering brown skinned people by the hundreds of thousands for oil and profit for generations.
6094 2018-11-21 18:26:17 Saudi Arabia does not control the world's economy! Only a idiot of the likes of Trump would think it did! No one gives a shit what Saudi Arabia tribal chieftains do with their oil! One thing for sure, they can't eat it!
6095 2018-11-21 18:26:11 I hope for the best.   So far it's turned out like always.
6096 2018-11-21 18:26:09 His comments are wishful thinking because fuel prices in Australia continue to rise. Yes, oil prices are going down but I don’t believe him at all. He’s an asshole.
6097 2018-11-21 18:26:05 Low oil isn't doing shit for me and a guy was still brutally murdered by the Saudis and you're at their feet licking their feet. You make America so small in the eyes of the world
6098 2018-11-21 18:26:04 Leave the union keep the oil and guard it .no permission from Westminister your not slaves. Or as bad subjects.of Queenie . Scots independent. Have your country back.blood of Scots thanks to centuries if English invasion.
6099 2018-11-21 18:26:01 Remember when Germany was crying about USA protecting them from Russia while Germany was buying their oil. Germany now buys from us. You think Russia is happy?
6100 2018-11-21 18:26:01 @POTUS announces oil drops 25-30% and our gas in Florida drops 10-15 cents per gallon.  Domestic prices will only drop dramatically if we build new refineries.  Notice how much cheaper gas is in those states with refineries.
6101 2018-11-21 18:25:56 What an idiot, unleaded gas that is used in the United States is made from the Light Sweet Crude Oil that comes from NIGERIA not Saudi Arabia, Also lower crude could mean a slowing of the economy which would lead to bigger problems.
6102 2018-11-21 18:25:56 I need efficascent oil right nowww as in!!!! WHERE TO BUY?!?!? Jaldi jaldi
6103 2018-11-21 18:25:55 Saudis is responsible for 11% of our oil. Saudis just agreed with OPEC to reduce production and raise prices. Canada sends us 40% and you called them the enemy. You make us sick. #AmericanValuesFirst
6104 2018-11-21 18:25:54 US President Donald Trump thanked Saudi Arabia Wednesday for lower oil prices -- a day after pledging the US would remain a "steadfast partner" of the kingdom despite the murder of a dissident journalist.
6105 2018-11-21 18:25:47 I wonder how evergreen this @twitter adulation will be if Saudi Arabia goes ahead with convincing OPEC to cut oil production in December.
6106 2018-11-21 18:25:46 From the article. “The reasons for pressure on profits include rising wages, higher oil prices, a jump in interest rates (which increases financing costs), a stronger dollar and fallout from tariffs and trade tensions.” STRONGER $,HIGHER WAGES.
6107 2018-11-21 18:25:44 Thank you Saudia Arabia? What about thank you, Canada? They give us 40% of our oil. Saudi Arabia only makes up around 12%!  You are so transparent.
6108 2018-11-21 18:25:34 dotard, we want less oil.
6109 2018-11-21 18:25:31 TRUMP ALLOWS SAUDI ARABIA INVESTIGATE THEIR OWN CRIMES! THEN TRASHES OUR INTEL FINDINGS! THEN SAYS OIL IS LOWER BECAUSE OF IT!!!!!!! WHY PAY MORE IF YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH MURDER! TRUMP IS A MURDERER! HE IS A TRAITOR! HE IS A DISGUSTING EXAMPLE OF PUTRID HYPOCRISY! SHOULD I GO ON?
6110 2018-11-21 18:25:30 Yet 10% of our oil comes from Saudi Arabia.  Because our government is held hostage by special interests who prevent us from building pipelines.  And yes, many First Nations want the pipelines and the jobs they will create in their communities.
6111 2018-11-21 18:25:27 Don't ever fill up your car or buy ANY oil based product i.e. plastic, any rayon, nylon etc. etc. etc. It is made with oil. Suuuuuuu. #hypocrite
6112 2018-11-21 18:25:24 Yea, but some things are piss cheap, containers are one of those things. Same with grain and cooking oil. But in general yes
6113 2018-11-21 18:25:24 Tadinya pake tea tree oil tbs, skrg pake dermaluz, produk indo, baunya coklat enak bgt, dan lbh irit pake ini. Pake ini krn kena bisikan suhaylah~
6114 2018-11-21 18:25:22 With Canada supplying 40% of US oil how does a drop in the Saudi’s 11% supply benefit the US consumer. ? So you sold out the death of a journalist fo $48. What a negotiator! Once again the Saudis are laughing at the idiocy that is Drumpf!
6115 2018-11-21 18:25:20 The US gets most of its foreign oil from Canada. You must think people are stupid. And Saudi doesn’t control OPEC. It’s a conglomerate.
6116 2018-11-21 18:25:20 I’m really getting an oil change on lunch crying at that pig tweet  it’s even funnier bc I can’t laugh aloud w|o looking crazy a fuck
6117 2018-11-21 18:25:19 1/There are two major varieties of oil on the market, and YOU used a near-peak price of one to make the near-bottom price of the other seem more dramatic. West Texas Intermediate is indeed $54 but was only at $75 during its recent high in Oct and hasn't been at $82 since 2014.
6118 2018-11-21 18:25:18 This makes no sense Donald.  First of all your $82 is the Brent Oil Price and your $54 quote is WTI.  Furthermore, USA is now a net exporter of crude Oil, wouldn’t higher Oil prices benefit you?
6119 2018-11-21 18:25:17 You can kill a journalist as long as you give us low oil prices. That’s the message from POTUS. Disgraceful.
6120 2018-11-21 18:25:15 Time to go buy engine oil for generator service tomorrow.
Lord Jesus You know sha............
6121 2018-11-21 18:25:12 In 1941, Standard Oil Co. officials announce that the U.S. oil companies affected by expropriations in Mexico have rejected the recent US-Mexican oil pact.
6122 2018-11-21 18:25:10 Most of the oil use and convert to petrol comes from Canada, what a moron!
6123 2018-11-21 18:25:04 Maybe your mates should murder Hilary & Comey while you turn a blind eye and get oil reduced further. MAGA. Hitler would have been proud.
6124 2018-11-21 18:25:02 US buys 40% of oil from Canada. 11% from Saudi Arabia. Next.
6125 2018-11-21 18:25:00 Yeah man, the trouble shooting for oil painters is like a gift from heaven
6126 2018-11-21 18:24:59 Guys (men only) tweet your skin routine. What cleanser, serum, hydrating mask, face oil etc do you use?
6127 2018-11-21 18:24:56 One thing we can say about vile scumbag Donald Trump, he's the only President who has come out & said the truth about Saudi Arabia, "we don't care who they kill or murder, all that matters is oil & profits, baby" That's been US Policy for 60 years, at least
6128 2018-11-21 18:24:54 Right now it's trading at $24 per barrel. That's less than half of Saudi or OPEC. Of course that is never mentioned!

No need to buy oil from murderers... Mind you now Trump respects the Prince, he had a reporter killed and Trump has only dreamed of doing that.
6129 2018-11-21 18:24:54 Yo MBS, we'll trade you one American resident for $45 oil.  Feel free to torture and kill more if we can get that down to $40 a barrel.
6130 2018-11-21 18:24:49 Ummmmm......we only get 11% of our oil from Saudi Arabia. We get 40% from Canada. Why aren’t you thanking PM Trudeau for lower prices?
6131 2018-11-21 18:24:46 We have more gas than ever with fracking. They're just sticking it to us because of this administration's ties to big oil.
6132 2018-11-21 18:24:45 @realDonaldTrump Thank you Saudi Arabia for pumping more oil in the hope that everyone turns a blind eye to the Khashoggi murder. Clearly worked on this buffoon
6133 2018-11-21 18:24:41 trump tweet on oil price incorrect 82 Brent 54 WTI..brent now 64
6134 2018-11-21 18:24:41 I’ve only smelled them from oil makers, not sure if it’s an actual fragrance from a store. Prolly is but that shit smell like heaven, ain’t even gone lie to you
6135 2018-11-21 18:24:39 @realDonaldTrump has FLAT OUT let you know that oil prices are more important than morality and human life. #PonderThat
~X~
#Gold #Oil #Drugs
6136 2018-11-21 18:24:37 People thought Trump was gonna pivot

This guy just tweeted out give me 50% off oil and you can kill whoever you want.
6137 2018-11-21 18:24:33 Saudi men over paid psychopaths with hearts for cruelty, oppression, and tyranny. Who owe their broken psyches to patriarchy enshrined in extremism and their power to oil and a weak willed America. Can not be trusted.!!!
6138 2018-11-21 18:24:33 sorry, oil prices have nothing to do with Saudi.... franking, etc is
6139 2018-11-21 18:24:31 If Trump is America first, why is he not using American oil reserves to not rely on the Saudis and do what is right to not deal with a state murderer? He is not America first, he is ME first.  #Emolumentsviolation #trumpisafraud
6140 2018-11-21 18:24:30 $$$ is all Trump cares about.  A shallow oil slick.
6141 2018-11-21 18:24:29 Trump/GOPTPers don't apparently know that the US doesn't need 1 ounce of Saudi/Middle East oil.
6142 2018-11-21 18:24:28 Let's just side with the murdering royals because oil prices and $100 Billion weapons deal...

All you need to influence Trump is money, that's all he cares about.
6143 2018-11-21 18:24:22 Reason, it's easy answer, because he don't want to punished Saudi Arabia for murder, then can get lower oil prices. If he punished, then will not sell or increase price oil to Trump. That why Trump afraid!
6144 2018-11-21 18:24:21 But that's because it's true. Many women I meat arent very strong. Men have a lot of muscles compared to women and one good way to give an example is oil rig employees. All men. All muscle.
6145 2018-11-21 18:24:21 Actually gas prices are pretty high already so I am wondering where are these big oil deals for consumers? trump probably wrote a deal for trump organization and his crime family and forget the rest of us.
6146 2018-11-21 18:24:19 So, #SaudiArabia the president will let you murder anyone #TraitorInChief doesn’t like, as long as you lower oil prices or buy a condo from him.  He has no morals or values, so cash will get him to do anything.  #25thAmendmentNow
6147 2018-11-21 18:24:17 Let's talk about Peak Oil, Crop Circles, and Cholesterol first. Much more interesting. 
6148 2018-11-21 18:24:16 I am sick reading @realDonaldTrump 's tweet.  Something keeps going lower, and it isn't oil prices.  Shame on the republican's who do nothing.  @RandPaul @MittRomney @marcorubio @tedcruz  I beg you, make republican's great again.
6149 2018-11-21 18:24:15 Biggest takeaway so far: If Mobil 1 is really guaranteeing oil changes every 20K miles, I’m in.
6150 2018-11-21 18:24:11 I don’t need a man for anything. Except to tell me when to get an oil change.
6151 2018-11-21 18:24:11 you ain't gona do shit bc oil, oill, oill ,oill, oilll, oilll, makes the world go around.
6152 2018-11-21 18:24:10 Ever notice that countries with oil as one of their main resources tend to be illiberal, not all but most it seems. I wonder if that’s simply a coincidence or if there’s some sort of causal factor there
6153 2018-11-21 18:23:57 @justintrudeau @bill_morneau @liberal_party #climatebreakdown

We all knew the crash in oil prices was coming except you apparently.  You bought us a leaky, 65-year-old pipeline for $4.5 billion.  Sold it yet?
6154 2018-11-21 18:23:57 You are so corrupt thanking the saudis for lowering oil prices. You have placed human rights value and common decency over the dollar.
6155 2018-11-21 18:23:56 So basically it shouldn't be tried because the oil companies would shut it down?
.... Like they've been doing so they can stay in business?
It works in other countries in a free market. Let the market be free of influence of the oil companies and see what happens.
6156 2018-11-21 18:23:47 Is blood oil always..
6157 2018-11-21 18:23:45 fuck fossil fuels and fuck oil companies that keep peddling them to consumers instead of investing in renewable energy
6158 2018-11-21 18:23:45 This was known about a month ago that oil prices would decline around Thanksgiving...just like the buffoon you are trying to take credit for something you didn’t have anything to do with.
6159 2018-11-21 18:23:39 Pull the other one.

You won't do a single thing while we're selling them weapons and they're selling us oil.

Matthew Hedges will probably be left to rot in prison because it might upset our business partners if we speak out against what they've done.
6160 2018-11-21 18:23:36 starbucks gingerbread latte smells too good for something that tastes like chemical waste and essential oil
6161 2018-11-21 18:23:36 ได้กลิ่นแบบhair oilโสมตลอดเวลา กุไม่ได้ใช้แล้วววว
6162 2018-11-21 18:23:36 Trump has the leverage he needs to ensure cheap oil until 2020 at least. He can’t afford for the economic bubble to burst before the 2020 election.
6163 2018-11-21 18:23:36 Thank you to Canada where we receive 40% of our oil. A small percentage comes from Saudi Arabia. Thank you to Canada for your leadership towards human rights.@JustinTrudeau
6164 2018-11-21 18:23:35 Seeing as 40% of your imported oil comes from Canada and 11% from Saudi Arabia, you shouldn’t have to worry about that. We are also nice A.F.
6165 2018-11-21 18:23:32 USA gets 40% of oil from Canada and only a mere  11% from Saudi Arabia. Thank Canada instead!
6166 2018-11-21 18:23:30 Trump just gave a whole new meaning to Blood for Oil
6167 2018-11-21 18:23:26 Tumeric and coconut oil is what I live by
6168 2018-11-21 18:23:22 if you get caught with cana oil you can get a year cause it’s not the same laws as carrying flower oh my god
6169 2018-11-21 18:23:17 And 40% of our oil comes from Canada  .
6170 2018-11-21 18:23:15 ai ai ai oil pastel ain't good
6171 2018-11-21 18:23:13 Only 11% of our oil comes from Saudi Arabia. Stop trying to defend murderers.
6172 2018-11-21 18:23:12 "Let us keep murdering people in yemen and we'll lower the fuckin oil price"
6173 2018-11-21 18:23:11 Well I think we should find out if Saudi Arabia is the head of the gas pricing if they are we should put pressure on Canada to lower their oil prices also.theres a lot of things we don’t know about and that’s the way they like it.Our own government try’s to keep us in the dark.
6174 2018-11-21 18:23:10 @LBC #Brexit the #Opera produced by the tories and starring the #DUP and @Nigel_Farage has the snake oil salesman...
6175 2018-11-21 18:23:10 Really ? So Potus would sell his soul and the souls of the Great American people for oil ? Calls himself a man of god ! Need to realise some things can’t be sold!!
6176 2018-11-21 18:23:08 So it is acceptable to kill & dismember a US member of the press as long as you keep oil prices low?
6177 2018-11-21 18:23:07 @KingSalman Thank you very much for lowering the oilproduction, I hope the oil will grow back and I am utmost thankful for the high prices. It will create sustainability and a healthier atmos
6178 2018-11-21 18:23:06 So we should condemn Saudi Arabia and sanction them to death and destabilize the Middle East even more than it is and have oil prices skyrocketing leading to much more expensive gasoline here? We should also cancel the arms deal with them so China and Russia can step in?
6179 2018-11-21 18:22:59 Micheal asking if independent experts in oil investigation. Coady says what ever expertise they require. Says keeping an eye on CNLOPB
6180 2018-11-21 18:22:52 $TSX.CA is telling us to expect some good news from #BillMorneau today-#Federalgovernment #budgetupdate #BOC #Poloz #Trudeau #markets #stockmarkets #oil
6181 2018-11-21 18:22:51 I mean we are already paying more for anything with steel and aluminum, and no one is buying our soybeans. And lower oil prices hurt the 1000s employed in domestic oil production as well so...
6182 2018-11-21 18:22:51 Does this dude understand that many economies depend on oil prices being high!? @Sleepy_Sapphire
6183 2018-11-21 18:22:48 Today arrived sooner than expected but it’s officially my last day working with Sunoco. I have learned a lot working here these past 2+ years in the oil and gas industry and became friends with some of the best coworkers!
6184 2018-11-21 18:22:48 Cheap oil, hookers and guns trading, also they (Saudis) are good at assassinating unwanted people and planning and executing terroristic attacks.

#TrumpRussia  #SaudiArabia
6185 2018-11-21 18:22:47 The USA exports more oil and gas than Saudi Arabia. This 'few cents at the pump' line is bs...yes, the producers will raise price, because, what are you going to do, walk?
6186 2018-11-21 18:22:42 Tea tree oil nashefly weshy be tare2a bashe3a
6187 2018-11-21 18:22:38 I think that's unsurprising, because being objective about a team as bad as the Oilers means you spent a lot of time on the negatives.

That said, *I* think you're too positive!

I bet if you look at your track record, most of your "busts" will have been due to over-optimism.
6188 2018-11-21 18:22:37 If oil prices get too low lots of people would be out of work. Crime would go up. $70/bbl is enough to where we all can eat and live
6189 2018-11-21 18:22:31 Nothing to do with Saudi Arabia, but ok. Anyway, they are preparing to cut oil production soon to drive up prices
6190 2018-11-21 18:22:29 Nothing is as efficient or destructive and detrimental to us, than continuing to burn fossil fuels.
 Alternatives to oil must be used and we need to transition now. #taxoil out of use! 
The kids are only  depending on us l - #KeepItInTheGround #ClimateBreakdown #climateaction
6191 2018-11-21 18:22:28 "Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity, therefore GOD, even thy GOD, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows" (Hebrews 1:9).
6192 2018-11-21 18:22:25 Norway is doing better because it is an independent country, in total control of its oil revenues!
You can't compare it to Scotland, unless geographically speaking.
6193 2018-11-21 18:22:22 Not to mention, other states like Oklahoma, New Mexico, Wyoming, North Dakota, Louisiana, Mississippi and others are dependent on this industry, best part of these states voted for you. Including myself and millions of other Oil & Gas workers
6194 2018-11-21 18:22:14 Hey trump we only get 11% of our oil from the Saudis!!!  How much money do you owe them?????  We get 40% of our oil from Canada and you are not respectful of them?  Are the American people smarter than you....yep!
6195 2018-11-21 18:22:13 にゃんも起きてました！笑笑！！みんな早く寝ましょう！！(⌒▽⌒)
6196 2018-11-21 18:22:08 i was suppose to go get a oil change this morning 
6197 2018-11-21 18:22:05 *After too much Red Holi*
Now its showing Green Signals 

Dow +195 
Nasdaq +97 
HangSeng +230 

Brent OIL 64.07 (+2.46%) 

USD 71.086 (-0.48%) 

Seems all sentiments Positive side at current levels.
6198 2018-11-21 18:22:01 Projecting much? The Saudis are too afraid to raise prices on oil. Why? It helps push the world away from fossil fuels. The only concern here is, the Saudis keeping buying American made bombs to continue committing war crimes in Yemen.
6199 2018-11-21 18:22:00 Oil prices go down after trump defends Saudi princes murder allegations (that C I A believes he did)
6200 2018-11-21 18:21:59 Exciting times ahead JP, but can you see this immense oil find flowing
under the UKOG flag by 2020? The potential SP makes me shudder :-)
6201 2018-11-21 18:21:58 You are Sick. Do you think low oil prices could make up for the brutal killing of a journalist and convince us it’s a TAX break for those of us #NOTinthe1%.
6202 2018-11-21 18:21:54 Now that you have done the standard leftist media Trump bashing how about some real journalism explaining oil industry policies that have Alberta’s oil prices so low it’s not worth pumping it out of the ground.
6203 2018-11-21 18:21:53 just think of it as extra oil/fat to help keep it soft and manageable.
6204 2018-11-21 18:21:52 Nope, no more context is needed. Spend more time being fair and balanced and objective. Why don’t you interview Dr. Bhatt? I’m sure he’d be happy to do it, except he’s already refuted your mineral oil theory so many times. Let’s put Dr. Bhatt up against your article docs $AMRN
6205 2018-11-21 18:21:51 This was flat-out murder in the 1st degree, forget the oil from the Saudis and go green, then we can slow down and see how to fix the things that are broken in the USA.
6206 2018-11-21 18:21:49 Did ya ever notice that Man Made Climate Change believers use a LOT of oil and put a lot of Green House gasses into the air?  I don't think any of them use solar-powered electric cars and they use plastic coated paper more than anyone else for flyers, posters, signs then trash it
6207 2018-11-21 18:21:45 Low oil price at what cost to the USA? Trump’s administration will end badly, worse than Bush 43. GOP headed to a disaster
6208 2018-11-21 18:21:45 Amazing you would thank the barbaric Saudi Arabia, when Canada is our largest supplier of oil.
6209 2018-11-21 18:21:38 Tea tree oil is the best thing ever
6210 2018-11-21 18:21:37 Oil fixes murder. Got it.
6211 2018-11-21 18:21:36 They are laughing all the way to the bank. Bet every one of these anti oil people end up as millionaires in a few years. No one will ask for a forensic audit to see how they got the money.
6212 2018-11-21 18:21:33 oof i’m burnt as FUCK and i’m wearing oil and no sun screen, why am i like this
6213 2018-11-21 18:21:33 Wax or the oil like in the pens?
6214 2018-11-21 18:21:31 do you think the sizzling made by food when it touches oil is them screaming for help
6215 2018-11-21 18:21:26 We only get 9% of the oil we import from Saudi Arabia. The ignoramus in the White House does not know that!  #StableGenius
6216 2018-11-21 18:21:22 That must coincide with when the oil runs out... 
6217 2018-11-21 18:21:22 @JustinTrudeau @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Canada should stop selling oil to the United States, for the US President supports Murders, the Prince of Saudi Arabia. When are we collectively going to draw the line. #Understanding
6218 2018-11-21 18:21:16 US has so much oil yet they still terrorize the the middle east for oil
6219 2018-11-21 18:21:11 Not only Trump should thank Canada...40% of imported oil comes from Canada, only 11% of foreign oil comes from Saudi Arabia, Canadian oil is cheaper than Saudi oil. #BuyCanadianOil
6220 2018-11-21 18:21:06 US in energy independent. Now there is a glut of oil,price low so N Dakota oil fields can't compete. There will be layoffs. Housing starts down-layoffs. It's gonna blow anyway. Tax breaks didn't result in investments,they resulted in stock buy backs & damage now showing up
6221 2018-11-21 18:21:03 I twist downy oil fitted into ashes of pigeon.
6222 2018-11-21 18:21:02 Have you tried a steam inhaler ? Might help ? My daughter has asthma, and steam could help sometimes. Olbas oil ?

6225 2018-11-21 18:21:02 How come suddenly everyone is selling perfumes? And what's with this perfume oil business? Are they mixing perfumes with oil or what?
6226 2018-11-21 18:21:00 This is why I don't like oil they cooking Chicken so I get closer to smell the food then it explodes on the left side of the face but it will heal fast now going to DRC I see u at war my brother but I need my soldiers to focus we need to fix home the time has come
6227 2018-11-21 18:20:54 NEWS FLASH: We don't need their oil.  We don't need them to decide prices. Your addiction to money is killing us all.
6228 2018-11-21 18:20:54 "What difference at this point does it make"?? I'd love to show her the difference. Would laying hands on her and anointing her with oil remove the rabid spirits? Asking for a friend. She reminds me of a true life monster with big teeth and a fiery tongue. And horns. Pure evil
6229 2018-11-21 18:20:53 おやすみなさい!！
6230 2018-11-21 18:20:50 It’s killing OUR oil industry
6231 2018-11-21 18:20:49 @realDonaldTrump. ...you should be thanking #Iran ...

You negotiated a lousy deal that let's them pump as much oil as they want! ...
You are weakening #America!
6232 2018-11-21 18:20:48 Saudi is helping US bottom oil prices so as to punish Russia for helping Iran.  That's why they will always be pals.  Sewer rats tend to stick together in the dark.
6233 2018-11-21 18:20:47 extraordinary returns on petroleum resources, the oil companies are subject to an additional special tax The current ordinary company tax rate is 23 %, and the special tax rate is 55 %. In 2018, Norway's tax revenues from petroleum activities is estimated to about NOK 156 billion
6234 2018-11-21 18:20:46 Good!  We can't get in the middle of this. Oil prices are manageable and that positively impacts the lives of every day Americans.
6235 2018-11-21 18:20:40 Had it not been Oil Money FC very few would have challenged Barcelona 's case on signing this.Both Manchester City and PSG are disgrace for football.

6237 2018-11-21 18:20:39 You are so right. I understand Trumps position on Saudi Arabia, it’s the only position he could come too. We must not sell our nation soul for oil, no friendship is worth that. We R Americans we live and die on our feet, not kneeling at the feet of some  Prince.
6238 2018-11-21 18:20:38 mad as a box of frogs - must be that oil of ulay andy - 52? you're looking good on it!
6239 2018-11-21 18:20:37 They bent Trump and Pompeo over an oil rig and had their way with them.
6240 2018-11-21 18:20:36 @realDonaldTrump The Saudi got some bad hombres! A very good relationship! Maybe he did maybe he didn’t. Thanks for keeping oil prices down. “Please pass the salt”
6241 2018-11-21 18:20:35 Anybody wanna pay for this oil change 
6242 2018-11-21 18:20:34 Joe unfortunately this about oil prices and making sure they don't sell to terrorist supporting countries. It's a case of the need of many out weighing needs of the few.
6243 2018-11-21 18:20:31 Khashoggi was never murdered, knew too much about Bush and 9/11...and Trumps today  "America First" has same gematria number as Jamal Khashoggi, Michael Flynn and he thanked SA and reported lower oil price #payment ..SA ordered 10 million barrels of oil
6244 2018-11-21 18:20:24 when my father first gave me this oil i thought it was mild & weak and that he & my mother always got the best ones but lawwwddt
6245 2018-11-21 18:20:23 Tons of Advil, Cbd oil, eye glasses
6246 2018-11-21 18:20:18 We Alaskans are powered by coal (among some lesser other things) and oil. We have no resources or infrastructure currently to facilitate a energy sector change. We could lead the market if we planned better, but we're also super corrupt
6247 2018-11-21 18:20:17 Gotta take my daily fish oil capsule like those fitness thots ju heard
6248 2018-11-21 18:20:06 USA gets 40% of imported oil from Canada & 11% from Saudi Arabia. Get your facts straight @MegatronMighty.
6249 2018-11-21 18:20:02 Oil prices low because you get to cover for a murder all to own the libs.
6250 2018-11-21 18:20:01 Saudi Prince : Kill a journalist POTUS I don’t know nothing. Maybe he didn’t do it. Saudi Prince: we’ll lower the price of oil since you’re such a good boy
6251 2018-11-21 18:20:00 Oil barrels at ~$50 doesn't sound like getting stabbed in the back... I guess you were fine with gas at $5/gallon during Obama's admin?  Trump has increased u.s. oil production to highest levels ever!
6252 2018-11-21 18:19:54 Celebrities bhi baal mein oil lagate hain
6253 2018-11-21 18:19:50 Yes, and then the world comes to US for their oil. #brilliant #winning #theArtofWar
6254 2018-11-21 18:19:47 To bad she is owned by wall st big oil big pharma and the health insurance industry.  She fights her base and has more in common with the GOP.
6255 2018-11-21 18:19:47 I know lower oil prices are good for the country.  But what about the oil field working families?  How are these lower prices going to affect our lives.  We usually work a lot when prices are high.  Will that stop or slow? Is there something new coming down the pipeline?
6256 2018-11-21 18:19:43 My gran started taking cbd oil and bought a pair of snake skin pants,,, she’s why I’m like this, my family are all Like That
6257 2018-11-21 18:19:43 Oil companies played themselves
6258 2018-11-21 18:19:42 As long as the price of oil goes down, @realDonaldTrump is just fine with this.
6259 2018-11-21 18:19:41 Hollywood stars are big on Climate Change, yet their industry is the most wasteful on the planet.  They destroy things like cars and trash stuff simply for entertainment.  Not to mention the electricity and oil they use to produce and distribute that entertainment.
6260 2018-11-21 18:19:39 You slice cucumbers and onions.  Mix it with vinegar and oil.  My grandma always made a small bowl every holiday dinner.  I don't think it's considered a salad.
6261 2018-11-21 18:19:36 Dear Mr. Khashoggi, 
Thank you so much for giving your life to the USA so that we citizens may enjoy lower oil prices. Your sacrifice, and that of your family, on our behalf is and will always be greatly appreciated. We are eternally indebted to you. 
Sincerely,
A grateful nation
6262 2018-11-21 18:19:31 #India is under debt burden interest pay on state/national debt repayment is drain of economic resources causing inflation & money loses its value due to devaluation of ₹ is leading steep price rise due to costlier crude oil imports.Ban Gold import&clear debts by gold resources?
6263 2018-11-21 18:19:31 And just FYI, oil prices tend to be a leading economic indicator. If prices are down it’s due to either over supply or lack of demand. I know, these are hard concepts to understand for brain that doesn’t function normally.
6264 2018-11-21 18:19:30 Donald Trump is corrupt. He letting the Saudi King away with murder so he can help him keep oil prices down.

6268 2018-11-21 18:19:19 Will #palmoil standards body @RSPOtweets ever champion real sustainability? This week its members vote on whether to clamp down on labour abusers like @Indofood who go on selling palm oil marked with its logo #RT16 #RSPO

Think then they would come up in #ValueToTrumpInternational in DJT's eyes?
Even though we get 40% of our imported oil from them....minor detail there.
6274 2018-11-21 18:19:03 [pouring olive oil into the pan]
6275 2018-11-21 18:19:02 Tax cut? What on earth are you talking about? I'm not sure those of us involved in the Oil & Gas industry are too pleased with $54 a barrel.
6276 2018-11-21 18:19:02 In all seriousness, EDM has had more than their share of opportunities to find success. Shut up and fix it. “If we could just get..” no, your talent development is garbage. Fix it or rebuild it. EDM has become laughable at this point.
6277 2018-11-21 18:19:00 Methinks bribed, if oil prices just dropped $30 a barrel, give or take.  They’re trying to bribe all of us.
6278 2018-11-21 18:18:59 You just have to understand #liberal speak. Liberals see "in the shitter" as a better place for the oil industry. He said he wants to phase out the tar sands, so to see them struggling and suffering is a "better place" to #Trudeau
6279 2018-11-21 18:18:58 #ThanksgivingEve Be especially thankful you got your retirement portfolio out of this market and can observe from a safe distance what happens to those who didn't heed the warnings of the last year and one-half. Plummeting oil prices present a rare opportunity to buy Exxon cheap
6280 2018-11-21 18:18:57 So how much is the life of one person worth?  The President has decided that a life is worth lower oil prices. I think he is just absolutely evil.
6281 2018-11-21 18:18:56 Amen. Baguette cut into smaller pieces, in the oven with salt, pepper and oil.

6283 2018-11-21 18:18:53 Why must people harvest this palm oil and destroy habitat when they can grow it on a farm nearby and leave the apes alone. There's always a way around.
6284 2018-11-21 18:18:52 Zinke  and his posse of oil barons riding through the west, saving the environment by sending mustangs to slaughter, hunting down wildlife, and clear-cutting forests.
6285 2018-11-21 18:18:51 As oil is used to give light, similarly the Holy Spirit enlightens our hearts concerning our need of love in Jesus Christ.
6286 2018-11-21 18:18:44 *price of oil goes up* “It’s Trump’s fault, he sucks!”

*price of oil goes down* “It’s Trump’s fault, he sucks!”

Can’t have it both ways, people.
6287 2018-11-21 18:18:43 Axios-There are two kinds of oil on the market. Trump used a near-peak price of one to make the near-bottom price of the other seem more dramatic. One is $54, but was only at $75 in October Brent Crude is currently at $64 a barrel, and was at recent high of about $85 in Oct. LIAR
6288 2018-11-21 18:18:40 And supply a lot of oil!
6289 2018-11-21 18:18:40 You do know 40% of our oil comes from Canada right?
6290 2018-11-21 18:18:40 Beard oil go sort your patch patch problem. Try Jamacian Castor Oil.

6292 2018-11-21 18:18:37 I guess as long as people such as yourself believe oil is like having gold and innocent people especially journalists are murdered Saudi Arabia can bomb the middle of Wall Street and we're to praise them sounds familiar doesn't it!
6293 2018-11-21 18:18:35 Their floppy ursine rod slathered in cooking oil slithered into their cock cave
6294 2018-11-21 18:18:26 Follow-up: if they, hypothetically, wanted a few hours alone with Ivanka, but could get oil prices down to $35.... They promise not to kill her, of course... Is that a good deal?
6295 2018-11-21 18:18:22 The Latest: Cappadonna thanks Saudi Arabia for lower oil prices
6296 2018-11-21 18:18:20 King Faisal told Henry Kissinger "you are the ones who cant live without Oil, You know, we come from the desert, and our ancestors lived on dates and milk and we can easily go back and live like that again"

So here is your answer 
6297 2018-11-21 18:18:18 There is no 450B contract with USA. Saudi has only spent 14B. No arms contracts to be lost, and Saudi & USA don’t control oil prices. OPEC does. Trump is full of lies.
6298 2018-11-21 18:18:12 oil pastels are amazing
6299 2018-11-21 18:18:09 Canadians ... who already sell you 40% of your oil. You know us, the democratic country about which Mr. Trump can never say anything nice. I assure you, we haven't slaughtered anyone in any of our consulates ... ever.
6300 2018-11-21 18:18:08 Do you have any idea how many oil field workers will be out of work because of this? You must be the dumbest man alive.
6301 2018-11-21 18:18:04 why tf is it so hard to find ppl who sell thc oil cartridges in brooklyn
6302 2018-11-21 18:18:00 @realDonaldTramp You talk about oil prices going lower. You miss the point - how much lower can YOU go in representing our country? Where are your morals? I am ashamed to have you represent my country!
6303 2018-11-21 18:17:59 You traded a man’s life and our moral high ground in the world so you & Saudi Arabia could manipulate oil prices? You think this makes you look good? You could not be more wrong.
6304 2018-11-21 18:17:57 Correct, but a funny thing would happen if we all stopped buying oil from one country.

Can't happen though, it all get a imported through the same terminals for refining and then gets sold from there.

No way on the consumer side to isolate oil product from one country.
6305 2018-11-21 18:17:54 Im sure there are a lot of backflips still to come for the state to explain how this request to taxpayers to pay for a corporation’s oil pipeline tunnel isn’t a broken promise. Just a few weeks ago they said Enbridge would pay for everything
6306 2018-11-21 18:17:53 PREZ DT:Yes- USGovt business sale of defense equipment  to ally -S.Arabia is V. Important & reducing oil price help- also by :NOT  CONDONING Prince Salman of Khasshogi

6307 2018-11-21 18:17:47 i don't even know how to respond to this,,,,,, that's it, u won (but oil pastels still suck)
6308 2018-11-21 18:17:40 Why should taxpayers pick up the cost of abandoned wells? This is a black mark on the oil industry and shows a lack of respect for Albertans. Clean up your mess, @OilGasCanada #ableg

6314 2018-11-21 18:17:29 And how about OUR oil companies? We need the prices to trend higher to hero OUR people working
6315 2018-11-21 18:17:29 TRUMP calculates, probably correctly, the oil and gas industry will vote for him again in 2020
They may not be enthusiastic about him but they’ll be even less enthusiastic about his Democratic Party opponent 
Trump’s marginal voter is in FL and OH not TX
6316 2018-11-21 18:17:26 Jamal Khashoggi. An American reporter. Killed. But, if you mention Oil prices dropping everyone Will forget him and the Saudis part in his death
6317 2018-11-21 18:17:23 Wondering how many in the Trumpsphere have shorted oil stocks this year.
6318 2018-11-21 18:17:18 No, you can't get any lower than overlooking the murder of a journalist in favor of low oil prices and lining the Trump family pockets. You really are disgusting. More disgusting, though, is your deeply hypocritical fundamentalist base.
6319 2018-11-21 18:17:16 Leave the Union sctre Westminister and Torres.Scotland is smart and get a up bogus old treaty be an independent nationKEEP THE SCOT OIL GUARD IT

(See FAKER Bob Corker attack Trump (for PEACEFUL oil TRADE with SAUDI ARABIA) . Jesus is the Lord .
6321 2018-11-21 18:17:12 surprise! it's the oil
6322 2018-11-21 18:17:09 Psychological research has shown that humans remember & focus more on negative than positive, generally. Possibly an evolutionary adaptation; being more sensitive or attuned to threat helps us survive.
6323 2018-11-21 18:17:08 The US gets more oil from Canada. Less than 10% from Saudi Arabia.

dt's getting something from the Saudis.

He's a mobster thru and thru.  
6324 2018-11-21 18:17:07 Oh gosh! I almost accidentally sprayed puppyfresh deodorant on my aged Galician dairy cow steak instead of XV olive oil spray. Bottles similar !!!
6325 2018-11-21 18:17:07 More blood for oil, you infant? You're more easily played than Candyland.
6326 2018-11-21 18:17:07 I'm looking for a GIS job in any electricity distribution company or oil and gas. I have an MSC. In Geographic Informations System and one year working experience.
6327 2018-11-21 18:17:04 Canada supplies the US with most of its oil!
6328 2018-11-21 18:17:04 I use it for the TMJ I get with my jaw, I have a balm for direct application and the oil to put drops under my tongue. I find it generally helps the muscles relax and I normally get a better night's sleep. Let me know if you have any other questions x
6329 2018-11-21 18:17:03 Why am I so obsessed with essential oils lol ... I'm really down to pay 20-30 dollars on a tiny as bottle of oil...
6330 2018-11-21 18:17:00 He’s as smart as a barrel of oil
6331 2018-11-21 18:16:58 Plunging oil prices are not good for high cost fracking companies in the US but that’s a different issue that @realDonaldTrump wouldn’t think about. Moreover, only 11% of our oil is imported from Saudi Arabia. It wasn’t that long ago that Trump bragged about oil independence.
6332 2018-11-21 18:16:58 we only buy 10% of our oil from SA
6333 2018-11-21 18:16:57 This just in:
@realDonaldTrump says:
"It was not Saudi Oil. I let Mohammed bin Salman off the hook because he reminds me of my favorite  Italian restaurant in Manhattan."
America First!
Italian restaurants second!
Saudi Arabia, Russia, North Korea tied for third!
#ImpeachTheMoron
6334 2018-11-21 18:16:51 President Carter + Henry Kissinger in 1974 made a deal with the Saudis for Petrodollar, proposed by globalist organization Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). Until you break that arrangement, not much will change. Should Saudis stop selling oil in USD, economy will likely tank.
6335 2018-11-21 18:16:45 $CL1 Oilly’s will have to learn the hard way.. Some guys will never learn.. Short of War in Straits of Harmuz, chasing oil in Dec is pointless..
6336 2018-11-21 18:16:42 Duhhhhhhh no take the peanut butter out if your ears 

Tick the Saudis off oil goes higher maybe stops flowing 
And need them to control the other reallly really bad boys in the neighborhood
6337 2018-11-21 18:16:42 I will not thank you for lower oil prices, you have nothing to do with it, you are so lost 
6338 2018-11-21 18:16:38 Ami, you forget where I live. Portland, where all the hippies retired long before the 90s retired here. The VAST majority of dreads that I have encountered are not well maintained, certainly not washed regularly, and the patchouli oil only covers up so much stench.
6339 2018-11-21 18:16:37 I couldnt make u eat taco bell if i covered it in thc oil lmaoo no nigga taco bell dont sell tree root soup u old health wealth ass nigga 
6340 2018-11-21 18:16:35 But oil prices are set globally and Saudi Arabia produces about 3 times as much as Canada. So Saudi Arabia has 3 times as much influence in oil supply than Canada.  Does not matter who we buy from.  This is what happens when you spin anything negative for Trump w/o thinking.
6341 2018-11-21 18:16:31 All done. Fresh oil, fresh brake fluid, electrical systems a-ok, and they even gave it a hoover and a nath for me! Sorted for winter (though I’ll be staying inside where it’s warm if it snows lots!)
6342 2018-11-21 18:16:25 Excuse me for asking or playing devils advocate.. What mitigation plans are being put fourth & publicly announced instead of just saying no to fossils fuels & cursing big oil? What is our plan as a movement to mitigate? If we have no coherent plan why should anyone listen to us?
6343 2018-11-21 18:16:24 So murdering a journalist is a-ok for you and long as oil prices go lower. #yousuck
6344 2018-11-21 18:16:10 Apple cider vinegar and olive oil helped my friend. I could be really graphic but I won't, but he *saw* the toxins that came out of his body
6345 2018-11-21 18:16:00 Also, doesn't America get 40% of its oil from Canada, the country about which Mr. Trump can't say anything nice ? I can assure you, we haven't slaughtered anyone, anywhere recently. I understand that facts are unimportant to him.
6346 2018-11-21 18:15:59 I’m getting my oil changed at Firestone and I just watched the man laugh at my keys are you kidding sorry I like sparkly hand sanitizer
6347 2018-11-21 18:15:52 They don't kick off like this when the price of a barrel of oil goes down do they?
Mind you, neither do I. But I'm a grown up TBF.
6348 2018-11-21 18:15:51 Donald Trump thanked Saudi Arabia for low oil prices after they killed a journalist. They are currently pushing for cuts to rise prices and the US gets 40% of its oil from Canada #BlowMindsWithATweet
6349 2018-11-21 18:15:50 Canada's role in this is nothing to be proud of.

Unlike Norway (8th largest oil exporter in the world) where 55% of all vehicles sold are electric, in Canada, it's a pathetic 2%.  If you listen to car commercials, you'd swear that electric vehicles didn't even exist!

6352 2018-11-21 18:15:44 Gosh.  Maybe if a few more journalists are cut into pieces with a bone saw and you do nothing about it, oil will hit $40.  Idiot.
6353 2018-11-21 18:15:37 It's coming, slowly. Imagine EVERYONE in the oil, nuclear and power industries suddenly being unemployed .. what would happen in countries producing oil 

There is a box (about the size of two shoe boxes) that can power your home forever .. what would happen if it were released?
6354 2018-11-21 18:15:35 Do you know anything about either economics or the oil markets? Do you imagine that the Sa'udis are trying to keep prices low now?
6355 2018-11-21 18:15:34 Speak French! Or I dunno, uphold the rule of law, sell 40% of your total oil imports.
6356 2018-11-21 18:15:30 You’d think a furnace cleaning would include a new filter  

When you get the oil changed in the car they don’t put back the dirty filter

The Saudis should have lower the oil prices before the scandal. How badly did they threaten YOUR bottom line. We all know it's Trump first not America. Disgraceful!!!
6360 2018-11-21 18:15:18 Yes they deep fry them whole in peanut oil. It’s delicious actually but it can be a fire hazard. 
6361 2018-11-21 18:15:15 Heard on a news story that in 2 weeks, oil prices are going to go up.  Enjoy your gas prices for now.

6367 2018-11-21 18:15:09 @realDonaldTrump Our people will win when Iran's oil exports are completely cut off; other sanctions are not worth much.
6368 2018-11-21 18:15:09 As the oil in a lamp gives light, it is GOD's desire to cast out all darkness from our lives  and to keep us fully in the LIGHT of His love!
6369 2018-11-21 18:15:07 Oil & Money in exchange for blowing off a man's butchering murder, it's unconscionable, it's the idiot.
6370 2018-11-21 18:15:07 Canada does not control oil prices the way OPEC does. Saudi Arabia is the second largest producer behind the United States. Without SA, prices would go much higher. The same can't be said of Canada. He thanked the right country. You miss the point.
6371 2018-11-21 18:15:07 Me: Work is letting me out early today so I'm going to get my car's oil changed, work out, and then go to Wegmans to prep for tomorrow!

Me two hours later: *Goes home to play #PokemonLetsGo  for hours and neglects all responsibility*
6372 2018-11-21 18:15:07 Why would Saudi Arabia want lower oil prices
6373 2018-11-21 18:15:06 Fake!!! We only get 11% of our oil from Saudi Arabia. You're a liar who's in over his head. Please resign before cholesterol takes you down.
6374 2018-11-21 18:15:06 Shale oil reminds me of scraping the barrel for the very last drop. There has to be an oil field somewhere in America that is sizable to the Saudi's oil supply. And why aren't we tapping that. We have the technology to do so.

6376 2018-11-21 18:15:00 @realDonaldTrump FOR THE WAKE OF OIL U SELL HUMANITY ...COMMON PRESIDENT LET HUMANITY PREVAILS OTHERWISE THE WORLD WILL BE A BUSINESS#RIP KASHOGGI
6377 2018-11-21 18:14:58 Trump fails to realize most the oil used by the United States doesn’t come from Saudi Arabia. We understand only about 11% comes from the Saudi’s. Why is Trump so dumb?
6378 2018-11-21 18:14:55 It's not voter suppression.  Redrawing a district doesnt prevent anyone from voting.
6379 2018-11-21 18:14:54 Only because you have depressed Canadian oil prices to the point where we may just stop drilling. Just saying, considering you get over 40% of your oil from Canada. We don’t chop up people we don’t agree with.
6380 2018-11-21 18:14:54 I think $54 a barrel is enough for customers & manufactures not, to mention the Oil companies themselves !! At $45 there were layoffs in the Oil industry all over !! At $55 is perfect for everyone ... Just my opinion..
6381 2018-11-21 18:14:53 Hey, let oil prices rise a little... I’d pay more for gas if Trump would condemn the Saudi’s for dismembering a journalist. It’s sickening that he’s putting money ahead of human lives.
6382 2018-11-21 18:14:47 Hi Cathy.....you know that’s made from OIL right??
6383 2018-11-21 18:14:44 Tbh tho I want a fine cuisine cooking channel for food enthusiasts that’s accessible (aka no I don’t have those gadgets/truffle oil what do I use instead) and I think Bon apétits test kitchen is the closest anyone has ever got to that??
6384 2018-11-21 18:14:42 Oil is at a low price
6385 2018-11-21 18:14:42 Considering the vast majority of our imported oil comes from Canada and Mexico and he makes a point of pissing them off, how does this make a difference for Americans?
6386 2018-11-21 18:14:42 Hey Prez, when oil gets to low like $45bbl, the Oil and Gas Industry slows way down on drilling, lots of lost jobs, I went through two really bad ones during the Obama years and lost everything. I live in Texas and work in this industry. You should rethink your position, quick
6387 2018-11-21 18:14:41 Overwhelmed with lots ppl texting me and motivate me to not sad. Im sad cz i burned the midnight oil the night bfore, preparing everything tht i cld but still cant do it properly. But im okey rn hahahahaha, this is just the beginning.
6388 2018-11-21 18:14:38 How are you selling that to the oil Patch community
6389 2018-11-21 18:14:38 @realDonaldTrump  I'm sure the regime's work in Iran is complete, the key to regime change in Iran is just oil. Until Iranian exports of oil are completely cut off, they will not let the Iranian regime go
6390 2018-11-21 18:14:32 Please remind all that Canada is the biggest exporter of oil to the US and only 11% is from SA. Even with this prices at the pumps in Canada average around $5.20/gl. We go about our day normally and don’t have a shitty un-patriotic leader bad mouthing us every second.
6391 2018-11-21 18:14:30 Ah he traded the mess for lower oil prices
6392 2018-11-21 18:14:26 Besides, US oil production will keep prices down
6393 2018-11-21 18:14:24 We got lower oil prices!!!! Thats a win win in my book.
6394 2018-11-21 18:14:20 At the current rate, the Tesla Gigafactory will supplant 2 million barrels of oil demand in about 5 years.
There are many more mega and gigafactories under construction at this very moment.
Stick with oil at your own peril. Smart money is already leaving fossil fuels.
6395 2018-11-21 18:14:20 2/2... if this was the only true reason for him to put his tail between his legs, I'd gladly pay more for oil if it meant the degenerates were held accountable for this atrocity. R you kidding me?
6396 2018-11-21 18:14:14 1/2... no words to express the disgusting disdain that is created as a result of #POTUS valuing oil/relationships/etc over a human life.
6397 2018-11-21 18:14:12 Oil was at 53$ when Obama left office, and he didn't need to thank any murderers.
6398 2018-11-21 18:14:08 Have you seen your gas prices change in the last 2 years?
Low oil prices hurt production (jobs) in the USA      Wake Up!
6399 2018-11-21 18:14:02 Agreed. This horrific disregard of life to preserve his business interests. 

Since this is all about money, maybe his oil donors and the Red States will finally figure out its TRUMP FIRST.  Lower profits for oil companies equate to cuts in exploration, jobs, and tax revenue.
6400 2018-11-21 18:14:01 Just FYI, #DearCustomer - standing at the back of the store and bellowing "COD LIVER OIL! GLUCOSAMINE!" is not an appropriate way to ask for assistance. #RetailProblems
6401 2018-11-21 18:13:53 Anyone that believes Trump has anything to do with oil prices dropping clearly has no understanding of how the world works
6402 2018-11-21 18:13:48 Doesn't that actually hurt the US oil companies?
6403 2018-11-21 18:13:48 Oil prices are up for this time of year.

6407 2018-11-21 18:13:18 Oil and gas prices are still higher than when he took office. Enough higher that they 'soak up' more than any tax cut except for corporations and millionaires.
6408 2018-11-21 18:13:15 The USA gets 40% of its oil from Trump enemy, Canada, & 11% from his 2nd favorite state, Saudi Arabia

Why does he hate 1 & love the other?

Canada doesn’t launder money through Trump Org & took his name off a hotel in Toronto. 

Saudi Arabia funnels money into Trump’s coffers.

6412 2018-11-21 18:13:02 @realDonaldTrump and this is the core of resistance that you heard in the media; this core of resistance is in the mission to support the Iranian regime; their main mission is to ensure that Iran's oil exports do not reach zero; Iran's oil exports To zero,

6417 2018-11-21 18:12:53 Interesting 'trade' for lower oil price.
6418 2018-11-21 18:12:53 Oil outweighs human life. Got it.
6419 2018-11-21 18:12:52 What happened to America First? Doesn't that apply to jobs, less dependence on foreign oil. You guys are so good at chants I seem to remember Drill baby Drill the last few election cycles. How dumb is this guy?
6420 2018-11-21 18:12:45 I’m no fan of the Saudi’s but I need more evidence that a strike on one of their largest oil customers was ordered by a political leader before I’m full blown war mode.

This is about the Trump family (extended) admiration for royalty.
6425 2018-11-21 18:12:37 Raise our oil prices. He gives you no reason to help us out. Stick it to this clown.
6426 2018-11-21 18:12:34 That oil prices are $1 higher a gal in the NE US than they were when @POTUS44 was in office. That prices are cheaper is fake news. That 45 green lights the murder of journalists. That his ties to Saudi Arabia are linked to his own financial well being. We could do this all day.
6427 2018-11-21 18:12:33 My guess is petro $. If KSA drops US $,China & Russia eager to trade in gold-backed currencies. US economy wd be hit hard. US is energy independent. With glut of oil & low prices,NDakota oil fields will start laying off. Oil 2 low or 2 high-we're screwed either way.
6428 2018-11-21 18:12:30 This is simply insane, oil for human. Only in Trump’s world!
6429 2018-11-21 18:12:27 It isn't the oil, it is personal real estate dealings.
6430 2018-11-21 18:12:27 This has been predicted for months...OPEC is slowing production because the market is saturated with oil. This has zero to do with you and your murderous buddies.
6431 2018-11-21 18:12:26 We get most of our oil from CANADA. You know, the country that you keep deriding. You’re endorsing regimes who murder journalists critical of the regime.
6432 2018-11-21 18:12:23 Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia. that's probably news to you "mr. president"
6433 2018-11-21 18:12:22 The game here between the Americans and the Saudis is to lower the oil price to  apply the worst  economic pain  on Iran and Russia .

6437 2018-11-21 18:12:13 Millions have died in the Middle East because of these wars over control of oil and now we have morals? Ha ha funny
6438 2018-11-21 18:12:11 it’s a tough question, if we stop buying oil and supporting there military they’ll just turn to another nation for it( China or Russia most likely) and an overthrow would just be throwing another nation down the road of Syria where extremist have a shot at seizing power
6439 2018-11-21 18:12:08 You and your cult followers can keep that few cents blood money. I don’t want cheaper oil at the cost of people’s lives.  Humanity above money!

6441 2018-11-21 18:12:03 Sanjay bhai 
Ur fully correct during UPA time once crude oil price hiked. But tht was momentarily not for long 10yrs. 

Also tht time there was no trade war betwn USA & China. 
Now due to trade war except dollar & Yen all currencies crippled. Modi managing well, feel proud.
6442 2018-11-21 18:12:02 Make no mistake about it: Resource extractivism, whether it be oil, gas or mining is linked to Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. #MMIW #standwithoursisters #extractivism @UNMHarjo

6444 2018-11-21 18:11:59 It’s not millions. 

Refugees were created by doing war so that America could control the oil distribution or created by the world financial system(Wallstreet) that devaluates the currency of countries so we can buy(steal) their resources.
6445 2018-11-21 18:11:58 REALITY CHECK!!!
 "Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia."
6446 2018-11-21 18:11:58 Not sure what the game here is. US "energy dominance" pretty much needs high oil prices because US oil costs more than Saudi, even Russian. Is this just Trumpian "winning", no matter what?
6447 2018-11-21 18:11:54 Where is the thank you tweet from Trump to Canada for crippling our own export capabilities and providing oil to them well below world prices?  We have done more to reduce fuel prices in the US than the Saudis have.
6448 2018-11-21 18:11:54 Canada is the largest source of oil imported to USA
6449 2018-11-21 18:11:50 I've yet to see the lower oil prices make their way to the gas pumps...sad
6450 2018-11-21 18:11:44 @realDonaldTrump has just tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to 'a big Tax Cut for America and the World!' In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
6451 2018-11-21 18:11:40 Get everyone properly registered with an ID.

All the effort and expense to oppose this is multiples of the effort and expense of just getting people the proper documentation, for the relatively few that dont have it.
6452 2018-11-21 18:11:39 It’s very troublesome that you don’t even understand what impacts the price of oil. It’s equally disturbing to see you thank Saudi. We only get 11% oil from them. Further, they murdered one of our journalists & sent 15 of the 19 terrorists here to destroy the Twin Towers.  you!
6453 2018-11-21 18:11:36 I used to purify ZnCl2 and trimethyl ammonium chloride back in grad school. Both worked pretty well, but for the latter, you need to do it in an oil bath to make sure the temperate does not go too high (<130-140 degrees).
6454 2018-11-21 18:11:35 Cristiiiiinnne you’re the only one who has the RIGHT answers when it comes to NAILS.. is jojoba oil colorless? And is the consistency thick? I bought it but it’s light weight on skin and absorbs quickly
6455 2018-11-21 18:11:33 US imported Oil from Saudi Arabia = 11%. US imported Oil from Canada = 40%. He’s trying to fool his trumptards and Fox News/Republican Congress will help out.
6456 2018-11-21 18:11:31 Girl, I hope you know you don't gotta warm your car up. Its been proven wasteful. Your car heats the oil quicker at full speed. So just take off and go be fabulous.
6457 2018-11-21 18:11:28 Not war but we do not have to take their oil. Or anything from them.
6458 2018-11-21 18:11:26 America is drilling, producing and refining more oil than ever before...America is currently giving the Arabs a run for the largest oil producing country in the world! That might have a major effect on pricing! Family is in the oil business & I can tell you everyone is drilling!
6459 2018-11-21 18:11:24 But oil prices are down. You missed that.

6464 2018-11-21 18:11:13 By the way, the lower oil price was by no means decided or even influenced by Saudi Arabia!
6465 2018-11-21 18:11:12 Our morals for lower oil prices.
6466 2018-11-21 18:11:11 We are the largest supplier of mostly really crude, crude oil (bitumen) which is refined in the US. We buy back some. We don’t refine oil in Canada.
6467 2018-11-21 18:11:10 Society can move past the hydrocarbon era and make the oil industry a niche player with limited subsidies and political power.  We have the tech.  We need the leadership. The planet will thank us.
6468 2018-11-21 18:11:09 WE, by that I mean the beings that enjoy convenience at the peril of future generations are responsible for ignoring calls for change for nearly half a century ALONG with the oil company's that knew Will never be held responsible for what we've committed the future to, shame. . .

6471 2018-11-21 18:11:07 Except IEA forecasts an INCREASED oil demand over next few decades. Get a freaking clue. Tesla is almost gone anyway.
6472 2018-11-21 18:11:05 No there is no relation btw oil & $weed. The earlier has its brightest days in the rear view mirror while the later seems to have its bright days way ahead of it... 
Totally opposites...
6473 2018-11-21 18:10:59 It’s not just when I’m eating- can happen at any time. Not 100% sure what triggers it- overthinking, worrying about things,feeling inferior, insecurity- the list goes on. What has helped a lot is CBD oil. Unfortunately have run out - some arriving soon thankfully.
6474 2018-11-21 18:10:58 I'm pretty sure we produce more oil than any other country right now.
6475 2018-11-21 18:10:56 I think the subtext of all Thanksgiving food writing is about the writer's relationship with their own family, and what mom said 28 years ago that they're still furious about. So yeah, throw the whole thing into a vat of boiling oil, let it catch fire and laugh when it explodes.
6476 2018-11-21 18:10:49 Actually we are a net exporter of oil so ..no kashoggi in my gas tank.
6477 2018-11-21 18:10:48 I happy to see, that lower oil prices are more important than a man's life.
6478 2018-11-21 18:10:48 Glad the temp change helped. Wish I was there to trade you something for it cuz I’ve always liked it. Maybe you could use it for Bulletproof coffee. The butter and coconut oil will cover a multitude of sins.

6481 2018-11-21 18:10:40 Are we still talking about oil?

6483 2018-11-21 18:10:39 That’s right...because Trunp could sacrifice you to Saudi to lower oil prices......
6484 2018-11-21 18:10:39 Nor do the Saudis have much to do with the price of oil, much less the price of gas.
6485 2018-11-21 18:10:36 We have "Free Energy" for all ...

IT would cause MASSIVE unemployment
6486 2018-11-21 18:10:32 Also, just to be clear, you’re saying gerrymandering IS voter suppression. Which is what I was asked to prove. Thanks for reinforcing my statement of fact.
6487 2018-11-21 18:10:30 Oil is down, leave em alone, lol
6488 2018-11-21 18:10:26 I read DT’s statement several times to believe a POTUS would ever brag about how low oil prices are! The commodity that supports the livelihood of so many.....in the tank. Awful on so many levels...except a cheaper drive to Grandma’s house for Thanksgiving. OMG
6489 2018-11-21 18:10:20 あいて…ちょっとエルザにスリーサイズ聞いただけなのに殴られた…
6490 2018-11-21 18:10:19 Agree, however, others never compromised our democracy.  Also, oil prices are dropping bc of the glut of oil on the market of which the USA produces the majority, NOT bc we get our oil from the Saudis. Research it.  All true. Trump sides w/dictators. Why?
6491 2018-11-21 18:10:18 No doubt with help from Scottish oil revenue. #cashcow
6492 2018-11-21 18:10:12 . Now not only has the president said “meh” to Saudi Arabia murdering a US resident and journalists, but now he is thanking them for lower oil prices? Fuck that. What the fuck us wrong with this asshole?
6493 2018-11-21 18:10:12 I had a dream this morning that you started #THT #TeslaHeavy division for #hydrofoil and retractable solar roof for oil tankers and cargo ships. Tesla Heavy Transportation.
6494 2018-11-21 18:10:12 Never buy a mercedes or Bmw with 100 k miles oil leaks for days
6495 2018-11-21 18:10:11 Mr. Trump, the oil and gas industry has supported for 2 years, but this isn't how you keep it. We need to make money too. #americafirst #oilandgas #makeoilandgasgreatagain #makeamericagreatagain
6496 2018-11-21 18:10:10 Low oil prices? 

Have you driven across California lately, muthafucka?

I paid less than a dollar per gallon in the mid 90's, dude. These prices aren't low.
6497 2018-11-21 18:10:09 I rinse the brine (I make gravy, so is too salty), then use a mix of avacado oil and butter. Olive doesn’t tast great. I add seasonings like sage, rosemary, pepper, etc. But I’m a flavor fiend!
6498 2018-11-21 18:10:08 @realdonaIdlump @potus @gop @FoxNews - You day you’ve helped keep the price of oil down? Obviously, you do not fill your on vehicle with gas. It is the most expensive it has been in 4-years. Yeah, keep making up your own erroneous statistics. You are so frickin out of touch!
6499 2018-11-21 18:10:08 I had dream oil is trading at $10
6500 2018-11-21 18:10:02 君を笑わせるためなら、僕は尻から油を出すよ。
6501 2018-11-21 18:10:00 That is because 40% of US oil comes from low Canadian crude oil pricing.  Nothing to do with the Saudi Arabia.  #IdiotInChief #eastwestpipeline
6502 2018-11-21 18:09:58 Yeah!  Boycott Saudi oil now!
6503 2018-11-21 18:09:57 I’m Canadian & offended “for Americans” that Trump condones slaughter of journalist employed by U.S., then says to you buddy-buddy “hey look cheap oil” like handing you a sucker after demeaning you to the world watching. As educated people it has to offend you. @washingtonpost
6504 2018-11-21 18:09:56 You would think someone in the dysfunctional world of @realDonaldTrump would inform him that the United States is the world's largest oil producer. But, since that happened under the Obama administration I guess all of his cronies are mute.
6505 2018-11-21 18:09:50 A spy gets killed in Saudi Arabia and the American press goes into hysterics! They want us to stop selling military equipment to SA and stop buying their oil! Do they have any idea how that would impower Iran? And how many spies does our CIA kill every day? Wise up and MAGA!
6506 2018-11-21 18:09:50 Someone should explain to you where our oil comes from.  Hint: it’s not 1979 and it’s not Saudi Arabia.
6507 2018-11-21 18:09:48 CANADA is the biggest supplier of Oil to the US!! Where is our praise? Oh right not enough BRIBES sent to you to Buy your praise! #TrumpTraitor
6508 2018-11-21 18:09:46 When you forgot to bring your switch with you to get your oil change so instead you drink less than mediocre coffee and browse twitter
6509 2018-11-21 18:09:44 Donald, oil prices don't work that way. They're based on global supply and demand, no wonder your businesses went bankrupt so many times.
6510 2018-11-21 18:09:43 Never mind that Canada imports roughly 40 percent of our oil. #Dolt45
6511 2018-11-21 18:09:39 I sell organic oil for hair/skin care and black soap suitable for all skin types.
6512 2018-11-21 18:09:37 Got cool humidifier on with tea tree oil, using Nose Frida and saline, lots of warm fluids. My poor three year old is sick!
So help me internet: HOW IN THE HELL do you teach a kid to blow their nose? She just tries to snort it back up and then chokes herself.
6513 2018-11-21 18:09:36 No we're not scared to. We're just corrupt and we love them because cheap oil. Saudi can't do shit. They live off of us and the Europeans and everyone else because we buy their fucking oil.
6514 2018-11-21 18:09:35 Not so good for our oil industry or oil and gas workers who have already seen their jobs cut by 40% in the last 3 years.
6515 2018-11-21 18:09:34 สมัยเคโอติกโดนล้อสำเนียงต่างชาติสองคนแต่ฟิลลิ่งความเป็นนักร้องเขาได้นาเหวยย
6516 2018-11-21 18:09:30 Less digging for oil and polluting the sea!
6517 2018-11-21 18:09:30 Yes, I think they use coconut oil or something. It resembles a normal burger well enough that I doubt I would have known it wasn't if I hadn't already been told.
6518 2018-11-21 18:09:30 Nuclear power has become much safer than it used to, but oil companies once again lobbied the govt to prevent the business from becoming an alternative to fuel
6519 2018-11-21 18:09:28 Trump is a moron if he thinks Saudi Arabia "lowered" the price of oil to accommodate the US. This huge drop signifies billions lost. They'll probably cut production this week.
6520 2018-11-21 18:09:28 Naah, there are a lot of gentle and coll ppl there, it'll be an intellectual house with a lot of knowledge sharing, all I see is elite mind
6521 2018-11-21 18:09:27 US gets 40% of it’s oil from Canada, and 11% from Saudi Arabia. SA bought him years ago.
6522 2018-11-21 18:09:20 We import far more oil from Canada than Saudi Arabia. And SA has been seeking to increase the price. So thanks for nothing. Interesting that you are all cozy with the county that was largely responsible for the terrorist attack of 9/11.
6523 2018-11-21 18:09:16 I don’t  oil field money baby
6524 2018-11-21 18:09:13 40% of oil comes from Canada. 11% from Saudi.  Now, who does the numbers????
6525 2018-11-21 18:09:11 I figured that Saudi Arabia would bribe @potus with lower oil prices. No thanks! I’d rather pay higher prices than support murderous regimes.
6526 2018-11-21 18:09:06 people like low gas prices. That's all they see - how much it costs to fill up.  So by upping US production and driving up supplies US oil producers are making consumer confidence higher. Since this is the way people "feel" the economy it's a positive for trump.
6527 2018-11-21 18:09:04 Oil prices are not defined by a single producer. Defined by supply and demand involving all the producing countries and Saudi Arabia as a major oil producer
6528 2018-11-21 18:09:02 So are you claiming that Canada drives the oil prices?  What do their exports have to do with crude prices?  Everyone knows that OPEC is the main driver for controlling production and the world wide crude price...
6529 2018-11-21 18:09:01 How about thanking our OWN oil producers??....   
6530 2018-11-21 18:09:01 In spite of reduced crude price our oil companies are not reducing the price proportionately.
6531 2018-11-21 18:09:00 Since my  country supplies 40% of America's foreign oil Trump's lips should be firmly planted on our hairy Canadian asses.   Just saying.
6532 2018-11-21 18:08:59 Kashoggi is murdered and the crowd here is outraged, even preposterously arguing the President ordered it, but when the US Ambassador to Libya was murdered Obama goes to sleep early or watches Turkish oil wrestling and Hillary says "what difference does it make"?
6533 2018-11-21 18:08:57 .@BarryPetten asks the Minister for an update on the seabirds and other sea life which may have been impacted by the oil spill #nlpoli
6534 2018-11-21 18:08:55 What a great face oil!
6535 2018-11-21 18:08:54 Why is it that every time my POS car goes in for an oil change it somehow always ends up costing hundreds of dollars 
6536 2018-11-21 18:08:52 CBD oil is the only thing I’ve found that actually works
6537 2018-11-21 18:08:49 Is he nuts? Trump rather celebrates the savings of a few pennies on oil prices than be angry about an American journalist being slain by Saudi killers. He swears our relationship with Saudi Arabia isn’t about the money. We can see that’s not true!
6538 2018-11-21 18:08:48 Without Saudi recycling petrodollars into the NYSE and guaranteeing that oil is priced in USD thus upholding the status of the USD as the worlds reserve currency, the US is sunk. Trump is v smart.
6539 2018-11-21 18:08:46 I mean I’ll but a boy expensive skincare but I draw the line at literal mineral oil
6540 2018-11-21 18:08:41 An enterprising field that would prevent global warming and pollution is hydrogen fuel. It’s safer and can be made safer. However, oil companies lobby to prevent hydrogen fuel from becoming viable, and hydrogen fuel entrepreneurs cannot make enough money to sustain the project
6541 2018-11-21 18:08:37 Being an oil bear has worked out quite well for me in the last year. However, I am open to other data. Feel free to provide a source for your bull views.
6542 2018-11-21 18:08:35 trump is selling the soul of America for a barrel of oil.
6543 2018-11-21 18:08:34 Don't we produce enough oil for ourselves? Stop defending a country that willingly killed a person. #WorstPresident #LockHimUp #Impeach45 #trumpcrimefamily

6546 2018-11-21 18:08:25 Is he getting a cut on oil sales?
6547 2018-11-21 18:08:22 @Econoday: Crude oil inventories rose 4.9 million barrels in the November 16 week to 446.9 million, 2.2 percent below their level a year...
6548 2018-11-21 18:08:19 I don't think the rba will cut rates because there is a swing in the dollar and not much room to move should their be further decline in the market which I am confident will happen as I see oil going down to about 46 dollars a barrel
6549 2018-11-21 18:08:16 Do you use hyaluronic acid in your skin routine? It really helps me a lot. I use that before my moisturizer and then put a cocoabutter lip balm on or a lip oil. Current favorite is ELF lip oil. Alternatively a really thick lip gloss because it traps the moisture in.
6550 2018-11-21 18:08:16 Yes I remember seeing a programme regarding Oil oh that was just horrific 
That was about greed.
Money can curupt so many people it's scary
6551 2018-11-21 18:08:15 Then eat ofada stew well, full pot. 
In fact, palm oil meals.

6554 2018-11-21 18:08:11 Saudia Arabia government trying to coverup murder corruption by paying with oil ? Can’t buy people with morals.. fact is a fact .

6561 2018-11-21 18:08:02 The vast majority of our oil does not come from Saudi Arabia, or Russia you fucknugget.
6562 2018-11-21 18:08:00 We all know you ate ignoramt, but maybe someone should tell you most of our oil comes from Canada.
6563 2018-11-21 18:07:59 Jamal Khashoggi. 
The de facto human sacrifice for lower oil prices. I think he should be sainted as a new age martyr. 

You what's sad? 
Soylent Green is people, and the walking dead might as well be reality television.
6564 2018-11-21 18:07:59 Correct---Per CNN Sept 2018---US unseats Russia and Saudi Arabia as No 1 oil producer...
6565 2018-11-21 18:07:54 A man was brutally murdered but you’re thanking them for oil prices?? You’re sick
6566 2018-11-21 18:07:53 Have you seen they treat those expatriate?? You'll see the Nigerian Police attaching 6 to 8 officers to just one because he works in an Oil company. You should visit Port Harcourt to see this thing yourself. It's so sad
6567 2018-11-21 18:07:51 La perforación en la CGSJ y el shale oil no creo que aguante Brent debajo de 55/60
6568 2018-11-21 18:07:48 You import more oil from us in Canada than you do from Saudi Arabia.
6569 2018-11-21 18:07:44 Great to have a Saudi Prince as POTUS. Apparently the Saudi's provide after hours services for the POTUS. MAGA, by SELLING OURSELVES for OIL.
6570 2018-11-21 18:07:39 I have a 20 lb shoulder pork roast in the oven. It’s cooking slowly at 350 deg. I won’t take it out until 6 PM tonight. I covered it in virgin olive oil, herbs , a white vinegar rub. My second base will be emulsified sun dried tomatoes w/a dash of citrus to gives it a finish.
6571 2018-11-21 18:07:38 Really wanna get some monq essential oil pens
6572 2018-11-21 18:07:35 Yes - love them, but only if oven roasted with olive oil, kosher salt and pepper.
6573 2018-11-21 18:07:32 They get so frustrating. I hate mine  I’m wearing my hair in braids everyday so that I don’t have to deal with them! Use coconut oil to help grow them out, that’s what I’ve been doing I also use coconut oil heat protectant if I do use heat and it’s helped a lot!!
6574 2018-11-21 18:07:30 My car still smells of stale mint after a bottle of such oil got out of hand in it years ago.  I have left them be after that.

From our Stock News Alerts App
6577 2018-11-21 18:07:23 I remember him blaming it on oil speculators. That's because he's dumb and I'm smart. He should've given the Saudis a free pass like I have and we woulda had thismtax cut sooner.
6578 2018-11-21 18:07:20 Are you out of your mind? The Saudis tortured Mr Khashoggi, then dismembered him using a bone saw—yet you are tweeting a thank you for lower oil prices. A thank you to his barbaric murderers. WTF. Depravity thy name is Trump. We are looking evil in the eyes @maddow @ChrisCuomo
6579 2018-11-21 18:07:20 I find CBD oil works for sleep too.
6580 2018-11-21 18:07:19 Let’s remove our dependence on foreign oil and make it illegal for our own oil companies to sell oil from our soil to foreign nations.
6581 2018-11-21 18:07:15 Blood for oil again. How’s the stock market today spanky?
6582 2018-11-21 18:07:14 Tell that to THE AMERICAN OIL PRODUCERS who lose their asses below $70 a barrel. #IdiotInChief
6583 2018-11-21 18:07:10 US is now largest exporter of oil. Low oil prices are BAD. Can fluctuate.
6584 2018-11-21 18:07:08 I totally get that. But she started the tutorial, said she let this marinate in a dry salt brine, then rubbed olive oil on top and stuck it in the oven. 

That’s it?? Salt and olive oil? Or am I missing something crucial?
6585 2018-11-21 18:07:04 The Saudis and OPEC control the price of oil. Canada has been a sharp critic. They will destroy us. Because they can.

6586 2018-11-21 18:07:02 Me at the auto repair shop:

“Will you change my oil?”

The guy starts walking to my car

“No. Will you change *my* oil?”
6587 2018-11-21 18:07:02 We are the biggest oil producing country, you foolish man.
6588 2018-11-21 18:07:01 This makes no sense. What is "real money"? Is oil "real money"?  Oil has real value all over the world but I can't use it to buy groceries either. How about uranium? That has real value. I'd like to trade one ounce of uranium for that bushel of bananas.
6589 2018-11-21 18:06:51 I know someone that sells on IG tho. Got my Tory Burch oil from her.
6590 2018-11-21 18:06:48 For Saudi but not oil consumers.
6591 2018-11-21 18:06:46 Nothing says “ Happy  Thanksgiving” like military being authorized to kill refuges  and thanking the Saudis for low oil prices.
6592 2018-11-21 18:06:45 Look everyone, more whataboutism to deflect from the fact that voter suppression is real. Your point doesn’t address her challenge. She’s asked me to prove voter suppression. I just did. You’re bad at this.
6593 2018-11-21 18:06:42 I'd rather pay higher taxes so we could invest money to find an alternative to gasoline. Then we can tell Saudi Arabia were they can put their oil.
6594 2018-11-21 18:06:42 How about eradicating palm oil from your products, that's the only way to stop deforestation in the industry.  #nosuchthingasresponsiblepalmoil
6595 2018-11-21 18:06:38 NO BLOOD FOR OIL! SHAMEFUL!  YOU ARE DIGGING HOLES IN THE HOLES!  FLAMES LICKING YOUR FAT ASS!
6596 2018-11-21 18:06:37 If you’re kicking off about palm oil but still supporting animal agriculture you are actually a dumb cunt 
6597 2018-11-21 18:06:36 Nope didn’t work for me. Castle oil is awesome
6598 2018-11-21 18:06:36 Oil prices are in good shape because we are producing more crude oil domestically than ever before. We don’t really need Saudi oil. Cut off the Saudis economically. Oops, forgot about your hotel and other personal business interests there.
6599 2018-11-21 18:06:33 Sanctions could drive oil to 200, not selling them arms may work but the uk, russia or china woumd sell them, who do u prefder to be the dealer?
6600 2018-11-21 18:06:32 Oh lets see.  In the middle of the worst oil price crash in a generation she proposed a royalty review, upped corporate taxes, added a a carbon tax, did not fight for energy east, northern gateway or defend Keystone!  She was going to get social license first and got nothing!

6602 2018-11-21 18:06:31 Saudi Arabia - Aren’t we the US the leading producer of oil now? Jesus 
6603 2018-11-21 18:06:31 The price of oil
6604 2018-11-21 18:06:31 Canada (40%), Saudi Arabia (11%), Venezuela (9%), Mexico (8%), and Colombia (4%). According to the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and natural gas industry supports nine million U.S. jobs and makes up seven percent of the nation's gross domestic product.
6605 2018-11-21 18:06:28 That's terrible... 
If only the USA had it's own oil reserves and could be independent...
Oh, hang on...
It does!
6606 2018-11-21 18:06:26 OK all you tRUMP'YS so as long as we get lower oil prices then its ok to kill american citizens?  Realy is that what its come to. MONEY MONEY MONEY you bunch of sick son of a bitches. It is NOT OK TO KILL PEOPLE FOR MONEY NO MATTER WHAT. EVER....
6607 2018-11-21 18:06:25 Is that a covert Code word to someone in the Saudi Government?  and by the way there are ALOT of families who would like to see the Oil business in AMERICA grow and boost the AMERICAN economy......
6608 2018-11-21 18:06:24 I have a lots of followers and it occors to me that I should make sure i am not blackmailable. I am a exdrugaddict I used to use pot and still do use Cannabidiol oil for pain. I am a ex alcoholic have done many things i am not proud of. There is nothing I  have done that someone
6609 2018-11-21 18:06:23 The guy sef fall hand, he shouldn't have said the truth. He should have said he works with an oil company and he is on leave. 
6610 2018-11-21 18:06:19 How many #Yemen children blood libel to get your desired oil prices?
6611 2018-11-21 18:06:19 I believe most Americans would rather pay a few more cents for oil than approve   Saudi Arabia killing a journalist. #dumptrump
6612 2018-11-21 18:06:17 Just be positive and hug more people. Maybe the NHL should share the Stanley Cup more so the millennials can all celebrate mediocracy. Seems like anything after 2018 needs an Asterix because it is somehow not really earned anymore.
6613 2018-11-21 18:06:15 Just like with Russia. If we aren't nuking them for their 'crime', then its not good enough.

Saudi killed a Saudi resident. 

Do I like it?  No. 

Do we give up possibilty of peace in middle east because of it? HELL NO.
6614 2018-11-21 18:06:12 Petten asking who has responsibilities to clean oil spill. Coady says no reports of Sheens. Multiple flyovers. Husky’s responsibility to clean if oil found.
6615 2018-11-21 18:06:10 No reason for our gas prices to be high. We produce more oil than Saudi Arabia.
6616 2018-11-21 18:06:07 Trump just thanked Saudi Arabia for oil prices when he should have condemned them for wacking a journalist. #notmypresident
6617 2018-11-21 18:06:07 That's very true and people are saying that. I don't let the death of the enemy of America stand in the way of low cost oil or kushner loans. I say we line up all journalists and put them all down. Then everything will be cheaper.
6618 2018-11-21 18:06:05 Getting the price of oil from 84 to 54 dollars a barrel isn’t exactly bending over grabbing your ankles for Saudi Arabia and if they want to kill it each other off, no problem!
6619 2018-11-21 18:06:05 I HATE it when people discount the positive changes you’re making because they aren’t “enough”.

Cut out dairy? Pfft.
Recycle? Not enough.
Using less plastic? 
Charity shopping? Not enough.
Eating less meat? Ha. 
Cruelty free? Nice try.
No palm oil? Not enough.
6620 2018-11-21 18:06:01 So it's okay for Saudi Arabia to kill a journalist living and working in the United States because they don't like what he says. Sacrificing a life for lower oil prices! That's not what this country is about! You have turned us into a Banana Republic!
6621 2018-11-21 18:05:56 think you mean oil and we get very little of our oil from them, most of it we get from Canada. Oh and there is no "100 billion arms deal" with SA either. If you're keeping score Putin, Un and now MBS have all played our "leader" like a fiddle
6622 2018-11-21 18:05:56 I’ll take the cheap oil. Arabs killing Arabs has been going on for thousands of years. I, for one, don’t want to get involved .
6623 2018-11-21 18:05:55 You been cheating on your mans. Unbeknown to you he finds out let’s his Feels take the wheel! You go out come home and he has burnt/thrown out all your hair products. From your tail comb to your weave. Everything!!!!! Not even the JBC oil survived
6624 2018-11-21 18:05:52 $USO 11p 11/23 at $.01 right now and 11p 11/30 at $.13 fyi #oil
6625 2018-11-21 18:05:46 If someone isn’t singing/whistling while I get my oil changed, I will take my business elsewhere 
6626 2018-11-21 18:05:44 the price is very very high. M.oil reached Rs. 125/Ltr  from 95/ltr in less than a year.  Price are marginally less than the price of other brands. They don't have Cost Based Formula.
6627 2018-11-21 18:05:43 @DrAishaAlSarihi and Dubai never been really an “oil” town (as no oil there), regional trade, especially with Iran, always been its key activity explaining the local mix of population. The recent modern years Dubai tried to copy paste the Singapore model, not sure they succeeded
6628 2018-11-21 18:05:43 Not the real reason. CNN Sept 2018--US unseats Russia and Saudi Arabia as No 1 oil producer...
6629 2018-11-21 18:05:41 Also palm oil is actually the best for the environment compared with other oils.
6630 2018-11-21 18:05:34 ... and is lobbying OPEC members to match their own large cut in oil production starting in December. Almost like they want to make a point to Trump.
6631 2018-11-21 18:05:29 We have enough oil to supply much of demand in the world if we choose to access it. He’s in the Saudi’s pockets & using idiotic talking points 2 explain things 2 his cult base. He doesn’t understands world economics, he’s stupid. That’s why he laundered $ for a living!
6632 2018-11-21 18:05:23 Firstly, we have a larger oil reserve then Saudi Arabia (we dont need blood fuel!) Second, You are a joke of a human being and are only promoting the Saudis to line your pockets! Hell has a special place for you!
6633 2018-11-21 18:05:22 Our oil comes from Canada not SA, you dope!
6634 2018-11-21 18:05:19 precious metals yes....there's a lot of healing to do in oil now i think
6635 2018-11-21 18:05:17 What a tragedy to the people of Canada and the great country of Canada to lose Encana! Now you are going to lose all the hard working Canadians that work for Independent Oil and Gas Companies!! Build Pipelines Canada!!!
6636 2018-11-21 18:05:14 Please tell be @JoyVBehar how oil prices don’t affect all Americans? #TheView
6637 2018-11-21 18:05:09 Oil will be dead money over the next 2 years, as President Trump hits the campaign trail. In 2021 though, look out, all bets are off.
6638 2018-11-21 18:05:06 I just drove by Lucas Oil, saw a tent in the parking lot...must be Phillip Walker.   #Colts #ColtsNation
6639 2018-11-21 18:05:06 A woman in Tesco is currently fulfilling her small daughter’s wish to “find chocolate without palm oil in it”, which is just a nice thing to overhear really @IcelandFoods @Greenpeace
6640 2018-11-21 18:05:04 OK he cuts Saudi off Gas goes up to 10 dollars a gallon The people who are employed building the defense items all get laid off Saudis buy the items from China China builds a Armed forces base there And so does Russia as they will get with the Saudis on Oil prices are you dead
6641 2018-11-21 18:04:57 Saudi Arabia produces just a fraction of US oil imports!  We get most our OIL from ourselves, Mexico and Canada.   Donald Trump continues to degrade liberty and democracy in the name of personal illegal business he has with the Kingdom. America is declining because of him.
6642 2018-11-21 18:04:57 I would do the whole "OIL" thing but the truth is we could be a good bit less dependent on them and I still think most administration higher ups of the past decades wouldn't really care.
6643 2018-11-21 18:04:55 Jim, what you guys are missing here is the capability of Saudi as swing producer.  Can you imagine someone pissing off Saudi Arabia now and we decide to cut our production by 100k barrels "only" , what will happen when the oil market "smell" that news?
6644 2018-11-21 18:04:55 Green pepper 
Red ball pepper 
Onions 
Groundnut oil 
Fried turkey 
Seasoning
6645 2018-11-21 18:04:53 I agree with Behar. Trump is letting the Saudis slide because of another reason.  Not oil.
6646 2018-11-21 18:04:52 Baker Hughes Rig Count: U.S. -3 to 1,079 rigs: U.S. Rig Count is down 3 rigs from last week to 1,079, with oil rigs down 3 to 885 and gas rigs unchanged at 194.

U.S. Rig Count is up 156 rigs from last year's count of 923, with oil rigs up 138 and gas rigs up 18.
6647 2018-11-21 18:04:50 We aren’t dependent on foreign oil, we have enough here. Saudi Arabia has no nuclear weapons, so why do we need to ally with them?
6648 2018-11-21 18:04:50 They still do. Saudi Arabia is THE largest oil export country in the world.
6649 2018-11-21 18:04:44 I wouldn’t be suprised If Saudi opens the taps for Trumps MBS support. This will crush oil prices with more Russian pain.
6650 2018-11-21 18:04:41 Most of US oil imports comes from your neighbour Canada or had you forgotten that fact!  Numpty Trump
6651 2018-11-21 18:04:39 And it wasn't 82 bucks a barrel either, he's a fucking moron. We only get 9% of our oil from SA and we don't need that from them because CA or MX can pick up the slack.
6652 2018-11-21 18:04:35 but....I thought we weren't dependent on them for oil and we were now one of the top exporters? Are you saying that they still have leverage?
6653 2018-11-21 18:04:34 OIL RIGS DECLINE BY 3 TO 885 $CL_F $USO $SPY $ES_F
6654 2018-11-21 18:04:34 Hmmm more like reaction to ZAR + Oil capitulation ... Oh and some idiot did risk in 200k shares 30 mins before close and panicked. Foreigners just addressing underweights along with sheep locals.
6655 2018-11-21 18:04:33 The price of oil has dropped like a rock....prices at the pump have stayed the same !!!
6656 2018-11-21 18:04:33 Per CNN Sept 2018---- US is No 1 oil producer over Russia and Saudi Arabia
6657 2018-11-21 18:04:32 #OOTT | US Baker Hughes Rig Count 23-Nov: 1079 (prev 1082)

6658 2018-11-21 18:04:30 Trump claims that he maintains his relationship with Saudi Arabia because of oil prices and keeping those prices down, however I am paying four dollars a gallon at the pump for diesel? Like usual you’re doing something wrong douche bag. #whinylittlebitch
6659 2018-11-21 18:04:28 I’m getting an oil change at jiffy lube and in the service I bought it says vacuum included. These dudes think they can take advantage of a young woman and get away with not vacuuming. I think not!!!!!
6660 2018-11-21 18:04:28 The United States needs to reduce its reliance on foreign oil so that we are not put in the position of cowtowing to regimes that would put out a “ hit” on a journalist who disagreed with them.
6661 2018-11-21 18:04:18 So if you allow them to kill more journalists do we oil for free? Is that what it takes? Now you are exchanging lives for oil?
6662 2018-11-21 18:04:15 TRUMP SAYS TO SAUDI ARABIA,  "LET OIL FLOW, IN A FLOOD,  'CAUSE OIL IS SO MUCH THICKER,  THAN A REPORTER'S BLOOD"!
6663 2018-11-21 18:04:13 Yea I know that part XD
I meant like, bc my drawing tablet has different pen types including oil paint, watercolor and indian paint. And this drawing kinda looks like it’s been done with paints so I was wondering if you used paint and if you did then what kind :P
6664 2018-11-21 18:04:09 There are electric vehicle charging systems across the country right now, & in BC alone, car dealers can't get enough electric powered vehicles fast enough to meet the demand. There's only one family in Cda buying "Saudi" oil. The Irvings. We need to move out of the dino age.
6665 2018-11-21 18:04:05 In our country (PH) we don't put salt nor oil in our rice. We just rinse them of with water... then in pot or kaldero we measure the exact amount of water by our fingers. You have to put you finger on the surface of the rice and level the water with the first line of ur finger.
6666 2018-11-21 18:04:01 Blood oil
6667 2018-11-21 18:03:57 We've been turning the other cheek forever regarding the Saudis. Women's rights, beheadings, religious intolerance, anti-Israel, Yemen, etc. Oil, money, military bases, equipment purchases, opposition to Iran always have trumped hypocritical moral outrage. Just another example.
6668 2018-11-21 18:03:49 It’s time to shut the tap on discounted oil to the US.  Fair market or nothing, giving Trump hundreds of millions in discount has to stop.
6669 2018-11-21 18:03:46 Damn see I’d be hot lol idk nothing about cars but oil and brake changes so when shit get technical like that I’ll throw the whole car away for real. But they are so pretty. 
6670 2018-11-21 18:03:45 I don't know, maybe build some Oil Refineries  in Canada?!

6673 2018-11-21 18:03:38 Ok, so why the praise from Trump about gas prices the day after he declines to hold MBS responsible for Khashoggi's murder?  Does he just enjoy antagonizing those of us who care about human life more than Saudi oil profits or low gas prices?  Our anguish is his entertainment.
6674 2018-11-21 18:03:37 to be fair the CBC tweeted that US gets 40% of their oil from Canada and 11% from Saudi Arabia.
6675 2018-11-21 18:03:35 Gosh golly, who can tell, right? As Trump says, maybe he did and maybe he didn't. Heck it's just murder! As it says in the Bible: blood for oil is fine.
6676 2018-11-21 18:03:33 Red currant jelly is amazing on meat! But Chili oil is great on curry... Hmm which one is the best..?
6677 2018-11-21 18:03:28 Oil is used in over 6000 everyday household items, only 16% of each barrel is used for fuel. It will be a long time before we stop using oil so why shouldn't Scotland make the best of it?
6678 2018-11-21 18:03:25 @Swiftie01 Some in the oil patch are beginning to use the term "treasonous"(referring to the way Federal Liberals have handled it)

6681 2018-11-21 18:03:15 Canada sends 40% of the oil the USA imports. Saudis just 11% thank us! Lol so out of touch!
6682 2018-11-21 18:03:14 I drive electric and have solar. I don’t give a fuck about low oil prices. Murderer by association.
6683 2018-11-21 18:03:11 So low that oil companies in AMERICA stop production because they can't compete,so more jobs are lost. Oh, how's the tariffs working out for American companies?
6684 2018-11-21 18:03:08 We import far more oil from Canada than we do from the Persian Gulf.
6685 2018-11-21 18:03:07 Spence says his instructions were to remove the fuses and battery from the minivan and drain the fluids, including oil. He says he was comfortable doing these tasks. #nscourt

6687 2018-11-21 18:02:57 Wouldnt bother me if oil was 300.00 dollars a barrel when the price is low .Here where I live e in Louisiana we suffer people loose homes and jobs !!!
6688 2018-11-21 18:02:57 Gerrymandering, another brilliant Democrat idea which both parties have used since 1812.
Democrats never complained about it when they ruled the South and wore white hoods, it was all good.
6689 2018-11-21 18:02:52 trying not to get my motor oil stained hands on my knitting yarn
is this a mood?
6690 2018-11-21 18:02:47 #fakenews Canada provides most of the oil. Stop making up your own news. And most of us would still rather pay a bit more at the pump as opposed to condoning murder. Big difference between you and people with morals.
6691 2018-11-21 18:02:46 Wouldn’t read too much into it. Russia still totally oil export dependent (a lot to China). China Econ  definitely hitting a rough spot. More sanctions coming from west to Russia. I think they are just hunkering down as best they can for the oncoming “winter”.
6692 2018-11-21 18:02:42 Thank you! I been looking into fish oil pills I heard a lot of good things about them
6693 2018-11-21 18:02:41 i get the crispiness by just cooking on high heat in the oven and a generous coating of olive oil. tossing the crisped sprouts in oil AFTER doesn't let the vinegar sink in as well, but it definitely ensures that acidic bite at the end
6694 2018-11-21 18:02:41 Oil prices are low because there is a ‘glut’! NOT because of YOU!!
6695 2018-11-21 18:02:40 Oil prices are down because demand is low, and that’s due to the economy slowing down. I guess you missed simple macroeconomics when you went to Wharton.
6696 2018-11-21 18:02:40 Add rising tech competitiveness all around this market, i.e rising significance of bio-polymer and bioplastics production. Oil will live, it will just not be monopoly. I guess we could call it 'sustainable oil production'.
6697 2018-11-21 18:02:36 Lmao aye check this out 
Get you a spray bottle with some water and conditioner and you'll be set add a lil mint oil too
6698 2018-11-21 18:02:36 And, to be clear, they supply around 40% of our imported, but not 40% of our oil overall.  And the Saudis might supply 11% of our imported oil, but that accounts for only around 8% of our oil overall.  Our own domestic production supplies almost 40% of our total oil.
6699 2018-11-21 18:02:33 Okay, I'm caramel

6702 2018-11-21 18:02:21 And per Jim Sciotto this morning- US is biggest producer of oil. AND Sept 2018 per money.cnn America unseats Russia, Saudi Arabia as No.1 oil producer---

6705 2018-11-21 18:02:16 The oil demand is bigger than just the US. The supply in the US is helpful. However, oil is a business, extreme volatility in the sector hurts American oil producers. 

When they hurt, Americans hurt, then oil prices get hurt too. 

Stable prices are better than freefall
6706 2018-11-21 18:02:11 How many of us would want to trade lower oil prices for the brutal murder of a father of 2 sons?  
Only a morally bankrupt person like Trump could exploit this horrendous crime.
Congress you need to block arms deal, we don’t need their money.
6707 2018-11-21 18:02:03 Let’s start an XPRIZE for a system that can convert the weight of cars and trucks into electrical power and transmit it wirelessly in charging lanes #end_oil_addiction
6708 2018-11-21 18:02:03 Of course there's oil off the west coast. M.O.D admitted they had vetoed exploration in the early 80s so as not to interfere with submarine operations.
6709 2018-11-21 18:01:53 Cheap Oil is nice, but I'ld rather see some sanctions on Saudi Arabia until they put MBS in jail.

6719 2018-11-21 18:01:41 Hey @VivaNaturals did you change the formula/recipe on your krill oil capsules. New ones are much more fishy tasting IMO.
6720 2018-11-21 18:01:40 Better yet, let's get OFF of OIL and then the middle east will be less relevant!
6721 2018-11-21 18:01:30 America is the world's biggest oil producer, so thank them for what, cutting up and dismembering an American Journalist? You are financially and morally corupt, in other words, a common criminal.
6722 2018-11-21 18:01:28 Try to Remember that for Everyday that Canada Can’t Ship Ethical Oil Someone is Making a Fortune and Canadian’s are losing that Fortune. The Daily Loss is Pegged Between 80 and 100 Million Dollars a Day. This is Fact and it’s not Funny.
6723 2018-11-21 18:01:23 As usual your clueless @realDonaldTrump. We only get 11% of our oil from Saudi. 40% comes from Canada! Stop the lying to protect your monetary interest with the crown prince!
6724 2018-11-21 18:01:21 Blood for Oil
6725 2018-11-21 18:01:17 Exactly. If it weren't for all the oppressed people, Israel, nukes and how radical Islam went from "get the west out" to "conquer everything and make a global caliphate" I'd just say screw the oil and walk away from the region. Nothing but trouble over there.
6726 2018-11-21 18:01:14 Translation: "We are willing to overlook murder & dismemberment for lower oil prices..."
6727 2018-11-21 18:01:10 There might be a huge market when oil prices are high & is used as an affordable substitute for light sweet crude. In the current & future market w. a world awash in light crude at a reasonable price  There is not much demand presently, and less in future.
6728 2018-11-21 18:01:02 Brown Sugar and olive oil make a paste ,exfoliate with it.
6729 2018-11-21 18:01:02 A lot of idiots are not thinking, just using their emotions on this.. We are a country that is addicted to using oil. From transportation, heating, cooking, growing & harvesting food, to electricity for lighting, computers & phones. Without oil, we will be in the Dark Ages
6730 2018-11-21 18:00:58 Do you even have a CLUE as to why oil prices are lower? It has nothing to do with you, which I know you wouldn't understand.
How about the stock market, that you use as a barometer of your success?  It sucks big time, Skippy.
6731 2018-11-21 18:00:58 Oil prices down due to the deal you made with them, to not press charges for killing the journalist
6732 2018-11-21 18:00:57 Money, Gold,Oil and Power , plus these Saudi’s have ties to trump that goes way to his bankruptcies days . To top it off - Kushner
6733 2018-11-21 18:00:55 Ban lobbying, not just these crooks but Saudi, Israel, Oil and Gas plus weapons manufacturers
6734 2018-11-21 18:00:54 This is not really about oil, it's about Iran versus Israel... and Saudi Arabia.  Oil is a decoy. The Spanish have a saying "lie down with dogs, get up with fleas", which describes the situation perfectly.
6735 2018-11-21 18:00:51 Hadn't Saudis lowered oil prices in exchange for us uncritically letting them murder journalists?
Why are gas prices so high? Are the Saudis not complying with the agreement? Should we threaten  them with telling them not to tastelessly chop up journalists and other critics?
6736 2018-11-21 18:00:49 At what price, if this is accurate, cheaper oil in exchange for looking the other way for MURDER? Money isn't everything, you know. Justice, fairness, and not being okay with murder are priceless. You truly seem to lack a sense of decency.
6737 2018-11-21 18:00:48 Those damn trees get in the way of the oil rigs.

6742 2018-11-21 18:00:35 The Left wing Democrats need oil as high as possible to get people to buy their overpriced green energy.
6743 2018-11-21 18:00:35 @Acosta   Good grief!  Your tweet is a non sequitur...  

World oil prices are based on world oil supply and not based on how much the USA imports or from where.
6744 2018-11-21 18:00:31 In the past we relied on Saudi Oil. Today we don’t. Attributing change based on your lack of understanding is dangerous. You refusing to learn the facts is both lazy and arrogant. Your long held misconceptions don’t count as knowledge. You’ve got to ignore the voices in your head

6749 2018-11-21 18:00:21 Then he publicly thanks Saudi Arabia for cheap oil.
6750 2018-11-21 18:00:17 You already are! Oil still up 25% since Trump took office!
6751 2018-11-21 18:00:14 @realDonaldTrump if you want to keep your republican base in Southern Illinois engaged, enough with attempting to drive oil prices down and get your trade deal done with China to bring soybean prices back.  We survive on the farm and in the oil field.  $8 beans and $50 oil is bad
6752 2018-11-21 18:00:14 Over 85% of US consumption is domestic supplied. Global proven reserves have increased in the last decade, including the ex-Saudi UAE.

How does the math work for Saudis to scare oil higher? They’ve already floated production cuts guidance 3 times in recent 2 weeks. Didn’t work.
6753 2018-11-21 18:00:11 Yes.. : Canada (40%), Saudi Arabia (11%), Venezuela (9%), Mexico (8%), and Colombia (4%). According to the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and natural gas industry supports nine million U.S. jobs and makes up seven percent of the nation's gross domestic product.
6754 2018-11-21 18:00:10 I saw a tweet from a Canadian tv station that the US gets 40% of its oil from Canada. Hmmm shouldn’t Trump be nicer to the Canadians instead of kissing Saudi Ass?
6755 2018-11-21 18:00:09 just noticed i have oil spots on my shirt from shop.
i love that for no one.

6758 2018-11-21 18:00:05 Whether if it is a dead cat or not, well we need to wait. However the risk/reward for oil now is excellent. Buy oil and put the stop at current support at $61.7, if it jumps 20%, happy times... if it falls back to $61, well it is just a 5% drop against the recent 30% slump...

6761 2018-11-21 18:00:00 This ‘doing it for oil’ crap is an aberration. We only get about 10% of our oil from the Saudi’s, and they no longer rule the price of oil in the world. And oil is not only cheap right now, but will soon fall well below $50 a barrel.
It’s about his personal pocketbook. Period.
6762 2018-11-21 17:59:59 Not for anything but @JustinTrudeau still has LAV contract & allowing Saudi Oil at the destruction of Canada’s & AB-Sask economy while veiled threats of stopping LAV which that has zero impact economically to the Saudi’s. 
Literally the same thing Trump is doing just different
6763 2018-11-21 17:59:55 Did you thank the crown prince for murdering an American? I’ll take higher oil prices instead of doing business with a murder.
6764 2018-11-21 17:59:55 Another stat that goes against the MSM narrative
Trump isn’t America first, and is a Putin operative, yet we just became the world leader in oil production 

Damn, Vlad must be so happy his puppet Trump was elected
6765 2018-11-21 17:59:50 .@ChesCrosbie asks what assurances can you give the people of our province that preventative measures are being taken to prevent another oil spill #nlpoli
6766 2018-11-21 17:59:49 People are dumb. Was the killing wrong, yes. But what do you do when they announce that oil will be traded in Euro instead of dollar and the whole economy collapses?
6767 2018-11-21 17:59:48 1. Good one sir...but sir u privatizing the oil sectors NNPC for example will throw people out of their jobs and will increase the number of u unemployed in d society... So y not come up with another policy that will over side privatization? Bcos it will be too early for people
6768 2018-11-21 17:59:47 We don’t even need to. Our oil production is greater than Saudi Arabia. So we don’t even need to. It’s that sick.
6769 2018-11-21 17:59:44 Oil prices are not a justification of murder or terrorism.
6770 2018-11-21 17:59:43 Gas prices are dropping b/c
of reduced demand, not oil
from #SaudiArabia. Old gas
guzzlers being replaced by
much more fuel-efficient
cars, incl hybrids...despite
Trump's action to gut fuel
efficiency reqmnts for autos.
6771 2018-11-21 17:59:42 But real olive oil—should smell and taste green, bright, peppery, earthy, grassy, or any combination thereof 
6772 2018-11-21 17:59:41 Maybe if you let them murder more journalists, oil can get even cheaper!
6773 2018-11-21 17:59:41 yeah it was so miserable :( that’s great! i used any oil or lotion i could get my hands on.
6774 2018-11-21 17:59:36 I know woman, who works in an oil company with a monthly package of over N500k, while her husband is a civil servant earning N65k monthly. She is a woman of virtue who is ABSOLUTELY submissive to her husband. On the other hand, there are full time housewives, who are WAYWARD. So?
6775 2018-11-21 17:59:35 I’ve spent over 2k on my car this month  she been neglected but I got her straight.
New tires 
New radiator 
New lights 
Registration 
Oil changed 
Smog 
6776 2018-11-21 17:59:33 I will gladly pay more for gas if it means not covering up for murdered journalists.  Plus, lower oil prices mean layoffs in Houston's refineries.  So, thanks for that.  Lots of people will lose their well paying American jobs because of this.
6777 2018-11-21 17:59:33 Lower it goes - less oil revenue coming in. Deficit grows.
6778 2018-11-21 17:59:31 Canada supplies 40% of US oil.
Saudia Arabia is at about 11%.

6779 2018-11-21 17:59:30 I prefer oil from countries that aren’t run by murderous dictators.
6780 2018-11-21 17:59:25 Trump probably can calculate in a nano second by heart how many US$ 50-150 per oil barrel cost or create how many US jobs. Few can do that. I agree cheaper oil is better. But a replacement for oil is EVEN better, why don't we go to work on that subject to be FREE of all stuff?
6781 2018-11-21 17:59:23 1- what made trump possible? 1) constant corruption where both dems and r's take corporate money IE oil, pharma and defense 2) bc of said money dems stopped being people party and became corporate dems that use social issues to get elected while hurting middle class 3) when obama
6782 2018-11-21 17:59:19 with Iran's oil coming off the market, it's not going to be a gentle uptick.
6783 2018-11-21 17:59:16 Yep. 
And oil production in the US over the last few years has doubled while demand has declined. Their prices are falling. Their profits are taking a hit. That really pisses off malignant capitalists.
6784 2018-11-21 17:59:15 Oil is up 2.00 today, were, exactly is my tax cut?
6785 2018-11-21 17:59:12 I make vegan moisturizer :) apricot oil and a blend of essential oils. I tweak the recipe for each of my clients specific skincare needs 
6786 2018-11-21 17:59:12 Thank you Saudi Arabia?  No. First I thought US oil reserves were in a surplus and second don't we get most of our oil from our neighbors to the north?
6787 2018-11-21 17:59:09 Lmao that’s why your keeping Saudi Arabia your ally it’s all about oil shame ppl lose there lives for oil
6788 2018-11-21 17:59:09 No.  That is not it.  Oil supply from SA is negligible.  They are set by opec nations and determined by supply and demand.  SA is not the arbitrator. 

40% of US oil, in fact, comes from Canada.  Facts matter.

Trump is benefiting from relationship w/ SA; not America.
6789 2018-11-21 17:59:03 We produce more oil than any other country. Saudi Arabia supplies only about 11% of our oil. Saudi Arabia needs the US more than than the US needs Saudi Arabia. Trump publicly said the Saudis spend a lot of $ on Trump businesses. It’s on tape.
6790 2018-11-21 17:59:03 You do know what happens when oil gets too cheap...right?  Or, do you ignore that knowledge as well?
6791 2018-11-21 17:59:03 nooooooo we can't stop sucking the oil out of the ground and burning it into the air!!!! bad for business!!!
6792 2018-11-21 17:59:00 Welcome to the oil field where they drive bulldozers to the burrito shop
6793 2018-11-21 17:58:54 คือถ้าฟังดีๆ ทุกคนอะเสียงดี ร้องเพลงเป็น แต่ที่เลิกฟังเพราะพอทุกคนมาร้องด้วยกันมันเลยไม่เพราะ และทำนองเพลงก็ไม่โอเคอะ ไม่ติดหูเลย
6794 2018-11-21 17:58:52 By the way, Canada supplies 40% of USA oil, while Saudi Arabia supplies 11%. Yet, he disrespects our PM regularly and “stands with” SA. Murder+dismemberment being overlooked. This is very bad for the USA. I would not want to be an American journalist right now. 
6795 2018-11-21 17:58:50 For OIL @tedlieu for oil. $$$
6796 2018-11-21 17:58:49 Crude Oil Spot Price January 2017 was $50, today it is $76.  Once again, another Trump fabrication. #drainthetrump
6797 2018-11-21 17:58:48 Gas prices... if oil costs less, the price tends to go down, therefore we pay less for said gas. Where am I going wrong here?
6798 2018-11-21 17:58:44 @rdmJerry, its not for people, its for oil tankers.
6799 2018-11-21 17:58:41 You missed the point, we are producing more to curb Iran oil production. More production, lower price.
 
6800 2018-11-21 17:58:31 Canadian oil is $40 but comes with a price: legal weed and Kinder Surprise Eggs.

6803 2018-11-21 17:58:21 Letting the murder of a journalist go unpunished lowered our oil prices... can’t help thinking that murder was involved for this to happen, @realDonaldTrump
6804 2018-11-21 17:58:12 What you say will not change the same formula that Saudi Arabia dominates the oil market ..
6805 2018-11-21 17:57:59 I'm no expert, but I don't believe the U.S. needs them, but prefers having them not only for oil, and not only to sell arms to, but also to have a "friend" in the middle east. Mostly to line the pockets of those in the oil industry.
6806 2018-11-21 17:57:57 Saudi’s Arabia and Russia slowed production of oil to raise the cost. America is no longer dependant on them for oil as we produce our own now... so what has the Saudi’s done for us?
6807 2018-11-21 17:57:49 The painful reality is we've been Saudi Arabia's bitch since oil was discovered there a century ago. Trump is an unprincipled coward whose sole motivation in life is enriching himself and his crooked cronies. But no US president has stood up to the House of Saud in my lifetime.
6808 2018-11-21 17:57:42 Approx. 40% of oil imported to the US comes from Canada, where's your appreciation for them?

Whatever you think of @JustinTrudeau, everyone can agree he doesn't order the murder of journalists.

6810 2018-11-21 17:57:29 Lol only white Christian religions. And a select few Islamic states like Saudi because of the oil and $ from weapons sold to kill us by terrorism. Oil and $ trumps religion and morals. Lol always

6812 2018-11-21 17:57:29 I live on the island of Newfoundland and I am so angry at what has happened off our shores. Oil covered birds have been rescued from the spill, but we know that is just the beginning. Oil needs to stay in the ground.
6813 2018-11-21 17:57:21 Saudi Arabia controls the price of that Canadian oil
6814 2018-11-21 17:57:19 Know who really hurts when oil prices drop? The Americans who also produce it.
6815 2018-11-21 17:57:16 Unfortunately Turkey is right, Trump has disavowed the murder in favor of Saudi money and oil. 
The current POTUS has disgraced the office of the Presidency over and over, and this takes the cake.
With apologies to Turkey and the family of the murdered reporter we are sorry...
6816 2018-11-21 17:57:15 Oh unknowledgeable one. #Khashaggi was a Saudi national with terrorist ties who was killed in a Turkish Embassy. His death is no concern of US. There is no reason for high oil prices, billions of dollars in trade to be lost, American jobs & Israel’s security lost over his death.
6817 2018-11-21 17:57:09 Duh  
No matter where we buy oil we have to do that  

I gave stats on where we buy oil, you said fake news, I told where I got the stat & gave a link, and you changed the subject. Again, nice try but you have done absolutely nothing to prove your fake "fake news" claim.
6818 2018-11-21 17:57:06 And sell us a shitload of oil. As much as they aren't THE reason oil is cheap they do keep the price depressed.
6819 2018-11-21 17:57:05 Using Saudi oil with matches provided by Donald Trump.
6820 2018-11-21 17:57:05 you cant go any lower than this. Trying to sell our souls to Saudis for few penny discount on oil prices .... truly disgusting! but what else to expect from you right?!....
6821 2018-11-21 17:57:01 So our Idiot in Chief thought it was just fine to insult our ally the Canadians where we get almost half our oil, but not ok with the Saudis where he probably got half his loans
6822 2018-11-21 17:57:00 Trump Just Can't Tell The Truth...  Sweet Crude was $ 84 a Barrel-----Down to $ 64... Sour Crude Was  $75 a Barrel ----- Down to $ 57 a Barrel.. Obama Left Office with

6829 2018-11-21 17:56:46 That’s stupid it’s a commodity if they cut oil production it would affect the price per barrel of oil and drive up the cost for everyone. This is #fakenews towards @realDonaldTrump. My small business depends on gas prices to transport and I appreciate it under 3.00!
6830 2018-11-21 17:56:43 I thought USA (companies) was producing oil and benefitting from high prices.
6831 2018-11-21 17:56:40 The lower oil prices also hurt the energy industry and those who work in that industry.
6832 2018-11-21 17:56:38 Obama blocked arms sales to Nigeria.  USA military men sent here to train us messed up our soldiers and later blamed them.  He stopped buying our oil.  Should I go on.
6833 2018-11-21 17:56:33 Simple! Maduro wants to get rid of the dollar to trade oil. He also banned Rothschild banks from operating in the country. The same case goes with Iran. The only South American that's not the USA vassal

6842 2018-11-21 17:56:06 Didn't anyone tell him that the US is now a bigger oil producer then Saudi Arabia?  So I suppose that means he should be thanking himself.  Surprised he didn't jump at the chance.
6843 2018-11-21 17:56:00 Given our shale product, going lower will kill American oil production. You and Kudlow are a real pair of idiots. Price drops echo world slowdown.

6851 2018-11-21 17:55:46 So you took a bribe. You agreed not hold Saudi Arabia accountable for a gruesome brutal execution of an innocent human being and they’ll lower oil barrel prices. You are a sick and twisted individual.
6852 2018-11-21 17:55:46 So dumb that he doesn’t know Americans make more oil !
6853 2018-11-21 17:55:43 Still selling the snake oil of ‘brave new trade deals’ absolute horse shit.
6854 2018-11-21 17:55:40 The Americans now have control over oil within or flowing through the Ukraine as well as its immense forestry resources.
6855 2018-11-21 17:55:37 Today's +3% jump even with unexpected stock build is pretty telling. When oil reversed from $85 down to current levels it was the opposite play: inventory draw, yet oil prices slumped strongly
The key will be Friday's close. A sustained reverse following today will motivate specs
6856 2018-11-21 17:55:33 We need to get him involved in next year's oil price bet, no?
6857 2018-11-21 17:55:32 I know I say some fucked upmthings when I'm drunk and thismwas one of them. I don't know why I felt compelled to thank Saudi Arabia for the tit for tat since them dropping oil prices was THEM thanking ME for turning a blind eye to murde.

6859 2018-11-21 17:55:29 I don’t think anything other than true utility will provide any meaningful and sustainable increase. Would you want to invest in a commodity which has only speculative purposes and no real value. Would you buy oil if there was no one to refine it? To use it to the fullest?

6862 2018-11-21 17:55:21 Agree! There have always been a selfish motive on our leaders part-personal interests, arms deals, oil, strategic interest in the region, etc. None of them are justifiable when we as a nation want to stand up for human rights.

6866 2018-11-21 17:55:08 Sana oil 
6867 2018-11-21 17:55:07 Saudi Arabia is running the world and global economy buy controlling oil prices. And Saudi Arabia has the biggest company of oil in the world.We can get down the American economy buy one order from the Saudi king and MBS. 
6868 2018-11-21 17:55:05 Numerous variables! The candidate who made school choice a central plank of his platform wasn’t seen as a school choice advocate! Up is down! Night is day! Tuna oil makes an excellent shark repellent!
6869 2018-11-21 17:55:03 I'll keep you in mind the next time I buy a barrel of oil.
6870 2018-11-21 17:55:02 And btw #PresidentIgnoramus, the US gets 4x as much oil from Canada (44%) as from Saudis (11%). Your silly tariffs (a TAX on American consumers) have a bigger impact than Saudi oil prices
6871 2018-11-21 17:55:02 sometimes i really wish someone i love & respect would disintegrate me, and use my dust & bones in a variety of arts & crafts projects, including but not limited to sculpture & oil painting. would not mind becoming printer ink and printing out dragon ball z fanfics either.
6872 2018-11-21 17:55:01 If the US invested in solar & wind power & EVs the way we invested in the mission to the moon, we'd never need the Saudi's or anyone else's blood oil ever again, & we could properly tell them all to go fuck themselves as their oil became worth about as much as their fucking sand.
6873 2018-11-21 17:55:00 The only thing the Saudi Prince has is oil. Oil gives him money to bribe our president and buy our senators. Imagine a sustainable world where Saudi Arabia meant nothing, like it did before.
6874 2018-11-21 17:54:46 Don't think the Saudis can go much lower than they already have.  

Oh you mean oil. You know they aren't our major supplier, right? And that they already raised prices in response to this tweet? 

So much winning, it burns. 
6875 2018-11-21 17:54:46 ****Oil is still up 25% since Trump took office****
"Tax cut"? My ass!
6876 2018-11-21 17:54:46 There is another downfall to lowering oil prices. Oil companies start laying off people
6877 2018-11-21 17:54:39 Why he doesn’t self praise about the stock market anymore?  Oh... forgot the market was down lately... smart Donald always win as market and oil up, he did a great job for stocks, when market and oil down, he did a great job for an oil tax cut... well done!
6878 2018-11-21 17:54:28 Yes thank you to Saudi Arabia, with all this maniac propaganda they could raise oil prices to the top
6879 2018-11-21 17:54:26 The president just loves Saudi Arabia
Oil prices getting lower. Great! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World. Enjoy! $54, was just $82. Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let’s go lower!
—@realDonaldTrump
6880 2018-11-21 17:54:23 We also want to rid the Saudis of their oil to destabilize them. By using there's we'll be left with large reserves while they are future less... Or so the conspiracy theory says.
6881 2018-11-21 17:54:22 I’ve generally gone apple cider and olive oil. I like the sprout to bite back a bit but those all sound amazing. When did people decide to actually prepare them in a way that isn’t terrible?
6882 2018-11-21 17:54:16 @realDonaldTrump 
Please explain why it’s easier buying oil from the Middle East than Canadian oil?Are we not a safer,more ethical and reliable option? @FoxNews @CNN @CBCNews It just doesn’t make sense unless you’re part of the elite establishment you speak of. #ChangeIsPossible
6883 2018-11-21 17:54:07 So the CBC says the Saudis only provide 11% of our imported oil while Canada provides 40%. Maybe he should be thanking Justin Trudeau?
6884 2018-11-21 17:54:05 Some things are more important than the price of oil. Like not selling out your country, or your countrymen. Like human life. Like dignity.
6885 2018-11-21 17:54:01 I'm guessing he doesn't know that America and Russia produce more oil than Saudi
6886 2018-11-21 17:53:55 I'm sure trump will claim he made the oil deal with the Saudis..  No they showed u who runs the world
6887 2018-11-21 17:53:55 Total mind bender that we have a #POTUS who makes deals w/murderers and despots, saddles #US w/debt that could end up crippling any real expansion, uses our military as “props” for his power image photo ops to the dictators he’s trying to impress & lauds an oil crash as “great.”
6888 2018-11-21 17:53:55 Trump Alchemy: Turning blood into oil.
6889 2018-11-21 17:53:54 Yes, let's piss off a country that we have an oil trade with over one person(harsh but millions of people affected over one person). Sounds great  Sanctions, yes to an extent.
6890 2018-11-21 17:53:53 It's called "how to limit the scrutiny of your in-house murders" - just pump the hell out of those oil wells.
6891 2018-11-21 17:53:51 You couldn’t possibly go lower after ignoring cold blooded murder for the price of oil
6892 2018-11-21 17:53:49 Like you tell them what price to charge for oil.
6893 2018-11-21 17:53:48 Let's just choose electric and say screw the oil industry altogether;)
6894 2018-11-21 17:53:47 I commend you @RandPaul for standing up to POTUS on this issue. We can't say that we're a beacon of freedom when we support countries with intentional human rights abuses. It's time to findan oil alternative. We should have learned from the oil embargoes of the 70's, but didn't.
6895 2018-11-21 17:53:42 So does that mean you *can't* ship me 11 oil filters?
6896 2018-11-21 17:53:39 You’re thanking Saudi Arabia for low US oil prices when they provide only 11% of your imported oil?? Guess who is the largest supplier of US imported oil at 40%? Your northern ally who you consider a national security threat - remember steel tariffs. Spare me the BS. #FactsMatter
6897 2018-11-21 17:53:37 Funny how the oil prices went down 34% and the gas pump price average only went down 8%. Who's this "tax cut" for again? #NotWorthaJournalistsMurder
6898 2018-11-21 17:53:37 Saudi’s cut production, so prices should be even lower. Part of the reason for lower prices is the interest rate are increasing making the dollar higher. Since oil is pegged in dollars prices decline with higher dollar. Trump doesn’t know that tho lmao
6899 2018-11-21 17:53:36 Oil is highly manipulated commodity, ipo delayed so prices down or Trump wants it that way
6900 2018-11-21 17:53:35 Saudi Arabia only provides 11% of imported US oil,
Canada provides 40%  so, you're welcome Don, Putz!
6901 2018-11-21 17:53:34 The OECD said growth had likely peaked at 3.7% and expects it to slow to 3.5% in 2019 and 2020.  It still expects relative ease for the global economy in coming years but warned trade barriers, outflows from developing economies and higher oil prices could push it off track. .
6902 2018-11-21 17:53:31 Ny Norwegian timeline has been flooded with the same industry the last weeks.

The Norwegian Oil and Gas Association is claiming petroleum is the cause for increased living standards in Norway since 1970, and Equinor is boasting about being green and concerned about the future.
6903 2018-11-21 17:53:25 He'll wont have hearings about Ivanka's emails b/c her father will purge him from the inner circle. Plus the hearings will expose his role in taking Russian oil money as well as connect the dots to other corrupt GOP members.
6904 2018-11-21 17:53:25 I wonder how swiftly American & British politicians would withdraw their support for #SaudiArabia if the oil suddenly dried up? Faster than a tory invite to a Rupert Murdoch party I'd imagine.
6905 2018-11-21 17:53:25 Ask him why we sell oil for $14 and buy oil from Saudi oil tankers rolling up the St. Lawrence to Quebec refineries.Ask him why we have over 800k kilometers of pipeline and can't build more.Ask him if any other country is this stupid.
6906 2018-11-21 17:53:24 Hey but at least we get 11% of the oil cheaper .Yea us Lol
6907 2018-11-21 17:53:22 It has nothing to do with oil prices. That is just another lie from the sociopath in the WH.
6908 2018-11-21 17:53:19 Took my car in for an oil change and they told me my brakes were 95% worn down. Looks like I’m getting new brake pads for Christmas   
6909 2018-11-21 17:53:18 Lower oil prices are due to falling global demand. Which is a sign of worse outcomes to come. 

When OPEC decides to restrict supply to boost prices, expect an potential negative reaction from the global economy. Dragging down the US economy with it.
6910 2018-11-21 17:53:16 President Trump should not be asking Saudi Arabia to lower oil prices.
He should tell Saudi Arabia he will not accept the killing of Mr. Khashoggi.
6911 2018-11-21 17:53:14 This isn’t the 1970s. We get under 10 percent of our oil from Saudi & wouldn’t need to buy any of we didn’t want too.
6912 2018-11-21 17:53:10 But like US is not as reliant on oil from as it was in 1970s. While I’m not sure about this one but I also think OPEC economies are not as strong as it was back in 70s. I don’t think they can afford that
6913 2018-11-21 17:53:03 can't really use the oil though, can we, climate crisis and all that, we don't need it tho, we've got loads of other stuff
6914 2018-11-21 17:53:02 He does realize of course that 40% of US oil imports are from Canada.  Only 11% from SA. Im sure he will be sending a thank you note to Justin.
6915 2018-11-21 17:52:59 แก้สามรอบก็ยังพิมพ์ตกอยุ่ ความเบลอนี้ นอนก่อยย
6916 2018-11-21 17:52:56 Saudi Arabia just took a bone saw to oil prices!
6917 2018-11-21 17:52:54 balsamic just makes them sing (thinking of roasting with some maple bacon, but that depends on my mood tomorrow). so good, too, with red wine vinegar and olive oil... the other year, spouse's aunt made this cranberry orange chili relish that MAYBE one day i'll consider...
6918 2018-11-21 17:52:43 I love love love LOVE Spectra gas station in ibex! Excellent service and friendly staff from DAY ONE! Today one of the attendants even bought me a whole litre of engine oil  I'm happy!
6919 2018-11-21 17:52:43 I better get the old Dodge dually ready this coming Saturday, oil change, etc. Ol Polar has a long drive ahead of him.
6920 2018-11-21 17:52:39 Yesterday he endorsed the murder of an American journalist by a Saudi prince without any mention of sanctions. Today he APPLAUDED the Saudis for dropping oil prices. That basically hands over American Middle East policy to a dictatorship.  So much Winning!
6921 2018-11-21 17:52:38 The steak melted in my mouth and the chicken just fell off the bone on my wings. Definitely a must have! I haven’t used any oil at all either which is a winner and it’s healthy! 
6922 2018-11-21 17:52:37 cont'd Fed would print b/c they are debt buyer of last resort. The amt to print is $1T per year. This means the USD would fall, oil prices would rise in dollars but the combo of falling USD and falling Bond value would bankrupt mideast who own 3-4 T of both dollars and bonds
6923 2018-11-21 17:52:35 The Saudi oil tweet is dumb, but protectionist posturing like what you suggest is also dumb and would hurt Americans and Canadians alike. The U.S. is the world's biggest oil producer, anyway, and would ultimately benefit more on a relative basis if Canada or others did that.
6924 2018-11-21 17:52:35 fact: Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia...so there's that...
6925 2018-11-21 17:52:33 Please learn the basics of supply and demand.  Please get your fact straights regarding oil oroduxtion.  Please tell the truth about Saudi Arabia.  Please NEVER thank them for anything - that is not who America is.  Then again America is not indebted to a barbaric regime-you are!
6926 2018-11-21 17:52:30 Letto. Che poi, certe élites, erano disponibili. Tipo De Benedetti. Cmq, sol oil fatto che tu abbia contestato lo scorfano Marattin, il signor #iosotuttoevoinonsapeteuncazzo, ti rende simpatico. Oltre che competente.
6927 2018-11-21 17:52:27 going to whole foods the day before thanksgiving for lavender food grade oil and arrowroot - low morale
6928 2018-11-21 17:52:23 Shit for Brains #Trump likely doesn't know Saudi Arabia supplies less than 10% of US' oil.
6929 2018-11-21 17:52:20 My Mum had type 2 diabetes for 20 years. She's now been completely free of diabetes for 18 months since she started taking CBD oil. Her doctors said it's close to a miracle.
6930 2018-11-21 17:52:19 Ali please correct the statement re US oil - CANADA is the biggest supplier to the US   NOT Saudi Arabia. This is important....it points to the imbalance in the president's choice of allies.
6931 2018-11-21 17:52:18 This is only the beginning... The value of life is going down, the value of oil will eventually overtake it... @realDonaldTrump
6932 2018-11-21 17:52:17 Right after he told Saudi Arabia it's ok to KILL Reporter as long as they keep oil prices low and they stay at @realDonaldTrump properties and donate money for his re-election. He is slapping Murders on the wrist   and selling Americans down the river
6933 2018-11-21 17:52:16 but they're pushing for all palm oil to be farmed responsibly
they're not just going to get one that is and move on
it's about drawing attention to the problem and getting it fixed
6934 2018-11-21 17:52:11 Justifying premeditated murder of a journalist with lower oil costs, just another day at the office for Donnie.
6935 2018-11-21 17:52:09 And this from @CBCnewsalerts Also, Saudi Arabia has sought to boost oil prices by promising to pump fewer barrels in December. A week ago, it backed a proposal for OPEC nations to cut production by one million barrels per day.
6936 2018-11-21 17:52:09 @realDonaldTrump Tax Cut = yuge failure; Repugs couldn't even run on it.  Oil coming down has nothing to do with you and your failing, flailing policies.  Crooks don't do well in the oil market.  And yet you gave waivers to Iran???
6937 2018-11-21 17:52:05 These people are the new carpetbaggers and snake oil sales people. Imagine paying good money for this bs? You couldn't PAY me to sit through this nonsense.
6938 2018-11-21 17:52:04 Some of us are living off the oil and gas money we get off our property......your killing us little people....please stop
6939 2018-11-21 17:52:02 It’s not the oil change that’s the issue, it was the “SURPRISE your breaks are totally fucked and dangerous to drive with” problem. And if I hadn’t gone to a shop to get the oil change; I’d have never known. Normally I’d say “Yes, DIY!” But in this case I’m glad I went to a shop
6940 2018-11-21 17:52:02 You ignore the difficulty in bringing, proving these cases and the expense involved. The nature of them is why more are not pursued.
Lack of proof something happened is not proof it didnt happen
6941 2018-11-21 17:51:55 Do you realize if the price of oil falls too low the US producers will cut production... lowering the supply... raising the price.
6942 2018-11-21 17:51:50 How come you don't thank Canada for our cheap oil prices? Could it be because we are still a National Security Threat so you can screw us and Americans over with steel and aluminum tariffs? Maybe because we won't lend you money like Saudi does?

6944 2018-11-21 17:51:47 I need to clean my car today and get an oil change... shit
6945 2018-11-21 17:51:45 Oil is our national heroin and we’re always looking for the next fix. We’re even willing to “go to bed” with truly evil people to satisfy our blood thirst.
6946 2018-11-21 17:51:43 I wonder what this liberal train wreck would have said if Trump’s actions would have caused oil to skyrocket?  Would she have packaged it up with the outrage over tariffs?  No matter what he does, she will cry foul.
6947 2018-11-21 17:51:41 Drop the patents on Fuelcells and let people innovate. Also stop drilling for more oil (always a good idea!) and protect the environment!
6948 2018-11-21 17:51:41 What’s sad is Saudi’s Arabia isn’t bringing the cost of oil down, as a matter of fact they are doing nothing for us... the only person getting anything out of this is Trump and of course Jared. They have once again sold out our country to a foreign government for their gain.
6949 2018-11-21 17:51:37 Favourite essential oil for the winter season?
6950 2018-11-21 17:51:37 @nabisco please follow companies who are role model leaders like @benandjerrys and stop using palm oil #DropDirtyPalmOil.
6951 2018-11-21 17:51:32 2017 stats show Saudi Arabia provides 9% of oil the US imports. The drop in gas prices now is a traditional drop projected back in August. Gas prices went up 45 cents this year, so a drop as gas formulas change and demand lowers is NOT unusual and probably NOT Saudi-related.
6952 2018-11-21 17:51:28 In these days of drought, climate change, dwindling resources and pressure on wildlife and  from many sources could we please have an indigenous person in charge of the Department Of Interior instead of oil executive, coal man, or from chemical industry
6953 2018-11-21 17:51:22 Oil?!
6954 2018-11-21 17:51:21 So this is all it takes for you to approve of the murder and dismemberment of an American resident....lower oil prices? You're disgusting....all you care about is the blood money, not the immorality of looking the other way. You ought to be ashamed, but you're not, are you?
6955 2018-11-21 17:51:17 Between Rs. 90 - 95 per litre

At $63 per barrel & $ @ Rs. 135, per litre cost is Rs. 54.
Now add transportation, refinery charges, profit of oil distributors & taxes+duties of Rs. 30
6956 2018-11-21 17:51:16 11% of America's oil comes from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 40% comes from Canada. Too bad we got slapped with a steel and aluminum tariff that's still in place. (When last I checked we don't engage in state sanctioned murder... French lessons yes, but no murder.)
6957 2018-11-21 17:51:13 After my grandfather was murdered in 1931, my father said his mother had to fry the breadcrumbs in the olive oil and thats what they ate for dinner during the depression
Could you see these people doing that today?
I dont think so!
They are spoiled!
#shameful
6958 2018-11-21 17:51:11 Via @CBCnewsalerts Donald Trump has just tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to 'a big Tax Cut for America and the World!' In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
6959 2018-11-21 17:51:09 I am ill with POTUS groveling over Saudi, this is contrary to every important value the USA is based on. Do you think the lower oil prices is blood money.
6960 2018-11-21 17:51:09 Blood oil
6961 2018-11-21 17:51:07 I done came down lil rusty slide me some oil no tin man
6962 2018-11-21 17:51:04 News flash genius: we’ll always sell out to SA because of our needs for oil. It runs our country.
6963 2018-11-21 17:51:04 At that rate, why not sacrifice two more journalists and the oil will be free. #trumpmath
6964 2018-11-21 17:51:03 Haha, I wasn’t saying the above because I was ridiculing energy.  It was because I was buying and have been buying.  Even bought oil the commodity itself last couple days.  Which is why it felt so brutal to me.  I have a very large skew towards commodities in my portfolio
6965 2018-11-21 17:50:56 Let’s destroy the planet, let’s destroy the planet, let’s destroy the planet... such great news, alternatively you could offer subsidies on alternative energies, or sign a deal to end the use of oil...
6966 2018-11-21 17:50:51 Sustainable palm oil exists and lots of companies use it. You don't want to accidentally condemn sustainable activities by boycotting them, that's quite counter productive. It's important to research your products and distinguish sustainable from unsustainable ones.
6967 2018-11-21 17:50:50 Guy I dey find who needs a oil servicing company, I run that now
6968 2018-11-21 17:50:45 I’m sure he has no idea where our oil comes from. Just like he has no idea how anything works.
6969 2018-11-21 17:50:43 One word. OIL!!!
6970 2018-11-21 17:50:42 We should have rejected fossil fuels years ago.  There were always viable alternatives.  The oil lobby bought dubious legislators.  We are now experiencing horrific tragedy due to greed.
6971 2018-11-21 17:50:41 The cheaper oil should start a flood of cheap oil coming into the US. This means that our domestic wells become non-profitable to run so we start losing jobs to Saudi Arabia. We go from being the world’s largest oil producer to a smaller one. Can you say oil embargo time.
6972 2018-11-21 17:50:37 He says oil, but what he means is that his company having hotels in Saudi Arabia is more important than a human life!
6973 2018-11-21 17:50:35 Mineral v. Corn oil, double-blind.

6975 2018-11-21 17:50:27 New steel mill opening in Indiana. New coal mine opened in Pennsylvania. EPA regulations cut on oil and gas wells. Many new jobs added to that. All high paying jobs. The pipeline and many other high paying jobs that Obama tried
to cut
6976 2018-11-21 17:50:27 What kind of shady, under-the-table “business” did you do for them to get them to lower oil prices? Just wondering.
6977 2018-11-21 17:50:23 @realDonaldTrump  kiss the Saudis oil goodbye.  What is wrong with our own oil wells?  There are plenty around that can be reopened .
6978 2018-11-21 17:50:23 Saudi Arabia deserves no thanks after the vicious murder of a journalist orchestrated by the Crown Prince. We need to remember that those who struck on 9/11 were Saudis. No amount of money and oil can excuse such actions.
6979 2018-11-21 17:50:22 What a freaking a##hole, he even lies about the real price of oil. Basically he condones the murder of a citizen for economic reasons. A wannabe Dictator, you gonna give them a courtesy reach around now?
6980 2018-11-21 17:50:20 No, because it’s not about oil. It’s about Trump keeping the Saudis as allies for the war he wants with Iran.
6981 2018-11-21 17:50:18 UGH maybe i should give in and learn oil paints... really wish there were a fuckin class on em around here that cost less than $250 tho
6982 2018-11-21 17:50:17 WTI is $54.  The highest it got was $74.  Brent was at $82.  Why can't you ever be honest?  And why are you trying to drive down oil prices so low that it put American producers out of business?
6983 2018-11-21 17:50:14 True that. The United States currently doesn't need to buy oil from the Saudis.  And they arent lowering the price to suit him. They may be doing it so that people will contimue to purchase the oil they are producing.
6984 2018-11-21 17:50:07 It appears you have no idea how oil prices are set.  The market is flooded with the oil right now thus lowering the price.  It is called supply and demand.  Even if they did exclusive dictate the oil price it doesn't excuse you being okay with a man being chopped to pieces.
6985 2018-11-21 17:50:03 Why did Allah give them so much oil, while most Christian countries god Nothing from Lord?
6986 2018-11-21 17:49:51 Why do you and your party is not able to brief the public on dailywise about gas price and oil price ?
6987 2018-11-21 17:49:44 It’s time to get him out. Pence is just a bad with his diluted Christian views, I believe in Christ but , their view are too extreme for most believers. His whole administration needs too GO. We need to turn this country around we Don’t deal in Treason and Blood for Oil.
6988 2018-11-21 17:49:38 The video is like oil, but the racist comment blames all, the show and their future market in CN.
6989 2018-11-21 17:49:38 You mean the system that relies on some creeps behind the mask of #Q? Or, that keep repeating the bs meme of, “fuel oil can’t melt steel”? Or, that Adrenochrome has effects no biochemist has ever found & make no sense?
I’ll keep my system, thanks!
6990 2018-11-21 17:49:37 Last thing I got was oil for my car!
6991 2018-11-21 17:49:34 Oh, that's a funny one! The only people that do not see Trump as a symbol of honesty, integrity, and power are those that are blinded by irrational hatred. Bush's press conference in response to the 2005 oil crises, "Well if you don't need gas, don't buy it."
6992 2018-11-21 17:49:30 He was a Muslim Brotherhood sympathizer, a former Saudi government propagandist and his family has had a long history of shady arms and oil deals with the regime in #Iran. He didn’t deserve to die in that horrible way to be sure but he’s no hero.
6993 2018-11-21 17:49:29 Saudi Arabia is being run by a bunch of criminals! They can keep their DAMN oil..........
6994 2018-11-21 17:49:27 I’m thinking the Saudis bought trump off with lowering oil prices. He is so easily manipulated by foreign governments. They all know he’s a fool.
6995 2018-11-21 17:49:24 Did @realDonaldTrump just sell America’s soul for lower oil prices? Cash for Khashoggi #cashforkhashoggi #disgraceful #unacceptable #disturbing #KhashoggiMurder #timefor46
6996 2018-11-21 17:49:21 คิมม่อนเป็นไง
6997 2018-11-21 17:49:19 Saudi Arabia is able to produce oil  most cheaply, sometimes under $10 a barrel while US shale oil costs somewhere between $60 to 90.
6998 2018-11-21 17:49:17 That's oil, folks!!
6999 2018-11-21 17:49:12 how does Texas, North Dakota and California's oil producing companies and citizens feel about this "tax break"?
7000 2018-11-21 17:49:11 Let's say mineral oil decreased statin absorption by half. Would that be enough to explain % RRI?

How much reduction in statin would be required to explain difference in event rate?
7001 2018-11-21 17:49:10 Each 1 Bbl of Oil sold increases the demand for the #USD and USD debt securities or bonds. Saudi invests excess $USD in US Debt (bonds). So they sell oil for USD then re-invest that USD into USA as Bonds. If they stop buying Bonds the demand for USD drops. Then Fed has to print.
7002 2018-11-21 17:49:10 オイルだって、泣きたい時もある。
7003 2018-11-21 17:49:08 Truth is more oil come from Canada than from the Saudis!  Someone is doing some gaslighting here.  Cash loans behind it, ya think?
7004 2018-11-21 17:49:01 Trump should also thank Canada for low oil prices. We are selling our oil for as low as $10 a barrel because we can’t build pipelines to either coast so we can export it to countries other than US.
7005 2018-11-21 17:49:00 ummm don't we sell oil ? America first ?
7006 2018-11-21 17:48:57 Almi Market Me Crude Oil Ki Qimaton Me Musalsal Mandi Fi Barrel Me 3 $ Ki Kami, 45 Din Me 26 $ Ki Kami, Oil $ 53.89 Sent Pr Agia
7007 2018-11-21 17:48:54 There has to be someone in the White House with some common sense to help Trump. I honestly don't think he understands what he is saying. Defense the American people.  Who gives a crap about Oil Prices with them. By the way not true that they are lower. O yea... 9-11 #neverforget
7008 2018-11-21 17:48:52 I work in the demand side. Believe it or keep your head in the oil sands, but this party is coming to an end. 10 to 40 years.
7009 2018-11-21 17:48:49 Mum: "Hi can you pick up some olive oil?"

Sure, just a small bottle or?

Mum: "One of the nice extra virgin bottles that are about £8"

*has a brain aneurysms*
7010 2018-11-21 17:48:46 American oil produces will not be 
That happy!! 
7011 2018-11-21 17:48:43 Remember when ......providers of 40%of your oil....was a great ally????
7012 2018-11-21 17:48:42 You are such a f**king moron. Canada is our biggest importer of crude and oil hasn’t been that high in over 4 years. STOP. LYING. You’re thanking murderers!! Just as bad an terroristic as Iran!! I know you’d love to kill journalists who don’t agree with you as well.
7013 2018-11-21 17:48:41 다행이야 증멜...뜬금 아포칼립스물로 다 갈아 엎어 버릴뻔 했잖아
7014 2018-11-21 17:48:37 The art of the deal?  Trump is just keeping his fingers crossed that the Saudis won’t lower oil production and thus raise prices.  He should have at least called in a chip for his morally repugnant whitewash of the brutal murder of Khashoggi by Mohammed bin Salman.
7015 2018-11-21 17:48:37 Did GEJ really say this?

Same logic with the missing $20bn  'America would have known' during one of his media chats OR 'if no one is buying the stolen crude oil they wouldn't be stealing' statement at Davos.
7016 2018-11-21 17:48:32 We import most of our oil from Canada. Why aren’t you thanking them?
7017 2018-11-21 17:48:31 Pretty sure coffee and walnut cake was good in the old days when it was just made with flour, eggs, sugar, butter, coffee, walnuts and skill. 

I neither need or expect to find palm oil in an M&S cake.
7018 2018-11-21 17:48:31 World trade suffer under high oil prices.
7019 2018-11-21 17:48:30 LOL, the Trumpers down here in O&G Land are THRILLED with falling oil prices, trade war on their crops, etc
7020 2018-11-21 17:48:27 Of all the pipeline proposals, TMX was the most risky & most likely to face people hanging from the Lion Gate Bridge blocking ships even if the pipeline was ever built. This was all orchestrated to make sure oil is locked in! The result is the US gets our resource for free
7021 2018-11-21 17:48:23 And the USA is pumping to most oil I heard. #1 right? A MAGA moment and it was blown.
7022 2018-11-21 17:48:23 Oil prices lower??? FAKE NEWS. Who care if they’re killing Americans so you can achieve your agenda.....which by the way you’re not. AMERICA DONT BE FOOLED BY THIS FOOL.
7023 2018-11-21 17:48:16 Louisianans love seafood & they love oil, they better choose seafood over oil or develop a crude taste for the stuff!
7024 2018-11-21 17:48:13 Blood for Oil!
7025 2018-11-21 17:48:12 It’s ok mate, they’re allowed to do it as long as they keep providing the West with oil...
7026 2018-11-21 17:48:12 Just look the other way while the Crown Prince kills a few more journalists - that should lower the cost of oil a dollar or two, amirite? #MAGA
7027 2018-11-21 17:48:10 I be buying the brass knuckles. The only way to tell if the oil is legit is if the air bubble in the cartridge moves slow but if it moves fast then it’s some CUT 
7028 2018-11-21 17:48:10 Oil prices are due to a glut in the market, NOT Donald Trump.   Secondly, Woodward & Bernstein always said to "follow the money".     A truer statement was never written.
7029 2018-11-21 17:48:09 There was no building upon this agreement. It was a political move 
If the funding in academia and msm were massively changed to the other spectrum (pro oil) would we be having this discussion?
People would still be fighting about incomplete and fudged data sets maybe. Thats it.
7030 2018-11-21 17:48:09 Well, yeah. He provides them with arms and in exchange they ensure that the oil sanctions against Iran don't cause a stir in the oil markets. But really, it's about supplying them arms that they're using to bomb Yemen and using our refueling planes to supply their jets.
7031 2018-11-21 17:48:08 아..아포칼립스물 소재보면서 조금 구상하니까 약간 욕구가 풀려서 내가 짜던 스토리를 아포칼립스 깍지 없이 볼 수 있게됨
7032 2018-11-21 17:48:06 @timand2037 Tim why Trump says this - Saudy is not responspossible for murder of Kashoggi, Saudy Arabia make good move to make small price of world oil - 35 dollars for 1 barell. Something deep stinks here.
7033 2018-11-21 17:48:01 I’m sure the Canadians can rectify that issue by reducing that amount of oil .
7034 2018-11-21 17:48:01 Cheap oil so who cares if someone gets tortured and chopped to death??
7035 2018-11-21 17:48:00 Shorty swooped in, stole the oil and replaced it with water.
7036 2018-11-21 17:47:57 ไม่ไหวอะ แต่เพลงที่เต้ตี๋ร้อง2คนอะ เพราะอยู่
7037 2018-11-21 17:47:56 What is Mitt bumpin gum about now?...The man was part of the Muslim brotherhood and a Saudi Op..Was judged according to his Sharia Law by his own people in his own country of birth Embassy..You now want Trump to go to war with the Saudi’s to raise the price of oil to $120-$150/b
7038 2018-11-21 17:47:52 0.1% of GDP - fishing. Not saying it's unimportant but get some perspective. For this, we are prepared to forgo 6% of GDP on average. We have a housing crisis, a crisis in the NHS, underfunding of schools & public realm. Stop Brexit. Stop peddling snake oil. Invest in training.
7039 2018-11-21 17:47:47 America sacrificed a hell of a lot more than one life in Iraq for oil@Boggs ky
7040 2018-11-21 17:47:46 تسلمي يا رب 
7041 2018-11-21 17:47:45 Americans are supposed to be okay with Trump's condoning of murder for a few cents off a gallon of gas?  When we get the vast majority of our oil from Canada? The lies are the most transparent part of this administration.
7042 2018-11-21 17:47:38 *forges a fake out-of-state gay card to get into oil can harrys* *bouncer looks up at me and asks if my name is Virginia Flannel*
7043 2018-11-21 17:47:38 Well Texas and shale oil will bankrupt the Saudis. Qatar is laughing because they have natural gas reserves.
7044 2018-11-21 17:47:37 Oil prices usually decrease in the winter and increase in the summer. More people travel during the summertime, that’s why gasoline is more expensive during the summer/fall months.
7045 2018-11-21 17:47:36 I should've known. He's hoping lower oil prices will get him re-elected.
7046 2018-11-21 17:47:32 กัวแล๊ววว ฮ่าาาาาา
7047 2018-11-21 17:47:27 Oil to Hit 30 $
7048 2018-11-21 17:47:26 Also incorrect: his claim that Russia would really like $100-150/b oil.
7049 2018-11-21 17:47:19 trump is so fricking stupid he thinks the Saudis lowered the price of oil to accommodate him. There is a glut you lard ass moron
7050 2018-11-21 17:47:17 Are you saying they’re not drilling or getting oil from Alaska?  I thought they were. Did something change?
7051 2018-11-21 17:47:10 Today I spilled walnut oil all over my bag and the floor :) how’s your day been?
7052 2018-11-21 17:47:08 Wall Street Instant Update; At halftime #Stocks tilt to the upside in pre-Thanksgiving trading with the Dow Industrials gaining 150 at 24,615, the Nasdaq Comp. at 7,015 up 1.5-%, S&P +.9% at 2665

7053 2018-11-21 17:47:08 Nah look how the oil not mixing with it lol
7054 2018-11-21 17:47:07 No I need them high. My stocks are oil based.
7055 2018-11-21 17:47:06 Oil I guess
7056 2018-11-21 17:47:05 We get 40% of our oil from #Canada and 11% from #SaudiArabia    You’re a fraud and an embarrassment.  #25thAmendmentNow #GOPTraitors #KhashoggiMurder
7057 2018-11-21 17:47:04 I honestly have a had such a hard week, and this might sound crazy but I had to get my oil changed and tires rotated and was dreading it... but I ended up having the best time talking with the people there
7058 2018-11-21 17:47:04 It's a complex world oil market.  Sanctions in other areas
7059 2018-11-21 17:47:00 And I thought I was the only one who thinks that every time I switch the news on! 
We all knew that he would side with the Saudis. Today he even thanked them for the low oil prices!! Creep!
And obviously it‘s a different story when Ivanka does the same thing Hillary did 
7060 2018-11-21 17:46:57 This is immoral and Ilegale!,ufo the sudia states wish to join in with the rest of world and sell their OIL legetamally!,then they must OBEY all the rules that go with that commitment!?
7061 2018-11-21 17:46:52 Beeswax will work but i use propolis and coconut oil added
7062 2018-11-21 17:46:46 Imagine an effort to get every individual eligiable to vote the proper ID to vote with and enforce the law. If Mexico can do it why can't we?
7063 2018-11-21 17:46:44 Isn’t the US a largest provider of crude oil?
7064 2018-11-21 17:46:33 We really need to undercut any type of rent seeking economy that leads to international corruption. From vampire Banks to oil to making Indians pay us pharam companies for patents. But for oil we've gotta fix it soon.
7065 2018-11-21 17:46:30 We produce very much oil from North Sea  But cheap oil is good for world trade.
7066 2018-11-21 17:46:21 Increased US oil production has more to do with low oil prices than SA production.
7067 2018-11-21 17:46:20 You know how they tell you CBD oil doesn't have any Cheech & Chong-ish effects? They lied. Just took my 1st half-dropper full. Tried to use my work ID as my phone number. Note to self: you may want to take this stuff in the evening before bed, not on the way to work...Jes' sayin'
7068 2018-11-21 17:46:13 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
7069 2018-11-21 17:46:10 friendship & money / oil & water
7070 2018-11-21 17:46:08 Ecostyler blackcastor oil ou bien tu prend ru gel d'aloe vera  ( tu peux en acheter chez Aroma-Zone ) et tu les utilise c bcp plus naturel
7071 2018-11-21 17:46:06 WRONG! if you don't think Saudi Arabia has a huge affect on oil prices, you're dreaming.
7072 2018-11-21 17:46:02 ไปฟังพี่ แล้วมาบอกด้วยว่าพี่เลิกฟังในวินาทีที่เท่าไร 555555555555555
7073 2018-11-21 17:46:00 The Uncle or the nephew? Cause the Uncle would be the guy programming the robot while the robot took over the schmucks job who thought he should get 15 an hour for pulling fries out of hot oil.
7074 2018-11-21 17:45:58 And many producers of expensive oil (e.g. fracking and oil sands) will go bankrupt.
So good for the economy.
7075 2018-11-21 17:45:55 Total Trump crap, wants credit for oil prices. His lack of understanding oil prices is astounding! Saudi Arabia is not the reason for current prices, that's just stupid & uninformed. Trump has had no effect at all on oil prices. Educate yourselves & don't fall for more lies!!!!
7076 2018-11-21 17:45:54 Really enjoyed the whinging and Trudeau blaming over at the @nationalpost regarding oil prices and losses with no regard to market realities.  Guess that is what happens when you transition from a respected newspaper to #Conservative mouthpiece. #cdnmedia #cdnpoli
7077 2018-11-21 17:45:51 Trump just thanked Saudi Arabia for lowering the price of Crude oil..maybe we should have asked Japan after Pearl Harbor to lower there prices on electronics.. no need to go to war it’s all good!!!
7078 2018-11-21 17:45:45 They have completed two challenges. Killing an American and now lower oil prices in return #CanTheyGoFor3
7079 2018-11-21 17:45:41 We provide more of our own oil than what we import from Saudi Arabia. Another made up fact to try and hide that you condone murder for money.
7080 2018-11-21 17:45:39 ใช่มะ ตัวพี่ก็แยกแบบนั้นแต่ร้านกาแฟแบบในห้างเหมือนเขาไม่รู้จัก เวลาไปสั่งก็จะติดปากว่าชาเย็นเขาก็จะชานมเย็นใช่ไหมคะ ทุกทีเลย
7081 2018-11-21 17:45:37 Oh yeah so the grill man set the oil on fire at my job the other day so that was fun
7082 2018-11-21 17:45:37 I worked at Prudhoe Bay and reality is different from sanitized oil company tours
7083 2018-11-21 17:45:34 #oil was down over 30% since Oct 2. Bounces make it interesting
7084 2018-11-21 17:45:32 Make sure your turkey is completely thawed and DO NOT FILL IT UP WITH THE DEEP FRY OIL. YOU CAN POUR IN THE REST ONCE YOU'VE PUT THE TURKEY IN.
7085 2018-11-21 17:45:27 @HuskyEnergy you followed procedures in Newfoundland oil spill? You think that makes everything okay instead of realizing the procedures are flawed? Keep destroying the environment  #OILSpill #newfoundland
7086 2018-11-21 17:45:27 Hot oil, deep tissue massage would be amazing right about now!!!
7087 2018-11-21 17:45:22 Thank uuu dear 
7088 2018-11-21 17:45:19 …impunity, and then follows up by thanking the country (the CIA clearly finds ordered the killing) for oil prices. Congress says they want answers and action. I hope they stand behind the words & proposed legislation. Leader McConnell will you stand behind the hardworking CIA?
7089 2018-11-21 17:45:15 Changed out the oil now its ah foe in the sunkist
7090 2018-11-21 17:45:15 Our collective soul is lower still, siding with a murderer for oil and hotels.... shame on us.
7091 2018-11-21 17:45:11 Rubbish, both Northern & Southern hemisphere temperate climates can produce more than enough non fatty (unlike Palm Oil) oils on current arable land on crop rotation! FGS you are supposed to be knowledgeable!
7092 2018-11-21 17:45:11 ME TO MYSELF: "I can buy a filter for $10 and replace it myself."

REALITY: **Let's it ride a few more oil changes until it's so dirty I just agree to let them do it**
7093 2018-11-21 17:45:09 Oil demand has lowered prices, not Saudi Arabia.  Do you really not understand the concept of supply and demand and the world economy?  Are you that unintelligent or just so deep into MBS's pockets that you can no longer see the light of day.
7094 2018-11-21 17:45:05 Doubled down on his Saudi comments and thanked them for lowering oil prices since he sided with them.
7095 2018-11-21 17:45:05 It’s all about the oil... don’t forget 15/19 9/11 high jackers from Saudi Arabia. We basically are bullies . We pick on those who are weak. It’s always about our economy and oil is a big part
7096 2018-11-21 17:45:01 We now produce more oil than any country in the world. We get only about 11% of our oil from the Saudi Arabia.
7097 2018-11-21 17:44:57 Stupid me for not remembering to buy the burpless fish oil pills ... fkn a #yuck
7098 2018-11-21 17:44:54 How about investing in renewable energy? It's the 21st century. We don't need oil or coal anymore jackass!!!
7099 2018-11-21 17:44:52 Good show today, this is like Oil Talk.
7100 2018-11-21 17:44:51 Nymex wti crude oil traders...  I have given here LIVE FREE calls...  check my all tweet... I have given  57 calls... profit given... 50 calls... and loss given only... 7 call...  my trading style is non risky... I have given Total pft... $35640  U.S Dollars
7101 2018-11-21 17:44:50 USA get zero oil from middle east
Our oil comes from USA
We export more oil than we use
Refinery fires create increased cost
Funny they always occur at certain times
Look no further than when prices drop
Always same
Graphs never lie
Politicians lie
Statistical analysis never lies
7102 2018-11-21 17:44:50 この怪獣の人形昔家にあったや、よく間違えて踏んでメチャクチャ痛かった
7103 2018-11-21 17:44:44 But Fuck us Canadians who supply 40% of your oil vs. 13% Saudis.. but we're a security threat 

7104 2018-11-21 17:44:43 I mean, we kind of need a stable global economy more than specific barrels of oil, but point taken. We need the Saudis somewhat but not as much as we act like we do.
7105 2018-11-21 17:44:38  provides 40% of oil to  but Saoudy Arabia around 10% only. And yet #45th praise S.A. and critics  Why ? 
7106 2018-11-21 17:44:38 The only reason the left cares about this is because they want oil prices to go up and destroy the global economy and blame it on trump so there sorry Party can have a chance in 2020.
7107 2018-11-21 17:44:38 The other thing Trump neglected to mention is that we only import 8% of our oil usage from the Saudis.
7108 2018-11-21 17:44:36 And said publicly he sided with them for the bribe of temporarily lower oil prices.
7109 2018-11-21 17:44:34 But it's America 1st to have an ME ally to counter Iran/Russia/China. It's also America 1st to keep oil prices low & to honor contracts signed with SA which will lead to US jobs. King Abdullah rules SA,&had nothing to do with the murder of an SA citizen/Muslim Brotherhood agent
7110 2018-11-21 17:44:32 Some these clobbered oil stocks like CRC making big moves today
7111 2018-11-21 17:44:29 I use Cuticura face Scrub dont think u should change just add a some oil for that added moisture
7112 2018-11-21 17:44:15 That's not to say we don't need it at all. People forget plastic is made from oil, for example. But the need for oil for bldg heat is drastically less "thanks" to nat.gas fracking.  Cars' MPG is better, too. 

We could mostly get what we need elsewhere from SA, if necessary.
7113 2018-11-21 17:44:13 No you aren’t always negative.
I do think PC talked to Hitch in the summer regarding a backup plan, I think TM knew his leash was going to be short if the team got in a funk.
Short term I think Hitch is the right solution
7114 2018-11-21 17:44:12 If the oil prices are lower, it's thanks to you ignoring the murder of a U.S. resident. Let's go lower? I don't know how much lower you can go.
7115 2018-11-21 17:44:11 If he was being their bitch wouldn't the price of oil be going up instead. How does bringing the price of their main export down make him their bitch? You know it makes people's food cheaper & pretty much everything else for that matter.
7116 2018-11-21 17:44:11 And he said something that’s contrary to what I said? Ohh I forgot you think they need a PhD for waste management lol. But you’re in APC so I’m not surprised, you guys and logic are like water and oil 
7117 2018-11-21 17:44:08 Well since she’s the one paying for the oil , guess she has the right to set the temp at whatever she wants 
7118 2018-11-21 17:44:05 Yes, we don't care of you murder innocent people.  Just give us a deal on oil.  Oh Yeah Donnie, how much did it cost us to pay for you to "kick off" the season in  Mar a Lago this weekend?
7119 2018-11-21 17:44:04 I have an appointment for an oil change and tire rotation. That does not take 90 minutes, Toyota!
7120 2018-11-21 17:44:00 Hence, Rumpys war on our closest Ally! 
 Ru & Saudi Oil  $$$$$$$$$$$
7121 2018-11-21 17:43:56 Obviously those who follow the price of oil on exchanges know it's gone down. Moronic leftists, who don't understand finance and economics will just make up stuff to have something to say.
7122 2018-11-21 17:43:51 [Political Tweet]

How many showers will I have to take until I stop feeling like this? One life for cheap oil ... this is not my president. Not ever.
7123 2018-11-21 17:43:50 Blood Oil!  @realDonaldTrump way to go.  Pumping my gas over a dead man’s body!
7124 2018-11-21 17:43:47 Another liberal that has no clue about how the oil industry works or the economy in general. It's nice to say you will pay more for gas when you are making $200k + from the taxpayers funds. Not all Americans can afford to pay extra for your political games.
7125 2018-11-21 17:43:44 @realDonaldTrump stop sucking Saudi Arabia’s dick. Just another oil bitch in office. The prince had a journalist chopped up in his embassy and you’re all like “ but we’re gonna sell em weapons so it’s cool” wtf is going on in Washington?
7126 2018-11-21 17:43:44 Hmmm. You just tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which you  liken to 'a big Tax Cut for America and the World!' In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.... Your welcome, Canada
7127 2018-11-21 17:43:43 Better yet let's stop using oil altogether!!!
7128 2018-11-21 17:43:41 .@realDonaldTrump Check stats on oil production you are in error in what you said, big surprise!
7129 2018-11-21 17:43:38 For dry skin...

Mix 2 tea spoons of coconut oil and honey together.
Then add 1 drop of lavender oil, massage gently for 10 - 15 mins then rinse off thoroughly.

Repeat 1 - 2 x a week for best results.
7130 2018-11-21 17:43:38 we’ll go under oil and water or we separate
7131 2018-11-21 17:43:36 Who knows how to change an oil
7132 2018-11-21 17:43:34 President Trump isn't worried about price of oil, we have our own. However, 
his hotel investments in Saudi, he is worried about.
7133 2018-11-21 17:43:22 And his figures on oil are incorrect. High price is highest for 1 kind of oil. The "low" price he quotes is the low for an entirely different grade (less expensive) oil. Typical trump BS.
7134 2018-11-21 17:43:21 Relations with Saudi Arabia should be suspended until the next crown prince is installed by the Saudi authorities. They'll still sell oil and the relationship won't be impaired. Other candidates abound, don't let anyone say differently.
7135 2018-11-21 17:43:20 Boiler. Oil or steam
7136 2018-11-21 17:43:16 One persons life is worth more than the price of oil. You are an awful awful human being.  I would like to send you a big thank you if you would just go back to TRUMP TOWER. There must be a meeting you are missing.  Disgusting tweet
7137 2018-11-21 17:43:16 Murder to @realDonaldTrump is just a way for him to get lower oil prices!
7138 2018-11-21 17:43:14 I would rather blow up all their oil fields like in Iron Eagle. In all seriousness Kushner, Trump, Pompeo and MBS should be punished.
7139 2018-11-21 17:43:06 Those barrels of oil are coated in blood 
7140 2018-11-21 17:43:00 @RepSeanDuffy @JulieBanderas @LisaMarieBoothe #Outnumbered @RCamposDuffy 

If we break w/ Saudi Arabia America losses the Petro dollar, higher oil prices worldwide, Iran & Hezbollah gain power and start moving back toward the Mediterranean. Sometimes all we have are bad options
7141 2018-11-21 17:42:59 Lower prices aren’t good for a specific industry in this country. You don’t know this, but a few years ago 1000’s of people lost their jobs when oil prices bottomed out. But keep the Saudis and YOUR pockets the priority, MAGA.
7142 2018-11-21 17:42:57 CBD oil gravy
7143 2018-11-21 17:42:45 The sad thing is we buy more oil from Canada than we do Saudi Arabia. So they really didn't do s*** for gas prices.
7144 2018-11-21 17:42:41 I’m pretty sure you have to do yoga whilst slathered in emu oil. That’s the key to the cure
7145 2018-11-21 17:42:38 @GregAbbott_TX You need to have a conversation with @realDonaldTrump . He has no clue how much low oil prices are about to hurt hundreds of thousands of oil industry workers
7146 2018-11-21 17:42:37 Yeah Saudi... it's finefinefine to murder our journalist and lie about it over and over as long as you cut oil prices... I mean, dollars over souls. Right?
7147 2018-11-21 17:42:25 so the CIA said Saudi Arabia killed that journalist and trump says "maybe they did maybe they didnt thanks to the Crown Prince for making oil cheap"

this nigga done snapped
7148 2018-11-21 17:42:23 Kaitlin, reporters must question @POTUS on facts:
1-Oil price plunge is due to rising supply & economic slowdown fears
2-Drop coincides w/2nd day of steep US stock market losses
3-US gets only 8% of its oil from the Saudis
4-OPEC will meet soon to draw down supply & boost prices
7149 2018-11-21 17:42:21 Farming generates a fraction of the jobs/revenue of the oil patch.  In fact many farms plan their financing around oil revenue.  Albertans won’t forget your anti-oil & gas / high tax governance.
7150 2018-11-21 17:42:19 Reporter : "what about people who say you're only interested in the middle eastern for oil?"

Black Bush : "huh?.. Oil? Who said something about oil, bitch you cooking!!?" 
#DaveChapelleShow 
7151 2018-11-21 17:42:17 For #Scotland a disastrous #Brexit make #Indyref2 a certainty. Why should I vote to save England given the hundreds of poisonous and insulting tweets I’ve seen saying Scotland costs too much! (Oil, of course, forgotten!)
7152 2018-11-21 17:42:14 Trying to oil wash dismemeberment........ your a piece of work....try listening to the tape of the khasoggi murder..... you wont they aye because your have no balls or the couarage of your convictions
7153 2018-11-21 17:42:13 Do...do they have oil? Are they buying any fighter jets? Asking for a friend.
7154 2018-11-21 17:42:09 The only reason the left cares about this is because they want oil prices to go up and destroy the global economy and blame it on trump so there sorry Party can have a chance in 2020.
7155 2018-11-21 17:42:08 That "bond" was U.S. unquenchable thirst for oil.
7156 2018-11-21 17:42:08 as I understand it oil prices are lower due to the middle east not honoring the limits imposed on how much they drill, and they are flooding the markets
7157 2018-11-21 17:42:07 Canada is your biggest importer of oil you dolt
7158 2018-11-21 17:42:05 I think it smells like olive oil lmao
7159 2018-11-21 17:42:03 He’s been bought and paid for! And now... Oil Price plummeting. Gas Prices plummeting.. Its the great “payoff” with cheap gas.. They expect us to no longer “care” about Mr. Khashoggi
7160 2018-11-21 17:42:02 Crude oil
7161 2018-11-21 17:42:00 I know sharing all the facts isn't exactly your thing, but consider this: We pay less to Canada which is still only about 16% of the oil we use. 40% is from our own production. Of course you will not share all the facts because they are to positive. You must be negative.
7162 2018-11-21 17:41:58 Pretty sure I just heard @MariaBartiromo praise @realDonaldTrump for great #Thanksgiving oil prices from #Saudis. Guess everyone’s ok with murder now? #1khasoggifor28abarrel
7163 2018-11-21 17:41:58 Yeah, nothing spells friend like money. 
Trump constantly insults Canada, Mexico and Venezuela who provide a much larger portion of our imported oil. 
We provide most of our own oil. Production in the last few years has doubled while demand has declined. So, prices have slipped.
7164 2018-11-21 17:41:57 Yang raice brand oil, kamu juga kah?
7165 2018-11-21 17:41:56 Fact: Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
7166 2018-11-21 17:41:51 Once again the president proves his lack of knowledge is astounding. He’s confused US Crude and Brent Crude oil prices. “U.S. crude has indeed fallen to the low-$50s, but it has not traded at $82 since late 2014.” And he made it clear that ANY atrocity can be paid for through $$
7167 2018-11-21 17:41:44 Also, this is not how the oil markets work, at all
7168 2018-11-21 17:41:42 It's true. Since the move to sales, my taste for the finer things in life has grown to encompass all of my power plant requirements. Also, I like my oil refineries in tartan velour and my smelting plants in hamster fur
7169 2018-11-21 17:41:42 I listened to an interview in which lowering oil prices are worrisome to Russia and Saudi/OPEC and that Americans shouldn't be surprised when they start holding back supply to raise the demand.  Would Trump then "thank" them for raising prices and earning us more gas tax $$?
7170 2018-11-21 17:41:40 This is proof that American President Trump doesn't give a shit about human life.  He thanks Saudi Arabia for low oil prices, even though they murder of Khashoggi and cause war crimes in Yemen.
7171 2018-11-21 17:41:39 Did you use some kind of oil paint for this? It looks really gooood!
7172 2018-11-21 17:41:36 Oh, you are absolutely right. We certainly need to cut right back on meat, those of us who are not veggie. Palm oil in everything is an abomination to the environment. Overfishing....one can go on ad infinitum.
7173 2018-11-21 17:41:35 Because oil deal has been fixed! Saudis will let it float lower and not push for aggressive cuts.
7174 2018-11-21 17:41:34 They tortured, murdered and dismembered a US resident. I don't care about their damn oil or anything else.
7175 2018-11-21 17:41:33 Did it ever occur to you that break even oil companies is about $50 a barrel? You're such a terrible businessman you probably don't understand profit-and-loss. Mister bankruptcy King
7176 2018-11-21 17:41:32 The majority of the times you hear the phrase, "Normally it is safe to (....)" are in discussions of plane crashes, deep water oil and gas drilling, fireworks displays  and selling winter natural gas options. #OOTT #natgas
7177 2018-11-21 17:41:29 Saudi output impacts the price of oil, that’s a fact
7178 2018-11-21 17:41:27 Lol it was not Saudi. It was our own government. Controlled demolition.  Air patrol purposefully called off. WTC 7 falling... You really think this was pulled off by some dude in a cave in Saudi on dialysis? Nah lol. This was to establish Zionist Banks & take oil.
7179 2018-11-21 17:41:24 They will be asking for Scottish Oil revenues as well!
7180 2018-11-21 17:41:19 Ojalá la haga, porque es la cosa más inmoral que se pueda uno imaginar: decidir a quién juzgar en base a una "consulta" ("motín" me parece más acertado). Como diría la Muller, "mejor pónganse a leer", sugiero empezar con Camus.
7181 2018-11-21 17:41:17 Hope oil :((
7182 2018-11-21 17:41:14 Or those of us just tired of everything containing coconut oil.
7183 2018-11-21 17:41:07 Oil prices are lower because USA and Russia are flooding the market with oil. Has nothing to do with Saudis
7184 2018-11-21 17:41:02 A linha creoula da Lola. Gosto do shampoo Argan Oil (também da Lola)
7185 2018-11-21 17:40:59 Enjoy those lower oil prices, they are paid for in human blood & suffering.
7186 2018-11-21 17:40:54 How many journalists you gonna let them kill to get lower oil prices?
7187 2018-11-21 17:40:49 Getting deals on oil is tho
7188 2018-11-21 17:40:42 You realize the US imports 40% of its oil from Canada compared to 11% from your murderous Saudi financial backers? Of course you don’t.
7189 2018-11-21 17:40:40 Gee, @realDonaldTrump , why don’t you recommend Saudi Prince “Bone Saw”? For those great oil prices, cough, cough.
7190 2018-11-21 17:40:39 Our Adolf in the old world also  loved when critics were killed and oil prices went down. You and him - such a pair.
7191 2018-11-21 17:40:38 One word explains our economic dependence on Saudi Arabian oil...
PETRODOLLARS.
7192 2018-11-21 17:40:38 @realdonaldtrump 
Facts:
"Iraqi oil imports to the U.S. surpassed Saudi imports in Oct/18 for the 1st time since 1985" (ClipperData) 
2017: U.S. imports of foreign petroleum were about 19% of U.S. consumption.(EIA) 
Shouldn't you thank the USA instead? Oh, and Iraq? #AmericaFirst
7193 2018-11-21 17:40:37 Hey there agent orange, Saudi Arabia isn't responsible for the price of oil. Ever heard of supply & demand?  There's currently a surplus in the market, thanks to the largest oil producer, America. You're welcome - read a book.
7194 2018-11-21 17:40:35 He’s trying to check your oil
7195 2018-11-21 17:40:35 Getting an oil change and this dude asks me to turn my fog lights on and let me tell you how stupid I felt
7196 2018-11-21 17:40:33 BTW...cheap oil is not good for the Texas economy. Jobs will be lost. And cheaper oil means nothing when trillions of dollars are being lost in the markets because of YOU! You are ruining what President Obama created. btw, did I mention he killed Bin Laden? He made us proud.
7197 2018-11-21 17:40:32 Nope. There's plenty of oil in Alaska and fracking has found hundreds of years of natural gas. If only the environmentalist on the left would get out of the way and allow production.
7198 2018-11-21 17:40:31 #PornPresident what a deal you made....murder for cheaper oil.
7199 2018-11-21 17:40:30 あ、猫…！と、遠回りしようぜ？
7200 2018-11-21 17:40:27 My only issue is you. The snake oil salesman
7201 2018-11-21 17:40:20 Grateful for CBD oil
7202 2018-11-21 17:40:18 My restaurant experience in Karonga
Res 1: we've run out of rice (mind you its karonga) at 7pm
Res 2: we've run out of cooking oil so we can't give you fried fish
But life must go on innit?.. So we move on..
7203 2018-11-21 17:40:16 The Owens kid, too. Chris Beard can make oil and vinegar gel. Amazing how quick his teams come together.
7204 2018-11-21 17:40:09 泣いてなんかいないよ、これは心の油だ。
7205 2018-11-21 17:40:05 Americans are less important that oil. If you didn’t know, now you know.
7206 2018-11-21 17:40:04 The Saudis reign will end when people stop depending on oil. Unfortunately, they probably have all their money invested in preventing just that .
7207 2018-11-21 17:40:04 so the beheading of a journalist is worth a drop in oil prices , I wonder how low it can drop if they murder a tv star , an athlete or a politician , the possibilities are endless
7208 2018-11-21 17:40:02 Plus, the US imports far more of its oil from Canada. Apparently Saudi accounts for only 11%.
7209 2018-11-21 17:39:58 Oil prices have increase 30 percent since January 2017. Thanks Saudi Arabia
7210 2018-11-21 17:39:57 CATASTROPHIC!!! BLOOD OVER OIL
7211 2018-11-21 17:39:57 They didnt bail. Alberta built them... The Trudeau’s screwed them. Now their taking the oil for $14/bbl and selling it for $70 elsewhere. It’s also why almost every other head office is in US.Inputs all paid for in Can$ profits are in US $. Ps our gas prices reflect the $70 bbl
7212 2018-11-21 17:39:57 OK @jimmykimmel You've had Gwyneth Paltrow on your show now it's time to have @DrJenGunter on to clear up these self healing snake oil fallacies that her Goop company pushes. Seriously
7213 2018-11-21 17:39:55 This is the Holy Trinity of Trump tweets!

1. Lies about oil prices falling $28.
2. Shows ignorance of where we get our oil from.
3. Callous and heartless praise of a brutal murdering regime.
7214 2018-11-21 17:39:55 Uh, prices are controlled by the market, not an individual entity.  Thanks should go to the American workers who produced more oil and developed cars with higher gas mileage.  Supply is up and demand is down.  Simple economics Mr. President.  I thought you were a business man?
7215 2018-11-21 17:39:54 #OPEC controls oil prices. Man, it sickens me that #FoxNews have no desire to educate their viewers and the cycle of stupidity will never end.
7216 2018-11-21 17:39:53 I like the @skathire Occam’s razor approach. If this were a p=0.049 type deal I think it would be a much different conversation. Separating the MoA vs mineral oil conversation seems important.
7217 2018-11-21 17:39:52 I just want oil prices as low as possible. I don't really care about Khashoogi. Sorry...
7218 2018-11-21 17:39:51 We in Pakistan have gone bankrupt due to high crude oil cost. Thanks President Trump initiative to bring them down. Its a big tax cut for entire world.
7219 2018-11-21 17:39:51 There’s always an oil rig somewhere that needs intervention 
7220 2018-11-21 17:39:47 Saudi supplies 11% of the oil consumed. 
Canada supplies 44%. 

7221 2018-11-21 17:39:45 Sir, it's worth reminding people that American dependence on Saudi oil is, in real terms, a hell of a lot less than it was 20 years ago. There's a sense that we have to put up with SA's bullshit because we'd all die without their oil, and that's simply not true anymore.
7222 2018-11-21 17:39:45 There can be no more uncertainty as to whom today's (so-called) Conservative parties are aiming to please. Beer, firearms, the oil biz and "old time religion" for all the lowbrow would-be Texas millionaires. Seriously, #cdnpoli, would you buy into this?
7223 2018-11-21 17:39:41 Except 40% of your oil is from , and we disagree with America.....a lot, these days.
We're smucks and the Saudis......who are no where near our level of economic influence for you....are sweetie pies. 
This will help Trump and hurt America for a long time.
7224 2018-11-21 17:39:39 Low oil prices is terrible for the world. Learn economics.
7225 2018-11-21 17:39:35 sickkkkkk I just spent $100 at this dumb ass oil change place
7226 2018-11-21 17:39:34 What % of our oil do we actually get from Saudi Arabia  Who supplies us the most
7227 2018-11-21 17:39:29 same!! but I also found a better hack which is dampening the beauty blender with face oil!!!!
7228 2018-11-21 17:39:28 Extra virgin olive oil.
7229 2018-11-21 17:39:28 On the news there is a glut of oil on themarket. USA is producing so much&that’s why oil prices r staying low. tRump’s spinning lies to his cultist members. Why is this day different then any other day? PS he’s pulling military from south border when immigrants haven’t come yet!
7230 2018-11-21 17:39:27 I’m old enough to remember when “Arms for Oil” was a thing, now in Trump’s MAGA it’s gone literal. #impeachTheComplicitMurdererTrump #TraitorTrump #TrumpCrimeFamily
7231 2018-11-21 17:39:25 US is the biggest producer of oil. WE DON'T NEED THOSE SAUDIS!!
7232 2018-11-21 17:39:24 I'm the ocean, you're an oil slick
Now I am choking on your thought pollution
7233 2018-11-21 17:39:24 @realDonaldTrump If oil prices are getting lower, why am I still paying so much for gas, then, Donnie? #sitdowndon #youorangemotherfucker
7234 2018-11-21 17:39:21 ALBERTA OIL!! Refineries built, operated and owned by Albertans.
7235 2018-11-21 17:39:20 ‘They’ are the companies that produce the products and most of those will not be UK based. They will be interested in the cheapest form of oil, in most cases, and that would most likely not be from here. This is a global problem that can’t be solved locally.
7236 2018-11-21 17:39:09 Should I sack off my job in oil? 
7237 2018-11-21 17:39:09 No degree. Went straight into design. Only option when I was out of school was learning how to make lithographs or paint with oil.
7238 2018-11-21 17:39:08 Diffuser bead necklaces and charms I have made.

Think Christmas gifts!

7241 2018-11-21 17:39:01 same,if you put sugar on them and wash it off and let it dry,then you add to a bowl,put some lemon juice,oil,and salt on it,it makes a nice salad
7242 2018-11-21 17:38:59 40% of Americas oil comes from Canada ,11% from Saudi Arabia,30 pieces of sliver was not for oil.
7243 2018-11-21 17:38:57 Why? I'm using 2 miracle products for my hair The Ordinary Hair serum and Macadamia Oil Shampoo (magical)
7244 2018-11-21 17:38:55 Shout out to all the dads at world vw right now getting their college aged daughters oil changed. I remember when Greg loved me that much.
7245 2018-11-21 17:38:52 Trump only cares about him and his children's money... Trump said "George Bush biggest mistake was not stealing the oil from Iraq" to trump human lives mean nothing and oil and$$$ mean everything.
7246 2018-11-21 17:38:47 There is crude stock piling in Canada but actually oil stocks are trailing natural gas. And since winter is coming NG is expected to surge $5 and that means WTI also surges.

PS: that's not a manner to address a President. Shame on you!
7247 2018-11-21 17:38:46 True Statement! Believe it or not - a few prophetic words have been given about USA/Israel (increased oil supplies) cornering the nations market!
7248 2018-11-21 17:38:45 Same WhatsApp group nevarikutengesa cooking oil from source. It's a Zim trend. Happened a lot in 2008 as well. Normalise things and them not getting any attention will get them back on track...

7250 2018-11-21 17:38:34 Farmers.   Wake up.   U bought bull shit  from a snake oil salesman   U got suckered.   Learn from your mistakes   Use that brain.  Learn
7251 2018-11-21 17:38:33 Canada is being robbed by USA, our oil is at record lows and USA is laughing all the way to the bank...meanwhile they are saying thanks to us and we are suppose to be grateful. Get bent you political hack.
7252 2018-11-21 17:38:31 Still unpacking Trump saying 1 journalist’s life aint a reason to risk our oil prices rising...Is that America first? 
7253 2018-11-21 17:38:31 Stop you're complaining you know nothing about the world.first of all everyone in Saudi Arabia and the foreign countries get free gas all of them not one of them pay for it so you and I pay for it and as long as our United States will keep a lid on the oil wells we have .     ...
7254 2018-11-21 17:38:29 And most of our oil comes from  Canada.
7255 2018-11-21 17:38:29 Almond oil doesn't darken you??
7256 2018-11-21 17:38:29 @PhonePeSupport
Hii I want to know the list of outlets of hindustan petroleum and Indian oil tied up with you in city varanasi
7257 2018-11-21 17:38:20 Does butchering journalists lower oil prices? I missed that in Econ 101
7258 2018-11-21 17:38:17 Yea Rachel, let's kill that Prince, call off our relationship with the Saudis, let Russia and China take the arms deals with the Saudis, let's ignore the presence of Iran, let's not protect Isreal, Let's have high oil prices...yeah, tell the world Rachel. What, no solution?
7259 2018-11-21 17:38:11 GEEPERS, lower gas prices has not on DAMN thing to do with US being Oil Independent AND!!!! there is a stockpile of OIL RIGHT NOW.
7260 2018-11-21 17:38:09 I used to get covered in chamomile oil when I was younger (alongside prescribed creams)! Calms the irritation you get from prolonged steroid cream use sooo much x alternatively oatmeal baths!!
7261 2018-11-21 17:38:03 For Christmas i’m getting new tires and an oil change and I’m ecstatic
7262 2018-11-21 17:38:00 We get more oil from Canada than from Saudi Arabia. Trump is up to his ears in corruption - SA probably bailed out his corporation and now they own him.
7263 2018-11-21 17:37:59 @CBCNews Where is the OIL SPILL news !?
7264 2018-11-21 17:37:58 Ke December di kolo di kwalletsi, castor oil your digestive tract before December e toma pila pila..
7265 2018-11-21 17:37:57 Best friends do not pay fraction of price. Alberta oil being sold to USA for $14 instead of $58. US Govts & Corporations political meddling ensures Canada doesn’t get fair price @POTUS tweet on top of that adds insult to injury. Conservatives in govt for decades created this MESS
7266 2018-11-21 17:37:57 I wonder if Bernstein considers an article about alternative energy to be a negative article about oil.
7267 2018-11-21 17:37:54 Murderers, but hey a discount on Oil like happens before every holiday buying season.= FREE PASS.
7268 2018-11-21 17:37:48 oil pastels really are trash why do we have to work with them i hate it i hate it i hate it
7269 2018-11-21 17:37:48 Oil production also destroys any healthy environment (especially fracking); driving out animals, killing animals if there is a spill, and fracking destroys human water table & pollutes for years.
 It is a lose, lose fuel.
We need to move on from this dirty destructive fuel.
7270 2018-11-21 17:37:42 Someone could compare it to corn oil.
7271 2018-11-21 17:37:34 Gotta get and oil change and a car wash so I can drive to Cali tonight 
7272 2018-11-21 17:37:31 Don't tell him that we're the #1 producer of Oil in the world because he'll start taking credit for it.
7273 2018-11-21 17:37:30 Why is the seal oil family throwing their baby into the sea?
7274 2018-11-21 17:37:25 I was never talking about an oil deal. The original Nixon deal was that we would give the Saudi's arms and in exchange they would only sell their oil for US dollars... boosting our economy. It was always an oil deal and an arms deal.
7275 2018-11-21 17:37:17 Yes! Which supplies more of our oil anyway
7276 2018-11-21 17:37:14 No wonder he said he would of caught Bin Laden earlier .., he would of caught him to thank him and beg for lower oil prices
7277 2018-11-21 17:37:11 Tea tree oil is everything
7278 2018-11-21 17:37:05 Carrot seed oil is awesome 
You can make it yourself or buy from organic cream sellers
7279 2018-11-21 17:37:04 Honestly. Probably high on Olive oil
7280 2018-11-21 17:37:04 The only reason the left cares about this is because they want oil prices to go up and destroy the global economy and blame it on trump so there sorry Party can have a chance in 2020.
7281 2018-11-21 17:37:03 Well Trump is trying to get Americans to forget about his tax cut failure, with reduce oil prices. Wonder what Trump had to give Arabia in return.
7282 2018-11-21 17:37:00 Make sure you drain the oil off your cheese before adding it to your cheese sauce. If not you will not like the end result.
7283 2018-11-21 17:36:59 Rally continues to hang in there w/ tech improving and retail bouncing back.  AAPL only up a fraction and NFLX stuck in the red, while BBY is giving back yesterday's gain. Gov't bond yields are up and oil is rallying from a year low.
7284 2018-11-21 17:36:53 My coworkers just so happened to look under the hood of my car yesterday and my ass ain’t have no oil or coolant in that mf 
7285 2018-11-21 17:36:52 i hate oil pastels sm FUCK U OIL PASTELS YOUR PASTEL SIBLING IS BETTER THEN U
7286 2018-11-21 17:36:50 Human lives are not valued.  Oil/money, is more important.  This is our message to the world.
7287 2018-11-21 17:36:46 We get most of our oil about 40%from Canada and about under 10% from Saudi Arabia. Again he makes up facts.
7288 2018-11-21 17:36:42 @realDonaldTrump The US arms deal & oil interests with Saudi Arabia are more important than #JusticeForJamal that is so wrong & why most Americans can't stand you
7289 2018-11-21 17:36:40 Whether it's true or not (probably not) you're bragging that you sold a man's life for oil? He was dismembered. He died a horrible, painful, brutal death. His fiance was waiting for him outside. What kind of monster are you? Sociopath to be sure. Now I wonder maybe psychopath.
7290 2018-11-21 17:36:36 Saudi provides 10 percent of US oil imports. Canada provides 40 percent, currently at 19 bucks a barrel. So who should Trump be thanking, and treating a whole lot better than he has?
7291 2018-11-21 17:36:35 Blood oil. No thanks.
7292 2018-11-21 17:36:33 Have you tried vitamin E oil?
7293 2018-11-21 17:36:31 We have a President who has made millions off of oil Ritch nations by way of housing projects.

7296 2018-11-21 17:36:27 NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  100’s of thousands of jobs lost in the last oil crash and we haven’t been back to work for even a year.  We need $70 oil not $30.
7297 2018-11-21 17:36:26 Because they’re the only source of oil?
7298 2018-11-21 17:36:25 He heard they discovered oil
7299 2018-11-21 17:36:25 UAE is very rich due to oil.
7300 2018-11-21 17:36:24 You must really be sick to be able to justify murder in your mind by the Saudi Government all because of oil prices and arms deals.  Oh yeah and the 4 time they saved you from bankruptcy....   What else do they have on you?
7301 2018-11-21 17:36:20 Its never too early for this at any Vegas gas station.              Random dude: dammmm you fine and thicky thicky ! When was the last time someone rubbed you down with some baby oil and glitter ?                         In my head :  not a bad idea

7307 2018-11-21 17:36:06 i need to learn how to change my own oil. y’all gmfu 
7308 2018-11-21 17:36:06 My husband did a trial run this morning on a new dinner role recipe. It came out good but not amazing, then I realized I oiled the bowl for its first rise with rancid oil.
Mary Berry would be SO DISAPPOINTED
7309 2018-11-21 17:36:03 People be tryn do my hair and not put oil in it... like bitch I’m black I need oil in my hair
7310 2018-11-21 17:36:02 Two things: (1) Oil prices are NOT getting lower, GAS PRICES have gone UP; and (2) the "Thank You" is REPULSIVE in light of everything. To sum up, LIAR and REPULSIVE.
7311 2018-11-21 17:36:01 President trump do you not know how much it costs for oil exploration in this country? If oil isn't at 85 dollars a barrel the US companies and other oilfield contractors cant turn a profit.  Think about OKLAHOMA, no energy revenue, lower tax collection, no money 4 schools
7312 2018-11-21 17:36:01 You're negotiating oil prices with a murderer. You know he's guilty of ordering that murder. I'd rather pay higher prices for gas. You should move to Saudi Arabia you slimeball.
7313 2018-11-21 17:35:57 Let‘s see... I suspect Total, BP, Shell and Exxon will pump up and also with Iranian oil
7314 2018-11-21 17:35:57 Next to @GrumpySkeletor, @PerfumeAds has got to be the funniest Twitter feed I’ve ever come across. 

I’m laughing so hard I’ve just leaked oil over the shoes of a cop attempting to give me a ticket.

He’s real mad. Fuck him though… I’m bullet-proof
7315 2018-11-21 17:35:53 Unless your job is in the US energy industry.  I lost my 35-year job the last time SA turned on the tap to depress oil prices and put the US energy producers in their place.
7316 2018-11-21 17:35:52 Fact....Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
7317 2018-11-21 17:35:49 So the US control syrias oil fields and now trying to stop them importing oil
7318 2018-11-21 17:35:46 Oil of oregano. 2 drops sublingually 2-3x day for a few days. Natural Factors good brand at health good store
7319 2018-11-21 17:35:39 You Dope US oil production drives our price
7320 2018-11-21 17:35:35 When the general census is to separate you see why we are in this position. All for selling the resources at our disposal, we are good at getting oil out the ground but the word should be “innovate”. The bigger picture is screaming that disruptive technology will prevail.
7321 2018-11-21 17:35:29 Carrot seed oil
7322 2018-11-21 17:35:27 Today on alt-right twitter: "Blood and Oil".
7323 2018-11-21 17:35:24 I only make organic stove top popcorn with coconut oil and ghee. Then put tony chachere’s creole seasoning on it!
7324 2018-11-21 17:35:23 And he constantly insults our  friends in Canada and Mexico who actually supply more of our oil than Saudi Arabia. 
What's his REAL reason?
7325 2018-11-21 17:35:23 Donald Trump has just tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to 'a big Tax Cut for America and the World!' In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
7326 2018-11-21 17:35:17 I don't know how you find time to tweet between blowing Putin, getting anal from the Saudis, and cheating at golf. 
Maybe if you spent time on better policies, the market wouldn't be prepping for another crash. 

But sure... Oil prices.
7327 2018-11-21 17:35:15 Only 11% of oil imported to the USA comes from Saudi Arabia.
Our largest oil supplier is Canada at 40%.
7328 2018-11-21 17:35:13 What is WRONG with you?  We have oil...we are NOT dependent on SA.....you need to Hold SA accountable for Khashoggi's brutal murder..NOW
7329 2018-11-21 17:35:12 @ImranKhanPTI Take oil from Rs 70 to liters to 104 Now take the utility back to it at 70
 Take the internet there, where the poor is the benefit of you
7330 2018-11-21 17:35:11 Libs fight was on oil drilling & pipelines then think we have to stand up against Saudi ! It would be nice if we could have it all but world doesn't turn that direction.
7331 2018-11-21 17:35:11 It is also a revenue cut for US oil companies
7332 2018-11-21 17:35:09 Sooo...they are back to where they were when you took office. I don't suppose you took credit for the rise in oil prices. #MoronInChief
7333 2018-11-21 17:35:05 My car been begging my for an oil change so today I’m like fine bitch 
7334 2018-11-21 17:35:04 He's  lost it.  We are NOT needing their oil.  We have plenty of our own that we process and sell overseas.  Does that make sense.
7335 2018-11-21 17:35:02 @realDonaldTrump , all I can say is that here in Oklahoma, low oil prices is hardly good news for those who work in the industry. This generally means more lay-offs.
7336 2018-11-21 17:35:00 The claim forms part of the old narrative acc to which saudi stability (ie being a friend to the us) is essential to US power politics in the middle East and to keep the oil flowing, w/o price hikes etc
7337 2018-11-21 17:34:51 Dumpster Fire Donald: deals over death. Think of the deal he could cut if a few HUNDRED people bit it!!  Such a dealmaker!!  Oil prices at $5!!
7338 2018-11-21 17:34:51 @realDonaldTrump You are a spineless little bitch ... MSA had that man killed and because they might increase the price of oil you are backing down and letting them get away with murder ...#DONALDSGOTNOBALLS #TRUMPHASAVAGINA #MSACANKILLWHOEVERHEWANTSBECAUSEHEHASOIL
7339 2018-11-21 17:34:45 It’s cool that you killed an American as long as we have cheap oil am I right?
7340 2018-11-21 17:34:41 So the Saudis are trying to torpedo the US Shale Oil industry while deflecting attention from being busted for murdering an American journalist, and our #MoronInChief thinks this is a great thing?
7341 2018-11-21 17:34:39 And if we cut of SA I’m sure we could make up that difference from Canada, Norway and Mexico where most of the rest of out imported oil comes from. Note that the ~10% imported from SA drops even lower when considered as part of US total oil usage.
7342 2018-11-21 17:34:35 Why is it okay to get cheap products from Saudi Arabia and not Canada Europe and China? Saudis keep oil low to put United States oil producers out of business, let's boycott Sadi oil and buy American.!
7343 2018-11-21 17:34:31 Trump or are you trying to get control of Iraq oil by bolstering the Dinar with a get rich scheme there by eliminating Saudi Arabia from the picture you owe them Your family is in a very precarious position too owe them too much move to iraq they have a open kingship
7344 2018-11-21 17:34:29 I think you could definitely make the case that the slowdown in US manufacturing job growth of 2015-16, in part driven by the oil price slump, helped Trump in the swing states of the upper Midwest. Will be interesting to see how that dynamic plays out in 2020
7345 2018-11-21 17:34:23 There are some of us whose earnings are connected to the price of cruel oil.
7346 2018-11-21 17:34:19 I have found you to be quite fair/informative and only get negative when talking about the Oilers repeated mistakes.  Maybe considering how many times they have repeated mistake people assume you're always negative!
7347 2018-11-21 17:34:16 You ignore CIA report on death of Khashoggi and believe a ruthless dictator so that you can cheer low oil prices! You sold your own soul long ago...you just sold America’s soul! So sad! #truthaboutrump
7348 2018-11-21 17:34:15 If perhaps Trump hadn’t lifted the decades old ban on exporting crude oil, we could tell Saudi Arabia to piss up a rope and not worry about gas prices at all?

Yes. Let’s go to war but proceed with the billions in arms & buy oil.
7351 2018-11-21 17:34:11 Boyle oil lmao
7352 2018-11-21 17:34:10 Mr. President, oil prices always go lower this time of year. Global demand is going lower so producers will lower prices to attract buyers. Please relearn economics 101.
7353 2018-11-21 17:34:06 Maybe Canada should put some oil tariffs in place against the US until we get the message.
7354 2018-11-21 17:34:05 I put to much oil on  my nose burning so bad
7355 2018-11-21 17:34:00 なんか寝れぬ
7356 2018-11-21 17:33:59 back to that 2014 Cramer crap that stupidly cheap oil helps the consumer. BS!!!

Stable oil at reasonable prices HELP EVERYONE!
7357 2018-11-21 17:33:59 Let’s start pumping more in the #Bakken. More US jobs as a result. Screw #saudioil we don’t need it. We need more high paying jobs in our oil fields. @POTUS
7358 2018-11-21 17:33:58 The US is a major oil exporting country. Sad.
7359 2018-11-21 17:33:57 We have never had a tree nut (plain or with oil and/or salt) test at/above 5 ppm of gluten. All extractions have tested below the lower limit of quantification. Hope this helps. Happy Thanksgiving to you!
7360 2018-11-21 17:33:54 And our biggest oil supplier is Canada and SA has been trying to boost prices.
7361 2018-11-21 17:33:47 What low oil prices??? My gas and oil have been going up steadily! Is there anybody here on twitter who’s gas prices have been going down?
7362 2018-11-21 17:33:45 @realDonaldTrump   Don’t let oil prices fall to far. It’s going to hurt US production
7363 2018-11-21 17:33:44 There will be no where to run if this administration doesn’t start to accept climate change! You’re right about us all needing to stop relying on oil!!!
7364 2018-11-21 17:33:43 If you actually had a clue what oil prices might do, one of your sheep might listen. Try learning something before acting like you know.
7365 2018-11-21 17:33:41 Not unless you had a bunch oil & money & the most holy site. And if you didn’t crack wise on him & the family.
7366 2018-11-21 17:33:40 I’d rather stand with #Canada since we import almost 4x as much oil from them vs. Saudi Arabia.
7367 2018-11-21 17:33:39 Have you ever had chili oil? A spoon full will certainly wake you up...! Or knock you down.
7368 2018-11-21 17:33:39 My girlfriend asked if I prefer watercolour or oil portraits. I told her I won’t be drawn on the subject
7369 2018-11-21 17:33:37 Cover up a brutal murder for a lie about lower oil prices?
#BeBest
7370 2018-11-21 17:33:37 I changed my own oil yesterday & i put my own new coolant hose on today  #TomboyShit #ILikeWorkingOnCars 
7371 2018-11-21 17:33:36 Hey Saudi! How are you today? I know, we all know, you killed this dude. How about you lower oil prices and we will ignore it. Cool?
7372 2018-11-21 17:33:31 Actually he hasnt the slightest idea of what he is talking about. Oil prices would go down cause they would flood the market with crude destroying one of our key economy drivers im always amazed how democrats fit that much stupidity into a human body.
7373 2018-11-21 17:33:27 Tonight I’m finna go get my oil changed so I can get on the road
7374 2018-11-21 17:33:25 very patriotic mr. president, wow! 10% supplied oil from saudi arabia decreased the ptrice that way?! that’s more than ever, ever, ever, ever, and ever, and ever...uh... i can’t remember anymore what i wanted to write . maybe dementia, or maybe not . it is like it is .
7375 2018-11-21 17:33:22 i have been sitting on the fence so far (Trump good or bad), wow to sell your soul for a better oil price?
7376 2018-11-21 17:33:16 I'd gladly pay double that if it meant we weren't funding terrorists. Maybe if gas was extremely expensive, we'd start working toward more long-term solutions and get away from our dependency on oil.
7377 2018-11-21 17:33:14 Get palm oil out of the food chain. It’s in everything.
7378 2018-11-21 17:33:13 the funny thing about this is that US oil producers are not happy with lower prices.  He's so clueless that he's thanking SA for setting prices that ultimately hurt our own GDP.  what 
a moron.
7379 2018-11-21 17:33:13  I like it!  Went to Pot Doctor today. Gave me my medical Marijuana card and spent an hour with me telling me what she wants me to use. CBD oil daily under the tongue. Vapor inhaler. Crockpot recipe to condense 1 ounce of pot down to put in my food. She was very nice.

#LockHerUp
We only get 10% of our oil from SA, but your cult just laps it up...
#YourTimeIsUp
7381 2018-11-21 17:33:09 Better yet; we need to disconnect from oil fuel. 
The more alternative fuel sources we have in USA the more we become independent from oil producing countries. 
We have the technology & money for R & D. 
The oil companies lobby to keep us dependent on oil & $$$ profit for them.
7382 2018-11-21 17:33:07 Who is "they"? If "We" choose to replace palm oil, We can produce other fats. They do not of course have to be vegetable in origin, but we can grow some of the worlds finest oils here.
7383 2018-11-21 17:32:55 Damn, you got me. I guess we cant fix oil refineries. Were just america.
7384 2018-11-21 17:32:49 No, Georgetown, Guyana, where the Oil industry is exploring new oil beds wtih great success. 

Jonestown was in the middle of country. Not close to Georgetown, Guyana.
7385 2018-11-21 17:32:49 Quarter (or eighth) them, toss in olive oil, coarse salt, black pepper, maybe a bit of oregano, cover with tin foil and roast them.
7386 2018-11-21 17:32:46 Better yet; we need to disconnect from oil fuel. 
The more alternative fuel sources we have in USA the more we become independent from oil producing countries. 
We have the technology & money for R & D. 
The oil companies lobby to keep us dependent on oil & $$$ profit for them.
7387 2018-11-21 17:32:45 is Canada's economy is sostrong ..... why are they talking about a ressession in 2020?
this lie is as bad as the lie Trudeau told about the oil industry being in better shape now then it was 2 years ago.... do any of you liberals know how to tell the truth ?
7388 2018-11-21 17:32:43 Either Trump is stupid enough to think that we get most of our oil from Saudi Arabia, or he thinks his followers are.
7389 2018-11-21 17:32:43 We get all our oil from the US. The Saudi's are NOT giving us a tax cut. Just more lies.
7390 2018-11-21 17:32:42 You don't need to get a usd 70 whey protein bottle and pay another 2k for gym. Just eat a lot of healthy fats (olive oil, coconut, tuna), eat plenty of dark greens, plantains, yams, get into a body weight training program.
Look for local produce in the market. Not imported ones.
7391 2018-11-21 17:32:40 Also a president who doesn't understand these falling oil prices are the markets' way of signaling their lower expectations for the future.
7392 2018-11-21 17:32:38 Someone should do a quick pharmacokinetics study of what happens to statin levels when you take ~2g BID of mineral oil with your medications.
7393 2018-11-21 17:32:37 Wow! It's ok if they butcher Americans or people who live in America,  as long as they lower oil prices?  You really are a moron! #worstpresidentever #trumpIsHitlerJr #TrumpCrimeFamily
7394 2018-11-21 17:32:36 How is it better for Putin? He's not calling for an open relationship with them, he's tired of the constant escalation that's been going on since the cold war. We openly incest in Saudi Arabia with military and oil deals and we give them a seat at the HR department.
7395 2018-11-21 17:32:35 Canada supplies 40% of America’s oil. Only 11% is imported from Saudi.  
7396 2018-11-21 17:32:34 Did SA reduce the price of crude oil?
BTW: How much to the Saudi's contribute to the corrupt Clinton Foundation?
7397 2018-11-21 17:32:31 Blood for oil.

7402 2018-11-21 17:32:24 #DonaldTrump has just tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to 'a big Tax Cut for America and the World' In fact, #Canada is the #US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from #Saudi_Arabia #السعودية #خاشقجي
7403 2018-11-21 17:32:24 And if it’s dry, coconut oil makes a better gravy than KY
7404 2018-11-21 17:32:17 Some might argue that they high jacked a cause to get higher brand exposure. Positive action would start with them not selling the many products that contain palm oil. Now that would be taking a stand against the deforestation taking place.
7405 2018-11-21 17:32:16 I THINK THE SAUDI PRINCE WAS CLEANING HOUSE AND HE WAS SETUP TO MAKE IT APPEAR HE KNEW ABOUT IT AND WANTS TRUMP TO DO SOMETHING STUPID AND CREATE AN OIL FLOW PROBLEM . DEEP STATE CIA.
7406 2018-11-21 17:32:02 Better yet; we need to disconnect from oil fuel. 
The more alternative fuel sources we have in USA the more we become independent from oil producing countries. 
We have the technology & money for R & D. 
The oil companies lobby to keep us dependent on oil & $$$ profit for them.
7407 2018-11-21 17:31:56 Trump is backing the Saudis despite all of the evidence they are assassin's. He is putting Saudis first  and his business ahead of America. He is selling the soul of our country for oil and greed! He is making our country less safe, filling his pockets , Kushner in Saudi pocket!!
7408 2018-11-21 17:31:55 And Canada supplies most of the oil to the US....NOT Saudi Arabia
7409 2018-11-21 17:31:48 Saudi Arabia’s oil is way more important than one gay journalist. Do you want a $6 gallon of gas?
7410 2018-11-21 17:31:40 By going lower he wasn't necessarily talking about oil prices!
7411 2018-11-21 17:31:36 Oil for blood
7412 2018-11-21 17:31:27 You need to get out more Gary. I too live in Ontario and there are many of us that support Alberta. We actually realize that when Alberta gets there oil to market it benefits all Canadians not just alberta.
7413 2018-11-21 17:31:26 @mitchellreports Didn't a Saudi royal or minister threaten $150/bll oil prices if US sanctioned the country over the Russia/Israeli-style murder of a person on foreign soil?
7414 2018-11-21 17:31:25 We get ~11% of our oil from Saudi Arabia and they just murdered an American resident yet you send them a public thank you???? You must be getting a nice paycheck to be their personal PR agent.  It's unbelievable how you find ways to sink lower every goddamned day 
7415 2018-11-21 17:31:21 We're proud to say that we don't use any palm oil in our products nor do we destroy any trees.#savetheorangutans

7417 2018-11-21 17:31:14 Honey, your gonna need a lot more than just CBD oil
7418 2018-11-21 17:31:11 If we used renewable resources and were energy independent the cost of oil wouldn't matter! You're just happy they clipped a journalist. #PeeBrain
7419 2018-11-21 17:31:11 POS45 says we are the largest producer of oil. WE should dictate the price! He is really as despicable as they are!
7420 2018-11-21 17:31:11 The government of Turkmenistan has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Alexander Ludwig in a spandex wig.
7421 2018-11-21 17:31:10 It is a great start to your platform. I believe that in order to win you will need to declare your policies on Carbon Tax, and getting pipelines built to get Alberta oil out of the ground .
7422 2018-11-21 17:31:06 If the oil company's drilling for oil here in the US would stop selling oil overseas and leave it here it would be even less.
7423 2018-11-21 17:31:04 Lets just ignore the genocide we are aiding in Yemen for cheap oil, because someone else like a bad leader.

A broken clock is twice right.
7424 2018-11-21 17:30:59 YUCK! Bread look soggy as fuck. Full of grease, I can taste the oil through this picture.
7425 2018-11-21 17:30:59 So, we'll chop this man into pieces, and you look the other way. For that we'll give you a break on oil prices. Are you fvcking kidding me?
Revenge, violence, and most of all, MONEY, are all that you both understand. Go there, touch the magic globe, and never come back.
7426 2018-11-21 17:30:59 Wow,digital phrenology *lol*....I see snake oil is alive and well in the digital age. Next step:facebook buys company and sells the idea it can use this to accurately show which people on facebook are good targets for Russian trolling.....
7427 2018-11-21 17:30:51 Is oil a vital American interest or not? I'm all for exploring all of our resources here and cutting ties with the Saudis. Drill in Alaska. Build pipelines and refineries. We should be more self sufficient.
7428 2018-11-21 17:30:49 You are horrible and stupid if you think the Saudis set the price of gas at the pump. Oil is falling due to global factors beyond your understanding.
7429 2018-11-21 17:30:49 Yeah Shauny dumb things like health care and education hey. But hey man oil and gas real men like you don’t ever need a DR hey bro cause you suuuuuuperman 
7430 2018-11-21 17:30:48 Getting my oil changed and the man tried to tell me my blinker fluid was low. I’m a woman not an IDIOT. @Valvoline
7431 2018-11-21 17:30:47 You just reminded me I need an oil change damn. But thanks for the info
7432 2018-11-21 17:30:45 Right. So the story is: take our money to grow the company, then bail on Canada.

Right. And your story is defend oil over defending Canada. 

Understood.

7434 2018-11-21 17:30:36 And we don't even need their oil!
7435 2018-11-21 17:30:35 Time to cut Wall Street Commodity traders out of this product. Accounting for 25% of the cost of a gallon of gas & oil is COMPLETELY OUTRAGEOUS!!!!!!
7436 2018-11-21 17:30:28 I refuse to make it.  Instead, my green beans will be blanched and then sautéed in bacon fat and topped with bacon.  For veggie folks, I would swap out the bacon goodness for olive oil and toasted pecans.

7439 2018-11-21 17:30:24 Considering we get more oil from Canada then Saudi Arabia I think our gas prices should be fine.
7440 2018-11-21 17:30:23 Sounds like America in pathetic submission to Saudi Arabian oil and money, to me
7441 2018-11-21 17:30:22 This isn’t a wise tweet. You took another Trump lie about the drop in oil directly linking to the Saudis pumping more and amplified it. Delete this.
7442 2018-11-21 17:30:21 Narealize ko. Mukhang hindi matutuloy ang pagpaparevive ng BNPP at pagutilize nito dahil may agreement na with China na magexploit ng oil and gas sa West Philippine Sea. Ano connect? Ang radioactive waste disposal plan ay sa mga isla doon ilagay ang containers (radioactive waste)
7443 2018-11-21 17:30:14 And hey who cares if they kill a US resident? No biggie right as long as oil prices are lower..which in itself is another lie to unpack
7444 2018-11-21 17:30:11 Selling more Canadian oil just means the Middle East sells less oil and the  get less cheap oil from Canada.

24% of  carbon emissions come from transportation. Make regulations to increase mileage and incentives for electric vehicles.

#cdnpoli #Alberta
7445 2018-11-21 17:30:05 Oil will never be as low as what Trump is charging for America's soul. "For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what shall a man give in return for his soul?" - Matthew 16:26
7446 2018-11-21 17:30:03 Depends on the car and tires. But every 15-20,000 usually good enough. I get it with every oil change
7447 2018-11-21 17:30:03 Maybe some are getting the message, but I live in ND. Every thing Trump does hurts everyone from farmers to the oil industry here.  Yet I have seen not one step back from their support.
7448 2018-11-21 17:30:01 How about the love for Canada who supplies you with almost four times the amount of oil as Saudi Arabia? #Factcheck
7449 2018-11-21 17:30:01 Quid pro quo?....oil prices are dropping in anticipation of a slowing economy contributing to an oil glut, but sure, thank you Saudi Arabia for helping to normalize the slaughter of journalists...
7450 2018-11-21 17:29:55 Oil prices have not been over 60 since 2015.  60 was middle of 2017 under Trump.
7451 2018-11-21 17:29:54 This man at Midas just blessed me on this oil change price

7454 2018-11-21 17:29:49 Yes, but them Mexico isn't chopping US journalists into pieces and having our potus say hey it's ok! Neither is Canada and there's zero reasons we could not up our oil intake from Canada AND mexico (which btw we also get oil from).
7455 2018-11-21 17:29:48 Oil can continue to go down. Who doesn't like 1.50 per gallon? Less money, less expensive. More savings in your monthly budget.
7456 2018-11-21 17:29:45 Sign on the yard in the Arizona desert outside the air conditioned home, next to the three RVs, "NO MORE BLOOD FOR OIL"

7459 2018-11-21 17:29:43 Well if they lowered the oil prices the gas prices where I live haven't gone down so that's b*******
7460 2018-11-21 17:29:41 Not everyone views the world thru ONLY a MONEY prism.
Don't give a shit if oil is free.
I have a VERY different VALUE system and definition of PATRIOTISM from you.
7461 2018-11-21 17:29:31 You're ok with defending the Saudis because of oil. You have no morals.
7462 2018-11-21 17:29:30 Just read on CBC tweet, U.S. gets 40% of its oil from Canada and only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
7463 2018-11-21 17:29:24 Would US companies buy oil from a state sponsor of terrorism?
7464 2018-11-21 17:29:23 He tweets enjoy, like his actions resulted in the price drop. Our reality is that years of high gas & oil prices have negatively impacted tens of millions of households.
7465 2018-11-21 17:29:22 @seancullihall they posted 10 jobs this morning. Then @realDonaldTrump tweeted about Oil price again. Jobs cancelled. SAD!
7466 2018-11-21 17:29:22 well thats actually the consequence of bombing the shit out of nations for oil and gas pipelines, so u know, we are kind of reaping what we sow.
7467 2018-11-21 17:29:21 True. And WE supply most of our own oil. In past years, our crude production doubled while demand decreased. That spells an oil glut of our own making.
7468 2018-11-21 17:29:12 #JohnMcCain widow calls prez Chump "Negative Nancy".   His daughter calls him worse.  I call him "#DipshitDonald   How about supporting the Saudi prince who ordered the butchering of journalist?  ANYTHING for oil.  ps:  17 of 19 hijackers #9/11 were....wait for it:  SAUDIS!
7469 2018-11-21 17:29:11 So Saudi is not a part of opec and doesn’t have any influence on the world oil market? 

Think first before you post stupid headlines.
7470 2018-11-21 17:29:11 They were also given little amounts of placebo (mineral oil).
7471 2018-11-21 17:29:10 Um don’t we produce more oil here in the US than we import from KSA?  I think our neighbors to the north provide probably quadruple the oil for us that KSA does yeah? And I guess a drop in oil makes the reporters death “ok”?
7472 2018-11-21 17:29:08 Lick Me All Over oil will never get old, like ever.
7473 2018-11-21 17:29:06 @realDonaldTrump. LYING AGAIN about Saudi oil....#TrumpProtectionSyndicate/MbS

7475 2018-11-21 17:29:03 (But let's not get too carried away thanking Justin Trudeau for lowering global oil prices when we need to stop burning fossil fuels ASAP.)
7476 2018-11-21 17:29:02 Oil? Bitch you cooking?
7477 2018-11-21 17:29:02 Them come open some new joint for Coastal close to glory oil
7478 2018-11-21 17:29:00 I think your attitude consistently reflects how the team is doing. A couple of years ago, you were positive. Otherwise, in this decade+ of darkness, if honest, none of us can be really upbeat. “Oh boy, I think we’ll miss the playoff cut by less than six points!” doesn’t do it.
7479 2018-11-21 17:28:54 If we would focus on new pipelines in the Permian Basin we wouldn't need their oil and we could have $2.60 or less gas prices.
7480 2018-11-21 17:28:54 Thank you very much sir for bailed out us,our economy and our current regime,which are very sensitive to oil prices.
7481 2018-11-21 17:28:51 Yep just keep using that oil till its all gone no biggie.
7482 2018-11-21 17:28:50 Happy to see you can thank Saudi Arabia while turning your back on the neighbours to the north that over 40 percent of the countries oil is imported from
7483 2018-11-21 17:28:50 Never mind they murdered someone, is this why you won't condemn them.... Cause the provide you cheap oil
7484 2018-11-21 17:28:49 If you are worried about the rest of world economy, Trump would not have to sanction Iran oil, but then America first, right.
7485 2018-11-21 17:28:48 What price oil?
7486 2018-11-21 17:28:45 Lots of silence. Oh so much silence. Also silence on this morning’s stupid “thank you Saudi!” for low oil prices tweet. Sauds account for <10% of U.S. oil imports, Canada 40% (and doesn’t chop anyone up!) but he has his pals...

7491 2018-11-21 17:28:30 This Stones playlist on XPN is getting me geared up for an oil spill after work
7492 2018-11-21 17:28:29 If we have to look the other way at Saudi Arabia’s wars, terrorism, and gruesome murder of an American journalist because we fear oil being $150/barrel, maybe it is time to go with green energy.
7493 2018-11-21 17:28:26 When I worked for an oil giant, I was told oil going down was the end of the world.
Why does Trump hate American oil workers?
7494 2018-11-21 17:28:26 Dice, par boil, toss with olive oil and whatever herbs/spices you want, and finish in the oven at like, 425
7495 2018-11-21 17:28:25 No need to worry. This is not about oil or policy. This is a war on journalists so Sean, The Entertainer, will be safe (with the possible exception being Mueller).

7497 2018-11-21 17:28:23 @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @MELANIATRUMP @IvankaTrump OK enough with the encouraging the drop in oil prices.  States like Texas, OK, ad LA that supported you need oil $60~$70 pbb and that is certainly affordable for everyone without hurting producers.
7498 2018-11-21 17:28:19 A man’s life for a seasonal oil price reduction. That’s it?

7503 2018-11-21 17:28:05 Canada is our number one supplier of crude oil followed by Saudi. And yet, Trump has no problem bad mouthing Canada. Why? Follow the money. Trump’s business are flush with Saudi money. From a 2015 rally: “They pay me millions and hundred of millions."
7504 2018-11-21 17:28:02 Saudi Arabia supplies 11% of our imported oil, while Canada supplies 40%.  Shouldn't your thank you be to Canada? Guess they'd have to murder a journalist 1st.
7505 2018-11-21 17:28:01 41% haven’t had the greatness that is bacon brussel spouts, tossed in olive oil.
7506 2018-11-21 17:28:00 Yes Canada is @realDonaldTrump Largest Oil Provider
7507 2018-11-21 17:28:00 So low oil prices are worth all principles of decency, justice, liberty and human rights our country has stood for? I think your priorities are morally wrong! #AlternativeFacts
7508 2018-11-21 17:27:58 Angola has borrowed more than $19bn from China since 2004, mostly secured against oil.

7509 2018-11-21 17:27:56 The price of a barrel of oil is $54, according to tRump then the price of a journalist must be $54 then, oh yea , a down payment for a apartment in tRump tower too.
7510 2018-11-21 17:27:56 He wasn't an American citizen and you know damn well but it's way more than about oil prices.

7512 2018-11-21 17:27:53 I thought USA got most of their oil from Canada according to government website
7513 2018-11-21 17:27:52 Blood oil.
7514 2018-11-21 17:27:49 @TunjiAndrews I think this speaks to your fear of oil going lower.
7515 2018-11-21 17:27:41 When the leader of the free world takes the side of weapons and oil sales, I can't help but think of how many more innocent lives will be lost in the name of progress.
7516 2018-11-21 17:27:35 I love robotic oil poffins~!
7517 2018-11-21 17:27:34 Yo mama so fat that when she wear her spikey heels, she strikes new reserves of oil.
7518 2018-11-21 17:27:31 How very "Optimistic".  The OPEC nations could cut production today and raise the price of crude oil.  Yes, thank you Saudi Arabia.
7519 2018-11-21 17:27:30 If you check, the US is buying Canadian oil for about $20
7520 2018-11-21 17:27:29 Dig a hole on the ground and found black oil.  Not really black gold at $59/barrel.
7521 2018-11-21 17:27:26 Canada supplies more oil to USA than SA. 40%.
7522 2018-11-21 17:27:26 And win an expense trip to a far away island with no oil pumping platforms within a hundred miles n no climate deniers within 200 feet.
7523 2018-11-21 17:27:21 I’m getting flashbacks to 9/11 when Saudi oil > American lives. Again.
7524 2018-11-21 17:27:21 They do but then how they trying to be slick to a can of oil?????
7525 2018-11-21 17:27:17 If corn oil is made from corn and vegetable oil is made from vegetables. What is baby oil made from?
7526 2018-11-21 17:27:15 This requires a long term solution like allowing more oil production in the US to weaken OPEC’s grip on our economy.  Energy independence is the best response.
7527 2018-11-21 17:27:12 I HAVE A MESSAGES FOR PRESIDENT OF USA.BEFORE YOU TWEET ABOUT PAKISTAN THINK ABOUT IT. I HAVE A GOOD ADVISE FOR YOU, JUST STOP BLAMING PAKISTAN, BETTER OIL YOUR OWN MACHINE.
7528 2018-11-21 17:27:10 America 1776: "Death to the monarchy!"
America 2018: "It's super-okay if a foreign Crown Prince kills American citizens in exchange for oil and wealth. We wouldn't want to upset anyone."
7529 2018-11-21 17:27:05 @realDonaldTrump the art of the deal ? 

1) Saudi prince tortures & kills journalist 

2) Trump: if you drop oil prices to make me look like I know what I'm doing, we're all good on the torture/killing thingy
7530 2018-11-21 17:27:01 Canada is our #1oil supplier, plus,
Canada can easily replace the oil we imports from Saudi Arabia should relations with the Middle Eastern kingdom deteriorate to the point that trade in crude is halted, says an energy economist.
7531 2018-11-21 17:26:57 What percentage of oil do we receive from SA? I thought we received 40% from Canada, which trump treats like crap.
7532 2018-11-21 17:26:57 We are quite clear......as the source of 40% of your oil.....how America has come to view ......inexplicably. We don't have a clue why drumphs base hates us.....not a clue. We never bring bone saws to a meeting.
7533 2018-11-21 17:26:52 Wow - truly impressive what the president does not seem to understand about how basic things work. Lower oil prices would endanger US jobs - fracking for instance would not be economical under about $50. This would make the US more dependent on imports not less!
7534 2018-11-21 17:26:50 Time for an oil changeee cuhhhh
7535 2018-11-21 17:26:44 Trading human lives for lower oil prices much?
7536 2018-11-21 17:26:44 Since the US is a net exporter of oil, I say we use our own resources and not support those who murder reporters who are American residents with American citizen children...but that's just me.
7537 2018-11-21 17:26:37 Dulu pernah guna tea tree oil and sunflower oil as primer. Mmg nampak smooth dan glowing gila. Apa2 oil rasanya mmg akan bagi efek mcm tu. Or just me? Tapi lepas remove tu clog pores lah. Kbai
7538 2018-11-21 17:26:36 I thought it was America  first.... let’s use our own oil and lower our price.
7539 2018-11-21 17:26:34 If he kisses her forehead, no need of beard oil, enough oil for muruking meesai also
7540 2018-11-21 17:26:34 Yes but truthfully it wouldn't cost any more. the world oil market price structure isn't based upon the US position on butchering a journalist. #Kashoggi #FreePress and anyway it's time to change - #GreenNewDeal
7541 2018-11-21 17:26:32 And why does Trump REALLY defend the Saudis? 
We supply most of our own oil, followed by Canada, Mexico and Venezuela. But he insults and threatens THEM constantly.
7542 2018-11-21 17:26:32 The same people ok with raising our taxes to cover an extra 19mil to ban abortions are the same people who are ok with ignoring a journalist murder for lower oil prices. Ass backwards people.
7543 2018-11-21 17:26:28 Another couple dead journos and they'll pay us to take their oil maybe?
7544 2018-11-21 17:26:27 SA is the WORLDS largest supplier. USA imports 90k barrels a DAY from SA. Economists say if USA halts oil from SA oil will cost $200+a barrel. The worlds oil prices will decrease hurting US business Comcast,CNN MSNBC,CBC are advocating hurting Low income Americans with $10gal/gas
7545 2018-11-21 17:26:25 Yo opero el futuro del West Texas o Light Sweet Crude Oil CL), el multiplicador es x1000 USD y es el más contrato de petróleo más líquido, tienes también el mini (QM) que tiene un multiplicados x500 USD. Un saludo
7546 2018-11-21 17:26:17 Mostly devils advocate here as they haven’t really worked in our interest but, historical argument is we 1) want credible local threat to offset Iranian capabilities 2) steady oil supply to avoid a repeat of oil embargo in 70’s for political purposes that aren’t in our interest.
7547 2018-11-21 17:26:13 I guess you could say that they're taking a hacksaw to oil prices.
7548 2018-11-21 17:26:08 3) moisturiser 
~ Substitute your normal moisturiser for coconut oil . Again it makes your skin so much smoother. 

~ you can only use it on your nails . When your cuticles are dry. 

~ Use as a lip balm

7550 2018-11-21 17:26:04 That is a culture of death, because it is simply impossible to build a sustainable prosperous global civilization on low EROI sources like solar and wind.   Without and oil based global industrial infrastructure solar and wind would be unaffordable.
7551 2018-11-21 17:26:03 I read today that we get more oil from #Canada than #SaudiArabia. You wouldn't believe that was true from what #CrookedDonnie says and how he treats Canada.
7552 2018-11-21 17:26:01 Well the wait begins. New tires and an oil change this is hours of my life I won’t get back
7553 2018-11-21 17:25:58 Ugh why does oil change have to be so expensive
7554 2018-11-21 17:25:58 Aku make tea tree oil + tonernya the body shop! Ampuh bgt di akunyaaaa, magic pol! Malam diolesin, besoknya dah lumayan kering
7555 2018-11-21 17:25:57 @realDonaldTrump thanks #Saudi regime for keeping oil prices low, the same regime responsible for journalist's gruesome murder. This goes beyond selling values at the altar of money. Trump is now condoning mass murder. #Khashoggi
7556 2018-11-21 17:25:55 I mix almond oil with my cleanser and then Epimax to moisturize my skin is becoming better now
7557 2018-11-21 17:25:53 I won't buy your products again until you stop using palm oil!
7558 2018-11-21 17:25:51 Hey part of the world economic balance is the price of oil. Donnie, remember that when the price dips too low then extracting it in the states is unprofitable, and we end up buying more from the foreign markets! Duh...
7559 2018-11-21 17:25:50 Great for who? Look how much we lost in the oil market? Value down 25%. Billions lost because of you. Most are republicans,
7560 2018-11-21 17:25:48 Donald Trump just proved that the Saudi’s control what we are charged for oil ... it has zero to do with cost of refining it ...#SAUDIKINGISAKILLER #SAUDIKINGISAPIECEOFSHIT #MSAISGOINGTOBEBUBBABITCHINJAIL #IFYOUHAVEOILYOUCANGETAWAYWITHMURDER
7561 2018-11-21 17:25:47 Then stop using palm oil it’s that easy #PalmOilAlarmCall
7562 2018-11-21 17:25:46 The coward sold America’s soul for a barrel of oil
7563 2018-11-21 17:25:41 Beard Oil!  Duh...
7564 2018-11-21 17:25:40 Thank you to the nation from which we get about 1/4 the oil we get from Canada! Way to kill journalists and bomb civilians (and buy Trump properties)!
7565 2018-11-21 17:25:39 Trump came down harder on CNN's Acosta for asking questions than he did on the Saudi Prince for murdering a journalist. I suspect he feels a journalist life is worth less than a barrel of oil. #Khashoggi
7566 2018-11-21 17:25:36 夜の営業（）
7567 2018-11-21 17:25:35 I don't know, but not saying any thing about the killing of a journalist and instead being grateful that Saudi Arabia lowered the oil price seems pretty low already...
7568 2018-11-21 17:25:35 I agree with Ken. You are almost always the smartest guy in the room.  
7569 2018-11-21 17:25:34 Acting as president in June 2016, Osinbajo held an emergency security meeting at the State House in Abuja. In attendance were all governors of oil producing states, all the four Service Chiefs.#TheManOsinbajo
7570 2018-11-21 17:25:33 TOXIC TRUMP IS LYING ABOUT SAUDI'S - THEY ARE NOT GOING TO INCREASE THE COST OF OIL. THE SAUDI'S ARE ONLY ONE COUNTRY IN OPEC! THE BEST QUESTION TO ASK IS WHAT TRUMP IS GETTING OUT OF THE DEAL PERSONALLY? BECAUSE NONE OF IT BENEFITS U.S.
7571 2018-11-21 17:25:33 I had a button that said No Blood for Oil from back in the day, I kept it. I guess I am sadly wearing it again.
7572 2018-11-21 17:25:33 I'm the only person I know with a coconut allergy, and it seems to be in EVERY hair product for black hair. I'm kinda lucky though, because my allergy isn't severe, so I do still use a few wit
h it, but I'd never push my luck and use straight coconut oil.
7573 2018-11-21 17:25:30 Hi there, our fries are not suitable for vegetarians because they're cooked in the same oil as chicken ^KR
7574 2018-11-21 17:25:25 and likely why they are valued. You could not be more correct about data. It's why I always discount/ignore forecasts for top and bottom ranges. Especially in commodities, like $20 oil.
7575 2018-11-21 17:25:20 Yup i best find some indian or Arabic food and also take care that it must be cooked in vegetable oil.
7576 2018-11-21 17:25:15 @BAP_Bangyongguk @BAP_Himchan @BAP_Daehyun @BAP_Youngjae @BAP_Jongup @ZELO96 Goodnight ja jub jub 
7577 2018-11-21 17:25:05 1) Most our oil is domestic. Also Canada is our biggest source of imports by a huge margin. 
2) Energy independence is a myth in a global economy. Canada & Norway have been "independant" for decades yet global events still dictate their energy prices.
7578 2018-11-21 17:25:03 You know what's better than low oil prices? Mass transit, alternative fuels, and energy independence.
7579 2018-11-21 17:24:57 Why are they allies? They perpetrated 911 & killed 3k+ Americans. They supply <11% of our oil (CA sells us 40% & no problems disrespecting them does he. They're worthless to us. They buy Trumps apts. That's why he's doing this. Not America First
7580 2018-11-21 17:24:56 I thought we already got “the big tax cut” ???  Silly me......that was for all your cronie supporters and company’s.  As for oil at $55 a barrel, that’s no good for your journalist killing friends in Saudi Arabia.  You’re a hot mess.  Tan less. Read more you nimwit
7581 2018-11-21 17:24:53 Hey Draft Dodger you do realize we only get about 10% of our oil from the Saudis.
7582 2018-11-21 17:24:52 Petrodollar, they could start selling oil in EUR tomorrow, then who is going to fund the deficits? Macron was also quite malicious with his EU army tweet about protection from US!
7583 2018-11-21 17:24:52 The majority of our oil comes from CANADA, whom trump has insulted, berated, & alienated. 
Little comes from SA, who commits endless human rights violations & chopped up a journalist. Trump has congratulated, praised, & embraced them. 

America is officially in the upside down
7584 2018-11-21 17:24:48 Is everything all good in Oil Country now? @betamanic @Saad316
7585 2018-11-21 17:24:42 The alarming rates of wine, cheese, oil, and salt coursing through my body make missing Thanksgiving a little easier #iloveitaly

7587 2018-11-21 17:24:36 Yes who cares about the vicious murder of a journalist as long as we have cheap oil you are a disgrace as President and as a human being
7588 2018-11-21 17:24:34 All of your Republican friends in ND who are overusing oil taxes to balance the budget probably disagree!
7589 2018-11-21 17:24:34 In 2017, Canada was the largest foreign supplier of crude oil to the U.S., accounting for 43% of total U.S. crude oil imports and for 21% of U.S. refinery crude oil intake. Canada exported 3.3 million barrels per day to the U.S. in 2017.
7590 2018-11-21 17:24:32 When they mix oil with the blood of journalists it goes further... I’ll pay more to keep our values and morals. Please and thank you. #BeBest
7591 2018-11-21 17:24:29 This is the dumbest thing. I get they have to scramble and grab at every non-issue, but for fucks sake! Leave @elonmusk alone! Big oil should admit they lost and start turning towards alternative energy as a competition, not continue this bullshit game of paying people off.
7592 2018-11-21 17:24:27 Uh you know that Canada supplies four times as much oil to the US as the Saudis do, right? Inconvenient facts....

7596 2018-11-21 17:24:23 But-we-have-Lower-Oil-Prices
7597 2018-11-21 17:24:23 Hey Don.    supplies you with 40% of your oil imports versus 11% from Crown Prince MbS and his hitmen.   These aren’t ‘fake stats’.  Anybody in the Canadian media that you and MbS want to ‘off’?
7598 2018-11-21 17:24:22 Oil price nothing to do with saudi's...US Oil production & high mileage cars !!!
7599 2018-11-21 17:24:22 You couldn’t go lower if you tried.  You are willing to accept the torture and death of another human being in trade for low oil prices?  DISGUSTING!!!’
7600 2018-11-21 17:24:22 if you were smart, LoL, you'd sanction the Saudis for what they did to that journalist and get oil prices even lower.  but you'd need to be smart.
7601 2018-11-21 17:24:16 And only one journalist was chopped to bits while still alive in return for hundreds of millions of dollars of arms sales and low oil prices. Praise The Lord!!!!
7602 2018-11-21 17:24:14 It's all so simple for you to ignore the problems and compare it to the simplicity in using oil as compared to batteries. If it wasn't for oil we couldn't get these polluting solution's to oil consumption lol. Hypocritical and dismissive in a superior attitude but ignorant.
7603 2018-11-21 17:24:14 Are you thanking them for killing the journalist too or y’all worked out a deal for oil? RT @realDonaldTrump: Oil prices getting lower. Great! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World. Enjoy! $54, was just $82. Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let’s go lower!
7604 2018-11-21 17:24:12 if you were serious you would cut off Saudi oil, and use Canadian.
7605 2018-11-21 17:24:10 Prices got as high as they did because of your sanctions against Iran. Saudi Arabia overestimated the effect that would have due to the fact that demand for oil went down. Now they went probably too far the other way. There not going to go lower they're going to get higher.
7606 2018-11-21 17:24:10 How was I convinced to do more work that just an oil change today..

7609 2018-11-21 17:24:04 Essential oils are Fragrant Oils extracted from plants chiefly through steam distillation (eucalyptus oil) or expression (grapefruit oil)
7610 2018-11-21 17:24:03 BS! We produce more oil than them. You have no morales whatsoever!
7611 2018-11-21 17:24:02 We are producing enough oil here the US to never ever need to buy one drop from them.  In addition, North America: US, Mexico, and Canada have more than enough, thank you.  And, don’t forget, we can all produce more wind and solar energy to make up any shortfalls 
7612 2018-11-21 17:23:56 Unfortunately it's not the oil that's the problem it's the arms sales they spend billions on arms and munitions a year and while I am more then happy to stop selling arms to a brutal dictator it seems our lovely Republicans are not #VoteThemOut
7613 2018-11-21 17:23:53 What do you propose we do to Saudi Arabia you moron? Attack them? Kidnap the Crown prince? Take over their oil fields? This is all about your hatred for Trump. And, Trump can’t be owned by both Russia and Saudia Arabia at the same time. It’s not our business to police the world.
7614 2018-11-21 17:23:51 What was that about our Saudi friends? And we take their side against our own intelligence community? 85,000+one journalist – – lots of blood to go around. We have to have our cheap oil don’t we?
7615 2018-11-21 17:23:46 STOP VAPING CBD OIL IT DOESNT WORK AND YOU JUST SOUND LIKE A DIPSHIT
7616 2018-11-21 17:23:45 Lmao turns out that the Iceland palm oil advertisement was problematic after all
7617 2018-11-21 17:23:43 Your tone is consistent with results and informed by reality. That you are able to back up your opinions with logic is admirable. If anything I find you a little too optimistic about the team given the exhaustive mediocrity of the organization.
7618 2018-11-21 17:23:42 Oil prices getting lower. Great! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World. Enjoy! $54, was just $82. Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let’s go lower!
7619 2018-11-21 17:23:42 40% Of our import oil comes from Canada , 11% comes from Saudi Arabia. So Trump lies again.
7620 2018-11-21 17:23:42 STOP letting niggas with dirty finger nails play in your pussy  you had a UTI for 3 week & don’t know why...Cause you got backwoods, motor oil, weed flakes, mayo, ketchup & lemon pepper seasoning in you hoe 
7621 2018-11-21 17:23:35 Americans work hard for their oil, just see the millions of graves around the middle east.....
7622 2018-11-21 17:23:34 You know we get far more oil.from Canada than Saudi Arabia, right?
7623 2018-11-21 17:23:30 If the US had been raking the forests of Pakistan, it might have found Bin Laden sooner & not needed more oil from Saudi Arabia at a low price, which Trump thanks them for as his best friends who kill American journalists, most of whom will never be allowed in the White House
7624 2018-11-21 17:23:29 I expect our Adrian is keeping his powder dry like Tony as it’s best to see if it’s going to flow first
7625 2018-11-21 17:23:25 BTW he’s lying, hey Le Grand Orange how is the stock market doing? Been pretty quiet about that since it went in the crapper! And how is a significantly lower oil price going to effect the oil & gas industry in North America? Please learn something about economics!!!
7626 2018-11-21 17:23:25 Does he also know that the bulk of the oil is supplied from Canada and only 11% from Saudi Arabia?
7627 2018-11-21 17:23:25 And you are free to make any sort of justification you want. it's not worth saying murder of a US journalist is ok because oil. Doesn't work that way for me.
7628 2018-11-21 17:23:23 Man o man you are the POTUS and you don't even know who sets the price for oil or where the majority of our oil comes from. Everyone you open your mouth or tweet you prove to the world what an idiot you are.
7629 2018-11-21 17:23:19 Since we get 40% of our oil from Canada. I say No reason to Continue sleeping with murderers. Like my capitals?
7630 2018-11-21 17:23:18 Whatever helps ease your conscience. You would NEVER have afforded anyone else that kind of benefit of the doubt. 

He already told you in his tweet - oil.
7631 2018-11-21 17:23:12 @realDonaldTrump of course! I've been telling you for the longest his stupidity, his ignorance, his lack of enphaty, xenophobia, racism He put Saudi Arabia first by not condeming Kashogi's Murder Well is not like I didn't  tell you so! 15%of their oil & a Journalist was his prise
7632 2018-11-21 17:23:11 Who’s taken advantage of us? We’re the ones with military bases on foreign soil. We’re the ones who suck up the Arab oil fields. We take advantage of everyone, not the other way around
7633 2018-11-21 17:23:10 THANK YOU VERY MUCH

For your DE-REGULATION of the

THANK YOU President Trump for our

7634 2018-11-21 17:23:09 It’s not about oil, it’s about his personal business and what the saudis can do for him and his family
7635 2018-11-21 17:23:09 He’s lying about all of this but the truth is, he really doesn’t know what the truth is.  He could be bragging about US oil producing more than anybody but he doesn’t even know it.
7636 2018-11-21 17:23:08 Saudi Arabia does not equal OPEC. We supply most of our own oil, followed by Canada, Mexico and Venezuela. And Trump insults them constantly. 
Why is Trump REALLY defending Saudi Arabia?
7637 2018-11-21 17:23:06 Breaking: Putin installed temporary President works with murderous Saudi regime to manipulate oil prices as cover for acceptance of brutal murder & dismemberment of US resident journalist. And  brags about it. 
7638 2018-11-21 17:22:58 Then it also helps to go through and look at your tweets (including /excluding retweets).

Gregor accused me of being negative. Did a count of origonal tweets on Hockey for a period. 20 negative, 20 neutral or positive.

Not as bad as he made it out, but interesting nonetheless.
7639 2018-11-21 17:22:58 NNNNGH. FRIEND. I wish i could help you!! Changing oil is super easy and those places F you over so hard I'm so sorry T_T  Make DIY tutorial videos with me ao we can save das woild.
7640 2018-11-21 17:22:55 But oil prices! Or something...

7642 2018-11-21 17:22:53 It’s literally the feeling “someone” not me “yet hopefully” has when they bought a cheap ass few acres of land and coming to find out years later there’s an oil reserve underneath it.

~ coconut oil works miracles on your locks making them all glossy . Add a little onto the ends of your damp hair before drying 

~ You can also use this to shave your legs instead of shaving cream . It makes your legs so much smother !
7644 2018-11-21 17:22:26 I want @RSPOtweets to vote to ensure palm oil companies adopt ‘No #Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ #palmoil policies. I can’t bear to see our #rainforests & precious #orangutan habitat destroyed #RSPO #RT16

7647 2018-11-21 17:22:19 My oil container is successfully filled and thanksgiving is tomorrow boi I’m gonna do damage to my plate 
7648 2018-11-21 17:22:16 Giving MBS a pass on murdering a journalist and critic is inexcusable but from the point of view of U.S. strategic interests in the region it is (kind of) understandable. My question is what's Canada's excuse?  What's stopping us from instituting a complete arms and oil embargo?
7649 2018-11-21 17:22:15 Well said Tracy. Why are we still paying extraordinarily high gas prices? If oil is that much lower, gas prices should have dropped by a large amount. Nope...Trump takes care of big business and to hell with us!
7650 2018-11-21 17:22:14 So very true we get VERY LITTLE OIL from the Saudis.
7651 2018-11-21 17:22:14 Innocent children dying for low oil prices?! Sinful!
7652 2018-11-21 17:22:09 forgot to add bleeding (oil leakage) in list of your worries...
7653 2018-11-21 17:22:09 What about LDL, I took 1g per day OTC fish oil for 1yr, diet and exercise. My TG went down from 210 to 120, HDL around same 45 but my LDL went up ~110 to 144. After Reduce-it results I stopped taking OTC fish oil.
7654 2018-11-21 17:22:08 @IcelandFoods well done on your Palm oil free range. Thought I’d try your store and do an online shop. You seem to force us to use plastic bags. Is this the case?
7655 2018-11-21 17:22:07 Thank You Sir for doing the right thing. I suggest that anyone who disagrees should tally up their gas savings & reimburse the oil companies or STFU

7657 2018-11-21 17:22:05 Sure, and EXXON and Oil are the same thing too
7658 2018-11-21 17:22:03 We barely get any oil from the Saudis, they are just leaders in OPEC, which is such an outdated organization that we should just go to someone else for the 3% of our oil we get from them.
7659 2018-11-21 17:22:01 "Oil prices getting lower. Great! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World. Enjoy! $54, was just $82. Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let’s go lower!" Says trump. @Dora_Siliya @EdgarCLungu when are we likely to see reduction of fuel in #Zambia
7660 2018-11-21 17:21:58 AIts worth noting that the facility 4 jetties & quay structures of mass processing capabilites, now hold 4 an unlimited cap in the determination of fines, although currently this eflects oil, rather than data oils, like omega 3
7661 2018-11-21 17:21:57 wow, use a MURDER to benefit America??  you say that and remind me of my cat after killing a bird. strutting around with a barrel of oil in your mouth saying look at me look at me.
7662 2018-11-21 17:21:55 Actually that's false, the US gets most of it's oil from ourselves, sitting at nearly 40%. Then Canada, then SA.
7663 2018-11-21 17:21:55 I say buy Canadian oil & boycott Saudi oil. Build pipelines here. No to Saudi blood oil.
7664 2018-11-21 17:21:52 I have to head to Walmart for an oil change . And I reallllllly don’t have the money for it tbh. I’m so financially fucked the last couple of months.
7665 2018-11-21 17:21:46 He does not care about actual oil prices!! It is just an excuse!! He is embarrassing us all!! Need to be investigated!! 
Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up!
7666 2018-11-21 17:21:45 Nah, I’ve gotten irked by you once in awhile but you’re cool man.  I’m not perfect so I’ll get pissed off by anyone once and awhile.
7667 2018-11-21 17:21:42 Saudi Arabia supplies only 11% of America’s imported oil. Canada supplies 40%. Methinks the Saudis don’t affect the price of US gas very much at all.
7668 2018-11-21 17:21:36 Congratulations you've struck oil.....
7669 2018-11-21 17:21:32 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Oil may  be a near-record low, but  heating oil in Michigan is rising quickly. The  oil itself is low, it's the middle man/pass through cost that is putting heat out of the reach many budgets. HELP!
7670 2018-11-21 17:21:30 Canada is by far the greatest provider of foreign oil to the US.
7671 2018-11-21 17:21:28 @ProcterGamble when will you stop using palm oil in Ariel - I was shocked to hear that my favourite washing tablets are responsible for deforestation.
7672 2018-11-21 17:21:25 Hope youve increased or bought back at this bargain price.   
7673 2018-11-21 17:21:24 B/c the roster was so flawed and unless you were getting rid of both, it would look silly. By doing it in season, it allows for some of yhe attention to be taken away from the GM
7674 2018-11-21 17:21:23 Bitches be so mad about shit That happened over a year ago. Bitxh that 1600 been chalked to the game. Car been outta commission for over 3 months but I’m still the forefront of your anger. Like wtf I had the car one week then it broke down my fault ? But I put the oil in it 
7675 2018-11-21 17:21:21 Uh oh. And Trump might actually care unless that island exports enough oil...
7676 2018-11-21 17:21:14 So you condone the murder of an American resident (legal) for the sake of lower oil prices!!
7677 2018-11-21 17:21:14 40% of oil imported into the US comes from Canada and only 11% from Saudi Arabia. Could you possibly get any dumber
7678 2018-11-21 17:21:12 According to Trump oil prices have fallen from $82 to $54 a barrel.  Is that the price of one man's life in Trump world?
7679 2018-11-21 17:21:11 Who are you speaking to? Your cronies at your golf club and Cabinet? During Obama years price of oil low $40s and your tax cut did nothing for the people. Have you seen the grocery price lately?
7680 2018-11-21 17:21:11 Low gas prices? -the price being, the dead & dying from 9/11 attacks, genocide in Yemen,  a murdered journalist,  list be long -would seem oil price pretty damn high @realDonaldTrump @GeorgeWBush__   @  y’all Thanking Saudi Arabia for that? What price your souls go for?
7681 2018-11-21 17:21:08 btw 100% of oil income is more than 9% no matter how much a barrel costs.
7682 2018-11-21 17:21:08 Extra spicy olive oil.
7683 2018-11-21 17:21:07 Perhaps this reliance on Saudi oil isn't the best thing for MAGAing. If only there were alternative sources of energy...maybe even ones that didn't destroy the planet.
7684 2018-11-21 17:21:06 Clement Attlee carpet bombed Malaya with Agent Orange, sent warships to Iran when they nationalised their oil, oversaw the ethnic cleansing of 400,000 Palestinians, partitioned India resulting in millions of deaths & waged war on Korea with the US. Very kind and gentle?
7685 2018-11-21 17:21:05 Imagine that?  @realDonaldTrump  policies created some of the largest economic growth we’ve seen in over a decade which would naturally lead to higher oil prices due to spike in demand, yet his energy policies has kept fuel costs near Obama recession levels?  The man is amazing!
7686 2018-11-21 17:20:57 Lol, Saudi's played the Trump admin and entire global oil markets for fools.  Baahahaa.. if OPEC cuts production, hello $100+ bbl!
7687 2018-11-21 17:20:57 #Brent: $64.15 (2.59%)
#WTI: $55.52 (3.91%)
EUR/USD: 1.14 (0.14%)
USD/RUB: 65.66 (-0.53%)
UAH/RUB: 2.36 (0%)
EUR/UAH: 31.69 (0.01%)
USD/UAH: 27.71 (-0.14%)
7688 2018-11-21 17:20:53 Put another way, I'm sure if this team had won 3 championships in the last four years you would be absolutely insufferable. 
7689 2018-11-21 17:20:46 A glass of sea water with oil spill
7690 2018-11-21 17:20:40 You know that the US is the largest energy producer in the world, right?  Lower oil prices means lower profits for millions of Americans in the energy business.
7691 2018-11-21 17:20:35 Moving money around so I can afford gas,weed,thanksgiving shit,oil change,and other shit 
I’ve never stretched money like this before I’ve peaked as an adult 
7692 2018-11-21 17:20:33 I am one of them simply because i react to almost every cream i use. So i dont bother except during harmattan then i manage coconut oil.
7693 2018-11-21 17:20:29 You want to compare Nigeria with the rest of the world, but when I compare with similar countries you cry foul.

Fine.

The answer is because our economy is heavily dependent on oil, so sustained low oil prices didn't let us rise when the rest of the world did
7694 2018-11-21 17:20:28 Talk to Canada. We import more oil from them than from Saudi Arabia.
7695 2018-11-21 17:20:28 Alberta oil is selling nearly $40/bbl less than WTI, and 50 less than Brent. So the savings  to the USA is YUUUGE.

CBC does not understand fungible commodities. If Saudi was not keeping world oil prices down, Alberta oil would be more expensive.
7696 2018-11-21 17:20:26 Funny. 40% of american oil comes from Canada vs 11% from the Saudis.
7697 2018-11-21 17:20:24 Yeah so basically if you have a rice cooker, I usually put 3 1/2 cups of rice and then fill the water to the 6 cup line. Then add oil to prevent sticking and salt for flavour, then stir and then press the white rice setting. No other prep necessary.
7698 2018-11-21 17:20:21 Good evening, Briony. Audi Centres offer a complimentary vehicle health check ahead of any winter journey, looking at key areas like your oil level. We'd advise you to contact your local Audi Centre and book an appointment for this.
7699 2018-11-21 17:20:19 New Mexico's Land Commissioner has the authority to sell and lease nearly 4.9 million acres of land, much of it rich with oil, natural gas, grazing land, and old-growth forests, without asking permission from the governor or the state legislature.
7700 2018-11-21 17:20:16 i like Joe but telling Brian oil is rigged is like telling him his career is just a charade 
7701 2018-11-21 17:20:15 now i don't feel bad about writing a diy cbd oil toothpaste blog
7702 2018-11-21 17:20:13 Nice sentiment but I don't like the idea of shaving the entire top layer of Alberta off just to wring it out for oil for the Americans.
7703 2018-11-21 17:20:11 Being honest is not negative.  There’s a difference.
7704 2018-11-21 17:20:01 So the water flows down to the south by itself, the oil taps will be manned in WM and energy is for free.
Have you ever wondered why Scotland pays WM for its own energy, and pay more for it than people do down south !!
7705 2018-11-21 17:20:01 Lower oil prices don’t help us? That makes us THEIR bitch? Happy thanksgiving!
7706 2018-11-21 17:20:00 You are frank and have high expectations relative to one's responsibilities.
7707 2018-11-21 17:20:00 I remember the oil embargo in the seventies. Long lines just to get gas. But that was a different patriotic time and people were both patient and understanding.

But this? Money over human lives? This was a contract killing and MSB went to Trump to get his approval.
7708 2018-11-21 17:19:55 En #nuvoil como parte de la industria #Oil&Gas en México, contribuimos al Objetivo 5 (equidad de género) de los #GlobalGoals impulsados por la ONU
7709 2018-11-21 17:19:49 Saudi Arabia supplies only 11% of our oil, Canada supplies 40%.
7710 2018-11-21 17:19:48 We hear you. This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years.  We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
7711 2018-11-21 17:19:45 Bro I been in this damn Chevrolet place for almost 3 hours. It doesn’t take that long to change some mf oil 
7712 2018-11-21 17:19:42 Garnier oil infused. Udh nyoba punya temen yg nivea lbh mantap garnier ternyata
7713 2018-11-21 17:19:41 Mexico supplies more of our oil than Saudis, but he insults them constantly.
7714 2018-11-21 17:19:36 Dismember journalists living in States on foreign soil, starving tens of thousands of babies in war. No worries as long as oil prices stay down and gun money keeps flowing. I hope next wave of angry jihadist won't be breeding from your actions in Jemen. #americafirst
7715 2018-11-21 17:19:34 are you expecting xmas shoppers to buy oil on black friday?
7716 2018-11-21 17:19:29 I use Honda CRV 04..My engine started to Short oil after  service 3 wks ago I got dis code after scanning PO325, PO141, PO135
7717 2018-11-21 17:19:25 Trudeau still allowing oil from Saudis to Irving. Keep propping up Little Dicktator
7718 2018-11-21 17:19:23 
7719 2018-11-21 17:19:16 Sorry since when does the Chinesr government start to be an international oil company? No my assesment still holds true no oil company is lining up to spend their money here. Ive been in the industry for 26years and can tell you first hand their is very little desire to invest.
7720 2018-11-21 17:19:16 The US gets more oil from Canada than Saudi Arabia lots more.
7721 2018-11-21 17:19:14 Saudi is only 9% of our oil Canada is 40% of our oil yet he is so nice to & thanks Saudi yet he is horrible to Canada and @JustinTrudeau ?? Ridiculous @realDonaldTrump
7722 2018-11-21 17:19:11 Sorry Rep. Swalwell, gas is 2 expensive now. And, havent we been on track every year reducing foreign oil imports?
7723 2018-11-21 17:19:10 If you dropped the price of a barrel of oil by $30, you could do whatever you wanted
7724 2018-11-21 17:19:09 as i suspected, a whole lot of them cheeses could be left out and should not be together. a lot. all that salt and oil/fat sounds like a mess. 
7725 2018-11-21 17:19:08 what a pathetic person taking credit for falling oil prices as if he had something to do with it
7726 2018-11-21 17:19:08 I need new oil cleanser 
7727 2018-11-21 17:19:07 Only 11% of our oil comes from the Saudis! 40% from Canada
7728 2018-11-21 17:19:01 Though, as oil is a commodity, it is the world market that sets the prices. The expected consumption is expected to fall. That in part due to prospect of worsening world economy, where fear of trade wars is one strand. 

So Trump should give thanks to Trump. He'd like that.
7729 2018-11-21 17:18:57 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇
7730 2018-11-21 17:18:56 Oil is an international industry that is more public than private worldwide. Even in the US, oil companies are heavily subsidized.
7731 2018-11-21 17:18:45 His motives for the tweet are irrelevant. I simply aim to set straight the misinformation that will be spread. People will point to canada as if WHERE we get our oil from is relevant. All thats relevant is who is setting the lowest price. Others will match it if they want to sell
7732 2018-11-21 17:18:40 @JoyVBehar @WhoopiGoldberg so he thanks Saudi for reducing oil prices? my country -Canada supplies 40% of the US oil...you’re welcome Orange...
7733 2018-11-21 17:18:40 Oil is the life blood. Of current and emerging economies buy. The cheap. Stocks. Trade and hold a position. America. Is. Aggressive  will only lead to conflict. Coming
7734 2018-11-21 17:18:38 To replace palm oil we will have to grow other plants to source vegetable oil from. Therefore it can only be assumed they will increase production of these.
We are not talking local here we are talking global.
7735 2018-11-21 17:18:37 Get on your plane and fly to Midland - Odessa and see why we have $52 oil. Thank West Texas not Saudi Arabia.
7736 2018-11-21 17:18:37 Worst decision when it comes to oil mining.
7737 2018-11-21 17:18:36 11. Snake oil salesman gotta keep moving.
7738 2018-11-21 17:18:35 Watch your Oil Industry get overloaded with MIGRANT WORKERS! Prove me wrong in a couple of years!
7739 2018-11-21 17:18:32 Plus, does he not know that Saudi Arabia supplies only 8-9% of our oil?
7740 2018-11-21 17:18:27 So in actual fact oil prices go up and you deploy family members to write off a brutal murder ~ you’re fooling no one mate.
7741 2018-11-21 17:18:22 In Houston, the U.S. oil capital, shale executives are trying out different superlatives to describe what’s coming. “Tsunami,’’ they call it. A “flooding of Biblical proportions’’ and “onslaught of supply’’ are phrases that get tossed around.
7742 2018-11-21 17:18:21 Energy analyst Pavel Molchanov on @CNBC's Power Lunch at 1:30p.m. ET today to discuss the drop in oil prices. Will keep dropping? Which oil stocks to watch? Find out with Pavel today.
7743 2018-11-21 17:18:19 In reality, Canada is the largest supplier of oil imported into America at 40%, with Saudi Arabia at 11%. And we don’t murder journalists we don’t like. 

Probably because we’re too busy scuffing up our American bought sneakers to smuggle into Canada.

You’re welcome, Donald.
7744 2018-11-21 17:18:13 As a noted national security risk and with foreign trade negotiators Trump doesn't like, he should immediately slap a steep tariff on Canadian oil!

7748 2018-11-21 17:18:00 Oil supply 40% from Canada, 11% from Saudi Arabia. You would think he would know that.
7749 2018-11-21 17:17:58 People keep tweeting that they'd pay more for gas if Trump would stand up to the Saudis.  I know they're being facetious, but many may not.  A better tweet would explain that Saudis benefit from trade, we buy more oil from Canada, and we shouldn't compromise on human rights.
7750 2018-11-21 17:17:58 Oil prices have been rock bottom, Donald...without ur help..

7766 2018-11-21 17:17:23 Well first Canada’s provides the US with the bulk of the oil. Secondly trumpy is trying to make it look like -see the saudis are good to us! We are good to them because we don’t care if they tortured and mutilated a journalist who lived in the US! We’re good

7769 2018-11-21 17:17:17 Gas prices usually drop during winter months due to less winter travel. But don’t worry they’ll raise home heating oil prices.
7770 2018-11-21 17:17:09 Flash! Oil up $2+. There goes our tax cut. Geesh!
7771 2018-11-21 17:17:07 Not that you care about facts BUT, the US only imports 11% of it's oil from Saudi.  You get 40% from Canada.  Canada - that country that you accused of being a national security threat.  I guess if Canada arranges to have a journalist murdered, you would have more respect for us.
7772 2018-11-21 17:17:05 If every Democratic country in the world placed an embargo on importing Saudi Arabia  crude oil it would hit Saudi Arabia  where it hurts most for them not us.

7775 2018-11-21 17:17:01 Only you would brag about oil prices on the murdered remains of a storied journalist. The Saudis are many things to the world but to U, personally, just another cog in your destructive wheel of self promotion and personal wealth. The twists in your mind are stunning. #NotMyPOTUS
7776 2018-11-21 17:17:00 Rich in both natural gas and oil, the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas has become one of the most prolific shale plays in the United States.
7777 2018-11-21 17:17:00 A 'parallel OPEC' (Russia + KSA) would have huge control of oil market (quality of their crudes vs. market demand), very significant military power, potential for additional allies in the Gulf region... Trump's pushing them around could be the incentive for its creation.
7778 2018-11-21 17:16:59 Are you kidding me, you are trading an American life for low oil prices! Just what we want an effing idiot for a so-called president who doesn't care at all about the citizens of this great nation or troops. You care more about the Saudi's than you do our military or free press!
7779 2018-11-21 17:16:58 You fool you buy 40% of the oil from Canada 
7780 2018-11-21 17:16:57 Don’t forget that one of the envoys was a vocal opponent of the oil sands.
7781 2018-11-21 17:16:57 From @CBCnewsalerts Donald Trump has just tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to 'a big Tax Cut for America and the World!' In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
7782 2018-11-21 17:16:55 Trump, Kushner, SA, Israel, UAE, Russia, Qatar, money, loans, laundromat, oil, Putin etc etc. Crooks are running our government and with the Trump tax theft bill, stealing from our treasury. Trump bankrupting our country like he bankrupted his businesses 6 times..
7783 2018-11-21 17:16:54 If we have to look the other way at Saudi Arabia’s wars, terrorism, and gruesome murder of an American journalist because we fear oil being $150/barrel, maybe it is time to go with green energy.
7784 2018-11-21 17:16:53 Canadian steel is keeping steel price low. China is keeping prices of all goods even lower. No thank you because there's no prospect for Trump Shanghai & Trump Toronto has gone under? Low oil prices is taking away American oil jobs 
#TrumpBullShit #TrumpCrimeFamily #DotardTrump
7785 2018-11-21 17:16:53 You cannot buy America's soul with oil. #JamalKhashoggi
7786 2018-11-21 17:16:51 RIP Khashoggi. Sick that you sold a life for oil.
7787 2018-11-21 17:16:49 Are you truly so ignorant of energy development in the shale fields in the USA? Do you not know that without the oil production in the Permian Basin that Saudi Arabia would have a stranglehold on oil pricing? Are you that uninformed? Have you read anything since 1980? Ignorant.
7788 2018-11-21 17:16:49 I thought you said we didn’t need foreign oil???
7789 2018-11-21 17:16:46 Remember we are supposed to be reducing our need for foreign oil idiot?
7790 2018-11-21 17:16:43 And apparently he's pleased with a lower oil price from saudis.
7791 2018-11-21 17:16:42 When it comes to personal weaknesses, being talked into adding purchases on when I just came in to get an oil change would be at or near the top of the list.
7792 2018-11-21 17:16:37 You've summed up the moving parts and bearing in mind that “a committee is a group of the unwilling, chosen from the unfit, to do the unnecessary”, I fear the worst but think the oil/ZAR moves have bought us some time. Hold! Double or nothing of what though? Christmas lunch?
7793 2018-11-21 17:16:36 I was told 4 years ago by API's top lobbyist that they would give us E10, but we would never get more than that!!! They are trying to prove their point now. Consumers need to start seeing the monopoly the oil industry has had and stop believing their propaganda against Biofuels!!
7794 2018-11-21 17:16:34 let's get this bread 
7795 2018-11-21 17:16:34 attach the condensation. remove the oil. combine the pneumatic vacuum and the chief. combine the adapter and the .
7796 2018-11-21 17:16:31 Saudi is transitioning away from oil, and isn’t the US the current leading in oil production?? So what he is saying is, big oil is about to raise gas prices to float their profit margins!
7797 2018-11-21 17:16:30 as soon as everyone hears I fry them its the same bunch of jokes about explosions. Which is because I guess a lot of people drop a frozen turkey in the oil. They probably try to bake without thawing too but with less chaotic results
7798 2018-11-21 17:16:29 good old donnie, murder just fine, torture a ok...as long as oil prices go down.
7799 2018-11-21 17:16:23 It’s almost 2019 and I still can’t schedule an oil change online..
7800 2018-11-21 17:16:18 With World crude oil prices plunging, why is the price of gasoline NOT going down? A simple answer... GREED!
7801 2018-11-21 17:16:16 From what I’ve seen this morning the crude supply and stockpiles are up but the supply of refined products like gas is down. Some analysts think that the market oversold oil but others think this is a dead cat bounce
7802 2018-11-21 17:16:15 Nothing’s better than having your oil pen sitting out when your brother drops by with another cop 
7803 2018-11-21 17:16:14 I took my cbd oil for the second time since the UK trip and forgot how much it helps me.. had an insane day at work but I stayed calm & happy & life is glitter and bubbles 
7804 2018-11-21 17:16:09 It’s. Going. To make him money.  Buy oil cheap.,start a war. Restrict. Oil in the gulf. And domestic oil will shine. Buy now. Sell in spring. When. He possibly starts shit. With Iran
7805 2018-11-21 17:16:08 These dudes predate christianity by over 50,000 years. And, tbh, the only reason they are still there is because the rest of the world doesn't think there is anything of value on their islands. Let somebody think there's oil there and they'll be wiped out, too.
7806 2018-11-21 17:16:04 Saudi oil in the USA is 11% of the USA market...Canadian oil is 40% of the USA market.... WTF are you talking about?
7807 2018-11-21 17:16:01 Fake 45 rs barrel crude oil.
Rsp must be 50rs for petrol diesel.
7808 2018-11-21 17:16:00 Gas prices are still to high!! When will they start dropping now that the oil price is down?
7809 2018-11-21 17:15:56 I just need @oyinhandmade to do a version of Honey Hemp without coconut oil. For the good of us all with coconut allergies

7813 2018-11-21 17:15:49 OPEC’s bad dream only deepens next year, when Permian producers expect to iron out distribution snags that will add three pipelines and as much as 2 million barrels of oil a day.

7817 2018-11-21 17:15:41 Mr. President,
You're 100% my President. I have questioned a couple of you decisions. Every time I have been wrong, but I don't feel great about trading a man's life for lower oil prices. Maybe it's just me, but this is a red line. I know you have "The Big Picture".
7818 2018-11-21 17:15:37 US oil and gasoline doesn’t even come from the Persian Gulf. It is mostly Canadian and Altin America. We get similar quantities from Africa as the entire Persian Gulf
7819 2018-11-21 17:15:35 Algae oil is 25 years away from being commercially viable on a mass scale. If you use the different oils available to don't eradicate the problem you just move it somewhere else. Whilst I agree with you. It's not that simple
7820 2018-11-21 17:15:34 Well oof it's 1am and I'm swishing sunflower oil in my mouth cuz apparently it can prevent my cavity from getting bigger/start hurting and yuck the texture is gross but the flavor is pretty ok tbh
7821 2018-11-21 17:15:33 @realDonaldTrump is so #IGNORANT! Saudi Arabi supplies only 11% of US oil imports. The traitor #trump praises the Saudi Royal family despots. Canada supplies 40% of US oil imports. The #ILLEGITIMATE #IDIOT @POTUS insults Canada Canadians & PM Trudeau! Despicable!

7823 2018-11-21 17:15:24 Trying to justify your support of a murderous regime with  incorrect oil prices.

Lagta hai Ashok Ghalot ne oil bhi use nhi kara Sachin Poilat ke sath
7825 2018-11-21 17:15:09 @realDonaldTrump is a traitor to American values. We do not need oil so bad that we do not stand up for human rights. Shame on treasonous trump. You are a disgrace to America.
7826 2018-11-21 17:15:08 Thanks Obama! Cutting our dependance on middle eastern oil strengthened our global position.
7827 2018-11-21 17:15:02 @TheDailyShow 40% of US oil comes from Canada. 10 to 15% from Saudia Arabia... frig you Eh!
7828 2018-11-21 17:15:01 I can’t even imagine the number of people who work in the oil industry who are either going to see a huge drop in wages or see their job disappear because of this huge drop in oil prices. This self proclaimed stable genius is creating a lot of instability.

7830 2018-11-21 17:14:59 Lesson learned - don’t let your oil tank run out of oil and expect it to be delivered the same day like it has in the past.. cold one tonight 
7831 2018-11-21 17:14:59 Support the deregulation of #Nigeria's oil industry?

Flagging to @DrJoeAbah @skyburz
7832 2018-11-21 17:14:57 Saudi Arabia is a radical, primitive, savage society. Other than oil which will one day run out they be got nothing to contribute (their regime) to humanity. 

But at least they can say the oil bought them a US President - even if it is the most corrupt one.
7833 2018-11-21 17:14:55 So #Dotard @realDonaldTrump thanks the Saudis for low oil prices in exchange for killing an American journalist. #Maga
7834 2018-11-21 17:14:54 Saudi Arabia tried to cripple Canada’s oil industry by slashing prices & boosting supply. Saudi Arabia is a competitor & a foe that fuels radical Islam.
7835 2018-11-21 17:14:53 Of course they are material people or their POTUS .... cheap oil
7836 2018-11-21 17:14:50 So much LOVE! So much baby oil! So much hairspray!
7837 2018-11-21 17:14:49 Should we not try to lead this new industry rather then let other countries be ahead of us? Again would bring a new industry to the us. Yes it wouldn’t be easy to cover the energy demand immediately but nothing’s ever but should help us get off the dependence of oil.
7838 2018-11-21 17:14:43 Couldn't agree more
7839 2018-11-21 17:14:37 Historically that's has been Saudi Arabia role balancing world oil markets as largest producer. Fair speaking..
7840 2018-11-21 17:14:36 Per AAA gas prices have gone up by $.43 since Trump became President. So being friends with the Saudis help's the oil companies.
7841 2018-11-21 17:14:34 So stupid. Oil prices are up significantly from when you took office.

A true coward uses “complexities” as an excuse to not do the right thing.

History will record you as the worst president ever. It will take years for America to recover it’s greatness.
7842 2018-11-21 17:14:31 Maybe I didn’t put enough but I didn’t want it watery..I did a protein one before with olive oil, eggs and mayo and that made my hair feel rubbery
7843 2018-11-21 17:14:31 But the oil price fell so he thinks thats a fair trade
7844 2018-11-21 17:14:22 Thanks for what, exactly? The despicable, horrendous murder of a Washington Post journalist, or not cutting oil production?

It's always money over lives with you, isn't it?
7845 2018-11-21 17:14:15 Actually, you nitwit we get most of our oil from Canada (40%)Thank You Canada I’m sure you are upset you were not mentioned but first you have to chop up an American journalist . Tiny only tweets to those he loves.
7846 2018-11-21 17:14:14 40% of oil comes from 11% from Saudi Arabia... maybe we should turn off the valve and see what happens
7847 2018-11-21 17:14:13 He’s one of those who would actually purchase chubbie shorts & drives a 2013 Dodge Dart with a marketing degree and can’t check his oil in his car. So probably from his other circle jerk friends 
7848 2018-11-21 17:14:13 You’re sstupid, SAU only supplies 11% of oil used in US, Canada supplies 40% as well as other goods.  You let murders slide and start shit with our closest ally.  You’re beyond dumb and have passed into mindless.
7849 2018-11-21 17:14:11 This MF thanking SA when the USA is the biggest supplier of oil in the world. How about we just don't sell it and keep it?  Be much cheaper then dumbass. And we don't need to kill journalists for cheaper oil....
7850 2018-11-21 17:14:09 A friend in Saudi feels oil will go down. Obviously he knows more as he stays near the oil.
7851 2018-11-21 17:14:09 Wrong on so many levels- including the fact that Saudi Arabia doesn’t set oil prices. Surely @POTUS knows this. Right?
7852 2018-11-21 17:13:58 This man has no conscience 

Blood for oil now ?

Just when we all thought he couldn't go lower as a human being  ....... boom !

Are we allsupposed to be grateful.. is that what he expects ??
7853 2018-11-21 17:13:49 I'm honestly interested in the general consensus of my perceived tone on here.
7854 2018-11-21 17:13:49 Having a truck ain’t cheap.  $210 for an oil change and maintenance. 
7855 2018-11-21 17:13:41 ...But their oil prices!

7858 2018-11-21 17:13:37 @realDonaldTrump You worked so poorly that small countries such as Turkey, Iraq were bullying the United States, the Pompeo only pars and severely lowered American power. The other sanctions are not important to us, the only sanctions that are important is the boycott of oil,
7859 2018-11-21 17:13:35 Castor oil nigga
7860 2018-11-21 17:13:34 10yrs ago if someone predicted the U.S would become the largest producer of Oil it would have been considered ludicrous.
7861 2018-11-21 17:13:33 @realDonaldTrump just proved to the world that he is also a politician and not a businessman who is looking for America's interest.  

@JustinTrudeau however i'm waiting for him to stop all the dealings with Saudi Arabia as well. We import lotttttttt of oil from there
7862 2018-11-21 17:13:26 @BillCassidy @SenJohnKennedy @RepGarretGraves @SteveScalise any one of you care to educate him on what low oil prices do to the economy in Louisiana?  Waiting to hear from you but I won’t hold my breath.
7863 2018-11-21 17:13:21 So, basically you said,"Hey Crown Prince--you lower oil prices and I'll brush this whole Khashoggi thing under the rug"....#POSPotus #DirtbagPOStRump #LiarInChief #BiggestLoser #TrickyTrump #DonTheCon

7867 2018-11-21 17:13:13 You get most of your oil from Canada, dude.
7868 2018-11-21 17:13:06 The falling oil price does not anger me. Misses the point. He should ask Saudi Arabia's government to stop the war in Yemen and improve its behaviour. The civil discourse is disconcerting. He called Kim Jong-un 'rocket man', why so much respect for the Saudi Prince?
7869 2018-11-21 17:13:05 Oh eat  on that. You know we need them as much as they need us and we’ve all sold our nation’s soul for oil and arms deals. We’re powerless cause of your Bush. Meaning President Bush nothing further.
7870 2018-11-21 17:13:03 Make oil price dismembering great again !
7871 2018-11-21 17:12:59 Yes because we can rise the oil prices up to $150, so you should be thankful for your president
7872 2018-11-21 17:12:55 Saudi Arabia  is cutting oil production by 50% because of the current oil glut.
They are doing this so the prices can go back up.
7873 2018-11-21 17:12:53 Namaste Tulsi Ji... 

Is it possible for America to be against Saudi/KSA when oil is priced in USD and KSA/Dubai currency being hard pegged to USD? Also considering their investments in US with their reserves? 

If there is a way, please share a way which does not affect US. Thx.
7874 2018-11-21 17:12:48 What is wrong with the Governors of Niger Deltans? They should come together and fight for Akwa Ibom house of assembly. APC led government has no good plan for us but to steal our oil and destroy us. Rise up youths and Militants. Read Reno tweet. stop looking but act fast.

7879 2018-11-21 17:12:34 Yes, Saudi Arabia, thank you for the low oil prices.

- Houston
7880 2018-11-21 17:12:28 The largest sources of U.S. imported oil were: Canada (40%), Saudi Arabia (11%),Venezuela (9%), Mexico (8%), and Colombia (4%).
7881 2018-11-21 17:12:27 Thank you to Donald for sacrificing the life of a United States resident journalist with family and loved ones living in the US to a Saudi butcher, who had him decapitated and dismembered, in exchange for oil. #AmericanValues
7882 2018-11-21 17:12:25 Well, the #PetroDollar is the most dangerous thing to disturb.

If the oil companies stop trading in dollars, our currency will be worthless

7885 2018-11-21 17:12:19 It means we have to buy Saudi oil because fracking jobs in Montana aren't as valuable as Saudis buying Trump condos and staying in Trump hotels.

7888 2018-11-21 17:12:18 You will not be remembered for bringing oil prices down or for that largely non-existent arms deL but you will be remembered for giving a pass on the Saudis killing an American journalist. It will be discussed long after you leave the presidency. #NotInMyName

7890 2018-11-21 17:12:11 Yes, absolutely .... the nominal surplus will definitely see a boost from this, if these prices are sustained. The oil price, though, is a wild card. €60 for 2019 maybe?

7894 2018-11-21 17:12:02 We get 40% of our oil from canada 11% from saudi's trump could release some of our strategic reserves to minimize any increase. Bottom line is our national integrity is not for sale. Not now not ever.
7895 2018-11-21 17:12:01 @realDonaldTrump   We should be working to end our addiction to oil and move toward renewable resources like alternative energy, solar, wind power, etc.

7899 2018-11-21 17:11:47 I cannot say how disgusting our Pigedent is with this declaration. One dismemberment, and oil prices are down. He sees this as a gloating point. As something he's done right. But, the question for we Americans is: do we want to pay this price?
7900 2018-11-21 17:11:43 Alchemy is back. Trump can change blood to oil.
7901 2018-11-21 17:11:43 We don't need their oil.
7902 2018-11-21 17:11:42 Not to sound like a sad adult but my grandparents just paid for my oil change and my gas to drive to Houston tomorrow and my broke college self is gonna cry 
7903 2018-11-21 17:11:41 Blood and Oil, a nasty combination
7904 2018-11-21 17:11:37 NewsFlash: The USA exports oil as well, have a grown up explain this to you.
7905 2018-11-21 17:11:36 Last I heard, Canada was getting $16 a barrel for it's crude oil sold into the U.S.

7910 2018-11-21 17:11:18 Facts facts, I’ve been trying to avoid popping em but I dont think its an ingrown hair issue but more or so an oil buildup issue. Where do you usually get your shit from?
7911 2018-11-21 17:11:16 ... who have other training.  We had situations across the province where getting skilled (as in trained) workers in a variety of roles was almost impossible because they would get an offer from somewhere up at the oil sands and disappear. /2

7913 2018-11-21 17:11:12 Nak beli scrub & cleansing oil Simple tapi harga ngan quantity mcm tak berbaloi pulak 
7914 2018-11-21 17:11:12 The US gets most of their oil from Canada.  Coming in at 2nd, they get it from SA.  The $2.5 billion trade deficit is not that much considering how much oil we buy from them...  so yes, it’s worth the business even at the expense of Khashoggi terrible death.
7915 2018-11-21 17:11:10 Don't forget to thank and then hug an oil dictator. Remember making friends w/ one will ensure when ur current job is up the money keeps flowing to u. If worried abt ur ethics, don't be. Money makes the world go round. Plus u can assuage ur guilt by tithing.
7916 2018-11-21 17:11:07 Unfortunately, oil prices have little to do with it.  This is driven by the desire to create a countervailing presence to Iran in the region.  The issue is whether we ought to invest in Saudi Arabia as that counterbalance. Fair question indeed. However, if not Saudi Arabia, who?
7917 2018-11-21 17:11:07 BLOOD for OIL. That’s Trump new mantra.
7918 2018-11-21 17:11:05 "Trump thanks Saudis for lower oil price"  
Yep, taking advantage of the "We-kill-your-journalist : you-get-a-rebate-on-your-next-oil-purchase" coupon was a great idea @realDonaldTrump .   #Trump #JamalKhashoggi
7919 2018-11-21 17:11:04 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
7920 2018-11-21 17:11:01 Idk who’s daughter needs to hear this but.... get a oil change
7921 2018-11-21 17:10:51 Gasoline prices don’t hit just drivers it drives the price of EVERY good or service that is transported, gas prices need to be tied to a percentage of oil price.
7922 2018-11-21 17:10:50 Doesn't he know that it's bcoz of USA's waiver to several countries like India and EU regarding to Iran oils ,the oil prices r coming down.
7923 2018-11-21 17:10:50 Fun fact:  if you put a drop or two of peppermint oil in your cpap machine,  it will feel less like a Christmastime spa treatment and way more like you maced yourself.  Happy holidays.
7924 2018-11-21 17:10:49 Of course, but what do you suggest? The US has never held the Saudis accountable for any of the atrocities they commit. And meanwhile we sell them arms, buy their oil and even allow military suppliers like Boeing to have plants inside their borders.
7925 2018-11-21 17:10:47 Oh and kiss up to SA so much that domestic oil production is hurt....oh and thousands of Americans unemployed! So you're calling for putting Americans out of work? In sum, you don't mind SA killing permanent residents AND you want Americans out of work.
7926 2018-11-21 17:10:38 It will take multiple decades to eliminate oil and major changes in our lifestyles to use solar or wind. You are nuts if you think we can eliminate it in the short run.m
7927 2018-11-21 17:10:38 As soon as we get the $54 oil tweet the shit is up $2.  Can’t make this stuff up.
7928 2018-11-21 17:10:35 I think ur missing the point guys. Canada oil supply is a fly on an elephants ass
7929 2018-11-21 17:10:33 Every time Americans fill their tanks with this “cheap oil” gasoline a few drops of Jamal Khashoggi’s blood is mixed in.  America has surrendered it’s soul to this greedy devil.
7930 2018-11-21 17:10:30 Over do it. Gotta have that oil dripping down yo face an neck like Pinkie 
7931 2018-11-21 17:10:27 Yup, Washington to Ottawa is a 90 min flight.
Despite our long history of friendship & mutual cooperation on the vast majority of important items, Trump has been too busy to visit Canada. 40% of US oil comes from Canada, but we're not willing to line Trump's pockets w/ kickback $
7932 2018-11-21 17:10:24 We don't buy oil from Saudi Arabia....
7933 2018-11-21 17:10:22 It is because they vegans made them stop using beef fat in the frier oil.

7939 2018-11-21 17:10:02 Exactly! @realDonaldTrump is so last century. America controls the marginal price of oil, not #SaudiArabia
7940 2018-11-21 17:10:02 Even though we get the  vast majority of oil from Canada! What a fucking knob
7941 2018-11-21 17:09:58 Trolling the death of an American resident. Really every time I think you can't get any lower. Saudi's can kill whoever they want as long as oil prices go lower? Blood for oil???  Your a disgrace.
7942 2018-11-21 17:09:53 Also, the barrel price of oil just means his buddies that own refineries make a higher profit.
7943 2018-11-21 17:09:52 That's great we need to take care of the United States, when we give to other countries we have no appreciation for what we do for them i think they should all be cut off.We help with Structure first Aid Food Billions of Dollars & they have all the Oil & Wealth .
7944 2018-11-21 17:09:48 $CL_F bounced strongly after making new lows yesterday. 56.07 - 57.38 should end 3 waves from the low #Elliottwave #Oil

7946 2018-11-21 17:09:39 lower oil is going to have an impact imo -- changes the 19 outlook
7947 2018-11-21 17:09:36 Do them beard oil shit really work asking for a friend
7948 2018-11-21 17:09:36 If you were looking to bottom-fish Crude oil, you now have a bullish momentum divergence and failed breakdown to work with if we close above last week's lows.

If you were trying to get long for anything other than a day trade before today, you were gambling, not trading.
7949 2018-11-21 17:09:34 if people would wake up, the government would have to follow suit.... we need to force politicians to give up oil and gas lobby money or they won’t get any votes, but what are the chances that will ever happen.
7950 2018-11-21 17:09:33 Man would I would love to see a meme with the 2 paid trolls oiling Dean down in Greece. ROTFLMAO!!!
Fabs/Pollack can provide all the oil/amenities lmao.
7951 2018-11-21 17:09:29 Hey, Idiot, supply and demand.  Most countries don't need oil anymore with renewables coming online.  You told us US was independent so what do we care about them?  Price of Solar far install less than maintaining coal mine now.
7952 2018-11-21 17:09:28 Good morning everyone! Just a reminder that the President of our country is ~openly~ siding with a murderous regime bc of money and oil!!! Haha also tomorrow is Thanksgiving so gobble-gobble I guess !!
7953 2018-11-21 17:09:26 Vaping CBD oil and thinking abt which speech to write first.
7954 2018-11-21 17:09:16 @realDonaldTrump DonaldTrump Dosent now how oil mkts work. Saudi only 11%, largest supplier Canada. Thinking you didn't attend classes at Wharton bet they are embarrassed.
7955 2018-11-21 17:09:14 @ThomasPaine5 It's kind of wierd isn't it that this perception of Saudi Arabia being the top US provider imported oil when it's really Canada by a huge margin? Just shows how convincing Operation Perception Deception can be at times..
7956 2018-11-21 17:09:11 I’m here where my palm oil just finished & no hope of getting any sooner than a week. Nothing like ponmo here, no shaki, roundabout etc but she’ll be posting them everyday- tell me what’s the way of not blocking. 
7957 2018-11-21 17:09:11 Lots of Americans made windfall gains that turned them into oil magnates like Rockefeller and Getty.
7958 2018-11-21 17:09:09 Kalau x pakai ipone,aku pakai rock oil guardian 10/40
7959 2018-11-21 17:09:09 I hope you have some left over squirrel oil, it has brought you much luck the last few weeks.
7960 2018-11-21 17:09:07 This has nothing to do with lower oil prices or lower gas prices. That's just a screen for tRUMP protecting his self-interests as usual. Saudis spend on @realDonaldTrump properties. It's that simple.

7965 2018-11-21 17:08:57 US has more oil than both the others...Liberals will not allow processing.
7966 2018-11-21 17:08:54 Hi Giancarlo, is an oil change the only service you received yesterday? If so, please DM us with the address of the service center visited, your full name, email and phone number and we will look into this for you. That shouldn't be the cost of just an oil change. Thank you.
7967 2018-11-21 17:08:53 u mother fukker the world is asking for the remains of #JamalKhashoggi you can't stop bragging about the arab oil ??????? f ....u ......
7968 2018-11-21 17:08:49 Be sure to thank Khashoggi for being brutally murdered for your lowered oil prices.  Who will be sacrificed next when the prices go back up?
7969 2018-11-21 17:08:48 The amount of negativity people are quick to respond.. Its sad, Oil price raises they blame the Potus.. Oil Price drops they still hate the Potus.. Maybe it's not the Potus that needs to change.. But the person you see in the mirror.. #MAGA
7970 2018-11-21 17:08:47 Keep in mind. Canada is the largest supplier of oil to the US. Accounts for 40% compared to Saudi Arabia's 11%.
7971 2018-11-21 17:08:46 Oil prices always tend to go down when the market is sinking. Volatility in the tech space and the failure of the tax breaks is causing the markets to fall. Hence lower oil prices.
7972 2018-11-21 17:08:45 Too bad my potential  fuel savings are eclipsed by the losses in my retirement accounts.  Low oil prices are bad for Oklahoma and Texas.  Presidentin' sure is hard.
7973 2018-11-21 17:08:43 Does anyone use CBD oil for joint pain? Totally clueless about it but would love some recommendations.
7974 2018-11-21 17:08:40 Especially when we only get 9% of our oil from them. We produce more in country.
7975 2018-11-21 17:08:39 We care about your state sanctioned approval of the murder of an American journalist.  Not oil, you monster
7976 2018-11-21 17:08:30 Trump & Saudis run things the same way. Murder, who cares! We’ll trade oil for lives & lower price to boot! Just look the other way!
7977 2018-11-21 17:08:25 Imagine people thinking Oil is going to zero or "dead" after a double-digit sell-off.
7978 2018-11-21 17:08:25 4. Through  love and passio com n 1John 4:8 Mtt 14:14

7979 2018-11-21 17:08:21 why would you thank a country that only supplies 11% of our oil when you should be thank CANADA who provides us with the majority of our supply??? oh thats right because YOU OWE SAUDI MONEY!
7980 2018-11-21 17:08:18 I know facts aren't your thing, but consider this: Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia. And Canadians don't murder journalists. #GOPcomplicit
7981 2018-11-21 17:08:16 Moi je melange 
Je mets le argan oil sleek + la mousse apres je mets un bandeau 
Btw le ecostyle la le nouveau fait pousser les baby hair dee oouuf
7982 2018-11-21 17:08:16 LOL!!!

Canada provides 40% of our oil.

Saudi Arabia provides 11%.

Thank you, Canada!
7983 2018-11-21 17:08:10 time to make my yearly promise to everyone that I will not use gasoline instead of peanut oil to fry my turkey.
7984 2018-11-21 17:07:56 Oh, yeah? I would be willing to pay into someone's election campaign if they supported the #GreenNewDeal to help us get away from these #FossilFools and the dependence on oil.
7985 2018-11-21 17:07:54 Bless your heart. You just traded the life of a resident of America for cheap oil.
7986 2018-11-21 17:07:51 Be factual, don’t be a liar!  Reserve was $29bill. It wasn’t the oil that crashed the economy.
7987 2018-11-21 17:07:48 First the whole comparison is bad because you didn't have Yemen and Kashoggi. More importantly, it's terribly wrong for Prez to explicitly say, in 3rd-grader language, that he won't oppose Saudi Arabia because they give us money and oil.
7988 2018-11-21 17:07:45 ONLY thing I like about the winter is putting oil on my skin 
7989 2018-11-21 17:07:45 #Saudis will be more affiliated, with us, we now have the oil!!!
7990 2018-11-21 17:07:45 You know how hard it’s going to be for trump to get that crude oil off of him.
7991 2018-11-21 17:07:43 Oil prices are a two-edged sword. Too low destroys a true wealth and job creating sector and gives $$$ to OPEC; too high puts the brakes on the whole economy and hurts jobs and families. Our present path strikes a good balance. I love this planet and believe...
7992 2018-11-21 17:07:38 Coming home and getting premium high grade CBD instead of my cheap hemp oil. Life=made
7993 2018-11-21 17:07:38 So, what is the realpolitik argument? That we need their oil? We don't. That sanctioning them would hurt oil prices? It would have no impact. That we'd lose many jobs if we didn't sell them weapons? We wouldn't. That they'd turn to RU/ PRC if we got tough? No more than they have.
7994 2018-11-21 17:07:33 Withy tips: If you can’t burn sage or incense, use peppermint or spearmint essential oil mixed with some water in a spritz bottle and spray to cleanse your room or scared place 
7995 2018-11-21 17:07:27 How low can you go? Blood for oil.
7996 2018-11-21 17:07:26 It seems the class of bad guys who act like this already know that if they have something you really want/need (oil, regional influence, bases, geopolitical balance, intel) that they can stretch the rules a long long way depending on what it is...
7997 2018-11-21 17:07:25 It is all about Israel really. They are trying to help bring peace and boy that was a mistake. But Iran has plenty of oil and those European deals are waiting in the background. I knew something was up after Canada and MSM/Dems all blowing the trumpets while ignoring Iran-Yemen
7998 2018-11-21 17:07:25 I thought we got most of our oil from Canada?
7999 2018-11-21 17:07:09 The difference between Trump bending the knee to the Saudis vis-a-vis other presidents is until Trump really loosened the restraints on domestic oil, we really needed them
8000 2018-11-21 17:07:06 YOU'RE A LIAR!!! SO SAUDI ARABIA LOWERED THE OIL PRICES SO THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH MURDER. FUNNY HOW SAUDI ARABIA ONLY PROVIDES 9% OF THE US OIL & CANADA PROVIDES 40% OF US OIL & TRUMP IS SO NASTY TO CANADA?!?!? HE ALWAYS LOVES THE SWAMP MORE!!!
8001 2018-11-21 17:07:03 Well, we know your price; you'd sell a man's life for half-priced oil. 
Or is that because he was 'just' a brown man? 
Or is that because he was a journalist?
8002 2018-11-21 17:06:59 Gotta love some click bait. "Guy from uae finds a secret to financial success." Yh pretty sure its called oil pal. Haha
8003 2018-11-21 17:06:58 And owe million's in back taxes, from his, scam Gov. Org. programs. He's a snake oil salesman, not a preacher.
8004 2018-11-21 17:06:54 You’d be pretty stupid if you think the tax cut had any effect on oil prices.
8005 2018-11-21 17:06:51 Hahaha bro he quotes Brent oil peak and WTI oil low hahaha wtf this guy fried
8006 2018-11-21 17:06:48 Your an educated man, what the hell are you talking this bullshite there IS no more negotiations, stop with the snake oil the way out is the people's vote
8007 2018-11-21 17:06:48 You see, it is sooooo easy: You tariff wars killed the economic outlook and oil is getting cheaper.
Congrats.
8008 2018-11-21 17:06:47 And destroying the US domestic oil business by making US oil too expensive to drill for, this undermining energy independence!
8009 2018-11-21 17:06:42 Blood for oil has never been more apparent.
8010 2018-11-21 17:06:41 Oil prices have been low for awhile and are subject to free markets not your Twitter.
8011 2018-11-21 17:06:32 Tee tree oil and  lavender  Worked for me
8012 2018-11-21 17:06:28 Did you guys see the oil prices tho
8013 2018-11-21 17:06:22 Heheheheheheehhe kubadilisha oil kwa another garage it's more healthy ama namna gani
8014 2018-11-21 17:06:22 カレーおいしいから大丈夫。
8015 2018-11-21 17:06:18 You’re not getting it... it’s about oil market share traded in Federal Reserve notes...
8016 2018-11-21 17:06:15 Trump's message over the last 24 hours to foreign countries: it doesn't matter what human rights atrocities you commit, as long as they're not against Christians and you buy our weapons and give us a good deal on oil.
8017 2018-11-21 17:06:13 Lower oil prices affect almost all business around the globe. From large operators, to small service providers. Companies reduce staff before improving processes to attend to lower revenues & profits, if any. Small companies shut down, employees retrenched. We all suffer! Fuck u
8018 2018-11-21 17:06:11 Wait, oil prices are lower? Lower than what?
8019 2018-11-21 17:06:05 @TylerTrades @stocktechnician sinking oil prices, profit slow down, higher interest rates, trade war, all signs point to recession
8020 2018-11-21 17:06:01 It's the trump affect.State wide narrative is easy to follow as opposed to cold hard facts & digging which becomes known as trouble making.
8021 2018-11-21 17:05:59 Setup, with trumps knowledge. Oil for a life.
#RemoveTrumpNow
8022 2018-11-21 17:05:54 At what expense? A human life. That's the story of America; always willing to sacrifice human lives for oil.
8023 2018-11-21 17:05:50 @POTUS is thanking a murderous regime who killed and dismembered a US resident reporter because oil prices are lower. How many people can they murder if oil drops to $30 a barrel? Do they get to come to the US and kill for sport? Sick.
8024 2018-11-21 17:05:49 Long story short I stored my fresh oil painting in the same closet with my hamster for two days to dry and now my hamster is mad high and has the munchies? Idek how drugs work ok hamsters but my boy is hungry asf
8025 2018-11-21 17:05:48 Tech is already there. Just the corruption in this country from oil companies that keep this change from coming. Would def bring a new industry to the US and damn do we need such a thing
8026 2018-11-21 17:05:47 Wow precious, Barabia Downs shrinks fish oil pricies! Shrivels! Barabia Downs so nice to us! We loveses Barabia Downs! Almost doesn’t matters they makes news scrollist vanish! Almost! If they gives us cheaper fish oils maybe we forgets! Forgets what precious?
8027 2018-11-21 17:05:42 Just for his personal enrichment. He doesn’t give a shit about American arms or oil sales.
8028 2018-11-21 17:05:39 Hey Numbnuts, lower oil prices means fewer jobs in the American oil industry.  Stop sucking up to the Saudis. Our country was founded to Defy Kings and End Monarchy. You do know Saudi Arabia is ruled as a repressive absolute monarchy right?
8029 2018-11-21 17:05:39 @BNNBloomberg asks 1. Is Canada on a sustainable fiscal track? 2. Will the government answer Corporate Canada’s calls to bolster competitiveness? 3. What can the government do to deliver relief to Alberta’s oil sector? Will @Bill_Morneau have answers?
8030 2018-11-21 17:05:35 The US is the largest exporter of oil in the world, about 14%.
8031 2018-11-21 17:05:34 A barrel of oil is at 54$ and gas is still over two dollars a gal 
8032 2018-11-21 17:05:33 I guess Don hasn’t been doing his homework. The U.S. only gets 11% of its oil from RSA so the price isn’t that big a deal for us. I believe our largest supplier is Canada 
8033 2018-11-21 17:05:31 Lower oil prices, thanks to Canada....hopefully he will just shut up for Thanksgiving...sick of hearing about him
8034 2018-11-21 17:05:30 CIA conclude MBS ordered killing of Khashoggi but Trump effectively lets him off for oil. Turkey seeing leverage slipping after openly acknowledging they bugged Saudi embassy. Any takers on Turkey openly releasing video of killing just as US sitting down to Thanksgiving turkey?
8035 2018-11-21 17:05:27 Every drop of that oil is blood on your hands! And you have drawn my beautiful country down that skunk hole and tarred us all with the same bloody brush. Shame on you Trump, and shame on you for dragging us all with you. Your now as culpable as Saudi Arabia.
8036 2018-11-21 17:05:22 If we became energy independent we wouldn't care what KSA gets for their oil cuz it won't be any US$.
8037 2018-11-21 17:05:13 He should be thanking the oil workers in Permian basin and Gulf of Mexico
8038 2018-11-21 17:05:12 OVX falling just as $OIL moving up!
8039 2018-11-21 17:05:12 The author who is short Tesla also fails to mention that people buy Tesla want to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy.  So in other words get off of oil! $tm $tsla

Oil prices getting lower, Daddy. Great, Daddy! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World Daddy. Enjoy, Daddy! $54 was just $82, Daddy. Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let's go Lower, Daddy!
8041 2018-11-21 17:05:11 with tomorrow fast approaching. I'm curious as to people's dinner choices. We're doing Julia Child's butterflied and sage rubbed turkey roasted over root veggies, a rustic bread stuffing on the side, tangzhong style dinner rolls, squash, and a lemon cranberry olive oil cake.
8042 2018-11-21 17:05:10 I'd rather pay more for oil than to have you condone the killing of our citizens by the Saudi's. It's blood money. Ashamed of our President and his lack of moral values.
8043 2018-11-21 17:05:09 You know Saudi Arabia is only responsible for 11% of American oil imports? Canada is responsible for 40%. So, know that you've been educated, you're welcome 
8044 2018-11-21 17:05:08 Crude oil inventories up 9 straight weeks. During that time, totals went from 31.2 million bbl below 5-year avg. to 12.5 million bbl above 5-year avg. #EIA
8045 2018-11-21 17:05:07 This is terrible! Don’t you realize low oil prices are bad for the oil industry?
8046 2018-11-21 17:05:01 How's our oil and gas sector doing? Any associated drop in tax revenues you'd care to comment on? How about steel and aluminum? Got that sorted out yet? Pipeline under construction? Yeah, things are going swimmingly.
8047 2018-11-21 17:05:00 WTI oil at $54.77/barrel, +$1.34.
8048 2018-11-21 17:04:59 Heating oil companies 
The more democrats mouth off
The higher the price 
10 cents just today.
8049 2018-11-21 17:04:56 @atiku Nigerians in Derbyshire is %100 behind you.I have my PVC ready and will be travelling to vote for Atiku/Obi ticket.We are tired of Buhari’s s junkie ways assuming that oil is significant indicator for economic growth. #LetsGetNigeriaWorkingAgain
8050 2018-11-21 17:04:55 11% of imported oil from Saudi Arabia.
8051 2018-11-21 17:04:54 We are all “Saudi Arabia’s bitch” because our currency relies on oil markets mostly controlled by them.
8052 2018-11-21 17:04:53 His grasp of how oil/gas pricing works is non existent.
8053 2018-11-21 17:04:52 He thinks its the 70s....Can someone please tell him who produces the most oil!!!!
8054 2018-11-21 17:04:49 We get around 9% of our oil from them.
8055 2018-11-21 17:04:48 Blood for oil. 
Brilliant sir! Only you could have done it sir! Your pledge fealty to MbS makes all patriotic Americans so proud.
Sir, you're our big brother.
8056 2018-11-21 17:04:46 Today on I'm trans and hate my stubble:
Can't afford any kind of electrolysis or laser atm so I've been looking for alternatives.
Anyone have experience with Thanaka and safflower oil? Thinking about giving it a try
8057 2018-11-21 17:04:38 Not have oil
8058 2018-11-21 17:04:36 My first car
8059 2018-11-21 17:04:36 I think I have said it before: I can't for the death of me understand why a person from the civilized world would as much as think of going to any of these murder states. If they didn't have their damned oil, no one would waste a minute on them.
8060 2018-11-21 17:04:33 uh oil
8061 2018-11-21 17:04:30 Saudi Arabia.  The country that assassinated a journalist.  So you are on team oil and against the first amendment and the constitution?? You are embarrassing.
8062 2018-11-21 17:04:30 Yeah, thanks for the cheap oil, who cares about murdered journalists anyway...
8063 2018-11-21 17:04:29 Le ton monte envers Trump dans les milieux du pétrole de schiste qui lui reprochent de favoriser les prix bas du pétrole conventionnel au détriment de leur filière Trump n'est pas Shale Oil First mais plutôt Saudi Money First
8064 2018-11-21 17:04:28 I never believed that life in Africa is so spiritual until i saw a man eating bread with anointing oil.
8065 2018-11-21 17:04:27 They pump out a lot of oil. Mbs is sure keeping those gas prices low.  My problem with the anti trump people is how they are acting like this is new. Been like this since 73.
8066 2018-11-21 17:04:21 And the US produces more barrels of oil per day than Saudi.
8067 2018-11-21 17:04:19 Doesn’t this fool know that the prices of oil is really set by the demand if Saudi Arabia new that they could get more money because the demand was very high right now you can bet your ass it would be
8068 2018-11-21 17:04:18 Facts he didn’t even use the correct oil price
8069 2018-11-21 17:04:16 You made a deal with Saudis. Blood for oil. You’re an immoral person. Disgusting. You have to go. Where are the Rs?
8070 2018-11-21 17:04:15 Why don’t you come out and say that every other person in the president’s place would respond the same way. As important as they are, no president is going to let the death of one person come between our relationship with them. Be real! Too much oil at stake
8071 2018-11-21 17:04:15 Brick that turkey. Butterfly your turkey. Quarter it. Season turkey. Wrap two bricks up in aluminum foil. Heat those in the toaster oven. Heat up a skillet w oil. Add turkey to fit skillet. Squash with heated bricks and put bricks, turkey, and skillet into toaster oven till done.
8072 2018-11-21 17:04:13 Hey, @realDonaldTrump, I heard from a real smart guy that immigrants are sneaking in through oil pipelines. We need to protect our borders! #plugemup
8073 2018-11-21 17:04:12 Did you see Homer THANKING Saudi Arabia for lower oil prices? Did you know Homer NEVER even called the poor guys family to give them his condolences? Complete moron and sociopath
8074 2018-11-21 17:04:09 USA #1 oil producers
8075 2018-11-21 17:04:08 To those in charge, oil is more valuable than human blood
8076 2018-11-21 17:04:04 add oil! haha
8077 2018-11-21 17:04:04 Every time Americans fill their tanks with this “cheap oil” gasoline a few drops of Jamal Khashoggi’s blood is mixed in.  America has surrendered it’s soul to this greedy devil.
8078 2018-11-21 17:03:59 Maybe if you and your liberal environmental policies on oil didn't make us 100% dependent on Saudi Arabia we could actually do something. Keep reading other people's words and leave world politics to those who know how things work.
8079 2018-11-21 17:03:57 As for Nigeria, NBS data is there to show that we only went into recession after Buhari's incompetence impacted the private sector.

Even when oil hit the lowest point, our economy did not stop growing.

What caused it to contract was Buhari's lack of policies and incompetence.
8080 2018-11-21 17:03:57 So my life is worth lower oil prices. Duly noted.
8081 2018-11-21 17:03:52 SO WHAT!!!!!

CHEAP OIL PRICES ARE NOT GOING TO BRIBE AMERICANS INTO BEING OKAY WITH THE COVER-UP OF AN AMERICAN RESIDENT @realDpaldTrump!!!!

@GOP AMERICAN VALUES ARE NOT UP FOR SALE!!!
@LindseyGrahamSC @MittRomney @senatemajldr @bensasse @ChuckGrassley
8082 2018-11-21 17:03:51 Would *love* to see the 100s of millions of 2-stroke (gas/oil mix) scooters in places like SE Asia go to clean electric!  The amount this would cut down on urban noise and air pollution would be *huge*.
8083 2018-11-21 17:03:46 You heard it first here. The NDP and oil glut is @Dfildebrandt’s fault. #ableg
8084 2018-11-21 17:03:45 What about all the oil exceptions given to our Allies to buy Iranian oil? Not really an economic  sanction is it?
8085 2018-11-21 17:03:40 Duuuuuude this a bit on the nose isn't it? A reporter was butchered with bone saws and this tweet appears like a, "I'm going to lower oil prices since you covered for my murdering someone... THANKS BRO!" tweet
8086 2018-11-21 17:03:36 2017, US produced avg of about 9.35M barrels/day (b/d) of crude oil, 3.78M b/d of natural gas liquids, and 1.20M b/d of biofuels and oxygenates, for a petroleum production total of 14.33M b/d.
Total US petroleum consumption averaged 19.96M b/d (Canada exported about 4M b/d to US)
8087 2018-11-21 17:03:36 The oil barons are now referring to him as a "defective product".
8088 2018-11-21 17:03:33 He is praising Saudi Arabia for undercutting the price of US, Canadian and Mexican oil... seems on brand for Trump. America First (under the bus)
8089 2018-11-21 17:03:32 Oil prices are declining  because of supply.  U think Saudi Arabia lowered out of thr goodness of their hearts???? What a fool.. ...
8090 2018-11-21 17:03:31 Girl you got some treatments from couponing ! Anything that is sulfate free and has coconut oil helps , we will get together I’ll show you what I use
8091 2018-11-21 17:03:29 It's called "blood oil" for a reason you cold, heartless, SOB!
8092 2018-11-21 17:03:27 I really wonder why they had to ban oil companies, banks, and telecoms from taking corp members. There would have obviously been more jobs for corp members honestly 
8093 2018-11-21 17:03:25 @drericbergdc Dr. Berg I don’t like coconut oil, what other good fat can I use.
8094 2018-11-21 17:03:21 It would be a few cents at most. 40% of our oil imports are from Canada (who Trump hates.) 11% from Saudi. And... Saudi committed to OPEC they'd cut 1MM barrels a day in December, and is now lobbying other members to match them. Basically a "F-YOU TRUMP" move.
8095 2018-11-21 17:03:17 What do you suggest we do? Should we bomb the Saudi palace and start a war? Seems like a bad idea. Should we stop buying Saudi oil? I'd be ok with it, but how about the family living paycheck to paycheck? Are you ok with $4 or $5 per gallon gas?
8096 2018-11-21 17:03:15 21 dollars for some oil but it has my hair looking so good
8097 2018-11-21 17:03:11 Who are the 3 Oil barrons in the World?  
The U.S., Russia, and Saudi Arabia.
8098 2018-11-21 17:03:07 We get 11% of our oil from Saudi Arabia so once again trump has lied to US
8099 2018-11-21 17:03:06 Btwn Jamal Khashoggi’s death and Saudi’s lower price of oil that is putting money in my pocket and food on the table then I support @realDonaldTrump on saudi’s..Jamal Khashoggi’s death is irrelevant to me & to America #$54
8100 2018-11-21 17:03:01 Maybe Justin Trudeau will order someone gruesomely murdered too. Then you can thank Canada for all the oil we get from them! MAGA!
8101 2018-11-21 17:03:01 It’s ok to murder people as long as you can get a good price on oil from them
8102 2018-11-21 17:02:57 An inspiring metaphor heard in the #Med2018 debates: there is a triple hostage crisis in the MENA region. Countries and societies are taken hostage by (1) austerity/IMF-oriented reforms; (2) oil and rentier economies & (3) conflicts and violence.
8103 2018-11-21 17:02:52 Nicola Sturgeons SNP’s policy’s just like her oil revenues forecast are unattainable , she asked and will be judged on education , never mind healthcare, like Alex Salmond, she might just be shown the door after decade of unfitness to govern!
8104 2018-11-21 17:02:50 Had an amazing day of no plastic bags, bought groceries with minimal packaging, and then went to buy a facial oil and the fucking thing came in a plastic bottle cause I was too lazy to check the box. 

I am returning it tomorrow, such is my level of annoyance
8105 2018-11-21 17:02:49 i love palm oil
8106 2018-11-21 17:02:48 #Me me me me me. Did u just thank Saudi Arabia for murdering an American resident.....because.....oil? #WeakPatheticLeader #FuckingTraitor
8107 2018-11-21 17:02:45 Ready oil pump hnd blade..
8108 2018-11-21 17:02:45 I wish Trump would have went against Saudi Arabia so I could watch the Economy Collapse by extreme Oil shortages, what happens when Saudi Arabia stops taking the US Petrol Dollar? Did Iraq get out of the USD back then, was that the reason for 43?
8109 2018-11-21 17:02:43 I got a really funny joke for you guys.
“ This woman thought she was the bomb with her man. But, when he smiled everybody was like BP OIL SPILL because, his Gums are so Black.” Hilarious.
8110 2018-11-21 17:02:40 You got be naive not to know part of their punishment are lower oil prices. Don't expect them to rise for sometime.
8111 2018-11-21 17:02:39 Did you change your oil?
8112 2018-11-21 17:02:39 The gold standard. US currency is backed by Saudi oil.
8113 2018-11-21 17:02:36 coconut oil
8114 2018-11-21 17:02:35 Look at the low oil prices for what they are. A bribe to ignore Khashoggi and Yemen. Looks like Donny took the bribe in our name and then bragged about it.
8115 2018-11-21 17:02:30 No, it is a, and very tough decision, when it comes to world economics. He didn't put himself first, because those pass politicians created this mess with oil and Saudi. Intel say 1 thing, but the politicians are telling him another. He was put between the knife and loaded gun
8116 2018-11-21 17:02:30 It’s not the Premier’s Opposition to a pipeline what you should be concerned about Is American money being used to keep Alberta oil in the ground
8117 2018-11-21 17:02:25 I was watching an oil change tutorial on YouTube and halfway through the video the dude that’s filming pans to his feet and there’s a little chipmunk eating seeds next to him and then he pans back and never mentions it. lmao wtf kinda Disney princess ass car mechanic
8118 2018-11-21 17:02:22 Khashoggi’s family is so very thankful that the price of oil has been lowered. The world now knows that the value you place on human life is $28 #howtogetawaywithmurder
8119 2018-11-21 17:02:20 Trump we get 11% of our oil from your buddy the #KillerKingToBe and 40% from Canada. But you cover up for Saudi Arabia while insulting and bullying Canada. But then Canada didn’t buy $40-$50 million worth of condos from you. Trump is a raving moron. #ItIsWhatItIs & u r a #Loser
8120 2018-11-21 17:02:14 Blood Oil from Saudi Arabia.
8121 2018-11-21 17:02:13 My fellow Americans when putting oil in your own car please strain it with a Gold fish net to keep the body parts it may contain.  Then mail them to the White House.  Thank you.
8122 2018-11-21 17:02:11 It’s not for the sake of oil and arms—experts have debunked these as reasons. The real reason is the amount of cash the Saudis pour into DT’s pocket. Follow the money going into DT’s org and you’ll always find the motivation behind actions by these grifters.
8123 2018-11-21 17:02:04 I agree #rainwaterharvesting, should be a standard fit as part of every new home, along with solar PV, or PVT or solar thermal. BUT, the reason its not, is the power of the building industry that only seeks to complete the basics and employ those who have the common build skills
8124 2018-11-21 17:01:59 Oil prices dropping is the sign of an impending recession. Not enough demand. Econ 101.
8125 2018-11-21 17:01:57 We sold our soul for low oil prices.. disgusting
8126 2018-11-21 17:01:53 So @realDonaldTrump is thanking Saudi Arabia for lower oil prices which isn't factual and giving them a pass for the murder of a member of the media. Is this what putting America first means to him? Really seems like he's putting dictators first as he hopes to become one. #NEVER
8127 2018-11-21 17:01:53 Did the price of oil drop along with the rest of market? All 2018 market gains have been wiped out.  Because of tariffs Ford is laying people off & soy exports are down 94%. Last time this happened was before the 2008 Great Recession.  PS we only get 11% of our oil from Saudi.
8128 2018-11-21 17:01:53 Off to the mechanic. Need inspection oil change and likely 4 new tires. 

They're gonna jam it in dry and spit on e while they take turns this is gonna be rough.
8129 2018-11-21 17:01:52 Try rubbing baby oil on it.
8130 2018-11-21 17:01:49 Saudi Arabia brutally murders renowned journalist.  Increases oil production in attempt to ease International outrage.  US President congratulates them.  A new low for Failing @realDonaldTrump.  What a disgrace you are!
8131 2018-11-21 17:01:44 Mixed feelings here. Lower oil prices do help every day Americans, but as I work in the offshore oil industry, lower prices hurt the oil workers. The last oil crash led to thousands being laid off in the Gulf, of whom I was one of them.
8132 2018-11-21 17:01:40 WH will expect Saudi Arabia to ensure oil prices do not spike again" And if they do, they'll force Saudi Embassy to post a "welcome sign" like:
"Embassy of Saudi Arabia. Come in peace Leave in pieces..."
8133 2018-11-21 17:01:39 Oil prices are lower due to global economic fears of lower future growth. It isn’t being done out of kindness.
8134 2018-11-21 17:01:38 The oil is only mentioned because that is the part that most people will care about.
The "how does it effect me, personally" mentality.
Whatever is beyond that, I don't know. This is basically Trump saying, "I own you" and then he is going to milk it like a businessman.
8135 2018-11-21 17:01:34 Your soul is as black and thick as the oil you're so proud to take from the Saudis
8136 2018-11-21 17:01:34 Don't go for brands bro. Use natural oils like castor oil, hemp seed, or jojoba. I personally wash and use conditioner for my beard too. When those bumps come in try to get someone to pluck them rather than pop them. Use shampoos with natural oils and no sulfate
8137 2018-11-21 17:01:33 @waitrose own brand bread has palm oil in it... that’s a shame and very disappointing, won’t be buying that again. #PalmOilAlarmCall
8138 2018-11-21 17:01:32 Which one contains more blood, oil from Saudi, Iran or Iraq?
8139 2018-11-21 17:01:27 Really? They ordered the murder of a man and you are thanking them for low oil prices. This sounds like an episode of Criminal Minds.
8140 2018-11-21 17:01:22 Las Las we will drink this oil by ourselves.
8141 2018-11-21 17:01:21 Bullshit.  This is all about money and oil.  It would not surprise me if a healthy little kick back wasn't in the cards somewhere.
8142 2018-11-21 17:01:19 Cheap oil prices is not worthy producing they will wait until it's get higher
8143 2018-11-21 17:01:18 I pick LIFE over oil prices trump
8144 2018-11-21 17:01:15 At least we have eliminated one out of the three. Bicycle works good too. Or in your case you may prefer a tricycle. Either way world oil consumption is still increasing so go pound sand.
8145 2018-11-21 17:01:14 I agree the Saudis don't do enough. But it's above my pay grade. There a good reason we have been there strongest ally for 50 years. It all about the oil. They keep prices down. Russia goes broke
8146 2018-11-21 17:01:08 There were plenty of checks. The checks from the NRA, the Saudis, the Koch bros, Sheldon Adelson, Big: Oil, Coal, Pharma...
8147 2018-11-21 17:01:07 my fuckin car would need an oil change durning the holidays ... lmao guess it’ll be a christmas gift 
8148 2018-11-21 17:01:02 You have GOT to be kidding! Was this a quidproque? Did you tell YOUR PRINCE you would back him, no sanctions, and turn a blind eye if they drop the price of oil? I wouldn’t put it past you.
8149 2018-11-21 17:01:00 Truth indeed rather alleviates than hurts, and will always bear up against falsehood, as oil does above water.

8150 2018-11-21 17:00:58 #Oil futures claw back some momentum in US trading: #WTI at $55.39/bbl (+3.67%), #Brent at $64.03/bbl (+2.40%) following overnight hammering #OOTT #energy
8151 2018-11-21 17:00:58 It is the fault of you and your environmentalist buddies that have made it impossible to drill our own oil and have made us dependent on theirs. You would of had to make the same choice if you were in that position. You know it and your followers are completely gaslighted by you.
8152 2018-11-21 17:00:56 Depends on whether you are planning to do your own engine services??

Engine oil service is every 100 hours on our engines.


8153 2018-11-21 17:00:54 Are you even aware that lower oil prices also affect oil companies in America? You’re celebrating a price that results in American oil companies losing lots of money. Congrats dimwit.

8156 2018-11-21 17:00:46 It’s not just that. We do not have the infrastructure or the money to help them. 
I’m worried what will happen in 6 months. Their health? Food, Their children? 
And we still don’t know who is in there.
And one more month for Mexico to start the new government era
8157 2018-11-21 17:00:46 So oil is all that's left. Now OPEC has to keep lowering price of their lone commodity, because of a wildly stupid move by Saudi Arabia...*allegedly*. I don't own a red hat or a gun, but I am fascinated that he's willing to be unliked to accomplish a greater good.
8158 2018-11-21 17:00:45 Hazmat - Newark, NJ: U/D Command reports the substance was identified as waste oil. DEP and Passaic Valley water were notified. Hazmat taking up. #1255685
8159 2018-11-21 17:00:43 If you think the war in Iraq was for anything other than oil, please don’t bother me with your opinions
8160 2018-11-21 17:00:41 Except that the US imports a relatively small amount of oil from SA.
8161 2018-11-21 17:00:36 Russia and the oil cartel are hoping to set prices together but can they ever trust each other?
8162 2018-11-21 17:00:36 I guess you are acknowledging Obama's oil prices in the low $30's. Thank you Obama!
By the way, the oil you are referring to peaked at $77 and change. Also, Saudi Arabia is Not the only oil producer that has attributed to the oil glut. Idiot

8165 2018-11-21 17:00:28 100 dollars for an oil change????!?!?!??? Man hell naw I can get it for half the price.
8166 2018-11-21 17:00:28 Um. Doesn’t much of our foreign oil come from our closest neighbors, Canada and Mexico? (cc @MichaelEWebber)
8167 2018-11-21 17:00:26 Just another example of his incompetence. Crude oil was dropping weeks ago and has nothing to do with Saudi Arabia. It has to do with Iran releasing more crude oil in the market. But Trump isn’t going to praise Iran. His money is on the prince of torture.
8168 2018-11-21 17:00:24 Everyone changing their oil before they drive somewhere for Thanksgiving

8170 2018-11-21 17:00:21 i think we should keep at the oil we send to the US & make it cheaper for us.  #trump has no idea how much oil they get from us. he’ll kiss saudi arabia’s ass and be an POS to canada. but then again we maybe don’t personally help HIM financially. 
8171 2018-11-21 17:00:16 I want to date a man who will oil my scalp for me when he can sense it’s dry
8172 2018-11-21 17:00:14 BS. Trump has nothing to do with oil prices
8173 2018-11-21 17:00:12 And ruin the domestic oil industry.
8174 2018-11-21 17:00:06 4)But,such help comes at a cost to KSA. KSA is only a tiny State,&can only  do so much to alone help.

It needs Humankind's support,not just for oil,but for KSA's own evolution&  progress,at its own pace,not by some with CULTURALLY IGNORANT liberal  views
8175 2018-11-21 17:00:02 Texas, where they drill for oil and store it or ship it out of the country to keep prices high.
8176 2018-11-21 17:00:01 That's your money in peanuts change.They steal $1 million and give you $5 because they think you are stupid and hungry.Every Nigerian should be paid a monthly allowance of nothing less than 300$ a monthly from the blessings of oil sales.Wipe out corruption then this is plausible
8177 2018-11-21 16:59:56 I’m with you! In the Seattle area, we’re paying $3.50+ a gallon. Just like Internet services went up due to the Federal govt (ALL taxes), we’re not seeing that savings on Saudi oil.
8178 2018-11-21 16:59:55 Overall I think you let the data and facts dictate the narrative, and sadly that's not been a positive story.

If he doesn't like what you say, that's what the mute and block buttons are for.

My timeline is much less crazy since I blocked some of the Chia pets.
8179 2018-11-21 16:59:50 Aye - now off you go & do a wee bit of research about Norway. Hint - oil fund. Number of electric cars in us....(just to help it's more than in use in Scotland!)
8180 2018-11-21 16:59:49 Or maybe it's oil revenues, whisky revenues, water and electricity + many more.

#scotref, #Indyref2
8181 2018-11-21 16:59:45 Sham Oil? Not the best name.
8182 2018-11-21 16:59:45 I thought the USA was the Number One oil producer of the world.
8183 2018-11-21 16:59:41 Saudi Arabia my ass. We don't need their fking oil to survive.
8184 2018-11-21 16:59:35 Translation: Get the price of oil to under $50 a barrel and chop up as many journalists as you want.
8185 2018-11-21 16:59:30 None of that changes the fact that the basis of your initial claim (...world AND oil economies tanking) was based on a lie and therefore invalid.

Next time, justify your facts rather than this rigmarole of yours.
8186 2018-11-21 16:59:29 Although the President doesn't play a direct role in oil prices they can decrease them through meetings calls etc. They can use pressure to get a result. Bush actually took actions like those to decrease oil prices. I'm nota Bush fan!
8187 2018-11-21 16:59:27 As at 2015, the agricultural sector was battling the oil sector for the number 1 spot in our economy.

Today, the agricultural sector is battling relegation.

Oil remains unchallenged!
8188 2018-11-21 16:59:26 JUSTICE FOR JAMAL NOW.
Donald J. Trump, oil prices are not more important than humanity. YOU ARE NOT OK. Article 25.
8189 2018-11-21 16:59:24 A glass of water from Flint

Stuffed toys from kids lost under his watch
8190 2018-11-21 16:59:23 No no no! My son’s in oil and gas and we need HIGHER prices. Are you crazy???
8191 2018-11-21 16:59:22 Le projet est bien, mais comment on fait pour les retraités, les familles qui ont qu'un petit salaire? La peur engendre la violence, ne faudrait t-il pas repousser l'augmentation du gaz oil à 2020? Le temps de travailler à un plan B 1 sur un propre pas chère!
8192 2018-11-21 16:59:22 Try strawberry spinach salad, with homemade dressing: little cooking oil, sugar and white vinegar, Delicious.
8193 2018-11-21 16:59:18 Saudi Arabia does NOT set oil prices!
Saudi Arabia does NOT set oil prices!
Saudi Arabia does not set oil prices!!!!
Got it, yet???
8194 2018-11-21 16:59:17 Broad market is relatively weak for now looking at the oil price rally, may catch up  #WTI #crude #oil $CL $ES $SPY
8195 2018-11-21 16:59:15 You really ought to educate yourself more about #EV batteries. Do you think refining oil is pollution free?

And EV batteries enjoy second lives in storage applications, and after that are nearly 100% recyclable.
8196 2018-11-21 16:59:15 おやすみおいるぅ～ねるふわ～
8197 2018-11-21 16:59:13 SA practically shut down the fracking industry last time they sold cheap oil.
8198 2018-11-21 16:59:12 It is difficult to imagine going lower, but with you anything is possible. The life of a journalist for cheap oil. What would you sell your children for? A Trump Tower in Moscow? We could do without Saudi oil, but then you wouldn’t get your cut.
8199 2018-11-21 16:59:12 Amla ka oil lgaya kro followers py 7 din me girna bnd
8200 2018-11-21 16:59:04 @BABSFREY, you are right, Saudi agreed to reduce the volume they are pumping into the market to avoid another oil price crash. Maybe Trump misinterpreted that move and CBC might be right, after all,  it is Trump 
8201 2018-11-21 16:59:00 ARKしよ
8202 2018-11-21 16:58:59 Crude $wti up $2 and $weed and #potstocks up. It’s not really rocket science just oil cycles. They are correlated whether or not u like it.
8203 2018-11-21 16:58:55 Oil is a commodity so it will change daily so they probably just do a monthly average.
8204 2018-11-21 16:58:53 Will you please tweet a joke about how trump is thanking saudis for low gas prices, yet they only account for 11% of oil imports.. 40% is from our good friends Canada.
8205 2018-11-21 16:58:51 Today is the best day! 
-Baby girl is doing great
-Getting an oil change 
-Getting a package delivered for Bryn ( which contains the cutest clothes)
- Had Starbucks 
& it’s only 11 
8206 2018-11-21 16:58:50 Come on America, he is thanking people who killed and dismembered a member of the free press! We know he hates the media but this is outrageous. Also thank Canada since 40% of your oil comes from here. We want our good neighbours back. We miss our American partnership .

8208 2018-11-21 16:58:47 Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
8209 2018-11-21 16:58:47 Saudi gots nuthin’ to do with it anymore dweeb. We only import 11% of our oil supplies these days. You are just thinking it’s gonna help you w covering up for MBS. 
8210 2018-11-21 16:58:46 ASAP ? Back in the mid 90's, had we stopped  then (Burning fossil fuels) the future of our race would be in question because of nuclear proliferation. Continuing  the burning of oil has guaranteed that future will be at the very least, hard to breath in, eventually impossible.
8211 2018-11-21 16:58:44 You should thank the American oil producers in Texas. Always remember America First.
8212 2018-11-21 16:58:44 Brent crude at $ 64.38 per barrel, down from 80 + just a few weeks ago. You never know which direction oil prices may go!
8213 2018-11-21 16:58:43 I still think Reinhardt trade was mandated by Kevin Lowe since he Griffin played for the Oil Kings.  The Eberle trade and Lucic signing were total "what were you thinking" moments.  Hall trade I would make every time.
8214 2018-11-21 16:58:42 You again deflect from current failures, which you have pulled the country through the same shithole. Your not responsible for oil price reductions. Stop attempting to make out it’s all you it isn’t your a failure plain and simple just a failure.
8215 2018-11-21 16:58:40 I added enough chili oil to this stir fry to make my shitty co worker consider reporting me for crying again  it's very tasty. My eyes are watering *sniffle*
8216 2018-11-21 16:58:40 This is not true. There is a glut of oil on the market. US oil production highest in the world right now.
8217 2018-11-21 16:58:39 The thing is, it's not about the oil or the economy..it's about what the Saudi's and Russia has on @realDonaldTrump or what they have paid him for but no doubt there is a big skeleton waiting to be found. Don't listen to #FakeNews #FoxNews do ur own due diligence. #WakeUpAmerica
8218 2018-11-21 16:58:33 Soul to the devil  for a cheap barrel of oil & to brag about it!  Without morals this country!
8219 2018-11-21 16:58:32 A new #oil market price based on the agreed number of political foes & various critics sacrificed to the unholy trinity of #Trump #Putin & #MohammedBinSalman.
Maybe each embassy can be fitted with a #Chacmool on which to carry out the sacrifice to the oil god. #HappyThanksgiving
8220 2018-11-21 16:58:27 If we break with Saudi Arabia, look for gas to go up to about $10.00 a gallon, which is what MUSLIM OBAMA WANTED WHEN HE WAS IN OFFICE. 
 ALSO OIL WILL GET ABOUT $150 PER BARREL. THIS IS WHAT THE RADICAL LEFT WANTS. DO YOU???
NOT ME!!!
 I'M PAYING $1.98.9 per gallon now.
8221 2018-11-21 16:58:25 Condemning @IcelandFoods for making commercial decisions about stock over Christmas seems churlish to me.
Their recently added vegan products are ground breaking & their stance on palm oil admirable.
Seems they're being villified for not doing EVERYTHING.
8222 2018-11-21 16:58:21 I’m old enough to remember when “Arms for Oil” was a thing, now in Trump’s MAGA it’s gone literal.
8223 2018-11-21 16:58:19 Its So Cal, plenty of hybrids. Thanks Permian and Bakke Shale oil
8224 2018-11-21 16:58:19 How gross and disgusting is this!?!? You're thanking the Saudi's for low oil prices, they are not the reason for low oil prices, high production is, bytnyou grovel and thank them anyway. You are pathetically weak, a national disgrace!
8225 2018-11-21 16:58:17 Deepika hair ki oil petadam aapeste bavunu
8226 2018-11-21 16:58:16 The United States is now the world’s largest oil producer. He’s not protecting your oil or gas prices. It’s about Trump’s business deals.
8227 2018-11-21 16:58:16 what if we also embraced less oil dependence and encourage technology for sustainable energy?
8228 2018-11-21 16:58:10 Now Trump is asking the Saudis to further reduce oil prices. Who's the next person he will allow to be slaughtered for this quid pro quo?
8229 2018-11-21 16:58:10 We only get around 9% of our oil from Saudi Arabia.

That's what you're arguing will collapse the US if it's reduced or removed.
8230 2018-11-21 16:58:09 @realDonaldTrump Well I hope the Saudis are using some of that cheaper oil to lubricate your backside while you bend over for them...wait, no I don't...no lube for you.
8231 2018-11-21 16:58:09 Trump-Thanked-Saudi-Arabia-in-a-Tweet-for-Lower-OIL-prices-after-admitting-MBS-directed-the-assassination-of-a-@washingtonpost Journalist
8232 2018-11-21 16:58:09 Have you forgotten the oil embargo. Saudis are hoodwinking this President
8233 2018-11-21 16:58:07 Saudi blood oil is bought by private companies. Quebec does not buy Saudi oil. Why do you hate the free market?
8234 2018-11-21 16:58:07 Trading blood for oil. Haven't you gone about as low as a human being possibly could?
8235 2018-11-21 16:58:06 Trump has helped destroy common decency. US morals (those who think Colin Kaepernick is unpatriotic for objecting to race crimes). Lives of indigenous people by approving oil pipelines across their land. Natural parks by allowing people to drill in them. Enough?
8236 2018-11-21 16:58:06 not only that, it affects the IRA of anyone with oil stocks as part of their portfolio. When oil is down the market is down.  That's how I seem to remember it.  Whenever oil was lowest, my IRA was suffering badly
8237 2018-11-21 16:58:04 Sorry, was busy looking for that oil to service your engine whilst trying to read your tweet...

Im done..iv got the right oil...tobata basa here?? 
8238 2018-11-21 16:58:03 @JohnGormleyShow listening to you sounds like you believe Trudeau runs the country on his own volition & not the puppet of the banks, big oil & multinational corps. Hmm! Could it be all these entities are benefitting from the price WCS? low royalties. They sell to themselves.
8239 2018-11-21 16:57:59 The biggest reason is that oil just isn’t that big an input anymore. We just need less oil per $ of gdp.
8240 2018-11-21 16:57:57 Hm. I’d like to read this too, but there’s no way I’m re-subscribing to the Oil and Wente. If you manage to get the bullet points, please tag me.
8241 2018-11-21 16:57:54 There’s something very wrong when consumers get a break on dropping oil prices because the President refuses to sanction the Saudis.  This is all very perverse.   @penneyewart @GarrettRuby @pommyGinger @leonardbartolo2 @maddow @lawrence @JoyAnnReid @chrislhayes @arimelber
8242 2018-11-21 16:57:54 Lol i buy 90 tho... U there ah pree 87. Might as well just put cooking oil in ur tank
8243 2018-11-21 16:57:52 @shadowtaps @realDonaldTrump climate change increases heat waves,wildfires,sea level rise,hurricanes,flooding,drought & shortages of clean water. Burning oil,coal,gas release carbon dioxide into our atmosphere. This is why planet has warmed. It’s serious.
8244 2018-11-21 16:57:51 At last!  US foreign policy is revealed!  Trump proudly reveals the secret foundations of America’s policies: oil.
8245 2018-11-21 16:57:50 Was that the exchange made? A journalists death for lower oil prices???
8246 2018-11-21 16:57:50 Trump better do a 180 on Saudi Arabia & hold the Crown Prince accountable or he will lose a large swath of his support! Everyone expects that America should stand on the right side of this tragedy & show the world that we behold our values over low oil prices or gold for weapons.
8247 2018-11-21 16:57:46 Oil is getting lower because President Obama signed a bill to release American oil reserves, not because of #fake45!  #TheResistance
8248 2018-11-21 16:57:45 ひさびさにがっつりlolした
8249 2018-11-21 16:57:45 #Trump : "Right now, we have oil prices in great shape. I'm not going to destroy the world economy and I'm not going to destroy the economy for our country by being foolish with Saudi Arabia... It's about America First."
8250 2018-11-21 16:57:45 おねんねすゆ
8251 2018-11-21 16:57:39 Maybe he's going for 4 cents a barrel, or whatever price that makes power generation by burning oil cheaper than solar power.
8252 2018-11-21 16:57:37 I try to eat mostly stuff that is protein based. If you bake thinly sliced vegetables in olive oil they crisp and taste like chips with way less carbs. I don’t do like a cheat day, but if I slip a little I forgive myself and start over the next day.
8253 2018-11-21 16:57:36 Yes! Damage the economies of Texas and other oil producing states! Punish the #MAGA red hat wearers!
8254 2018-11-21 16:57:32 40% of our oil is from Canada. Saudi Arabia is 11%
8255 2018-11-21 16:57:31 The global market is responsible for lower oil prices, not Trump.  Do you think the Saudis keep prices low because they “like” Trump?  On one of Trump’s visits the Prince was basically laughing in his face while Trump showed photos of hotel development in Saudi Arabia.
8256 2018-11-21 16:57:25 We are still blinded by...the oil company kickbacks...tell the truth for once you snakeoil saleman
8257 2018-11-21 16:57:24 I thought we got our oil from Canada. IsmTrump the stupidest man alive?
8258 2018-11-21 16:57:23 @potus #MoronAlert -let's thank #Canada, the country from whom we get nearly half of our oil. We get roughly 10% from the Saudis.
8259 2018-11-21 16:57:21 Trump celebrates low oil prices, tweeting 'Thank you to Saudi Arabia' - Washington Post
8260 2018-11-21 16:57:19 I rub olive oil
8261 2018-11-21 16:57:19 Really Saudi oil is only 11%
8262 2018-11-21 16:57:16 and honestly even though they missed this a week ago when I was in there, I’d have like to cuz I do like that shop, but I didn’t know it’d be more than an oil change and I needed to be out in time for work in what is now 35 minutes.
8263 2018-11-21 16:57:13 Shon once you try not washing for like several weeks it’s gonna get addicting and you will end up like me forgetting when I last washed it but confident that it’s not gonna be soon it’s for her health she needs to rest in her own oil
8264 2018-11-21 16:57:13 BLOOD FOR OIL. That is all this is, and Congress needs to find their SPINES and hold him and his cabal responsible. We have the directions to GET RID OF THIS GOVT!!!
8265 2018-11-21 16:57:12 But Canada doesn’t control world oil prices. The Saudis do. If the Saudis cut prices, Canada has to follow or lose market share in the U.S. 
8266 2018-11-21 16:57:12 With respect to 2), isn't DJT shooting his own foot by encouraging lower oil prices? I understand US suppliers' break-even is at around $60.
8267 2018-11-21 16:57:10 Chick-fil-A Tomball Texas, chicken sandwich over cooked, very dark and saturated with oil, im hoping this is the outlier
8268 2018-11-21 16:57:08 Much of the lower prices can be traced to increased production in the U.S. and a glut of oil in Canada.
8269 2018-11-21 16:57:07 You have no clue where we even get our oil from. Man, you are beyond unqualified. Why don’t you thank Canada? We get most of our oil from them. #RakeAmericaGreatAgain
8270 2018-11-21 16:57:06 Loving the drama myself, gotta go for both beard oil and moisturizer for the face
8271 2018-11-21 16:57:05 Further, @algore got Clinton to lease oil fields to Hammer, after Costing the Earth & starting Green Chemistry Awards, which I helped establish in 1996 working in DC. Gore's hypocrisy on climate & Gore Sr's anti civil rights are legit criticisms.
8272 2018-11-21 16:57:04 Yet you as MY SENATOR, do nothing when POTUS praises Saudi Arabia about lowering oil pricing but they kill a news reporter. That the legacy U want to go out on? U alled out administrations on wastes, but we wasted $210,000,000 on border issues, with the CARAVAN.  U diid nothing.!
8273 2018-11-21 16:57:04 What trump also fails to see is that the Permian basin has bypassed in supply bottlenecks and is cranking out oil at insane production levels. Prices are lowering because of the US. It makes his tweet to Saudi even worse. Thanking them for American production ?
8274 2018-11-21 16:57:01 Argan Oil and JBCO w/ Peppermint Oil will really make your hair flourish
8275 2018-11-21 16:56:57 I can imagine how much suya this certificate was used for . May N200 suya Bc the oil map no too spread round the paper.
8276 2018-11-21 16:56:54 Do we get oil from them? Do they buy apartments from Trump? If yes to both or either, "oops".
8277 2018-11-21 16:56:53 Hi Jenny, we’re so sorry to hear this. Please contact our Instant Oil Customer Care team at 1-800-327-8242 or via email at customercare@valvoline.com. They can get more information and provide assistance.
8278 2018-11-21 16:56:50 The state of the American car companies are still oil based, whereas Japanese cars et al are more forward thinking in mpg, safety and caring for their customers and the environment and take that decision away from Saudis
8279 2018-11-21 16:56:47 That he thinks Americans will go along with this amazes me. A human life for cheaper oil...
8280 2018-11-21 16:56:41 Low means more. More means less. Soon we won’t have any oil left. Conserve what we have.
8281 2018-11-21 16:56:41 The question is will the CoP 24 make a statement on Palm oil? Or Real Politics will take precedence? Unless alternative to Palm Oil is found. Orangutans are just a sad casualty in the process of making money!
8282 2018-11-21 16:56:40 Trump is celebrating the fact that the price of oil has fallen to thirty pieces of silver
8283 2018-11-21 16:56:39 Now now that’s oil the liberals need in the next election.   It’s not evil oil like Alberta Oil.
8284 2018-11-21 16:56:33 9% of our oil comes from Saudi Arabia, 40% from Canada. trump disses Canada and embraces the Saudis. Anyone see something wrong with this picture?
8285 2018-11-21 16:56:32 How many journalists does MBS need to murder before we get free oil?  #murica
8286 2018-11-21 16:56:32 What in the world is going on with gas prices? They haven't gone down at all. They should be about a dollar cheaper since the price of oil has gone down.
8287 2018-11-21 16:56:30 Just proves Mr President it's all about the Money not the American people.  We don't need Saudia Arabia for oil. We have Our own
8288 2018-11-21 16:56:29 We need to get off oil period.
8289 2018-11-21 16:56:29 Protective styles. Trims. Castor oil
8290 2018-11-21 16:56:27 Saudi Arabia does not set world oil prices and their minimal influence does not justify the USA doing business with murderers/dictators.
8291 2018-11-21 16:56:23 I don’t know if they have a plan for a bitumen spill? It would sink to the ocean floor, what would they do? When they can’t even clean up oil that’s on the surface of the water.. sometimes the environment HAS to come before money #saveouroceans #saveourenvironment @JustinTrudeau
8292 2018-11-21 16:56:21 brushed my teeth w cbd oil and now i can c into the future
8293 2018-11-21 16:56:13 American are friends of oil producing country and give protection to saudi kindome and can kill any one including osama
8294 2018-11-21 16:56:11 Hi Redgren, I’d be interested in your opinion why oil prices went down if you have a better explanation.
8295 2018-11-21 16:56:05 ยากดูจัง
8296 2018-11-21 16:56:03 Where are you getting $82 for WTI oil? lol. Fake news, Donald. Come on man.
8297 2018-11-21 16:56:01 Hardly. You’re a liar. As far as I’m concerned, you have #JamalKhashoggi ‘s blood on your hands. All the cheap oil in the world is not worth that.
8298 2018-11-21 16:55:56 Oh my yes! Many times. You put slaw, a pickle and cayenne ("avec all"). Plus the fries are so good. Sugar in the oil. French Canadians know how to eat bad.
8299 2018-11-21 16:55:55 Every time Americans fill their tanks with this “cheap oil” gasoline a few drops of Jamal Khashoggi’s blood is mixed in.  America has surrendered it’s soul to this greedy devil.
8300 2018-11-21 16:55:52 Most of our oil comes from Canada anyway. Saudi's are what, 10% of imports? Cutting them off would not be a huge cost long term. And well worth it.
8301 2018-11-21 16:55:51 To be fair, Norway is probably the only oil exporting country that doesn’t murder its own people...
8302 2018-11-21 16:55:49 What are they dipping it in, acid? An who fills the peanut oil that high for it to splash out? An who just dunks it in like a donut? I know they are promoting safety but come on.
8303 2018-11-21 16:55:48 so we don't have to import oil from saudi, i think we should drill more here, especially in California.
8304 2018-11-21 16:55:47 Everything has a price to pay the tax cuts is ski rocking the national debt and now cheap oil is an insult to the moral of the American people AMERICA will be no longer respected without the values we used to lead.
8305 2018-11-21 16:55:46 Bio oil??
8306 2018-11-21 16:55:45 Glad you made those points, I suspected same thing. Any oil spill is regrettable but the negative impacts of this one are/were negligible and it was caught quite quickly.
Life goes on, let's focus on real and big problems and avoid trying to make hay out of little ones.
8307 2018-11-21 16:55:41 WRONG........Oil prices need to rise sharply. This is bad for the economy and the planet. 
Its cuts 401k spending, hurts retirees.
Please remove yourself from the oil business.
8308 2018-11-21 16:55:38 We get about 2% of our oil from SA. What a big tax cut!
8309 2018-11-21 16:55:37 As for Venezuela, that nation has been in crisis and was even used as an example for Nigeria to heed as far back as the 2012 subsidy protests.

It was a no-brainer that a fall in oil prices would lead to a crisis in Venezuela.
8310 2018-11-21 16:55:37 The Saudis are more trouble that their oil is worth! Rising Oil prices is likely a Good thing as it might wake people wake up to alternative energy sources,I remember a speech by REX TILLERSON to XOM Shareholders, few yrs ago outlining how CO2 Emissions can’t be halted, a chance?
8311 2018-11-21 16:55:33 Yeah, boo! I’m not sure what “thing” you’re talking about, but it’s done good for me (unlike coconut oil that seems to work on everyone else)
8312 2018-11-21 16:55:33 OIL price getting  lower phony way !  just for few weeks that you hope pepole will forget #MBSIsAMurderer your dead  wrong  !!!  #MohammedBinSalman crime is associated with to your fammily name & history forEVER ! it #MBS & HIS CRIMES will never  go far from #Trump name & wealth
8313 2018-11-21 16:55:31 On this oil early 
8314 2018-11-21 16:55:29 You really make me sick! You're excusing your lax response to the crimes committed by @Saudi by saying the oil price went down? Where's your moral compass?
8315 2018-11-21 16:55:26 in the purse. They produce terrorism and oil. He's all but wiped out terrorism in 2 short years. They're influence in oil, is massively waning, because Canada has enormous amounts and are just now figuring out how to export it.
8316 2018-11-21 16:55:24 Yes they are but you don’t drop the turkey in the oil like that. You slowly submerge.
8317 2018-11-21 16:55:23 Man, if only that came packaged with our dignity. Alas, it does not, because apparently supporting the barbaric, animalistic regime of Saudi Arabia is more important: a country where non-believers, critics, and gays alike are executed. 

But yay, oil prices are down :/
8318 2018-11-21 16:55:23 The one selling you cheap oil in return for Trump Investments and lifting sanctions, you mean?
8319 2018-11-21 16:55:22 Canada supplies the US with more oil than do the Saudis, yet trump is horrendously nasty to Canada and cozies up to the Saudis??  No bailout cash involved??  Hmmmmm.
8320 2018-11-21 16:55:21 "Less harmful than an oil spill" is thankfully not the only bar to clear. Youtube's lax stance on copyright means it gets richer at the expense of smaller creators, and that's not right.
8321 2018-11-21 16:55:16 Tip: brussel sprouts can clog a disposal. Google it. If it happens use dishwashing liquid to remove oil.
8322 2018-11-21 16:55:13 Low oil prices hurts domestic producers. If there is no profit, producers will stop producing. Great for the US environment, bad for the extractors.
8323 2018-11-21 16:55:12 Terrorists and terrorism would vanish in next 5 years. No oil  for mslms to create problems across the world. I hope world would be peacefu
8324 2018-11-21 16:55:11 We get more oil from Canada.
8325 2018-11-21 16:55:09 always has to find something to brag about.  Seems to have gotten quiet on stock market.  Also fails to mention that his Iranian sanctions were reason oil popped to $82.
8326 2018-11-21 16:55:08 On CBS news show this mornining, M. Morell, gave explanation that Saudi Arabia helps us keep Iran in check. How about oil? He said that Trump should have done "some" sanctions to let them know if they committed a second offense then (what?). He said CIA findings are usually kept
8327 2018-11-21 16:55:03 Alberta provides the funds for all the other provinces to receive funds but at below $20 a barrel for our oil that can’t last forever
8328 2018-11-21 16:55:00 @realDonaldTrump We have to decide between oil price and American dignity, which is important for us. Of course, if there is any word called dignity in Trump's dictionary.
8329 2018-11-21 16:54:59 voglio quella felpa della johnson’s baby oil la devo trovare da qualche parte
8330 2018-11-21 16:54:56 to prevent damage to environment, there are much bigger countries- than us- who have decided, for ex. not to do deep sea oil exploration. they stopped it to be ecologically responsible. our investors should take heed. Just stop grabbing trees and be ecologically responsibile.
8331 2018-11-21 16:54:56 I am never feeling myself more than when everything is freshly shaved and I'm smothered in coconut oil
8332 2018-11-21 16:54:55 Hahahaha

Why are WE buying Arab Oil if WE are the biggest producer of Oil in the world?  

America 1st???  Don’t think so Donald.  

Perhaps sucking up to Saudi Arabia , a Murdering & Criminal Rogue Nation shouldn’t be your priority.   

#SaudiTerrorism

#AmericanValues
8333 2018-11-21 16:54:52 #USA turns its back to international community justice because #OIL ... #ThankYou #POTUSTrump #MAGA. 
What's a little internal #torture & #murder amongst allies #Putin is really good at it.
8334 2018-11-21 16:54:51 Cough Murder Cover Up Cough here’s cheaper oil cough
8335 2018-11-21 16:54:51 159 litre benzin değil, mazotu,fuel oil, jet yakıtı, lpg var.hepsi benzin olmuyor, olamaz. Ama hepsinin değerini hesaplarsan, çıkış değer işe satış değer arasında yüzde yüz ellilik fark var.
8336 2018-11-21 16:54:50 Yet Justin Trudeau the champion of women’s rights won’t build energy east and stop importing Saudi oil.   One of the biggest offenders to human rights, even worse for female rights.  Guess e values environmentalists ahead of women
8337 2018-11-21 16:54:50 Cut em small before putting to already boiling water, add tsp salt, sprig of rosemary and tbsp olive oil. Should take about 15 mins. Drain add lots of butter and a bit of cream or milk. Mash with fork and add a little minced roasted garlic.
8338 2018-11-21 16:54:49 It’s very clear that he thank Saudi Arabia for its control of oil price not for how much they export to US !!
8339 2018-11-21 16:54:48 What lower oil prices because up here in Washington gas prices are rising
8340 2018-11-21 16:54:47 Considering we import only 11% of our oil from Saudi’s Arabia it was more of a blow job than a thank you
8341 2018-11-21 16:54:47 They only give us less than 11% of our oil, while Canada gives us 40%, yet we treat Canada with such disrespect.
8342 2018-11-21 16:54:44 Half of an avocado, teaspoon of coconut oil, some hair good conditioner. Mix together and place in your hair for nutritional meal for your hair. You’re welcome.
8343 2018-11-21 16:54:42 gave it up time back akh. the oil they use is not clean, they probably change it every month + you don’t even know if it’s chicken or pigeon. think about why it’s so cheap, cos it may not even be chicken
8344 2018-11-21 16:54:41 Apparently what you *didn't* learn was that the White House should be inhabited by a decent caring person and not a Saudi apologist who condones murder.

Country over party, Lindsey. And humanity over oil.
8345 2018-11-21 16:54:37 Kya ho gaya to. Wo oil ke liye murderers ki side hai aur hum vikas ke promise ke liye.  Sabki same story hai.
8346 2018-11-21 16:54:31 Oil prices have not been over 60/gal since 2015.  That 60.00 was in 2017 under Trump administration.
8347 2018-11-21 16:54:25 US Saudi relations have been consistently very strong for decades. 

Main thing that’s changed is US geopolitical interests are increasingly in Asia, not the Middle East: 

1. Massive economic expansion of China
2. US now world’s largest oil producer
8348 2018-11-21 16:54:22 Let’s produce all of our own oil here in U.S.!  
8349 2018-11-21 16:54:21 key to clear skin: water & sweet almond oil
8350 2018-11-21 16:54:20 For starters, Brazil was already in economic turmoil over the hosting of the World Cup in 2014.

The fall in oil prices was just the final straw that broke the camel's back (partly because production costs in Brazil were also amongst the highest in the world).
8351 2018-11-21 16:54:20 Oil and Gas sector has lost Trillion dollars keep THAT in mind as they malign renewables , landowners whose land they want to seize ,environmentalists  they continue to ignore Climate Change= health side effects=their lack proper sight  billions they get subsidies from tax payers
8352 2018-11-21 16:54:17 I guess lower oil prices are worth the brutal murder of a journalist
8353 2018-11-21 16:54:16 Thank you because the oil in the gas is killing us in California you guys know we're poor out here but the hell's going on
8354 2018-11-21 16:54:14 Do you know how much oil is 20%
Do the math. 
Then you wander why Trump is calling you fake news.
8355 2018-11-21 16:54:12 Let's say that you do and let's say that Saudi government doesn't sell oil to Russia. Let's say you dethrone MBS. What's after that? You leave us just like you did with Iraqies.
8356 2018-11-21 16:54:10 Wah...kisi ko koi problem nahi hai..aur raha sawal so called Islamic terrorism ka to ye West creation hai take Middle east me oil rich region me dominance banaye aur new world order jo ultimate goal hai !
8357 2018-11-21 16:54:06 The logic of this president baffled me, he blamed California for mismanaging federal property and defended the Saudis because he needed their oil that caused the change in climate which is causing California to burn and Texas to flood. Am I the only ones that see it this way?
8358 2018-11-21 16:54:04 The oil &petrol business is very risky. I don't know details. But there are many factors. And sometimes you need to walk away and wait for a better opportunity. BUT I think with this deal the selling price was inflated. Many connected people would have scored millions from it.
8359 2018-11-21 16:54:01 Yup.. oil industry in Canada  is off  for sure.. 
$ 12 / barrel..
What is amazing that lots of 
" canadians" are buying  his BS.
8360 2018-11-21 16:54:00 Make it thinner so it cooks evenly. Or smaller.

If u still want the size, the oil should be at slightly below medium heat. To give time for the heat to reach the centre.
8361 2018-11-21 16:53:59 You're letting the Saudis get away with murder!

No, they bought it fair and square. Paid for it with oil and apartments.
8362 2018-11-21 16:53:56 Then don't fill up until oil prices are much higher; in fact, pay more when you pump so we see your stupid outrage in $$$$$$$$$$
8363 2018-11-21 16:53:51 It's ok to murder someone as long as oil prices drop. ? POTUS, where are your morals
8364 2018-11-21 16:53:48 iyo soale wedi malah nyumbat pori2 malah jadi komedoan, sok tau sih iki 
kamu pake minyak zaitun opo me ? iki oleh sembarang minyak zaitun ta ? soale mau nggonku tulisan arab kabeh tp tulisane pure virgin oil jd yowes nekat.
8365 2018-11-21 16:53:48 Other that occasional outside forces, oil prices "always" drop in the winter due to lower demand. Simple economics. Why must you take credit for things that you aren't responsible for? Do you want to take credit for the DOW recently losing all of its 2018 gains?
8366 2018-11-21 16:53:42 Thank you Joy for acknowledging Canada and fact checking where most of oil comes from
8367 2018-11-21 16:53:42 This Thanksgiving I'm thankful that Trump hasn't traded my life for money and oil ...at least not yet ...or maybe he has.
8368 2018-11-21 16:53:40 I watched the video on the Neom Project a.k.a. Future 2030. MBS is no Nelson Mandela. Pulling off this vision requires a leader who isn't bombing children in Yemen, blocking supplies to 14 mill starving people. Saudi's oil should be a stranded asset not what MBS wants to sell.
8369 2018-11-21 16:53:39 Is it too late to shout out #Nissan for that free oil change last week just cause my daughter was cute ? No? Okay, thanks Nissan !!
8370 2018-11-21 16:53:38 3)With oil prices set low,at least d paycheck can now buy better stuff. Credit should belong to where credit is,thus the thanks from d Prez. 

It's only an American value,which d media seems hell bent on destroying,in their lust to bring down the Prez.
8371 2018-11-21 16:53:36 Oh no - onions in mine! Celery is what I had to take out because boyfriend hates celery. As far as mimicing the onion flavor, you could always infuse oil by sauteeing onion and tossing the bits (but it might make the stew rather fatty), or used minced onion vs. onion powder
8372 2018-11-21 16:53:32 Castor oil is where it’s at, I been on that wave for years.
8373 2018-11-21 16:53:30 @GrafRumford I seem to remember you had one brand of olive oil tested. I can’t recall which one. Thoughts?
8374 2018-11-21 16:53:28 40% of your oil comes from Canada and 11% from Saudi yet Trump bashes Canada at every opportunity
8375 2018-11-21 16:53:28 call me silly but I would rather pay more for oil if it means journalists don't have to be murdered and chopped to bits - it might help if @realDonaldTrump listened to the audio of that murder - maybe he should ask himself if he would feel the same if it were one of his children
8376 2018-11-21 16:53:26 cbd oil just saved the day
8377 2018-11-21 16:53:25 ADAM's the ultimate score, kid. No more grifts. No more scams. A monopoly on ADAM makes Standard Oil look like the Piggly Wiggly.
8378 2018-11-21 16:53:22 Indeed it is. But how can be made available for the billions that use palm oil with the current cost of algae oil. It's far too high in cost and you would have to make it in Malaysia for example where the palm oil is made keeping those in work. Or they will make more to undercut
8379 2018-11-21 16:53:18 It’s where you swish coconut oil round your teeth and it’s meant to whiten them! Haha
8380 2018-11-21 16:53:14 Pressure should be applied to King to remove his errant son. That would be a beginning? Saudi's rarely, if ever have been held accountable? Always about a few $'s & cheaper oil, very sad & pathetic. We fall back, Romans 1:21-34 pastime to wake up & speak truth, our values matter
8381 2018-11-21 16:53:10 Saudi Arabia had nothing to do with the recent drop in oil prices.
8382 2018-11-21 16:53:08 Ótimo, dá tempo pro oil se recuperar.
8383 2018-11-21 16:52:58 今週はオシロで波形とるひとしてましたね。
8384 2018-11-21 16:52:58 That may be so, but we also must be smart in knowing that if we do not work with the Saudis, we have so much more to risk aside from just oil prices. Surely you’re smart enough to know that.
8385 2018-11-21 16:52:55 The logic of this president baffled me, he blamed California for mismanaging federal property and defended the Saudis because he needed their oil that caused the change in climate which is causing California to burn and Texas to flood. Am I the only ones that see it this way?
8386 2018-11-21 16:52:49 He should be thanking Canada for oil.
8387 2018-11-21 16:52:47 The logic of this president baffled me, he blamed California for mismanaging federal property and defended the Saudis because he needed their oil that caused the change in climate which is causing California to burn and Texas to flood. Am I the only ones that see it this way?
8388 2018-11-21 16:52:40 @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi Tell AmericansTrump lies because he thinks the American people are stupid. He lies re the economy and the stock market cause he thinks we don't understand it. He lies re oil prices cause he thinks we don't know the Saudis don't set the price. Etc. Etc.
8389 2018-11-21 16:52:39 Closing prices: #Ftse100 1.47% #DAX 1.61% #CAC 1.03% #Estoxx50 1.29% #GBPUSD 1.2789 #EURGBP 0.8917 #GILTBUND 101.4 #Gold 0.56% #Oil 3.93%
8390 2018-11-21 16:52:39 I’m always complaining that products don’t have enough oil in them to be moisture products so 
8391 2018-11-21 16:52:38 I'm with you on the 1st point. The 2nd point is too opaque for me to test. What is known is that such full channel reversals are nothing new n oil (this, admittedly, was a wider channel than usual). Until proven otherwise, I'm calling this a COT driven reset (insert theory here).
8392 2018-11-21 16:52:38 The U.S. imports nearly 1 million barrels/day of crude oil from them. We sell them astronomical amounts of weaponry (e.g., 112 billion during Obama's eight years). Hmmm...could it possibly be a classic illustration of the old adage "Money talks...bulls**t walks"?
8393 2018-11-21 16:52:37 Hahahahaha to kya smje saffola oil ki jagah patanjali kacchi ghani ka oil use kre ..
8394 2018-11-21 16:52:36 Thanksgiving prep, pharmacist edition:

 oil change
___ ALL THE WORK for today & tomorrow rolled into today
___ pack  
___ family 
8395 2018-11-21 16:52:34 Oh yh, i cant find it but its on amazon somewhere. Its amazing bro rt black seed oil lets geddit
8396 2018-11-21 16:52:32 You can keep your blood oil and punish people for murder
8397 2018-11-21 16:52:31 Lastly, despite the fact that there are over 30 countries that export oil and over 90 that actually produce oil, you attempt to use Venezuela and Brazil to justify the indefensible.
8398 2018-11-21 16:52:28 All you people that say, "we care about more than money, we want Americans dignity back who cares about oil prices, etc" were probably the same ones crying and whining 3 years ago about gas prices.
8399 2018-11-21 16:52:27 Between you me and the lamppost we paid a dollar less a gallon under Ibama and the Saudis were choking on their oil. We don’t need their ducking oil.
8400 2018-11-21 16:52:26 Should've known better. @AdamMancini4 is long oil so never on earth was market gonna respond bearish to numbers like these. 
8401 2018-11-21 16:52:25 Liar. From the CBC: "Donald Trump has just tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to 'a big Tax Cut for America and the World!' In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia."
8402 2018-11-21 16:52:20 5. Add garlic and ginger to the oil as you stir, making sure they don’t burn
6. Slice three medium sized tomatoes
And add to the oil
7. Cover the pot and wait till tomatoes are soft(continue stirring occasionally to keep from burning)
8. Ounce tomatoes are soft, add tomato sauce
8403 2018-11-21 16:52:18 Only when the rums all gone.
8404 2018-11-21 16:52:17 We knew that the American "moral highground" was BS. With Trump we've confirmed it.
8405 2018-11-21 16:52:16 The believers of this @foxnews propaganda don't realize that this is akin to state media tactics of North Korea.

Trump nor SA have anything to do with the oil/gas prices.
8406 2018-11-21 16:52:15 So what's the ideal solution to this fucked up situation?  Please do enlighten me? Should they US stop buying oil from Saudi Arabia? We'll go to Russia and that's why you can't do shit. It's not because Trump is so in love with how MBS wears his dress!
8407 2018-11-21 16:52:14 CRUDE OIL

Iran is selling oil for $20 in the black market.

No reason to buy oil at $55 in the official market.
8408 2018-11-21 16:52:13 40% oil comes from Canada.
8409 2018-11-21 16:52:10 Think Ima get my oil changed today
8410 2018-11-21 16:52:06 Thanks from  President Trump.
the Iranian oil tankers who smuggle oil.
And do not let Iran sell even a drop of oil.
Thank you for your sanctions
8411 2018-11-21 16:52:06 It IS perfect! We're at the end of the hydrocarbon era; shale oil is expensive to extract and totally dependent on credit/debt to function. But America needs it so the money will flow to it like a river. If you are in LTO, lend to it, or an RI under it, you're set for life.
8412 2018-11-21 16:52:02 40% of our oil comes from Canada. Only 11% comes from Saudi Arabia. 

#MathIsHard 

MBS is a murderer and you are complicit.
8413 2018-11-21 16:51:59 Lower oil prices = DEAD American Journalist?
8414 2018-11-21 16:51:57 The old story about it being more dangerous coming out of a recession than going into it....and if we enter a second oil recession we are doomed.
8415 2018-11-21 16:51:57 How does American oil industry feel about this?

8417 2018-11-21 16:51:56 That’s the con the evil
The insanity the snake oil
The hate the deception 
The inciting violence 
The death the rage 
Hurt the killer
Right their
8418 2018-11-21 16:51:55 You should be ashamed of yourself as editor of the NEJM for printing these fish oil meta-analyses which are un-scientific and because you are ignorant on the subject of EPA and it counterfeits your opinion on "fish oil" you should do some reading before you abuse your position.
8419 2018-11-21 16:51:54 Correct me if I'm wrong but don't we get the most oil from Canada?
8420 2018-11-21 16:51:50 Were the military/industrial/oil industry oligarchs etc., there? Lets remember who our military works for.
8421 2018-11-21 16:51:47 Fun facts: Saudis retain ownership of their oil until sale to USA & other customers; American firms own most oil taken from the ground in Canada & sell it across what we used to call the world's longest undefended border to themselves.  In Canada, there's no state oilco.
8422 2018-11-21 16:51:45 Trump would like his base to believe that he has any influence over oil prices.
8423 2018-11-21 16:51:41 What song are you looking forward to hearing most at the @rmhsfootball tailgate at Lucas Oil?  Choose wisely...
8424 2018-11-21 16:51:36 I dunno, Trump opens his mouth?  Ask oil traders about that yesterday.
8425 2018-11-21 16:51:36 One of the darkly fascinating aspects of Trump Middle East rhetoric has been recycling past leftist critiques c 2001-2005 (no blood for oil in Iraq & basically same for Saudi) as his actual 2018 policy positions.
8426 2018-11-21 16:51:33 Why do we continue to support these jerks?  We have so much oil now due to fracking that we are exporting it! We should treat them the same as Iran and ban all sales to them except for food & medicine!
8427 2018-11-21 16:51:28 This is going to be great for America since we are now the largest oil producer. This reminds me of Kudlows argument that tariffs have been great because China has been hurt worse than we have.
8428 2018-11-21 16:51:24 So, committing a barbaric act like this is supposed to demonstrate that they are against terror? Figures that’s how trump would interpret it. Of course it’s obvious to everyone that SA’s oil and money mean more to him than the life of an “enemy of the people” journalist.
8429 2018-11-21 16:51:22 He can’t actually be astounded. Cow towing to the Saudi oil dictatorship is the one thing DT is doing that is consistent with all other modern presidents.
8430 2018-11-21 16:51:22 Do companies selling gas & products from Saudi oil bare any SJW criticism 4 selling because a US resident was killed?  What about u? Do u buy these products from Saudi? Has US citizens been all about Saudi?
8431 2018-11-21 16:51:22 40 % of your oil is supplied by the U.S., 40% supplied by your new enemy  Canada, 15% Latin America and the last bit your ally Saudi Arabia. Look into why Trump lies about the money the Trump family receives from the Saudis.
8432 2018-11-21 16:51:19 $amrn dew i take 3 fish oil pills 1200mg from Trader Joe daily and my Trig went down to 80, my hdl is now 98 and those pills r not small. no problem for me. i believe if people see benefits which may take 3-6 mos, compliance not issue imo
8433 2018-11-21 16:51:18 Just a tip from a Chef, to all the folks out there. Who are going to deep fry their Turkey. First, do it out side, in a cleared area. Second, oil, when it heats up. EXPANDS. so do not fill oil to the top. Approximately half full or a little over. If you fill it, it will overflow.
8434 2018-11-21 16:51:17 FYI... " Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia "
8435 2018-11-21 16:51:16 Post-Citizens United GOP is the best US lawmaking Saudi oil money can buy, it seems.
8436 2018-11-21 16:51:15 The great “live resin” rush. From plant to oil no cure no dry just freeze it and blast away!
8437 2018-11-21 16:51:10 Thank you, Ninna! Great idea  He did just have a good, long drink so I’m hoping he’ll make a “deposit” in litter box. I’ve given him a few small licks of coconut oil 

Wasn’t even thinking about the anesthesia drugs still being in his system. Appreciate your help 
8438 2018-11-21 16:51:09 Bloody Oil....Hitler would have been proud.
8439 2018-11-21 16:51:05 We don't get most of our oil from Saudi Arabia. You know that, right?
8440 2018-11-21 16:50:56 Always been about oil..All previous presidents. Not a Trump thing..Don’t be a sap
8441 2018-11-21 16:50:50 Red oil. 
8442 2018-11-21 16:50:45 Actually we buy three time more oil from Canada than SA. How about thanking them you fool.
8443 2018-11-21 16:50:45 All these years I hoped it was just a rumor but apparently we as a nation can be bought with oil.
#AnythingForABuck
8444 2018-11-21 16:50:41 Oh I forgot a raising health insurance cost when he sold us that “snake oil” saying it would lower the cost
8445 2018-11-21 16:50:39 Scotland could not and would not survive without the Union. Whiskey and a bit oil
8446 2018-11-21 16:50:38 Replace oil with heroin in these articles, and it's a more accurate idea of what we're talking about. It's killing the planet people. What more do we need to know?
8447 2018-11-21 16:50:32 Not have all that oil.
8448 2018-11-21 16:50:32 Yep, & gas prices are actually higher today than the day Trump took office. 
I paid a $1.99/gal. on Obama's last day & paid $2.43 on my way to work this morning. 
Heating fuel oil is also much higher now!
8449 2018-11-21 16:50:31 Rising US rates, IMF telling us we need 4.5% inflation (today’s print 5.1%), low economic growth, consumer under pressure, Rand stronger, oil lower, @SAReserveBank MPC mkt consensus appears to be a hike tomorrow... Surely not!? What do you say @MichaelJAvery? Double or nothing?
8450 2018-11-21 16:50:27 Looks like Santa rally is for crude oil.
8451 2018-11-21 16:50:26 To brim. Coast-to-coast to Coast-to-Coast. Terrible place don't come bad for immigrants. No more oil money. Very cold even in summer, much brrrr
8452 2018-11-21 16:50:25 Dear Mr. president people here in Louisiana will loose jobs, Louisiana is in America we need oil prices high to keep the balance in the economy
8453 2018-11-21 16:50:23 Trump thanking Saudi Arabia for lower oil prices is what is called "twisting the knife". He is an expert at backstabbing and revenge.
8454 2018-11-21 16:50:23 Fine and well, but 45 just sold out for Saudi Arabia and oil, so...
8455 2018-11-21 16:50:23 We only get 11% of our oil from the murderous Saudis.40% from Canada, our friend, neighbor, ally whom tRump denigrates. This is a travesty of massive proportions.
8456 2018-11-21 16:50:22 Between 2010 and 2015, the Pentagon used 105 billion barrels of petroleum on average, per year. 

The Pentagon is the single largest consumer of oil in the world. 

Consequently, the Pentagon is the grossest producer of pollution and carbon emissions in the planet.
8457 2018-11-21 16:50:22 Is it because you just covered for one of our biggest oil suppliers murdering a resident of our country?
8458 2018-11-21 16:50:22 F’ing snake oil salesman!

8461 2018-11-21 16:50:18 Of course, when this latest atrocity is drowned out by the next atrocity oil will be back up in a flash.
8462 2018-11-21 16:50:16 Instead of selling off our own oil, why can’t we use it? Is there realy a need for Saudi oil?
8463 2018-11-21 16:50:16 Oil money greases global corruption
8464 2018-11-21 16:50:16 It’s not really about oil prices either. That would be something for America. Trump cares only for Trump.
8465 2018-11-21 16:50:15 @alainapinto 495 north Lawrence completely shut down due to oil truck roll over.
8466 2018-11-21 16:50:13 Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.  So thank you, Canada!  Also, a fine country that does not order the killing of journalists.
8467 2018-11-21 16:50:12 Remember, it's only money that the #LyingPOTUS is interested in.

Also, US oil companies that have invested billions to produce oil here aren't so thrilled with the price of oil.

It is actually a drag on the US economy
8468 2018-11-21 16:50:12 You’re right. He denies climate change and supports big oil. He pretends it not connected . If he admitted it he’d have to loose millions in influence payments that benefit him personally.
8469 2018-11-21 16:50:12 Same thing happened to me. Lucky for me, my problem was with all the meds I was on for back pain. Got off meds with pot oil, don’t need the cpap anymore. Good luck.
8470 2018-11-21 16:50:11 Late harvest ( #Gallo ) - this olive oil comes from harvesting well matured olives. Smooth, sweet and with notes of dried fruit. #OliveOil
8471 2018-11-21 16:50:05 you do the oil i do the water
8472 2018-11-21 16:50:04 US / Trump has no control on oil prices, that is more of his BS
8473 2018-11-21 16:50:03 Trump could care less about arms sales and oil. He cares about Trump finances. He is the man who’s trying to sell out the world.
8474 2018-11-21 16:50:01 It's another distraction with a pittance of consideration in the offering up cheap oil to ease the minds of US citizens. How flippin asinine to think the majority of us are that stupid. OH, minority of us are, but at least not the Resistance.
8475 2018-11-21 16:50:00 Lately we have: bought a plug in hybrid vehicle, switched to a renewable energy supplier & I use a towel at work rather than loads of paper towels. Now need to switch to ethical soap rather than plastic contained gel and eliminate non-sustainable palm oil from my larder.
8476 2018-11-21 16:49:57 Yo uso savila en las noches o con gotitas de tree tea oil pero la verdad sólo estando desestresada se quitan

8482 2018-11-21 16:49:48 How to make Ghanaian Jollof Rice 

A Thread:
 1. Slice one large onion or two medium size onions              
2. Heat up oil and add onions once oil is hot
3. Cook oil for about six minutes on medium heat (covered) or until lightly brown.
4. Finely chop fresh garlic and ginger
8483 2018-11-21 16:49:47 Gregcoti finally came in useful! I will not be buying that expensive peanut oil this year to deep fry my Cajun turkey! @DanLeBatardShow
8484 2018-11-21 16:49:46 You want Trump to go against Saudi Arabia because you know Saudi Arabia would stop oil production and lead to extreme shortages and higher prices and that would Collapse the system and he would get the blame. Democrats blame others, wake up!
8485 2018-11-21 16:49:43 You should watch the documentary ''The secret of the seven sisters''. from Al-Jazeerah TV. You people inflict terrorism and war on the regions where you wish and expect trillion dollar's minerals/oil.
8486 2018-11-21 16:49:43 I'm gonna get myself @badt_BOI_  Unbothered T-shirt , as well as the  beard oil before 2018 is over
8487 2018-11-21 16:49:41 Saudi Arabia just cut production 500k a day to raise the price of oil & encouraged other OPEC countries to do so also to raise the price.After promising to keep pumping extra to offset the oil we would be embargoing from Iran this summer. So they are playing trump, not honourable
8488 2018-11-21 16:49:40 どりーま、VJは夜さんに頑張ってもらう。私は補欠VJ。いろいろ頑張っているので楽しみにしていてください。
8489 2018-11-21 16:49:38 Not if you live in Alaska. We need higher oil prices higher!!!!!!
8490 2018-11-21 16:49:38 So tell me about the 3000 that died on September 11 by 12 Saudi's on the planes that hit the twin towers...did they play the game and get what they deserved to? Saudi Arabia is a terrorist country that happens to give us cheap oil as long as we disregard our morals.
8491 2018-11-21 16:49:38 I am so sorry but, you see, b/c Congress ppl who have been in power for Decades & Past Presidents got us so dependent on Saudi Arabia both thru oil & also on the War on Terror, we cannot do much.  If we stop arma sales, rhey will just buy from Russia or China.

But nice try.
8492 2018-11-21 16:49:36 Better yet, quit importing oil and keep the US oil and gas sector active until renewables becomes the norm.  The low gas prices drive more of Trump's base out of work than coal.  Most of Texas is a MAGA person and all of us work in or on the fringes of oil and gas.
8493 2018-11-21 16:49:35 Guy.  Sorry I meant I wish #POTUS Would just go and play golf..remember Americians work and provide for their families in the oil industry
8494 2018-11-21 16:49:35 2)Exponentially coz as each in d supply chain-from oil tankers to even  flour,needs oil,will ADD on d increases charged by supply chains to  consumers.

In d end,d monthly pay check cant cover everything,even for media execs  that spits on PrezTrump & US-KSA alliance.

8496 2018-11-21 16:49:25 @KySportsRadio amongst our many similarities we also share the lack of attention to oil changes  I’m on 5% and hoping I can catch a black Friday deal on a good change hahahahha totally not a thing but I’m hoping they have mercy on me #KSRchatter

8498 2018-11-21 16:49:22 I'd pay more for oil if it meant  murderers weren't canonized!
8499 2018-11-21 16:49:20 This is another lie. Based on business analysis price of oil is stabilizing due to the fact US is producing more oil. Currently, US is the #1 produces of oil. In addition, Iran is selling on the black market, Russia, & Saudis are producing oil.
8500 2018-11-21 16:49:18 My mornjng nervs have been horrific again. I tried switching to CBD oil, instead of CBD isolate and I do not think it is working 
I have had one decent night of sleep in 8 days and it’s fucking with me
8501 2018-11-21 16:49:17 ตลกร้ายจริงๆ จังหวะดีเหลือเกิน
8502 2018-11-21 16:49:13 That's not his argument. It's that the US has looked the other way when dixtators did their bidding. The Cold War period is replete with examples. And US-Saudi policy goes back into the creation of Saudi Arabia as a state, which was largely a function of the discovery of oil.
8503 2018-11-21 16:49:10 Every President has been in bed with Saudi Arabia, the oil lobby has unlimited amounts of money to throw at politicians on both sides.
8504 2018-11-21 16:49:09 We could totally survive without Saudi oil!  But Trump family can’t survive without them due to financial ties. So who is he protecting by accepting their murderous acts? #Trump
8505 2018-11-21 16:49:09 It’s not just oil we want. Listen to @realDonaldTrump he wants $$$. Sell our US soul for arms deals to the Saudi. Shameful
8506 2018-11-21 16:49:07 Wow, Fox News is all in for "its a tough world but we need the oil."  So surprising! #KhashoggiMurder
8507 2018-11-21 16:49:06 It's no coincidence that the murderous dictatorship were supporting just lowered oil prices for us
8508 2018-11-21 16:49:05 ...in more than 3 years.  Falling oil prices also hurt the US oil industry.  It is possible that lower prices could be a net drag on the US economy.  I believe this tweet is the President trying to justify turning a blind eye to Saudi Arabia murdering a journalist by giving...
8509 2018-11-21 16:49:04 Plastic is as bad as palm oil if not worse and we practically can’t escape from either but we can always try to reduce how much we use !!!
8510 2018-11-21 16:49:03 オイルbotって何⁇とよく聞かれますが、…オイルはオイルですYO
8511 2018-11-21 16:49:03 I think getting rid of all the taxes and implementing a Land Value Tax (LVT) could be a good idea. Then people holding all the income producing land & exploiting the earth's resources (oil, forests, precious metals etc) would support the rest of the populace.
8512 2018-11-21 16:49:02 11 percent of our oil comes from the Saudis, treasonweasel. 54 percent comes from the Canadians, who you can stop insulting.
8513 2018-11-21 16:48:55 It's not just oil or money.  Trump normalizing harsh penalties for journalists who speak out/write the truth about a political power.  Dangerous precident for inside the USA
8514 2018-11-21 16:48:55 Think about it: to sustain their oil they're buying it.
8515 2018-11-21 16:48:54 It just came down in the last week to $2.82, was $2.99 AFTER labor day.
It was $2.25 when Donnie small hands fu~^*d everything up.
Booming economy? If you own an oil well or gas station, maybe .
8516 2018-11-21 16:48:49 YES, cuz LOWER OIL PRICES ARE SOOOOOO worth the brutal murder of one of our most brilliant journalists! Who cares about morality, decency, laws & basic humanity? Silly stuff compared to MONEY!! You go, Saudi Arabia, keep on murdering cuz this @POTUS will give you a free pass!!
8517 2018-11-21 16:48:42 Lets see how many barrels of oil or munition contracts are involved. No matter the victims nationality.
8518 2018-11-21 16:48:40 Pls, I wanna grow my beard like yours but I really need this beard oil...How can I get it?
8519 2018-11-21 16:48:39 The real question is how does ignoring MBS's crime have anything to do with price of oil?

There are too many factors that drive oil prices. This is little better than human sacrifice to make the weather gods happy.
8520 2018-11-21 16:48:35 Can I workshop this?

2003: Blood for OIl
2018: Blood and Soil
8521 2018-11-21 16:48:32 I’d rather have my oil stock share price back...
8522 2018-11-21 16:48:25 Why is oil down and Gas way up?

GOP swore id Obama won that gas would be too high. It’s up $1.50 since he left!

Who’s raping us?

8526 2018-11-21 16:48:15 And we are here still bickering whenever we hear oil prices are going down. It's a pity for my country.
8527 2018-11-21 16:48:13 Pour me water. The oil is too hot on my head 
8528 2018-11-21 16:48:12 I mean I'm already starting on a zone tan oil painting that's loads of sleaze
8529 2018-11-21 16:48:10 Money & politics over people's lives/deaths - that's Trump & his minions!!! As he endorses Saudi's brutality & butchers this country's environment for shale oil & coal, remember that Trump has had a chance to pursue clean energy & won't. No vision, no plan.

8531 2018-11-21 16:48:06 I am wary of people who pick a part a life-saving medication for their own personal gain. The mineral oil diatribe has been debunked over and over and was approved by the FTA. The only obvious answer is he is trying to spread doubt. Keep your blinders on I could care less
8532 2018-11-21 16:48:04 Doesn't he though??? Lord love a duck this is insane. (Also, he is talking s*** because he knows SA isn't making oil prices lower out of some thank-you gift.)
8533 2018-11-21 16:48:04 Do all the people that have nothing to do but complain realize that oil is a world market??? Sure, 11% of Suadi Arabia’s oil is imported into the United States but Saudi Arabia is the largest exporter of petroleum in the world!  Keep up the good work Mr Trump!
8534 2018-11-21 16:48:02 We keep thinking you can't go any lower. But blood for oil -- what's next?
8535 2018-11-21 16:47:59 #fake45 #liesAgain - lower per brl oil is #NOT a tax break. That price will change in weeks. 

However, the stock market dropping 1000 points in several days, wiping out all 2018 gains, definitely hurts #workingAmericans

BTW #fake45 did take credit for the drop..hmmm #whyIsThat
8536 2018-11-21 16:47:59 Stop drilling.
You've hit oil.
8537 2018-11-21 16:47:58 This is complete BS frm POTUS to his sycophant voters I guess who believe anything he says. But the majority of our population is not as dumb as Trump believes. OPEC decides this; not Trump & his buddies. There is a glut of oil in the market. That's the reason, not Trump. LIAR
8538 2018-11-21 16:47:57 Wait a minute. Doesn't lower oil prices make mining tar sands un profitable? Is Trump thanking Saudi Arabia for threatening American jobs in these oil fields ironically?
8539 2018-11-21 16:47:56 Here's hoping the next journalist murdered doesn't get in the way of any arms deals, or the price of oil, and thus causes further awkward moments for the president.
8540 2018-11-21 16:47:49 Trump - oil prices getting lower.  like a tax cut for usa - down from $82 to $54.  ty saudi
TRUTH:  $80 in 2014  $48 in june 2017 Now $54.  Gone UP over past 18 months.  We get oil from 89 countries, only 11% from Saudi.  Why thank them?  No values, no morals, no ethics, no life.
8541 2018-11-21 16:47:46 Oil
8542 2018-11-21 16:47:40 40% of imported oil to the US comes from Canada. 11% from KAS.
8543 2018-11-21 16:47:40 Pompeo announces sanctions on oil supplies to Syria with a  speech along the lines of, let nobody doubt the US regimes support for ISIS and all other radical islamists in Syria and the ME
8544 2018-11-21 16:47:40 If there is an after-life these guys at Zion Oil are not going to enjoy it
@zionoil $ZN
8545 2018-11-21 16:47:35 The only reason there hasn't been #oil crisis like in 1970s when Shah of Iran ruled OPEC against US & UK demands is Saudi Arabia. Otherwise all other major producers would love to sell less oil for tripple quadruple price. Saudis however try to act responsibily & follow US lead
8546 2018-11-21 16:47:33 1)Oil,is d grease that ensures movement of trade,not just for drivers.Think about trade itself-every commerce needs oil-ships,cranes,etc,right down to d bike of d pizza delivery boy.

If oil increases,EVERY commerce cost activity increases,not just by percentage,but exponentially
8547 2018-11-21 16:47:32 Do we have to sell our soul for lower gas prices? There are other countries that have oil...I truly pity people, whos' life revolves around money rather than people.
8548 2018-11-21 16:47:30 Biore cleansing oil? Gatau non-alkohol apa ngga tapi hehe
8549 2018-11-21 16:47:30 I appreciated their oil money investment prowess, so to speak. Now it's confusing.
8550 2018-11-21 16:47:29 Cheato & his sycophants have definitively taken the position that we mustn't cross Saudi Arabia or they might raise oil prices & back out of vague promises abt buying arms from us. How do Cult45 members not see this as incredibly weak? I realize they're delusional, but still...

8553 2018-11-21 16:47:22 we should not forget that we are producing lot of oil too.. lower oil prices means , lower profits for oil industry , layoffs in oil producing states.. will indirectly hit banks and economy.. remember what happened in 2016 when oil prices were very low..

8556 2018-11-21 16:47:11 Attention: trump will sell blood for oil, or money in his bank account. You have proven there is nothing too low for you. Resign.   #TreasonSummit
8557 2018-11-21 16:47:10 @ChenaOnuorah Sells beard oil too.  She can brighten up your beards 
8558 2018-11-21 16:47:10 @JeremyDeeSelden @realDonaldTrump If oil prices get too low, it hurts American workers in the oil industry.
8559 2018-11-21 16:47:10 Seed the pumpkin. Cut the skin off and cut into small squares. Put in a casserole dish add salt, pepper, olive oil, rosemary and sage. Bake at 350 for abt 45-60 mins, stir once or twice. Cook pasta then pour the cooked pumpkin onto the pasta. Add a little fresh olive oil.
8560 2018-11-21 16:47:08 Prices also plummeted to $31 under Obama in January 2016, if one wants to choose a different date.  It’s not about the price of crude oil. It’s about the lies. None of us should tolerate being lied to.
8561 2018-11-21 16:47:08 Pake coconut oil aja, bagus bgt kok ga kalah sm yg lain mah. Cari yg aman buat muka, lebih mantul drpd milk cleanser...
8562 2018-11-21 16:47:07 Getting my oil changed, I can finally race people at a red light again
8563 2018-11-21 16:46:59 Essential Oil believers are a fucking cult.
8564 2018-11-21 16:46:56 I saw this right after Pompeo’s press conf yesterday and his strange response to Khashoggi q. But SA has an abysmal human rights record under guise of counter-terrorism regs. US relations—primarily about oil?
8565 2018-11-21 16:46:55 Except the majority of our oil does NOT come from Saudi Arabia...
8566 2018-11-21 16:46:52 Yeah, but oil and weapons sales. Meh
8567 2018-11-21 16:46:51 1995 : OIL FOR FOOD - UN PROGRAM
2018 : OIL FOR BLOOD - MBS&TRUMP MACHINATION
#khashoogi
8568 2018-11-21 16:46:49 Because Trump is turning a blind eye to the genocide of children and people starving bigger than WW2, Holocaust that MBS has created with the weapons he bought from US,  in the war in Yemen with the Houthi. Yemen is Rich in oil. A Trump deal
8569 2018-11-21 16:46:46 Sorry.
I don't fall for bullsh!t snake oil.
8570 2018-11-21 16:46:44 So you let a murderer off the hook for oil.
8571 2018-11-21 16:46:43 As we speak his fat rolls are being massaged with oil in able to slide into his suit easier.
8572 2018-11-21 16:46:38 !!! I rarely laugh at American farmers but they believed this snake oil salesman so deal with it!
8573 2018-11-21 16:46:37 I'm not familiar with the oil and gas industries, though. Can you please tell me what happens in West Texas when the oil price goes down? Do wages drop or do entire plants go under?
8574 2018-11-21 16:46:35 Ughhhh!! I once had a similar thing happen driving from Chicago to Michigan. They didn’t replace the cap when they chanted the oil.
8575 2018-11-21 16:46:22 To think that some people still recently "invested" money in oil search in Africa  
8576 2018-11-21 16:46:22 I am and if we are to have any hope of our grandchildren seeing the next century we will need to cut back on greenhouse gas. Lean on pubic transportation more and tighten our belts. Buying oil from Saudis is just a band-aid on an arterial bleed.
8577 2018-11-21 16:46:13 Maintaining power is expensive 

Keeping MBS in power is going to cost Saudi Arabia billions in billions in lost oil revenue as they keep prices low to appease Trump
8578 2018-11-21 16:46:11 Well we there's really only a couple things US could do to actually hurt the suadi regime...stop buying their oil and we can all just pay $5 gal for gas or start a war with them...so which do you guys prefer??
8579 2018-11-21 16:46:09 ???? You comparing green energy to oil?
8580 2018-11-21 16:46:05 40% of USA imported oil comes from Canada and only 11% from Saudi Arabia. Thank your friends not brutal dictatorships
8581 2018-11-21 16:45:59 SA sends us way less oil than Canada does. Actually read something for a change...if you can read that is.
8582 2018-11-21 16:45:56 Cheaper oil for killing a US resident and known journalist who wrote against the Saudi Government. Yeah I'm sorry, I thought we didn't like terrorism? Why are we buying their oil and dealing with them? #Resistance #Khashoggi
8583 2018-11-21 16:45:55 That’s great Mr.Trump, now go call the murdered journalist’s fiancé, family & friends and tell them it’s all ok because there dead relative’s life was worth the $28 a barrel we’re saving in oil!
8584 2018-11-21 16:45:54 You should trying buying CBD oil no thc no “high” but all the benefits, do a little research but if you want a recommendation let me know! Just started taking a few drops before bed and been sleeping so good!
8585 2018-11-21 16:45:52 Also, according to Google, the largest sources of U.S. imported oil are: Canada (40%), Saudi Arabia (11%), Venezuela (9%), Mexico (8%), & Colombia (4%). According to the American Petroleum Institute, the oil & natural gas industry supports nine million U.S. jobs.
8586 2018-11-21 16:45:46 Coconut oil, castor oil, carrot oil, tea tree oil, jajoba oil, vitamin E oil..
8587 2018-11-21 16:45:44 Hey Twittertwat, we get most of our oil from CANADA!!!
8588 2018-11-21 16:45:41 Pissed af because I just washed my FR hoodie and got it covered in oil today 
8589 2018-11-21 16:45:40 Every body wants lower oil prices but what they don’t understand we here in Louisiana depend on the oilfield for our jobs, trump administration kills oilfield will not support the trump agenda any more
8590 2018-11-21 16:45:39 How about the 8 waivers @realDonaldTrump ‘s @WhiteHouse gave to other countries to purchase oil from Iran to keep prices down.
8591 2018-11-21 16:45:37 Not too low. Oil and Gas states need to keep working.
8592 2018-11-21 16:45:36 Finally got my oil changed... I was only a couple thousand over nbd lol

Matt; hint: drop mineral oil write movie script, get rich
8594 2018-11-21 16:45:35 Parfum my boy.. Oil base only no water base 
8595 2018-11-21 16:45:34 How about thanking Canada? We supply more oil to the US that the Saudis.
8596 2018-11-21 16:45:29 You're not oil Jesus, you cannot turn water into oil, or sand grains into dollar bills, so probably not..
8597 2018-11-21 16:45:27 He is clueless.  Oil prices falling is a bad sign for global economics.   Recession time is looming.
8598 2018-11-21 16:45:26 Oil is falling because of economic uncertainty and possible beginning of a recession.
8599 2018-11-21 16:45:16 American oil is fairly expensive to make, so lower oil prices will put a lot of american oil workers out of business. We need to switch to renewables
8600 2018-11-21 16:45:15 The US imports about 11% of its oil from Saudi Arabia. It gets 40% from Canada. And the Saudis don't determine the price of oil. One day the American people WILL know your self-serving motives in ignoring the horrific murder of Jamal Khashoggi and you kissing SA's ass. #Corrupt
8601 2018-11-21 16:45:14 A journalist's life is worth taking if we can have low oil prices??  What the holy fuck?  What a demented mind he has.  @realDonaldTrump is basically now an #AccompliceToMurder.
8602 2018-11-21 16:45:05 1. Wake up in am
2. Brush teeth
3. Wash face
4. Moisturize
5. Apply eye cream
6. Combine tea tree oil and coconut oil 
(You can use a different carrier oil if you don't like coconut oil)
7. Apply on any breakouts
8603 2018-11-21 16:45:04 Of course he lies. That's what he does every day. But with the accelerating climate disaster, maybe volume of oil exports, particularly dirty tar sands oil, is not a bragging point?
8604 2018-11-21 16:44:57 No one can beat Modi guvt in way They handled fiscal deficit despite bank NPAs.
Yes cheap oil helped but so what ?
Next guvt if UPA will reap benefit of NPA fix and GST and inflate economy. Good for all vested interests .
8605 2018-11-21 16:44:55 This is NOT the 70’s. Saudi Arabia is NOT the sole reason for the drop in oil.
8606 2018-11-21 16:44:54 Thanks @NickyAACampbell until I hear a statement from @CadburyUK I am #boycottingcadburys for using #palm oil
8607 2018-11-21 16:44:51 If you sell snake oil make sure you always incorporate religion
8608 2018-11-21 16:44:51 What will @realdonaldtrump say when after #SaudiArabia cuts oil production and prices go back up? Our “leader” is an idiot.
8609 2018-11-21 16:44:50 You can use my argan oil shampoo, even my Shea manuka wash, but I’ll wild out if you using my face shit dawg.
8610 2018-11-21 16:44:50 HALA HUY abi nako si kuya tantan samokaaa uy HAHAHAHAHA sorryyy pows thank you kuya mau!!!  samoka sa imong name uy mura mag change oil
8611 2018-11-21 16:44:35 Ed I think you are wrong about his doing this for oil prices. He has been in debt to them for years, and stands to profit from arm sales which they will use to kill civillians in Yeman.
8612 2018-11-21 16:44:32 No relationship exists between gas prices and Trump's willingness to condemn the Saudis. Oil is a commodity that rises and falls on supply and demand. Unless we're contemplating a global oil embargo of the Saudis (and no one is), strong words shouldn't affect gas prices.
8613 2018-11-21 16:44:31 If only I had the time to photoshop PrincessDianaOhMate.jpeg into an oil painting
8614 2018-11-21 16:44:30 Goodmorning everyone except everyone at Zion oil and gas.
8615 2018-11-21 16:44:28 Methinks the bigger question is whether #Saudis are going to sell oil to #China for CNY
8616 2018-11-21 16:44:27 Journalists getting murdered and dismembered - no big deal. But, hey, look at those oil prices. You are despicable and it's clear you value money more than human lives.
8617 2018-11-21 16:44:27 To be HONEST, USA produces more oil and gets more oil from Texas than Saudi Arabia
... Arms deals are another issue, tho.
8618 2018-11-21 16:44:22 Any1 who drops a fully frozen + wet bird into a 350degree overfilled vat of oil deserves to have their house burn down.
8619 2018-11-21 16:44:21 We have been preaching diversification! But do you know that if Nigeria is restructured, diversification is a must and we will have a many streams of revenue beside oil?
8620 2018-11-21 16:44:20 Now it’s time for you to get back on the horse in oil country mooger
8621 2018-11-21 16:44:19 Do you have enough oil money on you to get Donnie to kiss up to you?
8622 2018-11-21 16:44:18 I'm not negative about the oilers. The oilers are negative with me.
8623 2018-11-21 16:44:16 How about we take the IPCC report, as conservative as they are, seriously and reduce the demand for oil? That would be a double win.
8624 2018-11-21 16:44:14 We have never had a more blatant example of trading blood for oil.
8625 2018-11-21 16:44:13 55555 ลูกต้องมองเห็นพี่ จากประกายกลิตเตอร์ตอนพี่พู่กระพริบตาใช่มั้ยคะ

8627 2018-11-21 16:43:59 Jesus F. Christ! The immorality of this is the prime trump crime.....

But, this dickhead piles on a lie. The high was $75, not $82.

Now, oil biz reality is that producers want to raise prices by cutting production. trump is blackmailing Saudi to not with a dead reporter! Jesus!
8628 2018-11-21 16:43:56 tanginang tong maybelline legit di matanggal nag pancit canton nako tibay padin!!!! petroleum at oil na pahirapan padi
8629 2018-11-21 16:43:55 So, how does it feel to pay for oil with the price of a man's life?  Asking for a friend.  #KhashoggiMurder #UnfitToBePresident
8630 2018-11-21 16:43:53 Thank you Saudi Arabia???? Maybe lives are more important to the rest of us than oil prices and tax cuts. They need to be accountable
8631 2018-11-21 16:43:52 U.S. is a net oil producer.   The drop in prices hurts U.S. more than it helps.      And hello!  The Dow is crashing, time to borrow another trillion or so- put it on our grandchildren's tab just like last year.
8632 2018-11-21 16:43:50 Plenty of oil on those glutes
8633 2018-11-21 16:43:47 And we get about 40% of our oil from Canada, only about 11% from Saudi Arabia, anyways!
8634 2018-11-21 16:43:46 I am curious what you are thanking Trump for.  He's thanking Saudis for a recent drop in prices which had far more to do with US oil production than SA.  Plus, the Saudi's floated a plan on Nov. 11 to cut production and boost prices. Also, oil has not been $82/barrel...
8635 2018-11-21 16:43:39 The logic of this president baffled me, he blamed California for mismanaging federal property and defended the Saudis because he needed their oil that caused the change in climate which is causing California to burn and Texas to flood. Am I the only ones that see it this way?
8636 2018-11-21 16:43:34 The logic of this president baffled me, he blamed California for mismanaging federal property and defended the Saudis because he needed their oil that caused the change in climate which is causing California to burn and Texas to flood.

8637 2018-11-21 16:43:33 Try olive oil, thank me later
8638 2018-11-21 16:43:33 SA does not single handedly control the oil market.The market is based on supply/demand.

Falling oil prices typically are a sign of an economic slowdown that could lead into recession.  The latter would be historically correct given that recessions often occur during a Rep pres.
8639 2018-11-21 16:43:32 Our stainless steel #nameplates are durable enough to withstand the harsh environments of the oil and gas industry.
8640 2018-11-21 16:43:31 Plan on basis of $30 oil.Excess goes into SWF. Spend only what you earn, no borrowing except for critical projects that can demonstrate real cash flow to repay (4get social income).Stop all d political jamborees,do smart public service, innovate and stop paying for ALL indolence.
8641 2018-11-21 16:43:30 But they can kill us with no repocussions from our government. Just so long as we get our fix. That's fucking scary. Apparantly our president will trade me for oil. I'm fucking terrified.
8642 2018-11-21 16:43:30 The logic of this president baffled me, he blamed California for mismanaging federal property and defended the Saudis because he needed their oil that caused the change in climate which is causing California to burn and Texas to flood.

8644 2018-11-21 16:43:25 I’d love to have a President that doesn’t condone and welcome the killing of American citizens for money and oil.

8646 2018-11-21 16:43:24 That's what Big oil brings to the table! We have no backbone to it's corruption.
8647 2018-11-21 16:43:24 i need to get up and go get my oil changed
8648 2018-11-21 16:43:22 I'm beginning to think there is literally nobody at the Globe that cares in the slightest bit about Canada.

We buy all Saudi oil. A lot of it. Despite having a massive supply of our own oil. And you know this. 

You people make me sick.
8649 2018-11-21 16:43:21 Your Russian friends are not going to be happy about the lower oil prices which will hit their already bad economy...
8650 2018-11-21 16:43:16 I use Cantu leave-in conditioner and sometimes the curl activator. But i use Aussie shampoo and conditioner

Am I the only ones that see it this way?
8652 2018-11-21 16:43:13 It's funny, we're NOT seeing lower prices at the pump. Also, we get 40% of our oil from Canada & only 9% from Saudia Arabia. 
So why do you hate on Canada & kiss Saudia's ass?????
8653 2018-11-21 16:43:13 Trump blows Saudi Arabia for oil
8654 2018-11-21 16:43:09 The logic of this president baffled me, he blamed California for mismanaging federal property and defended the Saudis because he needed their oil that caused the change in climate which is causing California to burn and Texas to flood. Am I the only ones that see it this way?
8655 2018-11-21 16:43:09 @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump @BarackObama @ObamaFoundation @Trump - Trump and Obama families the two governments are making a gross and discase view of the genocide of more than 85000 children in Yemen-starving. Why is that? Saudi oil is worth life?
8656 2018-11-21 16:43:06 I’m absolutely with you! If our industry is going to frack our lands and not move to green energy, then let’s use our own oil and not Saudi oil! But I think what we’re going to find is the Saudis have bank rolled Trump. This is his pay back the same as with Russia!
8657 2018-11-21 16:43:04 You are like a selfish greedy dog, you would never give anything to anyone. You people got Trillion dollars oil and minerals from Iraq and Afghanistan in a self inflicted war and we lost thousands of common innocent and most valuable peoples.
8658 2018-11-21 16:43:04 Exactly obuma the great divider n hate seed farmer. Brainwashed with his magic as a snake oil salesman.

Am I the only ones that see it this way?
8660 2018-11-21 16:42:55 Mr President.  $85 is a reasonable price. Don’t forget oil and gas is a huge part of the economy and thousands of Americans are employed in this industry. They will suffer as the result of prices too low
8661 2018-11-21 16:42:54 tRump tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to 'a big Tax Cut for America and the World!' In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia. This monkey has to go
8662 2018-11-21 16:42:49 When said palm oil is dumped from ships and washes up on the beach and our pet dogs eat it the result is the same.  It kills them.  It needs to be banned.
8663 2018-11-21 16:42:48 My favourite part of Iceland's palm oil mission is all the vegans clapping back about them still supporting other animal products 
8664 2018-11-21 16:42:46 Need to buy this oil pan for my car lol , never driving my car drunk again . Results are i end the night with a crack oil pan
8665 2018-11-21 16:42:45 Get into politics so that when your ideas find oil and gas, Our input will turn Nigeria into the edifice of our dream.

8669 2018-11-21 16:42:38 CBC, we enjoy your productions! Thanks for the update! There is a glut of oil on the market now. Trump has no idea about that! Yes,  thank you, Canada! I live in Ohio...
8670 2018-11-21 16:42:38 Thanks to Saudi Arabia now ? how dare you ? isnt the same country that producing terrorists all around the world ? so just because they supplying you with Oil and everything is just fine !!!! well shame on you @realDonaldTrump
8671 2018-11-21 16:42:37 I was not the only one that decided an oil change was a good idea today
8672 2018-11-21 16:42:34 But what Saudi Arabia does affects the oil price more because they are the swing producer.
8673 2018-11-21 16:42:34 @realDonaldTrump 
Price of oil at the end of 2016 was under $54.
The price of oil fluctuates with supply and demand (& perceived crisis).
Is the world economy slowing down?
8674 2018-11-21 16:42:32 Our leaders just sit back and wait for oil money to come! They are lazy! No innovation! It is time to restructure Nigeria
8675 2018-11-21 16:42:29 The logic of this president baffled me, he blamed California for mismanaging federal property and defended the Saudis because he needed their oil that caused the change in climate which is causing California to burn and Texas to flood. Am I the only ones that see it this way?
8676 2018-11-21 16:42:25 This also lowers American profits on oil production but that's not as good of a talking point..
8677 2018-11-21 16:42:24 Katy Perry what are you feeling up that turkey with motor oil
8678 2018-11-21 16:42:22 هذا رجال ولا مره
8679 2018-11-21 16:42:21 Takes a lot of oil & gas to power those windmills and make them spin so maybe learn Chief
8680 2018-11-21 16:42:13 KSA should increase oil rates and make itself stronger.
If US sell it weapons at no subsidized rate to KSA, then why should KSA do it?
8681 2018-11-21 16:42:11 Oh! Look the snake oil salesman is at it again. Promoting a book he never read.
8682 2018-11-21 16:42:09 The logic of this president baffled me, he blamed California for mismanaging federal property and defended the Saudis because he needed their oil that caused the change in climate which is causing California to burn and Texas to flood. Am I the only ones that see it this way?
8683 2018-11-21 16:42:08 Shame on you. You have sold out American honor and decency for Saudi gold and Saudi oil. This of course is just your first payoff for overlooking Mr. Kashoggi's murder. You have blood on your hands. It will be hard to wash off.
8684 2018-11-21 16:42:05 Canada supplies 40% of US oil.  Saudi Arabia....11%
8685 2018-11-21 16:42:02 i just put hella CBD oil in my cold brew & it’s got me feelin some type of way
8686 2018-11-21 16:42:01 Obviously you’ve never got your fat a$$ out of a limo to pump gas so you have no idea how gas prices work. Cost of oil goes down gas price stays UP. Cost of oil goes UP gas price immediately spikes UP. #InconvenientTruth #Clueless Its like workers getting #GOPTaxScam refund NEVER
8687 2018-11-21 16:41:59 That's not. A tax cut for America,all Americans don't drive. And true Americans don't sacrifice American life for oil.
8688 2018-11-21 16:41:58 The logic of this president baffled me, he blamed California for mismanaging federal property and defended the Saudis because he needed their oil that caused the change in climate which is causing California to burn and Texas to flood. Am I the only ones that see it this way?
8689 2018-11-21 16:41:57 And Oil 
8690 2018-11-21 16:41:55 You have know idea of what you speak.  Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.  Your love of Money will bring you down.  You will get what you deserve.  Hold on, Ghosts are a coming.  #resign #putinspuppet #mbspuppet
8691 2018-11-21 16:41:54 also does he get how that's bad for like America (or at least it's frackers and shale oil producers?)
8692 2018-11-21 16:41:53 Being completely honest, SA is bad. The rest of the Middle East is worse. Until you all start going completely oil free in your daily lives, we have to in some level put up with these A-holes. Nature of the beast.
8693 2018-11-21 16:41:51 Saudi controls the oil prices! They always have. That’s what he is thanking. Context !!
8694 2018-11-21 16:41:48 #oott #the #kill #zone #we #sell #oil #now #brent #wti #energy
8695 2018-11-21 16:41:47 Enjoy. Both $CRC and $WLL are highly volatile. Any spike in crude oil  will give ~ $2 .
8696 2018-11-21 16:41:40 Doesn’t Canada provide 40% of the oil ?
8697 2018-11-21 16:41:37 Dear Mr. President lower oil prices hurts workers here in Louisiana and keeps our pay down, I voted for u because we need oil prices up not down, u will loose a lot of Louisiana votes in 2020, just like Obama killing the oil field you are following please find destroy La.
8698 2018-11-21 16:41:34 So lower oil prices makes murder ok ?
8699 2018-11-21 16:41:32 There is blood in that oil.  But whatever!
8700 2018-11-21 16:41:31 Not ll and there are many that don;t need primary food crop land. There's also algae oil which is far more productive than crop based.
8701 2018-11-21 16:41:30 Why are we worried about the price of foreign oil - we are EXPORTING oil again. We have plenty to cover our own needs thanks to fracking. We should just get out of the middle east and let the Moslems fight it out between the Sunni and Shite factions!
8702 2018-11-21 16:41:23 @MongooseTrader no worries, oil will hit 49 very soon.
8703 2018-11-21 16:41:16 Supply and demand
if the oil coming out of the Arabian gulf decreases for any reason immediately the oil prices will increase, the Arabian gulf countries control 20-25% of the oil supply to the world
8704 2018-11-21 16:41:12 We've all known how important Saudi oil is to us, but now we REALLY KNOW how important it is
8705 2018-11-21 16:41:10 Also, seasoning is stuffed between the skin and the meat, i made a paste of salt, pepper, herbs and a garlic infused olive oil and rubbed it all over the turkey under the skin.

Clearly, i dont fuck around
8706 2018-11-21 16:41:09 I'm old enough to remember when everyone could enjoy lower oil prices which is directly related to the price you pay for gas. 
It's really not a BAD thing. In fact could be framed as a positive.
8707 2018-11-21 16:41:02 Iran still selling oil not in normal markets but dont be stupid they are making money on their oil.
8708 2018-11-21 16:40:59 It is possible to keep oil prices low without sweeping murder under the rug. If only @realDonaldTrump was a good negotiator. #maga
8709 2018-11-21 16:40:56 Are you kidding! Is this supposed to replace the Middle Class Tax Cut you promised was coming before mid-terms? I’d rather pay more for Oil then make a deal with the Devil! You’ve sold your soul!
8710 2018-11-21 16:40:54 Youre so right Comrade!  Time to nationalize oil, airlines, amazon, apple, grocery stores, car companies and make all those capitlists pay their workers a $25 living wage!! Isn't that right Socialist Barbie?
8711 2018-11-21 16:40:53 @WtfAmerica4 Trump hate democrazia hate hummanity hate death loves thrilions dollars cheap oil and Will dead leavs mony andare broken honor
8712 2018-11-21 16:40:49 WTI Oil pops $1 in 10min
8713 2018-11-21 16:40:48 PSA: the implementation of tea tree oil and lavender oil in my skin care regime has cleared my acne issues by about 95% so...yeah there’s an idea
8714 2018-11-21 16:40:44 Trump should thank Canada...40% of imported oil comes from Canada, only 11% of foreign oil comes from Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, Canadian oil is sold below Saudi Arabia's oil price. You are welcome.
8715 2018-11-21 16:40:40 Keeping track of everyone’s allergies is really getting to me. I almost freaked out bc I added coconut oil, and Manveena is allergic to coconut. Manveena is in California and will not be in attendance for Thanksgiving.
8716 2018-11-21 16:40:40 well if they use palm oil from Borneo or Sumatra then the answer is obviously yes
8717 2018-11-21 16:40:37 I may not be your personal friend but I live in Ontario and stand up for Alberta resources every single day. Its absolute atrocity how we take your profits and buy Saudi oil with it. Just shameful and disgusting. Canadians need to start banging down politicians doors.
8718 2018-11-21 16:40:33 É o famoso repique. 

Pessoal da Casa Branca tinha que brincar de Vaca Amarela, ou cortar o acesso a redes sociais do Trump. 

Saudades oil lá em cima, Petro bombando, calls dando gain. 

hahahaha
8719 2018-11-21 16:40:33 Houston hurts when oil prices are this low...
8720 2018-11-21 16:40:31 Punyalah nak double cleansing every night taknak tinggal sampai balik rumah tido semalaman pun bawak cleansing oil. Sekali aku lupa nak bawak balik eiiiii. Hanya sebab taknak tinggal sehari, terpaksa tinggal berhari2 
8721 2018-11-21 16:40:30 Your limited understanding of the economy is troubling. Gas prices/energy prices will not fall with oil prices. Please stop attempting to auction off American global leadership to despotic regimes and Trump Organization financiers.
8722 2018-11-21 16:40:30 Summary of your life:
Worst prime minister i modern Swedish history
Taking blood money from oil company
Failed negotiator in Yugoslavia
8723 2018-11-21 16:40:28 Thank us when we stop buying theid oil, selling them weapons and we finally act on freeing Rauf Badawi.
8724 2018-11-21 16:40:22 That's silly. There's an oil glut and it comes from a variety of factors most notably a LACK of demand globally. Since you and your GOP kind love fracking, lower oil prices puts frackers out of business. Winning.
8725 2018-11-21 16:40:19 Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia. Who cares about the chopped reporter?
8726 2018-11-21 16:40:16 He needs to follow @Archaeologuy . Much more positive.....
8727 2018-11-21 16:40:16 Nice try illigegtimate, popular vote losing, liar. Oil prices have nothing to do with you supporting a murderer and Saudi Arabia. The shiny object deflection BS isn't going to work anymore.
8728 2018-11-21 16:40:15 ホンマにそれです。自分のラインの問題だと思います

8730 2018-11-21 16:40:10 Our oil ?? We sell it at a discount to the states then eastern Canada buys it back for price. Is that good business
8731 2018-11-21 16:40:06 Buying America's complacency with low oil prices.
8732 2018-11-21 16:40:05 ぼくに言わせればワセリンすら食用だよ。
8733 2018-11-21 16:40:05 Btw, you’re lying, even about the gas prices. We know our gas prices and gas/oil itself have little or nothing to do with KSA, you sick #dirtbag.
8734 2018-11-21 16:40:03 That's really not how the oil market works
8735 2018-11-21 16:40:01 We can get oil elsewhere. I think we get most of it elsewhere as it is. Saudi Arabia is also backing the war in Yemen which is responsible for many thousands of deaths. I know USA has blood on its hands, but we don't need to make it worse by dealing with Saudis any longer.
8736 2018-11-21 16:40:00 Isn’t it funny how “America first” only applies to the economic stability and keeping oil prices down but not to actual American lives? If he had died in Jamaican or any other country. The U.S would have waged war even before the confirmation of his death.
8737 2018-11-21 16:39:56 Sama wey, sensitif sekali bagian anu, jadi kudu pake yg longgar banget, coba pake bio oil? Tapi diolesinnya sambil di pijetinnnn terus sampe bener2 kering, biar meresap sampai ke pori2
8738 2018-11-21 16:39:54 Breaded in Panko and fried in olive oil. Long Island Sound and Block Island Sound was full of them this year. Family consensus was that these are tastier than flounder, striper or tataug. Enjoy!
8739 2018-11-21 16:39:48 My mom: what do you want for Christmas??  Momma get me an oil change or pay a bill I beg of you
8740 2018-11-21 16:39:45 Cooking oil, yhi Fishoyli
8741 2018-11-21 16:39:45 Cunts are all getting beard trimmers, oil, brushes and shit for Christmas and here's me at 32 no got a sidey to ma name 
8742 2018-11-21 16:39:45 I'll be on CNBC talking markets in the 2pm EST hour today, (12/21) back on MSNBC in the 3pm hour talking oil and again on MSNBC at 11pm tonight. Please tune in!
8743 2018-11-21 16:39:39 Not to mention we lose jobs. Like the last time oil dropped
8744 2018-11-21 16:39:32 A factor that brought Oil down was U.S. production in ND to TX are quick to get online when prices hit $80. The industry has been booming. When prices drop back down, those regions start contracting. 
Look for weaker OIL investment, 
Maybe can offset by growth in POT Investment

8746 2018-11-21 16:39:28 Did u catch Traitor Trump & Marie Antoinette in the WH Garden announcing a pardon 4 the Saudi prince?  And thanking him 4 oil prices dropping?  As long as the price of polluting oil drops, destroying our planet, he can murder any reporter he chooses.  That's Trump's fantasy too.
8747 2018-11-21 16:39:24 And once again, you prove that Zionist Israel can indeed buy a puppet (yourself) anyone not blind  knows the ousted Saudi Regime (who paid for your campaign) was a puppet of the Israeli state waging an illegal war to steal oil in Yemen. Now today Yemeni peace talks are announced.
8748 2018-11-21 16:39:24 Checking everything to make sure it doesn’t contain palm oil and practically everything I like does 
8749 2018-11-21 16:39:24 Yes we'll do F-all about it because all those Gulf states have us over a barrel. A barrel of oil. Money cancels out any morality we may pretend to promote in the world.
8750 2018-11-21 16:39:23 I suspect that the Democrats and fake news media will be shouting about the evils of cheaper oil causing more pollution.  Or, how they can now increase the taxes on gasoline and diesel fuels.  Glad that you have veto power on any stupid new laws that the Dems want to pass.
8751 2018-11-21 16:39:20 After two public warnings from the don to congress re Saudi relationship I’m guessing we will see a split in US Saudi relations via congress leaving Donny an avenue to blame congress for soaring oil prices before 2020 election.
8752 2018-11-21 16:39:20 Plus it's a lie. (Another lie.) Oil hasn't been at $82 since about 4 yrs ago. Granted, it was around $76 in Oct., about $55 today & could go lower. But, like the stock mkt, he'll take credit until it reverses. Then ... nothing.
8753 2018-11-21 16:39:15 "It appears the oil has put out the fire." 
8754 2018-11-21 16:39:14 So you wage a war in which 85, 000 children die of starvation.  You execute a maid who killed her employer/racist.  You murder a journalist in your own consulate.  You sentence a U.K. student to life  for ‘spying’ - and as long as you have oil and buy our weapons, NOTHING HAPPENS
8755 2018-11-21 16:39:12 I like essential oils as the fragrance component of bath and body care products. I think tea tree oil is great at drying up pimples. But that doesn’t make them a good substitute for tested and researched medicines.
8756 2018-11-21 16:39:11 "Thank you to Saudi Arabia"...?
ROTFLMAO
#oil #joke #mademyday
8757 2018-11-21 16:39:09 Your sense of history is skewed. The US has been bound to the Saudis since 1938 with the discovery of oil. Both parties are equally to blame for the relationship between our countries .
8758 2018-11-21 16:39:00 Bio oil lambat. Guna dermatix. Dermatix kat guardian/watson mahal. So cari kat farmasi murah kit. Boleh letak kat parut muka gak
8759 2018-11-21 16:38:56 i hate using a girl’s shower. like do i use this repair argan oil shampoo and if so what am i repairing? or do i use this brass off stuff and why would anyone have brass in their hair? where is the 3 in 1????
8760 2018-11-21 16:38:54 A con artist, especially would be much worse than a snake oil salesman !!!
8761 2018-11-21 16:38:52 We don't need their oil
8762 2018-11-21 16:38:52 @CBCNews share the responsibility and tweet about the large oil cooperation doing damages to our environment. We already know consumer use plastic
8763 2018-11-21 16:38:46 Plus... that slap was for the ancestors. Prolly smelled like a back row hymnal from Shug Avery’s Daddy'church, anointed with oil, and cover by the blood. 

That fade BEEN on layaway and somebody just got paid.
8764 2018-11-21 16:38:46 He just hates the fact he doesn't have total control.
Trying to manipulate the oil price and the share price of hundreds of stocks.
8765 2018-11-21 16:38:43 Mom: You need to get your oil change. Make an apt. 
Me: yeah yeah I’ll do it *2weeks later*
Mom: Did you get it done 
Me:no I forgot
Me: *about to leave* my car signals me I need to get my oil change. . Por pendeja
8766 2018-11-21 16:38:42 You also get more oil from us in Canada than you do the Saudis.
8767 2018-11-21 16:38:41 Sodium usually packed in oil to prevent contact with water in air. Story of kid who snuck sodium out of chem lab by hiding it in shirt. Sweat reacted with sodium, made lye. On skin. Kid had horrible caustic lye burns on chest. (Put on "do not ever do this" list.)
8768 2018-11-21 16:38:39 You are disgusting!!!! Under President Obama, we weren't getting that much oil from Saudi Arabia. You make Nixon look like a saint!
8769 2018-11-21 16:38:38 @realDonaldTrump Oil prices may be lower. But being in bed with opec and Saudia Arabia isn't worth the price. Your intelligence people told you bin Salman ORDERED the death. Quit lieing about well maybe he knew. They the (CIA) have far more intelligence and experience than you.
8770 2018-11-21 16:38:36 OIL PRICES EXTEND GAINS, WTI RISES MORE THAN $2 TO SESSION HIGH OF $55.53 A BARREL
#OOTT
8771 2018-11-21 16:38:35 Ohh man Trump’s in a constant state of loco since the midterms -  wtf  more dead journalists for lower crude oil !  party up America
8772 2018-11-21 16:38:34 I get that you guys dont like Trump but dont you think?? 

You realize you are looking to raise oil prices, destabilize the middle east more and Iran Syria and Russia will be the ones to gain.  

This is fake outrage
8773 2018-11-21 16:38:34 Canada’s largest refinery, the Irving Oil New Brunswick facility, imports oil from Saudi Arabia...
8774 2018-11-21 16:38:34 Thanks for the reminder that you have ZERO understanding of how the price of oil is determined or who we import oil from. 
8775 2018-11-21 16:38:33 STUPID man baby we get 40%  of our oil from Canada and only 9% from the Saudi ......Saudi prince has you by the . Because he bailed you out of bankruptcy.....we are fed up ...with your 
8776 2018-11-21 16:38:32 Do you know if Canadian oil imports are exempt from tariffs?
8777 2018-11-21 16:38:30 I’ve needed an oil change for months, and today my brother called me and told me to go over and he’ll handle it all. Buying everything, doing the whole thing, all if it. 
8778 2018-11-21 16:38:28 You know a fantastic quality-of-life-improver that people don't make enough at home?

Popcorn.

Cheap, easy, 3 minutes to make on a hot hob & those fluffy kernels with salt & butter (& a drop of truffle oil if you're feeling fancy) amplify televisual enjoyment at least 345.7%.
8779 2018-11-21 16:38:22 Hey now, nobody knows more about the oil market than Donald Trump.
8780 2018-11-21 16:38:21 Sales were approaching ~$230m annually before Reduce-It in a genericized rx fish oil market.

Lovaza did $1B without CVOT & with similar 'horse sized' pills.

Never heard of any such issue from $AMRN.

Any ball park guesstimate on peak sales?
8781 2018-11-21 16:38:21 OIL SUPER SQUEEZE I $CEI you
8782 2018-11-21 16:38:19 How dopey was that. And the gas prices are going up in my area.  Even I know Canada supplies more oil to us!
8783 2018-11-21 16:38:18 Even if you don’t believe in man made climate change, why does everyone still want to bow to the Saudis and other parts if the middle east for oil? We need to innovate and cut that line for good. Seems like a win/win to me.
8784 2018-11-21 16:38:15 Not having an Oil War over Khashoggi - if this guy worked at The Washington Times nobody would be fighting for him.
8785 2018-11-21 16:38:13 2/ Humans are remarkably resilient - if faced w/starvation for lack of something, they'll adjust, even if that is lack of USDs.  Key EM's have been making adjustments for yrs now - watch phys gold flows.  Creditors/oil exporters can use phys gold to end any USD shortage overnight
8786 2018-11-21 16:38:13 #ThanksgivingEve As stocks plunge, healthcare premiums skyrocket, the deficit soars and the national debt hits new records,  is trying to distract from all his disasters by thanking the murderers in Saudi Arabia for lower oil prices?

What a pathetic failure he is. #Loser
8787 2018-11-21 16:38:10 @CBCNews TWEET ABOUT THE OIL SPILLS BRUH! STOP THIS CONSUMER BLAME
8788 2018-11-21 16:38:07 Oil.
8789 2018-11-21 16:38:07 Oil up 4%. Saudi Arabia 1. Trump 0. This will be interesting to watch.
8790 2018-11-21 16:38:05 전독시도 아포칼립스물로 참 좋은디...
8791 2018-11-21 16:38:04 [RTRS] (LCOc1 CLc1) - OIL PRICES EXTEND GAINS, WTI RISES MORE THAN $2 TO SESSION HIGH OF $55.53 A BARREL
8792 2018-11-21 16:38:02 Maybe @CNN will step up &  offer too get oil prices even lower? Just thinking out loud again.
8793 2018-11-21 16:38:01 Trump should thank Canada...40% of imported oil comes from Canada, only 11% of foreign oil comes from Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, Canadian oil is sold below Saudi Arabia oil price. You are welcome.
8794 2018-11-21 16:37:58 It's worth remembering that we get 40% of our oil from CANADA, and ONLY 9% from the Saudis. 
Yet trump keeps bashing Canada. 
He's really a fucking moron.
8795 2018-11-21 16:37:57 if you like me have already OD'd on holiday sweets just get you some Peppermint vitality oil put a drop in your water and presto! You now feel good enough to eat more!
8796 2018-11-21 16:37:53 COW　Crude Oil Washing 原油洗浄
8797 2018-11-21 16:37:47 Shale companies are a variation on that theme. Produce as much oil and gas as possible to the win the "I produced the most" award. Don't bother w/ demand or product prices. Over-produce, lose money, don't adjust, ask for more money & get it. Perfect business model.
8798 2018-11-21 16:37:41 @Gop suddenly rebukes murder of @washingtonpost  Khashoggi. But continue supporting the Wh resident's hatred,  "@LindseyGrahamSC." We're now a nation that supports murder for lower gas prices? Disgusting state of affairs to kiss Saudis ass for oil we don't need #corruption
8799 2018-11-21 16:37:40 American journalists get murdered? 
tRumps actions as long as oil prices drop? 
Continuing coal and fossil fuels being important.
Polluting the earth and disregarding the health of people, the safety of journalists, and protecting the lives of those who seek safety in the US.
8800 2018-11-21 16:37:39 I would rather have them promote kumquat oil as an alternative to petroleum than raise taxes!
8801 2018-11-21 16:37:39 You cut up tires and sauté them in baby oil with yo nasty ass 
8802 2018-11-21 16:37:39 '' We're leading the way in securing 100% sustainable supply.'' in other words no we don't give 2 fucks if we need palm oil that's not from sustainable supply well get it regardless of how many animals suffer.
8803 2018-11-21 16:37:32 You know countries other than Saudi produce oil right?
8804 2018-11-21 16:37:28 The percent of oil we get from Saudi Arabia is lower than Trump's approval rating.
8805 2018-11-21 16:37:26 適当に４度いて
8806 2018-11-21 16:37:25 Had it been Donald Chumps mother or any other family member who were dismembered, it would be okay because he oil is at 54 U.S. pesos.
8807 2018-11-21 16:37:23 Low oil prices are nice for consumers, but not necessarily great for the economy and domestic jobs.
8808 2018-11-21 16:37:20 oil 55 limit orders
8809 2018-11-21 16:37:20 OIL PRICES EXTEND GAINS, WTI RISES MORE THAN $2 TO SESSION HIGH OF $55.53 A BARREL

8810 2018-11-21 16:37:19 This man is so arrogant and obnoxious.  Snake oil salesman.
8811 2018-11-21 16:37:18 The graph doesn't say how much oil we get from Canada, only the percentage of oil we get.
8812 2018-11-21 16:37:16 Are you personally taking credit for oil prices? And you are asking the whole world to be grateful to you? OMG.  Unbelievable.
8813 2018-11-21 16:37:15 @washingtonpost Trump is saying Oil is going down . No wonder , We paying with blood if it comes to gasoline. Saudis are killers and our President is supporting them .
8814 2018-11-21 16:37:15 Isn't this, to an extent counterproductive for the US shale oil industry as a low price environment will deter investment? 
Saudi has also announced production cuts. Do you think prices will rebound once temporary exemptions on Iran oil expire?
8815 2018-11-21 16:37:14 @realDonaldTrump is nothing more than a high profile drug dealer/snake oil salesman dressed up like a politician. He's fooled 1/3 of the people & all of the GOP who cower at their own shadow and fear applying the very oversight that could rein him in.
SHAME. They all fail history
8816 2018-11-21 16:37:13 Still emotionally distraught Hillary voters get triggered by Trump thanking the Saudis for low oil prices in view of the recent killing of al Qaida supporter Kashoggi.

...and they ridiculously believe it's Trump's moral compass the one malfunctioning.
8817 2018-11-21 16:37:08 Gonna go ahead and say I’m definitely the winner since I don’t have a car and therefore never need an oil change!
8818 2018-11-21 16:37:06 I think this Tribe need democracy and freedom and give the man with Arrow some oil
8819 2018-11-21 16:37:06 The irony is that the Saudis are NOT driving the gas prices down. It’s our own production of oil that is. We are the largest oil producer in the world. Trump is looking to his personal bottom line here, and he is a traitor who must be locked up.
8820 2018-11-21 16:37:03 Not cheaper oil. Weapons.
And his values standing in the international community of strong armed dictators! He ranks up there with some of his contemporaries, little rocket man, and I'm gonna say maybe that guy from the Philippines?
8821 2018-11-21 16:36:56 More like black market Iranian oil imho.
8822 2018-11-21 16:36:55 Crude oil prices are substantially higher now than we you took office.  Do you ever bother to research anything?
8823 2018-11-21 16:36:50 As a Canadian, I’m outraged how your government has treated Alberta oil producers, and Eastern consumers. Time to get the finger off the auto-applause button and grab some shovels to start digging pipelines

8825 2018-11-21 16:36:45 So u dont like cheap oil? I dont know what your understanding of economics is but i can sense is very poor. Saudi Arabia has a huge responsability in oil prices. I recommend you to read more so you can look less stupid next time.
8826 2018-11-21 16:36:44 Engine flush ain't necessary. Regular oil change, change the plugs and air filter and you're good
8827 2018-11-21 16:36:41 @madmamavotes liberals and their mindset are not normal, I'll take oil prices any day over Kellogg. He was affiliated with Islamic terrorist! That's facts.
8828 2018-11-21 16:36:39 Coconut oil. The one fair in colour or the black one?
8829 2018-11-21 16:36:39 Spike in Oil?? $OIL
8830 2018-11-21 16:36:34 No...carefully created by Trump staffers to appease his high school level base.   That aside..what about the content??? The moral  of the story is kill who you want as long as you write us a big check and sell us cheap oil? (Granted...this is not new under Trump)
8831 2018-11-21 16:36:31 Donald Trump's position on the #JamalKhashoggi murder is vile, revolting and dangerous. But let's not forget that no US president has stood up to Saudi Arabia, preferring oil to principles. Obama did nothing about Yemen. Bush did nothing about 9/11. Etc, etc.
8832 2018-11-21 16:36:30 "Cheap oil absolutely necessary to uphold modern civilisation"

-"Oh no Oil prices are increasing, we're already sliding back. 80$? That's renaissance era! If it reaches 100$ We'll collapse into the middle ages!!!"
8833 2018-11-21 16:36:30 Oil prices are defined not just by Saudi Arabia but by demand and supply.
8834 2018-11-21 16:36:29 It is going to be HDPE. Info hands on from @ra1410vi . He is a project engineer in Oil and Gas and a very approachable knowledgeable humble guy. Thank you. Got to know that Jain Irrigation builds it from ever helpful @RGovins sir. HDPE life is much higher at around 70 yrs or more
8835 2018-11-21 16:36:26 Pdp is a south south party and semi south east party.

They are engulfed in fight to retain oil states when oil is fast becoming irrelevant. 

Watch what will happen after 2019 elections

8837 2018-11-21 16:36:23 So Norwegians & Somalis are gathered in #Nairobi to discuss future of #Somalia offshore oil wtf irony is lost on these ppl! #Kenya Vs #Somalia ICJ still ongoing & Norway fishy deals! Meanwhile Somalia Parliment still obsessing abt #Berbera 
8838 2018-11-21 16:36:18 I see the USA is threatening "dire consequences" to anyone selling oil to Syria. Who the hell do these swine who run the corporate state of America think they are; The leader of the free world, don't make me laugh. I would give that title to Putin before I would to Trump!
8839 2018-11-21 16:36:14 Oil is already running out in lighter
My stomach is nervously burning inside

Meltdown, iroha
8840 2018-11-21 16:36:13 Men vs kids can use this formation.
8841 2018-11-21 16:36:11 #Trump has put a price on human life by standing with Saudi Arabia because of an oil deal. Human life is priceless. If it was his son or his wife he would have a much different attitude. So why is it different when Kashoggi was someone's husband, and someone's son?
8842 2018-11-21 16:36:09 Jesus.....you tweet about lower oil prices as you remain complicit in a murder of a journalist living in the states, ordered by MBS? You’re one sick mother F’er.
8843 2018-11-21 16:36:09 "Right now we have oil prices in great shape. I'm not going to destroy the world economy, and I'm not going to destroy the economy for our country by being foolish with Saudi Arabia," he said.
8844 2018-11-21 16:36:08 How can the US occupy other countries if not for the excuse of being attacked 

Nobody blamed the US when invading the oil rich country Iraq after 9/11, and now the oil fields in Iraq are under western companies control 

Pearl Harbor version2
8845 2018-11-21 16:36:07 We are currently pumping more oil than any other nation on earth, let's cut them off.
8846 2018-11-21 16:36:05 Canada provides more oil/
8847 2018-11-21 16:36:04 Based on the world circumstances.. the fair oil prices would be at $ 65 to $ 75
8848 2018-11-21 16:36:03 We need not yield to Saudi threats re cooperation on peace and oil and arms deals in exchange for overlooking MBS crime We should instead put pressure on them to remain our ally not bargain it away
8849 2018-11-21 16:36:02 Saudi prince murders someone. Lowers oil prices Trump is overjoyed. This man has no soul
8850 2018-11-21 16:36:00 I am not thrilled to thank the Saudis either but when they do something nice it is good manners to say "thank you". My reply to Trump is that the drop in price is nice but it would be great if America did not have to depend on foreign oil.
8851 2018-11-21 16:35:59 Yes. Saudi Arabia, kill whomever you want. Attack our country as you did on 9/11. Our traitor in chief does not care  as long as you keep oil prices down and continue to put money in the pocket of his business
8852 2018-11-21 16:35:58 Sad Saudi Arabia supplies USA with 9 % of oil. 
Canada supplies USA 40 % OIL. 
Trump sucks MURDER Saudi Arabia prince ass. AND SPITS ON CANADA PRIME MINISTER??
I guess prime ministers of Canada CANT OWE TRUMP A ORDER.
8853 2018-11-21 16:35:57 "Saudi Arabia, if we broke with them, I think your oil prices would go through the roof," Trump told reporters on Tuesday.
8854 2018-11-21 16:35:55 Teli ka dimag Lga rahe h,khali se bhi oil nikal rahe h
8855 2018-11-21 16:35:52 1/ In sum, your case = "If the capital flows [measured strictly in USD] don't start again then 4 billion people will starve to death for lack of USDs."  

I assure you, they won't.  If oil & other commodities are priced in USD & CNY, & CNY falls v. USD, commodities will crash.
8856 2018-11-21 16:35:52 Thank you Saudi Arabia- are you kidding they killed a journalist- is that the deal you made with them- they could kill him for lower oil prices- sounds like something you would do - you are disgusting

8860 2018-11-21 16:35:42 @realDonaldTrump Mr President, the oil industry needs $70.00 oil, minimum.  Jobs, jobs, jobs.  Don’t be biased against the energy industry.
8861 2018-11-21 16:35:40 basil, garlic, olive oil=bad?
peanut butter, onion=good?????

8862 2018-11-21 16:35:37 I have hated the Saudi’s since the oil embargo
8863 2018-11-21 16:35:37 Saudi Prince kills American Reporter,   @realDonaldTrump thanks the Saudi gov. for an oil deal. Turns blind eye to murder.  Are we concerned yet of the corruption of this president? #SaudiArabia #Trump #MAGA NOT #RETWEEET @FoxNews @CNN
8864 2018-11-21 16:35:37 This will be the second time Ill adress this, WHERE we get our oil is irrelevant when we consider where its available. If Saudi Arabi slashes oil prices, we will order from there. It is used as a bargaining chip for dealing with Canada and anyone else we get oil from.
8865 2018-11-21 16:35:36 Canada supplies 40% of your oil, he treats us like enemies. Saudi Arabia 5% he treats them like allies. Difference money for himself.
8866 2018-11-21 16:35:32 It has to be big oil money behind this decision.
8867 2018-11-21 16:35:25 Oil prices have fallen due to oversupply recently.
8868 2018-11-21 16:35:24 Hello....United States gets 40% of oil from your Northern neighbor  and 11% from SA...and we don't murder journalists...wake up and smell the bullsh$$t!

The Garbage:
1. Crude Build Slightly Bigger Than Expected
2. 4-Week Avg Gasoline Demand Lowest for the Time Since 2014

The truth:
1. Yesterday's Petrobras hedge execution made crude artificially low

8872 2018-11-21 16:35:15 .@thelauracoates your brilliance requires that more often than not, I agree with you.  On one note, though, I must pushback. I do not believe "WE" need oil; what we NEED, is full speed ahead on renewable energy. THAT would more likely provide hundreds of thousands of

8875 2018-11-21 16:35:07 إملاءات إيرانية تعزيز خسائر قطر النفطية - Iranian dictates boost Qatar oil losses:
8876 2018-11-21 16:35:06 We are the world’s oil producer. The Saudis can’t get weapons from the Chinese or the Russians without years of realignment and about a couple trillion dollars. The Mango Menace obfuscates and the media regurgitates. Call him on his bullshit!  Don’t give it oxygen!
8877 2018-11-21 16:35:03 I pay 3.59 a gallon right now, how is THAT lower oil prices. Gaslighting, no pun intended, as usual. We are paying Bush era type prices.
8878 2018-11-21 16:35:00 Don’t we get more oil from Canada?
8879 2018-11-21 16:34:59 We would recommend the all (you)calyptus (essential oil blend) or the musk-have (violet and sandalwood)  P.S. the musk-have is only available for subscribers at this time 
8880 2018-11-21 16:34:57 “My name is Inigio Montoya, you killed my father. Prepare to carry on as usual, because... oil prices,” said no one ever.
8881 2018-11-21 16:34:55 So it was really thank you Canada for supplying most of the oil imported
8882 2018-11-21 16:34:53 We reportedly receive 11% of our oil from the Saudis, 40% from Canada. So the idea that lower oil prices are solely the doing of SA is a ridiculous con that only a hardened Trump supporter would believe.
8883 2018-11-21 16:34:50 Trump’s caught between a rock and hard place in this situation  but with any action against the Kingdom.. The Saudis could cut oil production and oil prices would skyrocket and pull billions in defense/military contracts resulting in lose of thousands of US jobs..so what to do?
8884 2018-11-21 16:34:47 That would lead one to believe that they were ones responsible for the cost of oil to be so high before then right
8885 2018-11-21 16:34:46 Bull shit. It's American oil to thank not kiss Saudi ass.
8886 2018-11-21 16:34:42 Green beans or Brussels sprouts tossed in olive oil, minced garlic, fresh pepper and a little salt. In the toaster oven till browning.
8887 2018-11-21 16:34:39 Are you that naive. One country does not control oil prices. It's a global thing. You love these thuggish leaders and go overboard to kiss their behinds while belittling Americans. Why don't you move to one of these countries since you love them obviously more than America.
8888 2018-11-21 16:34:37 Water and oil don’t mix
8889 2018-11-21 16:34:36 What a gorgeous painting! I'm a little jealous of everyone's awesome oil paintings, someday I'm going to bite the bullet and get my hands on some oil paints! 
8890 2018-11-21 16:34:32 Ahhh so the death of an American Journalist is worth a discount on oil for a short period. Good to know you'd probably sell us all out for a McMuffin.
8891 2018-11-21 16:34:29 Maybe oil prices dropped because of more oil right here
8892 2018-11-21 16:34:28 I for a log time was thinking that Russia could be 4% + GDP growth. They have everything,I always laugh when i see western "experts" saying Russia needs western tech to extract oil and gas from Arctic.They forgot that Russians were first to send man in space. They figure it out.
8893 2018-11-21 16:34:25 My friend unfortunately v c sometimes from the optics of our media. Remember  last time indian FM cancelling the scheduled meeting at UNGA wd our FM at the very eleventh hour so who it was who didn't want 2talk?
I went 2 india n really realized how ur media is putting oil on fire
8894 2018-11-21 16:34:18 Canada sends more oil to US than SA. I don't see dumpster kissing Trudeaus ass!
We're currently in trouble with them because we criticized their human rights. They pulled all their students out of the country! We still get their oil but we said our piece.
8895 2018-11-21 16:34:18 Instead of discussing minutia of NAFTA 2.0 please use your bully pulpit to decry Trump’s embrace of a murderer for cheaper oil
8896 2018-11-21 16:34:17 @sharon_capehart Hi Sharon. Can you put a drop or two of Marula Oil in your shampoo?
8897 2018-11-21 16:34:16 The Left attack POTUS like children towards other students. Totally illogical and wide open for counters. They are so easily beaten. But why? They’re so bent on progressive or faster paced socialism. And the war on coal, natural gas and oil.
8898 2018-11-21 16:34:15 The Saudis has positively responded to the request of @realDonaldTrump, to keep oil prices at reasonable levels. Therefore justice for #JamalKashoggi can wait

Journalists around the world, be careful, there could be a deal over our dead body @cnni @BBCWorld @WSJ @washingtonpost
8899 2018-11-21 16:34:13 Tea tree oil will DEF dry that fucker up hahaha
8900 2018-11-21 16:34:08 And today he thanked Saudi Arabia for lower oil prices.
8901 2018-11-21 16:34:06 Average oil price 2015:  $49.49. No one was killed and dissolved by the Saudis to get that price.
8902 2018-11-21 16:34:05 You are such a despicable man!! They murdered a man who resided in the US and you’re thanking Saudi Arabia for oil prices? #BloodMoney
8903 2018-11-21 16:34:05 FDA would never have approved the placebo if it was harmful.  Your question has a false premise, as does your writing  generally on this subject.  There is no way to know why LDL went up slightly for placebo recipients.  But you treat it as fact that it was “harmful” mineral oil.

8905 2018-11-21 16:34:02 Hey dirty Donnie, Saudi Arabia does not control oil prices,they are set by the commodities market. Low oil prices does not excuse murder. Besides, Canada is our largest supplier, NOT Saudi Arabia. Thanks Canada!!
8906 2018-11-21 16:34:01 Erm...thanks.
*What's he after? Or is he still sniffing cannabis oil?
8907 2018-11-21 16:34:01 Maybe we are better off seeing just what we can get from ending our investigation into the Saudi Prince and seeing how low we can get the price of oil from them! Obama allowed Christians to be beheaded and burned alive while counting Iran with piles of cash and worthless treaties
8908 2018-11-21 16:33:59 Neatly rolling up your sleaves and slightly loosening your tie doesn't mean you know anything about the economics of the country.  If you did, you wouldn't be making every effort to keep our oil in the ground.
8909 2018-11-21 16:33:58 Listen you Nat Gas nuts. In New England we use heating oil.. HO and wood.. and the mummified bodies of yankee fans and we’re Just fine.
8910 2018-11-21 16:33:58 The US gets a fairly small percentage of its oil from the Saudis (~11%). We get almost 4 times as much from Canada (~40%). If we didn’t get any oil from Saudi Arabia the incremental cost to get that oil elsewhere would be very small / non-existent.

@FoxNews is full of shit.
8911 2018-11-21 16:33:57 And given the wildly exaggerated claims about Saudi purchases of US-made weapons, and the naive thinking about how oil prices work, it's really all about the $$$ flowing into the Trump organization, right?
8912 2018-11-21 16:33:51 HI. I NEED BAKED MAC AND CHEESE RECIPES ASAP. “When you warm it up , oil in ya plate” kind of recipes.

8914 2018-11-21 16:33:45 Federal deficit growing out of control as is the Federal Debt. How much are US oil producers losing?
8915 2018-11-21 16:33:43 We are not willing to trade lives and our morality for a tax cut. Even if we were, national debt is up, the stock market is down and Saudi only provides a small fraction of our oil. Some negotiator you are.
8916 2018-11-21 16:33:36 That will hurt domestic oil workers, especially in west Texas.  They voted for Cruz thinking he would protect their jobs but low oil prices will send them to the unemployment line.
8917 2018-11-21 16:33:35 Just means that Saudis are trying to put American Oil Producers out of business. Again a swing and a miss
8918 2018-11-21 16:33:35 Here are facts for the @FoxNews crew:
1-Oil price plunge is due to rising supply & economic slowdown fears
2-Drop coincides w/2nd consecutive day of steep US stock market losses
3-US gets only 8% of is oil from the Saudis
4-OPEC will meet soon to draw back supply & boost prices
8919 2018-11-21 16:33:34 Yea for the President.  Oil goes lower...  Our values are not being sold.
8920 2018-11-21 16:33:34 What's a barrel of integrity going for these days? I'd be a lot happier with that, than with lower prices of crude...oil, that is.
8921 2018-11-21 16:33:31 Falling oil prices great tax break .20 cents a gallon Whippie. I’m sure it’s gonna be a drag on energy stocks. great looking for the stock market there goes my 401(k) but I got $.20 back a gallon thanks Mr. President

8928 2018-11-21 16:33:23 Saudi’s killing a Saudi National in Turkey is not our business nor should we cut off relations with SA costing thousands of us jobs and billions out of Americans pocket books as oil price increases. We are not world police.
8929 2018-11-21 16:33:23 Well russia should bomb oil fields under US control
8930 2018-11-21 16:33:19 Yes but the Angel Moms can't cause an economic disaster by cutting our oil off.
8931 2018-11-21 16:33:19 YES! Thanks Saudi Arabia! And just keep killing journalists as long as the oil prices are low and we will look away apparently
8932 2018-11-21 16:33:13 Saudi Arabia is still supplying enough crude oil to the US to effect oil / gas prices. If they drastically slash prices, or for a short period provide a large quantity of oil, that could temporarily drive oil / gas prices lower for a period. Also their pricing is used as a B chip
8933 2018-11-21 16:33:12 You realize the oil price is low because the greedy oil producers have flooded the market, right?  They did not do that for you. It was all about trying to maximize their profits. Your comments suggest you did not complete high school.
8934 2018-11-21 16:33:10 Oil price per barrel has reduced from $82 to $54 per barrel but South Africans did not see the reduction... WHY???
8935 2018-11-21 16:33:09 It's both.  Most oil companies are down.  Wft for example may need to file for chap 11 bankruptcy to get out of financial problems.  Chk down 40%, hse, eca all down, some at 52wk lows, and have moved to bearish territory.
8936 2018-11-21 16:33:08 What is the taste of #Khashoggi's blood?
With what cleaner, you want to clear #Khashoggi's blood from your hands and mouth and from the hands and mouth of #BinSalman?  With #Oil!
Shame!
Now, the free world knows that #Trump is a crime partner of #MohammedBinSalman.
8937 2018-11-21 16:33:06 Gas prices have been dropping because the dollar is strengthening. When the dollar is weak, oil goes up and vis-a-versa.
8938 2018-11-21 16:33:05 Aside from 1 season really there hasn’t been much to be positive about over the last decade...
8939 2018-11-21 16:33:04 True story, I have a friend here who had a client smear coconut oil all over their body right before they got down to business, but directly after my friend told them she was allergic to all things coconut.
8940 2018-11-21 16:33:02 An infestation of dots, thousands of them, represent oil wells in the Permian basin of West Texas and a slice of New Mexico. In less than a decade, U.S. companies have drilled 114,000. Many of them would turn a profit even with crude prices as low as $30 a barrel.
8941 2018-11-21 16:33:01 We only import 11% of our oil from Saudi Arabia. You should really thank Canada. Plus, why are celebrating a regime that just murdered a journalist? Worst president ever.
8942 2018-11-21 16:32:56 We must stand on our foot,rather than run here and there and looks  for aids,loans. This is short term remedy to overcome economic crisis.Cut expenditures,Reduce imports,make energy conservation policies to cut in in oil and gas imports bills.
8943 2018-11-21 16:32:51 You do know we get most of our oil from CANADA right?
8944 2018-11-21 16:32:49 AGREED and both net oil consumers not producers
8945 2018-11-21 16:32:49 We produce almost 40% of our oil, thanks to POTUS not Obama. ..
8946 2018-11-21 16:32:49 ever since i read that tweet from a british person saying “why do americans call it gas when it’s oil” my life has known no peace
8947 2018-11-21 16:32:48 You need to check with Putin. For a while now he has been saying that oil prices are already too low.
8948 2018-11-21 16:32:45 Low? Where? Also, motor oil is up .  Had to grab 2 quarts for car was over 10 bucks. And that was non synthetic.
8949 2018-11-21 16:32:45 Hypocrisy knows no bounds in this administration, it's not even funny anymore it's the actions of a traitor!!

8955 2018-11-21 16:32:33 I’d rather have to walk everywhere I need to go than pay the price of that oil you just sold us out on and I’m disabled. This is sickening and such a sad day for America. My apologies to #JamalKhashoggi family and my to #SaudiArabia and @realDonaldTrump
8956 2018-11-21 16:32:28 Wouldn't this raise the price of oil, which means fuel will cost more.

8959 2018-11-21 16:32:23 We know the price of a human life in the US, guns , war heads, and oil
8960 2018-11-21 16:32:19 Endorsing books now? Or trying to do anything to cover the fact that you just endorsed a murderer and embraced their behaviours cuz of oil?!!
8961 2018-11-21 16:32:14 Cause the U.S. & Russia are producing a lot is partly why the oil prices are low & a bigger supply than demand. OPEC usually cuts down production to drive prices back up. OPEC is trying to drive its American competitors out of businesses by flooding the mkt. Thanks Saudi Arabia
8962 2018-11-21 16:32:13 Regulatory lenience never does anyone any good except for the oil companies. Governments snivel and capitulate in exchange for the delicious tax carrot. Meanwhile spills keep happening and they are like ‘oh it’s best left to the wolf to mind the hen house, don’t you agree’
8963 2018-11-21 16:32:13 "In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia."

8969 2018-11-21 16:32:07 Except Saudi Arabia only supplies 11% of Americas oil. Canada is at 40%. This Trump statement like most things out of his mouth is bullshit.
8970 2018-11-21 16:32:06 (1/2) Continued development of the Vaca Muerta’s shale gas formation in Neuquen will allow Argentina to: multiple its crude oil and natural gas reserves by factors of 5 and 14, respectively; sell oil and gas to the world; activate all of its productive sectors; ...
8971 2018-11-21 16:32:05 Because oil prices would go through the roof, the Russians and Chinese would get the arms business, the streets of America would erupt in violence, cars would get turned upside down, looting, Democrats would destroy our government, greatest disaster in human history...blah, blah
8972 2018-11-21 16:32:03 Now it's even more obvious why Trumps' tariffs on solar panels was the first tariff imposed! Those F-ing rich politicians try to control the country using God and oil- get smart people!
8973 2018-11-21 16:32:01 Green bean casserole, the good one.  French style green beans, artichokes, Parmesan cheese, olive oil blended and baked.  A favorite anytime of year.
8974 2018-11-21 16:32:01 So it is ok to murder people in trade for lower oil prices. By the way everyone knows there are not millions of jobs at stake and hundreds of billions in gun sales. The Saudi's play you like North Korea does, just leading you along with compliments. Sad.
8975 2018-11-21 16:31:58 So to RECAP:
   TRUMP criticized Germany for getting oil from Russia.

Trump says America First as excuse for getting our oil from journalist murdering Saudi's! "Our economy would fail".
No, your Apartment and building funding would fail!
   "I love saudi they buy my buildings"
8976 2018-11-21 16:31:57 RULE #1 of successful electoral politics
* Focus on persuadable swing voters
* Ignore  views of irreconcilable opponents
* Motivate the base with symbolic gestures
In terms of 2020, Rule #1 means White House has strong interest in moderate oil prices (probably $50 < WTI < $65)
8977 2018-11-21 16:31:54 You murdered a journalist and chopped him up, you lot are in trouble
"We will cut oil prices"
What journalist?
"Deal then?
Yes, and I have some personal properties for sale, if you're interested?
8978 2018-11-21 16:31:53 Most of our oil comes from Canada. He’s just condoning murder because he does business with them.
8979 2018-11-21 16:31:51 He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.
The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright.

Proverbs 21:17-18
8980 2018-11-21 16:31:50 We have enough oil for ourselves we don’t need to sell ours or buy somebody else’s, let’s control our own prices by keeping what we drill for, that’s smart business!!
8981 2018-11-21 16:31:50 Since you've been President it doesn't seem America can go any lower. Somehow you figure out how to drag us further into a cesspool of greed and corruption. Blood for oil. How does it feel to have a murder on your soul?
8982 2018-11-21 16:31:49 Oil seeps happen all along the Atlantic margin, on both the western and eastern shores from Greenland to Patagonia and Norway to South Africa. We use satellite imagery to look for seeps, in order to learn where to explore.
8983 2018-11-21 16:31:49 “Decency” is when you want the people responsible to come to justice. Not praise them for “lowering oil prices “! To not confront the truth and bend over and kiss the feet of the guilty one is cowardice!
8984 2018-11-21 16:31:47 the DUMBEST POUTS in history (yes dumber GW Bush) has again,spoken.....

8991 2018-11-21 16:31:25 So, is that why you gave SA a pass for murdering a US resident?

After you helped screw them a bit on the oil, by allowing the Iran oil exemptions.
8992 2018-11-21 16:31:25 @POTUS As a supporter of you, I am appalled by the thought to drop oil prices more? We need to stabilize yes, however lower means people lose jobs, lifestyles! We work hard in the oilfield to provide, don't take it away! Let's export more and import less!
8993 2018-11-21 16:31:23 That must’ve been before she made $100 million from denying regular people healthcare, and collecting enormous donations from big oil and gas companies and big pharmaceutical companies. She’s against everything we are for. Everything.
8994 2018-11-21 16:31:21 I'm going to have to disagree. If oil goes much lower, companies will slow down production this costing jobs. I work in the patch, I've seen it happen.
8995 2018-11-21 16:31:21 See Bill, the whole world is talking about Saudi Arabia, Ivanka and her emails, oil prices , stock market, even the Mueller investigation ending, and here you are by yourself yelling “Caravan!” I have no spin, I am honest. Please Bill, you going to pay us all off?

9001 2018-11-21 16:31:13 Concerns: high interest rates, crashing oil prices, stalling economic growth, the fading effects of tax cuts, tariffs and, of course, the US-China trade war.  Ok, So oil is a little cheaper....but everything else is taking a hit, which causes the oil prices decline.  Not good.
9002 2018-11-21 16:31:13 NOTHING to do with OIL
9003 2018-11-21 16:31:12 Happy Thanksgiving friends & family at home. Enjoy your lower oil prices...

...Canada also doesn’t dismember journalists, feel like I need to toss that fun fact out there jic.
9014 2018-11-21 16:30:53 “You want to know why it tastes so good? I beat it thoroughly for 20 minutes, half it over two jugs and just before it’s ready, I put my finger in to check the temperature and finish it off with some olive oil.....”

9017 2018-11-21 16:30:50 I did not understand why our government always kisses Saudi butt. I remember back in the 70’s everyone freaking out over oil from the Middle East. Was this just another tactic too raise prices? I was in my early teens so I didn’t get it all but my dad used to say that.
9018 2018-11-21 16:30:50 So the oil prices going down are also increasing our countries deficit to it's highest point at the fastest rate ever in history too?! #LiarInChief #TaxScam

Would be ok but I've been trying to run down the old wood supplies in order to save the oil to keep the house from freezing while I'm back in Scotland. May need to come back in Jan to check levels and buy more.
9020 2018-11-21 16:30:48 ARAMCO can in fact, impact oil prices by under or over production, as can most oil producing nations, but the open market ultimately decides the price of crude. However, we are being lied to again. And again.
9021 2018-11-21 16:30:47 There is nothing accurate in this tweet. You are lying about oil prices to prop up and justify praising murderers. You are a sick, twisted, disgraceful human being. I loathe you. #JusticeForJamal
9022 2018-11-21 16:30:47 and his statement about keeping oil prices stable is ridiculous.
9023 2018-11-21 16:30:42 Obama didn’t need to sacrifice a journalist for lower oil prices #JustSayin
9024 2018-11-21 16:30:41 Trump lying again this morning. He is claiming that the Saudis are responsible for the drop in crude oil prices. Actually, the US produces more oil than the Saudis and Russia and there is a glut of oil on the market at this time. Stock market, flat for this year Donald!

We get more oil from Canada than Saudi Arabia, so what with kissing the Saudi’s rear. We have values which are not for sale. You hate Canada. We don’t.

This being said, the Bosphorus University was the first American University outside of the US, though today it’s entirely run by Turks.
9034 2018-11-21 16:30:23 Probably was.
I can imagine Trump went with the line of "look, we'll keep a lid on all this Khashoggi shit if you lower the price on oil."
9035 2018-11-21 16:30:22 Why not bury them with their mummy. But no he puts them in oil he was covering up his crime on them and possibly his violation of them. The oil evidence was truly hard to read 
9036 2018-11-21 16:30:21 What is this Country coming to, thanking a murderous, who only gives us a few percentage of oil. @realDonaldTrump is saying it's ok 2 chop up journalists because they've been good to him. I totally believe that only air lives in his head
9037 2018-11-21 16:30:20 They killed and dismembered a reporter. Yet you celebrate lower oil prices? #WorsePOTUSEver
9038 2018-11-21 16:30:16 So one thousand dinars to the $. Knowing next to nothing about the dinar it might be difficult to sell in this sort of market. If Fed keeps strengthening the dollar and price of oil keeps declining dinar should lose more value.

9040 2018-11-21 16:30:09 Yes, even though the largest supplier of oil to the US is actually Canada at 40%. Saudi Arabia supplies only 11%.
9041 2018-11-21 16:30:08 You can’t go any lower and neither can they.  Shameful you value oil prices more then human life  I’m embarrassed to be an American
9042 2018-11-21 16:30:08 Glad you could trade a human life for reduced oil prices. Way to go.
9043 2018-11-21 16:30:06 Enjoy your oil?
9044 2018-11-21 16:30:06 The oil price are going doing down due to increase on shale oil output in the US. The americans who still value human life can’t believe you thank to a country that kill a journalist just for low oil gas price. You don’t even have the balls to ear the killing records.
9045 2018-11-21 16:30:05 How much to wanna bet the Crown Prince told Trump he'd raise the price of oil sky high if Trump didn't back down so TRUMPY folded for political reasons.
9046 2018-11-21 16:30:05 Long term investment decisions for the world’s largest oil producer are being made by AJ Soprano.

9055 2018-11-21 16:29:35 US PRODUCTION OF OIL & HIGH MILLEAGE CARS...TELL THAT TO THE CRIMMINAL IN THE WHITE HOUSE !!!
9056 2018-11-21 16:29:35 Full agree. But we know the solution, it's pretty easy: Print money and keep oil prices low. This will keep inflation low and leads to rising prices in all asset classes. This will be good for cryptos too.
9057 2018-11-21 16:29:30 Who cares about the brutal murder of journalist when you can get low oil prices. Proving once again that everything is for sale in the land of Trump. #KhashoggiMurder
9058 2018-11-21 16:29:29 He probably doesn't even realize that low oil prices hurt Russia. If he does,  you can be sure that he has nothing to do with oil prices. It also hurts the shale oil industry. Maybe that is the real reason they are low. I
9059 2018-11-21 16:29:24 Blood for oil?

You foolish little tyrrant.
9060 2018-11-21 16:29:23 Wow. The Saudis must need a cigarette now after the murder denial BJ and the oil price thank you “reach around”. You are weak and transparent.

Heat in toaster oven for 40 mins or until beginning to brown (flipping toward the end). Repeat with small potatoes cut in half, brown face down. Then Brussel sprouts (less time) xo

9065 2018-11-21 16:29:15 @realDonaldTrump as an oilfield wife, this is not good! We are just coming back from the Obama era oil bust. Please help keep the blue collar workers of AMERICA working!
9066 2018-11-21 16:29:13 Blood for Oil, eh?
9067 2018-11-21 16:29:12 I think I agree that a first round loss might not be enough to save him, despite the major improvement from last season. 

For me, I still wonder why coaching change wasn't made sooner. Success this season would increase my frustration that Mclellan lasted so long.

9083 2018-11-21 16:28:34 Why aren't you directing this tweet at Canada since they expire 4x more oil to us than Saudia Arabia? Remember all those pipelines we protested two years ago?
9084 2018-11-21 16:28:32 We can even put olive oil on ice cream
9085 2018-11-21 16:28:32 Note the legislation must still be constitutional. Restricting production or total amount of exports would be within provincial jurisdiction. Saying that oil cannot be exported to BC is not.

9086 2018-11-21 16:28:31 Hey Moron, It's the USA that is causing the oil prices to drop. You would know that if you ever read a word of any report on your table. Get your head out of the Saudi's ass.
9087 2018-11-21 16:28:29 The squeaky wheel gets the oil
9088 2018-11-21 16:28:18 Thank you Saudi Arabia, for butchering and killing Americans. I'm paying a nickel less at the pump so it's worth it. By the way Mr. President, we get 11% of our oil from the Saudis, 40% from Canada. Happy Thanksgiving.

9090 2018-11-21 16:28:13 There is a floor price that the Saudi's won't let the oil price fall below so as to finance a war

9094 2018-11-21 16:28:04 This is TRUMP FIRST,  America has NEVER, NEVER looked the other way on such moral issue.

You have over stated a paper 10 year possible 14.5B  arms deal, purpsed, no guarantee, 
Jobs about 20 a year
Oil prices you have no real say over. SO as I Say This is TRUMP ORG FIRST.
9095 2018-11-21 16:28:02 I need to go get my oil changed today before my 4 hour drive to Houston in the morning, but the thought of social contact today is making me nauseous already. 
9096 2018-11-21 16:28:01 For me. I guna je pape perfume, body mist, yg rasa selesa utk tido. Baby oil pun byk. Baby cologne ke baby balm byk on market.The smells help me to sleep. Not necessarily EO. Coz me too, couldn’t afford them. Just my two cents
9097 2018-11-21 16:27:56 @ court today they dropped my thc oil charge so anyone who talked shit can eat my fucking dick  thanks
9098 2018-11-21 16:27:53 garnier yg oil infused hehe
9099 2018-11-21 16:27:53 When the economy bursts and oil prices skyrocket will you take responsibility for that?
9100 2018-11-21 16:27:52 That’s not a tax cut you little orange man. They also don’t supply the majority of our oil/gas. The murdered a journalist!!! For the love of God please start acting like a sane person with morals. Where are the Evangelist that support you?
9101 2018-11-21 16:27:51 What ever happened to Peak Oil? 
9102 2018-11-21 16:27:49 Oil prices are a cheap consolation for the murder of a journalist and the loss of a protected free press. Thank you to Saudi Arabia for appealing to the USA to cover up its dastardly deeds
9103 2018-11-21 16:27:46 Here’s your answer: the prices are down because the market is saturated at the moment. Trading oil for human lives is disgusting. You should be ashamed for suggesting it, comrade. That’s not how we do things here in America.
9104 2018-11-21 16:27:45 No it’s about “me first”. Oil prices have tanked but he will still double down because he stands to make lots of money after we punt him out.
9105 2018-11-21 16:27:43 You do understand how this works you complete and total useless piece of Skin?? Instead of being on your knees in front of the Crown Prince why don't you ask @PressSec how Oil Prices works....OMG YOU ARE SO INCREDIBLY DISTURBED NOBODY COULD BE THIS STUPID!!
9106 2018-11-21 16:27:41 Bring them home then. WTF are they fighting for. Oil?
9107 2018-11-21 16:27:41 Hi Kate! Although we don't currently have a shampoo bar specifically for coloured hair, coloured hair can use our shampoos - although I would advise a more moisturising one like Honey I washed My Hair, Jason and he Argan Oil or Trichomania

9109 2018-11-21 16:27:36 ND/OK/KS/TX oil rigs struggle and begin planning to shutdown.  TY @realDonaldTrump 

Can they go back an vote over?
9110 2018-11-21 16:27:35 Oil prices should reach $10k a barrel. Too high for anyone to buy. Time to advance past OPEC and switch to 100% renewable.
9111 2018-11-21 16:27:34 And when the dire consequences continue not to come to pass? What then will all of you sycophants that have been peddling this snake oil for how many decades now? But this time, things will definitely be different right? Is your nickname Henny Penny?
9112 2018-11-21 16:27:26 Thank you President Trump for helping to lower our oil prices so low. I hope we see the lower prices real soon in our bills. Many don’t know
9113 2018-11-21 16:27:22 @FionaDecleorUK so pleased to get my hands on the @DecleorUK TSV but massively disappointed to see that my Lavandula Iris oil has leaked in transit and I’ve lost about a 1/4 of the bottle  @qvcuk have been helpful but not the same as getting it in perfect condition!  Gutted
9114 2018-11-21 16:27:20 I see you know his stocks in oil, now show us how much you made off the overseas Iran deal, Muslim loving women trafficking DMC pimp
9115 2018-11-21 16:27:19 An agreement between the Government and oil producers to fix supply is a price conspiracy. Legislation that restricts production/exports is not an agreement—more of a unilateral action by the Legislature.

My favourite quote of all time
9121 2018-11-21 16:27:15 Mr Braid is simply promoting Jason Kenney here. It is the purpose of the article. They are in full frontal Go-Jason mode. Only he can make the oil fairytale come true. The next months will be an assault on truth.
9122 2018-11-21 16:27:14 You misspelled Canada. (Canada 40% of our oil vs SA 11%) #LyingFuckwad
9123 2018-11-21 16:27:14 Does he not know we have our own oil reserves and that other countries are happy to sell us oil.  Or maybe we could reduce oil consumption in new ways. What an idiot.
9124 2018-11-21 16:27:10 It would be nice if rural America's pump prices would come down, they have done nothing but rise to this day. Big Oil is also the problem with unfair pricing and raising prices based on rumors of war, storms, less consumption to more consumption thereby driving the market higher!

9129 2018-11-21 16:27:04 @msnbc @cnn Trump believes money is more important than a US reporter being murdered by this oil Prince! Trump has committed Treason to the US too many times! He needs to be impeached! Citizens and politicians need to be out raged!
9130 2018-11-21 16:26:59 Low oil prices you could almost kill for......
9131 2018-11-21 16:26:59 Also there was an oil crash
9132 2018-11-21 16:26:57 Who’s he going to blame when oil prices reverse and start to rise, as they eventually will?
9133 2018-11-21 16:26:57 9 percent of our oil comes from Arabia stupid
9134 2018-11-21 16:26:56 Yesterday’s #BRI deal between Duterte and Xi Jinping on gas and oil includes Chinese support for reconstruction of Marawi - implications for stability in this fragile corner of Southeast Asia?
9135 2018-11-21 16:26:51 It’s very sad state of affairs, America used to be the leader of the free world, now apparently nothing else matters except for cheaper oil..
9136 2018-11-21 16:26:51 We need to keep pointing out that Obama didn’t need to sacrifice journalists to keep oil prices down. We all know little hands big loans Trump is just covering up his own family’s involvement.

9140 2018-11-21 16:26:40 Did you talk about who killed in France last 2 days.
If a person want to hurt your country, will police STOP or not?
Many people killed everywhere in the world to protect US.
9141 2018-11-21 16:26:40 Canada supplies 40% of oil to the States while Saudi Arabia only supplies 11%. #PresidentTwatWaffle is worried about his own financial losses if he were to take a stance.
9142 2018-11-21 16:26:39 I tried a new essential oil blend for my diffuser last night called “sweet dreams” and then had a dream I killed someone. But hey at least i got some sleep, right?!
9143 2018-11-21 16:26:36 You are not the reason for the lower oil prices,its supply and demand.Stop taking credit for good things and take some credit for the f ups you do.
9144 2018-11-21 16:26:36 All distractions. Lower the Barrel price of oil more!
9145 2018-11-21 16:26:35 I have been trading oil for 30 years. If there is one thing I have learned in that time it is that the Saudi's want Oil prices as high as possible. Opec follows elasiticity of demand models and nothing else. Sad to say, our president is an idiot.
9146 2018-11-21 16:26:33 And we get most of our oil from Canada anyway, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
9147 2018-11-21 16:26:32 Saudi Arabia only provides 11% of US oil.
9148 2018-11-21 16:26:31 We get 40% of our oil from Canada! Only 9% from Saudi Arabi! Please research your facts!
9149 2018-11-21 16:26:27 #oott today brent and crude differentiated %1. Arround 40 cents favor of Crude. We will see is it stays like that or fixing in daily as risining or falling. EURUSD is not changed much. #crudeoil #usoil #oil

9154 2018-11-21 16:26:14 POTUS tweeted thanks to SA for low oil prices. In other words, he closed a deal with the devil by winking at a brutal murder.

9167 2018-11-21 16:25:49 People want to act like Saudi Arabia is new to doing terrible things and its Trump’s fault. Trump isn’t helping, but that country’s princes funded 9/11 and we did nothing. The world lets them get away with crimes in return for oil.
9168 2018-11-21 16:25:47 I stg the men at jiffy lube SCAM TF out of me every time. I said I just wanted an oil change, who cares about my ‘low tire pressure’ or my broken wind shield wiper? Certainly not me. Do what you’re fucking told.
9169 2018-11-21 16:25:39 No thank you. The impending tarrif wars that you so cleverly started by imposing tarrifs on anyone that moves have spooked the stock markets. This in turn has knocked the price of oil. So well done you. New umbrellas all round.
9170 2018-11-21 16:25:39 They are also over-producing to damage the gas and oil industry in the United States. I'm sure he is perfectly aware of that, right?

9175 2018-11-21 16:25:23 And besides that, tanking oil prices eat into the profitability and growth prospects of major US energy production and exploration companies. Nobody can produce oil as cheaply as Saudi Arabia.
9176 2018-11-21 16:25:22 With the US now producing more oil than both Saudi Arabia and Russia and  growing sentiment that global markets are amply supplied, “traders are  selling crude down and down” reports Oil Price.
9177 2018-11-21 16:25:20 To quiet all the criticisms of the killing of a journalist by their top ruler, Saudi Arabia is trying to bribe the whole world by lowering the oil price. And DJT is doing his part in helping SA's efforts. What a corrupted POS this man is. Speechless.
9178 2018-11-21 16:25:18 That's why Oil and gas is more expensive under you than it was under @BarackObama
9179 2018-11-21 16:25:17 We should be supplying oil to the US.
9180 2018-11-21 16:25:17 -Besides giving us oil the Saudis are one of few powerful allies we have in the middle east. Hence why the U.S. let's them , literally, get away with murder. It's not right but few things are. Also historically the U.S. has done far worse than kill journalists. IJS #TheView
9181 2018-11-21 16:25:15 This is appalling. Do you think that people dont care that someone died if we can get a little cheaper oil. NO, we are not evil and corrupt. Lives over $$.

9185 2018-11-21 16:25:11 Nicolle, doesn't DJT always say that we are not dependent on mid-eastern oil any more? Are we supposed to understand? Can anyone understand?
9186 2018-11-21 16:25:11  TRAVEL 

M1 northbound is CLOSED at J25 for #Nottingham! There's an oil spillage after an accident earlier on. Obvs v. long queues. Traffic's being diverted around the junction, off and on again.
9187 2018-11-21 16:25:07 Today I spoke with someone educated with an experience to head a Modular Refinery who told me in simple terms " Buhari is Jubrin". - I just couldn't stop laughing - Buhari is so lucky that people will rather say its an imposter 'Jubrin' than accept Buhari as a failure!
9188 2018-11-21 16:25:06 You moron lower price will lead to higher consumption, and oil is a finite resource. So it isn't sustainable, is it? You will enjoy it in the short term, but what will you do in the future when oil runs out?
9189 2018-11-21 16:25:05 saudis are good at even 54 but greed makes it 82 , its not 60's-70's oil is everywhere even  54 is artificially high but 82 is ripping off
9190 2018-11-21 16:25:04 clearly devoid if anyone can convince you that recession was caused by anything other than oil industry crash
9191 2018-11-21 16:25:03 And we get 40% of our imported oil from Canada, 11% from Saudi Arabia.  

It’s never about what’s good for America: it’s always about what’s good for #LyingDonnyBoneSpurs.  

“They buy apartments from me for $50 million.  I love the Saudis!”
9192 2018-11-21 16:25:02 more on OIL .. Id bet if you take away Central Bank meddling oil wld be living below $40 for 5yrs

let all that new bad debt domino

ffs ..
9193 2018-11-21 16:25:01 Thanks Iran for still selling oil.... there ya go - fixed

9195 2018-11-21 16:24:59 Maybe I will be able to fill my oil tank for winter .Been nickel and diming it for the last 4 years butning kerosene or diesel. Thank you Mr. President
9196 2018-11-21 16:24:55 Nah. You highlight the good and the bad.
9197 2018-11-21 16:24:50 They probably contain palm oil so will give them a miss 
9198 2018-11-21 16:24:48 Thanks Canada! And @JustinTrudeau for selling us 40% of our oil. Since the @GOP gave all of our money to corporations and rich people we need any help you can send. Please don't build a wall to keep us out we're not all like the #LiarInChief #gangsterinthewhitehouse
9199 2018-11-21 16:24:47 In addition to mixing up multiple indexes - Brent is y-o-y ~even, and is still +15% since 1/2017.  And in a world where the US now exports twice what it did just 5 years ago (which itself was 2.5x 5-years prior), $30 oil is not obviously as good as it once was.
9200 2018-11-21 16:24:43 la boy done blew me early  then I’m even more pissed off cause that’s all he want eat is junk (the reason why the cooking oil is all over the floor & counter)

9203 2018-11-21 16:24:40 I wonder if any is in the engine. Just waiting to block the strainer for the oil pump pickup ?
9204 2018-11-21 16:24:40 Cheap oil?  How about cheap gas.  Still paying $4 a gallon. WHO IS KEEPING THE DIFFERENCE???
9205 2018-11-21 16:24:39 The ‘you don’t fan like I fan so your fandom is lesser than mine, go cheer for someone else’ group is the kidney stone of Oiler Twitter.
9206 2018-11-21 16:24:35 IDK, oil traded as low as $44 in 2016. 
But I hear ya.
9207 2018-11-21 16:24:35 Yet unable to interdict entire ISIS convoys of tanker trucks taking oil stolen from Syria across an open desert to be sold to Turkey for revenue to fund ISIS operations?
9208 2018-11-21 16:24:22 I’m about be pop if u can’t get a oil change before one 
9209 2018-11-21 16:24:18 I see..klau cleansing oil mmg akn ada alcohol ngan mineral oil ke? Ada tak brand yg tak guna alcohol? If Neutrogena sya bca mmg dia ada alcohol dgn mineral oil...
9210 2018-11-21 16:24:17 coconut oil + peppermint for the post wash win
9211 2018-11-21 16:24:17 Oil prices mirror Trump’s approval ratings. Let’s see how low both can go!!!
9212 2018-11-21 16:24:14 They always drop oil prices when there's a crisis.  Post 9/11 there was a brief push in public opinion towards renewables, essentially a permanent fix for Islamic terrorism, but the Saudis dropped oil prices and killed the movement.
9213 2018-11-21 16:24:14 I wonder what's Trump conversion formula on Saudi Arabia!

"If you drive oil prices $2 lower, you are allowed to murder another journalist and 100 Yemenis with impunity"??
9214 2018-11-21 16:24:12 Saudi Arabia has zero to do with the oil price dropping, .
9215 2018-11-21 16:24:12 First...oil prices haven’t been concluded since the year isn’t over. And at least we aren’t at Obama’s highest of $109.45.
9216 2018-11-21 16:24:10 How can this be SA’s doing when we are now the leader of oil supply doesn’t that mean that we dictate price now or wait is that the lie or this or...
9217 2018-11-21 16:24:06 Trump is a globalist. He supports terrrorists in Saudi ArabiA. Because of oil. Same old story
9218 2018-11-21 16:24:05 The US gets 40% of its oil from Canada. Only 11% from the Saudis. Trump once again proves he is a liar.
9219 2018-11-21 16:24:04 Canada provides 40% of your oil. Saudi 11%. And we don’t murder journalists
9220 2018-11-21 16:24:02 Isaiah 10:27 It shall come to pass in that day That his burden will be taken away from your shoulder, And his yoke from your neck, And the yoke will be destroyed because of the anointing oil.
9221 2018-11-21 16:24:00 And we get most of our oil from Canada anyway.
9222 2018-11-21 16:24:00 Oswin Benjamin- olive oil
9223 2018-11-21 16:23:59 Please direct us to the source what shows oil and gas companies getting subsidies. What you don't understand is even your Tesla only exists because of oil. Every single part of the car comes from oil.
9224 2018-11-21 16:23:56 I hate when they oil the streets
9225 2018-11-21 16:23:56 Not to worry, you guys are doing a great job especially in these days of too much noise you are the guiding light for us oil traders.
9226 2018-11-21 16:23:54 Yeah what Kazemi said. Maybe not heating it at all so perhaps a side of cbd oil salad (same with eggs , don't scramble them)

9231 2018-11-21 16:23:40 Low oil prices hurt the coal industry... careful... and low oil prices mean lower profits/GDP for the country that produces the MOST oil in the world, USA.  So I'm not sure where low oil prices are a good thing...

9234 2018-11-21 16:23:38 I think he's more measured than that. $ is the the mode of punishmen. He's punishing not just S.A. for the death but all OPEC. This is akin to making whole team run for error of 1 player. OPEC only cares abt $. This is a crippling move to their already dwindling influence on oil.
9235 2018-11-21 16:23:36 Easy now Mr President! Seems like hotel prices are pretty high! Maybe you could drop those prices 30%?  There are a lot of us in the oil industry that will be unemployed if you drop oil prices much lower. 100% of us are Trump fans! MAGA

Is this his way "Making America Great Again"?
Is that American values now?
With such friends, you don´t need enemies!
#Thanksgiving
9238 2018-11-21 16:23:29 There are many factors affecting oil prices but you praise the murderous Saudi regime. You know what's also going LOWER, the stock market and folks 401K's. #TrumpCrimeFamily
9239 2018-11-21 16:23:28 I bet you need an oil change too
9240 2018-11-21 16:23:22 Yes true Canada is your biggest supplier. But if Saudi did not help to reduce priced you would have been paying a much higher price to your Canadian partner. Yes Saudi Arabia helped in reducing your oil bill.
9241 2018-11-21 16:23:20 Slowly lowering it in hot boiling oil or shoving it in the oven like an old witch in a candy house
9242 2018-11-21 16:23:20 There isn't a liquidity problem ,despite the FED's contractionary monetary policy, and the  oil price could stay in a holding pattern as the speculators have burned by surplus supply . . Fiscal policy ???
9243 2018-11-21 16:23:19 You mean #MBS #MurdererBinSalman First or #israel first? What exactly do you mean mr. President? Oil first? Please explain. We the people of the United States of America, we do not deal with killers, nor do we cover up their crimes or else, we are the same.
9244 2018-11-21 16:23:17 Market manipulation has always been a concern. It is why we have strived for the independence of reliance on them. Why "fracking" has become a popular addition to energy manufacturing in US. True independence means alternative energy, solar, etc., independent of oil production.
9245 2018-11-21 16:23:15 yes! please take 4 grams of DHA daily.  You surely won't need to take your mineral oil as a laxative.   $AMRN
9246 2018-11-21 16:23:13 isn't oil down because people are expecting a global slow down in part because of our genius trade war with china???
9247 2018-11-21 16:23:09 SA doesn't set the price of oil and that $82 price he Tweeted is false in the first place.

There is nothing #traitor45 won't lie about.
9248 2018-11-21 16:23:06 When was oil 82?
9249 2018-11-21 16:23:03 Gaslighting again? Let's get real. It takes more than Saudi barrel prices to significantly affect cost at our pumps. We get less than 10% of our oil from the Saudis (around 8%).  We get more from Canada, or from Latin America. And about 40% is from right here, at home.
9250 2018-11-21 16:23:02 Seattle (WA) Times: Gunmen attack western Libya oil site, production unchanged
9251 2018-11-21 16:22:55 Have you tried a moisturizing oil? Almond oil is really good for dry skin. Put it on straight after cleansing your skin, your skin should then feel beautifull and smooth. It doesn't leave any shine either.
9252 2018-11-21 16:22:53 LOST your moral voice, past tense. It’s over already, Senator. You’ve made your choice to stand with the immoral President who justifies covering up a murder to protect an arms and oil deal.
9253 2018-11-21 16:22:51 Doubt PM’s response will include six exclamation  points and a defense of the Saudis as oil producers and UK job creators.
9254 2018-11-21 16:22:48 Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.  Yet you bow to the Saudis and dismiss what was previously your strongest Ally.
9255 2018-11-21 16:22:48 #TheView  Yesterday, today and tomorrow it is Trump First.  He will never put this country before his own financial interests. It’s not just about the U.S.’s oil.  He has his own business dealings he is protecting.  Wake up people! @ABC
9256 2018-11-21 16:22:45 Folks and government should be careful what they wish for. Declining oil prices & 10 yr treasury may signal slowing economy
9257 2018-11-21 16:22:45 Wow, someone should explain to the president how oil prices work. 
Or how Saudi Arabia does, aka weaponizes oil prices and destroys economies around the globe just 4 years ago, and more recently actually brutally murders someone just because.
9258 2018-11-21 16:22:45 Cool, so your on board with opening up all federal lands to drilling and fast tracking pipeline development from North Dakota? You want to punish the Saudi’s, you do it by driving oil down to $20 a barrel.
9259 2018-11-21 16:22:44 Bluto is tied up to an oil drum as it blows up. 

Popeye watches the explosion a la Django. 

Popeye takes a drag from his pipe and says, "ug. ug. ug. ug. ug."
9260 2018-11-21 16:22:41 Wow crazy. From no oil to all the oil in the world
9261 2018-11-21 16:22:40 The real cause of oil price drop is that there is too much oil on the market...lower demand. US is the largest oil producer in the world. Your conclusions are off as usual. Just cause you say it - it’s not true. Stop excusing SA’s deplorable behavior.
9262 2018-11-21 16:22:38 i bought a new shirt online the other day and got it in the mail so naturally i tried it on and wore it to bed... and OFCOURSE i woke up and there was an oil stain on the front of it from the rosemary oil i put my hair lol fml i cant have nice things
9263 2018-11-21 16:22:33 So, it's okay for them to kill American journalists as long as they give us cheap oil. Got it!
9264 2018-11-21 16:22:29 So that’s what it took to turn the other cheek to a murdered journalist.....

Oil prices..

Burn in hell
9265 2018-11-21 16:22:29 The only thing I disagree with is Hitch's use of young players, I feel like he actually uses them and is better for their development. IMO at least.
9266 2018-11-21 16:22:28 I think you’re honest, the Oilers haven’t done much to talk positively about in the last decade.
9267 2018-11-21 16:22:25 As if Americans will see a difference at the pump. Your big oil buddies will make even more money, while the rest of America gets f@cked at the pump. Time to move away from oil and embrace companies like @CarbonEngineer that suck CO2 from the atmosphere and make fuel from it.
9268 2018-11-21 16:22:24 Saudi Iran etc kill thousands yearly. That’s real issue. Trump is being real. Pick your battles wisely. I am sure most Americans are not ready to loose jobs and pay huge oil prices for Saudi internal battles. Issue is middle east is a mess and getting America deeper not needed.
9269 2018-11-21 16:22:20 Trump, you have sold your soul for cheap oil. Oh, and probably MORE Saudi money...
9270 2018-11-21 16:22:17 i went 10k miles without getting an oil change cos i thought my car would tell me... am i lucky my car didn’t blow up or nah? 
9271 2018-11-21 16:22:10 i don’t know how i ever survived without cbd oil.
9272 2018-11-21 16:22:08 So are we to accept Erdogan's word as gospel? I say consider the source. Did he show "tape" of evidence?..if so, let us all hear. We can not take a moral high ground Not after our war for oil/poppy/daesh? SA citizen- just bc hes a beacon for left does not warrant a crisis
9273 2018-11-21 16:22:07 @CadburyUK  Just read your tweets to previous ppl concerned about your use of palm oil; your stated actions too slow & total disregard of environment. Spoken with family /friends & all now boycotting your products.
9274 2018-11-21 16:22:05 And the cheaper oil is a sham concept
9275 2018-11-21 16:22:04 Oil @MauricioMacri, the $54 82 Area Fence Juan
9276 2018-11-21 16:22:03 Blood for oil 
9277 2018-11-21 16:22:03 SA doesn't set the price of oil.
9278 2018-11-21 16:21:56 By my calculations, Justin Trudeau could murder 3 1/2 journalists for the amount of oil we get from Canada.
9279 2018-11-21 16:21:55 And for edification as well as clarification purposes, the US imports about 40% of their oil from Canada whereas they only import about 11% from Saudi Arabia. Those are facts and not "fake" news...
9280 2018-11-21 16:21:55 Thanks, Saudia Arabia? Right. Oil was in the 30s and 40s under Obama. Maybe they liked him better.
9281 2018-11-21 16:21:53 Similarly, the ability of the oil patch to pay ridiculous amounts for things during boom times also drives up the material costs, and when the inevitable bust happens, those costs only come down partially. /4
9282 2018-11-21 16:21:53 I looked up the percent too, and the latest percent I found was only 9% from Saudi. Our biggest import of crude oil was 40% from Canada.
9283 2018-11-21 16:21:52 Literal blood spilled for lower gas prices (& don't even know if the murder acceptance by #Trump, contrary to our intelligence experts, "helped" lower prices). Rather pay more for oil/gas than have USA be ok w/ torture, murder, and dismemberment. 
#Khashoggi #SaudiArabiaFirst
9284 2018-11-21 16:21:51 Must have been that tax cut he was talking about. He really sucks at business.  only gets 11% of its oil from 
9285 2018-11-21 16:21:49 Not only Saudi that has and sales oil Mr Dumb President#BloodMoney
9286 2018-11-21 16:21:49 Then Trump asking are there any more low life's you need to murderer or have disappear so we can keep oil prices low?
9287 2018-11-21 16:21:48 Sinceramente, con el nuevo fair, upair y buen oil panic, le hará subir una tier por lo menos

9289 2018-11-21 16:21:45 And Canada provides 40 % Of your imported oil compared to 11% from Saudi Arabia!
9290 2018-11-21 16:21:45 We are on our way to independence.  The US is the leading oil producer in the world,  due to technology.  And we are inching forward on green energy and reducing energy  consumption.
9291 2018-11-21 16:21:44 Unless you're an American resident, working at an American company & MbS orders your torture & slaughter for reporting on a murderous Saudi regime. Sorry residents of USA u are not as important as oil & $ & trump's personal profit. You're disgusting. #KhashoggiMurder
9292 2018-11-21 16:21:43 Also the same country that is signing new lucrative gas and oil deals with russia?? Where’s the leadership there? Oh wait, that’s right...CNN...should have known
9293 2018-11-21 16:21:39 Oil prices go up and down all the time. Trump did nothing special.
9294 2018-11-21 16:21:39 Trump makes it sound as if the Saudis are responsible for falling oil prices. In reality, what's driving them down is increased production and fear that the global economy is slowing.
9295 2018-11-21 16:21:37 Sir, you are an idiot. Oil prices are dropping because a) investors expect demand to drop as a result of a slowing economy, and b) increased US shale oil production which is the result of policies put in place before your term started.
9296 2018-11-21 16:21:34 This will only work till they have oil.
9297 2018-11-21 16:21:33 *Oilers'

9299 2018-11-21 16:21:29 Wow... That journalist that was brutally murdered, is pretty much what gave us lower oil prices..... Wow.... Horrible. Dirty. Disgusting.

9302 2018-11-21 16:21:18 I am here, was in an office Thanksgiving breakfast stuffing my face.

God, in his infinite fairness, ensured that my beard did not connect so all the beard oil ain't doing shingbain for me.
9303 2018-11-21 16:21:17 Wait a minute....I thought we didn't need oil from the mid East. I see what a life is worth.
9304 2018-11-21 16:21:15 I demanded more hours at the coal mine so I could buy crude oil from the saudis and dump it in my city's water supply
9305 2018-11-21 16:21:14 Funny how gas prices go up before a holiday...unless $$$ and Saudi Arabian oil are involved.   The US military is the biggest contibuter to green house gases in the world.   We're #1, but this should not be a source of national pride!
9306 2018-11-21 16:21:12 You condon premeditated first degree murder and for that you get lower oil prices?  Is this like I can kill someone on 5th Avenue and no one would care?  You are horrible.
9307 2018-11-21 16:21:11 Nutella is about a 3rd Palm Oil.
9308 2018-11-21 16:21:11 Also I’m not distorting anything. I can see the prices have gone up since trump took office. However the only on distorting facts is you by acting like Obama’s oil prices were extremely high 2011-2014. Last thing...2018 numbers are preliminary since 2018 hasn’t concluded
9309 2018-11-21 16:21:08 Like Oil
9310 2018-11-21 16:21:06 I thought you were going to make the US energy independent? Instead you’ve chosen to trade lives for foreign oil . I assume you’ll consider this another promise kept though.
9311 2018-11-21 16:21:03 6 - In the end, status quo, which is the apparent suggestion here, does nothing to improve the cost at the pump, reduce our foreign imports, improve air quality, stop our military from protecting supply lines for oil, or reduce the gov't support for oil. All important to many.
9312 2018-11-21 16:21:01 How much of that Saudi oil money will end up in the pockets of terrorists and Trump's pockets?

9315 2018-11-21 16:20:53 Terrestrial solar is unsustainable without an oil based industrial infrastructure to support it.
9316 2018-11-21 16:20:52 Thinking critically and identifying deficiencies with data because you want your favorite sports team to be the best it can be is not "being negative". I'm not sure why so many people find that concept difficult to grasp.
9317 2018-11-21 16:20:51 It's only cheaper oil, not global economic slowdown!
9318 2018-11-21 16:20:49 Is this the oil mate?
9319 2018-11-21 16:20:48 What Trump is missing is that expensive oil is in the US’s long term interest.

High price makes shale profitable, which massively benefits US production.

It also makes renewables competitive, driving innovation and development there, and you know, saving the planet.
9320 2018-11-21 16:20:46 You mean we will divide
Also oil will never finish just as coal has not finished
Gas boku
9321 2018-11-21 16:20:45 Why do you believe US activists more than Alberta energy specialists? The tripling of the Kinder Morgan pipeline is not needed because oil sands are less economic than oil shales.
9322 2018-11-21 16:20:45 Two weeks down for this trip offshore, one week to go. On proper countdown mode now.

Unfortunately, it’s looking highly likely at this point that I’ll be on an oil rig for Christmas which sucks all the balls. Nature of the beast I guess.
9323 2018-11-21 16:20:44 Putin is also allowed now kill any journalist or opponent anywhere as long as keep oil prices low and supply Europe with gas at low prices.
9324 2018-11-21 16:20:43 Shhh!!! He might remember the US shale fields and want a higher price for oil... We don't want the US to make smart decisions!
9325 2018-11-21 16:20:43 So what I hear is you would rather create trade sanctions with Saudi Arabia (your main source of oil) then have little to no oil and never get to work in the morning? Losing millions of dollars in arms sales to Saudi Arabia? Hes doing what’s best for the US. Use common sense.
9326 2018-11-21 16:20:42 The US gets 40% of its oil from Canada, and only 11% from Saudi Arabia. So his reasoning is a __ __ __(fill in the blanks.)
9327 2018-11-21 16:20:42 WTF is right...really? How the heck does that happen? All the Oil companies must be attracted to your lawn stripesyou can make stuff up like this...
9328 2018-11-21 16:20:39 Have you got any clue of:
1. Where the oil used in the US comes from?
2. How the oil price is set?
3. How much it hurts to be tortured to death?
9329 2018-11-21 16:20:34 Thank you for reminding the world of Canada's oil contribution.  Perhaps peace might be within the US' grasp if the NRA were to lose its grip not just Saudi Arabia's control of DT. Domestic violence and paranoia are thriving.@JoyBehar
9330 2018-11-21 16:20:33 History suggests trying to forecast and control #oil prices is a mug's game. Then again, Citrus Don's a mug.
9331 2018-11-21 16:20:30 The sweetest laughs I wish to you all the happiness...and for Thanksgiving, I'm thankful for you and for my family
Have you ever tried heating up a bit of olive oil so it's warm to the touch and massage it into your skin where your muscles hurt?
I LOVE YOU
9332 2018-11-21 16:20:29 It's amazing watching idiots basically demand we go to war, and destroy oil prices over something that happens quite often globally...
9333 2018-11-21 16:20:26 The boom-bust oil industry tends to pay stupidly high salaries during boom times, and that has pushed up the overall salary expectations in Alberta - considerably above what is normative in most of BC (outside the lower mainland) /3
9334 2018-11-21 16:20:24 Funny cause oil and nearly everything else is going up while the market has lost all its yearly gains. 

Is confidence really that high? Or is it just Donald?
9335 2018-11-21 16:20:24 I grew up in Louisiana where the oil industry is a large part of the economy. Lower oil prices aren’t good there & historically leads to higher unemployment for men & women working offshore. Cheaper gas, but no $ to buy it.
9336 2018-11-21 16:20:22 If it continues, I assure you, it WILL hurt the effort to get property tax relief this next session- AND it will cost a lot of oil workers their jobs.
9337 2018-11-21 16:20:21 Enforcement of the precondition would have to be independent not via the companies involved.. As for being insolvent.. Not so... One particular oil major made 1st qtr profit of approx 60 billion
9338 2018-11-21 16:20:21 Ya know and like 15/19 of the hijackers from 9/11 were from Saudi Arabia but it’s fine bc we get oil from them. Also Muslims are bad because of 9/11 too but not necessarily those from Saudi  bc ya know, oil and money
9339 2018-11-21 16:20:20 /rlt/ Apakah ada yang mau membeli cleansing oil eminaku? Bagus bgt kok, cuma aku emang gacocok pake yg oil based huhu:( Baru dipake 3x sisa 95%, dom surabaya 28k aja. Ku belinya 60-an. Ntar ku DM
9340 2018-11-21 16:20:17 It's CANADA that supplies more oil and natural gas to the US, NOT Saudi Arabia. By Siding with Saudi Arabia who just murdered and butchered an American Journalist, Trump has committed  TREASON.  Now contact the Senate to order his immediate removal. #IMPEACH45
9341 2018-11-21 16:20:16 *At Thanksgiving dinner*

My brain:
Don’t say it. 
Don’t say it. 
Don’t say it. 
Don’t say it. 
Don’t say it.

Me: "So the whole paper straw campaign HAS to be being pushed by companies like big oil & etc in order to distract us from them and shift blame to the consumer, right??"
9342 2018-11-21 16:20:14 My water is mixed with olive oil....my daily spritzer for Liquid, followed by Oil and then Hair butter/ moisturizer 
9343 2018-11-21 16:20:12 Bill Gates changed the World, Oprah changed the World, Steve Jobs changed the world & many more people who are Billionaires abroad changed the world but here, it's about who I know, who gives me Oil bloc. M.I  #10YearsALearner
9344 2018-11-21 16:20:11 Buy electric cars. The combustion engine is becoming a dinosaur just like the oil they guzzle.
9345 2018-11-21 16:20:08 Fox fake  News should stop hiring  people that don't know anything about oil Futures and margin calls.

Stu you should take some courses or maybe watch Mad Money Jim Cramer explain it to you so even a child with your mentality can understand it
9346 2018-11-21 16:20:08 I'd gladly pay a dollar more at the pumps knowing we weren't getting our oil from a country that kidnaps, tortures & murders US residents.

Just when we think you can go no lower (Veteran's Day & our military), you find a disgusting way to go lower.

#Trumpisworstpresidentever
9347 2018-11-21 16:20:02 You know who should be thanked for low oil prices? Electric car owners and manufacturers, solar power and wind providers and users, and others who lower the demand for oil and cause prices to drop.
9348 2018-11-21 16:20:01 Better respect the Trinis...if anything they Vincy...MAWD ppl...I'd say Grenadian but there's no oil lol
9349 2018-11-21 16:20:00 Oil prices are dropping because the stock market is taking a nose dive, not because of Baby Trump's ignorant and asinine trade policies. But no doubt a good bit of that Saudi oil money will end up in Baby Trump's pockets.
9350 2018-11-21 16:20:00 Oil prices haven’t “just been $82.”  It hadn’t been over $80. since 2014.  Were being lied to again.
9351 2018-11-21 16:20:00 Lets not forget how much easier it is to deal with the Trump EPA, Trump FERC for pipelines, Trump State Department to cross borders for pipelines, Trump Coast Guard to build and work offshore...I wouldn't overstate the Trump hurts oil too much.
9352 2018-11-21 16:20:00 I’m more partial to preparing it Persian style kebab, let it age (if you can), leave it in fridge chopped in kebab size bits with tons of red onions (chopped finely) and fresh ground black pepper, maybe add unfiltered cold pressed olive oil, let it sit for 2 to 3 days. No salt /2
9353 2018-11-21 16:19:58 Glen would step outside his bubble but I'm sure it contributes to climate change. So I'll fill you in - write-downs of downtown Calgary real estate is wiping out portfolios. DT office vacancy rate 35%. Oil being pumped at a loss. You think Albertans share that vision of Canada?
9354 2018-11-21 16:19:57 You do realize that low gas prices means layoffs in the states where oil is a big employer!
9355 2018-11-21 16:19:52 Hey stupid, maybe you should have read last weeks Wall Street journal.  It is speculators who are afraid the economy is going to cool down are what’s driving lower oil prices. Don’t you have someone to explain this stuff to you?
9356 2018-11-21 16:19:51 Since when does the price per barrel reflect the price at the pump?  Sure the oil companies pay less but they most definitely do not pass on that savings to customers.  But you have likely never payed for or pumped your own gas so you wouldn't know
9357 2018-11-21 16:19:49 @TheView Trump is a #LIAR.  #SaudiArabia alone does not determine the price nor supply of oil.Ever heard of OPEC: Algeria,Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigria, Qatar, UAE, Venezuela & Saudi Arabia. Trump is giving a pass 2 a #murderer.
9358 2018-11-21 16:19:48 I told my husband yesterday the Saudis were manipulating us w/ these low prices! Trying to get into our good graces by lowering the price of oil! B/c it sure is strange- a holiday week and the prices are down. that never happens! they gouge us during holiday travel!
9359 2018-11-21 16:19:47 You could use some balance in your comments. I have not seen too much that is off base from you
9360 2018-11-21 16:19:45 The price of oil has even less to do with it than Saudi has to do with the price of oil.
9361 2018-11-21 16:19:43 Hey stable genius, do you know the break even point for North Dakota oil production? Any clue how going lower could affect those workers? Thought not.
9362 2018-11-21 16:19:36 Hey, Dip-shit.  Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia. You are welcome.
9363 2018-11-21 16:19:36 I guess decapitating or dismembering isn’t such a horrible practice as long as we get cheaper oil.
9364 2018-11-21 16:19:30 That's a little wordy for a service station sign, but sheesh is that what it takes? "No murdered journalist ties pumps!" I'd pay more for it. No Saudi Arabia oil.
9365 2018-11-21 16:19:28 Got a discount off the oil change and I got a number next time it need to be free
9366 2018-11-21 16:19:26 Sorry, but more of your oil comes from Canada. You're welcome.
9367 2018-11-21 16:19:26 You're correct.  Still, doesn't the fall in price of oil make the heinous murder of Khashoggi so much more palatable?
9368 2018-11-21 16:19:24 You’re a sick man! Doesn’t your Country produce a lot of oil, and FFS, why should the price of oil allow you to abandon Human Rights! MBS must have something on you, as no other President if your Country would abandon your Country’s morals, and values! Disgusting!
9369 2018-11-21 16:19:19 I still think that somehow 97 and 29 need to drive their own lines if the Oil want to have any long term success.
9370 2018-11-21 16:19:19 Due to fracking of shale oil the U.S. is the #1 oil producer in the world.
9371 2018-11-21 16:19:18 Trump’s America First means an exaggerated arms deal and small amount of oil have replaced our moral integrity. To doubt the findings of the CIA gives license to nations to be bad actors w/out US condemnation
9372 2018-11-21 16:19:14 Thanks for this. I usually buy @marksandspencer “all butter” ones...turns out on closer inspection that the vegetable suet contains palm oil! 
So it’s Iceland all the way now
9373 2018-11-21 16:19:13 Trump shows a Stern sign of winning by no sanctions to Saudis. The Saudis in return keep production of oil up and understand the redline in the sand.  The killing of reporter was a bad political move by Saudis .  America what's to PC this act in return hurt American economy.
9374 2018-11-21 16:19:13 The steam room at Lifetime (Beachwood) is the shit. And they had the peppermint oil infusion today. Perfect for meditation.

My new stop after yoga.

9375 2018-11-21 16:19:13 The place I usually get my oil changes includes rotating tires in the job.
9376 2018-11-21 16:19:09 Now its bad mood today. thx. WTF on all levels. At least we know who donates to your pac. Did you know every single O&G Co in Canada is responsibly-sourced? With the highest enviro regulations on the planet. The entire World wants Cdn Oil & Gas - just not our own Gov.
9377 2018-11-21 16:19:03 Hypocrite, when are you and your other silly Ministers going to allow responsibility produced Canadian Oul be shipped across Canada so we don't have to rely on Saudi Oil? Shut up until you do something real!

9379 2018-11-21 16:18:57 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
9380 2018-11-21 16:18:53 I’ll never forget the time I went in to get my check engine light diagnosed  and the man told me he wasn’t sure if I needed a $40 oil change or $3781 worth of work to fix the issue.

Chose the oil change and been driving the car fine since.
9381 2018-11-21 16:18:52 of course, $54 a bbl oil = layoffs in the USA... but hey, who cares as long as he gets his, right?
9382 2018-11-21 16:18:51 A bit misleading because it’s not Saudi imports driving down oil, it’s OPEC production. But Saudi more or less controls OPEC and they follow its lead.
9383 2018-11-21 16:18:50 Tea tree oil is amazing. I treat overnight with grease lighting from lush !!
9384 2018-11-21 16:18:47 I'm Oil Can Harry! And I'm AND THEIR DOG!
9385 2018-11-21 16:18:42 So what I hear is you would rather create trade sanctions with Saudi Arabia (your main source of oil) then have little to no oil and never get to work in the morning? Losing millions of dollars in arms sales to Saudi Arabia? Hes doing what’s best for the US. Use common sense.
9386 2018-11-21 16:18:41 You are an oil producer.
9387 2018-11-21 16:18:40 hmmm... oil prices getting lower because Saudia Arabia is buying their own "JUSTICE"!! #KhashoggiMurder @StephenAtHome @colbertlateshow @FoxNews @ABCWorldNews     ...BE BEST!
9388 2018-11-21 16:18:38 Oil for murder. You are quite the negotiator
9389 2018-11-21 16:18:36 You Sold us Out- TO LINE YOUR POCKETS
WE GET 40% OF OUR OIL FROM CANADA- You shit on CANADA. I GET ALONG WITH SAUDI GREAT. BUY MY APARTMENTS. 40-50 M. Am I suppose to dislike them.I get along with them Great. Asana Bin- Ladin Brother Lived in Trump Tower. DONT ACT LIKE OBAMAS BAD
9390 2018-11-21 16:18:33 ลุงงงงงงงงงงง
9391 2018-11-21 16:18:30 Trump makes it sound as if the Saudis are responsible for falling oil prices. In reality, what's driving them down is increased production and fear that the global economy is slowing.
9392 2018-11-21 16:18:29 What war? Magninsky Act the lot of them. They don't have an army to attck us. USA is second largest oil producer. Return law so oil is only sold in US. They learn to live in a civilized world
9393 2018-11-21 16:18:29 Oil should be inexpensive, like it was during booming Eighties and Nineties, to help consumers and businesses to afford it and spend more on other goods and services.
9394 2018-11-21 16:18:28 @JACM0313 @POTUS Asides from lying about the high price if oil, you're not doing anything about the murderer, Prince Salman. It has been determined that he approved the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. You're acting more like a PR firm for this killer. Even some GOP'rs agree!
Shithole!
9395 2018-11-21 16:18:28 Also,since the USA is now the world's largest oil producer,how do lower oil prices benefit us? It is in fact a double negative.
9396 2018-11-21 16:18:26 Dr Bhatt said chances of Reduce results (CV Death, MI, Stroke reduction) being erroneous are 6 out 10,000,000 (10 Million) . Which makes Matt obession with Mineral Oil more about needing a laxative than providing scientific insights of any value.  $AMRN
9397 2018-11-21 16:18:23 gasoline has stayed cheap in red states this whole time despite the rise in oil prices and the impact per household/month is minimal.  would be happy to hear if you disagree?
9398 2018-11-21 16:18:20 Saudis will going to cut oil production and jack up the prices.
9399 2018-11-21 16:18:16 While Trump may be correct about oil prices, is it right for America to take a blind eye to the murder of a US resident just so our gas prices will not go up? Do we find a way to justify his murder so we can sleep at night? How far do we let this go before we say enough?
9400 2018-11-21 16:18:15 hey, @realDonaldTrump, you know who doesn't get to benefit from low oil prices? jamal khashoggi. You're a shameful and weak man.
9401 2018-11-21 16:18:11 Your lens is tainted on this.  I've been following oil industry numbers for a while and knew there was no reasoned explanation for recent gas price increases.  It's all a mighty sh*t-show.
9402 2018-11-21 16:18:09 Americans had had enough of the basic transformation of our country by a little-known snake oil salesmen from Illinois. This is why Her Highness is not president. We needed a major course correction and only an unconventional guy like Donald J. Trump could make that happen. 
9403 2018-11-21 16:18:09 Looks like he might eat that @Oreo once the dirty palm oil is dropped #DropDirtyPalmOil
9404 2018-11-21 16:17:58 We only get 5-10% of our oil from Saudi Arabia and 40% from Canada so how are you putting America first.  This is all about the money you and your family have received and continue to receive from Saudi Arabia. I guess Canada didn’t give you money! Traitor!
9405 2018-11-21 16:17:55 Had oil change on Fri. On the way to Indiana that night, I realized while getting fuel I was losing oil. Oil filter was not screwed in. Lost 4+ quarts. I don't think it's too much to ask for husband's mileage to come up and figure out what was wrong? Tow would have been more.
9406 2018-11-21 16:17:54 We are the largest oil producing country in the world, why are you thanking them?
9407 2018-11-21 16:17:46 Motor Oil
9408 2018-11-21 16:17:42 There are NO long term studies on the effects of taking puberty blockers young, then hormones, then sex reassignment surgery. None. 
There is no evidence that it helps, long term, or that the huge list of possible side effects is worth it. 
Transition is snake oil.
9409 2018-11-21 16:17:39 I really don’t feel like going to get my oil changed. 
9410 2018-11-21 16:17:35 Canada could fill in oil shortage if Saudi cuts theirs. Oh we’re the country President hates but loves Saudi because? How much does he owe them
9411 2018-11-21 16:17:34 Saudi sets oil prices based on market factors they want to control in order to maximize income from a vanishing asset.   Not because MBS thinks Trump is pretty.
9412 2018-11-21 16:17:33 Ryan you’re not focusing on the true objective of the President. Your blinded by hate. To the point that all you think about is looking for unimportant details to call the President a liar. The objective is to keep oil prices down, which’s is what the President is doing.
9413 2018-11-21 16:17:33 Why do I think you are tweeting this to make us forget about the murder sanctioned by the Saudi crown prince? And, you know a little thing called supply and demand....cheap oil from mid-east sucks for US domestic oil industry workers so more like a pink slip than a tax cut.
9414 2018-11-21 16:17:29 If you know anything about the oil  market and large institutions buying on margin....

You should tell the public large institutions bought on margin oil Futures and they guessed wrong.....now they have to sell good  stocks to pay for their margin calls.

This is happened before
9415 2018-11-21 16:17:28 Oh donnie we can't watch you go lower.  Take your love of Saudi's and oil prices and stick it up your -ss.
9416 2018-11-21 16:17:28 Tell that to oil production workers.
9417 2018-11-21 16:17:25 It really bugs me when people say naturopaths are all about SoulCycle and spirulina. We're not that simple. We also like oil pulling.
9418 2018-11-21 16:17:25 Other oil producing countries will note that the POTUS has set the price. The cost of a journalist's life: $28 a barrel.
9419 2018-11-21 16:17:25 I’ll have to pick some up today. Was thinking maybe oil (coconut/olive) would help? Probably should’ve done that before the shower. Lol
9420 2018-11-21 16:17:24 Canada supplies 40%, of US imported oil. Saudi Arabia 11%.
9421 2018-11-21 16:17:22 Openly negotiating with his Saudi friends to manipulate public opinion then shoving it in our faces as if we didn’t already know why the cost of oil has been creeping down! Buying us off by throwing pennies at us?!Why is this Traitor not in prison?!!
9422 2018-11-21 16:17:19 Because I'm on keto for epilepsy, I have very high fat macros and moderate protein macros. Vegetables make a nice substrate for fat (butter, cheese, olive oil) which is a reason I eat so many olives.
9423 2018-11-21 16:17:16 Yes mixtures change by climate....but still your statement that "oil prices always get lower this time of year" is false.
9424 2018-11-21 16:17:10 I hate shake shack fries . There no potato in it bro . Just oil and crunch. Gives me a headache every time
9425 2018-11-21 16:17:06 Excuse me. I was protesting US hegemonism in Vietnam before you were born and Iraq months before the war began and I'm still working on Iran and Palestinians. I'm also against KSA oil blood domination of my country. I don't want any more US aid to go to MBS to murder Yemenis.
9426 2018-11-21 16:17:03 Tiny bumps tu x semestinya sebab oil, boleh jd sebab ingredient dlm cleansing oil tu sendiri, cth mcm mineral oil atau alcohol. Dua2 ni ada potensi utk irritate skin lg2 yg kulit sensitif.
9427 2018-11-21 16:17:02 He forgets to mention that low oil prices will also put american oil workers and the businesses that support them out of work when it's no longer profitable to run the wells.
9428 2018-11-21 16:16:57 No new punishments for Saudi Arabia which is interesting because if this all happened in Iran then Trump would be laying down the oil drenched gauntlet.

If oil were free, it doesn't change the fact the Saudis killed, in an horrific manner, a Washington Post journalist, a father, a friend, a fiance. 

Life is not about $$$.
9435 2018-11-21 16:16:42 We get 40% of our imported oil from Canada. 11% of an oil price drop is not worth a life. No one is safe. Any autocratic regime is free to kill wherever and whomever they want to.

Told baby mama he would send for her soon.
Dude changed mind & told bm he didn't want her no more.
Dude came back home ...

OH. and she took his car & left the state.

9442 2018-11-21 16:16:32 How about thanking Canada? We get 40% of our oil from them (vs 11% from SA).
9443 2018-11-21 16:16:30 I thought my hair was the same until my hair dresser told me that oil is giving me dry scalp and so I just stopped using it after that all together n my shit grew, got thicker, don’t itch or nun
9444 2018-11-21 16:16:30 No worries if oil price sky rockets.. we can deal with it as long as we keep kicking trump in the ass

9449 2018-11-21 16:16:20 Thank Justin.  40% of US oil comes from Canada.  10% from Saudi Arabia.
9450 2018-11-21 16:16:20 We get most of our oil imports from Canada dummy. Like 40%, Saudi is like only 10%.  So thank you to Canada I guess.

9452 2018-11-21 16:16:14 Amanda Lang thank you for speed talking the horrific situation Canada is in with our oil discount impacting every aspect of Canadian life.
9453 2018-11-21 16:16:14 Here’s the real news idiot.
1)Saudi Arabia doesn’t set oil prices but it has a major influence on it.
2)doesn’t matter how much the US produces.  It is a global market and prices are based on GLOBAL supply and demand.
3) bullshit
4)I personally don’t give a shit about kashoogi
9454 2018-11-21 16:16:12 Oil bounced above $63 a barrel on Wednesday to claw back some of  the previous day's 6 percent plunge, lifted by a report of an unexpected  decline in U.S. crude inventories.
9455 2018-11-21 16:16:06 Because Canada supplies 40% of oil to America. They appear to have their shit together. As opposed to Saudis 11 and Mexico’s 0
9456 2018-11-21 16:16:05 Idiots.  Oil is priced n a global market.
9457 2018-11-21 16:16:05 Canada actually supplies the most oil and natural gas to the US, not Saudi Arabia. And of course Trump is kissing their ass which means he has committed TREASON.

9459 2018-11-21 16:15:58 Does Trump even realize that Canada exports to the US almost 4x the oil that Saudi Arabia does? He is selling America’s soul and the returns are pretty low... but I guess you get what you pay for.  Be better America.
9460 2018-11-21 16:15:55 You know nothing about business and economics do you? There are world economic forces at play. Only you can try to spin accepting murder into low oil prices. A special place in hell awaits you.
9461 2018-11-21 16:15:55 And only 9% of our crude oil import comes from Saudi, 40% of the import comes from Canada
9462 2018-11-21 16:15:55 Not that great Sir. Could put us that work in the oilfield out of a job again. We need to keep the oil at $60-65 a barrel
9463 2018-11-21 16:15:54 3 - "The share of oil the U.S. imports has fallen in recent years..." While accurate, disingenuous at best. Foreign imports of petroleum typically are still above 40%. Our increased oil production has mostly just been exported thx to export ban.

murderous saudis   11%

and Canada is the threat to your national security???

9483 2018-11-21 16:15:09 Sorry more like an average of $80.56 during Obamas term. In fact if you look at the entire data Obama had THE HIGHEST prices on oil ever since 1960
9484 2018-11-21 16:15:05 Lie. Fact: Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
9485 2018-11-21 16:15:04 FWIW...Low oil prices are bad for many American companies

9489 2018-11-21 16:15:01 My car's computer prompting me to get an annual oil change made me realize how much less driving I have done in Boulder compared to L.A.

Past year in Boulder: 8,000 miles/year

Should be even less next year with more bike commuting.

9492 2018-11-21 16:14:54 But what do we use instead as other oil crops are far more land hungry.
9493 2018-11-21 16:14:53 Idk why I hate getting an oil change so much, but I do.
9494 2018-11-21 16:14:47 @JoLeversuch We're so excited that you're using our Lavender Essential Oil - just out of interest: what do you use it for? We would love to send you more and some others to try... 
9495 2018-11-21 16:14:46 Gas prices aren’t particularly low, OIL prices are. Somebody’s making out here but it isn’t the consumer.
9496 2018-11-21 16:14:44 Permian can pump some oil at $30 /barrel, but what about EF and Bakken?  EF + B production currently about equal to the Permian.

Rig counts were already way down in EF/B at $70 oil.  And if shale isn't drilling new holes, they aren't maintaining production
9497 2018-11-21 16:14:40 I know!!!! We need to utilize NORTH AMERICA  OIL NOW!!!! Industry in  trouble!
9498 2018-11-21 16:14:40 You forgot, "oh! and as a bonus we are going to lower the price of oil. no one will notice the suspicious timing."
9499 2018-11-21 16:14:39 STUPID STUPID man, Saudi Arabia had nothing to do with lower oil process. There is a glut of inventory. You must have flunked Econ 101 where the discussion on supply and demand was taught. Really you are a dimwit on economy. What’s next who is to blame for the markets decline???
9500 2018-11-21 16:14:32 US Oil needs 60, Saudis lower. Who is he supporting?
In any case, we should let economy play out and not meddle.

9503 2018-11-21 16:14:27 Yes, agree that the fall in #oil prices has to do with the slowdown in the global economy. Nevertheless it will be interesting to see what happens to the expected production cuts of up to 1 million barrels a day.

Also the fall in oil prices is not good news for the shale oil...
9504 2018-11-21 16:14:26 Canada could stop buying Saudi oil
9505 2018-11-21 16:14:23 Funny it's us here in America making prices go down since we are pumping more oil into the market I guess the president didn't get the memo...of wait of course he didn't since he doesn't read...it's sad and disgraceful
9506 2018-11-21 16:14:21 What trump is pertaining to is the sudden drop of world oil prices now since mid october of this year.the whole year of 2018 oil prices is steadily gaining upward because of opec holding supplies and tankers and cutting production..but now its gwtting lower again..learn news pls
9507 2018-11-21 16:14:20 You’re THANKING Saudi Arabia for lower oil prices?  

You PRAISE SA for murdering & dismembering Khashoggi 
in exchange for LOWER PRICE OF OIL? 

Do you even comprehend HUMAN RIGHTS? 

You’re a disgrace to America & humanity 
& a small, weak, disrespected, corrupt man.#Resign
9508 2018-11-21 16:14:14 We can 100% still trade with Saudia Arabia without pretending they are amazing and the best and thanking them for oil prices...... 

We can trade without Saudia Arabia while sanctioning them.

But trump only knows how to make deals by sucking the dick of whoever hes buying from

9521 2018-11-21 16:13:42 @realDonaldTrump  HOW ABOUT THANKING CANADA  WHO WE RECEIVE 40%  OF OUR OIL FROM INSTEAD OF SAUDI ARABIA, ONLY 11%.
9522 2018-11-21 16:13:40 IMO it's also fascinating that CNY bears are completely ignoring the CNY oil angle & its implications for China's BoP.  If CNY oil was not working, I suspect we'd be hearing about its failure from the tree tops...yet as I checked yesterday, Dec CNY contract OI = 42m bbls
9523 2018-11-21 16:13:39 The tragic and horrific #KashoggiMurder has highlighted another reason why we need extremely aggressive US green tech investment: Energy independence.

9529 2018-11-21 16:13:33 Of course you didn't hear, Putin "whispered" in her ear one day and said:

" Hey girl, I have to tell you a big secret, all these years I've been just acting that I like higher oil prices, but in reality I really really hate it, ponimayo???"
9530 2018-11-21 16:13:31 And we get only 9% of our crude oil from Saudi. 40% of it comes from Canada
9531 2018-11-21 16:13:30 All you had to do to get lower oil prices was overlook a murder ordered by the crown prince.
9532 2018-11-21 16:13:30 40% of our oil from Canada, 9% from SA. Yet, we're mad at Canada. It's a head-scratcher for sure.
9533 2018-11-21 16:13:23 Here's a BETTER idea—why don't we invest in clean energy?  And then the cost of oil will be ZERO, because we don't have to purchase ANY from your Saudi Arabian buddies.

Happy Thanksgiving—I hope your turkey comes with a few indictments stuffed up its ass.
9534 2018-11-21 16:13:21 @realDonaldTrump more jobs than people? Oil at 54 a barrel? Black unemployment lowest ever? Wages reaching new levels? Climate Deniers? I say critics are #trumpdeniers !!!   #KAGA and #HappyThanksgiving !! Thank You!!

9537 2018-11-21 16:13:12 He has blamed the democrats already. 
I hope everyone else can translate this problem too.  Lower oil prices destroys oil companies, which evidently destroys the entire stock market, which leads to lay offs and eventually recession.
9538 2018-11-21 16:13:10 Well unless y'all are talking about NUKING the FILTHY HEATHENS you are wasting our time.

They don't have to be there to get the OIL.

9539 2018-11-21 16:13:09 It’s unfathomable to me a country so rich in oil resources is plagued by poverty of its’ own citizens. Not educated in Middle Eastern politics but it appears direct US intervention isn’t a reasonable solution (e.g., Iraq) but rather requires other ME countries support. Thoughts?
9540 2018-11-21 16:13:09 We do time cycles on 200 + equities, indices, commodities, currencies - so we are broad, yes. We have a core focus to OIL, GOLD, SILVER, SPY, VIX, DXY, CRYPTO, and 200 + Swing equities we follow.
9541 2018-11-21 16:13:08 The point- when the market senses that, oil tends to go down. Thus, not Saudi Arabia “helping” (as he claimed) or anything he did to effect it but the reactionary effect in the oil markets to economic outlook as the stocks enter a bear market.
9542 2018-11-21 16:13:01 Hey stupid, did you forget that we are a leading producer of oil now?  At those prices American companies and Americans will be out of business, fracking is more costly.
9543 2018-11-21 16:13:01 @MST3K Dear Kinga: We're sure you can't wait for #MST3KTheGauntlet tomorrow. 
Suggestion: maybe #Trump can be the test case after he thanks the Saudis for cutting the price of oil just after he decides #MBS isn't guilty of murder.
C'mon, he deserves #MacandMe, right?

9547 2018-11-21 16:12:56 Keep telling that to make yourself feel better. Newsflash, iran wanted to become a democracy in the 40s and its leader was democractically elected and wanted to nationalize oil so iran could prosper

9551 2018-11-21 16:12:43 Point I was making is, doesn't matter who is POTUS, they will all bow down to SA just as most of the rest of the world does. US has come a long way to reduce its dependence on middle East oil, but still a bit more to go

9556 2018-11-21 16:12:24 @realDonaldTrump While @realDonaldTrump is happy to see oil prices dropping because it means more money in people pockets, the socialist European governments also rejoice because they can raise tax gasoline. Why are they surprised that the #YellowVests revolt in France?

9558 2018-11-21 16:12:18 How would Mossad benefit? Seriously??  America has been fighting Israel's wars for decades - Mossad wanted someone to take out the 7 countries around Israel and America almost did that - oil pipelines, gold, precious metals these are the reasons for war.
9559 2018-11-21 16:12:17 Your hurting the Americans working in the oil field. Take it easy there
9560 2018-11-21 16:12:13 Only 9% of our oil comes from the Saudis, but sure, let’s give props to the murderers!
9561 2018-11-21 16:12:13 When oil rallies to new highs Trump will tout the benefits to our energy producers and how he is fulfilling his campaign promises of leading us towards energy independence.
9562 2018-11-21 16:12:13 I know it’s been used before, but how about No Blood for Oil?
9563 2018-11-21 16:12:11 Let's make gas stations post the country of origin for their crude oil (just like grocers do with food) so Americans can make informed purchasing decisions. I'd drive right past Saudi stations.
9564 2018-11-21 16:12:08 TRUMP's political calculation is lower rather than higher oil prices are essential for his re-election bid
* TX and ND oil producers have no one else to vote for (won't vote for a pro-renewables Democrat)
* OH, PA and other swing states net consumers (benefit from lower prices)
9565 2018-11-21 16:11:55 I’m now a pastor. Do you want anointing oil ?
9566 2018-11-21 16:11:55 A Thai Cleaner Uses Eighteen Hundred Environmentalist Lithographs to Transform a Brazilian Salmon Oil Warehouse
9567 2018-11-21 16:11:54 Obviously, Trump will trade the lives of journalists living in America for cheap oil.
9568 2018-11-21 16:11:49 How many people have to be murdered for oil prices to go lower?  Not that it matters to you.

9571 2018-11-21 16:11:43 As others point out, you lie: oil is up, not down. And it's a dying industry, just like coal.  You and your corrupt, treasonous family and associates are the past. You and they will rot in prison and the rest of the world can move forward. Tic toc, traitor.
9572 2018-11-21 16:11:40 We get 40% of our crude oil from Canada, only 9% from Saudi. Not really sure why he needs to protect Saudi to keep oil prices down at all. Obviously has nothing to do with oil.
9573 2018-11-21 16:11:40 INSTRUCTIONS
Preheat a large skillet or wok to medium heat. Pour sesame oil in the bottom. Add white onion and fry until tender.Slide the onion, pour the beaten eggs onto the other side. Using a spatula, scramble the eggs. Once cooked, mix the eggs with the vegetable mix.
9574 2018-11-21 16:11:39 This UN-AMERICAN THING IN OUR WHITE HOUSE NEEDS TO BE REMOVED! HOW DARE HE SUPPORT THE SAUDI-ARABIAN LEADERS WHO ONLY PROVIDE 9% OF AMERICAN OIL. WHILE HE TALKS CRAP ABOUT CANADA WHO PROVIDES 40% OF THE OIL AMERICA USES! AND SAYS IT IS BECAUSE HE... NOW KEEPS OUR GAS PRICES LOW!
9575 2018-11-21 16:11:37 No.  He'll just take credit for the low oil prices and blame the Democrats when they rise.
9576 2018-11-21 16:11:36 You would think he would have the best information of where we’re getting most of our oil USA  !!!  this guy became our president because people actually voted for him I don’t know who scared me more the voters are the president #VoteBlue #voteblue2020
9577 2018-11-21 16:11:34 Because we sell raw oil to USA then sell us back gas at 12x the mark up because we dont have enough refineries to process our own products.
9578 2018-11-21 16:11:34 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that

9580 2018-11-21 16:11:28 Yeah let’s ignore our economy tanking and lie about oil prices. Last time crude was over $80 NYMEX was actually an open out cry exchange I think it was hurricane season ‘14 or ‘15. Crude Oil charts are predicting a rally and not to mention is up $12 a gallon in last year
9581 2018-11-21 16:11:23 They seem to be the good guys to the west ! Because they sell oil . Right is right , wrong is wrong no matter ur Russia , US , Saudis , Iran , Israel . But it seems different degrees of it
9582 2018-11-21 16:11:21 I’ve deep fried every year for 10 years now. I’m so meticulous to the details and measuring the bird in water and out before any oil goes in. It isn’t hard, but I don’t get people.
9583 2018-11-21 16:11:19 Oil
9584 2018-11-21 16:11:18 The leader of the free world has bee whipped and purchased by a desert Bedouin not even worth a dime, and the price was a few dollars discount on oil prices.. how much more are you planning to solicit, through your position as president of the USA ?
9585 2018-11-21 16:11:14 Check out the defense budget, subsidies to oil companies, billion dollar tax breaks for Amazon’s HQ, etc., etc., etc., @kmuthPAsenate44 @SenBobCasey
9586 2018-11-21 16:11:13 I swear if I can’t get this oil change I’m not going home 
9587 2018-11-21 16:11:13 It's not just the oil. It's trade (mostly weapons) access to bases and influence Saudi Arabia has in the area and the world economy.
It's gross but at the end of the day not surprising and people will forget about it in two weeks anyway.
>principles
>geopolitics
pick 1 and only 1
9588 2018-11-21 16:11:09 Don’t we get more oil from Canada than Saudi Arabia?
9589 2018-11-21 16:11:08 But only after Saudi Arabia and oil!
9590 2018-11-21 16:11:08 Blood for oil?!
9591 2018-11-21 16:11:04 So low oil prices justify the murder of a legal US resident?
You're sacrificing everything America stands for in order to get more money, and the world is laughing at us because of what you're doing
9592 2018-11-21 16:11:01 Instead you choose to continue to line the pockets of greedy oil tycoons who could care less about the environment or what state we are leaving our world in for our children. #TrumpIsAMoron
9593 2018-11-21 16:11:01 Agreed.  This is why IMO CNY oil & gold contracts so critical.  China's non-commodity goods trade surplus is ~$700B per IIF.  If China uses gold to gain ability to print CNY for oil & other commodities, China will NOT hit the wall 1st re: BoP...US govt will.
9594 2018-11-21 16:11:00 It’s the oil they excrete to preen themselves...still gross 
9595 2018-11-21 16:11:00 The whole thing about “yeah, Saudi Arabia viciously slaughtered a dissident US resident BUT LOOK AT HOW LOW OIL PRICES ARE!!!.”
9596 2018-11-21 16:10:59 The US would go to any extent to fulfill their addiction to snorting Oil $$
9597 2018-11-21 16:10:58 XOM is having a sale. They are the "Louis Vuitton" of the oil industry.
Love "big oil"!
9598 2018-11-21 16:10:58 @TheView Read Prince Salman's twitter page, he boasts, he hashtags #where'sjamal, he makes jokes about killing the CIA, about Dexter (watch the series).  This psychopath either scares trump or paid him a lot of $ to cover it up. Sanctions/no guns or oil w/Arabia, arrest him.
9599 2018-11-21 16:10:58 It's not the oil spigot from the Saudis Donald's concerned about it's that unlimited cash spigot that he has with them that he's looking out for and if he has to kill a few Americans to keep that open so be it as long as they don't hurt Ivanka
9600 2018-11-21 16:10:57 v interesting I haven’t really thought about it but looking into ppl who smoke pure THC oil would probably a way to assess that “zombified” effect
9601 2018-11-21 16:10:57 I always like low oil and gas prices, but I’d   rather pay more and not condone murdering journalists and having them hacked to little pieces @realDonaldTrump .
9602 2018-11-21 16:10:56 Since they don't think the E.S.A. is at all important, I suggest we remove the endangered elephant from the party logo & replace it with an oil well in Saudi colors.
9603 2018-11-21 16:10:52 I'm at work full of the oil 
9604 2018-11-21 16:10:49 Great news about lower oil prices for all those soybean farmers who don’t need to start their tractors, truckers with no crops to haul to market.
9605 2018-11-21 16:10:48 #dnd tips: Players, don't forget about very useful basic items in your packs! Think of creative ways you can use stuff like rope, poles, crowbars, oil, ball bearings, etc. both in and out of combat! Try to think outside the box as often as you can!

9610 2018-11-21 16:10:43 Canada supplies four times as much oil to the US than Saudi Arabia.
9611 2018-11-21 16:10:38 Picking up new headlights and getting my oil changed all by 8:15 in the morning is a whole new level of adulting
9612 2018-11-21 16:10:35 Here’s a thought, build a pipeline from the west to the east. Job creation on both ends and stop buying oil from countries with absolutely horrific lack of human rights. Keep doing business with these counties and you’re as responsible as their governments for what goes on there.
9613 2018-11-21 16:10:33 selling Oil at lower price is punishment to Saudi $ coffers. What would Sanctions do? Benefit of lower oil prices is pain.
9614 2018-11-21 16:10:32 @realDonaldTrump How dare you turn a blind eye to Saudi leader, he didn't lower our oil prices, he does pad YOUR PERSONAL POCKET THOUGH. How dare you TARNISH MY AMERICA !!!!
9615 2018-11-21 16:10:32 C’est le ecostyle qui marche pour moi ( le olive oil ou argan oil )
9616 2018-11-21 16:10:29 and they keep saying stop governments interventions in the economy, but begging Saudia Arabia one of the most corrupt countries on the planet, to infiltrate with the Oil Prices, because it suits them! #Hypocrisy

9619 2018-11-21 16:10:22 Any monies invested at 1st of year have been wiped out.
 In case of oil, OPEC keeps pumping while there is an oil glut now. Simple example of supply/demand.
9620 2018-11-21 16:10:20 …ぐぅ
9621 2018-11-21 16:10:19 If you would focus on building clean/alternative energy sources instead of feeding “big oil,” we wouldn’t have to rely on anyone for fuel sources and we would help the environment, cut finite resource usage and create thousands of jobs for those plants, right here in America.
9622 2018-11-21 16:10:15 1st legit rain is gonna cause hella accidents today on the freeway. PLEASE be careful on the road guys, it’s slippery AF from all the oil buildup from the summer.
9623 2018-11-21 16:10:15 So wood is bad, gas is bad, oil smells. I am running out of options here. I do recycle my glass and plastic though,
9624 2018-11-21 16:10:13 So many lies donald! US oil output has risen sharply over the past decade, pushing U.S. oil production to a record above 10 million barrels a day in 2018. Canada provides the foreign lion share of oil at 40%.
9625 2018-11-21 16:10:12 Oil companies in trouble if price stays down. Lots of debt in oil sector.
9626 2018-11-21 16:10:11 Gas Prices Are Up Because Of Sanction. USA Not Allowing Iran To Sell Oil. They are building Nuclear Weapons & Starting Wars. OIL IS $84.00 A Barrel.
PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLED SAUDI TO INCREASE PRODUCTION. OIL WENT DOWN TO $54.00 A BARREL. 
Saudi Important To Our National Interest
9627 2018-11-21 16:10:11 Trump: Dispicable comment:
Blood money is never acceptable. It’s evil. Period.
This is all about you:
We know you care more about helping yours, Ivanka’s and Jared’s Saudi business prospects and care nothing about what we pay for oil. 
So just stop trying to tell us differently.
9628 2018-11-21 16:10:11 This guy is too good to be truehe's selling oil bottles
9629 2018-11-21 16:10:10 U.S. oil production rising at fastest pace in 98 years and he thinks it's the Saudis that are bringing prices down... SMH
9630 2018-11-21 16:10:06 Crude oil price has increased over the past 18 months from $47.51 to $54. A barrel. Saudi Arabia provides only 11% of our oil & does not drive prices. We’re being lied to again.
9631 2018-11-21 16:10:04 I’ve wanted to try it.  Is it more tender?  What kind of oil do you fry it in?  How long does it take to cook?  Sorry for all the questions but I want to try making it   Thanking you in advance

INGREDIENTS
3 cups cooked rice
2 Tbs sesame oil
1 small white onion,
 2-3 Tablespoons soy sauce (more or less to taste)
2 eggs, 
2 Tbsp chopped green onions (optional)
9639 2018-11-21 16:09:46 And your problem is what?  Look at Brent prices for early October and stop lying.  The oil price decline is strictly a Trump accomplishment.  Whether you like it or not. Stop lying.  You are the liar, not POTUS.
9640 2018-11-21 16:09:46 Aho she uses twitter while enjoying olive oil
9641 2018-11-21 16:09:46 As a matter of fact, cheaper oil begets an even rosier picture for equities. Hey, we may pay "normal interest rates" but the fuel and energy is cheaper.
9642 2018-11-21 16:09:46 And not to mention... as someone who lives in Houston & works in O&G..... falling oil prices have crushed us since 2015. Does he know how falling oil prices negatively  impacts American families?
9643 2018-11-21 16:09:45 Oil is now cheaper than water
9644 2018-11-21 16:09:45 I'm thankful that we live in a country whose political leader believes the ordering for the decapitation and disappearance of a reporter who was speaking truth to power is more important than $14 billion dollars in military contracts and oil.

Oh, wait...
9645 2018-11-21 16:09:35 On the #M1 northbound at J25, the earlier collision involving 3 vehicles left a large volume of debris and oil, spread across a large area.  Industrial sweepers and heavy plant equipment are treating the road surface.  We'll open just as soon as it's safe too.
9646 2018-11-21 16:09:34 So I got all dressed up for work since it’s thanksgiving lunch today and we are off tomorrow.

Got my undershirt completely covered in coolant, oil and dirt.
Happy Thanksgiving Eve 
9647 2018-11-21 16:09:34 Talking oil, trade and the latest headlines for business with @cvpayne @foxbusiness today at 2p ET
9648 2018-11-21 16:09:30 American oil was supposed to stay with us while we moved to renewable energy. One more way in w Obama was BETTER than you!
9649 2018-11-21 16:09:30 Are YOU willing to give your life or the lives of loved ones for cheaper oil??
9650 2018-11-21 16:09:29 Don’t we get most of our oil from Canada? 40% comes from Canada and 11% comes from Saudi Arabia right? Why don’t you just thank Saudi Arabia for what you’re really thankful for, killing a journalist, and leave oil out of it.
9651 2018-11-21 16:09:27 North Dakota has more oil than Saudi Arabia.  America doesn't need Saudi Arabia,  but you certainly do. Such a weak stance you have put America into. Our moral compass must survive your total lack of morals.
9652 2018-11-21 16:09:23 Opec shud get its due
They looted peoples with high oil prices
9653 2018-11-21 16:09:22 #US Crude Oil Inventories Rise for 9th Week
Stocks of crude oil in the United States increased by 4.851 million barrels in the week ended November 16th 2018, following a 10.27 million increase in the previous week
9654 2018-11-21 16:09:20 OIL OIL OIL!!!!!!! ruined many countries for OIL. KEEP on feeding OIL
9655 2018-11-21 16:09:18 The US does not need foreign oil. Stop selling our oil- remember America first!!
9656 2018-11-21 16:09:17 Lower oil prices are a weapon AGAINST the United States by the Saudis. Low prices make American energy independence much more difficult to achieve by making shale production uneconomic. @FoxNews @SandraSmithFox @OutnumberedFNC @HARRISFAULKNER @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
9657 2018-11-21 16:09:16 Right now in Canada it costs $23 for a barrel of oil. That's 160 liters or 42 gallons. In Canada it costs 55 dollars for a 24 pack of Budweiser beer. I can by 320 liters of oil for cheaper than 8 liters of beer. Amazing.
9658 2018-11-21 16:09:16 I really do not want to do this oil change.
9659 2018-11-21 16:09:15 Jesus, don't tell me he's taking credit for the fall in oil prices-
9660 2018-11-21 16:09:10 We don't need opec oil!
9661 2018-11-21 16:09:08 Your time cycle analysis - is it specific to the crude oil market, or does it also include the general equities market?
9662 2018-11-21 16:09:08 Yes, thankyou, Canada.
After all we get almost half our oil from them
Saudi Arabia....Lil bit.
9663 2018-11-21 16:09:05 Theres blood in the oil
9664 2018-11-21 16:09:04 To join as rtailer to horizon.
How?
9665 2018-11-21 16:08:56 Let’s not get carried away on the lowering the oil price! #justsaying
9666 2018-11-21 16:08:50 Oil prices are mostly low in winter
9667 2018-11-21 16:08:47 Just a thought: Maybe we should demand justice for Kashoggi's premeditated murder (ordered by one of your bosses, MBS) AND cut our dependence on Saudi oil as we try to reverse climate change? That would be a real win-win. Don't thank the Saudis! MBS must be tried for murder.
9668 2018-11-21 16:08:45 Saudi is producing more supply than demand in terms of oil, this should only continue for a couple more weeks until they scale back drastically. Saudi needs oil prices to go up to $80/barrel in order to get Aramco’s IPO to go public in the stock market.
9669 2018-11-21 16:08:39 Let me get this right. You just thanked a nation who admitted to killing a United States journalist?! Fun fact, Tiny; Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia. Have someone read this to you
9670 2018-11-21 16:08:39 I can't even fathom how you can turn a blind eye to this heinous murder but then you go even further with a THANK YOU?! You are F'ing despicable! Also, ever stop to think of all the people that get laid off in the energy sector when oil prices drop? #houstoneconomy #jobs
9671 2018-11-21 16:08:38 Something tells me that in a situation like that where oil money dries up, SA's economy isn't diversified enough to withstand that--so there's a cash-grab among elites and investors to get out, the economy crashes, social unrest happens & radical groups come in stoking extremism
9672 2018-11-21 16:08:36 I am decarbing my cart oil so I can eat it i’ll update y’all if I die or just get really stoned.

9675 2018-11-21 16:08:29 If it was about oil prices, he wouldn’t scuppered the Iran deal. So how much $$ have the Saudis laundered to Kushner?
9676 2018-11-21 16:08:28 I like black seed oil but it gives me acid reflux
9677 2018-11-21 16:08:25 You do realize that lower oil prices kills American jobs in the petrochemical industry, Donald, yes? No? You're good with that, are you?
9678 2018-11-21 16:08:22 A lower oil price is often an indication of a slow down of the world wide economy. Enjoy it!
9679 2018-11-21 16:08:21 Again - they sold USTs as oil rose, which means one or both of your prior assertions (re: reducing reliance on USD or selling FX rsvs) cannot be true.
9680 2018-11-21 16:08:20 Your oil mafia might not let you on bigger scale 
9681 2018-11-21 16:08:18 明日6時起きマジ？
9682 2018-11-21 16:08:17 @AltHistoryHub What if Standard Oil never got broken up
9683 2018-11-21 16:08:15 The oil producing world could not have had it worse 1) West moving towards renewables 2) America turning up a windfall of oil.
9684 2018-11-21 16:08:15 Mr. Sorbo could use a history class on the Middle East from the time of Christ to the present. Note whom was terrorizing whom. Check out the crusades and ME and oil.
9685 2018-11-21 16:08:13 But,for how long would KSA have to contribute to lower oil prices,wouldn't it be detrimental to  state revenue?
9686 2018-11-21 16:08:13 To bad you can’t take credit for the oil prices nether can your murdering Saudi friend, America is the biggest oil producer and it seems our cartel has decided to put the Saudis out of business. And thank you Pres BHO for your foresight to make us non dependent on foreign oil.
9687 2018-11-21 16:08:12 Are you saying the cost of a barrel of oil justifies a murder. Everyday you sink lower than I think possible. Your position shows to the world that money is the only thing that matters not right or wrong, not morals and convictions but money. You are a sad person destroying us.
9688 2018-11-21 16:08:11 You do know that when the price of oil drops, AMERICANS LOSE THEIR JOBS. BEISERS, groveling to the Saudis shows how weak and pussified you are.

9692 2018-11-21 16:08:09 it's about the lowered price of oil today
9693 2018-11-21 16:08:05 Even though Canada is America's largest source of imported oil, by a longshot, @realDonaldTrump has chosen to thank Saudi Arabia.

The same Saudi Arabia that murdered an American journalist last month.
9694 2018-11-21 16:08:04 Canada oil doesn't much affect the world price of Brent because it cannot be shipped to anyone other than US. That's why it sells as low as $15. Who writes your crap..Trump?
9695 2018-11-21 16:08:02 coconut oil!!!!!!!!! can’t stress it enough 
9696 2018-11-21 16:08:01 Idiot Frump doesn't realize SA has had nothing to do with oil prices. World economy and oil demand slowing forcing prices down. Try to relate stock market loss over year to economic situation if you can relate events in other than single transaction mode.#NeverTrump #IdiotInChief

9699 2018-11-21 16:07:57 40% of your oil comes from Canada.  11% comes from Saudi Arabia.  But I don't expect you to actually know anything, so how about you just shut the hell up.  Money is more important than life to you, and that's pathetic!
9700 2018-11-21 16:07:57 Success. 
Carry the oil and just pour on the paper as per trend setter. 
9701 2018-11-21 16:07:53 We have turned our backs on Saudi abuses forever. Religious intolerance, treatment of women, beheadings, role in 9/11, anti-Israel policy etc. Military bases, oil, Iran, money, location, etc. These have always trumped our hypocritical outrage. This is just another example.
9702 2018-11-21 16:07:52 I used to do all my own maintenance. Plugs, wires, cap and rotors, oil changes, coolant changes, etc... Super easy to work on and maintain.

9704 2018-11-21 16:07:49 Donald Trump talks about oil prices being as low as they have ever been since he's been president what a tax savings he says well they're not and how about that 10% middle class tax relief that he promised more than 2 weeks ago he's so full of s*** it's pathetic

9706 2018-11-21 16:07:41 It's interesting that gas prices drop the same day that Trump said we should be thankful to the Saudi regime for our cheap oil. I'm sure there's nothing to see here....
9707 2018-11-21 16:07:41 @DNC @GOP I can not believe that this @realDonaldTrump  did a tweet to "Thank you to Saudi Arabia" for low oil prices after they chopped up a resident of America and a journalist.  He is beyond any  sort of humanity. Get children and families together for Holidays on boarder.
9708 2018-11-21 16:07:41 There are no saints in this oil business. US, Saudi, Russia and OPEC all use their power to get what they want at any time possible. The game is the game.
9709 2018-11-21 16:07:36 Not to put too fine a point on it but Saudi by no means controls the price of oil. In 2018 Russia & the US both exceeded Saudi in production. For a while now Russia has been agitating for a production cutback and price increase.

9713 2018-11-21 16:07:26 Canada supplies 40% of imported oil to the US, it's biggest supplier.
9714 2018-11-21 16:07:25 dear mr retarded leader trump you get 40% of your oil from Canada and 11% from Saudi Arabia do your homework you fat orange POS I can’t understand how anyone as stupid as you is still in the WH unfuckingbelievable
9715 2018-11-21 16:07:25 Basta Chinese, kahit na expert pa, pagdudahan mo na. I have nothing against them personally because I'm half Chinese myself, but lying is part of their culture. If they can cook siomai out of cardboard, or get recycle cooking oil out of the gutter, what else can they not do?
9716 2018-11-21 16:07:19 Saudi Arabia has sought to boost oil prices by promising to pump fewer barrels in December. A week ago, it backed a proposal for OPEC nations to cut production by one million barrels per day.
9717 2018-11-21 16:07:19 Trump thanks Saudi Arabia for lower oil prices
 
Oil producers are concerned about oversupply but could U-turn to please the president
9718 2018-11-21 16:07:17 Make the American Oil field workers broke again. You think the American Oil industry is nonprofit?  Nobody loses there jobs if oil goes to low?  Lost Oil field jobs plus the military equipment contract jobs at the same time.
9719 2018-11-21 16:07:16 How is our economy linked to Saudi Arabia? It is not OIL. Saudi Arabia is the US’s biggest arms customer (thanks to Lockheed, Boeing, Raytheon, among others). We are selling weapons to a country that is committing genocide in Yemen and arming Al Qaeda and ISIS indiscriminately.
9720 2018-11-21 16:07:15 They have not been burning like their supposed too, we keep sending it fire fighters to put it out. Misguided environmentalist have bocked every attempt to log local forest. Almost all of our lumber comes from Canada, what is the carbon footprint of all of this. Many oil wells.
9721 2018-11-21 16:07:14 Does trump understand when he thanks Saudi for lowering the price of crude oil, after he basically gave them a pass on murdering an American resident, that looks awfully consistent with quid pro quo?
9722 2018-11-21 16:07:14 Once, when I was seven, I got oil in my eye. It was uncomfortable, but I started calling myself oilyeye to own it. It is my earliest memory of owning my own mistake and I try to channel that energy.
9723 2018-11-21 16:07:13 Pssst...Saudi Arabia doesn’t set oil prices!  Look it up.
9724 2018-11-21 16:07:12 Are you capable of reading data on charts, or do you just respond with knee-jerk distortion of facts like the fascist in the White House you apparently adore? Oil prices FELL dramatically under Obama, and ROSE under Trump.
9725 2018-11-21 16:07:11 We don't breathe oil we breathe oxygen &it's free !!Trump is normalizing SAVAGE crimes #JamalKhashoggi was chopped alive  his  head and fingers were transported to Riadh bcse MBS said before I will cut the fingers of any journalist who dares to criticize me !! SHAME on you !
9726 2018-11-21 16:07:10 I wonder if this guy is aware that the US gets more gas from Canada then  SA. Also this dude acts like SA has all the leverage and everyone else has none. Iran has lots of oil reserves too but the US has no problems making them the boogie man of the middle east.
9727 2018-11-21 16:07:06 No More Oil!!
9728 2018-11-21 16:07:05 Oil is important
9729 2018-11-21 16:07:02 Nah, he'd have dropped the price of oil and you'd be all for him.
9730 2018-11-21 16:07:02 A lie. We get more oil from Canada.  You are evil.
9731 2018-11-21 16:06:54 Yep. So long as the simple maintenance was completed and they weren’t ever run low on oil, they go forever.
9732 2018-11-21 16:06:53 America gets 40% of its oil imports from Canada, 11% from Saudi Arabia moron. #IdiotInChief
9733 2018-11-21 16:06:53 I finally figured out what the Nazis were chanting in Charlotsville last year. "Blood for Oil"
9734 2018-11-21 16:06:53 Energy and tech shares recover poise
 
Oil prices also bounce but mood remains cautious as growth concerns reverberate
9735 2018-11-21 16:06:52 Sir - you and Saudis can’t go any lower. Oil prices are always up and down. Nothing to do with trump.
9736 2018-11-21 16:06:52 You're a BUFFOON. You have no idea how oil prices works, do you?
9737 2018-11-21 16:06:50 Go ahead and protect YOUR investments.  US has the biggest production in oil, something's that being hidden.  For people who depend on your lies,  they will never know because you have brainwashed them.  America first my foot. 
#lockHIMup
9738 2018-11-21 16:06:48 Many Americans depend on the price of oil to make a living. We are in this category. Kansas won’t be a red state must longer with comments like this!
9739 2018-11-21 16:06:47 We get more oil from Canada, stable genius. We don’t need Saudi oil.
9740 2018-11-21 16:06:43 Did Trump just say it's okay to murder people as long as the Saudis keep the oil prices down ?
9741 2018-11-21 16:06:42 David when I drop my car off to get an oil change: They’ll probably tell you that you have all kinds of stuff wrong, so don’t let them do that

*call comes in 20 mins later about a recommended service for my car 

Me: Yeah absolutely, get that taken care of!
David: They got you.
9742 2018-11-21 16:06:41 Oil is in a slump but not for long because the market isn’t over supplied.
9743 2018-11-21 16:06:37 @realDonaldTrump Mr.President ,here is 1 example how China Fair Trade work: Venezuela Criminal narco-regime  sigen an agreement with them gettin al oil fiel  and gold mines for nothing .Human rights to the garbage  i China fair trade
9744 2018-11-21 16:06:37 Oil. Great! Like Tax Cut America World. Enjoy! Thank Saudi Arabia!
9745 2018-11-21 16:06:37 Wonder which Oil & Gas lobbying firm she will join?
9746 2018-11-21 16:06:37 We will need this extra oil when ships have to use cleaner fuel in 2020 due to the climate hawks.  Diesel prices could soar!
9747 2018-11-21 16:06:36 When will gas prices drop? They’re still as high as when oil first went over 100.00 per barrel. Lower gas! lower gas! At least get below 2.00 for regular.

9749 2018-11-21 16:06:31 It’s not as simple as that. He’s looking out for Americans, doesn’t want us to pay 100. barrel for oil, lose thousands of jobs, mess up world economy over a guy that supported Muslim brotherhood! Wake up! Hating for the sake of hating isn’t good for anyone!
9750 2018-11-21 16:06:21 Despite the obvious kiss-assing to Saudi Arabia and the heartless lack of compassion for a murdered US journalist, he’s treating this oil thing as some kind of fucking game show. Oh right that’s his qualification to be president
9751 2018-11-21 16:06:19 You have no clue how the oil market works, do you
9752 2018-11-21 16:06:19 1. Is chub rub a new type of tobacco??

2. If not, how is oil applied to a chub/rub?
9753 2018-11-21 16:06:19 Good day sir OFW po ako dito sa Libya. Sana po sir di buong Libya Ban sobra lawak po ng Libya.    Mabuti pa po mga taga embassy makaka pasko sila at balik kmi oil worker dito lng 
9754 2018-11-21 16:06:11 umm I don't buy oil at a pump James. The chart shows average crude oil prices. If you're talking gasoline it's been my experience prices go up for summer and down for winter yes. Supply and demand. People travel much more in summer than winter.
9755 2018-11-21 16:06:09 Is not even the price of anything. The price of Oil has gone up since he took office not down. He’s lying in both directions.
9756 2018-11-21 16:06:05 The more journalists they kill the lower the oil prices. Is that how it works, Donny?
9757 2018-11-21 16:06:03 พิโฮป นี่ชิปเปอร์ตัวแทนหมู่บ้านอ่ะ #kookv
9758 2018-11-21 16:05:59 Canada supplies 40% of our oil; Saudi Arabia supplies 11% so why are you thanking the Saudis?
9759 2018-11-21 16:05:58 U proud of this @whca? The prez calls your members “enemy of the people” & yesterday supported the murder of a US based journalist by Saudi Arabia because “oil & guns”. I think your members should #boycott this event. Maybe @comedycentral @HBO could host an alternate event.
9760 2018-11-21 16:05:57 people stopped buying blood diamonds from Africa, maybe the same people can stop buying blood oil from Saudis
9761 2018-11-21 16:05:57 I really don’t see how lower gas prices would set America backward, on the contrary I think it would help the economy. Other countries need to stop their overly reliance on oil. Saudi is working towards that.
9762 2018-11-21 16:05:55 Question for those smarter than myself—why do all oil and gas pipelines have to travel through sacred Indian burial grounds or under our critical Great Lakes? Cost too much to go around them? Give me a break-those companies make more money than God.
9763 2018-11-21 16:05:50 Ur head get oil
9764 2018-11-21 16:05:48 You guys use more oil than produce
9765 2018-11-21 16:05:43 V r also a biggest importer of oil n had to settle bills through $.. Now modi is changing those clauses.. Read the latest economic development with Iran n Japan. No need to be an economist to understand this.
9766 2018-11-21 16:05:43 @Enterprise the customer service at your Lake Havasu, AZ branch is beyond terrible. The fact that you clowns would give a customer a car without an oil cap and then refuse to fix the problem is beyond bullshit.
9767 2018-11-21 16:05:36 Trump's decisions always aim to help American people. Individual rights are important here, but our justice system's not based on rumors & claims. Saudi has control over its legal matters. Trump was open & honest but not complete. Many good reasons to support KSA- not just oil.
9768 2018-11-21 16:05:34 Organic supply Argan oil. Pake malam paginya kempes tanpa bekas lagi.
9769 2018-11-21 16:05:32 From the recent All time High there is 23% drop in crude oil price but the OMC has reduced and pass on only 9% to people of country. Where is the deregulation?. Just cheating with people.
9770 2018-11-21 16:05:25 Gas prices were lower under Obama than all of your time in office. Saudi Arabia no longer controls the oil market.
9771 2018-11-21 16:05:21 You have to joking bro.  Gas is $2.85 in Phoenix.  Do you think America is that dumb to fall for your BS Oil prices.  #fuckyouverymuch

9774 2018-11-21 16:05:04 The US is a net exporter now. The Wirld order of oil has been flipped on its head.
9775 2018-11-21 16:05:00 And we don’t mind the coziness of all other administrations even with high oil prices !
9776 2018-11-21 16:04:59 Look here now I’m here for an oil change. Dassit
9777 2018-11-21 16:04:59 many places in Canada have oil, Alberta, Ontario and offshore Newfoundland.
9778 2018-11-21 16:04:52 We think the Fed must continue raising rates because nothing fundamentally has changed in the market except there is a glut and people who invest in oil have brought the price down.   

Wall street can jump and stammer, sell, etc. but there are buyers.
9779 2018-11-21 16:04:52 More revenue for the oil companies and not a price break for everyone
9780 2018-11-21 16:04:51 'Oil prices getting lower. Great! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World. Enjoy! $54, was just $82. Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let’s go lower!'
President Donald Trump.
9781 2018-11-21 16:04:51 Do you think killing journalists results in lower oil prices?  You can't really go any lower.
9782 2018-11-21 16:04:47 U can make pizza with vegan cheese and the dough doesnt have to contain eggs.
Only water salt sugar yeast flour oil.
9783 2018-11-21 16:04:46 International oil prices have gone down by half during last 3 months ( since PTI came to power) they now stand at $ 54 per barrell. Why petrol prices not being lowered. Why tricle down effect NOT being passed down to masses.
9784 2018-11-21 16:04:45 Even though the reality is that Trump has driven prices up by seeking to sanction Iran. Oil prices dropped recently because Trump's tax cut is a failed mess and now the market foresees a major recession on the way.

9786 2018-11-21 16:04:41 Um, we get almost half our oil from Canada. A little over 10% from Saudi Arabia. So I’m guessing that the “Thank You” is about appeasing your money-backers.
9787 2018-11-21 16:04:41 @POTUS thanks @SaudiArabia for lower oil price, doubling down on defence of kingdom. Markets never stop surprising us.

9792 2018-11-21 16:04:37 His tweet, to me, says "As long as the Sauds give us oil they can genocide the Yemeni as long as they like!"
9793 2018-11-21 16:04:36 Does this mean that trump thinks Khashoggi's death was worth $27 per oil drum? Allowing Saudi's to kill whomever they want is against the law, making trump guilty of taking part in the murder, torture, and dismemberment of an American! Who's next? Stop murdering the innocent!
9794 2018-11-21 16:04:33 You are content to sit on Twitter and superficially condemn things while advocating that any actual pushback (even the most minimal) against those things will cause the collapse of the United States. 

Some US hegemony huh? Under the thumb of Saudi Arabia over oil..
9795 2018-11-21 16:04:31 His every statement is code - and it is very easy to break. By America he means 'those who are loyal to me and pay me lots of money'. Lol. Thats the thing with snake oil salesmen - it only works until one gets burned.
9796 2018-11-21 16:04:29 A) letting them get away south murder because they buy his properties. Emaluments clause violations obvious.

B) does he think oil prices are a favor? Does he think if Apple prices go down, that's Washington doing California a solid?
9797 2018-11-21 16:04:26 We are already paying more now than when Obama left office. This oil crap coming out of his mouth is just that.  He’s afraid of the Saudis
9798 2018-11-21 16:04:24 Trump had nothing 2 do with lower oil prices. Don't b giving him credit! While there is many reasons no1 is the middle east flooded the market 2 disrupt and destroy the western worlds oil production industry.
9799 2018-11-21 16:04:20 But wait....isn’t it the increase in US oil production that is driving down gas prices?
9800 2018-11-21 16:04:13 At $54 and still expected to drop further, are we ready for the falling oil prices? Have we learned from our mistakes? Can we survive another?
9801 2018-11-21 16:04:10 They turned a blind eye to thousands murdered on 9/11 and set their good eye on Iraq who did absolutely nothing to us. Even worse American/Saudi relations became stronger than ever. If they'd turn a blind eye to thousands of Americans murdered on 9/11 for Oil, why would 1 matter?
9802 2018-11-21 16:04:10 Well.... NCA know ..GCHQ know Mueller Knows EVERYTHING

so. who knows

It seems the executive Government are above the law allowing a referendum that was funded by Billionaires in America with oil interests / enabled by Murdoch and Rothschild (media TAX & Oil interests) & Kremlin
9803 2018-11-21 16:04:06 It’s not just oil Terry, it’s our position of influence in the Middle East that involves Saudi Arabia.

9806 2018-11-21 16:04:02 @TheView Trump is right - low oil prices are more important than what Saudis did to their citizen.  Its not our business - what if Saudis complained about electing Obama - would we take heed ? ofcourse not
9807 2018-11-21 16:03:59 I don’t see fragrance in there when I look at the ingredients. I wonder if the scent is coming from an oil that’s present?
9808 2018-11-21 16:03:57 He hasn't one bit of control over oil prices but yet he's taking credit for dropping oil prices. Funny, he never apologizes when they go back up. And where the hell is that middle class tax cut he said they were working on two weeks ago even when Congress wasn't in session.
9809 2018-11-21 16:03:57 my wife pan fries them in coconut oil and tops them off with a little bit of lemon pepper and they are delicious

9814 2018-11-21 16:03:53 Presidental agenda for Thanksgiving 2018:
Tweet about oil prices
Brag that he's at his "winter White House"
Golf
Eat
Eat
Toilet Tweets telling everyone to be thankful for their "favorite president"
Barf!!! (us)
End another day crying yourself to sleep.
9815 2018-11-21 16:03:51 Meanwhile Trump is tweeting thanks to Saudi Arabia because oil prices dropped.
9816 2018-11-21 16:03:48 Oil gonna cost .05 soon
9817 2018-11-21 16:03:48 ps ..u guys should try looking at charts..

monthlies ..long term debt ..oil consumption ect 

..and stop believing MSM and Fin journos
9818 2018-11-21 16:03:47 Saudi Arabia and Russia cut oil production to raise prices & increase their income. Oil prices are lower cuz of increased US production. We own Saudis nothing. Trump boasts $50 Million in condo sales to Saudis on the other hand while denying business with Saudis. #Liar
9819 2018-11-21 16:03:46 The third and most likely choice IMO is that they’re business partners with Vlad. One word: oil.
9820 2018-11-21 16:03:41 US Production keeps increasing but exports have stalled...if this trend continues oil will not re-enter bull market. #OOTT
9821 2018-11-21 16:03:41 Lower oil prices do not compensate for massive stock market losses which impact everyone with a retirement plan.  Crude was at $29 in January 2016 under the Great Presisent Obama.  He didn’t have to brag or sell his soul to the Saudis.
9822 2018-11-21 16:03:35 WTI oil at $54.77/barrel, +$1.34.
9823 2018-11-21 16:03:35 40% of our oil imports are from Canada.
9824 2018-11-21 16:03:34 We should hold county leaders and city leaders accountable. The two main industries oil and farming could reduce or Get rid of air pollution with technology we have today. It’s about property tax and consumption taxes they’re afraid of losing
9825 2018-11-21 16:03:34 Oil changes today come with a free potato 
9826 2018-11-21 16:03:33 Oh, that's easy:  raise oil prices and refuse to follow through on the arms sales commitments.  Or make veiled references to @realDonaldTrump 's tiny hands.
9827 2018-11-21 16:03:32 If he keeps pushing for low oil prices I’ll be forced to vote for someone else!
9828 2018-11-21 16:03:31 What is wrong with you?!?! Really! 

Sucking up to Saudi Arabia again to protect YOUR financial interests.

Also, oil was at $47 and change last year.  Clueless moron! 

Also, majority of US oil comes from Canada,  did you think to thank them?
9829 2018-11-21 16:03:29 It’s ok when Leftists do it
9830 2018-11-21 16:03:28 Loading up van. Checked water and oil. Need to stop and get oil on the way. Should be on the road in less than an hr, fingers crossed. May need to tie kids up soon. Ugh. Love the stress of a road trip.
9831 2018-11-21 16:03:25 Maybe Botswana Oil should consider participating in the black friday phenomenon......in tht way this wil spill over to the filling stations participation as well.
9832 2018-11-21 16:03:22 And any type of cooking oil is called Saladi
9833 2018-11-21 16:03:10 If ever there was a more simple-minded president, it is amazing the nation survived. Have you ever thought deeply enough, or asked an aid to think it through for you, so that you could actually understand the complexity of oil prices on the US economy?
9834 2018-11-21 16:03:06 헉..섹파 태왕계유..
9835 2018-11-21 16:03:04 Of course, Saudi Arabia didn't make the oil prices low, the glut of oil on the market did that. And the prices aren't all that low, we had lower prices under Obama.
9836 2018-11-21 16:03:03 Posted elsewhere by CBC how USA gets 11% of its oil from S-Arabia, 40% from Canada. Sigh..
9837 2018-11-21 16:03:02 There are studies comparing olive oil to butter and Argan oil to butter and butter always loses. Not sure of any studies vs lard but doubt lard would be that much different vs. butter.
9838 2018-11-21 16:03:01 Obama did better.  Let Iran and Saudis fight it out for market share in the oil market. We will then see the real price of oil. It could be as low as 10$ per barrel. You did a favor to the Saudis and Russians by imposing sanctions on Iran.
9839 2018-11-21 16:02:58 @realDonaldTrump I bet the oil companies won't lower fuel prices.  The American people are too easily brainwashed to believe in voting democrat.  This veterans is tired is the democrat BS, there's too many lawyers in office.
9840 2018-11-21 16:02:57 Pilihan @olla_ramlan jatuh pada @ForceMagicID 2in1 karena mengandung Eucalyptus Oil yang mampu menolak nyamuk masuk ke ruangan. Jadi gak khawatir nyamuk ikut masuk keluar kamar. Dengan @ForceMagicID 2in1, nyamuk zombie gak akan bangun lagi.
9841 2018-11-21 16:02:55 Low oil prices isn’t a good thing, it terrifies us in the oil industry that were out of work for almost 4 years. I say f*** the world, the USA is all that matters. Please Mr. President, don’t give in to ANY leftist BS, just keep making America Great and we will re-elect you
9842 2018-11-21 16:02:54 Oil prices are lower because of American production not Saudi.  But shouldn't our gas prices be going down too? Or are they just pocketing the profits instead of lowering prices?Something you would do.
9843 2018-11-21 16:02:53 Oil went up stupid, not down... you are also going down really soon #Muelleriscomingforyou
9844 2018-11-21 16:02:52 Ah, my evolutionary metaphor associations going wild now... :)
They event want to bring the planet back to the temperatures during the time of the dinosaurs - by burning the sulfury oil found in those dragons graves...
9845 2018-11-21 16:02:47 I disagree to! We should fully sanction Saudi and shut down 100% if thier oil exports!
9846 2018-11-21 16:02:41 How are you going to punish him Brennan? Quit buying his oil? Cut off diplomatic relations> Come on genius. Solutions not criticism for a change!
9847 2018-11-21 16:02:39 I wonder if that guy in the White House even knows how much oil we have left? Just a feeling but I bet not!
9848 2018-11-21 16:02:34 Like marinate in olive oil, lemon juice, and some herbs and spices (black pepper, oregano, basil, whatever else you like) and a little bit of garlic?
9849 2018-11-21 16:02:32 The white house is place of Devils.blood=nil against oil.
9850 2018-11-21 16:02:18 Brussels are binge-worthy: 
(1) Select smaller heads, which are sweeter and more tender
(2) Halve them to increase surface area
(3) Toss in olive oil, salt and pepper. Diced pancetta, bacon or pork belly are optional
(4) Roast in uncrowded pan at about 425 F; allow them to brown
9851 2018-11-21 16:02:15 Lower oil prices don’t erase your rampant corruption and boundless idiocy. #FakePresident
9852 2018-11-21 16:02:15 I never really acknowledge the maintenance that goes into a car until I started paying for it. An oil change, replace ur windshield wipers, your freaking LIGHTS! Your fucking air filters..I just found out that my damn tires need to be rotated #TakeTheKeys
9853 2018-11-21 16:02:13 Kudos to Trump for publicly admitting we serve the Saudis and have been since the oil embargo of the 70s - or, as I call it, The Great Pimp Slap.
9854 2018-11-21 16:02:11 Scandanavian societies are just goals. There were plans to establish such a fund for our expected oil proceeds. If only we do it properly!
9855 2018-11-21 16:02:06 Anyone wanna get me an oil change for Christmas??
9856 2018-11-21 16:01:58 Have they informed him where most of the oil comes from? It is not the Saudis. Here is a hint, it is just north of the US.
9857 2018-11-21 16:01:57 And the #glut of #oil hasn't hit my gas station yet. In California, we are all paying $4.00 a gallon for mid-grade.
9858 2018-11-21 16:01:57 Oil prices “trumps” moral values.
9859 2018-11-21 16:01:54 Hey @realdonaldtrump 40% of imported oil to the US comes from Canada according to the American Petroleum Institute. Only 11% or so comes from Saudi Arabia. So maybe it would make sense to play nicer with Canada on trade & tariffs if oil partners get special consideration. @CNN
9860 2018-11-21 16:01:52 Drop in global oil prices but ERC will increase prices come next month.
9861 2018-11-21 16:01:49 The guy supposed to be changing my oil and he gon walk in here and tap me n say “ you ain’t been swattin at them kids back there with that fly swatter have you”  now you now we in the south lol that’s exactly why I got it in the car
9862 2018-11-21 16:01:41 Isn’t Canada the biggest supplier of oil to the US? @realDonaldTrump
9863 2018-11-21 16:01:35 #idrather...clean the toilets, repaint the house, give the dog a bath, change the oil on the car...then go #blackfriday shopping.  What else could I do???
9864 2018-11-21 16:01:27 How much would the cost to the country be if we left with no deal? A lot more than £39m, that's for sure. The lost tax revenues from the City alone would dwarf that.  You should go back to selling snake oil. @LeaveEUOfficial
9865 2018-11-21 16:01:24 We import far more oil from Canada than we do from Saudi Arabia. You’re ignorant.
9866 2018-11-21 16:01:24 The salesman approach is inherently dishonest, and it has infected too much of the "evangelical" movement.  It has become snake oil.
9867 2018-11-21 16:01:20 From your oil buddies in Saudi Arabia
9868 2018-11-21 16:01:19 Ok but on a more serious note it's a difficult issue Saudis control oil and just like China who oppresses didsidents  do we just cut them off and geopolitical consequences be damned?
9869 2018-11-21 16:01:17 Trump is the first president since Reagan to pressure Saudis successfully to reduce oil prices significantly.  That is America first. All citizens and industries benefit from less expensive fuels.
9870 2018-11-21 16:01:17 What if instead of a pharmacy we opened up a karmacy? Instead of prescription drugs you just buy healing crystals and other snake oil items.

774/2018 #2018Jokes
9871 2018-11-21 16:01:16 You overstate the situation. Saudis play us by not overtly hating Israel. That it. Otherwise they gouge us on oil, kill with impunity, and play both sides against the middle. As saying goes, with friends like this....
9872 2018-11-21 16:01:06 Follow the money. Its not first administration to do the saudi suck up. Bush flew saudis out on 911 sans questions when flights were grounded. They were bin laden relatives. A fewyears ago,low oil prices destabilized the ruble and ended big russia/china deal
9873 2018-11-21 16:01:01 oil was already low, he has changed nothing, but taken credit anyway. what a hero!
9874 2018-11-21 16:01:00 As if you had anything to do with it. You really are a moron. Oil prices are a reflection of supply. When there is a surplus which there currently is oil prices go lower, when there’s an oil shortage prices go up. Although I’m sure you’ll still get a decent cut
9875 2018-11-21 16:00:59 Engine coming apart. Lots of burnt oil ... :(
9876 2018-11-21 16:00:58 CBD oil
9877 2018-11-21 16:00:57 You sold your soul for oil?
9878 2018-11-21 16:00:55 Yes. But Trump will tell you that Canada gets its oil from Saudi Arabia. Stable genius, you know.
9879 2018-11-21 16:00:54 CIA MUST See All Evidence Clearly Proving Terrorisms/Wars Were End Results of Frictions/Tensions/Hostilities Initiated/Caused/Fuelled By Permanent Members of UNSC For Selling Expensive Weapons & Buying Cheap Oil To/From Dictators Installed/Protected By Permanent Members of UNSC.
9880 2018-11-21 16:00:47 It’s always about the Oil Cartels, they are running scared right now with the EV’s coming.
9881 2018-11-21 16:00:44 @Oreo drop the dirty palm oil .... stop killing our planet!!!! #dropthedirtypalmoil #oreopalmoil
9882 2018-11-21 16:00:43 it's ok to MURDER AND DISMEMBER people, as long as you drop oil prices??!?!?  #wow
9883 2018-11-21 16:00:43 Just a reminder Canada supplies more oil to you than Saudi Arabi. Your welcome.
9884 2018-11-21 16:00:37 As more & more Electric, Plug in Hybrids, Hybrid cars are added to US roads, u can see the US oil consumption flat or down in few years.
9885 2018-11-21 16:00:37 Plus she’s worth $100 million. All from oil and gas and big pharma and insurance companies. What do you think she has in common with us? Nothing
9886 2018-11-21 16:00:34 Privatization of NNPC will bring so much jobs and competition in the oil sector, and will cause the fuel price to automatically fall just like telecom sector.
For now all our refineries are not even 20% functioning because of mismanagement of funds in @NNPCgroup.
#Atikulated
9887 2018-11-21 16:00:32 Can I sub a couple of my Fat Daddio cake pans then?  No malt powder or enough coconut oil & in no mood to fight the grocery store.  LOL
9888 2018-11-21 16:00:29 (به عنوان مثال یه مخزن Shale Oil در داکوتای شمالی دارن امریکایی‌ها با ۲۰۰ میلیارد بشکه ذخیره‌ی درجا که در قیمت‌های بالای ۱۰۰ دلار صرفه داره تولیدش و باقی موندن قیمت تو اون حد و پیشرفت تکنولوژی‌های برداشت، دوباره قیمت رو میاره پایین)
9889 2018-11-21 16:00:27 there is a recipe mentioned in Exodus calling for cannabis, olive oil, myrrh, and cinnamon used for anointment. just something to remind your aunt after your walk with your cousins this thursday

9892 2018-11-21 16:00:24 The Saudis are planning to produce less in December to push oil prices up, and are urging neighbours to do the same. World oil price will go up for everyone, including the Moron-in-Chief.
9893 2018-11-21 16:00:16 After this oil change I’m about to watch SO much tv today #ChillMode
9894 2018-11-21 16:00:12 You dummy, let’s be consistent and not play favorites. What is cheap Saudi oil doing to the boom in domestic energy production? What about all those oil states who were promised jobs and will have curtail some of the long term. Oh yes, the Prince is YOUR friend.
9895 2018-11-21 16:00:10 I'm five days late for my period and hosting a dinner tomorrow for 20 people that involves boiling oil. I think I better serve the pie first.  At least they'll die happy.
9896 2018-11-21 16:00:10 Was at the show and that venue looks like the Kevin costner's Waterworld the scene were the "smokers" are rowing the oil tanker...
9897 2018-11-21 16:00:09 Our governments are doing nothing to curb climate change. Fracking, Oil, Coal, Intensive Farming, Logging, Deforestation, .............EXTINCTION!
9898 2018-11-21 16:00:07 The PIPELINE would resolve Alberta’s economic woes. Not taxing the people. Making the people of Alberta pay extra tax would further stress the economy. We don’t have lots of advantages logistically speaking to attract businesses . 5% tax and oil is our Forte.
9899 2018-11-21 16:00:07 Congratulated Saudi Arabia on the price of oil, even though it happens to just be in their country, and they murdered a US journalist.
9900 2018-11-21 16:00:00 & there’s power in self talk. When feeling anxious/down tell yourself “I’m bigger than this, rise above”. & meditation 1-2 times a day is so helpful. I love ‘grounding’ meditations. & CBD oil is very helpful. I wish you the best. Keep faith in ur journey 
9901 2018-11-21 15:59:56 Hey DumbA$$, Khasshoghi is not a US Citizen and IS a member of ISIS!  I guess MbS should cut off all oil sales to the US due to their outrage over the crimes (child trafficking and murder to name two) committed by the Clinton Crime Syndicate!  You are clearly that stupid!
9902 2018-11-21 15:59:54 그림..대충 그려도 단순해 보이지만 탄탄하고 입체적이고 자연스러워 보이는 그림을 그리고 싶다.......
9903 2018-11-21 15:59:52 Funny but my gas price still goes up and up. So oil companies make profits and we the consumer still pay more? Nice job Trump! HOpe you get all the campaign funds you need to railroad another section of the American people
9904 2018-11-21 15:59:52 It's cute that you think Dumb Orange Reagan doesn't have oil speculator friends that are losing their shit right now
9905 2018-11-21 15:59:51 Oil
9906 2018-11-21 15:59:51 Wouldn't be surprised if jafar is there. He could be the supplier of all the snake oil @MBuhari is selling to us nigerians.
9907 2018-11-21 15:59:46 @realDonaldTrump Apparently the life of an American Journalist has a value of $28. That’s the difference between the previous and current crude oil PPB. You are disgustingly transparent.
9908 2018-11-21 15:59:43 Commodities are broadly recovering ground as the US dollar weakens on the day (-0.2%). Crude oil is up 1.7% and gold has advanced 0.6%
9909 2018-11-21 15:59:42 Not supply and demand. Artificially limiting supply by imposing sanctions on Iran. Let Iran and Saudis fight for market share in the oil market. We will then know the real price of oil. My bet - it’s between 10-30$ per barrel.
9910 2018-11-21 15:59:39 You shouldn't let him pretend he is responsible for the price of oil. Saudi Arabia is tearing its hair out of the current price. It's not the result of some grand deal he struck with the Saudi's. He's such a liar.
9911 2018-11-21 15:59:33 Thanks on the oil prices! Now, isn't ICE a Federal organization & places like Mo., that ignored the ICE detainer(s) & then the guy killed 3 people, shouldn't that Police Dept. be held accountable Federally, for violating the ICE detainer? These Dept's have to be held accountable!
9912 2018-11-21 15:59:29 Disposing of Cooking oil is such a pain in the ass.
9913 2018-11-21 15:59:25 絶対絶命都市4かな？(゜ロ゜)
9914 2018-11-21 15:59:23 Olive Oil prices getting lower. Great! Like a big Tax Cut for Rome and the Hellenistic World. Enjoy! Just 54 sesterce per amphora was 82 sesterce! Thank you to Pontus, but let’s go lower!
9915 2018-11-21 15:59:20 Oil prices lower due to increased American production and no increases in demand due to conservation efforts
9916 2018-11-21 15:59:18 I be looking lost as fuck when the mechanic be talking to me during my oil change. I just be nodding my head pretending to know the terminology and whatever else they be saying.
9917 2018-11-21 15:59:15 Top40 +0.64%; JSE value $1.4bn/R20.0bn; R/$ 13.91; R/£ 17.81; R186 9.04, gold 1 227, plat 848; CU 2.80; oil 54.43
9918 2018-11-21 15:59:15 How many journalists will be killed off per penny lower of oil?
9919 2018-11-21 15:59:14 We get less than 3% of our oil from SA. Mexico and Canada are our major oil partners. 

What we need to do is get OPEC to boot them or have prices pegged to market demand and ignore OPEC'S demand for prices.

We do that, SA loses all power.

That being said, sanctions are needed.
9920 2018-11-21 15:59:13 เป็นป่ะที่ฟังเพลงเกาหลีจนกลับไปฟังเพลงไทยไม่ได้แล้ว 55555555 ดนตรีมันได้อ่ะแก
9921 2018-11-21 15:59:10 Maybe not security. But stupidity. You can’t bend it to fit. It shouldn’t have been done. Just like telling everyone after the journalist death that SA will pay, and then retracting. Money and oil is a helluva drug
9922 2018-11-21 15:59:10 1961 mate, 7 years before we did (without 'oil money')
9923 2018-11-21 15:59:06 but its lies bc oil prices aren't actually down and also Canada gives us more oil than SA so we should kiss their backsides by his logic...but now this tweet will get spread on internet and fox and his followers will start to absorb that SA is indispensable friend
9924 2018-11-21 15:59:05 Yeah! Ignore assassinations and dismemberment of innocent journalists as long as we can save a few bucks on oil and sell billions in weapons to the perpetrators! All you’ve accomplished is demonstrate that now America is just as bad as the next authoritarian regime. No principles
9925 2018-11-21 15:59:02 Murder for oil. #ImpeachTrump
9926 2018-11-21 15:59:02 And hate Alberta Oil.
But Love Saudi Oil.
9927 2018-11-21 15:59:01 You should be forced to listen to the tape of #Kashoggi being murdered. Maybe the horror of what they did would make you reconsider being ‘friends’ with Saudi Arabia, even if they did lower the oil prices in return for your friendship.
9928 2018-11-21 15:59:01 MAKE TRUMP DRINK THE OIL. THE CIVILIZED WORLD IS THREATENED BY HIM AS NEVER BEFORE IN OUR TIME. HITLER BUTCHERED EUROPE, BUT TRUMP WILL DESTROY LIFE ON EARTH IF HE IS NOT STOPPED.
9929 2018-11-21 15:58:59 You do understand with oil prices is that oil is a private industry. This means that oil prices can be determined by numerous factors, very few of them having anything to do with the US government or who is acting as president.
9930 2018-11-21 15:58:52 Merciless crude oil disinformation war under way right now.
9931 2018-11-21 15:58:48 I see it as bullish for few reasons... refiners just started to produce distillates so demand goes up & we see reduction from 10mm barrels to 4mm moreover Saudi shipping less + cold temperatures in Canada will dumpen oil production in addition to holidays hence Bullish trend.
9932 2018-11-21 15:58:37 I think they are more after don’t put frozen turkeys in fry oil
9933 2018-11-21 15:58:37 Perhaps he should check current crude oil prices vs. when he took office and thank the Saudis again.  Over 30% higher.  Can this dude open is mouth just once without spewing BS?
9934 2018-11-21 15:58:36 Maybe we had better thank the Khasoggi family too, for their sacrifice, so that we can have lower oil prices!  You scratch my back & I’ll scratch yours!
9935 2018-11-21 15:58:33 He's literally trying to bribe MBS in plain sight for oil prices in exchange for his continued Kashoggi murder support because everyone reminded him yesterday gas was cheaper under Obama.
9936 2018-11-21 15:58:33 Oil supplies on the market determine price
9937 2018-11-21 15:58:33 *Friend:*
Where does your husband work?

*Wife:*
He’s with Oil & Gas.

*Friend:*
Wow... where is he based?

*Wife:*
Kitchen!!!


9938 2018-11-21 15:58:32 Oil sales and weapon purchases are both harmful to the planet and people.
9939 2018-11-21 15:58:31 Saudi Arabia only sells us 9% of the oil we use, the rest comes from Canada.
You're a lying piece of sh*t. 
Gas prices are still out of control by the way.
9940 2018-11-21 15:58:30 So, "We'll murder Khashoggi, and if the world finds out, we'll lower the price of a barrel of oil for awhile, and see if we can distract everyone,"

9942 2018-11-21 15:58:22 Trump: 
Oil prices getting lower. Great! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World. Enjoy! $54, was just $82. Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let’s go lower!

9943 2018-11-21 15:58:22 Trump putting sanctions on Iran makes Saudi and Russia wealthy

1 year ago oil was $53 a barrel. 
It went up to $85 a barrel since Trump pulled out of the Iran deal.

Saudi pumps about 8 million barrels per day.

Multiple that by $32 increase Trump caused. 

Now figure in Russia
9944 2018-11-21 15:58:21 You do realize that low oil price hurts American producers at home and abroad?

9946 2018-11-21 15:58:18 Is Kansas as dependent on oil & gas as Oklahoma? Below $2 here and jobs & businesses start going away. I'd like it to be around $2.50 ~ not so low jobs are lost & not high enough to get more people in the industry (we need to diversify LOL) & still affordable.
9947 2018-11-21 15:58:13 But he got lower oil prices....so the murder doesn’t really matter.
9948 2018-11-21 15:58:12 Who cares that they ordered an assassination, so long as I can get my fuel for cheaper! And while we are on the oil topic - climate change is still #FakeNews right?
9949 2018-11-21 15:58:01 We get most of our oil from Canada.  Nice try
9950 2018-11-21 15:57:59 Oh so if they lower oil prices, you forgive the killing...
9951 2018-11-21 15:57:58 It's not about oil. tRUMP doesn't give a damn about gas prices. He cares only about himself and his fortune. This is what Saudis spend with him personally on his properties.

9954 2018-11-21 15:57:53 I doubt the oil or the arms have anything to do with it in reality. Trump is a toxic narcissist. The only things that motivate him are personal, profit or flattery. He's also greedy, so this one is likely profit.

9957 2018-11-21 15:57:50 Stock Market all time high! ... oh wait, that was a while ago. Oil prices get lower! ... yeah that’s the message for this week.
9958 2018-11-21 15:57:46 this discussion is the price of oil per barrel. It doesn't reflect gas prices.
9959 2018-11-21 15:57:46 Are you crazy, trump? We don’t want lower oil prices? Oil companies will not develop new oil fields with lower oil prices.

9966 2018-11-21 15:57:33 There is red oil there na??
9967 2018-11-21 15:57:33 Look! The oil-company doesn’t even dare call the oil by name. What about “long duration stored solar energy”?
9968 2018-11-21 15:57:33 Lower oil prices take precedence over human life. #MakeAmericaGrotesqueAgain

9970 2018-11-21 15:57:29 My 4yo leaves his shirts all over the fucking house and I can’t find them when he needs a certain one for school.  Where’s your essential oil for that Patricia?!
9971 2018-11-21 15:57:27 Words don't create fed policy.  action does.  Lower oil prices will cause the fed to pause in December.
9972 2018-11-21 15:57:23 Sorry, except for the studies paid for by Big Oil. If you see 100 doctors and 97 of them tell you that you have cancer, you're going to listen to the other 3 and just ignore it?
9973 2018-11-21 15:57:20 We get 4x as much oil from Canada, but you call them our enemy.

Just admit that you are the real enemy of the American people.
9974 2018-11-21 15:57:19 دوم این تحریم مشخصا در کوتاه مدت قیمت رو می‌بره بالا، ولی از اون طرف منابع نفتی مثل Shale Oil که در قیمت‌های بالا صرفه‌ی اقتصادی تولید دارن رو وارد بازار می‌کنه و در میان مدت بازار به طور کلی فروشنده رو حذف می‌کنه.
9975 2018-11-21 15:57:16 No they won’t, because you obviously don’t understand how the price of oil works.  Oil is set at a specific dollar price per barrel. That’s what they can sell it for

9977 2018-11-21 15:57:08 I’d rather pay more for oil than have American journalists murdered. #NotMyPresident

9979 2018-11-21 15:57:06 Yes. Thank you to our President! He made a deal with the Saudis. We won´t talk about or expose the Saudi´s involvement of the death of journalist,  Koshoggi, for cheaper oil! Now THAT´S winning. Money trumps life!
9980 2018-11-21 15:57:04 Didn't Trump just praise Saudi Arabia on Twitter for bringing down oil prices?
9981 2018-11-21 15:57:04 My confusion?  Simple. Spilling oil in water. Not good. Pouring untreated waste into water. Not good. One bad action has no ability to permit another bad action.
9982 2018-11-21 15:56:57 A murdered Journalist is okay if it means lower oil....@realDonaldTrump is pathetic
9983 2018-11-21 15:56:56 얘쁜 구림............그림이 꼮........얘뻐야 할 이유가...........이쓸카.....................?
9984 2018-11-21 15:56:56 Nah. It's people/neighborhoods encroaching on forests that've been burning like they are supposed to for thousands of yrs & yes forest management is key but has nothing to do with bowing to enviro's. If you're worried about bowing wait til you hear about Zinke & oil/gas companies
9985 2018-11-21 15:56:55 #Traitors and yesterday Mr. Poodle @realDonaldTrump started to dismember the Frist Amendment, not standing up for #Khashoggi or anyone's right to Free Speech until the price of oil was lowered and overseas sales unshaken. Damn him setting a price on Amerian principles!!!
9986 2018-11-21 15:56:55 1. Saw no tax cut.
2. No thanks, to @POTUS, Oil or Saudi Arabia, is deserved.
3. Go "lower" on your own! Don't take our country with you.
4. Liar, Bully, Faker, Fool, Anti-Democratic, Big, Big Mistake!
9987 2018-11-21 15:56:54 Donald Trump has just tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to 'a big Tax Cut for America and the World!' In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia. CBC news
9988 2018-11-21 15:56:52 You mean like: "Artificially low oil prices stuffs up local production of oil in particular shale oil that would mean keeping US money in the US and not sending it off shore to a foreign government that is acting to dump their product killing American producers"
9989 2018-11-21 15:56:51 Label expansion will likely happen but with lingering doubts on mechanism of action and placebo inertia, not sure we're helping patients by adding a 200$/mo drug that causes diarrhea. Should we limit Vascepa to patients with high TG? Thoughts on corn oil with Epanova in STRENGTH?

9993 2018-11-21 15:56:35 Twitter Erupts Over Donald Trump's Low Oil Price 'Thank You' To Saudi Arabia 
Freedom of Press must be revoked!!!
9994 2018-11-21 15:56:29 Oil has nothing to do with it. We have a surplus.
9995 2018-11-21 15:56:18 But my point was that I bet there's significant overlap btwn anti-vaxxers and climate change deniers, despite that (as you rightly point out) the two issues are unrelated, and the ppl immediately impacted represent different subsets of the population (oil execs vs. parents).
9996 2018-11-21 15:56:17 Mr. Trump, are you actually aware that Canada is your biggest oil supplier at 40% of your oil over Saudi's 11%? just saying.
9997 2018-11-21 15:56:14 Are you kidding me!!! Instead of holding them accountable you're thanking them??? First it was weapons and now oil. Forgive me if I don't want the bad guys to have weapons. We need a strong president who'll stand up to evil. That's clearly not you!!! You're a disgrace!
9998 2018-11-21 15:56:12 So, human rights violations don’t matter as long as oil prices lower?  Got it. Do you even realize that this will be your legacy?
9999 2018-11-21 15:56:05 tRump tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to 'a big Tax Cut for America and the World!' In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
10000 2018-11-21 15:56:04 So @potus made a deal with the Saudis to lower oil prices in exchange for our values, democracy and our human rights.  Pretty disgusting.
10001 2018-11-21 15:56:03 People need to stop with the castor oil in general. Idk what kind of midwives these girls are going to but seems like a bad call 
10002 2018-11-21 15:56:01 I would even go so far as to say it's more a replacement for oven-cooking many things, as opposed to deep-frying. Without the oil for the food to absorb, it doesn't really come out that addictively greasy way anyway. Just crisper/crunchier on the surface
10003 2018-11-21 15:56:00 Not to mention how we always cower before OPEC. Dependence on oil is a weakness & keeps us from getting tough with human rights violators like the Saudis. The #energytransition will be good for the world. Let the #rEVolution continue, ride the lighting, drive #EVs.
10004 2018-11-21 15:55:59 I did some research, but can’t figure out how to truly identify which gas companies to boycott because they get oil from the Saudis. Oil companies use middle men & so Russian oil might actually be Saudi oil. We can really put our own interest upfront by shopping for American gas.
10005 2018-11-21 15:55:56 @FoxNews America produces most of it’s own oil. Saudi Arabia is more dependent on US then reverse.
How much Trump owes the Saudis????
10006 2018-11-21 15:55:54 So sad that @POTUS doesn't know America does not need Saudi oil. NYMEX was never $82. Lower demand, higher stockpiles = lower per barrel $.  Looks like daddy bought your @Wharton degree.
10007 2018-11-21 15:55:53 #hydesmith mississippi senator.  Really?  It’s 2018.  She wraps herself in Confederate flag, talks as if those were the good oil’ days, jokes about lynching, and you think her being your senator is a good thing?  No, it’s not in your best interest, #Mississippi. No way.
10008 2018-11-21 15:55:53 Listen here Pumpkin Head, if that even is your real name: Trump is the master of the Art of the Deal, remember? For every American journalist that gets murdered in cold blood within a consulate, we get a stamp. 6 more and we get a free coffee with our cheap oil. #WINNNNNNING

10010 2018-11-21 15:55:50 Another fun fact:

About 100 countries produce crude oil. In 2017, 48% of the world's total crude oil production came from five countries:

Russia—13%
Saudi Arabia—13%
United States—12%
Iraq—6%
Iran—5%
10011 2018-11-21 15:55:48 Add oil Rambo, support from Hong Kong
10012 2018-11-21 15:55:37 Yeah, it’s cool. We don’t mind that you killed an American resident who was a Washington Post columnist so long as you give use oil at a lower price. Hell, why don’t you kill a few more as long as you’re going to lower your prices even further!
10013 2018-11-21 15:55:35 Stable Genius - are you aware the US only imports 9% of its oil from SA? So even material price drops by SA only have minimal change in prices at the pump.
