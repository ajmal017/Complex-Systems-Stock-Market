1 2018-10-24 23:58:37 Point is bumpstocking is a shooting technique, not an “object.” Bumpstocking can be hard in your muscles, so “bump stocks” were sold to reduce stress, like CopperFit.  The technique can’t be and isn’t banned. Anyone may bump stock.
2 2018-10-24 23:58:24 You clearly do not own stocks.
3 2018-10-24 23:58:18 yeah probably too early to tell, although the bigger the size of the market the more I assume it's connected in some way with the other markets.. crypto hasn't hit big size yet, but it would be interesting to see if a selloff in stocks will lead to people reducing risk in crypto.
4 2018-10-24 23:58:08 Stocks would still be on the up if it wasn't for Crooked Hillary's emails.
5 2018-10-24 23:57:31 Here’s an idea raise taxes on gun, ammo, bump stocks etc 40-50 percent.  Keep your guns tax the hell out it.  My beer, liquor, cigars and gas are taxed to hell.  Tax the second amendment baby
6 2018-10-24 23:57:22 Pfft, AMZN only came down 100 points, not enough volatility, I'mma play them penny stocks.

8 2018-10-24 23:57:15 Really? Any proven facts, or another tweet to look smart and “know” what others don’t? So you saying for couple of Alts to go up, people have to sell their stocks? Come on man, you can do better :)
9 2018-10-24 23:56:36 alot of selling off of stocks. You didn't report the 100 times it hit record highs

40 2018-10-24 23:53:15 #RonDeSantis asked about banning gun bump stocks, does not answer the question, talks about other issues.   @RonDeSantisFL @AndrewGillum #FLGovernorDebate #AndrewGillum #FLGovDebate
41 2018-10-24 23:53:08 We do not have a constitutionally mandated right to bear bump stocks.
42 2018-10-24 23:53:04 Correct me if I’m wrong but Btc was born in an upwards trending stock market and has never known anything else. Recent price action says some of us believe it is a correlating asset. If the downwards movement in stocks continues into a bear market we’ll know for sure.
43 2018-10-24 23:52:52 DeSantis isn't answering why he is opposed to banning bump stocks. Crickets.
44 2018-10-24 23:52:45 My farmers insurance agent wants me to help him get into bitcoin, he is getting out of stocks, bitcoin will be the new money for the whole world, were moving forward not backwards. We didnt have bitcoin for the last crisis now we do, it was born from the last crisis.
45 2018-10-24 23:52:44 So am I the only one who thinks the new crop of stable coins ( $TUSD $USDC $GUSD ) are really designed to allow for automated delivery of stock dividends once stocks are inevitably tokenized? Seems like a critical use case we'll probably see before the end of 2019. $Crypto
46 2018-10-24 23:52:41 Oh stop it @jimcramer, Trump has nothing to do with this selloff. Housing stocks are in crash mode, autos getting crushed, banks dropping like a stone all while @federalreserve and Powell are hell bent on getting rates higher and crashing the market just so they’ll have ammo.

50 2018-10-24 23:50:45 G'morning. On @BloombergTV 
- Stocks smashed overnight, Asia set to follow
- Tesla earnings help Musk leave go-private fiasco in rear-view 
- Suspected explosives sent to Clinton, Obama, CNN
51 2018-10-24 23:50:16 Gun Control?

@RepBuddyCarter says he met with education stakeholders after Parkland. They opposed arming teachers. They favor doing something on mental health. No mention of gun control. 

@LisaRingGA01 calls for universal background checks and banning bump stocks.
52 2018-10-24 23:49:46 but arent all stocks going down now due to worldwide trade stats? These are big players, ofc they’d be impacted. with their huge investements though, once stocks are up— they’d gain more.
53 2018-10-24 23:49:31 I'm truly thank you guys who order my space plush, it sold out even before PO ends.

I'll update you again if I have any left in stocks!
54 2018-10-24 23:49:24 Lots of traders saying weakness will continue and an even bigger puke is coming. A smaller % saying that the correction is over done. It's times like these I'm glad I have strict rules to follow. #quanttrading #stocks
55 2018-10-24 23:49:05 Damn...tech stocks on Wall street this week, RIP gainz #AMD #NVDA, time to play the shorts game till it stabilizes 
56 2018-10-24 23:48:50 Notice how-as I predicted before the first ugly window-the big drop-the stocks u want now r not the ones u thought were good before this-NOT a"rotation":a completely different"landscape.
57 2018-10-24 23:48:37 José, el concepto del cálculo es el correcto. Hay un par de datos a corregir de acuerdo a los datos oficiales: importaciones estimadas = 4 MT y stocks en instalaciones comerciales, yo veo en la web al 30/09 = 11.5 MT.
58 2018-10-24 23:48:35 Finviz is reversed. I do a quick scan every night to see if anything jumps out for the next day. One of my parameters is at least 3m vol on the day. Normally I see 25-40 charts on the "gainers" side with at least 3m vol. Today there was 5. The losers had almost 50, #stocks #bears
59 2018-10-24 23:48:21 Stocks fell another 500, wiping out all gains for the year. Since Trump won't be bragging about that at his rally, he'll have time for a message of unity and tolerance and...
...oh, who am I kidding, he'll be blaming Dems for sending themselves pipe bombs.
60 2018-10-24 23:47:51 I left out the part about stocks being down 600 points the day it happened
61 2018-10-24 23:47:24 Statistics don't lie. #Nike stocks are soaring!
62 2018-10-24 23:47:10 @AskRobinhood I don't understand why when I sell my stocks I become negative in my balance? I already lost money on the stocks that I overlayed for? why am I not receiving the money I cashed out on? In fact why is show - the money I sold my stocks for? EVERYONE PLEASE BE WEARY.
63 2018-10-24 23:47:03 Stocks are too expensive, time to sell, period.
64 2018-10-24 23:45:59 agree, the ruck stocks look slim if TBELL goes down. Draper still developing.
65 2018-10-24 23:45:40 Mine is 60 stocks, 40 Tesla so I did ok
66 2018-10-24 23:45:21 Jack why suspend such a beautiful woman who speaks for America you’d better change your mind cause your stocks will take a major dive if this keeps happening guaranteed
67 2018-10-24 23:45:20 Looking for a "rubber band snapback" in stocks tomorrow.  All my breadth indicators are at the bottom of their extreme ranges.
68 2018-10-24 23:44:45 Thanks!! It’s great getting places to Accept for Payments, the more the public sees Cryptos are meant for Payments the less they will view them like stocks.
69 2018-10-24 23:43:17 Jim, THIS selloff will the proverbial " pause/correction that refreshes".  The US economy is strong but the US media (like CNBC Fastmoney) has overhyped stocks to high valuations in the fast of rising rates which I OFTEN opposed. And now the media attacks Trump? HE WAS RIGHT!!
70 2018-10-24 23:43:12 Nasdaq dropped a whopping 4.4%, the largest single day drop since 2011. Tech stocks are being hammered on multiple fronts, not to mention slow real estate sales, rising mortgage rates and retail costs. Methinks we haven't the bottom yet.
71 2018-10-24 23:42:57 I always find it weird when I’m updating my medical plan and 401K and Stocks this time of the year.. Makes me feel so old...
72 2018-10-24 23:42:16 It’s time to buy tech stocks

73 2018-10-24 23:41:39 Survey of American public by @justcapital_ revealed that worker treatment is critical to high public opinion of corporations. Yet stocks get pummeled when companies announce pay raises. This is a problem. -Warren Valdmanis of @BainCapVC at #socap18 @SOCAPmarkets #impactinvesting
74 2018-10-24 23:41:31 Legalize bump stocks until the INVASION is over.
75 2018-10-24 23:41:17 Anyone buy any great #stocks for cheap today?  I was looking at $AYI 2019 puts and patiently waiting for $WYNN to get into my buy zone.  #investing #DOW #NASDAQ
76 2018-10-24 23:41:16 Mining stocks = waste of time
77 2018-10-24 23:41:05 @jimcramer I am holding MSFT and NOW calls expiring 11/02. What's your view on these stocks? Thanks.
78 2018-10-24 23:40:25 People that own housing in general are targeted. The tax and all others are meant to punish homeowners to the cheers of the poor by making the "man" suffer. Housing is most peoples biggest investment, a stock, and the government is trying to kill your stocks to make others happy.
79 2018-10-24 23:39:35 GDP Friday. Could it be stocks are pricing in a poor #? Bounce before or after that major event? Typically techs lead fundamentals
80 2018-10-24 23:39:06 Trump has been able to get away w  nonstop lying, attacking the press, working against minorities, LGBTQ etc. his only goal: $$

For the 1%, big business, and of course for himself.

So it would be beautiful irony that stocks continue to crash until Nov 6 — & lead to a blue wave
81 2018-10-24 23:38:16 The problem is in thinking that Dems are against gun rights as a whole. Most are against semi-automatics, especially AR-15s, bump stocks, and FOR background checks, waiting periods, training & licensing. Many libs like guns. 80% of both parties agree on common sense gun laws.
82 2018-10-24 23:37:12 If America really cared we never would have catch and release .  That s a political accuse for cheap labor .  With time quality is going to go down and blue workers native will cease to exist.  Socialism is coming  watch property values and stocks then .  10 15 year prediction
83 2018-10-24 23:35:47 How do you love those stocks 
84 2018-10-24 23:35:27 "Really? Because it's the right wing that stocks up on guns like psychos." What happened?
85 2018-10-24 23:35:21 You'd be better off investing in stocks with more than that of course.
86 2018-10-24 23:35:07 Don't you love those stocks
87 2018-10-24 23:35:06 Wow I was so busy scanning for crap penny stocks I didn’t notice the Dow ended down over 600 points $QQQ $DIA $SPY
88 2018-10-24 23:33:21 The chip stocks are no longer pulling back or dropping...they are crashing and NEED to finish this and one can buy them. Maybe 1 more nice gap down. Thoughts? @jimcramer @petenajarian @jonnajarian @ReformedBroker @MarkNewtonCMT @terranovajoe @michaelsantoli

92 2018-10-24 23:29:58 My stocks just plumbed
93 2018-10-24 23:28:41 It skyrocketed during trumps first year due to investor confidence but unrealistic to expect it to rise at that rate every year. The stock markets make very few rich. I’m for business friendly government and jobs. And if stocks raise 10% between now and my retirement in 20yrs 
94 2018-10-24 23:28:33 How bout them stocks?

And how bout them Sox?
95 2018-10-24 23:28:28 Any GOOD App recommendations for stocks. I’m about to tapp in
96 2018-10-24 23:27:27 Invaders must be shot as they cross the line. Employers of illegals must be put in jail. Whiners must be put in stocks
97 2018-10-24 23:27:25 They have calculated that if he took his inheritance and just put it in a safe treasury bond and blue chip stocks, he would be worth 2 billion dollars by not touching it. In the end he had to scam everyone to get to 2 billion
98 2018-10-24 23:26:34 What’s ur advise on the 200 day mark that stocks are in free fall... look at NFLX and MU ... and goog
99 2018-10-24 23:26:33 Central Banks Firehose money printing broke the seesaw of bonds and stocks.
100 2018-10-24 23:26:06 Most stocks are in 401k’s ... owned by the 98%.
101 2018-10-24 23:25:55 Damn my stocks are tanking

DOW dropped 600 points 
102 2018-10-24 23:25:20 Market is not down. Just Shit is down. KO is up, MCD is up.. quality, cash generating stocks are all..up. only shit is down.
103 2018-10-24 23:24:57 Doesn’t work that way. The billionaires have enough cash to swoop in and buy stocks cheap when the market is down.
104 2018-10-24 23:24:10 Could be why the Twitter, FB, Google, Apple, Amazon stocks all fell today...Repubs are selling off and getting out of products which are censoring...and not support free speech
105 2018-10-24 23:23:21 Where are those stupids who chanted the purchase of shit stocks with market cap of 5 million, pe of 160 and negative cash... Where are you
106 2018-10-24 23:22:34 @jimcramer STZ constellation direct or similar competitor is DIAGEO both stocks are down YTD right now but very similarities (they every thought about doing and M&A).
107 2018-10-24 23:22:07 Always tough these markets. Especially when stocks revert pullback after a very strong run up prior. That is why our objective is to hold 15 - 20 companies to avoid over reliance on 1-2. Hold some exciting, some boring, big/small etc. All goes to help riding out tough times.
108 2018-10-24 23:21:49 Bonds not blinking is a balls on major signal. Stocks lower before bonds turn.
109 2018-10-24 23:21:46 Actually I never criticized stocks much because of Obama but I feel like investors hoarded more money due to his not overly business friendly beliefs. November 6 2016 Dow Jones was 17910 today it is 24584. It rose at breakneck speeds and I imagine some are cashing out on gains.
110 2018-10-24 23:21:35 Stocks are falling just like the corrupt @POTUS tax legislation!

Trump still hasn’t learned “you can’t make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear”.

Now he’s blaming the Fed for his ignorant decisions, which were based on his gut rather than intelligence!  
111 2018-10-24 23:21:15 Thanks Fred for informing about the semiconductor bubble. 25 million stocks in insider AMD sales in last three months. Today we have seen the result. Keep up the good work.
112 2018-10-24 23:20:49 Yes, a lot of 8%, 9% drops.  Capitulation.  Problem is, can have multiple days of capitulation depending on how much liquidation needs to be done. And stocks are still overvalued.
113 2018-10-24 23:20:42 Really? Because it's the right wing that stocks up on guns like psychos.
114 2018-10-24 23:20:11 Recession is coming- you can feel it in the stocks. #StockMarket
115 2018-10-24 23:19:45 been watching my stocks all week. 

need to lab more got dammit.
116 2018-10-24 23:19:43 @lwvct @SenGeorgeLogan calls our ban on bump stocks “feel good” legislation.
117 2018-10-24 23:19:03 The best business advice I have ever heard is that don't play the penny stocks.
118 2018-10-24 23:18:51 as I diligently study on how to prescribe suboxone just realized I own stocks in titan pharmaceutical.
119 2018-10-24 23:18:46 Market’s down 10% from highs (highs not seen if not for Trump), you’re down 52 grand?  High risk market plan or half a million in the market.

Fed’s been popping the balloon the last 2 years by raising rates.  You’ll see 20-30% pullback at some point

Rates up = bonds/stocks down
120 2018-10-24 23:18:33 choose your stocks carefully buddy, this is MY WIFE you're talking about
121 2018-10-24 23:18:31 It's just a good time to buy stocks cheap.
122 2018-10-24 23:18:05 You said tech was driving everything up. So I want to know exactly why it is driving EVERYTHING up not only growth stocks :)
123 2018-10-24 23:17:31 Just ran into one of my coworkers in public rocking socks and stocks lol I hate myself
124 2018-10-24 23:17:19 ahh merci.. yeah I think the bigger crypto gets the bigger the correlation. There were a few days where btc bounced on the first big dip on stocks from like a few months ago and 2015-2017 was mostly a bullrun, so could be interesting to watch the correlation for 2018.
125 2018-10-24 23:16:41 If only she’d done the same with her Apple stocks
126 2018-10-24 23:15:34 1/I partially agree w/ u on the passive incomes.
And here’s why, just over 50% of Americans own stocks, so passive income tax cuts help Ave citizens. And for the Ave citizen that invests, that $ has already been taxed, really unfair that his earnings should be taxed a 2nd time
127 2018-10-24 23:15:23 I said Tech was leading the general market ... the general market indices are SPX, NDX. The majority of the performance was driven to a large extend by these handful FAANG stocks performance and this was THE leading indicator for a long time. Didn't you know ??
128 2018-10-24 23:15:04 Nope. Buy cheap stocks, buy cheap crypto.
129 2018-10-24 23:14:41 I hate being conspiratorial but I can’t help but think there is a directive to bomb the qqq and spy’s with puts knowing it could not handle it. Several stocks I own had 50 percent of average volume today
130 2018-10-24 23:14:33 Always stocks xD but yeah. Everything goes up and down.
131 2018-10-24 23:13:57 I #BlameTrump for the #WorstMonth for stocks since 2010 ... #WaytoSuck ... We would probably all #BeBetterOff if you just stay in #MaraLago and #Golf ... Oh wait ... #Nevermind

134 2018-10-24 23:13:10 Just dump your stocks and buy Bitcoin!
135 2018-10-24 23:12:58 How about those stocks, genius.
136 2018-10-24 23:12:47 1) don’t lose money in stocks ;)
137 2018-10-24 23:11:54 The move has to be swift and large; otherwise I think the strike of Powell’s put is lower than market thinks. Pick your poison for tighter us fiancial conditions: higher dollar, lower stocks, higher rates?
138 2018-10-24 23:11:49 wtf you buying? weekly calls? stocks will be fine, just keep buying

options though....lol RIP
139 2018-10-24 23:10:46 Stock market drops again, will this effect Cryptocurrencies? #stocks #cryptocurrency #Bitcoin
140 2018-10-24 23:10:07 $ESV was 50-60 until late 2014 when oil fell out of bed.  Oil is coming back strong.  ESV is 7 bucks with improving fundamentals.  
There are cheap stocks out there.
141 2018-10-24 23:10:00 Markets Plunge on Continued Growth Worries, more soft housing data, and continued worries over trade and geopolitics. AT&T missed forecasts and Texas Instruments' guidance disappointed, helping to put technology and communication services stocks as the biggest losers on the day.
142 2018-10-24 23:09:46 In most instances I'd say look at POT STOCKS in this type of market, but with POT more legitimized now, guess where you should be looking in coming days?   CRYPTO.   Yep, time for that horse to get rolling again.
143 2018-10-24 23:09:43 Isn’t candianmoney all in marijuana stocks right now?  Like in Las Vegas we pay for everything in casino chips
144 2018-10-24 23:09:41 The Nasdaq plummeted 4.4%, its worst day since Aug. 2011, as tech stocks nosedive. 

The Dow plunged 608 points, or 2.4%. The S&P 500 lost 3.1%, closing down for the 6th day in a row. Both indexes are now negative on the year.

145 2018-10-24 23:09:21 Thanks for the reply as this has caused a big debate between me and my son who are both vegan, I wasn’t aware stocks were low in wild either until reading your website. my son supports restock of wild, he is doing A levels to become a conservationist, said it all helps.
146 2018-10-24 23:09:04 what has the energy sector to do with FAANG stocks ??
147 2018-10-24 23:08:17 Listening to the Orange Man talking about Now is the time for Unity is like listening to a crackhead tell you what stocks to invest in 
148 2018-10-24 23:08:15 #What a Phony piece of Shit ! You smell like Trump , Stocks Down 600 points . Going Going Gone!
149 2018-10-24 23:08:07 Don’t think we are done with downtrend in stocks.  Expect further slide this week.
150 2018-10-24 23:07:45 This will allow blue to buy the down stocks, to sell tomorrow and fund their crap.
151 2018-10-24 23:06:50 Why were you invested in something that volatile with your whole account? These are times to start dipping into these stocks over time... don’t blame JC!
152 2018-10-24 23:06:17 I have NO plans to sell stocks this year.
153 2018-10-24 23:06:06 I've lost so much money lately in stocks it's insane lol
154 2018-10-24 23:05:36 Flying straight into crypto mid caps. Reverse fomo from stocks into things like Raven. Unprecedented
155 2018-10-24 23:05:32 Us stocks gir Gaye. Free fall now.
156 2018-10-24 23:05:29 Isn’t that just a denominator effect? Cash roughly static and stocks up ==>cash/assets down?
157 2018-10-24 23:05:03 OhPleez
I don't believe for a second you have stocks- you can barely put a sentence together ... go clean your room.
158 2018-10-24 23:04:01 Have you noticed what is happening to the stocks of other “technology” companies lately? $TSLA
159 2018-10-24 23:03:58 Are you still long US stocks?
160 2018-10-24 23:03:50 Stocks crash Cryptos 
161 2018-10-24 23:03:24 And stocks just lost the entire year’s gain today.
162 2018-10-24 23:02:30 It’s varieties on vine spacings and post spacings. But I would say with own roots it’s 50% then less again with root stocks. I’m using about 1000L of water in 30ac
163 2018-10-24 23:02:11 Businesses can use that extra money to generate jobs but it’s their choice if they want to or not and so far they haven’t. Evidenced by the larger than Obama era numbers when it comes to outsourcing. Instead what they did was use that money to buy back their stocks.
164 2018-10-24 23:01:41 Stocks are a liquid asset, education is not. Can’t trade class credits for food or rent money.
165 2018-10-24 23:00:49 Uranium stocks will are in the process of taking another beating...  still ways away before that sector takes off.
166 2018-10-24 23:00:46 Sure, dump your money into something worthless. Might as well buy penny stocks
167 2018-10-24 22:59:37 for those with the bread to buy stocks!
168 2018-10-24 22:59:22 bad freaking day for pot stocks too...
169 2018-10-24 22:59:11 I care! Bc I know republicans that only vote R and support djt bc of how the stocks are doing.  Not because they're that invested; no, they think it's an accurate representation of the fucking economy.  No matter how many pictures you draw, they're morons.  But THIS may be heard.

171 2018-10-24 22:57:36 We have better small forward stocks than in a while imo, just because Linc and Gregson barely counted and Narkle/Jones/Fogarty/Miers/Parfitt/Cocky are improving. As for talls I think the club has acknowledged they need to reset a bit - hopefully Kreuger and Sav can develop.
172 2018-10-24 22:57:21 I don't think current macro environment is all bad.  (less easy money).  
The S&P might go lower, but bigger story is easy money has been replaced worldwide by aggressive fiscal policy, which might spark value rotation into commodities and related stocks.  
They are dirt cheap.
173 2018-10-24 22:56:58 Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Apple. The Globalist stocks that brought the market down. This is what Soros does to Countries to bring them down. The American People need to stand strong. The next two weeks are going to be brutal. They are all in.
174 2018-10-24 22:56:36 It’s only your claim that advocates it’s been violated. Regardless of the monetization of your content does not give you say in that contract. I mean do you have stocks in twitter? No..then your opinion is null.
175 2018-10-24 22:56:28 Mr. Kass,  you are inciting even more violence for only call out one side,
please stick to stocks
176 2018-10-24 22:56:19 wich broker you use for doing stocks?
177 2018-10-24 22:56:19 Thanks Chris. I follow a handful of clever minds on twitter and YouTube for perspective on crypto markets. Not many I know worth following beyond you on stocks. Can you recommend any peers worth following?
178 2018-10-24 22:56:01 that is not indicative of a booming economy. certainly not a booming national economy. wages are stagnant or dropping. the gdp is only a measure of stocks, not income, sales, etc.
179 2018-10-24 22:55:19 Stocks are confusing. Thank goodness for Chris Rolling and his explanation skills

182 2018-10-24 22:53:46 I made $.09 today selling penny stocks! Guess I’ve got to figure out how to launder it so the government doesn’t find out too.
183 2018-10-24 22:53:44 It s not markets fault that  people loaded shit stocks that traded at PE 160 and never generated 1 dollar free cash. Time to  Suck it up now
184 2018-10-24 22:53:27 Vous devriez changer de gestionnaire pour vos medias sociaux... aucune interaction ! Où sont les stocks ? Et comment justifier aucun magasin à Sherbrooke, la 6e plus grande ville du Quebec, pour desservir  l’Estrie ?! @La_SQDC
185 2018-10-24 22:52:22 Everyone at work was like “why you doing stocks that’s stupid” then I told them how much I made these past 2 days and they were like “Show me how to do them” 
186 2018-10-24 22:52:04 Scariest factor of the selloff in stocks recently, the 52 week low list is filled with deep cyclicals.  Not a good leading indicator
187 2018-10-24 22:51:54 Those pesky bump stocks that make it a breeze to shoot those capacity bullets out of that ultra high capacity clipazines sp accurately.
188 2018-10-24 22:51:47 Rich democrats selling off stocks to make market crash. Vote Republican, stop the madness, and keep America Great!
189 2018-10-24 22:51:22 @capitangains they followed the “network” of successful cannabis holders on twitter you guys are like 10 people... I don’t know if you guys got lucky and got the attention with it but I think this might truly be the end of cannabis stocks. Too much people are in.
190 2018-10-24 22:51:13 @realdonadtrump  Here you go, you failed POS:  "Stocks tumbled Wednesday, sending the Dow and S&P into the red for the year."
191 2018-10-24 22:50:30 Janet is a tengu who trades stocks for fun.
192 2018-10-24 22:49:51 Get stocks in solid high paying dividend companies rather than mutual funds which profit banks and take from your profits about 3-5% each year in fees :) Stocks.. only $10 / transaction.. buy once.. hold for years.. make money don't pay it. :)
193 2018-10-24 22:49:28 Maybe this one will last? I just hope @Rosie future wife stocks up on anti-depression & diet pills!
194 2018-10-24 22:48:58 Hi Chris. A chunk of my superannuation (like your 401 in the U.S) exposed to stocks. I’ve been watching your commentary with great interest. Thanks so much for sharing your insights. I’m so uncertain about whether this is the big drop or leading to a bounce. 
195 2018-10-24 22:48:44 The semiconductor space is getting hammered. My favorite approach to making money in the market is to find the best stocks in beaten down sectors. Now, #AMAT $AMAT is my absolute favorite stock. It is selling at a tremendous discount. My second favorite pick, #LRCX $LRCX
196 2018-10-24 22:48:35 U.S. stocks tumbled again, with the S.&P. 500 down more than 3 % amid a run of selling that has wiped out all market gains for the year!!! 
and to think Trump says only reason to vote Democrat is 'if you're tired of winning'  NYSE obviously is tired of winning.
197 2018-10-24 22:47:40 A more frightening indication is how much the smidcap stocks have taken a dive. And we haven’t seen stabilization in those yet. It’s all about $XLP & $XLU unless $AMZN & $GOOGL blow away expectations tomorrow.
198 2018-10-24 22:46:56 @JustinPulitzer wow so many stocks getting nailed crazy day - plus some big earnings like $AMZN coming up- which CNBC @jimcramer said is the "key" to this market going to be an interesting day tommorow
199 2018-10-24 22:46:49 The ferocity of the plunge has been stunning. Particularly stocks like $NVDA. I was just making a lot on calls at ATH of $292 a few weeks ago, now it's down $100 from there.
200 2018-10-24 22:46:29 You are losing on the economic front-stocks down over 2000 points in 2018-all gains erased...debt up by bogus tax cut $1.7 trillion-you don’t know what the fuck you are doing your lucky Obama left a well entrenched growth economy and you have found a way the trash it-you’re toast
201 2018-10-24 22:46:13 Time to buy stocks then....
202 2018-10-24 22:46:07 was predicted that when $stocks start crashing, we can expect absolutely abnormal volatility in #cryptocurrency markets.
203 2018-10-24 22:44:54 The so called Big 3 agencies stocks will drop even further as they spend too much money to go chasing after a piece of the #BTS pie in the US and Europe. It will be interesting to see what kind of financial trouble this will bring to them.
204 2018-10-24 22:44:36 CNBC saying to sell tech every other word, I’m not even exaggerating...media does drive sentiment and sentiment drives some portion of stocks
205 2018-10-24 22:44:12 My 18yr old cousin started investing in  stocks; I'm trying to get my niece to learn about stock trading. 

Also, marketing and branding is a hot area! 
206 2018-10-24 22:44:11 Me too, probably looking at some gold stocks but no pos yet
207 2018-10-24 22:43:47 @jimcramer Thousands of baby boomers retire every day. They are going to begin drawing down their 401(k)s. In addition they are likely to be selling stocks in favor of bonds to generate income. How might this affect the performance of the stock markets going forward? #MadTweets
208 2018-10-24 22:43:22 AP: Stocks plunge again, wiping out gains for the year; technology swoon pulls Nasdaq 12 percent below August peak.

Only one problem, Black America. Everything been purchased. You're late. 1619 set in Stone. 2nd floor firm 1719. 3th Floor solid as Rock 1819. 4th floor, 1919, house strong. Only buy stocks in master's house-2019. Invest with me Boys & Girls. Bank with me.
FREE?
210 2018-10-24 22:42:23 truth is markets are independent of fed and imf and anyone money is fixed to fed buying point when gold and silver fall from grace and everyone needs to cash out to chase other stocks
211 2018-10-24 22:42:17 All the peeps in Silicon Valley are wailing because they are overexposed to tech stocks like they've never heard of portfolio theory...
212 2018-10-24 22:40:48 @DuckDuckGo Been trying to switch over. On Google I get stock charts right after a search. Anything similar on Duck? Or do you recommend a bang search for stocks?
213 2018-10-24 22:40:31 OK first of all no one should be actively buying stocks because you can't beat the market; low cost index fund is the way to go and don't look at it till retirement
214 2018-10-24 22:40:27 "Stocks are still up over the last 12 months," said the analyst who made fun of the #crypto people
215 2018-10-24 22:40:00 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
216 2018-10-24 22:39:11 You mean the largest military in the world isn't enough?

$700+B this year alone on the military and folks w/ bump stocks are keeping us safe?

Ur joking, right?
217 2018-10-24 22:38:07 are you kidding? Stocks HAVE tanked....watch the news.
218 2018-10-24 22:37:35 Wall Street’te Ekim şoku! Dow 600 puan çakıldı; yıllık kazançlarını verdi.Dow erases gains for the year, tumbles more than 600 points as stocks extend October swoon #DowJones #StockMarket #Stocks
219 2018-10-24 22:37:13 $SPY & $QQQ (Disruption Technological stocks) LEAPs of fact or LEAPs of faith. I’ll be dollar cost averaging in on all my position’s until I see a recession on the horizons.
220 2018-10-24 22:37:13 Hey! Trump, ask the Americans how they feel about their retirement accounts today?  U.S. Stocks plunged erasing the Dow and S&P 500's gains for the year, as forecasts from chipmakers and weak home sales data fueled jitters about economic and profit growth.
221 2018-10-24 22:36:29 You know the POTUS is selling all his stocks now as he knows the economy and stocks are not doing as well as he is telling his followers. Seems a bit like insider trading since only a few know what damage is being done.  Good thing I am smart enough and took my $$ and ran. GOLD!
222 2018-10-24 22:34:00 Since I’ve been betting against stocks it’s flipped... come to daddy Jennifer!
223 2018-10-24 22:33:56 pls give a honey update as there has been some trouble with local hives and I need to live a lil vicariously bc local stocks are low
224 2018-10-24 22:33:30 Recession stocks
225 2018-10-24 22:32:53 Yup. I said that even on the top the percent of stocks is 10% different. 
226 2018-10-24 22:32:45 Thank God I didn't let my husband put our money from his retirement annuity into an IRA rollover that would have been in stocks in July. We would have lost a bundle....At least we are making 3% right now. It's better than losing money at this point.
227 2018-10-24 22:32:42 no shit!!  but thanks for promoting pot stocks....must be quite profitable to tout outrageously overpriced pot deals to innocent investors.  Shame on you and your bullshit recommendations.
228 2018-10-24 22:32:22 I heard this means stocks are on sale today
229 2018-10-24 22:32:18 These heavily manipulated Tesla numbers don’t mean a damn thing if the market breaks. The stocks a joke. Auto sales are slowing.
230 2018-10-24 22:32:18 Stocks are down 2.5%
231 2018-10-24 22:31:51 @realDonaldTrump #TrumpCrash   BREAKING: Stocks plunge again, wiping out gains for the year;
232 2018-10-24 22:31:43 Don’t forget; holding quality stocks over the long term is the best way to make money in the stock market. Keep your focused on the bigger picture.
233 2018-10-24 22:31:05 When ya say tech stocks, I associate companies like Microsoft (up), Apple (up), IBM (up)...I don't associate "tech" companies like Facebook (down) or Google(down)
...those aren't companies that provide a service...they are companies that steal time and life.
234 2018-10-24 22:30:39 oh lawd my stocks tanking. wdf
235 2018-10-24 22:30:36 Wild guess: you don’t own any stocks or have any personal wealth tied to the market. Am I wrong?
236 2018-10-24 22:30:33 Yeah not seeing much winning going on. Wages flat, stocks plunging, everything costs more, terrorists sending bombs around, etc. And McConnell telling people he will be cutting social security and Medicare to pay for the 1% tax cuts. #VoteBlue.
237 2018-10-24 22:30:28 Worried about the day to day price of stocks you own? The stock market might not be for you.
238 2018-10-24 22:30:10 Try The Estates if you haven’t yet. It’s not stocks, but it’s bidding with area control. It’s super mean in the best way possible. Easy rules, deep strategy.
239 2018-10-24 22:29:51 Stocks are down because institutions want them to be down.
240 2018-10-24 22:29:34 That’s why you have short term money in short term products, checking savings money market cds bonds. Long term stocks will out perform all of them short terms stocks can be more volatile. Use the three bucket approach.
241 2018-10-24 22:29:23 Bitcoin is a stellar uncorrleated asset... to stocks, bonds, and gold. Every financial institution in the world that is into modern portfolio theory is going to want a piece of Bitcoin for that reason alone... let alone how everyone in the world already feels about the Fed.
242 2018-10-24 22:29:22 Gary, I said the same thing on my page. People were saying companies were going to pay people better wage. I said hogwash. There buying back their stocks and giving themselves bonuses. Reagan Trickle economics does not work. It's a failed theory.
243 2018-10-24 22:29:12 Our apologies, Arulmurugan. We currently do not have any news regarding the stock availability. Please provide your email under the "Notify Me" section so that we can send you an email once stocks are back. Your patience is appreciated.
244 2018-10-24 22:28:27 A lot of defensive analysists tonight. Looking forward to the upside tomorrow on some positive earnings from #MSFT & even #TSLA. Going long on #NFLX for growth.

245 2018-10-24 22:28:27 Stocks are falling due to fear that Democrats will win midterms and end "pro-growth policies," according to White House advisor Larry Kudlow.
246 2018-10-24 22:28:08 Tesla stocks went up more than 70 dollars

252 2018-10-24 22:26:26 They’ve jumped a school of sharks on this  FF, while the rich libs selling off their stocks, fed increasing interest rates...Soooooo obvious they’re doing anything to throw the election. Meanwhile Republicans see through the shenanigans & running to the polls
253 2018-10-24 22:25:45 Glad to see #btc staying stable while #stocks shit the bed today
254 2018-10-24 22:24:43 Agreed... This tweet tells truth to all the noobs who think they are rekt only be down 50%-95%...

Crypto will easily  go 300x - 900x or more if in the right coins at the right times in this next bull run...

I would be freaking out if I was in stocks, bonds, or mutual funds...
255 2018-10-24 22:24:29 It appears that our common enemy, Satan, is doing what he does best - instilling a spirit of fear; pipe bombs & stocks plungin. We will not be skaken, we continue to fast & pray. 2 Timothy 1:7, that the Lord did not give us a a spirit of fear, but of power, love & a sound mind.
256 2018-10-24 22:24:19 Trying to time the market is a fools game. Stocks are a long term investment, think of a business you would like to own for the rest of your life.
257 2018-10-24 22:24:16 Wtf does religion have to do with stocks?
258 2018-10-24 22:23:55 Sorry...media & tech stocks take a drop today.#MAGA

264 2018-10-24 22:22:15 I have hundreds of messages coming in asking "what do I do now? I held my stocks and I'm down big... should I sell now?" You shouldn't be in that situation!  I already answered that question way in advance. I've been Tweeting warnings since Sep 21. The market gave ample heads-up.
265 2018-10-24 22:21:44 Good thing for Trump his supporters don't know what stocks are
266 2018-10-24 22:21:04 Stocks go up, stocks go down, that's what they do. Just like the Earth's temperature, that's what the climate does. Mueller is the biggest pursuer of a conspiracy theory and all the Left believes it real. When stocks go down it is a buying opportunity.
267 2018-10-24 22:20:55 Man I don’t care about stocks , all my money is in crypto pump it
268 2018-10-24 22:20:32 2 technology stocks plummeted  on Wednesday:

270 2018-10-24 22:19:41 So funny to hear east coasters groan - stocks and socks are a normal thing on the left coast.
271 2018-10-24 22:19:40 any tips on which ETFs to go for? I've only done individual stocks thus far.
272 2018-10-24 22:18:57 @CryptoChoe does your course apply to stocks as well?
273 2018-10-24 22:18:33 i follow “trade isn’t the biggest worry” idea, but the more vocal the pres is abt the Fed, in conjunction w/ *major* FANG stocks reporting tomorrow (considering also their abnormal sensitivity 2 market conditions) run up 4 sure. VIX will be elevated. markets are boomerang-like rn
274 2018-10-24 22:18:27 $AMRN está en un proceso ajeno a los mercados , de ahí que no caiga . Supongo que habrás leído todo lo que rodea a la empresa ultimamente . El 10 de nov . Tiene la conferencia y el lunes 12 nov se Sabra en que queda todo . Aunque por ahora ya le saco un margen enorme .
275 2018-10-24 22:18:20 So then your chart would have had me get short stocks in August 2015 right?
276 2018-10-24 22:17:51 Red day #stocks
277 2018-10-24 22:17:46 Since you think you know that the right did it. I think we know your left group most likely sent these things, never intending detonation. Then the market tanked. Now the left is most likely buying all stocks to prep for rebound. Then will sell to further fund left crap.
278 2018-10-24 22:17:41 Yes girl/ is always good when you do your own thing means you’re learning / I did the same today fells good / congratulations/ cheers
279 2018-10-24 22:17:12 Cramer also said stocks would tank under Pres. Trump...
He was wrong
280 2018-10-24 22:16:59 Worst month since the financial crisis of 2008.  Money fleeing stocks and bonds.  Wall Street opening crypto exchanges over the next two months such as @DigitalAssets and @Bakkt I wonder where all that money will go? I wonder if Wall Street wants a Plan B?
281 2018-10-24 22:16:53 hey now, lets see, lets see how our stocks are doing since Trump's tax break for the wealthy....hmmm. Wait, now, um, this shows I've actually LOST money...this can't be right, I was told this was the Trump economy!
282 2018-10-24 22:15:44 So my wife goes to Walmart to buy visine the day after pot gets legalized here in Canada. Guess what, sold out. Goes today to buy some, minimal supplies. I should have bought Visine stocks. Coincidence?
283 2018-10-24 22:14:12 Fingers crossed- one issue is companies buying back their own stocks are mostly in their “quiet periods” bec of reporting earnings. When they come back in that should help
284 2018-10-24 22:13:47 And how do we know foreign countries didn’t buy stocks through Americans?
285 2018-10-24 22:12:49 Yeah it's a bear market with pullback based around the price to earning ratio of tech stocks being awful
286 2018-10-24 22:12:40 If that does happen, it willl only help those who own stocks and not   hardworking and unpaid people.

291 2018-10-24 22:10:35 Microsoft shares have done pretty well this year, beating expectations on revenue as well. Earnings from LinkedIn are clearly paying off. Azure growth has slowed but that reflects a consolidation of effort rather than aggressive growth. Tech stocks are always interesting.
292 2018-10-24 22:10:11 In down markets like this, we all need to remember Warren Buffett’s quote. 

“Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.”

Don’t be scared of a down market, take advantage of it and plow through the other side like a tank of discounted stocks! 
293 2018-10-24 22:09:46 Jim. Any insight into how much machine algorithms are driving the market?  Create a down day, collect on short position.  Drive action in individual stocks and profit.  Etc.  They only need to win 51pct of time to make money?  Does the small investor need to worry?
294 2018-10-24 22:09:42 Anyone who has been listening to that 'tard has been setting fire to money, month on month. #FFWD one of the biggest dog stocks on AIM 
295 2018-10-24 22:09:29 STOCKS: Even though Boeing and other corporation reported awesome  earning today, the DOW dropped 600 points.  This is especially upsetting  to trump and republicans who were counting on a booming stock market so  "trumpee dumpee" could brag.
296 2018-10-24 22:09:19 no, growth stocks on artificial low interest rate environment (for production/lending/consumer spending etc)
297 2018-10-24 22:09:08 fuck the stocks are going dOwn maybe its time for another great depression. we goin down streaks i guess
298 2018-10-24 22:08:47 Sector rotation was wild in the stocks meltdown today. 3 of 11 sectors ended higher - Utilities up 2.3%! The other 8 industry groups fell at least 2.8% each. That's some bifurcation.
299 2018-10-24 22:08:09 Most markets are getting slammed this week, tech stocks in particular!
- DOW down 600 points
- S&P down 3%
- NASDAQ down 4.4% (Worst day since 2011)
Gains for 2018 have literally been wiped off the table. Meanwhile, crypto’s looking stable? (Unintentional rhyme, I know). #crypto
300 2018-10-24 22:07:28 Earning aren’t performing, I guess. 

“U.S. stocks plunged again on Wednesday, confirming a correction for the Nasdaq and erasing the Dow and the S&P 500's gains for the year...”
301 2018-10-24 22:06:46 One big advantage of buying stocks only when everything is in alignment   (market direction, sector strength, ST and LT stock chart etc.)  is that you are unlikely to ever by heavily invested in these type of environments.   Limiting draw downs is critical for long term success.
302 2018-10-24 22:06:15 .STOCKS...a lot of investors are worried about the stock market  risk...midterms looming and an unstable goofball in the WH...what will  the Nutcake do, when the Democrats win?  What will the world do if  republicans cheat and win?
303 2018-10-24 22:05:52 Hello Jim, is it just a short for October closing and bounce back by within few days? My stocks are under hammer, NFLX, TLRY, APPL INTC & SQ, please advise how should I play ? Start bottom buying now or should I wait for more fall in near future ?
304 2018-10-24 22:05:51 Next 12 months very interesting.  US stocks overvalued , our house market declining, a new govt middle next year.  A nervous time ahead if your overcommitted.

308 2018-10-24 22:04:58 I agree, the fact that Gold hasnt broken down is more interesting that it hasnt gone up.  $ is just now starting to flow out of stocks and as of now most likely going into bonds.  It wont take much of that flow to push Gold through the roof when it starts.

310 2018-10-24 22:04:37 investors reach for higher beta, which dampens the high beta returns relative to low beta in their model. If investors knew higher beta had lower returns than the market, they wouldn't reach for beta among stocks.

315 2018-10-24 22:03:14 @GuyAdami Guy, EVERYONE jumping on the $AMD trade after it spike over $28, ARE GETTING CRUSHED NOW.  It's NOT how you trade/invest. U NEVER chase stocks up on the hype AND WAIT for the bad news.  NOW at $18 u shud b buying tho everyone is selling! Bad advice to buy AMD at $25-30!

317 2018-10-24 22:03:03 Gold and the Dollar (which it’s priced in) are more closely tied. If stocks dump, and Dollar rallies (as safe haven), then Gold will struggle to go up, as you need less Dollars to buy the gold - as it went up in value ;)
318 2018-10-24 22:02:58 Rough day on the market for all stocks and music industry felt the pain. @livenation is down 4%, MSG is down 3.4% and @eventbrite closes the day down 7.2 percent. EB has seen most if its post IPO gains disappear — another 8% drop would push it under the $23 IPO from last month

321 2018-10-24 22:02:15 I agree with Calvin....1k in stocks won't pay you what 1k in yourself will
322 2018-10-24 22:01:10 So all the libatards response to this is, the stock market is down 600 points! I'm guessing non of you liberal losers even own stocks, because stocks are not a hand out. For all of us who do own stocks, thanks mr president, I'm still up 34% since you took office.
323 2018-10-24 22:00:52 Today I sold all of my stocks and I am shorting Donald Trump.

328 2018-10-24 21:58:53 Well myself and 95% of the population isn’t wealthy beyond imagination like those that his tax scam was meant to enrich further. Believe it or not, many folks have no 401k’s, no stocks & bonds, many are elderly on fixed incomes, all future generation, just to mention a few.......
329 2018-10-24 21:58:38 Stocks dump to recent lows, S&P down 10%, and #Gold cannot muster a new higher high. C’mon people. One has nothing to do with the other. At  least, not until stocks crash imho.
330 2018-10-24 21:58:31 my stocks been eating lately
331 2018-10-24 21:58:27 Nice , just don't buy the stocks though.
332 2018-10-24 21:58:21 Trump's volatility will cause a continuing roller coaster ride for stocks.
333 2018-10-24 21:57:55 U.S. stocks tumbled again on Wednesday, confirming a correction for the Nasdaq and erasing the Dow and S&P 500's gains for the year, as disappointing forecasts from chipmakers and weak home sales data fueled worries about economic and profit growth.

336 2018-10-24 21:57:43 They're in a really tough position now. If they continue with rate hikes stocks might continue to drop and deficits will definitely increase. If they decide to raise rates their credibility and maybe the US dollar go out the window.
337 2018-10-24 21:57:40 Stocks now at session lows. Dow -350 points.
338 2018-10-24 21:57:16 This is a Democratic plot. They are selling all their stocks to make Trump look bad?
339 2018-10-24 21:57:12 Most voters don’t own stocks and probably don’t care much about the stock market.

342 2018-10-24 21:56:20 World stocks generally lower, US crashes: Europe -.2%; US -3.1%. Fear overtook the US market as some weakness in earnings exacerbated China trade war fears. S&P 500 gave up year's gains. Buying opportunity for the brave if US markets fall tomorrow. Foreign markets likely lower.
343 2018-10-24 21:56:16 Stocks open mixed. Dow higher, S&amp;P, NASDAQ lower, for now,
344 2018-10-24 21:56:09 Stocks dropped yet again on Wednesday, as the S.&P. 500 gave up its gains for 2018.

375 2018-10-24 21:49:30 Nothing proceeds in a straight line and people who trade stocks generally think a picture of a freaked out trader in the newspaper is a sign of a short term bottom. IMO more down to come but when is less clear.
376 2018-10-24 21:48:41 Notice his choice of words when he says Trump's policies have "helped stocks", not the workers or other stakeholders. That's all the economy is to these people - a number on a ticker tape that they can gamble for cash.

383 2018-10-24 21:47:17 Should you react to market downswings? If you are a long term investor with a balance of stocks/bonds you're comfortable with, ignore short term market moves.

391 2018-10-24 21:46:15 I just can't keep track of the "reason" behind this surge in stock market volatility. 

Two weeks ago, it was high interest rate fears. 
Last week, it was China economic growth fears. 
This week, it's tariffs. 

LOL.

How about: Stocks are down because stocks are down??

393 2018-10-24 21:45:33 Dam! the Stock Market keeps falling, all stocks are down!  -600 points
394 2018-10-24 21:45:15 Crypto will probably lag behind at first. It's easy to transition out of stocks and into paper gold.  Crypto is a bit harder right now.
395 2018-10-24 21:45:06 OK, shooting is a pass time.

Bump stocks?

Military style assault rifles, manufactured to mow ppl down.

I don't see the "skill" or pass time value w/ these.
396 2018-10-24 21:44:51 Well the good thing as stocks come down they do get cheaper like $CAT now has a 3% dividend not much when competing with bonds. But still. Maybe something after this trend breaks
397 2018-10-24 21:44:40 Mi filosofía es la de los ricos 
398 2018-10-24 21:42:55 Jumped a school of sharks on these amateur FF devices, and the wealthy liberals are pulling a 2008, selling off stocks to deliberately tank the stock market, anything they can do to throw the election. The more bizarre the activity, the more obvious it gets..
399 2018-10-24 21:42:26 USING ONLY GIFS FROM AMERICAN PSYCHO, DESCRIBE HOW YOUR STOCKS PERFORMED TODAY.
400 2018-10-24 21:42:24 @Honor_FR  et @TopAchat si jamais vous avez trop de stocks hein on est la
401 2018-10-24 21:42:20 Stocks are so volatile!! People should move to crypto. Much stable
402 2018-10-24 21:42:10 The DOW should be 19k to 22k. Anything above that is gravy. Look to buy strong fundamental stocks with under 20 PE ratios. The only exception would be any electric autos that show up with 250 mile range at an under $20k price. Buy those battery & auto manufacture at 100x multiple
403 2018-10-24 21:42:05 U.S. stocks tumble again, wiping out all of 2018 gains. The market has returned to 2017 levels when the #GOPTaxScam for the rich was signed. 

@realDonaldTrump and @tedcruz economic polices DON’T work. #voteblue 

Interest rates rising, cost of goods rising.
404 2018-10-24 21:42:01 He has so much to hide that all the holes are full...
Even the only good arguments that he had are turning against him!
Stocks and Jobs.
He's a failed President.
Best thing he could do is #Resign
405 2018-10-24 21:41:44 Can you give me your list of stocks that are wiped out? Fish stocks are affected by a lot of factors like sea temp, feeding patterns, winter storms, predators, pollution, seismic surveys. As such fishermen observe cyclical booms and busts over many years.
406 2018-10-24 21:41:44 I hope you think of all the Tesla employees and their families that hold and stocks and options and are grateful for their gains.
407 2018-10-24 21:41:32 I don’t think we bottom until Warren Buffett comes on @CNBC and says stocks will be higher in 5 to 10 years.
408 2018-10-24 21:41:13 But what do I suggest?! It outperformed the Vanguard Small Cap fund but that fund is almost 10% more stocks.
409 2018-10-24 21:41:11 When interest rates collapse people flee savings/bonds to stocks in search of return.  If bitcoin is looking promising and there is a flight from stocks, there is a chance some of that finds its way to crypto
410 2018-10-24 21:41:10 Same old same old. Jim Cramer comes on again says it’s time to buy tech stocks; especially still lofty tech stocks at still ridiculous levels. Breaking news: Trump’s tax break for wealthy/corps sugar high will run out in 6 months. Just replay last week’s hour long show.
411 2018-10-24 21:40:53 Hard to believe that #crypto is the least volatile asset class I own. $BTC #stocks
412 2018-10-24 21:40:11 my account is doing fine seeing that i do not short stocks. I am more concern for longs who think Tesla stock will continue to stay high even if they continue to have profitable quarters.
413 2018-10-24 21:40:07 Baby Man,@realDonaldTrump congratulations on yet another record!!! So far, twice this year ( or should We say twice this month ) during YOUR watch stocks have DROPPED more than a thousand points!!! Didn't you say that a President should be impeached under those circumstances????
414 2018-10-24 21:40:06 lololol tell us about more stocks you aren't buying.  joke
415 2018-10-24 21:40:01 Phrase: plummeting technology stocks "infiltrating other sectors of the market"
416 2018-10-24 21:40:00 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
417 2018-10-24 21:39:51 Too late! I checked on my 401k and my other stocks too. 
418 2018-10-24 21:39:28 Working for a hedgefund doesn't mean s**t. All sorts of 'experts' were wrong 10 years ago and are going to be wrong today as well. We don't need tax cuts helping stocks, we need taxes to fund the infrastructure rebuilding we need. Taxes do that, not cuts.
419 2018-10-24 21:39:23 That's because that's not what is happening right now. We've seen a strong accumulation over a long period, people who got out of the market and whales are the one playing with small caps which are easier to move. People buying stocks would never buy small caps at this point.
420 2018-10-24 21:39:12 Wall Street isn’t the US economy. It’s bankers’ playground, and they have decided to screw the plebes this month. Never “invest” anything in stocks that you can’t afford to lose to Buffett, Steyer, Soros, Koch, Singer, etc.
421 2018-10-24 21:38:56 Hello tim was bad day for stocks I'm watching fast money hello fast money team
422 2018-10-24 21:38:48 Stocks are down af. It’s ok to invest if you think there’s going to be a bounce back but I wouldn’t bet on it.
423 2018-10-24 21:38:22 Whenever the pension adviser at work comes in to run through pension investment options, real estate, stocks, currency... I would pick crypto all day long if on the menu. No doubt this will change over time..
424 2018-10-24 21:37:39 U.S. stocks tumbled again on Wednesday afternoon,confirming a correction for the Nasdaq & erasing the Dow & S&P 500's gains for 2018.
425 2018-10-24 21:37:25 $AMRN está espectacular , aguanta todo , a la espera de la conferencia del 10 nov . Pero no la tiran ni a palos .
426 2018-10-24 21:37:23 @realDonaldTrump Stocks down again 600 points.  Will you please pull your head out and do something before you lose all my money!
427 2018-10-24 21:37:23 .@realdonaldtrump @erictrump @donaldjtrumpjr  
October 24, 2018 - Stocks fall again; Dow sheds more than 600 points
428 2018-10-24 21:37:12 do they predict stocks ??
429 2018-10-24 21:37:03 Stocks are going DOWN bro what’s going on can someone explain to me ?
430 2018-10-24 21:37:00 Guy stop defending the FED, yes you can tell FED to back off so Powell does not undermine our negotiating against China. Now we are the losers, how does that help us @jimcramer talk to Cramer he has a handle on it. I doubt you are in stocks, otherwise you would be squealing.
431 2018-10-24 21:36:34 a company thats never been profitable in 10 years? hell people were shorting Vegas stocks and betting against "billionaires" and those casinos were making bank. whats your point?
432 2018-10-24 21:36:14 To add, in the last recession, stocks peaked a year before the crash and then took about 5 months of bottom out. Stocks just peaked earlier this month. Earnings are still strong. Wait for unemployment to start spiking and then buy when the economy is improving again
433 2018-10-24 21:36:11 the big banks have all reduced their exposure to stocks, even (the market is mostly retail rn)

the big boys stay alive by playing safe

their only goal is not to win, just to not be the next lehman brothers

they won't be taking any risks with customer funds in a market crisis
434 2018-10-24 21:36:10 his sexist a*s can’t properly manage female artists, he’s doing the best he can to make blackpink flop ughhh he won’t even admit that if it wasn’t for bp yg stocks would be so much lower, they literally sold almost as much as ikon did with 4 songs (just using them as an example)
435 2018-10-24 21:35:49 why do stocks crash some Octobers?
October is the 7th month from what Gann considered the NATURAL beginning of the year March 21st.
waterfall declines can occur in Oct when the annual and natural cycles converge as i have shown on the Square of 9 Wheel...
not voodoo...cool cash
436 2018-10-24 21:35:36 Google $GOOGL now in a bear market. Closing high 26 July at $1285 to low yesterday of $1057.12 is down 21.5%. 
A number of stocks peaked around that late July date.
437 2018-10-24 21:35:30 If the stock market is making you nevrous, you should never have been in the stock market.

438 2018-10-24 21:35:28 Anyone who promises quick money off of stocks is lying btw.
439 2018-10-24 21:35:20 Wall Steet establishment types think the Dems will take the House, which is why there's a gradual sell-off. And guess what stocks are being sold off? Tech and Media. Watch the stock market boom the day after Republicans keep control.
440 2018-10-24 21:35:15 I made $4 off stocks fuck this 9-5 shit going self made billionaire
441 2018-10-24 21:34:20 Amazing how much you can lose with only 5% in stocks.
442 2018-10-24 21:34:13 Market corrections were expected. They always do. Investors are paying attention to their own stocks.
443 2018-10-24 21:33:35 Correct and this is stocks that have matured. Not infancy like crypto.
444 2018-10-24 21:33:21 What stocks did you buy or companies did you invest in?

451 2018-10-24 21:32:44 Stocks like NFLX and TSLA are benefitting from The Greater Fool theory, which is essentially the idea that something is "worth" as much as people can be fooled into thinking it's worth for as long as they can be fooled. The irrational valuation will find reality eventually.
452 2018-10-24 21:32:41 Good update ...ivy portfolio might be selling US stocks in a few days
453 2018-10-24 21:32:18 Stocks going down humm.   Well we will see.  How economy goes. I guess
454 2018-10-24 21:32:17 Guy, I lost 30% of my savings. I had margin that magnified my loss. I know only fast pros should have margins. There has been FEAR @ubs Emanuel is correct, forget about defending Powell. He has hurt markets, EMM, jobs. I doubt you have stocks? perhaps all short @jimcramer @
455 2018-10-24 21:32:08 So just bad timing of good earnings? or are you saying generally (generally) all stocks that have good earnings are not are not resulting in an increase in stock price right now?
456 2018-10-24 21:31:56 @realDonaldTrump 
"Stocks dropped for the sixth consecutive session, wiping out this year’s gains."

Is the the beginning of the 
TRUMP REVERSAL of the
OBAMA RECOVERY?

You have ridden the
success of OBAMA 
long enough...
It will ALWAYS be HIS

The REVERSAL, however,
is YOURS
457 2018-10-24 21:31:53 because stocks are safer returns
458 2018-10-24 21:30:37 if the stocks in the index aren't trading anything can happen in the futures.
459 2018-10-24 21:30:35 Stocks?
460 2018-10-24 21:30:29 The #stockmarket still has a roller coaster ahead where @DowJones @Nasdaq will rise and fall with a one step forward two to four steps back over the next months. Foresee a great deal more coming off the bubble market. -5000 I see by February #stocks #dowjones #financial #predict
461 2018-10-24 21:30:04 @adam_stocks_
462 2018-10-24 21:29:43 I’m planning on getting a vasectomy soon so if anyone wants near perfect genes for their kids hit me up while stocks last
463 2018-10-24 21:29:40 Who cares about that? We sure don't after profit is locked ever heard of daytrading?
It means you enter & exit a stock same day, minutes if needed to lock good profit then move to next one & do same. Lock +7% profit on each do that on 3 stocks it's +20% a day and +400%/month
464 2018-10-24 21:29:35 Supposedly, investors are more rational now, diligently buying the dips. Tomorrow will be a small test to see if human nature has changed. Or have the past few years of buying stocks at historically high valuations been the test?
465 2018-10-24 21:28:49 It’s 8 nov the ER . From the 3 stocks I have in portfolio I am much more confident on $AMRN $SENS . Not so sure about $FNKO .
466 2018-10-24 21:28:18 SuperUs: Loren had paid 26 M for a condo in NYC that I would get for less than 10 M. Because I am honest to what I can afford. Even at selling when it’s time. It’s time to sell. Stocks last much longer. Strange! @adamlevine @realDonaldTrump @jrridinger @BillGates @WarrenBuffett
467 2018-10-24 21:28:07 Listen to your financial adviser but also be mindful of your near term and long term goals...I saw this U.S stock dip coming all while being encouraged to invest more in US stocks...wasnt part of my short to midterm plan so I pulled out...#grateful
468 2018-10-24 21:27:59 Closed my $amd short at the close 
 Switched my short hedge to shorting canna stocks 
469 2018-10-24 21:27:53 When you learn from twitter anything you gained from stocks this year was just erased lol smfh
470 2018-10-24 21:27:32 Now you're pretending to be a detective along with a political expert, climate expert & stocks & finance expert, you must be mega rich with all that talent, if so then why are you doing a low budget low production crappy opinion based podcast ??
471 2018-10-24 21:27:29 Poor people will spend $100 a year on lotto tickets instead of investing that in some stocks or high yield savings account. We have to  spread knowledge to our fellow broke family members. Together we can all live better lives. Improve the world and regain our freedom from money.
472 2018-10-24 21:27:24 El volumen de hoy no ha sido tan alto . Y creo que la caída esa final de pánico ha sido por el tema de las bombas recibidas por los demócratas Obama , Hilary y Soros .... yo veo irracional las caídas que estamos viendo . Es verdad que tardará la normalidad .

476 2018-10-24 21:26:35 I remember when I first joined @Stash. I had a near heart attack every day watching stocks go up and down. Now I just check to see what my money is doing and know that fluctuations happen. #BabySteps #Investing
477 2018-10-24 21:26:34 Hey @realDonaldTrump my stocks are sucking ass thanks to you & your reckless economic BS, tariffs & chaos of unqualified EVERYTHING!! Please resign to save America & let's get a qualified, intelligent Sane person in Office! #RESIGN
478 2018-10-24 21:26:10 the stocks that i own have been down for over a year for over a month.
479 2018-10-24 21:25:53 Nah. Perfect time to buy more stocks. Anyone who understands the ebbs and flows of the market knows that. Any smart investor has money in other places as well.
480 2018-10-24 21:25:37 With stocks down again and erasing the gains for 2018 economy still going high could be thought sign of trouble from the recession's of 01 then propped up by the housing market then great recession of 08 if I was investing money it be in strong companies hang on  storms  coming
481 2018-10-24 21:24:57 Dow erases gains for the year, tumbles more than 600 points as stocks extend October swoon....This is the Market's way of predicting the midterm outcome.
482 2018-10-24 21:24:39 We knew a Wall Street crash was comingNow it Time for all the of Congress, the NSGOP that are home for their Break they don’t deserve,The White House Staff, Trump & His Cabinet to show the American People what Stocks they own so we can see who Cashed out before the DOW Crashed
483 2018-10-24 21:24:12 NonGAAP earnings are your problem. They are not standard and therefore not reliable and not comparable. Markets and individual stocks are much more easy to figure when you use similar units of measure. That's the whole purpose of GAAP.
484 2018-10-24 21:24:05 Multiple bomb threats
Multiple shootings in various public places
Stocks majorly down

...this is just a bad day!  Everyone go to bed, and we'll try again tomorrow!
485 2018-10-24 21:23:56 U.S. stocks plunge far lower Wednesday afternoon,10/24/18: $DJIA -2.41% (-608.0) at 24,583.42, $SPX -3.09% (-84.5) at 2,656.10, $COMPQ -4.43% (-329.1) at 7,108.40.
486 2018-10-24 21:23:05 'BREAKING: Stocks plunge again, wiping out gains for the year; technology swoon pulls Nasdaq 12 percent below August peak.'  AP

Yup, kicking some ass, you are?
487 2018-10-24 21:22:30 Will just say this- if price is truth, how can you say stocks shouldn’t have been where they were- price is where they are today- not predictive of where will be tomorrow- not looking for a debate- just kind of hate that saying
488 2018-10-24 21:22:14 Great job on those stocks, yo. Not.
@realDonaldTrump
489 2018-10-24 21:22:00 oh no the richest 10% own 85% of those stocks what ever are they going to do
490 2018-10-24 21:21:20 U.S. stocks plunge far lower Wednesday afternoon,10/24/18: $DJIA -2.41% at 24,583.42, $SPX -3.09% at 2,656.10, $COMPQ -4.43% at 7,108.40, $RUT -3.79% at $1468.70.
491 2018-10-24 21:21:19 Stocks tanking boy
492 2018-10-24 21:21:17 With the US needing to roll seven to eight trillion in next 12 mths, those lines can't stay below zero for very long - that's effectively the US govt's oxygen hose being cut off.  Feb's and Oct's action of rising ten-yr ylds on falling stocks very telling IMO
493 2018-10-24 21:21:05 People are certainly high on weed stocks.
494 2018-10-24 21:21:04 I don't know anything about purchasing/wisely investing with stocks, but I'm really tempted to buy some Nintendo.  Seriously as long as they don't drop the ball like they did with Super Mario Party's online, it's sales are gonna break records (and so many new online subs too!)
495 2018-10-24 21:20:35 you're (were) on stocks fam ?
496 2018-10-24 21:20:20 I have a big misstaken so I should be reminded to correct about my stocks price expectation.
497 2018-10-24 21:20:12 The Nasdaq Composite plunged into correction territory for the first time in more than two years, the latest sign of wavering investor confidence in the technology stocks that have powered the most recent leg of the bull market.
498 2018-10-24 21:20:11 Coincidence bomb scares on a day where stocks continued to get pounded?
499 2018-10-24 21:19:53 Hey @Poundland can you guys help me locate a store in the north east England (Middlesbrough) that stocks @Unilever Cif Stainless Steel Cleaner as I can’t find it anywhere?  Thank you. #mrshinch #cleanhome #cifclean
500 2018-10-24 21:19:29 Maybe the gold stocks can anticipate the pressure the Fed is going to be under to reverse their "Whoopee, everything is great" rate hikes. I like how gold is ignoring the dollar strength and holding its ground, waiting for it to end so it can resume its move above 1200.
501 2018-10-24 21:19:13 It’s an opinion folks, geez! Stocks are overvalued due to their guidance and not actually numbers. Many companies don’t even make a profit and have a market value in the millions. Pure manipulation by the big boys, also!
502 2018-10-24 21:19:06 How's the Stock Market doing?

505 2018-10-24 21:16:29 Dow erases gains for the year, tumbles more than 600 points as stocks extend October swoon
506 2018-10-24 21:16:28 This happens routinely and is a market correction.  The international markets do play into it, but many stocks become overvalued and then this happens.
You also have people who purposefully screw with the market so they can buy stocks at a lower price.
507 2018-10-24 21:16:26 Interests is going up. Trump is doing some crazy shit and is overheating the economy. And people are suprised stocks are falling..
508 2018-10-24 21:16:17 @petenajarian Wells Fargo advises that it will not permit trades in $CGC or other marijuana stocks??? How can that be?? Are you aware of this ?
509 2018-10-24 21:16:13 Stocks, corporate bonds, gold is where foreign official accounts seem to have been adding to ownership levels.
510 2018-10-24 21:16:09 @cnbc @CNBCFastMoney Let me point out something being missed.  I am seeing that MANY stocks had lower intraday lows YESTERDAY than today.  Like: HD MRO ATVI AVAV VMC MLM ROKU TSLA USO CGC CRON TLRY APHQF..  Now consider today's big drop mixed with this info..
511 2018-10-24 21:15:57 FAAG stocks also under pressure. 
Facebook corrected about 32% from the peak.
512 2018-10-24 21:15:49 Why is it when y’all are losing an argument you change the argument? We can start another one if you want but I don’t see the point. The Dow ranked today. Good news for investors, stocks are cheep right now. These are the times that make millionaires. Invest!
513 2018-10-24 21:15:33 @realDonaldTrump “Breaking News: U.S. stocks tumbled again, with the S&P 500 down more than 3% amid a run of selling that has wiped out all market gains for the year.” MAGA????
514 2018-10-24 21:15:23 Not in it :) Premiums too high - It will be interesting to see if it holds and helps other tech stocks.. Many at support levels and end of day flush was good..
515 2018-10-24 21:15:18 “Stocks falling due to realization Trump administration more full of shit than a cattle feed lot”
Fixed.
516 2018-10-24 21:15:15 if you use that logic....... why have stocks been rising so far this year and bitcoin has retraced 80-90% ....... its such a small asset class that the two have very little correlation
517 2018-10-24 21:15:02 And that’s true for a lot other stocks out there. Everyone is buying the dip
518 2018-10-24 21:14:55 Load up stocks bro! You got account ready ?
519 2018-10-24 21:14:38 i think gold will continue to breakout, and stocks will continue to break down.

i was early, and this is what i've been both calling for, and positioned in, since late 2015 to early 2016.
520 2018-10-24 21:14:35 Don’t shoot til u see the white of their eyes. Or in the case of stocks, don’t buy til @CNBC has an after hours “Market Report” special show. Oh hey.. guess what is on CNBC tonight @ 7p Eastern 
521 2018-10-24 21:14:25 @jimcramer I'm looking into the pot stocks. Wanting to know what happened to them.
522 2018-10-24 21:14:02 David Weild IV from @weildco does not believe that investors will do research on Tokens on STO exchanges. He believes there will need to be people calling investors on phones to explain the companies or STO exchanges will be just like penny stocks #CryptoInvestSummit
523 2018-10-24 21:13:53 Everything is so fucked up I just wanna enjoy music my favs make, I really don't need to know if their company stocks are dropping or any of that shit
I really miss that time when I started liking kpop and did join FB groups that vote for who looks better in red shirts...
524 2018-10-24 21:13:42 Haha... Idk. Asking the wrong gal. I never watch the TV for bus or stocks. I watch my apps, the AP and Reuters, and talk frequently to other friends who are investing...
525 2018-10-24 21:13:21 Investors flee stocks on global worries, Fabinho rise
526 2018-10-24 21:12:47 Stocks taking a beating overnight in the US
527 2018-10-24 21:12:44 same, they be attacking wildly then when one man left they be like woah why do you have two stocks. dumbasses smh
528 2018-10-24 21:12:40 Wow $NVDA at $40!! Might have to get back into stocks later next year 
529 2018-10-24 21:12:04 Three big uncertainties dragging down stocks right now: midterm election, tariffs, interest rates.  The first two will diminish in 3 weeks.  The third is going to hang around through next year.
530 2018-10-24 21:11:52 It’s not good news for midterms. Most people aren’t dumb enough to overreact to a three week stretch of stocks being down. Also, it amazes me how little the people who comment here know about how the stock market works. This just turns into a trump bash for no reason
531 2018-10-24 21:11:22 Im led to believe it's an estate that stocks old tups etc so they can extract $$$$$$$ from silly yanks.
532 2018-10-24 21:11:18 lol it's like people are just realizing stocks can go down too!
533 2018-10-24 21:10:54 How much did the stocks go up after Pres. Trump winning in 2016?
Let’s hear something. Like 
534 2018-10-24 21:10:48 The gun issue is similar to immagration or anything else. If we as a whole would just follow the laws that are in place already, there would be way less issues. Having said that, bump stocks are unnecessary and there are people that shouldn’t be allowed to have guns but you can’t
535 2018-10-24 21:10:40 $AGX FTW!!!  My stock portfolio’s sole green line.  Seeing where we are today I think next week is gonna be interesting with hundreds of companies reporting earnings all at once. Buckle up! #stocks #investing
536 2018-10-24 21:10:33 Stocks fell sharply into the closing bell Wednesday as concerns over  earnings and geopolitical tensions continued to rattle Wall Street.
537 2018-10-24 21:10:33 In the meantime in the real world. Stocks drop another 600 points today. Wake up America your future finances are in the hands of Donald J Trump AKA The Bankruptcy king . Filed bankruptcy 11 times. #ImpeachTrump. #25/45.
538 2018-10-24 21:10:27 I’m guessing you’re not a minority, don’t own stocks, and have good health care.
539 2018-10-24 21:09:56 For those who thought tRUMP was a businessman, have you looked at your 401K or stocks lately? The Dow plummeted again today. Growth was much higher with Obama. #DonTheCon #VoteBlue
540 2018-10-24 21:09:41 The only surprise about this nine-year bull mkt has been how long it took for the inevitable breadth divergence to show up. Otherwise, the pattern setups have been the same b/c human nature -- fear and greed -- never changes #stocks
541 2018-10-24 21:09:27 Well if you think today was nuts, wait until Mueller lays out  undisputable evidence of how corrupt Trump is and they start impeachment hearings. Good luck with all the AR15’s and bump stocks. I sure hope I’m wrong, but this is what Trump is creating.
542 2018-10-24 21:09:26 How are Aussie stocks faring?
543 2018-10-24 21:09:09 Every show every day every hour is a mirror of this. Go buy stocks it's Tuesday. Elon Musk farted buy stocks. EM sold off 10% look cheap buy some, EM sold off 20% pfft don't miss this last chance to buy cheap.
544 2018-10-24 21:08:43 Thanks to the ill-fated Trade War-tax cuts which will lead huge deficits and then to a Economic collapse. "But I'm just a poor dummies, what do I know!" Not to mention unstable leadership. Abandonment of Nuclear treaty & arms race-bad move. I read charts. #Commodities #Stocks
545 2018-10-24 21:08:36 Earnings don't matter - price is truth. Some of these tech stocks shouldn't be this high in the first place so 20-40% pullbacks are kinda normal
546 2018-10-24 21:08:24 Stocks are down for the year. 600 points today as a matter of fact.  Deficits are forecast to reach $1 trillion this fiscal year. So much winning I can't stand it. #magabomber
547 2018-10-24 21:08:04 
548 2018-10-24 21:07:45 @realDonaldTrump Stocks plunge AGAIN. Thanks alot, you jackass.
#VoteBlue
549 2018-10-24 21:07:38 @jimcramer Wells Fargo advises that it will not permit trades in $CGC or other marijuana stocks??? How can that be?? Are you aware of this ?
550 2018-10-24 21:07:32 Just spoke to a millionaire who told me there's 3 keys to prosperity:
1) Buy stocks.
2) Have a vision.
3) Always Tithe.
551 2018-10-24 21:07:28 Stocks were very low Toddy but I’ve baked a large selection of pies, pasties etc for tomorrow #furrytails
552 2018-10-24 21:07:27 All one had to do was buy tobacco stocks a couple of weeks ago.  Smooth sailing.
553 2018-10-24 21:07:18 Like a wise man said, no 'investor' has made money on airline stocks globally
554 2018-10-24 21:06:57 US Stocks crash to levels not seen since May
555 2018-10-24 21:06:38 U.S. #stocks lower at close of trade; Dow Jones Industrial Average down 2.41%.  Canada stocks lower at close of trade; S&P/TSX Composite down 2.56%
556 2018-10-24 21:06:31 The Richest 10% of Americans Now Own 84% of All Stocks ... they control when market goes up and they control when market goes down.  Understand.  Whether Casino or Stock market, you are playing in their house.  It is okay to play, but always understand that.
557 2018-10-24 21:06:15 Junior already spun it yesterday, when he claimed that stocks were falling because of fear that Democrats would win the House.
558 2018-10-24 21:06:15 Trump sure is keeping his mouth tight as you know what as stocks swoon. $SPX
559 2018-10-24 21:06:13 Left out disappointing earnings reports, overvalued stocks and long overdue correction. We'll know more this time next month.
560 2018-10-24 21:06:10 Russian? I got pictures of Schumer and Putin having donuts & coffee, Maxine Waters retirement investment is with a Russian company and the yelliwcake uranium sold to Russia and Podesta helped arrange that and got big money in stocks he put in his daughters account, i can go on
561 2018-10-24 21:05:48 There were large moves in the US market overnight on the back of little to no news. The US market fell 3.1% led by semiconductor chip makers and other tech stocks. Although Australia has no semiconductor makers listed on the ASX we expect that the ... 1/2 $RZI #ASX #Nasdaq
562 2018-10-24 21:05:45 Oh goody a market in turmoil show is the bottom signal. BTW we plunged to lower lows and again the #stocks <20DMA couldn’t go lower. 16% of stocks in $SPY closed over 20DMA vs 5% over on oct 11. If ppl read that bearish I got nothing for them!
563 2018-10-24 21:05:44 weed and chips. getting hammered.  #stocks #seewhatididthere
564 2018-10-24 21:05:42 Maybe 11 year run then the trade war implications, growth stocks outstripping value stocks and correction thereof, record high debt levels, and the fact that this bull run is longest in history thus at some point it should end will end the bull run.
565 2018-10-24 21:05:22 The liberals' fault? Tax breaks for biz allowed rich CEOs 2 buy back $436.6B worth of stocks in last 1/4. Not 2 hand out bonuses or improve biz machinery et al. That could've paid 1.6M workers $1000 bonuses every single trading day of that 1/4. The money's not going 2 immigrants.
566 2018-10-24 21:05:03 Trump sure is keeping his mouth shut as tight as you know what as stocks swoon.
567 2018-10-24 21:04:59 The 100 stocks that reported earnings since yesterday's close fell an average of 3.54% today.  The average EPS beat fell 1.57%...the average EPS miss fell 8.17%.  Ouch.

569 2018-10-24 21:04:39 @POTUS @WhiteHouse @Senate @Congress @RealDonaldTrump Tech Stocks Helped The Dow Today After Crashing Twice In One Week! Tesla & Microsoft Saved The Day!
570 2018-10-24 21:04:28 on which exchange/platform do you short stocks?
571 2018-10-24 21:04:25 The Boeing Company (BA) price at close, 2018-10-24, is 360.71. #boeing #stocks #NYSE #space
572 2018-10-24 21:04:22 So you have absolved yourselves of killing democracy by banning third place YYZ candidate instead of allowing ourselves to decide for ourselves? Was this a dry run to end conservative voices in federal 2019 election? May your stock prices fall through the floor of penny stocks.
573 2018-10-24 21:04:17 INFO for those with 401K  and IRA accounts.   Most accounts allow you to  move your investments WITHIN the fund from stocks to money markets  without penalty.  Talk to your fund manager to verify if you are worried  about stocks.
574 2018-10-24 21:03:50 Good thing my plug told my to take me stocks out last month
575 2018-10-24 21:03:40 If you are in #PotStocks and have been shitting your pants the last couple weeks, you probably shouldn't be in pot stocks. You weren't a genius when they spiked and aren't a loser now that they plummeted. Volatile, yes. Long term potential, still very bullish.
576 2018-10-24 21:03:33 STOCKS:  Wall Street's push help out republicans by getting  "long-term investors" to buy stocks hasn't been working.  "Long-term  investors" are asking why they should buy when professional investors  & corporate insiders are dumping their stocks at a record pace. trump's sad.
577 2018-10-24 21:03:32 The Stocks are tired of winning #MagaBomber
578 2018-10-24 21:03:29 I was mulling #BILB a couple of days ago but didnt wanna sell any other of my stocks, which have all dived recently. 130p is the sell point imho. I sold then last time. :)
579 2018-10-24 21:03:24 Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) price at close, 2018-10-24, is 288.5. #teslamotors #tesla #stocks #NASDAQ #elonmusk
580 2018-10-24 21:03:20 #WednesdayWisdom: The STOCKS (DOW) dropped 608 pts today. So that must be Obama's share, right?
581 2018-10-24 21:02:59 STOCKS:  Even though Boeing and other corporation reported awesome  earning today, the DOW dropped 600 points.  This is especially upsetting  to trump and republicans who were counting on a booming stock market so  "trumpee dumpee" could brag.
582 2018-10-24 21:02:52 #WHATaWORLD as $TSLA beats #Earnings.  The Annual Company Yaard Sale seems to have helped them swing to a 3rd QTR #Profit.  #Tesla is up 40 points plus after hours and #Elon you have my respect sir.  #Stocks #BeatTheStreet
583 2018-10-24 21:02:51 Under our approach, we want to be able to handle both ends of the spectrum:

(1)  This is the early stages of a 20% to 50% drop.
(2)  Stocks make a low and rally into year end.

If we can handle extremes, real life tends to fall somewhere in between.
584 2018-10-24 21:02:46 *gone shopping...for stocks*
585 2018-10-24 21:02:35 Wouldn’t touch stocks til after the midterms. Reps hold the house, the Nasdaq will go on a HUGE run for rest of year. If they lose ........
586 2018-10-24 21:02:23 Hasn’t been a good week for tech stocks or energy.. Guess im gonna be long in these positions after all.
587 2018-10-24 21:02:18 Stocks dont trend negative for the year...wake up.
588 2018-10-24 21:02:15 its not inherently bad, but it's why bonds and stocks have been in a bull market since march 2009.
589 2018-10-24 21:02:11 If you thought we had very active markets today, wait for tomorrow. We will have reporting AMZN, GOOGL, INTC, COP, CMCSA, AAL, BMY, MRK, KKR, MO, UNP and other key players. Mellig Group.

593 2018-10-24 21:01:24 The great negotiating skills of  Donald J Trump. AKA the king of bankruptcy continues . Stocks drop another 600 points today. Good work King Donald. #ImpeachTrump. #25/45

What a world we live in
597 2018-10-24 21:01:11 A by-product of the #IEDs in the news today - stocks and the dow took a dive. Relentless reporting caused discouragement on #WallStreet. That's a discouraging sign regardless of politics involved in the situation.

601 2018-10-24 21:00:42 Stocks are crumbling thanks to Trump's ridiculous tariffs and threats that result in a volatile market. Keep it up, Donald!
602 2018-10-24 21:00:42 weird how the creeping realization that America's norms and institutions may never recover from GOP rule hasn't been good for stocks

615 2018-10-24 20:57:52 I would never apologize to short sellers for anything. Why should a financial asset be treated any differently than a physical one? You can’t short sell bottled water to try to put Fiji out of business. That would be fraud. Shorting stocks IS FRAUD.

US stocks continue to get pummeled ! How long will BTC hold flat ? In my opinion, not too much longer. Expecting a dump soon...
619 2018-10-24 20:57:19 Some tech-heavy U.S. fund managers have turned to the once-stodgy payments sector as an alternative to so-called FANG stocks as high-flyers like Facebook Inc and Google parent Alphabet Inc falter.

624 2018-10-24 20:56:33 I have been following the Canadian junior sector for 30 years, with a few exceptions, if you bough a basket of stocks every year in last half of Oct, and sold them every early March, you would be a rich man. Also, tax loss selling is a factor this time of year.
625 2018-10-24 20:56:19 It’s good that it pays a dividend, even though dividends can get cut during bad recessions.
When the Fed is raising rates, stocks start running into trouble. In a few months, it might be possible to get 3-4% per year in a long-term bank CD, fully insured.
Let’s see what happens
626 2018-10-24 20:56:15 #Crypto stocks are@started to get some attention @jimcramer When will you showcase one on your show. Beaten up at their lows, and major news on the horizon.  #blockchaintechnology

629 2018-10-24 20:56:02 The room was divided into sections of ever increasing persuasiveness. There was a modest set of stocks for those at the start of their tortuous journey. At the far end was the dreadful rack, a device whose notable absence of spikes & blades belied its effectiveness.

632 2018-10-24 20:55:52 I really have no beef with traders making a call, unless of course they are colluding, or acting on inside info, or selling as they are calling a buy.
My main beef is with charlatans who praise a stocks Fundamentals when it has none.
Which is most of the broker stocks 
633 2018-10-24 20:55:52 *face palm* 

Anyone that buys stocks knows that it's the perfect time to buy in. However, most that do are usually wealthy by proxy because they follow this rule...so I'm just gonna leave that there.

643 2018-10-24 20:53:49 Should have been more active and buy more $TSLA stocks. Good job TESLA !
644 2018-10-24 20:53:46 The market has returned to 2017 levels. Corporate America shows its true colors. Petulance's #TaxScam gives them liquidity to pump up their stocks only to watch the rug pulled out from under him. This is what unbridled capitalism looks like. #opNWO
645 2018-10-24 20:53:40 STOCKS:  The Dow's declined over 2,000 points in last two weeks...some analysis are predicting another 2,000 to 5,000 point drop.  This would be similar to the 10% to 20% stock market decline of China and Europe.  Investors are realizing trump's economic policies suck.   @DNC
646 2018-10-24 20:53:39 Stocks, bonds, caravan. What a mess
647 2018-10-24 20:53:37 I agree. Base on foreign markets too it seems we are heading away from this 11 year bull run. Do you expect stocks yo carry us through Nov and Dec to an ATH retest, fail, then dump in Feb? Or before that?
648 2018-10-24 20:53:23 Some tech-heavy U.S. fund managers have turned to the once-stodgy payments sector as an alternative to so-called FANG stocks as high-flyers like Facebook Inc and Google parent Alphabet Inc falter.

650 2018-10-24 20:52:56 Stocks plunge again, wiping out gains for the year   4:13 PM EDT Oct 24, 2018
651 2018-10-24 20:52:48 Investors flee stocks on global worries, Treasuries rise
652 2018-10-24 20:52:39 With 401k $$$, it is best not to watch the day to day gyrations of the market.  Regardless of various temp help hanging out in WH stock based mutuals will be higher when you retire decades from now. If you're retiring sooner, start getting out of stocks.
653 2018-10-24 20:52:34 Another huge day today....I hope I helped you make money....Just want to let you know....If you want to continue to trade alerts....Please like and retweet this tweet!!! #options #stocks #makemoney
654 2018-10-24 20:52:30 It depends on your time horizon and confidence in the Fed. As a LT investor, I think stocks are beginning to go on sale.
655 2018-10-24 20:52:28 Hondurans, Haitians and unidentified Middle Easterners sold the shit out of their FANG stocks.
656 2018-10-24 20:52:18 Axios PM: Political terrorism in America — Stocks plummet — 1  thing
657 2018-10-24 20:52:17 Yes, we had the good times for a long time. Remember 2017 was the least volatile market in history and stocks mostly went straight up. My technique is not to look at my long term holdings. I just buy more.
658 2018-10-24 20:51:53 Stocks crashing, new bizarre world events by the day. They are trying to engineer the public’s decision  in this election. I pray the public has wisened up. If the current “establishment” loses this one they are done. No Russia hysteria will blunt the blow #Populismrising
659 2018-10-24 20:51:49 Stocks tanked again today, are you going to take credit or blame? You normally are screaming loudly about modest gains so it seems you should say something. @realDonaldTrump
660 2018-10-24 20:51:47 These Fake Bomb reports have affected Wall Street this week, all stocks are down maybe for the rest of the week!
661 2018-10-24 20:51:42 @GotagaTV Bonsoir, sais-tu quand est-ce que les t-shirts ne seront plus en rupture de stocks ?  J'ai pas eu le temps d'en acheter un je suis tristesse.

665 2018-10-24 20:51:12 It’s not just the U.S. whose stocks ended lower today...literally stock markets all around the world ended lower today. Can’t wait to see what Q4 has in store.
666 2018-10-24 20:50:58 Traditional markets looking kind of disturbing today. Join $crypto and let's have some fun. #trading #investing #cash #money #stocks #markets
667 2018-10-24 20:50:58 We're in, "I'm gonna buy some stocks soon because Repubs will keep House season".
668 2018-10-24 20:50:49 PM Mkt: #Corn -2; #Soybeans -7; Winter #Wheat -10. Grains drift lower on lack of news, bearish technical signals. Ethanol production up slightly, stocks lower. Export sales out tomorrow morning. Nov Option expiration on Friday.
669 2018-10-24 20:50:48 It helps to buyback your own stocks and avoid paying taxes as far as you are concerned  As far as privacy I think you could care less Tim!
670 2018-10-24 20:50:47 Ok, my stocks rekt badly, no salvation. Very likely it's bear market (finally) & it will be savage.

I miscalculated badly. Though they'll hold on until December. 

But there good news for me. I'm still 90+% in crypto & <1% in stocks 

Crazy risk management ftw. 
671 2018-10-24 20:50:06 It is time to sell all regular #stocks amd buy #gold stocks (low valuation ever)
672 2018-10-24 20:50:03 I'm looking at stocks right now first.
673 2018-10-24 20:49:56 Stocks on sale!  I'm buying!
674 2018-10-24 20:49:54 it’s such a rollercoaster. i’ve stayed away. i mostly avoid single stocks.
675 2018-10-24 20:49:46 Trumps trade wars are now taking a toll on the economy. Stocks plummet. Profits decline. Inflation goes up.

Trump fucks America. But don't worry Trump and all his rich buddies got a massive tax savings. Now he will take away health care and social security to pay for it.
676 2018-10-24 20:49:39 Stocks plummeting so close to the Midterms? @BauerleBellavia @newsradio930 smells a rat. LOL @buffalopundit
677 2018-10-24 20:49:31 Trump urges investors to move all money to pink sheet stocks. Specifically, pmurt gro. Shhh.
678 2018-10-24 20:49:24 The only realistic thing in this video is at 1:30 where the Marth is up 4 stocks to 1 against the Fox while wearing a 60-40 tag and the Fox is still going for some sick shit

Seriously good work @Ambisinister_ I rewatched every clip like 5 times lmao, incredible vid
679 2018-10-24 20:49:12 Do not despair. Longview Economics' tech view is that a relief rally of (potentially) several weeks is overdue, to be followed by yet another leg down, however #ausbiz #XJO #equities #investing #stocks
680 2018-10-24 20:49:00 If you look back, stock always take  hit in election season. its just the uncertainty of future governance. Stocks will be back up by late November
681 2018-10-24 20:48:53 i wish i could go back in time and bought some google stocks
682 2018-10-24 20:48:32 Stocks closing sharply lower on Wall Street, led by a swoon in technology companies. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 608 points, erasing gains for the year. The S&P 500 dropped 3% in its worst day since August 2011. NASDEQ fell 4%.
683 2018-10-24 20:48:31 Stock bubble bursting. Tech getting smashed. #SPX down 3% overnight Nasdaq down 4.4% and $Gold chilling. Multiples on US tech stocks still 
684 2018-10-24 20:47:56 No way to know that for sure but it there's a standing order by enough corporations to buy their stocks that go up for sale then it's not a reach to assume that's going to slow a drop in the average.
685 2018-10-24 20:47:30 Stocks continued their “Trump Dump” today. He will find a way to blame Obama. . .or immigrants. . . Anything but himself
686 2018-10-24 20:47:28 Except under Obama, stocks rose from 7k to over 19k. Facts matter
687 2018-10-24 20:47:26 Yes that can happen. I am shorting stocks which can RUN big so the best way i seem to trade them is by taking profits along the way. Locking in green and letting the rest run with a B/E stop.
688 2018-10-24 20:46:51 Recently I've been terrible with my money smh...have to go back to my money management skills and get back into stocks no more mickey mouse...

Security, petro-chem engineering, trade and transport, stocks and forex, law,  aerospace engineering, medical science, poltical science, Web programming, data structure and algorithms?
694 2018-10-24 20:46:21 Had been very confused by your bullishness re stocks with massive weekly bear divs in rsi.  Recently even on the monthly
695 2018-10-24 20:46:19 Stocks I have an eye on but are too expensive atm include: 

London Stock Exchange Group
Hargreaves Lansdown
Reckitt Benckiser
There are more but they're the ones that come to mind.
696 2018-10-24 20:46:11 The most bullish piece of news that could come out of the #Bitcoin world right now is if price breaks up while stocks continue to get pummeled.
697 2018-10-24 20:46:08 #StockMarket stumbled yet again on Wednesday, closing in negative territory for the year. DOW dropped 606 points (2.4%) to 24,584. S&P slid 84 (3.1%) to 2,656 amid a run of selling that has wiped out all market gains for the year. #stocks #investments #DowJones
698 2018-10-24 20:46:07 BREAKING: Stocks plunge again, wiping out gains for the year; technology swoon pulls Nasdaq 12 percent below August peak.
699 2018-10-24 20:45:30 Thank you TRUMP and @GOP for bringing us back to the great depression. For all of you that "don't care about stocks"; Your lack of multivalent views will leave you blindsided to the unemployment that resonates when those 1% further hoard their money.
700 2018-10-24 20:45:28 C'est LA question pour les cryptos. #Hopium : vu qu'il est certain que l'on soit voué à un krach sur les stocks US, le BTC devrait déjà refléter cet état d'esprit et les whales devraient préparer leur sortie vers une valeur refuge, SI le BTC n'en était pas une.. qu'en penses-tu ?
701 2018-10-24 20:45:26 @jimcramer $MSFT $V $XLNX taking up stocks after hours.  You realize if we gap up over 20 handles tomorrow and break 6 handles below today's close.. . The selling will be horrific again all the way down to 2600/2620 area.  This is a bad scenario.
702 2018-10-24 20:45:13 Nasdaq down more than 4% after an ugly week for stocks markets, while gold & bitcoin showing strong resistance. Is the next financials crisis already running ? #Nasdaq #cac40
703 2018-10-24 20:45:09 If guitar prices also went down with stock market drops, that would make things a bit more palatable.

708 2018-10-24 20:44:46 @CNBCFastMoney @HalftimeReport @petenajarian man, EVERYONE jumping on the $AMD trade after it spike over $28, ARE GETTING CRUSHED NOW.  It's NOT how you trade/invest. U never chase stocks up on the hype and wait for the bad news.  NOW at $18 you should be tho everyone is selling!
709 2018-10-24 20:43:58 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
710 2018-10-24 20:43:52 No one wants to hear the leader of any democracy is a white nationalist. Stocks tumble for second consecutive day after the #PresidentOfTheUnitedStates declares he is a racist to the entire world.
711 2018-10-24 20:43:50 Even gold stocks are down.
712 2018-10-24 20:43:47 You have some tips of good stocks in this area? Laramide i got already.
713 2018-10-24 20:43:42 Come on now.   All you dems posting stuff.   We all know you dont have 401k's.   Your job title is welfare.   Hows that for painting a blank canvas. Idiots.   Anyone that can't admit that stocks are up, are just sticking fingers in ears and shouting la la la like little children
714 2018-10-24 20:43:38 My stocks are up bro
715 2018-10-24 20:43:37 Stock market plunges @Nasdaq takes worst hit since 2011! Stocks are down this year across the board. Who is responsible?

718 2018-10-24 20:43:37 I wonder how many people sold Tesla stocks while the DOW 550 Down Slide
719 2018-10-24 20:43:36 Yep and I hate gambling. 

Banks stocks in 09, I didn't look at as gambling, you knew they couldn't let them collapse. 

It was thoughtless and easy money.  

A $5 pickup per share a day wasn't hard to do.
720 2018-10-24 20:43:08 As the sugar-high of Trump's reckless tax cuts fades, so goes stocks. Not only that, but Trump has trashed the US budget which will be very difficult to repair. 
US budget deficits around 5-7% of GDP would made the Italians blush
721 2018-10-24 20:43:03 Still long , need to see next days because its pure panic in all stocks now.
722 2018-10-24 20:42:46 BREAKING: Stocks plunge again, wiping out gains for the year; technology swoon pulls Nasdaq 12 percent below August peak.
723 2018-10-24 20:42:34 @realDonaldTrump stocks erased ALL gains for 2018. Not your fault when it's down right? Only when it's up. What r u going 2 say at this rally tonight? Are u going 2be a leader, a President? Will u denounce violence &stop mocking politicians? This is YOUR crowd. This is YOUR JOB.
724 2018-10-24 20:42:15 Anyone worried yet about all the hedge fund winnings by shorting US stocks? Trade war rocks for some. What about rest of us?
725 2018-10-24 20:42:12 Ok, enough bad news for the day! 

Shooting

Bombings

Any good news?

727 2018-10-24 20:41:58 "Stocks always go down faster than they go up, but they always go up more than they go down." 

Truly abysmal day for my portfolio; dunno about yours. 

But #thisishowwedoit, right?! Chin up, Fools. 
728 2018-10-24 20:41:44 Someone clearly hasn't checked the stocks today...
729 2018-10-24 20:41:40 @EcoChefBryanAu what happened to your stocks ?
730 2018-10-24 20:41:31 INFO for those with 401K  and IRA accounts.   Most accounts allow you to move your investments WITHIN the fund from stocks to money markets without penalty.  Talk to your fund manager to verify if you are worried about stocks.
731 2018-10-24 20:41:30 People resented my pension so it got slashed. So I started a retirement account late in life, so in stocks. Now I’m getting hosed again.
732 2018-10-24 20:41:28 ur net worth is likely too if u think thats the case and u actively invest in stocks. GRAT is going to be a winner. Bigtime and no im not withdrawing that statement.
733 2018-10-24 20:41:17 Just welcomed a group of children to the reference room! "Think of the adults in your life. If we have books on EVERYTHING, what books do you think they ask us for most?" Kids, immediately: "Politics! Cooking! Stocks!"
They are so paying attention to their adults.
734 2018-10-24 20:41:09 show what they look like bc i need new stocks i cba to make myself
735 2018-10-24 20:41:02 Yep your right. People are aware we do have a strong consumer right now. Don’t see it changing without something drastic happening. But stocks are at the mercy for now. Was just looking at SIX numbers. For the year are good. But got pummeled
736 2018-10-24 20:40:10 I agree but here is the thing:

Trump is promising instant and dramatic economic benefits for everyone based solely on his being in the White House. 

He should be judged by his own metrics. If a downturn in stocks was bad under Obama then it's bad under Trump.
737 2018-10-24 20:40:00 Look at stocks today. Boom! Just the beginning. Lets see if there’s a rally tomorrow or Fri. Maybe just midterms jitters. I think it’s more than that. We shall see.
738 2018-10-24 20:39:50 WOW the $NASDAQ dropped 4.5% overnight. Tech stocks will be in for a bumpy ride today.
739 2018-10-24 20:39:46 History on markets. A quick look at historical performance shows that stocks often see rough sledding in the September of years that feature midterm elections —and other years as well. For midterm years, analysts often chalk it up to uncertainty, basically fear party change.
740 2018-10-24 20:39:26 @Whiteboy7thst thoughts on the market losses today? Lots of stocks negative on the year. Could this be the floor?
741 2018-10-24 20:39:18 The fact that trump is STILL holding a rally tonight is pretty gross. ETF is he gonna talk about? Stocks are crashing and Dems are being terrorized.
742 2018-10-24 20:39:13 Yea not looking good. Happy I was forced to sell almost all my stocks to buy an apartment a little while back :)
743 2018-10-24 20:39:01 Changed my paltry funds at the end of last year, took 75% out of stocks and bought Gov bonds...figured at least I won't lose my base
744 2018-10-24 20:38:59 Buy Tech Stocks after hours today.
745 2018-10-24 20:38:48 Stocks fall sharply as tech leads sell-off
746 2018-10-24 20:38:48 Goodness, stocks are free falling 

My Roth IRA is looking painful this week. Loss after loss...

I’m at a loss.
747 2018-10-24 20:38:46 Stocks went on sale today. BUY BUY BUY!
748 2018-10-24 20:38:43 No I’m sure she knows the stocks are proactive and that claims of democrat takeover in the house and senate decrease projected prosperity thus resulting in a sell off. That’s why when the rebound to record highs in two weeks she will then also give credit to trump.
749 2018-10-24 20:38:40 trump's sad...stocks are dropping and he can't brag.
750 2018-10-24 20:38:39 Dow erases gains for the year, tumbles more than 600 points as stocks extend October swoon - CNBC
751 2018-10-24 20:38:18 fyi The stocks dropped 600 points again today alone. This isnt correction as Trump keeps saying
752 2018-10-24 20:38:06 Uncertainty is bad for stocks and our political climate has never been worse. Time to buy in if you still can.
753 2018-10-24 20:38:03 STOCKS:  Wall Street's push help out the republicans by getting "long-term investors" to buy stocks hasn't been working.  "Long-term investors" are asking why they should buy when professional investors & corporate insiders are dumping their stocks at a record pace.  trump's sad.
754 2018-10-24 20:37:57 Don't check your #stocks today
755 2018-10-24 20:37:51 You have to tell people that all stocks are at risk now. This is reaction of debt at the junk level. The rollover is not going to save these companies at new rates . New Sub Prime. Sound off at FED.
756 2018-10-24 20:37:33 Always make sure you have a diversified portfolio; when stocks fall, bonds rise.
757 2018-10-24 20:37:31 People adding cash to the sidelines, getting ready to buy stocks. 

Apropos of nothing, how’s mom?
758 2018-10-24 20:37:28 help my stocks
759 2018-10-24 20:36:55 any of yall want a pack of stocks i made myself?
760 2018-10-24 20:36:46 Means nothing to me. I hold no stocks. As far as from my own perspective, the economy sucks big donkey pudenda right now. I am part of the 99%.
761 2018-10-24 20:36:45 I did well in 2009 playing bank stocks, bought in the morning, sold in the early afternoon. 

Was averaging a couple thousand dollars a day profits. 

Kept principal the same and banked daily profits.
762 2018-10-24 20:36:37 I did in 2008 and it took all but 2000 of my savings of 20 years....I will never invest in 401k again or stocks, or bonds....I'm using my mattress.
763 2018-10-24 20:36:29 You gutted I made 500% gains of crypto this week while your stocks and gold lost you money?
764 2018-10-24 20:36:03 S&P death spiral goes like this: world is long equites in size.  Stocks go down, then global growth goes down, then equity analyst need to lower growth assumptions, then equities go down again, growth goes down again, rinse and repeat. #macro @LukeGromen @ErikSTownsend

766 2018-10-24 20:35:37 •The run-up in “growth” stocks is not the long-term trend of the markets
•Earnings growth estimates for growth stocks are quite high
•The P/E in growth stocks is near a decade high
•BIP Wealth is underweighting growth stocks, which may be “priced for perfection”
767 2018-10-24 20:35:32 nooooooo - ben! momentum stocks are risky!
768 2018-10-24 20:35:30 Is it not best time to buy stocks since S&P is dropping ?
769 2018-10-24 20:35:21 Hey @realDonaldTrump STOP SAYING THE MARKET IS THE BEST EVER! SINCE YOUVE BEEN IN OFFICE, IVE LOST MONEY ON ALL MY STOCKS. FUCK YOU.
770 2018-10-24 20:35:15 There was some real selling in individual stocks today. If you looked over my shoulder while I post the charts you'd see it.

777 2018-10-24 20:34:39 Waiting on my free stock now! Thanks Dee, I’ve always been intimidated by stocks-n-stuff and this might be fun and profitable. Instead of #onlineshopping
778 2018-10-24 20:34:03 Netflix has over $8.3B in long-term debt. Comparing your picks to terribly over-valued stocks seems rather foolish indeed.
779 2018-10-24 20:33:56 Back to 2017 eh?
GLAD I moved my volatile stocks into Money Markets back in July.
Glad you already moved yours too?
The TRump economic policy idiocy correction BEGINS in earnest
780 2018-10-24 20:33:43 I read an article about this guy in the past year. Yes, he's a long-time NYSE floor trader, but he has never owned ANY stocks in his entire life.

No doubt he sleeps well at night ...
781 2018-10-24 20:33:37 Did he say what the cows were eating in 1950? Probably all grass and no GM soya or corn, so the milk much healthier (full of omega 3 and vit K2) and the soil carbon stocks then were probably much better than now. It's not the cow its the how. #climatechange
782 2018-10-24 20:33:34 What if they want to buy stocks?
783 2018-10-24 20:33:11 "I'm sorry, did you say: sell naked calls on pot stocks?"
784 2018-10-24 20:33:09 I like watching them freak out. I find it a bit entertaining. Meanwhile things will proceed as they always have. 
Stocks will go up, I will then sell.  
Stocks will go down, I will then buy.

785 2018-10-24 20:33:03 Stocks dumping is very good for crypto and BTC in particular 

Many of you think traditional investors are still unsure of crypto but the smart money knows what’s coming and getting richer is always their number one priority
786 2018-10-24 20:32:59 Not a good message that it’s okay for any member of public to shoot/kill/harm any animal in any way at all. A 00 licence for professionals that need it, but understand why village stocks would suit these self-justified dressing-up affluent ‘gamers’. Enjoy nature but get a console
787 2018-10-24 20:32:58 If you're looking for strong seasonal trends, buying stocks tomorrow should be on the radar.  The Dow has rallied 15/15 years from October 25th-December 10th.
788 2018-10-24 20:32:57 The top five stocks that closed lower today were $DXC, $RHI, $NVDA, $ALXN, and $NFLX.

792 2018-10-24 20:32:46 Nearly all stocks are pretty much down...
793 2018-10-24 20:32:43 Stocks tumble again. Thanks tRump for your tariffs MAGA.
794 2018-10-24 20:32:43 None of the attendees own stocks.
795 2018-10-24 20:32:28 Time to buy? I keep investing small bits in this down hoping it will jump again, but... It's been over a year and I've always been in the neg. Only like $200 invested spread around, always -$20ish? Hoping some of my cannabis stocks rebound. 401k has been stable, no gain or loss
796 2018-10-24 20:32:18 The audacity of army to clown the Big 3 stocks dropping. Bold of them to drag actual IPO’s with huge capital and that draw people to invest in them through the public. Something their faves CEO is desperately trying to do. 

As if the stock doesn’t drop every day. It happens.
797 2018-10-24 20:32:16 YKW I’m a little surprised #cryptocurrencies follow stocks so closely. initially, they behaved like safe havens - up when the market hits the sell-off territory. now they all just mirror stocks. maybe that does them more harm than good?
798 2018-10-24 20:32:12 The top five stocks that closed higher today were $VAR, $DTE, $JPNR, $NI, and $PEG.
799 2018-10-24 20:32:09 While the $spx has gone neg for the year, private prison stocks are up 8 days in a row... $CXV is up 5,5% ytd $GEO is up 2,5% ytd They both have dividend yields around 7%.

805 2018-10-24 20:31:00 This is an embarrassing admission - but after earning a fair amount of house money from crypto and stocks in 2018 - after today, I have given back all my gains and am now down .5% on my initial seed money. Ouch.
806 2018-10-24 20:30:59 uranium stock meltdown 2day. Been a bad week to hold uranium stocks - fortunately everything else is down as well. Nowhere to hide in this market.

810 2018-10-24 20:30:29 Wait until tax time next spring, when tens of millions see how LITTLE they actually got in the 2017 #TaxCut. The markets will respond when they sell off over-inflated stocks to buffer 401K losses as #TariffLosses start showing up in yearly reports.
811 2018-10-24 20:30:26 What a less then stellar month for stocks 
812 2018-10-24 20:30:22 "Dow erases gains for the year, tumbles more than 600 points as stocks extend October swoon."
813 2018-10-24 20:30:13 Stocks climbed too fast. Much of this is a correction. Too many overvalued stocks and bets being hedged with Trump not working out.

817 2018-10-24 20:30:05 When MSM has all day coverage on this.....beware! They are for the Dems only! Stocks fall during "crisis" too?  No one can die if these "bombs" are fake! Perhaps "planted" by desperate losers?

818 2018-10-24 20:30:02 did  old george soros brookage company do trading short , betting the stocks would go down.  I think Today was  staged to distract us and wake up the dems to go vote ,  he dieverted our attention with what happened today playing The victem card
819 2018-10-24 20:30:02 You should be worried. Stocks did NOT bounce back after the last crash a few months later. Consumer confidence is contingent on many things: Bombings, Journalists being brutally killed, trade being screwed up, violence being encouraged, housing slowing, rates going up, gas high.
820 2018-10-24 20:29:59 Retrait en 1h, ça prend dans le stock du magasin.
Livraison magasin, ça prend dans le stock du site.
C'est plus long mais les stocks sont plus fiables sur le site qu'en magasin.

823 2018-10-24 20:29:25 Congrats illegitimate @potus on creating such a toxic political and trade climate that stocks are plunging, jobs are being erased and farms are going under. @realDonaldTrump is a traitor and a global laughingstock even as he encourages his cult to bomb his foes. #impeachtrump
824 2018-10-24 20:29:19 there are just too many catalysts that could come to fruition.... if we get to January with no jump in pot stocks... then I may believe you on this extended cool down.
825 2018-10-24 20:29:19 Wait my stocks went up 
826 2018-10-24 20:29:16 Stocks are bombing yo
827 2018-10-24 20:29:15 Don't worry, stocks are still up <checks notes> 0% for the year
828 2018-10-24 20:29:10 Conspiracy! #democrats are selling more stocks than buying into the midterm #elections. Thus causing a correction making @POTUS @realDonaldTrump look foolish after taking credit for the previous #stockmarket gains. Can any politicians on the inside give me a  if I’m close?! 
829 2018-10-24 20:29:01 Good stocks on both sides, many sides...
830 2018-10-24 20:28:58 50 more point drops and DOW will be the lowest in the year. Trump's tarriff is greatly affecting the stocks exchange in a very negative way. Look at all the tech stocks dropping.
831 2018-10-24 20:28:50 Y los stocks?
Que pasooooooó??
832 2018-10-24 20:28:49 Note Stocks go up they go down and its an average try talking to someone who can teach you about this
833 2018-10-24 20:28:49 Find the Perp(s) and put em in the stocks till the rodents feast!
834 2018-10-24 20:28:47 Stocks down for the year - Obama and liberal conspiracy did it, or was it the caravan, Soros, the Clintons, Pelosi, fake news.  Choices choices choices.
835 2018-10-24 20:28:46 $TRVG had forecast of only 58% fade today. That s the reason I traded it small: sh at open 20cents avg, long scratch and aftenoon short 15cents avg from that. 70.
Only above 80% I trade size and above 90% I load the boat. Didn't shift supply/demand at 2pm, tech reason

839 2018-10-24 20:28:31 Stocks plunge again, wiping out gains for the year; technology swoon pulls Nasdaq 12 percent below August peak. [AP]
840 2018-10-24 20:28:21 STOCKS:  Even though Boeing and other corporation reported awesome earning today, the DOW dropped 600 points.  This is especially upsetting to trump and republicans who were counting on a booming stock market so "trumpee dumpee" could brag.
841 2018-10-24 20:28:18 @TheFive #Fed economists croon in Chair Powell’s ear: “stand tall, be tough, show Trump who is boss, raise rates!” So stocks tank and recession.
842 2018-10-24 20:27:50 Wow, @realDonaldTrump I can't take all of this winning.  BREAKING NEWS
U.S. stocks tumbled again, with the S.&P. 500 down more than 3 % amid a run of selling that has wiped out all market gains for the year.  I guess you only take credit when the market is up? #StockMarket
843 2018-10-24 20:27:48 I’ve always wondered how to get into stocks... so I think that’s what I may have to look into
844 2018-10-24 20:27:35 Stocks dropped for the sixth consecutive session, nearly wiping out this year’s gains. Now is time to dump Trump?
845 2018-10-24 20:27:30 Broader market not liking earnings season... Pot stocks are not leading the boat here... the broader market is leading pot stocks lower... some people have too myopic of a view....

848 2018-10-24 20:27:06 Stocks have BEEN plummeting!!! I've lost over $30,000 in four weeks! The GOP is once again showing it is inept at managing our economy!!! They're in it for the rich who can afford high risk behaviors. Democrats are more conservative with our economy & statistics prove it!!
849 2018-10-24 20:26:53 Guess Obama regrets his NV economy speech, huh? Also, what happened to all these ppl saying the market was good cuz of Obama, and now that it’s down it’s Trump’s fault? Give it a day or 2 the stocks will rise, and the same ppl complaining on here will give Obama credit again. 
850 2018-10-24 20:26:47 1: An Ugly day for stocks. SP500 -98.59 (-3.09%). Should have stayed with short. The model had a better idea. It showed too soon for at least an intra-month low. But a profit is just that. Tomorrrow is the first day for such a bottom. Should see a low no later than next Tuesday.
851 2018-10-24 20:26:40 Dow plunges more than 600 points in another day of losses, officially wiping out its 2018 gains

Technology stocks led the market deeper into the red on weak earnings reports from AT&T and Texas Instruments.
852 2018-10-24 20:26:26 Lots of green on my screen post-market after an ugly day for stocks.

Positive results from TSLA, MSFT and XLNX so far. Awaiting AMD.
853 2018-10-24 20:26:14 If reached, levels where I will latest switch to longs (stocks aren´t going to zero after all!) = SP500 2550-2570; Dow 23500; Nasdaq 6450; Dax 9500
854 2018-10-24 20:26:13 Stocks plunged and bombs were sent to some of the only people telling the truth in public discourse today.

If only someone had predicted these kinds of things would happen. 

You can change this. You can vote for Democrats this November 6th and restore sanity.

858 2018-10-24 20:26:02 Definitely. For dinner I mean. Not stocks.
859 2018-10-24 20:25:38 Stocks plummet because of worried investors about dems taking control of house.

861 2018-10-24 20:25:33 Stocks go up, stocks go down.
At least the Market isn't being Artificially Inseminated as it was under Obama with endless QEs.
862 2018-10-24 20:25:21 There is a HUGE demand for pot in Canada. There are long lines. But the stocks are going in the shitter. Total Manipulation. Buy #CRON now. Under 8.  You will be rich.
863 2018-10-24 20:25:20 Should I sell my stocks that I think will drop a lot more and buy more of my stocks that I think will only drop a little?
864 2018-10-24 20:25:18 3/3 IDA directly shows a dramatic change in feeding behaviour by humpback whales due to massive decline in sprat stocks off Cork coast. Is it worth it for €150 per tonne? What is the cost to the eco-system?

866 2018-10-24 20:25:05 every time stocks go down, they're basically on sale. if you're in it for the long run, buying Spotify today at $149/share is way better than buying it in Sept for $183/share.
867 2018-10-24 20:24:52 I made $1.04 off stocks today can’t wait to call my boss tomorrow and tell him I quit
868 2018-10-24 20:24:33 I do too so definitely recommend the ultra calming range. It’s not the cheapest but does work! You can have a consultation for free at anywhere who stocks Dermalogica (normally department stores) or use their online skin mapping tool.

870 2018-10-24 20:24:21 With stocks plummeting, Trump's violent rhetoric staining him, despots murdering American residents with impunity, Mueller prepping to spill the beans, how much would you wager @realdonaldtrump and his family are drawing up plan to flee to a country with no extradition treaty?
871 2018-10-24 20:24:19 Hey for anybody who doesn’t understand stocks. Everything gain was wiped today.
872 2018-10-24 20:24:16 People did not want the stocks today
873 2018-10-24 20:24:00 WASHINGTON: US stocks tumbled again, wiping out gains for the year in both the SP 500 and the Dow. The Nasdaq posted its worst day since 2011.
874 2018-10-24 20:23:40 Haven't been this many oversold stocks in the S&P 500 (76%) since January 2016.
875 2018-10-24 20:23:34 Stocks dropped yet again on Wednesday, as the S. & P. 500 gave up its gain for 2018.

881 2018-10-24 20:22:55 Bump stocks don’t help reload. They aren’t a very good product. They weren’t even selling well until the call to ban them.
882 2018-10-24 20:22:47 stocks above the 40DMA: 11%  sheesh.  I nibbled a few longs yesterday...all red of course except a $6 profit in $WMT...yes...six dollars

Skönt med lite volla så att inte endast mina aktier går ner. Värdeinvesterare gör oftast störst alpha vid nedgång.
890 2018-10-24 20:21:34 Im not sure we are really at that stage yet.

Yes stocks are down but full employment + company sales are up high single/double digits from last year.

lol....just a little 1er% pain at the moment :)
891 2018-10-24 20:21:34 The Nasdaq plummeted 4.4%, its worst day since August 2011, as tech stocks nosedive. 

The Dow plunged 608 points, or 2.4%. The S&P 500 lost 3.1%, closing down for the sixth day in a row. Both indexes are now negative on the year.

896 2018-10-24 20:20:45 Stocks are flat. Wages are flat. Inflation is up. Insurance is skyrocketing and farmers are on welfare. Plus we spent almost a trillion dollars on a tax break for the rich. After 2 years, America looks like what you would expect from any Trump business.

902 2018-10-24 20:19:59 If you have invested in any stocks, now is the time to consider we may have a crash coming soon. Very soon.
903 2018-10-24 20:19:57 Great time for those who neglected investing in stocks earlier in January!
904 2018-10-24 20:19:33 Stocks go up and down, bet you were silent when they were up?
905 2018-10-24 20:19:20 All my stocks in the Red today except McDonalds, I guess eating   and being unhealthy eaters is good for the economy! Yikes
906 2018-10-24 20:19:00 Holy cow... this one was a rough one.. Talking about the wars going on--Trump v. China. Trump v. Fed, Fed v. Stocks.. Lots of fights...all on the show..  @MadMoneyOnCNBC
907 2018-10-24 20:18:58 Yes we know that BTC has been chopping around hardly moving .. but the other day BTC moved over 20% up in a single day and a few days before that it moved 6% down in a day. Its still more volatile than stocks.
908 2018-10-24 20:18:58 this is true too that one will be well on its way to 250 by next week. all of these kinda stocks will hit last year levels and then some will be great opportunities fro pick up
909 2018-10-24 20:18:56 STOCKS PLUNGE...down 608 pts!
910 2018-10-24 20:18:56 Seems my witty banter has not excited #twitter today. Stocks red for the year. 3% seems to be the magic number in most drops. Gap open tomorrow then catching pianos time? Adios.
911 2018-10-24 20:18:48 Computers made the decision to dump stocks. So what?
912 2018-10-24 20:18:48 Stocks fall, losing an entire years gain, Saudi’s murder an American journalist, Russians are buying American politicians, FOX is spewing lies and hate. Evangelicals are endorsing murderers. America is in good shape!

916 2018-10-24 20:18:29 superlars34@hotmail.com  cell 928-254-9618. I would like talk to someone. all of the first three reps treated me like I was  dumb about trading penny stocks, The problem had to do with the  bid and ask , The bid and ask was frozen, They should take some training on penny stocks.
917 2018-10-24 20:18:29 With the bomb treats to the Clintons and the Obama's, and other democratic parties, some how the stock market is going down. So far the Dow and the Nasqa stocks are down 10%.
918 2018-10-24 20:18:28 Stocks did poorly today. I knew I should have grabbed my 403B early and just took the penalty. All yrly gains lost today. Nasdaq = 2011.
919 2018-10-24 20:18:20 Yes!!!! Please bring up Ron the Con spending tax payer money to appear at faux noise in NYC. Also bring up Don the Con promising to ban bump stocks but ended up toeing the NRA line.
920 2018-10-24 20:18:16 Well there are fully auto weapons and bump stocks ... I assume you know of these? Bump weapons seek to help the recoil, reload, and rapid fire abilities to make shooting faster, basically fully auto. @NRA wants technology on firing side. It belongs on gun control side.
921 2018-10-24 20:18:12 10/24/18
The sell-off in U.S. stocks accelerated, wiping out gains for the year in both the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, as mixed corporate earnings and weak housing data fueled anxiety that rising prices will crimp economic growth.
922 2018-10-24 20:18:07 Did you sale your stocks?    Can you share what is in the social security treasury?  Congress needs stop spending the taxpayers social security.   Not an entitlement. We pay into this.
923 2018-10-24 20:18:00 And while I’m in a foul mood – any shop that stocks mince pies in October deserves a dirty protest in their foyer.

928 2018-10-24 20:17:22 Ahhhh now stocks are important again
929 2018-10-24 20:17:20 RT CNNBusiness: The Nasdaq plummeted 4.4%, its worst day since August 2011, as tech stocks nosedive. 

The Dow plunged 608 points, or 2.4%…
930 2018-10-24 20:17:15 Stocks don’t equal performance of economy.  And who work for a FI network.   Lord have mercy.
931 2018-10-24 20:17:15 Just got two notifications on my Apple Watch.  1) Stocks tumble wipes out all of 2018 gains.  2)  Breathe
932 2018-10-24 20:17:12 Of course. Stocks went from 8000 to ~19,000 under Obama because dems are so bad for business. Must also explain why this is at least the fifth major plunge in stocks since trump took office and signed the #taxscam.

935 2018-10-24 20:17:09 Dow off 600 points. 
Tomorrow will pick up a few stocks like Fevertree, Craneware Water Intel. These I will sell again if I can make a small profit as still have high valuations.  Others like Scot Mort, Sosandar, Bloomsbury Pub, Adept Tech I will hold
936 2018-10-24 20:17:02 Stocks are down again in response to your inane economic policies. Since you like to brand everything, we'll call it the Trump Bear Market. #FailedPotus #FailedAtWharton #TheResistance

945 2018-10-24 20:16:18 How bout those stocks? Lol damn.
946 2018-10-24 20:16:17 Even if it is moving with other tech stocks right now I expect that to break.  Facebook is losing it's stickiness, especially among the younger demographics.  Instagram is helping, but has not shown it can be monetized as effectively as Facebook.  Plus they're running out of ppl
947 2018-10-24 20:15:53 I know absolutely nothing about the stock market but I know when reports say stocks are down and gains are wiped out it's not a good thing. Is it?
948 2018-10-24 20:15:45 Loved it--tech stocks and cyclicals both clubbed like baby seals. Now up 55% YTD. Just wish I still had on all my shorts that I covered two weeks ago and CAT puts sold yesterday. Would be up high sixties if hadn't covered those. Pigs get slaughtered though.
949 2018-10-24 20:15:45 Who blinks first?

951 2018-10-24 20:15:37 Mmm seems consistent with how djia and fb move during down periods. I also had msft and aapl in the SS. Seems like anyone could read that yes?

With sector stocks seems like fb didn't move down much more than rest of sector.

971 2018-10-24 20:13:16 Well things were going well till you ratcheted up the not so great tariffs. You can blame the Fed but 2% FF shouldn’t cause a massive sell off. Tariffs lead to higher costs, more uncertainty, and negate the Corp benefits from tax reform. Bad policy leads to bad results #stocks

1116 2018-10-24 19:53:44 Stock prices react very heavily to negative news that it may seriously stop average people from wanting to buy stocks.

1180 2018-10-24 19:40:16 100% of my 401k is in an 2060 index fund for a reason. (which is like 98% invested in stocks but who's counting?!)
1181 2018-10-24 19:40:09 After all the “New Highs” stocks are now down for the year, S&P 500. From 2010-2018, buy fear, don’t chase rallies.
1182 2018-10-24 19:40:01 #cody  I’m wondering wats would the stocks or Conversation#WWE has to say bout CODY RHODES and the MAN THET HE”s become....
1183 2018-10-24 19:39:50 It is a correction if the drop is temporary - then it is stocks at a discount right now. But it might also be catching a falling knife. That is when you as ...let's say a president, start regretting you took unduly credit for the stock markets rising in the first place :)

1189 2018-10-24 19:39:08 @SaraEisen Unfair question on oil stocks. The WHOLE market is being dragged down by PROGRAMMED trading as they ignore fundamental good earnings. That is the real story so not fair question. FED, CHINA, US$
1190 2018-10-24 19:38:31 Better: "Stocks are falling because the market has realized that this unqualified ignoramus Larry Kudlow is actually advising the president"
1191 2018-10-24 19:38:19 I took advantage of the market when it was high.  I cashed out some stocks.  I feel like I'm doing okay.

1197 2018-10-24 19:35:51 For the indices yes. But there are some stocks that this pushed them into ultra cheap territory. 

My guess is that some of these will bottom way before the market as a whole.
1198 2018-10-24 19:35:51 Yeah.  They have been talking about a recession happening the last 6 months.  Only reason Republicans are saying buy stocks is bc they want Trump to look good.  It’s all about to crash.
1199 2018-10-24 19:35:38 Stocks are now negative for the year.  #MAGA
1200 2018-10-24 19:35:31 To be honest, I'm a bit proud of myself. Shorting stocks was pretty scary for me, really way out of comfort zone, Now  I'm happy that I learned it before this bearish trend started. Today was simply perfect: $ARGX, $TWTR, $CPRT, $TSRO, $MU, all short trades worked very well.

1225 2018-10-24 19:27:23 This guy’s opinion is this is just one of the routine corrections I talk about in every update. Economy and market fundamentals remain strong. I assume it will bottom and rotation back into stocks will start any time. But nobody can predict what the market will do short term.

1228 2018-10-24 19:26:29 People reporting on “the economy” are usually old and wealthy. From a 24 year old who trades stocks for extra money: This economy is ass. Trump’s tax bill was a shot in the foot.

Of course, Private sector got screwed with stocks, raises at work, COLA increases anyway because nothing could help Obama's plans.
Now Fed purposely slowing Trump economy by raising rates right before midterms.
Any guesses why?

1308 2018-10-24 18:55:58 Energy stocks are getting very cheap but not yet at table pounding BUY levels. This is surely going to occur during the upcoming tax loss selling season.
1309 2018-10-24 18:55:39 missed the spike on $TRVG because I was so focused on $TTNP thank you @StocksToTrade for amazing real time data
1310 2018-10-24 18:55:32 Important Technical Developments

1311 2018-10-24 18:54:46 Sold $CUBE.C $CUBE.CA at 0.24. I might look into the MJ stocks to buy more $ACB or $EAST since they have been beated down alot lately
1312 2018-10-24 18:54:30 @realDonaldTrump Your trade war is killing the stock market, especially the chip industry. WHY?  Don't you care or are you shorting stocks?
1313 2018-10-24 18:54:19 So buying can be started in cash now for few fundamental stocks I think
1314 2018-10-24 18:54:05 What's been happening is foreigners have been buying stocks and corporates, which seems wise in a world where the US owes $100T in entitlements it cannot possibly politically cut.  If bombs are getting sent to pols today, try cutting social security and medicare by 30%
1315 2018-10-24 18:53:54 ce n'est pas que le CAC: 58% of the MSCI All Country World Index stocks are currently in a bear market (-20% off ATH).  34% for the $SPX
1316 2018-10-24 18:53:31 Our expectation of continued rising commercial oil stocks is occurring with this week a 6.3Mb build after a 6.5Mb build last week.
1317 2018-10-24 18:53:19 Stocks are fallin' again, sweetheart.
1318 2018-10-24 18:53:17 Stocks plummet as Big Biz realizes dt supporters have taken 2 trying 2 bomb humans. This could B start of The Planet of the Orangutans! If Dem voters get motivated & finally vote it could also signal the end of the GOP as we know it & totally neuter tiny fingers meaning REGS!
1319 2018-10-24 18:52:30 Penny stocks been hot lately. Maybe short sellers getting squeezed out by the big market on margin calls?
1320 2018-10-24 18:52:15 I'm going into the stocks and bonds business. Now issuing NON-callable bonds @ 0.01% annual effective with no coupons and maturing after 75 years. Hmu if down
1321 2018-10-24 18:52:05 How much does a pedigree pug sell for? They will have people feeding as and when. One, two, miss a few. It's still alive. Stocks in first. Organised crime comes in several packages.
1322 2018-10-24 18:51:41 My stocks decided to make a major dive today 
1323 2018-10-24 18:51:38 $XBI $LABU In these type market conditions you need to set limits. Stocks can and will go down further than you ever thought.
1324 2018-10-24 18:51:10 To be clear, and I've said this is my latest blogs, I still don't think we've seen the cycle high in stocks.   Not a flip flop bear here!
1325 2018-10-24 18:50:59 Trump : Larry, call that guy. You know, the guy, the funny guy with the stocks. Yeah, Cramer. And I'll call Jerry.
1326 2018-10-24 18:50:56 That's because Trump has stocks in AMAZON
1327 2018-10-24 18:50:35 Watching stocks rise 400% since 2009:

"I'm a long-term investor who ignores the short-term noise."

Watching stocks fall 10%in a month:

"I'm watching the 272-day moving average very anxiously. That level breaks and watch out."
1328 2018-10-24 18:50:25 I think his question was more around very long stocks to hold for future I guess, not for swing or short term holds that you usually prefer to do

1333 2018-10-24 18:48:16 awesome!
1334 2018-10-24 18:48:07 Amen Jeff....there's no rational economical reason to raise rates and the socio economic risks of doing so now with a weakening market for stocks,homes,etc is obvious.
1335 2018-10-24 18:47:56 nice!
1336 2018-10-24 18:47:55 It's rather simple. Reckless WH Policy killed a global recovery.  Killed the bull market.  Most stocks are at 2017 levels, some much worse.  Fox is afraid to tell the emperor he's not wearing any clothes!!  You can't pick a fight with the whole world!!!

1340 2018-10-24 18:44:44 Do you think the US stocks will reach 52 week highs as well?
1341 2018-10-24 18:44:31 The sell-off in #US stocks picked up steam as mixed corporate earnings and weak housing data fueled anxiety that rising prices will crimp #economic growth! #Treasuries rallied for a second day on demand for haven assets!
1342 2018-10-24 18:44:06 No alcohol stocks? :D
1343 2018-10-24 18:43:59 S&P down 1.2% and #lira is pushing towards a 1% gain on the day 

...usually, a -1% move in US stocks has such wailing and weeping that EM swiftly follows. #USDTRY raising eyebrows
1344 2018-10-24 18:43:59 I agree. I was short $SPY but covered on both whooshes lower.  Now theres just too many great stocks at much great values than just a few months ago
1345 2018-10-24 18:43:51 Either way I'm still very long on stocks.  We due The One, right?

1348 2018-10-24 18:41:32 #Chinastocks With China's Shanghai Composite stock market near 30% decline, its leaders steal from ECB chair, Mario Draghi's, 2012 playbook & declare 'Whatever It Takes' to buy time before next leg down. Meanwhile, US stocks' bounce appears weaker every day. Big tech fall coming.
1349 2018-10-24 18:41:26 So being subjected to a bit of name-calling is worse than 1000s of girls being raped?How weak and feeble are the authorities? We need to bring back the stocks...and stick them in there!
1350 2018-10-24 18:40:29 Ok Im sure U have regs on stocks 4 conflicts interest issues
1351 2018-10-24 18:39:01 I’ve honestly been just trading direction in index ETFs. Collecting premium on swings up or down. I’m looking at some stocks for earnings plays.

1357 2018-10-24 18:36:48 stocks with 2% move in S&P500 and eurodollars z9 moves 5 ticks, how is that even possible?
1358 2018-10-24 18:36:44 stocks down 30 cents since I BTO calls and the calls have gone up in value, gotta love movements in implied vol!
1359 2018-10-24 18:36:36 Until the investigation of this #bombscare has reached its conclusion, I will refrain from blaming any person or party.

In the meantime, I would like to know, who in the hell bombed #Wallstreet?

My stocks are doing piss poor for the first time since @POTUS took office.
1360 2018-10-24 18:36:21 When selecting stocks, remember: 1. Stocks go up when future earnings increase.  Sales doesn't matter, oy sales growth.  2. How much they go up depends on how uncertain those higher earnings were.
1361 2018-10-24 18:36:10 Trump says something once and stocks go up: Trump credit. 

Trump says something hundreds of times,and someone starts sending bombs: somehow not his fault.

1367 2018-10-24 18:34:33 The value of stocks depends on their productive assets, technology they own, etc... That is not tied to currency. Even if currency gets replaced the productive assets remain the same, able to crank out products/services.
1368 2018-10-24 18:33:01 My expectations for earnings on the “big three” tonight.                        AMD beats earnings but misses on forecast. MSFT does well on both.

1369 2018-10-24 18:32:31 Open a Vanguard account. Put the money into a wide-ranging index fund, something like VFIAX. Trading individual stocks is almost impossible to pull off if the goal is to be more successful than the market as a whole.

1384 2018-10-24 18:26:59 Rising interest rates, and home-building stocks have had their worst losing streak ever. Not just hurricanes.
1385 2018-10-24 18:26:46 Geiger Counter (GCL) pure uranium stocks Fund in London closed down 3.6% today at 21.00GBX. Volitility (VIX) index up at 23.
1386 2018-10-24 18:26:13 Macro funds/bots indiscriminately selling at 52-week lows.  Strategy is to keep pushing on these stocks until 1) something breaks technically; 2) chart looks like they have bottomed.  Momentum monkeys.  You're right. SLB at $53 while IOC's are generating massive FCF ... not right
1387 2018-10-24 18:25:56 $SYX trend pattern typical of many stocks - up big since Feb, then down big since Aug.  Buy-n-hold return: 11% LOSS.  Our subscribers locked in 28% long GAIN, have added 31% short GAIN.  = 67% tot GAIN, same stock, same period.
1388 2018-10-24 18:25:51 With number of the big dogs like $WEED, $ACB, and $APH down , and some of the smaller plays like $NINE, $GENE, and $EMC up 5ish%, I'm wondering if we're beginning to see these stocks start to move more independently rather than as a group. Still to early to tell
1389 2018-10-24 18:25:27 #Markets oh my.. Markets not even down 10% off highs and people freaking out .. We ain't crashing.. Its a correction.. Its a bull market, and we are going to make new ATHs .. Relax.. #spy #spx #trading #stocks #futures #ES
1390 2018-10-24 18:25:26 @kapil_tandon sir best thing ever happened for FII’s- launch of business channels here. Helping them find targets to offload their stocks very quickly than anticipated. Getting all funda analysts on TV and people buying on their calls as they are doing charity
1391 2018-10-24 18:24:47 The amount of money I’ve lost in stocks over the last week is obscene.
1392 2018-10-24 18:23:51 Hey. I am halfway between Swindon and Oxford near the White Horse. I am happy you are still producing it but would also be keen to try a few others if they are even half as good as Sherman IPA - so refreshing. Highworth has a great deli which stocks good produce.
1393 2018-10-24 18:22:32 trump's asking Wall Street "What's the matter?  Don't you love me anymore?"  Professional investors & corporate executives are selling stocks in record amounts.

1394 2018-10-24 18:21:55 Indeed, but this was all about plastic use, and how we reduce it in 28 countries. Finite stocks of helium are another issue, and we’ll miss it when it’s gone.

1399 2018-10-24 18:20:50 No need to get that high. They’re going negative next time around, when we’ll be hearing plaintive calls for the Fed to step in and buy stocks.

1402 2018-10-24 18:19:06 that gap n go in Deutsche Bank to new all-time lows is not something we see in uptrend for stocks. I would argue it's the type of thing we see when stocks are falling and risk levels are elevated $DB $EUFN $SPY $DJIA

1404 2018-10-24 18:18:24 @steveliesman Maybe stocks go down when Nate Silver guarantees a Dem House?  When NY sues XOM for climate change?  No?  It is a .25% rate increase?
1405 2018-10-24 18:17:37 Have realised my portfolio lost $1,000 in value over the past few weeks. Maybe it's time to stop being stupidly bullish on stocks?

(at least I can admit it)
1406 2018-10-24 18:17:08 Bound to happen when you announce you're going to double the circulating supply in the next month. Stocks do it with 2:1 splits, but the price per share also gets cut in half, so mkt cap stays the same.
1407 2018-10-24 18:16:36 As of 9113018, WSJ Page 89. Review 1000 Biggest stocks.  Now is the time to review ie Blackrock etc.
1408 2018-10-24 18:16:01 Some big name stocks seem to be approaching correction territory lately. Moving averages are sunk. As much as this is bad, I'm glad we're finally here. Watching for a bottom and holding cash money #stockmarkets

1414 2018-10-24 18:12:31 I think social media make some things easier, I can ask advice, it's a time suck though, so I probably could do more if I spent less time online. I've made ketchup and jam and stocks this year. My main issue with home grown is I lack freezer space. We are planning on buying a 3rd
1415 2018-10-24 18:11:46 I think this time is different:
Stocks crash
FED will be spooked
FED will call tightening off
FED will start QE cause loosening not enough
Dollar crashes
Bond market sells off
SDRs are back- very inflationary
Gold remains the only pillar
1416 2018-10-24 18:11:42 You gave up on trading stocks altogether?
1417 2018-10-24 18:10:04 $SMG. For those who can't trade straight weed stocks, it's a partial play because they sell to the growers. Also $STZ, which has a 38% stake in $CGC. For a pure sector play that doesn't actually "touch the plant" there's $KSHB  and $MDTR , both sell containers, vials etc
1418 2018-10-24 18:09:40 Crazy. I placed a small order to add to $vui at .265. It was part filled (about 1/3 of the order), and the ask went up to 30. Gotta love those illiquid stocks. It'll suck if you wanna get out of em tho. ;)

1434 2018-10-24 18:01:48 @therealtblake do you still use Robinhood for buying stocks? I remember you saying you had an issue with them. What sites/apps would you recommend?
1435 2018-10-24 18:01:47 New 52-week highs today, utilities, a few REITS, and $MKC, $HRL and $CLX. Safe haven stocks still work in a higher rates environment.
1436 2018-10-24 18:01:44 Valuations  - but why global stocks plunging more than US. Valuations much cheaper there
1437 2018-10-24 18:01:14 Whats Sanders net worth ? How his WS stocks doing these days ? Are we suppose to get pay raises when economy is great ?  Democrats Next story please ...

1440 2018-10-24 18:00:44 I don't understand this Joe! The NRA is dirty money and they were okay with the ban. Now, they are giving money against it? Your opponent knows it's not really about bump stocks! This attack smells like dirty money. I'm with you Joe! I see possible Russian interference.
1441 2018-10-24 18:00:02 Team Enough members joined the Student Gun Violence Summit this past weekend to #MakeAChange. Their demands include policy changes like a ban on assault weapons and bump stocks!

54% own stocks

tax cut helped pretty much everyone, not just the rich

people need to accept personal responsibility for their own mistakes-including debt

People should not expect to be able to take other people’s $.  There’s too much of that already.

1450 2018-10-24 17:53:32 Stocks are lower, (not by much) after abysmal economic news on the housing front. Meanwhile, an AWESOME amount of bond buying, the 10yr yield is 3.12, is going on. Can you only imagine what stocks would be doing IF some "mysterious entity" was not propping up bonds here?
1451 2018-10-24 17:53:20 I know, it's a real conundrum. I should rephrase: "..shouldn't be investing 100% in stocks."

Prudent though is if it's for a less than 5 year time horizon you should be 100% safe, unless you can tolerate a bit of downside (maybe home price would go down too?).
1452 2018-10-24 17:53:10 Complacency has a price to pay and stocks don't keep rising to the moon. They have to come down someday and that day has arrived. Today is the FOURTH trading day BELOW the 200 SMA.

1456 2018-10-24 17:50:59 A vote for Trump,  is a vote for terrorism. So, we're glad your stocks are doing well, and you can relax about too many brown people crossing the border; but make no mistake, THAT is what you're voting for when you vote for #TRUMP
1457 2018-10-24 17:50:53 I think Being financially independent,
1. No loans, No liability.
2. Should earn certain amount (without selling assets like stocks, gold, deposits, etc) to fulfill monthly expenses, insurances, medical expenses
3. Should enjoy life, do what we love.

I didn’t mean to say bump stocks. I meant to say an extendo clip. I do apologize for that. 
But we do all know bump stocks are nothing we really need anyway.

1480 2018-10-24 17:45:11 Ayo bruh I'm here to tell you that Canadian pot stocks were a bubble that just bursted, they're going down for 9-14 months. The infamous Tilray vertical day was the top, analogous to Bitcoin on December 17th

1483 2018-10-24 17:44:19 Bonds can still barely muster a bounce. Stocks are about to force a short squeeze in bonds. That is also when the dollar crash begins.
1484 2018-10-24 17:43:41 apple stocks rise by 69%.
1485 2018-10-24 17:43:10 Financial #stocks are weak. Look at the $XLF, you can see a double top and many financial stocks are looking weak.
1486 2018-10-24 17:43:06 Nobody now trusts the USA to have their back. This Trump administration cannot be trusted for anything.
Stocks going down while feeding them over 1.5 Trillion is the beginning of a recession made from debt,tariffs and bad leadership

1494 2018-10-24 17:39:29 To date there are no records of the FS Investors/@SoccerCitySD financing or building anything over last 10-15 years.

1495 2018-10-24 17:39:11 That's the nature of stocks.  I really don't get why kpop fans are so pressed about the stocks of these large companies.  Does their stock value influence how much you'll support them?
1496 2018-10-24 17:38:56 The #markets are looking not good. Maybe the end of the correction is near or we see a much stronger sell-off. No reason to trade #stocks at the moment.

1510 2018-10-24 17:34:24 Tip - research to see where the money is going and who’s making profits. If your not making money in stocks you have to restrategize your picks. You can profit with discounted funds that pay a decent dividend. I use monthly and quarterly dividends.

1535 2018-10-24 17:28:25 I continue to dislike consumer staple stocks, which are rallying today. The market is not factoring the economic reality that their cost is going higher (raw material, labor, energy, etc). They will have to raise prices to sustain their gross margin.

1537 2018-10-24 17:27:45 They're all geared up to short-sell British stocks. The best way to thwart that is to repeal Brexit now, while you can still afford pitchforks and torches.

"I'm watching the 272-day moving average very closely here. That level breaks and watch out below."

1575 2018-10-24 17:15:29 “There’s an index bubble with stocks inside many indices. So look to stocks that get dropped from index since off radar for #etf investors.” But as @scarletfu notes that means you own stocks active investors don’t like either. #ETFIQ
1576 2018-10-24 17:15:28 No one can counter ur argument cause it is 100% accurate. 

Tokenization is a scam trying to capitalize on craptocurrency fads. 

If these companies had to raise $ in the real world instead of the crypto bubble, they would be shat out the back of wall st like penny stocks $ostk
1577 2018-10-24 17:15:21 “When stocks fall, what do you do?”

 Hold and buy more, obviously.

1596 2018-10-24 17:10:40 Having stocks with a corporation says what?  Wonder how many would support Ford if it was not  a stock market ploy but instead truth of ownership by shares invested in a "company" instead?  2 sides to every coin I say.

1598 2018-10-24 17:10:05 School over-simplifies the concept of investing, day trading, and portfolio management.

It’s misunderstood that day traders or investors only have the option of buying low and selling high.

1609 2018-10-24 17:07:01 To be clear:  
I am far more bearish on bonds than stocks considered as a whole.  This is an inflationary period and certain types of stocks are an inflation hedge.  Bonds are certainly not!  Unprofitable concept type companies aren't either.  Commodity type names -- might be.

And what would support the value of these overvalued stocks turned over to the population. The debt?
I'm not a believer in this kind of scheme.
I think it more likely that everything resets to fair value. Replacement for fiat.

1676 2018-10-24 16:44:38 I don't know about over valued stocks - the P/E rations are well within reasonable rates unlike 2000-2001 when stocks were up crazy compared to their earnings. Higher interest rates will cause stocks to go down - each time the rate increases. 1/2

1697 2018-10-24 16:36:24 If you care enough to go back and delete tweets about individual stocks that turned out to be wrong, may I suggest that you probably care far too much about how people you've never met feel about you.
1698 2018-10-24 16:36:23 There's lots to be honest - far more stocks falling below 200SMA - way more 52 week lows compared to 52 week highs, plus lots of potential short set ups on my own scans compared to longs. Indices IMO are skewed and can give a false picture due to the way they are calculated.
1699 2018-10-24 16:36:08 These stocks can halve from here too. Even if they go up for any reason, AVOID.

1730 2018-10-24 16:25:50 My same thoughts. They were marketing themselves as being a tech company keeping up w/changes & all of tech stocks were inflated b/c of hope & dreams until the truth caught up with everyone

1734 2018-10-24 16:22:39 Yeah well, I'll take my chances. I think that might just be because the people winning it don't really know how to handle money. I think as long as you don't tell everyone and you make some solid investments (get some cash flow via real estate, stocks etc.) you should be fine.

1759 2018-10-24 16:10:05 Day traders make money from volatility and not from recognizing trends.

Anyone doing trend-analysts, while trading coins or stocks isn't really a daytrader, they're just speculating on short-duration price moves, which doesn't really work for most people.

1771 2018-10-24 16:05:38 That’s the reason all auto stocks have corrected this month, much more than correction in index.

1806 2018-10-24 15:54:48 just asked this nigga if he won any money and he told me to go buy some stocks smh
1807 2018-10-24 15:54:15 I agree. Things are starting to come together with custody platforms and regulations which are opening the doors for institutional money such as hedge funds. 

Next step. Tokenized stocks for increased liquidity and settlement.
1808 2018-10-24 15:53:47 @jimcramer  Hey Jim,

I bought Zuora at 27 and now it's down to 19 and I bought Marathon oil at $79.64 and now it's down to $68.81 Should I continue to hold these stocks?

1812 2018-10-24 15:52:15 Interesting action today. One thing I track is money flow, safety stocks, utilities as an example, broadly higher..may indicate larger selling on the way
1813 2018-10-24 15:51:28 TBD if stocks crash. Not lost on me that prior meltdowns in Palladium associated stock market crashes and the ensuing recessions, drop in global demand, especially for luxury items like cars 
1814 2018-10-24 15:50:53 Wrong and blatant propaganda. Stocks fell because of 3M earnings, Fed comments and housing slow down. Don’t become Fox News.

1830 2018-10-24 15:45:09 @PatrickWalker56 in times like this not we respect the market no matter how pretty the setup in individual stocks looks? Like $DG so tempting it just holding so much but the market conditions doesn’t help.
1831 2018-10-24 15:44:44 According to Jeremy Grantham's numbers, a 25% correction will drive stocks low enough to then afford a zero percent return over the next 7 years. Be careful about buying that dip.
1832 2018-10-24 15:44:43 No, but correlation between HY spreads and stocks usually high, especially in pronounced selloffs. It is rare for deeper problems to develop when spreads are still narrow.

1926 2018-10-24 15:18:55 @realDonaldTrump we all know this is to draw attention to left as last ditch effort to distract so call them out on this they have the resources to do it and we all know CNN is tanking go by up their stocks and put Christians n drivers seat!
1927 2018-10-24 15:18:09 Remember... The C.O.D. says: "stocks are NOT overvalued, they are just over invested..." OMG, you could not make this stuff up even if you tried!

Nearly all gains in indices erased since the beginning of the year. Nearly all corp #TaxScam stock buy back gains erased.

Stocks fall, Dow sheds more than 250 points via @YahooFinance
1933 2018-10-24 15:16:40 Only headline mgmt being done and stocks are bleeding in general as always
1934 2018-10-24 15:16:20 Yeah that's my view - Markets wouldn't like uncertainty around PM. I think a Brexit 'Deal' will be very positive for Stocks and boost UK Economy as Investment picks up again.
1935 2018-10-24 15:15:56 Can't wait till market close for @Tesla report. @elonmusk bought back 20M stocks few weeks ago at market price.  It will add now extra 1 Billion $ in his pocket today.
1936 2018-10-24 15:15:55 What are “stocks” and “bonds” and “investments” and what is “business” and “finance” and “money” and who are “bankers” and “traders”?
1937 2018-10-24 15:15:21 $AMZN $FB $NFLX so many stocks sitting just above very key support.  If these leaders break it will get very bad.
1938 2018-10-24 15:15:17 these are still lowest rates in 5000 years so I wonder if you are serious or joking? There is another problem going on beyond rates. Fake stocks are the problem and everyone wants them saved. Maybe the greatest danger is not letting them adjust regardless of blame.
1939 2018-10-24 15:14:46 I think the immediate problems are Brexit and US Midterms. Saudi is a non issue - the Politicians preen and flounce about but nothing will change - Strategic importance. Italy will be 'solved' by QE. Stocks historically rise with Rates up to a point - still early in cycle.
1940 2018-10-24 15:14:31 4) Time your trades

It is also important to pick the right moment to open your deals. Experienced traders enter the market when the volatility is the highest, which is usually in the very beginning of the trading session in case of stocks, indices, fonds and commodities.
1941 2018-10-24 15:14:21 I could have done without playing the 'find that file' game today.  I think I FINALLY have @StocksToTrade completely uninstalled, so hopefully when I reinstall it it will actually start.  For some reason windows thought it was open when it wasn't.

1956 2018-10-24 15:11:31 US stocks still weak.. NASDAQ still leading us lower.. Keep an eye on BTPs as they move further into negative territory, taking Italian yields higher.. This weighing on EUR again..

1962 2018-10-24 15:10:43 And here we go...after a mild opening, stocks are sliding deeper into the red. Enthusiasm fading over #Boeing's earns, and BA was responsible for the Dow's decent open.  Another selloff in FAANG stox, and homebuilders are now diving on new home sales -5.5% in Sept.

2055 2018-10-24 14:48:57 Dow and other markets drop.  People will now be buying valuable stocks at discount prices!   This is great news!  
2056 2018-10-24 14:48:50 Well the numbers are in and I think all the experts agree that @realDonaldTrump and the @GOP fucked up our amazing stock market run and now interest rates are going up and the whole economy is going to suffer. Industrial stocks tanking. It’s time for a change. Vote them out!!!
2057 2018-10-24 14:48:16 @larry_kudlow is spewing false partisan nonsense.  Stocks falling because of Earnings report, which indicates  the negative impact of Trump's tariffs.
2058 2018-10-24 14:48:15 And for raising the debt to levels never seen before while corporations are using it to buy back stocks. Workers raise hasn’t materialized. Rest of Americans tax cuts equates to $7-100 a pay period.
2059 2018-10-24 14:48:14 UGGG luckily it was a small loss on $BA -.65R, still going down now. Jumped in on a pullback to the 200ema started working then pulled back for a small loss below the 200ema. Was up 3+R  #OptionsTrading #daytrading #stocks #takethetrade #onegoodtrade

2065 2018-10-24 14:46:01 People who believe this lie should remember the promise he made to the parents and victims of the Parkland shooting when he said he heard them and promised stricter background checks and banning of bump stocks. 3 months later he made similar "promises" to students in Texas.

2067 2018-10-24 14:45:47 Hello our twitter seoulmates! We're sorry for not being so active in this platform. we mainly use FB & Instagram~ Anyway, we're so thankful for your support and as much as we wanna accomodate u all, we don't really have enough stocks. ㅠㅠ We still hope the best for u all! 
2068 2018-10-24 14:45:30 You should invest in assets that appreciate and create a cash flow, ex. Dividend stocks that have strong track records, that you then reinvest your payouts for compounding investment capital appreciation.
2069 2018-10-24 14:45:17 That's why I ditched my stops at the previous lows. Had a feeling this chop will be nasty but the stock prices were at a basement level. Decided just to ride out the rest of the volatility in good stocks.
2070 2018-10-24 14:44:44 Bhai mere, I said u r right earlier but as you said 'big companies' so you have answered the question.Stock exchange is for the big companies so shows how they are doing. 
Big companies employ a small proportion of the workforce hence the stocks going up/down don't affect poor :)

2140 2018-10-24 14:25:36 That last point, especially, is incredibly important. The idea that the Fed would change direction based on housing stocks is lunacy.

2191 2018-10-24 14:12:47 I watch the STOCK MARKET on a daily basis. Crazy thing is I dont own any stocks, I dont have a 401k. Not in the budget, but I do find it interesting.

2195 2018-10-24 14:11:48 But I won’t buy telecom stocks regardless. It is an immensely capital intensive industry with significant price competition. Also, I trade/invest what the market tells me and cut my losses fast if I’m wrong. Good luck with your $T holding.
2196 2018-10-24 14:11:08 Ok. You seem to have the effect before the cause. The stock market drives consumer confidence until CC gets very high. Then stocks become overvalued.

2241 2018-10-24 13:57:41 Interesting. 

It seems this kind of selling pressure occurs at two major inflection points.

1) breaking bulls back and entering a bear market from lofty valuations and overextended years of gains

2) near the end of intense selling as a climax occurs and stocks bottom

2283 2018-10-24 13:43:34 Stocks are falling because the economic policies of this administration are ruining this country. Trade war, the unpayable national debt, tax cuts for the top 1%, loss of cost-efficient agricultural labor. Investors can read and see this is a set up to fail badly.

2292 2018-10-24 13:40:47 0.25% return is much better than loss in such a volatile market. You should however try directional trade on stocks once  momentum picks up, with SL set on underlying.

2300 2018-10-24 13:35:30 Criteria used are relative momentum within a fixed universe of stocks and a roughness factor of price action. 

Preference is given to smoother momentum so a stock showing 12% spikes is actually penalized.
2301 2018-10-24 13:34:48 Great way to illustrate the difference between bidding up the price of assets and creating assets: money put into stocks vs. startups or money to purchase art vs. finance artists.
2302 2018-10-24 13:34:33 Interest sensitive stocks melting means they are expecting that bad news on activity is coming down the pipe already as cost of borrowing has risen. Fed will do nothing until they get some Econ evidence. Market might be saying more hikes are a mistake.

2317 2018-10-24 13:29:31 US investors are hiding in a few names. The US stock indexes should be much lower, to align with the rest of the globe, if not for the top of the pyramid stocks.  A real bottom will only occur when these beloved, market blessed names get crushed too.

2331 2018-10-24 13:23:03 Did you know that the stock market has been steadily improving since 2009? It's practically a straight line. There has been negligible change to the established trend during the past two years. But really? You own lots of stocks? Most Americans don't.

2340 2018-10-24 13:21:07 Having dividend stocks in your portfolio gives you a base of income to invest in new ideas every year. If you wanted to invest every quarter you could. I’ve held $PEP $OKE $NYCB and these provide me income when I cannot pull money out of my budget to make new investments
2341 2018-10-24 13:20:57 that's because the F'ing stock market has little or nothing to do with our economic reality.

And my transaction tax on stocks wouldn't be on the cash but on the individual share so a penny on a 100 shares of a $100 is only $1.00 out of $10,000 gross sale.. find a fault?

2380 2018-10-24 13:04:33 No valuations are used in this investing framework. 

Purely price based investing. 

I find valuation subjective but it is likely that after a prolonged correction/bear, it will be the value stocks that might pick up momentum first. System in that case will get into those first.
2381 2018-10-24 13:04:27 I'd invest every penny of it in stocks, and then begin distributing the dividends to places where it could do good. $1.6 billion earning 8% annually grows to almost $11 billion over 25 years. Even after 1 year $728 million could be given away without touching the principle.
2382 2018-10-24 13:04:18 Well, unfortunately as a holier-than-thou journalist, I don't invest in the stocks I write about!! Probably just as well. Good luck to them all.

2411 2018-10-24 12:50:53 They have a beef bc LM pokes fun at everyone, even conservatives and Trump and gun barbie. 
And point out the ideological fallacy of ppl who are 2a, but are ok when Trump wants to ban bump stocks or confiscate before adjudication.
2412 2018-10-24 12:50:48 Ahahahaa! They might us well buy stocks so atleast theyre earning ahahahaa
2413 2018-10-24 12:50:17 It means, more investors will pull out their stocks from other company and will buy more stocks on bighit since they can see how bts are in the market!
2414 2018-10-24 12:50:13 Toughest parts of momentum investing

Buying when everyone is selling
Selling when everyone else is buying
Sitting in cash when market SEEMS to be a grt value buy
watching stocks go up initially and buying them after they run up

If you can do all this , profits r guaranteed.
2415 2018-10-24 12:49:44 That's not why stocks are falling.   Do your job!  Kudlow said it but your job as journalists is to point out that THE FACTS ARE that Trump tariffs are hurting businesses and stocks falling are a result of that.

2416 2018-10-24 12:49:21 Again. Reputable and credible well established groups like SM, YG don’t need to announce every investor they get they are not desperate for investments. Clearly at how hard everyone wants black pink, and how news of EXO comeback makes SM stocks jump
2417 2018-10-24 12:49:18 Managed another at 78.5p but now they wont let me buy in bulk happy with 57k shares tho #Farn
2418 2018-10-24 12:49:13 Most people don't have time to be home studying stocks.   That is why they invest in mutual funds.   They have diversity and your money is put into different industries.   Rather than just one stock.
2419 2018-10-24 12:48:19 There’s actually an app for that too. But I think a big market correction is coming for traditional stocks!

2431 2018-10-24 12:43:13 Stocks were looking as if they would drop this morning. But Boeing earnings may have lifted sentiment. Futures now mixed following $BA results. I'll be talking about the markets with @ChristineRomans on @cnni just after 9am ET.
2432 2018-10-24 12:43:09 Prime Minister puts U.K. on war footing in case of #NoDealBrexit , to ensure medical & food stocks & “keep trade flowing”. Britain the first country in recorded history to declare war on itself. Now I understand the meaning of #Brexit Dividend
2433 2018-10-24 12:42:42 China Everbright, the state-backed manager of near $18B in assets,said the company is preparing to sell some stocks,on the concern that global valuations have already peaked.
2434 2018-10-24 12:42:26 Stupid sentiment, of course. Stocks are falling because they are overbought AF, its that simple
2435 2018-10-24 12:42:00 Investing can be confusing enough. Don’t go chasing “passive income systems” that make no sense. Start with basic investments like stocks, a small business or real estate. Start with something that has a proven track record.

2440 2018-10-24 12:39:48 Took enough money out of stocks a couple months ago to sustain me through a recession. Trump has pushed the US off a building. We only think we’re fine because we haven’t hit the ground yet, but it’s coming all the same.
2441 2018-10-24 12:39:44 if you are scared of 40% drawdowns, just do 50 50 stocks and bonds your drawdown in 2008 is about 12 % or so and since 1986 returns same (100 bps less or something like per anum) as stocks, but sitting on pile of cash is the most useless idea out there
2442 2018-10-24 12:38:55 75% of my gains come from 20% of my winning trades. Does the Pareto 80/20 rule applies to your P&L as well? I plan to write about that soon $SPY #stocks #trading
2443 2018-10-24 12:38:45 2 stocks up, 2 stocks down. 14% up on #VRS made even more tasty because its my largest holding
2444 2018-10-24 12:38:25 Let's change this to give the truth in the headline rather than this administration's lies. Stocks are falling due to tariffs. Earnings are lower, costs are higher and it will get worse as the full effect takes hold.

2447 2018-10-24 12:37:35 That's not  negative message at all. Sometimes in life, stocks go down.
2448 2018-10-24 12:36:40 If Joseph Goebbels we're alive today, he'd be taking notes. Socialism requires that businesses be state run (the opposite of Obama selling back all ownership of stocks after the bailouts). Republicans support a corporate welfare state, Americans don't receive anything in return.
2449 2018-10-24 12:36:03 Given that there are more players adopting risk parity, I can see why the strategy is losing its edge. What do you think on overlaying it to size the position on another algo i.e picking individual stocks?

2461 2018-10-24 12:29:33 YG is the pressed one. All his immature and embarrassing instagram posts make it obvious  And he can't keep BTS out of his mouth, especially when his stocks are plummeting.
2462 2018-10-24 12:29:19 So far, but he has been riding on the crest of a US economy wave, but watch this space. The markets are already twitching and stocks have been correcting their values down in the last few weeks. When the dollar starts to break we will see the real Trump...

2480 2018-10-24 12:21:12 I know. Still, some stocks will eventually recover because they're in industries that are far more sustainable overall than Hallyu, especially if they don't figure out a way to re-energize the image of the industry on the global market.

Come to #Missouri and interview soybean farmers, former workers at @harleydavidson in KC, or Mid-Continent Nail employees in Poplar Bluff. They will give you an earful about tariffs.
2489 2018-10-24 12:18:14 Dont get me wrong, I’d love to be bullish on PH stocks. No money to make during bear season. Kaya lang the market environment doesnt favor the bulls. So I step aside, trade a little, but not aggressive. Hindi ko po kagustuhan na bear ang market
2490 2018-10-24 12:16:45 I think these ent companies are also selling stocks to the international investors with a presumption that Kpop will take off because of BTS in the forefront. If you research each of the M3's stockholders, they include venture capitalists from China, Japan, US and Europe.

2712 2018-10-24 09:52:25 What is the average return of hedge funds this year? You find out yourself. If hedge funds short a stock like Tesla (production cannot meet demands), it won’t be good. If hedge funds look harder there are tons of stocks that we can sell short but not Tesla.

2715 2018-10-24 09:51:31 3/2 (lol) IMO To completely change the stocks I trade or try and new strategy would be a step backwards. I need to rediscover what worked early in the year and get back to that. The hard things is i have to remove the bad habits which have formed over the last 6 months.
2716 2018-10-24 09:50:46 @runadhm This year the timing for open category participants was excellent, only disappointment was the help from volini camp. No volini was available and we were told that stocks have finished, 
it had never happened earlier. Refreshment quality was also poor.

2730 2018-10-24 09:38:52 A portfolio of individual stocks is way riskier than even our highest-risk portfolio. It can therefore deliver a higher return in a strong bull market but will drop significantly more in a bear market. It’s not comparable with a globally diversified portfolio.

2737 2018-10-24 09:35:57 It basically means, the projected earnings weren't met or the earnings investors expected didn't happen. Maybe the projected sales were to high. But then again, the stocks of other ent. dropped too, one factor could be also is just that the stock market is down.

2804 2018-10-24 08:50:46 it's always the same. Over and over. Just the players,stocks and sectors that keep changing; revolving forever but obeying the same patterns over time.

2806 2018-10-24 08:49:48 Holding such a big amount of credit does not mean that the share prices will go up. All these stocks are normally pegged to S&P market cap and have positive correlation to each other.When S&P drops so does the market value of any shares under it.
2807 2018-10-24 08:49:17 The companies are spending way too much on their groups and getting way too little in return. Which IS NOT the case for BH and BTS. BH, even only having BTS, keeps going up while money and stocks from big are going down streaks
2808 2018-10-24 08:48:36 So even if they seem to be doing well as they see in the media but when the numbers or returns are low than expected, the investors will sell off their stocks for these companies so they won't incur loss but then it may result to reduced stock value.
2809 2018-10-24 08:46:39 3) Pension funds have used hedge funds as an alternative asset class to invest a small amount of the overall money managed. The idea is to “hedge” or to reduce overall risk. This is hardly a bad option given the tough time stocks had had from 2007 to 2009.

2835 2018-10-24 08:28:57 So the S&P 500 dropped about 0.5% yesterday. How do I know this? Not because I was paying attention or care. I know because I was getting emails from people who thought the sky was falling, wondering if I was going to write about it. Some people shouldn't be in stocks. 
2836 2018-10-24 08:27:56 Nevertheless, trading is one of the most amazing things in the world

3078 2018-10-24 05:44:51 The calls are fun. 

The stock action is going to be hard to predict but if I am objective more likely to go up. 

If the stocks runs up more probably not. Traders are buying to sell into the ER.

3286 2018-10-24 03:29:56 The problem is when you look at other countries such as Japan, China, and EU we see massive bond manipulation programs that have ruined those debt markets while propping stocks.  Who’s to say the Fed won’t go that route as well?
3287 2018-10-24 03:29:45 Trade Setup 
Above 10270, Bulls will have positive bias for 10350

Below 10250-270 area, Bears will use bounce for selling towards 1010-10140 levels

Trade premium if you want to leverage beyond 1x or get really steady conservative return on large accounts. Otherwise, hold ETF/stocks and deploy the massive time savings elsewhere.

3376 2018-10-24 02:31:15 But the good news however is that I am buying a lot of stocks on the stock market and buy companies with low values and hope to get big time cash off of that. So that way not only have money but also when I do get married, nobody has to worry about weeding budgets.

3387 2018-10-24 02:26:25 @etsai3 and margin too the same sec rules apply especially when u buy non marginable stocks and 100% marginable stocks..
3388 2018-10-24 02:26:10 Lol. No, I have always looked at his watch list to see how it matches mine and I dont always trade the same stocks he does. I actually blew my accounts following alerts in a chatroom from someone with bigger following than him.
3389 2018-10-24 02:24:11 Seriously? Stocks rose steadily during Obama's administration with his stimulus policies. The truth is stocks have been volatile this year, bc capitalist corps know Trump doesn't know what he's doing. Think tariffs and Trump kissing Putin's ring at America's expense.
3390 2018-10-24 02:23:51 What's changed for the markets from 11,700 to 10,100?
- People are talking about stocks a lot less now. Nothing else.
3391 2018-10-24 02:22:54 All above make sense only and only when you have stocks to sell at peak of bull market and money in pocket at peak of bear market.
Otherwise it's only gyaan!

3393 2018-10-24 02:21:10 U.S. Market Check

    U.S. stocks closed lower for a fifth day, as an afternoon rally from the lowest levels for the S&P 500 since May fell short of pushing benchmark indexes back into positive territory.

    The yield on 10-year Treasuries were little changed at 3.16 percent.
3394 2018-10-24 02:20:52 - Asia stocks mixed
- Treasuries edge up; dollar firms
- Oil to 2-month low 

BLOOMBERG
3395 2018-10-24 02:20:52 Asian stocks traded mixed Wednesday after a late-in-the-day rally dragged U.S. stocks off their lows amid concerns about the corporate earnings outlook.

Benchmarks were little changed in Japan, Australia and South Korea as U.S. equity futures slipped.

3412 2018-10-24 02:07:30 So you only buy stocks for right now? The trick is to get in BEFORE the plans are out there. By then it can be much higher. You know that. And btw he said he does have plans. Why are you so bitter? Why bash? The $WWIO guys aren't bashing you. Stay classy
3413 2018-10-24 02:07:27 It surly wasn't him. He had more people living in abject poverty cause he had a vested interest to make sure China got ahead in their economy. He was investing in their stocks to make sure he gained millions while the rest of us lost out dignity.

3416 2018-10-24 02:06:35 Common. Price correction is inevitable in markets. Many quality stocks down so much. Let's reinforce Asset allocation, homework & patience
3417 2018-10-24 02:06:16 All 3 major Wall Street indexes were trading below their 200-day moving averages, a key technical indicator of long-term momentum and all 11 major S&P sectors were in the red on Tuesday, continuing what has been a punishing month for US stocks
3418 2018-10-24 02:04:44 Thanks. Maybe worth a campaign to get ABC to include “externalities” in their financial reporting: Amount of remaining forest cover, extent of reef die off, decline in fish stocks, arable land. Etc. Businesses need to know this stuff. @AlanKohler
3419 2018-10-24 02:04:00 Play safe tomorrow in stocks or options ,  it’s very dirty at this moment.
3420 2018-10-24 02:02:39 Regulators can't enforce their rules if it causes the stocks to go down.   Just no longer kosher.
3421 2018-10-24 02:02:01 Not if they buy the dip. Or bitcoin. Or cannabis stocks. Oh forget it.
3422 2018-10-24 02:00:38 Yep.  That’s what happens in a correction. But stocks are certainly falling hard on bad earnings or guidance!
3423 2018-10-24 02:00:36 October 24, 2018: As of 9:55 a.m., PSEi 7,156.86 down 40.76 points or 0.57 percent PSEi opened at 7,185.83 #PSEiupdate #PSEi #stocks
3424 2018-10-24 02:00:36 Stocks were falling because there were fewer buyers than sellers at the previous price level.
3425 2018-10-24 01:59:35 And there's nothing he can do about it. The Fed doesn't want to make the same mistake that led to the last crises, and he can't fire him. Checkmate-the Fed is doing the right thing, if it's not to late like the last time. #Stocks #Rates #Fed #Economy
3426 2018-10-24 01:58:42 This is a highly misleading headline. Go back to journalistic standards. You’re affecting the health and future of our very democracy when we have an autocrat in office. Should say, “Misleading statement by WH on falling stocks.” Then state the truth.
3427 2018-10-24 01:58:38 @larrykudlow no, stocks are falling because corporate earnings missed the mark, because of tariff wars, because of escalating tensions with Russia, because @POTUS @realDonaldTrump tax policies are failing & debt is rising.  Shall I go on?
3428 2018-10-24 01:58:07 Thx for posting; All stocks ? Wilshire? Where do you get data from? Thx.

3435 2018-10-24 01:51:15 You have to basically assume that you will lose all...it is high risk.  Or, you have to cut losses very fast.  It’s not easy when you play high beta stocks.  But no risk, no reward.  Just the way it is.

3448 2018-10-24 01:44:53 bitcoin is a better store of value than either real estate or stocks. no idiosyncratic risk.  Bitcoin will be come to be understood to be  money and people ultimately will hold less in the way of those assets. I would not own gold at all, Bitcoin has already replaced gold.
3449 2018-10-24 01:44:12 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
3450 2018-10-24 01:43:49 Yep higher rates will do that. Look at the auto stocks. Have been predicting this for s while now

3452 2018-10-24 01:42:51 Fundamentals will play the final role.If they are good, stocks will survive..if not then will become crap. A cartel of businessmen, politicians,beauracrats & old players sponser these.There's a big cut.Last part- only to minor extent.Not as much as these whatapp msgs say
3453 2018-10-24 01:42:11 The realization that... playing stocks is like playing neopets back in the days... except you only get to play between 930am - 4pm EST, and it actually matters ... sorta

3506 2018-10-24 00:59:38 Fiat is already dying, that’s why stocks are used as a store of value, and cap rates on real estate are absurd.
3507 2018-10-24 00:57:57 Yes, I mean so many major Chinese stocks are heavily down since YTD based on this expectation. How low can they go?
3508 2018-10-24 00:57:10 Went through more than 200 stocks and found only 3-5 promising ones.
3509 2018-10-24 00:55:58 At this point I'm optimizing for time and minimal mental load, so a majority is in dividend stocks / ETF and I sometimes sell puts in selloffs on those dividend stocks or general market.
3510 2018-10-24 00:54:45 The stocks of 75% of the companies reporting this quarter declined on the day of reporting.

starting competitive so late
Never making the PAC tutorial series i wanted to make for PAC in smash 4 (gonna do it in ultimate)
and Taking 0 Stocks in the PAC Vs cloud crew battle
3512 2018-10-24 00:52:51 I have 2 of those stocks
3513 2018-10-24 00:52:44 This happened to me in a ladder match a few Big Houses ago back when I still played ICs. We restarted and went back to the same stocks, but I've always wondered what would've happened if it was in a real bracket.
3514 2018-10-24 00:52:13 One of the few stocks to break out today to new highs
3515 2018-10-24 00:51:50 Asia stocks edge up as Wall St. shows resilience, oil near...
3516 2018-10-24 00:51:41 I never understood why people put some much emphasis on sales and you're just a consumer. No stocks in the company. What do you get out of it?
3517 2018-10-24 00:51:26 On regarde pas les news, la news arrive pour que ceux qui ont fait pumpé le stocks puisse vendre tranquillement leur action. 
3518 2018-10-24 00:51:24 Not good for stocks! push it out from that channel
3519 2018-10-24 00:50:42 The deficit...which was higher under Obama, the debt...which doubled under Obama...the bond market...which is normally depressed when stocks grow like crazy...the "recovery" which was slow as molasses until Trump took over?

LOL yeah, tell us about economics.
3520 2018-10-24 00:49:49 invest even more into stocks but buying a building to develop a real beat/hiphop scene in the valley would be crazy.

3523 2018-10-24 00:49:14 True Story:  hey remember when John Adams said Washington should be chained and tossed in the stocks?  Good times.
3524 2018-10-24 00:48:34 .@IronStache calls for "sensible gun reform," saying he thought everyone wanted to ban bump stocks. He backs policies like background checks and 48 hour waiting periods.
3525 2018-10-24 00:47:47 Yo also my spacing and movement today was looking SO NICE. My neutral was also better than it usually is but my disadvantage state was just sucky which is mostly why I would lose stocks. I also dropped a lot of punishes but that was likely just nerves.
3526 2018-10-24 00:45:02 only my ETFs have been doing good this month  the rest of my stocks stay on a consistent low
3527 2018-10-24 00:44:47 With burger retiring our ruck stocks are rather thin why didn't essendon make a play for a braydon pruess who is a big bodied 23 years for support for bellcho
3528 2018-10-24 00:44:07 It was completely bonkers...you should've been around to witness the craziness...Internet stocks traded on things like number of page views instead of earnings
3529 2018-10-24 00:44:05 Since Oct, breadth has been weak with advancing stocks leading on only 4 of 17 occasions. It was important that we did not have a really bad close today on volume, but the bears are still in control. When markets decline sharply, a bottom doesn’t form overnight.
3530 2018-10-24 00:43:49 How lucrative is the #cake business really? El Classico #mudcake - flour, eggs, choc, labour 2-4 hrs/cake. sequential production cycle possible. For something like $10-$15 total cost, retail $8 a slice or $70 for a cake. Don't buy stocks, bake cakes. Is my deduction wrong??
3531 2018-10-24 00:43:31 Sir any link to warning and dangers highlighted before such cracks came in these stocks...I really missed.
3532 2018-10-24 00:40:48 Wrong on so many levels. Rates would be at 0%. Stocks are being held up artificially
3533 2018-10-24 00:40:36 Asia stocks edge up as Wall St. shows resilience, oil near two-month lows
3534 2018-10-24 00:40:34 Perhaps Powell is related to one of the many millions of frail retirees who used to be able to live off of CDs and treasury bonds. Getting interest rates back to quasi normal levels means granma no longer has to gamble her meager retirement on stocks...
3535 2018-10-24 00:40:28 Yea, there stocks are at an all time high this year but your right, their dead
3536 2018-10-24 00:40:05 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
3537 2018-10-24 00:39:44 Guys, this is not something to joke on. Please don't take Loans to invest in Stocks unless you have independent income to pay back the loan. Please.
3538 2018-10-24 00:38:28 Who can give me some information on buying stocks in Jamaica
3539 2018-10-24 00:36:55 I read interest rates are the cost of money, higher rates make it more expensive to borrow money. Businesses can’t borrow & grow as quickly. 

Also interest rates go up and bonds seem more attractive, money goes out of dividend stocks into bonds. But I could be way off
3540 2018-10-24 00:36:23 Last time they denied because of too much price volatility, no custodial solutions and very little volume on futures
Now we have bakkt coming, coinbase is approved by NY for custodial and we have fidelity
As for volatility, stocks are now more volatile then btc
ETF is a done deal
3541 2018-10-24 00:36:05 Big company given funds to buy back stock, middle class pays for it and now cuts back on nonessential items due to lack of funds, stocks will then fall, and both business and middle class get screwed? Is this how a recession starts?
3542 2018-10-24 00:35:54 Market at index level is still not cheap considering the current valuations vis a vis historical ones.
Individual stocks are giving an opportunity. 
Investors should utilize the current bear market to pick up quality stocks at good valuations.
3543 2018-10-24 00:35:49 Expectations... based outlook... Verizon: met expectations, revenue slightly beat... In China: fell 29%... Shanghai: 4% gain... Dow dropped 126.95 points, 5%,25,317.91... S&P fell 11.9 points, 2,755.80... Nasdaq: Fmr. Strength in tech stocks:
3544 2018-10-24 00:35:39 Are you still into stocks?
3545 2018-10-24 00:35:09 If you have never had Stocks Butter Cake, do yourself a favor and do so. Thank you @rulmer25
3546 2018-10-24 00:34:15 Dear @ICICI_Direct, please stop sending me custom alerts. I know my stocks are making new lows every other day #Bears 
3547 2018-10-24 00:34:08 I don’t gamble w/stocks! Never have. I like my $ safe in CDs. I get some interest, never loose $ and sleep well at night!
3548 2018-10-24 00:32:54 #stocks  About three-quarters of the stocks in the S&P 500 are currently in bear market territory, people who say dow or S&p are only off 7% are clueless. So many stocks off 20% or more
3549 2018-10-24 00:31:38 So. The market is affected by the fear monger omg Republicans. Hmmm. Doesn’t it make fear mongering illegal when it’s designed to drop the market? So interesting to see which millionaires and Trump ( on the small chance he actually has money) moved stocks to avoid loss?
3550 2018-10-24 00:31:23 Brian at some point they'll be right but its relative. In late 2014, the Fed verbally stepped in to stop a RAPID sell-off in stocks. But unemployment was 5.75%, CPI 1.3%, stocks 35% lower and since then financials conditions have eased!

3553 2018-10-24 00:29:24 heart disease drug and impotence medicine stocks skyrocket
3554 2018-10-24 00:29:13 The one thing is, they're saying they're doing this because stocks are overvalued. So it doesn't sound like they're dumping A shares. U.S. stocks most likely
3555 2018-10-24 00:27:35 I should invest more money in stocks
3556 2018-10-24 00:27:27 The stocks probably went up because the for-profit insurance companies suddenly got 20 million new paying customers basically overnight.
3557 2018-10-24 00:26:34 My brother can land in the hospital if he touches a peach, and she still stocks the house with them.
3558 2018-10-24 00:26:03 Companies spent money buying back stocks, not increasing employee wages, or they gave one time bonuses instead of raises.
3559 2018-10-24 00:25:39 Ruck stocks pretty low.. what’s @NATRAT42 doing next year?
3560 2018-10-24 00:25:35 I agree 100% with that. Pelosi said openly in an interview that she hoped that banning bump stocks would lead to a slippery slope. That’s the problem. People think, Oh...no big deal. Who cares about them.....before long you have a precedent set on banning things & opens the door.
3561 2018-10-24 00:25:23 The value of my shitman stocks rise daily. I advise you buy early
3562 2018-10-24 00:24:58 Agreed, he wants to repeal Obamacare and ran on it. It’s a bad deal for Americans, why does anyone believe insurance company stocks went from $50 a share before Obamacare to over $200 after Obamacare. The model doesn’t work and even the current Medicare model doesn’t
3563 2018-10-24 00:23:39 A portfolio of 3 to 4 multicap funds is more prudent.
It will give an exposure to small cap stocks without extreme volatility of a small cap fund.
3564 2018-10-24 00:22:37 Was it venture capital that he provided or did he purchase stocks off the TSX?
3565 2018-10-24 00:21:30 For trying to intervene in sexual assault... B.) 2nd Officer dies after ambush attack... C.) Stock futures plunge amid geopolitical tensions... DOW: triple digit loss, 5 stocks out of 30 companies... 3M, Caterpillar, Boeing, Apple, GS all posted
3566 2018-10-24 00:20:26 @Nicholas_Merten keep talking stocks on the channel. It educates crypto investors to look across markets. Not just across crypto. Good stuff.
3567 2018-10-24 00:18:38 5th day in a row the stocks were down...you are a disaster at economics
3568 2018-10-24 00:16:56 Money, debt, stocks, etc are claims that can reflect either legitimate contributions of labor/tools or obligations to monopoly. Conventional concepts are not nuanced enough to make sense of important issues, so I'm sticking to the georgist distinctions.

3572 2018-10-24 00:13:41 I still think big pharma makes horrible calls as well for acquisitions standpoint, rushing into buying expensive companies without due diligence (like we rush to buy stocks thinking its bottom). zsph juno few examples good companies keep getting expensive in the mean time

3582 2018-10-24 00:07:12 Don’t have chart in front of me but wealth increase since crisis is mainly via stocks and fixed income.  Ppl levered to real estate don’t live paycheck 2 paycheck unlike 2004-2007. Retail sales mainly driven by rich folk. Rise in rates not an issue for consumption or UST demand
3583 2018-10-24 00:06:39 One final question to you. Please be frank and honest: Do you even "invest your OWN MONEY" to trade stocks? Or you just "write" blogs and "charge monthly subscription fee" in the premium service to make $$? Just asking. & please don't block me!!

3586 2018-10-24 00:03:17 Happy Wednesday. On @BloombergTV 
- Citi's Asia investment bank boss live 0900HK; Philip Morris CEO on at 1040
- China stimulus drip feed continues, APAC stocks near bear market
- Erdogan rejects Saudi story, Trump defers response to Congress,
3587 2018-10-24 00:03:13 Sadly for the Democratic candidate, he’s NOT accused of permissible offenses:
- sexual assault like Kavanaugh 
- spending millions for his security like Pruitt
- owned stocks of companies he regulates like Wilbur Ross.
He’d be off the hook w/permisible offenses.
3588 2018-10-24 00:02:31 Invest in tear gas, rubber bullet and firehose stocks.

3590 2018-10-24 00:01:30 Meanwhile, Nike stocks are through the roof. Harley-Davidson's business is suffering because of Trump's dumb tariffs. I thought Republicans were all about free trade?
3591 2018-10-24 00:00:55 Did the little girl also mention that stocks are currently trading at 52 week lows and the market just had its worse month since 2015? Or that tariffs really are hurting farmers? And the deficit is higher than ever and interest rates are increasing? Lara, go back to shopping.
