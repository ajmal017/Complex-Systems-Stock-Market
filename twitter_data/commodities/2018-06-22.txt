13 2018-06-23 21:15:11 While you watch corn grow, innocent children are in child internment camps, the President and his family are self-dealing and new tariffs are being placed on our goods and commodities.  Great job Chuck!
14 2018-06-23 20:59:32 Poppycock , money was created by the traders trading goods and services . Government had nothing to do with it . Traders only accepted commodities such as gold , and silver as their medium of exchange because they a value that would always be in demand . Bitcoins are a hoax .
15 2018-06-23 20:41:58 Humans can NOT be compared to trade. Trump (along with a myriad of other things) needs to stop that. Humans are NOT commodities on a market.
16 2018-06-23 20:38:46 It's not that people being able to afford such superficial commodities is dooming the generation. It's their choice to do it. The value of these items is miniscule and so is their sense of money. Again I am not attacking him, just bringing light to an issue.

38 2018-06-23 20:21:58 If Anderson and a Howard are their goalie targets, things must be bad. #Isles need to goalie and top D. Two of the most precious commodities in the NHL.
39 2018-06-23 20:18:14 Must be why stocks are in a bull mkt... Sure, correction in EMs but not fatal as yet.  Crude in major bull mkt and commodities.
40 2018-06-23 20:10:32 I have a machine that can process nearly any material and output pure commodities (great for tires, scrap, metals, etc). DM me if you want to chat.
41 2018-06-23 20:10:04 da fuq. maybe it's a sign to start trading commodities.
42 2018-06-23 20:05:28 except higher prices on the same wages. My medical premiums are up,gas is way up, ag I work in steel and Ag  commodities, and that's killing us to. Worst potus ever!! #GOPTaxScam #Cult45 #trumpcrimefamily
43 2018-06-23 20:05:06 That's pretty sad. As for "bought" players, they are not commodities. They chose to come here to make a better future for their families. They had no guarantee of selection. Once eligible they had to earn it like anyone else.
44 2018-06-23 20:04:55 Fantastic draft by the Wings. Snagged both big fallers (Zadina and Veleno) and got big skill with Berggren and solid defence prospect in McIsaac. Not to mention picking up one of the hottest commodities at the draft, Ryan O’Reilly!
45 2018-06-23 19:53:35 Still wonder who they never contacted French intelligence for comment.  What we do know is that all of these insurgent groups engage in transnational illegal commodities trafficking.  It stands to reason that, if it has value, they will traffic in it.
46 2018-06-23 19:50:31 This pilot is in connection with the eventual set up of a #blockchain based #commodityexchange focusing first on agriculture commodities. It will revolutionise #commoditymarkets in #Africa as current exchanges don’t work due to high costs and lack of liquidity.
47 2018-06-23 19:50:20 And meanwhile, our food keeps going up, gas keeps going up, clothing keeps going up, CHILDREN ARE IMPRISONED, 

all commodities are going up, up, up! So glad you have pissed off everyone around the globe! 

BUT MEXICO WILL STILL NOT PAY FOR THE WALL!
48 2018-06-23 19:44:26 When u complained about fuel scarcity they did something? How about price hike of all commodities? Exchange rate nko? Abi nepotism... I'm coming let me chill this zobo fess
49 2018-06-23 19:44:26 There were specific references to pit traders at my father's shop and commodities. That continued at Fidelity in New York and Dallas.
50 2018-06-23 19:41:00 I think the angle could have been to speak on cost of living, availability of basic commodities, difficulties of having cash etc. I expect all these EDs and Chamisas to be ordinary people who shop and buy at chicken inn. Lets focus on issues affecting citizens.
51 2018-06-23 19:36:48 Viento de cola? Fue el que tuvieron los K cuando las commodities estaban por las nubes!
52 2018-06-23 19:36:13 Alabama & Georgia passed draconian immigration laws which cost them over $140M in crop losses.
ICE raid are going to bankrupt small businesses who can't get workers.
Expect food and commodities to increase.
Trump's economic expertise is through bankruptcies, not profit.
53 2018-06-23 19:34:40 #IRAN BANS IMPORTS OF 1,339 COMMODITIES TO MANAGE CURRENCY OUTFLOWS AS RIAL/USD EXCHANGE FALLS: TASNIM. #OOTT
54 2018-06-23 19:24:47 As dollar hits a new record in #Iran’s black market with each #USD exchanged for about 80,000 rials, Iran’s Trade & Industry Ministry bans imports of 1,339 commodities including cars, cosmetics, clothes & textiles,... to manage outflow of currency & to protect domestic producers.
55 2018-06-23 18:57:40 2-3 years back, #Walmart wanted to enter Indian food retail and commodities market. Politicians and people fought back tooth and nail leading to not allowing Walmart an entry. They said this was to protect the unorganized 'Mandi' food retail market. 
In 2018 things have changed..
56 2018-06-23 18:42:43 Opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth
57 2018-06-23 18:26:41 Kinda like what the CFTC just did. Like IDGAF what y all think here is what we consider virtual currencies and yes please all of them are also commodities.. 

Such a cluster.
58 2018-06-23 18:15:21 Silver didn't deviate that far from commodities as it did in 1980. A bubble is a bubble. A mania is a rare event.
59 2018-06-23 18:05:03 3238: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
60 2018-06-23 17:55:27 Hahaha yes, well noon kasi di afford ng parents ko na manood ng mga ganyan, even bilhan kami ng toys, 'di nila magawa kasi priority ang basic commodities. So un. Hahahahaha.
61 2018-06-23 17:40:44 Well, you need to stop holding them asap. If it were me, I would close the southern border all except for commodities that flow to and from that border and take care of these children and teens with have in our care. Find their parents. Bring them together again.
62 2018-06-23 17:39:32 Great call. Adding another kid with leadership and brains is a great idea, no matter how tall he is. Speed, skill and IQ are valuable commodities in this league, not just being over 6 ft and 200 lbs.
63 2018-06-23 17:36:54 What about using crypto that is backed by commodities?

Not gold-for-the-sake-of-gold, but by commodities that are useful for their physical qualities.

I've been chewing over the idea of a token backed by bio-diesel.
64 2018-06-23 17:28:22 Poor little pooter, Sarah. Maybe the Trump Regime needs to fix her up a commodities food box. You know, the ones with dried beans and rice that they want to replace SNAP and WIC with.
65 2018-06-23 17:23:37 Given that commodity prices external to the EU are lower than within the EU and given that on various commodities attract EU import tariffs, I fail to see how Brexit can be inflationary.
66 2018-06-23 17:18:44 You  guys do realize the American securities and commodities markets are being held up by thread and sticky tape, right? Pulling the air out of the #crypto markets keeps a bit more capital in these overvalued companies....this isn't coincidence.
67 2018-06-23 17:16:02 Which TRAIN? The one that’s killing Filipino  little by little due to high prices of commodities?! That one is a real killer! Hahaha
68 2018-06-23 17:14:56 There is no link between immigration and wages. Cost or living is primarily reflected by the availability of commodities and largely by the energy market. You are economically illiterate.
69 2018-06-23 17:07:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
70 2018-06-23 16:44:37 Assino embaixo, Andreazza: ele surfou na onda das commodities e na casa em ordem deixada por FHC e depois no segundo mandato abriu as porteiras do crédito fácil, também mal aconselhado por Dilma, então ministra da Casa Civil.  E agora se apresenta como salvador da pátria...
71 2018-06-23 16:40:13 Hmm can’t we distribute to a different country. These are commodities
72 2018-06-23 16:37:56 my attention, my instruction, & my time are all hot commodities. 

they do not come easily or freely. 

pay me to even consider.

73 2018-06-23 16:22:14 You’re making broad generalizations about business. Amazon provides cheap commodities to consumers. If you’re shopping for batteries, pens, reusable water bottles, you’ll probably buy from Amazon.
74 2018-06-23 16:09:19 I repeat 3% is not high.
Would you not expect the BoE to take action to keep inflation down?
It is generally considered that Brexit will be deflationary rather than inflationary.  UK will be able to buy commodities globally without EU protectionist import tariffs.
75 2018-06-23 16:03:55 400 million.. our population  keeps inflating like price of commodities in our country
76 2018-06-23 15:56:34 in the national and global black market, children are seen as commodities.  Child trafficking is one of the two most profitable criminal businesses in the world.
77 2018-06-23 15:52:47 Commodities + Ecosystem. 

As a payment method there will be many less and less services, for more concrete things. 
If there is one that is used for daily it will be btc, for cross-border transactions, more expensive things, etc. 

FIAT and CRYPTOCURRENCIES will coexist.
78 2018-06-23 15:52:12 I knew there was money to be made, and promises for votes. Human Trafficking by our President allowed by the @GOP congress. Just commodities in capitalism as we all are to the wealthy.
79 2018-06-23 15:39:28 Petróleo e mineração? Beleza, commodities os caralho, mexendo com a matéria prima bruta do país, mas correios mano?! Monopólio de serviço? Pra que velho
80 2018-06-23 15:37:36 I love this, Mango. It's so easy to criticize when you live in a country with A/C I'm your home, all commodities, help if needed, safer than others, great education... If you haven't gone through what these families have gone through, your arguments to denigrate have zero value.
81 2018-06-23 15:36:51 Did you know, the "My Account" page allows you to easily track your orders against grants, budgets, commodities, labs, professors, etc.

83 2018-06-23 15:25:49 Here’s the quick guide to what you should learn from FASTEST to SLOWEST... 

1. Crypto 
2. Commodities 
3. Shtocks 
4. Forex 

101. Bonds 

Pick the speed you want. Speed = risk as well. #oott
84 2018-06-23 15:24:33 Today.... 

Prospective goy: Gav, I’m green. I wanna be a daytrader. What should I learn? 

Me: do you want super crazy fast moves or something you can wait for a few hours? 

Goy: hmmm... i prefer fast.. 

Me: trade commodities ie OIL
85 2018-06-23 15:12:34 Totally agree.......  I think and hope all Farms would try to fit a ‘sustainable’ goal whether it’s succession, soil, money and/orbusiness plan...right now marketplace pays  ‘$0’  in premiums for any sustainable practices for our commodities....  Organic clearly does
86 2018-06-23 15:06:56 Coffee is among the next set of Apps to be rolled out. All commodities under @narouganda s mandate are under consideration.
87 2018-06-23 14:52:01 This is a great platform for investors of Trade    Shares,    Indices,    FOREX,    Commodities    and    Cryptocurrencies. #Diro #DiroToken #DiroLabs
88 2018-06-23 14:47:11 Depends on what you are trading. If you are trading commodities / forex / stocks & certain crypto you can SHORT them. If you have a long position in bitcoin at 11,000 & downtrend starts, you can close it at small loss & wait to reenter at better price
89 2018-06-23 14:33:08 Drugs do not relax you, they turn you into a consumptive addict who relies on commodities to remain socially functional.
90 2018-06-23 14:28:28 Venus will enter Leo sign on 4th and will be under the aspect of Mars. There will be rise in the rates of Gold & Silver. The demand in the grains & commodities like peanuts & sesame will be noticed. Sun will enter Cancer sign on 16th, Monday and thereby conjoin Mercury & Rahu.
91 2018-06-23 14:08:45 @realDonaldTrump Just because you see your children as Trump commodities and could abandon them without remorse, does not mean other humans have so little heart. Grief & pain of parents & children are real not a "hoax"
92 2018-06-23 13:57:05 Trump, Sessions, Miller & Nielsen have no interest nor plan to reunite these families. Since they barely consider these kids & their parents human, better to use  them as commodities for their contractor friends to enrich themselves on. The rest of the GOP are secretly cheering.
93 2018-06-23 13:46:32 Farm Bills are typically corrupt, IMO. Only largest of Commodities Growers can "dump" so much product on market that prices would crash. But those same entities receive a $-subsidy covering $-difference between Historical Price & Market Price. @cspanwj

96 2018-06-23 13:37:13 ¿Cuántos TLC firmó Macri desde dic. 2015 a la fecha? El criollito quiere que le compren sus commodities sin comprar los de los demás. Si los demás no venden sus commodities, ¿cómo piensan los criollitos que le van a comprar los de ellos?
97 2018-06-23 13:35:42 I've been in commodities for 20 years so take your school of hard knocks somewhere else.  I have skin in this game and know better than most about the disconnect between book learning and reality when it comes to real world pricing of crude.
98 2018-06-23 13:31:27 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
99 2018-06-23 13:26:25 Maybe some of the usual tRump bowing, scraping, and kissing up to tyrants and dictators will help. Of course the U.S. oil industry needs a high price to keep producing and pay their workers. Who knew that international commodities markets could be so complex. #DotardAtTheWheel
100 2018-06-23 13:21:19 'caring + empathy' are commodities
101 2018-06-23 13:16:14 I have actually never met a feminist in person. Though I have met a lot of women who support "Women Empowerment" , which usually means working in corporations (or getting a job), and consuming commodities.
102 2018-06-23 13:11:53 "Commodities that give investors the highest return [...] are the kind of commodities that produce #NCDs" companies are driven by investors + equity firms, and some of largest investors are pension funds @llonakickbusch #WHA17 #enoughNCDs #commercialdeterminantsofhealth
103 2018-06-23 13:08:39 Sa umpisa masaya, kasi malaki ang palitan. Pero after a while, prices of commodities will catch up.  Lalo na dito sa atin, most raw materials are imported. Fuel prices are also up, may TRAIN pa.

Not an expert. But I think, wiser to keep ur investments in foreign currency for now
104 2018-06-23 12:52:42 Well what exactly are you implying? What I am sure is that you said that commodities cannot be traded, when I corrected you, and then you said they are. I'm not the one who should put my money where my mouth is.
105 2018-06-23 12:52:20 @Alealex78 MARIO TÚ NO ERES SILVA, ERES SOPLA, TE A COMMODITIES EN 4 PATAS, CÓMO UN SAPO, SOPLANDO INDUCIDA, POLVO Y MOSCA!!!
106 2018-06-23 12:44:11 Well said Andy, honesty and loyalty are rare commodities these days, keep doing what you do.
107 2018-06-23 12:43:10 Girls bought as mere commodities for just 1k-2k to be pushed into flesh trade.. Age of d girls - just 12 @ChangeOrg_India @YouthKiAwaaz #chokethedemand #forumforchange
108 2018-06-23 12:37:21 Another way we see that Facebook is about profiting off social connections and data gathering.

Facebook does not give a fuck what happens to us. Zuckerberg doesn't care about us as people.

We are commodities to them, to be exploited and thrown aside as desired.
109 2018-06-23 12:33:16 Thts no excuse to stealing. What she stole are not basic commodities those are luxury goods. Filming her was wrong though
110 2018-06-23 12:32:28 @ScottElliotG Hi Mr. Greenberg. As someone who has "cost disease," a paranoid obsession of rising costs of goods and commodities, is there any possible reason you can provide for why the economy has evolved this way? Thanks.
111 2018-06-23 12:32:06 @narendramodi modiji, here are few suggestions from me for Mann ki boat for 24 June 2018.
1) Please find a way to reduce petrol and diesel prices as the rice of these, hikes the price of essential commodities such as vegetables and dairy products.
112 2018-06-23 12:28:55 College education and a happy meal are incomparable. They are two different types of "commodities". College education can lead to enormous scientific and medical discoveries that may help take down the price of a happy meal. It is not easy to monetize such contributions.
113 2018-06-23 12:27:46 Now with the 1st round done, what has been clear so far : Centers are priorities for many team as they are the highest commodities.  Just remember there's still days to go. But at the very least they addressed the hole you all have been shitting on him for not doing. #Habs

116 2018-06-23 12:17:27 You're answering your question. Carry over surpluses of all commodities, favorable weather both in the US and in competitor countries, and rising dollar value all work against grain prices.
117 2018-06-23 11:39:04 Fur Example; Here in Le Ukraine...
Farming, Agriculture, Commodities...
Health Care, Education, Transportation, Utilities
Military, Christianity, Families, Housing...
SIMPLE.
118 2018-06-23 11:35:08 There's nothing revolutionary about doing drugs, they make you addicted to capitalist commodities.

Assuming you have no existing in-game capital, if you wanted to farm enough commodities to buy a $15 monthly subscription you would need about 35 hours of monotonous grinding, not including time spent working marketplace.

For $15

140 2018-06-23 09:21:50 Womens bodies are not commodities. God, the housing system is stacked against women. Glad you and @pollyn1 are raising the issue of homelessness/insecure housing and it's impact on women.

151 2018-06-23 07:19:02 Okay so here is how it works. It works only during strong trends. Doesn’t work always. Whenever something goes up or goes down with force it will bounce again, retrace to 23.6 / 38.2 for forex / commodities & 50% for crypto & again bounce or dip to retest the high or low.
152 2018-06-23 06:30:38 Our economy has not been revived yet, its worse than when you met it. There are more hungry, unemployed Nigerian's now than before. The cost of commodities are higher than before. Truth be said our economy is yet to be revived. Ask Nigerian's on the street and the market place.

May be good for those earning dollars, initially. Prices of commodities will eventually catch up. Fuel, FC loans, anything imported will cost more. Gov't loans will cost more, money that could have been used for other things will be used to pay gov't obligations.
155 2018-06-23 05:52:34 But you have to watch out for commodity cycles. It can whack you out. Difficult to predict better market judge on its own rather then being brave . Takes a long cycle in commodities to return .

169 2018-06-23 03:21:52 Those that consistently go long/short...or simply are market neutral (small % trades long or short) are NOT part of the crypto community. They are closer to the equity long/short, forex, or commodities communities than they are to crypto

171 2018-06-23 03:10:04 Cops aren’t working class for the same reason prison guards aren’t prisoners.

They’re a militia for the rich
172 2018-06-23 03:05:25 This is a legitimate question. I have taken the same meds for maybe 3 years. They change prices every month, usually by 5 to 30 cents. Sometimes as much as a $1. They do not seem to be different manufacturers. Are medicines priced like commodities somehow? It drives me nuts!

186 2018-06-23 01:44:43 I'm not sure I agree with you.  A machine already has some value, since it was previously made by labour. When used in production, it passes its value onto the new commodities.  However a machine does not pass its total value, since it is not used up in making each product. .....

189 2018-06-23 00:48:32 You are wrong. We care about American children who live in poverty. We care that immigrant children are victims of human trafficking. Out of 12000 children, 2000 came with family, the rest were human commodities. How is that compassionate?

228 2018-06-22 21:34:01 Thx!  Real threat IMO is what they’ve been doing past 4 yrs: Use USD surpluses to lock up future supplies of commodities, real assets globally, which they will eventually price in CNY & therefore gain 100% control over their current acct, making a CNY currency crisis impossible.

231 2018-06-22 21:22:53 These people use children as commodities They are experts in deception
232 2018-06-22 21:20:41 To me is more a hedge against the current financial system rather than anything else & it has some advantages over gold.

The current system already has instruments to hedge against inflation. Eg you can buy commodities, short bonds, you can sell your currency for another one etc
233 2018-06-22 21:20:38 There was a really interesting thing in a long ass mostly pointless UN report about building circular economies on a large scale to turn waste products into other commodities that is probably worth stealing
234 2018-06-22 21:18:51 Trend is up primarily because the year-over-year change in oil is up. With oil stabilizing, the YoY change in oil will soon stabilize as well.

Inflation is really an oil/commodities play.
235 2018-06-22 21:12:45 She also said “as I reflect on my part in this atrocity (the allowance of the proliferation of private prisons) I genuinely regret that I didn’t use my political influence to keep profiteers from making commodities out of the suffering of the most vulnerable.”

236 2018-06-22 21:06:54 @WarrenBuffett @JeffBezos @jpmorgan stoked to see you guys enter Healthcare.  What do you think of at-cost business model?  Transparent pricing on commodities w/out markup, vary price for talent.  This is counter to business, but lays foundation for healthy returns.
237 2018-06-22 20:54:41 That’s an ignorant statement you made.  There’s no such thing as “foreign” minerals. Ask someone who trades commodities.  Similar to oil.  Minerals, oil, commodities are global markets. We live in a global market. Trump is too ignorant to understand this. Global market.
238 2018-06-22 20:53:10 $TECK I've loved commodities, and I've been trying to figure out a non-microcap, diversified way of playing it. Teck is exposed to oil, which is great, but also copper, zinc and steelmaking coal. Oil is on fire, but copper and zinc are also sexy. In at 34.54, target of 38+.

359 2018-06-22 13:33:30 Just saying...what’s the point in rolling with old and ineffective commodities at center? Unless they plan on starting Aldridge at the 5 and have Kyle Anderson bulk up a little to play the 4? That could work. But they would still need decent backups. Pau and Joffrey ssssssuck!

361 2018-06-22 13:32:25 It really worries me how emerging markets are affected by geopolitics and $USD, as they are quite fragile despite the commodities rising prices in a sovereign debt bubbled world. This remembers me 2008 when non 'investment grade' failed and created a cascade effect.
362 2018-06-22 13:30:52 Every soybean farmer needs to remember this debacle. You cannot tell a crop not to grow while The Head Tweeter offers the Chinese telephone money bail out as US sales of fungible commodities plummet and tariffs are threatened. Voting crazy---Never forget!
363 2018-06-22 13:30:02 From Daily: Currently, after a big run in the dollar (UUP), it broke under 25.00  and closed right on that level.
If works its way below 25.00, that should be better for commodities, which are still at historical lows compared with equities.
364 2018-06-22 13:24:30 It all boils down to Australia being a very natural resource rich and driven economy. Lots of mining, lots of big customers (think China etc) . Commodities/real assets show a lot of sensitivity to inflation/growth

367 2018-06-22 13:15:40 People are not commodities, but their labour is. If their work is just barely more valuable than what a robot can do, why do they "deserve" to be paid much more than the robot does? Employment is not charity, it's for mutual, voluntary benefit.

401 2018-06-22 10:53:59 I guess the point of the original faulty graph was that regardless of the absolute returns of commodities vs. stocks, these assets should be uncorrelated (or negatively correlated) and mean reverting - thus there should be benefits to having them both and yearly rebalanced.

470 2018-06-22 03:09:33 What if this whole thing is a simulation. what if we just a prototype world and the real people are out there creating different commodities of the “perfect” world. and once they have manufactured the perfect world they’ll pull the plug on ours??!

478 2018-06-22 02:06:15 its pretty upsetting knowing you probably wont see 2019.all the things that wont be done, silly things like getting kissed or hugged are suddenly priceless commodities that i wont have the luxury of having. Sad really
479 2018-06-22 02:03:23 A few of best still available —Musa, Robinson, Melton, Simmons— are unknown commodities to average fan, but all *fun* players. Couple of known names, Wagner & Brunson are solid, but love some of the guys that may be in tge 2nd Rd: Bruce Brown, Frazier, Diallo, Graham, Carter.
480 2018-06-22 01:50:42 @DSjuggerud Steve, I watch Ur interview promoting commodities. I'm not into commodities, but I love Ur presentation. I am promoting my unique approach 2 100% workforce engagement. The West falls apart w/o it. Our facing depression can reverse. How can I arrange 4 a talk as yours?
481 2018-06-22 01:42:03 It's heartening to hear of a vulnerable GOP representative who has a conscience and a spine.  Rare commodities in that party.
482 2018-06-22 01:24:53 He is your saviour? In what way? The price of commodities went up the poor are targetted killed and nowadays forget your tshirt you will get arrested and if lady luck is frowning at you, you may end up dead. So working class saviour or eliminator?

487 2018-06-22 00:48:41 XD beautiful capitalism at work. Itll have you pay $300 for a piece of technology over food for a month. Too bad commodities and non profits rarely get the same treatment due to no innovation, not enough money, etc.

Or is that what republicans think of their OWN children? No wonder they grow up to be republicans.
489 2018-06-22 00:34:15 Only way I’d travel abroad with electronics these days: Burner phone, cheap laptop. Devices as single-use commodities.
490 2018-06-22 00:19:06 I’m Referring to sudden changes in such things as resource prices for commodities like as oil and minerals or for the example the unilateral imposition of tariffs on softwood limber, steel and aluminum by US Administration which affect certain provinces more than others.
491 2018-06-22 00:17:23 Yep, there are the most undervalues commodities out there and always manipulated by the bullion banks in capping the price of silver and gold through over supply of derivatives of the physical metal, working together with major CB to help to restore confidence with their policies
492 2018-06-22 00:15:57 Better to draw M1 with commodities
493 2018-06-22 00:10:21 I *wish* I could remember where I read this, but someone yesterday said that racists like to eat at Mexican restaurants because Mexican food, and the (generally) Mexican-heritage staff who work there are commodities to them; something to be bought--thus not their equals.
494 2018-06-22 00:04:47 Mr. Chancellor If you want the UK to trade with the world and gain great economic growth you have to create a Pound £ financial system that trade with every other country’s currency for commodities and investments.

534 2018-06-24 22:03:12 Once you generalize people and assign a label to them they become commodities. Those in power then no longer consider them to have rights - they are just something to be used to serve their agenda. We must oppose this commoditization of people.

536 2018-06-24 21:56:14 Maybe not in the short term but the last 2 inflation cycles were caused by high energy prices. Energy is the main component in the production of gold and other commodities and finished products. Rates can only rise so much to suppress this. Not complicated.
537 2018-06-24 21:54:31 #Emergency of 1975. I was 14years boy from a lower middle class  family in Mumbai. All that I could remember till now d plights of common man, people were not getting essential commodities like rice, sugar & kerosene 4cooking, with the gallon tin we used to run after the tankers.
538 2018-06-24 21:44:05 Well, that "threat" is affecting the global stock markets as well as prices of commodities that are vital to many people.  Maybe THEY'RE overreacting, ya' think?
539 2018-06-24 21:31:34 A era do Governo Lula, foi extremamente agraciada pelos elevados preços das Commodities, dentre elas Petróleo a US$ 130, Minério de ferro, Soja, voracidade de compras da China.

543 2018-06-24 20:48:45 For clarification... range-bound prices & lack of volatility for many commodities gives the appearance of manipulation trying to keep prices from moving higher (particularly for the prec metals).

547 2018-06-24 20:42:08 Since late 2013, the strategy has clearly been "Anything but UST's."  Google "China buys..." - they've been stocking up on commodities, real assets, utilities, oilfields, etc.
548 2018-06-24 20:34:31 Isn’t it quite insane that when prices of commodities increases due to scarcity or any other reasons, it never reduces afterwards.
549 2018-06-24 20:32:47 Over the past few years. Prices of basic commodities and foodstuffs have increased significantly but salary remains the same.
550 2018-06-24 20:30:36 Physically the same. Embodying a different process that leads to the end product.
As far as buying commodities at low prices. You and I both know that in macroeconomics we avg. the price because suppliers can also sell high. So long as they are withing a functional operation.
551 2018-06-24 20:25:48 No. Mr Jeremy to stop crisis the west must learn and stop bombing their countries. The refugee crisis was created by UK, US and France bombing countries in Middle East and Africa who were never a threat to us but we took their assets and commodities
552 2018-06-24 20:23:56 I think it comes down to the specific editor on a book. Some can mentally project an artist’s work onto their project, trust the writer’s or interior artist’s suggestions for cover artists, and see art and time as valuable commodities. Others don’t. I’ve seen it work both ways

558 2018-06-24 19:55:10 It has long been said about politics in the Middle East, the two most valuable commodities in the region are oil and water.  The vast amount of water that the Red Sea/Dead Sea Canal brings to Ammon could make it very rich indeed. #Jordan #economy
559 2018-06-24 19:32:13 Unit of account has nothing to do with generally acceptable credit instruments (or commodities) exchanged & priced by reference to it.

561 2018-06-24 19:29:37 Because it prevents a large chunk of the population to be employed which will cause a huge dip in the commodities market. When that happens, we'll see a shift towards the production of capital goods and inevitably that leads to market saturation.
562 2018-06-24 19:28:47 Hype(r)reality: the function of a film might not any longer be to be watched, but to act as a promotional plane that lends lustre to spin-off commodities.

563 2018-06-24 19:27:11 GMO’s are for medicine not for food. All foods produced using GMO technology should be labelled so that consumers can distinguish between quality food produced for the human palate to enjoy & industrial foods produced for commodities exchange.

576 2018-06-24 18:22:49 President Trump has stated that he wants to see barrier-free trade. The reason he imposed tariffs is due to the lop-sided nature of tariffs placed on certain commodities by America's competitors/trading partners.
577 2018-06-24 18:20:40 Cause trump doesn’t tell you he will increase incomes or lower taxes accordingly as commodities rise. Because your boss won’t do it for you. So thank the person doing the thankless job. #MAGA #MigrantWorkers

586 2018-06-24 16:58:07 Your guide to commodities insider trading 
587 2018-06-24 16:47:14 Data is one of the most valuable kind of commodity today. No exchange allows for the trading of data, yet. $borealis #Iceland #commodities #BigData
588 2018-06-24 16:32:23 #GOLD $GOLD A dominant bearish trend as long as the price will be below 1283.95: stay short or open new sell positions below 1280 with 1261 and 1248 as a targets in extension. A monthly close below 1278 will lead to 1236 as a target in extension (1215). #commodities $XAUUSD
589 2018-06-24 16:24:19 Bottom trick for Bear market:

For those who want to play safe & buy only on trend reversal try this:

Plot 5EMA & 12EMA in daily. Wait for 5EMA to crossover 12EMA in daily on upside. Buy the dips after crossover. It works the best in Commodities market. Didn’t try in Crypto 
590 2018-06-24 16:24:14 More about the loss of purchasing power of the #USD than demand for commodities.
591 2018-06-24 16:21:19 The reality: antiModi forces making more noises, stability of prices of every day used commodities, infrastructure development, ease of getting cooking gas, railway tickets, low air fare. Only secular ideology to show by the opposition. Modi to win in 2019, handsomely.
592 2018-06-24 16:20:23 - SEC says ICOs are probably securities;
- CFTC says tokens are commodities, unless they are securities;
- IRS says they are property;
- FinCEN says tokens are money.
I support @GeminiDotCom founders - a non-profit organization needs to be created to regulate #crypto
593 2018-06-24 16:18:49 @freddy590451 commodities,parece una propaganda de toallas sanitarias.
594 2018-06-24 16:15:57 Immigrants legal or illegal don’t take jobs from us citizens. You simply believe what trump says but research shows he is wrong. Without illegal immigrants the country comes to a haunt and you start paying 40% more for most commodities grown in the USA.
595 2018-06-24 16:13:31 People needs to realize @SatoshiLite has been used to trade commodities before starting the @litecoin project. Nothing wrong with spotting when it's time to run with the money. Well, he didn't run away. He still contributes with building $LTC. Thank you.
596 2018-06-24 16:05:04 3235: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
597 2018-06-24 15:59:34 And I will concede that a longtime incumbent polling in the low 40s is not generally a good sign. Weird that a poll between two well-known Floridians has both consistently in low 40s. Are undecideds that high among such known commodities?
598 2018-06-24 15:52:48 Equalization has nothing to do with the price of oil. I can just as easily say "the price of canola was what then". Or lentils, pork, lumber, lobster, crushed stone, whatever.

If someone starts basing EQ on the price of commodities, it'll get ridiculous real fast.
599 2018-06-24 15:47:41 Trading commodities only no stocks for me
600 2018-06-24 15:28:52 it is of Paramount important for the government to established National  price control Board to be vested with statutory power to fix the prices of Goods and services and other essential commodities.
601 2018-06-24 15:27:40 A thousand times this!

What if THERE WERE NO COMMODITIES what if we just had things we needed like 

Dream big people!!
602 2018-06-24 15:23:50 Great Depressions are Passe Date . What's coming is the 'great readjustment' .The value of Fiat will be reassessed versus tangible commodities and Precious Metals especially with regards to foreign exchanges between countries.
603 2018-06-24 15:21:42 Vou conferir,mas Laura Carvalha disse q Lula surfou na onda do mercado d commodities e desconsiderou q foi o mercado interno o maior impulsionador da economia;e sobre junho/2013,não viu relação entre as descobertas do pré-sal,os interesses externos nas estatais c/as manifestações
604 2018-06-24 15:18:59 Selling #commodities make you poor #AfricaRising #AfricaDay , start adding value and sell finished products @TanzaniaInvest
605 2018-06-24 15:18:01 #Coffee FYI: 
Coffee is the second most sold commodity around the world. Coffee stands second as oil (fuel) secured the first place in the list of most sold commodities around the globe.

606 2018-06-24 15:05:20 Maybe he left them out because that "immigration" was even worse in that the immigrants were not "just" the scapegoats but forced from their home, completely dehumanized, and then traded like goods or commodities.
607 2018-06-24 14:56:32 A mi alguien me dijo: "you should be ashamed of leaving your family in PR and living here with all these commodities." Me encabrono tanto, la gente habla sin saber 
608 2018-06-24 14:33:36 However,  my brother you have that rarerest of commodities. 

A brain    
more importantly, your thoughts control it.
609 2018-06-24 14:32:53 Watching the futures market says a lot. When the EU is no longer trading commodities and Canada, Mexico, China, Japan, and so many more companies it really is a clown show, a circus..Nationalism has never worked for any country..ever.
610 2018-06-24 14:32:49 Probably not. It took 47 wins to make the playoffs out west this year and counting on 2 unknown commodities to carry you there seems like a bad plan.
611 2018-06-24 14:17:34 Your Tweet makes no sense. Every American with a motor vehicle knows gas prices. Obama & his Energy Secretary wanted higher gas prices, but the commodities free markets did otherwise
612 2018-06-24 14:16:28 Post GFC its about the rate of change of Fed assets & “liabilities” that matters more. The Fed started tightening in Summer 2014 way before its first IOER hike in 2015. Result crushed commodities. Now a repeat in outright tapering within the context of heavy Treasury issuance.
613 2018-06-24 14:16:04 Don’t feel bad. Your time and money are precious commodities
614 2018-06-24 14:15:33 Fed Ex recognizes the inherent worth of each commodity shipped and has a plan for returns. Immigrant children are NOT packages or commodities but their worth as human beings is inalienable. They deserve a plan for parental return. Period.
615 2018-06-24 14:11:18 I'm prepared to pay more for my commodities. I'll support a living wage for workers. Will you?
616 2018-06-24 13:55:59 vendemos commodities, né...

617 2018-06-24 13:45:27 World economy

Changes brought about by developed countries have indirectly helped many countries to profit. For example, countries that produce unique commodities have benefitted from the price gains.
618 2018-06-24 13:45:15 Commodity market

India is a prominent exporter of agricultural commodities and a key importer of metal commodities. Metal commodities gain value when they become finished products, thus resulting in inflation
619 2018-06-24 13:45:10 fenómeno, y que hacemos?? Esperamos a que alguien nos regale 3-4 puntos de crecimiento o a otro boom de commodities?
620 2018-06-24 13:35:22 OMG, this has been the plan the whole time. To profit off of their heinous actions. People are commodities to be sold. It's going to look highly suspicious when brown babies fill the adoption centers.
621 2018-06-24 13:30:24 This is a commendable initiative as @NCDCgov  and the state PHEOCs will have commodities to deploy to the field immediately an outbreak occurs greatly reducing response time .@BayelsaPHEOC
622 2018-06-24 13:18:28 Slavd owners named their slaves. Then proceeded to treat them like commodities.
623 2018-06-24 13:09:16 I hope you are  not inspired by corruption.  I hope you don't/won't import the commodities your industries produce and in the process kill your industries at the expense of a few OLIGARCHY. Good luck .
624 2018-06-24 13:06:12 @markessien  instead of investing time and money on Crypto, why not invest in the knowledge of Forex, stocks and commodities trading.
625 2018-06-24 13:01:23 Wats so funny about it... Maybe u have no idea about crude... 80 is easy to come from where it is now based on the planetary positions... Infact with saturn in sggitarius by 2019 end or so even 140 is possible... Anything is possible in commodities
626 2018-06-24 12:49:42 Anyone ever tried to make a million and then it all goes wrong!! Well in that situation now. Basically my father past away earlier this year and wanted to give my mum support so invested all my money into commodities and in a state where I need more money to make a million.
627 2018-06-24 12:48:42 Commodities and lots more, except import goods
628 2018-06-24 12:31:22 His eulogy to Castro proved he equates Totalitarian Dictatorship with Democratic systems and that he regards Human Rights as mere commodities to be dispensed with as he sees fit
629 2018-06-24 12:27:58 OPEC and commodities market impact prices they run in cycles.  I have a blister on my hand must be Trump’s fault.
630 2018-06-24 12:20:01 I just can't have dog racing. The unwanted and "unsuccessful" greyhounds are often treated with horrendous cruelty. Commodities to be discarded.
631 2018-06-24 12:11:19 Seems like overall economy is slowing which would mean less consumption of commodities.   Why in this environment would commodity price appreciation be so large? Outside of something like grains where supply is rolling over and demand is up.
632 2018-06-24 12:09:27 I’m certain any benevolent God would be turning away from humans who treat other beings like commodities to be used and exploited.
633 2018-06-24 12:02:49 Answer: In general, it will track the mining cycle depending on the demand/supply curve.  As for junior mining stocks, potential Tier 1 projects with the right prerequisites at inception tend to do best. From the Brent Cook playbook? Also, the right hot commodities with EV cycle.
634 2018-06-24 11:56:14 If we make more infrastructure in North America, that will good for South America too, because it need the commodities.
635 2018-06-24 11:52:22 I do for commodities traded in a primitive market. Not for today's sophisticated markets. But there is nothing sophisticated about crypto markets, so EW applies.
636 2018-06-24 11:46:32 Fed Ex recognizes the inherent worth of each commodity shipped and has a plan for returns. Immigrant children are NOT packages or commodities but their worth as human beings is inalienable. They deserve a plan for parental return. Period.
637 2018-06-24 11:42:53 Innocent children, traded like commodities, used as bargaining chips and political footballs by a government?

We've used less as motivation to bomb and invade other countries.
638 2018-06-24 11:42:27 Tell @business they report on the prices like stocks bonds commodities
639 2018-06-24 11:42:10 Terrible terrible audio recording purportedly of Editor and Owner of #Khabrain on the web. Shocking what these people are up to. On the one hand they talk of morality and regressive cultural values and on the other hand they exploit women like this. Women are not commodities.
640 2018-06-24 11:39:42 That's about their stocks and commodities trading :)
641 2018-06-24 11:31:57 Quote by @davidgraeber: “It is the pathology of capitalism that the reproduction of humanity is seen as an adjunct to the production of commodities rather than the other way round. The educational system is thought as good for the economy rather than economy good for education.”
642 2018-06-24 11:21:49 Government should set up a NATIONAL COMMODITY AUTHORITY to manage all imports of commodities, thereafter appoint PWC, or any  TOP  AUDIT firm of repute to manage, Miller’s can go and buy from the authority when in need. CARTELS will DIE and farming will become VIABLE.

647 2018-06-24 11:09:38 Amid trade threats from the White House, China's central bank freed up $110B in a reduction in required bank lending reserves. #PBOC hinted as much on Wednesday, acted today, in an effort to boost credit supply to smaller companies.

648 2018-06-24 11:07:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
649 2018-06-24 11:04:07 Jos Buttler showing one of his forgotten commodities recently; that he's a terrific keeper. Quick, athletic behind the stumps, very aware and sharp. One of the best fielding players England have ever produced. Still a better keeper than Bairstow imo. #ENGvAUS

653 2018-06-24 10:40:24 120 million people are victims of high value!!
Prices of some essential commodities, including rice, have risen in 2017. Despite the increase in the per capita income in the country last year, it has not received any benefit of 12 million people of low and middle income!
654 2018-06-24 10:37:11 Historically, there has been a bull market in the commodities every 20 or 30 years.

657 2018-06-24 10:25:35 So now I’ve read the reviews of Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom, I’m convinced I saw a different film. It wasn’t perfect. But it was certainly a lot more interesting than the last one. The Dinos aren’t awe inspiring anymore, they’re common/commodities. Just like the franchise tbh.
658 2018-06-24 10:06:19 Commodities are the opium of the people.
659 2018-06-24 09:36:18 Good Move to ban plastic in Maharashtra.rather it should be banned completely but wondering why Milk Packets still not banned & moreover retailers rapping the commodities in newpapers temp packs. no body taking a notice that print ink can hv impact on packed in these papers packs
660 2018-06-24 09:35:36 Can you explain the cause of price hike of daily commodities, meat and dairy products,
661 2018-06-24 09:26:53 I fully disagree there. Over the last 10 years it has become far harder to move non-legitimate money through the traditional banking system. And doing it via commodities is very complicated (just read all the stories on gold smuggling).
662 2018-06-24 09:25:02 Will there, now? Tax evasion and money laundering is as easily done with national currencies, or commodities. A crypto with too few buyers is a crypto with no bottom.
663 2018-06-24 09:09:03 An estimated 8.27 terawatt-hours per year. That might sound like a lot, but it’s actually less than an eighth of what U.S. data centers use, 1 and only about 0.21 percent of total U.S. consumption. 
It also compares favorably to the commodities that btc could help replace:

666 2018-06-24 08:40:41 Commodities are doing well despite strong dollar , precious metals and EM are struggling . Europe and China economies losing momentum ,USA econımy gaining momentum on the contrary , can we expect more dollar strength ahead ?
667 2018-06-24 08:15:58 The coin game has always been risky because it's basically FX trading a future-oriented global currency family against nation state fiat and commodities.

How could that not be volatile?

The underlying tech trend towards "software is eating the world" is inevitable @mattereum.
668 2018-06-24 08:01:04 Children are not commodities to be purchased because you "want" a child to play family.  A child is a gift from God.  A child should be a result of the love shared between his father and mother in the marital act.  God shares His awesome power to create new life with couples.

673 2018-06-24 07:18:38 this guy is soooo stupid... i mean, without corporations producing commodities at scale by compensating people for their labour, everyone knows that everyone is too selfish and self-interested to do stuff that may produce the materials needed for communities to thrive
674 2018-06-24 07:16:22 Sir U r Discussing What happened almost 3-4 decades back, Why Don’t u Discuss what is happening in our Country Currently. Prices of important commodities have risen up, Rupee falling constantly, growing incidences of Mob Lynching etc etc...!!
675 2018-06-24 07:04:44 Prices of essential commodities have come drastically down. Gone are the days when our inflation was towering in double digits. We were in fragile Five. Cost of essential medicines have sky dived . UPA was busy proving “Hindu Terror” . They didn’t care about common people .
676 2018-06-24 06:59:28 CS industrialization to be arrested and charged together with KRA and KEBS top brass. It's ironical to see him giving press breifings  yet he knows the barons behind the sugar, fertilise and other worse commodities  flowing in the market!  Let him take responsibility!
677 2018-06-24 06:42:04 “But if young women are treating their bodies and sexuality as commodities, it’s not because of porn culture—it’s because of a larger societal message that tells them their sexuality is not their own.”

We simply need better welfare for everyone. Affordable commodities, less taxes, better health care, safer environment, etc. dont single out!
681 2018-06-24 05:20:08 People who experience this kind of abuse are being merchandised. Turned into commodities. Bought and sold exactly like barrels of oil or cattle.
682 2018-06-24 05:16:09 The banker who trades in commodities is a murderer.
683 2018-06-24 04:40:32 State bottle deposit systems work where they exist. 2/3 of recyclable bottles end up in landfills.

688 2018-06-24 03:53:13 Softs are a prime example that just because prices continue to fall, it doesn't mean it's a good time to go long.

Combination of bumpers, technology etc will continue to push prices lower.

689 2018-06-24 03:22:30 Trump placed tariffs on Canada, Mexico, China, EU, and UK commodities. By your logic, Trudeau is the leader of all these nations.

691 2018-06-24 03:00:43 O CAFÉ e o PETRÓLEO são commodities internacionais, cotadas em dólares.

692 2018-06-24 02:54:43 one more nice thing: we are one of the largest commodities producers in the world, but since they are traded at American stock exchanges we cannot trade it there because investing in other country is the highest tax possible ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

694 2018-06-24 02:35:52 Qdo vier a recessão americana (em 2 ou 3 anos?), normalmente temos mais 2 ou 3 anos de delay.

PIB americano em 2010 foi de 2%, e do Brasil foi de 7.5%. Commodities já tinham ficado pra trás. Eram os efeitos inerciais das commodities empulsionando os setores mais tardios.
695 2018-06-24 02:34:35 Talvez tenhamos uma puxada boa de commodities num prazo de 5 anos...mas não "aquela bolha 2004-2010"....os outros pontos me parecem variáveis que podem se interrelacionar de maneira nao tão otimista assim...a selic estrutural de que falou pode ir abaixo se EUA subirem forte juros
696 2018-06-24 02:30:21 Teremos a previdência (imposição matemática). Temos imposição de teto de gastos, e temos inflação freada pela TLP. A TLP e ref trabalhista impactam estruturalmente a selic, q vai ajudar nos lucros das cias. Boom de commodities eu não descarto, pelo contrário.

707 2018-06-24 01:14:14 Igual pareciera que eso es solo una foto, no la película, teniendo en cuenta la proyección de demanda mundial de soja para 2025, China este año vá a importar 100 mill tn de soja, vs 200 mlln en 2025, yo creo que de aquí a 2025 se viene otro superciclo de commodities agricolas .
708 2018-06-24 01:07:46 Not a very encouraging article as our economy is so closely linked to real estate trends. Home buyers purchase furniture and other household items. These commodities will also suffer. Let’s hope that everything turns around soon. In the meantime let’s stay positive and be ready.
709 2018-06-24 00:55:27 Thank you! I’m basically a Trader Dante clone right now—extremely tuned to Forex and commodities. I have other things I’m researching to see if alterations should be made for crypto, but I’ll only present them here if I’m able to gather enough data showing they add value.
710 2018-06-24 00:46:36 A truly pro sex viewpoint is one that affirms the goodness of fertility and the nature of sex. From there is recognizes that responsible sex demands much more from us than contraception. It requires us to contemplate that children aren't commodities
711 2018-06-24 00:42:42 So if you make car parts the opinions of car manufacturers or car part retailers are irrelevant? Commodities are exchanged. They have to be for you to get anything out of them other than themselves.
712 2018-06-24 00:41:29 How is what a labourer wants or needs irrelevant? He works for a reason. He works for money, which he needs to exchange for other commodities that aren't available without that exchange commodity.
713 2018-06-24 00:38:07 Pienso que el presidente electo debiera hacer: 1) Agregarle valor a nuestras exportaciones de commodities, 2) Formalizar la economía premiando a los empresarios con bajas permanentes de impuestos.3) Fomento al emprendimiento y al empoderamiento de las niñas.
714 2018-06-24 00:29:03 True, but it would cause an internal liquidity crisis in China which would lead to them having trouble buying commodities in the open market.
715 2018-06-24 00:21:02 Rich people love discussing the price of commodities
716 2018-06-24 00:19:11 Reminds me of Liverpool, girls selling sex for £4 a pop and men still ripping them off and taking their money or paying 25£ for an entire stag party to well. . . Disgusting. Where are people, why do we look away? Women are still mere commodities to be traded. 
717 2018-06-24 00:18:27 Just read article abt couple in Missouri who adopted immigrant mother’s child. judge said they can keep him. They did this while she awaited trial on illegal entry. This is the plan is for many of these children. They are “reassigning” children to new families, like commodities.
