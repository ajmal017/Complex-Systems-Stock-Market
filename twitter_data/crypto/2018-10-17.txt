40 2018-10-17 23:57:25 They think you're a spam bot.  You'll have to either follow those instructions or just forget about that account.  They'll never respond to your query.  I know, the same thing happened to me.
41 2018-10-17 23:56:55 I also don’t think this is a winner take all industry for SC platforms. The different trade offs interms of scalability vs decentralization could have many points of value accrual and have made bets that that is the case
42 2018-10-17 23:56:29 Because legalisation legitamises taxation in the warped mind of a statist.
43 2018-10-17 23:56:28 そういや昨日渋谷でフクロウさんに激似の人とすれ違った。声掛けようかと思ったけど人違いかもしれないし、そもそも知らない人にフクロウさんと喋ってる所見られるのちょっと恥ずかしいな…って思ってやめておいた
44 2018-10-17 23:56:02 @C3_Nik I follow you avidly and respect perspect away from unwarranted speculation and was wondering would you divulge other crypto assets within your persepectince?
45 2018-10-17 23:55:35 IF is healthy AF
46 2018-10-17 23:55:33 Zoom out even further beyond liquid network. Crypto in general is largely crony capitalism
47 2018-10-17 23:55:25 Starting to get some new followers again. Could be a sign of changing crypto market
48 2018-10-17 23:55:22 I’m definitely not bearish on Ethereum again due to the amount of projects built on top of it. Those mainly being in the DeFi industry continue to impress me and I think Eth will benefit from them.
49 2018-10-17 23:55:15 What the hell are you talking about? People tend to follow paths of those who inspire and lead.  This is also work to ensure an inclusive workforce and provide exposure to fields not typically held by women.  For those ladies and @cloudera leading the charge, charge on!
50 2018-10-17 23:55:07 Hardly the biggest partnership in crypto. Vechain has some of the biggest partnerships. Carbon points with the world's largest electric car manufacturer & vaccine program for Shanghai province being two.
I really believe anyone investing in XVG or TRX will be sorely disappointed.

52 2018-10-17 23:54:39 Falcons should name @kenneth__ head coach and VP of crypto sales. Their success would go through the roof, and he would never blow a 28-3 lead in the super bowl!

54 2018-10-17 23:54:22 Wtf. Why is twitter so sensitive these days?  People need to grow a pair and stop getting offended.
55 2018-10-17 23:54:17 Why’s there more volatility in the stock market than the crypto market? Interesting few months ahead of us...

64 2018-10-17 23:52:13 Well u got at least one suspension that I remember of. Thing is it was temporary. I really don't know how u didn't get banned permanently yet tho. 
65 2018-10-17 23:52:12 If it was me, I’d want to bet on the team that I wanted to win but I also don’t gamble. Rather invest in crypto and stocks 
66 2018-10-17 23:52:09 What can i do to have all this calls early from you?🖒
67 2018-10-17 23:51:58  bye bye hater...
68 2018-10-17 23:50:54 Because nothing is for certain and FUD will wreak havoc on a novice investors mind. Sure 5k is cool, what if it goes to 4K? Or 3k? Or 1.5k? Many who SAY they would hold will find its not so easy when price just keeps dropping. This is how retail gets shaken out.
69 2018-10-17 23:50:49 I had that, it took me about 3 weeks to get it back. Twitter support didn’t answer at all, it just got sorted on its own for me.

110 2018-10-17 23:44:07 Bitcoin is trying to force everything over on Lightening which not even work. It's a real shit show with the Bitcoin Core developers. Ethereum has wonderful leadership but they need to move faster with on-chain scaling - Casper & sharding. I heard plasma is already in games now.
111 2018-10-17 23:44:04 Right now this is the most important project on ETH - Funny enough it’s the least mentioned and hyped. Not sure if you guys used/tested linkpool but the interface is slick and easy to use. It’s my largest alt holding and has been for a very long time.

127 2018-10-17 23:42:24 Ah OK, I misunderstood you, apologies. Yes, the crypto factions have splintered quite bitterly in places. The old days were different but as it becomes gradually more mainstream this is inevitable given the divisions in society too?
128 2018-10-17 23:42:23 why? 
129 2018-10-17 23:42:13 This is fucked up man!! :///
130 2018-10-17 23:42:12 I feel like ETH will def make the upgrades but when is the question. They messed up by not bringing out Hybrid Casper FFG this fall like what was planned. That would have at least maintained a healthier price in this bear.
131 2018-10-17 23:42:10 Lol another one?
132 2018-10-17 23:42:09 Are you bullish on XRP? 
133 2018-10-17 23:41:39 Excellent Project.
134 2018-10-17 23:41:30 Nothings confirmed. He said partner. He’s not going to mess that up
135 2018-10-17 23:41:25 His new account is @TheCryptoMonk4 plsss follow him, old account got banned!
136 2018-10-17 23:41:15 No Doubt, it Show,s.
137 2018-10-17 23:41:04 I hope you realize you will have lost ALL credibility in the blockchain space and will be the laughing stock of crypto if your strategic partnership with Google is nothing more than commercial arrangement to host a node on their cloud servers.

144 2018-10-17 23:40:30 Imagine watching that tiny green candle pop up on the charts because of all that fiat going into crypto. 
145 2018-10-17 23:40:21 email airdrops are a CIA psyop to link crypto addresses to real people. Always use a one time account when signing up. @_tm3k
146 2018-10-17 23:40:20 Yes both ETH & Bitcoin are in serious danger of better tech disrupting them. It's a top concern of mine for a while now. They both have the network effects working for them but it will not last much longer as incumbents pile in w/ much better scale & better user experience.

152 2018-10-17 23:39:24 It’s most disappointing that sex workers have such an obvious use case when it comes to crypto but get shamed for participating in the culture by the people chosen to foster “diversity and inclusion”.
153 2018-10-17 23:39:16 I'm going to agree with the other two commenters in this thread. Crypto is not going to help when a state wants to stop foreign aid.

170 2018-10-17 23:37:06 I continue to be impressed with everything being built on top of $Eth. However, scaling continues to be 3-5 years away. With all other smart contract platforms coming out within the next 6-12 months, I don’t know if 1m is going to be enough to hold their advantage

182 2018-10-17 23:34:50 Yes and that was at nearly 800bln dollar market. Now 4x that, you're looking Ata 3.2 trillion dollar market to meet those levels. So my 2 trillion dollar market cap was actually very generous if we're going by those standards.

197 2018-10-17 23:32:09 Funny how the private VC token market is 'hot', while the public Crypto markets are 'dirt cheap'. Investors should be buying the public markets now while cheap but they are doing opposite. All startups are risky AF - public or private. It feels safer private but not the case.

210 2018-10-17 23:29:51 You're right, I was skeptical too. Everything to do with crypto should be triple-checked for imposters. He said it's a new channel and currently trying to acquire his name without the suspicious trailing underscore.
211 2018-10-17 23:29:51 For payments in crypto to become massive you need lower volatility. And what about anonymity? If there are several people in the line for a coffee in a café, how does the café owner know who of them has already made their crypto transfer to his/her café wallet?
212 2018-10-17 23:29:47 you are a brother to me @Bleeding_Crypto I appreciate you and everyone else here. So many people ive never met in person that I can trust more than some people ive known my whole life. #Cryptotwitter is a beautiful place honestly. Thank you so much to you and everyone 
213 2018-10-17 23:29:17 Teelaunch. Lots of great print on demand services. I've been connecting with a local person for a few months now so it could be best to find somebody you trust locally. Otherwise Print on Demand is a great route.

234 2018-10-17 23:26:13 He's doing the business he can based on the market. He can't change the market alone so why would he overpay tho. It has to come from their country first to give them a better edge to be able to not accept such low rates imho

246 2018-10-17 23:22:58 Food Babies are wonderful
247 2018-10-17 23:22:50 Absolutely. Crypto’s whole premise is based off privacy. When the market turns people will be interested in privacy again. If this country continues down this path then we will certainly see privacy coins become even more valuable.
248 2018-10-17 23:22:30 PLEASE BE MORE APPROPRIATE WITH YOUR TIMING! Targets tho?

258 2018-10-17 23:21:03 Uh oh...


259 2018-10-17 23:20:52 It's genuinely so fucking frustrating. No warning. No reasons given. Loads of accounts suspended. Silence upon contacting support. It feels so inexplicably pointed at crypto and it's baffling
260 2018-10-17 23:20:42 holding select alts, spot bitcoin . hedging short eth and xbt swaps on bitmex.  now we wait
261 2018-10-17 23:20:38 Bitconnect style tokens that prove to be total scams. Ones that have teams that slowly fade out when they realize that they really don't want to put the work into a project, etc. Other than that, if a company is making some attempt to be legit, junk or not, they'll survive.
262 2018-10-17 23:20:32 Are we trying to make this crypto conference in L.A.? Sounds kinda familiar.

Was it my challenge to see if I could accomplish exposure myself? Or stay in the position I'm in as long as I can while selling them on blockchain?
263 2018-10-17 23:20:16 FYI: #stablecoins are a copycat of #wallstreet’s ‘money market fund,’ but ‘crazily’ highly risky. And, it’s a piece of  if u truly understand what they do with your fiat! That $GUSD too!

271 2018-10-17 23:19:03 Yea, with the retweets etc its looking real. I'll say this much, in the crypto space with all the scammers and impersonators, this announcement did not initially do much if anything to distinguish itself from a fake.
272 2018-10-17 23:18:57 not me
273 2018-10-17 23:18:49 Yes unfortunately stupid tends to be the standard. That'll change.

278 2018-10-17 23:17:19 There's an issue which isn't discussed nearly enough, the many who would happily throw gamblers under the bus to help appease institutions and encourage heavy-handed regulators.
Sadly there's hardly anyone to stand up for us, even though we've been integral to the rise of crypto.
279 2018-10-17 23:17:18 Your head is truly warped if you think that.
280 2018-10-17 23:17:12 And Russia and China continue to drop us treasury holdings ... short term this is going to hurt, long term hopefully it evens out trade. But if you're not invested in crypto or metals, it'll get really nasty
281 2018-10-17 23:17:09 Really helps in looking at the big picture. Thanks @AstroCrytpoGuru 
I'll def be donating sometime soon! :)
282 2018-10-17 23:17:03 Just how everything today seems like it would have been satire ten years ago. I had an unreal feeling.
283 2018-10-17 23:16:58 Take a step back man, you don't need to be constantly stressed about the trading aspect of it
284 2018-10-17 23:16:21 Tokenized People so far (outside the #Tokenaire Organization): @joelcomm (Co-Host Bad Crypto Podcast) @crypto_rand (Crypto Trader and Adviser) @teedubya (Co-Host Bad Crypto Podcast) @ZeusZissou (Crypto Trader and Adviser)  Watch why the LOVE & SUPPORT us
285 2018-10-17 23:16:20 Maybe you got reported by some mad economists. Let's see if it happens to other large crypto Twitter accounts
286 2018-10-17 23:15:49 Should have been mining crypto in JavaScript instead. 
287 2018-10-17 23:15:45 But they already publicly stated there not. But plan to add more assets in the future
288 2018-10-17 23:15:43 Its not a loss until you sell!
289 2018-10-17 23:15:28 Every Mialords are crypto Victorian stooges
290 2018-10-17 23:15:22 You have a great excuse as to why you don’t follow certain accounts now. You didn’t even have to hurt feelings by unfollowing.
291 2018-10-17 23:15:21 We need to find a way to bridge the gap between #crypto and traditional investors. #SecurityTokens will be DOA if only crypto traders with a crypto risk profile get involved

293 2018-10-17 23:15:13 Crypto is the worst thing that I ever encountered. I'm fucking tired of my brain always deep thinking about it. I fully believe it will suck more people down the rabbit hole & rek a few degen gamblers for the better.

310 2018-10-17 23:13:07 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, let’s put an end to Chinas dominance over crypto with Bitcoin and get behind @Ripple. Endless regulations are holding us back. Please tell the SEC to get to work and give us the guidance we need.
311 2018-10-17 23:13:07 Revolut only has CFD exposure to crypto (similar to Robinhood/eToro etc.).
312 2018-10-17 23:13:05 Are there any that you feel won’t survive?
313 2018-10-17 23:13:04 I agree 100%. I feel very bad for those who joined December/January that has only experienced pain and losses. I believe those who persevere till the end will have the last laugh

326 2018-10-17 23:11:46 If you created a token on Togen, make sure to share it in this thread. I am interested in seeing what you come up with.

334 2018-10-17 23:10:26 If you value tokens at what it costs to mine them and then value equities at the price you could liquidate companies for... crypto would be way closer to being fairly valued and equities absurdly overvalued in many cases. One point to make here.
335 2018-10-17 23:09:58 If that's crypto than they are both fake

Trolling till they consider quitting, banned, suspended, etc. If mainstream money and  market manipulators want total control over the crypto sphere then they need to get rid of the underground, the dissenting voice.

430 2018-10-17 22:56:08 And there it is, how can any crypto be deemed not a security when it is so complicated, nothing has been said official about any coin, Coinbase uses the confusion to list coins they are heavily invested in and to make it seem like it must not be a security because they listed it

434 2018-10-17 22:55:28 Agree bout equities but when you're buying crypto what accomplishments can any crypto (even BTC) boast today? Crypto hardly accepted anywhere yet, and even retailers who do accept report that it makes up a very small % of total revenue
435 2018-10-17 22:55:27 unpopular opinion part 2: if u look at market cap of top 10 coins and see what they have achieved to justify current valuation vs companies with real earnings, I'm not sure which asset class is more overvalued.
436 2018-10-17 22:55:19 and that red/green line going through the bars, what is that? thanks

459 2018-10-17 22:52:34 Guessing you’re talking about crypto and I would argue that 100% of the value isn’t derived from future expectations.

Plus...look at equities right now. The only thing holding up those valuations is A LOT of hope and dreams of the future.
460 2018-10-17 22:52:20 Mate, you do understand that by name calling others you've already lost the debate, no matter what valid remarks you might have?

Thank you.
469 2018-10-17 22:51:20 If you look at all crypto besides the odd one nothing is really doing anything major so its just a waiting game the real question is how long can you hold before you can't take it anymore and jump ship ?

491 2018-10-17 22:48:20 Crypto/Web3 is really slow right now
492 2018-10-17 22:48:13 Heard that some well known exchanges don't list new ICO coins at the moment due to bad market conditions and not to get associated with being a dumping ground. Any thoughts or insights?
493 2018-10-17 22:48:05 This tweet was related to stocks :)

However, I treat stocks the same as crypto. 1% in stocks is also 1% in crypto. So why treat them differently.

507 2018-10-17 22:45:44 been in crypto for years. never has a day or 3 been a problem. not once. 

best practices vs being lame. not hard for exchanges to be decent. most are.
508 2018-10-17 22:45:44 I didn't say that. I was merely talking about old origins.
509 2018-10-17 22:45:36 Where do you see $neo in 2019
510 2018-10-17 22:45:24 What is your take on the “Chinese New Year” money moving out of crypto 2019.  Was it mostly this year an excuse that we use to blame for our rekt funds?
511 2018-10-17 22:45:23 is Airswap actively thinking about tokenomics and how to create value for the $AST token in the future? Adding features like rewards/loyalty points or staking/voting? Being an exchange, it makes sense to follow Binance as an example, always creating more benefits for BNB holders.
512 2018-10-17 22:45:18 Maybe Google the  definition of "job" and "wage" next and see if the dictionary can help you there.
513 2018-10-17 22:45:13 What happened to monk? These bans are getting out of hand
514 2018-10-17 22:45:12 It’s a step in the right direction, but for crypto to take off, we need joe soap to be able to invest in crypto easily, the technology needs to be recalibrated for the mass market, not only hedge funds.
515 2018-10-17 22:45:11 I honestly think #musk wouldn’t even WANT to be in the crypto space because he does the extraordinary. There are far too many people involved in this space for it to be of interest to him, he is focused on making the world more mobile, in a sense he is attempting to invent
516 2018-10-17 22:45:10 Yes, most ppl live in poverty. That's why there's a thing called the 1%.

525 2018-10-17 22:44:08 Yeah but sidechains was supposed to be how to make it work better without competing/replacing a multi-billion dollar alternative financial system. If the “something better” attitude is accepted, then no crypto money could hold meaningful value.

561 2018-10-17 22:38:33 People be like “have you heard of blockchain?” 
Me: nope

And after that episode of Greenleaf... “did you know you could get rich in crypto currency?”

Me: Well ya don’t say?!?
562 2018-10-17 22:38:23 I have a grey pussy now.
563 2018-10-17 22:38:23 I’m seeing this post everywhere.. You sure they didn’t just send the 0.83 it says as the estimated transaction amount??

If that is the case crypto peeps are spreading false info without checking (shocker)
564 2018-10-17 22:38:12 Note to self - don't refer to Mystery novel as Kill Dash Nine. Use Kill -9 or KD9. Apparently, Dash is a crypto thingy.
565 2018-10-17 22:38:06 A big part of crypto is personal responsibility.  Take care of your investment and stop whining.
566 2018-10-17 22:38:05 You're seriously missing some basic logic here. Good luck.

578 2018-10-17 22:37:10 I'd call being free when you have a choice of not working for shitty jobs and u have enough money to take good care of your health and ur family. Being able to buy a house, put food in the table, take a time out whenever you want, etc.

Some ppl have no choices and no time outs.

587 2018-10-17 22:36:01 Lmao.
588 2018-10-17 22:35:41 Quite a stretch from that to slavery. Slaves don't even have the option to quit and starve to death.

590 2018-10-17 22:35:26 ETC sucks at promoting & literally had all rights to claim ETC is the real Ethereum & promote a flippening since ETC didn’t roll back the DAO like ETH cause ETH was themselves the ones who fucked up & rather than pay back losses from ETH own funds dey just roll it back like cucks

596 2018-10-17 22:34:19 Nice one, the liquor solution with D.I.G. is right now the best example of how physical goods will be traded on the chain. At the end, everything will be connected.
597 2018-10-17 22:34:12 Subscribed! So much crypto content these days, I don't watch tv anymore, other than sometimes falling asleep to re-runs of Shark Tank.
598 2018-10-17 22:34:03 That said, TSP is so important. Can you imagine waiting around at a store for the blockchain confirmation after you pick up your groceries. (If that’s how we believe/hope crypto will one day be used.)

Also, companies need speed. Not really 1M, but def faster than BTC&ETH today.

600 2018-10-17 22:33:37 Where do you think VeChain stands against the rest of the platform plays? They seem to have large eye opening partnerships, a successful mainnet launch, and working market products already. But it doesn’t get the run of a EOS or others in the community.

603 2018-10-17 22:33:13 Ce qu'il nous faut en France c'est vite, très vite une règlementation au niveau bancaire notamment sur les questions de compliance. Aujourd'hui le mot crypto est encore malheureusement trop souvent (pour ne pas dire systématiquement) considéré comme un "gros-mot" par les banques.
604 2018-10-17 22:33:12 You made the claim, the burden of proof is on you....
605 2018-10-17 22:33:03 I agree. The crypto market has changed. I believe the market is being supressed. When everything is in place and the time is right, the bull market will be historical.
606 2018-10-17 22:32:58 I've listened to meditations about 10 times. The intro is amazing by itself, along with the rest of it.

613 2018-10-17 22:32:22 Here are some points I think should be addressed when it comes accumulating alts. Remember, the wrong asset can be accumulated, There is no "If/Then" relationship that states it must go up after. $btc $eth $crypto

615 2018-10-17 22:31:26 Ohhhh shit it's M. u. S. C. L. E.
616 2018-10-17 22:31:22 That's exactly why I think coins like XVG or OCN will survive. They still pump in a bear market when others pump even through their flaws. So much of crypto is speculative gambling so when the market pumps be ready for all coins to pump to new ATH's
617 2018-10-17 22:31:18 suspended reason?
618 2018-10-17 22:31:06 But you have proven that audits on stablecoins are difficult -- I honestly think 3rd party attestations are fine for what we are doing in crypto
619 2018-10-17 22:30:59 I would say a bigger issue is the lack of Bitcoin or Crypto related payment methods by the bigger players in the market like Amazon. The second biggest problem is the fact that most wallets and technology wrapping isn’t focused at the mass market, key management remains a problem

634 2018-10-17 22:27:41 I'm only familiar with Mailvelope, I've never heard any particularly bad things about it.

I consider such tools at least "in theory" to be more secure than browser-based crypto that does not require an extension.

All software has bugs of course, and a browser is a big target.

652 2018-10-17 22:24:02 No, there isn't. You either are free or you aren't. It's a yes or no thing.

If you are "almost" free, you still aren't. There are obviously worst cases that really put all the meaning to the origins of slavery like you say, but it doesn't mean this isn't modern slavery.

Is the the jobs that are slavery? or do economic and societal conditions create a class of people dependent on unskilled labor?

Just wait until the robots are upgraded.

693 2018-10-17 22:19:01 I never said I had an actual solution, I was stating simple facts. It's slavery simply based that many people cannot afford to not work for minimum wage jobs and they'll barely put food in the table, period.
694 2018-10-17 22:18:44 Nice... And no crypto taxes from what I understand?

696 2018-10-17 22:18:08 How can we tell the real crypto projects from the fake ones if the developers are too busy working to let the people know what’s going on with their work.

702 2018-10-17 22:17:15 You don't have an actual solution, you just made up some nonsensical bumper sticker slogan "min wage is slavery" and act like it was profound, when really its as worthless a statement as anyone has made on the matter.
703 2018-10-17 22:17:13 So glad I made 4 gmn's only had too kill one last Jan too greed. But mining since hour 4 of main network launch with mid size GPU farm has been epic.
704 2018-10-17 22:17:12 The numbers made sense why they chose this coin I’m pretty sure everything else will follow suit

706 2018-10-17 22:16:46 @crypt0cranium only expresses political views about #crypto, financial regulation and surveillance, and surrounding economics.
707 2018-10-17 22:16:13 What happen ? Sucks
708 2018-10-17 22:16:01 That is why I am all for XRP. You should look into it too. Crypto is not all Bitcoin.
709 2018-10-17 22:16:01 my ideal crypto would replace traditional currency. id want it to be able to be used, not just stockpiled like stocks. imagine trying to buy a pizza with shares of a company, and then the processing fee is worth more than 4 pizzas even if they accept it.

712 2018-10-17 22:15:43 If they apply for IPO so it’s early bankrupt
713 2018-10-17 22:15:32 Facts:

1 - A ton of people can't afford not to work on a minimum wage
2 - Minimum wage will barely pay for your food

If that's freedom to you, then alright.
714 2018-10-17 22:15:30 again, this hyperbolic bullshit contributes to the real problems we face in this world. Calling minimum wage 'slavery' is similar to calling every white person a "nazi". Its simply bullshit meant to create an emotional response. If you have real arguments, present them.
715 2018-10-17 22:15:06 A crypto currency's most valuable measure is it's  network value. And none beat king $BTC. Even if you don't trade just keep strategically acquiring BTC you will live a good life
716 2018-10-17 22:15:04 thank you 
717 2018-10-17 22:15:04 I get that lots of #crypto #developers are busy working on their games and projects, but with so many planning to release and failing, we need more active members of their dev team letting us know what’s up with the progress of their projects #blockchain
718 2018-10-17 22:15:00 Truth! If someone has your back at the bottom. You better fucken have their back at the top.

Anything else you’d like to discuss?
727 2018-10-17 22:13:44 #Crypto #Twitter is not a source for retail buyers to find out crypto info, this is also where professional #financial #advisors read.

728 2018-10-17 22:13:43 Needless infighting has been bad for crypto.  No need to rant, just go fork yourself.

735 2018-10-17 22:12:54 Actually minimum wage was born as a way to segregate people and make impossible to have a job if you produce less than the minimum wage
736 2018-10-17 22:12:51 Well...I bought $XVG at 1-2s.  Found it on bitcointalk.  Not twitter.  There are others...

You’re right though.   You can find $crypto gems on twitter.  $MORE is a good example.  Way under #ico, lowest cap on #bittrex, active development, proven use case, 10 clubs planned, 2 now

738 2018-10-17 22:12:27 Right? lmao
739 2018-10-17 22:12:26 You are right. Time is a good thing.  The price will remain low(er) and XRP and the nodes will continue to become more decentralized.  Faster Payments are required in parts of Europe in 2019, US and most of Europe by 2020.   Decisions and clarification are coming.
740 2018-10-17 22:12:14 Some people are simply too blind to see the hidden chains.

792 2018-10-17 22:06:09 So it's a job (hey, a first job even!), not slavery. Exactly my point.

810 2018-10-17 22:04:23 I personally feel the hold-back on the mass adoption dilemma in our community hinges on people being willing to let go of that barbarous relic ( The dollar ) but I am more than happy to be the advance party for max use of crypto as an individual until we all get there.

PS. Nobody forces anyone to get into debt. And nobody forces you to work a min wage job.
819 2018-10-17 22:02:22 Yes, to an extent obviously. Slaves were fed. With $300 usd per month you can barely afford decent food. So you get the illusion of being free in a minimum wage job. You aren't.

826 2018-10-17 22:01:45 But do you think BAKKT will have that much of an effect on XRP? I know it will highlight more people into crypto but seen as it’s only focused on BTC I struggle to see how. But I hope so
827 2018-10-17 22:01:44 Yall know all these crypto projects that had ICOs are just spending ya money. Only few have use cases. Guess what.. they cant be audited!

850 2018-10-17 21:58:57 INSTEAD, they try to outdo each other in sensationalizing how horrible crypto is, which gets more ppl interested in this new and terrible thing. and that is what brings crypto to the mainstream.

863 2018-10-17 21:57:53 if media nocoiners really wanted to protect ppl from scams they would give crypto the penny-stock treatment: ignore it, relegate it to some niche publications, don't even acknowledge it as a thing worth talking about.

867 2018-10-17 21:57:18 $XMR - Monero is the largest privacy crypto currency which has active devs and efforts are made to keep it decentralized >  ASIC resistant.

870 2018-10-17 21:56:46 I'm dazzled by the fact, that people are now doing TA and are claiming things have suddenly turned bullish. Nothing has changed. Don't let smaller TF confuse you. Higher timeframes, which are superior, are still bearish. #bitcoin #crypto #technicalanalysis
871 2018-10-17 21:56:23 please, and I cant stress this enough, I'm no pro or seasoned vet. My first year in crypto and my primary function is mining, not trading. Friendly reminder to DYOR.

878 2018-10-17 21:55:33 Minimum wage is slavery, especially in third world countries. Here in Brazil it's less than $300 usd per month for a 9~5 job. 

I have no clue how ppl live with that, things only get more expensive.
879 2018-10-17 21:55:25 Curious about #Crypto youtubers traffic today compared to 2017.

888 2018-10-17 21:53:41 Yeah and like 4 employees at @coinbase have ties to #zrx.
889 2018-10-17 21:53:29 "verify. Don't trust " is a great saying for those who have crypto experience.

899 2018-10-17 21:51:06 Lol that’s is true, I think their stupid but this market is irrational at times. In April for example I pulled a 3x on weed coins leading up to 420. I figured they’d atleast pump a little.
900 2018-10-17 21:51:05 #Elastos is the best-kept secret in #crypto. It's on a steady climb w/ an outrageously low market cap (ranked #80 on @CoinMarketCap IIRC). There's nowhere to go but up.

919 2018-10-17 21:46:45 So much news in the crypto space is akin to someone growing a few ears of corn in a backyard garden but telling the world that must mean they’ve got another 640 acres of the stuff nobody has ever seen.

928 2018-10-17 21:45:29 Price cannot be interpreted independent of liquidity. Market Cap ignores liquidity and isn't useful in the real world, yet in the crypto space it's cited as a an objective valuation.

Let’s explore the weakness in this standard metric and introduce a Liquidity-Weighted Market Cap

937 2018-10-17 21:44:01 I flipped it a few times, made some profit, it had some nice pumps back then and project didnt seem dead but things have changed and I kept some small dust from back then, nothing to worry about
938 2018-10-17 21:43:46 I agree. However announcement for an announcement is what has created the ‘buy the rumour, sell the news’ trend. I used to like the good old days when people would actually buy on the bullish announcement!

985 2018-10-17 21:32:16 U talking ‘bout Mr Chummy

988 2018-10-17 21:32:08 I think they'll survive just like all the other crypto companies that are living even though they're not generating any revenue from businesses or customers. We're so far away from crypto being used by the masses that most of these projects survive on both community and traders.

991 2018-10-17 21:31:59 Yup. Some people make many plans and never stick to any, while others make few but commit to everyone of them.
992 2018-10-17 21:31:58 Am I to assume that you roll out a new mentorship program every year and old students have to listen to censored video commentaries? Shame you don't do an advanced video alongside the basic for new memberships.
993 2018-10-17 21:31:49 interestingly you never lose on any crypto trades.  be objective!!!
994 2018-10-17 21:31:37 Hey d-bag, ive been in weed stocks since 13. I traded a 21k heloc against my rental in 3Q14 to 224k, watched it plummet in the face of sec abuse of us weed stocks & still sold out w/ a 500% gain to pay my mortgage off 18 years early, the taxes & reinvested in crypto in 15.

1017 2018-10-17 21:26:45 Of course we care. Roubini is hilarious. His irrational hatred of crypto is both fascinating and hilarious - especially since he seems so sensitive to anyone calling him out for being a moron.  I'm waiting to see him spontaneously combust on his own vitriol.

1019 2018-10-17 21:25:59 Today’s lesson for myself: Do not copy anybody’s trade. Do not mess with low volume alts if you are too impatient to wait for weeks! It can be very profitable, there are tens of examples, though not for me! #crypto #cyrptolesson

1022 2018-10-17 21:25:45 It's called unmarked account trading. I mean if you wanna pay capital gains on every trade, by all means! Be honest. But I'm no schmuck, I'm not paying shit on what I consider play money, until I cash out. Especially in a marketplace so easy to protect/hide your wealth.

Unfortunately, I bought mine back when it was $5 
1059 2018-10-17 21:18:41 Sure it will, no problem at all. Think about it logically. We already hit 800 Billion. In the grand scheme of things that was with little crypto awareness and even less adoption. With only regular people like you and me investing. Bull of 17 will be nothing but a little bump& run

1084 2018-10-17 21:15:03 I agree w/ the first part in the sense of only investing in what you understand. I disagree on the last part about crypto heading to zero. Skeptics said that years ago. Yet the infrastructure keeps building despite R3 (the big banks pet blockchain project) shutting down...
1085 2018-10-17 21:14:53 Not I, said the cat.

1090 2018-10-17 21:14:46 damn we fly
1091 2018-10-17 21:14:44 There are actually some ppl who opened orders at 1 dollar and they got fulfilled, that was at the early days of crypto. When huge spikes occur. Now exchanges control sudden drops so that very low orders dont get fulfilled.
1092 2018-10-17 21:14:36 @cointracker_io What's the status on leveraging the crypto prices for the origin exchange as the basis for the portfolio totals calculation?
1093 2018-10-17 21:14:21 Their competitors are getting into crypto they have no choice...

1097 2018-10-17 21:13:35 6.5-7 tl den dolar alan insanlar vardı neden aldın ihtiyacın mı var ? 8-10 tl olacak diyorlar dı :))) duydukları ile aldılar bide o fiyattan 
1098 2018-10-17 21:13:08 Exactly. A good real estate investor doesn’t need to be also good in crypto in order to make a good “real estate on blockchain” investment. Bc the value is not on the technology. It’s about what value is introduced in the industry. The opposite though doesn’t apply.

1100 2018-10-17 21:12:37 meh, crypto does that in a few minutes.

we have a shitload of taxes, but not on that ;-)

they have good beer too! helps to deal with the weather!
1108 2018-10-17 21:11:28 Just like the stock market and legacy systems yes if there was frontrunning it was almost deffinatly from Wall Street stop the stupid attack’s on crypto they are pointless if you were not concerned about it why would you waste your time attacking it so we know your worried

1110 2018-10-17 21:11:19 Haha 
1111 2018-10-17 21:11:19 rather invest in projects that havn't multiplied so many times already since ICO, but looks cool
1112 2018-10-17 21:11:12 Nexo's  crypto-backed loan model is a perfect revolution for getting access to credit fast and without stupid checks&paperwork.. Hope this evolves to a credit model without interest and backed fully by crypto assets of the loan applicant.

1132 2018-10-17 21:08:34 I agree. Almost all bear markets end with capitulation, and we have yet to see this yet. :| Not sure if this varies in the new era crypto market since there are so many permabulls lol. It happened in 2013/14 however.

1137 2018-10-17 21:08:12 to be honest, I don't even want to try to attempt to game the crypto trade. I have my own personal opinion on the whole thing, hence why I stick to what I know: stocks and options. IMHO, if/when central banks start their own crypto, Bitcoin et al go to 0 right quick
1138 2018-10-17 21:08:09 And also.. when asked about a Link moon mission.. my magic 8 ball said "seems likely".  I had to shake it a few times but still gotta be a good omen right?

1148 2018-10-17 21:06:58 I'm genuinely curious...if there is a better product on the market, why  would someone use anything else? When I say better, in the case of crypto, I mean cheaper and faster. Is it sentimentality, or am I missing something? #BTC #XRP
1149 2018-10-17 21:06:44 @winklevoss everything @WhalePanda asked is not only super easy in the crypto space it ought to be mandatory.  Of course, no framework exists for it in the traditional financial world.  That is like asking how do I plug this supercharger into my horse?

1156 2018-10-17 21:05:56 Whenever the bulltun comes to a conclusion
1157 2018-10-17 21:05:41 You purchase an #altcoin at a great price.  You're swing trading your  $crypto; selling at 10, 20, maybe 50% profit, hoping to rebuy lower.

But...it never happens. The coin keeps going up, leaving you behind, & you watch the position you patiently accumulated go 5-10x.
1158 2018-10-17 21:05:39 Cpc never claimed this. It is just you claiming they claimed it. A lot of claims, not so much facts.

I keep mine locked up in the safe with the recovery phrases and PW. if you lose it, you can be SOL. however, that is up to you to keep it safe. If you let your crypto sit online, then somebody else could take it.

1163 2018-10-17 21:04:23 What a great initiative. As a web developer i can say that this is very helpful. This framework will simplify the way that Dapps are develop. Just another reason to love $CURV
1164 2018-10-17 21:04:07 Just said for crypto overall 
1165 2018-10-17 21:04:05 They should just hire justinsuntron bot.. It never shits up
1166 2018-10-17 21:03:42 If a trader likes to play extremely safe during market volatility, he or she can trade btc - euro or usd on many platforms. As well other crypto-euro-usd pairs are available. Withdrawal is fast ( swift fast ) and no stable coin needed.
1167 2018-10-17 21:03:41 Maybe. Coinbases antipathy toward XRP goes back a long way. I think it is much more likely that they are acting in accordance with their "philosophical" approach to crypto than making a reasoned legal decision. But that's just me.

1170 2018-10-17 21:03:10 We love the three c's - crypto, coffee and collaboration. Definitely something we should explore. :)
1171 2018-10-17 21:03:08 I wouldve answered yes, just because crypto actually gives me a tech boner. I love my internet money and im never gonna give it back. I love Bitcoin, I love ETH, and I love services build around them. It is actually taking control away from the established actors of this world.
1172 2018-10-17 21:03:01 Doesnt matter.

1197 2018-10-17 20:59:57 Why so?
1198 2018-10-17 20:59:49 Crypto doesn't audition for business. Business auditions for crypto.

1200 2018-10-17 20:59:02 Sorry that was a fat finger - please disregard …
Oh BTW - can we be crypto friends? xD
1201 2018-10-17 20:58:55 Cryptopians have transcended the need for archetypal leaders and social ranking and now rely on math to accomplish goals fluidly and cohesively with no apparent leader. We don't look to a leader anymore. 

But in reality, a shortsighted interpretation of who we think Satoshi is.
1202 2018-10-17 20:58:51 It's 2018 and I'm still yet to see a FMCG company that's promoting their products by offering a chance to win bitcoins. #bitcoin #crypto $BTC
1203 2018-10-17 20:58:50 Use to be intriguing but unfortunately there won’t be a million txs like they originally thought was possible. Going to be like a few hundred to 1k probably in beginning.
1204 2018-10-17 20:58:28 Dont.  Why should you do that. You can have more follower without a giveaway. Thats my opinion. Keep up the good work 
1205 2018-10-17 20:58:22 It is relevant to #blockchain and $crypto too, because FUD, FOMO, and "fake news" coming from people with influence can make people hesitate to invest when they otherwise would or choose an option that would otherwise get ignored.
1206 2018-10-17 20:58:16 Did you start using the internet because of all the fancy protocols?

Probably not.

We started using it because it gave us the freedom to connect with anyone, anywhere.

$Crypto is the same.

People won’t use it bc of blockchain, they’ll use it to enhance their freedom & control
1207 2018-10-17 20:58:09 What if crypto wallets have opt-out honeypot side-wallets as a security measure?

What if real-time monitoring is incorporated and provides distress notifications, automatic transfer of main wallet contents to a specified escrow/custodian/safe recovery wallet?

1209 2018-10-17 20:57:19 haha your wat to confident about your 'ta' the market is manipulated as fuck. and they dont give a shit about your gaps. i say it here once more.. like it or not. its a fact. what about there would come news 2morrow about huge adoption.. u still think your gaps get filled grow up
1210 2018-10-17 20:57:18 Please post a screenshot.. lmaooo
1211 2018-10-17 20:57:16 Depends on capital and the risk amount your okay with and the 100x positioning.
 There are very few occasions that you use entire account balance
Most of the the time I risk 8% of account balance, more dependening on my confidence.
1212 2018-10-17 20:57:15 I mean, take today for example. Just a regular ole Wednesday. Bill Gates foundation has announced expansion of partnership with Coil, Nexo have launched XRP-backed loans, and Omni announced cashouts in XRP. Just a regular ole Wednesday. All of those Ripple been a catalyst in
1213 2018-10-17 20:57:13 Projects like XVG BEE CV ... may not be around long.. Those market caps are going to be adopted into the working projects.. The more coins fall off the market,  the more value to the coins that survive.. it won’t take much when large investors see which projects are solid.

They should know their subject though. It's basically the equivalent of me trying to teach a knitting class.

1249 2018-10-17 20:52:11 Nice question man! The chart shows me a major move is coming in crypto. 
I have been saying it multiple times because I think it will happen anytime soon. Unfortunetaly it is taking way longer that I expected but we will get there.Crossing my fingers here and hoping for uptrend
1250 2018-10-17 20:52:08 Bad regulation is worse than no regulation, but thoughtful regulation is better than both

What are the chances we get thoughtful regulation in crypto?
1251 2018-10-17 20:52:05 Everyone who owns XLM gets paid the same 1% (of your holdings) inflation so long as you take 5 minutes and set your inflation destination. If you are too lazy to do that, you shouldn't be buying crypto.
1252 2018-10-17 20:51:52 I couldn't ever trust $usdt, no real reason behind it, just a hunch, if my #alts drop, $btc is where I go, #tether has no purpose for me, it isn't really #crypto and it definitley isn't #fiat. 

DYOR but if you're going to #hodl your bags, dont do it with tether. Use #Bitcoin

1277 2018-10-17 20:47:56  You forgot one:

Q: Is it still possible to get filthy rich trading crypto?

A: Gambling is not a solid investment strategy. "Luck" rewards the investors and traders who stay informed about their investments and remember that $BTC didn't go from $.003 to over $6000 in a day.
1278 2018-10-17 20:47:52 Tron bought cloud service. They aren't partners. Disappointing
1279 2018-10-17 20:47:42 They put on a stress test from time to time, but OF COURSE it doesn't raise tx costs because everybody knows that the test will end! Meanwhile BTC is constantly under stress. They're so full of themselves, I hardly can wait for some mass acceptance that'll kill those 32MB blocks.
1280 2018-10-17 20:47:41 Being able to affect price is not the same as having control over the network and its properties.

1302 2018-10-17 20:44:27 Think @BasilMarte and @ProfPieters gave good answers.
If cryptos were the *only* alternative to US$, might be a diversification vs risk case for holding a small amount of crypto.
But better (safer, more liquid, higher return?) alternatives exist.

1319 2018-10-17 20:41:43 And I think sending a transaction is far too easy to block. It’s not easy right now but you can send a tx with pretty much any form of communication. Embedded in a picture, through text, drop it in a comment section in a site if you know some node is looking there.

1333 2018-10-17 20:39:49 Great q. There will be attempts and failures and bugs in code but any issue that pops up will eventually get fixed. The one true barrier if they really want to stop it I believe is hashrate. Moneros hashrate would bend over to nation state funding of prob under 2 billion.

1342 2018-10-17 20:37:46 Why do you always draw comparisons to BTC all the time. It was a very easy question. You don’t argue that you devote your life to a coin where a single entity owns more than half of it and then still live in denial that it isn’t centralised

1345 2018-10-17 20:37:07 #FUD has become a very over used term in crypto. It’s now become an excuse to not have legitimate concerns.

1356 2018-10-17 20:36:01 Excellent
1357 2018-10-17 20:36:00 No, I don’t accept that. And neither do bitcoiners. As otherwise they’d have to confront the reality that Bitcoin would have been centralised by that definition at the start.

1410 2018-10-17 20:27:10 Their solution to scale the number of transactions will work short term, the problem is that the bigger the blocks get the more centralized the blockchain will become. The only way to keep the blockchain decentralized is with 2nd and 3rd layer solutions bc they avoid txs onchain.

1449 2018-10-17 20:21:32 How small Crypto space compared to just the US markets, but yet there are so many things that are happening (@TDAmeritrade , @Bakkt , possible ETF, @Fidelity ).  If you can't see that cryptos are about to launch past the Voyager 1 spacecraft then you are not paying attention 
1450 2018-10-17 20:21:21 The fact that coinbase is not adding the only crypto that is actually being used speaks alot about what they actually care about.
1451 2018-10-17 20:21:20 Oh, go for it.  I love experiments that have a high probability of failure. 

Although the crypto/blockchain groupies would probably bite.

1476 2018-10-17 20:18:10 Yes, and what has that got to do with centralisation?
1477 2018-10-17 20:18:10 That opinion in MAY is what the comment is about. Crypto TA was pretty much unanimous about 6k retouch. The only debate is whether this is the bottom, or we drop by November or go to 10k and continue bear in q1-2019
1478 2018-10-17 20:18:04 Smart move. I’ve never been a fan of it! I just believe it will pump when coinbase adds it.
1479 2018-10-17 20:18:03 Remind myself that people in traditional finance make 5-10% trading/investing avg per year and that is like top notch. If you're making some 2x or whatever in Crypto these past few weeks..congrats! and let's be humble. $RVN $XHV $XTL $TUBE

1484 2018-10-17 20:17:11 If a fund would like to put money into crypto assets and the manager says: "Oh, we just use BitGo or Coinbase" it is a pretty difficult pitch.

1503 2018-10-17 20:13:42 The way I see Crypto;

 It’s  like we all have to write a test , but only we got the information way in advance and everyone else is only getting it now... we have a massive advantage!
1504 2018-10-17 20:13:41 But I don't understand what what has to do with XRP being decentralised?
1505 2018-10-17 20:13:33 I see the OGs coming out now, shilling their long forgotten #bittrex bags. That's nice though - higher chance of getting a decent alt run before end of year. $crypto
1506 2018-10-17 20:13:11 Definitely. Watch out for snakes.
1507 2018-10-17 20:13:07 It would likely affect the price, yes. Just like if Blockstream, or Lightning Labs were to go bankrupt. Or another bank says it is not going to use BTC.

1520 2018-10-17 20:11:38 Ok, well this changed quickly. Forgot my 20% $BTC was my $BTC from selling $OCN. When the inverse head and shoulders broke out on its chart I bought in, so minimal $BTC now. Up 20% with $OCN though. It is a great one to trade via TA, many wins with it this month.

1529 2018-10-17 20:10:31 Furthermore, it's not the job of Dogecoin (or, I know this is a shock--the purpose of crypto) to 'get you a lambo'. Suggestion: Get informed, learn, run the numbers and realize how little the inflation actually matters in comparison to other coins.
1530 2018-10-17 20:10:19 A fcking hypocrite!! You're ok with all of the above but not crypto and you're trying to sale this notion to people as if its intelligent? It's not if anything your statement makes absolutely no sense and neither do your reasons but good luck with that 
1531 2018-10-17 20:09:50 Question 2. If Satoshi's wallet was emptied tomorrow and all of the coins were sent to an exchange, would that affect the BTC value and give negative confidence (lol) in it?
1532 2018-10-17 20:09:47 While I generally find the #Bitcoin community more knowledgeable concerncing the economics relevant to the monetary landscape of crypto, there’s an element of path-dependent limitation that comes alongside such knowledge.

This blind spot should be acknowledged by the community.
1533 2018-10-17 20:09:40 It's 'in vogue' to mistrust with everyone and everything. Use GMail? You're a sheeple. Use Protonmail? Better, but still sheeple. Better roll your own email server. Also, PGP/GPG had that one issue once, so you better roll your own crypto also, just to be safe

1539 2018-10-17 20:08:24 This is a tactic to crypto that I adopt, nice to have this suggested by a pro like yourself, I was embarrassed by my simplistic approach but hey, if you have available funds to accumulate on the dips, then keep catching them I say..

1555 2018-10-17 20:07:13 That was like 5 months ago Jim. Now it’s maybe .20 cents. See, things move “fast” In the crypto world. Very small transaction fees coming soon. Buy Litecoin! Oh and that crypto you hate, will only increase per unit due to its low inflationary measures. USD not so much.

1565 2018-10-17 20:05:10 Ah thanks. I have mixed feelings about this. But then, look at the growth and success of services like M-Pesa. Let's see how this plays out.
1566 2018-10-17 20:05:02 good to focus on crypto first
1567 2018-10-17 20:05:00 Actually, there have no country can take advantage in crypto.
The "country" is a by-product of Westfälischer Friede.
You can not expect a 400 years old "order" to take advantage 
Only decentralized community can secure immutable coins.
1568 2018-10-17 20:05:00 Interestingly enough, spoke to few mates who moved money from crypto into weed stocks.

They noticing alts are starting to move again and moving money back into crypto.

Does this mean its almost....

1575 2018-10-17 20:04:05 I love how many arguments crypto has answers for. I’m not so good at explaining blockchain, but when I do, I often have some answer to pull out to counter negative sentiments. It’s global, mining is incentivized, it’s limited in supply, it’s a public ledger, it evolved... I try.

1580 2018-10-17 20:03:27 In a smart card system the card's identifying secret never leaves the card. It's minted in the card, and instead of passing the secret over the wire, the secret is used to sign (as in public key crypto sign) the transaction details.

1647 2018-10-17 19:53:25 I laught when I hear that crypto are too much expensive to invest in now.. they will fell broke when they will see the price next 5 years.. if you miss 2 opportunities, then you are not made to have cash.

1652 2018-10-17 19:52:39 All these crimes you're insinuating on the darknet or dark markets have been happening since the beginning of time with all the other currencies!!! So what's the difference with crypto?

1655 2018-10-17 19:52:26 Awesome to see you back on the project. To be completely honest, it’s very difficult to gauge what your opinion is going to be on crypto topics. You have a unique perspective and are never afraid of thinking differently or going against the grain. Something I respect a lot.
1656 2018-10-17 19:52:20 Beautiful isn't it?
1657 2018-10-17 19:51:57 may as well throw out the 21 million limit whilst you are at it.
1658 2018-10-17 19:51:43 I wonder why Uganda specifically. It's not one of the top economies on the continent. But seems to have low % access to formal financial institutions. Would be interesting to follow.

1667 2018-10-17 19:51:15 Yes, @AliantPayment will work when they remove the monthly fee and start charging only a transaction fee... crypto payments don’t occur as often as fiat payements, I would still like to offer that option but only if I can hedge and withdraw in fiat directly to my bank account

1669 2018-10-17 19:50:50 Worse yet, as they print vaster quantities of money with nothing backing the value but "faith" in a market that is manipulated by the same money managers, our labour becomes worthless. A formality overcome by printing more meaningless paper. Crypto will worsen this.

1683 2018-10-17 19:48:52 It hurts me, seeing people criticise bitcoin or crypto and they don't know much about it..

And the darknet has existed way before crypto currency came in the picture! Hiw was the darknet sustainable before crypto currency?? Using cash, fiat.
1760 2018-10-17 19:39:31 Like #USDTether? Or a bunch of DOJ/SEC investigations closing exchanges.  Tail risk is very high in crypto right now.

1762 2018-10-17 19:39:11 Incredibly unlikely. Profit taking near last ATH's would be pretty massive I believe. I would sell everything near previous ATH's if there's nothing significant pushing the price (mass adoption, major use with businesses, etc)

1785 2018-10-17 19:36:01 Well said
1786 2018-10-17 19:35:59 Because almost no coin has real massive adoption (or use case) every coin pumps and dumps together. So for trx to hit $1 that means every other coin would also have to reach a parabolic increase, which means for trx to hit that, pretty much all coins would have insane values.
1787 2018-10-17 19:35:52 The bottom will fall out, despair and sell off will ensue, big money  will accumulate, then and only then will we see moon... When we have forfeited our #bitcoin in return for fiat, and the big boys have all our crypto. 

Back to square one.

Or so I've heard.

1804 2018-10-17 19:33:30 Is it possible with the influx of money though? Btw have you looked at #LINK compared to #ENG? Would be interested in you thoughts!
1805 2018-10-17 19:33:28 Pump my bags, Donalt, pump 'em.

Excellent well written threads and medium articles.
1829 2018-10-17 19:30:11 Futures on Crypto buys are not the same as buys into Crypto itself. Futures on Crypto have the potential to put Cryptos on the sidelines ..
Take a look at the Money Markets to see what i mean..
1830 2018-10-17 19:29:51 #crypto #cryptocurrency #ethereum

About ETH price: I think ETH converted to fiat, seen in costs to transact on the Network, is one of the most important determinants of the price of ETH. If the ETH price goes to high then it becomes too expensive to transact (gas fees etc).

1840 2018-10-17 19:28:26 Guys, please don’t share your crypto portfolio on CT/telegram/social media.  You become walking targets.  It is dangerous and it’s nobody’s business.  Be safe out there!  #cryptocurrencies
1841 2018-10-17 19:28:22 Awesome. Way to educate the world in crypto!
1842 2018-10-17 19:28:22 The project very lucrative as the crypto market is stabling now so good profit expected in coming months.

1849 2018-10-17 19:27:12 Three figures are quite reachable in 2019 but I have to say that it is not the only crypto :-) There are many other good projects which need time but I can see the way you put it as a clean understanding of the market. Things will change dramatically in the upcoming months ;-)
1850 2018-10-17 19:27:07 I don’t know about you but the feedback I receive about crypto this days from the people around me is complete disbelief... #crypto #CryptoNews #cryptokitties #cryptotwitter

1953 2018-10-17 19:12:52 Ok I acknowledge your wording, I thought the level was 7200? But my question was more or less why did you expect anything else. It seemed rather binary and expected.
1954 2018-10-17 19:12:48 We have 2.5 months 
1955 2018-10-17 19:12:43 I would probably throw in on Tron. 

Because they have the money to make stuff happen and have a solid marketing team. 

With eth testing the water, I think TRX will have a better opportunity to succeed. 

I could be way off though, there are many good choices out there.
1956 2018-10-17 19:12:36 1. How do you block someone you've shared your crypto keys with from accessing ur account.
2. Or d big paper is getting values as in our current money or it contains all your savings.

1962 2018-10-17 19:12:10 Crypto is going full parody. Im having serious difficulties figuring out if reality is being satire and my only drug is CT
1963 2018-10-17 19:12:08 Market agrees with my interpretation i.e. liquidity issues, not solvency issues, or crypto would be crashing rather than be slightly higher.
1964 2018-10-17 19:12:07 Francis, from one Canadian to another. Do you think this was done properly? As a consumer and employed in a business that involves driving daily, I think they butchered the regulations and laws by rushing things so hard and have no idea the consequences this will have on everyone

1975 2018-10-17 19:10:46 I believe the logic has two major inputs, TypeOfComms and NATState. Yes, IPv6 is great for many mobile networks, there are also UDP NAT-busting tricks they pull.

2072 2018-10-17 19:00:05 In my experience, mobile messaging apps have very complicated logic to decide if they send P2P, through a PoP or through a data center.

2087 2018-10-17 18:58:30 Well someone who hides behind a screen and depends on # of followers is exactly what it is. Time will set the board right. Besides crypto twitter is more of an amusement park. Focus on the important, filter the noise.

2101 2018-10-17 18:57:03 I'm sorry—I don't understand. That's only true if it's peer-to-peer messaging, but I think that almost all services are switched at the service provider, e.g., Apple or Facebook. The ISP can't read that traffic if it's encrypted.

2106 2018-10-17 18:56:06 Great news Horizon State hst is such a great company and has the best community behind it. Winner of the world economic forum 2018 WEF joining likes of google. This is the reason why hst is a stand out. A real token with real world use rare in crypto.
2107 2018-10-17 18:56:03 Lets see, do we add the 3rd most valuable crypto? Nah, lets add 0x, I mean its not like 3 people working at Coinbase have affiliation with the 0x project and couldnt benefit from it. Heaven forbid they should add xrp, stellar or cardano! for shame coinbase
2108 2018-10-17 18:55:47 Or just copy and paste the code being the much bigger company...
2109 2018-10-17 18:55:29 all the crypto will disappear too, as usual..

2116 2018-10-17 18:54:59 There is no any #crypto regulation at all per se.

2165 2018-10-17 18:48:38 Someday, people will be stressing out because the overall marketcap crashed down to only 1 trillion; they bought $DERO at $280 & it will then be down to $90

They'll call crypto a ponzi scam & call you lucky for having profits

Current cost is $1.55... will repost in a few years
2166 2018-10-17 18:48:17 It’s a shame you have had to say that. Hopefully not getting hounded by some people 
2167 2018-10-17 18:47:25 The true believers will stick around. Yes a shame they manage to succeed with their plan to make crypto less popular. This is not only about believe but superior technology and the future.

2221 2018-10-17 18:40:08 Yes, but they don't care about their retail or institutional investors.  They just want to collect fees and BTC is the most liquid crypto. But let's not worry about that now because just to get more people in crypto is good, and BTC will "trickle down" to XRP of course, too.
2222 2018-10-17 18:40:04 Where the hell did we talk about honesty? We are talking about doing more for the community, and enabling millions of people to buy crypto is doing more than 99.9% of people. Also he's a huge advocate for the industry.
2223 2018-10-17 18:40:01 If you thought 2017 $crypto went hard, with only retail investors pushing the market cap close to a $1T, wait until 2019, when the big money pushes it 5x higher.

2225 2018-10-17 18:39:52 The best thing about mining is that when mining it is not that you are only earning the crypto, you are also helping transaction go through, you are also contributing to the cryptocurrency ecosystem and that I think is the best thing. #mamaimaminer #iamaminer

2227 2018-10-17 18:39:42 $ostk i think alot of the short is related to bitcoin since most funds have no vehicle to short crypto price so they use ostk right or wrong as a barometer to this. If and when sec lets etfs into bitcoin game and they will this wil really help alleviate the problem here.
2228 2018-10-17 18:39:42 Exchanges are the new ICO. Not saying Beaxy is bad. They threw a great party in Chicago haha. But in a world where exchanges are becoming the new ICOs it's important to know going into it what makes them legit and not a cash grab.

2236 2018-10-17 18:38:41 I really like your ideas, but I gotta say I will disagree here.  If that was a tether spike, it means most of that money exited crypto altogether due to the dump.  I´m not seeing much volume except for leverage liquidation run.  There is nothing "organic" in this market right now

2239 2018-10-17 18:37:56 Exactly. Keep awareness of features. Even if people are suckered or have intensional use for XRP (centralized), the realization of good quality attributes with good living experiences without restrictions of use; with any group governed crypto that doesn’t use labor for proof.

2243 2018-10-17 18:37:22 I'm skeptical of a best seller list of trading books on getting wealthy. It would be like watching Dr. Oz & going out to practice medicine. Better reads are those that help you recognize a coming wave. In crypto now & the tech bubble in 1999, it wasn't the traders who got rich...

2253 2018-10-17 18:36:19 The point is: @Waltonchain has the first-mover advantage.  Not VeChain.  Only those who have been swindled into believing otherwise invested in VeChain.  Therein lies the fraud and deception.

2268 2018-10-17 18:34:25 Do you think the institutions investing in crypto know that BTC is shit ?

2299 2018-10-17 18:30:09 Indeed, until then we must keep fighting the good fight to educate + inform both newcomers & existing crypto community members alike. The importance of decentralized & a trustless permissionless chain like LTC doesn't escape me
2300 2018-10-17 18:29:59 AHHH crypto-twinsies  He is a very rare creature 
2301 2018-10-17 18:29:47 But of course you can just just XRP like any other crypto (albeit, it is generally faster and cheaper than most). I had to transfer some BTC from one exchange to the other yesterday. Took an hour! I'm used to taking a few seconds with XRP.
2302 2018-10-17 18:29:37 I wonder if there is any good research out there for the latent demand for tokens. Every time a well known exchange lists one, the price goes up tremendously in anticipation. Liquidity premiums are significant in this space. #crypto #bitcoin #ethereum
2303 2018-10-17 18:29:21 It’s fud. This is crypto. They’re claim means nothing.

2370 2018-10-17 18:18:35 crypto whales think in terms of accumulation and distribution. they do not care if a coin stays down for a year. they’ll just accumulate more of it and distribute some on each breakout attempt.
2371 2018-10-17 18:18:33 Yeah I mostly spec mine when they come out to get like half a node. And supplement to a full one after that. There are some small ones like gobyte that I run, or Apollon, Smartcash, Infinex... (sub 500 bucks)

2379 2018-10-17 18:17:19 This is why $NPXS is going to be huge. They are making crypto easier to access, they are building the infrastructure, the real value. Their new XPhone and the XPoS device are helping to spread the usefulness  and value of $crypto around the world.
2380 2018-10-17 18:17:16 It'd be neat if you could use crypto signing to detect lies from the productive sector, yes. But the parasitic sector? Why waste the effort? You can already tell when a politician is lying, right?

1##Moneycontrol News are base less..They unnecessary increasing FUD in indian crypto lovers.

Bitcoin or any altcoin is neither  illegal nor supreme court says like this. Only RBI restricted transection through banks.
2387 2018-10-17 18:16:13 Agreed! I do not think it's bullish at all. Tether holders were/are basically being forced to buy anything they can with their USDT. Not because they want to, but because they have to. Those assets that were bought, will get sold into fiat pairs. I'm very bearish
2388 2018-10-17 18:16:12 1. Hadn't looked at your picture yet but after I did, you surely deserve the compliment! 

2. Many reports are spotted, some happen directly and some take years to manifest. And if you have been in crypto for such a long time you know that many things he says are very possible.

2392 2018-10-17 18:16:03 It's hard to say they would go into this without having to address these things. Especially with the team behind NEX.

2400 2018-10-17 18:15:11 @qiibee Im newbie in the crypto currency realm, thus, i don't understand how this really goes. However, i maintain the willingness to learn, hopefully, some one will be good enough to step up and teach me a thing or two on how to go about crypto currency, blockchain, etc.
2401 2018-10-17 18:15:09 Done, happy to participate in imp giveaway !!!
2402 2018-10-17 18:14:56 Yes, we very well could. But we already hit 5800, as I said, it’s already been hit. Going back to it makes no difference in the larger picture. I laddered at 6100-5800 and am happy to wait for another trip to 5800. Tho I don’t think that happens.
2403 2018-10-17 18:14:48 After a morning at the Digital Asset Strategies Summit, I'm still crypto-skeptical, but some of my reservations have been eroded. There will be a story or 2 and at least 1 blog post about digital assets coming in the near future.

2417 2018-10-17 18:13:06 I know you disagree but I think BTC will be a natural hedge for wealthy individuals in a downturn of stocks. I think that’s why you see major institutions putting the infrastructure in place now to offer. Plebs don’t even have to enter, because elite investors move the markets
2418 2018-10-17 18:12:59 Why I am not currently a position trader? I don’t think we are seeing the bottom of alts. I’ll get to why shortly. $btc $eth $crypto

2421 2018-10-17 18:12:40 Crypto, based in open-blockchains can coexist together, they improve and learn from others crypto, Fiat vs crypto, is a zero-sum game, Fiat are closed systems where innovación has died long time ago.

2427 2018-10-17 18:11:54 Mine target is solely based on TA. So my target will remain $5800 Since NOT 1 of my gap charts has been wrong. And when the gaps on BTC get filled in the $5900 area we will land on the next support of $5800. After that its anyone guess. But we will hit $5800, You'll see
2428 2018-10-17 18:11:49 There is dozens of articles/pieces that can explain it better than I can. It just baffles me that with 90% of the projects out there being utterly useless, people pick probably the most legit company that has come out of crypto and say its fraudulent and people believe them....

2443 2018-10-17 18:08:55 @crypto_cpa @CryptoTaxGirl when handling taxes for crypto, in the US, would you treat staking rewards the way you'd treat traditional dividends?

2476 2018-10-17 18:06:13 People who are actually making money with trading don't have paid groups. That's like Crypto Twitter 1:1. Burn it in your head.
2477 2018-10-17 18:06:12 would you criticize @ToneVays if he went long instead of short?
2478 2018-10-17 18:06:08 Buying crypto now is investing, because with no early adopters who take the risk now, we will not have mainstream adoption in the future!
2479 2018-10-17 18:06:00 When people realize that most of the processing work for smart contracts can be done through LINK off chain, which essentially acts as a scaling solution for smart contract platforms, major major FOMO is going to kick in...

2483 2018-10-17 18:05:24 STOP THE HATE ABOUT THIS!

When a big company will present anything, they put out a press release announcing a press conference, announcing something 

And here we complain if a crypto company says they will announce something next week.  Let them be. 
Creating attention and buzz
2484 2018-10-17 18:05:21 That’s event driven but I did buy some just not on my recommended list

2489 2018-10-17 18:04:34 Or how about the hundreds of companies that have tried "disrupt craigslist"? Or taking it back to crypto again, the sites that have done a much better job than Coinmarketcap yet earn a fraction of the visitors as CMC?

2500 2018-10-17 18:02:51 Mr. Roubini, on behalf of the sane people in crypto I apologize for how you have been treated. Your core assertion only represents a small fraction of #bitcoins true use cases but the level of disrespect crypto bros have shown you is not civilized. I will read your paper sir!
2501 2018-10-17 18:02:48 I know... I'm a failure to the whole crypto community 
2502 2018-10-17 18:02:47 Totally agree - got some more yesterday.....after I got happy with what the 400m out of supply are earmarked for (e.g won't be dumped into circulation).

2504 2018-10-17 18:02:38 For those just joining the #crypto space, find some quality accounts to follow, read, DOYR and find ways to educate yourself. A great and inexpensive option are platforms like @udemy and @coursera which have a nice variety of crypto related courses to go through

2506 2018-10-17 18:01:56 If they get the equivalent to NetFlow data from the ISP of two people, which is my understanding of a pen register in this context, then it would be trivial to prove they were communicating with one another.

2577 2018-10-17 17:53:50 if mainstream outlets weren't legitimizing crypto hucksters, no one would adopt it. eg: My aunt doesn't read coindesk or twitter, she would never have heard of bitcoin if not for MSM. Thanks to NYTimes et al, she bought her first bitcoin at the top last year!
2578 2018-10-17 17:53:50 I’d disagree, many indications (which are what you should use; not mob sentiment) show we reached the bottom a month ago. Listening to the scared will leave you w/ less profit. Volatility, price action & volume clearly shows as much of a capitulation as we are going to get. #btc

2640 2018-10-17 17:46:43 To give just one example, there are many crypto hucksters attempting to introduce utterly inappropriate blockchain-based solutions to areas of public life, including public policy. Some of us see plenty of need to protect our institutions from scammers.

2658 2018-10-17 17:43:52 Hi, as you may know Bitcoin is a currency that has constant fluctuations, so you might see differences in the amount sent and received due to currency conversions. Bear in mind that the rate used for the conversion will be the one available at the moment the payout is processed.

2681 2018-10-17 17:41:52 I have to disagree with this statement. 

FA in crypto to me means determining the relationship of price with events, on-chain data, market sentiment, developer activity, code, crypto economics.

Many of these are objective and quantifiable, not subjective (albeit experimental)

2709 2018-10-17 17:38:50 Who cares anyway it's a trader's shenaningan. It's a good time to accumulate, not everyone has 100k cash upfront so investing at the levels per week or month seems good
2710 2018-10-17 17:38:47 Good luck expanding the narrow set of situations where fiduciary liability has been imposed to try and regulate software development throughout the world.

2766 2018-10-17 17:32:08 You. For asking.
2767 2018-10-17 17:32:08 I will continue to hold my $5800 target. It might not be the bottom but we will touch that IMHO do I know if we are going lower? I wish I knew sir. But I am confident $5800 will met. Only time will tell brother.
2768 2018-10-17 17:32:01 Bear market (downtrend)

Ranging market/Bottom (non-trend)

Bull market (uptrend)

The bottom is where we see lots of sideways price action (i.e. consolidation) 

The bottom is where price gathers strength for a shift in trend to the upside via accumulation.

2771 2018-10-17 17:31:38 I tend to disagree in that one because we know good tech alone doesn't not make one product successful, without a strong community behind a crypto it will an uphill battle. Dogecoin is a great example (not shilling).

2774 2018-10-17 17:31:28 Crypto Twitter misuses the term fundamental analysis. 

In stocks, FA means focusing on a company's books. Book value/share, P:E ratio, growth rates, debt:equity ratio, etc.

In crypto, FA traders act on speculative news and their own subjective opinion of a coin's/team's future

2788 2018-10-17 17:29:07 When I got into crypto, I knew it would be a long term situation. So, I see these low prices as a blessing. All the more I, and others, can accumulate! Beside, the prices may be low, but under the hood, Bitcoin/Litecoin/LN, etc are revving up their engines!
2789 2018-10-17 17:29:05 >> In contrast, one cannot even own crypto tokens.  One can only have only control of them.  If a hacker gets or guesses your private key, he gets control too, and can move them out of your reach.  You cannot go to the police and say "those bitcoins are mine, get them back".

2791 2018-10-17 17:29:02 I’m into crypto because I’ve been waiting for it since I was a kid. Our current system is cumbersome and an embarassement. Crypto solves those problems. I can’t wait until the whole planet is using it,
2792 2018-10-17 17:28:58 I understand the AML concerns from the exchanges but companies like Chainanalysis do nothing more than kill the anonymity and privacy that made crypto so attractive in the beginning.   We know they already providing govts with the tools need to track crypto transactions.
2793 2018-10-17 17:28:58 Eventually we will all have CC backed by $crypto allowing us to abandon the traditional economic fiat models. Until then sites like @roomofsatoshi and @myBylls will ease the transition.

2802 2018-10-17 17:27:39 P2P transactions are great. I think most of us would happily do it if it were viable options. However in the absence of it there are many ways you can essentially do the same transaction with a CC. $BTC is a replacement for fiat and CC is a supplement to both.

2812 2018-10-17 17:26:20 What about all the projects using their crypto (directly/indirectly) to hire developers to build things. That crypto only has value if other people are willing to buy it. So yes, buying crypto does contribute to the ecosystem and does fund development.

2844 2018-10-17 17:23:14 The connection between ownership of stock tokens (shares) and ownership of slices of the company and its assets is not "predending"!  It is solidly established by laws and contracts.

2903 2018-10-17 17:13:32 An encouraging concept to bring this benefit to the mainstream is through a crypto-backed lending so coin holders can borrow fiat money against crypto. It utilizes current infrastructure, not disturbing it. $nexo lending does just that. Check it out.

How are we managing dilution to token value with POS? A lot of other POS coins had lost a lot of value with increased supply of tokens
2919 2018-10-17 17:11:13 If @Nouriel, like most of us, see signs of a depression coming in 2020 where exactly is the safe haven? Gold (not easily spent and you still have to interact with the fiat economy to do so)? Wouldn't something not tied to a fiat economy be viable? #BTC

2924 2018-10-17 17:10:13 Thanks Ed, I think your connection to a services & physical goods exchange makes a lot of sense. The infrastructure fits the use case and the enterprise alliance for the supply of services & goods will develop over time. I’m curious how user friendly it will be for ‘no-coiners’

2942 2018-10-17 17:07:14 So @bhorowitz is wrong about his investment thesis about crypto?
2943 2018-10-17 17:07:05 Must be painful to see XRP listed as Ripple on Bitmex
2944 2018-10-17 17:07:05 Is their criminal acts happening with cash yes or no? Was all these bad things happening with cash before crypto yes or no? So what the fck is the difference between cash and crypto? You have no idea what you're talking about and your brain is the size of a peanut.

Why would anyone stay in BTC?
2967 2018-10-17 17:06:11 No. Blockchain and crypto utility will bring it to the masses. They will bring it to wealthy but interesting investors.

2973 2018-10-17 17:05:43 I feel sorry for the people just sitting around waiting to get "rich" off crypto. You gotta get out there and make shit happen. Whether it's trading, branding, marketing, consulting, media creation, or whatever. Stop waiting for handouts and lotto tickets. Earn your spot!
2974 2018-10-17 17:05:41 C'est ça. Disons que les comptes wirex sont une solution légale car tt en ayant un wallet en crypto vous pouvez retirer ou payer en fiat, mais évidemment de manière fort réduite. Comme tu dis, la meilleure option est de filer ailleurs.
2975 2018-10-17 17:05:30 $Tsla feels like a super super bullish altcoin that will pop anytime soon - soon in stock time is years compared to months in crypto but still I’m super bullish on $Tsla might look for an entry around eoy or Q1 2019 .. might dollar cost average in

3027 2018-10-17 16:59:45 Even in crypto it's human nature to be tribal. Now we pick sides based on call letters. I have faith at some point we'll get it together.  However things tend to get worse before they get better. Great chatting with you. Great calls!

3032 2018-10-17 16:58:59 Nothing confirmed until it’s confirmed. We don’t know anything yet apart from the fact they are talking about fiat/crypto pairs. Unless you know more than the post from Binance earlier?
3033 2018-10-17 16:58:33 @officialmcafee Decentralised exchanges are the future indeed, but they also allow complete freedom to insider trading. Is this not a threat for the volatility and mass adoption towards crypto as a whole?

3037 2018-10-17 16:58:17 Sounds exactly the same as Inmediate.. in that their Telegram group seizes to exist with a real purpose, they’re on like 2 shitty exchanges, raised a lot of money and then crashed hard in price, just running from their investors.. hopefully a bull market will sort these ICOs out!

3063 2018-10-17 16:55:33 Bitcoin will not solve the inflation problem in Venezuela or similar countries. If it ever becomes systemic as a means of payment and commerce the government will simply shut it down and persecute. We need tech that improves the system not naively tries to overthrow it. #crypto
3064 2018-10-17 16:55:26 All crypto is not created equal. If you don't believe FA works in these markets than you can't invest. If you think TA works, then you better be trading swings, TA is a short term momentum indicator.

3100 2018-10-17 16:50:48 Flexible loads are good! With bitcoin it's tougher though,  as mining depends on a high enough price of BTC coinciding with excess electricity. Not really a crypto story.  More of a 'isn't demand management cool' story...

豆知識11：ハードフォーク/ソフトフォークの「フォーク」は「分叉fēnchā」というので、ハード（硬）/ソフト（软）を前につけて、「硬分叉」「软分叉」と呼ばれます。

3338 2018-10-17 16:19:03 having an understanding of the underlying assets you are investing into is pretty much the only way to accurately price things. ESPECIALLY in the crypto space, with no utility, a tokens value can only rise speculatively, as there is no equity correlation with tokens.

3384 2018-10-17 16:14:43 Another DOW prediction. We went up and down too fast. Expect a dip back down within 24/48 hours, 24k-23k. Crypto continues to mirror October 2017. Expect a pump 220+ next week or near it. You can't get good at market calls unless you put it out there for the public to see.
3385 2018-10-17 16:14:41 When it comes to crypto, for a non tech person such as myself, there is a lot of trust placed on the entire development team. I have yet to find a more trustworthy or capable dev team in this space. No rush. No hype. Just solid code.

3425 2018-10-17 16:11:38 DOW drops again after artificial support yesterday. HODL those crypto currencies!! Our time is coming!!
3426 2018-10-17 16:11:24 But $BAT is next on coinbase still cheap
3427 2018-10-17 16:11:15 This guy is a national treasure!
3428 2018-10-17 16:11:08 The issue is less the specific assets and more the assets as a category. Educating on cautions in crypto assets, how to use trading tools/types, and best practices in trading is something we are going to be doing, and feel responsibility to do.
3429 2018-10-17 16:11:08 Take care brother! Hope all is ok.

3432 2018-10-17 16:10:45 Would a conventional pen register record encrypted messaging exchanges? I honestly don’t know.

And one trillion isn't that much in the greater context.
3458 2018-10-17 16:07:40 I would go so far as to suggest that none of these schemes could work at scale (read ‘for society at large’) unless they are explicitly tied to local fiat. As in explicitly pricing services in local fiat and using crypto as the invisible backend.

3533 2018-10-17 16:00:06 I've used crypto for certain purposes. Buy some, then deposit it with an off-shore book, for example. But buying and holding it for investments? You're crazy. It's like speculating in currency futures. George Soros makes a billion dollars. Everyone else goes broke.
