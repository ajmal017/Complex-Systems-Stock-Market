I agree that we don’t usually treat humans as traceable commodities. And my initial tweet was worded poorly (hence my removal) to make it sound like I was discussing that (“redistribution”).

8 2018-05-03 23:30:06 If business can invest $65bn, it will most certainly invest in automation and also qualify for subsequent offsets through depreciation. Assets and labour are both treated as commodities by business. Govt gives only one of them further tax breaks @billshortenmp

13 2018-05-03 22:55:07 No, its a principle Martin.  Education is not a commodity.  The market mechanism should not be coerced into every single corner of life.  The markets and commodities are fine for some parts of society, but to force that logic everywhere is dogmatic and fanatical.

37 2018-05-03 22:20:25 This is exactly right. Raising the question of whether it is ever OK to rape women and/or to treat their bodies as market-commodities is not, how shall we put it, a non-political thought.
38 2018-05-03 22:13:45 These right wing #incel weirdos, who are too uncourteous to find any partner, now demand “redistribution of sex” - yes, like limited available commodities.

41 2018-05-03 22:04:12 Capitalism thrives on  your addiction to its commodities, these commodities include marijuana, cocaine, heroin, meth etc etc
42 2018-05-03 22:02:23 Helen, your thread is an accurate summation the fallacies of Ross’s article. I hope he reads it and gains some insight. Women are tired of being seen as commodities. We’re over it. It’s time for a certain segment of the straight male population to come to terms with that. Period.

47 2018-05-03 21:40:27 This trend of respected news sources entertaining thought experiments where women are sexual commodities to be redistributed or sluts to be punished for having abortions really demonstrates that they don't see us as people in the same sense that men are people.
48 2018-05-03 21:30:52 (3) I stated they are sad sacks. Have you read a happy go lucky post from an incel? Or anything beyond depression/outrage? I also stated they view women as commodities, to which I have no idea if you agree with that or not as you didn't respond to that claim.

50 2018-05-03 21:21:17 I'm sorry but that is the reality. In terms of work and labor you and I are commodities. We are products and our value is dependent on our skills, the need for them and the scarcity of it.

Devalue labor and we become poor, make us rarer and special and our share increases.
51 2018-05-03 21:19:00 People are not raw materials or commodities. They don't sit around in a warehouse somewhere if they don't get used or sell them off in bulk. They die. You cannot apply supply-and-demand rules to people unless you're okay with letting the out-of-demand ones die.
52 2018-05-03 21:16:01 Yes except money is not a real construct: it is ostensibly representative of commodities, which workers of the world create and then have stolen from them by the businessmen that you seem to think are crucial to the production process
53 2018-05-03 21:05:03 It's not about "corrupt individuals". I don't think animal farmers are all ill-intentioned, cruel, sadistic people who love to abuse animals.

54 2018-05-03 21:04:58 I'm a straight cis man and I share absolutely no ideology with incels. The problem (in this instance) isn't cis white men as a whole; the problem is these SPECIFIC cis white men who think of women as commodities they're owed for being such "nice guys".
55 2018-05-03 21:02:59 Tell you something for the square root of zero (pardon the #Chenism) Europe will not know what has hit them when Chen calculates (by comparing cost of multiple items to find singular costs) that fruits, balloons and other culturally integral commodities are cheaper elsewhere.

66 2018-05-03 20:11:36 The tweet, as I recall it, seemed to epitomise the reduction of higher education not just to a purchasable commodity, but to a means to acquire money with which to purchase other commodities, and so to express the neoliberal attitude to higher education with particular clarity.
67 2018-05-03 20:08:34 ...Trust they initiated a trade system. They bought the slaves, with the aid of natives, in exchange for other commodities. So no, the slaves couldn't fight off the masters at this point.
68 2018-05-03 20:00:23 Going back to the point about stable coins, i asked what are they stable in relation to? A basket of commodities, food and rent? The basis of such an index is the basis of bitcoin. It's geopolitically diverse and apolitical. It can be the basis for stable, comparable money
69 2018-05-03 19:56:13 seriously, but their need for psychological treatment should. Making women commodities that are rated and traded like stocks is a primitive enslavement and rape fantasy dressed up in fancy language.

97 2018-05-03 17:42:25 Hanson's follow-up to his suggestion that access to women's bodies be considered for redistribution, on the analogy of income redistribution, is *somewhat* less creepy that his original tweet. Maybe. As a thought exercise only. Assuming everything & everyone are commodities.

102 2018-05-03 17:26:20 I welcome your take on my statement. However I have never said women are commodities. I said "women commodify themselves".

104 2018-05-03 17:10:39 Fine with me if China cuts off our low value chain commodities so they can buy higher value chain products.....
105 2018-05-03 17:09:00 Let me get this straight,your reference to women as commodities=our mothers,sisters & daughters?Yours included?

107 2018-05-03 17:04:25 Western economies would suffer more than Africa,commodities markets would rally,base metals in particular would result in acute inflationary pressures in Western economies.Their productivity would drop resulting in a sizeable drop in their fx rate relative to African currencies.
108 2018-05-03 17:01:37 Because there are no women lining up to volunteer now are there? No, that’s 99% because it’s wrong, and 1% because this is a discussion about men, for men, mostly by men, that discusses women as commodities to be redistributed.
109 2018-05-03 16:59:03 So... you agree that women are commodities?
110 2018-05-03 16:55:43 There are some product categories that will be resistant to that, particularly tactile items like guitars among more experienced buyers. Some things are commodities. Others are not.
111 2018-05-03 16:51:57 silver lining is that the basic rules about supply and demand and global markets and commodities actually apply to soybeans because they're an actual commodity. So China will get beans elsewhere & the places elsewhere normally sold to can replace elsewhere's scarcer beans w/ours
112 2018-05-03 16:49:26 Commodities available vastly in excess of demand or beyond marginal utility shed value and become expendable.
113 2018-05-03 16:44:14 Picture this. Oil prices dropped globally. Domestically it's increasing weekly. The economy is down. Money is not circulating. High pricing of commodities.  CBK is about to lift capping of rates. Someone is doing well & it's not the consumer!!! Recession
114 2018-05-03 16:37:47 Most escaped slaves traveled most of the distance 2 freedom by foot. Horses need rest, water, food, shoes, commodities that weren't always accessible on the run.

115 2018-05-03 16:35:57 Perfectly I know, essential commodities were very cheap, but now, only elites can afford two square meal a day. What a betrayal of change.
116 2018-05-03 16:33:48 But FIRST, comes the commodities cycle. Trust your knowledge of the market and the data in front of you. News turns your brain to mush.
117 2018-05-03 16:32:00 Plenty of FS businesses treat clients like commodities. Also, plenty who don't.
118 2018-05-03 16:29:39 @arunjaitley sir namaste. Bring petrol & diesel under GST as it has cascading effect on essential commodities. So also, we urge you not impose any Cess on sugar tomorrow in 27th GST Council meeting. # President, Samajwadi Party, Odisha.

121 2018-05-03 16:18:49 I am going to have to stuff this commodities cycle idea down your throat in order to drill it into your head. I'll be gentle.

123 2018-05-03 16:16:39 I guess I’ll head for a teeth cleaning and walk out without paying after. I mean, services aren’t commodities. You can’t steal a service. Lets word game around this so we don’t admit we think rape is just theft! Yay liberalism.
124 2018-05-03 16:10:49 She just completely changed the goalposts with her answer. Not only ARE services commodities, but you never said prostituted women are the commodities. You asked if sex is, since it is a “service” they provide. And she avoided the question.

126 2018-05-03 16:00:43 "Marginal Utility does not apply to refugee commodities (i.e. gold)"
...

So an additional unit of gold would go on to serve a HIGHER ranked want than the units I already have?

Or: if I had to lose 1 unit of gold, I would choose to lose satisfaction a NON-least of my wants?

131 2018-05-03 15:48:00 These people hate women and view women as commodities, not human beings. Truly sick. And dangerous.
132 2018-05-03 15:44:25 They will come to North and be misleading people. Goods/Containers from Lagos to North where is dia route........same Lagos-Ibadan Rd.  Food, livestocks and other commodities from North to Lagos pass through dis road also. Lagos kill more than 6k Cow everyday....all from North.
133 2018-05-03 15:42:01 Because of greed and people being commodities, it's like slavery over again and people cannot afford descent lawyers. Disgusting.
134 2018-05-03 15:41:44 No! I won’t stop! Everything is not about diversity! We are not commodities to be exploited because you want quotas met! Let’s get real and focus on the gospel!!

136 2018-05-03 15:33:40 IMO, if this sell off in stocks really gets going, or should I say WHEN, I believe commodities-especially Silver & Gold, as well as Cryptocurrencies will vault, VAULT, higher.

147 2018-05-03 14:57:57 You're wrong. I was referring to price manipulation, but I was not comparing it to commodities such oil or copper.
148 2018-05-03 14:57:09 My comment wasn't meant to compare the manipulation potential of Bitcoin to say commodities such as oil or copper, but I'm happy to have that conversation should you desire.
149 2018-05-03 14:56:10 But let's dig deeper. You seem to be comparing Bitcoin to commodities. Ok. Compared to gold, Bitcoin is much harder to manipulate over any longer-term periods. Compared to oil, let's say, I agree with your statement.

164 2018-05-03 14:22:54 our food system is totally fucked up.  its about time we saw prices that reflect the true cost of growing/manufacturing our food.  i believe we NEED higher food prices and better government subsidies of actual whoie foods and not commodities like corn and soy.

219 2018-05-03 10:36:42 Ask the Woloff, Ashanti, and Ibo (among others); they were once the main commodities in the global economy, distributed widely; no quotas or tariffs, fueled ship building and agriculture.
220 2018-05-03 10:20:47 Most currencies have been based on physical commodities, particularly gold. By contrast fiat money is ultimately based upon enough people having faith that a given currency will be accepted.

233 2018-05-03 08:22:39 Superb rant my friend. 

However I believe Bitcoin's value against commodities will actually increase gradually over time due to its asymptotically decreasing supply rate.

280 2018-05-03 04:59:38 @SushilModi Sushilji, the @GST_Council should consider making the GST on branded basic commodities like wheat-flour uniform to unbranded ones. Consumers deserve to get branded & trustworthy wheat products at level-playing taxing systems.
281 2018-05-03 04:54:18 Historically gold and silver are the best stores of value. The financial industry,
