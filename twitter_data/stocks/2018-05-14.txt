2 2018-05-14 23:58:25 Seriously, HoggBoy, are you now trying to take credit for the the wishes of the vast majority of Americans, including most responsible gun owners, who were already in favor of banning bump stocks?
3 2018-05-14 23:56:15 Lol, let me explain. I don’t play stocks for small profits. I’d rather take a small loss on a new trade, than sell it at new highs for a small gain.
4 2018-05-14 23:51:23 Well clearly it's not meant to be Earned Income. But so is an inheritance or a lottery win. Or "earning" dividends from owning stocks.  Or profiting from the exploitation of underpaid labour. The UBI is meant to claw back some of that unearned profit

8 2018-05-14 23:48:39 Not for me ... I see no such thing .. most OTC stocks to become current with filing standards end up diluting their stock and performing a RS .. until news hits my news feed on my TD trading platform I will do what I do best .. trade this with opportunistic play
9 2018-05-14 23:47:26 Hey JJ, before you NRA bathed clunkhead got involved, our conversations were about bump stocks. It’s been so twisted and warped now that it no longer matters.

13 2018-05-14 23:45:58 Not all brokers allow you to buy all stocks unfortunately bud. E trade tends to get the most but even with them I've gotten messages like that. The last resort is calling them and seeing if they'll do it on the phone.

56 2018-05-14 23:14:08 Not much, banning bump stocks. But it's a start.
57 2018-05-14 23:12:50 Stocks went up again today  2019 will be nothing but up speakin it to existence now
58 2018-05-14 23:12:23 We’re working on a blog post for this week. It will be touching on dollar cost averaging and the value of allocating a safe amount of your monthly income into stocks. Strategies and insight that will help grow your investing portfolio!
59 2018-05-14 23:11:10 stocks took a hit today.
60 2018-05-14 23:10:58 Young people aren’t banning these things. I’m completely pro-gun and still think bump stocks should be regulated heavily. Teens aren’t on these political boards making votes to ban things
61 2018-05-14 23:10:31 Super, merci pour cet état des stocks. :) Super intéressant et le dessin est mignon comme toujours !
62 2018-05-14 23:08:25 IQ no compre en su momento y no ha parado de subir. Habrá que ver si tiene más recorrido.

65 2018-05-14 23:05:00 Cool style and text mate! Maybe work on adding some stocks or just more detail in general 
66 2018-05-14 23:04:37 Evening Market Wrap-up: stocks close off highs of day finding upper resistance.
67 2018-05-14 23:03:25 $SPY Back to a mixed assortment of stocks in various cycles and more reason to be selective here. Patience on setups and don't chase.
68 2018-05-14 23:03:21 No need to be sorry, I like seeing your take on stocks
69 2018-05-14 23:03:16 Nope I believe in the Company... Just dig a hole and bash another stock. Leave the guys like myself to help promote the stocks we invest in. I will laugh at ya to the bank while you are working at McDonalds
70 2018-05-14 23:02:02 Deep breaths between stocks maybe
71 2018-05-14 23:01:31 It's a good question to get to stocks I'd be interested in. What do you buy if you want to own FANG but are prohibited from it?
72 2018-05-14 23:00:24 Stocks take the stairs on the way up and the elevator on the way down ... I like the recovery, in my humble opinion you can trust the rally $SPY $DIA $QQQ
73 2018-05-14 22:58:55 The lack of knowledge shows the ignorance bump stocks actually save lives in Vegas by causing the weapon to foul and jam up
74 2018-05-14 22:57:09 Trading stocks and assets generally requires far better performance than blockchains (even with sidecars) can deliver. Trading markets without trusted parties are a niche; value fluctuation's ok for some niches like politically incorrect research chemicals with high margins.
75 2018-05-14 22:56:10 I know in investment accounts, you can specify that you don't want your money invested in certain things (i.e. no tobacco stocks). do you think you would add a contract clause to not allow your technology for what some might consider foul play?
76 2018-05-14 22:56:08 My life consists of sports, stocks and whatever fun I can get into on the weekends. No break lol.

79 2018-05-14 22:55:27 They should be in school where they are sa... wait they are not safe in school either because anyone can get an asault rifle and enough ammo and extended mads and bump stocks to take out a school so what's your point again?
80 2018-05-14 22:55:19 Uh-Oh. Citi analysts conclude: "There isn’t enough money to pay 22c in FY19 & FY20". Telstra $TLS needs drastic action, they say. Sell. Target drops to $2.70 #ausbiz #XJO #investing #stocks #equities #dogsaredogsaredogs
81 2018-05-14 22:54:51 It is unimaginable that EVERY republican accepts and condones this type of BS. Not one of them speaks out against the illegality of all of this. Are you all getting kickbacks?  Inside information for stocks? You have abandoned OUR country-shame on you!!
82 2018-05-14 22:53:27 How do you figure he's afraid of the NRA?  He supports them.  He's against bump stocks which is something they want.  He hasn't changed on that position that I know of. You think because he supports them he's afraid of them?
83 2018-05-14 22:51:26 Instead of buying stocks we could discuss what teams to bet 
84 2018-05-14 22:51:24 I noticed though that Fri, all the FAANG and most momentum stocks closed red. which was either early warning or first sign of rotation. We'll see!
85 2018-05-14 22:50:15 The worst part about it is: While people die of starvation, need a home or even a job they sell their stocks to China instead of investing in America. He's a corporate pig that doesn't deserve the money he has.
86 2018-05-14 22:49:43 @DougKass You’ve stated your views on the marijuana industry and stocks recently, do you share a similar view of today’s Supreme Court ruling in favor of sports gambling? Or are you more sanguine?
87 2018-05-14 22:49:21 1) I see a lot of people in the #Crypto community who rave about #Bitcoin for only one reason- scarcity (21 million supply cap). But it's important to understand that inflation has its benefits. Inflation incentivizes us to invest in productive assets like real estate and stocks
88 2018-05-14 22:48:41 Ordered. Thanks Tim. We are developing swing trading strategy for penny stocks for small accounts with my friend.
89 2018-05-14 22:47:24 all you would need to know how to do then is manipulate penny stocks like certain someones did.

99 2018-05-14 22:39:18 A gauge of stocks around the world rose to its highest point in about two months on Monday amid improving trade relations between the US and China. Aussie shares are also set to open firmer today as Wall St extended its rally. #DailyMarketUpdate #ausbiz

105 2018-05-14 22:30:07 @ScotShewman William Hill and CD stocks soared today in the news of legal sports betting. I am sure the Windsor casino will now stay closed. 2 team parlays, give me a damn break
106 2018-05-14 22:29:26 But wages are flat and companies used your Tax gift to buy back stocks, just like they said they would.

109 2018-05-14 22:25:31 What most investors fail to understand is that Stocks & Equities  valued in $'s £'s €'s etc are in fact measuring forward looking performance against a #DEBT INSTRUMENT, while #Bitcoin is in fact the complete mirror opposite.

116 2018-05-14 22:18:41 $poe was the project that allowed blockchain to "click" for me. That said can you blame people after they saw 2017? A lot of money see crypto as a volatile alternative to stocks so with most risk they want rewards faster. With no standard way to evaluate projects and no guarantee

119 2018-05-14 22:14:42 I'm always honest about my positions. If you can't handle someone criticizing the stocks you own, you are either a) lazy or b) trying to take advantage of other people (common w/ Twitter and Jr Mining scams).
120 2018-05-14 22:14:37 You are right ! Just check Tesla stock!! Is media coverage influencing Tesla stocks? I’m personal admirer of you! Thanks for all the technology!
121 2018-05-14 22:13:41 Upon further reflection, Bell Potter has upgraded Macquarie Group $MQG to Buy from Hold, while price target moves to $125 from $116.50, finds guidance ultra-conservative #ausbiz #XJO #investing #stocks #equities
122 2018-05-14 22:12:36 I don't want any Americans rights infringed upon at the same time, trying to limit the amount of people someone could kill in such a short amount of time. It is like trying to walk a tightrope. I think I am totally against bump stocks too, i don't see the need. In any case 
123 2018-05-14 22:10:28 Elders $ELD missed expectations @Bell_Potter, downgraded to Sell from Hold, price target lifts to $6.95 from $6.80, says underlying the business has weakened while share price went up #ausbiz #XJO #investing #stocks #equities

No assault rifles or bump stocks. Legal age 21 for gun purchase. Funding gun safety research so even profound morons know truth.

127 2018-05-14 22:05:37 He also should have told them to try and have republicans write in a line item to exempt them from taxes when they bring back money from overseas so they can buy back stocks and a then a fake president can brag about it misleadingly.
128 2018-05-14 22:04:28 Pumping #Semi stocks @petenajarian @jonnajarian @jimcramer @CNBCFastMoney Big call buying in $AMD $MU also $MRVL running at 3x average volume. Larger than normal call buying. $SMH $NXPI $QCOM $NVDA should be an interesting day tomorrow and week for Semi conductor stocks.

139 2018-05-14 21:58:34 Not necessarily. Vegas is still Vegas. And gaming company stocks closed up today, except for LV Sands. Most large gaming companies have property holdings outside of Nevada. If they bring out-of-state profits home to Nevada, I'm okay with the Court's ruling.

I was heavily pregnant on my second child and visiting a hardware store with the three and a half year old, looking for new kitchen chairs. You know, the usual type of big hangar building that stocks everything from bark mulch to paint to nuts n bolts to kitchen sinks.
141 2018-05-14 21:55:46 I think it's a pretty level playing field now. Stocks go parabolic. They get shorted. Checks and balances. The only chance I think is that it may result in is investors that don't know enough about shorting having a say. Last thing we want is MPs touching it. Lol

145 2018-05-14 21:49:20 Most people assume that net worth equals the actual money in a bank account.  Most of the net worth of rich people is in stocks of their company. 

So if Amazon keeps growing of course Jeff Bezos keeps gaining more net worth.

And why should he cash out?

150 2018-05-14 21:43:22 That’s fine @SpeakerRyan but instead of trying to polish a badly corroded epitaph, why don’t you save some lives by working toward common sense gun laws, background checks, ban bump stocks, anything that will save lives!

179 2018-05-14 21:20:39 He's young & has huge potential upside but let's be honest, he's done very little to this point in his career to be demanding top coin. The leverage he has though is that the CFC recruiters have so mismanaged our key position stocks that he can pretty much demand what he wants.

319 2018-05-14 19:58:43 Want to ban bump stocks? I don’t care, go ahead. But too much time is being wasted on this issue, grandstanding. Bump stocks may be a high profile, polarizing issue that inflames passions. But has little to do with core needs in Cincinnati. Focus on improving quality of life.
320 2018-05-14 19:58:21 I think you could create an entire market around trading futures wagers like stocks. You could sell that $10 Vegas Knights preseason 500/1 bet for a couple thousand right now, but it's dropping.

I'm assuming you are a good guy who is trained in gun use & safety so why would you have any issue with reasnble laws like extnded waiting period,  being 21 to buy a gun or limiting magazine size or required training or banning bump stocks?

336 2018-05-14 19:49:02 I don't understand how anyone can be in support of bump stocks.  Exactly how are they going to help a well regulated militia?  They're just intended to maximize damage where "everyone else" is the "enemy."  Militia should aim carefully at the redcoats, not wildly at everyone.
337 2018-05-14 19:48:27 I didn't say they sold you stocks. I said some stocks on Wall Street aren't really stocks at all. Does that knowledge upset you? Now what if I told you the Lakers/Kings WCF was definitively fixed. You had no money on line in either case, do you care the same?

Right before internet bubble burst, internet stocks equaled 6% of the GDP... Today, cryptocurrency equals only 0.8% of GDP.

Got a long ways to go to say that crypto is at the point internet stocks were when the bubble burst!

1) growth - companies take what they would give back in dividends and REINVEST in the company. This allows the firm to (hopefully) generate more CASH in the future

2) value stocks - firms that pay out dividends (CASH)

604 2018-05-14 17:17:14 My last count shows that in average 60% of the stocks are going up and 40% are in distribution phase. In healthy markets that number is higher around 75% or more.

630 2018-05-14 17:06:43 This is why I love stocks from $6.00-$12.00 sometimes they could bounce one dollar.
631 2018-05-14 17:06:41 Does this mean stocks are about to tumble?
632 2018-05-14 17:06:31 I think the 10yr crossed in January, if I'm not mistaken. Some in the market revisited equity vs bonds on this metric, the general gist being that bonds were going to gain on rotation from stocks. If only it were so simple. These "indicators"are by-products of other strategies

636 2018-05-14 17:04:24 Very true. So can we say that most large cap stocks are highly liquid? As there is low price volatility. And mid / small cap stocks are less liquid given they there is more risk of price going down. So those who have all savings in equity, should focus on large cap only?

652 2018-05-14 16:59:46 Here's the thing about the financial market. When times are tough, the banks win. When times are good, the banks win. If you're looking to be more conservative, more towards bonds. Lower returns however, than stocks. Go with low maintenance costs, however.
653 2018-05-14 16:58:17 @dandakich isn’t buying stocks in the stock market a form of educated gambling?  I say bring it on as long as it’s properly regulated. With the accessibility of online gambling/apps people who want to do it are going to find a way. Keep the money/taxes in state.
654 2018-05-14 16:55:54 Hi manas, I suggest that in 2nd session of the webinar, u also explain these loss trades. Radico is a very good example, but other such stocks would give very good practical insights on ur sl techniqies and risk managememt.
655 2018-05-14 16:55:14 Correct... there are many facts missing but most reports focus on his use of the reviled bump stocks which allowed him to increase his rate of fire.
If he would have fired solely in semi-auto, with aimed shots, he would have killed far more.

658 2018-05-14 16:52:55 The other big thing everyone is missing we will see a very large infrastructure bill favoring companies not government before the midterms. This will help just like the tax cuts. Now is time to buy infrastructure stocks
659 2018-05-14 16:52:02 I agree that the vast majority will lose over time, but some people will be able to win long run for the simple reason that betting is a market. So in the same way the stocks get oversold and overbought and divorced from their fundamentals, so will sports teams and betting lines.

664 2018-05-14 16:49:36 Ya know, along the lines of Matthew 25:14-30. Like 16:1-13. I try as much as possible to make every red cent of mine work for me-even when I buy something I want money for the purchase. I invest. Crypto, stocks, real estate.

690 2018-05-14 16:35:31 $AUPH Congrats to fellow shareholders for holding this name through thick and thin. Nearly a 20% move in 2 days, just goes to show why you need to identify cheap stocks, and OWN them. Trying to time an entry in deep value stocks is a fools game. Next stop, double digits!

711 2018-05-14 16:27:36 Stocks traded higher on Monday amid hopes of a potential breakthrough in trade tensions between the U.S. and China, the world's two largest economies.

717 2018-05-14 16:25:22 Ok, what backing does it have? What information is there that this coin is going somewhere? In stocks, when there is a burn/split, it's usually because the company is frantically trying to keep its head above water, or at least their profits.

787 2018-05-14 15:50:18 The strongest stocks start trending up because investment managers are building/increasing a position in the stock. This buying demand drives the stock higher as it takes time for large investors to accumulate a position. Then, others who underreacted start following the trend.

821 2018-05-14 15:33:25 I used to think I was a value investor but have learned over time that I am more of a GARP guy. I have also made more absolute dollars in growth stocks (Biotech, Tech). Have tended to move away from dividend yields too. E.g. would prefer TAP over GIS despite lower yield.

Then FURU will use that to EXIT his SIZE and gloat about how EASY trading is with his strategy

966 2018-05-14 14:28:58 There are a number of issues here but feels that CC is seen as the culprit. 

As @evestoranthony implies, if the cost of implementation is factored in, does THAT not introduce conflict of interest? Likewise % based OAC (and desire to build AUM).

All conflicts must be managed.
967 2018-05-14 14:28:48 The reason I’m not worried about rising rates and oil prices is because stocks keep moving higher. I’ll worry about rising rates and oil prices when stocks stop moving higher.
968 2018-05-14 14:28:28 This is terrible for holders!! One of the quickest diluting stocks of 2018, with no proof of demand that aligns with these decisions. Only hope of any return in the next year or more is Aurora gets bought out.

1054 2018-05-14 13:49:23 @RobinhoodApp fans be advised - if holding call options until expiry, Robinhood will only let you exercise if you have enough buying power to actually buy the stocks. If exercising the option, RH won't net out payments, you'll actually get stock in your account.

1077 2018-05-14 13:39:46 I do agree it was over the top and past good taste. I'm just also bothered by the idea that we have to drag everyone out into the public stocks over an unfortunate comment, and I also see the point that the senator has been saying some pretty bitter and hurtful things, himself.

1092 2018-05-14 13:28:47 4/5 stocks holding up nifty with declines vastly outnumbering gains(deteriorating AD every single day) is called a bull market?

1094 2018-05-14 13:27:56 Sessions the Attorney General @jeffsessions has private prison stocks. Who would have thunk it?
1095 2018-05-14 13:27:45 Disagree. SEK depreciation of 15% has led to Riksbank closing in on its target. They could have engineered a stronger depreciation with more resolve, would have worked. Buy stocks, buy foreign bonds, transfer 10K to very household, if you do enough CB can create inflation.
1096 2018-05-14 13:26:56 I'm thinking that now would be a great time to invest in stocks that sell handcuffs!

1151 2018-05-14 12:55:52 One great selling point of equity is it's liquidity... u can cash out in t+2 days

Hence, it's imp that at least 40% of portfolio shd be saleable in 1 day (with minimal price damage)

This is esp critical for anyone who has all their savings in stocks.

1319 2018-05-14 10:32:47 Nice article but:

- Doesn't account for the vast supply of staked ETH

"If you want to invest in the US economy, you should buy stocks in U.S. companies, not hold US dollars."

- The utility of ETH is vastly different than the US dollar. It's more akin to digital real estate.

1406 2018-05-14 09:04:38 As have I Justin, and there will always be a place for big income paying stocks in my Portfolio. I've seen many people lose the lot on Aim over the last 20 years. Overconfidence is often their undoing. The casino will always be predominantly for punts only.
1407 2018-05-14 09:02:59 Btw - Unless a person has no time, I would advise then no stock is a buy and hold. One should always re-evaluate on every bit of significant news released. You can get hammered in big stocks and they don't present a great amount of upside too.
1408 2018-05-14 09:02:15 I think this is what's driving it higher now. Fake earnings. Most YTD data globally is poor & was the reason for moves  to YTD lows while hope/hype continually overrides data to run US stocks higher. Volume isn't convincing but direction is. Stretching for reasons to btfd rules.

1563 2018-05-14 06:31:14 Some what accurate. Money in stocks goes to the company only when they are the ones saleing. After that sale the money goes to stock holder. Even after investment is paid off dividends are still required. Yes banks use your money to profit from investment. It protects theirs.

1571 2018-05-14 06:26:45 Yes, but the money in stocks pays for a company to grow, a value that is returned to the stockholders.  It's the central banks that forced ordinary Americans into the risk of the stock market because they can't earn interest from banks.  Wealth is mainly purchasing power.

1730 2018-05-14 03:41:47 Unfortunately, this which "becomes bad results" because I'm poor at your investment in stocks, is true. When thinking it was buying, the stock price falls, so I think I stick to a strange sense.

2 - OVERSOLD STOCKS WITHIN A STAGE 2 UPTREND.
3 - BASES BREAKOUTS WITHIN A STAGE 2 UPTREND.
4 - STOCKS WHICH CONSOLIDATE AFTER A GAP UP AND RUN.

1876 2018-05-14 01:23:58 Markets have been propped up by a small number of Tech Stocks... as a retail investor I'm more than happy to wait this one out.
1877 2018-05-14 01:23:04 Making dog fighting illegal was for virtue signalling whores.
Banning "something that kills the most during the time of its legality" = pit bulls / bump stocks.
Muhammad (poison be upon him) still had the right idea: all mutts should be discarded, but also eaten, you retards.
1878 2018-05-14 01:21:42 Great. I think we can all agree that bump stocks aren't necessary.

1885 2018-05-14 01:12:53 But new stocks and new sectors keep emerging to replace older ones. That's the beauty of a high growth economy.

1887 2018-05-14 01:11:44 Even though some municipal authorities had stocks of stable iodine, they were not distributed.
1888 2018-05-14 01:10:06 Yes that case gonna be very important for both these stocks.
1889 2018-05-14 01:09:00 just a question... on your math, $200 profit on $1000 spent is 20% profit. Here's the question. Where on earth can you get 20% on your money in a cpl days? Not a bank and not stocks (generally speaking)
1890 2018-05-14 01:08:19 They just don't get it. They play it like stocks and it's not that at all. This isn't poker, it's about true wealth.
1891 2018-05-14 01:07:07 And I don't mean that as a slight....it's just that I've been taught that penny stocks are penny stocks for a reason.
1892 2018-05-14 01:05:55 Than why the big push to off-load players (other than poor performance)? Are our stocks so bad in the juniors that we cant blood a few noobs next yr? i know its not ideal, but if we punt current players, that not only effects us in 2019, but beyond as well
1893 2018-05-14 01:05:30 Marcus is a dryad who trades stocks on the weekends.
1894 2018-05-14 01:04:14 Why do you focus on penny stocks, when they seem to be the most easily manipulated?
1895 2018-05-14 01:03:39 As we all watch casket and funeral homes stocks soar....
1896 2018-05-14 01:03:30 ya MCM put “crypto investor” in his bio but all his stocks plummeted overnight
1897 2018-05-14 01:00:39 And also i invest into stocks as well and I'm not rich you don't have to be rich to invest you just have to understand what and how to invest
1898 2018-05-14 00:59:46 Where’s the argument?? Unless other people are arguing with you and not tagging me ?
1899 2018-05-14 00:58:05 $TSLA bears/shorts obviously do not read charts otherwise they would be trembling in fear
sometimes i wonder how come idiots get to run billions of dollars  OPM
it's a weird weird world
hard working people get nothing while total suckers waste billions OPM

1900 2018-05-14 00:57:42 Every time I read his excellent research I am convinced we must crash.  And then the S&P futures are always higher.  I think the government might be buying futures and stocks.
1901 2018-05-14 00:57:00 The things I've seen say they're more mechanically accurate than many give them credit for being--minute of man out to several hundred yards, anyway. I was looking to buy one, but the stocks are so short without after-market parts that it didn't feel good in my hands.
1902 2018-05-14 00:55:56 I think pharma stocks are the safest investment..with CAGR of 21 percent for next 3 years...
1903 2018-05-14 00:55:31 Stocks went up for drug makers on Friday after Blotus belched out his latest non-policy. I guess the 1.2 million Novartis paid Cohen came in handy afterall. #TrumpCrimeSyndicate
1904 2018-05-14 00:54:58 Yes I did, because even bad publicity is better than no publicity, our stocks are currently rising exponentially.
1905 2018-05-14 00:53:42 I never said we weren't. It would make the game more aggro is all. I don't see anything wrong with that. At least people would have to think on when to use their air dodges and rolls. Makes the ledge less forgiving. 3 stocks would be a thing under this kind of meta
1906 2018-05-14 00:51:08 Good morning KLSE!

1907 2018-05-14 00:49:23 Time to  give  a PT Barnum  salute to the Najarian Bros. Jon and Pete use CNBC as their personal daily infomercial and get CNBC to pay them. Everyday they promote UOA on stocks they've already taken a position in. LOL. No accountability as to what they paid or when they sell.
1908 2018-05-14 00:47:58 I was gonna buy some bank stocks too,  but then I got high
1909 2018-05-14 00:44:42 We on different levels as people your thinking fun I'm thinking stocks and bonds
1910 2018-05-14 00:44:02 I guess no ones arguing that crypto is less than forex or stocks. That’s good at least. 
1911 2018-05-14 00:42:46 No stocks taken from me
1912 2018-05-14 00:40:56 Is trumps zte a catalyst for a rippy day tomorrow in big China stocks e.g. baba, bidu
1913 2018-05-14 00:37:33 You caught it in the midst of buy out rumors. That is an anamoly....most stocks don’t go through that 
1914 2018-05-14 00:37:14 I see good stocks that go down as just being on sale. Good attitude or...?
1915 2018-05-14 00:36:37 Anyone else think @zerohedge and @MishGEA are going to provide reasons the market should correct as it makes its way to new all time highs?

1935 2018-05-14 00:09:35 Would probably get better return in starting a venture capital fund or investing in stocks like Apple, Amazon, Norwegian Pension Funds,etc but noooo how will they eat. Already market has oversupply of offices in fact they can dictate terms. Same ppl same thinking

Stocks are up because of Trump’s pro-business stance.
The debt has already decreased. It is lower than predicted for April.
1939 2018-05-14 00:05:24 British stocks fared better than their continental counterparts as @ITV surged 7.3% after the broadcaster posted a 5% increase in revenue for the first quarter.
1940 2018-05-14 00:05:23 I believe that bump stocks should be banned.  After all they're a scam.  Anyone can easily make their semi automatic an automatic.  Yet, I believe that those "Big, Scary, and tactical" guns don't need to be banned.  They're vital for ensuring security.
1941 2018-05-14 00:05:11 European stocks closed slightly lower on Friday after eking out earlier gains. Drug maker @sanofi dropped 3.6%, construction giants @LafargeHolcim sank 3.3% and HeidelbergCement slumped 1.4%, while hotelier @Accorhotels lost 1.9%.

1944 2018-05-14 00:03:37 Your plan is so weak and spineless that drug company stocks rose after it was announced. What does that tell you?
