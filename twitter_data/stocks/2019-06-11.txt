2 2019-06-11 23:59:04 I’ve had my finger on the trigger to short bonds the last few days, 30’s and ultra’s. Actually sold once but scratched it. Today was a big technical reversal on both charts, they look poised to make a run at the highs. Peripherally bearish on stocks, is why I mention it here.

5 2019-06-11 23:57:00 Well what reason do they have to raise rates? 

Even if there’s a delay in fed rate hikes, you’ll see the same result as you would with a fed rate cut. Stocks go up when fed rates go down and vice versa. 

Plus the market is severely over sold since Q4 2018.

8 2019-06-11 23:52:04 The ONLY thing you know about the value of a dollar is how your tariffs allow you to short stocks.
9 2019-06-11 23:51:58 Yes, how does the market go from the Fed will raise rates to the Fed will cut rates in two months? Market thinks the Fed will cut rates, so stocks rise.

16 2019-06-11 23:46:56 I answered the discount brokerage's customer survey "Why don't you use a mobile 'app' to trade stocks?" question with "Revelation 13:16-17," which isn't exactly true but is more interesting than just "That is not something I have any reason to ever want to do."
