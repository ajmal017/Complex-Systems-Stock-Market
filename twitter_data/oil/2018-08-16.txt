12 2018-08-16 23:57:46 I don't know man, seems legit to me.  A year ago everything out of the Niagara GH was priced at $6 and their oil mix is up over the period.  But I get the feeling your mind is made up so I will leave it alone.
13 2018-08-16 23:57:39 That’s my point. He hammers the oil and gas sector and ignores Quebec do this.

40 2018-08-16 23:56:39 Whos going to pay for the radiation pollution /storage from hydro production????  People using gas/oil need a rebate. Not the clowns driving a battery causing lithium fires.
41 2018-08-16 23:56:38 Yeah, wish I was in Miami. It's probably gonna be about 85 degrees w/ a nice breeze off the Atlantic. Fall up in there w/ a Peach(Those Bright Colors Go Great w/ My Business) linen short set..Twist all CoCo Butter Oil up.. Bottom Grill Sparkling.
42 2018-08-16 23:56:20 The saudis are an oil superpower. Do you think they have the highest petrol prices in the world? Look after number one.
43 2018-08-16 23:56:19 That is the best compliment, thank you! It was also a recreation of painting (I think oil) by Dustin bailard!
44 2018-08-16 23:56:13 Ooooo, can you feel them getting closer?     Maybe diffusing some Lavender oil will help with the anxiety.
45 2018-08-16 23:56:03 why the fuck does olive oil burn my throat like vape
46 2018-08-16 23:55:40 I totally support Mr president for his actions against turkey what people don’t know that turkey and Qatar support ISIS because they are the only two countries besides Iran who support the Muslim brotherhood terrorist Group turkey used to buy their oil from isis
47 2018-08-16 23:55:25 *goes to dealership to get car serviced* 

Me: yeah, I need a new battery and my oil changed.

Them: did you say you want to trade your car in for a new one? 

Me: No.

Them: okay then. That oil change and battery will be $193738102048

48 2018-08-16 23:55:04 The existence of private property in land, links between FIRE, police & cities/planners/politicians, artificial scarcity & abundance, support for rent extraction (from cars to oil to housing to finance to IP to fossil fuels) are incredibly destructive & toxic.
49 2018-08-16 23:55:04 I would rather consume a teaspoon of seaman than two teaspoons of coconut oil alone.

51 2018-08-16 23:54:29 Not to mention the flat out actual material & quality difference btwn synthesised patented product and oil made from natural plant alone. And the research showing synthesised prod has outcome issues.
52 2018-08-16 23:54:24 Maybe, but it would help if they talked about things like universal healthcare during the campaign instead of soliciting donations from oil super pacs.
53 2018-08-16 23:54:07 While most bitches wanna use cologne or perfume I just like using jasmine oil 
54 2018-08-16 23:54:05 My version of financial freedom is being able to do my oil change more often than the manufacturer recommends
55 2018-08-16 23:53:58 Car gets hit at work, gets a bolt in tire, fragments of the bolt are broken inside the tire, fender liner ripped off while driving, 2k over my due oil change, and my axle is still clinking. The car gods basically said “fuck your car”.

61 2018-08-16 23:53:33 Personally I've bn blacklisted 4 my efforts 4 legalisation here in Aust. Th activists & black market producers who kept ppl alive have bn targeted & blacklisted. I'm facing 18yrs for supplying free cannabis oil to ppl that were sick and dying. No place in the legal industry 4 me
62 2018-08-16 23:53:31 Just showing up is enough.
63 2018-08-16 23:53:22 93% of exports were oil and the government spent all the money it earned on non wealth producing things. When oil prices hit, and when the government took over farmland and was unable to manage it, they couldn't get food.
64 2018-08-16 23:52:58 Anyone in the UK who deals with #Trichtillomania?

My natural hair oil blend has been given the go ahead to begin the focus group testing phase.

76 2018-08-16 23:51:14 He has zero respect for our @POTUS, tainting his own career by voicing treasonous statements, siding with our enemies. He was mastermind of the 2013 Ukraine Coup, where Biden & Kerry sacked oil companies, gold reserves went missing and Putin was given Crimea and Syria.

92 2018-08-16 23:47:13 Here is the delima.  If KSA had Canadian values (i.e. playing dress up and preaching feminism) they would never have held on to power in this part of the world.  Radicals would control the largest oil reserve the world relies on and who's military would get involved.
93 2018-08-16 23:47:08 Puro cuento, los venezolanos de a pie no sabemos q pasará, si nos venderán gas oil, Ono, q calamidad, hasta cuándo tendremos las esperanza, paisano
94 2018-08-16 23:46:43 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
95 2018-08-16 23:46:41 Bad translations are my favorite. A fondue restaurant here in Paris used to translate their goat cheese fondue into English using the phrase "balls of goat in boiling oil." I was so sad when they finally changed it. Someone must have clued them in.....
96 2018-08-16 23:46:24 It's supposed to prove that you were wrong to suggest that the 1996 Liberal budget measure was about "other industries". It was targeted at the oil sands and to head off complaints from other surface extractive industries, they were included.
97 2018-08-16 23:46:15 “Last time I did olive oil, I gagged” lol ok
98 2018-08-16 23:46:09 Well that too. But also, like 10 years ago, Assad switched their foreign transactions from dollars to Euros. Gaddafi was threatening to trade oil in Euros. Iran wanted to trade oil with China in RMB a few years back.

102 2018-08-16 23:45:35 I'm doing an article that will serve as the hub for the Popeye for Smash campaign that goes into the history of Popeye and Nintendo. How Donkey Kong was originally going to be Bluto, Mario was going to be Popeye, and Pauline was going to be Olive Oil. Well maybe. It's not clear.

110 2018-08-16 23:44:31 Of course! Leaks oil all the time...it’s a “fun” trait of the car

116 2018-08-16 23:43:05 Do you know anything about Canada’s economy?
We sit on the 3 largest oil reserve... I think we’ll be fine
Good luck growing grains in your climate 
117 2018-08-16 23:42:46 The land that your sustainable crops of palm oil is growing on was once most likely the habitatOf endangered animals
118 2018-08-16 23:42:45 Time to get rid of NAFTA and make deals with other countries.  the US needs us more than we need them.  We need to become less dependant on US.  They take most of our oil and half our gas we pay high prices.
119 2018-08-16 23:42:30 The best way is to drive an EV. No need to burn food or oil. :-D
120 2018-08-16 23:42:24 I check every time to make sure palm oil isn’t an ingredient. If people knew what cost their Nutella came at, they’d be horrified.
121 2018-08-16 23:42:18 They have an oil show! Wow. They’ve probably earned a cookie for their efforts. Writing “while swabbing” is total crap
122 2018-08-16 23:41:48 Tea tree oil is the way forward for anyone that struggles with spots, it’s an absolute gem
123 2018-08-16 23:41:35 Finna work this lil gig a few months & den I’m going to da oil field or on that water 
124 2018-08-16 23:41:35 1) Lead has always been bad for us, gas companies stopped putting it in because scientists reported the facts and politicians stepped up to ban it.

2) Those payoffs? For climate change, they go to the oil company stooges/climate deniers like your source Dr Archibald.

130 2018-08-16 23:39:47 So I actually did cut my hair today coz my oil is about to finish
131 2018-08-16 23:39:41 This is about groundwater. For example South Bend Indiana sits on two huge aquifers. Contaminate those and water becomes an issue even with the St. Joseph River running through town. We can't trade oil for water indefinitely. My opinion.
132 2018-08-16 23:39:27 Brazil today Praising Trump, Canada willing to give the U.S. oil, China renegotiate tariffs.. GO POTUS
MAKING U.S. GREAT. #veteransfortrump #MAGA #Leadership
133 2018-08-16 23:39:17 Yes. Once again the elite took if from the common man by making cannabis illegal. It is one of 4 ingredients in the Holy oil of Christ. Now we give it to the common man as Jesus did.

135 2018-08-16 23:38:56 Vaccinate your kids, folks. Oil peddling suburban moms aren’t doctors, no matter how much google they use.
136 2018-08-16 23:38:41 Here is a question. Who have you heard little from with regard to shale oil? The answer is non US refiners. The only people talking are US suppliers and how much they will sell etc. Basically nothing has been said by the buyers. Becaus they are never asked
137 2018-08-16 23:38:25 The #Dow went bang overnight adding 396 pts as China and US to resume trade talks.

139 2018-08-16 23:37:51 @business #DaybreakAmericas. @JennaDags : That oil strike in W. Australia just proves that there's oil everywhere. You just have to drill for it #Jamaica, #WI.
140 2018-08-16 23:37:47 I scramble eggs for my dogs in the microwave and always spray whatever dish I cook in with olive oil first. Eggs wash off super easy that way.
141 2018-08-16 23:37:21 Extra slutty olive oil
142 2018-08-16 23:36:51 For sale: baby shoes, never worn. The baby is an abomination, he orchestrated the BP oil spill on the way from the hospital to our home and should never be given shoes, let alone shoes as good as these. $75

145 2018-08-16 23:36:29 I've used Mobil 1 fifteen thousand mile oil for years, changed once a year (usually under 10 K miles per year). Last car had 120K on it when transmission started to slip, engine had no appreciable wear, full compression. Well worth the extra mazola especially in winter.

150 2018-08-16 23:35:36 Yeah, cook them, and then I throw in some red or orange bell peppers, olive oil, garlic powder, onions etc. although sometimes the onions repeat on me so I skip them, but it’s one of my favorite go to meals. You could really throw anything you like in there.
151 2018-08-16 23:35:29 oh...(´・ω・｀)
152 2018-08-16 23:35:25 American bombs in the Middle East are the only thing holding the dollar together. Right now, countries need dollars to buy oil. If oil producing nations threaten to accept other currencies, the U.S. military isn't far away. It creates phony demand for dollars.
153 2018-08-16 23:35:23 Yeah but sustainable energy and have you even driven one bro? Also you sound like a shill for Big Oil and... sigh I can't even anymore.
154 2018-08-16 23:35:21 In a nutshell, you should be exfoliating a few times a week. Cleanse (or double cleanse), moisturize, and use sunscreen every day. I also use day and night serums and night oil like 5x a week. I also used to do charcoal face masks once a week and those are amazing but I’m lazy.
155 2018-08-16 23:35:04 General Motors should market a drink called 'GMC Sierra Mist'

But replace the actual Sierra Mist with used GMC Sierra Oil
156 2018-08-16 23:34:44 Hi Mike, It is used for good purpose in almost all cases.  I used to buy service station locations for a big oil company.  We would use shelf companies to make the purchases. Maybe a little dodgy but prevented overcharging by avaricious seller to a major corp.
157 2018-08-16 23:34:37 Lmfaooo  mine. Pinche oil field problems. The sun ain’t no joke!

159 2018-08-16 23:34:28 Rape fields are foul, and rapeseed oil, extracted through industrial processes, is slapped in everything. And it's killing us. Fry with lard, beef dripping or coconut oil- they are stable whereas these dreadful oils oxidise and break down into carcinogens.
160 2018-08-16 23:33:48 Hmu if you know where to get organic Coconut oil in Kano, mine is about to finish and it’s what i use for my hair

168 2018-08-16 23:32:13 I hear it’s because they change their oil frequently. Same recipient maybe but better cooking.
169 2018-08-16 23:32:13 At @FamilyFordFargo 4 oil change, air, fuel filters.  Sat for 1.5hrs. No biggie. pickup leaves bay, good done where’s the bill. Oil plug was too tight. Couldn’t change oil. Ok. How much for the air and fuel filters.  we didn’t do them. Topped off fluids no charge....
170 2018-08-16 23:31:18 It's in the brownies used as a fat since, they contain quite a bit of healthy fats and serve the purpose of the oil, that and the taste of chocolate easily overpowers the mild flavor of the avocados.
171 2018-08-16 23:31:16 Photos of Libya show wealthiness during Ghadafi's 22 yrs of ruling. The country has oil, roughly more than easily to feed 6 mio pop. and 3.000 yrs known culture. If you didn't act like Chavez and knew how to unite the people... Before Neofundamentalism destroyed everything.

173 2018-08-16 23:31:07 Trump refuses to listen to 1000s of scientists all over the world from different countries.  He thinks he knows more than the scientists....and oil & gas would die out to wind and solar.

187 2018-08-16 23:28:50 I rub so much coconut oil on my face before I go to sleep I literally look like I’ve been sat in a sauna for three months
188 2018-08-16 23:28:37 How much investment was placed in transporting crude by rail (e.g. loading and unloading) that was wasted? Don’t ever think that oil companies and investors know what they are doing.
189 2018-08-16 23:28:32 I disagree. This is a team that now finds itself leaking oil against terrible teams. Yes 2-2 vs. Sox was great, but 3-8 vs. Marlins, Padres, Reds, and Mets? Lousy teams do that.

226 2018-08-16 23:21:59 Where I'm going with the lead stuff... Years ago, you had to pay extra for gas to have it leaded. They charged you extra to put lead in gas. Then lead became evil and they mandated lead free gas. So the Oil co.'s charged you extra to not put lead in it. Follow the money & payoffs
227 2018-08-16 23:21:39 And they’re not putting any oil on Faysal and Scotty’s lanes and the cups that they get are 3 times the size of level 6 and their bowls that they fill are only half the size do you really call that fair dammit!

You can't extrapolate like that with only a few data points. 
You have no idea of the future. If you regress the line, it stays the same, below 10M. Besides, crude oil is in limited supplies.

290 2018-08-16 23:11:27 Yeah. I was going to throw in snake oil, but I ran out of space.
291 2018-08-16 23:11:24 Ladies and Gents. Do you guys know a good oil/product I can use for nails and cuticles? My hangnails are OC right now.
292 2018-08-16 23:11:11 1- I can work with that answer
2- so with socialism I'll have more take home?
3- didn't answer 3
4- Cuba and Ecuador not comparable to USA Economically or Politically ( Corruption)
5- USA has oil and other resources. How will socialism stop USA from becoming more corrupt? PCB2U
293 2018-08-16 23:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza for dinner today will be: burnt crust with sweet coconut oil and philly beef.
294 2018-08-16 23:10:55 Are you sure?  I do not see any motor oil or pond scum...whoops slipped back to the 70's for a minute.
295 2018-08-16 23:10:54 I've been using coconut oil but I've been told no point as if I'm gonna get them I will. didn't have a problem with them until I took that picture

301 2018-08-16 23:10:18 4m Nuclear Power & privatisation of telecom, power reforms, building roads or cutting oil subsidies, ushering in pension reforms & even a precursor to GST in the form of excise VAT with just 3 rates, #AtalBihariVajpayee record is unmatched. He was, truly, India's biggest reformer
302 2018-08-16 23:10:13 Like an oil tanker tipped at sea
This love's contaminated me
Like a constant twitching in my eye
This love of ours will never die
303 2018-08-16 23:10:12 My dad comes up to me and says “where can I get cbd oil”
304 2018-08-16 23:10:10 Nothing soothes the green and sustainable crowd like a Saudi Oil Sheikh's biatch. I hear Saudi money is just as green as any other money. True?
305 2018-08-16 23:10:09 RT @LivingSafely: #Lays Smooth #Ranch Dip this August? Top four ingredients are water, oil, modified tapioca and corn starch.
306 2018-08-16 23:10:09 I've read it many times and cited it several times. I find it a great antidote to alarmism and oil sands exceptionalism. Sadly, it's true there are a couple of necessary conditions claimed in the paper which are not supported by the data.
307 2018-08-16 23:09:36 picked up the fenty foundation for the first time in a minute and wow she’s real cute when primed with an oil and lightly powdered only in the center of the face !! not as drying as i remember

310 2018-08-16 23:09:18 Not that one with all the mazola oil covered bodybuilders, "pumping iron" the kid already suspects you are gay.
311 2018-08-16 23:09:16 @JoeBiden If Saudi Arabia unlink price of oil from $ and link it to Riyal like exchange currency between buyer and seller then America will enter on collapse because of huge American public debt. Saudis are cowardly but Riyal will became reserve currency on this equation.
312 2018-08-16 23:08:23 adding bath oil in your bath is so relaxing man
313 2018-08-16 23:08:19 Diluted Peppermint oil on temples. Also, place feet in warm water while an ice pack is placed on the back of your neck.

317 2018-08-16 23:07:50 Canada should continue to speak out and divest of trade, especially military sales and oil.
318 2018-08-16 23:07:30 Owowow- some oil splashed onto my hand q x q
319 2018-08-16 23:07:26 LOVE this and the artwork is amazing. I think it's as true when the roles are reversed. I know a number of men who've put their exes in the proverbial writer's bubbling vat of oil and popped them to the moon ;)
320 2018-08-16 23:07:19 Worrying when the oil companies operating in UK can't get their basic facts right... @JoRichardsKent @helenyg @KimSJ

324 2018-08-16 23:06:06 Went to get the oil changed last week.  Pulled in the bay, stepped out the car to go to the lobby, and the mechanic's mouth dropped.  He said "Man! I thought you were Dave Chappelle"!  

Then I thought to myself....  "Damn! I wish you were the bank teller"!   — feeling crazy

362 2018-08-16 23:00:46 It’s not real when it’s all spin to push a political agenda. Like NYTimes front page article about how fracking was a sham, production not sustainable & companies lying in their SEC filings? What happened? It was fake news, production continued, oil prices collapsed.

377 2018-08-16 22:58:11 yes Sir. But first before we install this space-killer Giant Fan we need to ensure people is no longer need land for farming and housing. Second, the EU should stop meddling for oil in middle-east so we can buy cheaper oil from Iran and use the saving to erect this wind catcher.
378 2018-08-16 22:58:05 The only female wrestling allowed should involve baby oil and/or lingerie.

385 2018-08-16 22:56:48 @fergusgreen has done some excellent work starting to probe these knock-on benefits.

Going directly after oil industry is a major political winner for (at least) 2 reasons – voters of almost all stripes hate Big Oil, & you empower green political coalitions while weakening FF.

389 2018-08-16 22:55:56 The hatred, anger and vitriolic rhetoric is stunning. What retribution would be exacted by the left for the election of DJT if allowed back in power?
This thought should motivate voters if nothing else does.
390 2018-08-16 22:55:46 extra slutty olive oil
391 2018-08-16 22:55:42 My hair is always up. Thick, wavy, curly hair is too hard to maintain. Takes me 3-4 hours to straighten it. Only products I use is Argon oil & coconut oil. And of course shampoo/conditioner.
392 2018-08-16 22:55:41 research rosemary oil, I know it helps with hair growth
393 2018-08-16 22:55:29 Sweden has a similarly solid economy/society without large oil reserves. Also the Norwegians were doing pretty good prior to the 70’s (when the became an oil producer). Natural resources aren’t the end all-be all of economics.
394 2018-08-16 22:55:23 Makes you wonder if he's sucking up or has been caught compromised. Slippery as a snake oil salesman.
395 2018-08-16 22:55:19 If you could pull a Rorscach and throw hot oil in someone's face, who would it be? Or should   I even ask.

397 2018-08-16 22:55:09 Then I made some for dinner later and omg never doing them again. I was over here scared thinking I was gonna drop hot oil on myself like my bf did lmao
398 2018-08-16 22:55:06 We need clean renewable energy. Oil is neither.
399 2018-08-16 22:54:52 It is if you pop it in oil and call it "sauteed maize."

401 2018-08-16 22:54:20 You got it! That's their solution, and they'll sell off all of that lumber at top dollar. Then the land is clear to mine and drill for oil, or build on. 
402 2018-08-16 22:54:15 Went to one of Graham Sr crusades in '79. It was all about I have a book for sale here and a cassette for sale there. That's all I got out of his message.

406 2018-08-16 22:53:16 Within last 2 years Exxon bought the Bass acreage, announced plans to increase Permian production by 600kbpd by 2025, a ton of which is light Delaware basin, has inked multiple pipeline deals and announced refinery expansion to use this oil. That speaks volumes.

412 2018-08-16 22:52:53 seriously.. If I start writing about almost every human I interact with, their story and my perspective.. it would surely be worth burning your midnight oil reading!
413 2018-08-16 22:52:13 So that means your brand of Olive Oil is close to hitting the store shelves 
414 2018-08-16 22:52:05 Maybe put thick oil like Castor oil on the ends?
415 2018-08-16 22:51:57 An equal chance to starve. Welcome to the socialist persist of Venezuela with expected inflation this year of 1.000.000%. That is six zeroes. The biggest oil reserves in the planet. I prefer to pray to St Ronald MacDonald's. My poor country.
416 2018-08-16 22:51:57 That’s right, there is no way oil money should be anywhere near this deal, they are the most likely to benefit from Tesla’s failure. This whole idea just seems so naïve to me. the bidding process for this better include so progressive thinkers with deep pockets @tim_cook

419 2018-08-16 22:51:42 2/The mega-project distinction is important. If you check CERI's recent oil sands supply costs study, you'll see that new SAGD projects are barely viable at current WTI and mines are not. Wood Mac also noted global preference for brownfield over greenfield, which Gunter ignored.
420 2018-08-16 22:51:41 I need hair, nails and an oil change
421 2018-08-16 22:51:39 Say what now?? He really said that!? ... about time. Canadian Oil for Canadians! Somewhere, Gerald Butts must be tied up in a roll of duct tape!! No, don't go searching ...
422 2018-08-16 22:51:35 Burning the oil!
423 2018-08-16 22:51:34 what? Just water...without soap...I use water and soap  (followed the oil/toner then moisturise.
424 2018-08-16 22:51:32 But if the government supports high tariffs to protect on industry (dairy), wouldn't a similar tariff (270%) on oil then make EE very attractive?
425 2018-08-16 22:51:29 another huge drop in gold that followed from a huge drop in oil

432 2018-08-16 22:50:23 Doing it myself for the first time I think I successfully changed the oil on my Harley
Basically the same amount of fluids came out as I put back in, bonus was the transmission oil change due to loosening the wrong drain plug when I started (it needed it anyways)

439 2018-08-16 22:49:52 You are probably right. But let's not forget the reason she's in: Years of poor PC performance ($100+ oil for some of those). "Between 2004/05 and 2014/15, the provincial government increased program spending by 98.3 per cent". Kenny hasn't yet shown how he'll fix things.

470 2018-08-16 22:42:12 Was suppose to go get my oil changed earlier but....... I got lazy & didn’t wanna move
471 2018-08-16 22:42:10 I don't know why people are so strange! KSA is currently redirecting its sights to rely less on oil, and I think this is a great thing to know! I think that the right thing to do would be encourage governments like gulf countries to rely less on fossil fuels, and Elon does that
472 2018-08-16 22:41:56 Then make una stop sabotaging the effort of who wan work now! Abeg tell us who dem go hand over to ? Clark or asakiri dokunbo or tompolo and there won’t be oil war from that region.

491 2018-08-16 22:39:40 I would not be surprised if oil companies did fund politicians - but I never saw any for sceptics and I even wrote to them as Chairman of the Scottish Climate and Energy Forum. The response: NOTHING. They didn't want to know us.

493 2018-08-16 22:39:29 At the end of the day, aren’t we all just a LITTLE curious if @HelloFresh is sponsored by Big olive oil?
494 2018-08-16 22:39:01 I think Harpercons really own the never to be finished keystone line,because why would thier friends in Houston want to stop the$27 discount on Canadian oil.
495 2018-08-16 22:38:56 NP! One day you might want to invest in a deep fryer. That way you don't have to worry about getting splashed with hot oil.
496 2018-08-16 22:38:54 1. Your argument was it was okay because of potential earnings. If that's the bar then they wouldn't care.
2. The difference berween Iran & Saudi Arabia is negligible. We didn't overthrow a democratically government in SA to get oil cheaper.
497 2018-08-16 22:38:31 Scam. They're always oil company people. I got an "emmanuel that was in my cds" too one time and apparently our cds president too sef had applied

509 2018-08-16 22:36:24 I hope the long term plan includes diversification since no economy should be dependent on one industry especially oil since most nations are moving to green energy.
510 2018-08-16 22:36:12 How do people cope with this idiot really? Has price reduced compare to when crude oil was sold at 32 and now? These buharidindinrins don't have common sense whatsoever.

518 2018-08-16 22:35:12 I am surprised at the very unscientific attitude coming from an Engineer. Your lack of knowledge of Uranium and the claim of the use of steam in fracking (steam is used in oil extraction- not hydraulic fracturing) makes me question if you actually are an Engineering graduate.

532 2018-08-16 22:32:38 Our luxury taxes have increased. I'm OK with that. Cigs, gas, oil, junk food. If America did that, universal healthcare would be a reality. 
We don't pay much more than you do.

534 2018-08-16 22:32:18 Sad commentary. I'm old enough to remember when so-called republicans revered the Military, praised Law Enforcement, claim they were Christians, and their rhetoric was "the rule of law"... Now they willing to die for a Snake oil salesman with a orange tan! It's just sad.
535 2018-08-16 22:32:13 with a montana judge holding up the keystone pipline again its painfully obvious the USA is more interested in our $27 discounted oil than letting the cpc investors get thier gift to houston freinds built.

554 2018-08-16 22:28:50 Oh and the mockingbird stuff, just pay attention from ww2 and beyond. Pay attention to who we imported after hitlers fall and who they went to work for after. Operation paperclip. The nazis went to work at places like IBM, standard oil, and even Hollywood that we brought over.
555 2018-08-16 22:28:35 I hate paying for oil changes I hate my life
556 2018-08-16 22:28:27 full ingredients; bacon, mushrooms, olive oil, butter, parmesan, milk, garlic, salt, pepper, herbs, butter, pinch of flour to thicken it - that all combines into the sauce. bit of green onion on top.

Well I never realised that was you from LSE...now I know 
562 2018-08-16 22:28:02 Yay for fossil fuels! Let's not progress, lets just keep using coal. When coal & oil run out so you can't run dump trucks & diggers in coal mines then just find something else to dig up & burn. FFS don't use solar! AWESOME PLAN YOU HAVE
563 2018-08-16 22:28:00 Whoa! Don’t forget GBjr for sending you into a war to find WMDs because he and his conspirators plotted 9/11 and blame it on a guy who doesn’t exist. All to tell you there were no WMDs. But Hussein is dead. So we’re good, no? Hussein was KJU. GBjr wins. Hands down. All for oil.
564 2018-08-16 22:27:51 Democrats take money from Fossil Fuel Pacs.  Joe Manchin says he will support Trump.  He's a Democrat.  Good job Democrats, you stand for oil money and supporting Trump if its a politically position.  Nice Resistance.  Who cares about substance if you have a (D) next to your name
565 2018-08-16 22:27:35 If the govt viewed standard oil a “monopoly” how it is possible that Facebook, google, and yes twitter are not monopoly’s? They handle information and since they have proven to be neither unbiased or fair they are a far larger threat than an oil company.

572 2018-08-16 22:26:05 I’m at the adult stage in my life where I counter wanting to spend money with spending it on necessities. 
Get an urge to shop? Better go pick up my meds or get my oil changed and cry about it... progress.
573 2018-08-16 22:25:54 はいてない。
574 2018-08-16 22:25:53 Cream oil sounds amazing right now!!!
575 2018-08-16 22:25:28 I bought a Jamaican black castor oil shampoo and I am amazed at how beautiful it left my curls :,) I think I found my product
576 2018-08-16 22:25:21 Take a bath with a few drops of lavender essential oil, or try diffusing lavender essential oil near your head while trying to sleep. Personally, a blend of frankincense + lavender + clary sage works for me. (Don’t drink the oils!)
577 2018-08-16 22:25:19 Thought I smelled burning oil...
578 2018-08-16 22:25:16 I’m waiting for my oil change and my mom sends me a screenshot of a message my brother sent to her talking about me and now I’m crying in public  feeeeeels af 
579 2018-08-16 22:25:12 I would like it if oil was. Green energy is forward thinking and a better long term investment. Our dirty oil isn’t.

584 2018-08-16 22:24:45 ah, the sweet smell of burning oil
585 2018-08-16 22:24:36 Until it get fully operational then we will still need to rely on oil and natural gas
586 2018-08-16 22:24:08 Because sautéing it in oil and garlic makes it better.
587 2018-08-16 22:24:06 Was thinking an oil spike, but so far shale has contained the price. It looks more like the oil spike is coming after systemic collapse & will only compound the problem. The triggers are going to be interest rates going higher, weakness in real estate, & consumer/corporate debt.
588 2018-08-16 22:23:57 @BBCRadio2  hi Sara I am on night shift on the Magnus oil rig in the North Sea one week in to a 3 week trip gutted you are going on holidays for the next 2 weeks   You make the night shift better.       Cheers Steven !!!

603 2018-08-16 22:21:06 -PLASTICS ARE MADE FROM NON-RENEWABLE RESOURCES, CONTRIBUTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE 
They are made of finite resources such as crude oil(e.g: propylene) and it’s life cycle shows that it creates greenhouse gases, contributing to climate change.
604 2018-08-16 22:20:57 Every vegan diet either winds up high starch, or loaded with avocados and olive oil. There is just no way to get calories otherwise. They only have low-fat health claims with what they consider "science" so most gravitate to the starch side.
605 2018-08-16 22:20:47 The mistake people made was believing the lies of snake oil salesmen like Farrage. The kind of Brexit promised by the leave camp simply isn't deliverable.
606 2018-08-16 22:20:37 #tytlive  Does Indonesia have oil?
607 2018-08-16 22:20:37 I’ve not read many Greenpeace opinion pieces but I think although they know sustainable palm oil is the long term solution to conserving wildlife, it’s not an easy message to convey, so their overarching advice is to drop palm oil altogether, much like Iceland’s (flawed) stance..
608 2018-08-16 22:20:34 No one ever said the fall of crude oil prices is the cause of poverty. Point of correction. Point 2, our poverty is not about leadership alone, it’s also about followership. It’s about burrowing from banks and refusing to pay back (silver bird) etc
609 2018-08-16 22:20:18 I wore rosemary oil today instead of deodorant and my arm pits feel great lmao

626 2018-08-16 22:18:34 Don’t get them stuck on your plate to begin with. Try using some oil or butter before cooking
627 2018-08-16 22:18:33 Interesting but nothing new or unexpected. Mangers look 5-10 years ahead, not 40. They will all have retired now. When you've billions invested in gas and oil fields you can only move slowly. We are now 34 years into Dr Wrigley's  40 years and temp rise will be at low end of 1/

634 2018-08-16 22:17:41 This pumpkin spice is so getting out of hand, I'm expecting this fall when I take my truck in for an oil change, I'll have the option of pumpkin spice Valvoline.
635 2018-08-16 22:17:35 Flip side to this ...by voting the 2 party system you are helping to maintain the status quo. No affordable healthcare, never ending wars with billions spent on defense and a democratic party that now back slides on taking money from oil companies.

655 2018-08-16 22:15:14 In Canada i think there are 2 motivations. One is genuine fear of GHG. When confronted with the alternative (no oil consumption), they are more afraid what it means to them. Second ones are those threatened AB & SK gain economic & political power. That fear needs addressing

All the things we're facin', makes us question it. 
Lead us to salvation. 
Pour that oil please. 
That’s how we become kings and queens. 
714 2018-08-16 22:06:49 USD is backed by oil - Guns is what idiot Americans spend their USDs on
715 2018-08-16 22:06:25 おはようございます
716 2018-08-16 22:06:16 Borage Seed Oil is probably the richest source of Omega 6 gamma linoleic acid (GLA), that most Americans are found to be deficient in
717 2018-08-16 22:06:13 My wife would say global warming may be caused by those black bean, corn, diced chilies, quac and salsa tacos I ate for 2 days and the after effects! They were awesome. Fried the shells in coconut oil.
718 2018-08-16 22:06:10 Caster oil
719 2018-08-16 22:06:01 Economists attribute jobs losses to slow oil. Restaurants + bars are thriving in AB.40 k perm full time jobs created!

723 2018-08-16 22:05:18 I was fired from a job six months after Reagan took office but I found a better job within a month. Many Gulf oil workers also were laid off when Reagan repealed Carter's import oil tax, but overall the job market proved greatly.
724 2018-08-16 22:05:05 You're better off deep frying them in Vegetable oil then if you have a big enough frying pan.
725 2018-08-16 22:04:51 Thing my wife will ask me to do when I sit down

726 2018-08-16 22:04:49 No strange man, I did not drool on my jumper. It is beard oil from a rogue cap this morning. Stop staring at me thanks.
727 2018-08-16 22:04:40 Right now, at today's prices, heating Oil is 10% cheaper in ROI, not 50% more expensive.

I see you have Rangers on your timeline.  
That explains the incredibly spurious numbers you've supplied 
728 2018-08-16 22:04:22 Hemp oil and CBD oil are technical EXACTLY the same. HEMPSEED oil is different though.
729 2018-08-16 22:03:59 This is just a way for the retail arm of Big Oil to stay relevant. They won't.

The same thing goes with hydrogen fuel cell cars.
730 2018-08-16 22:03:47 I got #50 airtime from Mobil oil....fifty naira airtime.. engine oiil of 4k5 i am suffering
731 2018-08-16 22:03:44 No more western blood for failed nations! No more blood for oil!
732 2018-08-16 22:03:31 20% off on House of cultivar, Emerald Evolution, Cultured Elements, North Coast Growers, Kudu, Kola Bear Oil, NW Finest, and $18 NW Finest Oil!!! So much on sale and it’s all for you.
733 2018-08-16 22:03:28 The UK has the 20th most expensive fuel prices in the world. If you think that wars over oil are for our benefit you’re deluded.
734 2018-08-16 22:03:07 Me heart is broken for the farmer looking at those grass stained knees. The trick is to douse them with baby oil the day before washing. It's a weird world, welcome.
735 2018-08-16 22:03:04 Cuz you’re knee deep naked in olive oil. That’s why!
736 2018-08-16 22:02:36 Let me massage your entire body with body oil while you vent to me about how long your day was 
737 2018-08-16 22:02:27 NEVER putting coconut oil on my skin again. I’ve been slipping and sliding all over the place at work and everything is sticking to me. This shit is gross idk how y’all do it
738 2018-08-16 22:02:24 Now, as I watch the sunrise.
Ah, the smell of oil, the morning light.
There's but one shadow cast on the asphalt.
739 2018-08-16 22:01:50 Late 1970s-early 80s I worked in Yemen. Heartbreaking to watch a beautiful country devolve into chaos. All the usual suspects: Saudi meddling, short-sighted western foreign policy & aid in the region, oil, corruption. Result: kleptocracy leading to chaos, war.
740 2018-08-16 22:01:41 @ctvottawa No!  If Second Cup serves cannibis,  then they should sell alcohol and cigarettes.  I hate smoke and don’t support cannibis in smoke form!  Liquid, oil, edible. Fine.  But I don’t want to smell it!
741 2018-08-16 22:01:18 Im from Tha Era w/ Phrases like: "Ya cant Slick a can ah Oil" "Dont let da Door hit ya(Fill in da blank)Ain it Mayne
742 2018-08-16 22:01:10 He's destroying protected habitats so that oil can be drilled for. He says climate change is a lie. He refuses to believe that coal is filthy and toxic to the environment. China are actively changing their environmental policies as we speak.
743 2018-08-16 22:00:59 Slice up a cucumber and some cherry tomatoes, add chicken and black olives and toss it in a dressing of olive oil, lemon juice, and red wine vinegar and thank me later 
744 2018-08-16 22:00:56 I love it when a plan comes together. Dad loved his surprise portrait, in fact he was bowled over by it.

This makes it all worthwhile for me.

A STROLL THROUGH RISLEY MOSS oil on canvas 16” x 20” commissioned piece.
745 2018-08-16 22:00:56 Watching Bob Ross paint makes me wanna actually oil paint again......the only thing keeping me back right now is the fact my paint cleaner and medium are in the cabinets back at the art studio at my college....OOPS. Bless me getting them back on Monday.
746 2018-08-16 22:00:44 Tanning with olive oil is KEYYY

Ate a peach
Had some ginseng
Drank green tea with ginger
Took cbd oil

Talked to God
Today's been a nice day

752 2018-08-16 22:00:06 Need to pack everything I own, change my oil, do laundry, and work probably 30 hours in the next 3 days.  
753 2018-08-16 22:00:03 Babe really wanted to hug and kiss me even tho i was covered in oil and grease from the tools at work

756 2018-08-16 21:59:20 You don’t need an oil dipstick that long.
757 2018-08-16 21:59:18 Bernie is no Dem & shouldn't be allowed on our ticket (@TomPerez made it so you have to be a Dem, thank you) you couldn't pay me to vote for the lying, backstabbing snake oil salesmen. #GoAwayBernie
758 2018-08-16 21:59:13 I just got a oil pen today but it’s pure thc but I heard it really helps to chill you out and sleep
759 2018-08-16 21:58:44 I just tire my guy. We have money we have money, yet we can't construct simple road or have 24 hours power supply. We can't even pay salary once oil price drops. China has the highest number of billionaires in the world. The county is not squeaky clean of corruption.
760 2018-08-16 21:58:44 You didn’t hear about the guy who fell in a vat of oil at Disney?!
761 2018-08-16 21:58:40 Not sure what no oil would do for Norwegian GDP.
762 2018-08-16 21:58:12 Because of oil is what you are saying, yet they can cut the oil coming into America and we can start drilling for oil here in the states.
763 2018-08-16 21:58:10 Why have people convinced themselves that climate change is a hoax like why why would we do that how are things like renewable energy and recycling corrupt in any way why do you love gasoline and oil so much as an average joe
764 2018-08-16 21:58:09 There are multipliers that amplify trade shocks, even in the long-run.  I know, a bit inconsistent with naive standard agg production function culture.  But clearly there if you look at the data for natural resource finds.  No oil wouldn't just reduce GDP by 13%.
765 2018-08-16 21:58:08 Any of you ladies fathers oil tycoons and wanna get married? Looks not necessary. Preferably a full set of teeth but I’m not picky.
766 2018-08-16 21:58:00 Direct the Qatar Ambassador to @ElgeyoMarakwetC where we've got oil and arable land whose surplus food crop will be exported to Qatar! @qatar @MOI_QatarEn
767 2018-08-16 21:57:59 If everyone without a septic tank  acted as if they had one, what goes down drains would be less 'toxic'. Gentler cleaners, no bleach, no wet wipes, no fat and oil - it's not difficult to manage like this. It's second nature to some of us.
768 2018-08-16 21:57:56 Burning the midnight oil - again. One must find work/life balance.
769 2018-08-16 21:57:30 i need an oil cartridge, who da pluggg?
770 2018-08-16 21:57:03 Are you for real? The combustible engine is far from dead, in fact we're using more oil, not less. Btw there's nothing grn about those cars eg battery.
771 2018-08-16 21:56:56 High School Choir performance, 3500-person audience! 

My first solo coming up. 

15 mins to curtain I grab from purse in the dark & chug tiny vial I thought was lemon juice (for tightening vocal chords). 

It was full strength Frangipani perfume oil. 

Numb.
772 2018-08-16 21:56:56 Repubes are the snake oil salesmen of fiscal responsibility. Borrow and spend, give it to their rich donors. They want to bankrupt the country, so the can kill Medicare and Social Security.
773 2018-08-16 21:56:31 It probably should have been, but currently it feels like someone is drilling for oil in my head. D:
774 2018-08-16 21:56:21 You do realize there is already oil rigs off of the cost of CA! 

New ones would be safer!
775 2018-08-16 21:56:04 Burn the midnight oil. But, be careful. This Republican Party is diabolical and sinisterly since they have become The Party of Trump
776 2018-08-16 21:56:01 Me making calls: hi do you have any concerns about your experience with us?
Customer: uh yes I do actually, you guys didn’t change the sticker that tells me when to get my next oil change is 


777 2018-08-16 21:55:59 that shirt is OD too. get the oil slick mug to go with it
778 2018-08-16 21:55:55 I didn’t think it was but am I right to think oil before moisturiser? I’m so confused....
779 2018-08-16 21:55:36 You can sauté the veggies and put it on a whole grain pasta with olive oil! You KNOW that isn’t a bad dish! Lol
780 2018-08-16 21:55:33 --removed. And just in case anyone would like to see her naked, riding a dildo and smearing baby oil on her fake tits, let me know. I'm saving you folks money by offering a service she was willing to provide for free a while back, before wanting to charge.

782 2018-08-16 21:55:17 I lost my tea tree oil. I'm over.
783 2018-08-16 21:55:13 I use coconut oil to do Jacobs hair and the first time I did he said his hair smelled like candy
784 2018-08-16 21:55:01 I have an appointment Saturday morning!! Oil on 6% 
785 2018-08-16 21:54:53 We keep our hair healthy with a daily boost of omegas and biotin! Sea buckthorn oil is the hair-nurturing supplement for us! 
786 2018-08-16 21:54:37 It hasn't kept England afloat. It has kept the UK afloat. Although if you are clawing Aberdeen and its service industry has probably benefited most from oil since 1978.
787 2018-08-16 21:54:26 I guess digging for oil is more tricky that flipping a burger?
788 2018-08-16 21:54:17 Says a PSG fan LMAO without oil money you are nothing but a bunch of baguette merchants
789 2018-08-16 21:54:12 You're on an island w/unlimited supply of 5 foods & 5 spices, + 2 of the following: vinegar, olive oil, & butter. What would they be?

790 2018-08-16 21:54:09 What is the best kind of oil to massage your enemies with?... turmoil
791 2018-08-16 21:53:51 Nothing yet lol I’m waiting on my sister. But it’s gone be up.. braids most likely. This hair growth oil messing my face up.
792 2018-08-16 21:53:23 It’s funny though because every time I had talked to the offices of Hatch, Lee and Bishop, they all said there was no mining or oil drilling that was profitable or at all within the boundaries and that it was all about ranching and access. Apparently the access was for mining.
793 2018-08-16 21:53:21 "The curse of oil."
794 2018-08-16 21:53:14 If I break your heart na oil spillage

795 2018-08-16 21:53:09 LMAO. He is truly taking the L. Assuming it was really him months ago who argued with you (I believe it wasn't), he is looking fucking stupid right now. I guess he learned the first lesson of oil......don't fuck with the elephant. #WTI #OOTT #CrudeOil #Crude #Brent #OPEC #CL_F
796 2018-08-16 21:52:52 At work!?  one time Day was looking over the wall  (but I hadn’t noticed him) as I was rubbing my oil on my bewbs when I felt someone looking at me I looked up and he was like  I laughed and said HI DAY! But he disappeared instead

800 2018-08-16 21:51:58 Knowing the difference between a timing belt and timing chain has saved me over $1000 in mechanic recommended maintenance. Stay informed, read the manual, change the oil.
801 2018-08-16 21:51:53 Yes it do when you pay for the big time warranty (including tire hazards, oil changes and stuff)
802 2018-08-16 21:51:47 I can tell by the condition of the streets, Flynt has no money. Taxation embezzlement? 

I'm happy to donate my share of federal taxes to the people of Flynt to build a new water system.

Lines of cars like this reminds me of the gas crisis of '73 from mid east oil embargo.
803 2018-08-16 21:51:31 Ooh! I use @GreenPeopleUK intensive repair shampoo and conditioner. Also Wonder Oil from Holland & Barrett  Thank you x

806 2018-08-16 21:51:19 Try coconut oil for the dryness leave it in for a couple hours but make sure and warm it first  hope it helps
807 2018-08-16 21:51:17 A further comment......at the Coronation of our Kings and Queens here in the UK, during the ceremony there is a private section unseen by the public and it is the "anointing" with oil.  A very ancient and significant ceremony based on traditions thousands of years old.
808 2018-08-16 21:51:07 席ガチャ後ろから数えた方が早いし、アイチュウとグラブルで爆死した分かな……
809 2018-08-16 21:51:00 2 teams from that part of the world? Some oil baron doubled his worth for sure on this game.
810 2018-08-16 21:50:57 Fossil fuel - oh I get you.
And oil companies funded wind blah blah.
811 2018-08-16 21:50:51 Him: What are you getting from Big Lots?

Me: Coconut oil, of course

Him: Ah.

Me: Probably some other stuff to eat as well... On-the-go type of stuff like fiber bars or something.

Me: You know... Stuff that has Roundup weed killer in it.
812 2018-08-16 21:50:34 mood: my phone doesn't recognize my thumbprint because i have "chill out" essential oil all over my hands
813 2018-08-16 21:50:28 Pretty good! Do you like action shoot ‘em ups? I like THE MECHANIC. Do you like *buckwild* gonzo fearless crazy stuff? See CRANK. Do you like shirtless motor oil fights? TRANSPORTER. I’m like a Statham sommelier.

816 2018-08-16 21:50:20 When you guys invent planes, cars, the internet, moon landings, fission, computers, satellites, cell phones,  skyscrapers, etc let me know. You guys were sitting on huge oil and let ARAMCO take it for pennies. Western technology and science is the only reason oil is worth money
817 2018-08-16 21:50:17 Amazing, easy, healthy pancakes. 1 banana, 2 eggs, cinnamon, blend with stick blender. Heat olive/coconut oil in pan. Cook on low, serve with berries  We have them every morning! 
818 2018-08-16 21:50:03 Try oregano oil under the tongue. It burns but it’s good and will clear up everything.
819 2018-08-16 21:49:55 ええ……嬉しい……今日私事故って死なない？
820 2018-08-16 21:49:53 I love a lot more now than I did in the 80s. It was a ghost town when oil left. I was just there last October and a couple of times before that in the last 10 years to see my Oklahomies. It's like a different city.
821 2018-08-16 21:49:45 @MapMyWalk accepting sponsorship from/promoting Muscle milk snake oil had me close to deleting the app. Just FYI
822 2018-08-16 21:49:44 I put tea tree oil under my nose for the dryness and now all I smell is Pine-Sol
823 2018-08-16 21:49:36 dude i fucking hate it when im frying stuff and i throw something in and hot oil spatters all over my glistening naked body and drips down my silky smooth buttcheeks
824 2018-08-16 21:49:24 My nightstand is a mess i have a bag of leftover doritos 3 bottles of water half empty, an empty yogurt box, a spoon covered with labne and an olive oil bottle. Will I be killed by my mother in the morning? Stay tuned
825 2018-08-16 21:49:20 It will not end with another war because this regime has no people support they just can fight till they have oil money.The best policy is making sanctions harder and helping us in Iran to change this backward ass regime.

829 2018-08-16 21:48:50 A self serving photo op. Cory does the bidding of Putin’s buddy Roman Abramovich who owns Pueblo steel mill EVRAZ. Cory and Rick are big oil, frack it all guys.

Bread "May you be nourished & cared for"
Honey "May you enjoy the sweetness of life"
Olive Oil "May you be blessed & safe"
833 2018-08-16 21:47:43 Can it not rain for an hour so i can do my oil change? Plz 
834 2018-08-16 21:47:41 His tax cuts and the resulting economic boom was responsible for bringing the U.S. out of the doldrums of the 70s...Arab Oil embargo,Vietnam debacle, Carter malaise and Iranian revolution. His leadership won the Cold war, rebuilt the military & led a two decade economic expansion
835 2018-08-16 21:47:41 “Bolster support” means “intimidate & threaten”, like what t/USA did to Ecuador to make them stop promoting breast feeding and buy US infant formula instead. 

Our attacks on Iran= gratifying Saudis (& Israel) to keep prices low on their oil, & keep s.a. investments in t/ USA.

843 2018-08-16 21:46:37 He' wants tax breaks? Make them run on canola oil or maple syrup.
844 2018-08-16 21:46:37 As someone deathly allergic to shellfish who reacts to fried shrimp in the same oil as french fries, I'd love to take the original and the generic and jab them into the eyes of a a snarky rep from Mylan-Pfizer and say "evaluate which did the better job of killing you"...Asshole.
845 2018-08-16 21:46:34 詫び石でBBちゃん当てました……
846 2018-08-16 21:46:34 I find that kind of clean scary.
 It's all down here from there on in. Imagine the 1st oil spill - oh the guilt!

On our boat. 
Drop the oil filter, take off your "engine t-shirt" and mop it all up and feel proud of the oil change as planned and an added shiny clean up!
847 2018-08-16 21:46:27 Not to throw oil on the fire but,, did they ever discover why the E Coyotes attacked and killed that Canadian singer? I'm guessing it had to be something critical since they generally just want to be left alone.
848 2018-08-16 21:45:54 Korea is still testing nuclear weapons and you can not do anything cos n korea means china and china is not iraq :)) Df 41 will kick your ass you are attacking iran cos they have plenty of oil :))) my friend wake up you are melting down

850 2018-08-16 21:45:22 i know the mix like oil and water
851 2018-08-16 21:45:19 Excessively concerned? He wants mutual respect between countries. 
Cutting regulations for oil, coal and business. Leaving Paris Agreement. Tax cuts, job growth. Illegal immigration and sanctuary cities. Judges who are Constitutionally minded. Draining the swamp. I’m for those!
852 2018-08-16 21:45:01 I remember my other half used bio oil until I read the ingredients  ( read ingredients on whatever you are using) but when that little bundle comes out it's amazing how stretch marks are not important, your brain will make you forget everything hoping you go again 
853 2018-08-16 21:44:47 My favourite pizza: potato, mozzarella, rosemary, sage, garlic, olive oil. Optional extras: gorgonzola, chilli.
854 2018-08-16 21:44:31 If you have a British or American passport and not working in the big 6 oil companies then what are you really doing in Nigeria. Yes this is a sub to a certain somebody cause I don't get it. Cold no to bad like that.
855 2018-08-16 21:43:43 Classic tactic: package your snake oil economics as a simple question & get a “trusted fictional expert” to say it.

857 2018-08-16 21:43:22 i have a website.
i threadneedle to 100% renewables.
i think tossing millions lucky onshore
oil royalties into depression should only
happen after ending war for oil.
tossing them into depression prematurely
complicates our going to 100% renewables.
858 2018-08-16 21:43:20 I agree. A new category always has true pioneers & well-intentioned people. Sadly it often comes with a more massive wake of snake oil salespeople & charlatans.
859 2018-08-16 21:42:51 I found my old lye from years ago & still have a jug of canola oil which I only just opened today. Canola makes the best hard bar soap! I'm getting excited about doing this again! Like old times! Best to do it when warm so windows are open.

861 2018-08-16 21:42:49 I love these! Protip: olive oil the top of the muffin before sauce. Dollop and spread with back of spoon. Take it next level.
862 2018-08-16 21:42:41 Oil spills on both the east and west coast, raw sewage pumped into both the Pacific and Atlantic! So obviously deliberate and yet no Canadians react. Destroying our history but almost no reaction. Blowing about $40 billion Cdn but none react. Broke numerous Cdn laws, none react
863 2018-08-16 21:42:36 hot oil
864 2018-08-16 21:42:18 Yes sad Canada importing oil from Saudi Arabia  we need nation building pipelines
865 2018-08-16 21:42:08 Alberta is* the land of milk and money

*until the oil runs out lmao
866 2018-08-16 21:41:55 This is interesting.  Are operators backing down due to flaring limits over run or is production dropping or both?  More wells producing here then last month indicating production drop but if it’s flaring limits oil production will need to drop another 120kbd to meet state laws.
867 2018-08-16 21:41:47 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
868 2018-08-16 21:41:46 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

879 2018-08-16 21:40:28 Maybe they should've extinguished the sacred flame? They gave police an opportunity to claim, under current weather conditions, an open fire is a safety issue. Imagine. An open fire in a forested residential area, during a state of emergency -- next to an oil tank farm.

887 2018-08-16 21:39:21 Sounds delicious!  My favourite way of cooking courgettes is griddled with some feta and mint over the top with a splash of olive oil.

889 2018-08-16 21:39:18 I would love to try out some essential oil nasal inhalers. I don’t know if it’s a good or bad thing. But I just wanna enhance my breathing.
890 2018-08-16 21:39:13 I fucking splashed hot cooking oil on my right thumb. And of course, I can't use hot water to help relieve it because I live in a part of the world where it's so hot, you can't get cold running water because the pipes are constantly heated.
891 2018-08-16 21:39:04 Vitamin e oil babe.
892 2018-08-16 21:38:38 If you want to argue about oil sands and GHGs, might I suggest that you consult a great paper by Swart and Weaver. Doing so will allow you to assess the impact of oil sands extraction at expected levels on global temperatures. I can put you in touch with the authors if you like.
893 2018-08-16 21:38:37 either way, the yuan denominated futures moves along markers in the Gulf such as Oman + adjustment for exchange rates.  In other words, it is not pricing oil on its own.
894 2018-08-16 21:38:33 My guess is the CNY oil price is likely to be unchanged assuming constant supply whether the RMB moves up or down as China is responsible for marginal demand growth. But on US$ oil I defer to your superior insight
895 2018-08-16 21:38:27 I don't remember that I remember them taking the protest and the rights of the native people and the oil politics behind the project seriously

903 2018-08-16 21:37:18 I've yet to meet a Norweigan that shares your view about Scotland and believe me, I've met many, so let's put you to the test my oil savvy friend, how many Norwegians are actively involved with their shipbuilding industry & why is it successful when Scotlands was closed down?
904 2018-08-16 21:37:03 I’m going to upload a recipe soon. And I’ll suggest eliminating the oil

909 2018-08-16 21:36:33 motor oil isnt for drinking
910 2018-08-16 21:36:20 Yes you would be correct if the US$ oil price had been flat over the past 6 weeks but Brent is down so the CNY oil price is flat. 

Or if you're looking forward then yes that is possible

931 2018-08-16 21:32:50 I didn’t make the opposite claim, generally speaking. Merely that Norway’s outlier status in GDP/c even among the other Nordics (who have similar policies) owes a lot to oil.

960 2018-08-16 21:28:38 The point is that the futures is highly correlated with other oil prices and has to be adjusted to the lower yuan. That means higher prices in yuan.

I have been talking to the most ignorant POS underrighter on the planet. 
The question.

995 2018-08-16 21:23:27 It’s one of the spreads that has certified sustainable palm oil. So I’m happy to buy it unless someone tells me it’s still wrong to buy.
996 2018-08-16 21:23:15 Lexi, give me a shout when you're going to have another shower and I'll pop round to rub on lashings of baby oil afterwards .
997 2018-08-16 21:23:04 I've got a great idea, the greatest idea, just the best: sell the strategic oil reserve to the Iranians. Either that, or put it on eBay

999 2018-08-16 21:22:52 Norway has an oil fund whether you dispute that or not it is and remains one of the richest most successful countries on our planet WHY people like you should talk down Scotlands potential is simply beyond reason, Made particularly bizarre having lived there?
1000 2018-08-16 21:22:48 Maybe smear some butter or oil on the dish before you cook?? Not sure if it’ll work but worth a shot. Or...do like Abby and use a Bunsen burner and a pan!!

1004 2018-08-16 21:22:15 The report says the Marine who was shot "stabilized" at 1800. So I don't know where you get the claim that the guard was a "murderer."  And I have watched Turkey assisting ISIS for 4 years. Erdogan's son-in-law was buying their oil.
1005 2018-08-16 21:22:09 Iran has already warned of this. 
It controls the Straits of Hormuz. 
Be prepared for a steep rise in oil price, and petrol shortages.

1007 2018-08-16 21:22:00 And I have backed up my claim with facts,on the order hand u claimed buhari never caused recession and claimed low oil price and other useless excuses was responsible without backing it up with facts. So u know ur not stating any fact thankGod u admitted.

1020 2018-08-16 21:20:29 Thanks. Do you know of specific locations that had oil operations in the fire zone that I might ask about?
1021 2018-08-16 21:20:28 Wouldn't trust Labour as far as I could throw them.  Tony Benn hid Scotland's oil and buried the McCrone report.  Stood with the Tories in indyref. Gordon Brown gave us the vow - now broken. They do not have Scotland's interest at heart. They just want power and need us to get it
1022 2018-08-16 21:20:28 Got an oil change all by myself it’s over I’m an adult

1027 2018-08-16 21:20:00 They became a kingdom of riches by exporting their prized natural resources.  We become ever more indebted by our dependency on said resources.  Oil is dirty no matter where it comes from but at least it's OUR oil and we pay OUR citizens well for extracting it, no need to ship it
1028 2018-08-16 21:19:58 Nadine, really? Toughen up girl friend. My first car used more oil than gasoline. I'm in my sixties now & entertainment has seldom worked its way into my budget becasue priorities. It's fine for others to have different priorities but that doesn't make their employer responsible.
1029 2018-08-16 21:19:51 Think they were wondering why I was taking pictures! I was just killing time waiting for an oil change.

1033 2018-08-16 21:19:18 There aren’t that many wild places left in our nation so why pollute this one with toxic oil? Every pipeline leaks, every single one. Let’s move toward a fossil fuel free future and build a sustainable infrastructure for renewable energy resources.

1040 2018-08-16 21:18:24 Two reasons:
1. It’s cheaper for Eastern Canada right now ( Until it’s not ie. 70s oil embargo which partly led to the NEP) 

2. Laurentian elites would rather be dependent on foreign oil than Alberta oil.
1041 2018-08-16 21:18:22 Like! 

Do know how much beard oil is?? Smh
1042 2018-08-16 21:18:19 - Drink water (minimum 2-4 bottles daily

- Sleep (minimum 7 hours)

1044 2018-08-16 21:17:30 It’s all about money, oil, competition...maybe it’s not working out how they hoped but maybe it is, too. For a country with an economy the size of Italy they are getting a lot of play, making a comeback.  Anyhow Trump just wants in to the gang, and teamed up theirs unstoppable.
1045 2018-08-16 21:17:22 // Tea tree oil has fucked up my face.

1052 2018-08-16 21:16:26 I looked like a pyromaniac coming out of Lowe’s today.  I had two bags of charcoal, four small propane cans,  three citronella candles and two bottles of tiki torch oil!

1054 2018-08-16 21:15:53 One of the nastiest things people do is hand someone else a landline phone before wiping it off or leave without cleaning it. ESPECIALLY if you wear makeup. Just tissue it off, something! It’s so gross to be handed one with face smear/oil. lease clean ur landline phones.

1060 2018-08-16 21:15:37 Norway is the *only* nordic country with oil money. Also you're not selling these "homogeneous" memes very well.

Sweden has built folkhemmet for the better part of the 20th century. We recovered pretty dang well from the economy crash and are just allaround doing swell. I dunno

1066 2018-08-16 21:14:33 I don't think they'll succed in that. They didn't stop China starting the Yuan oil futures market - and this is very much in line with that. China now holds the cards. Economically they have the US by the short and curlies.
1067 2018-08-16 21:14:30 I respect those who disagree but please look at facts. Peter Lougheed started the Alberta Heritage Fund to be used to diversify the province of Alberta from the dependence on oil. I met hime and heard his words. The monies were wasted and the people are now facing it's demise.
1068 2018-08-16 21:14:16 Are you fucking kidding me? Wow you just enlightened the world to your narrow minded racist bigotry! 1st I used to work 12-16 hr days working in the oil patch.

1071 2018-08-16 21:14:08 That’s nice, some high school kid saw me hit my oil pen and told me to stay lit.
1072 2018-08-16 21:13:57 Couldn't be further from the truth. Cannabis is the only thing keeping millions of people alive as we speak. Rick Simpson Oil has cured people of many illnesses including cancer but the media won't report it.
1073 2018-08-16 21:13:39 Venezuela seized the means of production and allocated all of it to oil, how is this not socialism's fault?
1074 2018-08-16 21:13:38 They'll be fine. Politicians regularly criticize banking, oil and gas, insurance, pharmaceuticals, technology, airlines, lawyers, education, police, gun manufacturing, pro sports, etc. No reason journalism be off limits, especially when it's so often unprofessional and lacking.

You are short a qt or 2 of used oil.
1096 2018-08-16 21:11:09 Ranchers provide food for Americans, oil serves many uses such as energy, plastics that we all depend on.  You may be able to live with out beef, but not a single American can live in this world with out oil products.  Count the things you own that are made from plastics.

My wife and 2 year old (!) we’re stuck without a car all day today b/c you guys couldn’t finish an oil change and inspection. She dropped off at 10AM
1114 2018-08-16 21:09:34 I had to get an oil change right before work, someone come in to work and compensate for it

1118 2018-08-16 21:09:01 might be the weather but if your skin is producing excess oils it means you’re not giving it enough oil. May want to change your moisturizer to something more hydrating

1120 2018-08-16 21:08:55 Reminds me of LATAM 82 banking crisis. Petro USD (product of oil shock of 70's) found their way to funding everything. When bills came in nobody could pay. Assets and Debts got cut in huge size. Fed did same. Created money that will end up 50c on the dollar when the bill is due
1121 2018-08-16 21:08:32 #OrangutanJungleSchool is the most incredible thing I’ve ever watched!! Everyone should watch it and make an effort to reduce their use of palm oil 
1122 2018-08-16 21:08:27 Remember to check your oil and tyre pressure first.
1123 2018-08-16 21:08:27 Because the oil industry creates jobs and brings money to the country.

If Tesla produced cars in Canada, I could see an argument...but to subsidize them to employ Americans is not right.
1124 2018-08-16 21:08:23 our boss is a oily lady & so is this bride! our serums, combined with our toners reduce oil tremendously!
1125 2018-08-16 21:08:17 Self sustaining grown and hunted food, great water, own electricity, natural gas and oil, working together is the currency not much of a need for money out here other then paying the government for tax but that’s small too not one thing from Cali or New York help me in any way
1126 2018-08-16 21:08:05 It’s called socialism and it’s been tried.
1127 2018-08-16 21:08:00 You can do really, really good lasagne with soy mince; add a little soy sauce, a little tumeric, ginger and coconut oil to give an umami taste to the mince. Also, halloumi fajitas are the absolute tits.

1130 2018-08-16 21:07:39 First it was GEJ that caused PMB's failure.

Then it was drop in oil prices.

Then it was corruption fighting back.

Then it was the Libyans/Chadians/Nigeriens.

Now it is Saraki that caused his failure?

Twits, listen to yourself as you tweet!

Common denominators?

1131 2018-08-16 21:07:31 Just to prove that you totally don't, it's a naked oil massage. You cover each other in lotion and get... real personal.
1132 2018-08-16 21:07:11 My car just started beeping and I couldn’t see the screen and I’m like bitchhh I knew my gas ain’t gone because I just filled up this morning...it’s time for an oil change... 
1133 2018-08-16 21:07:06 My brother worked on the Alaska National oil pipeline at Prudhoe Bay ( Arctic Circle)carried several weapons...NEVER once used them against polar bears They can be aggressive BUT they need a reason This is BS & the Cruise Line knows it if you look at their excuses for shooting
1134 2018-08-16 21:07:00 Wow, you just stand there and BOOM: you have pussy at your feet within minutes.
1135 2018-08-16 21:06:33 I seriously hope this is part of some big oil conspiracy and not legitimate. Slightly suspicious of the fact that this guy is using the same lawyer as Tripp.

1137 2018-08-16 21:06:18 why break edge when you an take cbd oil
1138 2018-08-16 21:06:17 The fact that he dose not have Oil wells blablablabla dose not mean his children, wife friends and close associate don't have all those things. A friend to a thief is 75% a thief too. A friend to a gambler is also a gambler. He is a coded th**f
1139 2018-08-16 21:06:07 Harold Speed’s public domain art book, The Practice and Science of Drawing, talks on an oil painting process that begins with the darkest darks first. 

It’s a bit of a read — it’s an art instruction book that has minimal plates of actual art — but Speed was invaluable to me.
1140 2018-08-16 21:05:42 Bruh just avoid carbs and just do this wake up and eat 2 eggs(2tbs of olive oil) with avocado then for lunch eat 1 pound of chicken whatever breast, thighs, drumsticks, but no sugar flavors just like siracha or you can make chicken salad , then eat like 4 cups of veggies
1141 2018-08-16 21:05:30 Ahh its aloud o. We all did
1142 2018-08-16 21:05:13 @BahiCosmetics Is there a major difference between the Sunday Riley UFO oil and the SunFlower sweets Serum?
1143 2018-08-16 21:05:05 Wife is getting the oil changed in our vehicle and the oil changing place has cats. So this place gets all of our business from now on.
1144 2018-08-16 21:04:23 Thought you were going to comment on the mostly full container of olive oil on my toilet 
1145 2018-08-16 21:04:12 Thank you so much! Your coconut oil is superb!
1146 2018-08-16 21:04:04 This my second time coming up to Walmart to get my oil changed but they need to hurry up because I’m in between clients 
1147 2018-08-16 21:04:04 Totally - been a SEAL since ‘78, but his actions are politically motivated 
1148 2018-08-16 21:03:56 He’s nothing but a snake oil racist pos con man, you’ve been duped
1149 2018-08-16 21:03:51 Sipping oil ass bitch
1150 2018-08-16 21:03:50 This is the real take down and the forever shafting of a shit shifting America. The way a president can oil on America. We still have judges appointed by B-actor Bedtime For Bonzo Ronald Regan. And we’ll have some of them for another 20years. Trump saddles us with 100 Roy Cohens.
1151 2018-08-16 21:03:40 I refuse to smell like Amla oil tomorrow!
1152 2018-08-16 21:03:26 That would make too much sense. And he has proven he has none. His families money is in saudi oil

1154 2018-08-16 21:03:11 "The American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, which represents U.S. refiners, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Perry’s statement." Boosting Mexican oil and gas production could hinder trade opportunities for U.S. refineries and pipeline companies.
1155 2018-08-16 21:03:04 Hate to disagree, but what would it do? Who the hell needs their admissions?
These people are infants, at best.
1156 2018-08-16 21:03:01 Done.

1158 2018-08-16 21:02:36 If you want longer lashes/brows 10/10 recommend castor oil and it’s super affordable

1161 2018-08-16 21:02:16 Whew! Thank goodness she’s prepared. If that runs out, you can always slather on some olive oil.
1162 2018-08-16 21:02:16 I just pictured all of us in a cigar smoke filled, poorly lit, and cramped room. All of covered in ink smudge and papers everywhere. It is an oil painting. Not sure why it isn't black and white but it isn't.
1163 2018-08-16 21:02:10 New oil change procedures
1164 2018-08-16 21:01:43 #OIL: 'With Iranian oil shipments falling out of the equation and oil production being stepped up in other countries accordingly, spare production capacity seems set to decline. This justifies a somewhat higher oil price' - Commerzbank #BrentOil #WTI #OPEC #OOTT
1165 2018-08-16 21:01:41 Well the last one with the oil was pretty public too
1166 2018-08-16 21:01:23 "On 25 July 1990, only a few days before the Iraqi invasion, OPEC officials said that Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates had agreed to a proposal to limit daily oil output to 1.5 million barrels, thus potentially settling differences over oil policy between Kuwait and Iraq."
1167 2018-08-16 21:01:22 I have heard of that drug. So sorry it's screwing u up. I wanted the Marihuana oil 1st. And was given the L yrica 1st. Low dose.
1168 2018-08-16 21:01:17 Bu she actually made a point,ppl look u as old class if u listen to Hausa song or even watch Hausa movies

1170 2018-08-16 21:01:11 ....in the meantime.. I always clean up the spray with a mixture of vinegar, water, and  a little lavender essential oil...I think it works well, and, most importantly,  visitors tell me it works...

1177 2018-08-16 21:00:28 A new dullard party to hopefully split the dullard vote and sink all the dullard parties back to oppostion or not even get voted in!!!
Then it is back to selling used cars and snake oil........
1178 2018-08-16 21:00:27 Obviously, you did not get the message from Routt County!  You use those words to mean that you will let oil drilling, fracking etc., ruin our forests.  You and Zinke need to go!
1179 2018-08-16 21:00:25 August 16, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1180 2018-08-16 21:00:16 Coconut oil is very healthy. It is high in special fats called medium chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently than other fats

1183 2018-08-16 21:00:10 4 Large Portobello mushrooms. Marinade in 2TB olive oil, 1TB soy sauce, juice of 1 lemon, 2 crushed garlic cloves, 4-5 sprigs rosemary, pinch of black pepper. Infuse 30 mins. Grill 5 mins/side. Serve on crusty bread w/horseradish.
1184 2018-08-16 20:59:55 Nope, mayonnaise is eggs and oil.
1185 2018-08-16 20:59:49 My favourite story is one time my stepdad mistook tea tree oil as medicine & swallowed a whole spoonful. It’s very, very poisonous when ingested but before my mother took him to the hospital, she made him sign a piece of paper saying she didn’t try to murder him.
1186 2018-08-16 20:59:44 Lol leave d little girl to enjoy
1187 2018-08-16 20:59:43 Oh good it’s not even true, now let’s focus on Amazon, google, GE, most major banks, virtually all of the oil/ gas industry and hold them to the same standard 
1188 2018-08-16 20:59:41 Your father drinks and smokes illegal weed in and on the property where my step son LIVES. I'm clean and do LEGAL CDB oil, and I'm the problem. It's all a fucking joke. A power trip Bc you've got nothing else. lol my husband and I are your entire life. Thanks! We're great
1189 2018-08-16 20:59:35 Getting home to put beard oil on the yard brush you have attached to your face, pure bliss.
1190 2018-08-16 20:59:32 Hench1: How did he escape? That's filled with hot oil.
Hench 2: ...Oh OIL, I thought you said voil.
1: You wha...wait, voil? What the hell is voil.
2: It's a soft, sheer fabric.
I warmed some up in the dryer.
1191 2018-08-16 20:59:31 Why doesn't the state just take over all private businesses? Give everyone a piece of the oil money and use the military to strike on anyone who disagrees?
1192 2018-08-16 20:59:16 Just to fill the pockets of big oil with a couple of scraps thrown at the people to make it look like something. These guys make me sick.
1193 2018-08-16 20:59:16 Put the flywheel on and new oil in juuuust to find out that modification is needed to the cover for it to work 
1194 2018-08-16 20:59:10 Did anybody really believe donnie's lies about that great tax cut helping the lowly workers? It amazes me to this day how many people buy into his snake oil pitch.
1195 2018-08-16 20:59:06 Also illuminati for getting oil, alot of war is oil when we can use free energy
1196 2018-08-16 20:58:58 If they’re no stealin oil then they’re stealin football 
1197 2018-08-16 20:58:55 Why? Because there is more money in those countries than the population.  Many of these countries can do it on their oil income.  But look at Greece  lol.  This is a failing plan.
1198 2018-08-16 20:58:50 Did a DIY hair mask today featuring egg whites, honey, and coconut oil.

Pros: super soft hair
Cons: I washed my hair with too warm water and had a little scrambled eggs left in there 
1199 2018-08-16 20:58:34 As they say in the oil business, the cure for high prices is high prices
1200 2018-08-16 20:57:58 Ofcorse UK need UAE more than UAE need uk, as long are the oil flow smoothly...
1201 2018-08-16 20:57:56 You don’t know anything about pot. No one is chemically enchancing pot. Get out of here. Hahahaha. Cannabis oil can be obtained with CO2 supercritical extraction. Solvent free.
1202 2018-08-16 20:57:29 Always a pleasure, Frank!! Your last oil painting was impressive, and actually your watercolor artwork (hated or not) as well. :)) 
1203 2018-08-16 20:57:26 Human's aren't kind, they are the most dangerous things on this planet !  Why would anyone subject themselves to this?  why were they even there? Islam is human scum, absolute power corrupts absolutely so why wouldn't their oil money corrupt them absolutely ?
1204 2018-08-16 20:57:21 Or a vat of hot oil  lol
1205 2018-08-16 20:57:17 I swear, customers stay testing my fuckin gangsta at my shop... “I got an oil change and my windows don’t work now.. you guys are responsible” LIKE WHAT MY GUY!? #fuckouttahereantmuriale
1206 2018-08-16 20:57:11 Honestly, certain life choices require sacrifices. Reality is harsh like that.

Though I imagine if you used enough product the amount of oil in your hair would keep the water out.
1207 2018-08-16 20:57:06 We know how it works. I don't have time for all that honestly
1208 2018-08-16 20:56:48 You already missed out on 150% gains because of “not willing to risk...”
Maybe making epic % gains on the best undiscovered CBD Oil stock isn’t your thing.
See you at $.10 in September
CANB is the next CVSI
$CANB $CVSI $POTN
1209 2018-08-16 20:56:47 I hate the "fresh oil and chips" they put on roads. It's like the construction workers use the laziest method possible to fix road issues, and because you have to drive on it, your car gets dinged up from flying stones.
1210 2018-08-16 20:56:43 ugh i’m thriving eating spaghetti squash w olive oil and drinking water. depression who?
1211 2018-08-16 20:56:37 Let’s see how much this oil change and transmission fluid is 
1212 2018-08-16 20:56:33 is the cafe still open Saturdays?
1213 2018-08-16 20:56:07 I bought magnolia oil from pep. A lot of people recommend it. I’m going to try be patient with it. Apparently it does take time to show results
1214 2018-08-16 20:56:02 Haha , I remember people using baby oil yikes
1215 2018-08-16 20:56:00 "If I break your heart na oil spillage"
1216 2018-08-16 20:55:42 .....but not going bankrupt. Stock is at 335 right now. Not bad, people hate success. Btw, why do we subsidize oil companies?
1217 2018-08-16 20:55:38 Yes,Ba hustle sosai

1222 2018-08-16 20:55:06 Probably not in most of Hyde County though
1223 2018-08-16 20:54:59 You should learn more about Venezuela. The only one who is stealing the wealth of Venezuela is China and Russia. US is the only one who pays cash for the oil. Go educate yourself.

1225 2018-08-16 20:54:43 Andrew is the greatest .Never mentions 30$ discount on Cdn oil or carbon price fixed to EE. We need him to head a faculty of Foolology. We need to train more Gores and Suzuki. Leaving way to much $$ on the table
1226 2018-08-16 20:54:33 Street in bright, thick oil paints.
1227 2018-08-16 20:54:11 I hate getting oil changes
1228 2018-08-16 20:54:01 What about companies in the east? What if it is much cheaper for them to buy oil products from closer American oil companies than from western Canada? Why should such companies buy Canadian oil if it is much more expensive for them? 
1229 2018-08-16 20:53:59 Probably too late but milk works, olive oil & alcohol (all separately.) But this is only based on the one time I rubbed lotion on myself after cutting jalapeños.. Lololol!!
1230 2018-08-16 20:53:42 I have to settle for ultra matte face bc halfway through the day I'm leaking oil out of my pores and it's like I didn't put on makeup
1231 2018-08-16 20:53:41 You are terrorist if you dont share your oil with usa hahahahha America is losing power your empire is going down China and Russia will take you down good bye uncle sam
1232 2018-08-16 20:53:31 What I learnt today is that there’s concerns over Crude Oil’s excess supply which has lead to short term bearish market sentiment. 

Demand has decreased due to the US-China trade war and the weakness in the Turkish Lira which has lost about 45% of its value this year.
1233 2018-08-16 20:53:12 What crude oil production/ day was the budget based on and what is the production volume today?
1234 2018-08-16 20:53:05 The Italian stores on #yyc all carry them in oil. That’s what I prefer so I always pick some up when I’m at any kind of European grocery store.
1235 2018-08-16 20:53:00 Ever notice how every beach town has the same shops in their mall? Always a shop that sells driftwood, an olive oil shop, a shop that sells crystals, a shop that sells paintings of birds & that one shop that sells sweatpants that have the beach on the leg & Life is Good hats.
1236 2018-08-16 20:52:52 True story: I first learned about people wanting to use nukes for fracking from my Dad, an oil and gas reservoir engineer. For the record, he spoke of it with absolute wonder that people could be that nuts. It was a weird case of worlds colliding.
1237 2018-08-16 20:52:50 Getting my oil changed, Fox news is on, very hangry, debating having Chinese food delivered to this Hyundai dealership’s waiting room

1242 2018-08-16 20:52:36 Oh! Precious, do tell how the oil is going to be transported to and from the Hudson's Bay (thru Churchill) when the only rail line to get there is broken? Magic? Balloon? Moose-drawn sled?

1246 2018-08-16 20:51:28 I start by spraying my hair with water or a with a water/oil/conditioner mixture, then I go in with Cantu leave in conditioner. After that, I’ll go in with a curling custard and/or styling gel (I use Cantu or Taliah Waajid products).
1247 2018-08-16 20:51:22 I did ground turkey burgers mixed with cilantro, Worcestershire, ketchup, bread crumbs, egg, salt, pepper, and a little canola oil. I cooked it in my air fryer. They were delicious. Better than a burger I thought. I'll get some deer meat from a buddy and do the same.
1248 2018-08-16 20:51:21 Interesting rns from #iog today - two of their contractors have opted to be compensated exclusively in IOG shares. Bullish behaviour from the insiders. Very excited for the news in the next 6-8 weeks regarding funding and fdp approval. Transformational times ahead #oil #northsea
1249 2018-08-16 20:51:17 It's belly pork. Marinated in olive oil, balsamic, honey, thyme, @HendoRelish and then cooked at 100/bottom left Aga for 4 hours. Green stuff steamed 5 mins.

Haven't done this in months smh
1258 2018-08-16 20:50:15 Know what else changed in past 30 years?  Our understanding of the dangers associated with burning fossil fuels.  Also we accumulated quite a bit of information from numerous catastrophic oil spills.  But thankfully, we found alternatives!
1259 2018-08-16 20:50:14 How have I worked in the AC all day but my face is still covered in oil wtf

1265 2018-08-16 20:49:18 In the 80s my older sister and her friends used to put cooking oil on their skin 
I went the other way and avoided the sun to be pale and goth lol.

1271 2018-08-16 20:48:43 So it's true ppl actually park their vehicles to trek. Nah mehnn Arewa ya bata ni. I cnt survive in Lag.
1272 2018-08-16 20:48:40 Compraste futuros del OIL o lo miras de afuera?
1273 2018-08-16 20:48:39 Unheard stuff: Govt/CM releases security updates two hours past midnight. Well-oiled machinery burns the midnight oil. And media, the watch dog, still on live!
1274 2018-08-16 20:48:35 I don't like this Lagos again. It's too stressful
1275 2018-08-16 20:47:59 I thought y’all said tea tree oil get rid of acne scars? It’s not doing shit for mines, but I’ll keep trying.
1276 2018-08-16 20:47:56 One thing that burns my chest is the price of vegetable oil. I knew when it was 800,1200. Now the biggest size of mamador is almost 2500. Don't think I'll ever wrap my head around it 
1277 2018-08-16 20:47:54 I can't wait to oil paint again
1278 2018-08-16 20:47:52 Should see a lot more volume over the next days/weeks guys. Low free float will have this motoring north very fast once the oil shows and the FOMO herd arrive. This will easily see 20-30p in no time. Super excited and can’t wait for @angloafricanog to update us all the way #AAOG
1279 2018-08-16 20:47:51 Wow that cat call you did.. you need to go find @Ocasio2018 I hear she’s into that..
1280 2018-08-16 20:47:30 National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) is one agency. During the Iraq build up many people all over the political spectrum smelled bullshit. We went after Iraq for the OIL, not OBL. Osama Bin Laden was in Afghanistan, not Iraq. It was one agency, not 17. But thanks for playing.
1281 2018-08-16 20:47:29 Please don't quote that bitch Thatcher (who I met on more than one occasion) at me I served in the British Army when she was PM she used the tax revenue from Scotland's Oil production to subsidize her assaults on the British working class and her name is an insult in Scotland
1282 2018-08-16 20:47:14 Hey @LidlUK where does the palm oil come from in your own brand products?! I’d love to know as I hope it’s from a renewable source & not a place that is destroying animal habitats.
1283 2018-08-16 20:47:03 Helps get smooth and oil free skin: Beat one egg-white until stiff w/ lemon juice. Apply on your skin for 20 mins. Rinse w/ lukewarm water.
1284 2018-08-16 20:47:02 I trekked today from airport ,mad traffic ehn plus I was fasting n tired.
Lagos is overrated
1285 2018-08-16 20:47:02 That'll be the exports the US sees - paid in dollars. 
Fortunately China is now buying Iranian oil - lots of it - and paying in yuan.
1286 2018-08-16 20:47:00 The Hill's are alive with 'Snake Oil Salesmen'!
1287 2018-08-16 20:46:49 we missed an opportunity in the 1970s when the oil crisis hit, the US should have worked harder on mass transit. I seldom hold Europe up as a model but their mass transit system works.
1288 2018-08-16 20:46:47 At some point, we occasionally have to ignore the ignorant.
1289 2018-08-16 20:46:47 Those appear to be high pressure service railcars, and would not be used to haul oil. #MYTHBUSTED
1290 2018-08-16 20:46:25 Peppermint oil will keep them away. It has to be natural peppermint oil and also, ya know maybe they just want to peek.
1291 2018-08-16 20:46:24 Read the whole story. Problem with the US approach: they view it from a military perspective. Our gear vs theirs. Iran views it from an economic perspective. Shutting off 30% of the world oil supply=global recession. Being at war they would not care less!
1292 2018-08-16 20:46:21 Commodities markets stabilize as fears about an economic crisis in Turkey , pulling every thing from copper to oil prices lower

1298 2018-08-16 20:45:52 Your inability to understand basic laws of supply and demand of labor, advocating amnesty, open borders and unlimited immigration,  dont inspire confidence in comprehension of overall macro economics or proposals
1299 2018-08-16 20:45:47 Or bridge connecting cross river to Cameroon,building a refinery in Kastina to service oil wells in Chad but no refinery in SE that has oil wells etc.I am not from SE but I believe an injustice to one is to all.I also believe in one Nigeria where d regions work at their own pace.

our federal government is spending $7 billion to nationalize an oil pipeline that goes through BC

1323 2018-08-16 20:41:48 Your responses defy reason & fail to acknowledge that these lands carry 1.5M for-profit, non-native cattle. There're fewer than 100k horses. There is no comparison of the impact on land. That these lands are desired by ranchers & oil interests announces the agenda.

1326 2018-08-16 20:41:31 my skin started to crawl at the thought of my bare foot stepping on a spider or one crawling on me >:p Also peppermint oil helps keep spiders away.
1327 2018-08-16 20:41:26 Fish oil vitamins taste like how the gardening section at Home Depot smells.

1346 2018-08-16 20:39:26 Sustainability is easy to understand. In my role as an advisor to a major oil company my message was that "Sustainability is Inevitable".
We simply need to be prepared to live with it. We do have an opportunity to have an impact on that inevitability.
1347 2018-08-16 20:39:24 Humanity's a failed experiment, walking the path to extinction.

1366 2018-08-16 20:37:25 The government should be subsidizing the oil sands, it’s the biggest enviromental clean up in the world.  Do you realize that oil just seaps into the rivers?  Clean up the oil sands before sucking oil out of Saudi Arabia’s wells
1367 2018-08-16 20:37:08 Lush propagates itself as a company that’s environmentally conscious, natural, and ‘green’ or whatever but they continuously put sulfates, parabens, artificial fragrances/color, talc, palm oil, and plastic/hydrocarbon derived oils in their dumbass products.
1368 2018-08-16 20:37:04 My non cooking aunt used to use the pancake batter in the waffle iron & be wondering why it would stick and crumble. Even yelled at me when i put the required 1/4c of oil in to fix the batter. She ain’t say shit after they came out perfect.

1382 2018-08-16 20:34:55 Under Obama, the economy never exceeded 2% growth, and they said it never would. The coal industry nearly died, manufacturing vacated the US en masse, and not a single oil refinery was built in 8 years. So the "growth" you are touting was merely a growth in pure delusion.

1408 2018-08-16 20:32:09 @KTHopkins try oil of Olay...in fact try anything
1409 2018-08-16 20:32:06 @nanoShellUK So what you sent me is black. And cost me 7 liters of oil. It is not authentic carbon 60. I haven't heard any response about my request for reimbursement for this loss and I've asked - politely - via email 3 times.
1410 2018-08-16 20:31:53 Ayatollah Trita, they are oligarchy of Iran, backed by IRGC smugglers, in Iran we dont have enough food because of Ayatollahs who are stealing oil money to feed terrorism in middle east while feeding these oligarchy families! Shiitte Ayatollahs made Iran another Soviet Union
1411 2018-08-16 20:31:53 Gotta go get an oil change after work, and I just want to go home and have a drink 
1412 2018-08-16 20:31:50 Exactly. Rub plenty oil on their face then say "glow up" lool
1413 2018-08-16 20:31:42 Finally found some time zu clean/ oil my ankle boots and chaps  It's not like I wanted to do this for weeks... 
1414 2018-08-16 20:31:37 Seriously? I saw the Stones perform only a couple of months ago, running around like men half their age wish they could. They're all in great shape! I think Mick sleeps in a vat of cod-liver oil or something.
1415 2018-08-16 20:31:29 Old will is feeling a bit sick right now and beginning to realise that the snake oil he bought at the great £350 a week lottery is actually making him ill.
1416 2018-08-16 20:31:21 #ShareYourRejection #Undesirable
Some oil sands potato head rejected my viewpoint on #NoKinderMorgan because he couldn't connect delivering a questionable product to market twice as fast as being something undesirable?
1417 2018-08-16 20:31:17 They are all out in West Texas right now with their fake documents getting hired on by Oil Companies as Sand Truck drivers no drivers license but who cares right? Until they run over a small car with a family of a Mother & her 3 children cop has to tell the father they R all dead
1418 2018-08-16 20:30:55 No but i had 2% of oil life left in my car  so it was basically almost black
1419 2018-08-16 20:30:52 Oh true oil 
1420 2018-08-16 20:30:50 Because two under-utilized refineries in the US were refitted for heavy oil.
1421 2018-08-16 20:30:35 I can offer to help, but my skill set may not help you chill & refresh. 
Basic DIY has built my house over 25years! Massarge, music , oil is an option requires seeing flesh! 
Or its a ltr of Vodka and a emotive Movie  which will make your eyes glint.
1422 2018-08-16 20:30:31 In all fairness, will likely never make a tuna sandwich with mayo again after having savored ventresca in olive oil.

1424 2018-08-16 20:30:16 @juliemason The story of food in America is boomers and now millennials coming to worship what what was peasant food in The old country. Example: hunks of Italian bread dipped in olive oil. Now avocado toast. God’s wrath upon those create a guacamole shortage
1425 2018-08-16 20:30:09 i get so sad when i see vegans who cook oil free or oil free vegan recipes like GIRL plant food is already so low in fat?? hello where else you gonna get your healthy fats unless you eat coconut daily

1427 2018-08-16 20:29:57 10 minutos tentando entender o que significa オリーブオイル e depois de desistir e procurar no livro eu descubro que é azeite (oriibu oiru = oliver oil). Katakana às vezes é mais complicado do que Kanji
1428 2018-08-16 20:28:48 Completely understand!! I just think more research has to be done to see which CBD oil is best for you and what potency. Bc tho it minimized my anxiety issues, it still remained. The one I used, did not help one bit with my off and on depression tho

1430 2018-08-16 20:28:27 my life is in shambles because I don’t have any fuckiNG OLIve oiL
1431 2018-08-16 20:28:25 Decided to pay for this massage chair at the mall to pass time while my car gets and oil change and of course the trashiest family sits next to me 
1432 2018-08-16 20:27:57 Origin Energy says it has boosted underlying full-year profit 110% as it reaped the benefits of higher electricity and oil prices and higher power and LNG output. The company swung to a statutory net profit of $218m in 2017-18, from a $2.23bn loss. #solarpanels #privatisation
1433 2018-08-16 20:27:46 who the fuck runs out of olive oil. me.
1434 2018-08-16 20:27:42 Hi.
Who wants to deliver some oil down to my house..
Thanks,  love you forever 
1435 2018-08-16 20:27:40 i think i’d be dead without my glasses i was about to drink a cup of oil instead of apple juice
1436 2018-08-16 20:27:36 Keep u a mixed bottle to the side.  Olive oil with castor oil and peppermint oil. (Rosemary oil is a good growth oil too). Mix it all up and leave it on your counter. Girl. Ur never gonna wanna buy another “growth oil” mix again.
1437 2018-08-16 20:27:31 When I cook them I always rub a little oil in/on my bowl/plate. When I'm done I also always soak said dish before washing it. No dishwasher here. Good luck! 
1438 2018-08-16 20:27:20 Spill continued...Crews responded about 1:30 p.m. An unknown vehicle spilled approx. 20 gallons of oil. NNFD contained the spill, and a private contractor was called. The spill is expected to be cleared up in about an hour.
1439 2018-08-16 20:27:09 i love having a new car until i need an oil change, new brakes, & new tires all at once 
1440 2018-08-16 20:26:40 I must be dumb, I thought that stuff used oil - must be fairy pixie dust. I think Justin supplies that.

1445 2018-08-16 20:25:54 Ontario loves their microdosing of car vape in traffic jam & oil leaks going down the sewer drain. Hopefully breaking deals don't bankrupt the taxpayers worse than those gas prices. #ElonMusk won't be buying @fordnation buck a beer. Money would be better used buying me an acre eh
1446 2018-08-16 20:25:45 That stuff made with palm oil right ?
1447 2018-08-16 20:25:34 My friend's mom had a knee problem - Hemp Oil resolved it - my sister was suffering with knee problems - Help Oil did the trick -
1448 2018-08-16 20:25:30 I'll call them low when I can get a quart of oil for .69.  And gas for $1.10 per gallon.  Not really that long ago.
1449 2018-08-16 20:25:29 @Tontolet does your nose smell like hot oil
1450 2018-08-16 20:25:03 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
1451 2018-08-16 20:24:56 So I can replace the Woodstock patty with an @ImpossibleFoods burger, leave off the cheese and basil garlic aioli? How about your fries? Cooked in a vegetable oil? Oil not used for anything else?
1452 2018-08-16 20:24:52 Also try salmon oil. Dogs like smelly things so he might eat it.
1453 2018-08-16 20:24:49 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt.
1454 2018-08-16 20:24:22 How do I watch it again as missed first part? It’s fab xx I’m going to make huge effort to avoid palm oil and make a point of telling others are Cadbury’s
1455 2018-08-16 20:24:12 light white shirt which hangs open to reveal my very defined muscles. I rub a bit of oil on my abs and chest to let the light shine off my skin. I then fix my hair with some wax. I turn to look at you, hands on hips and thumbs hooked under my waistband* I'm ready, are you?
1456 2018-08-16 20:24:10 Does it go city were shit, along came an oil mogul, spent billions of his own money to obtain success? Yeah like I’d watch this crap
1457 2018-08-16 20:24:04 Has any used CBD oil and if so what’s your faults??
1458 2018-08-16 20:23:38 Got new tires and an oil change, adulting at it’s finest
1459 2018-08-16 20:23:25 I had TERRIBLE #restlesslegsyndrome for ages-i forgot what it felt like to live w/o the incessant need to kick my legs. here's what helped:

1461 2018-08-16 20:23:21 Why it’s a vape ? No it’s got cannabis oil in OK that’s me done for the night
1462 2018-08-16 20:23:15 Pain is really bad today. I managed to gather and wash the herbs, get sage oil and a holy basil tincture going, run to Aldi for cheese, make pesto, get the broth reduced a bit and put up in the freezer, and clean out much of my hanging rack. I have to start dinner soon, too.
1463 2018-08-16 20:22:52 @Tigerwritertv Need some advice. My beard has gotten to the, "Okay, you can stop shaving your neck now" length and as the resident best beard I feel you're the right guy to ask. Any recos for decent but affordable beard oil?
1464 2018-08-16 20:22:39 I suspect the "big oil" lobby! 
1465 2018-08-16 20:22:33 Get some neem oil and other essential oils like lavender and mix it. Neem oil smells but mixed with other oils it’s not bad. No insects will ever touch you
1466 2018-08-16 20:22:31 Good article. Considering the number of trawlers attempting to encroach on 500m zones, they must know fish are shoaling around the jackets. The oil industry needs to work with @GreenpeaceUK to ensure clean jackets are retained in place to support marine life.

1473 2018-08-16 20:21:14 My grandma gave me an (unworn) pack of Hanes underwear that she didn’t like and as if that wasn’t embarrassing enough I had to carry it walking into an oil change place to pick up my car 
1474 2018-08-16 20:21:02 Bby oil
1475 2018-08-16 20:21:02 It’s getting done this weekend after I get this oil change
1476 2018-08-16 20:20:53 Then she uses a mixture of oils to seal. ( olive oil,jojoba oil,sweet almond oil,castor oil, avocado oil)
1477 2018-08-16 20:20:51 I was in the tunnel, lol.  Seriously, just hours away from dying.  It’s kind of a funny story...my husband really wanted to change the oil on the car...I just wanted to sleep...but he decided to take me to the ER.  Spent the next week in ICU getting emergency blood transfusions.

1482 2018-08-16 20:20:24 I can never keep a car long enough to get the 7th oil change for free
1483 2018-08-16 20:20:16 We just got some itchy dog balm today that has those in it! Now I'm licking a little coconut oil and wearing the balm. :D
1484 2018-08-16 20:20:10 Every Christian loves singing Jehovah Jireh God is my provider bla bla bla but only the anointing oil creates lasting wealth. How did the perfect ministry of Jesus Christ work? Luke says by many people donating to him out of their personal means! (See Luke 8:3)
1485 2018-08-16 20:20:09 Monky I’m so glad the CBD oil works so well for you. It’s part of my cannabis regiment too. Truly a miracle for so many of us. Damn greedy big pharma can bite me.
1486 2018-08-16 20:19:47 Interesting that a lot of those countries making big investments in renewables consume less oil products on per capita basis (except NOR & DEU ). China consumed 0.4 gal oil per day per capita last year, Brazil 0.5 & Mexico 0.6. That compares to U.S: 2.6 gal oil/day/capita in 17.
1487 2018-08-16 20:19:35 "fell into a vat of oil"

1495 2018-08-16 20:18:17 Fucking annnoying that my car is taking this long for an oil change. 
1496 2018-08-16 20:18:13 Legit oil change places are scams
1497 2018-08-16 20:18:08 .@Tesco what’s even worse is that you simply don’t need palm oil to make pastry of any sort.
1498 2018-08-16 20:18:03 I got fed cannabis oil don’t talk to me about the line
1499 2018-08-16 20:18:03 so many more things that haven’t even been discussed at all... medical, automotive industry, technology, manufacturing, real estate, civil engineering, oil industry, energy, food,agriculture etc... it will be a loooong process.  No point in dragging it out once it drops

1508 2018-08-16 20:17:11 .@Tesco. There is no truly sustainable palm oil. If you buy from one good supplier it removes good PO from the supply chain and browns everyone else’s supply

1518 2018-08-16 20:16:08 Ahhh it’s so much better when you do! I like to slice the top off a whole bulb of garlic, drizzle it with oil, wrap it in foil and roast it for 40 mins then all the garlic basically melts and you can squeeze it into your sauce it’s dreamy.
1519 2018-08-16 20:16:06 Polluting with your families bodies? A new low for oil!
1520 2018-08-16 20:16:04 Black American and do you enjoy $2 gas? In eurpoe people pay at least $4 a gallon. The reason it's so cheap in the US is that we have deal with saudi arabia where we get cheap oil and they get to slotter the people of yeman without the US stepping in.

1529 2018-08-16 20:15:21 .@Tesco I worked in Kalimantan Tenga on peat that was burning because of massive deforestation. There is enough peat in Indonesia that, if burned would blow the entire global carbon budget. Palm oil is largely responsible.
1530 2018-08-16 20:15:09 that's fine bc it doesnt look like standard issue SKIN OIL THESE FOOLS
1531 2018-08-16 20:15:09 Refurbs have to be paid for, usually by charging well over £40 a gallon for a water based product. Yet people go to war over oil
1532 2018-08-16 20:14:59 Yup. Reduce Iran's oil exports to zero by November 4th is the plan. Sanction, sanction, sanction.
1533 2018-08-16 20:14:52 Your sarcastic remark does have a good point. Do you value the ability to have the choice to buy free trade? Why should Canadians not have the choice to which oil sources they support?

1536 2018-08-16 20:14:31 Renewable energy is only really a threat to a handful of people who own oil refineries and coal mines. That’s it. Anything else is a lie fed to us by those same billionaires so we keep buying their primitive technology. 

Why is this still a thing?
1537 2018-08-16 20:14:28 How about they examine the energy efficiency of oil?  Or of settling using fiat and people?
1538 2018-08-16 20:14:24 Yea and if it wasn't for the NDP tax increases and the liberal carbon tax and anti pipeline stance those oil field works would still be employed and have no need for EI. But not to worry Premier Kenney will fix the NDP mess next spring
1539 2018-08-16 20:14:16 triste pq meu oil acabou 
1540 2018-08-16 20:14:07 Olive oil and a few drops peppermint oil is my hot oil treatment! If I’m taking down a protective style and i feel my hair is super dry. I add in black castor.
1541 2018-08-16 20:13:47 Break it in??? You haven't hit that yet?!! Me and @TommiesMommy14 are very disappointed in you  Been hitting oil, I miss flower....but you know these prices in California, I am just trying to keep my head in the clouds, sort to speak haha
1542 2018-08-16 20:13:46 Uhhh i just learned how to change the oil in a truck????

1547 2018-08-16 20:12:58 where's the @GovernmentZA in all this,you guys have been posting everything fake we consume in our daily lifes i.e Soft drinks ,bread, lotions,cooking oil ect ect
but have never seen them comment or take action against these dealers
1548 2018-08-16 20:12:35 Hi sweetie! I take CBD Oil and it has helped my anxiety! I have been taking it since March and I'm almost off all my anxiety meds! I love CBD Oil!
1549 2018-08-16 20:12:32 SEC is which is now controlled by Trump and thus Russia would love nothing better then to destroy Tesla so Big Oil will win. How do you like being agent of Russia.

1551 2018-08-16 20:11:33 1:1 CBD to thc ratio of high dose oil/edibles/suppositories works for many stage 3-4 patients. Think 500 mg CBD, 500 mg THC.
1552 2018-08-16 20:11:25 Tell him IF he can do margarine, earth balance is bomb. I'm a big toast fiend, so I could see missing butter being a thing if I didnt have earth balance. Olive oil is actually pretty good on veggies and popcorn too! But some ppl can't do oily foods at all so idk!
1553 2018-08-16 20:11:10 The world’s most valuable resource is no longer oil, but data.
1554 2018-08-16 20:11:03 Since the matter is being discussed, let me take the opportunity to double-check: @gerberKawasaki is not a parody account, right? He really believes on the narrative he outlines despite all of its inconsistencies like on/off on big oil conspiracies, etc., right?
1555 2018-08-16 20:10:52 Thank God someone with some knowledge is actually addressing this point. The imbroglio with SA has brought out the "Cdn oil for Cdns dummies." It's economically illiterate populism. The best oil for Cda is the cheapest we can get.
1556 2018-08-16 20:10:49 I have a 2006 Toyota Highlander Hybrid @ 205,640 miles I had purchased $27,425.02 in just gas! Same miles driven in a Model 3 @ $0.13/kWh would cost ~$9,000.00!  Oil changes 42 @ $60 = $2,520. EV savings ~$20,945.00 or $0.10/mi & no pollution as I buy wind generation.

1563 2018-08-16 20:10:01 Try baked broccoli! It doesn’t leave it with that overpowering flavor, it leaves it crisp and fresh. Toss a head (or however much) in a tiny bit of olive oil, salt, pepper & nature seasoning if you have it. Bake it for like 10-15 i swear it’s broccoli life changing

1576 2018-08-16 20:08:47 Needed an oil change
1577 2018-08-16 20:08:40 UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES should any oil or gas company be allowed to drill anywhere near FLorida's coastline.We rely on beaches, tourism & beauty of our state. We cannot allow that to be taken away. BP oil spill did too much damage. Learn from mistakes.We don't need more oil wells.
1578 2018-08-16 20:08:26 SHELL is diversifying out of oil products... into clean energy, maybe Tesla investor?
1579 2018-08-16 20:08:20 The White one! The argan oil one straight too
1580 2018-08-16 20:08:14 Your comment still doesn't  make any sense. The pipeline isn't slowing down oil production it's just diverting sales.
1581 2018-08-16 20:08:04 Getting an oil change is so stressful because they try to upsell literally everyyyything
1582 2018-08-16 20:07:54 Jason Kenney's oil monomania is become tiresome in the extreme.
1583 2018-08-16 20:07:50 The amount of oil my face produces is ridiculous. I be looking like a glazed donut all the time and not in a delicious way. If anyone has any suggestions for a homegirls issues lmk

1587 2018-08-16 20:07:26 There is nothing they contribute to my life that allows me to survive no food power water or land from there helps me in anyway,sure the economy there helps us have an amazing military to keep this nation safe from invasion, we have oil and natural gas also in this state
1588 2018-08-16 20:07:19 I repeatedly loaded the mineral oil from my PCR reactions onto my gels. And then repeated the PCRs multiple times when the gels revealed the reactions "didn't work."
1589 2018-08-16 20:07:18 Wow what the fuck country crocks uses palm oil? Why man
1590 2018-08-16 20:07:09 Depends on ur scalp needs.  Olive and castor oil works the best on my scalp. Olive really the # 1 hair and body oil i use.
1591 2018-08-16 20:06:53 The no bull burgers are the best vegan burgers I’ve tried so far. No palm oil or other crap. Give them a go. Some toasted burger rolls, fried onions, mustard and ketchup. 

Seriously give them a try. I’d be interested in what you think.
1592 2018-08-16 20:06:50 You realize that anyone can write a definition on urban dictionary. I may as well go and define business insider as a "group of people who love suckin big, wrinkly hairy balls of the oil magnates while being paid for it"
1593 2018-08-16 20:06:47 Damn....
The oil in my 2011 Impeza has lasted 97,000 miles.

So far.
1594 2018-08-16 20:06:47 Tires, oil change, and new headlights.  it was only a year and a half over due.
1595 2018-08-16 20:06:43 I’ve got a great story about the final time I had an oil change at the Fargo Hyundai dealership. It’s longer than 280 characters, because it includes more than 280 cuss words.
1596 2018-08-16 20:06:34 For those who don't remember, the "Hands up, don't shoot" was entirely made up by Brown's accomplice. The 7 eyewitnesses (all but one of whom were black) said it did not happen. But media went with the false narrative 24/7 with ZERO confirmation. "Free press," my ass!
1597 2018-08-16 20:06:20 People who paint with oil paint have my fullest respect
1598 2018-08-16 20:06:06 A booking for Michelle in Westbury this afternoon. Seemed to go well, left my oil bottle warmer behind....an all too often occurrence. lol.
1599 2018-08-16 20:06:04 i found out you got to put alot of oil in the pan i used to burn all my food
1600 2018-08-16 20:05:58 You can definitely untangle fine chains by dipping cotton bud in olive oil. Use it to paint on the knot and it will slide undone easily.
1601 2018-08-16 20:05:54 Hey Spooky! I actually worked as a medical professional in an emergency room and we’d see this all the time, people coming in with check pain and getting worked up as cardiac. Anxiety is a serious condition, hemp oil extract amazing at making it melt away!i use it for the same!
1602 2018-08-16 20:05:52 Easier said then done.  Light sweet crude is the easiest to refine and makes the most profit.   You would need Irving Oil’s shareholders to agree...and when you start taking money from dividends and profits...good luck.
1603 2018-08-16 20:05:39 Remember listening  to the L60 power pack wine and groan  during launching from a 4 RTR Recce Tp CVRT. Many launched is a fog of oil and  diesel smoke, with VM’s near by.

1615 2018-08-16 20:03:44 So its an addiction now?
I see opportunities for snake oil merchants lobbying for federal grants to build and staff clinics across the country providing "17 step therapy" to food stamp addicts.
1616 2018-08-16 20:03:40 I just put castor oil on my face. My beard feels thicker already 
1617 2018-08-16 20:03:34 When you say unaffordable energy, i assume that means clean energy. Well, in the long term, renewable energy like solar or wind will be much cheaper. Just need to hop initial hurdles.
Additionally, the C02 that coal and oil makes poison air and water. That leads to suffering too.

1619 2018-08-16 20:02:56 We have two models ..one says 320 ..one says 400 ...so mid-way between the two (360) seems reasonable, especially with oil price around 70

1633 2018-08-16 20:01:30 For 2017, Canada's light oil exports were at their lowest in 5 yrs, and the average value captured by those exports was, $50.72 about $0.23 per barrel below WTI. The average cost of Saudi crude imported to NB was $58.80/bbl. Energy East tolls would be well higher than that diff.
1634 2018-08-16 20:01:25 Black Seed Oil is a fucking gem!
1635 2018-08-16 20:01:22 It’s up to us to keep building the mass movement that will turn all of these pipelines into stranded assets. Big oil will cease investing the moment they believe our triumph is inevitable. They do not believe yet. Organizing is the only way to make them believe.

1638 2018-08-16 20:00:40 Trump has been harder on Russia than Obama ever was. Remember those 500 Russians annihilated in Syria by US forces? Increased military spending to the EDI, sending lethal weapons to Ukraine, sanctions on Russian oligarchs & government officials, and by expanding our own gas/oil.

1644 2018-08-16 20:00:07 Back a few generations ago the Valleys were famous across the world Dan, but once oil took over that was it and the reputation went into decline from the 1930’s.

1646 2018-08-16 20:00:01 With all of the students back at school now, we must make sure that we don’t forget the contribution of over $711 million from the oil and gas industry to the K-12 public education system in this state.

1649 2018-08-16 19:59:38 This week was so productive. Going to get an oil changed now then a wax & home to d my homework
1650 2018-08-16 19:59:34 Sure. If selling a quart of oil to someone and saying, “Yup, that’s about all she needs; then that engine’ll start purrin’ in no time flat,” is “being cool.”

1654 2018-08-16 19:59:17 I think this all goes back to the money-for-oil/govt spending that G. H. W. Bush made with the Saudis during the oil crisis of the early 70s.  We got in bed with the Saudis because we needed then to finance our profligate spending, and we're still bedmates.
1655 2018-08-16 19:59:15 @VaticanNews  Pope Francis should check on a Holy Bible that is leaking oil of unknown origin in Dalton, Georgia USA.

1665 2018-08-16 19:57:38 What nonsense! Oil workers may have used the EI program to help pay bills after being laid off but so has anyone else in Canada who has lost their job. Oil workers don’t “love” it, they would much rather be working and able to support their families. EI doesn’t come close to that

1676 2018-08-16 19:56:27 It was phenomenal! I loved her passionate rendition of Midnight Oil's "Beds Are Burning." In case you're interested, Tuesday's show has been recorded, and it was hands down the best of the 3 shows.
1677 2018-08-16 19:56:12 Seems legit....
1678 2018-08-16 19:55:48 I changed the filter and the oil and it went off the next day. 
1679 2018-08-16 19:55:34 After pumping 2 billion into a ‘meal’ I’d be pretty fucking fuming if there wasn’t a ‘desert.’ Small oil club
1680 2018-08-16 19:55:30 Nails done , toes done , eye brows threaded, oil changed , and got my baby a few outfits   my off day been pretty successful
1681 2018-08-16 19:55:22 Mannn they don’t understand what they missing out on. He said it tasted like oil, like an industrial city, the worst thing ever like it was just a California roll?!! It’s so many more options
1682 2018-08-16 19:55:21 These oil companies really testing me today. I’m not a fkn miracle worker!! But ima still try to come thru for you boo bc I need your money.
1683 2018-08-16 19:55:06 I live within a kilometer of a wind turbine, solar panels, and an oil pump. The oil pump always works. Even when it is windy the wind turbine is not always running.

 I look forward to a post-oil world and understand that oil will help us get there.
1684 2018-08-16 19:54:57 Spent a year and a half of having my arms in a 650°F stand oven with no AC. Also had to get a Homeland Security clearance so I could get up at 5am, make 250 mini pizzas, and drive a shitty little box truck full of said pizzas into the local oil refinery at lunch time.
1685 2018-08-16 19:54:56 A9 Dear Future College Student, Please learn how to a) change the toilet paper roll b) do your laundry c) fill your gas tank d) check your oil and e) take great notes BEFORE you get to college! #WBChat #AmericaValuesCollege
1686 2018-08-16 19:54:33 Yep. I do oil & vinegar. When it gets bad, I pull out my secrect weapons #Avocados #HiddenValleyRanch, #Hummus. Something tasty, fatty, wth a good mouth feel makes eating a salad easier. Most salad bars have huge vats of dressing so people just gulp their greens & rainbows down
1687 2018-08-16 19:54:10 He's trying to warn you about all the rats in DC.
But he's willing to watch your back if you still want to go in.
1688 2018-08-16 19:54:05 I'm feeling really attacked right now. But I can take it...because I use Today's Mug Beard Oil.
1689 2018-08-16 19:53:54 In summary, the quickest and easiest way to reduce our dependency on foreign oil, is to reduce our dependency on oil.
1690 2018-08-16 19:53:49 What shows as BOP failure may very well be 'operator error.' Safety procedures fail all the time when skilled, experienced help is let go and rookies (worms) step on the rig floor. 

And when the oil company just doesn't really give a damn. 

BOP testing protocols very rigorous.
1691 2018-08-16 19:53:21 So do not hesitate to use it as Argan Oil, because it is what it really is. Do not hesitate to contact us if you need further assistance. Best regards.
1692 2018-08-16 19:53:16 Not like you care, but... If you grew it, it's probably mostly carb. If you killed it, probably mostly protein. If it's dairy or oil, mostly fat. There are exceptions to that, but that's mostly how it goes. And agreed on moderation and exercise.
1693 2018-08-16 19:53:15 Interesting. According to this data, SA and Iraq are still 15% of our total imports. If you use this same site, you can look up crude oil by country from 2012-2017. The trends didn’t change much in 2016-2017 versus the prior four years.
1694 2018-08-16 19:52:48 As we got new containers for our Kueshi serum, we didn’t want just to throw the old ones. As a natural and ecological Brand we try to recycle as much as we can. So in order to take advantage of the former containers, we used them for our Naobay Argan Oil.
1695 2018-08-16 19:52:39 I finally found a way to cook it that it actually tastes good. Roast it with a little olive oil, salt and pepper. Same with brussel sprouts, SO GOOD!
1696 2018-08-16 19:52:35 Just close to Ocean oil
1697 2018-08-16 19:52:18 نگی که من بهت گفتم
1698 2018-08-16 19:52:11 Dear Sylvia, we would like to explain you what really happened. What you purchased was really Argan Oil, but we used former containers of our other brand, Kueshi. These containers hadn't been used before, but they already had the brand and the product name printed on it.
1699 2018-08-16 19:52:10 Are you like me? i mean, the the kind of girl who talks about sex and is perverted but is more virgin than extra virgin oil.
1700 2018-08-16 19:51:58 For me it’s usually when I’ve either had a dream about something that triggers my anxiety or something that unsettled me is ongoing. Try using CBD oil before bed that can help x
1701 2018-08-16 19:51:50 @realDonaldTrump Sir did you hear there is a Holy Bible leaking oil of unknown origin in Dalton, Georgia. Healing oil from God?
1702 2018-08-16 19:51:37 If you don’t think non-vegans are short on DHA, you’re mistaken. And if you’re suggesting that taking a algal oil supplement is sufficient ethical justification to participate in mass violence & exploitation, then nothing I say will convince you.
1703 2018-08-16 19:51:31 Me, putting some olive oil in a pan: oh it made a heart
*Olive oil goes in the middle of the heart*

1707 2018-08-16 19:51:10 So true...even Kelloggs cornflakes is now in a sachet, golden morn, quacker oats, vegetable oil, the list goes on. Very interesting revolution for selling. I want to believe the numbers are adding up.

1711 2018-08-16 19:50:37 SOUNDS LIKE EXXONMOBILE HAD BETTER DO THE RIGHT THING AND ACT WITH INTEGRITY AND ACT LEGALLY!!! THE UNITED STATES SHOULD OFFER ASSISTANCE TO INSURE ALL GHANIANS BENEFIT FROM THEIR OIL RESERVES AND CORRUPTION IS ELIMINATED!!!
1712 2018-08-16 19:50:32 BC does not allow Alberta oil so why Alberta is allowing BC Smoke?

1714 2018-08-16 19:50:26 He's not ignoring the Western Slope he's doing the public debate with the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel. I would say that type of forum is closer to the people as opposed to one held by oil and gas controlled groups like Club 20.
1715 2018-08-16 19:50:13 Part of this is (some) parents perpetuate this crap. I.E. sons learn to change the tires and oil, daughters get handed a AAA card and that’s it.

Increased STEM activities have shown that women and minorities can be just as good as white men in technical fields.
1716 2018-08-16 19:50:12 Grate them, press out moisture, mix with feta, Parmesan, lemon zest, mint or parsley, beat in an egg, couple of spoons of flour, shape into balls, drop in very hot oil, couple of minutes, turn couple of minutes and out. Eat!!

1725 2018-08-16 19:49:08 I realized today that 90% of the "butter" you see on shelves isn't even real butter. They all say "vegetable oil spread." Almost all of it is margarine, which is basically plastic.... notice how none of them even say "butter" on the package. Have you noticed this??

1737 2018-08-16 19:47:56 Listened to that part. Nausea has always been my reaction to seed oils, especially when fried, so I'm hardly surprised!

Running it down my throat in a tube never occurred to me , though. 

What happened to Seth Roberts makes me leary about excess olive oil, though...
1738 2018-08-16 19:47:51 That Oil change was needed

1741 2018-08-16 19:47:32 I've praised all efforts 2 reduce GHG emissions. I's a bit rich 4 Alberta 2 argue that oil sands production needs to triple & Transmountain needs to be built in order to have a climate plan. I'm surprised u've become a cheerleader 4 increasing GHGs to reduce them. Politics much?

1748 2018-08-16 19:47:00 Green Beauty Tip: Clean beauty foundations are often oil-based and moisturizing on their own. If you have normal-to-oily skin, skip your moisturizer! It can be too much oil and cause your foundation to separate and not last as long.

1764 2018-08-16 19:45:21 Maybe that’s incentive to get in wars the ppl actually back. If it were another oil grab then sure you’re right, but nothing of value was lost. If it’s a war for survival then the will to survive makes that point moot.

1813 2018-08-16 19:39:44 are you interested in my 10 minutes pie crust with olive oil 
1814 2018-08-16 19:39:37 What is your response to the argument that the US dollar can maintain its value because oil can only be traded using US dollars?
1815 2018-08-16 19:39:25 I use synthetic these days in my van. Not sure if the cheapest vape is any better on the environment than 100% pure cannabis oil.
1816 2018-08-16 19:39:13 راه حل بهتری نداری
1817 2018-08-16 19:38:51 Tea tree oil is really a blessing
1818 2018-08-16 19:38:48 so so sad yet we are producing our own crude oil.cs Rotich belongs to jail.tunataka maandamano
1819 2018-08-16 19:38:43 Getting the use of everyday on hand items is the first Principal for survival especially used in co-vert ops. Like how Snake hides in box’s or in Emptied Oil Drums. Or how the Transformers Disguise themselves as everyday vehicles
1820 2018-08-16 19:38:15 TAKE HIM HOME
1821 2018-08-16 19:38:08 11am today: Never eating bread again. 4pm today: Enters Quay Bakery. 8pm today: Dunking rosemary and walnut bread in garlic dipping oil liberally sprinkled with seasalt  I love food 
1822 2018-08-16 19:37:38 Choking on my oil pen while making conversation with the Uber driver... I love Mexico
1823 2018-08-16 19:37:31 Would go lovely with some chorizo and roasted cod, few burst tomatoes and olive oil...
1824 2018-08-16 19:37:29 Pay me back for that oil change then
1825 2018-08-16 19:37:22 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.  #PSALM 23:5.

Be for you go to bed let us thank God that He does not remove our enemies to bless us. But he prepare the table in their preaence. Be patient you'll eat now.
1826 2018-08-16 19:37:17 So who wants to pick me up while I get an oil change? I’ll feed you
1827 2018-08-16 19:37:04 OPEC are sovereign nations, most of which are heavily indebted. Cannot increase CAPEX spending. 

Government oil Co's are not always the most efficient; they may have a theoretical spare capacity, but then a lower effective one..
1828 2018-08-16 19:36:58 Just realised olive oil comes from olives... 
1829 2018-08-16 19:36:55 Have fun keep her in one piece go #3

1832 2018-08-16 19:36:47 Three slash four cup vegetable oil.
1833 2018-08-16 19:36:32 i attribute it to switching from regular moisturizers to oils, the combo of vitamin e, argan and rosehip oil is dramaticly changing my skin. like at almost 32 the best skin i’ve had in my entire life.
1834 2018-08-16 19:36:22 Social media marketing. Selling you stuff you’re already planning to buy. Snake oil salesmen.
1835 2018-08-16 19:36:12 Spray the bowl with an oil spray or soak with Dawn and very hot water.
1836 2018-08-16 19:36:05 This snake oil salesman needs to go!!!
1837 2018-08-16 19:35:59 I didn’t know that @ntimination also eat oil rice  hehe 
1838 2018-08-16 19:35:41 I wouldn’t make it without candles, incense and my oil diffuser lol.

the ferrari lover is right where it should be  
checking the oil 
1842 2018-08-16 19:35:23 @brian_armstrong  any chance @streamrinc  market place can be added or work together to get it placed up? Data is the new oil buddy  I know to are a visionary work@together to list it on the @CoinbaseWallet
1843 2018-08-16 19:35:16 I hate being an adult, because oil changes are expensive and I’m pissed about it.
1844 2018-08-16 19:34:49 maybe the real oil was the first aid we learned on the way
1845 2018-08-16 19:34:35 Turns out you can get to -15% on your oil level without your car exploding #growingup #residentlife
1846 2018-08-16 19:34:33 Im such a horrible car owner  the worker just came back and told me my oil was damn near empty and it needs more services other than oil change. I said “ok ill come back another time” my car deserves better than me
1847 2018-08-16 19:34:32 yar I have visited every doctor every hakeem(lol) .. thy recommend different oil and different shampoo but nothing works..some say its genetic.
1848 2018-08-16 19:34:26 This man at Kia really asked me if I was interested in the *highly recommend* $600 car maintenance package when I walked in there with a $24.99 oil change coupon
1849 2018-08-16 19:34:22 vape oil. Please I must see
1850 2018-08-16 19:34:14 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
1851 2018-08-16 19:34:06 Maybe check the gas and oil?
1852 2018-08-16 19:33:38 This is coming from a guy that said we should get oil from other countries, right?
1853 2018-08-16 19:33:37 The Lord replied to them: “I am sending you grain, new wine and olive oil, enough to satisfy you fully; never again will I make you an object of scorn to the nations.
Joel 2:19 NIV

Enough to satisfy me fully....... Enough to satisfy my family fully..#FullySatisfied
1854 2018-08-16 19:33:21 Camino vamos de esos 2.3x... Si se acerca a ellos momento de tomar alguna posición o esperar y ver? Medidas acerca de las concesionarias en Italia y precio del oil marcaran su ruta....
1855 2018-08-16 19:33:21 Lets just get on par with oil and gas companies and just give them tax breaks...Whoops it might hurt their bottom line in their foreign investments in solar and wind research...Pretty interesting stuff going on in Saudi Arabia,India,Morocco, Africa with investors from major corps
1856 2018-08-16 19:33:16 Big oil gets MUCH more in tax breaks than Tesla and other green energy companies get in subsidies. Musk has stated many times that he'd be fine cancelling all subsidies today if tax breaks for bid oil companies end as well. (1/2)
1857 2018-08-16 19:33:12 @mrlube what’s an acceptable time for an oil change? Have been sitting here for 30 mins and haven’t even gotten into the bay yet.
1858 2018-08-16 19:33:10 We will have him in the oil n gas field making black gold dollars soon!!
1859 2018-08-16 19:32:55 Been watching #OrangutanJungleSchool and checking up on the #palmoil in the things we buy. It's so hard! @pizzahutuk do you use certified sustainable palm oil? Otherwise we're going to have to stop visiting 
1860 2018-08-16 19:32:51 Snake oil salesman supreme. 

Hypochristian.
1861 2018-08-16 19:32:48 did the ccf ever find that oil
1862 2018-08-16 19:32:39 @GirlsOwn sends love and hope you can be as kind and patient with yourself as you always are to others. The original @GirlsOwn would probably have suggested something horrible like Cod Liver Oil or Good Works.
1863 2018-08-16 19:32:23 Before you say that DHA synthesis from EPA is inefficient & requires a lot of ALA:
1. Ok eat a ton of ALA
2. Take an algal oil supp
3. If you’re going to bemoan supps, then clearly you’re not paying attn to the VAST number taken by non-vegans bc they’re lacking so many nutrients
1864 2018-08-16 19:32:19 Love the Mobile 1 oil!! My car runs, no floats, like a dream!! 
1865 2018-08-16 19:32:06 I was supposed to tidy up today, but instead I cleaned, clipped, filed and buffed my nails, then painted them with argan oil and they're so smooth I can't stop touching them D: I'm sitting here in between piles of clothes and boxes just stroking my nails....
1866 2018-08-16 19:32:04 No. Not really. It is about supply constraints, lack of exploration and depletion.

You seem to be thinking on short-term price catalysts, which are very different from fundamental analysis. Short-term oil prices are a random walk.
1867 2018-08-16 19:31:49 A desperate move now for the oil boys to try & snap up Tesla for cheap before its stock skyrockets.
1868 2018-08-16 19:31:32 “We put you in an oil drum, if the ransoms not paid, we light you on fire.” Loved that movie.
1869 2018-08-16 19:31:16 Sounds similar to mine but I just throw em in the blender and add ginger also. Also gargle sea salt & pop zinc & oregano oil.
1870 2018-08-16 19:31:15 WHAT ARE YOU HIDING?? AS FAR AS UR RELATIONSHIP W JENELLE EASON, IS IT/WAS IT A SEXUAL ONE, DID YOU HARASS HER? OR SUPPLY HER W DRUGS ONE TIME SO SHE'D FILM? SHE'S GOT SOMETHING OVER YOU! THE TRUTH IS LIKE OIL IN WATER, IT ALWAYS COMES TO THE SURFACE
1871 2018-08-16 19:30:59 old ladies can be so stupid but they’re so sweet. So see my problem when one cuts my car in line for an oil  change and i’m heated but she taps on the window to say sorry and that i look like her granddaughter

1873 2018-08-16 19:30:17 The SEC should be investigating Trump & Republicans. For falsely propping up Coal, Oil, & Gas as those Investors sell high to unwind their investments & switch to alternatives & renewables that Trumps administration are purposely trying to devalue.Big oil knows they’re losing!
1874 2018-08-16 19:30:15 i know a chick that bought a car wit a note and blew her engine out cus she never got the oil changed...changed my opinion of her
1875 2018-08-16 19:30:10 Fish oil e teng 
1876 2018-08-16 19:29:59 Your wcw’s change oil light came on in her car, she texted her dad and told him to go change it then she tweeted “ugh I’m so tired of adulting”
1877 2018-08-16 19:29:56 hope there's oil involved
1878 2018-08-16 19:29:47 The problem you have here is that the same jolly corrupt people in Westminster moved the Nautical Border between Scotland and England from Berwick to Aberdeen, taking in the North Sea Oil Wells. 

Do not ask us to accept anything published by the UK Government.
1879 2018-08-16 19:29:37 Lagi2 smlm try nk minum kopi nk check whether can stay awake. End up tido jugak after few hours.  Thanks fam!! Insha Allah! Dah burn dah midnight oil hahaha!
1880 2018-08-16 19:29:36 I wonder if those are the same algos that keep ignoring plunging oil product demand #oott
1881 2018-08-16 19:29:26 Went in for an oil change ended up spending $220 
1882 2018-08-16 19:29:19 So yesterday my mom was completely wiped out by 2 waves and today she went flying on some oil in my apartment, cannot deal with her 
1883 2018-08-16 19:29:15 @waitrose Why is it more and more of your products contain Palm oil? Even something as simple as bread rolls? We all know that the production of Palm oil is destroying our rain forests. It is the cheapest dirtiest fat you could use, Shame on you! Your standards are slipping!
1884 2018-08-16 19:29:11 Think my flux capacitor needs an oil change
1885 2018-08-16 19:29:11 Greed and corruption from a temporary oil boom and inept leadership destroyed Venezuela, not true Socialism. The word has been so twisted in American politics, it's become a meaningless right wing rhetoric to incite fear and ignorance.
1886 2018-08-16 19:29:10 No, I don't think Dawn dish soap will help you with your oily hair, regardless of what it does for those penguins after oil spills.
1887 2018-08-16 19:29:08 SURVEY:  Have you ever tried CBD oil??  If not....have you thought about trying it??  

Comment “tried” or “want” below.....
1888 2018-08-16 19:29:07 The destroyer USS John S. McCain collided with an oil tanker in coastal waters off Singapore in August 2016, killing 10 U.S. sailors.
1889 2018-08-16 19:29:06 getting my oil changed and my dealership has a theatre and a gaming center. wtf
1890 2018-08-16 19:28:55 Rev 6:6 And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and [see] thou hurt not the oil and the wine.
1891 2018-08-16 19:28:53 It was looking appealing until I saw palm oil listed. #NoNeed
1892 2018-08-16 19:28:46 When will we finish paying such debts. Hope APC is not thinking of debt forgiveness again. What about internally generated revenue from the sale of crude oil? Where is the money going?
1893 2018-08-16 19:28:43 Going on hour one and a half of watching my car not get an oil change yet.
1894 2018-08-16 19:28:43 We could also stop discounting the oil to be fair.
1895 2018-08-16 19:28:22 Just salt and sesame oil
1896 2018-08-16 19:28:18 olive oil ?
1897 2018-08-16 19:28:15 Correct. Oil is a volatile commodity. Westminster saw us through the last downturn. There will certainly be another and another downturn. Who would then see us through if we rejected UK?
1898 2018-08-16 19:28:09 They do look a lot younger, tbh.  But they seem to be very well-beloved, so, though I've got one foot in the grave and the other on a slick of oil, I shall no doubt appreciate their talent!  xxx

Big Ups, brother man.
1901 2018-08-16 19:27:50 Can't see one that doesn't have palm oil in  Cadbury's, Mars, Nestlé should try harder. Tobelerone's ok though.
1902 2018-08-16 19:27:32 I think so. Is it gonna happen? Facebook is pretty quiet.
1903 2018-08-16 19:27:18 Haba ..muse Kenan ai

1907 2018-08-16 19:26:55 CBDcannabis oil for cancers
1908 2018-08-16 19:26:52 Yeah you can get the tea tree oil from Walmart the guy who does my piercings tells me to use it. I got one when i first got my nose pierced and it worked.
1909 2018-08-16 19:26:43 CBD oil has made a huge difference for my anxiety
1910 2018-08-16 19:26:38 No a cleanser is intended to remove dirt and oil whereas an exfoliator is to remove dead skin cells. Cleanser you can use daily. I would start with exfoliating 1/2 a week until you learn your skin.
1911 2018-08-16 19:26:34 vegetable oil under the sink too!! i know it’s weird bc we’ve got cleaning supplies under there too but idk man that’s just where it goes
1912 2018-08-16 19:26:34 Oil changes are getting pricey
1913 2018-08-16 19:26:33 It really doesn’t matter what oil is priced in. It could be priced in dollars or bananas. What matters is whether people want to hold on to any dollars they have. Trump wants to make it more difficult to export to America and so fewer people will have dollars. In the future I...
1914 2018-08-16 19:26:25 oil facts
1915 2018-08-16 19:26:23 Palm oil & egg
1916 2018-08-16 19:26:22 Yes, apply a little of oil your choice or butter in the container where you will be cooking your eggs.
1917 2018-08-16 19:26:18    . The other day it was pizzazone and shawarmazone. Today it's trade zone. Dude saw from the first purchase that she didn't want to date, he should not have tried to get her attention with more purchase. Sister, you sef deliver the perfume oil or at least 60% balance
1918 2018-08-16 19:26:14 Same af! Oh,it’s 200 for the best oil change you have to offer? Do it!!!
1919 2018-08-16 19:26:12 I am instantly suspicious and doubtful of anyone be who claims to be passionate about something inanimate- like olive oil, or local produce, or a sport.
1920 2018-08-16 19:26:03 Add some sriracha and a bit of hot chili sesame oil to your spicy chicken ramen. Then serve it over some cauliflower rice. It was amazing
1921 2018-08-16 19:25:59 it is freeing us up from the Middle East.. thank Goodness we have a President that is trying to get us out of those wars, and not one that wants us enslaved to Middle Eastern Oil
1922 2018-08-16 19:25:59 damn the mayo slander is so real somebody tried to tell me aioli isnt flavored mayo they said its egg yolks oil and citrus BITCH WHATD U THINK MAYO IS
1923 2018-08-16 19:25:51 You should read more, "Prof." The root of Venezuela's problems lie in sanctions, manipulation & corruption from the United States since the 1950s.  We put dictators in power and then began punishing them when the oil was nationalized, and we've never stopped.
1924 2018-08-16 19:25:41 You support; job killing tariffs, oil drilling off of our beautiful coast, inaction in addressing ongoing gun violence, and provide zero ideas on improving traffic/commuting concerns. Do you have any GOOD ideas?
1925 2018-08-16 19:25:39 Question for all black people what does the Korean/Asians know about black hair? They bring all these products from China and it’s been reported many black woman have caught cancer from them. Coconut/ olive oil works well for my hair we’re making the asians and Indians wealthy.

1929 2018-08-16 19:25:00 Absolutely. The politically illiterate make perfect patsies for the snake oil salesmen promising political revolution & philosophical salvation for the low cost of $27.
1930 2018-08-16 19:24:48 The girls and I are about to head out to @FIRE_rope . Luckily one of us has jojoba oil, but all of us have lots of rope... and bottle caps... and other things that make bottoms go... ouch! Just remember “ow, you mother fucker!!” Is not a safe word 
1931 2018-08-16 19:24:38 I make my own from oils found in plants, fruit and nuts. In other words, I can eat the whole food product itself. Except for those not for consumption like sweet almond oil.
1932 2018-08-16 19:24:30 My dad just taught me how to change my oil.

1937 2018-08-16 19:24:11 If oil is made outta dinosaurs, and plastic is made outta oil, don't we just eat seaweed??
1938 2018-08-16 19:24:08 When ndakaini dam was almost dry,the electricity was cheaper and then the rains came and we were told to expect even cheaperpower..The cost doubled.Sometimes back, petroleum products were affordable and then Tullow oil happened..Now petrol is on it's way up to 130ksh per litre 
1939 2018-08-16 19:24:03 Make sure you change the oil in your car. "Better Call Saul" is a great TV show. I never get tired of good cheesburgers. Summer passes way too quickly.
1940 2018-08-16 19:23:58 Garlic
Lime 
Salt 
Cayenne 
Olive Oil
Saffron or Fresh Turmeric

Warm the oil for a couple seconds so the saffron dissolves then you can put everything in a food processor. Drink it like a shot. Really helps your immune system
1941 2018-08-16 19:23:53 A "small" group striving to go back to the roots, after a relatively short period of progress. It ended up becoming a kind of reformation of sunni Islam, in the wrong direction, its now essentially the state religion of saudi arabia and being spread world wide w oil money.
1942 2018-08-16 19:23:51 tea tree oil is the best spot treatment!
1943 2018-08-16 19:23:48 I'm going to be at this workshop on Monday, afternoon, talking about California oil production.  Please come, or watch online!  The agenda will be posted soon...I have a feeling it is going to be lively  Ahttps://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/CARB/bulletins/205091e

1945 2018-08-16 19:23:34 I never said it was a women only it’s nothing wrong with keeping yo nails clean but there are things that are feminine and masculine if a girl was to say you stay in the car while she jack it up change the tire and change the oil you would feel and think
1946 2018-08-16 19:23:11 .I don't trust any of these snake oil selling carnival barkers. Laying their hands on Donald Trump who suddenly became Christian because he was appealing to his trashy hypocritical base.
1947 2018-08-16 19:23:07 I like ricotta and it made me open up to white sauce but I am not a fan per se. Ill try just oil oil on something. Maybe the chicken one
1948 2018-08-16 19:23:03 It’s like Aloe baby oil Johnson and Johnson. I also ordered this lavender stick from In the Weeds care products from SA it works well too it’s all natural.

1960 2018-08-16 19:21:47 I love spending money on my car. Like car washes, oil changes and all that stuff. Idk maybe it’s the butch queen in me but it makes me feel like I have it together.

1964 2018-08-16 19:21:29 We might both agree the snake oil should be removed, but it’s so a part of the brand value that it might be better to temper it (no more grandiose promises) than to repudiate Musk entirely. Unless some other dreamer could be groomed to take over.
1965 2018-08-16 19:21:26 Not really sure why I made an appointment to get an oil change at 3 only to be sent to the express service where I'm waiting in the blazing sun for what will be at least an hour. This is why, among other reasons, I do my own maintenance.
1966 2018-08-16 19:21:23 Blood of the lamb dem use as oil
1967 2018-08-16 19:21:20 What is something you always store in the same place b/c that's where your mom always put it growing up? Mine include the bottle of vegetable oil under the sink and cookie sheets in the warming drawer.
1968 2018-08-16 19:21:14 But the NATO, UAE, oil conglomerate, Wall Street, and defense contractor-supported neoliberal think tank promised us they were only going to disappear the bad people!
1969 2018-08-16 19:21:01 I don’t mind changing sauces. Not a fan of white sauce. Lately been doing olive oil.
1970 2018-08-16 19:20:43 i recommend you use the Too Faced Peach Perfect powder on ur T-zone for oil control it rlly works wonders 
1971 2018-08-16 19:20:32 Ahh, yes. I agree.

Have you tried the CBD oil with thc? I think you'll find a miracle cure with this I've heard. I know someone who's been taking it with her reg cancer treatment. It's been 6 months and it has disappeared.
1994 2018-08-16 19:18:11 The oil companies are firmly in control of Trump, the Republican Party and the country. Whatever happened in the past is irrelevant to this issue.  Anyone can easily find out who bows to corporate masters

1997 2018-08-16 19:18:00 I agree with him on most things. I guess my biggest disagreement is the oil dependency isn't really changing but I know that not depending on overseas oil is a big step in the right direction. My biggest reason to not vote for him is I didn't trust he would do what he said.
1998 2018-08-16 19:17:56 If you've ever wondered how Neocon "think-tankers" spend their mornings, they're usually being interviewed by the Oil & Gas media as "experts on Arab politics", but none of them speak Arabic. Can you imagine @CNN inviting an "Arab expert on US politics" who can't speak English?
1999 2018-08-16 19:17:55 just one more thing not nailed down as tight as Dems would want it and we have no idea what repubs would want nailed down.  From the Rs behavior over the trump crime family, they want no laws impeding their snake oil salesman's time ruining the presidency.

2015 2018-08-16 19:15:52 Dough is easy-flower, yeast, water-just be sure to let it rise in the fridge overnight. Sauce is personal preference.

2018 2018-08-16 19:15:46 The dollar is popular because Oil is paid and traded in USD. Thats why we have a term “petro-dollars” . You cant buy Oil in EUR any other currency. Once petro-dollar is collapsed, then bye-bye USD.

2053 2018-08-16 19:11:46 @realDonaldTrump Oil sanctions are very important for us, and all countries must completely cut off their oil by November 4th. The Iranian regime should not be able to export a barrel of oil on November 4, never.

2079 2018-08-16 19:09:19 @realDonaldTrump I think Brian Hooke is a good option for the presidency to act against Iran, but I just have to say that it is very important that he used the word "case" in the oil sanctions, which we do not understand.
2080 2018-08-16 19:08:50 torture is waiting for what seems forever for an oil change in a mechanic’s waiting room, getting up to pour some coffee but stopping midway b/c it’s cold, and being forced to watch the pre-set cooking channel of middle aged midwestern men smoking 69392 types of meat

2089 2018-08-16 19:07:55 put some olive oil in my hair before shampooing and it’s soft as Fuck rn, tho i smell like a salad
2090 2018-08-16 19:07:13 One of my favorite #petty pastimes is to go to my old dealership to get my oil changed and look at their sales numbers and be like “Those were never that bad when I was here. What’s going on?”
2091 2018-08-16 19:07:10 During Atal ji's time, India saw an Earthquake, 2 Cyclones, worst Drought in 30 years, Oil crisis, Kargil, USA sanctions, Yet GDP didn't falter in his time. Today we lost one of the best PMs of India, Bhishma Pitamah of Politics.

2092 2018-08-16 19:06:54 My great grandma just anointed my sister and I with oil. Just wanted y’all to know that the pentecost experienced back then is the exact same that we experience today.
2093 2018-08-16 19:06:43 Welcome to the club. Coconut oil blended in coffee is always a wonder.
2094 2018-08-16 19:06:40 Got my trucks oil changed, ordered a new steering wheel, and washed with a full tank of gas. It’s a good day
2095 2018-08-16 19:06:33 thinking abt that one time when bella thorne said that she never uses toothpaste and instead uses coconut oil :/

2107 2018-08-16 19:05:30 My ranger (2013) was bought a year old in early '14, cost a €1500 in '15- '16, was driven low in oil in 2017 and had to be rebored, €1500, but is as good as new in 18, never better. 
Thinking will I keep it, having spent or trade it while it's good

2108 2018-08-16 19:05:27 Trump is a snake oil salesman, but he has been played from the beginning by Deep state shills/moles in the CIA, FBI and NSA. and yes he does not understand the world of espionage, or the history of all the people involved.

2110 2018-08-16 19:05:09 getting oil changes are fun because every time my car needs like $2,000 worth of work done on it.
2111 2018-08-16 19:05:08 understanding what refiners are doing is something the data is not showing apart from the basics like throughput etc. unless this aspect of there oil market is considered mistakes will be made.
2112 2018-08-16 19:05:06 UGH that sounds amazing we’ve just been doing salt and pepper and oil. obviously need to get more creative lmao

2125 2018-08-16 19:04:03 Plastic straws. Biology. Police. This could go on all day.
2126 2018-08-16 19:03:38 But you praise a carnival barker who is selling snake oil every day...
2127 2018-08-16 19:03:33 Resources such as oil/minerals and metals/political power/land mass/occupation of geographically strategic land/sea mass... list is endless and art being a bonus I imagine. I'm AGREEING with you! 
2128 2018-08-16 19:03:28 Idk if buying premade chicken strips will be much different. Yesterday it was literally fried in oil like strips are.
2129 2018-08-16 19:03:18 Shit. I think I'm going to throw up too as a form of empathetic gesture (biologically explained, of course).

He didn't show any interest of inhaling my aromatherapic oil, so I used it to mine, preventing the desire to throw up just like him. >

2131 2018-08-16 19:03:06 Will someone please oil that door squeaking in the background?
2132 2018-08-16 19:03:00 I'd add crispy brown sugar coated , mild Chorizo sausage, and ghost peppers that were dipped in Liquid Nitrogen. Annnnd replace that sauce with some Garlic Ranch infused with sage and star anise, brush some olive oil on that crust, and fill it with Parma Reggiano!! BOOM!!
2133 2018-08-16 19:02:58 Yes! U truly saved my life with that tip thank u sm (Jenna if ur into oil cleansing try cleansing with part castor oil, part another oil like grape seed oil and u can add a few drops of tea tree oil to help kill bacteria)
2134 2018-08-16 19:02:57 Have to get a oil change.. before my shit stop driving 
2135 2018-08-16 19:02:43 I spent the afternoon editing a book about olive oil. Now I'm hungry for it.
2136 2018-08-16 19:02:37 If you re-read my tweet that is not what I said. What I did say is that we have citizens living here who work in the oil patch as well as the Trans-Mountain pipeline route passes directly through my riding.
2137 2018-08-16 19:02:33 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.
2138 2018-08-16 19:02:28 Everytime i go to any Chevy Dealership to get my car serviced they always try to sell me their $600 maintenance packages. im like nahh Just the Oil Change is fine 
2139 2018-08-16 19:02:16 Yeees , but we don’t have Oil , to get that stuff we have to sell our live cattle to Saoudi Arabia , the poor animal has a bumpy ride all the way to Ryad , and when it gets there they cut its head (halal , try it Al, go to Roselands S centre and eat tasty meat for a change )
2140 2018-08-16 19:02:15 Oh light has gone and oil isn't in generator so hot weather can't sleep in this time
2141 2018-08-16 19:02:09 Use a little bit of olive oil it will bring out the colours better and its easier to re do if it ever get a mark on it x x
2142 2018-08-16 19:02:01 @SBakerMD So should I be using MCT Oil in my morning coffee?
2143 2018-08-16 19:01:39 ooo! thanks! i might try that tbh cause i don't think my skin likes tea tree oil very much
2144 2018-08-16 19:01:39 I hope to be living there in the next few months! My favorite area in all of USA!!
2145 2018-08-16 19:01:32 Your thesis is that there is no more room for US light oil- in US or in the world.  But I see lot of companies such as PAA, EPD, EPIC etc. gearing up for export. XOM is gearing up for consumption in US. If what you say is true, Permian production has peaked.
2146 2018-08-16 19:01:27 The air quality wouldn't be as much of a problem, except we installed new A/C this week, and we aren't changing the filter until we get past the new A/C smell. (They store some of the components in oil to prevent rust or something, so it stinks for a few days after installation.)

2154 2018-08-16 19:00:33 The other problem with it is that US State Dept archives from the 1970s reveal European leaders proposing "Freegold" to settle imbalances with Arab oil exporters.  One of the European leaders mentioned was Wim Duisenberg.  He later appears again as ECB president at launch of EUR.

2164 2018-08-16 18:59:58 Ah, but I wonder how many "middle of no wheres" to you are the equivalent to Timp to someone else. Interesting to ponder what we do/don't consider 'the middle of no where'! (I'm not 100% against responsible oil development fwiw.)

2168 2018-08-16 18:59:24 Common Core wasn't enough to dumb down Americans: constant oil wars to inflict TBI on our soldiers & trauma for US Citizens to cause brain damage. Anything to destroy our minds. I'm surprised there isn't a gov't commission on what else can be done to destroy people's brains more.
2169 2018-08-16 18:59:24 Norwegians may have beat us at football and using oil wealth for social good but we still formed our nation successfully fending off their raids.

This stuff’s as serious as RU & mob, & it’s been going on a LONG time under radar—the christofascist & oil/gas cabals. All overlapping desired authoritarian ends.
2175 2018-08-16 18:58:30 Anybody got any vegetable oil or butter  in shane 
2176 2018-08-16 18:58:28 Haha global warming... so what should we do about the volcanoes that spew carbon monoxide into the air or the thousands of gallons of oil pour out of the ocean floor? The earth doesn't care and will be fine. Humankind cares about global warming period.
2177 2018-08-16 18:58:18 Our environmental standards are higher than what the @epa requires, let alone those in the nations I have listed in the previous tweet. Our oil is selling at a massive discount because the foreign funded voices of NO are obstructing our access to markets other than the USA.
2178 2018-08-16 18:58:15 It's like a turnip or really big brussel sprout.  You peel away the outer layers of it and cut it and boil it or steam it. It can also be baked with olive oil and garlic and onion or served with butter sauce or white cream sauce. I first had it in Germany

Anointing with oil is not mystical. The contact of the hands with oil will transmit God's healing power to undo that which Satan has wrought and to effect a healing and a cure

2214 2018-08-16 18:51:59 Who has Obama bumper stickers? For real. I have not seen one in probably 6 or 7 years. But trump keeps filling this "swamp" every day. That's like saying "you'll see. In 2 months trump will have this swamp cleared of a toxic oil spill" WHILE you watch him dumping oil into it
2215 2018-08-16 18:51:53 Truth to be told, I think GG mostly just has fizzled out. Safe for the occasional drop of oil on the fire when we're the boogey man [insert literally anything here] again.
2216 2018-08-16 18:51:50 California Republicans are psycho they’re straight up running ads dragging Democrats for supporting “radical environmental regulations” because it would raise the price of gas and oil even though their entire state is literally on fire

2219 2018-08-16 18:51:31 Tarrifs are a tax doesnt matter if there simple taxs are the same . We have alot of taxs some simple some not so much. Tarrifs are to restrict commerce from flooding our streets right ? I work in offshore oil taxing all over the world and see tarrifs on everything we do.

エキストラバージンオリーブオイルとはオリーブの果実を搾ってろ過しただけのバージンオイルです。
2222 2018-08-16 18:51:17 Wood burners burn wood not coal, that's called a multi fuel stove or open fire! Wet wood won't burn properly anyway. What do those who don't have access to gas and can't afford electric heating do? Yes oil also expensive and polluting.

2226 2018-08-16 18:51:07 The right lane of NB I-75 at MM14 is closed due to a semi accident--the truck is off of the highway.  No injuries reported.  Monroe Police and Monroe Fire are on the scene. The truck appears to be leaking oil.

Ne careful out there!

2231 2018-08-16 18:50:27 No oil or gas up there...but I’d oppose that!  That’s not in the middle of nowhere that’s Timp!
2232 2018-08-16 18:50:12 Fine geh no pimples only oil perfumes!!
2233 2018-08-16 18:50:02 But, not being made of petroleum byproducts, they'll be banned by some slithering bribed-by-Big-Oil U.S. politician -- as were biodegradable chip bags — for being *too noisy*! And they get away with it! 
2234 2018-08-16 18:49:44 Director of Policy Planning/US Special Representative for Iran, Brian Hook, says US prepared to impose secondary sanctions on other governments that continue to import oil from Iran. Will work case by case basis with nations working to reduce imports.

2236 2018-08-16 18:49:36 What I love about my nails is that they recover so quick & with the oil I’ve been putting on them it’s even quicker than the usual 
2237 2018-08-16 18:49:26 Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, really became know for the suggestion of lemon, garlic and olive oil to treat Aids. I'm not laughing 
2238 2018-08-16 18:49:20 I think I speak for us American's with some common sense that we support you 100% . We pray for your safety & Thank you for keeping us safe. To all those that oppose you, I invite them to fill your shoes for a day!!! #IStandWithICE #GodBlessOurICEOfficers
2239 2018-08-16 18:49:15 I met someone from Nova Scotia a few days ago and she was telling me her brother made a ton working up in northern Alberta. Mostly oil field stuff. Inland in most areas Can or US always seemed cheaper. That's why I was even looking at Minnesota. Cheap as shit in Minneapolis.

2241 2018-08-16 18:49:12 Hey @AldiUK. Love you and all but I also love orangutans so won't knowingly buy anything that contains palm oil. Picked up your lovely American-style cheesecake, as per usual, but put it back after checking the ingredients this time. Please change them. Thanks. #DropDirtyPalmOil
2242 2018-08-16 18:49:02 I haven’t used all of my new products yet because I don’t wanna break my face out trying too many new products at once!

2244 2018-08-16 18:48:46 If inflation continues, oil sales dramatically reduced post November and difficulty repatriating oil revenue, Iran will be back at the table.
2245 2018-08-16 18:48:38 you have 30 million citizens. We have the most wealth by far and we actually use innovation to create wealth. Whats hard about digging an oil well? You let England take all your oil for the first 75 years of oil production. Start to love science and you will be create success
2246 2018-08-16 18:48:38 It is satisfying to change your own oil, but in your case there is to much risk of damaging your hands!
2247 2018-08-16 18:48:36 Islam and feminism is like oil and water: they cannot mix.
2248 2018-08-16 18:48:36 I feel sick, like how? We have our own oil, we should expect the prices to be low, we r being taken for a ride. This extra levies goes into pockets of few through public looting n corruption, tenderprenours n PR projects. Only wanjiku will suffer.

2252 2018-08-16 18:47:55 .@AmericanHiking US government should BUY more land to protect areas eg  The Wave (Google it).  Trump/Zinke unprotecting areas so vast it exceeds the amount of land Teddy Roosevelt had protected. They do business in the name of oil, natural gas, coal & uranium, not environment.
2253 2018-08-16 18:47:54 Jody D. You have no idea and or clue about economics with such an absurd reply! The very reason AB + Canada is the best place to live is due to its social programs! Free market is what caused our severe recession! Boy those oil workers sure loved the E.I. program 2015!
2254 2018-08-16 18:47:42 Oh Joe...I do feel sorry for you. Going through life believing every snake oil salesman you meet. Never doing any checking of your own to see whether the claims have any validity. That’s no way to live...poor bloke.
2255 2018-08-16 18:47:36 I have strong, strong doubts Alberta and Saskatchewan would support the Libs or the NDP.  Out we are as sick or sicker of Trudeau than anybody. Remember where the oil is.
2256 2018-08-16 18:47:22 my oil short rolled off today... was good while it lasted
2257 2018-08-16 18:46:59 Bare minimum if you have your L 
You should be able to 
-change a tire 
-jump a car 
-check your oil (at the least) 
Should know how to change your own oil but its ok if you dont.
-check all other fluids...
2258 2018-08-16 18:46:40 In my opinion, taking money from Big Oil and Gas, Wall Street, Big Pharma and the @nra would qualify as a "fringe agenda." No Democrat should he getting in bed with these evil institutions. Are you listening, @JoeManchinWV ?? No shooting the ACA bill this time, ok buddy?
2259 2018-08-16 18:46:35 my mother gave me a fish oil supplement and I broke it in half and swallowed the oil from it. don't ever do that if you like yourself.
2260 2018-08-16 18:46:25 2. PMB didn't decrease our GDP, if you paid attention to economics in school you'll know that the factors affecting the economy including the oil prices also affects the GDP
2261 2018-08-16 18:46:20 And the oil revenue is better shared. They have both a higher GDP/capita, and a *much* lower Gini coefficient. (That is, lower inequality.)

2264 2018-08-16 18:45:39 Bookmarking, bookmarking, bookmarking! Although... not entirely convinced about the pumpkin oil thing. Didn't we drink pumpkin wine together once in Latvia and, well, it WAS different... #TasteofAustria
2265 2018-08-16 18:45:33 not true Geraldo, much research has proven their oil wells are drying up. They are purchasing arms for their own defense of the future. What happens when the wells are dry. new take over? by whom?
2266 2018-08-16 18:45:26 I mean, if you're going to write science, law, and literature, then do so. But when you conflate them into pseudoscience, philosophy, and theology, you're just selling snake oil in the language of deceit.
2267 2018-08-16 18:45:25 Your question makes absolutely no sense.
1. The falling oil prices affected oil dependent economies around the world including Saudi Arabia, Russia and Venezuela. However, Saudi and Russia were able to cover up effectively while Venezuela and Nigeria failed
2268 2018-08-16 18:45:19 I love how tea tree oil smells
2269 2018-08-16 18:45:12 lmbooo. You have to get a tablespoon of coconut oil and it might not sound like alot but oh boy! You'll be saying, "I give up!" lol
2270 2018-08-16 18:45:08 Its easy to curse and moan when gas seems expensive The oil companies are abusing the helpless customers who are effectively indentured to them and can name their own prices thanks to a system of collusion and profiteering Something, probably involving legislation ought to be
2271 2018-08-16 18:44:38 .@MsRebeccaBaker, Thank you for explaining.  Perhaps it's time for a new funny, coz "the Prez" has undermined your sense for humor?

2273 2018-08-16 18:44:31 U.S. demand sustained highest level in 11 years at 20.6m b/d in July
Nearly all demand growth between June and July stemmed from residual fuel oil, and to lesser extent, kerosene jet fuel
according to an American Petroleum Institute monthly statistical report.

2282 2018-08-16 18:44:04 okay okay I hear you but once I got a legendary ice bow with x3 buff for fire damage, a legendary fire grenade, and that sword that spreads oil everywhere. I beat a major beef wall boss for the first time. I'm still mourning that load out.
2283 2018-08-16 18:43:37 Pompeo/Hook say this Iran Action Group is to track "daily progress" in working to change Iran's behavior and will coordinate actions in State and across the interagency. Also we're still working with allies whom we are asking to get crude oil imports to zero by Nov. 4.

2290 2018-08-16 18:42:50 Lavender oil. Not loads, clears the tubes and acts as a soporific

2298 2018-08-16 18:42:04 What no... I was surprised you've never had sesame oil of any sort.  For specifically white sesame oil I'm not sure I've ever had it myself (maybe at a restaurant at some point where I don't know the ingredients but never knowingly)

2311 2018-08-16 18:40:58 @UKenyatta I would really like to know your honest opinion not your political opinion. Does this issue of exempting oil and its products from VAT worrying you as a president knowing all money channels of the country? Is it a matter that should worry the people of Kenya?

2322 2018-08-16 18:40:38 Short characters to say - politics not cause “anymore” (I’m still angry at Perez/party heavyweights).  But having testified in 2009 on Waxman-Markey in front of a dis-interested Joe Barton, it hit me how carefully Big Oil R’s are “placed” in Congress.  Not Dem’s fault, for sure.

2324 2018-08-16 18:40:23 Why taint delicious things like bread, butter, tomato, bacon, chicken, cheese, w/e else with egg yolk and fat? Its gross. But it depends on the sandwich, could be oil, pesto, tapenade, anything really. Mayo just drowns out other flavors too much.
2325 2018-08-16 18:40:22 Unconventional oil drilling is happening in Surrey. It's not shale gas fracking, but very similar. And the outcome is no different: local communities are having their objections ignored by central government.
2326 2018-08-16 18:40:17 The grid CAN be, but it isn't. That's going to take time. So, like I said, if you want a Nordic model now, you're going to have to go through a bunch of demographic and cultural changes. Also, we're going to need a LOT more oil, someone else will have to be lone superpower.

The oil well never  realized enormous profits, but it triggered Lima's oil industry, bringing John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil to Lima.

2356 2018-08-16 18:36:49 Well your boy Trudeau is....... still supplying planes,armoured vehicles and is buying their oil. Carbon tax exempt. #Hypocrite

2361 2018-08-16 18:36:18 Baby oil σε εκθέματα #βυζαντινού μουσείου ρίξαν οι άλλες. Έτσι απλά χωρίς κανένα κέρδος. Κορίτσια, το baby oil χρησιμοποιηστε το στο σεξ, να φανεί και χρήσιμο...
2362 2018-08-16 18:36:12 i think i just fell in love with an oil colour
2363 2018-08-16 18:36:12 I will die before I forgive anyone who spread that lie.
2364 2018-08-16 18:36:08 Use cooking oil or some kind of lube to grease up your egg dish and it will fall out and not start looking like pottery from the Ming Dynasty 
2365 2018-08-16 18:35:56 My favourite was when the SGI Minister shut down the cleaner vehicle incentive then went to work as a Big Oil lobbyist.

2367 2018-08-16 18:35:54 @zachmadkins by any chance, do you have an oil diffuser? it’s for science
2368 2018-08-16 18:35:53 Lastly, tar sands are among the most dirty, highly polluting source of oil in the world. How you extract your oil plays a role.

2372 2018-08-16 18:35:29 Barley or rye flour, White flour, Sunflower Oil, Dried Yeast, Anise Seeds, Fennel Seeds, water & Salt - tastes nothing like chapati, tortillas, or pita. Great with graved lox and cucumber!
2373 2018-08-16 18:35:20 Nah. Its cauliflower not rice. However you can season the shit out of it, think fried roce with ginger, garlic, sesame oil, lime juice
2374 2018-08-16 18:35:13 I'm not sure which streaming radio channel is on at the shop today but so far I've heard Salt n Pepa, Echo and the Bunnymen, Midnight Oil, Young MC, De La Soul, and Mike Scott and the Waterboys.
2375 2018-08-16 18:35:12 jojoba oil enak!!! aku pakenya dicampur 2 tetes sama milk cleanser. trus pas habis cuci muka 1 tetes di area idung, ntar kaya keluar gitu komedonya. kl grapeseed aku baru coba 3 harian jd belom keliatan sih efeknya

Why? We must resist, we cannot allow debate to be shutdown by these apartheid apologists!
2384 2018-08-16 18:34:11 Big Brands need to STOP producing dirty palm oil #STOP #SaveRangTan
2385 2018-08-16 18:34:10 Palm oil trees are replanted after harvest period is over? Only takes 10 years before harvest ready.
2386 2018-08-16 18:34:08 I think if you live in BC and are opposed to exploitation of natural resources, you are living In the wrong place. Like a Saudi citizen who is opposed to drilling for oil. 

Every BC road, school, and hospital is paid for through natural resources. 

Protesters should learn this.
2387 2018-08-16 18:34:06 One of our pipes started leaking this week and after 2 days of failed attempts to seal the leak I was ready to give up on life. I can't even imagine how frustrated those people were during the 2010 BP oil spill that took 5 months to fix.
2388 2018-08-16 18:34:03 Always until I R.I.P.  Coconut oil or Vaseline are clutch for  fuckin’

2390 2018-08-16 18:33:56 Don’t miss the bäckhendl (fried chicken) at Der Steirer and Austrian-style pintxos at Francowitsch. And grab a bottle of that fabulous pumpkin seed oil (awesome on salads, omelettes and vanilla ice-cream!). 
2391 2018-08-16 18:33:54 Islanders don't have stick man figures but coconut oil keeps them healthy, they are proof of this. It's due to the coconut's MCFAs. Spaghetti noodles boiled w coconut oil (cooks at high temperature-another benefit) are delicious! Dried unsweetened flakes have 4g of fiber, also.
2392 2018-08-16 18:33:50 I spilled tea tree oil in my car so when I’m driving I feel like I’m suffocating but when I get out my nose feels so fresh lol
2393 2018-08-16 18:33:48 breaking of the fast that day in Morning Star Christian Fellowship. Uninvited except by Igor,  I arrived from Holy Land Jerusalem area with loves of barley bread, flat breads, olive breads, spreads, bread oil to use like butter.
2394 2018-08-16 18:33:40 Lavender essential oil. Doterra is my go to brand. Doterra has a blend also called Balance which also helps
2395 2018-08-16 18:33:35 This castor oil has my hair shininggg
2396 2018-08-16 18:33:34 A little Olive oil coating the plate.
2397 2018-08-16 18:33:31 Huh, given your tastes and the teasing you've done, Foxe, I figured you'd be proud of Oil for pulling this off!
2398 2018-08-16 18:33:30 WTI oil $65.10/barrel.
2399 2018-08-16 18:33:27 thank you so much!  ahh yeah, i have a hard time getting gouache to a thick consistency so i sometimes use oil on top for more even coverage. theyre water soluble oils so they interact just fine with gouache!

2403 2018-08-16 18:33:14 You may not appreciate the content (most of us don't), but at least the masonry is impressive.  If I'm not mistaken, the dome was under construction during the Civil War and was of symbolic importance for Lincoln.

2405 2018-08-16 18:33:10 What action should Trudeau have done instead of crying at his father's funeral?

Maybe you should stick to shilling for oil companies...
2406 2018-08-16 18:33:07 From @AP Authorities say bodies believed to be a pregnant woman and her two young children were found on the property of one of Colorado's largest oil and gas drillers where her husband used to work.
2407 2018-08-16 18:33:00 He didn’t sacrifice for USA. He was murdered for the sake of Israel and oil and mining companies and commercial weapons manufacturers. Iraq war was orchestrated by pro Israeli Zionist neocon and fought by foolish Americans. It has nothing to do with USA freedom
2408 2018-08-16 18:32:57 @gmbutts they can start a alternative economy no coal no oil and initiate sharia law full burquas everywhere allowed and preferred drugs honor killings raping children they'd love it and same as toronto is now and ottawa next except Westboro where u live capers would love it lol
2409 2018-08-16 18:32:51 Use cashier oil errrday and only comb wet or damp hair
2410 2018-08-16 18:32:30 ...Russia gains direct access to Mediteranean. Is this alternative plan to marching into #Montenegro or just another facet?
Nixing world dependence on oil would most definitely throw a monkey wrench into at least a significant profit drive for all involved (including ...3/
2411 2018-08-16 18:32:12 That‘s just because of Albania being a black hole for Petrol stations and car washes. They suck them out of each neighbouring country any none ever escape again! But all they sell after beeing sucked there is petrol and motor oil. Wait and see. 
2412 2018-08-16 18:32:10 Careful by the windows there! At night with lights on in the room you can see right in from the street. Quite a few interesting things seen there so far........ during oil and gas week few months ago, it was quite the show in some of the room windows
2413 2018-08-16 18:32:04 I would say that these unpaid protesters are far more concerned with long term solutions than short terms profits. The only paid protesters here are the oil lobbyists here in the digital realm. 

Oil sands are obsolete. Either accept it, or learn the heard way in a few years.
2414 2018-08-16 18:31:56 The Big Bang Theory is on while I'm waiting to get my oil changed and I imagine this is roughly what hell is like
2415 2018-08-16 18:31:51 there is an alternative with in oil and gas production and refining market, but its not time. Yet. haha
2416 2018-08-16 18:31:29 Getting my oil changed for my car and decided to read while I waited. Best oil change I’ve been to in years! #writerslife #amreading #booklover #bookworm #lostinthepages

2419 2018-08-16 18:31:20 They know oil is dying and are hitching their wagon to the fresh horse
2420 2018-08-16 18:31:19 Baby oil is essentially just mineral oil and is more likely to clog your pores than help! Argan/Marula/Rosehip would work better. And usually you’d still want to top it or mix it with your night moisturizer
2421 2018-08-16 18:31:00 Yeah, it kinda is lol. You have to swish the oil around your mouth for 20 minutes, I believe. Hopefully, it works for you. Charcoal does seem to seem your mouth cleaner when you rinse it away.
2422 2018-08-16 18:30:58 Snake oil is popular these days for some reason.
2423 2018-08-16 18:30:53 I can’t talk about this particular thing, but the best thing for soothing scars is basically any type of oil 3 times a day. I use coconut or olive!
2424 2018-08-16 18:30:51 U didn't add fresh water fish. The okro shouldn't be over cooked+native oil. Fresh water fish o, "Inangha" in my dialect
2425 2018-08-16 18:30:50 it's when you mix two liquids that aren't soluble, eg oil and vinegar
2426 2018-08-16 18:30:46 Went out to get fried chicken and ranch. Came back with spring green mix, oil and vinegar.
2427 2018-08-16 18:30:28 She browns outside of the oxtails before cooking. She uses flour and seasonings then use oil to brown it up to give it great flavor. She will put pinto beans that had been soaked overnight in the crockpot and then put the browned oxtail on top and cook till meat falls off bone

2431 2018-08-16 18:29:58 Why do we need it??? To send oil to China?? It's not for our consumption, it's to sell. And, where is the guarantee that China will still buy when they can now purchase 4x the volume, and a "cleaner" bitumen at that, through the new LOOP port in the US? 1/2
2432 2018-08-16 18:29:50 gal always wah drive inna you cah and nah gi you gas or oil money but as soon as you drive dem things a bare noise dem mek suck unu mumma yah man
2433 2018-08-16 18:29:40 I love good hydrating oil! Like Argan or Rosehip. (You can get high end or not) and either mix it with or apply it under or over a moisturizer! And she might need some exfoliation. A treatment with glycolic or lactic acid at least a few times a week will help
2434 2018-08-16 18:29:30 Wait it is written there that no fuel no changing of oil so what does it use
2435 2018-08-16 18:29:30 Woman in bathing suit eating ribs, oil on canvas. #lakesuperior
2436 2018-08-16 18:29:27 Hi Simon, I spoke with a friend who thinks there should be a permanent oil supply to the 'knuckle', I am trying to track down 'Archie' his Father in Law who may be able to add more.
2437 2018-08-16 18:29:25 I... I don't think oil paint is edible...

2444 2018-08-16 18:28:00 Went in for an oil change and found out there’s literally TWO pages of shit wrong with my car totalling just under 5k. Good thing I’m moving to Berlin so I dont have to worry about it
2445 2018-08-16 18:27:55 Scotland has two new oil platforms with 50yrs worth of oil someone needs to do their homework !!
2446 2018-08-16 18:27:53 Well, he’d have a team to make sure there was oil in his gearbox and stuff like that.

2449 2018-08-16 18:27:19 Never thought I’d give into the essential oils hype. But I got a diffuser and put lavender oil in it last night and omg our room smelled absolutely amazing. And awhile back Bryan’s mom got me this one for my headaches and it has helped me so much.
2450 2018-08-16 18:27:13 Republican Weasel Greg Walden is running pathetically misleading ads about how he helps manage forests in Oregon to pretend he's trying to help the fires. 

What he won't do is admit that #ClimateChange is the cause. He supports big oil co's & Russia.
2451 2018-08-16 18:27:00 Turkey falling into Russian's grip is a next step in Putin's dream of "Eurasia" (cite - Timothy Snyder, "Road To Unfreedom"), as a fascist counterweight & ultimate crushing of EU. Oil reserves a key to this entire Russia-Trump-EU nightmare. I'm thinking also by annexing Turkey 2/

And only 1 of them has the oil bonus, the others are still ranked top in the world."
2471 2018-08-16 18:25:19 Let’s also not forget. We don’t just ‘turn the boat around’ we do if it’s safe to. If there is any doubt we put them on an $400,000 unsinkable fiberglass boat designed for oil rig rescues. So this ongoing narrative that we don’t give a shit about their lives is just bullshit
2472 2018-08-16 18:25:18 Need to start applying my Jamaican black castor oil again. This beard will not grow itself. 
2473 2018-08-16 18:25:16 KJVA Bible. Genesis 28:18
[18]And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.
2474 2018-08-16 18:25:11 Guy all you need is the grace to "mind your own business". A real man doesn't comment on every matter on social media. Nevertheless, you as an Engr ought to have appreciated the innovative , creative work and spirit of whoever that built the machine, b4any form of critism.
2475 2018-08-16 18:24:20 You mean when we sent black men to fight, and still discriminated against them after the war? When we put the Japanese in internment camps? When we went to space to COMPETE with Russia, not to let them buy us? When we went to fight illegal wars to occupy the Middle East for oil?
2476 2018-08-16 18:24:14 I want both. Because Oil is not going anywhere any time soon.
2477 2018-08-16 18:23:57 It's dark in the middle of the day

2486 2018-08-16 18:22:37 Yep. Bread, meat, vegetable and oil
2487 2018-08-16 18:22:30 Me too but this sandwich was dripping with oil. Even I have my limits.
2488 2018-08-16 18:22:28 As if my car has decided today to be the day it pisses out oil, can see a fucking wonga loan coming out now
2489 2018-08-16 18:22:26 The Saudis are planning for a public IPO for Aramco - the world's biggest oil producing entity. They have a conflict of interest with @Tesla 's renewable energy vision.
2490 2018-08-16 18:22:22 Margarine? Mustard? Olive oil and vinegar? Branston pickle? Pesto? 
The choices are basically endless. 
If you gotta use a type of mayo (which is devil cum imo), at least make it aioli...
2491 2018-08-16 18:22:02 Yeh bhagwan hai kyaa? Jo log loot rehehai desh ko 60 saal se woh abhi bhi zibdaa hai, par jo desh ke liye jiyaa usko bulaa liyaa? 2G,se GJaG tak sab jindaa hai, AtalG kyun? Sayad unky liye tel (oil) ki kadhai tayaar ho raha hai. AtalG amar rahengey sadaa ke liye.
2492 2018-08-16 18:21:51 Castor oil makes me nauseous 
2493 2018-08-16 18:21:47 A couple of oil can guitars and a longhorn bass - now that would be unique 
2494 2018-08-16 18:21:36 Recharge And Get Paid Rocks
Today's seminar was mind blowing. Millionaires are popping out daily. 
My testimony is loading to the glory of God...

Telecom is the new oil block of the 21st century    
2495 2018-08-16 18:21:33 Oga sharrap! IMF, World Bank and the Min of Finance had pegged growth despite failing oil prices at 4%. What are you talking? Don't come here and distort history.
2496 2018-08-16 18:21:32 It really helps me.  Took about 3 months of taking CBD oil twice a day  but sleeping well now.
2497 2018-08-16 18:21:29 How many miles and oil changes did Vixen have
2498 2018-08-16 18:21:16 Also my grandfather was an electrical engineer who worked for Fluor and Parsons and built oil refineries expat for most of his life. He was just getting Christmas firewood in the forest on our farm. 
2499 2018-08-16 18:21:16 オリーブ油で毎日を楽しく(*^_^*)
2500 2018-08-16 18:20:52 Oh please. Our power went out for two and a half weeks a few years ago after an ice storm. sub-freezing weather. Olive oil on the countertop went solid, but survival was never in question.
2501 2018-08-16 18:20:50 Baked In the Oven and stuffed with garlic olive oil feta cheese and pine nuts
2502 2018-08-16 18:20:49 Actually fighting to steal other peoples oil is Americas main principle. Your largest exports are bombs and missiles that you are currently dropping on 8 countries that you aren't even at war with. You're backing Saudi Arabia that paid for the 911 attack.
2503 2018-08-16 18:20:45 idk why i cook in a sports bra, hot ass oil stays splashing all over me
2504 2018-08-16 18:20:32 Hate to see when that Synthol oil explodes or becomes infected. That is 100% fake.
2505 2018-08-16 18:20:30 So Zippy, apparently Keith Hernandez is really into body lotions with CBD oil. I thought this was kind of a hilarious thing to talk about on the air during a Mets game.
2506 2018-08-16 18:20:23 Effect is a noun. The effect of something. Cause and effect. Affect is a verb. A homophobe feels affected by gays. Price of oil in Saudi affects the price of gas in the US
2507 2018-08-16 18:20:14 cleansing oil - mw - fw - toner - serum - night cream
2508 2018-08-16 18:20:06 Well, at least somewhere the majority understands that the oil is not far from humanity. Glad for the Australians.
2509 2018-08-16 18:20:03 Mini egg pizzas:

Thinly slice 2 hard-boiled eggs.  Place 8 toasted English muffin halves on a baking sheet.  Brush each half with olive oil.  Top with 1 tomato slice, egg slices and 1 mozzarella cheese slice.  Broil until cheese melts.
2510 2018-08-16 18:20:01 Bigla kong naisip yung castor oil. Hahaha.
2511 2018-08-16 18:19:53 And thats the division right there. Good teams destroy mediocre pitching. This team could not hit oil can Boyd right now.
2512 2018-08-16 18:19:44 To whites God is Gold.Oil.Drugs... To Blacks God is an imaginery skydaddy up there!
2513 2018-08-16 18:19:41 Very very juicy but unfortunately we are arsenal not PSG.. Oil 
2514 2018-08-16 18:19:38 Noted. I guess I’ll wait and see if the federal government does sue some of these drug companies and, if so, on what grounds.
2515 2018-08-16 18:19:06 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
2516 2018-08-16 18:18:37 Okay, guru. I'll take my pills because you think Alex Jones is such controlled opposition. To think that you'd have to be selling some sort of snake oil. You don't have to agree with the guy about everything to see how transparent this is.
2517 2018-08-16 18:18:36 Time you remove your « leader » that groped a woman, denies canadians to live in a safe country letting in illegals, makes diplomatic errors one on top of the other one, buys oil and sold weapons from/to Saudi Arabia. Who’s more dangerous to our country? Bernier or Trudeau?
2518 2018-08-16 18:18:16 The corners were full of trash when I was there last.  Kinda pissed me off.
2519 2018-08-16 18:17:45 weapons, armor, milking cows without exhaling up their anus, farming, written language, books, epics, poetry, history, boats, wine, oil, candles, societies, politics, police

and this was all a few thousand years ago...

and everything since has been white too...
2520 2018-08-16 18:17:39 I wasn't expecting a video, I'm so happy right now!!! The Essences Banana powder looks really interesting, I must try that and I'm happy the Bio Oil helped with the stretchmarks.
2521 2018-08-16 18:16:37 That’s the start. Fajitas (peppers in limited proportions, cook with onions but don’t eat them). Top steak with a pat of butter. 

Coconut oil is ok, but MCT oil is best for making bullet proof coffee. I’ll post my new recipe in another post and tag you.
2522 2018-08-16 18:16:32 That was quick.

2524 2018-08-16 18:16:18 Where is your CBD oil sourced from?
2525 2018-08-16 18:16:17 I spent $30 on a planner for school and $160 on an essential oil diffuser, is this called being an adult?
2526 2018-08-16 18:15:58 If they have been making fraudulent claims to doctors who are prescribing their products, that’s one thing. If people are merely abusing their products and want to hold someone else responsible for doing so, that’s another thing entirely.
2527 2018-08-16 18:15:55 Check your Engine oil this afternoon.
2528 2018-08-16 18:15:53 I’m on coffee today and I burned my hand with hot ass steam on my initial oil burn from yesterday.  
I’m not crying or anything 
2529 2018-08-16 18:15:50 He didn’t sacrifice his life for USA. He sacrificed his life for Israel and for oil and mining corporations and commercial arms companies. There is nothing for USA to gain from Mideast wars but serving Israeli interests of securing occupation by taking out potential threat
2530 2018-08-16 18:15:35 So I’m making plans with my Grandpa (he is an immigrant with a heavy accent) to see where he wants to eat lunch and he keeps saying he wants to go to Olive Oil and I finally realized he was talking about Olive Garden

2533 2018-08-16 18:15:17 Does the aroma carry over? Years ago, I remember hearing about the "french fry" buses of Kingston. They used biodiesel made, I think at least in part, from used restaurant oil so their transit buses smelled like fried food.
2534 2018-08-16 18:15:15 The One Oil Industry That Isn't Under Threat
 
Peak oil demand might be near, but the consumption of oil for plastics will keep demand elevated for decades...
2535 2018-08-16 18:15:13 You finally become an adult when you go to get an oil change and ONLY get an oil change. 
No extra, expensive add ons for this adult.
Thank you have a nice day.
2536 2018-08-16 18:15:09 Without oil
2537 2018-08-16 18:15:03 I am waiting for when nollywood would start making moving round our national realities such as politics and power play with the corridor of power, niger delta and the oil curse. Could it be that there is a dearth of  creative minds with adequate information about nationhood
2538 2018-08-16 18:14:47 as even the left media  helped  out an oil company, the cia and the fbi at standing  rock. that's just how it goes. the media has been tied  to  the  CIA since  the  beginning and we live  in a corporotocracy/oligarchy/plutocracy.
2539 2018-08-16 18:14:46 Dip your bread in extra virgin olive oil instead of mayonnaise or butter and get a good dose of healthy fats instead of unhealthy ones.
2540 2018-08-16 18:14:39 the rocks are just another way to kill enemies considering it's harder to hit them that way so you get double the points for those kills..the bottles are bottles of oil they are 1ups then there are sparkplugs that are continues..yellow fuel is super fuel which

2545 2018-08-16 18:13:52 Hey. What are the benefits of the Aloe Spray?
And what are the 5 oils that are mixed together in your hair oil? 
Told my colleagues about you guys and we wanna make a bulk purchase at month end.
2546 2018-08-16 18:13:50 So, a wee tip on dandelions. You can eat the leaves. They're delicious, washed, steamed and then mixed with some olive oil and lemon juice, salt etc
2547 2018-08-16 18:13:37 Secret oil fields.  Think they are at Faslane and they can't access them.  Aye right!

2551 2018-08-16 18:13:07 You'd think a @NYCMayor who wants to blame oil companies for #climatechange would also want to hit them where it hurts by reducing gas consumption on the city's fleet — and among city residents — but I don't see that happening with BDB

2554 2018-08-16 18:12:25 In any first time new agri-plantation of, Soya, Canola, or Palm Oil in any new area will naturally have deforestation. That is normal. Meet & Discuss is needed to minimise the issue. Condemn & Attack is not a solution.
2555 2018-08-16 18:12:13 I would get sick every year until I started rotating it in. I tried everything before that. One year I did oil of oregano and it was awful and still got sick
2556 2018-08-16 18:12:10 nothing like the smell of burning oil in the morning.. no worries though cause I love my subaru
2557 2018-08-16 18:12:05 What a absolute crazy shift today... went out at 2.30,  just walked back in the cabin... train spotters heaven today with all the remarshalling ive had to do.
At least the shift has flown,  caked in oil,  get me in that shower
2558 2018-08-16 18:11:43 Pour some oil and vinegar on that mother fucker
2559 2018-08-16 18:11:42 Nah fuck that the secret is tea tree oil and vitamin e oil
2560 2018-08-16 18:11:19 If you think tobacco and oil are equivalent to livestock and livestock products, we're at an impasse. We'll have to agree to disagree.
2561 2018-08-16 18:11:14 I ask my dad a question about general life topics daily. Today's topic: Oil Change
2562 2018-08-16 18:11:03 Oil Can Boyd pls
2563 2018-08-16 18:11:02 I don't buy anything with Palm Oil. Purchasing Power by the consumer.
2564 2018-08-16 18:10:48 Again, you're thinking that replicating the model means repeating every step. Oil exports aren't the only funding approach.

Yes, the grid can be green.

Are you philosophically opposed to the goal, emotionally disturbed by change, or do you personally profit from how things are?
2565 2018-08-16 18:10:44 I recall a friend receiving a ass whooping after he emptied the little cooking oil that was left in that container
2566 2018-08-16 18:10:38 I am 23 and getting an oil change for the first time.
2567 2018-08-16 18:10:35 put too much MCT oil in my tea today

2582 2018-08-16 18:08:40 Ask Pashtuns they will tell u what Pak cowards army did to them..so oil ur own machine
2583 2018-08-16 18:08:29 Also, next time cite an actual climate scientist, not a climate-denying oil executive who can't even get his axis labels right.
2584 2018-08-16 18:08:18 Okay this has nothing to do with the palettes buuut is that like an essential oil thing? The crystal glass  it’s gorgeous and now I want it
2585 2018-08-16 18:08:17 Irving doesnt have the capability to refine tar sands. Energy East wouldve built 22 oil tanks in Saint john next to an export terminal sending a supertanker everyday and a half likely to houston texas
2586 2018-08-16 18:08:16 I disagree. The world massively underinvested in capex throughout 14-16. It is not a 90 day wonder to create new capacity. I never said run out of oil but it is a fact that at average depletion of 4.5pct annual this is not being replaced.
2587 2018-08-16 18:08:15 @realDonaldTrump @StateDept @USEmbassyAbuja @nikkihaley 

See how Buhari’s govt is using oil money from Biafra-land to fund #BokoHaram.

Do u still need reason to leave Nig?

Pls support #BiafraExit #BiafraReferendum #FreeBiafra to cut off oil money for the sponsor of #terrorism.
2588 2018-08-16 18:08:09 None of the above. How about Oil can Boyd and The only Nolan. Or Full pack Stanhouse.

2592 2018-08-16 18:07:39 Supply growth includes oil and gas, perhaps better measured by miles of installed pipeline capacity. Bottom line is their oil and gas production has grown substantially, all enabled by massive infrastructure growth.

2596 2018-08-16 18:07:02 Its confusing but I think I get a sense of it. Unfortunately Trump has been far worse even then I feared and has proceeded to give oil pipeline construction free rein without even relying on this conspiracy
2597 2018-08-16 18:06:59 All due to climate change which Republicans have turned their heads to fill their pockets w $$$$ from the oil & gas companies.  Americans aren’t stupid. We know the truth.  Over 70% of Americans want clean energy. Not dirty air, water, land.
2598 2018-08-16 18:06:43 I'll make a donation of wood and oil.
2599 2018-08-16 18:06:38 Hey Colby, maybe you could have mentioned that neither TMX nor Energy East would transport "oil" fro domestic consumption, but rather dilbit for export. Moving bitumen to tidewater does not provide oil to domestic markets in any real way. Why is this so rarely mentioned?
2600 2018-08-16 18:06:32 Unhealthy foods are marketed as healthy: energy bars, yogurt, cereal, canola oil. The Biggest Loser says exercise is the solution, NOT. We can 'blame' marketers, but we're responsible for educating ourselves and that takes time. Note: people watch on average of 5 hrs of TV a day.
2601 2018-08-16 18:06:10 If you take your car in for an oil change, and they tell you you need more windshield wiper fluid; did the oil make the fluid dry up?
2602 2018-08-16 18:05:58 Are you typing about NI or the Republic of Ireland?

I use Heating Oil myself and just checked prices: NI is currently about £30 _cheaper_ than Scotland to buy 900l and ROI prices are around £60 cheaper.

Rip off Britain strikes again.
At that point I guessed you make up shit ...
2603 2018-08-16 18:05:43 I can tell we will never agree but I'll answer a couple of your questions.
I turned 61 yesterday.
Water is not a limited resource like oil exept in places like Las Vegas.
My toilet was just a convenient example.
Trump was not my first choice.
I'm also pissed at GOP.
2604 2018-08-16 18:05:36 And for the US shale is expected to grow at a brisk pace but from the negative cash flow results of many of the oil cos. it is clear that they are facing an uphill battle with depletion.
2605 2018-08-16 18:05:24 I cannot. Regardless of The Garden’s business model, they have the support of the/a culture. As much they put too much dang oil in their pesto (RIP my stummy), I’ve never felt as though Olive Garden has wanted me dead. The same cannot be said for R*lly’s...
2606 2018-08-16 18:05:11 The indemnity clause in this fucking oil and gas lease is basically an M.C. Escher painting represented with words. Except not in any cool way. Just totally redundant and overwrought
2607 2018-08-16 18:04:45 Saddam: I won't sell my oil for dollars, they killed him.
Kadhafi: I won't trade in dollars, they killed him.
Ahmedinajad (iran): let's use Lira to pay, put him offline.
Arabs: wanted to use Chinese Yuan, they all ended in jail...

2612 2018-08-16 18:03:26 You think this oil is free??
2613 2018-08-16 18:03:21 I disagree on Brazil. Petrobras is very strapped for cash (largest corp debtor in the world) and the CEO has made it clear there will be no new investments at current oil prices. And Congress has made it very hard for him to sell assets.

2617 2018-08-16 18:02:53 They're too dumb to care. I'm not being mean but most of them seem incapable of critical thinking or to recognize they're voting against themselves. They think they're buying Canola oil when in fact it's "snake oil" Trump is selling them.
2618 2018-08-16 18:02:47 All the oil field workers!! They like the flannels

2620 2018-08-16 18:02:21 China lacks basic resources per capita, they lack everything, oil, minerals, food (yes, food), they even lack fresh water. To them it is a vital need to expand. China couldn't live on its own resources (whereas the US, Russia, Europe, could).

2628 2018-08-16 18:01:23 Republicans have been taking many, many rubles.
It can’t be oil. That’s Trump’s m.o., for sure, but it doesn’t make sense here.
His status on the world stage is being elevated, but Putin will never give it up (what else does he have?), and we won’t go to war with Russia.

2635 2018-08-16 18:00:44 Stop bombing other people's countries for their oil, water & other resources including human to enslave them & find out. We ARE all ONE PEOPLE, ONE PLANET under ONE GOD. Ask George Soros & the other "BILLIONAIRES" what Europe should be.

2639 2018-08-16 18:00:23 Yes! What Lou said! I love the Sephora cream lipstains. $14.00, super long wearing, you can eat or drink with them on and it’ll stay put unless you’re eating something heavily oil based.

2641 2018-08-16 18:00:21 They all have massive spare capacity, if they wanted to invest the capex....spare capacity is defined as production within 90 days, which is totally different. You make it sound like they all ran out of oil.

2647 2018-08-16 17:59:56 Let's hope the quality of oil is better than the sound quality of this interview! Please sort a decent microphone out next time Simon...I gave up listening after 50 secs as it's mainly inaudible.

2649 2018-08-16 17:59:41 My first grade teacher called my mother because I colored outside the lines. My mother (who is an oil painter) promptly went to the school and gave her an earful. I currently paint abstract and have never been much of a creative rule follower.

2655 2018-08-16 17:59:00 .@BLMAlaska is in a rushed, oil-fueledrace to open the #ArcticRefuge to seismic exploration. Hey @SecretaryZinke – harassing baby polar bears is more than just a bad PR move. The country is watching and like the warming #Arctic, you're already on thin ice. #ProtectTheArctic
2656 2018-08-16 17:58:43 Do me and mom are getting her car’s oil changed and she goes, “Look theyre gonna say, ‘That will be $60.’” Then she proceeds to hold up a coupon for a free oil change and goes, “How about, that will be IN YOUR FACE!”
2657 2018-08-16 17:58:39 Idk I'm really interested in knowing I feel like they have this particular smell like oil or plastic????

2659 2018-08-16 17:58:02 It's important to separate fiscal from economic matters. Ownership aside, the oil industry is classically boom and bust. The AB government OTOH does not need to be as vulnerable to these swings, but Albertans historically preferred low taxes to fiscal sustainability.
2660 2018-08-16 17:57:49 Money I just dropped on this oil change

2663 2018-08-16 17:57:37 Without its oil, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia would look like Sudan or Somalia. Because of its oil, leaders of countries that should know better bow before a brutal, backward, misogynistic, incestuous royal family.

2664 2018-08-16 17:57:31 Atleast when I put on oil filters they don’t leak
2665 2018-08-16 17:57:24 It’s truly the biggest mystery to me after all this time? WTF is going on w/ trump his entire administration  transition team & the Republican Party w/ Russia?  Why suddenly does America only care about Russia? It has to be oil there’s nothing else that makes sense!
2666 2018-08-16 17:57:19 A new Refinery is being built in Southwest Texas with more to come now that we have a president that is not repressing our oil industry.
2667 2018-08-16 17:57:16 I absolutely cannot wait until Crazy Bernie is the nominee, and we get to have this debate on a national scale.
2668 2018-08-16 17:56:53 If it wasn’t for misa, I don’t know when my oil needs to be changed lol

2681 2018-08-16 17:55:54 They beat the oil footprint!
So what is your point?
If you are looking at new technologies footprints why are you blind to oil and gas?
2682 2018-08-16 17:55:48 Nigeria in extreme poverty.... 
Large expanse of land available. 
Largest oil deposit in Africa and 7th in the world.
Mineral resources enough. 
Marine economay high but untouched. 
Human resources enough. 
I think animal kingdom is better than us...
2683 2018-08-16 17:55:32 India faced so many problems like
Devastating Earthquake (2001)
Cyclones (1999 and 2000)
Worst Drought (2002-2003)
Gulf War II & Oil Crisis (2003)
Kargil War (1999)
Parliament Attack etc.
But Shri Ataljee tackled all. India saw a Golden Period under his leadership.

2684 2018-08-16 17:55:14 Almond oil works wonders
2685 2018-08-16 17:55:14 ya put a pan on the stove, spray it with some olive oil. throw your bread on there like a tortilla. And toast that ho
2686 2018-08-16 17:55:06 Shaving legs using coconut oil > shaving legs using nair
2687 2018-08-16 17:55:06 we find only one barrel of new oil for every ten that we burn

In any business that means bankruptcy
2688 2018-08-16 17:54:49 I have the same problem. I've recently been roasting a lot of veggies on a big cookie sheet: cauliflower, broccolini, carrots, zucchini etc. (Put he carrots in first, they take the longest.) One drop of olive oil on each, and tiny bit of salt when they're done. Yum. Good luck!
2689 2018-08-16 17:54:43 The Dems realize their 20% of the pot from Oil & Gas is a minority share in the ownership of the party. Unlike the Reps who are all but bought & paid for with their 80% share of the pot. Exactly who is representing the people of the USA? Only the 1's who rejected PAC money.
2690 2018-08-16 17:54:39 overheard while getting my car’s oil changed:

being a manager at that store is fuckin stressful! it’s not wonder tim’s off his fuckin rocker
2691 2018-08-16 17:54:34 No you did not but that was not the point of my argument my argument was in you supporting the regime of Gaddafi, you highlighted his economic growth without mentioning the boom of oil prices around the same time and how this man was conflicted in what he chose to support anyway
2692 2018-08-16 17:54:31 I fucking know the perfume oil seller..

2693 2018-08-16 17:54:08 Confused - why he is so good in practice/ jug machine. But in a game dude has olive oil on his hands.
2694 2018-08-16 17:53:58 My investments have tanked. American steel and oil. Explain that. 
2695 2018-08-16 17:53:50 He's either preparing himself for the mess of topping up your oil with one of those nasty oil spouts that you'd push through the top of the can, or he's saying, "come at me bro"
2696 2018-08-16 17:53:45 We didn't have to fundamentally change human nature to put men into orbit.

Ignoring that you're *really* underestimating just how much oil we'd have to export, your fantasy of a mostly green grid would hamstring oil's profitability as an export, as others would do same.

2700 2018-08-16 17:52:37 for your mind Akpabio is honest, its the fear of EfCC that made him to defect because APC  has turned to where you can hide after you have robe oil for hands
2701 2018-08-16 17:52:21 24k Pere...  Its not even much...  Pls can I have the fufu and palm oil alone?  Thank u
2702 2018-08-16 17:51:36 You’ve got to be a lobbyist for the oil industry? Otherwise your whole life doesn’t make any sense
2703 2018-08-16 17:51:34 Russian population dwarfed the German one by more than 2:1, the Russians had endless oil supplies. And third, like they defeated Napoleons “Grand Army” before, Russians didn’t plan on defending their lands like the “civilized” Western Europeans. Russia depleted German resources.
2704 2018-08-16 17:51:29 Anything to get that git @jamieoliver off the bloody telly!

2707 2018-08-16 17:51:15 *CLUNK*

My thoughts are interrupted by the sound of a heavy lock giving way to its master, followed by the *creak* of the cell door hinge in bad need of oil.

2742 2018-08-16 17:46:39 the big oil industry is literally sending books telling Teacher’s climate change isn’t real.

2743 2018-08-16 17:46:33 The body shop has all natural products with tea tree oil in them that can help blemished skin. There is also an over the counter product called differin that can help treat acne. Many acne products may make things worse (like severe drying) before they get better
2744 2018-08-16 17:45:59 Rather an honest, blunt, genius man like @realdonaldtrump than a snake oil, smooth, dishonest, sneaky, lying fraud like @barackobama.  Lied about his birth, his religion and possibly even his wife and children (transgender and rent-a-children??).  Why are his records sealed?
2745 2018-08-16 17:45:53 Too much oil Ethan
2746 2018-08-16 17:45:44 You can think whatever you'd like, but that doesn't make your ideals any less implausible. Also, the oil is for exporting, not domestic consumption, you dunce.

2748 2018-08-16 17:45:14 only because I was the best fielder we had.
2749 2018-08-16 17:45:09 In fact BC's provincial gov't has been on the right side of this issue. It is the Federal government which purchased the Kinder Morgan oil pipeline, in effect giving a huge new lease of life to fossil fuel development in Canada.
2750 2018-08-16 17:45:08 As long as human sustenance depends on fossil fuels (petro-fertilizers-pesticides), a non renewable resource that is depleted at enormous rates and past peak extraction, we are guaranteeing hunger and suffering for humans for as many generations as we feed on oil. Agriculture=Oil
2751 2018-08-16 17:45:03 yes, they stand together, but when Q falls, they will all scatter like rats deserting a sinking ship.

The problem with arguing with Qbies is they are trying to defend some of the legit info dropped while overly protecting an enclave of false profits and snake oil salesmen
2752 2018-08-16 17:45:02 We have a local buying group here that for the first few years was generally cheaper. This changed though and got comparably more expensive. I find it’s cheaper now to phone around myself and get several prices. Oil Suppliers always reduce the price per litre when challenged.
2753 2018-08-16 17:44:57 What I do with my tofu: cut it in half longways, then strips, then cubes.

Heat up 1 tbsp of oil in a wide pan on medium heat, dump in the tofu, and take it out until it’s crispy enough for my liking.
2754 2018-08-16 17:44:55 All AutoImmune Disease sufferers would do well to dose daily with concentrated cannabis oil / RSO / Phoenix Tears, for symptom relief & actual healing. I dropped 9 toxic Rx chemotherapy medications & I haven’t been this healthy in years.

2755 2018-08-16 17:44:48 I don't get it. How and why would TYT help and oil company? Evidence?
2756 2018-08-16 17:44:46 Birds of a feather... both think we should get our oil from Saudi, Venezuela, Nigeria and so on, anywhere but Alberta.
2757 2018-08-16 17:44:41 imagine that, anon and muscles, like oil and water that. hue
2758 2018-08-16 17:44:39 Rlly confused as to why everyone in the gym decided it was ok to smell like fish oil??? Halp plz?? SOS???
2759 2018-08-16 17:44:19 I'm surprised they can't clean these Algae Blooms and Red Tides like an oil slick, if they are hazardous.
2760 2018-08-16 17:44:19 You guys are thinking too American though.. shit in Canada is more expensive a basic oil change costs $60 no matter where you go and free doesn’t exist
2761 2018-08-16 17:44:14 Daily or as-needed cleaning of your granite counter tops or other natural-stone surface will reduce dirt, oil penetration and water spotting.
2762 2018-08-16 17:44:02 Throwback to when I was IN TEARS after a swim practice bc I saw a mouse in a glue trap and I was trying to save it. People really had to ask my coach for a pen to help me save it. BUT I DID, OLIVE OIL WORKS LIKE A DREAM
2763 2018-08-16 17:44:01 The problem is deforestation, and unsustainable use of palm oil.  It's a global problem but needs local solutions 
2764 2018-08-16 17:43:55 Their ingredients are literally coconut oil in a gummy bear it’s such a scam
2765 2018-08-16 17:43:46 i just consumed tea tree oil wow i can't wait to die
2766 2018-08-16 17:43:44 Good deal. I tried to prep it the same way, but the squash wasn't stringy at all. I probably just used too much oil. We'll see how round 2 goes!
2767 2018-08-16 17:43:41 Don't need "right wing media outlets" to tell me unemployment rate is 4.1%, or black unemployment is 9%, an absolute record low. That tariffs work: China quietly backed off on its new, high tariff on oil. So much out there. Facts. Do some research. What msm won't tell you.
2768 2018-08-16 17:43:39 Insalata caprese—Roma tomatoes, big mozzarella, fresh basil, basalmic vinegar and olive oil. Use the freshest ingredients you can get and don’t chill the tomatoes. Delightful! If you’re ovo-lactio veg

2770 2018-08-16 17:43:28 I bought a dirt scented fragrance oil and I love it. It smells just like fresh potting soil. I also bought a tomato leaf one and tested it against real tomato leaves and it is pretty darn close. I'm not sure what sort of garden soap is in the works, but I'm making something. XD
2771 2018-08-16 17:43:24 Ima have ya body sweatin like u dipped in baby oil
2772 2018-08-16 17:43:15 Tofu absorbs oil and seasoning like a sponge so it’s like an all around delicious not just the skin 
2773 2018-08-16 17:43:15 À good name is better than good oil: une bonne réputation  vaut mieux qu'une bonne apparence: les bonnes qualités honorent plus que l'apparence extérieur.
2774 2018-08-16 17:43:06 Because they are cooked with peanut oil.
2775 2018-08-16 17:43:03 Que oil comprate?

2780 2018-08-16 17:42:33 Go to Nickerson Road Auto Repair & Services and mention the AHS Student Council when getting an oil change and they will make a $20 donation. @waitt4community
2781 2018-08-16 17:42:30 Okay.

Seriously, this is a nation that used to thrive on doing big things, taking on the big challenges, because the goal was worth the challenge. Not only do I think we could do it, I think we could drop in oil use for our energy needs at the same time.
2782 2018-08-16 17:42:25 Of course they wanna colonize mars their oil is killing earth
2783 2018-08-16 17:42:22 i saw someone post "wow news article about disney worker who drowned in oil!???!!!!" and someone corrected them that its wasnt actually a disney worker, but neither cited shit? and then google didnt help. so ive blocked them both now

2786 2018-08-16 17:41:34 Really?! You're the one equating the two!  Why don't you go tell Coke, Pfizer, 3M, and Marathon Oil how you feel about them doing business with Saudi Arabia.  Sit the fuck down.
2787 2018-08-16 17:41:05 You did amazing love. I can tell you did a oil pastel drawing so it will be a bit difficult to add detail, especially when you have to blend in your colors to make it lighter or darker, Or it will smudge a lot. Oil pastels is a difficult medium Work with, next time use chalk or
2788 2018-08-16 17:41:00 I get out and decide to check the oil, at first thinking transmission...oil isn't terribly dirty, but chick needs a new dipstick. Shit was bent as fuck...So other brown dude. Look, 3 of us were literally brown people (ethnically), but I was the only American (and mixed) of us 3.

2793 2018-08-16 17:40:31 I came in for a quick oil change. I left with new tires and a warning that baby car might be burning oil.
2794 2018-08-16 17:40:27 You should always coat the bowl or plate you are using with olive oil spray or oil itself before cooking to make it easier to clean
2795 2018-08-16 17:40:22 i gotta stick to oil cleansing. other method are just

2797 2018-08-16 17:40:04 Toss the kale with virgin oil, chilli flakes and black pepper then bake it for 15ish mins at 150 degrees Celsius (keep checking it as it burns quickly). Actually amazing! As for the chard, bin?
2798 2018-08-16 17:40:00 Oh no! All is well tho? You probably need a detox from the chemo in your body. Oil of oregano and activated charocal!
2799 2018-08-16 17:39:55 Plus, you know, THE DAMN TANK FARM BARELY FEET AWAY is a much, much bigger risk. But it has a police guard and governmental support because God help anyone who tries to keep us from our oil.
2800 2018-08-16 17:39:29 We're going to have to go through some massive cultural and demographic changes if you want to replicate any Nordic model. And a lot more oil as well.

2802 2018-08-16 17:39:22 Pull up to Jiffy Lube to get my oil changed. Told the guy I had a Groupon voucher for an oil change. He said, “man where y’all be gettin these?!” ....uh, Groupon sir

2805 2018-08-16 17:38:56 As per my knowledge permissible limit of total polar compound is set as 25% and with reused cooking oil we breach that limit and it is unsafe too for consumption..Why cant we use ...Used cooking oil for biodiesel production

Please don't forget Kohat. Try to bring mega projects to Kohat e.g., Oil refinery, additional deptts in KUST, women University for kohat... Rest u have more exposure than us

Fuel Price spike is now un-avoidable 2020-2022.
2809 2018-08-16 17:38:37 Are you taking cannabis oil every single day in doses strong enough. Because it does. I'm not referring to just getting high.
2810 2018-08-16 17:38:30 In refixing the economy, Nigeria needs someone in person of Dr @bukolasaraki who can take bull by the horns.

2821 2018-08-16 17:36:38 Confectioneries' singara are good. Less oil. Many nuts.  Sometimes liver, and very big. But most of them has old smell. Roadside singaras are fresh but the oil is deadly. Golden food has good singaras.
2822 2018-08-16 17:36:36 You are a grifting dolt. You would rather take the security clearance away from a Brennan who served for more than 5 decades with honor, than admit you’re a snake oil salesman, traitor and Russian conspirator.  Your loyalties to treasonous Trump will land you rightfully in prison
2823 2018-08-16 17:36:31 @Nissan Really unhappy to find my immaculately dealer maintained Qashqai 1.2 dig-T had no oil in the engine despite weekly checking! I have been billed £8,300 for a new engine!!! Disgusting. Not getting a penny out of me. Not even offered a courtesy car!
2824 2018-08-16 17:36:28 Get you some black Jamaican castor oil bro lol
2825 2018-08-16 17:36:10 you'd think people in the left media would never be infiltrators, get infiltrators, get  mercenaries, get agent provoceteurs &be agent provoceteurs to help out an oil co, the CIA & The FBI. Facts can stranger than fiction. Looks like TYT, The Intercept, Unicorn Riot,
2826 2018-08-16 17:35:59 I wipe the chain, lube it, turn the crank a few times, then wipe it again. Too much oil is nearly as bad as not enough, but it depends on the viscosity. You'll end up with grit in it, or oil over everything.
2827 2018-08-16 17:35:58 #OIl is dead, #RenewableEnergy is NOW!  Support it any way possible and help end big oils icy grip once and for all.. !
2828 2018-08-16 17:35:51 Electing an unbeknown snake oil salesman twice whose background was meticulously hidden from the people is as close to socialism I want the US to get to. Trump is the proverbial bull in the china shop. We must show up in droves come November. What happened in MN is not acceptable
2829 2018-08-16 17:35:47 Hes growing it out! Thats why i bought da beard oil!
2830 2018-08-16 17:35:33 A guy comes in for an 80k service on his Volvo, going over the service he mentions the oil was changed at 65k and asks if it is necessary to do it again yeah bud probably a good idea
2831 2018-08-16 17:35:21 @ENERGY said it simply: #PRIMARYenergy sources take many forms, including #nuclearenergy, fossil energy-like #oil, #coal & #naturalgas- & #renewablesources like #wind, #solar, #geothermal & #hydropower. These primary sources are converted to electricity, a #SECONDARYenergy source
2832 2018-08-16 17:35:18 Just enough to coat the inside, then I flip it over to trap the oil inside and cook it on a tinfoil covered baking sheet.  After I scrape out all the stringy squash, I typically add just a bit more salt/pepper to taste then mix it all up.
2833 2018-08-16 17:35:08 My hair been growing thanks to that tea tree oil

2835 2018-08-16 17:35:02 If you are careful a standard pack of pine nuts (most expensive part, buy if on sale) will easy do two batches. But literally no diff in price (if you have olive oil to hand--we have couple of versions cheap stuff for cooking; better stuff for pesto & salads) but huge diff taste!

2839 2018-08-16 17:34:14 I don't see nationalizing the oil industry. A taxpayer-owned participant in the oil industry (Petro-Can) was too much for AB. The temporary ownership of a pipeline project has them in a lather. They want their subsidies and supports to be hidden for self-respect purposes.
2840 2018-08-16 17:34:06 Canadian oil producers, CVE SU CNQ face oil price discounts over transport bottlenecks, and U.S. refineries and pipeline builders.

TransCanada hopes to start preliminary work in Montana in the coming months and to begin construction in 2019. 

Project is $8 Billion
2841 2018-08-16 17:33:48 I was getting my oil changed and used my phone through the car to blast it in the shop for everyone when we found out.

2847 2018-08-16 17:33:23 I used salt water to try to make it go away for like two weeks bc i couldn’t find any tea tree oil at umd but i finally found some tea tree oil and it made mine go away in literally a day

2855 2018-08-16 17:32:34 i can guarantee that you 2 probably know more about cars/motors than me, but i was fucked and had a cracked head gasket, so my coolant was all up in my oil and had to get like 5 changes rapidly.
2856 2018-08-16 17:32:26 Awesome! Thanks Jordan! Can someone take a few more pics if you’re there supporting in person? Trying to find my families names 
2857 2018-08-16 17:32:18 Never! But I am curious. Do you fry the halloumi or do you eat it fresh? It must be delicious. Do you add anything else? Herbs? Olive oil?
2858 2018-08-16 17:32:17 At best, SEO is snake oil.
2859 2018-08-16 17:32:05 No worries. I work in a State Govt. Agency that regulates oil and gas production in the state also do some work with the State Geological Survey. The work can be mind numbing at times.
2860 2018-08-16 17:31:59 Now that I’ve gotten my new car it cost TWICE as much to get an oil change 
2861 2018-08-16 17:31:57 I am about to go get another oil change as a last ditch effort.  Is your foot feeling any better?!
2862 2018-08-16 17:31:49 Getting a MUCH needed oil change. Note to self....don’t let the car get 2 quarts low. In my defense the last place I went for an oil change didn’t have any stickers to remind me! Heck yeah I’m blaming them! 
2863 2018-08-16 17:31:45 I mean there are obstacles that could either go left or right with this but I mean its a really great idea. It creates more job opportunities. Prevents plastic bottles/glass/paper or what have you. Doesn’t really solve liquid pollution such as oil. But I mean this would help
2864 2018-08-16 17:31:44 talk to @Media_PPP about how media on the left helped to fuck over Standing Rock protesters & helped out an oil co, FBI & CIA. Also some Native Americans sold out  their own people for $ at Standing  Rock & did nefarious actions. This is a huge story yet not many want to touch it

2868 2018-08-16 17:31:13 This dude doing mine tried giving me the more expensive oil because I had a bad leak, but I was like, “That’s not my oil, that’s my power steering fluid” and he argued with me so the manager came out and was like, “Dude.. that IS power steering fluid..” 
2869 2018-08-16 17:31:06 Nice, I'll try prepping it that exact way next week! How much oil do you put on yours?

2877 2018-08-16 17:30:06 I don't support a party that takes money from health insurance CEOs, when that money came from kids dying of cancer.

2880 2018-08-16 17:29:19 2 hours for an oil change............ok 
2881 2018-08-16 17:29:18 Sour cude will be in less demand. Another hit to Canada's all in bet on the oil sands.
2882 2018-08-16 17:29:12 But there's so much to keep in the ground, it comes to my earlier point- we'll beat this more by inducing cheaper alternatives and raising carbon prices than tinkering at the margins of oil supply and demand, since we're entering an age of oil abundance (given demand reductions)
2883 2018-08-16 17:29:11 Usually they do air filter every time they change oil, but it’s like included for no extra fee. Ditch that place lol.
2884 2018-08-16 17:29:09 Canada's increasingly absurd Conservative Party STILL blames Pierre Trudeau & NEP for the world oil crisis at the time, which is absolutely nonsensical. It's incoherent rambling from a bunch of puny-brained, fuddy-duddy old angry white guys who need a hook to hang their stupid on
2885 2018-08-16 17:28:58 Did you you oil spray on your dish before you placed egg in it?  It works pretty well
2886 2018-08-16 17:28:53 What the fuck does Scottish Football and Newcastle have to do with Usmamov? Dearly me what a awful article. Bet this jamoke didn’t write this in 2008 when the oil man got involved with Man City. Good Lord
2887 2018-08-16 17:28:53 I found a new beard oil, it’s lit
2888 2018-08-16 17:28:52 Literally, al i oli means garlic and oil in Catalan. El maestro is right.
2889 2018-08-16 17:28:41 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other
2890 2018-08-16 17:28:39 So if you're going to act like Bernie was the problem, when white women were the ones who voted for Trump over HRC, that's on you.

Personally, I don't support a party that says they're for the environment, and then goes back on their word of not accepting oil company $$$.
2891 2018-08-16 17:28:27 *applies a few drops of hair oil*
not enough
*2 more drops*
hair is drenched and dripping with oil what the heck
2892 2018-08-16 17:28:19 I hope GoI just tells trump: we are going to buy oil from Iran unless you want to give us cheaper
2893 2018-08-16 17:28:16 don’t have a hammer so i’m nailing things in my room using my jar of coconut oil
2894 2018-08-16 17:28:08 Why did they put Killian Dain in a singlet? I mean come on. What was wrong with him being shirtless? I know he got a hairy chest and oil on him, but is that going to kill people when they watch him? Cause it's not killing me.
2895 2018-08-16 17:27:49 oil changes are like $30 tops unless you have a high end car.  my Quicklube does ONLY Coolant and Oil Changes and I'm there enough that they recommend me to visit a real garage if they see something, or were bored and fixed my turn signals on a whim.
2896 2018-08-16 17:27:46 Is tea tree oil, neem toothpaste safe?
2897 2018-08-16 17:27:40 Dr. Richard Huntsman & CARE-E study on treatment resistant epileptic encephalopathy in pediatric cases led out of @usask. This is a critical research program looking at the impact of cannabidiol oil as a component of therapies for these challenging cases #scrs18 @PattisonKids
2898 2018-08-16 17:27:37 IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT OIL FUNDS AND FUELS CANADA'S ECONOMY - WITHOUT A PIPELINE THE ENTIRE COUNTRY SUFFERERS INCLUDING THOSE INUIT GROUPS WHO BENEFIT FROM THOSE OIL TAX DOLLARS.
2899 2018-08-16 17:27:18 On that we certainly agree. And maybe a good place to spend a bit of California or Norway's voters' climate goodwill? With the bonus that if there are cheaper abatement policies elsewhere, their oil sectors may live to see another day

2901 2018-08-16 17:27:09 my parents are giving me an early bday gift...paying for my oil change and wash.
2902 2018-08-16 17:26:33 No @LenMcCluskey that would be YOU.  You just poured oil on troubled waters with your absurd and offensive article.  All you’ve done is prove how vile @UKLabour really is (like we didn’t already know).  #appalling.
2903 2018-08-16 17:26:20 On 8th day, metzora brings an asham, Hatat and Olah, with a log of olive oil.
2904 2018-08-16 17:25:45 Which brings me to another quibble with @BorensteinS - he suggests limiting supply doesn't have knock-on benefits of, say, EVs.  Doesn't grappling more directly with oil, going more directly at a "bad", also have knock-on benefits? Certainly social scientists would tell us 'yes'
2905 2018-08-16 17:25:37 similar to exporting crude oil and importing petroleum products! 

Nigeria  - we hail thee!
2906 2018-08-16 17:25:23 Like I feel bad for the idiots that fall for anything they add on. Trying to tell me they’re better than my mechanic? Nah he’s a certified mechanic, you work in a fucking oil service gtfo
2907 2018-08-16 17:25:17 Out for pizza in Huddersfield. Pizza with olives, mushrooms, hummus, artichoke and garlic oil. Mmmm. Oh, and vegan cheese. 
2908 2018-08-16 17:25:13 Took Dakotas truck to get an oil change this morning and when it was done the guy came up to me and was saying “Mrs. Pitts your truck is done” and I didn’t think he was talking to me until I realized I am Mrs. Pitts

2911 2018-08-16 17:24:18 @Crof How are the Liberals not sellouts to KSA too? They're trying to fix trade relations. They've been selling weapons and buying oil from KSA for 3 years. All with a country whose HR violations shouldn't be anywhere near compatible with Canada on any level.

2917 2018-08-16 17:23:26 #Egypt's growing economic problems will heighten the appeal of the #MuslimBrotherhood 's vision of a just #Islamic society. Declining revenues from oil, tourism and remittances are depressing the already low standard of living.
2918 2018-08-16 17:23:18 Nope. He can't possibly veer from his plan to annihilate the oil producing western provinces.
2919 2018-08-16 17:23:10 At one time US Standard Oil controlled like 90% of oil supply. During that time prices continued to drop and by time anti-trust legislation was brought against them they were down to like 70%. Markets are vicious monopoly busters.
2920 2018-08-16 17:23:09 Agree, C pricing pretty perfect, in theory.  But prices nowhere near, I mean nowhere near, high enough to get at oil consumption / transportation much.  We need more, faster, to have chance at 2 deg goal.

2925 2018-08-16 17:22:33 Lavender Essential oil roller bottle. I also recommend maybe some Roman chamomile. These two together seem to have almost a sedative effect on me. I calm instantly.
2926 2018-08-16 17:22:30 A man’s walking down the beach when he finds an old oil lamp.
He rubs it and *POOF*, a genie comes out.
Genie: For freeing me, I will grant you one wish.
Man: I want to be an expert at talking to women.
So the genie turned him gay.

2928 2018-08-16 17:22:26 Good lord.  So you're spouting it's all true except not yet.  Well thank god for this reasoning.  Hopefully we can get some more oil value before it matters.  Well done Blair
2929 2018-08-16 17:22:06 Your talking point are beyond old.  They have mold and mildew all over them.  I guess Halliburton, Blood for Oil, Koch Brothers, foreign policy stuck in the 80s and all the other talking points are out of vogue now, huh?

2955 2018-08-16 17:19:31 Yes! Give it a go (you will never go back). 2-3 cloves garlic first then bung other ingredients in (pack of basil, 1/2 cup parm, 1/2 pack pine nuts, 2-3 T olive oil)
2956 2018-08-16 17:19:24 One time, I bought fish oil pills to help with mental concentration and left them on a hot stove where they melted before I can take any and, anyway, I think that just about sums up life.

2972 2018-08-16 17:18:02 I don't disagree, but isn't that the nature of a global market like oil?  How would one ever know the specific reasons for any given oil price change or specific new oil development in a lower income country?  That is what leads us to looking at fundamentals of supply&demand

2985 2018-08-16 17:16:56 Hi Matt, Oil boiler, that mean it’s a big country pile then?
Off the top of my head no but I’ll ask around for you. I’m sure a couple of the lads I know do oil.
2986 2018-08-16 17:16:55 Are you selling out to big oil as well?
2987 2018-08-16 17:16:54 Do you not recall Bush, Dupont, Ford, all the other scum bags who supported Nazis. Chase,  JP Moragn, Big Oil, tobacco.... All Republican, all racists.

2993 2018-08-16 17:16:12 The point is natural nations grow naturally, their population divides the resources amongst each, but when a small artificial state is created from it, it usually cuts off a lot of the resources and gives it to a tiny number of people. (E.b US using Kurds to cut of Syria’s oil).

I have never cooked it, but my Greek friend says the key is to use a vat of olive oil (assuming you're slow-cooking it).
3008 2018-08-16 17:14:28 Not necessarily; at least not for northern countries.  Norway appears to have prudently managed its oil revenues, but I do fear that the Oil Fund will be mismanaged due to its increasing unwieldiness, and the government's disinclination to return capital to citizens.

3024 2018-08-16 17:12:32 When I lived in Spain & Portugal as language student/teaching Eng, people suggested olive oil for hair; also wee tub  olive oil in fridge gt healer/protection for first months of breast feeding (does not need washed off). Weleda Calendula Lotion BEST after sun cream!
3025 2018-08-16 17:12:18 A Christian without the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a well without water, a cloud without rain, a tree without fruit, a lamp without oil.
3026 2018-08-16 17:11:59 Today I will relearn how to change my oil because fuck my parents telling me to go to pep boys

3028 2018-08-16 17:11:50 Condemning & Boycotting is not the solution. Developed countries citizen, please also have developed mentality and be rational. Palm oil too has many goodness just like any other vegetable oil.

3031 2018-08-16 17:11:14 A-nonsense.  B-I don’t take financial advice from someone who pretends investing in a giant wall is a good idea and will actually do it just to buy votes from those who don’t know better.  Trump doesn’t believe it’ll work and neither do you.  It’s snake oil and you all know it.
3032 2018-08-16 17:11:10 In 1971, Nissin introduced Cup Ramen + cheese sauce of the seasoning oil.
3033 2018-08-16 17:11:04 Oooopsie!
3034 2018-08-16 17:10:55 But you believe Trumps very credible source who has Obama's birth certificate? If you're really against fake news stop defending a proven liar. Otherwise just keep buying the snake oil like a sucker.
3035 2018-08-16 17:10:53 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
3036 2018-08-16 17:10:26 Invest in U.S. natural gas & oil! Gaster Exploration Inc. (GST) is at only .09 cents & will continue to go up. Buy American!

3038 2018-08-16 17:10:19 I believe sunscreen is much safer than tanning oil!

3041 2018-08-16 17:09:56 I fucking hate getting my oil changed
3042 2018-08-16 17:09:50 That’s the BBC licence fee right there! Best of luck and please let me know how it goes! Remember straws. And massage oil for your back. And hippy music. And your birth partner needs comfy shoes. X

3044 2018-08-16 17:09:30 @sanchitabhartiy Have received any gifts/vouchers from Indian oil? I waa also selected as the lucky winner but haven't received anything yet.
3045 2018-08-16 17:09:28 Tory Glastonbury? In the spirit of entrepreneurship, I bet they welcome all the con artists selling sage dipped in patchouli oil and little wraps of Persil.
3046 2018-08-16 17:09:27 They still do it where i live...check air pressure, oil level, wash my window and check the wiper blades....
3047 2018-08-16 17:09:24 Listen now, just don't forget later like politicians tend to do. 

Also, kick the oil lobbyists out ya dingbats
3048 2018-08-16 17:09:19 Good morning. Terrific THORsday to everyone except the fascists. The Pythagorean numerology today is a six. Don't fret the small stuff, the squeaky wheel gets the oil. Break a leg. Peace.
3049 2018-08-16 17:09:19 Bakit parang walang talab yung efficascent oil? 
3050 2018-08-16 17:09:15 R Adams was researching botanical medicines and had the patent held in the LOC. The patent goes through a process that takes time, but this seemed to take longer than most AND it just happens to conflict with Standard Oil's agenda of conquering capitalism...which they did.
3051 2018-08-16 17:09:12 Does oil get boiled in boiling water or does water get boiled in hot oil

3056 2018-08-16 17:07:59 There had better be oil on Mars 
3057 2018-08-16 17:07:57 well that sounds great..the sort of thing Rick Stein would do sampling the food along the journey.
3058 2018-08-16 17:07:55 Don’t confuse a lefty with the facts. 

Like oil and water, the two do t mix.
3059 2018-08-16 17:07:38 All four of the sectors described consume PRIMARY ENERGY SOURCE (coal, petroleum, oil, nuclear) but also uses most of the electricity produces as from a SECONDARY ENERGY SOURCE (being converted from a primary source)!
3060 2018-08-16 17:07:29 Do you ever run out of all your make up basics like oil, foundation, concealer,powder, mascara at the same time & it turns into an expensive trip to the make up store? 
3061 2018-08-16 17:07:11 Dark money, Westminster power grabs, lies/disinformation about oil whenever an election or referendum looms, lack of praise for ScotGov in MSM when things go well.
3062 2018-08-16 17:06:32 FALAFEL WRAP; homemade falafels( baked no oil), tzatziki, lemon tahini sauce, romaine and feta in whole wheat wrap w/ salad $10.00
3063 2018-08-16 17:06:31 By right the developed countries in the west supposedly assist the developing /under developed countries on the  protection. Palm Oil is an innovative creation and cheapest sources of cooking oil for people of the world especially for those in under developed countries to use.

3076 2018-08-16 17:04:58 What is NOT a coincidence is that the new Trump oil sanctions against #Iran will be coming to force on the 4th of November which is the anniversary of the US embassy takeover in 1979.
3077 2018-08-16 17:04:58 And I thought blood was thicker than olive oil
3078 2018-08-16 17:04:57 Does she have at least two years experience on Lloyd’s oil rig?
3079 2018-08-16 17:04:49 Already decided on cbd oil just trying to figure out the correct strength for me.
3080 2018-08-16 17:04:47 Monopolies are perfectly capable of tearing down themselves. See endless graveyard of "monopolies" like Microsoft, US Standard Oil, GE, etc, etc. The world is dynamic. Tech changes. Tastes change. A monopoly not protected by regulation is just great service.

3084 2018-08-16 17:03:58 Socialism is not a lifestyle and USSR/China made life much better for the people living there. Even venezuela got much better before it went to shit because it relied too much on oil. Socialism is a lifestyle meme is worn out and needs to die

3088 2018-08-16 17:03:12 -Do not blow away all your money, you're likely to hit lv20 fairly fast and you want it to upgrade your oil/coin production or upgrade ships. 
-avoid limit breaking all your ships immediately, +1 LB is good for a while. LBing all the time will increase the costs and drain you.
3089 2018-08-16 17:02:48 Just came back from drinking with one of business partner with one of biggest oil company worldwide based in USA, and he, like others like him, adored Trump for his pro American policies ie spending
3090 2018-08-16 17:02:44 A risk in unilaterally asking taxpayers to shut down their big oil sectors like California or Norway is it could create frustration when the effects are disappointing or perverse. Better to be sure we have the evidence first to do good policy rather than invite political blowback
3091 2018-08-16 17:02:42 In case anyone cares, the thing I use to light my BBQ charcoal or soak up garage oil that no one reads anymore launched a coordinated attack on the president who called them fake news and irrelevant.
3092 2018-08-16 17:02:34 At a recent Oireachtas Committee hearing on the Climate Emergency Bill, the @IEA presented their sustainable development scenario, in which they see “a need for continued investment in oil and gas projects to meet energy demand”

3094 2018-08-16 17:02:34 Hehehe. Even the naturally aspirated 4.2-litre oil unit in the J70 rumbles when you tease the gas pedal.
3095 2018-08-16 17:02:32 I just want to dip these kind of people into frying oil. I don't care if I'm going to hell.
3096 2018-08-16 17:02:32 Did you see C4 last night about Orang-utans? Amazing and yes palm oil farming is killing them. It’s in all kinds of products - soap, chocolates, cakes...
3097 2018-08-16 17:02:28 Smart move; that two-way conversation with God.
 

"to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness, that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that He might be glorified.”

I would tell a joke about oil...but it's a bit crude.
3100 2018-08-16 17:02:01 Queen Mother was a huge homeopath ditto POW.  King George VI got treatment for cancer very late as had been consulting a homeopath - bunch of charlatans & snake oil purveyors.
3101 2018-08-16 17:01:58 It is also on @JustinTrudeau at this point to shut Canada's end down. He won't (which shocks me, as liberal and environmental minded as he claims to be). I get it...you have a lot of oil in Alberta. You also have a lot of space for wind and solar farms.
3102 2018-08-16 17:01:57 I would like to ride my motorbike from the bottom of France through to Portugal via Spain. I thought a Motor home as an option . I once backpacked from Melbourne to Darwin  staying in youth Hostels but getting lazy.
3103 2018-08-16 17:01:55 YOU! It is YOU that has betrayed the American People!! You sold out our Country for greed, money, & oil.

3105 2018-08-16 17:01:43 i’m 10,000 miles overdue for an oil change so every time my car makes the slightest noise i get paranoid that it’ll blow up :-)
3106 2018-08-16 17:01:42 Aww poor thing sorry to hear that. Hope you have aloe for your burn. Hope you have peppermint oil for your headache.
3107 2018-08-16 17:01:36 Last call for questions for tonight! We’re joined by @jordan_worland, so if you have any queries about the best beard oil brands, now’s the time.
3108 2018-08-16 17:01:33 @Kena_Ewuru I owe you a 20ml bottle of beard oil.
3109 2018-08-16 17:01:21 How come when I wanna go on a road trip somewhere my car magically needs an oil change? And it cost $50

3113 2018-08-16 17:01:07 Nice! I doubled my bone broth, did vit c, apple cider vinegar, oil of oregano, and activated charcoal. Next is chicken soup!
3114 2018-08-16 17:01:02 Thanks for reading. Genuinely happy to talk to you in the future about your work to get an oil and gas perspective. For what it’s worth, I would gladly write about forest management in a story about “proximate causes.” That’s just not the focus of this piece.
3115 2018-08-16 17:00:59 As with normal tires they only need to be balanced once. Have them rotated at oil change intervals.
3116 2018-08-16 17:00:45 Thanks! Sounds good and easy. I presume you mean essential oil food grade cedarwood oil.
and what ratio of dilution would yu recommend?

One day they going to make a  miss print and til the truth.
3132 2018-08-16 16:59:25 tons of things:
-do not reroll
-don't blow your load of cubes on something except for particular banners
-don't max out all current gears you're finding
-don't blow your diamons on only clothes
-avoid auto for missions you haven't done yet
-don't waste your oil on food(for now)
3133 2018-08-16 16:59:17 Girl... basil, garlic, pine nuts & the best olive oil & solid Parmesan you can afford on your list if you are living your best life... bung it in food processor on to hot pasta & really say goodbye to the inferior (pricier) non olive oil, no taste shop versions!
3134 2018-08-16 16:58:59 I made the mistake of buying barbecue chips cooked in coconut oil. Don’t be like me.
3135 2018-08-16 16:58:58 Hey @jiffylube I don’t appreciate being told my 2015 Outback 3.6L requires synthetic oil when Subaru’s maintenance manual says conventional.
3136 2018-08-16 16:58:40 more than 630 year ! is it not enough for you ? lets show saudi, how long they stay...the next 30 years no more oil, and then ? fallout ! however ! U know better and the muslims worldiwde know what saudis are ! don't worry ! we all know it !
3137 2018-08-16 16:58:32 honestly ever since i ran out of my body shop which was literally 5 months ago I've been surviving with only olive oil
3138 2018-08-16 16:58:24 Preach
3139 2018-08-16 16:58:18 Algae Oil should be part of that green new deal. If all cars are not electric then we should replace fossil fuels with algae biofuel.
3140 2018-08-16 16:58:01 Real talk. Cuz ain’t nobody pouring out oil over Ms. Min-aj at the end of her career and life.
3141 2018-08-16 16:57:58 I oil my hair every other day & it’s like it knows when I get off track or skip a day
3142 2018-08-16 16:57:56 I even used an essential oil mix for post radiation treatment instead of the recommended pharmaceutical lotion. My doctor agreed to let me.  Results extremely good
3143 2018-08-16 16:57:49 The oil boom in my town has mostly died off. Rent is still high, and landlords are trying to chase off current (grandfathered in) renters to get someone else in for more money per month. I'd love to move, but I love my job too much. Closest town is 20min+ drive, plus only 1 car..
3144 2018-08-16 16:57:44 We had to grin and bear it for eight very long years.  Will never forget "ISIS is JV Team" as Obama was afraid of collateral damage as oil trucks funded ISIS; and #Benghazi Low points for America @KrisParonto
3145 2018-08-16 16:57:41 it belongs to the guy changing my oil today. he says he bought her for $800! can you believe?! I told him he’s a lucky guy indeed.
3146 2018-08-16 16:57:33 Oh keto connect on yt is a great resource * u * 
Keto is basically running on better fuel aka burning body fat instead of sugar
Sugars spike insulin and causes hormone imbalances in our body, mood & overall health
I get my healthy fats from: avocados, almonds, coconut oil, chia
3147 2018-08-16 16:57:29 "A man died early Wednesday after falling into a vat of oil and grease at a plant near Walt Disney World that recycles the resort’s food waste, authorities said."

Why the misleading picture?
3148 2018-08-16 16:57:23 MSNBC also runs plenty of ads from big pharma, which explains why hosts almost never criticize drug companies.

Same goes for big oil.  Even Chris Hayes has really backed off from covering climate change.
3149 2018-08-16 16:57:06 I have those Neutrogena oil facial slips that take oil off your face and my god the whole sheet be shiny after wiping this face down
3150 2018-08-16 16:57:03 Got an oil change today and they returned my car with two coupons for a car wash. Are they trying to say something or just be nice..? Either way my dirty car and I will take it
3151 2018-08-16 16:56:49 ふええ
3152 2018-08-16 16:56:38 Changing the oil in my car doesn't make me a mechanic.

3154 2018-08-16 16:56:28 I take Topamax now and it has helped.  But these months of high humidity are just killing me.  I think I am going to try CBD oil (since I live in Ohio where we aren't dispensing yet).
3155 2018-08-16 16:56:20 That'll be why the Welsh Assembly banned unconventional oil and gas extraction, Elaine. Welsh govt. Its criminal for an English development to utilise water from Wales, particularly as your nation has banned the technology.
3156 2018-08-16 16:56:20 めいちゃんどこですか？
3157 2018-08-16 16:56:18 Sounds like you’re well placed to know the score re how it is in oil sector. I worked on fringes and didn’t recognise the version churned out by media either at the one or now. It’d great if some (say) BBC analysis was done of Oil Fund we never had. Or maybe by a Uni dept?

3159 2018-08-16 16:56:04 I'll give their website a look, sounds interesting. I never saw the documentary unfortunately, I didn't know one was on. It's a shame as I love orangutans as well. My son has a 'green' Blue Peter badge for doing a project on how the palm oil industry is killing orangutans.
3160 2018-08-16 16:56:03 Says the old mad loser from Uganda! Africa can never develop when a single person rules a country to his old age death! You are a shame to the whole of Africa!

3163 2018-08-16 16:55:57 i was reading about carbon reclamation for the atmosphere and they talked about then burying it back into depleted oil reserves. i thought "surely there is something they could do with that...."
3164 2018-08-16 16:55:53 Well you could use 3 in 1, but it makes more mess. You don't need much oil. It's just there to help reduce friction, and help prevent rust. The key is to get an oil that will cling, but not too thick so it sticks on all the dirt and makes it into a grinding paste
3165 2018-08-16 16:55:52 agreed! but how long can oil PSUs sustain if we bring back subsidy burden? We need to get rid of subsidy and then only will development follow
3166 2018-08-16 16:55:25 Oil...ehlisa
3167 2018-08-16 16:55:20 @DNC DO NOT take money from gas and oil. You know I was a lifelong Democrat - I quit the party after 2016 primary in New Mexico. Corrupt. Want to dismantle the DISGUSTING Republicans do NOT replicate their corruption. Come on - have a new path.

3170 2018-08-16 16:55:06 I'm allergic to bees so I'm not too thrilled about the huge ass nest they put in my front end. Looks like I'm not doing my oil change.
3171 2018-08-16 16:54:57 I am all for cannabis oil for treatment of cancer patients & seizures. But there are safe oils & toxic ones. Please read our post today. It will astound you.
3172 2018-08-16 16:54:56 I have a love/hate relationship for coconut oil hair treatments
3173 2018-08-16 16:54:43 Alex Jones is a hypocrite. I’m old enough to remember when he made legitimate criticisms of foreign policy and over policing. Now, he’s just proven himself to be an insane greedy whore for Donald Trump. He has no morals. He sells snake oil to MAGA CHUDs.
3174 2018-08-16 16:54:35 In a similar way, Standard oil had a monopoly on the us market before being broken. I think of its successors as monopistic bc, while they do not single handedly control the us market, each of them is large enough to significantly influence price, supply, etc and they cooperate
3175 2018-08-16 16:54:20 Μετά 2 βδομάδες ήρθε στο φως το περιστατικό βανδαλισμού της 28ης Ιουλίου από δυο 50χρόνες που μπηκαν στο Βυζαντινό Μουσείο προκαλωντας ανεξίτηλες φθορές στα εκθέματα, επί μιάμιση ώρα ράντιζωντας εικόνες, επιγραφές, ψηφιδωτά, τοίχους κ.α. με baby oil & κανείς..δεν τις αντιλήφθηκε!

3177 2018-08-16 16:53:16 Sala resign dene k bad bhi oil ka istemal ho rha.
3178 2018-08-16 16:53:13 Also the future challenge will be how to keep *a lot* of fossil fuels in the ground- two thirds by some counts. This will imply a even flatter supply curve in future. The challenge therefore will be less about the market p of oil and more cheaper alternatives and carbon prices
3179 2018-08-16 16:52:59 In the summer my face produces so much oil it’s sickening. Like during the day & at night I wake up with so much oil on my face it’s disgusting!
3180 2018-08-16 16:52:56 Reuters energy analyst John Kemp: "Hedge fund managers have cut their bullish positioning in U.S. heating #oil by 29 million barrels (33 percent) and in European gasoil by 53 million barrels (33 percent) since late May." #commodities #energysector

3184 2018-08-16 16:52:29 a furry snake oil salesman selling liquid validation
3185 2018-08-16 16:52:29 I wish you made more flavors without coconut oil as an ingredient.  I’m allergic to coconut oil.
3186 2018-08-16 16:52:08 Uncertainty is not the same as no effect.  By same token, leakage from unilateral demand cutbacks could simply leave more oil barrels for developing Asia or Africa to consume.  Only way to keep that from happening is to also cut supply.
3187 2018-08-16 16:51:58 good morning tea tree oil thank u for getting me through my darkest times <3 luv u baby
3188 2018-08-16 16:51:56 Oh my gods...

3196 2018-08-16 16:51:12 Wow. You look gorgeous! But be aware, I cut my hair last year, it took me all summer for my hair to get a good balance of the oil your hair produces
3197 2018-08-16 16:51:11 Gynecologists really supposed to get up that pussy like how you change oil. But they lazy that why y’all lil cootie cats be hurting from that pap clamp

3205 2018-08-16 16:50:22 The big question is how flexible the supply curve is over the long run. Historical evidence suggests pretty flexible - 2 barrels discovered for every one consumed, real oil prices haven’t risen much despite massive growth in demand
3206 2018-08-16 16:50:12 Juniper oil 
3207 2018-08-16 16:49:41 Is olive oil zytoon teal?

3210 2018-08-16 16:49:36 Should continue tariff on China and also increase the rate for USA oil export and increase burden on Iraq, Iran and Turkey for the saw.  It results increase the export, foreign reserbe

3216 2018-08-16 16:48:46 Mm that sounds delicious.

Rock shrimp, sesame oil, ginger, probably roast garlic instead of raw, cilantro, pork. Oh! I add shiitakes.
3217 2018-08-16 16:48:39 I tried the peppermint oil before and it burned me, so it m sensitive to oils. I have no idea what to try. Besides crying, and I can’t do too much of that.
3218 2018-08-16 16:48:37 He is no Robinhood he is a used car salesman with snake oil and he is a great salesperson to the disenfranchised.

3222 2018-08-16 16:47:48 Where did you get that 'plastic reduces co2 emissions'? Id be interested! All I could find is that plastic production is responsible for 9% of oil related GHGE. Even if you count its energy efficiency benefits.
3223 2018-08-16 16:47:43 Then tightening PSU is the solution and not discarding PSUs. Just look at how successful oil PSUs are. It takes will, country has a big heart and far more skills!/
3224 2018-08-16 16:47:43 "Whoever loves pleasure will become poor; whoever loves wine and olive oil will never be rich." (Prov 21:17) - My wife regularly chastises me for my generous use of olive oil. She's so biblical that way.
3225 2018-08-16 16:47:43 Ummm ok! I’m obsessed with Avocado oil
3226 2018-08-16 16:47:33 No hemp oil on the list?
3227 2018-08-16 16:47:31 The patent for CBD extraction was started 5 years earlier. Prohibition and criminalization wiped out Standard Oil's only competition - plant based biofuels that can be made at home. Standard oil also funded the Flexner Report and Flexner was a med school drop hired by Rockefeller
3228 2018-08-16 16:46:51 Imagine only if you cared for these kids future. Hopefully you’re saving all that money from oil and gas for your kids. Wouldn’t want them to be susceptible to the economic collapse that’s coming from climate change. I hope for their sake its a lot. Selling out shouldn’t be cheap
3229 2018-08-16 16:46:50 I’m so sorry to hear that. Magnesium tablets, magnesium oil, and Epsom salt baths laced with patchouli oil. Salts cheapest from no-name chemists, the rest on bogoff at Holland & Barrett.
Also Citalopram.
3230 2018-08-16 16:46:48 So I’m getting my oil changed & I said sorry to the guy about something. He says “Dont be sorry. Never tell a man you’re sorry. That’s rule.”

I like that. 
3231 2018-08-16 16:46:45 Looks like power steering oil.
3232 2018-08-16 16:46:41 Democrats caused the great recession by easing requirements for obtaining home mortgages and allowing predatory loans back in the Clinton Administration, and allowing OPEC to ream out America with preposterous oil prices..... learn your history!
3233 2018-08-16 16:46:40 What's this f*ing fixation over Tesla? You don't have other stocks to short? Maybe other good short recommendations in the energy/oil sector?   Sick and tired of the same trade.
3234 2018-08-16 16:46:40 During Atal ji's time, India saw an Earthquake, 2 Cyclones, worst Drought in 30 years, Oil crisis, Kargil, USA sanctions, Yet GDP didn't falter in his time. Today we lost one of the best PMs of India, Bhishma Pitamah of Politics.

3246 2018-08-16 16:44:56 Yes but a cbd vape works better because it breaks the blood brain barrier giving you more immediate relief best results is take cbd oil orally daily to help prevent and use a cbd vape if you do end up getting a panic attack

3276 2018-08-16 16:43:13 Yes Howson did one in pastel on paper and one in oil. Seemingly his oil did 40 grand in a charity auction and he donated the pastel to the Sunday Mail. The vendor won it in their competition and has decided to put it up for auction.
3277 2018-08-16 16:43:09 @ea_amrita does have some analysis for demand destruction for an oil price rise beyond $80. Something like demand growth goes down by x % for every $ y rise in price beyond $80. I can't remember the exact numbers.
3278 2018-08-16 16:43:07 I have to go take my car in to get it’s oil changed and you know sure as hell thats the last thing I want to do right now.
3279 2018-08-16 16:42:54 Are you guys not concerned that Saudi Arabia is going to control a significant portion of Tesla? The reason I purchased a Model 3 was in part to move away from big oil. Saudi Arabia is THE definition of big oil...
3280 2018-08-16 16:42:50 Where in your comparisons are the shipping costs to Canadian refineries for the Brent price supplied light oil? 

Also you s/b referring to the recent partial upgrader report in your heavy oil comparison. $9+$9 CDN still better than $30 USD current differential!

EE is viable!
3281 2018-08-16 16:42:49 Follow the money

Russia's main export is oil and NG which makes it SA's main rival throughout EU

SA is trying to use the U.S. to fight a proxy war against their main economic rival; Russia (through sanctions)

OPEC $$ / SA is the biggest threat to U.S. National Security

3284 2018-08-16 16:42:26 If you try sweets from Europe n shit, yeah it could make you store a little extra weight, but it’ll go away in a day because our bodies can actually use sugar and butter and plant oil. Our bodies can’t use preservatives though, or dyes, or corn syrup
3285 2018-08-16 16:42:08 Was there South African olive oil?  Does @TheSavannaShop stock South African olive oil?
3286 2018-08-16 16:42:07 I slice them, drizzle with olive oil, lightly salt & pepper, oven roast at 420º for 20 minutes. Remove and drizzle with a dressing of 1 part balsamic vinegar & 1 part real maple syrup. My family begs for them!
3287 2018-08-16 16:41:59 As much as I like trump giving Saudis more weapons was a bad move. Yet if he doesn’t they will sell oil in something other then dollars so bit of a predicament.

3381 2018-08-16 16:32:42 It is a matter of time before the oil market tightens again and we make new highs. Depletion, non-Opec disappointing, Venezuela, Iran sanctions, demand growing every year (a bit slower will not change much). Oil will eventually go back up.

3430 2018-08-16 16:27:08 If my car needs an oil change, then change my oil. If my car needs to be fixed then take my car to get fixed or fix the shit.

3432 2018-08-16 16:26:11 Atal also never allowed GDP rate to falter despite sanctions, oil crisis, Kargil war and western hostilities. In comparison MMS had it smooth. But yes both statesmen are different and don't insult their contributions by comparisons.

3439 2018-08-16 16:25:23 Lol. K. USA has enough to sustain itself now and ship it to Europe. Canada has enough gas and oil to sustain itself. Wait for it!! SA sees that and investing in green energy. Smart! Russia will under cut your prices to survive. I follow Energy Markets for decades.

3442 2018-08-16 16:24:45 @BP_plc f*** you British Petroleum as everybody else tries lto lower the price of a barrel of oil and you keep raising yours.. Don't think we won't take your platforms out or family members get your f****** s*** together the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few..AFF

3444 2018-08-16 16:24:16 Some people are just like oil and water together.
3445 2018-08-16 16:24:13 Please when did he fight for people legit coz all he fought for are rich pocket companies... Banks and oil companies
3446 2018-08-16 16:24:09 Phew! Car lives to fight another day. Turns out we got it to garage just in time. Don't ignore oil warning lights.  Even if it only lights up the once!
3447 2018-08-16 16:23:58 Probably should have cleaned my car before I took it for an oil change  sorry people
3448 2018-08-16 16:23:54 and some of the esential oil stuff can be pretty dangerous too! like you shouldn't put undiluted essential oils of any sort on your skin but even some diluted ones are just too much of an irritant (cinnamon for example)
3449 2018-08-16 16:23:33 I use rosehip oil from Botanics. It's 100% organic.
3450 2018-08-16 16:23:28 When is it going on the website?
3451 2018-08-16 16:23:25 Homelessness, the destruction of the NHS, a decent living wage, care for our elderly, selling arms to warmongers, wars for oil, zero hours contracts, crooked banksters are all far more important than your euro fixation.
3452 2018-08-16 16:23:25 Different @NickColeman19 I'm afraid. I have never written a word about oil, let alone gas.
3453 2018-08-16 16:23:15 thank you! i love anointing people w oil. 
3454 2018-08-16 16:23:12 I need some men on Texas Southern Campus to try out this beard oil when it drops...
3455 2018-08-16 16:22:57 Lower oil prices...well, EU will jump right on that. It's probably gross how they can suck up to the Mullahs, then enjoy some savings while they're at it.
3456 2018-08-16 16:22:47 Spray a cup with the non stick spray (I use olive oil spray) and scramble the eggs in the cup!! Be sure and break the yolk or it will destroy your microwave!!

3458 2018-08-16 16:22:25 To be fair, Rockefeller's wealth came from oil (gas and kerosene), and monopoly control of the US. Hardly "striking new paths" as far as millionarie/billionaires go. 
3459 2018-08-16 16:22:20 Investment in greenetech is overtaking fossil fuels. It's not about loving oil it's about seeing the future. Maybe pull your head out from between your cheeks.
3460 2018-08-16 16:22:17 You need to realize that if we export LNG and China stops burning coal it's better for the environment but your to narrow minded to see these things and think that pollution stops at the border of countries Or stopping all oil is the  answer even though everything has oil in it
3461 2018-08-16 16:22:12 Currently googling “remove oil from linen”

3484 2018-08-16 16:18:52 @PlantTherapy customer rep recommended me an oil. I said I was unsure if I'd like it. they said if I don't I can get a replacement. I didn't like it. But guess what? THEY STOOD BY THEIR WORD! Can't wait to try honeybell! Anyone else try it yet?!

3492 2018-08-16 16:17:53 Currently diffusing cinnamon, balsam fir, orange, and eucalyptus oil and pretending its September already
3493 2018-08-16 16:17:51 Yes yes yes! I mix lavender and peppermint with a little bit of coconut oil and rub it all over my body! The mosquitoes love me too.
3494 2018-08-16 16:17:49 Or a victory for Saudi Arabia & tanker transport of oil, oil transport by train - increasing risk & carbon footprint.  #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
3495 2018-08-16 16:17:40 I’d discovered folding bikes, a person could get from oil and there is enough for the bicycle in city centres.
3496 2018-08-16 16:17:13 I rented from @SixtUSA. Car was leaking oil so I called to have a replacement sent to me. I was told by a customer rep that I must have caused the oil leak and i would be charged for the “damage.” If you like being treated like a criminal, rent from @SixtUSA
3497 2018-08-16 16:17:12 India & Turkey are both big importers of #Iran #oil. their currency depreciations are not good for US #IranSanctions. Both will be more likely to import more cheap Iranian oil as a result. #OOTT
3498 2018-08-16 16:17:10 Laypeople with no knowledge of energy or geology were talking about peak oil supply in the 2000s. Energy sector experts today now talk about peak oil *demand* approaching, thanks to climate change and cheaper renewable energy.
3499 2018-08-16 16:17:04 (I have little experience) (but I'm working on it) - using CBD oil after 2 knee replacements.  CBD made from hemp with no THC is available on the internet and (maybe) health food stores where you are.  Totally legal. (Not that you might not want some THC - but it's a start.)
3500 2018-08-16 16:16:32 Yeah, fucking OIL
3501 2018-08-16 16:16:31 I love oil rigs at reasonable depths. Oil rigs represent lower energy costs, more jobs and tax revenue. What’s not to like about oil rigs?

3511 2018-08-16 16:15:50 I've been taking edibles and CBD oil for ongoing back issues (military related) and I'm virtually pain free now. Other than having to take the occasional ibuprofen. 
I did have a set back in June when I was in the gym and slipped a disc. But that was due to thinking I'm still 20
3512 2018-08-16 16:15:31  how much oil did they need to put in ?

3515 2018-08-16 16:15:14 The effects of the current trade wars, softening of global demand and the rally in the $ index maybe? Surprised oil hasn't followed gold..

3517 2018-08-16 16:15:06 Not surprised!  More Drilling in Alaska has always been part of their plan. More land distroyed, more polution, and Republicans & oil companies love it.

3521 2018-08-16 16:14:51 The bunkum is too far from reality. By 2030 and 2040 or so, France and India will have majority of their cars running on battery (electric cars).

3535 2018-08-16 16:13:44 Agreed but you do realize that being that many who worked in the oil field business ( and this includes jobs that trickle down from this) have been hugely affected! We need that business booming again to help Alberta and its residents. Talk is cheap we need action!
3536 2018-08-16 16:13:42 Maybe but it does not make it correct analysis or correct interpretation. 

This type of basic analysis is like the arguement between evolutionism and Creationism on why the oil got there in the first place. One is right the other is simply poor interpretation.
3537 2018-08-16 16:13:39 I’m already knowin. Frying chicken is a different process tho. I tried it but it’s a whole different process than frying it in oil.
3538 2018-08-16 16:13:30 No, regarding vaccines, Pharma is like the mechanic who changes your oil with metal-shaving-adulterated oil when you pay for an oil-change, then charges you to repair your car when the metal shavings ruin it....
3539 2018-08-16 16:13:17 Have you ever asked him why between April 2014 and August 2014 his version of how much oil there was dropped by 25%?
Where did all that oil go? If his figures vary that much why would you ever again ask his view on anything?
3540 2018-08-16 16:13:13 I use oils all the time, mostly for nausea and migraines, but sometimes for a lift of spirits. I have an oil pendant necklace I can wear if I'm going out and I'm worried about car sickness/ cigarette smoke. A few drops lasts for hours. I also use them in baths. It helps my skin.

3546 2018-08-16 16:12:09 Sear covers are also really good to soak up the oil on your face. Also, gift tissue paper.

3548 2018-08-16 16:11:40 They could drill on the beach if that's where the oil was.  You need to get out of the Senate Bill.  You have been there toooooooooo loooooooonnnngggg.  You are the poster child for #TermLimits  I'm voting for @ScottforFlorida

3557 2018-08-16 16:10:24 Again, no. The individual who talked about cure & to whom I was addressing my comments before before you jumped in DM'd me & we have had an excellent discussion (he/she is way more educated about cannabis oil than you). You have merely been an annoyance.

'Cause there's PEOPLE here and the last time people were here, they were all "OOO" and touched things and now I have oil paint smudged on my ipad stand and TV remote for some reason.
3561 2018-08-16 16:10:09 boo hoo oil companies.
3562 2018-08-16 16:10:08 Endless oil story
3563 2018-08-16 16:10:02 I noticed they have buses that run off bio fuel. I'm guessing it's the oil waste collection vat for that.
3564 2018-08-16 16:09:44 ESSENTIAL OIL MOMS
3565 2018-08-16 16:09:38 Anxiety while getting an oil change
3566 2018-08-16 16:09:34 รำคาญก็อันฟอลอ่ะ ไม่ต้องไปแซะเขา ประสาท เขาก็ทวิตในส่วนของเขา มึงตามเขาเอง บ้าบอ
3567 2018-08-16 16:09:31 IMHO they are all connected. Our planet is a living organism. Oil we burn in the USA is causing a drought in Africa. We have to accept there are consequences to our actions and take responsibility, work for change/better ways. Everyone of us is using resources/creating waste.
3568 2018-08-16 16:09:29 *looking in mirror* damn this face is drier and got more oil than the arabian peninsula

my face: OIL OIL OIL OILYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
3573 2018-08-16 16:09:14 why is it such a crazy idea that maybe my service appointment might take longer if i ask them to check something else beside do an oil change, like there’s absolutely ZERO reason to be pissed with me when i ask for a ride instead of waiting almost 3 hours at honda 
3574 2018-08-16 16:09:13 I repeat your great leader called Hugo Chavez’s Venezuela adventure a “Socialist Revolution” which he urged Madura to continue...which he did. The government runs a whole plethora of companies including oil which was nationalised with a whole raft of other industries!
3575 2018-08-16 16:09:11 Coinzy, a 70% success rate on wall st. Is good.  Only 5% of hedge funds and fund managers beat the s&p.  You also cant judge on a 1 year performance.  T Boone Pickens was a rockstar for 3 years during oil boom, the rest of his career has been ehhhh  but that 3 yrs = billions
3576 2018-08-16 16:09:11 If Iranian government is to be changed, it has to be the will and effort by the people, not the US government and it's "allies". US sanctions and ban on the sale of Iranian oil is what is truly ripping Iran's economy apart. Remember that. As terrible as Iran's current government
3577 2018-08-16 16:08:57 Some great spots you have visited , I am planning a trade and travel trip for 6 months the idea is of course to try to finance the trip by making some cash on the move .
3578 2018-08-16 16:08:32 kalo double cleansing tuh cuman bersihin wajah pake 2 produk aja, kaya micellar water terus langsung facial wash. Kalo tripple pake 3 produk, kaya cleansing oil/milk cleanser, terus micellar water, dan terakhir facial wash . Gitu é

3580 2018-08-16 16:08:16 If you cannot get at the lubrication system or filter directly, you may be able to lessen the effectiveness of oil by diluting it in storage.
3581 2018-08-16 16:08:09 As if this is DUBAI where OIL is cheaper than water!!

As #AFRICANS we have ourselves to blame when we talk of poverty.

We want to SKYDIVE before we can learn to JUMP or even WALK!
3582 2018-08-16 16:08:02 Who owns them is immaterial - it's who controls the mineral rights & issues the licenses that calls the shots.
That would be Scotland.
It would also be Scotland who levels the tax on all that oil.
This would contribute to the needs of 5m Scots, not 60m Brits.
Penny dropped yet?
3583 2018-08-16 16:07:58 and drink peppermint tea instead. I have something called “white flower oil” (you can get it on Amazon and at some Asian groceries) and put three drops in my shampoo but that only works if you’re able to shower. Tiger balm (the white kind, not the red) on temples and.../2

Hadith No: 8From: Sahih Bukhari. Chapter 13, Friday PrayerNarrated/Authority of Salman Al-Farsi The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, "Whoever takes a bath on Friday, purifies himself as much as he can, then uses his (hair) oil or perfumes himself with the scent of his house

3587 2018-08-16 16:07:37 Just found the perfect way to cook brussel sprouts. Pre-boil, drain and fry in a little olive oil with chopped bacon & chopped onion. Then remove sprouts, throw them away and serve the bacon and onion...

3591 2018-08-16 16:07:06 When US was the biggest market for crude oil, they imposed sanctions on Iraq and Iran - even though it led to higher crude oil prices. China accounts for 66% of soybean consumption - and they are in a similar position. Now just like Iran & Iraq suffered, US farmers will suffer.

3593 2018-08-16 16:07:04 No. The important thing is to properly brown the meat and to add finely diced chicken livers. Lots of oregano. Cook for ages. Tinned tomatoes, beef stock and red wine, onion, garlic, olive oil. I sometimes make it with beef short rib.

3598 2018-08-16 16:06:24 Trump, PUtin and friends are partners in an international criminal enterprise to acquire as much assets no matter what it takes and who it hurts. They will use USA assets, military, land or oil, they don't fahking care about anything but power/money
3599 2018-08-16 16:06:09 Truth securing contracts supply aircraft is all nonsense. Britain installed the Saudi’s in to Arabia, we might as well of had all the oil wealth and not have supplied one single aircraft ...Britain would of been far wealthier for years for not buying our own oil from the Saudi’s
3600 2018-08-16 16:06:05 Yes...that’s coming. Here they also testning trucks with wires above....like truck trains. Biggest impact will be maritime transport. To short time to build refineries for v low sulphur bunker oil....so diesel will be the only option....for now.
3601 2018-08-16 16:06:02 Rose essential oil: because rose petals are not very high in oil content, it takes several thousand pounds of rose petals to produce just one ounce of this valuable oil, depending on the variety of plant. #essentialoils #healthylifestyle #healthyliving #youngliving #SeedToSeal
3602 2018-08-16 16:05:57 Malaysia has condensed milk now? I thought it was sweetened creamer made from Palm oil primarily.

3604 2018-08-16 16:05:52 Oh no! Ondansetron or Mirtazapine have helped. Low dose naltrexone has helped even more. I rarely get episodes of it all over since I got up to 2mg of LDN.

3624 2018-08-16 16:03:25 If you’ve never made mayonnaise, there’s only one trick to it: add to the oil literally drop by drop at the beginning, then by scant teaspoons, accelerating only toward the end. Otherwise it will break on you.

3629 2018-08-16 16:03:21 Im less certain of the food additives consumed over a lifetime. Not only direct physical effect but also psychological. Its hard to empirically quantify the possible damage.

3645 2018-08-16 16:01:11 That ought to work; it’s fairly standard except for the garlic. The absolutely standard recipe is all olive oil, and no garlic. But the mustard and the vinegar (or lemon juice) do belong there.

3655 2018-08-16 15:59:43 @HondaCustSvc brutal service. Now the manager is changing the story from faulty air filter to, we need to check the oil. To do that we have to take the mower apart. Changes stories as often as Trump. What a run around. 10 days to simply look, another week for run around. Sad.
3656 2018-08-16 15:59:35 “You’re car smells like gas, we had to turn away someone for an oil change cause their car smelled like gas.”

I don’t care if you don’t like it I just need the tire. Shit I’d fucking do it myself if you’d just sell me the tire.
3657 2018-08-16 15:59:23 A situation we rarely see, and are definitely not seeing now. Yet the fed is raising interest rates anyway. The last time we saw anything like that, OPEC was manipulating the price of oil, which figured into every price because, well, it's oil.
3658 2018-08-16 15:59:20 Ma'am, with all due respect, America has also caused a lot of death and destruction worldwide. Your previous government planned 9-11, murdered it's own people in order to invade Iraq for their rich deposit of oil. Donald Trump is our only hope to make that county great for once..
3659 2018-08-16 15:59:06 Can we also report excessive oil discharge from a vehicle that’s parked in front of my house ! Vehicle is never moved except street sweeper days and has discharged oil a good ten feet. Owner parks it a foot forward every time he moves for street sweeper.
3660 2018-08-16 15:59:06 If it makes you feel better I almost drank oil bc I thought it was my drink, I almost went to work in slippers, I almost left the milk in the pantry and my phone in the fridge lmao
3661 2018-08-16 15:59:04 Could it be that our dollar is feeling the result of big oil pressure against our policies banning further oil exploration

3673 2018-08-16 15:58:16 Using butter, olive oil, or coconut oil to coat the dish you are cooking the eggs in will help. Then, when you are finished, put your dishes in the sink immediately and soak them for a short while before washing them.

3693 2018-08-16 15:55:07 Been dual fuel engines for decades Ron,usually diesels that can run on gas ( usually propane or methane ) or diesel ( some can even run on the Heavy Fuel oil as well ) they are cleaner burning engines and need less maintenance but do cost almost double the price of normal engines
3694 2018-08-16 15:55:04 Yep that blocked bowel photo look of CIA Muffin @JohnBrennan after losing his security clearance. The good news John is Russian Caster Oil is 29% cheaper than most brands.

3697 2018-08-16 15:54:44 Si van solo a pintar o dar una mano d gato como se dicen mejor no hagamos el ridículo y no organicemos la copa América
3698 2018-08-16 15:54:12 I applaud the actions taken by ordinary folks that have tried to stop this catastrophic and lasting chaos.  The hypocrisy of our governments to use Oil as an easy way to create $  won't change. Could have, would have,  should have.  Is no excuse for future generations.
3699 2018-08-16 15:54:08 @motiontwin So far my favorite combo of weapons is probably Oil Sword and the Ice Shard. The slow effect+crit from Oil leads me to super speedy kills.
3700 2018-08-16 15:54:06 Bean salad for all then: parsil, tuna, onion, all minced, add beans, olive oil and salt.

3706 2018-08-16 15:53:13 At the @nodakchamber #NDSummit, Rep. Koppelman says oil extraction $$ is “not the people’s money”, suggesting revenue from private land by private corps, per state law, is not to be used outside those areas. Wonder if he’s supporting majority leaders’ infrastructure proposal?
3707 2018-08-16 15:53:10 2nd - the environmental laws we have now, exist because people can't always be trusted to think of anyone other than themselves. 

Go ahead and fight for the freedom to dump oil down the drain, or sewage/chemicals into a river, or throw trash out your window, cuz merica !
3708 2018-08-16 15:53:00 So what?, G. Bush killed thousands of Americans on he’s inside job on 9/11 and all because the greedy Middle East oil , Obama’s fabricate “ School shooting “ like sandy hoax to gain popularity, D. Trump it’s leaving  everywhere’s and so on , so what’s the point here ?.

3713 2018-08-16 15:52:31 And produced water is much more serious than an oil spill. When we got companies like Nexen, that dog breed, and those cheapskates nobody really likes continually having spills, LTIs and doghousing incidents, it hurts us all and makes the entire industry look bad.
3714 2018-08-16 15:52:30 Norway has vastly bigger Oil & Gas revenues than Scotland, there can be no comparsion however when it comes to defence much of NATO 75% is paid by the USA. Norway pays 1.4% GDP towards defence. Should be 2%  Scotland would never be in a position to provide that level of spending

3721 2018-08-16 15:51:10 In fact, in 73 after the October war between Is and Egypt again SA quadrupled the price of oil for the US because we aided Israel. This caused the stagflation of the 70s and really let the US know that we had to play by the Saudi's rules. They control our foreign policy. (2/2)
3722 2018-08-16 15:51:02 I’m for having signs for oil companies of all authoritarian regimes

3739 2018-08-16 15:48:01 While I haven’t tried this particular metal filter, we’ve tried others with the Chemex. They’re alright, but I’ve found it impacts the taste. First, there’s going to be a slight metallic flavor present. Second, the oil composition in the coffee is going to be different.

3749 2018-08-16 15:46:33 Just swish some spit around in there - or the duck egg juices - and it'll charge faster 

Or maybe fish sauce. Or medicated oil. That stuff works for everything around here!

3773 2018-08-16 15:43:40 Crude oil wkly stock change = field production + net imports - refinery intakes. Prod doesn't change much on wkly or monthly basis. Net imports vary by a factor of ~10 > refinery intakes therefore, net imports = main variable in crude oil stock change. Products come from crude...

3779 2018-08-16 15:42:55 Even if government has contributed, they're still classified as private. Otherwise you'd have to consider most charter schools, oil platforms, agriculture, and many other businesses as government owned instead of private.
3780 2018-08-16 15:42:48 But this is me when I go to get a oil change and they trynna play me and tell me I need to fix a bunch of shit and I’m like bro “my uncles a mechanic I just want a oil change”

3784 2018-08-16 15:42:25 We signed a currency swap deal with the Chinese, but our main export CRUDE OIL accounted for 82% ($500m) earnings with China in 2017. Where are we going to earn enough Yuan to reduce the $ pressure to the Naira?

We also had a $5b trade deficit in 2017

I am not understanding ooh

3799 2018-08-16 15:41:11 Once you realise that Israel is a staging post for the West for keeping the oil dollar in wars , then you realize why its never condemned.

Now double that thinking as a customer for weapons sales to enslave and commit genocide and add Saudi to the same model.

3811 2018-08-16 15:39:59 More scare tactics. Reading this Scotland should file bankruptcy and give away the rights to NS oil.  Beats me why Westminster altered margins of oil fields to place them under their ownership, when its worthless.

3818 2018-08-16 15:39:22 WIth crops like corn - yields are unknown and if the seed is planted, you're not going to stop growing this seasons crop.  With things like oil and nat gas - producers are good about shutting in wells with a very short time if prices get below the 'marginal cost of production'.

3834 2018-08-16 15:35:48 If we don't get our oil to market to supply the world's demand, it doesn't magically go away. All that does is takes money out of our country and gives it to far worse suppliers like Iran, Saudi, Russia, and Venezuela that don't care about human rights, let alone the environment

3866 2018-08-16 15:31:35 So true, thats why Uhuru aint messing around now. The IMF owns Kenya now, we are now being taxed more on the little income we generate as well as an increase in oil prices will shoot most if not all prices higher. Tuhame Kenya bro. Na watu bado wataiba.

3876 2018-08-16 15:30:57 800 cals from oil/butter, i dont think its a problem if its spread out and always combined with whole foods. I think it should just not be weaseled around that keto rests on oils or masses of avocado/olives. Which may not be a problem but can be a practical hurdle.

3967 2018-08-16 15:19:58 Seems like all the perfume oil sellers are in Lagos. Maybe I should take it up in Abuja. So that we can at least avoid that extra delivery cost.
3968 2018-08-16 15:19:42 Total cut-off of Iranian exports would lead to a price spike to 
above $120 a barrel? 

U.S. might be able to take around 500,000 bpd of Iran’s oil from the market.

1 million bpd as the more realistic assessment, up from initial estimates of some 500,000 bpd.
3969 2018-08-16 15:19:35 Cars are too expensive. Went in for a 100 dollar oil change and tune up. Ending up with upwards of 400 dollars of stuff to be done. LOVE IT.

3973 2018-08-16 15:19:16 Look at the oil prices from 1999 to 2007 and don't forget the Nigeria is Brent light which is slightly more expensive.
3974 2018-08-16 15:19:05 Shingles are no joke! Boost that immune system with rest and lots of fluids, and if you like natural options, oil of oregano, elderberry extract (juice or pill), and olive leaf are good natural supplements that are anti-viral. Hope you are feeling better!

Do not raise oil without dignity
3977 2018-08-16 15:18:36 One very strong reason why Nigeria may not leave it's current state is that, people are HUNGRY! Tom comes with quarter bag of rice, they hit the streets; Dick comes with Cooking Oil, they're waiting for him at airport; Harry gives them Gerri, they're chanting his name.
3978 2018-08-16 15:18:29 IMO the American automotive industry was the best. 
No boundaries design, big wide roads, plenty of oil meant the canvas was blank.

3983 2018-08-16 15:17:40 I thought getting my oil changed today was going to be horrible but the price is right is on in the waiting room and a guy from Cleveland just won a car so it’s going well
3984 2018-08-16 15:17:30 The loss of 2 million bpd of Iranian oil is the assumption in the hedge fund’s bet on $150 oil in a year or two. Iran’s oil exports peaked in April this year at 2.7 million bpd, and have been dropping every month since then.
3985 2018-08-16 15:17:03 Al Queda followed us into Iraq you quizling. We went there for regime change and oil procurement in a direct contradiction of our interests. Sadam was an effective enemy of AQ
3986 2018-08-16 15:16:50 Oil going from $75 to $150 over the next 12 to 18 months,
out-of-the-money oil options, further down the curve look very exciting. 
The pay back there is just going to be fantastic.
Largest % gains in 20-25 Years are now on the table.
3987 2018-08-16 15:16:33 If you're informed, you're surely aware that there are scientists & a host of other experts who either deny the evidence for climate change, or minimize the impacts for political reasons. Some have claimed that over $100 million was spent by US oil industry to create doubt. 1/2
3988 2018-08-16 15:16:17 United dropped loads too. We were comfortably ahead of you all season. Comfortably beat you at OT towards the end too. The table doesn't lie, if you were better you wouldn't be well behind us. Take your oil.

Norway is different, I figure, because of oil.
4000 2018-08-16 15:15:29 It is baffling that Republicans are allowing China to be the world leader in modern energy. Oil, gas, coal are the fuel of the past. The entire world is moving toward modern, clean, renewable energy. Why are Republicans against the future?

4017 2018-08-16 15:14:02 99% of recipes, you can halve the amount of oil, butter, and fat and still get a good tasting dish. It's very rare that an entire stick of butter is required, unless you are baking. Baking is a whole other thing.

4023 2018-08-16 15:13:03 Just read latest Citi Energy Weekly and whilst they own up to catastrophic oil price forecasts this year they are trying to hedge their bets by again going for ‘subdued prices’ for at least half a decade to come’. They just don’t understand it do they?

4036 2018-08-16 15:11:48 Really?

Homelessness and poverty is steadily increasing, right along side with increased oil production.

This is about making oil executives richer, with some trickle down coins for the lobbyists doing their dirty work...not about helping the poor!

4041 2018-08-16 15:11:35 Saw your paper when it came out - great read. All this is more evidence that land use change has a huge unrecognized impact on public health and economic growth. It might even cancel out the economic gains from palm oil in some regions.

4053 2018-08-16 15:10:08 Managed to powerlevel my cooking from 1 up to 110 using cost effective ingredients from AH. All for less than 2000 gold total. Stringy loins were severely undervalued (3% of MV!), and same for aromatic oil (10%). #Warcraft

4055 2018-08-16 15:10:07 18-24 months Oil is $150.
Why?
No capital expenditures from 2014-2018 to replace drawdown of oil.
+1.5% supply 2014 was -70%
-1% supply 2019 does what?
Gold falling makes lending more expensive in $/ounce

But no one complains more about the amount paid for oil going to any one of these destinations than you.

The discussion for the past months, has been about getting oil to tidewater, to oil tankers...so it can be put on the ocean.

4095 2018-08-16 15:05:13 Good to know! I thought I heard it was hard to get real CBD oil unless you live in a state where it's legal? Or did I just make that up in my head?
4096 2018-08-16 15:05:02 2021 is my bet. Mini temp oil peak with firming prices. Oil revenue back in the calcs and Brexit concerns settling and working reasonably. The SNP will then claim that if the UK can negotiate a good Brexit then we dont need the UK. The bampots will give ever louder applause.
4097 2018-08-16 15:04:53 True. Turkiye has been among the fastest-growing consumers of oil and gas among OECD members between 2010 and 2016. Therefore, we have been pursuing a smart energy diversification policy distributing the share of oil and gas imports to various suppliers and routes. Analysts see+

4102 2018-08-16 15:03:56 Indeed.  And just imagine what an oil spoil could do...
4103 2018-08-16 15:03:56 Ok so I'm gonna use a food metaphor...imagine Democracy as a vinaigrette...so oil is to a vinaigrette as a free press is to a Democracy? Can we explore the idea?
4104 2018-08-16 15:03:52 And there is also no mechanism whatsoever in the GDP to subtract value. 

The most valuable oil tanker journey in history for a country’s GDP  was the Exxon Valdez. Even Kinder Morgan factored in spill clean up as a beneficial economic activity.

Slice kale into chiffonade strips, massage other ingredients in, let stand for a couple hours at room temp, enjoy! 
4112 2018-08-16 15:03:07 There performance is relative to the abundance of resources.. don't forget a barrel of crude oil was selling at over a $100/ barrel for a long stretch. So there performance relative to the resources at there disposal was abysmal.. check World bank report.. for the period
4113 2018-08-16 15:03:05 My mum takes her make up off with olive oil, not sure if that’s a hack or her just being weird. Useful when you run out of eye make up remover!

4123 2018-08-16 15:01:45 I ask because none of these pessimists are qualified to make any of these pronouncements. Oil isn't magic. Like any other resource it is subject to market forces and the profits can be mismanaged.
4124 2018-08-16 15:01:29 Will wait...just a ponder...we crude oil prices rose..I believe there were stock already from the last purchase..but this petrol stations always adjust their prices immediately...n the law is vacuum on this..

4131 2018-08-16 15:01:03 ok so to be clear - the menhaden oil was designed to provide some of the 1: 14 Om 3 ?  and to that exent these fats do not meet the criteria for being purely vegan?  What else would not fit into a vegetarian diet ?

4162 2018-08-16 14:58:23 "Besides which, it's British oil!"
That's her wee red rag to indy posters - get a whole conversation going on the merits of who owns the oil.
That will let her post loads of misinformation about oil & the way it's managed - & for who's benefit.
Then her followers will spread it.

4165 2018-08-16 14:58:16 Also, a code of ethics is only as good as the people who are charged with implementing it.  If you promise to consult with First Nations regarding pipelines and oil extraction, and then you don't, then the ethical guidelines have no merit.
4166 2018-08-16 14:58:11 Atal ji was ahead of his times when his government made a diplomatic push to acquire a 20 per cent stake in the gigantic Sakhalin-I oil and gas fields in far east Russia for USD 1.7 billion in 2001. This was India's single largest investment abroad.

4184 2018-08-16 14:55:15 That is a problem with the press. Not with the study. Palmitic acid is a chemical. It makes no difference to the animal if it came from butter or from palm oil (2 main sources). The characterisation of this as vegetarian or vegan or carnivore has no relevance.

4243 2018-08-16 14:49:37 I think you should open up a history book.  Canada's principles stop at Twitter.  They are happy to sell weapons and buy oil from KSA as we speak Freeland is grovelling for KSA not to cancel contracts.

4249 2018-08-16 14:48:59 So after a number of of hours researching: it seems Toyota knew there is a problem with the 2AZ-FE engine developing high oil consumption after 100k they quietly extended warranty to 150k in a TSB but didn't highlight it in the hopes that few would notice...

4252 2018-08-16 14:48:25 I'm on @Tornpaige side here... I love that movie, and its definitely more comedy than drama.  From Affleck's oil rig chase scene to Michael Clarke Duncan's chase to the group's demands for doing the job, to Every Buscemi scene... Way more comedy than anything else.

4254 2018-08-16 14:48:15 Olive oil is not something that gets used in my kitchen lightly: I use it in practically everything I cook, and I cook a lot. Still, I'm always shocked just how quickly I can get through a bottle — and by how expensive my olive oil habit can be.

World-famous for their "Zeets", but ask them for the best pizza you've ever had and you'll get it. Has a seasoning-infused oil slick on top. My mouth is watering...

4261 2018-08-16 14:47:52 you guys act like it's new news. since the day usa invaded Iraq, you thought you're smart selling your oil to whomever you want. what you missed is that all oil revenues are deposited in the USA treasury amd the US gives iraq its yearly budget income.

Why did Mr. Johnson sleep under the oil truck? He wanted to get up oily in the morning.
4264 2018-08-16 14:47:29 You've been amazing. Always carrying yourself and team with great character and respect. There's nothing like being a father and any man or parent understands your decision. I remember when I was 9 and you got in oil at dover while leading and spun, I cried  thanks for memories
4265 2018-08-16 14:47:28 This may be the time  two firm wells are due to be drilled soon. The Cormorant-1 well operated by Tullow is only 2 weeks away & then Chariot will be drilling Prospect S using the same rig. Exciting times ahead for Namibia and for those invested in the Namibian Oil Industry

4270 2018-08-16 14:47:09 RCMP now arresting heroes protesting the pollution of our coast, the building of a dirty oil pipeline against the express will of the people of BC, and handing our hard-earned money to Texas oil giants for free. Climate Change is an emergency. Shame on @JustinTrudeau & enablers.
4271 2018-08-16 14:47:08 Yeah, they’re like oil and water. Well, my guess is there’s more to come.
4272 2018-08-16 14:47:07 I assume this is about roundup but the link you provided doesn't work.  However, if it is about roundup, pleased to report that yesterday I used agricultural strength vinegar and orange oil as weedkiller and along with the sun's help it worked great :)

4276 2018-08-16 14:46:48 @KerriMPR My pet conspiracy theory is that the oil companies have long discouraged electric car development. General motors produced an electric car in the 1990s with more rain than what they produce today… and then it just disappeared
4277 2018-08-16 14:46:42 Between weather and work and waiting on oil change its understandable. Plus you have time until snow flies.

4283 2018-08-16 14:45:25 We wash house dogs - belly, paws - diligently because the water makes them scratchy even otherwise. The chaps who live out there are worse off :( Was thinking today - in some countries a beach with so much oil would be 'closed'...

4285 2018-08-16 14:45:18 Oh and we can afford the results of #climatecatastrophe if we don’t stop using fossil fuels?  560 fires currently burning out of control in BC. In Japan 22 000 hospitalized from record high heat and 95 dead. The Arctic is on fire! Yes. The Arctic! That is the true cost of oil.
4286 2018-08-16 14:45:08 Then add some butter or oil and maybe some fitting cheese. Most kinds of fish would have been great too

4379 2018-08-16 14:35:54 Facebook should be shutdown immediately. I have no use for such a drama filled shithole. 

You know how I lose my shit over drama. I can't handle it I explode. FB and me are oil and water.
4380 2018-08-16 14:35:54 You wouldn’t know a truthful statement if it bit you. You are a conman and low class snake oil salesman that says whatever suits his agenda at the moment never mind if it is actually true. Please answer: do you really believe everything you say?
4381 2018-08-16 14:35:54 the oil mentioned isn't CBD oil ;) it's RSO or FECO
add myrrh, hops and frankiscence and you have a powerful cure for all cancers

4383 2018-08-16 14:35:29 History is nonsense? Britain’s objectives in the ME & hence always pacifying Arabs was always about oil. This region was bad 100 yrs ago, nothing changed. T E Lawrence reported on Fighting & Distrust between tribes, promises were not trustworthy. The British don’t give up.

4385 2018-08-16 14:35:11 @SecretaryZinke - we learned in Iraq we can’t kill our way to victory. We know we can’t clear our way to prevent forest fires. It isn’t terrorists creating western fires. It’s men like you are in the pocket of Big Oil who don’t get climate change. RENEW PARIS ACCORD! #saveouranet

4405 2018-08-16 14:32:39 I have OPINIONS about the olive oil virgin mary statue:
4406 2018-08-16 14:32:39 "BP, bringing oil to US shores."
4407 2018-08-16 14:32:36 Wrong.  The UK govt made the decision to use the oil money to benefit people now. That is what pays your generous benefits, our top heavy public services, our low taxation, etc., etc.  Even with their oil fund, Norway are deep in debt
4408 2018-08-16 14:32:35 Trump hasn’t done anything for conservatism because he has no conservative values. He’s a carnival barker and a snake oil salesman.
4409 2018-08-16 14:32:32 Yeah I need my singers to have the oil... whether you're singing gospel or secular. I want to hear the oil

4424 2018-08-16 14:30:48 Sat beside a CEO of an oil company on the way over to the Netherlands last week. I asked him if he had any advice for a young CEO, he said, “Be authentic. People can see through what’s not real”.

4427 2018-08-16 14:30:38 If "Petro" works out it's solving what problem? 

It's by-passing USD, not really. Oil is priced in dollars outside venezuela even if you price in bolivars or rubles or the token Petro inside the country. Ethereum was around $800 in Feb when token launched its now only $300.

4439 2018-08-16 14:29:32 My favorite was when my MIL asked me if I could have olive oil.

4446 2018-08-16 14:28:10 The $ went as high N500+ at some point during this administration; hence the 18th straight month-on-month CPI decline continues the climb-down which largely results from stronger oil prices and CBN $ interventions amid stable oil output.

Structural weaknesses remain unaddressed.

4451 2018-08-16 14:27:43 As others have noted, ask about oil consumption (head gaskets), and timing belt. Otherwise the price seems good so I say "yay".

4461 2018-08-16 14:26:59 Goya oil is produced in Spain. The churches can establish an oil producing factory and encourage people to patronize the company's oil for church activities but no they had to patronize a Spanish company. Shame on pastors. My people are zombies I swear. Mumu for years.

4463 2018-08-16 14:26:55 I believe greed and mismanagement are the roots corruption in Nigeria and it's been so since the 80s. 

Especially Oil corruption. The cost of oil corruption today is the inability of states Governors to pay their workers' wages and salaries. #DGTrends #AfricaAgainstCorruption

4466 2018-08-16 14:26:30 Demand for oil is expected to grow globally until 2030 at least. Developing countries all need a cheap source of energy to help in their development. We could take advantage of this for the benefit of our country or we could let other countries benefit from this.
4467 2018-08-16 14:26:27 If you want to take this literally, fine, but know that you are not reading His Word accurately and you have been taught wrongly. Jesus also said he was The Vine and The Door. Yet nowhere does he say turn my handles and oil my hinges or prune my leaves and smell my flowers.

4480 2018-08-16 14:25:16 Possibly, as far as campaign overspending is concerned, though certain snake oil salesmen of #leave are extremely slippery, on the aspects of the dark money and dubious associations.
Either way, investigations into any acts of criminality should continue on both sides.

After all even our own government does not treat its own people with respect.
Instead they work with underhanded countries like Israel.

4518 2018-08-16 14:21:06 You can say that over and over and over, but no one is buying your snake oil.  The Democratic Party is a mess as evidenced by its leanings towards socialism and supposed old school party leaders who don’t think America was ever great and want big brother government back.

4523 2018-08-16 14:20:07 Did Obama renegotiate the tariffs we were paying to China saving us billions? Did Obama roll back regulations that were keeping us behind the middle east in oil production? Did Obama cut the corporate tax rate that led to wide spread bonuses? Nope
4524 2018-08-16 14:19:59 In my region, it is big oil. they don't donate to help the citizens here, they donate to make sure that they can encroach on farmland and not get a lawsuit out of it. just like every where else. As for taxes most of the money comes from the citizens and small business not them.

4533 2018-08-16 14:18:54 Chemical notation of any BF younger than Lignite  is +/- C6H12O6 or 6(C-H2O)
Burning BF is effectively 6C to 6CO2 at around 600degrC and heating 6 H2O, just to form clouds
In effect Burning Coal (de-oxidised Lignite) is at 32Gj/t and Lignite only 16 Gj/t Oil=45Gj/t, Oil has no O2

4578 2018-08-16 14:14:39 The boom came from a roll back of regulations that allowed our oil companies to better compete with the middle east, the trade deals with China, and the corporate tax cuts. None of that has anything to do with the Obama admin.

4603 2018-08-16 14:11:45 Not really calling for more common sense there is demand for oil and gas out East and a plentiful supply out West. If we could supply the demand from our own country it could be mutually beneficial. Job stability out West assured supply out East displacing foreign oil.

4640 2018-08-16 14:06:57 Olive oil is good! But the flavor might not go the best with eggs. Just about any oil except vegetable oil and margarine are good.
4641 2018-08-16 14:06:21 just because Canada isn't as bad as others, doesn't give us a pass. Big oil owns politicians everywhere. Nothing I can say or do will change that.

4655 2018-08-16 14:04:52 It's a processed vegetable oil, so avoid.
4656 2018-08-16 14:04:50 Or, perhaps, to support your personal agenda we should continue importing oil from dictatorships and countries with very questionable human rights? Our Canadian oil is produced ethically, sustainability and most import of all it has provided many with a standard of life.
4657 2018-08-16 14:04:47 Lastly it is always good to put oil in your hair the type of oil depends on you NOTE that different oils do different things

4659 2018-08-16 14:04:32 By december, except something new happen, some oil marketers will remember a problem they have with govt, or police will slap a tanker driver & they will all go on strike & put us through collective hardship. I pray this year to be different.

Less is best. You don't want products building up on your locs.

4745 2018-08-16 13:54:33 I actually spray the bowl with some olive oil spray before I crack the eggs in the bowl. Just a light spray it doesn’t stick at all.

4784 2018-08-16 13:50:16 The price of everything will go up because crude oil is purchased in dollars. Resulting in expensive transportation. Food, labour, import and export will become expensive... poor man will have to pay extra.

But otherwise...this is a horrible plan.

4796 2018-08-16 13:49:27 I'm a millennial who loves mayo! Extra please... it has to be organic with cage free eggs and certified non-gmo of course. And don't forget mayo with avocado oil!  I prefer @sirkensingtons if anyone's wondering :-)  @SandyHingston

4798 2018-08-16 13:49:21 I usually spray them with canola oil cooking spray before putting the eggs in. It works great!
4799 2018-08-16 13:49:10 Hell literally look like an Adonis. Add some olive or baby oil rubbed on his chest.... mmmm

4801 2018-08-16 13:49:05 true, like what kind of oil ?? where do i find it ?
4802 2018-08-16 13:48:52 They are rich because of oil. Their social values haven't even reached the 20th century let alone the 21st. Women can't vote. Can't walk unattended. Homosexuality receives the death penalty. Honour killing partially legal etc etc
4803 2018-08-16 13:48:49 Nagcacastor oil para humaba pilik tapos pag mahaba na gugupitin ko din hehe abno lang diba 
4804 2018-08-16 13:48:42 Agreed, red beans & rice! Fat=olive oil, a bit at the beginning & add more toward end. Think of spices used w meat & + those. Ie, thyme, bay, ++ whole blk peppercorns, garlic.

4808 2018-08-16 13:48:18 Ya WCW aint get an oil change in two years and all her lights on on her dashboard. She got a grenade on wheels
4809 2018-08-16 13:48:14 Trump will blackmail Saudi Arabia to stop the deal with Tesla on National Security in exchange of an oil price manipulated till mid- term elections..... it's written in the sky....
4810 2018-08-16 13:48:11 Never understand why people find it acceptable to oil themselves up in a packed changing room.
4811 2018-08-16 13:48:08 Mustard, ranch (on the right circumstances), hummus is bomb, mashed avocados, oil/vinger...

4814 2018-08-16 13:47:56 #Telko, daughter company of #Aspo Plc, has acquired Danish lubricants distribution company Square Oil’s business in Norway and Denmark. Fit to Telko is excellent with same main supllier BP Castrol in both companies. Welcome Square Oil personnel to Telko family! #Www.aspo.com
4815 2018-08-16 13:47:55 They point us to this while conspicuously ignoring the fact that their oil shipments are ongoing and haven't even faltered. Harper is just stirring up shit because that's the way he rolls. Typical Tory. #cdnpoli
4816 2018-08-16 13:47:47 i have oil paint dont worry about it
4817 2018-08-16 13:47:29 Why is the oil smeared hot guy a trope. Have any of you felt oil on your skin. Fucking disgusting. It's like advanced super mud
4818 2018-08-16 13:47:27 We are going to let China via Cuba to suck our oil out from us.
4819 2018-08-16 13:47:22 I suspect it was all his own work. He truly believes he is a great statesman and not just the branch manager for Big Oil and Guns Inc (Near East division) and over-indulged grubby little crook.
4820 2018-08-16 13:47:15 Its a simple logic - respect nature, say no to deforestation, mining, plastics, oil drilling, destruction of rivers, lakes, mountain, anything that is part of natural environment. this happens When it cross a limit in the name of development/whatever. #Keralaflood #climatechange
4821 2018-08-16 13:47:08 Every time I go to apapa i weep for Nigeria those in the position of leadership just choose to be cruel to the citizens . Apart from the oil & Gas industry the revenue from the apapa sea port super seeds the internally generated revenue of the entire 19 northern states .
4822 2018-08-16 13:47:01 That feel when you bring your truck for an oil change and end up spending $500 for other stuff that’s wrong with it lmao at least my wallet won’t bulge out of my pocket now
4823 2018-08-16 13:46:52 ไม่ชอบคนเมาหัวราน้ำ
4824 2018-08-16 13:46:50 probably because the media doesnt teach you to give saudi shit cos theyre supplying all the oil, meaning the liberal mob never gets told to give them shit

consider yourself redpilled gamer
4825 2018-08-16 13:46:46 Iyes.. Cocok banget asdfg!

Tapi masih ada dry patches dan pake toner / nivea+baby oil kurang mantul. Aku bingung

4831 2018-08-16 13:45:50 “The wheat in question was found along an oil and gas lease service road about 300 kilometres away from where Monsanto’s trials were taking place.”  This why we don’t have GMO wheat: escapes.

4836 2018-08-16 13:45:30 Yes, familiar. We've been campaigning it for years, and little progress. Oil rigs begin in September, & fracking test drilling is under way. Packages of land and ocean have been licensed off to oil and gas drilling for a couple of years now. Prayer is a good option at this stage.
4837 2018-08-16 13:45:22 武士の話は何気に笑わせてもらいましたねwケンタッキーフライドチキンのは私的にちょっと微妙でしたがwあとOILと３回書いてピリオドを付けると、サザエさんのED曲っぽくなるもwしかし 11:3=B、ぷ。は素晴らしい発見ですなwwwwww
4838 2018-08-16 13:45:18 I have to wait who knows how long for my oil to get changed so you bet I’m about to eat all their snacks and play with their showroom cars

4849 2018-08-16 13:44:14 No. Just do oil based. I take risks with Alfredo. But I can’t live that life anymore.
4850 2018-08-16 13:44:06 If you've got a spreadsheet or charts on this it's an oil well's worth of content. DM me.
4851 2018-08-16 13:44:01 Yes simple oil cleansing :)
4852 2018-08-16 13:43:58 Please study history of Muslim culture & practices many of which have been transported here such as belief in Sharia, honor killings, genital mutilation of girls, one girl was recently hit with hot oil by her parents because she refused to marry a much older man,arranged marriage
4853 2018-08-16 13:43:55 Unemployment is at an all time low. there are more jobs than people to fill them. So Not sure where you are getting your data from. As far as food prices, that's been increasing since 2008. It has to do with rising costs of oil and cord subsidizing among other factors.
4854 2018-08-16 13:43:50 I’m merely saying that natural gas is cleaner & cheaper than oil & coal & it’s a local resource. It’s a stop gap until renewables are cheaper.
4855 2018-08-16 13:43:32 If you are doing scrambled eggs add vegetable oil this will make it easier to clean the dish
4856 2018-08-16 13:43:28 I’m getting my oil changed this morning and on the waiting room tv the news is telling a story about how a bunch of kids who were born via donor (and had the same donor) get together as a family reunion and it’s pretty cute because the kids call each other brother and sister

4858 2018-08-16 13:43:26 Daft question but did you use the correct grade of oil, if so was it an aftermarket one or from Volvo.

4862 2018-08-16 13:43:10 What kind of business has you spend hours in their place working with you to get you exactly what you want, payments that you approve of, you sign all the papers , agree to 3 year warranty and oil changes to increase payment, announces over pa congrats on your new jeep...
4863 2018-08-16 13:42:57 Went in for an oil change, came out with an oil change and 2 new tires... I ain’t even mad though #thankful
4864 2018-08-16 13:42:54 Yes, the molds are in fact a platinum silicone called Mold Star. As with any molding I apply a fine mist of release oil in the mold prior to pouring the actual toy silicone into it.
4865 2018-08-16 13:42:42 I have to create a will, but decided I want to be incinerated/slow cooked in an industrial sized oil tank smoker and my ashes kept in a 24 oz Monster Ultra can. I you know me, it makes the most sense whilst most cost effective.
4866 2018-08-16 13:42:41 Ziggy's getting new strut mounts and an oil change today. Lucky her.
4867 2018-08-16 13:42:40 Didn't Tory govt. just recently cancel a 1.3 mio GBP Project of renewable energy (Swindon?) ?
That could've replaces some oil or nuclear plants...
4868 2018-08-16 13:42:39 The rose quartz comb probably comes from your posts about Steven Universe.  No idea what ghost oil is, though.
4869 2018-08-16 13:42:34 I have a friend with some knowledge of the CIA and this is what he told me. I asked him why the opposition when he is giving "them"everything they want. I used the word "them" but was not referring specifically to Israel but also oil and mining companies, etc.
4870 2018-08-16 13:42:28 if you have oily skin it still lacks moisture, your body is trying to compensate this with oil production, but yeah the word choice is kinda off lol

4873 2018-08-16 13:42:09 While most will fixate on what’s written on the tactics board in the background, who sits next to who, body language, etc, I will focus on the details. What beard oil Aguero uses, what music KDB listens to, does hair ever grow on pep’s head
4874 2018-08-16 13:42:06 it’s oil, not paint.

4885 2018-08-16 13:41:06 Coat the inside with cooking spray or olive oil. If some is still stuck on afterwards, let soak in hot, soapy water for a while before cleaning.
4886 2018-08-16 13:40:53 Chelsea is a 50-50, but you should really check about Khaldoon Al Mubarak. They are not as simple as oil cunts. 
Just make things clear, I support LFC, and am not an American.

4888 2018-08-16 13:40:47 Thanks everyone for all the responses. I also have been using My Daily Choice sprays, I  have been using Peak, Sleep, Boost & Shield. Together with CBD Oil it works. I sleep like a baby and wake energised. Getting lots of work done. Loving life!!!
4889 2018-08-16 13:40:46 Hi - We're sorry if you were alarmed! What you're seeing is a mixture of oil and crumbs that can sometimes form during packaging. In order to report this to our bakery, could you please send us a DM with the UPC, expiration date, and the letters and numbers that follow? Thanks!

4903 2018-08-16 13:39:53 Just crashed into a lorry transporting omega 3 tablets. It’s ok though, I only sustained super fish oil injuries.. #BeMoreChildish
4904 2018-08-16 13:39:41 Started putting coconut oil under my foreskin :3 kinda smells nice
4905 2018-08-16 13:39:33 Butternut squash, broccoli and peppers tossed in oil, rosemary and sea salt (though have previously used carrots, baby corn, aubergine to similar affect!) Added vegetable stock, rosemary, paprika and a bit of cayenne to the cous cous. SO tasty!
4906 2018-08-16 13:39:25 Portobello burgers help me out. I grill with olive oil and garlic and top with smoked Gouda. Topped naan bread with the burger, guac and pico & had a flavor party!
4907 2018-08-16 13:39:14 I couldn't watch it. The destruction of their habitat due to our collective use of palm oil is too upsetting. The orphanage does wonderful work and does its best but these beautiful creatures should be in the wild. Shame on corporations for using #PalmOil
4908 2018-08-16 13:39:13 I need a oil changeand I'm tired jiffy lubes charging me 80$ for a damn oil change

4917 2018-08-16 13:37:58 glad all i needed was an oil change 
4918 2018-08-16 13:37:50 I want a free press, but I also want a press that discloses it's own political agenda and interests up front. I'm tired of having my news filtered and in some cases squashed (Standing Rock Sioux Tribe oil pipeline protests) because the owners of the media are pals with big oil.
4919 2018-08-16 13:37:50 OIL! MONEY! SLAVES!
4920 2018-08-16 13:37:47 Thank you for doing this Liam cause a lot of orangutans lose their home to palm oil companies
4921 2018-08-16 13:37:43 You can compare what oil companies say they have found in each country to investors and expect to be extracting. It is not perfect but it gives a business model some teeth. The new oil finds are mostly in the Scottish sector. many of the new gas finds are in the English sector.
4922 2018-08-16 13:37:32 My general feeling, however, is that we need to stop using veg. oil from developing countries and go back to using oils from plants grown in mainland Europe/UK, as well using butter from UK and mainland Europe.
4923 2018-08-16 13:37:31 S-oil인데요ㅜㅜ
4924 2018-08-16 13:37:23 If I was a chick, I would never be broke

I would be covering my feet in oil and selling the pics
4925 2018-08-16 13:37:11 Even though the plague had wiped out all known civilisation, they still had each other. For now, at least. Jack stood on top of the pink oil drum to survey the hellscape that had once been Wimbledon High St. “Well?” said Susan. “They’re coming”, said Jack grimly.

4929 2018-08-16 13:36:28 Poach them - in water for 1.5 -2 min on full blast and they should be good. Also quick omelet is good as well - just grease bowl with butter/oil/spray oil and you are good to go. Don’t forget to cover bowl with catering cling film.
4930 2018-08-16 13:36:15 Keystone Pipeline is being made with enclosed pipe that will keep oil or gas from escaping into the environment. It’s not rocket science. Judges ruling sounds political.
4931 2018-08-16 13:35:58 great to see @nefariousemma backing @Greenpeace again - this time to save forests from destruction for palm oil. Don’t give a? imagine your local biodiverse woodland being trashed for consumers 10,000 miles away. we don’t need palm oil & we don’t need to ruin distant habitats
4932 2018-08-16 13:35:54 คิดไม่ดียังไงอะ
4933 2018-08-16 13:35:51 Btw your argument was the inefficiency and cost of RE referring to a graph made by a company that bases bottom line on oil and gas regarding countries they have less business in because their source beyond wind and sun has been nuclear power.

4938 2018-08-16 13:34:57 Boosting U.S. energy dominance

The Department of Interior, which has led the way in cutting regulations, opened plans to lease 77 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico for oil and gas drilling.Trump traveled the world to promote the sale and use of U.S. energy.

4967 2018-08-16 13:30:56 Palm oil is one big fat, why? We have tons of oils to choose from, there's no need for it in the first place, much less at the cost of orangutans and rain forest. People are stupid a-holes.
4968 2018-08-16 13:30:56 Are you particularly stupid or just slow today?

I said:
1. It doesn't matter how the buyer; any buyer gets income. 
2. The Japanese get income by working hard. Qataris get theirs sitting idle as their state sells oil. 

Both are capable buyers. They encourage sellers, markets.

5017 2018-08-16 13:26:10 I thought it was said in the White Paper that oil was a bonus but the data was included in the forecast income? In other words it was a plain lie.

The SGC report discounts any revenue from oil on the basis that it is not material in controlling the deficit or reducing the debt.

5025 2018-08-16 13:25:21 In general, ours is also debt based economy. In my opinion, unless we decouple dollar and go for alternative way of buying crude oil, we may see high inflation, slow down etc. Luckily our people are hard working.

5049 2018-08-16 13:22:38 Well...You would be surprised with how much incorrect information is put out there..Sometimes even by professional journalists. At the end of the day the US produces around 10.5-11m bpd of crude oil and consumes just under 21m bpd so it is still adding to the deficit.

5068 2018-08-16 13:21:18 Too much exfoliating can cause over production of oil!! #StopTheMadness
5069 2018-08-16 13:21:12 Honestly burning stuff is way harder than I thought. Being an arsonist must either be a lot of luck or actually a true skill because gallons of diesel and oil say otherwise. Then again I probably just burned it too fast.

5075 2018-08-16 13:20:44 Political struggle implies “competing interest groups or individuals for power and leadership”.  After Democrats let Perez bow to fossil donations & all-of-the-above energy, that isn’t to blame. A leaderless US is #1 in global consumption, 2 oil producer, and failing the planet.
5076 2018-08-16 13:20:41 "Emerging market economies pay for oil in U.S. dollars, meaning a high greenback against the local currency makes the commodity more expensive. The dollar recently hit a 13-month high against a basket of foreign currencies" from CNBC
5077 2018-08-16 13:20:13 US 10 year not even bugging much TBH, oil up a little, US dollar only down slightly.  Down day for riskoff, is this trade over though?  I say no, will look to add to US 10 year and dollar on weakness today

5080 2018-08-16 13:19:51 Um? What data set are you actually using? 
Justin has destroyed the oil, lumber and mining industries, with his policies...and all the spin off jobs and investment money that comes with those industries.
5081 2018-08-16 13:19:44 Everyone's?
5082 2018-08-16 13:19:43 Religion has got to be one of the biggest scams I've ever seen. Sell people a bit of oil, and when they suffer for it say a few calming words and act like that cured them. 

You guys will be held accountable. All of you.

5086 2018-08-16 13:19:22 This was so touching, I almost cried. I showed it to my 15 year old daughter and she was so moved. I have explained about palm oil and the destruction of the rainforest to her, she says it must stop. Thank you for making this video, I will do everything I can to help stop this .

5093 2018-08-16 13:18:41 Tthe confusions here is what tax are we talking about? OECD definitions of subsidy seem to relate to the price paid by the consumer at the pump and the tax related to that. By far the biggest tax subsidy in the UK is to oil producers for exploration. That's where the problem is.
5094 2018-08-16 13:18:33 These perks are oil money.
5095 2018-08-16 13:18:29 As of January 2014, the 27 petroleum refineries in Texas had a capacity of over 5.1 million barrels of crude oil per day and accounted for 29% of total U.S. refining capacity. #petroleummeeting #petroleumevent #naturalgasevent #http://petroleum-engineering.alliedacademies.com/

5097 2018-08-16 13:18:09 Sophy, we should always research before we engage, Atiku Abubakar as of today is Nigeria’s third largest employer of labour in Nigeria after FG X Dangote, he’s invested in agriculture, oil, health care and education, he knows how job creation works, do you Know these things!!!

5101 2018-08-16 13:17:32 Sir, do you think India capitulating to US pressure to cut oil imports from Iran played a role in this?

5104 2018-08-16 13:17:04 Chef Ramses cut up some live rats, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a fine cut of beef, along with Silly Putty.
5105 2018-08-16 13:17:02 Pat, pat, patting you on the back...Hang in there. CBD oil & smoking or ingesting certain Indica cannabis strains has helped my husband deal w/his chronic pain from arthritis. He takes the CBD oil during the day, doesn't end the pain, but makes a diff, & makes work more pleasant.

5111 2018-08-16 13:16:31 Climate change. Where I live, there'll be 30ft of water in 50 years time of we don't solve it. Adding more coal and oil isn't going to solve that.

5117 2018-08-16 13:15:36 Which were 50K teacher placards in excess of legal DOE parking spots. How can he consider himself a leader on climate change (sue the oil companies! Such courage), which requires people to alter habits, when he won’t go to a local gym & instead takes a 13 car motorcade 8 miles.
5118 2018-08-16 13:15:04 Trump’s a neocon puppet—BushBama 3.0 carrying out PNAC playbook. He said let’s leave Syria & they faked gas attack so he’d send missiles. Lee Camp article ^^ documents Trump’s massive military escalations. He personally invests in gas & oil. US military occupies Syrian oil fields

Dissassembling the machine to rebuild is a lot harder (and costlier) than draining the oil and refilling with cleaner oil.
5122 2018-08-16 13:14:46 Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) produce about 44.1% of the world's crude oil, and possess almost 81.5% of the world's total proven crude oil reserves, according to OPEC and US Energy Information Administration data. #https://lnkd.in/fxTu2uh

5125 2018-08-16 13:14:06 You are irrelevant. You won’t even support our own country’s oil and gas industry. Soon you will be a foot note in Canadian political history. What seat do you hold in parliament again?
5126 2018-08-16 13:13:56 Army Hawks in ur country don't want economic freedom to order ppl, if India & Pakistan become friends like US & Canada lot of money can be saved on oil,gas, transport, etc but ur country is slave to army hawks, hence #ABV was backstabed

5131 2018-08-16 13:13:36 bitcoin / ethereum are not a good comparison. ETH works like oil, and their leadership is opposed to ETH functioning as a store of value. a better comparison would be "what's your bitcoin / monero allocation ratio" for example.

5133 2018-08-16 13:13:25 Norway produces roughly twice as a much oil per day as the whole of the UK. You simply have no idea what you are talking about.

5135 2018-08-16 13:13:12 When one can be able to diversify resources in all aspects, from agriculture to oil to education and healthcare, do you know Atiku is third largest employer of labour in Nigeria after FG X Dangote!!!....

5137 2018-08-16 13:12:54 I made this one up: Yolkless egg noodles topped with lightly steamed broccoli, garlic sauteed in olive oil, and feta cheese. Cherry tomatoes do well in it too. Fast and yummpy.
5138 2018-08-16 13:12:43 
5139 2018-08-16 13:12:25 We need to protect our country, a large factor in the last recession was the doubling of oil prices in a short period of time and if we were self sufficient at the time it wouldn't have been so devastating to businesses thus the economy

5157 2018-08-16 13:10:18 John. I have patience but get real. Norway has less oil. fact. More future oil is in Scottish sector than Norway. Including west of Shetland. Fact. I have said oil is just one thing but it is worth 20 billion ayear if Norway model is copied. There is no argument there John. None.

5209 2018-08-16 13:04:28 Quick question Douglas.  Norway has an oil fund worth $1trn established less than 40 years ago, so do you think it possible that an independent Scotland could replicate this within a similar period, bearing in mind that under current (UK) management the UK's oil fund is worth $0?

5232 2018-08-16 13:00:49 I would have done an olive oil poached filet and lightly dusted the cheek in some rice flour and flash fried it (used as a garnish). Then probably some type of vegetable purée with a lot of citrus!! I can't believe no one used the cheek

5255 2018-08-16 12:58:10 .@EndangeredOcean We're hopeful the lack of interest in buying offshore oil leases is a good sign of smart corporate leaders. Still, there's a lot of work yet to be done to protect our waters and environment.

5259 2018-08-16 12:57:38 Norway doesn't have less oil. Your entire premise is daft. In 2014, when Salmond was predicting $113/barrel forever, he didn't even forecast enough revenue to cover the cost of the NHS. Yet here you are, when oil is around half that, claiming that it will pay for EVERYTHING.

5328 2018-08-16 12:48:21 No.. *real* aïoli can be made with or without egg yolk as an emulsifier—and in fact *with* egg is most common. But it’s oil and garlic that give it a name and flavor.. what is infuriating is when someone pours truffle oil into mayo and calls it aïoli
5329 2018-08-16 12:48:13 LOL.  Toxic diluent?  You mean....naptha, A.K.A. 'camp gas', A.K.A. lantern oil?

5359 2018-08-16 12:44:13 we subsidize oil/gas industry, but not geothermal. As we must stop using fossil fuels we must cut their subsidies & start incentivizing transition to geothermal / renewables. We also must stop subsidizing nuclear.  We're spending min $12.8B capex refurbishing Darlington.

5373 2018-08-16 12:42:31 A more interesting discussion is the real picture of US oil/and products exports and imports. The math is not so simple as the US both exports and imports both crude oil and refined products. There is a lot of confusion in this equation.

5493 2018-08-16 12:27:36 We should get a death count each day on the news of the number of lives we’re sacrificing in our frivolous wars that we constantly wage to keep oil prices low.

5494 2018-08-16 12:27:35 Shale is only a piece of the puzzle in the US trade deficit. I believe oil exports brought in under USD 30bn of revenue in all of 2017 against a total trade deficit of about USD 43bn per month !! So you see that shale is a small item in the middle of this huge deficit.

5594 2018-08-16 12:11:19 That's fair. I think we'll see something in the bullish camp re-appear next week. Perhaps a big U.S. draw that will shift sentiment. I'm long oil since 47 so happy with being knocked out or riding this back to 75.
5595 2018-08-16 12:11:12 Pour your oil on me. Let it fall down on me. From the top of my head to my feet. Pour your oil on me. Let it fall down on me. I want your glory, I want your glory. HERE’S MY HEART, HERE’S MY SOUL HOLY SPIRIT COME IN. FILL ME WITH YOUR COSUMING FIRE. @thejoshuarogers 
5596 2018-08-16 12:11:08 Like ending petroleum use.  What can petroleum do that Hemp cannot?  ...besides oil wars and pollution.

5614 2018-08-16 12:08:05 Way to take the moral high ground and call me a loser. Unlike McCain my actions have never killed anyone. But you insult me instead. I guess we know you value blind patriotism and killing for oil more than reason and sanity. Thank for your input.
5615 2018-08-16 12:07:44 It obviously doesn't matter who you vote for in Alberta, all parties are climate change deniers and will do nothing to upset big oil executives and their bank accounts.

5635 2018-08-16 12:04:11 Ahh you know, just another morning where I fuck with some type of oil product and have a problem. Currently shining and sparkling to the point I’ll blind ppl cause I poured too much body oil (with glitter in it might I add)into my hand.

5639 2018-08-16 12:03:56 unlikely, unfortunately, but I have a theory that it might be the pesticides they spray on the vineyards because nothing natural has ever caused such a reaction  but I've been taking nigella seed oil capsules and healing clay and I think they've generally been good for my skin!

5647 2018-08-16 12:01:51 Olive oil and eggs tastes weird. I used it once out of desperation because my roommate used all my butter. Never again.
5648 2018-08-16 12:01:42 It's not @sagarikaghose fault.. it's result of excessive Italian oil which destroyed ear drums and Italian guilty food left over by Vatican destroyed brain cells @nishashah88 @birajanath @chitrapadhi @dr_aktiku @AkKhanna61 @prafullaketkar @communalsandeep @sardesairajdeep @kush07

5668 2018-08-16 11:59:30 which cleanser do you use? even low ph cleanser (like cosrx low ph cleanser with its tea tree oil ingredient) can also dry out your skin in long-term use. My suggestion try low ph cleanser with more soothing property (like panthenol), up your moisturising game
5669 2018-08-16 11:59:29 Tesla is noted for its electric cars but the most significant development may be in energy storage.  This will impact electric energy producers, oil producers and coal producers. Storing renewable energy has been the missing link.
5670 2018-08-16 11:59:20 Sure, I suppose it also has to do with the west's interests, oil is important & Iran is geographically in the US's way, our minerals are important for them, that is why I believe they will invade, India is big, China is currently developing Nuclear weapons but their a big country
5671 2018-08-16 11:59:19 A little spray non stick oil before you start makes clean up easier. Or make in a freezer zip bag then "boil" in a bowl of hot water.
5672 2018-08-16 11:59:16 Not quite tgat age ( i'm 62 ) but do remember the polio collecting boxes and the cod liver oil . Trouble is these people in our age group are totally entrenched but they are now on the back foot. They are not so "open" about voting Leave and prefer not to talk about it.
5673 2018-08-16 11:59:10 Done! DROP PALM OIL!
5674 2018-08-16 11:59:08 Do NOT assume that in have no grasp on the economy. But Westminster have taken oil money and used it for vanity projects that have little or no worth to the rest of the UK. SON a one trick pony?? Well, similar could be said about Labour and Tory. They ALL  have an agenda
5675 2018-08-16 11:59:04 You are right. We flew over massive cultivated areas of Palm Oil plantations. Very sad....and a problem all over the world.
We have created too many people and it is still rising.

We have oil.
We have Geothermal.
We have enough recources
Leave the animals alone
5688 2018-08-16 11:57:14 Strange.  We were the only 1st World nation NOT to go through a recession after G.W. Bush and Wall Street a$$-raped the U.S. economy.  That was a tough time for you guys.  We sent you CARE packages.  Did you get them?  Lots of Vegemite, woolly socks, oil and gold.

5706 2018-08-16 11:54:08 Put water on the plate, enough to cover baked on egg.  30 seconds on hi should do it.  If not, repeat.  Next time you cook eggs in micro, spray cooking oil (I use canola butter flavor spray) on the plate, cook at 50% power until eggs are to your liking. Time varies 2-3min..

Putting you in front of a camera is like letting Olive Oil reading the news! She was more intelligent though!
5718 2018-08-16 11:52:14 All I could advise for someone going to speed you up is go from 2 to 1 to prevent any cross contamination, and be careful as accelerating at the speed with oil can be dangerous 
5719 2018-08-16 11:52:03 It is not snake oil and does work but whole question is to what extent

5728 2018-08-16 11:50:21 Renewable Energy using corn is a clean solution for electricity and gasoline. It's by-product is water. Oil drilling must also stop. There is a correlation between Shale Gas and Crude Oil to the Magnetism in the Earth's core protecting the Earth from becoming a dead Planet.
5729 2018-08-16 11:50:01 So basically this was a totally  Vegan oil content/ no animal fats at all?

5738 2018-08-16 11:48:42 Whatever base your foundation is, you want to use the same base for foundation. For example, an oil based moisturizer under a water base foundation will not work well together.
5739 2018-08-16 11:48:34 Some fools inject an oil called synthol instead of going to the gym
5740 2018-08-16 11:48:28 Maybe throw a picture of elixir of snake oil in there
5741 2018-08-16 11:48:11 OMG I was thinking about that the other day Pauley and I was thinking maybe put some kind of oil light whatever oil you might use olive oil and regular oil vegetable oil or butter just makes it a little slick that might work I was going to try it this morning myself

5746 2018-08-16 11:46:53 Eastern Canada imported oil from outside North America while you were an MP, @jkenney. Why didn’t your gouvernement fix this? You had the economic conditions, a majority, and a love for big oil. You you did nothing. I blame you, personally, as much as the liberals.
5747 2018-08-16 11:46:40 They said a phenomenon like some of dont remember the oil spill in the gulf

5755 2018-08-16 11:45:12 Would it be possible to provide a simple breakdown which shows the oil content of each of your sample diets - so that readers can see what proportion was Om 6, om 3, sat fat and mono fat in each of your diets from the 5% to the 80% .    Is that shown in a table somewhere?

The East has the key to unlock Nigeria's potential stop being afraid of them, support them.
5762 2018-08-16 11:44:42 It just reinforces that it’s a foreign country, unlike what the yoons pretend - ‘we’re all one yoonited kingdom’  Strange that they don’t show the same contempt towards Scottish oil, gas, electricity, water, profit from food exports and territory…
5763 2018-08-16 11:44:36 use plastic bowls and spray them lightly with olive oil first. :) My daughter makes her eggs in the micro and I refused to wash her dishes. :D

5770 2018-08-16 11:44:00 Only 13% of the oceans are not suffering from intense human activities, according to a new study. Overfishing, oil drilling and other profit-based activities are destroying the wilderness in our oceans, affecting its entire ecosystems in the process. #overfishing #ProtectOurCoast

No, Pipelines !
5772 2018-08-16 11:43:21 Ur fixated on oil for everything every time. USA economy is doing great now. It appreciated against euro also? That doesn’t mean some other country is doing bad. One of the least effected currency is Rupee.

5778 2018-08-16 11:43:00 According to the report, the oil and gas industries have a lot of work to do to prepare for the emerging cyber risks. These industries will likely continue to be an attractive target due to the rise of the industrial internet of things and the potential for mass disruptions.
5779 2018-08-16 11:42:47 How am I just finding out that coconut oil is the world’s best make up remover?!
5780 2018-08-16 11:42:46 I think pony care parties exist already. A good pony party organiser would cover this also I hope. Chalk painting is not far removed from grooming, plaiting and painting their hooves with hoof oil. Children have been using glitter hoof paint for years with no ill effect.
5781 2018-08-16 11:42:31 I fell iinlove with the way Jaydee pour'd that oil
5782 2018-08-16 11:42:20 No drilling. Go green energy. Fossil fuels are archaic. Move away from pollution. Green energy is the answer. Gas and oil folks are rich enough.

5787 2018-08-16 11:41:35 Just a few months before that he was saying there was loads of oil. I wonder what made Sir Ian change his mind?
5788 2018-08-16 11:41:19 Yes, the lighthouse is another oil painting - inspired by the one on Tybee Island, Georgia. About upstate NY - not as far as Albany... it was near Oswego/Syracuse area. Family in smaller towns in that region. I remember huge snowfalls, one year couldn't open our front door.

5794 2018-08-16 11:39:49 2. If I exclude India's OIL BURDEN then our Improvement of 180bps of Fiscal Deficit from FY15 to FY18 comes to ZERO improvement. 

What is OIL BURDEN ? Revenues which the Govt earns from the sector and population of India !! That burden was 40bps of GDP in 2014 and today 220bps
5795 2018-08-16 11:39:45 Oh....well. My cars been leaking recently so I took it to a local garage for them to have a look, and they said that it looks like the gearbox is leaking, probably needs replacing/taking apart, the powersteering is leaking and the oil filter. Said would cost quite a few hundred £

5798 2018-08-16 11:38:20 Absolutely, using any paints which would cause any harm would be unacceptable. The thing with ponies is that they are groomed, plaited and have their hooves painted with hoof oil, so this is not too far removed from normal equine husbandary and turnout practices...
5799 2018-08-16 11:38:19 "Crude Oil Price Outlook: Slope Broken, Confluent Support Under Siege" Yesterday, WTI crude oil closed below an important slope dating back to last year, a little more weakness will further the notion oil is undergoing a broader trend change.

5826 2018-08-16 11:34:02 Yeah, it is. Just because it happened on Disney property that doesn’t mean that Disney’s at fault. And it was all behind the scenes, it’s not like there’s a huge vat of oil out near the guests.

5862 2018-08-16 11:29:22 You are right, but my point is this administration should have reached out to them in the early days and we would have avoided the total shut down of oil production.

5871 2018-08-16 11:27:57 Have you tried fritters? Grate, salt, let drip for a while in a sieve or cheesecloth, then squish water out. Mix with some beaten egg, seasoning, then cook in a little oil in a pretty hot frying pan.

5881 2018-08-16 11:26:31 The American people are the gas that keeps our country running.  The government is the oil that keeps it running smoothly.  We've been shown the dipstick; it is time to change the oil.  Let's not wait for the check engine light to come on.
5882 2018-08-16 11:25:53 Yeah, cool: but what’s a better resource to deplete. #soil or #oil for food.

Both have a massive #environmental impact.

5893 2018-08-16 11:24:01 Fastest oil change ever.
5894 2018-08-16 11:23:58 Use a spray on oil like olive oil on your bowl
5895 2018-08-16 11:23:29 I really want to buy new clothes or makeup but I spent $80 today on oil paints
5896 2018-08-16 11:23:18 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. 

Yet they are starving due to their socialism.

5903 2018-08-16 11:22:38 I guess. Just because Italian food isn’t big on chilli (which isn’t true, thinking of garlic oil and chilli pasta or pasta all’arrabbiata etc) it doesn’t mean only Mexico uses it 
5904 2018-08-16 11:22:27 Biglang bili sa supermarket kanina, ewan ko bakit ko dinampot yung listerine tas yung facial wash. Planado na coconut oil lang bibilhin ko, sasabihin na naman ni mama pag nakita niya yung mga binili ko na napakaarte ko.

5906 2018-08-16 11:22:25 His last task is destroy Yemen. Win or lose after that, the US and allies start questioning his human rights record. 9/11 resurfaces on a daily basis. Armed opposition starts within Saudi and bang it's all over , except for the oil which keeps on pumping.
5907 2018-08-16 11:22:22 It's amazing what an oil change and clean filters can do. My car is moving.
5908 2018-08-16 11:22:07 Get some education and you will see that you have been victimized by a snake oil salesman/con artist. Trump loves people who are uneducated and gullible.

5921 2018-08-16 11:19:43 For me it was really fun using Google assistant, till i had to bascially sit and look at all my setting and just disable/opt-out of all the data tracking and sharing.

5922 2018-08-16 11:19:26 I see the mountain as high as the sky, from the desert basin. The trail to it’s peek, has ner been tried. I dreamed a way there, on the wings of a dragon. From on his back, the mountain was tiny. His lair I found was barren. Save for a small oil lamp. Now, from inside it I write.

Oil companies DO NOT receive government subsidies! PP DOES! Put aside their evil ways. They take tax money then use it to push politicians who support them

6028 2018-08-16 11:01:03 Saudi Arabia has a stronghold on our schools, colleges, politicians & economy. This is why president Trump wants our country to be energy independent because they are manipulating the world with their oil supply....

6051 2018-08-16 10:56:18 Yes, but what she's saying is that the energy we want for houses/cars/business is going to mine bitcoins/e-money. And THAT is nothing short of stupid. It's just about the same insanity as drilling for oil, lighting the well on fire and just let it burn.

Not the same thing, aioli means "all i oli' that translates into oil and garlic.
In the newest recipes have more ingredients but still not mayo.
6075 2018-08-16 10:53:08 Exactly, oil is in fCt a little higher if I'm not mistaken, but from everything I've seen they've already filled the SPR and product demand hasn't been great
6076 2018-08-16 10:53:03 That is exactly the same tactic the BIR applies in the #SouthernCameroons. Why does French president @EmmanuelMacron still support #PaulBiya? Is France so poor and reluctant to #Ambazonias crude oil and natural gas? @libe @LeMonde_Afrique

6123 2018-08-16 10:46:40 Its how a country manages its resources and priorities. Look at Norway & Venezuela. Both rich in oil. One  is a free market the other is centrally controlled. One has functioning welfare system, the other is a disaster. See the difference?
6124 2018-08-16 10:46:24 OPEC doesn't give a shit about American oil.  We produce so little of it we couldn't control any part of the market with production.  What dropped oil prices was a slowing China and massive investments in natural gas.  OPEC has no control over either of those things.

6173 2018-08-16 10:38:22 Depreciation has only made imported oil more costly in Rupees, not in US Dollars. Now a big rise in dollar-denominated oil prices might result in the kinda oil import cost rise you cite. Either way, the subsequent demand contraction’ll bring the price down sharpish.

6182 2018-08-16 10:37:06 My opinion - 1% or 2% of tax on extracted minerals, oil or gas should be retained 50% by the Shire and 50% by the State its extracted from — some should be accrued and retained for Local Drought - Disaster Relief

6186 2018-08-16 10:36:17 Tax is doing good. Oil component of GDP has reduced. This is good work. However, no govt can achieve so much in 3 years without the foundations of the previous 16 yrs, this is my point. Agricultural success now is premised upon the Agricultural Transformation Agenda of Yar'Adua.

6203 2018-08-16 10:34:14 ice cream made just by milk is extremely rare nowadays, often fats (vegetal or milk) are added even in artisanal ice cream; so I assume they use palm oil as a cheaper alternative - of course good old artisanal ice creams without any added fat were healthier

6233 2018-08-16 10:30:27 What’s wrong with this is that you put it out there as fact. This apocalyptic scene is caused by fires and has 0 to do with oil. Give your head a shake.

6266 2018-08-16 10:23:19 ice cream should be made with milk, not butter. At least butter is closer to milk than it is a vegetable oil! However it's possible that other kind of oils are used for the chocolate/chocolate chips.

6287 2018-08-16 10:20:13 No. A career politician is someone who tries to rise up the ranks. Like Chuka Ummuna. Corbyn was a backbencher and campaigner for 30 years thrust into the limelight. If you want to leech off the state, form an oil company or a private contractor. Mmmm. Taxpayers' money.

6289 2018-08-16 10:19:58 These actions limit supply, driving up prices artificially,.driving down competition artificially. In Standard Oil case, cited in econ classes,.the prices were falling and they just were better at it than everyone. They developed processes and technologies.

6292 2018-08-16 10:19:28 Ethiopia: Coffee, oil seeds, black cardamom...are some of the major export crops of Ethiopia. Regions producing such crops are still suppling their product to market using backward transport system. This may be because of the absence of strong regional planning entities.
6293 2018-08-16 10:19:19 Yes heartii 13hrs daw sya nagstay, tapos matatanggal sya pag mga oil based lang. Dami maganda shade eh. Di ako makatsempo ng happy skin ni Kath eh 
6294 2018-08-16 10:19:18 Not a fan of Maduro, but this could be a game changer if they're actually able to export / trade oil using state governed Petro (PTR)

6318 2018-08-16 10:16:16 The dollar is linked to oil, which is why it's called the petrodollar.  Turkey's is linked to the country and your dumb ass dictator, which is why it's a crashing market.  Turkey doesn't control any part of the world economy lol

6322 2018-08-16 10:15:58 Do you live in a hot place with lots of mosquitoes, if so you could be lowering your testosterone levels whenever you apply repellent or use fumigants. Citronella oil has the same affect but without lowering your #testosterone production

6324 2018-08-16 10:15:43 I learned to cook eggs in a microwave because my aunt was on oxygen. :D We always made sure to use a thick plastic container instead of glass OR use cooking spray on glass ahead of time. Any cooking oil and use your fingers to coat will work fine (peanut is my favorite).
6325 2018-08-16 10:15:42 You're correct about inflation rate in 1983, however, if the military didn't take over, Nigeria would have found it's feet and many projects like Ajaokuta, suspended by Buhari, would have been operational today. We must now make progress quickly before oyr oil becomes worthless

6336 2018-08-16 10:14:15 You are missing the bigger picture. $GWPH is bigger than a company that peddles CBD oil. 
It's like saying $TSLA is a car company.
$TSLA is a solar power company
$GWPH is a wellness company.
But both will take time and patience.

6361 2018-08-16 10:10:55 Lol. You have no idea what your talking about. There is always a way to survive a down turn in oil prices minimizing job loss. NDP blew it big time.

6363 2018-08-16 10:10:47 What they fails to realise was that most of the oil producing countries experienced the same recession but were able to copy becos their government saved during the oil boom.

6374 2018-08-16 10:08:04 Again you're wailing, GEJ depleted the foreign reserves instead of increasing during the oil boom. We were already borrowing to pay salaries as at 2014, so how is it now Buhari's fault?

6423 2018-08-16 09:59:29 The first sensible response to this story. 

It is abhorrent that the many have to pay the price for the actions of the few.

It's all a bit rich considering that our ceaseless wars for oil made it so easy to radicalise and recruit. We created this monster.

6726 2018-08-16 08:59:36 @IndiaRatings has revised down its FY19 economic growth forecast to 7.2% from 7.4% earlier, mainly due to headwinds emanating from elevated global crude oil prices and govt's decision to fix the MSPs of all kharif crops at 1.5x of the prodn cost (A2+FL).  @businessline

6728 2018-08-16 08:58:40 1808228 085838 || ٣٤٥- The oil down the desert way
6729 2018-08-16 08:58:36 We grow and produce about 60% of the food we require a year.
We import 44% gas up 14% since 2014
The balance of oil/gas trade is reasonable but declining.
Steel imports are replacing local production. Energy costs are too high.

We cannot survive without imports.
6730 2018-08-16 08:58:33 my ass up getting a hot oil treatment 
6731 2018-08-16 08:58:31 Sounds like my first car, Holden Torana, 4 cyclinder, went like the clappers down hill, but guzzled oil
6732 2018-08-16 08:58:07 You are funny!!  The only uneducated are those who voted for the Liar in Chief!  He even said it, “I Love the uneducated!” You signed up! . I don’t blame you though, because he is a Snake Oil Salesman! Great at marketing things that are not in your best interest!

6738 2018-08-16 08:56:46 I don't really think Trump is much worse than anybody else, tbh with you. Obama made Bush's tax cuts permanent, he expanded oil drilling in federal waters, bailed out the bankers with no strings attached, droned pol, prosecuted whistleblowers, etc...
6739 2018-08-16 08:56:43 And food was cooked in oil!
6740 2018-08-16 08:56:33 If NDA had oil price bonanza UPA had global boom bonanza. Dont forget the huge eco lift from global boom from 2003 to 2008. That is what pulled up the upa growth averages. Two consecutive droughts, Demo and GST may have pulled down NDA average.

6751 2018-08-16 08:54:14 India buy petroleum products from abroad, and was heavily subsidized by the successive Congress Governments.  The was inevitable to retain power and win votes.  The BJP removed the subsidies.  Even oil producing Saudi Arabia and U.A.E cut subsidies.

6765 2018-08-16 08:50:41 So oil has fallen back in price, quite considerably actually and yet again the price at the pumps has remained the same. We are not very good at keeping petrol companies in check are we.
6766 2018-08-16 08:50:32 could maybe use that oil.......

6768 2018-08-16 08:49:36 That's not really compromising. IN govt and pvt companies buy oil from where ever it suits them best. Reg Chabahar, US isn't bothered about it, that's doomed from the start, unnecessary.

6801 2018-08-16 08:42:15 If you put a little olive oil on the dish before you microwave the eggs on it they shouldn't stick - I do similar when I make crisps (potato chips) in the microwave too and it works like a charm.

6844 2018-08-16 08:33:34 We eat as much unprocessed food as poss. Fats in form of olive oil, avocados, nuts (but no other oils), some butter and cheese. Loads of green veg, eggs & only apples (tart ones) in the fruit area and no beige processed carbs, just small amounts brown rice/pasta
6845 2018-08-16 08:33:03 If you compare white bread recipes from river cottage and delia. River cottage is better recipe, warm water, drier dough, with oil. Delia has a wetter dough and says hand hot water. Wet doughs are horrible for inexperienced cooks, her temps risk a raw in the inside too.

6864 2018-08-16 08:29:52 India's crude oil import from U.S has doubled (compared to last year) and from Iran it's going down fast and by end of the year could reach zero - mostly replaced by U.S and Saudi crude. 

C Asian connectivity is a pointless exercise.
6865 2018-08-16 08:29:21 @NYR_Official Good Morning. Can you tell me if you have any stocks left of your close shave oil. Can't find online anymore. Closest store is Taunton. Thanks

6880 2018-08-16 08:26:34 Thanks for restoring my base and my level! 

All improvements I started yesterday have been aborted. My oil got robbed because I couldn't place blessings and defense troops...

1000 crowns compensation is... ok.
I still feel I lost progress rather than "yeah, crowns!"

6888 2018-08-16 08:24:29 I well remember an oil ''expert'' Captain Nelson Forties. He knew everything about production and exploration. But he got this Co wrong, trusted the Directors too much. I'd dread to add up the BoD remuneration over all those years. Disgraceful. #AEX
6889 2018-08-16 08:23:57 Human made Three-Cheese Pizza on Whole Wheat Crust for dinner, with a green salad (just a splash of oil & vinegar as a dressing). Do you think all that healthy stuff cancels out a slice of gingerbread with apple cider sauce?

6911 2018-08-16 08:17:44 As per 1H18, a relatively stable global economic growth is anticipated, however, over the next six months the US-China trade tension and high oil price are expected to slow global economic growth momentum somewhat.
6912 2018-08-16 08:17:43 It's not safe when ur car is due for servicing.The engine oil loses its quality based on time & usage,only the right quality of fresh oil can prevent ur car engine from wear.

But if u serviced within d last 3 months & u av'nt covered near 100km since,then you can just top it up.
6913 2018-08-16 08:17:43 Hey, those borders represented a perfect balance between the need to give the French something so they don't give us trouble, and the need to have all that lovely oil under Mosul.

Still worked out better than Saudi.

6915 2018-08-16 08:17:05 The oil, Copper and overall raw materials aggressive buying would make for a great deval hedge for China, Is there any data to see what the stores are of all the materials other then oil they have? The oil stores are close to a billy of barrels
6916 2018-08-16 08:16:56 .....But the big lift-sanctions are coming, the Russian Rosneft Oil one. 
Didn’t your how the Russian Media was taking about how the well Helsinke Summet went for Kremlin?  I’m sure Putin knows how to give subtle hints. 
Anyway, looks like we aren’t going to agree so, AuRevoir
6917 2018-08-16 08:16:47 There’s also the issue of oil being extracted, but I honestly doubt that’s going to happen anytime soon, or at all, due to the high costs involved

If Idlib is stalled for now, natural gas/oil reserves will get the focus. And then things can get very quick very badly
6940 2018-08-16 08:10:13 Aw thanks! I’m in the process of growing it out again at the moment so I need to take my own advice  I used to bleach it, dye it red and then dye it back. The oil definitely made a difference. I did what everyone tells you not to do and didn’t get a trim for a year

6946 2018-08-16 08:08:54 Who stock market epp? Convert the stock market index to crude oil prices and the comparison you seek to make will resolve itself . 30% discount in crude presents 30% discount in stock market index not rocket science. While we diversify to unchain our economy from oil-stop wailing
6947 2018-08-16 08:08:27 One of the joys of Greece in the summer is/are the open air cinemas - often showing ‘classics’ during August - this week we’ve seen the 1967 French Classic ‘Le Samurai’; and 1975 ‘Three Days of the Condor’. (Interesting to see USA focus on world control of oil highlighted there).

6968 2018-08-16 08:02:39 The trouble with certified organic or certified palm oil is that by its very nature  its niche & the  slash &burners they have  no morality apart from money  dead from the neck up specialists.there is enough palm oil i dont want to  see another tree organic or otherwise.
6969 2018-08-16 08:02:17 Highlighting a report is hardly bleating, however not everyone works in the oil biz, not everyone has the big salary. To tar all Aberdonians with not giving a hoot is pish, bit like saying all Dundee fans are all egalitarian freedom fighters. which is definitely pish.

7133 2018-08-16 07:27:30 And bridges. And the economy. And... etc How about that fake cold pressed olive oil?  :)

7137 2018-08-16 07:26:24 @gwpurnell @BBCGaryR @BBCDouglasF not before time Sir Ian wheeled out from the past, be dropped as the fount of oil knowledge!
7138 2018-08-16 07:26:09 because the organic doesn't have a stabilizer to keep the oil from separating out
7139 2018-08-16 07:25:58 In Anchorage, we heat with natural gas. In Fairbanks, it's heating oil.
7140 2018-08-16 07:25:55 How can anyone expect 5% growth when the economy was slowing?

We all saw and agree things would have understandably slowed down, which happened to most oil dependent economies.

But a recession?

Nope.

Buhari with his silly policies took a slowdown and made it into a recession.

7143 2018-08-16 07:25:05 Why would a candidate who owns so many oil blocks for his family, and then watch the people who owns the land where the oil is located suffer to death convince you that he cares about you? @atiku, how many times have you or any of your family members driven to any other region?
7144 2018-08-16 07:25:01 It is something do with oil spills

7146 2018-08-16 07:24:41 This is hard to prove. They could slow development to extend their sales of oil reserves which are in serious damage of becoming stranded assets. They have the means and the motive.
7147 2018-08-16 07:24:23 Golly wow, the name Ed Nelson sure sounds Merkin. No equivalence between Skinhead Jones & Musk. Sounds Russian troll, RT, Fox “News” or alt-right RNC which in the sacred name of the United Oil Petrostates = no equivalence.

7152 2018-08-16 07:22:52 Snake oil. Why increase the appeal of this nonsense?

7159 2018-08-16 07:21:33 This is happening as America and it's allies have stop importing crude oil from Iran and rest is ripple effect
7160 2018-08-16 07:21:32 you know those news stories that just fuck with you? the one about the guy at Disney world falling into oil and dying is one of those
7161 2018-08-16 07:21:23 The oil price drop is not the first in recent memory.

Oil price crashed during the 2010 global economic crisis, but Nigeria did not go into recession.

Yes, growth slowed, but we had no recession.

Please what were the reasons back then?
7162 2018-08-16 07:21:11 @pplsummit Just make sure you differentiate Dems from the DNC and DCCC, aka as the party that again covets big oil dollars. Ok?

7207 2018-08-16 07:08:13 That is true until the end of WW2. But after that UK-Saudi relations deteriorated because of the dispute over Saudi Arabia’s southern frontier, which mattered because of the oil concessions that referred to it...

7238 2018-08-16 07:01:32 Significant factor is that oil is traded in US $ and our collapsing currency does not buy many $ these days. Plus the price of oil due to instability in the Middle East is pushing the price up. After Brexit It'll be back to firewood soon for many (including me).

7262 2018-08-16 06:56:52 Aba has been a commercial hub for the south south since I was borne but it has not grown despite its glaring potential. We cannot be talking of growing our non-oil sector if we are projecting to maintain the airport from oil wealth. Strategic projects are for the long term.
7263 2018-08-16 06:56:24 #VerseThatTouchedMe James 5:13-16
Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing Lord. Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord......

7271 2018-08-16 06:54:38 Stepping aside from education today for just a minute to talk about another interesting thing: Oil & Gas. Is there a place where I can read and learn about a roadmap, and how it's going to comprehensively benefit young people, women and the society at large? #ExtractivesInEA

When he wrapped his love all around me
And you don't know the cost of the oil in my Alabaster Box!!!

7284 2018-08-16 06:50:56 Let's see. Seven people in a car, and let's guess 10,000 people use the buses for each game. That means the tunnel would need 1,428 cars each way. That seems totally doable. Musk needs to go back to selling boy's bands, monorails, and snake oil.

7286 2018-08-16 06:50:52 Fitch revised down its FY19 economic growth forecast to 7.2% from 7.4% earlier. The key reason is the headwinds emanating from the (i) elevated global crude oil prices and (ii) government’s decision to fix the minimum support prices of all kharif crops at 1.5x of production cost

7290 2018-08-16 06:49:55 Energy East was never intended to supply Canadian refineries. Oil producers face an over-supplied NA market. They don't want to supply discounted oil to Canadian refineries, they want to export Canadian oil to remedy the discount.

7295 2018-08-16 06:48:42 I tried Aunt Jackie's products for Nana's hair and I didn't like how they left her hair looking and feeling. So I'm sticking to coconut oil and these shampoos we've been using. They're treating her hair well.

7297 2018-08-16 06:48:37 It's almost 3am EST and I can't sleep.  I asked Google home to play rain sounds.  While it's suppose to sound soothing it sounds like deep fry oil in action.

7329 2018-08-16 06:42:50 Labor is a commodity. Just oil or food or whatever. Now if you have too much the price ( wages) go down. If you have a high demand the price (wages) go up. So if you dont flood the market with cheap labor then wages for poor and middle class go up. #basiceconomics

1.MACRRO INDICATORS-crude oil falling and weak currency.
2.OPTION CHAIN ANALYSIS-maximum open interest at 1300,fresh longs were made
3.TECHNICAL INDICATOR-heikin ashi, MACD/ADX.
7336 2018-08-16 06:41:53 What this article does is to shoot down the idea that oil companies get special treatment when it comes to “subsidies“ they get the same breaks that other sectors do. I believe the answer for GW will come from the private sector through R&D, not from gov’s adding a carbon tax
7337 2018-08-16 06:41:31 The NHS need to be honest and say that they are no longer removing ear wax and that you need to put oil in your ears for a week or two and then find a private clinic and it will cost at least £35 an ear. Don't add a DIY kit before you start.

7353 2018-08-16 06:38:29 For those who followed my ear wax saga what really annoys me is the surgery telling me that I can do it myself a bit of oil & squirting water with a bulb - when it took an experienced expert 30mins with micro-suction and irrigation. I had to pay more than £9 for the kit!

7371 2018-08-16 06:34:24 Socialism is the control by the government of some means of production; steel, oil, police, taxing, farming, etc. much of Europe has socialism in many other institutions.

7373 2018-08-16 06:33:56 Great article, but the ending left me wondering if this “great & wonderful plan for all Canadians” is a lie when soon our expenditures to fight climate change & fortify dikes, etc, will outstrip all global oil & gas & green subsidies combined! There’s a better plan out there.
7374 2018-08-16 06:33:52 So it's all about oil and money.

7391 2018-08-16 06:31:24 It definitely works for pain in cancer but the pure cannabis oil which isn't yet available legally here is what has been proven in some to 'cure' cancer & numerous studies that it helps chronic pain, anxiety,sleep etc. Definitely must do something.

7444 2018-08-16 06:19:54 There is nothing elusive about renewables. #SolarEnergy is incredibly efficient. All we lack is the political will to deficit spend and rapidly transition to these better forms of energy. It's entirely possible to leave the oil in the ground w a healthy econ in the long-term.

A 150cc bike does not give mileage like 100cc bike so not convenient for short distance use, uses too much fuel, more pollution, increased oil use. Yet people use 150cc or even 350cc for short distance use.

7765 2018-08-16 05:18:45 Rupee was 69 in 2013 against US Dollar. If it had held it's ground even after five years despite volatile oil prices and US & China trade war, it's due to the strong Indian economy & it's able management madame. You should consult Mr Amit Mitra to understand it.

7778 2018-08-16 05:16:15 Yes it is clearly socialisms fault in a country where the vast majority of industry is private. Clearly the problem isn't oil pricing like we see in Russia or political corruption, it is socialism. Take that Bernie.
7779 2018-08-16 05:16:04 If I'm not mistaken, unless you count organizations purely funded by the government, the oil industry is the most subsidized industry in the world. Yet you hear people talking about how EVs are "over" subsidized and how it creates an unfair imbalance in the economy.

7817 2018-08-16 05:09:28 Also don't google Costco fish. In CA we have things like avocado oil, olive oil from Napa, growlers of kombucha and pressed juices at the Costco, if you have those things I recommend because they're bargainy. Good luck! (the hotdogs are good but you will burp fire for a year)
7818 2018-08-16 05:09:18 Seems unfair BC won't let our oil pass through and they send us all this.

7855 2018-08-16 05:03:11 You are partially correct. CO has more oil and gas production than statewide demand, so we do ship our excess to neighboring states that don’t have the adequate energy resources to meet their own demand.

8026 2018-08-16 04:32:07 A stove is a device used for cooking. You put pots and pans on it. The stove heats up and it warms the pan/pot and whatever is in said item. It runs on electricity or oil. It is found in the kitchen. Sometimes an oven will be under it. A microwave can also be over it.

8031 2018-08-16 04:31:09 But you do not think that the Iran sanctions, falling Venezuela production, non-Opec disappointing will be more than enough to offset this latest Opec surge ? And while we have trade wars oil demand still grows (maybe at a slower pace).
8032 2018-08-16 04:31:03 yes...I've been to many when married to a Catholic with a huge Catholic family . Never understood a word they were saying ...just stared in amazement at their outfits and religious paraphernalia ...smoke, oil  and stuff.

8040 2018-08-16 04:30:10 All kinds of new tech will likely change this. And have you seen what oil extraction does in places like ND and Nigeria? The net effect on environment of solar, wind,.storage taking over will be way less worse than coal, oil , gas they'll replace. Far from perfect but far better
8041 2018-08-16 04:30:08 So you want a 20% cut. I'm glad changing the minister fleet vehicles will do that for us. Will you remove oil subsidies along with green subsidies? 

Are you going to be reducing our revenue by bringing back the flat tax? BC has an HST, will you be implementing one?

8085 2018-08-16 04:23:38 Also mixing tea tree oil in with a perfume free body lotion will help soothe + break down any inflammation, Epsom salt baths and adding turmeric into any foods will help internally with any inflammation and help any work you do do, hold!
8086 2018-08-16 04:23:29 What I'm saying , most of  the stocks arent going up. Even some of the big names pausing or coming back down. Most of this sector should be going through the roof. If this was oil or lithium or zinc with a 26% move in the commodity,  they would be gone

8090 2018-08-16 04:23:15 Turkey should never have been allowed into NATO. Fundamental differences between aims of Europe and those of a Dictator Erdogan. Not least his shady oil deals with ISIS, and also his wish to enslave the Kurds. Imho.
8091 2018-08-16 04:22:57 I do it! It only blurs depending on how oil your skin is and if it’s done with the stokes too close together. It last 1-2 years and most people numb through out the process. You see the final results after the 6 week touch up.

8211 2018-08-16 04:04:39 And I know that similar worries for Standard Oil we're brought about, and by the time the anti trust suits finished they didn't matter.

8213 2018-08-16 04:04:34 We have to stop focusing JUST on the now and making short-sighted decisions. We have to be looking at the short and long game. Opening up oil sites will be great in short term and disastrous in the long term

8236 2018-08-16 04:00:35 空所を埋めよ。 There ( 1 ) ( 2 ) a number of layoffs in the oil company recently.
最近石油会社で大きな一時解雇があった。
 【答え】　(1. have ) (2. been )
8237 2018-08-16 04:00:26 Was about to feel bad for Real Madrid...

Then I remembered that they sold the "oil of gladness, Ororo, Naaah 
8238 2018-08-16 04:00:20 I Bought This Expensive Ass Body Oil Last Week Just for It to Come Up Missing This Week 
8239 2018-08-16 04:00:13 自分は90行かないくらいだった気がする(気がする)
8240 2018-08-16 04:00:02 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
8241 2018-08-16 04:00:01 Pasta of the Day: Greek God - pasta with olive oil, garlic and melted feta cheese (sliced tomatoes optional)
8242 2018-08-16 03:59:50 1. Exfoliate 

I just mix 2 parts white cane sugar with 1 part olive oil and store it in a mason jar for further uses because I made a big batch 
8243 2018-08-16 03:59:40 Use with carrier oil like Olive oil at first for frankincense.
8244 2018-08-16 03:59:37 My twin have been going to the doctors for at least 5 years, each time we go they give us, a different result, right now my twin is on a diet with the added bonus of no vegetable oil
8245 2018-08-16 03:59:32 そういう意味では？？隙間はありますけど(？)
8246 2018-08-16 03:59:26 Couldn’t have said it better! It has always been socialism, the difference was how much money was coming in from oil sales and from leveraging the country by issuing debt.
8247 2018-08-16 03:59:09 ไว้รอของมาก่อนนะคะ
8248 2018-08-16 03:59:02 เกมส์วันนี้ พยายามจะกดกลุ่ม ptt +scc+ivl ผลจาก Oil ลงเมื่อคืน  แต่อีกขา ก็ไปซื้อแบงค์กับสื่อสารขัดกันไว้
8249 2018-08-16 03:59:00 初だとちょっと上のところから始まってしまうので、それが普通なのです。
落ち着けば自分のランクと同じ人としか当たらないからノーマルよりバランス良くなるよ

8251 2018-08-16 03:58:52 An easy one we do is chickpea tacos. Sauté canned chickpeas in olive oil and add taco seasoning. Making the shells however you like, but smear smashed avocado or guac on the inside. Top with whatever toppings you like. Hella quick and easy to make.
8252 2018-08-16 03:58:31 ได้ค่าแอด ขอบคุณมากนะคะ
8253 2018-08-16 03:58:24 でも チン があるから結局穴は一つか
8254 2018-08-16 03:58:21 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,
because once Kyu incorrectly entered oil when
cooking a simple ham.
8255 2018-08-16 03:58:20 I would not buy snake oil in the first place. Please don't make me have to explain similes to you.
8256 2018-08-16 03:58:09 And for cars, there are different technologies. While you are sitting there saying "No good. Everything bad but oil because that's what I've been told" people are actually doing something. You are as backwards as technologically-inept Trump.

8258 2018-08-16 03:57:55 Thank you Kristina. Please expose this rancid deal for what it is. A cash splash to mates to keep the reef off the UNESCO Watch List so big oil can keep polluting. How low can the LNP go?

8269 2018-08-16 03:56:20 I use Korres they sale it at Sephora it’s helped a lot! And changing your pillow cases often because they hold oil
8270 2018-08-16 03:56:13 But we must get that oil flowing! Climate change isn’t real. Droughts aren’t real. Forests set ablaze by lightning caused or intensified by climate change isn’t real. What’s real? Money!

8273 2018-08-16 03:55:54 A risk assessment is a decision making tool. If someone’s selling you a color coded list of vulnerabilities, it’s snake oil. Big 4 firms are notorious for this.
8274 2018-08-16 03:55:43 When they say the body responds to stimuli differently and she hears ur an oil worker....her body starts responding in different formats #alingo #shakushaku #gwaragwara #antenna all activated at once..

8276 2018-08-16 03:55:12 I still have two of them.  Excellent machines with a few common part faults, but everyone has inventory. Throat is small for heavy canola and the tires are expensive.  The oil pressure switch on the Cummins should have been recalled.  If it's original get a new MCD30214 now.

8282 2018-08-16 03:54:41 Well, we know who Trudeau allows Can to pay ~$US4.3M/day for oil to and who he sells LAVs to, so I guess Baird is on the side of terrorists and dictators too.  Surprising for sure.
8283 2018-08-16 03:54:37 I would have never even guessed olive oil!
8284 2018-08-16 03:54:36 Gawd damn, you have to wear a damn space suit to cook anything with oil

8290 2018-08-16 03:54:04 I recently treated a horse for cancer .( by giving the horse a bail of bud trim / leaves to eat ..  As well as a topical oil to be put directly on the cancer tumors ...  It worked !!!  The horse is doing well now ( and was not expected to survive ) ..  I also treat dogs & cats :)
8291 2018-08-16 03:54:03 Buildings like Jefferson HS would never be allowed in high income areas. Unfortunately it’s the squeaky wheels (vocal parents) that get the oil. It’s inequity at its finest.

8305 2018-08-16 03:52:43 @EWKWA I was looking at cbd oil today. Being a conservative state, I can choose between thc-free or the regular hemp version, where there is only .3% thc, at most.

From what you have seen in cbd-thc oils, what is the thc levels in a more permissive state?

8359 2018-08-16 03:46:55 Climate change is happening, and there is evidence all around us. Glaciers melting, record rainfalls, ridiculous forest fires.

Oil is an old technology. It would be prudent to invest in something more future-proof, sustainable and something that respects nature as it should be.
8360 2018-08-16 03:46:49 Chef Louis cut up some carrots, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was veal, along with Silly Putty.

8367 2018-08-16 03:46:01 1) I don't think the rest of Canada wants to be dependant on or beholden to Alberta or the oil industry. 2) It's likely not good to have your currency or economy tied to one particular resource, especially if the world is looking at other options.

8371 2018-08-16 03:45:30 As I said they can travel with or without travel ban. Yes with travel ban will be a little bit hard but money and oil can handle that. It's important to understand that Trump don't do things that don't work.
8372 2018-08-16 03:45:25 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor. Snake oil sellers don't last, but we've got lots. Nepal needs #education to rid of this pests & #soonWewill together
8373 2018-08-16 03:45:13 I love using fresh pineapple. Once on a pan you put like a teaspoon of oil heated pan and cook the sausages especially hot and spicy ones or both. Take them out of the pan don't put oil nothing in the pan just fresh sliced pineapples and saute on both sides. Amazing
8374 2018-08-16 03:45:10 insult humor is quackery. it's a snake oil. it isn't funny - it's a shortcut and it's an offensive one to anyone with a brain. Don Rickles wasn't funny - he was an asshole. Frankly I'm pretty tired of hack comedians trying to tell me what's funny.

8377 2018-08-16 03:44:57 And we as individuals must take responsibility for paying attention to and reducing our carbon footprint in the ways we can. Waiting for “leaders” to figure it out is an easy excuse for benefitting from coal and oil and making it “someone else’s” responsibility. We can do better.
8378 2018-08-16 03:44:44 Right on, man. Don’t ever let some sandle-wearing hipster writing ebooks tell you that working hard in necessary job is something to be ashamed of. Those guys would be nowhere without gas in their cars (oil), cops on the beat, mechanics under the hood...etc.
8379 2018-08-16 03:44:43 I think it’s bc you live in CA! Everything is expensive out there! Lmao $200 for an oil change is crazyyyy! Mine is normally $40-45  I swear they use gold instead of oil.
8380 2018-08-16 03:44:38 Ice cream at 11pm? Yikes!

Spike was on upper deck listening to @RedSox on radio with a couple Icehouse oil cans, that was pretty fine.

8383 2018-08-16 03:43:59 Hey @FresnoBee take a look at Nunes friends at Akin Gump donation of $500k. They handled the deal to buy Energen Corp, they do gas & oil exploration. So Azerbaijan's exports are gas & oil. So what was Devin doing in that garden spot, vacation? FEC website Investigate.
8384 2018-08-16 03:43:49 Things are in motion. Also, I have been enjoying benne oil, green peanut oil, and okra seed oil lately, but just as finishing oils.

8386 2018-08-16 03:43:40 Wow , you are very poetic with your lingo. Do you really think it wise to bad mouth an Albertan.... Considering Alberta keeps all of Canada secure with oil and paying out massive transfer payments to Quebec. Show the gratitude.

8392 2018-08-16 03:42:57 This argument implies that in order to have a cautious view on climate change, one must live in a hut w/o heat, ride a bike or walk, wear only animal hide, and cook over wood burning fire.  Ironically, if the above standard were to be enforced then the oil industry would collapse
8393 2018-08-16 03:42:42 That can't be a REAL Trumpet. There's no oil drippings underneath it.

8409 2018-08-16 03:41:30 After BC ferries, bulk of fuel and oil spills are during unloading at small FN coastal villages. Therefore all fossil fuel transport to these villages must be halted. They did just fine for 12,000 yrs without it.

8457 2018-08-16 03:33:16 Well without him we'd be a country that begins somewhere at the Manitoba-Ontario border that probably goes throughout the east. Buying American oil and being treated like we were Alaska. So shame on #Victoria

8517 2018-08-16 03:24:52 Heard of "peak oil"? If crude oil were a renewable resource, there wouldn't be ever increasing prices and consequent ever-increasing incentive to exploit increasingly expensive and environmentally damaging low-grade expensive oil souces such as shale.
8518 2018-08-16 03:24:41 Olive oil? Wanna know a little fact about it? Back in the day in Australia we only used it as medicine & when the Italians came & migrated here they taught us how to use it for cooking 
8519 2018-08-16 03:24:31 Agreed Ben! Divest from dirty coal&oil to invest in cleaner alternatives. Incentivise the consumer transition&subsidize the grid conversion. We can solve the energy aspects of pollution in short order but still thats just 1 part of the grand problem of climate change on the whole

8536 2018-08-16 03:20:29 Love this. Terrible and toxic pollution and yet he selectively disregards oil and pipelines.
8537 2018-08-16 03:20:29 after careful consideration (and also paying $80 for an oil change and tire rotation) i have decided that adulthood is not for me and i will be returning to age 10 at my next birthday you’re all invited to the party there will be sheet cake and a magician
8538 2018-08-16 03:20:28 Oil prices on Thursday recouped some of the previous day's losses after Beijing said it would send a delegation to Washington in an attempt to resolve trade disputes between the United States and China that have roiled global markets.

8543 2018-08-16 03:20:01 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
8544 2018-08-16 03:19:36 You’d be dazzled by how many people attribute the Venezuelan collapse to falling oil prices in 2014.
We Venezuelans have failed to make this point beyond obvious.

8558 2018-08-16 03:17:22 You live in a nation that steal money from the people. You're the only nation with oil who can't turn into energy to have power 24 hours. Your whole country is corrupt & you talking about black folks over here? But I guess I'm on the plantation!
8559 2018-08-16 03:17:16 Yeah and the hot cinammon oreos had the flavor of cinammon oil as opposed to bark, but not enough to qualify as Hot. Even my wife loved 'em.
8560 2018-08-16 03:17:11 Obama never went over 3%.. and when he got to 3% it was due to the oil industry he campaigned against.. it went to 3% in spite of him, not because of him.!!
8561 2018-08-16 03:17:08 2 tablespoon of olive oil every morning + high fiber wheat raisin loaf = Good health
8562 2018-08-16 03:17:06 So I’m trying tea tree oil for my face and it literally smells so bad my eyes won’t stop tearing

8573 2018-08-16 03:15:29 Humans need to be working diligently to move away from fossil fuels. Big Oil keeps the lid on research, development & production of better alternatives. We need to keep bringing pressure to bear on oil tycoons. Hybrids are a step in the right direction.

8577 2018-08-16 03:14:59 Per well, water use intensity was greater than the increase in oil and gas production, although oil production had a greater water/unit ratio as compared to shale gas.
8578 2018-08-16 03:14:53 Which ones? Oil names ?

8597 2018-08-16 03:11:08 You like to know about old men falling into a vat of oil and dying... right... you're sick in the head.
8598 2018-08-16 03:10:52 Oh I see our ministers need psychic powers to be able to guess what other countries are going to do. I would gladly pay more at the pump and not buy their oil.

8606 2018-08-16 03:10:19 pretty sure I have the malocchio on me but also I can’t do the test because my brother says using this can of Coles canola oil spray instead of olive oil will only curse me further

8624 2018-08-16 03:08:12 Kat Watsons aja Zaim. And they have orhers with tea tree oil and argan oil too. But so far best pakai because it’s not oily or drying like liquid makeup removers.

8632 2018-08-16 03:06:58 WOW   ty for post.  Me and my entire family 4 households use Dawn dish soap, will be looking for new brand.  I supported them because they the oil cleanups.  But to support that vulgar one sided rapid Ingraham with her racist talk., No way.  Not getting my dime. #dawndish
8633 2018-08-16 03:06:57 First, you oil your vat up. Next, you fall right in. That’s what I call, the Sticky Mickey.
8634 2018-08-16 03:06:57 Haven't looked, but my thought would be no. Glyphosate shouldn't be used near eggs, and it's hydrophilic so I doubt it would end up in eggs or oil. Vinegar... maybe? But the levels would be low if it's there at all. And I don't think glyphosate causes cancer in any case.

Within seconds there was fine powder & a mist of chili oil, then it ignited, the lid exploded upwards & we were forced to de-arse the area through acrid pepper clouds

#lessonlearned
8664 2018-08-16 03:01:36 Cool. So we don’t import ME oil anymore?  I missed that announcement.
8665 2018-08-16 03:01:28 Generally yes. Some people do a rule of 4x as a rough calculation. There are exceptions and certain ingredients cost more then others. And as an owner you try to balance it out. We’re not greedy. We’re small. Ask @RachelNotley to lower small biz tax to the same as her oil buddies
8666 2018-08-16 03:01:20 I like meat, too, but this is one of my favorite meals.

Arrange red and yellow heirloom tomato slices on a dinner plate

Slather on burrata

Chiffonade fresh basil,  sprinkle on top

Drizzle high quality olive oil over all

Season w/sea salt and fresh ground pepper 

Yum!

8674 2018-08-16 03:00:24 Italy also had 20%+ inflation in 1970s during oil crisis and I think some stuff went down in between 1920-1945, not sure..

8677 2018-08-16 03:00:14 Surely you don't really think oil prices and gas prices are related.  When the oil companies get hurt by unexpected lower prices, the price stays high to compensate for their loses.  It's only when the oil prices drop due to an intended surplus do gas prices decline. 
8678 2018-08-16 03:00:06 I prefer sugar to olive oil.
8679 2018-08-16 02:59:56 Protect: You need to provide loving leadership that guides and protects with dignity and love.

8680 2018-08-16 02:59:49 I’m using that article, and the one related to oil, as a forecast for exactly how the rest of the tariff hikes they have/might try will go. It will repeat itself. Again, we have it, they need it. They aren’t going to stop needing things.

8685 2018-08-16 02:59:12 Charley called the prospect of a new private prison "snake oil". Made me cringe after learning the history of the phrase.
8686 2018-08-16 02:59:07 I can't see them playing heavy metal on the stage. Nor commercial diver on oil rigs in the gulf. Repairing ships in the Bearing Sea. Charged by a coastal Alaskan grizzley bear and survive. Working at all for sh!t. Worthless.
8687 2018-08-16 02:59:04 Ive gone 23 years without peppermint oil. I’d hardly classify that as essential.
8688 2018-08-16 02:59:00 In a capitalist system like Nigeria, only the NNPC solely in charge of oil business.
8689 2018-08-16 02:58:52 We called it Indian oil
8690 2018-08-16 02:58:17 Got a oil change and Isis ridin a lil smoother
8691 2018-08-16 02:58:11 No, he was one that stood in the way of oil exploration and distribution in the United States SO THAT we would be dependent on Middle East oil!!

Look it up! We are NO LONGER dependent because of @realDonaldTrump !!
8692 2018-08-16 02:58:01 Did he actually drown in it? Or was it a vat of hot oil and he fried himself to death? I can't imagine how either feels, but I assume they're both terrible. Poor guy.
8693 2018-08-16 02:57:57 I had to do the same with my hairless guinea pigs I used to have. They needed regular coconut oil rub downs and bathing semi regularly

8695 2018-08-16 02:57:53 So there's no sure shot way to say whether rupee value will actually appreciate/depreciate but one thing sure to happen due to fall in oil prices is:We'll have huge foreign exchange reserves. So BOP situation will change for better.We'll hav more resources for developing our SOC!

8707 2018-08-16 02:56:31 Theoretically -ve oil prices shocks are expected to shift wealth from exporters to importers. Primarily we're importer, so a fall in oil prices is supposed to appreciate rupee value. But practically the relationship b/w oil price movement and exchange rate regime is a loose one!

8715 2018-08-16 02:55:53 No. It was... I can't even remember the name. It was on YouTube and a very small fox wannabe cable channel.  Funded by some Texas oil guy.  I don't want to name my friend who hosted. It was terrible.

8717 2018-08-16 02:55:49 Uhm, exported to other countries so their people can eat, or to feed animals that their people can eat. Corn is food or feed in many countries,  sunflowers are used mainly for their oil or byproduct,  some for bird seed if not good enough oil content. Need to work on you facts.
8718 2018-08-16 02:55:47 Tesla is the biggest and most celebrated threat to the oil industry. Imagine if most cars were electric. The oil industry would loose much of their business. Of course Saudi would be interested in purchasing Tesla. #notyourfriends

8725 2018-08-16 02:54:51 The *downside?*

The world uses 80-million+ barrels of oil a day.

A 5% drop in the global economy cuts demand by 4-million+ barrels a day.

A 10% drop cuts demands by 8-million+ barrels a day.

Remember how tough it was for Russia/OPEC to cut production by 1.7 million/day.

8808 2018-08-16 02:43:28 Out our tail pipe. We should use the advancements with oil & gas to build smarter products that lower costs significantly to harness energy from the sun, wind, rivers & sea.

8822 2018-08-16 02:42:09 My personal brand is getting burned by hot oil when I put the meat in the skillet. Such a dumbass.
8823 2018-08-16 02:41:54 nah i can guarantee it wont. that area is chock full of little untended oil wells that go deep into the groud. it will never pass the environmental impact review
8824 2018-08-16 02:41:49 Then they aren’t organic. You are a good little right wing soldier  keeping up the talking point of hypocrisy when all the GOP wants is put money in their oil donors hands. Yeah, just sit back and criticize and do nothing because that’s all you have to offer.

8827 2018-08-16 02:41:29 I know you’re not used to seeing the hands of a working man, but there you have it. It’s called oil and dirt, from working for a living.  You dems want socialism but expect manicured hands.  Who’s gonna pay for all the free crap you Democrats want to shower upon everyone? #MAGA

8830 2018-08-16 02:41:19 Deep cleansing kaolin clay and peppermint oil to the rescue!  How are you finding the minty kick from this skin treat?
8831 2018-08-16 02:41:17 Anyone who professes that Sandy Hook was staged, should not be able to sell their snake oil anywhere.  Alex Jones is a conspiracy creating nut job.
8832 2018-08-16 02:40:55 Yep, I think Saudi's see the global potential with Europe/China funding for Tesla factories.  Will give them a lot of exposure worldwide to hedges against oil. $TSLA 

People don't get the Saudis are investing in the future. They have enough revenue from oil now.

8835 2018-08-16 02:40:47 Spray dry shampoo in your roots! Especially wherever your head hits the pillow...it will absorb oil while you sleep!
8836 2018-08-16 02:40:37 This Omarosa distraction is pure torture.  I suggest we put her and Donnie in a ring and let them duke it out wearing diapers while covered in oil.  
Nothing would be too humiliating for these 2.

8843 2018-08-16 02:40:06 after they redid the local Chevy dealership, I was in the waiting area while my Malibu's oil got changed and noticed the piped in music was all songs that referenced cars, especially GM brands (like "Little Red Corvette")
8844 2018-08-16 02:39:56 24 thousand dollars for an oil change 
8845 2018-08-16 02:39:21 Oh, Chuckles the Clown.
At this point, your career defines embarrassment. 
Just shut up.
I was for this before I was against it, after I was against before I was for it, and what was my position?
You are a snake oil loser who only cares about keeping yourself in power.
8846 2018-08-16 02:39:13 But you are right - we have to stop buying their oil.
8847 2018-08-16 02:38:30 No i use this oil i bought online , lol
8848 2018-08-16 02:38:28 What does the oil represent?

8851 2018-08-16 02:38:08 Colorado values clear skies, clean air, fresh water, and the health and safety of its residents. Oil&Gas overreach, voracious appetite for profit, and disregard for the cumulative impact is unconscionable. The industry impaled on its own sword. #SaferSetbacks
8852 2018-08-16 02:38:05 Lavender oil helps the itching. Get some for the future.
8853 2018-08-16 02:38:02 How bout the US stops displaying PC bullshit and just take Afghan for, not only the oil, but the foot-hold that it is.
8854 2018-08-16 02:37:59 Mustard, ranch, tzatziki, pesto, oil+vinegar, that good peppercorn parmesan stuff, some of those fancy aiolis that aren't just straight up mayo?
8855 2018-08-16 02:37:16 Going by how much oil we produce, 1980s were great. Now we are back to those levels. Therefore, we are great again.

8862 2018-08-16 02:36:08 Ownership of the Standard leads back to one Philip Anschutz, whose family made its billions in oil wildcatting.

8864 2018-08-16 02:35:35 Yep, my point is that, pace your previous comment, Norway was not unusual in Europe up until the '70s/'80s, and the key thing that differentiated it after that was the massive abundance of oil revenues
8865 2018-08-16 02:35:33 Got the old boat motor back together. Just need to add gear oil and fire it up so I can sell it. Cleaned up the garage a bit. Was gonna do the radiator in the XT but meh. Need to save my energy for the next couple days at work by myself.

8869 2018-08-16 02:35:09 #wipworldbuilders 15 The servants brought steaming platters of grilled fish, vegetables and rice, lamb skewers and roasted quail in a salty broth; bread and dipping oil, pungent salads, figs, olives and cheese. The wine was served liberally and no one lacked anything.

8872 2018-08-16 02:33:40 XELZAAR(1995): Greg recalled the merc saying 'especially her' & he began to dwell on it. What were they going to do to her? Were they going to rape her or sell her off as a sex slave to some Arab oil tycoon? Especially-what on earth did that mean? He could never let that happen.
8873 2018-08-16 02:33:28 We need another #cashforclunkers to get oil burners off the roads.
8874 2018-08-16 02:33:14 I might be smoking synthetic oil cause I’ve been acting very strange since I started using it
8875 2018-08-16 02:32:34 I’m so mad I just spilled a jar of coconut oil all over the floor and then fell hard trying to clean up the mess. Like why me 
8876 2018-08-16 02:32:23 I just can't go along with this at all.

I mean, yeah, the squirrels take the black oil seeds i leave for the birds, but the chipmunks do too and the dog likes to watch them.

8884 2018-08-16 02:31:05 They've been using oil revenues for longer than the SWF has been around, surely.  And in 1980, for example, Norway and the UK had similar levels of public wealth (29.5% to 27.0% respectively)
8885 2018-08-16 02:30:59 His speech has consequences others have committed crimes because of his negligence. People believe that this man is giving them real news and truth to conspiracies. He sells POISON lead filled supplements. People buy his snake oil unknowingly and that’s a crime.

8893 2018-08-16 02:29:47 I asked to connect with an individual who does veterinary research on dogs and seizures IN THE CONTEXT OF ALSO FINDING PEOPLE INTERESTED IN BIOMETRIC SENSORS. How the fuck is “have you tried CBD oil” any of that? Gtfo
8894 2018-08-16 02:29:38 Wait do you have oil
8895 2018-08-16 02:29:36 Also I’m watching some shit on Netflix about Canadians stealing maple syrup cuz it’s more expensive than oil. THE FUCK ARE YOU ALL DOING??
8896 2018-08-16 02:29:35 Yummy. Please share recipe. What kind of pot are you using? Is that vegetable oil or canola?
8897 2018-08-16 02:29:28 True talk, the world might be angry because foreign banks are suffering, foreign traders are not happy, property owners abroad are not happy, multi-national companies can no more evade tax and steal our crude oil

8900 2018-08-16 02:28:55 PMO is posting in Hindi???? Can't you guys create a separate account for Hindi posts. I don't think so you are doing anything productive in office. 1 US$ is 70 Rs. Oil price in world is stable but Indian market oil price is increasing, GST benefits not reached the common people.?

8902 2018-08-16 02:28:54 Why does Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Quebec have hydraulic fracturing bans. Quebec has its own oil and gas.

8907 2018-08-16 02:28:19 @Sephora Is there any way to request that I don't get things I'm incredibly allergic to in my Play Box? I'm very allergic to argan and marula oils (they're tree nuts!) and I got Moroccan Oil texture spray in my box that I cannot use. Thanks!
8908 2018-08-16 02:28:12 My cat is obsessed with coconut oil and idk how to handle it. Do I let him? Do I stop him? Help
8909 2018-08-16 02:28:04 Oh noo! that just means i've been slacking off :l an oil change and ac fix is like the least i can do especially after making so much fantastic and delicious food!!
8910 2018-08-16 02:28:04 I'd rather paint them in oil, or acrylic, or even water colors.
8911 2018-08-16 02:27:54 If you wear makeup regularly it could be a clogged oil duct! Get a gentle facial cleanser and gently massage in circles a few times each day and it should go away(the way to know is if it's sore in the inner or outer corner of your eye) hope that helps! Seeya at afest <3
8912 2018-08-16 02:27:54 Vegetable oil
8913 2018-08-16 02:27:40 It wasn't an oil painting, but when you win by 5 runs in New York, it's a good night.  We'll discuss the latest #Rays win with calls at 888-546-4620, tweets and emails on the postgame show.
8914 2018-08-16 02:27:30 Hot, oil, guns. 
8915 2018-08-16 02:27:29 This call is for the status quo. I've learned a long time ago that fundamentals don't always matter. Fear & speculation are much bigger drivers. Q4 is a long time from now, could see sub 6O before that and I don't think we see a oil deficit if we get a global slowdown.
8916 2018-08-16 02:27:27 Girl i let my oil go -1200 miles  and now it sounds like shit and so now my mom say check it now 
8917 2018-08-16 02:27:16 Sea salt. I love how it is now. That flax oil suggestion is GREAT.

We love our skillet so much.
8918 2018-08-16 02:26:52 There's a huge HUGE market for hemp based CBD oil right now. I've read a ton of conflicting info on hemp vs cannabis derrived CBD oil. One is legal in Canada (hemp based), one will be soon (cannabis based)

Just wondering what you're using as I've seen accounts of both.
8919 2018-08-16 02:26:48 I might be off of Henley this week, my early looks are not promising. Ill be burning midnight oil though
8920 2018-08-16 02:26:41 I have been bathing in shea butter and laveldar oil baths because looks like I'm a candidate for Patient 0. I'm using QV flare up cream as a night treatment which is keeping my face calmer than it probably is.

8925 2018-08-16 02:26:02 Girl. I realized that oil paintings are something I’m going to only do in between other pieces. Cause I’m impatient.
8926 2018-08-16 02:25:55 Its astounding really. When I look at how hard they fight against our Oil and Gas and other energy sources I can't help but feel they are coming from a bigoted attitude. The energy sector should be able to be fully inclusive of all energy forms because all of them are our future.
8927 2018-08-16 02:25:17 I make the Holy oil with CBD rich hemp buds and another batch with Indica THC buds. Two kinds. They work on some different problems but both contain many of the same extracts and heal very well. The Indica Holy oil helps with sleep disorders and should be taken at bedtime.

8945 2018-08-16 02:23:10 There are people who are actually dying for their convictions as they try to bring truth forward.

I sit here afraid to say or do anything, while the powers that be spray our skies, dump oil and radioactive material into our water, and geo-manufacture our food. We are helpless...
8946 2018-08-16 02:23:05 So basically Denmark isn’t really socialist, just a European welfare state with oil.
8947 2018-08-16 02:22:58 I HATE that. I’ve started like 3 oil paintings just because I hate waiting for one to dry with nothing else to do 
8948 2018-08-16 02:22:55 Hello economist, you got any idea abt the correlation between crude oil price and usd-inr exchange rate? Our prime moron managed to make the rupee value fall, even when the crudeoil price came down significantly.
8949 2018-08-16 02:22:46 Leftists = The same people who demand the halt of oil drilling and also complain about the price of petrol. 
8950 2018-08-16 02:22:44 Sometimes you just have to treat yourself. After submitting my Fulbright app, i took a 45 min shower with a coconut treatment for my hair, hot oil treatment for body and did my laser treatment for my face. #treatyoself

8955 2018-08-16 02:21:50 Then at least just “equalize” tax subsidies on oil & gas exploration with all other renewables. Level the playing field. Who says we have to live with just oil, gas, & coal? An oil Oligopoly non free- market govt controlled regime setup 60 years ago? Time for some real change.

8962 2018-08-16 02:21:00 .@dawndish, you have such a good rep from cleaning up the wildlife in oil spills, how can you support Fox & Ingraham (racist dog-whistling)?  Won’t buy you again even though used it exclusively
8963 2018-08-16 02:20:57 I thought so. Stink bombs are deadly disgusting and in the heat.  Makes for an even better comp. Can’t wait for the slip and slide HOH tomorrow. Any spoilers? Grease or oil this year? Any hints? #bb20
8964 2018-08-16 02:20:42 Then there's the fact that freighters coming into the Great Lakes divert into Canadian waters to empty their bilges bc the US has zero discharge laws. Internationally,  ships dump 7 Exxon Valdez worth of oil into the oceans each year! Not one bit of press.
8965 2018-08-16 02:20:41 you’re right he just needs scalp oil
8966 2018-08-16 02:20:23 I really need to remember that I own an oil diffuser. This seems to help the stress.
8967 2018-08-16 02:20:18 That's a nightmare of a way to go. One hopes he drowned instead of boiled alive. I'm unsure as to the state of the oil but I'd rather drown then boil alive.
8968 2018-08-16 02:20:13 Selling Books so fitting for the Snake oil Salesman in Chief!

8973 2018-08-16 02:19:22 PPK y Toledo fueron socios en el negociado con Hunt Oil (gas de Camisea). Ningun periodista caviar ha querido tocar este tema por mas que The Wall Street Journal publico la historia hace años. Mismo proceder de PPK que con Odebrecht.

8975 2018-08-16 02:19:03 Misreporting about the DNC’s resolution on oil and gas PAC contributions. All the reports saying this reversed an earlier resolution is wrong, but the coverage is so widespread at this point that it’s functionally impossible to correct.
8976 2018-08-16 02:18:24 So Walter Plumb wants to evict patients who are using cannabis oil to stop their child’s seizures, because it supposedly violates his (our) Mormon beliefs?

8977 2018-08-16 02:18:13 Unfortunately, I think they are buying the snake oil line that they will see the benefits down the line. These are people who are used to delayed gratification. When someone says, "It'll work out," they understand that. It's akin to setting aside egg money, and going to church.
8978 2018-08-16 02:18:09 Promoted 3x in my timeline within 24 hours. Y’all really trying with oil BS.
8979 2018-08-16 02:18:09 Dabbed lavender oil on my pillow, read before I went to bed, stayed away from my phone, had only 1 shot of coffee today. What more can a woman do to get some good nights sLEEP???

8981 2018-08-16 02:17:30 Asked a couple of my oil field buddy’s what there was to do in Big springs since that’s where I’ll be working for a little bit and their reply was “the only good thing about big springs is that Lubbock is only an hour away” 
8982 2018-08-16 02:17:28 GHWB, GS and H, MB, and idiot MSM. Those are the crooked treasonous lead dogs for all 4.

8986 2018-08-16 02:16:25 You convinced me to go get one, last thing I need is for oil to get on my rear tire. D:
8987 2018-08-16 02:16:22 I went to Wal Mart for tea tree oil and left with $50 worth of make-up
8988 2018-08-16 02:16:22 Don’t forget completely ignorant of the economic reality that the handouts they think they deserve are largely from the sale of Cdn oil. Some of the most vocal naive self destructive virtue signalers live in BC. #TrudeauMustGo

9004 2018-08-16 02:13:52 sometimes I think I’m smart then I remember that my car broke on the highway for good because it had no oil in it and I had 3 jugs of oil in my trunk waiting for me to literally just put them in the tube thing

9015 2018-08-16 02:12:13 Tea tree oil is also supposed to be good for it. When my nose piercing got infected, I used a crushed aspirin. You mix it w a little bit of water and pat it on. The aspirin will dilate the vessels around it and allow the infection to clear.
9016 2018-08-16 02:12:06 TRY +6% overnight, but broader risk sentiment is hit. U.S. stocks are lower led by techs, VIX near 17, copper is in bear region. Good news - oil is down to $64.50 on poor sentiment. #Markets

9043 2018-08-16 02:07:46 The plan sucks and the oil sands need to be capped right now but that doesn't mean the rest of the country doesn't need to improve and that doesn't mean that carbon taxes are not a very useful tool to accomplish needed reductions, change behaviors and fund clean tech.
9044 2018-08-16 02:07:37 I'm still waiting for you to fix the oil companies like you said you would. Since you became president has prices in my area are up by more than a dollar a gallon.

9045 2018-08-16 02:07:31 I found out that adhesives come off best with oil. I came home with adhesive from eeg leads and had a bottle of neutrogena oil cleanser and it wiped right off.

9069 2018-08-16 02:03:33 Perhaps because they have so many other pressing problems to deal with like oil pipelines across their properties, outside influence on tribal councils and the BIA consistently screwing them.

9073 2018-08-16 02:02:44 Alberta’s running over capacity. Would need to get it to Eastern Canadian refineries, which requires building a longer, more expensive pipeline. 

It’s about profits, not getting stable oil supplies. Somehow it’s cheaper to ship Saudi oil to Irving by ocean.

9100 2018-08-16 01:58:00 Oil change 
9101 2018-08-16 01:57:58 It’s not... Trump’s whole schtick is to convince people to be afraid, find someelse to blame their fear and woes on, and promise that he is the only one with the solution, even if he has no clue what the actual problems really could be

The very definition of “snake oil salesmen”
9102 2018-08-16 01:57:36 Thank you! I didn't want to use more oil or water, so that was perfect!
9103 2018-08-16 01:57:21 Just to settle an argument, can anyone tell how much revenue has been raised from oil in Scottish waters since the seventies?
9104 2018-08-16 01:56:56 Who can think of some original date night ideas? Post them.After 18 years We would be In a tent, with a bottle of wine, 2 glasses,butt naked with baby oil LMBO! #MarriedHumor
9105 2018-08-16 01:56:50 There two problems: A kid got eaten by Alligator and 61 year old man dies after slipping into vast of oil and it gonna haunted and workers need to be more careful SOO #Rip again
9106 2018-08-16 01:56:42 Ed can we bankrupt the oil sheiks by squeezing the nations that provide them brain/brawn (Turkey, Egypt, Pakistan etc..) whom they’ll then have to prop up? A valid geopolitical strategy!!
9107 2018-08-16 01:56:39 If BC doesnt want our oil they could at least be courteous and keep the smoke down. #smoke
9108 2018-08-16 01:56:36 Thank you. Just melt some milk chocolate, with a little coconut oil, dip the strawberries (or whatever you want) in, then let the chocolate harden. 
9109 2018-08-16 01:56:27 I commend Canada as the ultimate liberal democracy in defence of its values. Cannot believe Europe's western democracies silence in this matter and keep overlooking KSA's brutalities against its people and neighbours....What would've happened if Hitler had oil and money?
9110 2018-08-16 01:56:03 But seriously the fact that a man that believes things that those school shootings never happened, contrary to all evidence, is allowed a platform to spew his idiocy and sell snake oil to the ill-informed is infuriating.
9111 2018-08-16 01:55:55 You can both be right but on diff time frames. If the *world* can't grow enough beans at $8.50 they're going up in price, but it might take a year or three. In Feb 2016 the world looked at $26 oil very briefly and said, "nope, can't do it."
9112 2018-08-16 01:55:50 Soap and water lang. Tas laging magpunas ng mukha para hindi magbuild up yung oil na nang aattract sa mga microbes na nakatira sa body natin. Kasi pag nagsamasama sila, nagiging dahilan yon ng clogging of pores na nagreresult into pimples.
9113 2018-08-16 01:55:48 So I got a new tripod for my 3DIO and it's DOPE. Way less movement when I do oil and stuff now. BUT Im missing a vital piece to it so it's high enough off my desk. It will be here tmrw. Been enjoying the new WoW expansion so I hope you guys don't mind that I've no-lifed it for---
9114 2018-08-16 01:55:39 China removed the 25% Tariff on USA Oil.
Why isn't the Media talking about this?
9115 2018-08-16 01:55:26 After those 3 weeks we definitely have to wine & essential oil
9116 2018-08-16 01:55:20 Its elementary jack. Cities have shit O2. Do yourself a favor and 1, enjoy your life. And 2, realize hopefully tesla pushes against oil. Thats about all we can do right now
9117 2018-08-16 01:55:14 yep - and I'm glad he explained ExxonMobile is oil and gas, I didn't know that. 
9118 2018-08-16 01:55:02 Had someone put peppermint oil on the multiple broken bones in my hand last year. Thanked them and let them know I’d probably still have surgery
9119 2018-08-16 01:54:50 You let the talking heads with their exaggerated and fabricated grievances fill that void, its a fake bond. They just selling snake oil: nutrition supplements. Comes down 2 ur inability 2 think critically.  This aint insult, this is based on accute observation of the environment.
9120 2018-08-16 01:54:50 How’s it mean. The City of Philadelphia put Crisco on light posts to keep Eagles fans off. It didn’t work so the Dancing Idiot Mayor switched to industrial motor oil that didn’t work but when it rained washed into the river. That’s mean
9121 2018-08-16 01:54:45 Our domestic oil production is great again. Thank you Mr President.
9122 2018-08-16 01:54:37 Depends on whether the oil is mined (in which case the forest is levelled entirely) or extracted in situ. In situ extraction (for deep oil sands), ~8% of the boreal covering the land concession is cleared, but in situ concessions account for 21% of the total land mass of AB.

China rose and became a major world power in a relatively short period of time in the modern world. Do you think anywhere in the middle east will achieve this and become a huge world power in the business world-- outside of oil-- and w…

9130 2018-08-16 01:53:57 Kev: I have to get this oil at Vitamim World cs it helps clean..
Teja: what are u getting at Underwater World? 
: WHATTTTT? 
9131 2018-08-16 01:53:56 That is the point, because of Israel has many enemies in the Middle East.  Israel is a major liability for the USA.

Yes, oil is an American interest in the Middle East and Israel hinders this American interest in the Middle East.
9132 2018-08-16 01:53:46 @KiaCanada Your cars seem to burn a lot of oil.  Why isn't this something you tell your customers? I feel like there is going to be a big issue once all your cars out there get higher KM's and start breaking down #enginefailure #KiaCanada #MyKia
9133 2018-08-16 01:53:44 Could also mix it up with coconut oil and coffee grounds, sugar and lemon
9134 2018-08-16 01:53:41 If one light comes on that dashboard just start weeping  let’s not even talk about oil change. Tufiakwa who deh rush me

9136 2018-08-16 01:53:33 On lonely nights when Serena is away, Vinnie and Topsy (Topsey?), hang out together, discuss the worlds problems and drink multiple olive oil shots together until one of them passes out. It ain’t pretty
9137 2018-08-16 01:53:23 Peppermint oil! Spiders hate peppermint
9138 2018-08-16 01:53:16 Don't use Oil the west will invade
9139 2018-08-16 01:53:15 It depends on the vape pen and what you're toking (oil, wax, flower), but they can be pretty discrete.
9140 2018-08-16 01:53:00 You should use a beard oil. Go to thing yun ng bearded men :)
9141 2018-08-16 01:52:59 That the one I was waiting for loved the fun with oil
9142 2018-08-16 01:52:38 Oil production is very profitable at current levels, given the ability to sell at world prices. Our (Alberta’s) socialist, overtly idealistic neighbouring provinces and weak federal leadership is what killed the deal.
9143 2018-08-16 01:52:36 Let's sell the strategic oil reserve to USStates. I'll get a good price!
9144 2018-08-16 01:52:27 Noooo!!! maybe it’s just an oil change alert
9145 2018-08-16 01:52:16 このセンス好き。
9146 2018-08-16 01:52:10 I don’t think, I guess more I hope he wasn’t Mansplaining you, honestly a lot of people have never heard of CBD oil. He probably could have worded it better.
9147 2018-08-16 01:51:34 141:5 Let the righteous smite me, [it shall be] a kindness; And let him reprove me, [it shall be as] oil upon the head; Let not my head refuse it: For even in their wickedness shall my prayer continue.
9148 2018-08-16 01:51:28 A friend of mine uses CBD oil for her fur baby .helps with the pain.
9149 2018-08-16 01:51:25 Is there no way to refine our own oil and sell what we don’t use
9150 2018-08-16 01:51:25 Oh yeah, and we’re probably only doing it so China doesn’t sue us in the secret arbitrations we agreed to, inadvertently starting a shitstorm with the US and Saudi Arabia. 

Except we’d never say those fights were about petty things like oil... that back currencies.
9151 2018-08-16 01:50:33 Me: Sometimes I scroll through Instagram hiding all the snake oil ads and marking them not relevant.*

Husband: And you sometimes think I waste time on the internet?

*Because they are so effing not relevant. And every five posts? Way. Too. . Much.**

9155 2018-08-16 01:50:24 Aromatherapy is, surprisingly, not nonsense. Clary Sage oil and Ylang Ylang oil mixed are wonderful ( can get both on Amazon )
9156 2018-08-16 01:50:10 How would you even make an emulsion with just oil and garlic??

9161 2018-08-16 01:49:39 That’s old news.  and  and olive oil. In the words of the Peep: “Do it!  You’ll love it!”
9162 2018-08-16 01:49:29 I completely disagree. Let consumers do their own research. If you’re dumb enough to give money to someone who a year ago was an oil hand, you deserve to lose your money.

9164 2018-08-16 01:49:21 First, it’s “they’re” not there. Comparing us to Venezuela is just silly. Venezuela is under a dictatorship & economic collapse because they depend almost solely on oil exports. Look at every other western Democracy -they all have universal care. We are the odd man out.
9165 2018-08-16 01:49:15 I got my oil changed .
9166 2018-08-16 01:49:07 #Oil prices plummeted as much as 3% overnight on a significant build in US crude oil inventories. The slump of oil prices is in line with worsening base metal markets. #Copper markets continue to fall, now down as much as 20% from its previous peak in June.

9172 2018-08-16 01:48:11 Are they moving away from oil? It's bad that the best example of 'socialism that works' is built on oil.

9176 2018-08-16 01:47:32 The energy industry provided 7.7% of all jobs in Alberta in 2013.   Exporting oil is fine but..there’s a whole lot of other people doing something else. Tx for chat.
9177 2018-08-16 01:47:32 This essential oil diffuser is the best thing that has ever came into my life why haven’t I invested in aromatherapy sooner
9178 2018-08-16 01:47:29 How ironic that an oil country might own most of Tesla.

9180 2018-08-16 01:47:10 Volatility may surge as global markets react to the unfolding concerns on geopolitical risk. The energy and material sectors may be vulnerable as oil prices slump and base metals continue to fall. #oil #commodity

9192 2018-08-16 01:44:23 Pipelines and railways only transport the oil. Tar sands has nothing to do with it. Give your head a shake!

9197 2018-08-16 01:43:14 Wait why do they have a vat of oil?
9198 2018-08-16 01:43:13 Frosting has vegetable oil so....there's that.

My favourite moment is either arriving at the Oil Rig in Fallout 2 or the Prydwen arriving in Fallout 4.

9210 2018-08-16 01:42:21 I’ve made ravioli a couple of times this summer. This falls under: challenge accepted. Just olive oil on top or a sauce?
9211 2018-08-16 01:42:15 Hey y’all 
Lavender oil helps with mosquito bites
9212 2018-08-16 01:42:04 I suspect that Crimea means major, major money for Drump. Tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars paid by Russia into DJT's Cayman accounts. Don't forget, Russia is as wealthy as Saudi Arabia on oil production.
9213 2018-08-16 01:41:47 Tea tree oil is amazing! I use it for so many things and a little goes a crazy long way!!
9214 2018-08-16 01:41:45 Again, none of that research took into account the quality of the oil.
9215 2018-08-16 01:41:36 Gonna state the obvious. have you tried Melatonin? Calcium/Magnesium helps, Kefir is high in those.  valerian tea? Essential oils/aroma therapy  Bergamot oil & lavender oil, in addition to sandalwood, frankincense & mandarin, were combined to create a useful sleep-inducing blend
9216 2018-08-16 01:41:20 Why is there a vat of oil at Disney and where do they keep it?!?
9217 2018-08-16 01:40:56 Ya, perhaps they can discuss the possibility of increasing the port capacity on the west coast so we can import more foreign oil and petroleum products.
9218 2018-08-16 01:40:46 And the reason the IMF seemed to embrace even crypto...was the realization that the population refused a $180 Billion added fee in a carbon credit system...the profit of crypto to the system made up for that, and now oil and gold can return to their new equilibrium.

9237 2018-08-16 01:38:50 Coconut oil
9238 2018-08-16 01:38:28 It’s fake damage 150 body !!!!!!
9239 2018-08-16 01:38:20 Don’t forget, Muslim nations are inherently difficult as they never have an oil or commodity independent success. They are clueless and struggling to grasp simple common sense . Their perfect dreamy lifestyle we truly do adore is based on feudalism . Democracy has not been tested
9240 2018-08-16 01:38:09 Nothing fake about standing up for an independent judiciary, against partisan judicial elections & for disaffected GOP who believe in the checks and balances of our democracy.@anglin4justice didn't make rules, just followed them. Even children know changing them in middle wrong.
9241 2018-08-16 01:38:03 Some of these extra fees built into oil and Gold translated into stability. In order to avoid instability, they may test 10 year lows, but will not return to prices that don't guarantee the basics of the system, simply to avoid chaos and anarchy.
9242 2018-08-16 01:37:57 After civil rights Black folk got some protection from law enforcement. Now that Whites are maga, Black folk need to make a pot of grits or hot water or oil handy again for uninvited visitors .
9243 2018-08-16 01:37:50 What about putting back Industrial ARTS in all our NJ schools, by removing these wonderful past programs you have killed students that wanted to use their hands more.   Some kids now can't change their cars oil.  None of this above will improve our schools.
9244 2018-08-16 01:37:34 Easy to do: rip, not soft plantain.

Warm shelled peanuts in oven.
Spray lightly with oil spray. (Don't use olive oil: it spoils the taste.)
Grill directly turning a lot until right texture for YOU.
Split Plantain. Line inside with butter.
Add peanuts.

Thank John Obeto! 
9245 2018-08-16 01:37:27 Taking free oil from the ground and selling it is not an example of socialism working. OMG.
9246 2018-08-16 01:37:11 I always make my own. Peanut oil, popped up fresh! Salt for traditional, butter for splurging (real butter, girleen, no fake shit), and Old Bay if you want spicy. 
If reduced to the horrors of microwave, go with Newman’s, or Safeway Organic. They’re tolerable.
9247 2018-08-16 01:36:59 Crude Oil $WTI has a really important support at 64.66 USD. It is currently trading at 64.97. I think if this level is held a big rally is coming. Sentiment is very bearish (contrarian call).
9248 2018-08-16 01:36:52 Freedom loving Texans want your oil supporting, NRA loving, greedy, party over people ass out of the Senate! #BetoForTexas #BetoForSenate
9249 2018-08-16 01:36:48 The smell of tea tree oil 
9250 2018-08-16 01:36:44 It’s a forest fire.  It has nothing to do with pipelines or oil.  Except the fuel & oil used by the aircraft, vehicles, machinery & extremely brave firefighters saving our butts.    Without oil & fuel they wouldn’t stand a chance.  Be save brave ones 
9251 2018-08-16 01:36:19 今日よくよく考えたら、メンテじゃん・・・
9252 2018-08-16 01:35:59 Lol I was stung by a wasp at 10 years old.  Mud and garlic!  Mud cooled it off and helped with the swelling, although my pinky was the size of my thumb.  And the garlic oil soothed.  I think it was the power of suggestion, but it helped.  
9253 2018-08-16 01:35:58 Add alittle bit of olive oil and apple cider vinegar. Also excellent
9254 2018-08-16 01:35:54 Can yall change yalls oil bc the smell of burning oil got me lightheaded 
9255 2018-08-16 01:35:48 Eyelashes! They are designed to carry debris (oil, skin cells) away from your lids. So if you move your frames or they aren’t adjusted correctly, they make contact with the lens.
9256 2018-08-16 01:35:46 He's crying like a baby, I remind everyone that babies are given the snake rattle to neutralize them to the fear of a snake, this makes babies desensitized to the danger of snakes, don't you know what snake oil even means? They take your power and give it up to machines.
9257 2018-08-16 01:35:38 Took my shirt off to avoid getting oil on it while stir frying. Didn't think about where the oil would go.
9258 2018-08-16 01:35:13 cooking in glasses = pre-meal rubbed in oil smears

9264 2018-08-16 01:34:47 Thank u for sharing the facts...We thought that being an oil rich country Iran is a wealthy moreover a happy nation
9265 2018-08-16 01:34:21 I had this weird dream that in order to succeed in life you had to go through these like stages/levels where you would have to torture yourself to get through the other side. I had to lather my stomach in oil and press my chest down on a burning hot pan in one of the stages.
9266 2018-08-16 01:34:10 Tonight's bedtime routine: lavender bubble bath, chamomile tea, lavender essential oil on pillow, lit soothing candles for an hour, 10 minutes of meditation, dissolve into a self-hatred anxiety spiral, cry over nothing, watch vine compilations till 5am, hate self.

9270 2018-08-16 01:33:23 You can't just cut taxes to the middle class and expect them to do better. Services still need to be paid for. We need to stop dumping money into companies like Irving Oil, that can't run without government assistance, and demand that the rich pay their fair shar of taxes.
9271 2018-08-16 01:33:19 Kinda like the breaks that oil, gas and coal get...to the tune of a reported $20B/yr. Why don’t u guys ever mention this?
9272 2018-08-16 01:33:17 *girl on chopped adds extra sesame oil to her dish*
me: yeah, chris santos is going to HATE that
chris santos during judging: good dish, but try less sesame oil 

i think i’ve watched too much chopped, friends
9273 2018-08-16 01:33:15 Regardless of brand, or whether it has claims to be cold pressed, natural, and/or organic, coconut oil will clog pores and is not good for the skin.
9274 2018-08-16 01:33:13 Mrs. Schlorer’s is the BEST! Can’t find it anywhere. Mayo with olive oil is a good substitute for Mrs Schlorer’s
9275 2018-08-16 01:33:10 Olive Relish

¾  cup roughly chopped pitted olives, a mix of black and green
¼  cup extra-virgin olive oil
½  lemon, skin on, seeded and finely chopped (about 2 tablespoons)
1  garlic clove, smashed
 Red-pepper flakes, to taste
 Salt and pepper

9281 2018-08-16 01:32:13 Yeah I live in this crazy state, northern NM is just a bunch of liberal communists. I live in southeast NM were the oil is we don’t like them and they hate us but love that so called dirty oil money. If you’re not a CRIMINAL in NM you don’t have no Rights.
9282 2018-08-16 01:32:12 they’re funded by the oil industry. There was a huge campaign by them saying that they were bad because they were “too loud” lol
9283 2018-08-16 01:32:10 tea tree oil is my Girlfriend
9284 2018-08-16 01:32:09 Iraq war was attacked for oil - there was no weapons of mass destruction - lied to the American people - hundreds of thousands of civilian lives lost - between iraq and afghanistan over 6000 U.S. soldiers lives lost - caskets flown back home not allowed to be covered by the press
9285 2018-08-16 01:32:02 BA/ML: Total cut-off of Iranian oil exports would lead to price spike >$120. For every 1Mbpd imbalance = price impact on Brent of ~$17. $USO

9298 2018-08-16 01:30:07 Reality is that everything over $688 was artificially inflated into the price of Gold, just like every Oil price north of $58 per barrel was artificial inflation to justify further exploration and gigantic expenses for security payments to justify building the protection system
9299 2018-08-16 01:30:03 I'll let you know! It had good reviews so I'm crossing my fingers. My other friend suggested rubbing castor oil onto your scalp for 5-10 minutes before shampooing. Imma try everything

9309 2018-08-16 01:28:01 Could be, but I will resist you and your crazy ideas until I die.
9310 2018-08-16 01:27:55 SNP were big fans of GERS in 2014 when oil prices were booming. When the arse dropped out of oil though and GERS showed more difficult to sell outlooks then it all became a Tory/WM propaganda tool. TBH prior to salmond shouting about it then I’d never really heard of it
9311 2018-08-16 01:26:49 Reminder: change your oil
9312 2018-08-16 01:26:46 Explain how "that's rather shitty" and how it's "snake oil".

You are just another poorly educated uninformed remainer, like the vast majority spouting #ProjectFear BS about #Brexit. People like YOU are causing economic damage, get an education & stop being part of the problem!
9313 2018-08-16 01:26:41 Ohh exfoliating your pits is great to do, I’ve been deodorant free for over a year and heavily rely on lavender/jasmin oil + exfoliating constantly. My pits are so happy
9314 2018-08-16 01:26:33 it might be rose essential oils. loads of fragranced products use rose essential oil to scent their contents but it’s a common irritant. hard to avoid unfortunately :/
9315 2018-08-16 01:26:22 PMB economic policy is major on diversification away from oil, I.e fiscal - taxes, tariffs and monetary center on 5 specific areas
..... Agriculture 
......Power 
.......Housing 
.......Infrasture development 
........Manufacturing 
His next term is for consolidation.
9316 2018-08-16 01:26:00 Irving Oil is run nearly entirely on tax dollars. Hell they would almost certainly run massive deficits if they weren't cheating the intentions of the system and bullying governments at every turn.
9317 2018-08-16 01:25:37 The #NDP needs to support workers progressive ideas and economic growth all across Canada .
Supporting manufacturing gas burning cars and not supporting exporting oil is hypocritical.

9319 2018-08-16 01:25:30 Gary few sticky bottles and some of that expensive chain oil should help.
9320 2018-08-16 01:25:28 Nothing a little coconut oil and a cucumber can't heal 
9321 2018-08-16 01:25:28 be it the leader of the vile tory or Labour, the revenues of oil will be needed to bring more policies of social good to the country just as the vile tory uses it for war and tax cuts for the rich

It's not the colour of the political rosette but the system that needs be smashed

Indexes ended lower as Turkey's currency crisis & global trade tensions weighed on investor sentiments. Treasury yields fell. The dollar index pared earlier gains, while gold prices slipped. Oil prices fell on news of surprise jump in US crude inventories

9412 2018-08-16 01:13:08 The international oil price backed to $50, but there is no way Chinese gas price can back to ￥5.9 again. Yeah, the sad truth of living in this country.
9413 2018-08-16 01:13:07 A gentle double cleanse is a good first start. I use hemish for my oil cleanse & Huxley for my regular cleanse. Cosrx makes excellent pore reducing serums that I swear by. I’m also a huge fan of innisfree volcanic clay mask once a week for minimizing & exfoliating.
9414 2018-08-16 01:13:00 Indeed. It’s impressive how they dip into oil revenues for fiscal stimulus when times are rough and funnel it back to the fund when they meet targets.
9415 2018-08-16 01:12:58 I mean I never salted meat 24 hours in advance, blanched vegetables, pre-heated my pans before adding oil, or macerated my onions before reading it! I swear this is the book.

But ... guys ... @chalkyheart PAINTED the cover for it. Like actual fucking oil on canvas for the cover. I can't WAIT to show you the finished thing.
9441 2018-08-16 01:10:28 Oil drillers must take steps to prevent pollution of freshwater supplies. That’s a burden isn’t it? Any action requires some sort of reaction to keep from jeopardizing everything associated with the action.

9452 2018-08-16 01:08:24 I have this concoction of peppermint oil and lemon juice in a spray bottle that I use to douse my window sills and doorway every few days. Idk how effective it is but at least it helps me sleep at night
9453 2018-08-16 01:08:22 Thank you Gov. Inslee for your strong, relentless support of renewable energy—and for opposing the Trans Mountain Pipeline that would send 100's of oil tankers across our unspoiled waters—& would virtually guarantee future disastrous oil spills.

9459 2018-08-16 01:07:26 "will allow employees to receive their wages in petro funds over fiat." 

Essentially still fiat. They can and will lie (probably a lie from the start) about one petro being backed by a barrel of oil. Black oily lie built on high quality tech.

9503 2018-08-16 01:01:50 Crude prices at their peak under GEJ were about $130/b.

In Naira, that came to about N21,450.

Even if we claim N140/b, that still comes to N23,100 using N165/$ as the exchange rate then.

Now, at $75/b, crude oil comes to N22,875/b.

Yet, NNPC has been complaining of no money!

9528 2018-08-16 00:57:50 Model 3. No need for oil pressure, tachometer or fuel gauge (who needs to monitor that by the second anyway). I’m quite accustomed to a center cluster and don’t find myself breaking laws. With AEB & Autopilot, I don’t see a need for any instruments being front and center.

9535 2018-08-16 00:56:35 @AreuCathy Wind power generated 15% of all energy in TX even though TX is the U.S. largest producer of oil.  

So clearly there is no need to kill birds in TX with wind turbines.
9536 2018-08-16 00:56:24 The US has ordered all countries to cut Iranian oil imports to zero by November..

9541 2018-08-16 00:55:55 Its tar.  Until the toxic diluent is added, there is no way to get it to flow like oil.  Big Oil has been trying to confuse people about it forever, as if renaming something changes it.

9548 2018-08-16 00:54:50 Please tell me how a man dying in a vat of oil on the back of a flatbed truck is funny? Please let his family/friends know that you think it is funny so they can share in a laugh. You were trying to be ironical by linking it to Disney World, but it wasn't linked. Not funny at all
9549 2018-08-16 00:54:44 Just like snake oil salesman daddy.

9557 2018-08-16 00:53:36 Go move to Venezuela or Cuba if you think socialism works!  A rich country like Venezuela with their oil is starving it’s people!  The people are rioting!  Get it

9559 2018-08-16 00:53:29 It's terrible in salads, but not bad in soups.

But toss with olive oil and salt, throw it in the oven until crisp...f'ing delicious!
9560 2018-08-16 00:53:26 Yeah I do oil every 3k and air filter every 12k. Would rather buy used and own it outright than get a lease or a loan
9561 2018-08-16 00:53:21 I can support whoever I like. Our oil money is ours we can spend it however we like. And how did we destroy Mecca? Mecca is considered a mega project.
9562 2018-08-16 00:53:13 Trump NEVER had credibility...he is nothing more than a con man. He should sell snake oil at a carnival
9563 2018-08-16 00:53:02 God damn I really feel for @GHardstark and @KarenKilgariff $10k, apology, taking merch down, and still not good enough for the outraged over a tent.

9570 2018-08-16 00:52:25 As someone who LOVES meat, I’ve been incredibly surprised by the versatility of fried tofu. Press out the water, cut it up and fry in a little oil, it’s great in a little stir-fry or something
9571 2018-08-16 00:52:20 Don't forget the Greek salad oil, vinegar and feta bits you can soak up with crusty bread.

9586 2018-08-16 00:50:46 What’s a few million dead sea animals, scorched earth, earthquakes where there shouldn’t be any and flames shooting from your faucet? Think of all the money the execs at big oil could be making and spending on themselves! You might get a low wage job out of no more earth...
9587 2018-08-16 00:50:44 His answer resides in his question. Alberta oil!
9588 2018-08-16 00:50:42 It all goes in the same Pipelines. 

The clear difference is the transport and differentials accrue to Canada under EE and to the US under XL.  The US buys our light (&heavy) oil and sells us back light oil at a profit. $50 million a day in lost revenue #genius
9589 2018-08-16 00:50:42 We just won't go near any vats of oil...

Obama gave nuclear power to Iran
And North Korea. The 2 people who hate us, & Obama let terrorist go free. THAT'S A TRADER. Obama let the oil leak in to the ocean for 87 days. That makes Obama a Terrorist.
9598 2018-08-16 00:48:26 1. He colluded with a foreign country to get elected

I always liked tarte 12 hour for oil
9629 2018-08-16 00:43:24 Sounds tasty. I thought some olive oil would be used. It's good stuff. Thanks

9655 2018-08-16 00:40:16 Why is there oil in a kids place anyway? 
9656 2018-08-16 00:40:16 Getting rid of oil 100% across the board isn't the play.  Youre talking about flight physics.  I'm talking about society wide dependence on carbon.  You make entertaining fallacy though while we talk about different things..

9671 2018-08-16 00:37:54 Her oil paintings are amazing.  Such a talented woman. So sorry to hear of her loss. Condolences to her family.
9672 2018-08-16 00:37:45 6” motor oil color plastic worm....
9673 2018-08-16 00:37:27 Is that a booklet of DIY postcards? I guess I shouldn't be surprised that those exist, but it's still super cute that it does. What did you paint with? I'm no artist, but the mountains look thick like oil but the grass looks thin like watercolor. How'd you do that?
9674 2018-08-16 00:37:26 Based on old unreliable Soviet data apparently, with potential similar to Bolivia. While difficult with oil, the way to avoid 'lithium addiction', as you put it, is a diversity of technologies, like capacitors, so your core original argument is weak.
9675 2018-08-16 00:36:53 I need some car oil from Walmart.. who coming wit me 
9676 2018-08-16 00:36:47 By the looks for your shoes and shirt you changed your oil congrats
9677 2018-08-16 00:36:40 Also, I don’t love cauliflower but if you take a whole head and slice it in 1/4” big slices and then rub with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and East in an oven on a cookie sheet at 350 till the crispyness sets in.........yum!
9678 2018-08-16 00:36:34 8:30 And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with him, and sanctified Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.

9685 2018-08-16 00:36:16 I just tweeted a thread about small local energy river turbines ,  it’s all of these innovations together,  like a teeter totter, slow weaning off one onto to other  ,innovative ideas, all creating jobs and exports ,  Canada is more than oil,  only 20 percent of its exports

9695 2018-08-16 00:35:45 Actually, I'd rather live near a nuclear power plant than a coal plant or Alberta's oil sands operations. Nuclear waste is regulated and my impression is that regulating fossil fuel waste is seen as offensive or delusional tree-hugging nonsense.
9696 2018-08-16 00:35:40 Depends on how much oil we use. At work there probably up to my neck. Not with the holes plugged but probably with them open. At an really big place like Disney world definitely.

9717 2018-08-16 00:34:52 That's...really reasonable. Gonna work on not letting my brain back me into a corner like this over a bunch of dumbasses who buy snake oil.
9718 2018-08-16 00:34:45 All all he has to do is get his show to broadcast offshore.  I’m sure someone could kickstart this.  Get an oil rig or large boat and move it into intl. waters.  Mount .50 cal BMG’s on it and have folks move food and essentials as needed.

9720 2018-08-16 00:34:33 You're wearing them with socks! This is serious! You have Grampitis! Soon you'll be wearing Hawaiian shirts and asking teenage girls to sit on your lap! The only cure is to strip naked, cover your body in motor oil and run through the town yelling "I DESERVE THIS!!"

9722 2018-08-16 00:34:28 THE AJAOKUTA – KADUNA – KANO (AKK) GAS PIPELINE.

9730 2018-08-16 00:33:08 Nope.  Neither of them. I, unlike liberals, understand economics. Harley is building a plant there because they are trying to get into Asian markets and they're tariffs prevent that. Completely understandable, but again..Math and Democrats are usually oil and vinegar

9744 2018-08-16 00:31:00 The lady told me I would have to wait for two hours for the mechanic to be free and my oil change but in less than 10 mins she says “They’re going to start on your car in 5 mins” 
9745 2018-08-16 00:30:56 Broccoli rabe is one of my favorites. My grandmother would leave a bowl of it on the stove for me after sautéing it in olive oil and garlic. I make it all the time—will have to grill it!

9757 2018-08-16 00:29:22 Yes. It’s spread to the rest of the world. Obviously... but, where was all this technology originally developed? Did the Swedish develop space exploration? Did Venezuela develop the Internet? What country was first with wide scale vaccinations? The US is the largest oil producer
9758 2018-08-16 00:29:21 You're better off that you don't.  Its conspiracy theory, attacks on minorities, being a cuck for corps, and selling snake oil products.

9760 2018-08-16 00:29:00 All he fucking said was you wanted to buy oil from other counties and not your own!!

9775 2018-08-16 00:27:24 Im not anti oil but to not recognize pollution for what it is, is foolish. To say there will never be electric agriculture equipment is naive. As for now the creation of gasoline from carbon capture and storage is beginning and i believe it is the future of the oil industry

9784 2018-08-16 00:26:37 absolutely same. I think mayo is over-used at times but it's got its place (and also aioli is mayo god damn it, it's just egg and oil, its a useful suspension). I've just enjoyed seeing people show their ass over mixing up condiments
9785 2018-08-16 00:26:25 Olive Oil Mayo is where it’s at
9786 2018-08-16 00:26:25 Existential threat. But they are no longer a state, exporting oil and funding terror with the oil exporting. The flow going into there from Europe, via our buddies in Turkey of new recruits is over. It is decimated. It could come back but I trust Mattis to come up with a solution

9788 2018-08-16 00:25:56 Musk seems to be panicking lately. But this Saudi financing is so over-the-top for a guy who is so anti-oil future. I am wondering if there are forces out there who really want to take Musk down. Especially oil companies.

9797 2018-08-16 00:24:18 You are as Republican as Bernie Sanders is. You just keep lying. Russia only wishes HRC was elected. Trump has hammered them. Trump also is selling oil to Europe which hurts Russia too. Russia is now in a recession. Thanks to Trump. Your fake news is a joke.
9798 2018-08-16 00:24:15 Vitamin E oil is really really good if you want clear skin or for hyperpigmentation, scars, cuts on your face to heal/fade fast overnight. The Kirkland brand found at Costco or Samsclub with the gel capsules is what I use.

9816 2018-08-16 00:20:37 CBD oil has helped me with this!! You can get some that you rub directly on an affected area and it's helped me a lot.

9819 2018-08-16 00:20:18 Lmao it’s a brand of shortening/oil.

9822 2018-08-16 00:20:14 That's interesting.  Doesn't HSBC also fund coal power plant projects around the world?  That's a hell of a lot worse than the oil and gas we produce for consumption with vehicle emissions standards that are much higher than most of the countries they do business with.
9823 2018-08-16 00:20:09 The big auto executives have been 50% of the problem (oil being the other 50%) - of course they want hydrogen so they keep making their crappy ICEs. But the EV genie is out of the bottle, even if (for speaking too openly) Musk now falls (the way Jobs did)

9825 2018-08-16 00:19:48 So imagine bringing home a BBQ chicken from the market (Ralph's, in this case) and seeing it has a label saying NO SALT ADDED. My heart sank. That's okay, popped it in a roaster pan with oil, seasoned the hell of of it, and it might just be edible for the next few days. WTF!
9826 2018-08-16 00:19:34 Best way to cook kale...
Sautee in olive oil because it makes it easier to scrape off the plate and into trash can

9829 2018-08-16 00:19:09 Yes. CBD oil has also helped me personally but it varies person to person 
9830 2018-08-16 00:19:09 @IFPTrainingNews hello! I was wondering how can I get un touch with your team. Last year I was part of the #MOOC Oil&Gas course and never recieved my certification.
9831 2018-08-16 00:18:57 For years I’ve seen people run oil and gas work from central London, and moan about people’s salary demands; the reason the project is in London is because the directors’ wives insist they live there.
9832 2018-08-16 00:18:46 #mining $GLD #energy #economy $ES $OIL “Mathematical optimisation” sounds complicated. And that’s because it is. But really, it’s just a technical way of saying we’re using maths-based technology to make better decisions more often, saving time and millions of dollars in the…
9833 2018-08-16 00:18:41 Getting a little tired of these banks! We have Bank West that won’t support coal,oil and natural gas here in Wy! F Bank West!
9834 2018-08-16 00:18:26 I am a “distributor” for the essential oil one  I just like the oils. The peppermint helps my migraines a lot and they are relaxing scents annnnnnd that’s where it’s at lmao
9835 2018-08-16 00:18:12 If you want to go meat free without being vegetarian you can pan fry zucchini+onion+peppers in some oil, add a little salt early and then some beef or chicken stock around the half way point. Won’t satisfy your meat craving but it’s good and has taste.
9836 2018-08-16 00:18:04 @Oil_Can53 you see that bs thing Ureña did?
9837 2018-08-16 00:17:59 Straight lemon water, dove & tea tree oil 
9838 2018-08-16 00:17:57 Fuck him.

I once told Michele Bachmann biking was important because it let god-fearing Anoka County Lutherans bike to church on Sunday without using oil.

She hugged me.

9843 2018-08-16 00:17:13 A Tyler/Longview contrast?
I always heard the oil people with money settled in Tyler and the roughnecks went to Longview.

9846 2018-08-16 00:16:39 I did that at an oil change place, actually about 5 minutes before closing, and the manager couldn't have been nicer and more proactive in providing service.
9847 2018-08-16 00:16:32 Lol the snake oil i bought didnt cure my boneitis, whats your opinion on the more expensive snake oil, snake oil salesman?

9853 2018-08-16 00:16:04 Awesome thank you! 2.5 Years ago, I was diligently working on the women’s face oil formula and I realized that there wasn’t even one for men. That’s when I go to work.
Its our turn.
9854 2018-08-16 00:16:03 Not all on the same sandwich. Some examples are:
Avocado sandwich has hot sauce. 
Grilled cheese has salsa. 
My own “salad” sandwich has oil & vinegar.
9855 2018-08-16 00:15:40 Those two can not mix like oil and water.
9856 2018-08-16 00:15:36 keto is way to go. cut out glycation damage and lower free radicals. i’m all about cruciferous veggies and grass-fed beef, wild caught fish, coconut oil, olive oil, avocados, cod liver oil, pasture-raised eggs, etc.
9857 2018-08-16 00:15:19 I spilled an entire bottle of almond oil in the bottom of one of my bags with a polyester/faux suede lining. Anyone know how to clean that? I soaked up some with paper towels, I've tried dish soap and letting it soak overnight in baking soda 
9858 2018-08-16 00:15:00 Well I missed the oil wife stuff because I was distracted with Jeffrey star but I can like the videos where she makes fun of sssniperwolf for being part of the gaming community and then hypocritically uploading her own gaming stream
9859 2018-08-16 00:14:57 The GOP era in Oklahoma is over. You all have turned this state into a laughing stock and bankrupted our schools and hospitals. It's time to put Oklahomans first and elect a real leader who will put PEOPLE over the oil and gas industry. Elect @DrewForOklahoma!
9860 2018-08-16 00:14:55 Idk how to spell tht thing it goes w every Albanian dish like a side it’s sour cream w dill and olive oil and cucumber and garlic how y’all spell it zaziq? Zazik? Tsaziq? man idk but it slaps
9861 2018-08-16 00:14:48 So I didn’t feel like getting new tires or a oil change  so I just got a new car  blessings ..
9862 2018-08-16 00:14:01 Aloe vera oil or gel can keep them away
9863 2018-08-16 00:14:00 We need a politics based on rational people-first positions.  As long as corporate money determines our political system we will prioritize profit at the expense of people.  BP Oil will determine energy policy and private prisons will determine criminal justice policy.
9864 2018-08-16 00:13:48 Climate change has made Eastern Oregon hotter and drier and now our fire season is 25% longer than it was 30 years ago. And yet you take $250,000 a cycle from the oil & gas industry.

Do you realize how ridiculous you look tweeting about these fires?
9865 2018-08-16 00:13:30 Anyone in the auburn area who likes to work on cars (I.e. oil changes, filter replacement, routine maintenance stuff) and looking for a job, DM me
9866 2018-08-16 00:13:19 Ariana is a  commercial pilot that likes Mustard oil on their tomatoe pizza with whisky
9867 2018-08-16 00:13:09 Your initial statement did not say *season-to-season* consistency is a myth. It said "there is no such thing as consistency. Consistency is a myth, and those peddling it are selling snake oil."

Why did you make an overarching claim about a very specific rule?
9868 2018-08-16 00:13:08 Get yourself a turnip and some olive oil at the grocery store
9869 2018-08-16 00:13:07 I must've bought the black seed oil pm cause that shit make me sleepy every time

9873 2018-08-16 00:12:18 Trudeau is a two faced sack of shit, look at his politics on electoral reform, climate policy, you name it.  Same guy is going to spend 15 billion dollars on an unnecessary oil pipeline while thousands of indigenous Canadians don't have clean water.
9874 2018-08-16 00:12:17 There was a patient today talking to me about CBD oil and she kept saying “There’s no TCH” 
9875 2018-08-16 00:12:16 You ever get into hash oil?

9878 2018-08-16 00:11:39 mood i bought an essential oil vapetoday
9879 2018-08-16 00:11:18 You mean like the ISIS you arm and fund? TOO bad we didn't steal the oil instead we handed it to other thieves? You really think this is a solid take? Your neighbor invades your home gives it to some one else and you don't think you might be upset and looking to move?
9880 2018-08-16 00:11:03 The squeaky wheel gets the oil.  Trump's base constitutes a mere 22 - 25%.  He/the GOP can't WIN without cheating and interference.  They have to make enough noise that it seems that there are many more to his supporters than there really are so as to intimidate.
9881 2018-08-16 00:10:30 …ぐぅ

9885 2018-08-16 00:10:04 depends what you put in salads. Oil&vinegar or  just lemons. Think about what’s easier to digest. Also smaller portions. And instead of walking trying running. 15 mins of sprints and your set to go. Helps your metabolism and you’ll be burning more even while you’re doing nothing.
9886 2018-08-16 00:10:02 I can watch it on Lucas Oil Racing TV.
9887 2018-08-16 00:09:37 They were until recession hit then private sector made cuts especially oil and gas. Suncor/syncrude immediately sent out notices advising of cuts. Meanwhile Gov continued the gravy train
9888 2018-08-16 00:08:46 Mix a lil baby oil gel with the baby lotion 
9889 2018-08-16 00:08:35 would you really want a snake oil salesman that makes up his own reality MAKING YOUR MAC AND CHEESE?
9890 2018-08-16 00:08:32 Will do. Let me see how to do it. I'll private message you once I get it done, or if I have questions.
9891 2018-08-16 00:08:25 Swipe some Coconut oil 
9892 2018-08-16 00:08:23 Of course he supports gold mining in Quebec with its big enviro footprint. Can’t live without gold! But screws Alberta and the Oil Sands every chance he gets. Bloody hypocrite.
9893 2018-08-16 00:08:16 well fUCK a bitch was driving without oil for a minuteeee
9894 2018-08-16 00:08:11 Motor oil
9895 2018-08-16 00:08:02 doctor told me baby is fully engaged today so you bet i’m drinking raspberry leaf tea, eating pineapple, walking & taking evening primrose oil pills till this baby gets here
9896 2018-08-16 00:07:51 Even after he retired from Exxon Mobil he was in talks with the Russians about moving their oil. It's the reason Putin annexed Crimea. They needed the port located there to get the oil out of Russia and into the shipping lanes.
9897 2018-08-16 00:07:42 My favorite memory this year is when my players decided to see how flammable bugbears were lighting a whole group of them on fire with oil and flame... Nothing like the smell of burnt hair and goblinoid flesh to wake you up in the morning...
9898 2018-08-16 00:07:38 i once dropped both a blender and a deep fat fryer on my head, luckily the oil had cooled down, otherwise that shit could have done damage!

because of IBS I can eat only specific food T_T
But eh, I will probably stop this binge-eating today or tomorrow and be back to my another unhealthy eating habits :0
9909 2018-08-16 00:05:45 What is a “vat of oil” and how did he fall in there?
9910 2018-08-16 00:05:44 I'm on that mayonnaise from scratch with safflower oil. I'm on that Costco jar of best foods.

9914 2018-08-16 00:05:03 I do not know how you eat it, but the avocado with a green oil, lemon and salt inside a bread is a delight.
9915 2018-08-16 00:04:56 Mayo is so yum. Make your own with grape seed oil. 2 minutes in a blender.
9916 2018-08-16 00:04:56 I’m frying zucchini fritters in coconut oil but the eggs will be cooked in bacon grease because I’m not a monster you know.
9917 2018-08-16 00:04:53 What's the sexual for wanting to rub baby oil on finn balor or seth rollins, but not wanting to do anything with their penises or buttholes?
9918 2018-08-16 00:04:51 I’m at the store,  woman asks “excuse me, where can I find olive oil?” Mind you, I’m wearing shorts, silipa, vala si’i AF, carrying my reusable bag, not looking like anyone’s grocery clerk. I refuse to believe people are THIS stupid, but...
9919 2018-08-16 00:04:30 It’s a better oil silly 
9920 2018-08-16 00:04:24 I’m always apprehensive about putting coconut oil on my face
9921 2018-08-16 00:04:21 @Agent1023456 vis oil in Norway It was from the outset. It wasn’t taken from private investors at fixed prices
9922 2018-08-16 00:03:55 Or maybe, it is time that the over 2,000 billionaires start to actually pay for their wealth.  Everybody can have electricity solar, wind, and hydro power, but there is little money made in renewable power, oil and coal are the dollars that are made on the backs of working class
9923 2018-08-16 00:03:37 NOTE TO SELF. Don't drink chili oil, ever again.
9924 2018-08-16 00:03:29 WHY DOES MAKEUP COST SO MUCH
yeah I'll stick with my like $12 neutrogena oil free acne medicine including foundation that's too light for me
9925 2018-08-16 00:03:17 I grabbed and essential oil roller today and went to the register to buy it and she said omg how cool I make these! So I asked her what oils she puts in “flower child” and she goes to tell me it isn’t pure essential oils.. it’s part oil part fragrance.... SOOOOO I told her
9926 2018-08-16 00:03:13 Dude, you ain't no oil painting yourself. You can hardly mock Trump for having a few extra rolls. Pot, kettle, black.

9928 2018-08-16 00:02:37 @jenniferbeals Great to see you singing with a beautiful new picture. Please reveal the hair care products. Do you use coconut oil? Argan oil? No poo? I am guessing you stay away from the parabens and sulfates. I found this amazing product line called As I Am and it is amazing.
9929 2018-08-16 00:02:31 i hate when i get out of the shower after work & i find a spot of oil on my arm still  gotta take a whole ‘nother shower
9930 2018-08-16 00:02:25 also also, be sure to make your room your little safe haven. you’ll be glad for that once your classes start in earnest and you need a place to relax! I got an oil diffuser and some different oils to help me focus, relax, or sleep 
9931 2018-08-16 00:02:14 Stick it in a bag of rice, add a little oil, ginger, scallions, carrot, peas, egg. Cook in a wok until delicious
9932 2018-08-16 00:02:13 Thank the great Talib for standing up against the oil companies!  Hail!  Hail!  Hail Talib!  Only he fights them, and the indigenous people should be thanking him!  /S
9933 2018-08-16 00:02:12 @mrlube Could you please tell me how much a standard oil change costs at one of you 130th Ave location in Calgary? Thank you!
9934 2018-08-16 00:02:05 Reagans staff sucked too.James Watt (Dept. of interior) sold off public lands to oil companies for pennies on the dollar, likely giving a head start to global warming...and we knew it then too.

9937 2018-08-16 00:01:39 u and @SherpaKeith   will need to create a username in your telegraph account so I can add you guys to the Crude Oil Notebook channel. @oil_tradr is added. I will  discontinue the posts to the notebook on the website..too tedious.
9938 2018-08-16 00:01:36 Any chance this a byproduct of Deepwater Horizon oil spill?
9939 2018-08-16 00:01:30 I think most importantly would be how to export more palm oil produce & products to China, which could be used to off set loans taken from previous gov. In addition, we want more regulated China investment in Msia to curb raising prices of properties, goods etc.

9941 2018-08-16 00:01:19 Wealth creators , just like our oil workers and their companies in Western Canada. Unleash them all and watch what happens.
9942 2018-08-16 00:01:18 You had me at bedroom & olive oil!!
9943 2018-08-16 00:01:11 I am not an expert, but it’s pretty obvious. Coupled with breaking the Iran deal to help ruzki with the price of oil, it’s pretty clear on what side @realDonaldTrump administration is on.
9944 2018-08-16 00:01:08 Such as the gulf oil disaster?  Shocker
9945 2018-08-16 00:01:06 I agree Vienna sausage is the tried and true canned meat, but the sardines in oil seem like they'd be a good time
9946 2018-08-16 00:01:05 Don’t you mean canola oil?
9947 2018-08-16 00:00:48 This bag of Skinny Pop has a slightly higher proportion of mushroom flakes than usual. Also realized it tastes better a good number of days after opening; the salt and oil combo almost tastes like butter now.
9948 2018-08-16 00:00:46 Mix 1 pound Black Beans with 4 tsps kingfish. Add generous amounts of Olive Oil. Set aside for 3 days Serve the next morning for breakfast.
