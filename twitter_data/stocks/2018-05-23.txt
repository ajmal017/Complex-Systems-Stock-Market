Musk is not issuing new stock, so he gains no value from the transaction.  Hey may issue new stock in the months or years from now but by then your trades will have little effect on the stock value due to the numerous trades that will occur.

48 2018-05-23 23:35:10 Dear Mr @elonmusk , I know you can not control why buys your stocks, But I saw recently in news a George Soros just invested $35M. My opinion is he is enemy of USA. Can you discuss the relationship, if any? I don't want to be connect to him in any way, even by stock ownership.
49 2018-05-23 23:34:41 Don't have to like the same stock. but also don't have to trash stocks that are down, and especially without any backing.

83 2018-05-23 23:02:08 @andyjayhawk - Andrew, I’m no where related to @elonmusk or Tesla. I tell you this - media sucks big time. Where’s the news? It’s only propaganda and opinions. The only news I found is in Sports, Weather, and Stocks. The death for big media is very near.
84 2018-05-23 23:01:55 The primary strategy needed to control gun violence in schools and elsewhere is quite simply to control guns! Civilians should not be able to buy military weapons like the AR-15. We need a waiting period, background checks, and bans on both bump stocks and magazine capacity.

97 2018-05-23 22:52:01 Precisely, that is NOT modified to full auto. To modify to full auto takes a different sear. Bump stocks just make your finger hit the trigger faster, but it's still 1 shot per pull. I can create the same effect using my belt loop. 

NOT auto.

105 2018-05-23 22:47:57 It's possible, but way riskier. It's definitely good advice to take heed to. For example, you may not be able to set stop losses and other automations for penny stocks. This may depend on your broker. But w/major listed stocks, you definitely can. This may save you while @ work!
106 2018-05-23 22:46:45 These auto parts retailers $AZO $AAP $ORLY will be good recession plays. In a recession I think more people do their own work on their cars and keep used ones in need of repair longer. None of these stocks had major declines in the financial crises of 08. $AAP pays a dividend.

113 2018-05-23 22:41:39 Aussie market will likely struggle to perform again today due to a selloff in commodity stocks overnight. UK had weaker than expected Euro zone manufacturing data and lower than expected UK inflation numbers come out causing the UK FTSE had its biggest fall in two months.

120 2018-05-23 22:38:11 Actually, the tax cuts did nothing for the average person but thank you so much for the corporations!! They bought back their stocks, paid huge dividends to stock holders(themselves) and now they’re still moving jobs out of the country. So we were screwed twice by the republicans

143 2018-05-23 22:22:03 You and the republicans in Congress are not pro-life. If you were there would be measures on gun control & bump stocks. Your anti-abortion but you’re not pro-life. A big difference!

146 2018-05-23 22:20:47 Socialism involves much more government. This tax cut was a measure to help companies buy back their stocks while giving really really small bonuses.
147 2018-05-23 22:19:33 $TSLA stocks is drama. At any point there could be news saying the company will implode. Or it will be 10x better. Rather than being a passive investment, it feels like a full-time job. I don't need another job right now, so I sold the few stocks I had today. Feels good 
148 2018-05-23 22:19:26 Goldman: "Given the increased confidence in the inflation outlook but more dovish commentary on forward guidance and the potential desirability of a modest inflation overshoot, we left our subjective odds of a June hike unchanged at 95%."

157 2018-05-23 22:10:34 I was traveling this afternoon, but it appears that stocks rallied because the Fed was dovish in the minutes.

166 2018-05-23 22:04:38 Hyperwave was found studying commodities. It works with credit, interest rates stock and bond indexes, individual stocks and bonds. The problem is, it is very rare. So much of the time it is unhelpful. When you find one, it is almost like magic.

185 2018-05-23 21:52:16 A mass shooting is never “funny.” The  reasons there are no mass knifings are because there’s no National Knife Association whose lobbyists bribe political parties.

195 2018-05-23 21:44:40 People ask "What's wrong with the economy"?  When Goldman Sachs makes $200M in a day in February when stocks plummeted because the bet for volatility.  THAT's what's wrong with the economy.  When people bet on failure.  Reminds me of 2008.  Shit hasn't changed.
196 2018-05-23 21:41:55 Inflation averaged 4.5% over that period. So you lost a TON of money in bonds in real terms.

I'll stick with stocks and real estate.

Great but not going to expand the economy. Bush tried it. It's going to hurt

221 2018-05-23 21:23:47 It wasn't a try, your question was unclear. Laying off workers is a requirement when closing down a factory. Buying back stocks is a requirement when you want to own more of your company's stock. How are these two things contradictory?
222 2018-05-23 21:22:37 I think people sometimes think the goal of investing is to be right rather than to accumulate wealth. Specialist short sellers doing deep dives in specific stocks are important for the market, but outside of these it's crazy: you are fighting against inflation and global growth

225 2018-05-23 21:21:55 Sorry, but the Susan Rice appointment was many months ago, it had nothing to do with the May 12th drop.  Maybe it was just a weak day for technology stocks.  By the way, the drop on May 12 was minimal.  Today it was surging!
226 2018-05-23 21:20:47 Rising stocks, on low volatility.  Fail that, and things get "tricky".  That's what happens once your stock market is 150% of GDP & your Federal debt is >100% of GDP.
227 2018-05-23 21:19:57 1) Sorry take issue calling them "make believe tariffs" when China sold back boats in order to get out of that risk. 
2) good. We need it with the near record amount of stocks and harvest pending. 
3) short term I don't see why it's assumed they couldn't have imposed a tariff.
228 2018-05-23 21:19:54 No one mentioned bump stocks until you did. But since you asked, they do not by definition (words matter) make them automatic weapons they should be legal... On top of that by my opinion automatic weapons should be legal w/o tax stamp, etc. Those are infringements
229 2018-05-23 21:19:40  you live in dreamland. Comments can ban bump stocks? Lololol. You're pathetic.

252 2018-05-23 21:04:15 I also think given it’s partially a career and the fact most of our capital and others capital is involved means it was a wrong decision.  Then again if those stocks continued to rise for the month I’d have been laughing now.

264 2018-05-23 21:01:56 You gave corporations tax cuts and they have been using that money to buy back stocks, to appease their share holders. All this happened before in 2004 and 2005 with the last stock cut. The little guy got nothing. He'll get nothing again. Learn to be fiscally responsible!
265 2018-05-23 21:01:32 Because layoffs are done to SAVE MONEY you pay out and buy back stocks when you HAVE money. 

You cant be broke and rich at the same time unless the government artificially injects capital into your business TAX SCAM. The Money to do this doesnt just materialize out of thin air

283 2018-05-23 20:54:53 So fake, no market manipulation, at least not any more than always has been in crypto or say stocks.  How market works, crypto's appear too overvalued to most people now...thats all.
284 2018-05-23 20:54:49 Una comparación más justa sería 1998-2009, no? El piso era bajísimo en 2002! Igual crecimos muy bien, pero nos consumimos todos los beneficios de los terminos de intercambios favorables sin generar stocks. Oportunidad perdida.
285 2018-05-23 20:54:43 Common sense to make it more difficult for deranged person to get guns. My son-n-law's 21 YO cousin killed along with 57 others & 500 wounded in 10 minutes by a madman in Las Vegas with semi-automatic weapons converted to automatic with bump stocks . Doing nothing is not option.
286 2018-05-23 20:54:32 A young man wise beyond his years! It’s inspiring to see people your age having such a passionate interest & belief in this new revolution!

287 2018-05-23 20:54:11 Elon's favorite things to do when he fucks up one of his companies is to 1) post on twitter in 2011 internet slang and 2) start fresh company so he can use the new equity proceeds to prop up the stocks he's already tarnished (the SolarCity saga is unbelievable)

296 2018-05-23 20:49:24 That's what I'm sayin'. If bump stocks are outlawed, only outlaws will have bump stocks. If you know how many there are, you know where they are and who has them. Thousands of easily identified outlaws out there. What are the law enforcement agencies waiting for?

302 2018-05-23 20:45:29 Crippling loopholes in our laws have enabled the NRA to infiltrate our communities and Republicans in Congress REFUSE to close them, including  enhanced background checks, bump-stocks, large capacity mags and age limits. How many MS-13 implicated in school shootings? AFAIK 0

305 2018-05-23 20:44:35 Oh doesn't like stock hit pieces?!  Join half my stocks that get hit for nothing!  BS reporting constantly!  Like they are paid off to do hit pieces.
306 2018-05-23 20:42:27 I’m not saying what they should or shouldn’t do.  I’m pointing out that it’s hard to argue that a stock trading at $300 a share is undervalued when they have not posted a profit.  Negative and positive news affects stocks. It’s not all sunshine and unicorns.
307 2018-05-23 20:42:16 Cool. How many stocks do you have in your portfolio? I am not invested in PPAP yet.
308 2018-05-23 20:42:01 Just read the stocks in Netflix took a dive once they announced the Obama's will have there own show. Plus subscribers are canceling there membership... What will you do??? I'm just not gonna watch!!!!
309 2018-05-23 20:41:42 purnell boys masculinity too fragile for all this
310 2018-05-23 20:41:04 We can also curtail the sale of high-capacity magazines and bump stocks. We can look to economically similar countries as models and to our past “assault weapons ban.” We should not simply throw up our hands, though. The status quo is untenable.
311 2018-05-23 20:40:28 More people would support NRA if they showed some flexibility but they even object to prohibiting folks on no fly lists from having firearms; universal background checks; ban of bump stocks. None of these infringe on your right to own firearms.  2nd Amendment supports regulation.
312 2018-05-23 20:40:01 How many lives have bump stocks saved? Shit, how many lives have assault style rifles saved? How many have they ended?
The nra pushed bigger badder guns for the masses when we need less guns out there. Don't you fkn people ever have enough guns and ways to obliterate humans?
313 2018-05-23 20:39:39 I'm not an expert but dividends are taxed at a higher rate than capital gains (stocks)
314 2018-05-23 20:39:04 U.S. stocks ended with small gains on Wednesday after minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest meeting suggested higher inflation may not result in faster interest rate hikes.
315 2018-05-23 20:38:54 stocks been going up like crescendo. 
316 2018-05-23 20:38:28 4. Don't have a herd mentality:

Following the crowd into the latest "hot stocks" or other assets like bitcoin just because everyone else is buying them is a poor way to invest. In other words, popular opinion should play no role in your investment process.
317 2018-05-23 20:38:20 For the next week. We have some awake bars to give away with tubs. Get yourself down with a bundle for a free bar!!  Whilst stocks last. #gfuel
318 2018-05-23 20:37:33 2. Investing in penny stocks doesn't usually work out well:

Many inexperienced investors think that buying speculative penny stocks is the best way to get rich in the stock market. More often than not, it turns out to be the most certain way to go broke.
319 2018-05-23 20:35:44 Trump The Talker! Just like coal jobs? Just like tax cuts for the middle class? Just like stopping the sale of bump stocks? Just like the wall? Just like “great” healthcare for all Americans? Just like no golf trips, that have cost Americans $67,455,349 so far? Trump The Liar!
320 2018-05-23 20:35:32 I'm seeing every day how Americans are losing freedoms because of monopolies and corporate collusion to control markets. Americans think they will win big gambling with stocks; the house almost always wins. #WakeUpAmerica
321 2018-05-23 20:35:31 I recently ordered issue 1 on amazon's comixology site after finding out that no comics shop in Glasgow stocks it. Can't wait to receive my copy, but is there a way to get your stuff stocked locally? How can I help get them in stores?
322 2018-05-23 20:34:56 Do I hold my Netflix stocks or sell them bad boys.  They  right now
323 2018-05-23 20:34:14 Well sir, that's why we have very rigid gun controls here in Canada. All gun owners having to take courses & get licensed. No assault weapons, very few private handguns.  Things like bump stocks & silencers are outlawed.  As a result, we've had  2 school shootings in 30 years.
324 2018-05-23 20:34:01 Mm, I do like bonds. And stocks!
325 2018-05-23 20:33:44 Great point. AMZN is up ~3,000% since Jan 1, 2008 (~300% since 1/1/13). If it's getting close to $1T valuation, which few US stocks have ever approached, how much more upside can there be? I sold some shares to recover my initial 2008 purchase, but concerns about upside remain.
326 2018-05-23 20:32:08 Conservatives do care, it’s just they don’t like ideas that won’t work (like gun control). I’ll explain, most cops would refuse to enforce, as California banned bump stocks after Las Vegas but a dozen has been seized so far. Even if you could, would you search every house in U.S?
327 2018-05-23 20:30:48 Lol I'm getting paid with beer to talk investing and trading stocks with a random man who had hit me up on LinkedIn

334 2018-05-23 20:26:45 When I post things it’s only because it’s a solid play. We don’t pump stocks we don’t short OTCs we know what we own. We saw $AXXA potential, never listen to the nay sayers only listen to yourself. This has a long way to go. Personally I have my sell at $.30 but let’s see!
335 2018-05-23 20:26:33 Because I dummy test limits of stocks all the time and today they were willing to take a lot more than I have ever seen before and for £10k block wanted 4.5p even before any trades today

343 2018-05-23 20:18:42 In case you were wondering, size today only appeared larger due to the lower priced $1-$2 stocks becoming the flavour du jour so the sizing was 5000 starter instead of 2500 for the slightly higher priced stocks.

353 2018-05-23 20:13:42 It’s the options trading, you make money when stocks go down also
354 2018-05-23 20:13:19 Just like the, could cause stocks to fall, could cause interest rates to rise, could cause an emergency budget, could cause jobs to decline, could cause the deficit to rise. Same old crap, project fear, no one listens anymore!!

361 2018-05-23 20:09:45 World stocks ex US fall: US +.3%; Europe -1.1%. Good FED news outweighed trade fears in US. Europe still concerned about tariff impact. All investors should weigh potential Trump actions & issues in their investing strategy.

375 2018-05-23 20:02:43 Get rid of the minimum wage. Intead of telling companies they can't pay any less, tell them they can't pay any more. Use a multiplier, include stocks & bonuses. Make it 500 to 1, 1000-1 if you want. With this example, the highest wage can't be any more than 500x the lowest wage.

391 2018-05-23 19:54:28 When stocks make a new high you have to remember that no one is bagholding it. This means that there probably are more demand than supply, which causes a increase in price.

393 2018-05-23 19:54:04 The volume will likely fade quickly. Longs will hope for squeeze realize it isn’t happening and constant sell off trying to salvage what they can. There is a reason grey market stocks trade less than pennies. $LFIN should fit in nicely just a matter of time....

400 2018-05-23 19:50:40 Why would we want to remove FoM? CAP needs reforming, no doubt, but not removing, we can do that via the usual democratic processes. The CFP has protected stocks that would otherwise have died out. It is needed in a common market. Next?

403 2018-05-23 19:48:18 Why I don't like Options much: 

There's too much guess work involved, and you have no control over the volatility panicky retail traders create. My stocks don't expire, and I can wait out their shenanigans if need be.

3) To ride the EV Tsunami, I suggest investors look to the EV supply chain.
412 2018-05-23 19:42:41 My portfolio is diverse. But buys are spread out by what has value at the time. With trade fees, it doesn't make since to buy a few shares of many stocks at one time. Rather I pick one at a time to add to. Lower trade fees means more money is left to invest.

435 2018-05-23 19:33:34 7. Don't own too many low-currency stocks
436 2018-05-23 19:32:44 They are dumb. The demand down here is astronomical. Human nature is to live near the coasts. You're not going to undo nature with a 30 year threat. Are you warning people but to buy stocks because the next recession will hit within 10 years?

515 2018-05-23 18:38:28 Trump Backs States Regulating the Marijuana Business
President Trump has endorsed letting states decide how to regulate marijuana, and the Democrats are intro legislation to decriminalize marijuana. This is a major boost for the legal pot industry and has lifted cannabis stocks.

580 2018-05-23 18:02:53 Yeah that's one possibility but I wouldn't do it without some awareness of correlated risk. For instance, in FX what if I have 5 XXXUSD positions? that's not really 5 positions? 6 stocks in a sector? 6 stocks in general? many ways to deal with these issues but need a plan.

585 2018-05-23 18:00:15 ...problem is as Alan Greenspan said in 2015, "If stocks just stop rising, let alone fall, it will very quickly put pressure on the US fiscal side."  Stocks have stopped rising for 5 months now.  If that persists, I'd expect negative surprises in US consumer data by mid-late 3q.

777 2018-05-23 16:36:31 European shares pulled back on Wednesday as U.S.-China trade talks stalled and a drop in crude prices slammed the brakes on a stellar run in energy stocks, while uncertainty in Italian politics continued to weigh on banks.
778 2018-05-23 16:36:31 The UK's top share index was knocked down of its highs on Wednesday and sustained its biggest loss in two months as oil majors and commodity-related stocks fell but well-received results made Marks & Spencer a bright spot.

859 2018-05-23 15:56:43 I've been doing this past 2 weeks lower size on first entry then bigger on 2nd. I was also thinking why not save the first entry and be a tad more patient. But I've noticed on some stocks that first entry is key not all of them go higher. Still a work in progress.
860 2018-05-23 15:56:26 "You aren't great until you are consistent"! Anyone can be a one hit wonder. But consistently pulling profits from the market day in and day out is what makes you a great trader.

909 2018-05-23 15:34:33 Higher C02 levels do assist plant growth - problem is lower nutritional value for grains like wheat. Same as collapsing fish stocks -  Millions go hungry.

945 2018-05-23 15:22:03 locals saying they left fishing due to poor pay, then complaining about EU nationals taking their poorly paid jobs. Complaining EU quotas caused poor wages.

1038 2018-05-23 14:47:14 I hear you on not selling things one doesn't doesn't feel one confidently understands.

But with headlines like the following, it might be worth considering from a profit standpoint.; "Iced Tea Company Changes Name to ‘Long Blockchain’ Increasing Stocks by 289 Percent"

1048 2018-05-23 14:42:27 @traderstewie Hey Stewie, quick question for you - how many stocks do you track? I've personally tried to cut my list down to max 25 but curious what others have in terms of a watchlist.
1049 2018-05-23 14:42:24 Can you picture a million computers dumping stocks like there is no tomorrow. Something ought to be done about this. Before it’s too late.
1050 2018-05-23 14:42:16 Thanks. I had not clicked on that link. Still though, the numbers change in a big way depending on the start date (and subsequent end date.) The main point is that bonds have been in a 35 year bull market since the early 80s, and have been less volatile than stocks.

1301 2018-05-23 13:08:42 Some people are forgetting that we are here to make money and trade stocks #tradethemdontmarrythem . #woulf are asking legit questions and N. is either poorly run or .. poorly run .  You can believe in the company till your nose bleeds , doesn’t mean it’s gonna get better/worst .
1302 2018-05-23 13:08:32 I don't swear at stock tickers. I swear at management teams. 

For tickers I just mutter the swear words to myself. Subtle but important difference. This was a good Q and guidance. Stocks never reverse anymore. That being the case I'd be cool w/ a 6-handle.

1317 2018-05-23 12:55:15 Well the man did promise to ban bump stocks and raise the purchasing age to 21 then completely back out on it after meeting with the NRA. If the people we elect to represent us do nothing, what else is there to do
1318 2018-05-23 12:55:12 Mainers are proud of our independent streak. But we won't truly be free until we get the NRA out of our politics and: 
1) Ban assault weapons
2) Pass universal background checks
3) Ban bump stocks
4) Ban guns for domestic abusers

1495 2018-05-23 11:03:52 My advice, take a legit course on how to trade stocks. Paper trade stocks before you use real money. It’s a lot to learn and will take a long time. If you don’t take a real course and take the time to paper trade, you will for sure lose all of your money!

1567 2018-05-23 09:52:53 You’ve been wrong so much about these stocks , you would think you’d reevaluate your perspective...
1568 2018-05-23 09:51:33 Momentum strategies are difficult at scale. There are only so many top names. There’s lots of liquidity when those momo stocks are rising, but that tends to disappear when they fall. For value style the opposite tends to be true, working for the investor rather than against.
1569 2018-05-23 09:51:24 Somewhat similar to dealing with after hours trading, just instead of waking up to a gap there's an actual candle there. The difficult part is deciding to stay away stick to your "trading hours" But yeah the 24 hourness is can certainly be a gift and a curse.  #forex #stocks

1578 2018-05-23 09:44:48 Bump stocks... eah no real thoughts or arguments from me there. People are going to mod guns legally or illegally. Hard to stop it. Considering it would most likely be after a crime when you find out..

1580 2018-05-23 09:43:40 Yes - stocks are key. Sadly too many people either try to time the market - or instead of going with a plan, they react to the stock market - panicking or getting greedy.

1614 2018-05-23 09:01:22 Circling back, however, this wasn't my intended point.  I was simply saying that trended absolute P/E is a poor metric at a full market level when the composition of the underlying stocks has changed.  Over time, it's shifted more to growth/tech stocks, which implies higher P/E.

1667 2018-05-23 07:53:47 If the market sell-offs now it would be very similar to the action in january when there was a lack of real bullish/bearish news and stocks just rallied on hot fumes before rolling over w/o any obvious news catalyst. #stocks #nasdaq

1669 2018-05-23 07:52:32 It smells more and more of risk-off. Turkey is melting down (both FX and stocks), Argentina is just barely stabilising, Pakistan is in trouble, Italy is a mess, North Korea summit uncertain. European PMIs are slowing down more than expected in May. Stay defensive... #stocks

1675 2018-05-23 07:45:34 I'm going to be real~IDK much about stocks or trading. But when I heard abt Stockpile I thought it would be a cool way for me to support Elon who is someone I believe in.  I mean, buying Tesla stock from a seller would still benefit Tesla right? Esp since I don't plan to sell it.
1676 2018-05-23 07:45:27 Yeserdays outside reversal was the bearish clue I was looking for to cut my longs and look at the short side more. It is hard to time thr markets via ETFs. I only trade stocks and then go long $UVXY when my stocks tell me we could be near a turning point. Just like Gil and Chris.
1677 2018-05-23 07:44:14 Hoping for a good day here

#iog been creeping up last few days. Times lines for 1st gas are good + the @OGAuthority awards are today

#MYN the SP stayed strong despite some seller, once he has gone then I think we will heard above 1p then on expected news double today's SP
1678 2018-05-23 07:43:45 Futures are tanking right now. Like I said y'day I wait for a real bearish clue and the outside reversal was just that. So are we in for another leg down or is this just a meaningless pullback? Nobody knows at this point, but stocks will tell.

1682 2018-05-23 07:40:59 The concept of having two water tight investment blocks works. In one you can play it for the long term and have 'safe compounders' and patient investing
For positional  you can exploit HEG type 'hot' stocks and be very agile. This is a practical investing and mental framework.

1796 2018-05-23 06:00:57 I don't think anyone thinks it's conspiracy. By my estimate, roughly 230 million people believe  the Fed buys stocks directly and are probably only wrong about the directly part.

1907 2018-05-23 04:34:58 I never saw Trump as GOP, he comes off more as a NYC business democrat. Notice how the republicans have unilateral control and they still never went after the topical issues people were venting about, like LGBT rights, marijuana, he even stupidly rants about bump stocks.

1913 2018-05-23 04:29:59 In general your tweets about crypto sound so much like people on ihub talking about otc stocks. They talk that way all the way down. The traders that take profits on moves typically have a lot more experience in this type of investing. They leave emotion out of it.
1914 2018-05-23 04:28:19 @Gautam__Baid Sir, Could you please let me know on how to get going with investments in stocks. I'm an investor. Any books recommendation/s for fundamental investor and on how to choose stocks? 
Many thanks.

It's a perfectly valid question
1926 2018-05-23 04:17:53 Look at the job growth over the last 6 years.  And since you mentioned stocks, look at that, too.  They were improving at the same rate.  When you say the economy was a bust, you are lying.

2039 2018-05-23 02:57:23 So Nifty could retest the lower level or could bounce back from 10200 before next bull market rally, time wise n pricewise consoildation going on. Time to invest in quality stocks.
2040 2018-05-23 02:55:25 Piyush's take on Markets 
Negative
Below 10500, Nifty will see selling pressure towards 10440 and 10350

Above 10570, Nifty could see relief rally towards 10680

2041 2018-05-23 02:54:47 Really bad use of corp tax cut breaks to buyback stocks near all time high.  

Govt should limit buybacks as short-term thinking quarterly reporting co's waste capital to juice share price & exec bonuses at the top. Leaves less cash for R&D for next upcycle
2042 2018-05-23 02:54:13 Regarding call centres in Zim, those who are into investing in stocks may want to have a look at the possibilities there, and those who make office furniture for call centres may also want to do the same, and so could the guys who own office buildings and space in the Harare CBD.

2047 2018-05-23 02:51:51 Long Russel + Dow and short S&P is my guess. Maybe a decent idea, since you don’t get destroyed if the S&P or tech stocks tank.
2048 2018-05-23 02:51:38 Incidentally, have you noticed that most market participants, everyone from David Tepper on down, are now staying long based on ERP models, i.e. stocks are cheap relative to corp credit or Treasuries, etc.? What's unstated is that this is a "greater fool" theory.

2053 2018-05-23 02:43:31 last year started a policy of 'renting' stocks, not owning. only do the trades w. decent premium. should I rethink my strategy? IMO, a selloff will hit EVERYTHING... so I wait and wait- but it feels nearer. Been raising cash but this week added naked puts>if I'm put, so-be-it
2054 2018-05-23 02:42:02 My point is that bold action inspires change. Proposing a ban on bump stocks isn't moving the conversation anywhere.

2065 2018-05-23 02:31:31 They were picking Harper up to two weeks before the election.  Polls today seem totally unreliable.  Trump, NDP in Alberta, Brexit.. it's like a chimp picking stocks on a dart board. Fun for pundits who have a 50/50 chance of I told you so, or incredulity on June 8.

2067 2018-05-23 02:29:54 We have to do things one step at a time. I definitely think the NRA needs to have its tax-exempt status revoked. Ban assault-style weapons and accessories like bump stocks. Limit ammo purchases. Require thorough background checks and waiting periods across all states.
2068 2018-05-23 02:28:06 I don't think they have a way of knowing how many bump stocks total in each state.
2069 2018-05-23 02:25:54 Ocean, Don't forget this: The ETF URA has just changed their scope from all uranium stock to add constructions companies & others. So, for 45 days they will be selling large % of all uranium holdings. In 45 days this ends so U3O8 stocks will take off. UEC is the best 1.
2070 2018-05-23 02:25:37 I feel the same way about your producers on your show.......it’s great to eliminate jobs with automation
2071 2018-05-23 02:25:36 It follows overall price action of the sector as a group. Some of the heavier weighted stocks in that group have similar chart patterns, but many don’t.
2072 2018-05-23 02:25:21 I think he means the market doesn't stop trading, unlike stocks closing everyday/FX closing every week.
2073 2018-05-23 02:25:06 Today’s dividends came from CAT ($0.78), ETN ($0.66), TXN ($0.62) and AAL ($0.10). I’ve now been paid a combined $59.14 from 36 different companies this month. #dividends #stocks #invest
2074 2018-05-23 02:25:00 It depends. I consider my self a trader that buys high and sells higher but when dealing with penny stocks or small caps you cant account for manipulation.

2084 2018-05-23 02:18:42 Ok, here is info that you wont get anywhere.  The ETF URA is now realigning positions so will be selling uranium positions for up to 45 days. They need to buy construction stocks.  This means this is a great buying period.  So, in 45 days it should fly since selling will ease.
2085 2018-05-23 02:15:54 I also reconized the traps in penny stocks as you may be familiar with. Let's say a stock has a float of 5 billion and it sells for 1% of a penny. The company will put out news and you are screwed if you invest bc you can never profit you lose. Float is King.

2124 2018-05-23 01:37:08 As an experiment, just today I reviewed my investments from back when I was a “value investor.” Of stocks I thought were undervalued, a handful sharply increased in value over the last year, but most of them were stagnant or even declined. Overall, I would have lost huge.
2125 2018-05-23 01:37:02 Armalite.

Again, assumptions.

Are bump stocks legal? Trigger mods?

Do these not make semi-autos perform similarly to full auto?
2126 2018-05-23 01:36:52 Bump stocks are a joke. As any educated person on guns and you'll find out. All the laws in the world won't stop this because they'll just get an illegal gun or use something else. The Texas kid had homemade bombs with him.
2127 2018-05-23 01:36:39 You can run a crossover scan everyday in Stock edge and that filters stocks that met the criteria only on that particular day. You cannot set stock specific alerts for moving average crossover. @zerodhaonline has now launched Sentinel Pro. Even that is price n volume alerts.
2128 2018-05-23 01:36:10 Here are 4 tips to be a successful investor:

1- Only buy what you understand.
2- Only buy if you did the research.
3- Don't follow the herd.
4- If it's too good to be true, It probably is.

2130 2018-05-23 01:33:16 The reason why 15/20 stocks in traditional equities is considered diversified is because of their correlation factors.  If crypto is highly uncorrelated between coins (a winner take all market) then the optimal diversification would be higher than in traditional markets
2131 2018-05-23 01:32:47 IMHO if Mnuchin gets fired, that is not bullish for stocks btw.
2132 2018-05-23 01:32:41 Likewise! Only ever use double bottom/double top as a bit of a signal. Not sure how a chartist can chart a stock which has been driven primarily by news flow (Iridium). If it helps somebody then fair play. Sentiment drives stocks, not charts.

2153 2018-05-23 01:21:59 He makes that because of the value of the company, i.e. his stocks that he's had from founding the company. He receives only about 80k/year in salary and direct compensation.
2154 2018-05-23 01:20:35 yes follow trumps money.  he jacks some company like Amazon so the stocks fall, has his minions buy it up, then the stock goes up, they sell and he makes money.  why won't he release his taxes, what money does he owe and to whom, what is he hiding.  TRANSPARENCY.
2155 2018-05-23 01:19:41 I can tell you I only spend my fun money on shitcoins.  All my crypto investments are on foundations.

I trade futures and forex as well.  Have stocks but put them in retirement plans.

Financials are a fun hobby for some.  It's a little bigger than that for me.  :-)
2156 2018-05-23 01:19:09 Just to make it clear, i didn't used any stocks in any of my North entrys 
2157 2018-05-23 01:16:24 HE is also Buying and Selling Stocks
2158 2018-05-23 01:15:05 Yeah it's really simple, quit losing 2 stocks before they do
2159 2018-05-23 01:15:04 This is basic investing 101.

Everyone loves being in that position, its ideal for a trader.

Stocks, futures, crypto...capital is king.

2160 2018-05-23 01:13:44 But all I hear from Ted is ban assault rifles, high capacity magazines and bump stocks plus universal background checks. None of which would have any effect in preventing mass shootings.
2161 2018-05-23 01:12:01 Paying off your house may not be the best investment. Invest in stocks while the going is good. Invest in Real Estate and pay more on your house when other investments arent
2162 2018-05-23 01:11:43 No, no not quite....this is a little different than stocks and equities....in the words of another housewife...you really are sad simple and dumb
2163 2018-05-23 01:10:55 The Federal Reserve is DIRECTLY enriching Wall Street, of that there is no doubt! Whether knowingly allowing frontrunning trades, leaking Fed policy decisions, reverse repos, or directly pushing stocks/futures higher, the Fed has one goal ... ENRICH WALL STREET!
2164 2018-05-23 01:08:12 Aim is full of junk companies that are pumped and dumped in a never ending cycle. I dont know why anyone who has more than two pennys understand that these stocks can be traded for a profit but will forever remain junk and not a long term investment?
2165 2018-05-23 01:08:06 true, but ive never heard of your ass. because no one introduced me to stocks But you tube is one of those things that make things, like tim sykes famous.
2166 2018-05-23 01:06:28 No the opposite. Either stocks will go down or rates/$ will go down
2167 2018-05-23 01:05:53 Prime News: European Markets Gain Amid Earnings as Italy Tensions Subside: European stocks rose on Tuesday, with Italy still in focus as country's president considered the candidate put forward by a eurosceptic alliance to lead their coalition government. The pan-European Stoxx…
2168 2018-05-23 01:05:39 Larry Summers was at Harvard recently claiming that trading stocks is a fool's errand because the professionals with all their tools "know" so much more.  The cold-stock thesis seems to be one he has not considered.
2169 2018-05-23 01:04:32 @GrapeJuiceMe You ready to teach me about investing in stocks? 
2170 2018-05-23 01:03:55 Many corporations are buying back their own stocks. Rich getting richer. Poor getting the shaft.

2172 2018-05-23 01:00:32 Ban bump stocks/mods allowing rapid-fire. Mandatory background checks for ALL sales. Parents (also) held responsible if they don't keep guns safely stored. Better pvt/mil law enforcement coord. of criminal records. 0-tolerance bullying policies enforced. NO to armed teachers!
2173 2018-05-23 00:59:52 Fixed it:  Repubs lining up for their bribes from foreign powers like their daddy Spanky gets.  Disgraceful Harley Davidson closing plant and moving it to Thailand and buying back stocks with their huge tax cuts.  Repubs are all crooks.
2174 2018-05-23 00:59:19 Stocks with a hard base hit! 
2175 2018-05-23 00:56:37 They were just as bad pumping tech stocks before the crash
2176 2018-05-23 00:55:05 Amazon wouldn't need to use ETFs - they could buy or develop a platform like @RobinhoodApp or @MotifInvesting to own portfolios of stocks (and maybe some bonds) directly
2177 2018-05-23 00:54:15 At a bare minimum, close gun show loophole, strengthen background checks, ban assault style weapons and bump stocks #NJ11Mikie
2178 2018-05-23 00:54:10 Aristocracy strapped onto Potato! WHILE STOCKS LAST!
2179 2018-05-23 00:53:50 Did someone say...retirement?! Stocks?! Bonds?! What’s that?
2180 2018-05-23 00:51:25 15 breakoutsL $AEL (200-day MA), $GBNK, $PLAB (gap and 200-day MA). Five sub-$1, Three $1-2. Still too many penny stocks in the scan results
2181 2018-05-23 00:50:31 Yes buy BHP and rio Tinto stocks. Anyway once Vedanta is pushed out they will get in and all protests will vanish
2182 2018-05-23 00:49:29 Well she could sells all those stocks and put an end to it immediately.
2183 2018-05-23 00:48:10 Way to go @realDonaldTrump & @GOP. Harley Davidson is laying people off, buying back their stocks, & opening a plant in Thailand. Is this how your tax cuts are bringing jobs home and giving people raises???
#DonTheCon #LiarInChief #TaxCutScam
2184 2018-05-23 00:47:45 REPUBLICANS! YOU DID NOT ASK ABOUT HARLEY? LET ME ENLIGHTEN YOU: 700 million in stocks returned to stock holders. Plants closing down and opening in TAIWAN !! A NEW PLANT ASSEMBLE LINE! 1200 WORKERS HAVE NO JOB COME JANUARY! 40% of the plants voted TRUMP! TRUMP DESTROYED THEM
2185 2018-05-23 00:45:44 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to cure your carpal tunnel syndrome
2186 2018-05-23 00:45:35 I believe in universal background checks and the 48-hour waiting period. I believe we can ban the sale of assault weapons and ban bump stocks. I am a hunter, but I believe we can reform our gun safety laws and still uphold the Second Amendment. #WEAUTownHall
2187 2018-05-23 00:44:25 And ban assault rifles and have universal background checks and ban bump stocks and close the loophole on selling guns at gun shows and increase mental health resources....
2188 2018-05-23 00:44:19 WATCH ITALY FOLKS!! #money #gold #bonds #silver #stocks #wallstreet #barrons #thestreet #cnbc #bloomberg #sports #music #cryptos #bitcoin #eu #uk #canada #mexico #ireland #brazil #japan

2190 2018-05-23 00:43:22 $FGF still holding. Like many specs that had a run up have now dropped down with lower volumes & buyers backing off with tax selling upon us. Happens every year. Mid july is the spring of stocks when they start sprouting. Blockchain/crypto will sprout again.
2191 2018-05-23 00:43:22 Win one more and I get into top 8  most of my matches have been two stocks, but gotta fight dexter next which will be tough.
2192 2018-05-23 00:42:42 You don't give a shit about anyone's life other than your own. You misspelled Melania. Your policies will directly affect your son Baron. And if you really cared about life you would do that executive order ban on bump stocks but you haven't.
2193 2018-05-23 00:42:17 Lets hope @RamseyCC have more than one bottle of cider left in their stocks this time, otherwise I could be in for another dry day ! ? !
2194 2018-05-23 00:41:44 Stocks grounds out to second base. One down
2195 2018-05-23 00:40:27 Due up: Stocks, Adams, Meighan!
2196 2018-05-23 00:39:33 I’m bored. Make bump stocks illegal, bust anybody that gives someone else access to their guns that isn’t registered & approved by a doctor, high capacity magazines illegal, military style high velocity rifles illegal, close the gun show loophole, body armor illegal.Wait & adjust
2197 2018-05-23 00:38:03 I’m thinking bitcoin/gold/stocks all rally tomorrow after the fed minutes make the dollar crash
2198 2018-05-23 00:36:09 Universal background checks, integrated data bases, age limits, ban bump stocks, high capacity magazines, and assault rifles.
2199 2018-05-23 00:35:44 Can you please tell us a couple weeks before you dump your bank stocks so the rest of us can plan accordingly this time? K, thanks.
2200 2018-05-23 00:35:35 Gas prices are up. Stocks are down. His son & son-in-law are doing business in Mid-East to detriment of US. #MAGAts
2201 2018-05-23 00:34:16 All good mate, just asking for some specifics. Thanks for the info. Hopefully some of these micros can start to get some loving as the larger cap mj stocks start trending up.
2202 2018-05-23 00:34:09 There is a recession in our future just as there is a bear market in our future. And it’s hard to imagine a recession not triggering a 20+% fall in stocks when it hits. It’s just sticks could be a lot higher than now when it does it
2203 2018-05-23 00:33:23 Trading and decentralized gambling are clearly the first major use cases on #ethereum. What’s next? My guess is digitalization of assets such as stocks, bonds, deeds, wills, titles, licenses, etc.
2204 2018-05-23 00:31:18 Bro I love penny stocks.
2205 2018-05-23 00:30:17 So stocks artificially inflated thanks to Trump tax cuts & resulting buybacks? No job creation but stock boom? Once again benefiting fat cat stock owners? Why no filthier class divide?
2206 2018-05-23 00:30:10 Aswear the F 35 made their stocks jump
2207 2018-05-23 00:29:23 Choice act passes house. Rolling back Dodd-frank regs for small lending institution and banks. Long on bank stocks into next week despite trade talk fears?
2208 2018-05-23 00:28:17 Yep. The only way to lose 90% of your money since 08 was gold stocks. The only way to go nowhere was gold. 10 years on.
2209 2018-05-23 00:25:24 $GMGI. Real DD avail on this already Revenue Producing stock.  We are resetting chart perfectly agree it's one week rise from 0004 -0028 stair step.  I have great confidence in this Co. Rome wasn't built in a day, and we want uptrending stocks that churn along the way. HEALTHY
2210 2018-05-23 00:23:47 Monday was a day of cutting SMALL losses for me on stocks like $AUR & then did a TERRIBLE trade on $BXN in at 8.6c selling at 7.6c (screenshots later today)

Tuesday was better, making 20% on #S66 ($S66 was an overnight hold) which wiped Monday's losses.

$MWR next #PumpNDump!!
2211 2018-05-23 00:23:42 Stocks turning lower as Trump casts doubt over Kim summit, @EngleTV is live from Goldman's TechNet in HK and Rio Tinto is ready to take $3.5b to exit Indonesia mine, this morning on @BloombergTV
2212 2018-05-23 00:23:21 ... ou bien peut-être qu’il a suivi les cours de Porcher à PSB et qu’il a des problèmes de gestion de stocks, BFR et autres flux de trésorerie...
2213 2018-05-23 00:23:17 You do know that largest manufacturer of bump stocks closed up shop on Monday right? You don not that you dont need a bump stock to bump fire a gun right? I'd bet you $100 you couldn't get a bump stock to fire.
2214 2018-05-23 00:22:43 $APGI looks ready for another run
2215 2018-05-23 00:22:28 I think the better angle is acknowledging that payout guarantees being replaced with contribution based ones, pension plans nonexistent, and investment across stocks that may rep unethical companies as a matter of course is more boosting stocks than retirement planning
2216 2018-05-23 00:20:30 Lauren is a qareen who trades stocks for a living.
2217 2018-05-23 00:19:57 #Nickel Price 14,695USD per tonne! Going to be a big year for Nickel stocks if this keeps going
2218 2018-05-23 00:19:33 The country is totally in the crapper! Never seen it this bad. My stocks are tanking bad! What should we do?
2219 2018-05-23 00:19:08 Few Aus Gold stocks are starting to get a little stretched to the downside. It's an area to watch closely imo.
2220 2018-05-23 00:18:36 @GrooveCubeMusic and @BolideOfficial always wipe a beautiful stocks .   
2221 2018-05-23 00:15:55 Grabe in just 1 day, nakaubos nanagad ako ng 28 stocks and im so so so haaaapppppyyyyyyyyyyy 
2222 2018-05-23 00:15:51 Expecting $CMGO to break and hold .02 tomorrow. Today the .02 wall was absolutely crushed but EOD sell off brought us back down to .018. The close above .018 was key though. That level had been trouble the last couple days. Higher lows higher highs continue
2223 2018-05-23 00:14:52 Des stocks as a master coach have dropped significantly. Any club considering hiring him would have to instill serious restriction on him regarding recruitment and staffing; and that would never sit well with him (I mean, his ego)
2224 2018-05-23 00:14:22 If you have worthwhile gains, defend them vigorously by keeping any other losses very small, especially in a so-so market.  Always rank your positions and know your strongest stock!  #stocks
2225 2018-05-23 00:13:37 I'm only part time and have only so many hours to complete things and not practical for me to do big projects simultaneously in the little time I have. Stop throwing me things at the last second just because you didn't check your stocks ahead of time.
2226 2018-05-23 00:13:22 roth ira is where you put money when you want to invest it in stocks/mutual funds so the interest/gains aren't taxed. you can also take out at any time, but usually you can only put in a max of 5.5k/year.

interest earned in a regular savings account can eventually be taxed
2227 2018-05-23 00:12:47 Too true.  I  keep forgetting to ask the experts if Amazon shareholders can file a class-action lawsuit against Trump for loss of value of their stocks attributed to his lies.  Does anyone out there know the answer?
2228 2018-05-23 00:11:47 These clowns ask me if we should ban bump stocks in GA. How about universal background checks to make sure violent criminals can’t buy guns at gun shows? If no BG, What is a gun show other than a formally hosted alleyway sale?
2229 2018-05-23 00:11:45 They`re so full of Shit!  They propped bonds & therefore stocks fell because they were`t propped. . .  : ]
2230 2018-05-23 00:11:24 Interesting question.....her husband runs a medical hedgefund and according to the financial forms they own pharma and  Medtech stocks jointly in the fund. MPR said their finances are complicated.
2231 2018-05-23 00:10:32 Let's see how far the stocks drop.  Already down 6% today.
2232 2018-05-23 00:10:13 Thanks @cgberube - this actually ties in nicely with @marsecgina's comments about the jurisdictional + maritime security issues associated with increased protein consumption and decreasing fish stocks...

2234 2018-05-23 00:07:35 Asia equity markets begin lower as region gets a headwind from US where stocks closed lower and DJIA pulled back from 25k, after Trump placed doubts on US-North Korea summit and was said to be unsatisfied with China trade talks; ASX 200 (Unch), Nikkei 225 (-0.3%), KOSPI (-0.1%)
2235 2018-05-23 00:07:04 No, we tried to tell YOU.  We told you banning the AR-15 wouldn't prevent a school shooter.  We told you small capacity magazines wouldn't prevent one.  We told you bump stocks wouldn't prevent one.  Are you interested in listening to people who know guns?  Or no?
2236 2018-05-23 00:06:56 Pit Bull - Martin S. Schwartz, trading in the zone (amazing!)
