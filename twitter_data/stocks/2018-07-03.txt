64 2018-07-03 23:13:40 My market observation: Although mkts sold off mainly on the heals of a few high profile stocks - due to lack of volume. If trade concerns subside expect a reversal Thurs as the Adv/Decl lines were higher today suggesting underlying accumulation.

126 2018-07-03 22:14:13 It's an age old trick. Through out any market including stocks. They plan drama and excitement around the investment quarters. Thats the piece 90% of people are missing. The cycles are hard to key in on. Unless you see the news triggers.

132 2018-07-03 22:11:21 Do this, or we cut off the flow of money. The donor class doesn't like democracy, they don't think we can rule ourselves, they want oligarchy. Just like they are currently engaged in crashing the economy, while shorting stocks. No one got richer during the '07 crash than the rich
133 2018-07-03 22:11:12 I still buy them but probably means they won’t carry new cds or replenish stocks.

- Ban Bump Stocks and assault-style rifles
- Increase age limit to purchase all guns/ammo

207 2018-07-03 21:21:43 I used to cover software stocks back in 2002 and our competitors would use 10-20% terminal growth rates for valuation while we would use a longer forecast period and then use nominal gdp growth for terminal otherwise the companies sales will eventually be bigger than the economy
208 2018-07-03 21:21:38 Sure, bad close on the stocks. But at this point, it's more about getting investors to really believe in $75-80 oil. Once that happens, a 2% wiggle backwards on a random Tuesday in July is gonna be very much forgotten.
209 2018-07-03 21:21:16 $TSLA is one of if not the highest volume traded stocks It is by far the most fluctuating stock in my portfolio. Mark my words it will hit the price target of $450 in the next 6 months.

There was no concern about throwing £billions out to private banks to inflate stocks and property. What is the point of austerity? It just slows the real economy and cuts spending power.

428 2018-07-03 19:13:06 You’re right Matt.  I think both of those trade proposals are too rich, and I’d be giving up way too much Blue Chip Stocks or assets.
429 2018-07-03 19:12:12 I can't give financial advice, but I will say most ETFs are much better diversified than you'd ever get from picking stocks.

Take a look at Sygnia's myriad funds, or the Satrix funds, or the Cannon Asset Management funds. They have funds with differing risk profiles, too.

451 2018-07-03 18:59:50 stocks are a reflection of long-term corporate earnings...which is not the same thing as short or long-term economic growth. so...no. the stock market is not the economy. tysm.

454 2018-07-03 18:55:47 But of course the bank is a smart decision if you don’t believe in yourself and want to keep your money “SAFE!” There’s not one wealthy person in America who has “safe” money! It’s well invested in business, real estate, stocks and etc. Higher risk, higher return!

497 2018-07-03 18:29:31 I think we generally agree, but I believe the S&P and Nasdaq examples in the essay don't support its thesis because, in the short term, the movement of the largest weighted stocks dominating is not a tail event. The Russell 3000 example does support it.

548 2018-07-03 17:58:00 Bump stocks are not "effectively automatic".  They fire one shot per trigger pull.  They are EXTREMELY inaccurate and the killer saved a lot of lives by using one...  They're only for fun at a shooting range, not for anything else.

Rather than allocate to investments regardless of their trend or valuation, we rotate between global stocks and bonds.
659 2018-07-03 17:00:01 Mickey, you are probably the smartest mining investor on this feed so I have a question for you.  The last I looked UEC had 14.9 mil shares short which is 9.9% where other sector stocks that are similar like URG or UUUU or even DNN are at 2-3.25%.  Thoughts on that?  $ concerns?
660 2018-07-03 16:59:33 Stocks cant get back up to upside amid Trade war uncertainty. Its time for you to end this political game
661 2018-07-03 16:59:21 Stocks are rekt.
662 2018-07-03 16:58:52 Yep blame it on immigrants. Couldn’t be trillions in tax cuts for corporations huh? Who reinvest in stocks rather than people.

664 2018-07-03 16:58:15 Stocks are a simple game. Millions of computers submit orders for hours and at the end, the Russell always wins.
665 2018-07-03 16:58:07 Oh I work...semi retired. Living off my stocks..it’s called working your a$$ off for over 30 years...and knowing how to invest ones money. Can you say you are semi retired at 50? I know I’m blessed for that but I also know I worked hard my entire life to be able to be semiretired
666 2018-07-03 16:57:47 hey @CNBC permabulls this must be bullish for stocks right? LMAO
667 2018-07-03 16:57:06 time to buy European stocks .!
668 2018-07-03 16:57:04 $SAEX one of those stocks that if you had the patience to hold, would of paid all day. sick.
669 2018-07-03 16:56:44 We're all sick of your "balanced portfolio" nonsense. What about some hot stocks you're in?
670 2018-07-03 16:56:43 Literally no one is trading stocks today -- just finance Twitterfags shitposting about their idiot stocks and disgusting set ups. Sad, truly.
671 2018-07-03 16:56:29 Stocks falling off a cliff!!!
672 2018-07-03 16:56:10 We're getting closer to a big move. Most stocks in a tight box $nvda $nflx just to name. I'm looking to take action on the box break in the coming days
673 2018-07-03 16:56:04 Main difference between this model and a standard term spread model is that probabilities of recessions after 1990 are larger. Not surprising, look how stocks contributed to overall net worth since 1990. Timing of both is similar, spread is the dominant variable after all.
674 2018-07-03 16:55:49 Stocks and broths are good too.
675 2018-07-03 16:55:38  invested in some stocks ON NASDAQ....
676 2018-07-03 16:55:32 As expected, Stocks open higher. Dow +110 points.
677 2018-07-03 16:54:59 $SPY Once again many panicking. Once again we're continuing to focus on select stocks like $ROKU $FSCT and more. Charts posted earlier.
678 2018-07-03 16:54:40 Bernie, I work a job paying $15 an hour PLUS commission and still struggle to pay for a tiny apartment, a car and bills. The only light at the end of the tunnel is the fact that I’m barely able to save like $100 a paycheck to invest in stocks so one day they’ll pay off.
679 2018-07-03 16:54:33 Not surprising. If their stocks go lower, they don't receive their expected incentive bonuses, so it is money out of their pocket. People don't like to lose money.
680 2018-07-03 16:54:32 it seems trump can’t do anything that makes stocks go higher ? All time low almost now .. Buying times for US right now..
681 2018-07-03 16:54:22 @safalniveshak do you review stocks or discuss them on Twitter as well
682 2018-07-03 16:54:20 Have thought about #stocks and not having a goodie bag or fliers - reduce the impact on the environment.
683 2018-07-03 16:53:32 And stocks don’t pay the bills either.
684 2018-07-03 16:53:02 #Stocks lower just before an earlier than usual closing bell #Dow slides after early gains, now down 131. Market will be closing 3 hours earlier than usual for an early start to #4thofJuly2018 @KNX1070 @MottekOnMoney #Happy4thofJuly
685 2018-07-03 16:52:27 I call bullshit. Walmart banned  the sale of AR-15s, bump stocks, etc. and raised the age to purchase firearms. They love their guns more than Trump and they still shop there.  #BoycottWalmart #fakehashtag
686 2018-07-03 16:52:02 Little wonder that Harley benefited greatly from your tax-slashing, buying back stocks & doing nothing 2 justify the oft-lauded & oft-predicted mega-growth that supposedly makes the country "great again." Now they're just moving overseas so they can further avoid taxes.
687 2018-07-03 16:52:00 My main stocks I'm in for this short week are $T and $OSTK. I have a $36.5 7/20 buy call for $T up $93 for the day n still $-19 for the week so far.

694 2018-07-03 16:50:11 I thought you professionally looked at data.. here you have just insinuated.. is that how you pick stocks too.
695 2018-07-03 16:48:53 Oh look, another right wing "boycott".  So...I guess we should expect to see Wal-Mart's stocks surge soon?  Seems like every time the right wingers boycott something, that business/person gets even more money.  #BoycottWalmart

705 2018-07-03 16:44:14 It’s good to see small cap stocks leading the market. Outlook is Bullish to neutral for the foreseeable future imo.
706 2018-07-03 16:43:57 We all want our stocks to do well but most have a moral compass
707 2018-07-03 16:43:23 Fall of demand in Shrimp prices in global...which could be temporary! But mostly due to the bad timing - taking into consideration the falling mid cap and small cap stocks!
708 2018-07-03 16:43:22 It is not even gambling because you are playing with chips that have no set values. Well actually google stock has a face value Of I think 1 penny. Stocks are like art or collectables worth only what you can sucker some other idiot into paying you for it. last man holding loses.
709 2018-07-03 16:43:04 Micron blocked from selling certain chips in China. China learning that going after tech stocks via trade retaliation is a very effective strategy as Trumps Achilles heel is Tech stock valuations. Put tariffs on iPhone imports and watch Trump fold. @jessefelder @htsfhickey

715 2018-07-03 16:40:39 Yes, you can apply price action to all type of charts, stocks included :)
716 2018-07-03 16:40:22 @realDonaldTrump how bout those red stocks. You do realize that in the stock market red=losing, green=gaining? Stop the tariffs and negotiate
717 2018-07-03 16:39:26 He never pumps bro..are you in his chatroom? He also never alerts low float stocks. He tells in the chat room like after it has moved 0.50 cents or more. If you aren't in his room, you should join. Its totally worth it. :-)

724 2018-07-03 16:35:30 Really don't think it will be a problem finding good growth stocks to buy if the market gets going. $CVNA $LGND $VRTX ? many specialty retailers, etc. But best to wait for confirmation the uptrend is resuming given some abnormal action seen last week, imo.
725 2018-07-03 16:35:08 Hmm, I wonder if there is a workable stock market strategy based on those decisions. But would probably only involve betting against (shorting) stocks.
726 2018-07-03 16:34:28 The nature of market psychology suggests that any given trend may be more indicative of market sentiment than of fundamental gains or losses in the value of stocks.#neuromarketing

731 2018-07-03 16:32:01 BTW record stocks means record amounts of money NOT in circulation and not in the hands of average Americans. Stock are 80% owned by the top 10%

737 2018-07-03 16:30:00 The @ADP Report is a reading of private job creations. This number will be a reasonably good predictor of Friday’s #JobReport. This means that if the reading is strong, like 180,000, #Stocks will likely ride higher at the expense of #Mortgage Bonds. #investments

759 2018-07-03 16:15:31 So now Trump's super elite base can see the future? They were disappointed with a move in 2018 and stopped buying in 2017. Granted WE could see the future, that his tax cuts would lead to Harley, etc. buying back stocks and moving manufacturing despite Trump's claims otherwise.

915 2018-07-03 14:57:12 May sound counter-intuitive, but IF you a $TSLA Bull, you have to really like the stock selling off this hard on amazingly positive news. The first time Musk has actually delivered on a target. Why. Because this is what good LT stocks do. Sell the news and Buy the dips.
916 2018-07-03 14:56:57 What is wrong with me?  Caught myself daydreaming about stocks in public squares - with a big smile on my face...  so wicked...
917 2018-07-03 14:56:37 Turn all of your AR-15's and Bump Stocks in and maybe the Pro-Choice will change it's mind. 

It's not your womb, it's not your business.
918 2018-07-03 14:56:31 Again, the only reason the stock market hasn't collapsed yet is because corporations are using all the money trump took from us to give to them to buy back their own stocks. As the deficit explodes. We are so f***ed.
919 2018-07-03 14:56:02 Agree totally. Even where Smartmeter installation is possible, existing stocks not compatible with switching suppliers. Hope your dumb meter is now sorted. It took a year for water co to replace my water meter when the meter reader broke it!

922 2018-07-03 14:55:15 The S&P 500 is cap weighted so the movement of its biggest stocks will dominate total return by defn. Apple explaining more change than bottom 300 is expected yet offered as an example of long tails. Are you saying big companies are in long tail of size distribution?

929 2018-07-03 14:52:35 We need to fact check everything you say Mr. President! Do you really think what you have said is the whole truth? Why are you interfering so much in a ‘free market”?  Which of your billionaire  friends are you supporting?  Those who can make a fortune every time you tank stocks?
930 2018-07-03 14:51:57 I wonder why they don't teach you how to day trade or how to properly trade stocks and bonds in school

939 2018-07-03 14:49:09 Real estate investing is more complicated than investing in stocks because of the financial and extensive due diligence requirements involved.

What is the worst advice you've ever received on real estate investing?
940 2018-07-03 14:49:05 I don't even understand what upgrading to a price lower than it's currently trading means!

We need some standards around upgrading and downgrading stocks!
941 2018-07-03 14:49:02 I hold #SML which has been oversold like many other stocks during June. Tough Month for many I think.

It's the Nature of Investing - I'm taking a long view as I'm positive Leigh Creek copper will reward holders.  Plenty of exploration upside could also be realised nearer term.

943 2018-07-03 14:48:40 U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday, boosted by energy stocks as oil prices rose, but gains were capped by a drop in technology stocks, with Facebook sliding on renewed concerns over its data scandal.

959 2018-07-03 14:44:39 The only reason the stock market hasn't collapsed yet is because corporations are using $$ trump gifted them in the tax cut scam to buy back their own stocks. They sit on rest rather than pay workers a living wage. Dems can run on this issue alone and win!

That sounds very bad for business even if you are the largest retailer. I’m checking my stocks now and watching your actions for a possible quick sell

The war is going quite well for us. Though the heat is at times unbearable, we remain in good spirits. The good folks that we have liberated are generously replenishing our super soaker stocks. We do need more macaroni salad, though.

Deficit is growing, ur tariff war made my roof cost $10,000 more, GDP isn't so hot (u lied), in fact economic indicators (not scripted for photo ops) indicate trouble ahead.  So who r beneficiarie

1323 2018-07-03 11:20:08 I think it could be quite a difference on some Stocks etc. If limit to 20× Leverage it will mean Index Trades in particular need hugely more Margin - at moment it's about 0.5% Margin on S&P500 so 200x Leverage.

1340 2018-07-03 11:14:29 These are well known over owned stocks .. with market expections that what happened in past will continue in future, since not everything is Hdfc as it's an exception to the norm, I don't seek comfort in these over followed stocks.

1343 2018-07-03 11:13:17 Deficit borrowing is up 84% since Trump took office. Stocks are in the red for 2018 and have been down since #GOPTaxScam. The trade war is hurting farmers. The Dollar value and labor participation are down. Wages are stagnant. Gas & healthcare costs are up. Job growth is slowing.
1344 2018-07-03 11:10:08 Any gains in stocks this year were lost because of tweets about tariffs.
1345 2018-07-03 11:08:50 Thats generally what you'd expect on speculative stocks no?

If you want a sure thing go trade pips on blue chips 

Obviously theres hurdles but i rather see them as potential gains

1665 2018-07-03 06:59:54 Hey Jayden! Nothing to confirm on our end. We'd recommend getting in quick if there is something that you have your eye on as these sales are strictly while stocks last.
1666 2018-07-03 06:58:49 Yesterday, I saw in early trading a 1% drop in the value of tech stocks and decided it was time to re-enter Amazon trading. The rationale was that Amazon will have sustained market value even through recession as it is significantly more competitive.
1667 2018-07-03 06:58:47 Asian #stocks were mixed once again on Tuesday, with trade worries continuing to weigh on markets.

 Banks- can shut you out of your own monies at their choosing.
Commodities/stocks- Can crash/can go to 0/or lose immense value (Lehman/enron/etc)
Crypto- BTC id say would be a closer second to RE but crypto in for the most part speculative.
Can definitely go to 0...or close.

1728 2018-07-03 05:56:26 I think it's just different phases of the same thing. Japan's stocks were lower than their economy could support, so they opened their society and up flows. Denmark's stocks expanded beyond what conservatives would tolerate, so they shut flows and persecute those already there.

1742 2018-07-03 05:46:12 Those rising stocks were due to Obama's fiscal year, which ended October 2017. Fiscal years do not end at the same time as presidential years. For someone who claims to know so much about economics, you seem unaware of that basic fact.

1751 2018-07-03 05:38:43 One other distinctive thing about stocks is the Junior Market, they make it much easier to do a public listing here, so you'll see smaller companies than you'd ever see publicly listed overseas.

1835 2018-07-03 04:19:26 Investors beware of China dominated stocks !!!
1836 2018-07-03 04:19:16 If the markets won’t go down, they go up.  And vice versa.  While I think we are still headed down, a lot of stocks are at such lows that the market can’t go down further without a substantial rally first.
1837 2018-07-03 04:18:17 This really is great information. Makes you wonder: are those 10 stocks going to fall under bed?
Or will it pull the market to new highs? Idk.
1838 2018-07-03 04:17:50 Markets are pricing in two worrisome things:

1) Trade war is confirmed.
2) China govt's inability to manage the yuan properly.

This was behind China stocks' decline today (and China co's listed in HK). Markets can get a lot worse.
1839 2018-07-03 04:17:25 So, what’s going to give? These stocks fall under bed? Or market gains some footing and rallies? Your thoughts?

Isn’t it normal though for usually a group of stocks to make up the majority of the gains of the stock market over time?

1889 2018-07-03 03:31:10 Investors need to pay close attention to this argument about short sellers and their use of the SEC whistleblower program to bet against stocks. This is only going to get worse with people trying to rip-off high-income investor's accounts. This is a very disturbing trend

1893 2018-07-03 03:28:33 It’s not that bad. A carefully chosen set of stocks should do better than FD. And these times come and go just that you have to ride them through. Good solid FMCG names and the best private banks will do ok. 

Btw which bank have you done your FD in?

U.S. stocks reversed early losses to trade higher on light volume yesterday as investors looked past potentially rising global trade tensions to focus on tech strength.
The yield on 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 2.87 percent.

1905 2018-07-03 03:16:38 A one time bonus versus a PERMANENT tax cut for the rich that SHE will be paying for. Meanwhile the rich are buying back stocks, laying off workers, shifting production overseas, and cutting programs from which she benefits. You can't fix this level of stupid.
1906 2018-07-03 03:15:26 That's why I always ran away from stocks.. While in FD ur returns donot backtrack
1907 2018-07-03 03:15:02 Make good decisions.  Don't spend 150k on education, waste of money, when state-uni costs a fraction.  Save and buy assets, stocks, land, regulatory monopolies that extract rent from other people's labor. Working doesn't make you rich, buying assets bit by bit makes you rich.

1923 2018-07-03 03:11:12 70% of businesses have used the tax cut to buy back stocks. SAD!
1924 2018-07-03 03:09:15 Only experience is 55 years of investing. The answer to that depends a lot on what’s happened in the recent past. But here’s a simple rule of thumb: The higher the recent returns, the lower the future returns, and vice versa. Stocks are tough. But i am happy.

1935 2018-07-03 02:55:09 Mr. President-Here's ideas for tax cuts 2.0. Allow companies to deduct dividends paid to shareholders. Encourage investors to buy stocks. Markets will soar! Also let consumers deduct credit card interest charges. Encourage consumer spending! Also close carried interest loophole!
1936 2018-07-03 02:52:31 Isn’t that called buying stocks. Not funds. Stocks.
1937 2018-07-03 02:50:59 There is a correlation.  I can post a chart tomorrow.  You can think of it like the SPX and US Tech stocks.  Keep in mind the Hang Seng was closed the day before so this is a bit of a catch up.

1949 2018-07-03 02:37:15 I know ERP makes sense when buying individual stocks, but do you think it could become questionable if index funds dominate? 2.8% t-bills vs a 4% S&P earnings yield just seems silly. What are your thoughts?
1950 2018-07-03 02:37:04 @xelan_gta have you seen this? So they have a bear market in stocks and now their currency is losing strength vs cad. The falling stock market may force some to sell their foreign investments to cover stock losses. The plot thickens

1965 2018-07-03 02:21:15 I thought cannabis stocks peaked around 2014-2016. Why is there still so much hype around an easily grown plant? 
1966 2018-07-03 02:21:03 I disagree.  Weeklies in high-volume stocks with market events should be 100% of one’s speculative portfolio.
1967 2018-07-03 02:20:51 Totally forgot I had Tom help me buy stocks this past weekend when I was drunk. I invested in GoPro. Don’t know but I got an email today saying I made $3. So looks like quitting my day job/retiring is coming a lot sooner than I thought.

1974 2018-07-03 02:14:16 Perhaps condom stocks will be going up?
1975 2018-07-03 02:12:48 Two little positive things for Indian stock market

1) US bond yield - trading at 2.86 which is far below from 3 indocates that rates in US may not rise quickly due to global turmoil 

2) Brokerages - more upgrades as compared to downgrades in equity stocks
1976 2018-07-03 02:12:36 83% of stocks are held by 1% of the population. The stock market  has very little impact on your average citizens day to day life. It constantly went up under Obama, and it didn't matter. Goes up under Trump, guess what? It still doesn't matter to most people. It's not the growth

1984 2018-07-03 02:04:41 How many stocks do you watch and trade daily?
1985 2018-07-03 02:01:39 But either way it’s math, not an opinion. The only time to not diversify is if covering too many stocks or coins 1) hurts your ability to identify the best similar opportunities 2) hurts your ability to transfer those ideas in your portfolio ...
1986 2018-07-03 02:00:48 I’ve not once said I want everyone to give up their guns. Sensible gun laws in addition to ones that exist. Red Flag laws, parents going to jail when they don’t lock up guns and their brats shoot up schools, ban AR-15s, ban bump stocks, background checks re: mental health.
1987 2018-07-03 02:00:26 One of my local shops only stocks standard stuff. There's literally no reason to ever step foot in there.

2027 2018-07-03 01:28:51 Technically the guns are still semi autos... bump stocks just increase the trigger pull rate...
2028 2018-07-03 01:28:10 Not true. The NRA works to obstruct anything that blocks gun sales, like universal background checks, raising the minimum age to purchase a firearm to 21, banning military style assault rifles and bump stocks. All sensible legislation but reduces profits. And all without insults.
2029 2018-07-03 01:27:49 Bump stocks simulate a full-auto rate of fire, but it is still one trigger squeeze = one bullet (aka semi-automatic).

I can create the same effect as a bump stock with my finger and belt loop

Eugene Stoner did not invent the semi-automatic rifle. There were MANY before the AR15

2047 2018-07-03 01:10:40 You could have just bought the stocks and then when a stock got kicked out,  you would sell it and then buy the one that replaced it.   Probably not very efficient to execute back then, but better than not being in stocks.
