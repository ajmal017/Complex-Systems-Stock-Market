2 2018-07-26 23:59:48 Thanks for reminding me that i'm over due for sending a donation to @HarleyRouda. Also I'm pretty sure it was in Dana's district where I stepped on oil globs that had washed up on the beach from the oil wells in socal in April. Not related to the topic but still feels fitting.

6 2018-07-26 23:59:27 I didn’t realise Pence had ties...I thought it was because those asshats Hatch and Bishop want to sell the land for oil and gas.
7 2018-07-26 23:59:08 Tea tree oil or witch hazel works wonders
8 2018-07-26 23:59:07 You do know that oil is on its way out. Renewable energy is in.
9 2018-07-26 23:59:04 Don’t like gas prices? Just build your own oil company. This is America.
10 2018-07-26 23:58:54 America has taken advantage of the world for far longer, look at any middle eastern state that wants to stop selling oil in American dollars and wants to bring back the gold standard
11 2018-07-26 23:58:27 Have you ever listened to a complete fucking idiot talk and wonder to yourself,how the fuck are you still alive?????

13 2018-07-26 23:58:12 Striking Abu Dhabi airport & attacking oil tankers in Red Sea not victory. But both things expose failure of Saudi-led coalition & how its intervention has become disastrous, not only for humanitarian situation in Yemen, but also security & economic interests of Saudis & Emiratis

15 2018-07-26 23:58:06 All of our universities stress oil when talking about engineering. But we have some great civil engineering programs, too. Emphasize them. And also talk about jobs like surveying in high school. Not just oil, oil, oil.
16 2018-07-26 23:58:06 I think he’s got things right, and gets that the molecules (e.g. oil) people now regard as useful were often more plentiful in the past. And, he gets that this didn’t matter, because they didn’t know that stuff existed, or even how to use it.
17 2018-07-26 23:58:00 Neem oil is what I use.
18 2018-07-26 23:57:55 Tomatoes & fresh basil. Nothing better. Hope u got a good oil & balsamic.

40 2018-07-26 23:57:44 Not at all. Iran is the enemy of Saudi Arabia. Who provide a lot of money and oil to the US. NK is a Chinese alley and potential nuclear power with a nut job for a leader. Disrupting Chinese power is worth more than the potential of a NK bank.
41 2018-07-26 23:57:31 From ‘14 to ‘16 OPEC did product dumping through oversupply to damage American oil economy. 100 co’s bankrupt in TX. More than 200k working Americans lost their jobs. @SenatorCharles said and did nothing. Now that US oil jobs are back GOP wants to kill recovery. #NOPEC is a joke.
42 2018-07-26 23:57:29 Tonight, my groom just learned the very painful lesson that spraying a brand new pizza stone with olive oil is NOT the same as properly seasoning it. I’m trying really hard not to be exceedingly smug. #IWarnedHim
43 2018-07-26 23:57:25 We need an oil sugar daddy like Chelski.

49 2018-07-26 23:56:32 You know, if they called it "egg custard & olive oil" instead of "mayonnaise", no one would bat an eye.
50 2018-07-26 23:56:24 They’ll bomb Saudi oil. This is all really unnecessary and it’s a purposefully created distraction from domestic problems just as Putin’s invasion of Crimea was
51 2018-07-26 23:56:19 i’m think i’m like 1000 miles overdue for an oil change... who let me own a car

56 2018-07-26 23:55:42 If more people acted in this way they could make the correction less disastrous. Everyone get your solar power, olive oil. rice and beans and elk jerky.
57 2018-07-26 23:55:35 This guy Deblasio has got to be one of the biggest hypocrites in history....wasting tax payer money on a useless lawsuit if oil is the problem stop using it lets go back horse and buggy oh wait he hates that too
58 2018-07-26 23:55:10 Weed! CBD oil is great.
59 2018-07-26 23:55:09 @DianeBlackTN you are a prostitute for the NRA, big oil, Vladimir Putin, Russia..you may not have to provide BJs  but you sell out our democracy in return for money. You are worse than a street walker!
60 2018-07-26 23:55:05 Could have just stayed in MA and had spinach with flaxseed oil. But VT is prettier.
61 2018-07-26 23:55:04 know what would be better? 
Let resource industries workers in mining, forestry, oil & gas keep their good paying jobs beyond age 40 or 50. Don’t have an environment minister that goes for coffee with a group of her girl friends to decide that too many men on a project is a bad!
62 2018-07-26 23:54:35 THAT MUH ESSENTIAL OIL AND YOU CANT SMELL IT?

68 2018-07-26 23:53:57 All that for my face, but just hemp seed oil with moisturizer for the rest of my body
69 2018-07-26 23:53:50 'Textured Vegetable Protein' is Soy. 
90% of all 'Vegetable Oil' is Soy. 

There are Estrogen precursors in damn near everything. The Ancient Romans poisoned themselves with lead. Is the American Experiment crumbling under the weight of Soy? 

70 2018-07-26 23:53:36 I just this minute finished breast screen . 6 years Low Carb to ZC. Perfect scan! Technician said remarkably good tissue. No veg oil for sooo long! Yay!

See, this is why white people are considered boring.

73 2018-07-26 23:53:10 Also do not mix / blend homemade hot sauce inside your house, wear eye protection, and gloves. 

Whatever you do, don't rub your recently splattered eyes with your pepper oil covered fingers in a kitchen full of the equivalent of pepper spray. 

It makes for a bad day
74 2018-07-26 23:53:06 @ChristianMThack did you get that beard oil?

81 2018-07-26 23:51:47 i also use rockabye baby oil, and thank you
82 2018-07-26 23:51:44 I mix it with regular moisturizer, and then add a drop of lavender and tea tree oil and my skin has gotten sooooo nice
83 2018-07-26 23:51:22 Interesting, but intercepting Chinese vessels carrying Iranian oil would be highly contentious. Regardless, Iran mixes their oil with Iraqi oil to get around sanctions anyway.
84 2018-07-26 23:50:45 When it’s hot/humid like this, cucumber, tomato, crumbled feta, salt, pepper, balsamic vinegar, and a little bit of olive oil is perfect.
85 2018-07-26 23:50:43 Learn from me. I always ignored those calls and didn’t check the oil. Lost my first car when it blew up last year. RIP my GMC Terrain.
86 2018-07-26 23:50:30 It's the move called "Checking the Oil" that'll REALLY send up some red flags...
87 2018-07-26 23:50:15 it's the socialism you pick when you just can't stomach the oil pipelines, environmental destruction, and rampant mistreatment of indigenous populations done by evil bad socialists like the USSR
88 2018-07-26 23:50:11 hemp seed oil bb it’s life changing

94 2018-07-26 23:49:29 Holy fuck, CBD oil on my shoulder muscles is a life saver. Also, I don't recommend sneezing or coughing with sore abs, either. A fiasco will be had.
95 2018-07-26 23:49:24 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
96 2018-07-26 23:49:18 だって、あんなにリピートしてたじゃないですか( ´∀｀)

という冗談はさておき、笑顔から真顔からプンプンしたところまで、推しがあれだけ色んな表情見せてくれてたら、楽しそうに見えますよ。
97 2018-07-26 23:49:14 Gun oil, spit
98 2018-07-26 23:49:08 My mom, after 16 years, don’t know shit about my hair texture at all. Sis really thinks my hair will get less puffy if I only put some oil in it. Oil??? White people get on my nerves man...
99 2018-07-26 23:49:03 I called for an appointment to get an oil change at 4pm. It is not 4:48 and my car is still parked out front
100 2018-07-26 23:48:52 wait, are you talking about fresh made onion rings?  Because that oil stays hot and it is NOT a good lubricant.
101 2018-07-26 23:48:38 They’re free, just go to the beach and coat yourself with fish oil or maybe a cut that bleeds some you can attract them and feed any shark that comes at you. #SharkWeek
102 2018-07-26 23:48:35 Roasted Brussel sprouts tossed with olive oil salt/ pepper
103 2018-07-26 23:48:27 Get an oil change, too; the auto industry is in for a rocky ride. Tariffs won't just directly impact the cost of raw materials to build the vehicles, but will affect *every* layer of production right back to the molds and dies used to produce the stamped panels and plastic parts.
104 2018-07-26 23:48:16 If you’re looking for more options for things to eat that are also supper easy to cool my mom made cabbage ‘steaks’ basically you slice up cabbage and put them on a cookie sheet with olive oil and salt and pepper and it’s amazing you can do the same with asparagus
105 2018-07-26 23:48:14 1 in 4 people take fish oil supplements. Hype or science driven?Humans are the only living organism that accepts good enough. A tree will grow as big as it can, bees make as much honey as they can, people settle for good enough.
106 2018-07-26 23:48:03 I went to school in Glasgow 1965-71 then to Glasgow Uni 1971-81. I just thought all cities were like that. Looking back, that was when the oil started to flow and our prosperity should have been assured. Hardly a speck of dirt on Oslo's streets now.
107 2018-07-26 23:48:00 Man that damn omega oil would have you on your ass frfr at a south party!
108 2018-07-26 23:47:57 VIA @Halsrethink   It is possible Australian news was used to leak threat to Iran, as backdrop to possible intensified US actions such as imposition of  strong sanctions on all public or private entities buying Iran oil. Whatever contemplated along these lines, will not end well.

110 2018-07-26 23:47:35 The nest time you purchase olive oil from the supermarket and they ask if you would like a bag respond with "no, I'm just going to drink it now".
111 2018-07-26 23:47:19 And they actually believe that the Republican majority & Trump are going to HONOR any agreement to put the oil drilling money back into the Park Service & conservation efforts? Or do they think we’re gullible enough to?

Where I come from, we call that “selling out“…
112 2018-07-26 23:47:18 since i stopped using tea tree oil my skin hasnt been irritated
113 2018-07-26 23:46:53 We can't wait to hear all about your experience with this oil!
114 2018-07-26 23:46:48 I beat the piss out of my old civic. Changed the oil and had no problems. Kinda dogged my last corolla and just changed the oil. Again no problems. I get a F150 for 6 months and this POS breaks down twice now #JDM4Life

120 2018-07-26 23:46:00 Also fund holistic/ natural health especialy for ppl who cannot afford eg medical cbd or cannabis oil
121 2018-07-26 23:45:40 This make so many of us angry, what is wrong with the executives of the oil companies that they can't see what their actions will do to yet another species about to become extinct on their watch !
Greed, a lack of Empathy and a constant drive for more money, this is pathetic !
122 2018-07-26 23:45:38 There is not enough oil off our coast to really warrant drilling.  But, if there is a drop to find, risk polluting SC waters/beaches. Tourists will love looking at oil rigs. Jeez!  (My sarcastic rant!)
123 2018-07-26 23:45:37 I need a damn oil change
124 2018-07-26 23:45:19 Only chump I see is you. Where's my oil credit app

126 2018-07-26 23:45:13 Call Rs They will say they are "modernizing" it. NOT TRUE. There are 6 riders & 1 bill that devastates it-backed by oil, mining, 45, Rs $ & #ZinkeResign.

127 2018-07-26 23:45:11 I switched to organic deodorant. My pits lightened up in color and I don’t have that film that a solid deodorant leaves. I remember one summer two years ago I got by just using coconut oil. No odor, no sweat.
128 2018-07-26 23:45:06 organic or oil base grease ?
129 2018-07-26 23:44:53 okay I'm not a doctor or herbalist or beautician... but what I do as my face tonic, fill a misting bottle with half clear vodka, half water and a few drops essential oil. maybe that could work for you too?!  :D
130 2018-07-26 23:44:39 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes
131 2018-07-26 23:44:34 $BHP’s sale of its U.S. shale oil assets is yet another reminder of how appalling the company’s management has been over the long term. It’s scary to total how much shareholder’s capital has been torched by ambitious directors over the decades. #BHP
132 2018-07-26 23:44:31 as for your original point it failed because it was based on the faulty premise that we did not need to transport oil so there was no need to consider relative risks. That point was thoroughly debunked many tweets ago.
133 2018-07-26 23:44:21 Bahri said it was a VLCC. Aramco doubled the number. Which story sounds better if you’re long oil?
134 2018-07-26 23:44:10 Ignorant mentality that squeezed every drop of oil back in the day & didn’t develop any other industry (unlike our west neighbors) Also, the same thinking that got sports betting vetoed. The leadership is obviously satisfied being last in everything

138 2018-07-26 23:43:22 The banks don’t do it the most. The US invaded Iraq for oil. The EU Libya for the same reason. The crusades were for gold. The Romans for food, gold and power,
139 2018-07-26 23:43:13 Tea tree oil has changed my life it is over for u bitches
140 2018-07-26 23:43:11 Yes. I use organic/free range. It'll make a bit over a cup. If you want it thinner, add more oil. Some recipes call for a cup of oil. Because nothing is pasteurised (unlike store stuff) you do have to consume it quickly.
141 2018-07-26 23:42:47 Good to know.There is at least some evidence #ShellKnew #ExonKnew Big Oil had climate change science 30 yrs ago & rather than diversify they funded denial think tanks & networks. Some investors claim fraud, U.S. West Coast cities are suing
142 2018-07-26 23:42:37 Nope California has a desire for both heavy and light crudes and has a particular need to a new stream of heavy oil as the California heavy oil fields are running dry and the refineries built to refine heavy oil need new inputs. This is why they are looking so closely at Alberta
143 2018-07-26 23:42:18 idc how tired i am .. ima clean my car out in the morning and get a oil change before work
144 2018-07-26 23:42:12 If Bitcoin is considered a commodity i don't see why it can't be any different than any other ETF regarding gold or oil. But then again I would never buy Bitcoin. ETF or not.
145 2018-07-26 23:42:11 @afreedma Not a double-blind study, but vaping really did help my son quit smoking.  He titrated the amount of nicotine and also mixed in CBD oil until he stopped.  He’s now stopped vaping too.

So if you had no oil or plastic inputs at your firm in '71, you still see gold and then oil skyrocketing as probably coming to get you soon. Maybe you make pizzas. By '73 you are seeing wheat and tomatoes finally get u

156 2018-07-26 23:39:43 He also didn't want someone in office that would encourage US production of oil and gas to compete with Russia's #1 export.

His primary goal in social media meddling was to sew division amongst Americans. In this, he's been WILDLY successful.
157 2018-07-26 23:39:24 According to the newest EIA Drilling Productivity Report, the top five U.S. shale oil fields' monthly decline rate is set to surpass 500,000 barrels per day in August. New production must offset that just to keep production flat.
158 2018-07-26 23:39:21 I remain ignorant? This is entirely your fault Michael because you have not yet answered my question. Why do Central American Migrants bypass an oil rich republic like Mexico and not ask for asylum in hopes of living with a bunch of vile white suprecacists?
159 2018-07-26 23:38:59 How is this statement powering the future? When its preventing progress oil is a finite resource it will runout it is temporary if u were 4 the future u wud see that renewable energy tech is where the future lies. Not just an advocate but financing across the globe says the same
160 2018-07-26 23:38:52 @olive_oil have you watched castle rock?
161 2018-07-26 23:38:51 Further thought though . Not defending KSA but compared to Venezuela at least on simply producing oil and exporting it ( their job) they manage that Maduro doesn’t manage that so everyone in Ven goes hungry not just regime opponents.
162 2018-07-26 23:38:48 I got my nails done today. She used an actual kitchen grater on my heels, then rubbed my feet with what appeared to be olive oil, & finally tenderized my legs by beating them with her fists for five minutes.

I must confess I feared I was being prepared to be roasted for dinner.
163 2018-07-26 23:38:31 Australia doesn’t really do charismatic inspiring politicians We’re a low key kind of people suspicious of populist messiahs & snake oil salesmen Keating Whitlam had pretty short tenures in the top job they’re probably top of the pops in the charisma stakes
164 2018-07-26 23:38:21 The investors arent touching Canada cause of trudeaus regulations and gender crap. Sustainable energy isn't that big and doesn't employ as many as you're making it out to be. Plus a lot of sustainable energy is actually worse for the environment than oil due to mining
165 2018-07-26 23:38:14 Yes your scalp produces it’s own oils. I hadnt put any oil or grease product in my hair since high school. Hated having oily heavy hair lol
166 2018-07-26 23:38:10 Put room temperature egg at bottom of tall, narrow measuring jug. Add a lemon, garlic and other flavours. Fill the rest with a nice oil up to 1 cup mark. When oil settles, put blender in down to bottom of jug. Put speed setting on max. Turn it on. It'll make thick, delicious mayo

Oil could be back to US$45 a barrel within 12 months, Citigroup’s commodities chief Ed Morse said in an interview with the Financial Post, noting that the bullish case for crude is based on a faulty analysis.
169 2018-07-26 23:37:46 Notice that Murray Edwards didn't have the nerve to put his own name on contributions. Remember too that he was a BC Liberal bagman who raised huge sums from Calgary based oil and gas companies.  #bcpoli

171 2018-07-26 23:37:15 Trump and his supporters railed against wind energy, claiming it kills birds.  Now Trump and GOP want to repeal Endangered Species Act, which saved many species, including Bald Eagle, from extinction.  But it doesn't make money for Gas, Oil or Mining Industries, so it has to go.

180 2018-07-26 23:35:09 I think he's wrong about that. A natural thing is only a "resource" if the knowledge exists of how to use it. So, for example, there exist more energy resources today than during those times. Crude oil wasn't a natural resource *to them* because they didn't know HOW it was.
181 2018-07-26 23:35:05 Gasoline & Diesel- Pick your poison  C02, diesel particulate, smog, PCB in motor oil etc. a culmination of these items harm our environment and lead to increased incidents of Asthma and well, there’s that little thing called climate change... my goal is to stop using Gasoline

189 2018-07-26 23:34:12 It's pointing out that it's not a new concept, and the oil industry is threatened by said concept. So these investors got rid of him so he didn't act further.

192 2018-07-26 23:33:09 Sustainable energy has grown because the market is there for it. It’s a big commodity, and employs lots of people. Regardless of the market for oil, many are working their way out of it and towards other energy sources including investors who wouldn’t touch Canada.
193 2018-07-26 23:32:55 there's all sorts of hazards, and you'll figure out how to manipulate them. Spilled oil to the flame, electricity to water, that sort of thing.

199 2018-07-26 23:32:21 A small lesson in common sense: the amount of oil produced by American companies in USA using US workers is a response to current oil price. If oil goes down, wells get plugged, workers lose their jobs, companies go bankrupt and land owners lose their royalties. “Ripped off”?
200 2018-07-26 23:31:35 I just made the most amazing chicken and noodle salad. The dressing was incredible. Evoo, oyster sauce, soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, sesame oil. Banging! Im just sad theres none left.
201 2018-07-26 23:31:18 The war in Iraq was all about oilman Dick Cheny and the Iraqi oil. Look at how much money Halliburton subsidiaries made on that war. Look at how much money Eric Prince and Blackwater made. They knew there were no WMDs in Iraq. The pack of them should have been tried at The Hague.

208 2018-07-26 23:30:09 Ate the french fries prepared with a fryer that only used one spoonful of oil. I am not convinced these still deserve the name of french fries since they aren't crusty and don't taste the same.

Still ate my part.
209 2018-07-26 23:29:51 Oil is benifical. It's at an all time high in consumption and not going away for a long, long time. It pays for many benifits we receive in Canada. Pays to clean water and things like that. Agree to disagree
210 2018-07-26 23:29:48 If you are a bread baker, try this: 3 cups flour (+ for kneading), pack of yeast in 1 cup warm water w/ 3 tbs sugar, 1 tbs salt, 2 tbs thyme, 2 tbs rosemary, 2 tbs cracked black pepper, 3 tbs olive oil. Mix, Knead, rise 90 min, braid, rise 60 min, bake at 425 30 min. Awesome!

231 2018-07-26 23:25:42 Exactly.  At least someone besides me understands common sense supply and demand. High oil prices are what will drive R&D$$$ towards green alrernatives (in addition to creating US jobs in the short run).

242 2018-07-26 23:24:21 you ignore everything to assert your assertion. doesn't change the fact that Canada spends the most per capita of any G7 country on oil & gas production, with very little transparency on those subsidies. alberta's corporate socialism experiment has cost & will cost us all dearly
243 2018-07-26 23:23:39 Hey well and start that fish oil
244 2018-07-26 23:23:37 This is literally nonsensical babble. Cheap oil is caused by global oversupply. Cheap oil = cheap gas. Cheap gas = less interest in green alternatives, more interest in cheap fuel. Cheap fuel costs are not only bad for US oil jobs, but bad for environment.
245 2018-07-26 23:23:24 yoi sound like motor rgat needs oil! whining all the time
246 2018-07-26 23:23:23 $BHP has sold its US onshore oil assets for US$10.8b to BP. Proceeds to be paid in instalments over 6 mths.

Iran can target population centers by making the Dimona ruble bounce when surface winds are favorable.
Dimona should NOT be thought of as a one&done situation

The only reason anyone talks about attacking Iran is, to make the price of oil go up, nothing else.
258 2018-07-26 23:21:59 Realized my face is not oily-dry combo anymore. It's more like a combo of everything type of skin.

269 2018-07-26 23:20:11 Here is how oil works: USA is the 3rd highest producer on Earth. When oil price goes down, American oil workers lose their jobs and wells get plugged. When oil price is up, American oil workers have jobs and green energy gets $$$. Oil is not a zero sum game with Russia and OPEC.

276 2018-07-26 23:19:13 i smelled bad while leaving work n tried to be smart by slathering myself with peppermint essential oil but it immediately backfired by making my armpits burn like a goddam wildfire ... and i still smell weird
277 2018-07-26 23:18:52 We all know u have to build energy to use it. Stop oil drilling
278 2018-07-26 23:18:49 Totally agree we don’t withhold opioids because of the misuse of heroin and many children and adults with various debilitating conditions and illnesses should have benefited from cannabis oil a long time ago. I’m so relieved! Sending prayers for your friend and her husband 
279 2018-07-26 23:18:39 See beta Engine oil
Why cut short a good story
That's how people lose their real husbands 
For fear of being oiled
280 2018-07-26 23:18:13 my entire face is burning because of this tea tree oil, it better be working 
281 2018-07-26 23:18:13 You know that we're losing a battle within. 
Spent all that money on oil & war.
Well, there's not much left to pay off our sins.
282 2018-07-26 23:18:13 There's no better time for our Summer Roll with tuna, yellowtail, green pepper, and avocado. It also has masago, cilantro, sesame chili oil, and fresh lime for unique summertime flavors

283 2018-07-26 23:18:04 When your basil is ready, swap out the peppers and tahini for a huge handful of basil and olive oil. The baba possibilities are endless out here in the fields!
284 2018-07-26 23:18:04 You all have been misled. Like our over-reliance on oil you people don't like good things.
285 2018-07-26 23:17:51 I just use jojoba oil with nothing else! It actually takes my liquid eyeliner right off, which is my favorite part since I really had to scrub with most makeup removers or face washes.
286 2018-07-26 23:17:36 ~6 years low and zero carb. No veg oil... just had breast sonogram! Perfect! ( I don’t opt for radiation!) she said tissue is remarkably good. @SBakerMD @tednaiman @TuckerGoodrich
287 2018-07-26 23:17:32 omg I have super itchy sunburn too. if you have peppermint essential oil (100% pure) it really helps.
288 2018-07-26 23:17:27 Just put my garlic bulb in the oven with the olive oil, salt & pepper inside it.

Last time I made this mac-n-cheese dish, I sauteed the garlic as I didn't have any foil to roast it in. We'll see how it turns out this way!
289 2018-07-26 23:17:18 @DianeBlackTN you are a special interest NRA, big oil, whore..you are selling out the health and safety of your constituents for $$$ SHAME ON YOU! $70 million gains over your time in congress!#dems2018 #dems2020

291 2018-07-26 23:17:07 the net impact of tesla is more negative than positive, but please continue to defend a megalomaniac who calls people pedophiles for no reason because you're incapable of separating the oil industry from anyone else being bad and you think he's iron man

293 2018-07-26 23:16:55 Dude. You are killing American oil industry jobs with your ignorant NOPEC nonsense. Go back to promoting subsidized corn ethanol or whatever it is that they make in Iowa and stay out of the American oil business please.

295 2018-07-26 23:16:09 In addition to higher oil prices catching them off-guard, it may have been a mistake giving access to so many free seats
296 2018-07-26 23:15:49 SAME I use a biotin oil and my doctor said it’s because it’s making your skin purge so it’s one of those “it’s gonna get worse before it gets better” scenarios but idc I’m still mad
297 2018-07-26 23:15:47 Some vegans make no sense. Like you know those fries were cooked in the same oil as my nuggets, right?
298 2018-07-26 23:15:44 Talkin' slick like it's oil speakin'
299 2018-07-26 23:15:19 Do you understand price/supply/demand? If Russia and OPEC “make sure prices stay high” but we are producing oil in the USA that means more revenue for American oil producers and more American jobs. You are way too ignorant on the oil industry to have a cogent view.
300 2018-07-26 23:15:17 Bruh as soon as I said I quit smoking weed bc my anxiety everyone’s like “it doesn’t make anxiety worse try CBD oil.” BITCH I WANT TO STOP IN GENERAL leave me alone.

305 2018-07-26 23:14:31 Brydie accidentally poured half a bottle of eucalyptus oil in the oil burner and now my pores are so open I can taste with my skin.

313 2018-07-26 23:13:10 it’s definitely a drill not a milling tool, typically it would have coolant or cutting oil running to lubricate, cool and flush the chips from the hole

He didn't change.

322 2018-07-26 23:11:52 You are disillusioned. The US helped expel ISIS from Raqqa {& killed many civilians in the process). The US protects a Kurdish-controlled north-east of Syria, rest of Syria is Russia's. ISIS supplied Assad with oil & enjoyed support & safe passage through regime's lines.
323 2018-07-26 23:11:44 “Oh Hey fawkin”
324 2018-07-26 23:11:36 I realize that’s why I’m saying it doesn’t make sense—shoot for what commodities you can be beneficial with, like logging for fishing. We mishandled our oil industry and are planning to invest billions into a commodity which has a high risk of not paying off while not...
325 2018-07-26 23:11:35 He can’t assure anything if there are future spills from oil drilling and @SecretaryZinke rolls back protections and increases leases.  Really?  You can ask hat with a straight face? Politics.. career politicians drive me nuts.

329 2018-07-26 23:10:51 Do you put oil in your car or had a oil change recently? Is it coolant in your car? Is it leaking?

Why don’t you come down here to LA & TX to try to tell families whose income comes from the oil industry and experienced layoffs in recent years everything you are doing to create jobs for the American oil worker?!?

338 2018-07-26 23:09:52 Key takeaways:

1) political barriers primary impediment to date (bill 61, preference for oil/large hydro, etc).

2) techno-economic constraints: lack of domestic demand/export capacity

3) misinformation is rampant in NL: ‘kills birds’, ‘winds are too strong’, etc, etc.
339 2018-07-26 23:09:47 on top of what clear-cutting  forest, putting oil wells all on our Coastline & pipelines across our mountains damn up our Rivers?

341 2018-07-26 23:09:05 do not claim to be italian if you get drunk off one shot of olive oil 
342 2018-07-26 23:08:58 i was making breakfast and a lot of hot oil shot up and it all landed on my hand
343 2018-07-26 23:08:44 Is that olive oil in the middle
344 2018-07-26 23:08:37 me and carrot oil don’t mix , covered head to toe in prickly heat :)))
345 2018-07-26 23:08:27 Well I think it looks great. I'm trying a new one-pan dish tonight. Chicken breasts, red skin potatoes, French style green beans, dry Italian dressing mix sprinkled on top with a few pats of lite butter with Canola oil. Forgot to snap a pic before I put it in the oven.
346 2018-07-26 23:08:11 I really fucked myself up with the chilli oil last night
347 2018-07-26 23:08:05 Tea tree oil has done wanders for me. Love it
348 2018-07-26 23:08:02 Not much of either there, but they narrow down risk to processed foods neatly enough. Rapeseed (like Canola) is main vegetable cooking oil/fat (they have a "cooking margarine" made by Unilever, a lot used but sales are dropping)
349 2018-07-26 23:07:55 Disinformation spread by big oil so you will use more gas.  You know how those big corporations work.  Can’t believe you fell for it.
350 2018-07-26 23:07:31 It's not tit for tat. That's part of the task. Pouring oil is nothing. It's harmless. It's deepthi's foolishness to keep open her eyes. But, that's not the case with kaushal. Both kireeti & bhanu suddenly did it and it's harmful. That's a harsh treatment. No comparison at all.

355 2018-07-26 23:06:59 I have $100 in my bank account, and don't get paid until the 30th(I only get paid once a month). I need to change my oil, refill my gas tank, and pay more than half my monthly check in rent & now I have to start paying back student loans in 2 weeks.  Sugar Daddy, where u at?
356 2018-07-26 23:06:53 i'd wager the oil runoff from automobiles and asphalt into our water stream at least as toxic and bad for the environment (and at much higher volumes) as whatever bad things are in the scooter's batteries that could damage the ecosystem
357 2018-07-26 23:06:45 I was told by people I'm not supposed to know that Vietnam war was about oil. We had rigs in the Gulf of Tonkin during the 60s.
358 2018-07-26 23:06:34 I’d love a little sample. My favorites are classics, dark chocolate, chocolate-peanut butter, and pistachio - but I’ve enjoyed strange flavors like corn and olive oil before. If it’s like eating cold mayo it’d be a one-time thing tho 
359 2018-07-26 23:06:26 Oil money, in what is now called Alberta, has kept many of the Chiefs rich.

362 2018-07-26 23:05:54 Oil changed & the car clean

368 2018-07-26 23:05:10 Instead of financial risk as the focus, why can’t you ask the question about the depth of these wells & imminent danger of a Deepwater Horizon-like catastrophe?

411 2018-07-26 23:00:22 Every small business owner I talk to are doing great, the oil field workers are back to work as well as railroad workers. Just about every industry is booming. Haven't heard nothing but praise. I guess we all have our own bubbles, but TX is still a very red state.

416 2018-07-26 22:59:45 So they are wrong because those tankers did not supply the oil? Because those refineries are not able to process the oil they apparently did not receive? Those refineries don't have a desire for the oil they reported as wanting? Just wondering what errors you see in this report?
417 2018-07-26 22:59:35 ماهي لك احسك تسوقها
418 2018-07-26 22:59:32  that would suck. Lemon and peppermint oil it is then.
419 2018-07-26 22:59:31 Actually money from cap and trade went for rebates for home retrofits for solar panels and also electric cars. To say it does nothing to reduce oil and gas is ignorant of the issue.
420 2018-07-26 22:59:30 Jiffy Lube lied.. Talking about 15 min oil changes  I got stuff to do man, hurry up lol
421 2018-07-26 22:59:29 One commenter at the hearing about ORSANCO gutting their own water quality stands said he overheard one of the commissioners say “water quality shouldn’t be governed by standards” & a convo about how excited they are for the possibility for oil & gas drilling in KY.

424 2018-07-26 22:59:20 Canada’s arts & entertainment industries create 17.71 jobs per $1 million while the oil & gas industry creates 0.48 jobs per $1 million. StatsCan no’s., quoted in Darin Barney’s article in the book Petrocultures. #abpoli #cdnpoli
425 2018-07-26 22:59:12 Fact of it is: the market is set with the two players and unfortunately we don’t have the resources to counteract. That’s why refining Canadian oil makes sense, focus on our markets first.
426 2018-07-26 22:59:07 Fuckin’ A. These a-holes would mow down every single rainforest + drill for oil—even if it destroyed our source of oxygen!—to say they “owned the libs!”  #BananaRepublicans
427 2018-07-26 22:59:00 Only the slowest of two guys being chased by a bear has anything to worry about. 
Saudi oil will not meet total demand for many decades if ever. But producers who are are on the wrong side of the cost curve will fall away first.

430 2018-07-26 22:58:28 I realize that. But isn’t it strange that those eastern provinces get a majority of their oil from the Middle East as well? Doesn’t make sense. I also know we ship as far down to California and the Puget Sound, but we also have product being refined overseas as well...

432 2018-07-26 22:58:18 Well, to be honest their oil is more expensive to extract than fucking athabasca oil sands, basing the bulk of economy on it was a huuuge mistake.

444 2018-07-26 22:57:01 Fish oil become so popular despite lack of outcome data because:
1.  Lowers blood test in TG (patients and MDs like better #)
2.  Almost no toxicity except ‘financial’
3.  Good story (‘fish good for you’)

Couple of large RCTs to report out soon tho
445 2018-07-26 22:56:51 Hahahahahaha I ran out of oil at CSM smh
446 2018-07-26 22:56:43 The difference between Quebec and Alberta is..Alberta WILL clean up the tailing ponds in the oil sands while Quebec and dare I say Victoria BC will just flush their toxic waste into the ocean.  If you live in those two provinces then clean up your backyard first
447 2018-07-26 22:56:40 That oil comes from more than just fort Mac. Sask, Manitoba and alberta all pump to edmonton and its shipped out. That oil is shipped down all the way to California. The markets are dominated by those two because they have access to the markets, we don't.

479 2018-07-26 22:52:03 What happened to all the spin off from the previous oil projects here? The spin off is a total exaggeration, we've seen it time and again. It's all here today and gone tomorrow.

482 2018-07-26 22:51:52 Shocker people don't like taxes but being gouged by oil companies constantly for 5 cents a litre with low barrel prices is no big deal right. No proof it works is not a fact some of it is hard to measure but it has an effect. Funny user pay is usually a conservative tenet.

489 2018-07-26 22:50:57 Cambridge Analytica's psychographic profiling was utter fucking snake oil bullshit. Yes, I said it. The Kremlin's emotional spamming was far more effective at suppressing voter turnout than anything CA did.

492 2018-07-26 22:50:37 US Dollar unfortunately does have backing ... You can only pay for Saudi oil with the Dollar which gives it some sort of backing I would say.

505 2018-07-26 22:49:27 I would appreciate it if Mac Haik @Ford Quick-Lane in Houston on I-10 and the beltway would stop harassing me to leave a review on their oil change service. I didn’t want to leave a review the last time I got my oil changed. I don’t want to leave a review this time. Take a hint.
506 2018-07-26 22:49:23 Bonus points if he conditions his head in that Phyrexian oil stuff
507 2018-07-26 22:49:20 Instead of financial risk as the focus, why can’t you ask the question about the depth of these wells & imminent danger of a Deepwater Horizon-like catastrophe? It is so far out to sea,  stormy; where does the oil flow in a disaster? Which shores & wildlife & fisheries affected?!

537 2018-07-26 22:45:59 Obama beat down Putin and the Oligarchs in a dozen different ways, but mostly he ruined them by simply allowing an oil supply glut to drive down crude prices, being smart by taking a bit of luck and using it well. #PompeoLies
538 2018-07-26 22:45:58 Getting strapless was a tough battle with my parents. The bright colour went really well with the sunburn I got trying to tan using baby oil... 
539 2018-07-26 22:45:41 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
540 2018-07-26 22:45:12 Iran will probably nuke the major cities of Saudi Arabia in the east of SA sparing the oil fields and infrastructure of ARAMCO in the west of SA. Iran will never try that on America while @realDonaldTrump is @POTUS.
541 2018-07-26 22:45:07 The squeaky wheel gets the oil. Liberals learned that years ago.
542 2018-07-26 22:45:00 More rigs equal more jobs and more revenue for our state. New Mexico’s flourishing oil and gas industry is benefits all New Mexicans, helping us invest more in quality public schools, essential roads and highways, and critical law enforcement.
543 2018-07-26 22:44:48 I read it as a statement of the oil industry, not the vehicle.

545 2018-07-26 22:44:44 I meannnn I always sat up top at Lucas oil didn't have a problem hearing anything. I think the issue is any other competition at those venues people are put at the bottom and those aren't the best seats to hear everything
546 2018-07-26 22:44:24 Norway and Sweden are able to offset much of their cost by oil, which line in America don't want us using.  Nothing is free, everything has to be paid for.  How's Venezuela doing?
547 2018-07-26 22:44:20 It’s been stolen for as long as us Settlers have has been taking it without FN consent.

Heavy oil, bitumen especially, has always required more energy, produced more pollution, and resulted in more significant negative environmental impacts.

And I don’t support Greenpeace.
548 2018-07-26 22:44:07 Arising from Imperial Oil as well - employers better learn a little more about implied status as failure to understand the ability to work on implied status and/or as a PGWP applicant may turn into human rights cases. #cdnimm

551 2018-07-26 22:43:57 A couple of weeks ago I grilled chicken breasts marinated in the blueberry and ghost pepper sauce, cut with a little olive oil. Oh my goodness, that was insane!!
552 2018-07-26 22:43:08 Wow I LOVE that quilt top. Is it dark purple or grey? Super hype, especially if it's the former. Also you seem to have gone all out with your Les Paul. Mine's a Collector's Choice 15 with Whizz A4 paf clones and a RS harness with properly matched pots and paper in oil caps.

558 2018-07-26 22:42:20 @JerryBrownGov Dear Governor, Please wait until 2045 to propose a regional energy sharing program.  Doing it now would not facilitate clean energy development, in fact, it would provide maximum short term profits for coal, oil and gas.
559 2018-07-26 22:42:18 Oil companies rejoice!!!
560 2018-07-26 22:42:16 Honestly... get some.
Especially if you feel you have to have creamer in your coffee & you're body hates dairy.
It's not too sweet either & actually creamy (rather than just oily like coconut oil).
They also have the creamer in Strawberry, Cinnamon, & apparently Pumpkin Spice. 
561 2018-07-26 22:42:04 Buy a mayonnaise that has olive oil and put that on your hair for 30 minutes before you shower and watch your hair grow and feel at its best. Use a coconut milk shampoo and conditioner if you’d like as well; they make it grow really fast.
562 2018-07-26 22:41:55 Well obviously we buy it to feed all the  needed to power Bartertown #Brexit England after partition leaves the Scots, Welsh and Irish with our oil, nuclear, water and  Guinness

572 2018-07-26 22:40:50 Here's another program cut to pay for the Dougster's massive reduction in government funding caused by shotgun tax cuts. And for what? Lawsuits from cancelling cap & trade and gas price cuts that will disappear in a few weeks as oil companies bump prices to grab the gas tax cuts.
573 2018-07-26 22:40:40 If I buy my child a car at 16..... who paying for the extra shit? Not me... gas, oil change, tire might catch a flat, anything under the hood can go wrong.. yea, my fiancé can do that shit, I ain’t.
574 2018-07-26 22:40:26 They did it because SNP were pushing or independence and undervalued how much oil was there. So they hide it from Scotland because they knew there was a good chance Scotland would vote for independence.

578 2018-07-26 22:40:00 Actually, we’re not in a “jobless” recovery. Virtually every operation in the Oil Sands has been hiring in the last year (that’s my industry). We need to take personal responsibility for ourselves. Booms are NOT normal but we let it become our “normal”. Now that’s what we expect.
579 2018-07-26 22:39:56 re Cannabis Oil @LBC @iancollinsuk If it was freely available to purchase in Boots (etc) recreational use wouldn't change as medicinal cannabis has the THC (the "high") removed. Medicinal use would soar tho, as people with ailments who need it would finally be able to access it!
580 2018-07-26 22:39:55 Did that once because I was heading to oil rig & job got cancelled & I was wide awake at 3am so I stopped & stood in line.  Doors opened at 5am & I took off running  with everybody else in the store for no fkn reason.  Didn’t really need anything, I just got excited, lol.
581 2018-07-26 22:39:46 The oil is high in purene, which is really bad for those with gout and possibly other forms of arthritis.
582 2018-07-26 22:39:41 It’s #sharkweek!! I love sharks, let’s keep@them out of our cosmetics: squalene oil comes from Sharks liver  squalane oil is a plant derived version that does not  Go for the squalane!! Your skin naturally produces this on its own but decreases as we age. Great for oily skin!
583 2018-07-26 22:39:39 What has the Irish Republic done in this regard? I'm sure it receives some compensation for its offshore oil/gas Extraction. It received over 3 billion € in tax on refined products in 2016. I'm sure that would be the start of an excellent Climate Change Mitigation Fund.

590 2018-07-26 22:37:58 The sad thing about Israel is that its security is only ensured by American desire to have a nuclear outpost near the world's oil reserves and by mostly antisemitic American Christian's who think all Jews have to move there so jesus can come back and kill most of them.

592 2018-07-26 22:37:46 Can't exactly speak for myself due to a lack of beard growing abilities but plain ol' almond oil is excellent for both making your hair silky & treating itchy/flaky skin or scalp issues. Also: It smells like almonds! Cheap & cheerful, around €5 in most chemists.
593 2018-07-26 22:37:46 You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. They use cutting edge farming technology. They also do more than farming. Our local colony has a huge state of the art custom fabrication shop. They produce parts to sell to the oil field. They also buy our seed

They want the oil, they growing the bud for sale to export, the oils made from leaf and waste product anyway. All PR stunt and medicine be shite! Screw it up like all they do. should be LEGAL
598 2018-07-26 22:36:35 Well, Norway has a lot of oil and gas. And fortunately just Democratic Socialism. Very little diversity in political fractions so easy to maintain longterm politic goals. But, like rest of Europe - US pay for our Defence - freeloading.

659 2018-07-26 22:29:34 About being represented at the meeting, you should understand that the article focuses on the bilateral agreement signed by the 2 Presidents to build a cross-border pipeline and allow the transfer and sale of oil, not the refinery itself. The refinery will just benefit from it.

669 2018-07-26 22:26:40 Set their oil ablaze we don't need it fuck them let's remove their souls from this planet as for me and my famila and friends we are ready for what they want to bring here if they brown they down vaporizer these sandniggers before they do us
670 2018-07-26 22:26:22 5 I was reading about the Bakken oil boom and how it impacted reservations near by. And there’s been documentation on increased drug use and human trafficking. A lot of these workers prey on young indigenous women

672 2018-07-26 22:26:07 The oil is good though.

674 2018-07-26 22:25:49 these are all extra steps focused on specific concerns (breakouts, redness, oil) that generally go after your cleanser & before your moisturizer/facial oil. if you’re looking for a cleanser i love cerave’s foaming face wash!

680 2018-07-26 22:24:32 I have an idea that could give MD of forte oil and it would help youth in Nigeria and make him money for life...with 5million nairaa.
681 2018-07-26 22:24:31 No one should cook heirloom tomatoes that are properly ripe. Sliced, a little salt, maybe some oil or balsamic vinegar.
682 2018-07-26 22:24:27 I lost mine is it called rosehip oil??fr
683 2018-07-26 22:24:22 Hay algunas cosas que son chamuyo igual. Por ejemplo el mineral oil, los parabenos y el protector solar están medio demonizados y no pudieron comprobar que hagan mal todavía
684 2018-07-26 22:24:18 Business owners in #SouthOrange are still on alert after last weekends attempted theft of cooking oil at an establishment on South Orange Avenue.

688 2018-07-26 22:23:40 The oil when belly up .was foreign companies who were getting the oil.chaves took them over by the military and chavistas.ran everything to the ground. like happen in Africa ...
689 2018-07-26 22:23:31 I did see it and agree about the concern. It reminds me about the debate over the fuel additive MTBE a decade ago. MTBE backers proposed a "compromise" that would shield oil companies from liability in exchange for a digestible clean up fund.
690 2018-07-26 22:22:56 I just LOVE almost putting ammonia in my waffles bc the bottle is shaped the same as our oil. :)))))
691 2018-07-26 22:22:52 Bush lied! It’s all about (salad) oil!
692 2018-07-26 22:22:42 Money supply could be one cause. Lack of productivity another. Decrease oil revenue is also. Currency control is an important one (but you didn't mention it in your first response).

695 2018-07-26 22:22:15 Not for money. Not for oil!
696 2018-07-26 22:22:04 The EU buys far more than the US. Imports & exports both matter. Simple %s such as trade in oil/gold/EU HQs of US firms skew complexity of geography in trading patterns.
697 2018-07-26 22:21:55 A simple caprese salad - tomatoes, mozzarella, basil, olive oil, little bit of salt
698 2018-07-26 22:21:53 It's not jif. This is the creamy peanut butter that you have to mix the oil with. They all look like this.

700 2018-07-26 22:20:50 Oh no more oil spills?   When will BP invest in algae as a fuel??? If refined correctly, the entire world could receive cheap electricity. But they would have to contribute somehow.
701 2018-07-26 22:20:41 I will be 40 this year, and have been cancer-free for 5 years after being diagnosed with aggressive Melanoma at 33, had multiple surgeries including brain, radiation, etc... was in a consistent downwards spiral until I did 2 ‘loony’ things:
1/ Keto diet
2/ High-Dose Cannabis Oil
702 2018-07-26 22:19:55 Hard to believe. Don't think US public would support another war of choice in the Middle East. An attack would cause the price of oil to skyrocket and be very bad for republicans in the midterms. Attacking Iran could very well be worse for Trump than Iraq was for GW Bush.
703 2018-07-26 22:19:29 That pic of the single leaf looks different than the Castor oil...Yay.....you gonna have figs..(◕‿◕)
704 2018-07-26 22:19:29 Originally we just needed to replace the hose that brings oil to the turbo which is like 39.99 but naturally now it’s the whole turbo.
705 2018-07-26 22:19:22 I'm confused. Is the anti TMX argument about indigenous rights, pipeline risk, tanker safety, market forces, or world heavy oil refining capacity? It sure feels like the anti TMX crowd simply throw as much against the wall as they can hoping something will stick.

[慣用句](香港やその他中華英語圏)
1.頑張れ

同じ意味を持つ中国語の慣用句「加油(jia you)」からの借用語。直訳ですね。「油を加える」→「頑張れ」。

例 Add oil lor. I'll support you. 頑張れ。応援するよ。
733 2018-07-26 22:14:49 There's enough domestic corn to support it. How do the oil folk feel about it? They have traditionally opposed  year round ethanol blending. Someone profits. Someone loses. Maybe the loss of SEC-STATE T-REX TILLERSON, left the refiners in a bind.
734 2018-07-26 22:14:47 Someone  needs to create essential oil called"leave me alone ffs"..

738 2018-07-26 22:14:33 It’s always better to fry the chips in fresh oil than rancid stuff
739 2018-07-26 22:14:26 cuz they buy into propaganda paid for by oil companies
740 2018-07-26 22:14:26 Do you know what this is? It's a one-deem coin. It's the price for a pound of bread, or a bottle of oil.
741 2018-07-26 22:14:25 That's often what happens with big movements. It is like an oil tanker steering towards the shore. Even if one individual discovers the bad direction, it will take a lot to avoid the disaster.

756 2018-07-26 22:11:58 In many ways the world is being destroyed by people with average intellects and Reductionist views who actually refuse to consider the Emergent qualities that their combined activities present. Nowhere is this sharper than in the oil business or in Silicon Valley.

Not as much as argued. I did exaggerate Permian diff which is $10, but you can almost carry it to a refinery from there

783 2018-07-26 22:08:11 Why? Didn't he deactivate his Twitter account on his own free will? 

He could have simply stayed on Twitter, apologize for not disclosing that he's the managing director in a foundation which invests in oil and thus has additional vested interest into Tesla failing.


784 2018-07-26 22:08:04 The tankers have absolutely nothing to do with this. But keep reaching and getting all these tree hugging dummies to follow you. Just saw 2 “non-canadian” oil tankers tied off on the east coast. Not a single #greenpeace protestor around. Not enough money in it?

792 2018-07-26 22:07:08 The five wise virgins (Matthew 25:1-13) kept their lamps filled with oil because they anticipated any one of a number of possible futures as to the uncertain timing of the arrival of the bridegroom. They considered every possibility the foolish virgins never bothered to consider.

795 2018-07-26 22:06:58 I can so no reason it needs to be built. Canada does not use that oil. At 70 per barrel of crude it makes no economic sense to exploit the tar sands.

808 2018-07-26 22:05:39 So you're against subsidies to oil and coal, correct?

813 2018-07-26 22:05:10 Prove Presidental seat secured to being with.
Secret Service stuff.

Like inheriting a position with major gas station company overwhelmed with flawed programming.

Some sell stock in oil.

815 2018-07-26 22:04:55 Promises made to yourself, in the dark, in the tiny corner of your mind where you desperately chained the remaining shreds of your sanity.

Your promises are fake, like you, like your family. Just snake oil remedies designed to remove freedom and democracy from the illiterate.
816 2018-07-26 22:04:45 Y’all smoke the oil pens?
817 2018-07-26 22:04:35 I don’t know what it’s like everywhere, but in these parts, local farms aren’t really supplying the nearby cities anyway. The city of Calgary is fed by produce from California, Mexico, or Peru. And folks can only consume so much canola oil.
818 2018-07-26 22:04:27 Although in their case failing to pay Swiss oil services companies has led to their production rate cutting in half, China does not respect sanctions, if the price is right!
819 2018-07-26 22:04:25 「日本では児童ポルノが町中で売られているのか！」って別の棒で殴りかかってきそう
820 2018-07-26 22:04:23 Oil Prices are not, in fact, low. They're at 74 bucks a barrel. You can earn a very decent living selling oil at that price, as nearly every other oil producing nation demonstrates. Only one country has sanctions on Venezuela.
821 2018-07-26 22:04:19 so much little maintenance shit i need to get done on my car like oil change in shit but i just don’t be feeling like spending my money 
822 2018-07-26 22:04:18 castor oil!!
823 2018-07-26 22:04:08 Funny.  Whale oil lights too.
824 2018-07-26 22:03:50 Sure, so all the more reason to protest/boycott/go bonkers dont you think? Is no one lobbying the Canadian gov to boycott Saudi oil? If not, we need to ask why?
825 2018-07-26 22:03:32 My message is to oil and gas operator and service companies to put more inlight on new technology in drilling and producing of oil and gas offshore and onshore projects, my role now is providing quality consulting, #oilandgasconsulting
826 2018-07-26 22:03:31 @PaulasChoice As more and more men follow the hipster beard trend, are you planning on any products for men with beards? A facial moisturizer which is beard-friendly, for example, or a beard balm/cream/oil to deal with beard itch/dry skin?
827 2018-07-26 22:03:16 Yes, follow the money.  Those plucky oil baron billionaires are doing everything they can to expose the corrupt 5-figure salary university scientists, but we have to do OUR part and follow the money!
828 2018-07-26 22:03:12 Well Jim,  I’m in too,  tins of tomato and olive oil, tuna and flour.  Also Bog rolls just because I think I should.  God help those who cannot afford this. I’m feeling so sad for them. With the heatwave withering the crops and Brexit, it’s not looking good.
829 2018-07-26 22:03:09 Olive oil ice cream is delicious, though. @saltandstraw
830 2018-07-26 22:03:08 I came home from work and just smell coconut oil 
why does nana cook with so much oil she even uses oil while making omelette what the heck
831 2018-07-26 22:03:03 Give you an oil change right quick 
832 2018-07-26 22:02:50 API chief in Denver: U.S. trade policy is 'top priority' for oil and gas industry
833 2018-07-26 22:02:42 昨日疲れてて
リプ大会するの忘れてた

ごめん！
834 2018-07-26 22:02:36 We are slowly losing our culture in Ghana , I just saw a guy washing his hands after eating bofrot  instead of rubbing the oil on his head.
835 2018-07-26 22:02:28 And that Tariff problem you spoke of... Trump took a piece of Putin's oil/energy deal, and got concessions from EU like we predicted
836 2018-07-26 22:02:21 He carry hot groundnut oil , if you do anyhow he report you to Jack
837 2018-07-26 22:02:12 Get that peppermint oil bitch put it on ya temples
838 2018-07-26 22:02:00 My spiritual parent more Grace and fresh oil in Jesus precious name
839 2018-07-26 22:01:53 And you can bang on to your kids about “when the oil money arrived”
840 2018-07-26 22:01:53 would u guys be interested in custom essential oil blends?? would come with a crystal roller bottle of ur choice + a cuter bottle (+crystals of ur choice infused) made w young living/doterra oils ~ will be $20 shipped & last for quite a while + super high quality
841 2018-07-26 22:01:46 I use grapeseed oil religiously and canola works well
842 2018-07-26 22:01:45 This has been a pretty productive day off. Got an oil change, a haircut AND a mani/pedi.
843 2018-07-26 22:01:33 Shape, color, pore configuration, oil levels, sun damage, hair color, the presence or absence of boogers. Any other parameters you can think of?
844 2018-07-26 22:01:29 If the Liberals had not been elected TransMountain and  Northern Gateway would be up and running right now and Canadian producers would be getting the benefits of it. Meanwhile the US is booming in the oil sector.
845 2018-07-26 22:01:27 Get oil not just gas.
846 2018-07-26 22:01:18 y muchos otros no están en funcionamiento y se robaron sus inversiones. Con probidad te digo que el gerente qué más robo allí fuer el general Wilfredo Figueroa Chacin, de seguridad integral. Cantidades de proyectos fantasmas solo para quedarse con la inversión
847 2018-07-26 22:01:09 Prince Harry needs to invest in Castor oil
848 2018-07-26 22:01:09 And 10 flasks of oil, right @RyanVerniere?
849 2018-07-26 22:01:08 Russia said it was a mistake not to intervene in Libya. Libya is a open air slave market. It's oil exports are zero. Who is selling oil to Italy now? The US.
850 2018-07-26 22:00:59 Palm oil production seems to be the only priority in this area. There are laws to protect these animals but they are being ignored. STOP using palm oil.
851 2018-07-26 22:00:51 we haven't even talked yet about maintenance costs. The only service I've done on my Leaf so far is a change in cabin filters. Brakes last forever in EVs due to regenerative braking. No belts, no spark plugs, no transmission, no oil changes. EVs are very simple compared to ICE
852 2018-07-26 22:00:51 Is climate change a hoax?  Is it perpetuated by 1000s of scientists all over the world for decades?  Or, is this administration controlled by the Koch Brothers, Heritage Foundation.big oil & gas..who have filled major cabinet positions including Pompeo, DeVos, Pence, Pruitt
853 2018-07-26 22:00:42 Venezuela is also impacted very significantly by sanctions and lower oil prices
854 2018-07-26 22:00:40 Ok so
Get some bread into a blender, maybe slap in some oil and copious amounts of pepper and preferred spices then toast in the oven, beat an egg or two to do the initial coating and then coat chicken bits in that before throwing in to the toasted breadcrumb to coat

859 2018-07-26 22:00:20 Great list, double down on @Halsrethink  as a must -trade,politics,world issues and @ttmygh and @LukeGromen Would add @GlobalProTrader and @EconomicAlpha under #gold and @spomboy for anything. @ErikSTownsend and @chigrl for oil and @GrantsPub and @CGrantWSJ for #markets

861 2018-07-26 22:00:05 Which product has more #calories per serving?
A. Oil
B. Butter
C. Margarine

Ans: They are all the same! Per serving each has approximately 100 calories per tablespoon. The difference is in the type of #fat.
862 2018-07-26 22:00:00 Does anyone in nyc have cbd oil
863 2018-07-26 21:59:40 Lol I’m not the one shooting up on a train. I agree that is pretty rock bottom though.
864 2018-07-26 21:59:30 Se quiere refinanciar el régimen. Desde hace tiempo los chinos han hecho desfalcos a la Cantv con la anuencia de su directiva roja rojita. La compra de activos a los chinos ha sido utilizada como excusa para robar. Proyectos como IPTV, la red metro ethernet, sistemas de seguridad
865 2018-07-26 21:59:08 I'd try mayo ice cream. I mean Mayo is eggs and oil basically.
866 2018-07-26 21:59:08 Oil based makeup remover worked for me!!
867 2018-07-26 21:58:53 Pretty sure it was billions. With a B

869 2018-07-26 21:58:38 I'm very libertarian, I say legalize and tax drugs, just so you know where I stand, but it seems to me if you're shooting up on a train you've already hit rock bottom. Again, no disrespect.
870 2018-07-26 21:58:32 I’m sorry you lost your job. Good luck in finding a new one and please don’t ever believe an orange guy selling snake oil. We will get through this but we need to rally the middle class to get out and vote for Democrats to restore a checks and balances system that we need.
871 2018-07-26 21:58:28 Fabulous news but I hope it will be nothing but pure oil & not a synthetic version? #Fibromyalgia #chronicpain #chronicillness #epilepsy #mentalhealth #Cancer #invisibleillness
872 2018-07-26 21:58:04 . No oil products for you then
873 2018-07-26 21:57:56 oooh so like put oil only after it's hot? omg I've been doing it wrong lol
874 2018-07-26 21:57:50 I like how they allude that the only reason Venezuela failed was because of dropping oil prices.
875 2018-07-26 21:57:47 Selling snake oil
876 2018-07-26 21:57:39 Oil Can Boyd
877 2018-07-26 21:57:07 My understanding is that it was suppressed under 30 year rule. Released without fanfare as very few knew of its existence and then it was come across by an academic oil industry researcher who understood its significance... That's just my recollection tho & could be totally wrong
878 2018-07-26 21:56:58 I  am  A SC resident..we are going blue..no oil drilling..find the parents..children  are  crying! No to Kavanagh . .we will help you. We want WHAT cleared out of the mafia idiots
879 2018-07-26 21:56:40 It is,  using traditional hot wax and oil pastel resist :)
880 2018-07-26 21:56:23 ‘We need to phase out the oil sands’, @justintrudeau

#cdnpoli
881 2018-07-26 21:56:14 Steel is dead, coal is dead, oil is dead,  WOW!! I learned something new to day!   Then what?  We all just die!!??
882 2018-07-26 21:56:08 The Democratic Party does not want to be like Venezuela.  More like Scandinavia which has a high standard of living and good equality.  Venezuela was too based off of one resource, oil.  A diversified economy is important
883 2018-07-26 21:55:55 “Which of these makes yoghurt?”

“Olive oil”

nice one @JoeProllll you actual cock
884 2018-07-26 21:55:42 Old lmaoooo you’re like 10  love u bby. I know this is off topic but u get 11 nutts and buttholes for each oil rig in Canny
885 2018-07-26 21:55:42 Will CBD be included? It's costing my family a fair bit to supply my Dad, who needs medicinally.  He was taking 3 different pharma pills per day, which had very negative side effects. He now just takes CBD oil and feels a lot better, but its expensive.
886 2018-07-26 21:55:32 Ladies stop being insecure about talking to man cause you picked up a lil weight. Let a nigga rub them curves down in coconut oil have you looking like the biscuits your grandmother use to make... all glossy and what not lmao  
887 2018-07-26 21:55:18 Pure fake news/staged reality TV.  This is cruel to get people’s hopes up about a big steel comeback.  He acts like our country is a game show with big prizes/giveaways. What a snake oil salesmen.
888 2018-07-26 21:55:07 Hayi hayi never kalok. Not wena. Arrogance and you are like oil and water
889 2018-07-26 21:55:07 Aaaah.  BUT whilst Scotland only makes up 8.3% of The Union, it would have 96.5% of the oil.

< wait for it > 

Have you thought of THAT ?
890 2018-07-26 21:55:06 The oil man
891 2018-07-26 21:54:56 حلوه عيونك وهي شايفه اسناني ماخذه سلفي كذا.
892 2018-07-26 21:54:55 Coz Turncoat's integrity will come under the microscope?  As the IPA's snake oil salesman, has a lot to fear.
893 2018-07-26 21:54:49 yea financial warfare is phase 1, they've already started the MEK "terrorism" as of last year... as long as iran can keep exporting oil to india, the attacks will escalate
894 2018-07-26 21:54:43 If olive oil ice cream exists then mayonnaise ice isn’t a stretch. It’s just more fat added to fat.
895 2018-07-26 21:54:38 It's called Compassion and Empathy.
896 2018-07-26 21:54:29 Of course nicer to have a fully #ElectricVehicle that doesn’t need much servicing Oil  
Clutch  Ignition  Engine  Clutch  Break pads - Hardly used, Radiator  .....
897 2018-07-26 21:54:22 Olive oil
898 2018-07-26 21:54:11 Yesterday was a great day off. Bought some households, payed bills, got my puppy her shots, got an oil change, a haircut and ended the day playing baseball with my family. 
899 2018-07-26 21:53:59 Emmmmmmaaa the Oil Change!! How do you get to the festival’s
900 2018-07-26 21:53:51 Adulting: getting way too excited about finding a Jiffy Lube Groupon while waiting to get your oil changed

904 2018-07-26 21:53:19 There’s a product called Zform made of hemp cellulose that could replace plastic and it is biodegradable. But big oil doesn’t make it so...
905 2018-07-26 21:53:15 Really annoyed that I have to get an oil change
906 2018-07-26 21:53:13 He was obviously supporting Russia when he called out Germany, for buying oil from Russia...
907 2018-07-26 21:53:06 Golfing over oil,
Sparring over toys.
908 2018-07-26 21:53:00 My cars oil needs changed, ou side needs washed, and inside needs detailed. BUT WHEN DO I FIND THE TIME.
909 2018-07-26 21:52:56 What do you call giving handouts to mega oil companies?
I don't want to live in a nation that wealthy people feel they don't have to give back after reaping all the benefits of those who came before paying higher taxes and making this nation better.

912 2018-07-26 21:52:19 Jess just drank some castor oil!!!! LET THE GAMES BEGIN!! 
913 2018-07-26 21:52:16 @IngrahamAngle it’s a fungus. Cant remember what it’s called, but get some fungicide or some neem oil. Don’t let the leaves fall on the ground and don’t water from the top.
914 2018-07-26 21:52:11 i have coconut oil in my hair and i think it’s irritating my scalp
915 2018-07-26 21:52:03 Dear @JustVitamins, when is your flaxseed oil coming back in stock?
916 2018-07-26 21:51:53 I went and got an a quick oil change today and they told me they had a free top off service.  That’s good.  But I thought the guy said free taco service.  Disappointed.
917 2018-07-26 21:51:46 I still got a few pieces in my queue that I'll be working on but !! Theres still SLOTS OPEN in both oil flats and simple paintings ! So if you wanna snatch some and help me out please dm / note or email me  or if you just want a regular comm that would be a big help too !

919 2018-07-26 21:51:23 Obscene amounts of taxpayer $$ was handed to Dem-connected "alternative energy" mandated frauds and scams that WASTED more energy than the disfavored version (as with the massively corrupt Ethanol gambit). Corrupt pols and their cronies using fake science as snake oil must GO!

921 2018-07-26 21:51:16 So sorry we have to share a continent with oil spilling, coal burning America. You could take a good lesson from our green energy in Canada.  Shame on you!
922 2018-07-26 21:51:09 I have a certain urge to call her Canola Oil so bad...idk why 
923 2018-07-26 21:50:45 Interesting he chose 1979, a moment when the dollar was at its weakest, causing the oil crisis. Iranian rial also impacted substantially by sanctions (who wants to hold a currency you can't trade for anything in?).
924 2018-07-26 21:50:40 Shaving my legs with baby oil was the best decision I’ve made all week. Messy, but worth it for super smooth legs. 

Oh, and the Skinny Tan I used will make me look faaaaabulous when I go day-drinking tomorrow. I’m feeling good, ngl 
925 2018-07-26 21:50:29 Yasmeen  @Yasss_mohd
926 2018-07-26 21:50:25 I use to haaaate the fenty foundation because it was so matte and I already have dry skin so all my foundations are more creamy. But then I went on vacation to somewhere very hot/humid and it was a life saver to not like an oil slick
927 2018-07-26 21:50:24 I use the Moroccan argan oil shampoo and conditioner and that shit smells HEAVENLY.
928 2018-07-26 21:50:21 Tell you what, I never get bored of Armageddon.

The President upon finding out about the asteroid: 'My God, what do we do?' 

Cue music and cuts to Bruce Willis hitting golf balls on an oil rig.

Good dammit, I love this film. Don't even deny the ending is a tear jerker, man!
929 2018-07-26 21:50:12 Oil price needed to balance budget.

933 2018-07-26 21:49:36 I hate getting my oil changed Bc when they come back to show me that my oil is fresh or whatever I don’t know what to say. Like Good job, thanks! Lmao. It fr stresses me out
934 2018-07-26 21:49:27 Yeah me neither. I want a case of grease and free. Really like they’re penetrating oil
935 2018-07-26 21:49:26 Also, will have no spinoff from oil. My house price will likely go up and hence my taxes, but I know that this money flowing into the province does us good as a whole. And at this point any positive news is good news.
936 2018-07-26 21:49:20 I’m like 9000 miles deep without an oil change I expect my car to blow up soon
937 2018-07-26 21:49:15 If we had any oil worth drilling for don’t you think the oil companies would be going crazy to drill. Stop worrying about
938 2018-07-26 21:49:15 Good to hear that. But we have friends who cannot get maint contracts from anyone close enough. When our oil boiler person can arrive in 30 minutes why change to someone many hours away .. and I know people unable to get maint at all.

942 2018-07-26 21:48:55 Very interesting read mate. Curious to see how their fleet plans correlate to their capacity & growth plans up to 2024. 
Especially seeing the effect the rise in oil prices has had in making those decisions this past year.
943 2018-07-26 21:48:49 LOL Too true. Trudeau raises taxes,  increases regulations, demonizes the oil industry and moves Canada toward recession. Grows the gov. Trump cuts taxes and deregulates and the economy skyrockets, will likey hit 5% growth sometime.
944 2018-07-26 21:48:45 Are you going to tell Twitter how eggs and oil/butter are in cookie dough ice cream? They will enjoy that.
945 2018-07-26 21:48:42 Using castor oil on your lashes will also make them and make them more full! I got a bottle off of amazon that has little wands in it just for it. It definitely makes a difference
946 2018-07-26 21:48:31 Chickens are like custard or oil?
947 2018-07-26 21:48:17 Me tiene arta el meme de "mi mama dice"
948 2018-07-26 21:48:06 Laura, spray with Neem Oil.  Use 1 tsp of Neem Oil to 1 quart of water in a spray bottle.  Do no spray it on sunny day.  Do it in the evening when sun is going down.  You can purchase the oil at Home Depot.  I use it on my roses too.
949 2018-07-26 21:48:05 My coconut oil is totally solid
But these people are still telling me a jacket is not necessary.
950 2018-07-26 21:47:54 Epsom salts on the ground around plant and spray in the afternoon, above and below with “ neam oil”
951 2018-07-26 21:47:50 hello @KrazyEssentials, i’m going to need perfume oil and candle versions of black sunshine because this is truly your best scent yet! it’s so refreshing with a subtle sweetness. 
952 2018-07-26 21:47:36 Earned through the input from loyal supporters and season ticket sales. I'm not saying Celtics funds aren't what help our success in Scotland, what I am saying is it's generated from a passionate global support, not from the impulsive notion of a bored oil tycoon
953 2018-07-26 21:47:35 Many including my family served and died in Korea and Vietnam. They fought for freedom liberty not oil.
954 2018-07-26 21:47:34 Put olive oil
955 2018-07-26 21:47:17 A unos dias de volver a la misma rutina aburrida
956 2018-07-26 21:47:14 I’m hoping the chicken I just cooked isn’t bad and that it just tastes funky because of the coconut oil...
957 2018-07-26 21:47:13 @PnPCBC Why is NFLD crude mentioned in the same sentence as wind,solar which produce electricity? Crude oil is not used for that. NFLD has unlimited Hydro power why would they want wind,solar? How much NFLD crude is refined in Canada and exported?
958 2018-07-26 21:47:06 Coconut oil - in fridge. Keeps it hard like lard - let it melt between your knackers 2 x a day
959 2018-07-26 21:47:06 No you're confusing it with the Bushy Beaver. That's on the other side of town
960 2018-07-26 21:46:49 Also castor oil helps :)
961 2018-07-26 21:46:35 Thank goodness. I had a cat w thyroid problems and he was skin and bones in no time.  I was buying every kind of food on the shelves and he really liked sardines in oil.
962 2018-07-26 21:46:18 Venezuela was harpooned by Russia and OPEC. They have the second largest oil reserves. Go to Venezuela if you want to see what will happen to US if the troglodytes maintain power for too much longer. You will be a casualty
963 2018-07-26 21:46:12 Idk the weed lady brought it I think coconut oil
964 2018-07-26 21:46:04 I went into get  a oil change then they said my motor mounts were goin out then they said it was my transmission so that alone took a week now im just getting it back
965 2018-07-26 21:45:47 i over-salted the scallion sauce, and then read reviews of the thing, which made me modify the recipe. will see how it goes. i think hot oil poured over scallions, ginger and salt is generally an ok combination.
966 2018-07-26 21:45:46 Blend 9 tsps gumbo with 2 1/2 pints cheese. Mix in Olive Oil. Mix until crumbly. Serve on salad
967 2018-07-26 21:45:35 Neem oil.
968 2018-07-26 21:45:33 good morning,,, i dont have an oil pastel for later hcjkjzbsjz im-
969 2018-07-26 21:45:17 Yum!! Cheese and olive oil, the two best things in life
970 2018-07-26 21:44:54 Oh yes, plus one of your 5 a day, plus rapeseed oil high in the Omegas, so altogether doing your body a favour 
971 2018-07-26 21:44:50 Hi Marcos.  Send us an email to Info@villacappelli.com and I can give you a source in Canada. Our oil, just under and slightly different label.
972 2018-07-26 21:44:50 ...to Vlad. In return for you selling out the presidency for Russian oil.
973 2018-07-26 21:44:39 we are not the oil we are the vessel
974 2018-07-26 21:44:36 And bravo @tompierrefs for emphasizing need to shift buildings to renewable energy. Oil & gas corps are already attempting to block this essential #BCClimateAction step.
975 2018-07-26 21:44:34 Does it though? Where is the guarantee we will make that much? Fact is the tar sands have already shown that they have been majority stripped. We already get a majority of our oil from the Middle East, and so BC and Alberta really only need to find a good situation for themselves
976 2018-07-26 21:44:20 me: can hardly get myself to spend $50 dollars on a oil change I need desperately for my car 

also me: drops $100 on a festival outfit without hesitation 

.... I’m not okay
977 2018-07-26 21:44:16 Try spraying the leaves with Neem Oil.
978 2018-07-26 21:44:16 Delighted for little Sophia Gibson and her family that she will be first child in NI to get possession licence to allow her to receive cannabis oil at home to manage her severe epilepsy. This kid was fighting for her life in an ICU just over a fortnight ago. @Help4sophiag5
979 2018-07-26 21:44:14 The logic simply does not follow. OPEC is not controlled by the U.S.. It is, however, controlled by a number of anti-American governments. Also, U.S. oil competes against OPEC, so again, does not follow.
980 2018-07-26 21:44:11 I have a migraine and I put peppermint oil on my temples and it was so strong I was like crying for thirty minutes because my eyes got so cold. My coworker was like “you’re supposed to dilute it!” But I am going for RESULTS here people!
981 2018-07-26 21:44:00 I don't know about pills, but ingesting a couple drops of oil is genuinely helpful  I feel like pills are just like another step away from the result

983 2018-07-26 21:43:57 A LOT of MURDERERS are in the Middle East , including the US Military  Everybody fighting for "a piece of the pie"  Natural resources ( Genie Oil ), Ports & Pipelines and anything else that's not nailed down Bubble Heads & Banksters -  ONE RING TO RULE US ALL #UNREDACTED
984 2018-07-26 21:43:55 obviously dont ingest the oil, but try smelling it sometimes, or sticking a couple of drops on your collar :D worth a try at least!
985 2018-07-26 21:43:44 Mais c’est pareil genre j’ai fais plein de recherche «  skincare routine » j’ai pris du savon noir, de l’aloe verra , du tea tree oil etc je me démaquille tout le temps bref j’en prend grave soin et que dalle
986 2018-07-26 21:43:43 That's big: privately held Encino to buy Utica Shale oil and gas assets from Chesapeake Energy for about $2 billion; news comes a month after privately held Ascent Resources said it would buy Utica Shale assets from four companies for about $1.5 billion.
987 2018-07-26 21:43:36 @HempLifeToday 
Got my oil!
Thank goodness!

989 2018-07-26 21:43:29 Snake oil salesmen...and 80% of @GOP voters have swallowed the whole bottle.  Truly challenged intellectually.
990 2018-07-26 21:43:25 Idk how many brain cells i lost by watching @FoxNews while getting my oil changed
991 2018-07-26 21:43:20 So I guess the new oil cap for Fords is a plastic thing that snaps closed or open, it’s not a threaded one. He said it must’ve not be snapped closed and got opened by the vibrations of my truck or some shit. They came and fixed it and gave me a free oil change for next time tho
992 2018-07-26 21:43:00 Need to cool down?
Put a drop of Peppermint Essential Oil on the inside of your wrists.
993 2018-07-26 21:42:48 What about all the oil....our oil 
994 2018-07-26 21:42:45 @realDonaldTrump let our coal company build oil extraction from coal plant. 41% more oil reserve for THE USA and Kentucky alone has 600 yr. supply of coal for extraction into oil , this will make our country bigger than SADI ARIBIA in oil now that is being the big boy on WORLD .

996 2018-07-26 21:42:18 My idea of being dressed up.
1) jeans and socks are hole free 
2) t-shirts aren't ripped 
3) shoes don't have grass stains 
4) my hats aren't stained with grease or oil..
997 2018-07-26 21:42:18 I have just killed approx 9 flying insects in my room, with a shoe, and covered myself in tea tree oil. I smell like a first aid kit and my ceiling is ruined, but I may survive the night...
998 2018-07-26 21:42:17 I don't know about that. I heard on the news recently where Saudi Arabia has so much oil that it will never be able to get rid of it all. I am hearing that the world market is glutted with oil, or at least it was recently.
999 2018-07-26 21:42:14 I think the thousands of dead Iraqis & Syrians killed in a thinly veiled oil war would disagree if they could talk.
1000 2018-07-26 21:42:13 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
1001 2018-07-26 21:42:13 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1002 2018-07-26 21:42:11 Our dining service Nourish Inc hosted a farmers' market today and I bought parmigiano reggiano, fresh ricotta, and expensive olive oil, which means I just had the best lunch ever.
1003 2018-07-26 21:42:09 Cameron always says the house smells like a head shop because of the oil diffusers 
1004 2018-07-26 21:42:05 I can understand the desperation that drives people to drink the snake oil. Clinging to false hope is ultimately counterproductive, every time.
1005 2018-07-26 21:41:27 Never ever ever question the redoubtable Iowan. They know a snake oil salesman and will run them out on a rail if need be.
1006 2018-07-26 21:41:27 If you have been in the shop before and you're satisfied with the results, don't forget to refer us to your family, friends or whoever you think it might need help with their vehicle. Also, use the hashtag #TomsTrans and get a free A/C inspection or the oil change special!
1007 2018-07-26 21:41:00 Great movie, hot oil in the face ugh...
1008 2018-07-26 21:40:59 here's hoping i can fookin' sleep tonight wish me luck ya'll cbd oil is wack
1009 2018-07-26 21:40:59 Cleaned my Doc Martens with lemon essential oil to get the smell of forest swamp out of them while listening to Nirvana’s Unplugged album

1018 2018-07-26 21:39:59 confirmed: leading therapists confirm that once the Donald complains, Mitch Mcconnell wants to become politician
1019 2018-07-26 21:39:57 One wonders whether the ultimate consumer society will ever be capable of a trade balance. e.g. the US owns 3% of global oil reserves, consumes approx 25% of global production despite only having 5% of global population.  Perhaps the trade answer is in part looking at consumption
1020 2018-07-26 21:39:55 Of course they did, they get money from the oil companies too. No c'mon you know that. Big surprise/disappointment...NOOOOOOT!
1021 2018-07-26 21:39:52 I washed & conditioned with Kenra shampoo & conditioner. Deep conditioned with the shea moisture coconut oil mask. Kenra blow dry spray. & the design essentials silk essentials.

1024 2018-07-26 21:39:32 Yes. Thank you Jimboman :)
1025 2018-07-26 21:39:29 Well, I will spare you the description of the production process of the aforementioned oil because it’s simply gross, but I know it’s widely used in perfumery and is considered an aphrodisiac.

1037 2018-07-26 21:37:42 She’s an expert on Russia/Soviet Union since way-back in the Bush Sr. era. That clip is great, & obvs applies to Donald, too. But she’s got ties to Exxon/oil $, and many of her more recent comments make her seem more like she’s on Team Trump than on Team America.
1038 2018-07-26 21:37:23 When America takes 1 million lives in
Iraq for oil - Not terrorism
When Serbs rape muslim women in
Kosovo/Bosnia - Not terrorism
When Russians kill 200,000 chechens
in bombing - not terrorism
When Jews kick out Palestinians and
take their land - Not terrorism?
1039 2018-07-26 21:37:20 No it isn’t if you’ve got tea tree oil or any skin care products with it in put that on tonight and it does wonders trust
1040 2018-07-26 21:37:15 nooo i have dry as hell, thick curly unruly hair so i can go 3-4 days without it starting to get even a little greasy, and can stretch it to 7 with the help of dry shampoo! but i know that’s not realistic at all for more straight or oil prone hair
1041 2018-07-26 21:37:06 Wait... someone forgot the cutting oil
1042 2018-07-26 21:37:05 @realDonaldTrump ask USS why in the 1980’s when the Union made contract concessions with the understanding doing so would save jobs by Modernizing Plants & keep them competitive in the future; why they didn’t reinvest in their plants instead used that capital to buy Marathon Oil
1043 2018-07-26 21:37:02 get a lot of things fried in oil
1044 2018-07-26 21:37:00 Congrats to my NFLD friends and customers on the new $6.8 billion offshore oil development.
1045 2018-07-26 21:36:51 Also a mystery: why did big oil not diversify into other energy industries?
1046 2018-07-26 21:36:43 Gee whiz, it's precious reading maga insults toward Tom Arnold when they think a vile, vulgar, immoral, low IQ snake oil con man is a prophet of God. Self reflection, facts and irony do not phase this cult. But the trend makes blocking bots and cultists an easy afternoon task!
1047 2018-07-26 21:36:22 How is it with the gas and oil price. Saudi was going to produce more? How are the farmers? 12 billion at tax payer’s cost. How is it with your foes? Not anymore?
1048 2018-07-26 21:36:20 "What kind of oil?"

He pats his friend on the shoulder.

"I hope you get to feeling better. A sad Nando is no bueno."
1049 2018-07-26 21:36:14 Nope. What an asinine comment.Your answer illuminates the idiocy of your politics. I call your bluff if you actually believe there’s no drugs and that “liberal policy” caused drug problems. People cause drug problems, and I’m assuming you’re a human.
1050 2018-07-26 21:35:56 This terrorist attack took place while the UN Envoy for Yemen is in #Sanaa carrying out his mediation efforts on #Hodeida, not surprisingly, this attack came about right after #Iran’s threats on international shipping lanes and oil exports from neighboring countries.
1051 2018-07-26 21:35:55 This woman brought her own oil filter and oil to the oil change place and she’s really a legend tbh
1052 2018-07-26 21:35:50 Background: the company I work for is one of several that are contracted at the oil terminal I work at.  Today we were doing some well padding installation (the concrete squares around an embedded monitoring well) and one of the guys from the other crews was there.
1053 2018-07-26 21:35:47 Venezuela could cope with its previous oil price crunch (1983) for a reason: it had a vibrant private sector. 

After hundreds of expropriations and confiscations between 2007 and 2012, Chаvismo exacerbated dependence on oil money. The results are there for all to see.
1054 2018-07-26 21:35:32 Haven't you noticed though WM are trying to cull the use of renewable energy in favour of expensive Bricks like #HinckleyPoint and that driiing thing canny mind name lol that SNP has successfully fought to halt for now. Oil is a bonus and has to be seen that way..
1055 2018-07-26 21:35:26 Well, at least for now anyways. Trump is big on oil and coal, and as long as he is President I think oil will remain high. Once the Democrat's get back in power and climate change becomes a top priority, oil will plummet overnight.
1056 2018-07-26 21:35:18 Maybe for the same reason we buy other countries oil. We have more than ample supply.
1057 2018-07-26 21:35:06 RT @LivingSafely: Pop-Secret #Homestyle this July? Its top two ingredients are #popcorn and partially hydrogenated soybean oil.
1058 2018-07-26 21:34:56 Incorrect, they use the more expensive oil and yes distance matters because it raises the transportation costs. California very much wants our crude and has said so by buying all they can get.
1059 2018-07-26 21:34:53 #Yemen condemns the #Houthis’ attack on the two oil tankers belonging to the National Shipping Company of Saudi Arabia, each carrying 2 million barrels of crude oil, after crossing the Bab al-Mandeb Strait in the Red Sea on Wednesday morning.
1060 2018-07-26 21:34:52 I got 2 Oil pens. One for me and my pops. 

I got Gorilla glue and he got Skywalker OG. 

I'm loving this thing. Never had one before.
1061 2018-07-26 21:34:51 Really mad I been waiting two hours for oil change and my phone on 2 % 
1062 2018-07-26 21:34:44 Is there any mundane experience as uniquely feminine as the men at the oil change place trying to intimidate you into spending $50 on an air filter?
1063 2018-07-26 21:34:38 After the barrage of bullshit coming out of the CPC, Ford, Kenney and the other minions of the oil industry colour me unimpressed.
1064 2018-07-26 21:34:35 gotta go get my oil changed but first impressions.  Game feels fucking awesome! getting me so damn pumped, 1 v 1 v 1 is a lot of fun to
1065 2018-07-26 21:34:32 i’m screeching the last time i saw your dad he was harassing you about the oil in your car

1068 2018-07-26 21:34:20 Managed to scold my hand, foot, leg and stomach with hot oil  , on the hottest day of the year! took 3 hours for the agony to subside  #ImGonnaHaveScars
1069 2018-07-26 21:34:19 Once Mr White or Mr Blue shows you the direction get in , wait it out   till it turns..and it always turns or make your moolah intraday..either  way you have to sit tight..but it's your call on how you trade..:)
1070 2018-07-26 21:34:07 LoooL @ deep fried butter. I suddenly had to think about once seeing how they deep fry turkey in a huge barrel of oil. All that said, the people in the south do seem to understand how to barbecue though.
1071 2018-07-26 21:33:54 Probably out of work and trying to get a job on the oil rigs
1072 2018-07-26 21:33:42 have you seen a doctor because of it? Try putting some olive oil on a cotton ball and put it in your ear
1073 2018-07-26 21:33:39 With Isabella I don’t need love potions at all, she only uses civet oil but only on herself. I think I will summon my physician because it’s getting worse.
1074 2018-07-26 21:33:32 I want to watch the world burn. In a oil spill fire, ideally.

1076 2018-07-26 21:33:10 I’m sitting in a waiting room while getting an oil change.  There’s some tv show with Kevin Hart playing, while the rest of the waiting room is intently watching it.

What lawless land have I entered?
1077 2018-07-26 21:32:44 No because Big business is involved  and fossil fuels is their main profit !! Sustainable energy doesn't mix with oil companies, and coal !!

1079 2018-07-26 21:32:01 Liberal policy has allowed this to grow. 1 Reason we dont have it is because its 95% R here. This type of crap will NEVER gain even a toehold of acceptance here. We are not "privilaged" in any way. We just feed and fuel the privilaged that fly over.
1080 2018-07-26 21:31:53 Our demand for oil is insatiable, barring a market crash, I can't see it dropping that low.

1092 2018-07-26 21:30:11 @ThaboT_style lol you need some oil to sleep
1093 2018-07-26 21:30:02 Gus Tip: don’t smell fish oil tablets. It’s horrible.
1094 2018-07-26 21:29:50 I’m DOWN !! I have to get my oil change at 4 so hit me up when you’re home
1095 2018-07-26 21:29:48 If this happens, guesses on whether or not Trump gives a heads up to his buddies re: crude oil futures?
1096 2018-07-26 21:29:39 I have a little travel clock that registers the temperature . This temperature is too hot to sleep and seems to be rising. Why do I keep checking it? Must be cos I’ve closed the widows to prevent another  spidergate .Tea tree oil applied.
1097 2018-07-26 21:29:27 My skin NEVER stops it’s always a bottle of olive oil or drier than the dessert there is NO in between
1098 2018-07-26 21:29:15 Thanks to the Russians, the Christian Community in Syria survived YOUR PROXY-CIRCUS of horror. The US-REGIME!!!!! is the worlds enemy!

1100 2018-07-26 21:29:07 God bless and protect our defenders and please protect those beautiful waters along with the oil shipments which are needed so very badly by so many. God please protect the Saudi defenders and legitimate Yemen gov , Amen

I remain timelessly gorgeous of course.
1105 2018-07-26 21:28:03 i see an amazing herbalist, who, as part of a larger mix, gives me rosemary. and boy has it made a difference! plus, if you have some rosemary oil to hand, and you feel your mood dip, a quick smell of it can give you a boost. also helps wake you up :D
1106 2018-07-26 21:27:52 Even if he had been an incredibly able and astute leader, that would have happened because his tenure has seen a recession due to oil price crash and such contexts always means incumbents are unpopular. Quite apart from all the other reasons...
1107 2018-07-26 21:27:49 Seaweed Oil Balancing Toner makes my skin feel so refreshed. I would bring @karenb197735 along #TBSxSiTC

1110 2018-07-26 21:27:28 No, you pissed on Ford Field, but you also said Lucas Oil acoustics were shit. I’ve never heard anyone say that.
1111 2018-07-26 21:27:10 Drink olive oil....
1112 2018-07-26 21:26:58 i can understand that. some of my meds have done that to me. iron tablets are one that i really struggle with.
can i suggest trying rosemary tincture or oil? it's a great mood enhancer. i know some people are funny about herbal stuff, but it works great! tbc
1113 2018-07-26 21:26:41 OPENING DAY at Costco in my town:

Clerk: Not sure, I'm new here. 

Me: 
1114 2018-07-26 21:26:37 nothing says communist dictatorship quite like nationalizing oil & gas infrastructure. because it worked so well for venezuela
1115 2018-07-26 21:26:35 No, it’s cheap labor that exploited for high profit. And yes, there are capitalist gains in invading other countries, such as Iraq for oil. And if the kind of shit Amazon is pulling isn’t being pressed against them, then company accountability still has some strides to make.
1116 2018-07-26 21:26:33 Well..we keep on getting them and you keep on missing out..we had 2 back to back  close to $10 falls..1 from 72.90 to 63.44 and the next one from 75.27 to 66.29...there is no such thing as a perfect top or bottom that one should wait for:)
1117 2018-07-26 21:26:31 Yes what about them ? Oh yes, countriea with freedom of speech. Good example with Norway, oil rich, like Venezuela, but without the slimy socialism. Lefties don’t learn #vivasosialismo #vivalenin #vivamao
1118 2018-07-26 21:26:21 So gasoline,inflation & mortgage rates rise!"Drill baby drill" was meant for the oil companies shipping our energy abroad!There should be an export tax on our energy!
1119 2018-07-26 21:26:12 No oil and water issues here ;-) Happy to talk gudgeon pins, bearings and other such things (though it’ll only be a short conversation)

1122 2018-07-26 21:25:45 Wow! Lovely.
May I ask what research / reference images did you use for this? What 'sort' of refinery might it be? Smelting? (I'll need something cartoon oil refinery for my game at some point  )
1123 2018-07-26 21:25:45 Hasn’t OPEC manipulated oil pricing since the 70’s?  Is it reasonable to expect them to do nothing now?
1124 2018-07-26 21:25:37 Hiya!
This makes complete sense & is quite a brilliant idea. 
Mayonnaise is simply eggs, oil & some acid (like vinegar) after all..
It will only boost your baking!

Ideas like this date back to WW2/Depression days - they had limited ingredients & improvised!
1125 2018-07-26 21:25:22 That is the "block grant" which we get back and told we should be bloody grateful for it too!
Over 58Bn heads south from various taxes and VAT. Could be so much more if the oil hadn't been mismanaged for nearly half a century.
1126 2018-07-26 21:25:08 @LeeCamp First, taxpayers were not needed for the Fed to supply unlimited liquidity to panicky banks in 2008. Second, birds have survived much hotter earth temperatures when plants thrived, eventually forming coal and oil. Your fear of climate change reveals your ignorance.
1127 2018-07-26 21:25:07 #pnpcbc Nfld will make 3.5 billion off its carbon/oil investment? That might cover the cost of relocating the St. John's population when the city is flooded due to global warming. Good planning!
1128 2018-07-26 21:24:40 Why would you attack the Mullahs in a Democratic fairly westernized society? The whole thing is ridiculous,  it's not about the Mullahs it's about the Straight of Hormuz, and the fact that they are the Saudis oil competition.
1129 2018-07-26 21:24:29 He is a bigot,and a bloody liar,he deserve no iota of respect, we know when and where to channel that to when conditions warrants so.

1131 2018-07-26 21:24:26 Putin is praying for $200 oil. His networth would double. This is why Russia is tolerant of Iran in Syria.

1133 2018-07-26 21:24:18 Vape oil? For anxiety / to help relax and also have you tried it if so what’s your opinion? Did it work to your benefit
1134 2018-07-26 21:24:17 え？早くねw
1135 2018-07-26 21:24:11 Yes. I guess my wonder is with other economies also very much dependent on oil. How did they proof against plummeting oil? Wealth funds?
1136 2018-07-26 21:24:10 What oil/gel did your mom use to braid his hair
1137 2018-07-26 21:24:07 I sincerely hope this isn't going to be a synthetic version & will be nothing less than pure oil? #Fibromyalgia #chronicpain #invisibleillness sufferers desperately need this for some quality of life as #meds don't work?  I hope this 'medicine' changes lives.
1138 2018-07-26 21:24:04 You don't have to go to the pub, you can research and find out about the concrete, rare earth, oil etc.
1139 2018-07-26 21:23:47 Price of gas per gallon: $2.77

1144 2018-07-26 21:23:09 So why can't we build refinery close to where we've crude oil in Nigeria & just get de product & refine it than building refinery where the raw material is not available? What is the rational behind this? Nigeria will sell crude oil to other countries & goes to buy frm Niger
1145 2018-07-26 21:23:06 @AndrewHolnessJM @BBCNews @itvnews @Channel4News @5_News @LBC @WritersofColour From October rules are to be relaxed that GPs will be able to give out some levels of Cannabis oil. ..Plants and research grown in Kent?from where?

1152 2018-07-26 21:22:14 The dollar is backed by debt, war, and oil. 

Bitcoin is backed by cryptography and secured with hash power. 

Yes value ultimately only exists in the mind, but there are also reasons, and a reason to move from one set of values to the other.

1162 2018-07-26 21:21:10 Once this new up cycle is done, a nasty 10+ dollar fall is in the works in my opinion. With long short ratio the way it is, it will be easy. I can't wait. Taking money from Andurand never felt so fun :)
1163 2018-07-26 21:21:09 It's been going on for some time guys. Shortly after the wands were installed, they were covered with oil and grease marks at the top. @EnfieldCouncil need to start monitoring the cycle lanes, or illegal parking will just get worse.

1167 2018-07-26 21:20:44 In 1937, the United Kingdom relied on whale oil for the following: 41% of all margarine produced, 28% of lard, and 16% of soap. So blue whales and fin whales were mostly killed for sandwiches.

1171 2018-07-26 21:20:31 And with due respect; being accurate does not make a statement banal. World oil demand increases by MM barrels per day every year, despite how much the left wishes it weren’t so. The choice is Canadian oil, or Saudi oil. That is what leadership is really about.
1172 2018-07-26 21:20:29 Yup!  The technology is always getting better.  We still have some gas generation here but the majority is hydro, Nuclear, and wind/solar.  Most heating is done with natural gas, though, except in very rural areas.  My grandmother's house still uses oil as gas is unavailable.
1173 2018-07-26 21:20:22 Given what Kelsey from Buzzfeed had to say about it (and given her pain is the literal worst there is), it'd be awesome if it were the oil
1174 2018-07-26 21:20:13 Today our top three energy sources globally are oil, coal and natural gas in that order. However, natural gas is the fastest growing fuel worldwide so by 2040 the top three energy sources are projected to be oil, natural gas and coal in that order.
1175 2018-07-26 21:20:11 CBD oil is already legal, they are now legalising medicinal cannabis which contains both CBD and THC. THC is the substance which causes the high and is currently illegal but for the cannabis to properly treat things such as epilepsy etc, both ingredients are needed.
1176 2018-07-26 21:20:06 It's only a thing if you spend your days spewing industry talking points. NL Libs and Tories are both addicted to oil and committed to doing as little as possible to reduce GHG emissions. Not even a semblance of balance

1178 2018-07-26 21:20:01 I watched one the other day, filmed in Canada I think, all the whales meet up there, wildlife is thriving. They've just been allowed to pass oil tankers through it. And whales struggle to hear them coming so they get hit. It'll all be decimated. It's fucking wrong.
1179 2018-07-26 21:19:58 He's confused about everything. How could he see her in that outfit before the hideaway and say "why is she wearing that". She took baby oil as well and he looked stressed

1204 2018-07-26 21:16:30 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
1205 2018-07-26 21:16:29 Every Oil Company who builds Pipelines should have you on their payroll! Perhaps our Prime Minister @JustinTrudeau will hire you now that we own a dinosaur of a pipeline. We're going to need your dogs.
1206 2018-07-26 21:16:27 countries hostage. He underscored the dangers of those countries dependence on Russian oil deliveries to keep their people warm during the winter leading to their inability to criticize Russia the rest of the year. The administration also offered to help identify..
1207 2018-07-26 21:16:21 Trumponics and reality like oil and vinegar.  Hard way to learn and hope they do, fast.
1208 2018-07-26 21:16:07 I think Vzla's hyperinflation & shortages are very much a byproduct of its price control regime as it is oil. & I think the world would only panic about global oil supply if it was a "swing producer" collapsing &/or if oil producers weren't able to offset the loss of production.
1209 2018-07-26 21:16:05 What about the little girl you left to die before you finally legalized the CBD oil? Big pharma is one hell of a campaign donor so who gives a damn right!? HEARTLESS. #EndProhibitionInWisconsin
1210 2018-07-26 21:16:01 My stepdad used to always put snake oil into our baseball mitts because he thought it'd loosen them up: it made them stiff as boards, but he just had so damn much of the stuff.
1211 2018-07-26 21:15:56 Whoever loves pleasure will become poor; whoever loves wine and olive oil will never be rich.

1214 2018-07-26 21:15:53 I'm not sure, but my guess would be the oil?
1215 2018-07-26 21:15:41 Having a hair dryer bonnet on to do a hot oil treatment while cutting out fabric. Lol
#cosplayingwhileblack #sewingwhileblack
1216 2018-07-26 21:15:36 Green oil? I didn't know that was a thing.
1217 2018-07-26 21:15:35 Sure, agree. But if someone lives somewhere like that, should we not be concerned? I'm not sure what you mean by "we don't tolerate it" - generally means I live a life of privilege - which is fine, but show some kindness to those with less than you.
1218 2018-07-26 21:15:14 These free cah washes and oil changes be coming in handy dawg
1219 2018-07-26 21:15:13 before y’all post them nails up here slap some oil on them cuticles bc that dry shit takes away from the whole aesthetic
1220 2018-07-26 21:15:04 Trump’s trade policies have already deep-sixed many of the people who bought into his “Snake Oil” sales pitch. The perfect storm is coming, Donnie. You’d better take a couple extra pairs of Depends...you’re going to need them.
1221 2018-07-26 21:14:51 Pero fue, al peñarol y al Fluminense, algo ha de ver tenido de bueno, o los brasileños son tontos, al menos en esos años muy pocos llegaban al fútbol de Brasil
1222 2018-07-26 21:14:51 Fun talk now @PnPCBC @VassyKapelos on border issues.Seems that msm calls them ‘irregular migrants’ and Govt of Ont says ‘illegal border crossers’.What say you?And how ‘bout that huge oil project in NFLD w/govt backing?Are you or?Tell us on TV or CBC FB
1223 2018-07-26 21:14:46 Omg I want to get high while listening to Sophie's Oil of Every Pearl's Un-Insides album, we stan the concept
1224 2018-07-26 21:14:46 I didn't even in your family get castor oil for worldbuilding omg this tea tastes just celebrate how i'm a dolphin how good
1225 2018-07-26 21:14:42 LMAO sis in my interview was just like “I love you hairrrr, I’ve been trying to grow mine foreverrrr” I’m like “omg yeah coconut oil works wonders” sis, this is a 20” closure and three 24’s

1228 2018-07-26 21:14:36 Tried spraying a spider with a special essential oil spray I made but now he’s just back at his web with more open chakras :(
1229 2018-07-26 21:14:36 oh that's very good to know, my skin isn't great with too much oil.
1230 2018-07-26 21:14:36 So why are you fast tracked by fracking and acidization,  promoting oil exploration when the bore holes are going throught aquifers that feed our water supply ( 70 000 dorking by residents) and 9’unexplsined earthquakes in a region in which they are virtually unknown.
1231 2018-07-26 21:14:34 I get where you’re coming from, but an emulsion of yolks and oil is not the same as a custard. They both may contain yolks, but that’s the only  similarity. Still, mayo ice cream is a nasty concept.
1232 2018-07-26 21:14:24 Because here in South Carolina, our largest source of revenue is tourism. Nobody wants to come to oil covered beach for vacation. Not to mention studies have already shown, REPEATEDLY, that the cost of offshore drilling far outweighs the benefit. There's not that much out there!
1233 2018-07-26 21:14:23 i love my face after I lather that shit in coconut oil
1234 2018-07-26 21:14:21 Shares in Monster Munch, Mars Bars & Umbongo rocket as the UK approves Cannabis Oil.
1235 2018-07-26 21:14:12 The concept of a single asset ETF that is relatively easy to purchase and store with low cost separates BTC from other single asset ETFs such as gold or oil.

1241 2018-07-26 21:13:58 Every acceleration of a combustion vehicle releases carcinogenic fumes into the air. Every time a vehicle is stopped, tiny bits of metal, rubber & oil are released from brake pads/tires/suspension. Vehicles can start/stop over 40 times per mile during rush hour
#StartStopIdling
1242 2018-07-26 21:13:50 yes the forests are nice for walking, but we also need to think about the flora and fauna. Animals will prosper more in broad-leaf forests. The water and oil will be healthier -
1243 2018-07-26 21:13:49 “Hmmm.....You’re Fine, I guess. I’ll just go take a nap”
1244 2018-07-26 21:13:45 Well,  here's how I see it. After all of those years of oil production here in a province with a tiny population of a small city, we are on the verge of bankruptcy. We were better off when Joey Smallwood was Premier. So what's the big deal about another oil project?
1245 2018-07-26 21:13:41 I drive, I've never seen a needle anywhere where I live. We dont tolerate it. No homeless either.
Pretty pathetic when you live somewhere that stepping on a needle is even a consideration or a common hazard.
1246 2018-07-26 21:13:37 Wow, Sounds like I need to move back home to Texas.. big oil money coming back to Houston.. I'm dying up here in chicago... liberal wasteland.

1248 2018-07-26 21:13:30 I clearly wasn’t thinking and put olive oil in the fridge instead of the cabinet then just drove myself crazy looking for it. I’m losing my mind 
1249 2018-07-26 21:13:21 Google it you can get it at a natural shop idk aunt Rena does. It’s basically 100% of coconut oil but we use the bullet and blend it with trivia , teaspoon of butter hot unsweetened tea and sugar free caramel syrup and the a little bit of whipping cream it’s so goooood

1252 2018-07-26 21:13:12 Following the nerve agent attack the president expelled 60 Russian diplomats from US soil. Afterwards other countries followed by also expelling others(America First)

6)During a speech last year in Poland Trump lambasted Russia for using oil to hold NATO's Eastern European..
1253 2018-07-26 21:13:07 Yelp is so irritating. People—criticizing a Chinese dish for being too oily when the literal translation of the dish is “hot oil noodles” makes you look pretty arrogant/dumb. Maybe dial back those confident pronouncements a touch
1254 2018-07-26 21:13:03 Yep. Among other things, my dad had the local postmistress offering him CBD oil to cure his cancer. 

My dad took it all in his stride but all the quack advice caused and causes huge distress for my mum. 

It’s heartbreaking tbh and I cant imagine how other folks cope
1255 2018-07-26 21:13:02 ทำคุณบูชาโทษ
1256 2018-07-26 21:12:54 Every time the media puts out negative reports against Trump, I just think how right I was to vote for him. Think where we would be if Hillary had won the election. Higher taxes, speaking farce, Russia would have more of our uranium, and we would still be oil dependant
1257 2018-07-26 21:12:52 Jajajaja hablas del gran Polo Carrera que solo brillaba en Liga porque fue al Peñarol un fracaso.

1259 2018-07-26 21:12:29 on the one hand this involves literally destroying some of the last unspoiled parts of the world

... but on the other it's to dig up oil and gas which, when burned, will destroy every part of the world
1260 2018-07-26 21:12:28 annoying ants? layout a trail of peppermint oil, they won’t cross or go near it. instead of using chemicals/bug sprays in your home.
1261 2018-07-26 21:12:18 In this era of Trumponomics and Russia (oil), expect anything
1262 2018-07-26 21:12:16 Amazing vegan snack tip I don’t see enough: kale, in olive oil, liberal salt and chilli flakes, bake in the oven for 20 mins at 150, it’s amazing
1263 2018-07-26 21:12:07 Well-Regarding #PolarEnergyInc oil spill on our property last year, company we hired to clean up is refusing to give all documents & reports to our attorney. Reason: Though we have a #Contract w them Moran claims they worked for #FederatedInsurance not us. Federated insures Polar
1264 2018-07-26 21:12:07 Why are they allowed to drive here ?
They cant drive or park.
Car mirrors are not for makeup.
That light in the dash isnt aladins lamp but no oil warning.
1265 2018-07-26 21:12:02 Since BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA has been out of the White House,  Al-Qaeda & ISIS has been quiet, not driving brand new Toyota trucks, not using U.S bomb materials, don't see ISIS driving semi trailer tankers full of oil,  ect. Wierd really.

1269 2018-07-26 21:11:37 Have you ever applied oil to another man’s feet @tomosullivan93
1270 2018-07-26 21:11:35 put alma oil in my hair and had this sudden wave of nostalgia back to when my mum used to use it 
1271 2018-07-26 21:11:27 no one ever said snake oil salesmen aren't charismatic, entertaining, funny, & enjoyable to be around (as long as you aren't their mark).  they are all those things.
1272 2018-07-26 21:11:20 Why did I let Jerry change my oil 
1273 2018-07-26 21:11:18 Olive oil is incredibly scandalous. I had no idea
1274 2018-07-26 21:11:10 Business like big oil which give millions in lobby money to the likes of Senate Majority Leader McConnell?
1275 2018-07-26 21:11:06 is there any reason not to deep fry pizza?

it's in the bible, after all.

'And he gaveth unto them the oil, so that they may fry, and within that oil the Israelites dippeth the pizza pie, and yea, it was righteous'
1276 2018-07-26 21:11:01 Idek whi the person is first of all my squad is small cause people in Lompoc let bullshit flow out their mouths like and oil leak but like it’s a fucking song
1277 2018-07-26 21:10:58 I can see you are clueless about GERS.
It shows clearly stated *notional* geographic and demographic shares of Oil and gas revenues.
Look up that word: notional...
1278 2018-07-26 21:10:57 Todays liberals need to watch the History channel about the "Men who Built America!" Standard Oil, The railways, the shipping companies. It was all a great time that is happening again right now with Donald J. Trump. They built the country and Trump is reviving the USA!
1279 2018-07-26 21:10:27 yes...but it is never straight up or down..and plenty of 100+ ticks intraday opportunites.

1283 2018-07-26 21:10:08 Good news coming through on Cannabis oil, about time!!!
1284 2018-07-26 21:10:05 How can they suddenly allow cannabis oil for children but deny adults for months and let them die without allowing a trial test?
1285 2018-07-26 21:10:05 おっぱいって結局は脂肪だろ？少し胸についてるからって僕を巨乳キャラにするなよ。
1286 2018-07-26 21:09:56 Eyebrow growth serum 1:
1. Fill a container with 1/4 of castor oil
2. 1/4 of vitamin E oil
3. 1/4 aloe Vera gel
4. Mix it all together as well as you can and with a spoolie/ old mascara wand/ toothbrush apply to your brows/lashes every night before bed. Rinse off in the morning
1287 2018-07-26 21:09:54 Technically just garlic and oil but usually you get the egg yolks now. I think the richness (from olive oil) makes it different from mayo.
1288 2018-07-26 21:09:49 Baby oil on the hands...and a live feed on PPV!
1289 2018-07-26 21:09:46 Mi top 5 es Spencer, Valencia, Méndez, Ulises y Cevallos, de ahí vienen Aguinaga, Capurro, Chucho Benítez, Italo Estupiñan, el Gran Polo Carrera. En el orden que sea después del top 5
1290 2018-07-26 21:09:33 People seem to use it interchangeably with mayo now, but originally it meant a condiment made with just garlic and oil (the name literally means “garlic and oil” in Catalan IIRC).
1291 2018-07-26 21:09:27 Yes, the Republican front group’s are larger and have better funding. They work for billionaires and oil companies.
1292 2018-07-26 21:09:25 저두 넘 맘 아프구 그래요 남 아이돌 파기 힘든것...

1293 2018-07-26 21:09:23 ねむい、
1294 2018-07-26 21:09:15 Don't forget the oil spill cleanup jobs! The BP Horizon was a real boost to the Gulf coast economy, am I right? And the workers that will get sick from the PAH poisoning will stimulate the healthcare sector for decades to come. Shouldn't we do better than that?
1295 2018-07-26 21:09:10 Stop propaganda. A million innocents in 3 staunchly anti-Jihadi countries of Iraq, Libya and Syria died- all 3 had nothing to do with Sep 11. You destroyed secular syria for oil,Iran and golan heights. This chaos led to IS and refugee crisis. Dare to touch the Jihadis in Saudi!
1296 2018-07-26 21:09:06 Coconut water, coconut oil.
1297 2018-07-26 21:09:06 Notice how she said venesaula but didn’t mention Big Oil, the cia or Neo Liberal colonization as well as Authoritarian Sicialism. Then Joy named other countries- and Meghan said those were small countries? Meanwhile Venezuela is a small country under attack by imperialism. Hehe!
1298 2018-07-26 21:08:50 1. Bay du Nord's total recoverable reserves are equivalent to three days of global oil consumption. In the grand scheme of things, these emissions are insignificant.
1299 2018-07-26 21:08:49 @ZinhleManzini i see on instagram that you also use tea tree oil. I have just recently started using it with lavender and jojoba. I'm just not sure if its ok to bath with all of them twice a day.
1300 2018-07-26 21:08:49 Nigga gotta get an oil change ASAP
1301 2018-07-26 21:08:41 Back at hometown again I guess I’m rewatching Genrakugo no Shinjuu while I do coconut hot oil treatment.
1302 2018-07-26 21:08:35 By expanding tar sands production and building a pipeline to sell that dirty oil to Asia? Is that what you mean?
1303 2018-07-26 21:08:33 They are aphids - use pest oil spray can buy it at the supermarket
1304 2018-07-26 21:08:10 I have a hard time believing they would trumpet this so loudly a month in advance. I wonder what the threat even of trump bombing iran will do to oil prices
1305 2018-07-26 21:07:54 I call  .  If Trump bombs Iran, the Middle East goes up in flames, oil goes to $150+/barrel, Republicans lose the entire Congress & Trump is impeached & possibly removed.   Trump is not a kamikaze, even for Israel.
1306 2018-07-26 21:07:54 Made some chilli oil with my home grown and dried standard chillis (wasn't bad). Have some dried Carolina Reapers and some Dorest Nagas for the next two batches.
1307 2018-07-26 21:07:46 Having read other comments there are loads of things I’ve forgotten. Rice olive oil loo rolls sugar chocolate and if like Y2K it doesn’t happen (thanks to me and other computer programmers who put in lots of overtime) then you were prepared
1308 2018-07-26 21:07:43 Which one of you dudes said Lucas Oil acoustics are hot shit? I gotta tell you, if you think that then you obviously never heard a show in the old RCA dome!
1309 2018-07-26 21:07:39 Equivocado es por logros, dos ligas holandesas, una super copa Holandesa, jugó 4 eliminatorias y Ecuador calificó a 3 de ellas a los mundiales, campeón de la Sudamericana siendo figura. Si esos no son logros, me olvidó marco el gol con el q Ecuador ganó por 1ra vez en un mundial
1310 2018-07-26 21:07:22 After he destroyed it!! 

what a sham! Snake oil is his specialty

1312 2018-07-26 21:06:57 i got called lazy for having dreadlocks. obviously you haven’t had to deal with the high maintenance of dreads. or the anxiety of all the fluffies or never had to spray your head twice a day with essential oils and go inbetween every part with a scalp oil. YOU DONT KNOW.
1313 2018-07-26 21:06:57 I feel bad for the guy changing my oil. He has to see how trashy my car is
1314 2018-07-26 21:06:40 India should not import oil from Muslims because they eat Beef.
How Hindu's will use it  ? 
1315 2018-07-26 21:06:35 IT’S TAKEN 2 1/2 HOURS FOR AN OIL CHANGE AND I’M SOOOO BOOOOREEEDDDDD
1316 2018-07-26 21:06:28 You paid $150 for a four hour rental of a pontoon on PC Beach? Was this right after the oil spill a few years ago because that really can't be right otherwise. Cheapest my wife's company has is $250 through their vendors and that's with a discount.
1317 2018-07-26 21:06:25 Ima get full of that oil & go get my tongue pierced.
1318 2018-07-26 21:06:24 It's not what I *think* is happening to the profits, it's what we *know* is happening.
Investors shield their shareholdings in shell accounts in the BVI et. al. and pay no tax. That's only one aspect.
Oil isn't just petroleum, it's the basis of over 6,000 products...
1319 2018-07-26 21:06:22 where/when will this oil wrestling video be available?
1320 2018-07-26 21:06:19 The world worries me atm....... Idk what we even can do atm..... In the end I feel it is the BIG people who need to do stuff.
Factories, Oil and gas  and so on..... Cause this is SHIT.
1321 2018-07-26 21:06:07 The first bit is questionable... it's not Classic Empire with a map coloured in red, but unfortunately we are still doing quite a bit of financial imperialism stealing oil and sponsoring foreign Wars all over the world.
1322 2018-07-26 21:06:05 Oils:
1. Soak a cotton ball in castor oil and apply on each eyebrow. Leave on overnight and rinse off with warm water in the morning. 
2. Do the same with coconut oil and olive oil.
1323 2018-07-26 21:06:01 Sell your snake oil elsewhere
1324 2018-07-26 21:05:55 Having an oil slick for a face is the worst.

1328 2018-07-26 21:05:32 Mayo is egg yolk and oil blended very quickly.  Ice Cream is egg yolk and cream(fat) blended in a freezer.

This is a lesson in labeling and preconceived perceptions.
1329 2018-07-26 21:05:26 I’m reading a recipe to copy Panda Express’s fried rice and one of the ingredients is “1/4 teaspoon sesame oil (or more to taste)”. Or more to taste? How is that a good suggestion in a copycat recipe? You want me to make a judgement call? Am I a certified Panda cook? No.

1331 2018-07-26 21:05:16 Bipartisanship (noun) - When the Democrats and Republicans team up on something and the media froths over it while ignoring the fact that the majority of the people will get screwed.

The benefits go to Wall Street, Silicon Valley, Big Pharma, Big Banks, oil, coal, gas, military.
1332 2018-07-26 21:05:12 Deep cleaned my car, got an oil change and filled my tank today . It’s a good day 
1333 2018-07-26 21:05:08 I literally just spent the ten minutes daydreaming about putting one tube of every Windsor and Newton oil paint colour in a shopping basket. It's time to stop for the evening.

1338 2018-07-26 21:03:35 And can ‘69 even be attributed to Nixon? The budget was set prior to him entering office. He massively increased spending year over year without any major attributable reason outside of a small recession at the start. The oil crisis didn’t really hit until after his term.
1339 2018-07-26 21:03:34 Rick Scott: why don't we have Medicaid expansion?  Why are our schools suffering? What about your stand on gun control? Have you secured the ban on oil drilling?

Not only no, but hell no for Senate. Don't need another Trump toady.
1340 2018-07-26 21:03:28 All that's needed is a oil spill..stop drilling..money hungry

1342 2018-07-26 21:03:21 All Detroit needs is (1) OIL for Republicans can take credit for creating, and, (2) all Texas needs is for OIL to tank, like the old auto industry, and, you could continue playing your next round of Seal Team Six. #MAGAt
1343 2018-07-26 21:03:15 It's illegal for private companies to build utility scale wind projects in Newfoundland and Labrador. 

Meanwhile today @PremierofNL @DwightBallMHA called NL the greenest place to get oil.

NL is a fucked up petrostate with oil addicted government regardless of party stripe.

1345 2018-07-26 21:02:53 the Houthis attacked two Saudi oil tankers prompting Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil company to temporarily halt shipments. ! Is this true or fake ? Tell us it is fake 
1346 2018-07-26 21:02:49 C'mon bro.  Big Oil and the Koch's need to track us down to send the checks so we use the hastag to signal each other our wherabouts.  We're like DeNiro in Heat, we need to be ready to move in case you guys track us down.
1347 2018-07-26 21:02:41 Ever think this is just a ploy to gain leverage? 
If the Chi Coms think we will support the bean growers that negates any leverage they have.

1354 2018-07-26 21:02:03 This evening a good friend was bemoaning that oil for his car was for sale at a well known supermarket, half price, at £22 for 5 litres. I smiled, commiserated and then put my arm round his shoulder and said, “I don’t have to worry about putting oil in a car anymore.”  #EV

1367 2018-07-26 21:00:55 I baked my falafel instead of frying it because I'm trying to cut down on my use of oil. Honestly not everything is meant to be healthy because it was dry and no amount of hummus was saving it.

1369 2018-07-26 21:00:35 1)So we have zero plan to move towards the renewable energy economy the world esp China is working towards. Green investments were out performing oil energy in terms of capital investment. Business would do better if energy costs decreased due to Green energy tech.

1373 2018-07-26 21:00:17 Well oil & gas price up about 1/3 since last fall, and tariffs starting to hurt, and I doubt Dodd-Frank has done much to keep the new bubble from getting bigger than the last one, and my neighborhood is going condo as fast as it can, so the whole edifice is yes, fragile.
1374 2018-07-26 21:00:16 Also man I swear this Argan oil and new conditioner got me feeling gorgeous
1375 2018-07-26 21:00:10 Coconut oil is very healthy. It is high in special fats called medium chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently than other fats

1385 2018-07-26 20:58:19 have you considered getting an essential oil diffuser?

1387 2018-07-26 20:57:43 Not to include they mostly focused on “freeing” areas that have oil or sea ports
1388 2018-07-26 20:57:43 All those Labour people panicking about upsetting the 2016 52% should really be sorry about upsetting the 2019 90%. They are all still alive and they are starting to understand that they were sold snake oil. “But I respected democracy” ain’t gonna wash.
1389 2018-07-26 20:57:35 "no child should die before their parents."

1391 2018-07-26 20:56:55 Why is oil important? Why is gas important? Those are the most vital questions and most in our industry have absolutely no clue how to answer it, including those involved in producing them. That’s our problem.

A few days ago whilst eating dinner with the fam, my Dad asked me to hand over the butter.

So I took the piss a bit and grabbed the olive oil and pretended to pour it on his chicken, when I accidentally did do it...

He didn't talk to me for around 16 hours after

1398 2018-07-26 20:55:45 Mr Burns, the future energy plan is very complex & must dovetail renewables with conservation & we’ll still need oil & gas. Am I still employed? sincerely, Smithers.
1399 2018-07-26 20:55:34 Or...
We might start by Nationalizing, then breaking up the Oil Corporations, the Banks and the Military industrial complex, and redirecting all wealth generated by working people towards the needs of working people?

We can worry about Mars after we unf*ck the Earth
1400 2018-07-26 20:55:26 What’s more stressful? Driving around 5,000 miles overdue on your oil change or actually getting your oil changed and dealing with the sales pressure? (Spoiler alert: it’s the second one.)
1401 2018-07-26 20:55:21 Oil must be cost about 25 percent from of goods prices. Because not correct buy oil very cheaply for 75 $ for barrel and do and sell goods at the cost of 10 000 $.
1402 2018-07-26 20:55:10 The numbers look defensible, but what you're leaving out is the bureaucratic infrastructure that needs to be in place to determine eligibility and disbursement amounts. A quick look shows Dept of Ag has 105K employees. This program is like changing the course of an oil tanker
1403 2018-07-26 20:55:00 DYK that El Segundo (the second) got its name because it was the site of the 2nd  Standard Oil refinery?

1406 2018-07-26 20:54:52 Exactly how is the pipeline going to taint drinking water? You know there has been a pipeline from Alberta to the coast already for over 35 years right? Do you taste oil in your water yet?
1407 2018-07-26 20:54:51 Forgot I took a honey oil capsule  been sitting here for the last 30 mins wondering how the fuck I got high

1409 2018-07-26 20:54:47 Main drivers of deforestation are beef (grazing and soya for feed), palm oil and wood products.
Problem with avocados was gang related in one area. Don't even like them despite the stereotyping.
1410 2018-07-26 20:54:39 Suncor has different goals and metrics than Canada. Their goal is to produce as much oil as possible profitably, therefor the absolute increase in emissions, and their emissions per barrel produced are much lower, something that they measure themselves against and can achieve.
1411 2018-07-26 20:54:25 GOP is living in the dark ages. Our government needs a complete overhaul, not just an oil change.
1412 2018-07-26 20:54:24 I'd say what the small, 1900s era government did with Standard Oil was great. A model to follow.

You don't need a huge government to curtail monopolies. Just one that isn't filled with establishment hacks. They will be driven out as the old mainstream media dies.
1413 2018-07-26 20:54:23 Is the price for #2 fuel oil expected to be higher this winter than last? A year ago we did pre-buy for $2.08/gal, this year they want $2.73/gal for pre-buy. #vt #winter #fueloil #dontfreeze

1416 2018-07-26 20:54:04 Well God's Adviser you're a idiot. Cannabis Oil if used correctly can help treat terrible illnesses or diseases. It can stop a child suffering. Would want to see say your five-year child in terrible pain, or to have it taken away? Think before you type next time.
1417 2018-07-26 20:54:03 This latest discussion in Newfoundland Oil sounds nice because it's there just not practical investment by 2020 wont be worth much!!!

1419 2018-07-26 20:53:46 @ImranKhanPTI And in all Scandinavian countries like Sweden,Norway Finland Switzerland etc. Expand rapid economic and military ties with Russia. Set up new steel mills and Oil refineries. Shld target pakistan exports above 50 billion plus.
1420 2018-07-26 20:53:15 There was a time in #oil markets when a $10/b trading range was a big deal.
1421 2018-07-26 20:53:04 $5 oil change in Atlanta! Just a few miles from the AUC!
1422 2018-07-26 20:53:00 LOL. One of the great ironies of the green revolution is that in remote areas, crude oil is pumped from the ground by solar energy.
1423 2018-07-26 20:52:59 Your report on NTV about oil.. 

Poetry is about celebrating life,  celebrating that love, beauty and justice are more important than money.  Oil extraction contradicts that. Oil has brought war,  inequality and environmental degradation in Africa.

1464 2018-07-26 20:47:25 Coconut oil at minimum 2 Times a week for your hair is a must
1465 2018-07-26 20:47:24 So the house hasn’t had cooking oil for about a week so I went and bought cooking oil.... I come home put everything away and to my dismay. I forgot the cooking oil at the register....
1466 2018-07-26 20:47:10 “Oh, I have a really bad stomache, but I’ll be okay”
1467 2018-07-26 20:47:07 <packs bedroll, rations, oil lamp, 50' rope, and ten-foot pole>
1468 2018-07-26 20:47:06 Because typically the “socialist” u reference r left wing & those against r right. U mentioned oil prices dropping & how it effected a socialist country. I’m telling u that a place with a very capitalist attitude was hurt too & the biggest whiners here r very non socialist.
1469 2018-07-26 20:47:05 U should try an oil refinery in full nomex kit .....i felt for u on that beach  this morning #wheelsofindustrykeepturning
1470 2018-07-26 20:47:04 Me acordé de american oil memes jaja
1471 2018-07-26 20:46:58 I’ve run many oil spill and other pollution cleanup responses and worked in the Incident Command Sytem as SOSC of Texas repeatedly.  It’s not for  the faint hearted.
1472 2018-07-26 20:46:57 A yoruba somebody cooked this soup....too much oil.
1473 2018-07-26 20:46:54 .@SaudiEmbassyUSA & @UAEEmbassyUS, you can buy a few Arab-Americans w/a barrel of oil, but our community is not for sale. @adctweets @AAIUSA @ibishblog @rayhanania @GulfStatesInst

1476 2018-07-26 20:46:46 Our candidates are the only ones running committed to taking absolutely NO corporate money, or any money tied to the fossil fuel lobby.

Incumbents @SenBobCasey and @GovernorTomWolf can't say the same.

That's why they're so complacent on the issues of wars over oil & fracking!
1477 2018-07-26 20:46:45 Pass that snake oil pardner. We’ll get this horse on its feet..
1478 2018-07-26 20:46:35 Same, although I have no idea why I associate the smell of tea tree oil with OB but I know for sure that the taste of cinnamon is to do with my grandpère always baking. It’s fascinating how our brains can associate different tastes/foods/smells with something totally different
1479 2018-07-26 20:46:31 the world is litearlly on fire AGAIN.and all the locals can think about is that shiney new oil find that... probably none of them will see a penny of.
1480 2018-07-26 20:46:23 We make an ice-cream with rapeseed oil and eggs which is pretty much a mayonnaise base for ice-cream. Olive oil ice-cream is also popular in Italy.
1481 2018-07-26 20:46:10 Turns like a fully laden oil tanker.

1488 2018-07-26 20:45:35 Not big oil... Just us lil' 'ole small refiners trying to make ends meet in this unfair, unlevel playing field.  
1489 2018-07-26 20:44:41 Nami got a hold of my CBD oil & popped it now it’s all over my living floor.
1490 2018-07-26 20:44:26 I STILL need to oil my hair

1493 2018-07-26 20:44:12 Tim, nothing remotely approaches Venezuela. Oil may be a curse in that it can distort an economy but it was always thought an oil economy could not experience hyperinflation. So this is quite an achievement by Maduro and Co
1494 2018-07-26 20:44:12 Some bangers on that list.. Adnams, the Neck Oil..
1495 2018-07-26 20:43:55 Venezuela = multiple coup attempts by the US, deliberate strangulation of the economy, sanctions, and violent destabilization

Canada = makes money selling weapons to Saudi Arabia so they can strangle Yemeni people to death, extracts oil from Indigenous land
1496 2018-07-26 20:43:48 About blinking time!  Only medicinal products ‘derived’ from cannabis, so oil, from what I’ve read so far. Still, a step in the right direction.
1497 2018-07-26 20:43:48 10k prob doesn’t cover an oil change on the engines of that boat, if you can afford 40mill 10k doesn’t even register on your radar
1498 2018-07-26 20:43:43 i only believe in one god and that is coconut oil
1499 2018-07-26 20:43:37 There you have it.  Are you one of those hillbilly’s from JD Vance’s book who shout something they know is wrong because they just can’t stomach that their hero is nothing but a talentless snake oil salesman?
1500 2018-07-26 20:43:33 Why don’t you take care of the lead in public schools, housing, buildings in general instead of this useless lawsuit against oil companies. You fight useless battles and walk away from the real issues. Go light up another joint!
1501 2018-07-26 20:43:31 I guess the world isn’t awash in oil and gas enough.

1506 2018-07-26 20:42:58 The 3 metric tonnes of CO2 you wasted for fuel on your taxpayer funded jaunt on an NYPD anti-terrorism plane (about the equivalent of an average person in the Maldives - which is threatened by the global warming you are creating) certainly makes Big Oil happy! Hypocrite.
1507 2018-07-26 20:42:55 Haven't we put up with enough ignorance from Trump & Co.  Do we think that bad air and water won't hurt us?  Do we think destroying everything for the benefit of big gas & oil will be good for us?  But it is not us our gov't is worried about is it?
1508 2018-07-26 20:42:54 Scotland is allocated all oil and gas revenue generating within its waters under gers. But you know that already.

1517 2018-07-26 20:41:38 The gold reserves no longer backup the usd banknotes long ago.. it runs completely on the ideology “we are the USA, you can trust us”
#venezuela the country with largest oil reserves starts with #petrocoin to sell his oils.. and thats the future I like

1522 2018-07-26 20:41:08 The local newspapers and TV news stations are also firmly in the pocket of oil and gas and Trump. Facebook is a necessary evil here until someone comes up with something better for us.

1527 2018-07-26 20:40:39 China,in the middle of a trade war with the U.S. — started by Trump — is winding down its crude imports from the U.S. and switching to Iranian oil instead. Chinese petroleum products feature on the list of goods on which the U.S. has threatened to impose higher tariffs at a later

1529 2018-07-26 20:40:33 I hear oil has to be at least 50 dollars a barrel just for this whole thing to break even. So this is all up in the air at this point in time.  The project would be shelved if oil drops to around 50 dollars a barrel or less.
1530 2018-07-26 20:40:20 Somehow missed two #IPOs this morning. Anyway, the winner of seven-way contest for biggest pop is Chinese e-commerce co. $PDD, up 40.5%. Honorable mention to cybersecurity co. $TENB, up 31.5%. The loser is upstream oil co. $BRY, down 5.4%.
1531 2018-07-26 20:40:16 Just listening to James Brown. "Get on up like a sex machine "
I think I need an oil change

1533 2018-07-26 20:40:08 That is right taxpayers, we will spend as many millions of your dollars necessary to prove that our mental illness against oil companies whose products we use is valid.
1534 2018-07-26 20:40:00 Sprayed so much oil in my head lmao
1535 2018-07-26 20:39:46 New phrase. There are three types of lies: Lies, damn lies, and Biblically rationalized lies. @Franklin_Graham is a snake oil salesman masquerading as a Christian.
1536 2018-07-26 20:39:40 As I said, we follow, we do not lead and there is no desire for another intervention, especially as he was trying to get out of Afghanistan at the same time, was that intervention about Oil?

1538 2018-07-26 20:39:31 What is your thoughts on cannabis oil being promoted online, offline and at networking events ? Should networking groups allow this in groups?

1540 2018-07-26 20:39:10 Right now, the western world is going green in order to be less dependable on the Arab oil.
The Gulf Countries know that one day there will be no more oil to pump out. That's why they buy assets all over the world...
1541 2018-07-26 20:38:39 Castor oil has actually been studied and it really hasn’t been proven to work but also hasn’t been proven to be unsafe so it’s really whatever but I wouldn’t want diarrhea  My Midwife doesn’t induce so I’m good to go until baby decides they’re ready to come 
1542 2018-07-26 20:38:12 Indeed, even Team de Blasio seems to believe fossil fuel’s benefits outstrip its costs, since it continues to buy gas and oil for city-owned vehicles and buildings, while it is presumably fully aware of the consequences.
1543 2018-07-26 20:37:53 the OG oil painting!
1544 2018-07-26 20:37:20 I can’t the Prada candy dupe and the flowerbomb dupe. I ended up not getting a body oil cuz funds were low lol
1545 2018-07-26 20:37:17 @FBI OIL!!!
1546 2018-07-26 20:37:05 Are any other oil economies having similar issues as Venezuela: hyperinflation, shortages, etc.? 

Very curious about places like Nigeria, and elsewhere, that are also dependent on oil.
1547 2018-07-26 20:37:02 In the meantime Oregon is expunging canna convictions and records, has an amazing home grow/personal use policy and have ounces now starting from $30 US at many dispensaries...
Crickey you could make your own oil so damn cheap if you lived there!
1548 2018-07-26 20:36:44 Dude, that's somehow incredibly awesome to me.  Oh holy shit how much things will have/won't have changed in the meantime.  Wow.  OK, now I want a bit part as a snake oil salesman passing through on my way to the Klondike gold rush! I know how to handle a team.
1549 2018-07-26 20:36:33 I SAW WATER
1550 2018-07-26 20:36:33 Where is that from? In any case you can only go forward. Oil revenues now are low regardless of where they went to. So low in fact the GCR didn’t even factor them in.

1564 2018-07-26 20:35:35 The local paper said they were hiring people back in before the tariffs--something about increased demand for steel oil pipelines.

1574 2018-07-26 20:34:09 compared to what? Nordic countries have the benefit of being allies with the world's biggest powers and benefit from the global system - eg Sweden has a large arms industry, while Norway benefits from oil. Socialist countries made significant advance given their constraints

1583 2018-07-26 20:33:28 The Permian in West TX is pumping out 1.3 million barrels of oil a day, whereas the Niobrara is hitting 287,000 barrels per day. 
Add another 1.2 billion barrels of oil a day from the Eagle Ford in South TX, the desire to head out west is not high when hitting it so go elsewhere.

1601 2018-07-26 20:31:31 @beautyandplanet Hello! :) I really want to try your argan oil and lavender shampoo and conditioner as I heard it heard it helps with frizzy hair. Would there be somewhere I can get a sample or a smaller bottle so I can try it out?

1608 2018-07-26 20:30:42 i played the dice got in leading up to the earning. I am concerned if we are going to head down to 7-8s with this kind of management depsite oil going sideways or a bit higher. or take advantage of the price dip leading up to the remainder of the year and go long.
1609 2018-07-26 20:30:37 We are not giving up our fight to hold Big Oil accountable. We're appealing the dismissal of our lawsuit because corporate greed shouldn’t endanger our city’s future. Climate change is real. Big Oil knew it. They did nothing.

1613 2018-07-26 20:30:17 Volume of oil irrelevant if it’s too costly to extract. High oil price meant huge US shale investment. Now if they need it they just ramp up shale production. Also relentless green push will taper demand - number electric cars etc already growing.

1673 2018-07-26 20:21:58 Also the Venezuela point is just a deflection used to strawman left-leaning ideas. The problems in Venezuela can be traced back to the drop in oil prices and an authoritarian govt. Associating socialism with Venezuela is like associating capitalism with Pinochet's Chile.

1723 2018-07-26 20:15:39 Venezuela had the strongest economy in South America for decades. The price of oil rose and fell many times during that time. It isn't the price of oil. It's the fact that it, along with many other industries, was nationalized. It's the socialism.

1735 2018-07-26 20:14:52 Think about this.....

Oil is BLACK , it can make you the richest person on Earth , you are BLACK so what does that mean
1736 2018-07-26 20:14:45 coconut oil is comedogenic so it will clog your pores don’t do that
1737 2018-07-26 20:14:45 It really gets better after a couple of times I promise. Also an advice; use baby oil after you epilate it really soothes your skin

1750 2018-07-26 20:13:46 I still do a double glance when I see a old Peterbilt going down the road. I believe the big guy in our lot that I've seen transferring oil is a Peterbilt....has a really nice extended cab.

1755 2018-07-26 20:12:57 I'm weird in that my favorite scenes in superhero movies aren't fight scenes. The best scene in the newest Superman was when Clark saved those stranded oil rig workers. The best scene in Hancock was him carrying the cop to safety using the car as a shield.

1761 2018-07-26 20:12:34 Well, they may not just for Iran's sake but IF the oil flow is disrupted by an Iran-US war, China may respond as they get much of their oil from Iran.
And also Russia doesn't want a major war in that rea so they may try to stop it.
But IF they are attacked would respond too

1770 2018-07-26 20:11:39 I could have used you when I tried to get my oil filter off the other week.
1771 2018-07-26 20:11:37 Right. U.S. corrupted their leaders, made them arrest political opponents, made them steal oil money from the government. Go back to your Leftist school.
1772 2018-07-26 20:11:17 @totalkenya Which station has 0W - 20 synthetic oil?
1773 2018-07-26 20:11:15 Kinda funny you say that btw. Alberta (the most American wanna be of provinces here) was/is very O&G dependant. As soon as oil prices dropped, suddenly all the free market loving Cons were running around screaming “they sky is falling” and claiming everyone but themselves.
1774 2018-07-26 20:11:06 I go to a shop that barely has customers just to get a oil change and they tell me I need to change a bunch of other things in my car. I see what you're doing... No xei xei!

1796 2018-07-26 20:08:11 Tip of the day: don’t skip washing your face before bed! Your skin and pores collect dirt and oil throughout the day. Fight breakouts and irritation by washing up before bed. 
1797 2018-07-26 20:07:52 I get it. But change your thinking. First of all, are they shooting up when train is moving? Second, lots of lighting. Third, many fewer dangerous people in back alleys. I don't advocate for drug use. Needles on a train is awful. Let's change scenario so doesn't happen unsafely.
1798 2018-07-26 20:07:51 castor oil works super well!

Love you!!

If you think about it, mayo is oil + eggs + acid. That shows up in a lot of sweet baked goods. Make an ice cream, so you're adding milk + sugar, and you're pretty much in the "this goes in a cake" zone. ;)
1806 2018-07-26 20:06:42 Job ad: Fanny waxers assistant. Job includes removing ladies knickers, prepare fanny for waxing & rub oil after waxing.

No, they said - that's where the back of the queue is!

It was 50% lower than previous tests.  He was taking CBD for sleep, so this was a wonderful surprise!  #PSA #prostate
1813 2018-07-26 20:05:29 And we also don’t deserve a leader who puts the profits of the oil and gas industry over the safety of Pennsylvanians and our right to clean air and pure water and refuses to listen us.

1821 2018-07-26 20:04:11 White people are the only people that will trophy hunt, kill the poor, destroy nature and our environment w their oil/coal plantations but flip the fuck out if a woman has an abortion or god forbid if people of color have the same rights as them
1822 2018-07-26 20:04:09 crazy that right after the car was invented, they found this thing called "oil" and used that to power the car + tons of oil was found after that
i am very smart

1824 2018-07-26 20:03:52 More enjoyable to suck castor oil straight from the beaver than to eat a licorice NECCO.
1825 2018-07-26 20:03:39 No disrespect intended,  but how is a moving train car safer than a nonmoving back alley when shooting up?

1832 2018-07-26 20:02:45 I just want to run down a grand staircase of a 12th-century castle lined with oil lamps while wearing silk robes is that too much to ask

1838 2018-07-26 20:01:46 WHAT??!! You mean to tell me I purchased two of the @KrazyEssentials perfume oils before they sold out yesterday? Luck was on my side I didn’t even know they’d launched. I went on the site to get a dry body oil and just happened to see them and snagged . Good looking out God!

1848 2018-07-26 20:00:06 I mean the Americans don't want to sell all their refined product to just us. They want a large base to sell to. Canadian oil gets sold at a discount because our market of buyers is small right now cause we can't get it out of the country

1858 2018-07-26 19:59:02 Yes we need to tap the countries tremendous  untapped potential.
Off shore oil is one of the truly tremendous untapped potentials of America.
You always vote to block it.

1869 2018-07-26 19:57:22 A big mistake by Russia to have sold Alaska for peanuts to US a century ago. Otherwise today Russia, like Canada would be neighbours to US & would have been selling oil & gas to US.
1870 2018-07-26 19:57:19 You believe in Trump. Same difference. Except yours is a snake oil salesman with a history of bankruptcies and lying and extramarital affaires. That horse doesn’t look too high, does it?

1873 2018-07-26 19:56:27 Are you serious that looks like something called halwa that Somalis make. It's made out of sugar and oil right?
1874 2018-07-26 19:56:22 Also, oil and cream are different
1875 2018-07-26 19:56:19 Coconut oil?? It’s vegetable oil I know of, it reduces the sticking to the hand
1876 2018-07-26 19:56:13 I smell like motor oil
1877 2018-07-26 19:56:10 A roux,  heated vegetable oil and flour you have to quickly stir it or it’ll burn. It thicken sauces but too much flour and it’s a flop lol
1878 2018-07-26 19:56:06 It's been my experience that commentary rooted in the modern Peak Oil mindset *must* not objectively consider nuclear energy, because it clashes with the fundamental framing of looming hyper-scarcity.
1879 2018-07-26 19:56:04 There is always opportunity in any market for those who look.  Tariffs will affect many things besides just grains & oil crop, & equipment costs.  Slow the game down, don’t get emotional about the rhetoric, focus on what we can control & plan for what can be done.
1880 2018-07-26 19:55:44 Question to @LisaDaftari : Why should Americans continue to deny Canadian oil access to tidewater? Check with @FriendsOScience as to who are the Americans who are not friends to Canada. Plus @OilsandsAction
1881 2018-07-26 19:55:40 The belief that shale will ramp up production again is strong. However, Permian oil is 79% and gas 65% in decline. Appalachian decline rose from 25% to 38% this year and will be likely at 60% next year. Niobrara oil decline is already 100% per year. The numbers are getting big.
1882 2018-07-26 19:55:38 I had great hopes for Ghaddafi and Hussein but those neo-cons spoiled that for everyone.  If the oil price spikes again I'll get a couple game tapes off to Russia or the Gulf.  If the Iranians work out how much league pisses off the English upper classes there is potential there.
1883 2018-07-26 19:55:18 had an appointment at 2 for an oil change and it’s now 4 & i’m just now leaving  why @subaru_usa
1884 2018-07-26 19:54:57 what about the genocide of leftists across the developing world from Vietnam to Chile to Indonesia.... or the impacts of capitalism favouring unhealthy food, or the impacts of still using oil when we could have gone green decades ago, the famines in post colonial africa...
1885 2018-07-26 19:54:40 That Oil should not leave Turkana, Moi gave them Guns to protect their resources. If we had the same in luo land the police would not kill our brothers and sisters like dogs every five cycle.
1886 2018-07-26 19:54:06 Hot oil?
1887 2018-07-26 19:53:40 Fuck synthetic oil lol
1888 2018-07-26 19:53:25 We develop natural resources for the wealth we can create – there is no inherent need to develop anything other than wealth creation.  If it does not make money oil will not pumped out and trees will not be cut down.
1889 2018-07-26 19:53:19 Absolutely if you happen to own an oil company ..but for your average Joe who gets so worked up about it?
1890 2018-07-26 19:53:18 I went to walmart to get my oil changed & then left with three fish but as soon as i got in the car i started crying bc i took them away from their family. how’s your day going?
1891 2018-07-26 19:53:04 Target needs to start doing oil changes
1892 2018-07-26 19:52:57 Ca... lemme bust out the holy oil.
1893 2018-07-26 19:52:55 My understanding is that our refineries in eastern Canada cannot process oil sands crude without unacceptable upgrading costs. If so how would Energy East reduce our imports?
1894 2018-07-26 19:52:51 Every summer oik change I do, the auto parts store always runs a special. Get you're oil, filter, rags, hand cleaner, and oil drain pain for like $40. Lol I have like 10 fucking drain pains, but it's cheaper to get the special lol
1895 2018-07-26 19:52:40 People act like coconut oil is the Messiah of skincare but I once got it in my eye and was blind out of it for a day and half soo???
1896 2018-07-26 19:52:39 Warm some olive oil and pop a few drops in yer ear. Plug it with some cotton wool and take plenty of Tylenol and drink hot fluids to warm the ear canal further. I hope it feels better soon :)

1903 2018-07-26 19:51:01 Well, the thing is, it doesn’t. England and France are virtually bankrupt. The Scandinavian countries are subsidizing it with revenue from North Sea oil, which has a finite life span. There is no free lunch. A few years ago I needed a heart procedure and my friend’s mother, 1/2

1914 2018-07-26 19:49:53 Putin and Trump are Business Partners (Mainly Oil) and Russia and America are their Businesses. They both have their sticky little fingers on buttons that can 'blow-up the World' so they have the upper-hand. Putin/Trump have both got investments in Oil Pipelines & oil in US & Ru
1915 2018-07-26 19:49:50 Since we now are the biggest producers of oil and gas in the old countries it went to the heads of state,and leaders of the country in America who gets it?

1922 2018-07-26 19:49:12 YES! And the oil from sundried tomatoes.
1923 2018-07-26 19:49:02 You just cut them on a bias (diagonal chips 1/4 in thick) then fry them in oil for  1-1.5 minutes on each side. (You can bake them too, but they’ll turn out completely different) After frying, drain on a paper towel. Sprinkle with a bit of sea salt if you’d like and enjoy.

1926 2018-07-26 19:48:48 Please? They could really use the help. Even the small town auto shop I stopped at to get an oil change before I left is just...gone.... many people have lost their homes and jobs. Please cover this story.
1927 2018-07-26 19:48:44 Considering how the valuation of oil fluctuates, not sure this is the best way to demonstrate it. ;)

1929 2018-07-26 19:48:14 In the form of cannabis oil for exceptional cases  for recreational use 
1930 2018-07-26 19:48:11 Plus plenty mucho gas, oil, and not a little gold bullion.
1931 2018-07-26 19:48:04 Y créanme, el BIO OIL es una ayuda extra la hijuemama.
1932 2018-07-26 19:47:55 It’s no good. The petro probably isn’t backed by oil at all. The whole thing is dubious. Anyone who is serious about this would make a Bitcoin-backed national currency. Otherwise, it’s just a pretence.
1933 2018-07-26 19:47:52 Salt & Straw has an olive oil ice cream that is my very favorite, texture-wise. It’s incredible.
1934 2018-07-26 19:47:51 No makeup remover? Coconut oil. Dry skin? Coconut oil. DIY hair mask? Coconut oil.

1938 2018-07-26 19:47:31 Lol, nah try them. They good. You can roast them or pan sear them with some olive oil.
1939 2018-07-26 19:47:23 Economic dependence unavoidable given need for natural resources necessary for technological development, e.g. even after end of fossil fuel vehicles plastic still needs oil. The question now is not about ending dependence, it's about ending exploitation.
1940 2018-07-26 19:47:17 In 2010 I was in Djibouti as part of the EU anti piracy operations. As well as EU warships there were also Japanese Russian and NATO  participants. Everybody needs oil I’m guessing all forces will wish to protect it even just for self interest
1941 2018-07-26 19:47:10 His shoulder, watching the bustle of the city below them. "Lube?" He muttered against the other's ear. There was a soft chuckle. "We used to use olive oil."

1943 2018-07-26 19:46:57 Obviously you are supported by the oil and gas companies. We need a governor who will seek a future best for future generations.

1947 2018-07-26 19:46:08 I can’t say how the coal jobs are doing since I’ve only met one engineer that worked in coal but oil and gas are doing so well they can’t build hotels fast enough. So yeah it’s working.
1948 2018-07-26 19:45:48 Hi Wells, We're committed to using only the most sustainable sources of palm oil in our products. We have removed it wherever possible and 100% of the palm oil used in M&S products is RSPO certified. Thanks, Jake.
1949 2018-07-26 19:45:47 Just been told they're talking about an oil with no recreational applications... they claim.

I'm gonna make the dankest salad.

1955 2018-07-26 19:44:46 This is serious! The world ran out of oil 30 years ago and still doesn't know it!
1956 2018-07-26 19:44:41 No such thing but there might have been a bulletin regarding the issue. Recalls are for dangerous stuff like defenders being fitted with faulty oil pumps. Owners are written too via DVLA etc
1957 2018-07-26 19:44:34 Really? Swinney raised concerns about the ability to pay pensions at uk rates, in a report which the SNP tried to hide.

And that was before the oil revenues plummeted.

1960 2018-07-26 19:44:13 My friend and I have been texting about how to put it together. I think it takes a lightly warmed oven, a spritz of oil (I think I’m going to look for a spray oil) and then a dusting of furikake and just putting it in the oven for a minute. Maybe you can skip the oven part
1961 2018-07-26 19:44:10 An oil company is giving people money for FACEs to create The Bond. I think Petro Canada is starting a service to help people find others to kiss.

2017 2018-07-26 19:38:17 You are back from the hurricane that rock your party Pls @channelstv is not the senators and Rep members that defected so leave my darling station out of your troubles Just advice your labour leader to keep negotiating our oil blocs to the aggrieved members
2018 2018-07-26 19:38:15 Why did my doctor compare getting shots to getting your oil changed
2019 2018-07-26 19:38:04 I'm looking for, but cannot find, an actual line where any Iranian official threatened safe passage of oil through Hormuz/Gulf in last month. Can someone point to an actual quote or is this all just a big assumption?

2021 2018-07-26 19:37:55 not to go the fuck off again but i am so happy to be moved bc the oil industry ? I Despise It
2022 2018-07-26 19:37:27 this is my problem with oil and gas; pollution sucks and I hate it but the machinery at refineries is just //so cool//
2023 2018-07-26 19:37:26 Yay for “green” energy that needs oil to run its parts. Wind energy is a joke
2024 2018-07-26 19:37:24 Am no expertise on this matter but do remember when Hugo Chávez was leaders- country was rising well with socialist led move - the problem was USA don't like when other countries become to independent especially Oil Rich Countries (trading with Russia & China at the time etc)
2025 2018-07-26 19:37:18 It is ppl like you who are the very reason NS and MNS are in jails today.  Cause you guys work is to ignite the fire and pour oil on it!
2026 2018-07-26 19:37:11 Have you tried CBD oil? I find that it works wonders for my sciatica pain.
2027 2018-07-26 19:37:06 That is it.
2028 2018-07-26 19:37:00 many clothes from 2nd hand stores, purchase perishables in bulk on sale, and vacuum-pak/seal them, (they last years), cut your own hair (men)--easy and save tons, do your own auto maintenance, (oil and fluid changes, plugs, electrical, etc...)
2029 2018-07-26 19:36:27 It's vital even oily skin gets moisture because, without it, the skin will overcompensate for the loss of hydration (with more oil), leading to breakouts and an uneven skin texture. Take note: Moisturizing adds water to the skin, not oil.
2030 2018-07-26 19:35:51 Oil change have you acting brand new
2031 2018-07-26 19:35:49 this morning when i was in the hotel in the elevator there were these posters and i was like “wrow those look like midgar in ff7” and it was fuckign. blue and green pictures of out on site on the oil sands to promote a trade show

2033 2018-07-26 19:35:33 Shortages in Venezuela are due mostly to large international companies (75% of the economy is non-government) creating the shortages around election time.

If anything, Venezuela is a case of an economy dependent on oil, and bankrupted by US & corporate meddling.
2034 2018-07-26 19:35:32 This has happened before, even in non-socialist administrations. The difference is that over the years, our dependence on oil has increased. And control of the flow of goods and services isn't exclusive of socialism, any law that regulates them does that.
2035 2018-07-26 19:35:26 You're likely using a foundation with oil in it, which is reacting to the oil on your skin, causing the separation. I suggest using an oil free foundation. Stay away from foundations that say, luminous, glow, hydrating... go with a matte foundation.
2036 2018-07-26 19:35:25 眠れなかったよ・・・
2037 2018-07-26 19:35:09 what are you using bio oil for now...

2042 2018-07-26 19:34:40 2/2 you can sleep in the oil (coconut oil for strength olive oil for hair texture and looks). Never at the same time obvi. If your gonna use the oil I recommend once every 2 weeks. Don’t over do it bc it can make ur scalp too oily. The best bet is using Olaplex no 2 as a mask!

2045 2018-07-26 19:34:19 @jakequery do you think part of the issue with Lucas Oil is that it had to be built to hold a crowd to accommodate a Super Bowl? That will likely remain dead space for the Colts going forward.

2047 2018-07-26 19:33:57 Toni frowned a bit and leaned down to softly kiss the spot she had just mentioned, still massaging her back seriously, working on that one spot in particular before she got some more oil and put some on her lovers thighs. Now massaging those slowly. “How’s that baby?”

2054 2018-07-26 19:33:01 "These giant tubes are partially buried in the permafrost. The gas inside pulls heat out of the ground and in the process, keeps it frozen."

Step 2: deep/leave in conditioner is amazing but don’t over do it. Do a hair mask once-twice a week for 15-20 minutes. 
Step 3: olive and coconut oil is good but not great. If your hair is SUPER DAMAGED 1/2
2057 2018-07-26 19:32:50 Oh, I think they have a lot of snake oil.
2058 2018-07-26 19:32:48 The only "real" thing about that solidified oil chunk is how real nasty it is
2059 2018-07-26 19:32:46 Do they farm oil then?

2064 2018-07-26 19:32:01 First disruptions of oil tankers.
2065 2018-07-26 19:31:58 I’m sure they will hold that position basically forever. Nonetheless, Saudis recognize oil is finite and are tapping their other resources. Of course, it’s still energy, just as G & FB core business is selling access, so a broader analogy would fit.
2066 2018-07-26 19:31:57 Audi's launch of an EV SUV is fantastic news. If we're going to switch from oil we'll need all the car companies to join in. But your point about this killing Tesla sounds very much like early iPhone naysayers when Samsung released their own awesome phones. It's a growing market.

2074 2018-07-26 19:30:43 I do 90 miles everyday, I drive my car to work because I need to carry my tools about. I drive a golf TDI and change the oil every 6 month and check the brake bads

2077 2018-07-26 19:30:19 Like a vampire, he drinks oil out of robots.
2078 2018-07-26 19:30:19 Just like we need an inquiry how a chairman of Energy regulatory during Arap Moi tenure acquired Turkana community land and sold the land to Tullow oil company @edwinsifuna @JunetMohamed @GovernorNanok
2079 2018-07-26 19:30:15 I gave my daughter her first bath in a baking tray and then rubbed her in olive oil... I did think about adding rosemary and garlic.
2080 2018-07-26 19:30:06 Literally every reply is negative. I wonder what it's like to be an ideological snake oil salesman who makes men and women into enemies for attention and profit. I don't hate all women, but one's like this are impossible to like.
2081 2018-07-26 19:29:53 A3. Hard to say. Hasn’t slowed down barca, madrid, psg from buying whoever they want. Solely stops a new oil baron from turning a club into a powerhouse. Keeps out new new money. But its probably kept some smaller clubs from overleveraging themselves and folding
2082 2018-07-26 19:29:53 There are rumors that the pastor is CIA & tried to stir up trouble (coup on Erdogan). Frankly, I wouldn’t doubt it. Both Erdogan & CIA are corrupt. We’d be better off leaving the whole region alone. But the greedy oil/NWO globalists headed up by CIA cant let that happen.
2083 2018-07-26 19:29:52 Brilliant news today. What we've all hoped for, a market listing, making it much more than a pipedream now. Let's hope meinharrd not only stays but has a board place. Need a marketing team to get this promoted and publishers signed. Happy

2126 2018-07-26 19:24:10 Credit insurance products are the modern day version of snake oil, except worse because it's like they sneak of bottle of snake oil in your coat pocket and then charge a hidden monthly fee to the principal of your loan.
2127 2018-07-26 19:24:04 if you substitute oil with mayonnaise in any boxed cake recipe, it makes the cake more moist.

2129 2018-07-26 19:23:48 $40 and $69 actually. Oil in the Permian sells for $55. No one gets the WTI $. There are many variables. Why do we need to always be so political? @PremierScottMoe how long to build a pipeline in Sk? Started that new Husky pipeline yet? Any abandoned wells to deal with?
2130 2018-07-26 19:23:42 Dafuq you using butter for? LOL Greasing the pan? You can use any oil, but olive oil is great tbh... but butter for keto is ALWAYS good. Use butter EVERYWHERE (unless you are concerned about cholesterol)

2147 2018-07-26 19:21:24 Omg so. I’ve been making something similar to this for lunch since you told me about. Cucumber, tomato, onion, olive oil, basil, and rice vinegar. So satisfying.
2148 2018-07-26 19:21:17 I JUST started using oil Matthew I'm such a n00b
2149 2018-07-26 19:21:13 Ladies, if your vag is smelling bad, don't be embarrassed. Mix a spoonful of baking soda in a small bowl of water and soak a cloth in it. Wipe down your kitty with it and apply some coconut oil afterwards. It really helps!! Also, keep that area trimmed not shaved!!!!!!
2150 2018-07-26 19:20:59 I have found what I was looking for in CBD oil. #Winning
2151 2018-07-26 19:20:53 Most are used for oil and soybean meal to feed animals . Given the results with the EU negotiations don' t you think your closing the door on china is a little premature?
2152 2018-07-26 19:20:50 Defence is certainly not a strong suit for this organization, be it in the big leagues or below. Only youngish piece who could be viewed as a plus defender is Grichuk and he's about to turn 27.

2156 2018-07-26 19:20:38 I dry just spent $100 on a oil change & a inspiration 
2157 2018-07-26 19:20:37 Health food store has CBD oil & it'll help the cramps.
2158 2018-07-26 19:20:36 #RockstarGames  There are a lot a land and Air vehicles in GTAV online which I love! But how about putting in a Water base DLC like a Pirate based one?
With a underwater Base?, or an oil rig weapons platform? And bring in more subs and the aircraft carrier? Please!!!
2159 2018-07-26 19:20:11 I agree w/your assessment. I think Erdogan is a thug & opportunist. He worked with ISIS to launder the stolen Syrian oil and yeah, the aborted coup attempt looked totally staged to allow him to crack down. Erdogan is definitely playing both sides (US and Russia) to his advantage.
2160 2018-07-26 19:20:11 His fingernails better not be black with used engine oil/grease in them!
2161 2018-07-26 19:20:09 @lookner Oil tankers can cause huge amount of damage to ocean if damaged or sunk that alone could cause delays or shut down the strips so thank God the ships werent taken out

2168 2018-07-26 19:19:15 been here for forever for an oil change & i was the ONLY person here 
2169 2018-07-26 19:19:15 @OnTheGoCBC I've always wondered why NL doesn't invest in wind power and focuses so much on oil. We certainly have enough wind to go around. Plus, you know, renewable for the win.
2170 2018-07-26 19:19:13 The mascot for Sinclair Oil!!
2171 2018-07-26 19:19:10 My take on city fans is... they got oil money and became relevant, won some titles/cups, got cocky because of it and now think it’s their god given right to win everything and every game, they hate losing and hate being rattled #salty
2172 2018-07-26 19:19:08 'Modern Economy', right.. like fossil fuels like coal and oil that they're pushing instead of solar or wind energy.

2176 2018-07-26 19:18:59 Why the hell do oil changes take so long
2177 2018-07-26 19:18:56 The Prophet Muhammad S.A.W said, " Eat olive oil and massage yourselves with it, for it comes from a blessed tree."
[Narrated by Ahmad and al-Tirmidhi]

Olive oil protects from heart attacks and reduces the cholesterol.

2178 2018-07-26 19:18:56 Ooh, ahh, ain’t that precious
2179 2018-07-26 19:18:53 We apologize for the delay in responding to you. 
The Fuel and IPP charge fluctuates monthly and reflects the movement of the oil prices. Based on the movements of the prices, you should see a different rate on your bill each month.
2180 2018-07-26 19:18:50 My dad has called me 4 times, and has texted me twice in the past week, telling me to get my oil changed (which I really do need to do)  but we live 4 hours apart, how does he know how many miles are on my car????
2181 2018-07-26 19:18:45 Right I oil cleanse before I wash my face and been working wonders
2182 2018-07-26 19:18:42 really? they play for the same aipac/netanyahu/cfr zionist israel war machine, big oil team. #IsraelGate #BakkenGate
2183 2018-07-26 19:18:37 This looks delicious.  Drizzle a little olive oil or balsamic vinegar, or both?  and it looks like a hit!

2185 2018-07-26 19:18:26 Dear God, I love olive oil.
2186 2018-07-26 19:18:23 true.  there was once a massive forests where we extract oil and coal from now in all areas of the planet.  its rather interesting.
2187 2018-07-26 19:18:17 Yep. Selling snake oil, attracting attention by creating train wrecks and networking are 3 things they do well.
2188 2018-07-26 19:18:14 Perhaps Turkey's defiant position on purchasing Iranian oil despite your desire for sanctions should be more important to you, Donald.
2189 2018-07-26 19:18:09 No I don’t believe so. Wooden clamps are quite often from beech. It recommends soaking the wood in oil first to help with threading. We’ll see.

2194 2018-07-26 19:17:21 I don't know if you've ever seen those oil paintings of goat-demons screaming in the 1400s. They're horrific. But they look TAME when compared to a field hockey player roaring "MY ANACONDA DON'T WANT NONE UNLESS YOU GOT BUNS, HON"
2195 2018-07-26 19:17:20 This is ridiculous!! I am in Michigan, however I can’t leave the state, with my meds....the ONLY thing that works for me, because if hubby gets pulled over, and I have it, we go to jail.  Oil is still a sch 1. This madness has to stop.  Move to the mitten and I’ll hook ya up.
2196 2018-07-26 19:17:09 So my mother put oil on my hair yesterday and now my face is breaking out 
2197 2018-07-26 19:16:58 I'm going to start charging people an entry price to get into my house. I'll pop some hot stones in a corner with a wooden bucket and spoon full of water, clear some surfaces and get some oil on the go... it's like a sauna in here, might as well make some money out of it...!

2201 2018-07-26 19:16:21 @FidemTurbare moral relativism is snake oil and now we see the effect. The upsurgence of the far right. Lefties got it wrong.
2202 2018-07-26 19:16:15 You're welcome and hang in there! I'm writing another oil spill follow-up myself.
2203 2018-07-26 19:16:08 Looks properly industrial. I'd highlight some details on the metal door/valve mechanism thing, and some polished metal wear highlights too. Then maybe some specific "oil/grime dripped down here" spots.
2204 2018-07-26 19:16:06 Hey Sophie!  Its cinnamon, turmeric & cumin seeds and a little rapeseed oil to make it into a paste. It was very simple & delicious

Customer: "will it be really oily like how my mum cooks it?"

Without saying it out loud...

"F*** off!"
2207 2018-07-26 19:15:48 A4. Ghee is probably my overall favourite for flavour. Goose or duck fat for roasting parsnips. Cold-pressed olive oil for salad dressings. Avocado for mayonnaise .  #KnowYourFatsChat

2212 2018-07-26 19:15:35 Condemination? Why? Oil is more important than people; they should target civilians then? Houthis are more considerate than the killers in SA.

2225 2018-07-26 19:13:49 Cantwell is still tweeting about gas prices and oil and also biofuels and EVs. (I lost count) I know she has mostly voted ok on bike/ped/transit but this makes it look like she just does not get it but enjoys complete street photo ops.
2226 2018-07-26 19:13:48 Lol I cook with coconut oil so all good here 
2227 2018-07-26 19:13:46 First time getting an oil change alone :(
2228 2018-07-26 19:13:36 Venezuela is great case study far better than any Scandinavian country as they have oil reserves larger than Saudi Arabia and only 32 million people. Bernie used to refer to Venezuela all the time why doesn’t he anymore. This is the logical end in socialism every single time.

2243 2018-07-26 19:11:42 @jakequery How much of the change in atmosphere is the fact that Lucas Oil Stadium, while a football stadium, was also built with multi-uses in mind? (Concerts, soccer now, etc?) RCA hosted concerts but it was built around football.

2246 2018-07-26 19:11:26 Part of the problem is these people know if they scream questions and refuse to leave when asked, sometimes Trump will respond.

“Fuck baby....”
2249 2018-07-26 19:11:10 A5 All of these can be very important.  But for some industries, like oil and gas Canada's reputation is so strong, with respect to environmental responsibility and regulatory, that we see other jurisdictions coming to Canada to learn how to develop their own policy.  #TradeElite

2261 2018-07-26 19:10:38 In the 80's there was an oil spill on Alaska coastline.
News said the area was ruined for hundreds of years.
In 10 years the ocean had cleaned out all the oil ITSELF!
Point is...the Earth can clean itself but we need to encourage the planting of trees and common sense reforms.

2285 2018-07-26 19:07:59 Can God make an oil so essential even he has to use it? 
2286 2018-07-26 19:07:56 Boil the water
Put the rice in, make sure you wash it first
Let that shit cook for 15-20 minutes
Realize you forgot to put any salt or extra virgin olive oil or coconut milk in that bitch
Pour cold marinara sauce on the finished product
Voila, rice
2287 2018-07-26 19:07:54 I'm confident that there is a lot of inbreeding in Florida. Also is crisco cooking oil the official shampoo here?  Yall oily and nasty as fuck.
2288 2018-07-26 19:07:48 But Alaska's budget has been very worrisome since oil prices deflated, so there are people who support the short term infusion of money into the state, hoping that the potential threats won't materialize.
2289 2018-07-26 19:07:11 It’s not oil we’re after haha. Need penetrating oil and grease. Grandpa got it shipped to us. But I can’t find a number anywhere who he called. So I’m trying to find it. Figured someone on here would have it
2290 2018-07-26 19:06:59 Based on what exactly? They gave up nothing more than low grade lottery tickets for a guy who instantly improves their pitching staff. Easy win for the Yankees.
2291 2018-07-26 19:06:40 You will have much to write in your blog. What will I write? -- "the grinder does zOoooooommm brooooom whroooom and paste ready ...oh don't forget to add salt pls, and ..olive oil and paprika and parsley and...ummm um ok done"
2292 2018-07-26 19:06:30 You may have had some shitty luck there my friend. I’ve owned quite a few. Old & new, with very few problems. Even a 2011 S3 that chowed no oil between services , went like the stink.
Almost bought a M3 once.. 
2293 2018-07-26 19:06:27 Someone pick me up from the dealership gettin oil change and wash on my truck , lunch on me .
2294 2018-07-26 19:06:22 Tea tree oil has been good to my skin.
2295 2018-07-26 19:06:20 Ethanol is a boondoggle.  Government subsidies and blending requirements are basically welfare for farmers.  It damages engines and is a net negative on btu input vs output.  As we are awash in domestic shale oil it is silly to support ethanol. (Other than to pander to Iowans.)
2296 2018-07-26 19:06:17 How can people survive that? And Venezuela is oil rich. It was once the most popular Caribbean summer cruising destination. No yachts dare go there now.

2318 2018-07-26 19:03:06 We can do things about it— but cutting off big oil and coal companies won’t help it. It needs to be done by the people and the economy with very little government assistance. Giant government programs designed to stifle free market won’t help.
2319 2018-07-26 19:03:01 Good ole motor oil. Sometimes you gotta lube up the ole gears. Trying to get the ole digestive system working faster maybe help speed up the metabolism.
2320 2018-07-26 19:02:48 I have to declare, I do not know too much about Palm Oil. I hear good things about it but obviously the sustainability side is horrific from what I see. There is however RSPO (Responsibly sourced) right? #KnowYourFatsChat

2331 2018-07-26 19:01:43 So use oil products instead?
2332 2018-07-26 19:01:38 it's a reasonable decision due to the serious threat to the safety of maritime navigation, and the international community must be aware of the environmental disaster that will occur when these terrorist groups succeed in targeting one of oil tanker !!

2350 2018-07-26 18:59:50 Yep, there are 10- alfalfa, potatoes, cotton, corn, soybeans, sugar beets, papayas, squash, apples, and canola. That's it. Most people think there are hundreds. Of those, several (oil and sugar) are know to be bad for you in large amounts.
2351 2018-07-26 18:59:48 I worked in the Oil industry most of my adult life and I have seen that the fishing industry and oil can go hand and hand. I  remember one job in Norway where i saw cod fish so big and so plentiful, we couldn't see the pipeline we were trying to lay. Proper management is key

2356 2018-07-26 18:59:11 It is. Evans been asked to try for another team and I'd hate to leave the Oil Kings. Have to see what they offer I guess.
2357 2018-07-26 18:59:05 I have new tools and instructions from my PT to help with my tendonitis. This results in my literally having a towel and a bottle of baby oil on my desk. I didn't think about how awkward this would be until I saw it.

2363 2018-07-26 18:58:57 It is. My daughter in law did the core testing vs extraction of North Sea seams. Of what they know of, there is oil for AT LEAST another hundred years or so that can now be extracted. B/c of seams, they know there's more - it just hasn't been tested for financial viability yet...

How Come they can trade tea and car parts for oil but not medicine?

2401 2018-07-26 18:55:37 when i increased my daily water intake, is when my skin really became flawless, i still get a little here & there breakout from time to time, but tea tree oil remedies it for me, if you're not gonna drink water don't ask me my regimen, lol.

2405 2018-07-26 18:54:48 Oh no! Kia! I will keep her in my prayers. I really hope the CBD oil helps her!
2406 2018-07-26 18:54:44 It just feels like there's a disconnect between your two tweets. Unemployment so high, recession, etc despite all of the oil money that's come in. More money doesn't mean much if it's constantly mismanaged.
2407 2018-07-26 18:54:41 Got that body wash, cologne and coconut oil moisturizer from Bath and Body Works ya boy smelling like a pretty princess 
2408 2018-07-26 18:54:35 Lastly FOR THE LOVE OF GOD just use conditioners that are formulated for hair. Coconut oil can leave residue that when you go in the sun could give you burns. Pure Coconut oil is for cooking, not conditioning.

2413 2018-07-26 18:54:11 The Tullow Oil impasse should have been solved with a 'Community Benefits Agreement' and not an Memorandum of Understanding that has very little inking on what the community gains from the existence of the oil drilling apart from the revenue sharing btn County and National govt.

2417 2018-07-26 18:53:40 And its clearly not working. Saudi Arabia has been trying since April to make it look like there's a serious threat to the safe passage of oil in the Red Sea. I think they'd like some international pressure on Iran to stop supplying the Houthis to start.
2418 2018-07-26 18:53:35 I'm so confused right now.
2419 2018-07-26 18:53:11 Good plan, but I think they’re all artificial these days. Plenty of aniseed oil on eBay though.
2420 2018-07-26 18:53:04 Not everyone was blessed here in the states with Hydo opportunity, the amount of environmental damage done by creating solar panels in China is frightening, and wind is not really cost effective. We can clean oil based to a great state.

2422 2018-07-26 18:52:56 @CNN the people that actually live in Alaska and live off of the natural resources have every right to extract oil and natural gases from their native lands to be able to have a standard of living and make their mark on the global economic stage! Majority of Alaskans want 2 do it

2425 2018-07-26 18:52:41 What kind of oil producing state would have fuel scarcities more than 4 times in a year? 
And it happens every year... 
They just don't love themselves, yet it's a home commodity...
AKS why?

2426 2018-07-26 18:52:28 As an epilepsy patient, I currently am treated with cannabis oil. After 18 medication failures, this is the only thing that keeps my brain from seizing. As of now, I cannot travel anywhere outside Michigan, for fear of being pulled over, and arrested. It’s time!!!
2427 2018-07-26 18:52:20 Nah... when this car was still under (motor plan) I informed the institution about the car consuming too much oil and they lied to me and told me it was  due to it being turbocharged. And when the plan collapsed they then confirmed that is was due to factory fault. #Audi
2428 2018-07-26 18:52:19 I think half of this money back to the oil companies working in Iraq as they put around 20$ /barrel production cost , as u may know Iraq oil very easy to get it out from the ground not that big deal
2429 2018-07-26 18:52:19 Your tooth brush is celebrating 1 year anniversary but you buy data bundles every week, my children you need 20 litres of anointing oil and 10 years of fasting for deliverance
2430 2018-07-26 18:52:13 It's not about that damn pastor. It's about Iran. It's ALWAYS about Iran, because Trump's foreign policy is being directed by Zionist Jews.

Erdogan yesterday: 'We will continue to buy oil from Iran. Iran is our Strategic partner.'

Trump today: 'We will sanction Turkey to death'

2442 2018-07-26 18:50:15 oil changes really testin my money
2443 2018-07-26 18:50:00 So quick to point the monetary losses; shouldn’t loss of life be belabored with the same vim? Wouldn’t it cost less per day to protect the wananchi? Or only their oil matter? #TurukanaLivesMatter

2450 2018-07-26 18:49:12 He’s not doing too good. He’s trying to recover and fix his house from hurricane Harvey still and he’s looking for a job because he was let go in the oil field :(

2452 2018-07-26 18:49:06 Canada imports 1/3 of their oil from Saudi and other countries that openly murder homosexuals. Murder. When will your article about boycotting Esso/Shell etc going to run? Or are you cool with the hypocrisy? Your choice
2453 2018-07-26 18:48:50 Fun fact when frying, you wanna put 1 or 2tsp of salt (any kind will do) before you fry so that the oil doesn’t jump as much and burn the shit outta you.
2454 2018-07-26 18:48:45 So my crush was showing me how to replace an air filter today and all I was thinking was how much I NEED AN OIL CHANGE AND A GOOD SERVICE DONE FROM HIM 
2455 2018-07-26 18:48:32 Um I'm Italian so I can't answer this question without bias. But in my humble opinion there is never too many olives, unless these been brined in oil, those are nasty.
2456 2018-07-26 18:48:23  fuck me lowie. I’ve seen you hold some shares a lot longer than you should and some were right dogs. Saw you quoting the IPO for your Congolese oil share about the dividend. Good luck with that  You’ve more chance of Big Dave going on a diet than him giving fuck all to PIs

So Jared wants Sam & Dean covered in baby oil half naked o..k.. #lrt
2459 2018-07-26 18:48:07 This dude changing my oil is acting like he has no idea what he is doing and it's stressing me out
2460 2018-07-26 18:48:04 They're really good games. I always beat the boss of the first act in 2 by saving up oil barrels and detonating them all on him, killing him instantly and covering the entire area in flaming oil.

2463 2018-07-26 18:47:53 I keep telling everyone how much CBD oil has helped, actually made my immune system work.  If anyone wants to try it I use "Isolate Direct" brand, & it's always consistent, even though I'm not about taking it like I should.
2464 2018-07-26 18:47:52 I would rather have have my hands covered in dirt,oil, grease then to be asking my mom and dad for money.
2465 2018-07-26 18:47:37 YOU mentioned the private property in socialist countries, not me, So, I answer that in Venezuela there is private property. 
second: it's good idea to turn public banks, posts, oil companies and transports. In Italy, when we had this, we were the 5th economic power in the world.
2466 2018-07-26 18:47:35 Agreed. I've been reading up on Peak Oil, global warming, the jellyfish apocalypse, antibiotic resistance, the Kessler syndrome, etc.... All solvable if we start now. If not we're rolling the dice that engineers and scientists will, once again, save us all. It's a big gamble.
2467 2018-07-26 18:47:31 Kenya has oil Glory to God. However, the oil industry wants all the proceeds without benefiting the local community of Turkana. Now they can't move it. Surely?

2474 2018-07-26 18:46:42 So getting my oil changed, while in the waiting room my sunglasses get stuck in my hair, cut to me trying to subtly get it out as I hit my arm on the wall and everyone looks, to see me trying to get hair filled sunglasses off my head.
2475 2018-07-26 18:46:41 They must get kick backs from the oil/plastic industry
2476 2018-07-26 18:46:40 Matthew, love your work, but you're wrong on this: About four years ago corn traded at roughly 500 cents a bushel; now it's about 360, despite more corn ethanol being produced every year. More corn is farmed on fewer acres than in the past. Oil drives up food prices, not ethanol.
2477 2018-07-26 18:46:37 @DannMwangi a poet who thinks that the discovery of oil was a source of national pride is such a strange phenomenon.

Visit #thebigconservationlie and see that GoK and the British have no intention to share that revenue with the local people. Oil=greed.
2478 2018-07-26 18:46:28 No Longer with Hempworx and wow what a relief. Bad business screwed over anyone outside of the U.S. Still advocating for CBD oil and have found a much better company that I will be promoting. Many other products also, compared to Hempworx limited selection. More info to come!

2482 2018-07-26 18:46:05 So despite a huge influx of oil and gas royalties Labour still bankrupted the country. This is Socialism in action - kids should be taught about this - like a sort of 'Warnings from History' documentary.
2483 2018-07-26 18:46:00 @VinnieTortorich 
So I decided to start taking shots of villa cappelli olive oil as an appetite suppressant.  not only did it work but I discovered it basically cures the heartburn I've had for over 20 years.  Thanks for getting me off Omeprazole dude!

2488 2018-07-26 18:45:09 Absolutely! The cheap and nasty seed oils that came into the spotlight in the 1970's :-( You know, Rapeseed for instance was first developed as an oil to be used as an engineering lubricant on Navy vessels  #KnowYourFatsChat
2489 2018-07-26 18:45:04 wow a Honda budget rich dudes bag them now. I maintain mine on a bicycle budget
2490 2018-07-26 18:44:58 Not just MS/Epilepsy lots of illnesses. I guess there will be no licence given to cultivate the medicinal strains to use the alcohol extraction method to produce the full spectrum oil?
2491 2018-07-26 18:44:55 It's about time, people with serious illness should be given the cannabis oil, people have suffered long enough. As long as it's only prescribed by doctors so it doesn't end up in the wrong hands then it'll be a success.
2492 2018-07-26 18:44:43 Lisa, I know your long and views can be one-sided and you just want the stock to go up and really dont care why! Knowing the oil business as I do, not a guru but do have my connections in Permian ect, this doesnt sell me.  They need oil & major partners, then Im in.
2493 2018-07-26 18:44:31 Can the oil stop rushing players...as good as Evan is being forced to compete with men right away is stupid. Ethan bear is a right shot and should be given a better shot then Evan who should be developed properly so we don't ruin him.

Is reordering Olive Oil worth our safety?
2495 2018-07-26 18:44:17 I've been to the ford dealer in Philly with the van at least 3 times a year since we bought it in 2013.  No mailers ever for discount coupons.  I stopped at a dealer ONCE in Houston to change a flat/spare and oil change, they send a mailer once a season.
2496 2018-07-26 18:44:16 No renewal of oil blocks ooo
2497 2018-07-26 18:44:13 Today has been productive whew. Got the car’s oil changed, hosed off the back porch because my son is a menace who shits on the patio... I’m gonna vacuum and maybe work on art? Maybe? And maybe do some financing for car stuff to see a rough timeline for that
2498 2018-07-26 18:44:13 I hate when I get an oil change and they adjust my seat completely  you in my car for all of 2 minutes just deal with it
2499 2018-07-26 18:43:51 The solution is sustainable sourcing from demand makers. This will in future most likely be assisted with block chain technology, which will be able to 100% verifiy where the oil comes from (ex. is it from an approved farm or was it produced while forests were destroyed)

In 2017 the U.S. contributed more funds to NATO than Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and Canada combined.

We defend allies from Russia as we Run Trade deficits with our allies, as they buy oil and gas from Russia
2504 2018-07-26 18:43:08 Psori-Care II is so effective because emu oil acts like a therapeutic balm by moisturizing the skin and reducing the itching, redness, and scaling associated with many stubborn skin conditions.
2505 2018-07-26 18:43:02 Hitler tried it in Germany until war allowed him to steal most of the resources in Europe & the Russian oil fields & even then the failure of the German war economy was a major factor in Germany's defeat.

2513 2018-07-26 18:42:19 find it amusing when ppl that don't cream or moisturise comment on my face being greasy. i chose to leave my house with castor oil glow, don't impose your ashyness on me
2514 2018-07-26 18:42:17 1) He isn't Obama
2) Snake oil salesmen ALWAYS have clients--the people looking for easy fixes to hard problems
3) The "America" they care about is a made-for-1950s-TV movie that never existed. Trump's a flack for that vision and they're buying.
2515 2018-07-26 18:42:16 QED - thats Labour Governments for you. Always bankrupting the country. Socialism always bankrupts the country it infests. I mean just look at Venezuela, a country Jezza Steptoe admires, rapidly heading towards failed state status yet having the worlds largest Oil reserves.
2516 2018-07-26 18:42:08 SHE NEEDS A VACATION IN VENEZUELA…an oil rich country that’s been reduced to rubble because of SOCIALISM!!!

2527 2018-07-26 18:41:20 The Kenyan media completely lost interest in the Turkana Oil story. No substantive follow up stories on the  black gold. Nothing deeper than recent standoff between transporter and locals. There's something slippery from Turkana to Changamwe. Let's wait for the explosion.
2528 2018-07-26 18:41:19 I just mean a squeaky wheel gets the oil. It’s obvious at this point it will be the industry standard in a few years. Why not get credit for being one of the innovators?
2529 2018-07-26 18:41:15 Just ate curry with Mexican tortillas. But the curry included potato and green pepper and chilli, all of which are from the Americas. And cider vinegar. Chapatis have more oil though.

2533 2018-07-26 18:41:00 I go to Kyma and Atlanta Fish Market for that. Cooking for 1 is just not worth the effort. Well sometimes I go to Bistro Niko when I am craving duck. (Which reminds me I should oil and rub sea salt into my cast iron skillets just to keep them in top form)

2536 2018-07-26 18:40:45 Cannibas oil cures cancer there you go i said . It is against the law to say that but i really dont care people need to know what cures cancer besides chemo therapy and radiotherapy . And you dont need to lose your hair or your taste . Please research if you dont believe me.

2553 2018-07-26 18:39:06 As a culinary child. Watching you put water into oil hurt me lol
2554 2018-07-26 18:38:59 How should the world react when the publishing mouthpiece of the Supreme Leader Khamenei  prints in bold on its front page, “EVACUATE DUBAI, ABU DHABI, RIYADH.  MISSILES EN ROUTE.” Then #Houthis hit a #Saudi #oil tanker. 
Hardliners in the Islamic Republic begging for it. #Iran
2555 2018-07-26 18:38:58 Do you do the serum first and then the oil or vice versa
2556 2018-07-26 18:38:54 so provinces should have the final say on carbon pricing yet not on oil pipelines. You can't have it both ways
2557 2018-07-26 18:38:46 How much gor the castor oil
2558 2018-07-26 18:38:23 I'd go with oil of platelets.  Maybe essence of txa.  A dash of ffp extract might not hurt either.
2559 2018-07-26 18:38:02 Some guy is here to look at the oil in my house except I didn’t know he was going to be here and I’m home alone. There’s only two ways this will pan out. Murder or porn.

2562 2018-07-26 18:37:44 I'll have to check the brand, it wasn't this though. And that's not to discourage anyone. I just had really high hopes. I ordered a good CBD oil today instead of playing around with a new company, it gets pricey those oils.
2563 2018-07-26 18:37:33 Hey! Absolutely - our Coconut Oil has been liquid for days on end now. All the better for drizzling over broccoli and then roasting it  #KnowYourFatsChat
2564 2018-07-26 18:37:18 Someone said something mean and unnecessary about Blue Ivy. I hope hot oil spills on their leg 
2565 2018-07-26 18:37:18 But not republicans in congress. They do what the Koch Bros tell them to, and it’s not clean energy. It’s more coal and oil.

2572 2018-07-26 18:36:35 They do this in Japan. It’s a slightly different kind of mayonnaise, mind - creamier, less oil. But still...
2573 2018-07-26 18:36:07 And there’s a cooking show on at this oil change place. No sign of snickers
2574 2018-07-26 18:36:07 Except for Norway, none of those countries are known for their care for the environment, or the rights and freedoms of their local population.

2585 2018-07-26 18:35:20 .@JuliaDavisNews - but the same West continues to pouring billions of $ into Putin's pockets instead of doing some serious effort to make themselves independent of Russian oil and gas.

2601 2018-07-26 18:32:57 You also have to purify the individual components of the oil.

2632 2018-07-26 18:29:45 India cancelled one million barrels oil from because of USA sanction against Iran thus India could not keep equilibrium between these two political states.
2633 2018-07-26 18:29:41 I'm guessing Cleveland Clinic Steve Nissen MD doesn't support this diet. Nissen is unequivocal in his lack of support for a zero plant oil diet.

2635 2018-07-26 18:29:33 Palm oil is just used to increase margins for manufactured product because it's cheaper, nothing more, nothing less. At the end we have nature destroyed in totality and a lot of profits for big companies exploiting these crops.
2636 2018-07-26 18:29:33 Every time I come to get an oil change, the workers always ask me. “ dam man where’s the chronic” 
2637 2018-07-26 18:29:33 Or the snake oil supplements he sells through his website and promotes (or did promote) on his YouTube channel.

2640 2018-07-26 18:28:52 Pipeline companies don't engage in 10-20 billion $ projects if it is not feasible.  Canadian oil to port commands a higher price than to US.  The EE makes fabulous economic, moral and unifying sense.
2641 2018-07-26 18:28:49 I used to oil paint and do photo journalism, so I have an eye for composition.  I'm also a little bit crazy and obsessive about details, so that's never a bad thing in art.
2642 2018-07-26 18:28:46 I think she scares all Corp politicians, democrats or republicans.  Anything that threatens their entitlements they will oppose.  Imagine if the oil industry stopped getting their welfare checks. Ooo that would be baaaaad

2647 2018-07-26 18:28:20 So I’m oily, I use to use very little lotion. BUT I guess we’re oily cause our body thinks we need moisture. So it over produces oils which is why I get cystic acne my oil glands get clogged. So now I use 3 diff lotions and it’s way better!!
2648 2018-07-26 18:28:17 “Talking slick like it’s oil talking”
2649 2018-07-26 18:28:16 I think this is it's greatest strength, a great transition for those using oil, and good value.

2659 2018-07-26 18:27:04 No. Saudi Arabia is fighting that war for its own purposes. US/UK interest is low. 9 years of oil reserves left in Yemen and they are ranked 29th. UK is 30th.

2682 2018-07-26 18:23:38 I was clearly told that olive oil becomes deadly when heated too high. I share this information with you both because you are valued friends. 
2683 2018-07-26 18:23:37 Blend it up and add a little bit of sugar or sweetener. So you don’t get the burn and take it like a shot shit works wonders Man. If not eat 3 tablespoons of coconut oil (raw) like real oil and do the garlic it’ll help too!

2686 2018-07-26 18:23:23 Use Peanut butter or just oil/butter
2687 2018-07-26 18:23:23 But what do you do with the CO₂ once you have it? *That’s* the hard part. Think of the millions of barrels of oil burned each *day*. That has to be captured and stored somewhere. Capturing is the easy part.
2688 2018-07-26 18:23:22 Going to work w greased up coconut oil hair but idc bc hair is more important today than looking nice at work.
2689 2018-07-26 18:23:20 Allergy kot. Nasib baik boleh diselamatkan lagi huhuhuhu. Opt for other anti acne spot treatment la selain dari benzoyl peroxide. Salicylic acid and tea tree oil should be ok.

2693 2018-07-26 18:23:03 All these fuss is for Turkey to buy oil from Iran?
2694 2018-07-26 18:22:49 I was just talking about this to a climate sceptic, I said "What have 96% of Climate Scientist  got to gain by promoting Global Warming?", reply "Nothing". I then asked "What has the Oil Industry got to lose?" Just think about the billions in equipment invested.
2695 2018-07-26 18:22:47 @VallanceYoon poor Highlands having you in it’s beautiful space. And while we are on the subject of beauty, I note you are no oil painting either.
2696 2018-07-26 18:22:45 I’m so nauseous and my head is throbbing  but I’m glad laundry is done, cleaning is done, oil change and groceries are done all that’s left is to make dinner later

Also a bad fat to eat.

2699 2018-07-26 18:22:21 That is because of the " have them by the balls" issue, can't use coal or oil so they get hooked on Russian gas decommission the other plants, when the alternative is gone Gazprom hikes the price.

2703 2018-07-26 18:21:46 Procrastinated getting my oil changed by cleaning my entire apartment. My apartment is small, but at least I'm gonna feel really productive today. This is a good day off.
2704 2018-07-26 18:21:38 putting coconut oil on your hair/scalp before you bleach it helps a lot!!! a good barrier on your scalp and your hair feels Less Damaged afterwards 
2705 2018-07-26 18:21:34 Don’t put out the anointing oil just yet Joe
2706 2018-07-26 18:21:28 Leave it in the ground. With the oil that has been pumped off of our coast, we as a province should be alot better off.

2713 2018-07-26 18:20:30 Chick-fil-A has exclusively used highly refined (heat processed) peanut oil to cook Chick-fil-A chicken products since the 1960s. To meet the needs of more of our guests, the Waffle Fries and Hash Browns are cooked in canola oil.
2714 2018-07-26 18:20:16 I just accidentally bit into a fish oil pill thinking it was my gummy vitamin and lemme TELL YA it was like a mini explosion of hell in my mouth

2716 2018-07-26 18:20:10 RT @pharmaclinix_uk: Showers and baths add moisture to your skin, but they can also dry it out by removing the skin's natural oils. Hot water washes away oil faster than warm water. So use warm water when you cleanse your face.
2717 2018-07-26 18:20:04 If China and Iran can hurt , they can greatly take control of the oil monopoly, hurting the US. This is why the CIA pushing for war in Iran and pushing tariffs with China. Also port of Aden is key to moving opioids from Afghanistan to the European markets.
2718 2018-07-26 18:20:01 Cheers to that. David's response to you was ridiculous. I would love to see an independent report into the tangible benefits of our oil and gas sector outside of the sunshine list.
2719 2018-07-26 18:20:00 LOL.

What happened in Venezuela was not just nationalizing the energy sector, but making practically their ENTIRE NATIONAL ECONOMY dependent upon oil exports. Price of oil tanked, and so did Venezuela's economy.

They were literally a victim of international capitalism.
2720 2018-07-26 18:19:59 i know i’m growing up when i get excited that i finally got my oil changed in my car.. ugh
2721 2018-07-26 18:19:48 Should have expropriated the oil, MPLA should b critiqued for that, still the revolutionary force
2722 2018-07-26 18:19:43 Poor is a state achieved by people who purchase her snake oil.
2723 2018-07-26 18:19:40 You are so daft and so uninformed, the Kastina refinery crude oil stock will be drawn from Niger republic thru a purposely built pipeline

2725 2018-07-26 18:19:32 @CorbLund will you ever schedule a concert in Lawton Oklahoma?  There are a lot of fans in the oil fields and farms who can't or won't travel to OKC or Tulsa.  Plus Ft. Sill.  We'd love to see you in SWOK.

2727 2018-07-26 18:19:15 5 BAD HABITS THAT WILL DESTROY YOUR CAR'S ENGINE.
-Frequent redlining,
-Not changing engine oil regularly
-Driving in deep water without snorkel
-Revving the engine without warming up
-Wrong fuel usage.
The above habits cause excessive wear and tear hence reduced engine life.

2729 2018-07-26 18:19:03 And that's critical, since 95% of the Kinder-Morgan bitumen has to go to the US for refining. No refineries in the Far East can currently handle Alberta oil/tar sands bitumen. #cdnpoli

2735 2018-07-26 18:18:20 Finally, a president not afraid to act.  Prior to Trump, all presidents ever did, Republicans and Democrats, was ask nicely and threaten meekly.  Trump gives the impression that he is crazy and just might sink your ship or halt all your oil shipments -- he is taken seriously.
2736 2018-07-26 18:18:10 There are some essential oils that you can eat but they are diluted down. They have essential oil books that have what you can/cannot eat.
2737 2018-07-26 18:18:08 and McCarthy is a #ClimateChange denier who takes lots of money from big oil. Why do taxpayers subsidize big oil anymore when they seem to have plenty of money to give to politics.

2755 2018-07-26 18:16:28 The more of these oil wells that get developed, the better it will be for those of us trying to survive in this place.
2756 2018-07-26 18:16:26 Is it cannabis oil?
2757 2018-07-26 18:16:25 Part of the reason we're in this situation with Russia is because the oil price dropped. Russia is generally more aggressive when economically weak.
2758 2018-07-26 18:16:21 ove you people but I need THC  & CBD oil to handle you or 1 U way to slow to keep my attention !!!

2768 2018-07-26 18:15:33 There is a worldwide glut of oil & gas that has lead small operators to bankrupcy. 

Get over it & get over fossil fuels
2769 2018-07-26 18:15:30 Wow! Queen of the Idiots is still around, and still pandering and trying to sale the Trump snake  oil.

2772 2018-07-26 18:15:17 Aren't Houthi's defending Yemen. They want Port of Aden out of China's hands (its why the US backing Saudis). This is the silk road. It's a very important economic and strategic position.  is becoming the largest  and coal consumer. They suck at producing & exporting oil.

2774 2018-07-26 18:15:15 Yes, lots of licenses so it can be confusing, but of the 110 only 29 or 30 sell to patients. So is the data from all LPs that are selling currently or only ones you work with at the clinic?

2778 2018-07-26 18:14:20 They are pushing to remove the FDA's ability to police the big pharma companies and allow untested, potentially dangerous drugs on the market (valsartan). The GOP is actively trying to repeal the ADA, the clean air and water acts, sell off public land to oil companies 4/
2779 2018-07-26 18:14:10 The attack of Saudi Oil Tanker on the Red Sea by Houthi Iran Militias is a despicable act aimed at harming Yemen's vital interests & the international navigation.The attack was about to led to an environmental disaster. Houthis disregard the international treaties & conventions.
2780 2018-07-26 18:14:09 The world must recognize the duplicity of #India, it is best friends with #Iran biggest buyer of #iranian oil and biggest ally of #Russia and biggest buyer of Russian arms yet tries to demonize #pakistan for its CPEC project.
2781 2018-07-26 18:14:05 Yeah, this one was a lot easier to manage how you counter them. OP Arslan and his oil buff saved me for this challenge.

2783 2018-07-26 18:13:54 There is just one problem: Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark are NOT "democratic socialist" countries. Ironically enough "paid for everything with oil money" applies perfectly to Norway. They are just not governed by socialists like Venezuela is.

2787 2018-07-26 18:13:35 Kev, hae a good gander at the Norskie website above...really read all the sections... it is really well set out and clear. I had to email O&G UK to ask about the Taxation of Oil byWM. They told me each company has its own deal with the treasury.Hence BP & Shell paying no tax 2015
2788 2018-07-26 18:13:20 Iraqis are rejecting Fatih & SoL - they're rejecting Iran, the US must listen & stop ignoring & empowering Iran's position in Iraq. US goals in Iraq are: 1. Keep the flow of oil going 2. prevent ISIS 2.0 3. curb Iranian influence. 
Baghdad is not onboard w/ #3 & cannot stop #2
2789 2018-07-26 18:13:20 I really want to like writing retreats, but far too many snake oil salesmen run them, and I've seen far too many innocent writers with limited funds taken advantage of with the promise of "WE'LL MAKE YOU A BESTSELLER".

2828 2018-07-26 18:07:04 Your reply confirms it was the new president. You say it was strong under obama, but the economy is stronger and growing under trump. So his policies have contributed to their ability to increase their productivity. Didn’t the current congress legalize selling oil to Europe?

2863 2018-07-26 18:01:43 The reason why your face is oily might be because your face feels dry and it’s trying to produce oil but it doesn’t need it that much. So it’s over producing .
2864 2018-07-26 18:01:42 Yes, but your nation must either be a major oil producer or have native marsupials. @thinkdefence

2869 2018-07-26 18:00:56 Okay be careful with the face masks. Not all of them are good for you. Don’t stop exfoliating. You might need Glycolic also. It’ll slow down the oil on your face. But it might dry the rest of the spots. If you keep your face hydrated you’ll be good.
2870 2018-07-26 18:00:42 They do, except for a few items where the suppliers are performing economic warfare, for no reason but to protest the government. How dare they expect their natural resources (oil) to benefit the people of the country! Do they think they're Norway??

2881 2018-07-26 17:59:42 TEA TREE OIL EVERYTHING! ok maybe not like tht but I use it on my face n parts of my body. it's a natural antiseptic. don't apply it directly tho! you have to dissolve it in a carrier oil. I use coconut oil, but it makes some ppl break out so find what works for you.
2882 2018-07-26 17:59:36 That’s not a real degree, bub. Don’t you know the news is fake? Get a real degree, like in changing oil.

2886 2018-07-26 17:59:25 My point about pollution is that going to cleaner energy sources reduces pollution and may effect climate. Oil is not booming because of Trump. It was strong under Obama. The economy effects oil production. Again, if coal is viable why isn't it moving in step with oil?

Why do people always assume “deniers” want pollution? We have a responsibility to take care of the “garden”. Why did you change the subject?
2927 2018-07-26 17:55:39 America should stop exporting oil products.

2950 2018-07-26 17:52:39 Don’t forget,Scott and DeSantos are avid Trumpers.Medicaid denied for working Floridians,cutting healthcare funds in general but for(him)rich tax breaks.Both are for out of control spending but also anti EPA and consumer protections while fraudulent oil lobbyists gain at Nat.

2951 2018-07-26 17:52:32 It’s okay.. my stepmom made me get my oil changed in my car alone yesterday and I wanted to cry 
2952 2018-07-26 17:52:30 Working on my friend's BMW yesterday I think "man this car would be a nice drive just replace a couple of things, fluids, oil, suspension pieces here and there" and he's selling it too lmao  my thoughts with every car I want!

Removed workers rights by campaigning against & smashing unions
Believe we don't deserve healthcare or retirement
Create new laws to imprison folks for profit
Drill for oil in national parks
Allow consumers to be preyed on by corps., shady lenders & invest. firms
2955 2018-07-26 17:52:09 Niggas that sell body oil at train stations may be worse then the niggas who sold CD/DVDs back in the day .

2959 2018-07-26 17:51:50 Then why is oil booming? Coal is dirty,inefficient to get out of the ground and natural gas killed it. You deny 97% of the world's scientists? Even if you don't believe in climate change do you believe carbon based energy pollutes? What is the harm in reducing pollution?
2960 2018-07-26 17:51:41 I definitely got to get a better one, i still got some old oil from the last time.
2961 2018-07-26 17:51:30 My ass can't adult. I went to go get a oil change and when the guy said "how can I help you?" I panicked and said "oil me up sir" lmao I can't go back anymore

2966 2018-07-26 17:50:57 This proves that, not only are humans the ultimate predatorily species but the 'developed countries' are the super-predators. I have removed beef from my diet and will not eat snacks friend in palm oil... but coffee? Why Dear Lord?
2967 2018-07-26 17:50:37 I need to go get my oil changed
2968 2018-07-26 17:50:36 I’m happy with the oil & plaste atm, I’ve heard that cbd flowers don’t taste so great.
2969 2018-07-26 17:50:32 More of your oil,Lord. I wanna burn the light,let me burn this light.
2970 2018-07-26 17:50:30 The rich will (mostly) stay rich. See how oil companies are now taking an interest in charging stations. They just would rather not have the cost of adapting unless its completely necessary.

2975 2018-07-26 17:50:04 dude one oil derrick is not the same as ~130 (real number) wells within 2.5 miles of my house. If you can show me a spot in the country where someone is exposed to that, I'm all ears. To my knowledge nothing like this exists.
2976 2018-07-26 17:50:02 You age well. Fish oil?
2977 2018-07-26 17:49:53 I use vegetable oil, it’s really good for deep-frying too, it’s really cheap and doesn’t add a grubby flavour. :)

2979 2018-07-26 17:49:30 Appreciation for a well done work is due. Doesn't know the meaning of appropriation - comes along to preach a gospel of hatred and sells snake oil conversion. Tch Tch!!

Is that how your rapist Padres taught you to fib and deflect??
2980 2018-07-26 17:49:29 Oh, I meant AFTER she was selling the snake oil. The last years of her life when she was befriending drag queens and renouncing a lot of what she used to say. She was fun then.
2981 2018-07-26 17:49:25 I have not seen the members of the E.U. stopping the demand for Russian oil or natural gas over the  annexation of Crimea. So why should we be at the center of something the rest seem to care little about. We have given Ukraine offensive/Def. weapons something Obama never did.

2986 2018-07-26 17:48:59 South Sudan once engaged Lundin & Africa Oil,partners of Tullow to drill for oil. They ended up hiring govt backed merceneries to forcefully evict residents from the areas they were given drilling concessions. Lundin Oil risked being charged with serious human rights violations.
2987 2018-07-26 17:48:54 What are you blathering about. 100's of millions live in dire poverty now, with coal, oil and gas companies going hell for leather to resist any change. Meanwhile solar PV and small batteries are bringing power to parts of Africa/India that have never had electricity
2988 2018-07-26 17:48:49 I came to get an oil change and the guy is trying so hard to concentrate on my face only and not my crop top hahaha I appreciate it dude
2989 2018-07-26 17:48:47 This is 2018.. everything should be opened 24/7... need a oil change at 3am? Done.. need a can of paint at 2am.. fucking done
2990 2018-07-26 17:48:46 We get no oil from them, why is it changing.
2991 2018-07-26 17:48:44 Dth nt
2992 2018-07-26 17:48:38 I was trying to remember the last time I saw vegetable oil. Do they have it in Poland? Everything is rapeseed and sunflower. This can't be for health reasons, this is a nation that eat lard sandwiches! 
2993 2018-07-26 17:48:34 Also something that gets skipped a lot is maintenance. Clean it once in awhile if it's been shot since it was last cleaned. If it's been stored somewhere for a while put some oil in it.

2997 2018-07-26 17:48:08 coconut oil on face at night?
Keep your skin hydrating and while you sleep by applying coconut oil gently on your face. If you're prone to acne or have very oily skin, try adding a few drops to your normal moisturizer instead to amp up hydration without adding too much extra oi
2998 2018-07-26 17:47:58 Where are the new sanctions against the Russian oligarchs? When will affect world oil prices? Contract with the Saudis will be?

3003 2018-07-26 17:47:05 Extra Virgin is a higher quality olive oil with more flavour/aroma. If you heat it the flavour and aroma is lost and it tastes bitter. Just use the normal olive oil, it’s cheaper and better for frying, it’ll taste better. :)
3004 2018-07-26 17:46:51 get some black seed oil bruh
3005 2018-07-26 17:46:48 either i’ma grow a beard or i ain’t i’m not buying no oil to put on my face
3006 2018-07-26 17:46:45 Take my car in for an oil change and end up needing a new wheel bearing and new brakes why is my car a piece of junk?
3007 2018-07-26 17:46:45 The car place put a sticker on my car telling me to come back in 3,000 miles, but I just went 8,000 miles without an oil change sooooooo
3008 2018-07-26 17:46:43 Bibi wants DJT to join in war with Iran. Trump and Putin are trading Iran for Syria plus Crimea and Eastern Ukraine.  Bolton needs to be compensated for surrendering his balls on Russia.  Bolton and Trump have had it up for Iran since forever.  Maybe this supports oil prices.
3009 2018-07-26 17:46:43 My car blew up when I didn’t change my oil!!

3021 2018-07-26 17:45:41 $CNX at 4 times earnings could be a steal as oil prices continue to climb. Earnings report on August 2nd could be a catalyst.

They gripped that we didn't need Oil, green house gases, so then they should be happy the price is going up. Farmers are bad for environment...they should be celebrating Trump.  Just don't get the hypocrisy.

3032 2018-07-26 17:44:13 They also purchase oil from Iran.   Tighten things up so they pay for their actions
3033 2018-07-26 17:43:52 Alaskans own 77,300 shares of SAVANNA ENERGY SERVICES CORP, worth $111,286. It's from the OIL SERVICES sector, based in CANADA.

3037 2018-07-26 17:43:25 @conocophillips earnings call highlights better oil profitability of Eagle Ford Shale over Permian (Delaware Basin). No transportation constraints getting oil to lucrative Gulf Coast markets, notably.
3038 2018-07-26 17:43:24 Fridges, air conditioners etc. are all heat pumps. HP are much lower carbon than oil/ gas, but are truly sustainable when powered by renewable elec. HP can be set to cool or heat, but radiators won’t work so well if they start dripping!! So it needs to be designed for cooling.
3039 2018-07-26 17:43:18 Goodluck
3040 2018-07-26 17:43:12 There are very localized occurrences of this, such as in Texas oil towns where the oil company wages are so high everyone wants to work there, but obviously other jobs need to be done, so even fast food chains offer upwards of 15$/hour starting wage.
3041 2018-07-26 17:43:11 Venezuela is not suffering because of capitalism. Venezuela is suffering because Chavez nationalized the country’s oil companies and kicked out foreign companies like Shell and Mobil. That IS SOCIALISM.

3065 2018-07-26 17:39:41 And I'm thinking about those news stories where chefs power their biodiesel card using French fry oil. This is kind of genius.
3066 2018-07-26 17:39:38 Don't be like that. I was asking an honest question. People here are getting pretty tired of pronouncements about oil and gas yet being taxed and levied to death at the same time. All I am saying is when these projects have real impact on us then I'll applaud
3067 2018-07-26 17:39:37 Barnett formula?

3072 2018-07-26 17:39:21 Hi David - as strange as it may sound, ConocoPhillips has no relationship with Conoco service stations. The Conoco brand belongs to Phillips 66, so you probably want to reach out to them. We only produce oil and natural gas.

3077 2018-07-26 17:38:41 Kalo mau di cut aja jadi 212 tapi gausah pake air hangat bilasnya. Pake oil cleanser lalu setelah itu pake toner yg hydrating
3078 2018-07-26 17:38:41 I'm glad theyre finally providing those in need with canabis oil as a medical prescription
3079 2018-07-26 17:38:39 “That thing takes two stroke motor oil like a ###**** dirtbike”  if you don’t know the rest of that joke..Go listen to @MurderSmall podcast 
3080 2018-07-26 17:38:25 Majority of my oils are Plant Therapy, but I also have Eden's Garden and some locally obtained oils. However, be wary of some local brands as I have gotten some oils that are stale/rancid, diluted or tampered with mineral oil, despite describing them as pure. Bad business.
3081 2018-07-26 17:38:18 This is a hilariously bad take. The US military is the world’s largest user of oil. Buying local/organic is a privilege afforded to those who can afford it. Lifestyle environmentalism is just a way for granola crunching liberals to feel better about killing the planet.
3082 2018-07-26 17:38:08 Great road win today for @IndyEleven as a late goal lifts them past the Bethlehem Steel 1-0. The Boys in Blue are back in action at Lucas Oil Stadium August 15th  #ComeOnYouBoysInBlue

Pouring oil on troubled waters since 1987.

3085 2018-07-26 17:37:40 Keep up the good work 
May your oil never cease to flow
Flourish with the help of God and achieve more and more.

3087 2018-07-26 17:37:22 Our gov't is warned of more hot summers. Offshore/onshore wind turbines produce more energy than coal and oil combined ' not to mention solar panels, @unitedutilities warn of hosepipe bans in Lancs, yet @CuadrillaUK get the go-ahead to #frack inspite of council saying NO!  Crazy.
3088 2018-07-26 17:37:17 Yeah, I'm a libertarian, I'm not a big fan of authoritarianism in any form. To be honest I always found what little I have seen of Infowars to be quite anti-authoritarian in nature too + a lot of snake oil and super male vitality memes.
3089 2018-07-26 17:37:12 Yes. It's high carb, high sugar, high vegetable oil diets that cause fatty liver. Need to reduce carbs (<25g/day) and remove sugar and vegetable oils (plus margarine) from your diet.
3090 2018-07-26 17:37:07 Working everyday. Drawing without thinking or contemplating, painting through the night, and doing my art history summer work. I’ll post pictures of the work very soon, itching to do a huge watercolor/oil painting @kuzminart
3091 2018-07-26 17:37:02 @foundmyfitness I keep seeing this study administered by Cochrane saying that fish oil is essentially snake oil. Can or should I trust the company that ran the study?
3092 2018-07-26 17:36:57 Off track a bit, What a result to all people that is ill. Medicinal weed legal/oil. RESULT!!
3093 2018-07-26 17:36:52 I'll never step foot in your hotels again. Goop is snake oil crap!
3094 2018-07-26 17:36:44 Hi, yes, I brought my car in for an oil change today I am an adult
3095 2018-07-26 17:36:43 Shame in the center. Same way HPCL was made to take over Gujarat state-owned oil corporation, that was pointed out by even CAG
3096 2018-07-26 17:36:37 So happy that #CannabisforMS has been legalised. I’m currently spending £40 a month on cannabis oil ( no THC) & it helps with leg spasms & sleep - but oil with THC will help much more!
3097 2018-07-26 17:36:27 true adulting is going to get an oil change by yourself
3098 2018-07-26 17:36:21 I’m not even sure how some foreign people get their clothes. I just saw a guy wearing white ESPN pants and a Gulf Oil brand jacket.
3099 2018-07-26 17:36:08 You want to ban something I enjoy because Asians enjoy throwing plastic waste in the ocean. 1. Banning it for me will do nothing to their behavior. 2. Cracking towers produce X% of plastic no matter what. So much of gas, kero, diesel, lube oil, plastic...

3101 2018-07-26 17:35:51 She's a quack at best. You should be ashamed of the snake oil you sell. What an age of disinformation we live in ffs.
3102 2018-07-26 17:35:47 @benshapiro Try making Fajitas with you kids, let them choose the veggies that are cooked first, with Coconut oil + 1 Tbs H20,  and then when done add the eggs, cover, until they are the way you love them! turn fire off, add grated ORGANIC cheese on top & cover till melted...
3103 2018-07-26 17:35:46 I appreciate the suggestion, I've tried a CBD oil that is strong and not found much benefit sadly.
3104 2018-07-26 17:35:41 Beautiful, heavy rain falling in Lower #corkharbour with nice traces of oil on the roads from the build up of road dirt during the hopefully now finished, dry spell.
3105 2018-07-26 17:35:39 @realDonaldTrump Houti's in Yemen have stopped Saudi from shipping product thru its southern port due to attacks on 2 oil tankers today.   Houti's say they attacked warships
3106 2018-07-26 17:35:33 UN aid agencies announced they are suspending all sea operations to #Yemen "due to unforeseen circumstances." Yesterday al #Houthi forces struck a #Saudi oil tanker in the Red Sea and today claimed to hit the #UAE's Abu Dhabi airport. Possible upcoming escalation around #Hudaydah
3107 2018-07-26 17:35:13 If you not trying to offer a man some pussy after he buy you several $16 drinks then offer to do something constructive like detail his car or change his oil. Men don't always want pussy but they know some of y'all chicks are limited.
3108 2018-07-26 17:35:12 Took my car for an oil change today, specifying that I wanted the “regular service” which was the cheapest option. They charged me for the premium service, but I’m too afraid of confrontation to say anything. I’m really bad at this adulting thing. 
3109 2018-07-26 17:35:01 According to the notebook
3110 2018-07-26 17:34:48 It looks like we are in a new, but lower up channel
3111 2018-07-26 17:34:44 U make me laugh. In 2013 u said as a senator dat d 80% oil blocs owned by the north shd revoked. U showed evidence. Has anything changed?
3112 2018-07-26 17:34:18 I was burning off the vented natural gas from my oil well and the adjacent preschool caught fire and everyone died. How much do I need to pay you to defend me on Twitter?
3113 2018-07-26 17:33:50 In case anyone was wondering, CBD oil makes you have some fucked up dreams...
3114 2018-07-26 17:33:47 Voter votes in manor only concerned for own personal interests. Disappointed to find snake oil salesmen isn’t actually working for his interests and isn’t remotely qualified. 
Won’t the rest of the nation care about his plight? Where is the empathy?
3115 2018-07-26 17:33:40 Well said @ARYSabirShakir you put a solid oil dipped slap on Abidi’s face. Scared @WaseemBadami took break.
So far MQM wiped out by Karachiests. And PTI did not use any Muhajir Card.
Bilawal lost to PTI in liyari, Rigged? People of Karachi Trusted IK.
3116 2018-07-26 17:33:25 We did just fine before this pipeline and we will do just fine without it.

You are confusing what oil companies "want" with what Canadians "need"
3117 2018-07-26 17:33:22 I hate coconut oil
3118 2018-07-26 17:33:14 Eish mine are on the cheek. It’s only i week I have been using the tissue oil so I thought I’ll give it until a month to certainly see what happens
3119 2018-07-26 17:33:11 Its all frustration of US as it is not any more Boss around the world. Its sanctions carries no worth. For example it put sanctions on Iran but China has started importing more oil from Iran than ever before. Same example is with Turkey.

3120 2018-07-26 17:32:52 Fuck that I want thousands of different exotic options in the shower....I just discovered argan oil I think? I dunno! So fire
3121 2018-07-26 17:32:50 In Canada we enjoy a National Health Plan. Everyone enjoys it. To those who protest the sale of resources; oil, NG, coal, etc; say good bye to Health Care.
3122 2018-07-26 17:32:42 Making the entire nation dependent on the sale of oil is also a lesson in diversification.
3123 2018-07-26 17:32:24 Olive oil takes it right out
3124 2018-07-26 17:32:09 After ball game, isang matinding masahihan nanaman to ng efficascent oil. Hahaha. 
3125 2018-07-26 17:31:57 We are hot, hot, hot up in the Weald.  You know Mrs Heid there will be a click of the heels one day and we will have another song to sing.  Bear necessities ....... xx
3126 2018-07-26 17:31:52 nobody hits on teenage girls like those oil changer dudes
3127 2018-07-26 17:31:51 What’s up with this disease you claim the Infinite Lens bioengineered? Why do the Inksplots think you have a cure? What do we the people need to know about the cabal of assassins after your crew? Most importantly... what’s Cog’s favorite brand of droid oil and why?
3128 2018-07-26 17:31:48 Forever coming home from work smelling like I bathed in PastTense oil b/c stress
3129 2018-07-26 17:31:37 Pepermint oil helps my back pain
3130 2018-07-26 17:31:25 Some pretty fuzzy logic indeed. How about "OPEC produced what they could while debt financed money losing drillers in the US made swiss cheese out of Texas, crashed the market with Light oil no one wants and now OPEC has to save the day while US drilling continues unchecked"
3131 2018-07-26 17:31:21 That said, Chucke Cheese has some sort of crust that isn't cardboard I think somewhere under the gallon of raw fryer oil on top...
3132 2018-07-26 17:31:18 Shame to you. You lack integrity and you are a disgrace to Akwa Ibom people. Has d oil blocs imbalance u alleged in 2013 being corrected?

3137 2018-07-26 17:30:49 Turkey’s ports are also part of the Qatar oil pipeline deal, which Russia and Iran want badly (re Benghazi). If US cuts off Turkish ports, game over.

3158 2018-07-26 17:28:53 Story of my life: I got an oil change this morning, and after they finished...I realized I left my card at home.

3183 2018-07-26 17:26:44 Oh I'm damn sure I wasn't limited. My mother is a biologist and taught at University I have a sister who is a biologist who is currently teaching at University and I have a sister who is an engineer who works on all kinds of major things from nuclear subs oil rigs and theme parks
3184 2018-07-26 17:26:39 If pick up trucks and vehicles are worth more than the lives of Colten Boushie and Jon Styres.  Does that mean our land and defending it against Oil Pipelines invading our homelands is worth more than the life of Oil Workers and Canadian politicians who approve it?

3187 2018-07-26 17:26:25 The agreements are primarily with tar sands suppliers, and a few oil majors. Your argument is bunk.

P.S. You do realize you’re arguing that the fundamental evidence #KinderMorgan used to justify their pipeline, and that the NEB accepted, is a lie?

3199 2018-07-26 17:25:02 You can add the pharmaceutical, vegetable oil and processed food industries to that equation. Loads of money there and loads of incentive to perpetuate old science that favours carbs and cheap veg-oil based fats high in omega six over healthier MUFA/SFA based alternatives.

3207 2018-07-26 17:24:33 - do your skincare routine ( you don’t have to use a lot of products; less is more )
-  put 4 drops of essential oil on your skin to to be glowin’
- use an unused toothbrush to brush out your eyebrows & put some vaseline on them to be poppin’
3208 2018-07-26 17:24:06 I can’t help but believe that Trump would use war as a pretense to go after their oil.
3209 2018-07-26 17:24:00 Imagine if it's Trump who saves Canadians from this terrible deal with Kinder Morgan in which we're about to pay 8x what this leaky, 65 year-old pipeline is worth - all to keep Alberta's oil lobbyists (who keep most of their $ in offshore tax havens) from having a temper tantrum.
3210 2018-07-26 17:23:59 Flour and oil in a skillet. Stir until it browns to the color you want. Add water to match the consistency you want. Bam! You're done!
3211 2018-07-26 17:23:41 4 years ago this week I hosted a successful & tasty tiki-bar pop-up and then the next night gave one of my favourite famous musicians a naked oil massage while we discussed geopolitics. 

I suppose it’s ok if I have boring days now and again.

3219 2018-07-26 17:23:09 Keep oil away from your eyes... so be careful what you use to take off your makeup.

3231 2018-07-26 17:20:55 You must be a very uneducated on the subject to consider Iran as Russian proxy lol
During that time Russia sanctioned Irans oil exports and Sanctioned Irans military. Iran has a multinational army in Syria which Russia could have dream about It. Russia forces to work with Iran
3232 2018-07-26 17:20:45 To protest his YouTube ban, @RealAlexJones is going to cover himself in vegetable oil and self immolate on a Kingsford grill.
3233 2018-07-26 17:20:43 @KartikDayanand agreed with you but pouring oil on hair is correct ? Does it not hurt eyes if accidentally happens to enter ?
3234 2018-07-26 17:20:39 I've actually had a sip of that and I'm pretty sure motor oil would have tasted better.
3235 2018-07-26 17:20:35 Last year they said peak oil was coming in 2035. I wonder what changed?
3236 2018-07-26 17:20:30 Coconut oil thank you for being so good to me

3243 2018-07-26 17:19:32 According to the analysis of more than 4,300 spill simulations, a rupture to both Straits pipelines could release up to 58,000 barrels of crude #oil into the…
3244 2018-07-26 17:19:32 You’ll see a new feature in the Church this weekend—an ambry! The ambry is where the holy oils are displayed and kept for Sacramental use. You’ll see the Oil of the Sick, Oil of Catechumens and Chrism.

3247 2018-07-26 17:19:24 OK understood.  But we as citizens make decisions to fund all sorts of things “for the public good”. That’s not theft or redistribution of wealth...it’s the priorities we set. 
Tax breaks to oil companies, funding scientific research, buying medicine for poor people etc

3249 2018-07-26 17:19:16 Just ate a food truck sandwich which was basically a caprese salad sandwich: fresh mozzarella, tomato jam, basil, garlic olive oil, balsamic glaze, on French bread. It was so fucking good. I could live off that mozzarella.
3250 2018-07-26 17:19:15 Trump is a snake oil demagogue he’s not a great businessman, he’s not a great negotiator, he’s not a great dealmaker, quite the contrary he’s a dealbreaker! Donald Trump is a pretender, a Conman & he makes sales & cheats his buyers!
3251 2018-07-26 17:19:12 excuse me....

that would be naked oil wrestling.
3252 2018-07-26 17:19:10 @ananavarro  People should also be looking out for the ecosystem in Alaska and the Trump family getting rich on mining  there is always something shady on anything he does Look at Atlantic City. He wants to be in the oil Business his daughter in the golf manufacturing
3253 2018-07-26 17:19:08 Really pleased that all the good work done in KP will not only be consolidated now but the projects that were on a stand still thanks to Federal Govt like oil & Gas exploration. They too will now go ahead full speed InshaAllah.

3261 2018-07-26 17:18:35 Ceci dit avec le peak oil conventionnel passé le 2006, il est plutôt raisonnable de penser que le pétrole va redevenir cher... pour rappel, non renouvelable c est entre 10 et 100 millions d’années pour celui ci.
3262 2018-07-26 17:18:19 Pls Senator Ita Enang has anything changed in the 80% oil blocs u said d north is holding. U wailed for ur stomach. U r a shameless fellow

3265 2018-07-26 17:17:32 @UniversalORL our server in Mythos at Islands of Adventure is awesome! His name is Douglas and my wife has an allergy to shrimp. He took the time to not only explain how the shrimp is fried in the same oil as the other fried food, he went over everything that she could eat.
3266 2018-07-26 17:17:18 Every time I have to give blood  the nurses or labtechs always comment on how great my veins are and I can always hear them going to tell their friends. Today the lady told my veins were like an oil well ready for digging  .
3267 2018-07-26 17:17:18 In case you forgot, oil and gas pay the bills in Houston. Texas and Houston wouldn’t be where they are today without oil and gas. Think about that as you drive your car and use computers made with petroleum products.

3273 2018-07-26 17:16:46 True on the commercial side mostly due to legal ramifications -- at least two TRL 9 systems on the defense side. Lots of money will be pouring in on both fronts -- and hopefully the snake oil will be exposed.

3275 2018-07-26 17:16:36 I don't know why there hasn't been a comprehensive story/doc done on Turkey.. We know they are harboring terrorist cells to unleash on Europe/middle east/America .. We also know they purchased oil from ISIS etc .. @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @IsraeliPM @SecPompeo @AmbJohnBolton
3276 2018-07-26 17:16:28 Expecting anything less than a Zanu victory, is by all accounts misguided. They oil the election machinery and guard it jealously.
3277 2018-07-26 17:16:19 "What I'm asking now is dat oil blocs in d whole country shd be revoked and redistributed according to Federal Character Principle." 2013.
3278 2018-07-26 17:16:10 Confirmation bias. If you are ever certain about an alternative reality that never occurred, then you’re just a cheap snake oil salesman.
3279 2018-07-26 17:15:56 just put a lil bit of coconut oil between them babies! the key is not to rub it in with your hands though- allow your thighs to rub it in while you walk. oiled inner thighs gliding past each other feels like silk on silk.

3290 2018-07-26 17:14:38 The foolish virgins who are waiting for the Bridegroom will run out of oil around midnight and won’t be ready. It’s wise to seek understanding in the Word.
3291 2018-07-26 17:14:35 You know how many SYNTHETIC oil changes I can get for my Chevy for $800? 13 and I’ll have money left over!!!!
3292 2018-07-26 17:14:30 I read all the time. It is oil that y'all are trying to regulate and it is a minor pollutant compare to forest fires and volcanoes. Total world yearly oil  production is 1.5 trillion  gallons. A cubic mile is 1.1 trillion gallons. Fuel cells will be on the market in a few years.
3293 2018-07-26 17:14:27 Aah! Is melaleuca the same as tea tree oil? For how long has she had them? And are they around her ankles too? And when you say it's working for her, has she stopped itching and are the bite marks going away? Sorry for this barrage of questions...
3294 2018-07-26 17:14:18 Bout to relapse on that oil it been a good 2weeks 
3295 2018-07-26 17:14:13 I took my brand new (at the time) Jeep there to get its first oil change. At 3K miles. They tried to convince me the air filter was already bad, tires needed rotated. I haven’t been back since.
3296 2018-07-26 17:13:55 For once your rite Tom. Put the people first by supporting big oil and gas. Lots and lots of high paying jobs #yourgonnaloosetommy
3297 2018-07-26 17:13:51 Oh spare me! Like you care. You tried to "liberalize" Mexican oil and your husband is largely responsible for NAFTA, the latter of which put Mexican families in these kinds of positions!
3298 2018-07-26 17:13:48 Achieving deep decarbonization will never be accomplished if Big Oil is provided the political space of weak market mechanisms that allow them to keep extracting crude from the endangered wild places our children are entrusting us to protect. #keepitintheground

It will go in to eyes in fraction of secs before thet get alert

3312 2018-07-26 17:11:32 100%. Alberta can still sell and extract while building the new energy economy because when the world moves away from oil it won't be gradual and we don't want to be left behind.

3324 2018-07-26 17:10:01 It’s a complex, global economy. I’m sure our Natural Gas is a lot more expensive to import to Germany than to pipeline in it from a closer country. Relying on Russia for too much of their energy supply is dangerous we know-look at the wars we’ve been in to protect our oil supply
3325 2018-07-26 17:09:59 Trump might still do to punish Putin. He has already beefed up sanctions, expelled Russians, had Russian mercenary thugs killed in Syria, sent threats to Putin not to overreach in Syria, armed the Ukrainians, expanded U.S. oil production, increased defense spending

3329 2018-07-26 17:09:33 I have no idea - but I’m beginning to figure, that just to get that petrol pump going, is a huge achievement on your part and Indian Oil’s. Because there is no lack of insensitivity in our fellow Indians, is there?
3330 2018-07-26 17:09:26 The meat, dairy and egg industries have far more money than PETA. In fact they have more money than the oil industry. That's plenty of money to pour into advertisements (aka propaganda) saying that animal flesh and secretions are healthy for you when clearly they're not.
3331 2018-07-26 17:09:19 We worked together and I thought he was kind of ridiculous, but he needed help changing the oil on his car so that plus margaritas and bang we were sleeping together. But also going to jazz bars. Found out he was actually nice became friends
3332 2018-07-26 17:09:08 MY CAR FEELS SO MUCH BETTER!! Lil bby got himself an oil change and his ac vents fixed up and some new brake lights AND I fed him a lil bit cause he was on quarter tank. My total spending for the past two days got bumped up to like $250 cause of the extras but he’s worth it :((

3341 2018-07-26 17:07:59 Every time an engine starts, it takes a second to build oil pressure, so when the car starts and you take off as soon as it starts it can damage it due to lack of lubrication.
3342 2018-07-26 17:07:45 Thanks for the article and comments about Primrose oil. Top 40 I definitely have had arthritis for a few years and Joint issues because of all my sports. I will be making a switch from Fish Oil to try that.
3343 2018-07-26 17:07:40 Exactly, he needs to leave as he's weak & not fit for running the country. Such leaders suck up to the Arabs, because of our dependency on oil, treating em' with velvet gloves, but the fact is we got more pull as they depend more on us. We just need to put more pressure on em'!
3344 2018-07-26 17:07:39 Today there was a rabbit (not the small cute ones) a big ass rabbit in our oil shed. So I did the manly thing, I got someone to deal with it and squealed when it ran (full tilt) at me. But we got it out. What a roller coaster of a day so far.

In the real world the Pacific Northwest still needs crude oil and will get that crude oil by one means or another. If not by the safest means (pipeline) then by less safe ones (train)
3480 2018-07-26 16:52:02 I’m so annoyed men have 45-n-1 bottles for like $4.50. They can wash their hair, face, and body, brush their teeth, unclog the sink, fry some chicken, and change the oil in their car all from the same bottle (:
3481 2018-07-26 16:51:55 Why India is not trading with Venezuela? We have Medicine and food in exchange of crude oil.
3482 2018-07-26 16:51:54 Another excuse to push up the price of oil! Scuzzy OPEC robbers...
3483 2018-07-26 16:51:52 Yes, you enjoy them being upset... At people being murdered... How hard is it to understand how shitty of a person you're being
3484 2018-07-26 16:51:51 Yeah, be another hour or so. If its like this tomorrow, I'll try give my house mate some aversion therapy - see if I can teach her to rub oil in past the tan line. Who knows, if the Americans and Russians attack Faslane, we might end up the only two left on this island.
3485 2018-07-26 16:51:37 Quit driving so fast and you might need new tires. You never know. Have you even checked ran!? ARE YOU CHECKING THE OIL IN THAT CAR RAB!??????
3486 2018-07-26 16:51:20 Small Family Framers need to understand that this government bailout will not help you all the money will be given to big farmers and Trump cronies, Trump is playing you all and you guys are buying his snake oil bull. He is coming to Iowa today to visit a friendly steel company
3487 2018-07-26 16:51:08 Cutest mechanic to ever change my oil.
3488 2018-07-26 16:51:04 no I talk about people being murdered then in a different comment on a different post I said I enjoy how upset that person was
3489 2018-07-26 16:51:01 The abortion ruling occured nine months before the Arab oil embargo/quadrupling of crude oil prices happened October 1973.
The 'Supremes' figuratively 'conceived' a highly destructive economic 'baby' which was birthed nine months later! God's wrath - or just coincidence?
3490 2018-07-26 16:50:56 This report by @IUCN is a great evidence that a boycott of palm oil isn't a sustainable solution. What do you think are the key steps to increase demand for sustainable palm oil?
3491 2018-07-26 16:50:49 Yes. First they bully, shame, or legislate oil companies to invest in alternative energy, then they use the fact that Oil companies do as they are told as proof that alternative energy is desirable.
3492 2018-07-26 16:50:48 I started using a face mask with turmeric and yogurt with a tad bit of Argan oil mixed with my moisturizer and my skin has never looked better. Thank you skin gods

3494 2018-07-26 16:50:34 I got some hemp oil from the health food store and it’s amazing good choice past katey
3495 2018-07-26 16:50:33 Ghee is the in-thing re #keto #banting #lchf anf costs sn arm and a leg. I learnt how to make ghee at home from my mom. Not esoteric. Must start again. Esoteric would be making my own MCT oil! 
3496 2018-07-26 16:50:21 Patination oil on the lead hips? Nice to see.
3497 2018-07-26 16:50:12 bio oil, dermatix
3498 2018-07-26 16:50:12 Googleのにした！なかなかいい感じ
3499 2018-07-26 16:50:10 a lot of it feels like the same crocodile tears i experienced in FL after the BP oil spill. Plenty of Fisherman were happy to give a woe-is-me statement to the press while happily accepting BP's money from the couch.
3500 2018-07-26 16:50:06 Eh, raw cold-process soap (lye, oil, water stuff.)  That stuff sets up HARD.  And scraping it up after you dump a 5# batch all over the kitchen floor is a pain in the ass and requires washing 40 times.  Or so I...hear.
3501 2018-07-26 16:50:06 I have this reoccurring nightmare where I wake up and my home is full of blogger moms and their kids and everything smells like eucalyptus oil.
3502 2018-07-26 16:50:03 Motor oil pussy 
3503 2018-07-26 16:49:56 you gotta dilute THE SHIT out of it. like put tea tree oil in the water diluted.
3504 2018-07-26 16:49:37 The U.S. House passed a "compromise" NDAA 2019 bill to President Trump that will further oil the military-industrial complex, 359-54 (139 Dems voting with the GOP)
3505 2018-07-26 16:49:29 みんなオイルが好きだよね⁇あん⁇嫌い⁇嫌いとか言うならオイル使われてる食品も製品も食べるなよ使うなよwwwwww? ガソリンもオイルだよ⁇www 車も乗るなよwww? 野菜だけ食ってろよwwww ベジタリアンテラワロスwwwwwww
3506 2018-07-26 16:49:25 This is true, although I also do not recommend frying doughnuts in 180 degree oil in this weather!
3507 2018-07-26 16:49:24 The mind is like an artichoke in an olive oil mill
3508 2018-07-26 16:49:24 Yes you are
3509 2018-07-26 16:49:22 Like I called yesterday & made an appointment for an oil change and I get here 10 minutes early and they’re barely calling for the stuff they need for it 
3510 2018-07-26 16:49:21 i got a new face wash, moisturizer, exfoliant, clay mask, oil cleanser, other exfoliant, serum, and eyebrow gel and now i’m breaking out but idk which one it was so imma just let me skin figure herself out
3511 2018-07-26 16:49:10 Gimana cara gue kasih tau lubricant oil yang versi nsfw ya bukan versi otomotif
3512 2018-07-26 16:49:01 ummm no I'm not
3513 2018-07-26 16:49:01 Yess, you got this!! I quit cold turkey 7 months ago, I bought a bunch of those monq essential oil diffusers that look like e cigs. They gave me that feeling of still smoking and honestly helped so much!!
3514 2018-07-26 16:49:00 I swear the second I said out loud that I wanted to get my eyebrows micro-bladed, because one side wasn't growing...it started to grow! Castor oil, y'all.
3515 2018-07-26 16:48:56 Aku tetep pake air hangat&dingin soalnya mau nunggu seminggu dulu nanti setelah itu baru dikurangi, tapi anehnya muka aku gak kering&gak purging. Btw aku oily jadi pakenya mc bukan oil hehe -sender
3516 2018-07-26 16:48:50 エミリーかな？
3517 2018-07-26 16:48:48 Do you take supplements? Some of those mega pills have fish oil
3518 2018-07-26 16:48:39 It’s only some oil tankers now but everything else is fine. Too soon to have a measurable impact and it will likely be resolved (by war or amicably), before any measurable impact on economy
3519 2018-07-26 16:48:34 แหมมมมมมมม กุกงอแงเป็นเด็กแบบนี้ มีรึแทจะไม่ยอมอ่ะ //ถนอมแทหน่อยนะอย่าหักโหมมม  #ตัวป่วนแทแท
3520 2018-07-26 16:48:31 I got oil on my ear from fixing a chain and I'm 90% sure that's peak summer me now
3521 2018-07-26 16:48:29 What did you churn? The vegetable oil?

Hey at least I buy your other product. Natural Bliss.
3522 2018-07-26 16:48:29 my skin still produces oil a lot :(
3523 2018-07-26 16:48:24 So East-West Coastal road that leads to the bulk of Nigeria's oil wealth remains incomplete while the federal government is striking a deal with Niger Republic to build a refinery in Katsina.
3524 2018-07-26 16:48:22 มันไม่หาย ฮือออ
3525 2018-07-26 16:48:07 Your jar of Coconut oil is the true tell of how hot it is
3526 2018-07-26 16:47:43 5555โดนถล่มเฟสว่ามากรุงช่วงเขาออกนอกเมืองกัน 
ฉันแค่อยากขับรถแบบไม่รถติด หรือติดน้อยลงก็ยังดี
3527 2018-07-26 16:47:23 You can make turmeric b ombs w/ coconut oil and black pepper. Mix up and drop by 1/2 tsp on a cookie sheet, chill, put in a baggie or clean jar. Use for inflammation swallowing whole or mixed in a hot tea and for seasoning food.
3528 2018-07-26 16:47:16 I mean, terrible.  They Were doing great at one point.  Had there own oil, I think.  Self sustaining.  Wow!
3529 2018-07-26 16:47:10 The good news is $CPG only has 40% of 2018-2019 oil production hedged at $77cad. Still have 60% to lock in at a higher price and current market price is $90cad.
3530 2018-07-26 16:47:07 Patchouli oil and Body Shop Mostly Musk
3531 2018-07-26 16:47:07 Dont disagree. At least not vehemently. The GCCs have managed to fly under the radars of the west - probably as money/oil are vital, and nobody wants to repeat the oil embargo. But ascribing that behaviour only to liberals or progressives is rich.

3536 2018-07-26 16:46:37 silver oil
3537 2018-07-26 16:46:36 Sir,hope your so called Vikas will not rob konkan it's natural beauty n make it concrete jungle n pollution mired area...airports,power plants,oil refinery etc.etc.all this really sounds scary for area which is blessed with so much greenery n Ecological sensitive zone.
3538 2018-07-26 16:46:29 im a f***ing dumb*** bc i tried changing my oil and didn’t tighten the filter enough
3539 2018-07-26 16:46:25 Took some of the black seed oil stuff n can’t stop tasting it but i feel great..
3540 2018-07-26 16:46:10 Emang lubricant oil apaan sih?
3541 2018-07-26 16:46:04 ホウゾウインインシュン…
3542 2018-07-26 16:46:04 Same old fundamental flaw. Forty percent, roughly, of extracted oil is used to make petrochemicals without which civilization would literally collapse. Forty percent of these subsidies therefore subsidize manufacturing. That's a pretty big error I think.
3543 2018-07-26 16:45:59 idk why i always put oil in my pan knowing that shit gon pop
3544 2018-07-26 16:45:58 Any liquid is tea when u think about it

Chicken stock? Chicken tea

Lemon juice? Concentrated lemon tea

Gasoline? Refined dino tea

Milk? Tea infused with nutrients perfect for babies

Olive oil? Olive tea with oil as a medium
3545 2018-07-26 16:45:57 get some oil....is legal now.... 
3546 2018-07-26 16:45:52 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
3547 2018-07-26 16:45:42 Busy night last night. Turns out quizzing is thirsty work. All that brain work required constant ale quaffing to oil the cogs. As a result it's a new line up. First up it's a brewery new to TWB, @TestBrewing  EXP Pale. Also new is @FlowerPotsBrew  Stormchaser
3548 2018-07-26 16:45:41 ぐっ！泣ける…エターナルなサマーにするねん…
3549 2018-07-26 16:45:29 Lol hope not...  ain’t no car in this world that cost $800 for a oil change... unless you riding in a Bentley or lambo
3550 2018-07-26 16:45:18 ... I’d find a new mechanic, because attention to detail? Right there in the job description. Or it’s a warning to check thoroughly for I dunno rice in the oil pan or sugar in the window wiper fluid, because “such things” is so vague & yet to threatening...
3551 2018-07-26 16:45:14 เห็นข่าวจับคนเก็บเห็ดอีกแล้ว?

รวยมีบารมีละรอดเหรอ แหมมมม
3552 2018-07-26 16:45:06 I just bought a 10 bottle of cold-pressed coconut oil from a marketplace and I had to throw it away at the airport because it was too big.

I know one of those security agents bout to have flawless skin. 
3553 2018-07-26 16:44:50 i got the essential oil diffuser going in my office and everyone is loving it.. positive vibes on 10 today!
3554 2018-07-26 16:44:45 I’m baking a cake but I had already mixed everything in to realize I’m out of oil sooo wish me luck.. I used butter instead 
3555 2018-07-26 16:44:42 Mom: put this oil so you can feel better and calm
Me: GIVE ME THE MAGIC OILLL
3556 2018-07-26 16:44:41 One of the chief snake oil salesmen....and that's being unfair to decent sales people everywhere.
3557 2018-07-26 16:44:39 Annddd who benefits from higher oil prices?? (Waggles eyebrows)
3558 2018-07-26 16:44:25 Keef really is the icing on the cake. That good good. The suga-honey-ice-tea. The bees knees. Makes me happier than a tornado in a trailer park. Cover me in oil grease and call me slick. The higher you are the closer to god you are. The YEET with a fade away KOBE
3559 2018-07-26 16:44:19 染色考えるの大好き(*´꒳`*)
3560 2018-07-26 16:44:13 Gue ga kebayang oli motor disalahgunakan sebagai lubricant oil
3561 2018-07-26 16:44:11 Darn. Now what will I use to remove rust stain and oil stains in the driveway?
3562 2018-07-26 16:43:46 How do they do this? Would the oil prevent it from freezing?
3563 2018-07-26 16:43:43 Seen it higher than that. Baynards Green, Oxfordshire was more than that for petrol. If you have a diesel, use vegetable oil and save a fortune.
3564 2018-07-26 16:43:42 22$÷fciadiifif oon oil
3565 2018-07-26 16:43:33 How can the separatists turn this into a grievance and another separation  trigger demand 
Haggis oil lamps will be burning long into the night.
3566 2018-07-26 16:43:27 Kalau di aku sih karna aku gapake oil cleansing atau milk cleanser bagus kok hasilnya (walaupun bukan jadi 424) , muka ku kek mulus dan glowing
3567 2018-07-26 16:43:23 I don't think I get the hate on this anyway. Mayo is literally just eggs and oil, add that to dairy, and how is that very different from a whole host of other desserts? It's like when people lost it over Swedish Fish Oreos, ignoring that SF is literally just lingonberry flavor.
3568 2018-07-26 16:43:19 E nalagyan ko ng menthol oil yung mata ko puta this sgx?*#\!\?!\!.
3569 2018-07-26 16:42:51 So for headaches if you get a peppermint oil and rub it on your temples, it’s supposed to really help (it really helped me). For the defuser my mom usually uses rosemary, lavender and eucalyptus, I’ve used it for sinus relief as well
3570 2018-07-26 16:42:47 フォロリクとオスの忘れてたあああああああ！
3571 2018-07-26 16:42:39 add filler foods that are nice like red peppers chunks/diced onion/diced garlic and fry it in a wok/pan use "Fry Light" it's a 1 cal spray used instead of olive oil you can add others that you like, even marinade the chicken or w/e. Like Jake said, Sriracha is peng.
3572 2018-07-26 16:42:32 That coconut oil looks suspicious.
3573 2018-07-26 16:42:28 This curry chicken from bamboo about to be oil shoulda got my own but 
3574 2018-07-26 16:42:19 Your history has colonialism, slavery, imperialism and lots of deaths for money, gold and oil. You’re the last person to teach me how to be a good state!
3575 2018-07-26 16:42:10 Where can I get lavender oil 
3576 2018-07-26 16:42:00 Are you channeling Mr Douglas Fraser there?  He literally said in one of his columns, Westminster spent all the oil money, so tough shit.
3577 2018-07-26 16:41:57 look at the suudi you will deal with them. they do not keep the promise they give you. oil is not falling.
3578 2018-07-26 16:41:53 I have no doubt that it is Russian plan. Just think if NO OIL comes from middle eat, Oil prices goes SKY ROCKET. Who will get benefit?
RUSSIA 

It is evil Russian plan
@maddow @Lawrence @AriMelber
3579 2018-07-26 16:41:48 oil of olay:)) night cream, day cream, eye cream....and so on & so on...
3580 2018-07-26 16:41:27 Genuinely hope you can do well with this. I take CBD oil (from Amsterdam) daily & fail to understand why medical cannabis is illegal in the U.K.

3590 2018-07-26 16:40:24 Yesterday’s Success: I was blessed to spend time alone with each of my children. Enjoy each of them where they are at. Yesterday’s Fail: Baby spilled Melrose oil trying to “help”. I caved and ate some crackers with my dinner. #failingforward
3591 2018-07-26 16:40:23 I use ORS oil R20 @Clicks_SA and I mix it with castor oil. My fro is curly so I never blow dry it. I style it while it’s wet
3592 2018-07-26 16:40:22 I hear Turkey will not be intimidated into not buying Iranian oil.Could that be the problem?It certainly has little or nothing to with the parson being in prison
3593 2018-07-26 16:40:16 迷うなあサラダ油なの？ごま油なの？どっちが好きなの？
3594 2018-07-26 16:40:14 無償の愛を与えられてきた人とマジで話が噛み合わない部分があるのでなるべく全てを冗談めかして喋り噛み合わなかった部分は「これは冗談だからね」とリカバーしていく戦略を取ってる
3595 2018-07-26 16:39:57 “When we are talking about #climatechange, everyone is a contributer, not just one company...Each and everyone of us uses oil and electricity...We are the consumers. We have to change the narrative.” -Francis Bettelyoun #UMNClimateConnections
3596 2018-07-26 16:39:55 It doesn't break the fact their are depleting their cash faster than replacing it. And providing healthcare and other costs for their population is much different than America's population. And again they rely heavily on oil.
3597 2018-07-26 16:39:37 She would swear up and down that motor oil tasted like chocolate syrup if you paid her enough!!! #MediaWhore!!
3598 2018-07-26 16:39:31 It impacted the horse and buggy because of the market not Govt regulating industries out of business. I believe in the free market not cronies capitalism where Govt chooses winners and losers. Obama wanted oil, coal and “non-green” , but expensive energy to succeed #NOtoSocialism
3599 2018-07-26 16:39:26 Best News: No oil leaks whatsoever. (Peter Pan BMW can suck it.)

Moderate News: Car is due for brake fluid flush and oil changge.

Incidental News: Getting the engine steam cleaned because it’s actually an oily mess from past fixed oil leaks.
3600 2018-07-26 16:39:20 Interesting fact: Iris oil is notoriously difficult to extract, and butter made of it costs 13,000 British pounds per kilo. #perfume #amresearching #iris
3601 2018-07-26 16:38:53 Y didn't u advise him
3602 2018-07-26 16:38:50 That tarry patch in omnisphere has oil lol
3603 2018-07-26 16:38:47 My personal favorite is the local mechanic who put an oil change reminder sticker on Mom's car. "John 16:3"

"They will do such things because they have not known the Father or me."


3604 2018-07-26 16:38:41 Oil city here so it's not a truck unless it's jacked uppppppp
3605 2018-07-26 16:38:37 lmao soggy plantain is nasty, if you want to drink oil just drink it straight out the bottle.
3606 2018-07-26 16:38:23 I don’t trust car sales men or the dudes that work at the oil change places. You go in for an oil change & they start talkin about stuff that need be done thats gone be like $500+ I only have $50 sir
3607 2018-07-26 16:38:15 There are many articles that contradict this also. Since there seems to be no concrete evidence, my general rule of thumb is expensive oil for taste, cheap oil for frying. Good for the heart and the wallet.
3608 2018-07-26 16:38:10 I think you're confused with the oil industries subsidies scam-hunter. Without those we'd have billions of additional dollars.
Talk about the poor subsidizing the rich.
Renewables have succeeded despite the subsidies.
Imaging what would happen if ALL subsidies were removed.
3609 2018-07-26 16:37:40 Olive oil my friend. Add some salt/sugar for some texture while rubbing it on the art.
3610 2018-07-26 16:37:34 A leader who "GASP" wanted the oil revenue from his country given to its people. Britain's said hell no all for us America help us. They started a coup put an Oppressive Iatola led govt. In place. Iranians say enough is enough lets try thes islamic guys.
3611 2018-07-26 16:37:23 Oil change 
3612 2018-07-26 16:37:19 Aries: Today you will confuse secret with secrete and exude a foul and corrosive skin oil when interrogated by enemy agents.

3634 2018-07-26 16:34:14 Now I want you to make olive oil series!
3635 2018-07-26 16:34:12 Seriously. John McCain chose the Gov of Alaska- a state that pays people to live there with oil money- as his running mate.
3636 2018-07-26 16:34:07 You use more oil a day than you can pump out!! 

Without oil your military is up shit creek without a paddle! Might be keen to stay in Europe now hey to check those oil tanker routes are clear

3638 2018-07-26 16:33:58 The hottest day of the year is not the day you want your salmon/avocado salad with an olive oil dressing to spill in your bag. My bag smells and the train is about 80°C.

3644 2018-07-26 16:33:11 I got into this argument in the first place because of how ur ppl feel the north fully depends on u, maybe u can still recall the fact that the north contributed a lot to Nigeria prior to d oil discovery. There's a reason y kano is called the commercial state.

3661 2018-07-26 16:31:10 aint it funny how nigeria, the country with the most oil reserves in africa, has an isis allied group operating in it? what a strange coincidence haha
3662 2018-07-26 16:31:06 The government of Italy has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Mia Farrow in a serge wig.
3663 2018-07-26 16:31:05 Another idiotic take. Coal, oil and LNG generate the majority of power in the US. If you're going to transition you don't just abandon.  Well done, again.

3667 2018-07-26 16:30:39 When TLP had brought the state to its knees and ministers were fearing for their lives, Mr Imran Khan was still pouring oil on the flames. So the absence of bloodshed is not for the lack of trying.
3668 2018-07-26 16:30:38 So it's not snake oil anymore is what you're saying? There's actually some value here.

3672 2018-07-26 16:30:26 When the oil sector was still vibrant, universities like Uniport, UNN, FUTO, Unical etc used to dominate - for a simple reason, proximity.

ABU Zaria is still a great school, but since most jobs are in the South, its graduates will not have as many opportunities.
3673 2018-07-26 16:30:20 A few days ago Rouhani threaten Trump and said that there are alternative means to harm the US interest. I guess Rouhani fulfill his promise by forcing the Saudi to shut down its oil export through Bab Almandab, and now this.

3679 2018-07-26 16:30:00 Shri Ravishankarji also misled people of this country way back in 2013. You and party workers took a cycle yaatra demanding roll back of petroleum prices since international market price of crude oil drastically come down per barrel. You accused congress .
3680 2018-07-26 16:29:54 Sept 1980 I watched on Kuwait Radar as Abadan, the world's largest oil refinery was bombed by Iraq as Iraq started the Iraq/Iran war. 300,000 Iraqis died in that war, - disadvantaged and isolated, up against Saddam's Chemical Weapons they fought on. They are being pushed hard.

3693 2018-07-26 16:28:54 Because if it’s what mom/dad earned just a few years ago then the principal itself (as opposed to growth from investments) has been taxed once already, and perhaps quite recently. OTOH it’s all a construct, and the rich use the lower classes as an excuse.
3694 2018-07-26 16:28:54 WCS mixes oil sands bitumen, medium and heavy conventional priced mainly at Hardisty and has become popular bc its large enough to trade off and is dominant in PADD 2.

Peppermint oil can provide pain relief. Rub it on your lower abdomen for cramps, on your lower back for pain, or on the back of your neck to relieve a headache.  
Also add a drop of lemon oil to your water as a natural diuretic to help eliminate bloating.

3725 2018-07-26 16:25:31 Well international aid is stupid, but what he said do4 said is only partly correct, those Nordic countries are homogenous isolationist oil rich nations. And their socialism is run by capitalism.
3726 2018-07-26 16:25:20 U.S. simply lowered its tax rate to the level of most countries. Canada should pay attention and lower its crazy regulations and get its oil out.

3739 2018-07-26 16:23:48 No, but the piperine in black pepper dramatically increases the bioavailability of turmeric compounds. Interestingly, traditional cooking methods in India naturally optimize this - toasting the turmeric in oil first (before adding other ingredients) and combining w/pepper. :)

3753 2018-07-26 16:22:41 He was dealing with the worst environmental disaster in history, remember the BP oil spill &the non stop oil leak for weeks! That destroyed 4 states! Bailing out the banks & auto industry, keeping our economy from going off a cliff! Then those 2 pesky wars, losing 70k jobs a mos.

3785 2018-07-26 16:19:35 Thanks. 
I know that producers in the Western Canadian sedimentary basin receive a lower price for their oil primarily due to transportation bottlenecks (Not enough pipeline capacity.) but I do get tired of people who make it sound like every producer is being paid the WCS price.

3818 2018-07-26 16:16:48 I managed to actually cook real food today. Chicken breasts in olive oil on the stove. Undercooked it a bit, so I had to finish in the microwave, which threw off the texture. Flavor was there, though. Side of spinach. It was good, but a lot of work.
3819 2018-07-26 16:16:37 I'm not sure that passing judgment on hobby choice is a strong argument if your actual career is charlatan snake oil salesmen.
3820 2018-07-26 16:16:37 True, tho one reason natural gas wasn't sanctioned was bc Turkey was almost the only importer and thus would be the only country adjusting to natgas measures. Iran was also not a net gas exporter, suggesting that oil, condensates and products a bigger life line.

T-Rex knew how to economize on personnel.
3823 2018-07-26 16:16:22 If I remember correctly, you have lots of oil and natural gas available, if you were willing to use fracking to get to it.

3840 2018-07-26 16:14:06 The government subsidizes the oil industry, an industry that makes obscene profits of the backs of consumers.

Why not subsidize the agribusiness giants?

It's only money and it's only necessary because Trump screwed with tariffs and, as usual, didn't know what he was doing.

From the California to the New York island
From the Redwood Forest, to the gulf stream waters
This land was made for you and me”

Although charts are not architectural blueprints, having the sense of scale and proportion is critical during an technical analysis, e.g. the scale of a rally or the proportion of a pattern. In other words, a common sense is needed.

3873 2018-07-26 16:10:32 As I stated in a different tweet. Not all refineries have the ability to make gas and not all refineries can use all types of oil. Therefore Canada doesn't have the capacity to refine what is needed

3897 2018-07-26 16:08:58 I hear that massaging coconut oil onto your skin works wonders for stretch marks!

3904 2018-07-26 16:08:15 Since the Pacific Northwest still requires crude oil all that blocking the pipeline will do is force more crude on less safe rail lines and to be delivered by less-safe tankers The risk to the Fraser, Thompson, and Columbia Rivers and the Salish Sea go up if pipeline is cancelled
3905 2018-07-26 16:08:15 Tell me where the oil & gas field/shale plays are?

Is every farmer sitting on such plays?

And if they are, how did the supply gut created by OPEC (mainly Saudi Arabia) work out back in 2014?

Drilling is increasing and shut-in wells are now slowly reopening, but many what ifs.
3906 2018-07-26 16:08:06 And if he owned oil wells, he would say oil is the new cobalt.
3907 2018-07-26 16:08:05 Massive oil and natural gas resources, both proven and estimated, have fueled standoffs amongst China, Vietnam, and the Philippines in the South China Sea.

3923 2018-07-26 16:06:41 I want to buy a 2018. And I don’t know, I don’t own it yet so I haven’t gone to get an oil change yet. I’m going off what I read online from current owners.

3929 2018-07-26 16:06:06 Where is the official news to support your 'well record'?  None. No tankers photo so are they reinjecting oil down thewell? Next stop 1.4 p which can be seen as the base averaged sale range 2.6p  / 1.4p of the 2p share option. Good luck if you still hold, nerves of steel! LOL.

3931 2018-07-26 16:05:54 This is a pear rust, which has become more common here recently. Not fatal but hard to eliminate. Pull off the worst affected leaves to prevent it from spreading, and perhaps try neem oil on the leaves. There is also a dormant spray routine if it gets worse.

3961 2018-07-26 16:02:38 It is interesting, #OOTT , to hear some chatters in the oil trading chatroom refer to some as "noobs" or "newbies" --in oil speculation --when the person referring to the other party as a "noob" has no idea who Marc Rich, Oscar Wyatt, John Deuss,  Andy Hall or Olav Refvik are.

3998 2018-07-26 15:58:47 Had actually forgotten that part. They inteoduced their engine to remain on the old oil spec. 

Maybe explains why they are focusing on the Ferrari being illegal.
3999 2018-07-26 15:58:45 One time when getting an oil change, the guy took out my filter and showed it to me. It had a leaf stuck to it. He asked if I wanted a new one and I told him no thanks I’ll do that myself. Dude put the filter back in WITH THE LEAF.

4034 2018-07-26 15:55:15 I recommend to sulfur ointment for the pimples that don’t dry. Apply it overnight and it works. However it dries your skin a bit. If it’s too dry coconut oil or simple Vaseline overnight on the spot, helps.
4035 2018-07-26 15:55:08 Legalised cannabis oil medicines. Not cannabis. You fucking whopper.
4036 2018-07-26 15:55:07 Twitter me this Batman.
If a dollar spikes hard and oil dropping is all that is noticeable to the casual observers what do the economics of it coming sideways to a sustainable uptrend have to do with today. Look foolish mortal, your dollar may give you prosperity and value again.

4042 2018-07-26 15:54:30 You should read and take seriously the article in August, 2018 Scientific American called UNDERWATER. 

But you won’t. And if you do, you won’t “believe” the stated facts. Or you won’t give a damn, so long as you get your oil money.

4044 2018-07-26 15:54:22 Secretary of State;Islamic Republic of Terrorist of Iran attacked the two large oil tankers closed at the Bab al-Mandeb Strait and also attacked the US embassy in Beijing, China, now they look at you! one step back and they will attack you in WD, US Mailland @SecPompeo @FoxNews

4050 2018-07-26 15:53:39 You can start brands like clean & clear wash for sensitive skin, the use a wash with benzoyl peroxide, then moisturizer your skin with an oil free one. Neutrogena/Aveno/clean & clear
4051 2018-07-26 15:53:33 I finally ordered more rosehip oil. It literally changed my skin so much and since I ran out I’m suffering
4052 2018-07-26 15:53:29 Refinery in Katsina?
To refine which crude oil?
Why not build the refinery in Niger-Delta?
One Nigeria indeed.
4053 2018-07-26 15:53:25 I take Advil liquid gel every 12 hours, every day. Small doses of Cannabis oil helps me but NC politicians are in the pharma pockets. Been considering moving.
4054 2018-07-26 15:53:19 In Other News : Turkey states it will continue to buy oil from Iran.
In unrelated news: US to impose sanctions on Turkey.
Hmm 
4055 2018-07-26 15:53:11 Yeah, but I think the oil be stronger and last longer than the wax lol
4056 2018-07-26 15:53:07 I need to stop bullshitting and get my oil changed
4057 2018-07-26 15:53:02 Bless you bro, your head get oil. You took the words right out of my mouth.

4059 2018-07-26 15:52:56 Oil works. As in spills.
4060 2018-07-26 15:52:54 Know what I could go for? Steak pizzaiola. It's so good. They use chuck steak, and you bake it in the oven with some tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, and oregano. It gets so tender when you bake the chuck in the oven. I could go for that.
4061 2018-07-26 15:52:54 Even a little country like Ireland has more growth if u look on the table of EU country's. Ireland are on top and UK your 5th largest economy on the bottom you owe 3 trillion pound so where has all the money gone oh you had Scottish oil for years.
You's were called sick man of EU
4062 2018-07-26 15:52:53 This is what happens when mammals decide to burn a trillion tonnes of coal, a trillion barrels of oil and a trillion cubic metres of gas & release it into a wafer thin atmosphere.

4065 2018-07-26 15:52:40 What’s the name of oil tanker allegedly attacked in Red Sea? Now you’re thinking about it, right? Why Houthis claimed tis“warship”, Dammam?
4066 2018-07-26 15:52:37 Whatever conditioner you get, add rosemary & peppermint essential oils (and if your deep conditioning you can add coconut oil, olive oil, or Shea butter) I personally like Aussie conditioner because it leaves your hair soft and bouncy even after it’s rinsed.

4068 2018-07-26 15:52:24 The "look at Venezuela" argument is a bad argument. They relied on oil revenues in order to government  (fiscally) spend. The oil revenues fell out from under them.

4080 2018-07-26 15:51:16 If the U.S. cut oil demand by just 10% it would cut world demand by 2.5% and oil prices would tank. We could see $25/barrel and Russian bankruptcy.
4081 2018-07-26 15:51:13 It’s the oil magnates that do more harm here, go pester them. It’s been proven over and over again that even the full lifecycle of an EV is cleaner and greener than any other car, and Tesla are trying to promote that adoption to stop more emissions going into our atmosphere.

4087 2018-07-26 15:50:16 It's hard to champion human rights when we've killed hundreds of thousands of people in the Middle East to loot oil. And still, it's not enough. Government is filled with warmongers. They don't want peace. They want to death and destruction.
4088 2018-07-26 15:50:12 Looks like turkey may well be scrapping its iran oil sanctions after all

4096 2018-07-26 15:49:36 How many years of oil to produce jet fuel is left in the world? We better start building and upgrading rail like China and Europe... Lol
4097 2018-07-26 15:49:32 Sadly, there is a grain of truth in @jkenney's comment re. energy. Uncertainty around pipelines - in part b/c of TMX and C69 - has affected investors' perception of oil industry. Federal/provincial Tsunami of new regs hasn't helped. Also doesn't help if PMO denies this reality.

4101 2018-07-26 15:49:21 But you’ll do nothing when they slaughter the Kurds. Almost like the Kurds have a political system that just might work for the many rather than the oil companies
4102 2018-07-26 15:49:17 全ての料理はオイルなしに作れない…(作れるのもあるかも、え、あるのかなぁ)
4103 2018-07-26 15:49:16 I agree that these spiritual accounts that sell you boxes of energy (LMFAO @ you if you follow that shit snake oil head ass) are scammy and don't know shit but most of y'all mad she said stop stealing from self checkout 
4104 2018-07-26 15:49:16 Let’s see... y’all know the pans they make the personal pizzas in? When I first started working there, the employee “showing me what to do” was just wiping out the old oil with a rag and then putting the new dough in the pan to prep. NO WASHING THEM.

4107 2018-07-26 15:49:06 Hi Kiimberly! The information in that link is all we have from the presenters. With doors at 8 p.m., my best bet would be that the Snake Oil Salesmen would go on between 8:30 and 9 p.m. with Petunia going on when they wrap up.
4108 2018-07-26 15:49:03 Oil money and hot women.  Good choice!
4109 2018-07-26 15:48:59 Our country never shld have sacrificed our factories & jobs for global socialism. Yes, to reverse the effects = short term hurdles, but well worth it to gain our domestic market back & stronger country.

4119 2018-07-26 15:47:22 I have worked in the oil industry. I understand that it is a big ship to turn, but if we don’t turn the wheel now and suffer through the pain then we will never get where we need to go for our children.

4121 2018-07-26 15:47:20 Way to disassociate from the system: Make your own bath and body products using ingredients like coconut oil, essential oils, and herbal extracts.

4133 2018-07-26 15:46:33 hi Kerry! Palm oil is a very big focus for us right now, and I'm pleased to confirm that we only use RSPO certified sustainable oil in our snacks

Buhari is wasting billions for oil exploration in the North.

4151 2018-07-26 15:43:53 Why isn’t there one universal system for logging car maintenance? Always feel like an idiot when I get my oil changed
4152 2018-07-26 15:43:39 I've used Vit E oil alone for years to promote skin growth. Shea butter adds an emulsion to Vit E that allows it to stick better. Good stuff. I'm using it now to soften a surgical scar.

4158 2018-07-26 15:43:08 Fuel price 2: In the mid-eighties the rest of the world had deregularised their oil industries. SA govt. refused because of the oil boycott against thje country. Won't happen now too because it is a handy cash cow for SA Government.

4167 2018-07-26 15:42:14 First day of oil ckeanser. Seriously, worth it. I can feel the tiny DIRT in my skin comes out. This is amazing.
4168 2018-07-26 15:42:06 Only I would tell myself to schedule an oil change at 7:30 am knowing damn well it’s too early for me and sure enough I get here at 8:40
4169 2018-07-26 15:41:59 "Quick Lane" is questionable since I've been sitting here an hour and 45 mins for a scheduled oil change. @richmondford #RVA
4170 2018-07-26 15:41:57 Boot Turkey out of @nato as well. Americans should never die for that 3rd world hell hole. Turkey supports ISxx by purchasing looted Syrian oil, killed RU's ambassador, persecutes Christians and openly promotes the destruction of Israel via an Islamic Army.

4173 2018-07-26 15:41:37 Why should an increase in world oil production cause food shortages in Venezuela? Venezuela is a case of capitalists punishing a whole country because its leader is not neoliberal. There is no world food supply problem causing shortages in Venezuela; capitalism is inefficient.

4182 2018-07-26 15:40:38 Yes, I see. There might be a silver lining, though. From what I have heard, the undertaken law/regulatory changes are the result of task forces with members from Government & oil cos. Still, new investment will take time to bear fruits.

4186 2018-07-26 15:40:13 The fuel price is hitting the headlines again. Together with calls of a fuel boycott, price reduction, a call for the deregulation of the oil industry has also been thrown into the melting pot. Nothing new. This has been a topic that has been in the news since the middle 80's.

There's more.  Remind me. I'll get back to this.

4193 2018-07-26 15:39:45 The REAL reason for sanctions is because Turkey's President Erdogan is against sanctions on Iran, its neighbor & strategic partner. You've threatened sanctions against any country who imports oil from Iran. Turkey imports huge amounts. So it's your back door punishment. #LIAR

4228 2018-07-26 15:36:45 I was talking about Helichrysum oil in my video today, I felt silly, because I dont know that much about it and I didnt have a book.  This talk a little about it, but not that much about its wonderful uses.

4234 2018-07-26 15:36:17 It's an interesting sector. The virgin run by the sand companies was amazing but then oil turned back down and they loaded up on debt, cut dividends, and issued more shares. No longer Ferraris but see if some of the names have better finances.

4243 2018-07-26 15:35:28 One of the keys was fussy - similarly minor electrical things have been its only issue. I’d say as long as you trust your dealership (and try to only take it to the dealership unless for oil changes) it’s a peach.

4254 2018-07-26 15:34:40 if you used synthetic oil (i do) it’s normally more expensive, but it can definitely be in that range just bc a full blown oil change is a process, not just topping it off.

4301 2018-07-26 15:29:34 what about those arabian princes that have gazillions of dollars from selling oil? i guess i would like to be as underpriviledged as them
4302 2018-07-26 15:29:16 How so? What IS shameful is to suggest that these people have the option to choose a more expensive cooking oil when they struggle to feed their families or send their children to school.
4303 2018-07-26 15:28:54 Why are they building refinery in Kastina?  Is it one of the oil producing state or what? Or is it anyway closer to where oil exploration is taking place
4304 2018-07-26 15:28:53 @narendramodi_in Sir, if we would like to successfully compet with the international trade war & rising oil price ; instead of depreciating INR with global currencies India should introduced  sector wise duty draw back Because India is a net importer country.

4321 2018-07-26 15:27:14 Yeah, I'll be looking to those for sure, appreciate that - but if QEP has commitments for 95% of its oil it is protected on a # of levels. But that's notable, so, thanks.

4324 2018-07-26 15:27:05 Standard Oil is the standard monopoly horror story. They cut the price of oil and gasoline continuously. Monopolies are only bad when they use their market power to reduce supply and raise prices. Standard Oil only kept their monopoly by continuously lowering their prices.

4327 2018-07-26 15:26:58 It is not impossible to test positive for THC on a drug screen while using CBD oil. Interestingly, NSAIDS (like naproxen or ibuprofen) can give you a false positive.

BC allows USA Alaska Tankers on its coast & sells millions of tons of Coal to USA
4330 2018-07-26 15:26:40 This is also due, I'm sure, to the fact that they just said they will keep buying Iranian oil. NOT SOMETHING A NATO MEMBER SHOULD DO!

4332 2018-07-26 15:26:31 Oil is their saving grace, and it has afforded them with extreme riches that have been mostly squandered on promoting Islam.  If it wasn't for all those riches, Islam would not be nearly as popular as it is today (because that popularity is forced).

4391 2018-07-26 15:20:41 Of course. But surely we can’t expect them to grow to a quasi-monopoly and huge-profits stage. They will be just one of the players.

Saudis are also massively investing in other forms of energy. But it will never get them to the same dominant oligopoly position they had for oil.

4400 2018-07-26 15:19:53 I think you have to dig deeper. The problems with Islam mostly stem from salafism, a relatively orthodox/backward and intolerant strain that has grown in importance using our oil dollars. But orthodox Christianity is problematic too. And yes, some Buddhists do bad things too.

4445 2018-07-26 15:14:45 Yes! Put a lil hair oil or something on it before bed and have him sleep with something on his head. It’ll help the hair stay laying down longer so even if he needs a haircut it’ll at least be laying down lol
4446 2018-07-26 15:14:43 im covered in at least 103 oils or serums on my body everyday; tea tree oil, rosehip oil, witch hazel, blossom oil, rose water, shea baby oil, etc..
4447 2018-07-26 15:14:29 Bisa, tapi sebelumnya pake cleanser yang oil base sayang ex vaseline, olive oil, atau milk cleanser. Napa?  Karna kotoran yang dikulit kita itu kebanyakan yang bersifat larut lemak. Which is gabakal ketampol kalo cuman pake toner. Semangat cantik
4448 2018-07-26 15:14:26 Fucking stellar day in oil today, and overall performance looking good despite being carted merciless over ECB despite getting direction right. Gym time now to relax

4450 2018-07-26 15:14:21 So happy for you dude. This is exciting as fuck! Secrets of beard-care (if you decide to grow one out): refined coconut oil for softness and pick an essential oil for fragrance. I like lavender. :D

4462 2018-07-26 15:13:04 The USSR also faced foreign attacks on the Soviet economy. ... When the Soviet Union's oil and gas revenue dropped dramatically, the USSR began to lose its hold on Eastern Europe.

4468 2018-07-26 15:11:47 In some ways yes, but ultimately big oil has been working hard for short term returns, undermining efforts to change our energy sources & not investing in our collective long term sustainability.  They need to take responsibility.

4473 2018-07-26 15:11:35 @SRuhle Stephanie not only doesn’t Trump understand trade! He doesn’t care! He’s a pretender, not a fixer! I mean what does anybody expect from a snake oil demagogue?
4474 2018-07-26 15:11:29 Cuban-backed puppet dictator of whom? Venezuela's oil reserve would seem to indicate Maduro is no puppet of anyone. As with Castro, I disagree with speech suppression and other human rights restrictions, but when defending against the empire extreme measures may be justified.
4475 2018-07-26 15:11:28 Should never cook with olive oil.
4476 2018-07-26 15:11:15 Do tell?  I see Nelson fighting the algae and oil drilling. Not to mention his work on sensible gun control. As a bonus, he got my vet husband his medications when the red tape was killing us at the VA.
4477 2018-07-26 15:11:10 So the discussion on how 7 million Igbod were killed over oil won’t be had? Or the damage generations after are facing?

4480 2018-07-26 15:10:57 I agree with the point you’re making. But let’s be clear... this crap is dangerous. Both governmentally and to Trump politically. The outrage machine is ridiculous, but they have legit beef when POTUS gets tied up with private enterprise. Really needs to stop.
4481 2018-07-26 15:10:56 I think I'm leaking! Ahhhh, I'm leaking! There's oil everywhere!

4495 2018-07-26 15:09:32 Loving my @bpnutrition oil! I’ve been using it for about a week and a half and it’s fantastic.
4496 2018-07-26 15:09:32 Lubbock again today for this damn appointment and oil change, Lubbock tomorrow for the final part of my 3 part exam, work this weekend, and hopefully an interview call Monday...and 2 week training in Alb. 
4497 2018-07-26 15:09:32 In Mangalore it is called Gojju. Same difference. With roasted chillies, turmeric, hing, salt, tamarind & a little jaggery, roughly ground & then seasoned with mustard & curry leaves in coconut oil.
4498 2018-07-26 15:09:22 While not specifically focused on habitability, @sapinker's TED talk shows that world is overall getting better, not worse. Global warming certanly is a problem, but not one we can't overcome. But unfortunately some people are in oil industry sponsored denial about it happening
4499 2018-07-26 15:09:21 If I were still in #Michigan, I'd be torn between voting for @gretchenwhitmer or @AbdulElSayed  for Governor--both have pluses in their column for sure. However, the candidacy of @ShriForMI feels hella sketchy and like a bit of a snake-oil-salesman.
4500 2018-07-26 15:09:09 We'll just have to make oil from, I don't know, acorns? XD
4501 2018-07-26 15:08:47 Certainly did in my mother’s family. All of them had oil wells on their land and all who lived on land died of cancer. Those that moved away fared better.

4503 2018-07-26 15:08:02 Real friends give yu tea tree oil when u have a pimple
4504 2018-07-26 15:08:02 Venezuela was doing this as well. And then something went wrong. Their economy could not handle the collapse in oil prices. No more wealth to spread around.
4505 2018-07-26 15:08:01 Petro based economy what a curse... if they only didnt have the largest oil reserves...
4506 2018-07-26 15:07:42 Thursday: Get an oil change for only $9.96

Most makes and models!
4507 2018-07-26 15:07:36 The ongoing and future success in our offshore petro industry is/will be largely the result of the forward-thinking from Nalcor to engage in aggressive seismic work which opens up new areas for development. That was a Williams govt initiative paid for by  oil revenues.
4508 2018-07-26 15:07:28 Your tweets and trans are amazing. Please rest well. It looks like sleep is alluding you. Melatonin, lavender oil, staying off electronics at least 1 hr prior to sleep, journaling thoughts that might be keep you

4512 2018-07-26 15:07:01 So the next challenge is making Olive oil? Wait, did I say it out loud? Of course you can! #SpreadItLikeButtaaa
4513 2018-07-26 15:06:44 Patient asked me when I was going to get really serious about my practice and start introducing essential oil to my patients.  I could start at no cost to me!  
4514 2018-07-26 15:06:43 Shut down by oil lobbyists? The oil industry isn’t even a player in the US electricity market! And it wasn’t shut down. Most nuclear plants have been operating since the 1970’s (uninterrupted) but now cannot generate electricity cheap enough to compete with natural gas.

4517 2018-07-26 15:06:26 Bugatti Veyron. Hit repeatedly and very hard with the ugly stick and designed with no idea on how stupid it would be change the oil. Only of interest to toasters who boast about how much it costs to change the oil (or the tyres).
4518 2018-07-26 15:06:18 So you'd rather have a meth freak making minimum wage changing your oil??
4519 2018-07-26 15:06:11 A 25:1 CBD oil is the only medicine that touches my neuropathy - & it has none of the terrible side effects of the usual Rx drugs - and no head-change, too.
4520 2018-07-26 15:05:54 FANG slowly biting the dust with $NFLX $FB becoming source of funds. Is that indication of top as leaders top before general market? Is $GOOGL $AMZN enough to carry on? Does leadership shift to financials and oil?
4521 2018-07-26 15:05:48 Sajid Javid changed his mind about cannabis oil after looking at the facts
4522 2018-07-26 15:05:24 @1985Kay Kazungu Kambi through his Company Riva oil company used Giriama ranch, Bamba-Kilifi title deed to acquire a loan of 250M and now the land is set to be auctioned. Talk of coastal crooks that feed on the community's blood
4523 2018-07-26 15:05:18 Protesters, court cases, banks that support oil, we've got to use every available means to make exon a hated/unpopular corporation
4524 2018-07-26 15:05:10 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
4525 2018-07-26 15:05:05 There are far more reasons that countries hold dollars other than to buy oil. BTW there is an increased reason for countries to hold dollars- the US is now the world's largest oil producer and a massive natural gas producer so there is need to hold dollars to buy from the US
4526 2018-07-26 15:05:02 He supported him during Chavez. But his policies were continued by his successors. And it's funny all of OPEC relies on oil for their economies and none of them have had their economies go the way of Venezuela.
4527 2018-07-26 15:05:00 I believe that if you boycott palm oil, by the time these companies decide to switch to another, for example, soybean, they will be sanctioned at the administrative level. I hope...
4528 2018-07-26 15:04:55 I’ve learned that CBD oil works great with headaches and just any plain body aches.
4529 2018-07-26 15:04:53 More oil in your belly! Fresh anointing! Birth the Son of God!
4530 2018-07-26 15:04:51 Buy oil fracking companies instead.
4531 2018-07-26 15:04:50 Rose hip & tea tree oil are saving my life 
4532 2018-07-26 15:04:47 Agreed. I've seen the photos from the salvage yard. No visible damage at all. The dealer specializes in Volvos they reconstruct themselves; it's their niche. Good online reviews. But replacing the axle + oil pan shouldn't be over $2k.
4533 2018-07-26 15:04:44 He's making it easier for the oil and gas industries to profit, at the expense of the wildlife. Agree it needs to be changed, but it's a shame the experts haven't been listened to.
4534 2018-07-26 15:04:39 every single vendor cooks their chips in the same oil as animal based food so not even veggies can eat them
4535 2018-07-26 15:04:39 In tight oil markets, we see the opportunity for volatility and potential for manipulation. We must continue to find ways to protect consumers & make sure that we're breaking monopolies at the pump.
4536 2018-07-26 15:04:38 Be interesting to look at fergies spend relative to today’s market.  he bought the best players in as well. They are still the richest club in the world so spending money isn’t ever going to be an issue as it’s generated through revenue not pumped in oil money.
4537 2018-07-26 15:04:07 somewhere right now is a diesel truck packd with oil based vinyl stuck in traffic.the exhaust fumes are blowing out a babys lungs in a pram, while a file get downloaded with all the fuss of a snowflake,but it seems music isn’t enough.u need to fill your ikea shelves,don’t u boys
4538 2018-07-26 15:04:06 Frying is now banned in England, as Scotland declares independence and seizes all the oil.
4539 2018-07-26 15:03:53 Exactly, on FOX there's a DC reporter talking about NK, she said "My sources say there getting oil from China/Russia so Trump sanctions failed" WRONG! NK's oil sanctions go back many years before Trump and China/Rus has sneaked in oil throughout those years.

4547 2018-07-26 15:03:33 Hi, you do, but the advise I got was that you spray it with spritz (20% oil + 80% Water) and then separate it with your hands. You can also check on their twitter account, they have threads on how to take care of your natural hair.

4563 2018-07-26 15:02:19 Plastic is made from oil - There are numerous processes that can turn it back into useable oils. It can also be reused as a building material (processed into plastic bricks) and generally as a recycled material. Loads of uses. Even just burn it as a fuel and re-cycle the gases.

4565 2018-07-26 15:01:52 But you dont admit that there's an enormous amount of artificial demand for the dollar due to it being the currency of oil, international settlements and trade and fx reserves? You dont think thats going to dry up in the next decade?

4583 2018-07-26 15:00:01 @LiveKellyRyan that was a great tip @KellyRipa tea tree oil and olive oil for ear infection.
4584 2018-07-26 15:00:01 I just quickened  baby you got that oil *church mother voice*, in case you were wondering how reneging is going
4585 2018-07-26 14:59:57 Coconut oil works wonders for my beard
4586 2018-07-26 14:59:50 You need any baby oil applied?
4587 2018-07-26 14:59:38 Vegetable oil. Olive oil only for frying

4590 2018-07-26 14:59:04 Great book, reading it at the beach and the binding does not love coconut oil it seems. Makes it look really read through haha.
4591 2018-07-26 14:59:02 I did realize he was in gas and oil as well. Shell you say?
4592 2018-07-26 14:58:53 Smart okay, I have to get them soon though because the brakes are already starting to eat through the metal on the rotors and I’m 800 miles past needing an oil change 
4593 2018-07-26 14:58:53 Selling snake oil??
4594 2018-07-26 14:58:44 Because a trade deal allows for sanctions, without the deal you lose the sanctions, and an arms race begin. Some people just want war, intelligent people make deals and part of the deal is to impose sanctions to prevent war in exchange for oil and other commidities
4595 2018-07-26 14:58:38 Let's make a list.. Who occupied who?.Lets start wth Turkey, planted Turks in Cyprus,British planted Brits in Ireland and the list ll will continue forever..not evolved humans still fighting for territory and bloody oil too
4596 2018-07-26 14:58:31 Thanks ed,boss got her from pound yrs back&she stayed at oil lease ,she had personality&loved cat equipment,if you left the door open or it had a broke out window she would sleep on the seat. Kinda sad but i saw our other lease dog jump up on dozer track 2 look in seat this morn
4597 2018-07-26 14:58:12 Similar to the Keeley Work Station but a comp, transparent drive and onboard delay. Would want it to cover the whole range of delays, most importantly oil can. I’d call it the Spaghetti 6-Gun and I can guarantee you’d sell at least 1.

4599 2018-07-26 14:57:45 I took my truck to Jiffy Lube when I was 17 and they failed to re-secure the oil pan. All the oil leaked out and my engine threw a rod, basically destroying it. Jiffy Lube’s response was basically “prove it was our fault”.
4600 2018-07-26 14:57:41 Thank you @mochegato. Some days are easier than others. I guess it's a tough concept for some to understand that a surplus of oil, natural gas, etc. is a good thing. But a surplus of fresh product is a bad thing as it goes to waste. One would think that is logical.
4601 2018-07-26 14:57:39 Top or bottom ones. ? I had all 4 out at same time. Nasty . Salted water swills. And clove oil help. Not good for checking for seasoning tho lol.

4606 2018-07-26 14:57:01 How does he kill competition? He only dominates cement, he failed in other markets (Juice, Noodles etc). Now he is building refinery everybody else is looking... Soon you will say he killed competition in Oil and Gas.
4607 2018-07-26 14:57:01 Again I will look for the "Amerca's possible alternative to Canada's heavy oil" article when I get home - you are right I am not well versed on the chemistry - I am well versed on the geopolitics
4608 2018-07-26 14:56:55 This pure, raw coconut oil smells divine. I feel like getting raw. Shit. 

Make me wanna eat myself. 

Might try it. 
4609 2018-07-26 14:56:45 That's true but it's still much better than oil or coal, and opposite to unusable wind and solar, it complements nuclear very well for the peaks of consumption/seasonal variations.

4615 2018-07-26 14:56:19 But if they had a number, they had an oil price assumption.  Did they at least tell you that as they squirmed and wriggled in the face of a really obvious and simple question?

4626 2018-07-26 14:54:53 Anyways my parents brought some vitamin syrup bc I’m always tired and it’s literally fish oil with orange flavour and it tastes like you dipped a fish in orange juice

4638 2018-07-26 14:53:50 I tried to change the oil in a car. Not my car. My neighbors
4639 2018-07-26 14:53:38 I am no expert on Russia, but it seems to me the driving force behind Putin's psyops is desperation to control oil. Look at Rosneft deals, Russian deal on Niger oilfields, Exxon and Tillerson, Middle East. To me, what is driving him is oil to shore up his money and his power.
4640 2018-07-26 14:53:37 If oil drops below 46 dollars a barrel then we could be holding a Bill for 600 million dollars as the companies will be able to pull the plug.This on the face of it is not a good deal for NL.

4643 2018-07-26 14:53:18 ALSO: Trump tariffs have targeted the heart of the US economy: Farming-Agriculture, Auto Industry, Aluminum-Steel-Manufacturing. This is intentional and willful. ALSO: the secret deal with Putin in Helsinki -- Oil and Gas is likely in the mix.

4648 2018-07-26 14:53:06 Higher oil prices don’t bad management  and failed business model
4649 2018-07-26 14:52:38 Have you had someone feed you strawberries soaked in sparkling wine and fresh cream while he oils you down with baby oil and spanks you with a hair brush?
4650 2018-07-26 14:52:36 It’s going to be up to the doctors to make sure they only prescribe it as needed. We’ve had the predicted problems here in the States with the legalization of it. That said, the CBD oil has been showing to be very beneficial to certain patients.
4651 2018-07-26 14:52:31 No shit, I just bought THC oil from the pharmacy, no script, fucking blitzed!
4652 2018-07-26 14:52:24 I remember a certain despicable group of 'conservatives' that pushed for the invasion of Iraq to loot their oil. Made up a conspiracy of WMD's These criminals cost the lives of close to a million Iraqi's. 5000+ dead USA troops and countless disabled

4658 2018-07-26 14:51:44 Hello doll, thanks for reaching out! Product images like the first one are for graphics. The bottle you received is correct, it has 8 fluid ounces of the oil. The space at the top is standard and no oil is missing. Have a fabulous day!
4659 2018-07-26 14:51:43 It is very simple, those things may have made prices increase anyway, that is true, but Brexit weakened the pound and as oil is traded in USD it means it is an even larger increase here than it would have been without Brexit. It isn't complicated.
4660 2018-07-26 14:51:31 I asked for the break down and they didn’t have it. I was told the province will net 800m-1bln once our investment is paid off, cost of borrowing etc. All very dependent on what oil prices are
4661 2018-07-26 14:51:25 Thanks Joey! I used my bare hands to pull out the seeds and membrane, which is where I know I went wrong! But I didn’t know you could put olive oil on beforehand! After the burn I soaked in olive oil, milk, ice cubes, half and half, hot water and soap! 
4662 2018-07-26 14:51:21 Obviously! It hasn’t been twinned yet!

This pipeline, as per our PM and his cabinet is for expanding operations in the oil patch for the purpose of selling and shipping oil to Asia...through the Burrard Inlet and Metro Vancouver. 

It has nothing to do with “greenies”!
4663 2018-07-26 14:51:08 In regards to Iran, American belligerence is three pronged - a desire for complete regional hegemony, an unquenchable thirst for oil and an irrepressible need to exact revenge. The so-called 'Iran nuclear threat' only acts as a pretext for US aggression.

4711 2018-07-26 14:45:50 I don't really miss her. She was selling snake oil. We have enough of that today.

4715 2018-07-26 14:45:45 i like acrylics because it dries quick, i like watercolors because of the somewhat unpredictability, but i love oils for the texture. my personal favorite is oil :) yours is so pretty!!
4716 2018-07-26 14:45:30 What I don't understand about dem voters they have to see how well the economy is doing. Why do they listen to these lifelong snake oil salesman. If they were going to help you they already would have most have been in office forever. DUH it's commonsense.
4717 2018-07-26 14:45:27 Oh my word how far gone do you have to be to listen or watch that snake oil salesman!
4718 2018-07-26 14:45:17 中古も高いし、商用車として酷使されてるから、程度が良いのが有りません。私的にはYAMAHAのGEAR-Cをオススメですね、積んでるエンジンがジョグ系と同じなので、2000キロに１回OIL交換してれば、調子良いです。過去にJOG ZRとBOXのDX同じ系のエンジンの新車から乗り出して消耗品交換だけでした。
4719 2018-07-26 14:45:06 Oil prices pare gains after earlier rise on Saudi news: Oil prices traded broadly unchanged on Thursday after an announcement that Saudi Arabia would suspend some oil shipping in the Red Sea had initially sent prices higher.
4720 2018-07-26 14:44:51 Yeah maybe if the CIA attacked us twice this year to destabilize us and the only commodity we had was oil . But that isn't the case . So .. Oops your talking points are idiotic.
4721 2018-07-26 14:44:49 @SecretaryZinke Since you'll be visiting Theodore Roosevelt National Park, is there any way that you can condemn the oil refinery that is being built three miles outside the park's border. If not, stay away from the park. You are tarnishing TR's legacy.
4722 2018-07-26 14:44:47 First of all, what was your beef with Chavez. Second, his regime was propped up by Venezuela's enormous oil & gas reserves laid down by the giant Orinoco river over millennia. Mexico is an entirely different beast. And yes that's a reference to Sicario and Juarez, The Beast.
4723 2018-07-26 14:44:43 @BraveTart Help with yeasted waffles please? I made them on a rectangular Vitantonio Belgian waffler (got second-hand). Plates are Teflon but my waffles stuck (once with no grease, once with very light oil). I ended up with half the waffle stuck on top and half on bottom.

4726 2018-07-26 14:44:20 Never know what to do while I'm getting my oil changed
4727 2018-07-26 14:44:01 when the inflation of oil is making American consumer to pay $69.30/barrel while the same barrel was paid $45 before the cancellation of the Iranian deal, then you know that the winner of that trade war doesn't bear an American Flag on his right shoulder.
4728 2018-07-26 14:44:01 I started CBD oil yesterday, and I’m hoping it’s a step in the right direction to make me feel better.

4739 2018-07-26 14:42:49 The important thing about steak is to fry it in its own fat/oil.  That gives it the *best* flavor.
a little garlic powder and paprika also bring out the steak flavor well, adding and emphasizing without covering.
4740 2018-07-26 14:42:38 Does anyone here use jiffy lube for their oil changes? How does it work? Cause I'm goddamn sick of having to get up at 6am and drop my car off for the entire day to get that done at a mechanic.

4753 2018-07-26 14:41:09 Yes - so many ramifications, in particular the immediate derailment of USA directed Eco zealots that FN are all anti oil/logic.

4755 2018-07-26 14:40:55 I live on a family farm that is surrounded by family farms, but it's not a job anymore. Most people out here work in the oil & gas industry in addition to their farms.

Yemeni drones carried out a series of attacks on the international airport of Abu Dhabi, capital of UAE.

The new Yemen-made drone,  is called Samad3.

Samad2 was the one that hit the Saudi oil company Aramco in Riyadh earlier this month.

4770 2018-07-26 14:40:06 Get back in the pickup and go home good oil’ boy
4771 2018-07-26 14:40:03 we love waste. it is a waste to focus solely on oil. it is a waste to keep building more suburbs and highways instead of dense housing and transit. it was a waste to build 1 giant dam instead of a bunch of small ones. it is a waste to cast our 1 vote for 1 of 3 parties w/ 0 ideas
4772 2018-07-26 14:40:01 Every morning I continue to put coconut oil on my face & know im going to go to war with SC’s heat .
4773 2018-07-26 14:39:59 HA Ashton go open your eyes!! Everything around you is made from oil and natural gas. These farmers you are talking about would love to have cheap effecient energy to help them escape poverty. The Antartic Ice has grown this year. Stop reading Fearmongering articles!!
4774 2018-07-26 14:39:59 did not expect $$ to fall so much after ecb presser. i was out of touch with expectations because i don't see how the guy was anything but neutral. i guess some where hoping for a hawkish turn but based on what? oil is down, growth is modest, politics are mediocre. so what?
4775 2018-07-26 14:39:52 Wudhu je sis.. haha gurau.. tkde apa skang juz guna hada labo punya oil je..n miracle toner tu best.. sis nk try cosrx punya cleanser pulak..
4776 2018-07-26 14:39:49 I got more too early and paid over 0.3p. Hopefully we get an RNS on T-45 next week & possibly Dino-2 as well. Podcasts are all well & good but it’s about RNSs and hopefully illustrating the impressive initial flows haven’t fallen offf a cliff. Any more oil being loaded on trains?
4777 2018-07-26 14:39:45 Damnnn yo shit long ... dudes hair always grow faster , i use coconut and olive oil . But I be dying it a lot so maybe it stunts the growth just a lil .
4778 2018-07-26 14:39:35 Not worried about $NGD because I fully expected a final beating on earnings, but $CPG hurts. Was chasing this hoping that a higher oil price in Q2 would fix a lot of the problems but that was a big mistake. Can understand long term investor's frustrations at the moment.
4779 2018-07-26 14:39:35 have you tried tea tree oil?

4783 2018-07-26 14:39:19 Oil is not running out. There are large oil fields off shore down the west coast of Scotland from a survey carried out in the 80’s. It cannot be tapped because of Fastlane submarine base. Deemed to dangerous for nuclear subs to navigate through. All kept quiet and but in reserve.

4787 2018-07-26 14:39:08 Its a combination. Originally an interest in other energy options, then institutional investors realized they could make 10%+ guaranteed for 20-40 yr and pressured their big oil investees to build the wind/solar. Buys social license. Sells Ngas. Makes ppl poor. /2
4788 2018-07-26 14:38:57 lol i love how you were originally arguing against envtal regulations but now yr advocating for them. & here i agree! third party oversight would be great!!! regulations to prevent oil spills is possible!
4789 2018-07-26 14:38:55 While I respect your position on Suzuki, we don’t have to pretend his science is half-baked in order to disagree w/his views on the oil sands, nor withdraw support for the institution for recognizing his broader achievements.
4790 2018-07-26 14:38:52 @TM2LeahDawn  Please search on Google about CBD oil treatment for muscular dystrophy . I read it helps with muscular dystrophy in many different ways I started researching it after I seen a show on TV about it call me crazy but I thought I'd throw that out there.

4793 2018-07-26 14:38:40 Vegan Baking Tip: If you want to substitute oil/butter in a recipe you have a few options. If you're making muffins or cakes the best is: applesauce. For brownies or cookies try nut butters or tahini. You can find which one works best for you!

Bottom line: I think you need s plausible explanation for the title status.

4812 2018-07-26 14:36:17 one of my only regrets this year is not discovering, soon enough, @Target 's new essential oil based body spray and perfume that is affordable!!! Ive been looking for sth like this for a long time. personal fave? The Apricot Bloom line
4813 2018-07-26 14:36:05 The non-commodity part is a sure indictment on the countries that have fared horribly, economically, despite having tonnes and tonnes of minerals deposits and barrels of oil. And a pointer to economic mismanagement by African leaders in these countries.
4814 2018-07-26 14:36:02 I think you must read too much of The Guardian. Oil prices have increased due to Trump pulling out of Iran deal. Saudi Arabia and a Russia cut production. Venezuela is in turmoil...!
4815 2018-07-26 14:35:57 Maddening!
Canada,  a resource rich nation,  importing oil ( the lifeblood of the world ) . How outrageous is this...difficult to believe.
We can clearly see how absolutely brilliant our federal/provincial governments are in their ambitions to destroy Canada.

Boil John Cowell in oil then round up every person of every race who's committed crimes/violence against another race on the BART and boil them in oil, too. Everyone has the right to ride public transit without being raped, robbed, murdered, terrorized.
4820 2018-07-26 14:35:14 LOL. The oil industry collapsed in 2014-15 following the decrease in the oil barrel value on international markets. That's what put Alberta in deficits. Are you accusing liberals to have an impact on oil prices? I guess that's what happens when you rely too much on oil royalties.

4827 2018-07-26 14:34:07 Sure, but then it's too late. Oil is in the water.  CEO's aren't on an oil platform, ever.  If you want true risk aversion, you need an independent third party on board at all times with authority to shut it down if things are outside safe operating parameters

4837 2018-07-26 14:32:37 Nonsense! With Alaskan production on the decline and demand for oil to Pacific North West refineries increasing, the real demand is in the Sumas line that crosses the border...not Westridge, for loading oil tankers to Asia.
4838 2018-07-26 14:32:34 In case you missed our description we examine Enviro groups not oil...When you want publicity and make a scene like these guys expect to be looked at. Plus whats the big deal...public should know about the connections.
4839 2018-07-26 14:32:34 The issues with E.M. denominated $ debt applying pressure upon trade, Asian GDP as rates climb. Capital flight across region regarding liquidity, inflation etc. ..

The PBOC is feeling pressure on many fronts because of strong $, reserve rates, oil.... draining $ liquidity.
4840 2018-07-26 14:32:25 Looks like it is trading in a narrow range for now....consolidating. Nothing to do here till it wakes up again.
4841 2018-07-26 14:32:00 When I said the neighbours brother, I meant that everyone and his cat knows someone who can get this oil, with higher or lower concentrations!
4842 2018-07-26 14:31:45 Yes RT @ASouthernJule: @ThickHERbell Speaking of, should I send you a cotton ball with oil on it? Taking one to my new office today!
4843 2018-07-26 14:31:44 Actually helpful tip number 3. If you have dry nail or want longer nails you can take Jojoba and vitamin E oil in a nail oil pen (I get mine from Amazon) the pen makes it easy to take your nail oil on the go. I learned this from @nailogical #lifehacks #beatyhack #nailoil
4844 2018-07-26 14:31:44 No, actually this is where Remainers misunderstand economics & economic cycles - & with ever little hiccup will shout 'Brexit did that!'  

The price of oil rose worldwide.  Inflation is up worldwide.  Countries go through economic cycles at different times.

Economics 101.
4845 2018-07-26 14:31:41 Yep, a gas company with a terrible oil spill record 
4846 2018-07-26 14:31:33 Hope it’s better than the shambolic XE. Mine due in garage yet again 6th Aug. I have no air con. Added to oil seals, diesel additive problems x 3, sensor problems, new DAB radio, AEB braking not working plus lots of other issues. 2 others I know same problems.

4848 2018-07-26 14:30:54 I have 85k miles on my 10’ Toy Corolla. It’s taken care of with regular synthetic oil changes and non abusive diving. How many miles can I put on this car before it’s no longer reliable?

4852 2018-07-26 14:30:43 My POV is for people to 1) make up their own minds, 2) look up the data for themselves since everyone has an agenda, and 3) ask a lot of questions of those trying to sell you snake oil, either from the union or the city.

4854 2018-07-26 14:30:26 So, when will you be releasing the findings that pure cannabis oil cures and prevents cancer??
4855 2018-07-26 14:30:26 I bot you think Bill Clinton is an angel and Hillary is a muse. You seem to be Russian to defend CNN’s yellow press. What’s actually happening around the world according to CNN. What about Iranian backed Houthi’s attacking Saudi oil tankers? Keep up with the latest outrage.
4856 2018-07-26 14:30:15 If you don’t already have one of these from another team and would like one, let me know. $20 and the free oil change alone more than covers that cost. BOGO at DQ & Bahama Bucks are great for families too.  Most coupons good and reusable all year.

Pake oil apa emang?
4862 2018-07-26 14:29:53 Did he bring any jobs with him ? Mmm a lawyer that knows the definition of the words "corruption conviction's " ?? Aaa maybe a oil tanker full of crude ?
4863 2018-07-26 14:29:47 And that means on top of the world wide increase in prices in oil in USD, and in addition to the lower growth in the UK meaning we all have less money in our pockets, because of Brexit.
4864 2018-07-26 14:29:40 But Scotland doesn't get its oil money Westminster does and the crumbs end up in Scotland!Could do tomorrow and And every year from now it will increase,you ignorance on these matters is sad,but usual for Brit nat schills!
4865 2018-07-26 14:29:37 hala oh, pa change oil na hahaha
4866 2018-07-26 14:29:24 National oil has renewed sponsorship deal with Malkia Striker  worth 42 million which will  run for three years.
4867 2018-07-26 14:29:21 rice in many forms (boiled, gruelled, paste), coconut in many forms (grated, milk, oil, chipped), and lots of local herbs and spices is the common factor between South Indian and Sri Lankan cuisines! Bon Apetit! :-)

Them oil money dudes paying big to do filthy things to women
4869 2018-07-26 14:29:12 We'll show him what "Christian love" is all about. PREPARE THE THUMB SCREWS, OIL THE RACK; WE WILL HAVE YOUR CONFESSION!!!
4870 2018-07-26 14:29:01 that article was an AMAZING piece and so well written, but jfc, yeah, everything is a circular scam with her.

only sociopaths can be serene selling snake oil.
4871 2018-07-26 14:28:49 Also, the money that went to Iran was always Iran’s but was held due to sanctions, which were removed when they signed the non-nuclear agreement & THEIR money was returned. It was NOT taxpayer money. Calling other people stupid is always rude, but worse when you’re incorrect.
4872 2018-07-26 14:28:44 I try to make a "salad" everyday of an avocado, a fruit, a tomato, mint, olive oil, himalayan sea salt, and goat cheese.
4873 2018-07-26 14:28:18 put some oil on your door frame and doorknob and pray that only good enters.
4874 2018-07-26 14:28:12 Queasy stomach? Try Peppermint Oil. I was feeling nauseas this morning and now I feel progressively better.
4875 2018-07-26 14:28:04 Have you tried both CBDand THC oil?
4876 2018-07-26 14:27:47 See this is why Brexiteers misunderstand the world, there are many entirely independent things that impact on the economy of each country, just because one isn't effecting Australia doesn't mean it doesn't effect the UK. Oil is traded in USD, weak pound = increased prices.
4877 2018-07-26 14:27:38 I love robotic oil poffins~!
4878 2018-07-26 14:27:32 Drumpf destabilization of oil producing regions. Drumpf backing off on #renewables. Bad policies supported by @GOP.
4879 2018-07-26 14:27:26 Oil spill smash mouth? You don’t mean that
4880 2018-07-26 14:27:23 Underground Natural Gas & Crude Oil run out in fifty years, why would you be exporting it instead of saving it for US future use? What happened to America First? @WhiteHouse @exxonmobil @Conoco @HouseFloor @SenateFloor @NatlGovsAssoc @usmayors @MSNBC @CNN @NewsHour @NCAA @algore
4881 2018-07-26 14:27:06 Really good advice. I just double-checked. Oil pan AND broken axle, so at least it wasn't driven dry. Must've been a hell of a pothole so I'll check the motor mounts. And suspension, of course. Anything else?
4882 2018-07-26 14:27:02 Government bond prices ended higher today on stabilising crude oil prices coupled with easing concerns over inflation heading higher. Strength in rupee versus US dollar, also supported prices.
4883 2018-07-26 14:27:01 Such LOVELY people aren't they  .... if you import shit - shit is what you'll get! Time to END this. Round them up NOW & send them back. Oil & water NEVER MIX!
4884 2018-07-26 14:26:46 I use a dry rub from the Oil Field Company my dad works for in California. I have not done the finishing vinegar/garlic but that sounds amazing. The biggest key is resting the meat!
4885 2018-07-26 14:26:43 How? Paper safety isn't real. "Thou shalt" means nothing when there's a million litres of oil in the water. Penalties don't revive dead marine life. The actions have to be in prevention. What would you change? We can say "It could be more", so how could it?
4886 2018-07-26 14:26:39 This last line has completely assuaged all my fears & I trust moderate Dems like Kurt Schrader implicitly: “That was probably his major concern, that it’s going to push us to do uncontrolled oil & gas exploration on public lands. & that’s not the case under the new bill.” 
4887 2018-07-26 14:26:37 Awwww wuuut, 100% dont rest until they fix it ( im guessing you served in the military) get your civi doc to challenge them, even to the point they pic up any tab for treatment. Have tried taking the likes of GSM or cod liver oil caps to see if can ease joint pain you have!?
4888 2018-07-26 14:26:35 What I'm against is, corporate welfare: oil subsidies, wars that enrich profiteers and make us less safe, tax havens for billionaires, trade deals that export good paying jobs, tax loopholes that let Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos pay no federal taxes and so on.
4889 2018-07-26 14:26:33 Having oil changed in truck 
Watching fake news , getting sick  wanting to puke  got up and walked around looking at trucks feel better now. LOL
4890 2018-07-26 14:26:33 It does. Simple stuff. 

Protein at every meal
Less sugar/ veg oil/ fried food

4897 2018-07-26 14:26:02 Lmfaoooooooooooooooo I'm gonna call u in a few Jamie's getting his oil changed rn
4898 2018-07-26 14:25:52 Hey, it has protein (eggs), fats (oil), and only a metric ton of sugar...
4899 2018-07-26 14:25:51 I respect your opinion and the desire but imo it's not based in reality.  oil and gas is not just refineries, there is an entire support network that supports it. ur thinking is moving the tip of a pyramid will move the entire structure.
4900 2018-07-26 14:25:44 Lol oil na oil, you try crude oil too.
4901 2018-07-26 14:25:42 It worked for me but everyones skin is different. Also maybe try using a gentle cleanser when you wash your face so you don't strip your oils. Your face will create more oil to compensate for what it feels like it lost
4902 2018-07-26 14:25:37 Just had a very sad garlic bread, it was bad flatbread brushed with olive oil and garlic, with rocket on top and some cheap cheese, vey disappointed, I deserve more
4903 2018-07-26 14:25:37 Lookout Iowa & Illinois here comes the “Twatwaffle, smuzing, snake oil, traitorous Trump. He will pit steel against farmers, citizen against citizen to achieve his nefarious schemes, chaos reigns in the country. Is this the #MAGA you signed onto? #MAGA? I don’t think so.
4904 2018-07-26 14:25:31 Whataboutism, especially one as profoundly incorrect as this one, isn’t going to change the fact that due to Trump’s trade war, the taxpayers are having to bail out an entire industry & many more are failing.
4905 2018-07-26 14:25:21 even just a teaspoon of olive oil over his food could help
4906 2018-07-26 14:25:20 $COP .. oil names should do great tomorrow

Click my story and ask away!
4916 2018-07-26 14:23:58 I worked at a movie theatre as a kid. That's where I learned about making popcorn with a disgusting amount a viscous amber mystery oil. Lots of oil is the only way. Nice to see the method going mainstream.
4917 2018-07-26 14:23:40 Better take that shit to Walmart or pep boys you only need dealership oil changes for foreigns
4918 2018-07-26 14:23:38 Did you even go to school? Modern wildlife and plant life doesn't produce enough fossil fuels to maintain humanity. Underground Oil & Natural gas runs out in fifty years, per universal studies.
4919 2018-07-26 14:23:35 Oil prices are up to the public is learning even more killing!
4920 2018-07-26 14:23:32 I need to try this oil. Sound interesting? Ask me how to order.

4923 2018-07-26 14:23:06 What do you predict more. As pland by Iran ,today’s attack on two Bahri Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCCs) transporting crude oil, is only symptoms for worse

4929 2018-07-26 14:21:56 And if #Trump had to protect the oil industry with tariffs, you would still bitch about it.
4930 2018-07-26 14:21:37 love too be held hostage by congressmen from Dry Asse, Texas (R - Big Oil)

4935 2018-07-26 14:20:55 Except this article is BS -- Pipeline was already approved before it was bought by the Canadian govt - reality is the USA is working hard to find a solution to reduce the need for Canadian heavy oil because the pipeline was not built,
4936 2018-07-26 14:20:51 $20-$30 for me to change my own oil or $45-65 for me to go to a shop 
4937 2018-07-26 14:20:51 And going after the Russian oil pipeline to Russia (being used by Germany).
4938 2018-07-26 14:20:50 Tell Kelly a person can buy thus thing called Sweet Oil it’s good got Earaches also. It has Olive Oil in it to.
4939 2018-07-26 14:20:37 Came to get an oil change with a whole coupon & they still got me to not use it & pay more. Smh.
4940 2018-07-26 14:20:30 This is BS, based on a totally false premise - namely that #Trump wants a deal with #Iran better than the current one. He doesn't, & never has done. He wants war with Iran, because he wants to get his filthy hands on Iran's oil & gas, & he wants to destroy the #Iranian #Regime.
4941 2018-07-26 14:20:26 :) i think that is the software equivalent of I never want an oil change
4942 2018-07-26 14:20:21 Show us don’t tell us ! What happened with your oil story ? What happened with your bankrupt companies ? Economic mismanagement

4944 2018-07-26 14:20:07 Most Big media control led by biggest business on which a lenattu of about 4 million is levied by presentis   GOI for drawing oil/ gas  illegally in KG basin. So, their grouse n media hate is obvious.
4945 2018-07-26 14:20:05 I have heard that Mussolini was force fed castor oil (an extremely powerful laxative) and hung upside down? That is a far worse and ignominious end than being shot.
4946 2018-07-26 14:19:44 If you see the map, you would notice that katsina is the closest state to Niger. This means shorter pipeline investment. The refinery will be private driven so the deal is that they get oil from Nigeria and Niger. Sell the product to Niger and Nigeria but are taxed by Nigeria.
4947 2018-07-26 14:19:43 Always great when you go in for an oil change and your mechanic finds $500 worth of fixes that need to be made to your car. I hate being grown up. #dontdoit

4949 2018-07-26 14:19:07 I honestly don’t know why girls use mascara when organic castor oil works better and grows your lashes, instead of potentially ripping them off, at the same time……
4950 2018-07-26 14:19:03 If money wasn't real you would be allocated all the things you buy now and most surely in much more sparce ration.

No I agree capitalism has many problems, with war, oil and greed but sadly those things in some form would still be there. Post scarcity is wonderful but it costs.
4951 2018-07-26 14:18:58 Change Of Oil...
4952 2018-07-26 14:18:21 Just as well they didn't discover oil on Mars ... It's days as an independent planet would be numbered. Would be interesting though to see what the Martian version of Ruth and the Mundell's would look like.
4953 2018-07-26 14:18:19 Trump armed the Ukraine, attacked the Russian economy by selling oil/LNG in Europe,sanctioned Putin's oligarchs, had Mattis annihilate Russian mercenaries in Syria and rebuked Merkle for buying 35% of their energy from Russia. But keep falling for the leftist bullshit propaganda.

4957 2018-07-26 14:17:36 I'm skeptical that the title issues are from anything so minor. Unless after the oil pan was damaged it was driven, at all. If so, the motor is on borrowed time. 

Have the compression checked. Drain some oil and look for metal. But how to know the condition of the main bearings?
4958 2018-07-26 14:17:33 In the waiting room for oil change. Two people are reading paper newspapers, one woman is writing in a lovely journal, and one young man is reading a thick book. I’m the only one staring at a screen.

4964 2018-07-26 14:16:38 Just keep them away from (s)hemp oil
4965 2018-07-26 14:16:37 Unfortunately they didn’t learn how to do the work before they nationalized the oil and took it away from the oil companies.
4966 2018-07-26 14:16:34 So when Trump visits farmers in Iowa in about an hour will they follow his instructions to the VFW that “what you hear is not real and what you see is not really happening?”  Seems like that’s important because, you know, reality or not, trust or suspend belief. Snake oil sales.

4968 2018-07-26 14:16:28 Hannity is nothing more than a modern day glorified Snake Oil Salesman... don’t validate his behavior by going in his show. He is the epitome of #FakeNews

4972 2018-07-26 14:15:48 Hey Liz remember when your dad was sec of defense and said we must defeat Iran in Kuwait because of freedom when it was for oil, or when he was the vice pres and said we have to defeat Iraq because WMD's that they stockpiled, which of course they had none. Talk about that Liz
4973 2018-07-26 14:15:43 Lol you lot are talking blindly.. Why have a refinery to refine Niger's oil, this is a joint agreement to set up the refinery, we get to refine our oil also and theirs and still sell back the products to them at a reasonable but profitable rate.. Why that state was chosen;

4976 2018-07-26 14:15:18 Just about anything could be a store of value if it is useful. 

Boxes of ammunition have a long track record of holding value, especially when times get tough. 

Oil and bullets both have uses. 

After almost ten years #bitcoin has failed to prove its usefulness.
4977 2018-07-26 14:15:14 Sitting in the lobby during an oil change rlly be the most uncomfortable shit
4978 2018-07-26 14:15:13 I cant find it on the internet. Ill use my tea tree oil and honey on them for a bit. Both are anti fingal and stuff. But if its internal itl keep coming back. Not itchy. Not discolored. Just scaly bumps. Anyway, howd u sleep
4979 2018-07-26 14:15:08 The former. Keep it in the fridge, covered in oil. Pull one out, chop it, and throw it in the saute or whatever. The remaining oil is great for vinaigrette or sauteing.
4980 2018-07-26 14:15:06 Don't underestimate the redoubtable Iowan & the farmers. People know a snake oil salesperson, and you're it. They may be quiet, but it'll show in November.

4986 2018-07-26 14:14:20 We've not refined our very own local OIL... 
It's the one from Niger that we'd then refine..

This is one of the economic recovery developmental plans of this government... 

We've refineries  but only talking about just one. 
They rest are not working properly. 

So sad...
4987 2018-07-26 14:14:13 Heres another big thought related to #FACEBOOK:  
This story is actually about standards of investor disclosure (or lack thereof). Investors should demand more transparency from public boards about how they manage data. Especially if we all agree that data is the new oil.  @cnbc

5020 2018-07-26 14:10:26 The oil curve is inverted; which people believe means that crude demand will be low/ Supplies high in the future. This hurts E&P stocks as investors are always looking for “growth”. This is silly, you can’t predict the future. The curve indicates that E&Ps are hedging. THATS ALL

5035 2018-07-26 14:08:18 Olives are ​pressed​ for oil, fruits are ​squeezed​ for juice, flowers are ​crushed​ for perfume. These painful processes give value. So when you feel ​crushed, squeezed and pressed​, you are getting more value. So have strong faith in God. He refines those he loves. Stay humble

5056 2018-07-26 14:05:34 Out deal was a flat $20K installation. So that's around 10 years ROI assuming all the existing equipment would last that long. It was a 25 year old furnace, and the oil tank would definitely need replacing in that window. So much less than 10 years if we had to do those.

5105 2018-07-26 13:59:47 I intensely dislike cooked kale, unless it’s crisp kale chips broiled with oil and cayenne pepper. 
I think I’d like to skip breakfast and have lunch.
5106 2018-07-26 13:59:46 I mean folks in the UK happy to protest the POTUS for his apparently being a racist but cannabis is still ban in the UK for a racist reason ! Look in to pure cannabis oil it show promise if being a super cancer cure even those the medical profession have deemed to far gone !

5109 2018-07-26 13:59:13 Could capitalism be the solution?  As Asia and Africa continue to adopt the economic best practice of capitalism, they will become more environmentally capable, similar to American oil drilling, which is the most environmentally protective in the world.

5115 2018-07-26 13:58:19 @SrBachchan once you advertise to buy jewelry from Mehtab then pledge it in Muthoot & then apply Navranatan oil, what crazy stuff you're doing take retirement you have sold your soul the same way like our politicians
5116 2018-07-26 13:58:19 today @ gg with carlos:

: tulog kasi ang oil
c: oh... *touches the other* but all of them are sleeping
5117 2018-07-26 13:58:10 I agree with the message that there may be something important about eating the whole fish rather than just the oil too..

I want to negotiate the price of the car. 

No.

Okay well I would like to knock off a point on the interest rate

No.

Then throw in a free warranty?

No, but how about we give you a free oil change?

Deal!!

5123 2018-07-26 13:57:16 Nigeria is a failed nation, 80% of the states are dependent on the FG, majority of the northern states aren’t close to civilization, Nigeria as a nation was overly dependent on oil till the prices crashed. How won’t there be crisis?

5132 2018-07-26 13:56:18 I’m not hating on Brendan, I’m saying he was holding a bottle of the oil because of product placement and I felt bad for him. Unless I’m misunderstanding what you’re saying? I love the show too, especially the positive vibe and support and I’m a little upset that you’re so upset.

5139 2018-07-26 13:55:24 This girl is about to learn how to change my on dang oil. This shit is ridiculous 
5140 2018-07-26 13:55:19 I've managed to spill lavender essential oil all over myself so I'm just going to smell like your nan for the next few years, if you don't mind.
5141 2018-07-26 13:55:16 Is God's will really murder flooding the streets?
Can we measure her love by the oil underneath?

5146 2018-07-26 13:54:42 Head gasket will do that. Make it run way hot, white smoke from exhaust, really rough idle if at all. No power to speak of. Oil light, check engine light, others will go at the same time.
5147 2018-07-26 13:54:38 Meanwhile, I just paid &4.08 a gallon for a home delivery of oil! Wtf? Wow! #FucktRUmp

5149 2018-07-26 13:54:28 1 of 2  People benefit tremendously from CBD oil, without causing any harm, so how can the federal government in the United States justify keeping it from people? This is precisely why so many of us have begun rejecting the power of the government.

5152 2018-07-26 13:54:15 Oil change every 6 months, and brake pads like once a year. Also dodrive smoothly while in traffic. Reduces the stress on your car parts. But those miles do rack up quickly
5153 2018-07-26 13:54:09 It’s also peace the mind put lil lavender oil in there..
5154 2018-07-26 13:54:08 HEY MEN. Do mechanics try to sell you a new air filter every single time you get your oil changed or is this just a special game they play with me?
5155 2018-07-26 13:54:05 Fortunately, we still have that opportunity with a number of new oil fields now in early development.

5159 2018-07-26 13:53:55 Unfortunately utilities in Japan had to ramp up thermal generations especially gas and oil to meet the high power demand because of the heat. Surely we need to think what to do for climate change risk. #TCFD could be one answer.

5164 2018-07-26 13:53:17 Intelligence is one thing, intention another. Politicians look more at the immediate and the next term. Oil and gas was vital for Labour and Conservative governments and so losing control of Scotland was out of the question
5165 2018-07-26 13:53:11 Assuming that they used olive oil, and not say canola oil.
5166 2018-07-26 13:53:02 Yes, and it only took $2000 of gasoline to drive around and collect all those cans.   Its a win-win for aluminum workers and oil workers.

5169 2018-07-26 13:52:33 Louisiana KNOWS their own state is losing land to higher rising gulf waters, they’ve lost a good chunk of gulf-seafood due to oil spills, and they’ve already seen what a bad hurricane can do to their environment......and they’re still looking in the wrong direction for answers.
5170 2018-07-26 13:52:13 That is why you republicans back coal and oil which are dirty and pollute and are antiquated. Its time to look to the future, Hydrogen, Solar and other forms of energy that are both renewable and safe for both the planet and for humans.
5171 2018-07-26 13:52:10 Also. Search facial massage on YouTube and use an oil or serum and follow along with the massage while listening to the frequency.

5178 2018-07-26 13:51:07 Dear Behar, Norway is not a true  socialist country. So called free health care cost citizens 2000 per year as there part of the contribution. Oil, which Venezuela also has plenty of, pays for most of it. It is not being used to make the politicians wealthy.

5185 2018-07-26 13:50:12 So djt is looking at the Alaskan wildlife refuge for oil, looks like he wants to screw up everything. Leave that beautiful place alone.
5186 2018-07-26 13:50:07 Although oil, not attention or data, is what fuels airports at all! And this is more than just an ironic aside, I think.
5187 2018-07-26 13:50:05 @CIA If you take on Iran you will be taking on China and probably Russia as well...Iran is like the Chinese private gas pump. they know losing Iran's oil puts them in a real bad spot...
5188 2018-07-26 13:50:00 , some days I’d love the oil
5189 2018-07-26 13:49:42 we need to have a debate regarding AI, population collapse in the 22nd century and the fall of Europe and USA as main financial capitals. The plus side is that I won't be around but Ellie its your time. The world is headed for great changes, water will be the new oil for a start.
5190 2018-07-26 13:49:40 I much prefer glass. Not keen on plastic packaging at and it drives me nuts that people such as @Bertolli are using plastic bottles for oil which imho is not ideal.

5192 2018-07-26 13:49:26 I think that's the 3.5 L V-6. Sounds like a head gasket failed. Check the oil dipstick for any water. If there is water, it's a pain but it is salvageable. Unless there was rod knock going on, it's probably just the gasket.
5193 2018-07-26 13:49:25 What do I look like changing the tire, oil, battery, cooking, cleaning etc. When you can't bring any of that to the table?? No.

5202 2018-07-26 13:48:36 I love vetiver. I diffuse it for sleep. In case no one has told you, vetiver is very thick. Probably the thickest of any essential oil. It takes patience to get it out of the bottle. But it is so worth it!

5211 2018-07-26 13:47:44 Your statement is factually accurate. You are still misleading people by implying that fossil fuels are a good thing. 

We still need to move past them. You are an #astroturfing campaign to protect the oil and gas industries

5213 2018-07-26 13:47:33 It appears this administration (promising smaller gov) is indeed taking more control our lives than ever before.

5214 2018-07-26 13:47:30 It isn't to say that Russia meddled, but at the same time we meddle in damn near every democratic election that's actually the reason why Venezuela is in a civil war because we want to overthrow their government as well because they are sitting on a stockpile of oil as well

BUILD WALL!!!!
5236 2018-07-26 13:45:15 It's not a ridiculous idea. Matthew Crawford's idea that we need to reclaim 'the attentional commons' is politically generative (attention, not data, is 'the new oil'; most social and ecological crises are commons problems) and he uses airport distractions as his main example.
5237 2018-07-26 13:44:38 Germany is doing an oil deal with Russia.  Is that choosing enemies over allies? Don't conflate trade issues with American support of our allies.
5238 2018-07-26 13:44:38 My brother-in-law, before he passed this year, had dementia and Parkinson's.  If I could have given him weed to help him out in the least bit, you bet your bottom dollar I would have done it.  But it's still illegal here in Indiana.  They just passed cannabis oil this year.

5261 2018-07-26 13:42:19 But they're not balancing risk. They're increasing risk. Oil by rail 4 x more likely to spill. American, Saudi etc tankers with substandard safety regulations in equipment (ships), supervision (tugs) and off load. It's purely politics with not even a nod to safety.

5276 2018-07-26 13:40:13 Urban drilling is not a new practice nationwide, nor in and around Northern CO. The Beverly Hills High School has had an active oil derrick on its campus for decades.

5278 2018-07-26 13:40:00 The issue was compounded when Chavez gave away tons of Oil as gifts and crippled our production company to only have "loyal employees"(doesn't that sound familiar), and the current admin doesn't want to correct course, cuz that would be admitting they were wrong.
5279 2018-07-26 13:39:54 There isn't a single person on planet earth who have "hardly benefited from oil". Billions have been lifted out of extreme poverty. There's lots of talk of "rising sea levels" but the data show small, incremental changes that have been occurring for 100s of years.

5286 2018-07-26 13:38:59 Wtf are you even babbling about? After WW2, Israel was positioned to be a key geopolitical asset in the protection & transporting of the US’s theft of M.E. oil. It’s why we gave them nukes & continue to fund them. The US wouldn’t give two shits about Israel’s survival otherwise.

5292 2018-07-26 13:38:24 The fire team leader said ''When they exploded, each 220kg bomb quashed the flames for a radius of up to 100m. the shockwaves simply blew out the flames in the same way our breath  does to candles. And such an explosive technique is already in use to  douse fires in oil wells''
5293 2018-07-26 13:38:13 If what you must apply on your SKIN, is not "eatable" then DON'T USE IT ON THE SKIN. The skin, is the largest organ of the human body. You better use ANY VEGETABLE OIL, available right in your kitchen; cocoa, olive, coconut oil, etc, etc. I do believe ALL FDA's will take note.
5294 2018-07-26 13:38:10 Venezuelan here, it's not that simple. The problem (besides various sanctions and stuff) is that Oil actually has been more of a detriment to Venezuela than a boon. Governments spend all the money they can while the price is high, and don't save for a rainy day.

5298 2018-07-26 13:37:44 The obvious potential consequences for a reestablished Scottish State following a YES vote on 18/09/2014 are somewhat obvious.

5347 2018-07-26 13:32:03 These policies that she is pushing are successful all over the world. The current regime in Venezuela overthrew a much worse one and helped lift millions out of poverty by nationalizing the oil industry. It’s doing so bad because of low oil prices not because of socialism.

5371 2018-07-26 13:29:27 So Newfoundland is still in the oil business, eh? Good to see more jobs coming, but it’s a shame no one will be able to afford to live here soon.
5372 2018-07-26 13:29:25 I hope there isn't a penalty clause for the government being unable to provide security as if there was we should get ready to pay another hefty fine. 

How we got cattle rustlers to negotiate oil deals still baffles me, expect increased insecurity & possible cessation talk.
5373 2018-07-26 13:29:24 Yes! I think that is spot on about the symbolism of the cloud... and yeah, you'll quickly realise how non-virtual the virtual is when we run out of oil boys.
5374 2018-07-26 13:29:23 Blah blah blah.  Useless. Still don’t get it.  It’s not all about oil and until you get that we’re still in trouble.
5375 2018-07-26 13:29:20 A dollop? Is it whipped aerated coconut oil?
5376 2018-07-26 13:29:19 So our borders are not open, 'open borders' is phrase used by snake oil sales men and like 99% of everything else they bang on about it's a load of bollocks that tickles the fancys of xenophobes.
5377 2018-07-26 13:29:16 #RT @SexAdviceBot: Don't forget to always use massage oil before, during, and after sex!
5378 2018-07-26 13:29:14 That was a posh skip! The stench of patchouli oil from the Cockburn Street market hippies could knock you out.
5379 2018-07-26 13:29:04 Not everyday eating tasteful meals. Coconut oil might have been prescribed by a dietician uno
5380 2018-07-26 13:28:38 For me it’s anti-vaxxers and essential oil salespeople I gotta avoid

5385 2018-07-26 13:28:06 Coconut oil is great!

Coconut oil is a medium chain triglyceride that has many health benefits.  Unlike many other fats, it is is more easily  metabolized to provide quick energy.
5386 2018-07-26 13:28:06 Yaas with the castor oil

5388 2018-07-26 13:27:50 Too loosen up those stubborn bolts and nuts Alex use a penetrating oil spray like PB Blaster or liquid wrench, wd40 and let it sit for a few minutes. Really helps!
5389 2018-07-26 13:27:48 And I thought my oil change was pricey lmaooo
5390 2018-07-26 13:27:47 You just figured? It’s the biggest industry, bigger than oil.

5393 2018-07-26 13:27:34 In ten years, the New England Journal of Medicine will report that coconut oil is harmful and should be avoided at all costs.

5395 2018-07-26 13:27:33 #GIPCYEF2018 Interesting how all our local Agricultural Products have local names. We may have to rethink our branding to give it a more global interface!My take though. @KojoAB @gipcghana
5396 2018-07-26 13:27:26 This ‘capitalist caused oil price crash’ sounds interesting.

5401 2018-07-26 13:26:55 Yea, I'm sure Russia/Putin are real happy about the EU agreeing to buy natural gas and oil from US tariff free instead of from them. Just like they were thrilled about trump increasing NATO defense spending, and trump kicking their ambassadors out of the US. Actions > words

5406 2018-07-26 13:26:31 Political convenience is always inconvenient for the public these politicos like saying they serve.

It has become so normal to see just how bold these horse-traders have become. They've expanded their business to selling snake oil.

Such a waste of taxpayer pesos.

5417 2018-07-26 13:25:50 Vaping is fine as a weening tool, but I’m directing my angst at people who think it’s healthier and cooler and that it’s “not smoking.” And that they think they’re better than me for doing it. The obnoxious vaping selfie people. I have vaped before too, but it was oil.
5418 2018-07-26 13:25:46 If $FB crashes 21% overnight... imagine how $TSLA stock will perform if all chronic buyers will have to surrender. The tech sector desperately needs strong $amzn earnings tonight. $spy
5419 2018-07-26 13:25:44 That’s part of the issue, in today’s evolving society you have to adapt, Trump supporters don’t like that. Coal miners wanted coal back rather than reskill. They bought the snake oil despite the warning label

5425 2018-07-26 13:24:47 And all those Scandinavian Kingdoms broke the UN embargo against Apartheid South Africa for years too and made millions. Norway is an oil producer. And none of them has ever been a socialist economy like Venezuela. Compare the Kingdom of Norway with Venezuela.

5437 2018-07-26 13:23:33 They are not really warehouses but where the oil are processed. Benue and kogi have them in surplus. The crayfish i can get them from Akwa Ibom and Cross River state they are really cheap over there. I reside in Abuja

5440 2018-07-26 13:22:46 Yes, this is going to be costly (selling oil at a discount, insuring etc.), but bottom line is that when comparing revenues from the "low oil price environment" a couple of years ago, with that of a reduction in 25% of exports, things don't look that bad in terms of revenues...
5441 2018-07-26 13:22:42 the governments, county and national, should tread fast and careful to solve this before a militia germinate that would see the region join the likes of Libya and Middle East oil calamities
5442 2018-07-26 13:22:41 Baaaas that is why. Only visit shell for fuel and to wipe yiur windows. Everything else go to any total. Their prices are friendly for coolant, engine oil, etc.
5443 2018-07-26 13:22:36 This morning I am working from the tire shop's waiting room while I get new tires and an oil change. TV is tuned to a judge show with TWO JUDGES. It's called "Couples Court." The judges just ordered a lie-detector test on one of the participants.

5445 2018-07-26 13:22:21  I have 4b/c hair and I use the olive oil eco. I just spray a lil water, add the gel, then tie it down with a scarf and don’t remove the scarf until it’s dry. Then my edges stay down all day but if I need reinforcement I’ll add an edge control on top. Try that
5446 2018-07-26 13:22:15 you forgot triffids, zombies and the kraken
5447 2018-07-26 13:22:05 You might be interested in Matless, Landscape and Englishness.

5452 2018-07-26 13:21:01 It amazes me how many people worry themselves sick about oil and gas jobs but care nothing about green jobs.  It amazes me how many people can't understand wanting cleaner air for future generations. #onpoli

5455 2018-07-26 13:20:43 Also, never pour hot cooking oil into a plastic bowl. That was a "note to self" I didn't even need to write down. It was immediately and irrevocably seared into my memory.
5456 2018-07-26 13:20:35 And when you condition make sure you massage your scalp, that's where the hair grows from and massage promotes healthy blood flow to the follicle. Also, try adding a bit of cinnamon essential oil to your shampoo and conditioner to stimulate further!

5459 2018-07-26 13:20:27 Have u tried shea butter? Oil just traps moisture under your skin. Also, drink more water. 
5460 2018-07-26 13:20:08 Good, its just to bad it's taken this long for people to see what she did to them! She punished the people of Oklahoma because the oil & gas co. Instead of investing in clean energy like other states, she sat on her hands!
5461 2018-07-26 13:20:00 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
5462 2018-07-26 13:19:57 Then WHY are you subsidizing FARMERS, pharmaceutical companies and oil companies with OUR tax money?
5463 2018-07-26 13:19:56 The principle is sound - oil well fires have been put out with high explosives for a long time. Fire on a bombing range though? Yeesh

5465 2018-07-26 13:19:39 One of the major weapons in the war on cancer, which most people don't know about, is Cannabidiol, (CBD oil) derived from industrial hemp and marijuana. The aging Baby Boomer population is a major largely untapped market for this cancer fighting remedy, which is not FDA approved.

5477 2018-07-26 13:18:33 12 Billion with a B is no comparison to the 150 Billion with a B, and that was Cash that Obama gave to Iran.  Yes, you all have a problem with Trump helping Americans but are fine with giving it to other countries.  Yes, you’re a special kind of stupid.
5478 2018-07-26 13:18:24 Iirc Gadaffi layed out a secular version of Pan-Arabism in his "Green Book" among other things. Another nail for his coffin. Trying to create a gold-backed currency and wanting to deal oil in Euro instead of Petrodollar finally did him in.

5484 2018-07-26 13:17:28 This happens when Socialists take control.  The South American nation's economy has been steadily collapsing since the crash of oil prices in 2014 left it unable to maintain a socialist system of subsidies and price controls.

5517 2018-07-26 13:14:35 What are some alternatives that might work? What is a viable theory of change and robust strategy for decoupling deforestation from commodities (soy, beef, palm oil and pulp are responsible for 70% of deforestation). What is flawed with market-based mechanisms that we could fix?

5644 2018-07-26 13:01:51 It is not about the purity of the product... this has to do with the efficiency of palm oil production. If you outright ban palm oil, then businesses will use another crop, for example soya oil. By doing so they can deforest up to 4x more forests... do you know what I am saying?

5772 2018-07-26 12:50:05 QC economy is largely based on water, from hydro to fisheries to tourism to transport.

Albertans literally cannot imagine  a water-based economy.  It's a weakness - they think oil is an economic driver, but it's not.

Water is an investment.
Oil is speculation.

5776 2018-07-26 12:49:49 Don’t forget that rubber and oil will have been deposited on the road surface too. Add water to make the road surface as slippery as ice. Take particular care at roundabouts where there is a filling station as fuel often gets spilt there.

5790 2018-07-26 12:47:31 lol wow would be nice if our govt cared equally about "certainty" and "predictability" as it did about protecting our fishery through strict environmental regulations as we let an oil company pursue DEEP ocean drilling in our incredibly imp and at risk ocean ecosystem

5799 2018-07-26 12:46:53 Tom, I just base it on the fact that oil companies don't generally fail, and won't invest $11B in something unless their experts say it will succeed.  10% of a lot of money is still a lot of money.  I hate this gov but applaud this deal.

5830 2018-07-26 12:42:56 How many oil companies without debts with 5 mil cash reporting revenue?
5831 2018-07-26 12:42:51 Because we shouldn't be tying the provinces revenue to oil prices any more than we have to.  It's already way too volatile.

I have one question 
If compressed nitrogen gas leaks into hydraulic oil, it react and cause water in oil or no? Because always we found water in oil although there are NO heat, cooling water or any other extrnal source.
Thanks alot

5864 2018-07-26 12:39:14 I hope so! We have to vote as a tsunami to overpower the rural vote. There are a lot of ranch, evangelical white, and oil votes to overcome. Urban turnout will be critical.
5865 2018-07-26 12:39:05 And it might wake up English people to the fact that Westminster does not work for them either.

6062 2018-07-26 12:14:36 On the interweb people have been promoting cognitive benefits of fish oil supplements especially after trauma. I am assuming the claimed health mechanism would be similar so probably no benefit?

6108 2018-07-26 12:08:44 The gas and oil industry is subsidized with about 4B$ of tax payer money every year. Unlike the farmers they make billions in profits but nobody cares about that.
6109 2018-07-26 12:08:26 You'd have thought the billionaire oil oligarchs might've given it away but dude does work for a company founded by a white nationalist so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
6110 2018-07-26 12:08:13 Bobby - prices of fuel, food & travel are up across Europe due to the increase in the price of oil. The Pound was the most overvalued currency in the world, with the IMF etc. calling for it's devaluation for many years.

6334 2018-07-26 11:39:05 Further to this, the projected budget forecast from John Swinney prior to the 2014 referendum did not include oil revenue, it was viewed as an extra.

6338 2018-07-26 11:38:38 Why are so many of these so called vegans still eating soya and palm oil. Ok the vegan society states it's vegan but the actions and consequences of growing said items are catastrophic to much of the area and wildlife which they are grown in and what they are grown for. Wake up
6339 2018-07-26 11:38:35 What I really find it odd is that all cultures around the globe has traditions that might be viewed as “bizarre” or “weird” by Westerners. Why they only attack Middle Eastern culture?! Um wealth? Oil? I dont know!!

6348 2018-07-26 11:37:29 Exactly. Not only that, the bailout will only help w/crop losses. Won't offset losses on higher prices of farm equipment due to steel tariffs or rising oil costs due to his childish antics w/Iran.

Hi. Great job on the river bike. Suggestion: Most significant method to get rid of plastic is to accelerate d adoption of 100% EV vehicles because plastic is a by product of oil. It has to be cut from the root. @Tesla @elonmusk @Toyota @Honda God bless, Proverbs 31

6436 2018-07-26 11:25:09 There has been a lot of significant changes in the management of state oil company Sonangol. Anticipated changes in policy by the new government could also slow the pace of new investment that are needed to keep production steady. #Angola #africachat

6905 2018-07-26 10:13:41 Yeah i agree that Ph is for oil and gas. But um there are now so many tank farms in Apapa. And i know that they moved most of the tank fams here because of the time of militancy.

Nigeria had only $29bn, not even up to the 30bn Algeria spent. 

Venezuela only had just $10bn and massive corruption

7184 2018-07-26 09:25:38 I find it heartbreaking to be honest. People seem to have some kind of fantasy about loving this country, but it's just NOT LOVE when the government sneak through parliament the approval of breaking the bones of the earth for scrapings of oil & gas. It's violence to our homeland.

7456 2018-07-26 08:36:16 Have a just listened to an item about stockpiling olive oil and capers on the BBC? All a huge joke of course.
7457 2018-07-26 08:36:03 Idk how y’all paint like oil I have such a hard time keeping anything out of place
7458 2018-07-26 08:36:01 unilateral US sanctions always failed everywhere. sanctions on Iran and N.K succeded partially because they were multilateral.If US doesnt want to sell oil to NK,China and Russia will!!!

7468 2018-07-26 08:34:00 But who is benefiting from this attack?
The majority of Saudi’s oil is going to Europe and US via Suez. Two scenarios: first, Iran doing what they threatened to do “disrupt oil exportation if their oil sanctions take place again. Second, it is an “own goal” to rationalize the war
7469 2018-07-26 08:33:57 So bad that these people are building refinary in a state that has no crude oil. What stops them to build this where the raw material is been located to avoid spending on the cost of transportation.
Hatred won't allow Nigeria progress!!!

7490 2018-07-26 08:30:08 self serving,allowing Westminster to take 92% of scots oil and gas revenues for nearly 50 years is hardly self serving on the part of Scotland is it?
7491 2018-07-26 08:30:06 (4/5)Since the refractive indices of oil and paper are almost the same, refraction and scattering are reduced,

Otherwise we would end Pkk. ISIS oil is sold to Asad, Pyd, Barzani... Not Erdogan, it is a lie. Black propaganda to corner Turkey

7609 2018-07-26 08:04:40 Mayonnaise is an emulsion of eggs, oil, and an acid, usually vinegar or lemon.
Ice cream is a frozen custard: an emulsion of eggs, cream, and sugar.
Ergo, if you're eating lemon ice cream, you're basically eating frozen mayonnaise. ;)

7660 2018-07-26 07:55:18 Completely agree with this. It can feel like turning an oil tanker at times!
7661 2018-07-26 07:55:08 Fracking will bridge the gap as oil is depleted & help fund investment in renewables. It will protect the economy essential for investment in public services. The list goes on. Most protesters are hypocrites. They all have price. Offer them a million each and they soon melt away.
7662 2018-07-26 07:54:08 How can Trump expect respect since he never gives it. If he didnt want questions he should have just stayed a sleazy snake oil salesmen

7665 2018-07-26 07:53:33 Most super funds allow you to choose your mix of investments. Either way, every investment is investing in oil, coal. The ACF itself flies all over the country/world, drives petrol cars, uses coal electricity, uses goods made with coal electricity, eats food oil produced!

7671 2018-07-26 07:52:01 Debt-cutting time for big oil, as the cash flows. Shell took $4bn off its net debt in the the second quarter; Repsol took €4.1bn off its net debt in the same time
7672 2018-07-26 07:51:40 I'm confused - one minute there is no investment in the oil industry and now it is going great?  Make your mind up :-)

7691 2018-07-26 07:46:17 If that is the case return our Oil and Gas and let us ran the Oil and Gas sector. It is obvious you Malayan is incompetent. Legally the Oil and Gas belong to Sabah and Sarawak. As far as we are concern Azmin is giving the same answer as Petronas.

7706 2018-07-26 07:43:38 The oil industry have done great.  The missing billions ended up in the pockets of the rich. Either speculators or via the tax cuts. The country hasn't benefited like it could have done.

7709 2018-07-26 07:42:44 You can’t change Corbyn’s views on Jews. Labour and money are like oil and water. That’s against Jewish ideology. Jewish are smart and talented, great for capitalism.

With the places I've been through, for me, no sars anymore. "Most" atimes we Nigerians like to form strong head, that's one problem too.
7723 2018-07-26 07:39:51 You think they will do something? 

They will only come to protect our oil to do direct shipping to their country especially now that oil price is affecting their economy.

7740 2018-07-26 07:34:57 That’s one of the healthiest oils to order but sadly, despite being a Bengali, I don’t do fish, especially the heart-healthy ones. I source my fish oil from more palatable capsules.

7745 2018-07-26 07:34:37 How exactly does building a new pipeline to move AB oil to paying customers fail Canada? More Peter Mackay bullshit. That’s quite rich for the guy who personally killed the original Conservative Party in favour of Reform.
7746 2018-07-26 07:34:36 Here's what I don't get: if the packaging says contains soy,or canola or Palm oil then why use Palm is canola or soy can be used? There are a lot of soybean farmers in the States. Teach people how to grow soybeans.
7747 2018-07-26 07:34:29 Lots of oil.

7756 2018-07-26 07:33:29 You shouldn't be surprised. Apart from oil (obviously), military hardware and cybercrime, what does Russia actually produce?
7757 2018-07-26 07:33:07 Had me Cod Liver Oil pills,i'm slipping along nicely! 
7758 2018-07-26 07:33:00 OIL OIL OIL. って描いたらサザエさんぽく聞こえるは草
7759 2018-07-26 07:32:59 LOL - after kedpo bubbles the oil for a bit he is incredibly crunchy......
7760 2018-07-26 07:32:59 I have to get my oil changed at 7:30 am. Why, oh why, did I decide to get insomnia today.
7761 2018-07-26 07:32:51 Chéri, you are so in fire everything burns! Why do you need oil on a cooker for popcorn anyway? Just touch it. Do you eat your pop corn with chili pepper taste? 
7762 2018-07-26 07:32:44 Oh please.  Stop this #hypocrisy and open your eyes, we shouldn't have started all these wars for oil and hunger for power and money.   Hundreds of thousands kids were murdered.  That's the price for the profit of the military industrial complex.
7763 2018-07-26 07:32:42 No I’m gonna drunk because of my lunch, I was eat too much sesame oil chicken omg 
not now...I just woke three hours ago.
7764 2018-07-26 07:32:36 To put it in perspective. Brown selling gold at a low may have cost the uk £5 billion. The mismanagement of our oil reserves could be up to £400 billion.
7765 2018-07-26 07:32:32 And what hits oil tanker, hits warship!
And vice' versa
7766 2018-07-26 07:32:25 The global "Currency war" shall creat problems for Asia including India too,because we are biggest importer of Oil, Arms and equipment.
It will hit our Capital Account Deficit and other hand we don't have much foreign exchange ($400 billion) as compared to China ($3.8 trillion).
7767 2018-07-26 07:32:21 who is commander in chief of all Armed Forces?
7768 2018-07-26 07:32:10 Saudi oil tanker tooo??

7770 2018-07-26 07:31:56 Took the day off cause it's #WashDay  slept with honey and extra virgin olive oil in my hair to kick start. Now to get up and do my thing.
7771 2018-07-26 07:31:55 Our members of Congress, not to mention POTUS and FLOTUS have government sponsored healthcare (socialized medicine), we use taxpayer dollars to subsidize farmers and big oil, and have bailed out the banks...we already have socialist policies in place, people.
7772 2018-07-26 07:31:39 The oil companies who received this tax break, managed to issue around 13bn in dividends, Norway extracted around 90% by volume and received 14bn  I ask you, which government would use this resource to the advantage of its citizens Holyrood or Westminster,
7773 2018-07-26 07:31:36 Not everyone is lucky like you. So, just try to support the truth and breakout from the bondage. Good luck

7775 2018-07-26 07:31:10 Alaskans own 106,200 shares of HIBISCUS PETROLEUM BHD, worth $10,679. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in MALAYSIA.
7776 2018-07-26 07:31:07 @MalmstromEU @peteraltmaier @JunckerEU  is in the world no other land‘s to make deals with? Why you need USA? Venezuela, iran, russia, china, turkey are very good partners. We need to say #stopusa why we dont pay oil in our currency?
7777 2018-07-26 07:31:01 Saudi oil tankers are targets as well. They even more valuable and more painful!

7780 2018-07-26 07:30:15 Well since increasing Gas exports to EU will hurt the Russian econ almost as much as the US massively increasing its oil production like it has.... your tweet makes no god damn sense and you are out of touch with reality
7781 2018-07-26 07:30:11 Oil pulling?
7782 2018-07-26 07:30:10 Errm depends on the kind of rice; jollof, fried, coconut, curry, pepper, white, palm oil,
7783 2018-07-26 07:29:27 Nah, only once and they let me pass, I've heard about people's several encounters though. But it has drastically reduced now, like I hardly see em, and the security here is okay.
7784 2018-07-26 07:29:25 South West yoots that were calling for Saraki’s head on a platter are now speaking from both sides of the mouth. Buhari making a fool of himself. He tried to ambush Saraki and shot himself on the foot. There’s nothing they won’t offer Saraki even oil well. This is enuf evidence.
7785 2018-07-26 07:29:09 @AjuriNgelale clearly is pro apc....he said savings in oil is gone up but can someone tell him that oil price hv bn going up for two years now and he shld recall obj met lower price yet we didnt into recession

7792 2018-07-26 07:27:52 Petroleum companies in their quest to extract oil and gas from deep ocean sources will continue to have epic blow outs. More DWHorizon level mishaps will occur as peak oil gets farther and farther in our rear view. The complexity and risk of each new deep project increases.
7793 2018-07-26 07:27:35 Well now you're just being silly. I can't remember any experts suggesting we do that. Fracking will bridge the gap in uk energy needs as oil becomes more scarce. It will also fund research in to renewables and protect the economy. Essential for investment in the public sector

Buy Russian oil/gas? buy Russian weapons? accept Crimea accession? Ukraine?
Your carrot is not big enough for Putin!

7802 2018-07-26 07:26:45 Not sure McLaren is an oil tanker anymore. If it is then it’s been drifting at sea for 5 years and now is perilously close to breaking apart on the rocks
7803 2018-07-26 07:26:32 We have extracted more oil then Norway and benifited less. Partly because they invested the money and we blew it on tax cuts.
7804 2018-07-26 07:26:30 Saudi oil ship attacked in the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait.  Iran may shut down the Strait of Hormuz.  China to build second Suez Canal?
7805 2018-07-26 07:26:22 You hear so much about how much food is waste but on farms it’s the waste that goes to livestock. 
Eg 
1 kg of Cotton means 1.3 kg cotton seed
1 kg of canol oil = 1.2 kg of seed pulp & husks
1 kg flour= 200 gms of bran & offal 
All end up in landfill if not eaten as stockfood
7806 2018-07-26 07:25:52 I have heard that. But I have also heard sustainable is not really sustainable. Kroger had a product that said it came from sustainable Palm oil.
7807 2018-07-26 07:25:35 I think the most incredible thing about oil painting is its flexibility and vividness. You can continue to do your work till your satisfaction. Aside from the pain of clearing the brushes and palettes, it's oddly satisfying!! 
7808 2018-07-26 07:25:26 Hi Colette! Which oil was it that you were referring to! We can see if we still stock it or recommend another! - Ellenor

7814 2018-07-26 07:24:21 This alleged Houthis attacks on oil tanker is a desperate & pathetic attempt by the KSA to draw US into their reckless war on Yemen. KSA/UAE have claimed in the past 4 years that Houthis targeted "Humanitarian/civil ships that were found baseless claims by the US ARMY

I once heard the phrase economic terrorism from an American at a seminar a long time ago in the context of changes to oil prices. I'm sure that Great Britain said the same about the Dutch in the 1650s and 1660s..
7862 2018-07-26 07:16:03 Okay then! Glad y’all know  oil that ass up

7875 2018-07-26 07:13:29 1/ The difference between @MaltaToday’s oil scandal (incidentally why is that stuck?) and what happened last year is quite simple, the prime minister (Gonzi) acted responsibly. He was briefed and allowed the police to do their job. The police and AG in turn did their job.

I prefer LCHF as it’s easier, more satiating and gives wider choice. Tastier too.

I eat shitloads of steak, cold meats, nuts, fat-based curries (thai style eg red/green & satay) and loads of salads with cheese, meat and olive oil.

7919 2018-07-26 07:06:49 In Norway the tax revenue is 45 percent of gdp. In the U.K. it’s 37 percent. None of that has anything to do with the selling of oil rights 30 plus years ago. It did finance short term cuts to taxes in the 80s though. trouble with that model is that you run out of things to sell

8005 2018-07-26 06:51:07 You wouldn’t think it looking at some of the areas I travel in,  should be as wealthy as any other oil producing country but alas were not
8006 2018-07-26 06:50:57 How hard is it to do your oil pan
8007 2018-07-26 06:50:47 Idk when you mix it with some oil too it can get unhealthy....especially for my bank account  we live and learn

8013 2018-07-26 06:48:10 Energy & Economics with Borenstein at @BerkeleyHaas. We played both power and oil simulation and learned so much about how human factors influence strategy beyond pure economics. Turn that into a game.
8014 2018-07-26 06:47:35 This is as a result of poor management. Then corruption, worst in the world. Fall in Oil prices.

8017 2018-07-26 06:46:54 oh 'cause i only had two hours that's just oil. first i covered them in too much salt, then pepper, rosemary, thyme, and the chili powder that comes in a packet. and minced garlic which probably won't have much of an affect in two hours.
8018 2018-07-26 06:46:46 Seeing what Qatar is doing with their oil money makes me wonder if Nigeria is selling groundnut oil.

8026 2018-07-26 06:44:45 Hahaha.

You used the oil companies analogy. Are you saying if I meet someone today and I realize they bring toxicity to my life, I could have played a part in making them toxic?

8071 2018-07-26 06:36:08 At the moment I see this as a negative .... to ask for only £1m with the price of oil as it has been for some time creates a doubt in my mind about their funding ..... I would have thought they could have covered this amount without asking people for it ..

8076 2018-07-26 06:35:17 And I advice you to know more about our source of revenue. And if you went to a proper school, and you know about the value of crude oil in the market, you should have kept quiet.

8078 2018-07-26 06:34:50 A good tip for cooling is to add crumbles/small pieces of chocolate (called seeding) instead of water! Alternatively you can add a small bit of coconut oil if you need it to be easier to work with. Also a candy thermometer helps a ton with tempering 
8079 2018-07-26 06:34:47 Brent crude  led oil prices higher, extending gains into a third day after Saudi  Arabia suspended crude shipments through a strategic Red Sea shipping lane and as data showed U.S. inventories fell to a 3-1/2 year low

8082 2018-07-26 06:34:20 We simply can not afford even a day in limbo. Economy is so weak that it can not withstand a month or two Crisis. Whatever it is, accept it an move on.  IMF is looming, further devaluation pretty much on cards, Inflation. OIL prices.
8083 2018-07-26 06:34:20 But we have to remember that #oil prices are up by 50% since last year and it seems unlikely in the current environment that they will fall.

So even with the discount & drop in oil exports by 25%, the #Iranian #economy should be fine as compared to the last couple of years. 2/2
8084 2018-07-26 06:34:16 Struggling North sea gets tax relief for decommissioning but oil and gas still heavily taxed.

I don't know of any subsidy for shale gas.

Loads of small scale bio gas projects but even if we did spend billions there still only enough bio gas for 10% of UK gas capacity
8085 2018-07-26 06:34:12 >>>Each year the oil and gas industry emits more than 8 
million tons of health-harming methane......

Methane is a greenhouse gas, but it is non-toxic, it isn't considered a volatile organic compound & doesn't contribute to photochemical smog formation....get the science right.

8133 2018-07-26 06:24:29 Yes absolutely, it’s critical to look at the #oil export revenues as opposed to just #Iran’s oil exports in barrels. With both a discount & drop in oil exports (in barrels) by 25% the #Iranian government revenues will fall substantially. 1/2

8269 2018-07-26 06:02:19 It's vital even oily skin gets moisture because, without it, the skin will overcompensate for the loss of hydration (with more oil), leading to breakouts and an uneven skin texture. Take note: Moisturizing adds water to the skin, not oil.

8408 2018-07-26 05:38:26 I bought a moisturizer not knowing it had coconut oil and it’s breaking me out but I don’t want to return it and go all the way out to Honolulu just for that
8409 2018-07-26 05:38:17 You must be really stupid to say USA is self sufficient in oil. USA consumes 20 million barrels of oil a day while produces 11MBPD and another 2MBPD via ethanol and natural gas liquids. Rest 7 million barrels is imported!

India needs ToT, not USA. Don't make a fool of yourself

Destruction of the forest has major collateral effects that we Westerners do not comprehend.

8431 2018-07-26 05:33:28 they needed more value adding brands, selling peanut butter is great, but there are other value other channels they should of targeted. or made an attempt. and dont use the word dick smith across say peanut oil, new brand, protect the underlying brand itself
8432 2018-07-26 05:33:21 She is naturally a bit paler? She isn't super bleached normally? They literally filmed their mv in okinawa on the beach and all (except for dahyun with her weird ass skin) got tans. Jihyo even bought tanning oil to tan on purpose. They are tan now, but were paler before.
8433 2018-07-26 05:32:40 personally dick smith should of thought bigger and exported their products to china and built different channels to how they were as a business, like milk, dick smith milk, should of done yogurts, dick smith peanut butter, should of exported peanuts overseas, peanut oil
8434 2018-07-26 05:32:39 Lol how stupid is she, during that time every country was falling and we were stable. It was erap’s doing why peso fell not gloria and we had no control of oil prices then, as middle east was rising the prices. Do some research ms. Poe.

8441 2018-07-26 05:31:33 @HSN @DrPaulNassif's serum oil is nothing but silicone, vitamin E, and soybean oil, one of the CHEAPEST, least impressive oils used in face product formulation. Read about all carrier oils for proof (compare prices of 1 gallon of his soybean, then green coffee & cucumber seed!).
8442 2018-07-26 05:31:26 For me L'Oréal Paris Colorista works the best, but Syoss Color (not oil intense) works good too!

8538 2018-07-26 05:14:15 Washington's unilateral withdrawal from the Iran Nuclear Deal appears to be merely part of the bigger plot of regime change in Iran. Like metal to a magnet, America is attracted by oil.

8560 2018-07-26 05:09:45 The oil and gas industry has provided the energy the world has needed for over a hundred years - at very affordable prices.

as much as i love getting a massage i think i prefer to give them cause my back is soooo ticklish
but i do enjoy my ass getting rubbed with oil
& i swear the lady who just massaged me did such a good ass rub i could’ve sworn she was gonna suck my titties any sec
8565 2018-07-26 05:09:02 My understanding was more than a decade ago automakers could make their cars vastly more fuel efficient with already existing off the shelf parts that cost a couple of bucks.

So, not buying it. Becoming more efficient affects oil’s bottom line & Trump only cars about coal & oil!
8566 2018-07-26 05:08:50 How is their oil you interests?
8567 2018-07-26 05:08:47 Who exactly told you that God has anointed him? Did you witness this anointing? Did a heavenly Angel come down and anoint his head with oil? I ask because he doesn’t behave or talk like a man anointed by God Someone who has seen the light of God  doesn’t behave as this one does.
8568 2018-07-26 05:08:13 Even if they don't, the market will take care of it. Since cost is increasingly key in this industry, oil sands days are numbered. 

Stagnancy, then ever shrinking until nothings left. That is the future of o sands.

8592 2018-07-26 05:02:30 I chopped up zucchini, mushrooms, heirloom tomatoes, onions, garlic, and sautéed it up in some olive oil then added pine nuts, oregano, salt, pepper, fresh basil and spinach at the end and some Parmesan on top of some pasta

8662 2018-07-26 04:49:44 Facts are still facts even if the president thinks if enough people believe it, it must be true. At times I feel sorry for them, my dad was a rump moron, I still love him. How will they react when they find they bought snake oil from 45 & the gop?

8686 2018-07-26 04:45:34 In the 90s as conservation group staff, now and then, I interacted/negotiated with oil industry exec's who opposed creating more parks.  Most were so arrogant and didn't realize it. Unbelievable entitlement.

8691 2018-07-26 04:43:35 We were already in the EEC by that point. The 3 day week was largely a knock-on effect of the 70's oil crisis at the time coupled with the sclerotic nature of UK industry at the time that was being controlled by the unions. Being in the EU (as it became) was irrelevant.

8696 2018-07-26 04:42:41 Yip. We are in the error of oil peak and people don’t seem to realize that.
8697 2018-07-26 04:42:19 I believe every word of that. I lived and worked in Calgary most of my adult life. I worked on the fringe of the oil business all that time. They act like slave owners we see on TCM old southern movies.

8714 2018-07-26 04:37:46 There are many factors to consider when you evaluate the worth of something, not just the price. Is the annihilation of #orangutan populations worth the price of a cheaper cooking oil? Each person has to decide for himself/herself.

8740 2018-07-26 04:33:02 Castor oil ! 
8741 2018-07-26 04:33:01 Absolutely! I'm making more at a company that sells vegetable oil than I did at LV. I was excellent at my job at LV, but it's been amazing to do something mostly new as well. And no one wants me to buy them veg oil like they asked for LV stuff. 
8742 2018-07-26 04:32:59 How much oil traffic comes through this sea lane?
8743 2018-07-26 04:32:59 Ok. Now I’m convinced it’s probably a group of college kids taking turns writing this stuff. It can’t be real. “I spit in her coconut oil”? ...c’mon!

8750 2018-07-26 04:30:46 There's a very straightforward solution they overlooked: leave the oil in the soil!
8751 2018-07-26 04:30:45 Start with capex budgets? How much are the oil majors & other NOCs spending on capex yearly? Petronas has to spend on capex if it wants to play in the big league. If revenue is distributed to the states, what's left over for capex? And dividends?

8788 2018-07-26 04:25:21 Well I see About 80% of the oil wells won't get drilled so that's $45 billion in economic activity down the drain and Polis is so radical I envision policies like MoonBeam Brown of California. That's trouble enough in my book!
8789 2018-07-26 04:25:11 "Black women smell like coconut oil, taste like honey and chocolate, and look like God." A word.
8790 2018-07-26 04:25:06 Guns are fundamentally designed to kill people. Giving people more killing machines doesn't reduce the risk of shootings. Putting oil on a fire doesn't make the fire go away. I don't get why we have to keep explaining something a 5 year old would understand to grown adults.

8844 2018-07-26 04:14:20 I’m not against spending and taxing more but they are still running surpluses the U.K. has North Sea oil money as well but they choose to spend it rather than save it. It’s still a decision about allowing expenses to exceed revenue.
8845 2018-07-26 04:14:08 Unusual perspective...subtract cream from ice cream base and replace with neutral oil, tweak salt and sugar levels...you have mayonnaise

8852 2018-07-26 04:13:13 Over the years, profits from the oil industry were siphoned out of the country. Expats live in Weston, FL. The price of oil dropped in 2014. The country went into a tailspin because thats the main industry and it hasn't recovered. Socialism isn't to blame.
8853 2018-07-26 04:13:11 Sometimes I think of all the world changing events my parents lived through - Vietnam, Oil Crisis, JFK, Cold War, and the moon landing. Crazy to think that my parents will also see humans land on Mars in their lifetime.

8871 2018-07-26 04:10:28 You mean because even after all the insanely high costs of the West coast, the refineries here still make nine cents per litre more profit than they do in eastern Canada.  The oil companies are charg6more now than when oil was $100 a barrel. But yes taxes are also significant.
8872 2018-07-26 04:10:26 Then why were they doing better 15 years ago when oil was at a much lower price? Whoops.  Guess it has nothing to do with the evil Americans and their demands  for oil.

8892 2018-07-26 04:06:44 Disagree. A thawing Arctic is telling Russia that oil/gas/other resources/shipping routes there are more accessible and more valuable, which is why they're investing in icebreakers that will help them secure greater control.

8960 2018-07-26 03:58:05 I had a friend ask me to do marketing for her start-up essential oil business. I was all, "A, I know way too much actual science to ever be ok with that, and B, you deserve so much better than this, they will drain you dry."
8961 2018-07-26 03:57:54 I agree with most of this, but I think we’re getting closer to energy independence with natural gas and oil gotten from shale. The lack of pipelines are the current bottleneck.

8963 2018-07-26 03:57:33 Jordan is a founding member of the house freedom caucus- the anti-American government 'nutter' wing of the t-party- elected by dark money (mostly funneled through NRA & multinational oil/gas interests) to disrupt the proper functioning of congress & undermine our democracy.
8964 2018-07-26 03:57:26 Soak bud in warm water for a couple hrs, drain, repeat a few times then make oil, butter or tincture. Takes out most of the bad flavor

8969 2018-07-26 03:56:51 Billy man I know you’re intelligent.0+0 does not equal 4.Obama said 1% GNP would be the new norm. Said we would never see 3% again.People laughed Trump when he said we were going to 3% “pretty quick”.Obama’s plan was to kill coal, manufacturing and oil. Trump got them going and..

8971 2018-07-26 03:56:45 The Tullow Oil Company has from yesterday ceased operations in Kenya, citing insecurity issues. But on a closer look, who makes up the top management? There are many more than what meets the eye.

8973 2018-07-26 03:56:43 No, even Teapot Dome was innocent in comparison. I’m sure Trump has parlayed oil reserves for a price as an after thought. He is selling the entire country and its resources for personal gain. He had no loyalty to country, only himself.  I’d trust a snake above this monster.

8977 2018-07-26 03:56:14 The color of the smoke varies with that is burning. If there is oil from the plants/vegetation or from a vehicle or rubber or gas/hydrocarbons,, the smoke will be dark grey to a brownish black, white is more water vapor/steam but some plants give off white smoke when smoldering
8978 2018-07-26 03:55:41 ...eggs and oil and VINEGAR!

8985 2018-07-26 03:53:55 On my LinkedIn page today, Keeping tabs on the Oil Business and all the dinosaurs I worked with. I saw a job that I was qualified(over)for. Low stress so just for fun I updated my CV and submitted. We will see what happens, l hadn’t applied for a job since 1992.
8986 2018-07-26 03:53:52 I'm buying 80/20 ground beef, salmon, chicken (breast,thighs, legs, wings), bison, and pork ribs. If I'm eating a leaner meat like chick breast I'll make sure to put olive oil or avocado oil to make it higher in fat
8987 2018-07-26 03:53:50 ithink my boobs are really sore cus full moon/cycle stuff and my piercing is so sensitive what should i put on it? lavender oil? tea tree?
8988 2018-07-26 03:53:49 Yeah like the koch brothers brilliant orientation to be born from a rich father. What you mean. Maybe that their father was knowledgeable enough to sell oil to Hitler. For the love of God stop listening to O'Reilly
8989 2018-07-26 03:53:45 I wonder if Mueller's team really knows who all is involved in this assault on America. It's not just Trump and his Russians, Bannon and his Mercers, the Sheikhs & their oil fields, or even all combined.

I'm not into conspiracy theories yet something here just doesn't add up.
8990 2018-07-26 03:53:42 I don’t understand why people want more dirt races in NASCAR.

If you want dirt racing, then attend a dirt track that’s hosting a race by a sanctioning body that runs on dirt.

IMCA, USAC, UMP, World of Outlaws, Lucas Oil, etc.

Just my 2 cents.
8991 2018-07-26 03:53:41 ชวนพี่ไปเที่ยวหน่อยยย
8992 2018-07-26 03:53:41 this week i found out that oil painting is not just slathering oil on a canvas. In fact, no bottles of oil can be seen laying about in the art studio at all. What if i get thirsty-
8993 2018-07-26 03:53:37 I guess hemp oil and other products are completely legal in all 50 states so I’m wondering how I could benefit from that.
8994 2018-07-26 03:53:14 hahaha iya
8995 2018-07-26 03:53:05 So your position is that you shouldn’t have to subsidize health care for your grandkids to keep them alive if they get sick through no fault of their own, but you should subsidize oil companies and give billionaires tax breaks they don't need? Seems a heartless idea.  Good luck.
8996 2018-07-26 03:53:00 Guess with all this rhetoric flying around, instigated by Trump, price of oil jumped, n American consumers end up paying high oil price 1
8997 2018-07-26 03:52:56 The struggle at @Arbys knowing they have curly fries AND potato cakes. Two very different versions of a potato fried in the same oil #blessed
8998 2018-07-26 03:52:53 "Don't let your hair get into your face while you sleep. The oil from your hair can cause acne."
8999 2018-07-26 03:52:51 @KarlAndersonWWE  coconut oil is really good for hair. I’d tell you to use it, but well....
9000 2018-07-26 03:52:39 Well, since they had to tear down a bunch of the town, dig out the oil, and rebuild less than 20 years ago, that probably didn't help keep rents low...
9001 2018-07-26 03:51:55 Socialism isn’t causing the starvation in Venezuela. It’s their over-reliance on oil production - largely due to high American consumption - that makes the Venezuelan economy so susceptible to dips in the market. Classic example of a strawman argument

9041 2018-07-26 03:45:48 Mayo is essentially just an egg/oil emulsion with an acid, ice cream is just an egg custard.  The cold will probably tone down the acid flavor, which isn’t that strong to begin with. 

To sum up, sure.

9046 2018-07-26 03:44:46 Trump has PURPOSELY aligned with Russia. He thinks they hold the key to the ISIS problem in the Middle East. He wants us to make oil deals with them. He wants name recognition in Moscow. He’s so conceited.

9048 2018-07-26 03:44:32 As good as it is for non-food items, coconut oil is the closest I will let it on a kitchen counter. It has no place in a Winfrey's sampler. I can hear them murmer "guess where I am, you picky dolt" in a cockney accent.
9049 2018-07-26 03:44:14 Clove oil is good for gum pain. If pain continues see dentist to make sure to dont have a dry clot (which is actually the wound still bleeding not being dry). Ice packs help with swelling and get some good pain killers!!

9055 2018-07-26 03:42:59 Good call except it's wrong. Miles driven started to fall with oil at $45 bucks a barrel. Fed loves to blame "Weekend At Bernie's" economy on high oil prices but in truth oil is .10 cents a cup. Economy being destroyed with ZIRP, regulation, Price Controls inc oil, & debt. Sorry.
9056 2018-07-26 03:42:31 Will the consumer pay a little more without cheep produce flooding the US market?  Yes and no. Depends on the price of diesel and fertilizer (more oil products). The US matches Russia in barrels per year now.  Obama and the left wants to go green. Farms don’t run on green energy.

9062 2018-07-26 03:41:44 Could be there's no oil to be transported!
9063 2018-07-26 03:41:40 Agreed on the supply although we shall watch the unconventional oil supply and extra capacity in case of price increase.  On multilateral vs unilateral sanctions, I am not sure how much that would make a difference.

9092 2018-07-26 03:36:54 So glad I bought the album. Very impressed with the way you can sing 'cock' so much without giggling.

7- Serve with gravy for dipping, if desired.
9100 2018-07-26 03:35:14 Uganda is set to become a major source of Uranium and are opening it's mineral exploration market so INDIA is seen to be eyeing this for quite some time. Also it will benefit in development of alternative supply of oil rather than depending on Iran alone.

9104 2018-07-26 03:34:48 @JunckerEU said he came to make a deal today and he did!  Good news for our soy bean farmers and LGN!  Russia won’t be happy about the oil. Great job
9105 2018-07-26 03:34:34 I seriously love the smell of eucalyptus and peppermint oil

9111 2018-07-26 03:34:17 Where are vineyards in Mississippi, and Mississippi wine sounds like it would have catfish and BP oil undertones.
9112 2018-07-26 03:34:05 This Oil rich POOR country will soon have to stockpile food, medicine all because you and your party allowed this to happen.  While labour abstains on nearly anything it can, @theSNP are working hard to mitigate your failures.   #yes2
9113 2018-07-26 03:34:01 The best solution will be to let the respective States manage their oil. This may include contracting out drilling activities to Petronas or any reputable oil drilling companies on long term basis. Thus no issue of paying royalties.

9126 2018-07-26 03:32:44 So...which is it...dont drill for oil or gas prices are too high?
9127 2018-07-26 03:32:32 Lmao! You folded! All ur tough talk about "trade renegotiation" and what a great negotiator U are was basically hot air. Then again, I am not surprised.

9132 2018-07-26 03:32:05 Hint. Look at how much money the USA spends on Subsidies. This year was $20 billion on just Farm bill. Now think what zero tariffs, zero subsidies will look like in the USA when they can't sell over priced AG produce or Oil. The US needs subsidies to compete!
9133 2018-07-26 03:31:25 I HAVE NO IDEA but it smells incredibly foul so I'm not taking any more chances than necessary

my other ebay turbo was inverted in transit & is soaked through with its own oil. everything i own is filthy

9151 2018-07-26 03:28:08 "Can you produce in INDIA an aircraft like this super constellation", Mr. Bakhshi was foxed and knew his answer lacked conviction.

9197 2018-07-26 03:21:50 I have also added some dried ginger, what you find in the spice section of a grocery store, to lotions and applied regularly also helps. 
Now for baths I tend to add espom salts, I use Doctor Teals, along with bags of green tea and peppermint oil to hot water to be useful. 2/?

9200 2018-07-26 03:21:45 There’s this trend I’m seeing in FB groups where crazy religious multi level marketing moms take CBD oil thinking it’s some kind of essential oil blend and then they flip their shit when someone tells them what it is. It almost makes FB worth it.

9218 2018-07-26 03:18:48 Olive Ranch olive oil is a favorite of mine. Many brands sold as 100% olive oil are actually adulterated with other cheaper oils. Honey spread at KFC??!! Please, buy packets of real honey...
9219 2018-07-26 03:18:40 My guess is that players and clubs are hamstrung in regards to what they can say/do. Squeaky wheels get no oil from the AFL atm. Listen to Libber on today’s #FreedomInACage podcast for some interesting perspective...
9220 2018-07-26 03:18:38 It has nothing to do with his job and everything to do with his attitude. I don’t care that he hauls BILLIONS of dollars of oil honestly. But yes because of him I should be grateful for all I have

9222 2018-07-26 03:18:23 Thank you for dragging them kicking & screaming.  Hussein Obama couldn't do it.  Bush 1 & 2 couldn't do it.  Clinton, or her husband wouldn't do it.

9227 2018-07-26 03:17:56 Also, NONE of those non-EU states trade exclusively under WTO rules: they mostly are in (or have negotiated deals with) one trading bloc or another or are 'independently wealthy' through oil etc.

That's why Brit Brexit 'negotiators' are crapping themselves: there's NO precedent!
9228 2018-07-26 03:17:52 This was a great camping tips article!!  The cotton balls with petroleum jelly are a great firestarter. I always take lavender essential oil too. It's good for burns (hello campfire face), sunburns, insect bites, and even to calm the mind. Hikers should take an ankle bandage.
9229 2018-07-26 03:17:42 After shutting out a CNN reporter today, what if the media shut out the president for a week?  Just refuse to cover his nonsense altogether.  Report on Good Samaritans, scandals in the EPA, oil spills, etc.  seriously.

9285 2018-07-26 03:10:54 America's condemnation of the Iran Nuclear Deal is being used as a pretext in the labelling of Iran as a threat to peace. Since the 1979  Revolution, Washington has been hellbent on revenge, as this oil rich nation has refused to bow to imperial dictums.

9289 2018-07-26 03:10:36 Seriously!! It's an interesting topic for psychoanalysis. How effortlessly politicians are able to sell snake oil! If you think about it, there are uncanny similarities between CowTerrorisim and reservation demands by the dominant communities. Same victimhood complex& delusion.
9290 2018-07-26 03:10:33 My next experiment is soap as a shampoo replacement. The trick is supposedly to use a two-step process. Washing your hair in soap - then doing a detangle and rinse in a very dilute vinegar solution. (Then rinse in water, dry and oil). I'll let you know how that works out!

9304 2018-07-26 03:08:57 Because god forbid we point out that the US is fucking destroying Venezuela's economy with sanctions in order to get them to bow down to US power so we can rob them of there oil.....
9305 2018-07-26 03:08:49 Venezuela is starving BECAUSE THE US GOVERNMENT IS IMPOSING HARSH ECONOMIC SANCTIONS. 

What Chavez did was basically distribute oil money fairly. Their GDP quadrupled under his reign. But since then oil prices have tanked, but the critical hit is US sanctions

9314 2018-07-26 03:07:15 The absurdity of believing big oil is out to get Musk speaks to the naivete of his shareholders. Grow up.

9328 2018-07-26 03:05:44 Agree. But Pakistan is unfortunately not endowed with oil wealth or a lucrative market to covet. Anyway it’s just petty and small minded to victimise small minorities in the name of religion. If not removed altogether, these clauses need to be changed to prevent misuse.

9424 2018-07-26 02:54:17 IMO fact that all waste is currently stored in a small space on the site where it was generated is a huge plus for nuclear compared to fossil fuel.
Where is all the waste from coal, oil, or natural gas combustion stored?
9425 2018-07-26 02:54:11 The “end of the petro dollar narrative” is outdated. Countries dont hold dollars primarily to buy oil from saudi arabia-also the us is a bigger producer of oil and natural gas than SA so countries still need dollars to buy oil and gas from the Us

9509 2018-07-26 02:43:18 Sex is cool but have you ever had a sensual rub down with coconut oil after muscle fatigue
9510 2018-07-26 02:43:07 Everybody knows it's the lemongrass essential oil, not lavender. Lavender is for transplant rejection. Duh.
9511 2018-07-26 02:42:57 I’m over here tryna be boujie and buy an Audi when I should really just humble myself and settle for a new Toyota Camry or some shit. They pretty and their oil change won’t cost me $300 every time.
9512 2018-07-26 02:42:52 EASY IN HOME PRODUCT:
coconut oil. Grab a tiny amount & using your fingers, rub them at a fast pace until they’re warm/hot. Then rub them on ya dark circles before bed & you’ll notice the different in the morning!
9513 2018-07-26 02:42:51 The vast majority of the economy was still capitalist. Sounds like you need the education.

And they were still selling those nationalized resources (i.e. oil) on the global, capitalistic markets. It was state capitalism that failed them. And we meddled with them to boot.
9514 2018-07-26 02:42:51 Hmmm, lemme see fify, where do I start?
Trump is kicking Putin’s ass (boosting US Oil & Nat Gas production, increasing sanctions, arms to Ukraine) not licking his boots. Russia is an economic pipsqueak, BUT they control left over nukes. Best to “talk nice” while undermining him
9515 2018-07-26 02:42:48 Any room to discuss sustainable palm oil sourcing as well?
9516 2018-07-26 02:42:36 And a grifter snake oil Jesus salesman
9517 2018-07-26 02:42:15 Too bad. We are an Agricultural nation before the advent of Crude Oil. We're spending that much on food importation because, we have abandoned everything about Agriculture & focus all our attention on Oil, which is not even accounted for, due to non metering of all our Oil wells.
9518 2018-07-26 02:41:55 Oil pen give me headaches 
9519 2018-07-26 02:41:52 My mom has a mustang that she never drives and she has “taken” with a wolf on one side and an oil rig on the other.  she’s divorced from that guy now.
9520 2018-07-26 02:41:52 It’s all about money and oil. Trump is helping Putin by having the US navy block Iran’s oil from getting out to be sold and Putin is price gauging. Trump has made shady deals and Putin controls him. It’s not about peace. It’s about Trumps Russian money playground
9521 2018-07-26 02:41:51 
9522 2018-07-26 02:41:44 That wild hair growth oil made my hair sooooooo thick , it was already thick before but damn 
9523 2018-07-26 02:41:42 映画館で、泣くのはやだなーww
9524 2018-07-26 02:41:25 I found a way to prevent that!  Buy Argan Oil in a spray form (it should be in the hair care area) spray under your boobs. It works for me. Also a cheap alternative that sounds weird but works use panty liners. Baby powder works too but I hate using it.
9525 2018-07-26 02:40:58 With half the oil production of Canada ,Norway has a trillion $ surplus & Alberta has a deficit of $100 million & not enough money to deal with abandoned wells.Norway owns the oil.Canada only gets $3. a barrel in royalties + gives big subsidies to oil companies
9526 2018-07-26 02:40:53 Ordered #vetiver essential oil this month because I’ve heard it does amazing things for not only anxiety but sleep as well. excited to try it tonight! What do you guys use vetiver for?! #yleo #essentialoils #needthosezzzz

9528 2018-07-26 02:40:33 Lol. Unfortunately u just fall for her tricks. What she said is not true and everyone knew that the venz becomes this way is becoz of oil dependency. But hey! Facts don't matter to u anyway. Midwest u say? Taking our taxpayers money bailout those welfare queens is what happened.

9535 2018-07-26 02:40:09 They were still selling that oil on the global capitalist markets, which crashed in price.

Venezuela isn't proof of shit, and you're too blind toes it.

9547 2018-07-26 02:38:26 That @realDonaldTrump is a two-bit snake oil salesman.

9549 2018-07-26 02:37:48 They were going to use as leverage no longer purchasing from us. They folded under pressure. Also, soybean oil is not the same thing as whole soybean.

9556 2018-07-26 02:37:27 The oil industry is the well-funded institution that is distorting science and creating doubt about the reality of anthropogenic global warming. Naomi Oreskes ("Merchants of Doubt") got it right.
9557 2018-07-26 02:37:21 Extra virgin olive oil
9558 2018-07-26 02:37:11 definitely try cbd oil!!!

9566 2018-07-26 02:36:01 What about places such as Southern Cameroons, where oil was found in the 1970s. All resources of SC looted by Pres Paul Biya in Cameroon and sold to his French masters!
9567 2018-07-26 02:35:47 Ramen has lots of oil so I don't really like it.
9568 2018-07-26 02:35:25 Mayo is one of its ingredients, by the transitive property, Aioli= tricked up garlic & olive oil mayo.

9572 2018-07-26 02:34:18 This happened to me when I was a kid some kid spat gum onto my head. My mom covered it with coconut oil and then let it sit a while and was able to take most of it off. A tiny bit had to get cut out but wasn’t noticeable. Plus my hair smelled fucking amazing after 
9573 2018-07-26 02:34:05 Make your unbelievably shiny tresses? Hair oil!
9574 2018-07-26 02:34:03 I thought I’d never give in to this essential oil craze - but rn im diffusing lavender and orange and I am going to sleep a happy little bitty.
9575 2018-07-26 02:33:49 Surprising? The first bunch of poops are like alien oil sludges.
Happy? The first time my daughter woke up and smiled at me but after the potato stage.
9576 2018-07-26 02:33:43 Coconut oil and just work it out every strind till its free o.o
9577 2018-07-26 02:33:26 It was about making $$$ for themselves off big oil deals etc.   ‘Fighting terrorists’ is how they planned to sell it to all of us.
9578 2018-07-26 02:33:21 Is this an oil panting?
9579 2018-07-26 02:33:21 Oil kanum
9580 2018-07-26 02:33:19 I had a Toyota for 10 years and never changed the oil, I only added oil when the light came on, that's what I thought it was for. They don't make 'em like that anymore.
9581 2018-07-26 02:33:09 Through the oil crash companies loved laying off locals and keeping imports working for cheap. They also still pay contractors like oil is $40bbl.
9582 2018-07-26 02:33:08 The paint is so patchy. I’ll use an oil base next time
9583 2018-07-26 02:32:45 I’ve used conditioner for the longest time and I tried aloe a few months ago and it worked really good and then just last week I saw something about olive oil and it works GREAT!!!!

9585 2018-07-26 02:32:35 People with brains will just throw your fries into the basket and dunk them in the oil for a couple seconds. It’s bad for the oil, but it doesn’t take 3 fucking minutes
9586 2018-07-26 02:32:07 Well, I put sea salt and drops of thyme oil in a bath. Then, as soon as I got out I felt very weak, so I took a nap. Woke up feeling very refreshed. Then (TMI) about 30 mins ago, with no warning, no nausea, I had to vomit...
9587 2018-07-26 02:32:00 I’m gonna go ahead and change the oil on my car......at 9:30.  And I’ll also water the lawn, have a fire, and organize the garage.
9588 2018-07-26 02:31:47 Oh, I was in the olive oil business with his father, but that was a long time ago. That's all.
9589 2018-07-26 02:31:42 That's like vinegar and oil

9599 2018-07-26 02:30:48 Exactly what oil companies were banking on.  To make more $$ off of all of us --gasoline at the pumps, diesel for our truckers, airlines paying more for jet fuel.
Oil boys set this crap n2 motion on purpose, like w/Bush.
Encouraged him 2 go nuts w/Iran, knowing this would happen.

9608 2018-07-26 02:30:01 It was about making $$$ for themselves off big oil deals etc.   Fighting terrorists is how they tried to sell it to the country they are destroying for personal gain.
9609 2018-07-26 02:29:54 Semantics? I don't want to get into a fight. I look forward to reading your book. But Hormuz is a bigger AND more immediate threat to global oil flows; there is no work-around. Drawn out, this results in more ton-miles, not a supply cut. If oil spikes on this, it should be sold.

9633 2018-07-26 02:27:09 No this was a global thing in the 70s, they switched from frying in beef tallow to vegetable oil, after spending a lot of money on inventing a synthetic flavor extract to replicate the taste of beef tallow

9636 2018-07-26 02:26:59 Maybe Climate Barbie ought to ride her little red bicycle over there and let them know how to recycle all that cement, fibreglass,  oil, chemicals, rubber and wiring as the turbines are being decommissioned.
9637 2018-07-26 02:26:34 Aww, when we were kids our parents made us drink castor oil when we were sick . Awful  How did u get it in ur eye ?
9638 2018-07-26 02:26:33 That changing your oil every 3-5000k miles is not just a recommendation.

9641 2018-07-26 02:25:59 OK, but a point I was trying to make throughout is that you need to look in the mirror. NGP and organic, both of which you support, promote use of palm oil in processed food. They are just as much supporter of “Agribusiness” as Stuart and I are.
9642 2018-07-26 02:25:57 Haha no but she does use medicinal cannabis oil
9643 2018-07-26 02:25:12 As a black person, oil is SO much better than lotion for the body

9658 2018-07-26 02:23:34 If you’re in pain call them back and tell them it’s an emergency. Most dentists can squeeze you in. Also clove oil is great for tooth pain. 
9659 2018-07-26 02:23:24 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.

9663 2018-07-26 02:22:25 We caught it within a couple days so it was all good but Lyme isn’t nearly as common as it is in the NE where we moved from thank goodness!
9664 2018-07-26 02:22:23 Yes that's not the scary part about this. that's what the waves in some area used to look like. now they're covered in oil and dead fish and oil covered Birds. and they're doing their part for global warming. underneath the waves dead coral. That's what I see
9665 2018-07-26 02:22:20 マジでこれほんとに見つからなかったらどうすればいいんや、気になってしょうがない
9666 2018-07-26 02:22:11 Can't be afraid of heat, or weather. If grease and oil scare you that might be an issue but you gotta do what you gotta do to make that money. People depend on it.
9667 2018-07-26 02:22:09 I thought that theory of sovereignty went away sometime after Joan of Arc succeded in getting the Dauphin to Rheims where he could be annointed with the holy oil to rule as a true King of France (July 17, 1429).
9668 2018-07-26 02:22:01 Also I’m trying to get into essential oils and just recently ordered a diffuser. Gotta be honest - the Rosemary oil smells like thanksgiving and now I want stuffing 
9669 2018-07-26 02:21:38 I'm not gonna lie I needed that joint especially saying that after I been on oil for a while
9670 2018-07-26 02:21:38 The Saudis said they will pump more oil, the North Koreans said they will denuclearize. 

The only true story is when the Mexicans said they were not paying for the wall.

9672 2018-07-26 02:21:20 The Lord is my shepherd! Just a thought tonight, the scripture says he anointed my head with oil... that's a practice to keep away parasites and to keep the sheep from being stuck in the briar. God anoints our heads with oil to keep us from being trapped in the briar of the world
9673 2018-07-26 02:21:03 4 menit bersihin muka pake mw/cleansing oil

9674 2018-07-26 02:21:03 Drink tons and tons of water!!! Besides occasionally having coffee, water is all that I drink and I don’t use foundations or concealer any face makeup besides highlighter or mascara if I’m going somewhere or getting dressed up! Also- taking your makeup off with coconut oil helps!
9675 2018-07-26 02:20:52 Is this how crop circles are made?
9676 2018-07-26 02:20:15 My mate has a touch of arthritis, my mom in her feet, my 9 yr old has JRA. Hers we've managed with high doses of cod liver oil. She hardly ever has symptoms these days (she limped in pain at age 2), and is a gymnast.
9677 2018-07-26 02:20:01 @RachelNotley Alberta is so desperate to convince Canadians TM Expansion is a good idea that their TV ads are saying the pipeline will NOT result in increased oil production!If that is true why build it??

9680 2018-07-26 02:19:49 I’ve heard a firsthand account of a dude getting doused in baby oil and lit on fire when dudes in the cell block found out what he was in for. Nassar should consider himself lucky
9681 2018-07-26 02:19:45 Steal and aluminum are national defense items just like oil and we should be an independent non reliant country when it comes to national defense. Period
9682 2018-07-26 02:19:38 You're lucky the combo of tylenol & peppermint oil is all you need to fight your Migraine. It wouldn't touch mine by a long shot! Chronic Migraine sufferer - 15 days a month. Yippee!!! @msnaturallife22
9683 2018-07-26 02:19:28 The Chinese are buying oil from Iran, as well. I still think, Long Term, the Tariffs will work.

9690 2018-07-26 02:17:59 YB, I applaud on your precise, crystal clear justification on that 20%crude oil issue. It's disheartening to hear baseless arguments so it's refreshing to hv some grounds laid out for them to get the facts right.
Hope you'd respond too on FELDA& FGV  issues.
9691 2018-07-26 02:17:50 Boy you must need a lot of faith these days.

9697 2018-07-26 02:17:10 the way to wash them is to wear them in the shower :3 from what I understand they're fine with cum, no idea about piss (should be fine though). Just don't get oil on it and it should be all good
9698 2018-07-26 02:16:51 I meant the brands available. high quality stuff worth the price. They have it there, just not giant Costco version sizes. 

Lately been buying intermittently from the old Italian store I once tweeted at ya....not too far. Overdue for a visit too.

Avocado oil right now tho.
9699 2018-07-26 02:16:44 I like to add sesame oil

Company Market Cap is $15 Million
Just the reserves in Colombia are Before Tax $18.4 million
So no value attributed by market for Argentina ($89.1M).

9713 2018-07-26 02:15:07 Hi! The formula is lightweight. It’s made to lift lashes but also the coconut oil within the formula conditions lashes so they remain soft. Hope this helps! 
9714 2018-07-26 02:14:54 My issue with palm oil is that land is stolen from people who need it to grow food and rain forest is destroyed to feed the junk food industry and enrich a few people. Not to mention driving orangutans to extinction.  GMO or not GMO, I won't buy anything with it.
9715 2018-07-26 02:14:39 Scandinavians were socialists, and very happy, long before North Sea oil. Anyway the oil is only Norway’s. Do some research next time

9724 2018-07-26 02:13:25 That's just goofy. Oil, gas, coal, lumber and mining pay billions in taxes to the govt. Solar, wind, etc get subsidies.
9725 2018-07-26 02:13:22 #Samoa aims to be % reliant on #SustainableEnergy by 2025! That is brilliant.

I hope #Australia, albeit, a larger island nation, will soon follow suit & the Government will provide more incentives to reduce its reliance on #FossilFuels (big oil & gas plus coal).

#CleanEnergy
9726 2018-07-26 02:12:51 And those oil reserves are in the dispute zone since 1899 between Venezuela and Guyana. In theory, Guyana can't act over that area sovereignly.
9727 2018-07-26 02:12:51 Looking good, Kyle. As do your plants. I've been using a full plant CBD oil for several years. It helps me live thru the pain of RSD, come down on my percocet and morphine dosages, as well as getting me thru 7 spinal surgeries and a spinal infection this last year.

9730 2018-07-26 02:12:40 My first response to the OP, which implied that Stuart and I were big supporters of “Agribusiness” that was responsible for the killings, with blood on its hands, was that I support Canola over non-GMO palm oil (wink wink). Perhaps I was being too obtuse.
9731 2018-07-26 02:12:39 Dude, how high is you? That is so wrong.

Redeemable, though. 

Pro tip: wash the sock in hot water, 2 cycles, set aside; drop the burger into the toilet reservoir, set your alarm for Friday, two weeks hence. Toss burger with sock, pepper, and linseed oil. Serve tepid to my ex.
9732 2018-07-26 02:12:31 I love baby oil. It’s so weird 
9733 2018-07-26 02:12:06 Depends I guess on multiple factors..where in the country you live, the wildlife population eating your grain while you’re not looking lol, the bird population etc, in Ga. my granddaughter got a tick on the top of her thigh just from being in high grass.

9742 2018-07-26 02:11:19 The American people have heard this same thing about high gas prices for years. We no longer need to depend on oil from the Mid East. Allow the pipe line or just keep don’t say anything. We’ve heard it all before.
9743 2018-07-26 02:11:18 I got the degree but the only work I did was during the summers. The oil industry died here in the U.S. just before I completed my degree. Ultimately, I'm a scientist and it's science that influences my decisions.
9744 2018-07-26 02:11:14 Another aspect: big 3 rely on food manufacturers — whom are as blameworthy as big 3 — for business model. These folks benefit from blood palm oil to make cheap shit we call “food”. So big 3 benefit when cheap food model propped up.

9753 2018-07-26 02:09:48 "Pay with cash", Trump says. An electoral crime, the US says.

We have something similar here in Mexico with AMLO:
"Deposits and withdrawls in cash", says our electoral authority (INE), "are illegal". "Fuck the INE", says AMLO.
9754 2018-07-26 02:09:38 Shrink acne by placing a wrapped ice cube on it and leave it on the pimple for 3 minutes. Then cover it with a dab of lavender oil.
9755 2018-07-26 02:09:30 If sounds like you know nothing about the country. Their personal income tax rates (what you or I would pay) are actually lower than the US. This works because they tax natural resource extraction (gas, oil) at a very high rate under the theory that those are owned by the country
9756 2018-07-26 02:09:27 Hear, hear! And what about all the corporate welfare subsidies for oil, natural gas, coal, lumber, and mining? We give away billions to corporations who make billions and billions in profit.

9759 2018-07-26 02:08:47 That's when oil was $140/barrel .When oil prices fell so went the Canadian economy.we were in a recession
9760 2018-07-26 02:08:41 In other news, Trump is working on an agreement to increase Chinese consumption of American cheese curds and olive oil.
9761 2018-07-26 02:08:33 Nothing like a Man City youtuber trying to interview my cousin while I remind him his team is bought with oil money and they have no CL’s
9762 2018-07-26 02:08:24 And there’s a HUGE difference between the two. PP gets direct money subsidies for oil/gas industry are typically based on tax breaks NOT cash money. And the reason it’s done is because the taxes produced by said company and it’s employees far far outweigh any subsidy. Economics

9771 2018-07-26 02:07:50 They had a price advantage anyway. From what I saw in '70s magazines it was the corn and safflower oil producers who were advertising big time against saturated fat.
9772 2018-07-26 02:07:42 Do you plan on bringing back coal as a source of energy?
After all because there is no Carbon Tax it is very cheap and can be a great way to save money. In fact, by burning coal there will be a larger supply of oil and it can help bring gas prices down

9808 2018-07-26 02:02:51 Lots of oil in the region of Crimea. US didn't much care for efforts of Germans in 1942 to 'annex' the area. This is yet another reason for energy independence. Grain of salt for all... Jus' say'n.

9810 2018-07-26 02:02:36 Automatic transmissions get fucked up easily in alot of ways because they have sensitive parts and very complicated. The only way a manual can get fucked up is by being driven by someone who doesnt know how or if its being driven without oil

9826 2018-07-26 02:00:28 how so? At least its clean. You still have to pay for it, but wete not killing our planet. Of course #freeenergy is ideal, but in the meantime it's better than oil.
9827 2018-07-26 02:00:17 Like a vampire, he drinks oil out of robots.
9828 2018-07-26 02:00:14 I hope this is all just the beginning of a economic plan of action against China. Get the EU and NAFTA fixed and cohesive, then North America and Europe can leverage China. 

Also, if this possible alliance chose to, it could economically strangle Russia by restricting oil/gas.

9842 2018-07-26 01:57:03 I just want to wretch when I see the #Propaganda  @KeepCanWorking is spewing about the #pipeline. If They had Canada’s best interests at heart, they’d have a refinery in the god-forsaken oil sands, at the very least. Even then, oil isn’t fabulous for the environment.
9843 2018-07-26 01:56:47 But not the Russian media. 

Let’s just say you work for an oil company, and you tell a secret to a friend privately about your company. That friend tells the press. Do you ever tell that friend anything you want to be kept private?

Of course not.

9862 2018-07-26 01:54:43 Costco olive oil is watery, has next to zero viscosity, and smells like it was lightly sprayed with olive-scented perfume.

Real oil is thick, pungent, and probably cures cancer.
9863 2018-07-26 01:54:14 You should be good.
Hot oil kills all the bad stuff.
It's like completely sterile.
9864 2018-07-26 01:54:13 Thanks, Andy, bec old fossils are afraid of leaving fossil fuels like Congressmen are afraid of losing contributions from Big Oil.

9873 2018-07-26 01:53:17 It's funny. Back in the day, there was a black market for mummies and what you can make out of them. They would pulverize and powder them and sell them for whatever snake oil(powder?) you can market it as.

9881 2018-07-26 01:52:03 My point in bringing it up was that palm oil is an example supporting the op, even though it is not yet GMO.   So jumping from the the first point to a "discussion " about GMOs was off topic.  I agree with Jodi, the GMO topic should be in a new thread.
9882 2018-07-26 01:51:51 Copious examples like how lobsters work, despite lobster researchers dunking on him for being so completely wrong that the science proves the opposite of his assertions? Examples like how a clean room is crucial but he sits in a filthy kitchen? He’s a snake oil salesman.

9886 2018-07-26 01:50:40 It seems like oil is referencing the Holy Spirit, as it is used throughout the NT as an agent of ministry: Hebrews 1:9, James 5:14, and Mark 6:13.

9930 2018-07-26 01:45:06 I've been gaming for over 25 years. You could fit the "content" of the ENTIRE Destiny franchise to date in the first disc of Final Fantasy IX and it would rattle like a corn kernel in an oil tanker and that game came out nearly two DECADES and three console generations ago.
9931 2018-07-26 01:45:04 This is a perfect example of someone that is desperate for a change. That's how Trump works. He's a snake oil salesman plain and simple. I'd give them the benifit of the doubt. I have a lot of farmer friends that fell for his scheme and are now regreting it big time.
9932 2018-07-26 01:44:44 Oil Man went stargazing with Napalm Man as practice for what's to come
9933 2018-07-26 01:44:33 Kering ya? Coba rajin pake olive oil atau coconut oil.
9934 2018-07-26 01:44:26 fire green  u guys r snake oil    give us triple a or double a prices  i m a real native san diegan  get it together stop livin n past
9935 2018-07-26 01:44:25 What I’m hearing is that there’s an opportunity to combine the two:
“You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take. So buy this snake oil for improving shots. You won’t not regret it!”
9936 2018-07-26 01:44:25 They are all protecting & allowing Israel to dictate what is to be. All the Nato allies have no business in Middle East. Middle East is more land and oil grab for those running Israel and its aparthied objectives.
They use the holocaust to silence people & nations. No scruples!
9937 2018-07-26 01:44:20 Two smoked chickens. I have never smoked chicken. Rubbed with olive oil and garlic and some fresh herbs. I misunderestimated the time and had to finish in the oven. The meat fell off the bones...
9938 2018-07-26 01:44:16 Come over to @I80Speedway on Friday.  The @LucasOilASCS has a big race there later in September.  #valuablelaps
9939 2018-07-26 01:44:15 Trus paginya cuci muka pake air doang, trus abistu pake zaitun oil lagi. Setelah itu pake alat beuty deep HPAI. selama 3minggu wajahku bersih tnpa bekas ^^
9940 2018-07-26 01:43:54 In my opinion this is a strange comparison. Oil is used by almost everyone everyday in one way or another. EV’s are one choice of those that can afford to buy an car.  I like EV’s & would like to buy one one day, hopefully the market will support them until they become the norm.
9941 2018-07-26 01:43:33 Cenk. Senator Gillibrand received most of her current lobby money from rich lawyers, Wall Street, and gas, oil, and nuclear companies..you are scared stiff of having me on to say that..I will be saying it on my tv ads...
9942 2018-07-26 01:43:32 Mane satu  ko ni abam oil n gas weh...
9943 2018-07-26 01:43:31 We need to be talking about what God does for us.. like people be talking about CBD oil 
9944 2018-07-26 01:43:28 @kaitlancollins New Hero, keep asking those questions. “The truth may be stretched thin, but it never breaks, and it always surfaces above lies, as oil floats on water.”
9945 2018-07-26 01:43:25 JAI JINENDRA 

Bad attitude is just like bad engine oil. The longer you keep it running through your system, more damage it does to your drive.
9946 2018-07-26 01:43:15 No brainer analysis on $FB earnings - revenues outlook gloomy since cleaning of Russians bugs? Argh, they can spend lots, just look how much Oil prices now since Republicans took office.

9951 2018-07-26 01:42:31 This reminds me I need to check my oil 
9952 2018-07-26 01:42:22 The oil field literally fucked my definition of a relationship/marriage up. I’ve seen my husband every day for 3 weeks straight and it’s weird af. Like imagine seeing your SO one week out of the month for a year straight, then readjusting 
9953 2018-07-26 01:41:54 When my dad asks me if I’ve checked the oil in my Jeep is it bc he doesn’t know what else to talk about or.....???
9954 2018-07-26 01:41:53 Please have/do all these things scientists. Or don't and love science so much you can't be denied. Please... Sincerely: Science loving oil painter who thrives on the muses you inspire by way of your discoveries and contributions.
9955 2018-07-26 01:41:51 Could it be the price of oil, which has affected capital investment to similar degrees in other jurisdictions?
9956 2018-07-26 01:41:39 If you don't have enough time for a full shower shaving session, just smooth baby oil onto your legs before you take the razor to them.
9957 2018-07-26 01:41:35 昨日までの熱中症の蓄積で今日涼しくても頭いたいんだが
9958 2018-07-26 01:41:26 Your #WCW steals her childs baby oil to pose on instagram. He in school looking like an expired Chocolate bar
9959 2018-07-26 01:41:14 Not just Isreal,...France,UK,US have all participated in the horrific politics of regime change.Funding & weaponizing any group that will terrorize and lay waste to the security of Sovereign States.Can only surmise control of Oil wealth is the motive.
9960 2018-07-26 01:40:49 Try pakai milk la pulak cika. Ko cuba tgk dkt ig thepastelshop tu, banyak kot cleansing oil dia
9961 2018-07-26 01:40:44 ご心配をお掛けしました。

9962 2018-07-26 01:40:33 Bound Up in my Work. Bound Up in my Work. I'm a Turbine. I'm a Wheel. I am Gas Oil. I'm a Stone. I am Flaming Up. I'm a Wheel. I'm Explording on the Ground. Aaa-yeh!
9963 2018-07-26 01:40:13 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
9964 2018-07-26 01:40:09 Just read a book about alternate realities and I’m wondering how different my life would be if I was the type of person that could roll up to the beach and pull out tanning oil rather than SPF 70 (at the very MINIMUM)
9965 2018-07-26 01:40:01 Treasures of the Earth: Power is coming up at 9pm. Tune in for an examination of fossil fuels, including modern-day oil prospecting in California and a utility company that struggles to keep the lights on during hot summer days. #KLRU
9966 2018-07-26 01:39:50 That's really special, CNN pays you to paddle around some beautiful areas of AK while you put criticize the drilling for oil/gas and mining in the state, where the products came from, to fly you, and all your electronic equipment up there spreading lies on TV.
9967 2018-07-26 01:39:49 I've heard about the oil, but where are the gardens?
9968 2018-07-26 01:39:49 Coconut oil is my best friend tonight on my Snapchat.
9969 2018-07-26 01:39:42 Got covered in dog shampoo
Then water from the marine system getting clogged
Then salmon oil

Turns out, I’m allergic to salmon oil.
9970 2018-07-26 01:39:30 Played a round of disc golf, went for a paddle. Parked the paddle board, took a shower, heated up some pad Thai. Turned on oil diffuser along with air purifier and ate pad Thai while sitting on my bed. I can’t explain how great I feel rn.
9971 2018-07-26 01:39:05 Wonderful picture.   Typical prairie picture except Turner Valley first in early oil discovery
9972 2018-07-26 01:38:48 I looooove light pasta sauces. Pesto, olive oil, etc.
9973 2018-07-26 01:38:47 Purivera botanicals sis, sebenernya face oil biasa gt tp kujadikan cleansing. Mayan sis masih kebeli untuk dompet paspasanku
9974 2018-07-26 01:38:44 So you’re just sitting on cash until tax season?  Lol - Let me guess your business:   Food truck?  CBD oil distribution? Concert venue management?
9975 2018-07-26 01:38:42 honestly all that my dad gives af about is whether the oil is changed or not in my car too
9976 2018-07-26 01:38:36 Says everything you need to know about this snake oil, con artist.
9977 2018-07-26 01:38:31 Hoping your not sitting down with the oil companies in the same manner. Please protect our waters.
9978 2018-07-26 01:38:26 Means nothing
9979 2018-07-26 01:38:20 Made an insect bite salve with pine oil, white willow bark, arnica and beeswax. I love making my potions and salves. Homemade skincare and plant medicine salves for the skin.
9980 2018-07-26 01:38:13 ルーラが言ってた
OILって3回書いて点を打つと音がサザエさんっぽくなるって

A big yella ass rubbed down in baby oil
9983 2018-07-26 01:37:51 ใช้แอปไรวาดคะ
9984 2018-07-26 01:37:45 horsefeathers! Administrations spew lies like oil derricks spew oil. Nothing new.
9985 2018-07-26 01:37:37 Been using this combination of Coconut oil and Arlos beard oil on my beard and my shit been looking extra full these days.

9989 2018-07-26 01:37:03 Making the olive oil and lemon switch was one of the best things I did for my diet.
9990 2018-07-26 01:36:50 Time for a bag change and Zimmer oil Lou.
9991 2018-07-26 01:36:42 So ten lbs x 2 plus a ten pound bar = 30 pounds.

Just saying. Not worth ticks.
9992 2018-07-26 01:36:23 I remember when I used to think that topping my salads with olive oil instead of an actual dressing was weird.

Now? Using anything BUT olive oil is weird and I see dressing as extremely unhealthy and unneeded carbs and calories.
9993 2018-07-26 01:36:22 One thing that's really cool is that Country Scents sells a lot of our oils in roller-type bottles, so you can roll a little bit of the oil onto your wrists or wherever you want it, like peppermint oil around your temples for headaches.
9994 2018-07-26 01:36:10 Is that like the Saudi’s that told you they would release oil? And how you say Cohen who hardly know the guy. He has nothing on me. Funny sounds just like what you say about Putin. He has nothing on me, never met him.
9995 2018-07-26 01:36:03 Olive oil tasting. Wine/beer tasting. Dinner theatre at Mayfield. Drive out to a small town to one of their resturants.
9996 2018-07-26 01:36:03 Cashed out, full tank, quick oil change,  new home renovation.... yes today went absolutely well for me !!
9997 2018-07-26 01:35:46 Coconut oil and ice are magic!!
9998 2018-07-26 01:35:41 I be laying in bed sipping tea with my oil diffuser in the background happy AF
9999 2018-07-26 01:35:40 OIL BRENT US$73.96/bbl +0.5%. Lukoil's Yuri Korchagin new Phase-2 platform in northern Caspian Sea flows first oil at 500tpd.
10000 2018-07-26 01:35:38 CBD oil will change that.
10001 2018-07-26 01:35:38 Why did I put on all this baby oil like a damn fool 
10002 2018-07-26 01:35:34 Literally every cell in my body is made of hatred of anxiety. 100% pure, extracted by way of the the best technology, allergen-free, sterile, essence of limitless hate potential, fuck-you-anxiety essential oil. DM NOW for your free trial pack and get free gut-wrenching nausea!
10003 2018-07-26 01:35:27 My entire dinner was deep fried. Whether it be the protein or the dessert I can assure you it all got a healthy bath in boiling oil #ThisIsAmerica
10004 2018-07-26 01:35:08 The classic "ad hominim" attack on the messenger, a simple logical fallacy. Yes, almost all activists use oil in some form, hypocritically, but that does, in no way, invalidate their message.
10005 2018-07-26 01:35:01 When I started off oil just took what they gave me
10006 2018-07-26 01:34:58 Haiphong: "For 7years, US ruling class united w/broad array of  vultures2suck Syria dry--of its independence,  sovereignty+oil+gas resources. Israeli, Turkish, Saudi, Qatari+European oligarchs joined forces w/US2launch offensive in 2011 aimed at destroying Arab nationalist state"
