17 2018-01-25 23:58:37 A lot of us who believe in crypto as a method of payment are sick of btc. FYI: tether-bitfinex-blockstream (bitcoin core devs) are all connected. Blockstream markets btc as a store of value while tether pumps the price. 

This is also why bitcoin cash forked in August.

43 2018-01-25 23:58:18 And most of the problem with crypto and BTC purists is that they do not understand that USABILITY, MARKETING and SAFETY are whats going to make any coin win the race. 

Bitcoin is only ahead because it was first and it has the most recognized name.

51 2018-01-25 23:57:28 @RobinhoodApp announcing crypto currencies into their platform was the biggest news today!!!
52 2018-01-25 23:57:27 XRP scam とかで検索ですかね〜

根本的な所は、非中央集権を理想とする人が否定的なのだと思います。

海外のリップラー達が、少し前に日本でやっていた？今もやっている？事と同じ様にみんなの誤解を説く議論をしてますね。

私は非中央集権の中央集権を問わず両方の可能性にワクワクしています。
53 2018-01-25 23:57:21 1/1 Lol...so now we are basing this on media validation and support? The media doesn't give a crap about being fair or objective. The amount of fake news and FUD they spread on a daily basis against the crypto community is sickening!!!

62 2018-01-25 23:56:43 Block this bum. Simple
63 2018-01-25 23:56:41 Yea that's true, but we're not dealing with realists here :(. We're dealing with crypto-realists.
64 2018-01-25 23:56:41 Sounds like  the beginning of a joke: a central banker, a Keynesian economist, and Financial editor walk into a bar...,,  (ENTER PUNCHLINE)
65 2018-01-25 23:56:35 Free give away  honestly been trying to be part of your giveaway on steemit for a while too
66 2018-01-25 23:56:33 They always interview these people whose best interest is not that of $BTC.  WTF. But in all honesty does $BTC have a top influencer that wants $BTC succeed?
67 2018-01-25 23:56:31 hodling my ticket! where's them wallets at?!
68 2018-01-25 23:56:17 Incorrect. The difficulty adjusts so rapidly that any chain split will survive if supported. There was a clean consensus again.
69 2018-01-25 23:56:01 He said that was his original twitter and he let his daughter take it over. It's ok to communicate through that account and he will change it. Also, he's offering his email if you want it.
70 2018-01-25 23:55:58 i loveThe Crown (on Netflix). If i have to break away to be a better Crypto trader I will, but only reluctantly. :-)
71 2018-01-25 23:55:56 そうですよね。北朝鮮からミサイルが飛んできた時もBTC買われてた記憶がありますね。地政学リスクの高まり→BTC上昇というのは少なからずありそうな気がします。
72 2018-01-25 23:55:56 i was talking about TRX, wrong post man. Sorry :D

75 2018-01-25 23:55:30 CJ organised a small group of regular students for me - all women. She doesn't pay attention. Her Crypto method is simply 10mins each morning picking 5 cryptos to 'punt on' til 5pm. CJ cares not for background info. At 5 pm she checks her results. She's up 412% since Jan 1! WTF?
76 2018-01-25 23:55:12 After finally getting motivated by not understanding bitcoin and crypto currencies I did some research. Safe to say that I will not be buying into the hype and the only people making money in these schemes are the people right at the very beginning.
77 2018-01-25 23:55:07 I have big doubts about Bankera. I am not sure if they can deliver what they promise. I hope everything works fine. But don't forget that Bangor traded much lower than ico price for a long time.
78 2018-01-25 23:55:02 That's how you know it's centralized.
79 2018-01-25 23:54:57 I’m thinking more like MyFootballClub w.r.t. Ebbsfleet United. But sure, we can take a crypto angle.

84 2018-01-25 23:54:28 You're comparing bona fide trading to fake zero fee trading on crypto exchanges.

96 2018-01-25 23:53:27 We’ve got cryptoclaws, 50 cent ‘realizing’ gains, Snoop Dogg tweeting crypto, Robinhood, square cash, and media hype all in past couple days. CME futures coming up. I can’t even imagine how bullish you are right now
97 2018-01-25 23:53:23 Crypto-Islamists want her gone, you say? Hard to think of a more ringing endorsement of her appointment.
98 2018-01-25 23:53:21 whats remarkable to me is the amount of overlap between crypto projects and the real world problems. Very hard to discern subtle differences in technical aspects. What seems to differentiate is the quality of marketing. #Crypto #Altcoins #research
99 2018-01-25 23:53:12 I know people personally  (not just online) who love xrp, those people exist. I don't share their enthusiasm abt xrp, but pretending those people don't exist does not make sense to me. They consider themselves a part of crypto world and I am happy with them
100 2018-01-25 23:53:07 This exact point is one of my meta-fascinations w crypto:
101 2018-01-25 23:52:58 He's my anti-oracle  I listen carefully and do the opposite
102 2018-01-25 23:52:54 . @CryptoMoezus we need adoption for the space to grow and flourish, but these lambo kitties are killin my vibe #crypto #BTC #ETH
103 2018-01-25 23:52:54 @CNBCFastMoney Who is picking your lineup?  You need some help.  You keep picking individuals that are in fact NOT respected or well thought of in the #Crypto community for a number of reasons.
104 2018-01-25 23:52:50 $BTC is not completely anonymous. I like Monero and Zcash long-term. $XMR is the most private but some may argue $ZEC uses the most advanced cryptography. $PIVX has a good pairing between privacy and usability. People want privacy and anonymity and these will continue to advance.

106 2018-01-25 23:52:47 中国の仮想通貨の規制についてですが、規制に関する立案の担当をされている方が、良いICO projectは規制せずに支援をしていくという立ち位置のようですね。詐欺まがいのICOを弾くためにはルールがいるんでしょうね。
107 2018-01-25 23:52:46 This is very evident in many crypto currency communities. Tech to change the world filled with trolls who are trying to derail it.
108 2018-01-25 23:52:35 I'm actually starting to believe that as well. I feel like @WCXofficial is the exact same thing along with basically anything #TRON #tronix #TRONCOIN #trx related. Buyer beware in regards to both #exchanges and #cryptocurrency. Please be cautious! #Crypto #money #finance
109 2018-01-25 23:52:29 Yes, there is no doubt about it. I strongly feel "they" are doing it at exchanges directly...no doubt about it. Its not beneficial to do it for CME volume...but to create psycology they may do it again. 22-Dec was epic.

117 2018-01-25 23:50:55 finally a truthful crypto statement by you
118 2018-01-25 23:50:49 I thought the whole point of crypto was to avoid nosey bullshit.
119 2018-01-25 23:50:40 Let me double check.
120 2018-01-25 23:50:37 You are smart
121 2018-01-25 23:50:31 When I was a youngin (90's) .29 cents could buy you a cheeseburger. In 2018 nickel and dimes are practically useless. Inflation of the US dollar won't stop. Printing money is not the answer. #crypto is the answer.
122 2018-01-25 23:50:21 شكرا على ردك السريع في موقع اسمه exmo شو رأيك فيه
123 2018-01-25 23:50:17 Or crypto disappears from the media and they move on to the next thing
124 2018-01-25 23:50:13 Definitely! More bubbles will be burst, more gov bans will be imposed, more bad news will be appeared against crypto currencies. But who cares? Crypto currencies will remain until the end of Internet or at least someone invent something else which is much advance than current CC.
125 2018-01-25 23:50:12 Now you’re getting it
126 2018-01-25 23:50:00 3 ways to make money of a $BTC dump 

- sell high buy low repeat
- place low buy orders on $Alts and BTFD
- margin short $BTC

132 2018-01-25 23:49:39 Better stock up on candles and buy horses with our crypto-earnings now Food and things you can hold and touch will be of great value in those times my friend.

134 2018-01-25 23:49:34 haha it was crypto humor. Im fine with Trx being successful I have several family members and friends hodling.
135 2018-01-25 23:49:32 Also, why would $ECA be a fraud/scam you’re claiming it to be, when they’re fulfilling what they promised on their roadmap for Q1. Wouldn’t they just stop if they already robbed you? I lowkey hope coinsmarkets stole your coins cause you don’t belong in crypto. They probably didnt

153 2018-01-25 23:47:57 If Jed leaves Stellar, that is the time to buy, look how much it helped Ripple. ;)

157 2018-01-25 23:47:36 Value is a subjective thing and its value is determined by the community who involved with it. So if you say crypto currency has no any intrinsic value then similarly USD also has no any intrinsic value. But was it a problem? Absolutely not at all.
158 2018-01-25 23:47:24 I think of myself as mature, but I dont think I could contain myself if I saw him. Its either a light-hearted bitconnnnnneeect or a hate filled lecture on how leeching on the less intelligent for a large sum of cash is BS.

160 2018-01-25 23:47:05 Crypto has taken over the role. Forks and what not.
161 2018-01-25 23:47:04 Btc is going to be $1000. Let remove anchoring altcoin’s price on BTB’s price. Crypto exchanges are doing stupid work when sell many coins as ETH, XLM, XRP, zcash, dash, Monero through BTC. That is a stupid ring of trading. Btc can kill coin market.
162 2018-01-25 23:46:57 Nu zijn altcoins te veel gekoppeld aan Bitcoin. Af en toe springt er eens wat uit de dans, maar that’s it. Ik denk/hoop dat op termijn de achterhaalde Bitcoin vervangen wordt als nr.1 door een ander, maar welke?? Zal m.i. gaan met veel schudding; koersval van 95% kan dan zomaar..
163 2018-01-25 23:46:39 What about $ICX still one of your bags?
164 2018-01-25 23:46:36 Who else is excited that robinhood is now trading crypto

185 2018-01-25 23:45:14 If you watch @CNBCFastMoney for some laughs when they cover crypto, then I get it. Otherwise don't waste your time. If I was on set there, I would be embarrased by the content being put out.

186 2018-01-25 23:45:00 when a crypto coin promotes a tweet to find unsuspecting victims
187 2018-01-25 23:44:42 We'll the entire crypto space has been in the red for the last couple of days so of course the lending coins are going to get hit hard naturally
188 2018-01-25 23:44:32 I called him out on a post in front of a big crypto name and he got all shy and tried blowing it saying “I said you’ll get it after 500 retweet’s” or some bs like that and then blocked me. He’s a joke. Doesn’t really seem to know what he’s talking about either lol
189 2018-01-25 23:44:20 I'm pretty possitive @CNBCFastMoney choses the worst people to promote $BTC on purpose. All part of their agenda to take down crypto.
190 2018-01-25 23:44:18 Pay attention to #TRON #TRX on the 4 hr chart, if it closes another green candle AND volume increases, its a good buy.

192 2018-01-25 23:44:16 Some of the personalities here in crypto twiter, hiding their faces behind a funky meme picture have more common sense than most of the "professionals" that are supposed to deliver information to us.
They are not biased. Simple...
193 2018-01-25 23:44:15 allllso we have a 4.0clearnet branch for exchanges and pools that don't want tor running

196 2018-01-25 23:43:45 So painful to watch @CNBCFastMoney talk crypto like they've been here the whole time. I almost feel sorry for the noobs that listen to this god awful advice from whomever that woman is and this (self declared{?}) "oracle"
197 2018-01-25 23:43:45 Crypto?
198 2018-01-25 23:43:41 Serious question for the crypto currency crowd.  How would I ever be able to adopt one of these coins when it takes LITERALLY ages to verify/confirm a transaction.
199 2018-01-25 23:43:37 @Ali_Nejad Anyone taking bets on what time the first crypto currency discussion will start!
200 2018-01-25 23:43:36 Why attack when prices are still low?
201 2018-01-25 23:43:34 CNBC= Certainly Never Buying Crypto
202 2018-01-25 23:43:31 Kind of a catch in that you can only transfer $1000 instantly from your bank acc. In order to increase this you have to subscribe to the gold membership. I don’t know how they’ll factor this in with crypto when trading starts next month.
203 2018-01-25 23:43:23 Exactly! I have been arguing for the respect of cryptography all day. Bro dudes keep telling me to let it go. They all want to call cryptocurrency crypto. It is infuriating.
204 2018-01-25 23:43:22 I'm sure that page will update soon
205 2018-01-25 23:43:14 If you are hung up on whether crypto can become a replacement for the dollar, then you don't understand the market.
206 2018-01-25 23:43:14 Finally got in too 
207 2018-01-25 23:43:10 @RobinhoodApp started with free stock trading app then free option trading and now free trading for hot crypto.. amazing.. @coinbase watch out..#Freecryptotrading
208 2018-01-25 23:43:03 false, this will add fiat liquidity. lol you're the best contrarian indicator of when i should buy more crypto
209 2018-01-25 23:43:03 they are on the correct block though, I've spoken to them several times before during and after, like I said.
210 2018-01-25 23:42:50 Don’t chase rallies after they’ve started, I see it happen way too often in #crypto. By the time you get in, most of the upside is gone, or worse you buy at the top. Instead treat it like a chess game, position your pieces strategically, and lay in wait for next strong move up.
211 2018-01-25 23:42:49 Also, Robinhood has ZERO fees on crypto purchases (compared to @coinbase fees of 1.5% + 4%).

Bullish.

212 2018-01-25 23:42:38 I'd love to have more data on bitcoin/crypto buyers because its fascinating from a sociological and economic perspective, but this data is from SurveyMonkey? Seems like its not too reliable.
213 2018-01-25 23:42:34 All $SBUX has to do now is mention some kind of crypto and stock will be  up 100%. Just look at $KODK. Revenues, margins etc don’t mean a thing anymore
214 2018-01-25 23:42:30 2018 goal: Chart everything. Maybe share some charts on Twitter.
215 2018-01-25 23:42:26 Yeah, and a lot of that blame rests on @CNBCFastMoney. They sure told their base when to but $xrp... Which isn't even a crypto but that's not my point.
216 2018-01-25 23:42:26 @RobinhoodApp just announced its move into Crypto, best news ever!!!!
217 2018-01-25 23:42:16  just fucking this him, let him refresh and wait for the transaction. 
218 2018-01-25 23:41:59 @RobinhoodApp about to take over the crypto world. They already have the user and they're established. Plus their UX looks sexy af. It's over.
219 2018-01-25 23:41:50 But you can't send your coins out of the app? No way.

226 2018-01-25 23:40:41 The creation isn’t transparent because nobody knows if there is real money backing it or if it was created from nothing and simply injected into the crypto markets to simulate buying volume. I dispute this is harder than the alternative (injecting 100M real USD).

240 2018-01-25 23:39:30 @RobinhoodApp makes money from uninvested cash balances and premium memberships that allow margin trading. I hope their business model stays the same after the crypto rollout.

Also crypto people you don’t need to post something useless every 15 mins.
243 2018-01-25 23:39:15 細かい額のビットコインを大量に受け取っていると（例えば，1時間ごとに自動受信する形のハイプで）「過去に受信した多くの小規模な決済を統合する必要」のために，送金手数料があとで多額になる可能性があるような気がします。
244 2018-01-25 23:39:10 Oh thanks! Hoping we can get 20-30 for the first meetup and grow from there.
245 2018-01-25 23:38:59 It's a dilemma right? Everyone is saying they should not sell the bottom... But at the same time it's ripple so they should get out while they can 
246 2018-01-25 23:38:46 Accept Crypto and I will eat your nasty food.
247 2018-01-25 23:38:40 It will be crazy if $SEN just announce that airdrop exhausted all available SEN, that was ICO and there’s only mine and trade option now
248 2018-01-25 23:38:33 Why do the media keeps reaching to the worst people in crypto for information?
249 2018-01-25 23:38:32 You do the presentation then, and we'll show the power of crypto economics and pay for you to attend as your sponsor ;)
250 2018-01-25 23:38:27 The problem is that most crypto's are not designed for use with banks, most are even "anti-bank".

Ripple ($XRP )'s main use case is for bank...
251 2018-01-25 23:38:17 Tous ceux qui ont fait du trading de Forex savent que c'est impossible ! Maintenant il faut trouver les frais cachés... Je parie sur le niveau de spread!
252 2018-01-25 23:38:07 I really think we’ve seen the last of sub 9k unless there is a massive scaling issue (outside of what is being done) or security items that hit hard along with crime, theft and regulations. Pretty tough to get those stars aligned but who knows
253 2018-01-25 23:37:30 I'm new to this since November, I have learned very fast as crypto has a learning curve relative to the price fluctuation......bought TRX at 3 cents...should have sold at 30 cents....didnt know at the time, same as XRP at 3.65 when I'm in for 80 cents....
254 2018-01-25 23:37:16 Agreed...they think BTC=Bitconnect. Or may be intentional to poison people's minds.
255 2018-01-25 23:37:10 Super late, it'll be harder to make a quick flip now but it's still nice to have. I trust Robinhood, I don't think any Crypto will disappear like on there.
256 2018-01-25 23:37:03 Anyone going to buy the Lamborghini Urus with their $crypto gains? May be a slightly more practical lambo to chuck those #dogecoin profits in.
257 2018-01-25 23:36:58 god damn dude. I sure hope you are joking.
258 2018-01-25 23:36:57 After losing a lot over the course of several dumps, I've finally started to (1) set obscenely low bids on coins I've been swooning over and then (2) turn off my monitor.  Fear is a liar.

260 2018-01-25 23:36:53 It’s not that AM banks are just ignoring crypto, they have systems that are pretty efficient as is, so they’ll be the last to adopt. The corridors in Southeast Asia and corridors similar, are the ones due to benefit the most off this. Regulations play a huge role as well.

266 2018-01-25 23:36:29 Exactly, always keep things in perspective and filter them through a skeptical discerning eye. The MSM spread mis-information, and sells ads through fear and a sense of urgency.  They are the ultimate masters of the game, and are opinion makers, not disseminaters of facts. #Truth

287 2018-01-25 23:34:31 70% of my $crypto portfolio is made up of PoS/DPoS coins.  Why? Well, not only do I like free shit, but there's typically a smaller percentage of the total circulating supply on exchanges versus PoW coins because they're tied up in a wallet for staking.

293 2018-01-25 23:34:09 They already ”lost” lots of tokens for foreigners in some of the best projects in crypto. This ICO ban is absurd and once all markets are free in China again - O’boy the prices when they hunt back their ELA & co.
294 2018-01-25 23:34:03 Crypto coming to robinhood is the best news I've heard in a while. This happened WAY faster than I expected. Crypto is the future whether you like it or not!!!
295 2018-01-25 23:33:56 @coinbase  is there a reason why you have no intention to add XRP to your portfolio of crypto's
296 2018-01-25 23:33:52 I think @CNBCFastMoney is frantically pouring over $crypto twitter, desperate, knowing they're behind the curve.

To survive here you need to have a healthy appetite for sarcasm; their "Social Media Analysts" don't seem to "get it."

305 2018-01-25 23:33:10 By doing this, you no longer have to sift thru your entire Twitter feed to see just gardening tweets or crypto currency tweets or what ever your interests may be.
306 2018-01-25 23:33:09 "Bitcoin Jesus", "Crypto Oracle", and y'all haven't spoken with the Shitcoin Sherpa? Gotta step up your game, folks. You have about a thousand more ego-stroking nom de guerres to work through.

311 2018-01-25 23:32:56 hmm... a payments CEO on Airbnb's Board.  I smell CRYPTO!!
312 2018-01-25 23:32:52 But there IS a difference between public equities and crypto.
313 2018-01-25 23:32:45 Have been to a few different crypto meet ups and Hayden delivered an interesting and insightful presentation. Looking forward to more of the same. Thanks Hayden.

317 2018-01-25 23:32:17 @binance_2017 I'm not getting my sms authentication text? Is there a system wide issue or am I the only one?
318 2018-01-25 23:32:09 I actually accidentally made $400 literally overnight. Client paid me in crypto at night and didn't tell me until morning. By the time I checked my crypto wallet, the amount had gone up. Could have gone the other way too. Used the "extra" to attend a crypto conference. :)
319 2018-01-25 23:31:40 Vinny and his advice has been the running joke of crypto for many many years now.  Now he is pushing #Bcash with Roger and the #Fakesatoshi.  Laughable.

323 2018-01-25 23:31:10 What's the difference between a crypto miner and a plumber?
A plumber can at least solve a bock...
(awful I know haha)
324 2018-01-25 23:31:07 Same here in Slovenia no crypto income tax for traders but crypto mining is taxed from the beginning.
But ofc they are working overtime to pass the legislation to tax us in the future.
325 2018-01-25 23:31:05 People are afraid of $COB @COBINHOOD (similar name/ added value to @RobinhoodApp ) my quess is that there will be no big conflict. Different markets, different activities. I will use $COB dip to buy much more! It is just sign that @COBINHOOD is worthy !

350 2018-01-25 23:28:13 Evening Thoughts.... In a world of trader apathy, cryptos remain the one product which Millennials are excited and fascinate by, and the rush to grab - and steal - market share for the most active retail trading segment is only just starting.

387 2018-01-25 23:25:26 You may have underestimated the popularity of doge in China.
388 2018-01-25 23:25:16 Or just margin trade that dump for lambo

409 2018-01-25 23:24:06 Actually. I'd say women should not consider crypto. Men are being super dumb with that and someone has to be smart and responsible in these crazy times
410 2018-01-25 23:24:02 Classic game theory. Polarization can’t exist forever. On this track, the ultimate end game, bubble or not, is persuading society to believe crypto’s worth into existence.

438 2018-01-25 23:22:01 The $XRP FUD is just getting boring now. It used to be that they would hate $XRP because it's a "bankers coin", now they claim it's a coin the banks will never use lol. Make up your damn mind. #xrpthestandard #xrp #ripple #bitcoin #crypto

447 2018-01-25 23:21:38 You are entitled to your opinion but I disagree with you.  While bitcoin may have climbed too quickly because of futures, I think long term it's still bullish.  Ultimately, we will have to see how markets react but in my opinion, I see new all time highs by Spring 2018.

461 2018-01-25 23:20:55 There are a lot of so called “crypto experts” all of a sudden . I take all they say as opinions and use them as a base to do my own research i.e that’s if you don’t know where to start. Dont believe what anyone says and only invest what you can lose!
462 2018-01-25 23:20:54 And they are. 2.1 billion. Small relative to crypto. Hence ppl argue the systemic risk posed is nonexistent or small

504 2018-01-25 23:18:04 From what I gathered it’s crypto currency developed under an unknown person or persons that was developed to pay people that did nodes or coding but it expanded to a wider market. I just don’t get how it’s used

524 2018-01-25 23:15:45 Good work. My only comment is that encryption is getting baked into everything; question is whether that crypto is managed or left unmanaged. This is a positive shift because those options need to be ready for use, but result is lots of quibbling over correct implementation.

597 2018-01-25 23:08:24 Lol. Yeah what I meant by drawbacks were more platform based..such as inability to short, wack exchange prices etc. Serious stock traders don't use Robin Hood for a variety of reasons..so what are those reasons for crypto?

602 2018-01-25 23:07:54 The "protocol" they will use is polymorphic. Crypto is an ecosystem of protocols, that makes it antifragile. Every maximalists are wrong, and "xrp the standard" is clearly not happening soon. (Never)

621 2018-01-25 23:04:50 Ok, let's stop the tribal crypto mudslinging for now, I don't mind jokes & witty banter but this is turning in to a toxic cesspit. It's like r/cryptocurrency subreddit. Lol,  come on let's not give crypto a bad name. Let's focus our energy on our own projects & not each other.
622 2018-01-25 23:04:25 Vinny is the Chris Roberts of crypto. Feasting on past success, never delivered since.
623 2018-01-25 23:04:25 Why is there a secret ride?
624 2018-01-25 23:04:19 @RobinhoodApp @AskRobinhood I received the email after signing up for crypto access, when i clicked on refer friends, it linked me back into the app, but didn't prompt me with anything. 

Will the standard invite code refer people into the crypto list as well?
625 2018-01-25 23:03:55 You’re the best on YouTube, by far, in the crypto space.  Will patiently await
626 2018-01-25 23:03:51 @RobinhoodApp would absolutely love to see $LTC on your new crypto trading platform. Probably won't use it until you do to be honest.
627 2018-01-25 23:03:45 Litecoin est maintenant sur @zebpay une très grosse plateforme d’échange basé en Inde!
628 2018-01-25 23:03:34 I didn't go back
629 2018-01-25 23:03:24 Hey man I’m new to crypto I put everything I have into trx at seven cents what can we be looking forward to in 2018? I would love a response.

635 2018-01-25 23:02:28 Yea, the editor does not up from down likely so it’s likely some random “expert” crypto intern.
636 2018-01-25 23:02:28 Dump it before the Ripple insiders dump more.
637 2018-01-25 23:02:26 oh I wasn't trying to be racist coz I am asian too, and fresh off the boat :D
638 2018-01-25 23:02:22 Adds will make noobs buy it. When it is listed you can buy half of ICO price I suppose.
639 2018-01-25 23:02:16 I spend about 2 to 4 hours everyday reading/researching about all things blockchain/crypto, but the most interesting part of my day is reading @officialmcafee tweets and replies. Not sure how you have the time but keep it up!
640 2018-01-25 23:02:13 @RobinhoodApp Is adding crypto into their amazing platforn with no fees for buying and selling along side trading with stocks. Best News ever.
641 2018-01-25 23:02:12 Big things to check out in the next few weeks. Please see below!

644 2018-01-25 23:01:45 Appearently it's January 26 at 3pm London time. So around 10am EST. If the price would drop it should already be happening now since it's only 15 hours from now.
645 2018-01-25 23:01:42 Growing up I performed my own crypto currencyBuy it in your life pass you by.
646 2018-01-25 23:01:40 You should have mentioned Neo in my opinion. As soon as China joins our crypto family Neo will reach top3 pretty easily and maybe even surpass Ethereum. They even could without China coming back.

648 2018-01-25 23:01:34 Hi, my Ether withdrawal has been pending since Dec. 20. Can you give me an update? Please and thank you.
649 2018-01-25 23:01:34 Crypto Gen: Obliterating the bs of the previous 4.
650 2018-01-25 23:01:33 So, I really like SiaCoin's tech / devs vision that I was willing to take the risk on their ASIC presale. We got burned by Bitmain. Yeah I hold BTC/LTC. Any good community sites you recommend?
651 2018-01-25 23:01:27 Instead all they do is disrespect the years of trials and tribulations the crypto industry has endured to arrive where it is today. At this point, if individuals are naive enough to listen to them, then I’ll gladly take their money in the market 
652 2018-01-25 23:01:15 Do I, as a normal dollar currency user, need to be worried about crypto like srsly
653 2018-01-25 23:01:15 Rearranged Friday to Sunday to be a crypto crew weekend...lots of chart monitoring and finger ready to press if needed with plenty of good food to watch bitcoin finale!! And make some savage moves 
654 2018-01-25 23:00:59 ICON mainnet 1.0 launched, ICX wallet due out shortly...
655 2018-01-25 23:00:52 I'm sure not involved. Amazon gift cards are really easy to buy as a company to reward users (they have a special service I worked with for two years. I distributed amazon gift cards to half a million app users in France btw)
656 2018-01-25 23:00:47 What happened to the moon xvg?
657 2018-01-25 23:00:46 .@RobinhoodApp supporting crypto huge 1) Brings established customer base to compete with @coinbase 2)New users sitting on the sidelines jump in based on reputation for near real-time trades 3)Millennials gauge investment in stocks vs crypto on return+dopamine-inducing volatility
658 2018-01-25 23:00:38 I’ve sat & watched this happen over & over again. And i finally took some time (hours-days-weeks) to research the uses for these crypto currencies. That just confirmed the reality of the situation for me.
659 2018-01-25 23:00:38 We are not infringing any intellectual property, bitcoin is not trademarked and there are many succesful crypto currencies on the market with the bitcoin name that are not associated with it.
660 2018-01-25 23:00:38 HODEL
661 2018-01-25 23:00:35 I watched it. You were marvelous I won't be touching any of those shitcoins though. Us poorer investors need moons and lambos at every week, not once in a might or might not happen Ahem (cough) x currency

664 2018-01-25 23:00:21 You realize that the “rich world country” would need to enter crypto before they could sell it, right ?
665 2018-01-25 23:00:20 That's unfortunate for them. Pretty stupid as well when you have to pay over 5 BTC for listing then u get de-listed. Oh well

669 2018-01-25 22:59:59 How high do you think it’ll go by mid February?
670 2018-01-25 22:59:53 $IFXY seems to be a nice play.  Crypto ICO company that just completed merger and new ticker and info on the way next week.
671 2018-01-25 22:59:46 Can you let me know what you think of #ELIX please!
672 2018-01-25 22:59:40 You just gave me the best news in days. We were chatting who would be the next competition for @coinbase just a month ago. Happened much faster than I expected. Competition will make crypto so much healthier. I just we see many more to come.
673 2018-01-25 22:59:32 2018 is the year of crypto.
674 2018-01-25 22:59:31 Only BTC and ETH will be available at launch. Only 5 states will be able to buy crypto from Robinhood.
675 2018-01-25 22:59:26 @RobinhoodApp                                         Ok, how is the new crypto going to work?? I got the email about it but don’t see anything on the app to see the market?

680 2018-01-25 22:59:07 Having like millions and millions... Not good to crypto... Lol

682 2018-01-25 22:58:59 The stolen hacks of 4 million also happened because of a wallet which has probably the worst usability in the whole crypto industry.

684 2018-01-25 22:58:37 @AskRobinhood Ok, how is the new crypto going to work?? I got the email about it but don’t see anything on the app to see the market?
685 2018-01-25 22:58:37 What if $SNAP goes crypto, you never know!
686 2018-01-25 22:58:34 you should see what Soros said about Bitcoin in Davos today... they all really feel personally disrespected by crypto lol
687 2018-01-25 22:58:32 I need to work for a law firm focusing on crypto...I need to be in the legal portion of this space.
688 2018-01-25 22:58:16 U ever see somebody make so much money that it makes u sick...like physically sick  that’s what happening in this crypto community.
689 2018-01-25 22:58:04 How often do they come in if I can ask, mine shud be matured few more days
690 2018-01-25 22:57:47 I am actually not a fan and I have never owned a collectible. I do acknowledge their appeal to people, and I’m sure the etherlambos idea was born out of the crypto kitties succes /1
691 2018-01-25 22:57:40 I think the only thing I'd purchase with Crypto would be a garage with a lift + tools $BTC
692 2018-01-25 22:57:39 The stakes still coming in?
693 2018-01-25 22:57:33 Exactly
694 2018-01-25 22:57:30 Done m8
695 2018-01-25 22:57:09 Yes it is
696 2018-01-25 22:56:56 Seems like just another platform where we can get charged to buy crypto. @Ethos_io  will end  this shit.
697 2018-01-25 22:56:46 After being in the crypto space since 2014 I have finally made a twitter. Lol showing up late to the party. #cryptocurrencies #showmethetwitterways
698 2018-01-25 22:56:44 Is the WoW token the new crypto currency?
699 2018-01-25 22:56:44 bitcoin has survived corrections because it was just people selling and taking profit. now it can officially be shorted with hundreds of millions of dollars. again, game over. its now a 2 way market and people are finally understanding how financial trading works
700 2018-01-25 22:56:38 Well put. I'm not disagreeing with you. I'm just simply saying anybody that trades crypto currency should already know about this. It's been a well known topic in the crypto community for months
701 2018-01-25 22:56:19 I paid for @CryptoChoe spread sheet. #awesome! Eric gives and gives. 50 USD is spare change if u like crypto. You may not get 10x magic, but you will be inspired. You will see YOUR picks on his lists. That makes you realize you're learning. #wisdom #growth
702 2018-01-25 22:56:09 when you roll out Robinhood Australia, will this crypto platform be available as well?

708 2018-01-25 22:55:54 because they will make  a SHITLOAD of money before the lights are officially shut off. you just said it more than anything. they love money. what do you not understand about this? bitcoin went from 5k to 20k because these futures were getting listed. made no sense.
709 2018-01-25 22:55:52 B/c of crypto I@ gonna check out @RobinhoodApp its a symbiotic relationship as they say.

I am already up for good quality discussios. Really few people are bringing good topics on the table to discuss. So I appreciate your contribution.
712 2018-01-25 22:55:42 @CryptoChoe Can you explain how your premium membership works?  If we sign up do we get daily updates?  Buy/Sell signals?

724 2018-01-25 22:53:50 It is open market. They can ask. It's up to you to buy. I wouldn't call it unethical. Unethical is when they lie and don't keep their promises .
725 2018-01-25 22:53:32 They'll just make a faster system than what they have, completely centralized, and slap a blockchain or crypto sticker on it. They won't be using a "decentralized" solution I can tell you that.
726 2018-01-25 22:53:30 Ok I need a Cryptocurrency Advocate/Expert? Why is Crypto a good investment? Why should people invest in it? Help a brother out....
727 2018-01-25 22:53:22 About as useless as Blue Baboon Poon
728 2018-01-25 22:53:19 I like crypto, but in no way will it replace money, lol. It’s the block chain technology that has value. No bank or country would ever allow a crypto to replace its currency. Plus you can’t pay taxes in bitcoin
729 2018-01-25 22:53:15 Silly regulators. Your rules will mean nothing after society collapses and all that's left is the crypto-singularity.
730 2018-01-25 22:53:13 That typo won’t change the fact that crypto is taking over & soon you will see it EVERYWHERE.
731 2018-01-25 22:52:58 It wasn't America driving the speculation a month ago. It was asia. And yes, American banks still see crypto as the enemy but as we can see from SBIRipple, Asia IS embracing. Down the line if it works and saves huge money do you really think AM banks will be able to ignore?
732 2018-01-25 22:52:54 @RobinhoodApp @COBINHOOD do not fight with each other! Synergy is the key! It could be win-win case!

737 2018-01-25 22:52:26 My favorite is xvg !!!
738 2018-01-25 22:52:20 Is this guy and CNBC serious? Buy BCASH and sell Litecoin? If they're going to talk about crypto, they should get someone on who actually knows what they're talking about. This same goes for the interviewers.
739 2018-01-25 22:52:19 His friends explains his stupidity,  the whiny @SethAbramson who is posting about censuring free speech and  @ryan_scott  a #ICO "shiller".   People who want to limit free speech probably don't censorship proof #Bitcoin
740 2018-01-25 22:51:54 Simple. Tell me what you think Dash does best in any single crypto-use-case, and I'll tell you which one does it better (and cheaper).
741 2018-01-25 22:51:53 Tokia is another copy paste project. No tech guys in Dev. Team. Greedy 50m$  hardcap.  nothing original.
742 2018-01-25 22:51:51 For every buck ltc jumps I get $25 bucks! I'm just a guy having fun with this. For every penny ripple moves it's a it's $350 swing one way or the other. Trading crypto is stressful!

746 2018-01-25 22:51:38 Looool so the club I support just signed a business deal with a crypto currency company (Cashbet Coin). Gotta love the @Arsenal, proper banter 
747 2018-01-25 22:51:34 #crypto! Better than soap operas!
748 2018-01-25 22:51:33 That got sad quick 
749 2018-01-25 22:51:31 Who is excited that @RobinhoodApp is going to start allowing #cryptocurrency trading? 

$BTC and $ETH first ... oh ... also no fees.
750 2018-01-25 22:51:30 That's nonsensical. Market cap is a frivolous metric in crypto, despite its ubiquity. Demand meeting supply determines price. We're talking about the demand for moving quadrillions of dollars. 100 billion supply might be peanuts for that.
751 2018-01-25 22:51:29 ADA
752 2018-01-25 22:51:16 Do you think that the time of "easy money" is now over for the crypto market because of futures and institutional money?
753 2018-01-25 22:51:06 Cheers Ronnie, that's dope 
754 2018-01-25 22:50:56 Well, I believe Bitstamp has this right. But now my crypto balances will be converted to euros before sending back. Why can't those be sent as cryptos? Costs will be withheld. No ETA when the refund will be made was given.
755 2018-01-25 22:50:54 Lol true! Likewise. Good luck to you.
756 2018-01-25 22:50:54 I really wish a respected name in #crypto would provide a clear and direct review of $trx all I see are subliminals. I don't understand the silence. @WhalePanda @SatoshiLite @fluffypony @VinnyLingham @francispouliot_

No disrespect meant! I just would love to hear your opinion.
757 2018-01-25 22:50:48 There needs to be a crunch base for crypto projets and OG's, not traders, but protocol level devs and industry people
758 2018-01-25 22:50:46 SAME. It genuinely hurts my ears.
759 2018-01-25 22:50:34 I have literally had over 100k in crypto and went to the pawn shop at one point cuz I didn't want to pull out my coin. Lol my girl was like wtf are u doing
760 2018-01-25 22:50:34 Free option trades and free crypto trades! This will end well. NOT! Yeah I brought back NOT.
761 2018-01-25 22:50:27 Jeff, I am new to Crypto but I watch ur YouTube videos daily and have learned so much. Started 3 months ago buying BTC only but now am in AST, TEL, and a couple other alt coins. Thanks for the work u do!!
762 2018-01-25 22:50:27 When will crypto be sold on robin hood
763 2018-01-25 22:50:18 I bet they do this shit on purpose lol like what headline will really stir up crypto twitter and make them talk about us  brilliant CNBC
764 2018-01-25 22:49:58 Please be honest, would you really spend your #bitcoin or other crypto currencies on goods and services?

765 2018-01-25 22:49:47 It will be the greatest tweet about crypto of all time.  Really great.  Just super and great and terrific.  Everyone will love it.  Believe me.
766 2018-01-25 22:49:44 Hey guess what. "Crypto" also means cryptocurrency in certain contexts.  It's a new usage. Deal with it.

776 2018-01-25 22:49:03 XRBの特徴は、送金の速さと、送金コスト無料である事。

世界の人口の半分が1日$2未満で、生活していると言われている。また、インフレに苦しむ国では自国通貨の価値が日々下がっている。

この状況下、XRBは世界を変えるゲームチェンジヤーに成り得ると思っている。

780 2018-01-25 22:48:45 IOTA is at the moment working in Partnership with some of the biggest companies in the world were the tech can be implemented. We are by far the crypto with more partnerships. Think VW group ( Porsche, Audi, Bugatti,Lamborghini...)but the FUD is high against us.

788 2018-01-25 22:48:22 I believe in the rise of crypto currency with all of my heart.
789 2018-01-25 22:48:13 Crypto is the best industry to work in because you are basically only limited by your imagination and drive. 

The people are so smart, and the technologies themselves are equally as impressive. 

You should join us; give us your best work. The world will thank you.
790 2018-01-25 22:48:03 How do we get that?
791 2018-01-25 22:47:40 Life in Crypto is like a shitty carnival ride. Sometimes you puke in your lap on the tilt-a-whirl and sometimes you get a blowjob behind the fried dough tent.

797 2018-01-25 22:47:22 It's the combination of timing (funds that I can invest / technology becoming more available) and opportunities (blockchain is the future / digital currency is getting more and more into daily life (everyone has visa, maestro,...) and of course, balls (dare to invest)

803 2018-01-25 22:47:02 Last 2 years made a lot of people rich via ICO and crypto investments. Some were lucky and others were and are smart. Now! Most ICOs are exit scams or pump and dumps. There is still big money here but people need to educate themselves and stop trusting youtube advisors.
804 2018-01-25 22:47:02 Are you really in crypto because of the tech? Or...
Are you more.... shoooowww me the moneyyyyy?

Test: Are you using the BAT browser Brave? If not you might be in crypto for the wrong reasons. Not only is this browser faster, it is also add free and blocks trackers! 
805 2018-01-25 22:47:01 Lol because I just feel it won’t drop that low.
806 2018-01-25 22:47:00 Wondering why @ColossusCoinXT hasn’t been listed on @YobitExchange after they paid .5 BTC for a listing within 2-3 business days. Seems like many exchanges can’t keep up with recent volume. #COLX

810 2018-01-25 22:46:53 I had a zen moment today as a crypto trader. The ups and downs of price are just a reflection of how you feel about yourself. How the outside world looks at you, and how that affects your decisions.
811 2018-01-25 22:46:40 Every use case in Crypto has a best-in-class and a new up-and-comer. What is Dash supposed to be best－in－class at?
812 2018-01-25 22:46:26 Was not in crypto when u did this... Please do it again!!!

814 2018-01-25 22:46:14 Oh, no wisdom, DYOR, haha.  In my mind if there are no more sellers the whales will have to either take out stop losses (driving the price lower), or let it rise to as you say "force more action"
815 2018-01-25 22:46:06 Can I pay with crypto currency?

If you do not have this payment system set, I can organise it for you. 

Many clients may prefer to pay via crypto currency to remain anonymous.
816 2018-01-25 22:46:06 I previously heard good things about them as well.  He is right. Not much money needed to develop the tool. But yes money is needed for exchanges listing , marketing and business development. Which are crucial for financial products.

820 2018-01-25 22:45:32 In your opinion, what is the best way for a retail investor with very little experience in trading/investing to invest in crypto? Wait for ETFs? Indexes? Just invest in BTC/ETH, etc.? What do you think? Let's assume this is for those who are NOT accredited investors.

831 2018-01-25 22:44:52 Seriously ask yourself what the point of Dash will be when lightning network is implemented? Scaling in other altcoins is moving much faster than Dash, Privacy in other crypto is more developed, other alts are faster transacting, smart contracts etc.

I'm grateful for your generous follow!
839 2018-01-25 22:44:07 Interesting.  Thanks for bestowing a bit of wisdom.  So in theory, the whales will be forced to let the price rise a little to force more action, say from 10-12 cents?
840 2018-01-25 22:43:56 Noticeable trend: 

Whenever a crypto startup founder gets asked about the value of their token/ICO it inevitably turns into a discussion of "well what is money anyway?"
841 2018-01-25 22:43:52 Keep in mind that this is an extremely manipulated coin.  The whales could keep dropping it taking out stop losses, etc, but I see the indicators as a good sign long term.

856 2018-01-25 22:42:48 In my mind the dropping Volume is simply an indicator of sellers disappearing.  The lack of volume will put upward pressure on the whales to allow the price to rise, which will in turn raise the volume.  Many variables... Just looking at the indicators.
857 2018-01-25 22:42:46 It is advice man.  Of course he talking about market cap.

911 2018-01-25 22:38:00 What a move ! @RobinhoodApp into the #crypto market is the best in the recent times. #ethereum #bitcoin. @coinbase have to come up with new transaction fees now. Competitor is here 
912 2018-01-25 22:37:48 Can you do this with BTC? 0.00000001 BCH @tipprbot

915 2018-01-25 22:37:34 Robinhood and Square(Cash App), both with ZERO fees, are now in the crypto game to compete against Coinbase... #GameChanger #BYE

919 2018-01-25 22:37:12 Exactly. Crypto simply replaces / replicates the existing digital payments ecosystem. The tentacles of visa/mcard/apple/big banks et al, simply port their fee model into private/crypto hands. But behind a veneer of social/revolution, but gets cheerleader buyin due to “investment”
920 2018-01-25 22:36:59 Analytics cannot be applied to crypto.
921 2018-01-25 22:36:52 ازعاج  و جد خفت على معلومات البطاقة الي سجلتها يوم اشتريت منهم كيف موقع buy.bitcoin ? افضل؟
922 2018-01-25 22:36:47 Paiement par carte pas terrible niveau sécurité et je sais pas trop si c’est possible faut voir, moi je dirait pour la crypto vive les virements meme si c’est un peu long. 
923 2018-01-25 22:36:43 I completely agree with @losmanuel. If you guys want real educated assessments of crypto, go to @cryptochoe. The Crypto market went 6x in a month, so ya, even David can look like he knows what he is talking about in that kind of market.
924 2018-01-25 22:36:36 Sumone in the #crypto scene employ me plzz
925 2018-01-25 22:36:20 Honestly the whole bitcoin movement kinda reminds me of your dad.. I think collapsing the central banking system is something he would get behind. Is he into crypto yet?

927 2018-01-25 22:36:13 Why does #WannaCry #ransomware use different AES keys to encrypt different files on infected machine? Why not use just one to encrypt all files and protect that using public key crypto? Does it offer any strategic, cryptographic advantages to the attacker? Can someone tell me?
928 2018-01-25 22:36:11 Kinda disappointed it didn't pump yet...not gonna lie I'm trying to flip profits tonight with $zil

930 2018-01-25 22:36:00 I understand the rationale of reviewing crypto from a diff perspective. But you need to realise that:
1. there are flaws in the methods that lead to several nonsenses;
2. This tentative will have deep negative impact on projects that are starting and will suffer from ur mistakes
931 2018-01-25 22:35:48 It's amazing, isn't it. This Mr. Coyle was once promoting cannabis stocks (where he lost an awful amount of money). Now he's all about crypto. Tesla is just a side bet I guess

942 2018-01-25 22:35:01 I avoided buying multiple scam tokens already. One company finished their OTC market pump and dump a year ago, just decided it was easy to get into crypto too. Also these scam tokens are really good at registering subreddits and controlling the conversation everywhere they can.

948 2018-01-25 22:34:36 It just shows how people in crypto are so immature. They want tremendous returns in matter of months ( Months??? Are u crazy!?? In matter of days/min!)! In fact no one cares about the purpose of the project or how it can contribute to blockchain space.
949 2018-01-25 22:34:36 A whale can hold the price anywhere they reasonably want, if no one is selling then their efforts are meaningless.  The lack of volume means less and less folks are willing to sell which means the whales will have to let the coin get back to a point where ppl are willing to sell

963 2018-01-25 22:32:54 Wallstreet loves money more than anything.  Why would they keep shorting bitcoin to drive it to the ground?  Bitcoin has always survived and once lightning network comes into play later in 2018, not even Wallstreet will be able to control it's growth potential

1067 2018-01-25 22:24:02 So you're OK with other people losing their money when it goes under? As long as you pulled a profit, it's cool? Gotcha. You are part of the problem.

1072 2018-01-25 22:23:16 It’s absolutely frightening how misinformed people are about these projects.  If Disney was actually involved in any way right now this would be the second biggest coin behind $btc and there would be a 5 year wait to release ICOs on it
1073 2018-01-25 22:23:09 VitalikButerin: My new favorite hobby: statistically "proving" that various very complicated theorems are likely to be true by assuming primes are randomly distributed across Z+ with N having 1/ln(N) chance of being prime. But be careful, this technique may sometimes mislead you!
1074 2018-01-25 22:23:05 Sorry. I been away from this music biz thing for a few days. Been all in with crypto currency and bitcoin.

1077 2018-01-25 22:22:58 What do you mean by crypto is “traded like commodities” vs. fiat? We trade in currency pairs, but the volatility is much higher because everyone is figuring out where value is really being created by this new tech.
1078 2018-01-25 22:22:51 We all go through this phase. You’ll come around. Bitcoin is the only crypto that matters. Cheers
1079 2018-01-25 22:22:50 It was going great til the crypto gurus voiced there opinion, this wasn't the time to let your followers know to be weary, this was a time of promotion like what was occurring yesterday

1081 2018-01-25 22:22:41 People get so salty and impatient about small delays on projects/updates in crypto. 

You guys do realize if the devs fuck it up you could lose all your coins or worse, right?

1089 2018-01-25 22:22:17 CBOE futures are a joke to the industry. we take the CME futures way more seriously. each contract is worth 5 bitcoins compare to 1 with CBOE. CME also uses a mix of 4 exchanges to get settle price instead of just Gemini for CBOE. this is going to happen every month. BTC is done

1108 2018-01-25 22:21:06 I would like to remind everyone that the coins with the most fud pop more than other coins simply because most crypto is over valued. If you believe in a project dont leave because its not doing as well as other coins, chances are the reason its not moving is because accumulation

1113 2018-01-25 22:20:34 Good call  those ads were legit and had solid quality of graphics, but I'm over here trying to collect me some Electroneum 
1114 2018-01-25 22:20:32 So, I’ll be honest. I really don’t know much about crypto. 
I get the general overall idea of the blochchain and so forth. But the exact details, not really.

1139 2018-01-25 22:19:11 Interesting. First time I heard about them was 3-4 years ago. Took a while to get into crypto. But they are still like coinbase - US only 
1140 2018-01-25 22:19:09 Attn: No Coiners.
No, you are NOT too late to the Crypto party.
We are still in the first inning.

Just dip your toes if you must.
$100 into coinbase and split it 4 ways.

1145 2018-01-25 22:18:48 Environmental impacts can be mitigated by utilizing other protocols besides proof of work (POW). Proof of stake and delegated proof of stake offer better alternatives in maintaining Blockchain networks at lower energy costs. Crypto can be adopted without doom the Earth.

1217 2018-01-25 22:12:05 @iambroots #cryptocurrency #pumpanddump I noticed alot of these crypto traders don't know what the hell there doing.Instead of buy, hold and gain a 100%+ profit in a day or so, they'd rather buy and sell as soon as it rises 5-10% . To really profit, you need at least $1K active

1221 2018-01-25 22:11:46 If you still think crypto currency is just a fad, you probably haven't talked to anyone under 60 for a while.
1222 2018-01-25 22:11:45 For far too long I sat on my coins waiting for the next 2x or ready to buy some dip. 

In recent weeks masternodes and staking have become so appealing, relaxing, and reassuring (as much as one can be in this space).

1223 2018-01-25 22:11:42 I totally agree. But at the first sign of a pullback new buyers tend to panic sell and exacerbate crashes.

1249 2018-01-25 22:09:29 Best of luck.  If it drops down a lot you might want to consider buying more to lower your average cost.
1250 2018-01-25 22:09:29 Andddd someone is publishing photos of dead bodies in the Binance community Telegram group. Just another lovely day in crypto.
1251 2018-01-25 22:09:27 It would be much easier to list what isn't on the 'crypto snake oil' list ... so this tweet seems invalid.

1255 2018-01-25 22:09:15 How’s that working for you - Didn’t you just buy a place anyway!?

I went to see a place this week that is an absolute building site but it’s a big family house with big garden... my #crypto gains were going to fund the work but 4 days later I was 55% lighter! 
1256 2018-01-25 22:09:12 Really Crypto Currency is here to stay
1257 2018-01-25 22:09:06 Charlie don't forget in that 1.3 Billion so far 1.3M people in India hardly know or hear about Crypto and 130k people might be interested in 1.3M and 13k people are actually involved in Crypto but one day more and more people will get to know, I am expecting 1.3M in near future
1258 2018-01-25 22:08:59 Right?! Its lite lite lite and not lite. I don't stoop low enough for any of them.
1259 2018-01-25 22:08:57 The only time u dnt need a @TREZOR wallet is when U invest with @GenesisMining & they ignore support tickets about missing payouts / failed payouts.

1285 2018-01-25 22:06:48 all over this count, great call. Looked over the whitepaper draft as well... everything looks so solid. See you on the mooooon 
1286 2018-01-25 22:06:46 I can agree with that!! Haha
1287 2018-01-25 22:06:27 The rate at which the algorithm allows $BTC to be mined halves. 

Current rate of $BTC mining per year is a little over 6k, after the halving that drops to a little over 3k.

1356 2018-01-25 22:00:45 You imply that crypto is socially inclusive, but it’s actually the opposite. Unless I subscribe, I can’t participate. But with cash, simple possession = participation = inclusion. So by simply gifting my grandma some cash, she’s an economic participant.

1379 2018-01-25 21:58:43 Hey crypto trading females—-follow me pls - I try to follow as many crypto-female traders as possible. They also hard to find. Collectively they have a tad of an edge Bc of their intuition. I blv that. It’s another legal edge to take note of IMHO n see another entirely diff side
1380 2018-01-25 21:58:33 Yes :(

1382 2018-01-25 21:58:00 They are from Britain however, you know how it is when you’re new and marketing especially in crypto anything goes it seems and you do whatever you can to pimp yourself so to speak.

1392 2018-01-25 21:57:28 $STK is gona smash out a lot of competitors in the space. Mastercard is virtually accepted everywhere in the world. This will bring mass adoption to crypto.
1393 2018-01-25 21:57:21 Can you drop a cryptos in a buskers hat, or buy a lemonade from a 5 yr olds stall, or provide payments solutions to remote communities with crypto?

1395 2018-01-25 21:57:18 IMO the more tumultuous the political environment, the higher the crypto values. 

For this we would have Donald Trump to thank, if my speculations prove correct.

1414 2018-01-25 21:55:49 Well, I guess those big banks don’t want to enlarge their profits.  What will be nice is that smaller banks and Credit Unions may not have to deal with the larger banks and third parties to send funds.  Believe me, they’ll get on board.

1433 2018-01-25 21:54:37 So I hear the forex advantage being used as the overriding justification for a singular global crypto currency. But in reality, forex isn’t a daily need that justifies crypto for most people. When you consider the implications for subscription, control, fees, connectivity etc.

1496 2018-01-25 21:47:49 True but when do you expect that to happen I feel like NEO is ready for the next wave and should put into there
1497 2018-01-25 21:47:41 Definitely the Bay area. I'm pretty sure it'll be San Jose, but might wanna ask @RealWorldCrypto
1498 2018-01-25 21:47:40 From what I understand @profitly shows verified earnings for traders who trade penny stocks and serves as proof of certain traders earnings. Is there such a thing for cryptos. And if so how many crypto traders would subscribe to such great transparency? Just wondering.
1499 2018-01-25 21:47:36 Why the hell are you even in crypto at the first place, if you think banks are the system we want to keep alive?
The are not needed, sure can keep existing, but defenitely not willing to give up their piece of the pie..with a bit faster and cheaper software

1507 2018-01-25 21:46:56 Nah man! It's a crypto altcoin. These guys are proud to see their vision become a reality and not worth 2¢.
1508 2018-01-25 21:46:56 This is madness! THIS IS CRYPTO!!!
1509 2018-01-25 21:46:53 Not sure to be honest. Never met her, tweeted a few months back then she blocked me and wanted to stop me starting a new business. Was all very weird and uncalled for.
1510 2018-01-25 21:46:48 Buy crypto.
1511 2018-01-25 21:46:44 OK but where is RSA?

1513 2018-01-25 21:46:34 Omg we gotta talk crypto soon
1514 2018-01-25 21:46:33 If there is a future for crypto it either has to
a) become widely accepted as a unit of exchange and be treated like a currency
b) be traded like gold as a sort of store of value that is uncorrelated to most other markets

1516 2018-01-25 21:46:25 I looked into them when they first got listed on Binance. Wasn’t a ton of info out on them at the time. What do you like about them?
1517 2018-01-25 21:46:14 I do follow and I know you like other crypto too.Sorry about the misunderstanding, I wasn't targeting you.
Those arguments I can understand. Personally,I'm very comfortable with that.
Let me tell you why.
1518 2018-01-25 21:46:12 Ok thanks
1519 2018-01-25 21:46:05 @RobinhoodApp pretty interested in your app to trade, buy and sell crypto currency in an easy way. When will it be available in Spain?
1520 2018-01-25 21:45:55 There is low volume in the crypto market in general. It has nothing to do with XVG. The coin is solid, it works as intended.
1521 2018-01-25 21:45:40 I care. so my actions spoke louder than words. GOLD, SILVER and CRYPTO
1522 2018-01-25 21:45:32 I sent 1150 including fee.

Help me please. I lost a lot in wrong crypto. 
Trx to the moon!
1523 2018-01-25 21:45:24 The recurring thought being, what if bitcoin isn't the bubble, but the needle. However for crypto currencies to succeed we need to believe in the rules of maths more than the rules that governments and central banks make and break #cryptocurrency #crypto #Bitcoin #BitcoinPrivate
1524 2018-01-25 21:45:20 Korea Financial Intelligence Unit (KFIU) created a task force to oversee cryptocurrency exchanges, to ensure they are compliant with regulations. Korea is taking it seriously! #Crypto #cryptocurrency #BTC #altcoins #Korea
1525 2018-01-25 21:45:18 Through a clever slight of hand, it turns out that the communists made State into God and were therefore really crypto-theists.
1526 2018-01-25 21:45:13 Make it cheaper, introduce your own crypto currency to make payment decentralised.
1527 2018-01-25 21:45:11 Zcash tax goes against crypto ethos, stop justifying it.
1528 2018-01-25 21:45:05 I'd even argue that crypto isn't being traded like most commodities because most commodity futures are also traded by producers and users for hedging purposes and have value driven by production and usage. Right now crypto is being driven purely by speculation.

2) don't invest in something you don't understand

1629 2018-01-25 21:36:24 I’ll be honest, this was an unexpected crossover of crypto twitter and screenwriting twitter

1640 2018-01-25 21:35:19 When people talk about how cryptocurrency is already a main stream thing, they are clearly living in their own fantasy. When I go grocery’s shopping in Berlin I see exactly zero adoption where you are able to pay with crypto. Never the less it is the future and only the beginning
1641 2018-01-25 21:35:19 Jason made a lot of bad calls over the years. Crypto is the only one where he is constantly being wrong about since 2011 but refuses to admit it.

1648 2018-01-25 21:34:43 Big things coming! @matrixainetwork released their tokens this morning. Will hit exchanges within a month... I think. Be on the lookout! #Crypto #CryptocurrencyNews

1650 2018-01-25 21:34:20 Nice @RobinhoodApp you do that the day I take all my money out of your platform. issue is you report to the IRS which is why crypto exists
1651 2018-01-25 21:34:13 I took profits in $iost. What are you doing?
1652 2018-01-25 21:34:04 Not livid, just disappointed.  You guys missed a huge opportunity to become the standard in the crypto world....

1655 2018-01-25 21:33:49 Can you send money to anyone in the world within minutes or seconds for virtually zero fees and with no third party? Can you make a decentralized unalterable title for your car or house? Can you make an escrow account without a third party? Crypto can do this and more. Read up.
1656 2018-01-25 21:33:49 Who is into crypto?
1657 2018-01-25 21:33:46 Smart move by #Coinbase  to get the top crypto as currency to be used - Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. Bitcoin core will be used as gold and volatility will wane down as BCH, and LTC take over daily transactions. I thought you would add in #Dash. But good selection thus far.
1658 2018-01-25 21:33:45 One simple way to #short the #crypto market is on the OKEX where you will find a #futures #trading component. It is an Asisn #cryptocurrency exchange so the UI needs getting used to but it is pretty good. #okex

followers hungry : nothing bad in it ? 

its a urge on both the ends , crypto hungry will follow also ..so its kind of vice verca you see ;)

1679 2018-01-25 21:32:20 I genuinely apologize that you are so incredibly aghast I posted about "crypto-bankruptcy" on Twitter. We are all just as vulnerable as @50cent to the same potential crypto demise.

1686 2018-01-25 21:31:54 1/ My take on Bitcoin this week
-#Davos; everyone hates ₿. Govs are look at it very closely(what ever that means)
-Senile E. May wants to have tea w/ Bitcoin CEO to make it stop.
-₿ txn fees plummeted 
-200+ #LightingNetwork Nodes in 8days
-@RobinhoodApp crypto-currency buying

1706 2018-01-25 21:29:31 Your 'anarchism' seems to be a state in which each individual ran around in the wild with no interaction, cooperation, or communication w any other person. No historical anarchist advocated for this, so it's unfair to reserve the def'n of 'anarchism' for only this 'pure' state.

1709 2018-01-25 21:29:02 Absolutely, and your correct, I know next to nothing about Bitcoin/crypto (nor do I want to). I'm happy and content making my $$ using options, no need or desire to search for another trading avenue.
1710 2018-01-25 21:29:00 one idea is to just set your budget and dollar cost average in. Buy a little every day and hold a chunk out to buy the dip. There is always a dip- always
1711 2018-01-25 21:28:37 I’m cool with paying @Coinbase 1.5% to let me control my crypto - it’s comparable to a ForEx fee in that regard
1712 2018-01-25 21:28:36 60% of my portfolio on Katy perry nails. Looks like @katyperry has better sense of crypto than most people out there, shilling just the white papers like $trx $Ada. Be smart and Invest on a working product guys. $btc $xlm $eth $xmr $ltc my best hodl coins.

1773 2018-01-25 21:22:46 For even language is based on some form of cooperation and agreement; we communicate through shared concepts/rules. So if an anarchist society had language, on your strict definition, it would seem to no longer be anarchism, but instead agorism. Your bar is impossibly 'pure'.
1774 2018-01-25 21:22:40 They all want in on crypto 
1775 2018-01-25 21:22:34 Ik zeg net, de koersvolatiliteit is het laagst bij de bitcoin, deze wordt met de jaren minder. Wat betreft je koersmanipulatie, de bitcoin valt op te delen in 8 decimalen. Schaarser betekent niet dat het makkelijker te manipuleren valt, dit is bij altcoins juist makkelijker.
1776 2018-01-25 21:22:33 No because I'm not paying money for a 'free' token to be released to me. A free token that's not listed on ANY markets or exchanges. Peddle your scam elsewhere.

1788 2018-01-25 21:21:37 Your "smart crypto friends"? Meaning devs? Or just some investor bros who missed the last run-up and want to buy the "next bitcoin". 

Cause they wrong. Bitcoin not a business. 

Or is the leader just going to keep changing based on marketing?

1789 2018-01-25 21:21:27 @elonmusk When’s your Crypto Currency going to be released?  I’ve got faith in everything else you’re doing, let me mine some Crypto for you.
1790 2018-01-25 21:21:22 I was reading a bit ago about The Pirate Bay making money by running a script that has visitors mining crypto and it occurred to me that anyone could do it.
1791 2018-01-25 21:21:22 Just ignore crypto Facebook altogether... Compared to that crypto Twitter is like the Mensa society.
1792 2018-01-25 21:21:18 @vgr Crypto will test a lot of my beliefs on Purists vs Pragmatists. Many projects have public 24-36 months roadmaps, based much more on purist vision than on realtime degree of maximal-interestingness. What do you think about this?
1793 2018-01-25 21:21:10 #Bitcoin, crypto, and blockchain are easily over 51% of the discussion here at @wef. Oh yeah. Bill Gates just walked by. He’s shorter than I thought.
1794 2018-01-25 21:21:09 I'm not personally involved in the project, but I'd love to hear the criticisms since security is not my area of expertise

1804 2018-01-25 21:20:17 Do you think it keeps growing?

1807 2018-01-25 21:19:46 Hope it keeps up the trend.
1808 2018-01-25 21:19:46 Alts is where its at. Especially with Pump Groups. Much more money to be made. We had a 92% gain on our pump a couple of hours ago.
1809 2018-01-25 21:19:38 Cardstack, it is not a simple word, it is an open-source that makes blockchains usable for the mass market. This is one of the most productive projects, that can bring use for all! Very good and confidence company! #Crypto #Blockchain #ICO #Crowdfunding #Cardstack #dApps
1810 2018-01-25 21:19:37 Smart move @RobinhoodApp, a week before the last big crypto crash I emptied my Robinhood account and put it all in crypto. Free trading will have me moving it back.
1811 2018-01-25 21:19:27 Bosch AmA - IOTA #cryptoking
1812 2018-01-25 21:19:27 For example, when china banned crypto, and massive amount of money left the crypto space causing many projects to drop a large amount in value. If they were to re-legalize trading, we would see a MASSIVE influx of money that would substantially increase prices.

1815 2018-01-25 21:18:51 Crypto got him eating good LMAOOOO
1816 2018-01-25 21:18:51 I personally am invested in PAC, so of course I like it. It was abandoned by the developers, but then the community started building it, so I think it could be a good coin. 
And I am also in POE, they don`t scream their messages all over twitter the whole time.
1817 2018-01-25 21:18:43 I'm gonna start tweeting more like this because it's kinda ridiculous how easy it is to get away with this shit. Crypto Community should be built on trust, not fake numbers
1818 2018-01-25 21:18:39 Bitcoin Cash has already hard forked on its own in November. There was no chain split. That's how you do a proper network upgrade.
1819 2018-01-25 21:18:37 por economía digital te refieres a crypto?
1820 2018-01-25 21:18:36 To therefore try to reserve the term 'anarchism' for this 'pure' state of 'absolute' freedom in which everyone is totally atomized to do whatever each likes with no sort of restrictions on any behavior is to go against the whole history of anarchist thinking.
1821 2018-01-25 21:18:14 those involved in crypto today are getting a taste of the future of information warfare. trust and reputation will be more important than ever.
1822 2018-01-25 21:18:14 My sentiments exactly. Don’t let your affinity for crypto cloud your investment decisions... always be objective, and logical. Protect ya neck...
1823 2018-01-25 21:18:12 Now can I buy?
1824 2018-01-25 21:18:12 Does this graphic reflect the ICO (crypto currency) money raised? The statistics I’ve seen suggest there’s a whole new bar.
1825 2018-01-25 21:18:05 Not sure you should call it a "debate" when the back drop says "crypto asset BUBBLE"
1826 2018-01-25 21:18:00 ZClassic (ZCL) is nearly 30 % up  

This might be due to the Bitcoin Private (BTCP) fork, where you get 1 BTCP for every ZCL or BTC you hold. 

Announcement with the exact date might be coming out

1827 2018-01-25 21:17:45 Interpretation: "crypto currency mining is CREATING too much power..and none goes to me!"
1828 2018-01-25 21:17:43 Get ready for bCash Cash, lol
1829 2018-01-25 21:17:38 That's a limiting view of crypto. Bitcoin is used to track asset ownership (bitcoins) but nothing is stopping a more general purpose crypto (like ethereum) to start tracking IOUs instead. In this regard, Bitcoin is the first blockchain application, not the only.
1830 2018-01-25 21:17:24 You don't know shit  if you knew anything you would knew January/Feb are always low months for crypto.
1831 2018-01-25 21:17:21 Feels like @katyperry and @VibeHubVR should partner up and do a vr concert since Katy is into crypto. Seems like a no brainer to me.

1833 2018-01-25 21:17:19 That Joke might have been funny 400 years ago
1834 2018-01-25 21:17:16 Im thinking 1250 sats by 9pm EST. But like I said, its very volatile so Keep an eye on it, this coin is very subject to whale play
1835 2018-01-25 21:17:06 Damn! I misspelled/misspelt the name of the other crypto per the story I shared ...knew this was going to bite me: Ethereum* ... Or it was the character limit★/ but yes we all need to learn a bit more about cryptos and blockchain tech*.
1836 2018-01-25 21:17:05 Tomorrow have a Crypto meeting in CA the CEO of #Ripple @bgarlinghouse will made a conference. That culd affect the price to get a up rally?
1837 2018-01-25 21:17:03 @aantonop I finished vol. 1 of your book, The Internet of Money. The word "AMAZING!" doesn't do it justice. Andres - thank you for changing my outlook on the world!! Can't wait to read vol. 2! #bitcoin #cryptocurrency #crypto #decentralization #consensus

1839 2018-01-25 21:17:01 Best way to learn. Expensive, but the it’s the scars that maketh the trader.
1840 2018-01-25 21:16:58 is there a spot I should ffw for the meat?
1841 2018-01-25 21:16:51 100 JPY(BTC): 1049.718 ~ 1052.404 KRW(BTC)
1842 2018-01-25 21:16:50 There has been a lot of talk about governments banning and destroying bitcoin. This line of thinking ignores the reality of inter-jurisdictional competition. Countries do not work in unison. They compete. If one country bans bitcoin, others will welcome it with open arms #crypto
1843 2018-01-25 21:16:46 So if that is ur only argument, as fees go down (as your graph shows) BCH's utility diminishes, cause lets be real, if the proponents have to misinform and lie to others, its not a very solid project. Sorry bud.
1844 2018-01-25 21:16:44 You did not lose until you sold at a loss!
1845 2018-01-25 21:16:24 Today I quit my job to mine crypto and day trade all daty! LOL
1846 2018-01-25 21:16:20 I don't think any of your "smart" crypto friends run their own node or ever heard of segwit or lightning. The sole use case for bcash is disappearing this year. BTC will take it.
1847 2018-01-25 21:16:17 If you think exchanges are only mapping fiat source identity and not source/destination of crypto then you are greatly mistaken.
1848 2018-01-25 21:16:16 It’s interesting how millennials gravitate to crypto currency but I get ppl like shiny new things.
1849 2018-01-25 21:15:48 Core cannot fork now.. It risks giving BCH majority hash rate. They have to make LN the only way to use BTC.
1850 2018-01-25 21:15:45 $DBG & $LTC. Why you don’t even have $LTC on there is a little odd?
1851 2018-01-25 21:15:44 I promised to reveal which masternode Coin I invested in... $SYNX Great pos Crypto with a yearly ROI over 100% (do your research great project) #masternode #synx #cryptocurreny #bitcoin

1854 2018-01-25 21:15:32 just calm down dude
I'll stop commenting, hope this make you happy and hope it change market opinion
1855 2018-01-25 21:15:16 Need to update the app to see crypto
1856 2018-01-25 21:15:13 /Agree but much better ways then crypto currencies...but if you do only 1-3% of your portfolio would be prudent...btw...I so miss VA...I lived there for almost 10 years...such a beautiful place to live...do you miss the Hawaiian life? Be well...
1857 2018-01-25 21:15:11 My point is that to do so is a bit of a red herring, because words get their meaning from actual usage, and those firmly within the anarchist tradition have all imagined societies with various forms of cooperation or agreement or 'laws' based on NAP or natural law or whatever.
1858 2018-01-25 21:14:56 Money is given power when the people using it believe in it. Less and less do I believe in the power of the dollar. Crypto is valuable because we say it is. Do it.

1871 2018-01-25 21:14:03 Can't tell if that post is Sarcasm ...
1872 2018-01-25 21:13:57 Agreed. It ticks every box. And no hype. No pump. Just a solid team and solid organic growth. If you’re looking for a real crypto project that’ll change lives, it’s got to be $RUP. It’s so cheap.
1873 2018-01-25 21:13:56 Don't tell anyone---they'll probably be demonetized.
1874 2018-01-25 21:13:55 I'm tired of listening to your ass talk. bTrash *CANNOT* have LN. They decided to go with bugged code that makes it impossible.
1875 2018-01-25 21:13:47 Hello! We sent you a DM!
1876 2018-01-25 21:13:47 Isn't anyone concerned about Tether ? They seem to be printing more than the FED currently and seem to have a curious relationship with BitFinex. Shady website.. Could cause a major crash perhaps some say, like CryptoInvestor on youtube. A penny crypto for your thoughts? 


1877 2018-01-25 21:13:46 @clif_high How come you never talk about the impact of Tether on crypto value? It's basically fiat in crypto form that's getting printed out of thin air to prop up the prices.
1878 2018-01-25 21:13:41 Crypto u like $PLR?
1879 2018-01-25 21:13:34 Keep turning people on to that crypto, big dogg.  Just make sure you believe in a project and it's devs, before you mention it please.  

BTW, I have no info, as of yet, on Robinhood, good or bad.  So this post has nothing to do with their project, and I wish it success.
1880 2018-01-25 21:13:33 Always be careful when dealing with crypto, but I've done well on it so if you find someone who knows what they're doing, it can be worth the gamble (but it is gambling, so be careful).

1887 2018-01-25 21:13:12 There's a significant difference between VALUE and CURRENCY. Wherever you may be on your #crypto journey - this is a good concept with which to start understanding. Avoid becoming a shill, and turn your excitement into expertise
1888 2018-01-25 21:13:10 For crypto, look for non-iCO tokens with large architectural differences to the top 20 market cap coins.

1906 2018-01-25 21:12:04 I thought "Core" was not allowing blocks to grow because of lightning, yet now you claim lightning needs bigger blocks to work, yet core will never let that happen. More cognitive dissonance.

Revizor is an innovative project in the field of regulation of the crypto currency market, 
the main task of which is to create software tools that would filter a wide range of assets by absoring unpromising tokens.
1912 2018-01-25 21:11:36 Why do you think people buying any ICO now a days .  So they can sell 10x in exchanges next day.  Not sure we are going with actual crypto currency technology.

1914 2018-01-25 21:11:30 robinhood announcing they'll start trading crypto is huge - no fees, will add coins and put a lot of pressure on coinbase for sure

1929 2018-01-25 21:10:37 Gold is not a stock though. Yet bitcoin behaves more like gold. I think there are maybe 3 asset classes, there are crypto stocks, crypto stores (bitcoin), crypto currencies
1930 2018-01-25 21:10:35 My point is more a linguistic one. You seem to want to reserve the term 'anarchism' for this 'absolute state of freedom' which to you - by this definition - can seem to include no laws or cooperation. Otherwise 'it's not anarchism but agorism or mutualism' as you say.
1931 2018-01-25 21:10:34 @iconominet serious team with very serious ambitious to be the gateway of the 'old world' economy to the #crypto economy. Working hard to het legal and correct fast and solid growth. #ICONOMI $ICN
1932 2018-01-25 21:10:34 If any of those new FB friends are high school girls (or parents of) can you let them know about this cool CTF just for girls? @GirlsGoCyberStart has tons of crypto!

1934 2018-01-25 21:10:33 Core is the only development team for BTC. Miners have the final say on whatever code is developed. Core has stopped working on BTC code in favor of only the LN.
1935 2018-01-25 21:10:32 Never
1936 2018-01-25 21:10:26 I also bought some shit!
1937 2018-01-25 21:10:22 Is bitcoin the only crypto you know exist? Cmon man! There’s so many other coins way better than bitcoin $xvg $tron $xlm $eth
1938 2018-01-25 21:10:21 Price of $BTC is higher on binance than gdax rn @crypto_bobby
1939 2018-01-25 21:10:00 The only thing I dislike about the crypto market are new investors that don't care to take the time to learn about mistakes already made in the past in equity markets. Yes the asset is different but many principles still hold true.
1940 2018-01-25 21:10:00 @rogerkver as per our understanding when we connected the dots.. each & every crypto is ultimately paired with Bitcoin in a centralised manner because it it's 1st crypto asset & BITCOIN's founder is anonymous.. what's your view on this?
1941 2018-01-25 21:09:52 Ure the man

1943 2018-01-25 21:09:36 Yeah... definitely more worried about an army of angry armed crustaceans than a finger happy man having a nuke button near by!
1944 2018-01-25 21:09:33 We all can agree that any positive publicity for crypto is good 
1945 2018-01-25 21:09:30 I c u have some crypto in your profile but r advocating STOCK OWNERSHIP??? Stocks have about as much intrinsic value as coins do which is basically NOTHING but paper certificates. If u want ownership buy physical gold/silver or property/land...CRYPTOS might be 2 risky 4u
1946 2018-01-25 21:09:26 $IOST is also on a good run at the moment
1947 2018-01-25 21:09:26 Needed that extra crypto courage
1948 2018-01-25 21:09:18 Can I buy now?

1952 2018-01-25 21:08:59 My point here is not that big blocks on BTC will be bad, it's that Core will never allow BTC to have bigger blocks, when it desperately needs them.

A few years ago we were all excited that the world may some day use the blockchain. Now it's only those who can afford it.
1953 2018-01-25 21:08:54 If Bitcoin can break resistance at the 12600 level and later at 14500, it's next stop would be to test 17000 level. Bitcoin is headed towards last year's 20k high or will surely test those limits. #BTC #Eth #crypto

1979 2018-01-25 21:06:44 The 21 weekly moving average suggests that bitcoin has completed a three way correction and found support at the 10,500 level, which could act as a springboard for upward price movement.

1985 2018-01-25 21:06:11 The internet wasn’t designed with security in mind. The gaffe that keeps on giving ... to organized crime & rogue states. Took many many centuries to secure & inside banking. Crypto is the future - but not the tech that’s hardly at v 1.0 today.

2059 2018-01-25 21:00:52 They were recommended on Nerd Wallet as a good stock trading site for new investors. Do you see this as a sign crypto being adopted by the mainstream, or will this get tokens classified as securities?

2071 2018-01-25 20:59:49 No for a few reasons.  1. LN usage is entirely optional.  *no one* ever has to use it.  2. The centralized LN node operators are already centralized in all the scary ways.  I'm *already* worried about how much crypto these companies hold on behalf of individuals.
2072 2018-01-25 20:59:47 It would be very useful but that depends on the exchanges which they use: @CoinomiWallet uses ShapeShift and Changelly; @ShapeShift_io and @Changelly_team
2073 2018-01-25 20:59:33 Millete sataş, sonra küfretti diye iftira at, ne güzel iş..:) Kendisi crypto piyasasında olup sırf AKP'ye laf ettirmemek için BTC balondur görüşünü destekleyen ben değilim. Öncelikle bulunduğunuz ikilemden çıkın.
2074 2018-01-25 20:59:28 He is liing thru the skin on his lips!  The US, is a 'corproration" and is holding $$$ n the US treasury in  all of our STRAWMAN names& not giving us access, and forcing us to be DEBT SLAVES!! They just want to control crypto because it's worth more that the riches they have!BOO!
2075 2018-01-25 20:59:28 How did you come to this conclusion?? I done some research and I can not see any compelling evidence. Remember hype is not evidence, the crypto market is too immature. CPC has a few partners which are house hold names in crypto but these companies themselves are new startups $ITC

2082 2018-01-25 20:58:50 Hey congrats man
2083 2018-01-25 20:58:49 If you follow my tweets you’d know I like other crypto assets. Do I like large premines? No. Do I like centralization? No. Do I like the founders owning 75% of the supply. No
2084 2018-01-25 20:58:44 I can see Bitcoin Private debuting as a top-ten crypto by market cap.
2085 2018-01-25 20:58:27 That is an amazing metaphor.

2089 2018-01-25 20:58:05 Completely agree... if BTC could just be on a nice stable sideways movement we're running with the bulls
2090 2018-01-25 20:57:58 But... are you certifiable?
2091 2018-01-25 20:57:56 Hello what coin do you think is the best one buy right now
2092 2018-01-25 20:57:55 There are many many words in the English language that are used for multiple different things. Crypto is to cryptography and cryptocurrency as Bob is to Bobbert and Robert. Arguing the semantics is futile.

2099 2018-01-25 20:57:37 He better add soon. Robin hood trading app just started trading crypto. If they add more coins that Coinbase then people will leave coinbase. Robin hood claims no fees and faster processing time! Bye bye coinbase!
2100 2018-01-25 20:57:37 Robinhood pushing this new crypto trading feature hard. Kinda suspect.
2101 2018-01-25 20:57:37 The crypto community has reached startup entrepreneur levels of insufferable in such rapid time.
2102 2018-01-25 20:57:26 Because the rest of the crypto market remained stable right....
2103 2018-01-25 20:57:25 Tether is like 0.2% of the crypto economy. I doubt it will have any meaningful impact except symbolically.

2119 2018-01-25 20:56:25 Exactly, cmc had been refusing to adjust the supply for months now. Vechain has been very transparent about that.
2120 2018-01-25 20:56:21 I hope they have the tech ironed out for the livestream, feel like there are always tech issues with these things in crypto
2121 2018-01-25 20:56:20 @Jelurida @Poloniex Any news on the Ardor status on Poloniex. I know for you guys this is just day to day business, but people have money in those wallets which they believe is/was safe. Weeks and weeks of silence are not professional...
2122 2018-01-25 20:56:17 you don't pay taxes on "personal gifts"....I don't know any country that does.

as its considered post tax already, interested to see how this works for international payments as the US Gov would have no idea of my tax obligations.
2123 2018-01-25 20:56:02 The real question here is... What gif search term did you use to find that gem?
2124 2018-01-25 20:55:51 Haven’t traded Crypto much, waiting for futures to end tomorrow...
2125 2018-01-25 20:55:42 Smart move! I'm going to be having another load up here soon as well. You can never have enough  $DRGN!
2126 2018-01-25 20:55:37 I don't see any tension here. People use cryptocurrencies to finance projects all the time. ICOs are just one example of this. The problem is it's hard to generate crypto-denominated positive ROI at this stage, so most choose to hodl. But I don't think it'll be that way forever.

2130 2018-01-25 20:55:10 I prefer cash because it is anonymous. Simple possession = participation. Cash is totally ubiquitios and socially inclusive. All the things crypto aspires to be. But it isn’t and can’t for the above reasons.
2131 2018-01-25 20:55:08 Cool!
2132 2018-01-25 20:55:07 Trust me Soros is NOT long Bitcoin.  

It would be funny if he came out a few months from now and said he'd lost his whole fortune in crypto. At least he'd stop meddling in other countries with his socialist crackpot movements.
2133 2018-01-25 20:55:04 Ok I will look into that. Thanks for your help

2149 2018-01-25 20:53:48 @Robinhood is great for stocks and we'll see about crypto. I like companies you believe in or use @Square / @TMobile / @Google / @Starbucks / @salesforce   / @Tesla to name a few. I now use @GeminiDotCom better fees than Coinbase for ETH/BTC, but I also mine XMR.

2157 2018-01-25 20:52:54 @crypto_bobby you should take a serious look at Theta Token before it is to late. Great team and so om plus one of the advisors is the youtube founder.

2165 2018-01-25 20:52:13 A crypto that worked as a calculation of labor would not need to be mined like Bitcoin, bitcoin is set up as a digital version of gold anyways.

米のムニューチン財務長官がドル安容認発言をしたら、ドルが値下がりし、仮想通貨市場にマネーが流れたらしく、相場はやや上昇。

その後、トランプ大統領が「強いドルを望む」と発言したら、ドル高傾向。

2212 2018-01-25 20:47:37 For those that are new to crypto or don't understand the importance of #2FA (2 Factor Authentication), it is vital you turn it on for any exchange that you use.  You can download the Google Authenticator app for your phone to set it up.  This drastically improves security.
2213 2018-01-25 20:47:36 Removed the last $XRB off #bitgrail a few days ago right before verification lockdown. I feel relieved and sad for those who did not heed warning and take action as soon as withdrawals reopened. But... this is crypto gotta fight to swim or you’re gonna sink.

2232 2018-01-25 20:46:06 I need tips on how to buy crypto currencies in general , anyone willing to help
2233 2018-01-25 20:46:05 @Sambrooks90
2234 2018-01-25 20:45:55 I wonder when we’ll start buying bits with crypto currency? 
2235 2018-01-25 20:45:54 Definitely under the radar.  Fulfilling a real world need using crypto.  Providing a much needed liquidity issue for sme'sin it's target market. Consider yourself lucky to be getting at the beginning.
2236 2018-01-25 20:45:54 Method IS strong, but not that strong! There's crypto theology, and then there's crypto theology.
2237 2018-01-25 20:45:53 Amen 
2238 2018-01-25 20:45:48 When are you all adding tron to your crypto selections? @RobinhoodApp $trx
2239 2018-01-25 20:45:41 I doubt he does. But total inflows into crypto is whatever mined coins were sold for, not (latest price X no. of coins)
On that metric, the % attributed to Tether is *significantly* higher. Try 30%, and then we can argue about it!
2240 2018-01-25 20:45:39 wallet works and is secure albeit not user friendly for crypto newbies. your point is @arnold_tomis
2241 2018-01-25 20:45:25 Is it true that CT. Not going to be able to trade crypto?
2242 2018-01-25 20:45:22 Gonna stop doing my own homework and base all my FA for crypto on @katyperry fingernails. What could go wrong?

2264 2018-01-25 20:43:39 Jesus and most of what he did was recorded by several trustworthy historians at the time, including Tacitus, whose records we still use to write our history books.
2265 2018-01-25 20:43:37 Basing all my FA for crypto on @katyperry fingernails
2266 2018-01-25 20:43:27 Yeah... "Method" in NA is often treated explicitly like an ideological security blanket. We talk ad nauseum about crypto theologians, but rarely about folks literally choosing ss methods so as not to interrogate themselves (i.e. Be a Scholar and a Christian).
2267 2018-01-25 20:43:27 For a person to say that wealth is finite in 2018 in the midst of the crypto and stock boom is just insane.

2269 2018-01-25 20:43:20 Read the below on twitter

#TRON could likely be added to @BittrexExchange next as 1 of the prerequisites to being on #BITTREX is to have your coin open source.  #TRX just became open source this month. $TRX on BITTREX will be a game changer as this exchange is MASSIVE #crypto

2272 2018-01-25 20:43:06 Robinhood means every other company will follow. Scared to be left behind means crypto acceptance.

2281 2018-01-25 20:42:00 Robinhood really made zero commission crypto trading possible on the same mobile platform that I trade stocks on. FYI, that’s a big deal.

2284 2018-01-25 20:41:51 So... Started jokingly mining crypto currency... Interesting. Slightly addictive. Too bad it'll take years for me to get pennies. Lol.
2285 2018-01-25 20:41:37 Guy makes $250k in 48 hours by making a website called PonziCoin, that explained, in detail, how it was a ponzi scheme. People still bought, and are now upset he's run off with the cash. #crypto

2287 2018-01-25 20:41:29 Kucoin imho is one of the worst - don’t know why but it is complicated. Many my friends says the same.
2288 2018-01-25 20:41:29 What you just described is systemic of a bull trap and complacency. 

Think that over for a few minutes. Hopefully it provides you some sobriety.
2289 2018-01-25 20:41:27 I feel sorry for you guys. At least it was in crypto.  I had the luck to lose all the money my company made from 2002 all the way till 2013 when Laiki bank went bankrupt

2356 2018-01-25 20:34:13 Well fortunately I'm not new to the crypto world so I know how to do my research otherwise I wouldn't be in the position I am at now. You have to look at the product and tbh with you it looks you're just assuming stuff without any evidence
2357 2018-01-25 20:34:07 Thank you very much , I have already completed the first two videos .. It was so informative and useful . Do you mean by crypto course is your course on your website? I’m willing to invest in learning , I just need some guidance .
2358 2018-01-25 20:34:04 And how big would bCash blocks need to be to support that?

24 GB... EXCEPT, in a 24GB bCash, you could only do 2 tx a day. In LN, you could do 1,000,000 a day with 133MB blocks.

Obv, 24GB is impossible and bCash cannot EVER scale. Good game.
2359 2018-01-25 20:33:54 Well I guess it’s fine as long as Bitcoin keeps going up and people don’t want to pull real USD out of crypto. This might explain the sudden alt revival when $btc went mad and the sudden $btc recovery a couple of days ago.
2360 2018-01-25 20:33:52 I sure hope so!!!!

2366 2018-01-25 20:33:33 Russia's draft #law: mining is business activity, crypto-exchanges should be registered in #Russia, and unqualified investors can buy tokens for no more than fifty thousand rubles ($1000).
2367 2018-01-25 20:33:30 What did Cardano to you that you are twittering now a lot about it. Please give some more reliable information than just accuse this coin! Your argument is based on nothing now!
2368 2018-01-25 20:33:25 wait, are we on containers now? is that what we're shaming people in to?
2369 2018-01-25 20:33:10 @JewKorean read, read and then read some more on $DOT.    Spec play - big time- either a zero or a complete Moon.
2370 2018-01-25 20:33:10 I‘m sorry if you’ve had to pay learning money. I didn’t. I’ve gained more that I could imagine but at this point I do not know if I’m any good at trading, since the market just knew 1 direction . Under these circumstances - why don’t teach noobs 4 free until u know ur good?
2371 2018-01-25 20:33:10 I just need to spend less time on crypto and more time studying lol
2372 2018-01-25 20:33:06 I saw a few comments of winners who stated that they have received winnings of Sub tokens, Ether etc, but not physical items such as laptops and phones. 
I also have not received those Sub t-shirts that were offered shortly after ICO.
2373 2018-01-25 20:33:03 Weiss ranking? Wtf @Crypto_goat_
2374 2018-01-25 20:33:00 I know we all don't like a list of crypto hashes ....but I will what I hold. Follow for Follow. Not here to promote just want good advise and knowledgeable people to be surrounded by. $POE $TRX $IOST $ETH $LEND $XRP $ADA $BTC $LTC. New people to crypto let's touch base!

2380 2018-01-25 20:32:37 Oh.  I had no COB as at Jan 5th but I've purchased about 1000 now.  Hopefully,  should get some airdrops when next $COB underwrites  an ICO
2381 2018-01-25 20:32:36 Essentially get in now on any #crypto. In 2-5 years it will be mainstream and the biggest opertunity will be out of reach for a normal person. Think if you could invest in #Microsoft when it was a start-up.
2382 2018-01-25 20:32:35 You playing crypto now too haha
2383 2018-01-25 20:32:12 Don't think so. But the fact they have Crypto coming to their platform is awesome. Just announced it today.
2384 2018-01-25 20:32:08 Stop lying. This is 100% a complete and utter LIE:

"They voted over 95% for 2x and Core devs refused to support it."

You're full of shit and you know it.

2386 2018-01-25 20:31:42 Soros calls crypto currencies like #Bitcoin a typical bubble. But it will not pop as usual as dictators like to hide their money in cryptos. #wef18

2389 2018-01-25 20:31:38 Hey @naval if you were to label crypto technology, what would be the most appropriate description - blockchain technology, distributed ledger technology, distributed/decentralized technology, cryptographic technology and or any combination/new description you can think of?
2390 2018-01-25 20:31:33 @MichaelSuppo with the news of Robinhood (and likely others to follow in the near future) picking up crypto, do you think it'll hurt the potential of Ethos ($BQX)
2391 2018-01-25 20:31:32 @Stash you next to join the fun? Don’t let coinbase and Robinhood make all the money in this crypto rush. There is room for more people to come to crypto party!

2394 2018-01-25 20:31:24 A great way to stop yourself from over trading is to play #chess against a computer. Since if you're into #crypto you probably don't have any friends to play with.
2395 2018-01-25 20:31:23 the need of freedom is strongest than every kind of regulations $crypto
2396 2018-01-25 20:31:19 What She's sayin' : If you start a statement with "It's only NORMAL to .." : You've already LOST in #crypto : Go back to where "normal" lives : You made a wrong turn somewhere when people GAF about what you think 'normal" is/should be : Won't find it here 
2397 2018-01-25 20:31:19 @AskRobinhood Is there a secret for adding crypto to my watchlist? Searching for BTC results in nothing.
2398 2018-01-25 20:31:16 Arsenal signed a crypto currency deal?
2399 2018-01-25 20:31:15 This isnt investment advice... but #NEO / $NEO has a devcon which means it will probably surge if the market stays the same.

2400 2018-01-25 20:31:10 The crypto hater are more proof that people don't like seeing others succeed.

Good lesson in life really

2410 2018-01-25 20:30:18 I wonder if winners of the other days got their prizes already.
2411 2018-01-25 20:29:58 @RobinhoodApp is a well established app that will be offering crypto trading in USA. best news is they will have no/low trading fees!! @RobinhoodApp
2412 2018-01-25 20:29:50 Great question. It’d be great to receive clarification as soon as possible!

2418 2018-01-25 20:29:32 Welcome to the crypto market, if you can't handle 30-40% dips, then you can't handle 500% gains. Quit being a dip virgin.

2420 2018-01-25 20:29:24 Robinhood perhaps??? They have announced that they will be adding crypto's for trading.

2423 2018-01-25 20:29:02 I don't like that everything is coming out at once almost like it's trying to defend BTC from falling past 10k.  Let it dip, bounce and make a healthy rise.
2424 2018-01-25 20:28:45 No word.  I contacted admin in slack to remind Sub of this.  Waiting for reply.
2425 2018-01-25 20:28:41 Borderline??? The Merkle is short selling your Supreme Gentleman-ness
2426 2018-01-25 20:28:39 Dat zal de tijd zeker. Maar 1 ding is zeker, de bitcoin is niet achterhaald :)
2427 2018-01-25 20:28:36 Because no one wants to buy it on HitBtc
2428 2018-01-25 20:28:35 Read yr answers, but some ratings make no sense. XRP. If being a company is considered a "risk", then the whole stock market is risky. Isn't yr rating meant to help us investors avoid risk? Then don't rate from purist-crypto standards (decentr. etc), but judge: risk to investor!
2429 2018-01-25 20:28:33 You're citing BS out of context dude. Stop. By this standard, BCH is a complete and utter failure, as it needs 24+ GB blocks to work.
2430 2018-01-25 20:28:32 Interesting about #gold; in 2001 it was too expensive to have a gold mine so mines closed. Then computers became popular and gold was needed for connections so demand went up but it was too expensive to reopen the mines so the supply was low and price skyrocketed. #crypto?
2431 2018-01-25 20:28:32 @vergecurrency i’ve updated the wallet to 4.0.1. Two and a half days ago. It it still syncing and my xvg’s are still unconfirmed. Is this going to be a problem? Do I need to do something else or? Please respond so i’ll know what to do. Thanks!
2432 2018-01-25 20:28:30 Do you want a gain in the short term or a bigger one in the long term??? Platform is needed and then awareness and marketing will come! Real demand will come from people who want to use the platform in order to fund invoices! $HVN $ETH #blockchain @hiveproject_net

2444 2018-01-25 20:27:30 Looks like they're all over 1MB... I thought Segwit did not increase block size... which is it then?
2445 2018-01-25 20:27:29 The main issue I see with their value model is the weighting.  It also lacks proper categorization.  

Analyzing bitcoin, XRP, ethereum, and EOS using the same metrics is like deciding whether to invest your 401k into mutual funds or IPO’s... there are subclasses in crypto.
2446 2018-01-25 20:27:28 Honeybadger is cold.
2447 2018-01-25 20:27:27 I’ve spent upwards of five minutes just staring at “CRYPTO GENIUS”’s serene smile tbh
2448 2018-01-25 20:27:11 Tax code for crypto is so unclear..
2449 2018-01-25 20:27:10 It’s not like Coinbase was a big hurdle for someone trying to get in to crypto.

#Otho_Network #Cryptocurrency #OTH
2451 2018-01-25 20:27:04 A "no-commission stock trading app". Go Robinhood with its integration of crypto starting in Feb. *slow claps*. I'm tired of these coinbase fees 
2452 2018-01-25 20:26:55 I predict most ICO Tokens and ICOs to go under in the next few months with a resurgence in bitcoin and "actual" crypto.
2453 2018-01-25 20:26:46 It's the beginning of mainstream media crypto influencer's, we're doomed
2454 2018-01-25 20:26:46 Cryptocurrencies that are pegged to #Gold and #Silver are coming soon. Also, blockchain technology for accounting silver and gold bars will make manipulating metals market harder and harder . The crypto hype is coming to precious metals soon .
2455 2018-01-25 20:26:43 I'm a crypto enthusiast & investor but not a Bitcoin believer. Curious what people think re: Ethereum vs Cardano...
2456 2018-01-25 20:26:42 Been wanting to trade crypto but the rakes are nuts. I've been using RH for a while so I'm excited. Too bad there's a line
2457 2018-01-25 20:26:40 I will try to make that happen. Thank you @CryptoDevourer

2460 2018-01-25 20:26:22 @netflix @reedhastings Hello Reed, several of my fellow YouTube Crypto/Bitcoin influencers are interested in talking with you about doing a series/channel. Thought I'd give you the opportunity to get ahead of the coming mass public interest, with a existing viewer base. 
2461 2018-01-25 20:26:14 1. Says you.
2. You're talking about 7 billion people * 2 channels a year. That's theoretical. BCH would need around 50 GB blocks to compete... so... yeah, it will NEVER EVER be able to scale anywhere near that. Be real, dude.
3. "Contentious"
2462 2018-01-25 20:26:05 Support at crypto hub told me someone is already listing 421 coin, we'll have an open exchange for it soon.

2470 2018-01-25 20:25:37 I don't see how crypto-fiat is different from normal fiat. The underlying governing system and emittance is the problem and this most probably will not change.

2474 2018-01-25 20:25:11 Newbie asking, not that I’m looking at selling ATM, but what is the best way to sell bitcoin for GBP here in the UK. Coinbase or Coincut? Thanks in advance peeps! #crypto #coinbase #cryptocurreny #tron #trx #bitcon #pound
2475 2018-01-25 20:25:10 By now most #FUD i read from #crypto #holders or #traders about other #coins they don't #hold clearly are more expressing fear from loss that properly a qualified or technical opinion regard that other coin. In other words, they shows the force of what they are blaming.
2476 2018-01-25 20:24:59 Crypto mining really has taken its toll on GPU market prices. Are SSD's next as #blockchain databases increase in size?

2487 2018-01-25 20:24:23 The team is product focused now...

Don’t worry and buy until it’s cheap! $HVN
2488 2018-01-25 20:24:09 Everyone knows Bank Of Ammerica is garbage anyways. They can keep their high fees, and keep falling behind as they have been. They are not needed in crypto.
2489 2018-01-25 20:24:08 There was an article today in Financial Times about banks looking toward crypto more and more as regulations come in. So this article might aswell be thrown away!!! 
2490 2018-01-25 20:24:00 I thought someone else’s but me knew about crypto currency in school for a sec :/ then I asked and just got disappointed 
2491 2018-01-25 20:23:58 @AskRobinhood with crypto will you be able to move it off of the @RobinhoodApp ?
2492 2018-01-25 20:23:45 Won't be long before we see the @katyperry Beach Confidential newsletter.. For the low, low price of $2,997

2494 2018-01-25 20:23:39 People downloading stuffs from torrent are telling me Crypto Currency is illegal . lol New version of hypocrisy #cryptocurrency #Ripple @Ripple
2495 2018-01-25 20:23:25 @KremlinRussia добрый вечер, подскажите пожалуйста, когда уже некомпетентные криворукие рукожопы (50% думы) перестанут принимать законопроекты в областях, где они ноль без палки??? спасибо!
2496 2018-01-25 20:23:24 #Crypto is interesting because it is a collection of: nerds, libertarians, liberals, conservatives, neo-cons, privacy-seekers, business types, oppurtunists, realists, idealists, noobs, experts, emotional traders, bots, capitalists, socialists, billionaires and normies. #Bitcoin
2497 2018-01-25 20:23:16 Tfw you bought the top of TRX and have to shill it to your grandkids
2498 2018-01-25 20:23:15 Buy crypto now cuz next month when ppl get they refund I'm positive the price will sky rocket
2499 2018-01-25 20:23:11 Spend a few months in a room where none of the walls meet at right angles and then get back to me, if you can speak anything but crazed gibberish by then.
2500 2018-01-25 20:23:08 Will you be able to move crypto off of the Robinhood app?
2501 2018-01-25 20:23:06 ??
2502 2018-01-25 20:23:02 My advice to new $Crypto warriors:

For day trading:
- Use only 25% of your stack max

For investing:
- Use 75% of your stack
- #DYOR 
- Pick solid projects u believe in
- Find a good entry
- Fucking #HODL !!! 
2503 2018-01-25 20:22:55 Algo's are going wild from this . There is an inevitable run to precious metals and crypto coming . I recommend people start reading about #cryptocurrency #bitcoin and also #Gold and #Silver . Only safe haven assets will save you from coming panic selling and depression
2504 2018-01-25 20:22:42 You still havent disproven it
2505 2018-01-25 20:22:40 That's your opinion. Because enough people don't share it, it won't be true in the near future.

Not to say it won't be supplanted and fade to irrelevance one day. But that day isn't soon, not by crypto-time.

2508 2018-01-25 20:22:32 Thanks @NewMediaMB and @rrc for the great lunch hour session on blockchain and crypto currencies! Excellent event, looking forward to the next one!
2509 2018-01-25 20:22:29 Soon brodda soon
2510 2018-01-25 20:22:28 @RobinhoodApp How we cant sign up for non-usa country ? 
I could not select turkey :(
2511 2018-01-25 20:22:22 Long or short term?
2512 2018-01-25 20:22:18 If you're new to crypto and the community you follow pumps $XRP, $TRX, or $IOTA please DM me their other recommendations so I know what not to buy.
2513 2018-01-25 20:22:05 That's what they say. And a terrible Target for a cryptoproject. But people will buy it.
2514 2018-01-25 20:22:02 Couldn't agree more with you man
Not following any of that 20-50k followers crypto OG's
Stay cool 
2515 2018-01-25 20:21:54 $FTFT could be done dropping. A little bit of confidence and others will buy. We'll see. #pennystocks #blockchain #crypto
2516 2018-01-25 20:21:36 It also seems like a failed attempt at selling gold.
2517 2018-01-25 20:21:36 Ill be giving away 1.5 trx when I hit 10 followers!!!

2523 2018-01-25 20:21:24 You are a very respected figure in the crypto community and people will look to you for answers. I think you should spread the word about @rogerkver purposely confusing people into buying his #bcash shitcoin.
2524 2018-01-25 20:21:22 SO DO I.

SALT (Secure automated lending technology) is offering a collateral based loans using crypto assets. I think as a platform it is going to be very successful.
2525 2018-01-25 20:21:14 Ouch!!!!!
2526 2018-01-25 20:21:12 One of the worst FUD articles I've ever seen. It's particularly shady because they switch from speaking about Bitcoin to speaking about Bitconnect from sentence to sentence assuming the reader won't know the difference about what they are reading.
2527 2018-01-25 20:21:05 Stoked to learn that @RobinhoodApp is wading into cryptocurrency waters. I tried the app out earlier this year and loved the UX, but stopped using because I'm not interested in the stock market. They've definitely brought me back with being able to purchase crypto w/ no fees.
2528 2018-01-25 20:21:01 In b4 Chicago is the $crypto IB capital of the western world.
2529 2018-01-25 20:20:58 It's an addition to a tweet i gave last week telling people to not build a PC right now because the crypto hype has doubled the cost of GPUS....that "THANKS" is drenched in sarcasm.
2530 2018-01-25 20:20:53 You have to get about 150 odd ppl tagged in. Then you create 3 branches. Then you add 50 or so to those and so forth.
2531 2018-01-25 20:20:48 Such a scam!! Crypto currencies all the way!
2532 2018-01-25 20:20:43 @COBINHOOD does it mean that now you are just the copy paste  of Robinhood with similar name? $COB
2533 2018-01-25 20:20:38 Bilemiyorum. Websitesi çalışıyor ona sukrediyorum. Asıl sorun rune denen CEO nun boklu geçmişi ve karaktersizligi. Coss hala çok ucuz. Fiat Gateway koyarlarsa sağlam uçar. Developer falan da alirlarsa...
2534 2018-01-25 20:20:35 Hoping for a miracle here , @James_Hakim ;)
Would double my investment in #crypto
2535 2018-01-25 20:20:27 True because I think the many youutubers were conspiring together because at one point a lot of them like Craig grant began claiming they got hacked and lost some btc or something and began to channel money out of Bitconnect.Not exactly sure but youtubersnot telling viewers isbad
2536 2018-01-25 20:20:21 Not interested in betting but just like talking sports and shootin' the shit? I have a slack group where it's absolutely *FREE* to join. We have a general chat, a crypto currency channel and place to share books/platforms to use!

2537 2018-01-25 20:20:14 That's not at all expensive, compared to BTC.
2538 2018-01-25 20:20:11 Blockchain is Darwinism in terms of digital finance.Keeps it decentralized & transparent.The future isn't thru the USD,it'll be thru crypto.MSM will demonize crypto until Big Government has it's controlling hand on it.

Instead I downgraded and will use the difference in price to buy more crypto.

2553 2018-01-25 20:19:01 So don’t buy once it hit huobi?
2554 2018-01-25 20:18:50 @StephenBaldwin7 Your a genius just saw your interview on the news about crypto and Dash in general!
2555 2018-01-25 20:18:49 J’ai pas mal d’idées en ce moment. Il y a beaucoup d’argent à se faire sur des activités illégales. Je pense donc à uberiser le braconnage en me basant sur la #blockchain et une crypto maison.
2556 2018-01-25 20:18:32 Everyone with #crypto in their twitter handle:

“#XYZ has been dropping for 3 days, time to rebound, it’s going to the moon  “

“#ABC has been steady for a week, it’s about to break out to the moon  “

“#HIJ went up 100% today. It’s gonna keep going to the moon “

  
2557 2018-01-25 20:18:11 Hedge funds have been over 75% long gold oil copper and short dollar.  The unraveling started an hour ago.
2558 2018-01-25 20:18:10 Crypto-trading is the way to go. No more giving my BTC to any so called btc mining company for some ponzi profits
2559 2018-01-25 20:18:09 will Korea make a difference to the crypto market on Jan 31 when they are back  in the game? @CryptoCoinNewz
2560 2018-01-25 20:18:06 It would be interesting if you put skin in the game and invest in crypto if you haven't already. It is easy to watch from a distance and point. Get on board the coaster
2561 2018-01-25 20:18:04 I glanced over it, it didn’t excite me too much at the time but maybe I’ll have a better look
2562 2018-01-25 20:18:02 I'm going to create a Chicago XFL franchise with my crypto money. What should the team name be?
2563 2018-01-25 20:18:02 @DiaryofaMadeMan 
Have you taken a look at Jet8 App already ?
2564 2018-01-25 20:18:00 Which ICO is this?
2565 2018-01-25 20:18:00 I think that depends on size?  Are you size in length, or size in sph (shitposts per hour)?
2566 2018-01-25 20:18:00 Could possibly interpreted as “slowly kill yourself”?
2567 2018-01-25 20:17:56 It's official guys, our crypto party is nearly over
2568 2018-01-25 20:17:51 Not really true. People have been murdered, beaten and terrorized. Also, crypto-Nazis in police doing active harm. It just doesn’t “count”.
2569 2018-01-25 20:17:42 Could be as a loss-leader with expectation that the wallet segment of the crypto value chain will accrue substantial economic leverage over time (and this is the right play to position for that space.)
2570 2018-01-25 20:17:40 You'd think that he would give even a small percentage of his referral money back to the people somehow or something would be nice gesture?
2571 2018-01-25 20:17:13 I need this plastered on my wall lol
2572 2018-01-25 20:16:58 ah yes. sea of 3DS crypto tools, check

2577 2018-01-25 20:16:35 So I finally accept Crypto Currencies.
2578 2018-01-25 20:16:34 Yeah no choice. I made more money in FANS stocks rather than crypto lol
2579 2018-01-25 20:16:31 If we couldn't trust our politicians to not debase our currency over millenia, despite knowing exactly where they live and work; how the hell could anyone trust the honest backing of a so-called "stablecoin"? The entire concept of a stablecoin is what will destroy crypto.
2580 2018-01-25 20:16:29 Its doing just fine? Stable Mcap for the last week?
2581 2018-01-25 20:16:27 2) But WHAT a chance forgone to give the public a structured, educated perspective on #blockchain and #crypto. Shiller is always a great guest, just not on this panel (e.g., "I really do not understand the whole picture here, [what are private keys?])

2591 2018-01-25 20:15:35 Know your customer (kyc) regulations will be set and Koreans with specific bank accounts can flush liquidity into the crypto market. Guess what’ll be their new favorite coin. BitHumb has already recommended users to register in advance. Coinone is owned by the same holding.
2592 2018-01-25 20:15:25 That’s the US Reg D investors who have invested...does not include foreign investors and most hedge funds’ offshore vehicles.  Like many things crypto, the majority of the action is offshore.

2594 2018-01-25 20:15:15 This is a completely stupid analysis IMO. It can cost millions to get an ICO off the ground. You’re asking businessmen like me to become a full time member of a team. U better be paying damn good for risky adventures in Crypto.

2606 2018-01-25 20:14:38 For the crypto market as a whole to move forward the negative correlation of $BTC to alts ahas to be overcome. We are seeing a few alts right now break that trend.

2609 2018-01-25 20:14:37 I mean do I have to have the proper miners to mine specific algorithms for these masternodes?

2625 2018-01-25 20:13:29 With the rest of the market during recovery. Also a listing on an exchange where it can get more volume. $4M daily volume is quite low.
2626 2018-01-25 20:13:28 Yes that’s what I mean
2627 2018-01-25 20:13:22 1) I have seen many #WEF panels and not all are great. But what the world had to witness today at 6pm in #Davos was embarrassing. Who was preparing this session? I really have no words. Yes, #blockchain is not an easy topic to understand and yes, WEF is not a crypto conference.

2632 2018-01-25 20:13:08 Is cryptocurrency related to science?
2633 2018-01-25 20:13:07 A working card, and an frictionless on ramp into crypto is all we users need to fully realize the potential of cryptocurrency as a finance replacement.
2634 2018-01-25 20:13:00 I found an amazing new project, #BreadToken #BreadWallet simply $BRD. So the bottom line is to create a decentralized crypto banking. I believe it is the one of the undervalued and low mc tokens out there. So much gap to grow.
2635 2018-01-25 20:12:57 Tearing my hair out waiting for something to happen! I might actually have to get on with some actual work soon!

2639 2018-01-25 20:12:40 The real question for @katyperry is what happens when her crypto nails have a fork...
2640 2018-01-25 20:12:35 Guys. This is a mockup... It's normal to fill it with content like this to show the potential use case. But it is not a "hidden message" that should show us there might be a partnership... Please. Nobody falls for this anymore. And it is not even funny to post.
2641 2018-01-25 20:12:29 was everyone THIS mad about a prefix getting turned into a noun before all this bitcoin madness ("crypto-" colloquially translating to "cryptography")
2642 2018-01-25 20:12:25 That's more of a digitization of existing FIAT or a tokenization if you like. Not a true crypto currency. But it could facilitate interaction between FIAT and crypto which is a big deal.
2643 2018-01-25 20:12:24 #PECUNIO offers multicurrency wallets and safe market access for all #Crypto market businesses via an easy-to-use interface. #ICO

2645 2018-01-25 20:12:17 WOW...Now I can track Crypto on the  @RobinhoodApp too? And soon buy and sell commission-free, this is really cool!
2646 2018-01-25 20:12:17 When the market is sideways, be thankful it isn't dipping. When the market is dipping be a thankful it isn't tanking.

2647 2018-01-25 20:12:12 Dont do it - it’s wrong and unethical. There is plenty of free information - we’ve all had to learn it and it’s not a big deal imo. When you charge money for the tiny bit of knowledge you have, ppl will likely think that you’re better than the free info out there. And you’re not

I didn't see any significant roll out of LTC asics until the end of 2017; network hash rate seems to agree with me. That was where I drew my misconception.

I'll buy LTC again when you do Charlie. Good luck.
2655 2018-01-25 20:11:47 Im long term bullish on $VIBE. While crypto is highly speculative the AR / VR industry is most definetly going to boom and become much more mainstream.
2656 2018-01-25 20:11:47 Bitcoin is a new kind of crypto money. Specially famous for black money untraceable transactions.

2661 2018-01-25 20:11:28 Good way to start investing in crypto is to buy ELF now @aelfblockchain
2662 2018-01-25 20:11:22 Ah yes the dumb arguments of crypto ethnic nationalists.
2663 2018-01-25 20:11:18 Nobody, crypto is high risk and unregulated, you knew this going into it.
2664 2018-01-25 20:11:17 Kinda makes me chuckle when Americans dismiss #Bitcoin or Crypto because it's not backed by anything...Last I checked,the #USD hasn't been backed by #Gold since 1971...But...
2665 2018-01-25 20:11:06 Good news, go go crypto
2666 2018-01-25 20:11:01 Most do not scale to the same level that a credit card provider would do (i.e. VISA). VISA does 56,000 transactions per second (peak) - instantly, no lag, no waiting. Until a crypto can do the same nothing will change.

2681 2018-01-25 20:10:11 I researched HITBTC & LIVECOIN exchanges. The comments and reviews are not comforting... e.g. locking wallets during arbitrage/ coin price differences across exchanges & withdraw issues. I'd like to buy. Just not comfortable.
2682 2018-01-25 20:10:10 Well done man... So, how is this done ? 
2683 2018-01-25 20:10:08 People live in dual realities, either they think crypto is going to the moon, or people think it's a fraud. Ignore the dumb pundits who think it's a fraud.

2685 2018-01-25 20:09:56 Think Jamie Dimon has lost a lot of credibility due to his negative thoughts on Bitcoin and then months later when the price was near the peak, he declared his warmth for the crypto currency.

2703 2018-01-25 20:08:35 all these Crypto genius make me laugh.  Their twitches are all losing money.  You know why? because they get you into shit coins. Don't day trade, buy good coins and wait.  #FCT #DGD #REP #GNT #POE - Everyone's a guru when every coin moons.
2704 2018-01-25 20:08:33 Thanks .....
2705 2018-01-25 20:08:24 Yeah true, however it's rather difficult to obtain stock if you dont have a Class A passport. Crypto allows anyone a piece of the pie. Wall street only hands out free money to men who resemble them
2706 2018-01-25 20:08:17 She doesn't seem like the shit posting type.
2707 2018-01-25 20:08:15 CRYCASH offers a threefold benefit:

1. It rewards gamers for game time with crypto that is transferable between games and is exchangable for fiat.
2708 2018-01-25 20:08:12 Oh yeah absolutely. When I look back at what happened in the last 7 months with $NEO, all of that price suppression was a massive bullish signal. I was just crapping myself at the time!

2711 2018-01-25 20:08:02 Predicted $ on annual summit?
2712 2018-01-25 20:08:02 This has nothing to do with what is best for the investor. This has to do with what is best for their company. They are unwilling to take the risk of loaning money to people to buy crypto, which is a completely fair risk management decision
2713 2018-01-25 20:08:02 90% on ven since 17 cents. Yolo haha.
2714 2018-01-25 20:08:01 While Ethereum is also fraudulent and useless, EtherZero and these redundant coins are equally so. Vitalik and his illegal securities offering have not helped crypto in the slightest.

2795 2018-01-25 20:01:11 The moment people are worried about crypto and think it's dead. #BTFD. $BTC $ETH $LTC
2796 2018-01-25 20:00:55 Whatever. Like no lawyer has never brought on a frivolous lawsuit. Being rude is not illegal. Noting that a person doesn't speak the language and can't do a job is not discrimination based on accent. Any logical person can see that.
2797 2018-01-25 20:00:53 Will you reveal your identity now? From the Santa Selfie I thought you were Arianna Simpson.
2798 2018-01-25 20:00:48 I think certain existing financial sectors will be dominated by new crypto companies. (like amazon took over shopping) It seems likely that in others the existing giants will adapt or adopt cryptocurrencies and the blockchain for their own use
2799 2018-01-25 20:00:43 SEC, CFTC Chiefs Eye Closer Crypto Scrutiny...
2800 2018-01-25 20:00:41 I’m back ! Crypto Currency is the future ! 
2801 2018-01-25 20:00:36 #BAT chart looking good. It went on a small run then dipped a little now preparing for another run. $TRX $XVG $ADA $BNB $APPC $TEL $BAT #Crypto #Altcoins
2802 2018-01-25 20:00:31 Lol I’m noticing the niggas into crypto are some real skirts moe..
2803 2018-01-25 20:00:30 I'm not saying nobody will pay.
I'm saying that new business models need to be found.

Copyright is like a proof of stake crypto: invest once and benefit your whole live time.

You need to find a proof of work model: you constantly need to reinvest (e.g. preforming live)

2827 2018-01-25 19:58:53 IBM president famously predicted home computers would never happen. A noted tech visionary predicted the internet would collapse by 1996. I'm studying Crypto-Currency initiatives because they are evolving at a record pace. Who knows where they will go, but I plan to be aware
2828 2018-01-25 19:58:52 Okay, thanks brother.
2829 2018-01-25 19:58:44 You lost money cuz you live in a hole
2830 2018-01-25 19:58:41 Gotta reapect that patience and discipline! I bought ven and icx right out of the gate at binance and that worked well. But i guess luck runs out at some point. Although with the hype, wan may not dip for a while
2831 2018-01-25 19:58:36 I just signed-up & installed robinhood through one of my friend’s referral link yesterday, so please excuse my ignorance... but I was under the impression @RobinhoodApp was strictly stocks (not crypto), no?
2832 2018-01-25 19:58:35 So 50cent forgot he had bitcoin, ended up being worth around 7.5-8 mil USD. And these cryptocurreny guru's telling him what to do with that money... Can't wait for this crypto bs to be over.
2833 2018-01-25 19:58:35 Lol 'gem' even tho it's a 900 market cap right now and a top 30 coin on day... Will need to get to 2 billion for a x2 lol
2834 2018-01-25 19:58:29 $Crypto is not for the faint hearted. Follow two rules and you'll be make it big in Crypto.
Rule 1: Don't invest what you can't loose.
Rule 2: Follow rule 1

2862 2018-01-25 19:56:27 Swiss based, well organized ICO, extremely good communication and, tadaaa, a working product with real world adaption in supply chain management
2863 2018-01-25 19:56:23 Anyone who cites The Sun as news source clearly has no credibility

2865 2018-01-25 19:56:13 I've always said it and will keep reiterating it. The to learn when delving into $Crypto trading is neither TA or FA, the first thing go learn is how to conquer your emotions.
2866 2018-01-25 19:56:13 My thoughts on #Crypto for the week. There is a solid chance that w/ many people looking to do some major spending for #LunarNewYear  that prices will see a bit of a dip..but hey it's a buyers market, right ? What are your thoughts? #cryptocurrency
2867 2018-01-25 19:55:59 Agreed.  Some of the scenes look like an PlayStation game background.  Maybe sit the performers in cars or put viewers in a concert arena - on their own, free to walk around 
2868 2018-01-25 19:55:57 I support May in her efforts to stop bit coin cryptocurrencies. It's named crypto for a reason. It allows transactions cryptically. If you have something to hide you would look to buy/sell with bitcoins. An educated 'guess' and we will step back into ABUSE in all its colours. No?
2869 2018-01-25 19:55:56 I have sold trx. and all in iost. to moon tonight i hope

2876 2018-01-25 19:55:22 yeah they're fine. I spoke with them before during and after the fork.
2877 2018-01-25 19:55:21 You didn't listen. Because this whole pointless debate seems to stem from you thinking I said the majority support trump. Still waiting. Really, don't come back until you can find where I said that.

2885 2018-01-25 19:54:56 I missed the ICO as well and personally won't touch it unless it dips, stays stagnant, and I can see exactly what my entry point is.
2886 2018-01-25 19:54:48 Maybe you should stop the weather thing, you got a crypto talent, do that instead.

2895 2018-01-25 19:54:02 What I plan to say in my videos about crypto will be my own OPINION. I want to really emphasize that I'm not an expert, but I'm not a complete idiot either. I want these videos to be educational, while also entertaining. I don't sit on a bed of lambos, I live in a college dorm.

2915 2018-01-25 19:52:35 @CryptoChoe Hey Eric, I just wanted to draw your attention to ICX's dropping volume. Unfortunately it would seem like the crypto crowd loses interest very fast once an announcement has been made, however significant.. I wanna believe but may pull out while still in profit..
2916 2018-01-25 19:52:34 They cant run it down. They need to make some money too... they eventually will have to long it
2917 2018-01-25 19:52:28 When does the weekly close?
2918 2018-01-25 19:52:27 Someone said that without a degree of anonymity crypto will has no value. Just wondering if this could be true??
2919 2018-01-25 19:52:26 Any advice for peeps that missed the ico!! It’ll most like launch at 10x+. Zilliga was doing 14x earlier today
2920 2018-01-25 19:52:25 I can't imagine placing a crypto trade w/o hedging for a ton of growth... because that's practically all that happens 83% of the time. In crypto it's not considered growth unless you have ATH or close to it

2929 2018-01-25 19:51:33 Fact is crypto will now present a way for other political parties to gain votes and bury @theresa_may and her tory cronies. @UKLabour should take advantage and be at the forefront of this emerging tech.
2930 2018-01-25 19:51:33 So you have to have 500k BTR to set up a masternode? First Crypto I'm dealing with that has a masternode
2931 2018-01-25 19:51:28 That being said, I am by no means an expert in the crypto space. I am still a very young adult (20) and I am very new to all of this, However, I am eager to learn and if I can take you all along with me during that process, I truly believe together we can learn and really grow.

2935 2018-01-25 19:51:11 #CRYPTO is the expectation
2936 2018-01-25 19:51:09 Robinhood will offer Zero FEE crypto trading to compete with @coinbase
2937 2018-01-25 19:51:08 ¡Hola, Twitter! #miprimerTweet
2938 2018-01-25 19:51:08 Bedtime stories will be white papers.. and then some shilling.
2939 2018-01-25 19:51:05 Still a big buy wall here...just waiting
2940 2018-01-25 19:51:01 I don't hodl USD... It's war money. I have to spend Crypto to eat, live and interact with the world.
2941 2018-01-25 19:50:51 Ten mins to go... who’s watching @ThePledge tonight? Starts 8pm on @slyness Sadly I’m at a #crypto event so can’t watch. Let me know what you think about it 
2942 2018-01-25 19:50:50 You can't go wrong with this crypto. I can see it being  .50 cents within the next 5 years ("within") could be as early as next year or the year after. There WILL be turbulence along the way but this should be a fun crypto flight 
2943 2018-01-25 19:50:49 Olay yavaş yavaş unutulmaya başlayınca twitter a döndü.Yapmayın adamı kaçıracaksınız sonra. Üslup ustasından bizi mahrum bırakmayın.
2944 2018-01-25 19:50:41 Not to mention.... China is not in on the Crypto exchange. Making it nothing like forex for the Asian session.
2945 2018-01-25 19:50:37 Ça vaut le coup vue que tu ne dépense 0€ haha
2946 2018-01-25 19:50:37 Newbies see the price of crypto drop and panic. Selling what they can to cover losses. Real investors know that’s the time to buy more. #hodl #crypto. Buy low. Sell high. HODL through the dips.

2950 2018-01-25 19:50:30 Our 500 billion USD market cap should not buy @Samsung anymore because of hostile Korean Goverment vs Crypto Currency. They act like we are criminals, while we innovate a transparent future to include the other 6 billion people with #fintech and inclusive innovation. #bitcoin
2951 2018-01-25 19:50:27 The joke is that people put their money into "Ponzicoin" and were surprised someone stole the money. Not that all crypto is a joke.
2952 2018-01-25 19:50:26 I wonder:

Has anyone called crypto traders that don't trade stocks.

2954 2018-01-25 19:50:03 Blockchain and crypto is going to make people rich, and then kill everyone. There is no stopping it because the globalized world culture worships infertility and death, and prizes cheap profit over human life. If you hop on now, and understand the tech, you might survive.

2966 2018-01-25 19:49:07 Kind of like to keep it to kids , pets and crypto. Politics and religion  
2967 2018-01-25 19:49:04 I really wish the crypto speculators and hopeful 'everyday users' could come together and actually make a concerted effort to begin using these currencies for their intended use... as a method of payment.
2968 2018-01-25 19:49:01 Sorun yok onaylamasın ben böyle mutluyum ufak bir exe yazdım hergün aynı saatte aktarıyor :) tradeyle geri çıkıyor aktardığı 
2969 2018-01-25 19:49:01 From a European perspective - crypto is wildly overjoyed, Musk is phenomenal - a force of nature, and seed rounds of $25m are dumb - always reminded of @bchesky talking about how constraints force creativity
2970 2018-01-25 19:48:59 Crypto behaves much different than forex right now. The Institutional and Algo traders are not in the game full swing. Crypto is very very basic for the time being. Just buy the dip sell the tip and keep your hand strong. ETH is doing quite well for me =D
2971 2018-01-25 19:48:54 Just because Robinhood says it's zero fee doesn't actually mean it's zero fee.. they can't do in the crypto markets what they traditionally do in equity markets because of the lack of lending available, so they'll likely disguise the fees through a spread.
2972 2018-01-25 19:48:47 Thanks for the info man. I got ur trading course the other day. Great info! I also got the book you recommended reminiscences of a stock operator. I'm hoping to trade crypto full time soon, prolly going to join the chat soon. Thanks again.
2973 2018-01-25 19:48:42 .@RobinhoodApp crypto feature seems half baked. Can't add different coins, and the only way to access crypto section is through a notification. Maybe  access is just being rolled out slowly?

2991 2018-01-25 19:46:41 That’s as telling a label as any! Yes, crypto currencies are certainly a creative trend. And now that they have been born, the idea behind them is creative enough that they will reappear from here to eternity afflicting successive generations of humans, from time to time.
2992 2018-01-25 19:46:29 We are going to be selling shitcoins to your grand kids. Crypto ain’t going anywhere but up

2994 2018-01-25 19:46:24 There's some node issues wrt to exchanges at the mo that will hopefully be resolved soon. A crypto with no fees, instant transactions and a comparatively tiny carbon footprint is certainly marketable going forward. #XRB
2995 2018-01-25 19:46:21 The founders actually donated a lot of their coins. Thats why Bill and Melinda Gates partnered with them. True crypto enthusiasts are what’s killing BTC. Hence why they are being dropped as a payment method. What happens when there’s not enough hash power? Blockchain halts 
2996 2018-01-25 19:46:12 @theresa_may has just found a quicker way to fund global terrorism.
2997 2018-01-25 19:46:11 Can you elaborate on why crypto markets react differently to new information than other markets?
2998 2018-01-25 19:46:10 Only certain thing about crypto-currency is that no matter when you sell you will regret it. If you do not sell you will also regret this. 
2999 2018-01-25 19:46:03 Welcome to the wonderful world of crypto!  There's a wonderful group of women in our community to greet your arrival :) ♡
3000 2018-01-25 19:46:01 Wait till bitcoin gets out of the 11k-12k bubble and reaches 15-20k. This coin will probably be the first one to sky rocket 100% within hours... This crypto has been handling market crashes unaffected. As strong as my intuition is I'm sticking with dimecoin the next 5 to 10 years
3001 2018-01-25 19:45:49 Lol that’s gotta hurt
3002 2018-01-25 19:45:49 I think you forgot to mention @DigiByteCoin in the list.
Please do xheck out this coin. I have never seen anything more secure and faster than this tech!
3003 2018-01-25 19:45:45 You have my attention
3004 2018-01-25 19:45:45 Hahah. Rip.
3005 2018-01-25 19:45:39 Just because you've been in crypto for X years doesn't make you special kid.
3006 2018-01-25 19:45:38 Such strong communities in $crave and $smart, even just chatting on dischord to all types of people from users to devs... 
V excited to see where these coins go it's gonna be huge

3009 2018-01-25 19:45:15 as i said it will go down too. But it's not a crypto currency
3010 2018-01-25 19:45:05 Ohno don´t get me wrong, I have always been into alts, even through dips and held them, recovered, I agree with you just looking for some more to take into Portfolio :) Spreading can´t be wrong.
3011 2018-01-25 19:45:02 I’m invested heavily in crypto ranch
3012 2018-01-25 19:44:56 Crypto distracts me from girls and @Hotkatchina distracts me from cryptos. I’m stuck in this feedback loop  but I like it...
3013 2018-01-25 19:44:52 @YS what’s a best crypto if I plan to invest in SIP model?
3014 2018-01-25 19:44:51 close. 12.8
3015 2018-01-25 19:44:50 Honestly, I’m jealous that I didnt become one a year ago. Many became millionaires with a very small investment in crypto. Percentage gains are much, much, much higher in crypto.
3016 2018-01-25 19:44:49 Fax 
3017 2018-01-25 19:44:46 The argument that governments being in crypto is a negative is so stupid. Obviously people haven’t been scammed before but millions if not billions have been made from scam coins and businesses. Stopping fraudulent ICOs and exchanges is a good thing.
3018 2018-01-25 19:44:45 What's wrong with that...
3019 2018-01-25 19:44:43 Yeah, let’s hope that’s what they mean. If it takes a week for actual transfers, I can’t imagine many people would use. I know I wouldn’t.

3065 2018-01-25 19:40:46 I don‘t differentiate between a founder and a company backing the ICO/crypto. I think you’re more unlikely to succeed eg in the payments space, if you distribute all your tokens to impatient retail speculators at ICO vs banks/payment providers at a later stage.

3067 2018-01-25 19:40:36 I put my money in privacy based cryptocurrencies and in coins transitioning into smart contract based platforms. Even with the market contractions, I doubled my money. I don't get the jokes. Crypto will replace everything and then the gov will take it over.

3078 2018-01-25 19:39:54 Don’t miss out on $nuls. This #altcoin is considered to be heavily under valued at the moment. I’d say at least get a few of them.

3082 2018-01-25 19:39:40 $BTSC is a good example of the potential that $GHHC holds. $BTSC is involved in the mining of Bitcoin and other crypto currencies, and also offers Bitcoin escrow service. Further, it also develops and sells blockchain software. In the last one-year, the stock has gained by 3350%.

3085 2018-01-25 19:39:30 You are a shining light in a twitter feed full of five aways and terrible investment advice! We have to disregard these coins going for a money grab and focus on actual real world use of crypto currencies. #crypto #cryptocurrency
3086 2018-01-25 19:39:29 Your a true Aussie hero!!
3087 2018-01-25 19:39:22 It's all the crypto mining

3089 2018-01-25 19:39:16 If I could go back and change one thing about my #crypto investment experience so far, it would be to tell my past self first investing in crypto currency to focus more on passive income strategies, and using what I made in that to delve deeper into other coin investments.
3090 2018-01-25 19:39:16 i did make an account. Now i have sent over BTC but didnot receive them. How long will it takes?
3091 2018-01-25 19:39:15 Dude. Why not let the people know where the action is? Rather then let them set in something that may be going down smh . Bye
3092 2018-01-25 19:39:14 RobinHood is gonna be big, and a good thing for crypto. No doubt
3093 2018-01-25 19:39:03 Crypto + hot chicks = winning combination

3096 2018-01-25 19:38:40 What if we've entered another boring/sideways period in the crypto markets? I don't mean days or even weeks.  But, perhaps months or years of BTC bouncing around the same price like it did in 2015/16.
3097 2018-01-25 19:38:34 Engineering had tradeoffs.

If a crypto advertises all it's advantages over Bitcoin without disclosing the tradeoffs, they're not being honest.
3098 2018-01-25 19:38:32 The husband and wife team that didn't need any crypto currencies.

3103 2018-01-25 19:38:22 @KanavBhalla - Hi Mr Bhalla! Crypto fan of yours on YouTube. Thank you for your daily guide of information.  Question- would you ever set up a group ICO and other coins investment group for us followers to invest in?  Everyone puts in $100 a month?
3104 2018-01-25 19:38:11 Met the team at their office warming last week. Excited to see what they build. An index in crypto is definitely more of an INDEX*

*Excludes scams, coins with less than $___ trading volume, etc.
3105 2018-01-25 19:38:11 so it is not like you will throw bunch of unfolded clothes then it will come out nice and folded. so you have to manually feed the robot a cloth and make sure it fits precisely in the handles. Might be useful for textile industries not for household , unless you invented 1#Crypto
3106 2018-01-25 19:38:02 Staying ahead of the game is crucial. It's my opinion that the days ahead are bloody. Therefore, I am selling off big alt bags that are performing well to buy back lower, will be looking for the right price to sell some $BTC to bb lower, and have my bitmex short ready. #crypto
3107 2018-01-25 19:38:02 Not sure if you remember, but I asked you about Zilliqua on the Super Chat about a month ago. What do you think of Zil?
3108 2018-01-25 19:38:01 If you are looking for a great crypto youtube channel, I suggest you give @Altcoinbuzzio a follow. They offer trading info, prospective coins, new ico's and overall market knowledge. Videos are released daily and are current with market trends. #cryptocurrency #Crypto #BTC #HODL
3109 2018-01-25 19:37:58 I guess you can argue about adoption, not functionality, which is limited at this time. But guess what? This is an exponential process, not linear. Think about internet’s adoption rate and multiply it by 1000. This is what’s going to happen with crypto. The battle is won already!

Poker + Crypto = Deadly Combination
3112 2018-01-25 19:37:45 But isn’t the current future volume in btc still very small ? Im not sure to call this a “Win” yet 
3113 2018-01-25 19:37:45 Trading kin on CoinFalcon...
3114 2018-01-25 19:37:45 I know for a fact that this the majority if not 120% the shared mutual feeling across the Crypto community. They don't want us to win but the inevitable will come, rest assured... Power back to the people!
3115 2018-01-25 19:37:38 watch out for the next hours :) it will be 14 cents by the end of next week - 31th Jan. will be another great day for #icx $icx
3116 2018-01-25 19:37:19 Ironically, being a universal base pair for crypto *is* a good use case lol.

It still has the most hash power, the most security, a lot of developers.. While that's the case, it will remain important.

As btc bleeds, alts will rise. They won't move together long.
3117 2018-01-25 19:37:07 This is really amazing idea. #blockchain #BETRbetting Your missions make me feel confident when investing in it. #BETR #crypto
3118 2018-01-25 19:37:05 I love this project, yet I don't have two years.
3119 2018-01-25 19:36:59 If #Bitcoin stays a bit longer in consolidation, I´ll hop into those sort of #altcoins for now, cause Im one of those believers, #BTC is not gonna crash to $8k, I do simply not see the strong supports (especially those from whales) crumbling like dry cookies.
3120 2018-01-25 19:36:52 I can hear the $xvg community whining they're not on that list

You: Well, for starters I have some Phore nodes and-
Bank: Say no more, just take whatever you need from the vault.
3123 2018-01-25 19:36:40 You should write an article regarding taxes on bitcoin. It seems you are very interested in this crypto-currency
3124 2018-01-25 19:36:38 The use of the phase industry is dubious surely we are more of a collective! I agree with a significant amount of your teachings however I think the conversation on wide spread actually use commercially of crypto is important rather than investment advice. #leveraging
3125 2018-01-25 19:36:36 JustX
3126 2018-01-25 19:36:18 Well if anything it's important for peeps just getting into crypto to realise that sorry no suger coating here:
1. Exchanges go bust (u lose it all) 
2. ICO's turn out to be fake (u lose it all) 
3. Tokens /Currencies can hit ZERO (u lose it all) 
4. Wallet hacked (u lose it all)
3127 2018-01-25 19:36:11 Ripple is getting boring, let's see tomorrow what brings the  Q4 fingers crossed.  I bought stellar when the price was $0.37. I hope it keeps growing I have invested in others like Tron, redd coin, Verge , Xem and of course pac Coin. Let see u never know with Crypto.
3128 2018-01-25 19:36:08 First

3131 2018-01-25 19:35:48 oops xD
3132 2018-01-25 19:35:44 Looking forward!
3133 2018-01-25 19:35:40 Me too ~ probably have too much butttt I got in at a decent time so my portfolio remains optimistic, haha  I’m also into pretty big into crypto, but that’s even more dramatic (both ways). Having fun and learning a lot though

3138 2018-01-25 19:34:53 Found a Coursera course on Fibonacci. Kind of silly to be investing in crypto and not have a full mathematical understanding of how to invest right.
3139 2018-01-25 19:34:52 what you mean?
3140 2018-01-25 19:34:33 いやー、忘れてました
3141 2018-01-25 19:34:29 I've been cutting my losses in trx slowly lol. Crypto pains
3142 2018-01-25 19:34:20 One of my February 2018 targets will be to understand crypto currencies and Bitcoin in particular. Hv ignored this animal for too long
3143 2018-01-25 19:33:54 @coinbase just took an arrow to the knee...Thank you @RobinhoodApp. $BTC $ETH $LTC $XRP $BCH
3144 2018-01-25 19:33:52 @TradingAcademy used a tip I learned from an OTAMpls session last week to turn a 20% crypto profit in less than a day!!!
3145 2018-01-25 19:33:51 What?! You can’t buy a pizza with Bitcoin? Or a 50Cent hiphop album? Or a car? Or a house? A donation is not possible in crypto? Am I back in time, or you just woke up after you have been cryogenated in the 90’?! Are you sure we are talking about the same Bitcoin?
3146 2018-01-25 19:33:51 U r still a noob to crypto. Lol
3147 2018-01-25 19:33:48 @RobinhoodApp i already trade in Robinhood, do i still need to sign up for crypto part of it ? How does it work ?
3148 2018-01-25 19:33:46 dont dox urself

3150 2018-01-25 19:33:42 I believe he uses TradeNavigator. Perhaps he'll confirm whether that's still the case.
3151 2018-01-25 19:33:38 Alright, now I'm fully back and I can concentrate on crypto 100%. Let's make 2018 the best year ever! HODL and gather all the $CRYPTO you can with us! (I heard it's cool now to address myself as "we" or "us")
3152 2018-01-25 19:33:30 I think it's funny how #TRON was pumped to 25 cent and then the company sold 6 billion tron around this time and rhe price plummeted to 7 cent! I guess somone at tron sold 7 billion tron at 25~30 cent and earned a billion dollars over night crashing the price! #TRX #crypto #BTC
3153 2018-01-25 19:33:25 Yeah
3154 2018-01-25 19:33:25 The company's work is transparent to investors. It is very good. We are waiting for new tweets!
3155 2018-01-25 19:33:15 So I gave 4 BTC to a friend who is new in crypto. 4 Days have passed since then and he gave me 4.6 BTC back and made 2 himself. Fucking impressive!!! $btc #btc
3156 2018-01-25 19:33:08 Except.... Not... Otherwise youd have.... Evidence.

3158 2018-01-25 19:32:58 I work 90 hrs a week besides this. #Crypto is just a hobby. I am not a financial advisor or even can I claim to be a pro, but at least I can point other people in the right direction.

3166 2018-01-25 19:32:19 Robinhood introducing their crypto app is huge. Use their app for stocks, very simple, easy and free. Will open the door to many new users. Exciting times ahead.
3167 2018-01-25 19:32:17 Definitely like the $OST chart, it was primed to make a run, been charting it for the last couple days watching it get ready to break out.
3168 2018-01-25 19:31:52 Did the same thing in April. Liquidated my RH portfolio, moved it all to crypto.
3169 2018-01-25 19:31:45 @Crypto_Brahma Thank you for the $TRAC #OriginTrail recommendation, I entered lightly and took my initial profits and now i can afford to see my family after exams and get myself a new PSU, Keep it up mate :)

3178 2018-01-25 19:31:14 Huh
3179 2018-01-25 19:31:10 Features mean nothing. Nada. Wuat mattered was constant fud over btc/crypto that culminated with Korean inside trading and dumping millions worth of btc on 15th of Jan.

Cant do TA without taking into acc news and sentiment of people. BTC is never going under 9k.
3180 2018-01-25 19:31:06 In #crypto, sometimes it’s time to make hay, and sometimes it’s time to chill out and listen to @ChrisStapleton and just do nothing. If you’ve got all positions that excite you in place I suggest the latter.
3181 2018-01-25 19:31:04 Foreal.  Over here hustlin crypto n shit 
3182 2018-01-25 19:30:43 $BTC #Crypto doesn't run

3184 2018-01-25 19:30:28 Definitely hyped. But interesting that crypto will give AI the legal basis (binding consent) to disrupt significant advisory practices (legal, medical, accounting, ...)
3185 2018-01-25 19:30:26 Xrp was not vested to be a crypto currency. You could use it as a currency but that was not the purpose.
Xrp was created to work as a high effecient transaction tool. 
Banks maybe do not want digital currencies, but they want tools to work more effective to save money.
3186 2018-01-25 19:30:23 Need proof of that
3187 2018-01-25 19:30:23 Absolutely want options and regular equity trading as one account and prefer crypto on same accojnt if possible.
3188 2018-01-25 19:30:12 bad for the legit ones in Crypto ! Glad there gone sorry for the sheep that got slaughtered!
3189 2018-01-25 19:30:11 Being excessively emotional spells disaster in both trading, short/long term investing. What helps a bit? Logic, skepticism, "detachment", rational thinking.
3190 2018-01-25 19:30:10 Are my rounded spectacles offset enough to be a legitimate authority on crypto?

3222 2018-01-25 19:27:59 Can you explain why the market crashes after futures expire? Right now Jan futures are trading at 11125, pretty close to exchange prices (~11200). So if institutions are going long futures and shorting BTC, what's the rationale behind an expected flash crash? Thanks

3230 2018-01-25 19:27:29 why would you wanna use it anyways? all they're gonna have is $BTC and $ETH and just in five U.S states. free trading is nice, but this seems just like a way to get noobs/weak hands into the market.
3231 2018-01-25 19:27:25 How to exercise the power  of saying  no in the crypto universe. 
1. Don't invest into every cryptocurrency that you might believe will become profitable. 
2. Get your self about the subject.
3. Plan your every day assessment of the visions your investing into.

3235 2018-01-25 19:27:15 Wel, I guess regulators are smart enough to not only regulate Bitcoin, but find a broad enough definition that captures Crypto“currencies“ as a whole
3236 2018-01-25 19:27:15 With robinhood charging 0% fees I suspect other exchanges may drop there % on xchages. All depends how much volume passes through there site #crypto
3237 2018-01-25 19:27:07 I think I’ve seen the word ‘crypto’ more times today than I ever have in my life.
3238 2018-01-25 19:27:01 following
3239 2018-01-25 19:27:00 It is a different case; #bitcoin is the gold standard for crypto. It might not be the trading currency but the reference one.
2018 will be a major year for crypto; no flying under the radar anymore.
3240 2018-01-25 19:27:00 I like this project, I'll contribute a lot to the world of Crypto currency!!
3241 2018-01-25 19:26:58 If someone wants to get rid of some #BTC....

3253 2018-01-25 19:25:34 No one has answered the big question. Will you be able to transfer crypto out of Robinhood? If not, this is no replacement for Coinbase.
3254 2018-01-25 19:25:23 Crypto has a lot of unknown unknowns.

It's rational to be conservative and observe.
3255 2018-01-25 19:25:19 @AskRobinhood will you make it possible to transfer crypto coins from coinbase to Robinhood?
3256 2018-01-25 19:25:08 Because hive project its working hard on product development, and making partnerships, and opening market for hive tokens. Sure, when they have all, they will start to making real marketing, and this will be very very huge. Will be the fist cryptocurrency for use on real life!

3267 2018-01-25 19:23:53 I cannot recommend any other crypto lending platforms out there to anyone aside from Hedgeconnect. For people who are saying it's a scam - it is because they are scammed by one and I pity them for generalizing this industry. That is what you call crab mentality and bitterness.
3268 2018-01-25 19:23:50 I am short term choppish - we do have at least a nice upward retrace coming, whenenever it decides to do it

3278 2018-01-25 19:22:50 Regardless, when LTC gets actual usage comparable to BTC, it will hit the same bottleneck with 1MB blocks.

3284 2018-01-25 19:22:18 $TRX looks to be breaking resistance in the next three days with any luck. Big announcements continually pushing the market and really solid depth of market (the best even) in the crypto market.

3300 2018-01-25 19:20:05 BTC is not gold. It's a value transfer protocol. LTC is not silver. It's a slightly higher capacity payment protocol that its only developer doesn't believe it's worth having skin in the game for.

Gold and silver have real world uses that make them a store of value without fees.

3313 2018-01-25 19:18:51 The worst service in the crypto industry. Coinbase have been left behind, bitstamp and etoro provide a better service. Coinbase are not to be seen when support is needed. Out of the billions that have been put in, ask all the customers what they think when they try to take out.

3321 2018-01-25 19:17:55 Everyone knew it was a scam. The  #BCC scam going away is good for crypto long term.
3322 2018-01-25 19:17:55 Not gonna corner me into proving a negative for every delusion you spout.
3323 2018-01-25 19:17:52 I know!  Think the Big 3 will see a pretty big push especially with updates. Of course it is also a bit scary as the crypto space will no longer be exactly what it was intended for.  
3324 2018-01-25 19:17:51 True. Inversely related.
3325 2018-01-25 19:17:49 The difference is that people that suck at skiing are already aware that they stink. The mountain keeps them humble. Many crypto newbs show up and think they're experts after 3 months because they 10x.
3326 2018-01-25 19:17:49 Any chance of sharing which coins you are daytrading?
3327 2018-01-25 19:17:42 Of course he didn’t.  Nor did he do the basic math on 700 BTC at today’s prices.
3328 2018-01-25 19:17:26 Lee plainly stated if you can't handle $20 LTC, then maybe LTC isn't for you. Profit is defintely on his mind, that's why he dumped on his followers on the way up.

If he cared about profits now then he should buy some more again yes?

He said he has no intention of rebuying.
3329 2018-01-25 19:17:19 Taxing crypto usage is like taxing for software usage. It's ridiculous and opens a very dangerous precedent. Crypto to Crypto "exchange" is like exchanging email. It's just software communicating through a network, nothing more.
3330 2018-01-25 19:17:19 How'd I miss this?
3331 2018-01-25 19:17:01 I KNOW some are better than others at $crypto TA, but I just love seeing some folks talkin' like, "Well $btc price could go up past where it is or down below where it is. It could even go higher than it was or lower than it used to be. Exciting times, exciting times. Triangle."
3332 2018-01-25 19:16:52 It’s most likely Robinhood seeing they just started exchanging crypto today
3333 2018-01-25 19:16:48 I am not a #Republican but I must say that I feel like #DonaldTrump is the best thing to happen to #bitcoin and #cryptocurrencies. I may be wrong but I can't help but think that the #Democrats would have strangled the life out of #Crypto with over regulations.

3337 2018-01-25 19:16:12 I have used robinhood for stocks and I loved your app. I can't wait until the new crypto app.
3338 2018-01-25 19:16:12 Needs more exposure! The addition of a new major exchange at the end of Q1 will definitely increase it at least to $0.50! We just have to be patient because their team and technology will do the rest $HVN @hiveproject_net

3344 2018-01-25 19:15:43 So excited...
3345 2018-01-25 19:15:38 already listed on #Bibox, I think we could see #binance or #bittrex sooner rather than later. One can hope. Volume picking up nicely. The team behind the project is enough to invest alone. Feeling confident about this one going into mid 2018
3346 2018-01-25 19:15:30 So... what happens when CME futures expire tomorrow Jan 26th?
3347 2018-01-25 19:15:28 yes, I believe that also. no problem, wow thats nice of you to say! thanks, I truly appreciate that! good luck on your crypto journey!
3348 2018-01-25 19:15:25 Capital One blocks purchases of crypto currency from any agency and provides no means of lifting this block. Canceling #capitalone
3349 2018-01-25 19:15:21 Definitely I agree on the strategy. I don't think most crypto investors are nearly diversified enough given the risks of any one chain. There's a distinct bias towards incumbents that isn't borne out for me by the likelihood some or all of those top coins will be outpaced

3371 2018-01-25 19:13:14 Delusion complex possibly. Well, I find myself in the middle, a crypto-centerist if the label exists. I am new and started reading about BTC in Dec 2016, made my first tx Mar 2017, and been buying up shitcoins since! Not into paid groups, made that mistake on Scottrade.
3372 2018-01-25 19:13:11 Was a genius maneuver on the part of @RobinhoodApp (I made it in at the 70k mark)
3373 2018-01-25 19:13:09 We don't expect you to fix this overnight,but the wallet has been offline again since around the 14th Jan. Just some word about what you are doing to fix this issue and any prediction ( however how long it may be)will stop people having to keep asking & would restore confidence??
3374 2018-01-25 19:13:08 Hey crypto & DLT folks. How bout we all agree to give more meaningful file names than 'whitepaper.pdf'???
3375 2018-01-25 19:13:06 Lost me at the arbitrage mention.
3376 2018-01-25 19:13:06 So what is Cobinhood then? I thought that was like the Robinhood crypto app. Never bothered looking further than the name though.

3380 2018-01-25 19:12:28 Please try giving “Tripping Over the Truth: The Metabolic Theory of Cancer” by Travis Christopherson.  I’d recommend to anyone to give it a read.  Follow it up with “The Obesity Code” by Jason Fung (not that your obese).  Knowledge on the role carbs and sugar play in our bodies.
3381 2018-01-25 19:12:26 @Haejin_Crypto  just curious if you had already addressed the concern that the market could take a huge hit due to the authorities wanting to start regulating the cryptos? Could the entire market be seized? Or is it still presumed that market will recover as it always after Jan?
3382 2018-01-25 19:12:20 You made 120k on what invested amount? If I may ask, cause that's where the interesting part is - what's 120k was percentage-wise to initial trade cost.
3383 2018-01-25 19:12:13 That market won't be a market for BCH though, BCH doesn't take the lead in any shape or form in crypto, be it a store of value, transaction costs or speed, when crypto goes mainstream only the top survive.
3384 2018-01-25 19:12:07 LTC’s whole purpose is silver to gold. That’s been the vision the entire time. Check out LTC’s roadmap and you’ll see smart contracts and colored coins in 2018. Hardly a failure.

3414 2018-01-25 19:08:46 on youtube I have a bunch of unwatched videos about crypto and blockchain.  I will watch them when all that becomes sexy again.
3415 2018-01-25 19:08:39 I have nothing against you. We each have our own way of getting the word out. But you said a couple days ago that you would tell me about your next favorite coin if I retweeted your post. I'm still waiting for the name. I will be a better friend if you follow thru 
3416 2018-01-25 19:08:35 There is no doubt in the future alt coins are going to be used for peer to peer transactions coz they are much cheaper and faster but Bitcoin is going to be used as a store of  value its actually a healthy sign that bitcoin is consolidating, bcoz rn its too big market cap

3425 2018-01-25 19:08:01 Yes - not when you HAVE to when you can, while you’re still in profit. That’s what a stop loss is for.

3429 2018-01-25 19:07:31 #LN is rolling out, the real dislike for #BCASH is  that a small hand full of people own most of the total supply. That small hand full of people like "Roger" no one really likes or wants to support.  Thirdly #BCASH is over priced relative its usage, for payments #LTC better
3430 2018-01-25 19:07:29 Lost a lot of money rn in crypto. Like a LOT. But making it back is easy. It was my fault to buy a shit coin
3431 2018-01-25 19:07:28 Not an avid follower or ADA hodler, this tweet made me more supportive of Cardano, that it is the real deal. It makes me believe your project is actually aiming at creating new, special value in crypto, not just pump yourself with BTC FUD like oh so many do.
3432 2018-01-25 19:07:17 Katy Perry refused in 2013 a private convert  from a fan which as proposed 1000 Bitcoins, she said no, and when  Bitcoin get at 1k$ she claimed to regret, and today seems all those tweets and story disapeared from her twitter, why dear Katy ?

3435 2018-01-25 19:06:52 Xrp is most likely even though I don't like it, but it is backed by banks.  Eth seems to be the goto platform for innovation in crypto field based on how it's structured.  After that I focus more on equities tied to cryptos, like OSTK, TEUM and forthcoming etfs tracking crypto
3436 2018-01-25 19:06:38 Robinhood is introducing bitcoin/crypto trading which means every newb with $500 that hasn’t already lost money on BTC will get their chance, commission free of course!

3439 2018-01-25 19:06:20 My point was that the intention behind creating LTC was to make an asic resistant payment coin.

Bitmain developed LTC asics this year, and Charlie Lee sold all his LTC a few months later while publically brigading how noble it makes him to remove the conflict of interest.
3440 2018-01-25 19:06:20 whats stopping you from getting a x10 on a coin with a masternode? Afterall, it is one of the reasons why coins go x10.

3442 2018-01-25 19:06:18 Not sure what's driving the #btc price up, looked like we were going towards 10,600, some resistance now at a previously tedious spot, 11,300, after a sluggished rebound off 11, I still think we're headed back down but less sure now #crypto

THANKS IN ADVANCE.
3444 2018-01-25 19:06:06 Disagree with the tracking argument. Once you behold a wallet, you can create as many crypto directions as you want. That just makes it pretty hard to track any transaction you make, doesn't it ...?
Fully agree with the energy argument, and cost-efficient mining pools nontheless
3445 2018-01-25 19:06:03 "Because, y'know, we can't just allow people to duplicate assets"

It's a fork! , Thats a major part of how crypto currency works.
3446 2018-01-25 19:06:02 These videos of yours are so likable. The editing and entertainment rather then chatting non-stop in front of coinmarketcap. Really appreciate the extra effort. Keep it up.
3447 2018-01-25 19:06:00 Road map is great, but they need much more in marketing budget #cryptocurrency #crypto #hive
3448 2018-01-25 19:05:58 I disagree. South Korea is now allowing crypto just regulating. Seems that most governments are going in same direction. Bitcoin seems pretty stable rt now and I think is going to go on a run soon. It has great support further above 10,000 now which is calming to people

3458 2018-01-25 19:04:38 @DeepOnionx remains my choice as it is a result of a well rounded development project. With many governments on the war path against #crypto traders they will all want to stay #anonymous and protect their #privacy but most other coins are easily traceable.
3459 2018-01-25 19:04:28 The whole #Crypto markets taking a dive. In less than 2 months #Xrp has gone from $0.20 to $1.3 and seems to be steadying. That’s still a large increase.
It went up to $3 based on the whole market being in a bull run and speculation of Coinbase. Patience is needed.
3460 2018-01-25 19:04:27 The thing about payment processors is they are not just sellers.  There is a buyer on the other end.

Running a payment processor is basically a way for someone to accumulate crypto by brokering transactions between merchants and crypto earners.

Well then, thank god it was created at all because the cat is out of the bag, and no crypto currency has EVER given the user so much power over their own wealth before in all of history.
3474 2018-01-25 19:02:54 The company behind the wepower already have agreements with European Union and green energy producers. This is the visible part which creates hype 40000+ telegram channel however. They are selling kwh with tokens much more expensive than current kwh price. ROI 3yrs.

3483 2018-01-25 19:02:15 Zero value? I just told your followers how to go from "gambling" to "investing".

Gambling = Buying a coin only on 1 or 2 tiny exchanges with the hope that it becomes widely adopted

Investing = Buying a coin with a terrific TEAM, PRODUCTS, PARTNERSHIPS, AND BACKERS.  $OST
3484 2018-01-25 19:02:08 @CryptoNickk
3485 2018-01-25 19:02:06 And ETH = Ethereum? Therefore a non cash purchase that would not necessarily be reported in a Form D filing by $OSTK? Is it typical for ICO buyers to use crypto to buy into a new offering?
3486 2018-01-25 19:01:55 It’s simple. Very few people care about technology and future. People are greedy and want to make money NOW.

3507 2018-01-25 18:59:35 No I really wasn't messing around I just think it is indeed rather sideways and expect a bear market in crypto to be as aggressive as its bull markets are. But I think everyone's personal portfolio and the volatility therein can disguise trends others see
3508 2018-01-25 18:59:31 sadly..only us citizens..
3509 2018-01-25 18:59:25 If you know what is TA then you wont say what you have said. If TA is so accurate, everyone in this world would be rich.
3510 2018-01-25 18:59:16 @katyperry showing her followers her “crypto-nails” today. The best thing to happen on Twitter.

3518 2018-01-25 18:58:41 今日ぱぶじーめっちゃしたな
3519 2018-01-25 18:58:38 In my short crypto life nothing has ever lived up to the hype
3520 2018-01-25 18:58:35 When we got Segwit, Core devs abandoned their promise of 2MB in favor of developing the LN.

The 2x fork was then unsafe, lacking replay protection, etc.

2MB blocks would have killed the need for BCH, but also the LN.

Blockstream is in the business of selling side chains tho.
3521 2018-01-25 18:58:26 Keep in mind bcash can barely even hit Litecoin volume but says its Bitcoin.
3522 2018-01-25 18:58:23 Damn right 
3523 2018-01-25 18:58:22 Cryo > crypto
3524 2018-01-25 18:58:20 You too brother!!The Crypto community is here to beat Wall Street, and the global banking system!!
3525 2018-01-25 18:57:57 Yeah ..... Crypto is straight up effin over gamers. However if you wait a bit i think Nvidia is gonna be selling GPUs directly from their site for a relatively normalish price.
3526 2018-01-25 18:57:37 @RobinhoodApp Such exciting news about the Crypto! Quick question- can I transfer the current crypto currency I have to Robinhood?
3527 2018-01-25 18:57:35 Oh I don’t doubt it - but for now this is what it is. “ Only BTC and ETH will be available for trading when that rolls out to waves of users starting in California, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, and New Hampshire in February, though more will be added. “
3528 2018-01-25 18:57:33 #Crypto Advice of the Day:  It's easy to put blinders on and treat whatever #blockchain you've invested in like a religion.

3529 2018-01-25 18:57:30 Coin prize is down, everybody is still locked into lending - perfectly scammed everyone. Basically, the only ones who made serious cash are the owners of #sfi #sficoin #Crypto #scam

3532 2018-01-25 18:57:21 When will the first movie about crypto currency be released
3533 2018-01-25 18:57:17 Crypto means hidden. Cryptography means hidden writing. And there are other proper uses for the term crypto. But cryptocurrency is not one of them: not a hidden currency.
3534 2018-01-25 18:57:14 I used to think it was a crypto-currency cause people called it cloutcoin.. there goes my credibility haha
3535 2018-01-25 18:57:09 Your more cryptic than crypto Mr S.
3536 2018-01-25 18:57:09 Just make sure own physical gold & silver in safest way possible and indeed right crypto also in safest way possible ...
3537 2018-01-25 18:57:08 The logic is there, if in a crypto form. It belongs to the Frankfurt School, the neo-Marxists & Postmodernism.
3538 2018-01-25 18:56:58 shifty schiff's gold biz will be going down soon!!

3545 2018-01-25 18:56:11 I’ll see your reversible trouser bonds and raise you 25 carbon footprints ... greed fuelled would be an understatement about  crypto
3546 2018-01-25 18:56:04 Almost all coins use BTC’s base code. What’s your point?
3547 2018-01-25 18:56:01 Good riddance Coinbase.

3553 2018-01-25 18:55:34 Crypto is to finance as Etsy is to consumer goods.
3554 2018-01-25 18:55:25 2/ Here's what matters much more than hodlers: people using crypto for purchases, merchants accepting crypto, developers building infrastructure on top of this ecosystem, core developers, full-nodes, miners, evangelists, cryptographers, etc.
3555 2018-01-25 18:55:24 Would you like an interview with @rchain_coop too? @boxmining One of the most promising next generation blockchain projects out there : 40,000 tx/second per namespace
3556 2018-01-25 18:55:08 Never chucked in a cent into $TRX. It is a gamble not an investment. Potential is there but I don’t gamble on potential.
3557 2018-01-25 18:55:05 Too many bullish events happening in crypto now, everything is going to go crazy very soon 2018 will be an amazing year
3558 2018-01-25 18:55:05 can someone explain all the hate for @PeterLBrandt? The guy is simply a technical analyst sharing his insights. #crypto #btc #eth #ltc #dash #neo #xmr #etc #waves #nxt

3563 2018-01-25 18:54:39 ただ下を警戒し続けるのも大事なことです。こういう相場はどちらにも対応できる準備を整えておかないと
3564 2018-01-25 18:54:37 That’s not a rumor, it’s confirmed if you read Robinhoods blog. All those coins are coming within the next few months. BTC & ETH at first, but the rest soon after.
3565 2018-01-25 18:54:31 Silk Road was one of the most disrupting companies of the last decades and the no 1 use case for Bitcoin/crypto. It created huge value for people all over the world. Unfortunately it was shut down by criminals because they did not want the competition.

3566 2018-01-25 18:54:30 As a new person to Bitcoin and Crypos , Archie @BitcoinDisciple - I highly suggest you go and check out Blockchain Revolution by Tapscott and Tapscott , and also The Coin Chain: Explained by @Bitcoin_Bren .

3572 2018-01-25 18:54:05 You think so? I don't know Amazon gift cards are pretty common and I could see that as good reward. Either way $kin will be big, but yeah if #Amazon is involved this is game over.
3573 2018-01-25 18:54:03 The Dutch National Bank @DNB_NL and @phielkema refuse to use term #cryptocurrency" but invented: "We call it 𝘢 𝘤𝘳𝘺𝘱𝘵𝘰 as it is not a currency". Bypassing that crypto stands for cryptography, branch of #mathematics containing much more than the math of cryptocurrencies.
3574 2018-01-25 18:54:00 Alright the Discord is fully functional. $25 or 0.02 ETH (Monthly) for now and the month of February! Sleeper $Crypto and DANK ICO calls. DMs and my @ are open.

Adios, @coinbase! #Crypto #cryptocurrencies
3583 2018-01-25 18:53:13 If it’s Coinbase, free blunts for everyone
3584 2018-01-25 18:53:07 Miners get to change the rules through consensus. Segwit2x was a bait and switch by Core to get Segwit so that LN could go live, without giving people the actual 2MB blocks that would have been real congestion relief.

Miners only changed the rules when 2MB was promised too.
3585 2018-01-25 18:53:06 Neither
3586 2018-01-25 18:52:59 Eventually we'll be calling it the Crypto-Solar revolution; harnessing the power of the sun in realtime rather than extracting it's historical environmentally damaging stored value, unleashing abundance.
3587 2018-01-25 18:52:52 Every purchase I make these days I think "maybe I should just put this in #crypto"
3588 2018-01-25 18:52:49 Hepsinin havası soğuk
3589 2018-01-25 18:52:44 I would recommend getting in #ICX for a short little moon ride. now...
3590 2018-01-25 18:52:43 “Here’s how Robinhood Crypto works. You can transfer up to $1000 from your connected bank account (more if you have a Gold membership). For smaller traders, that could eliminate the annoying delays on other platforms that can make you miss a low price you want to buy up.”
3591 2018-01-25 18:52:42 Every “real” trader that has talked crap about #robinhoodapp as a trading platform will be downloading it to buy crypto...
3592 2018-01-25 18:52:38 I bet @katyperry is in a restaurant right now making a great joke about how her nail tips are hot crypto tips so she doesn't have to leave a tip.
3593 2018-01-25 18:52:30 They mention it in the article, but more like a potential future. Now that bitcoin compatibility is a rolled back project to them, I’m not sure they’ll run towards another crypto currency so quickly before it matures for real.
3594 2018-01-25 18:52:24 Do you think tomorrow's future will impact the crypto market or the usual FUD ?
3595 2018-01-25 18:52:21 I feel like this is a very US-centric view of a bubble. Similar to the DOT com, the dot com was based in the US. Crypto is global, and until we see normie on-ramps globally we are pretty safe.
3596 2018-01-25 18:52:19 0xae5f52d32d265a4d2413c113c5aeb3be9a3d5d21
3597 2018-01-25 18:52:14 Oh that's going to hurt! Once governments get into crypto-currencies the end is near. Now they can control their slaves the citizens better!
3598 2018-01-25 18:51:56 #rdd #reddcoin smells good again #cryptocurrency #crypto #altcoin #blockchain #hodl #bitcoin
3599 2018-01-25 18:51:56 Now @RobinhoodApp coming for @coinbase ... this is excellent for the market. Imagine being able to buy more crypto with usd, AND being able to cash out without converting to $btc. That's what this represents.
3600 2018-01-25 18:51:56 Looks like all the positive news for crypto was kept in the pockets till the market got a major correction. Its not a secret I was bullish in general for crypto 2018. My thoughts are getting stronger each day.
3601 2018-01-25 18:51:46 so is $XLM finally getting the love it deserves, or is this some more #FOMO happening right now? #stellar #xlm #FOMO #crypto
3602 2018-01-25 18:51:39 lol shh i'm trying to pump it so i can exit all crypto markets
3603 2018-01-25 18:51:28 the best crypto currency is runescape gold
3604 2018-01-25 18:51:11 At the end of a ski day over the weekend, this local guy jumped off his skis and started screaming at a tourist.

"You don't know how to F&%$ing ski! Get off my mountain!"

Very similar to old #Crypto people vs New crypto.

Let's start welcoming people with open arms.

3606 2018-01-25 18:50:56 I don’t pay attention to rumours - I believe those are the coins people will be able track through its platform though. That’s likely where that list originated.

3610 2018-01-25 18:50:41 I just downloaded @RobinhoodApp and I’m excited to be able to trade crypto assets alongside traditional markets all with no fees. Truly taking from the rich and spreading the wealth just as their name implies. Thanks guys!
3611 2018-01-25 18:50:38 No
3612 2018-01-25 18:50:31 When will this crypto treading water end ? ... Any day.... Any moment ...
3613 2018-01-25 18:50:31 Step 1: Short every public company with a recent name change that incorporated a buzzword from the #blockchain / #crypto space

Step 2: Long position on the 5-10 largest #cryptocurrencies

Step 3: $$$
3614 2018-01-25 18:50:25 Well said!
3615 2018-01-25 18:50:19 Did you build a Robinhood signup bot or something 
3616 2018-01-25 18:50:17 Seem there is a big fight between 0.001600-50. Good base but strong and wide resistance, but in the mid-long run I’m positive! Do you agree? Thanks for your great work!
3617 2018-01-25 18:50:02 Might see a small bounce but still looks bad
3618 2018-01-25 18:49:49 @cryptomanran  The time has come to change the tradition stocks values advertised on your show to CRYPTO
3619 2018-01-25 18:49:48 My crypto been a disappointment since the holidays

3622 2018-01-25 18:49:18 $Crypto is moving fast 

$lightning fast. 

Honestly having trouble tracking so many coins.

Reduced to ~30 

Each time I want to sell a coin ($xrp) I do some research & decide silly to sell.

Then! I find 2-3 more $shitcoins with real devs! 

All this while watching big picture

3624 2018-01-25 18:49:11 Different aspect of the business, not purchasing crypto. This service focuses on payments. The holy grail.
3625 2018-01-25 18:49:04 マジか！中級者40前後や思ったわ…
3626 2018-01-25 18:49:02 Any sort of disruption on a platform such as this is unacceptable.  Crypto adjusts greatly by the second.
3627 2018-01-25 18:49:01 Diversification across crypto is the only way to ride out these bear markets. Look at the blockchain your crypto is built on and make sure you don't expose yourself to multiple cryptos that are built on the same blockchain Eg: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hyperlegder etc.
3628 2018-01-25 18:49:00 Doesn’t matter where I live...crypto is global, like the sense of humor ;-)

3635 2018-01-25 18:47:51 Although crypto was not meant for governments to get involved
3636 2018-01-25 18:47:47 It’s not about *me*. I’m fighting for the good of the whole system. It’s the civilians I don’t want to see fucked, because if they get rekt by LN’s bad sellout design, that hurts all of crypto. I run a business on cryptocurrency. I really DO care about good technical solutions.
3637 2018-01-25 18:47:35 I think I understand. Maybe illustrating this on your site would be more efficient than explaining to individuals on social media. I still don't think "tuning" is comparable to crypto kitties' "breading" feature. As owning 2 ETHlambos doesn't give you a 3rd. Lack of functionality
3638 2018-01-25 18:47:31 The logical conclusion is that people will not be able to fund their payment channels 3 times a year when pay checks come every 2 weeks.

Regardless, supporting 7 billion people with that very conservative estimate requires 200MB blocks.
3639 2018-01-25 18:47:28 Crypto does not discriminate. We'll take anyone's money, famous or not.

3657 2018-01-25 18:46:08 Weirdly, I'm at least equally confident it won't be the "actual currency" either. For all the success and potential of crypto, Bitcoin is already terrible currency. And with the current technical limitations always will be terrible currency.
3658 2018-01-25 18:46:01 Why did u delete ur bullish tweet on crypto

3665 2018-01-25 18:45:16 Can we move money into crypto like coinbase or strictly crypto only exchange?
3666 2018-01-25 18:45:11 Nah I really need Beyonve to endorse crypto and really make some money
3667 2018-01-25 18:45:05 Ched goes XRP looking today? See any signs of growth ?
3668 2018-01-25 18:45:04 Core devs would not supoort it. The only ones that get a say on the consensus rules are miners. They voted over 95% for 2x and Core devs refused to support it.

Section 8 of the LN whitepaper says 1MB blocks will support ~35 million users with 3 on-chain transactions per year.
3669 2018-01-25 18:45:03 Crypto facebook not quite up to snuff

3671 2018-01-25 18:44:52 If you didn’t see bitconnect for what it was, get out of crypto
3672 2018-01-25 18:44:46 @RobinhoodApp Crypto announced. I’m gonna hop on board the blockchain train. 
3673 2018-01-25 18:44:40 Hold up let me buy some more crypto real quick .
3674 2018-01-25 18:44:27 Big for Stellar if those nails are real.
3675 2018-01-25 18:44:26 cmon bitcoin is everywhere since couple of months, how could he possible not notice? just making a story out of it for media
3676 2018-01-25 18:44:25 Hello @ShapeShift_io... do you ever plan on getting back to me or have you decided to keep my money? Three weeks of waiting for a response. My "support" ticket is #147725. I want a response, today! #Crypto #badcustomerservice
3677 2018-01-25 18:44:23 I agree. What I meant is crypto doesn't even seem have that going for it
3678 2018-01-25 18:44:19 Your best pick for a private coin as of today. #crypto #cryptocurrencies #cryptotrading #bitcoin
3679 2018-01-25 18:44:14 The Airdrop registration will start on 20.01.2018 at 9 AM UTC and  will end up on 27.01.2018 at 9AM UTC. The snapshot will be taken on  29.01.2018 at 12 PM UTC.We have allocated 1 million EXCC coins for the Airdrop. I completed my form today.
3680 2018-01-25 18:44:13 It shows you are trying but we want decentralisation, sort it out google and get on the blockchain
3681 2018-01-25 18:44:12 We should not fear some regulation if it helps to weed out the bad actors who hold back the crypto movement from going mainstream
3682 2018-01-25 18:44:03 Wait a minute, wasn’t @theNXTstudios also involved as one of the first music bought with crypto? #Nxt had so many pioneers and first use cases. Unfortunately the media kept ignoring it. 
3683 2018-01-25 18:43:57 Thanks for the response bro. As we can see the volitality of this coin i dont think it will last long. May be i am wrong please correct me. All i want to know is that the market cap of this coin is still highest and it is getting decreased new coins can surpass the cap
3684 2018-01-25 18:43:54 Lol smh man what in the fu**k is this tweet turned into who said they were bad ppl or they weren't smart rich or anything 
Ppl I just said how many ppl can really affoard a $ltc coin out of 1.3 billion ppl
3685 2018-01-25 18:43:47 More like crypto-gift-cards.
3686 2018-01-25 18:43:33 When is it being released on the Apple store?
3687 2018-01-25 18:43:30 Ahhh! Texas is safer, closer, and has better football. In fact, after we all get rich, every crypto owner in every state should chip in and buy Clif a vacation home in their state.
3688 2018-01-25 18:43:24 It will be interesting to see who can come up with an application for all of those mining ASICS. Maybe a post-crypto supercomputer? Either way I'll just be happy if I can get a reasonably priced new graphics card.

3692 2018-01-25 18:43:16 How stupid is crypto mining right now? I could sell my 1060 6GB on Craigslist today and make $130 profit.
3693 2018-01-25 18:43:12 If only 4 sale on ED, no way, ain't goin there ever again. Would rather miss a few bucks and wait for safety. Don't know who #IDEX is, shows they did 29% of recent sales.

3716 2018-01-25 18:41:23 Thanks for the update.  If they can find a way to add an automatic token detector that adds new tokens to the list whenever they are deposited  so the user wouldn't have to do it manually that would be HUGE for new crypto and ERC20 token users. (At least I think so)

3735 2018-01-25 18:39:49 "100,000 of Robinhood’s users were regularly seaching for crypto pricing and trading in its app, and 95% of those surveyed said they’d invest in cryptos if the product supported it."
3736 2018-01-25 18:39:48 When is the going to implementation of lightening to BCH.
BCH has lost investers supports to invests on BCH. There is requires more initiative to competes maket with growing ICO, to make more competitive compares to other crypto coins. More rewarding, more connectios with cryptos

3744 2018-01-25 18:39:26 Fun Fact: In England during Victorian times, automobiles when first invented were required to have a man walk infront of the vehicle at all times waving a red flag to alarm others that it was coming. 

This is what happens when you regulate before you understand the tech. #crypto

First of All. Recent bulltrap created a cryptowealth and  many recent ICOs have reached their hardcap due to this surge.
When an ICO reaches it's hardcap , usually it starts with x4 of İCO price in Exchanges.

3786 2018-01-25 18:35:44 Based on my research, Germany's economic rebirth post Weimar was primarily due to the issuance of debt free money by their government.  I don't see any reason why the USA can't do that.

3801 2018-01-25 18:34:40 Nice.  Wherever there are problems to be solved, there are tremendous opportunities for business, I love it.

I'm also focusing on solving some major problems and making everyone's life much much easier.  By helping as many people as I can, I know our efforts will be rewarded.
3802 2018-01-25 18:34:35 Robinhood is putting crypto’s on their platform for comissionless trading. This could be huge for Bitcoin
3803 2018-01-25 18:34:33 Don't miss out on this great investment opportunity

3804 2018-01-25 18:34:32 @justinsuntron a shout out to @Crypto_Escobart for always being first and supporting TRX would not hurt you one little bit buddy 
3805 2018-01-25 18:34:29 crypto directives from government seem a bit choppy at the moment but there sure is interest from public. This is quite exciting though. A major firm, Reliance also wants to head into crypto. So I guess this is as a good time as any to enter the market.
3806 2018-01-25 18:34:23 I saw the same post. I'm glad I found crypto twitter earlier
3807 2018-01-25 18:34:17 Cue the decentralized exchanges and privacy coins.  More up this crypto sleeve than a dirty arm. ;)

3830 2018-01-25 18:32:35 Taking a step to 2MB blocks would likely have removed all fees. Core won't do that though.

That seems kind of weird seeing as the LN whitepaper says it needs 140MB blocks as I'm sure you're aware.

Blockstream is in the business of selling side chains though so...

3842 2018-01-25 18:31:35 ok dude - didn't mean to be offensive :) 
if you keep doing your research you find out that ICOs are held in the www. Which means wherever you find I-connection you could technically participate in ICOs except.. some places like US and China.
3843 2018-01-25 18:31:34 Can we buy stocks with crypto?

3853 2018-01-25 18:30:41 Coinbase and other anointed exchanges are the controllers of the adoption rate and price controls of the transition. Decentralized fiat to crypto exchanges are the only weapon against this.

3855 2018-01-25 18:30:34 Chris, in the USA, we have a limited number of fiat to crypto connections that are insittutionalized. 

There's a oligopoly of companies that have the licenses and banking relationships to enable it. Some OTC desks too.

3968 2018-01-25 18:21:11 #Robinhood to start allowing crypto trading. Let's go, WE OUT HERE.
3969 2018-01-25 18:21:08 Sad I missed this tweet on Christmas lol, anyway I dunno if I can forgive Circle for abandoning us to begin with.

3971 2018-01-25 18:20:38 Rookie Question: I have to ask, I see it all the time. What’s the CORN? 
3972 2018-01-25 18:20:38 I wish it were @coinbase but my $ is on a UFO landing first before they realize that they are in the crypto business and need to add more coins.....Coin base my ass....need to change their name to "Only 4 Coins"
3973 2018-01-25 18:20:25 Dude you must be new to Crypto
3974 2018-01-25 18:20:19 Crypto Bhi you are so vocal about social issues ... itna bara scam samnay aya hai violent child pornography aur ap crypto crypto... say something on this issue
3975 2018-01-25 18:20:17 Used to be :

3977 2018-01-25 18:20:06 Pinche mercado de las crypto está aburridisimo, hace una semana que no pasa NADA.
3978 2018-01-25 18:19:48 Well what people dont understand also... is that the marketcap is growing. So 5 billion might be the "goal" to get into top 15.. but that will barely make it to the top 50 in the future because crypto is growing at a rapid speed.
3979 2018-01-25 18:19:46 Exchange onboard? Does not make any sense!!! Do they invest into Tron or they just list TRX!? Confused!
3980 2018-01-25 18:19:45 Lol what a bullshit article.
3981 2018-01-25 18:19:39 Can't wait until all the crypto bros become cannabis ETF bros

3984 2018-01-25 18:19:28 The CathalCoin ICO will be different. It'll be plain speaking Blockchain crypto AI hybrid tech. BCAHTEch if you will.
3985 2018-01-25 18:19:26 Indeed it is.
3986 2018-01-25 18:19:25 I struggle with the same thing, I want to spend a lot more time investing in crypto and compounding my games like before, but I'm thinking more longer-term now, and trying to focus hard on my project also.
3987 2018-01-25 18:19:18 Of course then you buy in and it drops 80% right after.
3988 2018-01-25 18:19:13 The scam accusation is on the bitcointalk xrg site. Anyway, can you explain four different monerogold projects? How should we trust any of these?
3989 2018-01-25 18:19:11 my best guess is Bittrex
3990 2018-01-25 18:19:10 Robinhood = Crypto currency coming soon

3992 2018-01-25 18:19:05 #coinflux @OlaJohansen10 @Crypto_GodX, maybe the day has finally come?
3993 2018-01-25 18:18:59 What did it start on etherdelta at, or what you think will start at tomorrow? Ain’t going to go steaming in, think better to see how first hour goes, could dump hard.
3994 2018-01-25 18:18:57 Check out Ethereum Cash! #Ecash  #Ethereumcash 14,100,000 In circulation. Rank 670 ECASH was created to offer opporunity and mass cryptocurrency adoption amongst average users. Ecash hit a high of 1.30 this year. Buy now at a low! #cryptocurrency #etn #btc #crypto #stocks
3995 2018-01-25 18:18:54 Yeah, when I can get him to move, he goes really fast and then acts surprised/upset when he bumps into stuff. Immediately sits down and freezes. He was crypto, so the poor thing has 3 incisions. I'm sure he's uncomfortable. :-(
3996 2018-01-25 18:18:53 @RobinhoodApp about to change the game. Zero-fee $crypto trading and tracking all on a mobile app. Coming in Feb. @coinbase best watch out 
3997 2018-01-25 18:18:37 Sorry, 10 million things to keep track of, what are you working on?
3998 2018-01-25 18:18:30 #Crypto markets are in their infancy. And infant markets reward information discovery with asymmetric payoffs. #DYOR
3999 2018-01-25 18:18:29 Im sceptical about these kinds of fights, any harsh regulation would be a foolish move any nation. You'd cripple your chances for crypto to prosper, it hands over power to others.
4000 2018-01-25 18:18:29 2018 Year Of The Ripple.
4001 2018-01-25 18:18:18 So @RobinhoodApp finally decided to join the crypto party ayy 
4002 2018-01-25 18:18:17 i went 50% in it when it was $3.5 and it has been falling ever since...
stuck with it for a long time i guess
4003 2018-01-25 18:18:10 @RobinhoodApp @AskRobinhood I assume trading crypto through your platform will work like other crypto exchanges, where we can transfer bitcoin into your app through an address or trasfer bitcoin out of your app to another address?
4004 2018-01-25 18:18:03 "dancing"
4005 2018-01-25 18:18:01 crypto generation trolling @PeterLBrandt is truly hilarious.
4006 2018-01-25 18:17:58 niggas will sit on the block and slang rocks but not put $10 into crypto
4007 2018-01-25 18:17:57 This just proves your an unemployed Bum... 
4008 2018-01-25 18:17:52 Hi all! Just got back from Bali, Indonesia with some family and friends. It was a nice and relaxing vacation, but now it’s back to business. Let’s talk crypto!
4009 2018-01-25 18:17:47 STKtoken. When hits exchanges it will go minimum 20x in next few months
4010 2018-01-25 18:17:47 Robinhood would be great.  They are opening a crypto side for trading next month!!!
Coinbase would be the best long term..
4011 2018-01-25 18:17:44 Not at all... that‘ll be fixed be by Lightning tho. Crypto is about decentralisation, developer contribution, lack of dictorial leadership.... xrp lacks all of these attributes. What do you think is the difference between xrp and paypal? What benefit in userexperience?
4012 2018-01-25 18:17:21 Coinbase
4013 2018-01-25 18:17:14 Robinhood Crypto App that is coming out

4018 2018-01-25 18:16:56 I agree 100%because I am invested in the market as well as 401K as well as crypto but that really didn't answer my question. I worry more about the people around me n the majority of the country that doesn't take the same steps we have... Idk it's not always about seeing green
4019 2018-01-25 18:16:50 @kucoincom ?
4020 2018-01-25 18:16:46 Well done, you must be very excited.

4024 2018-01-25 18:16:35 At the same time, gotta DYOR and learn from them rather than just follow the tips.
4025 2018-01-25 18:16:33 @katyperry LOVE THIS! $BTC $ETH $LTC do you own any Crypto? If so which ones? #Bitcoin #Ethereum #Litecoin @CNBC @FoxBusiness @business Yesterday it was @50cent today its @katyperry Looks like the Celebs LOVE CRYPTO
4026 2018-01-25 18:16:30 Which exchange is that?
4027 2018-01-25 18:16:26 Want to get into crypto but I have no idea where to start lool
4028 2018-01-25 18:16:24 Bittrex of course;) we wish
4029 2018-01-25 18:16:22 lol
4030 2018-01-25 18:16:20 @willjasen I once sold enough TF2 hats to buy a game on Steam. That means I'm into crypto right? :D
4031 2018-01-25 18:16:15 Wait! What???
Is that a WHITE GUY DANCING???
4032 2018-01-25 18:16:10 Damnit
4033 2018-01-25 18:16:10 I fail to understand the connection of the price being due to no regulation &, of course, certain politicians & media want us to believe the majority of investors are crooks. The rules of supply and demand are more relevant & manipulation is probably at the hands of the very rich
4034 2018-01-25 18:16:07 Tip: Just because someone has the word 'crypto' in their Twitter username. It doesn't mean they know what they're talking about!
4035 2018-01-25 18:16:05 @ByronBernstein did you invest in any crypto, if so whats your favourite?
4036 2018-01-25 18:16:05 Look like he gonna walk over and start talking to you about crypto currency
4037 2018-01-25 18:15:56 Maan wait until @Ethos_io drops! Coinbase is dead in the water.
4038 2018-01-25 18:15:55 Crypto is about to take yo profits

4043 2018-01-25 18:15:41 Yeah, there's definitely a lot more KYC than with some Crypto exchanges. They're regulated by FINRA & SEC. I'm more excited for stock traders & the /wallstreetbets crowd getting into crypto, than crypto people getting into stocks.
4044 2018-01-25 18:15:38 also play around with the testnet to understand the risks and learn the interface before you start doing it with real money!

4050 2018-01-25 18:14:53 yes
4051 2018-01-25 18:14:50 Crypto "CEOs" that can only be abusive to users would be better off leaving interacting with others to people who actually care.

On the other hand, it's often enlightening to see how little such people actually care about their users.
4052 2018-01-25 18:14:49 I'M WITH YOU THERE.  EVEN IN A SEA OF RED . WITH CRYPTO YOU WOULD BE FOOLISH NOT TO BE BULLISH.  THE ONLY WAY IS UP. 
4053 2018-01-25 18:14:45 Needless to say touchy about crypto after heeding so called experts and getting rid of Bitcoin amidst all the criminal news way back when. Now I follow my instinct. In case you care.

4057 2018-01-25 18:14:11 Robinhood adding crypto trading come February!!
4058 2018-01-25 18:13:55 It is  worthy. I love how these outside investors believe they know more than the crypto experts. They look like fools.
4059 2018-01-25 18:13:54 Lots of posts and excitement on this.  I went to sign up but they want your social security number?  I hope it's great for the space, but I'm in crypto for more freedom and privacy, not more matrix garbage.

4063 2018-01-25 18:13:41 Charlie you are spreading the fomo which you know is fake. Indian banks are regulated by RBI and it has issued directives to delink crypto accounts. Rather buy some LTC to restore confidence. Shame on you Charlie for such tweet!
4064 2018-01-25 18:13:30 Sir crypto currency is future of world. So please adopt the same and make it legal and impose & collect tax for trading of the same.

4065 2018-01-25 18:13:27 Would this also be cultural appropriation?
4066 2018-01-25 18:13:23 same when people bought btc at 19k. You can't grow 1000% without a correction afterwards. Most crypto newbies aren't traders, they don't really know when to enter the market. They'll be fine in the long run though.
4067 2018-01-25 18:12:58 crypto looks to me like a corrective few months ahead. lingering doom of regulation hanging over it all.

i have looked at the long-term chart for the combined mcap of all coins and it has a head and shoulder formation suggesting a reversal. interesting times ahead
4068 2018-01-25 18:12:51 Haha, I don't really care about the number of followers I have, I just thought it was funny.  Hey man, are you coming to Neo Devcon in San Francisco on the 30th?
4069 2018-01-25 18:12:51 Finally - those who sign up for February will be excluded from any rise in price. Personally I think $25 is very fair and very low. Especially if I make some dank returns for you all. I want to make you all some fat $crypto stacks. Hit my DMs and lets get to work!

4072 2018-01-25 18:12:28 But @Jamiedimon20 said he will fire anyone who would trade bitcoin from JP Morgan, so all the pretty JP Morgan girls didn’t go to crypto events :)
4073 2018-01-25 18:12:15 lets just look at the facts, this coin has steadily decreased in value over the past few weeks.  I know the whole crypto market is bad but $pac is over 50% down from when i bought it.  None of my other coins are down anywhere near that.  But you keep holding and believing
4074 2018-01-25 18:12:14 Gonna be doing a small crypto giveaway. What coin should I handout today? #Retweet #Crypto $TRX $CDN $BTC

4083 2018-01-25 18:11:33 I agree. Competition is a great thing.
4084 2018-01-25 18:11:24 Just the fact that you can trade crypto AND buy stocks in the same app is HUGE for the crypto space. Much improve. Such opportunity. Many Doge.

4086 2018-01-25 18:11:11 What kills us are fees from fiat to crypto.
4087 2018-01-25 18:11:04 No idea, but it goes to show how difficult it is to get state approval. People always wonder, why is no one competing against Coinbase? It's because it costs tens of millions to gain regulatory approval across the US

4102 2018-01-25 18:09:56 shameless brainless fools.
this is by no means money laundering.
black money stays black.
just changed its form from paper currency to crypto currency.
a person goes and buys gold in cash.
say worth 50000 each from 100 dealers.
is it money laundering.
NO.
4103 2018-01-25 18:09:55 In 2017, the #crypto market had one of the biggest bull run years that any market has ever seen. A "correction" was due and will only serve to stabilize overall long term growth of this market. Even if $BTC drops to $8.5k, it does so to serve long term stability and larger growth

4111 2018-01-25 18:09:43 And they're talking about it in wrong way, completely missing the point. Finally they'll come to the wrong conclusions meaning more efforts to regulate #crypto
4112 2018-01-25 18:09:40 Ppl either allocating Capital Bc they have no choice, In an ignorant Bliss, or waiting for the slow motion train wreck
4113 2018-01-25 18:09:39 How much of the crypto currency world is based of rumour and hype? There’s so many great cryptos that seem great in theory, but when you dive deeper there’s already a real world solution that’s cheaper and more efficient. Take storage for an example. #crypto #thetruth
4114 2018-01-25 18:09:26 No any crypto will move upwards until Feb , annonymous trading will be stopped, koreans will again start pouring money freshly with real names. All cryptos will starts flying.
4115 2018-01-25 18:09:13 Sounds so simple. 
4116 2018-01-25 18:08:53 bitcoin FXはロング(先に買い後で売る)で行う方が安全。多少高く買ってしまっても，待っていればもっと高く売れるのだから。逆に先に売ると，安く買い戻そうとしても相場がもうそのレベルに戻ってこない。大損する前に買い戻すこと。コインは減ったままだが，円での価値は取り戻せる。
4117 2018-01-25 18:08:48 1. A minority hard fork is appropriate to circumvent the power vacuum left in BTC development.

2. Read the LN whitepaper again or tell me how you know better than the actual LN devs.

3. Hard forks do not always result in chain splits. $XMR hard forks every 6 months on schedule.
4118 2018-01-25 18:08:48 Y'all know what it is!! I got in at less than a cent sooo... I'll give away 20k $TRX coins to random followers if (or when) TRON hits $0.50.

4120 2018-01-25 18:08:36 I agree with you that hodling is a weak strategy.I'm just saying that you are wasting your time trying to enlighten Hodlers.Capitulation is a place where most hodlers sell.Having a hodl moto will not change this in the crypto market cycle.Only then will make sense to them.
4121 2018-01-25 18:08:34 This said, there is a much cheaper $ZIL on EtherDelta but the contract address is wrong, so don't get scammed and buy this cheap version of the real $ZIL!
4122 2018-01-25 18:08:31 It’s prty shitty TBH
4123 2018-01-25 18:08:28 Is presale over?
4124 2018-01-25 18:08:25 I ramped the crypto rumour lol knew it was codshite but was a good laugh. Still sold at breakeven lol haha
4125 2018-01-25 18:08:13 There will be no clean break. Cryptography applied is crypto. Inseparable - joined at hip. Good luck with your mission.
4126 2018-01-25 18:08:13 @jason if you think Bitcoin sucks why are you retweeting @RobinhoodApp announcement about buying and selling Bitcoin and other crypto?
4127 2018-01-25 18:08:10 Soon

4135 2018-01-25 18:07:15 It's amazing how much you can learn from an NBA game when you bet on it, as opposed to when you have zero incentive to pay real attention. The same notion applies to the crypto space

4142 2018-01-25 18:06:59 Assuming #Bittrex lists $ETZ in the near future and also assuming you had $ETH in your account at the time of the fork, then yes. Whenever/if bittrex lists #ETZ, you should receive it in your wallet. #cryptocurrency #crypto
4143 2018-01-25 18:06:52 Done!! Good luck to one and all!!
4144 2018-01-25 18:06:49 Their website is one of the worst I've seen for crypto, so little content very vague. Even their GitHub repository is very small ... and that is pretty scary
4145 2018-01-25 18:06:43 Go do yourself a favor and download @brave I started using it and I’ll never look back
4146 2018-01-25 18:06:42 This is super exciting news! Bought my first stocks on the Robinhood App - sold all my stocks and moved into Crypto. I can't wait to purchase crypto with Robinhood. These guys get it
4147 2018-01-25 18:06:37 Awesome .. Thanks

4154 2018-01-25 18:06:01 U won’t believe but u can ;)
4155 2018-01-25 18:05:57 1. Contentious forks result in chain splits. A way around the max cap and easiest way to destroy viability of Bitcoin.
2. NOPE. Still wrong.
3. Which is why we need soft forks, not hard forks. You DON'T want a chain split.
4156 2018-01-25 18:05:55 @aelfblockchain One of the best crypto assets out there!

4159 2018-01-25 18:05:34 Robinhood's goal is to democratize access to financial services. Unfortunately, they are democratizing what their users want, but not what they need. On Robinhood u can:
1. day trade w/ leverage
2. And now crypto

They are casino posing as a sober provider of financial services

4184 2018-01-25 18:02:50 The markets for all crypto currencies are incredibly thin and are 1/100000 of what happens in the real currency markets. The last price paid only matters in a world that can get that price, anytime and at any volume. Cryptos don't pass that smell test yet.
4185 2018-01-25 18:02:49 I don’t know why people complain about there not being enough women interested in #crypto; since I showed up on various “who’s who” lists the number of pretty girls that want to be my Facebook friend has gone up infinite percent

4201 2018-01-25 18:01:01 Your name is gold bitches but you are calling crypto useless and a fail? This is comical to me. Keep buying your shiny little manipulated metal. I guarantee more people accept crypto than gold as payment for goods and services.

4212 2018-01-25 18:00:28 Very good point considering they are already monitoring every other aspect of our lives. Time we stand up as human race and resist tyranny wherever we can.  #Bitcoin being censorship resistance is a great tool  in restoring individual liberties.

4233 2018-01-25 17:58:45 なるほど。その人間を構成する物質は他の物に転用できるので価値が付くのは間違いないかと。BTCはほんと通貨としてしか使い道ないですからね。通貨として使えなくなっちゃったら無価値ですよね。まあLN次第ですね。
4234 2018-01-25 17:58:44 Yea sure smartass, the way they discribe it, the bank or any customer don't ever need to acquire or sell ripple. So Ripple s own stash of 60% can b used for the realtime conversions without ever touching a single outside coin

Banks would never risk a such volatile crypto neither

4237 2018-01-25 17:58:24 How bitcoin has changed. 
When people who claim to support crypto support a AXA controlled development team, complain that other coins shouldn't exist because of regulatory frameworks. 

You on the wrong side, bitcoin cash is saving bitcoin from the corporate takeover that is BTC

4244 2018-01-25 17:58:05 Yes. Coins rise without announcements. But Ripple has the biggest announcements in crypto and nothing. Although still hodling.

Also wrong about the asicboost. Segwit only blocks covert asicboost. Overt asicboost is still available on BTC Segwit
4256 2018-01-25 17:56:26 What I will do is take my investment out at some point prior to the fork, so that I get free money on free money.
Back when the $ZEN fork happened the price went down some time prior to the fork, let alone after the fork.
4257 2018-01-25 17:56:26 Interesting! How do you change your pool?
4258 2018-01-25 17:56:21 That is why it requires international effort. And the issue is not just this, there is also the discussion of free market economy. Why will a gov ban crypto-tokens that represent a value?
4259 2018-01-25 17:56:13 Sigh time to sell.
4260 2018-01-25 17:56:10 I'll take that comment from here than some "we need to look at banning it" blah blah FUD
4261 2018-01-25 17:56:04 Next on celeb crypto shills, @WillieNelson shills his $cann bag and dumps on noobs
4262 2018-01-25 17:55:50 All you whippersnappers abusing the abbreviation "crypto": it's short for "cryptozoology" you odious jackanapes.
4263 2018-01-25 17:55:45 You've always been bullish on $DRGN, but it keeps going down.  Curious on your thoughts as to why it will rebound?
4264 2018-01-25 17:55:44 I cant believe BitConnect is "NOT" dead.  Its up 50% today.  People in this market as soooo gullible...and that's not good for serious, professional, and mature professionals.  All these punks loosing their money..causes noise and distraction, limiting advancement of of crypto.
4265 2018-01-25 17:55:42 Last night somebody showed it drawn as a descending wedge but like you, I think it looks more like a channel than a wedge.
4266 2018-01-25 17:55:38 Stratis moon soon . $STRAT
4267 2018-01-25 17:55:36 Robinhood about to steal coinbase customers that have been looking for another reputable platform to buy crypto
4268 2018-01-25 17:55:32 Did you end up getting a loan?
4269 2018-01-25 17:55:30 1. Of course they mind contentious hard forks. It gives users more choice, and gives Core devs less control.

2. LN needs 140MB blocks. Where's the last 3 years of progress towards that?

3. Don't confuse a fork with a chain split.
4270 2018-01-25 17:55:29 The age-old mantra rings so true in $crypto: if it’s too good to be true, it probably is. But here, it probably is (a scam).
4271 2018-01-25 17:55:26 Never a dollar? Lol what a joke. DGB has the capacity to pass a dollar or 2
4272 2018-01-25 17:55:19 Do you even know what Market Cap is?

4276 2018-01-25 17:55:11 You think anticipation of fiat collapse is delusional? You should not be in crypto then.

4281 2018-01-25 17:54:53 Gotta learn bro. Slowly but surely you'll get better if you put in research, time, effort. It's a learning process, and a valuable lifelong lesson. Some ppl in crypto are using their exp from forex, dotcom, and penny stocks to dominate the rest of us plebs.

4288 2018-01-25 17:54:25 @CryptoKevyn Hi Kevyn, onwijs leuk om je te volgen over crypto’s. Je bent er lekker fanatiek nee bezig. Heb wel een vraag: waarom werk je met sats voor je voorspellingen? Sats zijn toch afhankelijk van BTC, en daarmee instabiel? Is het bedrag in dollars niet stabieler?
4289 2018-01-25 17:54:18 Well thanks Katy. The Crypto market will probably lose a couple hundred billion after this. If you can kill trap music by trying to do that, you can kill this market #Crypto

Should make it auto resize to fit the screen.

4299 2018-01-25 17:53:38 'Essential'...... Seriously? No it is not in any way essential. @verified just ignore it and carry on verifying others as normal. Plenty bigger, more accurate, quicker to the punch $crypto 'advisers' on here that would be ahead of him.

4309 2018-01-25 17:52:56 You're making this assumption because of a CNBC report about RobinHood trading? Once investment vehicle? Who says they won't add more coins as they realize the increased interest?  Not really an issue of me being honest or not, in my opinion.

4314 2018-01-25 17:52:40 The comments on that tweet are wild. Someone wants to hang them

4316 2018-01-25 17:52:33 El proyecto que respaldan es lo que hace la diferencia creo yo, pero igual, todas deben su precio a la demanda. Como todo en este mundo, pero aquí en las crypto lo vemos mucho más crudo
4317 2018-01-25 17:52:32 I can agree with that chart, I was looking at that scenario last night.
4318 2018-01-25 17:52:27 actually not bad...   best advice I've seen on mainstream media about crypto
4319 2018-01-25 17:52:25 Very few crypto assets today would meet that criteria.  Personal opinions such as yours on Bitcoin should be irrelevant for inclusion in an index today.  It is clearly the best asset to have in a broad crypto index today.

4324 2018-01-25 17:52:16 Internet crypto trading is growing dramatically and exposes the inherent and instinctive desire so many people have to trade. 

Crony-capitalism and other barriers-to-entry has kept too many talented people away from this basic instinct.

4326 2018-01-25 17:52:04 Today will be an interesting day in #crypto as the clock ticks for the #Bitcoin futures expire. Last time this occurred, we saw the price of Bitcoin plummet. As I mentioned before, I would not be surprised if we see Bitcoin price fall between $10,000-$10,500 at the end of the day
4327 2018-01-25 17:51:57 It looks like @dether_io has broken its own media barrier and is now gaining supporters quite quickly.

4367 2018-01-25 17:48:54 Its just the game, and fortunately in this market charts are historically recorded and we can visually see the game being played. Yes, that predictable and yes, that's how easy it is to make money in crypto.

4373 2018-01-25 17:48:26 If you say so. I can type up some symbols and screencap that too if you want a similarly convincing reply.

Regardless, if the system relies on centralized organizations to batch their transactions, then the system is fundamentally weak.
4374 2018-01-25 17:48:25 you put your name on the list and wait...  if you watched my video i explained how i got access.  did you sign up with crypto yet?  Robinhood just released crypto trading now.  they are making moves!

4403 2018-01-25 17:46:56 It didn't stop the Germans after the financial destruction of the Weimar Republic.  If anything, the motivated them to unite and fight.
4404 2018-01-25 17:46:51 Thanks for an unsolicited article!
The tweet was to address those who have "UK" in their profile & calling us "Poor"

Not to play a blame game here on twitter but they must have the balls to at least be apologetic of their actions in past or instead not to speak about us at all.
4405 2018-01-25 17:46:48 The $ELF waves are calming down, but damn were they fun! #crypto @aelfblockchain
4406 2018-01-25 17:46:41 Tomorrow is the big launch of @project_ecc new website! Can't wait to find out more about this mysterious partnership and finally know what Sapphire is! $ECC #ECC #Bitcoin #Crypto
4407 2018-01-25 17:46:38 RobinHood announces free crypto trading! This could be huge for $BTC and other #crypto. 50k signups in 10 minutes. Assume 150k people invest $1-10k each, $500M+ added crypto volume. Although that could just be a drop in the bucket, 24 hour volume is $28B, who knows.
4408 2018-01-25 17:46:38 Pes 2002 den beri oynayan biri olarak Fifa ya 2013 te geçtim. İyi ki geçmişim diyorum. Pes cidden çocuk oyunu. Yaş kemale erince( benim gibi ) Fifa daha gerçekçi oluyor. Ayrıca pro club özelliği ile arkadaş grubu olarak aynı takımda online lig ve kupalar da cok güzel oluyor.
4409 2018-01-25 17:46:33 Vinny's crypto game going skyrocket now he has there official grades!
4410 2018-01-25 17:46:21 Step your game up #ladies...get a #crypto wallet stop getting fooled.if some one is going to send you money dont trust  them trust the #confirmations
4411 2018-01-25 17:46:21 I had yeungling last summer in Florida. Too bad they don't sell it in Iowa though
4412 2018-01-25 17:46:19 There are middle-class noobs investing money they can’t afford to lose in crypto. People whose riskiest investment to date has been an individual Fortune 500 stock or a rental property.
4413 2018-01-25 17:46:18 I'm afraid "crypto means cryptography" is going to be the "actually it's GNU/Linux" of the 21st century
4414 2018-01-25 17:46:00 When selling?
4415 2018-01-25 17:45:57 My concession is that I think the future of crypto is not "one ring to rule them all" and that most likely crypto ecosystems will evolve to support different types of people and you'll essentially choose what "party" you want to transact on.
4416 2018-01-25 17:45:56 The crypto rumour was a blatant ramp by the usual group of rampers. That is fact. But it did give me the opportunity to get out. Trouble is any mention of crypto and sum ppl jump in. The rampers hv been pushing #more since the #ggp ramp but #more wasn't so easy to "sell"
4417 2018-01-25 17:45:51 Apparently they're not so urgent as putting obstacles in #crypto miners way.
4418 2018-01-25 17:45:44 Crypto is like a box of chocolates....lol
4419 2018-01-25 17:45:43 Once the coin goes live, you will use your email and they will send you another magic address that will allow for you to set a password and get your wallet.
4420 2018-01-25 17:45:43 As in anyone who pump and dumps to screw people for personal gain
4421 2018-01-25 17:45:38 Whales  will rip you off 
All in $ICX right now 
Still believe it will touch 20$ soon #Crypto
4422 2018-01-25 17:45:25 @RobinhoodApp is adding crypto! #bitcoin #etherium
4423 2018-01-25 17:45:25 I'm trying to download a safe & full functional wallet, but have read your posts about a faulty klk wallet from the last week. How do I go about downloading the new & improved wallet & also participate in the staking program??
4424 2018-01-25 17:45:20 Depends on volume, but I don’t think 1000 by February is out of the question
4425 2018-01-25 17:45:17 In many convos I’ve had it’s junk like this that is keeping a lot of people with money away from crypto
4426 2018-01-25 17:45:14 Sometimes people just want to be alternative to a fault, but I think the single biggest benefit to @crypto going mainstream is that yes, indeed, it is solid tech and quite possibly the future of currency. At the very least it might be recognized as a viable alternative to fiat.
4427 2018-01-25 17:45:12 ridiculous claims man. 100x lol. Yea maube for ico participants. We will see nice correction first before yoyr "100x"
4428 2018-01-25 17:45:04 Curious, what does your crypto portfolio look like then?
4429 2018-01-25 17:44:59 Losers ? As in who lol
4430 2018-01-25 17:44:53 I have beef with anyone who’s currently Crypto currency mining.. all i want is a damn graphics card for my computer so i can start this podcast. And you people have made it impossible to get one.
4431 2018-01-25 17:44:50 Thanks!
4432 2018-01-25 17:44:32 Bottomline: crypto is here to stay. Either you adopt or you fall behind. You choose. Said the same about vid, mobile when the "experts" were making $m with their now-proven off "predictions".
4433 2018-01-25 17:44:31 I think a lot of these losers need to be stopped
4434 2018-01-25 17:44:25 Excellent technology and concept. #globatalent, #crypto, #ICO, #cryptocurrency, #ethereum, #blockchain.
4435 2018-01-25 17:44:22 90% of crypto’s are very bad at marketing and actually slowing down potential growth.
4436 2018-01-25 17:44:21 I really hope all of crypto crashes so random idiots will stop asking me for investment advice.

I DON'T KNOW!

I don't care.

I need better shitposts.
4437 2018-01-25 17:44:21 Why trading Crypto makes sense:
1) Huge volatility
2) Relatively unsophisticated trading partners
3) Yolo

4441 2018-01-25 17:44:00 @AskRobinhood With Robinhood Crypto, will users be able to withdraw $BTC and $ETH?
4442 2018-01-25 17:43:58 Over 80k people have signed up on the Robinhood crypto waitlist in the last 90 minutes (tracking waitlist size in the app.) $crypto is def mainstream.

This will shorten cash flow of investors into #Crypto, lowering that market as well... but the public's frustration with traditional investing may also birth a regime change that favors #cryptocurrency market. #Bitcoin #XRP #ETH
4449 2018-01-25 17:43:30 The $crypto-left crapped on the suits as well for their "crumbs."

4454 2018-01-25 17:43:05 @DecentralizedTV Pita! Let’s hear about #robinhood adding crypto.
4455 2018-01-25 17:43:05 I can understand but crypto gains is all about holding
4456 2018-01-25 17:42:57 @CryptoChoe @RobinhoodApp is going to support crypto trading with 0% fees!
4457 2018-01-25 17:42:57 For over weeks your updates on altcoins and btc are totally wrong but i hope you are right now

4462 2018-01-25 17:42:46 Is this CFD trading or actually buying the underlying asset?

4464 2018-01-25 17:42:23 Everyone can like me who believe in #cryptocurrency
4465 2018-01-25 17:42:18 @DougPolkPoker what are your thoughts on crypto mining company stocks?  is this something you have looked at/invested in.  $hive and $kash for example...   big fan, keep up the good work
4466 2018-01-25 17:42:17 It's just a blockchain with sharding, yeah cool tech but no partners or any big projects lined up. Compare that to ICON for example and you'll see Zilliqa is way overpriced.
4467 2018-01-25 17:42:16 How imagine the future of crypto exchange: Onboard fiat via @TrustToken -> get fiat backed ERC-20 in my @LedgerHQ -> trade directly from hardware wallet via an @0xProject dex like @ParadexIO or @RadarRelay

4508 2018-01-25 17:39:37 The problem for ETH is that EOS, ADA, NEO, etc. exist. While currency-only coins also exist they will never displace BTC as the reserve currency of crypto. BTC will remain king in the long run.

4538 2018-01-25 17:38:06 #coinbase has 13 mil users. #Robinhood has 3 mil users and growing. 

Coinbase charges fees. 
Robinhood does not.

Robinhood will begin allowing crypto trading in February. 

Coinbase is about to lose a large chunk of its user base if it doesn't act quickly and incorporate #xrp
4539 2018-01-25 17:38:04 You cannot diversify something that is not driven by fundamentals. Diversification is to improve overall returns in the long-term due to network effects that are orthogonal b/w positions. In crypto, you may fall hard if you use that logic.

4557 2018-01-25 17:36:41 First they announced options and now crypto. They really want amateur investors to ride or die.
4558 2018-01-25 17:36:40 Robinhood is rolling out FREE crypto transactions for bitcoin and ether. Really, really cool. The coinbase fees are too high, unless they come down this is going to really affect them. #blockchain #robinhood #coinbase
4559 2018-01-25 17:36:39 Unfortunately for all us investors, @Crypto_Xchange  compaired to all other crypto exchanges are so completely unprofessional ,, BUT WITH THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY RECEIVED FROM US THEY SHOULD BE THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE,,LET US SELL YOUR TOKENS ON YOUR EXCHANGE

4593 2018-01-25 17:34:12 Done
4594 2018-01-25 17:34:12 It dropped more than 50% during the recent BTC/Crypto crash, from ~0.97 to 0.22, and bitusd survived, so it's a pretty stable decentralised Fiat pegged asset imo..

4647 2018-01-25 17:31:17 @RobinhoodApp what crypto exchange(s) will you guys be using?
4648 2018-01-25 17:31:09 Wisdom: the more negative you see/read/hear about crypto from otherwise techno journo/bloggers/experts, especially from SV, more weary you should be + do your own research.
4649 2018-01-25 17:31:03 How do you hedge
4650 2018-01-25 17:31:00 You might need a new bank. Or try a local credit union, or start moving into crypto/BTC.

4664 2018-01-25 17:30:21 @AskRobinhood @RobinhoodApp  great news! Will you start with your crypto exchange on February 1th? And will you also offer ripple/xrp from the beginning? Thank you!
4665 2018-01-25 17:30:19 今は大きい差はないかな。結局コアの致命的な欠点っていうのは、なにがなんでもスモールブロックでというのとHFをしない、の2点だろうから。ブロックを上げられると今のBCHは存在意義が薄れる。ただ、BCHは定期的なHFで通貨としての機能をアップしていくから、今後は機能に差が出てくると思うよ。
4666 2018-01-25 17:30:19 Establishing a Masternode is basically HODL-in on another level. You can still get 10x gains and are compensated for maintaining the network. Also chances of your coin losing value is drastically decreased because of node capabilities.

4672 2018-01-25 17:29:55 Yup, still holding and added. Once market correction stabalizes it will rise again. You only lose when you sale. All crypto is in its infancy, we are still the initial investors.

4685 2018-01-25 17:28:54 @ryanxcharles @vinarmani is there any kind of “cryptoshares” investment vehicle?  I think that’s another killer app, invest in a crypto company, earn dividends in crypto
4686 2018-01-25 17:28:52 I truly believe that you have no clue #bcash
4687 2018-01-25 17:28:50 Don’t stop now. You just decided to start when the whole crypto market was in the meat grinder. There are brighter days ahead.  If you’ve done the research and feel $IOST is a strong play, hold it.
4688 2018-01-25 17:28:45 And if your a real pro crypto trader, you've probably never seen any TT's
4689 2018-01-25 17:28:40 Even if there is another coin ready to take it's place, who would immediately trust another stable coin? How significantly have crypto prices have been artificially inflated by Tether? Nobody knows for sure. But it's failure will have a 10x greater negative effect, easily.

4702 2018-01-25 17:27:40 Check out iost... maybe add it to the list
4703 2018-01-25 17:27:39 If it was something like ww2 for example you can buy cod pints or earn crypto keys similar to cod points .. yes big youtubers are going to pay lots of money but me having spent nothing having 2 max prestige accounts with all the dlc weapons etc makes me feel like I earned it
4704 2018-01-25 17:27:35 me: this whole crypto currency thing seems kinda dumb...

the internet: this app pays you for the steps you take

also me: immediately signs up for 3 half marathons
4705 2018-01-25 17:27:29 Artificial intelligence is a great tool for our daily crypto needs. I like the idea of this project, people would regret if they haven't joined and supported it @daneelproject #AI #Daneel #ICO
4706 2018-01-25 17:27:04 Sort of but not really. Bitcoin is global. Multiple ISPs even domestically. Many more internationally. But at this point it sounds a lot like a govt targeting crypto users.
4707 2018-01-25 17:26:53 I don't know why exactly, but Katy Perry posting an image of her "crypto claws" makes me think market correction. Also, #BTC is the middle finger.
4708 2018-01-25 17:26:50 But at these exchange can you actually LTC with fiat currency ?
4709 2018-01-25 17:26:45 @Crypto__Market thanks for the #Follow, from all the guys @PyramidSoftware
4710 2018-01-25 17:26:43 so many opportunities all over crypto. better to invest in things you put the time and research in and are confident about. not because some "OG" said "airdrop" oh "free money". it is free money but not worth it if you get stuck with the tech part of it etc.
4711 2018-01-25 17:26:38 What's the timeframe to become a full fledged crypto store with wallets? That's the game change.

4737 2018-01-25 17:24:03 The problem is, it tether fails, BTC and all crypto will tank extremely fast. Most exchanges using tether will fail. You will have to be extremely fast to get your money out. It will take quite a while for the market to recover. It will kill people's confidence in crypto.
4738 2018-01-25 17:24:01 Actually, most of them don't mind a block increase. They do mind:
1. Contentious hard forks.
2. Unlimited Blocks or steadily increasing block sizes.
3. Constant drive to create new forks to increase block size.

4857 2018-01-25 17:14:02 Thank you I’ve bought in loads of stocks on rumours and lost money on them and i have never felt the need to put the blame on anyone - everyone talks their own book anyway i prefer to ignore the noise it’s been a good day on Vast and THR can’t win them all

4862 2018-01-25 17:13:25 Thanks for your response.  Can you explain the USD imploding?
4863 2018-01-25 17:13:21 Time to sell some crypto...
4864 2018-01-25 17:12:58 Thanks for your response.  Can you explain USD imploding?
4865 2018-01-25 17:12:55 Similar to fiat, which gets its ‘narrower’ function from its use in paying taxes. Only in crypto (for now, at least until a sovereign crypto is issued) its demand for token-mediated services.

4877 2018-01-25 17:11:51 One thing that often gets overlooked is just how fast the #crypto market moves. With everything slowing down right now take the time to formulate "your plan" over the next few months, research new/old projects, and to further development your intellectual investment in crypto.
4878 2018-01-25 17:11:48 How does this work?
4879 2018-01-25 17:11:37 Nietzsche: "...And when you stare into the abyss, beware, for the abyss will compel you to invest in crypto!"
4880 2018-01-25 17:11:35 I told them I was closing my account a while back because I was going 100% into crypto. Everything comes back around.

4885 2018-01-25 17:11:15 The hidden tranny army WILL appear and break down those sell walls. It's a sophisticated trap executed by Wallstreet. I anticipate for the blow-me-off top to be next week.
4886 2018-01-25 17:11:13 @TheCrypt0Mask unless you’ve already been there? It’s delicious.
4887 2018-01-25 17:11:11 The market drop came at a prefect time when all last year's ico's are coming out with there promises for Q1 don't back TA back who is keeping there promise it's fucking simple
4888 2018-01-25 17:10:56 what rebranding?

4891 2018-01-25 17:10:47 Hopefully robinhood can sell crypto the right way to put your sorry self out of business.
4892 2018-01-25 17:10:37 I only believe this is fair because I stay up super late on the nightly and I put in so so much time for this. Plus my partner would be more than inclined to swing me his dank $Crypto sleepers he finds with incentive. Hit my DMs! $25 USD. ETH is accepted.

4897 2018-01-25 17:10:29 This one was based off a 15m chart as a Day Trader Alert, yes. If you are unfamiliar, my day trader alerts are signals for the movement of a crypto in the next 30 minutes to 2 hours. However, you can do this with longer candles too if you want a multi-day projection
4898 2018-01-25 17:10:18 @DestroyIllusion "What is "money"? What is "value"? Both fiat currency, Gold,? and even Crypto have no "value" in the big picture.?"
Gold & silver were money back during the pharaohs rule of Egypt, ~ 5,000 years ago. Precious metals ALWAYS WIN do to excessive fiat printing.

4904 2018-01-25 17:10:08 Markets are frothy right now, lots of ppl getting excited about stocks, rentals, crypto, etc. Let me just say this... if you’re living above your means and have debt that is not aggressively being paid off, then you have zero business investing or speculating.
4905 2018-01-25 17:10:06 Building a great crypto currency portfolio by reading white papers and understanding the technology can be useful in identifying the big opportunities.

4912 2018-01-25 17:09:35 So looking at ETC, you wouldnt have sold yet because while the RSI was 70+, it didnt have a following retest and a breaking of the low that signals a sell?
4913 2018-01-25 17:09:34 To be fair to the kid, it seems he manages to put his clothes on every day. For most crypto "enthousiasts" anno 2018, this is not a simple task.

4938 2018-01-25 17:06:48 Yeah damn us people in crypto space who think that things like "market supply," "demand," and "price" mean "things". 

I know that this is not a security, but when you talk about a 10 TRILLION dollar cap, I just don't think you understand the industry.
4939 2018-01-25 17:06:26 Crypto is cryptography not cryptocurrency. Please  have some respect for the science of Cryptography by not using crypto as a term for cryptocurrency.

4945 2018-01-25 17:06:14 It's going to be interesting to see how they deal with transfering out crypto. The no fees thing is dope, but @COBINHOOD is doing the same thing (pretty sure they stole the idea and name from Robinhood). Whichever one of these guys put @lightning into their system will win.

4952 2018-01-25 17:05:45 Regularly check relative values in your crypto portfolio. If one coin drops a lot, or one increases a lot, exchange some of the highest valued one for the lowest. Buy low, sell high. DO NOT BUY MORE OF THE ONE INCREASING IN VALUE.

4957 2018-01-25 17:04:51 Why do I get the feeling that this Bitcoin and crypto currency is just one giant bubble which will eventually burst? Get in on it? Get out of it? Or just sit and watch as the tears flow from people that lose everything by taking the gamble...

4996 2018-01-25 17:01:21 What about private coaching? Do it do that? Where are you located?
4997 2018-01-25 17:01:14 Learning in Crypto and about markets provides endless streams of info for those that love to observe.

Being an observer by nature this is like putting a cat in a window with a bunch of bird feeders... which lil birdy (coin) can I come up on??

5001 2018-01-25 17:00:59 This is a very exciting launch for the crypto space. Finally a reason to re-open robinhood and to set up gold again.

5004 2018-01-25 17:00:45 People literally do not understand the crypto mania in south Korea. 1/3rd of all employed citizens have crypto. People get paid salaries in crypto. It’s huge there. Side note: just another reason why I’m bullish af on ICX. When OKcoin launches in KR with it in 2.5 weeks 
5005 2018-01-25 17:00:37 As much as I would love you to be right,question for me is how much #VEN will be impacted by the overall market cycle if it proves to turn bearish. Didn’t get in so early like you guys so people selling now might (partially)be the smart ones taking mini profits to buy lower?
5006 2018-01-25 17:00:34 The hard thing is regulating it without legitimizing it. Bonds and stocks are legal contracts and if you apply the existing suite of regulations to crypto are you also saying crypto has legal standing?

5021 2018-01-25 16:59:24 I believe 90% of Bitcoin investors didn't join til after 2016 mass majority joined in 2017. Since everyone think opinion holds power of course everyone will disagree.

5031 2018-01-25 16:58:56 ICX remains the same. Bullish ascending triangle pattern continues. 8200 range signals attention. A clear break above 8686 will confirm uptrend. Target remains same roughly 11K sat.
5032 2018-01-25 16:58:55 @PeterLBrandt Could you do an analysis on $XRP
5033 2018-01-25 16:58:43 People are going to overlook the #Robinhood news, but thats how most, if not all millenials (my age) got into investing. Coinbase is obviously big for crypto now, but Robinhood allowing you to buy and sell other alts is huge. Shifting some more money into $OMG off this news

5109 2018-01-25 16:53:29 I disagree. The blockchain is open source and can not be manipulated.
Also there probably will be many crypto currencies - not just Bitcoin.

The currency that is 100% NWO is today's fiat.
We MUST abandon the fiat currency and the fractional reserve system.

5124 2018-01-25 16:52:47 No one cares, and @SimplexCC doesn't really take any risk. You block way too many legitimate buyers using your simplistic and flawed fraud algorithm.

5126 2018-01-25 16:52:39 They'll come around. Took me some time. Crypto needs some rigorous methods for incorporating consensus protocols into its S curve analysis - an almost entirely new variable and one that feels like it will be significant.

5165 2018-01-25 16:50:45 @crypto_bobby Do you have a favorite portfolio tracking platform? Possibly one that is reasonably priced and allows API importing. Also, noticing most are desktop/website or mobile app, but not both. The latter is preferred. Thanks in advance for any insight you can provide.
5166 2018-01-25 16:50:44 Great job! Have you noticed that many crypto chartists don't understand or chart divs correctly? Nice to see you know what you are doing. :)

5175 2018-01-25 16:50:14 i can’t believe i’ve resisted the cryptocurrency stuff for this long (and still have no intention on participating).

5182 2018-01-25 16:50:05 @RobinhoodApp already markets its free-commission trades, which appeals mainly to low income young adults, or primarily the millennial generation. A platform for crypto mining offered will explode on Robin Hood where many millenials are already all signed up on this app. Genius.
5183 2018-01-25 16:49:54 I doubt you get your own keys. No way I'm putting money into crypto when I don't actually ever own the crypto.
5184 2018-01-25 16:49:52 It's so crazy I told my friend the same shit lol
5185 2018-01-25 16:49:41 I love Robinhood and will be using it for crypto, but Cobinhood has SophiaTX $SPHTX

5191 2018-01-25 16:49:16 you're forgetting that kids (<18) will be the ones to dominate crypto, and they're still on the sidelines

5204 2018-01-25 16:48:20 It's because all their fiat is in crypto

5207 2018-01-25 16:48:07 Crypto bubble hasn't started. Once we get brokerages/etrade/robinhood leverage trading shitcoins, that's when the top will be.

Until then, just fucking hold.
5208 2018-01-25 16:48:07 So if $BTC was created after the financial collapse then what will happen to its price if we collapse again? Oh sorry “when” we crash again?

5221 2018-01-25 16:47:18 >> Replacing bank ledgers and passwords by the blockchain and crypto keys did not solve the problem of theft by hacking.  Hackers learned to steal crypto keys, and used the tech to steal in new ways -- like ransomware and doctored hardware wallets.
5222 2018-01-25 16:47:10 Feels like a mechanism to introduce crypto to consumers more than anything else right now

5225 2018-01-25 16:47:01 yeah totally agree man. I was actually thinking about investing in IOTA but changed my mind after seeing how they handled the situation.. and how they basically treated rolling their own crypto as no big deal.. lmao

5236 2018-01-25 16:46:20 You do realize the market cap was only 198billion when I made this statement and Ripple hadn't had it's run up, yet, right? 

I eat, sleep & breathe crypto and have for WELL OVER five years, and have been here since 2010.
5237 2018-01-25 16:46:18 Perhaps.  It seems like payment processors like @BitPay might be subject to regulation, but if business accept crypto directly, without a processor, then current regulation can't really do anything about it.

5241 2018-01-25 16:45:42 The problem I see with Ripple is that 60% of XRP are owned by Ripple, which means they could dump it any time they want.
5242 2018-01-25 16:45:42 Bet you it would work flawless if you were buying more btc.  Is that what the crypto algorithms are all about? instant buy, time delay on the sell side.

5301 2018-01-25 16:42:17 You have a good point regarding the longest PoW chain; however miners follow profit. Over 90% of hash power signalled NYA support. Humans are creatures of habit. Therefore, price of BTC being high post fork is expected due to habit, not necessarily active choice.

5305 2018-01-25 16:42:04 Just saw this. Working on crypto stuff now. Will show you what I got so you can tell me if it works for your peeps in any capacity.

5310 2018-01-25 16:41:34 @jonfortt good morning, always enjoy listening to you and your thoughts. You sir are clearly well above the crowd in your knowledge of technology. However, some of your guests seem really out to lunch when it comes to crypto currencies and other technologies that you speak about
5311 2018-01-25 16:41:32 @tradingaddicts Jeff! I've missed your insights much since the iBC departure. You were playing for a stronger USD a few months back, I assume that thinking has changed. Public sentiment around metals seems disinterested at best with the crypto craze
5312 2018-01-25 16:41:31 haha nice

It's a HUGE paradigm shift, so there'll surely be a lot of ups and downs, no doubt. #nobubble

5341 2018-01-25 16:39:22 Expected to have a positive price impact, but may not. The one thing that's certain in crypto is uncertainty. I believe the market is cool in part due to Christmas spending recovery. Ask 100 people, get 100 different answers. The solution? Hold.

5348 2018-01-25 16:39:05 24hr NeverStop crypto markets have collapsed participants' expectation (time) horizons to an absurd degree. Price cycles occur extremely fast.

It's important to keep those expectations in a proper domain. Quality builds and rollouts still take man-hours, which are still limited.
5349 2018-01-25 16:39:03 @Sweatcoin Who’s interested in joining a class-action against @Sweatcoin for false-advertising?

5381 2018-01-25 16:37:19 Very good question..i think the reason why bitcoin is going to stay relevant despite it being slow and costly, is Bitcoin is a great store of value, its equivalent to digital gold, and i do think in the future bitcoin will be used purely as a store of value.
5382 2018-01-25 16:37:13 But behind the crypto is fiat on her nails...

5389 2018-01-25 16:36:44 ですです笑
5390 2018-01-25 16:36:39 Thanks bud
5391 2018-01-25 16:36:31 Thanks. Wow that's a huge %. In a way I'm glad it's not regulated meaning wasnt crypto $$ started due 2 wall street wreck of 07/08? I'm sure that's bound 2 change as they want a piece of the pie. Thanks for the response!
5392 2018-01-25 16:36:23 If you're dealing with USD, you need strict KYC.. Robinhood is a billion dollar startup, I have an account with them for stocks, never had a problem

5398 2018-01-25 16:35:45 Recommend this crypto !!! @aelfblockchain
5399 2018-01-25 16:35:42 You think you’re late to the bitcoin party, yet @RobinhoodApp one of the most popular trading apps, are just now talking about adding a crypto exchange. You’re not late to the party, you’re late to the pregame
5400 2018-01-25 16:35:41 Common...Thing that matters is that Zebpay is most widely used Crypto App in India..all noobs use Zebpay..so LTC price is going to increase and it increased after listing today only as compared to ite usd price.
5401 2018-01-25 16:35:31 I do push crypto. But that LinkedIn post was the inspiration for this tweet
5402 2018-01-25 16:35:29 I've got one password I'll give out if I ever get robbed. That has such a small amount. Plus, never use your name on social media and talk about crypto. It's not smart, someone out there will want your wealth.
5403 2018-01-25 16:35:28 cant pay for membership with crypto???
5404 2018-01-25 16:35:27 Agreed! With Ethos coming hopefully this quarter, with plans for fiat gateway afterwards as well.  Should be lots of options
5405 2018-01-25 16:35:23 I only use $DOGE
5406 2018-01-25 16:35:22 ok yes unfortunately lots of herd mentality in crypto :(
5407 2018-01-25 16:35:15 観察ノーポジですねｗ
5408 2018-01-25 16:35:14 Yeah exactly, trading a car for a car is a taxable event, and you can't pay taxes in cars. Point remains that taxing crypto to crypto transactions is a administrability nightmare
5409 2018-01-25 16:34:59 I'm usually working at this time of the day so it'll be nice to watch the market today! I'm getting too old to be a "hard working man." Rather sit home and watch my crypto climb!  One day!

5412 2018-01-25 16:34:49 Bitcoin dipping heading into cme futures expiration tomorrow. People expecting them to slam it down right ard 3/4 pm tomorrow to only see it pop back up big after expiration. It’s called banging the close.They did it last month. We will see. Could be great buying opportunity imo
5413 2018-01-25 16:34:48 I feel loved
5414 2018-01-25 16:34:42 Very excited for this, and to see what other crypto they add.
5415 2018-01-25 16:34:34 This is your regular reminder that if you put out an RFP for magic beans with an unlimited budget, someone will sell you magic beans, but that doesn't mean they'll work. See also: DRM, backdoored "secure" crypto, "de-identified" data sets, terrorism detection algorithms, &c

5418 2018-01-25 16:34:19 The ticker for Ethereum / Ether is $ETH ... that’s borderline negligence. Maybe you should rethink providing crypto insight if you can’t even get ticker symbols right. That’s pretty embarrassing...
5419 2018-01-25 16:34:07 Seems they have strict KYC. I know it's required in the U.S. but can the system be trusted with your personal info like SSN?
5420 2018-01-25 16:34:07 I highly recommend to take a look at @LiveCoinWatch. A really nice alternative to @CoinMarketCap where you can make your own personal watchlist and a lot more. #LiveCoinWatch #Cryptocurrency #Crypto #Blockchain #Alts #Bitcoin #Ethereum #dragonchain $BTC $ETH $DRGN $SUB $XRP $LTC
5421 2018-01-25 16:34:01 I think I get what you’re trying to do and I’m trying not to be a hater. But the crypto kitties run on a blockchain and offer breeding and continuous use after purchase. Does the ether lambo just sit in my virtual garage or is there some sort of functionality?
5422 2018-01-25 16:33:56 Go RobinHood. This is the best crypto news all year. I will cheer this one on cc @chrismaddern & @mdudas are you happy I am bullish on something crypto finally.

5424 2018-01-25 16:33:41 In my opinion, Geraldo Rivera is a crypto racist-Immigration is code & the spearhead of a race war to not only in Obama's words, "transform America" but consign white Americans to reviled minority status in the Nation Founded by our forefathers. It's Over! Ditto that Heraldo crap

5431 2018-01-25 16:33:05 Robinhood announcement is huge for crypto:
1. Competition for Coinbase. As Robinhood releases new coins, puts pressure on Coinbase to do the same. 
2. Millennials will see little difference between public equities & crypto.
3. New audience will be addicted to the crypto drug.
5432 2018-01-25 16:32:57 $1,500 is the minimum for both at this pre-ICO stage. If you're trying to send exactly that amount in crypto, we appreciate it might land on either side of the minimum which is okay. Apologies for the confusion for wording and thanks for clarifying - make sense now?
5433 2018-01-25 16:32:53 35点
5434 2018-01-25 16:32:52 It is very good if there personal multi coin coin wallet like COIN BASE is accepting INR. Really it will makes boom in cryptocurrency in India. 
Or any big corporate house plan to launch its own crypto . 
I am hearing about JIO coin.
5435 2018-01-25 16:32:51 so who's the FDIC of #crypto?????? where's the #bitcoin CFPB?
5436 2018-01-25 16:32:50 Why not the entire market cap? Should always adjust to the new favorite coins and represents as a whole how much money goes into crypto. If you can beat that, great.

Such a dumb decision.

5440 2018-01-25 16:32:41 Britain is decentralising itself away from a centralised Europe. Britain needs to embrace crypto and decentralised networks. After all at its core, is an immutable decentralised ledger that cannot be changed. Saying crime uses this is an easy label on a misunderstood technology

5446 2018-01-25 16:32:10 One that I find very interesting is @BulwarkCoin in terms of rewards distribution. Current MN returns is 25%, with 75% going to miners per block, but this will move to 33%/66% in Feb and 50/50% split in March. Next year, they'll transition to PoS with a see-saw model.
5447 2018-01-25 16:32:00 If you're interested in finding "gems" on Cryptopia, consider a micro-cap masternode. Some of the ones with market caps around 20-40 mill and less can net you 200-500%+ annual ROI based on current share prices.
5448 2018-01-25 16:31:57 To your point, we can't use it for that NOW, but there was a time we couldn't use credit cards or electronic transfers for that either.  Crypto will become the norm eventually.
5449 2018-01-25 16:31:51 Hey Katy, welcome to the wonderful world of Crypto 
5450 2018-01-25 16:31:49 Kate did you almost hed this "FBI Director Back(door) on His Bullshit"
5451 2018-01-25 16:31:26 RT! -> Plutus Tap & Pay for Android covered in EasyJet in-flight magazine! We're now reaching a growing audience interested in crypto and informing them about our convenient way to go shopping with Bitcoin & Ethereum. And any time you shop, you also earn up …
5452 2018-01-25 16:31:20 XVG is a shit coin. Get with it guys. The coin is slowly dropping in the ranks
5453 2018-01-25 16:31:14 Well that could drastically change once crypto gets added. Definitely going to see an influx of new users/support issues. Don’t know if they are equipped to handle that much volume!
5454 2018-01-25 16:31:10 Once you see a crypto currency near 0% micro mine everything attached to it for Nano coins until they tell you it’s stable.  Except ethereum.  Fees.
5455 2018-01-25 16:31:09 Betting it is one of the crypto  clowns you called out....
5456 2018-01-25 16:31:08 The error w/ “(crypto)currency” is to think about it as a thing, whereas “currency” is better viewed IMO as a quality or condition (like the term "fluency") of value being able to route between two points. In each route/flow, 1..n assets/ledgers, crypto or not, may be used.
5457 2018-01-25 16:31:06 @mdudas you seem to be the only person on my TL who sees Robinhood crypto trading as bad for consumers. Could you expound on why this is bad for crypt newcomers?
5458 2018-01-25 16:31:02 Canada wants to regulate cryptocurrency because the finance minister sees a new revenue stream. His interest rate hike is not warranted and needs support for the argument. The entire mandate of Crypto is decentralization. @GlobalEdmonton @BNN
5459 2018-01-25 16:30:58 Any suggestions on any cheap USB miners or good sources to learn about mining. The concept always intrigued me but always seemed so daunting
5460 2018-01-25 16:30:56 I like to know what I'm talking about before I talk about it.

5462 2018-01-25 16:30:44 The #crypto buy-rush/hype is over.

5492 2018-01-25 16:28:31 Awesome @RobinhoodApp starting crypto support.. BUT, when something is "zero trading fees", you'll pay for it elsewhere (spread, withdrawal fees, etc).. more competition for Coinbase and ultimately another onramp is

5504 2018-01-25 16:27:46 Marketcap is misunderstood. It doesn't mean that much in crypto TBH. Supply and demand are what counts. If buyers > sellers price can go up regardless of Marketcap
5505 2018-01-25 16:27:40 Britain is decentralising itself away from a centralised Europe. Britain needs to embrace crypto and decentralised networks
5506 2018-01-25 16:27:39 If you do the research you’ll see that the #XRP team is moving towards decentralization this year.   Also, grow up with the whole “stands against crypto comment” this is about using technology to change the world  #xrpthestandard
5507 2018-01-25 16:27:37 They just wanted to get a piece of the action.  I'm sure they now understand the level of interest in the crypto market.  In the long run, visibility is a good thing as the market matures.
5508 2018-01-25 16:27:37 I’ve got a tame crypto newb I’ve been helping navigate the space.

I’m trying to help him grasp only what he needs to at each step along the way, with no extra fat. Accelerated learning, of sorts.

Mind blown by how fast he’s progressing.
5509 2018-01-25 16:27:36 it's different because if you run out of fiat, that means you have to dip into your crypto and.... well fuck that
5510 2018-01-25 16:27:36 It's very frustrating, but it's just a setback. We will find new relationships with banks who understand that crypto is the future of finance.

5546 2018-01-25 16:24:43 @JayzTwoCents 
Hey Jay, what so you think of the idea of cards being made specifically for crypto currency? Do you think that if a new company came along and did this that it would take pressure off gaming cards and cause the price of those cards to go down?
5547 2018-01-25 16:24:40 The time of this metaphorical boat you speak about is never published. 
I'm guessing we must wait till it comes. I understand now.
5548 2018-01-25 16:24:38 I was just talking about this with @CryptoMonkey0. The amount of infrastructure that exists around bitcoin and crypto in general makes it much less likely to plummet to zero now. Think of all the hardware mines, users, hodlers, futures market, apps, websites, etc,.
5549 2018-01-25 16:24:35 I have four different fiat currencies and 4 different crypto currencies on me right now. Me likey.
5550 2018-01-25 16:24:30 I think they are one or your investments correct?  If so, I have a couple ideas that I think would really help them standout in the crypto trading world. Would like to share them with you, if your open to it.

5592 2018-01-25 16:20:52 We'd love to educate students & volunteers on some of the memory-hard crypto technologies. If somebody can give an intro to @lisasu or others at @amd regarding getting some graphics cards to move that part of development forward it'd be much appreciated!

5595 2018-01-25 16:20:40 100% agree. @DigiByteCoin is based of Bitcoin core with a gradual increase of block size @jgarzik was right about increasing the blocksize to match atleast visa while @gavinandresen solution was implemented on DGB to increase at certain block height. It’s all available on Github
5596 2018-01-25 16:20:39 Everyone in crypto knows time scales don’t work! What’s the point of being given a timescale which then isn’t met and then cause a load more FUD. They are working on it, just wait and stop adding to the price drop!
5597 2018-01-25 16:20:37 No he doesn't know yet. Shhhhh!
5598 2018-01-25 16:20:33 I'm a fan myself, but when crypto gained popularity partly as a result of unlimited fiat printing that concept might turn people off. Just pointing out why it may be under the radar still

5608 2018-01-25 16:19:49 @RLewisReports do you believe all crypto to be a bubble or just bitcoin?
5609 2018-01-25 16:19:46 I'm a huge fan of $DCR. (200K is more like a 20X)

banks, endowment funds, billionaire family offices, sovereign wealth funds, etc coming into crypto as a new asset class are going to enter into Bitcoin for store of value.

They are not going to buy an altcoin hoping for a 200X.
5610 2018-01-25 16:19:31 Is there a crypto/ICO project out there geared toward civic engagement?

5736 2018-01-25 16:08:35 We want to be able to be digital nomads and live anywhere in the world.  Crypto moves so fast, compared to that, stocks will be easy
5737 2018-01-25 16:08:34 I'm in, as long as its not a scheme or pump and dump
5738 2018-01-25 16:08:32 I'm less concerned about whether we're going into a bull or bear market and more concerned about knowing what to do in each situation.
5739 2018-01-25 16:08:21 The only way fees are going down right now is if less people are using the system. Nothing has been done to increase the throughput.

5743 2018-01-25 16:08:12 When did you make this call?
5744 2018-01-25 16:08:10 I already reported this issue few months ago via telegram, app store and I also have sent all the details directly to you by dm but I was ignored. 

Despite that I didn't complain until recent ban for pointing out your lack of professionalism in this matter.

5746 2018-01-25 16:08:02 I started in crypto investing back in July and I really like it.  I'm teaching myself TA fundamentals from YouTube, and I want to expand into stocks, commodities etc
5747 2018-01-25 16:08:01 As crypto is a money laundering sceme, I see the ban a reasonable.
5748 2018-01-25 16:07:59 Why if I may ask

5759 2018-01-25 16:07:05 You sound like I did when I REALLY wanted $2400 btc on the 5K correction. 3K would likely kick off a bear market with long term implications and possibly just kill crypto altogether depending on how many people realized 95%+ losses.

5761 2018-01-25 16:06:36 In that situation there wouldn’t be value. With more hashing power there would be more possibility to use more tokens per transaction to disperse the data being stored.
This would help the network, allowing Bitmain miners.

5769 2018-01-25 16:05:59 Correct. Banks are not required to use XRP, but are heavily incentivized to do so.  This will lead to XRP adoption.

5773 2018-01-25 16:05:41 It seems crypto has become very stable over the past few days with no major breakouts. Watching the trade data on binance live there a spikes that are quickly put under control again. Is crypto being regulated by whales????

5824 2018-01-25 16:01:51 (Who in their right mind listens to May?) More seriously, this is a great message you're sharing, one that applies to not only crypto but all the things that politicians attack with fear-mongering. Knowledge above all!
5825 2018-01-25 16:01:45 Anything w that many commercials can’t be good.
5826 2018-01-25 16:01:45 Ignorance at its best! The US dollar is the #1 currency used for illicit activity but know one is suggesting we shut it down. Crypto can't be stopped. Any political moves are short term measures to slow it down. Decentralization is the future.

5871 2018-01-25 15:58:59 I like you crypto ;)
5872 2018-01-25 15:58:54 I respectfully disagree, I've had numerous people message me who got into crypto over the last 3-4 months asking how to run a Bitcoin node.
5873 2018-01-25 15:58:32 Any other coin you know ever stay in limbo for an entire year with no gains or is 2018 the start of your crypto experience?
5874 2018-01-25 15:58:31 ビットバンクの操作がなんかよくわかんないし、かといってコインチェックに入ってるXRPは350円〜325円で買った物だから今のレート142円であのXRPをADA買うのに使いたくないって人に話したら
どうせリップル上がるからグダグダ言わないで ってめっちゃ怒られた
5875 2018-01-25 15:58:30 What exactly are you claiming to do here @HarvestMnCoin ?  Harvest wallet to hold multiple currencies?
5876 2018-01-25 15:58:27 I invest in stratis because its own value, although the team disappoited me many times for not keep their promises on time, Im still have faith in this project. So stop shilling like that, it makes no good, it makes stratis look like a scam, dont you know?
5877 2018-01-25 15:58:22 Yes. Crypto is the evolution of #soundmoney, based on a truly #freemarket of currencies. Everyone should read #FAHayek's #DenationalisationOfMoney (free from @mises Institute)

5880 2018-01-25 15:58:18 Thats is why i think Stellar will do well as a blockchain, as a dex i think it is primed and ready to grow exponentially. Good luck in your work on the chain btw, i’d love to see what you cone up with. Good to see African contributions to crypto.
5881 2018-01-25 15:58:15 I can buy more $ELF with fake, printable money? Fantastic! Will it be offered in a trading pair against the Venezuelan Bolívar next?

5883 2018-01-25 15:57:47 ill hop on it too.. i know bout the whitepaper shitstorm but my opinion is that good devs are here to write a good code and not a good book also you can see the hype about RaiBlocks.. fact is also that bad moves like these arent something which only happens in the crypto space 1/
5884 2018-01-25 15:57:35 I DMOR, trend lines looked good for another run at the time. My confusion is why he’s saying it looks good now. It looks like crap compared to last night. $ICX was an easy call since it bound to go up soon, but $IOST could flatline if it doesn’t pick up steam today.
5885 2018-01-25 15:57:17 That's right! That's why when things go wrong is never because of (lack of) money. Are we any wiser in #crypto from this perspective?
5886 2018-01-25 15:57:17 @justinsuntron here’s a real world situation that proves #tron #trx $trx  can shake things up and provide a service. We believe in you guys!!
5887 2018-01-25 15:57:09 I already follow you
5888 2018-01-25 15:56:58 Don't panic! If you were looking for short term gains, you brought at the wrong time. But if u hodl, and keep hoddling this coin is going far, just research and you'll see how advanced #DigiByteCoin is. Once people realise Bitcoin was beginning, and Altcoins r the future. #UpWeGo

5892 2018-01-25 15:56:42 It's impossible to predict price with 100% certainty, but if there's one thing that always holds true - when coin price surges, it WILL correct. The point here is if you're holding, it would be wise to take some profits. If you're not, consider another coin with better RR.
5893 2018-01-25 15:56:39 What will happen to $BTC in the next 24 hours?
5894 2018-01-25 15:56:31 You are poorly misinformed by the propaganda.  The only reason Bitcoin is slow and expensive is because exchanges refusing to implement segwit 2 and Bad actors like Rodger ver and Company spamming the Bitcoin network with empty blocks
5895 2018-01-25 15:56:30 And now deep thoughts by Crypto Dandy:  Maybe I should integrate leg exercises with Crypto price fluctuations; calf raises when price goes up and lunges when price goes down, you know, no pain no gain. #crypto #cryptodandy

5900 2018-01-25 15:55:59 TRX was actually what made me get into the crypto after reading an article on @justinsuntron. Whether TRON blows up or not, I think his vision for it is awesome. We’ll see!

5902 2018-01-25 15:55:45 Blockchain technology & Crypto currencies have a great impact on our
world today but have yet to be adopted by the masses. Verto Token will
change that by creating a mechanism to seamlessly allow the general public
to use blockchain to perform everyday transactions
5903 2018-01-25 15:55:42 It doesn't need to be the only solution, but it's a working solution right now. There's no concrete evidence bigger blocks will lead to centralization, only ifs and whens. Even the Lightning Network needs bigger blocks according to its whitepaper.

Core devs don't care.
5904 2018-01-25 15:55:06 my boy @crypto_mellow put me on $OST good call. Making money while making money
5905 2018-01-25 15:55:05 JP Morgan already got caught with their hand in the cookie jar after Dimon said "if I ever caught one of my traders buying crypto I'd fire them on the spot for being so stupid" prices plummeted and suddenly a big buy order came in on an exchange from JP Morgan. Lol

5910 2018-01-25 15:54:46 Given the horrible state of HTTPS PKI, it's really hard to ship with HTTPS by default. What happens if you ship an ISO with a CA that should be revoked?

Instead, pkg repo config files and crypto key materials should be easy to edit by the end user.

5923 2018-01-25 15:54:02 This is (very excitedly) strange to me. My investments have always been commercial real estate: solid but very illiquid, transaction window of forever, and a combined strategy of both holding firm & cutting free when you smell a bad deal. Everything in crypto is dead opposite!
5924 2018-01-25 15:53:36 Thanks for letting us know... Much appreciated...
5925 2018-01-25 15:53:29 I've received 6 airdrops since Dec 2017...... #airdrops have worked for me! Haven't put a dime into #crypto yet!
5926 2018-01-25 15:53:23 仮想ってついてる時点で信用できない、みたいな人に仮想通貨の面白さを伝えるの本当難しい。自分自身がアウトプットできるまで理解が追いついていないってことが一つの原因。もう一つはそもそも相手が仮想通貨に興味ないってこと。自ら情報に触れる意欲がない人間に何かを面白いと思わせるハードル高い

5932 2018-01-25 15:53:06 So “Blockchain” is the modern cargo cult for industries desperate for the appearance of progress but really only interested in the digital thumb twiddling of legerizing ANYTHING, no matter how laughably ill-fitted.

5933 2018-01-25 15:53:06 Ok, haha. I was thinking of something weird too sorry man ^^
5934 2018-01-25 15:52:59 Does not crypto currency solve this problem
5935 2018-01-25 15:52:57 Lol crypto
5936 2018-01-25 15:52:54 1. they won't give up the USD as global reserve 2. their corp clients don't want to touch a crypto 3. they make trillions in profit from correspondent banking every year 4. major banks already have a global system in place
5937 2018-01-25 15:52:54 Yes I thought that part was fairly obvious. You could address the watering down of the P2P aspect with LN though.

5939 2018-01-25 15:52:38 Unfortunately, the name of "Switzerland" will soon be tarnished from #crypto permanently.  Similar how the name @johanngevers is now tarnished.  What will they do to resolve #Tezos ICO?
5940 2018-01-25 15:52:30 I dunno man as long as it helps people that really need it
5941 2018-01-25 15:52:17 I'm in on the ICO, hope it goes well!
Looks like their team has been doing a lot of conferences .

5944 2018-01-25 15:52:00 Will do and post here =) Any preferences? or ones that accept bitcoin or crypto?

5946 2018-01-25 15:51:32 price won't last! Expect a big crash! It'll fail in 12 months" that never materialized either.

As long as theres a demand for a decentralized currency, there will be a need for crypto.
5947 2018-01-25 15:51:31  I’ve been chasing it for two days. Good practice for me on avoiding the fomo though
5948 2018-01-25 15:51:26 Also remind this guy Bitcoin is an NSA project and all crypto can go to fucking hell after what it did to the GPU market.
5949 2018-01-25 15:51:25 invest in crypto and he said "I don't put money into things I don't understand." - didn't stop you from badmouthing it apparently.

It's been the same old story for years now. I remember when bitcoin hit $78 and articles were flying through the internet every day saying "this
5950 2018-01-25 15:51:25 Wait a second. This is how "they" are going to preserve capital. While they dole out inflation for everyone else they are going to shift between Fiat and crypto as they rise and fall separately.
5951 2018-01-25 15:51:23 whats that?  volume depreciating in sync with price?

is there any more clear definition of an asset in a Bear Market?

$BTC bitcoin $crypto
5952 2018-01-25 15:51:19 The more Bitcoin is "non" transactional for most intents & purposes, the more $BTC leaves itself in a precarious perch of being MOST valuable in Crypto Space..  but LEAST ABLE... in a sea off Able and Better than Able Crypto's when it comes to moving money, at a great speed/cost.
5953 2018-01-25 15:51:13 Capital is ridiculously abundant in crypto. What the industry needs now are good people deploying that capital to other people with sound mind and the ability to execute. 

Now we have the option of deciding not just who to take money from—but who will be an advocate for autonomy

5955 2018-01-25 15:51:07 @WeissRatings crypto ratings are literally laughable. Service tokens rank high while actual #cryptocurrencies rank low. I would play your list totally contrarian, that's how bad it is. #Bitcoin and #Ripple ranked below #Cardano is absolutely absurd. 
#weissratings
5956 2018-01-25 15:51:02 I'm not talking about trading strategies. I'm saying that Bitcoin Private is crypto snake oil, can you tell me how it's not?

I'm on video 6 of the Bitcoin Private video series and my views have just been further reinforced.
5957 2018-01-25 15:50:57 True. Point taken. And I agree. The problem with all these crypto right now is there is no utility till people hold it for investment.

5971 2018-01-25 15:50:10 @binance_2017 also, a safeguard perhaps where I have to verify the person sending me Coins.

6011 2018-01-25 15:48:24 When it comes to crypto, what authorities want and what authorities will get are two different things. Reg ICO's? they setup elsewhere, Reg traders and exchanges... we make decentralised ones. They lost this game before they realised they were playing it.
6012 2018-01-25 15:48:22 Awesome stuff
6013 2018-01-25 15:48:16 Gotta buy crypto & treat it like a stock. Sell when you're comfortable with return, even if that means missing out if it gets even bigger. If you bought XRP @ .25 cents & sold at $2, if you bought enough that's a really good ROI margin

6031 2018-01-25 15:47:04 MTC and WPD are partner organizations. At least do a little bit of your own research. You can buy MTC parts and 100K+ other items on WPD. Why would an organization spend double the money to write two different terms and conditions. Research the WPD team.

6046 2018-01-25 15:45:48 What they really mean to be saying is that hey want your private information so they know what you're buying with your crypto or how much you made so they can tax the heck out of it.
6047 2018-01-25 15:45:34 I'm hoping for a decent dip, fill in the support gap, fill my bags, and then move on up in a reasonable fashion

6065 2018-01-25 15:44:20 Tomorrows futures expiring is a pivotal day in Bitcoin. Illiquid markets, selling pressure, and panicked investors are a recipe for disaster sooner or later.

6075 2018-01-25 15:43:21 2. Owning crypto is LESS than owning shares, because you own nothing except the shares.  It is like owning the stock of a failed company with no assets, no revenue, and no prospects of ever having one. >>
6076 2018-01-25 15:43:16 and it's a real shame... like some banks in Australia literally closing bank accounts of people that are on crypto exchanges. Utterly ridiculous

6082 2018-01-25 15:41:59 @TeamWinMiner My winminer has been bringing me less than half a cent every 12 hours, whats wrong, is it because of the fall in crypto currencies recently?
6083 2018-01-25 15:41:58 That sucks for people who invested in crypto currency late. 

It’s been going downhill, but my investment is still 2x more than what I put in initially.

6108 2018-01-25 15:40:06 Similar story but I was debt free before getting involved in crypto.  Earned a Full ride to Uni but decided  to take defered loans to invest. Ive been fortunate and can repay the loans 2x+ but prefer to maintain the debt to maximise profit potential  having more chips in play.
6109 2018-01-25 15:40:02 These are all basic signs of a bubble, and once all of this occurs, some significant event will occur causing mass panic and a lot of people will sell. It's going to be a really hard crash. We will recover, but with new regulations. This is what I think...

6119 2018-01-25 15:39:18 As for investment, the starting point is very important to decide whether your investment succeeds or not.

It often happens its price goes down after your investment and you get stressed.

One way to get your good investment start is to invest half of your budget, not all.

6126 2018-01-25 15:38:25 While HOLDers are doing their part to create a bead rock in crypto they also threaten its future by their unwillingness to use their coins as currency and push for institutions to adopt them as alternative methods of payment.

6134 2018-01-25 15:37:53 I was told there would be GAINNNZ in crypto. All I have so far is a bunch of bags, anyone buying BitConnect?
6135 2018-01-25 15:37:42 Such garbage xrp shouldn't even be considered a crypto. Premined private blockchain garbage.
6136 2018-01-25 15:37:27 will see a lot of similarity with CC. More and more people will quit their jobs to earn "free" money with CC. The main topic at a lot of social gatherings will be about CC. And at some point, more and more political discussions will be of CC.
6137 2018-01-25 15:37:26 I actually just sent in a job application to work with the team behind a coin I see some huge potential in. Investing money into something and shilling it is one thing. But devoting your time and effort to seeing that success is next level :)

6139 2018-01-25 15:37:15 Crypto groups that just tell you buy a shitcoin "good news are coming" are just P&D worthless groups, look for groups that actually teach you some TA and give you the charts so you can see for yourself and decide if it's a good entry.

6158 2018-01-25 15:35:33 Even at a weekly withdraw the avg fee pushed $40 a few weeks back. He probably only makes $100/week.

I'm just trying to tell you the fees can and will centralize BTC miners if this trend continues.
6159 2018-01-25 15:35:33 #Cryptocurrency is in a bubble. We have seen smaller "pop" phases in the past with CC now, but imo there will be a big crash, but not at least for another 1-2 years. Anyone that has invested a lot of time reading and learning the details of the past...
6160 2018-01-25 15:35:32 Some people have great ideas and to actualize those ideas they need support for a couple months to focus 100% on the project. I think there is a limit, but to broadly brush off people taking in some funds to support the project from the ground up is not logical.
6161 2018-01-25 15:35:31 $TER says crypto is not their market.  At least not yet --- they see testing in AI growing  -- thinks emerging tech in automotive and other spaces will drive GPU testing.

6166 2018-01-25 15:35:05 Money turns people in to beasts. Travelling through Asia has taught me to be humble. It's a almost a shame to negotiate about a taxi fee of 2$. #crypto might be a solution here, but how ...
6167 2018-01-25 15:35:05 Even if you aren't killing it with hashrate, it doesn't matter. It's about understanding the tech first. New people into crypto should grab a cheap U3 or S1 or even a cheap USB miner and just play around with it. Try different algos, different coins, etc.
6168 2018-01-25 15:34:58 That distance from a working product tho....INT been ballin for some time now
6169 2018-01-25 15:34:55 $ETH sucks balls in using for real-world ecommerce transactions.
6170 2018-01-25 15:34:55 Als crypto-enthousiasteling, geloof ik daar niks van. Bankwezen, zorg, automotive, ICT, muziek, cyber security, cloud oplossingen en bijvoorbeeld stemmen/verkiezingen

6173 2018-01-25 15:34:47 It also depends on your holding philosophy. If you catch something in its infancy - let's consider the scenario of a dash masternode - a few grand has now become $1mm plus, along with continued reward cycles.
6174 2018-01-25 15:34:39 Lol, crowdsourcing at its finest
6175 2018-01-25 15:34:24 It's not about avg. BTC isn't for the "average" person. It's for everyone, and mostly for people in countries that are below that average, as they need it more. The thing is that 2x doesn't solve anything. 2mb will fill too. Then 4mb, etc. It's not a solution. Stop-gap measure.

6179 2018-01-25 15:34:01 True but people WILL jump in big time if BTC drops to 9K or so.
6180 2018-01-25 15:33:59 If you're in Crypto, don't panic when the market moves drastically in the wrong direction. It's volatile, remember, NYSE averages 8% gains FOR THE YEAR! Crypto averages 10% A DAY.

6187 2018-01-25 15:33:32 It's the best way to understand and learn the tech, IMO. I spent 1-2 years testing mining, research the functionality, understanding why it exists, and getting myself familiar with the tech of crypto before I ever even created an exchange account.
6188 2018-01-25 15:33:06 That is the difficulty in believing in crypto-currency. It is backed by nothing, supported by no one, and accountable to no one.

6235 2018-01-25 15:28:35 Venezuela/Zimbabwe adopted cryptocurrency only because central deep state banks were scamming & stealing from them by only allowing a daily limit to withdrawals. Banks fear crypto because it allows people to "unbank" and have their own funding. They won't stop corruption so F it.

6262 2018-01-25 15:25:47 Just had a thought; the market was really bullish when they all opened so there would have to be a LOT of people to think it was bearish to really affect it now right? Should be a good weekend then.

6264 2018-01-25 15:25:35 I agree with the sentiment of staying strong in our faith in crypto however HODLing as the only course of action is ludicrous!

6274 2018-01-25 15:24:41 But but but why not regulate the company's giving fiat to crypto and visa versa. If you sell your crypto for fiat you pay a tax fee? That would be way much easier to regulate. I mean, I get that you have to pay, I'd rather not but still, let's make it ourselves easy.

6300 2018-01-25 15:22:32 The ability and desire to read helps more than anything, at least watch videos made by accredited experienced crypto experts. Although you can do pretty well just following the pump majority with most likes too

6304 2018-01-25 15:22:04 Okay well, thanks for the insight! Not sure I feel the same but thanks for the opinion.
6305 2018-01-25 15:22:01 It would have a bigger community.  The success of a crypto depends on the size of its community n how it decides on the crypto more so then the tech behind it.
6306 2018-01-25 15:21:51 26th January will decide future of Bitcoin price, I hope CME and these jerks leave crypto space

6312 2018-01-25 15:21:05 I hereby declare that when I meet @bradmillscan in person I'm gonna grab him & shake him "gently" (but vigorously!) & remind him 2 be NEUTRAL n UNBIASED n UNATTACHED towards all cryptos as a trader. NO CRYPTO PETS & "THIS IS MY FAVORITE CRYPTO" are allowed in crypto trading! LOL!

6318 2018-01-25 15:20:25 I'm a noob, but I really think all the claims that crypto has hit mainstream adoption are far from true.

In the early age of the internet. There was one-ish gateway, AOL. I remember sitting at the computer for 5-10 minutes waiting for internet to connect.

6352 2018-01-25 15:16:46 Hmmm, I was really convinced that my last sentence made sense when I wrote it. I now realize it doesn't.  But concerning style premia requiring liquidity: Isn't size/illiquidity a risk premium by itself and arguably already in play in crypto?
6353 2018-01-25 15:16:45 When I first started, I felt like mining was the safest way to start if you're tech savvy but not a trader. Reinvest the gains into the rig and learn to trade with the net profits.
6354 2018-01-25 15:16:35 You better be unhappy with a big bag of crypto than unhappy without any money

6373 2018-01-25 15:15:25 36 million is the hard cap, this includes private, pre, and main token sale and there are 350 million tokens for sale in total. the base price should be 10 cents each. not 24 cents. So technically even with bonus of 45% with your base of 24 cents is about 14.4 cents per token.

6390 2018-01-25 15:14:22 The worst that’s happened to crypto recently is lack of knowledge being treated as authority. Futures pricing, bad reporting from traditional news, Weiss ratings. Seriously, go learn crypto before opening your mouth. #cryptocurrency #bitcoin $btc

6393 2018-01-25 15:14:09 Surely you don't class Crypto as a job and more of as a hobby? Unless you take it extremely seriously idk.

Also, unlike real payment methods, you can't dispute a charge after a scam and get your money back.

6409 2018-01-25 15:12:49 Agreed, it will take time to see this pan out but it definitely defeats the purpose of crypto being free of government control BUT often new technologies get used in different ways than originally intended so let's see how this experiment pans out. Thx for your feedback
6410 2018-01-25 15:12:46 I would be interested in accepting crypto currency at my businesses. However, I feel the concern in accepting crypto as payment is their speculative nature and volatility. How might Linda coin solve this risk for businesses such as myself? #Lindacoin
6411 2018-01-25 15:12:40 AND it's a great way to give to NGOs tax free. Since crypto is currently considered an asset, the nonprofit doesn't have to pay capital gains.

6413 2018-01-25 15:12:36 You are talking bullshit.

On a relative basis, there are more scammers in crypto currencies than in regular payments. There is a whole subreddit dedicated to people losing money in various stupid ways in crypto currencies.

6424 2018-01-25 15:11:31 I did that with BTC when i first bought in to Crypto. Plus, I even bought it on what I thought was a dip? Then got bad news & a huge correction. I will only buy BTC on a major correction & the small caps on a correction or big dip. Lesson learned. ITX is a great project HODL.
6425 2018-01-25 15:11:21 Bitcoin, XRP, TRX and others all dropped 50+% after their rallies. This isn't opinion - it actually happened. It amazes me how newcomers can be so blinded by their gains that, for a moment, they think they actually know more than those that have been in the space for years.

6433 2018-01-25 15:10:40 A whole bitcoin is hardly a "micro" transaction. Who would be willing to pay $5 transaction fee for a cup of coffee?
6434 2018-01-25 15:10:28 United States has roughly 269 trillion in total assets. 1% drop wipes out 2.69 trillion, or roughly 5 times the Entire crypto market cap at this time
6435 2018-01-25 15:10:24 Totally defeats the purpose. A decentralized ledger is there so as to not depend on a single entity or government to control the currency.
6436 2018-01-25 15:10:20 Damn.. aslong he uses bitcoin for money circulation and bringing his A+ celebs to invest or use it. Leave him be. Great addition to the crypto world.
6437 2018-01-25 15:10:17 La crypto money est encore tellement spéculative, que même en Europe les économistes ont encore des aprioris et sont dubitatifs sur l’avenir de cette money.Combien de fois, pour nos économistes de l’ancienne technologie!

6441 2018-01-25 15:10:12 可愛い！
6442 2018-01-25 15:10:03 Lol what is your point?? It's meaningless. They pay in USD, then you exchange it to DAV and finally to BTC, there you have your money. Probably less because you paid some fees but obviously more than you can get with a bank.
6443 2018-01-25 15:09:59 Agreed, thanks guys. Adbank rocks!

6461 2018-01-25 15:08:23 I think ELF has great volume (100M+ on Binance), @crypto_rand recommended this coin a week ago. Fundamentally I don't know anything about $ELF yet, so I can't give you an opinion on that. I do know there's hype, however after a run like this one be aware of a slight drop.
6462 2018-01-25 15:08:21 Is that #crypto for crypto currency or cryptic presentation

6465 2018-01-25 15:08:15 Profit takers, not long time hodlers - VeChain is not a quick flip and that's where it draws its strength from. Why sell a coin that will bring passive income from all of the partnerships its acquiring? Impatience.
6466 2018-01-25 15:08:07 Yeah I hear that, I'm not really a trader, but I think holding onto masternodes is a massive opportunity cost, potentially holding you back from other opportunities (ICOs, undervalued assets, etc). Pretty interesting discussion though
6467 2018-01-25 15:08:02 Mining is life. A3 arrives tomorrow! ASICs are like crack.
6468 2018-01-25 15:08:01 Hopefully you played #Stellar like I did. Up 25% against #bitcoin from two days ago. Should sustain the run for at least 3-5 days. Might have a bump at the 6200 spot.

6474 2018-01-25 15:07:36 Best news for crypto I read this week
6475 2018-01-25 15:07:32 Since my workload is light this week *knock on wood* I'm going to try to get at least one crypto item marked off my todo list.
6476 2018-01-25 15:07:29 Haha not what I meant. Keep doing an awesome job for the crypto-space Bob :)
6477 2018-01-25 15:07:25 "Poloz then turned to the idea of a central bank issued digital currency, and said that if it were to create one, it would be backed by the Canadian dollar. He added that cash is "still doing its job" and that there is no rush to introduce it."
6478 2018-01-25 15:07:24 I think Mr Back showed how far out of touch with crypto he is when he suggested tabs.. He should stick to his "aggressive trading"
6479 2018-01-25 15:07:20 Lets schedule an episode next week to talk about this on ur channel or ours cuz i think its important that folks understand the advantages/disadvantages of trading vs staking on ur channel or mine. makes no difference.
6480 2018-01-25 15:07:14 僕も同じこと思ったｗ
6481 2018-01-25 15:07:14 we can wait until january 26 before 16 gmt...., that's right, better before than after.

6493 2018-01-25 15:06:01 @aelfblockchain thanks for doing all this, such a great way to get into crypto-currency
6494 2018-01-25 15:05:34 But just because you earn 30% doesn't also mean it's immune to downward swings in crypto either.. Whole market goes down, your masternode will decrease in price with it
6495 2018-01-25 15:05:26 What is fair market price for ETH long term?  #ETH has a particular use; it allows you to run things on the #Ethereum distributed database.  If the price gets too high, no one will be able to afford to build things using Ethereum, and devs will switch to other platforms. #crypto
6496 2018-01-25 15:05:24 What She's sayin' : It's ADMINISTRATIVELY closed, son : That means, it was read and tossed in the TRASH : Take responsibility for your OWN financial decisions : Everyone knows everything in crypto is SPECULATIVE : They don't wanna hear it & that's GOOD for #crypto
6497 2018-01-25 15:05:22 I’ve just started crypto recently, my idea was always going to be long term investments not selling everyday for profit, currently got about 2000 $SPHTX $QASH $WABI AND $XRP, am I doing it right if not what should I be doing ? Help would be appreciated 
6498 2018-01-25 15:05:22 Hello, how looking tax in crypto in netherlands? @Crypto_wizzard
6499 2018-01-25 15:05:19 Depends on financial goals n trading abilities. If I don't know how to trade or invest properly, then I would go for the staking rewards cuz its more conservative. Since I know how to trade, i'm going after the big multiples n stake on the side w/@decredproject & @ParticlProject

6503 2018-01-25 15:05:10 Everyone out here assuming institutional investors came to buy. 

Important: they also know how about buy low sell high. 

Don't tell crypto-Twitter. 
6504 2018-01-25 15:05:05 なんというかIDEXむちゃくちゃ使いやすい、というか私の中でいいポジションにいる（大体最速レベルで買える、多分今だけだけどガラパゴス価格で美味しい銘柄ある）ので、人増えそう。取引所トークンもあるし、つまり... #よくわからない
6505 2018-01-25 15:04:56 Yeah, but much more payments happen the "standard" way. Scamming is much higher on a relative basis, in crypto currencies.
6506 2018-01-25 15:04:42 The bubble might be in the near future but only for Bitcoin. The market will dip to all time lows if the Bitcoin bubble pops. But from there the growth of each coin will be independent and we won't see swings like we are seeing now.

6514 2018-01-25 15:04:02 #WhenIGetToldNo I keep mining that crypto.
6515 2018-01-25 15:04:00 Agreed Kevin. The thing is, it seems to me like most crypto companies are not really focusing as much on driving usage at this point as compared to the tech. Some only focus on the tech.
6516 2018-01-25 15:03:58 It's one you use though. Where did you get it from? Or whose definition is it? A particular anarchist thinker?

6519 2018-01-25 15:03:28 I've found the amount to buy in to a masternode generally cost prohibitive.
6520 2018-01-25 15:03:07 I don’t think he is a scam. He knows TA so when it’s going to turn around he sells before the drop and then he will rebuy at the bottom before the reversal again. I do it with all my coins too. That’s how we ride our coins up. Nothing wrong with Double dipping. Learn TA
6521 2018-01-25 15:03:06 I say crypto snake oil because it's adding nothing, has nothing unique, and is just marketing fluff. 

What's innovative about Bitcoin Private aside from making the founders more money?

What does Bitcoin Private have to do with Bitcoin? It's a fork of Zclassic.
6522 2018-01-25 15:03:03 After yesterday's threads on WireGuard, I read the whitepaper. I can't talk crypto but do I read this right that if attacker gets public key & sends 0xFFFFFFFF as timestamp, it totally nullifies use of that key until restart (ignoring compromise issue)? @EdgeSecurity @tqbf
6523 2018-01-25 15:03:02 That's like saying "Ten-year old child can barely speak; probably has a Down syndrome". Other children (payment methods) did much better at this age.

6528 2018-01-25 15:02:31 I think paying a fee for education about bad investments would be a better strategy, but both are probably better than what most crypto investors are doing right now.
6529 2018-01-25 15:02:30 I agree with regulation 100%! But to frame #bitcoin as the go-to money laundering vehicle for perpetrators of high crime is a stretch. The bad guys use hard #FIAT currency, far too much heat & effort trying to convert crypto into cash.

6537 2018-01-25 15:02:04 I guess it depends how greedy an individual is. But I was looking into masternodes today and it is hard to pull yourself away from the smaller coins returning 300%+

6551 2018-01-25 15:00:57 The current fees make Bitcoin impractical for micro-transactions. It will only get worse as the block reward shrinks and the miners have to sustain themselves from the transaction fees. Even now it's cheaper to wire money (not to mention safer and easier).

6571 2018-01-25 14:59:33 When I started out in crypto I aimed to have the same knowledge of it as I do in gaming. With gaming I know all of the big players, current trends and controversies. Once you have a foundation of knowledge it only takes a little bit of reading each week to keep on top of it.

6573 2018-01-25 14:59:10 Gan tweet about your crypto currency
6574 2018-01-25 14:58:57 Bitcoin has properties that make it easier to con people. Hard to regulate, hard to trace the origin, no chargebacks - ideal for the scammers. Plus hard for the average person to understand and use - meaning he's more likely to screw up.
6575 2018-01-25 14:58:55 So you're saying Crypto may permissibly mean cryptocurrency.
6576 2018-01-25 14:58:55 Just 3 days away for the most awaited ICO of the year. @daneelproject already have the attention of the crypto world. It has a real idea of developing a AI base cryptocurrency Q & A system using the technology of IBM's Watson.  #Daneel #TokenSale #AI #ICO
6577 2018-01-25 14:58:52 Curious about masternode "passive income" versus investors shooting for the multiple X returns.. 5-30% "passive" income sounds incredible in traditional markets, but not when others are raking in +100% annually

6581 2018-01-25 14:58:32 Yeah, but your videos have excellent information.  Unlike 90% of the crypto videos out there that have dudes wearing stupid sunglasses and flashy animation- those guys are super annoying.  I wish I had a filter to skip past them all. Keep up the teaching!!
6582 2018-01-25 14:58:12 Just typical that very soon when i get my first high end system that ill be getting it when the prices are at an all time fixed maximum and we are getting extorted on ddr4 and gpu prices up the wazoo with the convenient excuse of crypto , system cost now £2500 , £1900 last year
6583 2018-01-25 14:58:09 Let's open a small embassy quickly, and for no good reason besides owning dumb libs, before thinking of the security ramifications.
6584 2018-01-25 14:58:07 Not a bubble.  The total market cap is still pretty small.  That's the key figure to watch for.  It will be several trillion in a few years.

6589 2018-01-25 14:57:24 @Haejin_Crypto The best advice at cryptos is never put all the eggs in the same basket. I learned that from you. Thanks!
6590 2018-01-25 14:57:23 I'm not betting anything. I'm just pointing out what a shitty currency it is. Even the criminals are dropping it these days. Even a Bitcoin conference stopped taking Bitcoin payments - isn't that the hoot.
6591 2018-01-25 14:57:22 The power behind bitcoin creation IS backing bitcoin, which is exactly the case. That plus scarcity (which is not guaranteed by inflated money). There are plenty of Ponzi schemes in emerging crypto space but bitcoin is definitely not one of them...
6592 2018-01-25 14:57:12 Anyone interested in #cryptocurrencies should check out @crypto_bobby and @carterthomas podcasts/YouTube videos. Objective and fair views, no ridiculous predictions and no coin pumping like many other channels!

6594 2018-01-25 14:57:08 To save itself maybe GE needs to announce its coming out with its own crypto.  Hey, it worked for Kodak.

6596 2018-01-25 14:57:03 Buying more Crypto while the market is still low. I don't expect the market to boom until the end of February. Investing more in $TRX @DsplusF $VEE $FUN $TEL

6598 2018-01-25 14:56:35 Naast reguleren (sturing naar onderdrempel) kunnen we ook "kwaliteitszegels" voeren (sturing naar bovendremel)

De waarheid bevind zich ergens tussen crypto-wildwesten en paternalistische ("ik weet wat het beste is voor jou") bemoeienis
6599 2018-01-25 14:56:29 Oh, salty = angry? Agreed. Sry for previous grumpy tweet. Back to my main point. USD has value because Uncle Sam forces you to pay taxes in USD. Uncle Sam does not accept crypto as payment of taxes. This doesn't mean you don't have to pay USD taxes on your crypto gains. Cheerio.

6605 2018-01-25 14:55:59 I can't wait for crypto to crash again so GPUs will become affordable again...

6610 2018-01-25 14:55:17 I don’t think $TWTR is done growing. It has been rapidly taking mainstream with politics and crypto waves and only time will tell when it might be the most reliable and chaotic means to get information. Yes - people love chaos
6611 2018-01-25 14:55:17 I have also the faith in #HTMLCOIN and think it is the best investment to do in Crypto. Good team, good partnership with @MichaelStollair and products the market is looking for. I started in crypto with Verge and the community supporting the product is very much the same.
6612 2018-01-25 14:55:04 Read my email again. It’s all ICO come ons that start out “Dear Crypto Influencer” and end with proposed trades of integrity for promotion. Thanks but no thanks.

6627 2018-01-25 14:53:35 Anarchism comes from 'without chiefs', which usually means without government. Your definition of anarchism as the total absence of any law or cooperation - honestly, I can't think of any author who thought this. Every anarchist I've read seems to fit your definition of agorism.

6647 2018-01-25 14:51:23 all crypto projects are in beta, I don't see ripple/XRP adoption on mass scale as well to be fair, so its coming its coming as well... lets hope all is ready for a possible transition from the old system into a new crypto system and of course before a possible banking crisis...

6650 2018-01-25 14:50:52 The fact that crypto hasn’t cratered entirely now that btc is largely useless for transactions tells me there is still some beautiful hope out there to be exploited

6658 2018-01-25 14:50:12 As a rule of TA the more in the market, the less efficient it becomes. Especially when the Funds come in. Just look at Equity Market, can't TA that for shit
6659 2018-01-25 14:50:04 そらひどいっすなあ…

6660 2018-01-25 14:50:00 Rather than inventing a new paradigm, why not just value cryptos based on imputed cash flows?

IE: A crypto owner owns X capacity on the network. How much would someone who needs to transact on the network have to pay me for my capacity for Y period of time. Rent, basically.
6661 2018-01-25 14:49:59 Have a look at Sweetbridge. @sweetbridgeinc looking to create a stable crypto that can be used to release equity from assets in the supply chain.

6667 2018-01-25 14:49:29 Your definition of anarchy - can you point to any thinkers or authors who espouse it? I can't, and politics was my major. The only thing that comes close is perhaps Rousseau's depiction of man before society; even then, no one takes that literally.

6671 2018-01-25 14:48:53 Bullish on $XRP despite all the FUD. I low of .85 was the start of the 1 wave of a 5 wave impulse. We completed wave 2 at 1.12 and we could be in wave 2 . target 2 to 2.2 USD
6672 2018-01-25 14:48:47 Lots of things are bubbles and it's ok.   Namely the US housing market stopped a lot of my parents generation right in their tracks financially before their retirements.  The main difference being you can't "casually" invest in a house with little obligation like crypto.

6742 2018-01-25 14:41:37 Correct. Since crypto is in the news there is unprecedented interest. I get it. In many cases, there would be an announcement.  "We are working on (x) problem. It takes (y) to get there but don't worry your funds r safe" is normally how that would go.

6751 2018-01-25 14:40:49 This is particularly true. In Quant Finance no Stoch models work unless it’s equities-focused. This is because humans refuse to understand that asset classes have evolved beyond cash flow producing models, and that value can now be derived from a variable of intangibles #Crypto

6827 2018-01-25 14:33:47 Well... it are a couply of hype cycles combined in one... but Bitcoin itself is too complcated to be seen as one bubble. The entire Blockchain technology is currently being 'bubbled'. The market will mature and root out the so called 'shitcoins'
6828 2018-01-25 14:33:38 Yes. The hack was not an issue of IOTA but rather a third party. The market never reacted to  it but instead continued It's trend destined to fall without major positive news

6849 2018-01-25 14:32:09 “My number one focus on cryptocurrencies, whether that be digital currencies or bitcoin...is that we want to make sure that they're not used for illicit activities” 
- Steven Mnuchin (Treasury)

USD is used for illicit activities more than crypto.

But that’s none of my business.

6851 2018-01-25 14:31:54 $DRWN with big crypto news out this morning
6852 2018-01-25 14:31:43 2 all of my new crypto friends, if U find yourself getting frustrated with the movement of your favorite coins, Go onto coinmarket cap & hit the historical snap shot icon. Look at where some of the top priced coins where just at the beginning of 2017! #KeepyaHeadUp&HandsStrong 
6853 2018-01-25 14:31:37 Hey cryptogoat if u ever wanna go n visit middle east don't go lonely when u hear durkah durkah durkah.
They might fucking rape u 
6854 2018-01-25 14:31:32 (Not saying that Crypto can’t be valued – not educated enough to have an opinion there.)
6855 2018-01-25 14:31:29 Don't lie to us your magic internet triangles and trend lines built impassable barriers in the market.  Now the question is now that you've built the wall did you make $OST pay for it?
6856 2018-01-25 14:31:26 Coin sadece oyunlarda mı kullanılacak yoksa kardan pay da verecekler mi ? sadece bahis için kullanılacaksa bir anlamı yok crypto bu değil kesinlikle.
6857 2018-01-25 14:31:18 It actually IS a bubble in the sense that most coins are shit and will disappear. Moreover, the creation of new shitcoins will see a decline within the next 3 years. That's as far as I'll go where the bubble is concerned. For the rest, this is new tech and 'bubble' doesn't apply.
6858 2018-01-25 14:31:13 Trop tôt pour connaître l'effet des Futures sur le marché. CME peut avoir inciter des gens à investir dans la crypto, CME peut manipuler le marché question d'avoir le prix le plus rentable pour eux, ça peut être la peur à échéance qui provoque des panic sell...
6859 2018-01-25 14:31:12 بس كدة مبقتش سرية :D
6860 2018-01-25 14:31:10 Of course it's not 'crashing,' not yet in any case. It was a joke regarding how quick they were to put that label on crypto market, even though we've seen worse periods for bitcoin.

6862 2018-01-25 14:31:02 DeepBrain Chain, $DBC, is where EOS  was a few months ago ($0,50). If good technology, great vision and proper profit don't excite you, I don't know what will - in crypto space.

6865 2018-01-25 14:30:48 My personal goal is to make life changing money in USD like you, but then stack as much Bitcoin as I can.

I trade crypto to make more Bitcoin.

I also want to propagate good info about the revolution of money, not promote the shit I buy to make more Bitcoin.
6866 2018-01-25 14:30:40 Technical analysis and TA shows that the next 7 days might be very bullish for crypto market. So enjoy trading and take many profits. However, we should wait until tomorrow when futures Btc contracts end.
6867 2018-01-25 14:30:40 As usual, Louise's "news" is as #fake as it comes.
6868 2018-01-25 14:30:39 By the end of 2018, I expect that $EOS will be ranked in the top three largest #crypto projects by market cap, behind only $BTC and maybe $ETH. By the end of 2019, I suspect it will be #1. By holding $EOS tokens, you have a stake in the decentralized ecosystem of the future
6869 2018-01-25 14:30:34 Don't weigh a person's past more than their present and future #inspiration

6920 2018-01-25 14:26:27 This is simply discusting the way you treat your clients. Your customers services is below anything.

6924 2018-01-25 14:26:09 Tell me one coin in crypto history that has NOT been called a shitcoin or scam?  So what else is new?  Btw... ur doing ur clients at alphabit a total disservice in not having them participate with at minimum a small position in the most revolutionary airdrop in crypto history!
6925 2018-01-25 14:26:05 Always good advice. You are in my top 7 Crypto gurus, that had 5 letters in their name and start with B.

6928 2018-01-25 14:25:52 Totally agree

6930 2018-01-25 14:25:31 I think what @CRYPTOBANGer is alluding to is there is unhealthy narrative right now in crypto where a lot of new people get sucked in to these projects by mass community shilling when they've already gone up so much and commit investing suicide by buying in (see XVG and TRX)
6931 2018-01-25 14:25:27 This is for the people in the US, if you want to help with crypto adoption vote in a younger crowd of politicians. The old guard never wants to change. Electing 70yo senators stuck in their biased ways never leads to real change. Vote in a younger crowd folks

6987 2018-01-25 14:20:26 #LifeTalkLive @thomaspower. because crypto is going up in value, people are holding it and getting pd in it.
6988 2018-01-25 14:20:26 @CashApp can you send and receive bitcoin with this app. I see that you can buy it. But is it a btc wallet?
6989 2018-01-25 14:20:19 Great news for @aelfblockchain ! #crypto #airdrop
6990 2018-01-25 14:20:16 @leviarcoin_fdn so what comes first in Feb? New exchanges? Roadmap? Whitepaper? I'm tempted to buy more but need something, anything to give me and others a glimmer of hope that we are backing a good horse #xlc #crypto #sumo #ETH
6991 2018-01-25 14:20:12 love the explantions for why its primed
6992 2018-01-25 14:20:03 Revolving credit to purchase and sell homes or even purchase and rent homes is pretty common practice. There are people who are astronomically wealty yet still purchase on credit.  You can borrow 3 grand at 0% interest for 5 years. Do you borrow the money and invest it in crypto?
6993 2018-01-25 14:20:02 If it were a decentralized cryptocurrency, then censorship (i.e., a regulatory ban) wouldn't matter.

Is why a decentralized blockchain coin is different from M-Pesa, Ripple, Bonga points, etc. And is why the markets value most those coins w/ best protections against censorship.
6994 2018-01-25 14:20:00 It's actually on @COBINHOOD too. Very solid coin indeed. One of the best outside the  30

6996 2018-01-25 14:19:57 お疲れ様でした。
6997 2018-01-25 14:19:51 I have wayyyyy more FOMO around connecting with people before they 10x and become famous vs any fancy crypto.
6998 2018-01-25 14:19:50 How is it that most crypto coin prices seem to be moving together?  Is big money so clueless that it buys and sells the market (every coin) as a whole? or is it manipulation?  Interesting price movements lately...
6999 2018-01-25 14:19:38 天使のような太陽の笑顔・・・ネコニーです！
7000 2018-01-25 14:19:30 No worries :>
7001 2018-01-25 14:19:28 #LifeTalkLive @thomaspower crypto creates currency for geeks/tech. ICO= Initial Crypto Offering.
7002 2018-01-25 14:19:27 ^ This guy gets it.
7003 2018-01-25 14:19:18 The real question is: what will you do to reduce debt and further grow the company now that you clearly reached the limit that acquisition has on the value of the company. The market today responds to Innovators and Visionnaires! Buying a #TeslaTruck or two does not cut it :)
7004 2018-01-25 14:19:07 Yup
7005 2018-01-25 14:19:06 gonna set up a twitter profile tweeting polls with Food or Crypto
7006 2018-01-25 14:19:01 I wouldn't worry. If we even got around to looking at it we'd just look at ways to track the criminal aspect of it like the FBI tracks the blockchain. We don't care about it destroying the precious USD
7007 2018-01-25 14:18:51 Exactly
7008 2018-01-25 14:18:50 Fair point, I will do that.
Nonetheless, the timing of Tether print and the suspicious behavior/activity is too much to ignore.
IMHO the silence of the crypto community is deafening.
7009 2018-01-25 14:18:49 ！？
ホントに書いてくれるんですかやったー！
なんか、今まで見たこと無い視点で書かれた、新鮮で良い記事でした！
こーゆー楽しみ方もいいですよね！
7010 2018-01-25 14:18:38 I’m still skeptical of the crypto-craze, but I am curious about how blockchain can strengthen institutions like property rights in developing nations.
7011 2018-01-25 14:18:36 今は全体が元気ないですからねー。自分のターンがどっかでくるはずです！お互い頑張りましょう(*ﾟ▽ﾟ*)
7012 2018-01-25 14:18:35 Good luck with that long term hold. Lol
7013 2018-01-25 14:18:28 What could you possibly do with fiat, that you can’t do with crypto as well?? Give me one relevant example!
7014 2018-01-25 14:18:27 Price per Token is too high, I'm passing.
7015 2018-01-25 14:18:19 The real question is: what will you do to reduce debt and further grow the company now that you clearly reached the limit that acquisition has on the value of the company. The market today responds to Innovators and Visionnaires!
7016 2018-01-25 14:18:09 #LifeTalkLive @thomaspower crypto currencies are like asset classes (AI & IoT). Nation states will be cryptostates. We will all hangout in our ecospheres. But no Google, Amazon or Facebook in crypto yet.
7017 2018-01-25 14:18:03 En l'occurence la blockchain n'a rien à faire avec les employés. Il ne faut pas voir le mal partout et savoir apprécier quand il y'a aussi du bon :) Il n'y a pas de raison de parler de licenciements sur un tweet a propo de la crypto, hors sujet voilà tout :)
7018 2018-01-25 14:17:55 #crypto starting to wake up? a few nice looking entry points in the charts

7022 2018-01-25 14:17:17 Bitcoin is the currency of crypto world. It’s only good for other people in crypto, just as the USD are only good for people in the US. You can’t use EUR, GBP, Yen, Pesos in the US either, not just Bitcoin.
7023 2018-01-25 14:17:07 #Crypto market stabilizing. @ethereumproject / #ETH is still a killer hold. @Ripple / #XRP may be bleeding out from here on out. Hox's picks of the day are @vechainofficial / #VEN, @StellarOrg / #XLM, @NEMofficial / #XEM. #cryptocurrency #bitcoin #BTC #LTC #HVTG
7024 2018-01-25 14:17:07 $10K support, higher lows, 6/12/1D/3D RSI Crossing, higher volume/momentum, beginning Adam and Eve, futures expires on Friday, Korea good to go, 800 BTC sell wall eaten (ETH/BTC)..

7030 2018-01-25 14:16:32 If you’re involved in a Pump and Dump scheme on Crypto... REMEMBER... you ALWAYS have Asymmetrical knowledge. You’ll be late to buy when it’s announced and late/early to sell. It’s a lose lose. Play a game you can win. #HODL #PumpandDump

7052 2018-01-25 14:14:13 That’s the core principle of capital economy. The only problem with crypto today is that 90% of people who invest do not understand how it works. They can’t even explain it to anyone when asked...thus leading to the perception of bubble.

7069 2018-01-25 14:13:13 That is right - I don't wish to create any FUD - as on twitter even good critic can be taken as a reason for dump by our new investors all across crypto. But honestly there is huge manipulation. Regulated markets have their issues but this is beyond all that.

7108 2018-01-25 14:10:48 Now just get it back to 1.00$ where you shilled it last time  my fault for losses though, shoulda had a sell order ready AND it did go 20% before all the blood to be fair haha.
7109 2018-01-25 14:10:35 That ATH will become a distant memory in the near future.

7115 2018-01-25 14:10:04 Everyone has been wrong about verge
7116 2018-01-25 14:10:03 Of course you can.
It requires very little liquidity most of the time and the same occurs when other traders with big followings post a chart or when mcafee shills a coin, even 10-20x the marketcap as the one you just stated.
7117 2018-01-25 14:09:54 Ledgers are horrible. They have outdated apps for each coin, none of them work well. Last time I wanted to sell crypto I couldn’t access my funds, even from @myetherwallet integration, had to use @TREZOR to solve this. BTW, my ledger wallet is a replacement from a broken one.

一応僕は＄9000から＄7000で少しずつ分散して買い注文を出しておくことにします。
7120 2018-01-25 14:09:29 Cashed out the last bit today of what i was planning to. Now just letting the rest ride untill i reach a specific target i set for myself earlier.

Gives a lot of peace of mind and free time.

7126 2018-01-25 14:08:54 Have I missed the serious articles blaming crypto for dollar weakness because I figured there’d be more of them?
7127 2018-01-25 14:08:49 Why did you get into crypto then? Just to make dollars?
7128 2018-01-25 14:08:47 yea, i still think fomo hasnt kicked in, juat hoping @BittrexExchange comes through....hoping @binance_2017 can list $ZCL too....

7132 2018-01-25 14:08:12 I've known lots of people who have bought drugs (and cupcakes) with fiat over the years. No one I know to my knowledge has with crypto. Ban fiat?

7134 2018-01-25 14:07:57 What do you expect from someone whose lips are permanently attached to the #BogusPOTUS butt? How many "crypto rubles" has he received?? #NoTrumpNoGaetz
7135 2018-01-25 14:07:52 You'll know when the time is near.. They have released the wallet. The tokens swap is pending (which will be allowed a few days or 1-2 weeks.. there'll be issues etc).. The exchange has to incorporate their blockchain which would take time too.. Seems like 2 weeks away to me..
7136 2018-01-25 14:07:51 You are great. I’ve done well with vol products since June 2017. Now need to learn futures and crypto from you.
7137 2018-01-25 14:07:51 I bought in on all time high on a lot of crypto so I’m just holding onto it until it booms or bust to 0
7138 2018-01-25 14:07:47 The news of #Vechain #VEN  yesterday during the stream was interesting but it could be marketed better. wonder if that is why it went down, or is it a classic case 'buy the rumour sell the news'?  #Crypto #Tradinh @CryptoNetGroup @JordyMin @vechainofficial
7139 2018-01-25 14:07:47 I don't like that it is depreciating asset n I cant find one person that likes it either...However, I don't sit there in fairy tale land thinking that just cuz i don't like it that i can just pay my bills n taxes in crypto. I measure gains in US dollars cuz thats what biz accept.

7148 2018-01-25 14:07:02 This is what happens when you get people that don't understand risk and think that crypto investing is a sure thing. All Tre did was show people what he was doing and how well it was working for him. He didn't force anyone to invest. That was all your own FOMO.

7167 2018-01-25 14:05:05 This shows new users why #crypto is not ready for mass adoption as people are able to manipulate users by making false claims and calling their product/altcoin the real $BTC.

7207 2018-01-25 14:01:17 I think everyone in the crypto community is wise to the fact that once they declare their token is backed by a security they are suddenly under the purview of the SEC instead of the Fed. And the SEC has an axe to grind.

7243 2018-01-25 13:57:44 Like... No shit. People who are most affected by inflation are more likely to invest in crypto.

7248 2018-01-25 13:57:13 This just goes to prove that robbing BTC is not that easy... Imagine if it was fiat, theyd be gone in 60sec! Another reason why crypto is the future!

7316 2018-01-25 13:50:48 Not a very good one compared to what? Compared to almost EVERY other good in the market (especially over <5 yrs), fiat is a superior SoV. It is only a small class of scarce goods ie precious metals and art (too early to tell with any particular crypto) that outperform fiat as SoV
7317 2018-01-25 13:50:42 Net als bv in de video branche is het ook zeker niet zo dat het beste product gaat winnen, het Philips systeem was ook beter dan VHS en toch won VHS, dat zal in de crypto’s waarschijnlijk ook gaan gebeuren. Toch zijn er al wel wat ‘winnaars’ aan te wijzen en is de markt enorm.

7353 2018-01-25 13:47:00 - Discount on all fees of the platform
- Profit sharing model for token holders. (You buy back some % of the total supply with a portion of your profits).

Those two alone would be enough to align the token with the success of the platform.

Looking forward to seeing it :)

7364 2018-01-25 13:45:32 @officialmcafee Have you seen the latest Davor announcement that they will allow people to get their capital back after 14 days? Perhaps it's time to give the best crypto lending platform a good mention. They have worked hard to deserve it.
7365 2018-01-25 13:45:20 Volatility is problematic but there is no reason to believe this is a fatality, that crypto will never ever stabilise or have a slower moving timeframe
FYI: gold increased 150% between 2008 and 2012 and then lost 35% the following year.
Gold is a hopeless and useless asset right?

Since crypto networks are peer-to-peer, they don't rely on a single omnipotent caretaker like a bank or business to operate effectively.

Each transaction is then recorded in a publically distributed ledger called a "blockchain". 

Stay tuned.

7432 2018-01-25 13:39:38 Mocht u in crypto’s willen gaan handelen dan raad ik u aan om eerst bij mij een serie privélessen te nemen. Doet u dat niet dan is dat vragen om moeilijkheden en zware verliezen ipv winsten. Het is nogal wildwest en de gevestigde ‘beleggingsadviseurs’ kunt u beter niet vertrouwen
7433 2018-01-25 13:39:35 And if you keep calling it BTC core, your going to brand yourself as a Bitcoin Cash fan and alienate a lot of viewers who don't like scammers.

7450 2018-01-25 13:37:25 If I was in charge of airdropping @bitcoinprivate, I would not airdrop on Bitcoin Core cuz they already clearly stated they don't believe in any other crypto. Why give a token to someone that does not believe in it or want it? and have nothing but negative things to say about it?

7474 2018-01-25 13:34:10 Maybe I don’t know enough about it but I feel like this whole bitcoin/crypto currency wave is all Bullshit. Just give me cash and I’ll invest that in property and land or something

7476 2018-01-25 13:33:59 true, its hard. if you compare other forks you always see a huge drop in the beginning as mentioned. so i will believe this will happen again.

7491 2018-01-25 13:31:51 You make an interesting point Nick. IMO crypto is meant to reduce the accountants and lawyers, bringing the power to the people! That's why I like nodes and coins that give owners a vote #decentralized

7513 2018-01-25 13:30:16 crypto might only get mass market diffusion w an external catalyst. Something like a financial crisis, extreme deflation/inflation, general loss in traditional currency due to X. Current system *might* be structurally flawed but mass market doesn't care because it works

2. Buy ICOs: $zil, $confi, $bluz, $dadi, $fota, $matrix, $zeepin, $kairo, $wan

7690 2018-01-25 13:13:51 That’s because there’s logic, education and sense behind the Crypto crowd. It’s not driven by a reality TV clown  (isn’t it amazing that the clown actually looks a bit like him?!)

7693 2018-01-25 13:13:30 Is that a great accumulation or what! 
7694 2018-01-25 13:13:22 @IamNomad argument is that this could be USD wired into BFX from customers seeking to buy crypto - then it's converted into USDT so that the investors can send the cash easily to other exchanges that support USDT.

7696 2018-01-25 13:13:18 But it’s just not micro center at this point. Most retailers are selling GPUs at ridiculous prices. Crypto miners are the real issue at this point.
7697 2018-01-25 13:13:13 @MediChainOnline  nice crypto..
7698 2018-01-25 13:13:12 Something I really don't like in crypto right now is that effort is so diluted, it is inefficient.  And I'm not even talking about countless forks ( here is some (Ethereum / EOS / Cardano) + (Ultimate / Gold / Platinum / Cash) )

7703 2018-01-25 13:12:36 Why do "poor Americans" allow the wealthy to force them into paying a "WAR TAX"???  It doesn't make any sense especially if you follow any religion that condemn such actions.  They used to call Americans Brave
7704 2018-01-25 13:12:23 No...
7705 2018-01-25 13:12:22 Isn't bitcoin the one bringing attention and dumb money to altcoins though?
Once you break your resistance in investing in bitcoin, any other crypto is just one step away. Isn't the same behavior Jordan Belfort explored to make money on penny stocks?

7712 2018-01-25 13:12:12 CND - The accuracy for their predictions and indicators are accurate. The product exists and works fantastically, unlike 95% of current crypto companies. A few hedge funds and banks are considering buying the top package.  Limited supply of useful utility tokens.

7717 2018-01-25 13:11:55 I've always been a PC gamer and a hardware enthusiast, so I started out with mining, but left it when I got into trading cuz it was way more profitable & fun. Will probably build a mining farm once the prices of comp HW stabilize.

7732 2018-01-25 13:10:50 They can get married and stay far away from REAL Blockchains....   Ripple is the antithesis of crypto philosophy..   And Banksters are the antithesis of fair and equal money philosophy.
7733 2018-01-25 13:10:45 The message is mostly correct but... on the second thought... does crypto space take anything seriously?
7734 2018-01-25 13:10:41 Graphs don’t predict emotions. The graphs you sent are utter nonsense. Do my a favour and subscribe to @DougPolkPoker he’s great at talking about crypto and you will learn a lot.

7738 2018-01-25 13:09:51 Crypto currencies are an insane financial revolution disguised as a money laundering, get-rich scam.

7743 2018-01-25 13:09:09 Respectfully disagree. I’m not getting near this or any other current crypto-currency. Anyone who plays with it is gambling, and that’s fine, as long as you don’t kid yourself into calling it an investment. Crucially, don’t put money into it you can’t afford to lose. Godspeed.

7835 2018-01-25 12:59:44 #bitcoin and #crypto market progression summed up:

Weak hands panic sell pushing price down. 

HODLers do not, accumulating more. 

When the inevitable rebound happens, only players left are HODLers. And they’re not selling! 

This causes huge bullish rallies.

7843 2018-01-25 12:58:38 I started on a laptop with a gtx 1060 and adventually got enough for a gtx 1070ti, 2 RX 570s, and a 1080ti. I would say mining is definitely the best plan if you plan on getting into cryptocurrency.
7844 2018-01-25 12:58:29 Interesting... if cash doesn’t do the same, it would be a bit odd :) we’ve just gotten used to certain things in the past decades, when it comes to money, and now we think they’re the “right” thing :) KYC and AML are now being baked into many crypto-related projects though...

7853 2018-01-25 12:57:13 en fait je vois pas pourquoi une taxe supplémentaire devrait être appliquée sur ce genre de gains, les cryptos sont considérées pour la plupart comme des devises, certes "crypto"-devises mais elles en ont les caractéristiques, au même titre qu'un dollar ou un yen

7858 2018-01-25 12:56:39 Wow! This is really picking up now. More and more people are trying their hands at #Atomicswaps. People are taking back control of their crypto and trading p2p. The $Kmd team changed crypto and left their mark for ever.
7859 2018-01-25 12:56:21 it's a data collection protocol. AI research and data collection is VERY expensive. Since AI is already present i.e google home, amazon alexa, it will be HUGE. what @bottos_ai is trying to do is make that DATA cheaper and more accessible  to the interested.

7863 2018-01-25 12:56:07 I have been following your tweets for a while. Insightful, but considering the White paper of Satoshi, the current Bitcoin is not fulfilling the objective. Your thoughts on #bitcoin and not #blockchain. Also why you always refer #crypto and not #blockchain?
7864 2018-01-25 12:56:04 かきぴーちゃんじゃなかったのか・・・・。

7872 2018-01-25 12:55:23 Mining is a far better long term plan because you don't actually suffer nearly as much from crashes. If one currency crashes you can always start mining another that's going well. With just buying the coins out right yoh don't get that option.

7887 2018-01-25 12:54:23 Because many/most people in crypto of late are lambs to the slaughter for out-and-out scams like Bitconnect & Tether  and ‘some’ regulation is not a bad thing. If crypto is to go mainstream it needs laws/regulations/legislation to be on friendly terms with it. No exceptions.

7970 2018-01-25 12:44:59 Sort of yes but not really as Moore's Law should be able to maintain pace with a normal block chain ledger for most practical purposes. It's the proof of work concept in crypto currencies that limit supply that saps up all the computational capacity and thus drives energy usage.

7974 2018-01-25 12:44:30 Crypto currency investing is not for everyone.
For people not well versed in it who are interested, they could also support you while they do the research and learn about it. I highly recommend learning about crypto first, before putting hard earned money into it.

7988 2018-01-25 12:43:28 Im new to crypto, but i think keeping both would be the wise thing to do. I  have them also. I keep x amount always in the big 3 ,then make any other investments with whatever i have extra or spare money i have.
7989 2018-01-25 12:43:27 New into crypto and have limited disposable income? Do your research and invest into as many coins as your DI allows. There is no time like the present. Two friends, late in, invested in ETH after months of waiting for ETH to drop, but didn't, so jumped in at $689. Good call?

I focus on the chart & their aggression to sign up clients..

Between $XRP and $XLM it would be fair to say they have landed higher potential $$$ calibre clients than 80% of crypto combined

8123 2018-01-25 12:29:10 Here's a thought:

Crypto 'hodlers' hold on the blind belief that it will become main stream, thus no need ever to encash.

BUT to become main stream two main important factors are required:

Price stability and liquidity

Both which are stifled by the 'hodlers' actions
8124 2018-01-25 12:29:03 #Bitcoin Chart shows that it is on a downtrend & also based on the candlesticks I see a while ago.

8229 2018-01-25 12:14:37 I think that adoption of new technology has in part to do with the amount of risk associated with using the tech. when the risk in using the old tech increases, the risk in using the new technology is perceived as decreasing.

8233 2018-01-25 12:13:58 My take is this is what is making crypto horrible. How can we go on to spread the word of cryptocurrency to new people when we have exchanges closing their doors or delayed verifications to new users. It's a shame to expect digital currency to explode with this background.

8242 2018-01-25 12:13:30 It's really not going anywhere Perry.
Learning crypto is hard itself to understand and then learning to convert and collect... That's a whole other learning curve that people won't give a fuck about
8243 2018-01-25 12:13:15 To maximize opportunity in the crypto market, it is beneficial to have a smaller portion of your portfolio available to trade when needed. An example: 85% long term hold, 15% for short term trades. Adjust that ratio according to your experience and comfort.#blockchain #trading

8249 2018-01-25 12:12:48 Crypto currencies besides not being properly backed anymore than casino chips, are stupidly risky, flooding the market, again where they're appearing from, no monitoring again, but ultimately as skirting tax system, government finances will start collapsing
8250 2018-01-25 12:12:46 Hadn’t expected such a low „yes“ result. I think if you are in crypto, you should have tried it at least once to mine some coins

8268 2018-01-25 12:10:28 I hope you're right, but the 6-HR long term view of BTC shows we still have a ways to go down. Personally, I think we need one more good BTC dip to get the market back on track to move to new highs.

The people who majority uses it doesn't use the internet like us nor care to look into it other options.

It ain't gonna happen
8314 2018-01-25 12:04:21 I was misinformed regarding their white paper stating that.  My apologies.  I should've fact checked or chosen my words more carefully to avoid spreading nonsense.

8316 2018-01-25 12:03:50 i get what you're saying. But remember that most investors (newbs in crypto) just follow the hype and move more volatile. I trade what i see and think it might be possible that Ven will correct. Believe me that i do believe fully it belongs in top10 projects and will be soon'ish

8395 2018-01-25 11:54:24 Pio, you have great reasons to be excited about Vechain! I have already tripled my money. But Vechain is not a short play. Vechain is a monster crypto, and I for one will be holding on for what I like to call "The Great Harvest"

8429 2018-01-25 11:50:14 Find a volatile crypto. Trade it for the accumulation of dollars. You could do it with Bitcoin... but there's better leverage to find in some alts. Or you could just sit in some US dollars.

8432 2018-01-25 11:50:00 Prima als ze het over #bitcoin hebben. Het 'reguleren' van bitcoin is echter onmogelijk. Zonder dat je het internet afsluit kun je crypto's niet reguleren. Het is moderne ruilhandel en dat kan niet gereguleerd worden.

8440 2018-01-25 11:49:09 May not be OK for swing or short term trading due to high unpredictable volatility state of crypto market now and it could easily slide down in few days but if Long term could be better

8442 2018-01-25 11:48:55 I haven't. Not sure what you mean by "remaining token issuance could be one (if capped)". Style premia needs big liquid markets, and I don't think crypto has enough market cap or daily volume yet.

8548 2018-01-25 11:34:24 The claims are fabricated. I’ve heard the same claims since my undergrad days in the 1980s. It was fake then. And it’s fake now.
8549 2018-01-25 11:34:24 Crypto zone very happy
8550 2018-01-25 11:34:21 i have been getting a lot of news that $wan will be $11 dollars on day. 
Why wouold anyone who has them, sell for less when it hits exchange?

8552 2018-01-25 11:34:06 Noob here :) Any advice for those of us that have the opposite problem?? I want to be in everything that checks out according to fa. Not enough money made on crypto yet to be able to do so :(
8553 2018-01-25 11:34:04 なるほど、そういうことだったんですね〜
価格変更お願いします
8554 2018-01-25 11:34:01 @CRYPTO_ALTMK
8555 2018-01-25 11:33:38 Its marketing company. They are just starting w #crypto. Next ratings will be even more controversial. Pay-for-grade + inside trading will be applied nicely similarly as #mcaffee s - coin of the day! This market attracted and will attract lots of different levels scammers
8556 2018-01-25 11:33:37 Is there any people who have wallets on Freewallet Exchange ?
If yes, get out from there !!!
Try Binance, or Bittrex, but forget about this shitty exchange platform !

I never saw a service with so much issues !
8557 2018-01-25 11:33:30 Lite coin does this too, so I guess Lite coin is bitcoin. I'm sure we can find a bunch of other coins that also do this.

 I would use Bch if not for the shilling. Shitty "marketing" is driving users away and @rogerkver doesn't get it. If you would just shut up, more would use it
8558 2018-01-25 11:33:18 No not yet. Working on the leasing tool which is planned to release end of Q1 this year

8578 2018-01-25 11:31:12 Switzerland seems to ignore mismanagments in the Crypto foundations. Example is #Tezos where @johanngevers stalling the project for months by mismanaging the biggest ICO. #Cryptovalley is being called #Kleptovalley. Be careful running you foundation in Switzerland.

8639 2018-01-25 11:24:45 1. I really dislike the assumption that people who are critical of crypto-currencies are somehow necessarily ignorant of how they work.

My boner will have to suffice.
8662 2018-01-25 11:21:26 draw a line from pre natal breakout prices of around 7k to now, and all you see is natural growth, we are either oversold or just at the right price right now. I'm bullish, but then, why would I be anything else with the best deflationary currency around the block? :D
8663 2018-01-25 11:21:02 Very embarrassing to release such poorly researched information considering each crypto is very well documented
8664 2018-01-25 11:20:58 So far, I think Bithumb is the only exch. that has been victim of data hack.

8687 2018-01-25 11:16:56 Get rid of all subsidies. Let the different alternatives fight it out on the free market. Until then, I really don’t care, because there won’t be improvement. I’d rather subsidize profitable oil companies over failed socialist pet projects in “green jobs” if I had to choose.

8837 2018-01-25 10:59:52 Fair enough, though the fork being priced into the falling price seems odd. Then again trying to apply normal investment fundamentals and behavior to Crypto seems to constantly surprise me  let’s hope we see an increase in the volume soon. Sideways movement is frustrating

8893 2018-01-25 10:52:41 What you're missing is the relationship between fiat net inflows and market cap. Often around 50:1. Market cap is almost worthless as a stat for crypto.

8900 2018-01-25 10:51:29 For crypto investments the devil is in the detail. The technical details and usecase details - report was lacking.

8905 2018-01-25 10:50:30 Could not agree more. This is not something to be proud of, and only paints an even worse picture of bitcoin/crypto than the other side already had. This only hurts the movement in just about everyone’s eyes.

8907 2018-01-25 10:50:13 Great article. It surprises me how lots of companies get so much support in the crypto space without any particular use case.
8908 2018-01-25 10:50:06 Another terrible article. Ripple XRP doesn't claim to be anything like Bitcoin and banks are already piloting the technology with mass adoption to come soon. Please stop spreading FUD.

8917 2018-01-25 10:48:30 Find someone who wants to buy it with Crypto. 
8918 2018-01-25 10:48:19 These mainstream analysts need to get their act together! They will find that a significant amount of crypto investors is rather well informed. I don't think @WeissRatings will gain much authority in the crypto space.
8919 2018-01-25 10:48:08 Governments are repressing #crypto because they want to maintain their control over their own fiat monies. They are taking measures to block the utilization and mining of crypto; however, these measures have a limited effect: miners are finding ways to circumvent regulations

8941 2018-01-25 10:43:09 Paying in #Bitcoin or other 'crypto currency' would very likely subject the employer (i.e. clubs) to Fringe Benefits Tax (#FBT) at a very high rate (currently 47%).

8968 2018-01-25 10:39:36 Crypto is a big theme here at Davos.There are an estimated 35 million computers generating the world's cryptocurrencies. That requires as much energy as a country the size of Denmark. #WEF18
8969 2018-01-25 10:39:34 total bullshit.. the rich gained a dramatically worse monopoly of data and knowledge with the internet
8970 2018-01-25 10:39:23 Le problème c'est que les autres crypto monnaies dépendent bien trop du BTC, il faudrait une réelle alternative pour briser ce monopole, à voir dans les mois/années à suivre j'ai envie de dire.
8971 2018-01-25 10:39:23 Sheikh, could you explain why investing in crypto currency is Haram?. Is it not the same as buying a piece of land for example and waiting for it to gain value to sell?
8972 2018-01-25 10:39:10 BTCが値上がりしていくとき，どの形の投資が有利か：
1. 入金，出金ともビットコイン（TCCなど）
2. 入金，出金ともドル計算（D9, winnex+など）
3. 入金はドル，出金はビットコイン（BitClubなど）

後ほど始めやすい：2,3
後ほど出金$が大きい：1,3

8980 2018-01-25 10:37:29 How much of our position did you take out when it hit the ATH?
8981 2018-01-25 10:37:28 I honestly think crypto-boosters are too blinded by their own rhetoric to see the red flags the SEC is waving under their noses. The only thing that will make them take notice at this point is an actual prosecution.
8982 2018-01-25 10:37:27 Thx sir !
8983 2018-01-25 10:37:09 So much fake news out there regarding crypto. What can you do? Choose wisely who to trust.

8988 2018-01-25 10:36:34 You clearly are lost.. nobody is buying BCC . Anyone who hasn’t made their money back x2 needs to stop with crypto. BCC volatility has given its holders plenty of chances to make their money back. And I shall continue to buy. Let it hit 5usd I’ll invest another 50k.

The country is thriving with such positivity there. What a change it was returning to the UK, such a feeling of decline

9052 2018-01-25 10:26:58 I truly don't know how to answer that. No one ever taught me how to trade crypto. I didn't know what "TA" was until maybe 2 months ago. I understand it, I'm sure I incorporate it into my trading, but I incorporate everything into my trading - most importantly my gut feeling.

You scope out a solid choice and jump in.
sometimes it goes well.
Other times you see the lines all around moving faster, the regret sinks in...you get fomo, bail,  jump in other line then your old line

9123 2018-01-25 10:17:06 Japan - in debt to the hilt for years and crypto is the only way out.
9124 2018-01-25 10:16:58 Glad to hear of the good start! As long as it's gone sideways short term and not backwards, it can't be too bad... I'm trying to stay away from Crypto tbh apart from the odd trade on BTC. The 24 hour thing scares me, could ruin many a life!

9271 2018-01-25 09:55:11 #CryptoPhilosophy 3:

A crypto network is "peer-to-peer" and transactions take place between users directly, without an intermediary. 

Each transaction is verified by network nodes (or peers). This means that each node helps the other.

Stay tuned.

9276 2018-01-25 09:55:03 FAQ: Do You Accept Bitcoin As Payment?
A: Unfortunately Bitcoin is too volatile for us to accept as a payment method at this point in time, although we are open to accepting crypto-currencies in the future. We currently accept credit card, bank deposit, PayPal, and AfterPay

9286 2018-01-25 09:53:52 No my view isn’t that.

My view is that you don’t need to know crypto to trust that it’s unbreakable. With that knowledge, you can read white paper and *know* that there’s no possibility of someone doing other than what the white paper says.

9307 2018-01-25 09:50:48 Crypto was philosophically meant to free the world's disenfranchised from the shackles of war backed Fiat. How do we prevent the old money 1% from controlling the people's money?
9308 2018-01-25 09:50:40 If "millions will be worth nothing" then the U.S. would be under hyperinflation, facing a similar crises as Venezuela today, & the 25 years of expenses should just be "1M euros of stocks" or "100M Yen of stocks", or "25 years of expenses as crypto appreciating at 6%/year"

9316 2018-01-25 09:50:11 You don’t have to understand crypto to know how bananacoin will be linked.

If in their white paper they don’t mention that, anyone can read and decide that. I’m saying you can trust crypto to work without knowing how it works.

9408 2018-01-25 09:38:41 The whole point is not to cash out of crypto more than you need to survive. Someday nobody wants fiat anymore.
9409 2018-01-25 09:38:35 I think it is a bit weird to assume that this is the future. You can not predict what is ging to happen, for that reason you should always protect a part of  your capital. I’m trying to read between the lines and it is saying imo ‘go all in on crypto, fiat is scam’...(no offence)

9425 2018-01-25 09:35:02 How can they rate something that doesn’t exist yet.... it’s basically a speculative rating and that table just shows data in price. Not actual facts about real world usage which is what the rating scale should address !

9571 2018-01-25 09:12:34 Well I think they should continue doing it. There most be a way. I think this is the root of the problem. This is partially why iota was so badly rated in the new crypto ranking. Making them to do an statement would make more effect than fighting thousand of troll Twitters.

9625 2018-01-25 09:06:07 Davos: Blockchain dominated on the periphery. WEF/old world" were displaying horses and the "Crypto community" demonstrated the Model T. The "xanaxization" period of Crypto starts today. BTC will confuse them but we are CALM and will build the technology and create new value.
9626 2018-01-25 09:06:05 I always wondered how much fiat(real money) is actually worth the crypto market. The total market cap doesn't really mean that it can be exchanged in the same amount of fiat. The total market cap is influenced by how much the communities are devoted to technology, by HODL.

9689 2018-01-25 08:58:27 Why should it be huge ? 
It has the same probability such as many other altcoin. And just 20 / 30 crypto will survive.

9722 2018-01-25 08:53:07 Same thing!!! Still shit!! You tell me why they don’t give you back in BTC? After all that’s what these “bots” are using to trade with. Seems awfully long that a company will cash your BTC after trading with it?

9794 2018-01-25 08:41:28 They did give a reason the 75% reserve is for the marketplace as I have said.

It's not binary you know. It's not central banking or decentralised crypto. Both will most likely coexist for a very long time.
9811 2018-01-25 08:38:54 Exactly. It's a liability until you paid it off.

9818 2018-01-25 08:38:04 Yes, everyone ends up paying the same. But bonuses expiring in the first hour will force people to buy before they are comfortable with the valuation. Not sure what's your point for token supply. $gems gave no reason why they need 75%.  As cap decreases so does that 75% increase.

9821 2018-01-25 08:37:10 I feel so “out of the loop” what is crypto currency
9822 2018-01-25 08:37:07 They are called bots..
9823 2018-01-25 08:36:55 deposit your money on coinome.
move it to koinex through ltc which is priced higher on koinex so u will also make a profit in the way.
then u can buy ripple on koinex.
crypto transactions are working fine on koinex.

9839 2018-01-25 08:35:00 Like @Ripple really need coinbase or they fold 
9840 2018-01-25 08:34:59 The hard cap constantly decreases over time, and everyone ends up paying the same excluding bonuses. The token supply is due to the high number required for the @gems marketplace, and will not be dumped on the exchanges.

どうやって鍛錬するかって？そりゃあんた・・・え～と・・・どうやるの？ｗ

9978 2018-01-25 08:18:02 That’s what crypto currency is for.
9979 2018-01-25 08:17:59 Bitcoin could kill Coins Market if you and Crypto Exchanges anchor price of altcoins (as ETH, Stellar, Ripple, Zcash, Monero...) on BTC though as: ETH/BTC; XLM/BTC, Zcash/BTC because Bitcoin's price is going to down and make Altcoins's down. That is very bad for crypto market.

9985 2018-01-25 08:17:21 The thing is that no matter what news come up, tha price will surge only when the whales decide to do it..
Sad but true, this is a very young and low liquidity market and can be easily manipulated.
Institutional whales can even move the FX market, crypto is just a tiny dot..
9986 2018-01-25 08:17:21 Don't be impatient with your #Crypto portfolio.
All those guys making a lot of $$$ on here aren't living life (Money owns them).

The true richness is happening when you have a lot of love in your heart account.
Then, you own money but money doesn't own you.

Free(love) yourself.
