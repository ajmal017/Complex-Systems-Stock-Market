143 2018-05-28 23:34:08 gun lovers say bump stocks are pointless, that they can convert their guns to automatic without bump stocks. so... why wouldn’t they support banning bump stocks? I don’t get it. if you can convert your rifle without a bump stock, why tf do you care about banning bump stocks?
144 2018-05-28 23:34:01 “What bump stocks” said the entire state of New Jersey.
145 2018-05-28 23:33:49 Bump stocks on semi-automatic rifles, right...

You wouldn't put a bumpstock on an automatic rifle.

164 2018-05-28 23:28:43 Remember after the Parkland shootings, Trump promised to raise the minimum age requirement to purchase a firearm from 18 to 21.  He also promised to ban bump-stocks. 

NEITHER HAS HAPPENED!

The NRA controls Trump!

TRUMP IS A WEAK, COWARDLY, OLD MAN!
165 2018-05-28 23:28:41 I don’t need a bump stock. Nobody needs a bump stock. It’s that if you give an inch the gun grabbers want a mile. Nobody believes it stops at bump stocks. Then it’s AR-15s, then it’s shotguns, then it’s something else.

He dodged the draft, and now he's dodging America.

226 2018-05-28 23:14:26 The ATF is refusing to allow an amnesty period for bumpfire stocks under their proposal to reclassify them as machine guns under the NFA34. Which is a scary proposal - since bumpstocks do not meet the legal requirements to be classified as machine guns under NFA34.

265 2018-05-28 23:08:06 Easy there Kyle. Going past his constitutional authority is what he does best so that’s never a good argument.And bump stocks are not a constitutional right. It would be a tiny baby step in pretending anyone in the GOP cares about avoiding mass shootings.
266 2018-05-28 23:07:33 Total, how many do you need? Yes pls ban bump stocks.

Why must your side constantly lie when voicing your arguments? But for lies, the Dem party wouldn't exist! #2A #NRA
271 2018-05-28 23:06:20 The president of the United States doesn't have any authority to ban bump stocks.

276 2018-05-28 23:05:11 Speaking of Dems being "gentle and kind" to MS-13 (which is another ludicrous lie), how about explaining why you've continued to be gentle and kind to @NRA after promising to ban bump stocks and raise purchasing age to 21? Another false promise by the king of lies.
277 2018-05-28 23:05:06 Ban bump stocks! There is absolutely no good reason not to!  Let's go!

279 2018-05-28 23:04:51 Assuming you support this young mans  decision....youthful ignorance is fine and I am sure that his intentions are good...not sure about your thoughts on this...are you in favor of stricter gun control outside of the standard “ban bump stocks”...AR’s...etc...

320 2018-05-28 22:58:08 Bump stocks should be banned, but tweeting this won’t make much of a difference. 
We need to register and vote. 
We need new representatives in office who will pass the laws banning bump stocks. #BanBumpStocks
321 2018-05-28 22:57:54 Do you understand how government works? Trump has also just been president for 16 months. what did Obama do for gun control in 8 years?  Trump has already said he wants to ban bump stocks but he doesn't write or pass laws... only Congress can do that.

348 2018-05-28 22:54:35 Hi Kyle, did President Trump say he wanted the minimum age of ownership for firearms to be 21, and did he also say that that he would ban bump stocks (or words to the same effect in both cases)? Cos if he did (and he did) and he has done neither, then he lied!
349 2018-05-28 22:54:26 @realDonaldTrump Remember after the Parkland shootings, Trump promised to raise the minimum age requirement to purchase a firearm from 18 to 21.  He also promised to ban bump-stocks. 

NEITHER HAS HAPPENED!

The NRA controls Trump!

"Currency and commodity markets tend to be much more cyclical than the stock market, which trends higher with earnings."

This means that TIME cycles are more important for currencies and commodities. Fundamentals are more important for stocks

506 2018-05-28 22:26:32 You need to watch other news chs, he immediately told Sessions to stop the sale of the Obama bump stocks, under 21 for most guns is already a law. He's strengthening the background checks, he's actually enforcing the laws already on the books! We have a ppl proplem, murderers.
507 2018-05-28 22:26:31 agree about bump-stocks, But Not increasing age 2 buy guns...legal age sld b the same 4 all. At 18 a per can sign a contract, decide medical care, marry, tried/punished as an adult, vote & join military...if draft starts can b drafted. Can't buy alcohol until 21.

Trump is too busy making up conspiracy theories about his campaign--even though the only spies on his campaign were the ones DonJr & others met with.
535 2018-05-28 22:21:27 David, bump stocks are banned thanks to Sessions.

547 2018-05-28 22:20:03 Oh that explains it! Trump has no clue how our government works! If he did he wouldn’t make stupid statements like bump stocks done! The ONLY THING that idiot is capable of doing is conning people! But keep telling yourself he’s doing all he can

555 2018-05-28 22:19:41 Society isn’t going to collapse you paranoid idiot. Typical coward, scared of his own shadow so he stocks up on guns and a healthy dose of authoritarianism. How can you idiots spout off about freedom one moment and then demand unquestioned compliance the next moment?

559 2018-05-28 22:19:07 So your saying he could, but has chosen not to. I honestly don't think it would upset his base if he did so. At least it shouldn't. Bump Stocks turn the gun into an illegal weapon. It's that simple. Attack me if you must but I'm pro 2nd. Just how I see it.

564 2018-05-28 22:18:53 Thanks, but it's not a "happy" day. 

Here's a thought: give yourself something to brag about and fulfill your own promise to ban bump stocks and raise the gun purchase age to 21. 

Even Democrats will cheer you for that. Win-win!

580 2018-05-28 22:17:04 He did ban bump stocks ffs and inorder to Raise the the age limit to 21 he would have to first raise the age limit to be able to join the military and I am not as smart as you  but I would think a executive order wouldn't do the trick.
581 2018-05-28 22:16:55 Your hero Obama is the one who approved sales of Bump Stocks so blame him for this happening to begin with

590 2018-05-28 22:16:12 You are absolutely wrong about how to improve the way stocks are accounted for, and right that the system could be improved. You can't formulate a correct solution because you don't understand the tools you're trying to apply to the problem.

603 2018-05-28 22:14:21 Let's see, mayB Bcause bump-stocks R not used in 99.9 % of mass shootings.  The only 1 it was used in was the Vegas shooting.  More people die in car accidents every yr than guns with bump-stocks & guns in general. How about we ban cars & hammers as they kill a lot of people 2.
604 2018-05-28 22:14:15 Let the wealth transfer of alt coin trading shake out, let a few good projects prevail. Looked upon as new company stocks as a digitalized asset. Then let the trashcoins money come piling back into Bitcoin, for good.

625 2018-05-28 22:12:24 None of that is because bump stocks are legal. And it’s also not the job of potus to pass laws. 

Banning bump stocks would just be feel good legislation that helps nothing and only serves as another infringement.

680 2018-05-28 22:06:16 Stocks (or stacks, as you like to call them) have nothing to do with tax cuts. Unless you’re talking capital gains but I’ll just leave this here.

682 2018-05-28 22:06:14 Hey dotard, why didn't you ban bump stocks and raise the firearm purchase age to 21  like you said you would? Oh, because you're a lying pus sack.
683 2018-05-28 22:06:13 Because bump stocks have been used ONCE EVER for crime, and age restrictions wouldn't stop school shooters because they tend to be under 21 and use someone else's gun.

707 2018-05-28 22:03:19 Bump stocks were used to kill Trump supporters. You should be estatic.
708 2018-05-28 22:02:41 Even if he could I would like to know how many shooting involved bump stocks in the last 10 years. I dont condone them but I'm just wondering...would it really make that much of a difference?
709 2018-05-28 22:02:12 Don’t usually take the time to post about stocks in a less than positive light, but $LRDR boards are sounding VERY pumpy. Longs trying to sell? “Millionaire investing next week” - “we will be Blockchain” - “we passed AXMP and are next in line” - appreciate DD on all of this
710 2018-05-28 22:02:01 We should all tweet ”Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?” on every @realDonaldTrump tweet from now on
711 2018-05-28 22:01:58 A hole. Who ran out on the promises you made to Parkland about banning assault weapons, bump stocks and raising age of gun purchases? NRA HAS YOU BY THE BALLS.
712 2018-05-28 22:01:41 Buy on every dip... till crude is falling, airline stocks will keep rising.
713 2018-05-28 22:01:38 Because bump stocks and young firearms owners aren’t a problem.
714 2018-05-28 21:57:39 Bump stocks are not a constitional right. They should be banned.
715 2018-05-28 21:57:18 I’m waiting for @realDonaldTrump to keep his promises ! It’s been over three months and he hasn’t taken any action on banning bump stocks and raising the age to purchase firearm to 21.

Replacement for savings a/c to FDs to Bonds to Stocks to Int'l stocks to Gold

However MFs are good to buy right now because they are doing well is a wrong reason to invest
721 2018-05-28 21:52:58 I cxld and deleted Netflix right away. And I enjoyed filling in the "other" reason. Wonder how fast their stocks and members plummet
722 2018-05-28 21:52:07 Sure, but I wasn’t talking about transportation or homemade explosives or knives or any other weaponry or modes of transportation. I was mentioning bump stocks. If you want to convince me that bump stocks shouldn’t be banned, I’m gonna need a better reason than this.

728 2018-05-28 21:47:33 "what do people in this space feel about this kind of market maturing", I think it will still take years/decades, BTC is the most mature market so far, it has similar liquidity to large stocks like AAPL, ETH and XRP are secondary, coins like NEO, STRAT, ETC third tier, and so on.
729 2018-05-28 21:45:36 Where is it documented that the NRA supports defunding the ATF? The NRA supports responsible use and safety for those exercising their 2A constitutional rights.  NRA even asked ATF to ban bump stocks after LasVegas shooting
730 2018-05-28 21:43:49 Ban the bump stocks! I stand with David and all the brave young people who are in the direct line of fire in our American schools. It is callous to want anything less.
731 2018-05-28 21:43:47 Damn man!  You continue to rock the stocks!

741 2018-05-28 21:33:42 I´m honestly considering buying some stocks here in Brazil... I mean, everythink sank so much that who know, I might make a few bucks. Too bad I don´t have much I can afford to invest hahaha. Also, probably bad idea...
742 2018-05-28 21:33:23 Fantastic news for our salmon stocks here in Scotland as well. Well done to everyone involved
743 2018-05-28 21:30:12 Google a USA Today article "DOJ proposes new ban ln bump stocks that mimic machine guns." President Trump is not a dictator. So he can't just make a law by himself. That is Congress's job. You can't blame the President on how slow it takes.
744 2018-05-28 21:29:03 Bitcoin went up when the Fang stocks went up.  Gold did the opposite.  Bezos& Zuckerberg have recently both sold a billion dollars of their respective stocks!
745 2018-05-28 21:28:50 Yeah good for them but NNT mentions something about this in the black swan. Just a dumb thing to do because making money off stocks has nothing to do with skill and everything to do with randomness but people use success in the market to inflate their egos nonetheless.
746 2018-05-28 21:27:53 Now about the " Super Moon Yellow". How is the stocks looking like?
747 2018-05-28 21:27:48 After my #PremierOil sell last week am hoping to release a third update on the 6 UK energy stocks I have covered lately.Sadly am bearish as all signs are there for a retrace in #Shell ,#BP, #Brent #TullowOil #CairnEnergy etc #oil to retrace further IMO. Long term I remain bullish
748 2018-05-28 21:27:23 perchè l'ha fatto? pur sapendo che così, tra qualche mese, si ritroverà di fronte una maggioranza costituzionale che farà quel che gli pare?

756 2018-05-28 21:19:52 Coming back from what?  We had 8 years of a highly respected President, other countries liked us, unemployment was down, stocks were up, crime was down...and Obama's hands were tied through much of that time.  We are down the toilet now.
757 2018-05-28 21:19:37 Which stocks will perform the worst when we finally take down Trump for his crimes?
758 2018-05-28 21:15:47 most, if not all, wealth/asset manager or financial advisor would tell u to DIVERSIFY investment portfolio - stocks, bonds, mutual fund, all kinds etf, real estate, etc etc. BUT that is DEAD WRONG strategy. no one is GOD. no one capable of tracking all these. FOCUS is KEY.

772 2018-05-28 21:07:17 I'm not really defending bump-stocks but tell me how many shootings had bump-stocks used in the past 10 years. Is that really the problem? Or is it the fact that we have kids being raised wrong? Or maybe a bullying problem? How come the midwest doesn't have near as many shootings

795 2018-05-28 20:53:05 Jim - Didn't even budge the stocks today. You're bang on. It reduces dilution risk in the short run and increases the overall cash flow potential of these assets. Also, plays a role in other states such as New York. This is a unique opportunity for retail investors.
796 2018-05-28 20:52:55 It is what this post is about because he said his Bundle of Stocks will become SoV+MoE+UoA and will make Bitcoin unneccessary. Read some of Qiao’s other posts.

799 2018-05-28 20:48:01 A key or a piece of paper can’t recognize an asset either - but the laws of humans can say that this piece of a Bitcoin or other token will be a legal share just as a paper bearer share— these laws are an intertwined part of stocks and capital markets - this would improve it imho

801 2018-05-28 20:45:31 Retired sets do better than stocks. I have made a ton off Lego. A set for sale still in the shop would obviously be retail price. And I assume your daughter opened them. Yeah were not talking about the same thing.
802 2018-05-28 20:45:05 I entirely respect your opinion, however at the very least they help give context & identify extremes of sentiment. They were good enough for Anthony Bolton of Fidelity when I worked with him on AIM & SmallCap stocks & all hedge fund managers I know use charts

832 2018-05-28 20:16:35 You may be right. We'll see. I suppose we agree that a recession is coming. I see signs everywhere, from bubble stocks to high RE prices to student loans, etc.

836 2018-05-28 20:15:15 50'000 stock x 25R$ = 1'250'000 R$ for the whole stock! Lets compare this to sparkletime valk which total stocks price is 25'000'000R$ (never forgetti sparkletime valk)
837 2018-05-28 20:13:28 yeah because before stocks loaded there is 0 stock; sold out
838 2018-05-28 20:13:05 Very good article. I like TC2000, I used it extensively when I was trading for a hedge fund to scan and identify by base universe of stocks to apply my quant methods. The price database was fairly clean and continuously adjusted for splits and dividends.

848 2018-05-28 20:05:23 I am an ignorant guy tweeting to every Canadian politician "END OVERSEAS TAX AVOIDANCE NOW!" After I read your article I am a little less ignorant.   What about a tax on trading stocks (Robin Hood tax) on stocks like they have in the UK?
849 2018-05-28 20:04:32 I wondered for a second why Micro Center never stocks any Acer laptops, but then I realized if they did, there would be no contest and Acer’s competitors would quickly lose market share. Either that or Acer would go out of business if they can’t keep up with QA and demand.

The fact that more than 40% of Americans have difficult covering basic expenses means that they likely won't be able to invest even if "smart."

893 2018-05-28 19:37:01 Bump stocks are a product of a dangerous sub culture. They are unacceptable to the vast majority of Americans and cannot be rationally justified within the parameters of the U.S. constitution. They should be irrevocably banned from existence.

when i applied it on stocks also they correlating exactly.
Its just that good stocks recover faster, but all they go by is this market cycle.
and having a look at ltc shows bottom will be 75-90$

904 2018-05-28 19:24:26 Tillerson said it best: trump is a fckng moron

& NOT for JOBS or raises)
And he BLAMES others for his many failures

913 2018-05-28 19:17:06 Would be interested to know what your screening process is.  Screening greatly increases the odds of success IMO.  Investors who do badly tend to look at random ideas (tips etc).  An issue with screening, though, is that it is hard comparing stocks in different sectors IMO.
914 2018-05-28 19:15:59 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to treat your chronic fatigue

929 2018-05-28 19:06:39 Biggest thing is how are your stocks acting. Other big thing is getting 4 days removed from a ftd without having distribution, and that gives a rally better odds of surviving and expanding.

942 2018-05-28 18:57:19 Stocks are the place to be. Forex and crypto are not as lucrative or easy to trade

946 2018-05-28 18:52:30 And businesses aren't investing so much as they are buying back stocks. That does nothing for the average person; it only helps shareholders and CEOs. You may be investing, but that would make you a relatively rare bird.
947 2018-05-28 18:52:24 Put em in the stocks!!! #Islandlife
948 2018-05-28 18:49:17 Are we sure that it wasnt the fact that rich people dont go to movie theaters and everyone else ranout of money after black panther came out and then they realised that they dont own any stocks and the real "nuts and bolts" economy is fucked?
949 2018-05-28 18:47:57 Trigger?
Current govt has no trigger left, unless it does game changing events like pro corporate moves, easy taxation..
Another factor is lack of retail participation in F&o from july onwards, due to stopping of leveraging and requirements of full margin in 200+ main stocks
950 2018-05-28 18:47:23 Ban bump stocks
951 2018-05-28 18:46:45 And not to forget the stabilization of yields we ve been talking about should relax pressures to equity multiples ! 

Obviously not talking about EU stocks but US stocks should continue higher, without excluding a revisit back to 2650 for S&P500

953 2018-05-28 18:45:22 AS FAR AS BUMP STOCKS .. potus trump directed DOJ to add bimpstocks to list of banned items like machine guns so BUM STOCKS ARE CONSIDERED AS ARE MACHINE GUNS AND ARE ILLEGAL .. if you're gonna wade into gun debate .,, keep up
954 2018-05-28 18:45:20 Crazy I just said this the other day uncrowded stocks are hidden gems
955 2018-05-28 18:44:47 Personally I think they will. Their capex spend is massive and can always be reduced. Local stocks are all trading badly at the moment so it can go lower but for me its dam good value.
956 2018-05-28 18:44:27 The only reason bump stocks are legal is because of the NRAs un precedented financial grasp on our nations lawmakers.  Take away the power of the special interest. Lobbyists should not have more of a vote that the citizens of this country.

1000 2018-05-28 18:06:02 The biggest thing of investing in stocks is knowing why they are going up or down in value what is causing it so you can then read ahead of time oh this is happening so the stock will be affected in this way,it’s a matter of reading he patterns, I’m learning as I go but start now
1001 2018-05-28 18:05:31 NBD means no big deal, which is the impression I get from your rosy outlook. I appreciate your enthusiasm for salmon farming, but please forgive me if I don't share it, particularly when you seem to suggest endangering stocks/habitat as a means of moderating wild fish populations
1002 2018-05-28 18:05:20 Do ppl not realize that “investment” doesn’t only mean money or stocks

1005 2018-05-28 17:58:48 What does NBD mean?

I agree that too many fish could be a problem for certain stocks, like Chinook.

What I am pointing out is that salmon stocks are extremely plentiful at the moment. The recent record returns show that most populations are healthy.

1036 2018-05-28 17:38:54 To be precise, all assets would be taxed only once, so stocks would be taxed, but could be deducted by corporations as liabilities against the corporate assets.
1037 2018-05-28 17:38:16 If the supermarkets give away large stocks of 'past sell by date' (that are perfectly edible) then presumably they have to increase the cost of 'before sell by date' to allow for that.

1081 2018-05-28 16:59:26 It's all PAAS news.  Mexico situation puts all miners in that region as big ? Now that constant strikes and a break down of law and order is hitting every region.  All Mexico silver stocks impacted on the news today.
1082 2018-05-28 16:58:50 Please ban bump stocks!!
1083 2018-05-28 16:58:28 Trump ordered the ATF to regulate bump stocks. As far as I know, they are going through their rule-making procedure to ban them. Adding a new regulation takes time if they do it legally. (Probably at least a year.)
Trump is not a dictator.
1084 2018-05-28 16:57:21 Are you gonna invest in stocks?
1085 2018-05-28 16:56:15 Ban bump stocks - it’s a no brainer! WA State just did it in our legislature.

1091 2018-05-28 16:50:44 All of the stocks on my watchlist have no volume today. 
1092 2018-05-28 16:50:23 Well, since even @amfiindia doesn't provide for a Survivor Free DB, tough to answer your question. But if picking stocks is bad for business, MF's should be selling only debt not equity funds.
1093 2018-05-28 16:49:56 Congress doesn't need to pass a law to ban bump stocks. The proposed rule on which Giffords org & David are asking people to comment will clarify that bump stock type devices are among the devices called "machine guns" under existing laws.
1094 2018-05-28 16:49:26 Actually, you’re wrong. There are circumstances that happen that make abortion the only option for some women. A woman with a tubular pregnancy, which would kill her, would have to have one, and those situations aren’t ever taken into account. But those bump stocks...? Nope
1095 2018-05-28 16:48:44 No bump stocks!!
1096 2018-05-28 16:48:22 @SeanKyneTD is proposing a Bye-Law that will see our Pike stocks in Ireland decimated. He acts against all scientific studies done on this topic. Irish angling has suffered enough lately. Please RT this. NEVER vote Fine Gael again.

1108 2018-05-28 16:40:44 No #NRA member has ever been a mass shooter! There is a problem that people who shouldn't ever have a gun can access them. Our background check system needs to be fixed. Agree assault weapons and bump stocks should not be available to average person. #NRA needs to agree.

1111 2018-05-28 16:37:13 Yeah! I found some Whiskey Peddlers and the girl got bit by a plague zombie. I had one cure in my stocks and like 7 minutes to make one.

1114 2018-05-28 16:35:53 Have a list of high liquid stocks. Check for IV spike on them, IVR, favourable BEP based on profile charts and select strikes. That's my method. Question for you, do Option prices change on IV or the other way around.
1115 2018-05-28 16:33:09 They can’t. Poaching is a big  reason why stocks are in trouble yet Lib government going to waste coin on a catch/release study .
1116 2018-05-28 16:33:02 Hence it will be simply classed as distinct parent-stocks?

1122 2018-05-28 16:27:11 Stocks also go up when corporations buy back their own stock, which is what most large corporations are doing with the tax cuts implemented in December, instead of investing in their employees. See: Harley Davidson
1123 2018-05-28 16:26:33 In full support of banning bump stocks. It's ridiculous we even need to campaign for such an obvious piece of legislation. It's ridiculous when I have to teach my three children what to do if a shooter arrives on their campus.
1124 2018-05-28 16:25:37 Yeah, I saw that a couple of years ago I think !? Pretty smart. Quick ya`all ! Get the bananas stocks before the price goes bananas !
1125 2018-05-28 16:24:59 People (other than @APompliano) don't talk about tokenization enough and what it means for the avg person. Imagine being able to have a $100 portfolio split btwn NYC real estate, stocks, bonds, and fine art. Everybody gets a better risk profile...no longer limited to the wealthy.
1126 2018-05-28 16:23:51 If by "terrible wrong" you mean low unemployment, record high stocks, freed hostages, and unapologetic foreign policy...

1130 2018-05-28 16:18:24 Trends in the market are apparently more persistent than what one would expect of randomly generated data. The reason may be as simple as continuously increasing investment. Or investor preference for stocks that are rising.
1131 2018-05-28 16:18:00 Let's ban bump stocks!
1132 2018-05-28 16:17:41 BAN BUMP STOCKS NOW!
1133 2018-05-28 16:17:02 And what are the possible reasons that rating agencies and Engine stocks have not performed since the last so many quarters ...think growth is missing and will elude them for another year or so
1134 2018-05-28 16:16:34 Even when stocks aren’t trading you can still see the rotation at work. Smalls, energy still coming off recent highs as NQ fully takes over.
1135 2018-05-28 16:15:21 Understood. I've been on the fence about AR style rifles but I'm leaning more towards not banning. I am in favor of fixing the background checks, banning bump stocks and limiting magazine/clip capacities, though I'm not sure what the limit should reasonably be.

1148 2018-05-28 16:07:29 Ban AR15, large magazines, bump stocks, raise age to 21, more extensive back ground checks. If they want to compare guns with cars as deadly weapons, let them pass test much like a driving test before getting a license. Be required to carry insurance much like car insurance.

1165 2018-05-28 15:53:42 Bump stocks are an important, but less effective step than getting military grade weapons out of the general market.  We regulate automotive vehicles not because their main purpose is to be deadly, but because the reckless operation of them can be. Guns only purpose is to kill.

1175 2018-05-28 15:41:23 We can ban bump stocks!
1176 2018-05-28 15:40:29 So again: keep your guns, harden schools w/out arming teachers, restrict sale of guns and accessories designed to inflict mass casualties, better screen prospective gun buyers, better track gun stocks, and require competency testing and accountability  for legal owners.

1186 2018-05-28 15:28:04 David has a common sense solution.  Ban bump stocks and assault weapons and you’ve stopped 90% of mass killing. Background checks, raise purchase age to 21.  Every one who wants to buy any gun should show hunter safety card.

If we re-apply, the ball would be in our court - EFTA, EEA, full membership, some hybrid of them all - we would negotiate.
We have HUGE fish stocks, Huge oil reserves, green energy, whisky, tourism, agricultural produce, etc, etc.

1216 2018-05-28 15:04:57 For those of you that were in these 2 groups on FB, Day Trading and Stock Trading, I've left both groups. Got tired of the juvenile dialect and posts.

1217 2018-05-28 15:04:05 Just wait until their earnings report comes out for month of May. Then quarterly report.  These number are padded. George & Robert Soros just bought huge amounts of stocks to offset paper losses.

1219 2018-05-28 15:03:44 Nasdaq valuations are at the same level as they were during the dot com bust. Yet people are telling us that Tech stocks are cheap and that this is all normal. Factor in the reversal of quantitative easing & rising interest rates & I all see is a disaster.
1220 2018-05-28 15:03:43 Guys @mystockedge As req,pls add promoter pledged share data to the app,that wud give 1 additional check bfr buying stocks. Awesome App otherwise ,pls add further features which wud benefit investing community like promoters prev company names etc in future. Thanks.
1221 2018-05-28 15:01:20 So if you know me you know how cheap I am, so last night I got hella lit and was scrolling down Twitter, Saw this ad for this Robinhood stocks or some shit like that, I been saying to myself I was gone start to invest and see how things go , well last night I just took two grand
1222 2018-05-28 15:00:48 Because banning bump stocks is stupid and raising the age limit for firearms is even dumber.
1223 2018-05-28 15:00:01 Renew the historic TAX RELIEF for the Ameri? Insurance stocks, which have gone on. Goodness, their courage and grit, may someday be recognized as a way of our cities, towns and parks will be used! Starving or killing his people, will be great!

1225 2018-05-28 14:59:07 I've lost some lately; it all depends on what our money was invested in! Stocks go up or down; don't think I could do my own investing, buying or selling! Average person wouldn't have a clue, would just be gambling

1229 2018-05-28 14:56:40 Personally.. these prices don’t scare me.. you get used to these dips after a while lol. If I’d have to say, I’d say we’re between panic and capitulation. I think we could see another drop down to Maybe 7k. Than uptrend. Stocks have flat lined for a bit. Transfer of $$$ soon?
1230 2018-05-28 14:55:44 If social responsibility becomes a common part of valuation, would those cheap stocks just stay cheap indefinitely?
1231 2018-05-28 14:51:54 The remaining stocks. Hurry up.
1232 2018-05-28 14:51:26 Ban bump stocks!
1233 2018-05-28 14:50:25 Actually the depression didnt start with a panic, it started with a huge job loss due to the dust bowl, Rockefeller and Carnegie had dumped huge funds on our economy so many had stocks to sell
1234 2018-05-28 14:50:18 Ban bump stocks.
1235 2018-05-28 14:50:12 The rumour is circulationg, that main ports of #Brazil, Santos and #Paranagua, have limited grain stocks, and if the strikes continue this week, we could see loading delays and higher #export prices
1236 2018-05-28 14:49:57 Corn has the best outlook. Planting delays continue in western CB, with yld potential slipping. S&D shows we need every corn acre and yld needs to be at or above trend.  Otherwise stocks could drop below 1 BB. Trading at new highs at planting very friendly. Weather key this week.

1238 2018-05-28 14:47:46 Banks do not buy stocks , but ETFs when prop trading, and this is why there is no volume in the market.  They don't trust the stocks and people stopped paying from the several corrections that smashed the market without logical reason in the eyes of your average day investor.
1239 2018-05-28 14:46:43 One has a higher magazine capacity and can be supplemented with bump stocks. The other is a fucking handgun. One kills more people more efficiently than another. It's basic logic.

1269 2018-05-28 14:16:45 It is true the sharp fall in the value of the Sri Lankan currency is prompting foreign portfolio investors to dump stocks & bonds as they apprehend more depreciation & also a fall in asset values since interest rates look like they're going to rise #lka

1275 2018-05-28 14:13:17 @SmashTheBid hey man! I think I remember reading from you about getting really to know a few stocks and trading them and intimacy helps, but do you mean by intimacy specifically? And does that translate to directly helping in your intraday trading of those underlying?

1283 2018-05-28 14:07:41 That's a short term view. Employees also hold these stocks, so buybacks might benefit them, too. Think long term: reducing the # of stocks may lift the trading price. What if that's leveraged to modernize/expand/pay #retirees' pension obligations?

1294 2018-05-28 14:01:04 This a precursor of budget things to come @BruceLesley . Conservatives will be asking poor kids programs to pay for the massive tax cuts for the wealthy so they can reinvest all that wealth in buying back their own stocks.  Legal corruption

Because I was faced with the same choice as you apparently.
1393 2018-05-28 12:54:30 Bump stocks should be banned.  There’s no need for them to be available to the general public.
1394 2018-05-28 12:54:14 No I need you to not tell me what I can & can’t have. You can still buy fully automatic weapons just need a license and some cash. Banning bump stocks will do nothing they are a novelty in the gun industry. Two of the states that already banned them no one turned them in

1402 2018-05-28 12:48:55 Why then haven’t they actually banned bump stocks, if they support it?  Because it effects gun sales/ownership which is what they actually support.  Public talk isn’t the same as action.

1420 2018-05-28 12:37:34 Stocks are nothing more than claims on assets of the firm- a major aspect of which is the amount of land they hold. It‘s no coincidence that REITs have been among the hottest performers.
1421 2018-05-28 12:37:10 Yes I know this is going to sound dumb BUT if you Tokenise an office building, who asset manages it? Companies have ongoing management structures so shares/stocks run parallel to management but a building with 10,000 ‘Owners’, who manages that?

1583 2018-05-28 10:39:01 Corporations are just groups of people pooling their resources. 
Smart responsible people invest in stocks for retirement, not envy. 
Tax cuts and deregulation are doing great for American workers.
1584 2018-05-28 10:38:07 I am having trouble finding the numbers, but it was pretty small. I think it was the 1934 law that really did the most good. It required that automatic rifles be registered. It notably included silencers , which are a weapon modifiers. Bump stocks could be treated similarly.
1585 2018-05-28 10:37:38 Je relance l'équipe en charge des stocks le mieux c'est de suivre par mail si j'ai une estimation à vous donner je reviens vers vous.
1586 2018-05-28 10:37:31 Rule 4: Buy Damaged Stocks, Not Damaged Companies
There are no refunds on Wall Street, so do your research and focus your trades on damaged stocks rather than companies
1587 2018-05-28 10:36:26 So , momentum mafia has found its mojo again.  I see the usual bandicoots back in WA with stories, snippets & plugs for their fallen stocks.

1591 2018-05-28 10:30:11 Rule 9: Defend Some Stocks, Not All
When trading gets tough, pick your favorite stocks and defend only those.
1592 2018-05-28 10:28:33 Rule 15: Don't Forget Bonds
It's important to watch more than stocks, and bonds are stocks' direct competition.
1593 2018-05-28 10:28:14 Rule 16: Never Subsidize Losers With Winners
Any trader stuck in this position would do well to sell sinking stocks and wait a day.
1594 2018-05-28 10:28:05 You are right, it's never easy. I screw it up all the time. But the hard decisions are the ones we need to figure out so that we can mature as investors. Should add: If you still believe in your #stocks, do nothing at all.
1595 2018-05-28 10:27:37 Italian #bonds and #stocks turned negative on the day, wiping out gains from earlier in the session, partly on fears over fresh elections and as investors took advantage of a brief rally to sell their Italian assets.

Never underestimate the promotion machine because analysts get behind stocks and can keep them propelled in an up direction well beyond reason.

Your filters for portfolio stocks should be very strong otherwise waste will get accumulated over a period of time.

1835 2018-05-28 06:08:00 Disagree. Diversification can also make you rich as it allows you to own stocks with assymetric payoffs which a focussed portfolio can't own due to inherent risks. Eg. Avanti feeds - given disease risk only a diversified portfolio could have held it and has made many quite rich.

1883 2018-05-28 05:28:01 1/ a lot of countries still have non equity based pensions. In the US where this is most prevalent:
2/ half of ppl only own stocks

4/ top 10% own 75% of pension funds value

It’s wealth gap widening on steroids.

1894 2018-05-28 05:13:14 I guess we will have to agree to disagree. I personally think our country is so much better off now then when Obama was president. My stocks are up, I've got a raise due to the tax cuts. I dont expect you to get it. I could care less if he loves the power. Obama loved it too!

1906 2018-05-28 05:01:11 I agree there that's why chefs make stocks from the bones because they have and add a lot of flavor.
1907 2018-05-28 05:00:52 Let's go! Banning bump stocks is an infitesmal step in decreasing the risks of guns in America but it's a step that needs to be taken nonetheless.
1908 2018-05-28 05:00:04 Bump stocks must be made illegal, like any other firearm modification to "automatic Fire" is illegal. In addition, they should be recalled from anyone who owns a bump stock.

1922 2018-05-28 04:47:00 Political instability & high levels of debt have left caused a downturn in Euro markets.

1928 2018-05-28 04:44:16 hahahahaha the state of New Jersey issued a ban and return on bump stocks for semi auto rifles. the police said nobody handed over a thing hahahahaha
1929 2018-05-28 04:43:22 Black market for stocks sounds cool but is not a big risk - because it comes back to issuers holding so much power - this is different from the security model of Bitcoin - in this case we don’t mind a power trusted party because we already trust them- this is all about the ledger

1931 2018-05-28 04:40:35 It is extremely difficult to obtain automatic weapons. It shows that laws governing the possession of weapons work. If you are happy with the automatic weapon laws then we can do the same for bump stocks. I'd be very happy with that.

1933 2018-05-28 04:39:43 Does anyone use stocks to pay for anything? Equity markets are efficient, with near instantaneous price discovery. Did the rise of stock markets reduce the demand for money?
1934 2018-05-28 04:39:22 Agree, but couldn't this open up a black market for stocks? 
I have another question, how do you solve privacy concerns (market participants don't want their positions known) if the ledger is public?
1935 2018-05-28 04:38:28 Ban bump stocks and the guns that go with them!

1941 2018-05-28 04:29:51 Dont think the DRB% means much but I dont think you can really dominate in zone D as a wing unless you get a shitload of stocks and rebounds, so I assumed that's what u meant.

1949 2018-05-28 04:23:48 He’s never locking dudes up and yeah the stocks should be higher IMO. Hate to use that as a proxy for D but he does underwhelm there. DREB% is really fake, they don’t play a 5 half the time and always clear out for him to get boards. Altho it makes sense bc they get transition O

1952 2018-05-28 04:21:42 what do you mean by dominant? Like his stocks? He had 2.7 stl% and 25.6 Dreb%.. He gets lost sometimes, doesn't have the best instincts but makes some really nice plays too. I would lean towards more bad than good on his D but I dont think its horrible by any stretch

1969 2018-05-28 04:12:20 Right. So, he was responding to Hogg’s comment about banning bump stocks. He thought he was being dismissive by posting a primer on admin rulemaking as if the president has no role in that. Obviously that’s not correct or a sound argument. You agree on that at least?

1972 2018-05-28 04:11:04 Main problem with blockchain tokenized assets--converting them all to end-user bearer assets is a bad idea. Private keys are lost often--losing a key will lose your stocks? If losing the key doesn't matter then we aren't fully moving to blockchain tokenization--we are pretending.

1984 2018-05-28 04:04:03 I think that's the key data point here. We know there is a cyclical downturn in progress (see ECRI). We know that a common response to late-cycle cyclical weakness (see H12015 and 1999) is a short lived, narrow rally focused on secular growth stocks. That's what's coming next.

1989 2018-05-28 04:01:17 Bump stocks have nothing to do with our rights. They need to be banned and kept out of the hands of everyone that thinks they’re necessary. If you believe you will someday need these to hunt down your fellow citizens, then you definitely shouldn’t have one. #BanBumpStocks

1996 2018-05-28 03:57:54 One thing I must say about regulations is no more bump stocks. Not one person should be allowed to buy them. Bump stocks were created to cut recoil in automatic weapons. If you aren't military, you don't need a bump stock.
1997 2018-05-28 03:54:14 We need to ban bump stocks. We need safe schools. We need compassion in the USA. We need each other more than ever.

2103 2018-05-28 02:52:21 Ban bump stocks
2104 2018-05-28 02:50:25 I support the ban on Bump Stocks...and all guns designed to kill humans used in mass shooting and killing kids, families and People of every Color!!
2105 2018-05-28 02:49:59 Make in India has to make Indians - workers, poorer. Competing with China needs cheaper: Land, Labor & Capital. Bank loots by Mallya, N Modi.. brings down value of bank stocks & Rupees - cost of living or poverty rises. Price rise like of petroleum makes petrol companies richer

2145 2018-05-28 02:26:26 Top Fundamentals are no guarantee for success with stocks, so is the chart action, even a picture perfect chart can fail - it is a game of probabilities. Cut-loss sure protects the capital as $FANG demonstrated recently.
2146 2018-05-28 02:25:34 So how does Cede & Co relate to who the ultimate beneficial owners really should be?  Through pronisorry notes that say that brokers should honor what a company called DTCC says on who should receive what the benefit of the stock would be — no one actually owns their stocks

2154 2018-05-28 02:21:52 Really need to start investing in stocks and stop just talking about it
2155 2018-05-28 02:21:31 If only we had banned AR-15s and bump stocks
2156 2018-05-28 02:21:04 Listen junior . Go serve I. The military then talk . The most damaging round is a .22 cal . People kill people. Not bump stocks
2157 2018-05-28 02:19:27 I believe the age of purchase for firearms should be 21, but banning bump-stocks would do absolutely nothing. The same process of bump-firing can be accomplished with a rubber band and about 30 minutes of practice.
2158 2018-05-28 02:19:23 Makes sense. Look at the Boards PP:PP Members & Sugges’s Thread starts on post #175. Bill’s post is #185.  I was excited to add to my other positions $JD $TCEHY $BIDU $IQ before the ruling. Since there would be no dilution of the stocks, i thought it would create more demand. Thx

2164 2018-05-28 02:15:41 Ban Bump Stocks! (and I like your hat)
2165 2018-05-28 02:15:39 No one without military training should have a MILITARY gun. Bump stocks are not even used in hunting. Perhaps Trump can explain why he will go down in history as "the man who let foreign children go missing and American kids die".A TERROR-FILLED LEGACY has no bragging rights.
2166 2018-05-28 02:14:24 You can ban bump stocks solely based on Twitter comments?  I think you should have finished school
2167 2018-05-28 02:14:23 I've only really lost from holding onto trash. for long term and hoping it would go up, which it did, but I never cashed in. Was forced to observe the market, so I can somewhat tell which stocks may spike the next day, but I have to also do that before I even put in the money.

2173 2018-05-28 02:12:46 Ban bump stocks now
2174 2018-05-28 02:11:08 So think of it as restricted and centralized while restricted — but that’s how stocks are already — once the restrictions end trading becomes WAY more free and issuers DO NOT know who the holders are anymore — the brokers don’t know either other than their own customer list
2175 2018-05-28 02:11:08 Ban bump stocks

Unless it's cause Thailand doesn't have steel & aluminum tariffs, if they build parts there US no tariff against Thai.

2192 2018-05-28 01:57:45 We need to ban bump stocks
2193 2018-05-28 01:57:03 You realize the "AR" in AR-15 doesn't mean "assault rifle",don't you?  When anyone can order a 40% milled "assault rifle" and have it mailed to their home by UPS, then finish the rest with some simple tools, what makes you think that banning bump stocks are the answer?
2194 2018-05-28 01:53:15 F&O Ban stocks for 28-5-2018:

    In Ban: BEML, DHFL, IDBI, Jet Airways, Jain Irrigation, Just Dial, Reliance Communications

2195 2018-05-28 01:52:32 Yup, if we all knew the stocks would be going, they would already be going up.

2198 2018-05-28 01:50:12 But I'll give you bump stocks. Btw...Trump offered that already.
2199 2018-05-28 01:49:47 Literally even the president supports tougher background checks, banning of bump stocks, and raising the minimum age to 21.
2200 2018-05-28 01:49:42 Ban bump stocks!!!!!!
2201 2018-05-28 01:49:22 There are many factors that come into play either fundamentally and or technically as well as market sentiment which is the basis of this poll. Leading into June 7th market sentiment IMO will be the leading cause of these stocks to go up. What happens a week after is TBD
2202 2018-05-28 01:46:59 Are you paying attention? Stocks? Job market? GDP? Unemployment? Growth of the economy? Shit is booming right now
2203 2018-05-28 01:46:10 Yup. Even David Hemenway from Harvard says that raising the age to 21 has no evidential support, and bump stocks are really simple devices. Therefore, easy to produce on your own.
2204 2018-05-28 01:44:56 Php 1,300. Only 3 stocks left.

2206 2018-05-28 01:43:23 What are bump stocks  ???
2207 2018-05-28 01:42:46 Ban bump stocks!
2208 2018-05-28 01:42:36 I hope I’m wrong. But it seems like when everyone thinks the stocks will go up they don’t. And vice versa.
2209 2018-05-28 01:41:46 Right. Bump stocks have become the bogeyman of people who know absolutely nothing about guns.

2214 2018-05-28 01:39:05 Common sense gun laws: 
-people on the terrorism watch list shouldn’t be able to buy guns. 
-ban of bump stocks
-weapons of war shouldn’t be able to be bought by civilians (a reasonable and enforceable definition of an assault weapon would be critical) 
-magazine size limitation
2215 2018-05-28 01:37:51 Actually, when Donald Trump moved to ban bump stocks, he classified it under the Justice Department’s regulation that classified the hardware as a machine gun accessory. Anyone who bought a bump stock after that, bought it illegally.
2216 2018-05-28 01:36:57 Bump stocks kill. Period.
2217 2018-05-28 01:36:28 Bitcoin and #cryptocurrency market with gold have beared as stocks rebounded as Trump's threat to markets dimminish. #Bitcoin will take off with more usefulness and partnerships. This is a great buying opportunity.

2223 2018-05-28 01:32:59 I'll comment to ban bump stocks. There is gun fire in rhe streets of Philadelphia every night or at least what the news reports. The gun shit needs to stop! Good luck with your goal!

2227 2018-05-28 01:30:45 Anyone that knows anything about world oil prices knows that the Iran deal is a total nonevent. The reality is that the the Saudis agreed to increase production by 2 MB and prices and oil stocks both dropped on Friday. The US is no longer dependent on Middle East oil.

2237 2018-05-28 01:25:54 I mean DCA into a TAA strategy.  A 50/50 (or 70/30) buy & hold will DCA into stocks during all good and bad months. On months when TAA is in cash DCA may stay in cash instead of 'buying low' (ex. March 2009). My question boils down to 'does it make sense to DCA into a TAA strat?

2247 2018-05-28 01:20:02 Ban bump stocks
2248 2018-05-28 01:19:52 Our pleasure. We are just a stones throw away from Chicagoland speedway. We love you guys and all racing! Our local track has midgets and late model stocks on pavement all the time! Can't wait for Belle Isle!
2249 2018-05-28 01:19:24 I bet Netflix stocks are going to plummet -
2250 2018-05-28 01:18:51 Why haven’t you done the gazillions of things you promised to do? Oh, we’re still waiting for the ban on bump stocks you promised. Liar, liar, pants on   
2251 2018-05-28 01:17:51 Dad is teaching me about stocks and stuff
2252 2018-05-28 01:17:20 This is shameful Katie,if these people are found guilty they should be put in the stocks and the family of those girls should be let loose on them.
2253 2018-05-28 01:16:51 Joey how does it feel knowing that every single person who reads your tweets thinks you're clueless.   You're easily one of the biggest laughing-stocks on Twitter.   Do you honestly not realize that at all?
2254 2018-05-28 01:16:47 @realDonaldTrump : Why didn’t you follow through on banning bump-stocks and raising the age to purchase firearm to 21 like you promised? @davidhogg111
2255 2018-05-28 01:16:27 Go ahead and ban bump stocks. It will save exactly zero lives.

Raising the gun purchase age to 21, that might save a few lives, but considering that in most of the recent shootings the shooters got the guns from their parents, this won't really fix anything either.
2256 2018-05-28 01:15:36 And good luck to @jackmilleraus in Mugello for the MotoGP this weekend, whose stocks are on the rise with a factory Ducati ride a real possibility!
2257 2018-05-28 01:15:19 Bump stocks should be illegal.
2258 2018-05-28 01:14:38 It was a major investment for them and they can’t let it go. It is like holding on to bad stocks, you think they may rebound. Nothing they have thrown at Trump sticks. I like watching them dig their own graves.
2259 2018-05-28 01:14:19 Problem: 10 people were murdered by a minor who illegally obtained a shotgun & 6-shot revolver at a High School in Texas.
Solution: Ban bump stocks, ban "assault rifles", universal background checks, raise legal age limit to buy a gun 
2260 2018-05-28 01:12:51 No doubt if you exceed the NRA's bribe monies tRump might, maybe, possibly reverse his reversal of his reverse on bump stocks n age restriction.

2267 2018-05-28 01:10:15 I met the head of a huge & incredibly successful endowment yesterday. He's a wonderful, smart, humble guy who considers "social responsibility" essential to what they do, regardless of how it affects performance. As this becomes widespread it will create some VERY cheap stocks.
2268 2018-05-28 01:07:30 Ban bump stocks now.
2269 2018-05-28 01:06:46 I’m watching...if he does anything out of order, please tell me. So I can cut off his Oreo supply stocks.
2270 2018-05-28 01:06:05 Because people aren't stupid enough to actually do it and realise you can bump fire without a bump stock. New Jersey banned bump stocks wanna know how many bump stocks got turned in? 3
2271 2018-05-28 01:05:59 This shouldn’t even be an issue. P. Clinton banned assault rifles for 10 years. When the ban expired G.W. Bush didn’t extend it. 
There is no reason not to ban assault weapons along with bump stocks.
2272 2018-05-28 01:04:21 But their 401k's ...it's all about those that are seeing an increase in THEIR stocks who are still cheering.
2273 2018-05-28 01:03:57 Ban bump stocks!  No need or purpose for these in civilized society.

2281 2018-05-28 00:56:46 Ban bump stocks!!!
2282 2018-05-28 00:55:27 There's no need for bump stocks
2283 2018-05-28 00:54:09 Most of the stocks peddled by dear Prof SB and presented as classroom examples- Kitex, Premco Global, Ashiana Housing, etc

While there is no doubting the intent of prof. but his recos leave a lot left  to be desired. How do you see this? Divide of theory from practice?
2284 2018-05-28 00:53:16 Haha. Happy to help.  Do it. With savings like that you’d be crazy not to. Only while stocks last. See website for terms and conditions. 
2285 2018-05-28 00:52:10 Ban bump stocks and all assault rifles.
2286 2018-05-28 00:49:15 Ban bump stocks and semi-automatic weapons.
2287 2018-05-28 00:48:34 What’s stocks? Is that an ICO?
2288 2018-05-28 00:48:16 Please outlaw Bump Stocks. They're not used for hunting. They have one use: To kill people.
2289 2018-05-28 00:47:58 BAN BUMP STOCKS!!!!

2295 2018-05-28 00:44:01 You have my support.  Bump stocks need to be banned.
2296 2018-05-28 00:41:14 Ban bump stocks!
2297 2018-05-28 00:40:58 Ban bump stocks, save children

2299 2018-05-28 00:38:15 Nothing out of the box company $AMB . Only makes a small profit and has been profitable for a few years.What surprises me is there is not one buyer in the screen and yet people are chasing speculative rubbish stocks?
2300 2018-05-28 00:37:16 Banning bump stocks doesn't infringe on 2nd amendment rights. No gun owner needs what only military in combat needs. If you want military-style weapons, join the military - but even then, you would get specialized training and safety instructions. Things common gun owners do not.
2301 2018-05-28 00:37:12 happened to me on iracing, cost me a top 15 in rookie street stocks
2302 2018-05-28 00:34:20 Banning bump stocks is the ABSOLUTE VERY LEAST anybody can do to possibly ameliorate the damage of the next Las Vegas. But at least it's something. SO DO IT! #BanBumpStocks
2303 2018-05-28 00:34:07 What happens if land values collapse in the meantime? Will the deferred taxes be cancelled? When you buy stocks, you only pay tax once you sell & gains/losses are realized (because your stock can drop in value just as fast as it rose). Until the land is sold, there is no profit.
2304 2018-05-28 00:33:43 Ban bump stocks. Ban assault weapons.
2305 2018-05-28 00:33:37 Banning bump stocks is quite literally the least you can do.
2306 2018-05-28 00:33:23 Stocks can make you wait for many years and give many years return even in a single year.

2321 2018-05-28 00:19:54 TMFOtter doesn’t believe there will be any form of arbitrage on Chinese stocks even if the ruling passes for Domestic investors to buy these companies. Could you elaborate or point me to info that would help me be better informed? Great episode. Cheers! Scotty G
2322 2018-05-28 00:19:03 It seems like regardless of a pro-gun or gun-control opinion you should oppose bump stocks. A bump stock takes a semiautomatic weapon and makes it basically automatic. It is a mechanical loophole.
2323 2018-05-28 00:18:36 Unless it’s bump stocks, SBR’s, SBS’s Suppressors, and automatic weapons. Then you throw our rights in a dumpster fire. #GOA #NotRealActivists
2324 2018-05-28 00:17:59 I think bump stocks should have been banned long ago.
2325 2018-05-28 00:17:58 Hi, good morning. Purchase can be done via our website or via one of our outlets. While stocks last ya. Thank you.

2328 2018-05-28 00:16:52 Bump stocks should be banned.
2329 2018-05-28 00:16:51 We can ban bump stocks. If we get our (expletive deleted) together we might even be able to bring back the assault weapons ban
2330 2018-05-28 00:15:44 There's no reason bump stocks should be legal.  Their sole purpose is to make a semi-auto function like a fully auto weapon.

2332 2018-05-28 00:14:46 I agree. There is absolutely no need for bump stocks and they should be banned. Thanks for all you do to keep us safe.

2334 2018-05-28 00:14:19 Bump stocks have no "sporting" use. They only enable you to fire more rapidly; or as we pobres say "waste money faster".

2336 2018-05-28 00:13:55 I will agree with you to ban bump stocks. We dont need them. But your trying to ban something that has only been used once maybe twice in mass shootings. Alot of wasted energy
2337 2018-05-28 00:12:57 Tron doesnt deserve to be on Apple Stocks. My two cents.
2338 2018-05-28 00:10:41 I agree; banning bump stocks probably won't make a difference; there will likely be more mass shootings in the future--with or without them on the market. 
If responsible gun users like you don't have a use for them because of the inaccuracy they cause, what is the point?

2342 2018-05-28 00:08:37 Looks MM left the crude mkt, leaving a support void, while specs still rallying on IR/PdVSA, feedback momentum.  Specs scared off by new bearish signals (wkly stocks, DXY, trade wars, soft Euro data) & started easing off. Then OPEC+ drama. The sink hole collapsed, & here we are.
2343 2018-05-28 00:08:30 This is plausible. Once Bitcoin is at big-size equilibrium, the wealthy will only store a fraction of their wealth there, with the remainder being in stocks, bonds and real estate anyway.

The biggest thing to consider, however: Bitcoin is unseizable & hidden. Real estate is not.
2344 2018-05-28 00:07:18 Ban bump stocks!
2345 2018-05-28 00:07:14 Great name, it's fitting. He wasn't at school at the time of the shooting, he went after, stories don't match up, he has told multiple different stories, documented on leftist news platforms. Bump stocks haven't been used in mass shootings, assault is a verb, anything can be an
2346 2018-05-28 00:05:45 But at 300-400 yards away, he'd have caused a lot more Carnage without one.

Like I keep saying, ban bump stocks if you wish to, but it won't make any difference.
2347 2018-05-28 00:03:33 Yes ban bump stocks! Ban assault rifles as well!
2348 2018-05-28 00:03:17 Ban bump stocks
