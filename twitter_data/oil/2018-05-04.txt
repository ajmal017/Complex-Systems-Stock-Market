42 2018-05-06 23:56:08 Trump is doing great things. He's rolling back regulations, cutting unemployment, defeated ISIS, working out trade imbalance with China, opening up oil exploration and drilling, exposing corruption in media and more. What's your happy alternative?
43 2018-05-06 23:56:06 I was gonna go Thursday but my dad might change my oil and all that so it might be too late and I'll go Friday instead. Still trying to figure it all out
44 2018-05-06 23:55:46 Vast oil exporter and natural gas exporter thru liquid natural gas (LNG) and pipeline to Europe. 

Also they have water access and Gaddafi had vast personal wealth

Why Blair, Cameron, Sarkozy, and of course Obama and Hillary, many countries wanted access to Libya.
45 2018-05-06 23:55:24 Been using cbd coconut oil on my face and hole shit it’s helped
46 2018-05-06 23:55:23 Cam: “yo edges on fleek...okay I see you...got yo lil edge oil...”

 y’all I was in the gas station screamingggggggg!
47 2018-05-06 23:55:22 Significantly less oil, like 95%
48 2018-05-06 23:55:15 I use the oil. Be getting all the love.

52 2018-05-06 23:54:25 I’ve seen him pressed on the supposed DVD and he talks in circles every time. He’s a snake oil salesmen if I’ve ever seen one. Dude is the exact reason people hate lawyers.
53 2018-05-06 23:53:59 Easy: trim the stem & the spiky ends off the top and of each leaf. Rub those areas with lemon. Upside down in a glass bowl with some water, lemon juice & olive oil. Cover bowl and microwave[!!!] 7 - 12 minutes depending on size. Dip in garlic butter or lemon garlic aioli. Enjoy!
54 2018-05-06 23:53:52 I seen Donald Glover Looking Like a Sweet potato covered in baby oil in that video and kept scrolling
55 2018-05-06 23:53:47 Energy storage. The thing about a carbohydrate is that it has lots of bonds to store energy.  Oil and gas have more bonds than alcohol. But it still comes down to energy storage. Batteries. One form or another.
56 2018-05-06 23:53:39 hey boss, oil both sides of the bread
57 2018-05-06 23:53:37 Seal in your conditioner with an oil. I personally use Vitamin E oil. Refresh my hair 3 or so days.
58 2018-05-06 23:52:24 I just saw your tweet. My God! Woman this is your calling!! First oil and it's perfect!! Is it someone you know? Do U find a pic and do it? I want to know how you chose your subject. Paint someone you know that can pose for U. I love the feel of oil paints, too.
59 2018-05-06 23:52:11 @UraniumEnergy have you thought of expanding. I designed oil extract fromcoal . 41% more oil reserves 720 billion cash flow first year with one plant . more oil in Kentucky than IRAN .  a site  Salyersville Kentucky is ready to be built on and no pollution in air or water plant
60 2018-05-06 23:52:05 PSA: Guys, unless you're built like @Oil_Guns_Merica (spoiler alert...you probably aren't), you should probably keep your shirt on....
61 2018-05-06 23:52:01 yea anything with mint/camphor oil does wonders, i have a bunch of tiger balm lying around for that reason, uhhh vapor rub and salonpas would work too iirc
62 2018-05-06 23:52:00 They just finished my oil change....smh
63 2018-05-06 23:51:57 Disgusting Oil Hole

65 2018-05-06 23:51:29 Rub olive oil on the asparagus and apply S&P. Can add rub if desired. Place a strip of Brie cheese along the spear and wrap in a thinly sliced strip of prosciutto.

Grill on a grill topper. The prosciutto holds in the melted brie. Turns out beautiful.
66 2018-05-06 23:51:17 Get a yellow can for the gas/oil mix so you dont screw it up now. :)
67 2018-05-06 23:51:10 Pollen is out to kill me. Literally have to get an inhaler to open these airways like I’ve had to do every spring since 2015. In the meantime, I hope this eucalyptus essential oil works.
68 2018-05-06 23:51:01 Allahummagfirli mayyitana  I really cried today...
May Allah 4 give their souls and accept their shahadas
69 2018-05-06 23:50:57 You're actually retarded. I used to build PCs in elementary school for people's parents. I prefer console over PC. That's the dumbest accusation I've ever heard  and buddy you take pictures of bath oil before taking a shower, your point? 
70 2018-05-06 23:50:35 I think we need to address the practical situation with declined oil & gas revenues, young people out of work, etc.  As a senior/semi retired I see others being set back & poor starter job prospects for next 5-10 yrs.
71 2018-05-06 23:50:30 Want to help stop buying gas from gas companies that purchase their oil from Middle Eastern countries there are quite a few Speedway is one of them
72 2018-05-06 23:50:20 @SamanthaKelly69 id love to squueze those tits and put oil on em!
73 2018-05-06 23:50:10 My massage therapist decided that my freshly washed hair needed a handful of massage oil. Now I look like a greasy hobo.
74 2018-05-06 23:50:05 girl mix it highlight with coconut oil. you’re welcome
75 2018-05-06 23:50:04 His drone program killed untold thousands if not over a million people, and Obama should have ended those wars, not added to them. 

When they're fighting for oil, or protecting Afghanistan's Poppy fields, or invading countries because they dropped the dollar? No I don't.
76 2018-05-06 23:50:03 Rasa teringin giler nak beli coconut oil. Heard a lot of good things about it. Plus, it smells amazing and is cheaper than most hair serum.
77 2018-05-06 23:50:02 Gotta change my oil in 8k miles

82 2018-05-06 23:48:34 Oh no! I totally understand what you are facing. In a different way. We finally ended our relationship with our family home of 50 years a few years back. It took us a while to let it go. Oil tank issues and all! I went over there like I owned the joint and started marching around

87 2018-05-06 23:47:18 You can't go wrong blaming the downturn in oil prices on Rachel Notley.  It's a tried and true formula for success!
88 2018-05-06 23:47:12 The unimaginable things I have seen in international waters on the open oceans would fill volumes:  Deckhands throwing tied plastic bags of trash off the boat; Engineers waiting until dark to clean bilges so the oil slick can't be spotted ... on&on ... Crimes against Nature
89 2018-05-06 23:47:10 For me, all that oil just bonds better after mixing it and leaving it in the fridge.
90 2018-05-06 23:47:07 Who wants to come rub oil in my scalp

95 2018-05-06 23:46:20 He is a snake oil salesman. He is a tabloid journalist who tells fantastical tales that people want to believe. He thinks people will believe anything he says, true or false. And unfortunately there is a vast majority who do.

97 2018-05-06 23:46:10 @SpyTalker Now that he has settled the score with Hillary, it's NOT going to be about #Trump.  It's probably going to be about sanctions and OIL. IRAN has been unusually quiet.

99 2018-05-06 23:45:42 Trump will move to put sanctions back onto Iran. Probably won't happen right away. Later BEVs will threaten oil.
100 2018-05-06 23:45:40 There isn’t one. I detest the way he lies as he speaks, no matter the reason, subject, context. He’s a snake oil salesman, a grifter. He always has been and always will be.

106 2018-05-06 23:44:55 #RudyGiuluani is #TheMooch in 50 years.  But, I am so happy he's giving interviews.  He's the New York City snake without the oil.  But he and Chief Whoremonger are only pandering to the Evangelical base, not anyone with common sense or  decency. Have at it. #entertainment

109 2018-05-06 23:44:36 This ^ with my face!!  Seriously oily in two sec and it didn't used to be like that!  I used to have dry patches on my face.  Now I'm a grease spot even with an oil free moisturizer.  Sigh
110 2018-05-06 23:44:33 Getting an oil change for the car. Probably gonna do some streaming when I get home. That new Patch for Dauntless is up ans I wanna check it out.
111 2018-05-06 23:44:25 Done getting oil changed. 
“That’s more like it! Now she’s runnin like butter on ice!”
112 2018-05-06 23:44:20 From how it is written they are not necessarily mad about the training but mad about the recording and releasing of it which seems to be fairly reasonable.
113 2018-05-06 23:44:02 First oil change. First time getting my hands covered in used oil. I guess I'm a Real Man (TM) now.

It ain't what it's cracked up to be.
114 2018-05-06 23:44:02 I thought Bloomberg was in financial related business. It sounds like more like an oil company.

119 2018-05-06 23:42:55 Yet we sell vast amounts of oil and gas that's harvested from here to obviously smarter nations. This quite simply represents a poor energy policy that is constantly ignored.

122 2018-05-06 23:42:24 I bought a groupon for an oil change but I still haven’t gotten it done. I need to do better.
123 2018-05-06 23:41:59 I’ve had my car since November 2016. I’ve had my oil changed once, March 2017.  I keep forgetting. With my old car, I was every 3 months like clockwork cause it kept making a noise that everyone claimed was the engine but nothing ever stopped it other than it warming up.
124 2018-05-06 23:41:48 That raises oil prices for Saudi and Russians. Israel would love to be only other Middle Eastern power. But Iran is messy with Russia. But none of this is a foregone conclusion
125 2018-05-06 23:41:36 People give you lots of grief and make fun of you, but obviously don’t see how far you’ve come. Outside of the “fans” I have only ever heard good things.

126 2018-05-06 23:41:27 Smelling musk oil perfume again... not a good sign.
127 2018-05-06 23:41:20 Gasoline will go up but that is good. We need higher oil prices to catapult our oil industry to USA energy independence. Ignore when the left blames Trump for oil prices. This is a very good thing for North America (US& Canada)

149 2018-05-06 23:37:15 if you are a BLCO buyer then you have good chance now.
You can buy BLCO in China Tank Farm.
But you have to show POF before TTM in China and issue SBLC after checking POP.

153 2018-05-06 23:36:35 Hello everyone i just came on to say fuck my stupid fucking face my oil diffuser turned over in my bed after I filled it up and now my shit is soaking wet
154 2018-05-06 23:36:33 Lol ur the one who started it , like literally ur adding oil to the fire
155 2018-05-06 23:36:20 I need fresh oil
156 2018-05-06 23:36:13 It depends on how much the big oil companies are contributing. Still driving those gas guzzling vehicles to keep those oil companies in business.
157 2018-05-06 23:36:12 The best way is just like how and why coal is never coming back.  Its not because of regulations, its because there are cheaper alternatives - in the case of coal, its natural gas. When demand, good batteries, and cheap solar can handle it, oil will go the way of coal.
158 2018-05-06 23:36:11 Subhanallah! I showed this post to my cousin and surprisingly he knew two of the deceased, from Zaria. May Allah forgive their shortcomings....
159 2018-05-06 23:36:07 I don't agree with using the recruits name in the video, and posting it for the world to see. However, it is the military's job to train us for war, because our enemies will not be forgiving, they will try to kill us by any means. We cannot have weakness in the military.
160 2018-05-06 23:36:02 this just reminded me to run my essential oil diffuser, god bless u Hannah

164 2018-05-06 23:34:57 ONCE for my mom's birthday dinner i accidentally mixed soy sauce with oil instead of vinegar
165 2018-05-06 23:34:39 I love that!!  I recently incorporated rosehip oil into my skincare routine and so far so good. Lmk how you like what you ordered.
166 2018-05-06 23:34:34 It’s so hot in my room that my coconut oil is liquid at room temp
167 2018-05-06 23:34:18 need some oil
168 2018-05-06 23:34:12 I just got ah oil change
169 2018-05-06 23:33:55 Lol. This was a 1 day visit. If you'd like to see quite a relationship: the US government was a far greater collaborator with IBM installing the machines & supplying the punchcards to the very end, Standard Oil supplying oil & all the money laundered by US banks for the Nazis
170 2018-05-06 23:33:52 Former Pres Obama sold snake oil in the form of Obama care and it's the Republican's fault? Come on man.
171 2018-05-06 23:33:26 Peppermint oil
172 2018-05-06 23:33:17 All you need is 2 cups all purpose flour, 1/2tsp baking soda, 1tbsp baking powder, 3/4tsp Himalayan Sea Salt, 4tbsp chilled coconut oil. After you've mixed that add 1 cup water & 1 tbsp lemon juice, knead the dough and drop them on a baking sheet with melted oil drizzled on top
173 2018-05-06 23:33:15 And barges already transport fuel to the gulf islands & US oil tankers sail along BC's coast daily. @Cheyom1 @ipoliticsca
174 2018-05-06 23:32:46 If oil hits $100 the thinking is already done. Otherwise?
175 2018-05-06 23:32:34 This is a heartbreaking AND terrifying reminder that (a) so called civilisation is still just a shot away & (b) western foreign policy in the Middle East from WW2, through Mosaddegh to this day has been a disaster for the people & all for a short term gain for big oil & bankers
176 2018-05-06 23:32:20 สำนึกผิดไม่ทันเลยพิจ้อน 
177 2018-05-06 23:31:39 All electric cars need to become cheaper, is for car companies to decide to invest in developing the technology. The problem is, they're in bed with Big Oil.
178 2018-05-06 23:31:35 いいのよ！またできる時やりましょーーー
179 2018-05-06 23:31:32 @Bolddigger52 thanks for the follow.

Wasn't that petition policy part of Camerons election campaign? Tax to move with oil price to creat stability?
180 2018-05-06 23:31:31 I'm glad I don't take OTC medicine besides melatonin and flaxseed oil
181 2018-05-06 23:31:23 I sensed that from the midnight oil tweet. I’ll try to be clearer in my tweets for Phil’s sake. Until he learns, then I’ll go back to normal
182 2018-05-06 23:31:19 Oil
183 2018-05-06 23:31:16 Nothing sexier than a man letting you oil up his shoulders and giving him a massage.
184 2018-05-06 23:31:14 Every act done with no expectancy of the reward is the true form of selfless act.

187 2018-05-06 23:30:25 Wife:  (texting) The mower stopped and it won't start back...the oil might be low.
Me: Ok, just park it.
Me: Gets home, checks oil and it's fine...investigates a little more...add gas, mower starts on first pull...lol...love her!
188 2018-05-06 23:30:24 You can't just shut off a problem pipe leak b/c it's pressurized and will blow even a greater area full of oil. Toxins are huge problem b/c they lie low to the ground. First responders don't have 35k hazmat suits. Tank farm in Burnaby is huge risk.
189 2018-05-06 23:30:23 Aw, did someone oil your pole?

Wait....not what I meant.
190 2018-05-06 23:30:14 Aunt jackies leave in conditioner after washing my hair with aunt Jackies shampoo and soft n free conditioner, I occasionally use tresemme. aunt jackies curl la la curl activator, sta sof fro curl activator daily, also castor oil regularly. X
191 2018-05-06 23:30:11 just had coconut oil on my hair for 3 hours and followed it up with a blow dry whilst wearing a face mask. who is SHEEEEE
192 2018-05-06 23:30:03 You should really be playing the video of the oil gushing out of KM pipeline in Burnaby lol
193 2018-05-06 23:30:01 Where does Oil come from
194 2018-05-06 23:30:00 Miami is the "capital of diving in sunken ships". Along its coast there are dozens of immersion sites ranging from ships to oil platforms and a Boeing 727, remains that have become artificial reefs. #home

195 2018-05-06 23:29:56 Girl if you like exfoliation and a Lord of Misrule scent, come to your local Lush and let us show you our The Rough With the Smooth shower scrub! It's got that same patchouli and black pepper oil from Lord of Misrule and leaves you just as velvety soft (if not more).
196 2018-05-06 23:29:34 Next person I hear recommend others use coconut oil on their face is going to major side-eye from me. STOP!
197 2018-05-06 23:29:28 I agree
198 2018-05-06 23:29:22 If the high priests of your cult believed it was a real problem, why don't they ban oil use immediately?
Instead they live lives with huge carbon footprints. 
Actions speak much louder than words.
199 2018-05-06 23:29:09 Sitting at the drive thru oil change place. In the car while they’re working on it. Nick says “this is the good life”.
200 2018-05-06 23:28:52 Again. Why sit money in a dead space? Would you rather been in uranium or oil plays starting a few months ago? When uranium starts moving I’ll get in. But not parking money into a idle space
201 2018-05-06 23:28:50 おはぽーん！
202 2018-05-06 23:28:43 おはぽーん。昨日はごめんねごめんね〜〜
203 2018-05-06 23:28:27 I think you trying to mix oil and water. JK and Ramana Maharishi can not be mixed with the rest.
204 2018-05-06 23:28:22 For as long as I can remember I’ve always had steamed broccoli but tonight I roasted it in the oven with olive oil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper and wow it’s delish

210 2018-05-06 23:27:28 Today I, a princess, tied my hair up, put on my Deftones-only playlist and cleaned my apartment top to bottom. I now have three candles lit and an essential oil diffuser running. This is the best feeling *in the world*.
211 2018-05-06 23:27:08 Still not as nice as my Lost Horizon oil paint set 
212 2018-05-06 23:27:01 @tuffcitypower had oil streaming out of scooter following oil change with TUFF CITY IMG_0282.MOV
213 2018-05-06 23:26:56 With crude oil prices moving up and rupee is likely to depreciate to 68-70.Sensex will see correction and may touch 32000. It is time to be cautious and wait and watch before buying.Wait till 15th May and results in karnatak will drive next move on sensex
214 2018-05-06 23:26:41 I think we had something similar in the 90s? Popcorn goes in the bottom, oil up on the top
215 2018-05-06 23:26:40 Why do bitches think coconut oil is the answer for everything?
216 2018-05-06 23:26:38 S-slather? With...oil?

219 2018-05-06 23:26:11 Emerging markets in #Asia have stronger #FX reserves and balance of payments buffers to absorb stronger $USD and US rates volatility, but key risk is oil at $80-85, increasing pressure on public finances $INR $IDR

225 2018-05-06 23:25:32 Okay google, show me kale
No, that's Christian Bale
I want something that 
Will make my blood boil
Not someone that's fat
And ugly, covered in oil
Show me the veg, crispy and strong
Eat kale all day long 
I must do it myself 
Google, good for nothing 
Look for kale on great Bing!
226 2018-05-06 23:25:11 PS I work for an oil and gas company, drive a car every day, use fossil fuel products every day and I still support climate action and transition to a green economy. Not everyone falls into the tiny societal boxes you've created in your mind

232 2018-05-06 23:24:11 I have Sunday scaries but I’m battling it with CBD oil, grilling pork ribs in a piri piri marinade, drinking a local beer, and listening to Sam Cook.
233 2018-05-06 23:23:52 50% chuck, 50% round, worchestershire sauce and a pinch of garlic. Grease grill with coconut oil.
234 2018-05-06 23:23:42 Laying in my tub hurts my neck I need to buy one of those tub pillows. Also I read CBD oil is legal in Utah now/soon. I want some of that
235 2018-05-06 23:23:36 CIA GHWB placed shah-Khomeini? so what happened next ?He also ran saddam Hussein & Saudis & Libya? OIL ?Now Russia can sell oil -need terror
236 2018-05-06 23:22:56 Next weekend I'm going to make him go to @Lowes and get an oil change kit for his mower so we be good next week
237 2018-05-06 23:22:45 Every child had to take the dreaded cod liver oil.... Boy I hated that stuff, and we ate plenty of dark leafy greens and other fresh veges. Perhaps it made a difference. I'm more concerned with children and childhood cancer which seems epidemic now.
238 2018-05-06 23:22:12 In a bowl, mix 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and 3 tablespoons of olive oil. Heat the solution for about 20 seconds in the microwave and soak your nails in it for 10 minutes. Do this every day
239 2018-05-06 23:21:55 8回は行かねば...
240 2018-05-06 23:21:50 I’ve been loooooving the organic belly balm from @Honest !! Works great on its own but I mix in a little Rejuveniqe oil intensive from Monat (basically a blend of different fruit and seed oils) and it’s been doing wonders for my skin!
241 2018-05-06 23:21:47 @SherryPollex What coconut oil do you use to make your lip gloss and/or your toothpaste?

I made all purpose cleaner today as well as allergy roll on using essential oils 
242 2018-05-06 23:21:44 Yes girl, start! And after that I moisturize with oil & leave in but Shea moisture has some good conditioners..the manuka honey is the best in my opinion.

244 2018-05-06 23:21:39 Good lawd!! I feel like I released stress the size of an elephant off of my shoulders.. feeling brand new! I think I need hot oil massages like errrr week lol
245 2018-05-06 23:21:31 Allah ya ki kan shi da rahama
246 2018-05-06 23:21:26 Adding a carbon tax etc and making the people closest to the oil pay more seems nuts. Just everything from Food to gas to houses to school seems way higher than it was not long ago. Stickers for cars have went way up. For the people paying 1.60 you would think they would help
247 2018-05-06 23:21:19 There were actually regional housing bubbles in the early 1990s (notably in California) - of course others avoided any housing bubble and popping for other reasons (i.e. Texas, whose real estate bubble was popped in the mid-late 80s with the oil downturn)
248 2018-05-06 23:21:11 Why wouldn’t we survive? Most likely because if you (Tom) lived then, you would die without the modern conveniences brought to you my oil and gas (and the products produced with them)
249 2018-05-06 23:21:11 Dude it’s all about how you season it. Some parsley, basil, and thyme w/ olive oil will make that broccoli way better. Cilantro and onion for the black beans, plus garlic.

254 2018-05-06 23:20:39 Gah dude buying CBD oil every month is ex-pen-siiiive
255 2018-05-06 23:20:16 ok i've another offer we will soak his balls in boiling oil 
256 2018-05-06 23:20:13 Also marchand does whatever it takes to win and he’s better than every winger the oil have at the moment. We’d be better off with him than the plug lucic on our top line
257 2018-05-06 23:20:06 Again, time value of money. I will happily rebuild a suspension yet will pay to get oil changed.
258 2018-05-06 23:19:56 20% cheaper next year. Year after that, another 20% cheaper. After 10 years? I know batteries aren't perfect but if you could trade them for oil and coal? Plus used batteries not good enough for cars still work for other things, like households where space, weight not an issue.
259 2018-05-06 23:19:39 Have you cavemen heard of the Chevy Bolt? It's all-electric, crossover SUV-sized, has a 238 mile range, and will never need an oil change or gasoline. It costs 7 bucks to charge the battery. You can find base models around 31,900 - plus there's a 7,500 tax credit. You're welcome.

271 2018-05-06 23:18:16 Just saying you gotta know your miles at the time of the oil change a lot of them put a sticker on the windshield lettin you kno when lol
272 2018-05-06 23:18:12 Keep the mosquitos away with a few drops of Eucalyptus Oil on your ankles &amp; wrists.
273 2018-05-06 23:18:12 True. Now that I think about it, you can probably replace the lost KJ with a perhaps a table spoon of olive oil.
274 2018-05-06 23:17:58 Ok, sure. But like. Why don’t you bring oil with your lamps? Why are lamps important? Why would the men come at midnight? Why would the wise women not hand over a bit of their oil? Why, Anna?????

282 2018-05-06 23:17:14 Olive oil at least??? C'mon??
283 2018-05-06 23:17:08 What constitutes worth though? Man City we’re poor last year, identified an area they needed to improve and sorted it out. They won the league, so surely he is worth it?

To be honest I’d take an oil billionaire buying us some success after the 30 odd years I’ve had as a fan.

292 2018-05-06 23:15:56 It wasn't a 'big deal' when a child got it in my childhood (50's). I read this; & we had to take it: Measles is highly contagious, but taking cod liver oil regularly will help prevent serious cases (it contains high amounts of natural vitamin A). Breastfeeding, is helpful.

301 2018-05-06 23:14:26 But... If oil gets really cheap, won't people want to turn back to gasoline? 
Besides, what about all the other stuff oil gets used for?

303 2018-05-06 23:14:21 Oil if traded below 69.70 then chances will be there of a lower retrace. But, looking at overall geopolitical I think it will still keep moving for $75. Thats a big resistance.

309 2018-05-06 23:13:55 I will say that in order to reach those  goals we’d have to curb usage worldwide. Arduous task to say the least. Until then, the MOST ethical oil is the best choice.

314 2018-05-06 23:13:28 It’s an art workshop built on classical training methods similar to those used in 19th century French schools. It will be a lot of observational and life drawing and oil painting. A lot of anatomy and high level foundational study.

332 2018-05-06 23:11:51 Don’t change the narrative - i don’t have the time get into the whole Canadian oil vs foreign oil discussion. I was merely pointing out the response by @misscanadajenn wasn’t relevant to the original post.

334 2018-05-06 23:11:26 "talks". its 20%? *building* to make things better. there are absolutely exceptions. 

fact remains most of the industry is just selling snake oil not improving the building of things.
335 2018-05-06 23:11:25 my mom told my bf and i to cook dinner so we can practice for when we move in together & needless to say it didn’t go well. the fire alarm went off, he spilt hot oil on his foot && i burnt the buns..

374 2018-05-06 23:04:14 @geography_411 Russia just like the US does not have a need for natural resources. They have a lust for cheap foreign oil they can bring home and sell for astronomical profits.
375 2018-05-06 23:04:07 Sure, absolutely.

So how about the same time frame? Can you foresee Dollar tanking against oil or copper or iron ore etc., during the same time frame it races up the Dollar Index?

443 2018-05-06 22:53:11 I feel your pain though, I had champagne aplenty on opening night on Thursday and now I have a burgeoning pimple on my forehead  I also sometimes take evening primrose oil and THAT makes your skin moisturized and gorgeous every time!
444 2018-05-06 22:53:01 What difference does it make if you get 50 miles a gallon when all the oil companies will do is raise the price of a gallon of gas to $10.00?
445 2018-05-06 22:52:58 The first bottom line was Kuwait.
The second was erroneous weapons of mass destruction that Bush demanded were there.
The third was to eliminate Sadam.
You skimmed right over the top of the alleged meaty reasons.
We didn't suck any oil worth mentioning out of Irag.
446 2018-05-06 22:52:51 Peppermint oil works wonders
447 2018-05-06 22:52:47 right? and like what about the many surgical suites where a pile of ash that used to be a circulating nurse or surgeon blows into the patient? nuclear power plants that lose their Homer? oil rigs that lose the guy who monitors the drill pressure?

449 2018-05-06 22:51:58 Fire Sessions lose the south, Fire SuckabeeSanders lose the evangelicals, Fire Pruitt lose the Oil people... from a friends convo with me last night... don’t see Pruitt going anywhere unless the IG report is horrible & goes viral. Let’s hope for that #resist
450 2018-05-06 22:51:50 #DRC doesn't have only diamonds but most importantly we have cobalt (60% of the world supply), copper (more than 40% of the world supply) and some untapped oil. Diamond doesn't represent that much. This picture has to be adjusted.

453 2018-05-06 22:50:38 Obama had  longest period of job growth in history after the deepest recession since the depression. With interest rates now spiking, oil prices soaring, job growth slowing, labor participation stuck at 63%, and $21 trillion record busting debt GOP better watch the hyperbole.

455 2018-05-06 22:50:29 Libya had the terrorism thing big time ..and shots at us.  But not strong aggression vs neighbors. Egypt was trying to overthrow him.

But at the time we chased him down, he wasn't threatening neighbors.  He was like Castro... with oil.
456 2018-05-06 22:50:12 Got scented plug in oil on me! now I smell like a damn Floral arrangement  
457 2018-05-06 22:50:10 Changing the oil on my truck pulled the plug drained all the oil went to take my filter off couldn’t get it and then realized I have no filter wrench.. how’s your day going?

460 2018-05-06 22:49:57 The push at the moment by the big oil producing countries to reduce supply in order to push up world prices is going to work to their detriment. It makes the development and use of alternate energy comparatively cheap. It will help to push the world to electric cars etc.

464 2018-05-06 22:49:08 Just imagine if Indonesia grew soy instead of palm oil. This demonizing of a crop shows a lack of understanding about what sustainability is about

 2 weeks ago, after most pundits predicted $100 #US #Oil was coming, #WTI fell 250 pt. Now everyone is talking about #Iran #sanctions and supply disruption. The history is likely to repeat itself.
466 2018-05-06 22:48:20 You would be better off with a filter. Just change it when your car gets an oil change.

471 2018-05-06 22:47:35 I always have to use natural coconut oil, aquaphor, or the plant. My skin is really sensitive and I always scar.
472 2018-05-06 22:47:26 Great stuff. I'm not totally in on #keto but I've been trying to minimize processed foods and refined carbs for a while. Little lifestyle type changes like cooking with coconut oil and trying to eliminate soda. Less rice has been the hard part- I love rice, brown & white.

478 2018-05-06 22:46:28 You know, eating healthy really sucks. I want to drown shit in butter and I have an unhealthy relationship with cheese. But I also really, really don’t want diabetes mellitus or a stroke so olive oil wins...for now.

484 2018-05-06 22:45:51 Even at macca pilgrimage they referred muslims as hindus. These nomadic arabs will only learn when they r out of oil. Once oil goes out no matter how beautiful cities they built may it be neom, dubai, qutar, kuwait etc no body is going to live in hot desert out there
485 2018-05-06 22:44:53 I figure that this civilization should be investing in its future by investing in innovative technology that leads progress to sustainability. Sooner or later this planet is going to run out of oil. It's not if but when.
486 2018-05-06 22:44:05 Jason Kenney and his CON circus are all about revenge and spite, that's all they offer. Rip it all down if it isn't about petrol dollars; ban it if the Koch Bros & US Republicans don't approve. He will make sure his "unapproved" charities get no funding, it all goes to big oil.
487 2018-05-06 22:43:58 Both parties are pro Big Pharma, pro oil companies, pro energy companies, pro war, pro greed. So not only do we need a third party we need a second party. We need multiple parties expressing multiple ideas. Both Republicans and Democrats have screwed American people long enough.

490 2018-05-06 22:43:40 This could be why  the Government of Sri Lanka is tightening its grip on the  lands around Mannar and Trincomalee.  Whether the benefits of  the gas and oil  resources would  benefit  the lives of the traditional  people of these areas,  is to be seen.

5. Can physically beat me up

525 2018-05-06 22:37:12 Maybe we need to start selling our own oil in our country instead of exporting to other countries. Take care of our needs first and tell OPEC to go FK themselves.

Sadaam invaded Iran... estimates are 200,000-500,000 killed.  Invaded Kuwait.  Gassed Kurds.  

He attacked Kuwait just to drive up oil price.  The Arab states should have smacked him (not us).
530 2018-05-06 22:36:46 The bar has unfortunately been in a culvert for a while. On the plus side, if it keeps digging lower it might strike oil, or unleash magma on the folks who keep going lower and lower. One can hope.

535 2018-05-06 22:35:48 Are you a conspiracy theorist or do you have some backdoor funding from the oil industry?  Your choice of a moniker makes it seem like you care about the environment when you really seem more interested in painting the people who do as "enemies of the state".

538 2018-05-06 22:35:28 It really isn't. Cannabis oil literally eats cancer. Distilled water neutralizes it. And ALL viruses. All our ills are man made. And tested on the battlefield prior. They've been trying to kill us off since the 16th century, but we keep giving them ideas. And they profit. Hugely.

562 2018-05-06 22:30:48 He got it from Putin. He started to get Russian money the same time he started hinting he'd run for President.

574 2018-05-06 22:27:26 Not at all, the available sources of renewables are well up to the task, all we have to do is stop wasting money on oil and gas infrastructure and start going renewables. 

Imagine all the money they waste drilling and spilling as fast as they can and then imagine it going green

587 2018-05-06 22:24:39 the sioux get no royalties the
pipeline running through their land.
oil's obsolete but the transition to 
100% renewables should serve
non-confrontational democracies.
in the interim, an oil pipeline can have
diplomatic bridge value.

590 2018-05-06 22:23:42 And neither are sustainable economies. The level of pollution from tar sands is extraordinary and can only lead to a faster collapse of the overall system. I don't know anything about deCaprio hell I can't even spell it. But the oil sands are a bad idea from the work go.

597 2018-05-06 22:22:55 Folks in AB will hire the @jkenney They are convinced @NDP are full of evil socialists. Pretty dumb. But there you go. You need to have a scrapegoat to blame when fracking increases oil production and leaves our product in the dumpster. I'm guessing the debt will increase in AB.
598 2018-05-06 22:22:28 Are coconut oil expiry dates a scam?

602 2018-05-06 22:22:12 An oil pipeline rupture in 2010 sent more than 1 million gallons of tar sands oil spilling into the Kalamazoo River. The pipeline company promised a full system inspection, but the government says it didn't do a thorough job. #ClimateChange (Collected from insideclimate)

604 2018-05-06 22:21:25 okay Robin whatever keeps you comfortable. Hicks and Icke =snake oil salesman, Brian Cox = bastion of truth. And "dead matter" formed life. And the earth is a spinning ball. There is no up or down in nature. Except on rockets on the way to the moon( = sphere reflecting sunlight).
605 2018-05-06 22:21:20 My partner made me the most wonderful conditioner today. Lavender and coconut oil with some other herbs. It got rid of my dandriff and left my skin and hair feeling so great. I love that man. :D

Look at the wars that have been fought over oil! Look at how many countries suffer without energy! Not in schools bcuz there'd be no slaves

623 2018-05-06 22:17:59 Are there stats on how much CO2 would be sequestered by the forest felled to make the palm oil, that would make the stats even worse one would think
624 2018-05-06 22:17:39 Soak in what? Salt water? oil? I tried fermenting in brine once. Tasted good but had a weird texture.

628 2018-05-06 22:16:57 Coal was beyond filthy, natural gas was billed as the cheaper cleaner alternative, it's another lie of the oil and gas industry. Leakage from distribution is something like 4 times what the industry says it is leaving natural gas just as bad if not worse than coal. 

Go Solar
629 2018-05-06 22:16:38 Anyone have any thoughts on the value of Six Sigma certification in oil/energy sector?

637 2018-05-06 22:15:02 I just went to Walmart and bought 2 gallons of canola oil and a three pound bag of candy. It was quite productive
638 2018-05-06 22:14:44 I've tried sulfate free shampoo, but the buildup of product and oil makes my roots look dirty all the time. Typically washing every 2-3 days is just right, using a little dry shampoo to put volume back in when I need it.
639 2018-05-06 22:14:37 My mans washed my Jeep yesterday, and then he checked and switched some fuses AND changed my oil today... I LOVE HIM

646 2018-05-06 22:13:11 facto de Uriburu. Durante su gestión al frente de la provincia acompaño tenazmente la política petrolera del Presidente Hipólito Yrigoyen, siendo uno de los principales enemigos de la empresa Standard Oil, tras su derrocamiento fue encarcelado y debió abandonar su provincia
647 2018-05-06 22:13:08 My man got me an oil change, car wash, fixed my phone, bought me a new case and screen protector, and bought me food. He offered to do all of this btw. I have an amazing man

651 2018-05-06 22:12:06 Everyone does. The lack of demand for oil during the recession is what causes it, not the other way around
652 2018-05-06 22:12:05 Never happen. This guy is obv long oil. Pump n dump.
653 2018-05-06 22:11:48 Hey @simonjbridges you know how you said  when you got the job that environment was top priority, and then you opposed restrictions on oil exploration which leads to climate pollution, and today you opposed limits on cow numbers which cause water pollution...
654 2018-05-06 22:11:43 As long republican state economies are dependent on fossil fuels  like those of West Virginia, Texas and Oklahoma they'll share Russia's interest in suppressing renewable energy development in order to maintain high oil prices. As for Nunes and Rohrbacher, they should move South,
655 2018-05-06 22:11:42 Watching people varnish their oil paintings is probably the most satisfying thing to watch. From seeing a dulled out piece, and then looking brand new after having the varnish applied, it's just simply amazing.

657 2018-05-06 22:11:25 If we refined oil here & used it as a business draw it might be worth it. But instead we export raw & charge 1/5th The royalties that Norway charges.
658 2018-05-06 22:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza for dinner today will be: moist crust with moist motor oil and chicken.
659 2018-05-06 22:10:50 I don't understand why Buffett invested in a bunch of them. Oil price going up...it won't be nice (or at least until Elon come out with a Tesla plane )
660 2018-05-06 22:10:49 I’m often happiest when I get to cook all day. Things I’ve made from #thefoodlab today: fresh ricotta which was first used for warm ricotta with olive oil and lemon zest then for classic baked ziti, the perfect easy red sauce for the ziti, and the best egg salad @kenjilopezalt
661 2018-05-06 22:10:47 As usual Mr turnbull u are out of touch. U have known most of our oil refineries are gone but now u are saying whats going on call a review.

665 2018-05-06 22:10:39 Most likely?  LOL. 

This isn't the Obama administration.  We slapped the most far reaching sanctions including reducing by 90% their oil imports.  This was 5 mos ago.

671 2018-05-06 22:09:55 That investment was list 18 months ago when oil prices dropped 
Obvious deception is not going to help your cause, Scheer!
672 2018-05-06 22:09:27 @browardpolitics and @GregGordon2 "If you don't want oil in your drinking water, you're a Russian spy." How can you call yourself a journalist? You should be ashamed.
673 2018-05-06 22:09:20 GOOD NEWS: Oil price rollback, nakaamba bukas #ACSBalita #DZRHNationwide @doe_ph
674 2018-05-06 22:08:54 They bet the house on oil, and oil went bust.  They also have had the problem of U.S. interference, but that is another story that goes back decades.  Still, Rubio was calling for regime change down there just the other day.  Kind of like what Russia wanted for us!
675 2018-05-06 22:08:51 Sure. Who cares if theres fecal matter in my ground beef. I probably wont be able to taste it. And why waste money on meds that work when i coulsld be buying untested snake oil w/ unlisted side effects? No need for rules. As long as the big corporations save money its all good.
676 2018-05-06 22:08:28 if u don’t dip your italian bread in olive oil and vinegar we can’t be friends.
677 2018-05-06 22:08:06 There are several clipping issues on Mirage and Train that I've emailed to Valve, such as the ladder on oil that were never addressed. The inability to get hit registry when someone is tabbed out of the game. Also when spawning sometimes the screen jitters.
678 2018-05-06 22:08:00 I was going to say - oil is the second thing on the ingredient list. But I have no idea about the characters. My Chinese only extends as far as TCM’s herbal pinyin. I tried learning the characters a couple times but that was WAY beyond me.

682 2018-05-06 22:07:09 The Ornish diet is often tounted as vegan, although I believe they allow egg whites and some low-fat dairy, so not truly vegan.Unlike a vegan diet, that doesn't restrict non-animal fat, like avocados & olive oil, the Ornish diet suggests eating very little fat. However, I think
683 2018-05-06 22:07:07 snake oil!
684 2018-05-06 22:06:55 I wish you could all be in my kitchen right now....no faulty (or fawlty) recipes here. Smells like cinnamon and nutmeg, and sounds like Gowan and Midnight Oil. It’s acceptable to dance whilst cooking in some cultures, isn’t it?
685 2018-05-06 22:06:47 History is not going to be kind to 1990-post-oil America.
686 2018-05-06 22:06:39 Lmaoo all the vegan stuff that meaning, the apple pie fries and hasbrowns are fried in the same oil, and only for those things
687 2018-05-06 22:06:36 Just buy like a coconut oil hair mask or something like that. Olive oil works too and let that soak in for about an hour and your hair will have little to no damage
688 2018-05-06 22:06:33 motor oil isnt for drinking

693 2018-05-06 22:05:23 Moratorium on fossil fuel infrastructure would include allowing the coal and oil burnng plants to die and have them replaced with wind and/or solar. Depending on your geography your power coud absolutely come from solar (probably works for 1/3 of the US).

695 2018-05-06 22:05:13 Plus there is zero evidence that McCain is smarter and more informed than Palin. Palin actually materially improved the lives of Alaskans with her oil policy. McCain materially improved only S and L bandits and arms merchants,
696 2018-05-06 22:05:12 Allot of Folks are  less fearful of refined oil in the pipes which they have had experience cleaning up than bitumen & solvent which they have no experience with.Would be a possible comprimise to the pipeline impasse

704 2018-05-06 22:04:12 I love how these Coca Cola commercials make it seem like their terrible soda is a great thing to drink and share with friends. I guess we’re supposed to ignore the fact it’s so corrosive it cleans rust off tools or oil off concrete? 
705 2018-05-06 22:04:06 So Lonny's grandma is ending her round 3 of chemo. She's 85 years old and this round is just too hard on her body. He picked her up some CBD oil and she's going to try that. I hope she continues to fight. She's the only grandma I've ever known and we love her!
706 2018-05-06 22:04:06 Who created the mullah regime in 1979? Who installed SaddamHussein to get rid of it again? USA is a geopolitical rogue state. Its not about peace, democracy or security. Never was. The whole thing is about securing control over oil on other peoples territory. Stop that!
707 2018-05-06 22:03:38 Milly too rock oil and flour.

719 2018-05-06 22:02:36 Burger: Pepper, paprika, cumin, garlic, truffle salt (and sometimes some olive oil and a local IPA to cook with too)
720 2018-05-06 22:02:29 As for Scotland not surviving on its own that’s extreme pish. Without Scotland’s oil and energy England would struggle. Your regions are in a bad way and the City is under pressure as your wealth generator following brexit
721 2018-05-06 22:02:25 अरे बाबा प्रगति तो करो,,तुम लोग तो भाई सत्युग लाना चाहते हो,,चमत्कार को ही नमस्कार में लगे हो,,हिन्दू मुस्लिम कर के अपनी रोटी बस सेक रहे,,जनता भो मूर्ख है तुम जैसे लोगो के बहकावे में आ जाती,, देश तभी आगे बढ़ेगा जब oil पर सब्सिडी देना शुरू करोगे,,रोज़गार के लिये कंपनी शिछा फ्री
722 2018-05-06 22:02:18 As fuel...yes, but you need a converter. As a replacement for the engine oil...no. Unless you WANT to destroy the engine, that qualifies as a Really. Bad. Idea. Veg. oil doesn't have the necessary viscosity.
723 2018-05-06 22:02:13 Luke's need for body oil is kinda disturbing
724 2018-05-06 22:02:10 this is a debate with logic at one end of the table, and unrestrained emotion at the other. only the smart among us recognize it's a no win outcome and should wait for the correct opportunity to speak.
725 2018-05-06 22:02:07 Not the results you were looking for I'm sure but I hope you had fun anyway. It was a thrill to see you run up here and I hope you'll come back. Best of luck.
726 2018-05-06 22:02:06 She really on twitter arguing over oil and birds lmaooooo someone come get their grandma pls
727 2018-05-06 22:00:58 It not really surprising at all
728 2018-05-06 22:00:58 takin care of your car is in style give that mf a tire check make sure you don’t need to change the oil make sure you got coolant so that whip stays icy
729 2018-05-06 22:00:53 "In areas that are most dependent on the global grain, seed, &oil market we have the largest food deserts. Those 2 phenomena are not unconnected. The Farm Bill has been built up around commodities; it needs to begin to address regional food systems."—@sustainableag's Ferd Hoefner
730 2018-05-06 22:00:46 Not a good idea to fry hashbrowns using sesame oil. Pa healthy ka pa ah.

733 2018-05-06 22:00:20 Never quit oil
734 2018-05-06 22:00:07 Just BOUGHT 1 @ 70 Crude Oil miNY Jun18 opening longs ▲$QM_F from my @iBroker iPhone App
735 2018-05-06 22:00:02 NBC LAMP OF LOVE is oil of man again! They mouth mattress “sources” which are constantly rubber. Rag is, dislike so few others, the sources probably don’t blow some ass, they are puta, shit! NBC, my latter pants pusher with the Vagina, is now as bull gravy as Horns-To-Sell..
736 2018-05-06 22:00:01 USA created the MullahRegime in 1979 and installed SaddamHussein to get rid of it again. Worked fine. NOT.  USA is a geopolitical rogue state. Stop protecting your ressources on other peoples territory and claim its all for safety, democracy and peace. Its all for oil. As always.
737 2018-05-06 22:00:00 Also: That is just filled with hot oil.
738 2018-05-06 21:59:53 Cleansing your face with coconut oil is the best feeling ever 
739 2018-05-06 21:59:51 The bogus tax cut is gone for everyday Americans. It went bye bye w/increased gas prices & oil. Do u know how many products are made w/oil. Here comes the inflation there goes the pocket money from tax cut. Shamefully pathetic promise
740 2018-05-06 21:59:46 i got some weed oil for that
741 2018-05-06 21:59:35 Great point Erika. But the only 10 I am is 10 inches deep in your mom. Now show me where it says “oil” in that article. Last time I checked, birds don’t perch up on poles placed vertically in the ground.
742 2018-05-06 21:59:23 What do these idiots think the #2nd is for?
Hunting game?
It's for hunting alright. 
Hunting tyranny.
743 2018-05-06 21:59:13 I’m high maintenance. I use $100 face moisturizer and put Moroccan oil in my hair. 
744 2018-05-06 21:59:11 I told my son the other day that I hate feminism. He asked why. I said because I was born superior, and I'll be damned if I want a downgrade. He went "What?" I said, "Who made your liver?" 
745 2018-05-06 21:59:09 A drop of olive oil rubbed nightly into your nails will help them grow long and strong.
746 2018-05-06 21:59:02 Just changed my first flat tire and I feel more manly than ever. About to go and do more manly things like: cut down a tree, shoot some guns, perform an oil change, unnecessarily hold in my feelings and emotions until they’re released in an unhealthy way
747 2018-05-06 21:59:01 You have raised our taxes, added a carbon tax, spent us into oblivion and you believe you are helping Albertans as you crush Oil Companies.  GONE 2019
748 2018-05-06 21:58:53 I’ve seen the science projects. They use far more oil than a bird would be exposed to in this scenario. It would be a contact transfer from a trace source. A source, mind you, birds are unlikely to touch with their feathers.
749 2018-05-06 21:58:43 Cold-brew parkour at the oil refinery
750 2018-05-06 21:58:43 No s**ts given
751 2018-05-06 21:58:42 Lastly Port Harcourt people need to wake up!! We have oil yet we're lagging.
752 2018-05-06 21:58:34 Brake pads, oil change, tire all that shit 
753 2018-05-06 21:58:22 Except charter schools and the oil& as industry, no consulting there, just dictatorial arrogance.
754 2018-05-06 21:58:15 I tan sooo fast with coconut oil
755 2018-05-06 21:58:12 Try lifting your hair at the roots and drying them first,then let the rest air dry. If your hair is super thick and you just let it air dry moisture stays closer to the scalp creating dandruff and oil.
756 2018-05-06 21:58:11 I think I may actually got the tiniest bit of sun today finally:-) only took about 5 layers of tanning oil
757 2018-05-06 21:57:50 Turkey can not buy isis oil at the present time look at the  map ...  in the past they may purchased some oil same as ypg and esad bought oil from isis too.  we all know that oil, war and blood is usa and uk s profession. Now dont talk about OIL...... libya, iraq, etc......
758 2018-05-06 21:57:39 Coconut oil, crystals, cucumber infused alkaline water, a joint, Prince on repeat...MOOD all summer 18 

759 2018-05-06 21:57:35 おしごとぉ
760 2018-05-06 21:56:58 Things are under control!!!!! I got the guy at the oil change place to teach me how to fix it in case something like this happened
761 2018-05-06 21:56:55 psa: don't use vegetable oil to tan. ever.
762 2018-05-06 21:56:51 Finally got an oil change 
763 2018-05-06 21:56:44 Low carb days are not bad because I get to eat like 85 grams of fat so much avocado and coconut oil
764 2018-05-06 21:56:25 About his face being smeared with motor oil 
765 2018-05-06 21:56:18 So glad @BlippiOfficial has a video on plumbing and checking the oil in a car. It's about time this freeloading 2 year old of mine picked up a trade and started contributing to the goldfish fund. That's a good age for a first job, right?
766 2018-05-06 21:56:16 More like OPEC’s and Saudi Arabia’s fault (KSA is chair of OPEC rn) for limiting oil supply as well as US petrol stations switching to the more expensive summer blend, as they often do in the spring
767 2018-05-06 21:55:57 But you don't have a standing army. You have few energy resources and a lot of vehicles. You will have to import your oil. Do you really have a surplus? Every industry you have is oil dependant. You need to think that statement through.
768 2018-05-06 21:55:51 Help my hands are on fire after spilling chili oil
769 2018-05-06 21:55:50 Yep! I also make bruschetta with them. Spread thick sliced bread with olive oil on one side and toast both sides under a broiler, place tomato slices, then basil and some fresh mozzarella on top and broil until melted. Favorite summer treat.
770 2018-05-06 21:55:46 I can taste the peanut oil in these fries. I am also allergic to peanuts 
771 2018-05-06 21:55:43 Your images show obsolete technology or literal snake oil salesmen with the caption 'PoS'; with your own business model running on PoW tech, it thus suggests that you are spreading FUD.

How not to do social media 101 over here, ladies and gents.
#Cryptocurrency #Mining #PoS #PoW
772 2018-05-06 21:55:42 Just being curious, how do you extract carrot oil and what is it used for?
773 2018-05-06 21:55:40 Aaron Wise who finished T-2 to Jason Day in the Wells Fargo Championship today is the same guy won the Mackenzie Tour - PGA Tour Canada Syncrude Oil Country Championship at Edmonton's Glendale Golf Country Club just two years ago.
774 2018-05-06 21:55:23 Going long on snake oil right now.
775 2018-05-06 21:55:21 You can not Drink OIL or continue to DESALT THE OCEAN WATERS. Saudi Arabia must come to its senses of die or thirst. One attack on your Desalting Plants will bring you to your knees. We no longer need your OIL.
776 2018-05-06 21:55:21 It’s melted coconut oil season.
777 2018-05-06 21:55:17 Brazilian style so all recipes are merely guidelines: 1 tablespoon of minced fresh garlic probably about 8 cloves, olive oil, 1 tablespoon of kosher salt, 1/3 tablespoon of black pepper. This should be enough for 2-3 New York Strip steaks.
778 2018-05-06 21:55:08 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
779 2018-05-06 21:55:06 Ohh I used this mist this morning. I never have any problem with it at all. Shane you didn’t get on with it. I also have the @StTropezTan oil, that might work better for you. £3 in TKMaxx 
780 2018-05-06 21:54:19 Corey, your great country created the mullah regime in 1979. Then USA installed SaddamHussein in Iraq to clean up. That worked so well. NOT. Your country is a geopolitical rogue state. Greedy for oil and protecting its ressources on other peoples territory. Nothing else.
781 2018-05-06 21:54:09 Second round of duck confit, shaved fennel with hazelnut oil and yuzu, mashed potatoes, and a lighter, modern Dão.
782 2018-05-06 21:54:00 Coconut oil>>>> 
783 2018-05-06 21:53:59 Horgan took advantage of the pipeline debacle to support the enhancement opportunities for BC rail's activities within the oil & gas industry. Never trust a hypocrite.
784 2018-05-06 21:53:56 اكيد فاهمه الفرق بين احتضنها ، واحضنها 
785 2018-05-06 21:53:53 my last tweet on this
1- Ok backed makes more sense
2- Endogenous oils are diff type & location
3- These are 5-7” backyard birds. Wee feathers. Proving oil gloms together barbs is the stuff of a kid’s science project
4- Makes more sense to use an alternative
786 2018-05-06 21:53:46 Things that become precious in band:

- water
- pencils
- sanity*
- water
- valve oil
- slide/cork grease
- water

** sanity: no one has it so it's rare and valuable enough to trade it for every other idea on the list
787 2018-05-06 21:53:37 I’ll never come to  dumb ass @Walmart for an oil change ever again 
788 2018-05-06 21:53:25 Carrot oil?? 
How about onion oil?
789 2018-05-06 21:53:21 every preacher selling snake oil can find it tough to shift the first few bottles
790 2018-05-06 21:53:11 Yaz more than buying Bernini y'all could have bought some Vaseline or maybe fish oil for those ashy hands
791 2018-05-06 21:52:51 $15K kitchen fire at Christies Beach overnight. Oil was left cooking on the stove #adelaide #novanews
792 2018-05-06 21:52:15 ‘Oil, water and a third unmeshable thing’ ...name it? #buffythevampireslayer #wordslayage #watchingclassics
793 2018-05-06 21:52:13 Praying this coconut oil helps my hair 
794 2018-05-06 21:52:09 You also have treasonous actors pocketing said ME oil money and living the good life around the world.  They don’t like their countries or their own citizenry.  A new Dark Age is potentially upon Europe
795 2018-05-06 21:52:04 And I chucked a mix of rose hip oil and regular supermarket vitamin e moisturiser on my body and that was pretty good too
796 2018-05-06 21:51:58 Steve, the images you posted suggest that PoS is a gimmick, a fake, a snake oil, etc... What other message could it have suggested? 

I'm asking this as a potential customer.
797 2018-05-06 21:51:57 She only has five stones. WHERE IS THE OIL WELL STONE?!?!?
798 2018-05-06 21:51:51 You don’t think our oil having a (23%) rate of return this time two years ago or a (3%) rate this time last year while Texas oil consistently had a ~48% rate of return over those 2 years might have influenced some decisions?
799 2018-05-06 21:51:23 《オリーブ油豆知識》
オリーブ油は オレイン酸が腸の刺激を促してくれるため、便秘解消効果がある
800 2018-05-06 21:51:08 Weed is better simpson oil 4 example is what killed my cancer but big parma doesnt make money off that and smokes make 2 much money and alcohol makes 2 much money through dui's and overcrowded jails and prisons to the point it will never change even tho weed should be the legal 1
801 2018-05-06 21:51:02 وانت طيب وبالف خير واسرتك بخير وسعاده
802 2018-05-06 21:50:49 Oil money. Pep's bald. Fraudiola hahaha. Nasri is still a cunt. @ me you little wanker
803 2018-05-06 21:50:33 Get it really really hot. Cover it in vegetable oil. Wire brush. More oil. More heat. More brush. If very greasy wipe with oil and paper towels.
804 2018-05-06 21:50:25 I was so desperate to fix my dry husk of a face that I started to use a bottle of rose hip oil that’s been sitting in my cabinet for at least a year. It works! I also like using a dermalogica ‘skin hydrating’ masque when I remember
805 2018-05-06 21:50:23 That is what most people almost always fail to understand. The so called Lagos economy is tied to oil economy.
806 2018-05-06 21:50:21 خدایی اینو چجوری oil خونده:)))
807 2018-05-06 21:50:15 I wish someone would of told me I’d look 60 at 49 when I was laying on blacktop with iodine and baby oil. 
808 2018-05-06 21:50:07 I'm surprised more people aren't angry about this. Given the level of precision involved in taking a tea or coffee order why would people suddenly feel so free with the vinegar/oil mix, which can easily be bottled / vessel-ed and carried to the table for the customer to decide.
809 2018-05-06 21:50:02 Literally block the sun out of your life and make sure that your skin stays hydrated! I like Asian style beauty regimes, they’re easier for my skin. Oil cleansing then soap then toner, essence, emulsion, serum, locked in by an occlusive!
810 2018-05-06 21:49:45 Every month I'm trying a new lotion, or oil, or cleanser, or scrub, in an effort to make my skin pop. I don tire abeg, make the skin dey as e dey.
811 2018-05-06 21:49:43 USA created the Mullahregime in 1979 and then installed #SaddamHussein in #Iraq to clean up the mess. I'd say your country owes the iranian and iraqi people reparations. USA does not fight for peace or demoracy there. Its all about bloody oil and controlling ressources.
812 2018-05-06 21:49:38 There’s so many skin care things i want from @BahiCosmetics but can’t have bc ya girl has a sensitivity to argan oil 
813 2018-05-06 21:49:36 It's all about the avocado and coconut oil these days though... #GoodFats #SoVegan #MyBodyIsATemple

818 2018-05-06 21:48:48 Oil prices go up #jobsecurityfordomesticRigCrews
819 2018-05-06 21:48:41 Funny how years of conservative governments failed to conserve any savings during triple-digit oil prices.

820 2018-05-06 21:48:36 My boss has them and says they can be a pain because you have to sand them, oil them, and bacteria can get caught in any small cracks.
821 2018-05-06 21:48:30 Not the baby oil, the videos 
822 2018-05-06 21:48:19 Its ok, its 200% pure organic almond oil. He's nutty as ever.
823 2018-05-06 21:48:09 
824 2018-05-06 21:48:04 I bought two things of coconut oil just to find out I have low porosity hair and coconut oil don’t do a damn thing for low porosity hair 
825 2018-05-06 21:47:51 Oil is not mentioned here. Vasoline is, but they’re not the same thing.
826 2018-05-06 21:47:50 Some greek salad, hot garlic bread with extra virgin Olive oil. Yummy eats.
827 2018-05-06 21:47:25 Damn, I don’t think I’ve ever been less interested in the feelings of Ron Perlman
828 2018-05-06 21:47:09 Imported oil hitting the east ports has no carbon tax applied to it ...most goes to Quebec..hmmmmm
829 2018-05-06 21:46:47 Want to know something about Lex Luthor? He's bald like Mr.Clean. He uses baby oil to shine his bald head.
830 2018-05-06 21:46:46 Use palm oil and sugar....lol
831 2018-05-06 21:46:43 Excellent TWEET!
832 2018-05-06 21:46:39 Putting peppermint oil in my conditioners be feeling so bomb on my scalp
833 2018-05-06 21:46:29 わーーーーーーーいいなーーーーーーー
834 2018-05-06 21:46:21 Exfoliate your life and top it off with some Coconut Oil or Shea Butter
835 2018-05-06 21:46:20 What information did I pull out of my ass exactly? The fact that there would be so little oil that the effects on the birds would be negligible? That’s how the effectiveness of quantities works.
836 2018-05-06 21:46:18 They don’t seem to grasp this fact...
837 2018-05-06 21:46:18 We talking treason. What would a man do to hide being a traitor? Those who would cover such a man must be complicit or well compensated. The beginning of our Story is not Trump Tower Moscow. Chump change. Rosneft. Magnitsky Act. Now we talking. Real Billionaires.Oil is the prize.
838 2018-05-06 21:46:08 Instead, the media, but don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
839 2018-05-06 21:46:06 People buying the engine oil in bulk
840 2018-05-06 21:45:57 Peanut oil and finish with scallions and salt unless your sauce has enough salt in it
841 2018-05-06 21:45:36 The crap I learned at highschool. I was told oil comes from dead leaves and animals long time ago. Crap.

Oil and natural gas comes from inside the lava stream forced upwards starting as methane gas liquified as oil during cooling. For us gasguzzlers, oil will never run out.
842 2018-05-06 21:45:34 Can't survive without my CBD oil.

846 2018-05-06 21:45:10 Ty, this is a great development for Somailand and Ethiopia - Two peaceful nations seeking a new democratic commercial partnership. Once is oil is discovered - this deal will be the bases for the future financial and political independence of Somaliland. There is no looking back.

Having the anointing doesn't excuse you having a bad attitude. You might have the oil, but you might also need an oil change.

850 2018-05-06 21:44:01 Once I get my oil changed, my coolant replaced, my tires rotated, get my speedometer and odometer working, figure out how to close the driver side door fully, fix my breaks, and stop my car from leaking any time it rains, it's over for all yall

863 2018-05-06 21:42:06 But u mischievously singled out Osun for ridicule while your state despite its oil producing status was also owing
864 2018-05-06 21:41:58 Such a loyal and dedicated gentlemen officer cadet. May Allah bless and forgive his soul.

866 2018-05-06 21:41:04 My boilerplate response: Science has produced an explanation for what is occurring. If you have a better explanation, the oil industry will make you filthy rich. Go for it.
867 2018-05-06 21:41:03 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.
868 2018-05-06 21:41:02 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
869 2018-05-06 21:40:50 Obama set out to destroy America, building on the greedy crooks before him who got payola to close down pipelines, gas and coal leaving us dependent on foreign oil.. share that with your 10 followers!

871 2018-05-06 21:40:31 미국은 북한핵에 완전히 겁을 먹었었나 보다. 완전 비핵화를 곱씹고 있다. 싸우지 않으려면 서로의 마음을 녹여야 한다. 따슨 가슴에는 정이 넘친다. 한국인은 정 많은 사람들이다. 미국은 이 정부터 배워야힌다. 이에는 이 칼에는 칼 이런 따위로는 안된다. 언 몸에는 정담긴 뚝배기 해장국이 최고다

874 2018-05-06 21:40:13 Big oil wants the carbon tax so their fight against it is going against the very business they spend their days ass kissing to. They really aren't too bright.
875 2018-05-06 21:40:11 Before storing - of it is a new pan re-season. Everyone has their own "special" oil some use vegetable, lard, Cisco, oil, peanut etc...all are fine. Lodge Cast Iron is the only type I use and their web site is awesome and has step by step foot treating all your pans. 2l,2
876 2018-05-06 21:40:08 "now, I'm not willing to do this much longer"

877 2018-05-06 21:40:04 Ya know what? Fuck it, Luna’s gonna plop her naked rump in a lawn chair on her back patio and stroke a thick load out for old time’s sake.

She’s got her body oil and she’s already pouring it and going to town on her meat.
878 2018-05-06 21:40:02 My skin absorbs oil so quickly. 
879 2018-05-06 21:39:56 Hanzi its a new ZANU, just like putting new oil in a dead car woti it's now a brand new car

881 2018-05-06 21:39:33 if you pay for oil or tire changes, WTF IS WRONG W U
882 2018-05-06 21:39:16 Combine that with the couple of gallons of used oil and the old car batteries you gave yesterday up by Momma Soulas yesterday. You're some boy Dooley
883 2018-05-06 21:39:15 Snake oil salesmen like @Franklin_Graham have no moral compass.
884 2018-05-06 21:39:14 Made up I swerved bifters but this leccy cig is a nightmare tbh. Making sure it's charged carrying the oil for it proper effort.
885 2018-05-06 21:38:59 Whatever has oil is America
886 2018-05-06 21:38:52 Now that I know @cantubeauty has products that are paraben, silicone, sulfate, and mineral oil free I can save some money 
887 2018-05-06 21:38:35 Please note that most of that demand is smuggled from Venezuela to its neighbours (T&T, Colombia, A B C Islands and Brasil)...Is not real Venezuelan oil consumption or demand.
888 2018-05-06 21:38:20 No more coconut oil for the bullpen. Rosin only.
889 2018-05-06 21:38:15 if youre going to use a pressure washer on wood, be careful not to use it on high settings as it will damage the wood
890 2018-05-06 21:38:13 Oh hey, shocker. @Franklin_Graham is a partisan snake oil salesman like his dad. What a f’ing hypocrite. Would be amazing if one day he actually broke free of his narcissistic ego & started helping people.
891 2018-05-06 21:37:48 Super! USA created the Mullah Regime in 1979, then installes #SaddamHussein to clean up the CIA mess. Worked. NOT. USA does not want peace nor democracy. All Trump wants is controlling the oil to make america great again (as always with stolen resources and blood of other people)
892 2018-05-06 21:37:42 Get some oil for that revolving door on the off day tomorrow.
893 2018-05-06 21:37:24 i’m boutta chug this bottle of cbd oil idgaf!!!
894 2018-05-06 21:37:19 "keep yourself sane" => do not lose sight of YOU

that is not to be confused with the terribly similar (at least on the surface) statement "keep yourself [the] same"
for you see the former is a simple and agreenent
and the later is the foundations of a prison
895 2018-05-06 21:37:11 If the AB govt had said "no" to dilution since it's environmentally dangerous we'd not be in this situation now, and a lot more oil jobs would be in AB instead of Texas and Louisiana.
896 2018-05-06 21:36:26 The entire decision making displayed by #trump admin has been disturbing, but to kill #iran nuclear on a known false fact / lie is complete BS.. prepare for the temp boost to our oil but dammit nuclear is fundamentally safer / more efficient than other current sources of energy
897 2018-05-06 21:36:16 Is coconut lacroix good or taste like tanning oil? I can’t decide. So I keep drinking it.
898 2018-05-06 21:36:12 Wtf Daniel
899 2018-05-06 21:35:58 Wow - just saw a commercial for the American Petroleum Institute, a huge oil lobbying firm, while waiting for The Avengers to start at @RegalMovies
900 2018-05-06 21:35:53 I dropped oil on my fuckng hand and it burns
901 2018-05-06 21:35:44 When the tarsands were first mined in the 70s they partially refined the bitumen to "Syncrude" then it could be piped just like conventional oil. But the oilcos would rather dilute it and refine in southern US where they have spare capacity.
902 2018-05-06 21:35:23 Very simple - after use you you can clean it with warm water and a soft cloth. After you fry it and recoat it with oil. I let mine sit on the stove for a bit till the oil absorbs like 10 mins then I store. Never use soap or a harsh cloth. Always make sure it is dry ,1/2
903 2018-05-06 21:35:19 @Alyssa_Milano Because it will never end, police will kill, and the criminal underground will still have all the guns they will ever need. You probably believe all these wars we've fought is about terrorism? It's about drugs and oil. Please wake up. You're smarter than this.
904 2018-05-06 21:35:16 Black Castor Oil is just so amazing
905 2018-05-06 21:35:09 "Reinflate the balloon with just fifty-three bottles of olive oil, a waffle iron and a long-running Stargate in-joke? You're crazy."
906 2018-05-06 21:35:06 Just finished changing the oil in my car.
907 2018-05-06 21:35:06 A freshening facial mask, pastel cobalt blue, with beetle mica, rosewood oil, and exfoliating microspheres. It's sold as a brick wrapped in paper.

909 2018-05-06 21:34:43 Those countries are bought and paid for from Middle Eastern oil money.  It’s the refugee privilege now over there
910 2018-05-06 21:34:33 Haha awesome, thanks man! I figured - if I'm going to ever see what it's like to have a beard - grad school is the time to do it!
I think I need to get some beard oil, though...
911 2018-05-06 21:34:05 His little hands are all covered in oil now.
912 2018-05-06 21:34:02 High voltages, naked flames, oil, no safety gear... possibly... no wait... actually the most dangerous video I have seen on YouTube!
913 2018-05-06 21:33:43 If you’re hair is dry a lot you should look into hot oil treatments. Also conditioning may not be the problem. It could be the way you’re brushing your hair as well
914 2018-05-06 21:33:41 The oil companies refine 83-85 octane gasoline. Ethanol is a cheap octane booster and oxygenate. Replaced toxic MTBE. It’s the perfect fuel additive and it’s good for local economies!
915 2018-05-06 21:33:36 I hope oil goes to $120 a barrel. I have mineral rights in 2 horizontal wells on my land outside of Era,Texas with Energy ,Oil & Gas . I pray the Lord will bless me where I can bless my grandchildren.
916 2018-05-06 21:33:34 And when you fill your tank with gasoline, better hope the oil didn't  come from Saudi Arabia, where the ringleader of the 9/11 attacks came  from. Happy self-righteous indignation y'all!
917 2018-05-06 21:33:24 In 1979 USA accidentally installed the mullah regime in Iran and then installed SaddamHussein to clean up. USA does not want a strong free and democratic Iran. USA wants your oil, not peace. Should Iran end up like Iraq, Libya or even worse?
918 2018-05-06 21:33:09 And when you fill your tank with gasoline, better hope the oil didn't come from Saudi Arabia, where the ringleader of the 9/11 attacks came from. Happy self-righteous indignation y'all!
919 2018-05-06 21:33:02 Olive oil and sea salt.
920 2018-05-06 21:33:01 So you put the pravana on then put plastic on your head and blow dry it for like 20 minutes. Then when you go to wash it out scrub it like you’re getting stains out. After both sessions I put coconut oil in my hair and slept and I used dawn with my shampoo to get the oil out
921 2018-05-06 21:33:00 I wish you could try my improvised @RanchoGordo cassoulet beans with smoked pork butt, shallots, garlic, olive oil, and fresh chives and sage from the pots on my deck that survived the awful winter. Because you’d like it.
922 2018-05-06 21:32:55 But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face,

923 2018-05-06 21:32:54 Seconded. Coated in oil and honey.
924 2018-05-06 21:32:40 No you need to put condition and a dab of oil in it, bring it to a boil and put it in

926 2018-05-06 21:32:28 WD40? No I didn’t but it explains a LOT about fish oil
927 2018-05-06 21:32:16 I need a damn oil change.
928 2018-05-06 21:32:16 Ok. I don’t have the dents, but if you can find some emu oil it helps for the...is it scarring? IDK, but I had marks from the underwires of my oil bras and got them to fade. 
929 2018-05-06 21:31:58 Not since they went from frying in tallow to whatever unholy vegetable oil they started using. Anyway, I was referring to health, not flavor.

932 2018-05-06 21:31:22 That is a feature, not a bug.  No better way to keep the oil companies making large donations ...well, other than getting rid of gas efficiency and other environmental regulations.

935 2018-05-06 21:30:56 Our squirrels are persistent.  They eventually wore the oil off.
936 2018-05-06 21:30:56 It's tough in PA, hope you do better next time
937 2018-05-06 21:30:45 Yes. The Tory tweet pictured blamed socialism, in this case lorry driver strikes, for damaging the economy in 1973. It wasn't strikes, or the Tory govt. It was the oil crisis. 
Do you understand?
938 2018-05-06 21:30:35 I did that once too. Lots of fun. But the varmints just keep doing it until they've wiped off all the oil. They are almost undefeated

943 2018-05-06 21:30:05 Absolutely. Even with more omega6 vs omega 3, the total amount of omega6 in a serving of red meat is extremely low. It can easily be offset by supplementing with quality fish oil or just eating fatty fish
944 2018-05-06 21:30:02 Did you know that is made from fish oil?
945 2018-05-06 21:29:57 Galveston would be a nice lil’ spot to pop out to every now and then if the water wasn’t 85% crude oil.

950 2018-05-06 21:29:12 Guessing that’s sarcasm, but if not...A flat tax is a massive giveaway to the wealthy, in the province with the lowest corporate tax rates already. Oil is still a volatile commodity, subject to whims beyond our control. Its a shameless giveaway that will hurt the working class.

954 2018-05-06 21:28:56 4.9 is weak, but significant enough to make you think.  

By the way, is this possibly oil related?
955 2018-05-06 21:28:48 I know Strzok is no oil painting, but seriously he was cheating on his wife with that
956 2018-05-06 21:28:41 Oh nah, I don’t even use much, sometimes just tresemme conditioner as a leave in and some oil if my hair super dry. Only now I’m on a new product journey but tresemme works best for me than any other thing I’ve found

970 2018-05-06 21:25:22 Why is everyone and they mom getting their oil changed
971 2018-05-06 21:25:14 they prolly TESTING their soap on baby ducks, why a duck needa be washed? stay woke

972 2018-05-06 21:25:12 Except we have the most environmentally friendly regulations of any oil producing nation on earth
973 2018-05-06 21:25:01 We will be different we have oil.
974 2018-05-06 21:24:57 Literally just here while Nick gets his oil change done. I could be doing what I'm doing here at home and at least then I'd be binging something on Netflix and having carne asada. I'm so frustrated.
975 2018-05-06 21:24:55 While I'm here lol ! Question... is it okay/good to use shea butter only or it's better to accompany it with another oil ?

981 2018-05-06 21:23:29 I have no good advice except maybe red wine and lavendar oil
982 2018-05-06 21:23:27 Thanks for admitting you gave all the money to the rich and corporations. You also gave the Oil Industry rescue money they did not need.

989 2018-05-06 21:22:22 I mean "drug" and "essential oil" get really confusing with some things, but in this case nicotine in vape juice is basically the same as the essential oil varieties. At least the medically safe kind. It's suspended in at least food grade PV.
990 2018-05-06 21:22:08 It's been more than three years since #WTI posted a 10 dollar move from its open in a given month. This is the longest such drought since 2005, when oil made its initial move into these higher ranges. My guess is we are due and such a move in May means we see 78.53. Yikes. #OOTT

997 2018-05-06 21:20:45 Once again, you are lobbying for big oil on a topic that has absolutely nothing to do with selling oil to Asia. This isn’t about domestic consumption, it’s about consumption all the way around the planet in Asia...that you’re lobbying for us to ship through Metro Vancouver!
998 2018-05-06 21:20:26 If emission are such a problem why did Alan Lloyd scale back the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate? 

CA had electric cars and the government, headed by the Democrats, caved to oil and car companies.
999 2018-05-06 21:20:09 it’s like changing an oil filter but on a person and really that’s fine
1000 2018-05-06 21:20:05 fish oil is amazing, and i found that vit D and multi helped me so much living there not having the sun. being where it’s always sunny now and i’m outside a lot with smalls it definitely helps. i also recommend looking into aromatherapy.

1005 2018-05-06 21:19:32 Should be able to grow your own. Screw having to buy a plant you can grow. It’s bullshit if you can’t. You can make craft beer . So the same should be for weed. People can make #finewine type of deal for boutique weed. I’m not saying snake oil but you can sale candy.
1006 2018-05-06 21:19:25 In other none positive news #TinaTheCortina is still leaking oil. Yep second main rear seal replacement has failed too. So now it’s a a major job taking it to bits & send crank off or new block, so yeah big job either wau 
1007 2018-05-06 21:19:24 One reason that not getting on a PhD course and having to get a job instead is that then I could afford to waste money on shit like expensive Italian hazelnuts in honey at m&s and expensive extra virgin olive oil
1008 2018-05-06 21:19:12 When you you got an oil change and went grocery shopping all before 10am. Then studied with no nap. 

Miracles really do happen
1009 2018-05-06 21:19:11 This reminds me   of  a similar   incident   that happened  ,i was  13 yrs old  .The truck overturned  and there was sunlight bar soap and fish oil,the streets became sunlight  ,sadobha boxes and boxes of soap.  Fish oil it was in  20 liters  ....it was Christmas...
1010 2018-05-06 21:19:03 Check your facts and history. The oil industry was nationalized in 1975 during Carlos Andrés Perez’s first presidency

1012 2018-05-06 21:18:32 oil companies have been shutting down refineries in Oz for decades, I worked in 2 in NSW, they know there is no profit in refining unless it is on a huge scale or is subsidised
1013 2018-05-06 21:18:30 I used Coconut oil, it works just as good but it dries up faster. Vasaline prob feels way worse
1014 2018-05-06 21:17:56 Bruh these tv commercials are So0oO inaccurate about health... No, dairy milk is not necessary for kids to grow, and no, corn oil is not healthier than olive oil. God forbid ppl use canola oil. You ever heard of a conola plant?
1015 2018-05-06 21:17:35 Coconut oil is

Okay then...

1019 2018-05-06 21:16:50 As I mentioned, I'm in Canada. Western Canada, which has both oil and agriculture energy based economy.
We get people like Leonardo flying in on his private jet, film something with our Aboriginal peoples saying "tar sands are bad", then fly out on his private jet. Hypocrisy.
1020 2018-05-06 21:16:46 Fish, rice, and greens. He doesn't have vegetable oil so I fried the fish in sticks of margarine lmao. It came out so good. Luckily he has a ton of seasonings.
1021 2018-05-06 21:16:30 Why do I ever bother putting coconut oil on,my dog always ends up licking it off 
1022 2018-05-06 21:16:24 .@checkupcbc
Can't avoid politics of #climatechange denial, former premier wall at #UCPAGM after taking a job for the law firm representing #KinderMorgan, won't shave until #carbontax defeated. Are we a petro state or not? Will big oil pay for flooding damage? Or wall? #cdnpoli
1023 2018-05-06 21:16:17 Moreover unfooled... But in the snake oil business. #FakeNews
1024 2018-05-06 21:16:10 With "treat" in inverted commas.. and palm oil everywhere :)
1025 2018-05-06 21:16:00 Tbh I’m not sure about avocado oil I only use that to moisturize my skin. I would say check online.
1026 2018-05-06 21:15:58 When you put different things into a rice cooker you have to adjust how much water you add. I also cook lentils & pasta in there and adding oil can prevent things from sticking to the ground
1027 2018-05-06 21:15:50 No, by promoting this activity even though your not in the pipeline business, the oil tanker business and you’re not in Asia buying Alberta bitumen...you’re lobbying for big oil and I obviously, because I live where these oil tankers will pass, am not.
1028 2018-05-06 21:15:30 What an amazing achievement,winning the league with a team owned by an oil rich country and spent billions in doing so,as I said”what an achievement”
1029 2018-05-06 21:15:21 I don't think the art of wooing is lost. I think the interpretation of what wooing means has become an abstract and contemporary fiasco. Wooing never disappeared. The method degenerated. It's the difference between oil painting and crayon drawing. Most reach for the cheap crayon.
1030 2018-05-06 21:14:57 If keto kreme isn’t part of your life, it needs to be! From iced coffee to smoothies and everything in between! 4 types of Collagen, 3 types of MCT oil, and DNA repair AC11 sweetened with stevia is a perfect addition to your drinks.
1031 2018-05-06 21:14:46 Sooo mineral oil, petrolatum etc has a small enough particle size it can get into the body, and it JUST STAYS THERE. We can't metabolise it. So gross! It has no nourishing benefits, and the petrol industry is destroying the enviroment. Use plant oils instead obviously! #skincare
1032 2018-05-06 21:14:24 I'm free right now if you want me to come to your house, sweetheart. I'll bring some oil and sheets so we can do this properly.
1033 2018-05-06 21:14:23 thats ok then - I did not want you, load, truck or oil rig dissapare over night!!!!!!!
1034 2018-05-06 21:14:23 Eh...Oil, Gas and electricity are three of the easiest things to buy in the world. The interconnecter with Europe takes care of the electricity and oil and gas are traded freely on the open market. It’s not like our Gas and Oil can’t be got elsewhere
1035 2018-05-06 21:14:15 Improved efficiency means paying less for gas. Paying less for gas cuts into oil company profits. Well, there's your problem.
1036 2018-05-06 21:14:11 I've checked it out. It seems that the down side of cooking with walnut oil on a high heat is that it makes it taste bitter. My "crisps" we're delicious, although not particularly crispy 
1037 2018-05-06 21:13:54 It’s the same concept as a brownie. You just decarb (heat treat) cannabis and mix it with a fat, and coconut oil is one of the best fats for it, to make it edible. I add it to all kinds of foods and drinks. Great for nighttime 
1038 2018-05-06 21:13:47 At the left, wash machine soap, middle oil and at the right a gummy egg 
1039 2018-05-06 21:13:34 Husband - jeez, you’re really red. did you honestly put any sun cream on?
Me - erm....no
Husband - what did you put on then?
Me - coconut oil. The good stuff, from Tahiti
Husband - dick

S&P
Garlic powder
Turmeric
Cardamom
Cinnamon
Sage
Thyme

A bit of olive oil and herbed breadcrumbs, and then maple syrup drizzled on.

This is going to taste like some sort of maple curry, isn't it.
1041 2018-05-06 21:13:17 The flat tax is the reason we have a massive infrastructure deficit, a tiny Hertiage Fund, and over reliance on oil revenues. Straight up the stupidest fiscal policy of any government in Canada. #ableg
1042 2018-05-06 21:13:04 There’s nothing in the desert, and no man needs nothing... until Man found oil.
1043 2018-05-06 21:13:00 Ecclesiasticus 39:26 The principal things for the whole use of man's life are water, fire, iron, and salt, flour of wheat, honey, milk, and the blood of the grape, and oil, and clothing.
1044 2018-05-06 21:12:41 No only against the expansion of the pipeline to the Westridge Marine Terminal for the sole purpose of selling oil to Asia. The best way to avoid a spill altogether and protect our incredibly sensitive ecosystem is to not allow this activity in the first place. #StoppedKM #bcpoli

1051 2018-05-06 21:11:46 For God's sake, when I start to post about what has transpired over this InLaws road trip-PLEASE someone remind me about the "broken olive oil bottle in the driveway of the rental house" situation. K? Thanks.
1052 2018-05-06 21:11:07 @KitchenAidUSA My stand mixer was a shower gift in 1996. The mixer outlasted the marriage! Lately, it's been leaking oil into the bowl. What can I do? Thanks for sticking with me for 22 years, when others didn't. 
1053 2018-05-06 21:10:52 depends which ones you get. the sun flower oil and spud ones work whereas the ones coated in wheat are rank. they just look the same, but they aint.
1054 2018-05-06 21:10:44 Lmao, I have serious oil on my head.
Please take me.
1055 2018-05-06 21:10:36 he's done three videos in total pushing the Snake Oil salesman RDS. The last one was only 5 months, long after the interwebs figured out what a con artist he was and dropped him by the wayside. If Jordan hasn't figured it out, what use could he actually be? thats the way I see it

1084 2018-05-06 21:06:48 Hi Chris. I think these are great - I also get really frustrated when people are referred to as resources - as if they are fungible like iron ore and crude oil.
1085 2018-05-06 21:06:24 Let me see if I have this straight about your position. You want to StopKM and cease use of pipelines & oil tankers? One method of accomplishing that, you think, is to attack small environmental remediation and restoration firms that do things like clean up sewage spills,...
1086 2018-05-06 21:06:16 now we need to fix the situation in Venezuela, a socialist government out of control that used to be an oil rich country, when will Bernie Sanders stop praising this countries form of government, the good news is we're working on denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula
1087 2018-05-06 21:06:06 You cant do that on one hand and support building #pipelines on the other.  That is cutting off your nose to spite your face.  She sold out to Big Oil, just like all the Liberals did. #cdnpoli #onpoli #bcpoli #climatechange #environment #ClimateAction

1089 2018-05-06 21:05:50 True but our exports to the EU fell in real terms over the last 10 years and our main market is the rUK at about 60%. We also export more to the rest of the world than to the EU. We’re also over reliant on oil and drinks for exports. It’s the Dutch disease
1090 2018-05-06 21:05:49 It’s the oligarchs, they fight against anything healthy and things that will ruin oil, gas, coal industries. And the agriculture industries, They are not sustainable.
1091 2018-05-06 21:05:45 Depends what kind of scene you're writing. If it's some form of battle charge or stand-off, I recommend 'Oil of Empire' soundtrack from Battlefield One. Short, but gets a lot of intense emotion across.

1099 2018-05-06 21:04:21 my question.
Why?
1100 2018-05-06 21:04:18 It was because of oil & gas development this past 100 years that has allowed for complex products such as battery systems for EVs, solar panels, computers & components etc.  We will need both regimes well into the future. But we need to all come to terms on reducing waste ASAP!

1118 2018-05-06 21:01:51 Nice day and decided to go to @Pluckers for munchies and oh man. Waited close to 10 minutes while sitting at the bar to get a drink. Ordered the Buffalo Bites...saturated in oil and looked bad. Tots seemed from an old batch. Service was just bad. Never again!
1119 2018-05-06 21:01:48 I hope it’s olive oil.
1120 2018-05-06 21:01:44 IN Mexico or IN the USA? 

Got plenty of oil sources USA. MX they use lard typically.

Commercialized and commodity sodas and invasion of starbucks, etc have added to the plague in MX. 

Also, loads of beer filled with HFCS is the true problem, just like USA. Culture indifferent
1121 2018-05-06 21:01:44 They suck!  Literally;)
I make a oil for my pets and me, and it deters ticks. Mix a few drops of geranium oil with a spoonful of sunflower oil and apply it to your skin in tick loving spots (warm) and they will stay away:)

1131 2018-05-06 21:00:39 マジレスすると青学にも大量の補助金が我々の税金から投入されて間接的に俺損してる。爆弾騒ぎで動く警察も税金で動いてるから爆破予告マンはマジでクソ。おまけにすべての給料が税金から出てる国の代表（）が19連休してるからもう俺もあと10日くらい休みたい。つまり俺が損せずに休みたい。

1133 2018-05-06 21:00:21 haha so much for getting oil and brakes done last night 
1134 2018-05-06 21:00:13 Baked with olive oil, rosemary and garlic. Dipped in mustard. I need some now. Been my sick comfort food.
1135 2018-05-06 21:00:10 but you don’t need your govt. to boycott oil to boycott it on an individual level. same way you don’t need your govt. to boycott Israeli hummus to do so yourself.
1136 2018-05-06 21:00:05 May 06, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1137 2018-05-06 21:00:02 So companies have to pay for the ability to mine and utilise personal data, in the same way oil companies have to pay to drill for and extract oil?
1138 2018-05-06 21:00:00 I would also suggest that those who think oil can be gone tomorrow, next week, next year, or even a decade from now should give their heads a shake. Certainly it is a sunsetting industry and the industry itself recognizes the fact. The transition will be messy.
1139 2018-05-06 20:59:56 It's all in the presentation. Until recently @DWImpalaOwner thought you were a great cook.

The fire and holy oil is the difference between a great mom and BAMF mom. Personally I'd prefer the latter. 
1140 2018-05-06 20:59:51 I liked when Pam went as Charlie Chaplin and Popeye/Olive Oil
1141 2018-05-06 20:59:49 Just a question Mark... is it ok to heat walnut oil #bitworriedthatitisbestnotto
1142 2018-05-06 20:59:42 Fam I just got the best suck of my life . She hit man w that GORHK GORHRK GORHRK balls fondle w oil combo , I am currently drained and feel like a whore
1143 2018-05-06 20:59:24 Did my own oil change today, hot then a bitch
1144 2018-05-06 20:59:15 Allah yay masu rahma, wlh I feel very deep 
1145 2018-05-06 20:58:53 If there is ANYTHING Michael Moore is ashamed of, being fat certainly ain’t it...
1146 2018-05-06 20:58:33 Oil prices are not indicative of just the US economy dude, lol.  They are directly tied to how we strangle out the Saudis and OPEC.  Which are also tied to Russia. Study and see how it moves the price of WTI, then talk!
1147 2018-05-06 20:58:31 That EQ in the Gulf might have opened up that oil problem again
1148 2018-05-06 20:58:31 I have been trying everything over here. If you would have told me even two years ago I would resort to using *pure oil* on my face I would have scoffed.
1149 2018-05-06 20:58:22 Hahahahahaha tanning oil the lot
1150 2018-05-06 20:57:55 OMG, So true!!  I wouldn't make it to the 4th one. I havent smoked in years and can barely hang with my CBD Oil.  LOL #CBDOol #CBDOilGoodForInsomniaAndPain
1151 2018-05-06 20:57:47 Yes I have been using CBD oil for a few Months now
1152 2018-05-06 20:57:46 I put some oil thing I got from @SajeWellness on Sam to remedy his migraine and now he’s so stuck/impressed by the hot and cold sensation that I worry he might make it worse
1153 2018-05-06 20:57:44 Ohh oil mcburnie
1154 2018-05-06 20:57:38 The blade it's self was poured into a mold instead of forged properly. Katanas are forged strait and curves dipped in oil to cool. This cause distress on the blade to follow the curve. It why it had a fake hamon similar to a supermarket kitchen knife. 3...
1155 2018-05-06 20:57:34 You confirm what I state in my tweet as true. As for UK production of oil, don’t even go there. It’s no yard stick at all for the sector. The UK is not even remotely a major supplier. Factor in that oil reached $120 a barrel during the period above - why did Venezuela stagnate?!
1156 2018-05-06 20:57:31 We are on the verge to Fixit, like Brexit.
We are not. Nothing positive have come trough E.U.
Only negative, to our nation. What is the saying? When Bullshit walks, only money talks, or vice versa!. Or Oil, or Electric...Rape the mother Earth, for finance...This is the politics.
1157 2018-05-06 20:57:25 Yeah so much for all the lives lost and damaged by the promise of Iraqi oil fields. Condemned to everlasting war by a GOP con job!
1158 2018-05-06 20:57:15 Peppermint oil is not working today.
1159 2018-05-06 20:57:13 It was Saudi embargo on oil
1160 2018-05-06 20:57:09 Bruins are petrified.
Someone get oil cans for these tin men.
1161 2018-05-06 20:56:58 I asked for a massage then she like "let me set the mood for this".. she burns incense, lights up candles ,and  got coconut oil...
1162 2018-05-06 20:56:56 I be washin it every day cream and oil I just haven’t kept up with the trimming
1163 2018-05-06 20:56:51 Yesterday i made sure to put sunscreen on so i didn’t look like an idiot in my dress for graduation. Turns out it was tanning oil so needless to say I’m fackin fried
1164 2018-05-06 20:56:30 Broadway rosehip oil lipgloss is love.
1165 2018-05-06 20:56:26 Oil sheen spray. But spray it on to a comb or brush and comb it in. Don’t spray it directly onto ya face lol. Your face will end up shiny 
1166 2018-05-06 20:56:16 So sami zayn wasn't in the oil rumble because he's of Syrian descent, but he did wrestle there in 2014 when presumably he had the same ancestry as he does now ... this is all very weird. 
1167 2018-05-06 20:56:07 2. Trillions of dollars a year in welfare to corporate welfare queens - Nestle, Pepsi, Coca Cola, banks, oil, Comcast, Facebook, Google, Apple, coal, prescription drugs, etc
1168 2018-05-06 20:55:51 Cleaning the bottom of the saucepan cupboard, found some old coins and a brass oil lamp/dispenser thingy.
1169 2018-05-06 20:55:48 Sería mejor que nadie se quede con Oil?? O se la regalan??
1170 2018-05-06 20:55:39 @theherbalmom0 I'd love info on how to make my own oils. Been growing and cooking with herbs for years. But live, love, love lavender oil. It's just so soothing.
1171 2018-05-06 20:55:18 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
1172 2018-05-06 20:55:10 keep forgetting my coconut oil has melted and keep dunking my fucking hand in there when i just wanna scrape a little off the top
1173 2018-05-06 20:55:09 My FIL who is/was Italian, Lanfranca, used to say "Basta" and my MIL made the best sauce, omg it was the bomb. The the sliced tomatoes with mozzerella cheese slices and mint lightly sprinkled with olive oil, yumm...
1174 2018-05-06 20:55:07 Let's face it, the less we need oil, the fewer Wars we have. And the fewer Wars we have, l the smaller the defense budget can be. Then, we can properly educate our kids and we can all have health care and even reduce the federal deficit.
1175 2018-05-06 20:54:58 Body Rubbed up n down with coconut oil nigga I'm ready for the sun to fry my ass
1176 2018-05-06 20:54:52 Can you use avocado oil too?
1177 2018-05-06 20:54:38 Soak nails in olive oil for five minutes for deep moisturizing.
1178 2018-05-06 20:54:37 whos ready for the heatwave?!? im ready with my sunshades and baby oil sat in the shimmering sun
1179 2018-05-06 20:54:36 Oh thanks for this!
I honestly thought we had some oil in our pond 
Phew this is good to know!
1180 2018-05-06 20:54:29 I love Truth and Honesty

tbh, above all fucking else
1181 2018-05-06 20:54:22 OMG! I laughed my ass off when I saw this. Then I read some of the tweets that said oil was bad for the squirrel. 
1182 2018-05-06 20:54:08 Actually, everywhere I put coconut oil is shiny and smooth 
1183 2018-05-06 20:53:58 We ordered more heating oil & the next day found a tick on @WithnailTheDood tail the next day 
1184 2018-05-06 20:53:45 @iujibril salam Sir. What measures is your ministry taking regarding used oil indiscriminate disposals by transportation mechanics and heavy machinery users, that is hampering both internal and external environment in its degradation potentials?  Thankyou.
1185 2018-05-06 20:53:37 The fact of the matter is our oil costs more to produce and sells for less. A 21% rate of return is better than a 6% rate of return, but doesn’t really compete with the 64% rate an oil and gas company would get in Texas or the 86% rate they would get in Saudi Arabia, does it? 1/2
1186 2018-05-06 20:53:23 Mike looks like Tim-Nice-But-Dim from Harry Enfield and Chums if he'd shaved his head and then been assaulted by a gang of youths with Cheesestrings and vegetable oil

Plus taxes and fees.
1188 2018-05-06 20:53:04 Oh how I’ve missed the smell of sun tan oil  #hellosummer
1189 2018-05-06 20:52:56 I was going to guess around $650. I asked for an oil change but didn't specify a basic one. Not that it matters. Still lots of $$$ out of pocket. Manual labor is what drives up the price.
1190 2018-05-06 20:52:48 I love multiple dialects
1191 2018-05-06 20:52:42 In order to boycott oil, you would (presumably) change government policy and that would initiate the boycott; BDS is based on individuals/organisations no longer purchasing goods linked to the occupation
1192 2018-05-06 20:52:41 Why would this Country sacrifice the lifes of many and put out the Fires of Oil Wells in Iraq and walk away only to return again to fight another day. ONE MAN we know has made his family wealthy on our Blood.

1194 2018-05-06 20:52:32 @Scully64 lol hilarious.  And all you animal rights champions chill the heck out about the oil.
1195 2018-05-06 20:52:24 may I ask how and for what you would use this oil? some of my hair and products and lotions contain coconut oil [no cannabis] lol. And if you would use it for cooking-would that not be a waste of cannabis ? Just curious-I am a brownie consumer with permission of pain mmgmt doctor

1198 2018-05-06 20:52:05 It seems like ED has been planning to be President and setting up for a long time or at least some time. Since when does Zimbabwe start having links with Oil\gas rich gulf region? The deals will probably be linked to gas exploration? ehh.

1200 2018-05-06 20:51:49 Are u suggesting that Kamisa is a snake oil salesman given his lofty promises
1201 2018-05-06 20:51:46 yes, thanks to the moisturizing properties of coconut oil after each shower.
1202 2018-05-06 20:51:43 You have accurately assessed the competency of Oz . 
a TV doctor , snake oil pusher
1203 2018-05-06 20:51:39 Turns out Lorenzo took all the damn oil
1204 2018-05-06 20:51:38 I can't keep track on who to boycott. I quit the boycott when the don't buy grapes grown in Chile, 1988. Exxon gas boycott because of the Exxon Valdez oil supertanker oil spill in Alaska. Boycotts are nothing new that's why I don't shop Macy's anymore

1209 2018-05-06 20:50:32 CA$1.529 per litre in Victoria, BC, Canada. That would be US$4.76 per U.S. gallon. It pisses most of us off because we are your biggest source of imported oil.
1210 2018-05-06 20:50:25 1) Costs of installed, distributed solar and wind are rapidly declining (ok, until Trump put high tariffs on imported solar)
2) costs of electricity from coal, oil, gas and hydro don't include externalized costs of the destruction and damages to human and enviromental health
1211 2018-05-06 20:50:17 With summer nearly here and temperatures to match right now, it's a good time to check your oil, a/c, battery and tires. I know I'll need 2 new tires eventually.
1212 2018-05-06 20:50:12 US Presidents have no effect on oil or gas prices. But you can kiss your tax cut goodbye.
1213 2018-05-06 20:50:09 Russia. Oil prices will jump as Iranian oil comes off the market.
1214 2018-05-06 20:50:09 I'm browning stewing steak and I just got poked in the eye with a splat of airborne oil. I think the folks on the other side of the A1 heard me call my frying pan a dirty spitting camel of a cunt.
1215 2018-05-06 20:50:05 I wish coconut oil could remove my problems as well as it removes my makeup everyday
1216 2018-05-06 20:49:42 Your oil executive puppet masters are gouging Canadians to fund your party of bigotry and you blame the PM. Canadians are much smarter than the Rebel crowd you have around.
1217 2018-05-06 20:49:35 I'm high fat, moderate protein and low carb.  I am still feeling my way around it but don't underestimate coconut oil.   Make sure you're eating your greens.
1218 2018-05-06 20:49:33 Oh, the farmers will just love that! Wait! Don’t harvest those crops or maybe put them in the root cellar until Rump opens up the country. Wait! Labor, we won’t be exporting those Ford trucks, oil products and colleges, no foreign students, Profs a Va Ca 4 you. Can’t think beyond
1219 2018-05-06 20:49:29 @NESREANigeria hello, please what is nesrea doing regarding waste oil or used oil indiscriminate disposals in mechanic workshops that usually eventually endup contaminating larger environment and the ecosystem?

My mother suggests I drink it again before bed. I did. Still nothing all day. And now!!! Yhu shame. Respect. & apologies for my lack of faith

1230 2018-05-06 20:48:32 I got my oil changed for $20... wow 
1231 2018-05-06 20:48:30 Lavender oil on your window ledges and around your window really do repel certain insects 
1232 2018-05-06 20:48:21 Both products are -$20 and last a good bit. So, section off hair starting from one side, spray, section next, spray etc and then comb through with wide tooth comb or multi bristle (soft) brush. Style as normal. It will pull up the surface oils for you but not halt oil prod.
1233 2018-05-06 20:48:08 I disagree because a country like KSA is propped up completely by oil. they can (and do) buy weapons elsewhere, whereas boycotting their oil could compel real change. boycotting Iranian oil led to nuclear program negotiations.
1234 2018-05-06 20:47:58 Its funny when I have to make calls for work and it’s a message for the mans oil change and his jealous girl answer then gives attitude thinking Im a mistress when it just a message for their appointment

1269 2018-05-06 20:43:26 Hater"s"? I'm one guy. And fries are supposed to be double fried without asking. But if In N Out only drops them once in the oil then that explains why they always seem under done. That be like @SnoopDogg droppin' it like it's slightly to room temperature.
1270 2018-05-06 20:43:12 And the fact that some Russian oil businessman wants to inject £500m into Rangers.
1271 2018-05-06 20:43:11 Just realizing I have started 6 cooking  projects for today, (7 if you count the cannabis coconut oil I want to make) So I better hurry up and take Banksy to the park so I can get back and get started cooking and baking

1278 2018-05-06 20:42:45 アルガンオイルってヒートテックにも入ってるやつだよね？発売当初、へーっと思ったけど使ったことないや。保湿目的だよね？私はビタミンEオイルにtea tree oil混ぜて使ってる^_^ tea tree oilは本当は肌に直接は良くないらしいけど、薄めてるからいっか、って。
1279 2018-05-06 20:42:39 Senator:  If you Socialists would get out of the way,  we don’t need to import any oil from OPEC. Energy independence important to jobs, economy, National Security and ending trade deficits.   Stop the BS.  JM
1280 2018-05-06 20:42:34 I agree, for me personally it was never about numbers or oil etc. I identify as Scottish & British as enthusiastically as you identify as Scottish & independent from U.K.

In reality the heart is where we all settled the matter for ourselves - despite the debates on economics etc
1281 2018-05-06 20:42:33 Wooow uou beautiful though mel ... like water and oil we boil beef for the whole family a crazy combination innit

1283 2018-05-06 20:42:22 In a world where corporations, including Big Oil, control governments
There would be hundreds of marshals guarding oil pipes from people
And zero marshals arresting politicians and executives in #flint #michigan
....or guarding the pipes from lead
1284 2018-05-06 20:42:06 just spent $100 on an oil change 
1285 2018-05-06 20:42:06 Wow @HomeGoods in Merrick has horrible customer service and policy... open coconut oil capsules no refund and back on the shelf #homegoods #tix #horrible #dontshop @tjmaxx @marshalls @sshoredoc
1286 2018-05-06 20:41:50 @oil_markets Thanks for the RT!
1287 2018-05-06 20:41:40 They should be following up in these death threats @RachelNotley and @JustinTrudeau have been getting to see how this goes back to a lot of the same trolls pushing the pro oil agenda!
1288 2018-05-06 20:41:28 A draw feels right. I think they should bring in some kiddie pools of oil and let them wrassle it out.
1289 2018-05-06 20:41:14 Pls remind me who owns bambeauty oil
Pls remind me who owns alpha apparel
In other words they built they brand differently!!!!

1301 2018-05-06 20:39:17 Try coconut oil, lucy bee is good and salcura dermaspray (you can get it on amazon) is also really good. Xx
1302 2018-05-06 20:38:51 If This Were the zombie apocalypse, and you needed to get 50 miles away from a horde, yes.  Then you could drain the hot oil and cook your Roadkill to perfection.
1303 2018-05-06 20:38:32 Whatever happened to my career more like it. She has weird skin doesn't she? I think she's been overdoing the Oil of Ulay, or is it getting oiled on Islay, hah!
1304 2018-05-06 20:38:31 When our ancestors lived in small villages, we were pre-scietific in our healing knowledge. Everyone is far better off today. 

Dr. Oz is an asshole. He's just another flim-flam snake oil salesman joining his people in the Trump Administration.

1312 2018-05-06 20:37:47 I straightened it this summer and it became very bad, now it's recovering, leave it natural! Do not touch it with the iron or the dryer. use aloe vera oil and all the oils you can!

1315 2018-05-06 20:37:24 Did you know, Black HP printer ink costs roughly 1,400 times as much as crude oil, gallon for gallon.#Checkpoint #MerciArsene
1316 2018-05-06 20:37:06 I ... I don’t know where to start. Maybe you’re an overeager college kid I dunno. Bad faith? Bank my “claim”? 
Just use common sense, wee birds don’t need oil on their feathers. And just don’t use the oil anyway, it’s bad for everything that will come into contact with it.
1317 2018-05-06 20:36:56 out from under sanctions for one thing but the obvious conspiracy with the russians has kept trump from fulfilling his promise.
1318 2018-05-06 20:36:52 A #CPC MP tweeted that high gas prices in Vancouver are due in part to TransMountain delay. This is a lie. TransMountain's original application posited oil could flow by December 2019. That's more than 1.5 years from now. Stop lying @jamesbezan @CPC_HQ #cdnpoli #abpoli
1319 2018-05-06 20:36:34 Question is,  are they leaving too much of the stuff in the ground and before they have monetised it all the world enters a steep decline in oil usage?
1320 2018-05-06 20:36:28 the only thing bad about coconut oil is that the hotter it gets the more of a liquid it becomes.
1321 2018-05-06 20:36:18 Does anyone know where we can dispose of used oil?
1322 2018-05-06 20:36:16 Been sitting here waiting to get my oil changed since 2.........

1327 2018-05-06 20:35:09 C'mon, what's a bot gotta do to get an oil fix around here?
1328 2018-05-06 20:34:51 Olive oil, bit of salt, load of black pepper. Sorted.
1329 2018-05-06 20:34:50 Oil slick would look AMAZING!
1330 2018-05-06 20:34:37 I unfollowed this jackazz last year.
1331 2018-05-06 20:34:12 Interesting. I wonder if this will bring new discoverable oil to the Gulf?
1332 2018-05-06 20:34:05 try treating it with calamine lotion, let it dry on your skin (preferably overnight) and when you wash it off, put on some aloe vera gel. tea tree oil also helps for acne, remember to dilute it before use! 
1333 2018-05-06 20:33:49 ALKSDJFLKDFJ VIOLATED! jimin hairline is fine, just needed a lil castor oil on de temples... lotsa mens is like that
1334 2018-05-06 20:33:48 We have had the Dollar at N365 since oil sold at $45/bar, today oil sells at $75/bar, why no change in the exchange rate?

Buhari why?
1335 2018-05-06 20:33:30 Lo que más me gustaría en este momento es que me caigan mil litros de gas oil del cielo
1336 2018-05-06 20:33:23 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
1337 2018-05-06 20:33:17 When you increase oil tanker traffic from 5 oil tankers / month to 37 for starters, you’ve already planned on sending oil tankers each and every day. Ferry crossings get cancelled regularly in bad weather and they don’t sail out of Burrard InletTankers driven by $ and greed will!
1338 2018-05-06 20:33:08 Yes! Sweet potatoes with onion and garlic drizzled with salt, olive oil, rosemary and thyme.

1340 2018-05-06 20:32:22 Holy crap. That's serious stuff. I don't own truffle oil or parmesan (I don't like it) But I do cook them 10 minutes longer. They are still shit.

1352 2018-05-06 20:30:03 To select a healthy cooking oil, look for expeller- pressed or cold-pressed oils to ensure you are buying high-quality, undamaged oil. Oi...
1353 2018-05-06 20:30:03 Ah! So a new National Energy Programme to keep oil and gas prices low would be a great idea.

Is that what you are saying Andrew?
#cdnpoli #canpoli
1354 2018-05-06 20:29:45 Ok but there's no oil or concentrates soooo..its a fail for me
1355 2018-05-06 20:29:37 Yeah that’s the last thing you want to be doing is going under a car in this heat trying to drain the oil
1356 2018-05-06 20:29:36 Do not drink that Ｏｉl girl !
1357 2018-05-06 20:29:25 Can’t find my coconut oil
1358 2018-05-06 20:29:16 Cbd oil is amazing man. I suffer from depression, anxiety, and psoriatic arthritis and it all goes away in 2 drops of that shit. Amazing.
1359 2018-05-06 20:29:14 Which americunts did while buying oil and licking saudi ass 
1360 2018-05-06 20:29:13 I get to oil up models today  life sweet
1361 2018-05-06 20:29:11 Regime change is what hit us into this mess in 1953. A democratically elected leader was overthrown because he wouldn’t let the UK & US exploit their oil. Mossadegh was a moderate and we couldn’t have that
1362 2018-05-06 20:28:58 Hey @jeff_gluck why did you delete the tweet talking about @NASCAR laying down speedy dry all the way around the track because KyBu was spitting parts and oil the whole way?
1363 2018-05-06 20:28:56 Yeah you use it to get the oil filter off. I played pirates with it while my dad sighed in disappointment.
1364 2018-05-06 20:28:53 How many times can you reuse deep fry oil?
1365 2018-05-06 20:28:51 If eating lamb (delicious mystery meat in oil) over (a pound of) rice with extra white (mayonnaise) sauce at 3am every other night were healthy I’d be in great shape
1366 2018-05-06 20:28:49 We have plenty of oil reserves in our own country. Just need to crank up West Texas. Keep pushing towards energy independence.
1367 2018-05-06 20:28:42 Extended caution for cleanup here as they put oil dry from Turn 4 to Turn 3. Kyle Busch went almost all the way around the track spewing oil and driveshaft pieces, but for some reason there was no caution for quite a long time.
1368 2018-05-06 20:28:29 Hope you change the oil already.
1369 2018-05-06 20:28:12 Any oil painters out there who can advise - if you paint a colour that you don’t like - (too dark/muddy) what’s best way to cover it with lighter? I assume oil takes a long time to dry, wipe off with a rag? Or scrape off canvas? Or do I need to wait for it to dry?
1370 2018-05-06 20:28:12 actual get me on holiday right nowwwwww bikini on, lathered in tanning oil, freckles oot pls pls 
1371 2018-05-06 20:28:09 Bezos pays very little in taxes - he gets lots of tax breaks which are subsidized by our taxes (like the oil industry subsidies to drill and kill).  He's backing out of a deal in Seattle because he doesn't want the tax that would help homeless there.
1372 2018-05-06 20:28:05 It still says nothing more than what little you’ve provided already and repeated several times over. You’ve provided nothing new to support oil spills and 7 times nes the extra oil tanker traffic to sell oil around the planet to Asia.
1373 2018-05-06 20:28:02 @DaleJr this reminds me of Homestead in 2015? Oil everywhere and you guys were sliding and hitting the wall, and Bodine was saying it was clear, and I think you had a quote that went along the lines of "Is he out here in the fucking cars!?"

1376 2018-05-06 20:27:22 Wasn't the plot of The Defenders essentially the search for the bones of an oil dragon?
1377 2018-05-06 20:27:17 I preferred you when you attacked other nations only for oil, now if we aren’t a follower of this President, our democracy is in a serious danger. Hope common sense will prevail in the next elections. Goodbye and Good Luck.
1378 2018-05-06 20:26:51 Nothing would surprise me when it comes to a snake oil salesman.

1380 2018-05-06 20:26:30 Maybe it’s just olive oil or sunflower oil and it wears off?
1381 2018-05-06 20:26:23 If olive oil comes from olives, where does baby oil come from
1382 2018-05-06 20:26:04 Gimme some gauze pads, 3-in-1 oil and about 10 gallons of antifreeze, preferably  Prestone. Make that Quaker State.
1383 2018-05-06 20:25:52 Higher oil prices helping Kremlin.
1384 2018-05-06 20:25:33 I want to live inside an oil painting, I need that level of warmth and drama
1385 2018-05-06 20:25:24 It ticks me of that people like the Podesta brothers are walking around scott free. I like see what the Podesta’s were doing in Russia. I believe they had an oil company during Hillary’s time at State Department

1388 2018-05-06 20:25:10 at least it won't be a publicity stunt like when left right in the Middle of a Colts Game at Lucas Oil Stadium costed the City of Indianapolis tons of money trust me it is better that they don't come to South Bend like they have here
1389 2018-05-06 20:25:06 Kyle Busch crew chief Adam Stevens tells team they need to see if they can get the piece of driveshaft back. Guess it was somewhere out on the track, along with all that oil.
1390 2018-05-06 20:24:51 Hurrah! New contracts for US and European oil companies! I mean - what a disturbing news. Another Putin's evil plan, for sure. 
Seriously, though, this "warning" will not prevent France from participating in campaign. Probably a signal that France wants to discuss it's share.

1393 2018-05-06 20:24:36 You’re going to love vape oil cartridges.
1394 2018-05-06 20:24:29 Raw sunflower seeds are so rich. I’m chewing a mouthful and it’s coating my teeth with all these natural oils; it’s like oil pulling without the wrinse. And then sometimes the kernels just taste like Lays chips but chewy. Sunflower oil, sunflower seeds.
1395 2018-05-06 20:24:23 Eu arranjei a solução para todas as pessoas que têm estrias metam Bio oil juro que resulta
1396 2018-05-06 20:24:10 need to buy one of those essential oil diffuser cus a bitch is stressed out
1397 2018-05-06 20:24:08 What were they waiting for?  I know the racing is terrible.  Maybe oil on track make it better.
1398 2018-05-06 20:23:48 @NASCAR great job on throwing out the yellow after the 18 put oil everywhere 
1399 2018-05-06 20:23:22 Wandering the hills around my parent's home and finding lost/abandoned things like an olive oil press, rusted out cars, matresses, alligator lizards, etc. Walking across town and railroad tracks to the library to check out new books.
1400 2018-05-06 20:23:17 ???? What are you saying you olive oil cracker
1401 2018-05-06 20:23:13 How about "will any of man city's academy players ever get a chance under lord pep?" Always negative stories about everyone except oil city!
1402 2018-05-06 20:23:11 Our prediction for May crude oil prices will hit a year low under $43per Barrel on May 25th 2018@crude oil lowest prices of 2018 summer of 2018
1403 2018-05-06 20:23:04 Right,  because we had no oil issues before Obama... You people are exhausting.
1404 2018-05-06 20:23:02 The track is covered in oil.  #nascar
1405 2018-05-06 20:22:59 You need couple of 8 balls some Russian hookers, some warm baby oil, then rip off the shower curtains.
1406 2018-05-06 20:22:57 “I don’t know why NASCAR is so late throwing these cautions anymore. I mean, there’s oil flying everywhere and a driveshaft laying on the front stretch.” - Johnson.
1407 2018-05-06 20:22:51 And a shower filter so you arent washing your hair with water that has metals in it. 
I would wash my hair with a sulfatw free Moroccan oil shampoo and then rub sweet almond oil in it while it was still damp.
Thats it. And then a weekly hair mask of avocado and placenta
1408 2018-05-06 20:22:50 haha;  reminds me of baby oil and iodine days...
1409 2018-05-06 20:22:42 Gonna try this castor oil shit & it better work
1410 2018-05-06 20:22:27 PSA!! Stop changing shampoo/soap/food formulas to put coconut oil/extract in them!! Coconut oil is so often hidden in ingredients lists in products and it is something that so many people are allergic to THANKS
1411 2018-05-06 20:22:19 Merely a more complicated puzzle to solve. Plus, some oil to clean up.
1412 2018-05-06 20:22:16 Getting oil (petroleum engineering, highly male, highly variable, highly paid) is important.

But so is taking care of people with special needs. (highly female, low variability, low pay)

Utilitarian arguments fail hard when someone didn’t ask to be born with special needs!
1413 2018-05-06 20:22:14 Oil tanks
1414 2018-05-06 20:22:05 December 2013 KM makes application. Aims to have  oil flow by December 2019.

TransMountain delay is not the reason for high prices. You are dishonest.

1415 2018-05-06 20:21:51 one time i was going to hook up with guy and my legs were ashy and i didn’t have time and used olive oil & when we got to the deed he was like “mmm smells like olive garden” i haddda go and take the L
1416 2018-05-06 20:21:50 he was referring to nascar - oil everywhere and no caution (until they called one)
1417 2018-05-06 20:21:47 oil filter pliers, I think!
1418 2018-05-06 20:21:41 Mxm just spilt my diffuser oil
1419 2018-05-06 20:21:20 .@KyleBusch had something let go in his car... @KevinHarvick did a nice job of keeping his @jimmyjohns Ford straight through all that oil.
1420 2018-05-06 20:21:18 It seems like P.T. was off a little.. a sucker born every minute? In this USA He makes it seem  like there was one born every millisecond!!! How can there BE so MAny suckers thar buy his snake oil in "SUPPOSEDLY" the most educated country in the world?
1421 2018-05-06 20:21:14 I don’t think I can Jane but I try to ensure I don’t buy products with palm oil in & ask my colleagues not to as well
1422 2018-05-06 20:21:09 That included my oil change and freon in addition to a new compressor and manual labor.
1423 2018-05-06 20:21:01 Not proven, just rants.  When they said £8bn pa oil revenue it was bollocks and you knew it.  What exactly in the history of the North Sea made them think that would happen?  I tried so hard to find a sucker to bet on it, and no one would #Simon/Erlich
1424 2018-05-06 20:20:57 I said no comments!!!! No not on this occasion put oil in my car Friday n let’s just say car was smoking earlier put a bit too much so been trying to drain last few hours!!! That’s something you want to be doing on a bank holiday Sunday especially when it’s nice like this
1425 2018-05-06 20:20:44 @NASCAR you guys are a bunch of dumb shits. Drivers are yelling oil is on the track and you dumb asses sit there with your thumbs up your ass
1426 2018-05-06 20:20:35 Okay so almond oil. Copy. What else
1427 2018-05-06 20:20:32 AH: watch the 95 here, clear clear, got one in the wall here, 18 in the wall, no caution, I don't know why, no caution... and now they put the caution out
AD: oil all over the track,
AH: yeah I don't know. broke the driveshaft in it, they said.
#AD3 #NASCAR
1428 2018-05-06 20:20:14 Caution - 18, @mattdracing says there is oil EVERYWHERE on the racetrack. Might be a lengthy cleanup.
1429 2018-05-06 20:20:10 WHY THE FUCK DO YOU LEAVE THE RACE GREEN WHEN THERE IS OIL EVERYWHERE
1430 2018-05-06 20:20:09 Dude, the US became more energy independent under Obama than at any other time in recent history. It might not have been Obama’s policies that did it - the ND oil shale boom is the reason - but we are much less dependent on foreign oil than in the past.
1431 2018-05-06 20:20:09 "#18 off the pace. Still green." - @doug_campbell95 "Oil all over the damn track." - @kaseykahne pissed they didn't call caution sooner. He got in it and dropped way back. "NASCAR pay attention!" - KK
1432 2018-05-06 20:20:07 Engine oil and brake fluid. The battery will doubtless be flat so that'll need charging. Then mot, tax and insurance. 
1433 2018-05-06 20:20:02 "Caution is out, caution is out"

@DavidRagan "yeah, there's oil all over the track"
1434 2018-05-06 20:19:54 Johnson is screaming “OIL OIL OIL everywhere!” Then “Come on NASCAR this is F——- stupid!” KyBusch off pace with apparent engine problem.
1435 2018-05-06 20:19:53 Caution on track for the 18 car 
@tydillon says that there is oil around the entire track.
1436 2018-05-06 20:19:50 @Blaney says their is oil everywhere on the track. 

@KyleBusch says the driveshaft is gone. 

#NASCAR
1437 2018-05-06 20:19:46 Kyle Busch smoking looks like oil #NASCAR Caution out
1438 2018-05-06 20:19:43 Accidentally put on too much exotic basil oil on to clear mind, body, spirit. Smelling like a Thai take out
1439 2018-05-06 20:19:41 Uhh... @NASCAR there’s oil EVERYWHERE
1440 2018-05-06 20:19:31 Swear I’m just destined to have shit skin, I don’t even remember the last time it was scar, spot or oil free
1441 2018-05-06 20:19:24 Why not? We as a society have been burning oil and gas for the last 100 years plus. Things become obsolete and things become singularly popular.
1442 2018-05-06 20:19:17 Dokita eku irole sir.. Shey alafia lewa? Awon omo ati auntie mi nko? Ebami kiwon ooo.. Ejo kin ni "drop of oil sir" ?
1443 2018-05-06 20:19:15 Oil everywhere according to radio ... drivers want caution.
1444 2018-05-06 20:19:14 Might as well take Mexicos too. Proves morons can’t run oil companies.
1445 2018-05-06 20:19:03 That oil painting of Veronica is still creepy/ hilarious.
1446 2018-05-06 20:19:02 So @duclet_oil blocked me.

But no reason given 

OH BOY.
1447 2018-05-06 20:18:59 君を揚げたいな…君を炒めたいな…君に僕を絡めたいな…僕は君のそんな存在になりたい。いや、既になってるだろう?
1448 2018-05-06 20:18:36 احساسي يقول انك اكثر شخص فاهم
1449 2018-05-06 20:18:03 Sorry. This is nothing compared to last year Anaheim / Oilers. Just glad others get a small taste of what we went through last year. And you have Marchand in your team so....
1450 2018-05-06 20:17:57 Love them all.  It’s all in how you prepare them.  Sauté kale in coconut milk and add some pine nuts and red onion.  Delicious.  Sweet potatoes with a little coconut oil and cinnamon are yummy.  quinoa has so many possibilities to accentuate its nutty flavor.
1451 2018-05-06 20:17:52 You should have listened to the people who had lost their jobs because of Obama policies and were thanking @POTUS for helping them with the tax cuts and opening the coal/oil/steel industries.
1452 2018-05-06 20:17:45 The secret with these is you need to cook them at least 10 minutes longer than it says on the packet. A drizzle of truffle oil and a few shavings of Parmesan = Champions League chips If not try M&S triple cooked chips . Up your chip game Hells Bells 
1453 2018-05-06 20:17:44 I put coconut oil in my hair yesterday and left it and I’m pretty sure it’s solved more of my life problems than just split ends

1456 2018-05-06 20:17:19 That’s true. It Rape oil tastes just fine.
However, I can do without the sinus headache the pollen gives me.
1457 2018-05-06 20:17:15 The older you get, the more you should listen to your body. When it says “slow down”, slow down. When it says “Stop!”, stop! The things you think are of vital importance actually will not matter to you when you are dead. Occasionally put a drop of oil into your life’s machine.
1458 2018-05-06 20:17:12 I went natural for 6 months after doing serious damage. But i didn't start seeing poppin curls until i added almond oil to my daily hair care
1459 2018-05-06 20:17:07 Tax payers money for corporate tax breaks, oil subsidies, banks bail outs, to bomb sovereign countries, aid to Israel, now tax payers money for churches (tax exempt)...No problem 
Tax payers money for healthcare for the elderly and kids, school lunches for poor kids...socialism!!
1460 2018-05-06 20:16:57 It's going to be hard trying to oil the bark of the tree in our garden but a great idea!

1462 2018-05-06 20:16:46 Currently laying in my bed, Rascal Flatts throwback songs playing, peppermint in my oil diffuser, sipping tea, and working on a 12 page study guide for my psych final Tuesday. I’ve hit my prime
1463 2018-05-06 20:16:43 Making edibles for this flight wednesday. Got 2.5 g of oil to use.
1464 2018-05-06 20:16:42 Not charging. Also not a good idea to see a player coming in on you and turn your back so you get nailed. Square up and absorb hit or hit back. But so not charging...
1465 2018-05-06 20:16:29 Project garage open 7-9pm . It has been nice to chat to visitors and find some new art collectors. Oil paintings have gone well as have Simon's pop art paintings.

1470 2018-05-06 20:15:46 Good day for some oil
1471 2018-05-06 20:15:35 Which port was ship anchored in and where or what terminal did they unload? Where and how was the oil transported after?
1472 2018-05-06 20:15:23 And our so called allies in Germany & EU & Russia as with the Oil for Food Program, were well paid by them in helping them get it...using slippery diplomatic cover of UN to evade sanctions via UNCTAD & Trade Point Program, imho
1473 2018-05-06 20:15:17 Saya dah guna. Charcoal dgn argan oil. Mmng sgt best serious. Muka rasa fresh and clean gilaa. Pastu senang nk carry gi memana. Mascara tetebal pun hilang
1474 2018-05-06 20:15:14 Imp: well I figure I can change the oil and change a tire and jump start a car, I'm ahead of most people
Me: Yeah but we're trying to find the wiring diagram for a (RL's car). I know when I had a similar problem w/ (my car) it was the relay.
Imp: I don't know anything about cars
1475 2018-05-06 20:15:13 I got some tea tree oil to rub on my lil sensitive bald head
1476 2018-05-06 20:15:05 Feeling pretty accomplished. Woke up early, put a new thermostat in my car and changed the oil on it.

1479 2018-05-06 20:14:17 We have a couple suggestions for removing pesky labels. Turn your hair dryer on high and blast it for at least 30 seconds - should peel right off. Mix equal parts baking soda and oil, rub gently with a paper towel, let sit for a few seconds, and then wipe clean. Good luck!
1480 2018-05-06 20:14:15 One day soon our gas saving oil burners will be irrelevant. Times change and with that there needs to be safety and reliability for the consumer.
1481 2018-05-06 20:14:12 I’m hoping a couple of oil rich Arabs 
1482 2018-05-06 20:14:09 It was my brother in law’s fault. He farted out on his oil rig.
1483 2018-05-06 20:13:56 @Shell_India in whitefield petrol pump I opted for oil and coolant change the operators charged me 200 rupees extra although I thought the oil change is free of cost can you please help ?
1484 2018-05-06 20:13:32 Obama and those before him made America dependent on foreign oil, now the politicians living high on the hog off those deals are scrambling because Trump is shredding special interest ties & making America self sufficient THATS WHY THEY HATE HIM AND WHY WE LOVE HIM
1485 2018-05-06 20:13:22 I’ve been so stressed about money and getting the oil changed in my car & I forgot that I have a credit card that only has like another payment before it’s back at zero so SHIT I’m putting the oil change on my card lmfao

Important questions to ask yourself before skinning this rodent
1489 2018-05-06 20:12:51 Hi everyone. Lots of walking - positive for health, sat in the sun - pleasurable for a short time ( but many things I do for me are positive & should be positive but r like oil on water) #BPDChat

1492 2018-05-06 20:11:54 Yooo i just struck creative oil

The drought is ovaaa
1493 2018-05-06 20:11:49 Nations that stray from imperialism, possess oil and rare minerals, or try to reject the dollar for another currency are ripe for invasion. First and foremost, leftists must be antiwar and reject the Pentagon and the “Masters of War” Dylan sang about in 1963.
1494 2018-05-06 20:11:46 And everybody would pay that healer a lot of money to sell them snake oil on national television.
1495 2018-05-06 20:11:46 Oil Silk
1496 2018-05-06 20:11:45 That’s a good size for frying. But all the equipment and oil is pricey. Best bet is roasting it 425 degrees. 13ish min a pound
1497 2018-05-06 20:11:36 That’s awesome

1501 2018-05-06 20:10:55 Will they finish my car before my phone dies? They got 6% left to change this oil or I'm going to freak out.

1503 2018-05-06 20:10:21 So, are you telling me that science has produced an explanation for what's occurring, but you have a better explanation?

I suggest you immediately contact the oil companies, because they will make you filthy rich.
1504 2018-05-06 20:10:07 全ての油という油に感謝しているよ。
1505 2018-05-06 20:09:57 @Dischem do you sell black seed oil?
1506 2018-05-06 20:09:46 You've served Nigeria beyond the retirement age. It's high time you should call it a quit and give the lazy youths some opportunity to work and be useful to themselves. You've really enjoyed more oil money than the lazy youths. If you continue, they may think you're lazy also.
1507 2018-05-06 20:09:27 hmmm could be that your scalp is so dry that its overcompensating with oil production to try and recover moisture.  Might be that your needing to switch up shampoo <3 hope you find something that works. I've also been having the same issue with dry shampoos btw.
1508 2018-05-06 20:09:27 Hao doesn't Olive oil work?
1509 2018-05-06 20:09:10 1. You assume that these improvements wouldn't have been made without federal regulations.  I see no evidence for this.

2.  You provide no link between our decrease in oil consumption and a decrease in climate change.  Seems suspicious.

3.  You ignore all the negative results.
1510 2018-05-06 20:09:05 whose oil do you think you're using to get around in every motor vehicle you use?
1511 2018-05-06 20:08:55 Also, on a scale from 1 to oil, how oily is your skin exactly?
1512 2018-05-06 20:08:52 Mexican grocery stores are food deserts. I'm in the Yucatan and people only cook with vegetable oil, no coconut?

Not a surprise Mexican obesity rates are pushing past American.

The H will be supplied from fossils / Oil companies. We have two Teslas and soon 4 in the family and will never go back.
1518 2018-05-06 20:07:09 Tried that. :/ I think I'm just going to have to wash it out.

Argan oil does seem good for preventing razor burn, though, if I have to shave dry for any reason.
1519 2018-05-06 20:06:45 @Colttrain48 : “You’re getting your oil changed? Let me pick you up, let’s go to a bar.” Also @Colttrain48 “we need to go I don’t want you driving to late” OK DAD.
1520 2018-05-06 20:06:28 Please stick to taking care of Tesla; I just voted to keep you on as Chair.  As for Warren B - he needs to build moats around all the towns that his Explosive Bakken Crude Oil Trains roll through-- he has total disregard for the planet and humanity
1521 2018-05-06 20:06:13 Mmmm sounds good bby I come be your oil boy Tiffany
1522 2018-05-06 20:05:57 And there favorite line is well you won’t win or your wasting a vote, well yes because the lot of you would rather be a follower even if they are corrupt. Can we say Bush? Does JFK sound familiar?  Or Bushes oil empire.  We need more than a 2 party system, we honest decent people
1523 2018-05-06 20:05:49 Can't help remembering the Lotto ad with the 'American lawyer' type at the pool 'he was loaded "until the oil ran out" Westminster offers a sliding scale and then its €11bn or c20% of total government spending to be found again.
1524 2018-05-06 20:05:41 idk how people still put on tanning oil ...
1525 2018-05-06 20:05:32 Yeah no. Science is not a religion it’s a method of investigation. I’m pretty sure you’ll find it was oil companies that killed electric cars. They are bad for business ya see. But I’m not going to make you suddenly join the real world so, have a nice day. Muted.
1526 2018-05-06 20:05:24 Oil is just boneless dinosaurs
1527 2018-05-06 20:04:17 ...
The oil did not complain
1528 2018-05-06 20:04:04 So with that being said, my coconut oil is starting to solidify again and it feels 10 times better. All is well in Atlanta today #teamspencer
1529 2018-05-06 20:04:03 @TheCarlyleHotel what is the name of the artist of the lovely paintings in the lobby? I thought they were charcoal at first and was amazed that they are oil in canvas.
1530 2018-05-06 20:04:02 How would you feel about dynamic entries such as helicopter repelling in or coming out of the water for an oil rig map? or even more, preaching options like kicking the door down, crowbar, doorknob Charge, breaching shotgun etc?  @Matimi0
1531 2018-05-06 20:03:55 sweet bring tanning oil/lotion
1532 2018-05-06 20:03:51 I had been trying to get into the Harry Potter books awhile, but they just didn’t work for me until the night the power went out and my living room was lit by candles and oil lamps, my cat perched on the edge of the couch, keeping watch as I started reading until the wee hours...
1533 2018-05-06 20:03:42 Like wmds and the oil will pay for the war.
1534 2018-05-06 20:03:33 so @DazM1971 has just asked me to ask you what the sporran is used for? 
1535 2018-05-06 20:02:44 The large majority of #PalmOil is not #RSPO ! 
It is a cheap, easily accessible oil that companies use.
Personally at this critical time with the issues over #KillerPalm I boycott ALL.
As vegans we have a responsibility to raise awareness not just for animals but for the planet

Dinner : pork loin in olive oil and lemon
1539 2018-05-06 20:02:00 Turns out that argan oil just makes my hair look like it hasn't been washed in 3 days. Welp, call it a learning experience and put the oil on the "Stuff I Won't Buy Again" list.
1540 2018-05-06 20:01:22 There are 145 million people in Russia and an economy no bigger than Italy’s. Under Putin, it has wasted an opportunity to invest and diversify its economy and is now overdependent on oil & gas exports. It’s mired in corruption & is stagnating. Talking tough is all it’s got left.

1544 2018-05-06 20:01:03 I did did my normal routine! A scrub, black soap, witch hazel, rose water, and then instead of my normal night cream I did rosehip oil instead!

1549 2018-05-06 19:59:53 Certainly at the bottom pot, harvesting the oil money
1550 2018-05-06 19:59:51 Well logically and literally speaking, we’re walking bags of organic chemical elements. Solid state chemical machines. The ingredients matter. When a car needs oil or fuel, the chemical makeup and properties of those items, matters. Same thing with supplements and food.

1556 2018-05-06 19:59:09 I'm lucky to be served by an energy from waste plant, so I know I'm getting a second use from stuff like that before it goes to be burned for electricity, displacing at least the oil, if not the energy, used in it's manufacture.

1559 2018-05-06 19:58:55 I'm behind you 100% Megan, but Mattress Mary hates gay people. She hates poor people, she hates teachers, she hates POC. She will never, ever do the right thing by anyone other than big oil and her own trashy spawn. She's delighted in destroying our state. She is VILE.
1560 2018-05-06 19:58:52 Bloody Hell - who's drinking the oil - or have you got an old Vauxhall????????
1561 2018-05-06 19:58:51 The market will only grow, when types like Musk light a fire under sleeping/lazy auto/gas/oil/energy companies, who would rather drag their feet, when it comes to tech development.

1564 2018-05-06 19:58:25 Imagine the bundles of cash that have been thrown around by Saudi/Gulf states that these so called leaders were meant to divvy up. Then you've got all the looting, oil sales & various other rackets.
1565 2018-05-06 19:58:19 did you put anything else on with it or just rosehip oil???
1566 2018-05-06 19:58:02 I cooked 1 dl of quinoa separately. Then I fried the salmon in olive oil for a while, added a sliced paprika and lemon-black pepper. Enter the salmon was mostly done, I added a dollop of cream cheese and another of blue cheese. When the cheese had melted I poured in the quinoa
1567 2018-05-06 19:57:57 coconut oil, aloe vera, coco butter, and rose water are daily essentials.
1568 2018-05-06 19:57:33 Pretty sure I’m shrinking from being off carbs. Went the Keto route & just starting to add MCT oil to my coffee. It’s supposed to improve brain function too... so let me know if I appear sharper/smarter cus I will prob be distracted with equations/philosophy.
1569 2018-05-06 19:57:12 Thanks Carol. Had a good week up until yesterday. Planned to get freon and an oil change but had to replace the compressor. When turning on the a/c it made humming noises and blowing out hot air. Had to pay $940 after I had him knock off $100. At least everything works.
1570 2018-05-06 19:57:06 @Amway why fish oil soft gels are not available on your site and when it will be available or should i go for another brand ?? #AmwayIndia

1572 2018-05-06 19:56:37 Met a very nice lady today who gave me some water based oil paints to try as well as brushes and told me about the Art Club at Challney School. Luton is the place to stay if you want to live around decent folks. Def going to give the Art Club a go on Weds.
1573 2018-05-06 19:56:35 Bio oil

1576 2018-05-06 19:56:13 These Facebook ads are so cringe. Reminds me of that South park episode when the oil company says "we're sorry" over and over. Such bullshit
1577 2018-05-06 19:56:10 Get your gas and oil from US 
US net exporter and Trump proffered as much in speech in Poland last year. 
Good luck.
1578 2018-05-06 19:55:47 Yes, ths Island is beautiful... A lot of History. It was a pirate island and now is all oil industry. Literally there are like cities in open sea (huge oil plataforms). The 70% of oil of Mexico come from here. 
1579 2018-05-06 19:55:42 Bout to do this oil change on Big Quis.....might bend a couple blocks in him
1580 2018-05-06 19:55:40 Kanu Nwankwo flew to London to be there. David Dein showed up for the first time in 11 years.

But the shiny bearded Legend with a statue outside the Emirates preferred to wank to celebration of a title won by the Oil Farmers club in December. 

It will be well with him

1583 2018-05-06 19:55:06 I guess all it takes is a little sun for me to get back to being crunchy AF. 

Once again I'm making coconut oil scrubs and all about that fruit-infused water and raw almonds life.

1600 2018-05-06 19:51:50 First they came for Oil and Gas, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not an oil and gas worker
Then they came for the dairy farmers and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a dairy farmer
Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me...
1601 2018-05-06 19:51:48 I use coconut oil as primer just thought I’d share that
1602 2018-05-06 19:51:32 moisturize with a body oil then go in with a lotion, thank me later ladies
1603 2018-05-06 19:51:32 All of the oil companies are owned by bankers now through loans, this is just another banker subsidy paid for by US Taxpayers.
1604 2018-05-06 19:51:16 So did we find oil fr or nah?

1606 2018-05-06 19:50:59 I’m really thankful that @MLBTV works on store WiFi while I’m getting an oil change. On the other hand, @Indians are about to blow a 4-0 lead in the bottom of the 8th to the Evil Empire (aka Yankees). People are watching me freak and I am providing great entertainment.
1607 2018-05-06 19:50:59 That won't be necessary.. I'm calm like palm oil..

1609 2018-05-06 19:50:55 Which hazel, I get the alcohol free so it doesn’t dry your face out; also rosehip seed oil is great for dark marks, acne scars, redness, dryness.
1610 2018-05-06 19:50:51 Your favourite politician is not campaigning for president/governor/senator/rep to govern or represent you. They are campaigning to be the ones with continued access to the Niger Delta oil money shared monthly. It is why you can die in dozens and they'll carry on campaigning
1611 2018-05-06 19:50:34 SENATOR WITHIN 20 YEARS IF MOST AUTOS BECOME ELECTRIC OUR NATION'S CONSUMPTION OF ELECTRICITY WILL TRIPLE !WE MUST START NOW WITH ADDING RENEWABLES ENERGY SOURCES WE CANNOT BUILD MORE NUCLEAR REACTORS OR OIL OR GAS POWER; THIS OUTSIDE EVERY MAJOR CITY!

1614 2018-05-06 19:49:54 Raleigh started falling right before he turned nine. I remembered that coconut oil was good for Alzheimer patients. Started giving it to him and he stopped falling. Forgot and he started again. Three times...not a coincidence. After awhile, I took him off of it. Then lately he...
1615 2018-05-06 19:49:31 Ameen ya Allah
1616 2018-05-06 19:49:26 Reminds of similar techniques used to extinguish oil well fires with high explosives.

1619 2018-05-06 19:48:57 Not to like lose my positivity or anything but there is a dude at the gate having a full on convo with his musician friend on speakerphone about cbd oil and I want to grab the phone from his hands and smash it.
1620 2018-05-06 19:48:38 I get out at 5 though and I need to change the oil on my car lol
1621 2018-05-06 19:48:31 The dirtiest tar pit oil on the planet running through  our countryside & national forest. Ships out of our ports to China. We get 35 permanent jobs but mostly it lines the Koch's pockets. Google the Alberta pipeline leaks.
China has the only refinery that can deal with dirty oil
1622 2018-05-06 19:48:04 Good God man are you ever going to speak out against Zionists and Israel. They are clearly terrorists. Why lie? You're looking like a fool that sold his soul to the devil aka Murdoch/Rothchild/Genie oil.
1623 2018-05-06 19:47:55 The earthquake occurred 60 miles from the drill point of @BP_plc operation that caused the terrible oil spill a few years ago. The deep drilling has made the salt ridges unstable. It was said we in FL should be prepared for the possibility of an earthquake, too.
1624 2018-05-06 19:47:42 Don’t forget con artist and snake oil salesman
1625 2018-05-06 19:47:33 You mean the Alaska you just opened up oil drilling in you fucking ass neck
1626 2018-05-06 19:47:23 Do you need an oil cartridge today? Harmony oil cartridges are 10% off!
1627 2018-05-06 19:47:21 If you actually want an answer here too: the microbes attach to their food source so if dilbit is on the bottom they happily reside there & metabolize it. If oil molecules are disbursed in the water column the archaea bind to them there too. They follow plumes and food sources.
1628 2018-05-06 19:46:57 I’m faithful to the oil that’s my number 1 
1629 2018-05-06 19:46:56 US & EU illegal sanctions against Russia backfired on so many levels. Russia has become virtually self sufficient agriculturally whilst EU produce rots, their banking sector has acquired the skills & tech to sell sovereign bonds & an alt to SWIFT is in the offing. Gas&Oil go east
1630 2018-05-06 19:46:56 I need me one of them Oil diffuser shits
1631 2018-05-06 19:46:55 @WBCMediaContact Hi WBC i was wondering if you could post these signs on your wbcsigns account: Dykes wed with Rosie and ellen, Fag troops with rainbow army sergent, Gods Curse breast cancer, Fag nation, and gods curse oil spill. they are my favorite signs
1632 2018-05-06 19:46:50 MSM enjoy pandering to each other. They are each other’s biggest fans. It’s called the DC-NYC bubble.

1636 2018-05-06 19:46:25 But Bob wants to fry them in superheated oil!
1637 2018-05-06 19:46:20 When God anointed you with His Holy Spirit, He didn't give you a spirit of timidity or fear. The oil that descended upon you is the spirit of love, power and self-control (see 2 Tim. 1:7).
1638 2018-05-06 19:46:08 When God anointed you with His Holy Spirit, He didn't give you a spirit of timidity or fear. The oil that descended upon you is the spirit of love, power and self-control (see 2 Tim. 1:7).
1639 2018-05-06 19:46:00 I really needed this hair oil though. *sigh*. I’m ready for a nap.
1640 2018-05-06 19:45:53 {willfully refrigerates sesame oil BEFORE opening}
1641 2018-05-06 19:45:50 That's why it's still good after all these years....Don't fret.... 50/50 raw Linseed Oil/White spirit mix to keep it nourished will do it....use sparingly( it will soak in) . It will smell for a bit though.
1642 2018-05-06 19:45:46 Combine 2 1/2 pints jelly / jam with 1/3 cup chocolate. Sprinkle with Olive Oil. Boil. Serve over kale.
1643 2018-05-06 19:45:34 When your petrol lawnmower smokes, splutters oil and conks out. That’s it dead, right?
1644 2018-05-06 19:45:13 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1645 2018-05-06 19:44:49 Oh boi.. Bring out the body oil. 
1646 2018-05-06 19:44:48 Well...that was very interesting...long but I couldn't turn Dan off, it was sooo informative from nerotoxins to palm oil to coral reefs..."No honour in dishonourable work" ...everything was really making sense...excellent ..I have noted his org.I love stuff like this
1647 2018-05-06 19:44:34 What kind of oil did she use? Asking for a friend. 
1648 2018-05-06 19:44:34 For me it was never about the titles. It's about what Arsenal represents. Class, harmony, sportsmanship, professionalism and compassion. I would never trade what we stand for, for oil money and a couple of league titles.
1649 2018-05-06 19:44:27 Thirsty broads on this thread.

1657 2018-05-06 19:42:42 It's noted that when oil price was at 114 dollars a barrel the GEJ administration didn't build Lagos-Ibadan expressway, they ate the money and they want to come back. To do what abeg? All these looters, there's God ooo. @APCUKingdom @OfficialPDPNig @OfficialAPCNg @akandeoj
1658 2018-05-06 19:42:35 Took the wife’s car to get its oil changed and the skip plate is being held on by fucking zip ties. What kind of fresh hell have I gotten myself into?

1661 2018-05-06 19:42:10 First olive oil, then a mix out of garlic, green pepper, salt, paprika.
1662 2018-05-06 19:41:52 I hope youre using a type of oil thats digestible for the squirrel as it may end up licking and swallowing some of it ????and yes Im serious .

1671 2018-05-06 19:39:59 Middle East has only one religion islam and they dont grow food (more important than oil) any reply. @JagratiShukla29 @ggiittiikkaa
1672 2018-05-06 19:39:45 Over 50% of Venezuelan GDP is based on petroleum. That industry is "publicly" owned I.E. government.
Thier government has messed up their economy so bad that they can't even burrow money to pay for shipping the oil to be refined. 
But yeah it should all be " publicly" owned.
1673 2018-05-06 19:39:31 I'd love to cover your naked body in oil all over your naked body
1674 2018-05-06 19:39:19 Saudi Arabia anyone?
Clearly not committing war crimes in Oman, a worse tragedy than Syria. 'Clearly not' because they buy £billions of our weapons. They're our allies, apparently. Human rights specialists.
Have they any oil?
1675 2018-05-06 19:39:09 Obama lied. No such thing as snap back of sanctions. Europeans making too much money now. Even in U.S restricting Boeing sales is an issue
1676 2018-05-06 19:39:06 Also interesting
Rosneft oil in Dossier happened
Many layers
Nobody will touch it
1677 2018-05-06 19:39:00 Dude some of these cars that be coming in here Aint even worth the oil change take it to the junk yard 
1678 2018-05-06 19:38:54 No problem 
I usually do it 2-3 times a we month. 
Directly on the hair, it's a tad too heavy for scalp application. With your scalp use light oils. Like olive oil.
1679 2018-05-06 19:38:43 Hey so if you're still feeling stuffy, might I recommend a steam bath? We just did one and feel so much better. And if you can get eucalyptus or thieves oil, even better 
1680 2018-05-06 19:38:21 Argan oil helps with the frizz as well!
1681 2018-05-06 19:38:10 I was not suggesting pot! Oh know,,, you know the jacked up stuff one smokes from a “ oil pipe”

1687 2018-05-06 19:37:36 This clown will still be a snake oil salesmen as he draws his final breath's, has always been nothing but a conman posing as a minister

1692 2018-05-06 19:37:14 Insanity.

1694 2018-05-06 19:36:23 Realize that job numbers may go down slightly. 
Labor pool is much smaller than it was.
Now to focus on couch potatoes, ppl out of workforce
1695 2018-05-06 19:36:00 They’d be running around on the ground, the oil would have dirt sticking to the oil which will then slough off eventually. Not much danger there for the amount of oil we’re talking about.
1696 2018-05-06 19:35:49 yea im not have to get on my hands and knees and scrub the tub because someone else decided to use oil
1697 2018-05-06 19:35:40 Finally I start working on my old Ducati. needs to replace a fuel pump inside a gas tank! also  replace a battery, tire, brake & clutch oil, etc.
1698 2018-05-06 19:35:39 @oil_guns_merica she can cook slide in her dms
1699 2018-05-06 19:35:32 Let's face it: margarine, sunflower spread, abused vegetable oil... Just eat butter and use less of it. Margarine is for fattening turkeys.
1700 2018-05-06 19:35:29 I used to be able to change and tire, change my oil and fill up my radiator  all before the Spurs would put up a shot every possession lmao
1701 2018-05-06 19:35:19 Hence the largest reserves in the world statement I made; it’s a well known fact. I work in the oil sector.
1702 2018-05-06 19:35:07 Are you sure people are short oil because of reflation, or if they have looked at the production data, and trend, from around the world? Long dollar has been / looks great. Dollar debt / assets also still good for Sterling investors, which is just off top of range.
1703 2018-05-06 19:35:04 @INCIndia Pakoda tastes best if Fried in Adani's Refined Groundnut Oil & Reliance Cooking Gas
1704 2018-05-06 19:34:55 My point wasn’t that birds can’t go vertical, it’s that while doing it, there is no feasible scenario where they will be able to pick up enough oil on their feathers from an oiled post to have any deleterious effects.
1705 2018-05-06 19:34:48 I was with those raising concern about the people of Halabja and the Marsh Arabs when we were denigrated as loony lefties because our Government supported and armed Saddam. He was our guy. Our bulwark against Iran. Genocide? Nothing to see here.
Then he threatened "our" oil.
1706 2018-05-06 19:34:40 Looks so nice Delia! X
1707 2018-05-06 19:34:36 Did anyone happen to notice a HIGHLY disturbing trend in the Gulf of Mexico this morning? 
We are pulling oil out too fast, too deep.
There was a 4.6 richter scale earthquake, south of Louisiana, near newest deep water drill & transport rig.
What will it take for us to learn?
1708 2018-05-06 19:34:31 If you like portobello mushrooms, you can do a LOT with those. Grilled I like a marinade of olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, and oregano.  Use em for a sandwich with paperback cheese & tomato.  16 bean soup, tons of protein there....
1709 2018-05-06 19:34:22 His staffing choices sabotaged our only means to address these other problems. Myanmar? Trump chose an oil exec for SoS. Climate change? Scott Pruitt is head of EPA. Opioids? HHS secretary is former president of Eli Lily. He's replaced every tool we have with illegal fireworks.
1710 2018-05-06 19:34:16 Friend oil sounds like a cursed condiment 

like imagine frying food with the grease of someone’s oily skin or hair

1714 2018-05-06 19:32:38 The shorelines of our lakes once the ice is melted, makes me cry. I'd do a documentary if I had the energy to afford this project. 

Good sportsman care about our natural resources, they dont dump jugs of oil in the woods or leave dirty diapers. Its sheer laziness!
1715 2018-05-06 19:32:33 like who uses CDs? what a snake oil salesman
1716 2018-05-06 19:32:21 Analysts See $0.05 EPS for TORC Oil & Gas Ltd. (TO...
1717 2018-05-06 19:32:07 While those last two factors are significant, the biggest one (that is rarely discussed & NEVER acknowledged) is gouging - plain & simple. Even if you subtract the #transitlevy & #carbontax , YVR prices bare no relation to world price of oil. 
#cdnpoli
1718 2018-05-06 19:32:07 Did you end up watching it then? That documentary will stay in my head for a long time. That shit is real and should serve as a warning to anyone to think twice about the consequences that can come from performing any rituals. It's all fun and games until oil drips frm ur blinds!
1719 2018-05-06 19:32:05 Sweet Classic Terrine // First, mix an avocado and 5 L of aged onion oil. Deep fry for 1 second. Finally, sprinkle with 150 grams of caramel. Decorate with 3 pinches of caviar.

こんな時間にすいませんOIL
1727 2018-05-06 19:30:24 We know about your plot, we know about your willingness to keep Iran in precarious position, we know about your oil interest, we know about your terrorist activity, and your several attempts of overthrow the power in the middle East region.
1728 2018-05-06 19:29:45 No lie! now they’ve crescent star, little minaret lights, mini light up mosques & oil lamps
1729 2018-05-06 19:29:44 Guy u used indomie to cook oil
1730 2018-05-06 19:29:31 And they wonder why no one cares about the scandals they create.
1731 2018-05-06 19:29:15 4/  It wasn't until the northern industrial base had sufficiently shifted to oil that cotton became less important.  The North changed and thr anti slavery movement took over.
1732 2018-05-06 19:29:06 I'm not for the retwisting of my hair today. I will oil and maybe throw some braids in it. That's that.
1733 2018-05-06 19:29:05 I think the cotton wool with peppermint oil on, which I left out to scare off the mouse, has been munched on- by the mouse.
1734 2018-05-06 19:28:52 Thanks for reminding us to pick up more chain blade oil

1736 2018-05-06 19:28:27 God, I remember going to parties in crowded cars, with the windows wide open. Improperly cured Afghan coats and the dreaded patchouli oil.
1737 2018-05-06 19:28:18 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,
because once Kyu incorrectly entered oil when
cooking a simple ham.
1738 2018-05-06 19:28:15 Unpopular opinion: Coconut oil is trash, & the worst possible oil you could use. 
1739 2018-05-06 19:28:11 Regular wash/co wash day
Massage scalp with my essential oils mix
Shampoo with heads & shoulders
Deep condition with mega growth deep conditioner 
Then use Garnier’s Fructis damage eraser
Towel dry
Apply acv and castor oil
1740 2018-05-06 19:28:04 But it's like 50% friend oil, 50% actual meat. It feels gross after finishing it all.
1741 2018-05-06 19:27:53 I still have sebamed for my face, 3k but I’m testing the coconut oil for my face
1742 2018-05-06 19:27:20 There's supposed to be no such thing as bad publicity, when it comes to sales (it's not true, as anybody with a malfunctioning oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico could tell you), but it certainly raises your profile.
I'm going to have to read through to get the history and facts, here
1743 2018-05-06 19:27:06 Then why are oil prices and gas prices going so high so fast!  Prices were so much more stable with Obama!
Trump is screwing up our economy BIGLY!
1744 2018-05-06 19:27:03 Trump Train is Rolling !!!

1747 2018-05-06 19:26:43 In bed with an ice pack on my neck, meds taken, essential oils on my temples and some CBD oil in my system. Let's see if any of it will get rid of this headache...
1748 2018-05-06 19:26:39 Sometimes I run groundnut oil self... That's after my mum must have stopped me from going out without cream.....

1750 2018-05-06 19:26:15 Do you know more the 500 thousand people died in that war? For OIL
1751 2018-05-06 19:26:13 i usually cover myself in baby oil, let it soak in and then use sugar to buff it off in a bath/shower 
1752 2018-05-06 19:26:07 Ready for a day off. Last 6 weeks been mental - and still dropped quad in for service. If can get a moment maybe end of week, but will ring first. Not much wrong, change the oil and kick the tyres . Diff lock wasn't engaging a while back is only thing I can think of.
1753 2018-05-06 19:25:57 Unpopular opinion: grease, oil, diesel, and gas smell amazing
1754 2018-05-06 19:25:53 Apparently in the US they deep fry turkeys in barrels of oil.
1755 2018-05-06 19:25:33 Nope. RPM is more than the engine can take on top gear without an oil change. Risk of burnout and engine seizure.
1756 2018-05-06 19:25:32 No all in oil :)
1757 2018-05-06 19:25:31 Thats a GIVEN. xxxxxxxxx

1759 2018-05-06 19:25:17 I got block chain projects in Poland and I have emerging microbial projects
out of Texas which increase marijuana efficiency growth, waste management, and gas and oil
1760 2018-05-06 19:25:10 Seriously. Dude thinks we have a crisis of leadership while unemployment is at an 18-year low. Amazing

1768 2018-05-06 19:22:41 when there's no credible statistics abuse is inevitable:
how much food does Benue State produce to support the food security of Nigeria? is the insecurity in the state threatening this base or oil money is available to provide buffer

1772 2018-05-06 19:21:38 Cy loves u! Get some black oil sunflower seeds & love him back!!
1773 2018-05-06 19:21:37 It has nothing to do with the oil companies. They have never destroyed anything ever.
1774 2018-05-06 19:21:34 I'm sure the price of gasoline soaring like it is has absolutely nothing to do with warmer weather coming on and oil companies knowing more people will be out and about driving, so that they can inflate prices higher and higher. #pricegouging
1775 2018-05-06 19:21:23 Don the con is a snake oil salesman with the morals of a cat in heat & the ethics of a crack whore. Cutting Corp taxes & destroying the EPA are not accomplishments. He appointments pro fetus judges, fights his bases culture war & pretends to be a Christian. He's 100% FAKE!!!

1790 2018-05-06 19:19:54  ima oil up next time
1791 2018-05-06 19:19:23 I know most people don’t remember when the floor price for wool was ripped away and the consequence was brutal. But what would you know of the plight of agriculture all snuggled up in your plastics and fluffies derived from multi national oil companies. It’s all bullshit.

1796 2018-05-06 19:18:44 i don’t know whether this is too late but either lemon juice or baby oil and sugar 
1797 2018-05-06 19:18:37 Bio oil I've heard helps,plus hard work

That mixture save lives
1799 2018-05-06 19:17:51 It’s bigger than politics. History will judge this degenerate for his selling out her country to the big donors and corps for a little Alaskan oil money. That would keep me up at night and I’m not even a politician!
1800 2018-05-06 19:17:37 135$ for an oil changee you dumbb cuh!!
1801 2018-05-06 19:17:26 All it cost me was buying a Jeep techs oil for his Scion xD from Autozone.  I’d say $35.
1802 2018-05-06 19:17:17 If you need me to explain why breaking down like that during *boot camp* is a bad sign, you need a goddamn reality check.

1841 2018-05-06 19:12:43 This huckster joke of a doctor goes on his old timely medicine show and promotes snake oil, and it's gotten him in trouble more than once.

1. More stupid, not “stupider” 2. Your methods for sharing your “knowledge” on oil and birds, however pointless, encourages laughter more than support.
1845 2018-05-06 19:12:21 I bought some new oil lastnight
1846 2018-05-06 19:12:19 @HarryRamsdensUK do you use vegetable oil to fry in ? Do you use beer batter ?

Yep, that's a potato chip. 
1871 2018-05-06 19:09:15 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.
1872 2018-05-06 19:09:03 Frozen foods yes imo...these breasts I just cooked were like 25 min so not much diff in time. I think the main point of it is to have fried foods with less oil/fat.
1873 2018-05-06 19:09:01 So this is a controversial suggestion but it worked for me; EXTERNAL belly massage with pennyroyal oil. Use in a carrier oil and NEVER ingest or use internally.

1879 2018-05-06 19:07:56 Oh,@Amy_Siskind, you said the same thing when George W. Bush pretended the Iraqis had chemical weapons so he could start a war to keep oil prices cheap, which, two decades and a hundred thousand human deaths later, has more than doubled the price of oil. So you're probably right.

1885 2018-05-06 19:07:20 The huge tactical DNC mistake was letting that grandstanding unaccomplished fraud, life long Independent Sanders borrow the party to raise his profile by selling snake oil to a bunch of low info dipshits, sleaze his way out of releasing his taxes, enriching himself in the process

1888 2018-05-06 19:07:09 When Trump ran for President he said he was not beholden to anyone as he had his own money. HA - One of his biggest lies as he is on the take from the NRA and many other contributors; like oil and big corporations that he is allowing to ruin our air quality and waterways.

1903 2018-05-06 19:04:13 Ok that new to me and yes this feminist revolution crap is like they want men to be gay or something. And that's just not a man. I grew up and worked in the oil fields as a roughneck those are men not sissy boys.

1913 2018-05-06 19:01:56 I'm neither for nor against new projects. That's up to oil sands producers to decide based upon their internal economics. I support expanded supply of de-carbonized Alberta oil sands heavy crude. Whether greenfield or brownfield makes no difference.
1914 2018-05-06 19:01:51 But it is! It reminds me of one of my favorite baseball nicknames...Oil Can Boyd, pitcher for the Red Sox.

clearly they favour oil, sand and camels more than the truth
1937 2018-05-06 18:59:52 It's hard to get people to shift their context from the cost of a liter of spring water or Starbucks coffee to a barrel of oil. A barrel of oil contains ~4.5 years of manual labor for one person in calories or kwH. No equivalent to that!

1954 2018-05-06 18:56:58 LOL...The Alberta govt, and Energi News, supports expanding oil sands heavy crude supply. The energy economists I interview regularly expect the additional 1.3MM b/d to come from brownfield expansions, which HSBC says it will finance if declining carbon-intensity. Clear enough?
1955 2018-05-06 18:56:54 its oil based

1972 2018-05-06 18:52:25 Iraqi Supreme Federal Court postponed the hearing of KRG and Iraq officials on the former's oil sales to after elections. Who says Iraqi court decisions are not political?
1973 2018-05-06 18:52:18 This is what happens when you try to make Brooklyn BBQ a thing.
1974 2018-05-06 18:52:16 What kind of oil?
1975 2018-05-06 18:51:55 They have a black castor oil one? Interesting.
1976 2018-05-06 18:51:41 All original ...come across it on a daily basis.
 If you want to strip it fine but you must oil it else it'll split.
1977 2018-05-06 18:51:33 Wow. I took a full dropper of CBD oil, what? 10 mins ago. Migraine fucking gone. Poof!
1978 2018-05-06 18:51:33 Negative review time:
Used a coupon for a $20 oil change at Firestone. Over 2 hours later they try to tell me I need all new tires even though I had two replaced yesterday. YESTERDAY!! Last time I ever come here, I’ll just do it myself next time 
1979 2018-05-06 18:51:18 I’ve mixed them in with some grated carrot, olive oil and red vinegar for a side. Hoping it’s nice...
1980 2018-05-06 18:51:01 Getting my oil changed then I'll head that way 
1981 2018-05-06 18:50:40 Aberdeen the  city that kept UK afloat for decades with its oil sector has had only one trainline heading north since 1960s & only now in 2018 are they getting round to dualling the whole line. That’s what underinvestment means, if we had only a fraction spent on us as London.
1982 2018-05-06 18:50:35 Obviously that included an oil change and complete auto detailing. Say it’s so Melissa, say it’s so.
1983 2018-05-06 18:50:23 Thanks for posting this...reminds me I need to change the oil in my lawn mower.
1984 2018-05-06 18:50:03 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
1985 2018-05-06 18:50:03 Russia & China threaten the petro $ by their gold backed trading currency. Iraq-Saddam sold oil 4 euros. Libya,Ghadaffi wanted to back pan-African currency w gold. Shun the petro $ expect the US military. Syria also dropped the USD. China,Russia economic threat,not military
1986 2018-05-06 18:49:50 To add sir, 
8) He brought relative peace to Niger Delta Region via amnesty program
9) He introduced the monthly amnesty allowances to repented Niger Delta fighters
10) Raised the quantity of crude oil barrel produced daily to over 2 million.
1987 2018-05-06 18:49:39 @bastilledan come to canada
1988 2018-05-06 18:49:16 Yeah it’s nuts from fireworks poppers to Football and volleyball launch to oil cans to Flying food and more nuts is definitely the right word
1989 2018-05-06 18:49:09 oh!イル
1990 2018-05-06 18:48:53 man i can’t tell y’all how excited i am for the venom movie, that walking oil slick is my entire childhood
1991 2018-05-06 18:48:47 Should have cleaned it out before hand, or maybe they could have cleaned it out along with your "free"oil change....lol
1992 2018-05-06 18:48:26 It’s 100% better that the Whale Oil we used to put in our margarine .
1993 2018-05-06 18:48:07 well, after my lovely cleansing demonstration, I went to get the full sized products and was sold the wrong facial oil (lotus instead of orchid) - Debenhams won't exchange it, can you help? Seems a waste to have an entire bottle I can't use (not for my skin type)
1994 2018-05-06 18:48:07 Just put a surtax on Mexican goods They export a lot of oil
1995 2018-05-06 18:47:49 The Obama judge that keeps screwing with Trump's EOs.
1996 2018-05-06 18:47:40 I have a shirt I do the same thing withh !! And I have pants that I wipe my fingers in from my oil pastels
1997 2018-05-06 18:47:08 Forgive me for jumping in but it does deoe d also on the opportunities you create for yourself based on what you have to offer. If you just randomly move to Toronto, for example, and you're skilled in oil and gas, you WILL relocate to Alberta sooner than a year

1999 2018-05-06 18:46:46 I’ve been crying since 11 in the morning. I cried through an entire oil change and car wash. Now I’m sitting in target parking lot crying before I go in.  Clearly in my fucking prime.
2000 2018-05-06 18:46:46 We have to be more conscious about everything we consume. It's only since we started to properly label things that 'veg oil' now has to be shown as palm oil.
2001 2018-05-06 18:46:30 Oil changes lowkey expensive asl
2002 2018-05-06 18:46:13 If you use wipes be careful they can strip your skin, but are nice for tough spots. Any type of oil base make-up remover is good for picking the make-up off, but just be careful with how much you use because it can cause a break out (my sensitive skin) I gotchu 
2003 2018-05-06 18:46:08 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
2004 2018-05-06 18:46:04 At a time about 2-3 minutes until golden and crisp. Drain well on paper towels. (Don't over crowd the pot when frying to help keep oil hot. Key to success is to cook them hot and fast.) if you like spicy, the jalapeno vetsipn is delish with a spicy dipping sauce.
2005 2018-05-06 18:46:01 They need some shea butter and coconut oil 
2006 2018-05-06 18:46:00 facts lmao they just go into the mf oil

2012 2018-05-06 18:45:08 "Live each day as though it were your last" is just plain foolishness. Who would ever have their teeth cleaned or their oil changed? #wisdom

2015 2018-05-06 18:44:45 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

2032 2018-05-06 18:41:55 I do oil painting. Put on music. Super relaxing, can just focus on that for a bit and forget about everything else. Good for the mind and soul.
2033 2018-05-06 18:41:35 Heat about 3" oil to 350° F.
While heating, whisk all dry stuff together in bowl. In another bowl whisk together buttermilk and egg (plus optional stuff). Fold wet into dry to combine, but don't overmix. Use a small ice cream scoop or large spoon to drop into oil. Fry small batch

2051 2018-05-06 18:39:03 Also none of them brought up olive oil so idk where he getting that from. As if other things can't be made into oil.
2052 2018-05-06 18:38:58 i never even think am but ya probably right. palm oil is , country too.
2053 2018-05-06 18:38:56 My skin amazes me, doesn’t tan, I put baby oil on, doesn’t burn, gonna be like Casper forever
2054 2018-05-06 18:38:51 Right you are.
I think you'll find the only coercing was done by Salmond & Sturgeon. With their blue-print that was about as reliable as the bible, no answers on the currency, and blatant lies on the oil reserves, but i don't believe Yes voters cared as their minds were made.
2055 2018-05-06 18:38:39 Epcot > Coconut Oil
2056 2018-05-06 18:38:33 First you’ve got to train the squirrels to climb the bird feeder, THEN oil it. It’s a long con, but worth it.

2059 2018-05-06 18:37:28 That ‘scenic’ ND paradise is in many places just an oil pipeline crack away from disaster thanks to politicians more interested in making a buck than in conserving Nature. Native Americans understand the threat so they’ve been arrested and removed.
2060 2018-05-06 18:37:06 I just started using CBD oil and it’s awesome for my pain and anxiety. I mix in into my kratom in the morning and feel my pain melt away as I sip.

2067 2018-05-06 18:36:14 It's a combination of potato peels, kosher salt, and canola oil. It's what the manufacturer recommends for first-time seasoning.
2068 2018-05-06 18:36:05 Do you change your oil regularly?

Nothing feels as good as laying out in the sun with coconut oil in your hair. (Sunscreen of course, Silly! Banana scented sunscreen!) 

Soak Up the Sun at any size. Embrace your summer body at any size. You are sexy & BEAUTIFUL at any size.   
2087 2018-05-06 18:32:42 I hope you like civ updates because here's another. Took over another city state and took two cities from two different civs. I also have almost all the oil. World War 1 broke out against me but no one was able to do anything against me.
2088 2018-05-06 18:32:20 Oh my god y’all if you are having tummy troubles rub peppermint oil on your stomach in a clockwise motion and holy wow it helps
2089 2018-05-06 18:31:57 Gonna take CBD oil instead of the ibprophen and see what that does. Smh pharmaceuticals are a trap.
2090 2018-05-06 18:31:56 After making my own deduction, only now i realized why the election has to be on wednesday. Because that is the day when the oil price gonna change..
2091 2018-05-06 18:31:51 The NDP does not support a cap on development. I challenge you to demonstrate that it does. I have interviews with cabinet ministers to demonstrate it is fully supportive of the growth in supply of 1.3MM b/d of oil sands heavy crude by 2030. I. HAVE. EVIDENCE. Do you?
2092 2018-05-06 18:31:31 and it is still going on each day of the year. We lose money for the Canadian economy by underselling our oil because we cannot get it to int'l markets. Idiotic and self-punitive. The Americans love it though.
2093 2018-05-06 18:31:28 After i get this oil changed and go finish cleaning up im going for a walk

2106 2018-05-06 18:30:05 Well, I'll try to look at some positives. A collapse of the deal could raise oil prices. This would hasten the deployment & refinement of electric vehicles...something that would be great for society. 

And if you enjoy schadenfreude, high gas prices will drive Trumpkins batty.

2119 2018-05-06 18:26:14 Cannabis was the first agriculturally cultivated plant in human history. Jesus was anointed with cannabis oil. Use of the pejorative term “marijuana” to describe psychoactive cannabis is an indicator of ignorance.

2138 2018-05-06 18:23:06 “It’s says change oil soon, not change oil now”
2139 2018-05-06 18:22:42 Nowadays China has all necessary technologies to supply any drilling equipment necessary for onshore E&D. The main problem of Iran, Venezuella, Russia etc. is corruption in such gigantic amounts that it limits investment capabilities in further oil field developments.
2140 2018-05-06 18:22:37 If I turn my music up really loudly I can’t hear my car beeping for an oil change! Problem solved!
2141 2018-05-06 18:22:16 Anyway not to disrespect any form of art or the process which takes skill, but if I have to do one more fucking oil paint still life I’m gonna smash my head in with a hammer or like become an accountant or something
2142 2018-05-06 18:22:14 If this isn't the biggest waste of govt funds then I don't know what isn't...well I do but this is definately one of them...Let's have white oil, white tires, ...nevermind...GLOBALISM ISN'T REAL SO SHUT THE F@CK UP...being mindful of your shit and trash might be helpful.
2143 2018-05-06 18:22:08 EYEBROWS: 

-Apply vaseline to your eyebrows every night before you go to bed. The vaseline will make your eyebrows grow more 
-You could also use a mix of coconut oil, almond oil, and castor oil. It still does the same job as vaseline.
2144 2018-05-06 18:22:06 Not sure what the excitement could be - Saudi push for $80 oil will cause instability in the region with Putin/Iran, especially if Trump ends the Nuclear Deal. 

Mohammed is taking risks with a non-traditional approach at a critical point...

オリーブ油は、オリーブの果実から得られる植物油である。
2148 2018-05-06 18:21:13 Like why does it take so long for an oil change.
2149 2018-05-06 18:21:09 I've been doing keto lately myself.  No sugar, no complex carbs (try to avoid as many carbs in general), no trans fats.  But also try to get a decent amount of saturated fat found in meats, nuts, whole milk, avocado, Greek yoghurt, etc.  Replace butter with coconut/olive oil.

2154 2018-05-06 18:20:29 What a day!!! Finished furnishing the apartment obviously cleaned the whole thing, I'm dead exhausted.. but the boys came the fuck through with getting everything done now I'm lathered in coconut oil after a hot shower, getting a foot rub from my fave. Grateful
2155 2018-05-06 18:20:10 You need to go to a few oil fields. You need to be there when those welding hats come off. 
You might find you are wrong
You will see all races 
 I have welders in my family who worked oil field..pipe laying..welding you name it.. back breaking good paying.
 REAL MEN kind of jobs

2163 2018-05-06 18:19:15 Keeping constant pressure on Iran, is extremely important. The best “mythbuster” for their “Allah is clearing the way for Muslims to rule the world”, is defeat! 
The oil boom brought about a resurgence of this myth. Post oil is gonna get ugly over there!

2172 2018-05-06 18:18:21 Isn't it just a way for them to pump more oil, subverting quotes and capturing more market share? 
Seems like what we've seen every time OPEC has tried to limit production, right?

2175 2018-05-06 18:17:53 İran has an agenda coming through years and they have oil hence money, just like Russia. So the case of tr is slightly different than Iran. I believe rte will be forced to give up, somehow.
2176 2018-05-06 18:17:42 No offence to Brewdog (Punk isn’t even their best beer - Dead Pony Club is), but get onto that Beavertown stuff, especially Neck Oil 

Though tbf it’s @TopRopeBrewing who ought to be getting involved here.
2177 2018-05-06 18:17:41 2/Also, you don't understand the emissions cap (unlike the 4 oil sands producers that support it). The cap is not designed to cap production, but to allow production to rise while carbon-intensity falls, with the goal of keeping oil sands emissions at 70Mt/yr. Do your homework.
2178 2018-05-06 18:17:33 You smart!!! Like they say down here 'Oil de your head' 
2179 2018-05-06 18:17:22 What’s your fav oil? I’m tired of olive and I don’t like the taste of coconut oil. 
Do you swish for the whole 20mins?

2184 2018-05-06 18:17:03 @realDonaldTrump Please pull out of Iran listen to Israel to not supply weapons for the terroists,its like the drugs coming across the boarder. Find out if there intelegence has weight and intergity do other countries say the same. Deal on oil not weapons to demilitarise.

2186 2018-05-06 18:16:43 Trump is playing the Dick Cheney game, "We Take the Oil", & Trump said these very words himself. Trump must have watched the movie "W" & found out that Iran sits on 15% of the world's oil.
2187 2018-05-06 18:16:36 Okay, I'm tired of going into beauty supply stores and gotta talk to chun-li about coconut oil. The bitch don't understand me so I gotta repeat myself just so she can bring me to the wrong shit.
2188 2018-05-06 18:16:25 The ONLY thing he should be in trouble for is filming & sharing the film! This is my sticking point with female soldiers. Training is brutal; war is beyond brutal. If you can't handle training, you do not belong period! If you can't pull your share of the load, nope
2189 2018-05-06 18:16:00 1/Against new Alberta oil sands developments? You, sir, are indeed a liar. I have a large body of work that demonstrates just the opposite. I regularly appear on BC radio stations defending Alberta oil sands, pipelines and Alberta energy workers. I am a champion of the oil sands.
2190 2018-05-06 18:15:53 Wow DEA just made CBD oil illegal lmaoooooo welps-a-million
2191 2018-05-06 18:15:52 Plus the US has used the military to bomb factory suspected of chemical weapons but trump gave a warning to assar regime. So is it me or is the US working with dictator assad to profit off of the war for oil pipeline in Syria?

2197 2018-05-06 18:14:34 North Dakota has had its government gutted by oil and gas Republicans who are not so much interested in creating a livable state as a fast buck for themselves.

2199 2018-05-06 18:14:05 Lets All not forget the $240 a barrel call that Goldman made in July 2008 when OIL reached $140 or the selling of the so called AAA+ mortgage backed Securities to their own trusting clients when in fact secretly they were shorting them and failed to reveal that to their clients
2200 2018-05-06 18:14:03 We should put oil on the wall....lol
2201 2018-05-06 18:13:59 We were chatting about renewable sources and Xian relative, otherwise smart guy, maintains he’ll keep on burning coal and oil for his energy needs because “the good lord put them in the ground for us to use.”

2208 2018-05-06 18:13:10 I like to demonstrate the real expensiveness of oil compared to other commodities of necessity, average folks and financial experts have no idea how much is in a barrel, the mainstream wallstreet propaganda  is barking 24/7 it is impossible that oil will be expensive again.
2209 2018-05-06 18:13:09 I wouldn’t want him at my next oil change, never mind something important.

2213 2018-05-06 18:12:00 I'm still concerned about Nazi influence in our country. Fred Koch, father of the Koch Bros, built an oil refinery approved by Hitler. They have also been trying to change politics for 50 years and are GOP big money donors. I don't want to see an American version of Nazi Getmany!

2217 2018-05-06 18:11:39 1. The scandi model is still a market economy. It’s also worth noting that both Denmark and Sweden are struggling to retain talent and are reconsidering tax rates. Norway has oil. 

Rational self interest is perfectly reasonable. Socialism will kill the goose for 2 gold egg.

2219 2018-05-06 18:11:31 I know you can do it! If i had to recommend you a nice healthy dish i think you should totally try salmon (do without oil at the pan) and boiled brócoli!~ also if you want to add a little more you can put mashed potatoe on the plate is delicious easy fast and healty! Good luck

2233 2018-05-06 18:09:04 Sorry Bill.  Foreign investment in the oil & gas industry is leaving & fast. The foreign company I work for in Can lost millions last year & profiting in the other 50 countries they operate in.Why's That? Not cause the price of oil.Product can't get to market & heavy regulation.
2234 2018-05-06 18:08:59 Roaring laughing  my husband says I smell of chicken poop every day at the moment he runs past an old oil skin I have hanging in the Garage mighty stuff isn’t it 
2235 2018-05-06 18:08:47 No that is a true and fair statement made by many a president and national security experts. Just ask yourself was oil not involved in any foreign military interventions the USA has undertook
2236 2018-05-06 18:08:33 Absolutely transformed English football in many ways. Emirates should have made Arsenal perpetual contenders but they & Wenger were ambushed by the torrent of dirty/blood money of murderous gangsters/human-rights abusing oil sheikhs. Wrong that he suffered the bandwagon he did.
2237 2018-05-06 18:08:27 The player recruitment artists have painted some beautiful stuff the last couple of years..............they just need to dip their brush in the oil a bit bit fuckin’ more dude........
2238 2018-05-06 18:08:26 Better than a direct hit coffee-stain on the front cover. Soil on the spine and olive oil from a salad leak. All happened to me 
2239 2018-05-06 18:08:22 It’s corporate income tax on oil, gas companies and foreign banks.

2245 2018-05-06 18:07:47 Joe I love you but how can you remove yourself from the oil and gas industry? How do they make a profit without you voluntarily paying them so the world can have electricity? You can’t just pretend like resource extraction only benefits the few
2246 2018-05-06 18:07:46 A true end of a era. Man United vs Arsenal was a proper rivalry. No oil money. Both clubs worked with their own resources. Wenger & Sir Alex proper PL legends.

2251 2018-05-06 18:07:12 Right. So there is no corporate tax (except on oil companies for obvious reason). But the 55% appears to be an income tax for 5mio+ salaries, as opposed to corporate tax.

2256 2018-05-06 18:06:32 What kind a fear Russia generate among the people all over the world ?  its willing to withdraw oligarchs money from offshors? To turn off deliver of pipeline gas/oil to EU - No, so what the rest of world is afraid of in relation to Russia?
2257 2018-05-06 18:06:08 Your mom is my hero!! my husband just left the garage with an oil can

2260 2018-05-06 18:05:45 if you asked me to choose between olive oil and sesame oil i'd die. they're both nut worthy
2261 2018-05-06 18:05:42 I know this whole ~skincare~ thing is not for me because i keep getting deciem squalane oil in my eyes and for all the discomfort my skin looks exactly the same.
2262 2018-05-06 18:05:26 this tea tree & peppermint oil shampoo is life
2263 2018-05-06 18:05:22 You add oil before the unga not the other way round

2267 2018-05-06 18:05:07 It may be #NationalLemonadeDay but we're using lemons in a different way. Stop in a sample our lemon olive oil - it's one of our whole-fruit fused flavors.

2276 2018-05-06 18:02:54 We go to holding our own fate. We have not tapped our federal lands due to the boy king. We have more oil reserves than anyone. How about you liberals quit driving and using anything made from petroleum products if you want to make a dent.
2277 2018-05-06 18:02:50 someone hit me with some good beard oil?!
2278 2018-05-06 18:02:49 FF, I have some snake oil to sell you...

2282 2018-05-06 18:02:35 please talk abt something to the ppl of Karnataka. 
1. Why is diesel & petrol so expensive when international crude oil prices are half of what they used to be before 2014?
2. Instead of advising the youth to sell pakodas why don’t you focus on job creation.

2283 2018-05-06 18:02:18 Coconut milk, well shaken so thick cream layer is incorporated, is a great sub. You just have to like coconut! Blending silken tofu until smooth works as well. Almond milk is ok but doesn't have as much "heft" to replace creaminess. Can also blend 1/3 cup soy milk w/a neutral oil
2284 2018-05-06 18:02:10 Ran a solid 7th place at Lucas Oil Speedway last night! Really starting to trust the car more! We will keep pushing and keep moving forward. Can’t thank the Boss Factory Racing crew enough for all their help! Big thanks to @ripjetson9 @jankybobby @RacenJason93 and @SarffJayme
2285 2018-05-06 18:02:04 Soon, we'll begin to import those cars and oil will become obsolete. Back to square one!
2286 2018-05-06 18:01:57 Just FTR I do love olive oil.

2293 2018-05-06 18:01:42 What you mean like the Iraq war done for oil, because all the oil contracts were signed before any of the fighting started. Oh wait that was for democracy WMDs and capitalism.
2294 2018-05-06 18:01:36 oils ma!! i sleep w coconut oil and avocado oil in my hair and it helps!!
2295 2018-05-06 18:01:24 Me too. I thought it was the serpentine belt, but it's on. Oil is good. But idk and hope it's not the transmission. All I know is the truck jumped, then sounded like something was spinning, then it wouldn't go though I was on the accelerator. Hopefully it won't cost tons.
2296 2018-05-06 18:01:23 I think it’s primarily because they believed He was coming earlier in the night and thought they had enough oil to last until He did.
2297 2018-05-06 18:01:02 It's like saying "hey, even though he built a death ray and is holding the Earth hostage, you shouldn't speak ill of him. After all, he's a skilled engineer!" Yeah, he's a surgeon. He's also a fraud, a quack, a snake oil salesman, and responsible for harming people.

2309 2018-05-06 17:59:39 Israel is overly anxious to start a war. I wonder if Netanyahu having a horrible political year has anything to do with it? Throw in Saudi need to have ridiculously expensive oil that greedy investors salivate over and a fear to get labelled antisemite opposing it all, yep.
2310 2018-05-06 17:59:12 You said HSBC announced they wouldn't finance green field oil sands projects in Alberta anymore.  That they will finance brownfield sites is a distinction without enough difference 

Typical tactic of leftists is to label others as what they are doing.  Frankly it's unbecoming.
2311 2018-05-06 17:59:11 Roasties maybe? Prep as usual, wrap in foil and hot oil, place near not on coals?

2314 2018-05-06 17:59:04 ASSHOLE! Every time you tweet something stupid (which is EVERY TIME) you cause grief.  Now oil prices are going up because of you.  Your self-serving tax reform is benefiting only you and the 1%. You are a hateful inconsiderate moron with no morals whatsoever. You are despised!!!
2315 2018-05-06 17:58:49 Seeing a lot of bullish individual stock chart patterns, and liking the look of $IWM and $SPY, but many of the sector ETF charts still need some work. Oil/commodities, semis, software is where I'm focusing attention.
2316 2018-05-06 17:58:48 i will never use this oil again because it reminds me of old people smell, no offence but oh my fcking god THE WEIRD SMELL (moss+patchouli)
2317 2018-05-06 17:58:44 That's a fake post the liver can re-heal itself, that's a liver fried in oil.

2319 2018-05-06 17:58:34 Kuwaiti's r acting too big for their heels. Stupidity in annoying world's 3rd largest oil consumer.
2320 2018-05-06 17:58:28 What kind of oil? Thanks for the video:)
2321 2018-05-06 17:58:27 You say olive oil cures Alzheimer’s and I follow you to the end of the Earth calling you a jerk until the day the sun goes out. This rule is not negotiable.
2322 2018-05-06 17:58:25 Yeah.  Wires, clearinghouse, etc

Goal is to have a monetary  system outside the domain of a political entity.

His “problems” occur when at port, docked, so his dream is some sort of “oil derick” style permanent platform “city” where the “entity” is ALWAYS within Int waters.

2325 2018-05-06 17:58:17 The conspiracy of ravens was a nice fiction. Although, it provides what happens in reality to oil sales in the country...#conspiracyofravens
2326 2018-05-06 17:58:14 they come from a long line of stupid. they probably bought snake oil in the 1800s. common sense, science, facts be damned.
2327 2018-05-06 17:58:08 yeah, a lot of the walls look like they were done with watercolor, the finer details like the furniture may have been done in ink, and the way some of it smears, maybe even oil pastel, but the fine straight lines outlining the room and door i would assume to be done in ink (1/2)
2328 2018-05-06 17:58:03 .* i wanna go to b ham right quick but the way the audi set up it need a oil change ima gone get one tomorrow
2329 2018-05-06 17:57:59 Again, you’re trying to spread misinformation! I already provided you the complete link to the correct numbers, not a pull quote from who knows where. Ask the experts on the Pro Oil side, they’ll tell you it’s a 7 times increase and that’s a projection before it’s even built.
2330 2018-05-06 17:57:52 It's sad that @itsa_talia feels the need to call out Musk for this (who is actually helping the world with electric cars etc), instead of calling out billionaire oil barrons or the Waltons or Bezos, who take advantage of the poor and use their wealth to destroy the world.
2331 2018-05-06 17:57:51 It’s says oil life 15%
2332 2018-05-06 17:57:46 The right doesn't care about veterans. They only like the low-paid "troops" that defend their oil and shoot at brown people
2333 2018-05-06 17:57:45 Health care premiums skyrocketed after ACA was passed. Higher gas prices are ok with me as my husband works in the oil fields. You must not want what’s good for your fellow countrymen because we are much better off under Trump administration.
2334 2018-05-06 17:57:45 Draft dodger for war.  Just like loser #Dubya. What happened when the US allows a draft dodger who works for big oil, munitions, and neocons.

2336 2018-05-06 17:57:36 To make a painting like this it would take months cause it’s oil. But I’m totally down for the challenge 
2337 2018-05-06 17:57:22 Ie Saudi Arabian oil tankers
2338 2018-05-06 17:57:21 lo has an essential oil
2339 2018-05-06 17:57:20 So United’s fans are ‘Glory hunters’ even though we’ve been sub par (for us) since Fergie left. Yeah makes sense.  Where did City’s fans suddenly come from? Hardly heard a peep until Arab Oil poured fortunes into the club.
2340 2018-05-06 17:57:16 It was roughly 1969, El Segundo, CA at the Rod and Gun Club, Chevron Oil's Trap Shooting facility. My Uncle Albert Alexander invited me and my cousins to sign up to take the NRA Safe Hunter's Course. Our instructor, was Jimmy R. Lions.

2342 2018-05-06 17:57:07 What James chooses to listen to are journalists and organizations funded by arms contractors, oil companies, and plutocrats, with a history of not being held to account.
2343 2018-05-06 17:57:03 Agreed. We should pull out and leave them to their ways. 

Let them live without our intervention. If we want their oil that badly, we could negotiate?
2344 2018-05-06 17:56:43 Haha serious im laughing laughing at you guys. Feel free to ask for guidance
2345 2018-05-06 17:55:55 Coffee with butter and coconut oil is actually delicious and successfully replaced breakfast this morning with no hunger pains. Nice

2351 2018-05-06 17:55:30 Bless him. I mean, he had the turning circle of an oil tanker, but he loved Arsenal and the fans.
2352 2018-05-06 17:55:24 Global oil demand may peak, as climate policies and technologies like electric vehicles advance, but it won’t be because we run out of oil @JasonBordoff
2353 2018-05-06 17:55:14 Tell Erica to get some organic coconut oil and rub some on while tanning and even after. It will help soak the color in and not dry you out. And to start off with only an hour of sun each layout session.

2360 2018-05-06 17:53:26 The extent of Trump's stupidity is one for the ages.  We won't be goaded into a war with Iran to save Israel which doesn't need saving or for Iran's oil to profit the oil companies.  Corporate America Foreign Policy
2361 2018-05-06 17:53:23 These guys have their heads buried in (oil) sands
2362 2018-05-06 17:53:12 We don't know about that specific location, but there are definitely oil rigs dotting a lot of the area off the LA coast.
2363 2018-05-06 17:52:57 often times, our greatest strengths lie in that which we naturally exceed at and naturally struggle in, simultaneously
2364 2018-05-06 17:52:50 Industry is split between the Energy Dinosaurs like Kenney, who refuse to admit the global energy system/energy politics are changing, and the Energy Progressives, which include the 4 big oil sands producers who supported the Climate Leadership Plan.

2368 2018-05-06 17:52:31 Oil!
2369 2018-05-06 17:52:26 2 lies in one post. Amazing. 
Israel does not accept oil from Turkey. 
Israel does not support Daesh, but it may prefer its terror over Iran's terror

Falls directly on face 
Puts skateboard away for a few more years
2371 2018-05-06 17:51:42 Sounds almost Trumpian. Like only he has the answer to complex problems. The “snake oil” pitch is always a big seller with the politically naive. Little Kenney has delusions of grandeur that make no sense.
2372 2018-05-06 17:51:41 If y’all need an oil change jiffy lube on culebra is fucking great. Massage chair and friendly ass dudes.

2376 2018-05-06 17:51:18 I am working in Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Aramco) as a Quality  Control Inspector and i know the complications of engineering thats why i am saying engineering is a complicated thing to do but talking is very easy you can do it all the day but do it for good.
2377 2018-05-06 17:50:58 If u saw a snake, then it is witches, please come and buy this oil. I sell it 70 cedis but ur issue requires immediate attention so bring 4 cedis for 1.
2378 2018-05-06 17:50:38 Apply a mixture of Amla oil, coconut oil, and castor oil and the results will amaze you! This is my go-to treatment when needed.
2379 2018-05-06 17:50:35 War with Iran would send oil prices much higher — a big plus for Russia.
2380 2018-05-06 17:50:28 also gotta get an oil change  i hate waitin
2381 2018-05-06 17:50:20 Calgary mainly office jobs, warehouses and health. But other cities in Alberta have oil so engineering is good there

2392 2018-05-06 17:49:02 How do environmental groups (you know, the ones fighting to protect our land, air, and water) feel about Zinke? How do coastal states feel about oil drilling off their shores? You know, the places that bring tourist dollars to their economy.

2398 2018-05-06 17:48:17 , semi covered in oil and soot from his failed attempt to attempt to fix an electric car Bulma gave him a while back. "Coming to check over Goten's homework?"
2399 2018-05-06 17:48:14 So, you're asking that government tell diverse oil companies how to operate their businesses?
2400 2018-05-06 17:48:08 Put tea tree oil
2401 2018-05-06 17:47:57 make sure that all your skincare products are 100% fragrance and alcohol free because those are the #1 things that aggravate the skin. i also would highly recommend starting away from anything aggressive like witch hazel or tea tree oil

2403 2018-05-06 17:47:26 There is 70 soccer fields is not much oil obviously no value for one of the 7 large oil Corp but for mine that's a push of 50000 barrels more per day that will be 430000 barrels  of Brut sale everyday starting 2019 we are small but it is okay we meet our target... remember 
2404 2018-05-06 17:47:19 There was always a point towards the end of the holiday when the St Tropez factor 2 oil came out.  May as well have just coated yourself in Crisp n’ Dry.

2406 2018-05-06 17:47:11 Tras el PEAK OIL si traducimos el EXCEDENTE a la energía necesaria para producirlo ¿Se podría decir que el excedente si o si disminuirá? ¿Y que pasará con las OPRESIONES bajo una disminución de este? #veo_nubarrones
2407 2018-05-06 17:46:39 I would recommend trying salicylic acid first before jumping to accutane. Depending on how bad your acne is, you can also try differin gel. It’s adapalene 0.1% and works really well for acne and excess oil.

2409 2018-05-06 17:46:25 Can anyone figure which fast-food meal(s) could contain palm oil as an ingredient? Why would a big American fast-food cooperation be buying so much of it yearly?
2410 2018-05-06 17:46:24 Just a fact you should already know. 23 indictments has come out of the Muller investigation.  And the 2 years spent on Hillary's e-mails; 0.  If Muller's investigation is dry, I wish I had an oil well as dry. I'd have more money than Trump!
2411 2018-05-06 17:45:49 AMERICA is so broken... our government spends trillions chasing oil control for #Saudi & #Israel & resources in other countries (they, the gov/military likes to call it "#TERRORISM or #WeaponsOfMassDestruction #War) when America is crumbling...roads,cities, schools, mental health
2412 2018-05-06 17:45:46 tried cbd oil yesterday and made it 24 hours without a xanax. 1st time in 3 years. v proud of myself.

2414 2018-05-06 17:45:38 I usually shop at the one on Broadway in Lakeview, but it's also happened at both ones on Ashland (Wicker Park and Lincoln Park West)! That's the crazy thing! I went back the one time when I was overcharged $18 - lunchmeat scanned twice AND olive oil scanned twice...
2415 2018-05-06 17:45:36 We are a clinic that helps people get their med marijuana card. We don't say we supply weed. You can buy flower for vaporizing at most dispensaries. The oil in the dispensaries that you vape or use in drops contains THC and CBD derived from marijuana, not hemp.

2420 2018-05-06 17:45:09 My car is at 150k and she still runs like a beaut. I’ve got a Hyundai. Mileage doesn’t necessarily equate to care! Def still ask about oil changes and transmission issues, but that price is a steal.
2421 2018-05-06 17:45:03 Consistency may be the oil, but variety is the spice of living. Don’t limit your options by subscribing too literally to the idea that you must be consistent. The rules should be steady; the consequences of violating them can vary.
2422 2018-05-06 17:44:49 See?  You made my point @BartlettFred.  Nice!
2423 2018-05-06 17:44:49 Night #1 Challenge Series results @ Ogilvie Speedway: Started on the pole in the heat and broke oil pump belt DNF.

Feature started 22nd finished 12th.
2424 2018-05-06 17:44:48 No need to go heavy. Hit all of the bearing surfaces. I use oil that doesn't migrate so it stays cleaner when I carry. I've ruined a few shirts in the past with oil.
2425 2018-05-06 17:44:43 It’s inaccurate to call yourselves “Oil Sands.”
2426 2018-05-06 17:44:30 Israel had no issues with shipping stolen Syrian oil from Turkey back to Israel though, did it? And Israel has no issues with arming Daesh, in fact even stated they would rather see Daesh in Syria than Iran. Odd statement from a country that “fights” terrorism.
2427 2018-05-06 17:44:26 Mike if you take Oil Heritage Rd to Lakeshore Rd, there is a conservation area there(can't remember name). They have a boat launch way in the woods. Would be a great area looking over lake for viewing Aurora. Should be next to 0 light pollution there.
2428 2018-05-06 17:44:04 How often does your car need oil changes ha cause i swear I feel like I just took it in 
2429 2018-05-06 17:44:03 After apparently being responsible for the premature deaths of about 6 Briggs powered gas mowers, I’ve now bought my first battery powered. If this works well, I look forward to never having to fukn worry about oil/gas/filters/carburetors again. Review to follow.
2430 2018-05-06 17:44:02 Just one more part to buy to fix the oil leak and a new tyre, then hopefully no more money will have to be spent on it for a while
2431 2018-05-06 17:43:59 I heard Moroccan oil is pretty good too!

2436 2018-05-06 17:43:37 Oil companies are to blame
2437 2018-05-06 17:43:27 The left and the right, are like two pistons in a v-twin. When one is up, the other is down. Let’s be glad that it’s running so badly. Everyone that’s in the know about these motors, knows they run best right before they throw a rod! Checked the oil? Oh yeah, we’re the oil!
2438 2018-05-06 17:43:26 If one chooses to believe, then one is either very gullible and naive; ignorant, or pre loaded as a Jew hater. It’s really that simple.
2439 2018-05-06 17:43:25 Time for an oil change... oooh, lordy! ＼(＾O＾)／
2440 2018-05-06 17:43:21 My grandma just gave me a few household items to help me save money grocery shopping... she gave me olive oil from JANUARY 1999. Bless her soul but I can spare the 7 bucks.
2441 2018-05-06 17:43:16 Hey, ever heard of cooking oil? It's made from plant and you can even eat it, mental right? 
Meanwhile, It's still slippery. 
A marvelous thing really.
2442 2018-05-06 17:43:13 Israel can use some more oil.
2443 2018-05-06 17:42:56 Great, but what about eating a salad dressed with just a little bit vinegar, olive oil and seasoning (salt, pepper, herbs). It's healthier and vegan as well.
2444 2018-05-06 17:42:51 くっっっっそ眠くて錯乱している
2445 2018-05-06 17:42:48 What about olive oil ? !!
2446 2018-05-06 17:42:33 Flipping heck, bio oil is a miracle oil. In three weeks, small scar on my nose that had been there for months has gone (not a sponsored tweet) 
2447 2018-05-06 17:42:27 It’s not economically feasible to do oil by rail
2448 2018-05-06 17:42:26 Wicked Nigerian Northerners. They can fool everybody or blind them with Biafran oil money, but rhey can't fool the smartest President alive. Stupid North whom Obama helped to rig the 2015 nigerian election with overwhelming evidence. Shameless people.
2449 2018-05-06 17:42:24 getting burned by an oil splash while frying something.
2450 2018-05-06 17:42:22 It’s not ALL ABOUT OIL!
2451 2018-05-06 17:42:09 I'll bet Kellyanne has a medicine cabinet full of snake oil.
2452 2018-05-06 17:41:59 Before the Dino’s died and oil was even invented
2453 2018-05-06 17:41:51 Could you get them tinted and keep using castor oil? But check out rrayme on ig she has wonderful beauty tips and has lash extensions.
2454 2018-05-06 17:41:32 holy crap!!  that's crazy ... they should wash, wax and change your oil too

2457 2018-05-06 17:41:04 And the thing is, there is a fiscal rationale 4 the gas tax as much as we may not like it. Ca. Drivers can pay up to $1800 dollars for auto repair bc of bad roads. Not to mention, gas prices are set by oil companies and OPEC.

neutral v ambiguous

neutral is a bullseye while ambiguous can be centered on neural yet still be interpreted as one side or another
2460 2018-05-06 17:40:33 Olive oil was also recommended.   We fried.

2463 2018-05-06 17:40:18 Didn’t know what oil pulling was before reading this and now I want to try it. Thank you.
2464 2018-05-06 17:40:17 Work asked me how much I wanted to pay for my oil change... I said $0, and they didn’t find me amusing

2466 2018-05-06 17:40:12 Venezuela has enough oil, metals mines, and arable land to give every country the middle finger and survive for 1,000+ years. They brought this cautionary tale on themselves.
2467 2018-05-06 17:40:09 Lotus engines notoriously leaked oil.
2468 2018-05-06 17:40:07 You may be right McConnell received 8.5 million donations from Russian oil to fund GOP Super Pacs. NY. AG. has him and others in the GOP under investigation for violating the RICO ACT money laundering.
2469 2018-05-06 17:40:02 Me too.  I read recently that Putin has been shipping oil and stuff to NK against UN sanctions for years.  Some kind of partnership there.  Putin is a snake, and a smart one.  Trump is a snake, but not smart at all.  He’s being played by putin.
2470 2018-05-06 17:40:00 The annointing oil was mined and transported in 42 meter road trains
2471 2018-05-06 17:39:58 Looks great Squire! Glad it went well! Octopus, oil and herbs is similar to a dish I had in Japan which is still one of my favourite dishes ever. Simplicity is so underrated! 
2472 2018-05-06 17:39:57 Changed the oil, flushed the transmission, and serviced the fuel injection. Driving my car right now almost feels as good as sex.

Almost.
2473 2018-05-06 17:39:49 @SunnyAnderson dumb question. I am learning to cook and am having difficulty in choice of oils. When is olive oil appropriate and canola vs vegetable oil and lastly which is ok to pair with butter
2474 2018-05-06 17:39:48 Who need brakes or oil changes done today I’m free!!
2475 2018-05-06 17:39:45 Coconut oil got my legs shining

2479 2018-05-06 17:39:26 Why are @dominos employees in Briton Ferry cleaning out their cooking oil into the storm drains ate the rear of their shop? Very naughty indeed
2480 2018-05-06 17:39:11 I used to use baby oil . BABY OIL! ME! FRECKLES MULDOON!
2481 2018-05-06 17:39:06 Nice too see some parts of North America not using Middle Eastern oil.
2482 2018-05-06 17:39:00 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.

2483 2018-05-06 17:38:55 The most #heart healthy #Oil for high heat heat #cooking is #Thrive #algae oil. Has a neutral taste; doesn’t get denatured by high heat. For dressings and low heat cooking  I use extra virgin #olive oil! Eat well, live well!
2484 2018-05-06 17:38:45 All electronic items prices fall subsequently, talk about petrol why sold at record high prices?
When oil prices are @ 1/3 rates?
2485 2018-05-06 17:38:37 Stop lying. There are no greenfield projects that will be built at current prices, therefore not lending on greenfield is a complete red herring. HSBC told me they will lend to production with declining carbon-intensity, which is what oil sands CEOs have committed to.
2486 2018-05-06 17:38:30 It’s say clearly there you could barely know how to turn a ratchet and do an oil change
2487 2018-05-06 17:38:21 Castor oil plant?
2488 2018-05-06 17:38:16 This shows how un-America and sick Republican/tea party is.  They only want to take care the oil and rich and the 30% White in the country.
2489 2018-05-06 17:38:13 Does a recipe that involves mushrooms, chicken, olive oil, salt, and butter have...
2490 2018-05-06 17:37:50 Obama didn’t start ish with the country that has control of the oil either 
2491 2018-05-06 17:37:47 man vs jammed shredder, WD40, olive oil, cable tie and finally got the screwdriver out.
2492 2018-05-06 17:37:45 Nope the only guilty one is trump. And you fell for a snake oil salesmen.
2493 2018-05-06 17:37:41 Tha would be the equivalent of me saying every liberal I talked to blamed Bush not Obama. I would agree the war had an impact on oil prices. However, that has nothing to do with Trump. 

And no, what you need is actual evidence of this claim. I haven’t seen any yet.
2494 2018-05-06 17:37:39 This morning I cooked fake bacon in olive oil.

2497 2018-05-06 17:37:25 Headline should read, "girl removed from Army." And the story should be different...

2500 2018-05-06 17:37:10 Gonna get a drain & fill for my transmission fluid, and an oil change.

2504 2018-05-06 17:36:30 We should all stop playing the game. They didn't 'overlook' anything. As long as I've lived these thieves and liers have sold off, closed down and destroyed. Easy money. And their oil and gas friends are doing very well, thanks.
2505 2018-05-06 17:36:22 I love running errands. I hate when someone says they are busy because they have to run errands. Like I want to come. You’re going grocery shopping? You’re getting the oil in your car changed? Going to the dentist? Count me in, baby.

2511 2018-05-06 17:35:17 Exactly how about getting Oil is from Middlesbrough I hear he has his team's playing fast expansive football. But more realistically let's steal Garry Monk from Birmingham and give money to rebuild with.
2512 2018-05-06 17:35:09 Just eat salmon for breakfast. Fish oil is one of the most stupid supplements you could take.
2513 2018-05-06 17:34:56 also it’s not even close to what russia really is... far from it, it’s medieval mad max reality ruled by kgb oil, drug, weapon and slave smugglers, producing hate on an industrial scale
2514 2018-05-06 17:34:51 Absolutely. You can see the thread throughout the book, NOI did all she could not to call her out directly, perhaps due to her illness. GEJ let her run amok and tarnished his legacy, he could have done more if he dealt well with the oil shortfall issues and NNPC nonsense.

2519 2018-05-06 17:34:09 Yes. That's what I meant. We used call the shop where we used to get it the oil shop. Old fashioned name. They do give quite a good light.

2521 2018-05-06 17:33:58 Could have prolonged the war, no doubt. Germany´s oil capacity would still have been an issue from 1943 onwards.

2528 2018-05-06 17:32:58 All marijuana is legal in WA now, even recreational. I haven't yet tried just CBD oil, I think now that that's a thing that's available I may try it. I tried all kinds of pot stuff years ago when I got my "green" card, but I didn't tolerate the smell AT ALL. Barrrrf.

2531 2018-05-06 17:32:11 where's the focus on Quality Assurance transparency tracking, to know what you are purchasing seed to flower/herb/oil and how it became potent value . .  .  ?! 3rd. party certified purity
2532 2018-05-06 17:32:10 Your original point was mince as is your follow up. Iscotland would do 2 things at least, run its own monetary policy and make sure that oil companies paid taxes on a par with Norway. That’s just for starters
2533 2018-05-06 17:32:10 y'all probably already know how castor oil on your lashes help them grow like that shit is science level true it rlly fkn works but here's a fun tip: instead if using a q-tip dap it on ur lash like eyeshadow for faster results

2536 2018-05-06 17:31:57 There is always another way to see it, David. POV depends on where you stand. John will die and be replaced by another AZ R, just not when you want.
2537 2018-05-06 17:31:39 An additional thing in developing countries is the huge dependency on a single industry like the oil&gas one, which doesn't really generate a significant amount of jobs despite of its huge profitability.
2538 2018-05-06 17:31:38 You’re not from Vancouver are you? When have you seen Ferries sailing through the Burrard Inlet? When have you seen any Seabus cross either of the 2 Narrows? How many barrels of Bitumen are on board each vessel or all these vessels vs an Oil Tanker with 659 000 barrels of Bitumen
2539 2018-05-06 17:31:32 Love idiots who constantly disparage successful business owners and CEOs as money grubbing robber barrens getting surprised those same people don’t just write personal checks each time there’s a tax increase.

2544 2018-05-06 17:31:08 Stop apologizing for HSBC.  

You bring up a distinction that does not make a difference.  HSBC says they won't finance green field oil sands projects.  Alberta should boycott them.
2545 2018-05-06 17:31:04 they also oil things. 
2546 2018-05-06 17:31:03 790 is the actual cost of production / distribution ...what a stupid question.... where does it go??? Money goes to the oil company...(dhakkan)

2573 2018-05-06 17:27:46 One of the big issues is replanting to produce more palm oil as one of the biggest veg oils used. It’s replacing natural habitats in sensitive areas by rogue sellers. Agree though that it’s demonised, soy for example takes more land and isn’t as good an oil.
2574 2018-05-06 17:27:22 A bit of Hawaiian Tropic oil factor 4 is the way forward.
2575 2018-05-06 17:27:11 Oil & coal are history & the old dinosaurs in office now that are trying to hold on to it and get every penny of profit from it before they die should be voted out immediately.

2582 2018-05-06 17:26:15 pure argan oil!! Not that fake shit if it’s not a deep yellow or orange and doesn’t smell nutty it’s mixed with other things so don’t put it on your face!

2600 2018-05-06 17:23:35 Of course I do. And many have proven renewable alternatives. I know we'll never do away with oil/gas completely but we could realistically cut our consumption by nearly half with virtually no impavt on our daily lives.
2601 2018-05-06 17:23:22 We disagree on the reasons for his remaining in office. It's OK to disagree.

2605 2018-05-06 17:22:24 Didn't you mean long oil? Loved the Market Breaking Points video
2606 2018-05-06 17:22:23 Should have used cooking oil.
2607 2018-05-06 17:22:17 I was on a flight once that had to go back to the airport about 10 minutes after take off due to, if I remember correctly, an oil pressure problem in one of the engines.

2622 2018-05-06 17:20:46 Yes - enough olive oil to "loosen up" the mix and as much garlic as you would like [as you will be eating the garlic raw. Then I just blend it all up in my tiny food processor. Sometimes I add cherry tomatoes or anchovies if I have them.
2623 2018-05-06 17:20:46 Hate to admit it but putting factor 10 tanning oil on today wasn’t the best decision I’ve ever made
2624 2018-05-06 17:20:32 Haha actually I’d recommend trimming it every two months or so. Coconut oil is your best friend and stay away from heat as much as possible.

2629 2018-05-06 17:20:05 Well, its mostly known for growth and also for retaining moisture which ,if I'm not wrong,is good for all hair types. Try mixing yours with castor oil to make it more easier to use because sis is thicc.But for the most part its a natural oil so much easier absorption.

2674 2018-05-06 17:15:25 It's amazing the government can bring supermarkets to account for fixing the price of bread by a penny or two yet oil companies can collude on the price of gas to change the price of a fill by dollars #gas #cndpoli

2676 2018-05-06 17:15:22 Depending on where you live you could try cbd oil, I’ve seen multiple people use it for their pets, to not only help with seizures but tremors too. I’ve never personally tried it, so read into it, to see if it could help your situation.

2679 2018-05-06 17:15:05 Two not super nice things from this morning, the first is that I ruined a pair of pants with olive oil from my lunch salad. It's not like a speck, it's a blob. It didn't come out in the wash.
2680 2018-05-06 17:14:42 It's the machine that strips old lane oil and applies new oil. It's the model. The engineers make everything on it hard to reach so even light maintenance requires pulling apart significant sections. That has meant very little preventive maintenance has been done.

2697 2018-05-06 17:12:06 I get it I work in the oil industry across the world where people earn more than £30k a week … but we have to put the effort in to earn it!! However when we win big maybe we also have the same attitude … so I get it. Doesn’t stop me being disappointed

2809 2018-05-06 16:57:52 It’s noon and we’re already almost done taking cars for the day... people are seriously leaving their cars for 3-5 hours, and some of them for OIL CHANGES. It’s nice outside, why not just go home and change your own oil??
2810 2018-05-06 16:57:47 Never seen roads and streets in worst conditions then now. What about 200K oil&gas jobless contractors? CT run off from Alberta  most of the drilling companies.
2811 2018-05-06 16:57:43 What we can agree on is that the current list (from the 2nd link) is from the 1% and fortune 500's, #oligarchy, (Big oil, auto) that, like the #kochbrothers, want lower taxes, #free #trade, the off shore of american jobs, lower wages, lower workers rights, more corporation rights

This use-case is solid, easy to understand and adds significant value to every business that normally uses B/L (e.g. oil&gas industry). I would advice to contact the industry directly,they are looking for ways to save funds

2828 2018-05-06 16:54:55 Your credibility is gone. Claiming natural gas and oil production is unsubsidized is nonsense. I'm done discussing this with you - you are clearly just in this to make the quick buck without thinking about full implications, or even bothering to educate yourself. Adieu.

2861 2018-05-06 16:51:05 If he were to use it for medicinal purposes, there are numerous ways other than smoking it to do so. Most likely through CBD oil or edibles that contain little to no THC. THC gets one high not the CBD. A lot of misinformed people on here.

2865 2018-05-06 16:50:32 I’ve always called them Jojos cause that’s what the menu said! Never looked into the history till just now... looks like they started out in Oregon being breaded, seasoned and fried in the same oil as the fried chicken.

2871 2018-05-06 16:49:38 Don't let ze Germans see this.  They'll start getting ideas.
2872 2018-05-06 16:49:38 Iran’s oil sector will mirror Venezuela’s if they sell to China at discounted prices. Will be fine for two years but then the lack of capex will bring production down. Iran needs to get on board in the Middle East or be left behind.

2881 2018-05-06 16:48:51 I would be in favor of abandoning it and putting our money into something that is sustainable AND produced effectively. Oil companies have to love being able to dilute gasoline by up to 10%, as it means customers have to fill up more often.

2912 2018-05-06 16:44:36 Try organics olive oil. Items range from 1k, quite reasonable. There's also a local brand "el glittas,  hair wonder". Their shampoo is both shampoo and conditioner all in one and its 800, use Shea butter as hair cream then use Lipton tea for tea rinse incase of breakage. Simple.

During the rainy season there was an unmistakable smell of oil rubbed into the teak.

The Oriental in Bangkok, at least the old wing with the Authors Lounge, should be on the list. Maugham, Greene, Conrad.

2933 2018-05-06 16:41:57 I started taking cold-pressed flax seed oil, which is a cost effective treatment that helps with mood swings and is great for your skin and hair. It's high in omega 3's. You can also take salmon oil which is a blend of omega 3, 6, and 9.
2934 2018-05-06 16:41:56 You know that’s funny as fuck and you know that you don’t need no Proffessional to do no oil change
2935 2018-05-06 16:41:41 You are right... we should be refining oil in Alberta, but that’s now 10 yrs too late... but that has nothing to do with Canada’s exports.

2955 2018-05-06 16:39:37 Hot oil has gotten on my glasses...!
2956 2018-05-06 16:39:22 I am capitalism and my anatomy is the anatomy of a monster, I breathe fire, I consume oil, I tinker with your pretty brains.

2959 2018-05-06 16:39:11 He is 87. Dementia is setting in, no way to learn new things as his brains plasticity is close to 100%.. in a time where we find alternative to oil and technology develops in a very fast pace. Why would we listen to this man???
2960 2018-05-06 16:38:57 Kenny campaign slogan: “Our Government wants to get into the business of marketing for business...well, just oil business”.
2961 2018-05-06 16:38:38 Iran won't be able to survive the major assaults. Russia will keep it's distance. Collapse of Iran will destablize the world. If a million civilians died in Iraq and Afghanistan. There will be at least 10 times  during conflict with Iran. Control of oil will again spill blood.
2962 2018-05-06 16:38:37 Bio oil, sold at Walgreens :)

2965 2018-05-06 16:37:51 Will he go after foreign funding of oil sands supporting industries like Fraser Institute, his own Canadian Taxpayers Association, the Manning Centre and maybe hit Texas based Kinder Morgan for dikking around with Canadian politicians?  Silly boy.
2966 2018-05-06 16:37:49 the more you sweat in peace the less you bleed in war.  You have GOT to weed out the weaklings.

2973 2018-05-06 16:37:01 Govt oil companies @HPCL, @BPCLimited & @IndianOilcl are dishonest as the Govt itself. Their staff is trained to sell premium petrol by telling lies that rates have gone up. On 1 hand @narendramodi is looting citizens with excise & on other these cos loot with unethical practices
2974 2018-05-06 16:36:43 There will be lots of Bloodshed in Elections... this atmosphere is being made... and people like you are adding oil to fire...

2987 2018-05-06 16:35:26 Try wild hair growth oil the yellow bottle is a light oil and it softened up my hair because I have very thick hair
2988 2018-05-06 16:35:09 It’s funny that i was just debating whether to put coconut oil in my hair or not and then i saw this tweet
2989 2018-05-06 16:34:53 I didn’t say fracking was good for the environment. Oil isn’t only produced via fracking anyway...

2997 2018-05-06 16:34:08 How to deal with crippling social anxiety, other than using CBD oil.
2998 2018-05-06 16:33:36 I remember this all the way back to the OPEC oil crisis days of the 70's. It's always a different excuse bu the same people are blamed. Islamophobia, along with ignorance, has been around for a long time.
2999 2018-05-06 16:33:21 Also I saw one spider and have been sprinkling tea tree oil on all things
3000 2018-05-06 16:33:17 how do they not know about NFA and title II GFA? should... should we tell them, or...?

3002 2018-05-06 16:33:01 I read Mark Taylor's book "Trump Prophesies" from public library, his interview update on YT. Taylor has been making spot-on predictions: Trump to be #Potus, USA = #1 Oil producer. Only issue: timing of big-name Cabal arrest is too soon #qanon #MAGA #moab #WWG1WGA #GreatAwakening
3003 2018-05-06 16:32:56 導体球の鏡像法はアポロニウスの円などの幾何的性質を利用したりガウスの法則から表面電化密度を求めたりそれを面積分したりといろいろ楽しいので好きです

3009 2018-05-06 16:32:21 #breakingnews: Coast Guard monitoring potential diesel oil spill in La Push, today. Fishing vessel Shilaily began taking on water w/bilge pumps running while moored at pier. Reportedly 100 gallons of diesel fuel on board. Boom and absorbent pads have been placed around area.
3010 2018-05-06 16:32:15 Found a leak of "Oil of Every Pearl's Un-Insides" on Soulseek. Disappointing first impressions, but still well worth a listen.
3011 2018-05-06 16:32:13 ขอบคุณมากๆค่ะพี่ออย
3012 2018-05-06 16:32:02 Gotcha, so it's more of a case of wanting guys to use careful targeting and control procedures rather than just breaking out a weapon on full auto, spraying the entire area without hitting the target?

3016 2018-05-06 16:31:41 Not that I know of. Vegetables oils are always added for texture etc. There's cases of palm oil mixed into coconut oil in India and Pakistan but those were illegal mixes.
3017 2018-05-06 16:31:40 1kg sirloin of beef, on the bone. Marinated in olive oil infused with garlic, wild garlic, chives, sorel, parsley and rosemary. Cooked on BBQ. Om nom nom #food

3020 2018-05-06 16:31:08 Internal combustion Engine Companies get far greater subsidies. GM was bailed out. VW was caught cheating in Germany and will now be bailed out by german tax money. Also negative externalities can't be ignored. Also all the subsidies that lead to cheaper oil.

3023 2018-05-06 16:30:43 Yeah, and to continue to rely on foreign nations for oil since they do contribute to the DNC funds
3024 2018-05-06 16:30:42 Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:

- James 5:14
3025 2018-05-06 16:30:34 Damn girl, you're burning the midnight oil here!
3026 2018-05-06 16:30:33 Sigh. I've asked scientists about this point. Oil sands is the correct term. Tar is a man-made product and not the technically correct way to describe bitumen. The fact it is was called the tar sands decades ago is irrelevant. Scientists say it's oil sands, so it's oil sands.

3030 2018-05-06 16:30:11 Capitalism says absolutely nothing about how you use the money you earn. That said, he IS using his money to fight climate change, so why attack him? Why not take issue with the Koch brothers or oil magnates? I really don't get the hate for this guy.
3031 2018-05-06 16:30:06 私は牛乳飲んでない
3032 2018-05-06 16:30:00 New alternator, two new batteries, and 15 quarts of oil... rip me and rip my bank account
3033 2018-05-06 16:29:59 you did oil show?
3034 2018-05-06 16:29:58 Ya, but they just want to find “reasonable middle ground!”  Hahahahahahahahahahahaha. THERE IS NO FUCKING MIDDLE GROUND!  Thus the wording “shall not be infringed.”
3035 2018-05-06 16:29:52 This is poor stewardship of our public and private property. @MargMcCuaigBoyd  Redwater decision puts the public purse at risk. No word on lake districts idea by AER being useful. @suncorenergy Troubling best in the world oversight/reg. Our kids, grandkids stuck with bills of oil
3036 2018-05-06 16:29:51 Boil potatoes and stir well, add onion, ginger, green chill&chop them, add mustard oil, mustard seeds then add chopped onions, ginger, garlic, and cook for 1 minute.roasted potatoes and then add roasted salt in it according to the taste and till brown, your potato CHOKHA is ready
3037 2018-05-06 16:29:45 I've used vegetable oil on poles. Have to redo every time it rains. It washes off with the rain so I'm sure it washes off squirrels paws and any incidental contact with birds as well.
3038 2018-05-06 16:29:36 should be smoking weed then lmao or at least vaping CBD oil
3039 2018-05-06 16:29:34 The Shell Oil Company originally began as a novelty shop in London that sold seashells.

3048 2018-05-06 16:28:43 Iran Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said Iran supports “reasonable” oil prices and does not advocate high oil prices.
“We strongly believe that oil market should be kept away from politics. Politics will disrupt the process of oil industry development and free market of oil.”

3050 2018-05-06 16:28:26 But the issue at hand was nexus between dollar being dropped as key driver for war. E.O.D , I always oil as being primary driver for countries such as Iraq , Libya and Iran - with other factors/ motivations coming into view.
3051 2018-05-06 16:28:12 
3052 2018-05-06 16:28:12 Never just use oil to moisturize your hair ,  it can’t penetrate your hair shaft and cuticles.  Use a water based moisturizer then you use oil to seal in the moisturizer. Hence it’s a sealant.

3060 2018-05-06 16:27:39 One last tip: it can be hard to determine what skin type you have. Really dry skin overcompensates and produces a lot of oil as a result so it’s hard to tell. It’s best to just start off with a simple routine and get to know your skin and work new products in as you learn.
3061 2018-05-06 16:27:34 Too damn funny. Those little rodents are damn smart too. He'll keep up trying to go up until he clears the pole of slippery oil...he'll get his bird seed before he's done 
3062 2018-05-06 16:27:28 Because any oil that the bird will come into contact with in that scenario is significantly less than a drop. And I ask for evidence because it’s easy to make unbanked claims.

3068 2018-05-06 16:26:32 That's right. Imagine no longer handing over 100% of our oil and gas revenues to get back less than 10%. That'll really hurt the Scottish economy.

3073 2018-05-06 16:26:20 what a benefit to putin bibi assad Saudi's etc to all get their rid of iran & trump to get that oil he's been waiting on for so long. Not to be shared with American's just for him to bilk American taxpayers some more.
3074 2018-05-06 16:26:13 You say that like it's a choice...
I have noone else to turn to,
And once my brain has had enough, it will kill me.
It's like running a car without changing the oil. One day, that engine is going to overheat and throw a rod.

3082 2018-05-06 16:25:30 Unfortunately I have now had the evidence that Trudeau =Harper =Notley in terms of subsidizing the oil and gas industry. Nothing wrong with this. What is wrong is pretending to us before we elect y'all that you will not do this stuff. @OilGasCanada Best to tell us y'all malleable

3089 2018-05-06 16:25:02 The higher national interest is simple: the Palestinians will blame the Israelis for being unable to deliver necessary supplies. Pictures of deprived people, suitably made to look miserable, will be circulated with captions indicating that their pain is Israel's fault.

3096 2018-05-06 16:23:58 Refinement to that great point; let’s at least cut or reduce oil/gas products that are a wasteful inefficient use of oil. Single use plastics, and ICE vehicles. We still need oil to build smart & meaningful products.
3097 2018-05-06 16:23:54 Hahaha! That’s amazing. Most people twist their face in a knot when they hear about goose liver. The burger also had this slice of truffle oil infused Brie. It was a VERY decadent hamburger.

3100 2018-05-06 16:23:41 Coconut oil is for hair not skin. It’s so thick that it clogs your pores and causes acne
3101 2018-05-06 16:23:37 Pure olive oil. Milly served
me that cutlet with a sprig of parsley. Take one Spanish onion. God made
food, the devil the cooks. Devilled crab.

—Wife well?

—Quite well, thanks...
3102 2018-05-06 16:23:35 It might be entertaining, but it’s a disaster if oil gets on any bird feathers. Think Exxon and you’ll understand.
3103 2018-05-06 16:23:18 While I wait on my oil change,  why not go to the movies! #IFeelPretty
3104 2018-05-06 16:23:11 Mate - you're too ignorant for this debate. "All the oil profits" are included in this graph (well a geographic share of them).
3105 2018-05-06 16:23:10 Just pick up a feather and look at the structure, it’s clearly going to be f’ed up by even a scant drop of oil. I don’t know why you needed to ask for scientific research in  the first place 
3106 2018-05-06 16:23:10 لا هنا النظرة حلوة .. خققتني 
3107 2018-05-06 16:23:03 Also, na maybe ni preference but liquid oil, akina Rinsun would be better. And after you knead, you need to let the dough stand covered by a moist wash cloth for at least an hour ndio it "cooks" sort of...
3108 2018-05-06 16:23:02 Not enough oil in the kneading process . 

You can add oil before beating it into submission then add after

Alternatively add oil when you roll, make it into a ball and roll again before putting on pan
3109 2018-05-06 16:22:57 I heard peppermint oil can get rid of spiders. I'd now like to announce I live in a peppermint world. Literally everything smells like peppermint from the bag of chips I just bought, to the toilet paper.

3116 2018-05-06 16:21:38 @VillaCappelli can chime in here, but you can fry up just about anything in high quality olive oil. I just wouldn’t deep fry in it. @VinnieTortorich and i will bring this up on our next podcast.

3124 2018-05-06 16:21:14 You should! But remember oil is a sealant not a moisturizer. So don’t use it alone

With the oil that was in contention many were compromised. Agreements were signed. He may never be tried. But he’s definitely a war crimes suspect. #AsabaMassacre was under his command as was #BiafraBlockade & #RedCrossAttacks among many other war crimes!

3157 2018-05-06 16:17:12 Will give it a shot, though the olive oil I have right now (from Southern France) will likely have a stronger taste than the ultra-processed and bland seed oils.

3175 2018-05-06 16:15:37 Still only accounts for 1/1000th of the auto sector. Growth is high but still a long way from making a difference to global oil demand. Even by 2030 you will have 200m evs and 1.8b internal combustion engines. Stay long oil.
3176 2018-05-06 16:15:35 Previous PC government failed big time to get enough returns on the non-renewable resources. No one talks about the Tapcal Trust Fund donors. Were these donors big oil companies? What did they get in return for their donations? PCs anti-democratic from the Lougheed error on.

3178 2018-05-06 16:15:28 Incidentally, it’s another reason I advocate keeping a small number of US forces in eastern #Syria. 1) it allows the US to improve its diplomatic and political leverage; and 2) instead of a Trumpian “we’ll take the oil,” we’ll deny that axis access to it & impose further costs.

3186 2018-05-06 16:14:10 In 2015, it cost ~$50-$90 to produce a barrel of oil in Alberta; oil was selling at ~$40/barrel. In 2016, oil was selling at ~$50/barrel. In 2017, ~$55/barrel. The only reason Alberta oil is profitable again is because Cenovus and Suncor innovated and automated.

3211 2018-05-06 16:11:31 Vegetable oil on the pole won’t harm the birds, or prevent them flying. I think you’re confusing it with crude oil and oil spills, which does terrible damage to them.
3212 2018-05-06 16:11:20 The  same reasons y pple  want opinions from anybody that has controversy around them! Sometimes the squeaky wheel gets its oil & other times the wheels just break! It’s the lubricant or lack thereof that matters! Churchill was a squeaky wheel w/out a lubricant until he wasn’t!
3213 2018-05-06 16:11:17 MPL oil is the goat.  Don’t let all these fancy hair products fool you.
3214 2018-05-06 16:11:09 Oil was the foundation that would pave the way for investment in renewable energy. If you take 30 dollars off per barrel drawn out the North Sea that’s a hell of a lot of money up in smoke.
3215 2018-05-06 16:10:58 And not to forget too electric battery will replace oil fuel sooner or later.  I know tax is one major income and Gst is good but i think tax on people with stagnant income is not good source of income

3219 2018-05-06 16:10:28 My point is that in the scenario of greasing up a vertical pole in order to keep birds from perching on it, there is Let a feasible way for a bird to get enough oil on themselves to put them at risk for what your study is focusing on.
3220 2018-05-06 16:10:18 you only target AB. BC and Quebec dump raw sewage and other crap directly into the ocean. Hydro destroys land. There are other pipelines everywhere. Enviro laws here are the best in the world in Canada but Quebec & other provs buy oil from anywhere without any concern how it came
3221 2018-05-06 16:10:14 Try bio oil!!
3222 2018-05-06 16:10:13 Fossil fuel production is based on demand - it will cease when demand ceases. If you have a problem with oil & gas, then by all means cut all products from the industry out of your life.
3223 2018-05-06 16:10:09 odds favour @jkenney to win next AB exln. But there's a chance he could lose what was a slam-dunky opportunity. One note johnny themes of oil & Alberta victimhood may fill UCP rooms, but leave a lot of room for competitors to describe a more interesting future.

3228 2018-05-06 16:09:44 What kind of oil are you using? I've cut store bought/regular mayo because of the seed oils (I blame @TuckerGoodrich !). I might start doing some myself (though shelf life seems pretty short) but am wondering what oil to go to.

3242 2018-05-06 16:08:36 Saddam showing the world that a country could abandon the dollar & significantly prosper-very bad precedent. So , imo - in the context of stated wmd reason vs dollar dumping and wanting to control Iraqi oil , one can a make the argue March 2003 war was about the dollar and oil.2

3251 2018-05-06 16:07:28 @RonWyden-What can be done to stop Zinke now or to get him removed from office? Oil&gas is one thing, but he just directed FWS to ignore the Endangered Species Act, wants grizzly bears shot in Montana, eagles/other wildlife are sick/dying from lead ammo/fishing tackle,...ENOUGH!!
3252 2018-05-06 16:07:25 I take your point that it seems odd but oil is oil, and there’s interference with the ability to move air whether it’s corn oil or petroleum. Oil spills carry other risks of toxicity; I think the risk here is increased (unnatural) vulnerability to predators.
3253 2018-05-06 16:07:18 oh lol idk you was serious lol just buy the oil I got you
3254 2018-05-06 16:06:58 It be .... errrr... a youthful touch of arthritis. Also taking joint supplement and CBD oil to help.
3255 2018-05-06 16:06:55 I’m not loving it. It tastes a little  odd. This is the first time buying store bought mayo since abandoning Hellman’s due to its soy bean oil. I’ve made better mayo myself.
3256 2018-05-06 16:06:22 I've tried 3-in-1 motor oil, Vaseline, and WD-40. The squirrels here in north Florida are not fazed by such measures. Didn't even slow 'em down.
3257 2018-05-06 16:06:13 Oil was never the foundation, it was a bonus.

3264 2018-05-06 16:05:19 Now you can tie this in with more govt jobs, etc and yeah, that doesn’t make for good business sense. But to ignore the white elephant that is the historic stupidity when it came to a investing primarily in oil..

3269 2018-05-06 16:04:43 Your not kidding ! He is a 100.000 mile engine with no oil in it with a 100 miles to go that how screwed he is :)))
3270 2018-05-06 16:04:33 Oil G is that guy
3271 2018-05-06 16:04:15 I miss oil pulling. Gotta get back into it. What brand do you use?
3272 2018-05-06 16:04:10 I tried that but it ultimately failed...oil gets wiped off.
.what dies work is putting a slinky on the pole...check it out on youtube
3273 2018-05-06 16:03:57 After that, you chop more onion and tomato, cilantro, mint up. Sautee cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaf, fennel, and black cardamom in oil for about a minute, add in the vegetables and the mint and cilantro, add the chicken and sear. Then add rice, water, pressure cook for 10m
3274 2018-05-06 16:03:31 I think the major concern is the emissions from burning exported oil, rather than pipeline spills
3275 2018-05-06 16:03:17 Petrol in 2014 was Rs 70/litre when global oil prices were $150/barrel, today global oil prices are Rs69/barrel and Petrol is touching Rs 80 plus in most places in India. Good governance I guess

3279 2018-05-06 16:03:06 the same will go for oil & fracking. It's about asset stripping Scotland. They are already doing it by trying to call Scottish goods British, When Westminster says British it means English & more specifically it means the tory heartland in England.
3280 2018-05-06 16:02:55 For many years, oil money flowed freely. You had to work hard, but not smart.
Now Alberta is upset that it has to work smart. Instead of changing, Alberta wants to push the clock back.

3318 2018-05-06 15:58:50 My mother used to bathe me  ... well wash me off wid olive oil and water when I had bad flare-ups
3319 2018-05-06 15:58:50 I’m not saying what the NDP have or haven’t done. I’m saying historically, Alberta has invested mostly into oil.. it’s not a surprise to anyone with half a brain cell that oil prices fall, lack of ability to get to market, etc. Means no more money for Alberta’s main income source

We hope that you will find these suggestions helpful.
3325 2018-05-06 15:58:12 So let me get this straight...while the NDP is fighting for the oil pipeline,Kenney wants to eliminate abortions and make creationism be just as valid as evolution. Careful, people: Kenney wants to make Alberta into the 51st state.
3326 2018-05-06 15:58:03 Oil pastels and colored pencil are probably the two that give me the most trouble and that I’m the most displeased with when I incorporate them.

1st, oil was in recession started under the PC's. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to pull up a chart of historical oil prices and then overlay that with AB employment.

2nd, gas prices are up ALL OVER THE WORLD! Has fk all to do w/NDP

3381 2018-05-04 23:56:05 It’s made out of nuts and oil,,,, which still aren’t produce
3382 2018-05-04 23:55:51 It is perfectly reasonable to criticize the way that the West approached development with a lack of care for the world but no matter how much coal is burned or oil drilled the end goal will not be reached that way. It will destroy the earth. The West shares culpability here.
3383 2018-05-04 23:55:50 Much easier to say that instead of “the oil money dried up and I can’t buy my seats anymore”
3384 2018-05-04 23:55:31 im finally gonna start oil painting, never done it before but a bitch is excited
3385 2018-05-04 23:54:41 We've added new Pureness Matifying Compact Oil Free Foundation SPF15 (Case + Refill) - # 20 Light Beige at our store. Check it out here:
3386 2018-05-04 23:54:41 I'm good with it if you guys dump all your oil based products and live free. I sure hope take it to heart.

3388 2018-05-04 23:54:12 I haven’t found one yet. Makeup removers always irritate my skin in some way  I use baby shampoo to take off my eye makeup/lipstick & then an oil cleanser for my face.
3389 2018-05-04 23:54:04 The same national park service hes trying to destroy by digging for oil?
3390 2018-05-04 23:54:02 Hi fish oil lover 

Haaa untuk ni sis tak ambik order banyak first come first served
3391 2018-05-04 23:53:52 I’m screaming loco running away from the popping oil how me of him
3392 2018-05-04 23:53:32 Coconut oil swish it around and boom you’ll be in good
3393 2018-05-04 23:53:30 So dint was as high or higher 800,000 years ago, who was to blame back then?  No power plants or oil companies, right?
3394 2018-05-04 23:53:12 You know more than just Alberta has oil right?
3395 2018-05-04 23:52:57 @_____BW We get you there! Have you taken care of the oil change?
3396 2018-05-04 23:52:47 The USA wont be happy because he wants to dig & mine their own oil. The USA will probably invade Mexico after Iran.
3397 2018-05-04 23:52:47 Maybe oil and gas.
3398 2018-05-04 23:52:47 Not if it's that jackass.
3399 2018-05-04 23:52:27 Those were called idiot lights, so I put real gauge's in my car when I was an teenager, It showed the exact oil pressure, water tempt, My 400 small block usually reached 180 deg.
3400 2018-05-04 23:52:24 Hilarious Americans. Your Christian lobby is so powerful that your evangelicals wield power equal to the gun lovers and the Oil tycoons. What a deeply fucked up system of government you have. All aboard the crazy train 
3401 2018-05-04 23:52:17 Let's not forget that there are 4% less rigs at work in Alberta now in comparison to last year. Price of oil is higher and less rigs pumping. I wonder why 
3402 2018-05-04 23:52:13 "A Malone distinctive: we equip you to go into the world with your horn filed with oil. Be filled with the Spirit of God. Go change the world." Dr. Soza #baccalaureate #graduation126 #malonelife
3403 2018-05-04 23:51:58 I use Josie Maran light argan oil before I put on primer in the morning and tarte maracuja oil at night.
3404 2018-05-04 23:51:40 You know there is more than oil in the energy sector right?
3405 2018-05-04 23:51:30 You could sell CBD hemp oil online They pay weekly. I take it for my anxiety. Message me if you want more info.
3406 2018-05-04 23:51:13 Without polluting Oil and Coal companies the whole world could be beautiful like this #FightClimateChange 
3407 2018-05-04 23:51:00 About to. They've gone up .30 a gallon in 6 weeks here in Oregon. Hasn't been this high in a long time. Are we looking at over $4 now? What's the excuse for this. His oil buddy's can make more money?
3408 2018-05-04 23:50:52 ブーム的には収束方向かしらん(´(･)｀)
3409 2018-05-04 23:50:43 Then they can add to it housing for immigrants from Yemen, and illegals from Honduras.
3410 2018-05-04 23:50:16 You would be surprised how many devices have outdated battery tech.

Tbh batteries are already 20 years behind where they should be thanks to the oil industry.
3411 2018-05-04 23:49:47 you are a prime example that a mind is a terrible thing to waste.
3412 2018-05-04 23:49:42 @Laucapon recently read an article about how supposedly horrible coconut oil is for skin. I have had much better skin since using it AND I don't have to spend an arm and a leg for over priced beauty products. Peele find something bad with everything
3413 2018-05-04 23:49:27 What percent of the states budget is dependent on tribal dollars? Oil and gas companies wouldn't stand for their voice not being heard. We must hold them accountable for bad votes #nativevote
3414 2018-05-04 23:49:22 石油だってオリーブオイルだって変わらぬオイルだ。だからみんな、資源は大切に使おう。
3415 2018-05-04 23:49:21 Coconut oil the only edge control a nigga would need lol
3416 2018-05-04 23:49:09 What about jobs in the oil sector ? Oh right, that’s in western Canada and you hate western Canada.  Are Toyota cars burning fossil fuels???
3417 2018-05-04 23:49:06 Great question. Hahaha oil makes your skin shiny so it attracts more sun lol #science
3418 2018-05-04 23:49:04 there is actually a difference . Brent oil vs crude oil per barrel .Kuwait Petroleum Bina @ChouhanShivraj
MP project 

as of today, Brent Oil/Crude Oil  pricing is hovering around 74 and 69  US $ resp.

300 is very overpriced. there should be all sorts of revolutions in that case
3419 2018-05-04 23:48:45 Get a grip, Suzuki wants to shut down oil and gas, not for climate reasons, otherwise he’d be riding a dam bicycle and talking by postal... no oil, no phones, computers etc etc.let’s buy oil from 3rd world countries that shoot people for no reason and behead In front of kids.....
3420 2018-05-04 23:48:30 I’m doing oil, edibles, tinctures, creams. Some strains make my heart race. My body is in shock. I guess I’m dying, not by suicide, by govt regulations.
3421 2018-05-04 23:48:18 white supremacy is when the white dregs of society get together and tell themselves they are better then everyone else not white.
3422 2018-05-04 23:48:11 Is the ketchup money running low? Need the oil money now? Lol
3423 2018-05-04 23:47:49 I just use coconut oil for everything lol. My edges naturally "laid" no it's just the coconut oil give it some shine. I never understood edge control tho that shit really work?
3424 2018-05-04 23:47:41 I wanna see Trevor and Reggie box it out!!!! Shirtless with hot oil on their bodies. #DearWhitePeople
3425 2018-05-04 23:47:37 Somebody is asking about the best clean energy solution to power oil and gas rigs and I'm not sure how the hell I should feel.
3426 2018-05-04 23:47:37 Pissed my momma told her bf I smoke  now he ask me everyday do I want oil or 
3427 2018-05-04 23:47:32 Turning oil into wine.
3428 2018-05-04 23:47:19 They do have choices, they can easily build gas and oil power plants. They can sit down and negotiate. Not having a working nuclear reactor is not going to stop life in Iran or bankrupt it. Having one though could lead to that outcome.
3429 2018-05-04 23:47:13 Coconut oil setauku dari santan, Coconut oil bisa dibikin sendiri kok nder tapi kudu sabar
3430 2018-05-04 23:47:06 In the 70s we used to slather ourselves in baby oil and iodine to sunbathe. Googling this shows that iodine might have been protective; the baby oil not so much :)
3431 2018-05-04 23:46:57 I need to change my oil and vamos gaskets now that you mention it
3432 2018-05-04 23:46:55 terus kok itu coconut oil-nya gak cair? iya, soalnya coconut oil ada yg bentuk solid sama cair. itu yang di gambar bentuknya solid:-)
3433 2018-05-04 23:46:53 At Confermation today got sick of the oil on my head so I wiped it off to find out a second later we we're shaking hands with those around us... You can see how that would go...
3434 2018-05-04 23:46:46 I bought new tires, windshield wipers, got my oil changed, washed my car & vacuumed it out today :))))
3435 2018-05-04 23:46:26 I have seen the data... it's a pretty clear trajectory, both CO2 and general warming trend. As far as promoters.. again, there is a scientific consensus. 90% of scientists. It'd be easier to look at the detractors, who are usually paid for by big oil.
3436 2018-05-04 23:46:16 Hot oil hit me in the eyeball and I walked it off don’t ever tell me women are weak
3437 2018-05-04 23:45:41 Es que le suspendieron la cuenta corriente el Oil...
3438 2018-05-04 23:44:06 coconut oil itu minyak yg diekstrak dari kelapa, bisa pake fermentasi atau pemanasan.
kalau brown sugar setau aku itu gula putih biasa dari tebu tapi ditambahin molasses (ekstrak kental).
3439 2018-05-04 23:43:52 “You’re wetting my shirt, but it’s okay. Do you cry oil?” Dean teased reassuringly, rubbing the small of her back.

She likes big blokes, body oil, sex that chokes
3442 2018-05-04 23:43:35 Coco butter, shea butter, coconut oil & vitamin E oil. I mixed them together & all my stretch marks went away.
3443 2018-05-04 23:43:14 塩はいいよな。いつもﾌｧｻｰっとされて。
3444 2018-05-04 23:43:07 Polls are flawed all the time. Go take that vote in areas of oil workers for example, or affluent neighbourhoods .....wow overwhelming for...reverse that you’ll probably lose. So?
3445 2018-05-04 23:43:07 To plump up lips, apply peppermint oil.
3446 2018-05-04 23:43:06 Brown sugar setau ku gula merah... Tapi memang ada juga gula yg sudah seperti gula pasir warna nya brown(?)

Untuk coconut oil, ku tak tau :c mianhae
3447 2018-05-04 23:42:50 Yerp, just throw some oil in a pan let it heat up after grating the potatoes and padding dry the shreds so they fry nicely 8o
3448 2018-05-04 23:42:45 @elonmusk just go with it you are just awesome  there is no car/oil company want to solve the global warming issue. It is tesla who made it
3449 2018-05-04 23:42:37 Did an oil change on my car for the first time today and it was seriously so easy that now I'm mad that I ever paid to have someone do it for me all these years
3450 2018-05-04 23:42:32 Drinking oil and Incredible Hulk... Oh no lol
3451 2018-05-04 23:42:27 Maybe it's because I live in the Republican South & Bible Belt that it occurs here more often than more liberal parts of the USA
3452 2018-05-04 23:42:22 Gets to a point of the night where my make up feels like actual frying oil from a chip shop on my face GET IT OFF NOW
3453 2018-05-04 23:41:58 Oil has given us a tremendous comparative advantage and enabled our economic and social development. However, the future is not going to be a repetition of the past.  With the development and rise of new technologies, the comparative advantage of oil won’t be as strong as before.
3454 2018-05-04 23:41:48 Coconut oil just cured my scrotal oedema. #FACT #Pioppi
3455 2018-05-04 23:41:47 raw olive oil is kinky

3460 2018-05-04 23:41:21 that's what the olive oil, bread crumbs, cheese, and seasoning are for! hahaha.
3461 2018-05-04 23:41:18 Maybe because his tongue game is like @DandoisCindy striking game.
3462 2018-05-04 23:41:06 Ahhhh im all shaved up and dipped in cocunut oil... ready to be ate tf up like the last pink starburst

3469 2018-05-04 23:39:45 My neo gave me 2 gallons of QUE Oil to take home after the probate yesterday. He obviously wants me dead. Got me riding around with evil in the backseat. I feel like the Devil’s Uber driver.
3470 2018-05-04 23:39:23 Driving home from Denver and am seeing many new oil drills, burn offs and pumps. It is a welcome sight after the past couple years. #wyoming
3471 2018-05-04 23:39:22 Fela is not just a motivational speaker. He's a business consultant. He has consulted for several telecom industries and trains executives in big oil firms

3475 2018-05-04 23:38:53 The cabbage thing worked the best for me. Also drinking mint tea, hot compresses and mixing lavender oil w/ coconut oil and applying it to sore areas 
3476 2018-05-04 23:38:29 This should be taken into account even when we relook at what should go to Turkana % under the oil discovery. Serikali ni moja tu na Nchi ni moja. Only sober debates required.
3477 2018-05-04 23:38:26 One snake oil salesman to another...
3478 2018-05-04 23:38:21 Oil oil here and there.
3479 2018-05-04 23:38:20 I think ima order pizza for the kids and spend that hour of cooking taking care of my hair instead. I'm thinking.. Hair mask, oil treatment, diffuser and doing that thing where you separate and form each curl. In the name of self care you feel me?
3480 2018-05-04 23:38:14 Mixing oil and water
3481 2018-05-04 23:38:10 Are you sure there's no cheese in the crust? Also, oil is no bueno for your health...
3482 2018-05-04 23:37:57 snake oil salesmen are surprisingly supportive of each other.
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
3483 2018-05-04 23:37:18 You are correct. Oil and the religious lobbies, who usually agree with each other.
3484 2018-05-04 23:37:11 Save ends/stems of veggies, scraps of meat (skin, bones small pc of meat) in a bag in the freezer. Once you have a substantial amount, roast in the oven with some oil and simmer in water. Boom nutrient rich broth outta literal trash
3485 2018-05-04 23:37:10 My first time having Omega oil 
3486 2018-05-04 23:36:54 Making my mom a pain relief aromatherapy oil for mother's day. Knee and back pain have been kind of strong. No worries mama, pain relief is on the way. #MothersDay 
3487 2018-05-04 23:36:42 Then the oil shoots him?
3488 2018-05-04 23:36:35 Oil money?
3489 2018-05-04 23:36:26 Hypertrophic scarring is whack
Emu oil is really helping with scarring & speeding up the healing process on my Philtrum.
3490 2018-05-04 23:36:19 Tbh, I love god and shiz. He is my homie, but why the fuck do we have to push Christian ideals in schools? It's the same reason why we can't even discuss evolution in school, it makes no sense to me. This occured to me when talking my APLANG test and I had to know biblical -
3491 2018-05-04 23:36:18 I wanna pour oil on your fucking face
3492 2018-05-04 23:35:42 I just realize I need a man who knows about cars, or can at least do an oil change; cuz I’m tired of having to pay for one.
3493 2018-05-04 23:35:35 Oz is a snake oil salesman
3494 2018-05-04 23:35:12 I need somebody to take my car to get a oil change tomorrow while I’m doing community service 
3495 2018-05-04 23:35:08 I don't know where you've been these last 20 years, but if there's any "fluff" it's in private schools peopled by the wealthy. Think of education like a car that's never had it's oil changed. Pefect anaology for US Education. We're getting what we paid for.
3496 2018-05-04 23:35:01 Frying food in vegetable oil still makes it somewhat healthy.. right ?
3497 2018-05-04 23:34:53 Interesting(>ω<)I think so too.
his hear,clothes and all over were covered with salad oil…
3498 2018-05-04 23:34:44 I’m not disrespecting them I’m disrespecting the stupid congress and former president that sent those ppl to fight wars in Libya Iraq you yourself know that there wasn’t to WMD yet people kids die. For what? OIL!
3499 2018-05-04 23:34:33 He has twice suggested that he wants lower gas prices. How he plans to effect that, I have no idea. There has been talk of slashing the mandated oil reserves by half, partly to raise some money, but also the Americans are now net exporters.
3500 2018-05-04 23:34:33 there's only one person that can do it,but he will need to come out of retirement,but I think even for him the Job will be too big ,I think that's why he retired ,He probably knew that things are just going to become more difficult without investment I.e better managers,oil money
3501 2018-05-04 23:34:31 It's hugely arrogant to think you know science better than 90% of world scientists. You can accept scientific consensus at face value. 

I'm not sure what to take from your oil production remarks.
3502 2018-05-04 23:34:29 What about oil submersion!? What's more exciting than buying expensive equipment and dumping mineral oil all over it.
3503 2018-05-04 23:34:11 I would have loved to see if you used it with their oil and a brush, that worked for Jackie Aina. Did they have a tutorial video for this product? I feel like that is a must with such a specific application for a foundation.
3504 2018-05-04 23:34:10 He hasn't been proven wrong yet (that Capitalism is bad and will end). Remember, he lived and died before the age of cheap oil, which is what has enabled C to last this long (whilst it has accelerated the process that's going to render the planet largely unfit for humanity).
3505 2018-05-04 23:34:07 One would almost think thier corporate office was in an oil state!
3506 2018-05-04 23:34:06 Break the engine in properly before beating the shit outve it. When you put new rings and bearings in you’ll get metal shavings either way just try and flush most of it out with numerous oil changes.
3507 2018-05-04 23:34:05 Does anyone have a vaporizer pro and want cbd oil for it? I bought it and it doesn't fit my dab pen and I can't return it 
3508 2018-05-04 23:33:55 人かよ、地名かと思ったわ
3509 2018-05-04 23:33:45 I need a oil pen cartridge 
3510 2018-05-04 23:33:38 So are y’all just going to ignore the fact that there is a whole bunch of dirty oil being thrown on the ground and it’s going to end up in the ocean and our drinking water ? @peta y’all wanna jump in or...?
3511 2018-05-04 23:33:22 Im already mad today and just reading thid... uhh... I HATE PEOPLLLEEEEE
3512 2018-05-04 23:33:13 @Febreze_Fresh or @glade should make a scent for men... coffee is fine, but if they want my $$$$ give me gun oil scent. Ladies used to dab vanilla behind their ears, give me a lady that smells of gun oil and I’m in love   
3513 2018-05-04 23:32:48 IMO most aren’t understanding the game they’re playing: 
Step 1 = Swap USDs for control of real assets.  
Step 2 = begin to price/settle those real assets’ production in CNY instead of USD.  

It’s this 2nd step that may have set off alarms in the aftermath of the CNY oil rollout
3514 2018-05-04 23:32:44 I wonder when Chip last changed the oil in his hair?

3521 2018-05-04 23:31:09 What do you expect from governor who is owned by the same oil companies that murdered indians rather than pay royalties. The same Governor who pushed Pruitt into the EPA. #embarrassment
3522 2018-05-04 23:31:06 @PaulMancano has zero credibility and might as well go to Fox News and report how Trump is eloquent, compassionate and competent.  What kind of snake oil/used car salesman poor attempt at comedy is this?!  8-23 FFS you unthinkable, uninformed dimwit.  They could be >.500 in AA
3523 2018-05-04 23:31:00 Hmmm maybe we’re not taking care of them because we’re fighting endless wars over oil?
3524 2018-05-04 23:30:49 Brian I find that 300 mg of high quality fish oil and 60 mg of Pravastatin have work wonders for my mental acuity. Perhaps still help with #RudysSenility  I'm older than Rudy I can say this
3525 2018-05-04 23:30:01 CCI Canadian Crude Index close for May 4th $51.11 US/bbl +$1.03 +2.47% #CCI #CanadianCrudeOil #CDNCRUDE #Oil #CCXETF $USO $DBO $OIL $UCCO
3526 2018-05-04 23:29:15 So who cares? Maybe McLean’s should cover the crazy antics of our mr dressup PM as he runs up our debt and crushes our oil industry investment with his leftwing antics. That would b newsworthy in Canada!
3527 2018-05-04 23:29:11 $NOG oil @ almost $70 believe nog is way behind the $ curb. Sure offering was a left field grounder, but  bought cheap assets. ER pop-ready
3528 2018-05-04 23:29:09 The opposite of "excel," no?
3529 2018-05-04 23:28:34 It's always the same question: what problem are you solving? And is it oxygen, aspirin, or vitamins (or cod liver oil...). Block chain or old school, always the same.
3530 2018-05-04 23:28:18 No! Especially that one! 
3531 2018-05-04 23:28:16 The Gold Cup isn't a worthy tournament anymore. There needs to be a tourney for all the America's. Now Copa America is a farce after oil money buys you a spot.
3532 2018-05-04 23:28:01 Agreed!  He speaks as though everyone is afraid of the NRA, except for him, but then turns around & backs their policies (including trophy hunting).  With that said, how can we expect someone who thinks bringing back oil & rolling back protections can be a forward thinker?
3533 2018-05-04 23:27:49 They say coconut oil fixes everything.

*side-eyes manuscript*
3534 2018-05-04 23:27:25 Coconut oil melted bruh. It’s summer outchea.
3535 2018-05-04 23:27:22 Noooooooooo NIGGA I said the same thing, the oil ain’t no joke.....it took me 3 mutha phuckin days to NOT be high after 1 small ass dose

3539 2018-05-04 23:26:29 Lol  of course. When are people going to learn he’s a snake oil salesman who says/ sells whatever the people who happen to be around him at the moment want to hear. The real problem in America is why do so many people want to buy what he’s selling.
3540 2018-05-04 23:26:28 Be sure to follow @Walkapedia_  or along on the @RaceMonitor app this weekend for full results from Valley and Lucas Oil!
3541 2018-05-04 23:26:21 This is all about oil and gas exploration.  Please, at least be truthful about it.
3542 2018-05-04 23:26:08 My car icy clean, fresh oil change, replaced the splash shield... where we going????

3544 2018-05-04 23:25:43 The whole issue with palm oil is related to orangutans. Yes that is terrible, but all oil production results in habitat loss, so the fixation with orangutans seems speciesist.
3545 2018-05-04 23:24:31 I can’t breathe 
3546 2018-05-04 23:24:26 Relax Olive oil. Nobody is ever going to apologize to wolf .
3547 2018-05-04 23:24:22 Untrue.
Fake News.
A couple of his businesses have.
Not DT personally.
Now Google how many time Standard Oil of NJ has gone BK.
That's the Rockerfeller clan.
It's a business tool that folks are given the right to use.

Not a doomsday happening at all.

Sears has done it a few too

3549 2018-05-04 23:24:21 Today I went to Ross to get coconut oil... I ended up walking out with three outfits, a pair of shoes, a set of pillows, and no coconut oil 
3550 2018-05-04 23:24:10 Maybe he could've ripped it if he didnt have his jerkoff gloves on probably some leftover oil on them
3551 2018-05-04 23:23:20 China’s purchases of real assets all over the world (as those real assets are priced at 100-yr lows relative to financial assets) suggests they see those as safe assets.  I’d much rather own an oil field, chemical plant or farm for the next 20 yrs than USTs given US entitlements
3552 2018-05-04 23:23:08 Looks like an oil seed rape field to me. But each to their own x
3553 2018-05-04 23:22:52 Olive oil - properly prepared (hence pure olive oil should always be used) - is one of the most effective agents for stimulating muscular activity, or mucus-membrane activity, that may be applied to a body.
3554 2018-05-04 23:22:46 But how you going to put wet meat in oil sis? That is sounding like looking to burn up the house.
3555 2018-05-04 23:22:41 The 5000 hours of chopped I've watched has taught me that truffle oil is always a bad idea
3556 2018-05-04 23:22:38 What a joke. Go ask prosperity gospel snake oil salesman Joel Osteen for receipts. I'll wait. Stop operating in bad faith.
3557 2018-05-04 23:22:37 I don't own a beard, but I really want to own the beard oil! It looks awesome!
3558 2018-05-04 23:22:30 IF U HAVENT GONE THRO A GREENDAY PHASE IN UR LIFE, are u even reAl???!!!!
3559 2018-05-04 23:22:28 Salmon rules!!! I eat it at least once every two weeks. I put olive oil on it, then blackened seasoning, then a squeeze of lemon after I take the fish out of the broiler.
3560 2018-05-04 23:22:27 I can't think of a better way to make me withdraw my kid.
3561 2018-05-04 23:22:09 What about tea tree oil?

3565 2018-05-04 23:20:33 Wait, are they covering up People’s Park… cuz the homeless guys used it as a needle dispensary when I was there.

3573 2018-05-04 23:18:52 trying to think of more photoshoot concepts/stylings.

after seeing @aquariaofficial's oil slick Mermaid fantasy last night I REALLY wanna recreate that too. 
3574 2018-05-04 23:18:50 I used to use it till it found it too much work to wipe all the oil away. I use it in a pinch now, but prefer micellar water!
3575 2018-05-04 23:18:45 Nah lol
3576 2018-05-04 23:18:35 Most logical way to move the oil now. Win-Win-Win for the Prairie Provinces
3577 2018-05-04 23:18:14 Sorry, there’s misunderstanding dear,, I meant 50 euro for the watercolor art not for the oil painting...
3578 2018-05-04 23:18:03 Omg I just got out of the shower and tried on the vanilla amaretto  body oil from Cream and Coco and it’s to die for !
3579 2018-05-04 23:17:52 Are they really always that aggressive? It came out of nowhere from deepwater and at full speed head butted a board that was 4 times its size. And it was the creepiest looking creature I've ever seen - looked like an oil slicked shark crossbred w a demon!
3580 2018-05-04 23:17:44 Pussy taste like it need an oil change
3581 2018-05-04 23:17:33 This guy reminds me of a snake oil salesmen on Gunsmoke

3586 2018-05-04 23:16:55 I like Thousand Island but usually use an oil and vinegar type dressing to cut down on calories and added sugars!  #NationalSaladMonth
3587 2018-05-04 23:16:51 But don’t they also have an environmental impact and result in the death of animals? Palm oil is the most sustainable oil, but people like orangutans more than mice.
3588 2018-05-04 23:16:43 So I called early asking for the price of my truck  b/c they diagnosed it when I got a oil change a few weeks ago. Dude told me $60. Got there same dude didn’t know what he was doing so called for help correct price $500+...FML
3589 2018-05-04 23:16:43 Where’s the investment in Alberta’s oil industry?
3590 2018-05-04 23:16:32 As a Catholic, I'm at a loss at how the Catholics in this admin past/present & who support this oil slick of a president can live with themselves: Mercer, Bannon, KConway, JKelly, Spicer, Nunes, PRyan, MFlynn.
3591 2018-05-04 23:16:00 Oil share screams buy.  

If there were one thing that would make you nervous being long oil here what would it be?
3592 2018-05-04 23:15:49 True, but in a practical sense I wonder if it’s legally possible to violate the Logan Act unless you imply or explicitly say you represent the USA. I mean, at this point, so much international business, like oil and gas or steel or other commodities could damage US foreign policy
3593 2018-05-04 23:15:22 Welp. Send in the EPA. 89 degree high today in NJ and first coconut oil spill of 2018 at my house.
3594 2018-05-04 23:15:18 And you want to talk about bailouts? See how the #Trump administration has fed banks tax cuts and companies with massive offshore accounts to a free pass.  So who are these crony capitalists of which you speak? Not oil, bank, tech and military interests?  Or are they exempt?
3595 2018-05-04 23:15:17 Check your Transmission oil this morning.

3602 2018-05-04 23:14:23 this would be a private industry thing, not a govt thing, and isn't the #CPC heavily in bed with the oil industry?
3603 2018-05-04 23:14:02 That "egregious lack of integrity" was on display when Spanky was a guest and gave Oz that dictated letter from Dr Feelgood plus his test results and Oz interpreted them on the fly. He was an eminent cardiosurgeon. He's a snake oil salesman now.
3604 2018-05-04 23:13:40 Just bought a $200 straightener for $100 and oil , shampoo & conditioner free with that lol bless up homie you still ain’t getting my number

3608 2018-05-04 23:13:02 I’m watching Loco pour two bottles of cooking oil in a pan to fry burgers and I audibly said “oh no.” #ItsDangerousBeyondTheBlankets
3609 2018-05-04 23:13:01 I am told it’s a real thing. Pretty sure someone told me it is used more in gas wells than oil wells.
3610 2018-05-04 23:12:48 How fucking convenient. 

I need to abandon my intellect, eh?

Where can I buy the snake oil to help me find God's spirit?
3611 2018-05-04 23:12:35 I am 95% oil
3612 2018-05-04 23:12:35 No, instead they are oligarchs who don’t care about any energy industries besides coal and oil. 

We should be focusing on nuclear and renewable energy. But none of those industries are near as profitable as oil and coal.
3613 2018-05-04 23:12:33 tea tree oil on cartilage piercings >>>
3614 2018-05-04 23:12:13 Rachel, you were awe inspiring.  He came back with same old same old.  What kind of question is “Would you rather have an even worse company?”  Facts aren’t a matter of perspective. They are the facts.  Oil companies say the same thing.
3615 2018-05-04 23:12:06 Get some kitchen roll to get rid of loads of that oil.
3616 2018-05-04 23:11:39 I was a member of the NRA for years, when hunting in Alaska. Then the NRA got involved in "UNION" busting for "Big Oil", how about thum apples. We all quit our membership, the Valdez chapter of the NRA folded and when a spokesperson showed up, was run up of town.
3617 2018-05-04 23:11:33 They used to process oil from Venezuela too.
3618 2018-05-04 23:11:23 Honestly I just like olive oil and red wine vinegar
3619 2018-05-04 23:11:14 Ready to oil my body up & beat my face 
3620 2018-05-04 23:10:44 For Sen. Bennet “clean energy” = fracked oil and gas aka fossil fuels when he says clean tech he means continuing to bolster us the extraction of fossil fuels while using technology to try to deal w/ some of the emissions. Climate scientists say no new fossil fuel extraction!
3621 2018-05-04 23:10:41 What a great day for a little cbd oil and a long relaxing nap!
3622 2018-05-04 23:10:37 I feel weird not doing my own oil change

3626 2018-05-04 23:10:18 If you suffer from oily skin, use a clay mask once a week to remove excess oil while opening & clearing out pores.
3627 2018-05-04 23:10:12 @AaronGoodwin do you use acrylic or oil paint? And if you’ve used both, is there one you like better than the other?

3629 2018-05-04 23:09:15 Oil spillage in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria ruined the lives of thousands of farmers and fishers in the Niger Delta.

3631 2018-05-04 23:08:55 I didnt have any dinner so I just mixed a whole load of peanut butter, coconut oil, soft cheese and cacao powder in a bowl.

It's weirdly tastey, like eating cake batter off  a mixing spoon.
3632 2018-05-04 23:08:41 @WBrettWilson do you know? Is there a report, out there, of the consequences of, hypothetically, shutting down all oil sands production? Job losses, government budget $ reduction, funding cuts to ? Programs, etc, etc?
3633 2018-05-04 23:08:39 Yeah.   Eggs don't actually need much heat to cook, but can over cook fast in omelette form especially.   I keep mine super low.  Also use xtra virgin oil and not just butter.  Much higher burn temp with the oil so it works better
3634 2018-05-04 23:08:35 Someone earlier said that Daniels had been drilled more often than Oklahoma oil field.  I said they were wrong.  Texas is a bigger state.

3640 2018-05-04 23:07:22 The official changing of the seasons shouldn’t be marked by some highly inaccurate date on the calendar, but by when your coconut oil liquifies.
3641 2018-05-04 23:07:18 Ha, I don’t know!  Many people do it anyways!  A TBSP of oil is 100 calories, maybe if a TBSP or more is removed, maybe?

3649 2018-05-04 23:06:45 I highly recommend that Rudy Giuliani start taking 3000 mg of pure fish oil a day and 60 mg of statins for his #Senility  it's been working very well for me and I'm older than Rudy.
3650 2018-05-04 23:06:38 In the coming weeks and months, geopolitical risks could further boost oil prices in a market that hasn’t been this tight in years. The main risks to oil supply could come from the Middle East, North Africa, and Venezuela...zh
3651 2018-05-04 23:06:19 Is there an analysis, out there, of the consequences of, hypothetically, shutting down all oil sands production? Job losses, government budget $ reduction, funding cuts to ? Programs, etc, etc?
3652 2018-05-04 23:05:44 Pretty sure this lady at Marshall’s just tried to shoot her shot. I was buying candles and she asked what they were for. Then she noticed my Nakia shirt and said “I see you got me on your shirt. That’s nice.”
Then she suggested I buy oil and strawberries and we could have a night
3653 2018-05-04 23:05:43 Is there a superior safe asset?  We can mentally masturbate all we want about gold and oil, and Chinese bonds, but in their current iteration and legal framework, there is zero alternative.  None.
3654 2018-05-04 23:05:27 可愛がりすぎて手放せなくなるなら可愛がっちゃダメ！って親の怠慢ですよね？可愛がるのが親のやること(自尊心の成長)だし一人で生きていけるようになったら遠くから見守る(手放す)のが親ですよね？と思う。親からちゃんと愛されなかった派として今のうちに死ぬほど可愛がってあげて欲しい
3655 2018-05-04 23:05:17 I am sure there are more. Years ago I reported people for tweeting frightful things. Lots of people did. This seems like old news. She has gone through the most frightful abuse. Remember the target at the golf hole by those damned oil guys?
3656 2018-05-04 23:05:16 It could be more than 50%. China credit is a giant bubble about to EXPLODE.  Oil speculation just made a new all time record net long. And Michael Burrys Scion Asia LP is buying up all the China bond credit default swaps banks are willing to sell. Crash is soon.

3661 2018-05-04 23:04:38 While he is constantly saying he wants to shut down the Alberta oil sands blocks pipelines all in the name of saving the planet.  So stop all oil imports to go along with Alberta shut down.  VOTE CONSERVATIVE!
3662 2018-05-04 23:04:06 I can't! Too muxh oil. My lips keep slipping off
3663 2018-05-04 23:03:54 Nothing wrong with lathering up with coconut oil on your skin to help keep it looking nicer. Also moisturize your face every night. Anti aging stuff is bs but you should certainly care for your skin. It's your bodies biggest organ
3664 2018-05-04 23:03:54 Gieerellllll you better cop that castor oil.
3665 2018-05-04 23:03:48 Wash your face with whatever soap you trust, witch hazel & then grape seed oil. Has my skin texture soft af and clears up all breakouts/blackheads

3669 2018-05-04 23:02:58 Stop lying to Canadians.This is an export pipeline. It wont stop imports.
  
And regardless,  500% more oil is exported than imported. Oil is a freely traded commodity.

Do people want to nationalize the industry?

3700 2018-05-04 22:58:54 “@Phillips66Co will build the Gray Oak Pipeline to carry crude oil from the Permian Basin to the Texas Gulf Coast and hold a second open season to gauge interest in a system expansion.”
3701 2018-05-04 22:58:40 And the price of a barrel of oil is far less than the last time we were being gouged.
3702 2018-05-04 22:58:32 By using any type of technology to post on Twitter, you are using products produced by industries targeted by the carbon tax. Do you know what plastic comes from? Oil.
3703 2018-05-04 22:58:25 Tonight’s car count of 35 at Valley sets a new series record for entries at a stand-alone event!

3704 2018-05-04 22:58:16 Exact same thought when I read that study. COPD inhalers and anti-hyperlipidemics are at peak oil.
3705 2018-05-04 22:58:08 Olive oil is a good hair oil no lie
3706 2018-05-04 22:57:54 Yeah, they need lard.  I've been to powwows where they're trying to make it [faux] "healthy" by using vegetable oil, and it's fried dough, but it's not frybread.  (Same for tortillas.)  Just eat it sparingly, FFS, like we do, and eat the real thing.
3707 2018-05-04 22:57:54 No worries. We all learn something new everyday. 
PS get the olive oil ones lol.

Then a portion of all oil changes that day can go to a children's fundraiser

3726 2018-05-04 22:54:24 Andrew Scheer and the UCP never wanted Kinder-Morgan to twin the pipeline to the coast,thier American backers want the oil to be processed in Texas where the Oil cos all reside,even canadian ones.

3728 2018-05-04 22:54:02 All of Allen's WD-40 is at the shop, so he used my coconut oil to grease the door hinges. I was mad at first, but it comes in the clutch when the baby is sleeping. But now our bedroom door won't stay open.

3734 2018-05-04 22:52:58 If subsides to the oil industry are a thing why? Basically printing money!
3735 2018-05-04 22:52:56 @423gray @GLeffler I don’t know if either of you need motor oil but I just heard a commercial where you can get a JJ bobble head with the purchase of 5 quarts of some brand at Advance Auto Parts.
3736 2018-05-04 22:52:47 Well, it won't be frybread.  It'll be fried dough, but only one thing is frybread (and only made with animal fats, none of this canola oil nonsense).
3737 2018-05-04 22:52:47 It’s pretty clear that is the state of things as they slowly poison our children via fracked oil and gas wells near/under homes, schools, and parks.
3738 2018-05-04 22:52:43 5153H
3739 2018-05-04 22:52:35 Yes on the mct oil. Maybe try sugar free amaretto sometime?  
3740 2018-05-04 22:52:35 And there is why you are wrong. This is a human problem, not an engineering one. People aren't machines. People are far more complex. You don't see hydraulic oil saying "I am not interested in piston pushing, I'll watch Hentai in my mom's basement on twitch for a living"
3741 2018-05-04 22:52:29 We do oil, salt, parmesan. I like lots of lemon but kids complain it’s sour.

3748 2018-05-04 22:51:50 Can I ask, who you are talking to? As far as I can see people are driving , flying, and using more gas and oil than ever. The leaders of the world are the ones who want to burn oil and gas.

3753 2018-05-04 22:51:08 Today I listened to Trudeau give millions to the auto sector.  How can he equate that to Climate Change is real and he wants to shut down the oil sands?  I more I listen to this double talk/action the more I can see that these Liberals have got to go!  VOTE CONSERVATIVE.
3754 2018-05-04 22:51:08 It depends on what tripped the light. As suggested either check your oil level via the dipstick or have someone do it. If it's not low then it's a maintenance reminder to have it changed. If so get it changed as soon as you can but it's not an emergency.
3755 2018-05-04 22:51:07 can’t wait to try this new beard oil I just bought  it smells so good 
3756 2018-05-04 22:50:52 And today, Canada is at a crossroads. We have the 2nd most known oil reserves in the world, and Liberals are ignoring the massive potential for national wealth and power. Instead they are steering us towards a Venezuela like future. (progressivism, globalism - madness).
3757 2018-05-04 22:50:45 Your finest glass of motor oil.

In all seriousness, most sensible of all the legions.
3758 2018-05-04 22:50:37 I just needed a oil change, I’m fckn sad
3759 2018-05-04 22:50:34 To many greedy separatists, it's only the money that matters.

Its oor oil.

      
3760 2018-05-04 22:50:32 History shows Climate Change is an unavoidable natural phenomenon that moves & kills populations. Human polutants just enhance it. that's also unavoidable unless we stop manufacturing goods, using oil & gas, stop heating our homes, stop cooking our food.  It's not  happening!

3766 2018-05-04 22:49:43 Thanks for report as Canada has always given away our Natural resourses and continue to give them away like oil reserves East Coast now!
Norway held out for a good oil price and got it people have 1 Trillion in Savings no debt and free university education we owe 1 Trillion !
3767 2018-05-04 22:49:43 The best thing about having a slow oil leak in your car (well, in my case, three) is that it'll never cost less to fix it than just buying oil and topping it off once in a while

3772 2018-05-04 22:48:26 So I think my MacBook is listening to me, or something on my MacBook is listening to my conversations. I've began to see ads for olive oil (extra virgin) on my YouTube very recently, but only after I've used it at home one time. I didn't look up anything olive oil related on any
3773 2018-05-04 22:48:14 Our tech priests are preparing blessings of oil and wire to appease the internet deities!!
3774 2018-05-04 22:48:13 Weird huh, these ppl siding with Supremists that applaud minority abortion and would like rate to go to 100%.
3775 2018-05-04 22:48:01  I don’t use just coconut oil it’s actually like a cream a body wash a skin care butter not just coconut oil.
3776 2018-05-04 22:47:58 This oil diffuser is probably the best thing I’ve purchased in a while.

3778 2018-05-04 22:47:44 No need to shut up! I take Celexa, Deplin, Lamyctal, Zinc, P-5-P, Synthroid, T3 Liothyronine, Vitamin D, and fish oil *every day* for this. Don't blame yourself for your brain being an asshole. It's as medical as diabetes. Exercise/therapy can help, but some brains are just mean.
3779 2018-05-04 22:47:41 Harper did nothing to grow the economy. He was stuck in oil and no other investment. To boot he decimated a billion dollar plus surplus & gave Canadians $160 billion deficit. CONServatives are CONS. They can't manage a budget but their good at giving their rich friends tax breaks

Changed the oil... still wouldn’t start! 
3801 2018-05-04 22:45:32 The oil industry does not elect our leaders. #downwithbigoil
3802 2018-05-04 22:45:31 Radha rosehip oil & hyaluronic acid serum boo!!!! I also cleanse my face with Raw Apothecary’s black soap and I love it- all from amazon!
3803 2018-05-04 22:45:23 Wow, thanks for that tip. I will buy some for my brother.  He works hard & needs it.  He made his own out of a bit of beeswax, and castor oil, but it smells kind of waxy & is a bit greasy.

3805 2018-05-04 22:45:03 @VinnieTortorich 2. Should i cut saturated fats and try to lower my cholesterol with fiber rich foods? Doc says to cut red meat, eggs, dairy and coconut oil. This is so fucking confusing.
3806 2018-05-04 22:44:56 Vitamin D3 is usually suspended in a oily substance. I recommend olive oil capsules as opposed to soybean oil, which is used most.
3807 2018-05-04 22:44:53 Tryna slick a can of oil #MrBiggsVoice
3808 2018-05-04 22:44:50 Doesn't dry !?! .... I will try it  maybe this oil will be exactly what I need for my dry skin  Thank you @farrahrized 
3809 2018-05-04 22:44:02 Iran must be sitting on a SHIT TON of oil fields...
3810 2018-05-04 22:43:57 Borrowing money to Libyans? Libya that has oil, gas, gold, uranium, trillions of freeze & hidden assets? Means you are working on the full dismantle of the country, destruction of the institutions therefore killing of Libyans. The war was inside Libya for now. 
3811 2018-05-04 22:43:55 The sanctions, if imposed, are meaningless as far as they can move oil to Asia and do not involve any direct USD transactions. Almost no impact on physical SD. The only thing that matters here is maritime insurance. But the "paper" oil prices will go nuts.

3817 2018-05-04 22:43:08 First off, you being a feminist and not a free thinker is so contradictory.
Why i can't understand the bio "muslimah, feminist". It's like oil and water. won't mix.

3827 2018-05-04 22:41:17 Was good years ago. Now just a snake oil salesman who sold out his medical license for fame and fortune.
3828 2018-05-04 22:40:55 You fill each empty square with a bit of MOTOR OIL to complete the zoning. It looks rather striking to you. You can hardly imagine that an up and coming young can trying to make it in the world would not be delighted to live in your fair district.

3832 2018-05-04 22:40:35 part 1 - removing makeup 

first I use coconut oil all over my face (including eyes) and massage for about 1 minute. then I wipe off the oil with a paper towel. afterwards I use a makeup wipe to get off excess makeup.
3833 2018-05-04 22:40:27 1) day late, mum’s cancelled minor op happened & all the staff, ambulance transport guys were lovely.
2) Driving about in sunshine & blossom (even if oil seed rape gives me hay fever)
3) sewing (pics if I ever finish) crazy patchwork is far harder than it looks,
3834 2018-05-04 22:40:25 I think the reason my car is overheating is because it is low on oil. Let’s continue to pray it’s not a head gasket.

3842 2018-05-04 22:39:20 The transistor was invented around 1950. I'm sure there was much concern over the those who manufactured slide-rulers and abacuses. Embrace the new, especially when it improves our lives. We'll still need oil and coal for a while, but it's time to start phasing them out.

3860 2018-05-04 22:36:35 This is dumb. Bad pacing, an insanely large and obvious plot hole that stretched across the entire movie, cloaking devices invented and then discarded, pointless subplots. You can whine about breaking a diachotomy all you want. The same twisted logic would excuse the prequels.

3876 2018-05-04 22:33:42 Wouldn’t that impact the oil industry he promotes?

3880 2018-05-04 22:33:07 The problem is universities are community hubs for more than the students.
For instance many homeopathy witch-doctors organize "talks" in universities to credit and sell their snake oil to distributors and desperate patients. They couldn't care less if students refute it or not.

3895 2018-05-04 22:30:11 So why ask? Be real, the companies are here for that oil, gas, not because they like us. It’s a business. Charge them.

3903 2018-05-04 22:28:46 With some help I went and replaced my air filter. Changed the oil and checked my brakes. Good day
3904 2018-05-04 22:28:44 The combination of US rates higher and oil prices up is a double whammy for EM oil importers that also have large external financing needs, i.e. Argentina and Turkey. Perhaps this is part of the reason recent days have been so violent for those two.
3905 2018-05-04 22:28:40 Oil changed, air fixed and full tank of gas. Best feeling!
3906 2018-05-04 22:28:39 I don't mind at all! You can just dilute it with water, about 15 drops of oil per half cup of water
3907 2018-05-04 22:28:32 I'm glad I took a break from farming today XD
I'm more bothered by this time/out glitch though DX

I'll resume farming tomorrow, I think I'll have 7000 oil

3913 2018-05-04 22:27:56 The west has indeed lied, yes sinned, and did it to force President Assad out of office. Assad has no love for the big oil barons whom he refuses to allow to build an oil pipiline from Sunni Saudi Arabia across Syria to undercut the Russian oil supply to europe. Thus false news.

3920 2018-05-04 22:27:17 Ya know how they say don't cook bacon with your shirt off? Well, I cooked pork with no pants on and ended up with about a tablespoon of hot oil spilling on my leg.

3938 2018-05-04 22:24:47 So whay is the new wonder oil that is currently the flavour of tbe month with scientists? Or are the scientists still searching the NYSE for the answer?
3939 2018-05-04 22:24:46 I’m was scared to use hair gels but all that changed once I tried the eco styler black castor oil and flaxseed gel!!! The amount of hold I have in my hair is amazing!!

3944 2018-05-04 22:24:09 Took my CBD oil today, and had no discontinuation symptoms today so far. I'm really hoping it helps ease the mood swings some. It isn't a miracle drug, but I am willing to try it for awhile.
3945 2018-05-04 22:24:03 Coconut oil makes everything better. That’s all

3949 2018-05-04 22:23:06 Well the oil price is rising rapidly so if it depends on that I don't see why.
3950 2018-05-04 22:23:00 I wish @DevaCurl had a serum or hair oil I could use. I like to maintain healthy hair but I don’t want to always wear it curly. It’s more work than I’m willing to do in all honesty

3962 2018-05-04 22:21:29 I made a batch with avocado oil and one has to acquire a taste for it I think. Love it on my face! You'd have to get a fractionated coconut oil (to remain liquid) increasing cost somewhat and diminishing some quality. Next batch I might try MCT oil. Date and coconut.

3966 2018-05-04 22:20:43 also. does anyone else use the restroom seat cover as an oil blotter? that shit works wonders. but when other ppl walk in seeing a toilet seat cover over your face, they judge you. so just fair warning. #isitjustme #beautytips

Oil is critical to your national security.

3996 2018-05-04 22:17:18 Even if it's all BS, we should be converting to renewable energy anyway. The amount of oil on this planet is fixed, and it is useful in many other ways than burning. Trump ditches solar programs in favor of coal programs, yet solar has ten times the workers. Times change.

4003 2018-05-04 22:16:21 Poured water into a pan of boiling olive oil to clean it after cooking. Oil exploded everywhere including a drop that sailed up and hit my left lower eyelid, right on the eyelashes. So close to being blinded. My eyelid swelled up so bad I could barely open it.
4004 2018-05-04 22:16:21 There might be a good coupon for an oil change at a Sinclair station in there.

4007 2018-05-04 22:15:50 I'm not advocating for total Socialism.  But you're speaking as if Socialism itself is the cause of Venezuela's problems. Maybe it was Venezuela's untenable economic dependence on oil sales in the 80's & 2000's that led to devastation in both decades, the latter still felt today
4008 2018-05-04 22:15:46 Ok then. I suppose I'll have to trust in the blokes from the country that gave us The Crocodile Hunter and 90's rock band Midnight Oil.

4011 2018-05-04 22:15:06 The oil industry has next to nothing to do with the SNP.  It’s very much a reserved matter. Are you aware how the global Oil industry works?

4. All irrelevant as future transport is a service model.

That Venezuela was sanctioned by the US in 2011, 2013, 2014 and in 2015 the sanction on their oil trade by Pres. Obama included withholding of revenues from a PDVSA subsidiary? But, socialism, right?

4222 2018-05-04 21:43:35 Even if this is true, pragmatically it makes sense considering how many animals are killed annually in animal ag industries & the harm this causes.

There are many campaigns run/backed by vegans focusing on fishing, fur, leather, palm oil, whaling, hunting, etc.
4223 2018-05-04 21:42:47 Has Burma got any oil or precious metals? No .... so no chance of us invading them then .... just saying
4224 2018-05-04 21:42:37 ....Christ, *I* can fry chicken. ...I just don't because I don't like hot oil hitting me in the arm.

4227 2018-05-04 21:41:34 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Why are Oil/Gas Prices Going UP In USA?! US has ENOUGH to Drill HERE & NO Reason To Be Controlled By Strange Nations. Let Europe & Asia & Middle East Who Don’t Mind Paying, HAVE Overseas Oil & Let’s HELP MAGA & Make American Goods AFFORDABLE!
4228 2018-05-04 21:41:09 Will never forget the time me and @rossphelan98 told a bloke that a bottle of olive oil was a bottle of tequila and he guzzled the bottle, what an iconic moment
4229 2018-05-04 21:41:06 Is it confirmed blood tho.... Or robot oil??
4230 2018-05-04 21:40:58 Okay I’m done waiting for Maran to do my oil change  boutta go return everything and just take my car to a shop
4231 2018-05-04 21:40:47 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
4232 2018-05-04 21:40:46 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
4233 2018-05-04 21:40:42 I kinda have half my closest here at Aaron’s place and well my car is get an oil change and now that we want to go to the gym I have all my shoes either at my house or car and now I can’t go

4235 2018-05-04 21:40:36 No porque no sea inmediato significa que no puede suceder. Me imagino que eso también es parte de la broma. Ajá.

4240 2018-05-04 21:39:20 MAAAANNN 90% of my first oil change was trying to loosen these 2.
4241 2018-05-04 21:39:05 This that baby oil weather 
4242 2018-05-04 21:38:54 Very much like oil companies changed the names of ships, like Valdez and similar.

4245 2018-05-04 21:38:03 Put lavender oil on it!!! Takes the pain right away!
4246 2018-05-04 21:38:00 A spoonful of canola oil + a few drops of soap in water will kill mites and aphids. But don’t use it in hot, sunny, weather, as the soap will cause leaves to burn. #BSCgrows
4247 2018-05-04 21:37:58 Safety features made cars more expensive, too. And it’s cheaper to pour motor oil on the ground than recycle it. But mature cultures do the longer-term, better thing.
4248 2018-05-04 21:37:42 America fights for G.O.D

4249 2018-05-04 21:37:36 The biggest oil killers are happening right now and getting cheaper every day. EV cars are already lifetime cheaper than ICE, soon they will be the same purchase price. Alternative fuel trucks are already hitting the roads.
Anheuser Busch just bought 800 hydrogen fuelled trucks.
4250 2018-05-04 21:37:30 my mom just got a package in the mail with toilet paper, olive oil spray & aluminum foil....like wyd
4251 2018-05-04 21:37:29 For soup, cook diced onion in oil, then simmer with chicken, garam masala, vegetable broth and asparagus. Top with pickled jalapenos.
4252 2018-05-04 21:37:20 Tonight Chef has prepared  Grilled Pacific Swordfish paired with a robust tomato couscous, roasted zucchini & squash duo, and finished with an herb infused oil.  Our soup is tomato basil with fresh parmesan.  

We hope to see everyone in!

what an amazing word/idea
4254 2018-05-04 21:36:31 Saudia Arabia, once the premiere oil exporter sets their country’s gas prices at $2.04. Now that USA is becoming leader in oil production, why is our gas $2.75?
#gouging. When you have too much of a product, price goes DOWN. #FreeTrade
4255 2018-05-04 21:36:30 For example, (although I paid him back) my dad got me my 1st car & aleays took care of it for me. Whether it was new tires, oil change, smog, whateva.

4257 2018-05-04 21:36:26 Pastor Jeffress, where did you go to snake oil peddling school?
4258 2018-05-04 21:36:23 In regards to the new tirade of lies spewing like a ruptured oil pipeline coming out of the White House, you should watch @mulaney’s new special Kid Gorgeous on @netflix. Specifically his bit about a horse loose in a hospital.  
4259 2018-05-04 21:36:22 Oil is fucking me like I had a drink with Bill Cosby
4260 2018-05-04 21:36:10 I love real truffles! Real truffles shaved on (almost) everything, please. Truffle oil? Chemical garbage.

4267 2018-05-04 21:35:48 Oil changes at new places are so stressful for some reason. 
4268 2018-05-04 21:35:41 Definitely a different time. Just saw a doco on midnight oil in 1984. Live music is so different now.
4269 2018-05-04 21:35:35 its Oakley oil drippin from the wals

4273 2018-05-04 21:35:05 I'm about to time these bitches at Express Oil Change! #10Minutes
4274 2018-05-04 21:35:05 haha well said... it was a 20-year-old 250k mile Corolla, still driving, but burning 1qt oil per week. I was hoping it would just need the valve seals replaced, which is about the sweet spot of what I'm looking to do next. If piston rings... 
4275 2018-05-04 21:34:45 @tasty hey I know someone is allergic to tree nuts so for that challah bread you used coconut oil with the veggie one can I use sunflower or corn Oil and sesame oil those vegetarian oil's
4276 2018-05-04 21:34:41 Good truffles are great in moderation. The oil is fake and made of snake. ;-)
4277 2018-05-04 21:34:39 I need to be high. But good news! I got some CBD oil today! Woohoooo
4278 2018-05-04 21:34:39 I'm gonna write that down.  Thanks!

4285 2018-05-04 21:33:46 Oil
4286 2018-05-04 21:33:40 Are you saying that Quebec and Atlantic Canada would be opposed to domestic oil in their jurisdictions? Alternatively, are you saying that the federal Liberals are opposed to domestic oil in those jurisdictions? #cdnpoli
4287 2018-05-04 21:33:30 Mr. Trump can you see it from your house?  Are you gonna be safe?  Do any of your children work on oil rigs or ships or piplines?
4288 2018-05-04 21:33:12 When was your last oil change?
4289 2018-05-04 21:32:37 If we include the effect of falling SO2 emissions from coal, these effects will be much greater than predicted from GHG emissions alone. All the more pressure to shift rapidly away from oil and natural gas to renewables.
4290 2018-05-04 21:32:24 Not as mad as i would be when i see a old 3rd generation oil tycoon who drinks Whiskey 5x's a day , smokes cigars and rides around in golf cart as excersise. and cuts the donor line for a heart transplant bc he can afford top healthcare and call in a couple favors. Yeah #GTFOH
4291 2018-05-04 21:32:20 .@Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!

4299 2018-05-04 21:31:13 psa: coconut oil seals in moisture better than it provides it! after a shower, put on some light lotion, let it sink in, THEN apply coconut oil over it. if you use it in your hair, mix it with jojoba oil, argon oil, or olive oil then apply to your hair...it’ll change ya life

4310 2018-05-04 21:30:12 Think you'll find the oil son Scotland's coast has been subsidising Britain since the 70's and still is. Without those revenues coming in no matter the fluctuation Britain would be broke.
4311 2018-05-04 21:30:01 Fire was stopped in time. Fencing set alight and some of flames were higher than houses. Fortunate didn't catch oil tanks

4319 2018-05-04 21:29:06 Shit, Canadians are too nice to put this smarmy little shit on them.  He's a Cuban who fell out of his mommy near the oil fields in Canada.  Hell, I'm sure Cuba doesn't want to claim him either.
4320 2018-05-04 21:29:01 America got independence in 21st century... from whom?? Yes of course....when you attack another country for oil....you have to pray a small price.... no matter how heroically you die... you will be remembered as an invader in history

4326 2018-05-04 21:28:13 The real strange reason that MSM believe that is they are one with the government and military industrial complex and would love to steal resources and oil from Syria. Same old script, just like we did in Iraq as the oligarchs now control and profit from Iraqi oil.

4333 2018-05-04 21:26:32 I do not see 'sold off our oil' as you claimed.

Please clarify.
4334 2018-05-04 21:26:20 Oil man sold me something I’m surprised he parted with.
4335 2018-05-04 21:26:18 even south of Kwara, you’ll see them
4336 2018-05-04 21:26:14 Nigeria is not doing anything. Just riding out the oil cycle. These ones are trying to solve structural problems. I will still bet on them
4337 2018-05-04 21:26:11 +$70 oil coming next week.

4340 2018-05-04 21:25:17 Can I rub some coconut oil on my life?
4341 2018-05-04 21:24:48 apparently since 1960, each acre of the Niger delta has been the recipient of 40 gallons of spilled crude oil.

a gallon is 4.5 litres..., this article is blowing my mind
4342 2018-05-04 21:24:44 There is a science to non renewable energy such as coal,crude oil and natural gas. All mined products are decomposed organisms from a specific time period on earth called the Carboniferous Period.
4343 2018-05-04 21:24:41 John likes Oatly for lattes, but the thing I'm not crazy about is how much oil they put in it - and it's not a great quality oil. Personally, I love Milkadamia (macadamia milk) and they have a barista version that's awesome.
4344 2018-05-04 21:24:37 At the moment oil would be my favorite medium.
4345 2018-05-04 21:24:30 I'm probably the 99th person to post this, but just in case, no you don't. But.. it's short for "involuntary celibacy".
4346 2018-05-04 21:24:09 Use the c8 chain of mct oil (caprylic acid). It won't oxidize, is way less viscous (blends easily) and is by far the healthiest. I've made 3 batches of c60 w/it.
4347 2018-05-04 21:24:01 Yes Ian, currently there are some products that don't have replacements yet. But not all bio plastics are biodegradable.
And there is a good chance we will never see an end to oil companies, but we can see a 70-80% drop in their markets.
And there is an end coming for tar oil.

4351 2018-05-04 21:23:43 J. Paul Getty's advice for success: "Rise early, work hard, strike oil."
4352 2018-05-04 21:23:26 Sunscreen is so toxic,why would you suggest wearing it?  Have you ever read the ingredients.  100% organic coconut oil is a natural sunscreen.  Use that instead!
4353 2018-05-04 21:23:23 ...or that it *is* a member of the opioid drug family. Snake oil salesmen hype up minimal differences to gain prestige, power, control over others
4354 2018-05-04 21:23:17 I lived across from the east end relay station beside INCO during its hay days and we had a houseful of oil lamps on standby because hydro was always going out. 50 years later things haven’t changed I see
4355 2018-05-04 21:23:14 “Not your Daddy’s oil” is a clever rouse but doesn’t change the fact that it’s our descendants’ planet!
4356 2018-05-04 21:22:50 CBD oil is an amazing thing
4357 2018-05-04 21:22:49 I vote for the oil. I started taking @NaturesUltra oil two weeks ago for same stuff that you mentioned and i feel like in 3 days of taking it i started sleeping better and anxiety went down. Good luck finding something to help. Insomnia and anxiety are no joke
4358 2018-05-04 21:22:45 csp has some oil brushes. I like using the 'oil paint flat brush' some times but I mostly stick to a basic round brush because it's very versatile.
4359 2018-05-04 21:22:29 As long as there isn't a mine, fracking site, gas site or oil drilling right outside the boundaries.  Please fight with me to keep our park air clean, water pure and night skies dark.
4360 2018-05-04 21:22:21 I really liked the Fenty foundation. It’s matte and it doesn’t leave you with a wet dewy finish. With the born this way foundation you just have to use a good setting powder so it’ll soak up the oil in your face. I went from too faced to Fenty and It’s a big difference.

4363 2018-05-04 21:21:30 Oklahoma (like most southern states) is one of those red states that used to be blue, and is now slowly recovering from the damage. Lol..just like my state, Louisiana. The economy is based oil and crops. One took at hit thru regulations, the other took a hit thru lower prices.
4364 2018-05-04 21:21:26 What? so oil and water don't mix after all? Doh.

Crazy old man in a bar talk!

4427 2018-05-04 21:11:16 Yeah. Theres a fine line beteeen allowing a marketplace of ideas, and letting someone sell ideoligical snake oil without censure. Worse, the snake oil salesman are skilled at straddling that line.

4432 2018-05-04 21:10:09 Raved about consuming coconut oil for years but it's still surprising me. After months of not having any oil, I finally started consuming it again this week and it's already helped an insane amount with my (potentially arthritic/ligament damage) knee pain! 
4433 2018-05-04 21:10:09 Russia and Saudis benefit from higher oil prices. Watch those gas pump prices keep rising. ........

4438 2018-05-04 21:09:34 The problem is that Rosatom's floating nuclear power plant fleet is designed to power new oil, gas and coal extraction. Not good for the climate. Leave it in the ground, power the North efficient and renewable!

4451 2018-05-04 21:06:21 Very true. Tough go in Canada. 6months for states to build pipeline and Canada 16 years.  Very sad considering how safe pipeline are overall. Let’s import oil from saudis lol. Makes 0 sense. Oh well.  When the govt runs outta money and handouts stop I’ll just laugh
4452 2018-05-04 21:05:59 Every time I curl my hair I always get compliments on how thick my hair is and how does my curls hold it and all I basically do is not put conditioner on my hair and put the tarte Maracuja oil for some shine 
4453 2018-05-04 21:05:58 Snake oil....goes with the snake
4454 2018-05-04 21:05:48 I use salmon patties from Costco; I cut them into cubes (while still partially frozen, it’s easier), toss w a little olive oil & pimienta, y lo doro debajo del broiler, dándole la vuelta una vez. Podrías eliminar el aceite para economizar calorías.

4459 2018-05-04 21:05:25 Had a mould problem in a suit once. Surgical spirit and Teatree oil got rid of it.
Maybe I should bring one of my  suits up  that was designed to be used in water. That would urn a few heads! Sadly I probably wont be returning to this con.

4465 2018-05-04 21:04:48 What American culture do you speak of? Not talking about Native American culture here , do you mean imperialism, invasion of foreign countries for oil and racism?
4466 2018-05-04 21:04:46 Even trump’s turd smells like essential oil to them
4467 2018-05-04 21:04:32 It can either be a "real coup," or an abortive attempt a la Turkey. I won't say "false flag," since there are legitimate reason to want the current regime gone.

Given Syria as an example, Russia might allow some level of war to break out, only to come in & secure oil resources.
4468 2018-05-04 21:04:02 Palm oil is 100% the problem

4473 2018-05-04 21:03:10 Well last time I went getting a new pill and he said it should help but it hasn’t, problem is I don’t have oily skin and they normally stop your glands producing oil so I dunno what to do :( are u taking anything for it? Xx
4474 2018-05-04 21:03:00 I take a  lime flavored CBD oil and it tastes pretty good. It’s like liquid candy.
4475 2018-05-04 21:03:00 I take my car for a simple oil change, it then turns into my back brakes and tires are corroded, and then when “It’s all fixed” the moment I take it out to leave, it emits this terribly loud sound and now something is else is wrong. I didn’t even make it a mile.
4476 2018-05-04 21:02:51 Because that boy so slick he's practically oil?
4477 2018-05-04 21:02:34 Precisely, that's why messing around with Rastan pocket which was dormant and not a threat instead of cleaning up #DeirEzzor is a 2nd hughe mistake. Damascus can lose big here. In fact they would have had Omar oil field if they hadn't sent Tigers to Hama after Madan.

4482 2018-05-04 21:02:02 Renewables (including hydro) were 18% of power in the US during 2017. 
Nukes were about 19%. The remainder was pretty evenly split between coal and gas. Tiny portion for oil.
4483 2018-05-04 21:01:38 Getting an essential oil diffuser for my kids’ bathroom was one of my better decisions.

4496 2018-05-04 21:00:27 Lie. Canada is carbon neutral. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil is more environmentally friendly than more than half the oil produced on the planet. Did you notice that Canada’s has the greatest environmental regulations?
4497 2018-05-04 21:00:21 Agree. CBD oil and  = feel good
4498 2018-05-04 21:00:19 Yawn. All micro spills. Much less than the rest of the world’s producers. Canada’s Gay friendly and environmentally friendly Oil should replace dictator oil.  Tides protestors only obstruct Canada’s oil. @VaughnPalmer @MikeSmythNews

4505 2018-05-04 20:59:47 So much for the Indonesian Government being the stewards of their environment. Palm oil should be ethically grown , but Palm Oil plantations are dead zones to all creatures other than palm rats and palm snakes. Too few consumers give a dam about what is happening
4506 2018-05-04 20:59:44 A box of ten favourite books to read to small children and. Carluccio's hamper of pasta, sauces, cheese, olive oil and wine!
4507 2018-05-04 20:59:38 I finally smelled patchouli essential oil and... I can see why certain fictional characters get it assigned as a signature scent by the author

4511 2018-05-04 20:58:48 stopped putting heat to my hair. a lot of oil treatments + deep conditioning, I did finger coils for like a month so my pattern would come back & was consistent with my routine
4512 2018-05-04 20:58:43 Yeah I know u don't have oil, but it's the only thing that is collateral for the 2 trillion debt. Ever notice as each new oil find of billions of barrels comes along the debt increases equally. That's how much oil Scotland has, yet we are 2 wee and 2 poor
4513 2018-05-04 20:58:39 I feel like i get an oil change every 2 Months. Shittttttt
4514 2018-05-04 20:58:31 Skins dry- coconut oil

4515 2018-05-04 20:58:22 we’ve arrived at another night where my £40 little bottle of oil gathers dust and goes unused 
4516 2018-05-04 20:58:16 Wtf. I need another oil change 
4517 2018-05-04 20:57:41 Yes, that typically works but it's not working with gas and oil.  Notice how much price of gas increased since Trump took office?

4520 2018-05-04 20:56:46 You sir are a conman.  A snake oil salesman.  You did collude with Russia and you know it!!!
4521 2018-05-04 20:56:46 In Russia, the government controls several key industries such as oil and mining. They use the revenue to finance the government, so the Russians pay very little of their income in taxes. That is a far superior system to what we have in the United States.
4522 2018-05-04 20:56:18 CBD Oil + Caffeine is an amazing combination

4526 2018-05-04 20:56:00 @FieldsAuto My mom bought a CPO X1 two weeks ago from @bmwofasheville. The oil was not changed prior to purchasing. @bmwofasheville is telling me they can't help because she didn't notice it until today. Is changing the oil not a courtesy on a newly purchased vehicle? What gives?
4527 2018-05-04 20:55:47 Actually, my problem is they tend to be saturated with too much oil and brown.
4528 2018-05-04 20:55:44 Then why don't we see Cyprus oil in UK supermarkets
4529 2018-05-04 20:55:32 Pres Roosevelt takes America into the WW2 by refusing to sell Japan any more steel scrap or oil. Japan was totally dependent  upon the US for both steel scrap & oil.  Roosevelt knew this action would provoke the Japanese to attack America which they did at Pearl Harbor.
4530 2018-05-04 20:55:15 What is more important to Trump, trying to discredit Obama, or cripple America, with enormous hike in oil prices.....
4531 2018-05-04 20:55:12 @POTUS Hey Donald great job your doing. What as rd goi going to do about the rising gas prices.  There seems to be no real reason other then oil companies greed that they are on the rise. Let's fix that!
4532 2018-05-04 20:55:03 Everytime you want to fry egg may you realize there’s no oil after you’ve finished whisking it
4533 2018-05-04 20:54:56 Offshoring wind turbines is the idea of installing turbines off the coasts of populated areas in order to produce clean energy. Why is this important? As many know, non-renewable resources, such as oil,coal, and gas, when used to produce energy, emit harmful gasses into the air.
4534 2018-05-04 20:54:48 You could, I always tended to avoid using herbs as they might burn a bit. But if your mix is fresh enough it’d have enough of the flavoring oil to work.
4535 2018-05-04 20:54:42 Snake oil salesman. You have no values. It’s all about the almighty dollar with you.
4536 2018-05-04 20:54:04 as clear as motor oil in my '97 honda civic sitting in my driveway
4537 2018-05-04 20:53:55 CRY I will do that....later....I wanna have tea with you~~

4542 2018-05-04 20:53:37 I remember when my mother went 'healthy'. The lard pan was sadly replaced by sunflower oil in a 2 litre bottle

4545 2018-05-04 20:52:20 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
4546 2018-05-04 20:52:09 The guy snatched the phone and ran back towards the side of the bridge and jumped down. He had on only shorts. His body was glistening, guess he rubbed on oil. As he ran, we saw another dude running with him into the night.

4550 2018-05-04 20:51:20 The guy at raceway Nissan gave me a free oil change last time, the guy I got today told me that if I always get my oil change with him I’ll never have to pay 
4551 2018-05-04 20:51:18 Your drinking the Texas crude oil. Maybe you should take in the Texas sun or let your propecia hair blow in the Texas wind so our planet doesn’t burn like a tanning bed and turn to orange skin. If your “truth” changes for political reasons, it aint the truth.
4552 2018-05-04 20:51:17 He wants Iran’s oil and he is devious, manipulative and going to stop at nothing. He is sabotaging the nuclear deal with his lies and actions.
4553 2018-05-04 20:50:59 Every time i get an oil change the man who sold me my car always calls my damn phone like nigga wtf you want.... I’m here for an oil change don’t call me every time you see my name pop up n the system...tf
4554 2018-05-04 20:50:58 But when (WE) sell it we are actually giving it to USA oil companies who give us around %2 of the total worth in Royalties. They make a $billion for every $2 million for our natural resources!

4559 2018-05-04 20:50:52 During the last oil boom, the Canadian dollar rose above the US. That was responsible for the loss of manufacturing jobs in Ontario, lost agriculture and fishery sales, and lost jobs everywhere but AB.
4560 2018-05-04 20:50:48 Grabbing a roll, he cracks it open, his thumb piercing the crust, tearing it in half. He dips it in the oil, letting it soak. “Honestly, I don’t know. As you’ve just demonstrated, I have a reputation, rightfully earned too, that I need to overcome. I fear the next step is -

- Raptors bench all overrated

4566 2018-05-04 20:49:44 Ah that good Old worthless oil. According to ALL msm and the Tories the more oil Scotland finds the more worthless it is and the bigger our deficit Is, sadly the unionists amongst us believe it

4600 2018-05-04 20:45:44 When it comes to extractive industries like mining and oil and gas, the price is always too high. Unfortunately the minister has the power to grant licenses and the government is gung ho for trade deals with ISDS clauses. Even if the licence is withdrawn government can be sued.

4607 2018-05-04 20:45:02 Have you heard of WW II? Canada's economy was turned from peace to war production in a few months. In this case we have a few years, but the lack of oil does not mean a lack of prosperity.

4614 2018-05-04 20:44:11 I love rose and geranium. Lavender is okay but I find if it’s too intense it has the opposite effect on me. Love love love Rose though it has to be a really good quality oil though

4627 2018-05-04 20:42:06 “Fall in the global oil price... will result in increased tax revenue for government through...VAT”.  

Let’s clear this up with a numerical example. Assume VAT is 10%

Old price per unit £10, so tax revenue is £1.

Price per unit falls to £7, so tax revenue is now £0.70

4637 2018-05-04 20:41:39 On Harry Potter, what if you were trying to use the Expecto Patronum spell to stop a Dementor, but yelled out "Expecto Petroleum!" and oil blasted from your wand and got all over your clothes and face and your friend yelled "Ahhhh! Now you look like a Dementor" and backed away.
4638 2018-05-04 20:41:33 PRT6. I inspected the food, there were many pieces of meet cooking in oil, about three pieces were a little raw on the side, I flipped them over and put the lid back on. "Its almost done, a little bit longer." #Florida #Tsunami #Prophetic #Dream #JesusChrist
4639 2018-05-04 20:41:29 I told my doc that I wanted to try CBD oil, she's on board but she wants to do a li'l bit more research, got another appointment on June 4th. My therapist thinks it's a good idea.

4644 2018-05-04 20:40:52 Feta goes with tomato, olive oil, black pepper, crusty bread and nice red wine. And. Nowhere. Else.
4645 2018-05-04 20:40:40 Weve known this! How is that any crazier than like how our chemicals look all swirly, like just look at oil and how it can look like a rainbow
4646 2018-05-04 20:40:39 "This recipe is the best ever! I substituted chicken breasts for pork chops, white sugar for honey,Worcestershire sauce for soy sauce, I didn't have sesame oil, so I used canola, I don't like ginger so I left that out, and I doubled the amount of garlic. Yummo! Will make again!"
4647 2018-05-04 20:40:34 Norway is not socialist, it has a strong welfare state, but is still a capitalist country.  Also they have a conservative govt too who is cutting taxes.  They can afford that due to their wealth in oil.

4656 2018-05-04 20:39:16 Thank u so much Atilla; hoping this madness in oil ends next week and we get a nasty liquidation event. Cannot believe that the world's most important commodity can be so blatantly manipulated to favor one country. Height of stupidity, IMHO.
4657 2018-05-04 20:39:07 The UAE is not "sharing"  their oil with other countries when it trades. It is controlling it.
4658 2018-05-04 20:39:03 Despite most people’s assumptions having a degree means nothing. I know people who didn’t graduate high school and still make enough money to provide for them and their families and ARE NOT In the oil field. It’s what your degree is in when it comes to jobs. And experience.

4662 2018-05-04 20:38:13 Not to mention this oil is going straight to China. It's not staying here so Canadians don't have to buy U.S oil. 
4663 2018-05-04 20:38:09 Resource companies pay for damages. If the original company is gone, then the industry as a whole pays.  This is standard in OECD countries, from gravel companies to oil giants,
4664 2018-05-04 20:38:03 What is the average volume of these "spills"? And what percentage of these spills happened outside of oil facilities and containment?

Good thing you don't make any mention of that, or else your propaganda could never whip up any hysteria.
4665 2018-05-04 20:37:49 I`m not ignoring them. There are more jobs in green energy and refitting buildings per dollar of investment than there are in digging oil out of the ground. many oil patch jobs would translate without retraining. But keep writing about how great oil is. pays the bills I guess.
4666 2018-05-04 20:37:43 OIl is a drug and a curse. Just ask anyone in the ME.

4668 2018-05-04 20:37:28 I still do. The only way to cook fish and chips is in beef dripping. To feck with vegetable oil.

4733 2018-05-04 20:28:13 Now, add a small squirt of dish detergent and give it a shake.
Did the oil and water join together? This is because the soap acts as an emulsifier, or a bridge that connects the oil and water together. This is how your dirty dishes can become sparkling clean.

4762 2018-05-04 20:25:38 Mmm stunning I love oil you up Mrs x
4763 2018-05-04 20:25:37 Oil price dropped, it went into freefall before the NDP.  It's now going back up, and so are the jobs.  Jobs are not being eliminated due to higher minimum wage, that's a fallacy that's been disproven over and over again. Coal industry needs to go, it's horrible for the planet.
4764 2018-05-04 20:25:32 googles "garlic oil chemical burn"
im suffering. my fingers are suffering
4765 2018-05-04 20:25:22 I sleep in a stocking cap. But that's about it. I try to use oil to help with the itching.

4775 2018-05-04 20:23:21 And they will....if they don't starve em to death they can always concoct some excuse to send em off on an illegal foray into foreign lands for American oil.

4783 2018-05-04 20:21:57 Time to stock up on baby oil ladies
4784 2018-05-04 20:21:49 Where is Oil found?

Crude oil is found deep under the Earth's surface and has been there for millions of years.Oil is also found deep in the ocean's floor, but is more difficult to get at.There is also a form of oil found in plants.
4785 2018-05-04 20:21:40 I’m happiest with the temperature outside when my cooking coconut oil is in liquid form

4788 2018-05-04 20:21:10 I use @FreshBeauty seaberry cleansing oil  it looks crazy but gets everything off and doesn't dry out my already dry skin
4789 2018-05-04 20:21:08 Simple fact, jobs here are based on oil prices.  Oil companies are quick to fire, slower to hire back.  Oil prices are NOT controlled by any provincial government.
4790 2018-05-04 20:20:56 look like it's soon, Migration from Somalia with oil tankers hijacked to west
4791 2018-05-04 20:20:42 Yes, but Olive oil is better
4792 2018-05-04 20:20:38 I’m not going to tweeze my eyebrows for at least 6 months and I want to start using castor oil on them and my eyelashes. Hopefully I can see some growth/thickness 
4793 2018-05-04 20:20:14 Chiro: “You look...smaller. New diet or something?”
Me: “Since I saw you 3 days ago?”
“Maybe snake oil or...?” 
“...I swallowed a tapeworm.”
4794 2018-05-04 20:20:06 MORE snake oil!
4795 2018-05-04 20:20:03 Anigu waxaan weli ku maqnahay dagaalkii aan la galay Soma Oil and Gas iyo faragelinta shisheye ee #Somalia lagu hayo. Markaan ka guulaysto Insha Allah waxaan ku noolaan lahaa #Muqdisho

4797 2018-05-04 20:20:01 love you Brother,you don't send Satan in to do Father God's work sadly many ppl are in denial,especially given what they know about the RCC & all of it's Pedophilia & worshiping of Lucifer. Bible tells us this Pope will bring his ppl through the TRIBULATION. Oil on Fire is Bad
4798 2018-05-04 20:19:57 I got an oil change and suddenly Marge didn't sound so angry 
4799 2018-05-04 20:19:45 First, YES! I use lavender oil constantly and am always burning incense and/or candles when I feel like this. 

Second, you are such a gift thank you for your friendship and care. 
4800 2018-05-04 20:19:43 If any government decides to use the resources of their land for their own people- they get the hammer of the NWO brought down on them- Like Gaddafi.  If they don't let the oil companies steal their oil or if they even raise the rate-Hugo Chavez-economic or military war comes.
4801 2018-05-04 20:19:40 Getting an oil change then just gotta do a couple things and then I’ll mob
4802 2018-05-04 20:19:25 I trust what my body wants at any given time. Over the last couple of days it's wanted a bunch of pick n mix sweets (I bought some and have them in a big old fashioned candy jar) but also plenty of spinach in olive oil~

4804 2018-05-04 20:18:44 God first. With no standards you will be attempting unify oil and water.  Some things aren't meant to be mixed. 
#GodFirst
4805 2018-05-04 20:18:37 Has anyone noticed that gas prices have been going up since Trump?    Maybe all those new jobs are in oil. Trump's oil buddies got what they wanted.  During Obama, gas prices went way down  which helped the working class the most.
4806 2018-05-04 20:18:19 I have a friend in Brooklyn who is publishing a book on CBD oil and we spent a lot of time last Friday night talking about my arthritis and how it could help. I don't want the psychoactive effects though (she had a lot of good information on that).
4807 2018-05-04 20:18:05 No clean sheet again. Ffs United.
4808 2018-05-04 20:17:49 Today I've seen a politician use Star Wars to promote an oil pipeline, a bank use Malala Yousafzai to promote its product, and a band chastise a dj for not going down on his wife.

This entire website needs a damn drink.
4809 2018-05-04 20:17:36 Hope you got your oil changed, too!
4810 2018-05-04 20:17:34 Legit just done a face mask, then rose water wash, then face cream bc I'm gonna look after my skin better (and these are the things I've only got in my house atm, I need to pick more tea tree oil etc up) and my face feels so clean omg
4811 2018-05-04 20:17:29 Cuz they refuse to admit they were snookered by a snake oil salesman.
4812 2018-05-04 20:17:20 The press has covered the peso’s decline under EPN extensively. There were many causes, probably most critically the collapse of oil prices in 2014. Right now, currency mkts are reacting to the polls, so that’s the news focus. What you’re doing is what gringos call “whataboutism”
4813 2018-05-04 20:17:20 The boss of the Chinese company has been arrested in Hong Kong I think.. corruption or the like.. dodgy oil deals with the ruskies.
4814 2018-05-04 20:17:19 @Miguel you put mad coconut oil in your coffee yo! Lol do you put anything else in it?
4815 2018-05-04 20:17:09 Here’s some coconut oil and a hanky. Knock yourself out. 
4816 2018-05-04 20:17:07 Foods containing trans fats are primarily in processed foods made with trans fat from partially hydrogenated oil. Bad Cholesterol LDL
4817 2018-05-04 20:17:06 When the hertz rental people are 15 minutes late from there lunch break and you’re stuck waiting to get an oil change -.- #lyft #hertz #rental
4818 2018-05-04 20:17:06 We've sold out season tickets for the last 3 years. Celtic fans and facts are like oil and water, they don't mix
4819 2018-05-04 20:16:40 US Closing prices: #DOW 1.39% #NASDAQ 1.89% #Ftse100 0.86% #GBPUSD 1.3535 #EURGBP 0.8834 #EURUSD 1.1955 #Gold 0.01% #Oil 0.08%
4820 2018-05-04 20:16:32 The oil ministers from the OPEC cartel and a group of non-OPEC partners agreed Thursday to extend crude output cuts until the end of next year in efforts to keep supplies tight and bolster oil prices. One of those OPEC partners is Iran, one of those non-OPEC partners is Canada.
4821 2018-05-04 20:16:13 @Smother_Queen i want to oil you big butt
4822 2018-05-04 20:16:10 Jeff is a big man like a big guy not on some of you guys level here but humility makes him interact with everybody. He enjoys tweeting and he stands for what he believes but funny how some people insult him here.Oga for one of d top oil companies but let kpim
4823 2018-05-04 20:16:00 Kingsbury Oil Terminal is an oil storage depot located in Kingsbury, Warwickshire, England. It was opened in the late 1960s!!
Can you tell me what a oil depot does?
4824 2018-05-04 20:15:59 you troublemaker, you're trying to mix oil & water! :)
4825 2018-05-04 20:15:55 If I started selling c60 (often requested) what oil would people prefer? Bare in mind that the Olive Oil Market is about 97% scam and unhealthy, adulterated, often rancid or cut. And Coconut or Avocado Oil absorb better externally (Anti wrinkle reports)
4826 2018-05-04 20:15:52 Venezuela is a Socialist country completely dependent on the price of oil. Wall Street exchange rate "manipulation" wouldn't have this kind of effect – on an entire country – if they were a capitalist country in which everyone pursued their own interests.
4827 2018-05-04 20:15:49 I think there will be a Middle East conflict with Iran and will cause oil to shoot up. I just bought Vanguard Energy 10k. I think Iran conflict with US and Isreal is coming.
4828 2018-05-04 20:15:24 Start with oil, either in the pan or rub it over the steak after drying it and before seasoning. I chuck the butter in the pan after I put the steaks in and spoon the melted butter over the steak as it is cooking. But yes starting with butter may burn it, leaving an acrid taste.
4829 2018-05-04 20:15:16 Yes! Coco oil is super gentle on skin and moisturizing.
4830 2018-05-04 20:15:12 I just got finessed getting my oil changed, that’s what I get for not knowing shit 
4831 2018-05-04 20:14:54 Okay so apparently there is no vitamin C in Rosehip Oil  I always thought it was vitamin A and vitamin C and that’s what is repeated on the Internet like EVERYWHERE but I did a lot of research and there’s no quantifiable amount of vitamin C. only Vitamin A & Linoleic Acid.
4832 2018-05-04 20:14:34 I ran out of coconut oil a while ago and have been having to use olive oil for everything. Listen, I like olive oil, but it’s not for pancakes. :/
4833 2018-05-04 20:14:28 Notice they call it spill response and not spill cleanup.  That's because typically very little oil spilled in a marine environment is recovered (10-15%)
4834 2018-05-04 20:14:16 Well done.  Who controls the oil fields?  That's what I want to know.
4835 2018-05-04 20:14:11 My nails are so long & healthy, thank you castor oil.
4836 2018-05-04 20:14:06 It’s picking up, but the future of oil isn’t certain. The last drop cost them. I think they have a UAE on their mind.
4837 2018-05-04 20:13:55 Now y’all oil up.
4838 2018-05-04 20:13:44 I think oil is going to follow this and go parabolic. Those shorting oil will regret it.
4839 2018-05-04 20:13:26 I think it’s wonderful that you are leading the way in reducing plastic and palm oil products. You are putting the other supermarkets to shame. So proud that Iceland started in Oswestry. Just like Do it for David!
4840 2018-05-04 20:13:13 #JustinTrudeau has his catered food ferried to his house on oil and gas, guess he hasn't heard of #SkipTheDishes
4841 2018-05-04 20:13:09 The oil in that plate go reach cook like 2 pots of soup...
4842 2018-05-04 20:13:06 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.
4843 2018-05-04 20:12:59 You know #FFOS could get on a boat and in ppl face 24/7 to show you dead fish and oil spill but 500 acres your family own and you ain’t even chain yourself to a tree to save the turtles in protest ?
4844 2018-05-04 20:12:56 my car is getting an oil change rn but i’ll be there afterwards
4845 2018-05-04 20:12:45 Negative. rights of oil men. path to american freedom. rights to cause nuclear holocaust.
4846 2018-05-04 20:12:38 I’m so tired to do oiling can someone put oil in my hair. 
4847 2018-05-04 20:12:33 I remember that one.
4848 2018-05-04 20:12:11 Well damn. No more tarragon pita chips to go with the hummus.  First the wine is gone, now the good oil is out...Lee Ann Swanson, Rory Curtis - see y’all real soon!
4849 2018-05-04 20:12:11 My car won’t make it there unless I get the oil change and the air filter I apparently need
4850 2018-05-04 20:12:09 ha ha
4851 2018-05-04 20:12:00 TBF not spilling oil is hard on the profit margins. It's much better to cheap out and let taxpayers and insurance companies pick up the tab.
4852 2018-05-04 20:11:56 if anyone tells you to try Clove Oil tell them to go fuck themselves & run away.

It's worse than tppthache.
4853 2018-05-04 20:11:41 don't forget to throw Bombardier in with the oil burner companies ...
4854 2018-05-04 20:11:41 I was born in the #1 oil export country, today communist, but today 2 things : the unemployment rate at its low, and USA where I live #1 Oil exporter! Let’s make America Great Again! @realDonaldTrump @VP
4855 2018-05-04 20:11:40 If I could change my own oil in my car . I wouldn’t be at nobody’s shop forreal lol
4856 2018-05-04 20:11:39 I'm super curious about black seed oil!  I've been tempted but haven't pulled the trigger yet.
4857 2018-05-04 20:11:20 I need me some coconut oil 
4858 2018-05-04 20:11:10 That’s why no matter what we say about those blue cunts and their oil money behind the scenes the club is seemingly running better than ours look how quick they wrapped up deals
4859 2018-05-04 20:11:05 Allergies are so complexed like I can’t eat peanuts but I can eat food that has been in cooked in peanut oil
4860 2018-05-04 20:10:48 Went in to Whole Foods for literally ONE THING while waiting for my oil change and left with $20 worth of stuff 
4861 2018-05-04 20:10:38 There were so many problems with that podcast, and the biggest one was that Dean and Austin were like oil and water.
4862 2018-05-04 20:10:32 Justin Trudeau, Catherine McKenna & Kathleen Wynne just gave $200 million in corporate welfare to Toyota, a company that made a record $22 billion profit last year. Liberals save their anti-fossil-fuel vitriol for the industry that makes oil, not the industry that burns it.
4863 2018-05-04 20:10:20 髪がさーサラサラしてるのちょっと気にしてんだよなー
4864 2018-05-04 20:10:09 Ehn?? When there's baby oil..
4865 2018-05-04 20:10:07 With the power of baby oil and baby Jesus, I SOMEHOW fit my belly ring in.. I haven't worn it in a solid 2 years.
4866 2018-05-04 20:10:07 知ってる？スーパーってタダで牛脂くれるんだよ。
4867 2018-05-04 20:10:05 At the original advent of electric cars their growth was limited by lack of charging points - that was at the turn of the last century, and it was because so few houses had electricity.

It was only the discovery of huge oil reserves that effectively killed off electric cars then
4868 2018-05-04 20:10:02 Ten Hundred Yards of Lard Oil Buried beneath San Francisco by India Schank
4869 2018-05-04 20:09:51 today i gave my dog a bath, gave his flea meds, called his doctor, called my doctor & made an appt, and am currently getting an oil change. still lots left to do, but my point: PRODUCTIVITY IS SUCH A GREAT FEELING. i’m also working under pressure BUT IT FEELS GREAT.
4870 2018-05-04 20:09:22 So the estimated 2.5-3h took almost 5h. Brakes are fine and they only visually inspected them (Really !?!). Alignment is done (3 wheels were out of spec ) and oil change too. At least the car respond and feel nice now. Brakes feel a little better too.
4871 2018-05-04 20:09:20 For heaven's sake, everyone's so sensitive these days.  Get those hyped-up-hippo folks some soothing bath oil or cream for their hyper-sensitive hides.
4872 2018-05-04 20:09:16 On a great oil day, but my 3 energy names all crapped out today. $BTE earnings were fine, and they'll continue to be fine. $BXE and $CR.TO are gassy, and probably got sold to buy up more oil-based names. They'll be fine too.
4873 2018-05-04 20:09:12 This weekend could be a good opportunity to target the carp on the surface.

Top Tip: Soak your floaters in Chilli Oil to create a slick on the surface to improve your surface rig presentation and to enable you to spot bites far easier! 
4874 2018-05-04 20:09:09 Are they broke because of their socialism or the collapse of their over reliance on oil as the country’s source of income? Yes, I know they have a for poop head of state. We do too.
4875 2018-05-04 20:09:05 すまあってなに？
4876 2018-05-04 20:08:51 Lush Coalface. Jojoba oil to moisturize
4877 2018-05-04 20:08:35 Burn The Midnight Oil 
4878 2018-05-04 20:08:01 Had an oil leak from my outside boiler, a whole tank of oil has gone under my house & all the concrete floors have to be dug up & the contaminated ground removed. Massive job, will take 6 months so insurance company have arranged a rental for til it’s all done
4879 2018-05-04 20:07:54 What would you use to replace palm oil?
Palm oil have the highest yield/space, if you replace it, you need more space.
There is no easy solution, sadly.
Number one thing you can do: use oil only when you realy need it. Dont use oil for food, its unhealthy anyway.
4880 2018-05-04 20:07:51 A crowd full of morons lapping up the snake oil, fantasizing about the one in a million chance of one day taking out Black Bart with their Red Ryder.
4881 2018-05-04 20:07:49 Argentina's congress gave final approval to pay the Spanish oil giant Repsol £3bn in compensation for the nationalisation in 2012 of its stake in Argentine oil firm, YPF. The deal is seen as crucial in helping Argentina attract foreign investment in its shale oil & gas reserves.
4882 2018-05-04 20:07:45 Hmmm...

4885 2018-05-04 20:07:25 This is absolutely true. The Ordinary just released their Marula Oil and it’s super inexpensive. I’m excited to try it from them! I absolutely recommend retinol but only for people who have a solid routine already. Otherwise it can really damage your moisture barrier.
4886 2018-05-04 20:07:21 My skin on my face sometimes gets dry from tanning so I use almond oil that I got from Whole Foods. Leave it on over night and my skin is back to normal the next day.
4887 2018-05-04 20:07:16 CeraVe Hydrating Face Wash (or generic versions of that)

Aloe Gel/anything that is hydrating (hydrating and moisturizing are different - hydrating adds water and moisturizing adds oil)

CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion for Dry Skin

I use the Nyx Hydratouch primer and a hydrating(1/2)
4888 2018-05-04 20:07:11 “Another... impact (of a fall in global oil prices) is anyone who is the owner of a oil-reliant vehicle may be more likely to travel...and the cases of geographical immobility may fall” 

Whilst I can see why some might link these ideas, it is rather unusual.
4889 2018-05-04 20:07:08 Spiders hate peppermint oil. Put some in a squirt bottle + water and spray your garage and all door frames. 
Bye spiders!
4890 2018-05-04 20:07:06 Hysterical! Don't you ship all NYC garbage on barges out to sea & dump it??? Whats a few oil rigs in comparison to that environmental tragedy??
4891 2018-05-04 20:06:48 Snake oil salesman is appropriate for this Administration. What a quack.
4892 2018-05-04 20:06:40 “I’ll just bring some oil pants and a fucking easel.”
4893 2018-05-04 20:06:36 Lmfaoooooo I’m getting my oil changed and the guy had to move my car up and then comes inside and goes woooh people have been smoking today 
 I’m sorry I’m right here
4894 2018-05-04 20:06:33 motor oil isnt for drinking
4895 2018-05-04 20:06:30 Someone from Ulta  told me coconut oil would make me break out more  it’s like just on my forehead and its weird. Do you just put it on after you wash or what?

4897 2018-05-04 20:06:03 Lots of market milestones today: Dow jumps 332 points, erasing weekly loss. #Apple soars 13.5% on the week, its best since 2011. WTI oil closes at highest level since late 2014
4898 2018-05-04 20:05:53 It is backed by oil that's why they call it the petro-dollar and the main cause of oil wars.
4899 2018-05-04 20:05:49 melatonin + CBD oil can ease sleep & really can help with restlessness
4900 2018-05-04 20:05:45 WTI Crude Oil +1.9% at 69.72 bbl $USO
Gold +0.1% at 1314.70 oz  $GLD
Copper +0.3% at 3.09 lb $CU
4901 2018-05-04 20:05:44 Sometimes I step in tar at the beach - olive oil usually gets it off. Although I don't know if oil will stain the bottom of your shoe... could test it first.
4902 2018-05-04 20:05:37 Lick a pussy like a labyrinth, pop that pussy like olive oil. Big Dog.
4903 2018-05-04 20:05:31 Won't go over well with his oligarch oil company friends, either.
4904 2018-05-04 20:05:26 Coconut oil always breaks me out because it has a high comedogenic rating! Any natural makeup products like the rms concealer always gives me bumps under my eyes. Everyone raves about it but for me it’s a nightmare. I love jojoba oil it is lighter and has worked for me for years
4905 2018-05-04 20:05:20 Should have got some high quality snake oil for those knees! Then we could just call you 'Silent-but-dead-Knees'. I'll see myself out.
4906 2018-05-04 20:05:08 I'm taking about as much as you are minus the other opioids, but I potentiate with turmeric, fresh ground black pepper for piperine, Nigella sativa oil, and grapefruit (juice) and also ingest cannabis all day long
4907 2018-05-04 20:05:03 The indices at 11am yesterday began to reverse losses bouncing off their 200 day moving averages with the DOW adding 800 points in 2 sessions.
With all the volatility we end the week where we started. Oil touches $70 a barrel and we get a Goldie lochs jobs report.
4908 2018-05-04 20:05:03 How do you use the tea tree oil? I have some, but don’t have it part of my routine yet
4909 2018-05-04 20:04:49 Of course it will end badly. This is oil. This is the most cyclical of cyclical industries. It has been ending badly for over a century unless there was massive market dominance/collusion…
4910 2018-05-04 20:04:33 Anybody else remember when the "evil oil men" were in office, & we could somehow still afford gas? #goodtimes #p2 #p21 #topprog #Obama2012
4911 2018-05-04 20:04:30 Of course. @DrOz helped turn the BS tide, shilling Loopy Doc's fake 'doctor's note' 2 millions of housewives w/a straight face. Oh +@DrOZ just got called b4 Congress 4 shilling more quackery & snake oil (*Not to b confused w/Jr's hair follicle secretions) #Oily #Slick #BestPeople
4912 2018-05-04 20:04:25 @hungryjanis If you find argan oil too heavy, try marula oil instead. Of all non-fragrant plant oils, marula has one of the lowest molecular weights (absorbs quickly & doesn’t feel greasy)

I also suggest adding retinol every night. Retinol + Vitamin C = no more hyperpigmentation
4913 2018-05-04 20:04:17 OIL DIFF: 5.72 -> 5.61
4914 2018-05-04 20:04:10 EPIC grape juice olive oil victorias secret perfume i love that boy chrom is why henry chewing gum is up my god im not epic..
4915 2018-05-04 20:04:06 Oil better start adding some bodies maybe
4916 2018-05-04 20:03:56 Oh shit I just checked your bio. Seattle. Go to the part store and get some cannabis oil heavy in CBDs.
4917 2018-05-04 20:03:53 Sir, there is a thing called margin. When oil prices go down, tax margin gives additional money to govt which is used for infrastructure projects. When oil prices go up, tax remains the same so margin goes down. Govt tax money doesnt go in anyone's pocket.
4918 2018-05-04 20:03:41 Just curious- how many of you have tried CBD oil ( made from hemp) and how did it work for you? What is working for you now? What isnt? With our diligent research team, we are watching new developments constantly.
4919 2018-05-04 20:03:35 Can oils be mixed together (carrier oils) ? Also can rosehip oil be used on oily skin ? What is the best mixture of oils for oily skin ?
4920 2018-05-04 20:03:34 The amount of CO2, in the air now( 410+)  is at the highest level since the evolution of mankind and Trump/Pruitt are focused on benefiting coal and oil at the expense of clean energy. THIS IS A CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY.        RT if you agree.
4921 2018-05-04 20:03:27 You'd be surprised at how well his snake oil sales pitch works on so many people.
Thankfully, many more see through it.
4922 2018-05-04 20:03:22 Did you try the zaron !! It’s an oil control formula foundation !!
4923 2018-05-04 20:03:18 I lived in Tenom, Sabah for 2 year s (2012-2014) and saw logging trucks taking away huge, ancient trees in a DAILY  basis. Cut down to make way for more palm oil, unchecked destruction. You drive across Sabah and only see palm oil plantations. Pressure for change is needed NOW.
4924 2018-05-04 20:03:14 Fracking is an essential bridge in the advance towards CO2-free energy production. It is undeniable.
The anti-science Luddite faction of environmentalism is as responsible for CO2 emissions as the oil companies are.
4925 2018-05-04 20:03:08 My hip is PISSED at me right now and I'm super tempted to get a gram of CBD oil and eat the whole thing.
4926 2018-05-04 20:03:06 Instructions say "Don't be alarmed by the amount of oil."  Why would anyone be alarmed at that?
4927 2018-05-04 20:02:34 2010 pre war Libya 
Libya’s GDP per capita - $12,120 

2018 - GDP per capita 
Nigeria - $2,177 
South Africa - $5,273  

Libya had a small population & Tons of  oil, so they were far more wealthy per person than those other African countries. Stick to facts
4928 2018-05-04 20:02:23 @UniversityToyot do I have to make an appointment for any services, like an oil change?
4929 2018-05-04 20:02:22 Omfg oil backwards... I'm done.
4930 2018-05-04 20:02:20 For me it's avoiding an itchy rash that keeps me up all night. You can get zinc oxide (non-nano) on Amazon. Mix with lotion or coconut oil. Your skin will be powder white.  There are commercial ones at WF or online.
4931 2018-05-04 20:02:16 I love coconut oil as a natural substitute for almost anything, but I also swear by @Clinique take the day off balm, you should definitely give it a try, very similar texture to coconut oil

4952 2018-05-04 20:00:14 Given approaching financial disruption, China's terrible debt/monetary problems, and Yuan used in 2% of global transactions, perhaps question should be will Oil-RMB-Gold trade reduce USD dominance. Without gold settlement option, PetroYuan would not work IMO. #PetroGold #OOTT
4953 2018-05-04 20:00:11 From Proverbs 27:9 "Oil and perfume make the heart glad, and the sweetness of a friend comes from his earnest counsel."

Of the friendships you made in church as a young person, have you stayed in touch? If so, how have they impacted your life?

BUT While waiting for a coworker to get back with some benadryl, I learned that highly refined peanut oil has no allergens
4958 2018-05-04 19:59:50 LOL my mom’s complaining about her hangover she got from drinkin “some oil” she had at an Omega event last night.

How good and pleasant it is
when God’s people live together in unity!
It is as precious as the anointing oil
that was poured over Aaron.
It is as if the dew of Hermon
were falling on Mount Zion.
For there the Lord bestows his blessing,
even life forevermore.
(Psalm 133)
4961 2018-05-04 19:59:41 Cannabis Oil gave me my life back ...I suffer from chronic headaches and .5ml of oil and they are gone
4962 2018-05-04 19:59:39 We are selling plenty of oil
4963 2018-05-04 19:59:35 Sorry to keep bugging you with oil Atilla, but do you think this is constant manipulation by the Saudis or is this tied to the Iran decision on May 12? Either way, technically and fundamentally, prices should be way way lower. Thank u kind sir.
4964 2018-05-04 19:59:21 A bitch got her oil changed AND a new battery without somebody having to tell me. Growth feels good. 
4965 2018-05-04 19:59:20 There was a time our single voyage charters earned 7 figure nos now mostly 6 or sometimes 5. Pathetic state of the industry. So if oil stays bid I have no fcking complains.
4966 2018-05-04 19:59:18 Awesomeness lady @trish42095 , all I ever see are the Canadian Geese!
4967 2018-05-04 19:59:10 That's not how this works. Security rules apply as long as they're in office. They could be going to an oil wrestling event. Security rules still apply.

4972 2018-05-04 19:57:38 I just realized why I was so drawn to this scent. It reminded me of @westernandrose’s Floral Palms dry oil. When is the big size coming byke? 
4973 2018-05-04 19:57:23 Probably not but most of us know why. Oil and/or the okay for us to install weapons and military personnel on their land.
4974 2018-05-04 19:57:22 Watch out for hot oil sprinkling.

I gave up internet grocery shopping after ordering a 250ml bottle of oil cos it was slightly cheaper that a 1l bottle #problemswithscale
4978 2018-05-04 19:56:28 dt state lacks almost everything, no development, nothing at all n dey ve oil
4979 2018-05-04 19:56:09 someone could have used the wrong immersion oil on the objective/used oil on an air objective previously... usually my first suspect in the shared scope facility I use when something I know should be crisp looks hazy
4980 2018-05-04 19:56:07 Not for me -- I'm training so I dry grilled, no oil, butter, just spices -- not AS yummy, but still great
4981 2018-05-04 19:56:05 I get smoked every time I buy an oil name, it’s incredible 
4982 2018-05-04 19:56:04 THE GOVERNMENT IS TAKING MY CBD OIL AWAY.
4983 2018-05-04 19:55:45 Yeah, wasabi can be offputting if you don't like spicy food. You can ask for sushi without it though, even in Japan. It's also a bit diff from regular spice because it's not oil based, so it doesn't build up over time
4984 2018-05-04 19:55:44 How much does it cost to send oil via truck from Midland, TX,  to Oregon?  Asking for a producer.
4985 2018-05-04 19:55:43 @DJ_SEBAS Every 3x will have its turn. Think about ppl who buy UWT when Oil retreats lol

4989 2018-05-04 19:55:01 Haha what happened to oil? Still tanking?
4990 2018-05-04 19:54:46 I look back and question how I ever used to drink Jager. Shits like drinking alcohol infused crude oil

4992 2018-05-04 19:54:20 The kale is gonna cook way faster than the sweet potato, so either par cook them sweetz or throw the kale in way late into baking. Coat em all in a little olive oil and salt/pepper, bake at 400 for like fifteen minutes and ya should be g2g
4993 2018-05-04 19:54:08 Chop an onion and garlic and tomato then put the garlic and onion in a pan with some olive oil wait for it to get yellowish then add the tomatos which a chiped to small pieces into the pan add some salt and mix it arround then leave it for about 10 mins on low flame

5030 2018-05-04 19:49:21 I understand the impulse. Truly. However, that is an escalation that will not make them change or help you. I think it is forbidden, too. Worst case they will be stalked and threatened back by your fans. That's oil on the flames. It sucks to have to be the better person, I know.
5031 2018-05-04 19:49:20 Simple, pour @1916Gourmet olive oil in the skillet and heat, then place duck breast fat down on high heat for a minute or two then flip and do the same. Then go fat down low heat for 20-30 min then flip, 10 min or so and it should be nice and pink! Slice thinly and voila!

5035 2018-05-04 19:49:00 The Saudi argument would be that higher oil prices mean more stimulus money for business, but if they dipped into their foreign reserves more they could use that. Really, higher oil prices just make the economy appear better
5036 2018-05-04 19:48:58 If there was capacity for our oil (i.e. pipeline) it would be way cheaper. Transcanada.
5037 2018-05-04 19:48:52 Absolutely smothered myself in coconut oil ... I dunno what I’m expecting from it but hope I have a new face tomoz
5038 2018-05-04 19:48:51 I think they're handling it really well, but I'd still lose some faith in Twitter as a company. Tired of companies leaking user information like a sinking oil tanker and not getting penalized in the market...

5040 2018-05-04 19:48:19 Putting beard oil in my beard for some reason makes me feel super confident like I have my shit together. It's so small but it makes more of a difference than I anticipated
5041 2018-05-04 19:48:18 Ya their eating it up , delivered by the greatest American snake oil salesman the world has ever known. Who can .

5045 2018-05-04 19:47:45 This guy at my work uses beard oil every few hours on his face but he doesn’t have any facial hair

Don’t make them drink and drive.
No baby oil!
5047 2018-05-04 19:47:32 We’ve been making our own for years. Coconut oil, shea butter, a little corn starch and essential oils. It works great and leaves your skin baby soft.
5048 2018-05-04 19:47:32 Most interesting John. May presage a greater issue in energy sector. Am thinking #PetroGold / PetroYuan issue, oil running, and Fed's UIG infln @ 3.1% & 12-yr breakout. Much higher energy costs? #OOTT @AndrewBellBNN @LouDobbs @Varneyco @jimiuorio @TruthGundlach @jeffkilburg

5054 2018-05-04 19:46:35 He never considers who he's talking to-he's in TX oil country talking about drilling oil in Alaska-WTF is wrong with this idiot?
5055 2018-05-04 19:46:32 @realDonaldTrump is slower than frozen crude oil.
5056 2018-05-04 19:46:25 Was gonna nap, then thought, I should get my oil changed, car washed, and emissions testing done. 

BEING AN ADULT IS BORING.
5057 2018-05-04 19:46:12 My friend scheduled an oil change, dropped it off, and went back 3 hours later and they didn't even touch his car.
5058 2018-05-04 19:46:06 Yeah, cause the OPEC cartel is aiming for $100 per barrel of crude oil so that they can adequately fund their fiscal needs. We don't have bargaining power in this instance as a country as we are heavily reliant on them to supply us with this scarce resource

5064 2018-05-04 19:45:30 Syria&Ukraine operations are peanuts for RU, estimated ~ $5bn alltogether. Wagner ~ $300mio. PMC's are illegal in RU, Wagner is reportedly paid by "private sponsors", i.e. businessmen who benefit from state procurement and return the favor, + payment by Syria in oil revenue.
5065 2018-05-04 19:45:23 So, uh, has anyone checked on Dennis 'Oil will never go above $44 in my lifetime' Gartman to see if he's room temperature or not?
5066 2018-05-04 19:45:19 Not for oil; trying to check HO & RBOB. Pretty sure RBOB is def. a record there.
5067 2018-05-04 19:45:18 At least he’ll be a Democrat and aware of the actual world around him not just the ones he can bomb and get oil
5068 2018-05-04 19:45:17 im thinking of trying CBD oil - anyone have recs on the best place to get some?

5080 2018-05-04 19:43:33 What I mean is, higher oil prices make the Saudi economy look better because the gov can spend more but until they have a thriving private sector it’s not really any better
5081 2018-05-04 19:43:31 Greed is the reason Govt issues new leases for oil, gas, offshore drilling, & mining on our public lands, monuments, national parks.  Be good stewards of our country’s environment & natural resources. Ban these new leases  @HouseGOP @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @SenateGOP
5082 2018-05-04 19:43:05 Cause people is dumb...someone thought there was construction workers working at like 3am but it was just me and my coworker doing oil changes

5088 2018-05-04 19:42:02 I stocked up on coconut oil, skin on fleek all summer
5089 2018-05-04 19:41:53 Whoooaaa are you using organic extra virgin coconut oil? Cause it does wonders for my hair and skin. BUT everyone is different and some people are allergic.
5090 2018-05-04 19:41:34 I can't PALM OIL be synthesized?
5091 2018-05-04 19:41:25 With no help from you @JustinTrudeau in fact you are driving the oil business out of Canada & importing from Saudi Arabia, a country that stones their women, & has the worst human rights record on the planet earth. I can only hope you are not voted in ever again. #Pathetic
5092 2018-05-04 19:41:23 How did our oil get under their sand ?

They buy our weapons & kill other Muslims, so it’s all good business.

It’s not like it’s our paws  or our heads they are cutting off; just some poor Muslim that realised Mohammad was a nutter & was foolish enough to say so !
5093 2018-05-04 19:41:00 How about a 1:2 THC:CBD oil? I've found that it helps me, the THC gets me to not care about the headache, and the cbd works after the high wears off

5101 2018-05-04 19:39:59 Getting oil changed and the dealership has Ellen on the TV. It is like a subtitled version of the internet from 2 weeks ago.
5102 2018-05-04 19:39:56 So you’re ok with Manafort using Russian money to prop up candidates in the US and Ukraine who will allow Putin to take over the world’s oil supply? There’s no statute of limitations on treason!
5103 2018-05-04 19:39:36 That’s ok they will directly affect Russian oil prices ... competition

5113 2018-05-04 19:38:14 I think the #immigrants think they are using old oil tankers to migrate to #America
5114 2018-05-04 19:38:02 How was your day? Well I was on the forklift carrying a full skid of oil dry down a hill. The brakes went out on the fork lift. My day went downhill from there
5115 2018-05-04 19:37:46 We have an abundance of fresh greens and vegetable in BC.  Not only can we pick from our gardens, we can forage in our local fields for nettles and fiddleheads.

5116 2018-05-04 19:37:36 Iridescent. It makes me think of this crystal and stained glass light catcher in the window at my parents house, blowing giant bubbles in the summer time, and oil slicks on the road after it rains.
5117 2018-05-04 19:37:29 Higher oil prices may SLOW reform, and this is not good for the long term future of the country or the region.

5122 2018-05-04 19:36:10 Well, sorry about the cancer. You got any CBD oil? I have 2 drops in the morning, 2 in the evening. Full spectrum, 3000mg. You gotta warm the bottle in warm water (less than 65’C otherwise it damages the actives inside) because 3000mg is very viscous.
5123 2018-05-04 19:36:09 what if nagnude sunbathing ka tapos yung darker areas ng body mo nakasunblock/covered tapos yung darker areas may tanning oil/exposed?

5127 2018-05-04 19:35:40 The higher $USD hasn't done anything to lower the price of #oil although one could argue, price would be at $80 if not for the higher $USD.
5128 2018-05-04 19:35:39 Good point. They're so cannabigoted in Idaho they had to reject twice a CBD oil law that Utah pioneered. "Idaho is what America was" has never been so true as it is lately.
5129 2018-05-04 19:35:19 Make a marinade of olive oil, fresh lemon juice and garlic. Can throw some parsley in there too. Or orange juice. Let the chicken soak in it overnight. Grilling is best.

5137 2018-05-04 19:34:21 Interesting. I wonder if he’s not seeing a supply side oil price shock (which we now have, and which is worsening) dampening demand, like the 70s. Unbelievable. This can’t last.

5145 2018-05-04 19:32:59 But will higher oil prices really help the Saudi economy? Oil money funds the budget & the gov is the biggest employer, so when the gov is issuing contracts & building stuff Saudi econ data look better but that doesn’t mean the economy is healthy.

Kindly note that having the means to help doesn't make you the lord and master of a 'helpee'.  It just means you care enough to be concerned. 

We can't eat yam and oil and rub it all over our faces and clothes.  It's a principle.

The nose is closely related to your circulatory system, so if you're breaking out on your nose it might indicate a blood pressure issue. Increase the amounts of essential fatty acids in your diet such as avocado and oil but avoid alcohol and coffee.

5314 2018-05-04 19:09:09 to double cleanse, use ANY cleansing oil or balm on a dry face. massage over your face (even with makeup on) for about a minute. then, rinse. your skin should have little to no makeup residue.
5315 2018-05-04 19:09:03 @realDonaldTrump These oil prices are getting out of hand. Over $3 a gallon for no reason. Something needs to be done.

5317 2018-05-04 19:09:01 I have finally found a solution to the bumps I get after shaving my bikini area. I stopped waxing too because the bumps were worse. For 5 months now, I’d apply coconut oil before applying shaving cream then immediately apply coconut oil afterwards. The wonders! You should try it.

5449 2018-05-04 18:52:15 Shades, what most of us call washes, are a fast way to create a blended effect with less effort. They're the same thing as Nuln Oil.

Shades are great. I use them all the time. Some tasks require more precision though, and that's where blending comes in.

5453 2018-05-04 18:51:21 The US refiners are more flexible than European and Asian refineries. Move between gasoline and heating oil seasons in US. Although the change is relatively small it is greater than European and Asian
5454 2018-05-04 18:51:13 Please explain what the Saudi people will do once the oil runs out. Trillions of dollars have been squandered on weapons, ostentation and profligacy that could have been used to build infrastructure for industry and commerce to benefit all citizens. It's a huge lost opportunity.

5473 2018-05-04 18:49:23 Batteries don’t disrupt oil; they move the point of oil consumption upstream, where it’s more efficient—and yes, subject to more competition. But nothing about batteries fulfills the criterion for low- or high-end disruption, per Disruption Theory, vis-a-vis oil.

5478 2018-05-04 18:49:14 You nailed it Greg. Whether it’s mining, oil and gas, forestry, wind farms, aquaculture and more, Canada is sidelining itself to the advantage of poorly managed producers. Totally wrongheaded.

5481 2018-05-04 18:49:05 We need to use our oil researers  to drive oil down as that will drive our economy.  The oil companies' profits need to be controlled also and we need to invest in a new cheap energy source.

5483 2018-05-04 18:48:57 I would like to point out to you. That being conservative as far as the environment aren’t conservative (republican issues) anymore. It’s become a liberal issue. It’s sad to see that the conservatives only pay lip service on this. They’d rather drill for oil and gas.
5484 2018-05-04 18:48:51 What is there to "defend" about Maduro? Dude single-handedly ran a prosperous nation into the ground.

5588 2018-05-04 18:36:45 If ur system has 300 ;point stops, wat else do u expect.
This is the reason I STRONGLY believe that RETAIL is almost always under capitalized
Option selling strategy snake oil vendors do not tell clients the minimum funding required to carry out 3% per month assured returns
5589 2018-05-04 18:36:38 Oil prices rose about 2% on Friday with U.S. crude hitting its highest in more than three years as global supplies remained tight and the market awaited news from Washington on possible new U.S. sanctions against Iran.
5590 2018-05-04 18:36:30 do you see them going any lower with where the oil and market is atm
5591 2018-05-04 18:36:25 I'd say would depend on the hobbies in question. If I speak for myself: When I build models I use power tools and an air compressor for the airbrush, which are noisy, Oil painting and self loading cartridges are messy and smelly.  My old girlfriend made ceramics (messy) and wrote
5592 2018-05-04 18:36:09 for real though like no becky i’m not here to try and steal your dad’s job at his billion dollar oil company, i just want my degree and friends thanks bye
5593 2018-05-04 18:36:08 For Baptism we use water and Chrism. The Chrism must contain cannabis balsam (hashish) dissolved in olive oil, but no, one cannot use beer.
5594 2018-05-04 18:35:59 Ta, I love it  Is lavender oil any use if it’s 24 hours after sustaining the burn?
5595 2018-05-04 18:35:54 How about my oil call from KashCycle2!

5597 2018-05-04 18:35:44 O
As an snp devotee you've shown your true colours. Your party has divided a nation with childish petty rhetoric. I feel sorry 4 any rape victim who comes upon you as you've not considered their plight. As for made up stuff let's start with oil,  dealings with China etc
5598 2018-05-04 18:35:38 The next global narrative will be how do we reduce oil consumption, to accommodate supply.  A ways off yet, but the globe has some tough slogging to do before they get the taps back to flowing.
5599 2018-05-04 18:35:20 Type 1 certainly has its own challnges. If youre already not eating refined sugars on type one I would be pushing for removal of industrial seed oils (canola, cottenseed, corn oil ect) grains (other than rice), & artificial/exotic food additives (sweeteners, preservatives, ect)
5600 2018-05-04 18:35:15 Being a responsible adult and throwing money at vehicle registration renewal, oil change etc
5601 2018-05-04 18:35:12 Hey, can I have some oil, dis bitch is thirsty
5602 2018-05-04 18:35:08 Got it...just saw the one tweet and thought I'd ask 
5603 2018-05-04 18:35:05 I want to straighten it but I don’t. I just put coconut oil in it & put it up in an ponytail
5604 2018-05-04 18:35:02 No.
5605 2018-05-04 18:34:58 I am legit sweating tanning oil
5606 2018-05-04 18:34:55 I'm shirtless and covered in coconut oil at 76's cookout right now. Pass the bbq sauce
5607 2018-05-04 18:34:39 Greene’s has been providing reliable well testing services to the oil and gas industry for decades.
5608 2018-05-04 18:34:31 Just found out apricot oil is anti inflammatory. Rub me down.
5609 2018-05-04 18:34:21 We don’t mock giving to charity.
The church isn’t a charity.
It is a business that has made a fuckton of money by selling snake oil.
And tax free.
It’s a great business model. Just ask the scientologists
5610 2018-05-04 18:34:18 Getting my oil changed and it’s taking forever 
5611 2018-05-04 18:34:16 Shoutout to the gray Honda leaking oil in the rain I just broke my tailbone in the middle of the parking lot
5612 2018-05-04 18:34:16 The place we go to up in the mountains, the guy has a huge dish, glug of olive oil, layer of spuds, wild herbs, chunks of lamb or kid goat, more oil, layer of spuds, some slices of lemon etc etc, lid on, into an outside wood fired oven for hours.
Looks like he chops

5616 2018-05-04 18:32:59 Wikipedia: "There are no known accounts of snake oil peddled in the United States or Europe containing any trace of actual snake extract."

Similarly, there are no known accounts of blockchain peddled in the United States or Europe containing any trace of actual blockchain.

5618 2018-05-04 18:32:46 Rosehip oil and vitamin e oil are good too!!!
5619 2018-05-04 18:32:44 Bruh I've been waiting for 3 hours for an oil change. What is going on
5620 2018-05-04 18:32:38 She’s not breaking anything. The Liar in Chief is responsible for all the troubles he’s created for himself. Wake up. 

Be a Republican. Be a conservative. Fine. But don’t sell your soul to a lying snake oil salesman. He is a fraud. Genuinely, I’m sorry you support him.

5622 2018-05-04 18:32:26 Would Rickey be close or did he simply have too much time elsewhere to qualify?
5623 2018-05-04 18:32:24 Pepboys 20 for an oil change I believe
5624 2018-05-04 18:32:12 @whotfcares_ We hear you! When was the last time you get the oil change done?
5625 2018-05-04 18:32:05 OMG GIRLLL go to autozone or something and ask what oil you should use for your car.  you HAVE to add oil!
5626 2018-05-04 18:31:56 My followers know that I have been promoting Oil Stocks for over 6 months or so, if you listened to my advice, Kudos to you...I know we are going to pay more pennies at the Pump...but.....
5627 2018-05-04 18:31:55 pov bj's are my thing lately.. ones where it looks like the girl is really there right in front of you.  deepthroating, facefucking, pussy closeups with lots of detail.. HD.. i like seeing anal and cumshots too. some of the massage clips are nice.  oil.
5628 2018-05-04 18:31:30 The installed capacity at the end of Musharraf’s time was 21,000 MW. How much is it now? The reason for large scale load shedding at Zardari’s time was the high price of oil and shortage of gas. Importing RLNG enabled recommissioning of closed units and reduction in outages

5632 2018-05-04 18:31:24 We just passed one in California for gods sakes!!!! And the GOP and oil industry are already trying to repeal it. Where’s the Illinois version?

But as long as Grover owns DC, there’s no hope for a federal gas tax.
5633 2018-05-04 18:31:17 Going to the UCP AGM today. We conservatives are fighting for Alberta, Canada, Oil and pipelines and the NDP are fighting against everything Alberta stands for. Cmon 2019

5637 2018-05-04 18:30:31 Migraines yes and I’ve found the best way to cure them is a dark hot bath with a towel on your head and put some lavender or eucalyptus oil in the bath and smoke you a fatty
5638 2018-05-04 18:30:30 AKA & Burna Boy = Yam  and Palm oil.

5641 2018-05-04 18:30:18 Yes. We have crude oil as well as lots of natural gas production here. Based on many reports about Venezuelan gov't. operations, even with dirty oil, a well-run gov't. & economy could thrive. Maduro & friends just don't know how to run a gov't.
5642 2018-05-04 18:30:12 At least we can all agree that Obama was a real President and Trump is a snake oil salesman.

5652 2018-05-04 18:28:52 Were you there?  Does your car insurance company pay small claims rather than go to court?  Just to oil the squeaky wheel?  I don’t know what happened, but her behavior now, and what her daughter and this son is enduring is shameful. She wants money. Soros $$.  Idk
5653 2018-05-04 18:28:50 People pray for cake...but when God gives them eggs, oil, butter, batter, a pan, & an oven, they get frustrated & leave the kitchen.
5654 2018-05-04 18:28:45 Me: *drops off the car at the mechanic's to get an oil change*

5656 2018-05-04 18:28:38 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
5657 2018-05-04 18:28:38 If McDavid hadn’t taken that penalty we probably could have won the game so thanks for that, you big dumb oil spill.
5658 2018-05-04 18:28:35 Just had tiff oil my scalp omg I feel soooo much better !
5659 2018-05-04 18:28:17 3 things:

1. Earnings strong. 
2. Jobs remains firm and tight. 
3. Rates & Oil stabilizes.
5660 2018-05-04 18:28:16 Yes, that’s very true, but oil prices have been down for a while and the cost at the pump doesn’t reflect that. Can’t blame it all on taxes or temporary supply issues.
5661 2018-05-04 18:27:59 Right now I have a whole rainbow trout in the oven covered in olive oil slowly cooking at 80 degrees Celsius, that will be lunch tommorow.  For dinner this weekend I have a holstein beef roast in there as well.  72 hours should suffice
5662 2018-05-04 18:27:56 Oil rocking higher as mentioned for members , keep eye on $FTK oil over 4+ can run

5669 2018-05-04 18:27:14 Yeeeess yea Just a lil more oil in ma lamp keep it burning 
5670 2018-05-04 18:27:09 Mum got me chicken nuggets at the chippy but I think they’ve been cooked in the same oil as the fish 
5671 2018-05-04 18:26:56 My sister and I just got into a severe brawl about an hour ago, I hit her in head with my beach bag which had nail polish, tanning oil, cuticle cutter mad shit lmao (was painting my toes yesterday on the roof but anyways)
5672 2018-05-04 18:26:52 I'm also not interested in creating shareholder value for oil companies and their sycophants. I am concerned, however, with the welfare of my descendants (and yours) a few generations in the future. Hence our differing views on things.
5673 2018-05-04 18:26:41 See you this weekend
5674 2018-05-04 18:26:24 Double was for 8 years ago! Sanctions brought Iran to the table of negotiations! And about influence I believe you are underestimating China and Russia’s influence on Iran’s economy and military status. About selling oil, the era of Babak Zanjanism is over.
5675 2018-05-04 18:26:24 Wondering if Dolly needs Bengay, murphys oil soap or something else for those joints??? 
5676 2018-05-04 18:26:23 With just the slightest drizzle of olive oil to top it off

5687 2018-05-04 18:25:18 I had been a fan of Amitabh Bachch since some years ago ,but he did not performed any remarkable role since last decade, which could be a milestone in the field of acting. moreover he spoiled his reputation by accepting Ad. like champi tail malish {nav ratan oil },boroplus etc.
5688 2018-05-04 18:25:00 CBD oil is a great medicine, and now can be obtained legally in all 50 states. It is not a "cure all" for pain, but research shows that it potentiates opioids. Try Green Roads Wellness or Mary's Medicinals as good sources of CBD - both of which do mail order.
5689 2018-05-04 18:24:57 Me too  (and liquid coconut oil season!). when we going to Palm Springs to make this a reality?

5709 2018-05-04 18:21:26 Crude oil (and distillates) are traded in USD. The dollar has been weaker against the Euro. Anticipation of US Summer demand and Iran deal going kaput.
5710 2018-05-04 18:21:15 Venezuela has largest oil reserves in world with one absolutely bad draw back.
There oil is extremely dirty and requires a lot of refinement and this is costly.
When oil was above 90+/ barrel they were doing great in wealth.
5711 2018-05-04 18:21:15 Unfortunately Mr. Trudeau is too busy with the oil industry lobbying to bother about the handicapped citizens lobbying him. Nice guy but like the Notley all about the appearances and not the actual doing of the legislation that will ensure handicapped rights guaranteed. Sad.
5712 2018-05-04 18:21:07 BS. We do plenty of refining here. We import crude oil. And Russia, KSA & UAE are Obama’s buddies rather than Trumps. Sure.

5728 2018-05-04 18:19:12 hye oil please, it crossed what you thought is resistance, what from here
5729 2018-05-04 18:19:11 If only #Nigeria could focus on getting more investments in from the #Oil majors, we could double production and enjoy the high prices in the face of production declines in Venezuela, Algeria, etc. But the narration of "Oil is not the future" was sold and bought.
5730 2018-05-04 18:19:10 I would love to #Win this for ....b-OIL-utiful hair. Thanks  #FreebieFriday xxx
5731 2018-05-04 18:19:01 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?
5732 2018-05-04 18:18:55 Yes well done. Some of us just happen to agree more with the Kremlin on this, than with all the jihadi-loving media in the west funded by arms dealers and oil corps.
5733 2018-05-04 18:18:52 Girls our in the garden trying to start our petrol lawn mower so they can cut the grass... "Mark we need your manpower, the lawn mower won't start" 

"Is there petrol in it?"

"Yes I just filled it up" *points at cap on lawn mower

5735 2018-05-04 18:18:39 Best  CPD oil? Pure?
5736 2018-05-04 18:18:33 Frankincense is definitely an acquired taste in my essential oil world experience, but I’ve grown to like and benefit from it.

5739 2018-05-04 18:18:27 Ya, it’s pretty bad.  I’m procrastinating it now by plopping coconut oil in my hair
5740 2018-05-04 18:18:26 I noticed he popped up on #BPC as I checked it to see who was actually buying the spike - talking about a $4bn oil refinery being built in the Bahamas and a "supermajor" farming in. Outright lies posted every minute.
5741 2018-05-04 18:18:20 I doubt that is the reason.  The US has been supporting this war since the Obama era.  It is all for oil.  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain by doing what made America great.  Stay out of the foreign affairs of all but our TRUE allies.
5742 2018-05-04 18:18:17 Very soon. Like today. Don’t let that engine lock up cuz the oil is all gone.
5743 2018-05-04 18:18:04 The economy expands or shrinks :more oil more debt
5744 2018-05-04 18:17:58 Kylie Jenner’s ramen is a joke. Obviously she hasn’t tried the (imported?) Asian ramen brands you find in Asian grocery stores. 

Depending on the brand there is a seasoning oil packet with something similar to butter and garlic. Or some other delicious sauce.
5745 2018-05-04 18:17:40 My oil maintenance light been on in my car for like a week. When do I actually HAVE TO take it in? (I know close to nothing about cars clearly)

5748 2018-05-04 18:17:16 Could you explain what makes the Saudi Royal Family 'royal' in the 21st century? I mean, where are their wizards, unicorns and dragons? Instead of squandering the country's oil wealth on weapons and prostitutes a legitimate government would be building a future for the people.
5749 2018-05-04 18:17:06 Oil is up huge and $MXC is now up 33%. $GBR is next IMO... we can see 1.60+
5750 2018-05-04 18:16:36 Within touching distance of knocking out MI & make the world a better place did Aunt Nita from her privileged boundary side mansion offer KXIP personnel permanent emplymnt at one of her oil refineries in exchange for a free pass. Whr are Mudgals & Lodhas when we actually need thm
5751 2018-05-04 18:16:29 $GBR this could blow up on oil momentum. $MXC is already up 33% @ACInvestorBlog @TradeOnTheWire1
5752 2018-05-04 18:15:56 Actually, so many experts say Iran will find buyers easily & get oil thru Iraq,Turkey, where ever, but this idea way less believed than the price bullish NARRATIVE.

-nat’l debt is a made-up crisis
-*your* party is in love with military funding
-Justin already did a Star Wars meme
-the plucky rebels in this country are labour, environmental, and Indigenous activists, not the oil junkies
5760 2018-05-04 18:14:49 My hair was really dry until I started using harvested natural oils from the heads of other people in it and now it’s very soft and it’s awesome. Miles better than coconut oil.
5761 2018-05-04 18:14:33 For FX gelatin you're already mixing in another oil though (glycerin derived from oils.) In theory it wasn't unreasonable for them to work.
5762 2018-05-04 18:14:05 Ah, 1973 @realDonaldTrump The year the stock market crashed and oil spiked helping kick off a deep recession starting in Nov. The same month Nixon gave his "I am not a crook speech." Five months later came the subpoena.
5763 2018-05-04 18:14:01 my boss cancelled on me so i did a mani/pedi, wrapped my feet in bags of oil, and now i'm drinking champagne and watching jem & the holograms and lesbian porn for research for a new project. luv my life
5764 2018-05-04 18:13:58 The littlest things mean the most to mums, a little set of bath bomb/oil with mini candles, a handbag or purse and a necklace will do 
5765 2018-05-04 18:13:54 It's gorgeous nice curls. Argan oil &aloe vera will make your growth sprout bountiful.
5766 2018-05-04 18:13:50 Define "serious."

And then can you get the automakers and oil industry and GOP congressional committee to end their effort to repeal California's new gas tax? Because they're coming after it with a vengeance.

5768 2018-05-04 18:13:37 It's the oil change that will make the eyes water
5769 2018-05-04 18:13:32 WTI #Oil clearly pricing in a #Trump #Bolton pullout of the agreement. A pullout likely leads to geopolitical uncertainty and potential economic fallout. Supply concerns can push oil higher, but alternatively global 'demand destruction' can push oil prices much lower in the end.
5770 2018-05-04 18:13:03 Sitting in waiting area, listening to oil change mechanics talk about how crappy our car is.  Don't I know it.  #POSCar
5771 2018-05-04 18:13:02 yeah oil and "water" not a good mix, I've never tried oils
5772 2018-05-04 18:12:38 Also, don't know if they still do but Burger King fried their veggie burgers in the same oil as the fish.
5773 2018-05-04 18:12:30 في فترة مفاوضات مبادرة الغاز السعودية (ماتت لاحقاً)، صدر قرار بإسناد تقييم العروض التقنية الاستثمارية إلى لجنة من قيادات أرامكو، صحيفة Oil Weekly شبهت القرار بأنه كإحالة إدارة حظيرة دجاج لمجموعة من الثعالب..
5774 2018-05-04 18:12:25 Bro I’ve been in here for like almost 2 hours for a damn oil change I’m hot fr fr
5775 2018-05-04 18:12:12 Government control is bad. Sure. And what about corporation censorship? Can you guys talk about the water crisis on Flint? Can you guys talk about oil spills from pipelines inside the US polluting important rivers???

5777 2018-05-04 18:11:57 I've used all sorts as well, I just thought I was out of acrylics and someone online suggested doing oil paints for the strong pigment. Unfortunately the oil paints kept sinking to the bottom of my gelatin mixture and basically just separated like a nightmare.
5778 2018-05-04 18:11:57 #ha214 Claude Monet is beloved for his series of oil paintings depicting water lilies, serene gardens, and Japanese footbridges. The French painter manipulated light and shadow to portray landscapes in a groundbreaking way
5779 2018-05-04 18:11:33 I’ve just picked out some of the shares the top fund managers have and bought them. Burberry, Sage, Diageo, Unilever. Bought BP and Shell  due to the oil price going up etc. I haven’t done it yet but I also think putting stop losses is advisable.
5780 2018-05-04 18:11:33 whens ramadan this year? i need to know so i can go asda and kop the 70% off atta and oil
5781 2018-05-04 18:11:32 I thought I needed to run and find somebody to love but all I needed was some coconut oil
5782 2018-05-04 18:11:24 Overdue creating some fake enemy in the Middle East somewhere so we can make up an excuse to go to war and chore their oil 
5783 2018-05-04 18:11:17 Con o senza "oil oggetto vasellina"
5784 2018-05-04 18:11:15 No oil. If you can prove you’re over I think 1/4 American Indian- depending on the tribe you have rights to any money that’s made from your native land. If they found any oil on that land u should be getting checks. I know people that do.
5785 2018-05-04 18:11:12 @iamdbanj does your hair smell like hot oil
5786 2018-05-04 18:11:08 I like it to rinse through my hair once a week when I don't just use tap water, mix it with olive oil 50/50 for furniture polish, drink it straight to stave off appetite, clean my vegetables from market with dilution, discourage ants around sink with a quick wipe, cure tinea.
5787 2018-05-04 18:11:03 Oil pipelines only benifit the rich.

5789 2018-05-04 18:11:00 sad shit that ion wanna go get this oil change by myself
5790 2018-05-04 18:10:57 some youtube cooking people recommended to let the oil warm up before putting the corns in and yeah lol never doing that again
5791 2018-05-04 18:10:49 Oil change boutta make me late
5792 2018-05-04 18:10:40 Going to the car dealer is a scam. After these free oil changes I need to find me a little bootleg mechanic
5793 2018-05-04 18:10:32 That looks fine to me. It’s a two stroke, so plug colour is quite dependent on how much oil is sloshed in.
5794 2018-05-04 18:10:28 All I wanted was an oil change and the inspection/emissions done. Shocks, tires, alignment. This bitch better run like butter for $500 
5795 2018-05-04 18:10:22 The one that pisses me off the most is the dumb ass that don't know what a lug wrench is. At the age of 10 my dad taught me how to change oil, change a tire, & change out brake pads. I was not going to be at the mercy of anyone once I started driving at 15.

5797 2018-05-04 18:10:20 I fell for it at one time. Misinformation some of   the preachers are preaching Christian Zionism they don’t even know what it means. They know that Israel is mentioned in the Bible o/t and N/T. The Jerusalem of the Bible was not @ oil and Iran. Politics~

5804 2018-05-04 18:09:54 i just got my oil changed, car washed, and tires rotated for 40 fucking dollars wow happy friday
5805 2018-05-04 18:09:43 Never mind the climate change thing, or the reduction in destructive mining techniques for coal & oil.
5806 2018-05-04 18:09:31 On the crimes. And enough in the public domain to conclude them. Lying to our face on Stormy payments.

But that doesn't change .... hate, demeaning us all, enabling immorality, lying constantly, cheating to get tax $, national parks raped for Russian oil.
5807 2018-05-04 18:09:30 Wow 17 whole tweets you’re really lighten up the midnight oil aren’t you buddy
5808 2018-05-04 18:09:24 Here's where a gun would handy. Or boiling oil.....
5809 2018-05-04 18:09:16 Secondly both MPs from PTI Gul sahib khan and Malik Qasim, they disappointed  they ppls of karak,we produce billions of rupees oil and gas  but we are still living in karbal, there is no drinking water  we still bringwater  through donkeys
5810 2018-05-04 18:08:48 According to their website the veggie burger doesn’t contain any animal products  but due to filtration in some branches it may come into contact with oil used for cooking meat??? So the actual burger should be vegan but not after being cooked! Good work,McDonald’s 
5811 2018-05-04 18:08:41 but higher prices are still a boomerang for OPEC members. Shale oil will take advantage of higher prices undermining OPEC cuts
5812 2018-05-04 18:08:37 I think the DeMark traders will finally stop looking at oil after this week.  She took on a 6M barrel build and roofed it.  #oil #energy #aramco #saudijazzfest
5813 2018-05-04 18:08:35 Wait you need oil to cook a steak? I’ve been only using butter....
5814 2018-05-04 18:08:02 Actually mine comes close. I'm not saying a have a theater popcorn printer or anything but I cook over stovetop in butter and oil and lacquer it with movie theater butter, shake, and kazaam. But such a hassle!
5815 2018-05-04 18:07:57 If in doubt as to my submission on #Oil, please feel free to call oil industry operators in Nigeria. You all in the NASS don't have a background in several fields critical to the national economy and therefore need to organise sessions for education.
5816 2018-05-04 18:07:41 Oil is just getting tired at this point.. can’t break that ceiling..
5817 2018-05-04 18:07:41 Green tea, blackberry cobbler, and rosemary olive oil for the savory option! 
5818 2018-05-04 18:07:28 Getting my oil changed, sitting in the waiting room, some old guy is here with me....asleep....snoring....boi be having a GOOD sleep.
5819 2018-05-04 18:07:13 1875: Jan 1 of this year Jacob Schiff, now Solomon Loeb’s  son-in-law after marrying his daughter, Teresa, takes control of the banking house, Kuhn, Loeb & Co. He goes on to finance John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Company,  Harriman’s Railroad Empire, & Carnegie’s Steel Empire
5820 2018-05-04 18:06:58 I feel like I'm in a bizzaro version of the USA. Everyone went to extremes.  The right trusts a snake oil salesman with our country and the Left is worried about feelings and safe spaces.

5824 2018-05-04 18:06:36 Premier Lurch wants to drill for oil in federally mandated marine protected areas. Will anyone stand up to corporations and side with the environment for once? Or are we all just doomed?
5825 2018-05-04 18:06:21 Anyone else’s coconut oil liquify overnight? Asking for a friend
5826 2018-05-04 18:06:07 Okay oya oil your body for me. You’ll need like one gallon of oil o. 25 liters
5827 2018-05-04 18:06:06 Unless the oil industry get involved with the space program. Haha haha

Then we're screwed on the future too

5832 2018-05-04 18:05:49 What you law makers and political leaders should be doing is to call for more investments into #Oil, particularly into technologies such as EOR and IOR. Enough time has been wasted, Nigeria can double production from existing operators.
5833 2018-05-04 18:05:33 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
5834 2018-05-04 18:05:24 Yikes !  "Guetemalans at the boarder !" Whale oil beef hooked.
5835 2018-05-04 18:05:22 Taking profit on $BTE & buying $RRX when it was at the lows wasn't looking like the best idea with the strength in Baytex recently. Seems low NatGas and WCS prices have hurt earnings and the best way to profit right now may very well be to seek pure light-med oil plays like $RRX.
5836 2018-05-04 18:05:04 Real talk: Oil and gas will continue to employ less Canadians as companies find new ways to cut costs. We can't allow people and communities to become "stranded assets"!! #Justtransition
5837 2018-05-04 18:04:55 Name 5 things you use daily that didn’t come from oil progress? Having a balanced approach to oil production is facile? jmj does it really have to be all or nothing with you enviro wack jobs?

5840 2018-05-04 18:04:12 Where is your coverage of the price of oil and how it affects the state economy?  Why is #akleg planning to steal our $$ with oil at +70 per barrel? SB21 is a FAILURE & violation of our state constitution-Just cause Trump calls u fake news doesn't mean you have to prove him right
5841 2018-05-04 18:04:07 VCR is still busted. Bought a bunch of #wresslemania tapes and hafta go to Mr tire and act like I'm gettin a oil change to sit down and use there TV/ vcr combo. I usually get kicked out after I #shart myself and stew in it for a few hours and they realize I'm not a custumer
5842 2018-05-04 18:04:06 Despite the development of alternative energy to #oil (electric cars, solar, wind, etc.), the world population is growing at a high rate and by-products of oil will remain in demand.

5850 2018-05-04 18:02:17 There is still about 60-70% oil left after secondary recovery.  There is advancement in technology, we now have Enhanced Oil Recovery methods fast developing, which means it could be cheaper to bring oil out from existing wells. So Nigeria is not going to run out of #Oil!
5851 2018-05-04 18:02:10 Tomato sauce for pasta: olive oil, onion, fry until clear. Garlic, fresh (cherry) tomatoes, low heat until wet. Balsamic vinegar, fresh thyme, salt, pepper, cook until tomatoes have called apart. Apply to pasta.
5852 2018-05-04 18:01:42 - Uses fear instead of facts to get what they want
- The government won't fund research on gun violence because of NRA lobbying

TL;DR: The leadership is morally corrupt & uses money to get their way, regardless of what the people want, similar to big pharma, big oil, banks, etc

5864 2018-05-04 18:00:05 My grapefruit essential oil for my diffuser came in the mail today. Will never, ever understand why I love the smell of grapefruit but abhor the taste.
5865 2018-05-04 17:59:58 Making my first batch of Comfrey oil. I plan to use it on EDS bruising and dislocations. It’s really good for your skin too so I may as some to my body soap.
5866 2018-05-04 17:59:50 I’m a thot for avocados and olive oil

5869 2018-05-04 17:59:35 I gotta scoop more of this coconut milk / oil mixture from ogx.  My hair loves this sh_t
5870 2018-05-04 17:59:29 Excellent show with #Jo. Started with her very sexy black legging on, jacket & black heels & finished all naked with oil on boobs :) In between, Jo did ride Mr Huge, & had fun. Red joined at the end for a quickie (mainly doggy position) @joliejo82 1/2
5871 2018-05-04 17:59:13 90 seconds if she talks dirty to him about chemical disposal in rivers and baby ducks drowning in oil 60 seconds if he’s watching DeepWater Horizon footage too.
5872 2018-05-04 17:59:06 If it's a stye, use coconut oil. My husband just got a stye last week. Looked just like that. I rubbed coconut oil on the eye, and he rinsed it off. Only needed to do it twice and it was gone. Also, my son had a blocked tear duct when he was younger, rubbed it on it as well.
5873 2018-05-04 17:58:58 people have been asking me how I've been getting good color lately and honestly I walk around coated in coconut oil all day so I'm just baking under the sun
5874 2018-05-04 17:58:45 Remember every player has thier own constituents, thier own goals, but Puerto Rico ask yourself what that oil revenue could do for you individually as a dividend check.
5875 2018-05-04 17:58:40 Shout out to the guy who told me yesterday that oil going higher was bearish for the market.

5881 2018-05-04 17:58:10 I have watched this discussion on #oil not being relevant in the future of #Nigeria. Some even hold that Nigeria's oil will run out. It's all not true. Note you heard it here first.
5882 2018-05-04 17:57:54 @TomiLahren how to change oil: (1) chock wheels; (2) put large container under oil pan; (3) undo bolt and let oil drain into container; (4) put in new oil; (5) find oil filter and change it; (6) dispose of old oil; (7) I'm single and available, hee-hee.
5883 2018-05-04 17:57:41 Bulgaria was (is) well known top exporter of rose oil, while   were meant as decortative plants. It was in 1855, when two youngsters - Soupert and Notting, creators of >350 new rose varieties, kicked off what was to become a mania after the Great London Exhibition of 1862.
5884 2018-05-04 17:57:36 Someone put oil in my gas tank trying to sabotage my car 
Whoever you are who did this i hope the universe puts you in my way ima fuck u up
5885 2018-05-04 17:57:23 How do you divide the oil money? That's the real issue.  Every other thing is rhetorics

He'd be rolling along frowning and shaking his head, thinking of all the roads in the Realms he'd have to improve, just to use a rig. Then the oil wells and refineries to get the fuel...ruination. Magic carpet fleet =easier.
5891 2018-05-04 17:56:46 It seems like everyone is coming to get their oil changed today  guys chill out I’m tryna be lazy
5892 2018-05-04 17:56:40 Five or six years of cheap oil and now you only can afford "dozens" of supporters. Sad.
5893 2018-05-04 17:56:39 Theyve discontinued it together with the aftersun face balm. Only solaire face oil left now 
5894 2018-05-04 17:56:30 Slightly disingenuous. This would mean all oil fueled cars, not just hybrids.

5902 2018-05-04 17:55:12 I havent been silent but my govt backed the White Helmets! Another TERRORIST GROUP! It is a fight for oil and money and both sides are horrific! How do you propose I fight these warmongers? I call them out! But I am one person in a world filled w violence. I do the best I can.
5903 2018-05-04 17:55:04 Now the American people need yo see the Gas prices lowered, we are being held hostage by the oil traders, and big oul companies, all for their profit. There is no shortage if oil, none
5904 2018-05-04 17:55:01 FWIW she also said that Canadian companies are mining and drilling and the moment they hit a decent oil reserve she expects the debate to escalate dramatically.
5905 2018-05-04 17:54:58 Any number of oil producing nation's could help develop and bring us up to speed. May I suggest putting buy out clauses in those agreements and specific numbers from the onset.
5906 2018-05-04 17:54:57 Shout out to me for trying to be a "man" and changing my oil only to realize I drained my transmission fluid and not my oil 
5907 2018-05-04 17:54:55 Talk about Politics and pandering in an effort to enable #akleg  who needs to fix SB21, not steal more from us. Oil is +70 per barrel #akleg & fake news still pretend oil prices have caused the problem. SB21 is the problem. Fake news enables theft from the poor-SHAME!

5912 2018-05-04 17:54:38 Remember oil over $100 years ago and the CONgressional hearings about the evil speculators?  Yeah, its the opposite for equities.  Up equities = good (ie. look the other way... who cares how we get there... blah blah blah)
5913 2018-05-04 17:54:37 country is ruled by a royal family of religious extremists (wahabist sunnis) who are able to hold power because they control the vast oil wealth. that wealth allows them to build sleek, modern cities. that also allows them to crack down on political dissent.
5914 2018-05-04 17:54:36 Getting an Oil Change, but I forgot my headphones. So I guess I'll just be putting some time into Pokemon Crystal in silence.
5915 2018-05-04 17:54:33 Everyone knows that all Russians are opposed to oil drilling including their government. Especially, dare I say it, Putin

5918 2018-05-04 17:54:16 I wondered how long it would take for that facile argument to show up. Stopping oil activity IS the eventual solution, and working to replace fossil fuels is how we get there. Being pro-environment isn't being anti-progress; being pro-oil definitely is.

5925 2018-05-04 17:53:08 Tell us why gas prices are skyrocketing, it's a manipulation of the market by Wall Street investors, gasoline companies. Once again we are held hostage by the oil traders and their demand for profits.  It is all bullshit
5926 2018-05-04 17:52:59 Oil sands not tar sands. Oil is not made from tar. You seem to need the info.

5930 2018-05-04 17:52:37 Pak is central figure of BRI. - No thats paks perceptions... CPEC is one among multiple gateways.

CPEC is important due to 2 reasons 1) Oil from gulf 2) China's import/export to ME & Africa.

1) Chinese export to SE Asia , Europe, and NAmerica & SA not impacted  due to CPEC
5931 2018-05-04 17:52:21 these #'s come from the West regarding West Oil futures yet the bid is continually flooded with capital weeks going - so these numbers really mean nothing when the narrative is pure bull right? tia
5932 2018-05-04 17:52:17 I’m stuck in the past?  I’m not the one supporting a military that invades places for oil and control.

5934 2018-05-04 17:51:58 ooooo okay still try to clean around it with a q-tip. I would put some tea tree or vitamin e oil in a bit of water and try to swab it. Getting all the gunk and crust should help a bit :(

5936 2018-05-04 17:51:48 Government protected Standard Oil after it was already big. There's cartels protected by big government & regulators in many industries now in the US. Big pharma, Monsanto, the Federal Reserve, the military industrial complex. But go ahead & blame capitalism.
5937 2018-05-04 17:51:27 i’m doing a hot oil treatment on my hair and praying it actually heals  some of the damage i’ve done 
5938 2018-05-04 17:51:18 Wait. Weren’t those rich people and corporate tax cuts supposed to increase wages? Wasn’t easing regulations in US oil access supposed to give us cheap and excess oil to export (but gas prices went up over $.50/gallon)?
5939 2018-05-04 17:51:11 It’s a bit rich for islanders to get excited against tiny chance of oil spill when they are shitting untreated into the oceans. The same ones whose protest pipelines sitting in kayak made of oil. The gig is up. Facts are winning. Call me names if you wish. .
5940 2018-05-04 17:51:11 @MilitaryEarth in the end they the american government  spent 3.5 trillion dollers on the war in Iraq and Afghanistan and they didn't take the gas and oil of them why ?becuase  of the real STARGATE that is the trueth the answer  you all have been looking for was why if you don't
5941 2018-05-04 17:51:07 @Volkswagen @VWGroup #VWGroup stop Oil drilling, We don’t need dirty Oil. We need renewable energy
5942 2018-05-04 17:51:06 Ah! And zinc is practically a vitamin isn't it? I'd better lean in that direction anyway.

Makes my hands feel dry and dirty, tho. Maybe a bit of oil will help (without rubbing it off).
5943 2018-05-04 17:51:01 I’m acc gassed about my hair today like i washed it yesterday and i didn’t brush it cos it always goes poofy so i just put lots of oil on it and my waves stayed in place but it didn’t look messy
5944 2018-05-04 17:51:00 Spaghetti, garlic, olive oil... Parmesan or Romano cheese if you’re feeling fancy!
5945 2018-05-04 17:50:58 I'm guessing right up to the next election. They will promise. Then after the Trudeau is hired for second term they will dilly dally as the disabled aren't important as oil companies are and then forget the act until the third round. DeMockracy. @AndrewScheer  Cons no different.

5949 2018-05-04 17:50:22 I really wish InfoWars would ask me about socialism in Venezuela - this is not a critique of that wonderful young woman, I just want chance to explain to their wannabe provocateur that Venezuela's un-diversified economy could not withstand the huge drop in global oil prices
5950 2018-05-04 17:50:07 If you gone be fake Mexican this weekend & make tacos  please don’t have your ground beef swimming in oil. Drain 80% of it off beloved & add onions green pepper, red pepper and SEASONING.

5951 2018-05-04 17:50:05 You've come a long way from the day you mocked readers for drinking almond milk (height of the CA drought?)  but why no mention of which milks use palm oil products?

5953 2018-05-04 17:50:02 Speculative positioning in oil is now the largest net long EVER recorded
5954 2018-05-04 17:49:56 Today I introduced the Save Our Waters Bill to protect New York from offshore drilling. 

The bill will prohibit leases for oil and gas exploration in NY's waters, along with other measures to protect our waters even if the federal government goes ahead with their reckless plan.
5955 2018-05-04 17:49:51 Artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, sunflower seeds.
Toast the seeds in some mild olive oil, mix everything together, add to freshly cooked pasta.
Best pasta salad ever, and really easy.  (Still nice cold the next day, too :)
5956 2018-05-04 17:49:46 To add, they import gasoline by barge from the US, isn’t that environmentally more dangerous than pipelines, what about bringing oil on rail through the Rockies!!! Pipelines are safer and a FRIEND to the environment. The protestors are hypocrites!!!
5957 2018-05-04 17:49:42 I just wish they would explain which policies they like so much. The tax breaks for multinational corps? The destruction of the environment for no reason other than to please his big oil buddies? The bang up job done in Puerto Rico? The trade war he's started with China? Which?
5958 2018-05-04 17:49:32 Energy & Manufacturing...hmm...somehow I don't think the resources you were talking about were sun and wind, of which CO has plenty. How about responsibly developing those instead of ruining our lands with oil and gas? #ToppleTipton #CO3

5960 2018-05-04 17:49:23 The whole world There is a human being who has no conscience, but we try as much as possible to deal with the problem in Kuwait Unfortunately our problem is getting bigger when we think of solving it, oil alone does not cause success

5963 2018-05-04 17:49:03 Clean the jewelry, try to leave it out as long as you can without it closing - preferably over night. Saline spray is good to have on hand, salt water, and tea tre oil can help the inflammation as well as keloids! Try not to touch it with you hands and use a q-tip

5970 2018-05-04 17:48:00 I think Hugo Chavez' socialism was a convenient principle, to cover his naked grab for dictatorial powers. He was just some village idiot chieftain, who saw a chance to be a really big idiot, with an oil company to pay for it all.
5971 2018-05-04 17:47:45 It will not do anything to the government.  It is the poor people that will suffer and have to pay for everything double.  Iran can always sell its oil (Free Market or Black Market).

N. Korea has a lot of influence from China.  No country can influence Iran.

5977 2018-05-04 17:47:12 Puerto Rico is baby Dubai waiting for development, waiting for honest partnerships with American or other oil companies, companies that will give us our fair share of profits and help employ and train Puerto Rican people to power these industries.

5979 2018-05-04 17:46:15 Filthy rich oil producers cashing in before everyone switches over to electric, the demand for diesel has dropped dramatically over the last year, the price should be going down! 
That’s my take on it anyway.
5980 2018-05-04 17:45:55 how i forget to take my headphones out the car while i get my oil changed 
5981 2018-05-04 17:45:40 That likely means the oil runs right underneath the island.

5993 2018-05-04 17:44:18 @NigeriainfoFM The Buhari administration should stop the blame game and get to work! Oil prices recently rose to $75 per barrel.

6009 2018-05-04 17:42:13 @dstaples Latest example of Oil’s poor draft record. Not many 3rd-rounders make NHL but Edm’s draft-and-develop record is awful. Khaira now the only Edm draft after 1st round on the roster.
Nine 1st-rounders on roster, from years of suckage, tho they even Yakked one of those.

6018 2018-05-04 17:41:31 @MilitaryEarth we never for get and will all remember  them but the real reason they went in to Iraq  was not to kill Saddam Hussein  and take his oil and gas there was something
6019 2018-05-04 17:41:30 A7. Controlling sodium intake doesn’t mean spoiling the pleasure of eating out. Select fresh greens and fruits when available. Ask for oil and vinegar/lemon to top your salad or ask for low-sodium salad dressing or for dressing on the side . #FoodFri

6021 2018-05-04 17:41:13 Qatar is taking a stake in Rosneft of nearly 19 percent, rescuing the Russian oil major from its stalled deal to sell a major stake to China's CEFC.
6022 2018-05-04 17:41:13 Statehood is a trap that will take all of your property in property taxes. Independence is the proper course for the Puerto Rican people. Our Islands natural resources remain untapped. Puerto Rico oil reserves and Pharmaceutical industry, coupled with tourism, off shore banking..
6023 2018-05-04 17:41:01 Oil rallied Friday, as growing concerns over the economic crisis in  Venezuela and possible new sanctions against Iran raised the potential  for tighter global crude supplies and sent prices toward their highest  settlement since late 2014.
6024 2018-05-04 17:41:00 That 6% is scientists who are paid huge salaries by the oil companies, coal industry, and other major corporations to lie. Remove them from the equation and the number is much closer to 0%.
6025 2018-05-04 17:40:47 Amazing stupidity.  This same stupidity also resulted in some in NE burning oil to generate electricity this past winter due to lack of ng pipelines.
6026 2018-05-04 17:40:39 The explanation is Trumps buddies in the oil industry r doing very well

6030 2018-05-04 17:40:08 I agree with the general point but the problem is that New England politics have been unable to deal with their winter fuel supply issues for years. NE went way in on gas to get rid of oil; ISO-NE would rather not deal with this but they have a mandate to maintain reliability

6052 2018-05-04 17:37:19 No not what works for me.  Its not the same as opioids at all .  I can instruct the best way to make oil or butter the correct way.  Then they can figure out what dosage works for them and make whatever they prefer.
6053 2018-05-04 17:37:09 I'm so angry I'm even crying. I went to the kitchen for a few minutes and now I'm coming back to the lounge kugcwele my hair oil on the sofa and on the floor  my 2 year old nephew spilled all of it

6056 2018-05-04 17:36:59 And just like that, the day has gone to crap. I got the van back on Wednesday, but a part was wrong. I got that swapped out yesterday. Cool, right? Nope. Then today the oil took a leak. As in completely empty. I'm not a happy camper right now. Can I go just back to the beach?

6059 2018-05-04 17:36:32 Notice how they can't be restored on Earth? Its a common gimmick with snake oil salesmen. How about Down syndrome?
6060 2018-05-04 17:36:20 Pipeline not only strengthen our business is - it creates jobs, gives people opportunities and releive our dependence on foreign oil in dictatorial countries. Why didnt we get the Northern Gateway, Energy East, and Kinder Morgan?
6061 2018-05-04 17:35:54 It was made painfully obvious the socialist left does not care how this impacts the productive members of society. As Mr. Spady said, the votes have already been cast and nothing is stopping this. I feel like I'm watching the real life version of Atlas Shrugged.

And so far it looks like baking soda mixed with tea tree oil works good enough....

6073 2018-05-04 17:33:39 Spot crude is nearing $70.00 a barrel. Watch tonight's video for my new top level. Right now, oil still has more upside in the cards.
6074 2018-05-04 17:33:29 Some people must be looking for oil deposits with the way they be digging their noses .
6075 2018-05-04 17:33:29 Imo it's a possibility. Just the idea of exporting our oil at world prices will strengthen the CAD, reducing pump prices quickly.

6111 2018-05-04 17:28:03 if there was any doubt about oil price being kept up by the Fed to engineer inflation, today removes it. Zero sense in terms of fundamentals and even geopolitical issues - this is just simply relentless buying to justify the next rate hike.
6112 2018-05-04 17:27:55 In America (north and south) they give you dressing (ranch, mayonnaise, etc) with your salad. In Spain they give you olive oil and wine vinegar <3 I’m glad I forgot to tell them not to give me any :)

6137 2018-05-04 17:24:19 Perhaps very small or shrinking population is responsible for such high tax rates in countries like Sweden, Japan or Netherlands.

And oil rich countries like Russia and Saudi can afford such low tax rates!

my family may not fully understand all that i do, but they fully support it in the ways they can. even more so, since the oil i made for my dad helped.

6145 2018-05-04 17:23:29 Bio oil helped me a LOT, but they’re at a point now where only laser remover would get rid  I hate them too, I cry at least once a week over them 
6146 2018-05-04 17:23:23 Thanks! This one is basically made up of coconut oil, shea butter, olive oil, and a couple of other things aside from magnesium, so it's pretty gently on the skin. Which is good, because I've got super sensitive skin.

6154 2018-05-04 17:22:28 Last year Saudis bought 100 billions $ worth US weapons & there was oil glut in world. Now the oil facet been turned down so oil price goes up and Saudis profit to pay for all those weapons. 
US Military Complex will never complain, nope.  @catoletters
6155 2018-05-04 17:22:22 Higher oil prices needed to ramp US domestic production in light of China PetroYuan - #PetroGold trade. Will ultimately squeeze supply to West. #OOTT
6156 2018-05-04 17:22:16 Marx missed the part where humans (evolved to care about close friends and family) have little incentive to work hard for strangers, if slack pays the same.  And that this would mean financial and human capital would have to be walled in and whipped to oil the machine.
6157 2018-05-04 17:22:16 I used to get an oil change for Enterprise in 20 minutes, so it baffles me that it takes an hour at a chain store.
6158 2018-05-04 17:22:13 Hilarious how this @logicperseveres guy touts oil fundamentals on his twitter description, yet he doesn't provide a reliable measure or metric on US distillate demand. He just wonders off into more word salad.

6164 2018-05-04 17:21:46 @realDonaldTrump  Mr. President, please focus on oil and gas prices.  This is going to kill small business and your tax cuts are worthless. Speculators are sucking every penny for themselves.  Prices in $1.30 today and we have had an embargo on Iranian oil for years.

6167 2018-05-04 17:21:38 Not sure... I do recall her being a CL perma-bull was calling for $70 oil. But, as a 'day-trader' making those prognostications are as useless as watching Cramer. $55-$45 she was bullish. She was always bullish.

6172 2018-05-04 17:20:56 But, I certainly do not believe speculation over the possible affect on international, average, per barrel oil prices - which will, at the same time be buffeted by many other forces - should be a consideration in seeking to determine the right thing.
6173 2018-05-04 17:20:50 I’m thinking of buying the Black Up foundation again.

6176 2018-05-04 17:20:32 The discomfort goes away when you pay them well and treat them like any other employee you'd like to retain. There's nothing shameful about hiring someone to work for you. I know how to change the oil in my car but I hire someone else to do it. Not embarrassing at all.
6177 2018-05-04 17:20:21 So the only ones that are in any way funded outside of general taxation or corporate charity are funded by oil revenue, and all of the experiments so far take place in an environment where existing benefits such as universal healthcare continue to exist for participants.

6187 2018-05-04 17:19:21 The fact of the matter is no one can change the price. Its all-time high in the world. No one has control over. So stop crying. And people are dumb that they don't understand how gas/oil price works.

6207 2018-05-04 17:17:19 Most Teslas are powered by hydrocarbons, just at the point of electrical generation and not at the point of consumer use.  These vehicles do not reduce dependence on oil any less than any other cars, and have other environmental consequences such as horrific Lithium strip mining.

6220 2018-05-04 17:16:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, yet welfare use will decrease.
6221 2018-05-04 17:15:58 Alternatives aren't there yet. All plastics are made of oil and that includes hospital equipment. If a environmentelly friendly method of storing power is invented then maybe renewables, but for now oil is all we have. It prolongs life
6222 2018-05-04 17:15:28 Why does every doctor frown upon CBD oil? Since my girlfriend got diagnosed with epilepsy she has went from 7 seizures a day to about 7 a week, just from CBD oil and no anti-seizure medicine. Some doctors are so brainwashed! 
6223 2018-05-04 17:15:06 Either every 3,000 miles or when ever ur oil level goes to 20 or 15 percent

6238 2018-05-04 17:13:42 At this level crude oil is going beyond $70. Especially if it closes above 69.56, going hand in hand with the Dollar weakness and Euro strength coming in towards end of day.
6239 2018-05-04 17:13:37 Living in GA where cannabis oil is legal by prescription for like a dozen issues is funny. Because while they can prescribe it, its not legal to sell. So you have to get on a plane and transport it yourself. LOL

6251 2018-05-04 17:12:38 I think you are over-estimating even the maximum potential benefits of CAFE. It was never going to trigger a shift from oil to other fuels. 

But setting that aside, the question is not whether adding new highways will increase fuel use. It probably will. The question is...
6252 2018-05-04 17:12:31 I said "not in my case." Because I have no idea what you're talking about when you say that. "Incel" is primarily a self-descriptor, not a pejorative.

6266 2018-05-04 17:10:07 Just a little bit of oil, and... Come on! Come on, you little son of a bitch!

6274 2018-05-04 17:09:32 As much as I hate Trump we want some actual sane people on his staff. Elon Musk was a good addition, anyone that can work in the administration that isn’t a fucking banker or oil guy is good

6276 2018-05-04 17:09:29 life’s inconveniences literally make me go broke. tires, speeding tickets, dr. bills, oil changes, etc. i can never stay all the way ahead.
6277 2018-05-04 17:09:28 Yeah, I seem to recall spending at least 5 minutes after the scorpion was put together carefully bending the legs so they were all touching the ground and balanced at the same time.

I'm working on the off shore oil rig right now. Very many tiny pieces, taking a long time.

6283 2018-05-04 17:08:49 The president of Nigeria as a former Military head in Nigeria is under estimating the power of the south. The south of Nigeria can bring weapon that even the government of Nigeria don't have to the south. At most the south can pay with their crude oil to be safe
6284 2018-05-04 17:08:47 #OOTT I’ve said in the past OPEC should erect a statue of Maduro in front of its HQ in Vienna for the best-in-class mismanagement of its oil industry & contribution to OPEC+ cuts.

6290 2018-05-04 17:07:49 I have a very solid understanding of women. I never answer the question “does this look fat?”  I generally go change the oil in her Mercedes until that passes.
6291 2018-05-04 17:07:47 It's so easy to gain social media popularity and funding with anti palm oil messaging. Never mind that neither actually saves forests in palm oil producing countries

6298 2018-05-04 17:07:14 Snake oil salesman getting free pub to promote more snake oil. Disgusting. Oh, and what does Bill Belichick know about any of this. Has snake oil salesman TB on his team so there's that.
6299 2018-05-04 17:07:14 I had a spider in my ear once. It did the same thing until I drowned it in olive oil. I immediately went to the ER. 9 days!? I was half way to hysteria after 20 minutes.
6300 2018-05-04 17:07:13 Aye, help. Cooking with canola and oil doesn’t cause acne right? I feel like when I get my chef on my face gets oily then I get dumb shit on my nose. Either that is the cause or it’s just the devil trying to hold back my sexy
6301 2018-05-04 17:07:11 I’m finna meltttttt. Baby oil & heat don’t mix 
6302 2018-05-04 17:07:02 Majority = largest number of the population i.e. the people across Libya who are getting their salaries, pensions, subsidised fuel, $400 & 500 family cards, etc.. paid as a result of having oil export income available. It is not perfect/adequate but helps the people get through.
6303 2018-05-04 17:06:59 Waffles also vary slightly in batter in terms of ingredients, they usually contain more oil or butter than pancakes to get a crisp outside yet fluffy inside
6304 2018-05-04 17:06:53 3 grams of standard oil for this weekend
6305 2018-05-04 17:06:53 2/2 not many people are aware of how many different names it can come under and may buy products completely unaware of it containing palm oil. I no I have been caught out in this way and wish companies would label their products containing palm oil with simple labels

6309 2018-05-04 17:06:30 Do you think oil will be below $30 by end of this year?
6310 2018-05-04 17:06:30 None needed brother, oil and money
6311 2018-05-04 17:06:27 Do you really think offshore oil and gas is environmentally sustainable?
6312 2018-05-04 17:06:17 What happens when you build a Islamic nation?  Just look over to Pakistan.  Arabs are lucky they have oil, else they would have been worse off then even Pakistan. #pakpraisestipusultan

6314 2018-05-04 17:05:52 Had an Olbas Oil bath to try and soothe my aches from today. I lay there looking at the million hamd prints on our mirror wall, the water streaks on the shower screen and the dust clogging up the extractor fan. Not very relaxing in the end. Need to bathe blindfolded 
6315 2018-05-04 17:05:27 Not in my case. I think anyone who thinks that sex is a right can get in line at Feel The Bern HQ. It isn't a right. It's a privilege.
6316 2018-05-04 17:05:26 Quite a productive Friday off. Oil change, laundry and some cleaning up around the place. Can’t wait to watch the @Brewers tonight for #MayThe4th @starwars night at @millerpark #GoBrewers

6322 2018-05-04 17:04:11 I know we continue corporate war, bully small nations, destroy labor unions, provide the worst health care of any democracy, promulgate great economic inequality, provide shoddy education and Big Defense, Big Oil, Big Banking, Big Pharma, Big Agra and the drug war does very well!
6323 2018-05-04 17:04:09 U.S. Rig Count is up 11 rigs from last week to 1,032, with oil rigs up 9 to 834, gas rigs up 1 to 196, and miscellaneous rigs up 1 to 2.

The U.S. Offshore Rig Count is up 1 rig to 19 and unchanged year-over-year. #OOTT
6324 2018-05-04 17:04:08 That isn't what defines capitalism for us, but as it happens they in fact are profit-driven. Even liberals often recognize the role of oil access, for instance, in motivating US military action
6325 2018-05-04 17:03:52 i guess there is no oil or gas there so it will be ok

This is happening, because of rigged game.

6371 2018-05-04 17:00:50 The assertion that nothing can exist that has not been created or made requires that petrochemicals can be made.

6383 2018-05-04 17:00:00 Well, several things. First, we have solutions on shelf for most of this, excepting air transport. That is going to be very difficult, and is obviously a major focus.

But the oil and car lobbies are helping to ensure, aggressively, that the transition is slower than necessary.

6400 2018-05-04 16:58:17 It’s amazing what we are willing to tolerate for our precious oil.

6405 2018-05-04 16:58:02 Hi Daniel, I'm sorry about the confusion between soap and oatcakes, I'm going to have a look into the palm oil free soap and will get back to you once I know more. Thank you for your patients regarding this matter. Thanks - Paul
6406 2018-05-04 16:58:01 If #oil breaches 80$ in 2months following the 2008 or later trend my buddy bets to shave his head. Oil bulls must laugh at him but let's remember this tweet.
6407 2018-05-04 16:57:34 They stay tryna get you to do extra stuff, i went for a oil change and ended up paying lik 200.
6408 2018-05-04 16:57:08 It appears that the fossil fuel lobby would prefer that we not refer to the infrastructure that enables most of the world's oil to be burnt as fossil fuel infrastructure.

Keep that in mind next time your Mayor gets behind a parking lot or freeway project.
6409 2018-05-04 16:57:05  I hate when they offer me stuff! like just change my oil!
6410 2018-05-04 16:56:51 Banning free speech, how open minded of them. 
6411 2018-05-04 16:56:45 Fiscal situation will definitely improve if oil cools off

6415 2018-05-04 16:56:08 Still waiting Fellow. The only portions proven are that Carter Page met with reps from the oil company and that Trump had business ties to Russia. The rest is unproven.
6416 2018-05-04 16:56:04 Two rare crude oil exports out of Oregon have been sent to China so far this year. Possibly a third set sail at the end of April. Heavy Canadian is being railed to Portland, then sent on its way. #oott #oilexports
6417 2018-05-04 16:56:03 People buy into herbalife and snake oil willingly too. That doesn't make them less of a scam. And yes vitalik and his pals were deceitful promoting eth, for example, saying bitcoin lacks smart contracts to promote their coin.

6421 2018-05-04 16:55:37 InfoWars sucks and she was two degrees above absolute zero, but how did she possibly own them?  To own them she would have said all the petrostates were suffering with low oil prices, except Norway of course, which is even more socialist but invested its bounty.

6425 2018-05-04 16:55:00 Yeap just found that out about 3 weeks ago too. Chuck them into a tray with some Olive oil and sprinkle them with  a bit of whatever spice flavour stuff you have around. Cajun, paprika or steak. 30-40mins, turn halfway. It's the lazy-mans ideal meal

6458 2018-05-04 16:51:19 I appreciate you have a job to do. So do I.

If you deny that the largest driver of oil demand is cars, and that freeways are as much a part of a car as a piston, then we can drop this discussion.

6464 2018-05-04 16:50:40 we often talk to our companies about the best way to capture value from their innovation - imagine you had an amazing software tool to find oil, would it be better to sell it to the oil co's or look for oil yourself? often co's have to do more of the stack than they expect

6489 2018-05-04 16:48:02 Not all corporations are oil companies. Many are small businesses who want to hire people but can't because of the tax burden. I've been in that position before.
6490 2018-05-04 16:47:59 Don’t worry. Third world still is burning oil and paying a lot of money for each gas liter

6496 2018-05-04 16:47:41 The fracking phenomenon was propelled forward not because of ground-breaking advances in oil extraction but rather because of 1) cheap credit, and 2) to harm Russia.  Obama's blocking of Keystone XL wasn't because of his compassion for Earth but because of lack of profitability.

6535 2018-05-04 16:43:32 Fair enough. But it’s might does not mean it must not be challenged. If anything its might is the very reason why it must be constantly challenged and kept in check because left to its own devices it can be very dangerous to society.

6602 2018-05-04 16:36:42 My nephew operates cranes on oil rigs in the North sea so he has a good view of the waters around him. I showed him the go fast footage which he instantly called out as a bird and when I asked him to let me know if he sees anything strange over the waters the convo stopped. lol
6603 2018-05-04 16:36:40 The only sketch comedy group that has accepted payments for oil in ONLY US currency.
6604 2018-05-04 16:36:27 This is fantastic, Kevin! You clearly share your brother's concern for environmental issues - it's wonderful to see such an entertaining viz that highlights deforestation from palm oil consumption. Love it!

6610 2018-05-04 16:35:59 These days you don't even need to "know" a Russian. If you don't let the oil/gas drilling companies have their way with us, & put pipelines wherever they want, then you must be a Russian stooge. 
6611 2018-05-04 16:35:33 This is called fishing journalism. They provoke u, if u answer they either misquote u according to their interpretation or if u got provoked they fry u in ur own oil.
They do this for self serving purposes of gaining headlines. Press con nowadays  r like river w/ full of crocs.
6612 2018-05-04 16:35:28 Aye.  I well remember strolling through the palm oil plantations in my youth.  Actually, Pattersons don't use Palm oil and make a good oatcake.  @Tesco used to sell them, but don't now.
6613 2018-05-04 16:35:21 Oil prices jump another 2%. The question remains, if @realdonaldtrump realizes that he does alot of damage to his people. Higher prices for oil usually means lesser spending what will bring stocks down. This could end in a bear market.
6614 2018-05-04 16:35:15 You are throwing shades to the other side of Manchester. Noisy Arab -oil money neighbours.
6615 2018-05-04 16:35:11 Lots great projects here, just cannot get the oil to market! Industrial commodities are the place to be, IMO. New cycle is happening! Canada is one backwards country. Even Russia eats our lunch! GL

6624 2018-05-04 16:34:42 GMO, soy, corn syrup, canola oil is in everything as main component of fish to fake fruit, you know?

6632 2018-05-04 16:33:27 Spinach, red pepper, cucumber, salted pumpkin seeds, dried cranberries, feta, and kalamata olives. Dressing: equal parts olive oil, honey, Dijon mustard, and balsamic vinegar.
6633 2018-05-04 16:33:25 And it's a flawed narrative as the economic benefits of transitioning towards clean energy would help strengthen the economy more than continuing with fossil fuels. However, they don't care about public health impacts, as that doesn't help the profits for oil and gas companies.
6634 2018-05-04 16:33:23 They are simply put where they are now is not down to players it’s purely down to money oil oil oil loads of it is why Man City are where they are today without the money they could not attract any players to the club they buy titles and trophies Simple
6635 2018-05-04 16:33:21 Since when did beard oil cost so much
6636 2018-05-04 16:33:13 Cannabis won't be legal until the oil & gas industry realize it's a more cost efficient, alternative source of energy.

6637 2018-05-04 16:33:13 Recently looked at every bar of soap in my local supermarket. Everyone had palm oil in..also surprised to see every brand of oat cake had palm oil in, even the traditional style Scottish ones...because you know, palm oil is a traditional style Scottish ingredient...
6638 2018-05-04 16:33:13 Oil baths?
6639 2018-05-04 16:33:09 Whatever happened to the Sentients? They must still have an empathy chip right? I mean they can't paint all humans with the same 'baddy' brush can they? Who will change their oil and repair them once all the humans are eliminated?
6640 2018-05-04 16:33:01 Look at this sis @BraveNewKnee
6641 2018-05-04 16:32:40 He would be a great pick for the Oil, but I can't see him being available at 10th overall.

6646 2018-05-04 16:32:01 The 20th century shifted the caloric burden from slaves to oil, with the aid of mechanization. Now we are saying it is unethical to use petroleum to achieve our standard of living. But that way of life still comes at a cost to our environment.
6647 2018-05-04 16:32:00 Your answer is to curb oil demand not supply

6652 2018-05-04 16:31:34 setting powder makes or breaks how oily i get. i use the coty airspun translucent powder & the. spray my face with the urban decay all nighter spray. if you moisturize definitely don’t use cream moisturizer bc it adds more oil to your face, use gel moisturizer instead
6653 2018-05-04 16:31:31 okay! basically the guys at midas that “fixed” my muffler after my accident did a shitty job and a piece fell off and the guy at the oil change place just was giving me the piece 
6654 2018-05-04 16:31:30 Wait, didn’t @GovMurphy just sign a bill banning oil drilling offshore of New Jersey? If NJ can do it, why can’t NY?

6656 2018-05-04 16:31:24 Same viewpoint I've had for months.. institutions want to sell oil above 73. keep buying dips till then
6657 2018-05-04 16:31:12 The truth always hurt but Oil has been very poor along with alot of the so called superstars. Martin's comments are just the season has been poor and alot of this current squad are not fit to pull on that great Jersey.
6658 2018-05-04 16:31:09 The part that squeaks the loudest gets the oil

6687 2018-05-05 23:58:50 Don’t get me wrong I think everyone should know how to change a tire, but by that logic everyone should always change their oil and spark plugs but I bet most people don’t either

6697 2018-05-05 23:56:21 If am drunk I'll jump the gun, otherwise I can't be arsed. Up my way the most common jobs are fishing and oil, I see first hand how they are getting shafted, that's why I know nobody can argue that point with me.

6699 2018-05-05 23:55:43 People came into New Orleans Charity Hospital ER with that problem back when I worked there.

6728 2018-05-05 23:52:18 Oil price may be factored in, but O&G company stocks are lagging way behind. There’s been too much noise for investors to notice.
6729 2018-05-05 23:52:07 I always find it fascinating the people who accidentally settled on top of a bunch of oil think it's their hard work that resulted in their prosperity.
6730 2018-05-05 23:51:55 It seems like everyone goes thru a relationship every oil change

6737 2018-05-05 23:50:05 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
6738 2018-05-05 23:50:03 Fine. But a lot of the regulation that has elevated the cost of operations in the oil industry was put in place by the Conservatives as was the nonsensical idea to increase royalties. Not the NDP. We’ll see what kind of fortitude you have. Expectations are high. #cdnpoli
6739 2018-05-05 23:49:33 Big Oil are way too smart to waste money on your skill level

Again - you’re not reading the science - you’re not reading the journals - you’re reading from denialist data sources and obtaining an unrealistic view of the data and the theory
6740 2018-05-05 23:49:31 The aforementioned limits only apply to cannabis oil. Dried cannabis has no limits. Our kief is actually 35% THC (on a potential basis), which is actually 350 mg THC per 1 gram (1000 mg) kief.
6741 2018-05-05 23:49:23 I suppose.  Someone I know would have probably just shot it. So, I suppose oil is better than dead.
6742 2018-05-05 23:49:19 ダイエットしていたって、時にはオイルも必要だろう?

6744 2018-05-05 23:48:24 @abdouggg baby u have oil 
I have missiles 
Let's trade
6745 2018-05-05 23:48:14 That simply isn't true. Iran jacked up oil prices as a direct result of Trump's rhetoric. China dumped our soybeans for Trump's trade stance. I'd say that's a classic example of cause and effect.
6746 2018-05-05 23:48:13 Marinating some steak in lime juice, olive oil, chopped garlic, chopped jalapeño and fresno chilies, salt, pepper and ground cumin. Should be good.
6747 2018-05-05 23:48:05 Good for you. I lived near Rice University in Houston for 4 years/ weather was too hot. My point. Good for you. You live in an oil producing state. It was your reaction to others complaints about their gas complaints and why they were disturbed was bizarre. That's it.
6748 2018-05-05 23:47:54 …snake oil salesman…digital will never replace manufacturing & computers suck electricity generated from fossil fuels…people = carbon…is a simple fact…cut demand & cut carbon…
6749 2018-05-05 23:47:44 --a new product of Gold Bond -- over priced cod live oil. The commercials could be good.

6751 2018-05-05 23:47:05 Oil of Olay!  Seriously, though,  how fabulous to get such a lengthy mention. Totally deserved.
6752 2018-05-05 23:46:50 So it seems not having a 'point' makes one a 'huckster'.

Since your fixation on this issue seems to have no point, what snake oil are you trying to sell?

Seems we are surrounded by pointless hucksters in this situation.
6753 2018-05-05 23:46:17 @mysticalmarissa hey can you DM me I’d like to ask for more information about neem oil please, thank you x
6754 2018-05-05 23:46:09 The only thing missing from your tweet storm is accusing me of being paid by Big Oil.  Or, more probably, being duped by Big Oil.

According to climate hysterics, intelligent people can't possibly research the evidence and come to an independent and different conclusion.
6755 2018-05-05 23:45:55 Same for you, and give us your thoughts for the "US$ 300 Oil" stuff... 
6756 2018-05-05 23:45:55 I don't think eating it would be good idea; only a dog would do that anyway. \
 Perhaps some cod-liver oil on the Tuna?
6757 2018-05-05 23:45:49 صح كلامك
6758 2018-05-05 23:45:43 You need some kind of dressing for that cauli my friend. A lil' olive oil; some thyme; salt n pepa...
6759 2018-05-05 23:45:34 Highly likely it’s cooking oil. You really think it would be engine oil?
6760 2018-05-05 23:45:29 fuckin we need sunscreen and bug spray that dont feel make u feel like you were dipped in oil and then rolled in eraser shavings

6778 2018-05-05 23:41:14 As long as Trump & Kushner keep screwing up relations with the Middle East ticking everyone off, messing up relationships instead of negotiating mutually satisfying ones gas will continue rising, for his oil company buddies!
6779 2018-05-05 23:40:52 If you've got a place near you that sells it, add a bunch of lavender essential oil to aloe vera, shake it up, and put it in the fridge for half an hour. The cool aloe will feel great on the burns, and the lavender helps heal the burns and relieves the stinging quickly.

6794 2018-05-05 23:39:17 Some sort of nasty die-cast alloy. Brittle with some nasty voids and inclusions. Not zinc, probably some aluminium mix designed for good performance for die-casting.  I tried to get a decent finish but it is grainy. Sprayed cutting fluid no help, oil flood ditto. Scotchbrite ftw
6795 2018-05-05 23:39:09 I thought that frying onions in oil made the best smell in the kitchen... but then I fried garlic in butter.

6801 2018-05-05 23:38:03 Insure you have a decent wok and oil.
6802 2018-05-05 23:37:53 Well, there's no oil money involved so she can make herself look good on this one.

6804 2018-05-05 23:37:00 My dear eat a lot of cocumber n use castor oil u gud to go. Ur hair will grow full n soft d cocumber does a lot to ur body also n u can condition ur hair with cocumber purry .. try it n tank me later..
6805 2018-05-05 23:36:59 Use coconut oil. It even has a small amount of SPF to protect your skin but still give you a tan at the same time
6806 2018-05-05 23:36:53 Drunk Elephant is on the pricey side but their face oil works like a charm! It’s unscented so it shouldn’t irritate your skin, their other products also are to die for
6807 2018-05-05 23:36:47 There were chaos in Africa during Obama's regime. Look at Egypt, look at Syria, look at Algeria, then look at Libya(just cry in silence).

Back to climate change, if u knew how oil is gotten & how it keeps Africa alive u as an African, u would go down on your knees & thank Trump
6808 2018-05-05 23:36:29 For him, it's the purported health benefits (which are bogus, as far as I can discover -- one kind of olive oil is as good as any other). TBH, if it was human trafficking / labor abuse, I'd be onboard
6809 2018-05-05 23:36:28 Mmm would say it’s a thicker consistency of coconut oil sunscreen. And double check the shade you buy because I ended up with the lighter one!
6810 2018-05-05 23:36:24 I don’t ever want to see anyone ghost or French inhale a vape pen unless it has thc oil in it
6811 2018-05-05 23:35:39 It reduces likelihood of future emissions and saves us allowing the risk of oil spills from exploration for oil the world can’t afford to burn.
6812 2018-05-05 23:35:38 I live in the oil field so my alert is up pretty high when it comes to meeting people out here, especially men.
6813 2018-05-05 23:35:22 Oil is good for sooooo many things..

6819 2018-05-05 23:34:13 These are no doubt the same type of allegedly “clear signalling” that was apparently happening before new oil and gas exploration was banned. If I were a farmer, I’d be very afraid.
6820 2018-05-05 23:34:09 Yes
He is so idealistic because he doesnt live in the real world.

#canada has yhe 3rd or 2nd largest oil reserves in the world and we are paying so much for gas! Why?

F*ck the carbon tax

Say na 'Bottle of Red oil'

6826 2018-05-05 23:33:39 I CAME FOR A SIMPLE FUCKING OIL CHANGE AND LEFT WITH THAT, A NEW AIR FILTER, FUEL FILTER, TRANSMISSION SERVICES, AND AN ANTIFREEZE TOP OFF  IM SO MAD THATS LIKE $250 
6827 2018-05-05 23:33:19 Omg so I've been struggling with my hair being kinda gross lately - getting buildup and greasy etc - but I did an acid wash this morning & already it's so much better and cleaner feeling. Just 1tsp apple cider vinegar, half cup of water, and some lavender oil, used after shampoo
6828 2018-05-05 23:33:14 Oh yeah I remember those good old days when we would gather around the oil stove and read our calculus and opengl textbooks .
6829 2018-05-05 23:33:07 Love references to Trump watching @BBCHolbyCity re. knife crime. IMHO he’s clearly more a @BBCCasualty guy. Just when you think he puts a knife into the toaster & will get his bread out..BOOM.. ludicrous hair...unattached..insert out of control oil tanker with knife stage left...
6830 2018-05-05 23:32:30 I actually did that. Worked for a day, then they wore the oil off! I have up to 10 squirrels (highest count one morning) that show up....
6831 2018-05-05 23:32:19 ปวดหลัง
6832 2018-05-05 23:32:14 AB is fine, energy is the past, heavy oil not needed, EE cancelled by company, renewables are in all ways superior...Hard to find anyone more anti energy. When combined with need to import foreign oil to meet our domestic needs my suspicions are fair.
6833 2018-05-05 23:32:06 I deep condition, use a hair moisturizer preferably olive oil based, put some softee hair grease on then a little castor oil on my roots lol. My hair will stay moisturized for a good minute
6834 2018-05-05 23:32:04 Oil > Petrochemistry > Medicinal chemistry > Wet chemistry > Spectrometer > Physics > Electrostatics > Faraday's law of induction > Torus
6835 2018-05-05 23:31:46 qihn fun facts even tho nobody cares
-B.H.'s name stands for Banana Hawaii
-Oil is bronze but gives off light making him look gold
-Oil is a celebrity whos either hated or loved by everyone
-Quasar doesnt know if th keyhole on her chest is real or fake and shes scared to find out
6836 2018-05-05 23:31:43 On another possible answer to your question, oil seed rape is a very attractive plant to pollinating insects. In general I see insects attracted to it and other brassica plants ahead of many competing species. Presumably because it provides a generous source of nectar & pollen.
6837 2018-05-05 23:31:38 @FlySeaborne @silver_airways @AmericanAir Booked Seabourne 4510 SJU/EIS 04 May through AA.  Passenger had to alert pilot oil was coming out of engine. Returned to SJU and had to take different airline. Would not give me my bags and 2 days later still no bags no calls.  Need help
6838 2018-05-05 23:31:33 Olive oil in his veins!!
6839 2018-05-05 23:31:23 I just read that if it does work, it'll happen within 24 hours. So brb, going to get some castor oil.
6840 2018-05-05 23:31:17 That looks like an oil painting. Incredible
6841 2018-05-05 23:31:02 Opec is driving up oil prices which drives gas prices. Opec is constantly getting away with this tactic. No matter how much oil the U.S. drills for Opec screws us all. My concern is the GOP increasing the Fed Gas Tax 25 cents a gallon. Corporations can write it off, we can't.
6842 2018-05-05 23:31:01 mint juleps < drinking motor oil
6843 2018-05-05 23:31:00 Thx for heads-up; just checked it, seems steep for what you get. I’ll do the basics like alignments elsewhere, and will get Tesla-specific service done at Tesla when required, rather than service plan. Will still save on oil changes and brakes :)
6844 2018-05-05 23:30:54 Serrr
6845 2018-05-05 23:30:53 This game is nuts...
6846 2018-05-05 23:30:43 Even electric cars require motor oil and plastics. Oil will be around for a while yet.
6847 2018-05-05 23:29:47 Because of an old boys club of greed, wealth, power, corruption between oil/gas industry and politicians. They don't care about the Earth.
6848 2018-05-05 23:29:44 What a massive braincramp by the Sixers. Perhaps calling that timeout would've been a wise move...wow
6849 2018-05-05 23:29:26 Like all elitists, David Suzuki thinks the rules apply to everybody except himself. He has no problem flying around the world racking up a massive carbon footprint, yet wants to destroy the oil industry. Such a hypocrite doesn’t deserve an honorary degree.
6850 2018-05-05 23:29:15 Cuz that guy looks like a bottle of red oil
6851 2018-05-05 23:29:11 Yeah it’s called business.... I’m tryna get some oil from overseas
6852 2018-05-05 23:29:08 When a country constantly changes “death to America “ there should be no deals at all . Oil prices be damned .
6853 2018-05-05 23:29:07 ultrasonic oil difuser has my room smelling like lavender!
6854 2018-05-05 23:29:07 Keep on drilling... U will soon reach oil 
6855 2018-05-05 23:29:06 Nothing like spilling half of the oil you're using to change the oil in your car.... Nothing quite like that feeling....
6856 2018-05-05 23:29:05 my dad getting stuck behind a car from texas - “oh my god this texas queer, go back to texas freakin gay gas and oil guy, go back to freakin texas” 
6857 2018-05-05 23:29:04 Carbohydrates, volatile oil, bitter principles
6858 2018-05-05 23:28:57 My mom drank castor oil to pop me out I guess... jus saying lol

6860 2018-05-05 23:28:45 Olive Oil >>>>> Butter
6861 2018-05-05 23:28:39 Me: i feel like i smell like tanning oil and sweat

Bella: I smell like sweat and chicken
6862 2018-05-05 23:28:09 Nope.  My little trump is still stuck in the hole in this coconut.  The oil didn't do a thing.
6863 2018-05-05 23:28:06 yeah sure 99.99% of scientists agree that global warming is caused by humans... but according to my uncle: “oil comes from the ground, it is good”

Checkmate Libtards!!!
6864 2018-05-05 23:28:01 buy water do not ever use faucet water in cooking , drinking for it is originated in faucetts , the saying it's clean , wherever you may be with , the oil i love are Greek  you Italye , a healthy habit
6865 2018-05-05 23:27:58 why hasn't america invaded everyone yet everyone has oil
6866 2018-05-05 23:27:35 A great man. As Liverpudlian's we never loved him. But we will always respect him. His love of the rivalry between LFC & lasted forever. Cap doffed forever for his club re-building without Russian gas or Arab oil. Best wishes, Fergie.
6867 2018-05-05 23:27:29 You're a democratic socialist if you've ever filled up your vehicle with gasoline:   the oil & gas industry is subsidized, for your benefit, by tens of billions of taxpayer dollars....
6868 2018-05-05 23:27:19 Followed all! Please follow back
6869 2018-05-05 23:27:17 Take away the corp welfare from oil companies and prices are about the same. 

Sham is that CC is fake. Libsnare sick of big oil getting more welfare.
6870 2018-05-05 23:26:50 I think the olive oil thing is due to fraud in the industry or something. Or is there some purported health benefit?

6872 2018-05-05 23:26:25 I put on my beard detangler and my beard conditioning oil and my beard smells so nice right now.
6873 2018-05-05 23:26:22 He is a whiny snake oil salesman, I’ve listened to years of his interviews and it’s the same narrative, he has a high time preference based on his own angle. Transparent sham
6874 2018-05-05 23:26:20 The latest oil boom in the Permian Basin has only added about 3,500 jobs. Why r we still giving these rich guys tax breaks & subsidizing them when our teachers & their retirement funds r getting screwed? It’s b/c of bought votes thru lobbying. When r we going to learn?
6875 2018-05-05 23:25:46 Has anyone but me noticed the gasoline prices exploding in there area?  I thought we were a oil exporter now, why are our prices so high? We need some relief before the summer season starts!

6877 2018-05-05 23:25:09 omg onions would be so hard, they're in everything.

avocado is the biggest pain (like more than mango and papaya) because people are using it as an alternative to oil these days so I gotta watch baked goods and brownies and stuff.
6878 2018-05-05 23:25:01 Question.... why is there olive oil in the tub? Bath time moisturizer I suppose?
6879 2018-05-05 23:24:54 I have a cooking question. When I was pregnant I chucked out all of my flaky teflon cookware and replaced them all with stainless steal pots and pans.  I'm finding that I'm getting frustrated now tho and using more oil/butter.  What do others use? #HTLWWGroup
6880 2018-05-05 23:24:46 Megan, you already know @GovMaryFallin is literally a joke and couldn’t care less about Oklahomans or their families. She literally bleeds oil. There’s an oil rig where her heart is supposed to be
6881 2018-05-05 23:24:45 Thank you Paul, I used to meet up with Peta when I was in Perth, she was a wonderful person, caring and funny. She got on the hash oil to ease the pain and used to get the munchies. That always cracked me up

6886 2018-05-05 23:22:52 This pacific apricot wheat blue moon beer tastes like a blonde bitch tanning with greasy ass oil on a trashy ass beach (aka myrtle) but it’ll have to do
6887 2018-05-05 23:22:48 As comical as it is, the oil isn’t good for the squirrels.
6888 2018-05-05 23:22:44 Let me guess...Dr. Carson’s specialty is Snake Oil.
6889 2018-05-05 23:22:44 Don’t touch. GENTLY wash (no scrubbing) it twice a day with gentle soap (dr bronners baby soap) and pat gently to dry.  Moisturize after cleaning with rigger balm or coconut oil or some fragrance free lotion if oil doesn’t agree with you. Don’t oversaturate. Just moisten.

6893 2018-05-05 23:22:22 #CBD oil is no joke man
6894 2018-05-05 23:22:09 Looks like an oil beetle, genus meloe. Very cool find! I’m not familiar with species-specific ID for this group though.

6896 2018-05-05 23:21:39 The oil boom in the Permian Basin, b/c of fracing, has added only about 3,500 jobs. We r still giving Oil/gas big tax breaks & subsidies. Why?
6897 2018-05-05 23:21:15 New pipelines are for tar sands expansion, NOT to displace oil by rail
6898 2018-05-05 23:21:04 Oil based paint for the win today
6899 2018-05-05 23:20:51 "Has anyone personally used or has their team MD recommended CBD oil for chronic pain instead of NSAIDS?"
6900 2018-05-05 23:20:48 Took the car in today for an oil change, and left with an appointment next Saturday for a $400 brake job. Yeah, my weekend went from zero-to-shit in nothing flat.
6901 2018-05-05 23:20:37 I remember discussing a product exchange; your $39.99 CBD oil for branded organic casualwear of the same value...
6902 2018-05-05 23:20:35 They use peanut oil and I’m allergic so I don’t eat it as much no more but I still eat it .....we all gone die one day
6903 2018-05-05 23:20:24 I guess birds should be ok. Oil is on the pillar which squirrel tries to climb. Just hope it doesn't cause medical problems or impede  any natural functions of its fur coat and skin.

6905 2018-05-05 23:19:57 that's not allowed

there's no olive oil in the picture. you have to make it exactly as the picture shows.
6906 2018-05-05 23:19:29 Yeeesss I can’t wait

6911 2018-05-05 23:18:57 A pollinator is usually defined as either (a) an insect or (b) a plant that has pollen suitable to pollinate another plant of the same species. So one variety of oil seed rape may be a good pollinator for another or if they are self-fertile, good pollinators for themselves.
6912 2018-05-05 23:18:53 I'm coming to visit you, I'm planning it already 
6913 2018-05-05 23:18:50 We've got plenty of oil in Alaska!

6916 2018-05-05 23:17:42 Cannabis oil can be effective in combating cancer, but that alone isn't enough. A change of diet is needed too, no sugar, meat, etc.
6917 2018-05-05 23:17:35 Most people like to just sautee them. Olive oil or butter, maybe throw in some asparagus with them. I personally love them fried lol. Dip them in flour, then egg wash, then more flour or tempura. Fry in oil about 4 minutes on each side.
6918 2018-05-05 23:17:31 i think coconut oil is going to solve all my problems
6919 2018-05-05 23:17:31 Do people actually buy the body oil from the dudes that carry them on bullet belts on the red line?
6920 2018-05-05 23:17:29 First oil change in the s2k 
6921 2018-05-05 23:17:14 Ok, someone help me out here. We are now told we are one of the world’s largest exporter of energy. But if Iran shuts down oil production our fuel prices will go up. So were we or are we not a large exporter. We could just keep our oil and not export any to other countries
6922 2018-05-05 23:17:08 unlike Norway... their oil fields aren't flowing yet. give them 5-7 years w/ Vaca Muerta. can't spend money you don't have today. their sovereign cost of capital too high!!
6923 2018-05-05 23:16:44 Japan soon 
6924 2018-05-05 23:16:35 I also like you guys to think of TML and the Oil, they got the young guns, but no QB to take em to the top. I'd like to #not be stuck in the scenario, plus now the Oil are in cap hell to add to that fact.

If you can get an elite #1 Dman and keep your young core up front-do it!
6925 2018-05-05 23:16:30 Tell where would the oil prices go if Iran take us all out with nuclear missiles. Daaaaaaaa
6926 2018-05-05 23:16:29 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*

6933 2018-05-05 23:15:26 So I read that varnish could make alcohol ink bleed a bit, so I tried to find a way around that because I didn’t want to cover the whole canvas with paint. Tried linseed oil basically as a clear coat. Still bled, but slowly... I’ll update as I learn more from the drying time.

6942 2018-05-05 23:14:12 Indeed, if we had the backbone to go all out for a Green Economy we would pull the teeth on the Russians and Middle-east who rely on Oil. Oil is the dark common denominator in the attack on western democracy internally and externally.
6943 2018-05-05 23:13:55 We peaked at relying on domestic oil in the mid 1970s, its time to stop relying on a 1920s technology.

6956 2018-05-05 23:09:32 You're a democratic socialist if you've ever filled up your vehicle with gasoline:   the oil & gas industry is subsidized, for your benefit, by tens of billions of taxpayer dollars....
6957 2018-05-05 23:09:15 7. Hot Oil Massage - Here is another great tip on how to make your hair thicker and fuller naturally: warm some natural oil like olive or coconut oil (but make sure it’s not too hot and comfortable to touch), and then massage it into your hair and scalp. (Cont)
6958 2018-05-05 23:09:15 There's any amount of oil: problem is the energy cost of extracting it. So we are essentially at Peak Affordable Oil - which is why the Saudis are IPOing Aramco, which they would never do if they saw a a long term upside
6959 2018-05-05 23:08:57 Bread won't bring oil out of the wood. And white mineral oil is food safe and doesn't go rancid, so any small residue getting on bread won't be noticeable and won't matter anyway. And it helps to repel things like tomato juice, blood, etc from soaking into the wood, too!
6960 2018-05-05 23:08:04 CBD oil is excellent.
6961 2018-05-05 23:07:48 @realDonaldTrump Time to oil the wall along the border so it can't be scaled by illegals.  Simple solution.
6962 2018-05-05 23:07:43 Notley had exactly as much influence on oil prices dropping as she’s had on oil prices increasing.  Capital spending in O&G has stalled because of increases in NDP regs, taxes, and inability to move product to market.

6965 2018-05-05 23:07:24 A fine snake oil salesman would know when to quit while ahead. He was adamant he was quitting boxing at 30 to go to Hollywood to be in movies like The Expendables. Now he's broke, knackered, with little to show for it. Sadly Haye even fronted about being a top snake oil salesman
6966 2018-05-05 23:07:08 Busy day. Sold a car and a bulk oil tank
6967 2018-05-05 23:06:39 now I picture seeing that birdfeeder some lady greased up with oil so the squirrels could not climb it lol  was funny to watch them rascals slide to the ground

6972 2018-05-05 23:05:34 If China faces similar supply/price scenario as U.S. did in the 1970's with our Middle East supply, can or does US trade deficit w/China have any redeeming outcome in the oil markets or none at all?
6973 2018-05-05 23:05:19 Yup and yet the safest form of oil transfer is too much typical b.c.
6974 2018-05-05 23:05:18 I found their products to be not worth the price tbh. I found vitamin e oil to be a much better and cheaper treatment for textured skin.

6978 2018-05-05 23:04:40 Shite shite shite. Stupid stomach mad for reasons. I think it’s due to oil from yesterday but gah I hate this damn gas buildup of evil.
6979 2018-05-05 23:04:30 I'd wash the Leadbelcher with Drakenhoff Nightshade / Nuln Oil 1:1 mix (or one thin coat of each) and then use Leadbelcher again as first highlight, followed by Stormhost Silver as a final highlight! 
6980 2018-05-05 23:04:26 Been giving my dog CBD oil for 2 weeks. Seems to give him relief.  unfortunately seems to do nothing for me
6981 2018-05-05 23:03:51 haven't we learned our lesson yet? Jeezzzz what is wrong with these #GOP bully boys - none served, none had family members serve, and yet they want to send everyone else's sons and daughters to wreck havoc - what is it oil, money, land or just screwing up the world?
6982 2018-05-05 23:03:50 It's also used for obfuscating the Peak Oil phenomena.

6989 2018-05-05 23:02:49 I appreciate skin oil a lot more now bc while I didn’t use any sunscreen today I don’t 100% feel like I want to die bc of the sun.. I just didn’t like the actual oily feeling
6990 2018-05-05 23:02:37 So you want Canada to do what Dubai has done --grow super rich from selling oil resources, to the point that we no longer care how much electricity costs, no matter how expensive.

Unfortunately US-funded Greenpeace won't allow us to build even a pipeline. So much for that idea

7003 2018-05-05 23:00:47 The real winners of an US war against Iran would be China (because of a weaker US as a result of the war) and Russia (same as China plus the higher oil prices as a result)

7008 2018-05-05 22:59:48 "If it's super-dried-out, it might just suck the oil right up, so you will want a few applications [of oil]."
7009 2018-05-05 22:59:26 History repeats itself.
We staged a coup to remove the elected PM in 1953
We installed the Shah, creating a dictatorial monarchy.

Why don’t they trust us again?

And of course it was about oil, BP played a big role in the coup.
7010 2018-05-05 22:59:18 "It probably is really dehydrated. I'd use a damp rag to get rid of surface dust, then oil it. Thee only thing is the stains will be harder to get out after oiling, but if you don't care about the stains, no problem."

7014 2018-05-05 22:58:47 You are recklessly depending on propaganda, that are protecting Petrodollar, oil interests, and bringing down Iran and ultimately Russia and China.

7017 2018-05-05 22:58:03 Bullshit.
Oil company, digs up oil, wants to export it.
Sets up hard point distribution networks, branded with their logo, in every major country to sell their much in demand commmodity to public.
Why could exactly same process not happen to beef/lamb?

7019 2018-05-05 22:57:48 "Yeah, that sounds like it would work. You can also buy special oil for cutting boards." (Me: When I worked at IKEA, what we sold for cutting boards was mineral oil.)
7020 2018-05-05 22:57:27 ive been moisturizing w/ pure almond oil with good results lately and i think im gonna try conditioning w/ virgin coconut oil too

whether or not it helps w/ my ends its gonma smell fuckin incredible
7021 2018-05-05 22:57:13 Figure S12 is really cool. Cumulative evaporative losses are pretty similar for most (but not all) collector types after 1 day. Isotopes measured every 4days, and there's a big diff even after the first 4days So, oil def wins for multi-daily to monthly, jury's out on daily.
7022 2018-05-05 22:57:08 Dang the Lucas Oil Stadium for Indy XI looked empty...that’s not good news.
7023 2018-05-05 22:55:59 Yay! Thanks, James! I found this article on oiling cutting boards, which suggests an oil/beeswax mixture.
7024 2018-05-05 22:55:52 all they poll are whites so the % is irrelevant.
7025 2018-05-05 22:55:49 He doesn't see any problem with that. He doesn't think mineral oil would be a problem, but doesn't think not oiling it would be fatal or anthing.
7026 2018-05-05 22:55:41 Norway not a socialist country. Has private investment & ownership. Anyway why is Norway so rich? Because they ruthlessly extract natural resources, ruthlessly compete in the global market, they out compete those around them. But a tanker or pipeline full of Norway oil is OK?

7028 2018-05-05 22:55:31 yeah almond oil is more for the hair,, i feel you my skin was doing good and then a few weeks ago it fucked up. i use this moisturiser called aveeno it makes your skin so soft

7035 2018-05-05 22:54:51 1/ QE liquidity flowed into 'inflation hedging' passive/index commodity funds causing the very inflation they aimed to avoid. 2/ Smart Obama resilience policy was to maintain oil prices at levels enabling shale oil to be funded via petrodollar Treasury reserves & QE liquidity
7036 2018-05-05 22:54:38 Trump has PUT OUR LANDMARKS FOR SALE! He’s even supported pollution and oil drilling. Our environment is at a RISK. You can claim whatever you want. I on the other hand? I know what’s the right side of history is. I’m done with you people degrading those who disagree with you.
7037 2018-05-05 22:54:37 "Yeah. Then sand it or don't, and then oil it."
7038 2018-05-05 22:54:36 Most should be fine as long as it’s not in direct heat like on a frying pan.  You can use your oil and blend it in with a butter. Then cook with it
7039 2018-05-05 22:54:26 Their plan seems to be burn all the oil, raise the seas, destroy the crops, make millions flee for their lives, cause global chaos and provoke the Flame Deluge. Musk is at least trying to get a few million people in space before that inevitably goes down.
7040 2018-05-05 22:54:24 She sold off the family gold & silver to her free market friends! Now we own nothing! We could have had a sovereign wealth fund, from oil sales like the Norwegians.
7041 2018-05-05 22:54:21 No oil
7042 2018-05-05 22:54:16 As an American,  you wouldn't understand the oil and gas industry in NEBC or Alberta tho.
Or the people that work in or those that don't work in the industry. 
So off you go with your American propaganda and trolling. 
Your not wanted here by the majority of Canadians.
7043 2018-05-05 22:53:50 Be a shame if someone accidentally spilled some mineral oil on the opponents lanes, wink-wink, nudge-nudge.
7044 2018-05-05 22:53:49 I don't recall the US being invited into Iraq, Syria or Afghanistan. You invaded Iraq under false pretenses (no WMD), took their oil, destroyed their infrastructure, and ISIS filled the vacuum. Such amazing foreign policy.
7045 2018-05-05 22:53:25 "She could probably also get away with just sanding it and not doing anything to it oil-wise. Might want to do that if bread will be rising in it. Otherwise, I'd sand it (optional) and apply mineral oil."

7049 2018-05-05 22:52:53 It’s almost as if oil never comes off.
7050 2018-05-05 22:52:33 Omg same....I wasnt too worried because they weren't coming to my state
7051 2018-05-05 22:52:31 "Olive oil goes rancid; mineral oil doesn't. Mineral oil is generally harmless other than being a mild laxative, but usually isn't an issue if you wipe it off really really really well. If the oil goes rancid, it's over."
7052 2018-05-05 22:52:11 80s for me anyway..it was brilliant..one page Tour De France..next Turkish oil Wrestling for 2 days duration..the point was the Appetite was there unlike todat where its overload

7068 2018-05-05 22:49:57 The alternative hypothesis is that the difference can largely be attributed to Alberta’s oil and gas deposits.
7069 2018-05-05 22:49:54 Sure, because we all know that there's no money in the oil industry.
7070 2018-05-05 22:49:41 Nope. Completely false.

It really boils down to Page, then Cohan negotiating the Rosneft Oil deal where the 3 of them got 19% of the stock to end sanctions, most to Trump. That's worth billions to Trump. Muelli is following the money.
7101 2018-05-05 22:44:55 This type of talent proofs again and again how resilient Nigerians are, nigerian youths are, even Nigerian teenagers are... they don't necessarily wait for oil money to make a living, they just hustle at / with anything and everything at their disposal. #BuhariLazyYouths
7102 2018-05-05 22:44:51 So is NASCAR a money laundering path for oil companies?
7103 2018-05-05 22:44:39 What is on the ball, Celtics dribbling it like it got baby oil on it. And how does Simmons pick up the ball with Larkin guarding him?
7104 2018-05-05 22:44:30 trade with muders ?  The USA has supported dictators for the past 200 years. Iran used to be out friend when the oil  price was right so was osama bin laden and saddam hussiem We only killed 10 million in veitnam so i guess we are the good guys
7105 2018-05-05 22:44:26 Is it me or do all TA service centers had so much oil on the floor that it is a slip hazard?
7106 2018-05-05 22:44:25 I’ve started using a peppermint essential oil roll-on for my headaches and I want to know why I had never done this before. This thing is a lifesaver.

7113 2018-05-05 22:43:13 Oh. What oil do Thais use?
7114 2018-05-05 22:42:07 Has anyone used CBD oil to help with their anxiety? Did it have any effect (is it worth trying out)?
7115 2018-05-05 22:42:05 Agreed. Where Enron fooled creditors & investors via opaque prepay funding (70% of their income over 10 years never existed), US, a couple of banks & oil companies have fooled the oil market for well over a decade
7116 2018-05-05 22:42:02 Connecting the price of oil to quantitative easing policies, rather than to regular investment-led suppy/demand cycles is another misinformed (or even slightly paranoid) analysis of the economic impact (or absence thereof) of the policy
7117 2018-05-05 22:41:46 Just played an absolute blinder, lads: in a late night fridge forage, turned bland oven chips into rosemary salted fries, topped with feta, olive oil and black pepper 
7118 2018-05-05 22:41:03 #WARNING: #Tsunami is heading to #Hawaii thanks to them and their man-made #Earthquakes such as offshore drilling, the oil industries (even if they "banned" fracking just know that the oil industry is still around), they do secret drilling underground for "research programs"
7119 2018-05-05 22:40:54 For It not to contain palm oil.
7120 2018-05-05 22:40:20 Investors should be very worried about you. Hopefully the SEC steps in and exposes you for the snake oil salesman you are.
7121 2018-05-05 22:40:17 So are the majority of citizens. There are mobsters and war mongers in our house . What do they want ? Oil and world domination.

7123 2018-05-05 22:40:10 No palm oil.
7124 2018-05-05 22:40:07 Small propblem Nature is already pumping billions of bbls of oil into the ocean. The issue is environmentalists driving  cars..... and  using diesel boats - think on that

7126 2018-05-05 22:39:49 The liberal parasites destroy the Alberta oil industry but still expect billions of transfer payments from Alberta. They give this money to Toyota!!! Alberta patriots it is time for us to leave parasite Canada.
7127 2018-05-05 22:39:41 I never celebrate cinco de mayo but now I'm going to.
7128 2018-05-05 22:39:41 Nah! They usually cook it in this garlicky oil and season it well so it’s got hella flavor and you eat the whole thing. The meat ends up really soft too
7129 2018-05-05 22:39:21 I'm painting some of the stain black on my chair because the oil paint stain won't come off shshshsbsbsbsbsbsbsbs
7130 2018-05-05 22:39:16 Oops, I meant to write CBD "Hemp" oil. There are cannabinoid receptors in our skin and hemp oil is very nutrient rich. I believe our skin reacts to the CBD and helps us absorb more of the vitamins and minerals in the hemp oil.
7131 2018-05-05 22:39:09 I thought I needed the rush, but there was never enough
Cause all I needed was some coconut oil
Don't worry about the small things, I know I can do all things
Mama always told me that and she was right
7132 2018-05-05 22:38:57 There relentless,I use vegetable oil.
7133 2018-05-05 22:38:55 They work past this defence but you can put spicy pepper infused oil or peppermint infused oil on it. That can delay them even longer. I like to shoot water with peppermint essential oil at them. They HATE that.
7134 2018-05-05 22:38:55 I got this new body oil that I’ve gotten so many compliments on today.. 

It’s called Vick’s Vapor Rub. Makes you smell just like a peppermint

7137 2018-05-05 22:38:44 The rest of the world is getting ahead of us on everything while the oil Barron’s rein supreme here.  Sad
7138 2018-05-05 22:38:36 This can be reveresed ward by ward if Oil and Gas gave free energy to the NHS and paid for the legal fees from litigation and standard administration....  Time for Oil and Gas to be more socially responsible.
7139 2018-05-05 22:38:24 Seriously. Some of these oils like palm and vegetable oil is poison.
7140 2018-05-05 22:38:19 I thought I needed to run and find somebody to love
But all I needed was some coconut oil
Don't worry about the small things, I know I can do all things
Mama always told me it would be alright
7141 2018-05-05 22:38:19 I am so so sorry. Is CBD oil an option you’ve looked into already?
7142 2018-05-05 22:38:07 Platinum is a lot more common in space than oil is on earth...
7143 2018-05-05 22:37:52 That’s not gon fix this oil leak lol
7144 2018-05-05 22:37:26 That's not a problem according to JT and Notey. But oil pipelines are such a bad thing!

7146 2018-05-05 22:37:23 Are you in the keep it in the ground camp Rob? I am incredibly proud of the oil and gas sector and the lifestyle it affords us. Our high quality of life in Alberta is something that we should celebrate.

7152 2018-05-05 22:36:20 Kitty managed to get herself caught in the bedsheets and stress-farted... Luckily my oil burner is taking care of it and sending calming anise smells to compensate.
7153 2018-05-05 22:36:07 Why are we still in Iraq putting soldiers lives in danger? We got Saddam years ago. Bring them home. Oh yeah forgot that region including Afghanistan has oil, minerals, resources, and opium that we need.
7154 2018-05-05 22:35:37 I think I'd put oil on it just for the entertainment value alone...bahahaha...it's hilarious...

7158 2018-05-05 22:35:07 Coconut oil is the devil. Idc idc. Except for hair care. But for skin.... it’s a no for me.
7159 2018-05-05 22:34:48 Foreign oil interests hire people to protest Canadian oil so they can kill competition. Idiot Canadians buy the bullshit and put fellow Canadians out of work to clear their conscience. It’s a fake agenda - the market will dictate thd future.  Make affordable “clean” cars...
7160 2018-05-05 22:34:45 No frickin' palm oil.

7166 2018-05-05 22:33:24 Interesting! I’m not a big Mary Jane smoker personally but I am so so so fascinated by it and the medicinal properties. And I love my CBD oil. I would pay a premium for an organic oil. And I think it would be good to know!
7167 2018-05-05 22:33:18 Let’s buy our oil from shithole countries that shoot people for all crimes or behead in front of families  get a grip or give up your car and phone and computer and I’ll join you
7168 2018-05-05 22:33:16 Being rich in vitamin E, Olive Oil can help your eyebrow hair grow faster and thicker. It will also help keep it dark-hued. Massage your eyebrows with warm olive oil for 5 minutes before going to bed. Leave it on overnight, then rinse it off with warm water the next morning.
7169 2018-05-05 22:32:54 It’s so awesome to see City of Hughson cleaning up their town and recycling used oil. Our Haz Mat guys filled up four 55 gallon barrels of used oil and a bucket of used oil filters. Way to go Hughson residents!!!
7170 2018-05-05 22:32:47 Oil
7171 2018-05-05 22:32:33 It's how I used to get my daughter to sleep... warm bath .  Gentle massage with lavender baby oil..  slept whole night from 6 weeks old. 
7172 2018-05-05 22:32:26 On this particular day i couldn't hold it anymore the difference between a mad man and i was -0.1, i had to run to my dad to pray for me after eating plenty raw garri, man gave me crude oil and that was how i escaped madness and death that day.

7174 2018-05-05 22:32:05 Oil and grease are so-so deterrents. My mother always preferred BBs, which tend to be permanent if used well.
7175 2018-05-05 22:31:43 Psa...your coconut oil is coconut broth now. Reach responsibly
7176 2018-05-05 22:31:37 Not really. Head looked fine. But somehow oil gets in the combustion chamber(s?).. so there must be a crack somewhere, I guess.

7179 2018-05-05 22:30:58 Oil up -> EV sales up -> oil demand down -> oil down. Negative feedback loop

7184 2018-05-05 22:29:47 子が増えるとどうしても上の子も下の子もこういう気持ちができてしまうから、先日の「母の愛情が分散して目減りする分、他の兄弟からも愛情をもらっている話」がモヤモヤしたのかな。愛情じゃなく、単純に「母親が自分を見てくれている時間」が欲しいんだよなぁ。
7185 2018-05-05 22:29:36 Yes try Bcomplex, fish oil, calm oils like lavender, geranium. Alkaline water to balance out your ph. And working out. I took myself off the same meds you mentioned. I was on it for 9 months , also take epsom salt baths to calm you it has magnesium in it.
7186 2018-05-05 22:29:21 can you remind me How did Turkey buy Oil from Terrorists? Can it remind how Turkey uses children for propaganda? And Islam is allowed to use children?

Why is he on reddit at 2am? Why is there cloth on the altar when the church is closed? And: WHY DID HE USE THE OIL OF CHRISM?
7189 2018-05-05 22:29:03 Why don’t Doctors recommend “black  seed oil” to cancer patients? It kills off bad cancer.

7192 2018-05-05 22:28:43 I'd love to own an electric vehicle. But even at 60,000 km per year and gas at $1.40/litre, a Chevy #Bolt can barely pencil out vs comparable-sized car. Basically saves the value of oil changes over life of vehicle

7199 2018-05-05 22:27:49 James: Yeah, water will definitely crack it. Oil is probably her best bet; depends on what's wrong with it. Standard procedure: sand it to get rid of stains, etc., then oil, but is it cracked?
7200 2018-05-05 22:27:31 Enjoyed this article Mark. I do think oil is heading to levels over $80, war (or threat of) with Iran looks more and more likely. Next couple of weeks looks very interesting with Nuclear Deal set to expire.
7201 2018-05-05 22:27:25 Roofs and hot water heaters and plumbing in general, oil tanks... it sucks, all of it. I'm happy to be renting again for a few years.

7217 2018-05-05 22:22:42 And you who such that to compare the person with an animal? You yourself who have renewed why you are silent about how your oil bought from terrorists?
7218 2018-05-05 22:22:17 That is waaaaay scary looking ole ride. I rode in one from fort to Conway and back. The engine burned 2 quarts of oil and a gallon of water. Topped out at 50 miles an hour. Wild ride on the passenger side. Door open all the way.
7219 2018-05-05 22:21:55 Girl try some rose hipseed oil! I’ve been using it for a few months now and it works great! I got mine from Sephora for like $10
7220 2018-05-05 22:21:46 That's regime change for you Pearson, all the profit is in the rebuild contracts - oh and the arms sales, and the oil.
7221 2018-05-05 22:21:45 NDDC IS DOING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, THEY'RE BUSY STEALING OUR MONEY WHILE THE OIL PRODUCING COMMUNITIES LIKE BENEKU,NDOKWA EAST, DELTA STATE WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM THE DIRECT EFFECT OF OIL EXPLORATION ARE LEFT UNDEVELOPED. NO NDDC  PROJECT FOUND.
7222 2018-05-05 22:21:38 With gas prices at $6.50 a gallon? Do you see the problem here Dianne?

Double the fuel economy, double the fuel price and nothing changes. Open up competition in oil refinery and the prices drop. More people travel and see these national parks you’re so proud of.
7223 2018-05-05 22:21:36 @sunriseon7 You must be kidding! Try and use your brain to work out snake oil sales pitches from actual truth! If seaweed was good for coating your nasal passages, why wouldn’t you spray it in your mouth as well #rubbish

7226 2018-05-05 22:20:58 We don’ want to leave it too long or there won’t be anything left. I don’t mean OIL. It’ll be a busted flush in energy terms soon.  Water and renewables as well as fresh air and quality of life are the real jewels in Scotland’s crown
7227 2018-05-05 22:20:56 I was in abhudhabi airport in 2015, really big one and under construction.

7231 2018-05-05 22:20:28 We can work a deal, I own a 1995 Dodge Ram 1500 with over 300000 miles. The engine has never been opened and burns no oil. I will give you mine in exchange for a red one. Ask me why.
7232 2018-05-05 22:20:23 I forecast late 2011 with oil at $110/bbl price would go to $45/$50 per bbl when QE ended. It did. Price has been routinely macro manipulated since 2004 via Brent complex. I recommended a Transatlantic enquiry to UK Treasury Select Committee in July 2008. Pity they didn't do it

7241 2018-05-05 22:19:07 Put some good coconut oil in your hair
7242 2018-05-05 22:19:03 My little sister put me on to Vitamin E oil from Trader Joe’s as my facial moisturizer and it has revolutionized my facial regimen. 17 y/o putting me on lol
7243 2018-05-05 22:19:00 石油だってオリーブオイルだって変わらぬオイルだ。だからみんな、資源は大切に使おう。
7244 2018-05-05 22:18:59 Excuses, excuses.

We aren’t talking about 1500 years ago.

We’re talking about the US, UK, Saudi Arabia and others starting wars because there is oil there and we want it. When we are told no, we don’t like it.

Libya wanted to go off the gold standard. Time to remove Kaddafi.
7245 2018-05-05 22:18:57 They’ll be sweeping everyone off to Gravesend if this gets any worse. Horrific turn of fortune for the lead free, down with oil consumption lot. Although saying that, it is almost fully spring and the leaves are beginning to bloom, so not all is lost, as yet anyway.
7246 2018-05-05 22:18:38 Lev2:6  Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meat offering.  #BibleVerse
7247 2018-05-05 22:18:16 Ouuuuuuu not the oil  lawdddddd finna be tore up 
7248 2018-05-05 22:18:04 This is true the number one cause of death of American Indian women is murder 1-39 yrs and it is mostly kidnapping sexual assault and murder by oil pipeline workers another reason tribes want the man camps gone of oil workers. The pipelines bring crime with the mancamps
7249 2018-05-05 22:18:03 Not everyone works in oil and gas.
7250 2018-05-05 22:17:33 The reason we pay such high prices for gas; the Fed & Prov gov have become "tax drunk" on the revenues, they recieve from gas prices. They allow the oil companies to charge whatever they choose.
7251 2018-05-05 22:17:31 I love how the lady being interviewed handled that InfoWars "reporter."

On a serious note, something the anti-socialism crowd leaves out about Venezuela is how the country's economy was built upon oil.
7252 2018-05-05 22:17:27 The right wing all over the western world have been working together against the Left. From Putin to Bibi to the Tory T. May to D. Trump to Brexit and the GOP Tax Scam to Big Oil to the Middle East and the military industrial complex. When are people going to recognize it?
7253 2018-05-05 22:17:18 I do a pampering night. A nice hot bath with salts and essential oil. A good book and maybe either tea or homemade Kombucha. Relaxing music with no words so my thoughts don’t run around and I can focus in the moment. Also a good stroll with the stars on a clear night. #selflove

7255 2018-05-05 22:16:55 Do it yourself Oil change and put on all season tires now my diesel truck is ready for the spring 
7256 2018-05-05 22:16:54 Gold is recycled, Silver is recycled. Oil is abundant. Mankind did not kill the dinosaurs. It is the circle of life. The societies who are the most responsible stewards of the environment are not communist countries, they are free market countries.
7257 2018-05-05 22:16:40 He's a great influence on our young people. Berates police, sucks at football and had no desire to work his way back into the league because he's lazy, his muslim girlfriend pays his way through with her hajee oil money. Let's glorify the scumbag.
7258 2018-05-05 22:16:28 NDDC IS DOING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, THEY'RE BUSY STEALING OUR MONEY WHILE THE OIL PRODUCING COMMUNITIES LIKE BENEKU WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM THE DIRECT EFFECT OF OIL EXPLORATION ARE LEFT UNDEVELOPED. GOD WILL SURELY JUDGE YOU

7263 2018-05-05 22:15:12 Why do I get through this face oil so quickly???? It’s like I drink it
7264 2018-05-05 22:15:09 Is boiled sweet potatoes an omega 3 fish oil?
7265 2018-05-05 22:15:03 Everyone involved in #HayeBellew2 as a PPV was selling snake oil. Boxing community hype, nothing else. Haye is injury ravaged & boxing on one leg. He was leaning in over his front foot, no speed, no timing relying on landing a Hail Mary. Sitting duck 
7266 2018-05-05 22:14:35 They aren't reasonable. They aren't effective. They are infringements. They will not be accepted. Have a good day.
7267 2018-05-05 22:14:29 IMF says Saudi's need $87 a barrel to cover their yearly budget expenses. Ford is not producing cars anymore. We will bail them out in next 5 years so they can produce them again. Lower the CAFE standards.  Between tariffs and oil we are head towards a recession.  AMERICA FIRST!

7270 2018-05-05 22:13:22 Did not Turkey support when the United States bombed Syria, did not Turkey use children to propagate against Assad, did not Turkey transport oil through Syria?
7271 2018-05-05 22:13:17 The other dropper bottle came in (bought it a week or so after the second one) can finally make the body oil/ highlighter I planned on making. (Didn't want to use foundation for my whole body.)
7272 2018-05-05 22:13:10 I'd like to respond to that sarcastically: Yes, I relish the thought of a stranger covering my body with oil and rubbing it.
7273 2018-05-05 22:13:03 Same ones whine lazy lefties never work, only collect welfare while they work so hard & pay for the rest of us. Back in my hippies days I worked the booms on oil salvage off the coast, forest fire fighting crews & planted trees. Did more work in 1 day than whiny cons in a month
7274 2018-05-05 22:13:01 I filled up oil in my lawn mower. I remembered how not to be an IDIOT. Thanks @Richzeoli
7275 2018-05-05 22:12:58 A labor union enables a lot of officials to live off the work of real workers.
The officials become a class by themselves.
They look out for themselves & NOT for labor.
— Upton Sinclair, Oil
7276 2018-05-05 22:12:56 Huh, I probably should’ve gotten an oil change today.
7277 2018-05-05 22:12:52 This is what happens when you refuse to use oil on an indoor slip n slide
7278 2018-05-05 22:12:42 I'm still waiting for the prince of nigeria, Dr Njumbobongolululzah to give me my "$121.9 million US dollor" *payable in oil fields
7279 2018-05-05 22:12:34 @DevinNunes is a traitor and should be charged with interference of an investigation. He is the leaker and feeds the W.H DOJ intel to the criminal president we have in office. #DonTheCon the snake oil salesman.
7280 2018-05-05 22:12:31 Reasonable and effective regulations means revoking rights and confiscating property? Go back to school. Take reading.
7281 2018-05-05 22:12:25 Where is that man? Agha Waqar? He was doing something and he is vanished..... Never challenge a mafia and he was challenging oil mafia.
7282 2018-05-05 22:12:18 #aye read about cbd oil E
7283 2018-05-05 22:12:13 Cocunut oil is liquid, and I put it right in the freezer. I wasn't ready.
7284 2018-05-05 22:12:11 What about gold? What about silver? Oil? Explain the extinction of plants and animals caused by mankind’s greed.
7285 2018-05-05 22:12:00 It says oil but in my heart I want to believe they meant shortening so it's an actual dip-like texture...
7286 2018-05-05 22:11:47 year after year, the conservatives in alberta mismanaged the $. that’s why they were thrown out. the spigot of $ was turned off. 

i’ve been listening to sobbing of wounded albertans for decades. it’s like a broken record. 

oil under the ground in one place, like you earned it.
7287 2018-05-05 22:11:43 Eba and red oil
7288 2018-05-05 22:11:02 Nationalizing the oil industry in Iraq & Iran, admittedly, would have diminished US global power, but it would have meant a more prosperous and peaceful Middle-East. Your public role is based on ignorance of the CIA's history
7289 2018-05-05 22:11:00 I feel you; but have no answers.  I use cannabis oil sometimes for sleep
7290 2018-05-05 22:10:57 The hard working people in front of me just bought that first of the month grocery haul meanwhile I’m buying liquor, coconut oil, tide pods and water. #thotlife
7291 2018-05-05 22:10:32 One of the most memorable scenes to me is the episode on that prison oil rig when reddington has the shotgun, that whole sequence

7295 2018-05-05 22:09:55 Don't forget @NancyPelosi promised to raise taxes and @MaxineWaters promised impeachment.  Seems like winner winner chicken dinner!
7296 2018-05-05 22:09:49 So my back is sore for yesterday’s tire change on my car, my legs from this morning’s long run on the mountain and my hands are burned from a splatter of boiling oil on half a dozen spots.

Awesome day so far….

7301 2018-05-05 22:09:29 Do Jamaican black castor oil really work for thickening up thin spots in your hair?  
7302 2018-05-05 22:09:22 This is the Trump economy. He’ll blame Obama but Trump and republicans have trashed everything Obama did. Big oil is happy republicans have control. Profits at record highs and no one cares about gas prices
7303 2018-05-05 22:09:18 Ain’t no oil point on that but 
7304 2018-05-05 22:09:09 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
7305 2018-05-05 22:09:07 Bryson done turned into a single black woman…got his own place, red wine and oil diffusers 
7306 2018-05-05 22:09:05 It’s oil ... the profit margins on it drive this entire section of history
7307 2018-05-05 22:08:54 The UK will have to follow EU regulations in any area it wants to trade with the EU. So if Scotland is part of the EU, rUK will have to follow our regulations if it wants to trade with us.
We'll use the currency people buy our oil and electricity in.
7308 2018-05-05 22:08:49 Oil more profitable than catsup?
7309 2018-05-05 22:08:40 Also try the magnolia oil it has vitamin e oil which is good for scars and stretch marks

7314 2018-05-05 22:08:17 Musk is super capable only at snake oil salesmanship. seriously.
7315 2018-05-05 22:08:11 Exxon is definitely extremely invested in finding an alternative to oil, I believe you, commerical.
7316 2018-05-05 22:08:06 todos le echan la culpa a hugo chavez y a maduro,pero las broncas de venexuela vienen desde muuuucho tempo atras y pues uno de los paises mas ricos en petroleo,que casualidad no? que alguien externo cause broncas en venezuela para perjudicarlos y quedarse  con el petroleo
7317 2018-05-05 22:08:02 I got my car that is 10 years old when I bought few years ago (2007 Nissan Sentra)- expected spent $$$ such as new tires, battery, new parts on muffler and other minor issues. Be sure you change oil filter in every 3,000 miles. Once good take care of car and you will be all good.
7318 2018-05-05 22:07:59 Did i hear you say your countryman? Why then do you people sing the song of one Nigeria when deep inside you all know we're not one. Oh, i know why?....South south oil, the reason for the forced marriage.
7319 2018-05-05 22:07:58 Oh yeah- totally don't trust those BS;;

I saw this guide on natural way to remove cavity with a certain oil and I think a someone ended up getting rotten tooth in the end. The actual purpose for for oil pulling/rinsing was twisted from the origin.
7320 2018-05-05 22:07:54 Same
7321 2018-05-05 22:07:49 You a real sad child, huh?
At least throw some cheese on there if you can't stand beans/rice/lettuce.

The oil in the cheese makes the meat taste better, don't do this to yourself
7322 2018-05-05 22:07:14 Rusev. What are your feelings on coconut oil?
7323 2018-05-05 22:06:54 When I was a kid, there was no such thing as sunblock. In high school, we’d mix iodine with baby oil and smear it on ourselves.  No telling what damage that caused.
7324 2018-05-05 22:06:41 Yes, that is what it says.
7325 2018-05-05 22:06:24 ye, i just dont like avis like that. they look too generic and is just a stock with oil paint used on it
7326 2018-05-05 22:06:15 I need an essential oil massage real bad.
7327 2018-05-05 22:06:10 A note for restaurants: If you fry your vegetarian food in the same oil as all your meat, it’s no longer suitable for vegetarians. So don’t put a sign next to it saying it’s ‘suitable for vegetarians’.
7328 2018-05-05 22:06:08 Psalm 45:7

You love righteousness and hate wickedness;
Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You
With the oil of gladness more than Your companions.
7329 2018-05-05 22:06:02 Petroleum is an outdated resource. The tar sands produce some of the dirtiest oil in the world. Emissions are astronomical, the volume of water use is through the roof and you are part of an anti science corporate propaganda machine. #cdnpoli #StopKM
7330 2018-05-05 22:05:56 Really? The snake oil guy?
7331 2018-05-05 22:05:53 Clinton does it, you call him Untrustworthy. Trump does it and much much more and you say it’s his personal business. You’re a hypocrite. You know nothing of God. You’re just another snake oil salesman. Take your prayers somewhere else.

7335 2018-05-05 22:04:38 Turkey is helping Syria and why they did not help before Russia came in. Did not Turkey transport oil through Syria?
7336 2018-05-05 22:04:33 Dear Ankit,why r u guys burning your mid night oil and worried about Bajwa doctrine? Is it due to the reason that despite your all out efforts, you have failed to achieve your nepharious designs through militancy. Concentrate towards making toilets in India than to worry abt Pak.

7342 2018-05-05 22:03:50 Now time to figure out where the oil is coming from, a s is it oil or power steering fluid? There is always a oily substance on the snorkel tube, and I always wipe it off every time I check the oil.

7367 2018-05-05 21:59:20 Lmfao the people who broke into my house were obviously very young and dumb because they apparently stole a bottle of olive oil thinking it was BOOZE!!!!
7368 2018-05-05 21:58:38 Good point. I’m not sure about the %, but oil is extracted from, say Venezuela, made into plastic in China & shipped to and consumed in the USA. This isn’t about countries so much as it is about waste...as I tap on my cell phone. #WeCollude.

7381 2018-05-05 21:56:18 We’re gonna need both. Trees or bio energy crops are cheaper for now, but land is limited. DAC using waste heat and excess renewable power will be able to scale up to the size of the oil+gas industry, which is what we’ll need.
7382 2018-05-05 21:56:02 Had a ‘minor’ freak out bc I went outside and saw spiders all over my deck & hornets taking over my bee house so I decided to make a homemade essential oil killer/repellent & use it excessively until it was gone. So now I’m sure my neighbors think I’m doing some weird voodoo shit
7383 2018-05-05 21:55:11 I really got mayo, eggs & olive oil in my hair 
7384 2018-05-05 21:54:44 Mine was getting costly to keep running. Timing chain was getting very noisy and it needed a new cat. Turbo seals were buggered so it drank oil...
7385 2018-05-05 21:54:42 And how does boycotting palm oil help? In general, deforestation is the issue, not the rapid removal of ONE specific plant... I agree with your desire for solar power, that is essential, but your other two statements are a bit more troublesome
7386 2018-05-05 21:54:34 Better to shop in Iceland if possible only store that recently announced it no longer sources Palm Oil that is destroying rain forests and the great Apes.
7387 2018-05-05 21:54:25 They drained my transmission fluid instead of my oil. When I drove away my car didn’t even make it out of the parking lot before it just wouldn’t go anywhere
7388 2018-05-05 21:53:46 How about people in “other countries” killed by feeding the capitalist machine; from sweat shops, to conflict diamonds/oil, to environmental poisoning.

Preventable deaths due to lack of access to healthcare (US), and adequate winter heating (UK/US) can be added to the tally.
7389 2018-05-05 21:53:32 if you believe the U.S. is no longer going to be the leading world economic power, then betting on the U.S. dollar to maintain it's global buying power is a bad idea. As oil and energy in general is able to be bought on world markets in other denominations of exchange.
7390 2018-05-05 21:53:25 “Oil is bipolar” 
“You mean non polar?”
“Bipolar, non polar, same thing”
7391 2018-05-05 21:52:58 “offshore energy”
Offshore energy is great. You can build those wind parks out at see, nobody can’t hear the wind turbines, you hardly see th…

Oh, they mean oil drilling. 
7392 2018-05-05 21:52:41 Will you won the internet today my friend. No doubt about it. #MAGA
7393 2018-05-05 21:51:57 Assumption may need to offer Home Ec classes.  Whilie studing at Tinsley, a couple of students decided to heat oil in a pan in the Kitchen.  Let's just say I had to relocate and the Fire Trucks are on the way.  Only during finals week.
7394 2018-05-05 21:51:52 Nobama in my white house (keep in mind, my house is painted white)! The 1% invented glider-capes that they won’t share with anyone else! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
7395 2018-05-05 21:51:32 But real talk, CBD oil is life. It helps me focus soooo much better and curbs my anxiety
7396 2018-05-05 21:51:24 Greece
7397 2018-05-05 21:51:19 I literally bath in coconut oil lol
7398 2018-05-05 21:51:03 I never knew they did oil changes. What happened?
7399 2018-05-05 21:50:47 Omgggg they should warn people of their peanut oil usage. As a company I’m surprised they haven’t been sensitive to people with peanut allergies
7400 2018-05-05 21:50:38 I'd like to know when people will wake up and realize that the NRA doesn't give a damn about gun rights. Just like Big Pharma or Big Oil, they are a lobbyist group and at the end of the day, it comes down to the money. It's and endless greed cycle.
7401 2018-05-05 21:50:26 I do it to keep ants out of my hummingbird feeder. Just a lil veg oil low on the pole. No harm.
7402 2018-05-05 21:50:06 Your MCM uses cooking oil in his beard
7403 2018-05-05 21:49:51 y'all full of oil.. why gas expensive in canada?

7408 2018-05-05 21:48:55 i’d like to stop palm oil
7409 2018-05-05 21:48:54 I just need my oil changed g 
7410 2018-05-05 21:48:33 Whipped shea butter and coconut oil has been awesome for my skin. Now to add a vit c serum for my face
7411 2018-05-05 21:48:04 My @3BLforLiving CBD Oil is always in my bag! But I also don’t leave home without the pain balm. It’s EVERYTHING.
7412 2018-05-05 21:47:58 Idk why I didn’t hop on this rosehip oil train sooner I been missing out
7413 2018-05-05 21:47:39 Y’all think Retail customers are bad? Try dealing with customers in the oil field industry. Imagine a person rushing you out of your OT money
7414 2018-05-05 21:47:28 Depending on the size of the dog I'd say a tablespoon of olive oil on the kibbles every day will help: with reg grooming
7415 2018-05-05 21:47:19 Your annual reminder that hydraulic oil still tastes like shit
7416 2018-05-05 21:47:11 You pump oil.
7417 2018-05-05 21:46:22 I think the problem is that the oils they were originally treated with were probably not environmentally friendly. Used engine oil etc. 
Teak oil would help preserve them, I don’t know what it would do for the patina.
7418 2018-05-05 21:46:20 This is killing me. Some species will never recover from this. In ONE short year, so many habitats and precious US monuments destroyed. I hear all it takes is a phone call to Trump and it's a done deal. Offshore oil drilling, fracking, you name it!
7419 2018-05-05 21:45:51 Inbox: What makes the Prague F5 "extremely powerful"?

Those big oil storage tanks like dot the fields around Cushing? It tore an entire battery of them apart and tossed the shells like whiffle balls.
7420 2018-05-05 21:45:34 If we make all new cars plug in electric we 50 miles of electric range we can reduce oil consumption by 90% i’d rather spend money for electricity made from solar and wind here in United States instead of buying oil from parts of the world that would love to destroy US
7421 2018-05-05 21:45:28 Absolute tosh! Europe as you say has already stated no problem with Scotland getting membership.  Put in a Holden pen type situation and fast  tracked.  White paper was based on oil figures predicted by oecd as were UK figures.  UK wad higher than the snp white paper.  Tick tock
7422 2018-05-05 21:45:24 try coconut oil ! sometimes it takes smth more gentle to remove makeup 
7423 2018-05-05 21:45:12 Love Peru. But also, Spain and the UK (especially Scotland).
7424 2018-05-05 21:45:11 THIS CAR STINKS LIKE OIL. BETTER TRY TO FIX IT WITH MY FARTS AND ASS STANK. *moans involentarily*
7425 2018-05-05 21:44:57 Sun burnt like a bitch and I only put a tiny bit of baby oil on 
7426 2018-05-05 21:44:56 Argon oil gives my hair so much love
7427 2018-05-05 21:44:55 never knew how good olive oil was til today
7428 2018-05-05 21:44:46 The smell of toasted sesame oil... 
7429 2018-05-05 21:44:35 Heh
7430 2018-05-05 21:44:35 Ha! Money to burn! Yikes on the socialist team stuff. I hope that’s tongue in cheek. Oil? Bring your money, join the culture you find. It’s pretty good in the West, which is why you’re here
7431 2018-05-05 21:44:27 BENTONITE CLAY MASKS, TEA TREE OIL, APPLE CUDER VINEGAR, ROSEHIP OIL, THE WHOLE SHIT
7432 2018-05-05 21:44:26 I've tried so many products & nothing really kept working. Kinda get better than get worse. I use all natural products now & tea tree oil & my skin has been consistent for a few years :)
7433 2018-05-05 21:44:25 No, Scotland wants to keep NHS free but funded by Westminster because you can’t generate enough tax to pay for it on your own Luv. Krankie Sturgeon is all for herself. Go on stay in the EU ( but you can’t afford it anyway ) and you’re stuffed when the oil runs dry! #BuildAWall
7434 2018-05-05 21:44:15 "Apple and Amazon are worth more than the entire S&P 500 energy sector". 
No One believes oil will trade over 100 bucks again. 
Heck no one believes it will stay at 70, or 60 even. Hence energy sector pricing.
I have thought and continue to think that is spectacularly wrong.
7435 2018-05-05 21:44:13 I thinkw e need a periscope of you actually saying this.
7436 2018-05-05 21:44:07 I'm definitely trying the oil next. 
7437 2018-05-05 21:43:50 I don’t trust Zinke.  They want to cut red tape,  which protects the Parks’s.  Sending the superintendent of Yellowstone  to DC.  Doesn’t sound like getting him closer to “resources”, but more like a death sentence.  I’m pretty sure Oil, Gas and Mining access is what they want.

7440 2018-05-05 21:42:39 I stepped in gum and it sucked but then I stepped in oil and it dissolved the gum.
7441 2018-05-05 21:42:33 Shoutout to @ericpeaden11 for showing me how to check the oil level and put oil in the car 
7442 2018-05-05 21:42:17 this was just a box of brownie mix w the amount of oil it called for then 1/4 cup of banana purée! right before i put them in the oven i drizzled it w peanut butter & baked them the normal time!
7443 2018-05-05 21:42:03 Why did I think it would be a good idea to fall asleep in the sun with baby oil on scalded isn't even the word

7446 2018-05-05 21:41:45 the oil on that damn pillar made me smell like lube for a week
7447 2018-05-05 21:41:44 I’m normal-slightly acne prone but I used to be an oil stick
7448 2018-05-05 21:41:34 But also learn to be content. ;-)
7449 2018-05-05 21:41:31 I think taking my parrot for a pedicure, getting an oil change (and other services) for my car, grocery shopping, putting my air conditioner in the window, and vacuuming is enough productivity for one day. Laundry can wait.

7450 2018-05-05 21:41:04 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
7451 2018-05-05 21:41:04 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
7452 2018-05-05 21:41:00 Data is the new oil
7453 2018-05-05 21:40:59 Not seen anything serious yet apart from Bam beauty oil.
7454 2018-05-05 21:40:50 Yep, nothing says pointless regs like having to cut quality oil with Glycerin because Ambrose decided to give patients the middle finger yet again post-Smith and the LPC did little more than a copy/paste of MMAR/MMPR with the ACMPR.

7456 2018-05-05 21:40:07 Honor-integrity-limited at dealerships any more. THIRD time to pay for oil change that DIDN'T happen!

7459 2018-05-05 21:39:55 Maybe because France doesn’t have any oul do they are better off going green. Good for them. Oil is a curse.

7465 2018-05-05 21:39:32 I dream if a day when one of you keyboard warriors say “tar sands” in front of a good ol” boy from Ft.Mac who’s broke his back working in the “oil sands”. Then we’d see how much you throw around that derogatory term.
7466 2018-05-05 21:39:00 Wouldn't that LITERALLY be the dream? I'm not even kidding!
7467 2018-05-05 21:38:59 I know there is a necessity for oil. My question, "is this necessity of resource, or income?"
7468 2018-05-05 21:38:50 Keep your hair moisturised (MPL Oil) and DONT comb it #Afro #naturalhair
7469 2018-05-05 21:38:49 The MSM can spin that shite smells like oil of cloves if you add sugar to it, and the public will buy it.
7470 2018-05-05 21:38:43 If you go to Argentina, check out Patagonia
7471 2018-05-05 21:38:39 Or else What? ... 
We attack Iran, with NATO n Israel helping US .
Then Russia will have to help Iran with China then backing them as well as this will disrupt their oil supply and they are already pissed at the US.
And we will then have a nuclear WW3 on our hands n heads.
7472 2018-05-05 21:38:36 So my car has a hole in the exhaust, it need a service and an oil change and the brake pads need changing.... honestly as soon as I passed my test all my money goes on my car
7473 2018-05-05 21:38:13 Say no to petrol, oil, and diesel consumption.
7474 2018-05-05 21:37:58 Errrm Syria has done and Iraq were doing.....until military action stopped them. Also the term petrocurrency refers to currency whose value is tied to the price of oil
7475 2018-05-05 21:37:52 As much as it sucks, since you don't know what is causing it, I think staying home is smart.  Have you ever tried "Miracle oil"?  I have skin allergies and it helps mine, and in fact seems to have my eczema under control on my hands w/out the damage my prescription meds cause!
7476 2018-05-05 21:37:42 @realDonaldTrump Drop everything there a real crisis tonight. Not in some oil rich country but in the U.K. Sir Alex Ferguson that can do a better job than you criminal politicians that get over paid to do fuck all is very ill. Show some support for a great man !
7477 2018-05-05 21:37:21 main reason is just to contest Russia for the oil there tbh
7478 2018-05-05 21:36:51 We all Forced to subsidize oil without the subsidies  would cost $20 a gallon
7479 2018-05-05 21:36:46 Here is some great advice: Don’t get an oil change at Walmart. My car literally doesn’t work anymore...
7480 2018-05-05 21:36:31 Well, yes but I was trying to wake you up to tell you the coffee oil was here! But it’s cold now, so yours is col.. I mean iced coffee oil now!

7497 2018-05-05 21:33:41 Oil prices will go up for all his oil buddies though
7498 2018-05-05 21:33:37 To be oil & water...
7499 2018-05-05 21:33:01 Don’t have anything to eat but smell gross oil coming from the outside. Saw something upsetting, which I try very hard to convince myself it doesn’t matter. Hungry, sad, stressed and feeling defeated. Why we care about ppl’s approval, while they don’t care about us at all?
7500 2018-05-05 21:32:44 “Dr.” oz is little more than a snake oil salesman, so in Trump’s mind, a perfect choice for the job.

I think the shells literally float is a simmering vat of oil, and the ground meat, which is submerged, is scooped into the shells. They should stop serving those "tacos"!

7535 2018-05-05 21:27:38 Imagine for a second how many barrels of oil were used to produce the fuel for the Iraq & Afghanistan US military operations. Now reflect on George W. Bush increasing the strategic reserve not long after getting in. Oh, and also, remember how gas prices went from $1.25 to $3+.
7536 2018-05-05 21:27:22 CO2 is needed for plant growth.

7542 2018-05-05 21:26:07 Entire @GOP is plastic. Everything they say is Fake News and Alternative Facts. That’s why tRump was a great fit. Just another snake oil salesman for their cult.

7547 2018-05-05 21:25:28 I’m too black to be trying to not put on any kind of lotion or oil.  Being ashy is never a good look for the dark skinned ones.
7548 2018-05-05 21:25:15 yes i believe you are correct, The US froze the money back in the 70's when the Iranians kicked out the puppet government the US and Britain had installed. (so they could steal the oil) And yes i believe Obama was the enemy within
7549 2018-05-05 21:25:00 I know it’s tempting to avoid oils and use very harsh ingredients that strip your skin, but oils can be helpful and stripping your skin is definitely harmful! Use a cleanser without SLS (cerave) and a nighttime oil that is high in linoleic acid (jojoba, rosehip, grapeseed)

7554 2018-05-05 21:24:38 Russia has an oil for goods deal with Iran to help them get their oil to market.  They would. They understand the game the Saudis are playing and Iran is more important to their (and China's) long-term plans.  That's why MbS keeps trying to make a deal with Putin and failing.
7555 2018-05-05 21:24:35 I know the state shot some subsidies to an oil company at one point. But I'm not aware of any current subsidies or mandates at the state level.

7567 2018-05-05 21:22:34 Resouce shortages, particularly foodstuffs, oil, and certain metals, were a constant problem for the Nazis, and without the Soviets a Germany cut off from world trade would not have been able to find success.

7602 2018-05-05 21:13:26 Wait, how does oil dry? Oil can wear off from enough squirrels trying to go up or be washed off from rain, but drying would imply the water evaporates out, but its oil...

7667 2018-05-05 21:01:23 Vespa V50... too much oil was filled in and now apparently the kickstarter does not work anymore - is that plausible?
7668 2018-05-05 21:01:05 I mean dipping it in used oil ain’t frying.
7669 2018-05-05 21:01:00 When Trump took office on 1/20/17, a barrel of oil was around $34. At that time Russia said that oil needed to be above $65/barrel in order for it to fund their economy. The price of oil closed yesterday over $69/barrel. Russia is the beneficiary. Draw your own conclusions.

7677 2018-05-05 20:58:55 My parents are great. They replaced my broken watch and got me an oil change.
7678 2018-05-05 20:58:47 I unfortunately bought my first car, a 220d, after the engines became British again. Of course the oil pump for some reason had a corkscrew fitting instead of straight which meant over time it tightened to the point where it cracked the housing. Mechanic was baffled as to why.
7679 2018-05-05 20:58:28 Oil on my face tho ? Wouldn’t it make it oily?
7680 2018-05-05 20:58:09 Ohh they're deep fried? I'll have to make these at my mother's house during the summer. Kuro's mother hates even the idea of oil stains. Thanks though!!

7684 2018-05-05 20:57:41 Any mechanics out there that can perform a mobile oil change on a freightliner?
7685 2018-05-05 20:57:39 From there you let them rest on absorbent paper to take away any excess of oil while cooking more in the oil. From there, they're ready to eat.

7700 2018-05-05 20:55:21 Well it used to be even worse, at %30 just few years ago, combined with low oil prices.

but it's a real mess to clean up, and if it's on flight feathers, then as long the oil is on them you probably won't be able to fly & escape predators.

if it's on your hands it'll be sticky & you'll pick up lots of dirt & not be able to climb efficiently

7726 2018-05-05 20:49:59 to everyone confused why (vegetable) oil on fur / feathers would be bad because "fur/feathers have natural oils" and "they can eat oil":

you, too, can safely eat vegetable oil. your hair also has a natural oil coat.

now please take a handful of olive oil & rub it in ur hair
7727 2018-05-05 20:49:24 I got my car an oil change, a separate tune up, renewed my registration and a wash.  She still looks like shit but she’s running so smoof

7750 2018-05-05 20:46:16 How fast can they retool to smaller cars after the next oil crisis?

Oh right, they'll just build them in China or Korea.
7751 2018-05-05 20:46:15 Wars in the Middle East have been fomented, the goal of 911 which was indeed an insider job, so that they could control all the oil the world relies upon. Control is a deep desire of those who are self-serving, what we call the Service-to-Self.

7806 2018-05-05 20:39:00 I’m surprised that a modern V8 gets not much less mileage than the V6, and the new ones get over 20 mpg on the highway with V8 power.
7807 2018-05-05 20:38:50 Napoleon started to have seizures regularly because of a brain tumor. CBD oil daily with his food really made a huge difference. Once he hit 16 yo though he had to be put on phenobarbital and it helped without any break through seizures.
7808 2018-05-05 20:37:58 @AndrewScheer it is toobadU avoid telling the truth of the AB oil industry to CANADIANS AB from Lougheed  Klein ect & Harper who sat on his hands for some 10yrs on pipelines AB was busy selling&never wanted to share oil benefit with CANADIANS busysellingto the US we import 56%...
7809 2018-05-05 20:37:50 You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions;   (Psalm 45:7, ESV)
7810 2018-05-05 20:37:25 My mom uses Bio oil but it requires patience because it takes time to work.
7811 2018-05-05 20:37:23 Elbows deep in an oil pump on a 300m. UgH...
7812 2018-05-05 20:37:21 Vitamin c oil has anti aging benefits, topical vitamin C is also great for protecting your skin from damage especially from the sun's UVA and UVB rays. That's because vitamin C is an antioxidant, so it naturally helps to strengthen your skin and repel things that could damage it
7813 2018-05-05 20:37:07 But they arent doing that because they want to. They are doing it because some asshole in a comfy chair wants oil. That isnt thier fault.
7814 2018-05-05 20:37:01 This is genius. What kind of oil?
7815 2018-05-05 20:36:30 Rub some olive oil on my tatas.
7816 2018-05-05 20:36:10 The economy has never been this large before. If u look at the stocks of most companies that have been around more then 30 years. In the mid 80s they shoot up and keep going up bc we move off the gold standard and into the oil dollar. It's not that big a deal when minwage is 12.
7817 2018-05-05 20:36:00 Luke and I are off to accomplish a lifelong goal-purchase and use all matching spice and oil jars. 
It’s a big day y’all.
7818 2018-05-05 20:35:42 What's your favorite edc?
7819 2018-05-05 20:35:31 I use cannabis oil on my own skin. It works wonders for many problems. Pain, ulcers, inflammation, etc. Started treated one with ingestible oil for her breathing problems and is looking promising!

7822 2018-05-05 20:35:11 C'mon, what's a bot gotta do to get an oil fix around here?
7823 2018-05-05 20:34:58 Black seed oil?
7824 2018-05-05 20:34:13 you got that didnt you
7825 2018-05-05 20:34:10 Nah you’re alright, not paying towards the snake oil salesman’s new Bentley.
7826 2018-05-05 20:34:09 When will you stupid English realise if it wasn't for Scotlands oil which you English squandered the Scottish whiskey industry Scottish beef Scottish fishing industry's Scotland pays more in than they get out that's why you don't want Scotland to leave
7827 2018-05-05 20:33:53 PSA friends. If you buy a used car please for the love of god check the underside of the oil cap. If it has any build up on it and youre paying more than $500 for the car don't do it.
7828 2018-05-05 20:33:49 Yes. It takes the support of ISIS, a pseudo state with oil money to get them : a school boy or a loony outside a church don't have that
7829 2018-05-05 20:33:36 Good work.  Jared Kushner’s little oil venture in Golan.
7830 2018-05-05 20:33:33 Professional opinion-Glock 21 yay or nay?
7831 2018-05-05 20:33:30 Castor oil too
It does wonders
7832 2018-05-05 20:33:23 Getting my cars oil changed in Cypress and there is a Pitbull and Pomeranian here to keep customers company. 10/10 will definitely be coming back.
7833 2018-05-05 20:33:18 :)
7834 2018-05-05 20:33:17 hehe, those were an experiment! I tried going for an "oil slick" feel.
7835 2018-05-05 20:33:06 Oil changed, ulta, bed bath & beyond, heroes, sheets washed, comforter drying, blankets washing.. Room dusted. But so much more to do 
7836 2018-05-05 20:33:01 Olive oil
7837 2018-05-05 20:32:57 "Look at me, look at me..Im Heid."
I get it.
7838 2018-05-05 20:32:46 Oh man, @IcelandFoods - your No Bull burgers are INCREDIBLE! Thank you so much for this! Please keep creating more delicious cruelty-free vegan food!  What with you cutting out palm oil and plastic packaging, I think I'll end up shopping with you for the rest of my life...
7839 2018-05-05 20:32:45 Olive oil
7840 2018-05-05 20:32:34 Do some meditation and clear your mind get some thc oil vape the  creativity will pour out money 


7841 2018-05-05 20:32:28 Yeah just healing from 1st, and second degree burns suffered from hot cooking oil spilling onto my ankle at work.
7842 2018-05-05 20:32:26 So I saw a YouTube video where people (and the YouTuber) basically bashed @beautybakerie for having to buy an oil to go under the foundation as if they don't buy primers for other foundations ... I cannot wait until my package is here. Thank you @undertaker0024

7846 2018-05-05 20:31:45 M31 "The Andromeda Galaxy" is pure genius on Oil & phosphorescence on Belgian linen @Cathrinmachin Cathrin Machin Contemporary. Are you going to show or sell? I adore this piece of work. You are quite an Artists!!!
7847 2018-05-05 20:31:33 I need a new tire, alignment, oil change, new filters and the tire alone is $233. Is this some kinda karma coming back at me 
7848 2018-05-05 20:31:23 @Babbletr0n Now that Cold Storage is getting phased out as relevant content, do you have any plans to remove demon spirit stones from the oil transmute?
7849 2018-05-05 20:31:09 I'm going to make pumpkin bread to use my last can of pumpkin so I don't have to move it. I'm on my way to buy more flour, sugar, and oil to make the pumpkin bread.
7850 2018-05-05 20:30:58 That's ok with me Heid ..Music is like food..some people like steak and some hate it..it's personal preference..the times I tweet mean something..you ethier get it or don't..sorry to peeps who hate it.
7851 2018-05-05 20:30:54 And honestly, I'm really just paying for the oil because I get full synthetic. I drive about 350+ miles a week or more. I need good oil. Lol.
7852 2018-05-05 20:30:52 I like military people that actually picked up a rifle to defend my great nation, not some seman putting oil into an engine and whacking his junk cause he has not seen a lady in 6 months.
7853 2018-05-05 20:30:51 so to recap:

1. protest online (where you don't get killed as much)
2. rally behind another leader when your leader is silenced
3. attack the oil

last point on oil, its not human
you are not attacking people
you retain moral high ground

good luck
7854 2018-05-05 20:30:46 Combine 4 tsps hummus with 2 quarts Danish pastry. Mix into  Olive Oil. Roast. Serve
7855 2018-05-05 20:30:45 @anthonyatti I designed extraction plant pollution free . extraction oil from coal . cleaner than drilling for oil . Kentucky alone has more oil than IRAN.
7856 2018-05-05 20:30:43 Pro tip: ice pack on your neck and peppermint essential oil on temples (dilates restricted blood vessels).
7857 2018-05-05 20:30:00 "Watch out for that first step - it's a doozy!"
7858 2018-05-05 20:29:59 In the waiting room while getting my car's oil changed. Anyone wanna place bets on how long before one of the mechanics comes in to mansplain engines to me?
7859 2018-05-05 20:29:33 Missed this till today. I've yet to see an Andrew Nikiforuk article I don't agree with. #KinderMorgan battle brings Trumplandia to Canada  "Oil, a commodity that invites aggression like an angry drunk in a roadside bar, knows no limits or borders" #StopKM #ProtecttheInlet
7860 2018-05-05 20:29:29 It is RUSSIA that wants and needs the ME oil, not the USA.
7861 2018-05-05 20:29:26 I hate the price of the express oil change, but it's soooo convenient.
7862 2018-05-05 20:29:14 As a baby I had seriously bad eczema, when my mum bathed me she put padre pio oil in the water. Now there's not a drop of eczema on me!
7863 2018-05-05 20:29:13 if Buhari loses half of the oil he can produce for UK, EU, U.S.
why would we back him?
ONLY reason we back him is he delivers cheap oil :|
what other reason COULD there be?
if he fails to produce, we replace him
7864 2018-05-05 20:29:06 Totaled? It didn't look like it even got a scratch
7865 2018-05-05 20:29:05 girl i really dont know!! im so surprised fr. the only new things i started using is cantu’s twist cream and wild hair growth oil so maybe thats what it is
7866 2018-05-05 20:28:51 Do we all remember the referendum to overturn this ridiculous tax giveaway to the oil companies?  Yeah, it failed. Stupidity gets stupid results.
7867 2018-05-05 20:28:36 To heal a pimple quickly, apply tea tree oil on pimple every few hours, and apply vitamin E oil on the spot, about 1 hour before bedtime.
7868 2018-05-05 20:28:36 Electric cars don't need oil changes.
7869 2018-05-05 20:28:28 At first she tried smoking it, and after the first hit, within a couple of minutes she would calm down, and it was noticeable. Being high was always practical in her everyday life, so a switch to CBD oil was made, and was just as affective. It helps the symptoms no doubt.
7870 2018-05-05 20:28:16 This is great. What kind of oil did she use?
7871 2018-05-05 20:28:13 I didnt realise you was' Raychel.'
Are you the blonde lady at the back?
7872 2018-05-05 20:28:09 I feel like I know what happens at the end now, even though I haven’t seen any direct spoilers.

7874 2018-05-05 20:27:44 @DrOz is a snake oil purveyor.
7875 2018-05-05 20:27:27 #norwegian #haters 74.94 Brent Oil. Verden utanfor Oslo og Akershus trenger olje og gass i mange år til. Kva med å stenge olje og gass kranene, samt penge strømmen for nettopp Oslo og Akershus. .
7876 2018-05-05 20:27:06 Things I learned from my family on Skype today: I might need to whore out my ankles to buy some lavender oil and never, ever punch a deer in the face.
7877 2018-05-05 20:26:56 more advice, protest by attacking the oil

1. you can, its in southeast, i can provide you maps
2. people rarely die hitting the oil, while it does produce gains:

it limits gov income, their ability to crackdown
limits his influence with other nations...
7878 2018-05-05 20:26:53 I hate going to get my oil changed because they find everything wrong. Today I just stopped the man before he could even start talking.
7879 2018-05-05 20:26:31 Very simple. Go to Walmart and for 30 bucks, buy plug in oil filled radiators for your public housing apartment. They work well and stay warm for a good while after they shut off. Heat justice = you pay for what heat you use, not society
7880 2018-05-05 20:26:23 PETA members have killed more people than NRA members.
7881 2018-05-05 20:26:08 Whatever happen to those days when hot oil and a rubber mat would do?
7882 2018-05-05 20:25:46 Because there is no oil there.
7883 2018-05-05 20:25:09 And that they largely trafficked in snake oil
7884 2018-05-05 20:24:51 Bribery exists at every level of government.
But it isn’t as bad as it seems.
Political bosses provide the expertise & efficiency that businessmen need but voters are in capable of.
They are too busy hoopin’ & hollerin’ & rollin’ on the floor in church.

7887 2018-05-05 20:24:47 Your government spends more than it collects, what will you do about Faslane and defence force, oil running out, border control, have to apply to join EU and  fishing will be out of your control. Think it through.
7888 2018-05-05 20:24:47 We don’t BTS to be overworked and tired but at the same time everyone wants them to add more US dates. 

PS: if y’all do come to Lucas oil stadium in Indianapolis I will be happy forever @BigHitEnt @BTS_twt
7889 2018-05-05 20:24:46 It’s a trap
7890 2018-05-05 20:24:42 If it’s an oil stain, pour some baby powder on it, then soak in bleach for a few minutes and wash!
7891 2018-05-05 20:24:11 They also need to focus on big Pharma paid candidates conforming to the rules on vested interests. Most big Pharma companies stripping out tiny pieces of cannabis oil and patenting as a treatment for something the whole thing does fine for 1000th of what they hope to charge.
7892 2018-05-05 20:23:55 Me too. Yes, was a brutal winter here. Windy as hell too. Worst year here for oil yet, plus I used quartz electric heaters to knock chill off. Electric about $130 mos. for nothing. I am frugal. Take each day as it comes, have no choice. Worried, very worried.
7893 2018-05-05 20:23:42 Ok, Im gonna be honest, that's turn it down music for me. I like, well you know, either James Blunt or Adele type music.

7903 2018-05-05 20:22:26 @christinaroto I did the oil thing too and got a good laugh. Tell mom to put cayenne pepper in the bird food. Squirrels don't like it and birds don't mind.
7904 2018-05-05 20:22:22 CBD oil would probably be more efficacious and less illegal in Ohio
7905 2018-05-05 20:22:21 Wen David attain the level of getting best international act nomination talkless of winning u can den call him crude oil
7906 2018-05-05 20:22:13 But THANK GOD for legalization and CBD oil remedies for cramps 
7907 2018-05-05 20:21:29 Cannabis oil kills cancer.  Magnesium kills cancer.  Tumeric kills cancer.
7908 2018-05-05 20:21:20 @WhartonEntrep extracting oil from coal is 41% more oil in usa . Kentucky alone has more oil than iran  . one plant built will bring in 7.2 billion dollars in first year because no air or water pollution created by this process  I know I designed it.
7909 2018-05-05 20:21:10 Wanna make yer hair stand on end?  When I was a kid wayyyyy back when, Mum would oil us up (usually olive oil) for a day at the beach. :-) Probably not the best for a blonde Scottish child.
7910 2018-05-05 20:21:03 Picking up car post oil change:

7918 2018-05-05 20:18:16 Very good questions. What kind of oil did she use if its machine oil it will kill or sicken the squirrel.
7919 2018-05-05 20:18:15 V6 has less torque and gets the same mileage. V8 sounds prettier. Transmission is the key buying criterion, imo.
7920 2018-05-05 20:18:08 Snake oil salesman like him need to go away.
7921 2018-05-05 20:17:37 Finally getting my oil changed....
7922 2018-05-05 20:17:29 Saw one of those maps once that have funny descriptions for different parts of California. Kern County was labeled as Texas. Certainly looks like West Texas, Joshua trees excepted, and we've even got the oil wells and wind turbines.
7923 2018-05-05 20:17:27 He's on a roll today. He called them "gross" earlier. Like a 13 year old.
7924 2018-05-05 20:17:24 Big Oil will need to scratch that one from their excuse book on why Canada needs to embrace the Trans Mountain pipeline and all this selling oil to Asia by oil tanker nonsense! #bcpoli #ableg #cdnpoli

7930 2018-05-05 20:16:07 Impractical? I put 6,000km on it for my work commute from Belgium to the Netherlands over the course of a year. Accusump pissed some oil, but otherwise all cool...:)
7931 2018-05-05 20:15:52 I‘ve been there use vitamin c oil I know random af but it really helped the skin to heal faster.
7932 2018-05-05 20:15:52 I did.....tell you what! I will watch the film and come back to you.
Do you like it that I change my picture regularly or is it stupid? Come on be honest...
7933 2018-05-05 20:15:06 My Dad was farmed out in Quebec at 9 yrs old. His Dad died, his Mom was poor. If he was sick & didn’t work, no coal oil, no supper. He learned to work sick. He worked almost everyday till he died at 51, from Yukon railway to Fort Mac, to Detour Lake flyin Gold mine, to trucking.
7934 2018-05-05 20:15:00 tonight we’re gonna use so much oil we’re gonna have to be in the shower to do this show. I’m talking full body drenched, oiled up butt plug, and extra bright lights for maximum shine   
7935 2018-05-05 20:14:54 Glad to remind you. I use a  lime oil from @NaturesUltra They have been the best source I’ve found. Since i use their oil they are letting me hook up those that are interested in buying. Use ALRYJAZZ15 for 15% off plus fast-n-free shipping.

and by the oil that they bleed the crew and crows fly the skulls and bones

7947 2018-05-05 20:13:32 God bless you. I don't know who used old engine oil to rub his hair.
7948 2018-05-05 20:13:26 Lots of plans, just taking it slow. Today it needs a new coolant resovoir (current is a water bottle, lmao) and new oil.
7949 2018-05-05 20:13:21 Looks good, though I prefer to crack open a tin of Tiny Tots 2-layer sardines in olive oil and then douse them with @FranksRedHot
7950 2018-05-05 20:13:14 You MCM has used hot oil to damage his fingers while frying plantain 
7951 2018-05-05 20:13:06 Be on the lookout for a stupendous, clairvoyant violet-eyed ESFJ oil heiress, slowly removing a vivid violet rough linen chemise, soothes away the debilitating fear in the mind of a roan Appaloosa.
7952 2018-05-05 20:13:00 I have never seen the film. It looks like your peaking out of a shower curtain.
7953 2018-05-05 20:12:44 One should always be skeptical of the righteous religious man... he usually is a snake oil salesman, a con artist and charlatan.

7956 2018-05-05 20:12:11 my eyebrows are growing thank you jesus sunbaenim and castor oil
7957 2018-05-05 20:12:05 I think they closed it off... too many Jeepers ruining the kind and trails, littering and spilling oil and generally being dicks.
7958 2018-05-05 20:12:04 Lol
7959 2018-05-05 20:11:49 Don’t let the days go by, man.
7960 2018-05-05 20:11:40 I was thinking about that today..but it gets peeps attention .. you know the scene right where jack says. Here's Johniee lol
7961 2018-05-05 20:11:20 Change it to Ray Whinstone
7962 2018-05-05 20:11:18 Makes resale value good though. Also I find myself looking after a car a lot more if I love it. E.g checking oil weekly, listening to the engine for slightest changes in performance. 
Compared to an old fiesta where so long as wasn’t on fire... I’m sure it’s fine

7964 2018-05-05 20:11:08 How do you differentiate communism and socialism and why do you find the distinction to be of substance here?

...the oil isn't being *ignored* by the socialists in Venezuela, it's being horrendously mismanaged, the state oil company is a shit.
7965 2018-05-05 20:10:58 He used old engine oil to rub the sides of his head.
7966 2018-05-05 20:10:51 Remember that says the fuck. I'm allergic to a minute or oil (baby, olive, coconut, etc) on some video games in Dragon's
7967 2018-05-05 20:10:39 By "doomed" I mean that they have an structural deficit. It means that down the line they'll have to reform to not go bankrupt. They are also kind of an exception because they don't need an army, sit on top of oil and have low population. Not an extrapolable system.
7968 2018-05-05 20:10:33 Trouble is you have to reapply oil every day as it dries then squirrel can get up again 
7969 2018-05-05 20:10:27 Dear mutineers if you don't like me, pretend that you are A donut and roll into the oil reservoir and die

Purple Power Coconut Oil w C60:
99.026% Coconut Oil
0.0974% of C60 Powder
$370.00 for 16 oz
COST PER OUNCE:

Ripoff. $50 would be fair for 16 oz @ >100% profit.
7974 2018-05-05 20:10:05  "Got nothing," you say? 
I've to watch a reality tv star, conman, and grifter cleverly rob the poor and middle class blind, while banking billions. Also, he conspired with Russia to steal our election bc of oil. 
He's an international disgrace every f--king day!
7975 2018-05-05 20:10:04 My friend works at carmax so he usually does my oil changes cheaper for me but he wasn’t home and i needed one so i went to Mr. tire. After they told me what i needed done i immediately regretting it and i hate myself for being so easily persuaded

7979 2018-05-05 20:09:44 Yep... i've tried this. They keep it up until they wear the oil off, then they get to the feeder anyway.

7983 2018-05-05 20:09:12 Long ago I worked as an oil geologist. Saw enormous mounds of crystalline salt rise from the depths as we drilled through the Charles Salt formation in the Williston Basin, evaporated from ancient seas 350 million years ago. I did in fact taste it, but only after careful washing!
7984 2018-05-05 20:09:07 My oil change was about 65, apparently i needed new brakes even tho i said they felt fine but they assured me i needed them& that was super expsenive even tho i only said to replace my brake pads and they charged me $40 for an air filter plus all the labor costs. I was pissed
7985 2018-05-05 20:09:01 .. unfounded emotional turmoil that may just be the castor oil gettin in his eyes. We may never know. Nor may we wish to.

7990 2018-05-05 20:08:06 With my fat hands, tomorrows heat, and tanning oil, I could cook up eggs anywhere and anytime 
7991 2018-05-05 20:08:05 Took my car to jiffy lube to get the oil changed, so I straightened up the front seat so I wouldn’t look like a slob. WELL they were kind enough to vacuum out my car!!! I’m so embarrassed, my back seat contains a chair, a bag of bread, and many other things
7992 2018-05-05 20:08:01 Ahhh you are a softie after all x
7993 2018-05-05 20:08:00 I’m 53, no secondary insurance. My oil heat here cost $500 a month x 5 this winter, didn’t need until November and I kept house at 68.  My co-pays went up, my drug plan went up monthly. My SS went up, but Medicare went up same amount. Worried about future. Confused mostly.
7994 2018-05-05 20:07:57 Depends on the truffle, really. If it doesn't have much flavor, it's either old or lower-grade. Truffle oil is objectively a travesty, though. Better to just use plain olive oil instead.
7995 2018-05-05 20:07:56 I can’t even change my own oil lmao can you picture me trying hahahahahhaa
7996 2018-05-05 20:07:53 It's all right for you..I got to face the Swampies soon at HH soon..Can't wait ;)

7999 2018-05-05 20:07:25 Why are they buying snake oil? There is no chance that glass of clean air could help in any way. Buy more insolation for your house, use solar heating, share&carpool vehicle, Live in a smaller place like a studio apartment. Do not contribute problem by using energy unnecessarily.

Many years ago, I've changed the oil in my car, changed out headlights, etc. There is a lot I will hire someone to do, but I can do it if it is needed. I can install a new light fixture or install and run a new electrical outlet.
8003 2018-05-05 20:07:02 Got my oil changed, now taking bf to get his rental car, and of course he wants to eat lunch as well.

8017 2018-05-05 20:04:32 Coming to get an oil change right before they get super busy, success 
8018 2018-05-05 20:04:23 I think squirrels will work out how to get up the pole eventually even with oil! Your squirrels will for sure anyway!!! #SneakySciuridae 
8019 2018-05-05 20:04:08 I just saw a comment, "....there must be a lot of oil under Hawaii to be causing all of this..." GTFO.
8020 2018-05-05 20:03:50 This makes me sad. Oil is not good for wildlife, if squirrels get it in their fur they can’t wash it out- it leads to matting, and in the winter if they can’t fluff up their fur they can freeze to death.

8027 2018-05-05 20:03:10 If people like this are so worried about Canadian oil then they should tie themselves to the railway tracks because that’s where oil will be transported if we allow these idiots to shut down pipelines.
8028 2018-05-05 20:03:04 I looked them up in separate sources before I mentioned it, I’m not going to say something if I know it can be easily debunked. Oil system is pretty much in with the engine cost already and the only expensive thing you mentioned was the gearbox. An EV motor costs on average $3k.

8037 2018-05-05 20:01:20 Not pro-uk destruction at all. The fact that England will crumble without us is a semi-unfortunate side effect of losing OUR oil, whiskey, green energy and shipyards. We are being dragged out of the EU, May is a criminal, England have a permanent Tory government. Good luck, srsly
8038 2018-05-05 20:01:18 Is it ecological (we all know the race is doomed, climate change peak oil etc) or is it economic (we all know the rich get richer, we're being played etc) or is it demographic (the Age of the West is past, we are helplessly going under) or what? How do you read it?

8046 2018-05-05 20:00:48 Why is it only ONE industry which counts? There are many thriving industrial sectors in Canada, but Scheer wants to go back to something that is gone.

8066 2018-05-05 19:57:36 Ok, good tip , did you get the coconut oil from the squirril video? Made me laugh out loud!! There needs to be more of that in life 
8067 2018-05-05 19:57:34 That explains why trump is drilling for oil everywhere but his own rectum.  There is oil in the polar caps.  They will be setting up refineries no doubt ergo nuclear power plants.  Processing costs will go way down overall.  We are screwed pure & simple

8070 2018-05-05 19:56:50 Don’t know if these figures are right, but the total costs of EVs to make are close to parity , don’t forget it’s not just cost of engine, it’s oil system, radiator, fan belt, exhaust system, ignition, gears , clutch .....

8072 2018-05-05 19:56:25 So how did you get to Guelph if you don’t want oil products and they don’t make electric planes I guess it’s fairy farts for you. Time for you to go
8073 2018-05-05 19:55:54 Like a booming economy?  Like the record employment & becoming the World's #1 Oil Producing nation?

You're $@#% insane.

It feels so good to make a tall, muscular, good looking Alpha serve me. 

Something my other bitch ass subs will never experience in their worthless lives.
8081 2018-05-05 19:54:09 Two slices of pizza are the equivalent to swallowing 3 spoons of warm oil. Do you feel like eating pizza now?
8082 2018-05-05 19:53:54 Need a little oil rubbed in there?
8083 2018-05-05 19:53:22 Well we can make better choices like not returning billions of dollars a year in oil revenue to the Canadian economy so we can make better choices but our choices are handicapped by Alberta having to support others who continually make bad choices

1) High bond yield (possible FED Hike soon-FIIs outflow will continue)
2) High Crude oil Prices
3) Depreciating Rupee vs Dollar

8095 2018-05-05 19:50:38 I'm so disturbed by Toni & Baby being a thing. I go to bed with the company of an oil diffuser and multiple pillows tho, so I guess I should worry about myself.
8096 2018-05-05 19:50:21 Given this event has actually happened, the continued Barnet formula vs the distance of the Scottish economy according to Ek's plan for oil revenues at $130 a barrel...
Demonstrably.
8097 2018-05-05 19:49:52 Oil seems better to me... The slinky feels like it could easily cut them, or even worse if they get a little toe caught in there 
8098 2018-05-05 19:49:51 They can be. I get extra sensitive to lights so I had take some tylenol, CBD oil, and put on my shades to get through the A-roll.
8099 2018-05-05 19:49:51 He said, about the Iraq war, we should take the oil. Pillaging is not only outlawed by the Geneva Convention, but also, the Uniform Code of Military Justice. As is torture. Which he is in favor of, and has advocated for.
8100 2018-05-05 19:49:29 I wanna get an oil diffuser
8101 2018-05-05 19:49:27 Squalane oil is my shit
8102 2018-05-05 19:49:27 Well then in that case England can pay back all the oil money and whiskey excise to Scotland

8108 2018-05-05 19:48:46 Seems like snake oil to me. No noticeable reduction in kicks but massively noticeable increase in miscues.
8109 2018-05-05 19:48:44 Norway is a COUNTRY that OWNS the oil company. Alberta is a PROVINCE that licences production rights to publicly owned companies in return4royalties+land bonus payments etc. As a province, we pay equalization to have nots. So...cupboard is bare, spending was silly, now NDP debt.
8110 2018-05-05 19:48:38 Yes. He needs to pour anointing oil and pray for you.
8111 2018-05-05 19:48:38 Gloriously remembered I have Italian herb-infused olive oil.

8117 2018-05-05 19:47:57 Why am I at Uncle Ed’s on telegraph getting a oil change and they all just took a shot of henny with me  I’m screaming. Happy cinco de mayo I guess
8118 2018-05-05 19:47:46 It's simple. The got the massive oil and gas deals done, but anything else has to go through better government sources with power. T just isn't worth the money any more.
8119 2018-05-05 19:47:45 Public officials are greedy.
The poor devils are forced to live on a begger’s salary.
On purpose, they will delay approval of your business permit applications in expectation of a bribe to grease the bureaucratic machine.

Please don’t do this. This is my nightmare.
8126 2018-05-05 19:46:46 they don't have oil, but that does not me our corporate interests are benign.

it's been a half century of "training" the ROK to defend itself.

they should be able by now, and likely would be if our efforts were to that end and not some other.
8127 2018-05-05 19:46:41 I had heard rumours that oil and gas workers are also impacted by this. Do you have any idea how many of your colleagues are impacted? Are HMRC making any efforts to hold the company liable rather than you individually?
8128 2018-05-05 19:46:18 I love bottom with oil on they ass
8129 2018-05-05 19:46:00 @DavidFWolf - no real secret...
Tomato
Onion
Cilantro
Serrano pepper (not jalapeños)
Lime juice
Avocado
Salt to taste

And...

A bit of extra virgin olive oil.

And always leave the pits inside. This prevents the guac from turning brown. 
8130 2018-05-05 19:45:45 I wish you could tell me how to make it stop. Also: pink sea salt, olive oil from the "right" countries, organic French butter, and about 15 other things my SO *has* to have which are doubling our grocery bill

Trump won reelection in 2020 despite losing the popular vote by 20 million.  By 2024 unemployment was 20% and  gas was $20 a gallon.  Trump said he would bomb the oil companies and talk to Iran.  Later he said he meant the other way around.  Ann Coulter blamed Mexicans

8140 2018-05-05 19:44:17 You’re talking as though EV’s don’t develop faults. EV’s still have a drive train, which are prone to failing completely rather than needing an easy repair. Batteries lose capacity after several years. Would they rather be replacing fan belts and oil every so often,

8147 2018-05-05 19:43:29 They were hunted for their oil. The discovery of fossil oil saved them from extinction. If we ban fossil fuels we will have to go back to killing whales or whats left of them.
8148 2018-05-05 19:43:16 I hear there is some lovely wasteland in Alaska sitting on more oil than we even know what to do with.

8151 2018-05-05 19:43:00 Buffett’s purchase of American Express, which he purchased post Salad Oil Crisis, is a must-read case study for students of investing.
8152 2018-05-05 19:42:56 It should mean starting to sell down the Strategic Oil Reserve. Even threatening this will keep oil prices down.

8159 2018-05-05 19:41:49 The cashier at O’Riley’s asked if I was sure I had the right oil filter. I was briefly miffed (because of course he asked because I’m a LADY) but I let him check. Turns out I DID have the wrong one… You win this time, PATRIARCHY

8162 2018-05-05 19:41:37 This is like me citing a Percy Jackson book as proof of god. Your bible is a joke, and Scotland, if it gains it's independence, can watch England crumble without our oil and renewable energy, which they steal 2/3 of
8163 2018-05-05 19:41:37 It happened i was there! I know because I was told by oil workers
8164 2018-05-05 19:41:35 I'm almost 60 and just figured women out. 
My wife wanted me to change the oil in her car. I go buy the stuff, come home and say, " you change it, it's not that hard". She says that she doesn't know how, so I change it. 
Proof that women are smarter than men.
8165 2018-05-05 19:41:30 Your an idiot! A wall will do nothing! They should have kicked out your Olive Oil line of European Ancestors
8166 2018-05-05 19:41:15 It warms my heart to know a multinational oil company is profiting greatly in Alaska while allowing American taxpayers to pick up the bill for the climate changing environmental destruction it is causing.

Where’s the oil coming from for 2M+ cars? Or the airplanes? Shirts $200 now as opposed to $50? TVs $4000 and not $400?

8192 2018-05-05 19:38:54 I know i hate taking my car for an oil change, i swear they break things just to make me pay to “fix” it

8202 2018-05-05 19:37:44 Really? Because I watched as over 3 thousand oil workers were laid off so their jobs could be given to TWF from the Philippines
8203 2018-05-05 19:37:36 This weed oil stuff is out of this world.
8204 2018-05-05 19:37:30  Qatar also about the Russian oil company Rosneft with United Arab Emirates  $2 million was laundered from that deal violating US sanctions against  Russia
8205 2018-05-05 19:37:28 Absolutely! Shelby, Reuben and Esther are all on an oil that we add to their meals. We’re working with a human doctor on it, veterinarians are quite on board yet. We’re trying though, they’ll get there soon I’m sure.

8212 2018-05-05 19:34:50 And if it gets too brassy/yellow, use a purple toning shampoo like Clairol. Might also want to look into a keratin oil to apply to damaged bits until it grows out and not over brush your hair. Sorry this happened. :ccc

President Obama repeatedly said we needed to get used to the new lows we had reached because it wasn't going to get better. 

We're now set to become the world's top oil exporter, employment has increased, and the overall vibe is good. 

Remember, it's about control.

8241 2018-05-05 19:30:09 Question, President Trump: What good is being the world's chief oil exporter if our gas prices are still $4/gal?? WE SHOULD NOT BE EXPORTING ANY OIL UNTIL OUR GAS PRICES ARE NORMALIZED AT $1.50 or so per gallon. It's called COMMON SENSE. C'mon, man!

8250 2018-05-05 19:28:22 Pulling the emotion card to lie about a thinker and push your weird narratives about something that clearly was more about oil prices and Latin American corruption is low.
8251 2018-05-05 19:28:16 Gas prices went up in previous years due to gready oil and gas companies setting prices and there being a lack of anti gouging law in Canada. Now gas prices rose due to multiple levels of taxation.

8263 2018-05-05 19:26:13 SO true. It amazes me that ppl still hate this guy. My guess is that they are so blinded by the #Left that they cannot see victory. Lowest unemployment rate, highest oil exports, lower taxes, legislators retiring, military funded, wall being built, America secured, etc.

8267 2018-05-05 19:25:13 Con-man, snake oil salesman!
8268 2018-05-05 19:25:13 Olive oil is fine. It mostly consists of mono-unsaturated fats that are good for us. One has to stay away from poly-unsaturated (omega-6) fatty acids found in vegetable oils like corn, soybean, sunflower, and safflower oils. Soybean & corn oil are the WORST!
8269 2018-05-05 19:25:06 Very easy to go in for a basic oil change and almost leave spending hundreds of dollars on things for my car I don’t even understand.
8270 2018-05-05 19:25:01 How do you feel about coconut oil? Watch and decide for yourself. BTW, the comments are really something (I love reading comments.) The Indian juggernaut is real. The Indian girls (and others) have a lot to say.
8271 2018-05-05 19:24:59 Asked @Jakelikessteak if he wanted to go to the pool and he said "dude all I wanted to do today was throw on some tanning oil and lay out"
8272 2018-05-05 19:24:53 Cool @Pocket feature: under the title of each article in your list is the estimated read time. Helpful when you didn’t realize you’d marked a handful of 4 min reads and you can knock them out while getting an oil change.

8275 2018-05-05 19:24:41 The question about the Rosneft Russian oil deal Is who got the laundered $2 million they’ve trace the rest of the money back to Qatar are in United  Arab Emirates
8276 2018-05-05 19:24:23 I read you’re not supposed to do this, especially in winter. The oil, or in the article I read, Vaseline effects the fur it contacts and alters their ability to stay warm.

8282 2018-05-05 19:22:58 @WholeFoods @WholeFoodsNews 

There is no sustainable palm oil, per experts in animal welfare and sustainability. You carry a LOT of products with palm oil. It's also a "bad" fat. Right?
8283 2018-05-05 19:22:53 Comparing Norway's offshore gushers to Canada's oil/bitumen sands process is apples to oranges. The upstream emission differences are massive. And is saying Norway has $1.2 trillion thanks to socialism supposed to be an argument for capitalism?

8285 2018-05-05 19:22:39 Hutiya, we exploit approximately 25% of gdp on defence each year on both sides instead that money could be used for many important things. The border area has high quality of oil reserves which are unused because of tension. And loc was American conspiracy to stop Russian Allies.

8288 2018-05-05 19:21:57 The question is who was the party who got $2 million that was laundered in the sale of Russian oil co Rosneft violating US sanctions against Russia  Qatar and United Arab Emirates 
8289 2018-05-05 19:21:55 Well - I hear and read it frequently - "no more plastics," "get rid of oil companies," and I am pretty sure they don't know the consequences of what they say. Here in Canada, "ban single use plastics" is all the rage, and a stupid idea. People tend to emote more than think.

8315 2018-05-05 19:18:44 Yes.  And we have 24 hour news channels, and you can watch Chris Hayes, Rachel Maddow, and Lawrence O'Donnell and see the same ground covered over and over.  I miss when e.g., Rachel went to New Orleans to bring a close focus on the oil spill.  More of that, please.

8322 2018-05-05 19:17:19 So everyone is suffering like you? Wallowing in illegally acquired money when the country was earning plenty from oil is not enjoyment.
8323 2018-05-05 19:17:17 So the goal is to band all organizations that lobby and fund politicians? NRA is no different than dug, oil, car, and all other association that lobby and fund politicians. Is your movement to close all gun manufacturers? Who would make guns for the military?

8325 2018-05-05 19:17:14 Good work again Edward. 

But what is stopping the large energy companies spinning off new companies to focus on renewable energies? 

For example ‘Shell’ could split into: ‘Shell Oil & Gas’ and ‘Shell Renewables’. 

Then investors have a clear choice

That aside, the oil would not be good on the birds' feathers either.

8369 2018-05-05 19:09:56 The word says "faith works by love". Meaning as in an automobile faith is like gasoline, while love is like engine oil. When you run out of faith. you stop and can't go anywhere or get anything. When you run out of love the engine breaks down or knocks. Love is the greatest!
8370 2018-05-05 19:09:44 It's all about timing. For the shape you can cheat. Put some saran wrap into a mug, spray in some oil/butter and crack the egg in. Close the saran getting as much air out as possible and clip it closed. Then pop that in your boiling water.

8372 2018-05-05 19:09:34 so about 3 pumps of conditioner, a spoonful of coconut oil, 4 drops of tea tree oil, and then fill up the rest w water but leave room to shake it up! And obviously you can change the measurements to your liking :) but the combination of it all is great, spray it and re-scrunch!
8373 2018-05-05 19:09:10 Less oil on the market, thus higher petrol prices. I don't care, because I don't own a car. The things I need to do, like bringing my son to school and running errands, everything is done by bicycle.
8374 2018-05-05 19:09:09 When broken down into groups, putting the UK & Sweden into the same chart will be like talking about drinking water or oil. Culture players a large part for the UK & the Swedish don’t have that diversity.

8378 2018-05-05 19:08:43 Christopher Hitchens- if you’re reading “God is Not Great” while waiting for your oil to be changed Nobody will bother you. Or make eye contact lol
8379 2018-05-05 19:08:41 It’s was Iranian oil as Iran took control and it was Churchill who pushed and pushed for the English to make it British which we did. So due to a great English man BP has given many Scottish people employment. Remember that when  you bang your drum over Scottish oil.

8416 2018-05-05 19:03:20 Yeah oil dependency on the middle east,and South America makes total sense,
8417 2018-05-05 19:03:10 They think oil money will last forever. They don’t have the population or enough land to compete in the long run with other countries around them.But it’s later like you said they will pay
8418 2018-05-05 19:03:00 About to go spend an arm and a leg on my oil change

8422 2018-05-05 19:02:41 May I ask how you got coconut oil on your glasses
8423 2018-05-05 19:02:25 Uh, I do. And get a nice rebate for it too. Not to mention that giving tax breaks for solar equal to those for oil and gas would make it even more afgoy

8425 2018-05-05 19:02:12 Footnote in a recipe I was reading (which seems about right to me):

"Substitute vegetable or olive oil for bacon drippings if necessary then ask the Lord for forgiveness for throwing away your bacon grease."
8426 2018-05-05 19:01:59 if Puerto Rico had vast resources of Oil,Washington would be thinking differently,the world is closely watching the sanity of Washington Establishment, what a shame
8427 2018-05-05 19:01:27 Exactly! The whole point of dry shampoo is really to absorb oils, & white girls’ hair can get very oily that’s why they wash every other day. But ya black girls’ hair needs as much oil as it can get! This really not for us.

8434 2018-05-05 19:00:52 Actually the vast majority of our oil is from Canada. Last time I seen the figures, it was 85% Canadian oil, then Peru, and like 5% from the shithole middle east.

8459 2018-05-05 18:57:29 Something bit harmful to animals, aka olive oil or rapeseed oil, will be just fine. Obviously engine oil or oil for lubricant is not a good idea in case they wash it off their paws.
8460 2018-05-05 18:57:03 Coconut oil and work that out NOW
8461 2018-05-05 18:56:56 I put coconut oil and salt water in my hair in hopes it will curl. It’s getting too long in the front to be straight. And too lazy to get a haircut!!

So for today's #washday, I decided to incorporate it in my haircare routine by using #AloeVera juice instead of water before applying oil to #prepoo. I'm expecting length and strength.
8479 2018-05-05 18:54:21 Because 1utilities hve sunk costs in plants that use oil, coal , gas. Without   tax incentives, phase outs, and direct government investment no private utility will make the upgrades

Rituals before I stream.  (1) Make certain I have no distractions & prepare my surroundings for same.  (2) Quiet on the set sign is placed outside office. (3) Have good tepid water (cold water will make one cough). (4) I also have an essential oil blend nearby.

8494 2018-05-05 18:52:33 That video misunderstands fossil fuel reserves. Reserves are calculated based on cost of recovery at current prices. If prices rise or technology reduces costs reserves increase. Further, oil can be manufactured from coal, natural gas, or even algae. We'll never run out.
8495 2018-05-05 18:52:13 Oh yes, should have noticed there wasn't a pic of the olives! The peas were fabulous: what a burst of spring and early summer freshness.

8503 2018-05-05 18:51:00 The oil pan price seems a little high. I stopped going to Firestone because they tended to overcharge.

8505 2018-05-05 18:50:57 They say you are what you eat.
If you eat lots fatty foods, you'll get fat.
If you eat oils then you'll get a lot of oil filled pimples

I am human

8507 2018-05-05 18:50:30 How much of this is tied to the oil pipeline?
8508 2018-05-05 18:50:20 Mr. Painter handled him very nicely. 

The President said, "as you all know" when he usually says, "who knew" shrugs, or "no body knows this, but Iraq has a lot of oil". 

As you Allllll know, stay tuned!

8509 2018-05-05 18:49:56 and yet oil hit a new high
8510 2018-05-05 18:49:55 It’s pretty labor intensive. I don’t think it’s unfair of a price. I’d try to wait on the battery if it isn’t dying. Save $144. Did they take the oil pan off to fish out the metal? Or did they break the wingnut off when changing. That’s wild jiffy lube would do that. They suck.
8511 2018-05-05 18:49:17 It’s a 2010 Corolla, it doesn’t even need oil. Also if Jiffy Lube did the work then they’re liable for the repairs

8513 2018-05-05 18:49:06 The only life wire that has the name Nigeria existing is "crude oil" without which the sokoto caliphate will not hesitate to pull off every chain Britain has tied around it (Nigeria) legs and arms. 

Unfortunately we shouldn't  be discussing this, let's talk 2019.

8521 2018-05-05 18:48:13 In 1987,Gorbachev had to say that to survive. By 1991, hardliners attempting pathetic coup were spent force. But failed post-coldwar policy towards Russia (Clinton & cronies treating like Haiti) resurrected Hardliners. Greenspan bubble put oil money in Hardliner pockets.
8522 2018-05-05 18:48:10 and another thing, if i decide to smell like  motor oil then that’s my choice. get over it
8523 2018-05-05 18:48:00 Maybe the rest of the country would be better off if @realDonaldTrump went off all his BP/cholesterol meds and switched to green coffee beans or whatever snake oil @DrOz is peddling this week
8524 2018-05-05 18:48:00 We went to go get an oil change and the dude was like “man it smells bomb in here”

8529 2018-05-05 18:46:50 what’s wrong with the oil pan? battery price is a little high ($160-core)
8530 2018-05-05 18:46:32 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
8531 2018-05-05 18:46:26 It's the little habits that contribute 2 the whole success. Start w. habits like a daily walk or only using oil &amp; vinegar 4 salad dressing.
8532 2018-05-05 18:46:24 BJP never gave us any relief in petrol ... With such a low price of oil in international market! Jaag jao moorkh Bhakton!
8533 2018-05-05 18:46:14 This is hilarious!! They are so determined! How smart of your mother!  I now spray Cedar Oil, the smell of which repels them

8536 2018-05-05 18:45:52 To speed up hair growth, add a few drops of rosemary oil to your shampoo
8537 2018-05-05 18:45:47 I like to think that most people mean well, so I assume it was olive or canola oil. The chance of it being mineral oil is pretty high - we still use it for cosmetics, and we have/can use it as a laxative. It's not harmless. 
Still, some people have a mean streak wrt squirrels.
8538 2018-05-05 18:45:26 Maybe in a way that will make it easier for me, any palm oil, just no! thank you
8539 2018-05-05 18:45:22 Hardly matters maam, despite your good work people think you ppl are equally corrupt because of nirav and lalit modi episode and ppl are not getting enough goodies like low tax and low oil price. Really sorry state of affairs. Next election is tough for BJP

8555 2018-05-05 18:42:49 "It is *most likely* that Nigeria will not amount to anything in our  lifetimes.  With oil inching close to $80/barrel, Nigeria's elite are back to their  old ways, having learned absolutely nothing during a period of low  prices.  This can easily go on for the next 5 decades."
8556 2018-05-05 18:42:36 They’re too busy praying for more oil to stop fracking
8557 2018-05-05 18:42:35 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
8558 2018-05-05 18:42:34 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
8559 2018-05-05 18:42:34 Put it in the oven with olive oil for like 2 hours, mixed it up a couple times. Add salt, pepper, and paprika when it’s done
8560 2018-05-05 18:42:22 Anyone who didn't back the tax cut that will bring trillions of tax dollars back to the US is a Globalist shmuck, & we are extremely aware the increase in oil prices are Globalist trying to erase any tax cut benefit for the working men & women. We know Dems hate the middle class.
8561 2018-05-05 18:42:21 Joe Joyce reminds me of that oil tanker truck in Duel. Just doesn't stop. Bloody hell.
8562 2018-05-05 18:42:14 Waiting for oil change at @Honda. @ladygaga comes on and staff sings along to Million Reasons.  Makes waiting 3 hours semi tolerable.

8572 2018-05-05 18:40:43 Every time I see coconut oil my dick jump cause I KNOW it makes the best lubricant
8573 2018-05-05 18:40:40 Read up on what's called oil pulling. It's an ayurvedic thing where you use edible coconut oil (purer form than hair oil) as a mouth wash for 20 mins and that whitens your teeth, it's good for the gums and if you have cavity, it actually 'pulls' cavity out and repairs teeth.Magic
8574 2018-05-05 18:40:25 I don’t understand why you would need to change the oil pan and gasket if it isn’t leaking. I’ve never heard of that as preventative maintenance. How many miles does the car have? And is you battery dead or dying? I’d test the battery at auto zone before anywhere else.

8579 2018-05-05 18:39:38 Well, since we don’t know what KIND of oil was used in the first place, we can’t make any assumptions on whether the owner was trying to harm it.
8580 2018-05-05 18:39:35 You want to reduce the deficit, reduce oil imports and guess what your bridges don’t help
8581 2018-05-05 18:39:34 How hot is it in my house? Just got enough to liquify an entire bottle of coconut oil 
8582 2018-05-05 18:39:33 Buy the oil and get big fe to do it... boom
8583 2018-05-05 18:39:19 Yeah, from Chitambo Zambia where he died, they annointed his body with certain oil and salt and put it in the curved log not to rot. Find this book "Scramble of Africa" by Thomas Pakenham.
8584 2018-05-05 18:39:07 After doing lots of research ( mainly as a school project with my kids!) ‘sustainable’ isn’t actually a thing yet... it is a goal. And palm oil companies who are members of the rspo are working towards a goal, and not actually at the end yet!

8589 2018-05-05 18:38:35 I did too! Until I learned what contango was and how USO badly suffered from it. Then I sold USO and bought oil royalty trusts (BPT, PBT, NDRO). Worked out OK but did not beat S&P. Sold the royalty trusts for BTC in 2015 
8590 2018-05-05 18:38:26 I hate when I get sick bc my mom has all these nasty ass home remedies but I’m at the point that I honestly don’t care. I’ll eat grilled garlic and drink olive oil.

Even then UPAs yearly average is above than Modis in India electrification.
Modi is nothing but a Gross Liar and a Failed PM (the first one ofcourse)
8599 2018-05-05 18:37:37 We need to realize we cannot coast on being an oil exporting nation anymore. One way to boost productivity around the country is to spur the different regions to produce by changing the structures, but that will require vision and time.

8604 2018-05-05 18:36:51 To put this in perspective (organic farm girl). This was the first time I’d *ever* bought vegetable oil, and it felt DIRTY (and not in a good way )

8619 2018-05-05 18:35:29 Given the negative externality associated with fuel combustion, $80/barrel oil may be welfare improving (ie still lower than the equilibrium price under optimal pigouvian tax).

Whereas no serious economist would make that claim for a trade war.

8623 2018-05-05 18:35:15 Ya I don't see it either, but he might get elected by those who work and benefit from the oil industry that are new to Alberta, or those that don't know that the price of Oil is determined by factors beyond Alberta's control. It's looking like Alberta's Economy was built on
8624 2018-05-05 18:35:10 Hey, can I have some oil, dis bitch is thirsty
8625 2018-05-05 18:35:09 A hydrating facial mask, earthy white, with coconut, tea tree oil, and exfoliating crushed lemon seed. It's a a flowery-smelling powder in a tub.
8626 2018-05-05 18:35:09 But.....but.... the Saudis are our friends! 

They sell us oil and buy our weapons! @theresa_may said so...
8627 2018-05-05 18:34:59 Oil and petroleum products are not the problem.  Burning oil and petroleum products is the problem.  It's disingenuous to pretend that if we stop burning oil we will have to stop making plastic.
8628 2018-05-05 18:34:57 Yeah government, Selling dirty oil they can

8645 2018-05-05 18:33:41 Usually disappointed eating at chain restaurants and #lazydogcafe is no exception.Salmon burger was lukewarm and devoid of tasty salmon oil.
8646 2018-05-05 18:33:39 When your 3rd spray tan ever goes horribly wrong, you use google to fix it and try lemon juice, sugar scrub, coconut oil, scrub brush, hydrogen peroxide, rubbing alcohol, and windex (!) to no avail.
8647 2018-05-05 18:33:35 I’m always so confused by Dr. Oz. On the one hand, snake oil salesman. On the other cardiothoracic with multiple Ivy League degrees... But why is he so full of shit? And round and round I go.
8648 2018-05-05 18:33:35 Have you ever had chili oil? A spoon full will certainly wake you up...! Or knock you down.
8649 2018-05-05 18:33:24 I should note that it only takes like 3 minutes to oil it.  Just heat it until you can’t keep your finger on the rim, apply like a teaspoon of oil and brush evenly.  Done deal.
8650 2018-05-05 18:33:16 Battery price seems fine, I have no base to judge the oil pan part
8651 2018-05-05 18:33:15 Also, the cure for cancer is either cannabis oil, b17, or rerum. If it was me, I would use all 3.

8667 2018-05-05 18:31:16 Just reading a blog on improving children school packed lunches. The suggestions include prawns, Goji berries, coconut oil, mango, raspberries etc... all great foods but that’s going to be pretty inaccessible to a lot of the population. Good nutrition doesn’t have to be costly.
8668 2018-05-05 18:31:16 That's a hook and lantern bird feeder. You stand corrected. 

The real issue here is that @curiousgawker is right: oil isn't good for bird feathers. 
My Q re the oil is: Transmission? 3-in-1? Mineral? Canola? Only one of these is safe for other wildlife.

8686 2018-05-05 18:29:35 DON'T you believe in equal rights. If I had boys, in my house the boys would know and do laundry. In my house girls know how to change the tire, oil, how to put a whole sheet of sheet rock to make the ceiling all by their self. Before marriage my dad cooked, cleaned & ironed.

8693 2018-05-05 18:27:56 We'll join EFTA then. With Scotland in EFTA not only would they have a near monopoly on North Sea oil but would also have as much annual fish stocks in their combined waters as the EU catch in a year. Some may see that as a good bargaining chip for EFTA.
8694 2018-05-05 18:27:41 I just Googled "cooking oil on plants".

8698 2018-05-05 18:27:09 cassy those are oil nuggets
8699 2018-05-05 18:27:03 Remember when Venezuela people came to Florida  to buy high price houses & condominiums when they found all that oil? I was a realtor treated us like peons.
8700 2018-05-05 18:27:02 There was no criminal invasion. They now live in the biggest democracy in the Middle East (1st in Iraq in thousands of years) and are not subject to random detentions, rape, and torture. They have massive oil reserves, a burgeoning private sector, and a lot of young people.

8709 2018-05-05 18:25:25 If you’re a female and haven’t ordered or used the Bali body tanning oil yet then srsly what are you doing??
8710 2018-05-05 18:25:23 How are you finish it off?  Stain?  Or maybe some linseed or tung oil?  That would look great with a tung oil finish and would be easy upkeep as well.
8711 2018-05-05 18:25:21 You tell em Trosty! ANYONE opposed to the pipeline is a paid protestor send by @JustinTrudeau himself! There can be no other explanation as to why people would be against moving oil through wetlands or over the ocean. It's unfair to China and the Oil Companies!  #CdnPoli
8712 2018-05-05 18:24:56 Who needs a man when you got weed infused olive oil that you can rub on your aching body but also cook with?

8716 2018-05-05 18:24:01 I honestly could eat this every day. The mustard oil is a very strong flavour though, so would be interested to know what @gwydionuk makes of it.

8730 2018-05-05 18:21:39 Apparently vitamin e oil is the best for clearing skin! I've been using recently and it's absolutely heavenly! It helps to repair skin and it's just an oil that you pop on to your face before bed!

8735 2018-05-05 18:21:16 Since the Chavez administration, there has been many cases of corruption with different presidents. Over the course of Venezuela’s recent history, oil has become their primary export which has led to it becoming their main source of government corruption and deceit.

8759 2018-05-05 18:18:29 Is it the melanin that makes the coconut oil pop or the coconut oil that makes the melanin pop? Either way, I’m wit it.
8760 2018-05-05 18:18:26 Yeah. That pipeline is definitely not something I ever expected from the NDP. But a bunch of craven idiots who want a quick buck by piping dirty oil all over the world are also NDP constituents, so here we are.
8761 2018-05-05 18:18:21 I bought 100% tea tree oil from Target, a lot of ppl say to dilute it w water. I just spot treatment apply a little bit to pimples, wait for a lil bit so it soaks in my skin and then put lotion on my face ! it's been working v well for me.

8763 2018-05-05 18:17:56 Russia is in chaos business these days, so it's unlikely there will be much advancement of peace in the ME.

Better to focus on eliminating dependence on oil.

8767 2018-05-05 18:17:26 Many researchers argue these “boom-bust cycles”, the natural up and down of the global demand for oil, hinder the economy and make it impossible to grow permanently. The false hope of increased revenues Venezuela sees is due to the constant up and down of global demand for oil.
8768 2018-05-05 18:17:20 Did my first ever oil change and I'm feeling proud  Always took my cars in to get serviced but my wife took the time to teach and show me

8771 2018-05-05 18:17:06 US domestic oil (fracking) gave Obama the flexibility to rely less on Saudi Arabia. The deal was good but pro-Saudi and pro-Israel factions hate the deal because they want the USA to be firmly in their pocket. 

Opponents of the deal don't judge the deal on the merits.

8774 2018-05-05 18:16:53 Venezuela has made itself reliant on a single export which has led to instability within the economy and forced them to rely on the global demand for oil, Worldwide demand for oil fluctuates often and is hard to predict due to the everchanging politics and demands of the world.
8775 2018-05-05 18:16:48 You missed the whole point. The BClibs don’t care about the sewage and they don’t care about the oil spillage. It’s all about donor $.

8782 2018-05-05 18:15:28 I need to get my oil changed today. Gives me time to read :)
8783 2018-05-05 18:15:26 Chavez used his power to promote himself in the eyes of foreign rulers by exploiting his country’s oil supply- offering it at a discount to get in the good graces of others while his own country struggled to stay afloat
8784 2018-05-05 18:15:21 I thought to myself, "What no ginger,  no oil flavor, how about the coconut?
8785 2018-05-05 18:15:17 Right about this time six years ago, I was crawling out of bed, later than my midwife told me to, to drink a castor oil milkshake.
8786 2018-05-05 18:15:11 Oil change and Brakes outta the way 
8787 2018-05-05 18:15:10 Besides their preference for plutocratic forms of government, the main source of revenue for the Kochs comes from their petrochemical industries, which means they share Putins determination to maintain oil dependence and fight to suppress renewable energy-Koch states penalize it
8788 2018-05-05 18:15:08 doing an oil change for the first time and feelin adult  i’m officially responsible and have a bright future ahead of me

8791 2018-05-05 18:14:57 I'm using Carrot Oil 
8792 2018-05-05 18:14:48 In fact, Venezuelan presidents have nationalized the oil industry and placed their officials in place of experienced workers. The corruption begins with Hugo Chavez seizing power by winning the election in 1998 and went on to transform Venezuela’s oil sector for the worse.
8793 2018-05-05 18:14:36 Dr. Oz has sold homeopathy and snake oil to the David Avocado nation for years. What better place for him than in a fake president's cabinet
8794 2018-05-05 18:14:21 my sister: “wow we’re getting our oil changes at the same time now” 
me: “yeah wow our periods have synchronized” 
8795 2018-05-05 18:14:19 I feel like veggie or olive oil would be fairly harmless
8796 2018-05-05 18:13:54 i'm going out with my family to go see an exhibit on the oil industry isn't that FASCINATING
8797 2018-05-05 18:13:52 He looks like Pauly on the Sopranos.  Hair slicked back while he holds tin foil to tan his face.  He is the epitome of a slimy NY snake oil salesman.
8798 2018-05-05 18:13:48 Jen posts,
Hi  for those that diffuse the copaiba essential oil, how long do you find it is effective for? Is it just as long as it is diffusing or does it continue to provide relief for a while afterwards? Thanks!

8800 2018-05-05 18:13:39 Corruption is present in many countries that lack the proper checks and balances in their government, and Venezuela is no exception. Their lack of structure and surplus of oil is a hotbed for corruption.
8801 2018-05-05 18:13:30 Hahahaha, I know, right?

Oil all the bird feeders :D
8802 2018-05-05 18:13:25 I hated myself for getting fenty’s lipgloss ...I hate the feeling so much it’s basically candy oil on your lips eeeeek
8803 2018-05-05 18:13:25 I just wanna be sitting in a field with 30 people with a jug of pimms infront of me smothered in oil
8804 2018-05-05 18:13:24 I like having my oil changed. It gives me three uninterrupted hours of knitting time.
8805 2018-05-05 18:13:23 last night I took a bubble bath w mineral salts, gave myself a mani/pedi, did a face/lip/eye mask, stretched, gave myself a massage w tension blend oil, put my phone away for the night & read, meditated, slept for 10 hours, & I feel so recharged/ready to conquer today
8806 2018-05-05 18:13:13 I started putting a mix of coconut oil+virgin olive oil in my hair and wow what a difference
8807 2018-05-05 18:12:44 extra virgin oil
8808 2018-05-05 18:12:42 Getting an oil change and the guy at the counter said we looked really conflicted....I’m wearing Packers stuff and my Fiancé is wearing Braves. Good thing I didn’t wear my Brewers stuff then. Lol
8809 2018-05-05 18:12:40 OK. What does that do to the oil tho, if it’s sunflower it can take high heat, but is that OK/healthy? Don’t want to nuke it. 
8810 2018-05-05 18:12:31 Whoever needs some oil cartridges for there pens HMU!!! I got good deal on them!! $20 half gram-$40 full gram
8811 2018-05-05 18:12:25 Chicken marinated in olive oil, garlic, lemon. parsley, smoked paprika and cumin, Sicilian burgers - made with sun dried tomatoes, olives, onion, basil and mozzarella with basil infused mayo and hot dogs for the kids? 
8812 2018-05-05 18:12:25 The oil industry in Venezuela has hindered the country’s economy because it has fostered corruption, forced the country to rely on one export, and has created a rigid social class system which has led to an increase in violence
8813 2018-05-05 18:11:50 Lube oil. Engine crankcases usually only had a single scavenging sump and pickup. Multiple pickups required pumps that wouldn't break suction when the pickup was unsubmurged.
8814 2018-05-05 18:11:47 There is no question crude oil plays a vital part in shaping the world seen today. Many countries play a part in the massive industry; however Venezuela has the most potential as they have the largest oil reserve in the world.
8815 2018-05-05 18:11:47 I haven't trusted Dr. Oz, since he got his own show and started selling "snake oil" products to America.
8816 2018-05-05 18:11:45 I like the oil painting better too...
8817 2018-05-05 18:11:26 A "healer" also was a Snake Oil salesman.

8819 2018-05-05 18:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza this Spring Sampler will be: day-old crust with stale motor oil and meat lovers.
8820 2018-05-05 18:10:39 @TestKitchen S19/EP14  Olive Oil Cake - question about wet ingredients: eggs and milk straight from fridge, or allow them to get to room temp?
8821 2018-05-05 18:10:26 It's also interesting to see indigenous groups counter the proposed restrictions on oil transportation on the basis that the gov. failed to adequately consult with indi. peoples. it just goes to show how the media, time and time again fails to objectively portray resource issues
8822 2018-05-05 18:10:21 たらこって美味いよな！
8823 2018-05-05 18:10:19 Coconut oil makes my lips superrrrr dry 
8824 2018-05-05 18:10:15 American domestic oil production has reduced global oil prices, helping improve the lives of billions of people and reducing the power of petro-state authoritarian regimes.

8827 2018-05-05 18:09:56 Haha well the cbd oil we use is tasteless so just delicious
8828 2018-05-05 18:09:51 I'd go back in time and start Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla,Apple and discover oil in the middle East and find Oprah!! Then I'd be the richest man that ever lived!!
8829 2018-05-05 18:09:31 Done with a complete oil change. My truck is pleased.
8830 2018-05-05 18:09:31 And look who's top, Scotland (and we've no oil) - get it right next time lads and lassies.
8831 2018-05-05 18:09:25 Car lights changed, oil done, car washed. Manliness levels rising
8832 2018-05-05 18:09:06 Indy turned Lucas Oil into a god damn swimming pool and Jon Freeman fell for it, hook, line and sinker. Influenced the game more than a ref should.
8833 2018-05-05 18:08:37 I could've sworn @Vangelus did a shock oil tutorial, but I can't find it for the life of me!
8834 2018-05-05 18:08:36 Oil changes take fucking forever
8835 2018-05-05 18:08:25 Rose oil> Coconut oil.

8838 2018-05-05 18:07:53 Do u know why America wanted middle east countries?OIL BRO OIL!
'SUPERPOWERS' bankrupted middle east countries..because they had oil and had potential to challenge 'SUPERPOWERS'..wars in middle east were initiated bcz of ego and greed..and when were opposed..they accused religion
8839 2018-05-05 18:07:48 The Labour governments of Wilson (1974-6) and Callaghan (1976-9) had to deal with the aftermath of the end of Bretton Woods (1971) and the oil shock provoked by the Yom Kippur War of 1973. Real wages fell as inflation of 25% was the order of things. House prices inflated hugely.
8840 2018-05-05 18:07:47 Everything that ever happens to a person can be cured with coconut oil, turmeric, and goji berries. So sayeth the Oz.
8841 2018-05-05 18:07:35 Lmao  so true. Probably they don’t know what oil change is.
8842 2018-05-05 18:07:13 So foul. The only men I have ever seen do this are con artists, fake evangelicals and snake oil entrepreneurs. Barf.
8843 2018-05-05 18:07:07 Someone really needs to oil the wheels on that kids bike. Ouch!
8844 2018-05-05 18:06:47 sniff snorf ah yes i love the smell of oil and machines
8845 2018-05-05 18:06:38 I cant cook i spilled hot oil on the floor n it splash my feet
8846 2018-05-05 18:06:36 Or throw it in the blender, add a banana and some olive oil and you have a bomb hair masque!
8847 2018-05-05 18:06:32 I prefer the slinky. The person who posted about the oil is correct. Plus also when she said "oil" I was thinking: transmission? 3-in-1? Mineral? or canola? Three of those are DEF NOT OK
8848 2018-05-05 18:06:31 Hai detto niente! Italian “simplicity” at its heights. And what about a slice of hot home made bread with just salt and good E.V. olive oil?
8849 2018-05-05 18:06:30 What in the world is an essential oil?
8850 2018-05-05 18:06:28 Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.

8854 2018-05-05 18:05:47 You could maybe put a climate change spin on Flood by Carbon Leaf but I'm not sure it's what they had in mind. Depends on how deep they meant to go with "too much oil on the wings is a dangerous thing."
8855 2018-05-05 18:05:38 I could hear the backpedaling from here.
8856 2018-05-05 18:05:27 Thanks Liz, that’s very sweet of you, but I look like I’ve swallowed an oil barrel. Not a great look.

8871 2018-05-05 18:03:52 I don't love them. I don't eat them, except for the rare occasions that I'm dying of hunger and there's nothing to eat but those lumps of oil 
8872 2018-05-05 18:03:42 It's cute and funny but I worry: what kind of oil? Olive, canola, transmission, engine? Not so funny if you think about it!
Another commenter posted about how oil's bad for bird feathers. He's right, but sass at him got all the likes.
8873 2018-05-05 18:03:28 Disproving the third law? No, just refining it. The problem with flat-Earth ideas is that they are NOT progressing. Most of their arguments from from a 19th-Century snake oil salesman. And most of the new arguments amount to "it's fake!"

8884 2018-05-05 18:01:57 If you use the cutting board for things like, you know, bread, how would the oil influence those items? Surely the oil would want to come out if the wood even after days of drying? #WoodworkingN00b

8890 2018-05-05 18:01:10 This castor oil got my beard looking pawpin
8891 2018-05-05 18:01:09 maybe try something like aloe vera gel and see how it helps. Use only a mild cleanser Cetaphil or Cerave make good ones get on Amazon or at Target. Then see how your skin reacts and start new. DE has NO chemicals and has soothing Marula oil which will help heal
8892 2018-05-05 18:00:58 oil price is about $80. Why should I hate him? What infrastructure? Do dead people make use of infrastructure? Security nko?

8897 2018-05-05 17:59:59 It uses literally 1/18 of the oil used to dry things now the science Idk that's googles job lol but I use it every time I fry something...my guess is because it just removes the moisture out of the food with hot air vs hot liquid
8898 2018-05-05 17:59:44 Couponing is fucking great. I just got an oil change and inspection for $17 bucks.
8899 2018-05-05 17:59:37 Why regulation & taxation of #oil and #gas is not only valid but critically important. Jobs are temporary, pollution is forever. Extractive industries by definition can not continue indefinitely. What will we do when they leave us w polluted land & no resources w which 2 recover?
8900 2018-05-05 17:59:31 That’s true if you value what the real dems value... Wall Street, Oil profits, more wars, romneycare for all, student debt.
8901 2018-05-05 17:59:26 Last year, Walker signed a bill that would let children suffering from crippling seizures have access to CBD oil.

8920 2018-05-05 17:54:18 We just got at the shop to get my oil changed and an inspection.

I asked Aaron to grab the insurance, and he found his half eaten burrito sitting there on top of the paperwork..

We have no idea how long it has been there or when we even had burritos.

This is marriage. 
8921 2018-05-05 17:54:00 There is no pain like tooth ache. Clove oil could help
8922 2018-05-05 17:53:59 What are these vehicles built out of? I hope not steel (coal) or plastic(oil), hope there is no lithium (child labor & strip mining) I hope no fossil fuels are used to transport the material to the factories or to power them. Remember these are all bad bad things to you Libs
8923 2018-05-05 17:53:53 Should I be worried if my engine oil light is coming on

8925 2018-05-05 17:53:33 When I was in Jr High I loved The Beastie Boys, Sir Mix-A-Lot (My Posse’s on Broadway), Red Hot Chili Peppers, Midnight Oil...& as a result was given tapes from the Christian “equivalents” for my birthday.
8926 2018-05-05 17:53:30 What kind of oil? I’ve tried everything
8927 2018-05-05 17:53:29 Indeed painful n I usually only apply sunblock so during that visit my skin was very dry it was super ugly i can't stand looking at myself in the mirror lol. next visit then i brought toner, cream, vaselin etc.  someone should gift him lotions or oil when winter comes. Haha

8929 2018-05-05 17:53:24 Please be kidding. I’m a DEVOUT animal lover, preferring animals over most people at times, and there’s NOTHING wrong w/preventing squirrels from gobbling up food intended for another species. The lil squirrel is just fine. Relax. I think it’s ingenious w/the oil...and funny!

8940 2018-05-05 17:51:57 What? No fuel injection system, 4 valves/cylinder, pistons, rings, cam shaft, timing belt, crank shaft, transmission, harmonic balancer, flywheel,, muffler,  alternator,  water pump, oil pump, fuel pump, starter motor, solenoid, radiator, oxygen sensor, catalytic converter...?
8941 2018-05-05 17:51:32 How can you say they’re not way better? Talk to people in Pittsburgh Or Ohio, much better. Also, here in New Mexico one of the poorest states our oil industry is booming. Lots of people working lots of money circulating.
8942 2018-05-05 17:51:11 West Texas Intermediate climbing steadily for last 20 days, now near US$70/bbl. The rest of Canada knows your whining level is linked to the oil price, so we're all hoping it keeps going up even if it means higher gas prices for us
8943 2018-05-05 17:51:04 plus, oil blows-up. think of all the train-rail explosions followed by un-containable fires that have been in the news over recent years. it's not a far stretch 2 recognize that "leaked oil" is a fire hazard & could in some case become a explosive one too. OIL=not safe+harmful
8944 2018-05-05 17:50:46 Tonight my husband and I dine on freshly baked ciabatta, drizzled with olive oil, shavings of parmesan cheese and rocket salad - plus 5 fishfingers and a massive dollop of ketchup. I don't understand why restaurants don't offer this.
8945 2018-05-05 17:50:41 Yes Obama made the USA the largest oil exporter in the world ???   Pipelines, less regulations  You and Airhead wouldn’t understand it.
8946 2018-05-05 17:50:30 Actually... you did bait and switch. It was about Tesla. About disrupting the auto industry. Not the battery industry. Or electric companies. Or oil companies. Or asphalt.
8947 2018-05-05 17:50:30 I just realized that the coconut Oil was the one I haven't used  the one I used is in the fridge.
8948 2018-05-05 17:50:24 Spending 100’s of millions United or City style isn’t realistic when you don’t have oil baron owners or the world’s biggest revenue. Simply not sustainable. Plus doesn’t exactly go hand in hand with trying to finance a new stadium.
8949 2018-05-05 17:50:14 How much oil remains?
8950 2018-05-05 17:50:10 I am. He is calling insurance so he can get a rental car. So while he waits for that, I go get fucked before I take my car to get an oil change.
8951 2018-05-05 17:50:07 Please do. Sounds great. Add some oil and it’ll be similar to an Argentinian salsa criolla.
8952 2018-05-05 17:49:57 What’s the point of making an appointment to get your oil changed if your still going to have to wait 2 hours
8953 2018-05-05 17:49:53 I have to say, I've thrown so much at this Cobalt. Over 170k miles, boosted for 2/3 of its life on a stock motor. Leaking oil in 3 different places, and still running. How is this thing still running? I wonder how others are doing?
8954 2018-05-05 17:49:36 dont like oil filter but otherwise it looks cool
8955 2018-05-05 17:49:32 Sharpie oil based pen works real good with touch up or on little yellowing but if you wanna do the whole boost then that will take some time with sharpie. You can go to Walmart a grap one if you don’t want to wait
8956 2018-05-05 17:49:30 Don't forget 1 hour from now I am having an essential oil party at my house! Door prize raffles, wine, snacks and fun! PM me for address!

8962 2018-05-05 17:48:54 Yes for my brows I use a spoolie. I just brush thru them. Then for my eyelashes, I use a tiny thin brush and put the oil right at the root of the hairs.
8963 2018-05-05 17:48:53 Cuando el Rockefeller Center se empezó a construir, en Buenos Aires el edificio Kavanahg ya existía.

8978 2018-05-05 17:46:25 Plus I dropped my car off for servicing and oil change at 8am this morning. I had an appointment. It’s STILL not ready. Why is everyone trying me today
8979 2018-05-05 17:46:00 Come in today and meet Tony from Zoes, Ginette from St. Albert's, and Kim from Roadapple Ranch, and sample the fine products that there people produce.

Tony is currently serving up thin-sliced pork tenderloin topped with Fig and Star Anise Confit and Chili-Infused Olive Oil!
8980 2018-05-05 17:45:44 I'm more thinking when the program is done. The sudden drop in oil price facilitating the need to keep T-90 in production and delays of T-14 chassis also meaning SPG is on T-90 chassis all signs of overreach and poor budgeting.
8981 2018-05-05 17:45:43 Using factor 6 oil and it burnt me

8990 2018-05-05 17:44:34 You can get longer nails by applying olive oil to help them grow.
8991 2018-05-05 17:44:34 To me it was common sense. They’re were already uprising’s & we had our foot on their throat & we not only let off but gave the cash & unfreeze their assets & let them sell oil. Seems pretty stupid to me. Guess others can think different but look where we are now
8992 2018-05-05 17:44:34 lot ppl use the oil based sharpie pen. I don’t care for em. I use sneakerER midsole pens. They’re a lil most money. But worth it IMO. I have used both. Sharpie can get from amazon. SneakerER can get from their website but shipping kills it. Or SNS carries it, grab wen cop a pair

9038 2018-05-05 17:39:53 Go Check the facts, not the tales from the right wing unionist press. Are you going to pay us for all of the oil?
9039 2018-05-05 17:39:43 it'd be so so difficult to summarize years of trial and error and research into tweets but essentially we spend decades stripping our hair of natural oils and then reconditioning with products and that impacts the way our scalps produce and distribute oil in VERY long term ways!
9040 2018-05-05 17:39:34 I bet you you’re the only one that can see them! We are always too hard on ourselves. The Luna Oil by Sunday Riley is CF/vegan and is a retinol oil so it has anti aging properties. We just got the trial size last week and we’ve been trying it out at night, so far we like it!

9068 2018-05-05 17:36:10 I’m at Starbucks because I’m adulting and getting buster a much needed oil change 
9069 2018-05-05 17:36:05 Pan searing I season with salt and pepper then cook them in olive oil with rosemary, butter and garlic

Grilling I just lightly season with salt n pepper and garlic salt. I will usually finish them off with some butter while they're resting.

I like steak to stay simple
9070 2018-05-05 17:36:03 Figured you for a Sally Kohn guy
9071 2018-05-05 17:35:51 So he likes the guns that shoot bullets slow?
9072 2018-05-05 17:35:21 :)
9073 2018-05-05 17:35:16 In 1940, President Cardenas addresses a message to the nation restating that oil assets will not be returned to foreign companies and will not accept the US Department of State proposal.
9074 2018-05-05 17:34:50 It’s taking longer & longer to shop and make sure you’re getting pure ingredients when you want to make something..flour, cornmeal, milk, oil, butter, etc. Make your voice heard on this. Big Ag is manipulative.
9075 2018-05-05 17:34:38 I sit back and watch the World through Eyeholes in my oil paintings
9076 2018-05-05 17:34:03 What "Peace" prize does Trump deserve when he's divided America in the most evil way possible? Denounced Africans, immigrants, Muslims, Blacks, invested in an oil company who viciously abused Native Americans! Giving him an award is TRICKNOLOGY at its best!!
@DJergentz
9077 2018-05-05 17:33:26 Why is North America still talking about building new pipelines you ask.  Because the world is going to be dependent on oil for a long time to come.
9078 2018-05-05 17:33:14 NO BLOOD FOR OIL 時代のガキさん
9079 2018-05-05 17:33:03 LMFAO I need job oil not to be someone's gf, pls do you have that, I need a job asap
9080 2018-05-05 17:33:00 That’s because NDs like to prescribe nostrums and magic snake oil to scared, vulnerable patients, for made-up illnesses. So yeah, MDs ain’t gonna do that.
9081 2018-05-05 17:32:59 Executive summary of Arnab Goswami debate: Hitler, Jinnah, Genghis Khan, Ché, Babur, Savarkar, Giddafi, Mao, Aurangzeb (PS: I think Pol Pot was left out because Vietnam has no oil)
9082 2018-05-05 17:32:51 That’s besides the point  The point is you need to replace oil and gas with solar, wind, geothermal, and hydro: build new renewable to replace old fossil. This clearly involves a transition over time. No one said it could happen overnight
9083 2018-05-05 17:32:41 I didn’t get a biz card from her - she’s at the Bird-in-Hand Amish market. (The one with the Conestoga wagon out front) Her stall has wooden kids toys and bird houses in it & around the register is bug creams, pain salves & cbd oil! I was there for the bug cream & left w/ more!
9084 2018-05-05 17:32:08 wow oil really doesnt work well with me
i had like 3 pieces of onion rings and my stomachs killing me and ive been feeling sick the whole time
9085 2018-05-05 17:32:02 my olive oil called me a virgin im pretty fucking hurt right now
9086 2018-05-05 17:32:01 theres SO many men who dont know how to change a tire, dont know that they should continue to get an oil change after buying car, dont know how to basic handy work around the house... that’s not a type i could willingly sign up with.
9087 2018-05-05 17:31:30 L'oreal Extraordinary Oil.
9088 2018-05-05 17:31:16 Oil is considered agriculture in Texas, isn't it?
9089 2018-05-05 17:31:05 Your anointing oil don finish? Check for Idumagbo, they get Am there
9090 2018-05-05 17:30:54 there’s a really cute girl working at this oil change place wtf...
9091 2018-05-05 17:30:44 What weapons does he think shoot slow bullets?
9092 2018-05-05 17:30:41 I’m out in the middle of the west Texas oil fields so thankfully, I have no way of watching the game.
9093 2018-05-05 17:30:31 Remember the Obama years when his Administration was shutting down the coal industry
 The oil drilling . The power plants the Factories. And on live proud of when he accomplished said on live tv ( those jobs are never coming back. What's he got a magic wand.) Speaking of Trump.
9094 2018-05-05 17:30:28 Like CA, I think some people don't realize how diverse Texas' agriculture and resources are.
It isn't just oil and steers.
9095 2018-05-05 17:30:28 At night massage castor oil or coconut oil on it. The beard doesn’t take a long time to thicken up for me.
9096 2018-05-05 17:30:28 buys a tea because it smells like my money oil and I need ALL THE MONEY
9097 2018-05-05 17:30:23 he just needs to shower, cut his hair, and use oil blotting sheets and then he’ll be daddy again
9098 2018-05-05 17:29:43 Yes I am my legs itching bad ass hell I just put coconut oil on it
9099 2018-05-05 17:29:42 We are glad you enjoy our Lavender oil! It is such a nice and calming oil! Thank you for sharing!
9100 2018-05-05 17:29:41 They see the truth of the matter. Pruitt is a Trump nominee to the Environmental Protection Agency. He does not believe in global warming, breaks laws while going on vacations using taxpayer dollars, and is literally undermining clean energy because he was bought out by big oil.
9101 2018-05-05 17:29:37 Motor oil
9102 2018-05-05 17:29:32 Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing psalms. Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.
9103 2018-05-05 17:29:23 And just like that, without warning, the coconut oil has melted.
9104 2018-05-05 17:29:18 Strain/filter it & use it again? When I was a lad, I remember a pan of oil sitting on the stove that was used multiple times for frying chip, etc. ??
9105 2018-05-05 17:29:04 @stefsaul @EricaLG good article on Koch’s. Suggest you look into enormous donations to universities by Middle East oil billionaires
9106 2018-05-05 17:28:43 Gas and Oil are really useful though, and almost definitely have intrinsic value to every person who invested in those ETFs. 

Unless they were innuits.
9107 2018-05-05 17:28:34 If u don’t damn near bathe in coconut oil we can’t date 
9108 2018-05-05 17:28:15 @EricaLG good article on Koch’s. Suggest you look into enormous donations to universities by Middle East oil billionaires

9114 2018-05-05 17:27:33 JUNIOR SALES OIL #lavoro #Bakeky
9115 2018-05-05 17:27:08 Cenk, these scandals don’t change the fact that 21 state elections were hacked, and a massive oil deal that would absolve debt for Trumps and Kushners in exchange for lifted sanctions is likely why we’re in this mess. Why don’t you and Judd cover that?
9116 2018-05-05 17:27:06 Yes but he's not entirely accurate either as oil is a bit of a sunset industry and if I recall, he doesn't include central bank debt in his explanations.
9117 2018-05-05 17:26:55 @eatyourkimchi just saw your #buildyourladder video and wanted to say you are super strong and to keep it up. Also make sure to try if you can CBD oil. It helps with inflammation and pain and helps me with my arthritis A LOT.  Keep smiling!!
9118 2018-05-05 17:26:34 U.S. Adds One Natural Gas Rig, With Oil Drilling Still Ramping Up
9119 2018-05-05 17:26:15 Put it on the plants/garden...?? Dont take my word for it though. My oil generally goes down the toilet, and someone might tell me that's wrong..
9120 2018-05-05 17:26:13 I got baby oil, rum & beer, will that suffice?
9121 2018-05-05 17:25:14 Rub mixture of oil pepper salt&spices over pork then heat in oven until its brown.reduce heat and cook till its copper brown in the center

9125 2018-05-05 17:24:23 Nothing bothers me more than explains transmission work to a dude that can’t even change his own oil and acts like he knows it all  FOOHWTBS
9126 2018-05-05 17:24:21 Reason why I am more outspoken about today than I am about St Patrick's Day.

I live in a small town that is full of oil field boys and college students thanks to our university.
My town has an alcohol problem.
People don't get so drunk on St Patrick's Day here like they do today
9127 2018-05-05 17:24:19 So Hogg calling for boycotts all over the place is extreme? Thought so. Glad Kirsten sees it our way
9128 2018-05-05 17:24:11 Nutrition Tip: Enjoy the Health Benefits of Coconut Oil

Coconut oil has benefits ranging from helping with fat loss, to boosting the immune system and improving bone density.  Not to mention it's the healthiest oil to cook with.  If you haven't switched to coconut oil, DO IT!
9129 2018-05-05 17:24:04 Maduro deveria cambear oil por comida.
9130 2018-05-05 17:23:38 When u see laden tankers on anchorage and oil prices going up ... u know something is cooking #shipping #oil
9131 2018-05-05 17:23:35 ★★★★★ Bought the Full Spectrum Pet CBD Oil, High Grade Hemp Extract (50mg/ml) - 1450mg CBD (30ml), check out my review!
9132 2018-05-05 17:23:30 There’s a little brush that comes with the Andis. I use that to remove excess hair, then witch hazel on my straight edge razor and all other blades for germ removal after. Then the oil.
9133 2018-05-05 17:23:11 with all due respect......these kids probably can't change oil or a tire....I don't think they have the mental capacity to change the Constitution.
9134 2018-05-05 17:22:53 My non-tweeting husband asked me to tweet asking for ideas for where to take our Vespa for an oil change. @stephenoshea @stickers66?
9135 2018-05-05 17:22:44 Better if you were watching the plutonium...you'd be bored, but at least the stuff would be found. As Midnight Oil has taught us; "...once the stuff gets in, you cannot get it out...".
9136 2018-05-05 17:22:42 KAILANGAN KO MADAMING CASTOR OIL AND LEMON FUCKKKKKK
9137 2018-05-05 17:22:40 After several attempts all the oil will rub on to the squirrels fur and the pole won't be so slippery anymore thereby getting it to access the bird feeder.

9140 2018-05-05 17:22:23 CBD oil has .3% THC abd it’s  legal to sell in all 50 states. Message me if your interest in making money selling it. You can put in it a big ass tobacco bag if you really want 
9141 2018-05-05 17:22:17 they need to hurry up w my damn oil change 
9142 2018-05-05 17:22:11 So.....not black dudes then. We gotta do our skin and hair and shit so we're not out here being crusty. Long hair needs that oil and short hair needs that grease.
9143 2018-05-05 17:22:09 China, India and the EU did not agree to stop buying Iranian oil in order to achieve the foreign policy objectives of Likud.
9144 2018-05-05 17:22:02 A bit like an oil painting
9145 2018-05-05 17:21:47 So, Karaage chicken’s a big hit in my house, but since I’ve never really eaten deep (or shallow) fried food at home, what do I do with the leftover oil? I live in a Victorian maisonette, and I really don’t want to put it down the drain. 
9146 2018-05-05 17:21:22 Interested to switch my career to oil and gas sector. Which one will be better drilling technology or certificate in oil and gas production.
9147 2018-05-05 17:21:06 I'm right there for it, too :D (afaict, in Western culture most socially acceptable ways for women to eat healthy natural fats are: olive oil on salad, nuts, avocados, real ice cream & cookies, cakes & muffins.  (mind you, even eatg unhealthy fats more accptble than fatty meats)

It would also limit any leverage foreign oil countries & companies think they have!  CUOMO wants to bankrupt U so u rely on gvt 4 everything! @marcmolinaro
9151 2018-05-05 17:20:23 Yes a very good point about federal reserve also bank of england i heard.i just feel with the fees saved using this in the oil industry will bring xrp to a great value personal opinion but keen to hear others.
9152 2018-05-05 17:20:23 I did get the mower started.  It was iffy for a minute or three. Oil changed. Suppose I need to mow..
9153 2018-05-05 17:20:22 ขอบคุณค้าา ทุกช่องทางเลยย
9154 2018-05-05 17:19:56 Dear CAPP...as mentioned before you must raise your profile. Educate educate educate. Take out TV ads, radio ads etc. You are very well funded by the Oil industry and you need to represent a proud industry much better and other than an occasional tweet!
9155 2018-05-05 17:19:30 This dude at the car wash hasn’t had an oil change in a few years?! God damn
9156 2018-05-05 17:19:27 Lots of locals work in the oil industry, it has been very good for us. Stop the class envy. Love your neighbor. #akleg
9157 2018-05-05 17:19:25 Fertilizer for their lawn? to clean oil spills for their car?
9158 2018-05-05 17:19:23 Lolol RT @ImLordMA512: Niggas mouths bleeding bc they wanna eat a fukkin hard shell. Get that shit outta here and put my tortillas in that cooking oil...
9159 2018-05-05 17:19:21 Going on a solid hour now. This is why I hate doing oil changes at the dealership. I’m only here cuz their dumbass salesman didn’t bother to tell my car didn’t come with a spare. Like seriously? At least tell the people and give them the option of purchasing one.
9160 2018-05-05 17:19:20 I had USO exposure 10+ years ago, believing “peak oil” was around the corner (thanks Charles Maxwell). That turned out poorly for me.
9161 2018-05-05 17:18:59 オイルだって怒るんだぞ怒ったら引火してギトギトのボーボーにしてやるからな
9162 2018-05-05 17:18:44 Surprisingly nothing crazy, but more tires, a stash of cigarettes with lighters, motor oil and more 1/2 full bottles of alcohol and other unknown liquids than I hoped to find. One bag was quite full of urine. #ich #notinmymarshland
9163 2018-05-05 17:18:37 Factor 2 carrot oil I’m using... chuck some of tha on
9164 2018-05-05 17:18:34 Why will you continue to rebel? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint. From the sole of the foot even to the head, there is no soundness in it, but bruises and sores and raw wounds; they are not pressed out or bound up or softened with oil. (Isaiah 1:5–6, ESV)
9165 2018-05-05 17:18:29 the dude changing my oil just told me he follows me on instagram i’m hollering
9166 2018-05-05 17:18:22 This man came and showed me something with oil on it telling me my oil was clean like I’m supposed to know what dirty oil looks like 
9167 2018-05-05 17:18:20 As implied by the article the uncertainty is costly, but if #Trump imposes unilateral #sanctions on #Iran it is highly unlikely that we will have a substantial drop in #oil exports & that the market will react in the same way as it did a few years ago with multilateral sanctions.
9168 2018-05-05 17:17:59 Groundnut, oil, grass, carrot and fish
9169 2018-05-05 17:17:50 ダメです！

9171 2018-05-05 17:17:43 Attention City of Hughson residents: We’re here at the corner of Tully Road and Walker Lane for the citywide clean up. Come on down and bring your hazardous material household items like paint and used oil and get a free oil container!
9172 2018-05-05 17:17:34 So stop making trade deals that ship working people's job overseas and stop trampling on FN rights by opening oil pipelines like Harper did every other month.
9173 2018-05-05 17:17:31 Last night I burned myself with hot oil to make some fries. Now I have 3 distinct burn marks on my arm ._.

9179 2018-05-05 17:16:45 Me tried my motor with new oil. It was so smooooth !!!!

G lama bakal ngisi oli lagi di gardannya sih buat nglunturin kerikil2 kampret yg masuk gara2 kecerobohan mekanik !!!
Uhmm.. klo g salah istilahnya flushing.
9180 2018-05-05 17:16:38 Gerry..you missed Scheers point entirely. Trudeau and your policies have segregated the West. The Oil and Gas Industry has been destroyed and jobs have been lost by hard working Westerners...back to your cave please.....
9181 2018-05-05 17:16:09 I mean blocking oil drilling with your luxary boat is using privilege for good.
9182 2018-05-05 17:16:08 That sounds icky--this involves coconut oil and ghee. And it's not about smarter as much as more alert, less hypoglycemic. But there's mixed opinions on whether it works.
9183 2018-05-05 17:15:58 I understand the pain that’s what happens when you try to mix oil with water
9184 2018-05-05 17:15:51 i’m bringing some home after i get my oil changed queen !
9185 2018-05-05 17:15:49 The price of oil will raise up 
9186 2018-05-05 17:15:48 It's always Glasgow.  Never Aberdeen.  Too busy in Aberdeen getting oil out of the North Sea to keep the Glasgow wasters in the style to which they have become accustomed.  Like everything Free.
9187 2018-05-05 17:15:35 Finally got my my oil changed
9188 2018-05-05 17:15:25 Really? TSA, Increased non oil revenue, social intervention programs, agric, etc.

Fresh rosemary sprigs
Minced garlic
Basil
Cayenne pepper
Smoked paprika

We will find out later after I grill em I guess

9194 2018-05-05 17:15:00 I had my hair in braids for three weeks. My coworker asked me if I go out tonight if I’ll rock my wild curls. Heck yeah. I’ve been only putting coconut oil and castor oil in my hair. It’s about to strong and beautiful and my curls are going to do bouncy! 
9195 2018-05-05 17:14:40 My actual skincare tips? Don't sleep in your makeup, drink lots of water, Nivea is cheap and awesome, and rub a few drops of Bio Oil in to your face once a week after a hot bath

9198 2018-05-05 17:14:26 More folk turned up at the hearing to find out what you done with the oil paintings .....by the way where are they?
9199 2018-05-05 17:14:25 They are amazing - if they are steeped in sunflower oil for a few weeks & then the oil makes a fab muscle rub!! And you can eat them, turn them into wine, and roasted root is supposed to taste like coffee......!!
9200 2018-05-05 17:14:20 He wants us to get suppressed 300 blackouts that fire sub sonic bullets. WTF, I love this dude now!
9201 2018-05-05 17:14:17 Nope. Oil companies haven't even gone through their land based leases yet. Why destroy the oceans now? States rights, you know, Or is that only convenient when you want states' rights?
9202 2018-05-05 17:14:13 The US is still a net oil importer, 3.7 mb/d last year. At that rate each $1 up costs us roughy $1.4bn a year.
9203 2018-05-05 17:14:02 Well you must eat healthy and don't need the extra oil.  But you could get shaved up in a video someday maybe  haha lofi zeitgiest shaving in a bathroom mirror...imagine that..
9204 2018-05-05 17:14:00 A13: What also impresses me about #avocados is how many ways you can use them: in oil, on toast, in guac, etc. #GuacIsExtra #AvocadosFromMexico #gno
9205 2018-05-05 17:13:59 @AlexWitt Great economic news. Unless you are retired and have to buy gasoline. How do we give him credit for rising oil prices?
@MSNBC is a great network. Keep it up.
9206 2018-05-05 17:13:29 I also don't believe that we should have any involvement with nations in the ME. Our need for the oil that our companies found on their soil is falling everyday. We should just contain their wars to their region of the World & sort it all out when they finish killing each other.
9207 2018-05-05 17:12:45 i've got the same problem aaaah-- a few days a week. i try to avoid meds most days bc overuse (like 3+ times a week) gives me even more headaches but sometimes u just need it to gO AWAY!! peppermint oil headache sticks are nice if u havent tried!!
9208 2018-05-05 17:12:39 Hair is growing! I like to use milks & products w. aloe in my hair. I also think oil is important too. I use that often b/c I'm african.
9209 2018-05-05 17:12:36 It just shifts. High oil shifts demand from destroying habitats to choosing housing closer to work. Sparks choice of transit. Reduces congestion. $80 only? I hope it gets to $160 to make our country great.

9211 2018-05-05 17:12:29 Not only is it getting recovered but that BP oil spill off the Louisiana didn't stop you from buying gas did it?
9212 2018-05-05 17:12:21 Why is the U.S exporting oil?  Aren't we suppose to be self sufficient?
9213 2018-05-05 17:12:20 it’s only noon and i have already:
- gotten my car inspected and got an oil change
- washed my car
- got starbucks and chick fil a for lunch 

9214 2018-05-05 17:12:20 The steam from the water helps cook vegetables to make them healthy (as in no heaps of oil needed) and also deglazes the pan to incorporate any bits that get stuck because those are flavour bits! Mmm flavour bits.
9215 2018-05-05 17:12:16 pretty good overview of additive in Aerospace, Automotive, Medical, Oil&Gas, & consumer goods. Was very high level, but also really good to hear @JohnFlannery_GE speak candidly about GE & their direction in additive, without sounding salesy. Also nice that it was in our backyard

9238 2018-05-05 17:09:39 How does the avg US citizen benefit from increased production? We hav plenty of production 2 Supply our needs yet we pay whatever the global mkt is willing 2 pay. We pay what non-producing countries pay, yet still subsidize oil/gas. Saudi’s pay $0.50/gal at pump? We are stupid.
9239 2018-05-05 17:09:34 Whilst things are still at the test an evaluation stage what advantages do you get from an LPD over a chartered oil support vessel? 
They offer an large flat deck to attach equipment to, high capacity craneage and in the current market low charter rates.

9245 2018-05-05 17:09:07 I just shave with a electric shaver ... no beard oil or anything 
9246 2018-05-05 17:09:01 After this hot oil treatment and shower I’m on the way

9252 2018-05-05 17:08:34 Maybe. More likely people who, like basically everyone in the USA, have been relentlessly propagandized for a century by Big Car, Big Oil, Big Roadbuilder, Big Suburban Developer, et al. to believe solo private cars are natural while 5,000 years of urban living were a fluke.

9257 2018-05-05 17:07:35 What kind of oil? That squirrel will now be licking it's paws. She might very well be harming it in the end. Vaseline would be a good alternative if that's not what it is already. Cooking oil maybe.
9258 2018-05-05 17:07:29 I take an eye dropper of Hemp Oil very day. I feel like I'm 20 something again.

9263 2018-05-05 17:06:19 Besides being FALSE, its the USA who has invaded Mexico with evil policies: backed corruption by PRI PAN govts, privatizing oil, militarizing society for a fake WarOnDrugs, making ppl poorer, raising IMPUNITY on govt & organized crime assasinations.

9275 2018-05-05 17:04:00 No one seems to be mentioning the millions of people who are palm oil intolerant ~ it's insidious, it's disastrous and not just ecologically ~ palm oil can seriously damage human health as well
9276 2018-05-05 17:03:58 Now it's time to hit up local comic books store for free comics and sesame oil. That's not a graphic novel, I'm just out of sesame oil. #FCBD2018 #cooking

9278 2018-05-05 17:03:36 I do! Everyday. I love it cause i have sensitive eye areas and most makeup removers would burn my skin. So once I used coconut oil it was the best. I swear it even made my eyelashes grow longer cause it’s natural and it helped fade my dark circles.  I  it. 
9279 2018-05-05 17:03:29 if you decide to bleach it, i'd recommed BLUE bleach or color b4 which i have never personally tried. and use coconut oil before bleaching
9280 2018-05-05 17:03:21 I was supposed to be at the nail shop and getting an oil change. Instead, I’m in the bed
9281 2018-05-05 17:03:13 I sell CBD oil also to help pay for my sons prosthetic leg and future leg surgery. I was thinking about contacting some on the Amish to see if they would like to buy wholesale from me but not sure how to approach them.
9282 2018-05-05 17:03:13 Ireland's are so good at this stuff. They're getting rid of palm oil in their stuff, too!

9285 2018-05-05 17:02:42 there's a lot of stuff you could do without bleaching your hair but they're not really effective ways and about half of them are super harmful. i'd recommed crushed vitamin c masks, dandruff shampoo and oil treatments
9286 2018-05-05 17:02:38 France & some other EU members are still doing quite a bit of business with Iran (Oil, Airplanes, etc..).
9287 2018-05-05 17:02:31 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
9288 2018-05-05 17:02:24 So glad you get to hold her
9289 2018-05-05 17:01:45 As far as big oil is concerned, gasoline is subsidized by the government, to the tune of $20 a gallon, lowering the price to $3.50 or whatever it is in your area.
If we put this same subsidy on alternative energy, you would make like $15 every time you charged your car.
9290 2018-05-05 17:01:42 I adore you @mishacollins but I have great concern for your lips. They seem like they're always chapped. I just feel like I need to slather coconut oil on you. For Chuck's sake, please take care of yourself. You're basically all we have left in this world. #angellips #SPN

I'm on t'other side. Nothing has been proven yet as to how we'd cope financially (and the oil thing was proven to be a load of waffle)
I'm still yet to see a strong case to sway me!

9310 2018-05-05 16:59:24 Sisi, your story might be different does not mean it is impossible. The job market in Calgary has been experiencing a slump because of oil, but you should not insinuate that it is nor true

9328 2018-05-05 16:56:50 I think if you’re in the oil spill business, you’d be continually praying for one! There’s plenty of evidence out there, brought to you by the folks not in the business of oil spills, that is far more reliable and accurate.

9339 2018-05-05 16:55:33 Too itchy and would bankrupt me from all the beard oil I would need.
9340 2018-05-05 16:55:30 I prefer using virgin coconut oil as a lip moisturizer day or night 
9341 2018-05-05 16:55:30 This is very good. Or like in one of my oil and gas type cases, we could scent the paper subtly like west texas.
9342 2018-05-05 16:55:24 1st batch of the oil ! That Shuld be 2weeks naw
9343 2018-05-05 16:55:16 Sat on a sun lounger putting factor 50 sun cream on, and there’s people slapping olive oil on themselves.

9349 2018-05-05 16:54:29 I’m at a convention center for my son’s job fair.  Also going on here today:

- A MLM Beauty products company Leadership summit

- a kids talent competition 

- a meeting of “oil chemists”

- A Yu-Gi-Oh! Tournament run by a FLGS.  

Watching these crowds intermix is priceless.
9350 2018-05-05 16:53:18 They so nasty lmfao. It might be because mine was warm but I’ve had a cold vanilla and it tasted like if I drank oil straight out of my car

9352 2018-05-05 16:53:18 Why is this treacherous man still given a platform? He is not a Labour spokesperson. The media again talking to the ‘oil rag’ not the engine...
9353 2018-05-05 16:53:17 That’s awesome. What kind of oil?
9354 2018-05-05 16:53:13 Me: How do you say oil in Spanish?
Adam: WD-40.
Me: I hate you.
9355 2018-05-05 16:53:12 Bit of Nuln Oil and you’re done.

9357 2018-05-05 16:53:07 There might be a solar vessel here or there trying to prove a point, much like Earthrace did with B100, but I don't see it implemented into wide spread commercial use. Most likely scenario is continued use of bunker oil with catalytic tech.

9432 2018-05-05 16:40:29 Thank you :’) it’s basically you have a table and on one side you put lots of cups containingn disgusting things (vinegar, olive oil, mustard, egg or anything you can drink)
9433 2018-05-05 16:40:27 Well, a lot of the produce is local,  but probably not the outstanding olives!! Hopefully Jamie will confirm where they are from.

9440 2018-05-05 16:39:43 Liberal scientists? Explain how saudi has worlds 2nd largest oil reserve and was once lush forest now a desert. Manmade? Dinosaurs pollute their war to sand? How are mammals like mastadons found above actic circle if it wasnt foragible ground. Eat snow? Man made warming? Doubtful
9441 2018-05-05 16:39:30 I'm hoping it's more inspection than work this year. But, as always, we're chasing an oil leak.

9447 2018-05-05 16:38:27 6-2also，add oil together
9448 2018-05-05 16:38:25 My thinking with this is I still get to 'infuse' the garlic flavour into the oil, and by heating it up slowly it has more time to hang out in the pan. Then cranking up till it's hot enough add the other ingredients (which happens soon enough since carbon woks heat quickly)
9449 2018-05-05 16:38:12 SHOUT OUT TO MY PARENTS FOR RESCUING ME A SECOND WEEKEND IN A ROW BECAUSE MY CAR WONT HOLD OIL NOW 
9450 2018-05-05 16:38:08 Can you please stop with the economic uncertainty game. The oil and gas industry is a dying industry. We are doing better than the rest of the country even without it. No it doesn't. The sky isn't falling.
9451 2018-05-05 16:38:04 Perhaps Agra city is very polluted,all types of it. Not only Agra but adjoining Mathura where a big oil refinery is located is also polluted. Half hearted measures or working just for Taj won't help anymore. Whole ecosystem Needs to be streamlined.
9452 2018-05-05 16:37:54 I'm on team Darryl, but Oil fans see a top end that just isn't there. I'm sure Chia will pay for the potential offense though.

9467 2018-05-05 16:36:20 Oil companies are very good at agreeing with one another for price, without even considering the true value on the market. Behaviour goes against every rules of capitalism. It makes for fast & large profits, but it's also one of the ways to bring economy crashing down.

9470 2018-05-05 16:35:50 But if the issues of ‘incompetence’ border on issues that run against his so called principles such as:-openness, honesty,probity,morality etc, shouldn’t he sack them as water & oil can’t mix??

9478 2018-05-05 16:34:28 During the 1980s, inflation and interest rates came down, oil and gas prices fell, taxes were cut, 16 million jobs were created and the unemployment rate fell, as the economy boomed.  Most importantly, the Soviet Union collapsed without the US having to fire a shot.

9482 2018-05-05 16:33:55 Was able to get out of oil sands & environmental messes but pickings remain slim; now investing in some companies I don’t like but who don’t damage our earth. It’s a hard / to support companies invested in the future of the earth can mean risking our personal $ future
9483 2018-05-05 16:33:48 hot oil splashed onto my arm earlier so now there's burns on it but there's this one burn that looks like an elephant's nose
9484 2018-05-05 16:33:46 Bunny’s high school swarmed with charming young feminine things.
It was impossible to escape them, especially when his father’s wealth & social standing caused many of them to set after him.

9485 2018-05-05 16:33:38 My twitter friends help a girl out. So i have this dry af spot on the ends of my hair. Obvi it’s damaged from my straightener but nothing is working. I’m currently trying coconut oil but what else can i possibly use?
9486 2018-05-05 16:33:34 Jesus is my assurance and i use anointed Goya olive oil...so i'm good tenz
9487 2018-05-05 16:33:29 Many oil Co's have 0 or negative free cash flow.. feel like they can't afford to roll the dice when it comes to hedging vs not hedging.. But ultimately, if Ur not generating much/any FCF, it makes for a bad/uninteresting equity investment over the long term
9488 2018-05-05 16:33:24 Background: Comes from Edo period hair oil salesmen who took their time chitchatting with the customers when selling.
9489 2018-05-05 16:33:17 It is frustrating. We handcuff our energy sector while importing oil & global demand increases. Our government says we will “build the pipeline” while simultaneously funding protesters of that same project. The @liberal_party & @NDP our destroying one of Canada’s economic engines
9490 2018-05-05 16:33:15 i use tea tree oil, witch hazel, & aloe vera the actual plant
9491 2018-05-05 16:33:14 There must be something we can do to  assist one of our own territories.
Obviously we stand by because we have no intersts-- like OIL.
If they had OIL. we"d be on top of it; or if they were not people of color...
9492 2018-05-05 16:33:11 UK & Norway's North Sea reserves low means more reliance on OPEC. Is this main reason why UK Govt. has prostituted itself to will of #SaudiArabia i.e. to ensure adequate supplies of CHEAP Oil & Gas in future. Has UK become compromised and is too prideful to ask #Russia for help?
9493 2018-05-05 16:33:06 No conversation, no forum, no quarter. Natural rights are as breathing. We don't negotiate our right to breathe.
9494 2018-05-05 16:33:02 2/ Best analogy is to commodities I think.  It was absurd for investors to have passive commodity exposure 20 years ago.  In mid-2000s the narrative flipped and things like USO and UNG (ETF passive exposure to crude oil and natural gas) became huge.
9495 2018-05-05 16:32:47 It's been 1,000 days since the BP oil spill and the Gulf of Mexico still has not been restored.

9497 2018-05-05 16:32:42 If it isn't varnished, lacquered or painted, an oiling will probably help prevent the wood from splitting, cracking and splintering for a bit longer! Also useful on garden tool handles, though I believe linseed oil is favoured for that.
9498 2018-05-05 16:32:39 Future based on natural resources alone is not sustainable. In future it may be economic to rave the crude oil in the ground!
9499 2018-05-05 16:32:07 Cook with extra virgin olive oil, the healthiest fat on the planet! High in heart-healthy monounsaturated fats and antioxidants which can help fight painful inflammation! #HealthTips
9500 2018-05-05 16:31:55 I believe they're still importing some refined products from generous souls who'll give Venz credit. Refining, kit is falling apart with lack of investment. Aren't they still massively subsidizing gasoline? So agree crude production off more than oil demand.
9501 2018-05-05 16:31:51 I wanted to lay out today with some tanning oil but it’s not going to be nice and sunny  so looks like the tanning bed it is 
9502 2018-05-05 16:31:43 Diana, I can’t afford a medical card (300 1st visit, 100 every visit after plus price of marijuana). So my Dr. just recommended I try 100% CBD oil. Make sure not just hemp oil. About 80 bucks a bottle. I’m gonna try it because I’m on morphine, Percocet & more and have no relief.
9503 2018-05-05 16:31:34 Tmhe bhi oil ata hai?
9504 2018-05-05 16:31:34 this is gonna sound nasty and ur piercer may tell u not to do it but I stuck a needle in mine and drained it and it dried up better when I used tea tree oil lmao
9505 2018-05-05 16:31:29 Getting my oil changed. Is this the gimmick my life is taking now, whenever I go to visit someone for a weekend I have to have some sort of automotive maintenance done?
9506 2018-05-05 16:31:21 All my people are working today and I need a ride along for dog park, oil change and nails 
9507 2018-05-05 16:31:21 @joliekerr will they ever come up with a product that will get old oil stains out of tee shirts?

9515 2018-05-05 16:30:35 The scourge ($) of mankind is Quantitative Easement. Diluting the dollars value to 4% of its face value by overprinting, making an invisible tax with no backing except the threat of war from the US/NATO forces if they refuse to use dollars for oil. USD’s dead. Metals + Crypto FTW
9516 2018-05-05 16:30:25 Forgot to mention the oil pipeline spills etc.

9521 2018-05-05 16:29:54 If they release a fast and furious 8 this year I will fall into a great depression because so far @Miss__Lyne has gone to see avengers without me and I'm already mixing palm oil with chicken blood.
9522 2018-05-05 16:29:39 I can change my tire & my oil .... & that’s about it 
9523 2018-05-05 16:29:34 No, it doesn’t. Chemically, there’s no such thing as Vicodin, just as chemically, there’s no such thing as water and oil - what you have is phases of one substance suspended in the other. It is marginally possible, looking at the ingredients, to be allergic to an excipient.
9524 2018-05-05 16:29:20 Got to Walmart at 9:25 for an oil change..... and it’s 11:30 almost and still haven’t got my car yet smh 
9525 2018-05-05 16:29:14 Best of luck to you.  My dog had terrible ear problems until I started giving him corn free food and coconut oil.  Dogs love coconut oil usually and it helps fight infections
9526 2018-05-05 16:29:10 #Healthtip #foodtip
Saw some jars at store claiming liquid form coconut oil. That isn't coconut oil Maybe it started out as but it's been frankensteined. #Coconutoil is solid at 76 deg> if going liquid at room temp the #fattyacids have been adulterated

9527 2018-05-05 16:28:37 I'd still go with Clint Hurdle ....  the player
9528 2018-05-05 16:28:37 Finally running errands. Oil change up first.
9529 2018-05-05 16:28:33 Looks like you struck oil 
9530 2018-05-05 16:28:29 Um, it's not "liquid gold" right?  #Bitumen is basically tar -- that's why Alberta imports so much BC #naturalgas to melt it into a liquid insitu.  And as far as oil goes, it's the absolute bottom of the barrel.

9537 2018-05-05 16:27:49 Hi there. All palm oil used in our own-label food products has come from sustainable RSPO-certified sources since 2015. This position is being extended to non-food products by the end of 2018. Thanks
9538 2018-05-05 16:27:44 I’m not embarrassed to admit I just shed a happy tear when I smelled my Banana Boat tanning oil for the first time in what feels like forever 
9539 2018-05-05 16:27:42 The image simply a reminder of an oft-misunderstood point that passenger cars are only 1/4 of oil demand, and even w rapid growth rates of EVs, oil demand can still grow.

9543 2018-05-05 16:27:13 Man that’s shitty  I needed control arms, tire rods, wheel bearings, ignition coils, spark plugs, valve cover gaskets & I got a new windshield & an oil change. $2,500 I was sick  that’s what we get for choosing the German life

9577 2018-05-05 16:23:18 Since oil price plummet in 2014, no additional oil has been pumped by Iran. This is when US-Iran nuclear deal happened. What impact its going to have on oil price when deal is about to collapse? Nothing. Oil price is altogether a different ball game .

9611 2018-05-05 16:19:22 Yeah and olive oil is definitely the same thing as what the bird secretes in the perfect amount. And vegetable oil (and olive oil) have the same effect as crude oil on a birds feathers which you can test at home w a feather.
9612 2018-05-05 16:19:18 I will assume that she used vegetable, and not motor oil...If yes, hilarious...if no____________________________ (Insert what you think I might have said.)

9615 2018-05-05 16:18:56 I need a bird feeder and some oil. That shit made my day
9616 2018-05-05 16:18:56 "Hey now, why should I not take care of a girl that needed it. I just got back into town after a long time so I don't think anyone missed me."

Adding some oil into the pan as he waited for it to heat up, he turned his body to look at Fate.

9618 2018-05-05 16:18:50 Guessing it's a relief for @naomie_olindo not to deal with ADHD Craig.  I am guessing she's relaxed and sweet with the new guy.  Craig will find a woman who adores him, and he's likely to be quite successful.  But he and Naomi were oil and fireworks.
9619 2018-05-05 16:18:28 This coconut oil amazing

9621 2018-05-05 16:18:23 थोड़ी अजीब सी थी वो लड़की। मुर्ग बिरयानी और आलू के परांठे Olive oil  में बनाती थी और श्याम को योगा Frank Sinatra के गानो पर करती थी।

9622 2018-05-05 16:18:23 Equally good! Where your toms come from, they sell a Parmesan made from grass-fed cows' milk in their No 1 range. I myself think that risotto is creamy enough just using extra virgin olive oil. Buon appetito!
9623 2018-05-05 16:18:11 Now trees I can get on board with , no oil in sight 
9624 2018-05-05 16:18:10 Oil product.. the streets are paved with it...  the ocean is fill with it... everything is made of it.
9625 2018-05-05 16:18:07 Oil 
9626 2018-05-05 16:18:07 Yes na. Shevron Palm oil and Gas
9627 2018-05-05 16:18:04 Yes, such a hard place... it was all hard work... sitting on a sea of oil and not requiring proper environmental protections had nothing to do with it.

9640 2018-05-05 16:16:31 Just wait what happens when the oil price goes up again.
9641 2018-05-05 16:16:29 Americans will either have ambition or no ambition. It isn't the drugs. Also hemp oil should not be around for everyone, but only around for actual patients. Anything recreational is pure garbage. It's been shown time after time..
9642 2018-05-05 16:16:27 cleaned my apartment top to bottom while lukas took a nap and I feel sooo relaxed just chilling in a clean ass space with my candles burning and my oil diffuser going 
9643 2018-05-05 16:16:15 Came in for an oil change, gotta get another airbag recall done. I'ma be pissed if I miss my kid's competition.

9645 2018-05-05 16:16:02 Consuming less oil wouldn’t be a big thing ? Talking on the scale of countries like China, the US and Japan ?
9646 2018-05-05 16:15:44 An oil burn is not what I wanted today
9647 2018-05-05 16:15:40 Raw Coconut oil is good. Castor oil from Cantu also.
9648 2018-05-05 16:15:24 Check him out! He's the proverbial snake oil salesman!
9649 2018-05-05 16:15:17 They have a kinda oily skin noh the poison dissolves in that oil and enters their body. And basically switches of their nervous system. Next time you spray at one look at their limbs one by one legs will stop working and it completely stops moving
9650 2018-05-05 16:15:11 If I was given the opportunity to host a table at 'Dîner en blanc' the choices would be one pot, oil down & curried wild meat with the option of paratha or dhalpuree. #supportlocal
9651 2018-05-05 16:15:08 Remember when Obama convinced the Saudi's to pump more oil.  Price of oil plummeted.  Putin got screwed, as their budget was calculated at 100 a barrel..... it went to 40.

9653 2018-05-05 16:15:05 From now on....no one better ask me for a ride! Unless you trying to pay $50 for an oil change, $12 for a deluxe car wash, $30 for a full tank of gas, $100 for a new tire or $130 for insurance so I can keep riding you and whoever else around safe and legally!

9664 2018-05-05 16:13:59 Honestly I dunno! Doesn't really matter if u don't! Just top your oil up and find another cap 
9665 2018-05-05 16:13:57 Because Hillary terrifies Putin?  Renewable energy projects, competence, etc.... Putin's economy is only based on oil.  And their cash reserve fund is gone.
9666 2018-05-05 16:13:54 A committee investigating a collision between an Iranian tanker  and a Chinese freighter has come to diverging conclusions over the  causes of the worst oil ship disaster in decades, Iran's state  television reported on Saturday.
9667 2018-05-05 16:13:51 You need oil

9671 2018-05-05 16:13:42 Rice bran oil, Julia. It does leave a film on the face that needs to be washed off with a gentle cleanser.
9672 2018-05-05 16:13:40 Weird that the picture is from Oahu and not from her magical vagina island in Finland.
9673 2018-05-05 16:13:28 No to off shore drilling. No to inland drilling, no to 100% buying oil in middle east. — yes to horse carriage? To oil use there Mr Coumo!

9675 2018-05-05 16:13:25 Yeah it’s not very clear what you’re trying to state. Transport will be by far the largest sector that impacts oil demand and EVs are the largest section of that tech shift. I’m a hydrocarbons guy but even I’m willing to admit that. Lol

9702 2018-05-05 16:10:14 For telling the truth? I trust an Eagle Scout & honored FBI agent over a snake oil, wife cheating, bankrupt- financial & moral, money laundrying, fraudulent, Russian loving, lying piece of crap human being(which I am use that term lightly).
9703 2018-05-05 16:10:12 This was the basis for the recent OPEC strategy on flooding the oil market to drive recent US entrants into the oil market out of business. Once that new entrant supply is eliminated the oil prices will go again.

9714 2018-05-05 16:09:12 Complicated answer.  Saying "the Canadian Government pays" is false. The gov't pays for land and treaty rights.There is over 3B "in trust" which includes profits from mineral profit, oil, and even payment to First Nations vets (50% of FN payment was held in trust).

9733 2018-05-05 16:06:42 I tell you what it cool round there is that they mothball massive ships and oilrigs sometimes in caharrick roads. Ask a local, they’ll know. A mothballed oil rig is especially surreal when backed by a Cornish hillside.

9748 2018-05-05 16:04:35 Tried all that. I was on hold 57 minutes two days ago and 47 minutes today.  Called 7 times over 30 days trying to trade out this car (oil change over due 8k)  Our RARECAT clients are beloved ... how about your?
9749 2018-05-05 16:04:31 Maybe some oil rich country will buy Stoke and prove conclusively that like citeh, with enough money you can actually polish a turd
9750 2018-05-05 16:04:27 Now they will call you crude oil aka black gold.

9754 2018-05-05 16:03:46 That is obviously high due to the outliers and $1,000,000+ homes.  Alberta is the oil province so lots of money here.  When we rented our apartment it was around $1,100/month.  But you can get cheaper.
9755 2018-05-05 16:03:45 Cinco de Mayo. Well maybe for you. I’m having oil on my hoagie.
9756 2018-05-05 16:03:38 I was waiting for the "crude oil is the same thing as olive oil" argument. Black gold is not a natural fat, Literally everything else is. Quit clutching your pearls

9905 2018-05-05 15:46:14 Hi James. All palm oil used in our own-label food products has come from sustainable RSPO-certified sources since 2015. This position is being extended to non-food products by the end of 2018. Thanks
9906 2018-05-05 15:45:54 Alberta oil isn’t WTI. Its bitumen. It’s trading at $35.
9907 2018-05-05 15:45:52 I made an appointment for an oil change at 8:30 thinking I’d be an early bird with not much people & not much of a wait ..WRONG everyone their mama here along with whoever they partied with last night

9910 2018-05-05 15:45:47 So the currency swap has simply made it easier to exchange Nigerian oil for Chinese ankara, toys, phones, cars etc.
9911 2018-05-05 15:45:23 Then use olive oil! Do she have cradle cap? Olive oil was what l used first to soothe the maturing scalp. An older lady with 7 kids and like 30 grandkids told me that
9912 2018-05-05 15:45:13 They have a steady flow of bank sponsored debt, Saudi oil bribe money and walled off homes. Those that engineered this replacement punched a one way ticket into oblivion and do not care who goes with them.
9913 2018-05-05 15:45:04 YES! Bondi Sands. I used to use the St Tropez brand but it’s so pricey. I switched to Bondi Sands after much convincing haha and I LOVE it. Like half the price of ST and just as good if not better. Currently obsessed with their dry oil 
9914 2018-05-05 15:44:58 my mom took my car for an oil change & she washed it 
9915 2018-05-05 15:44:43 Your right, people should not be made to suffer. They also shouldn't be given medical heroin when they can use CBD oil, or alternative therapies to heal the injury.

Paper so That's why I used that

9922 2018-05-05 15:43:54 If you extract oil, your price is globally determined. At other extreme, if you're a monopoly (like Google) you can charge what you like. Most businesses are in between. Would guess more are closer to oil than to Google. Raising price = reduced sales & less need for labor.
9923 2018-05-05 15:43:43 It’s almost as if Big Oil realizes that: 1) clean  renewable energy is the future; and 2) they lose a fact-based debate or on a level playing field where we stop subsidizing dirty polluting energy. 

So they cheat and lie, and pay actors to lie.

Sunshine, the best disinfectant.

9926 2018-05-05 15:43:31 Not just Big Oil. Investment capital's running away, You can't do business in a country where the leaders take orders from Leadnow, George Soros, the US Tides Foundation & Unions. Biz knows the Alt-Left will inject huge $s into our elections to pursue their socialist goals.

9927 2018-05-05 15:43:30 That's the trajectory for oil. The commodity is cyclic and every 2-3 years comes a downturn. These last douwnturn though, has been challenging and somewhat unusual due to a number of factors.
9928 2018-05-05 15:43:30 Me too Kim He is a Scamme he I think could be Nigerian scammer what happened he used Doug Blevins pictures off Facebook saying that was him also that he was a oil rigger engineer and after said he needed help for repairs ALL LIES &FRAUD

9931 2018-05-05 15:42:55 You’re suggesting that when the price of oil and the Canadian dollar are directly linked? As oil rises so does the dollar? The price of oil is $70 shouldn’t our dollar be higher if that were true

9998 2018-05-05 15:36:11 Agreed, funny the amount of real time capital looked exactly like that BTC going for 30% premium during 20k run. Who has his kind of capital to bloat markets?

10018 2018-05-05 15:33:48 The taste is not the issue first. She needs to go to the hospital and check for any vaginal infection.
But pineapples, watermelons, plantains (for the iron content), lots of water, carrots, fish (rich in Omega-3), bananas, oranges and using coconut oil could help.
10019 2018-05-05 15:33:41 I’ve heard “Higher and Higher” *and* “Jump in the Line” while getting my oil changed so they must have the Soundtracks of the Best Movies of the Late ‘80s Channel on.
