0 2018-12-11 23:59:55 I think its ok for a retail investor with a sum of like $50 a month or something. Anything else should be a positional buy (keep saving fiat and then wait for what you believe to be a good entry, of course few can call the bottom but in the same area code is good enough)
1 2018-12-11 23:59:45 The implications of reducing the money supply are that interest rates will rise, correct? Higher interest rates mean growth will be slower, likely resulting in markdown as investors move to safer assets. Am I right? I'd just like to make sure I interpret it correctly.

3 2018-12-11 23:59:28 Today I received my 1st paycheck to myself in 1.5 years (I worked PT so not to take from crypto) - I'm drinking a cold VT Rock Art DIPA - I'm tasting the work that went into making this $ - the stress/learnings that it took - just like how the brewers learned that made it for me.
4 2018-12-11 23:59:16 You are a braver soul than I! I'm too nervous to even buy $50 worth of crypto. Do you use a certain app or wallet?

10 2018-12-11 23:57:54 My take -  is Any Domicile Australians - won't be able to do code review or code commits to a global project code base

"Strong Encryption" embedded in global projects - Will have to handle Australian code base with separate source code branches & entirely weakened crypto libs

12 2018-12-11 23:57:41 I’m In as well where’s your # at? I just want to place my short above yours lol
13 2018-12-11 23:57:36 It’s possible but having followed market sentiment closely I think a bump is more likely. Not sure how big or if it will last though.

15 2018-12-11 23:57:30 新年から個人ブログを立ち上げようと思い、現在Word Pressについてひたすら勉強してます

が、難しいですね

自由度が高いのは嬉しいけど、出来ることが多過ぎて混乱します

その点ALISはサクッと記事を書けるので楽な印象です

17 2018-12-11 23:57:16 Actually it's kind of holding, while others continue to fall. I'm actually pleasantly surprised that it's holding where it is.
