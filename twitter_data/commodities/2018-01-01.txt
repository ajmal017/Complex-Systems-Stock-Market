49 2018-01-01 19:28:17 Honestly, the dollar is down against the euro; all the commodities are up, it's not a gold thing ...
50 2018-01-01 19:18:04 It's 5% not bloody 500. If you can afford to pay 100 for a meal you can afford to pay the government 5 for all the commodities it has provided. Stop complaining.

53 2018-01-01 18:26:00 And don’t even get me started about these names of bowls now. All bowls should be named for regional commodities such as sugar and oranges and such or grandiose ideas like Liberty or regional tie-Ins like Bluebonnets
54 2018-01-01 18:20:26 Happy New Year Auburn - QE is not money printing, but this is where perception becomes reality.  Most market participants probably interpret QE as money printing.  That's why they sell inflation sensitive assets like long duration Treasuries, and buy equities, & commodities.
55 2018-01-01 18:14:06 Reverting to 1 October prices is suicidal remember such a move was done in 2007 and shops went empty thereafter only tissues were left-local industry died, prior we never used to import basic commodities from SA

75 2018-01-01 15:50:26 O Brasil cresceu graças à (1) bonança internacional, que é cíclica; (2) ás compras de commodities pela China, (3) mas gastou mais do que devia sem poupar e expandindo o crédito irresponsavelmente, assim como (4) os gastos públicos. Por isso que estivemos em recessão.
76 2018-01-01 15:47:39 Completely agree with @Bamabroker that 2018 will be the year that inflation spooks the CBs and forces their hand. Will be the main theme of 2018, with USD falling come year end and Gold among other commodities rallying hard.

84 2018-01-01 14:54:12 That's true. It is 1000x because it's all unnecessary and it's miniscule pointless busy work that has nothing to do with the production of commodities
85 2018-01-01 14:32:25 For some reason I can stand ferrying passengers a lot more than commodities, although it's virtually the same thing. Maybe I just have an aversion to the T-line of ships.

89 2018-01-01 14:21:47 The commodities with the lowest prices always have the most buyers. You don't even have to have good looks, a great body and an even better personality, you just have to be easy.
90 2018-01-01 14:04:59 BTC commodities is the power of believing but fuel is a lot of grey/dark money that injected inside. Truth  is that someone can use human nature weakness to false all decentralized society idea using force of BIG money. That is why price gaining in crypto is dangerous 4 use.

96 2018-01-01 13:04:36 I think that on some level we all have to accept that while under this system aren't really going to be clear or ethical ways to go about any kind of consumption. Even for black people consuming these commodities and the consumer culture around them we have to question ourselves.

98 2018-01-01 12:58:37 -what is and isn't an appropriate way to interact with these commodities. Also because of the knowledge that these commodities a produced through an exploitative racist capitalist system that puts doubt on whether or not there is an ethical way to interact with these commodities.

127 2018-01-01 09:08:57 This will be excellent when we have hedge clippings. Unfortunately we’re in a new subdivision, so apart from one unimaginative box hedge down the street, such commodities are, as it were, then on the ground!

130 2018-01-01 09:02:23 'Market forces' that see people & children as commodities not individuals of worth & dignity. We see the outcome of that cynicism in later years.  As you say, the impact is there to be seen in fostering & the residential sector. God help us all, particularly the young!

133 2018-01-01 08:52:49 January 1, 2018 marks the start of the new Tax Law. With this new Tax cut, people will be bringing more money but it will increase taxes on other commodities such as oil and beverages. We definitely expect and increase in the prices of basic goods and transportation.

140 2018-01-01 08:18:19 The fact that sanctions on a country can increase the cost of certain commodities is not a fact to you is not my concern either.
141 2018-01-01 08:11:28 Only you mentioned egg prices. Daily commodities do not consist solely of eggs. A quick glance on your Twitter timeline it's become apparent to me that your views on Muslims/Islam is distorted and you will not be able to engage in a neutral conversation.Glad I assume you. Goodbye
142 2018-01-01 08:05:39 Looking at cost structures assumes a commodities market where price is the sole differentiator. But consumers can be sticky on prod diff!
143 2018-01-01 07:53:37 I remember. I was trading commodities a bit then. Thought there might be a panic so I shorted the S&P $37,000. Panic and price drop didn’t happen and I lost my money. Pretty much finished my trading days... lol.
144 2018-01-01 07:28:46 The point you're trying to raise raise is addressed in the previous tweet. i.e US sanctions backed by Israel causing the economic problems that Iran is currently facing. Cost of daily used commodities going up etc is after all one of the purposes of a sanction.
145 2018-01-01 07:20:41 That's why prices of daily used commodities surged. Israel did this, right? Iran is not that weak.

Opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth. Everyone has a flock of opinions ready to be wished upon anyone who will accept them. If you are influenced by opinions when you reach DECISIONS, you will not succeed in any undertaking.

152 2018-01-01 05:53:13 If the Keynesian theories are correct... there should be an eventual depression of the dollar value.  When the first collapse in the US dollar happens, that's the sign to get your money out of stocks and into commodities.

157 2018-01-01 04:23:36 Excise Tax will take effect tbis Jan 2018. What away to go for this Administration. As they boast of Tax Deduction from wage earner they took it back by adding excise tax on power and energy. On basic commodities like sugar etc The effect will be for all the socio-economic strata
158 2018-01-01 03:48:30 I'm convinced that in the Star Wars universe there are factories that churn out key tech commodities, like components for droids, weapons, and starships, the fundamentals of which nobody understands anymore.

162 2018-01-01 03:10:09 I think amazon is good to organize, it's a place where tons of commodities move through. But also the trucks, trains, ships and ports that circulate both these and other commodities. I think transport/circulation is a key place along the "supply chain", even more so than amazon

164 2018-01-01 02:31:14 Your sarcasm regarding this very serious issue is neither funny nor conducive in helping expose it. Wake up. These “people” have been using children as commodities for ages. MSM and entertainment media have aided and abetted for just as long.

165 2018-01-01 02:28:24 Many countries can't produce the food, electricity or other commodities they need. Others can supply them. This is one reason why Australia has a great opportunity in supplying food, tourism and clean renewable energy to those places where those resources are short at home.

167 2018-01-01 02:11:24 Also the whole country benefited tremendously from the slave-produced commodities of the South. It was where capital was being invested (land and slaves versus industry and infrastructure) that made the difference. Not some fairy tale about moral courage.
