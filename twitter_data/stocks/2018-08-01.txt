41 2018-08-01 23:34:08 You know the market is a joke and just legalized gambling when @Tesla stocks jump up after a record quarterly loss. It is all speculation and gambling on what @elonmusk just says. He's been profitable 2x since IPO...
42 2018-08-01 23:34:05 This might be the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Dividend stocks usually don't grow at a high rate since their low risk investments. You might want to learn how the financial industry works before you make broad sweeping statements.
43 2018-08-01 23:33:29 It’s mind boggling seeing how some people, even journalists believe a substantial chunk of the stocks can be instantly traded for cash at current market price.
44 2018-08-01 23:33:19 Stocks are not decentralized protocols that require multi-disciplined, technical individuals to sustain, improve and analyze them.

Stocks closed higher Wednesday, with the Nasdaq composite and small caps reaffirming their leadership with record  highs. X. The Nasdaq added 0.7%, climbing to a new high after two days

No, wealth is invested in capital, not stocks & bonds. Even those stocks & bonds are attached to products & equipment.

54 2018-08-01 23:26:10 It was a forgone conclusion that companies would use that tax break to buy back stocks  but not increase wages. Typical of the GOP economics.

56 2018-08-01 23:24:48 Thankyou for this thread Howard. It's reassuring to know I'm not going crazy in starting to build up stocks of nonperishables.
57 2018-08-01 23:24:04 Yeah, that’s in the US stock market. Do you think that’s 100% pharma stocks? Honestly?
58 2018-08-01 23:23:23 Sure, if you can't handle the pain you probably shouldn't pick individual stocks.

61 2018-08-01 23:20:54 Thanks, man! Been talking about the $AAPL ecosystem since about 2011, but many thought I was crazy. Wish I actually bought the stocks back then (instead of those options that went to zero)... Oh, well.. still learning all the time (and at least made back all the money I lost).

66 2018-08-01 23:19:40 Just today several stocks made intra-day moves of more than 12% and not penny stocks or unknown biotechs.  The Container Store (TCS) made a 26% move from open to high. #investing #RetirementPlanning #personalfinance
67 2018-08-01 23:19:15 Don't play the penny stocks.
68 2018-08-01 23:18:40 This shows your have a profound misunderstanding of capitalism. 

1. Hording exists in all economies
2. Don't get your info on capitalism from Scrooge McDuck cartoons. Wealth isn't stored in giant gold vaults. It's invested in stocks and bonds

I usually tend to stay away from the high limelight stocks but this one has been the exception so far as I got attracted to their growing eco system. Capturing and redefining the payment processing vacuum ignored by big players so far.

83 2018-08-01 23:09:41 So if addiction isn't a choice, then we need to hunt down and imprison everyone who held down innocent people and forced them to swallow pills or injected them with illegal drugs.
84 2018-08-01 23:08:49 Lol, only people short sub penny stocks are MM's. I'm long from .0051. I just think a little panic dip before a rip back g/r with a close near HOD. Just based on what I saw throughout the day. But bullish here for sure.
85 2018-08-01 23:08:36 Then prison it is. Abortion is a "I don't want to be responsible for my mistakes" card. Nothing more, nothing less.
86 2018-08-01 23:07:30 $TSLA misses earnings but somehow the stocks goes up by a lot but Microsoft beats and it barely goes up. Yeah that makes sense.
87 2018-08-01 23:06:38 Donald Trump is one of the greatest presidents that the U.S. has had in a while. He has done better then any president w hav had in the past century. Stocks at all time highs. Lower unemployed rates, and his Q2 economic growth is at 4.1% God bless America. Trump is what we needed
88 2018-08-01 23:06:32 little freak knocks it down.

Staying in his room, prepared, would be safer. But again, that makes him look like a coward.

89 2018-08-01 23:06:31 @itsstephtoms @sophdoesnails there is a shop in @westfieldlondon shepherd bush called beauty base it stocks LA girl and Milani products.
90 2018-08-01 23:06:30 Okay, 30% of total income owned by the riches sloshes around the financial markets perpetuataly. When interest rates are low this money flows to stocks. Stock market rises bcz the slosh bids up stock prices
91 2018-08-01 23:04:40 That phrase doesn’t apply to penny stocks. Why? Because if you wait TOO LONG, and the company folds, you lose EVERYTHING. It happens, trust me
92 2018-08-01 23:03:59 Wow, Irene! Incredible !  You are one of @MarketScholars's best students.  I guess It will not go wrong to follow @BrandonVanZee... buy and hold for those Aristocrats kind of good company stocks at right time!  Good Job!

95 2018-08-01 23:01:49 If you stand for the second amendment Mr. President then you really need to back off any and all gun control measures. This includes printed and bump stocks.
96 2018-08-01 23:00:05 Some of us just needed to bang our heads against a wall with Sykes, Dekmar, Warrior... to understand what you just wrote.

Some survive and keep trading with real stocks... Some disappear into the Twitter abyss.
97 2018-08-01 22:59:31 What about printing your own bump stocks? Or other parts that would be used to turn a legal weapon into an automatic killing machine. Those cute little plastic guns aren't the only weapon schematics suddenly ok'd to be downloadable are they? There's some real shit hiding in this.
98 2018-08-01 22:59:27 From growth to a self sufficient business... is that what the Tesla longs want to hear? Can think of other stocks I want to own then.

103 2018-08-01 22:56:20 Yet the CFP has seen a huge decline of our fish stocks and wasteful discarding of fish.
104 2018-08-01 22:55:16 the valuation of Tesla is inexplicable. it's an excellent, innovative company but it's also a ridiculous example of an absurd overvaluation of stocks of anything based on the West Coast of the US
105 2018-08-01 22:54:52 Everyone’s stock in a given company has the same chance of doubling as anyone’s else’s, no matter how many stocks are owned or no matter how rich someone is. Beauty of capitalism and the free market.

110 2018-08-01 22:53:57 True- but lots of jobs high and low paying. Many people I know were very excited about working in the Amazon warehouses. Bezos and Gates and most billionaires wealth can fluctuate by billions in a month depending on the stocks so all are in the same boat.
111 2018-08-01 22:53:56 Is @JimCramer @MadMoneyOnCNBC a pump and dump scheme for hedge funds?
He condemns good stocks for hot ones
1. Vodafone dividend is high cause its a telecom, silly, not cause its suspicious.
2. Netflix is a buy cause he says stay at home workers will be watching movies. Kid u not.
112 2018-08-01 22:52:52 Yep they become a playground - particularly in what I will gently call "cult stocks" its thin - the algos front run them and then we overshoot etc

121 2018-08-01 22:44:50 Depends on where you're getting money from. Pulling $ out of a money market doesn't add to AGI. Selling appreciated stocks/funds/ETFs in taxable generates some cap gains (= income) but it's not fully income (return of capital doesn't = income).

126 2018-08-01 22:40:43 Let me rephrase. Many things effect the stock mkt, which are independent of Trump. There is a positive correlation to the stock market doing well when interest rates are low bcz other assets like bonds or emerging mkts stocks have poorer near term risk/return trade offs.
127 2018-08-01 22:40:25 Rockin’ the stocks

133 2018-08-01 22:38:37 WTH, did market movers hear the words ramp and production then decide to stop and reverse. That's why I don't trade individual stocks. And the SPY just keeps going up sans recent weakness; The dip will be bought imo… only accidently will some catch a crash - when least expected.
134 2018-08-01 22:36:15 Ben faut arrêter de croire que ts les joueurs se doivent d’être stocks. Pas sur qu’il gagne bcp plus dans ce domaine, plus un profil à la Neymar dans ce secteur la.
135 2018-08-01 22:35:38 I am Canadian it does not cost 50% of our income for healthcare. Also we pay less per person and never have to fear some INSURANCE company having power over us. Why do you trust a guy with stocks to decide if you live or die over a guy that needs your vote?

137 2018-08-01 22:34:14 Tough call. 

Banks feel oversold and good value for the long game.
Commodities have been hammered and are ripe for a bounce.
Gold in particular is on a long term low trend line.
Tech stocks look to be picking up steam again after a bad start to 2018.

That's just my opinion.
138 2018-08-01 22:33:15 @Apple REPORTED THEIR Q3 EARNINGS AND NOW THEIR STOCK IS UP 11 POINTS

140 2018-08-01 22:32:49 oh they said yesterday, 6.6 million shares.  Thats very bad.  There was 82 million shares in may and 250:1 reverse split.  thats a lot of dilution
141 2018-08-01 22:32:34 Someone bought 170k $FNO on Stocks - very interesting, because we will swap algo to phi1612 and master nodes...to the moon!

144 2018-08-01 22:31:04 I continue to invest, BUT, unlike most other stocks and shares investments I just don’t understand the volatility and fluctuations in $TSLA shares. I am however very long on @Tesla ...?!

148 2018-08-01 22:29:43 I just love talking to y’all about stocks some people love comics or sports, or music. I just genuinely love business. It’s great. It’s not even a money thing. I just love it. It’s endless. It’s not just a job. It’s so great. Everything is business.

154 2018-08-01 22:28:30 @cvpayne I hate to bother you. Your show is great. I must admit that I don't know much about stocks. 
Just wondering should I start with Penny stocks, or save more and buy regular stocks. Could you point me to a good beginners book? Thanks sir
155 2018-08-01 22:27:42 It’s hard to learn because all of the big investors are selling programs that cost an arm and leg. YouTube is your greatest asset! Watch videos on fundamentals of trading stocks before you get into any of that. And btw don’t throw all your cash in one stock and hope for the best.
156 2018-08-01 22:27:11 yeah but how many shares have they already issued to try to stay afloat?
157 2018-08-01 22:26:43 He knows how to run stocks better than I can tie my shoes
158 2018-08-01 22:26:25 How much of this buyback activity is AAPL? And why forego current income, which is what investors of this kind really live on? A simple ETF of Preferred Stocks would have provided stronger cash flow for years from the outset.
159 2018-08-01 22:26:02 remember hearin that big t was huge into stocks/trades or something similar.
160 2018-08-01 22:25:26  I am convinced that the $HMNY BEARS ARE CONFUSED  

Just because the #stock price is cheaper, does not mean people are going to run & avoid this company.

 The chances of a #MoviePass buyout or a hostile takeover increases as the stock price get lower.

165 2018-08-01 22:22:45 Of course I have stocks! I've invested into many farm produce companies! Gotta finance them apples 
166 2018-08-01 22:20:55 Furthermore, US federal policy had been running down reserve stocks of grain and payments to US farmers were lowered, reducing the amount of grain being produced there

The US also ceased subsidising export sales of grain in the same period, from which the UK had been benefitting

172 2018-08-01 22:15:48 It hasn't worked for the last 50 years. Economic growth has only benefited those who own stocks. Wages have stagnated despite fantastic increases in productivity.
173 2018-08-01 22:14:40 All to displace energy efficiency via “stored” hence less efficient energy consumption. Sexy, sleek and wasteful. Keep buying utility stocks, cause that’s whose producing the energy  for these cars.

174 2018-08-01 22:13:34 Stock market is the major gambling casino in the world. Hard to invest when you cant buy a loaf of bread for the family. So that is a totally bunk argument. Top credo of finances don't invest in stocks if you cant afford to lose it. Most Americans cant afford to lose it. A crock.

201 2018-08-01 21:57:25 You actually increased my taxes with your tax bailout (which wasn’t paid for) for your corporate donors.  And since most of those corporations are using their tax savings to buy back stocks, the only take home pays increasing are those of shareholders and CEOs.  #WI06
202 2018-08-01 21:54:44 The risk/reward of stocks is not a simple issue, so please don’t pretend it is. A 500$ stock that I buy 30 of, has very low chance of doubling quickly. His profit can be 10 bill a year, while small stock holders make a few hundred dollars. Yes amazon pays some, not all well.
203 2018-08-01 21:54:33 No sane person is buying RE for investment in a market with rapidly declining equity - you must be desperate hoping that you can convince someone to do it. Stocks are way better option

207 2018-08-01 21:54:17  $HMNY BEARS always try to minimize anything positive and maximize anything POTENTIALLY NEGATIVE.

211 2018-08-01 21:49:34 Cos an average investor shouldn't pick stocks but buy the market index. In the same vein, advising a noob to buy any crypto-asset including Bitcoin is not in his/her best interest; by definition, an average investor cannot withstand a pre-H1 50% drawdown without capitulation.

215 2018-08-01 21:45:34 @RBReich tweet refers to Apple buying back their own stocks, 43 + 20 billion as I understood,...so u may have to subtract that from the total amount!.@farbodsaraf

217 2018-08-01 21:44:11 Trump just poured millions of dollars into the 1% bank accounts.

Just the corporate buy-back of stocks alone accounts for this current trend.
218 2018-08-01 21:44:11 In a bearmarket all stocks go down
219 2018-08-01 21:42:23 Meanwhile public companies enrich 1% by buying back stocks instead of increasing low income employees wages. Secondly, drill down private company income increases and I'll bet it is also the largest shareholder who won.
220 2018-08-01 21:39:50 From now on everyone shall refer to #Birkenstocks as Stocks. That is all.

Google is a [data access] utility company

At least apple has crap to sell.

234 2018-08-01 21:29:18 Really, nobody who cares about a long term investment should celebrate short term stock price movements in either direction. Celebrate great trend in results ... that’s fine. Stocks are volatile.
235 2018-08-01 21:27:46 @larry_kudlow NOT GOOD! U.S. stocks remain mostly lower Wednesday as the Federal Reserve leaves interest rates unchanged. Fresh worries over U.S.-China trade friction also dampen sentiment. PLEASE ADDRESS!

239 2018-08-01 21:22:12 Both. The thing that helps me the most when I'm in a slump is to go back and look at every trade you made and ask yourself WHY you chose to enter the trade. Most of the time you realize your mistakes are obvious and easy to clean up. 
Then regroup and get back to your strategy!

241 2018-08-01 21:20:39 Is that why their stock went up... Weird, I thought selling private data was the only way to move stocks...
242 2018-08-01 21:19:55 And if corporations couldn’t issue bonds at low rates and use to buy back their own stock (which is inflating the market) what do you think happens. If rates go up & they have to refi bonds at higher rates they’ll need to issue stock to service their debt. Hence stocks go down.

252 2018-08-01 21:10:41 @hussmanjp is accurate based on traditional investment/finance theory.  But his critics don’t realize that when $$ is printed out of thin air & borrowed at irresponsibly low interest rates then stocks, homes, cars, etc can appreciate for as long as the $$ printing continues.

255 2018-08-01 21:09:41 Our article outlines the situation. Apple released a regulatory filing half an hour ago with its updated share count. Stocks/Yahoo/Google haven’t yet updated with the new number of shares, so they have incorrect/inflated market cap numbers for now.
256 2018-08-01 21:09:07 Frank, are still bullish on the gambling stocks that you mentioned a few podcasts back? I bought TSG (-7%), IGT (-1%) & SGMS (-9%). they’ve  dropped quite a bit the last few days and now I’m a bit concerned. You think these guys will pay off in the long term / near future?

291 2018-08-01 20:58:03 There was an episode where Alf stayed up all night trading stocks online and quivering from coffee overdose.  A new world was opened for me.
292 2018-08-01 20:57:32 Fair to say Green Bay will be eyeing 31 other linebacker rooms for potential help come roster cuts (and maybe before). Added to their inside LB stocks in the draft, but that position has been a Packers weakness for some time, even without Jake Ryan’s ACL tear.
293 2018-08-01 20:57:17 I'm still amused by the idea he's totally convinced investors who short Tesla stocks are out to get him, and he and his company are the innocent victims of a vast anti-Elon conspiracy.

295 2018-08-01 20:55:27 I could be wrong but thinking $clvs $tsro could rekindle investors confidence (maybe ). If tsro does show sales higher as well. Just looking at so many biotech stocks that are trading from 1b to 3 billion range without any approved meds.
296 2018-08-01 20:54:47 I think it might be worthwhile to think about regulating ammo and gun powder/reloading supplies.
Also, there should be a way to make a homemade gun legal by meeting requirements and getting a serial number for it.
Also, will there be plans for silencers?  bump stocks?

351 2018-08-01 20:22:50 When in reality I think we know its a complex set of issues that only an extreme minority can be totally for or against.  Look at bump stocks, open carry, assault rifles, etc.  There are controversial issues without consensus.  Pro-gun and anti-gun is an oversimplification.

Chris Cox of the NRA just said we don't need to worry about 3D Printed guns because plastic guns are already ILLEGAL.

Do you mean that LAWS actually help prevent gun violence after all?

Let's create LAWS banning Bump Stocks and Assault Rifles then!

363 2018-08-01 20:18:19 World stocks edge lower: Europe -.5%; US -.1%. Trade euphoria lasted exactly one day as trade tensions with China exploded in the news, wiping out any impact of solid earnings. Investors need to consider if trade issues will impact 2018-19 earnings negatively - could happen.
364 2018-08-01 20:17:01 Stocks mostly lower as US-China trade-war threat flares again. Dow -81, -0.3% to 25,333. S&P -0.1%, but techs see modest rebound: Nasdaq +0.5%

372 2018-08-01 20:14:14 I honestly think IDS and their ilk just assume people are making it up. "Come on", they're thinking, "You must have a spare ten grand or some stocks and shares for a rainy day stored away, EVERYONE has that". They're that divorced from reality.
373 2018-08-01 20:13:28 We need to keep the pressure on, our voices must be heard.

377 2018-08-01 20:12:22 I appreciate your words man. It's interesting to watch how you bring many familiar ideas from penny stocks to crypto world - sub satoshi coins are similar to (sub)penny stocks in a certain way. And yes, before the CT, my "second home", for some time, was InvestorsHub 
378 2018-08-01 20:11:45 I hope that Apple’s stocks app automatically shows their market cap as 1.00T when the time comes. 1000B would be a little sloppy.
379 2018-08-01 20:11:14 We are aware the "pullback buys" are more aggressive than longer base breakouts. Each person must determine their risk tolerance and act accordingly.

389 2018-08-01 20:07:06 She can’t...she doesn’t know what stock buyback means and neither do you. Companies buy back their stocks in order to boost share prices which benefit common folk who own shares in that company. 401k values go up, pensions increase...everyone wins. Yeah capitalism!!

393 2018-08-01 20:02:49 You’d think Vegas fell off the map looking at gaming stocks today with heavy exposure.  Heavy selling. $mgm $byd $czr
394 2018-08-01 20:02:30 Yes, different time frames yield different results. But it's worth noting that there ARE other stocks in this market, many of which provide more income, more stability, and much less chance you'll wake up 19% poorer like with $FB!
395 2018-08-01 20:02:19 I'd be 25% nervous. But don't worry I'll order you one with the US orders too. Whichever stocks first
396 2018-08-01 20:02:19 US stocks closed lower on the day: $DJIA -81, $SPX -3
397 2018-08-01 20:02:12 US stocks closed lower on the day: $DJIA -81, $SPX -3
398 2018-08-01 20:01:54 After Las Vegas, we couldn't even get a discussion going on bump stocks, so I have little faith anything will ever be done on guns in America.
399 2018-08-01 20:01:30 Keep in mind we have an orange guy pressing his bets further on these tariffs. So it makes sense portfolio managers will want to diversify into some defensive sectors like staples. Set your opinions and biases aside and let the stocks lead the way.

429 2018-08-01 19:46:53 True! However, the consumption of chicken has decreased because Americans are consuming more beef and pork, whose prices have decreased. Apparently, stocks of frozen chicken are increasing. The tariffs are having all these indirect effects on supply and demand.

566 2018-08-01 18:24:23 there's only about 5 trillion physical dollars in circulation, the rest are stocks, savings, and other financial assests that are essentially IOU's
567 2018-08-01 18:24:03 Absolutely wrong. The massive increase in new investors in the 1920s and overvalued stocks was the critical cause of the crash. Once investors reassessed values of publicly traded companies during a end to the boom economy and pulled out it caused a panic run on stock market.
568 2018-08-01 18:23:40 Så har det alltid varit. Nu är det kanske synligare, men på samma sätt har det varit väldigt, väldigt länge. Penny stocks har alltid varit en storfavorit bland dessa

654 2018-08-01 17:42:52 $TSLA reports today and my guess is they report a "strong quarter" but the Q&A exposes some glaring weaknesses. Also, the rotation out of growth stocks is not helping them from a macro perspective. I am buying puts near the close. #investing #volatility

706 2018-08-01 17:14:05 Well, I haven't got big pharma stocks either. I'm only swayed by, uh, scientific evidence? Which you have not got.
707 2018-08-01 17:13:59 This. Exactly this. I remember that the single factory that made the official cards had burned down a week before I got my PS2, and panic buyers emptied out the existing stocks. It was over a month before I could actually save my game.

755 2018-08-01 16:53:14 It's not all that long ago 'wealth managers' (i.e. DFM) would initially quote THEIR AMC as their cost to invest.

785 2018-08-01 16:40:11 Looking into some stocks, does anyone do small trades online and have a referral or recommendation for a site to use?
786 2018-08-01 16:39:22 at this point best to just sit and wait for the FED.

824 2018-08-01 16:26:26 Good for you! I am currently working on a rant about life insurance. It makes me so mad to see people sold unnecessary, expensive policies when they'd be better off investing that money in low cost stocks and bonds.
825 2018-08-01 16:26:06 Agree. I did before and even got put in on expiration date and had to buy 100 stocks. Panicked first, but obviously we can sell that stock too. If I can get AAPL@167.50 now, sure it will go up, then it would be a good deal to have. Do u short LEAPS put too?

900 2018-08-01 16:00:06 So what's the bull thesis to buy $AAPL 1 trillion.  What is the upside?  downside!  Seems like there are no stocks left to buy and thus the case for a 20-30% swift decline.  $AAPL 1 trillion a bad investment imo!  Sorry @tim_cook - tell me why buying your stock is a good idea?
901 2018-08-01 15:59:36 Great to see! Whats your current favourite ASX listed stocks John? - I'd rate BOE as the lowest cost producer, though DYL/AGE for stellar gains. VMY/BMN have quite a high capex/opex due to lower grade material. NXE seems the standout worldwide in the blue chip class.
902 2018-08-01 15:59:27 Laziness and saving money is the reason this continues to happen between both parties, and the reason why less and less ppl are using FB. With FB’s stocks falling over $100 billion in value recently, they’ll have to listen instead of ignoring shit like always.
903 2018-08-01 15:59:27 What regulation cuts stimulated economic growth? There is no evidence of this anywhere. It's just BS that is typical cycle of rinse & repeat over and over.

912 2018-08-01 15:56:53 $EDIT and the rest of the CRISPR stocks still weak on super low volumes. They just keep getting walked down.
913 2018-08-01 15:56:39 Stocks often make their greatest gains in the third or fourth year that you own them. A few took ten years.
914 2018-08-01 15:55:28 Geez! got me. I hold 2. Impressive!

919 2018-08-01 15:52:35 It's really hard to stay focus and avoid trading POS stocks with low volume since there is nothing else out there. Great job posting stuff like this. It's helped me from force trading big time. Gracias parcero!!!

924 2018-08-01 15:50:46 $USDJPY is in so much trouble these next months. The #yen will be back at it again just like earlier this year. Ripping everyone's face off. It's a black hole, nothing can escape its pull. Not #stocks, not #commodities, & not #bitcoin. Black hole = crippling, rapid deflation

927 2018-08-01 15:48:43 Not to mention there is a lot of evidence that shows most of the tax savings went to buy back of stocks.
928 2018-08-01 15:48:22 Another approach would be to tax gains annually (i.e. mark to market). While this seems terribly unfair to those with illiquid assets, what is the argument with respect to  publicly traded stocks?
929 2018-08-01 15:48:02 Mid day selloff of $CRSP $NTLA and $EDIT per usual, low volume good for bears, bulls to win the month after strong $NTLA earnings show positive outlook on future of CRSPR stocks. Good buy price
930 2018-08-01 15:47:57 I am already in the red. As long as the previous low can hold, we will be in the money. If not, I will have to run for life. Every time I get nervous when I touch high flyer stocks.

1001 2018-08-01 15:20:28 3. Diversify in an effective way.
Remember that it is not advisable to put all your money in one place, you are developing a diversified portfolio, you can look at altcoins, more tradition assets like stocks and bonds.

1032 2018-08-01 15:07:38 There’s no need to show you financial statements that you know I can’t access. The link about MormonLeaks’ “scoop” said they used SEC filings to discover the stocks. The SEC is a government agency. If those Church corporations weren’t paying taxes, the government would know.
1033 2018-08-01 15:06:41 Think about it.

If you took DD & AC off of the sky & replaced them with EP & TC, couldn't their W/L record be reversed?  Instead of 10-17, they could be 17-10.  

The ? becomes, "Can Amber Stocks & the Sky make that trade?"

It might take more than that, like #1 draft picks.
1034 2018-08-01 15:06:22 I understand. I’m just saying that my risk control moves me in and out in stages, not all at once.  I had tons of cash at market bottoms because my process had me selling when stocks hit my targets or when they did not do what I expected.
1035 2018-08-01 15:06:01 I still find it dope that you are able to move in and out of those stocks. I know you use market orders but still...those spreads are crazy at times.
1036 2018-08-01 15:04:27 Technically, alpha means ‘better than the market’. What we need is for the companies that constitute the market to be sustainable - that’s a much bigger ‘ask’ though the recent relative demise of fossil fuel stocks is a hopeful sign!

1039 2018-08-01 15:03:14 And cigarette company Altria (NYSE: MO) expects sales growth of less than 1% – yet the stock trades at 5.6X sales.

Cannabis stocks like Aurora are early movers.

They don’t have a lengthy history of growth and big profits. Plus, they don’t pay dividends to their shareholders.
1040 2018-08-01 15:02:23 Why haven't you banned bump stocks and raised the age to purchase a firearm to 21 like you said you were going to do? Are you afraid of the NRA?
1041 2018-08-01 15:02:03 CSFB created a alt-prime-option-reset paper about a year before the bubble burst. I held off buying a house and saved 60 grand by picking up a foreclosure at 60 cents on the dollar. Also made money selling bank stocks. But "no one could have seen it coming" according to the Fed.

1053 2018-08-01 14:55:51 The NRA doesn't have a say in government. Watch the vid though you might be interested more to hear the other side

They arent lying when the ATF is to blame for bump stocks

They come out to defend any sort of gun ban but they still don't have government power to make a change.
1054 2018-08-01 14:55:31 why stocks so heavy today
1055 2018-08-01 14:54:32 if $AAPL closes < 200 its go time for other tech stocks especially $FB
1056 2018-08-01 14:53:32 3d printed firearms are not reliable for much use. 3d parts like grips, stocks, receivers and magazines may be durable. Most normal people wouldn't bother. The developers and hobbyists love this kind of stuff, however.

1058 2018-08-01 14:52:35 I did not know that. I also did know the construction of the firearm. I saw a M-16 being fired on automatic. These plastic barrels look weak. Plastic stocks I believe were first used on the M-16 I believe, If they were all plastic, it looks like it would blow up in your face.
1059 2018-08-01 14:51:50 Trading #Tip:

In stocks of interest,

The Lower the Prices go, the More Eyes & Attention it will get, the Better entries for everyone, the Higher the Percentage gains when it moves, you can only take certain stocks so low before traders pounce.

Let it work in your favor.

1125 2018-08-01 14:32:59 They probably shorted the shares at or around recent highs ie at much higher SPs (possibly as high as 400p vs today's 250p) driving the fall in the SP.

1306 2018-08-01 13:31:49 True sir. Some things never change . One such thing is if one invests in stocks which trade 100 times their earnings,one has to be ready for muted returns.

1328 2018-08-01 13:22:31 Sorry that I kinda sounded harsh and didn't explain myself good. I mean if shareholders continue to buy those companies stocks there is no way to stop execs from robbing what those shareholders invested in.

1377 2018-08-01 12:58:01 I think the mere fact, that there is an acronym for the leading stocks is a warning sign. At least with TMT (2000) and BRICs (2008) it was sector or countrywide exposure. with FAANG you have only 5 shares, which are very concentrated among many investors portfolios...

1426 2018-08-01 12:29:48 Gold thrives in times of trouble.Think 2000s decade (worst for US stocks in 110 years).Or the 1970s, 2008 was a short-term aberration due to a banking liquidity crisis that's not likely to recur.Even then gold's decline was very brief before it began soaring again to record highs
1427 2018-08-01 12:29:10 And they wonder why their stocks have slipped considerably!?!?!?!!
1428 2018-08-01 12:29:07 "Stocks are traded at a value that investor are willing to pay."  All you've described here is present value of a stock.  Clearly, when someone forecasts price, they are forecast a price at which investors are willing to pay for the stock in the future.

1658 2018-08-01 09:35:08 No, they SHOULD be worried about the income and equality in this country. It is unstainable, and every economist knows it. Should 1% of the country worry about 87% of stocks owned? Or should 99% worry about the 13% owned by them? Id say the 99% have more to worry about than 1%.
1659 2018-08-01 09:33:47 Let us leave today's knee jerk.

1945 2018-08-01 05:25:05 The stocks are a direct result of their class action law suit which is currently going on for discriminating only one side of the political spectrum. The stocks plummeted in parallel to the suite

2021 2018-08-01 04:19:50 Jon, let’s carry your thoughts a couple of steps further.

Companies buy stocks to boost prices: so who are selling at these higher prices? Average joes? Then aren’t they making out like bandits?

Execs selling at higher prices: who are buying? Not the people who just sold

2026 2018-08-01 04:16:38 I find it absolutely incredible that this president consulted with the NRA, to assist in his decision. Remember when he said he'd raise the age to 21 to purchase weapons, and ban those freaking bump stocks? No follow through on that either. Never keeps his word.

2030 2018-08-01 04:12:00 ... But a Good Strategy would be to Overweight Growth stocks in the Beginning of a Bull Market... And as we begin to gain Profits on paper, sell some of these holdings, this is what we call "Profit Taking", and Diversify into some Value stocks that you think are Bullish on...
2031 2018-08-01 04:11:27 I know plenty people of middle class people that own stocks and would benefit from this.  So is this a war on the middle class? Are we not worth have tax cuts on money that has been invested and already taxed? This is very misleading! STOP!

2036 2018-08-01 04:08:42 Homie stocks kinda feel like a lose/lose/lose/lose

Don't Give & Win:

Don't Give & Lose:

2146 2018-08-01 02:55:37 He turned those lemons into lemonade. You forget his gigantic achievements even before he became president. I picked bad stocks, but on balance served my customers well. On balance, he is way ahead.

2150 2018-08-01 02:54:38 U.S. Market Check
U.S. stocks advanced as trade optimism lifted industrial shares and tech companies staged a recovery. Oil sank and the dollar gained.
The yield on 10-year Treasuries fell about one basis point to 2.95 percent.
2151 2018-08-01 02:54:21 I'm so excited!
2152 2018-08-01 02:53:49 Perhaps but next season he’s your ace, with Burnes in the rotation as well.

2157 2018-08-01 02:50:37 investing is such a simple task to do if your goal is long term. you just need to pick the right stocks and sit through the ups and downs, avoid shorting and f&o and that's pretty much it. 
simplicity really works here :)

2189 2018-08-01 02:36:01 The graph my broker shared was very interesting. Basically, blue chip stocks outperformed REITs and utilities in the first 30 years.  From 30-40 years, utilities outperformed. After 40 years, REITs outperformed. This assumes dividend reinvestment.
2190 2018-08-01 02:35:42 Ten cent Holdings is the mother of all China stocks...and already pulls down $44 billion a year in revenue from all the businesses they are in. Everything from CC e- mobile payments, to online chatting and video, to video games (they own 40% of Fortnite and  25% of Activision)
2191 2018-08-01 02:35:38 Nonsense. What percent of rich people's assets do you think are in consumer goods such as cars and boats? A rich person buys a 10 mil dollar home from someone who buys an even bigger home. No "trickle down". It's the same with stocks. It gets concentrated to point we're at now.
2192 2018-08-01 02:35:27 How unbelievably awesome would it be if Nelson and Davies came back to team at same time and both pitched like they did in 2017?
2193 2018-08-01 02:34:48 Interesting to see where tech goes from here: Valuation hasnt mattered 4 several years now. Will we get this rotation out of growth & into value. Aka industrials r cheap. Tech is not.

2194 2018-08-01 02:33:42 U & your family are full of crap. Federal Labor Dept. stated the truth, wages are flat for the bottom 90% of workers.

2195 2018-08-01 02:33:21 So much of the discussion seems to be on all-plastic undetectable guns.   Bunk.  The real issue is making the frames, which have the serial number.  Parts like barrels and stocks can be bought without restrictions to make a serious weapon that is untraceable

2226 2018-08-01 02:15:39 last time we checked, 40% EARNINGS growth is good.  Stocks are still about EARNINGS not units still, right?
2227 2018-08-01 02:15:11 Lower income people buy things to live. Milk, bread, school supplies, clothes, diapers,  don’t go up in price because a company sells 15% more.

I'd say around $175,000 if i didn't have to pay taxes, the rest would be divided up into commodities, real estate, perhaps a venture if someone pitches me something good. I'd save a portion for when the stocks crash, pick up some of those cheap.

2262 2018-08-01 01:46:03 It's probably because when you say you only add to winners it kind of implies that my pick isn't a winner. So it invites comments like,

2269 2018-08-01 01:43:06 @apassos with respect, I only trade stocks for 30 cent gains at the minimum. Sure that’d be 100% but I can make much more and safer money
2270 2018-08-01 01:42:21 They get a little. Some do have stocks. Also counts towards appreciation gains on housing when sold.
Change would be to make inflation adjusted.

I want to know what happen to infrastructure. Good paying jobs would come from that. No white shirt is going to swing a hammer.

If there's anything dodgy on any stocks that I'm on then I would like to know about it

2280 2018-08-01 01:33:38 It will come only when least expected. Indian market is artificially at ATH using few index stocks. Euphoria missing in market. Indices at ATH but portfolios not. Retailers and investors having feeling of left out in present move from 10000 to ATH.
2281 2018-08-01 01:33:34 It’s true. Only so much money to squeeze out of consumers to generate revenue and so many advisors to buy stocks... buybacks made it easier to hit “targets”

SEC has very specific jurisdiction: securities, like stocks & bonds.

Not all financial crimes. FBI has a white collar crime division.

They control the DOJ, so they are some what invulnerable

2286 2018-08-01 01:32:43 Investors attitudes toward risk depend on the frequency with which investors monitor their portfolios. Many investors do not heed this good advice and invest too little of their money in stocks.

2289 2018-08-01 01:30:14 I certainly hope that you don't trade stocks and interest rates with that same mindset. 

But then again, today's Wall St is packed with Millennials, who've never lived through a real crash or worked in an interest rate environment not enabled by The Fed.

Seriously.

2302 2018-08-01 01:21:29 “SELL THE NEWS” (the bear ploy)

This is what short-sellers do to create confusion in the market; then they also love to have the chance to publish articles that “legitimize” the foul play that $HMNY bears will surely share & use to continue to drag/drop the price.

2335 2018-08-01 00:51:13 As former biz reporter, amused at MSM biz advice-- when to hop-scotch portfolios to specific companies, move stocks vs. bonds etc. Most folks, if lucky, have at least relatively locked-in pension/ investments with some leeway to adjust. Best advice is to talk to us, not bankers.

2342 2018-08-01 00:46:21 Be sure to mark your calendar for August 11th

Bears will definitely want to drop the price before earnings release; just in case it’s good they will have all ready devalued it. It’s their ploy.. 

Once details are published; it will either kills all the bears or cripple a few!

2358 2018-08-01 00:31:59 Donnie, did you stop by Parkland and tell them why you haven’t banned bump stocks or required that people have to be 21 to buy firearms?  You told them you would do those two things. But that was before you met with the NRA.
