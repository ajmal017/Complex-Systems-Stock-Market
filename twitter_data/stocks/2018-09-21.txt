44 2018-09-22 23:30:02 Better not wait too long. Stocks are dwindling as we speak.
45 2018-09-22 23:29:50 Looking at about 28 or 29 sprint cars. Maybe 10 or 11 Street stocks
46 2018-09-22 23:28:51 Be cautious of Stock chat rooms pumping stocks to influence you to buy in big to only lose it all once they dump... They will do anything to screw you out of your money

Be warned about $SECI

I called ETrade, and they warned me about this low volume stock getting pumped so high
47 2018-09-22 23:28:13 Not quite. 16.8% is more like it. Don't pat yourself on the back so much. Most of your supporters don't own stocks or have 401K's which shows how out of touch with reality you are 25th amendment............
48 2018-09-22 23:26:59 Agreed on 3 stocks for pm and not melee. Best of five I think is fine but lower the timer

55 2018-09-22 23:08:42 I don't record phone calls, sorry....but calling for yourself is a 100% sure way to know what the TRUTH is.
56 2018-09-22 23:07:20 I gave you that so you have the correct court house to call and verify for YOURSELF...why believe anyone else if you have doubts you can simply 
make the call yourself?
57 2018-09-22 23:06:54 Did you call them? Where is the proof... That's all I am asking

59 2018-09-22 23:06:01 Call them!! lol...speak to the court....unless you think they are lying too.
60 2018-09-22 23:04:52 That doesn't prove anything... Where is the verification again?
61 2018-09-22 23:04:02 @Jack you give us back @RealJamesWoods and maybe people will stick around when another platform comes along that doesn't censor people.  And maybe when that happens your stocks won't drop like Bill Clintons pants in trailer park -
62 2018-09-22 23:03:55 Yes it's up because taxes cuts allowed company CEOs to use that money to buy stocks to artificial make prices going up to make it look like stocks are up. We are not fooled

Yes I do.
72 2018-09-22 22:57:53 Do you understand "imputed rent"? If you own a home that you live in, you own a financial asset that's generating a return, and you're consuming some of that return in the form of free rent. If you invest in stocks instead, and pay rent on equivalent home, you come out the same.

76 2018-09-22 22:50:40 We can then invest in asteroid mining stocks. Win win.
77 2018-09-22 22:50:17 He sure does. That's why unemployment is at an all time low. More jobs for the American people. Stocks are up . And i got a nice increase in my pay.. yup sounds like it to me
78 2018-09-22 22:49:56 Are you giving Citron the credit?? Hahahahaha it’s people like you who actually allow their crummy credibility. First they said to short when it was $90? Citron did not call anything in Tilray that 90% of the people who follow Pot Stocks could have told you.

81 2018-09-22 22:46:59 What about the exploding deficit brought on by the tax cut for the rich at the expense of health care and infrastructure?
What if these tariffs cause China to stop financing our deficits by investing in US treasuries?  What about inflation? Are stocks overvalued?
82 2018-09-22 22:45:06 Thats not how stocks work. It would only raise profits of this quarter. Trends is that of every american stock. Ironically trump had a huge part in their small rise
83 2018-09-22 22:44:13 The investment return on real estate, *after* considering imputed rent, *must* be equal to the investment return on stocks. You come out the same if you rent and put the money you would have put into equity into financial investments, or if you put the money into your home.

85 2018-09-22 22:43:18 A couple of days on a rack, stretched nicely. Then a couple of more days in the stocks so I can play with you at my leisure. If your knight doesn't come rescue you by then I guess you'll be mine to keep in the dungeon forever.
86 2018-09-22 22:43:05 You just proved that that's not the expected return. The expected risk-adjusted return on investment real estate and on stocks have to be the same, otherwise the prices would be different. An economic theory based on the premise that the entire market is wrong, is suspect.
87 2018-09-22 22:40:56 Surement une variété qui est différente de la votre vu que les stocks sortent de Porto Rico etc
88 2018-09-22 22:39:22 If I invest 100k in stocks & get a 10%/yr return, I did pretty good. If I buy a 500k house w/ a 4% or even 5% interest rate using the 100k as a down payment & it appreciates at 10%/yr, I will make a lot more $ and have a roof over my head in the meantime.
89 2018-09-22 22:36:36 Why are the stocks up?
90 2018-09-22 22:36:10 have u seen how much they (central banks) are printing and throwing at stocks, shares and company debt, they control the share market.
91 2018-09-22 22:35:37 I do breakout but not like traders think. I do breakout to ATH with specific stocks.
92 2018-09-22 22:34:52 No win for Horoya but glad seeing Godfred Asante at this level. GPL almost rendered players of his calibre “old stocks” & irrelevant to the game. As Ghanaians I think we get fed up with our own too early. #TotalCAFCL

107 2018-09-22 22:15:52 Ray, in regards to uncorrelated investments. How correlated are domestic stocks with international stocks? Would international stocks be considered a different asset class from domestic stocks?
108 2018-09-22 22:15:06 Are you trying to tell me that our actions have no consequence? That land has not been cleared, that the birds and animals are still there, that fish stocks have not plummeted from over fishing, the the dodo is still here, that nothing changes despite the changes? Really?

If @RealJamesWoods or one of our educated and cultivated voices of reason are silenced by whichever social network then millions of us not using it may well bring the concerned stocks down, right?  But we love @Twitter & @jack fairness.
111 2018-09-22 22:14:37 Pay yourself first! 30% of your income goes to you. With your 30% split it into threes. 10% goes to a savings account. 10% goes into an emergency account. The last 10% is your investment account. Buy stocks. Own 100 companies. Rule of 72 is the magic carpet ride.
112 2018-09-22 22:13:41 Except that’s not true. Stocks are up & consequently 401K’s, but wages are FLAT. And the trillion dollar debt caused by the billionaires tax cut is killing us on costs for essentials &healthcare. No  now for education & infrastructure!
113 2018-09-22 22:11:26 We all get it. Wealthy people (aka people with extra money to invest in stocks) are getting wealthier. That's not a "success" for America. That's success for a select group.

127 2018-09-22 21:55:15 And I still have stock in GE.  I've also been noticing that when GE goes lower but another company goes lower and the other company I don't have to worry about capital gains b/c of no profit... I'll just switch it over to GE stocks :).   Ahh investing in the future.

Please try to help more of the MIDDLE CLASS and impoverished ELDERLY & DISABLED ?

Thank you kindly.
134 2018-09-22 21:41:26 China’s stock market selloff in 2018 is serious. The index lost 25% in 2018, large cap stocks in China also lost 25%

138 2018-09-22 21:36:49 Nike stocks have been the highest they’ve been in 53 years. How about that boycott????
139 2018-09-22 21:35:47 Record Profits for Corporations and the working class wages remain the Same. Largest deficit, millions without health care, largest racial division in history, and Farmers loosing billions.  They the whole story.  The average American does care about Stocks. We can’t afford  it
140 2018-09-22 21:33:51 Well, it was a simple final question for the exam; Question was "oral" of course cuz that's how NUTS do it...but The question was "Stocks rise ...High!" and they all raised their arms. They did good. haha
141 2018-09-22 21:33:31 Trading stocks has got me hyped for the week. It’s almost like when Friday rolls around, I’m ready to trade again on Monday
142 2018-09-22 21:32:47 Not create our own network but to buy a controlling stake in one in of the networks. We can crash its stock, 12.5 mill users are enough to create a campaign to crash these colliding networks and we can buy their stocks for peanuts. It has been done before...we can do it

146 2018-09-22 21:29:34 It would be interesting to know how many of these news readers own individual stocks. I bet their money would be in Mutual funds and FDs.
147 2018-09-22 21:29:06 No they can’t calculate how much she has in stocks or anything either. It’s just the net sum of how much she has like cars, houses jewelry stuff like that.
148 2018-09-22 21:28:56 Keeping a Brest of the international stocks?
149 2018-09-22 21:27:31 Judging by how stocks rise and fall at the behest of marketing campaigns, it makes me wonder if the stock market is simply a distraction from the wholesale accumulation of real wealth in the hands of the wealthy few
150 2018-09-22 21:27:23 no greater sadness than tearing a nail 
151 2018-09-22 21:26:47 Ah, sure. In comparison to individual stocks I can see how they obviously decrease risk. Personally as a retail investor I tend to compare them to mutual funds (which is also the comparison I was making when I said I didn't understand why people say ETFs are for the long term)
152 2018-09-22 21:26:00 The weekend is here and its time to catch up on this week's journal entries by adding more detail, screenshots, analysis and more. Next week will be here before we know it!

163 2018-09-22 21:16:59 In comparison to singular stocks. Most ETFs (or rather their underlyers) tend to be built to essentially be broader indexes which has the obvious effects an index would have on potential downside/upside.They don't necessarily have this trait, but this is where I see their utility

270 2018-09-22 19:32:45 Not when prices of gas, food, & now basic consumer products are all going up bcuz of a stupid trade war.
The temporary & meager tax cut we got is all eaten up while Big Business gets a permanent tax cut windfall to buy back stocks & give big exec bonuses.
People should be first!
271 2018-09-22 19:32:17 Remind me to save bad eggs & rotten tomatoes.  Shall trawl local skips for pallets & fashion stocks out of them.
272 2018-09-22 19:32:00 A kinder gentler day at the stocks. Got some more Aurora and Invictus; neither at the greatest prices I wanted but within reason. Besides, I got a feeling they're gonna be on the upswing Monday; so really, who gives a shit? As long as the profit is there.
273 2018-09-22 19:31:12 Yes!! Nike stocks are up!
274 2018-09-22 19:29:13 Really - folks check your 401 yourself. 50% is bulls..t. Lies, lies and more lies. A handful of stocks are driving the market rally, and just because the market is up doesn’t mean your 401k return will match it.
275 2018-09-22 19:28:54 because it’s only a game & i didn’t even know it was going to skyrocket like that lmao maybe investing in stocks is something i should do in the future though honestly  then i can be all of my mutuals’ sugar mommy

277 2018-09-22 19:28:05 Guys please stop asking targets and stop loss of stocks from this noble guy @Deishma as if he is your personal advisor, just because he is responding to everyone. Don't take undue advantage and choose from anyone he already mentioned and trade.
278 2018-09-22 19:24:39 Yes great to meet some of you again. Hope you all have a good trip home. @village_idiot was sat next to you @InvestedGeordie! Hope you are better at finding stocks.

284 2018-09-22 19:19:52 What is your horizon for a double. If you compare to other MJ stocks we could be 4x today. But in Q4 we will know the real margins and sales of the whole sector. MJ is fastest growing sector in the world.

296 2018-09-22 19:05:23 Does technical analysis actually work on small cap stocks? I am asking from a position of absolute ignorance as I don't pretend to understand it. Does it account for sentiment, BOD interviews, placing a at X price etc?

310 2018-09-22 18:51:39 Not sure. US stocks already pulled back in February and it was a good buy by March. S&P 500 Index has 2.5-3% upside to ~3,000 level, or its long term average return of 12%. Probably a pullback in October and sideways till the year end. It looks lower in 2019...

if you have $100 , then buy stock with $60 and keep $40 in savings account.  $40 dollar will give opportunity and $60 will keep on increasing until dooms day?

317 2018-09-22 18:45:12 "I owe her an apology" is a weasel's apology.  I'd prefer it be made in today's public stocks, the twittersphere, with Biden forced to read every response.  It does matter.  It will always matter.
318 2018-09-22 18:44:02 The Manchester United Board has lost course. It's often better to sell your stocks at a loss to avoid a further downside and in turn realise potential recovery in an alternative asset class. ..
319 2018-09-22 18:42:49 Don't know. I've sold products to PR electric utility. Normal utility stocks are something for "widows and orphans," as they say - stable, safe. PR utility was on credit hold, extremely corrupt. So did FEMA fail? Locals? I don't know...both is my guess.

363 2018-09-22 18:12:02 People compare Bitcoin to a Bubble to discredit it. From 1991-2000 Only very few called tech stocks a bubble. Few have an ability to see or comprehend a bubble. One can intuit that because so many call Bitcoin a bubble it is actually not a bubble. The Crowd is often wrong.

377 2018-09-22 17:49:36 Fair enough.  I don't do margin trades in crypto / stocks.  Too much risk for me.
378 2018-09-22 17:49:24 You have enough fuel stocks on social Media and Twitter, but those of us who live in Zimbabwe are in queues or hunting for it !  You shall even put lipstick on a copse  to make it appear alive in your effort to deny truth!  For how long shall you run away from your shadow?
379 2018-09-22 17:49:04 With this in mind, it makes more sense to hold onto $URG until $UUUU and $UEC shareholders are hit with large "unexpected" CAPEX costs. This can create pessimism in the stocks, and potentially allow for a buying opportunity to take advantage of uranium prices > $65.
380 2018-09-22 17:48:43 invest money into me and like 2 friends and we will play with you. Think of it as fun over time investments and the stocks are looking good. Also dont do what i just said. Ive been playing 15 year old korean mmos

389 2018-09-22 17:39:00 That's like saying "no-load funds will cause consumers to invest less in stocks because there's no broker incentive to sell the funds." 

No-load funds didn't lead to a decline in consumers investing in markets.

What if lower insurance costs INCREASE insurance buyers instead?

393 2018-09-22 17:36:55 No real disagreement from me. I think it will take a little longer than most expect but will be glad to be proved wrong. I am still buying at these low prices as I am not certain as to how long U stocks will stay this low. But very well prepared for when it does.
394 2018-09-22 17:36:44 Categorically false allegations. Not one shred of evidence. You’re really buying into what McCreath has to say? I guess then you shouldn’t be in cannabis stocks at all

397 2018-09-22 17:34:34 Have you ever posted ads of goods you don't have in stock?

403 2018-09-22 17:29:38 Homebuilder stocks fell Fri. after J.P. Morgan said it is "more cautious" about the sector's prospects, lowering ratings for 5 home builder stocks – 
reducing PulteGroup & M.D.C. Holdings to underweight & moving Beazer, Century & Meritage Homes shares to neutral from overweight.

405 2018-09-22 17:28:41 @FromValue I enjoy reading you articles on SA, particularly the multibagger pieces - great job! Can I add you to me investment group on Facebook, I write about multi-baggers/growth/value stocks. Please LMK and I will DM you an invite link to my investment group on Facebook.
406 2018-09-22 17:28:38 It never ceases to amaze me what @harborfreight actually stocks.  I didn't have any machining measuring equipment. Yeah it's not starrett. But I picked up a micrometer, dial indicator, a couple calipers, and a mag base.  I figured they'd have one shitty caliper. Nope. Everything
407 2018-09-22 17:28:28 I will add @YESBANK  and @dhfl for sure. Share market historocally proved good for "buy when all are fearful, sell when all are greedy for quality stocks." I m sure his two stocks will be back to its level from where it's failed over the time. Good investment for next 3 yrs.
408 2018-09-22 17:27:58 If I remember correctly, it is 3pm MST, if that information was correct?
409 2018-09-22 17:26:57 Indeed. Every penny I spend will be on people who have shown a proven investment in comicsgate and the fans. 
It's a sort of investment and right now I'm investing in blue chip stocks only. I have to have a return on my investment.
410 2018-09-22 17:25:03 Think about how stock splits and doubles have occurred on different stocks. There's zero chance the exchanges could settle everyone in a crash... Granted, some people would just short, but laymen would want to sell at a loss.
411 2018-09-22 17:24:52 Rise those wockhardt stocks
412 2018-09-22 17:24:38 Will cryptohub refund my dart in btc or 1 on 1 transfer to stocks exchange?
413 2018-09-22 17:24:16 I totally agree. I switched from ib for better borrows with speedtrader but barely trade low floaters and small cap flavor of the day stocks so borrows arent as necessary. Switching back next week. IB is GREAT for option trading also.
414 2018-09-22 17:23:51 The financial system is always the first place to look. 1929 ...Speculative loans used to invest in stocks, crash, 90% loss in stocks value, bank failure, asset fire sales, money supply cotraction, loss of confidence....Depression.

417 2018-09-22 17:22:12 @gatesoption just confused by all the volatility this week of the weed stocks an what it means
418 2018-09-22 17:19:38 Only time will tell although I agree that selection of the right stocks is key. Most of my stocks (not all) have done better than Uranium itself and we have seen nothing yet. The potential is very great and the early signs are starting to emerge.
419 2018-09-22 17:19:33 Speculation in US stocks is soaring while the breadth and leadership are deteriorating. High risk. $SPX
420 2018-09-22 17:19:29 He has put the American people first. Tax cuts made our checks better. Jobs growth, and I now have TWO jobs when before it was hard to keep ONE fulltime. Ending the Korean War. Highest stocks EVER. What does he have to do to impress you?
421 2018-09-22 17:18:55 Yes .. awaiting to find out a good quality stocks at under value . Your guidance will help me to find out
422 2018-09-22 17:15:43 Hej Jaz, that information is correct. Unfortunately there is no online option to order directly from the store, because we have a stock at the distribution center and separate stocks for the stores. This option is only for orders that will be picked up. ^Sharon

426 2018-09-22 17:13:32 via @bespokeinvest: This week every sector x-utes had new highs in cumulative A/D...Contrary to the argument that it's been a thin rally led by few stocks...stats show participation is across sectors.
427 2018-09-22 17:13:29 Stocks up. No thanks to Trump!
428 2018-09-22 17:13:27 FRIDAY 13:05-13:10 pm was like a MUHURAT Trading. Some fancy names were available at discounted price.. Many saw the downside, A very few picked up the potential upside #stocks #muhurattrading #equity @AvinashGoraksha @porinju @b50 @Nigel__DSouza #stockpick #ValueInvesting

431 2018-09-22 17:09:26 Yeah it's a pattern alright. Though the underlying mechanisms different for re and btc than stocks.
432 2018-09-22 17:08:16 I libtard talking about stocks... You're welcome
433 2018-09-22 17:07:53 The Rs are touting their great economy. But remember the millions that don't own stocks or have 401Ks. Their surviving on 2 or 3 minimum wage jobs that barely get them by. There are many jobs out there but they don't pay a living wage. And most of them make up Trump's base.
434 2018-09-22 17:05:14 Will this next trend reversal be accompanied by a commodities boom boosting emerging markets? Like in the 00s. Commodities to stocks ratio is near all time low
435 2018-09-22 17:05:10 Stocks of breweries are the one which are least effected by the recession have u got anyone???

438 2018-09-22 17:03:10 Buy uranium stocks? Any suggestions of which? :)
439 2018-09-22 16:59:50 yay!! I usually add extra the print according to whatever peeps order, tbh I had picked rk1700 as a random thought IM GLAD IT WORKED OUT Also I’m super bad at counting my stocks so I always have atleast 2 extra charms lying around somewhere underneath the table LOL
440 2018-09-22 16:59:11 It's right, Liquidity in market is made by contrarian&flow.
Buy when irrationality hits quality stocks.
Equity&Preference shares is cognitive quality stocks.
The market dislikes uncertainty.

442 2018-09-22 16:58:36 There goes their stocks
443 2018-09-22 16:57:59 What a crock. Regulation. Are weed stocks regulated? Yes, and they did the same
444 2018-09-22 16:57:18 2018 Goals Left

- Be more alert in stocks
- Smoke Less

445 2018-09-22 16:54:05 @LifesizeHD also stocks my favorite drink as well! Love visiting the #Austin office.
446 2018-09-22 16:51:47 What about the people who don’t own stocks or 401k??
447 2018-09-22 16:50:45 there are no stocks for army bomb ver 3 yet. we will open G.O as soon as its available. Even in Korean Offline Stores, they dont have it.
448 2018-09-22 16:49:44 Hey Stocks-n-Crypto(@StocksNCrypto), thank you for following me
449 2018-09-22 16:49:31 Sir if u share ur views on dhfl ND yes bank small market participants like me would get some benefit, sir I didn't have yesbank or dhfl but bought at lows on Friday and sold so got decent profit,what is the future of both stocks.just give some indirect hint,that would help.thanks
450 2018-09-22 16:49:22 WAIT, you bought stocks as a 3-year-old?!?! I knew you were something else.
451 2018-09-22 16:48:48 That’s unexpected.  I would have expected utilities (old man income stocks) to not do as well with higher interest rate.
452 2018-09-22 16:45:37 Yes. So it’s totally dependent on the value of the stocks at any given time.
453 2018-09-22 16:45:31 Just started doing some trading. Bought about 3 stocks today. Let’s see how this goes
454 2018-09-22 16:44:45 It assumes limited correlation within the 20-25 stocks (ie. Not owning 25 banks). The curve shown above is based on randomly selected portfolios. What else are you thinking might need to be an assumption? -Sean
455 2018-09-22 16:42:51 I am retired. I have a managed account with medium risk stocks. They are doing well but are not close to 50,60 or 70% higher. Wish they were.
456 2018-09-22 16:42:08 As usual your tweets make zero sense . “Every tweeter is a seller” wellll wouldn’t that mean you are selling everytime you tweet? People tweets stocks for a ton reasons. To help others. Get recognition. Make money. Just to analyze it/give opinion with no position at all. Tons!
457 2018-09-22 16:41:54 I have no idea about this story, however, just to inform you that O negative is the most common blood group and stocks can and do run dangerously low sometimes which is why blood donation is vital. In war-torn countries, hospitals do run out completely. Please give blood.
458 2018-09-22 16:39:34 Among national socialists
459 2018-09-22 16:39:04 I’m 18 but have been trading for 5 years and take it very seriously, you have no idea how annoying young traders can be  they either go on about Bitcoin, I markets live, or penny stocks. The next generation of traders is doomed
460 2018-09-22 16:38:55 it is crazy how much buying / selling pressure index rebalancing creates (and very little press coverage). the volume at the end of the day in $AAPL and the FANG stocks was remarkable.  $AAPL volume on Friday surpassed all company specific events in the last 1.5yrs
461 2018-09-22 16:38:00 Many things have been removed from "the public square". Stocks, people being tarred and feathered, public executions... Which is what you would expect in a modern civilization.
462 2018-09-22 16:37:46 What would make sense then? The only other possible reason for someone to tweet about stocks other than having a vested interest in a higher PPS (short or long term) what else would be the motive?
463 2018-09-22 16:37:40 @PaperBearIRL hi ! Is there anywhere in town that stocks your wedding cards? I need to get one! 
464 2018-09-22 16:37:11 Serious Q:  Ive owned Stocks since I was 5 and have never paid taxes.  I bought Crypto last year and still havent sold.  How are the two different?
465 2018-09-22 16:35:28 Indeed true.. such turbulent times, stocks as well as holder get's tested.. Much easy to filter junk

467 2018-09-22 16:32:05 Due to corps you gave tax breaks to buying back their stocks. Fake economics
468 2018-09-22 16:31:33 UI,Replying to the tweet(Jamie)implying that U guys are pumping stocks.
UI,glad your up 100.
Hope you’re up 1000 soon so I can be up 400
469 2018-09-22 16:30:52 Just about every price is going up. Take vegetables, eggs,meat, fish, soap, shampoo, medicines, restaurants increasing prices.... list is endless. Almost every new stocks have higher prices. If one doesn’t know about them he/ she is not the one who is doing the purchases.
470 2018-09-22 16:30:47 A Q for Puritan Club: When in the stocks in the privacy of one's home, is latex wear acceptable?
471 2018-09-22 16:28:44 So every stock you tweet about you are selling then? Even if you have much higher price targets? That doesn’t make sense. You tweet about stocks like the rest of us.
472 2018-09-22 16:28:31 You’re celebrating some very superficial short term gains. You need to look a little closer out what’s really going on, of course when you/corporate taxes those stocks are going to go right up. But people are working 40 - 80 hrs. still not making enough for rent. It’s not right
473 2018-09-22 16:28:28 How do you think traditional jewellery can withstand against the huge corporates backed by politicians and actors? The have more branches,stocks and designs. How do lower players sustain?

484 2018-09-22 16:17:20 Don't put so much money in psu bank .....diversify ur stocks .....IFCI N KTK BANK not gem of a stock
485 2018-09-22 16:17:00 No, because it's been outside in the weather for years, and the wood starts to rot. We'll maybe get some plastic or metal chairs and a table next year?
486 2018-09-22 16:13:45 I told my little sister before that she should be putting all of her allowance aside & buy stocks.
487 2018-09-22 16:13:35 Because of the Wednesday blustery wind?
488 2018-09-22 16:13:10 No, it isn't.  It is because of Obama policies and then you took off all the clean air/water protections and allowed the big guys to buy more stocks.  That's ok.  Historically, this rarely lasts two years.  By 2020 our economy will crash.
489 2018-09-22 16:13:07 I really need to start getting into investing in stocks
490 2018-09-22 16:13:04 Individual Stock selection concentrated is more dengerous than Sectorial or Themetical bukkey of Stocks
491 2018-09-22 16:12:33 It was falling to bits. I cut it up and it's in the firewood now.
492 2018-09-22 16:11:51 They would not be motivated to boost its Singapore stocks trading *Unless* It's winning derivatives business suffered some form of heavy losses. Though, they are suffering some losses from the nifty derivatives dispute with India, the damage still represents a small %.
493 2018-09-22 16:10:42 One of many articles reported that if Pres. Trump imposed the tariffs that our economy & markets would tumble. I knew it was an inaccurate prediction because of the people who were affected, the blow was cushioned, sales are up on US goods within, & stocks are up.
494 2018-09-22 16:10:22 Auto vs semi auto isn’t the tiniest detail. Bump stocks were used in the Vegas shooting (simulating automatic) and hundreds were hurt and killed. A lot more than any semi auto

498 2018-09-22 16:09:41 WHY ARE SHIRTS SOLDING OUT QUICK????? DO THEY ONLY HAVE SMALL STOCKS OF THEM???
499 2018-09-22 16:09:35 Let’s remember you & @SenateGOP @HouseGOP stole 1.5 Trillion from US Treasury! Gave it to wealthy & Corps who did a stock buy back! We now have a deficit that will bankrupt us in 2028 per CBO score! Only 1/3 of Citizens have stocks! 2/3 can’t afford them! It’s a fake barometer!
500 2018-09-22 16:09:33 Maybe he'll buy all the stocks and re-sell them so he could get more money lmaoooo
501 2018-09-22 16:09:29 Let me correct this for you: Tax breaks did not bring any job back. They went directly to shareholders & rebuying stocks. Wages have not gone up, prices of goods have increased and people are working 2 or 3 jobs. There is your "providing jobs back to Americans"
502 2018-09-22 16:07:59 Yeah... My stocks are at record lows as of yesterday.

Keep lying Pinocchio!
503 2018-09-22 16:07:29 Sold my first stocks for a profit yesterday and I just want to say I’m pretty damn proud of myself for learning this on my own
504 2018-09-22 16:06:05 Have you VISITED YOUR 401 to see where your money is invested. If not, then I suggest you contact your investor to move your stocks to a better category to get you more money.

You MUST WATCH YOUR MONEY & STRATEGICALLY PLAN for a BETTER RETURN.
505 2018-09-22 16:06:02 I hope @Jack $SQ develops $SW cash app so that I can directly buy and sell stocks through the app and say good bye to @TDAmeritrade !!
506 2018-09-22 16:05:12 Stocks are up 30% over Obama as interest rate are increasing. Obama economy couldn’t handle rising interest rates so they stayed low. One of the major driving factors behind the Obama market. Of course I’m speaking a foreign language to you
507 2018-09-22 16:04:40 Which would you prefer, diversification of funds in selected stocks or investing solely in index funds?
508 2018-09-22 16:04:21 My @LionsRugbyCo NOWHERE. Coaching stocks seems to have run out. 
509 2018-09-22 16:03:28 And man has my stocks gone thru the roof! Thanks DONALD J TRUMP for killing it with the economy!

512 2018-09-22 16:00:45 After 2 years of bank going up, down and all around - finally realizing that the critical key word for OTC stocks is TRADE not HOLD
513 2018-09-22 16:00:32 I screened a lot of #markets and #stocks this weekend. Found nothing really interesting. Cleaned my #watchlist and added some candidates. Maybe the market needs 1-2 weeks to set up again.
514 2018-09-22 16:00:21 Can you spell FULL EMPLOYMENT, RISING GNP, RISING WAGES, STOCKS UP $7 TRILLION?
515 2018-09-22 16:00:17 And ferry stocks whilst you are at it
516 2018-09-22 16:00:10 soit il faut attendre un peu que les stocks soient épuisés soit il faut prendre sur un autre site :( genre kpoptown
517 2018-09-22 15:59:22 Every Democrat throwing the RAPE word around in connection with that woman’s Alice In Wonderland fairytale should be horse-whipped or keel hauled or pilloried in stocks...then water-boarded... for starters
518 2018-09-22 15:59:10 The drunk people r talking bout stocks. Pucha puro lisensiyado na tong mga to ih. 
519 2018-09-22 15:58:26 Looking for penny stocks to invest in 
520 2018-09-22 15:55:31 Economy great  Jobs great  Stocks great .....Women Fuc*ed 
521 2018-09-22 15:55:11 For me 9 - 15 stocks ... Not too diversified or too concentrated ... Suits me
522 2018-09-22 15:53:26 People don’t change. Penny stocks have been around since forever and people still gamble on them with as little info as just the ticker. There will always be a search for the “gem”.
523 2018-09-22 15:53:08 i know someone who’s selling exo ls ver 2 (official) more than 100 stocks :( but unfortunately, she only sells it at thailand...... akshahsksh ph exo shops where u all at :(
524 2018-09-22 15:52:45 Saddest thing I've ever heard. I'm so embarrassed for you. WE ARE LAUGHING STOCKS. So GOP women who voted for Trump because of this don't count? Only women who would call you sexist no matter what count? It's over for the GOP if you let this slip away. Have a SPINE.
525 2018-09-22 15:51:58 Higher GDP is good for stocks and business confidence, however it drives consumer costs up too. Next quarter 3.0 estimate should help consumers a little

2.Sometimes out of stocks Sa lechon (delayed order)
527 2018-09-22 15:51:07 Be ready lots of charts coming. Tons of work being done for the upcoming week. Tons of stocks at key levels
528 2018-09-22 15:50:12 Assumption is that Diis and Fiis  bought those stocks that fell
529 2018-09-22 15:49:50 It was at an all time high when Obama left office. It didn't effect me then and it doesn't effect me now. You just like me don't own any stocks. Stop boasting about something that has never and will never effect you.

531 2018-09-22 15:49:07 More than 200 million of us will see negative effects from the #GOPTaxScam . Stocks have no bearing on what average Americans earn. Those companies have received huge tax breaks, and we have to pay for it.
532 2018-09-22 15:47:41 If all semi auto weapons, bump stocks etc had been illegal for the last 30 years, doubt Vegas would have happened. So...... yeah
533 2018-09-22 15:47:04 Thank you president Trump,  my tax cut is 160$ per week and there is so much work goong on in our city , every single union hall is empty,  there are more jobs than people willing to fill them,  my stocks in American steel have gone way up,  and also my real estate value is crazy
534 2018-09-22 15:46:52 1. what stocks have shown up on scanner i mentioned between 8:30am - 9:30am and have HELD 50% of spike 

2. which stock out of those has highest % spike (list them in order of highest %) keeping top 3-4

535 2018-09-22 15:44:55 saw my guy @StockStar319 for the first time in a minute & he’s really going crazy with the stocks. Z came a long way from the green transformer in high school
536 2018-09-22 15:44:36 my new summer pre hod breakout hot stock watchlist CRITERIA so you have a scanner scanning for stocks up 3% with 50k volume should cover pretty much everything worth looking at

539 2018-09-22 15:42:55 This is my 4th year trading first 3 were mostly on otc made a killing on that exchange. I went through a list of stocks that I have traded and many on my watchlist safe to say not one ever lived up to the promise. In other words 99.9% of otc stocks are worthless piles of garbage
540 2018-09-22 15:42:55 The next harsh step by PM MODIJI would be in ‘real estate’ sector. Mark my words. 
 All real estate stocks would be in deep trouble. 
 So avoid all real estate stocks.
All are cooked stories. 
Lets c, at the end retail investors gets trapped.

546 2018-09-22 15:35:13 If you read books to learn stocks, you'll learn what others already know.  If you trade stocks from charts and read IBD to match news and fundamentals to actual price movement, you might learn something new that no one else knows!

548 2018-09-22 15:34:25 Republicans are the “socialists,” diverting the people’s tax dollars to their corporate donors and making private corporate losses public plus not regulating negative externalities like pollution. No wonder stocks are up. The people aren’t. #CorporateWelfare

551 2018-09-22 15:32:36 The reply came today. The Brexit department dodged the question, but also downgraded "adequate food stocks" to "we believe we have [this] in hand". Which is the opposite of reassuring.

553 2018-09-22 15:31:12 Thanks, Jim. Maybe it’s something that @mjmauboussin has looked into...base rates of long-term success of stocks that were profitable at IPO, and the inverse?
554 2018-09-22 15:30:50 Totally agree, I took positions on all 3 stocks on Friday -Yes bank, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Dewan Housing from long term perspective..   I believe fundamentals don’t change overnight and Fridays market reaction might be a over panic reaction .. Time will tell and we learn!
555 2018-09-22 15:30:13 NOOOOO, IT ISN’T BY ACCIDENT!! IT’S BECAUSE ALL THE RICH WHO KEPT THEIR MONEY OUT THE MARKET, TO HURT OBAMA’S ADMINISTRATION, ARE NOW DUMPING MONEY IN MARKET TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE ITS BETTER THAN IT IS!! THEN VOON PEOPLE GET IN MARKET AND THE RICH DUMP STOCKS TO STEAL YOUR MONEY!
556 2018-09-22 15:29:13 And with inflation over 2.5% it means you don't actually gain any savings; but hey the stock market is doing good - how's your portfolio? Oh that's right, most Americans don't actually have stocks, the are for big business and financial institutions. Get a clue America
557 2018-09-22 15:28:46 The stock market feels dangerous, not because it is too "high", but because it seems properly priced. It is always properly priced till it is not. Nobody rings the bell. Remember there is risk not properly understood because it is always different. #wsj #stocks #markets #ft
558 2018-09-22 15:28:25 No evidence as of yet that companies are raising salaries. They are reinvesting in their own stocks as opposed to passing it along to their employees. Hopefully, we will see that. Does not change the debt increases.
559 2018-09-22 15:28:06 Generally, there are 2 types of stocks:

A) those that are going down.

B) those that are going up first then going down.
560 2018-09-22 15:26:21 Interesting distributions.  However to be fair, looking at the distribution of investors in any asset class is going to skew toward higher income.  Those in the lower income brackets are much less likely to invest, whether it be crypto, stocks, bonds, metals, etc.

586 2018-09-22 15:08:52 I would assert that's an illogical conclusion.  In "traditional" investing maybe, but from cannabis stocks to Tesla, the rules of traditional valuations and predictions are much less solid.  I stick with the megatrends that cannot be broken.  Electric cars WILL happen, no doubt.
587 2018-09-22 15:07:22 Instead of benefiting from record interest rate lows worlwide to fund a house building programme and infrastructure fit for the 21st century, they did the opposite by depressing the economy with austerity and stimulating casino property speculation on existing house stocks.

630 2018-09-22 14:37:07 Stocks and digital fiat are not bearer instruments, so we all *depend* on intermediaries. That's why the risk can be systemic.

653 2018-09-22 14:22:57 big whoop guess that's great news for those who own stocks which is less than 50% of Americans, most Americans are working 2 jobs and STILL not making ends meet...but wow so good to know that the really the top 1% is getting richer & richer & getting more & more tax breaks
654 2018-09-22 14:22:11 Hello! As with our latest notice we actually moved the deadline forward in a rush to secure stocks 
655 2018-09-22 14:21:51 galing tayo dito kanina @elijntolin kaso nagkaubusan na stocks sad
656 2018-09-22 14:21:28 
yes!! And yes!! We get Medical benefits from day 1. Stocks that vest in 2yrs, and we get monthly bonuses (attendance & FC productivity). Also, I want to point out that amazon prepays 95% of college tuition (associates degree) for in-demand careers.  #proudamazonian
657 2018-09-22 14:21:05 I asked something like this before to which you replied in brief "eye scanner" but I am curious to know how you come up with these charts. Do you have a watchlist of stocks, charts of which you eyeball on a regular basis ?How do you come up with a set of stocks to check regularly
658 2018-09-22 14:20:38 Today I spent lot of time but didn't find strength in stocks for short term but it is contra that on Friday FIIs and DIIs both were buyers.

So short covering inevitable till expiry on some strong counter.
659 2018-09-22 14:20:37 Poll: Who is in a better position financially?

Person 1 or 2?

Assume both the stocks and the house return 5% a year.
660 2018-09-22 14:20:20 Grabe yun mga lola sa pag suporta talagang nakipag siksikan sila sa mega mall, samantalang ako naghihintay mag replenish ang lazada ng stocks nila  nahiya ako bigla  “fake fan”.
661 2018-09-22 14:19:51 That's original. I'll bet you're one of those that when stocks were hitting records, blasted "thanks Obama". Then when they dipped some a few months ago, "ahhhh IT'S TRUMP'S FAULT, HE'S GOING TO KILL US ALL". Then, when they start hitting records again, "duh, thanks Obama"
662 2018-09-22 14:19:39 but stocks shares are low.
663 2018-09-22 14:19:35 Unlike crypto, apparently the traditional stock market actually shuts down for the weekend??
LOL I bought individual stocks on a Friday night 
I’m learning y’all. Bear with me.
664 2018-09-22 14:19:07 Strongly Dissagre
665 2018-09-22 14:17:48 Traded my stocks for the wheels i have now, planned on getting some new wheels over winter
666 2018-09-22 14:16:25 The RICHEST 10% OWN 84% of stocks. Donald and friends are doing great.  
They are 120 times wealthier than the lower middle class. That's up 112 times from 2013.  Associated Press." It's not by accident ".
667 2018-09-22 14:16:02 I read yesterday that 84% of the total value of all stocks is owned by the top 10% of wealthiest Americans. I guess Trump's buddies are REALLY happy.
668 2018-09-22 14:16:01 Not sure to understand as ETF is a custom portfolio of stocks.

What do you mean by country? Thands!
669 2018-09-22 14:15:15 Few fundamental stocks to look for during this fall: #LTFin (138) and #IGL (250) First has corrected because of bear attack on NBFC’s, (temp phenomenon) second has fallen because of rupee depreciation. (which will be passed on)
670 2018-09-22 14:15:14 A man in Saudi Arabia has installed a fridge on the street and stocks it with free food for the homeless people in his neighborhood.
671 2018-09-22 14:15:05 Congrats Meng, ADN famainely love you so much. Hope & pray there will be more stocks available to all mac stores many want to have you mac lippie like me and my sisters. Have much rest Meng, it's been a long day. Take care and God bless Meng #mainedcmMACMEGAMALL #ALDUBTeamSoldOut
672 2018-09-22 14:15:04 What I personally find peculiar is that despite the morning #Ahvaz attacks, #Iran's currency has not dropped a bit (actually gained against #USD) and stocks are up substantially. This is not normal for Iran.
673 2018-09-22 14:14:37 Stocks and jobs are all that matters to the middle class.  If your job went overseas, then you don’t care about  crowd sizes, Russia, election polls, porn stars, lawyers, unproven assault allegations, or kids being locked up for entering our country illegally.
674 2018-09-22 14:14:00 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
675 2018-09-22 14:13:19 and I trade stocks for a living...
676 2018-09-22 14:12:44 A 5-alarm incendiary gathering advocating the return of a Puritanism that brought torture to US heathens via stocks, ducking stools & witch burning. Family fun & door prizes: New World Translation bibles, ergot rye loaves, butane crosses & America’s Promise Ministries DVDs.
677 2018-09-22 14:12:33 That's one thing I'm glad i did in my 20s was invest into a few stocks. I also invested in a few start up companiee.
678 2018-09-22 14:12:17 My favorite asset class is stocks.
679 2018-09-22 14:10:45 Backtesting goes very slow... I've tried ranking stocks, and the results are bad. I then tried it as a filter for stocks, but did not find added value. I've added it to my current system. Building something from the ground up, might lead one to something.
680 2018-09-22 14:10:14 A man in Saudi Arabia has installed a fridge on the street and stocks it with free food for the homeless people in his neighborhood.
681 2018-09-22 14:07:48 Whisful thinking.
No way to replace Iran oil production.
Price will rise as soon as stocks must be replenished
682 2018-09-22 14:07:05 You have to read my tweet carefully. In this fall over the last wk, Very few good stocks fell too much & at the same time, poor quality stocks rallied. I gave the list of heavily fallen as well as poor quality stocks (99%), so that people will not fall into the trap of these Cos.
683 2018-09-22 14:06:45 Unfortunately for some buyers of stock that has gone down is that stocks can go much lower than one expects.  Picking bottoms in downtrends is a mistake unless you are good at it.
684 2018-09-22 14:05:24 I am disgusted to be working in a place that stocks such pretentious items as 'Black Garlic Ketchup' in a JAR!!!
Not only that but some bloke feckin' bought one within half an hour of me being here. #VegPatchBantz
685 2018-09-22 14:05:07 Corporates that are not getting their money from ILFS are getting their Debt MFs redeemed.

ILFS has 92000 cr debt borrowing.

Most likely, the government will ask LIC to bail it out, and that will be a bearish signal because the run will intensify.

Better to lay off stocks
686 2018-09-22 14:05:01 Many thanks to the great Barack Obama, who started the economic recovery and bull market in stocks in 2009!
687 2018-09-22 14:02:31 cub the building you saw is the hermit stock exchange and indeed it is a project by ren and doc, it's an idea by docm where they take the biggest 10 shops on the server and enlist them in the "stock exchange" where you can buy stocks into successful shops and trade them
688 2018-09-22 14:02:07 Stocks put 2017 in the form of communication and I spoke about Dr.

691 2018-09-22 14:00:15 I'm finally getting help picking stocks to invest in. Lmao I gave Robinhood 50 whole dollars. Don't know how y'all do that 9 to 5 shit.
692 2018-09-22 14:00:00 The hot topic everyone is talking about is the new round of trade tariffs in the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China. 

Are the tariffs dragging down Chinese stocks? Find out now.
693 2018-09-22 13:59:32 War only benefits those who owns stocks in military contractors, the rest of us merely die in them.
694 2018-09-22 13:58:41 Do you think big Pharma will use plant oils once biosynthesis programs up and running? I sold all my grow stocks and focusing on stocks with biosynthesis programs.

696 2018-09-22 13:53:31 Investing in Apple and google and stocks in general will not make you wealthy.
697 2018-09-22 13:52:48 I am all for RESPONSIBLE gun ownership! And #CommonSenseGunLaws! I want guns OUT of the hands of crazed maniacs! And NO ONE should own two dozen assault rifles and bump stocks. That’s just CRAZY. 

I blocked SO MANY trigger happy Trumpies after the Vegas shooting. *So* many.
698 2018-09-22 13:52:04 Good job stocks now say hello to 20 k stocks good luck
699 2018-09-22 13:52:03 Not me. Wherever do you shop that stocks these odd items?
700 2018-09-22 13:51:24 Just like the stock market.... how many of them have stocks?  Again, just sayin. That shouldn’t be a complete measure of the economy. Especially when it doesn’t help them.
701 2018-09-22 13:51:06 You can't be bearish if people are buying stocks. The whole host of hedge funds who have been bearish on stocks based on macro got it wrong. Their mistake
702 2018-09-22 13:51:05 Don’t forget -

708 2018-09-22 13:46:28 does anyone care about fang stocks?  earnings 1/80 of price.  ya, that seems right.
next time you print a trillion, just give it to the people rather then these huge tech companies, theyre going to get it anyhow.
709 2018-09-22 13:45:44 I think it's personally acceptable a stock can triple by 200 points and end the week flat.  No sir, the SEC should not do anything about stocks like this.
710 2018-09-22 13:45:32 If only that were true! Most who “own #bitcoin” at Coinbase etc prob believe they own real thing but it’s actually an IOU & it doesn’t trade at a discount. Same for stocks in brokerage accts or cash in bank accts—both are IOUs not the real thing tho sadly few prob understand that
711 2018-09-22 13:45:01 You have nothing else to talk about. Why don’t you talk about how the economy is doing good. Or people are making money in the Stocks exchange.

720 2018-09-22 13:40:08 Lowering taxes for who, what will you do when the tax break expires for middle class? The tax break didn’t help the workers. The economy is doing great because we gave more money to the wealthy to invest, buy back stocks etc which means no benefit for working class, wake up

723 2018-09-22 13:39:24 I’m game, but @lhamtil has to discuss why currency hedging international tobacco stocks automatically should increase CAPE ratios.
724 2018-09-22 13:37:58 DHFL is a stock that frequently goes to BAN period. 
I have seen such moves in the past. 
I would always refrain from those stocks which often goes to BAN period.
725 2018-09-22 13:36:58 And how many lower and middle income people have stocks? How many of them have 401ks?  Not a whole heck of a lot.  But that is OK because as long as the rich are getting richer Trump doesn't care. He only cares about a certain demographic.

728 2018-09-22 13:34:23 My co-worker spent over $100 on hair extensions. She does it almost every month. She doesn't make much money and she has a few kids. She's a hard worker and a nice girl. I suggested she start buying stocks with that money. She seemed interested, but will she?
729 2018-09-22 13:34:00 It’s the first day of hoodie and hat season. Woo! *stocks up* #FirstDayofFall but the way this global warming is set up... 
730 2018-09-22 13:33:56 Yup! I know a lot of people this has happened to. I also had a @Verizon employee lie to me about phone stocks in another store so I would buy one then and there. Once I found a store that was upfront with me and had the phone I actually wanted, I returned the one he sold me.
731 2018-09-22 13:33:42 @mitchman29 Amazon never been in a downtrend, it is one of the most bullish stocks in the Market.

741 2018-09-22 13:23:07 Look for predatory lending practices toward high value items not just Realestate automobile boats... publicly traded company’s carrying a lot of debt. They should be paying down their debt now. Stocks are over valued at this point. So look for solid earnings - a good indicator.

745 2018-09-22 13:19:53 50 to 70%??? Really? 
A - I'd love to see that documented with verifiable proof.
B - Stocks go down. Google 'Real Estate Bubble' or 'Great Recession' and see how many people lost homes, pensions and IRAs.

766 2018-09-22 13:06:53 I know alternatives exist, that's not the issue.

880 2018-09-22 10:56:38 It’s very comparable to the crypto-craze last year, but there is a little more backing the incredible rise of these stocks because there is a legitimate market for these companies that is really just at the very beginnings at this point

891 2018-09-22 10:43:13 The recovery was thanks to Obama.  You will never be able to take credit for that.  The rally on Wall Street was you.  When you handed the richest top 5% a massive tax cut it caused stocks to saur and stock buybacks has drove the market to all time highs.  Tax breaks are unfunded

901 2018-09-22 10:26:01 We're in the same boat, then? `he let out a chuckle before he raise an eyebrow. Whoa.. so that's where our ramyeon stocks went huh, to your stomach? Me- well, mingyu's influence me so much for photography so i'm still trying!
902 2018-09-22 10:22:46 All our recommendation should be added on dips. Never we will give any targets for any stocks. These stocks are for long term investments purpose only. Have proper background checks of company and knowledge before investing in any of our recommendations. Sure shot 25 to 30% CAGR.
903 2018-09-22 10:18:12 But  sir thoughtful investors only think about growth stocks whether they are available at 60 times.they are buying on 2027 earning estimates. How futuristic they are.,
904 2018-09-22 10:16:13 Also you do realize trump has nothing to do with the dow(other than when he manipulates certain stocks like amazon or threatens trade wars). More$?? You must be in the 1%? Cause the extra few$’s in my weekly check isn’t worth the trillion $ deficit!
905 2018-09-22 10:14:03 I’ll check my stocks, I may be mistaken.
906 2018-09-22 10:10:40 Hey Martin. I'm sorry to hear you didn't manage to find one in time. It was a limited release and only available while stocks last. I'll make sure and log your issue and fingers crossed we stock more next time. I hope this helps. Darryl
907 2018-09-22 10:08:30 Dans la meme veine, l'effort de peche industriel a rendu le poisson rare et cher. Autrefois la morue etait le poisson du pauvre, aujourd'hui c'est un poisson qui tourne a 20 euros le kilo. Or on sait que l'arret de la peche indus permettrait de reconstituer les stocks.
908 2018-09-22 10:07:12 I have been invested in Indian banks for some time now. Throughout this process, I have treated Indian bank stocks with nothing but respect. My portfolio expects the same. A good relationship at the end of this process depends on it.

Food stocks need to be pantry items.  Dried, canned, bottled...  oh joy!
913 2018-09-22 09:59:07 Very true and that statement will work only when one has established the correlation between all the stocks in the portfolio and hedged with nifty PE accordingly and if that were the case in most cases, then by default nothing more than an arbitrage will exist

960 2018-09-22 09:04:46 You must find the correlation between stocks and nifty ,accordingly hedge through nifty if stocks are in line with nifty or otherwise take individual stocks puts to hedge .

964 2018-09-22 08:56:46 I can't understand this common statement "buy nifty put as hedge". Will they buy for their total value of portfolio as hedge? What in case if Mkt scales up and stocks scales down like Jan 2018? Where they will exit pe?

967 2018-09-22 08:54:54 If enough people did it would.

Just look at when their stocks dropped 10% in value, they came out with the second statement saying that no decision is final yet. It's obvious they only care about money, yet fans will just keep throwing it at them...
968 2018-09-22 08:54:04 Great deals today - while stocks last !

971 2018-09-22 08:52:18 What about investing money in stocks and bonds. You can do that with penny’s and make money. Then using that money make the business. That’s how capitalism works. If one way doesn’t work try another and your sure to succeed.

974 2018-09-22 08:49:09 A friend of mine does the traditional "buy and hold" with a portfolio of 4-10 stocks. Quite stressfree for him.

Whenever he tells me how well his portfolio develops, I'm thinking about how I'm sitting in front of my trading platform 6 hours a day and barely breakeven.

980 2018-09-22 08:44:45 If Govt doesn't announce some way out of the ILFS mess, the Financial Sector Stocks will fall and take the Nifty with it. In any case the delay in doing this has shaken the confidence of lenders and caused permanent damage to the Financial Ecosystem.

983 2018-09-22 08:38:17 This could be a recee before final onslaught. Be on guard stock market folks. If some evil anti natl forces could do this right under nose of regulators, imagine panic they can create by triggering such fall on a few more quality stocks. Gov need to be proactive & not reactive.

985 2018-09-22 08:34:24 Yeah...poor people have stocks
986 2018-09-22 08:32:02 Why worry about Nifty touching bottom or whether Bottomed. Focus on individual stocks and make your earnings. Every day some thing is turning Gold or getting dusted. Focus on what's turning Gold !
987 2018-09-22 08:31:43 so how many of you have felt the enrichment of this roaring stock market? oh right not even half of you, because most people don't OWN ANY stocks, MOST people are working 2 jobs and STILL not making ends meet....so who's getting rich? the richest, the top 1% that's who!
988 2018-09-22 08:28:55 I respectfully disagree sir.
What i think is that such days are relatively easy to trade on very volatile stocks/indices like banknifty or dhfl and stuff.

The imp point is eliminating fomo and only entering at the right signal.
If you miss that, then let the trade go away

1013 2018-09-22 07:56:35 Just one little question. Assuming you have funds available and prices are favourable, how do you go about buying more of your high conviction stocks during a downtrend like this? Staggered buying in installments or all out buying in chunks? Just looking for your perspective.

1054 2018-09-22 07:17:50 You know, this whole wage debate is based on the wage offered to get us through the door. No one is talking about the rest of the FT package: the biannual raises, the monthly bonus, the full benefits DAY 1, the co stocks, the 401k, the mentor/education programs, the promotions...
1055 2018-09-22 07:16:46 While on how to handle trading losses. Many times people want to recover their losses by making profits from the same stock. It is human psychology.  But there is no need to do so. There are so many other less risky stocks that are there. 
Think about it .

1057 2018-09-22 07:14:49 hard to bet against it & I wouldn't, seems a few bitter folk out there, clearly on traditionals we can all see it's overvalued, however, Aim stocks don't work like that for very very long periods, under/over valued can be for a year/ two or more & vice versa, well done VRS I say

1064 2018-09-22 07:09:02 Aim mover metrics' frustrating a few as some stocks keep gaining. Most can value company on 'traditionals', picking an AIM mover  NOT the same. Better to be lucky in a riser than skillful in a non  mover/faller. Stocks go up & down so both will be right at some  point 
1065 2018-09-22 07:08:51 A Long Due Correction Has Set Up Its Stage For Next Week. I see a major correction in #Nifty50 and #Sensex. About 350-500 Points In Nifty.

1170 2018-09-22 05:07:55 @FantasticNifty 
Like your YouTube Channel. Your analysis is good. Can you advice what strategy to deploy with Yes Bank and DHFL. Avg or exit or wait and watch? I hold both stocks which I believed was a good buy price until yesterday . Is this panic selling or there to stay?
1171 2018-09-22 05:07:40 Yes, kawawa ibang branches. Kawawa kami.  And meron pa dapat stocks for the mall events in the succeeding weekends. Eh paano???

1174 2018-09-22 05:05:07 The intelligent investor should sell the stocks when they have advanced enough instead of keeping them held for long. Always buy a stock with a Satisfactory price earnings ratio, strong financial position and prospects of sustainable growth.
1175 2018-09-22 05:04:37 Most of us don't own stocks, and the majority of Americans don't have 401k's. Why should I be excited about this? How about helping those of us who barely keep our heads above water?

1202 2018-09-22 04:48:01 The HFC default were during UPA but it was highlighted by the NDA... 
We need some more highlights.

Point is simple.. Buy fundamentally strong stocks with higher dividend and growth potential trading at low when markets make high or break low.
Stoploss is for intraday traders.

1213 2018-09-22 04:42:13 Back in the early days, every Microsoft employee got some stocks as pay. So the gardening and cleaning staff become millionaires. I wonder how many of tham actually believed to can code a DOS line?
1214 2018-09-22 04:41:45 Purchasing rental properties is a long-term investment with much less volatility than stocks.
1215 2018-09-22 04:38:49 Ang dami inubos nyo na po ang stocks 
1216 2018-09-22 04:37:59 In the mean time your 401K management company is still buying new stocks but at higher amounts. By the time you retire in however many years, who knows what stocks will look like at that date in time. High stocks only good if your selling!
1217 2018-09-22 04:37:51 If you keep on following SL then you may never hold any stocks for compounding. 
There are always dips in stocks, good or bad.  Rather if a stock is good one should add on dip not sell.
1218 2018-09-22 04:37:26 But it smells good. Plus its the thing i get paid in and buy stuff with, its value fluctuates somewhat, but its stable enough for daily use. But investing is different, buying etfs, mutual funds, stocks, bonds, land, commodities, and currencies is how your money gains value >

1225 2018-09-22 04:31:58 Tax cut given corporations. corporations used money to buy Back stocks. Bonuses to people who are compensated by fact that the stock prices went up.

1237 2018-09-22 04:25:48 What the Indian housing stocks collapse showed everyone yesterday was that...The first casualty of recession would be housing and the recession of late 2019/ early 2020 would see lot of homes being lost due to unservicable loans #recessiontrailer
1238 2018-09-22 04:25:26 "What are the best 3 schemes to invest in today?" Is a Q I'm often asked. 
Well how can I prescribe a medicine to you without knowing your medical condition ? 
Financial health is as important as physical health. Don't pop pills/ schemes & stocks so easily.
1239 2018-09-22 04:24:39 I’m thinking, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday are gonna rock n roll for the stocks. $acb to $15 by Wednesday. $20 will be easy once we uplist and announce coke deal.
1240 2018-09-22 04:24:28 When bubble burst stocks don't fall 20-30% and bottomed out.. These stocks fall 60-70% but first dip is always bought by layman thinking they got good deal.. NBFCs bubble is burst..
1241 2018-09-22 04:23:45 Sad that people are looking at individual stocks than a portfolio. Precisely for that reason should investors stick to a portfolio approach.
1242 2018-09-22 04:21:08 $GTXI Clay also said stocks like this that go down fast also have the same potential to go up . Keep your  on this one . I bought 5 calls

1251 2018-09-22 04:14:59 Your desire to replace money in its entirety with a “portfolio” is an echo of this fiat era that we are in, where due to constant government printing, one is supposed to keep a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, munis, currencies, fx, commods just to preserve their wealth.
1252 2018-09-22 04:14:36 Sir i bought 500 capital first as per your recommendation @ 550 and i am ready to hold it for 3 years. Now sir i want to buy 100 stocks of Siemens is it right time to enter or not ??

1265 2018-09-22 04:02:21 I would agree, but only for crypto since it has different fundamentals than stocks or other securities. Crypto could be adopted at anytime and leave you behind if you aren't just HODLING!
1266 2018-09-22 04:01:10 Happens in stocks too there guy. The point of crypto is that it can't be regulated because its decentralized and immutable which is the reason it holds value. DEX's will eventually take over all markets so good luck with regulation that only benefits the wealthy

1288 2018-09-22 03:41:42 Wow grabe sold out, congrats Meng, hope and pray more stocks will be available soon @maccosmeticsph @MACcosmetics #mainedcmMACMEGAMALL #ALDUBTeamSoldOut
1289 2018-09-22 03:41:23 That's odd our stocks went down. We made the most profits while Obama was in office not Trump!
1290 2018-09-22 03:39:48 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
1291 2018-09-22 03:38:49 Dito smen sa Binondo walking distance lng kme to Lucky China Town so cguro nmn malaki chance ko to have it haha later punta ko dun gabi to confirm what time open nd kung my stocks sila haha
1292 2018-09-22 03:38:16 $hear , $CIEN , $fnko $FOCS, $SAIL $PETQ $VNOM $GMED ... some stocks I just scanned that look promising for next week! ..will dive into em more tomorrow and sunday and post the charts
1293 2018-09-22 03:36:06 Why RBI & SEBI silence? in organised manner encouraging naive people to invest money in risky specualtive financial instruments, 
It is mainly Low & middle income guys in greed to make big money quickly bet their money to invest in stocks are the ones losing their shirts,
1294 2018-09-22 03:35:02 You forget, most people do not own 401Ks or other stocks. And those that do don't care about current values but their value when they retire. So the only people who are glad to see the buoyant market are those who are wealthy.
1295 2018-09-22 03:34:37 I feel like if you buy weed stocks now, in 5-7 years what are the odds you don’t make bank on that, the more states legalize it the bigger the market the more money these companies make.
1296 2018-09-22 03:34:04 All of this is spectacularly wrong  Neither stocks nor indices move out of their own power or have a conscience  Saying that anything bounced off of the value of an arithmetic calculation is the biggest falsehood ever
1297 2018-09-22 03:32:56 If my 401k was up 70%, I would retire right now but it is not and I'm 85% invested in stocks.  Stop lying.
1298 2018-09-22 03:31:26 The stock market is not just for the rich.  The majority of Americans are invested in the stock market.  Why do you assume single parents are too incompetent to own stocks?
1299 2018-09-22 03:31:20 Stock Market crash! Business news channels job is to report Business Economics Politics related news, and not to provide Investment advisory services, people with vested interest tempting gullible folks to invest in high risk specualtive financial instruments Stocks & Commodities
1300 2018-09-22 03:30:19 Dapat po talaga thousands stocks meron sila  para d nauubusan iba kasi po purchasing power ng phenomenal sold out queen @mainedcm natin po congrats

1301 2018-09-22 03:29:52 Maybe if you bought Stocks and have stocks it would go up! can’t have anything go up if you don’t own any!! ha ha
1302 2018-09-22 03:29:08 @RyderRadke if this isnt you idk what is. lmao
1303 2018-09-22 03:28:01 The week at /tlry112.5 after hours could mean a gap down through $100 in the coming days and a stunning readjustment in price that ultimately could take it lower than its IPO. Sam Zell commented on Wall Street week that stocks that go to 125 x earnings are unsustainable and more
1304 2018-09-22 03:27:54 There’s one for stocks too
1305 2018-09-22 03:27:19 I don’t know bout u, but I’m def not investing in stocks! Don’t care what u say J! 
1306 2018-09-22 03:26:30 There's no denying those statistics. Even schleprocks like me are making good money trading stocks! We couldn't do it without you Mr. President. Not without you. 
1307 2018-09-22 03:25:51 And stop equating your personal success or even peoplesto the stock market. 90 percent of the middles and low class dont have stocks
1308 2018-09-22 03:25:36 Whatttt??!!!!! Another teary eyes again to some fans out there na pupunta palang or nasa linya pa! Bakit ang konti lang nilagay na stocks for MaineMAC Lippie ? @mainedcm @MACcosmetics

1310 2018-09-22 03:24:41 What is wrong if you buy back stocks??? What is wrong is if you steal the money from government???
1311 2018-09-22 03:23:32 We have not yet made up what the fat rich cats took in 2008. Some people in the red states have no stocks.
1312 2018-09-22 03:22:59 My stocks aren’t up, but the price of groceries sure are...
1313 2018-09-22 03:22:39 I don’t mind the masterwork economy really. Mod components are a little scarce tho for anyone who didn’t stock up. Once our stocks are gone, I think we’re gonna feel it much more.
1314 2018-09-22 03:21:32 So basically Wal Mart stocks their stores with nothing but foreign material right?? Well if they do that  and I have to pay high prices anyway then I’ll be buying that stuff from Target!
1315 2018-09-22 03:21:10 Okay, I'm a democrat, but if your stocks are not up - if you actually have stocks - then you really need to get out of the stock market!
1316 2018-09-22 03:20:55 @jimcramer Hey Jim, young investor here! I'm trying to do my homework when it comes to bank stocks; however, I want to know where to start. Thanks Jim!
1317 2018-09-22 03:20:53 The question now is how soon can MAC replenish the stocks when the 20k is sold out? Sana may 2nd batch.

@mainedcm | #mainedcmMACMEGAMALL
1318 2018-09-22 03:19:37 You bought the wrong stocks dummy !!!
1319 2018-09-22 03:18:43 Megamall wala n stocks
1320 2018-09-22 03:17:44 Going into the weekend we have decided to put our money into some stocks that will report earnings very soon. Companies like FexEx and Auto Zone showed great progression through the quarter and should increase our portfolio earnings come the end of the month
1321 2018-09-22 03:17:11 If your stocks aren't up then you invested in the wrong ones. Your fault not Trumps. Gas prices go up and down all the time. Most of the gas price is because of state taxes put into gas sales. Not Trumps fault either.
1322 2018-09-22 03:17:06 My 401(k) did not go up, my stocks maybe 8%. Does anyone know anybody who's 401(k) went up 50% just like that?
1323 2018-09-22 03:17:06 no one knows what is happening except scree. Respect the screen.
1324 2018-09-22 03:16:21 My stocks are up too....oh wait, I have to work 2 jobs in your "amazing job market" to pay my bills, I don't even have money for stocks! Must be nice you rich, greedy bastards!
1325 2018-09-22 03:15:47 Maverick stocks are going go down once more stuff is LEAKED !
1326 2018-09-22 03:15:15 Yup. Stocks being up does not mean wages are up. The president does not understand it though. “We had a gdp less than 0 in some cases!” -trump
1327 2018-09-22 03:14:25 Because corporations keep BUYING BACK THEIR OWN STOCKS, AND ARTIFICIALLY INFLATING THE MARKET!!!!
1328 2018-09-22 03:14:08 Between the new funding, the upcoming cse listing which triggers 450k from a current lender / partner, fnhi is poised for a nice move, but unlike other otc stocks it has real products and real sales to keep the momentum going forward after the short term rise
1329 2018-09-22 03:13:47 Thank God you aren't running the country, the market at an all time high and you didn't make any money..lol
You should cry yourself to sleep tonight..
Pot stocks all the way!!
1330 2018-09-22 03:13:44 For your stocks to not be up since nov 2016 you have to have a historically bad approach to investing.  A chimpanzee would be up 30%+ in this mkt.
1331 2018-09-22 03:13:28 You're a #DUMMY The DJIA is made up of 30 stocks and sometimes they are switched out for stronger stocks.  Also not everyone has a 401k  Also let me explain this 1 more time.  Stocks go up stocks go down.  If they kept going up no one could afford them.  IE @Apple
1332 2018-09-22 03:13:21 What apps do you use to buy stocks?
1333 2018-09-22 03:13:15 rape is real and traumatic!  And for the victims a life time trauma! You however think the politics of race and rape! The real politics is the Republicans are morally empty, tariff crazy, international my laughing stocks. There's more but Twitter can't handle the volume!
1334 2018-09-22 03:13:11 and all you people who can't buy stocks because you're busy buying gas to get to work so you can maybe buy milk, you're cool too.. 
1335 2018-09-22 03:12:59 You don't havebany stocks. But you probably are a stockboy.
1336 2018-09-22 03:12:24 Then you must have the wrong picks...or no stocks! Too bad.
1337 2018-09-22 03:12:10 You are a horrible stock picker then. I would stop buying stocks if you're that bad.
1338 2018-09-22 03:12:02 which year deepavali?
1339 2018-09-22 03:12:01 Not my stocks, I bet on the Republican party
1340 2018-09-22 03:11:55 There is a high probability that the people behind him don’t even own stocks or have a 401K
1341 2018-09-22 03:11:47 Bank share value down 25% in a year. Watch bank stocks tank further. $A will go to 50 Cents. Banks will continue to raise interest rates independent of the Reserve in an attempt to Maintain profits. More foreclosures. Lower values. Inflation and unemployment up. Immigration down.
1342 2018-09-22 03:11:38 Haluh uminit na.ulo ng mga nasa MegaMall
Dapat dinamihan yung stocks as in sobra kasi syempre maBBM din ako kung ako nandun
1343 2018-09-22 03:11:20 wait, the screen will tell you this.
1344 2018-09-22 03:10:14 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
1345 2018-09-22 03:10:12 one can listen to all channels. But decision should be one's own. You can't blame any channel for your decision.
1346 2018-09-22 03:09:27 Maybe some of the many stocks in a 401k portfolio have increased this amount or will in the next three-six months (what the market really means)... anyone going to look at it after this speech is too dumb to count percentage points anyway!
1347 2018-09-22 03:09:19 Anyone can buy stocks.  Trump's boom could help anyone with a little research and a few hundred bucks.
1348 2018-09-22 03:08:51 Stocks, record high.. What else would they be, after 45 gave all the rich people a huge cut in taxes. Use your brain!!
1349 2018-09-22 03:08:45 Pretty neat concept for Ultimate; being able to set special mode modifiers to individual players, eg 1 player is always big or metal, or 1 person has stamina and everyone else has stocks. They already do this in event mode matches, and it'd be easy enough to do and a lot of fun
1350 2018-09-22 03:07:16 Most of the stocks I see floating around on Twitter are also readily available on MarketSmith - FYI
1351 2018-09-22 03:06:21 In a growing economy like India, progress is permanent and set backs are temporary.
Don't look your portfolio frequently otherwise you would sell the slow movers quality stocks too early. 
1352 2018-09-22 03:05:50 For example now, stocks return a dividend yield of less than 1.7%. That means that they take some earnings and use them to re-invest to preserve growth, and pay out the rest to be spent on consumption. You are getting 1.7% not 4%
1353 2018-09-22 03:04:53 Value of all the stocks I have went from around $3100 to $5200 this week 

Ayeee

1355 2018-09-22 03:02:47 So we should let Americans write our drug laws? What precisely is your proposed alternative? And how precisely will Americans know whether someone owns stocks in marijuana companies?

1357 2018-09-22 03:02:02 I’m one of those average folks, and my income is up slightly and my take out tax is lower. I know people who now have jobs after looking a long time. Stocks up means business is good and expanding. I think things are looking good.
1358 2018-09-22 03:01:16 And 80% of stocks are own by the rich, so they overwhelmingly benefit the rich.
1359 2018-09-22 03:00:52 Okay. Seriously. My phone is listening to me. I never Googled 3M before. I told my students about 3M stocks today and now I have 3M recruitment videos showing up on my Instagram ads...

1365 2018-09-22 02:56:23 Similar to stocks but you’re basically buying and selling foreign currencies. I know some ppl who don’t even work they just do that
1366 2018-09-22 02:56:20 Andon ang hubby ko kasi nasa hk ako. Sabi nia ang haba nga ng pila den 1 lippie at a tym na lang per person. Kasi ang haba pa daw ng pila para makabili din iba. Kakasad kasi kulang lage stocks nila. Ang haba pa naman ng pila. Hehe #mainedcmMACMEGAMALL #ALDUBTeamSoldOut
1367 2018-09-22 02:54:52 Well if he moves I bet the McDonald’s stocks will take a hit here in the US.
1368 2018-09-22 02:53:06 giving a plug to the tickermonkey  @TCMLLC  before I joined o would see all these  in same stocks I was watching.  They know their stuff and they know how to hold for big move.
1369 2018-09-22 02:52:52 I read somewhere na every MAC outlet is appropriated 600 pieces each. I suppose this includes the provinces, too. Not sure if this is correct, but I must have read this somewhere. But Mega Mall should have more stocks sana, public launching kasi eh.

1370 2018-09-22 02:52:51 My stocks in Canadian cannabis companies aren’t doing as good as I thought they would dam.
1371 2018-09-22 02:52:25 I was waiting for something like that. If that had gone on for another 10 minutes or so some of my favourite stocks would have come down to levels comfortable enough for me to start nibbling. Maybe Monday 
1372 2018-09-22 02:52:05 Stocks are different idiot. Did he say stocks? No, he said 401k's
1373 2018-09-22 02:51:26 Oh yeah I'm on it! My LCS stocks quite a few @ALTERNACOMICS but by Saturday afternoon they're sold out! So time to add them to my pull list. I have a lot of openings. I'm serious about dropping image.

1388 2018-09-22 02:39:55 Agree. OBAMA GDP hit 5.2 in Q3 ‘14. Let’s hope TRUMP can do as well and keep the increases going up in the important areas that OBAMA set the standard for. I would certainly applaud his success. Stock mkt has been excellent for me in 18, stocks are up 38%, SBO 401K up greatly to.
1389 2018-09-22 02:39:35 Anybody know anything about stocks? I’m buggin if i take some out ?
1390 2018-09-22 02:39:15 All nbfc are five to 6 times; overvalued one day these stocks crash surely. All stock will touch 3 years low of large caps
1391 2018-09-22 02:39:12 One of Buffett's Quote that has always stuck - "You shouldn't own common stocks if a 50% decrease in their value in a short period of time would cause you acute distress" 

Well experienced it first hand yesterday with DHFL (1/n)
1392 2018-09-22 02:38:51 The markets tend to rise when the wealthy benefits from tax hand outs.  Unfortunately, only 40% of the working poor are into stocks.

1402 2018-09-22 02:32:27 RBF is a legitimate epidemic right now. It’s never been this bad. But why? Is it trump? Is it the decrease in unemployment? Record stocks market? Clean drinking water? Or that you can afford those nasty designer ripped mom jeans?
1403 2018-09-22 02:29:48 Pickle Stocks just went up 1000pts 
1404 2018-09-22 02:29:31 One more observation on the evening: These @EldoraSpeedway Stocks look like they'd be an absolute blast to wheel around there.
1405 2018-09-22 02:29:28 Do not agree entirely. What saves is a high quality stocks and a sound investment strategy. Can discuss in depth on pvt message.
1406 2018-09-22 02:28:34 Seriously? Ibenta na nila yung stocks nila for tomorrow 
1407 2018-09-22 02:28:27 Obsession with 20 stocks n their related issues exposed by direct Saturn...Frankly expected it to over by 18th..Let's see.
1408 2018-09-22 02:27:21 Trading has been profitable, you try to make the money when you can because the summers is usually slower and not as active so you try to trade whatever movements of stocks you can.

1410 2018-09-22 02:25:47 I think the panic in the market is overrated. Decrease in ter of 20-25 bp won't matter a lot the Industry itself is suppose to grow at freaking 20% p.a. . I think this is the time when big players would enter the stocks by selling panic.
1411 2018-09-22 02:24:58 I like your positive outlook on the future but no matter what “space” you are in (Crypto, Stocks, Other shit spaces) there will always be haters, liars, negative people. You have to remove these people from your life. #LongPost
1412 2018-09-22 02:24:51 Kainis. Dalawa ang MAC store sa Megamall at sila daw pinakamaraming stocks pero wala na both.
1413 2018-09-22 02:24:17 So Monday gap up possible ??
1414 2018-09-22 02:23:33 Long strangle opportunities are few but profitable. You may get 1 to 3 stocks per month. But this current uncertainty will increase opportunities. To bring  theory to real life, the only way is to trade it and enjoy profits or suffer losses.
1415 2018-09-22 02:22:21 So update ko lang po kayo. Ubos na din stocks sa megamall at kakaopen lang ng mall. Huhu sadlayp friends.

1421 2018-09-22 02:18:09 No trades today! Still monitoring swings in $S , $VIPS , $CHK . Waiting for some clarification on $BIOAQ and staying patient with my low 20s average on $HEAR (holidays coming). Newest trend I’m looking at is airline stocks heading into the Oct-Dec months ($AAL , $LUV , $DAL)
1422 2018-09-22 02:17:19 SL for a trader is a must, however for an investor these panic falls are an opportunity to BUY and avg..
Eg: Nestle Intraday low was 9200
Britannia Intraday low was 5370
Maruti 7600...quality stocks available 30% down from peak..

1424 2018-09-22 02:15:24 SOME businesses MAYBE but NOT MOST or ALL.  MOST have bought stocks into their OWN business.
1425 2018-09-22 02:13:45 OHMYOGD IM SORRY THATS SO SAD OMG IM THANKFUL THAT THEY HAVE A LOT OF STOCKS HERE IN MY COUNTRY
1426 2018-09-22 02:13:43 Cause it's not illegal for them to take advantage of insider trading. They are allowed to buy up stocks in companies they are getting ready to approve. Only illegal when us plebs do it.

I’m trying to get that long term money
1428 2018-09-22 02:12:40 I bet you love your stocks right now.
1429 2018-09-22 02:12:15 Yes if you bought at 0.05 or on the first spike .. it's different now. These stocks, most of them, have millions of more shares out and a lot of bag holders waiting to sell out.
1430 2018-09-22 02:11:52 Also, don't know if you're into stocks and used to talk a bunch about $QCOM but that's what it says on your bio. 'You're just here to talk about Qualcomm' LOL

1432 2018-09-22 02:08:15 Why are you firing workers while you have extra billions to buy back stocks?? You are damaging our nation by hurting the working class instead of lifting them up. You got huge tax breaks. Why not invest in your employees?

1437 2018-09-22 02:00:40 People will spend 50k in student loans but won’t invest 5k in stocks.
1438 2018-09-22 02:00:34 Hey how is it possible that a stock was in a bubble? I thought stock market guys do FA and find intrinsic value and only then 'invest'. I thought Tilray led a paradigm shift and stocks were moving to an era of eternal prosperity.
1439 2018-09-22 01:59:43 Two of Platio’s features in particular got the conference buzzing. First, the ability to manage all your assets, whether crypto, fiat or stocks, from the same log-in.

1440 2018-09-22 01:56:55 Don't agree with you entirely. Stoploss saves for low quality stocks. For high quality stocks such a day gives an opportunity to buy.

1444 2018-09-22 01:51:51 Which mayhem sir, we are only 500 points down from top. I  want to see nifty correction of 20 %, So froth of most of the stocks is removed.
1445 2018-09-22 01:51:02 If you got a portfolio of GREAT stocks, even days such as yesterday don't give much buying opportunity!

1446 2018-09-22 01:50:57 As long as my stocks and 401k continues to grow, I'll stick with Trump. My life and income has greatly improved with a business guy as president.

1450 2018-09-22 01:43:18 conspiracy theory of mine, market cap to volume ratios in stock market are way lower than crypto. Less stocks change hands, making crypto more decentralized by trading nature.
1451 2018-09-22 01:42:38 Kissing Trillz, stocks and Reagan for every sub? I’m hella down tbh
1452 2018-09-22 01:41:42 You know a FURU when they come up with the wierdest watchlists. Creating a watchlist is the easiest part of trading, and then they come up with some random tickers that nobody is watching, then they want to say they dont pump stocks.
1453 2018-09-22 01:41:12 I noticed this too.  My returns weren’t great this week, and that usually means I need to take it as a warning sign.  Stocks moved but reversed quickly.  Momentum felt like it slowed way down.
1454 2018-09-22 01:40:39 I miss the days when i had time to spend on twitter watching foolishness unfold..between work and day trading stocks..10 minutes of not paying attention to business can cost me way to much..so now i play catch up

1459 2018-09-22 01:36:59 I upgraded my Apple iPad Air 2 & iPhone 7 Plus both to the new iOS 12.0.  Things went fine and many things feel snappier!  That’s always nice.  Biggest complaint: the new Stocks app on the iPad moved my icons, easily fixed of course, and I welcome having it. So, so far, so good!

1467 2018-09-22 01:24:47 401k’s up 50-70% ???  Maybe some individual stocks ... average American probably isn’t gonna risk their retirement by throwing it all into one pot ...
1468 2018-09-22 01:24:20 It doesn't matter how many people it hurts or kills, as long your side gets free crap, that's all you care about.
1469 2018-09-22 01:21:28 Or you can LOOK at all the last 10 years trend in: Unemployment, stocks, GDP, trade etc and then if you still think trump gets credit you are basically in denial. Fact is if the Oval Office chair was empty last 1-1/2 years the US would have probably done better.
1470 2018-09-22 01:21:21 I find it odd that brokers "get off" on stocks that go down.  I can't imagine a doctor laughing at a patient who got sick.  That's why AUM based RIA's will always be considered brokers

1480 2018-09-22 01:07:14 I think it's wise you deleted this tweet. 
Does nothing but makes you look ignorant to the facts. 
Please, tell me, what have you done to change policy? 
Other than invest in inflated stocks for companies that aren't even leaders in the industry.
1481 2018-09-22 01:06:14 I don’t know  what else can invest my money  on in stocks and bonds
1482 2018-09-22 01:06:12 Just Shut-up and be happy your stocks are doing well in Trumps economy Sloopy Dog.
1483 2018-09-22 01:05:20 Of course the stocks have had record highs. Only rich people buy stocks. Trump gave them a lot of money thru the tax cuts. Instead of investing in their businesses, they bought stocks in their businesses. Besides STOCKS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE JOBS REPORTS.
1484 2018-09-22 01:04:48 They're called penny stocks for a reason though.

1487 2018-09-22 00:59:51 I am guessing you guys worship Donald Trump. here's an exact quote from the president:

“I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks!”

weird - he agrees with me.
1488 2018-09-22 00:59:35 Now we are up to 29 sprint cars and 8 Street stocks

1491 2018-09-22 00:57:21 I have stocks and an IRA. Neither are showing growth but Oil will go up is my prediction because of Trumps new allies Saudi, Kuwait and Russia

1506 2018-09-22 00:43:38 Following the rule of buy low and sell high is probably why stoners don’t own a lot of stocks

1510 2018-09-22 00:40:08 A) America has the resources to take care of Americans in need and people fleeing horrific situations B) @GOP can you clarify for me exactly how you are supporting Americans in need? A rising stock market does not help people who can’t afford stocks.
1511 2018-09-22 00:38:23 They should play K-Mo the whole time these street stocks are on the track.
1512 2018-09-22 00:38:06 What makes you think these are my only investments? Also, genius, what makes you think all investments pay off in less than a year? And finally, counting dividends, these stocks DID gain in value. Now, let's see YOUR portfolio so I can scrutinize and analyze it.
1513 2018-09-22 00:37:05 Market capitalisation of listed stocks =/= size of the economy. A very capitalist metric to choose, and not the right one!

You certainly don’t want to dirty your clean self with the profits that will be realized in this Trump economy! Sell it all!
1527 2018-09-22 00:21:59 The fascinating thing is that you don’t make what should be a valid choice from happiness, but bitterness. It’s why so many laugh at your movement, it makes utter laughing stocks of you all.

1541 2018-09-22 00:01:38 While U.S stock markets hit new all-time highs this week & all appears healthy, I can’t help but feel that something’s amiss. Downside leadership (new lows, declining stocks & downside volume) show there’s some “rot” under the surface, auguring for an overdue pullback very soon.

1550 2018-09-23 23:44:57 By this time tomorrow night, should be upgrading my Mac to #Mojave (macOS 10.14). Dark Mode is OK, but am really looking forward to the macOS versions of the News and Stocks apps—as Apple gets us ready for an era when devs can build for both OSs at the same time.

1554 2018-09-23 23:37:49 I’m very fond of Wheatley’s talent with characters who aren’t very intelligent. Too many directors make characters lacking intelligence into laughing stocks or undeserving of empathy; he doesn’t.

1590 2018-09-23 23:22:09 I've been looking at some of the stocks. Even after some air was let out late last week a glance at the "large" companies: 10 to 90 million in 12-mo revenue, 2 to 11 billion in mkt cap.
1591 2018-09-23 23:22:08 I didn't lose my retirement in 2007 so i'm guessing you didn't put your money in safer funds and only put a smaller amount in stocks. You are supposed to be the finance expert working in that field for 30years. I'm sorry for your predicament but you attacked me and I fought back.
1592 2018-09-23 23:21:18 Yeah kaso limited stocks haha
1593 2018-09-23 23:19:39 Dog being served as food comes from only one province in China, as their local tradition. It is said that they kept and eat dogs as life stocks the same way as cattle and pigs, but I can assure you Chinese people in general dislike this fashion and are trying to stop it.
1594 2018-09-23 23:18:26 Thank you so much man!
1595 2018-09-23 23:18:11 So whoever controls the best appraising process in the domain name space will ultimately control that market. Can you imagine the huge advantage if you were the only person on Wall Street who knew how to appraise stocks.....?

1597 2018-09-23 23:18:01 Super premium .Com domains will have some value forever, like NYSE stocks; the issue is what is that value. Hundreds of people are qualified to appraise stocks but almost none in domains.
1598 2018-09-23 23:16:09 Nope. I don't want to remove all pistols. My argument is easier to argue with if you just make it up yourself. Assault rifles. That's it. Bump stocks. Expanded magazines. Anything designed to kill lots of people. Guns are used for self defense, and should be. Rifles, to hunt.
1599 2018-09-23 23:16:06 boost America can't afford to buy stocks in stock market because they're working their ass off to pay their damn bills and I'm sure you understand that unless you're one of the lucky ones which I doubt because you're on Twitter talking shit
1600 2018-09-23 23:11:23 You can travel to the states if you own Doritos stocks. You apparently can't if you own pot stocks 
1601 2018-09-23 23:10:35 I need to buy stocks, NOW
1602 2018-09-23 23:07:08 Nous recevons de Dieu en abondance. Toutefois, Il n'a jamais connu une rupture de stocks.
1603 2018-09-23 23:06:00 Really good ;-) Got mine at Fullybooked Eastwood. Not sure though if they have more stocks
1604 2018-09-23 23:04:59 I just played icons 1v1s for an hour and i haven't dropped a game. a lot of 3 stocks coming out, nobody plays this game anymore :/
1605 2018-09-23 23:04:54 Aussie shares appear poised to open lower. Wall Street latest rally mostly faded amid a pullback in tech stocks. ASX futures were down 23 points at 7.45am Saturday AEST after Wall Street closed mixed. $RZI #ASX #finance #shares #stockmarket
1606 2018-09-23 23:02:49 In all honesty I was consistently dodging in, all he did was read that and that was the first two stocks
1607 2018-09-23 23:02:32 Not a terrible article. They are still hooked on the idea of a bubble for the whole industry. For some stocks that is correct but for the ones with solid fundamentals TRST APH  thats not correct.
1608 2018-09-23 23:02:29 Thanks.  For me these speciality funds with a limited life seem to be a poor bet.  If the investment opportunity is fantastic it could do well.  However, speciality funds always seemed to be launched after a bullish run.  Japanese stocks here with P2P Trust another example.
1609 2018-09-23 23:01:52 Top 4 stocks to watch for the week: $KFRC, $MAIN, $RHI, $SIMO, all may climb w/in 11, 16, 15, 12 days up to 6.3%, 2.3%, 5.9%, 8.3% respectively 
1610 2018-09-23 22:59:28 We need to increase the minimum age to buy a gun from 18 to 21 and you should have a permit in order to purchase a gun, if you want to own a gun you must be required to own a gun safe, a ban on assault weapons and bump stocks or magazines, and training classes before buying a gun
1611 2018-09-23 22:58:04 Which Americans exactly? I don't own stocks at Wall Street and I obviously cannot afford buybacks. We average Americans on the island are not sensing this "success".
1612 2018-09-23 22:56:28 Not like most stocks are at ath prices    think how much higher it be if he wasn’t their mascot
1613 2018-09-23 22:51:29 Market tea leaves not offering much this weekend...AAII Spread = 0, Daily Oscillators I would say point UP, Weekly DOWN, There are slightly more QQQ stocks overbought than Oversold, the opposite is true of FFTY stocks.   A week of CHOP?
1614 2018-09-23 22:50:47 Good old-fashion stocks, let the crowd throw rotten food at 'em. I'm there!
1615 2018-09-23 22:46:17 US trading volume spiked to the highest level since February in anticipation of the S&P 500 sector change, when telecoms will be folded into a new sector called communications services, along with heavy-hitting stocks such as @facebook and @WaltDisneyCo

1623 2018-09-23 22:32:34 Because the Trumpers are ready to parrot talking points. The stock market is helping CEO and companies with buy backs of stocks. Most companies are not investing that back into more wages for employees. Sure a once time bonus is something to give a short emotional feel.
1624 2018-09-23 22:32:15 Stocks are even on Fire with all those Ws

1626 2018-09-23 22:30:27 @TheNotoriousMMA where stocks @ProperWhiskey in uk?
1627 2018-09-23 22:27:28 There is no "magic." Tax the top fairly. Go back to Eisenhower era tax rate for wealthy. Tax the hell out of Wall Street. Worst disparity in wealth since the Guilded Age. Make corps pay their fair share, instead stealing from workers & buying stocks back.
1628 2018-09-23 22:27:14 Stocks up bigly tomorrow. Book it.
1629 2018-09-23 22:26:25 adulting is knowing ur life isn’t so bad when ur stocks and ur portfolio is on the come up 
1630 2018-09-23 22:25:48 Yes then fight impeachment for 2 years and stocks crash bonds ok
1631 2018-09-23 22:23:59 Ok...you don’t like booming...then this “Nike company shares rose by 36 percent, "making the company the top performer on the Dow's index of 30 blue-chip stocks." All I care is that it’s going up and not down.
1632 2018-09-23 22:20:49 Bring back the stocks for them. We can put all the spoiled food that's been stuck at customs for too long to good use then.
1633 2018-09-23 22:20:19 I’m not convinced that #U308 stocks would drop significantly when broader markets roll over due to amount of liquidity looking for a new bull market to be a part of. Plus, by then the #U308 bull market will be firmly established = MSM attention 
1634 2018-09-23 22:17:51 If you lost a lot of food due to the blackout, Hartman’s seems to have lots of discounted stuff so you can build your freezer stocks back up for a little cheaper.
1635 2018-09-23 22:14:35 What has more negative impact on fish stocks is over harvesting. America & some Western nation's have to abide by regulated fishing seasons while China continues to fish every day!
1636 2018-09-23 22:11:40 I did a smart move by investing into stocks that’s why I have a lot of cash lol
1637 2018-09-23 22:11:36 Abe is so much smarter than Trump.  I have no doubt there will be a deal made and Trump will think it's great for America.  That's why I buy Japanese stocks.
1638 2018-09-23 22:10:58 What you can capture in combat and at the same time buy on the international market= Russian.
Things that not normally is captured in large stocks= NATO.
1639 2018-09-23 22:10:19 Everyone is wondering whether to invest in Canadian pot stocks... consider buying Doritos stocks.

1644 2018-09-23 22:05:08 @NFLPA I could get all y'all players. Make money end your career from football less time in there. Spend less 0 money before you start your career. Invest part of your money each check. Buying a business or stocks. Come out less time moaning & groaning stating your hurt.

1646 2018-09-23 22:04:35 Are there any moderate democrats left?  They think these unhinged comments & actions by democrats on the Hill are helpful or the mainstream?!

They must realize how well things are going with economy, jobs, stocks, trade, N Korea, ISIS destroyed, seriously moderates??
1647 2018-09-23 22:02:30 Hell yes.  Just short-sale auto stocks and walk away grinning.
1648 2018-09-23 22:02:11 From what I can tell, airline, auto and housing stocks are priced as if the market thinks earnings will fall. I.e. single- or low double-digit P/Es.

Any other industries getting the same treatment?
1649 2018-09-23 22:00:02 What happened last week that caused arms industry stocks to all skyrocket?
1650 2018-09-23 21:59:05 Few more hours check ur alerts on ur stocks and stocks make sure it's all set.. dead stock make a list to get rid off
1651 2018-09-23 21:56:23 Mooners were told they will be 50K in Jan-18, 100K in Sept-18. They are already 9 months late. 9 months in crypto is 9 years in Stocks (they say). Why are you stopping them from going on a moon trip? You know I'm kidding, right?

1653 2018-09-23 21:53:12 Right now @elkwood66  is realizing the most bizarre thing he has witnessed all year is not the supernova run in pot stocks- its the fact that the #MiamiDolphins are 3-0 an on top the division #study
1654 2018-09-23 21:50:01 61% of all fishing stocks are 'fully exploited' and a further 29% are 'over exploited'. We have lost over 50% of all fishing stocks since 1970; which greatly affects marine life that depend on those species, in addition to a +0.17oC temperature rise per decade in the same period.

1656 2018-09-23 21:43:57 Why is Apple the first company to reach a trillion dollars through stocks? 
1657 2018-09-23 21:43:38 Yes, I fully agree. U price will go up although may be somewhat muted if there is a big market correction. If that happens, once markets stabilize, the U mining stocks should catch up to Spot to some degree.
1658 2018-09-23 21:42:21 Awesome video, but not enough to get me to pay anywhere near 67bp for $BJK.

"Sin stocks" have long outperformed S&P and FTSE4Good, gaming is just one sector.

Global gaming should be weighted by earnings or FCF, not mkt cap, Macau > Vegas

Very timely with the Japan legalization

1666 2018-09-23 21:33:31 Here we go again, stock market made highs, and I’m asked.. when will drop? This is a bullish question. It shows caution. At market tops, they ask.. how can I make a quick killing. DOs: regular LT indexing.. DONTs: trading, big bets, chasing hot stocks, margin, option gyms..
1667 2018-09-23 21:32:19 Ppl new to stock that chose Marijuana sector to learn, expand Ur knowledge with other stocks. Marijuana sector is so volatile it's more difficult to predict - from a noob who got in with Marijuana sector
1668 2018-09-23 21:31:58 Aside from death directly as by catch or from nets/gear etc. They are also vulnerable due the impacts of depleted fishing stocks, climate change, habitat loss and degradation, pollution and toxic spillages (oil etc.) and human activities such as military actions and whaling.
1669 2018-09-23 21:30:48 Just reduce taxes for cooperatives and increase it on big companies like Amazon and Starbucks by bringing in minimums for companies that send cash abroad. Splitting stocks and shares up is just the most overcomplicated solution.

1676 2018-09-23 21:27:39 My point is that many in the #gunlobby seem to think the 2A is sacrosanct and even the most minor #guncontrol should be opposed. I believe #assaultweapons should be banned as well as large magazines & bump-stocks. Background checks should be used for all gun purchases

1677 2018-09-23 21:26:53 This is desperation. Brazil can’t supply China’s needs and China’s stocks are running down.
1678 2018-09-23 21:25:49 Rubbish as usual from fraudster Muppet Mogg. You underestimated our negotiating position. Europe were consistent throughout & have less to lose than the UK. But don’t worry, let’s just short sterling, the FTSE 250 index and go long $ exposed 100 Index stocks & everything will ok
1679 2018-09-23 21:25:00 Funny how the stocks have now changed or reported this growth
1680 2018-09-23 21:22:48 My stock stream seemed to have dropped about 4 mins in. However, anyone interested can just take a look at the stocks in the title and do you own DD as you should always do this and never trade based on my opinion.
1681 2018-09-23 21:22:41 I love broccoli and Stilton too - although not sure I ever have any “left over blue cheese”  (reminds me of that tip to “freeze leftover wine into ice cubes for stocks/risottos etc... what’s leftover wine?!)

1683 2018-09-23 21:20:35 Investors who claim they can’t find undervalued stocks in the midst of lengthy bull markets simply aren’t looking hard enough. In my opinion, significant opportunities always exist in the inefficient, and often ignored, microcap universe. 
1684 2018-09-23 21:18:32 And is it just me or is it REALLY weird that it's in there as a function of money, when so many of the things you might be trying to differentiate money from (like say a portfolio of stocks and bonds) are so often better at projecting purchasing power into the future?

1693 2018-09-23 21:06:44 On a stocks trade i would generally agree, but crypto is not stocks so i would not base it on any chart what so ever.
1694 2018-09-23 21:06:39 Well that’s my sort of thoughts on it money starts to move from stocks to crypto that reduces the inflated stock market safely money pours into crypto from all over the world it’s like a overflow tank bringing all the shit they put out back
1695 2018-09-23 21:05:08 No problem.. Can you just at least list some of the U related stocks that you follow ? Then I will do my own research.

1716 2018-09-23 20:46:29 If u are gonna invest in pot stocks than you should also consider protecting a little of that cash. Perhaps spread your money out. Nothing better and safer than Bitcoin and Ethereum Classic. Well safe may not be the right word but in 5 years you will have made your money 5 x over

1754 2018-09-23 20:01:25 Value investing is intellectually easy, but emotionally tough. It is easy to find the unloved, low priced stocks or avoid the over priced ones. The tough part is to look like fool 80% of the time by avoiding exactly what is popular.

1762 2018-09-23 19:52:00 In crypto - the lack of authority, inability to regulate - is the very idea that was spawned. It is the ‘why’ of crypto. It’s not an amazing concept Larry that you go peddle your regulation shilling in stocks, rather than attempting to buckle down the only free market around.
1763 2018-09-23 19:51:52 Share buybacks drive equities higher. As equities go higher risky bonds, like high-yield, continue to outperform. As long as risky debt is stable, there is no comeuppance. Until stocks go down nothing changes in developed markets
1764 2018-09-23 19:51:30 Lol stocks crashed because of a democrat initiatives, Sub prime mortgages. Tarp is an acronym for the toxic assets wall street needed to be bailed out from. You have an expanded vocabulary but lack awareness on many things

1766 2018-09-23 19:49:23 Definitely, the stocks fundamentals must be intact, what you are taking advantage of is the markets reaction to the price, not the value

If bond yields stocks to provide a higher yield to compete with bonds....

1776 2018-09-23 19:35:59 These were non-interest accounts that forced depositers to buy whatever the bank offered. It was a scam to get money into stocks and to recap banks so they can lend to failing industrialists. They haven't solved any of this yet.
1777 2018-09-23 19:34:49 I just find it frustrating that people are fine with a free for all, perceived drop in a bucket or not. This generation of fish harvesters are not the ones from the 70's. We want a future, and we want stocks to build not decline.

#AAZ maiden dividend currently yields 7% strong earnings - target £1.20p
1784 2018-09-23 19:25:47 Not about tax but control of funds. These funds were forced into stocks. This is why Indians don't trust the govt who has a long history of imposing draconian capital controls.

1790 2018-09-23 19:16:42 If you haven't got the guts to run Bitcoin and take risk, then go back to fiat and day trading stocks where you belong. Bitcoin is not for you.

1793 2018-09-23 19:12:18 There was an amnesty bank account offered by the govt for undeclared cash (mostly rural) that can't be withdrawn for a few years, but it could be invested in stocks/mutual fund. These funds will eventually come out.
1794 2018-09-23 19:12:08 Sir, What about capital first, capacite infra and federal bank? Not quality stocks?
1795 2018-09-23 19:11:46 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
1796 2018-09-23 19:11:19 Valuations are much more useful for aggregates of stocks than for individual stocks so perhaps we agree there. We're probably talking about different things. But if cash flows are so great why not use them for indices too?
1797 2018-09-23 19:09:19 You mean the card UI method for displaying stock details and how it interferes with UX when switching stocks?

1800 2018-09-23 19:07:23 Haha same. When I'm bullish I just use passive ETFs for beta at lowest cost. When I'm bearish, I select robust/counter-cyclical stocks myself. I dont try to beat the market on the upside, only by having less severe draw-downs during crashes.
1801 2018-09-23 19:05:59 Open up 2-weekly or monthly charts,  yes, there are some stocks in downtrends only getting worse but you can't deny the strength few stocks ended up showing on Friday. 
P.S - $Nifty is resting on 10 ema (2-weekly charts) and still trading above on monthly charts. Let price guide.
1802 2018-09-23 19:03:10 So my question is, will any of this cause a sizable dip in the markets and create a good buying opportunity for stocks?
1803 2018-09-23 19:02:44 Most don’t own stocks and many do not have 401(k)s! Wages are not keeping pace with inflation and cost of fuel goods housing energy childcare healthcare all on the rise!
1804 2018-09-23 19:00:54 Mam fiis bought nifty and stocks in tons on Friday. Have a thought at the data as well

1. What happened to the 20+ women who accused Trump of sexual assault pre-election?  Paid off?
2. Bump Stocks?  Banned yet?
3. Who paid off Kavanaugh's debt?  Who owns him now?
4. Why won't Trump release his taxes?  Not as rich as he promotes himself being?
1809 2018-09-23 18:56:00 Talked w/ Susan Kaplan.  She's doing great. 2 investments we talked about &, per usual, agree on: 1) Cryptocurrensies r FAR too risky; don't touch under any conditions; 2) Cannabis stocks: extremely risky. only invest in if its w/ 'gambling $', which U can AFFORD 2 lose ALL of.

1815 2018-09-23 18:50:01 @tim_cook @pschiller Why not give Apple's customers a little but significant investment edge by adding the far more relevant for 'valuation at a glance' P/FCF ratio to the standard P/E ratio in Stocks?
Thanks for reading my suggestion.
1816 2018-09-23 18:48:48 Pretty disappointed in Big Gay performance lately, thinking of selling my stocks if things don't turn around soon.

It's amazing how black people can come together to make nike super xtra mo rich; if only blacks would come together in EVERYTHING concerning the black community, we could make some noise
1819 2018-09-23 18:47:50 3. Equity - this can either be called stocks (ownership certificate of any company) or shares (ownership certificate in a particular company). A shareholder is the company co-owner. If the company makes profit, a portion is paid to shareholder in the form of dividend
1820 2018-09-23 18:47:16 I'll take Munger seriously when he provides a better estimate historical returns on stocks than Siegel does.
1821 2018-09-23 18:47:09 60 day implied volatility is near a record low on $IQ options, extreme low IV tends to precede big moves in historically volatile stocks.

1827 2018-09-23 18:44:15 But would be more preferable if more Japanese citizens as private citizens owned much of those capital assets directly through a fund or something along the lines of market socialism. At least @MattBruenig thinks in that direction vs the state owning stocks on behalf of people.
1828 2018-09-23 18:43:23 Actually the list shows that there are still very few investors in U equities in Scandinavia and stable. The (new) on the list are additional U stocks I would like to start trending on.

1836 2018-09-23 18:40:20 I love Hot Money. Please try to get more people with different views on the show.

Although I never buy from recommendations, it’s nice to know what people think about stocks.
1837 2018-09-23 18:39:05 This is totally off topic   How much of the stock is in 401k index funds?  Most people disagree with obscene salaries for ceos but can’t vote their 401k holdings.  Could fund managers vote the stocks for a better balance?

1839 2018-09-23 18:36:23 The stock market is for people with money who buy, sell and trade stocks. How's rich people making money in the stock market impact a working man's wages? ALSO the economy was growing at the same rate if not faster during Obama's years. The stats are online. Truth is truth.

1894 2018-09-23 17:36:53 Yes, it keeps going down. It’s the trend that started under Obama, who for a sustained period averaged more new jobs per month than trump; growth exceeded 4.1% four times; and stocks went from 8000 to 20,000. 

And he didn’t sell America’s soul. 

Thanks Obama.

1960 2018-09-23 16:30:14 Tim Ball is a pioneer CAGW skeptic. But he confuses CO2 stocks with flows like some other skeptics. This is like confusing a balance sheet with a cash flow statement in finance. Net human CO2 emissions are at least 90% of NEW emissions, the others are annual to decadal recycling.

2001 2018-09-23 16:02:04 Over the years I've learnt that if you are a #positional #trader & u use leverage (like futures), choose LOW #volatility stocks or indices.

2002 2018-09-23 16:01:20 The minute they sense they won't be getting more money in shares, they'll pull their stocks. Stocks will plummet, and the DOW will crash so hard. Companies will close just try to to salvage what money they got. And if the employers don't have money, how do we get paid?

2069 2018-09-23 14:58:13 Most of those age folks remember the promises of confederation. 
They also remember how the Fed gov mismanaged the fish stocks for the benefit of trade deals for upper Canada.
Also how other natural resources were pillaged without much benefit to them. 
I understand their point.

2074 2018-09-23 14:52:59 People who cannot digest moves of small cap stocks shd stick to large caps.

Understand your gut and invest

Ppl want small cap returns and large cap drawdowns.

Typical retail mentality that is doomed.

Yeah, I imagined it would be similar to the Assassin's Festival, but a renaissance faire instead~ Gladio would be indifferent towards the whole thing, so 'king' of the renfaire Noctis would accuse Gladio of a fake crime and have him put in the laughing stocks!

2079 2018-09-23 14:50:45 @porinju why your recommended stocks like HCL info, GVK and allcargo falling heavily it's almost halved from time you spoke about these businesses. Do you still recommend these businesses  as they are available at 50% discount to your price of recommendation

2081 2018-09-23 14:49:38 I don’t know much about stocks. 

I just know that I use market for everything I list on TCG. If I can’t use the market price I simply don’t list it on TCG.

Also, if you factor market in when buying then you still keep your margins in check when selling at market.

Inference: Medium term bottom has been formed . Nifty will be in trading range now .

2122 2018-09-23 14:16:17 Beans posted small gains over the past two weeks. USDA’s Sept report hiked production/demand more than expected, making report neutral. Demand is the big concern as trade wars continue. Production looks to increase along with stocks, which are at record. Can this trend continue?

That's why you can't list the spending programs created by Obama that cost that money.

It was leftover unfunded spending programs from Bush. 

Stocks could have continued the Republican collapse, OBAMA stopped the recession becoming a depression.

2173 2018-09-23 13:31:32 The notional salary of AT&T CEO is 366x the salary of their lowest-paid employee. Most CEOs are mostly paid in stocks of some form, though, so this doesn't even give the whole picture of inequality. For a reference point, Mondragon Cooperative recommends no more than a 6:1 ratio.

2182 2018-09-23 13:25:16 I understand & would agree with you but the reason I & many Americans are against further restrictions/regs is that those who want them will never be satisfied.

2193 2018-09-23 13:15:44 You must have been in a coma for 8 years. Under Obama, stocks rose from under 7,000 to almost 20,000 (without tax cuts so corps. could buy back their stock), unemployment from over 10% to almost 4%. Greater number of jobs created than Trump in same time period. Research.

2198 2018-09-23 13:11:22 People who own stocks on corporations did very good... but how about teachers, military personnel, restaurant employees, store employees that do not receive stock compensation?

2206 2018-09-23 12:59:25 Uganda is endowed with river systems. almost every kilometer in some regions there is a river. Can UG use these river systems to increase fish stocks by building embankments to create natural dams? 

How many micro /medium Dam construction engineers do we have?!
2207 2018-09-23 12:59:01 Mutual funds cannot be blindly trusted like you say. Most funds do not outperform the benchmark indices. Then what the hell do they charge the exorbitant management fees for. People are better off investing directly in good quality stocks for better returns without the fees.

2240 2018-09-23 12:25:22 The transfers from the BSPS 2 are in fact late transfers from the BSPS 1.

2297 2018-09-23 11:32:33 Some fund managers advocate concentrated bets only in 10 stocks as they manage other people's money rather than their own money. Concentrated bets with low margin of safety can wipe off what you earned in 5 years in just one month. Look at what happened to DHFL, Yes bank

2307 2018-09-23 11:17:28 C even a 500 pts downfall in nifty may create a panic nd stocks may fall by 15-20% nd even more..

2311 2018-09-23 11:16:13 On a more positive note. Today's awesome thing of the day is penny stocks. What are they & where do to them? Do some Google-fu & if you want to start to saving & investing with low risk & cost that's a great place to start. Aid small company to 1ups & enjoy good returns. Yay!
2312 2018-09-23 11:15:38 I am imagining what $DOL would have been if the company used $3B worth of stock buybacks over last 6 years towards opening stores and making acquisitions.

Another question would be instead buying back shares all the time what if $DOL bought back stocks when it had bad quarters?
2313 2018-09-23 11:15:24 Chinese Internet stocks - another place where lots of people got badly burnt this year. The sector from hot craze in 2017 has turned out to be toxic investment in 2018

2318 2018-09-23 11:10:44 Well, it makes up about 10% of my overall portfolio, which is split across individual dividend stocks, large and small cap index funds, various bonds, and a few REITS. So it's part of a balanced portfolio, and hedges against the risks of an overall market downturn.

2321 2018-09-23 11:09:45 Gold stocks generally, perhaps commodity stocks have struggled to reflect value. Look at ASO or ARS or HZM or AAU or CAML or SML. Perhaps that will start to change in Q4.  But outside this sector feel good about SOS.
2322 2018-09-23 11:08:51 Sometimes no matter how much conviction you have - your investment can break your heart in a big way. 2018 is turning out to be extremely disappointing year for Social media stocks Facebook and Twitter.

2374 2018-09-23 09:48:11 On the flip side of that it allowed small retail investors an opportunity to capitalise on high volatility/high profit markets. Loss of $ value is easily reclaimed with increased btc value. Alts will be used to build btc $ value will come on next wave. This is not stocks.

2378 2018-09-23 09:42:15 Have use ESignal before too ... could only justify it for day trading but that’s not my style ... Also used TradeStation for back testing strategies .... but to be honest ...

I would choose FMCG stocks for Long-term investing over Mutual Funds
#FMCGSTOCKS in Long run can give great returns if you accumulate on good dips. Time & Price is key to make bigger returns

2468 2018-09-23 08:41:12 A common character of a global trust/fund is to invest in large stocks in a few developed markets. The trust I am investing in is higher risk, single country & niche within that country. It is unproven, but with the potential, though not the promise of greater reward.

2479 2018-09-23 08:29:32 Stocks saw some renewed buying with S&P making new highs. This was due to USD weakness, limited impact of trade tariffs, and portfolio flows into US markets vs others. But this is the tail end of these flows and any further increases will be limited.

2513 2018-09-23 07:59:11 Policy should always be sensitive to the plight of citizens. Denying anyone their source of livelihood is denying them the right to live. Stocks were confiscated or destroyed. No amount of orderliness justifies denying someone their source of livelihood!

2534 2018-09-23 07:32:22 Do you think that there are sufficient rents from ownership of capital that taxing it would create the incentives for more productivity growth than the current approach?

2547 2018-09-23 07:20:30 Sir, buying at high valuations is always a matter of concern,when to buy is always a big question,my strategy is to buy  fundamentally and technically good stocks at all prices,if there is a fall then buy more quantity.Less quantity in high valuations & adding more in correction
2548 2018-09-23 07:20:15 Grigg stocks on the rise, surely Mitch deserves a 2nd crack at it now

2557 2018-09-23 07:15:37 Last thing before I go to bed (cause I have been up way too long) is watch reports on global food stocks.  We are entering a solar minimum and that is what is REALLY effecting the weather.  Food stocks are way down, my advice is if you aren't prepping, START ASAP.
2558 2018-09-23 07:13:58 Take less risk. And less greedy.  Long term. Have a basket of real estate, bullion, bank savings, stocks. Spend less. When an it major started retrenchment, staff cried saying our debts are huge

2564 2018-09-23 07:10:43 but you have less stocks to do it with, so you need to do even better on each remaining stock (1.5 across 2 stocks rather than 1.33 across 3)
2565 2018-09-23 07:08:50 It's the basic construct of the MF industry. NAV of a fund can only be calculated after the price of stocks/debentures that a fund holds is finalized i.e. after market closure(3:30pm) + reconciliation of incoming money, AMC expense calculations etc. Hence only EOD allotments.

2568 2018-09-23 07:05:58 @markminervini 
Hi Mark, one question: To filter stocks you can use @MarketSmith but what are you using to detect breakouts automatically? Is there a chance to use the IBD criteria/values combined with code in a trading software to minimize screen time or is this essential for U?
2569 2018-09-23 07:05:56 yung sa book din noon ganyan hinohoard kahit nung mismong book launch event hinold stocks nagintay kami ng matagal kasi sabi out of stock na daw yun pala tinago lang looks like may bibili nun pinareserved na eh ayaw umalis ng mga tao sa pila ng mga tao so napilitan sila ibenta

2575 2018-09-23 06:55:17 Guys, if there are no more stocks at SM North, tawid lang kayo papuntang Trinoma, dyan sa The Block malapit yung bridge going to Trinoma. Medyo maliit lang kasi yung stall/kiosk ng MAC dun, kaya siguro hindi puntahin ng tao.

2576 2018-09-23 06:52:57 You can identify stocks you want to pick and spread them over 3 tranches. Usually 30:30:40 is a good bet. Buy 30% when markets correct, buy another 30% post another correction and the remainder when they fall another 10%. This is just so that you don't get FOMO.
2577 2018-09-23 06:52:36 Yung mga naghahanap ng bts albums, sa Cubao madami pa stocks

2581 2018-09-23 06:51:01 If you are buying for 5+ years, you can pick large good quality stocks. You can never be wrong with them in the long run however if you are not doing your research and studying businesses, stock market isn't for you.

2585 2018-09-23 06:48:04 Bump stocks are a gimmick and not required to bump fire. “Silencers” which are actually suppressors are a legitimate device for hearing protection.

2611 2018-09-23 06:24:02 You are never going to get rid of banks. Do you realise what else goes on in them? So stocks and shares would be gone? No more loans /mortgages for people? Etc etc. how many millions of people would become unemployed? Income tax massively decreased so no money to run the world?
2612 2018-09-23 06:21:10 For few stocks on charts it looks like price took support on very far ma in monthly and weekly charts but everything happened in few minutes.
2613 2018-09-23 06:20:41 Just want to understand TA. Should we really consider this as gap filled as it's a black Swan event in Indian markets and most of the stocks behaved same way leaving big wicks.
2614 2018-09-23 06:19:22 Don't know the outfall of this, but it may not be good.

China is one of many countries whose central banks have been creating currency, devaluing it, to buy FANG stocks in the US market. They can probably absorb it, but many emerging markets are struggling.

2619 2018-09-23 06:14:04 Yea pot is insane right now. I just started playing around trading stocks in a “play” account i set up. I made 145% profit on 1st trade in $TLRY trade last week (got out Wednesday morning). It’s about to be legal there in just a few weeks. Most of what i have are in that space.

2634 2018-09-23 05:52:01 LIE. But then again no beginning/end dates. The S&P 500 is up only 9.94% for 2018. 2017 was 21%. You inherited booming economy & under u everything's sinking. 2013 under Obama 32%! Walmart/Target begging u to remove tariffs. Prices going UP. Stocks will continue down. Deficit UP.

2673 2018-09-23 05:09:25 True. Markets have surprised  many  times by going up when everything was pointing south. But in hindsight it is clear that the indices were being managed through hardly 10 stocks just to keep the mood high and inflows intact. Midcaps collapsed long back n portfolios bleeding n/1
2674 2018-09-23 05:09:04 I can see you’re completely new to this. Welcome to the stock market, where ALL stocks go up AND down! Dunno what you expected. It’s also clear you aren’t a trader. I hope you’re following me to actually LEARN instead of being a puppet & following the actions of other haters

2684 2018-09-23 05:01:23 All of above - if you follow a simple law in trade or investment - buy down sell high - sell on high buy down - this will be true in every segment whether BTST / SHORT / LONG / MEDIUM / F N O ! The key is spotting the High / Low in all analysis whether Fundamental / Technicals !

Stock available at 370-380. 1 of the best stocks in the Sector. Q1 not great but Q2 will be good, accumulate at current levels.

Stock available at 200-220.Worst stock in the sector. Dump it & move to the leader in the sector.

2738 2018-09-23 04:07:31 So how are we going to replace all of the corporate tax money? Corporations are clearly just using it to buy back stocks from the public to make their pockets fatter. Steroids eventually wear off.
2739 2018-09-23 04:07:10 @NSEIndia needs to broadbase this index. For a weekly index it has far less number of stocks.

2769 2018-09-23 03:42:39 Equity  investors earn more than cash dividends. At a P/E of 18x, the earnings yield (E/P) is 5.5%. The 10 year is 3.1%. That’s a 2.4%/year advantage for stocks. Is that enough? Most of the time, yes.

2810 2018-09-23 03:05:35 Well frankly there should be a few match races. Force against Force. Courtney vs Brittany first both in top fuel cars, then both in funny cars.  Maybe 2 races in each switching lanes If there is a tie, borrow a couple of pro stocks. Sound good?
2811 2018-09-23 03:04:10 Despite the TLRY crash, coming into next week all I feel like doing is buying more weed stocks. There are still so many major catalysts on the horizon. The main one being full US legalization of adult recreational use.

2823 2018-09-23 02:51:47 Swinging shorts is a bit risky with these POS stocks. I'm expecting a bit of a pop at the open if premarket continues the aftermarket trend, but I also see it sliding down towards the end of the day, possibly going red. Like with $NBEV

2836 2018-09-23 02:37:08 Sure we do.  Tokens are better than stocks in countless ways.  Traceable.  Infinitely divisible.  Able to be swapped for other stocks without first cashing to fiat.  Every company’s equity stakes should absolutely be tokenized.
2837 2018-09-23 02:36:41 I laughed at bump stocks used with tripods! 
That would never work, they counteract each other
.. lol
2838 2018-09-23 02:35:06 I think when the stocks drop or waiver just because of a possible talks of losing money, someone is buying shares when they start to drop by waiting,than buy it before it may start to easy back up. Someone is making money

2841 2018-09-23 02:33:03 Totally agree. #Traditionalmarkets, primarily #fiat, #stocks & #gold, are about to tank harder than ever before. Millenials will flock to $btc. Governments will topple in the years to follow. Anyone that late to #crypto will bear the largest burden.

2849 2018-09-23 02:28:54 I’d like to know what’s up with all the hooting and hollering about Nike stocks crashing after the new Kapernick campaign when in reality they’re up? Only $2. and change since August but they’re up not down. Very disappointing to realize I have to fact check. I should know better

2852 2018-09-23 02:28:01 Honestly don't know which stocks to pick and manage, right now it's easier to buy funds in an app

2863 2018-09-23 02:22:43 I own several AR-15s and shoot them often, but thanks for the tip. I have no experience with bump stocks, nor do I have any interest in owning them, but that’s irrelevant to my question specific to the Vegas killer. All reports I’ve heard said he had multiples.
2864 2018-09-23 02:20:23 What are some hot stocks to watch
2865 2018-09-23 02:20:20 You’ve been trading for around 20 years right? At what point  did you decide to start trading the handful of stocks you stick with?
2866 2018-09-23 02:19:41 Which stocks are those?
2867 2018-09-23 02:19:17 I NEED TO TALK TO SOMEONE THAT KNOWS STOCKS.
2868 2018-09-23 02:18:36 In the end I think it would be. If you start with the position I started with it's $15/hr and they encourage overtime. You get stocks in the company for free and everyone who does a good job is supposed to get a bonus every year.
2869 2018-09-23 02:18:03 If i may add. 1 needs to exit losers before an year and winners after an year to benefit from taxation. The minimum time needed 2 c results is between 3 and 5 years. Each stock to be held for 1 year and stocks rotated. Correct me if am wrong

2875 2018-09-23 02:10:49 obvious rebalancing pressures last week out of growth and u.s. and into international and value. t'was overdue and the charts foretold it. how any investor doesn't use technical analysis is beyond me. #stocks
2876 2018-09-23 02:10:46 No promoter in Indian runs business with his own money after 5 years of business. You will amazed at the level of trickery if you look closely at some of market's favorite stocks. One example is Venky's. Do check how much net worth is outside the company with promoters.
2877 2018-09-23 02:07:15 no reason trading index when stocks are in primary trend (up or down). that's always my philosophy.

2890 2018-09-23 01:57:52 Please let us know who your broker is. Most money managers tell us to be balanced between stocks and bonds. Stocks diversified including global and emerging markets. Most are not concentrated in #FANGS and  so their returns are very moderate
2891 2018-09-23 01:57:32 The halt killed the momentum of the ipo.  28000 buys and 21000 sells and they halt for imbalance of orders.  That's how all stocks go up or down, imbalance of orders!!!

2911 2018-09-23 01:27:34 XRP gap move makes BTC holders think harder about crystallizing losses. It is time to remember 2008. A lot of people thought the 2008 crisis was averted when Bear Stearns fell in Mar of 2008. The XRP rally could be a bull trap just as the Bear relief rally in stocks was in 2008.

2928 2018-09-23 01:07:27 And I'm not talking about stocks only, but investing in a personal business, start up (which is what many of these can best be compared to), the higher the risk the higher the potential reward, but you should already know that going in.
2929 2018-09-23 01:06:53 The left loves Islam, for now, so they won't criticize it for any reason.

2948 2018-09-23 00:45:59 That’s not fair. When Nike release the Ad There was a call for national boycott and stocks initially went down. To say they only did it to make money is true but misleading. All marketing ads are made to make money for the corporation.  That is what Marketing Purpose is.
2949 2018-09-23 00:45:19 That's simply not true. Publicly traded stocks, for instance, are an order of magnitude more transparent than your average cryptocurrency team. 
Compare #Ripple with Walmart, for instance.

2958 2018-09-23 00:33:23 I invested in some stocks just outta curiosity, and did not expect it to pay off like that. 
2959 2018-09-23 00:30:34 Yep. You can barrack for Collingwood or Melbourne but investing is not football. The greatest enemy of investors is feeling they are part of some kind of club. The next is bagging other stocks which actually damages their own with negativity. If you're confident you don't need it
2960 2018-09-23 00:28:45 Do the majority of the American people have stocks or have enough money to put in a 401K or even have a 401K? Did they see any raise in their paychecks? I think not.
2961 2018-09-23 00:27:43 It is dumber shorting stocks during one of the most long lasting bull market in history (IMHO)

2964 2018-09-23 00:23:00 Replace was a lie. They had no intention of replacing anything. Only investing more personal money in Cemetery Stocks & Crematoriums. Somebody should look into that, yes?
2965 2018-09-23 00:22:37 @jonathani501 Let me guess .. you didn't chase the cannabis stocks ?
2966 2018-09-23 00:20:46 42% of the S&P 500’s total returns come from dividends. If you’re looking to build wealth or generate income, dividend stocks are pretty hard to beat. DO IT WITH AN INDEX MUTUAL FUND

2968 2018-09-23 00:19:40 Will we see a hand-off in next fiscal year to weak dollar winners--precious metals, commodities, emerging markets, US exporters? Will next yrs big stocks again be US QQQ type stuff? In 2007, QQQ peaked early Oct.
2969 2018-09-23 00:18:56 we definitely don't have any stocks of that
2970 2018-09-23 00:17:25 I agree Brad. Back in 2015 we started putting a few hours a day into research. The truth is that in a general sense anyone can research. What I think is sad is that people are willing to spend money on stocks without knowledge. Like running a business u know nothing about.

3026 2018-09-21 23:42:30 If you look at the info it all points to big things in the not to distant future. Price is dropping because people don’t regularly hold OTC stocks long and your seeing impatient people selling so they can play the daytrader game. IMO $CELZ is worth the wait

3065 2018-09-21 23:11:23 i would love to speculate on pot stocks but there are so few it makes me a bit nervous about liquidity. seems even riskier than crypto right now.
3066 2018-09-21 23:10:45 more than a majority of stocks, bonds & commods
3067 2018-09-21 23:08:19 do you do regular stocks
3068 2018-09-21 23:08:18 If you have money in stock market and you anticipate Dems taking Congress, you need to sell your stocks now. A Democratic win will result in a huge crash in the stock market. Your 401k plan will be damaged severely by Democratic win.

3070 2018-09-21 23:08:02 It's nature stocks and shit, simple
3071 2018-09-21 23:07:49 Is this like @SpeakerRyan ‘s $0.25 saved from the tax reform bill? The answer is yes. The stocks will fall and the interest rates will rise. The young people are benefitting because we are awesome. finally getting out from under the baby boomers, being creative & entrepreneurial.
3072 2018-09-21 23:04:58 It would be nice if there were no tax on dividends because the tax system encourages companies to do buy-backs instead of dividends. It would be healthier if companies were routinely expected to pay shareholders a dividend. Instead people think stocks are only for cap gains.

3075 2018-09-21 23:02:44 All my buddies from the military bc they believe I’m actually smart. I’m always long term though, in truth. High yield stocks. High tech, resilient tech #crypto. I made my mistakes early. Own about 40 bags of shit coins. To prove it, but hey, I own them!
3076 2018-09-21 23:02:15 This is shocking. Even Waitrose stocks it.
3077 2018-09-21 22:59:59 The main reason why I lost the set was because the set up had delay and I SD'd 2 of my stocks in different games.
3078 2018-09-21 22:59:44 Trump talks about helping vets, in reality he has done nothing. The billions he is providing, will go to private clinics that contributed to his campaign. 
He may even own those clinic stocks.

3080 2018-09-21 22:58:09 Stock prices only matter to those who can afford to own stocks.  Take a look at the bottom of your shoes and you'll notice 99% of the population who are not billionaires.  Eighty percent live paycheck to paycheck and stock prices don't mean anything to their bottom line.

3087 2018-09-21 22:52:48 None of which have actually happened,  except stocks. But guess what, Wall Street gains don't help Main Street jobs or wages. Employment gains mostly in.low pay - low benefit jobs and real wages flat. So, at least get your facts straight
3088 2018-09-21 22:52:48 Weed stocks took a fucking hit today and so did my profit.

Bitch
3089 2018-09-21 22:52:01 I don’t promote my stock club like that but I am noticing that by the time you guys are noticing these stocks we are already in and out the stock. Remember you have to catch it before it pops. One of the things that help me was staying off of social media during trading hours
3090 2018-09-21 22:49:00 There should be ban on advising stocks by any tv channel also.

3094 2018-09-21 22:44:10 Im going by Finviz as well for the listed SS & im a theory trader which means in certain stocks I believe if the variables or share structures doesnt change in certain ones they can only go so low before traders pounce, the only thing a low floater truly needs to move is > Volume
3095 2018-09-21 22:41:57 I’m trying to learn as much as I can. Rn I got my money going into an IRA where someone does my stocks for me but if I could learn myself that would be amazing
3096 2018-09-21 22:41:40 alot of bs low float stocks went parabolic today
3097 2018-09-21 22:41:35 ...how high was i when i bought them or how high have the stocks gone? 
3098 2018-09-21 22:39:54 Stocks like $NBEV - thanks but no thanks.  You’re asking to get the bone
3099 2018-09-21 22:39:06 Long term, bad projects will always die, but their current market cap (far from their real value) has nothing to do with an overall bull or bear market trend. It just means they've got a lot of people fooled. (This has happened with stocks for years at a time.)
3100 2018-09-21 22:38:13 Overheard in the office today: 
“I don’t know how to buy stocks anymore than I know how to buy drugs.”
3101 2018-09-21 22:38:05 When your stocks finally dropped at work. That’s a nice added bonus to my paycheck.

3106 2018-09-21 22:36:25 You make no sense. Stocks get listed all the time when they are clearly a scam.

3111 2018-09-21 22:33:09 Pot stocks are a good buy now. Remember I sold TLRY at $144 before the crash. Now buying CRON & TLRY.  Just trying to help.
3112 2018-09-21 22:31:56 Never seen them this week all year. Tired stocks
3113 2018-09-21 22:31:48 It's a good theory but you forget about greed.

Companies have not reinvested like they said they would, they bought back stocks and gave out one time bonuses that their employees will never see again, hence why wages have not gone up.
3114 2018-09-21 22:30:40 Duuuude I used snake too at the Nintendo E3 2018 and was nostalgic!, I see you are man of culture. This is just so beautiful men I hope you get better and beat that cancer with 3 stocks!, seriously thanks for posting this :,) . All the love for you and your friends

"There were predictions that the Dow would become equal in price to an ounce of gold, implying something like stocks falling 90% or gold increasing 10-fold.

Or that oil would reach $300 dollars a barrel.

There are always, and will always be, quacks"

3164 2018-09-21 21:52:59 Why did @SenFeinstein sit on this till the week b4,why did she not bring it up in the 1/1 meeting. Why do you think this will work? Dems vote no. We know this. At this point, What difference does it make?! #TakeTheVote.

3167 2018-09-21 21:50:49 Buy stocks
3168 2018-09-21 21:50:43 Probably because large cap stocks are catching up (finally). Dow making new highs at last

3171 2018-09-21 21:49:44 @OptionsAction why do some stocks have weekly options and others don’t .

3174 2018-09-21 21:48:09 Speculators play the market and so did the Scheftels company, but never against its own stocks. Speculators, however, buy mining shares outright or on margin because they want to gamble. The Scheftels company played the market for just the opposite reason. #GGRadventures

3183 2018-09-21 21:40:27 XRP gap move makes BTC holders think harder about taking gains. It is time to remember that a lot of people thought the 2008 crisis ended when Bear Stearns was sold in Mar of 2008. The rally in XRP could be a bull trap just as the Bear relief rally in stocks was in 2008.
3184 2018-09-21 21:39:47 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
3185 2018-09-21 21:39:13 when governments cut budgets, money leaves the economy and creates deflation, there are no incentives for employers to raise wages, hire more staff or invest in capital, corporations buy back stocks, pay dividends & pay bonuses which don't end up in the economy
3186 2018-09-21 21:37:39 The jobless owning a record low of stocks is at a record high, @realDonaldTrump?
3187 2018-09-21 21:35:09 Dow notches record high and best week in two months. S&P 500 inches lower. Nasdaq loses 0.5% as tech stocks dip. Twitter slides nearly 5%, while Micron drops 3%. BU-58FR
3188 2018-09-21 21:34:55 No, of course it's not a loss in absolute terms - rather it's a missed opportunity by them. And if they had put at least something into that first offering to show support there likely would have been less dilution to $VKTX.  No real difference to me - I owned both stocks.

3195 2018-09-21 21:32:49 It's hard to define. In fact not sure I even like this defn anymore. What I was trying to get at is that there will primarily be a single blockchain, but there will still be value held in other things like stocks, bonds, etc. Those would likely be secured on the same blockchain.

3198 2018-09-21 21:32:26 $SQ @cashapp adding investment services like buying stocks/bonds would be a natural fit. Stocks, bonds, bitcoin, cash, wages, payments, Visa, debit.. and maybe mortgages? The app is a literal one stop financial shop.

3201 2018-09-21 21:27:03 LOL, re: $TWTR I suspect the "price is truth" folks are mostly stopped out, gone and/or going short.  Thus the strong hands can set up the next big run.  Stocks move when they move, not how/when the masses want them to.  That's a lesson I preach constantly.
3202 2018-09-21 21:27:00 Short GAIN in USA Technologies $USAT now 43% since our SELL SHORT indicator 3 wks ago - is one of our 150+ focus stocks but not currently listed in our weekly newsletters - a missed opportunity.

3225 2018-09-21 21:14:22 CFTC still comes under the SEC regulations in the US because it deals in derivatives.

3229 2018-09-21 21:13:00 Yes, an IRA, but I don't hold individual stocks in it. It's a typical diversified stock/bond fund portfolio. My wife has a 401k with Fidelity target retirement funds, too. I'm not allowed to touch either one for trading... that decision was made 20+ years ago. :-/
3230 2018-09-21 21:13:00 Yep, I get that it gets invested, but as I said that only  benefits those who hoarded it in the first place. Money in stocks, bonds or banking is money not being spent on useful things such as healthcare, education or infrastructure in general.

3270 2018-09-21 20:57:21 Please don’t buy into pump and dump stocks... study and do your own DD before investing. This “game” is not an easy one. Study, learn, paper trade until you get a proven system then invest only what you are willing to lose. GL
3271 2018-09-21 20:57:06 But traders are not online bragging about small gains every week either. We want to be applauded for anything these days when stocks/bonds should be long term instruments and not used for pats on the back for doubling $25

3312 2018-09-21 20:30:32 I'm predicting these things mostly on the Patreon.

3314 2018-09-21 20:30:20 Only invest what you can afford to loose, it's wise to invest what you know and think long term. If you want stocks go for an index fund. Try to keep investment away from friends and family as money can ruin many things easily.

3375 2018-09-21 20:00:26 Why are tech stocks selling off today? China tariffs are only 10% now and don't go up to 25% until January 1.
3376 2018-09-21 20:00:24 Except that's what they're doing, printing money, giving it to corporations through tax breaks who then turn around and buy back stocks, inflating asset prices and not actually using any of it to invest in business growth/wages, its all about greed...
3377 2018-09-21 19:59:45 Wow... so much stocks are running eod! Big buyers before the bell always looks as a bullish signal for next week!

3385 2018-09-21 19:57:26 The corporate tax rate helps big businesses more than small, as they make far more money and can buy back stocks with the money earned from cuts. They have not invested the money nor paid workers any more.

And the average family did not get that money.

3400 2018-09-21 19:45:37 The stock market reached new records under Obama....and also, I like how you think stock prices automatically indicate how people are faring in the economy when it only shows how people who are rich enough to own stocks are doing.
3401 2018-09-21 19:44:20 But the fee difference is about the same as the performance difference. It's just a way of getting higher precision pricing on stocks that need a narrower tick size.

3469 2018-09-21 19:04:42 Think I get the "why" rationale part of your post, but not necessarily the "what" or "how." Would an example of be "5-10 stocks in daily rev strats"? Or ?? Could you pls provide an example of such a universe?
3470 2018-09-21 19:04:25 Isnt that the case with all stocks?
3471 2018-09-21 19:03:24 Well put. Relative to stocks, we’re dealing with a thinly traded market so it wouldn’t take much to cause shorts to scramble, fomo and hype in general to pump a coin. This guy is a joke. Take the garbage that whatever school taught you about markets and forget it.
3472 2018-09-21 19:03:24 Clearly don’t know how stocks work, also the average American isn’t playing the stock market so my guess is that commercial isn’t the reason for the uptick. This is one of those tweets later should be deleted because it’s so wrong.
3473 2018-09-21 19:02:41 One of the stock market's biggest problems is how a handful of technology stocks continue to gobble up more of the market. Tech has grown to be roughly 26 percent of the S&P 500...1/2

3486 2018-09-21 18:57:27 Even w/o higher returns from non-US stocks, you get a diversification benefit. I looked at a naive equal-weighted portfolio of US, int', and EM stocks split evenly between large, value, and small (11.1% each). The rebalanced portfolio earned 8.7%, the average of the funds = 8.1%.
3487 2018-09-21 18:56:47 Good, because they aren’t tech stocks.

3490 2018-09-21 18:54:21 You guys (all TV analysts) are such a joke. When I started investing in stocks back in 2006, I was watching all news channels and was mostly misguided by them.

3494 2018-09-21 18:51:51 I live in NW Florida. I totally understand. What these people don't get is, when someone stocks up for a storm, they plan for a few days, not weeks. Supplies don't last forever. Use all of the resources you can get.

This month USDA is at 1.78 bln bu. and today corn is at 3.5775. I guess cash bears don't understand historical S:U for valuation. Futures are recognizing value.

3577 2018-09-21 18:12:55 Will finding one day loss tell you overall how "green" they are? Block lies in "keen to know," an infatuation. Be keen to know their overall system.

3580 2018-09-21 18:09:55 Canadians can be asked by US Border officials if they have invested in #cannabis stocks when crossing the border. How is this legal? How is a stock portfolio germane to entry? This is some major bullshit right here.

3589 2018-09-21 18:05:25 Remember talking to a client on the phone after the big tech supernova, said he might be interested in stocks again if NQ came back to 1500 ... Good times. I would buy 1500 lol.

3596 2018-09-21 18:01:59 The biggest lesson from history is that we don't lear anything from it. Few examples of our poor learning :
1. Blindly taking calls form others
2. Following other's strategies
3. Not paying heed to SL's
4. Buying 'interesting' Stocks
5. Finally, following analysts from my firm

3599 2018-09-21 17:59:22 Cheaper stocks and lower interest rates = invest more. Expensive stocks and higher interest rates = put more towards mortgage. But always keep it a hybrid strategy IMO

3604 2018-09-21 17:56:11 Making bump stocks illegal would have reduced the carnage in Nevada.  DJT agreed to make them illegal, but it would seem politicians are dragging their feet on this.

3606 2018-09-21 17:55:37 While the Dow is making headlines and new highs, the NASDAQ (and many individual stocks) have lagged. This may change in coming days, but in the meantime, I've been nailing down profits into strength waiting patiently with my remaining cash while better entry points develop.
3607 2018-09-21 17:55:09 Ya violent moves across so many stocks today... These types of days tests our patience..

3615 2018-09-21 17:49:22 @ravi_mehata ji, situation now seems similar to 2008, many stocks which were down in 2008 are now up many folds.. any suggestions for long term invested ? Your best bets ?
3616 2018-09-21 17:48:35 It's a little different to normal trades and stocks, this "stock" will be uaed and pump its own vol... if that makes sense.

3628 2018-09-21 17:44:16 The majority of people don’t own stocks. Tariffs killing the family farmer, destroying the environment, destroying education & not protecting our kids, putting babies in jail, abusing women, increasing all costs of healthcare, making sure that billionaires run the government...
3629 2018-09-21 17:44:02 More the better. 
I don’t think there are many stocks like HDIL you can look at and claim these kinds of returns with hardly a 20-30 percent downside.
3630 2018-09-21 17:43:33 Because your "best economy" isn't actually any good for the working class & poor.

Stocks and GDP mean nothing to someone working 2 jobs just to make ends meet.
3631 2018-09-21 17:43:20 Why do advisors push the idea that women need to invest in portfolios built to satisfy the emotional side of women?Stocks and bonds are not gender specific.I invest for my personal goals-which is for my independence in retirement, not to say I'm part of a tribe.#lifegoal#invest

3642 2018-09-21 17:37:34 Disagree. People bought the news and other rode that wave. Regulation has nothing to do with it. Its the same in stocks. Stop trying to regulate crytpo - decentralize

3646 2018-09-21 17:36:25 I agree ..

3650 2018-09-21 17:33:27 I oppose bump stocks on semi auto rifles because they allow for much faster rapid fire. I don't know any civilian hunters who need to pump mass quantities of lead into a deer.  It would be naive to think that bump stocks are for anything other than the rapid shooting of humans.
3651 2018-09-21 17:33:24 It’s call inflation, Donny.  You like what it does to stocks, but ignore what it does to the price of dishwashers.

3655 2018-09-21 17:31:51 Yes... retail investors should be tought to look at portfolio and not at individual stocks. This awareness has to be brought by advisors.
3656 2018-09-21 17:31:26 It has standard deviation of 19 percent hence volatile as hell.. Only sundaram small cap is more volatile. Deals in truly trash stocks and TRADES in them with turnover of 220%.

3663 2018-09-21 17:28:51 Currently down by so much in stocks but watch I double that value in profit by the end of the month.
3664 2018-09-21 17:28:50 Does it matter that these companies are bringing this money back if it's only going to buy back stocks?

What's the "too much money chasing too few stocks" ratio these days?
3667 2018-09-21 17:27:07 Went to 2 different @KFCSA and was told there were no dunked wings, both of which open until 9pm on Fridays. One of the cashiers even told me hard luck. Wasn’t aware it was while stocks last, I’m so naar

3670 2018-09-21 17:26:11 The money I invested in John Deere and Disney did not bring jobs to CT. They merely redistributed the virtual assets from one portfolio to another. Although I suppose you could argue that I freed assets for someone else to purchase newly minted stocks to help raise capital.

3693 2018-09-21 17:16:35 @jimcramer confused about your stance on cannibis stocks? buy? Dont buy? Buy only Canopy? Nbev I think is a great stock that can help a lot of people but its being "tarred" with the negative cannibis reaction today
3694 2018-09-21 17:16:28 Are there still stocks for small sizes?
3695 2018-09-21 17:15:43 You want stocks picks that go up 100-1000%++++  follow me.. #XRP is not a crypto its a security and for Ben to say inaccurate shit on his video increases the ignorance.  So if you want to make fiat to invest in #BTC #LTC then trade stocks at least that doesn't hurt the movement.
3696 2018-09-21 17:15:33 If options are not properly priced, OTM calls will bring great money, if options are over priced, OTM will get killed right away.  Most of AOT trades are for common stocks, only some can play options (ie: apple). (2/2)
3697 2018-09-21 17:15:27 Clear as bell. Full time fell. Part time grew a little and stayed steady. One thing we’re both forgetting is the GDP. The second Trump won, the stocks went crazy.

3704 2018-09-21 17:11:42 What spooked the broader market though? The collapse seemed secular, but not secular enough at the same time... Also fall in most stocks was not in very high volumes... Some algo got triggered?
3705 2018-09-21 17:11:11 Stocks are continuing their run in Green, as DOW & S&P continue to reach new highs.  MBS is currently unchanged from yesterday's finish; and Yields dropped to 3.07%.  Otherwise, a rather quiet news day.

3716 2018-09-21 17:06:16 Sir, I am a small investor, at this point I have decided to remain calm,  invested, and have advised my Uncle to remain invested.  If any good stocks falls, then good time buy at lower prices in such bear market.

Now you know.

Cigarettes, alcohol, beverages all make huge profits!
3739 2018-09-21 16:58:20 I think not all assets relocation can be completed before this reclassification. It’s indeed kind of expectation, I’ll keep monitoring these stocks next several weeks.
3740 2018-09-21 16:58:10 I was trading Aurora Cannabis on Robinhood. Unfortunately I am now frozen out. I'm looking at marijuana stocks as a long-term hold. Advancements in medical technologies and changes in legalism will make it the stock of the future. Love your show!
3741 2018-09-21 16:57:32 Sir jiya is a very small microcap, and trading volumes are very less on daily basis, and the charts I apply are ichimoku and ichimoku charts are accurate only in indices or stocks with high volumes.

3748 2018-09-21 16:54:56 On guns - "Universal background checks to make sure people who have access to guns will be responsible gun owners, banning bump stocks, banning assault weapons - all things we can do to reduce gun violence in this country"
3749 2018-09-21 16:54:03 The richest 10% own 84% of stocks. 
Nearly half of Floridas 67 counties had fewer jobs than a decade ago according to a 2017 report by business friendly Florida Chamber of Commerce Foundation. Scott has been in office for  8 years.

3758 2018-09-21 16:51:45 Sorry, betty, but your tweet just proved that you don't know what a narcissist is or how much this country has benefited from President Trump's leadership.  Lowest unemployment among blacks in history of keeping records, lowest unemployment overall in 40 years, growing GDP/stocks
3759 2018-09-21 16:51:42 Not every stock is overvalued but when the investors of such stocks are getting punished for no reason doesn't feel good.
3760 2018-09-21 16:50:56 buy lots of weed stocks
3761 2018-09-21 16:50:41 @OutnumberedFNC the reason the markets are up is the consumer and business confidence Brought about from effective policies (trade and deregulation) and trump. Stocks are traded in the open market between regular john and jane doe and the consumer having conf in their investments
3762 2018-09-21 16:50:29 NEWSFLASH: Trickle-down economics is still a myth! Instead of up lifting up their workers and our economy, mega-corporations are using their Trump-GOP #TaxScam windfall to buy back stocks, reward already wealthy stock holders, and giving out executive bonuses. #TaxScam2
3763 2018-09-21 16:50:28 Stocks will NOT trade off the absolute level of expected growth. Instead, they follow the direction & magnitude of their expected future #earnings There are times when price will divergence from underlying EPS est trends. When it does, we can exploit that.
3764 2018-09-21 16:49:53 Nasdaq 100 made a top 2 weeks ago. Every bounce in stocks like $AMZN should be sold unless that high is exceeded.
3765 2018-09-21 16:49:48 When Dominic Raab said there were "adequate" food stocks, I asked my (Labour) MP to ask him how much, in kcals per person per day, counted as "adequate". She did. So far, no reply. It's worth everybody asking their MP to do this.

NEVER buy stocks in 1 block. Spread the buying over 2-5 weeks or MONTHS, if required! 

10-20-30-40% works pretty well.

3773 2018-09-21 16:47:08 1/2 The Dow made a new all-time high yesterday & is still on a tear today. Given its odd construction (price, not market cap weighted), the reasons for this move aren't what you'd expect: Half the YTD gains for the Dow come from two stocks: $BA & $AAPL.

3776 2018-09-21 16:46:38 Tip for the new people in crypto and stocks. If you think about selling, just sell if you are at a decent up%, impatience is the silent killer.
3777 2018-09-21 16:46:31 Most importantly, I don't think the stock and bitcoin holders overlap significantly. Stocks are an old fellas club in there, and they see BTC with a LOT of skepticism.

3808 2018-09-21 16:37:55 Do you ever tweet anything positive? I follow the same growth stocks as you and own some of them. They can’t go straight up every day. Low volume consolidation is both necessary and healthy, so I actually welcome this. $NVDA $OKTA $SPLK $COUP $AAPL $NFLX $AMZN
3809 2018-09-21 16:37:45 Much more RISKY to buy overvalued stocks at this stage. IMO
3810 2018-09-21 16:37:44 I'll say and if they do short it, I'm taking a green bath at the bottom. Can't even take a quick nap right now, lol
3811 2018-09-21 16:37:08 That is why people like you shouldn’t be in this space, stick to your stocks and bonds.

3820 2018-09-21 16:31:39 Why havent we heard anything from cube yet? They really did kick them and just announced those "meeting" to stop their stocks from dropping more
3821 2018-09-21 16:31:04 The EU isn't always right; but it's not always wrong either. CFP - even when is was a bit of a mess at the start (it took too long to properly deal with discards) - was, certainly for UK fishermen, about trying to preserve plummeting stocks, and therefore, remaining jobs.
3822 2018-09-21 16:30:17 when y'all get on here talking about stocks instead of shoes and Nike ownership this and that but don't know the first thing about investment it kills me

3827 2018-09-21 16:27:27 Thanks Obama and the effects of compound trends.  On a downward trend since 2010, unemployment will reach record lows (even though the drop is slowing) On an upward trend since 2009, stocks will reach record highs (as if that helps the 65% who don't own stocks)

3832 2018-09-21 16:25:03 IPOs launched during a #VoidMoon don’t necessarily bring a corporation to its knees, but the overwhelming evidence she’s observed shows the stocks of these companies in the under-achiever category. #FinancialAstrology
3833 2018-09-21 16:24:42 Stocks reverse trend all the time without fundamental change.  All of that is manipulation too?  XRP is just stupid people FOMOing, not manipulation.
3834 2018-09-21 16:23:11 GOP is out of touch and only cares about the rich. Little tip for y’all - stock market all time high and 401k plans skyrocketing means nothing to those that don’t have stocks and 401k plans and those that got tax cuts are buying stock not increasing jobs or wages
3835 2018-09-21 16:22:58 not me :( hopefully there's another store that stocks them up again
3836 2018-09-21 16:22:45 @Deishma sir can you list of stocks which can withstand and give good returns from now on
3837 2018-09-21 16:21:19 @GigglesNHugs $GIGL Of screw the Nasdaq. plenty of good companies on OTC - just look at all the #marijuana stocks there.
3838 2018-09-21 16:19:50 What do you think will happen when companies stop buying back their stocks (artificially inflating the economy) while not paying their employees properly and the middle class runs out of money from paying pass-through tariffs?
3839 2018-09-21 16:19:48 Do we still have any laws about getting people into the stocks?

Cos if so, David Cameron should be in them right now
3840 2018-09-21 16:19:34 Yes understood.  Also understood for these super risky play, you don't notify here because it is too risky!   

It may make sense to buy OTM options on these super volatile stocks so that if it is wrong, you can lose the bet. 

Congratulations for the big win!

3869 2018-09-21 16:07:06 Today is quadruple witching day - when stock index futures, single stock futures, stock index options & single-stock options expire on the same day.

3896 2018-09-21 15:56:12 As volatility will persist, it will be best not to take any positions home,

1. Either trade intra day or for one day
2. Play with Long Strangles in volatile stocks

Buy and hold only if you are a long term investor whose anxiety levels are not inversely proportional to the Nifty

3898 2018-09-21 15:55:42 Another way I'm now considering is itm 45 day out calls with a delta of 60+. Safest from a risk perspective and almost a stock replacement strat with less capital needed to get the same gains as long stocks.

3915 2018-09-21 15:51:23 so far very happy with how others have acted in relation to TLRY. MMs always gonna use whatever excuse to shake down other stocks but the market knows once again that CGC is THE leader (and soon ACB will join it).

3947 2018-09-21 15:40:41 Except for NEPT and HEXO, of which I still believe can go up further into the future, not a bad day for jr marijuana stocks that really haven't participated when compared to the multi-billion MCs, rest assured they've all gone up a lot within past 6-12 months, esp last few weeks.

Nifty 10860, Axis 580, MnM 870, RIL 1180, RELINFRA 330,BRITANIA 5400, SBI 253, HDFC 1910, Maruti 7600 and the list goes no...Who sold n who bought ..These are the levels from which resp stocks gave breakout ..what will fall further n how much is a big ???

3961 2018-09-21 15:37:22 My job wants me to buy stocks. Like wtf is that. Some wolf of Wall Street shit.

3963 2018-09-21 15:37:00 nop, this is the only way i trade stocks.
3964 2018-09-21 15:36:55 I'm 70% stocks 30% cash. May take some profits soon. Got 100 shares of $F at 9.43. Waiting for some fire sales. Got a long time til cashout
3965 2018-09-21 15:36:44 Sir when I am in doubt just I put partially in a index fund like Nifty50 + keeping cash to invest more if it dips further.

In market where everything is falling looks cheap difficult to choose one or two stocks.

Today added some funds in Nifty50 Index and a housing finance co
3966 2018-09-21 15:36:31 As far as bounces that appear to have more room to rebound, I'm watching $TNDM $GOV $PVTL $EGAN $SAIC $FNKO $ACOR 

These are the top stocks that are due for a bounce.  Some appear to be already happening slowly but steadily...
3967 2018-09-21 15:36:31 Such definitions are of little use in stock markets. 

An investor should buy when their stocks are at "comfortable" valuations & traders should trade in direction of market. 

Mr Market will do what is has to. We have to stick to our process & be disciplined.
3968 2018-09-21 15:36:13 Toward the end of the day take a hard look at the US pot stocks. If sitting on 5sma/10ema after a thrust yesterday, odds good for more fireworks next week.
3969 2018-09-21 15:36:00 Yes etrade.. can buy through broker though
3970 2018-09-21 15:35:04 Took a decent loss on $AWSM short today. Completely should have avoided it both long and short. These stocks that have huge spreads give absolutely no way of properly managing risk and can be very dangerous... New rule: completely avoiding stocks with more than 10c spread.
3971 2018-09-21 15:34:19 @SquawkStreet Gartman admits he uses a substance and buys stocks in a substance that kills millions and destroys people’s lives but insults people who invest in cannabis and video games?
3972 2018-09-21 15:34:03 I'm finding quite a few stocks trading at 150% of average volume. Pocket pivots in the making... Lots of charts to look at.
3973 2018-09-21 15:33:59 Todd, if I'm not mistaking the update should read "race now rated" instead of "race now raced." Great read.
3974 2018-09-21 15:33:55 Through who?  eTrade?  Running out of shares...people are holding them tight.
3975 2018-09-21 15:33:47 These will be the highlights and headlines of the Trump era! Tax reform will change to raping the country so 1% can buy back their stocks. WAKE UP! #TrumpCrimeFamily

3977 2018-09-21 15:33:32 Its OBVIOUS to many (with a brain) that BIG Pharma Donors & the BIG Pharma stocks in your investment portfolio, will keep you from doing the right thing.  You are CORRUPT! Go after the real pushers! Make sure not to hurt those that really need the pain relief.

3985 2018-09-21 15:32:41 One last thing. You newbies thought this was easy? Perhaps a genius in pot stocks? Here’s what most likely happened to most chasers —> “Oh shit, look at $TLRY. I need in.” - loss. Next: “Damn manipulation. I need to make it back. Oh shit. $NBEV. I need in.” - loss. Rinse/repeat.

4017 2018-09-21 15:23:56 Depends on time horizon too , if ppl always use SLs , many wouldn't be holding stocks for 5-10-15 years , and later we cannot say ,if we had bought Eicher stock instead of Bullet , now we could have bought A Ferrari 
4018 2018-09-21 15:23:22 Hey everyone good morning, well I just wanted to say I have invested in another company on #Errade and got it for a lot of stocks as well. And I think my portfolio is definitely coming along really well. And I believe a lot of good things are coming in the future as well. 
#Money
4019 2018-09-21 15:23:20 Likely someone who was once a trader and an old fart, someone who has over 100 new accounts a year on LSE. The SP will only decline as it did in AST & many other stocks they caused market abuse in. Stocks that all have had corrupt director(s). Wonder how this works! #PREM AVOID
4020 2018-09-21 15:22:56 Peter Gold & Silver down again while stocks move up towards 27K & Cryptos too making significant gains! Your predictions on all 4 so far totally wrong to date, aren’t you tired of getting it wrong?!
4021 2018-09-21 15:22:51 Even seeing bids in $COTY and $GM recent lows and div's in 4% range. 

I have a theory PM's who have been hiding in bonds are moving to value div. stocks. We'll see.
4022 2018-09-21 15:22:46 Have you looked at the stocks lately?  Obama asked him where his magic wand was to do all that he claimed. He’s done everything he set out to do. Still waiting on Hilary, though. When that happens, there’ll be parades in the streets
4023 2018-09-21 15:22:45 @savestacks of all the traded weed stocks, what is the one that you would wanna have exposure to in your portfolio?

4025 2018-09-21 15:22:11 $SECI and $CDIX - two stocks to load up on now before the price increases moving towards the first of October. Anticipation of the news coming on both will drive up the price.
4026 2018-09-21 15:22:10 Yes, you should be FOMOing into weed stocks.
4027 2018-09-21 15:21:55 It’s gambling be better throwing your money on red or black  proper stocks is crazy money

4030 2018-09-21 15:21:22 And now watch as your steel and aluminium prices sky-rocket due to these terrible tariffs. Again your company is anecdotal when companies are laying off thousands of people and aren't hiring new employees but are instead buying back stocks. Look beyond your own bubble. I had to.
4031 2018-09-21 15:21:05 Look at these stocks! I practically grew up on Wall Street
4032 2018-09-21 15:21:01 $SECI   No one selling...everyone is holding their shares extra tight.  We know what we own.  Float is getting locked...share are becoming unavailable.

4037 2018-09-21 15:18:59 Sir how to select stocks as per ur stratrgy
4038 2018-09-21 15:18:41 ممكن يكون خلص أساسا .
عموما اذا بتطلع على النموذج الأكبر اذا فعلا اكسباندد فلات ممكن يوصل بين ١١٣ و ١٢٧٪ من الموجة ككل ، لذلك اذا بتكلم كصندوق من هالمستويات وصولا لقرب ٢٨ كلها مراكز بيع برأيي
4039 2018-09-21 15:18:31 Well, the stocks will be stocks. Doesn't matter what medium you use to value a piece of a company. Remember that!

4056 2018-09-21 15:13:32 $PCKK .25x.30 something is up.imo  a few straight .25 10k bids.  This is usually a strong indicator of something to come probably sooner than later in my opinion.  Normally you dont get a good chance of .20s on a 6 mil OS new trader.  So this could be one of those thankful stocks

4214 2018-09-21 14:34:46 @arunjaitley @narendramodi  Tnx to LTCG tax and SEBI's unrealistic dictate of ASM If we exclude the market cap of top 10 stocks, the remaining over 4,000 stocks listed on BSE have lost a whopping Rs 16.70 lakh crores since Jan 2018!  , realisation even if late is always welcome
4215 2018-09-21 14:34:40 I can't help you if you're penny stock proud. Everyone that follows me knows to take profits on trades. I did really think $FRFS was a lotto ticket but more evidence that all penny stocks end up going to shit. 

Trade them, don't marry them!

All IMO @TradingTeacher
4216 2018-09-21 14:34:33 That happens sometimes. Waiting for the US Fed to say they’ll commit to buying a trillion joints a month to support liquidity of pot stocks.

4219 2018-09-21 14:33:40 Tax cut given corporations. corporations used money to buy Back stocks. Bonuses to people who are compensated by fact that the stock prices went up. Scam was by cutting tax retirees would not pay as much tax when pulling out imaginary savings from the stock market. Market UP.
4220 2018-09-21 14:33:27 Proof the world is changing.  Two of my biggest profits in the stock market these past 12 months were in bitcoin/blockchain technology and cannabis/Canadian stocks.  It challenges the stock picking fundamentals I have used the previous 40 years.

4230 2018-09-21 14:30:10 ...not bad. It's fairly good actually. But besides that, companies can only do this for so long. Eventually stocks will inflate and the company won't want them back anymore. So this is only a temporary business move by corporations.

4334 2018-09-21 13:58:26 There should be no circuit limit for FNO stocks or it defies its purpose. What happens if I am Long on Stock futures but it freezes in lower circuit for days ? How will anyone get out. Same for Shorts during upper circuit. FNO stocks shouldnt have circuit limits.
4335 2018-09-21 13:58:24 For the Brexiteers who will crow about rising stock prices: stocks go up as pound drops because LSE companies have holdings outside the UK. It’s not an increase in value, it’s a slide in the pound’s buying power.

4348 2018-09-21 13:54:23 Holy crap, compare the $btc weekly with $acb (or other cannabis stocks) crazy stuff. Thanks to @ChartGuys for breaking it.
4349 2018-09-21 13:53:53 This shit stinks. It's a new profit/ market opportunity but it still stinks,  and it's as bad as second hand cigarette smoke. In some cities smokers just light that shit up anywhere. It's foul. I invest and I wasn't inspired by Weed stocks whether they are profitable or not.

4351 2018-09-21 13:51:52 Prices are falling in Manhattan because of Brexit or was Putin? I am sure it had nothing to do with reckless central bakers policies inflating a grotesque global property bubble! #stocks are at all time highs, what could possibly go wrong?
4352 2018-09-21 13:51:44 What a terrible way to ruin these stocks by putting them in an index w VZ or T.  Also XLU only real defense sector left!

4364 2018-09-21 13:48:30 Tilray's recent move explained:

-There’s simply too much capital in America chasing too few US publicly listed cannabis stocks.

-Tilray is unique in that only 10% of its market cap is free floating.

-Currently the annual cost to borrow Tilray to sell short is insanely high

4376 2018-09-21 13:46:45 Every 25 year old with a cell phone is now trading stocks and options and starting trading services, I have never seen anything like this since 2000.

4385 2018-09-21 13:44:00 “Stock market wealth has been flowing disproportionately — and increasingly — to the most affluent households. The richest one-tenth of Americans own about 84 percent of the value of stocks.”
4386 2018-09-21 13:42:59 > Stocks within a sector move together much more closely than in a broad index.

Which is why I'm thinking the Hindenburg indicator might actually work as a within sector analysis. If you see both lots of new highs and lots of new low, within a group of assets that should move

4408 2018-09-21 13:36:29 So nice of you to point that out. Even thou about half of Americans own some sort of funds, stocks etc. The richest 10% own 84% of stocks value and the richest 1% own about 38%.

Ignoring trade-war headlines to focus on improving earnings, rising GDP growth and a tide that seems to be lifting all boats. Advancers outpaced decliners by 3 to 1. Foreign stocks appear to be stabilizing.

4585 2018-09-21 12:36:18 no matter how many warnings you give, new traders are going to go heavy into pot stocks thinking they'll become rich. some may see explosive gains, some may be smart and escape with profit. most will end up giving it all back. but they think they know better than you.
4586 2018-09-21 12:35:24 Yup not many stocks out there with a 10% free float eh?
4587 2018-09-21 12:35:18 There stocks should be their stocks.  Obviously your superior education isn't showing.
4588 2018-09-21 12:34:30 So how are these indices in the US keep driving higher only with a few names now?  A lot of divergences with many stocks below Jan highs.

4598 2018-09-21 12:29:11 Go heavy on intermediate bonds before the close. Rebalance 2 years later on maturity into dividend stocks. Cash is still king so will keep some on the sidelines to be able to play the margins profitably as the index finds a bottom.

4615 2018-09-21 12:23:56 Man what do you think stocks are reflective of? Some fairy with a computer program?
4616 2018-09-21 12:23:40 Good morning.

I don't care how many screens you have you can't watch 100 stocks at the same time. If you're going to put in the time to look for good set ups set an alert before you leave that stock so your not wasting your time. $SPY
4617 2018-09-21 12:23:14 So you are already buying. I think today was a good day to get some bargain on quality stocks.
4618 2018-09-21 12:23:08 Because it does..we don't have millions to leave our kids or own stocks. The little we MAY have gotten from it has gone for higher fuel & grocery costs. Plus, tariffs are supposed to raise prices even higher.. we'll LOSE even more.

4621 2018-09-21 12:21:01 @darshanvmehta1 : any idea why Insurance stocks are under pressure ?
4622 2018-09-21 12:20:39 This time will be different!! Lol! Because then everybody would know it's a bubble  I guess the sign would be when Pot stocks are listed on crypto exchanges with double rally . Can it happen?
4623 2018-09-21 12:19:40 Not all true.  I own stocks and Im neither.
4624 2018-09-21 12:19:08 Checkers liquor and making sales of stocks they don't have 
4625 2018-09-21 12:19:06 in stocks you cannot relate to the quote "you miss 100% of the shots you don't take"
you have to focus, hit the swing only when you are comfortable not every ball the market throws at you

4636 2018-09-21 12:16:42 You know he doesn't keep it all under his pillow, right? The money is invested, either back in Amazon, or in banks which onward invest in stocks, which form companies, which employ people. Macro economics is both very complex and also very simple.

4641 2018-09-21 12:15:40 Oil-related stocks were immune to any kind of fall, no downside pinbars seen on daily charts, astonishing.
4642 2018-09-21 12:15:23 He is good but the way he tweets seems the problem. It feels he is taking personal revenge with stocks. And if somebody reads the language, he will think that he might have lost heavily in that stock that's why he is tweeting like this 
4643 2018-09-21 12:15:09 He sold all his stocks...to avoid the crash.

4649 2018-09-21 12:13:22 What's more irresponsible, cowardly, and grievous is @realDonaldTrump hasn't done one single thing to prevent this from happening again. He said folks were afraid of the NRA, apparently this includes him. He was going to ban Bump Stocks, he didn't.
4650 2018-09-21 12:13:09 Yes 50% was absolutely irrational!! I felt the same way.  Also this really dampens retail investor sentiment.  Like sure it may be in F&O band but maybe sebi needs to review limits on f&O band stocks too. Also maybe temporary filters need to be longer time wise?

4652 2018-09-21 12:12:34 I have missed out on the momentum gathered by pot stocks. Truth is I have always held the same opinion on pot stocks like bitcoin. Trade it, don't invest it. I have never believed in both. Short squeeze and pump and dump are mainly responsible for the up trends.
4653 2018-09-21 12:12:27 Market cautiously viewed YES Bank’s sharp correction and RBI’s open market operation. Later, the tension escalated under the fear of liquidity crunch and tighter norms by the RBI. Cascading impact was seen in high beta stocks and sectors, in expectation of tightened liquidity
4654 2018-09-21 12:11:49 importance of staying with the trend, the market charts and NOT the noise.  Just before Labor Day we were constantly reminded that Sept was the worst calendar month of the year.  Not last year, and so far not this year.   Did you dump stocks on that fear?

4664 2018-09-21 12:06:48 Seriously, stocks look like extending nicely into next year, as much as I hate to say it. Tightening cycle is like the 04-06 cycle on Valium, but just as predictable. I guess when it decides to go parabolic we can start thinking bubble. Until then, risk takers love certainty.

4675 2018-09-21 12:03:01 Short squeeze would be great right now. One of the highest shorted stocks on TSX right now. Shorts added 40% more in two weeks.
4676 2018-09-21 12:02:35 And I see more down trend in stocks at the end of the rising rate cicle, not at the beginning.
4677 2018-09-21 12:02:00 F&O listed stocks don't have any filters . They can go any % in both directions.
4678 2018-09-21 12:01:59 Today stock markets got spooked by a crash in finance company stocks, partly triggered by recent loan repayement defaults by IL&FS. There is fear many more NBFCs may fail to roll over short term borrowings due to contagion effect. Fingers crossed!

4682 2018-09-21 11:59:37 @MadMoneyOnCNBC @CNBCFastMoney @CNBCnow  It's amazing a Network like CNBC uses their broadcasting strength to promote or destroy stocks to help out their partners / buddies.  Yesterday, CNBC used the whole day to destroy $TLRY cause their short buddies were losing big money.  SAD
4683 2018-09-21 11:59:19 I will add that $AGH register is far better than $CAN .. And with the licenses and all $AGH is at better position than $CAN at the IPO

4705 2018-09-21 11:47:06 It has diminishing purchasing power, it's just a matter of where that money flows. In U.S. and Japan the money has flowed into the financial sectors, bidding up prices of bonds and stocks to where their valuations are no longer tethered to fundamentals. Housing is also affected.
4706 2018-09-21 11:46:34 Individual net worth reflects value of assets like homes, bank accounts & stocks minus debts & is not reflective of much of US.

4739 2018-09-21 11:30:52 Quoi qu'il arrive pour une personne vraiment impatiente, c'est mieux de prendre sur la preco chez apple, pour les gens qui veulent profiter des facilités de paiement des revendeurs, il n'y a pas 36 choix, les stocks sont limités donc les premiers arrivés sont les premiers servis.
4740 2018-09-21 11:30:31 Every time I see this tweet I keep thinking are chicken stocks up? Why is there a stock market and not a Broth market?
4741 2018-09-21 11:30:29 Even while marijuana is still being "stigmatized" "investors are investing in stocks" legally, since they don't have to smuggle it now.
4742 2018-09-21 11:28:43 Today #Sensex drops 1500 points and then recovers to end just about 280 points under. A lot of tweets about #brokers advising to sell #Stocks! Damn look likes brokers earned a lot today with this panic selling and rumour mongering!

4795 2018-09-21 10:59:15 Why just Dhfl? Even YesB & other stocks fell 15-20. Point is that long trader in DHFL say hypothetically with 1 lot would have been long 2 lots before June'18. So the damage would have been worse. You can say it also curbs gains accordingly but rallies don't happen like this

5035 2018-09-21 08:32:48 Securities tokens/ STOs are not alt coins or currency.

Securities are tradable agreements such as bonds or stocks - Ex: shares of Apple & IBM are securities.

Tokens are simply a different form of security than paper.

Seeing securities as a competitor to Bitcoin is a mistake.

5088 2018-09-21 07:58:50 With some stocks at very cheap valuations.. which stocks did you buy today ?
5089 2018-09-21 07:58:40 Default in IL&FS. Just hearing 'default' reminds people of Lehmann Brothers and so it leads to panicked selling. But this can't even remotely be compared to that. Traders exit which leads to such a heavy fall. In fact, it's a great time to buy because great stocks just got cheap.

5139 2018-09-21 07:31:05 It seems good. They have bundles you can invest in, or you can invest straight up in a company. You can invest small amounts either once or recurring. You can read up on stocks before you buy into it. I've only had it for a month, but I like it.

5155 2018-09-21 07:23:47 I should have added BTC as well. That sounds like ridiculous mania. I was in it with my friends maybe 7 years ago and so wasn't really exposed to the mainstream hype as much. In my circle of friends it's old news.  Stocks aren't exactly cheap either, but not as much hype I guess.

5218 2018-09-21 06:43:27 "What are you doing with pot stocks right now?" Waiting for the smoke to clear! While legalization may lead to nominal increases in demand; that demand may not be for the product any individual company produces. There are likely to be a few winners, but I believe far more losers.
5219 2018-09-21 06:43:00 Seems to me that in the past 10- 15 years ( which is as long as ive been in the game) biggest group winners have been holders and profitable traders  of tech stocks like amazon , Nvidea ect.
5220 2018-09-21 06:41:51 Btc is a bearer asset, buy 1 btc, own 1 btc. Value of that asset goes up as demand does. That’s not a pyramid scheme. By your logic stocks are a pyr scheme. The rest of your argument is time specific, right now focus on solidifying sound money, later all dapps on sound base

5224 2018-09-21 06:36:40 Doc, there is a big problem with the price listing. Say, if S(N) and B(N) are selling/buying prices when there are N stocks available, if a person buy 1 then sell 1 instantly, the price difference would be S(N)-B(N-1). If this diff is non-zero, this could easily be exploited!

SEPTEMBER 20, 2018 / 5:01 A: U.S. refiners face emerging glut
LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. refiners have processed a record volume of crude in the last three months, reversing the previous shortage of distillate but leaving the country with record gasoline stocks
5285 2018-09-21 05:45:57 Its worse to make a  lot of money in stocks only to blow up later. An important lesson from Jesse Livermore's life. Staying rich encounters lot of difficulties.
5286 2018-09-21 05:43:54 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
5287 2018-09-21 05:43:46 Stocks are risky, treasuries are not( if held to term). But unlike treasuries, stocks can possibly provide capital gains &dividends to more than offset the risk you take. As interest rates rise, newer treasuries pay more, and they start too look more appealing compared to stocks
5288 2018-09-21 05:42:49 When stocks have big run ups without consolidating they are subject to falling back down just as fast. It’s only when they’ve had time to consolidate rising and falling across multiple days/weeks that they can sustain the trend. Why did anyone try to chase $CPV and $KTD

5307 2018-09-21 05:32:13 What I'm saying is high stock prices aren't really 'good' unless you are wanting to sell.  Same thing for home prices.  And stock prices don't always reflect underlying economy.  They just show if people & institutions are putting their money into stocks or not.

5310 2018-09-21 05:30:08 Right. I'm aware of the howey test. What I'm getting at is that not all securities are stocks. I believe if XRP were to be considered a stock (as a way to raise capital with the expectation of profit) it would be catastrophic. Derivative securities aren't stocks, for instance.

5383 2018-09-21 04:30:30 So much garbage, but after seeing pot stocks make dumb moves, it reminds us anything is possible. We are in one of the most speculative times. Look at the macro. Crypto mkt 17 —> 833 bln in 1 year. Speculation is rampant in times of cheap money. There will be pain.

5423 2018-09-21 04:04:31 That's because they offered employees stocks if they stayed for two years. Was part of the fraud..so..sorry..we..made..u ..sell..lies....deal.

5432 2018-09-21 03:58:35 The challenge is the bond market is set to dive when people move out of stocks, negatively impacting returns until interest rates are near peak and interest rates can’t climb until there is a sustained period of wage and price inflation, which we want, but don’t. I am confused!
5433 2018-09-21 03:54:49 equity volume in US stocks looks like a smile with most activity nearer the open and close- volume dries up 11:30-2. I’m not a fan of any daily manipularion thesis but if it bottoms at 11:30, means being manipulated higher on lower volume when easier, not vice versa.

5437 2018-09-21 03:54:01 Eh.  I come and go.  Depends on how my life is at the time.  I do trade still, but wary of the trade situation.  USD has been strong.  I dropped out for a while after the election, but I shouldn't have.  I just didn't know.  My stocks are great though!

SNB keeps printing money, buying $AAPL & collecting dividends.

5468 2018-09-21 03:31:46 @saitek88 that’s called a non value pump and dump. The stocks down over 20%. No good company goes down that much regularly
5469 2018-09-21 03:31:17 Stock market is at record highs. Avoid these wastes of time and money: 24 hour trading and trading schemes; chasing hot stocks and making big bets; guru timing advice; reading research till midnight; going on margin; paying fees for advice.. instead, do LT regular indexing.
5470 2018-09-21 03:30:52 $SPY So many good setups. Remember though that some stocks will rise with the tide (market) but not all will continue higher. Be selective.
5471 2018-09-21 03:30:51 US stocks rose strongly on Thursday, with both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 setting records, as strong economic data helped to alleviate concerns about escalating tensions between the US and China over trade.

5501 2018-09-21 03:17:36 The more it goes up, the harder will be the fall.  Stocks are currently overvalued.  The last time the economy was artificially stimulated (the housing bubble in 2008), it was a VERY hard fall.  It’s just a matter of time.  Tick tock, tick tock.

5542 2018-09-21 02:47:11 Yeah, I do. I have for 30 years. 

Trump claiming credit for record high stocks is financial illiteracy from POTUS. Record highs in any given year are pretty normal.
5543 2018-09-21 02:45:42 There’s more money to be made trading pot stocks than just buying into one overhyped pot stock. Especially OTC pot stocks. No smart computers or algos disrupting trades.
5544 2018-09-21 02:45:33 If anybody has any morals they wouldn't invest in pot stocks. Pot is a gateway to other drugs.
5545 2018-09-21 02:44:43 This is a lazy "I fixed it" brag from Trump.

If you look at stock market records year on year, it reached a new record high most years in the last 30. (GFC obviously reversed that for a bit). It's why people invest in stocks for retirement long term.

5550 2018-09-21 02:43:41 Just trade stocks and work. Make money doing nothing.
5551 2018-09-21 02:42:38 Honestly, liquify you assets. Buy Remington and S&W.  Sell before January 1 (tax break).  Short the the biggest healthcare and pharma stocks (cvs/Aetna, Pfizer, astra-Zeneca); divest into medical marijuana.  Cash out at 300% and buy all the land you can in 2021.
5552 2018-09-21 02:41:08 I mean everyone has the ability to buy stocks so it’s not his fault people don’t want to let their money make more money....
5553 2018-09-21 02:40:54 If you’re willing to buy and sell same day. Stocks don’t move in straight lines up. When then hype dies out this will crash and burn. Be careful!
5554 2018-09-21 02:40:09 How many of these MFers in the crowd even own stocks?
5555 2018-09-21 02:39:55 Thx I didn’t know someone could close their covered calls before they get stocks taken for extra $. I guess it’s buying your own covered calls? Lol Why bother doing all this for a little premium? Guess it is a good strategy if you really want to sell anyway.

5586 2018-09-21 02:18:43 My broker mentioned some similarities with the 29 crash with regards to speculative investing driving the value of stocks higher than what they are really worth. A lot of companies borrowed money to buy back their own stock causing the price to go up. This is similar.
5587 2018-09-21 02:17:45 It’s become a total farce - made all of them laughing stocks.   The rest of the world must be rolling on the floor.  We are run by the stupidest idiots ever.

5610 2018-09-21 02:05:40 What are your thoughts on pot stocks?
5611 2018-09-21 02:04:40 Don the Con

The stock market primarily benefits the wealthy and some others who are fortunate to own stocks or have a 401(k).

However, roughly half of Americans do not own any stocks . . . so the S&P and Dow are meaningless numbers.

Your unfounded tax cuts are for the wealthy.

5633 2018-09-21 01:54:02 Thursday PM Wrap: Mortgage Bonds closed @ $101.88, near unchanged. I think as the economy continues to improve and as stocks rise, homeloan rates will likely follow suit and rise closer to historic norms. If ya wanna buy a home, delaying will likely be costly. #BetterCallGreg

5635 2018-09-21 01:52:24 Yeah i noticed the rail up frony, zenitco right? The usmg galil stocks use a standard rear tang, unless youre just wanting to use a folder trunnion, in which case im assuming youd go triangle folder? Also the moe ak plus grip from magpul is a great grip for 20$. It what i use.

5640 2018-09-21 01:48:55 People getting excited in #Cryptocurrency right now. All those that cashed out in December and January, only to put their funds in traditional stocks  still need a few more months to hold there so they don't have to pay a higher tax rate. I don't forsee a bull yet.

We are forced to work without valid medical certificates n valid contracts whenever we try to talk to them
5643 2018-09-21 01:47:51 Great for the 1%. Not so big a deal for the majority of Americans that live paycheck to paycheck and cannot invest in stocks.
5644 2018-09-21 01:47:01 This is one of those stocks where I believe it’s prudent to sell no more than half, pay yourself back the initial investment X’s 4, and then use the rest to buy cheapies to push the share total above where it started. $$$
5645 2018-09-21 01:45:12 YEEESSSS!!!!  sameee
5646 2018-09-21 01:44:36 It is very easy to top end a company's 1/4 sales report, (cut incoming product and boost delivery to retailers) not very ethical, but if Nike backs someone like this! It is probably what is going on. Share holders get a wiff of this, stocks fall, if not it will show up soon!
5647 2018-09-21 01:44:02 Gonna talk about how you banned bump stocks?

5651 2018-09-21 01:39:13 Maaaan, nothing really tells you more about the state of "business as usual" in late capitalism than stocks in an industry plunging at the mere announcement of a government enquiry into that industry.
5652 2018-09-21 01:38:27 I’ll be buying low and selling high and aiming to own 10% of the shares before the 5th. Sorry but I’m getting old and tired.

5658 2018-09-21 01:32:50 And Oct 1 will mark the one year memorial where more than 500 people were shot there. Are you going to tell the people that you support the ban of bump stocks? Of course not, because you sucker down to the @NRA
5659 2018-09-21 01:32:43 Spent a lot of money today like a fuck ton on a hard asset and thought I’d be happy I got something I wanted since I got into jewelry but I’m still like fuck everything. Need these stocks to pay off
5660 2018-09-21 01:31:06 OMG: I traded stocks for over seven years and have never seen this much bullish bullshit over anything in my life! I will tell you one thing, the short interest in this is so over blown that there is no way but up and a major one at that. 

Keep up the good work @SatoshiLite
5661 2018-09-21 01:31:03 Are they trying to tell us to short pot stocks?

5665 2018-09-21 01:28:21 That profit sits accruing interest & I'm sure they invest a portion into stocks too.
5666 2018-09-21 01:28:17 $SPY See so many people so quick to call top on stocks and sell, just when they're starting to breakout on heavy volume.
5667 2018-09-21 01:26:37 Why are all these cannabis stocks I’m researching at a 52-week HIGH? 
5668 2018-09-21 01:26:36 You could put a few bucks in Uranium stocks. You'll get a good return for the next few years.

5670 2018-09-21 01:24:59 So They get away with saying whatever meets their goals. No objectivity. Might as will invest in Chinese stocks!

5673 2018-09-21 01:23:51 What cannabis stocks do you have
5674 2018-09-21 01:22:32 Seems like guys get home from work and need to trade the hot stocks, then they rip, follow the trend. I do a few no and then.
5675 2018-09-21 01:21:13 I’m still a cautious bull on stocks, especially if we make it to October at this altitude. However I don’t think there is always a 1:1 correlation between stocks and the economy, but for now they seem attached at the hip. So the answer to your question is yes. Haha!
5676 2018-09-21 01:20:39 I guess if your well off and have money to put into stocks your doing great. But the majority of Americans don’t have any extra money to invest. Most people weren’t born rich like you were.  Your so out of the loop and clueless.
5677 2018-09-21 01:20:22 I don't either, but just in case I bought stocks in a sunblock company so I can wild out in this life.

5698 2018-09-21 01:04:22 Not Tariff..many companies now use money saved from taxes for stock buy back thus rallying up the stocks..wait until next years will new inventories starting to pop up in stores..that is when we know how much tariff is affecting everyone
5699 2018-09-21 01:02:02 My problem is so many people think their coins are going to be used as a form of currency & most the space are just useless tokens, which I like to relate them to what shares are to stocks.

5702 2018-09-21 01:01:15 Jobless claims record low. 

Stocks record high.
5703 2018-09-21 01:00:33 None went to zero, and if still held today, they did better than bonds or cash. Point taken though - if you believe we’re on the cusp of another crash, expect pretty much all stock funds to get hit. But for the part of your portfolio in stocks, diversification is a nice ally.
5704 2018-09-21 00:58:38 Stocks will change
5705 2018-09-21 00:57:52 There was minimal job increase because of the tax cuts. Most of us got minimal tax breaks and they will expire while corporations got massive and permanent cuts which did not translate into jobs because most corporations bought their stocks back at a profit.

5718 2018-09-21 00:47:47 The longer your investment time horizon, the less your expected capital growth rate is affected by whether equities are expensive or cheap when you buy them. With Buffett's 100+ year time horizon, it's no wonder he's still buying stocks.

5739 2018-09-21 00:36:37 131. There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.
5740 2018-09-21 00:35:51 You should do a combo cooking and stocks show. I want trademark rights.
5741 2018-09-21 00:35:35 Society seems more open to the legalization of marijuana unlike 10 years ago. These stocks have given birth to a new line of investors who have never invested before. Hopefully Oct. 17th will bring these stocks enough profit margins to back up the stock value.

5754 2018-09-21 00:27:08 U know the stock market and the economy r 2 dif things?  Like most Americans r living paycheck to paycheck and can’t afford stocks or bonds, or even an emergency of more than$400. 1% u gave tax breaks to took it all.
5755 2018-09-21 00:27:05 I belong to a range. We won’t allow bump stocks on our range at all. Every time someone asked about allowing them. The same response is used. NEVER!!!  They might make a semiautomatic fire faster. But it also make the gun so inaccurate that it would wreck our backstop houses.

5757 2018-09-21 00:25:12 There is a very, very fine line between patience and greed. Holding a stock when it’s going up while having the intention to sell at some point is an extremely hard thing. People see stocks go up and think ohh all you have to do is buy and hold but don’t realize the bumps enroute

5765 2018-09-21 00:23:14 My worst investment this year is antibiotic biotech stocks. This sector just a mess. Holding some bags from there.
5766 2018-09-21 00:21:23 U.S. stocks closed higher Thursday, with both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 setting records, as strong economic data helped to alleviate concerns over escalating U.S.-China trade tensions.

5772 2018-09-21 00:17:33 Yan din ang dapat sbhin ng lazada kung ilan ang stocks nila.
5773 2018-09-21 00:17:07 This is what the stock was telling us when it sold off on strong earnings back in March in the 60’s. When stocks sell off on good news, it usually means there’s something down the road.  The margin pressure and earnings reductions are not a surprise.
5774 2018-09-21 00:16:28 Stocks still good to me
5775 2018-09-21 00:16:11 I know. The sticks have gone crazy in a good way. Especially the cannabis stocks. They are going to keep going up for at least another few months since they’ve legalized it here
5776 2018-09-21 00:14:49 @RX931 #PagNanaloAkoSaLotto I will buy stocks sa company but I’ll still work with that company as regular employee #TheMorningRush
5777 2018-09-21 00:14:14 Very eager to see how these weed stocks play out in the next month. If they have staying power more shorts will get run over. Seems like a coin flip at this point.
5778 2018-09-21 00:12:28 Stock market only pertains to half of the US population. The other half doesn’t own stocks
5779 2018-09-21 00:12:20 I should sell my stocks...
5780 2018-09-21 00:12:08 Per dividend yields, S&P 500 Index may correct up to 6% in the near term. Anything more should require a fundamental change. The higher it goes, the riskier it will be to stay invested in stocks, but somewhat higher prices are quite possible, earnings are still growing... $SPX
5781 2018-09-21 00:11:55 Awww. Limited stocks lang daw yata din kasi. Pero bet ko din yung shade eh. Sana lang bagay saakin (if ever na makabili ako) hahahah
5782 2018-09-21 00:10:04 Yessss talk KISS and the stock market JIM!  The dow jones hit a new record high today!  Try to pick at least 20 stocks to build your stock portofolio
5783 2018-09-21 00:09:44 What a bunch of fools. Try working for a living instead of playing the stocks. What goes around comes around.
