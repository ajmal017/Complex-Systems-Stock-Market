9 2018-12-24 23:56:57 Stocks close with sharp losses, Dow -650 points.
10 2018-12-24 23:56:15 I'm starting to think this was very intentional, they shorted a few stocks knowing what the impact would be.

40 2018-12-24 23:52:58 He was checking on cash levels because is expecting a prolonged government shut down. Not because of falling stocks, or Fed hikes.
41 2018-12-24 23:52:53 How many stocks in S&P 500 has a market cap of more than $100B as of today?
42 2018-12-24 23:51:39 Chrom has everything you need (speed, range, damage) but lacks a recovery. Palu is similar, but instead of lacking recovery, her CQC is super wack. Inkling also has everything, but can struggle to take stocks. Also there's Snake, but he ain't easy to use.
43 2018-12-24 23:51:37 I hope you’re young enough that there will be time for it to rebound and for you to be OK. There comes a point in our life cycles when we move away from riskier vehicles like stocks because there may >not< be enough time for the losses to rebound.

48 2018-12-24 23:50:20 But bump stocks would be under the constitution. Literally the banning of the bump stock has opened the door for a ban on all firearms parts and accessories. The sheer fact government bans exist in this nation itself is counter to the Constitution.

Obama (Inaugural 2009 to Dec. 24, 2010): +47.7%

53 2018-12-24 23:49:45 Hi Venkatesh, have you got any idea about the stocks he holds
54 2018-12-24 23:49:44 A “bear market” is when stocks see a 20 percent decline or more from a recent high — but they’re also marked by overal
55 2018-12-24 23:49:24 Only idiots can believe a Wall cannot be defeated by a $20 ladder,a El Chappo tunnel guy.Also thanks to you>having a shitty Christmas with Stocks&401K in death spiral Also,Why would any reasonable American follow,believe your Financial savvy when you went 6xBankrupts?Resign pls
56 2018-12-24 23:49:24 The UST market is about 60% of total world stock market cap IIRC. Cannot be easily or quickly replaced without making ten year returns on stocks hopelessly negative!

59 2018-12-24 23:48:39 Well that's what corporations pay politicians for so they can pass the buck. Anytime govt gives corporations $$$(welfare check) they buy back stocks and pay investors. It never goes back into company or employees.  To the family the employees (peasants)  should be happy employed
60 2018-12-24 23:47:12 Dow close Dec 31, 2015...17425.03
Dow close as of Dec 24, 2018...21,792.20.
Feel free to correct my arithmetic, but that is a roughly 20% INCREASE since President Trump took office. If your stocks are tanking, maybe you need a new investment advisor.
61 2018-12-24 23:46:44 Knarly af.
What’s cool is I just used that chart to show honey-bunny where I’m buying her new stocks at for Christmas

64 2018-12-24 23:46:02 He will say that shorts and bears are making more than ever before in the history of the US economy and how he has made all these stocks available for people “at a discount” so even the poor can afford to invest. It’s part of the MAGA rebuilding plan...
65 2018-12-24 23:45:16 When your mate decides to randomly turn up at your house at 9:30 with Christmas presents to try cheer you up ! Thanks Rachael Petch love ye lots ! Was also lovely to see Katrina Stocks today aswel xx
66 2018-12-24 23:45:04 @KeithMcCullough Should we be buying stocks?
67 2018-12-24 23:45:02 Low liquor stocks but we’re finding various ways to improvise bottle cap shots tonight, come by for real time surge pricing.
68 2018-12-24 23:44:57 Just heard on the news that Dow Stocks lost a Trillion dollars this month, that is right month, not months or year but month. Are we winning yet?
69 2018-12-24 23:44:54 I don’t casually know any stocks that rapidly grew, but it’s similar to picking up a random wideout or running back in fantasy and then they start averaging 20 a game
70 2018-12-24 23:44:39 When closer to retirement, you desire less to bet or guess. That's where I find myself with alternative investments from stocks. I hope I'm wrong, but this is not the old school stock market anymore and I worry about those that stake their future on it.
71 2018-12-24 23:44:11 Spy: 313/500 stocks down at least 5% since last Wednesday

Since Wednesday, only 5/500 SPY stocks returned + returns.  Like and follow if you like the facts. Thanks
72 2018-12-24 23:43:43 Honestly, between you & @healeytypes’s glitter snorting.... maybe you two should consider using those decorative gift bags that Dollarama stocks by the hundreds... it could save a life. (Or at least time & dignity...)
73 2018-12-24 23:43:18 Sell stocks and buy bitcoin $btc
74 2018-12-24 23:43:13 Hmm... yes. In any case... m/t bearish with the main market. I'd expect EPS to improve a little for Q4 earnings, but lack of user growth is the problem for all the social media stocks.
75 2018-12-24 23:43:06 HO HO HO ... way to #MAGA  as stocks plunge, Fed workers go without pay at Christmas while Erdogan and Putin do a high five to celebrate their control over Trump's foreign policy
76 2018-12-24 23:42:52 Fundamental misunderstanding, rich people cashed out September/October at the first flattening. This is the 401k’s and the careful long term middle income loosing a lot of this money while rich crooks are making money by shorting the stocks based on the volatility of the @POTUS
77 2018-12-24 23:42:29 There isn’t much to the stock market tbh... the “experts” know nothing. It’s pretty much a guessing game. Similar to fantasy sports, there’s certain stocks that always go up a little or stay the same (Walmart, McDonald’s) but the ones that actually make the difference are guesses
78 2018-12-24 23:42:29 Why did #Mnuchin call big banks today? Is it possible he knew stocks would tank, & his rich buddies would benefit? The crooks continue to destroy our country &
destroy every member of the working class in America. #TrumpResign #LockthemUP @robreiner @RWPUSA @PattyArquette

80 2018-12-24 23:42:17 Ok, that would specifically be the Space division at Boeing (for SLS launcher) and Lockheed Martin for Orion. Try their sites for more detailed program info. Their stocks do pretty well on these big contracts! Also check NASA technical reports server for interim progress reports

88 2018-12-24 23:39:51 @Rule1_Investing my first year investing as a Rule1er I’ve beat the S&P bench mark by 20% simply by sitting in cash  waiting for blue chips to become penny stocks
89 2018-12-24 23:39:41 You said Amazon twice. You should have known the downturn was coming and removed your clients from high growth stocks 3 months ago.
90 2018-12-24 23:39:32 Stocks are in a hilarious position right now
91 2018-12-24 23:39:14 Hey, Awesome! Thanks for making the stocks and the #USdollar plunge, @realDonaldTrump! Now I can exchange my pounds for a few pennies more to buy cheaper stocks.  I was afraid with #Brexit my pounds would be worthless.
92 2018-12-24 23:38:40 You forgot that stocks had had a parabolic runup in both cases (1987/now).  That is the real cause.
93 2018-12-24 23:38:26 @realDonaldTrump @GOP @SenateGOP @HouseGOP Well, congratulations President Nimrod. You have also managed to cause an economic collapse with your dumbassed trade war. WORST DECEMBER FOR STOCKS since the Great Depression. You really are making history. #TrumpResiqn #gopRequiem

97 2018-12-24 23:37:41 Great advice- I've been vested in Stocks for over 40 years -and it's only a Paper loss - just like 1987 - market goes up and market goes down it NEVER goes away - HOLD'EM and enjoy the holidays
98 2018-12-24 23:37:36 I want to thank the white house for drowning all mt stocks , Merry Christmas
99 2018-12-24 23:37:36 Since you don't seem to understand anything about finance or Investments, stocks and all assets are bought when it is dropping in price.

101 2018-12-24 23:36:58 Schumer and Pelosi want to blame Trump because he is trying to protect the illegals and Trump wants to protect us. Stocks dropping ? Blame Schumer a nd Pelosi. They do make a cute couple though.
102 2018-12-24 23:36:49 Can someone explain to me the relationship between oil and US dollar in stocks and forex trading. Why is it wen they z a downtrend in oil the same happens to us dollar @50Pips @ALLTHINGSFOREX
103 2018-12-24 23:36:49 They have to raise rates, housing, stocks, credit card, student loan and auto debt at all time highs. Left too low too long. They created the bubble and get no blame.
104 2018-12-24 23:36:45 The #PermanentPortfolio down 0.25% on Christmas Eve. Another rough day for stocks, with some compensation from bonds and gold.

106 2018-12-24 23:35:52 Worst December stocks ever since the Great Depression.  Wow.
107 2018-12-24 23:35:50 If your not close to retirement don’t worry. It will eventually come back. This is what stocks do. They go up then they go downthen they go back up. Make sure you are diversified in four types of stocks.
108 2018-12-24 23:35:43 Trumps Government Shutdown,  not making sense now, worst Christmas eve day ever for stocks because of temper tantrum trumpet,  SO SAD  
Not time to reward bad behavior by big baby. 
TRUMPS SHUTDOWN. 
CRY, CRY BABY
109 2018-12-24 23:35:30 Financial stocks have been dead money for many years.
110 2018-12-24 23:34:45 Exactly. 

One of my buddies in the stock market will only get into crypto when RobinHood is available. 

IMO it's a pisspoor excuse on his part for not getting into crypto. 

His stocks are so bloody.

Crypto will continue to pamp.
111 2018-12-24 23:34:39 Si le vendeur est un con et hautain, alors il mérite d’être traité de la sorte. Mais dans le cas où le vendeur est agréable, courtois et poli alors il y peut rien. Dans tous les cas il gère pas les stocks 
112 2018-12-24 23:34:18 I asked you to talk about the STOCKS!

Hello?
You blame?

Helllllllo !

U r alone because you are a MONSTER!
113 2018-12-24 23:34:13 When you blame Trump for stocks when everyone else blames the FED. Yes... Moron
114 2018-12-24 23:34:10 @realDonaldTrump .Stocks lose $1 + TRILLION in value in December....so far
115 2018-12-24 23:33:49 My parents are sitting here complaining about how Trump ruined their stocks and then I'm like "So we all hate Trump, right?" and my fucking grandma and parents are like "WE HAD NO CHOICE, THE ALTERNATIVE  WAS HILLARY!" and all I can think is you'd pick a fucking fascist who's...
116 2018-12-24 23:33:33 Dow Stocks have lost a trillion dollars this month. ....CBS reporting. OMFG! #TrumpResign
117 2018-12-24 23:33:23 I couldn’t agree more that we are in a terrible spot with the market Watching particular stocks and not the market can still help you gain financial success Merry Christmas to ALL                  Thanks to All those that help me

119 2018-12-24 23:32:54 We are in luck it was written. I don't see it getting any better. Hate to say it to the ppl that lost out n going lose more in stocks "here comes the pain"
120 2018-12-24 23:31:35 Gotta tell ya now that ever since I mostly bailed out of my stocks a few weeks ago this crap really doesn’t bother me much anymore
121 2018-12-24 23:31:30 Done with work! 

Hardly looked at the market today! Stocks Looks like took a beating! 

Have a great Christmas you all!
122 2018-12-24 23:31:25 I want the DOW to drop to 3000

Cryptocurrencies will boom while stocks dump.
123 2018-12-24 23:31:09 He just banned bump stocks. You want all guns to be taken away so the dems can finally take the control they want?
124 2018-12-24 23:30:50 Rebuild your election your gonna need all the money and do have any? Fear of what others think of your lies or how you've brought Don stocks lives, Middle East look to the west....Fool
125 2018-12-24 23:30:27 He owns Exxon and Chevron too.  What a hypocrite.  He accused other people of owning "big oil" stocks when they were on CNBC opposite him, stating negative facts about Tesla's financial condition.
126 2018-12-24 23:29:29 It's simply named RSS. Random Stage Switch on, set to 2 minutes. Stage select is Random. All the bad an BS stages are turned off. FS meter on. Items could be on or off depending on the mood. 8 minutes, 5 stocks. It's a hell of a good time. Best played with 3 to 5 players.
127 2018-12-24 23:28:50 Ivan, you are a guru, there are far more less well known stocks that actually went bust and where people lost everything :)
128 2018-12-24 23:28:39 I don’t know a lot about stocks, but buybacks would “undilute” the outstanding shares, which should preserve the value, if not increase it. Maybe it’s just that the DOW doesn’t correlate well with a buyback.
129 2018-12-24 23:28:29 Translation: my stocks are diversified so I am safe but I should virtue signal somehow
130 2018-12-24 23:28:22 Not at all. I like stocks, but my feeling say that MR Roubini is very angry on some humans with dreams
131 2018-12-24 23:28:09 Nah. Across 1000's of companies? It would be news. Investors jumped in when they believed Trump was going to strip mine the USA into a money machine. Now that they see his incompetence and the strength of the voters, some of those overvalued stocks look quite a bit pricy IMO.
132 2018-12-24 23:27:56 I feel like this is all a scam by the rich people who own stocks. They are the ones who are buying all the cheap stocks in a time like this only benefiting them when prices go up. What’s really going on?
133 2018-12-24 23:27:19 Even my historically solid stocks are crying tears of pain right now. Which S&P are you in? I'm looking them over right now
134 2018-12-24 23:27:16 Salad cream is the great lost condiment on a cheese sarnie but with Italian? I'd go stocks rather than jail though. What can you do, how many Brits eat bread with pasta?..

136 2018-12-24 23:26:45 Lol. You are being hard on the lady. Mutual fund could be low duration biased e.g money market, 2-4 yr maturity fixed income fund. Markets could turn bullish, no one really knows and if valuation is her thing, picking stocks in bearish regimes is valid.
137 2018-12-24 23:26:39 There is one thing I totally agree with this president and that’s him banning bump stocks. Do you agree as well?
138 2018-12-24 23:26:38 @realDonaldTrump The slump came after the stocks last week had their worst week since the Great Recession a decade ago, and the last time the market fell so far in December was in 1931, during the Great Depression.”Winning”
139 2018-12-24 23:26:31 Um wrong.....they had a deal until Trump messed it up.  He owns this.  Stocks plummeted today and tariffs are killing farmers.  Merry FUCKING Xmas!
140 2018-12-24 23:25:54 How so. Stocks gain value based on the growth in profits of businesses. Crypto is fiat currency too. It's not backed by anything. So any gain is purely speculative and not based on anything
141 2018-12-24 23:25:41 I wasn't going to look at my stocks out of pain, but maybe this is actually a sound plan
142 2018-12-24 23:25:04 Stop by the Trump Tower and leave a card for your hero who just banned bump stocks.

145 2018-12-24 23:23:58 Looking at the latest on stock market — as volatile as it gets today, — wondering if it is good or bad to convert some of the most volatile stocks in one’s portfolio into crypto.
Any advice? #stocks #markets #StockMarket #stockstowatch #traders #cryptocurrency

147 2018-12-24 23:23:20 Why is it 'concerning'?
Its Normalisation - If the fed hadnt been supporting stocks artificially for a decade this wouldnt happen. 
@donaldTrump heralds normality and a return to sanity, surely?

'Concerning' to whom?
Are the homeless and factory workers 'concerned'? Doubt it.

150 2018-12-24 23:22:42 I can’t wait for the woke article to be about how cheering stocks doing bad is problematic because it means people are losing their jobs, because that’s coming soon
151 2018-12-24 23:22:29 Why fight the HUGE CROWDS to see the Ball drop in Times Square, NYC on NEW YEAR'S Eve, when you can watch the Dow, the S&P 500 & the NASDAQ ALL DROP on CHRISTMAS Eve??
#Trump #TrumpMarket #DowJones #Dow #NASDAQ #stockmarket #stocks #TrumpShutdown #ChristmasEve #ChristmasEve2018
152 2018-12-24 23:20:57 What’s that I just read- worst Christmas Eve for stocks in HISTORY?!  You should be proud!  What’s that I also just read- tax cuts for the wealthy totally backfired?  YOU ARE TO BLAME.  And your ridiculous golf analogies.
153 2018-12-24 23:19:20 So are poor people and the middle class. Their retirement money is invested in stocks and mutual funds. When the market drops like this, then jobs get lost. And guess what Einstein, they're not the jobs of the rich! So, in the spirit of Christmas, STFU!

156 2018-12-24 23:18:18 Ppl hear a few ppl say buy low and sell high and think stocks/forex is really that easy lol that’s really why only 1% are successful traders

FOX Reports Some Retail Stocks Are Up  On Day Before Xmas!
159 2018-12-24 23:17:22 I don’t find it odd at all. If you can’t sell what you want you sell what you can. There are so safe stocks to hid from the bears when they take over
160 2018-12-24 23:17:08 But our stocks tho!!!!
161 2018-12-24 23:17:04 Gonna need a second job now that stocks are in the tank, any openings at the WH?
162 2018-12-24 23:17:01 Just retired last year was great stock market was doing so well. 401k and personal stocks. Now worried lost lots of money. Has to get better next year. Will see#
163 2018-12-24 23:16:36 I don’t own stocks, but I paid off my house. Fuck the stock market.
164 2018-12-24 23:16:35 Buy stocks Daniel :)
165 2018-12-24 23:16:34 These takes are hilarious — they were selling a lot of sandwiches today at the Subway I go to, why is everyone selling stocks?
166 2018-12-24 23:16:28 That's nice, but it will take a bureaucracy bigger than HHS + the Pentagon to even *define* "corporate welfare." Then you've got a discrimination case that will take a generation to work its way through the courts. 
You see why "Ban bump stocks" is a win?
167 2018-12-24 23:15:42 Did he?  Or, did Mnuchin’s distract the fact that the Mnuchin’s took a Trump on the taxpayer’s dime? Or, that it could cause artificial tanking so they could be vultures and buy up stocks?
168 2018-12-24 23:15:27 Once again, if you kept your money in stocks once Trump was elected, lol.
169 2018-12-24 23:15:27 Ive been lurking forums and such and real panic hasnt set in yet. Typical bs: buy and hold, fundamentals are good, dont time the market, stocks for the long run, etc. Noone really gets whats happening yet lol
170 2018-12-24 23:14:42 Merry Christmas to my friends and followers! Grateful for you all. A red & green day for #Uranium stocks, in the spirit of Christmas. Patiently adding to positions as the broad market continues to bleed. When it turns, we'll all be celebrating. Happy holiday to you and yours 
171 2018-12-24 23:14:23 The New York stock exchange witnessed people massively sell-off their stocks just because of comments made by Trump’s treasury secretary! That’s is how sensitive investors are.
172 2018-12-24 23:14:17 @realDonaldTrump's cronies are making hundreds of millions of dollars Short Selling in the stock market. It's obvious! Just like when he imposes tariffs, they make millions on the stocks of the companies that tariffs protect.  #TrumpResign
173 2018-12-24 23:14:17 Stocks looking shitty like crypto huh? Lol
174 2018-12-24 23:13:53 You’re allowed to panic in ways that doesn’t involve selling off stocks in a panic?
175 2018-12-24 23:13:40 The DOW has been way too high and it reflects 30 stocks.  I'd be more concerned about the inverted yield curve as it may be the indicator that is depressing investors and turning the market sour. But stick it out now. It's too late to jump ship. The market always comes back.
176 2018-12-24 23:13:38 This is making america great again per donald the dick trump
Stocks are on track for their worst December since 1931, during the depths of the Great Depression.DAMNNNNN
177 2018-12-24 23:13:16 Stocks on track to have their worst year since...2008? The year of the Great Financial Crash? Don't tell me the most capable POTUS ever in regards to finances is presiding over this? It cannot be. We need to get someone in that admin that has experience saving an economy. Who...
178 2018-12-24 23:13:12 So happy to see all my stocks in the toilet, except for the WWE stock I bought as kind of a laugh.
179 2018-12-24 23:11:51 I’m 90% cash, 5% gold miners, 5% oil stocks. Does that answer your question? Once market trend reverses back up, I may re-enter the market, probably later than I should. But I want a trend not just a bounce.

Cash represents a great option to (re)enter the market later.
180 2018-12-24 23:11:30 Nah that Dow Jones drop is wild. Stocks bleeding, government shutdown, Trump got on Jordan sized slacks. Wild times in the USA.
181 2018-12-24 23:10:16  Watching the stock market carefully this go round, I refuse to loose another $50,000.00 from my stocks again, I’ll take all my sh*t out this go round before I let that happen again, I’m not playing these games with y’all President 
182 2018-12-24 23:10:00 My sister and her hubby have taken a severe beating on the 401 k's. They are Trump supporters. I feel bad for them, but not devastated. My sister says she'll ride it out and stocks will rise again.  SMH.
183 2018-12-24 23:09:44 @John7Istheman How are your stocks doing?
184 2018-12-24 23:09:06 so, this guy is over the top negative!? he was same way at 2016 lows, calling for a crash, 1200 SP, bankruptcies in all metals and oil stocks. stayed negative for about 40% up in his face. then, was a total bull, calling for big SP breakout end of Sept 2018.,wow
185 2018-12-24 23:08:13 Great replies, folks. Everyone feels this. Middle class particularly since their 401K mostly mutual funds and ETF. Over time stocks have the best returns. A 60/40 stock bond mix historically weathers the storms. You haven’t “lost” anything unless you sell. 1/2
186 2018-12-24 23:07:48 Don’t expect gains like post Jan. ‘17 to this summer for a while though. The onyl reason stocks gained so much was because the Fed was too afraid to raise the interest rates in 2016-2017. They warned investors they were going to do it, and here we are panicking. Nobody should
187 2018-12-24 23:07:42 $SPY $DIA $GLD $GDX incredible volume today for an Xmas eve shortened trading day.  I'd like to see a little more volume in individual gold stocks but $GLD and $GDX are off to a good start this week
188 2018-12-24 23:07:36 People who don’t own stocks still feel the psychological effects of a down market.
It gives the impression that things are going terribly wrong.
It’s a domino effect.
189 2018-12-24 23:07:24 People are pancaking way too much, everyone is selling at a loss, and I am just like "Got to put every freaking penny I have on these ridiculously cheap stocks!" So while the dumb investors lose all their money, when the stock market picks up, I am score a huge chunk of change!
190 2018-12-24 23:07:16 I would buy because you should consider a dip in the market as stocks being put on sale!

Executives: $20

"December is usually a healthy month for stocks, but this month has been the worst since 1931."
194 2018-12-24 23:04:55 Yes. He recognized it and pointed it our but didn’t think it was fed’s jobs to tell investors how to value stocks.
195 2018-12-24 23:04:54 It does not matter what the Stocks are doing if you are young & in it for the long run. It’s only hurts the Traders & who cares about them
196 2018-12-24 23:04:28 Both times the market has tanked in my adulthood my 401k has had less than $5,000. I’ll never actually have something worth retiring on at this rate. I truly get this sentiment, but the rich could loose 75% of their stocks value and still be fine.
197 2018-12-24 23:04:20 ALSO I am goddamn pissed at the stock market!!!! Out here got me trying to take all my money out of all my stocks like I haven’t had this shit building up for five years!!!!

Merry Christmas!

"December is usually a healthy month for stocks, but this month has been the worst since 1931."
205 2018-12-24 23:02:42 I meant elites switched from investing in traditional industries that make things, to investing in financial markets with easy money from central banks that massively inflated assets. Big Tech Stocks like FAANG are examples.
206 2018-12-24 23:02:33 Stocks plummeting. Unions dividing. Leaders screaming and shouting to get themselves the last word. Protests unheard. Death and poverty. Ignorance and hatred and fear.

209 2018-12-24 23:01:49 The use of public stocks as punishment isn’t legal any more, is it? What about tar and feathers? Forcing people to stand on street corners wearing sandwich boards proclaiming that they are criminals? Just asking for a couple dozen #GOP senators.
210 2018-12-24 23:01:47 Damn, I wanna sell my stocks right now but it’s not the best time to. 
211 2018-12-24 23:01:29 the forecasts are saying 2019 will be a bad year for "having stocks" but a great one for "getting an rv"

215 2018-12-24 23:00:33 Wasn’t saying your statement was ridiculous. I just didn’t know that you had stocks.

Yes, buy the dip and hold. The market is correcting itself, but it’s even starting to destroy 2017 gains. Just hold and it will go back up within a year or two once a Dem. is elected to WH.
216 2018-12-24 23:00:20 Yes they’re definitely playing with their stocks!!!

218 2018-12-24 22:59:59 Or for the Americans 401Ks & stocks you tanked with shear stupidity?
219 2018-12-24 22:59:54 That's right you haven't a clue how the market works for real people since you can trade off inside information and have brokerage firms throwing IPO's at you. Stocks go up And down but the economy is far stronger than at any time u were speaker
220 2018-12-24 22:58:41 If S&P DOW NASDAQ is down while other stocks Quote is trended Up, what situation of volatile trade is it for this other stocks, when not control by government governance. With this info join rhmtimz.turdzre@yahoo.co.uk/finance_mobile-home trade don't be pushed away eternally

222 2018-12-24 22:58:00 Yeah but it’s middle class people who will suffer. The rich will scoop up all the cheap stocks and make a killing.
223 2018-12-24 22:57:12 You’re always paying full price for the stocks you buy
224 2018-12-24 22:56:12 Ah yes, because poor people have many, many stocks and shares.
225 2018-12-24 22:55:57 Well said. Same in retail generally. My stocks have dropped 30 percent in a month.....except for yours. Thanks and keep it up. Merry Christmas 
226 2018-12-24 22:55:44 Can someone check if Trump and his friends have been shorting stocks the last month?!?
227 2018-12-24 22:55:39 If this is true, then why do stocks dive whenever the feds raise interest rates? How many insiders are making money off of shorts? If it was truly erratic behavior,  we would not have had so many increases and records under Pres Trump as we did.
228 2018-12-24 22:54:31 You only need external checkers when your record is digital and the item in query is physical. If it can exist as purely digital ie money, stocks, bonds then you can get away with not having a trusted third party. But sometimes self custody can be risky. Once you lose it it’s gon
229 2018-12-24 22:53:50 Yes! The data is there for those willing to see it for what it is. 

The current downtrend in stocks surely has executives thinking about cutting workforce to weather something bigger. Don’t even get me started on consumer debt levels and those who buy a new fit weekly for IG.
230 2018-12-24 22:53:45 is now a good time to tell all the business majors that voted for trump and are posting their stocks crashing on their stories why that’s happening .. .?? Or should I wait until they’ve lost everything ...
231 2018-12-24 22:53:16 I'm pretty much done with stocks.... strictly gold and real estate
232 2018-12-24 22:53:02 Yea i heard @kevinolearytv say in an interview that he ONLY buys stocks that pay a dividend and i started following that philosophy. One company to look at is @IBM they were giving one of my customers $6 per share as a dividend
233 2018-12-24 22:52:41 Wish I had savings to invest in stocks ! No money in saving lives 
234 2018-12-24 22:51:53 Might just buy a load of penny stocks n scam people like the wolf of Wall Street, am poor n need a car
235 2018-12-24 22:51:34 Magpie, there's market truth  you don't care to tell people.  1st, Mnuchin @ the Fed raised rates .25% when Trump knew he shouldn't, and stocks fell.  They Mnuchin scared everyone saying he had "called all major banks and everything is ok", spawning fear.  Stocks fell again. 1/2
236 2018-12-24 22:51:31 Meanwhile stocks are in a free fall. Thanks Trump.
237 2018-12-24 22:51:31 Christmas Eve day. Take a walk in the woods, take a nap, figure nothing else will happen 

Stock Markets: Hold my beer!

Kevin Spacey: *shoves Stocks Markets on the ground and scrambles over them*
238 2018-12-24 22:50:34 It’s unfortunate that all of our 401ks, IRAs, Roths, mutual funds, ETFs, stocks and bonds are all going to zero soon....
239 2018-12-24 22:50:04 Most Americans don’t own stocks millionaire corporate Dems such as out and #NancyPelosi . If stock market losses put a dent in the one percent’s insane amounts of wealth I am all for it.
240 2018-12-24 22:50:03 All I'm saying is.. thank goodness mental instability seems to be 'in' right now. My stocks going up.
241 2018-12-24 22:49:55 U.S. Stocks, Obama vs. @realDonaldTrump 

Obama (Inaugural 2009 to Dec. 24, 2010): +47.7%

Trump (Inaugural 2017 to Dec. 24, 2018):  +3.9%

(S&P 500 data, not including dividends)
242 2018-12-24 22:49:23 (Stock of what companies? :B)
It was my understanding that stocks do a bit of a nosedive around big holidays? People pulling money back out to buy presents and stuff etc? Or is it a bit more pronounced this time?
243 2018-12-24 22:49:20 Funny, when stocks were crazy up he was amazing a mire 6 months ago..... Is there anything this guy doesn't get blamed for??? Our own dipshit in our backyard plays a vital role too
244 2018-12-24 22:49:09 Good question. The draw down in the stock market is going to exacerbate the decline in real estate (Total margin borrowing on stocks ~275B vs ~70B in 2007). Any further decline is going to cause ppl to sell even more stocks... and cycle will continue. (1/2)
245 2018-12-24 22:49:06 I get nervous if stocks of AA and AAA drop below 100 apiece. Pro dad tip: a dozen or so LR44 also a useful addition for those unexpected small toy emergencies, along with a ph1 screwdriver...
246 2018-12-24 22:48:47 Ummm....the Secretary of Defense resigned, an I'm not going to argue an "I quit" "your fired" situation with you.
The Fed raised the rates for the 4th time after the DNC check cleared the chair's account, so no wonder stocks took a dive. 
The only one waging war is you.
247 2018-12-24 22:47:50 Another scary thought is how stocks have still fallen despite the fact that all those tax breaks the top 1% received were used for stock buy backs.
248 2018-12-24 22:46:56 For us yes :) but for Venkatesh no :) as he breath in/out of stocks
249 2018-12-24 22:46:47 Twas the night be4 Xmas and all thru the white house, no one was working because of a gov't shutdown, the stocks were crashing while 14,000 children sat in a cage, our allies no longer trusted us, top officials were leaving, and our planet was in need of help. Merry Xmas to all!
250 2018-12-24 22:46:35 Yesterday - Industry: #SOFTWARE & SERVICES was 16% Positive, with #DIVERSIFIED FINANCIALS 2% Positive. Stocks: $AVL was 15% Positive, with $SPX -3% Negative. #ASX
251 2018-12-24 22:45:51 But the same framework applies for BTC, gold, real estate and stocks as well. With stocks there might be added value and with rented real estate as well. But with gold it is he exact same. I don’t like “ETH is a ponzi” while everything else has similar characteristics. One sided
252 2018-12-24 22:45:42 Most of the market moves together. Defensive stocks don’t move down as fast as the averages but they still move down. They may be down 30% on a bear market where the major averages are down 50%
253 2018-12-24 22:45:21 My dearest,
The mas of Christ is ever nigh. I long to withdraw stocks in the morrow at a fair price, bringing splendid gifts upon my return. Others claim ‘twould be not possible for tiny, orange hands ruined all chances. I don’t know how much longer we can take. #WarOnChristmas
254 2018-12-24 22:45:12 Invest 10% back into how I got it. To keep the coins flowing in. Save 40% of it. The other 50% will be used to invest into other endeavors and/or stocks. 
255 2018-12-24 22:45:12 Yesterday's top 10's: $SPX, $PLS, $BCB, $LIT, $ASX, $NMT, $AJM, $FBR, $MYO, $TRY, and #ELLIOTTWAVE, #AUSBIZ, #ASX, #TRADING, #GOLD, #LITHIUM, #STOCKS, #MINING, #AUSPOL, #FOREX
256 2018-12-24 22:45:01 Very little capitulation. Majority of Wall Street Economists & Strategists remain firmly bullish on US economy and International stocks.  May get interesting when this cadre begins throwing in the towel.
257 2018-12-24 22:44:33 Make sure to remind your parents & such to check on their 401ks. Unfortunately over the last few years employers have just shoveled their money in mutual funds and ETFs that went with the market.

I know one client who had a bulk of their 401k in FANG stocks and is very worried..
258 2018-12-24 22:43:46 Didn’t open your mouth when stocks were up. Typical
259 2018-12-24 22:43:35 @darkcandle7 how are stocks across the pond bro?
260 2018-12-24 22:43:29 Congressional democrats are getting paid.
Stocks fall after the horrible results of the 2018 election
261 2018-12-24 22:42:36 This is a lie. And do you see what stocks did today? That’s all on you.
262 2018-12-24 22:40:55 Stocks are like weather, altering almost continuously & without warning; businesses are like climate, changing more gradually/predictably. In the short run, the weather gets our notice & appears to determine the environment, but in the long run it’s the climate that really counts
263 2018-12-24 22:40:37 Agreed. Just know that bear markets can last a while. Stocks don’t recover quickly once they are down this much.
264 2018-12-24 22:40:19 No, I don't.

I don't want to reconsider being okay with billionaires losing money that they could have invested into the fate of live humans instead of their stocks.

Have a great day.
265 2018-12-24 22:40:05 Sorry Nancy. This is on you and the other Dems. If you would’ve voted yes for Wall bet you would see stocks go up. Try it   Work for what the American people want. Look at the Go Fund Me for wall. That speaks volumes about what Americans want.
266 2018-12-24 22:39:41 There are other ways to "accumulate wealth" than investing (sic) in stocks.

So I should buy when DJIA is at 22,000 and sell when it's at 18,000? Please, I don't think I'm going to take your advice.
267 2018-12-24 22:39:11 I'm buying all my lifelong hold stocks right the hell now
268 2018-12-24 22:39:10 He prolly shorted some stocks.
269 2018-12-24 22:38:05 I love how for decades Republicans said we should ditch Social Security for “investment accounts” tied to stocks.
270 2018-12-24 22:37:58 Respected by WHO?  Stocks crashing, government crashing, totaling 70 years of respect in 2 short years. WOW. many people say that’s diabolical.
271 2018-12-24 22:37:56 Wow. Your aunt fails to realize that there are other things at risk other than her stocks.
272 2018-12-24 22:37:36 Why is Trump afraid to go to Mar-a-Lago? Does he think that the membership (@$200K a pop) will turn against him as their stocks are rapidly losing value?
273 2018-12-24 22:37:11 Income statement divided Treasury stocks bonds
274 2018-12-24 22:37:07 No one is too poor to own stocks....perfect to buy low. #shoogitboom
275 2018-12-24 22:36:51 Si este año las cryptos tuvieron un mal año, las “techie” stocks no se quedan atrás.
276 2018-12-24 22:36:48 @jimcramer @MadMoneyOnCNBC so what happens to either T-mobile or Sprint stocks if the merger is approved and they become a new company?
277 2018-12-24 22:36:24 This tweet shows real ignorance. 80% of America can't even begin to think about investing in stocks. You must live in a bubble
278 2018-12-24 22:35:58 I’ve been investing in stocks for about 24 years so far. Never ever worried about market timing for stuff I owned. As a sell side analyst had to play that short term game for over a decade. Waste of time.
279 2018-12-24 22:35:54 And of course, even a defined benefit pension becomes vulnerable at some point because its funds are invested in ... stocks and bonds.
280 2018-12-24 22:35:44 More likely stocks go up and then down based on the $$ pumped into and out of the market by the Federal Reserve via TARP, QE and interest rates manipulation.
281 2018-12-24 22:35:35 Obama said all the success of the stocks and jobs these last two years were because of him, so that means the drop is on him as well, no?
282 2018-12-24 22:35:12 I had a feeling I'd be glad that we cashed in our stocks when Blotus was elected. They are safe and sound now.
283 2018-12-24 22:34:33 I like buying stocks at a lower rate!! Who’s selling bring it on!!
284 2018-12-24 22:34:30 Poor you??? What about the rest of us that just watched our stocks tank??? Every time you open your mouth or tweet we all lose money for our retirement.  Can you please just resign and put us all out of our/your misery?!?!? #ResignTrump
285 2018-12-24 22:34:11 I’ve been reading that it’s the worst December for stocks since 1931
286 2018-12-24 22:34:11 Corporate America, bought back Trillion dollar worth of stocks from tax break.  Those who need the most got little, and rich got billions.  Could have built many walls with so much money.
287 2018-12-24 22:33:54 Why is Trump so obsessed with stock market?  He won the 2016 election by attracting working class voters in the midwest who likely have little or nothing invested in stocks.  Not only is he tone deaf to these voters but higher stock prices aren't going to make them jump for joy.
288 2018-12-24 22:33:49 Not happy with Trump these last few weeks. Bump Stocks, specifically the 2A, is a red line for me. He will not get my vote in a primary because of it.

293 2018-12-24 22:33:18 Why is everyone on the left and now some right crying about the stock market and blaming trump. A. Everyone knows don't gamble on stocks with money you can't afford to lose. And B. He did ask the Fed to not mess around they did anyway and here we are. #BLAMETHEFED
294 2018-12-24 22:32:57 What an incompetent dotard.He's trying to reassure investors that the administration is "stable". Stocks fell anyways. Guess the markets don't like volatile POTUS insulting fed and government shutdowns.
295 2018-12-24 22:32:40 2018 will be one of the worst years for Stocks on Record. However, once the Currency Schemes had gone a couple years, there was always going to be a period of problem Markets & at least a mild Recession. Once it had gone on for over 5 years the R-Word started getting replaced....
296 2018-12-24 22:32:39 We have had to minimize the amount of my 401k invested in stocks. We do have a separate stock portofolio that has taken a hit, but we aren’t touching it so we haven’t lost a penny. I’m definitely doing some stock buying on Wednesday.
297 2018-12-24 22:32:26 Stocks drop again as Steven Mnuchin calls bank CEOs about cash needs. S&P 500 on pace for its biggest monthly percentage decline since 2008!
298 2018-12-24 22:32:16 Or running v Usain Bolt (fast) or Elliod Kipchoge (long)! Individual stocks are my gambling. Fun and games but no expectations and much better return 
299 2018-12-24 22:32:02 Stocks close in on bear market as Trump and Mnuchin fuel
300 2018-12-24 22:31:53 Is that percentages of stocks owned by households, i.e. excluding foundations/endowments/trusts/foreigners? Why does it add up to 100%, in other words?
301 2018-12-24 22:31:28 Dear Santa, Stocks are on pace to have the worst December since the Great Depression. The Presidents cabinet just lost the only qualified member. Can we please get some adults to run the country?  @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer @senatemajldr #MerryChristmas #end2018please
302 2018-12-24 22:30:42 I just wanted to make it clear to people that unlike what John said earlier, Bitcoin is not in the same place market-cycle-wise as dot-com stocks were in 1999. If you want to debate on whether or not Bitcoin has any intrinsic value, that’s a different story. Some get it some dont
303 2018-12-24 22:30:13 Oh no, what are you going to do know now that your precious stocks are tanking like crypto buy $btc $neo $eth $nexo $gas
304 2018-12-24 22:29:48 the title of my 2018 christmas hit single will be “Why Do Babies Cry so Much (WHY) “ loosely based on my 1yr old niece and the fact that it’s 10:30pm on christmas eve and we won’t let her drink the prosecco/climb the stairs alone, available in all good retailers while stocks last
305 2018-12-24 22:29:40 Or, anyone with stocks or anyone in America because the economy is crumbling
306 2018-12-24 22:29:40 I was thinking the same.  Probably they sold others like XLK XLF and bought safe stocks XLU XLP. Now the same ppl run to more safe cash.
307 2018-12-24 22:29:34 >stocks have tumbled another 600 pts today

It’s a Christmas miracle
308 2018-12-24 22:29:32 The stocks are not and never have been the economy. Their health is not our health; their distress doesn't begin to explain ours.
309 2018-12-24 22:29:20 Lots of stocks made parabolic moves these past few years... Makes me cautious of the 80/50 rule... Once the parabolic curve trend breaks... There is 80% chance stocks decline 50% and 50% chance they decline 80%... Or something like that lol... Lots of stocks down 50+%
310 2018-12-24 22:29:19 So everyone talks that the stock market is overvalued then get mad when there is a correction.   We dont have a free market and I am sure the plunge protection team is working diligently to prop up overvalued stocks.
311 2018-12-24 22:29:05 I lost what little savings I had in '08. I watched DJIA climb but had no way to get into the bubble again. I lost more and more, couldn't recoup. But I knew stocks were volatile. I guess a lot of other people didn't learn that lesson. Don't invest what you can't afford to lose.
312 2018-12-24 22:28:34 Wow! A 115 mile long contract! That's gonna take a while to read! Of course, you're such a simpleton that if it were a a one paragraph contract, you'd still get taken. How much stock have you bought in steel companies, Donnie? 'Cause stocks are collapsing, too! #TrumpSlump
313 2018-12-24 22:28:22 Is the good news you will have an opportunity to buy the same stocks 20% lower 
314 2018-12-24 22:28:21 “...our economy can best be described as a casino economy....investing in real estate, stocks etc....Manufacturing is constantly on the decline so the domestic demand is fulfilled by importing products from abroad.”
—-

That’s exactly what China wants.
315 2018-12-24 22:28:16 Trump gladly took responsibility for the stocks being up now all of a sudden it’s everybody fault but his grow up@little man
316 2018-12-24 22:28:14 wow, wow, wow, wow — this guy.
#stockmarketcrash #stocks #DowJones @BBCWorld #ChristmasEve2018 #WOW
317 2018-12-24 22:28:01 You are right up there with Donnie in the ability to lie. I have never stopped saying Merry Christmas.  You and trump must be imbibing far too much Russian vodka.  Or have you taken up his habit of sniffing adderall?  Just one question.  How are your stocks doing?
318 2018-12-24 22:27:51 I think it’s scary. I moved all of my 401K out of stocks last week. Wish I’d done it earlier. High deficit, global slowdown, relaxed regulations on Wall Street - doesn’t feel safe for the economy.
319 2018-12-24 22:27:23 On NPR this afternoon the invited "money" expert claimed that ordinary ppl should be celebrating that the market is so bad bc it means "you can buy stocks at a discount!' but also "ignore being afraid or worried and don't do anything/touch your money..just ignore it all!" 
320 2018-12-24 22:27:22 And the last time the market bombed, it was advertised a year in advance and every bank in Britain offered 8% few-year bonds, so I sold stocks and kept cash in those; regrettably not the case now.
321 2018-12-24 22:27:01 So do the Trump base own stocks?
322 2018-12-24 22:26:50 I bought stocks two weeks ago. They said it is a safe investment, less risky than crypto. Well...
323 2018-12-24 22:26:15 Investing in Stocks vs Trading Currencies... Trading Currencies one you can profit when US stocks are plummeting like today usually any pair that starts with USD will go down.. You can trade stocks to but I never done it before 
324 2018-12-24 22:25:41 How's them stocks going for you, btw?
325 2018-12-24 22:25:34 Fire the federal reserve chairman and go down the line till they get smart and get into thoughts of future business...
He blew it like bernanke...
Both dumb***’s...
They should be consulting with the biggest firms of stocks and bonds... make them do it, u have a pen...
326 2018-12-24 22:25:16 What stocks y’all own?? And what stocks are you looking to potentially buy?
327 2018-12-24 22:25:16 I trade ETH actively, have held ETH for extended periods, and think it is a good asset regardless of my "bashing" and mispricings. I own stocks and am equally capable of bashing stocks. XVG and TRX are trash, and I don't trade them. XRP is a joke.
328 2018-12-24 22:24:39 No dividend from GWPH-Other 2 pot stocks I own-I periodically option 4 some cash-tho I’ve lost some good stocks that way-Netflix come to mind
329 2018-12-24 22:23:29 dude somehow came up with a breathtaking misapprehension of stocks, investments, and "the economy"

rather than get mad, though, I'ma think about my wrap funds buying low and smile quietly
330 2018-12-24 22:23:27 Dow plunges in worst Christmas Eve for stocks in history as Trump blames Fed...
331 2018-12-24 22:23:06 My aunt told me my children's futures weren't as important as her stocks because they wouldn't live to be adults because liberals would get us into a nuclear war before then.  She is a MAGAt and if I were speaking to her I'd love to ask how her portfolio is doing.  Ass.
332 2018-12-24 22:22:30 Creating false panic and then he and el presidente can buy bank stocks low....
333 2018-12-24 22:22:29 So is there any chance trump & his cronies are scaring the Market down so they can buy low b/c they know they’ll all be losing their jobs soon. For all those rich folks out there buying up stocks, guess it’s another gift from djt. He did tell his friends he’d make them richer.
334 2018-12-24 22:21:59 Sure but I don't see why it matters as they are not correlated. The same could be said for Tulips in the 1600s or the Dutch east india company back in the day. The same bubble patterns. Or stocks in 08 :) no hate from me brother bear!
335 2018-12-24 22:21:51 Funny - if you turned a blind eye to stocks and looked at how businesses are doing and the real economy - you’d say things look good.  Gotta like the current despair and mid 30s VIX if you are a contrarian.  Need to see some productive bottoming action
336 2018-12-24 22:21:25 i'm not an investor, but investing in stocks always seemed really dumb to me because those companies are all run by liars and everyone knows it. if i had that kind of money i'd put it in nice real estate and hold on to it forever.
337 2018-12-24 22:21:12 @cnbc #democrats are why the market is selling off! All the fake news is hurting the market. CNBC is the reason people should stop investing in company’s like fidelity and Wall Street. Save your money who needs stocks anyways. Fake news is bad for Wall Street. CNBC will close lol
338 2018-12-24 22:21:04 Shutup Guy! You’re nobody to be criticizing anyone right now! Not that long ago you were recommending a lot of these stocks that have now been cut in half. Great job!!!
339 2018-12-24 22:21:02 yeah, i was watching some stocks, they were sharply going up, then sudden went down faster then trump on a dictator.
340 2018-12-24 22:21:00 The 2017 run up was bc of global growth. No Euro or Yuan crisis. Even Japan was growing. That’s why the trade war has been so rough on the stocks.
341 2018-12-24 22:20:45 Lost the equivalent of a loaded Nissan maxima today. So far lost the equivalent of a Nissan GTR this month. #stocks
342 2018-12-24 22:20:02 Even if you invest with 10k it’s still not enough due to the 25k rule(stocks). Still possible but limited.
343 2018-12-24 22:20:00 Law Proffesors commenting on Stocks Market....what's surprising these Doomsday lot... India and Indians recovery...no mention of the recovery proceedings by IT which will net conservatively 2 lac crores...

Apni bathao Coupta..... what ammount did u formalize!
344 2018-12-24 22:19:34 I didn’t say I could pick the perfect bottom. But buying Bitcoin down 80% from highs is nowhere near the same as buying dot-com stocks at their very peak highs in 1999... you agree? that’s all I’m trying to dispute.

Bitcoin is closer to its bottom than dot-coms were in 1999.
345 2018-12-24 22:19:29 Yeh but doesn’t he have a lot of rich friends in stocks who are losing money.
346 2018-12-24 22:19:26 People buying dividend stocks based on current yields need to consider what those yields are likely to go to with the recent declines. You think an oil play is going to still give an 8 or 10 percent yield when their revenue dies?
347 2018-12-24 22:19:03 Dow fell 2.91% & S&P 500 dipped 2.71% in the biggest Christmas Eve declines in the two indices' history. Slump came after stocks last week had their worst week since Great Recession & the last time the market fell so far in Dec was in 1931, the Great Depression. #TrumpRecession
348 2018-12-24 22:18:38 You said they will run out of ammo faster  applying it hurts the bad guys that have them. You forgot your own argument? Bumps stocks don't hurt anything thing. Bad guys do.
349 2018-12-24 22:18:09 The Stock Market crash is sending red flags that there are serious problems. Corporation poured over a Trillion dollars of the money they got with the tax cut to buy shares to prop up the price of their stocks in the last year. The Tax cuts were to a boom for the market.
350 2018-12-24 22:18:01 Stocks were over valued.  Prices driven up because interest rates were so low investors didn’t have many other vehicles to put their cash in.  

Now there’s competition for investment and prices normalize.
351 2018-12-24 22:17:54 Yeah... You were a bit tone deaf, Sean. It's not only the rich people that have money tied up in stocks.
352 2018-12-24 22:17:52 $NKE lost 5.9% today on no news. one of the worst stocks today. interesting times, folks
353 2018-12-24 22:17:51 No better time to buy apple stocks at 146$ per share 
354 2018-12-24 22:17:46 Nawww.. it is just profit taking at the end of the year. stocks were so high.   There will always be War and rumors of war.
355 2018-12-24 22:17:28 The only people losing money are speculators who trade.  401k's are long term investments and down markets mean stocks are on SALE. Buy low sell high. If you are retirement age, you shouldn't even be heavy in stocks. Should be in safer bonds because down markets are CYCLICAL.
356 2018-12-24 22:17:25 If you go back to smash 4 it’s noticeably slower than ultimate. 3 stocks just fits this game
357 2018-12-24 22:17:23 Lol checking pot stocks no less
358 2018-12-24 22:17:14 Can you explain why you claim the economy is great yet stocks are at 22grand? Not buying it!
359 2018-12-24 22:17:02 Gonna put my Christmas bonus into 2 coins and 2 stocks. Suggestions?
360 2018-12-24 22:16:37 End the trade war @realDonaldTrump
Stocks will go up
361 2018-12-24 22:16:33 It is extremely difficult to go against the crowd—to buy when everyone else is selling or has sold, to buy when things look darkest, to buy when so many experts are telling you that stocks in general, or in this particular industry, are risky right now.
John Templeton
362 2018-12-24 22:16:03 Stocks
363 2018-12-24 22:15:38 STILL A GIFT
364 2018-12-24 22:15:30 Tough market for all stocks, it’ll take time before blue chips recover, and other more spec sectors like CBD etc. But the fundamentals are there.
365 2018-12-24 22:14:29 Hahaha it’s December babe not September 
366 2018-12-24 22:14:25 they are shorting stocks, capitalizing on fear and making one last heist.  these people are evil. 

#TrumpResign
367 2018-12-24 22:13:41 Oil is going down far faster than stocks. At this pace WTI is going to 35 in a few weeks.
368 2018-12-24 22:13:33 Took my 401k out of stocks and put it all into bonds and money market funds right around thanksgiving
369 2018-12-24 22:13:19 A record of 35 senior administration positions quit or fired. 17 investigations, federal deficits at record high, stocks in free fall, trade deficit at highest level since 2014. Hiring partisans versus qualified indiv. (DeVos, Perry, Carson, Perdue) will harm the future of the US
370 2018-12-24 22:13:06 Abolish the Fed, Build the Wall, stocks will return and Democrats will STILL hate America! Losers
371 2018-12-24 22:12:32 The malls are closed the other retail outlets are going out of business and stocks have fallen and a depression is on the the way. Thank you Mr. Trump... #ShutdownStories
372 2018-12-24 22:12:32 For the record, I do not expect any substantial bounces to sustain for long at this time. Dependent upon new variables and market conditions, this can change. Based on current state of affairs, I am expecting to maintain my position. Keep vigilant and stay nimble. jmo-    #stocks
373 2018-12-24 22:12:27 Idiot boy have you never heard of shorting stocks?. Only wealthy do iand make a killing.t..
374 2018-12-24 22:11:32 Lol government shut down fucking up the stocks
375 2018-12-24 22:11:01 .@realdonaldtrump “Dow plunges in  worst Christmas Eve for stocks in history…”
376 2018-12-24 22:11:00 Nancy, you may have conveniently forgotten or be applying your Democrat Hypocrite Oath but on Dec 23 2016 the Dow was 19,933 today it is 21,792 an increase of 9.3% while the FED has after 8 years been able to raise the prime 70% to 5.5% to encourage savings versus buying stocks
377 2018-12-24 22:10:50 If this keeps up more people will see @Patreon as untrustworthy and a shady company. More people will leave because of this PR disaster and soon we will see stocks go down to some degree and it will be hard for @Patreon to have a strong recovery.
378 2018-12-24 22:10:35 I haven't held stocks since October 5th.  What'd I miss?
379 2018-12-24 22:10:35 • If you suspect a prowler is outside, remain inside, turn on all the lights and call for help. 
• Maintain stocks of emergency supplies, including non-perishable food, fresh water, candles, torches, portable cooking equipment, a first aid kit and fire extinguishers.
380 2018-12-24 22:10:18 um, rich people are waiting to buy shitloads of stocks at depressed rates come the New Year. middle class people and people on pensions that are invested in the markets (all of them) are losing their money.
381 2018-12-24 22:09:59 How are your #stocks doing?
A) I made money this year
B) No significant change
C) I lost money this year
D) I don't own stocks

382 2018-12-24 22:09:47 What if stocks are tanking because...

stay with me here...

...business elites profit from endless war and cheap illegal labor?
383 2018-12-24 22:09:46 Sorry no room left. But you can go in the stable?
384 2018-12-24 22:09:41 Number of leading stocks today: 7 $SPY $QQQ $FB $GOOG $AMZN $GOOG $AAPL #DailyStkLeaderCount
385 2018-12-24 22:09:31 No, the rich people are out buying stocks while they are at low prices and enjoying the money they have in banks in foreign countries.
386 2018-12-24 22:09:09 Heard "booming economy" so much that when DOW peaked end of Sept, sold 30% of stocks. Good timing. Recession cycle is 10 years.

387 2018-12-24 22:09:03 "Stocks fall, everyone dies." #dnd #economics #happyholidays #merrychristmas
388 2018-12-24 22:08:49 All the rich people are causing this by pulling out and moving to bonds whose yields are finally existant because of the rate increases. Trump yelling at powell is just a distraction as they fleece real America once again. Then they'll buy back stocks cheap in the new year.
389 2018-12-24 22:08:28 @RBReich #Mnuchin could you explain the current market situation, pls. I can’t make the connection between the Fed raising the interest rate and stocks crashing. Shouldn’t the int rate keep the markets stable by controlling runaway inflation?
390 2018-12-24 22:08:17 And a lot of them don’t even own stocks just want to bust Trumps grapes.
391 2018-12-24 22:08:16 They are shitter than they were everywhere I think. 

But however shit our pensions will be, you still don't really want to be much in stocks after the age of 60.
392 2018-12-24 22:08:16 It would seem you don’t pay attention. I have been quite public about some of the lithium stocks I own. I currently hold shares in six lithium companies. However Berkshire Hathaway & Apple are also large holdings given I started buying Berkshire in the 90s & Apple not long after.
393 2018-12-24 22:08:14 Lol. I would argue “rich people” are the ones least effected when the market tumbles because they have plenty of diversified assets outside of stocks. What a moronic tweet.
394 2018-12-24 22:07:56 This mostly isn't Trump, just mob panic like the FOMO buying spree in January. But I agree about not focusing on account values. As Nobel winner Daniel Kahneman said, "If owning stocks is a long-term project for you, following their changes constantly is a very, very bad idea."
395 2018-12-24 22:07:03 Bump Stocks are an accessory and ATF doesn’t have authority to create laws, only enforce what Congress passed. ATF approved over 10 years ago. “Stronger background checks” will be great when the 500,000 felons Eric Holder deleted are added back to the “Do Not Buy” list.
396 2018-12-24 22:06:54 If you have that much cash invested in stocks you should. Woo is me I have too much money.
397 2018-12-24 22:06:32 Outside of major stocks and indices reliable and clean data does not go beyond 20 years at best. 10 of those are QE Crack Conciane highs
398 2018-12-24 22:05:42 Remember tech stocks exacerbated that decline in the markets and I'm almost certain Santa will climb down everybody's chimney with some type of tech gadget this year which will have a positive effect on our next earning's season reporting.
399 2018-12-24 22:05:14 my brother and I had a debate just the other day about whether stocks are "liquid" wealth or not. Both a theoretical debate and a purely speculative one as neither of us has a single concrete notion about such things.
400 2018-12-24 22:05:10 Brings a million logical questions about bump stocks to a gun fight.
401 2018-12-24 22:05:02 @realDonaldTrump thank you for being the stupidest president ever. Because of you stocks are dropping and everyone is losing money. Just what we need for the holidays...NOT!
402 2018-12-24 22:05:02 NQ rallied 60% in 16 months.  That in itself set us up for this.  When stocks go parabolic (or anything else for that matter) the slightest inkling can collapse it.  You are wasting your time looking for causes.  It’s 1929/1987/2000 redux ; charts identical.  Fear/greed.
403 2018-12-24 22:04:32 Found a liquor store that stocks 375ml bottles of bourbon and it sure is an hour away
404 2018-12-24 22:04:28 Stock market crashing maybe I can finally grab some stocks
405 2018-12-24 22:04:24 Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) price at close, 2018-12-24, is 295.39. #teslamotors #tesla #stocks #NASDAQ #elonmusk
406 2018-12-24 22:03:48 I think they will do something to, but still probably too early. However I was thinking stocks made a new high as well earlier in the year, but too many charts are broken. I think $ for now pops but I own gold as well. We will know very soon
407 2018-12-24 22:03:30 Stocks going down
408 2018-12-24 22:03:22 I gained in my stocks!!
409 2018-12-24 22:02:58 A good stocking stuffer this Christmas is energy stocks - just buy a few shares of companies that will be around in a decade and forget about them - they are cheap for a reason but a value long term 
410 2018-12-24 22:02:38 Thanks to @realDonaldTrump stocks last week had their worst week since the Great Recession a decade ago, and the last time the market fell so far in December was in 1931, during the Great Depression #trumprecession @FoxNews @PressSec @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi

413 2018-12-24 22:02:13 Shudda invest in some Kozmo tickets like stocks 
414 2018-12-24 22:01:43 So when stocks are doing well it's because of you and now that they are hitting the bottom it's the Fed's fault?
415 2018-12-24 22:01:38 The strange part is watching Trump supporters spin this crash into a good thing. 

"At least you could buy stocks really low and sell high."  

When?
416 2018-12-24 22:01:31 ... also you don't have to be rich to own stocks. I earned some shares through my company as part of my comp package but certainly nothing crazy.
417 2018-12-24 22:01:17 You meant Bull market. We'd love to blame him for a bear market (kidding)! You are of course correct that stocks have a lot of volatility, and that the president has very little or no impact the vast majority of the time.
418 2018-12-24 22:01:11 His name is prob "I'm too sexy for my stocks" or some other humble moniker.
419 2018-12-24 22:00:53 You wanted this @SenSchumer . Millions voted for President Trump. You hate him. Enough said. I don't blame him for stocks crashing. And I had plenty to lose. I'm sure you, Hollywood,  Nancy, and gang are proud of yourselves.
420 2018-12-24 22:00:31 Why are you entertaining UF fans?-- they have relations with their cousins and buy stocks in NattyLite. Gross.

424 2018-12-24 21:59:57 A reminder to everyone that stocks are a long term investment. If you need the money sooner than 5 years, stocks are not for you. 

#stocks #StockMarket #investing #TrumpCrash
425 2018-12-24 21:59:53 And just a whole rejection of the fact that the economy intertwines everything. Enron collapsing closed down K-Marts because a large portion of their holdings were in Enron stocks.
426 2018-12-24 21:59:32 The Fed sucks and while you are complaining about the stock market, smart investors are buying up the cheap stocks.
427 2018-12-24 21:59:27 Lemme know when other stocks are available
428 2018-12-24 21:59:07 Market, most extreme oversold posture since October '87; before that October '29; we rally Wednesday or there will be a >20% one day event before year end; unlike '08; '01 '81-2; '73-4; 69-70;  no publicly revealed reason for decline other than the overvalued condition of stocks.
429 2018-12-24 21:58:41 Something tells me Lindsay owns a bunch of defense stocks.

430 2018-12-24 21:58:37 Ok so smarter guys than me like @JulianMI2 have said there is a severe shortage of $ due to essentially a margin call. If trump devalued the $ against gold, he maybe wouldn't need the fed to print again to bail out stocks. Idk I'm thinking if he feels cornered who knows?
431 2018-12-24 21:58:32 Hey rich, stock market goes up and down all the time.  That’s why stocks are long term investments.
432 2018-12-24 21:58:29 Yes it is, many stocks are looking attractive.
433 2018-12-24 21:58:21 When stocks go down by big % /day, I'm as skeptical as when they go up like that.Some are justified and overdue, many others are following along w/ the herd. That's when solid individ stock picking can make gains MUCH faster than index funds. #StockMarket #stockpicking #investing
434 2018-12-24 21:58:11 Chinese stocks up though........hmmmm, Trump and GOP BLEW it by not passing the TPP trade deal with many Asian nations excluding China...would have boosted our economy and given us big leverage to use with China
435 2018-12-24 21:57:50 Noooo don’t sell yet, it’s only a loss if he sold at 81 he should have most of his money in conservative accounts hardly nothing in stocks
436 2018-12-24 21:56:39 i don't know if instability and crazy makes stocks go up as well as down. seems like he has a lot of control for down. but, up is maybe harder.
437 2018-12-24 21:56:37 Earlier today, my cousin asked me about investing in stocks. I am very biased with my views on growing money - investing in public markets is the way to go. However - one needs a strong stomach and immense courage to navigate the uncertainty today. My advice was to stick to bonds
438 2018-12-24 21:56:34 This is who we sell penny stocks to

@JordanBelfortNY
439 2018-12-24 21:56:31 Seen a lot of news about the stock market falling. Friendly reminder that it’s mainly an economic indicator of the wealthy and those who actually own stocks. For me and many others it doesn’t meant jack shit about our economic prosperity.
440 2018-12-24 21:56:28 So many technical traders calling for SPX 1500 without having any fundamental explanation, stocks don’t fall that hard without a fundamental reason to. Technicals are fine short term but i don’t trust it long term
441 2018-12-24 21:56:12 This is drama queen bullshit. Anybody close to retirement have already moved their 401Ks from stocks to interest bearing instruments. If not they should sue their financial advisor for malpractice.
442 2018-12-24 21:56:08 You’ve made Putin very happy, Comrade. Out of Syria, Matthias gone, stocks plummeting, government shut down. You are a scourge on our nation!
443 2018-12-24 21:55:49 Not yet. Stocks are not the worry for a financial crisis - very liquid market that can sort itself out, even if painfully.

It's when the credit markets seize up again on counter-party fears. Or a bank run, likely precipitated by a sovereign debt default and/or currency crisis.
444 2018-12-24 21:55:25 Comparing stocks indices one trading day before Xmas across years. #SavedYouAClick (inspired by @jposhaughnessy ). 

What an odd way of slicing the data. Why don’t you show largest one day moves and see where today lands?
445 2018-12-24 21:55:07 STOCKS SUFFER WORSE XMAS EVE EVER@realDonaldTrump
446 2018-12-24 21:54:43 I completely disagree with that. Prior to 1930 crash financial assets were pretty open. That’s how the taxi driver thing came up. You could buy stocks from your taxi driver or shoe shine boy. Most were fakes or frauds. Same thing we have in crypto today. LEARN HISTORY
447 2018-12-24 21:53:22 If they are close to retirement then they shouldn't have been investing aggressively is stocks, right? Closer to retirement age don't you move to more steady vehicles?
448 2018-12-24 21:53:13 Fucking retards don't understand that rich people buy options and tank stocks just to make money out of little investors that don't have mainframes running robots 24/7 to make trades according to algorithms in order to tank stuff while making millions on another trade...
449 2018-12-24 21:53:08 Trace contracts with DHS CIA with Jeannie Skeens and family. Trace stocks Neuralink Frontier Services Group Serco Raytheon Sierra Nevada etc insider trading. Profiting from torture....OK SOUNDS CRAZY..BUT I HAD A CONTACT FROM RAYTHEON TOO..SAN DIEGO..COULD PICK HER OUT OF LINE UP
450 2018-12-24 21:53:05 It's only a loss on paper until the stocks are sold.
451 2018-12-24 21:52:56 Investment in my brand and then in stocks (butcoin) to be specific
452 2018-12-24 21:52:26 like half of US households own stocks.  rich disproportionally lose money, but who cares.
453 2018-12-24 21:52:26 if you're like me, you watched US and international stocks enter a #bearMarket today. if you're also like me, you rightly decided to cut a few losses and trade your leftover fiat for $ETC, $LTC and/or $ETH. #justSayin… @coinbase | @CoinbasePro
454 2018-12-24 21:52:25 I would say that regular people haven't lost their retirement unless they are about to retire soon (when it's advised to switch stocks etc to a money market account so volatility won't wipe you out). Regular people can keep buying stocks in 401K, don't sell anything, ride it out.
455 2018-12-24 21:52:11 Stocks worldwide posted an 8th straight decline Monday as investors ignored Trump administration attempts to reinforce confidence & the U.S. President called the Federal Reserve the “only problem our economy has.”
456 2018-12-24 21:52:10 Better listen to all the news sources and not just your advisors at FOX. There is no depth to the disrespect for your administration. Even Conservatives are beginning to notice, but it took the DROP in their STOCKS to grab them by their pocketbooks
457 2018-12-24 21:52:00 RT @luke_beller: You have $10,000. You can only invest in crypto or stocks and you have to hold for 5yrs. Retweet for crypto. Favorite for stocks.
458 2018-12-24 21:51:46 BS, but we can say Thank You Donald for screwing up our 491k and stocks and retirement plans!  You are just so smart aren’t ya, pitiful liar!!!
459 2018-12-24 21:51:42 Santa is not liking stocks this year!
460 2018-12-24 21:51:15 Can’t figure out if these fake news dummies really that stupid or they got paid to be the laughing stocks ?
461 2018-12-24 21:51:09 This is an awful way to look at it. Many people who aren’t rich also own stocks, and many of those people actually depend on their 401(k) for eventual retirement.
462 2018-12-24 21:50:48 #DowJones dropping again. I wonder if there is any way to turn all these @Target gift cards into stocks so I can buy low. #MerryChristmas to me maybe.
463 2018-12-24 21:50:19 Note 2 my kids - when you both asked about asset allocation a year or so ago I told u 60-40 stocks/short term debt. The plan was to go 100% stocks on drops, you should move half the FI to stocks, that will get u 80-20, put the rest in stocks if we end up down 40%,Merry Christmas
464 2018-12-24 21:50:13 Bruhhhh my stocks SHIT 
465 2018-12-24 21:50:08 It's almost as if the GOP tax cut had something to do with it. Maybe disproportionately cutting taxes for the top 1% earners has a negative effect on 99% of the economy *gasp*. Maybe they did stock buybacks and then sold those stocks without adding any company value *gasp*.
466 2018-12-24 21:50:06 This is my last advise on this issue get out of stocks and go to bonds immediately!
467 2018-12-24 21:49:59 Exactly what I think. I lost out on the market run-up because I figured Trump would tank the economy and market would fall apart when all the Trump/GOP illegalities began unravelling, so took my retirement out of stocks when he was elected. Got out too early, but I'm glad I'm out
468 2018-12-24 21:49:49 Sharpen pencils. Avoid naughty stocks and buy nice stocks with quality and reasonable valuations. Empty the coal from your stockings too. Don’t forget technical confirmation of entries.
469 2018-12-24 21:49:11 Almost all of the gains in the #stocks from the last 2 years are gone. #ThanksObama
470 2018-12-24 21:48:47 Put some stocks in those stockings!
471 2018-12-24 21:48:44 Out of stocks into Treasury's. Sooner or later the 'fear' will subside and the quants will recalibrate.
472 2018-12-24 21:48:41 Maybe he meant pass a tax bill and your stocks will tank.
473 2018-12-24 21:48:24 Also “Stocks are also on track for their worst December since 1931, during the depths of the Great Depression. “
474 2018-12-24 21:48:01 Way to look on the bright side Liz.  I'd rather have the 50K "paper loss" back.  Plus, it's still bad news for oil stocks.  Can't time it though, just gotta buy sound investments that we're comfortable holding.
475 2018-12-24 21:47:58 NY Times is reporting that stocks are “on track for their worst year since 2008 and the largest December decline since the 1930s.” It pains me to say that Lil’ Donny really IS the best . . . at making things the worst. Congratulations Baby-man!!! #MoronInChief #ResignTrump
476 2018-12-24 21:47:53 and this is the kind of market to make a lot of money on the upside over the next 24 months

dollar cost averaging large cap stocks with high dividend yields is the way to go

If speculating, I'd buy shares in a company like Netflix because they're a game changer.
477 2018-12-24 21:47:53 I don't understand that much about economics, but from what I can tell: stocks are bad, yet the economy is good, so good that the Fed is trying to make it a little less good. Well I'm sure they'll all figure it out.
478 2018-12-24 21:47:43 Well good. You are getting it. Just think for a moment, if the stocks plunge where does the money go? Gold? Silver? Crypto? If I were a rich man, id my hedge bets in all three.
479 2018-12-24 21:47:16 All you #TrumpSupporters involved in the Markets must be so happy you elected a business man who gave you #TrumpChristmasShutdown #TrumpTariffs
#TrumpDeficit #ChaosChristmas
#realDonaldTrump will fix it, keep on saying & believing it & I'll buy your penny stocks when he's gone
480 2018-12-24 21:47:12 Here's something to consider: if the economy keeps doing well while stocks continue to tank Democrats should love this. Usually relatively well-off people own equities, while the poor aren't as exposed and more likely to benefit from other aspects of a strong economy.
481 2018-12-24 21:47:02 I dont mean to say that like i currently do stocks lol I've just looked into it before
482 2018-12-24 21:46:53 I remember in senior year economics class we had to “buy” 5 different stocks and if you made no profit at the end of the year you automatically failed the class
483 2018-12-24 21:45:38 Ever bought or sold stocks? This is typically one of those times people buy.
484 2018-12-24 21:45:34 I gave up a 401k for a self directed SEP IRA for this very reason.  I got lucky and sold my positions between July and October believing Trump's trade wars were going to hurt corporate bottom lines.

I value invest in stocks, exchange traded funds & REITs with high div yields
485 2018-12-24 21:45:33 And these elites or purposely sinking or stock market trying to make Trump look bad..... These companies are making plenty of money there's no reason for the stocks to be in the tank
486 2018-12-24 21:45:23 How’s buying an asset that is down 80% from its highs (bitcoin today) the same thing as buying an asset sitting at the very peak of its highs (dot-com stocks in 1999)?
487 2018-12-24 21:45:01 So you're saying you would give up your money earning stocks if you had them?
488 2018-12-24 21:44:59 $stocks in the end fundamentals always win.Some folks combine Fundamentals w/technicals.OK if that's ur game. 
Folks who rely 100% on technicals generally get wiped out. Technicians didn't c this coming & still trying 2 use charts 2 predict outcomes.charts r worthless in this mkt
489 2018-12-24 21:44:52 Since Mnuchin probably passed on insider information to his entire swamp, they're all probably short selling stocks, making even more millions, screwing over American workers, and toasting in cheer!   #SwampRats
490 2018-12-24 21:44:45 There will likely be a slight rebound as greedy investors try to cut their losses with cheap deals... Then the bottom will drop out. Miserly boards will look for old solutions in job cuts and find nothing but the consequences of their trickle down actions. #stocks
491 2018-12-24 21:44:38 I have to laugh at a certain person. I will not mention names but you know... Your retirement has been great you say ... How does it feel now that the stocks are all down as the worst in history for Dec and all gains gone for the year.. Not so smug now are ya!!!
492 2018-12-24 21:44:21 Wise lost so much in biotech stocks he bought tweety's lifetime package for $5000. I thought you knew this. he bets tweety's plays and loses even more
493 2018-12-24 21:44:17 Stocks and savings wiped out, Government is closed, we are on our knees to Saudi A and N Korea and can even say Merry Christmas. All this winning
494 2018-12-24 21:44:04 They even got the drug stocks...the damn drug stocks. #markets
495 2018-12-24 21:43:48 He's doing this as we all mentioned he had been tweeting all day so couldn't have been working and his tweets caused the stocks to plummet. He then went quiet for hours and then took a random picture of his eyes appearing closed looking at a piece of paper. Classic
496 2018-12-24 21:43:38 I sat through the horror movie that was 2008-2009.  I held two stocks that went to zero...our bank failed...the fifty-year old, multi-state business I worked for liquidated.

Trump is producing the sequel right now.
497 2018-12-24 21:43:23 Year 2018 was the worst for European stocks since 2018. It is great time to diversify to the best cryptos. I wuold not recommend 95% of them.
498 2018-12-24 21:43:13 Duuuuuude I almost took 2 stocks on MVD. I played like crap though and I could've done better. Still cool though.
499 2018-12-24 21:43:12 MARKETS ARE IN DEPRESSION? STOCKS AGAIN ON XMAS EVE! DOW DOWN -653 TO 22792, NASDAQ -140 to 6192. WORSE MONTHLY POINTS DROP EVER. IN 10 WEEKS, DOW DROP 5000 PTS. THATS LOSING ABOUT 1/4 OF YOUR MONEY? THERE GOES RETIREMENT?  
500 2018-12-24 21:43:09 Got to find a store that stocks them in South East Melbourne.
501 2018-12-24 21:42:58 How big a decline in stocks do we need to have the Fed cut next week?
502 2018-12-24 21:42:48 My feel good message for Xmas. All that money you are losing in AIM crap, tonight you would be losing roughly the same % if you owned most of the biggest stocks in the world. We are all clowns.
503 2018-12-24 21:42:22 Trump banned bump stocks recently so you can't just blame the dems
504 2018-12-24 21:42:09 SDKJFADSFJK SHE WILL LEAD THE COMPANY INTO A GOLDEN AGE,,,, kirby will dominate the markets,, better invest in haltmann stocks while you still can
505 2018-12-24 21:42:04 Just to make it clear, not only the wealthy hold stocks. And your take demonstrates a lack of understanding that tearing it all down affects the working class & middle class first & most.
506 2018-12-24 21:41:58 S&P 500 P/E still 20% above its long-run average.  This says nothing about individual stocks but a lot about the fact that, on the whole, the equity markets are not cheap.
507 2018-12-24 21:41:33 I wonder how much the Trump family lost this month with Stocks
508 2018-12-24 21:41:27 Why do you blame trump for stock market decline - the only people responsible are those selling stocks!
509 2018-12-24 21:41:09 Lol... borrow fees are what percentage of all shortable stocks??
510 2018-12-24 21:40:34 Careful your baseless bigotry is showing. To the contrary, we DO have stocks, IRAs and 401Ks which is partly why we are so happy with the job he’s doing.
511 2018-12-24 21:40:25 Reading Fintwit and seeing all the comments about the lack of bids...of course there are no bids, it's Dec 24. People want to enjoy turkey with their loved ones, not worry about stocks. They'll be back. Myself, I'm positioned where I couldn't care less if $ES is up or down 100.
512 2018-12-24 21:40:20 You would think these clowns would learn after EA stocks dropped 45% in 2018. Doofuses
513 2018-12-24 21:40:06 Two ex-Googlers want to replace your fish and chip shop with a camera unit that only stocks one product per day.
514 2018-12-24 21:40:05 You know they'll be fine, right

They don't need to sell those stocks to live, and in fact have often spare cash to buy the dip and wait for them to go back up
515 2018-12-24 21:40:01 #DowJones The recipients of Trump's tax giveaways want stocks pushed lower so they can do their buybacks before year end. Otherwise, you'd hear the rich screaming and making phone calls to end the chaos in DC.

518 2018-12-24 21:39:30 At the root is households’ record exposure to stock market. Economy too tethered to stocks. Steve Blitz at TS Lombard has done extensive work in this arena comparing to only two other times we’ve been close to this exposed, 1968 & 1999.
519 2018-12-24 21:39:10 Rationality sux! Upon this mantra resteth the Trump bubble! How about this wish for 2019: meatless product stocks surge on ever better cultured meat. Why kill for the yummy goodness?
520 2018-12-24 21:38:54 Said no one. Most america dont invest in stocks.stop
521 2018-12-24 21:38:44 Clearly you don’t own stocks. You should sell if you do cuz auditing the fed will bury the market.
522 2018-12-24 21:38:24 All the stocks are on sale for Christmas everyone! It’s truly a Christmas miracle #MerryChristmas
523 2018-12-24 21:38:00 I sold stocks and still lost 85 on my other ones. 
524 2018-12-24 21:37:27 You sure do whine and complain a lot for someone with as much power as you claim to have. Seems like the world is realizing how much you suck as a President since your not getting what you want, stocks are crashing. #Resign #TrumpShutown #TrumpCrash #TrumpResign
525 2018-12-24 21:36:51 #stocks I don't call folks bagholders cause its just rude. HOWEVER, I violate this 1 time since I'm included. ANYONE WHO HAS $ IN A 401K OR INVESTED IN STOCKS HAS BECOME A BAGHOLDER COURTESY OF OUR SUPREME(I MEAN ELECTED) LEADER. THIS WILL TAKE YEARS TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE
526 2018-12-24 21:36:34 Are you intentionally crashing the market in order to buy stocks at a lower price? You are such a con man. #TrumpResign
527 2018-12-24 21:36:14 But what if 4 stocks
528 2018-12-24 21:36:03 This post was made by 3 stocks gang
529 2018-12-24 21:35:53 I suppose one upside to the financial markets taking a steaming dump this past month is that stocks and mutual funds are a bargain now. I feel bad for retirees who haven't rebalanced their portfolios, though. Yikes.
530 2018-12-24 21:35:38 While many do not own stocks directly most have some stocks in their retirement plan
531 2018-12-24 21:35:28 James Bond tries to stop a bizarre former MI6 agent, who is planning to use brainwashing to distribute stocks.
532 2018-12-24 21:34:52 Buy some stocks and hold on, the market will bounce back.
533 2018-12-24 21:34:11 I don't think you get to say that we have the best economy and the stocks are doing great but then blame others when it's not...
534 2018-12-24 21:34:09 Your alone in the White House because you are too embarrassed to go to Mara-a-Lago and face your rich friends who want to know what the hell happened to their stocks.
535 2018-12-24 21:34:09 Why no one gives credit to Nancy being the next SOH as a reason stocks have fallen so low?
536 2018-12-24 21:34:07 Please investigate whether the Trump family is short selling stocks today. This just looks like classic white collar robbery.
537 2018-12-24 21:33:26 I swear to god If Warioware is legal I will circle camp everyone and take everyones STOCKS AT 60% EVERYTIME
538 2018-12-24 21:33:24 no just memes. same with stocks.
539 2018-12-24 21:33:23 Investors never dealt with someone like him before, but they are a greedy bunch. Don't give up hope on the market, once the Dems control the house they will look at him as tamed and start to snap up stocks at bargain prices they could only dream about a year ago. Be ready to buy.
540 2018-12-24 21:33:08 @jimcramer Take responsibility for your horrific recommendation of FANG stocks, throughout the summer into November, AND admit the problem is not Jay Powell (who lacks nuance and is illiterate) but Trump, an overwhelmed media megalomaniac, elected in accident.
541 2018-12-24 21:33:05 Guess he will somehow put the blame on Obama and or Hillary!!!
The market is making me feel ill!!
I am an older woman and depend on my stocks- and they are
 In the dumper!!!
And here he is worried about the stupid slat wall etc!!
How can anyone respect him?
542 2018-12-24 21:32:34 @realDonaldTrump Way to Go!!!!!!  IF only you knew economics....

The slump came after the stocks last week had their worst week since the Great Recession a decade ago, and the last time the market fell so far in December was in 1931, during the Great Depression.
543 2018-12-24 21:32:30 Should I invest in stocks while they extremely low like this?
544 2018-12-24 21:32:16 Like a dog abused by its owner, that dog eventually bites back.
Trump voters, you may not have stocks, but your employers do. When they lose, you lose your jobs. You’ve got realize the whole “he’s like me and looks out for me” was pure BS. We’re all Americans, he’s not one of us.
545 2018-12-24 21:32:00 It seems “deja vu” again. The stocks were down during the democrats ruling, up during republicans and now down again.
546 2018-12-24 21:31:56 Imagine playing 2 stocks in ultimate
547 2018-12-24 21:31:51 Quick update: I did it. I shifted my retirement funds more into stocks. I'm not recommending this, as one isn't supposed to speculate with retirement funds and I'm not an expert, but I haven't felt this positive in many months and I got it right last time, in December 2017. ...
548 2018-12-24 21:31:10 As I expected  the stocks market GONE WITH THE WIND 
Who to blame he is the only one the Madman the Wallman, the crazy man
the man who wants to make America full of Sh*it  ...again   
this is the beginning
we will see Yellow Vests soon in the streets  

Comment vas-tu je t'aime
549 2018-12-24 21:31:02 Hmm, just like the other stocks he manipulates through tweeting, or maybe I'm cynical.
550 2018-12-24 21:30:46 I don't have any stocks, so I'm happy.
551 2018-12-24 21:30:24 Is he shorting stocks to enrich his personal finances?
552 2018-12-24 21:30:24 - fed lowers interest rates to prevent inflation
- Trump overreacts and considers firing Mnuchin because if the market does poorly he has nothing going for him
- irrational investors overreact because Trump overreacted
- US stocks hit 20 month low

You can't not blame Trump here
553 2018-12-24 21:30:16 Get ready for the bell on 12/26/18. Have you heard "buy low, sell high?" Well, now it's time to buy, buy, buy. #Stocks #FreeAdvice #ImNotAnExpert.

Or, just hang on to what you've got, don't sell!
554 2018-12-24 21:30:07 Im calling, selfish greed with a dollop of stupid with numpty Trump.
. Market has put too much value on the earnings tho ,stocks will correct. but the vultures will prop it up until we get a catastrophic collapse in value.
555 2018-12-24 21:30:04 U.S. stocks plunged on Monday in their worst day of Christmas Eve trading ever, as the S&P 500 entered a bear market.
556 2018-12-24 21:29:59 It's not a coincidence, Tim. There's a NDA in place at retail and Big Pharma level. Stocks are being piled and patients rationed; eventually, prescriptions will be subject to arbitrary substitution by retail pharmacies.
557 2018-12-24 21:29:45 The Dow was 19,780 when Trump took office.  It should be back at that amount before his 2nd anniversary in office.  Glad I don't own stocks so I can LMFAO.
558 2018-12-24 21:29:17 Plus this isn’t them losing anything tangible. Unless they sell their stocks they still own the underlying property it’s just worth less money. That value recovers quickly once the thousand money managers calm down and change their outlook.
559 2018-12-24 21:28:57 For who or what @BobCorker, your portfolio of defense stocks, or your overlords investment in Genie Energy.  Hypocrite & #EnemyOfThePeople
560 2018-12-24 21:28:53 I have a local source who stocks up for me :-)
561 2018-12-24 21:28:47 Federally, bump stocks and certain assault weapons were banned.  I don’t know the particulars in each of the states, but many enacted tougher, more thorough background checks. The gun reform majority in the House (all endorsed by this group) is planning major reforms in Jan.
562 2018-12-24 21:28:46 Bear market is over after #Trump leaves office.  #POTUS creates uncertainty for #stocks.  @CNBC @jimcramer @elonmusk #bitcoin will now be safe haven for 2019 as traders flock and push price up @VitalikButerin #ETHEREUM @elerianm Bear markets average 2 yrs.
563 2018-12-24 21:28:45 The fund that manages your 401k made money today by shorting stocks, profitting when they go down. You've invested your money in something you don't understand, you will forever be taken advantage of. It's not a nice game they play, but ignorance is the only way they can continue
564 2018-12-24 21:28:30 Imagine playing 2 stocks
565 2018-12-24 21:28:23 I have a great #stockmarket tip for you, @realDonaldTrump. If u want stocks to stop plunging, just resign & it will go back to a bull market overnight. You can incease your wealth & eliminate a lot of stress in one fell swoop. #p2 #resist #FBR
566 2018-12-24 21:28:12 *extremely rich asshole voice*

567 2018-12-24 21:28:06 L'argent ça pollue. En tour cas dès que des gros montant pour des gros stocks sont mis en jeu. Les libéraux comrendront!
568 2018-12-24 21:27:57 They worked exactly how they were designed to work.  Corporations bought back stocks and rich old white men got richer.  They totally worked.
569 2018-12-24 21:27:48 Stocks will realign based on profits and growth soon enough. I’m not worried. Bought more stock today, as a matter of fact.
570 2018-12-24 21:27:33 How are his stocks doing?
571 2018-12-24 21:27:20 Yep,note the language used by the Bindles, Stocks, etc....attacking the word 'Queer'. This opens the door to attacking LGB people (especially teenagers) on the same basis as they attack trans ones.

Basically Stage #2, probably start next year.
572 2018-12-24 21:26:51 Stocks are on pace for their WORST December since the Great Depression. On Friday, the Dow ended its WORST week since 2008. The Nasdaq is in a bear market. A lot to be proud of? What a piss poor management job that YOU get all the credit for. Embarrassing!
573 2018-12-24 21:26:49 We make military leaders divest themselves of stocks and other conflicts.  He needs to do the same!
574 2018-12-24 21:26:35 Watching Fox makes me ill, but in this case, they have a decent narrative. Stocks went up because Trump promised business friendly policies and he won. Now, Dems won and the business friendly policies may be stopped or even reversed.
575 2018-12-24 21:26:20 The only problem America has is YOU! YOU and your inability for logic and sane decisions are the cause of plummeting stocks and a weak dollar.
576 2018-12-24 21:26:14 Can @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems investigate (next week) whether Mnuchin passed insider trading info. to his wall street and corporate cronies to short sell stocks, make more millions, and cause more crisis?  @CNN @MSNBC @washingtonpost @nytimes @dailykos @Maddow @AliVelshi
577 2018-12-24 21:26:13 Remember tech stocks exacerbated that decline in the markets and I'm almost certain Santa will climb down everybody's chimney with some type of tech gadget this year which will have a positive effect on our next earning's season reporting.
578 2018-12-24 21:25:59 Corporations used the tax cuts for massive stock buy backs instead of investing in workers or benefits. These buybacks artificially inflate the worth of stocks allowing shareholders to profit temporarily. But eventually the value will drop when the bubble bursts. Then stocks tank
579 2018-12-24 21:25:23 I feel like this is all just due to 3 stocks rather than Ultimate itself, but regardless of what it is I love it lol
580 2018-12-24 21:25:00 So distressing to read this on @AP: Stocks are also on track for their worst December since 1931, during the depths of the Great Depression. Merry Christmas everyone
581 2018-12-24 21:24:33 Can @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems investigate (next week) whether Mnuchin passed insider trading info. to his wall street and corporate cronies to short sell stocks, make more millions, and cause more crisis?
582 2018-12-24 21:24:24 You adding stocks? Falling knife?
583 2018-12-24 21:24:18 So...
The stock market was climbing;
Trump tweets about the Fed Chair;
Stocks Plummeted.
584 2018-12-24 21:23:29 Why are my stocks greatly dropping? It's 
not a terrific situation
585 2018-12-24 21:23:26 My Top Stocks for 2019:
1. DIS
2. PYPL
3. PENN
4. TAP
5. FB
586 2018-12-24 21:22:50 By the way, i only handle my own investments so i am not a professional. I just learned a lot in the last 20 years of doing it myself.  I moved from 80/20 stocks/cash in may to 20/80 in September.
587 2018-12-24 21:22:45 Just check who’s going to buy back all the discount stocks when at all time low
588 2018-12-24 21:22:41 Idk if this is a Belmont thing, but I really don't get this whole "A lead in Ultimate actually feels like a lead, unlike in S4." In this game I feel fine if I'm down to stocks at kill percent and worried when I'm up a stock. In S4 if I was down by 12% I was sweating
589 2018-12-24 21:22:41 Stocks on sale.  Dow will be near or at new all time high by election 2020.
590 2018-12-24 21:22:32 Merry Christmas Eve to all, even the haters and losers. I hope you don't own stocks, because then you're one of the losers.
591 2018-12-24 21:22:30 #Dividend paying stocks have a higher yield when #equities fall in price. The dividend yield or interest is obtained by dividing the dividend by the price. While falling stocks prices are bad, the yields do improve & may suggest holding a stock that is profitable looking forward.
592 2018-12-24 21:22:15 Stock market is a contained bubble in itself. Most of the stock price rises over 5 years was companies borrowing from the Fed at 0.1% to buy back their own stocks and inflate the value of the company. Fed now raising rates means we'll have a downward run as the market corrects
593 2018-12-24 21:22:14 It seems #Putin investment in USA is recently paying off bigly . My investment in the S and P 500, not so much. #TrumpShutdown #stocks
594 2018-12-24 21:22:14 @newsdesk why?  Cause all stocks are worthless pieces of cyberspace.  It’s all built on hope and faith  and when that’s gone what’s left?
595 2018-12-24 21:22:05 Dumb take. Stocks have never not been up over any time horizon more than 8 or 9 years. Usually substantially up over any given 15+ year timeframe. Always significantly up over any 20 year period.
596 2018-12-24 21:22:02 Rep. Lieu, can @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats investigate (next week) whether Mnuchin shared insider info. with his swamp cronies and they are all short selling their stocks?
597 2018-12-24 21:22:00 The stockings were hung by the chimney with care 
and Donald was settled down in his chair 
watching for compliments doled out on Fox
 while the market is crashing and destroying our stocks!

 (Feel free to add the next verse.)
598 2018-12-24 21:21:49 Sure, we are well into the bear market.  The broader market never participated in the rally before October.  With the breakdown of the momentum stocks, it's raining hell on all other stocks too.  I can see stocks which are trading at 18% dividend ratio.  Pathetic market.
599 2018-12-24 21:21:46 Stocks are on track for their worst December since 1931, during the depths of the Great Depression. #Tariffs #TaxReform = Backfired on you. Trickle-down is a joke...on you, and we're paying for it.  #TrumpResign #ResignTrump
600 2018-12-24 21:21:33 #DowJones  This is probably a good thing, considering that the only way to guarantee returns is through violence, physical or economic.  Maybe green stocks will keep going up and oil and war will continue to plummet.  Happy Holidays!
601 2018-12-24 21:21:30 But what is it since Trump became POTUS?  And when the stock market was cranking, the left said the stock market means nothing about the economy.  What to believe ?  I think I'll continue to buy stocks.
602 2018-12-24 21:21:19 So which of Trump’s mates shorted stocks recently?
603 2018-12-24 21:21:16 I don't think the #308 commodity itself is, but I agree the U stocks definitely are...gems like $UUUU have been on fire sale the last few days.
604 2018-12-24 21:21:14 I’m shorting stocks that have merger announcements in past 6 months.
605 2018-12-24 21:21:13 Stocks? Way too early
606 2018-12-24 21:20:24 @markminervini HI Mark.Thanks for your 5mo trend on @MarketSmith . its a great resource .The amount of stocks drops as does the market. Have you ever looked at the quantity of ideas as a gauge to market sentiment? have you ever looked at reversing your criteria for short ideas?ty
607 2018-12-24 21:20:13 You won't be around that long.  Stocks are on track for their worst December since 1931, during the depths of the Great Depression.  Resign.
608 2018-12-24 21:20:05 Most stocks  are down some more in the shortened after hours session this late afternoon.
609 2018-12-24 21:19:40 No offense to @JasonIsbell, of whom I’m a huge fan back from DBT days, but why do we assume he - or any other celebrity - know anything about the stock market? I’ve got 3x more education in Econ but don’t think I’m qualified to confidently tell this many followers how stocks work
610 2018-12-24 21:18:58 DOW just went down 650 points and my dad ain’t happy rn. Hell...stocks he’s invested for me going down
611 2018-12-24 21:18:55 IN A #DEPRESSION ! #STOCKS FLOGGED ON XMAS EVE! DOW DOWN -653 TO 22792, NASDAQ -140 to 6192. WORSE MONTHLY POINTS DROP EVER. IN 10 WEEKS, DOW DROP 5000 PTS. THATS LOSING ABOUT 1/4 OF YOUR MONEY? THERE GOES RETIREMENT?  
612 2018-12-24 21:18:42 Do you think the #government will have to result to "Quantitative Easing" at some point or inject #money into the #Market using some other method ? 

#QE #quantitativeeasing #fed #federalreserve #trump #tradewars #bearmarket #bitcoin #oil #brexit #stocks #tariffs #shutdown #wall
613 2018-12-24 21:18:35 A five hundredth of a percent increase in inflation is hardly a reason to raise interest rates. GOP doesn’t control the value of stocks. Investors do. However sudden rises in interest rates will cause investors to move to more secure investments...
614 2018-12-24 21:18:26 Well one thing is for sure, pot stocks are recession proof. $CRON
615 2018-12-24 21:17:46 What if “as you get older” a volatile stock market depletes the value of your life savings and you have nothing to convert to bonds?

Invest in stocks - wipes away on a whim
Invest in bonds - insufficient growth 

It’s almost like it’s all bad!
616 2018-12-24 21:17:25 I never said they could not and that statement is true. When the Federal lowers the interest rate investors get out of the bond market and buy stocks.
617 2018-12-24 21:17:23 Eighty percent of Americans together own just 8 percent of all stocks. So, no.
618 2018-12-24 21:17:17 Do yourself a huge favor, don't panic and pull out of stocks in your 401K or otherwise. It's a downturn, these happen. If you are actively putting money still into your 401K, I'd suggest putting all of it into stocks for a while. take advantage of cheap prices. It will go up.
619 2018-12-24 21:16:56 The rich will be fine they'll use this as an excuse for layoffs .. stocks going down is the only time you will anything "trickle down "
620 2018-12-24 21:16:27 Merriment will be limited given the nosedive in stocks.
621 2018-12-24 21:16:18 When @niyatishah_ opens her stocks app for the first time and says "who's Dow Jones?"
622 2018-12-24 21:16:12 What's funny is that the $1T in Tax Cuts were used by corps to buy back their own stocks (instead raising wages) & now those stocks are down 35%. In other words, the Tax cuts actually erased $350B from the market & that's not counting everyday Americans' retirement accts.
623 2018-12-24 21:15:58 That means there are some good deals out there. If you are worried about retirement funds find a money manager who works for a reasonable rate and gets your 401k more diversified. Stocks are always a risky retirement strategy.
624 2018-12-24 21:15:54 Many people loose profits doing this, no point 2 FOMO when the switch is flipped, accumulate and Hold is the crypto way sounds like you should selling stocks, why cash out to claim 5k when you can get double/triple the amount with patience
625 2018-12-24 21:15:43 Ik the stocks are crashing but when are we outlawing marijuana? 12 year old fortnite kids are overdosing on this deadly narcotic. Please do something.
626 2018-12-24 21:15:42 anybody with a brain! lol. It wasn't hard to see that the bull rise of the market for the past year was largely due to company buy-backs artificially prompting stocks. Everything else kinda going to shit except that? It was bound to happen
627 2018-12-24 21:15:38 Well that and the opportunity to trade stocks on inside information, which he did a ton of.
628 2018-12-24 21:15:37 The day he was inaugurated, I pulled all my money out of stocks, and moved it to money market funds.
629 2018-12-24 21:15:33 What is this panettone the grocery store stocks in bulk?
630 2018-12-24 21:15:33 This from CNN and her. Two laughing stocks.
631 2018-12-24 21:15:31 What they don't realise is that Trump will buy stocks while they are low and then settle things down and wait for the rebound to sell high. Not brain surgery just simple market manipulation?
632 2018-12-24 21:15:21 I guess they sold their stocks to buy crypto assets 
633 2018-12-24 21:15:16 Half of Americans own stocks, so you can't say "only the rich benefit" because the rich aren't half of America. Do the rich benefit the most? Obviously. That's an argument for raising capital gains, not abandoning the market as an investment vehicle for Americans.
634 2018-12-24 21:15:14 How many posts did you make when stocks went up “bigly” for the first 2 years of Trump’s presidency? But now suddenly it’s worth posting.

Typical NeverTrumper.
635 2018-12-24 21:15:13 The ultimate manipulating stocks to line your pockets.
636 2018-12-24 21:15:08 Stocks plunged downward, Trump is tweeting angrily about the Federal Reserve, and Steve Mnuchin stoked fear. Merry Christmas!
637 2018-12-24 21:14:33 Next year I’m buying all my loved ones stocks for Christmas
638 2018-12-24 21:14:25 Stocks plunged downward, Trump is tweeting angrily about the Federal Reserve, and Steve Mnuchin stoked fear. Merry Christmas!
639 2018-12-24 21:14:22 It’s very possible that the market will end this month as the worst December for stocks since 1931 under your watch.
640 2018-12-24 21:14:04 Wall Street selloff worsens on Mnuchin move, D.C. drama: A steep sell-off in U.S. stocks worsened… @environmentguru
641 2018-12-24 21:14:01 For the first two years of the Trump presidency the markets treated his dishonesty and craziness as background noise to all the soaring corporate profits and stocks. But that is no longer the case. Trump has markets worried — @tomfriedman #quote #RoguePresident #StockMarket
642 2018-12-24 21:13:53 I'm already seeing the new narrative playing out and being repeated like a parrot #stocks are in bear, #markets seeing blood, worst xmas eve selloff in history. BUT #bitcoin is holding. Bitcoin is at the end of a bear market  Bitcoin is a safe haven etc. My stop loss is in place.
643 2018-12-24 21:13:19 Most (stressing most) of the recent overvaluation was due to stock buybacks from the tax cut.  Everyone who knows anything understood the stocks were going to be over-inflated after the tax cut

645 2018-12-24 21:12:43 And I bet all their buddies and probably the Administration is shorting the hell out of stocks like the crooks they are. #TrumpCrimeFamily #trumpcrimes
646 2018-12-24 21:12:34 Right.

Because they’re safe.

It’s why you rebalance your 401k to hold fewer stocks and more bonds as you get older.

Has no one explained this to you?
647 2018-12-24 21:12:30 stocks are something the rich worry about. The rest of us just get the trickle down BS.
648 2018-12-24 21:12:16 $SQ this market is reckless ! Cheap stocks all over the place !
649 2018-12-24 21:12:13 What was he babbling about? Ps, I'm so glad I don't own stocks.
650 2018-12-24 21:11:40 Let’s get this straight, Trump created a $22 Trillion national debt, started multiple trade wars, shuts down the gov’t, then blames the #Fed for slumping stocks? How #HerbertHoover of him. #maga=kkk
651 2018-12-24 21:11:32 Today you made the stocks fall even more than they were falling before you started calling those banks. Way to go! You've managed to make the stocks fall more than your cult leader! (Hope the falling stocks screw you & all your swamp 1%er friends)
652 2018-12-24 21:11:25 Rich people (80% of stocks) are no longer making money on stocks. This is unacceptable. Get on it, Munchkin.

654 2018-12-24 21:11:19 I don't think you get my point man. Because my parents depend less on their 401k, what has happened with stocks really doesn't hurt their retirement prospects. However, a recession most certainly would. Yes, the stocks may be a signal for that, but in the short run, little inpact
655 2018-12-24 21:11:15 The unpredictabiliry of the stocks may make some on edge, but the stability in Jesus the Rock gives me such peace. Merry Christmas!!
656 2018-12-24 21:11:10 Donald:
Since you are immune to conflicts of interest, I suggest shorting the stock market.
Your first HHS secretary, Price, was buying stocks while working on bills that related to them.
This isnt much of a stretch.
657 2018-12-24 21:11:08 Then I’m guessing you don’t own any stocks.
658 2018-12-24 21:10:59 what i mean is, for now, buying stocks is better if you're unsure of risk appetite. good buying opportunity imo.
659 2018-12-24 21:10:48 Everybody is getting stocks for Christmas! Yay!!
660 2018-12-24 21:10:46 my family: how do you feel about stocks

me: definitely preferred over timed. no items, though
661 2018-12-24 21:10:42 Agreed.  Dow - all 30 down.  SPY 490/500 down.  QQQ - 97/100 down.  Almost 2,350 stocks making 52-week lows.  This is broad based selling that we have ever witnessed.  In my statistics life, I have never seen anything like this.
662 2018-12-24 21:10:29 The strategies that I will be teaching will work on all asset classes. I will be demonstrating them on futures, forex and stocks/ETF's. Of course in option trading, you start your analysis on the underlying securities.
663 2018-12-24 21:10:26 Stocks are on sale.
664 2018-12-24 21:10:07 If you’re doing what you should be doing, you’re starting out in stocks and then slowly rebalancing towards bonds as you approach retirement. Saving for retirement is a marathon, not a sprint, and long term stock returns beat bonds
665 2018-12-24 21:09:58 Bank and insurance stocks are down . Soon they will raise fees and premiums so they and their shareholders make more money . They have the power of taxation without being accountable #yellowvestalberta . Governments allow all this . Governments are the enemy of the people.
666 2018-12-24 21:09:57 We survived a time with 17% mortgage rates. Low rates now are not normal. People need to be able to handle a 5% rate so it’s worth having savings and cds, not losing everything in stocks and bonds.
667 2018-12-24 21:09:45 My friend who actually worked for a financial firm/stocks is absolutely right when he says a lot of folks on social media know absolutely nothing about the stock market!
668 2018-12-24 21:09:40 When I analyzed why I miss good entries ? I found that the reason behind it is that the stocks sometime give all movement before 9.30, and sometime it breaks after 2.30.. In between traders are hunting for a chicken when the real cock ran away.
669 2018-12-24 21:09:35 And on the stock market rout . A saving Grace that #DowJones did not  close down 666 points on Christmas Eve ! No pun intended.
#stocks #BearMarket
670 2018-12-24 21:09:22 @realDonaldTrump I want to put this in perspective u might understand..stocks tank..worst ever. So things haven't been this bad since ur grandfather was running brothels. Do u still have a hand in that family business?
671 2018-12-24 21:09:08 @maddow Is there any way to check if Mnuchin, Trump and other members of the Trump administration are shorting stocks? That's the only sane explanation to what their actions.
672 2018-12-24 21:09:04 as of now 401k...but if bear market holds I will start adding individual stocks (I have zero expertise in individual stocks as of now :)
673 2018-12-24 21:08:52 Democratic supporters are dumping stocks like it’s the fuckin Boston tea party.... does making the president look bad economically worth the health of the people on Xmas eve?? Cmon now stop the bullshit for Jesus birthday, let the people breath
674 2018-12-24 21:08:41 ownership of property in the form of physical property or stocks is a class-modifer hill I will die on
675 2018-12-24 21:08:26 Wish I hadn’t bought everyone stocks for Christmas
676 2018-12-24 21:08:11 The Dow Jones is not the economy. It’s an average of 30 stocks.
677 2018-12-24 21:08:06 You just killed the stocks even more than you have done all december. Keep up the good work.  clown
678 2018-12-24 21:07:57 real estate - only real asset
Gold silver - physical + ETF + Miners stocks (some of them already gone bankrupt :)
679 2018-12-24 21:07:46 If plummeting stocks, doing Russia’s bidding, military officials resigning, and wasting money on a wall are “Making America Great Again” then I’m ready to go back to when it was terrible.
680 2018-12-24 21:07:35 He’s too busy buying up all the stocks that dropped.
681 2018-12-24 21:07:17 The next crisis is an inflationary/monetary system crisis. That's deeper than a liquidity crisis which we saw in 2008, ultimately fixable. Stocks finding their real value is not a "crisis"
682 2018-12-24 21:06:59 @BarackObama could have taken a torch to the #2ndAmendment if he wanted to, he got away with everything else. #Obamacare #IranDeal. @BarackObama approved the sales of Bump Stocks where as @realDonaldTrump made it illegal.  Go sling your BS elsewhere.
683 2018-12-24 21:06:55 Instead of actual growth, Trump and the GOP engaged in a scam to make stocks seem more valuable than they are. The reason it’s called a bubble is that it will burst.
684 2018-12-24 21:06:01 A “bear market” is when stocks see a 20 percent decline or more from  a recent high. Bear markets have lasted 13 months on average, and stock markets tend to lose 30.4 percent of their value. It usually takes stocks an average 22 months to recover. #TrumpShutdown #ThanksTrump
685 2018-12-24 21:05:17 Yep going to buy a new car with all that money I gained from selling stocks the last few weeks. Winning indeed!
686 2018-12-24 21:05:02 "Markets fell 650 points at closing as Trump pinned blame on the Fed
The decline marked one of the worst Christmas Eves ever for U.S. stocks. Trump tried to assign sole blame for the sell-off to the Federal Reserve, likening the central bank to a golfer who 'can’t putt'"
687 2018-12-24 21:04:45 dr. Brandt says the same...  80% decline in stocks ahead.  Not that I care,  I'm all in crypto
688 2018-12-24 21:04:34 BY THE WAY YOU LYING CRIMINAL trump; stock market UNDER OBAMA WENT UP!  YOU JUST CREATED THE UNCERTAINTY THAT DESTROYED STOCKS IN WORST WEEK SINCE GREAT DEPRESSION.  WE WILL #IMPEACH YOU FOR CRIMES NO MATTER WHAT OBSTRUCTION YOU KEEP COMMITTING.  #INDICT #CONVICT #IMPRISON trump!
689 2018-12-24 21:04:09 What goes around comes around man. We young, we will see multiple bear markets in our life, stocks are getting cheaper now for us to load up on for the next bull market. Cycles!
690 2018-12-24 21:03:32 Perhaps the whitest thing ever said in my house is my mother complaining about her stocks going down
691 2018-12-24 21:03:29 So, all the TV hosts/people who voted for & believed in 45 must be extremely happy as big business owners bought back their stocks too. Now they're failing to explain to the public how African Americans were fooled too although Blacks were too smart to vote for a flunky. Amazing!
692 2018-12-24 21:03:18 You cannot predict but you can prepare. #markets #stocks
693 2018-12-24 21:03:15 It's been wild recently listening to my coworkers in their 50s complaining about losing out on the stock market and just being like "I can't afford to buy stocks so this literally doesn't matter to me."
694 2018-12-24 21:03:13 Stocks are in red and oil is shit. #ChristmasMassacre is when you must quit
695 2018-12-24 21:03:05 wrong.  the problem is caused by false economics, voodoo economics that throw a party that can't be paid for.  had you taken Economics in grad school and fathomed it, you would know that your relief for the wealthy, along with speculative overpricing of stocks, tanked the economy
696 2018-12-24 21:02:53 HAMMER: SIRI, December Stocks are the worst reported since the Great Depression in 1931. What does this mean? 

SIRI: We breaking records? The likes of which we’ve never seen?
697 2018-12-24 21:02:47 Should of sold your stocks at their high prices like everyone else.
698 2018-12-24 21:02:39 One way to look at this for the 401k investor is that for a few years you will be dollar cost averaging accumulation of stocks at low prices

701 2018-12-24 21:02:28 This is bad. Stocks plunging, never seen it go down this bad on Christmas Eve. Probably because of government shutdown. You think? #abc7ny

Retweet for crypto.

Favorite for stocks.
703 2018-12-24 21:02:03 it very possible that the market will end this month as the worst December for stocks since 1931. Thank you Mr Trump. You did something Obama didn’t do – crashed the market
704 2018-12-24 21:01:53 I lost what I consider a good chunk. I'm by no means rich. Just a union painter that works for TVA. One of my stocks I had 400 dollars worth of was only worth 46.28 when I sold it. My other ones have lost a little over half. I was just trying to get ahead.
705 2018-12-24 21:01:16 @kevin_inthehous  I am SOOOOO glad that you pocketed that $75k.  But remember, when the market crashes it makes stocks cheap. So buy more...that way when the Dems take over you’ll make some money and dollar cost average.  Merry Christmas my twitter friend.
706 2018-12-24 21:01:01 Depends, I rolled my 401k over to a brokerage IRA (tax at retirement pull out) at a 10% loss from October peaks. Will keep it in a 1% interest cash account until SPX tests 2100 or 1600 to begin scaling into my favorite tech stocks.
707 2018-12-24 21:00:58 The Stock Exchange, Traders and Investors should’ve started pushing back many months ago when #45 tweets about specific companies had a neg or pos effect on their shares. Like everything else, people turned a blind eye and now similar tweets are affecting stocks everywhere.
708 2018-12-24 21:00:48 NYT: stocks were on track for their worst year since 2008

Correction: stocks are on track for the worst year since 2008, the last time a Republican was in office.
709 2018-12-24 21:00:26 As a liberal with a degree in Marine Biology I am all for reducing a population of sea lions that is not endangered to protect vital fish stocks.  By reducing fish stock habits we have created easy access for sea lions to consume them. People on both sides need to do research.
710 2018-12-24 21:00:02 Anyone can acquire the know-how for analyzing stocks.
711 2018-12-24 20:59:51 Bump stocks lead to bolts, firing pins, etc etc,,,,smh
712 2018-12-24 20:59:51 My guess - there are a significant number of baby boomers who are either nearing/retired who own a massively disproportionate amount of stocks for their age/risk tolerance. Millionaires on paper who are hoping that this time is different. (It isn’t) $spx
713 2018-12-24 20:59:40 I don't think he can to start off with but the mere mention of firing the current chair of the Fed sent stocks tumbling.

716 2018-12-24 20:59:20 Who have we abandoned? Who have we appeased? Stocks are crashing because of the FED and the midterms, factors out of Trumps control (while all other economic metrics are excellent, by the way). Wall is being built one way or another. Obamacare on the way out, thanks to a judge...
717 2018-12-24 20:59:15 Democratic congressmen seemed to have some inside information as to what the fed was going to do with interest rates. A democratic congressional aid said she was warned to move her money out of stocks before the rate hikes and market drop. Interesting ha.
718 2018-12-24 20:58:53 Poll: Did you nibble on stocks today?
719 2018-12-24 20:58:28 For gold/silver/real estate, you’re talking physical assets yes?  Not like stocks, reits, etc.
720 2018-12-24 20:58:28 i was under the impression that stocks can’t go down ?
721 2018-12-24 20:58:17 Damn it CNN it wasn't the Trump administration, that's made stocks plummet, it was Trump. Tell it like it is.
722 2018-12-24 20:58:06 How r ur favorite stocks ? Apple nvidia ?
723 2018-12-24 20:57:58 The last time stocks had a worse year than this one was 2008.

724 2018-12-24 20:57:57 Bear market, Stocks - 20%

We are in crisis, 2019, cyclical.
725 2018-12-24 20:57:38 stocks are cheap

true, yet meaningless
726 2018-12-24 20:57:36 I have some monies sitting in old 401Ks, too scared to even look at it. Last I logged in was to move the funds from low growth and stable government bonds to aggressive growth stocks
727 2018-12-24 20:57:33 Stocks markets plummeting.
Government shutdown.
National debt soaring.
Firearm deaths rising.
Cabinet members fleeing in protest.
Russia laughing at US.
Perjury, obstruction, indictments, jail sentences for @realDonaldTrump associates.

729 2018-12-24 20:57:25 December is usually a healthy month for stocks, but this month has been the worst since 1931. Merry Christmas Mr. Grinch #TrumpResign #TrumpShutdown #TrumpChristmasShutdown
730 2018-12-24 20:57:18 From the Washington Post:

 December is usually a healthy month for stocks, but this month has been  the worst since 1931.

Thanks a lot, punk,
731 2018-12-24 20:57:14 The worst felling is when you wake up  to your #stocks in a declining #graphical manner . And lossing more that 5grand. #StockMarket #watch
732 2018-12-24 20:57:08 And I don’t short. I began with stocks during the 90s bull market, it’s what I learned and what to feel comfortable with. Sorry I don’t spread myself thin with trying to know it all. But what I do know, I feel confident in it.
733 2018-12-24 20:56:55 I do and thanks to this nosedive, if I live my average expected life span I will be broke in a few years. Meanwhile, rich people can, & probably insiders like Mnuchin, sold off high, and can afford to buy up stocks at rock bottom prices. This will eventually effect us all.
734 2018-12-24 20:56:48 You can't cut tax, allow debt to climb 1.5 trillion, get into a trade war with China and others, and ask for an expensive wall and expect stocks to continue upward. This is not about the Fed. Rex Tillerson was right.  Trump is a f***ing moron.
735 2018-12-24 20:56:44 Boy them stocks took a hit today!!! Damn near every notification I got today was saying a stick was down a certain percentage today and some hit 52 week Lows
736 2018-12-24 20:56:20 David Tepper played the American public selling stocks to them on this pump and dump scam and @CNBC is the sucker sending the message. U guys are suck clowns at this point, no more staying silent
737 2018-12-24 20:56:14 just heard about the stocks. so sorry - please let me know if there’s any way i can help 
738 2018-12-24 20:56:09 We need a CNBC special on “Stocks Hammered by Memes”
739 2018-12-24 20:56:06 Three investment tips for your early 20’s:

- Avoid savings accounts unless the interest rates can at least keep up with inflation
- Use trading apps like Robinhood to ease into stocks
- If you aren’t considering crypto, you’re going to wish you did

Start young and take risks.
740 2018-12-24 20:55:56 Crisis cycle 2019-8, 2007-8, 1996-7, 1985-6, 1974, 1963, 1952-3, 1941-2, 1930-1, 1921

Crisis create strong changes in prices like oil, stocks, houses.

Crises may create long periods of conflicts in politics, economy, they may combine themselves with crashes, recession cycles.
741 2018-12-24 20:55:41 Yeah, I was suggesting guaranteed RoR on private plans as a temporary step towards a true public plan. Something needs to be done sooner rather than later to detach retirement from the whims of stocks
742 2018-12-24 20:55:15 So I go, If you head a giant bank, and the Treasury Secretary checks in with you from Mexico, and you short stocks, is that insider trading?
743 2018-12-24 20:55:04 80% of stocks are owned by the rich. Sucks for them.
744 2018-12-24 20:54:52 Declines led by the FAANG stocks... Chinese sovereign wealth pullout?
745 2018-12-24 20:54:52 The upside of not having stocks is this would be a great time to get in. For me it's an opportunity to further increase my skills by putting off retirement at least another year.
746 2018-12-24 20:54:41 A few stocks looking like steals
747 2018-12-24 20:54:36 Come April-May monster rally...reduced rigs, greater than expected gasoline draws, and OPEC panicking should see oil stocks rebound violently to upside
748 2018-12-24 20:54:35 Dow stocks are way down, taking millions from people's retirement.

Tell me again how the stock market and economy are doing great because of a spoiled rich psycho who went bankrupt six times?

#StockMarket #TrumpResign 

Why is the #StockMarket not trending?

Distractions work.
749 2018-12-24 20:54:29 He is just flexing his muscle.  He wants to save the day.  He has claimed without him the stock market would crash and now trying to prove it.  As soon as the stocks take a turn in the green, he'll declare it a win.  He's gambling with our livelihood on most fronts.
750 2018-12-24 20:54:21 The answer is - what can you do to fix the market?  To give a simple stat - The forward earnings on an average for SPY stocks is around 15 now; ridiculously cheap.  If you can't find a buyer at this price, then we are looking at some serious issues going forward.  Please act.
751 2018-12-24 20:53:49 Stocks aren’t the only thing that affect the distribution of wealth,  Taxes, wages,each of these can and do contribute to wealth distribution. But since 1991 it's been the stock market that's the most potent driver of inequality. according  to EPI and UK  School of Economics
752 2018-12-24 20:53:34 RIP my stocks. Should've followed the rulings that holding any stock is haram.
753 2018-12-24 20:53:31 Trump the greatest what this day?? He continues to feed an massive ego plus manage to lay blame on EVERY person that refuses to prop up Trump's multiple lies. When the stocks were doing well he claimed that he did this by himself now he's blaming every person that he hired!!
754 2018-12-24 20:53:08 As stocks enter a bear market #Bitcoin and #Cryptocurrencies are an increasingly attractive hedge against future volatility. Amidst rising interest rates and an unpredictable trade war that is affecting financial markets worldwide, Bitcoin continues it's #Antifragile journey.
755 2018-12-24 20:52:58 What if.....
Wall St. planned this last year; sell stocks high and buy crypto low.... what will be their next plan? 
756 2018-12-24 20:52:57 #BREAKING: U.S. stocks plunged on Monday in their worst day of Christmas Eve trading ever.
757 2018-12-24 20:52:28 #Nasdaq #Stock #Crypto #Xrp xrp can skyrocket, and ripple suddenly can be one of the most rich companys in the world, and world payment soon take seconds!not days to complete and cost tiny little compare what it cost today. Stocks down Crypto with real utility up. xrp 32$-100$eoy
758 2018-12-24 20:52:26 Fresh off torching military, this “admin” torches stocks.
759 2018-12-24 20:52:16 He creates the best time to buy on purpose. Poor people can't buy while stocks are up or down regardless, while the wealthy elite get to buy up more and more on the cheap until a Dem takes over and fixes it all.
760 2018-12-24 20:52:09 I am retired with a tiny investment in the market. The Fed and Democrats are behind the plunging stocks and I will NEVER blame Trump. This is on the Scumocrats. #Trump2020 #BuildThatWallNOW #SchumerShutdown
761 2018-12-24 20:52:09 Do they have stocks / 401K?  Just ask how it’s going...
762 2018-12-24 20:52:02 Exactly. Look how he handled those 2. Puerto Rico 2 yrs later. Ruined. In Crisis. What is it 39,000 people dead from gun violence this year. Since then there are more guns in more places. And last week, he banned bump stocks, wow. Toddlers kill majority of people in the home.
763 2018-12-24 20:51:52 I’d invest 25k directly into music, 25k would go in the bank, and 50k would be funneled into various investments to flip that money into even more. (Real estate, stocks, eBay, etc)
764 2018-12-24 20:51:51 Just reported that Trump’s tweet today blaming the Fed for the markets crashing actually ACCELERATED the crash, stocks dropped even further because of what Trump tweeted.
765 2018-12-24 20:51:50 I warned my friends to get rid of their stocks, today they lost Big 
766 2018-12-24 20:51:19 The bank won't be happy this week when I tell them I want to cash out my stocks and instead place my money under my mattress.  At this point, it's safer and yields better dividends.
767 2018-12-24 20:50:37 Anything that potentially improve my passive income basically, from investing in company stocks to potential businesses that can run without my physical self. So I can continue to make music while not necessarily rely on it financially.
768 2018-12-24 20:50:15 at least i have a reason to root for stocks to go down now
769 2018-12-24 20:50:15 indeed people gna be laughing at stocks this upcoming year
770 2018-12-24 20:49:40 Stocks plunged Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 653 points following President Trump's tweet attacking the Federal Reserve and its independence. YOU ARE A LOSER @realDonaldTrump #TrumpResign
771 2018-12-24 20:49:31 The trick is to find the right minning stocks to buy. Some will do very well but others may not. Sprott Asset management might be a good company to consult with on that. They are a reputable company IMHO.
772 2018-12-24 20:49:27 Been sitting mostly in cash for months, bought physical gold during that time, while also shorting gold mining stocks. Just waiting for the dollar to resume its rally so I can buy more gold and close my short.
773 2018-12-24 20:49:21 Bump stock are the thing noone should have but you said yourself bump stocks hurts more than helps the shooter.
774 2018-12-24 20:49:02 ending wars is bad for stocks!!!
775 2018-12-24 20:48:59 I think they did this I purpose so all his rich cronies with money  can take advantage and buy up stocks and the bargain prices. Do these people really think Americans don’t know what’s going on here!
776 2018-12-24 20:48:57 80% of stocks are owned by the rich. Sucks for them.
777 2018-12-24 20:48:07 Regular people whose companies put their retirement funds in stocks are also losing a shitload of money. 

(Like me)

Merry Christmas, I guess?
778 2018-12-24 20:48:06 So sad your investments mean more to you than our country. 
Didn't hear you crying when you were making money the last 2 years of record stocks??
Exactly how Democrats think! Me me me and Trump Bad... Waaaaaaa!
779 2018-12-24 20:47:19 Before leaving for Cabo, Mnuchin must have told the Plunge Protection Team to sell stocks.
780 2018-12-24 20:47:00 Stock market corrections r great time to buy
On the other hand, these hiccups usually turn into outstanding buying opportunities buying an index fund, or high-quality stocks in a major index S&P 500, In a correction is close to a surefire long-term return as you're going to get.
781 2018-12-24 20:46:48 “December is usually a healthy month for stocks, but this month has been the worst since 1931.” Notice when stocks go up Trump claims credit, wonder who is to blame for this? #POTUS #StockMarket #NotMyPresident
782 2018-12-24 20:46:41 Don’t we need to see stocks move down in large whole numbers before it’s done?
783 2018-12-24 20:46:39 Hey!
Don't like crashing stocks?
"Call Wall Street".
Bully investors into buying shit.
Beg big banks to bail you out.
Offer US Treasury to give banks "liquidity".

@stevenmnuchin1
784 2018-12-24 20:46:28 What a desperate, panic driven move to make. Good going, Steve. Looks like stocks tanked another 600 today. So glad you reassured everyone that things are peachy with the banks. 
785 2018-12-24 20:46:13 Apparently, before leaving for vacation in Mexico, Mnuchin told the Plunge Protection Team to sell stocks.
786 2018-12-24 20:45:58 On a side note usually a good time to buy stocks if you have any cash saved up
787 2018-12-24 20:45:42  That graph was Dec 24 2017 to Dec 24 2018. It was from my iPhone stocks app. No trickery. Is there something wrong with a 1 year graph?
788 2018-12-24 20:45:39 Agreed. My stocks are already depleted. Each one was so nice, a few others left to try now.
789 2018-12-24 20:45:38 you know, if this is the start of a heavy bear market on the stocks, and crypto has already had its correction, this could really work out well for crypto with all this money leaving stocks. will just a take a few months of growth and btc could look very appealing to the ave eye
790 2018-12-24 20:45:34 So if stocks go up, it’s because of YOU. If stocks go down, it’s because of the Fed. Got it!
791 2018-12-24 20:44:58 Did you not see Schumer tweeting stocks
792 2018-12-24 20:44:51 STOP celebrating a down market. Millions of Americans have large paper losses. And, unless one is short stocks, a bear market, especially if it portends a recession, is bad for the country. This is gloating, Trumpian behavior.
793 2018-12-24 20:44:41 I dont disagree,  the market made huge jumps and eventually had to correct. I think that European instability has helped downturn the market as well. Along with fed rate hikes and projections. We are still 2000 points above the starting point. Stocks dont always determine economy
794 2018-12-24 20:44:13 Dude, it's christmas. Give a break to money, assets, stocks, crypto...let's stop and relax
795 2018-12-24 20:44:00 Hey @realDonaldTrump & @stevenmnuchin1 you must be so proud. Stocks were down the most for any Christmas Eve in History. Break your arm patting yourself on your back. You are to blame for this, absolutely. So proud. Steve, enjoy your vacation! Donald, hope the lights stay on @ WH
796 2018-12-24 20:43:44 the stock markets seem very crashy lately

oh boy i can't wait to buy a lot of stocks on 4 january 2019
797 2018-12-24 20:43:29 Index or individual stocks?
798 2018-12-24 20:43:11 Look, the point is nobody should have them. The only thing bump stocks do is hurt the 2A cause.
799 2018-12-24 20:43:05 A market dip for someone like me is usually a good thing as it’s an opportunity to buy cheap and sell after a bounce. I only keep $$$ around because bitcoin, bonds, stocks... it’s all gambling. As with all gambling there’s always a winner and a loser... better see whose buying..
800 2018-12-24 20:43:01 Lupe won't save stocks but he'll surely save crypto!
801 2018-12-24 20:42:59 Stocks currently dropping faster than Xmas stockings.
802 2018-12-24 20:42:53 Things that could go wrong:

Expensive stocks could actually grow at levels that are currently priced in
Things could get worse outside the U.S. even faster than the rate that's priced in
Currencies could move unfavorably
803 2018-12-24 20:42:11 thx @stockboardasset Who is long an economy ETF? Stocks lead the economy. As always. Beat economists repeatedly. #BakesTakes_
804 2018-12-24 20:41:52 They just need to shut the stock market down for the rest of the year!!!!  My stocks are just falling!!!! #StockMarket #damn #smh
805 2018-12-24 20:41:51 >Stocks on pace for the worst December since the Great Depression.

>Day 3 of the #TrumpShutdown 

>400,000 govt employees not getting paid this Xmas

Ahhh...#MAGA courtesy of @GOP, @realDonaldTrump and his moronic MAGAts!
806 2018-12-24 20:41:48 2 years of a roaring economy and 30+ records broken and now one down month gives the propaganda news channels and their rat journalists the green light to start rolling the bullshit “PLUNGING STOCKS” and THE WORLD IS ENDING stories 

It’s complete nonsense/hysteria*
807 2018-12-24 20:41:44 Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called top US bankers on Sunday amid the pullback in stocks & to call a meeting of financial regulators to discuss ways to ensure “normal market operations.” Sounds like you'll be accepting the resignation of another cabinet member real soon.
808 2018-12-24 20:41:44 Stocks are low now so the top 3% can by cheap then later sell high !!!
809 2018-12-24 20:41:34 The only thing he could hang his hat on was the coming economy he inherited from Obama but he managed to mess that up. Stocks in toilet, US awash in red ink, recession around the corner. #recession #ResignTrump
810 2018-12-24 20:41:21 Not really a rebuttal. Simply pointing that out the vast majority of stocks are owned by a relatively small segment of society.
811 2018-12-24 20:41:16 HaHaHaHaHaHa!!!!! Not your stocks now!
812 2018-12-24 20:40:56 I know, I just closed my stocks after. A big lose! Thanks a lot!! Fucker!!
813 2018-12-24 20:40:54 Hate to tell you but, trump's tweets are not that importent. It's a systemic problem that happens about every 7 years and we are overdue. Stocks were inflated by guy backs from tax cuts and cheap loans. Now the payback.
814 2018-12-24 20:40:53 With Trump tweeting that the Fed is “the only problem” with the US economy, US stocks have plunged in their worst Christmas Eve trading day ever, as the S&P 500 officially enters a bear market.
815 2018-12-24 20:40:43 US stocks fall record on Christmas Eve

Everything that starts wrong ends wrong

will the government of Trump start right?
816 2018-12-24 20:40:41 Stock markets are plunging and American corporations used all their tax benefits to buy back stocks this year instead of invest in American workers. #TrumpCrash
817 2018-12-24 20:40:18 that's the thing, only one of my parents has a 401k and bc my parents have bounced back and forth in the gig economy (they're musicians) its been largely worthless even though its tied to stocks.
818 2018-12-24 20:40:09 Not financial advise but yes, probably a very good play as you get even more leverage buying minning stocks. But hold the physical stock certificate because stocks like gold are also rehypothecated.
819 2018-12-24 20:40:06 Bitcoin has no instrinsic value. The markets always go up, always go down. But the market has always averaged 10-11% long term. Stocks are backed by assets that will rarely be worth zero. Hence Intrinsic Value. BTC is always going to be just like regular fiat.
820 2018-12-24 20:39:51 Yeah companies you believe in is a good way to start. If you are already investing than you should have a basic understanding. In the term long term, smart investing will make you money. Stocks can go down but it always go up in the long term.
821 2018-12-24 20:39:23 Al Qaeda, ISIS 2.0, Administration in shambles, stocks in toilet.  MAGA
822 2018-12-24 20:39:10 Stocks are likely to enter a long bear market (most likely already in one).
I am sure many traders of legacy markets wish they had that bitcoin ETF approved and ready to go right now. 
823 2018-12-24 20:39:06 The stocks surged at the passage of the tax cuts, therefore since taxes hasn’t risen possibly its something else. Like thousands in a caravan trying to illegally enter the US and congress refusing to fund security? Perhaps you should learn to knit a sweater.
824 2018-12-24 20:39:04 I should have moved my stocks   too late now...
Had the feeling, but acting on feelings is like voting for a Republicans.  I just cannot learn from the past.
825 2018-12-24 20:38:46 Id invest in my moms buisness degree and her patent pending invention. Stocks for later bigger payback (if all goes well as we both know stocks can be iffy)
826 2018-12-24 20:38:35 my friends are getting married and they’re starting their careers they’ll have kids and stocks by this time next year  
827 2018-12-24 20:38:32 Actually, a much more meaningful comparison would be to buy (a) a condo (b) some stocks (c) some bonds (d) some farmland (e) some bitcoin (f) some gold - and see what you have in 10-20 years.

Personally, I 'd get silver and farmland.
828 2018-12-24 20:38:30 U.S. Stocks, Obama vs. @realDonaldTrump 
Obama (Inaugural 2009 to Dec. 24, 2010): +47.7%
Trump (Inaugural 2017 to Dec. 24, 2018):  +3.9%
(S&P 500 data, not including dividends)
829 2018-12-24 20:38:13 Do yourself a favor and don’t invest in stocks right now, that is all.
830 2018-12-24 20:37:51 I'm buying 75,000 worth of stocks
831 2018-12-24 20:37:47 Well, that’s a pretty broad sweeping statement. So, in reverse, if there weren’t “investment managers” would stocks then be less volatile? We used to have that world and stocks were actually more volatile then. 1/2
832 2018-12-24 20:37:28 stocks or bonds with the rest...
833 2018-12-24 20:37:17 Their stocks is literally shit. Time to get the Defensive shill forces
834 2018-12-24 20:37:17 As long as my stocks eventually go higher, I'm good with it!
835 2018-12-24 20:37:15 Us stocks as of now.
836 2018-12-24 20:37:08 Are you nuts? Stocks on sale? At these levels?
837 2018-12-24 20:37:07 $WDBG #WEALTH
838 2018-12-24 20:36:58 Let’s see; republican administration....stocks crash...par for the course since 1900.
839 2018-12-24 20:36:51 Full start on my music career and the rest into investing/stocks
840 2018-12-24 20:36:37 When stocks stopped being a measure of business health & absorbed $4 trillion minted Fed Reserve cash it held inflation at bay.

With rates rising & Dems about to embrace chaos in the House, it's logical for billions to sell off & move elsewhere.

If it's spent, INFLATION.

#tcot
841 2018-12-24 20:36:21 In stocks.
842 2018-12-24 20:35:51 Hey Donald...Time to #ResignTrump just like you said the president should do if stocks plummeted.  Or, are you, @realDonaldTrump a liar in chief?  #TrumpShutdown #TrumpResign
843 2018-12-24 20:34:50 "It’s very possible that the market will end this month as the worst December for stocks since 1931." - ALEX VEIGA from AP  Thanks @realDonaldTrump for continuing to drive the country and it's economy in the shitter! #ChristmasEve2018
844 2018-12-24 20:34:48 Thoughts on stocks right now:

We’re hitting some major supports on big names in tech and index funds are getting slammed. Expecting some short term relief in the next couple days. Overall still bearish as confidence in the market won’t return for some time.
845 2018-12-24 20:34:26 2 small of a sample 2 say that 4 now,it looks ATM indeed but then again did stocks went down 52% in a month?a relief rally is excpected
846 2018-12-24 20:34:22 Okay... I have to say, if it comes to pass that this was all a ploy by Trump and his cronies to make money off short selling of stocks, not only should he be impeached and removed, torture will be too lenient of a punishment for him.
847 2018-12-24 20:34:14 @sengraham2016   As long as you let Trump continue you will have no stocks, etc left.
848 2018-12-24 20:33:59 He’s shorting stocks.  So this is good for his economy. Smh
849 2018-12-24 20:33:48 lool why do u say that? you invested in any stocks?
850 2018-12-24 20:33:44 I should have liquidated, but I also dont hold a lot of high P/E stocks. Rock bottom for Dow is about 18k. If it breaks there we're (technical term inc) royally fucked.
851 2018-12-24 20:33:37 Are you adding us stocks or foreign stocks ?
852 2018-12-24 20:33:36 Your so called 'MANAGEMENT TEAM' does not invest in certain stocks, NO

#EndtheFed
853 2018-12-24 20:33:31 There are stocks that cost a penny. You can work at McDonald's and your retirement plan could be affected by this. Institutions and fund managers make money selling and shorting, even on downward motion. Retail investors hold and hope for the best. They're the most affected.
854 2018-12-24 20:33:28 VIX keeps moving higher - this means a short term bottom is coming into play - we think 1st week of Jan as there is tax loss selling underway and margin calls are driving forced selling of over priced stocks.. VIX at 35-40 range = buy..
855 2018-12-24 20:32:55 Oil stocks at bargain prices following eight week freefall. With Crude trading at $42.68/barrel today, note these: Apache “APA” $25.40/share; Devon Energy “DVN” $20.98/share; Chaparral Energy “CHAP” $4.97/share.
856 2018-12-24 20:32:40 People will remember when the orange menace departs. Our stocks are plunging. Lol.
857 2018-12-24 20:32:38 Limited edition while stocks last
858 2018-12-24 20:32:37 The major indexes on Wall Street fell another 2 percent Monday, making it very possible that the market will end this month as the worst December for stocks since 1931.#ChristmasEve
859 2018-12-24 20:32:01 Welcome to Trump University/Master Class aka America Today. This is the part where all the Trump believers stay suckered in until they lose all their money. Stocks crash. Recession hits. Then Trumpsters say, “But Obama”.  #FalseProphet #LyingDonny #TinyHands

863 2018-12-24 20:31:41 Hello #MAGANERS the #StockMarket numbers are #TrumpsFault but hey I bet not many of you own Stocks anyway. carry on.
864 2018-12-24 20:31:24 @Un. The Halliburton heist is today. World Banks Fed reserves and all financial intitutions. Personal and business account. Secure all. Stocks bonds and all assets. Donot buy bitcoin
865 2018-12-24 20:31:12 RT paulkrugman: Remember, when stocks go up, it's proof of Trump's genius, but when they go down, it's someone else's fault. Probably a conspiracy by the deep state's allies, the deep private sector.
866 2018-12-24 20:31:01 My Tech stock friends, get ready to buy -- we've got some very nice discounts right now and they'll probably get better!

Example: $MSFT has a target price of around $125 but is selling at around $94. This company is expected to overtake $AAPL!!! #stockstowatch #investing #stocks
867 2018-12-24 20:30:29 Wonder if any large institutional blocks of stocks being liquidated or most small orders.
868 2018-12-24 20:30:24 In fact, in early 2007 you said an economic re-acceleration was more likely than a recession and LT outlook of stocks “very bullish”.
869 2018-12-24 20:29:54 U. S. stocks on track for their worst year since 2008 & the largest December decline since the 1930s. The man who enjoys taking credit is pointing fingers at anyone but himself. We all heard him own the #shutdown but now blames Dems. This #potus is a disgrace to this nation.
870 2018-12-24 20:29:51 The way you do that is to sit tight. Almost always what drops the most in a period like this bounces back the most when the right side of the V takes hold. Of course, I don’t know what you own but if it is just high volatility stocks, then what I said basically holds.
871 2018-12-24 20:29:03 Haha, poor powerless baby trump still has not come to terms with the reality that king don is being led to the stocks. #emperorhasnoclothes
872 2018-12-24 20:28:55 Stock earnings and revenue are good.....Interest rates pushed prices down (temporarily). I am taking a contrarian position and looking at energy stocks. Buy on weakness they say!
873 2018-12-24 20:28:51 If they're trying to recover just run out and Nair them. Instant stock. Don't immediately try to punish Ftilt if it's spaced well, that move is really good. Keep an eye out specifically for holy water, that's how they deal big damage and  close stocks.
874 2018-12-24 20:28:44 Is it possible that he and his friends are shorting stocks right now? #Saudis #MBS #Putin #Russians #Oligarchs
875 2018-12-24 20:28:11 I’m no genius. Just “went pro” in 2017 and either didn’t understand some things then or didn’t see value. Cash drag hurt in 2017. Raised some cash in October because some stocks were too rich. I claim no market timing skill. Net net I should have been long.
876 2018-12-24 20:28:07 Good thing my broke ass doesn’t have any money invested in stocks!!!
877 2018-12-24 20:27:49 I think guillotine and gulag stocks are going to be soaring
878 2018-12-24 20:27:46 I'm not sure which is a worse idea. Trump not understanding how hes hurting people or him hurting people on purpose to drive the market down so that him and his family and friends could potentially buy a bunch of stocks at a low price for when it goes up.
879 2018-12-24 20:27:45 Thanks Stocks, likewise to you and yours x
880 2018-12-24 20:27:43 Selling stock might make a company short-term profits. But in the long-term, you'll lose money. That's why I will never sell stocks in AOG CLOTHING CO.
881 2018-12-24 20:27:42 In 2007 you said growth would soon be inflationary and suggested a new 4 year cycle for stocks was about to start.
882 2018-12-24 20:27:21 The 1% wants things to crash so they can grab even more control.

I'm 55 and not working.  Lost my wife last year and taking some time off.  I pulled my money out of stocks in June.  Lost some gains in the short term but it was obvious this nut case was going to case turmoil.
883 2018-12-24 20:27:20 I am looking forward to buying stocks for the next couple of months. Thanks to @cnn @MSNBC @FoxNews and their business models for making investing easy for those of us that can control our emotions.
884 2018-12-24 20:27:03 How long do you think the bear market on stocks could last? 2 years?
885 2018-12-24 20:26:48 I told you so. If Democrats take the House, it will be Stocks sell-off. Obama bad economy will come back. The American worker will lose the 401K. Retiring money. VOTE REPUBLICAN. Don’t trust any left-wing Democrat.
886 2018-12-24 20:26:35 SPY Statistics:  490/500 stocks were down today.  The SPY stock on the average is at least down by 30% from the 52-week high.  All the DOW 30 are down at least 10%, and most of them are down minimum 25%.  If this is not extraordinary - I don't have anything to say about it.
887 2018-12-24 20:26:27 Wanna protect the #DowJones, Mnuchin? Shut up. Tell your boss to shut up. Then sit back, let investors find value, let those investors start pumping up stocks again and let Trump take credit if he feels like it. They've already priced those tweets in...
888 2018-12-24 20:26:25 A Chrstmas gift to #KAG and #MAGA nation: You may never see blue chip stocks this cheap again. Fundementals are strong. Those who see through the hype stand to get deals of a lifetime. 
@realDonaldTrump
889 2018-12-24 20:26:01 Remember when Stocks go up its because of Obama two years ago, and if they go down it is just Trump’s fault. 

See how that works crazy “old man” Krugman? How does anyone believe you are an economist not a partisian hack??
890 2018-12-24 20:25:58 Why do human waited till last minutes to buy ingredients for their Christmas Dinner?? The longer you waited to more Chance that items will be out of stocks...
891 2018-12-24 20:25:56 
892 2018-12-24 20:25:18 Hey Paul, what’s the over/under on how long it takes trump to make the Fed buy stocks to support the stock market?
893 2018-12-24 20:24:17 The half of America that owns stocks are all losing a good bit of money today, and that half of America isn't all in the 1%.
894 2018-12-24 20:24:16 Wow, the sellers just won't let up will they? The S&P 500 is working on its fourth straight weekly decline and is now down 8 straight sessions. 

The $VIX soared 20% to $36 on Monday as stocks had their worst Christmas Eve trading session ever. 

What's going on?

$SPY $DIA $QQQ
895 2018-12-24 20:24:09 I've seen takes saying that collapsing stocks only hurts the wealthy, and takes saying that it hurts the middle class too. My parents are working class. They don't have stocks and don't have enough money saved up to retire. In the grand scheme of things, this is meaningless to us
896 2018-12-24 20:24:02 I have a bunch of small investments that make up the bulk of my portfolio with Stash. Easier to manage that way. The bigger individual stocks did a lot better.
897 2018-12-24 20:23:51 Glad to hear it.  But have you checked your #401K lately ? When we started this project, we had no idea stocks would take such a tumble  People calling it #TrumpCrash
898 2018-12-24 20:23:50 Pay for other militaries. Sell foreign countries military weapons. Then BANS BUMP STOCKS. You lost my vote and are probably a one term president. Only course of action you have now is to get the machine gun bans lifted.
899 2018-12-24 20:23:39 Now is the time to buy and hold stocks 
900 2018-12-24 20:22:31 Not very merry: US stocks plunge before Christmas - President Donald Trump's attack on the Federal Reserve spooked financial markets on Christmas Eve, raising fears about an uncertain future should the White House try to undermine or remove the head of the U.S. central bank
...
901 2018-12-24 20:21:48 Yup. It’s been my thesis for the past 2 yrs during the accumulation phase. When investors have neither stocks, nor bonds to hide, they will seek refuge in gold
902 2018-12-24 20:21:33 things I know about economics:

stocks = rich people, bad

no financial planning = everybody else in America, good
903 2018-12-24 20:21:17 My stocks have plummeted over the last 2 months. Fuck you Donald Trump
904 2018-12-24 20:21:12 the dems blame trump for loss of money stocks penions but sen harris Blumenthal coon and others  like poor jew schumer need to drink more beer then they can pee their money away
905 2018-12-24 20:21:08 The withdrawal of the stimulus by the Federal Reserve likely has something to do with the overvalued stocks plunging, and panic takes many more down with the bad stocks.  Now the Plunge Protection Team convenes to again decide how to inflate the economic bubble on Wall Street.
906 2018-12-24 20:21:02 How do you feel regarding a Boeing executive taking over as Defense Secretary? (I mean besides the obvious “it’s a great time to buy some Boeing stocks”)
907 2018-12-24 20:20:28 Always something bad to say. You make our stocks drop by not supporting what we the people want.
908 2018-12-24 20:20:24 working-class people are richer than me then if they're able to have stocks.
909 2018-12-24 20:19:51 Does anyone remember when President Obama was president. Trump said "I hope the stockmarket does go down because then I can buy!
(stocks and make more money)
And this is the child that is president
910 2018-12-24 20:19:39 How odd...Leftist said they hoped the economy crashed, they get a foothold in the House, the market begins to slide, the Fed ups the interest rates without reason, stocks slide more and now we are in a bear market with then left screaming to save the economy POTUS must go. Setup?
911 2018-12-24 20:19:07 Per the AP:  "The major indexes on Wall Street fell another 2 percent Monday, making it very possible that the market will end this month as the worst December for stocks since 1931."  #TrumpResign #TrumpResign #TrumpResign #TrumpResign #TrumpResign #TrumpResign #TrumpResign
912 2018-12-24 20:18:56 gun ,attention , and downright idiocy.  its sad she does not realize that its the homeless population and that city has 100 year old  sewers might have something to do with it.  

but yet if i dont want bump stocks  "im  tyrannic"
913 2018-12-24 20:18:54 Stocks over Cryptoeffingcurrencies
914 2018-12-24 20:18:54 Manufacturingthe Trump administration will ban bump stocks in the trial of the President tweeted a statement on the life of service.
915 2018-12-24 20:18:34 Stocks slump on Christmas Eve; S&P 500 nears bear market
916 2018-12-24 20:18:26 Get real. MOST Americans have no money in stocks.
917 2018-12-24 20:18:20 The short answer is yes.  And if the bear caught you by surprise given all the terrible news lately, you shouldn't be investing in stocks.
918 2018-12-24 20:18:17 This is  jerry, reporting on behalf of  CNN with your local business news. The Republicans are pushing legislation that could impact the future shares of  CAJ stocks. Thank you for tuning into  CNN.
919 2018-12-24 20:18:12 FED doesnt care about the market. Mostly Only already wealthy people own stocks. And if they fall, they will still survive pretty well. FED is worried about the economy as a whole. The real Bottom will be called when the QT starts affecting housing market. 1/2
920 2018-12-24 20:18:00 Redirected my contributions from cash to stocks last Friday! At these prices will be making automatic contribution. On the other hand the cash pile is over 100k...
921 2018-12-24 20:17:31 It is a logical error to compare bitcoin to stocks.  Some stocks may do well and some cryptos may do well.  Neither markets' success requires the other's failure.
922 2018-12-24 20:17:31 We are deep into bear market - SPY Facts:  All the SPY 500 stocks are down at least 8% from the 52-week high.  Average - 30% down.  Highest - 72.6% down, lowest - 8% down.  Best Performer - RHT.  Worst performer - NKTR.  Please like and follow if you like my data.  Thanks.
923 2018-12-24 20:17:20 No selling stocks to corporate bankers are how companies lose money. Stocks are investments banks make money off of. Every time a company makes a profit the bank gets a piece of it from owning the stock. Companies need to buy their stocks back from corporate bankers & 1%.
924 2018-12-24 20:17:18 We are now in a bear market. Here's what that means: quality stocks are on sale! Forget all the panic. Find good businesses and load up with every cent you can spare. History shows this is the time. Economy is strong. This drop will be seen as a HUGE windfall to smart investors.
925 2018-12-24 20:17:04 In PH they sell a lot of kpop albums, even the old ones. For some reason some CNA stores have stocks.
926 2018-12-24 20:16:49 That awkward moment when you realize rich people are the ones who sold and working class people hold stocks and that many safety nets are tied up in asset markets but you already got satisfaction from them losing value whoopsydaisy
927 2018-12-24 20:16:42 Dump all your stocks in Mt. Dew.
928 2018-12-24 20:16:08 Stocks are on sale right now for Christmas 
929 2018-12-24 20:15:46 It has already plunged.  SPY Facts:  All the SPY 500 stocks are down at least 8% from the 52-week high.  Average - 30% down.  Highest - 72.6% down, lowest - 8% down.  Best Performer - RHT.  Worst performer - NKTR.  Please like and follow if you like my datas.  Thanks.
930 2018-12-24 20:15:43 Stocks obviously oversold. When to get in and will we get a bounce and lower still or bottoming and rally?
931 2018-12-24 20:15:35 His cronies who shorted their stocks are loving it.
932 2018-12-24 20:15:30 I swear its true, kids who graduate college in a bull market think stocks only go up and that they should only go up, and now added to this they think the gov's job is to guarantee they only go up. #BrainToast #ScreenDamage
933 2018-12-24 20:15:24 I pulled my money out of stocks last month. Left it sitting in treasury bonds. It had already lost 6 months worth of my contributions when I moved it. I won't move it again until this shit is out of office.
934 2018-12-24 20:14:35 Oui, moi je suis taille plus et HM ont retirés leur section, old navy je sais pas y'en a jamais eu dans mon coin sauf récemment. Pour pour les jeux vidéos, ils font de la rareté on dirait, ya que Waltmart qui a les stocks si on a pas précommandé.
935 2018-12-24 20:14:31 Since you take credit for how well the country and stock market is doing it is time for you to take ownership of how poorly stocks are doing.  Now it is worse than 2008.  POS POTUS YOU NEED TO RESIGN.
936 2018-12-24 20:14:30 SPY Facts:  All the SPY 500 stocks are down at least 8% from the 52-week high.  Average - 30% down.  Highest - 72.6% down, lowest - 8% down.  Best Performer - RHT.  Worst performer - NKTR.  Please like and follow if you like my datas.  Thanks.
937 2018-12-24 20:14:22 Every stock market bottom has been marked by someone I know selling all their stocks.  The reason is always the same. "I had to because that money is my retirement".
938 2018-12-24 20:14:13 What’s up with the stock market this year, playing with my money fam. Hoping 2019 stocks get better 
939 2018-12-24 20:13:59 If you don’t own any stocks, now’s the time to start a Roth IRA and buy buy buy!

The greatest adventure is prudently investing your copper pieces.
940 2018-12-24 20:13:20 Aren't stocks still up? Plus if you have good risk management then you should still be up
941 2018-12-24 20:13:10 @realDonaldTrump I here your all alone in the white house waiting for a reply well you have a long wait for you to watch your stocks go down on you ps  Trump when you take a dump and a lump you pump out of your rump  dont forget to  close the bathroom door asshole
942 2018-12-24 20:12:27 People, @realDonaldTrump wants the stocks to crash. It creates more “enemies” for him to rail against.
943 2018-12-24 20:12:12 Now is when you want to buy stocks. Invest!
944 2018-12-24 20:12:09 @AskRobinhood hello, I was invested in CEI and the reverse split occurred where I had 1721 stocks in it and than reduced to only 73 stocks. I ended up losing $60 of what I originally had before investing into this stock. I was up $3,500 and have pictures/screenshots to prove it.
945 2018-12-24 20:11:59 I’m deadass considering selling all my stocks....like mannnn wtf is going on smdh
946 2018-12-24 20:11:39 You are going to go down with him.  He’s even losing his base . By the way, what’s he doing for your retirement account.?
Have you seen stocks lately? Bet his working class base isn’t happy with this Christmas Eve stock report.
947 2018-12-24 20:11:03 Stocks like Microsoft and the Health Care Index seem late to this selling orgy. While Treasury Bonds have been the inverse of the market for this spell.
948 2018-12-24 20:10:55 These are some other stocks I "nibbled" on the day before Christmas: $BG @ $51.85, $SAFM @ $95.00, $BAC @ $23.05, $SINA @ $52.00, $JBSS @ $56.69, and $SON @ $50.79. Also, shorted $VXX @ $48.85.
949 2018-12-24 20:10:54 speakin of world history....the dow stocks is down more than its EVER been in history..#RealFacts
950 2018-12-24 20:10:47 Is the @DowJones kind of like @realDonaldTrump’s #christmas gift to the nation? #stocks
951 2018-12-24 20:10:35 @realDonaldTrump Rasmussen Daily Presidential Tracking Poll (“One of the best” your words) has you at 46%!  Stocks are falling, resignations are happening (rats need off the sinking ship), & now Gov is shutdown. YOU ARE A DUMPSTER FIRE! #Unfit4Office #ResignTrump
952 2018-12-24 20:10:31 My stocks are doing really bad. Too bad to sell, got to ride it out I guess. Here's hoping healthcare stabilizes
953 2018-12-24 20:10:21 Didn’t say it’s gone bearish due to use metrics. Made the point that just like stocks, the crypto pullback does not fairly reflect real value of the network.
954 2018-12-24 20:10:20 tfw you’re relieved to have been a failure in life and don’t own any stocks because those that do seem upset
955 2018-12-24 20:10:11 The Fed has nothing to do with the Stocks falling.  The stocks are falling due to your incompetence and wishy washy nature.  Hire someone in the @WhiteHouse who understands economics, will you? If you don't, it is even more clear to us you work for PUTIN!
956 2018-12-24 20:10:10 So let’s translate what you’re saying. When stocks go up it’s all on you and when stocks drop, it’s all on the Fed. How can you expect anyone take you seriously? How? You are a pathetic child playing in the bunker while you should be trying to get the ball back on the fairway
957 2018-12-24 20:09:50 At least stocks have intrinsic value.
958 2018-12-24 20:09:45 People who knew something was coming and shorted the stocks?
959 2018-12-24 20:09:44 IMO it's not incompetence. it's manipulation-- the money isn't on fire, it's lost from middle class portfolios like retirement accounts while rich hedge funds can grab windfall by shorting stocks, rich are getting richer off this chaos which is why they allow it to continue
960 2018-12-24 20:09:39 Wonder if he sold short on stocks?
961 2018-12-24 20:09:28 Stocks are long term investments unless you do penny stocks which you are probably expert at.
962 2018-12-24 20:08:38 Merry Christmas! I'm really interested in Dan's take on Cannabis stocks after today's action
963 2018-12-24 20:08:36 Markets stage one of worst Christmas Eves ever, closing down more than 600 points as Trump blames Fed for stock losses in a tweet
The decline marked one of the worst Christmas Eves ever for U.S. stocks. President Trump tried to assign sole blame
964 2018-12-24 20:08:10 Right you are. The stock market never recovers. All that money is gone for good. Think again. Rich people are now shorting big stocks. When the market rebounds, they make their money back and then some. But sure...rejoice. because a down matket affects only rich people
965 2018-12-24 20:08:05 You know what's more crazy? Wanting a border wall/security over more serious problems, like gun regulations, unemployment aid, Puerto Rico...the list keeps piling on. Adding to that, the stocks fell after you blamed the feds.

But continue being your grumpy self, Scrooge.
966 2018-12-24 20:07:56 @DanaBashCNN It's obvious what Trump and Mnuchin are doing.  Crooked Mnuchin made that call to banks to tank the economy.  They then buy up $millions in stocks.  When the market recovers they have made out like the bandits they are.
967 2018-12-24 20:07:20 America gave a mf that bankrupted 6 casinos control of a 21T dollar economy. We actually did this shit. 
#trumpslump #stocks @realDonaldTrump #MAGA
968 2018-12-24 20:07:04 Any1 considered that Trump & the billionaires hes been courting 4 decades may actually benefit from a crash of the economy?  If their $$ is liquid they can buy up stocks & businesses during & after the fallout.  Consolidation.  One step closer to monopolies. Just a thought.
969 2018-12-24 20:07:00 Question: If you’re in a cash position and the stock market goes down by 50%, how much did you beat a person who remained in stocks?
970 2018-12-24 20:06:48 I hate to say it, but I am glad I moved most of my stock portfolio to Asia a few years ago. I still own some blue-chip stocks in the States which should weather any potential downturn.
971 2018-12-24 20:06:47 High record of stocks for two years and still all you people do is whine and think you have ideas of better policies. If your so fuking smart why are you not President?
972 2018-12-24 20:06:34 Yikes! Looks like I should’ve gotten my family super discounted stocks for Christmas.
973 2018-12-24 20:06:31 The Federal Reserve raised rates & it's the end of the year.

Not Trumps Fault

Tell me about your stocks, I'm all ears

I'm not selling anything.

No guts no glory
974 2018-12-24 20:06:28 Yeah, I guess this is why house prices bottomed years (!) after stocks in GFC. Yet they rebounded first after DotCom, so it's not super obvious either.
975 2018-12-24 20:06:11 In my opinion only the rich have the where with all and portfolio to be able to short stocks.  Not all rich are wrong, but in shorting the market it's not the middle class doing it.  I am aware of many wealthy doing magnanimous things.
976 2018-12-24 20:05:49 How many times have stocks fallen this year...
977 2018-12-24 20:05:32 I wonder how many Republican insiders are making bank by shorting stocks over the holidays? Hot tips from Charlie Tuna Mnuchin?
978 2018-12-24 20:05:24 Much is in your retirement crisis video. It’s the end of the delusion that stocks will bail us out not actual wealth accumulation. I see a mirror image of the last few years—- persistent and unrelenting—- until the news is so bad a low can be formed.
979 2018-12-24 20:05:22 What a Christmas gift. Government shutdown and crashing stocks. Just what we all expected when he said #MAGA.
980 2018-12-24 20:05:16 Please stop tweeting,  stocks keeps going down!!!  Noticed you haven't mentioned that.  And obviously you should have someone there to edit your tweets.
981 2018-12-24 20:05:06 Their money is not in stocks or bonds. It's cash from corporations and real estate.
982 2018-12-24 20:05:04 Ya my Robin Hood penny stocks are down down down
983 2018-12-24 20:05:03 Markets made a few assumptions from late 2016 till now, all of which unravelled this month- (a) The adults (Cohn, Kelly, Mattis, Ryan, McConnell et al.) will be able to contain Trump (b) Fed will step in and save the markets as soon as stocks fell ~10%+
984 2018-12-24 20:04:45 Get this SOB out of the White House! Stocks are doing the worst in history!! Every American losing!
985 2018-12-24 20:04:19 Stocks down, crypto up
986 2018-12-24 20:04:03 Can't stack them until you sell...
987 2018-12-24 20:03:20 @realDonaldTrump doesn’t know what he is doing. Equities are low. Didn’t he use to say the “the stocks market is at all time high” what a joke
988 2018-12-24 20:03:07 Answer: the Republicans have garaunteed incomes not effected by trump policies and an inside track on stocks being manipulated
989 2018-12-24 20:03:04 $spy stocks in my portfolio that were up today; $pets $ccgc $lgf/a $snap all are screaming buys and all are takeover canididates; posted just in case you are looking for new longs,
990 2018-12-24 20:02:55 The only people having a shitty day with stocks are bad investors and regular people with 401k’s, IRA’s, pensions, etc. Retirement funds aren’t usually actively managed to the point where they’ll save loses in market situations like we’re seeing now. 
991 2018-12-24 20:02:52 With all due respect, measured in gold, stocks are in an uptrend Mr. Brandt. Stocks could go down but if gold would go even deeper, how would you compare this episode with 1930s?
992 2018-12-24 20:02:33 The deep operators who are not happy about DJT victory are squeezing the fed to increase rates and destroy trump any way they can. But as long as POTUS keeps strong the American people will stand by him. Factories jobs  and businesses are economic indicators not Stocks/Gambling

994 2018-12-24 20:01:31 Stocks?
995 2018-12-24 20:01:17 But on the other hand, anybody that thinks that Facebook or Google or any other of those tech stocks is worth more than $0.10 a share deserves to lose everything they invested.
996 2018-12-24 20:00:04 Loose tweets sink stocks.
997 2018-12-24 20:00:01 Do I have any friends working with trades (stocks, bonds, commodities, derivatives and mutual funds). I’m seeking for advice reading the current marketing signs.
998 2018-12-24 19:59:54 Would i jus be better off giving my money to a pro than to buy my own stocks on the stash app?
999 2018-12-24 19:59:42 They say you can’t succeed with a market timing strategy. But imagine if you could drive down the stock market at will with a mere tweet, then have your minions buy stocks for you in the resulting bear market!
1000 2018-12-24 19:59:27 I never bought stocks. Just looking at the history of the stock market, I'm not too worried until it reaches back down to late 2015/early 2016 levels. So far it could simply be a temporary dip in the market similar to the end of 2011.

1002 2018-12-24 19:59:19 I know that most of us are too poor to own stocks, but the ripples from today's financial disaster will be felt by everyone. This is of far more consequence than anything else trending today, and will have lasting effects on the economy. And guess who owns it?
1003 2018-12-24 19:59:13 Tax loss selling the stocks you bought a week ago as a tax loss selling play
1004 2018-12-24 19:59:08 Trump is Running this country in the ground. Look at the Stocks- Having a Crappy merry Christmas. The Tariffs& Trade Deals that trump screwed up with China. Now; he's talking about pulling the Troops out. We did that B4. Remember the ppl;Hollering lock her up.Where the chants Now
1005 2018-12-24 19:58:39 let's check and see who is shorting stocks

1011 2018-12-24 19:57:50 Consecutive quarters of negative GDP, we’re about to average better than 3% for the year.  This sell off is bs.  It’s investors dumping stocks of corporations that leveraged up on too much cheap debt and will have problems paying back the debt with higher rates.
1012 2018-12-24 19:57:38 Are you saying his base doesn't have 401k's, or that they have them and they don't understand them? Because if you're saying they have them, then they have stocks.

1020 2018-12-24 19:56:53 Stocks plunged Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 653 points following President Trump's tweet attacking the Federal Reserve and its independence. @WCBD
1021 2018-12-24 19:56:43 Scrooge, because I do own some stocks.
1022 2018-12-24 19:56:43 Perhaps it’s a coordinated effort to short stocks and make a profit. It makes sense to buy when stocks are low right?
1023 2018-12-24 19:56:39 How does the Fed stopping treasury purchases and raising rates leave no bid for stocks? "Liquidity being taken out of the market"
1024 2018-12-24 19:56:20 now all the rich ppl will buy cheap stocks and get even richer when they inevitably come back up yay what a cool system
1025 2018-12-24 19:56:16 The problem I see is few recognize how wrong it is for politicians to even be concerned about stock markets. Why should stock markets factor into a discussion about fiscal budgets? They've occluded the idea of savings to signify stocks rather than a personally accountable money.
1026 2018-12-24 19:56:14 Stocks crashing
Oil crashing
Risk appetite is at it's minimum
Treasury yields at minimum
Dollar is heavier than a rock

1027 2018-12-24 19:55:35 Thoughts on the #PlungeProtectionTeam they prob are buying stocks specifically bank stocks. Also, buying puts to offset their losses. Get it? Stabilizing markets and also profiting on the options... sneaky sneaky!
1028 2018-12-24 19:55:29 You must have bought your stocks in that 1929 dip.
1029 2018-12-24 19:55:01 So comments supersede the KKK? You still have a job. He can still perform. You do stocks don’t they include numbers? The math don’t add up! Such a loser comment!
1030 2018-12-24 19:55:01 which means it's time to put a little money into #altcoins again. when stocks go down, coins like @ethereum & @litecoin get some decent bumps.
1031 2018-12-24 19:54:42 Unless trumpy is telling Don Jr. & Eric to short sell stocks or index ETFs, then creating chaos, knowing markets will tank in response to the uncertainty. 

If so, R.I.C.O. should confiscate their assets & imprison for life.
1032 2018-12-24 19:54:37 Yep, the algorithm technique really knows how to suck out the life of stocks.
1033 2018-12-24 19:54:27 When a trustee or Superintendent speaks of privatizing retirement, remember: "It’s very possible that the market will end this month as the worst December for stocks since 1931." Not a Merry Christmas for 401K people, through no fault of their own. #ThankGod4CTA #WeAreCTA
1034 2018-12-24 19:54:27 You could tell everyone fake mad on stocks bc I don't see this energy on bitcoin's collapse
1035 2018-12-24 19:54:26 Yet not a word about the ban on bump stocks you wanted. Not a single lawsuit filed for ALL the UNCONSTITUTIONAL LAWS the NRA has supported in the past. Top brass needs to resign and let real men fight for our right to have modern day machine guns. Not a penny from me until then.
1036 2018-12-24 19:54:23 Buffett on Bloomberg TV says stocks are cheap
1037 2018-12-24 19:54:22 On the other hand, you have a great "feel for the market".  You know how to make stocks tumble with a single Tweet.
1038 2018-12-24 19:54:00 No..he’s not. Hes why the world,even the mess in the Middle East is getting worse,stocks sharted their pants today and we are adrift. We need a cleansing..hopefully Jan will start that process.
1039 2018-12-24 19:53:59 Trumpets be like: “Whoever Dow Jones is, he’s a deep state libtard liar! Stocks actually went up 1200 points today! My step uncle Bubba said so!”

Narrator: Bubba was also a moron.
1040 2018-12-24 19:53:57 I’m old enough to remember when ppl said #Trump won b/c of #EconomicAnxiety (despite Obama getting us out of recession). 

Right now: Stocks crashing. 401k’s disappearing. Trump is ATTACKING Fed Chair. Mnuchin is checking bank liquidity. 

This feels pretty anxiety-inducing. No?
1041 2018-12-24 19:53:55 I feel great the day I buy. I feel like cheap the following days when my stocks go down and after a gut renching period I convince myself that the only thing I can do is wait and see. The future is out of my hands. 

After a longer time the future comes and I see if I was right..
1042 2018-12-24 19:53:51 I can’t sell my stocks fast enough. I thought I could take today off but no, idiot Trump is still finding ways to destablize everything. And I’ve been saying Merry Chrismas since I was a small kid and no one ever complained.
1043 2018-12-24 19:53:38 Stop this nonsense. Unless someone can prove with evidence & facts that Trump or his friends on a large scale invested in shorting stocks just prior to the bear market stop spreading this conspiracy...please! Focus on #Russiagate and stopping this presidency. That is all thanks!
1044 2018-12-24 19:53:27 Trump and Congress in the last two weeks. 
1. Made bump stocks illegal
2. legalized industrial hemp
3. Pulled troops out of Syria
4. Prison reform
5. Signed pro-farm bill

Remember, when stocks go up, it's proof of Trump's genius, but when they go down, it's someone else's fault. Probably a conspiracy by the deep state's allies, the deep private sector.
1050 2018-12-24 19:52:53 They know their bizarre behavior will negatively affect markets - anyone “in on it” is likely shorting stocks and making a ton of cash....
1051 2018-12-24 19:52:39 Each time it's tried moving even just $40 of $50 Billion, the Markets freaked out. Hit their Stocks, they sting. Hit their Bonds and they spiral into freefall.
1052 2018-12-24 19:52:22 Washington Post says December is usually a healthy month for stocks, but this month has been the worst since 1931. Great depression!

1055 2018-12-24 19:51:56 19 of 19 major banks predict stocks will be up in 2019 yet only 40% of Americans feel the same. Who is right? No one really knows. That’s why your portfolio should be designed to meet your needs regardless of who is right!
1056 2018-12-24 19:51:40 It’s not a assumption. Charities /Foundations advertise tax shelters, investments that they do make a profit from and pay no taxes. By charities investing in stocks with donors $, they received a good return. As long as they spend 5-10% on the charity, rest go to Admin-some donor
1057 2018-12-24 19:51:19 To be clear I’m not US based so a global tracker includes 50-60% US stocks for me.
1058 2018-12-24 19:51:13 $XLF financials led the way. Then $IWM small caps followed, then the $QQQ techs. There are still lot of sectors and stocks out there that can be pounded.

$SPX
1059 2018-12-24 19:51:09 We just hit a bear market which is 20% down. Average bear market is 30.7% down. Looking for the DOW at 18,800 if this is average. Probably a lot more blood out there. Cash is better than stocks right now it appears.
1060 2018-12-24 19:51:03 Over the past 65 years, the start of bull markets & big rallies in Gold stocks coincided w/the start of rate cuts.

1063 2018-12-24 19:50:53 You'll read things like "stocks are fairly priced now" but mkts pretty much always overshoot both ways
1064 2018-12-24 19:49:52 So about my stocks... 
1065 2018-12-24 19:49:42 The Fed is a private banking corporation whose stocks are owned by adrenochrome addicted Rothschilds, and other zionist banking families.
They admitted to causing the Great Depression by reducing the money supply by a third. 
Too many pedovore banking elites trying to fight back.
1066 2018-12-24 19:49:31 I need to know this i been trying to get in stocks for a while
1067 2018-12-24 19:49:30 Rich are shorting stocks and making a fkn killing.
1068 2018-12-24 19:49:14 Economic lessons we learned again in 2018:
1) tariffs are anti-growth;
2) exploding national debt is anti-growth;
3) restricting immigration is anti-growth;
4) policy chaos is anti-growth;
5) undermining the central bank is anti-growth;
6) anti-growth policies are bad for stocks.
1069 2018-12-24 19:49:12 Lovely analogy. Anyhoo- Dow plunging is all on U. And nobody but.
Interesting how u only take credit 4 something that is favorable (even if it’s not of ur doing.) Shutdown also on U- per your orders. Merry Christmas Prez.
“Dow plunges in worst Christmas Eve for stocks in history”
1070 2018-12-24 19:48:49 We are getting close to another global crash, stocks are only going one way!

1072 2018-12-24 19:48:26 And they will still be able buy up a disproportionate number of the devalued stocks unlike the rest of us who will have all lost our retirement funds.
1073 2018-12-24 19:48:17 That's why value stocks are usually good. Last 1.5 years have been weird there.
But always mutual funds.
1074 2018-12-24 19:48:13 Or stocks, they’re all on sale right now.
1075 2018-12-24 19:48:12 Dow Jones - all the 30 stocks are down today; interestingly, all of them are down at least 10% from 52-week high.  KO being the best performer at 10% down from highs and the worst GS - down 43.2% from 52-week high.  Next two - AAPL and IBM down 37% each.  BEARs are on a roll
1076 2018-12-24 19:48:12 Worst Christmas Eve in stock market history!   Worst December for stocks since December of 1931!   Trump is to stupid to be president.
1077 2018-12-24 19:48:00 Well, FYI: I had stocks when Obama was President. I cashed in from that recession and then later...the stocks increased by $2,000. Maybe I should have hung in there. LOL!!

1080 2018-12-24 19:47:55 Your PRESIDENT told them not to raise interest rates... And I believe stocks started tanking when Democrats won the House....
1081 2018-12-24 19:47:50 I am okay for now.  I have mine in 3 pots.

A) Short term accounts I will be using in next 7 years-cash and TIAA and real estate.
B) MidRange-Conservative stocks, Cash and bonds-7-14 years.
C) Long Range All stock-
Yeah, I stashed extra cash when Trump was elected.
1082 2018-12-24 19:47:34 Absolutely. Secular markets are decades long. There can be cyclical bulls (like stocks were in) but the overall secular bear is marked by a few things... but mainly below average returns (but doesn’t have to be negative for the entire period)
1083 2018-12-24 19:47:30 Market officials have weighted stocks so when they go up they drag the whole mkt index higher then it would have gone but when they go down they also drag the whole index lower then it would have gone so more volatility & fear for investors
1084 2018-12-24 19:47:17 Just a little tip. Nothing big will happen on the stocks today. For two reasons. First one: Well it Christmas Eve and nobody really want to play with stocks. Secondly: The stock market will close early. But their maybe some change in the stocks.
1085 2018-12-24 19:47:14 You don’t own any stocks long term? Just trade?
1086 2018-12-24 19:46:47 Haha! Shitty feeling is just beginning Hoss. Wtf!

1088 2018-12-24 19:46:41 Stock market "tanked" after Dems took the house by a small margin. How about you give up your salary like @POTUS does? Me, I'm increasing my positions on undervalued stocks. Thanks, @realDonaldTrump. Merry Christmas to all of us!
1089 2018-12-24 19:46:33 @POTUS you’re making us lose money in the stocks please resign
1090 2018-12-24 19:46:30 So what happened Dopey? Did Mnunchkin tell you to short your stocks again today - something about Mnunchkin making crazy calls yesterday? Forget Rudolph, Mueller is coming for you.
1091 2018-12-24 19:46:22 2) to be due to corporate debt so if that started blowing up at a high valuation say mid 3000s I’d pull out. Monthly payments will always keep going into stocks. By and large I’m looking to buy and hold with occasional withdrawals to try and boost performance rather thab trade.
1092 2018-12-24 19:46:06 “You need to tweet about how you just found out your 401k is ‘in the stocks’” - my dad after he complained that the stocks dropped again and I said, “who do we know in the stocks?”

1094 2018-12-24 19:45:29 There once was a leader named Trump
Whose economy went into a slump
While he screamed for a wall
Stocks continued to fall
And now everyone knows he’s a chump
1095 2018-12-24 19:45:26 I'd sure be interested in knowing who in the administration shorted a ton of stocks over the last couple of weeks.
1096 2018-12-24 19:45:16 Remember, when stocks go up, it's proof of Trump's genius, but when they go down, it's someone else's fault. Probably a conspiracy by the deep state's allies, the deep private sector.
1097 2018-12-24 19:44:39 Now that Dems @DNC control the house the Trump recovery is over. Stocks down due to the Dems control.  Too late to drain the swamp.
1098 2018-12-24 19:44:39 All the CEOs who bought back company stocks at higher prices are NOT happy with Trump.   EVERYONE is losing money.   How long can @senatemajldr allow this mess?  Congress will have to override any presidential veto.  #ToddlerTrump will NOT get better.  @FOXNEWS is now in charge.
1099 2018-12-24 19:44:30 My stocks went down with Obama....and then it climbed back with an increase of $2,000!! Just a bunch of rich, filthy traders using the market to their advantage. Not us small peons.
1100 2018-12-24 19:44:15 Do you understand economics? Any middle class worker with a 401k are all dying on the inside because of this. Rich people are happy these stocks are tumbling because they go in and buy at low cost and wait until it goes back up. Please educate yourself dude
1101 2018-12-24 19:44:09 MMs toying around with Oil stocks investors ,this has been brutal and relentless this time around
1102 2018-12-24 19:43:56 1) I’m not sure why you look at Dow isn’t that like 30 stocks measured by share price rather than market cap? I assume you mean a high value. I’d pull the 40% back out at 3000. The other 60% maybe at some point I look at things like debt levels etc. I expect the next crisis
1103 2018-12-24 19:43:52 He’s Jewish, so he watches it like a hawk. Stocks good? Thanks to Dark Lord Cheeto. Who’s to blame if the stocks are bad? Liberals, Democrats and/ or Obama or Clinton.
1104 2018-12-24 19:43:45 As long as the economy is doing well they said... as long as the stocks aren’t effected they said... as long as the govt stays open they said... Merry Christmas #maga #trumpresign #TrumpShutown #Trumpcrash #TrumpChristmasShutdown

1110 2018-12-24 19:42:46 There probably will be an announcement soon (likely via Twitter) which will send the stocks back up! Someone’s holding the strings! :)
1111 2018-12-24 19:42:41 So sorry to hear it. Usually what drops the most, more or less, rises the most on the other side. Be careful. Moving into defensive stocks after a drop isn’t as painful as moving into cash but is pretty painful.
1112 2018-12-24 19:42:12 I never did options trade Bob. Only stocks. Is this something for people like me as well? Thanks for all that you do and Happy Holidays to you and your family.
1113 2018-12-24 19:42:07 When stocks go up, you take credits but when they go down, why was your F*** mouth?
1114 2018-12-24 19:41:50 @realDonaldTrump I like how bump stocks help defend people from the gov. being dictorial and taking bump stocks without the authority. Just because your on a roll right now should we turn a blind eye to this issue.
1115 2018-12-24 19:41:16 Funny thing is that if Trump were an actual evil genius he could have made a fortune shorting stocks but because his own incompetence played a role he and his friends are now poorer.
1116 2018-12-24 19:41:10 How low do you think property values will drop. Or do you mean stocks only
1117 2018-12-24 19:41:07 Indeed.  Stocks = perception.  That perception then impacts the actual economy.
1118 2018-12-24 19:41:04 @Twitter You don’t have anything to worry about. As soon as I get some money to buy stocks, 100+ shares, right here. 
1119 2018-12-24 19:40:57 A gentle reminder... if you would like one this go round, time is of the essence, as stocks are EXTREMELY limited... and moving fast!!
1120 2018-12-24 19:40:52 The SEC should be doing a forensic analysis to see if trump n friends are benefiting from just that. Apparently, bin laden had shorted airline stocks right before 9/11, so it’s not unprecedented
1121 2018-12-24 19:40:31 Me either, but people hear it's down and panic and the effect spreads to non-DJIA stocks.
1122 2018-12-24 19:40:30 Stocks were doing ok until Dems won Congress,
1123 2018-12-24 19:40:15 Actually, he is doing exactly that.  Inflating stocks since elected, and spreading it out over the unsuspecting retail investors, creating havoc in the US, imposing tariffs, on and off, has created the volatility needed to succeed in sending Joe/Jane public bankrupt, soon.
1124 2018-12-24 19:40:08 Or if you are short growth stocks
1125 2018-12-24 19:39:32 Dow Jones - all the 30 stocks are down today; interestingly, all of them are down at least 10% from 52-week high.  KO being the best performer at 10% down from highs and the worst GS - down 43.2% from 52-week high.  Next two - AAPL and IBM down 37% each.  BEARs are on a roll
1126 2018-12-24 19:39:21 Short stocks buy crypto
1127 2018-12-24 19:39:04 We’ll be trading worthless stock certificate papers as currency in GITMO. Eg I’ll give you a thousand GE stocks for 1 kg of quinoa.
1128 2018-12-24 19:38:59 For Christmas I would LOVE for stocks to stop dropping lol
1129 2018-12-24 19:38:51 I think thus is what trunp wanted so that he and his people can buy stocks cheaper
1130 2018-12-24 19:38:39 54 percent of Americans are invested in US stocks but all Americans will pay for the downturn since companies will eventually raise prices to compensate for losses. The market losses threaten to push the economy into recession.
1131 2018-12-24 19:38:35 on the worst day of Christmas this hell year gave to me, big stocks a-crashing, bad takes a-tweeting, and a spacey vid I don’t wanna see 
1132 2018-12-24 19:38:28 I sure picked a great year to invest heavier in stocks.
1133 2018-12-24 19:38:19 Stocks will go higher and you will get richer because they will respond to earnings and not politics (eventually). Hope you made the best picks!
1134 2018-12-24 19:38:17 3 or 4 stocks
1135 2018-12-24 19:38:13 Does this mean there will be a Mueller rally?
#markets #stocks
1136 2018-12-24 19:38:06 ThatTrump puts this  on Dems is absurd.  They had a unanimous agreement until Fox News re-wrote his mindset.   As for the stocks  he can look at his own actions. When will hit base figure out that his businesses are money pits & now he’s bankrupting the country?
1137 2018-12-24 19:38:03 Yea I just can’t look . Too scared . Eventually things will go up . Today was a shortened market day , a swift kick to the balls -DOW down over 600 points . I won’t look at my stocks for a long while
1138 2018-12-24 19:37:58 Contrary to popular magat belief, falling stocks are bad.
1139 2018-12-24 19:37:49 Down 25% on stocks. Merry fuckin Chrysler
1140 2018-12-24 19:37:38 Everybody out of money to buy stocks or any other risk.
1141 2018-12-24 19:37:28 Here's an idea. Fire the chair of the Fed.  That'll show the markets!
BTW. The SEC tracks stocks. Your shorting games will be discovered.
1142 2018-12-24 19:37:26 I would not be surprised if this was a plan by Trump so he and his cronies can now swoop in and by a bunch of stocks at a low price and then later sell it high after his impeachment/resignation. Manipulation of the market...add it to the list of crimes.
1143 2018-12-24 19:37:07 Yes, I'm doing fine. I started pulling money out of mutual funds and selling stocks last Feb.  I'm about 80% out and in getting a nice safe 2.5-3%.  The stock market is an interest rate play except for select stocks.  You really are a putz.
1144 2018-12-24 19:37:02 Trump will probably say the Fed is against him and partisan and why stocks are down. Disgraceful.
1145 2018-12-24 19:36:44 What are some good stocks to get into for the short term, Mr. Woods? Thoughts?
1146 2018-12-24 19:36:29 Starting to see a pattern here. When Rs are in office they give the rich tax cuts and tank the economy. Then the rich peeps buy the shit that tanks, like stocks. Then they make money from it when it recovers during a D admin. 
1147 2018-12-24 19:36:02 Dow Jones - all the 30 stocks are down today; interestingly, all of them are down at least 10% from 52-week highs.  KO being the best performer at 10% down from highs and the worst being GS - down 43.2% from 52-week high.  Next two - AAPL and IBM down 37% each.  BEAR is on a roll
1148 2018-12-24 19:35:53 Made $60 today trading in #stocks and another $100 trading in #btc there is money to be made. You just have to be diligent enough to look for it.
1149 2018-12-24 19:35:48 1-month in a minimum 30-year retirement savings period (including the spending phase) is 0.28% of the total period... if you had basis to be in stocks, then PLEASE ignore (your future self says thanks)
1150 2018-12-24 19:35:43 I knew it would happen so I sold all my stocks with profit earlier
1151 2018-12-24 19:35:18 Oooh, Markets dive over 600 Points, worst Christmas Eve ever. Joy to the World, as long as you don't have a stock heavy 401K. 
#MarketsDive #stocks #SP500 #TrumpShutdown #TrumpResign #ResignTrump
1152 2018-12-24 19:35:07 Been trading stocks for 30 years. Trump has destroyed 
Obama’s stock market that he inherited. Now with 
Trumps stupidity , he has CRASHED the MARKET !
1153 2018-12-24 19:35:05 Also I own zero stocks on the DJIA so it is not an indicator for how I'm doing.
1154 2018-12-24 19:35:05 Switch over to miner stocks and physical silver to get it back. Markets not done dropping
1155 2018-12-24 19:35:00 My wife stocks up for me when she visits her brother in Austin. My daughter has me put it on salmon.
1156 2018-12-24 19:34:58 Stocks have always been volatile bro. You gain this week,lose next week. Dem go dey alright 
1157 2018-12-24 19:34:40 U.S. stocks close far lower again on Monday 12/24/18 $DJIA -2.91% at 21,792.20, $SPX -2.71% at 2,351.10, $COMPQ -2.21% at 6,192.92, $RUT -1.95% at $1266.92.
1158 2018-12-24 19:34:32 #WallStreet stocks plunged for a fourth straight session Monday amid rising doubts over the US economy after Treasury Secretary Steven #Mnuchin’s efforts to reassure investors fell flat.
1159 2018-12-24 19:34:11 Are any trumps shorting stocks???? @SEC_News @SEC_Enforcement
1160 2018-12-24 19:34:08 I made barely anything on apple and such, then i got lucky and made like $600 on weed stocks, then when a bunch of tech stocks dropped i lost like 1/3 of my total profit lol
1161 2018-12-24 19:33:56 Short or Long? socks or stocks?
1162 2018-12-24 19:33:33 pathological liar nerd dudes always talk about how much they love to invest in stocks
1163 2018-12-24 19:32:45 For Christmas this year, Trump just put all our stocks on last minute clearance sale. Stock up now before the holidays are over! #MerryChristmas
1164 2018-12-24 19:32:39 trump actually had a really great week alot of good stuff just happend. pulling troops from Syria and half from Afghanistan not to mention making bump stocks illegal or legalizing hemp farming. And he is going to pass a bill that will reform the criminal justice system.
1165 2018-12-24 19:32:35 Rambling ... incoherent ... definitely Trumpian!
Those witches, the ones in the Village stocks, in jail, or headed there by wagon ... they're to blame. Blame them. It'll make you feel better!
1166 2018-12-24 19:32:35 “Individual 1” has managed to cause all major stocks to spiral down except one...Barak Obama’s stock is skyrocketing.
1167 2018-12-24 19:32:34 There are also some great deals in stocks right now.
1168 2018-12-24 19:32:33 Dow Jones - all the 30 stocks are down today; interestingly, all of them are down at least 10% from 52-week highs.  KO being the best performer at 10% down from highs and the worst being GS - down 43.2% from 52-week high.  Next two - AAPL and IBM down 37% each.  BEAR is on a roll
1169 2018-12-24 19:32:29 It’ll recover. They’ve had shutdowns before. Stocks will recover too
1170 2018-12-24 19:32:24 If you look at stocks right now Obama is beating you
1171 2018-12-24 19:32:17 Yeah. Shoulda sold my stocks.
1172 2018-12-24 19:32:15 Separating children from their parents, a migrant child dying in US custody, shutting down the government, none of these things led to the GOP abandoning Trump, but when it affects their wallets and stocks ...maybe , just maybe.
1173 2018-12-24 19:32:05 December is usually a healthy month for stocks, but this month has been the worst since 1931.
1174 2018-12-24 19:31:57 Glad I sold all my stocks and emptied my 401k before the market crashed. I donated it all to #BuildthatFreakinWall #MAGA I love @realDonaldTrump I don’t care how dumb he is, I’ll always be dumber.
1175 2018-12-24 19:31:44 Stocks can bounce with some notes V goddamn lol
1176 2018-12-24 19:31:32 I would leave picking  not stocks to the old SLAMer
1177 2018-12-24 19:31:08 Makes me curious with the Dow dropping so much ,  Trump and his rich friends are able to buy stocks low and make a lot of money.
1178 2018-12-24 19:31:02 The economy isn't booming, it's average. The tax cuts did nothing for the average person, stocks don't work if you have to cash out. Above all, pay is too damn low and the price of things are too high! #ShutdownStories
1179 2018-12-24 19:30:52 Did you ask Peltz if he is buying stocks today. Doubt it.
1180 2018-12-24 19:30:44 I want to know if Trump or any of the family members dumped stocks before all of the DOW losses while Trump created uncertainty. I also want to know if he or his family reinvests when it hits a low.
1181 2018-12-24 19:30:39 Jeff Gundlach makes comments about individual stocks.  You do not. You just talk about asset based inflation, dooms-day scnenario, gold, gold, gold gold, bubble, gold, gold, gold.  Fast Money Trading at CNBC is about trading ideas which you have offered none.
1182 2018-12-24 19:30:25 Thanks for your comment ! If by knowledge you mean picking right stock, then even best stocks like GE got banged beyond sustenance level to test the patience of even most courageous ones. By knowledge, did u mean hedging or staying in cash during such events to keep afloat?
1183 2018-12-24 19:30:12 The Federal Reserve is attempting to undo Trump’s accomplishments through raising interest rates. Stocks have tumbled as a result. Deep State control.
1184 2018-12-24 19:30:07 UM It was a late day call to bank CEOs. But that's ok., newspaper and media stocks are on the chipping block,. As it is painfully apparent you can't get your shit together.  Short all media stocks. Refuse to do business with advertisers.
1185 2018-12-24 19:30:06 My stocks are in the !
1186 2018-12-24 19:29:59 It is called "realizing" a loss and it really sucks the next morning. Go party, standfast on stocks unless you need some losses for taxes
1187 2018-12-24 19:29:59 I want to know if Trump or any of the family members dumped stocks before all of the DOW losses while Trump created uncertainty. I also want to know if he or his family reinvests when it hits a low.

1188 2018-12-24 19:29:52 Oh ...and you actively trade individual stocks within your 401 ( k ) ? And which are the stable companies that weren’t stable in Jan 2017 ? Go....
1189 2018-12-24 19:29:49 If you were into crypto trading a little more (maybe penny stocks is a good proxy) you'd know it is never just the pump.
1190 2018-12-24 19:29:46 How are your stocks today?
1191 2018-12-24 19:29:11 @jimcramer do you think that if Warren Buffet comes out and says that he is buying stocks (if indeed he is), would the market turn geeen and starts going the opposite way?
1192 2018-12-24 19:29:06 Bring it on. I’m getting to that point of being over hearing about a collapse. Only a fool or those that have not a care in the world for fiduciary responsibility would still invested in stocks now. Popcorns ready.
1193 2018-12-24 19:29:04 Trump’s tweets are killing my stocks. Please stop!
1194 2018-12-24 19:28:55 Hopefully, you'll remove your head from where the sun doesn't shine and do something about the lunatic in the White House asylum instead of trying to distract from Trump's chaos with this kind of nonsense. How are your stocks doing today, or did you already short them, Lindsey?
1195 2018-12-24 19:28:39 I feel sorry for all the people retiring in the next 2 years. If they invested in stocks, much of their gains from the last 8 year bull run are going to be wiped outttt .
1196 2018-12-24 19:28:29 Perversely, firing Powell might be positive for stocks in the short term on the understanding that the next Chair would cut rates and end the balance sheet reduction policies. That, and the dollar would likely tank.
1197 2018-12-24 19:28:14 Yikes....I don't have any savings or stocks (I don't have money) but seeing the market die makes me worried about my folks and grandparents
1198 2018-12-24 19:27:44 i feel like ur whole life is so much ab stocks that they end up in your dreams too
1199 2018-12-24 19:27:17 Anyone about to cash out shouldn't be heavily weighted in stocks but yeah
1200 2018-12-24 19:27:16 Getting ready to go shopping for stocks this boxing day - best deals in town for tech stocks #AAPL #AMZN #GOOG #MSFT #ADBE
1201 2018-12-24 19:26:59 Stocks are on pace for their worst December since the Great Depression. On Friday, the Dow ended its worst week since 2008. You're not going to be around long!
1202 2018-12-24 19:26:24 Unless, they are deliberately manipulating the markets. Most companies that benefitted bigly from the tax cuts, decided to buy their stocks back. Stocks look really good right now if you are a buyer. Just sayin'...
1203 2018-12-24 19:26:22 Stocks were down about 3% today, a few more months like this and all of my investments will be gone.
1204 2018-12-24 19:26:10 What specific stocks do you have an eye on?
1205 2018-12-24 19:26:05 Anyone think maybe this is another gift  2 @realDonaldTrump 's buddies;  stocks low & its a buying spree to make the rich richer?
1206 2018-12-24 19:25:52 Since the Dems won the election stocks have plummeted. But you keep blaming Trump?
1207 2018-12-24 19:25:52 Seriously Jim, what do you advise typical investors who are in value (i.e. Benjamin Graham (Buffett pick) stocks) with a long term investing horizon?  Some of our stocks went up today believe it or not.
1208 2018-12-24 19:25:50 Stocks on sale for Christmas doesn’t happen often! Happy holidays everyone #christmas #holidays #ChristmasEve2018
1209 2018-12-24 19:25:35 Got greedy and gave my profits back red day #stocks
1210 2018-12-24 19:25:33 Does ppl with means include ppl at nonprofits making less than 50k? Govt employees? Almost everyone I know has a 401k. Not bc they love stocks bc they have jobs and want to retire. Crashes help wealthy. Who do you think bought all the houses during the last Bust?
1211 2018-12-24 19:25:23 Yeah he may have bought 1% in some stocks to technically be truthful, but he unloaded 10% overall...classic
1212 2018-12-24 19:25:22 Meanwhile in the US...stocks at the lowest for the month of December since the Great Depression. #WorstPresidentEver #TeumpResign #TrumpChristmasShutdown2018
1213 2018-12-24 19:25:08 The stock symbol is FB, but CL A stands for Class A stocks which are publicly traded. Yes it’s still connected to the CIA I’m sure, but your abbreviation was not correct .
1214 2018-12-24 19:25:03 I need to look at mine, but it hasn’t changed much the last few weeks. My stocks have dropped a little. Come on Apple! Lol.
1215 2018-12-24 19:25:03 Why isn't anyone saying that stocks are down due to a combination of profit taking for do low taxes, government instability, and the end of profit repatriation?
1216 2018-12-24 19:24:53 Hey @realDonaldTrump, U.S. stocks plunged on Monday in their worst day of Christmas Eve trading ever! Thought you should know.
1217 2018-12-24 19:24:40 You do know the fed raised rates and he told them not to? Do you know how stocks work? Seems like you don't. Also, you and other Democrats are for an unsecured America.  Makes no sense to complain when your side is to blame for not helping fix the problem.  #ShumerShutdown
1218 2018-12-24 19:24:39 From 2900 to ~25900. That’s about a 4000pt loss. After February, the Stock Market has been from bear to rhino. Around this week would market the 1 year anniversary since the tax cuts for the rich... For today, stocks plummeted about 700pts, which is considered to be the worst
1219 2018-12-24 19:24:26 Ideally, no one should have guns. Government should have a buy back. Otherwise, a compulsory mental bill of health before any gun purchases. No automatic weapons, no bump stocks, no semi automatic weapons allowed.
1220 2018-12-24 19:24:22 I still like tech stocks. Check out $NIO . They’re an electric vehicle company in Asia expanding in other countries over the next 3-5 years. Super cheap right now
1221 2018-12-24 19:24:21 Hint: his base owns 0 stocks.
1222 2018-12-24 19:24:10 Recession diversification
Setcoin analyst experts expect beginning bear trend at stocks U.S. and Global markets. S&P500 was drop down in -18% from all time high in couple of month after 10 years bull run; Apple -36%; Amazon -32%; Google -23% in couple of month.
1223 2018-12-24 19:24:10 the thing about Stocks is that you want them to be high and not low
1224 2018-12-24 19:23:22 Some of us are happy it’s tanking.  I can buy stocks I love at a cheaper price.
1225 2018-12-24 19:22:50 Why are Chinese stocks green?
1226 2018-12-24 19:22:47 "Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful”

I think this quote is going to be applicable in 2019 for stocks and crypto.
1227 2018-12-24 19:22:45 It's unlikely that a huge proportion of Trumps base hold stocks or shares .....the financial markets have no impact on their blindness to this fraud in the Oval office.

1229 2018-12-24 19:22:33 Everybody got hammered on their stocks and 401(k) so they need cash.
1230 2018-12-24 19:22:16 Not so much hedging...as understanding that markets go up & down...this is a bit of balance after big gains in stocks last year
1231 2018-12-24 19:21:58 Acquaintance I met at a real estate seminar hoped shit went South cuz ppl would be weeded out. 

"Let's the real dealmakers like us operate better" he said. 

Skepticism and being risk adverse are what bonds and CDs are for. Everyone wants to dabble in stocks but not.
1232 2018-12-24 19:21:50 topping patterns in mining stocks being invalidated-if $1280 breaks in gold the mining sector will roar
dont know about jnug or nugt because they be manipulated down via iv
1233 2018-12-24 19:21:02 I want to know if Trump of any of the family members dumped stocks before all of the DOW losses after Trump created uncertainty. I also want to know if he or his family reinvests when hit hits a low.
1234 2018-12-24 19:20:27 What did Mnuchin tell the "Plunge Protection Team"? To sell stocks?
1235 2018-12-24 19:20:21 From not the Village,but the USA POTUS IDIOT on Christmas Eve day screaming to Americans>Screw your Stocks(engine of Capitalism)>Screw your 401K retirement account ! Can the Nation singing everywhere, at every Sporting games”Land of the Braves” Show up,demand Trump to Resign?
1236 2018-12-24 19:20:21 I think Trump did this on purpose, knowing he’d take away the will of the legislature to consider changing the law if he said he’d handle it. Knowing full well if he did it would be blocked, ultimately saving both bump stocks and gun rights.
1237 2018-12-24 19:20:08 I would not invest at this point. We are still unwinding from @realDonaldTrump 's phony stock gains. There was nothing to justify the run up in stocks under him just the opposite. All of his actions should have depressed stocks.
1238 2018-12-24 19:19:58 @SEC_Enforcement  Has anyone checked to see if any person in the current administration is shorting stocks?
1239 2018-12-24 19:19:45 Alternate headline: Stocks fall because of Sen Schumer’s refusal to protect Americans.
1240 2018-12-24 19:19:45 Economy surges. Stocks go down. Not rocket science. If you want a new voting block for your crazy agenda, do it another way than using illegal immigration.
1241 2018-12-24 19:19:41 How many people can buy stocks right now? In Trump base?
1242 2018-12-24 19:19:40 What's wrong chuckie? UR  $$$$ making war hawk is gone & UR stocks go down? "what did Mattis say this time?" Ask kildrebeast & muller who delivered the  Uranium 1 sample to Russia. I bet Russia knows because they seam to be guilty of everything the DemonRat Party SES has done !!!
1243 2018-12-24 19:19:38 3% dive in stocks! Thanks #TrumpShutDown #FB
1244 2018-12-24 19:19:14 Coppin cases of activist to give sprite stocks a boost
1245 2018-12-24 19:19:10 @realDonaldTrump Let the stocks fall then declare a state of emergency and totally restructure our money supply.  END THE FED. No I don't care how bad the economy gets.  I don't care if I have to eat from a soup line.  Get it done. Merry Xmas!
1246 2018-12-24 19:19:06 Ross, you’re over your head with KM, he #timestamped the sell on stocks on Sept 30th.  He’s been long $TLT and $XLU since.  Not the FANG’s like you.
1247 2018-12-24 19:18:54 I never retweet. 
The funniest thing Dems are doing is selling off their stocks and cashing out losing 4000 points over the last few weeks hurting selves. Yeah. To convince us PresTrump doesn’t know finances. But I know it’s dems becuz they’re buying bitcoin and pot stocks!!
1248 2018-12-24 19:18:52 I’m glad the stock market is tanking your stocks that you bought through insider trading.
1249 2018-12-24 19:18:47 And pot stocks let's not forget pot stocks
1250 2018-12-24 19:18:43 Well the stock market took a dump again. I told ya 2 years ago to take you're money out of high end stocks & hide most of your money. If you're on the fringe of bankruptcy, well, I feel for ya
1251 2018-12-24 19:18:19 I have a brokage firm and I know I still have some stocks but I don’t call or visit them to know how far neither am I receiving any dividends from those companies. Please what should I do?
1252 2018-12-24 19:18:15 Ha, ha, you're kidding, right? You, your corrupt family and your dumpster fire of an administration are laughing stocks among intelligent people worldwide.
1253 2018-12-24 19:18:08 So, if Trump bloated the deficit to give rich people more money and they used it to buy back stocks, that money is pretty much pissed away now, isn't it? Am I missing something?
1254 2018-12-24 19:18:06 Stocks continue to fall! Free fall? Investors to Fed Gov: Steve Mnuchin, who? Who is Mnuchin? Who the hell is he?
1255 2018-12-24 19:17:53 You caused the trade wars with all other countries with your steel tariffs and a trade war with China.  Not the Federal Reserve Chairman...YOU.  Stocks were tanking well before the interest rate hikes.  #TrumpResign
1256 2018-12-24 19:17:50 I would like an immediate investigation by the SEC to see exactly who profited by shorting  stocks.
1257 2018-12-24 19:17:50 “October. This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks. The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August, and February.”  - Mark Twain
1258 2018-12-24 19:17:44 This is exactly why they chose bump stocks. I feel the same way, a bump stock is a novelty at best but banning them is Setting a precedent and chipping away at the Second Amendment. We are already limited to 10 round mags where I live. AR’s and AK’s are illegal. What’s next?
1259 2018-12-24 19:17:34 Stocks have worst Christmas eve in history of the market!! #horrible
1260 2018-12-24 19:17:31 Can I take my stocks back?
1261 2018-12-24 19:17:30 A lot of people are selling off their stocks due to the market crash. I believe that in a few days, we will see an influx of capital come into the #Crypto space (Of course, in about 2/3 business days )

Own your currency!

#crypto #crypto #blockchain
1262 2018-12-24 19:17:20 How self-absorbed can you be? This is of your making. What about the people working without pay because of you? What about those of us losing money on stocks because of you? So, please don't whine to us, regular folk about how lonely you are.
1263 2018-12-24 19:17:04 It Is! If President Trump didn't ban bump stocks people would not be able to aim properly which could lower the number of people shot.
1264 2018-12-24 19:17:04 March 2016 was the “Dimon Bottom”: stocks were sliding since December 2015 rate hike (the first one since QE), and in March 2016 Jamie Dimon bought $JPM stock himself and that marked the bottom (until June 2016 Brexit selloff)
1265 2018-12-24 19:16:48 That's the daily volume, I think. Worldwide stocks are down trillions already.
1266 2018-12-24 19:16:47 1. Is the fed supposed to keep interest rates at near 0 forever?
2. Why would the fed be interested in "tanking" the economy?
3. Stocks were underperforming before the election
1267 2018-12-24 19:16:44 Well, since that giant tax cut was used to buy back stocks, that's just money pissed away now.
1268 2018-12-24 19:16:36 It’s astounding to me how many people hear stocks and think of monocled old men in top hats smoking cigars and drinking brandy. No dummies it’s your neighbors and your friends with 401’s. I know so many people who lost half their 401’s in 2008 and took years to get back.
1269 2018-12-24 19:16:36 @realDonaldTrump Stocks fell yet AGAIN today; gov’t shut down; all of our allies dislike us; and people in your Admin continue to quit in DISGUST. Sure am tired of all this $&&/$@ winning :-( Would be great if you would do the right thing for once and RESIGN inmediately.
1270 2018-12-24 19:16:28 @StephenMoore you are a total idiot. You like the stocks right now?? I think I see investors jumping out the windows behind you while you’re on CNN. You need to tell people you don’t sell when stocks are low? What is this, stock market 101? Go drown in eggnog
1271 2018-12-24 19:16:27 @realDonaldTrump You set a record today, the biggest drop in stocks ever on X-mas eve...
1272 2018-12-24 19:16:22 Market crashing...im just gonna watch these prices keep falling and buy everything. Pick up mad OT. Bout time I grabbed up some of the stocks I couldn’t get before
1273 2018-12-24 19:16:21 I think most value investors love these kind of markets. Being able to pick up stocks that get caught up in the sell-off at bargain prices. 'Throwing the baby out with the bathwater.' I usually have a pit in my stomach buying stocks when the market is on a tear.
1274 2018-12-24 19:16:17 @BigPlayReceiver @realLoganLevy Thompson would be great...I’m not as familiar with guys stocks at this point, are Metcalf and Harry viewed as strong top 20 guys or is it a chance they get in BAL’s range?
1275 2018-12-24 19:16:12 "Stocks have Worst Christmas Eve in History"
@FoxNews 
..and you vile bastards are responsible for this Fuc$ing nightmare.
#assholes
#ShutdownStories
1276 2018-12-24 19:16:05 On the bright side there’s a HUGE sale on stocks going on now.
1277 2018-12-24 19:16:02 “Strategists say the president too has become a source of volatility, and his once positive impact on stocks has now become mostly a negative.”
1278 2018-12-24 19:15:58 Do you still own stocks?
Thank the DONALD.
1279 2018-12-24 19:15:57 Trump supporters! Did you know when Mnuchin called banks & made statement followed byTRUMP tweeting against the Fed...it accelerated the sell off...sending the stocks to THE LOWEST CHRISTMAS EVE MARKET EVER?
1280 2018-12-24 19:15:44 Market Close: MBS +9bps; DOW -653.17; NASDAQ -140.07; S&P 500 -65.52; 10yr Treasury 2.74%; Stocks plunge to it's worst Christmas Eve trading ever!  Yields slide, as well!  Mortgage Rates improve!
1281 2018-12-24 19:15:44 I do not think Washington has fully grasped the extent to which millennials do not own stocks.
1282 2018-12-24 19:15:37 The Fed is trying to keep us from a recession - the last one caused so many of us great losses - getting ready to retire I am not allowing it to happen again - Just know the American people that don't wear read hats are not stupid - we have stocks and bonds - do they?
1283 2018-12-24 19:15:23 Stocks are wildly overvalued and corrections are to be expected.  That said, it's very likely that the correction will leave them undervalued.  Personally, I like sure things.  When the left gains power, I do targeting shorts, because the left destroys wealth.  Done very well:)
1284 2018-12-24 19:15:10 It's Christmas eve and Donald Trump has plunged this country into absolutely mayhem in the past week the stocks have plummeted, he shut down the government, two government officials have resigned in protest, Troops pulled out of  , and more indictments are yet to come.
1285 2018-12-24 19:15:09 me:  *hasnt eaten red meat since i was 16, still has to remind my parents of this on a regular basis*
my dad: *stocks the fridge for christmas with literally every type of red meat possible and not much else*
1286 2018-12-24 19:15:02 December is usually a healthy month for stocks, but this month has been the worst since 1931.
1287 2018-12-24 19:15:01 Trump shill @stephenmoore likes the stock market now because stocks are cheap. So much #winning.
1288 2018-12-24 19:14:57 You really think that's it? Sure it's not some fiat/mortgage/stocks/bonds bubble about to burst?
1289 2018-12-24 19:14:48 A “bear market” is when stocks see a 20 percent decline or more from a recent high — but they’re also marked by overall pessimism on Wall Street.
1290 2018-12-24 19:14:46 Stocks down ~20%. Inverted yield curve. Big businesses laying off more people than they‘re hiring. The GOP shut down the US government for no good reason. The man in the WH is under investigation, paid by foreign governments, may be compromised, and is tanking US foreign policy.
1291 2018-12-24 19:14:28 Maybe you should check the chart again, there were the tax cuts. Reps were hoping the mythological trickle down economics... Take a look at February 2018. Between the span of December and February, the Reps were bragging that the economy was doing great. Until stocks dropped
1292 2018-12-24 19:14:22 U.S. STOCKS ON THE MOVE-Oil stocks, bank stocks, Mindbody The Morning News Call newsletter: The Day Ahead newsletter: U.S. stocks fell for the fourth straight session on Monday, as political deadlock in Washington continued and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuc...http://bit…
1293 2018-12-24 19:14:15 No mention about how stocks are in freefall? You sure as hell take credit when it's up.
1294 2018-12-24 19:14:10 No nk drama, Isis mostly destroyed, nafta renegotiate.  Jobs a plenty.  Stocks not doing so great bother than that what are u worried about?  The unreasonable dems shutting down part of the gov over 5 billion for border security?
1295 2018-12-24 19:14:03 Pshhh... who even owns stocks?
1296 2018-12-24 19:14:02 That was hope and 1% tax cuts. Those guys have bought back stocks, moved companies out of USA and hidden moola off shore by now.
1297 2018-12-24 19:14:01 ? will the govt/plung protection team suppress the iv of jnug and nugt when gold breaks out as Cramer and especially Kudlow aka Mothers Milk loooooove the $ and stocks.
1298 2018-12-24 19:13:59 Mick Mulvaney needs to be subpoenaed to see if he shorted a bunch a bank stocks after his utterly stupid statement saying the banks have enough liquidity
1299 2018-12-24 19:13:57 Surely these people who show up at Trump's rallies going to start buying stocks to make him look good.
1300 2018-12-24 19:13:56 Great time to go bargain hunting for Dividend Stocks! #BuyLow #BuyAndHold
1301 2018-12-24 19:13:41 It’s like,  he’s trying to make anyone and everyone he can to pay for a construct that has been proven to die on arrival. The only people who benefit from the wall are his friends in the construction business and his family who likely have investments or stocks in the enterprise
1302 2018-12-24 19:13:39 Pretty cool that Trump is bringing the price of stocks down, so that everyone can afford some.
1303 2018-12-24 19:13:37 EMs recently been doing better than US stocks.
1304 2018-12-24 19:13:36 Shorting stocks, inflation index funds, etc can turn a nice profit.  Money can be made in any market.
1305 2018-12-24 19:13:32 Most millennials and gen xers will benefit from the market crash as our 401k contributions buy cheaper and cheaper stocks. Feel sorry for the near retirees who put their trust in someone they didn't understand.
1306 2018-12-24 19:13:14 I’m waiting for stocks to go down more. I don’t think we’ve seen the end of this correction.  When that happens - buy!
1307 2018-12-24 19:13:06 Holy shit... my Walmart stocks have dropped 22 dollars in a month. Thank you fat dotard illegitimate @realDonaldTrump
1308 2018-12-24 19:12:46 Brit, you and your employer have done enough damage to the country. Please enjoy your egg nog, throw in double the shots, don’t check your stocks, and stay off Twitter (psst, tell Donald that too)
1309 2018-12-24 19:12:35 Why y’all breaking everything?  #stocks
1310 2018-12-24 19:12:30 And pensions are also heavily invested in stocks
1311 2018-12-24 19:12:29 @MSNBC @CNN @abcnews @CBSNews @NBCNews @FoxNews @nytimes Dem indoctrinated electorate don’t have any stocks.  They would be a lot better today if they had them &  didn’t stupidly give the Dems back the House! Never prosperity w/Dems. They stifle economies. Ignorant electorate!
1312 2018-12-24 19:12:27 I wonder if Trump is saying fuck the rich bankers and all the 1% it’s not his base, and now he’s gone full napalm. Look at bank stocks. My fear is that he hates the bankers and 1% and media he lets a full melt down occur. #nobackstop
1313 2018-12-24 19:12:17 Dollar weakens on government shutdown concerns, plunging stocks
1314 2018-12-24 19:12:16 Jan 2019. Stocks down.Savings accounts up and once Bakkt is approved by the SEC. Crypto up.
1315 2018-12-24 19:12:15 2/ As stocks fall, options/restricted stock won't get exercised; houses won't get bought/built, new pools won't get put in; cars won't get bought...Greenspan knew this.
1316 2018-12-24 19:11:54 Stocks are on sale. Everyone should think about buying. I’ve been keeping some powder dry in anticipation of a correction.
1317 2018-12-24 19:11:51 INCREDIBLE DAY TO BE TOO POOR TO OWN STOCKS
1318 2018-12-24 19:11:37 meals are more fun to research than stocks
1319 2018-12-24 19:11:31 that's good for bitcoin

fuck stocks 

buy crypto
1320 2018-12-24 19:11:26 Someone should subpoena Mick Mulvaney’s bank stocks after his statement the other day to see if he shorted a bunch of bank stocks @SenFeinstein #ShutdownStories #TrumpResign

1324 2018-12-24 19:10:42 People who short stocks are very fine people too!
1325 2018-12-24 19:10:39 Why did you sell all your stocks? I know the market has been going downhill but you know when you’re in it the experts or some say never to panic and don’t do anything. Let it all ride out.

1326 2018-12-24 19:10:36 Lies, everyone knows his word doesn’t mean shit. Just like he would sign the stop gap bill and keep the government open. You sir are perpetuating his lies to save your own skin. You are a disgrace to this country just as trump is. Stocks are down 600+ point today because of lies
1327 2018-12-24 19:10:09 Not all of these are listed on Nasdaq. I’d point out which stocks but you don’t strike me as the type of person that cares about accuracy.
1328 2018-12-24 19:10:03 Rich people aren’t in a hurry to sell stocks. They can wait it out. Or use money that isn’t in stock market to buy cheap stock.
1329 2018-12-24 19:10:01 Stocks are on sale! It’s a good time to buy.
1330 2018-12-24 19:09:41 Long bitcoin, short stocks and banksters
1331 2018-12-24 19:09:36 During the festival season, there is the looming threat of yakisoba sets reaching low stocks.
1332 2018-12-24 19:09:35 Nothing made up just the truth which you cannot abide in nothing but the truth so help us understand what the hell are you tweeting about your shutdown you government your reputation your wall your fault your fault your fault  stocks are down down your fault don the con
1333 2018-12-24 19:09:32 lets thank him making stocks drop-lets thank him for TRUMP SHUTDOWN-Lets thank him for jailing mothers & children in cages-Lets thank him for SELLING OUT country & Constitution let's thank him for destroying our Great country making it a shithole Stop kissing his ass @danabashcnn
1334 2018-12-24 19:09:20 I wonder if Mnuchin shorted some stocks.
1335 2018-12-24 19:09:16 TR: So ... recession.

Bystander A: I sold all my stock this morning.
TR: !!! [ouch]

Bystander B: Oh. I don't think that will affect me, I don't have any investments like stocks. Maybe prices will go up.
TR: !?! [hmm]
1336 2018-12-24 19:09:16 Merry Christmas, don’t look at your stocks !
1337 2018-12-24 19:09:07 If you know anything about the stock market you'd be buying stocks right now but you obviously don't. 
1338 2018-12-24 19:09:03 Lol except for the fact that 99% of mass shooters don't use bump stocks and 98% of mass shooters don't even use AR15's
1339 2018-12-24 19:09:01 Nice @jack. Glad you have time for coffee pics. Now you planning to do anything to defend your stocks ??? $TWTR $SQ
1340 2018-12-24 19:08:51 @WhiteHouse @RealDonaldTrump @POTUS @Senate @Congress The Dow Stock Market Closing Dow Closed Down 653 Today! Is Worst Week In 10 Years! In Line For Worst December Since The Great Depression! Stocks Made No Money For The Year!
1341 2018-12-24 19:08:36 The only problem our economy has is the Fed. They don’t have a feel for the Market. Trump. Why isn’t he touting the fact the rising rates are a good sign? And why is the stock market a disaster? Worst Christmas Eve by 450 percent in US history. Mnuchin said tax cut stocks go up.
1342 2018-12-24 19:08:30 I am tired of hearing that Trump is responsible for all the ills, stocks falling, immigration, etc, etc.  I think it is about time to put the responsibility where it belongs.  Dems,CNN, and other news that only wants something if Trump doesn't.  Wake up, he is our President.
1343 2018-12-24 19:08:24 2018 was a good year for investing. As long as you didnt own any bitcoin, altcoins, gold, silver, amaya shares, tech stocks, domestic stocks, international stocks, or any commodities or securities.

Basically the keep all your money in cash under your mattress strategy did great.
1344 2018-12-24 19:08:20 naw but its time to start buying stocks
1345 2018-12-24 19:08:11 The inner circle has probably been selling off stocks since October when the dive began.
1346 2018-12-24 19:08:10 True days b4 the crash Paulson n bernankie were meeting the men behind the curtain, Congress men selling their stocks while in the press they were saying things are great
1347 2018-12-24 19:07:56 Why did you ridicule it? Stocks are fine but Bitcoin is a game changer on many levels.
1348 2018-12-24 19:07:53 Oh no James. Not stocks.  
Merry Christmas! 
1349 2018-12-24 19:07:50 His joke was less about festivus and more about the Elizabeth Warren’s Native American claims since the stocks resemble a teepee.
1350 2018-12-24 19:07:44 holy shit. Are you guys seeing this crazy sale on stocks? THEY'RE SLASHING PRICES!
1351 2018-12-24 19:07:32 I went to see mein Grossvater yesterday. He said not to worry as I was about 50% in CDs, 25% dividend stocks, and the rest in layered bonds (?). He wants me to take a few online courses from Wharton and then plan on going to PA for a year. I'm so happy that I get to run my own
1352 2018-12-24 19:07:26 Retained earnings that are really deferred compensation dont help cap rates on stocks. Trickle down giveaways in hopes of reinvestment has been proven a fallacy. An artificially inflated market will correct once the real analysis determines the gaslight. My tweets warning u lost?
1353 2018-12-24 19:07:15 At this point, there's no reason for investors to buy the dips. That makes technical analysis useless. Stocks will continue to confound the "experts" as money searches for any safe haven.
1354 2018-12-24 19:07:12 A steep sell-off in *US stocks* worsened in a pre-holiday shortened session on Monday, as a move by the US Treasury secretary to convene a crisis group and other political developments rattled investors and pushed the S&P 500 to the brink of a bear market.

*The Dow Jones In…
1355 2018-12-24 19:07:01 Economics, doesn't work that way...President Trump does get credit for increased pensions, 401k's and 529 plans. But sorry stocks don't fluctuate by the same rules. Strictly Federal Reserve.
1356 2018-12-24 19:06:59 Stocks falling, #TrumpShutdown, #Trump forcing #Mattis out early. Merry Christmas everyone. #Trump has it all under control. 
1357 2018-12-24 19:06:49 Yes. Although rate of growth even while it continued to rise was slowing.  Legitimate economists pointed that out. Rubes, who rarely own stocks, believed in the miracle man baby was lying about.
1358 2018-12-24 19:06:29 U.S. Stocks, Obama vs. @realDonaldTrump 
Obama (Inaugural 2009 to Dec. 24, 2010): +47.7%
Trump (Inaugural 2017 to Dec. 24, 2018):  +3.9%
(S&P 500 data, not including dividends)
1359 2018-12-24 19:06:02 Isn’t what he did something close to insider trading? I don’t know all that much about stocks,  but it would seem to me that he made those calls to hint to investors to sell their stock.
1360 2018-12-24 19:05:55 They can’t sell their stocks if the want?
1361 2018-12-24 19:05:48 See, it’s perfectly reasonable that Trump’s chaos du jour is a likely explanation for the current bear market. But if you really believe that, then you also have to credit him for the long run-up in stocks before this latest crash. Otherwise, it’s just motivated reasoning.
1362 2018-12-24 19:05:47 Some stocks that I follow closely and haven't given even a bit of a chance to double down despite market correcting into the 'official bear territory' - $DG $HDB $ORLY $DLTR (and several others). Call me when these correct more, will be  ready waiting backed up with my truck
1363 2018-12-24 19:05:39 I'm sure we'll hear Professor Buffett soon, just like a familiar old song, come on CNBC and tell everyone to buy stocks.
1364 2018-12-24 19:05:33 I want to know if he shorted any stocks before announcing his phone calls on Twitter.
1365 2018-12-24 19:05:30 The manipulation of our economy by the Federal Reserve and bailed out lobal banksters is what is causing the fluctuations. Overvalued stocks also plays a part. Wait until they bring back gold petropayments. Hahahaha
1366 2018-12-24 19:05:20 Not to mention stocks go up and down all the time.
1367 2018-12-24 19:05:04 STOCK MARKET HAS TANKED IN A MAJOR WAY.  DIDN'T YOU SAY STOCKS TANKING AND SHUTDOWNS ARE SIGNS OF A BAD LEADER, YUP, THAT WAS YOU.  JUST LIKE THOSE THAT TAKE THE 5TH ARE REALLY CRIMINALS....LIKE STONE.
1368 2018-12-24 19:04:57 You gave him no credit when the stocks were soaring but now you can’t wait to jump. How credible do you think you are? Not very. Since trumps was the last offer, it is now in Schumer’s lap. He refuses to counter. So it is his shutdown now. Counter chuck.
1369 2018-12-24 19:04:54 The stocks have tanked after the midterms.  8/31 closed at 26,124.57. 
11/7 closed at 25,635.01. Today 12/24 21,792.20.  Since midterms and future Democrat control of the house, the market has dropped 3842.81.
1370 2018-12-24 19:04:44 An investment which the "average investor" trusts more than, say... stocks. Something with perceived manifest physical worth, like gold or land or a building - as opposed to... bitcoin or credit default swaps. Yes?
1371 2018-12-24 19:04:31 Nope, I just know the true definition of respect and not the alternative fact definition Trump wants you to believe. What has transpired to make you believe we are respected? We are laughed at, the dollar is falling even more, stocks diving, no longer world thought leaders so...?
1372 2018-12-24 19:04:25 My question is what is really going on? Is someone/group pulling strings to make a BIG killing while stocks are down? Something just doesn't feel/smell  right to this 80+ yr old.Please tell me I'm wrong. It's terrible not trusting your government but considering who is in charge
1373 2018-12-24 19:04:04 I bought some pot stocks when DT elected
1374 2018-12-24 19:03:52 Justin, Does the avoid resource stocks for now theory include gold?
1375 2018-12-24 19:03:44 It seems like a good time to be buying stocks at bargain prices.
1376 2018-12-24 19:03:43 Smart move. People usually freeze up in panic when markets drop, but it’s the right time to be scooping up bargain stocks of good companies.
1377 2018-12-24 19:03:43 OH, I get it now! The president has put stocks on sale for the holidays! #deepdiscounts #whiletheylast
1378 2018-12-24 19:03:12 When the stocks are at a record high its praise trump..when  they are the worst they have ever been it's those damn fed and Democrats you sir are a child
1379 2018-12-24 19:02:48 Stocks are like casinos anyway. What is happening now is part of the risks. It shall be well.
1380 2018-12-24 19:02:40 Stocks tumble as fear of dems gearing up to take the house...
1381 2018-12-24 19:02:15 Ok seriously, enough with the "winning" already..., #winning #dowjones #stocks #TrumpResign
1382 2018-12-24 19:02:12 I couldn't agree more.  If he has any investment accounts, or stocks, he just lost a bundle!  Funny, I can't stop laughing about that part of the story!
1383 2018-12-24 19:01:55 Not a factor for the 99% - as big daily downsizings have gone on through the past month, weren't caused by the stock market.
And about half the past five years college grads aren't underemployed due to stocks now.
1384 2018-12-24 19:01:52 We’ll know we are in trouble when @realDonaldTrump ‘s cabinet and the repugnuts start selling off their stocks!!!
1385 2018-12-24 19:01:36 Wonder what stocks they wanted to buy?
1386 2018-12-24 19:01:27 It’s Merry Crash-Mess  #stocks
1387 2018-12-24 19:01:19 Maybe it’s because stocks are up 80+pct of years and research analysts just don’t want to risk being wrong... and timing equities is nearly impossible (and if you could, you wouldn’t be a research analyst)
1388 2018-12-24 19:01:17 The only thing more stupid than a bump stock is a ban on bump stocks.
1389 2018-12-24 19:01:15 Worst Christmas Eve in history for the Dow and worst December since The Great Depression of the 1930's.

So why not do some last-minute shopping for stocks at bargin prices to put in your own Christmas stocking?

Some people cry, some people go into the Kleenex business...
1390 2018-12-24 19:01:10 RW: Stocks Extend Fall Despite Mnuchin Bid to Reassure Investors
1391 2018-12-24 19:01:08 Gotta love being up +7.5% on the year in this market  #investing #share2steem #money #stocks $SPX $IWM $QQQ
1392 2018-12-24 19:01:07 We like to buy stocks which we feel are undervalued and then we have to have the guts to buy more when they go down. -- Walter Schloss
1393 2018-12-24 19:01:06 Good luck. One of the most volatile stocks on the market. I don't have the stomach for it.
1394 2018-12-24 19:00:54 I'm sorry, but this is a very bad take. It's not only the well off that depends on stocks and 401Ks.
1395 2018-12-24 19:00:50 YUP! Thanks @cdninvestor2000 ain't that the truth. Throw in high fees as well. No 1 and no 2. The need will become greater as defined benefit pensions continue on the path to extinction. Stocks within our risk tolerance level.
1396 2018-12-24 19:00:40 Also.... didn’t realize my new company’s 401k was tired up in stocks until a few days ago... yeaaaa I’ve lost $2k so far and waited on hold for a financial advisory or half hour @Fidelity trying to get help to change it. I know it’s Christmas but I’m so sad! #StockMarket
1397 2018-12-24 19:00:17 NATE SILVER: Easy answer... War based economy driven by stocks in the big corp & companies that make BILLIONS from lucrative GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS!!! Military contracts are a huge waste of Govt money!  They are not held accountable! Yes, DOW will go back up. Eventually.
1398 2018-12-24 19:00:15 Stock buybacks by a company isn't stability. Its false inflation of there stocks
1399 2018-12-24 19:00:12 POLL: Why would Steve Munchin try to calm liquidity fears that no-one was discussing, CREATING PANIC and a further sell-off in the stock market?

What's the MOST PROBABLE answer? 

#StevenMnuchin #StockMarket #Liquidity #Stocks #Mnuchin #FederalReserve #Treasury #MerryChristmas
1400 2018-12-24 19:00:05 Which Trump and Mnuchin cronies shorted stocks ahead of this appalling announcement?
1401 2018-12-24 19:00:03 Stocks cyberfall after Steve Mnuchin makes call to cyberbanks
1402 2018-12-24 18:59:57 Glad I played it safe on stocks this year otherwise I might be in shambles with the year ending for the stock market.
1403 2018-12-24 18:59:44 Stocks are based on future and stability of a country.
1404 2018-12-24 18:59:40 I have noticed that people on Twitter are blaming President Trump for stock market going down. Let's see what is differant than a few months ago.  Democrats own house, FED raising rates after 10 years helping Obama, Dems only want impeachment.& complainers do not even have STOCKS
1405 2018-12-24 18:59:39 Am I only one wondering which administration officials have been shorting stocks this week?
1406 2018-12-24 18:59:39 Thanks for the laugh!!  Stocks are down 20%, #MAGA
1407 2018-12-24 18:59:09 Everyone seems to be trying to get rid of their stocks before Christmas.
1408 2018-12-24 18:59:01 my niece calls stocks pound cake ‘the special bread from philly’ 
1409 2018-12-24 18:58:50 My weed stocks took a fucking dive smh
1410 2018-12-24 18:58:46 Stocks at the 52 week low. Omg. Presidential fail.
1411 2018-12-24 18:58:46 My elderly father’s retirement is in stocks, and over the past few months he’s lost about 20% of his retirement account. Because of trade wars and instability brought on by this president.
1412 2018-12-24 18:58:42 When you bid the market up at 15-20% a year.
And the economy grows at 2-3% a year.
Even Jim Cramer can't sell stocks with a straight face.
The market was simply way overpriced by hypoxic buyers who believed their own wishful thinking.
1413 2018-12-24 18:58:32 Stocks plummet as Dow Jones heads for worst month in a decade. Thanks to tRump.
1414 2018-12-24 18:58:06 Only FOOL's buy stocks at it Hight, same with Gold & Silver. The owners who bought low need FOOL'S to buy when the above are Peaking High. Fool's make the Rich, Wealthier. Yes, I would buy Gold less than $300.00 per ounce or NOT, if it never gets that low.
1415 2018-12-24 18:57:59 I tried palu for a while. Imo, she struggles at taking stocks against people who di correctly and landing safely can be a problem since landing nair isn't safe on shield. Overall, she racks up damage well and recovers well, she just struggles to take stocks outside of hard reads.
1416 2018-12-24 18:57:26 What do you say about pot stocks?
1417 2018-12-24 18:56:35 a bad take considering plenty of working class people invest in stocks for retirement money while rich people's wealth will actually remain pretty cushioned here
1418 2018-12-24 18:56:32 I think shareholders believed #taxscam was worth it, but also believe they figure there's not much upside now, what with the #tradewar hurting markets and Trump's rashness making investing riskier than ever.

Good thing for Trump: his base won't be hurt bc many don't own stocks.
1419 2018-12-24 18:56:21 Stocks are down 20%+ but the economy is healthy. Employment is at lows, spending is up, earnings up even if they stay flat or fall 5% next year valuations are so juicy.

I think this is the once in a decade buying opportunity people talk about. #buythedip #nomoneylefttobuy $SPY
1420 2018-12-24 18:56:16 Some sobering thoughts: arguably the #1929Crash and the #1987Crash are the ones we should study. Why? Because they we not linked necessarily to the banking/credit sector of even leverage in stocks. There were no harbingers here except a clear loss of confidence in #TrumpONomics,
1421 2018-12-24 18:56:11 So the DOW keeps dropping......I should buy some stocks now, no?
1422 2018-12-24 18:56:10 True, unless you’re retiring soon, and foolishly left the bulk of your 401(k) invested in stocks. I’m amazed at how many times I’ve known of soon-to-be retirees who have done this.
1423 2018-12-24 18:56:07 How much of Main Street do you think is invested in the stock market? And if you’re at or close to retirement, what kind of a risk profile should you have? Everything in stocks?
1424 2018-12-24 18:56:04 Under construction at the moment. Probably something like:

Full List Striking

FD
BF
SVille
PS2
Kalos
T&C
Skyloft
Seige
Yoshi's
Other Yoshi's
Wario Ware

3 bans. No DSR.

3 stocks. 7 minutes.

1427 2018-12-24 18:55:55 Should invest in some coal or steel stocks, I hear all those jobs are coming back and they’ll be stronger than ever /s
1428 2018-12-24 18:55:55 CNN:  "Stocks are on pace for their worst December since the Great Depression."
1429 2018-12-24 18:55:52 An you said something how GREAT the Stocks are doing ?? I didn’t hear anything about that . So much winning. #TrumpRussia #TrumpCrash #TrumpShutdown2018 #StockMarket
1430 2018-12-24 18:55:48 Bet the cabinet members are buying their wallets full of stocks
1431 2018-12-24 18:55:30 Bitcoin has outperformed the S&P for last two years, even after the 80% drawdown.

Translation: you would have made more money in Bitcoin than stocks 
1432 2018-12-24 18:55:27 I bet all you guys hurting in stocks right now are regretting hating on $crypto as we go up. See you in 2019 when you come over to the dark side (maybe sooner)
1433 2018-12-24 18:55:21 WRONG. Economics 101. When the economy is doing well (stocks rose from 2009-2017) the Fed has to raise rates to prevent inflationary bubbles. The drop in the last 3 months is wholly due to #TarrifMan’s imbecilic policies and unhinged rants. #TrumpShutdown #TrumpMarketCrash
1434 2018-12-24 18:55:15 My red pill moment was watching banks get money for free and ppl paid 20pct on cards.  Banking system bail outs.  Next year my broker says buy buy bank stocks.  "Record profits"  wth?  Bankers take all the money off the table annually.  Shame
1435 2018-12-24 18:55:00 Stocks and bonds villains
1436 2018-12-24 18:54:34 EXHANGE stabilation fund is just tabu IMHO. In Reality Fed have own trading desks and nobody REALLY KNOWS how much and when they are propping up stocks and bonds.  Last months market plunges are macgically corrected, but this time, i think retailers are panic and fed is powerles
1437 2018-12-24 18:54:27 Fair point, I didn’t watch the video nor do I follow stocks. However their crypto coverage is woeful and is a running joke on the crypto community. Merry Xmas 
1438 2018-12-24 18:54:23 CNN:  "Stocks are on pace for their worst December since the Great Depression."
1439 2018-12-24 18:54:20 Well... sell a couple house and sell some stocks and use your savings and give them 40 million. What’s the problem burn?
1440 2018-12-24 18:54:19 You mean YOU don’t have a feel for the market. Thanks so much for this Christmas gift. My elderly father‘s retirement is in stocks and your lack of knowledge of how the market works has put his retirement in jeopardy.
1441 2018-12-24 18:54:11 i hate everyone that voted for trump. ruining my stocks.
1442 2018-12-24 18:54:11 Poors like me don't have stocks so it might take a while before the effects of this trickle down to me
1443 2018-12-24 18:54:08 If the banks are doing fine then of course it was a huge overreaction. He was just doing his job following up on banks after the gov shut down and stocks down 16%.
1444 2018-12-24 18:54:04 Wall Street, and stocks were on track for their worst year since 2008 and the largest December decline since the 1930s. The S&P 500 closed down 2.7 percent after a shortened trading session because of the Christmas holiday.   - NYT
1445 2018-12-24 18:53:47 80% of the stocks are owned by the top 1%.

A side effect of an imploding Nasdaq is weakening the political power of Silicon Valley.

Watch California itself have financial problems soon. That surplus is a mirage.
1446 2018-12-24 18:53:40 US stocks slid into a bear market on Monday.
1447 2018-12-24 18:53:39 Live by the stocks, die by the stocks
1448 2018-12-24 18:53:28 Thank God they gave you stacks of blank paper to sign. That should keep you from sending stocks off another cliff with another tweet blaming the Fed
1449 2018-12-24 18:53:28 Firesale on stocks!
1450 2018-12-24 18:53:10 Obama, 3/09: ...profit & earning ratios are [getting] to the point where buying stocks is a...good deal if you've got a long-term perspective...

Trump, now: ...only problem our economy has is the Fed...like a powerful golfer who can’t score b/c he has no touch - he can’t putt!
1451 2018-12-24 18:53:01 Well with many traders fine market does tend to see a lot of selling this time of year.  Also traders sell losing stocks for tax deductions and buy them back after the new year
1452 2018-12-24 18:52:41 Or...when trump is charge he will not take any blame for the bad..just the good.. yet he felt obama should be impeached for just that...the stocks nosediving... funny how the opinions change when the finger is pointed to the president
1453 2018-12-24 18:52:40 @SaraEisen can you cool down and stop being such a shill? Just report what’s happening and trying to calm market that accustomed to training wheels free fed money stocks should be bought and silt on merit
1454 2018-12-24 18:52:39 Agree. But when the stocks were rising, the @gop cried that the stock market was up due to “tax cuts”, but now they are not owning it when the stocks are down.
1455 2018-12-24 18:52:31 For anyone who has slightly been interested in stock investing. This a great time to educate yourself about stocks and jump into the market.
1456 2018-12-24 18:52:31 I think the point is that they're probably losing a lot more than the rest of us, since the top 10% own a disproportionate amount of stocks.  @SeanMcElwee
1457 2018-12-24 18:52:30 They want to make money when all the stocks are low they will buy..You should check to see who sold just before the markets started to drop & who buys just before they rise
1458 2018-12-24 18:52:30 Do you know how much people lose to stocks everyday...
Make u people no talk what u dey talk...we use money to get money..
1459 2018-12-24 18:52:22 Guess you don't have stocks... What are you thankful for?
1460 2018-12-24 18:52:15 The Federal Reserve is the blame. People are selling stocks and investing in bonds. That is what always happens when interest rates increase.
1461 2018-12-24 18:52:13 Multi-year bearmarket incoming for stocks and #fiat currencies. #Crypto bearmarket end is approaching faster and faster.
1462 2018-12-24 18:52:05 Maybe this market was @realDonaldTrump ‘s gift to consumers to bargain shop for stocks... #silverlining
1463 2018-12-24 18:52:00 Cool. Did we freeze Mulvaney's stocks before the market opened, or is this manufactured crisis the most obvious grift since Gould and Fisk?
1464 2018-12-24 18:51:59 Stocks are at lows that haven’t been seen in a long time. Don’t let this fool you. Buy stocks!
1465 2018-12-24 18:51:55 December is usually a healthy month for stocks, but this month has been the worst since 1931. Wasn't that the Great Depression?  Wow, amazing what happens when we have a smart businessman as POTUS isn't it?
1466 2018-12-24 18:51:46 Can you be more specific about what you mean by capital strike? Do you mean a flight of capital, or just that rich people will go all cash? Or just that stocks will be valued at a lower multiple of earnings(i.e. "crash")?
1467 2018-12-24 18:51:43 Stocks dive again: What you should know about markets' worst month in a decade, and what's ahead.                        MEGA is a joke- ruining lives!  Merry Christmas to the worse president in my lifetime
1468 2018-12-24 18:51:39 If you’re trying to argue for individual stocks right now, don’t. There’s no point in trying to find the bottom in $AAPL or $AMZN cause it’s “cheap” when the entire market is getting blown out! $SPY
1469 2018-12-24 18:51:39 Not very merry: US stocks plunge before Christmas
1470 2018-12-24 18:51:36 U.S. oil prices take biggest drop in 3 months, tumbling along with stocks Monday
1471 2018-12-24 18:51:30 Given the meltdown in oil and US stocks these should have fallen more.
1472 2018-12-24 18:51:23 I love how MAGA could never give Obama credit for saving the economy and the stock market.....the Trump takes over and continues it, with no mention of Obama, and now it dives and it is Democrat fault. I gave Trump credit for stocks when they rise...U spew lies now it's falling
1473 2018-12-24 18:51:23 That Jared and Ivanka wanted to short some stocks?
1474 2018-12-24 18:51:23 Rest in piece my irl friend who bought tech stocks back in the summer

I think he dead now
1475 2018-12-24 18:51:21 I wish I could hide Apple News inside the Stocks app. It more often than not gets in the way.
1476 2018-12-24 18:51:11 The 1% drives these downturns. They commit mass sell-offs to drive the market down, and then buy it all back up when stocks are low. Then, they say they "lost all this money " so they can't pay us living wages or provide us healthcare and go buy another house or yacht.
1477 2018-12-24 18:50:39 Lincoln was such a good president.

He predicted Tweets before Twitter.

Real president like him would make stocks go up 24/7.
1478 2018-12-24 18:50:21 Most of his base don’t own stocks. Don’t understand the stock market. And he knows this. So he can run an alternate narrative to reality and they’ll eat it up, and at the same time deride the media for reporting otherwise.

Crazy times man.
1479 2018-12-24 18:50:19 Ok now stocks are down a bit more...
1480 2018-12-24 18:50:08 The next 28 days offers huge opportunity on ftse stocks ... bear market seem to be sentiment and geopolitical driven and that is historically short term .... I am optimistic overall and intend to buy oil majors and banks :)
1481 2018-12-24 18:49:50 Everyone wants to drum up reasons but sometimes stocks are just overbought. Then it doesn’t take much bad news to send investors running for the hills
1482 2018-12-24 18:49:46 WH Press Sec: DO NOT MENTION STOCKS!! AVERT!! ABORT!! Instead remind America Mexico will pay for the wall..

1484 2018-12-24 18:49:40 The idiot was completely unnecessary and nasty and immature—i apologize, you didn’t deserve it, and i shouldn’t have said it. I’ve made lots of money in stocks too, but what I was referring to is the direct ownership of marijuana ventures by every day people.
1485 2018-12-24 18:49:31 Yes I’m still salty my robin lost to prestons inkling when i had 2 stocks, don’t judge

1492 2018-12-24 18:49:00 Is it the Fed's job to make sure stocks go up?

1496 2018-12-24 18:48:32 I was promised my 401k would only go up under the @realDonaldTrump

This is the worst Christmas in history.

Was going to spend my 401k on a good asset like a Lamborghini.

This is a disgrace.

Fuck CNN too.

1497 2018-12-24 18:48:26 I wish Donny agree when he was praising the stock market gains as being directly because of him, that if the stocks dropped to pre-trump numbers that he would resign. At the time he would have never imagined such a thing could happen... and neither would we. Stocks in the Orange
1498 2018-12-24 18:48:22 Everytime he says smthing about economy, stocks are going down  i think he makes in purpose
1499 2018-12-24 18:48:19 Instead of firing the Fed chairman, Trump should resign. Then watch stocks soar!
1500 2018-12-24 18:48:02 Stocks tanking. Parks closed. Unemployment just shot up. Growth slowing. Warmest winter in history.

MAKE AMERICA GREATER BIGLY!
1501 2018-12-24 18:48:01 Stocks will be a buy after the third rate cut.
1502 2018-12-24 18:47:53 AYO THAT NIGGA STILL GOT 3 STOCKS LEFT!!

1504 2018-12-24 18:47:22 S&P is now down 20%. Who knows what the economy (or the market) does next year, but if you view stocks as businesses, this is one of those times that comes along once in a while where it’s great to be buying. Lots of value out there. Fun times at the office now. Merry Christmas!
1505 2018-12-24 18:47:18 Stocks can go higher and lower than you think. Question is: what was your plan and what is your plan going forward?
1506 2018-12-24 18:47:17 I wonder what's up with the stock market. Stocks have been going down for a while now, I'm a bit concerned as what this could mean, I need to research what's causing this. This is why you don't base your presidential success on the stock market.
1507 2018-12-24 18:47:12 Great buying opportunity, isn't it? Why would you not want stocks when they are on sale.
1508 2018-12-24 18:46:59 Company insider trading ... yes. Because those have to be filed with SEC. But shorting stocks? No.
1509 2018-12-24 18:46:55 Trump was totally taking credit when the stocks were going up. You can’t have it both ways.
1510 2018-12-24 18:46:51 The issue in 2008 was that it directly impacted people’s homes, which is where most people’s wealth is based. This seems more like the 2000 tech bubble than anything (cheap credit ending causing overvalued stocks to fall, & the impact mostly being on retirement portfolios)
1511 2018-12-24 18:46:43 So, in other words the Fed kept rates at near zero for Obama and are now raising it during Trump. The Fed should have raised rates long ago. Imagine if they got ahead of things 10+ years ago, we wouldn't have had a housing collapse. Maybe avoided an inflation in stocks. 1/2
1512 2018-12-24 18:46:43 You think only the rich own stocks?  Seriously?
1513 2018-12-24 18:46:38 Are you saying that Mnuchin instructed the Plunge Prevention Team to short stocks?

1514 2018-12-24 18:46:37 It's official: Stocks enter bear market following Christmas Eve rout
1515 2018-12-24 18:46:33 Trump has officially ruined Christmas 2018......

U.S. stocks plunged on Monday in their worst day of Christmas Eve trading ever, as the S&P 500 entered a bear market.

Thank @realDonaldTrump for the Worst Stock Market performance since the Great Depression.

What a dick.
1516 2018-12-24 18:46:32 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to improve your depression
1517 2018-12-24 18:46:31 That's gonna be a rough Christmas.. *stocks up on bullets and guns*
1518 2018-12-24 18:46:26 And who do you think will be buying up all those failed stocks?

Not the poor shmuck that was saving for retirement with a 401k
1519 2018-12-24 18:46:24 Stock markets been crashing almost everyday lol if you go back to my old tweets you will find that I said take out your stocks. Now I’m waiting for the US DOLLAR TO CRAP ITS PANTS OFF! Really soon you will see how this world going to change. Make sure you adapt 
1520 2018-12-24 18:46:14 “U.S. stocks plunged on Monday in their worst day of Christmas Eve trading ever, as the S&P 500 entered a bear market.”  The only problem our economy has is YOU Donnie. RESIGN now.
1521 2018-12-24 18:46:13 I’ve completely bought in on the dividend stocks. You absolutely need your money to make you money no matter what.
1522 2018-12-24 18:46:12 Seems like they tanked the stock market on purpose. Is anyone looking into Trump,  Mnuchin, or their friends for shorting stocks?
1523 2018-12-24 18:46:07 Watching stock analyst projecting income and potential growth of stocks today is like watching someone attempt to swim across a lake with a cinder block on each foot.

#STOCKS #Trumpstockmarketcrash
1524 2018-12-24 18:45:56 1. My multitudes thank you for acknowledging all of us. 
2. You're right. I have money just in stocks though -- just using @RobinhoodApp , not a Roth or 401K
1525 2018-12-24 18:45:53 EXACTLY!  Market crashes, FED panics, 2008 looks like a small blip, money printing on steroids, purchasing stocks, helicopter money, Hyperinflation is the endpoint. #Weimar Got gold?  Greenspan, Bernanke, Yellen, @neelkashkari you are going into the history books with JOHN LAW.

Find good stocks to buy. In a bear market, the stocks of both good and bad companies tend to go down. ...
Hunt for dividends. ...
Unearth gems with bond ratings. ...

Carefully use margin. ...
1527 2018-12-24 18:45:49 Has anyone checked to see if Jared and Ivanka are shorting any stocks?
1528 2018-12-24 18:45:45 Mr. Schumer I think you're also overestimating the real world importance of the stock market to most individuals. The mid and lower class don't have a ton of wealth in retirement or stocks. This is an upper class loss, which is probably fine with many in the green wing.
1529 2018-12-24 18:45:39 Donny is going to order them to make the stocks go up, isn't he?
1530 2018-12-24 18:45:37 Sell your stocks !!
1531 2018-12-24 18:45:20 Worst Christmas Eve performance for stocks ever. S&P officially closes in bear market #NotWinning
1532 2018-12-24 18:45:19 Excellent Call by Jim.

Jim you seem to be better at calling broad macro stock market moves rather than individual stocks calls
1533 2018-12-24 18:45:19 Subhuman scum. This is why putting people in the stocks has its use.
1534 2018-12-24 18:45:18 I agree. But i think its even better.. all Fiat currencies have been subjekt to premine, duringmine and aftermine.. most stocks the same.. bitcoin is as close to perfect as one could get
1535 2018-12-24 18:45:12 PPL ARE LOSING MONEY!!!! PPL getting out of stocks and changing to cash to many uncertainties in the financial markets with interest rate uncertainties for companies and investors..LIKE MR. POTTER said in its a wonder life i'll give YOU 50 CENTS ON THE DOLLAR!! 

MERRY CHRISTMAS!
1536 2018-12-24 18:45:11 he always has said a president is judged to do well or bad by the stock market... now that the latter is coming true he will try to distance himself from that fact. but the truth is a fixed point... i believe he knows that if the stocks go down, he is in personal, legal peril.
1537 2018-12-24 18:44:58 Will you be using futures or stocks?  I would prefer stocks so I can apply options.
1538 2018-12-24 18:44:52 Worst day in history for a Christmas Eve close for the stock market. The S&P 500 has its biggest annual drop since 2008. All stocks on the DOW closed lower today. 2018 is trending to become the worse downturn in stock market history since 1931, the great recession era.
1539 2018-12-24 18:44:47 yeah ok, you found the 5% of the dogs in stocks while the rest of the 95% are in ATH...leave it guys, admit crypto is -95% of the 95% of all projects and hope for a better 2019...trying to compare stocks with crypto is pointless...take care and merry xmas to all
1540 2018-12-24 18:44:39 Well glad I didn't have any stocks! But the good news is the dollar is worth less and everything cost more. #TrumpResign

1541 2018-12-24 18:44:38 reflecting on your loneliness my thoughts turn to children alone because parents have been deported, retired people devastated by stocks which have tanked. Allies who feel abandoned. Families of all cultures living in fear of shootings and brutality.

1545 2018-12-24 18:44:12 $SPY Now we're officially in a bear market, at the weekly 200 day moving average and defensive stocks have sold off, we can finally rally.
1546 2018-12-24 18:44:06 You have $10,000. 

You can only invest in crypto or stocks and you have to hold for 5yrs.

Retweet for crypto.

Favorite for stocks.
1547 2018-12-24 18:43:59 Maybe you can get them to buy some stocks too since you’re now second only to Herbert Hoover in wealth destruction.
1548 2018-12-24 18:43:51 An actual stock in Google has a face value of 99 cents. Like ART or REAL ESTATE stocks are worthless unless you find some one willing to BUY them and until you sell they are just "estimated" value. This in any other industry would be criminal.
1549 2018-12-24 18:43:48 Paul Krugman:
Remember, when stocks go up, it's proof of Trump's genius, but when they go down, it's someone else's fault. Probably a conspiracy by the deep state's allies, the deep private sector.
1550 2018-12-24 18:43:47 Are they trying to tank the market? Shorting stocks? These are serious possibilities
1551 2018-12-24 18:43:42 Gawd, we’re fucked.  Time to liquidate all stocks.
1552 2018-12-24 18:43:37 apple stocks rise by 30%.
1553 2018-12-24 18:43:26 Dividend income remains safe, stocks going on sale, less RMDs for next year, and ability to transfer more from deferred tax traditional IRA to never taxed Roth IRA. When stocks recover this period will be seen as a great Xmas gift. Santa Claus is here!
1554 2018-12-24 18:43:04 Use the 25 billion to buy stocks
1555 2018-12-24 18:43:04 Nobody wants to hold stocks over holidays, it's like holding hot water in your bare hand.
1556 2018-12-24 18:43:04 This committed lefty has some stocks and they’re all tanking. So much for capitalism.

1563 2018-12-24 18:42:03 Like everyone else in this corrupt administration. I’ll bet Mnuchin shorted stocks on Friday before his phone calls Saturday.
1564 2018-12-24 18:41:58 Stocks crash when Democrats win and talk of increased taxes turns into action by them.  Socialism works -until the other guy’s money runs out.
1565 2018-12-24 18:41:49 Jesse where do you see fair market value for indices? PEs on a lot of stocks starting to look real good, especially like some of the good dividend stocks.
1566 2018-12-24 18:41:46 I would like to invest in some stocks
1567 2018-12-24 18:41:32 its bad enough to play with only 2 stocks DONT PLAY WITH ONE STOCK YOU IDIOT
1568 2018-12-24 18:41:25 It will for Donald Trump and his ilk. They will use the opportunity to buy stocks at low low prices and then when they go back up will have made a killing.
1569 2018-12-24 18:41:17 The semi-poor own stocks because they have no choice as this is where the money they "invest" in their retirement are placed. They take YOUR money and gamble with it then you assume all the risks.
1570 2018-12-24 18:41:08 Instead of Socks sTuffer, we have STocks suffer.  Welcome to Trumplandia’s Xmas Wonderland. How appropriate that a misplaced “T” makes all the difference.
1571 2018-12-24 18:41:05 I haven't read one Wall Street clown beating the drum to buy stocks at these levels. They loved stocks when markets were 20% higher. The economy is ok, for now, profits still growing. Pin drops.

1572 2018-12-24 18:40:44 @stockspy456 don’t think so? Think it will go down until all stocks are 0? That makes sense
1573 2018-12-24 18:40:43 So on the plus side, when I get paid this week, I'll get a lot more shares of all my stocks and funds. That should keep me in @SPAMbrand and @kraftbrand mac & cheese if I get to retire.

1576 2018-12-24 18:40:31 Last 2 mths US fiscal deficit has run at a $1.8T annual rate; most think it will normalize to the $1T target over next 10 mths.  If stocks don't rip to highs, it won't.  Who buys the extra issuance, and at what price?

1584 2018-12-24 18:39:41 Does this mean it’s a good time to buy stocks
1585 2018-12-24 18:39:40 Alone, huh? Could that have to do with the fact that lots of people want nothing to do with you these days? Oh, by the way, my stocks look great these days. Thanks for all the winning, dipshit.
1586 2018-12-24 18:39:35 @EdKrassen @krassenstein Is anyone investigating how the Trumps are profiting off manipulating the stocks? Everything he does is to get money. He's doing something with his shares bc he is purposely tweeting things that he knows will make the market go up or down.
1587 2018-12-24 18:39:34 Wonder what stocks the trumps and trump dummy corps have shorted. $5 says they are the ones with the biggest losses.
1588 2018-12-24 18:39:15 Bear market is when stocks are down over 20% from their recent highs. Also another recession indicator.
1589 2018-12-24 18:39:11 Normal people have stocks and 401ks too dude, maybe take a step back.

1596 2018-12-24 18:38:51 Scam calls are soaring.  Local crime is soaring.  Stores all over high rent areas are closing.  Stocks selling off 25%+.    Hopefully a depression isn’t around the corner
1597 2018-12-24 18:38:23 Earnings growth and QE.  Even pessimists have to admit that the earnings growth for the S&P 500 stocks has been impressive over the past 8 years.  That with the QE and Fed put drove the market to record highs.  Now earnings are healthy but slowing, and QE is QT + DC chaos = down!
1598 2018-12-24 18:38:18 This is a friendly reminder that stock market corrections are the absolute worst time to sell your Stocks. They are the best time to buy more if you’ve been sitting on Cash.

1607 2018-12-24 18:37:18 Y'know who else is going to lose a shitload of money? School teachers and all manner of middle-class workers whose retirement savings consist of stocks held in 401k's, 403b's, and union pension funds.

Seriously, dude, fuck this take.
1608 2018-12-24 18:37:15 Unless you want to book losses for tax purposes and re-buy the same stocks at a lower price.  But I would probably leave that to the professionals.
1609 2018-12-24 18:37:14 Shorting stocks is reactionary because it ensures the survival of the market, it is the capitalist system hedging against itself.

If a company is 50x leveraged and loses 40% as they did in 2008, that's a 2000% loss the ends up covered by the general public.
1610 2018-12-24 18:37:11 December is usually a healthy month for stocks, but this month has been the worst since 1931.

1620 2018-12-24 18:36:19 $jnce $Fprx falls under High risk(HR) category and Big holders are reducing their exposure to HR stocks, once dumping is done it should be back above >5
1621 2018-12-24 18:36:04 Trump blames Fed's decision to change rates....a week ago. Apparently, trump thinks the rate change was so bad that it went back in time and caused stocks to drop weeks prior.
1622 2018-12-24 18:36:03 See, if Trump had a few dozen more IQ points but was still himself, he'd short a bunch of stocks before tanking the market.  But as it is, he's too dumb to even make money off his own chaos.
1623 2018-12-24 18:35:49 #BREAKING: Stocks plunged Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 653 points.
1624 2018-12-24 18:35:46 You may wanna go buy some stocks today. Merry Christmas investors!
1625 2018-12-24 18:35:38 Peter, the economy and so called markets are only distantly connected. Trying to derive stock direction from macroeconomic stats is foolish. It's why you were wrong for 10 years. Stocks performance is based on debt availability.
1626 2018-12-24 18:35:38 I don't hate everything about Trump's policies, but you can't cut tax, allow debt to climb 1.5 trillion, get into a trade war with China and others, and ask for an expensive wall and expect stocks to continue upward. This is not about the Fed.
1627 2018-12-24 18:35:36 Trump’s comments exacerbated the sell-off on Wall Street, and stocks had their worst year since 2008. This is the largest December decline since the 1930s. The S&P 500 closed down 2.7 percent after a shortened trading session because of the Christmas holiday.
1628 2018-12-24 18:35:27 Let’s see what GDP is. That’s a better indicator of economic prosperity than the stock market. Stocks are mostly a bunch of rich guys.
1629 2018-12-24 18:35:25 Wait... never mind, yup stocks are definitely still going down, wait... nah never mind.
1630 2018-12-24 18:35:22 The only plan orange business God has is to enrich himself, that's the reason 4 tariffs, waiting for his CUT! Stocks down today as bad as 1930's. Trump went bankrupt 5 times after his papa died, who got him out of many financial jams. Trump is a BIG SPENDER only! Don't be a fool!
1631 2018-12-24 18:35:21 #Trump Perhaps the new theme of the Trump Administration should be the old Carmen Miranda song: "Yes, we have no bananas; we have no bananas today."  In his repeated FED-bashing, Trump has made it much more difficult for the FED to backtrack, even if it wanted to.

1632 2018-12-24 18:35:12 Hey what's a stocks.
1633 2018-12-24 18:35:10 Stocks take Deep plunge...more than 600 pts after president gives confusing signals about the economy
1634 2018-12-24 18:34:48 I mean both can be true. It is mostly rich people who own stocks, but also hurts people who have money in 401ks. Which is a whole different argument that we should find a better retirement system that isn't tied to the stock market to prevent shit like this.
1635 2018-12-24 18:34:45 More like the ‘stocks and bonds’ villains.
1636 2018-12-24 18:34:44 Special shout out to Jerome Powell. Hope you a Merry fkn Christmas. Thanks for the discounted stocks.
1637 2018-12-24 18:34:39 I love how the right wing side of Twitter ignores the stocks when it goes down almost 1000 points but when it goes up, they are so happy and everything kek
1638 2018-12-24 18:34:38 I bought Canadian Bank stocks when I invested. Its not great growth but its safe and steady. Anything American is way to volatile.
1639 2018-12-24 18:34:36 Biggest lesson my dad taught me as a kid was the value of picking high dividend stocks and doing a reinvestment plan. It's not always popular but it's always profitable.
1640 2018-12-24 18:34:14 So carrying your analogy forward, the Fed has drive but not precision and that’s why our stock market is in a nosedive? 

This feels bigger than a lack of precision on the green. This is you. Ask the people trading stocks what they truly think.

1644 2018-12-24 18:33:59 Stocks @ 19,827 before you took office!! Like your Presidency!!! going down!

1646 2018-12-24 18:33:48 Stocks drop, crypto rises
1647 2018-12-24 18:33:45 Markets fall 650 points at closing as Trump pins blame on the Fed
The decline marked one of the worst Christmas Eves ever for U.S. stocks. President Trump tried to assign sole blame for the sell-off to the Federal Reserve, likening the central bank to a golfer who “can’t putt.”
1648 2018-12-24 18:33:44 Yes but they like buying back stocks they sold a week ago at a high rate, crash the market with crazy ass shit, then wa la , great deal on good stock.  #Individual1 loves dirty deals
1649 2018-12-24 18:33:37 does this mean it is a good time to buy some quality stocks...like energy (oil & power sector)???
1650 2018-12-24 18:33:25 "Wall Street saw more losses, with stocks on track for their worst year since 2008'   From the NYTimes front page.  NOT Fake News people. Let's just roll back to 2008, though honestly, if we could roll back to Obama, I would be in heaven.
1651 2018-12-24 18:33:23 Merry Christmas, @stevenmnuchin1 !  Why dont you tweet about your call to the CDC to ask how our antivirus stocks are?  Do it from the nuclear bunker, eating beanie weenies!
1652 2018-12-24 18:33:20 buy stocks, options prob very big returns but also super high risk is market don't turn fast enough.
1653 2018-12-24 18:33:17 Isn't funny that after TWO YEARS record setting markets, the moment the dems are elected to take the House, stocks plummet. Coincidence?
1654 2018-12-24 18:33:07 The market was due to crash.  It's been 9 years since the last crash, it's more due to the Fed than Trump, but both are caught in a 7-10 year cycle.  Buy gold or silver in the short term and be ready to buy stocks, when no one else wants them.
1655 2018-12-24 18:33:06 Thanks to Steve Mnuchin for the heads-up.  I sold off my bank stocks first thing this morning.

1657 2018-12-24 18:32:52 Stocks are plummeting and the government is shut down but trump is still good for the economy right? 
1658 2018-12-24 18:32:51 Trump lashed out at the Federal Reserve after administration officials spent the weekend trying to assure the public and financial markets that Jerome Powell's job as Fed chairman was safe. Stocks, already down, intensified their fall after Trump's tweet.
1659 2018-12-24 18:32:48 i love that the month i start investing in stocks is the same month the dow plummets to an 8 yr low
1660 2018-12-24 18:32:38 Everyone that has a retirement account has stocks.  Dah
1661 2018-12-24 18:32:35 Merry Christmas to all.. The start of 2019 will be a interesting one for the stocks.. as we leave on a bearish note, I think 2019 will be bright. Hang on bag holders, it’s time to buy not sell, no fear! SQ JPM CVS ACB DBX PVTL
1662 2018-12-24 18:32:25 Potentially. Most likely limits on much you can take out. Its happened before. And they have the ability to take peoples money out of the banks and 401ks. If stocks get bad enough you could see large bank runs. Everyone trying to get their money out. But banks dont keep that much
1663 2018-12-24 18:32:23 Stocks close with sharp losses, Dow -650 points.
1664 2018-12-24 18:32:17 Sadly yes. One must keep a level head.  The sky is not falling and the markets WILL recover. (Stocks are on sale). Let's all count our blessings. Merry Christmas and Happy New year!

1669 2018-12-24 18:31:44 Stocks close sharply lower after Trump again attacks Federal Reserve and its independence (via @AP)
1670 2018-12-24 18:31:36 GK, I thought bear markets just sort of end in a wimper of widespread indifference to stocks. A rally here? Wouldn't it be very suspicious?.
1671 2018-12-24 18:31:25 I'm thinking he's doing it on purpose. Someone in his family is moving his stocks around and making him money.
1672 2018-12-24 18:31:24 @cvpayne Hi Charles. As this market plummets, who is buying these stocks. Are they company buy backs?
1673 2018-12-24 18:31:20 Delusion that the stock market *would* be in president's control if not for the blasted Fed chair is cartoon-villain-level false narrrative. 
As likely: investors are leaving stocks b/c "opportunity funds" are better for taxes and it's the end of the year. #StockMarket
1674 2018-12-24 18:31:18 Lol it’s a must. I just have my stocks powder coated for summer but I really like them
1675 2018-12-24 18:31:17 All except the stocks. I have serious doubts he has much, if any, of a stock portfolio.
1676 2018-12-24 18:31:10 I am measuring from day of election. 10% is also not bad considering that he’s trying to recast global trade and that was always going to sock stocks.
1677 2018-12-24 18:30:58 If only I had the cash and the knowledge to short stocks.
1678 2018-12-24 18:30:57 Never seen a president who's right so often but always for the wrong reasons lol

1687 2018-12-24 18:30:16 Most of them make their money through stocks and crazy CEO salaries. Zuckerberg doesn't work billions of times harder than people making $50k/yr. A CEO making 1.5mil a year doesn't work harder than most of his employees making way, way less. That's nonsense.

Trump is realizing his true ability to dictate and control the health of the markets.  It only makes sense that he created an environment for short selling by being volatile himself with his antics

1710 2018-12-24 18:27:43 Unrealized gains/losses for those still holding stocks. Nothing is lost until one sells their shares for less than they bought them for.

1719 2018-12-24 18:26:24 @USA_First_2016 remember predicting that the Dow would recover and approach 27,000 by the end of October? I should have taken you up on your offer to buy my stocks!  #MAGAMoron

1722 2018-12-24 18:26:07 Case in point, stocks were stabilizing today until @realDonaldTrump’s @federalreserve tweet came out - he and @stevenmnuchin1 are exacerbating needless panic
1723 2018-12-24 18:25:46 Again I would probably be pissed if I owned any stocks lmao

1729 2018-12-24 18:25:11 Stocks are thumbing. Tariffs are killing our farmers. You caused this mess. Not the Fed!
1730 2018-12-24 18:24:59 Is The Fed’s Jerome Powell wrong for raising rates? 

The short answer: No. He’s basically saying that we have to close the casino before things REALLY get out of hand.

Really interesting action in fixed income CEFs today with some being way up while stocks were down big. Most underlying ETFs/Debt down too. Huge reversal from recent trading. Good day here, no complaints.
1732 2018-12-24 18:24:52 Sure. But most people have no idea why stocks went up. Most still think this economy is strong
1733 2018-12-24 18:24:46 I was going to joke that I was surprised WI didn't have that, and then I remembered WI is always prepared with their own stocks of beer and liquor.
1734 2018-12-24 18:24:33 Hopefully all my dad's stocks tanked recently, considering how much he values his financial investments over his actual children.

1735 2018-12-24 18:24:21 Seth. Watch the good U stocks  with low share counts. Appia and Cvv seemed to find support early. Like Western last Summer And now. 4rth grade math: 7000 U308 bulls invest 1000 into Cvv at .25. There goes 28m shares of Cvv. That’s  just a simple example that shows the effect.
1736 2018-12-24 18:23:57 I wish someone would report on marie Antoinette mnuchin's stocks to see if she shorted after listening to hubby's phone calls...
1737 2018-12-24 18:23:53 Stocks tanking again. All 2018 gains wiped out. Worst since Great Depression. On the verge of a recession. (NO recession for 8 years of Pres Obama, NO recession for 8 years of Pres Clinton.) Just some facts...
1738 2018-12-24 18:23:41 Follow for what? zero news? Stocks will disappoint once again. Just watch tv and u will gain more out of it then thinking JPM will bring any value 
1739 2018-12-24 18:23:28 You forgot to list deranged President in your stocks fall on column.
1740 2018-12-24 18:23:27 You've been making irrational decisions pumping TSLA & go go stocks for yrs in an irrationally priced Zirp world. This is pybck & your accnt will not stick their heads in the sand. They ONLY care about the closing value of their accnts. Don't be a baggie bro, sell tsla!

1744 2018-12-24 18:22:50 It will eventually, but this feels more orderly, which suggests to me that there's a decent amount further to go.

Free money for 9 years, they it gets taken away.
Zero interest rates for 9 years, then it gets taken away.

Incongruity:

Stocks should stay nice and high.
1745 2018-12-24 18:22:49 tfw with POTUS45's new SecDef (subsq. of Feb 2019) if those stock markets tip back upwards and in defense stocks, it may be some kind of another reason to worry. Meanwhile the paper trail it's not left as yet

1749 2018-12-24 18:22:15 It seems to me that many sell Berkshire to buy stocks they perceive to be cheaper.
1750 2018-12-24 18:22:15 Unfortunately, navigating mutual funds, ETFs, and stocks isn’t easy and requires some research. We no longer live in a time where we can count on employer stock or the Blue Chips to pull us through, IMHO.
1751 2018-12-24 18:22:11 Llevo diciéndolo desde la semana pasada, con intención de que lo lea cualquiera que tenga sus ahorros en stocks allí:

RUN WHILE YOU CAN.
1752 2018-12-24 18:21:52 Maybe they’re purposely trying to drive the market down so corporations can do their stock buy backs on the cheap. Drive the market down so your friends benefit. Will be interesting to see who snaps up which stocks after Xmas.
1753 2018-12-24 18:21:23 This is a just plain and simple rigging of the market.

If things are manufactured to crash, smaller players in the market are forced out and the rich can buy up stocks for pennies on the dollars throwing GINI coefficient even further out of whack.
1754 2018-12-24 18:21:23 If you have long term financial goals.  (Don’t need the money for the next 10 years. ). Now is the time to buy stocks.
1755 2018-12-24 18:21:17 They're probably also getting all Dems to sell off their stocks to destroy our economy. All prep for 2020.
1756 2018-12-24 18:21:16 I am liking the oil stocks for a big snap back, but it won't happen to April-May (unless geopolitical). Regardless of outside sources, cheaper prices equal greater demand and already reading a lot of permanian companies pulling back on CAPEX
1757 2018-12-24 18:21:13 maybe, just maybe, is my thinking as a relative noob, if this bearish OMG WTF mood persists in US markets it could setup one of the most spectacular blast in stocks upwards

HUGE divergence between US economy and what Zero Hedge (I love that site) type are making it to be
1758 2018-12-24 18:21:08 just sell stocks
1759 2018-12-24 18:21:00 You have to start asking yourself who is shorting bank stocks...
1760 2018-12-24 18:20:53 Already working you are new comer I think. Only index and few stocks maintaining otherwise stock market corrections started from December 2017.  But everyone facing problems
1761 2018-12-24 18:20:51 the America heart is in Stocks & pensions no one will ever run around with a barrel of cash ... maybe a burger&fries
1762 2018-12-24 18:20:40 What about Impeachment Money.  The stocks will go up after you are impeached or sent to jail with your family.
1763 2018-12-24 18:20:35 So now, @realdonaldtrump, oser & illegitimate president, your lack of business "acumen"--look it up in a dictionary, you functionally illiterate imbecile--has led you to preside over the worst Christmas Eve ever for stocks. That & your loser's gov't shutdown will be your legacy.
1764 2018-12-24 18:20:11 The #markets closing stops the panic selling in #stocks.
1765 2018-12-24 18:20:09 Sold my entire portfolio the day after tRump was elected. My Mom called the other day freaking about the stock market tanking. I said I sold all my stocks I’m not worried. She said OMG where is the $? In a money market where tRump can’t mess it up.
1766 2018-12-24 18:20:08 Down down -653.17 (2.91%) 
21,792.20 

That is what I meant by does this moron know the world reads his tweets? The weird phone calls from Mnuchin and then this moron tweets that.  The world then says: "Holy shit!" and dumps stocks.
1767 2018-12-24 18:20:07 HAVE NO DOUBT - they are *personally* benefitting from the chaos. Probably short-selling stocks.
1768 2018-12-24 18:20:03 Hold that crypto or at least the better projects & Btc. Its about to have a  rebound this year. I wouldn't get excited about it tell Btc closes above 6800$ then that will be huge. If you know how to short some of those stocks will be great or buy oversold ones sell bounces.
1769 2018-12-24 18:20:01 $SPY reset your mind. Enjoy your family. Become a trader and don’t get attached to your stocks. Stay cash before you go to bed. 
1770 2018-12-24 18:19:46 Markets are over sold ... RSI is at 30 or below...... no blood in the streets yet but I beleave some stocks are attractive here... at least start dollar cost avg ... my buddy Greg Grasso from fast money seems to agree... I like .... AMD... LEN.... HBAN
1771 2018-12-24 18:19:36 #BREAKING on @OANN: Stocks on Wall Street continue to fall, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping more than 600 points. #OANN
1772 2018-12-24 18:19:35 Stocks - Dow Tumbles Again as Mnuchin Saps the Market’s Holiday Spirit
1773 2018-12-24 18:19:25 Thanks, Trump, for making our stocks fall!
1774 2018-12-24 18:19:21 With stocks plummeting, hitting 52 week lows, businesses failing. Wasn't the tax cut supposed to not let this happens? What happens if it continues
1775 2018-12-24 18:19:16 ‘Twas the afternoon before Christmas, when all through the newsroom, not a creature was stirring, not even — a house is on fire in Norridgewock, there’s a home invasion reported in China, stocks have plunged sharply, and homemade cookies are disappearing.
1776 2018-12-24 18:18:59 I wonder what stocks they shorted. I wanna know how to get into this corrupt billionaire club.
1777 2018-12-24 18:18:59 1) Consumer staples stocks 
2) European bonds 
3) Asian residential RE (esp. Chin, HK, TW, Auz)
1778 2018-12-24 18:18:56 If Trump thought he had leverage over Xi on Dec 3rd(ES 2800) as he openly said China’s economy is suffering then we are 450 pts lower now and going lower every time he tweets. Maybe China is dumping crazy stocks crazy to gain leverage over Trump.
1779 2018-12-24 18:18:51 Stocks down -653.17. 

Crazy.
1780 2018-12-24 18:18:41 Stocks are below what they were in 1944???

Merry  Christmas to all-
1781 2018-12-24 18:18:22 LawProfBlawg stocks this by the case.
1782 2018-12-24 18:18:19 It's the one mistake he has made. These low oil prices will kill the shale developers. They are his voters and they will be punished. I was mostly out of oil stocks by June. I'm buying again, perhaps a little early. $BP $CVX $RDS.A $XOM $EQNR are all great PEs with great divvys!
1783 2018-12-24 18:18:18 Ahhh the hookup is so key! My dad has a guy in Germany he goes to about once a decade and stocks up heavy
1784 2018-12-24 18:18:06 Not whining!  We all know real economy is in recession and has been in bad shape for years, need stocks higher to compensate.  2019 will be a great year for markets.
1785 2018-12-24 18:18:03 Nifty cannot insulate itself from global volatility. Add to that domestic issues like election in 2019!!
Keep cash ready to buy quality stocks
1786 2018-12-24 18:18:00 Definate that its his fault the fed pumped up stocks over the last 8 years w financial engineering/buybacks etc etc. I too am blaming any losses on anyone but myself.
1787 2018-12-24 18:17:36 These people obviously don’t own stocks. You could point that arrow straight down.
1788 2018-12-24 18:17:34 Bring back the cane to schools and the stocks to town squares, I say. Let kids learn discipline in the most effective way! The state of teenagers.
1789 2018-12-24 18:17:29 Dow Down Big Time.WHY,Something Just Not Right Here?Country Booming Yet This?Anyone Explain.?The Saying,When Stocks Go Low/Low,You Buy/Buy.?
1790 2018-12-24 18:17:23 Stock market crashing? Na, stocks on sale.
1791 2018-12-24 18:17:16 As soon as Trump opened his mouth on Twitter this morning, stocks tanks again for the day!
1792 2018-12-24 18:17:00 Because he is making money hand over fist shorting stocks
1793 2018-12-24 18:16:59 I mean once or twice, sure. You clearly don't have stocks or a 401K
1794 2018-12-24 18:16:55 Your bizarre rants about the Fed prompted this Wall Street sell-off. Stocks were on track for their worst year since 2008 and the largest December decline since the 1930s. #TrumpSlump
#TrumpChristmasShutdown #TrumpResign
1795 2018-12-24 18:16:54 Trump is blaming someone else for this, he only takes credit when stocks are up. The funny part is his loyal followers don't see this.
1796 2018-12-24 18:16:47 I find it odd that no one has criticized Mnuchin for being out of the country during the worst single month for stocks since 1931 and during a government shutdown. 

The optics of that are extremely bad.
1797 2018-12-24 18:16:46 Investors when they see that the #StockMarket dropped over 650 pts today 
#WOW #DOW #DowJones #Stocks #DonaldTrump #Trump @realDonaldTrump $INDU $SPY $RUT $QQQ $AAPL $AMZN $MSFT $GOOGL $NFLX $FB $TWTR $HD
1798 2018-12-24 18:16:40 @realDonaldTrump Instead of trying to fire the Fed chief, how about you close the stock market by decree? Would help stabilizing stocks.
1799 2018-12-24 18:16:39 It’s over. The longest bull market EVER in stocks is officially over. Now what? Even though Christmas is tomorrow it’s not too late to put your stock shopping list together. Great bargains out there!
1800 2018-12-24 18:16:37 Stocks are down 643 points. You gonna take credit for it?
1801 2018-12-24 18:16:30 I read a day trading service (just for interest) and people shorting stocks are making 10-11% on average in a few days. Whereas the rest of us are seeing our retirement funds lose 13% or so. WARNING - don't short unless you know what you're doing as you can lose BIG.
1802 2018-12-24 18:16:30 I held last time. So I know I’ll hold this time. I have a high percentage of stocks for long term investments. But some bonds to help steady the ride.
1803 2018-12-24 18:16:29 Hey Sean! How are your stocks doing this last week?????
1804 2018-12-24 18:16:24 That’s what you should actually recommend: Sell your stocks, get them back when they have dropped, don‘t wait and just watch your losses accumulate ...
1805 2018-12-24 18:16:20 “worse depression for stocks since the great depression” trump bro HOW 
1806 2018-12-24 18:16:10 Yup. I’ve been investigating for about 24 years now. I have never bothered timing the markets or individual stocks (except when it was my job as an analyst and I hated that short term crap). Just own leaders and hold long term!
1807 2018-12-24 18:15:53 POOR AMERICANS. You have achieved a BEAR MARKET in stocks. Something @BarackObama  did not "achieve". TRILLIONS of dollars of wealth destroyed.
1808 2018-12-24 18:15:42 Throw rotten fruit at criminals while stocks last.
1809 2018-12-24 18:15:39 stocks are falling harder than i fall for the salty smart boy with glasses trope in anime smh my head
1810 2018-12-24 18:15:34 Dow, stocks drop on Christmas Eve after weekend of Washington, D.C., turmoil   Merry Christmas from Donald Trump.
1811 2018-12-24 18:15:29 Some good stocks are being crushed and sold supposedly because of @realDonaldTrump use of Twitter? Hmm, okay, I’ll take the other side of the trade on a lot of these then!
1812 2018-12-24 18:15:27 You told me to buy brock osweiller stocks.......
1813 2018-12-24 18:15:23 i waiting on payday to buy stocks. this is awesome! #StockMarketNews
1814 2018-12-24 18:15:14 You Woulda Invested Your Money In Bitcoins Or Buy Stocks Yea I Just
1815 2018-12-24 18:14:40 If you ever wanted to invest in stocks the market is hitting its biggest lows in the past 2-3 years. Don’t let the drops fool you, name of the game is buy low and sell high, find you something that will persist through the trends and you’ll be fine
1816 2018-12-24 18:14:29 Middle class folks don’t short stocks. Generally, they have 401ks and stock in the company they work at.
1817 2018-12-24 18:14:20 Perhaps to short some stocks with a little market manipulation.
1818 2018-12-24 18:14:17 Because they understand the true price and the discount they are getting on everything besides stocks
Stocks at current prices could still be expensive 
You’ve been bearish- are you saying it’s time to buy ?
1819 2018-12-24 18:14:11 We are all getting a royal fucking from the idiot for Christmas. Stocks are in the toilet. The idiot is deliberately sinking this nation. He is following Putin's orders.
1820 2018-12-24 18:14:07 A “bear market” is when stocks see a 20 percent decline or more from a recent high — but they’re also marked by overall pessimism on Wall Street.
Since World War II, bear markets have lasted, on average, 13 months while stock markets tend to lose 30.4 percent of their value.
1821 2018-12-24 18:13:36 That's NOT how the Federal budget works. First and foremost, you're not 'saving' ANY money. Shutdowns are ludicrously expensive. See the stocks tanking? That's on you; you owned it - remember. Second, debts incurred mist be paid - including the salaries of our displaced workers.
1822 2018-12-24 18:13:35 stocks rise by 1%.
1823 2018-12-24 18:13:23 Who else can hear him say Fake News! The stocks are great! Up! And all because of me! A+ (The dummies would believe it too)
1824 2018-12-24 18:13:19 Santa abandons Wall Street as stocks suffer worst Christmas Eve losses in history
1825 2018-12-24 18:13:12 Local grocery store stocks it and you dont have to go far in to get to it but it was still bananas lol
1826 2018-12-24 18:13:11 You are 100% right to look at M2.  And what M2 tells you is that QE did not boost stocks.
1827 2018-12-24 18:12:42 I didn’t know stocks could plummet so fast in only half a day #MAGA #Potus #TiredOfWinning @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
1828 2018-12-24 18:12:30 YOUR REALLY REALLY SICK! 1ST OF ALL THE GOP IN THE SENATE WERE UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT YOU WERE GOING TO SIGN THE FUNDNG BILL UNTIL YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND THE DAY BEFORE THE SHUTDOWN WAS DUE TO COME! WITHDRAWL FROM SYRIA, AFGAN, LASHING OUT AT MATTIS, THE FED, CORKER, & STOCKS
1829 2018-12-24 18:12:28 That’s interesting. Everything online says you became famous for short selling penny stocks for 15 years and finally hit on one lmao. Nice job dude!!
1830 2018-12-24 18:12:28 I’ll buy some blood. What are some good stocks at a high discount? ;)
1831 2018-12-24 18:12:16 88% downside day. Only person buying stocks was Santa Claus. Going to put them in bad little girls and boys' stockings instead of coal.
1832 2018-12-24 18:12:14 Currently buying all the stocks I can 
1833 2018-12-24 18:12:12 @KeithMcCullough Doug kAss is actually on FBN this minute and he's buying stocks. Now I know we are nowhere near the end. He actually loves the banks here. Lol.
1834 2018-12-24 18:12:05 NEW YORK (AP) - Another dreadful day: Stocks close sharply lower after Trump again attacks Federal Reserve and its independence.
1835 2018-12-24 18:11:59 He's making stocks affordable for the lower class. He's the best 
1836 2018-12-24 18:11:58 That doesnt mean the market cant or wont crash, but the idea that QE ("more money in the system") boosted stocks for the last 10 years is simply wrong.
1837 2018-12-24 18:11:56 from stocks trillions going out if they go to gold silver cryptos bitcoinf for example will be 50k now but it is not
1838 2018-12-24 18:11:46 I think USA stocks are now down about ~$6.5 trillion.
1839 2018-12-24 18:11:42 The #DeepState in the form of #CareerPoliticians will happily crash the market, then lecture us on voting in an outsider that opposed them.

When it's lowest, then they'll pick up all the cheap stocks, and once we Deplorables are sidelined, then set conditions for them to grow.
1840 2018-12-24 18:11:42 and you love your film stocks dont you jason
1841 2018-12-24 18:11:34 Stocks dip, oil slips, and gold rockets up.  All good for the "short" people.
1842 2018-12-24 18:11:30 My head hurts, my nose is stuffy and I don’t want to do this workout. Also my stocks are getting jacked up 
1843 2018-12-24 18:11:14 look for big money to step up and buy stocks

1847 2018-12-24 18:10:53 love your page I dont trade futures as of yet but do trade stocks and love bookmap check out my page keep posting those shot look great
1848 2018-12-24 18:10:51 Suppose I’ll be my cheery self and note that awfully quickly stocks have drawn down more than half the average bear market drawdown (either 32% or 38%,:gotta check that).
1849 2018-12-24 18:10:43 Your awesome, I'm stuck in a few stocks but have plenty of dry powder.
Wish I had a crystal ball.

1852 2018-12-24 18:10:23 I think you are misunderstanding what value investing is. For people who don’t believe in get rick quick schemes like you promote. Actually studying a security and holding it long term. Who tf has the time to sit and flip stocks all day. Oh wait, that’s for job less lol.
1853 2018-12-24 18:10:19 Makes me wonder if ANYONE in his base even has stocks or 401k’s.  This is an #Outrage #TrumpCrash
1854 2018-12-24 18:10:18 Last year: everyone sold their #crypto to buy Christmas presents. 

This year: everyone took a huge loss on crypto and has resorted to selling their #stocks to buy Christmas presents.

Christmas is cruel to investors. Wonder what it’ll be next year 
1855 2018-12-24 18:09:55 Fed just raised interest rates, borrowing costs and lending returns were recalculated by individuals, banks, and businesses. Stocks traded on those calculations.

Now, Trump implying he may fire Fed chair and reverse rate change = uncertainty. Changes calculations, stocks weaker.
1856 2018-12-24 18:09:54 " Stocks Collapse As Dow Jones Heads For Worst Month In A Decade ". Treasury Consulting feels that, unfortunately, more correction is required. 2019 is going to a mixed  year!

1860 2018-12-24 18:09:13 Do you know what's happening around the world? Or is ur head so far up #Trump Trump Trump. The global markets are taking a hit, lots of people are selling stocks in Europe and US economy is doing well enough that the feds have to raise their rates to fight inflation.
1861 2018-12-24 18:08:54 DOW down another 300 points . . . . Winning in tRump world. None of his gullible deplorables own stocks.
1862 2018-12-24 18:08:50 Trump will probably say "You can thank me for giving you a good deal on stocks now. Merry Christmas!" haha
1863 2018-12-24 18:08:40 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS 
Hey Dopey-in-Chief 
You love to brag how fucking great you are when stocks are rising...but when the DOW is in the shitter, haven't heard you beaking off about that! You want to own it when stocks are high, your lardass has to own it when they tank!
1864 2018-12-24 18:08:36 Meanwhile they have dropped considerably and this is the worst Christmas Eve ever for STOCKS !! He is a maniac and needs to resign!! #TrumpCrash #TrumpResign

1868 2018-12-24 18:08:10 U.S. stocks sink 2.7% on the shortened Christmas Eve trading day, closing at their lowest level since April 2017 -- Bloomberg
1869 2018-12-24 18:08:05 I make a living showing people stocks that they may potentially decide to buy.
I'm saying don't buy stocks right now. Yes, they're cheap, but they'll get cheaper. Hold the line. Powder dry. Falling knife and all that.
#TradeWar #DementiaPresident #RussianAsset #CashUp
1870 2018-12-24 18:08:04 Dangerous game to trade large cap stocks at year-end.

Big portfolio mangers at @Fidelity @Vanguard_Group etc are rebalancing their portfolios to lock in gains so their annual bonus (paid next March) is safe.

Year-end volatility has almost nothing to do with fundamentals.
1871 2018-12-24 18:08:00 Good news is stocks can’t go down tomorrow. Unless you trade futures, then they can.
1872 2018-12-24 18:07:54 Maxamillion hitting 110 like it's nun. Wait til I finish up this car. New suspension And new rotors and calipers. Then new wheels & tires! And im keeping the stocks. Then get the leather inside done. Then a motor refresh. Gon be a brand new car by April. #YoureDoingGood
1873 2018-12-24 18:07:48 Poor people who are invested in the stocks with your reckless tweets.
1874 2018-12-24 18:07:34 At least my MJ stocks did fine today +5.3% gain. So some hope still lingers...
1875 2018-12-24 18:07:30 The #TrumpSlump is real Y'all

The stocks are tanking again today

We all knew this was going to happen

#TrumpResign

1876 2018-12-24 18:07:26 Worst Christmas Eve for stocks in history but at least it is legal to say “Merry Christmas” again!!! Thank you @realDonaldTrump
1877 2018-12-24 18:07:24 A temper tantrum over billions of OUR $ isn't a win-able fight @realDonaldTrump. Get your big boy pants on & suck it up. Your causing harm to almost everyone in the country with your rants.
Your base is leaving you & stocks are down 650 pts.
#GetOverIt
1878 2018-12-24 18:07:19 Please, Shut up. Whenever you twit about FED, Stocks go down.
1879 2018-12-24 18:07:12 But it is a good time to do some bargain shopping for stocks.
1880 2018-12-24 18:07:10 His is what happen Trump when you screw your friends they all sale the stocks
1881 2018-12-24 18:07:05 3 things are certain. Death, taxes, and a sell off of stocks between Thanksgiving and Christmas.
1882 2018-12-24 18:07:02 Actually can't believe you think stocks are gonna bloodbath in 2019 , they call you now certain bulls or bears for certain point of the market to get retail to fuck off while smart money buys
1883 2018-12-24 18:06:47 .@realDonaldTrump .@POTUS @stevenmnuchin1 .@WhiteHouse @MickMulvaneyOMB .@VP Advertising Mnuchin calls and *Trump tweeting about the Fed has experts saying those 2 things contributed to stocks tanking further. Trump saying publicly his Fed banking guy is 'a dummy' instilled fear
1884 2018-12-24 18:06:34 No you are an upper class black man with investment in profitable stocks.
1885 2018-12-24 18:06:31 The lower your stocks go the longer-term you become 
1886 2018-12-24 18:06:25 Yo idk what is going on lately but stocks are hitting some all time lows and I’m not happy about that

1895 2018-12-24 18:05:29 Stock Insanity...Dow down 650...never seen anything like this in the last 10 years..,.,trump claims stocks are is report card...how do you like him now?
1896 2018-12-24 18:05:12 while you're pouting "poor Donnie" the rest of us are watching the Dow crash -600 points to 21839. Some "stable genius" who knew everything about stocks! If we were supposed to thank you for our 401ks when it was 27000 points should we still be thanking you now?
1897 2018-12-24 18:05:11 Two things to keep in mind about Trump supporters and the economy.  Most don’t care about stocks. And most would do exactly what Trump is doing if they were in charge. Incompetence is something they identify with.
1898 2018-12-24 18:05:10 Wow, stocks down 653 points. I think they closed up for the day.
1899 2018-12-24 18:05:10 Area Bitcoin trader: wow, stocks are volatile, dude ...
1900 2018-12-24 18:05:10 Sounds like something I’d do.  I’m reading up on shorting stocks. How to do a Put.  So I assume as soon as I buy my first put we will rally.
1901 2018-12-24 18:04:59 Stocks close sharply lower after Trump again attacks Federal Reserve and its independence. (@AP)
1902 2018-12-24 18:04:50 I also wonder if Trump and its family are shorting stocks. I believe Mnuchin is a POS as well. The worse the stock market does, the better their portfolios do. Besides, Mnuchin likes seeing people underwater more than anyone.
1903 2018-12-24 18:04:48 Stocks down 651 points. Protection my ass.
1904 2018-12-24 18:04:45 #Stockmarket was close to stabilizing today until I tweet-blamed the Chair of the Fed & stocks COLLAPSED!
Thinks he’s supposed to be more loyal to the COUNTRY than to ME!
I keep appointing the BEST people & then have to FIRE them when they turn into total LOSERS!
Thanks #Obama!
1905 2018-12-24 18:04:31 If you look at stocks, Trump definitely failing in his mission of Make Christmas Great Again
1906 2018-12-24 18:04:27 Good enough.  One more bounce to the mid 240's, followed by the final capitulation.

Still waiting for a sale on stocks but getting closer.
1910 2018-12-24 18:04:10 The markets are falling harder and harder the wealthy are getting richer at our expense and they are blaming Trump. They were looking for an excuse and someone to blame “don’t buy it” more money to be made shorting stocks “bears and bulls” are the same sorry ass people

1915 2018-12-24 18:04:00 Christmas shopping these stocks 
1916 2018-12-24 18:03:56 What stocks did you trade today? Long short?
1917 2018-12-24 18:03:53 @realDonaldTrump will you please shut your phone off, get off Twitter. Stocks were down 518 now since your Tweets 639 points that's a whopping 131 points in minutes, all because of your stupid self serving lies. The whole world Knows better then the crap you are tweeting
1918 2018-12-24 18:03:52 Mr Graham: Why don’t you get your info straight from President Trump instead of so called experts that want to keep our war based economy? That is why DOW is down. Billions of $ will be lost in LUCTATIVE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS TO SUPPORT WARS! War based economy! You have stocks?
1919 2018-12-24 18:03:35 U.S. STOCKS SINK; S&P 500 DROPS 2.7% TO LOWEST SINCE APRIL 2017... Merry Christmas
1920 2018-12-24 18:03:30 @realDonaldTrump don't blame the Fed for this slide that would be Mnuchin! Stocks now close to where they were when Obama left office.  How are those corporate tax cuts working for you?
1921 2018-12-24 18:03:21 Could be worst December on Wall Street since The Great Depression || (AP) -- Another dreadful day: Stocks close sharply lower after Trump again attacks Federal Reserve and its independence.
1922 2018-12-24 18:03:19 @POTUS @PressSec @FoxNews @foxandfriends @GOP @stevenmnuchin1 @HouseGOP  This being the worst Christmas Eve trading day EVER, it will be the perfect time for you, Scrooge, to be visited by the ghosts of my 401ks, IRAs and stocks — past, present and future.
1923 2018-12-24 18:03:16 Umm...you should have your money in cash by now. We've been needing for this to happen. Didn't take a rocket scientist to see that stocks were way overvalued.
1924 2018-12-24 18:03:10 @GOP The stocks tumbled 600 points today. Tax cuts not working!!!!
1925 2018-12-24 18:03:00 My stocks closed up for the day! Looking forward to Wednesday!

1927 2018-12-24 18:02:57 Stocks close almost 3% down because @realDonaldTrump told @stevenmnuchin1 to call the banks on a Sunday during a government shutdown to try an calm the market.
1928 2018-12-24 18:02:55 Worst Christmas Eve performance for stocks ever. S&P officially closes in bear market
1929 2018-12-24 18:02:48 U.S. Stocks Continue to Slump Ahead of Christmas Holiday
1930 2018-12-24 18:02:44 Stocks had another day of big losses. The Treasury secretary’s push to calm the markets, and a new Trump tweet criticizing the Fed, didn’t help. -- NYTimes
1931 2018-12-24 18:02:40 A fabulous Christmas Eve. Bought stocks all day long. Can they go lower ? Of course, but when the market pops, I'll be saying Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee !! Scaling in at many different levels. Santa delivered in a HUGE way IMO.

1936 2018-12-24 18:02:14 Definitely- most ppl don’t have stocks or 401K
1937 2018-12-24 18:02:14 You should have sold all your stocks and went short. David Tepper started buying today. I'm hoping today was a bit of capitulation and tax loss selling. We need some good news to turn things around. China would be a good start.
1938 2018-12-24 18:02:09 Stocks close with sharp losses, Dow -650 points.
1939 2018-12-24 18:02:07 @realDonaldTrump Stocks tanked. WAY TO GO. Just shut up about it.
1940 2018-12-24 18:02:07 To all who are using valuation to find a level to buy stocks:

ROTFL
1941 2018-12-24 18:02:06 Nothing but coal for investors as Santa Claus Rally takes a year off. US stocks down >2% on soft volume as investors just back away. All news sounds negative; pessimism rules the day. But that may be where you'll find the seeds of the next rally.
1942 2018-12-24 18:02:03 Of course stocks will rise again.  Stocks go up and stocks go down.  The question is why does Trump get the credit when it goes up but not the blame when it goes down?  His trade war is a disaster

1956 2018-12-24 18:01:11 Yup. Stocks and bonds getting slammed today. They knew this would happen. Thats why Mnuchin met with all the central banks to try to assure investors that there is plenty of liquidity. Every attempt to prop the market up uis failing. Loosing 4-600 a day
1957 2018-12-24 18:01:09 The Plunge Prevention Team is shorting stocks.
1958 2018-12-24 18:01:08 i'd like to see if Trump and Mnuchin have friends that have been "shorting" stocks here recently?????
1959 2018-12-24 18:01:06 you mean every time the fed adds interest the dow and stocks take a tumble. This time it cost 1/2 trillion after the increase. The most increases in 2 years. Globalist liberal fed chairman is against this country doing better. Cussing means your getting desperate

1981 2018-12-24 17:59:12 Not worried. You just helped me own 15% more stocks, for free, plus growth on all that when it recovers.

1983 2018-12-24 17:59:01 Stocks weren't supposed to. Need a positively divergent "lower low" first. Oil just following them down it seems. Prior low of 42.05 possible now.
1984 2018-12-24 17:58:55 December is typically a buoyant month for stocks.

1986 2018-12-24 17:58:47 US stock indices have fallen outside my technical parameters, but my statistical and fundamental indicators suggest stocks are heavily oversold. I suspect dip will be short-lived, but additional caution is still warranted at this time. More detailed analysis coming soon.
1987 2018-12-24 17:58:19 To create massive irrational fear to sour Christmas dinner, where the smartest person at the table has not held stocks over the last ten years, you needed a huge down day today, to help create sell orders for Wednesday.

2004 2018-12-24 17:55:18 Thanks to Trump and Feds stocks continue to get slammed. I’ve only lost about 125k and still owe over 100k in student loans. Living the dream!

2007 2018-12-24 17:55:11 The federal reserve is spraying the money with chemicals to make it smell like shit so none of the banks are taking it and it's making the stocks go down and everyone poor
2008 2018-12-24 17:55:10 Please explain why you think the Democrats are responsible for the market. Republicans hold all branches of government. Stocks have been going down since at least October 10.
2009 2018-12-24 17:55:05 Just looked at stocks again. Down about another $500 billion in value today.
2010 2018-12-24 17:55:01 IMO the world has changed.  The FED is actively telling people they will overhike into a recession.  However prices look to me in “risks” stocks priced for a bad recession.

2017 2018-12-24 17:54:09 Rule #1 in stocks: Buy low, sell high (this is when one should buy, in case that wasn’t clear).
2018 2018-12-24 17:54:04 Instead of buying stocks, you should be buying gold and silver. The debt market is a mess of monumental proportions. Also, on the technical side, all the markets are in the death cross. 50 day moving average crossed below 200 day moving average. Bear market.

2021 2018-12-24 17:53:45 True, that's why comparing currencies and stocks is a bad idea. But no one found a really good model yet to value crypto currencies....
2022 2018-12-24 17:53:43 Mr Trump your narcissism is destroying asset prices you alone created a belief that our economy and stocks could and would only go up !! You are causing margin related selling with no end in sight DO Something or this crash will be your legacy
2023 2018-12-24 17:53:41 These crooks part of admin. they are creating panic in the market and the  ordinary stupid people do not realize it they sell, then in a few months  when all  of theselling is exhausted & they bought all of the stocks then they put a statement out that everything isok and great.
2024 2018-12-24 17:53:23 New market lows!
Did Mnuchin say buy socks or buy stocks?
-- one PPT member to another
2025 2018-12-24 17:53:11 The short sellers and NEVERTRUMPERS ARE SO HAPPY. WAIT UNTIL THE CHINA DEAL DONE. THE ECONOMY IS FINE. 95% OF COMPANIES DONT HAVE STOCKS. The stock market is not the economy. You have been lied to for a decade. The economy was bad but the market was propped up be the fed.
2026 2018-12-24 17:53:09 Worst Christmas Eve ever for stocks! -#CNBC with Dow minus >550: another great achievement for Individual-1 to list on his brag sheet! #DonGone #Trump
2027 2018-12-24 17:53:06 Yes they do. I don't have Dads few stocks transferred to me yet, but that is what I would be doing.
2028 2018-12-24 17:52:51 Some days, it is hard to believe just how incredibly unfit you are. I think it's about time for you to sit back and let the professionals take over. The stocks are completely your fault.
2029 2018-12-24 17:52:36 Keep talking! It's helping! Keep going, stocks love it!
2030 2018-12-24 17:52:32 back in $IVITF for a scalp .76-.82 by end of week if pot stocks can rally
2031 2018-12-24 17:52:32 Oil stocks I though were interesting couple o month ago, are in "a temporary correction"(TM)
2032 2018-12-24 17:51:32 @realDonaldTrump Watching the stock market as I type, Mr. President.  Watching the headlines as I type.  Here's one that just went by: WORST XMAS EVE EVER FOR STOCKS.  How do you do it, Mr. President?  One record after another.
2033 2018-12-24 17:51:16 Times like this I really wish I knew more about shorting stocks

2035 2018-12-24 17:51:07 That is an interesting call. Have no use for your political snark, but you do have something to say about stocks.
2036 2018-12-24 17:50:55 Tech stocks are shedding moolah like there's no tomorrow
2037 2018-12-24 17:50:55 Afraid to even look at my stocks today. Thankful to be able to worry about something like that though, and to be young enough that they can bounce back over years to come. Many not as lucky as I am today.
2038 2018-12-24 17:50:23 Rather like putting innocent people in the modern form of the stocks but the infamy/notoriety doesn't stay local.
2039 2018-12-24 17:50:15 stocks doing down in the red kinda CRAZY
2040 2018-12-24 17:50:09 In a good "bull year" - 
  the stock market totally ignores a US Government Shutdown !

But these are different times. Will stocks take the US Government more seriously ?

#IGES #GeMaP #USA
2041 2018-12-24 17:50:07 “Individual 1” has managed to cause all major stocks to spiral down except one...Barak Obama’s stock is skyrocketing.
2042 2018-12-24 17:50:07 In this case he is talking about stocks but he is correct, its not the same as crypto, its not like a do the opposite thing with stocks, they tend to be fairly accurate
2043 2018-12-24 17:49:53 2,354 made 52-week lows today and 47-stocks made 52-weeks high.  that's staggering 1:50 ratio.  Good luck investing in this market.
2044 2018-12-24 17:49:49 Wait til stocks rise again. It’ll be Obama’s economy again right?
2045 2018-12-24 17:49:39 Good lord my stocks are getting killed.
2046 2018-12-24 17:49:39 yo...45 has given Americans an awesome opportunity to buy stocks...
2047 2018-12-24 17:49:32 why try and stop him, unless your heavily invested in stocks, let him crater the markets and get impeached.

#TrumpShutdown
2048 2018-12-24 17:49:27 I highly doubt “idiot” was necessary. Those crumbs and slices made my $400 into $11,000 in less than 6 months. Guess ya gotta know how & when to invest. I’ve watched people turn into millionaires overnight with MJ stocks. So, who is the idiot?
2049 2018-12-24 17:49:24 Govt can ask people to buy oil stocks instead of Petrol and Diesel. OMC stocks are falling better than their products compared to Crude fall.
2050 2018-12-24 17:49:10 So what are those trump lovers will say? They always say stocks up since trump elected! Maga! etc
2051 2018-12-24 17:48:38 It could be that the markets would do this with normal volume but it is risky to read too much into a low volume day. Also, the Dow is a lousy indicator of anything except the stocks that are in the Dow. Try the Russell 500.
2052 2018-12-24 17:48:30 Pay attention to what stocks his family and dummy corps shorted yesterday.
2053 2018-12-24 17:48:07 4. Loves to do stuff like go after Corbyn for attacking "bankers" as anti-semetic while filling her own world with greedy hook-nosed goblins hoarding vast stocks of gold.
5. She's WEIRD in Brit politics. Loves accusing people of "anglophobia" which isn't a thing.
2054 2018-12-24 17:48:03 Foreign money leaving the stock market because of an infantile President who makes major World changing decisions such as trade wars and foreign policy on impulse might have something to do with the market selloff don’t you think? #StockMarket

2055 2018-12-24 17:47:55 PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE! Think of someone but YOURSELF for ONCE IN YOUR LIFE!!! Go spend today and tomorrow with your family. REMEMBER THEM???Or don’t they want your crazy “self” around anymore than the rest of us?!?!?!Go and enjoy watching the stocks FALL!! ALL BECAUSE IF YOU!!
2056 2018-12-24 17:47:51 I lost 51USD in stocks Trump I hope you die alone like the sad ugly man you are
2057 2018-12-24 17:47:50 It's a myth that all his base is poor and live in trailers. We should stop thinking in binary stereotypes. His most ardent supporters are filthy rich
@GOP 
And right now their stocks are crashing.
Millions of $$$ are lost.
Phones explode with angry comments.
2058 2018-12-24 17:47:45 Crazy thing is how this is actually way better value than other tech stocks. Revenue for one quarter is the market cap, and they are ACTUALLY making a profit in the end.
2059 2018-12-24 17:47:40 #what goes around comes around #DJIA #2018 #stocks #investment #bond #traders knew it all 
2060 2018-12-24 17:47:34 Obama handed Trump a healthy economy and Trump took all the credit himself. Now that stocks are tanking because of Trump's antics, he blames everyone else. Typical Trump.
2061 2018-12-24 17:47:24 Stocks dumping, crypto pumping! #trading #crypto #ethereum #bitcoin
2062 2018-12-24 17:47:12 @fundstrat just admit u have no idea what your talking about. called a bull run in stocks. u cant blame the fed for this. end of a 10 yr bull run and record debt.
2063 2018-12-24 17:47:05 Worst December for stocks since the Great Depression. Where are your tweets now admiral blowhard?  @realDonaldTrump
2064 2018-12-24 17:46:54 Has anyone notice how stocks did not plunge until the Dems won control of the House?
2065 2018-12-24 17:46:54 WTF??  My home taxes are now over 26 k and my home value has sunk as a result.  My stocks are likely worth half of when Obama was in office. I am pushing 60 so don’t have luxury of waiting for market to improve.  You are running the economy into the ground fool!
2066 2018-12-24 17:46:47 You think stocks don't like @realDonaldTrump's Bull shit anymore?  Just wait until the Impeachment...
2067 2018-12-24 17:46:39 Except her party gave people the bump stocks to begin with. Guess her memory is slipping
2068 2018-12-24 17:45:54 Your whole job is to educate people who aren’t employed on how to scalp penny stocks. You literally teach the lazy, congrats.
2069 2018-12-24 17:45:47 For anyone else who might be reading this gibberish, this is not when you buy stocks. Buying stocks on the way down is foolhardy because you can never predict where the bottom is. Apple might seem like a great buy @ $147 but what happens if you buy there and I drops to $55?

Zen and the Art of Stocks.
2076 2018-12-24 17:44:41 Six stocks in the S&P 500 are above their 50-DMA.  Not Sixty but SIX.
2077 2018-12-24 17:44:27 In my opinion, stocks are up, up, up, baby!
2078 2018-12-24 17:43:38 How? When Bush left we were one step away from a full depression, now, after 2 years of Republican control of the legislature and executive, the stocks are tumbling and the government is shut down. Oh, compare federal indictments under Obama to TRump.
2079 2018-12-24 17:43:36 I am not here to say that the rumour is true. And yes people familiar with pot stocks and $APHA know not to trust these, but when an SP is moving 17% in midst of a broad market selloff, I want to dig deeper as to why this is the case.
2080 2018-12-24 17:43:09 How do you rebuild a sovereign nation that has a standing government?... So what you’re saying is you’re giving Eastern Syria to Saudi Arabia....I’m sure Iran is gonna love that... #2019 is definitely gonna be interesting... cash in your stocks if you haven’t already folks
2081 2018-12-24 17:43:04 Wife keeps lamenting the market's drop.  I cheer.  I went to cash and gold and plan to buy stocks in the near future.  I don't see it dropping much more than this based on P:E ratios and other valuation.
2082 2018-12-24 17:42:58 You should make your ramp tilt down until stocks bottom
2083 2018-12-24 17:42:55 Some stocks never give an opportunity to double down even if the market is in full blown crash mode.
2084 2018-12-24 17:42:54 But when stocks were going up, it was all you. Take credit when things good and blame when not.
2085 2018-12-24 17:42:54 @TraderLeibniz It’s something to hang your hat on I guess but yeah, to say these stocks have been a disaster this year is an understatement.
2086 2018-12-24 17:42:31 If you have student debt pay it now. Best time to put money into debt is when the stocks are down- use your investment money this month to pay off debts. Guaranteed win.
2087 2018-12-24 17:42:23 "Stocks had recovered late morning, but then fell to their lowest level for the day after Trump tweeted mid-morning, 'The only problem our economy has is the Fed'"
2088 2018-12-24 17:42:01 There are the poor and dumb, and then there are the rich who only care about paying as little taxes as possible. They and upper middle class own lots of stocks and more than half of that population voted for him.
2089 2018-12-24 17:41:16 Damn glad I’m not retiring and getting out of the market at the end of this month and feeling sorry for folks who are. Stocks are tanking like a dumpster fire. #StockMarket

2095 2018-12-24 17:40:37 @stevenmnuchin1 this is wosre than depression  most stocks down 60%
2096 2018-12-24 17:40:26 I was merely commenting on the irony of saying shorts are panicking on a day like today. Besides, you have to be high to say that trading has nothing to do with one of the hottest and most traded stocks out there. Not to mention a certain CEO who is seemingly obsessed with the SP
2097 2018-12-24 17:40:23 Most MAGA don't own any stocks.
2098 2018-12-24 17:40:00 Stack penny stocks boiiii. Gotta start somewhere

2103 2018-12-24 17:38:42 Hedge funds still remain NET SHORT in the VIX.  "All of those short volatility positions requires those who took them to sell stocks to try to minimize losses from being on the wrong side of the volatility trade." - Dan Norcini
2104 2018-12-24 17:38:14 The only one playing us is the baby in the WH that has done NOTHING for our economy (stocks dropping like a rock), domestic/foreign relations at an all time low. People not better off than 2 years ago. I’m done arguing with you “in denial” Trumplicans. Dumbest people I’ve met!
2105 2018-12-24 17:38:14 I think the point was saying "Look at this project down 95% its clearly a scam" isn't accurate unless you believe the same about tech stocks. Whether that makes sense is a diff qn. No mentions of returns in his tweets.
2106 2018-12-24 17:37:39 All of the above. However, if stupid and incompetent, he wouldn’t know what short selling stocks is (or how it works)
2107 2018-12-24 17:37:38 ‘‘Twas the night before Christmas and all thru the house not a Russian was slurring but a rat in our house The stocks were hung by the chimney to burn in our HOPE THAT ST MUELLER WOULD SOON BE RIGHT THERE

2116 2018-12-24 17:35:37 Hmm, considering that Bitcoin is down 80% from all-time-highs, investing in it now is more like buying tech stocks at rock-bottom prices AFTER the dot-com crash.

2120 2018-12-24 17:34:56 Econmics at its finest. Seeing the stocks down and thirst for progress makes this economy a evolved one. We need to start fresh.
2121 2018-12-24 17:34:49 Investors:
We are worried about the stability of corporate profits so we don't want to buy stocks.
Treasury Dept:
No, you should stop worrying about the stability of banks.
Investors: 
Uhhhh....
2122 2018-12-24 17:34:42 The Fake News is making you think America is going into another Depression.
"Worst December for stocks since 1931, mirrors Great Depression!"

They fail to mention that due to the historic rise in markets, this drop only sets us back to May 2017, which is not that bad at all.

2128 2018-12-24 17:33:11 He’s always calling for a collapse. That’s why he’s called the ‘bubble man’ I’ve been buying stocks today for the first time. Nibbling.

2135 2018-12-24 17:32:44 @realDonaldTrump I agree with you that the fed is why the stock market is falling but also ever since the libs got voted into the House is when the free fall of stocks started. The fake news lib media won’t report any of it. Sad!
2136 2018-12-24 17:32:39 You just know something huge is going to happen in the market on Wednesday and Canadians are going to get screwed again by being forced to twiddle their thumbs instead of being able to trade their stocks.
2137 2018-12-24 17:32:34 These were the same people throwing all their money into gold at the beginning of the Obama presidency. I threw all mine into stocks knowing they were cheap and the markets would bounce back. They did and they did way better than they have during Trump's presidency.

2143 2018-12-24 17:31:42 .@realDonaldTrump Everybody is worried about ISIS coming back. I, instead, worry about the imploding gay tobacco nazi aoles coming back (same thing). They're worse than vampires to stop! However, like gay tobacco stocks (MO, FB, CRM, TWTR), if they come back they will be weaker.
2144 2018-12-24 17:31:31 REIT also down so much. $vnq and $xlu acting like there is a bond mkt sell off and stocks are up 5%.
2145 2018-12-24 17:31:29 Stocks that are cheap can get cheaper..
2146 2018-12-24 17:31:16 No economic data to be released today.  Bond Markets close 11am PST today and closed tomorrow in observance for Christmas.  This week, most of the big Traders will be out, so Markets can be very choppy.  MBS will most likely follow Stocks this week.
2147 2018-12-24 17:31:07 Since Trump likes to take credit for the stock market, stocks are tumbling down again and we’re going to have the worst December since the GREAT DEPRESSION!

Guess Trump is making America the Great Depression again.
2148 2018-12-24 17:30:50 Or maybe no one wants to own stocks under an administration that can’t convince its own leadership they’re doing the right thing?
2149 2018-12-24 17:30:46 Stocks are down nearly 15% since the 2018 election where Democrats won the House.
2150 2018-12-24 17:30:36 As stock exchange prices went red
Economists everywhere said
The cause of the slump
Was fears about Trump, 
Who tried shifting blame to the Fed.

2151 2018-12-24 17:30:31 your the reason the stocks are down.  It means a weak president, remember?
2152 2018-12-24 17:30:21 Interesting Japanese stocks have been so weak, tracking US down pretty closely. Europe and especially EM have been strong in comparison. Maybe reflects ppl getting bullish on Japan in Sep when NKY had a false breakout (I was one of them fwiw).
2153 2018-12-24 17:30:19 Nike, Netflix, Ford, Starbucks, Amazon, Johnson&Johnson, Apple, Microsoft and GE are stocks I own and a few ETFs with gold, silver, cannabis and the likes. Any tips on stocks I should look into?
2154 2018-12-24 17:30:12 Stocks are having the worst December since the Great Depression.
2155 2018-12-24 17:30:08 Impeachment won't solve what's driving #stocks down - near-flat incomes, high percent of current working incomes nil.
Stocks have thus been a bubble for years.  And now, belatedly, institutional investors are realizing.

2158 2018-12-24 17:29:12 @Manisha3005 
Ever since retirement during April 2017 started investments in stocks & following CNBC & your report for the day starting with Thank you so much for that 
2159 2018-12-24 17:29:07 hi can someone teach me how to invest in stocks serious question thanks
2160 2018-12-24 17:28:59 There are quit many vacant single stocks in Osaka! although some developers constructed high rise residence.....
2161 2018-12-24 17:28:58 Tariffs raise prices for the consumer on imported goods. Many US companies make profits abroad that are being slashed. Ordinary people own their stocks and will spend less if their investments drop.
2162 2018-12-24 17:28:40 Celg has a strong pipeline . These bio smashed up stocks remind of the banks when all things where going to zero
2163 2018-12-24 17:28:38 My stocks are poopin' but my crypto is boomin'.
2164 2018-12-24 17:28:34 Any chance that someone can look into Trump’s investment portfolio to see if he and/or his associates have large shares of Boeing stocks?
2165 2018-12-24 17:27:25 starting to nibble very selectively in stocks--these are for long term accts like my retirement accounts and education accounts. $AAPL at 147.30; $MSFT 94.80; $MA 172.01; $SMG 58.0; $ROK 142.17; $GM 32.60  I AM BEING VERY SELECTIVE
2166 2018-12-24 17:27:04 @Activision you wonder why your stocks are falling, yet you are here killing not only your games but @Blizzard_Ent's too, Pumping out shitty games and not listening to your fans will be your downfall. Faster isn't better. Take the time and actually listen to your fans.
2167 2018-12-24 17:27:01 That #Santa rally is about as late as my holiday shopping.  #stockmarket #investors #stocks #finance #WallStreet
2168 2018-12-24 17:26:47 BINGO -- they don't get on Twitter showing how they are stopping the banks from crashing because there is really nothing to worry about, UNLESS YOU WANT PEOPLE TO START WITHDRAWING MONEY AND SELLING STOCKS TO CRASH THE SYSTEM
2169 2018-12-24 17:26:39 Did anyone notice that stocks began to drop just days after the liberal socialist democrat party took the house, just like @realDonaldTrump said would happen? Dems would sell their mother for power, they DO NOT CARE about WE THE PEOPLE only socialism and power. Food for thought
2170 2018-12-24 17:26:28 Whether the $APHA rumour is true or not. I wonder if it had anything to do with the pot stocks rally today. They all bounced in correlation this morning when the rumour was out
2171 2018-12-24 17:26:07 So when stocks go up, it’s proof that Trump “knows what he’s doing,” but when they go down, “it’s someone else’s fault.” Got it 
#NYSE #ShutdownStories
2172 2018-12-24 17:26:01 I just noticed, they are attacking those strong dow stocks like PG MRK MCD DIS KO. Nothing is safe anymore. Im going to scan for those strong stocks to short.
2173 2018-12-24 17:25:56 Maybe we do need a more jerky moves downwards in stocks if only to remind them that stocks going down is also a part of life. And that when things are really hit the fan, this is barely a whimper (2% on a down day you're freaking out, try 20% down on the open)
2174 2018-12-24 17:25:55 Stocks are going down worldwide because of conflicts that are coming and global economic slowdown caused by the conflicts and collapsing demographics of countries like Russia. USA will see stock loses but our economy is otherwise insulated. We won't see job losses like last time
2175 2018-12-24 17:25:54 If you’re not buying up stocks while their for the low right now you’re wylin’
2176 2018-12-24 17:25:53 Wrong @EliteConserv - stocks started tanking a month before mid terms,  right about the time that Trump's tariffs started to have a major impact on trade.  Not even a nice try.
2177 2018-12-24 17:25:44 I hope someone plans to look into whether Trump and/or family and friends buy up stocks just before he says or does something that sends the market back up...
2178 2018-12-24 17:25:26 Don't worry. In 2019 stocks will be the worst performing asset, and crypto the best again.
2179 2018-12-24 17:25:24 sold CBD stocks $pyx $nbev $apha holding cash right now but looking at $tsla and $eth and $btc - those 3 are my best bets over the next 30 days
2180 2018-12-24 17:24:56 When you need money in retirement, you might sell off shares of stock from your stock portfolio, but with dividend-paying stocks, you can collect income without having to sell any shares.

2182 2018-12-24 17:24:46 100% stocks was never for me either-two major declines in your investing life give you a good perspective on your risk tolerance
2183 2018-12-24 17:24:38 I’m new to Twitter. I think there are people out there that know a lot about the companies I trade. But I also think that some of the views on banking, stocks, the central banking are so wacky, that the only thing I can distill are people are pissed about the lack of economic opp
2184 2018-12-24 17:24:38 Stock market dealing with a host of political issues. Trump# rumors of his wanting to fire FED# chairman. Also, disarray in Trump administration and Brexit. But values starting to appear in stocks after 3 month sell off.
2185 2018-12-24 17:24:35 Talking to my 2 year old.
Me: Were down almost 20%, what stocks should we buy?
Son: Pirate stocks! 
Me: hmmmm
Son: Cannons

Signal or noise?
2186 2018-12-24 17:24:34 Lost over a thousand with stocks so far, but it's best to look at that on the same level as the money you could've made (just potential at most). Stock market is in a bear market as I predicted (can't go up forever), so I may get a job soon just to buy some big stocks for "cheap"
2187 2018-12-24 17:24:29 At the lows of the GFC only 1% of NYSE stocks were above their 200 day MAVG.    As of the close on Friday 11% are above their 200 day.  I have to believe it will hit single digits today.   #WOW
2188 2018-12-24 17:24:20 Is it ironic that I've had to loan thousands of dollars to Trump supporters because THEY voted for this incompetent loon and they would lose their shirts if they had to withdraw money from stocks now. 

If they don't pay me back I hope they at least vote responsibly next time.
2189 2018-12-24 17:24:20 “My portfolio is down 20% in 60 days”
“Here’s where people bought stocks in 1992!”
2190 2018-12-24 17:24:17 All stocks are down, this is nothing to do with Tesla's valuation it's fear due to the USA voting an idiot as their President
2191 2018-12-24 17:23:59 Banning bump stocks is the same as banning words and burning books.
Welcome to 1930s Germany, everyone and have a merry Christmas!
2192 2018-12-24 17:23:39 Mortgage Bonds give up gains. Stocks near session lows. 10-yr yield 2.77%.
2193 2018-12-24 17:23:35 Reminder: when the markets are down that means that stocks are discounted. Enjoy some Christmas specials and buy buy buy!
2194 2018-12-24 17:23:27 Stocks cutting losses.
2195 2018-12-24 17:23:23 Stocks are tulip bulb, buy bitcoin
2196 2018-12-24 17:23:21 What’s wrong with the stocks
2197 2018-12-24 17:23:09 Stocks open lower, Dow -122 points.
2198 2018-12-24 17:22:47 Mortgage Bonds open modestly higher Stocks continue their losing ways.
2199 2018-12-24 17:22:42 Bro I only been on stocks for about 2 months. An this would be how my shit go now
2200 2018-12-24 17:22:31 Buy bitcoin ! Stocks are falling
2201 2018-12-24 17:22:06 Fill 'er up Jimmy! === BULLSHIT. Trump owns this one. Energy stocks down from their ATH's: $DVN -54%  $APA -59%   $HAL -56%  $SLB -54%  $CVX -20%   $COG -24%  >>>DONALD TRUMP!<<<
2202 2018-12-24 17:21:55 I hate to wish bad fortune on anyone, but I hope everyone voted for him, kept their money in the most volatile stocks possible  I know I told then to stay in the market, & put their money where their mouth is...
2203 2018-12-24 17:21:33 He’s only losing money if he owns stocks.   

There are plenty of ways to make money as the market tanks.   

Is he smart enough to do this intentionally to make money?
2204 2018-12-24 17:21:23 Kinda sucks to know that I cut some stocks that went down only to put the money into even bigger losers. But $HEAR taught me that no matter how good a stock is, sentiment is everything, and if the majority is being irrational, it's going to affect you no matter what.
2205 2018-12-24 17:21:12 .023
2206 2018-12-24 17:21:01 unfortunately his followers dont own stocks lol
2207 2018-12-24 17:20:57 Well said Jim. 
Feel the market? The Fed is like a golfer?
What a brilliant understanding of economics.

I bet Trump just sent stocks down with that tweet
2208 2018-12-24 17:20:46 If I were Mr. Trump, I would buy stocks then sell late one somewhere Jan to March 2019.
2209 2018-12-24 17:20:28 With the artificle rates we HAD with Obama everything is different and stocks just showing what happen with election. I told mom to pull out and buy gold of silver. She was late and lost her savings thanks to socialist dems coming in and the waste in hearings of TRUMP... sad days

2211 2018-12-24 17:20:23 Finance twitter trying real hard to argue that the stock downturn isn't signalling a recession. It's not for now, but most economic gains in the last decade were based on inflated paper assets and shit wage growth. Aggregate demand isn't there to cover for falling stocks anymore
2212 2018-12-24 17:20:17 He was being sarcastic… there's more than 4000 stocks in the stock market. When @jfahmy speaks, people listen. Haha.

2217 2018-12-24 17:19:32 .0144
2218 2018-12-24 17:19:12 U.S. stocks fell to the lowest since May 2017 as American equities in almost a decade. Crude sank below $45 a barrel and the dollar tumbled. The S&P 500 slid for a 4th day, edging ever closer to a bear market after breaking below 2,400, while the Dow dropped more than 300 points.
2219 2018-12-24 17:19:04 I think Trump should tweet to his base to forget #GoFundMeTheWall, buy stocks with the money instead #LOL
2220 2018-12-24 17:18:56 Nothing puts me in the Christmas spirit like all of my 401k contributions for the year being wiped out by stocks crashing on Christmas Eve. Ho-ho-ho.

They also stated we were all going to die due to catastrophic Global Cooling.

Now? So much oil stocks hit the toilet and Man-made Climate Change (a.k.a. Global Warming) is undisputed fact.

And WE are belittled for doubting.
2224 2018-12-24 17:18:05 Well have you seen how the stock market plummets everytime the Fed raises interest rates? Are all of you too dumb to see that the strong economy was a boom for stocks but the Fed is doing all they can to destroy the wealth Trump created
2225 2018-12-24 17:17:58 The most disrespect president of all times. With no moral values. Oh and look the stocks is free falling while we gather we families!
2226 2018-12-24 17:17:50 How do we short stewie? Options put or use sell short while buying stocks?
2227 2018-12-24 17:17:46 If you think corporate money is worried about economy slow down, you're heavily misled. There is a reason the likes of Soros, Buffet and other big money have been getting into cash while telling people "not to worry". If you analyse who was buying stocks in 2009 you'd understand

2230 2018-12-24 17:17:29 Stocks down 450 so far.

2234 2018-12-24 17:16:49 Stocks are getting slammed today. That sucks.
2235 2018-12-24 17:16:40 There's going to be a lot of angry parents tomorrow at Christmas dinner when they ask their millennial children why the FANG stocks they recommended are imploding
2236 2018-12-24 17:16:32 What about the STOCKS ????
2237 2018-12-24 17:16:30 What is wrong with your sec. of the treasury? Thanks to his inappropriate and odd contact with bank CEO's stocks are dropping. Thanks a a lot. I get to watch my investments take a plunge. I am sure you put him up to it since he is another one of your "yes" men.
2238 2018-12-24 17:16:15 Why is the @GOP responsible for your investing failure? Why were your stocks going up anyway?
2239 2018-12-24 17:16:04 Obstructionist Dems are justly blamed for stocks crash
2240 2018-12-24 17:15:53 .0142
2241 2018-12-24 17:15:52 LOL so you think stocks are going down because Dems won the House? I say that only based on the logic of your Tweet, logic which is sorely, how does one say, "fucked."
2242 2018-12-24 17:15:40 Shit is down and still declining smh but I aint selling now to realize a loss. Mostly tech stocks + Nike + weed stocks. But nah no ETFs yet, just stocks. Ain’t transitioned to ETFs yet but def will in 2019. You on ETFs?
2243 2018-12-24 17:15:39 In 2008 the Dow fell from 13,400 down to 8,400, roughly -38% or 5000 points, in 2018 the Dow has fallen from 26,800 down to 22,000, roughly -18% or 4800 points. We’re halfway there. #DowJones #SPY #Stocks #MerryChristmas #Potstocks

2248 2018-12-24 17:14:58 Since Obama took credit for stocks going up, will he take credit for stocks going in the shitter? Since the Dow is getting close to 2016 levels, is it time for the FED to CUT interest rates? Just asking...
2249 2018-12-24 17:14:52 No wonder you have so many failed biz & bks. No such thing as a necessary trade war and when the dollar is too strong, we can't sell our goods overseas. You've also screamed about oil prices and wonder what happens when oil stocks tank. 3rd shutdown, 2 years. #TrumpResign
2250 2018-12-24 17:14:52 RT @maxkeiser: #Bitcoin, Gold up as $USD and stocks drop. Trillions in global wealth looking for safe havens like Bitcoin and Gold. If trend continues, new ATH for Bitcoin and Gold In play.
2251 2018-12-24 17:14:51 The best time to short retail stocks is right now. After Christmas no one has any free cash, everyone is paying off credit cards and no one makes any discretionary purchases. Only way retailers can sell anything is massive markdowns throw in bad weather and forget about it.
2252 2018-12-24 17:14:49 @IvankaTrump our stocks lost 60%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! just a few weeks!! WTF are you doing!!!???
2253 2018-12-24 17:14:35 Stocks fluctuate, a lot of factors come into play.
Demand for oil in India could drop, shiping companies with tankers would go down and the POTUS would take the blame because of a trade dispute.
My stocks are doing better since i stopped listening to people with blue checkmarks.
2254 2018-12-24 17:14:29 30% rally on $PIVX and other cryptos! santas rally came but not for stocks this year!

2256 2018-12-24 17:14:26 Wish we had a confidence vote like other countries. This way we cud force early elections for our fearless leader #stocks
2257 2018-12-24 17:14:14 Why can't Trumpers admit that they were suckered by a sucker? Trump is destroying the economic recovery that was put into action by President Obama. Stocks don't like what is being projected by the current administration. Zero leadership and stupidity equals disaster.
2258 2018-12-24 17:14:02 let's be real, if the PPT (Fed) wanted to really ramp stocks, they literally could very easily. 

reconsider your narrative.
2259 2018-12-24 17:13:55 Mike - If a company uses all the tax relief to buy back stocks &not for progressing forward, then yes, the tax break has cost companies good employees, through no fault of the employee.Again, why don't you have any compassion for those in my situation? Bc it's doesn't affect you?
2260 2018-12-24 17:13:52 Stocks go up when GOP come to power.  Stocks plummet when Dems come to power.
2261 2018-12-24 17:13:48 @federalreserve our stocks lost 60%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WTF are you doing there????
2262 2018-12-24 17:13:47 BULLSHIT. Trump owns this one. Energy stocks down from their ATH's: $DVN -54%  $APA -59%   $HAL -56%  $SLB -54%  $CVX -20%   $COG -24%  >>>DONALD TRUMP!<<<

2268 2018-12-24 17:12:41 Yes, the deep private sector is probably shorting stocks as we speak.
2269 2018-12-24 17:12:40 Speaks to the mystery of value investing...are value stocks a risk because they truly peak and hit hard times. Or do they have plenty of life left that’s misunderstood by broad investing audience that ironically minimizes the risk of “we’ve got to nail everything” growth stocks
2270 2018-12-24 17:12:38 Stocks are on pace for their worst December since the Great Depression. On Friday, the Dow ended its worst week since 2008. The Nasdaq is in a bear market. Via @CNN
2271 2018-12-24 17:12:27 By by stocks.
2272 2018-12-24 17:12:26 Not saying US market as a whole is cheap, just that some of the FANG stocks look okay now. On a selective, long term basis, I think there may be some stuff that is decent value.
2273 2018-12-24 17:12:23 @stevenmnuchin1 60% drop of our stocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  What a mess!

2275 2018-12-24 17:11:55 @realDonaldTrump worst week for stocks in a decade. That's 10 years in case you don't know what a decade is. We never experienced this during the Obama years. You are the worst president and you aren't even a real president just a fake. #ResignTrump
2276 2018-12-24 17:11:54 All this news about the Dow falling (again) has me fuming.

I know, I know—even owning stocks puts my family in a certain category, so please don’t mishear what I’m about to say...

This Dow dropping significant points has real repercussions immediately for lots of people...
2277 2018-12-24 17:11:46 To my knowledge there hasn’t been any change in gun rights in the US despite the egregious death toll by firearms which is why it keeps happening. A few states banned bump-stocks, that’s about it, and has nothing to do with any constitutional rights.

2280 2018-12-24 17:10:41 RE down, stocks down.  But on a positive note, we can now get 3% on a fixed term at the bank.
2281 2018-12-24 17:10:40 Nibbled Friday. Nibbling today. Will continue to nibble til the money runs out. If stocks keep dropping, that's when I start culling my current holdings and reinvesting into my strongest ideas.
2282 2018-12-24 17:10:25 like stocks, you are falling, genius
2283 2018-12-24 17:10:23 #stocks If this bear market follows the textbook, we can expect a sharp counter-trend rally.  This should occur when Wall Street gurudom stops calling for one.  The function of the counter-trend rally is to KEEP THE SUCKERS IN! Let the "creative destruction "accelerate!

2284 2018-12-24 17:10:13 Interest rates will soon bottom and move back up again, as stocks tank.
2285 2018-12-24 17:10:08 Maybe they just get people to short the stocks then share the profits.

2287 2018-12-24 17:09:55 @AskRobinhood Just upgraded to RH gold and it was all withheld because of a quick dip in the stock. I used my cash to invest in low volatility stocks and I'm above the mark again. Could we reinstate it so I can take advantage of this position using gold?
2288 2018-12-24 17:09:55 The collapse in stocks is the confirmation that investment strategy works! 

Useless consensus has no ability to read the markets and anticipate discontinuity, it simply follows the price and now they are utterly confused
2289 2018-12-24 17:09:54 Stocks are down nearly 2% again, at mid day. It's almost like Someone in charge is doing a terrible job at making a good economy. Maybe he should call that last guy. He seemed to do well for the Stock Market.

2293 2018-12-24 17:09:42 It’s times like these where sufficient liquidity is so critical, being able to buy these assets at depressed prices. Balance between cash and invested assets is prudent

2296 2018-12-24 17:09:06 We'll probably find out later that Mnuchin shorted a bunch of stocks before his comments caused the market to tank.
2297 2018-12-24 17:08:55 Anyone able to determine if Mnuchin, Trump, and/or their proxies are shorting financial stocks?

2302 2018-12-24 17:08:17 The stock market is a moratorium on @realDonaldTrump and his economic policy.  They are undermining confidence. Confidence is everything. The instability and mess at the White House is causing stocks to plunge.  They are undermining everything.

2306 2018-12-24 17:07:44 Gold futures are +14 today (+1.12%). Until that changes, stocks will have a hard time finding anything resembling a near-term bottom.
2307 2018-12-24 17:07:36 This sell off is becoming way over done.  We are reaching a blowoff point.  This is becoming a great buying op for some stocks.  This is hilarious to watch lol
2308 2018-12-24 17:07:33 Trump is saying that stocks dropping 3500 points due to his tariffs and trade wars is  FAKE NEWS.  Having Canadians arresting Meng as leverage to China and to ruin Canada's and China's relations is FAKE NEWS.

It doesn't help that every investing app out there defaults to showing today's performance. They should default to 5-years or so.

2326 2018-12-24 17:04:56 I think most of the hand-wringing around falling stocks is the same reason we see land price falls as "bad news" - it's mostly middle class media lamenting the loss of their free ride (which is paid for by "the rest")
2327 2018-12-24 17:04:55 Amazon Stocks dropped from $2,050 to $1,359 each, Facebook from $218 to $126 how sad

2329 2018-12-24 17:04:43 Stocks keep crashing, crypto keeps pumping.

2330 2018-12-24 17:04:25 Have to be honest I’m tempted to buy a few stocks rn.
2331 2018-12-24 17:04:03 There is no such thing as defensive stocks anymore
2332 2018-12-24 17:03:52 True, but this is just a correction, so unless they were cashing out their pension/401K/stocks/shares this year, they'll either benefit from the volatility if they have a good fund manager or will be more or less the same after the blip (like 2008).

S&P 500 slid for 4th day, edging ever closer to a bear market after breaking below 2400. Dow dropped more than 300 points. Trading in S&P 500 stocks was 40% above the 30-day average on a day that’s normally subdued ahead of the Christmas holiday. Per @business
2334 2018-12-24 17:03:08 Congratulations. In 2 short years Donald J Trump got rid of the Obama stock rally. Worst market performance since Great Depression. Now that’s Making America Great Again. The Trump Rally where stocks fall. Don’t worry Trump knows all. Lol
2335 2018-12-24 17:02:58 (12/24/2018) U.S. stocks hit 19 month low.
2336 2018-12-24 17:02:50 Good fundamentals in the economy strong employment low inflation plenty of liquidity thanks for the mainstream media the fed and electronic Trading we can't have machines trade stocks it's great for the markets not good for the average person's 401k
2337 2018-12-24 17:02:19 The power of compound interest is enticing. As rates are cyclical; a REIT buying cheap stock using dividends is good for lowering average dollar cost and creating an opportunity for long term growth. Mind you growth stocks are incredibly enticing as well. I plan on adding both :)
2338 2018-12-24 17:02:19 The problem with the economy is you.  You took credit for the rising stocks so I guess you own this too.  You are on video saying the government shutdown would be a Trump shutdown.
2339 2018-12-24 17:02:15 Surf's up, stocks down.
2340 2018-12-24 17:02:00 Have you actually paid any attention to anything in the last week or so?

2342 2018-12-24 17:01:47 Something bad,dangerous is getting ready to happen!! Please prepare!! I mean when Mattis is leaving,the government is shutting down,the stocks are crashing,we are pulling out of syria,and the Mnuchin says he is having a meeting with top 6  banks. Everyone please prepare!!!!
2343 2018-12-24 17:01:37 Once again, its not about stocks, your view is misinformed.  Its a financial system that is the basis of our economy and includes everything from credit cards to student loans. Higher interest rates translates into fewer jobs. Full stop, thats the truth. Educate yourself
2344 2018-12-24 17:01:34 We want stocks to be more affordable relative to income- not necessarily lower in price. 

Obviously, though, to the extent overvaluation is driven by government money-pumping; a correction should occur.
2345 2018-12-24 17:01:27 we threw Martha Stewart in prison just for KNOWING about stocks...

imagine if she'd been able to short and tank them.
2346 2018-12-24 17:01:15 Merry Christmas to everyone, except to all the anti Americans selling stocks they’ve been patriotically long for the last 10 years. @RudyHavenstein
2347 2018-12-24 17:01:09 You can’t even put out an article without a massive disclaimer at the bottom saying everything you write is likely BS. If you’re going to short stocks then cherry pick small flaws in a company maybe stop being a giant puss and stand behind your own research.
2348 2018-12-24 17:01:09 If you knew anything about the stock market you'd be buying stocks right now because they will go right back up shortly! Ble Pelosi and Schumer who swear they won't fund the wall which need.

2352 2018-12-24 17:00:52 Do we know whether or not anyone in the Trump family has been short selling stocks lately?
2353 2018-12-24 17:00:52 Stocks had recovered late morning, but then fell to their lowest level for the day after President Donald Trump tweeted mid-morning, "The only problem our economy has is the Fed." Investors are concerned that Trump will fire Fed chairman. Stop tweeting! ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩

2358 2018-12-24 17:00:33 Dear #MAGA and Working people -- your 401K is being RAIDED again -- those collapsing stocks will be bought back, CHEAP by the rich guys like Mnuchin who is IN CHARGE OF TANKING THE ECONOMY.

THEY WANT YOU BROKE and 'grateful' for scraps.
2359 2018-12-24 17:00:27 I‘m not claiming the stock market is relevant to job creation. But I‘m not so sure it‘s correct to say stock prices falling are „redistributive.“ A lot of pension funds hold a healthy amount of stocks.
2360 2018-12-24 17:00:21 All White House official probably already sold their holdings before the sell off. Trump said he wouldn’t invest way before and commerce secretary sold his stocks earlier this year I believe.
2361 2018-12-24 16:59:03 @RobinhoodApp, can you clarify this for me? If I get Gold Buying Power, and use $1,000 of it to buy stocks at the moment, how do I now not “owe”, or turn, these $1,000 of stocks into my own? If I deposit the same amount into my account, will this cover the money I used?
2362 2018-12-24 16:58:58 I don't trade stocks and shares but if I did, I would buy the weekly 200MA on the SP500 and DJI in expectance of a bounce on positive news in Jan 2019. Let's see what 2019 brings but it seems early for people to be predicting a recession or even depression.

less than 50% own any stocks and the top 10% owns 75% of them.

But sure “America” is doing great as long you ignore everyone under the median.

2383 2018-12-24 16:56:39 And cry all the way to bank while American taxpayers pick up the bill.
Declaring losses on tax returns cancels what is owed in taxes.  That's his MO.  In this version, he makes stocks fall, handicaps all competition, buys low, walks away wealthy.

2386 2018-12-24 16:56:14 Problem is that the corporate tax break lead to stock buy backs by companies thus artificially inflating stocks.

2407 2018-12-24 16:52:52 Shouldn't be in stocks this close to retirement ..Gotta be in income instruments
2408 2018-12-24 16:52:36 US stocks were rallying this morning and then Don tweeted about trade wars and the Fed and now we are plunging again.
2409 2018-12-24 16:52:28 Stocks have tanked since tRumps tax cut too.
2410 2018-12-24 16:52:25 Hey Don - Mnuchin spoke and the market plunged some more. Gov't shut down, plunging stocks, growing deficit, chaos among the ranks starting to sound like another one of your failed business ventures. Next impeachment and jail we hope.
2411 2018-12-24 16:52:24 You don't need to be invested in the stock market to feel the pain.  When stocks are doing bad, it means corporations are doing bad. When corporations are doing bad, they make sure their employees feel the brunt of it. Then the CEOs get bonuses for "surviving the crash".
2412 2018-12-24 16:52:19 In the interest of balance, Owen Smith offered free ice cream (while stocks lasted).
2413 2018-12-24 16:52:16 #Trump That thar plunge protection team doesn't appear to be doing that hot, does it?  Thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Mnuchin.  You guys sure know how to improve a situation, don't ya??
#stocks
2414 2018-12-24 16:52:12 Guarantee mnuchin and his pals placed short sale orders to make money off him tanking stocks on purpose. He is cashing in before leaving the country
2415 2018-12-24 16:51:52 Stocks will bounce back, they always do...
Just like the Trumps.

2418 2018-12-24 16:50:33 I would personally like to thank Trump for knowing that many Americans wanted to buy cheap stocks for Christmas. He knew that equities are owned by the coastal elites and now Tariff Man has gifted stocks at a steep discount to america and losses to the rich @ComfortablySmug
2419 2018-12-24 16:50:31 Hey #FuckingMoron, are you shorting stocks? Because you're comments are doing nothing but increasing anxiety and uncertainty, causing MASSIVE market losses--down 17% since last January. #YouSuckAtPresidenting #ITMFA
2420 2018-12-24 16:50:28 The same Fed pumped the economy to make it appear far better than it was. Now we are seeing price correction. Stocks probably need to lose 40 percent to correctly valued.
2421 2018-12-24 16:50:16 I’ll take that as a sign to buy undertaker stocks. #skeletoncrew
2422 2018-12-24 16:50:10 Stocks are at their this December average: down 500 points
2423 2018-12-24 16:49:53 Merry Christmas from Donald Trump:   19 month low for U.S. stocks!!!  How's that "winning" workin' out for y'all?
2424 2018-12-24 16:49:50 Isn't THAT the very reason DJT changed his policy on bump stocks?

The NRA won't have the cash for his 2020 run!

Just a thought... 
2425 2018-12-24 16:49:34 Stocks and oil are not rising?
2426 2018-12-24 16:49:26 I’m in “flyover country” and 45 is rapidly damaging our real estate market. Interest rates rising; stocks dropping; farmers struggling. I’m much more worried about Russia than I am China.

2430 2018-12-24 16:47:46 That happened to me TWICE under Bush. As soon as this idiot got elected, I moved my entire 401K out of stocks. I'm not making a whole lot - but I'm sure not losing!
2431 2018-12-24 16:47:44 @PeterSchiff now I do not know much about economics and wondering if you could explain the correlation between unemployment and the stock market. My train of thought has been if unemployment is low, stocks would be high or steady!

2437 2018-12-24 16:47:11 he will - his pals Odey and Marshall have already admitted they are shorting Sterling and UK stocks (Odey made £220M on referendum night) and JRM also wants to escape the tax avoidance clampdown ATAD - look them up

2442 2018-12-24 16:46:16 They gave everything to super rich they bought stocks. Now when it is tanking will sell and buy in bulk when very low. Name of the game GOP

2455 2018-12-24 16:44:04 Nope. I own some stocks, Bruno.

2472 2018-12-24 16:40:46 Halfway across the world and I can't escape my plunging stocks. But I'm gonna buy more still because that's what I do
2473 2018-12-24 16:40:42 If you're young and invest in your 401K, ride it out for when another president - more than likely a Democrat - repairs the economy. In the meantime, buy stocks that are experiencing a sell off. I'm looking at you HAL.
2474 2018-12-24 16:40:40 Ah right, even though the Fed is what got us out of the recession, they are the fools. Should we start buying stocks in MREs and survival equipment as you cause the economy to tank with your shoot first - maybe ask questions later trade policy?
2475 2018-12-24 16:40:25 not really been keeping up with it much, but whats the competitive rules for stocks in smash ultimate? Is it 2 like smash 4 or 4 like in melee, or even completely different lol
2476 2018-12-24 16:40:24 he is looking to escape the tax avoidance clampdown (ATAD) and make a fortune by shorting Sterling and UK stocks (as his pals Odey and Marshall are doing)

2479 2018-12-24 16:40:00 LOL, what stocks you own?
2480 2018-12-24 16:40:00 Their are several factors at this point. The fed rate hike, the fear of recession and oversold stocks are my prime reasonings
2481 2018-12-24 16:39:26 Seems that the idiot-in-chief is tweeting again to complain about the Fed. Further market declines coming. Can someone ou investigate whether Donald or his kids are shorting stocks in advance of these tweets?

2483 2018-12-24 16:39:15 Yeah, stocks are on sale for those deal grabbers.
2484 2018-12-24 16:39:12 President Trump you have Soros and friends selling off stocks to destroy you! He’s done it before in Europe! 
2485 2018-12-24 16:38:51 You forget the really stupid thing they did before that, in July 2008. Namely, the SEC put out a list of financial stocks that had to be “pre-borrowed” before they were shorted. The market immediately realized that these were the names that the regulators were most worried about.
2486 2018-12-24 16:38:43 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. 131
2487 2018-12-24 16:38:38 Great buying opportunity into stocks now
2488 2018-12-24 16:38:33 Don't worry. Most Americans don't even have stocks.  It's unlikely much of any of Trump's working class base does.
2489 2018-12-24 16:38:31 Cars, pizza, toys all have a PURPOSE. The only purpose of bump stocks is man children living out a Rambo fantasy or lunatics murdering dozens of people. “Freedom is a reason” = I can’t think of a real reason. Should I be allowed to assemble a nuclear arsenal because “freedom”?
2490 2018-12-24 16:38:31 The media needs things to be simple even if it’s not true - to the #MSM the Stock Market IS the economy. That’s not true, but don’t ever let the truth get in the way of a good story - and if the stocks are bad, then they’ll always say the economy is doomed. #ThinkForYourself

2496 2018-12-24 16:37:56 I don’t know if I told you all I spent this year mostly taking care of my kiddos and trading stocks in my ira. I wasn’t told about the final exam where markets crash whilst performing Santa duties 
2497 2018-12-24 16:37:49 Nor was anything extraordinary when stocks went straight up for 10 yrs....everything is fine
2498 2018-12-24 16:37:16 a lot of lies here - but I would point out that JRM is pushing leave for his own gain:1) to escape the tax avoidance clampdown (ATAD) and 2) so that he can make millions by shorting sterling and UK stocks, as Odey and Marshall admit doing
2499 2018-12-24 16:36:54 Intended so he or his crew can  take advantage of low value stocks?? Follow the $$ is my thought each and every time.
2500 2018-12-24 16:36:50 When investors see stock buybacks, it’s a sign that a company is undervalued, so they’re buying their stocks back. The companies weren’t undervalued and the investors buying stocks made the stocks go up beyond the companies values. And now there’s a sell off.
2501 2018-12-24 16:36:43 Stocks never took a beating like this under Obama.

2511 2018-12-24 16:35:38 It took Obama 8 years to raise thee stocks by 10,000 points since trump took to office it has raised 8,000 points and only started to drop after the fed ignored his plea to keep the rates low.
2512 2018-12-24 16:35:35 And stocks plummetted. You are POOR at your job like the rest of Donnies crew.
2513 2018-12-24 16:35:29 Ur tax cut for rich fueled inflation, ur misguided trade wars and Trump shutdown caused stocks to crash,All caused by you. You surround urself with criminals yes men and enablers. You are wrong on so many issues I have lost count.  And u wanna blame the Fed??

2534 2018-12-24 16:31:44 Let's go for a Christmas Eve/Xmas Eve 600-700 pt. loss in stocks. #MSNBC #MerryChristmas **cos the Evil Orange Queen In The WH CANNOT STFU** #USAUSAUSA!
2535 2018-12-24 16:31:42 You really DO want to #buy #USAluminum #stocks before the new year.  Several plants are near completion and will be producing by Feb.  
High quality #Americanmade #Aluminum ready for machining.

Let that sink in.

2536 2018-12-24 16:31:40 You can lead a horse to water Pat...let them keep chasing Penny stocks with zero edge while we collect pionts on these options...
2537 2018-12-24 16:31:37 Evidently there are no middle class citizens on the federal reserve board. Must be nice not to have any concerns over credit card rates or adjustable mortgage rates. Their primary interest seems to be on their own bank stocks.
2538 2018-12-24 16:31:26 I'm just quoting David Tepper. I own stocks and they are going down, but they've been going up for a long time too.
2539 2018-12-24 16:31:19 Bond yields are dropping, and the dollar is getting slaughtered right now. Is the plunge team going to show up earlier then usual. #dow #dowjones #stocks #bonds #FederalReserve
2540 2018-12-24 16:31:16 Wondering about the health of the Canadian oil and gas stock sector?Stocks have given back 15 years of returns in the past 3 1/2 years and are now back to October 2003 levels. #xeg #yyc #yeg #cdnecon #cdnpoli
2541 2018-12-24 16:30:54 Fuck all that designer shit imma start buying stocks
2542 2018-12-24 16:30:42 pod stocks rebounced today, dead cat? or reversal, no play until...
2543 2018-12-24 16:30:26 but you have been brainwashed by the Leave campaign - the reasons he is so keen to leave are 1) to escape the EU tax avoidance clampdown (ATAD) and 2) to make a fortune shorting Sterling and UK stocks (as Odey and Marshall are doing - look it up!) tha
2544 2018-12-24 16:30:17 @CallumBurroughs are you mental? Change your headline. SPX 2008 lows were in the 700s. "Alarmed traders are dumping stocks, sending the S&P 500 to 2008 lows"

2545 2018-12-24 16:29:58 @realDonaldTrump December 24, 2018 11:27 AM ET (BZ Newswire) -- Cannabis
Cannabis stocks were moving lower Monday morning after the Food and Drug Administration suggested hemp-derived cannabidiol, or CBD, is mostly illegal.
2546 2018-12-24 16:29:58 Yes AND they’re doing a fantastic job at making Boeing stocks tank this week.. Amazing these people can continue to get away with this ! #Mnuchin
2547 2018-12-24 16:29:56 What are the odds Mnuchin didn't short index stocks on Saturday?
2548 2018-12-24 16:29:51 Pot stocks green. Dad was right
2549 2018-12-24 16:29:47 Stocks still in free fall mode. How delicious! Looks like amatuer hour at the FER and US Treasury.
2550 2018-12-24 16:29:40 Stocks are in pace for their worst December since the Great Depression

How’s your 401K plan? 

I am 27 years old. Under President Obama’s economy I could have retired at 65

Under trump’s, I have to work until I am 125
2551 2018-12-24 16:29:35 YOU CANNOT EVEN GET WEED RIGHT 
December 24, 2018 11:27 AM ET (BZ Newswire) -- Cannabis

2552 2018-12-24 16:29:15 Let me go ahead and purchase some stocks for the week...
2553 2018-12-24 16:28:51 Great time to buy stocks Glen. Buy low, sell high.
2554 2018-12-24 16:28:31 Excellent result  Stocks are down sharply today, and those bank CEOs have no clue why you made the call. #DumbAsARock

2557 2018-12-24 16:28:00 stocks on sale yo lol
2558 2018-12-24 16:27:45 One of those stocks Ron Rivera?
2559 2018-12-24 16:27:40 Donald makes money when stocks go down....that is what he told us in one of his interviews before stealing the election.... #TrumpResign #TrumpShutdown
2560 2018-12-24 16:27:34 Say someone with no money invested in stocks...
2561 2018-12-24 16:27:01 A bear market in ES is roughly 2350 area 

Roughly the same price CNBC will tell you to sell your stocks
2562 2018-12-24 16:26:47 Twitter is a horrible format for a sustained argument, so either you are lazy or you think your readers are lazy

Economics is privileged because it EXPLICITLY is propaganda for the rich (or a grift on the rich, like technical analysis of stocks)
why do i have to explain this ?
2563 2018-12-24 16:26:43 “Stocks are on pace for the worst December since the Great Depression.” - @CNN 

Plus, the government is shutdown, again, (this time at Christmas) and our allies are concerned about our commitment to securing freedom in the world. #SyriaWithdrawal
@realDonaldTrump #TrumpResign
2564 2018-12-24 16:26:25 Dear @SEC_News, Don’t you want to investigate the stock market manipulation that is occurring with this administration? They drive stocks down with a single tweet. What are they buying? #MarketManipulation
2565 2018-12-24 16:26:10 Did it occur to you his buddies shorted the market and will be buying up cheap stocks?
2566 2018-12-24 16:26:07 Mnuchin makes baffling calls to Banks! Stocks fall.  Watch 'It's a Wonderful Life' to find out what happens next! #TrumpResign #MerryChristmasEve
2567 2018-12-24 16:25:55 Sauf qu'aujourd'hui nous ne sommes pas sur de l'export par opportunités en cas de stocks surabondants,mais dans un esprit "il faut miser sur l'export".En tout cas c'est le fil rouge que j'ai eu l'impression de lire dans les déclarations de beaucoup de décideurs cette année encore
2568 2018-12-24 16:25:52 Worked for me. Rode the sugar high of the stock buybacks and sold before stocks started heading south. Easiest prediction ever. Why would anyone in their right mind trust Trump with their money?
2569 2018-12-24 16:25:51 Bitcoin, Gold up as USD and stocks drop. Trillions in global wealth looking for safe havens like Bitcoin and Gold. If trend continues, new ATH for Bitcoin and Gold In play.
2570 2018-12-24 16:25:16 With the trade war, the value of these stocks is down too.
2571 2018-12-24 16:25:11 As stocks went south during the Obama years, Dave said nothing. #Agenda #Democrat
2572 2018-12-24 16:24:38 Hard to breathe deeply when my money is going bye bye, thank goodness I sold all except a handful of stocks when Trump took office but still...
2573 2018-12-24 16:24:29 Interesting.
Stocks are down 4500+ points and although I’m sure things will get a lot better in January they are on track to be less then they were before the beast was shorn in 2 years ago. 
Again: Wow down over 4500 points.
2574 2018-12-24 16:24:06 I am not happy that he DOW has dropped so much but it is not a complelte surprise to me. It went up so quuickly that most stocks were probably overpriced but I still like the high numbers!
2575 2018-12-24 16:23:52 Will Americans be brave enough( Land of the Braves ?) to follow your good Call ? ..If one Worker happens to own Stocks/401K, it should remind him of : “It is the Economy,Stupid>Trump
2576 2018-12-24 16:23:51 Yeah, it pretty much has. in terms of social media and stuff we haven't really moved on because a lot of it now is Fortnite or some other abstract thing. In terms of other stuff like illustration it's a lot different because you don't really rely on stocks.
2577 2018-12-24 16:23:46 I’m more into the lower risk stocks since I’ve keep a good green consistency, but for 2019 I’m going to start trying to scan and find ones that I can double my current daily gains hopefully
2578 2018-12-24 16:23:39 WHY IS IT THEY GET LIFETIME ENTITLEMENTS AS RYAN LIKES TO SAY AND HES RETIRING AT 48, UNLIKE WHAT HE WANTS US TO DO AT 70 ?WHY DID CONGRESS HAVE GOVERNMENT HEALTHCARE NOT OBAMACARE, A GUARANTEED   RETIREMENT PLAN NOT HAVING TO GAMBLE IN STOCKS IN 401K PLAN LIKE THEY MADE US DO ?
2579 2018-12-24 16:23:36 حتى ال var ضدنا
2580 2018-12-24 16:21:32 Yep... the old christmas pump and dump settin' up here... POT STOCKS... hehehe.... last year it was cryptos... oh where will they all be in a year?  
2581 2018-12-24 16:21:22 I mean, Cheetos stocks must be tanking now, right?
2582 2018-12-24 16:21:19 Hot blonde was the reason stocks went up
2583 2018-12-24 16:21:19 Our Federal is controlled by Dems Adm now/That's the reason why  our stocks are going down because they don't know what they doing/idiots voted more idiots Democrats in our gov last Nov 2017 Nov 2018/Shame on them playing political games
2584 2018-12-24 16:20:22 Trump, Mnuchin try to calm Wall Street amid shutdown, bumpy ride for stocks xxx They can't calm anything...if they really want to and mean it...RESIGN...you're the ones creating this mess you morons.
2585 2018-12-24 16:20:15 You take credit when the stocks are roaring but when it hits a ten year low you pass the blame? How stupid do you think we are?
2586 2018-12-24 16:20:02 Trump’s great economy:
Stocks are on pace for their worst December since the Great Depression. On Friday, the Dow ended its worst week since 2008. The Nasdaq is in a bear market.  Way to go - so successful @realDonaldTrump
2587 2018-12-24 16:19:44 Well @realDonaldTrump hope your happy with the treasury Dept head send big you stocks into a tailspin once again because of reckless and unwarranted attention. Mnuchin should be paying everything back from his trip to the Mexico of all places to conduct business. Traitors !
2588 2018-12-24 16:19:27 Steve Mnuchin is as big of a moron as #drumpf.  He looks like a goof ball too!  #stocks #Mnuchin
2589 2018-12-24 16:19:14 His family is probably short selling stocks.
2590 2018-12-24 16:19:03 @Varneyco Do you talk to retail investors? Most will tell you optimism in stocks lost due to fear of @GOPLeader not stopping Dems! Look at GOP track record! Money cost still low, 2% not stopping choices! Here in CA veh lic & taxes killing real estate! Dem rule killing market!
2591 2018-12-24 16:18:55 Stocks are on pace for their worst December since the Great Depression. On Friday, the Dow ended its worst week since 2008. The Nasdaq is in a bear market. #ResignTrump
2592 2018-12-24 16:18:46 And my stocks have felt it. Why raise the fed rate? Doesn’t the govt get enough of my tax dollars already?
2593 2018-12-24 16:18:43 So how are your stocks doing? Not so #HappyHolidays
2594 2018-12-24 16:18:38 All weed stocks jumped 2 hours ago.have a nice x mas meal
2595 2018-12-24 16:18:29 Trump and Fed.  Don't listen to politicians, activists, or trolls.  Trump is connecting crashing stocks higher and interest rates to the Fed. He is on their side fighting.  He will be effective again.
2596 2018-12-24 16:18:28 .@MOGOP4Liberty limit doesn't include bump stocks. There are already a ton of limits on guns that we don't make a case out of. Your open ended suggestion that some limitations should be supported means bump stock ban should be is the fallacy of argument to moderation.

#2a
2597 2018-12-24 16:18:18 LOL. Donald Trump,  current president, talking about stocks and golf in the same tweet. Two things most Americans can't relate to and have no vested interest in. Truly a man of the people.
2598 2018-12-24 16:18:10 seems that stocks are falling again - but Don Trump (the #liarinchief & #whitehousemoron) will probably tweet that the Dems are to blame
2599 2018-12-24 16:17:59 I have no idea why people are selling their stocks. Again.
2600 2018-12-24 16:17:54 The only problem that the economy has is the LOOSE CANNON in the White House. You are so fucking unpredictable and you won't listen to the experts so nobody has any faith. You're destroying the credibility of the US. Remember your poorly educated base can't afford to buy stocks!
2601 2018-12-24 16:17:45 IMHO The market positions today creates huge opportunity to buy your favorite tech stocks and hold them
2602 2018-12-24 16:17:32 And the idiot in Chief still wants to blow billions on building a frigging wall.

BBC: US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has made calls to the heads of the country's six largest banks, in an unusual move aimed at reassuring investors after big falls in US stocks.
2603 2018-12-24 16:17:20 Love the start to this Christmas Eve, the rents are yelling about stocks, I’m researching bowl games, we got so much riding with the game tonight and I’ve only been up for an hour lmao
2604 2018-12-24 16:17:20 Stocks go up and down all of the time or don't you know that
2605 2018-12-24 16:17:11 Interesting you hear nothing from POTUS about stocks and financial disaster he has created. He just keeps retweeting lies trying to deflect. SO SAD!!
2606 2018-12-24 16:17:10 To the 30k people who've like this so far: he's lying to you. Take it from someone whose country is also flushing itself down the pipes. We're laughing stocks.
2607 2018-12-24 16:17:06 I don’t know anything about stocks or the Market.  What I do know is EVERYONE involved in this shutdown are SUPPOSED to look after us! That being said COMPROMISE!  No more name calling etc!
2608 2018-12-24 16:16:44 #stockmarket has clearly hit the point of capitulation today as the algorithms finally hit defensives. Clearly panic selling at this stage. #Emergingmarket stocks continue strong outperformance. They led the downturn and first to recover. All actually great signs.
2609 2018-12-24 16:16:33 @realDonaldTrump Every day the market went up you took sole credit.  Any comments?  “U.S. stocks dropped in trading Monday, after a brutal week...The DJIA dropped 434 points on Monday, falling more than 2 percent. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index each slid more than 1.6%”
2610 2018-12-24 16:16:33 $PUMP at $12.34 Buy - Stock Market Alert sent at 11:01 AM ET to subscribers #stocks
2611 2018-12-24 16:16:28 Still at 35% Long Stocks and 65% Cash.  Hard holding the 35% Stocks Still.
2612 2018-12-24 16:16:03 Most of the US tech stocks, #fb #alphabet are in major support #NASDAQ and #dowjones are near major support. Let's see how the price action goes. Next few weeks are crucial for #StockMarket
2613 2018-12-24 16:15:45 Our economy American stocks shopping we are headed towards a recession Americas not as once was Americas not respected people are laughing at us.... has been this bad since World War II #TrumpChristmasShutdown #TrumpResigns #TrumpShutdown2018 #TrumpCrimeFamily
2614 2018-12-24 16:15:35 No; #stocks are collapsing due to "investing classes" belatedly realizing that years of soaring stocks while incomes near-flat and high percent of current working incomes nil was a bubble of same pattern housing bubble had.
2615 2018-12-24 16:15:23 You're right, it takes about a year for stocks to correct. Obama's policies were responsible for 1) guiding us out of Bush's recession in 2008; 2) providing slow, but steady, growth until 2018.  Now the market is suffering from Trump's irrational trade wars & shaky money policy.
2616 2018-12-24 16:15:19 @realDonaldTrump just wants to be able to say....he made the stocks go up again after he tanked them so bad. ( if they go back up )
we know his antics , hes like a nurse/doctor giving patient bad meds so they can revive them and claim to be a heo for bringing them back to life!
2617 2018-12-24 16:14:57 so why my stocks still dropping. You killin me bruh
2618 2018-12-24 16:14:39 Haha saying anything at this point will send stocks falling.
2619 2018-12-24 16:14:10 You already had your wish list price at 1646 before $AMZN.  How can you have more than 1 wish list price?  A formula for ruin unless unlimited $

Your 2 most bullish stocks were among top 5 worst performing stocks in the entire stock mkt last quarter $ROKU and $NVDA . Bullish

2621 2018-12-24 16:13:37 Dumps happening in stocks all day today 
2622 2018-12-24 16:13:21 Both @apple and @ATT stocks reached 52-week lows today.

Coincidence? I think not.
2623 2018-12-24 16:12:59 Stocks are on pace for the worst December since the Grest Depression- @cnn

Is @realDonaldTrump tweeting credit for this financial event not happening in many many years!!

#TrumpAdministration the corrupt administration of all times is crumbling as 2018 exits and 2019 comes in.
2624 2018-12-24 16:12:47 Le nombre de stocks maximum que tu m’enlèveras ce week end ?
2625 2018-12-24 16:12:34 Stocks fell after that tweet
2626 2018-12-24 16:11:56 I've been doing this same trick for 10 years.  I do add one twist. As things come down I also write PUT's for the stocks I want with strikes 10% to 25% out of the money.  This way if hit I get it at that price minus premium received. If not I keep 100% of the premium!
2627 2018-12-24 16:11:50 remember when stocks would rally when the trump did something dumb?
2628 2018-12-24 16:11:49 Or stocks! Or speedway because if allowed it would have continued.
2629 2018-12-24 16:11:42 @CNBC Up next, we'll have the guy who ran JC Penney into the ground...

We'll get his thoughts on what stocks he sees making big moves in 2019...
2630 2018-12-24 16:11:29 If that is the only problem in our economy then pray tell, why haven’t your tax cuts to the wealthiest corps spurned a trickle down economics effect-because they invested in their stocks and their balance sheets.FED is figuring out how to fill the whole you created!!
2631 2018-12-24 16:11:24 Who are they clearing through?
How many people would see this?
Are they really picking specific stocks?
Why didn't short interest spike before this.
2632 2018-12-24 16:11:13 نقول هانت او توه الناس
2633 2018-12-24 16:11:05 Did he mention what stocks he's nibbling on?
2634 2018-12-24 16:11:04 My portfolio of cannabis stocks isn’t down 10% today. WHAT SORCERY IS THIS???!
2635 2018-12-24 16:10:46 “stocks are on pace for the worst december since the great depression”

wow, so this is what he meant by making us great again?
2636 2018-12-24 16:10:45 You tweet and stocks go down.  You need to stop.
2637 2018-12-24 16:10:33 Why are you putting bandaid shares on the mantle?? 
I’m hanging my stocks in care

@TCC_Grouchy @PolitiBunny @OrdyPackard @JoanneMason11 @flinnie
2638 2018-12-24 16:10:31 I hate Trump, but realistically he probably staved off a recession in 2016 through his tax bill, as bad as it was, because it allowed for companies to buy back stocks artificially propping up the market. 

Bull markets are cyclical and the one we were in from 2009 was already
2639 2018-12-24 16:10:25 $TGNA operates as a media company in the U.S., operating 47 television stations and 2 radio stations in 39 mkts.  Revenue growth>10% YTD, with EBIT margins ~28-29%.  Looking to expand its footprint, could be a takeout target sometime down the road. #media #stocks #valueinvesting
2640 2018-12-24 16:10:12 Not exactly sure of pct, but I read that somewhere 50-60% of SP stocks down over 30%  even though overall market down 18%
2641 2018-12-24 16:10:11 Did he mention what stocks he's nibbling on?
2642 2018-12-24 16:10:06 When i look at each and every stock ticker i have ever monitored, i see a bifurcated environment where half of the stocks in this group have not even climbed down to reasonable levels after parabolic run up of late and the other half of the stocks looks ready to be delisted.
2643 2018-12-24 16:09:47 YOU shut down the government. Congress knows it, the people know it and the whole world knows it. You are at fault for our economy, not the Fed. Funny how its all you when the stocks go up but then you point the blame somewhere else when it drops like a stone in the ocean
2644 2018-12-24 16:09:45 He and his cronies must have their eye on some stocks they want at a bargain basement price. Market manipulation at work.
2645 2018-12-24 16:09:18 dont know any of these newfangled ultra beets... a Purple ? Stocks and shares ? A fucking cloun? A god damn cloun?
2646 2018-12-24 16:09:14 Someone needs to investigate you and your friends to make sure you didn't start shorting stocks before causing the markets to tank with your comments and actions.
2647 2018-12-24 16:08:59 rising stocks mostly just benefit the wealthy, but largely relatively neutral for most people. Sudden drop in stocks results in rich people panicking, 'cutting costs', can result in closures and job losses if bad.
2648 2018-12-24 16:08:47 #littledimwitdonny takes credit when stocks closed high for 1 week but passes the buck when shit goes south. He has filed bankruptcy more times than he can count and is on target to do the same with our country which doesn't bother him cause he works for a different government
2649 2018-12-24 16:08:16 Remember when trading stocks that macrocan sometimes affect prices
2650 2018-12-24 16:08:14 Oh, that certainly makes me feel better. I think I’ll go buy a bunch of stocks. Oh, wait, I’ve lost my retirement.
2651 2018-12-24 16:07:55 The only problem our markets have is you, #Individual1.  Stock market hates uncertainty.  Stocks fall during any shutdown and fall extra fast during #TrumpShutdown because you left Syria, then Mattis and McGurk quit and you want to fire the #FedChair

2655 2018-12-24 16:07:18 Meanwhile, back at the ranch...Stocks are on pace for their worst December since the Great Depression.

Way to go President Trump.  In your book, wouldn't that be going from Hero to Zero?  Its spelled  P r e s i d e n t i a l   F a i l u r e
2656 2018-12-24 16:07:15 Nope...holding tight. Waiting for buy signal on some stocks.
2657 2018-12-24 16:07:14 Is it really a cardinal sin? The arguments about stocks being better than bonds/cash from three months ago are still true (as of that time) despite the sell off. You can always sell your least promising idea for better ones even if it’s down. Just compare opportunity costs.
2658 2018-12-24 16:07:14 While the stocks are bigly tanking
And the president is Twitter wanking
Now his wall’s a big fat “no”
Trump must go, Trump must go, Trump must go

2661 2018-12-24 16:06:54 Big question:  Will large institutions delay rebalancing in January?  A normal rebalance will mean a great deal of pressure pushing stocks up.  But, if they delay, waiting for markets to go flat or rising, stock will decline to SP500 2200
2662 2018-12-24 16:06:48 Can the airline bundle it into securities? This sounds like a better bet than stocks right now.
2663 2018-12-24 16:06:46 Stocks are on the pace for the worst December since the Great Depression. Happy New Year!!

2668 2018-12-24 16:06:10 Don’t panic and pull your money out of the stocks just because they’re going down. Unless you’re like 90yrs old or about to die soon. Let the market correct itself, be patient. #StockMarket
2669 2018-12-24 16:06:08 WHATEVER YOU DO... DO NOT... I REPEAT.. DO NOT LOOK AT YOUE STOCKS... ITS SAD.
2670 2018-12-24 16:05:51 Blue Horseshoe loves Bank Stocks 1st Quarter 2019......pass it along.......and so does Trump, Inc.......paying down its debt to China and moving into Russian lending.
2671 2018-12-24 16:05:32 I should just bail@on stocks  today before I lose all my retirement to the greedy wall-street puppet masters. 40,000 just #POOF!  Are you gonna bail us out or help the ones that got 6 figure bonus checks for Xmas bonus ?
2672 2018-12-24 16:05:28 It's an error on the Federal Reserve's part. A lot of people do not understand stocks well enough to interpret conversion of crypto. Give crypto a chance!
2673 2018-12-24 16:05:20 When safe haven stocks like $T and $KO begin to roll over it’s a terrible sign of things to come. There is no bottom in this slide without Donald Trump being removed from office.
2674 2018-12-24 16:04:41 No; #stocks are sliding because the "investing classes" belatedly realized stocks soaring while incomes near flat and high percent of incomes nil is the housing bubble repeated.

2676 2018-12-24 16:04:18 Who really cares about the market? Are you investing? I can’t afford stocks and bonds!
2677 2018-12-24 16:04:17 And the people are the ones running and dumping there stocks. That’s the people. Oh I’m going golfing later are you
2678 2018-12-24 16:03:53 Corporate America debt is at a all time high. They hold 2 trillion dollars in junk bonds. Blue Chip Stocks inc. fired more workers than they have hired in 2018. You’re mad because increased interest means you’re paying more to service you 309 million debt. It’s about you not U.S.
2679 2018-12-24 16:03:47 I thought that for some time. The only people who can actually make money from a down market are the ones who have the capital to go in and buy up stocks when they are down. In '08 people who had money to buy up distressed properties eventually made bank because of it.
2680 2018-12-24 16:03:20 People sell stocks before Christmas. They're like "Oh shit, I gotta get out of here while I can still afford a GI Joe with kung-fu grip."
2681 2018-12-24 16:03:04 Are SAAS stocks the new FANG going forward?
2682 2018-12-24 16:03:03 Ah oui, mais faut respecter un peu. Genre ma GM faisait des stocks en tout genre et je pense qu’avoir traversé l’Allemagne à pied + la seconde guerre mondiale a pas aidé ;-)
2683 2018-12-24 16:02:54 If I was an (average) American citizen who didn't own stocks I'd want cheaper stuff.
2684 2018-12-24 16:02:49 You are the one that doesn't understand. How many stocks have hit 52 week lows since you started your trade wars. You don't understand this is a global economy and we are seeing the repercussions of your policies. Americans are starting to suffer.
2685 2018-12-24 16:02:48 ....says the king of bancruptcy, Russian collusion, lying, taking credit when stocks were high and blaming when low.  I hold you accountable for the peril in which you have placed this country #TrumpCrimeFamily #ResignTrump #ResignNow
2686 2018-12-24 16:02:48 NY(CNN Business)-The Dow fell below 22,000on Monday as Treasury S.Mnuchin's attempts to calm investors backfired.Stocks are on pace for their worst December since the Great Depression.On Friday, the Dow ended its worst week since 2008. The Nasdaq is in a bear market.Ağla Trump
2687 2018-12-24 16:02:42 The Fed now has LOTS of ammunition to cut rates and bolster the economy in 2020 for your re-election if need-be. Powell is taking early pain for your long term gain! He is right to burst the CA/NY/FL real estate bubbles. Valuations are extreme as WERE (key word is WERE) stocks.
2688 2018-12-24 16:02:31 Stocks often fall of their own weight. Never chase hot stocks.

2690 2018-12-24 16:02:14 @AOTtrades all the folks thinking of going long, please dont do that in bear markets prices can fall irrationally. We havent seen capitulation yet where you can buy stocks for long term portfolios. This is in no way a small correction we are very quickly going to head dwrd spiral
2691 2018-12-24 16:02:04 I sold a big chunk of my stocks a few months ago. Who in their right minds would trust Trump with their money?
2692 2018-12-24 16:01:48 Stocks are in pace for the worst December since the great depression. Thank you, @realDonaldTrump! This is 100% your doing. Great deal maker? You destroy everything you touch! Everything you touch turns to shit! RESIGN NOW
2693 2018-12-24 16:01:41 I’m a retail shmo.  Not wealthy.  I know NOTHING.  I’m buying.  This is simply a chance to lock on better returns come 2022-2025. The nice thing is amazing stocks are getting MAULED.  Right or wrong.  Incredible names are at what seems like incredible prices. Apple at 12.5 PE?

2696 2018-12-24 16:01:13 Your stocks anyway.
2697 2018-12-24 16:01:12 "December is typically a buoyant month for stocks. Yet both the Dow and S&P 500 are down more than 12 percent this month -- on track for their worst December performances since the Great Depression in 1931." -@CNBC
2698 2018-12-24 16:01:11 Energy not specifically. All the crypto companies don’t have their money in equities or stocks. They have already made (or should have if they were smart) most of the investment they need for the next few years. And tech won’t be rationed to the extent you infer.
2699 2018-12-24 16:01:00 We are likely just starting a multi-year bear market in stocks.

Long Crypto Short Banks (and equities)
2700 2018-12-24 16:00:33 When stocks drop even more its gonna be perfect to buy
2701 2018-12-24 16:00:31 But of course you will happily take ALL the credit when the markets are up. You're playing with people's lives so you and your family can scoop up stocks when they're at their lowest. Your blind followers don't see beyond your tweets and sound bytes, but the rest of us do!
2702 2018-12-24 16:00:06 US Dollar declining.  Foreign countries no longer view the USA dollar as a safe haven currency because of trump.  Good for gold and cryptocurrencies.  Bad for stocks.

2706 2018-12-24 15:59:15 All my coworkers talking about their bonus checks, but I took the stocks instead. Everyone out here playing checkers, IM PLAYING CHESS. I’m retiring at 30.
2707 2018-12-24 15:59:09 If you want stocks to continue to rise then drop rates and start injecting 40B air dollars a month into the system... like under Obama. Easy game with no consequences... right?
2708 2018-12-24 15:59:09 Exactly, and wait until the consumer confidence reports come out fully reflecting Christmas spending. No reason to panic or dump stocks.

2709 2018-12-24 15:59:07 Whys stocks and trading #cryptocurrency so cool? For me its because every other day I can check my portfolio to see if I'm richer.

This is why you want to talk about a wall. Why not brag about the great stock performance under your administration? I realize you can no longer take credit for Obama's work. Talk is cheap and that's all you have.
2714 2018-12-24 15:58:05 How many stocks did Mnuchin short before making this statement?
2715 2018-12-24 15:57:40 All 30 Dow stocks are below their 50-day moving average.
2716 2018-12-24 15:57:18 Fed raises rates yet yields are down, USD getting slammed, Stocks are tanking, and #crypto is FLYING!  Buy $BTC and $ETH and we can all celebrate the great wealth transfer soon enough!
2717 2018-12-24 15:57:11 Why are stocks this bad?
2718 2018-12-24 15:57:08 Fortunate to have sold a big chunk before stocks headed south. Actually made good money by assuming Trump is always lying.

2733 2018-12-24 15:54:03 When u lose trust in the system due to the erratic behavior of the @POTUS @realDonaldTrump you sell all your risk investments (stocks) and put it into risk free investments.

2740 2018-12-24 15:53:15 It just amazes me that every single patriot is not seething  about the markets being manipulated. IDGAF if you hold stocks, have a 401k, mutual funds or nothing at all. The amount of capital that Americans are losing every minute is damaging to our nation. STEP THE FUCK UP.
2741 2018-12-24 15:53:12 So basically Tepper is just as confused as everyone. Sells/buys/sells "Hedge funder David Tepper made plenty of news last week, saying the Fed "put" was dead, and that "cash" might be the place to be. CNBC this morning reports Tepper as saying he's "nibbling" on some stocks."

U.S. stocks fell sharply in early trading Monday, extending losses for the market after its worst week in more than seven years.
2752 2018-12-24 15:51:13 @IBKR has the worst order execution I have ever seen! Countless times I have not been filled despite bids at or above the ask or opening tick. Just spent an hour trying to explain this problem to a clueless chat representative. BS you don't sell/trade against our orders. #Stocks
2753 2018-12-24 15:51:09 If Tepper is "nibbling" at stocks this morning, I'd put money on him getting into $AAPL today. He's always liked the stock and been in on dips and sold some rips as well. At these levels, $AAPL a no-brainer.
2754 2018-12-24 15:51:04 Retail stocks inch up in the final shopping day before Christmas
2755 2018-12-24 15:50:52 The Netherlands will be at the low end of that graph!

Yes with @realDonaldTrump in the pay of the NRA it will certainly take time - it has taken him 14 months just to ban bump stocks...

We would love it if the top graph for gun deaths started to go down.

2763 2018-12-24 15:48:54 Can we not buy anything next year for Christmas?
Let's all remember that Christmas is not about capitalism and all about being Financially safe in a volatile economy.

Tis the season to save money, invest wisely, and sell off stagnant stocks.
2764 2018-12-24 15:48:51 Let's see if Tepper's nibbling is enough to boost the market here. Still some time left for stocks to recover, but the market closes at 1ET today so not THAT much time.

2780 2018-12-24 15:46:37 Massive corporate tax break leads to massive stock buy backs.  No suprise, largely predictable.  Bonus is that the money was spent on overly priced stocks whose value has evaporated.  Probably could have built a wall with all that money.

2782 2018-12-24 15:46:31 I dunno, those that are richer from the tax break are probably buying a lot of cheap stocks. When they finally throw Trump out and the market rebounds, they'll be even richer. Crazy like a fox?

2786 2018-12-24 15:46:09 The argument that the MAGAots make that it doesn’t matter if the market crashes because most Americans don’t own stocks is just as idiotic as the argument that syriza numbnuts made in 2015 that capital controls don’t matter because most Greeks don’t have cash in the bank

2796 2018-12-24 15:45:01 Thanks so much Jeff! Assuming U.S. stocks finish down for the year, the narrative that active outperforms in down markets would seem to take a hit.
2797 2018-12-24 15:44:44 Why because the stocks are tanking?  Thousands of citizens are going unpaid? Our president is going to be removed from office?  Oh wait you might have something with that last one.

2808 2018-12-24 15:42:28 We are oversold here in the US market. Still a dangerous environment as the selling appears to be mostly technical over the past few months. However, for us investors who have been defensively positioned in 2018, there are too many attractive bargains to ignore. Buying stocks now

2815 2018-12-24 15:41:37 BTW... #CNBC just announcing that #DavidTepper started nibbling at some stocks this morning at the lows -which are half of what they were an hour ago. So guessing if we go Green an mrkts start to rebound into year end, it will be called the #TepperPut. @carlquintanilla

2818 2018-12-24 15:41:13 And with stocks one must purchase a full stock, not a fraction (if buying directly). With crypto such as Bitcoin fractions are what most people can afford vs a full Bitcoin. Oh and #BTC can be purchased 24/7/365. 
2819 2018-12-24 15:41:09 I sold all my stocks back in August and bought an 18 month GIC.  Trump is President.   I knew he would tank the economy.  I just thought Mueller report would have been out by now.  Wait for the panic when everyone realizes he and the GOP are cooked.  This is nothing.
2820 2018-12-24 15:41:08 I missed buying stocks in 2009 and won't make that mistake again. Had a feeling in 2016 that Trump would crater the market and it's almost here. #trumpresign #resigntrump

2835 2018-12-24 15:39:56 

Obama convinced so many Americans that economic downturns are the end of all things as we know it.   Lower stock values also mean retail investors have an opportunity to purchase stocks w\actual high, long-term value.
2836 2018-12-24 15:39:51 $TWLO $SQ $GOOG are among the strongest stocks right now relative to $SPY and $QQQ. Big eye on them for when the market rallies in the coming days/weeks. Someone has been aggressively buying calls on them throughout this entire panic. Insane relative strength.

2866 2018-12-24 15:37:02 best use i've found of them is to set up trend trades. you can use them in counter-trend application (especially on stocks), but results in a much choppier equity curve. i've quantified a number of trend and pullback setups w/ channels. (see mod. 4 of my trading course)

2877 2018-12-24 15:35:49 There is continuing dwindling number of stocks that are traded of value in the markets, as the increasing pool money/funds chase up and over value those stocks. Thus  prices are artificially overvalued. @WSJ @Apple @nytimes #HGOHD #HARJGTWO #HWOWORLD
2878 2018-12-24 15:35:48 Yes another revenge of a spurned Trump. He takes bump stocks when fox News criticizes him and tanks the markets when congressional Republicans turn against him. What's next? He's a bad hombre. #ImpeachTrump

2880 2018-12-24 15:35:40 This sell off is a lot less scary than it looks both $GOOG and $FB trading up today - quality growth stocks will rally (yeah $FB not really quality but it’s been really hit)
2881 2018-12-24 15:35:37 The stocks began to dip as soon as the DemoRATS we're elected to the house!

2889 2018-12-24 15:34:34 Thanks, but we have a great team of advisors and bankers. We meet with them regularly, have a detailed plan, and we trust them. Took a huge % out of stocks last summer, put it into bonds, which are not doing great, but not as badly as stocks.

2892 2018-12-24 15:34:12 @realDonaldTrump  keep your team away from economy.  Stocks tumble every time your minions speak. If you remove Powell any perception that you are trying to control the markets will further aggravate the situation. That’s because it’s obviously you know nothing about economics.
2893 2018-12-24 15:33:52 But you need spare money to buy stocks. Who has spare money right now?
2894 2018-12-24 15:33:50 YOU talk about everyone else taking total advantage of the U.S. and our taxpayers what about you? You have taken more vacations (to your resorts) in only two years than President Obama did in 8 years, you are pressuring Mnuchin about Wall Street Stocks for your personal gain and
2895 2018-12-24 15:33:20 Turns out my initial reaction to sell all my stocks and mutual funds on the day after Trump was elected was right! (I ignored it).

2899 2018-12-24 15:33:07 I went last minute shopping today. Fewer shoppers than in previous years, though. This year has been bad. 15% VAT and poorly performing stocks on the JSE/a poorly performing economy. Let’s hope next year is better, though some are predicting a recession in the USA..

2906 2018-12-24 15:31:28 So melodramatic.  Overall the market has done well.   Sell-offs are needed.  Take the profit, drive the market further south, then buy.   

Most of the stocks were already overvalued.

2914 2018-12-24 15:29:25 How will you trade in these stocks if you are observing it on weekly charts ?

With future or options ?  Don't think stock option will be a good instrument to take in stock options as when will they fall only god knows ?

2916 2018-12-24 15:28:56 @wsj "Stocks Extend Fall Despite Mnuchin Bid to Reassure Investors" | We should all remember idiocy of Hank Paulson in 2008....  "Buying assets from $C" or "GSE to issue covered bonds...." @WilliamCohan @JamesGRickards
2917 2018-12-24 15:28:39 Congrats to @realDonaldTrump Stocks are on pace for their worst December since the Great Depression. On Friday, the Dow ended its worst week since 2008. The Nasdaq is in a bear market. Keep up the great deals your making
2918 2018-12-24 15:28:32 If i told you stocks are off 20%, how wide would you guess HY spreads moved?  certainly > +200bps.  So watch McConnell's support and Mueller report?
2919 2018-12-24 15:28:28 They EM have the softening of the weak dollar to boost the markets. This is a counter balance to the declines in US market. It will be interesting to see a possible case of long term Green markets in Asia and EM while US stocks continue decline to PRE-2016 levels . #rebalance
2920 2018-12-24 15:28:25 Dems won the House- stocks plummet. Don't get it twisted.
2921 2018-12-24 15:28:16 @realDonaldTrump resign now, so that we can stabilize the stocks and economy. You must be a sleeper agent sent on to disrupt and destabilize the US.
2922 2018-12-24 15:28:00 @CNBC @FoxBusiness @cvpayne @MariaBartiromo I’m done with stocks. At least I feel the crypto market has a chance. Never in my lifetime would I believe that even the business media refuses to cover and defend our @POTUS Go ahead @CNNBusiness I dare you to help @realDonaldTrump
2923 2018-12-24 15:27:59 Column in NY Times about drop in stocks today: one run-on sentence after another. One bizzare paragraph was composed of one sentence.
“The Newspaper of Record” had better hire copy editors  fired to save $.
2924 2018-12-24 15:27:33 This is undoubtedly so. But how many lower & middle class Americans actually play the stockmarket? Or is the effect one that reverberates down the line (stocks tumble, companies contract, workers laid off)?
2925 2018-12-24 15:27:21 Shit. Got the family stocks for Christmas.
2926 2018-12-24 15:27:20 Does the President know with weak economy why stocks go up? Wells Fargo lays-off and shifts jobs overseas. perhaps they can meddle with tax money and continue with the clandestine activities that they did in the US with multiplication of accounts.
2927 2018-12-24 15:26:47 We will be open on Boxing day from 10:00 until 12:00 for those needing to replenish the stocks...
2928 2018-12-24 15:26:40 @KennethLFisher I’m super bullish on stocks now. I’m a millennial who started investing in 2014. I feel like everything is on sale now. Unfortunately, all of my money is in the market so I can’t invest anymore money. I’m a contrarian and I feel good about the US Economy.
2929 2018-12-24 15:26:22 So stocks are on sale??
2930 2018-12-24 15:26:21 The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank Monday after the blue-chip index fell 6.9% last week, its worst week since 2008. The S&P 500 dropped 7.1% and the Nasdaq declined 8.4% and entered bear market territory.

Everyone in Fidelity moving their stocks to a stable fund.
2931 2018-12-24 15:26:07 Back to work after early Christmas vacation. Rough transition but I should get used to it, because after checking stocks it looks like I’ll be approximately 103 before I can retire.
2932 2018-12-24 15:25:57 73% of S&P 500 financial stocks hit a 52-week low this morning. That exceeds all days from the worldwide financial crisis.
2933 2018-12-24 15:25:50 No. Many stocks are cheap.
2934 2018-12-24 15:25:44 The S&P Index was started in 1923.

It became 500 stocks in 1957.
2935 2018-12-24 15:25:41 All my stocks down ..damn
2936 2018-12-24 15:25:32 It’s time for the 25th Amendment. You’re clearly unstable this morning as the stocks plunge even lower on day 3 of government shutdown. Merry Christmas, right?
2937 2018-12-24 15:25:24 And the stocks go down but the #cryptos rise. That is interesting. This december #crypto might have won the war with paper in some way but time will tell where this is leading to. #BTC #ETH #XVG #ADA #LTC.  Looks like #santa brought crypto as gifts
2938 2018-12-24 15:25:21 All stocks are on sale today Merry Xmas
2939 2018-12-24 15:25:17 @HillaryClinton This shut down effects the stock market in ways most dont see. People who aren't getting paid need money for Christmas so they will sell off their stocks not, everyone's rich. The middle class are working 2 and 3 jobs just to make ends meet.
Trump is so stupid!
2940 2018-12-24 15:25:17 Individual energy stocks now at Great Recession lows. $APA $DVN $SLB and there's more. Trump owns it.
2941 2018-12-24 15:25:01 They're doing a bang up job of scaring the markets out of stocks, regardless of fundamentals.
2942 2018-12-24 15:24:58 Wall Street stocks suffered worst week in a decade while crypto market cap grew by more than 40%. 

The trade of the decade?

Low correlation in crypto will help act as a macroeconomic hedge and the holy grail in portofolio diversification.

2944 2018-12-24 15:24:48 The root problem of the stockmarket. It has become a casino, nothing more. All stocks are taking a dive but #DeutscheBank up. Even though it is pretty much dead. Either the ECB are doing purchases to keep it afloat or investors taking a sure bet it will be bailed out. #sick
2945 2018-12-24 15:24:35 Folks coming back to their desks to see stocks down again thinking about some stupid comment that someone that knows nothin about stocks said over the weekend. End up selling stocks they have been patiently holding onto for months RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM-

Marine
2948 2018-12-24 15:24:28 Which brings me to the point - i believe it is a good time to start nibbling on good stocks.
2949 2018-12-24 15:24:27 That’s so interesting. They basically formed portfolios. 

We do it all the time in Finance. Stocks are so noisy any predictor will almost certainly have a low r-squared, but when you form say 10 portfolios on that predictors u see the economic significance
2950 2018-12-24 15:24:00 Total b/s. He liked to call out the ATHs but those calls had 0 to do with stocks. 

Tax Reform drove stocks
2951 2018-12-24 15:24:00 I got out of equities at 2300 and went to bonds because I kept reading articles that stocks were historically expensive and I could see we had an unstable idiot at the helm of the US economy.  I've been worried it was the wrong choice, but now I am feeling great! thanks santa!
2952 2018-12-24 15:23:47 Alarmed traders are dumping stocks, sending the S&P 500 to 2008 lows — while Mnuchin's odd attempt to soothe markets backfired

2959 2018-12-24 15:22:16 Makes sense but there's no way we can be 100% sure about that. 
In the midtime, some stocks that were overpriced now look a little bit more reasonable.

2963 2018-12-24 15:21:45 Someone tell me when the stock market is gonna go back up so I can buy up lots of stocks for cheap 
2964 2018-12-24 15:21:44 One of my stocks still up next week thinking bout getting some shares
2965 2018-12-24 15:21:42 10:20am 1,108 stocks are up from the open vs 2,007 that are down form the open. 21 stocks are down 4% or more vs 21 that are up 4% or more
2966 2018-12-24 15:21:34 Sessions and Huber did the job they were tasked to do.  New phase.  I see much progress, there are many Grand Juries empaneled, we’ll see the results.  I understand frustration but it took hundreds of years of corruption which will take time to undo.  It’ll happen.
2967 2018-12-24 15:21:28 Do you use Interactive brokers for buying or selling foreign stocks?
2968 2018-12-24 15:21:24 Why are stocks dropping?  What will the new House leaders do to create wealth and jobs?
2969 2018-12-24 15:21:11 Makes so much sense, because it only takes a few minutes to cash out stocks and buy gifts . #lastminuteshoppers 
2970 2018-12-24 15:21:11 Want to see the stocks rise 2,000 points in a day? One headline: Trump Resigns! BOOM!
2971 2018-12-24 15:20:40 Sell #stocks baby!  Burn it all down.  S&P 1200 before 2020.
2972 2018-12-24 15:20:29 When the market goes up, the rich profit from stocks.
When the market goes down, the rich buy stocks.
When the market crashes, the rich buy stocks very cheap.
What is happening right now is a feature, not a bug.
2973 2018-12-24 15:20:26 They need more tax cuts to buy more stocks to keep the bubble inflated because actual corporate profits require the working classes have disposible income.
2974 2018-12-24 15:20:18 I would not have more that 5% of portfolio in one stock
I am in about 50 stocks and only 14 in bio

2976 2018-12-24 15:20:17 #stocks Trump, who started latest slide with his foolish threat to fire the FED chair is now being mishandled by Mnuchin, whose clumsy attempt to restore confidence has already backfired.  Only point of today's meeting of Plunge protection team is to pressure the FED.  Will FAIL!
2977 2018-12-24 15:20:05 73% of S&P 500 financial stocks hit a 52-week low this morning. That exceeds all days from the worldwide financial crisis.

Since 1990, the only days to exceed today's reading were Sept 24 & 27, 1990.
2978 2018-12-24 15:19:54 Every three minutes, my Robinhood app is alerting me that my stocks are tumbling down. I am not amused by this shit at all.
2979 2018-12-24 15:19:37 Stocks open lower after Treasury secretary's call to bank CEOs
2980 2018-12-24 15:19:34 They are claiming the economy is strong, but I don't trust any of them as far as I can throw them. If you're close to retirement, consider moving out of stocks!
2981 2018-12-24 15:19:27 Stocks slide as Mnuchin's call with bank CEOs raises eyebrows   Treasury chief's statement on bank liquidity, intended to calm financial markets, could heighten market concerns   updated 1M ago
2982 2018-12-24 15:19:22 $spx $qqq $spy #stocks like “It’s a Wonderful Life”, you’re selling and Potter’s buying. Don’t panic! Better yet, move cash off the sidelines. This may be best buying opportunity since QE was announced.
2983 2018-12-24 15:19:04 @realDonaldTrump wants to run for a second term. He will not get it because of all the damage he has done to the stock market all year. His shutdown, bloodbath on stocks today will keep him from being re-elected. Merry Xmas, you ruined the stock market
2984 2018-12-24 15:18:56 Conversely, when the market does well, not Trump’s doings, Obama handed over a good economy. But when stocks are down, it’s him and his incompetent administration’s fault.
2985 2018-12-24 15:18:50 You predicted todays us stocks markets deep red also simply amazing yet after too much losses there no recovery and todays fall that u predicted is simply minf blowing. 10/10
2986 2018-12-24 15:18:31 Ive never understood consumers when black Friday comes people will stand in the cold and push and shove to get an instant pot 50% off.
But when stocks go on sale like they are right now people FREAK OUT.
Have the same mindset! 
Go shopping this week in your investment account!
2987 2018-12-24 15:18:01 68% of S&P 500 stocks are in a bear market.

2988 2018-12-24 15:18:01 Its simple should have pulled out of high risk stocks a year ago. If you believe that the stock market was going to keep climbing and not adjust its self you deserved to loose your money. If you moved you money into low risk stocks then your doing just fine

2993 2018-12-24 15:17:15 ....He has met with school shooting survivors to discuss solutions, one being increased security for public schools. He just banned bump stocks & passed prison reform, & he even offered to send then National Guard to help Chicago fix its crime epidemic.

Don knew that the fault surely lay with the Grinch
He just shook his head and was turning around

2995 2018-12-24 15:17:01 As an ordained minister with >20yrs experience in markets I can assure you God takes a hands-off approach to stocks.
2996 2018-12-24 15:17:00 Barack gave billions to Iran forcing DoD to lay-off a ton of American workers. Are you kidding yourself this propaganda force stocks to be crushed.
2997 2018-12-24 15:16:42 I love the CSCO chart, and show this to everyone trying to "buy the dip" in fang stocks.  No one seems to care about history and how long these past leaders can remain dead money.  Cisco is still a great company to boot!
2998 2018-12-24 15:16:40 Maybe we should think of it less as a selloff, more as a discount on stocks the day before Christmas.

Doing minor trades inbetween.

3032 2018-12-24 15:12:17 I predict bullish price action until New Year's or so, then more downturn for about a month. Unless bear market in stocks flees to Crypto which is questionable as crypto is a high risk asset. $btc

3042 2018-12-24 15:10:48 Merry Xmas and Happy Holidays from Next Big Trade! $UUP making a dramatic move lower so far today.  Gold stocks are heating up $GDX $GLD
3043 2018-12-24 15:10:37 Warren Buffett just sat back for the last 2 years fully invested in grocery stores and soda companies while everyone got mad gains from tech stocks. And in the end, Buffett triumphs
3044 2018-12-24 15:10:30 FED needs to start acquiring stocks for the U.S. taxpayer now...
3045 2018-12-24 15:10:20 Anybody else concerned about US stocks having its worst week in a decade? Y’all remember what happened in 2008?
3046 2018-12-24 15:10:08 Mr. Mnuchin’s efforts to soothe investors may have had the opposite effect. US stocks dropping again today 1%-2%. Ouch. Last week was the worst in ten years. Trumpism isn't working.
3047 2018-12-24 15:10:02 When I have spare cash, share prices are high. When share prices are low, I have huge receivables from clients. When I buy shares, prices drop drastically in quick time. Is it only me going through this? #Sensex #Nifty #MerryChristmas2018 no matter which way stocks move! 
3048 2018-12-24 15:09:52 Blah, blah, blah. Sure it is.
Stocks are down more than 400 points, Dear Leader. Tweet about that!

3049 2018-12-24 15:09:49 Now that you mention it, yes, the Trump crime family in stocks out in the yard at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave sounds good.
3050 2018-12-24 15:09:40 I hope my stocks do the same . As for now . I can’t look
3051 2018-12-24 15:09:29 that's fine... tis the season to buy stocks
3052 2018-12-24 15:09:28 So you put someone in charge of the Pentagon with NO military experience?!! WTF is going on? YOU are destroying America! We are losing our money. Your idiotic mistakes are driving down stocks...lowest since the great depression... analysts warned us. Heed their warning people!
3053 2018-12-24 15:09:07 #Bitcoin, Gold up as $USD and stocks drop. Trillions in global wealth looking for safe havens like Bitcoin and Gold. If trend continues, new ATH for Bitcoin and Gold In play.
3054 2018-12-24 15:08:47 Precisely - very few people are buying options too; mostly to do with high premiums associated with the volatility.  I only see actions in stocks like Nike, Citi, Blackberry and Goldcorp.  This is one depressing market scarring the newbie investors for a lifetime.
3055 2018-12-24 15:08:27 Every day, Liar reinforces his stupidity & incompetence.  Typical of fools, he always blames others instead of assuming responsibility for his actions.  Stocks go up, he takes credit, stocks tank, he fires someone - he’s good at that; too bad he can’t fire himself! DANGEROUS!!!!!
3056 2018-12-24 15:08:23 Crypto ijo, stocks terjun bebas, merry christmas 
3057 2018-12-24 15:08:11 Crazy $MB deal not putting a bid on other SAAS stocks. Say what you will about PE, but their timeline isn't this week, and they have a S-Ton of money to put to work. There will be deals.
3058 2018-12-24 15:07:41 Oh, ok, because stocks haven't been going down for weeks....
3059 2018-12-24 15:07:05 In your mind—when stocks go up, somebody else’s fault. When they go down, trump’s fault.
3060 2018-12-24 15:07:01 I'm confused though - I thought Mnuchin called everyone from Cabo over the weekend.  Shouldn't that have taken care of this?  Why are stocks down again?  It's almost like producing Lego Batman doesn't prepare you to be responsible for the global economy's health and security.
3061 2018-12-24 15:07:01 Hold on, when stocks are up you credit Obama, when stocks drop you blame Trump. Have you noticed the FACT that since the midterms and the Democrats resurgence is when the market began dropping. Just stating the facts.
3062 2018-12-24 15:06:55 A person should be investing in stocks for the long run right here
3063 2018-12-24 15:06:48 The Trump Bump has turned into the Trump Dump

Stocks are having the worst December since the Great Depression
The Dow is down 7.8% and the S&P 500 is down 7.6% this month. That's the worst December performance since 1931.
3064 2018-12-24 15:06:47 I’m new to some of this. How will these phone calls potentially affect the stocks?
3065 2018-12-24 15:06:41 Stocks down 370. Will the US be his next bankruptcy?
3066 2018-12-24 15:06:40 re short $GOOS at $41.34 up on the ticker so far this AM.. im really trying to get that $41 support crack if market fades for the next 1.5 hours before half day close ... lets do it! #shredlife #stocks #daytrading #christmaseve

3076 2018-12-24 15:05:57 It’s not limited to stocks. It’s everything.
3077 2018-12-24 15:05:16 Trump, Mnuchin calm amid shutdown, and bumpy stocks.
3078 2018-12-24 15:05:09 The thing that amazes me the most about trading lately is how many biotech stocks go down 5%-10% on single digit thousand share volume.
3079 2018-12-24 15:05:01 Ah yes, the classic "should I keep my bump stocks or go to jail for murder" conundrum. Gotta weigh the pros and cons of each carefully

3083 2018-12-24 15:04:22 Stocks are on pace for their worst December since the Great Depression. On Friday, the Dow ended its worst week since 2008. The Nasdaq is in a bear market.
3084 2018-12-24 15:04:02 Every morning I wake up and have a few dozen updates on all the stocks dropping and it hurts not only my heart but most importantly my wallet
3085 2018-12-24 15:03:50 Good news for those who were expecting during years a market correction to buy some stocks...
3086 2018-12-24 15:03:45 How's the stock market? Here, let me fill you in: Stocks are on pace for their worst December since the Great Depression. On Friday, the Dow ended its worst week since 2008. The Nasdaq is in a bear market. #TrumResign #TrumpShutdown
3087 2018-12-24 15:03:36 Not sure why walsteeet is so blind to gold stocks. While SP500, Dow Jones, NASDAQ are losing 1.7-2% a day, forex gold and gold stocks are gaining 2% a day. I’m an unskilled workforce and I see this. Wish I was a hedge fund.
3088 2018-12-24 15:03:32 How are those stocks ( you konw...the ones you took so much credit for) doing today?
3089 2018-12-24 15:03:31 Remember, when stocks go up, it's proof of Trump's genius, but when they go down, it's someone else's fault. Probably a conspiracy by the deep state's allies, the deep private sector.
3090 2018-12-24 15:03:26 Economics:  how to pick stocks (don’t, just invest in an index fund), how to do their taxes (turbo tax, or that free electronic tax form the government offers)
3091 2018-12-24 15:03:12 If you're freaking out over stock market stop! Much needed adjustment from the very overvalued tech stocks. Amazon was over $2k..crazy prices. Impt is that price of oil is DOWN which significantly benefits US, the consumer with lower prices at pump. China lowering tariffs

3101 2018-12-24 15:02:03 Mnuchin..since I have never lived in my parents basement, I am buying stocks and holding others in my portfolio. Remember, end of year sell offs also are about adjusting your portfolio and tax reasons. All will be OK the economy is strong.

3106 2018-12-24 15:00:46 The gold bugs excitement index has not been this high in years. Safety finding its way into precious metals and gold/silver stocks as the markets plunge deepens. It will accelerate as the panic & fear spike as this market crisis develops & we understand what is truly behind this.
3107 2018-12-24 15:00:29 We have a LONG way to go down. Stocks just jumped off the building. I laugh at the folks who say we're near the capitulation zone. Lol. Not even close

3109 2018-12-24 15:00:19 Unless you're retiring very soon and have bucked conventional wisdom on how your investments should be allocated between stocks and bonds over time, the movements of the stock market have very little effect on the average person.
3110 2018-12-24 15:00:11 beast bro.
one question tho: why u played the market instead of weak market stocks?
3111 2018-12-24 15:00:07 Stock drop: $TSLA and 0 other stocks drop. The Common Wealth is investigating! Reach out for more info. TheCommonWealth.mail@gmail.com #StockDrop #TSLA
3112 2018-12-24 15:00:07 Govt could buy stocks and then build a wall on dividend.

3114 2018-12-24 14:59:49 isnt gold and silver supposed to g up when stocks fall? or isnt that very common?
3115 2018-12-24 14:59:49 Might exit here very soon. Don't really want to hold much stocks anyways as crisis is coming
3116 2018-12-24 14:59:33 your point? Stocks go up they go down.
3117 2018-12-24 14:59:21 3/ This leads to:
- usd down
- UST yields up
- US stocks down
- Gold up

Ie becomes a sell US trend; crypto wins then hopefully

When this happens - i don’t know. Market will tell us. Correlations of these assets are good to watch.
3118 2018-12-24 14:59:16 Correct  I saw Mike Wilson MS say this is not the time to be long software stocks
3119 2018-12-24 14:59:13 Aren’t we adding to the problem by raising rates? This puts downward pressure on stocks and upward pressure on USD. A strengthening USD then places more downward pressure on commodities.  > more disinflation / deflation

3123 2018-12-24 14:58:47 Hi Ronnie I’m a subscriber that will be in a position to start taking advantage of stocks. If you could include all of your recommendations to date that will be great. Thanks
3124 2018-12-24 14:58:19 It's doubtful China will buckle first on trade war. The stock market will eventually put much more pressure on Trump than Xi. China is ok with a bond bid and the % of its population holding stocks is a small fraction of US ownership. And it's a dictatorship. Not art of the deal.
3125 2018-12-24 14:58:17 If nothing else, the dismal performance of stocks $SPX is a direct reflection of the sheer and utter incompetence of the catastrophically inept @realDonaldTrump administration. Sad.
3126 2018-12-24 14:58:10 This leads to:

3127 2018-12-24 14:58:03 Ya might be good idea watching sq mostly just now not sure if 50 holds as for the rest of those stocks all market related as to why it’s down difficult to time the bottom

Biased, and clueless, ofc.

3142 2018-12-24 14:56:22 Simplest way to think of it is like this:

Let’s say you choose to buy 15 stocks to “minimize idiosyncratic risk.”  I also buy 15 stocks to “minimize idiosyncratic risk.”

At the end of 10 years, we could have very, very different results based on the stocks we picked.

3145 2018-12-24 14:56:03 Hi
I just want to know how do you come to such stocks?
Do you just randomly find it on moneycontrol?
Do you hear it from someone first?
I really want to know this.
Thanks
3146 2018-12-24 14:55:44 Stocks down another 350.  You guys are really, really bad at this.
3147 2018-12-24 14:55:41 C'est la grande classe.
(Oui j'ai une semaine pour déverser mes stocks de vannes pourries non faites)
3148 2018-12-24 14:55:40 Even on Christmas Eve another 2% lower. Stocks are absolutely toast. It was a great run.
3149 2018-12-24 14:55:31 This could be epic!
3150 2018-12-24 14:55:28 In 98, the Fed ‘heard rhe market’, essed, refuelled the rally, had to tighten, blew stuff up. On 04 they delayed and delayed til it was too late. Shops are full, but tech stocks are getting beaten up. Was last week a mistake or a mistake avoided? #teamJay
3151 2018-12-24 14:54:56 Stocks are down more than 300 points! Congrats!
3152 2018-12-24 14:54:40 Could some be end of year trading as investors are looking to write off their losing stocks in time for filing their 2018 taxes?

3154 2018-12-24 14:54:23 Understandable and convenient.  
"Zeroed" can be applied to scales as well as stocks..
3155 2018-12-24 14:54:06 So how's everyones stocks going?
3156 2018-12-24 14:54:04 The fact that most stocks are down more than 30% some being down 50% is a good comparable. Crypto is mostly speculation right now while these companies have cash flow and have been around for years.
3157 2018-12-24 14:53:57 Are foreign countries selling USA stocks?  Noted that US dollar  declined even after surprise hawkish Federal Reserve meeting...not a  good sign...trump abandons our allies ...and our allies may have had  enough of trump...  @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP

3166 2018-12-24 14:52:31 The market to watch are the credit markets and my understanding is the curve is inverting. This means people are moving money out of stocks and short term investments in a flight to safety.

If you don’t convert to cash then it’s probably smart to follow the experts to safety.
3167 2018-12-24 14:52:25 Access to stocks, gold, shorting and other investment instruments that only accredited investors have access today via a tokenized proxy IMO would be a killer app. Global access to buy stock in tesla, Apple, index funds, etc, instead today most can only buy a lottery ticket.

3173 2018-12-24 14:50:50 NEW YORK (AP) - Stocks are opening lower on Wall Street Monday as key U.S. indexes remain on course for their worst December since the 1930s.
3174 2018-12-24 14:50:40 Excuse me but im sure the federal reserve raised rates for Trump and kept them dangerously low for Obama. You are all liars. Also market correction is not recession. Low rates encouraged borrowing which were spent on stocks. To keep socialism looking better. Forget you.

3176 2018-12-24 14:49:39 Every one of my stocks are down this shit is killing me. This 1st year has been a good one until these last 2 months
3177 2018-12-24 14:49:32 Stocks are down 300 points already. Isn’t December usually a good month for the market because of sales? This is how bad this president is.

3183 2018-12-24 14:48:37 What the hell is going around n out here?? Planning on taking the bank(stocks) route. Thoughts?
3184 2018-12-24 14:48:27 Couple things that are always overlooked regarding stock market:
it started its dip when Dems won the House 
the economy is actually doing WELL 
stocks were going UP & UP with Trump...there is NO doubt Fed & Deep State are behind the scenes, trying to produce a crash
3185 2018-12-24 14:48:18 I usually just roll my eyes and keep scrolling when I see him discuss investments and stocks. There have been plenty of times where he more or less copy/pasted the same crap someone else said on another page. He doesn't seem to know much about the subject, but that's irrelevant.

3192 2018-12-24 14:47:37 @realDonaldTrump If you try to keep the market inflated, no one will win because it can't keep going up up up. Stocks are just magical pieces of paper. Gambling. I am an engineer not a financial analyst. My grandfather lost 100k in 29.
3193 2018-12-24 14:47:33 WHAT STOCKS DOES TRUMP OWN, IS HE BETTING THE MARKET GOES DOWN  HE IS MANIPULATING THE MARKET

The traders were nestled all snug in their beds, while visions of scotch danced in their heads..
3196 2018-12-24 14:46:54 This just in: stocks will go down forever
3197 2018-12-24 14:46:53 This Fake Crisis in the Stocks etc is being Artificially Created by @realDonaldTrump enemies! Everyone has said from day dot, you need to hurt him in the Stock Market, you need to ensure the Economy Tanks! His detractors hate him that much that they will ruin each American!
3198 2018-12-24 14:46:49 I guess this is the best time to buy stocks right?
3199 2018-12-24 14:46:44 Investors are non political, they vote with their $$. Right now, they are giving Trump a vote of No Confidence as they continue to sell US stocks.
3200 2018-12-24 14:46:42 The only 2 stocks on my watch list positive, right now, are FB and SNAP. I think I woke up into another dimension.

He's got one last big nut to fix, a trade deal with China, and their economy is worse off than a long time because of him.
They will make a better deal w/US. Stocks will go back up.

3213 2018-12-24 14:43:05 Mnuchin calling in the PPT at these levels was a shocking move.

I think it will backfire.

He should have said "Sometimes stocks go up. Sometimes they go down. But the economy is in good shape."

3244 2018-12-24 14:36:38 This is the worst month for stocks since late 2008 and the worst December since 1931.. i think it’s reasonable for the Treasury to make sure that this isn’t creating liquidity issues and that this isn’t a symptom of something more ominous lurking in the background

But what about this.. which you own!!!
December is typically a buoyant month for stocks. Yet both the Dow and S&P 500 are down more than 12 percent this month -- on track for their worst December performances since the Great Depression in 1931.

3285 2018-12-24 14:27:05 @davidpakmanshow unfortunately I heard your rant about Trump. I can see from your journalistic perspective you have not done your research about Trump. Bum Stocks, opioid and other actions he has taken that I am pretty sure the saving grace Obama never touched. Sorry Reporting.
3286 2018-12-24 14:26:56 Its so easy for the Fed to crash the markets and the economy with their big bank partners. Use the QE to buy stocks, then on command dump the stocks to crash the markets while blaming @potus so he loses in 2020.

3299 2018-12-24 14:22:55 Jim, does Mnuchin REALLY think this sell-off in stocks is being fueled by a lack of bank liquidity?
3300 2018-12-24 14:22:15 Great option for sure. It will respond quicker to rising rates (greater income) compared to bond portfolio. Of course, we don't get that inverse relationship to stocks. I think Canadian bond universe is up about 5% in recently volatilty. That's more than a year of GIC payments 
3301 2018-12-24 14:21:28 Sad to see $AMRN hit $12s in premarket... I hope everyone has been heeding my warnings. This is why I try to avoid individual stocks whenever the market is selling off like this.  Inverse ETF funds are the only ones that make money when the market tanks.  Nothing else is "safe".
3302 2018-12-24 14:21:13 @jimcramer @MadMoneyOnCNBC @FoxBusiness I’m a little concerned this week as everyone left Wall Street for the holiday but the computers are still there trading.  This could be really bad.   No liquidity and indiscriminate computer selling.  It seems most stocks  hit 52 week lows.
3303 2018-12-24 14:20:53 Stocks getting a little taste of the pain today. 

52 week low alerts popping off like fireworks.
3304 2018-12-24 14:20:34 I lost both my stocks
3305 2018-12-24 14:20:24 But you and I know retail stocks have been enfuego since summer 2017 when cramer said amzn kills all 
And you and i know that retail sells off this time of year
The smart money buys before
Time to buy em up to sell again next summer
$WMT $TGT
3306 2018-12-24 14:20:16 The stocks are at a low right now. Good time to invest
3307 2018-12-24 14:20:14 Essentially yes. Also down the road these traders could use for securities, stocks, commodities. XRP will be the universal settlement option for 2-3 seconds whenever needed, you just say hey, i need to settle my debits/credits as to get to my final destination with my XRP.
3308 2018-12-24 14:20:13 I see all my 8 stocks hit bottom on hourly chart. But just follow 5sma moving with MACD moving so you can decide up or down. Or go back to warm bed ha!!
3309 2018-12-24 14:20:13 Working class does NOT support Trump, you loser!! He doesn’t have a clue, he’s all over the place on everything, stocks are crashing, National Debt is highest its ever been, he shut down the Gov at Xmas!!! He’s a fucking dumbass! I guess we now know why YOU support him. 
3310 2018-12-24 14:20:05 Uh oh, tech stocks are dropping mid holiday season, 2019 is going to be wild for tech companies if this the first tech bubble burst
3311 2018-12-24 14:20:01 A lot of stocks hitting a all time low this week , today.
3312 2018-12-24 14:19:56 Fuck this gov shut down lol my stocks are getting fucked!
3313 2018-12-24 14:19:50 Yes... they should ban algos on stocks under 2$
3314 2018-12-24 14:19:33 Ppl going nuts on #Trump here, but really no have clue as to cause —> effect

Questions: Did Donny -
- make ppl think $NVDA (chip stock) was worth 60X?
- upgrade $AMZN to 2500
- run stocks straight up for 18 months?

Nope.  That’s easy $ + Street + @CNBC
3315 2018-12-24 14:19:30 Bet those stocks did well until they decided to raise rates... twice! Thinking about it again. They’re manipulating the market to bring down our Pres. It’s an evil deep state in concert w media. Unbelievable hatred.
3316 2018-12-24 14:19:22 J.P. Morgan dim outlook on global market stocks! - RT Back What is your perspective?
3317 2018-12-24 14:19:07 Stocks are hitting 52 week lows in pre-market.... Merry Christmas
3318 2018-12-24 14:18:53 Yep, times are all over it and baying for blood. It looks accidental, (unlike Kocketts last week), but given its Glos he'll probably get a 3 year ban and be put in the stocks on boxing day.
3319 2018-12-24 14:18:48 The game is rigged y’all  -he & his buddies probably sold their stocks after the tax cuts, when they predictably soared, & waited for the planned panicked sell off to buy low. 
BTW Mercer’s high speed trading makes him billions & is as crooked as a dog’s hind leg.
3320 2018-12-24 14:18:22 So many stocks hitting their 52 week low. It’s a buyers market right now
3321 2018-12-24 14:18:11 Business advice is often total crap, but what I do know is that don't play the penny stocks..
3322 2018-12-24 14:18:02 I own some GoPro stocks! :) I believe in the fundamentals and I will keep liking all their Instagram clips until we go up again like a red bull hot air balloon!
3323 2018-12-24 14:17:45 No liquidity issues, then.
Hope he shorted something last week. 
Bank stocks, maybe.
3324 2018-12-24 14:17:40 And what have you done to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons in Iran?  How about North Korea?  You are not capable of running this country.  You’re putting America in danger and making us laughing stocks.  Resign already!
3325 2018-12-24 14:17:09 Buy a few stocks while this shit is at a 52 week low
3326 2018-12-24 14:17:04 He’ll go to the floor of the NYSE and buy stocks next
3327 2018-12-24 14:17:02 Stocks down time to buy more 
3328 2018-12-24 14:16:11 Real economy remains strong. Stocks not so much
3329 2018-12-24 14:15:41 Travelling has been good today but I cant find anywhere between Rothesay and Aberdeen that stocks regular Pepsi
3330 2018-12-24 14:14:57 @jimcramer 
Although it’s been said, many times, many ways,

The FANG stocks really bite this year!

Merry Christmas, to you. 

Imagine that in the voice of Bing Crosby 
3331 2018-12-24 14:13:57 #stocks $spx #Mnuchin there is no liquidity crisis. No global recession. The only crisis is one of leadership. Scary, yes, but we have things called elections that will remedy this. markets will overcome current agita and rally big in 2019. Relax and have a merry Christmas!
3332 2018-12-24 14:13:51 @AOTtrades Also the FAANG stocks head very high volume later last week.
3333 2018-12-24 14:13:46 This will be the first year in my data set going back to 1976 (n=13) where a rise in 2-year yields and a positively sloped yield curve didn't lead to a rise in stocks the following year.
3334 2018-12-24 14:13:39 Pot stocks gonna gap lower with $NBEV and $TLRY looking weakest

$ACB $CGC $CRON $MJ
3335 2018-12-24 14:13:33 The U.S. Bond markets will close early today at 2pm ET, Stocks close at 1pm. All markets are closed tomorrow for Christmas.
3336 2018-12-24 14:13:24 Stocks should recover quickly once uncertainties on China trade and Fed policies get sorted out.
3337 2018-12-24 14:13:16 Believe me, they make a whole lot more from the money they take on the side, under the table, playing the stocks with inside information (they exempted themselves on this and many other laws that we have to obey).
3338 2018-12-24 14:13:11 @Fidelity Is there no accountability for Fidelity when its customers lose money due to Fidelity's inability to answer their calls? What's the point of having a fund manager that you cannot contact when you see your stocks going down?
3339 2018-12-24 14:13:09 Same basis, cheapest S&P500 stocks $MU, $WDC, $NFX, $BHF, $GM although a little more expensive - all below 5.07x TTM
3340 2018-12-24 14:13:07 All the stocks I keep up with hitting 52 week lows

3345 2018-12-24 14:11:07 Kumbaga sa Department store, disposing old stocks. Baka naman promo at may kasamang extra 100? Nyahahaha!

Merry Christmans po!
3346 2018-12-24 14:11:03 Trump and many other rich Republicans consider economic collapses as buying opportunities. When people go broke, land and stocks are cheap. And even if they end up loosing some money in the short term, this allows them to buy up a larger piece of the pot. Lock him up already
3347 2018-12-24 14:10:55 You think all fishermen should be able to fish as many fish as they like? What would you say to them once the fish stocks have ran out? You’d probably say “ok guys we’re going to have to start putting quotas on our fishing hauls to sustain the natural fish population”

3353 2018-12-24 14:08:26 Today's gallows humor from the opening lines of CNN article:

"US markets are open only a half day on Monday. That's probably a good thing for anyone watching stocks on Christmas Eve".
3354 2018-12-24 14:07:58 In Related News: Steve Mnuchin shorted all bank stocks.
3355 2018-12-24 14:07:53 This is common.  Earnings and share prices are out of phase.  You want to buy stocks when earnings growth is weak.
3356 2018-12-24 14:06:45 There was a fair amount of consensus that 2018 would be a tough year to make money in equities except for in very very select stocks.
3357 2018-12-24 14:06:34 Hoy el problema inmediato es vender los stocks de vino a granel, medianas empresas de la 7ma están desesperados porque no hay poder comprador, ventas que representan el 75% del total de sus ingrasos. La situación es delicada.

3360 2018-12-24 14:06:14 Markets are noticing total chaos that includes shutdown: Worst December for stocks since 1931; 7% loss just last week; emergency calls by Treas. Secretary Mnuchin over the weekend because panic is starting, as POTUS talks about firing Fed Chairman.
3361 2018-12-24 14:05:20 According to one screen, the five cheapest #Canadian stocks on  TTM basis are $CFP.TO, $OSB.TO, $GRT.UN.TO, $PXT.TO, $DRG.UN.TO - all less than 5x trailing.
3362 2018-12-24 14:05:15 Um, didn’t I read another CNBC article like 5 minutes ago stating that there are zero analysts who say stocks will suffer next year? Which is it, boys? Or global stocks will tank but US won’t? How can that happen?
3363 2018-12-24 14:04:58 The whole idea of a Plunge Protection desk/team makes my blood boil.

I don't own stocks, so why should my tax dollars backstop them?

I also don't gamble and won't support a program to reimburse casino losses.

Seem logical..?
3364 2018-12-24 14:04:53 Half these “30% off the high” stocks are still up 30% YTD.

3367 2018-12-24 14:02:43 Really? oil stocks plummeted in 2014-2015 bankrupting americans all over but i guess you lib will blame it in Saudi Arabia
3368 2018-12-24 14:02:17 50% of families own no stocks at all.

Many are doing better except for the ones that need it most
3369 2018-12-24 14:02:08 When it comes to #Stocks we were clearly at the end of #Optimism and end of #2018 #ProfitTakers; however, @federalreserve move was expected. What wasn’t is the US geopolitical @WhiteHouse, @POTUS had a more controllable part but everyone is afraid to tell him!
3370 2018-12-24 14:01:57 Also remember that Trump opportunistically capitalized on a movement of working class people “revolting” against establishment elites. They own very little in stocks and will enjoy watching coastal elites panic/piss/moan. He is also building coalition of Latino+black males
3371 2018-12-24 14:01:37 The conversation on Facebook about Trump banning bump stocks took 3-4 years off of my life.
3372 2018-12-24 14:01:36 They started imports a couple of weeks ago. Too little and too late to cut the massive stocks and it's all being bought by the Chinese state companies (because the duties of 25% are still there) but you statement is not true.

3376 2018-12-24 13:59:24 Someone needs to explain to me what use bump stocks have in civilian life. Besides, semi-automatic 'modern sporting rifles' are based on military weapons. But the bigger point? Maybe a little less focus on semantics and a little more focus on solving the problem of mass murders.
3377 2018-12-24 13:59:20 And stocks have lesser volatility than bonds here! It's the truth what appears
3378 2018-12-24 13:59:13 Keep an eye on stocks today, all signs point to a bad day. Futures down, gold up
3379 2018-12-24 13:58:02 Please help me tanky
It's six stocks Vs 3 stocks and I'm already in a 2v1 situation gghhhhhhh
3380 2018-12-24 13:57:18 Shit Stocks! 
3381 2018-12-24 13:57:01 $spx...The guy on CNBC saying that with bonds rates so low, there is no alternative but stocks. Heck I can still get 2.7 risk free in 2 year Treasury notes.
3382 2018-12-24 13:56:38 I can't recall a Christmas eve day that markets were up (grains, stocks, etc). It seems that it's always easier (and faster) to fall than rise.

3384 2018-12-24 13:56:02 @realDonaldTrump another terrible year!!! Stocks have tanked, every credible person is quitting and the wanna be dictator sits in the @WhiteHouse tweeting
3385 2018-12-24 13:55:43 Hmm, is this the same Patrick Shanahan that is a DOD subcontractor, what  stocks does he hold? Why do you think this guy was chosen? His stellar career in the military*cough*non-existent*cough* The guy is a glorified lobbyist. Just another swamp pick.
3386 2018-12-24 13:55:40 European stocks spooked by U.S. shutdown, political turmoil
3387 2018-12-24 13:55:37 @jyarow fix what ? When you drop 5 trillion in over last 8 years into 20 stocks..it is bound to pull back
3388 2018-12-24 13:55:35 Let me guess all the insider info needed to dump stocks at the proper time?
3389 2018-12-24 13:54:33 Yup, + on oversold readings and sentiment worse than at a funeral. I think the interest of buying stocks right now is poor, which is why it can not catch a bid, and any increase in liquidity gets sold into. I saw someone saying hedge fund liquidation EOY cuz shutting down.
3390 2018-12-24 13:54:19 we still have remaining cupsleeves to give out. special thanks to @shuacafesg and @EFFLORESCENCEJS for allowing us to distribute the cupsleeves 

each person is able to receive a cupsleeve and a set of pcs while stocks lasts.
3391 2018-12-24 13:54:17 I'd like to see border protection keeping our fish stocks safe and preventing whaling in our oceans not wasting billions of our taxes on propaganda.

3393 2018-12-24 13:52:53 “And it is told how #TariffMan, having breached his own wall, stood boldly in the gap shouting ‘death to globalists’ even as the Market Forces rushed at him. With stocks tumbling all about, he raged until the dust settled. He had been overrun. ‘Not my fault’ he gasped as he died
3394 2018-12-24 13:52:50 this administration continues to have no clue as to the psychology of the mkt. Maybe the old statement "when in doubt, do nothing' maybe trump & team should take a twitter break. I will say Mnunchin is probably one of the better of the administration team #stocks
3395 2018-12-24 13:52:46 Like bernie boom boom, the "plot" against O'Rourke is silly. One need only look at his voting record. My only question is , if elected, will he wear his IOF uniform and carry an AR-15 with bump stocks at his inauguration?
3396 2018-12-24 13:52:02 Last fed meeting they said 3 hikes now they said 2.  The market is upset he didn't say they would buy stocks.
3397 2018-12-24 13:51:49 Someone needs to look at how many stocks his family is buying as soon as he tweets.

3401 2018-12-24 13:50:10 Are stocks the new tulip bubble? Are stocks a scam after they drop 60%. The answer is no, but the rich dont get richer if the trend continues up. Crashes must happen
3402 2018-12-24 13:49:20 Financial stocks fall as Mnuchin's attempt to reassure investors appears to backfire
3403 2018-12-24 13:49:04 Many major stocks are about to open below lower BB on daily chart. This usually ends up in a green candle - close above the open price - for the day. $AMZN $AAPL $SPX $ADBE $CRM $GOOS $NFLX $SQ $QQQ

3411 2018-12-24 13:44:50 @SquawkCNBC Do the wealthy benefit significantly  from sell off- great tax losses and then buy beaten down stocks in 2019 or sooner?  And is it more the wealthy selling gains and losses than the algos?
3412 2018-12-24 13:44:41 I think he was absolutely right to call the banks! The bank stocks are in a free-fall. If we would’ve been on top of it sooner the last time we could’ve saved a lot of pain
3413 2018-12-24 13:44:22 SOCIAL SOLIDARITY stocks climb despite troubling geopolitical headlines
3414 2018-12-24 13:43:41 apple stocks rise by 69%.
3415 2018-12-24 13:43:39 I’m inclined to think similarly. There must be value at this range, but due to the combination of stocks into ETFs and broader funds all having the ripcord pulled, every share’s a possible drowning victim.
3416 2018-12-24 13:43:07 I didn’t leave Bay St to start a site pumping garbage stocks. And I don’t reply on on threads with Nate cc’d (he’s doxing us -I don’t wish that on you). All our research is our own opinion, & our opinions aren’t paid for -period. We back our calls with our own money. Merry x-mas

3418 2018-12-24 13:40:58 The traffic was queuing to get into Tesco car park when I sent John out to replenish wine stocks and get pringles.
3419 2018-12-24 13:40:14 It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that, assuming potential recession is true, raising interest rates is the #DeepState starting the fire and throwing gas on it. They want to drive stocks down, take away your wealth, and hurt America to get Trump approval down
3420 2018-12-24 13:39:45 It always does...it’s just a matter of how long it will take to do so and what stocks will out perform and which will disappoint. Remember, stocks are at the mercy of those who short sell and the clean up crew, not necessarily about the company’s or the products themselves.
3421 2018-12-24 13:39:23 Several cannabis stocks are trading lower after the recently passed Farm Bill labels hemp oil as a drug ingredient requiring approval for use in products. CBC currently not permitted based on what I'm reading. $ACB $NBEV
3422 2018-12-24 13:38:35 I can imagine a world where Hydro Quebec checks my meter and deducts a few cents from my chequing account every second.
And my pension adds a few cents to my chequing account every second.
But instead it's monthly (or bimonthly) lumps.
Flows are converted into stocks.
3423 2018-12-24 13:38:34 1. Trump shouldn’t have aligned himself with the stock market and been constantly pumping stocks with fake trade news. 

2. Powell shouldn’t have raised rates. 

3. Mnuchin shouldn’t have gotten drunk on vacation and spooked the markets. 

Mistakes all around.
3424 2018-12-24 13:36:54 $YUM In the end the last good stocks will be cut in half, since there is nothing left to dump.
3425 2018-12-24 13:36:52 Stop chasing the Index. PSX Index is a very untrue representation of the overall market. People get fooled by looking at the Index instead of looking at the broad markets which is gauged by looking at percentage of ALL STOCKS traded in s bear or a bull market.
3426 2018-12-24 13:36:46 Last year it was to sell all and any crypto. This time around it’s buy stocks
3427 2018-12-24 13:36:45 “Hey Udi! We made a thing. It’s just like that thing that you like. What do you think about it?”

“It’s nothing like my thing, sir. Your thing is a penny stock. But penny stocks are cool too mate, good luck”

“NO! YOU’RE A FILTHY MAXIMALIST! MY THING IS JUST LIKE YOUR THING!”
3428 2018-12-24 13:36:43 My question is is this a ploy of the ASS@realDonaldTrump to destroy the stock market so hisbuddies can swoop in and buy all the stock they choose at a lower price knowing stocks will survive and they will become richer since large companies are buying back their stocks hmmm
3429 2018-12-24 13:36:23 Do yourself a favor and read Animal Farm. All of the "great things" that Trump has done are about to trigger a catastrophe.  Just as a start, some of my dad's most stable stocks have fallen greatly thanks to the stable genius and his tariffs.
3430 2018-12-24 13:35:08 Do you use fundamental data to select growth stocks or just price?
3431 2018-12-24 13:35:00 All (or many) of us (including pension funds)are seeking highest returns on our stocks/mutual funds/investments; not just companies. Till our mindset changes towards long-range more sustainable investments, these will be sacrificed in favor of profit maximization above all else.
3432 2018-12-24 13:34:51 so you are saying this rally is not a dead cat bounce ? we could go to more then 5k and then down more then 3k. Stocks going down and bitcoin is speculative asset for big boys I'm not sure till it go back to 20k :D
3433 2018-12-24 13:34:05 In a head to head study the bump stocks will not make an Ar shot any faster there are videos on YouTube that show an Ar with the bump stock and an Ar with out a bump stock going against each other there is very little difference the only reason they want to ban them is to act big

3441 2018-12-24 13:30:34 Aside from interest expectations what will make #EURO bounce, which is a surplus currency, is the fact that investors will repatriate € as US stocks become less attractive 

#JPY is moving higher due to its defensive qualities but the above will make sure it stays bid
3442 2018-12-24 13:29:46 If #Mnuchin asked US Banks 'is everything okay' it's code for asking them (if necessary) to support the market. But, as in 1929, market support only works very short-term. This may be an interesting week. #stocks

3450 2018-12-24 13:27:25 Bitcoin works because it is a purely bearer instrument. There is no counterparty risk. Your keys, your Bitcoin.

Putting other stuff (stocks, real estate, etc.) on a blockchain has no advantages. Those are closely regulated assets, requiring KYC.
3451 2018-12-24 13:27:25 Mark my words, Oil& Gas Stocks buy/sell decisions are the realm of the expert traders & chartists in 2019. This sector is going to leave an ugly trail sure by end 2019 with dad& mum investors and Oil sector employees/servicemen as main casualties.
3452 2018-12-24 13:27:04 Typical Trump blaming head of federal reserve for drop in stocks. He was happy to take credit when it was going up even though it was largely due to Obama.
3453 2018-12-24 13:27:02 What a mess in DC: acting Secretary of Defense, Interior, UN Ambassador, EPA Admin, Deputy HUD, WH Chief, etc. Brexit circus in London. Rome wanting more deficits when they already have massive debts and zombie banks. Stocks aren’t washing out, the populist political movement is.
3454 2018-12-24 13:26:29 Not a bad time to buy stocks though, it all eventually comes back around...or we'll have world war 3... either way it won't matter, nihilistic win-win.
3455 2018-12-24 13:26:22 #yields will stop going lower only if #stocks bounce as safe haven flows dictate the Treasury market
3456 2018-12-24 13:26:21 People trade most ALTs for BTC because that is the pair offered. People trade stocks for USD because that is the pair offered. When portfolio losses become too large, everything gets sold. My portfolio currently consists only of BTC and USD. #MarketOutlook #Equities $crypto

3466 2018-12-24 13:21:08 It’s true for penny stocks like Zcash, litecoin, monero, Tron, dentacoin etc

Certainly not true for bitcoin, where the dev team holds no power over stakeholders

3482 2018-12-24 13:04:11 Random thoughts on stocks vs flows:
I consume a continuous pure flow of electricity (kW).
But even then I pay for it every 2 months in lumpy stocks (kWhrs).
Other examples of pure flows?
Money demand would be very different in a pure flow economy.
3483 2018-12-24 13:03:57 .@realDonaldTrump Wow, you were handed a gift in the way of a good economy and positive prospects to make it better. Plunging stocks = plunging 401ks, less standing in the world as a leader nation, etc. Awful. Your QBR would be zero in NFL
3484 2018-12-24 13:03:42 Sure they don’t. That’s why our loose gun control laws result in the worse gun violence in the world. And if they don’t work, why ban bump stocks?! It’s because Trump supporters are so brainwashed, they’re suddenly fine with the first confiscatory gun control law in 25 years.
3485 2018-12-24 13:01:25 I can only say what I've seen my friend, lots of folk saying they've given up on the BJP but we're thrilled to see this months edition. I can't really speak personally as I can't afford it and nowhere close stocks it!... but I'd still like to be paid!. 
3486 2018-12-24 13:01:24 Bullseye  as I say, I will buy stocks when I see some debt reduction and healthy growth
3487 2018-12-24 13:00:16 *Sigh......for the zillionth time, gun control laws DO NOT WORK! And bump stocks should have been banned years ago but it took Trump to get it done. And his EO had nothing to do with Hogg.

3489 2018-12-24 13:00:06 Agreed. But every financial market is heavily manipulated. Stocks have govt sponsored plunge protection teams and all to ensure retail doesnt get rekt completely. Manipulation is name of the game for big guys. Cant wish it away so learn from it

3493 2018-12-24 12:57:15 If you were planning to live off retirement income for the next three years and you were hit with a 30% loss, it would be wise to instead work for three more years, continuing to contribute, while your stocks recover...
3494 2018-12-24 12:57:13 I’m betting Big Cheetoh asked for some Big Reassuring Act to reassure the market because he’s being mocked for stocks tanking . . . “Be sure to write it on official stationery, too . . .”

3551 2018-12-24 12:19:20 The average yield on stocks is 2% while debt costs 4.5% (A rated). Paying off debt saves 2.5% and reduces leverage and I predict increases PE multiples. stock prices go higher with debt reduction than stock buybacks. Markets are smarter than CEOs

3569 2018-12-24 11:56:53 In Stock Markets, Choice of Instrument for Beginners should be, 

1) Stocks

2) Learning to Ignore Junk Stocks

3) No "Futures"

4) Definitely No "Options". 

In the end, you will save lot of money by staying away from F&O which your Stocks would compound over long term.

3666 2018-12-24 10:06:04 Only way to bring back tattered economy:

1. Make old 1000 and 500 Rs. Notes a valid currency.
2. Reduce Income tax slab
3. Remove LTCG on Mutual Funds and Stocks immediately.

3743 2018-12-24 08:32:44 The rigged market orchestrates political events to consolidate money (and power, as power comes with money in a world enslaved by fiat money). Wars are a particular passion of the American elite as any threat of an impending war sends Lockheed's stocks literally to the sky.

3780 2018-12-24 07:59:12 Most fashionable and loved stocks seldom deliver what investors expect. What you pay for future growth and earnings is very important, not how famous it is.
3781 2018-12-24 07:58:50 Hi Mohit! While rebalancing ensures that the stocks/ETFs & weights are true to the theme, the returns would depend on how the underlying theme performs. Also, smallcases are long-term investments, so they work best when you stay invested for 3 years or more.
3782 2018-12-24 07:57:23 wew gg to suntec now to take stocks
3783 2018-12-24 07:56:42 Agreed. A short term and long term strategy is not bad though. You don't have to be entirely about the money but most investments have at least some foundation in the mindset of accumulatimg wealth.

In a way, a lot ofnaltcoin projects are the equivalent of penny stocks.

3810 2018-12-24 07:30:41 I think this is probably some combination of idiocy and servility.

Trump probably told him that he should tell the banks to start buying stocks, or something impossibly stupid like that. Mnuchin probably came up with this idea under the requirement of "do something by tomorrow!"

3815 2018-12-24 07:27:04 Stocks are now crashing as well, worst Dec since 1931. Although presidents do not have much influence on the markets, since Trump wanted to take credit for its good days he should take blame for its bad

3848 2018-12-24 06:47:14 Markets are likely to remain volatile in 2019, time to examine your portfolios to determine which are tennis balls (stocks that will bounce back), deflated footballs (will barely bounce) and glass balls (that will disappear in the next bear market).

3852 2018-12-24 06:44:07 Stock prices represent the estimated value of each company's future cash flows. If stocks lose value, it's because investors believe there will be lower profits (!= losses) in the future. As noted, we're due for a downturn. Also, the stock market is not the economy. We're OK.

3878 2018-12-24 06:20:25 I'm as skeptical of fund cos as anyone but seems like the article centers on each manager's use of +/- screening for stocks, which is an "old school" method of ESG investing.

3897 2018-12-24 05:55:46 Funny they weren’t saying that when stocks were ~20% higher. Sooo they recommend buying high and now selling low?  Personally I like to buy low and collect dough

3904 2018-12-24 05:48:55 Lol... alright should have sold the rest of my stocks, shit about to get crazier.
3905 2018-12-24 05:48:51 Stocks are vesting on January 15th and I couldn’t be more proud to actually say that I’m one of a very few people who actually stayed determined through thick and thin and stuck around W/O injury or quitting or getting fired. This was one rough run with such a shitty company.
3906 2018-12-24 05:47:59 Mnuchin wanted to pick up some cheep stocks on his was out the door.
3907 2018-12-24 05:47:31 .@darsky: on a serious note, on #CNN earlier @benfergusonshow admitted he supports immigration reform, aka amnesty. That makes him extremely vulnerable since most of the Trump base rejects amnesty.

It's like Bernie coming out for bump stocks.

@hilaryr didn't call him on it.
3908 2018-12-24 05:47:08 I don’t think Trump has any significant investments in any stocks or bonds.  His only consistent source of revenue is real estate, golf clubs + licensing deals. He owes so much in mortgages on existing properties (including Trump Tower), there is very little he owns outright.
3909 2018-12-24 05:46:03 I wonder what would happen to the SF property market in the event of a recession that hammers tech stocks? How many people are dependent on their RSUs to pay their mortgage?

3912 2018-12-24 05:44:14 I disagree. When the time is correct I plan to buy stocks again.  Some beaten down. Oversold. Plan to buy for the grandchildren. Long term buying.
3913 2018-12-24 05:43:06 since US is leaning downwards, we will also see major swings in select stocks particularly high P/E ones which should provide good entry point

the correct answer is : Tax, Interest and Stocks
3915 2018-12-24 05:41:50 It will take forever to create wealth equality, which should be the real goal, via income equality. Please, please, start investigating an intangibles tax on stocks and bonds and address wealth inequality directly.

3919 2018-12-24 05:39:38 Bump stocks are trash anyway. Plus, people are already making them themselves.

3925 2018-12-24 05:32:31 WTH?  Are they trying to rig things to make Trump look good?  Based on the recent news about DT wanting to fire the Fed Chairman, I’m guessing stocks will take a further downturn.

3934 2018-12-24 05:25:31 We pulled our money out of stocks, because we knew it was just a matter of time till people realized Trump is a corrupt, half-wit conman with NO business acumen, & the market went into free-fall. 
It has, and I believe it will continue to do so.

3950 2018-12-24 05:09:07 man must believe in himself & his judgment if he expects to make a living at this game

 nobody can make big money on what someone else tells him to do.

3957 2018-12-24 05:01:55 Speaking in general, a retail investor cannot become an intelligent investor. Not undermining their abilities, but investing by picking stocks and making returns is out of league for him. Hence. go for #indexfunds
3958 2018-12-24 05:01:04 I meant as long as their reasons for buying them aren't illegal.  
Why should they be illegal ? Again, bump stocks themselves hurt nobody.
3959 2018-12-24 05:01:02 Marc’s 2008 story about Goldman is maybe the best lesson for anyone that uses a prime broker or tries to short stocks in a crisis.

3985 2018-12-24 04:42:32 Because putting restrictions on guns only hurt law binding citizenship in the United States and are based entirely on cosmetics. Not to mention President Trump did bam bump stocks by executive order this month.

3988 2018-12-24 04:39:49 Irrelevant. Regardless, roiling paperers are not banned, correct ?  So why should bump stocks be banned ?
3989 2018-12-24 04:39:08 Hardly, bump stocks are more of a marketing myth that they actually fire quicker than without one. In a one on one race with bump stock and no bump stock they are close to a tie! My point is, like you, bump stocks are irrelevant.
3990 2018-12-24 04:38:55 .@mcm_ct - you mentioned something about insurance companies selling volatility over the last few years. Could gov be worried that a big jump in VIX tomorrow will cause insurance stocks to crash and also cause liquidity problems?

4020 2018-12-24 04:09:58 Years ago he proposed a one time, net worth tax on the rich to pay off the national debt. Sounds good but would’ve crashed the global economy — every rich person selling off their stocks all at once. Even on the rare occasion his heart is in the right place, it’s catastrophic.
4021 2018-12-24 04:09:39 So...
What is it?
Merry Christmas MAGA style?
Crashed 401k?
Tanked stocks?
Stagnant wages?
No innovative jobs in tech sectors?
No new energy jobs?
No coal jobs?
No new steel plants?
Indictments?
Prison sentences?
Trump at Mar-a-lago & the Secret Service paying HIM for housing?
4022 2018-12-24 04:08:52 Technical trader here looking for the best entries on OTC and NASDAQ tickers. I like low float stocks , buying the base , trading the breakouts , scaling positions , and loadin like the whales.  I do a little dd and focus on the chart. Price action and volume are key.
4023 2018-12-24 04:08:12 He sold his stocks. He is mad at the Fed because it is affecting the payments on his variable loans.
4024 2018-12-24 04:07:08 Sensex rises over 150 points, Nifty crosses 10,780 amid choppy trade; IT, pharma stocks lead gains
4025 2018-12-24 04:07:03 He's never heard of something called a bank ? And stocks. And bonds an IRA account maybe?investments?
4026 2018-12-24 04:06:23 When that Avery Bradley dunk puts his trading stocks up >>>
4027 2018-12-24 04:06:18 whats hilarious is everyday Doug Kass claims to keep buying more so when the market finally bounces he'll be telling everyone how smart he is. Probably is, he loaded up on bank stocks two months and added all the way down, loaded up on SPY at $255 then $250. @DougKass
4028 2018-12-24 04:06:16 In a team of morons Munchkin stands out as extra stupid. He called the heads of the six largest banks to ask if they had liquidity issues. But we're not in a financial melt down. Stocks are cratering due to the trade war. Far from soothing worries, he demonstrated his ignorance.
4029 2018-12-24 04:04:43 Do you think he may have interest in stocks falling?
4030 2018-12-24 04:04:20 I’m all for capitalism. That’s not cutting taxes for the rich who buy back stocks. Unprecedented Greed will break this country.
4031 2018-12-24 04:04:18 You do realize there are two way bets in every traded instrument right? There are longs and shorts in currencies, bonds, gold, oil, bitcoin, as well as stocks, and options and everything else that's traded. This is a really a short-sighted question on your point
4032 2018-12-24 04:03:43 It’s a little too eerily reminiscent of the floor brokers from JP Morgan, first national city (now Citibank) and bankers trust casually walking around the nyse bidding for random stocks in oct 1929—it just scared people more.
4033 2018-12-24 04:03:42 We are open today and tomorrow! We have stocks of Chocolate Overload , Yema cake and other yummy specialty cakes. We also have limited stocks of leche flan.
4034 2018-12-24 04:03:22 Don’t forget a crumbling stock market, stormi Daniels, Americans as international laughing stocks etc etc
4035 2018-12-24 04:02:15 Anxiety triggering. Don't sweat it. He's signalling for his pals to tank as many stocks as they can. The hedge gets fat on the short, but the 401k of millions will shiver and sink.
4036 2018-12-24 04:02:03 Great. No, raise wasn't lost in the mail.  Seeing more $$ in the paycheck.   Maybe if GM wasn't building that plant in China, 14,000 people wouldn't be laid off.   Not into stocks - it's a rigged game.  Thanks for your concern, though.

4040 2018-12-24 03:59:51 Truthfully, I don't know anymore. One minute it's like the Gang Who Couldn't Shoot Straight and the next minute I think it's on purpose so some someone's can swoop in and buy cheap stocks, real estate, and oil tanking here helps Russia/OPEC because drilling will slow down here.
4041 2018-12-24 03:59:40 OMG....special place in hell for you both. Aside from FINALLY banning bump stocks & Criminal Justice reform, all you 2 you have done is made the rich richer (including yourselves), exploded our deficit, & deteriorated our credibility on the world stage. #TrumpResign

4046 2018-12-24 03:53:28 Really and that means what, no hcare, no Wall, white supremacy reigns, worse December stocks since 1931, worse stock drops since 2008, divisiveness, nuclear proliferation in NKorea, owned by Putin, convictions of 7 of your buddies, higher inflation, highest deficit ever. CHAOS
4047 2018-12-24 03:52:34 Interviewer: "When you say grace kennedy you mean like the stocks ?"
Man: yeah stock up on bully beef and bread

4048 2018-12-24 03:52:28 Lol y’all really don’t need to pay anyone to learn how to invest in stocks. They finessing y’all out y’all money over some very simple shit you can learn on your own.
4049 2018-12-24 03:52:26 Buy more stocks.  They don't add it to the economy.  If you work 40 he's a week you should take have to live pay to pay. 2/2
4050 2018-12-24 03:52:11 Actually, he is correct.  You are all laughing stocks
4051 2018-12-24 03:51:12 Asian stocks were mostly lower with light trading on Monday as a Wall Street slump and a partial U.S. government shutdown stemmed holiday cheer.
4052 2018-12-24 03:51:11 False. My check went up a lot. Stocks are down because the fed keeps raising interests rates. The head a GM is a leftist. What other tricks do y’all have up your sleeve?
4053 2018-12-24 03:51:09 There is a unique buy signal in stocks. This signal will be confirmed in few days. 

There could be many such signals in a major bear market accompanied by a severe recession/bubble. At that time we use it as guidance. But when it happens outside bear (like now), it can be bottom
4054 2018-12-24 03:50:24 I know. If I was a tech company I would have used all the buy back money and cheap financing on completely new R&D. Some small companies probably did and will be awesome growth stocks in a few years.
4055 2018-12-24 03:49:48 They probably think that without bump stocks we don’t need semi-automatic firearms.
4056 2018-12-24 03:49:36 Watching my girls play Guess Who today, thinking about a grown up version:
“Does your person have a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds?”
“Has your person regularly changed the oil in their car?”
“Does your person feel guilty about not sleeping 7 hours per night regularly?”
4057 2018-12-24 03:49:03 Expect a possible dip in Nifty. Unable to sustain 10800 in morning. Classic short signs.

4062 2018-12-24 03:45:54 I think there's a bigger point which we miss because we are so used to  absurdity. If he can ruin the market with a stupid statement, that means  the market is a bubble propped up on nothing but positive thoughts. If  the stocks had real underlying value, this wouldn't matter.

4069 2018-12-24 03:41:45 if the banks are all invested in stocks and all the stocks have tanked, Mnuchin is hoping they currently have cash to turn over to loans or their individual clients like me/you. I think thats what it might mean. Sign of trouble ahead.

4071 2018-12-24 03:40:24 It's incomprehensible. Is he shorting stocks?

4084 2018-12-24 03:31:14 Loaded into a 4 player smash in Smash Ultimate. Everybody, but me had 3 stocks. I apparently only had two. Which I learned when I tried to Haduken with Ken but he did the Tatsumaki Senpukyaku instead and I self destructed.
4085 2018-12-24 03:30:58 Adjacent to his right hand....that box looks light, box below it has a lid that shows signs of little or no weight on top...puffy?
4086 2018-12-24 03:30:46 Even with 2 stocks, Smash 4 was still slow paced tbh.
4087 2018-12-24 03:30:28 think about it, why would anyone need to sell stocks this week into the new year? lol. zero selling liquidity and complacent bears - rip,roaring short squeeze
4088 2018-12-24 03:29:21 What the is happening exactly? How do you have 3 different character stocks?
4089 2018-12-24 03:29:02 Maybe. I think all this market volatility is intentional because insiders are short-selling stocks ahead of all these "mistakes". They're siphoning off our 401Ks into this abyss of stupid...
4090 2018-12-24 03:28:45 Did you ever calculated the consequences of free agriculture market?

Then the price of produce will fluctuate like Group Z & X stocks of BSE and it'll be impossible for commoners to purchase them...!
4091 2018-12-24 03:28:39  Lies, Lies, Lies.  Must be buying fallen stocks?  Being on the inside us such a profit bubble?
4092 2018-12-24 03:28:29 Great article! Having traded the sector since the Nov 2016 rally, I am finally coming to realize your theory is correct. I have seen cannabis stocks rise & fall too many times to count. Good news doesn’t send the sector soaring as it used to while bad news sends it plummeting.
4093 2018-12-24 03:28:19 REALLY think we need 4 stocks. I feel like these games swing SO fast. We've already seen people come back from stock disadvantages, but that extra stock would make things more dynamic IMO.
4094 2018-12-24 03:28:15 futures up but $es_f needs 2441 2454 to be better - gonna be very hard. tech stocks premiums SUPER HIGH. if mkt bounce after another dive, might see tech leaders up big. $amzn 1353 1334 are two key support levels. IF dive and supported, not impossible to see 1433 or even 1476.

4103 2018-12-24 03:22:07 Hi Kaitlin. If we enact common sense gun laws and ban bump stocks, people who have passed thorough background checks and a waiting period should be able to use firearms for defensive reasons, while the lives of children, adults, and everyone in between will be saved.
4104 2018-12-24 03:21:08 I don't pretend to know what is happening with gasoline, but I am observing every tick+weirdo thing w this mkt - the spread to HO has narrowed a lot, thanks to less stuff coming to PADD 1b,+ F is going out strong+funds like it.  But stocks are very high...................and.....
4105 2018-12-24 03:21:07 Banning bump stocks don’t make us any safer because any semi auto can be bumbfired with your finger and a belt loop. Infringement for no reason through and through. Donald Trump restricted the 2nd more than Obama. @ me if you want to
4106 2018-12-24 03:18:43 So many options:
1. T: "I need people to freak about the shutdown so we can get Dems to cave. I miss FL!"

2. Someone doesn't want their loan rates 

3. Jared: "I shorted stocks! Let's have some fun!"

4. T: "Stupid Mattis coverage!"
M: "Hold my beer"
4107 2018-12-24 03:17:01 I zoomed in. Looks like Mr. Schorn leaned in and moved the top boxes. I see a caved in box touching his shoulder. Weight should have left no gaps between bottom case and the next up. What an "X" vs "/"?  I think those are empty cases. I could be wrong.

4142 2018-12-24 03:00:34 Bitcoin is only 10 years old. It’s still a highly speculative asset class.

If the greater market fails, most will liquidate risky $crypto to cover loses in stocks by hunkering down into  conservative SoVs like gold or bonds.

With enough time, $BTC will become the fallback.

4145 2018-12-24 02:58:46 Also, why is @NRA supporting a ban on bump stocks?
4146 2018-12-24 02:58:29 Seems like Powell is on his way out shortly! Time to dump all your stocks! It’s going to be a bloodbath!
4147 2018-12-24 02:57:57 What the fuck lol that's extreme
Had someone with 3-stocks and 3min try to get in sudden death
4148 2018-12-24 02:57:06 Ok going to give this a whirl. Bought $BTC $4,000. I don’t have any price predictions as I feel are all null and void with $btc purely speculation. I think investors move money from stocks to alternatives in next 6 months.
4149 2018-12-24 02:56:53 Where is the liquidity crisis coming from? Banks are fine. The stocks were far from cheap cash. This is insanity. Forget it, jake. It’s Chinatown.
4150 2018-12-24 02:56:06 One other thing. I was venturing I ng the stock market the other day...and taking a hit. Well, I noticed that the stocks on my investments were falling at the same rates in that category. Well,..., either the Bull was out of the Corral...or someone was rigging the market.
4151 2018-12-24 02:54:05 Andre had 13/15 and SEVEN stocks in under 30 minutes... because Zaza.. played the entire fourth quarter... and it sorta worked?

blergh
4152 2018-12-24 02:53:38 bec today is the release, meaning they only got the stocks now even ygselect
4153 2018-12-24 02:48:47 Volatility is a long-term investors best friend. 'Investors' BUY when fearful 'Traders' SELL. Use your liquid positions to accumulate more of quality stocks at such intervals. Cheer up, It's Xmas Sale on the bourses.
4154 2018-12-24 02:48:00 Signs of a bear market are stocks opening strong and finishing weak, we’ve had a decent number of those so far.
4155 2018-12-24 02:47:34 He's going to try and force the Fed to take the 50 Bs and put it all in stocks to prop up the market.
4156 2018-12-24 02:46:18 I am so sick of people revisionist when it comes to these people’s intent and ignorance. 

If your 401K, stocks and white privilege are more important to you than simple decency then I have no fucking use for you.

Remorse? Well I’ll take your vote but baby, keep it moving.
4157 2018-12-24 02:45:46 Asian stocks trade with a caution. Japan Market is shut on Account of Emperor’s birthday
4158 2018-12-24 02:45:33 CLSA sees consensus EPS to be revised downwards for most auto stocks
4159 2018-12-24 02:45:28 Yeah, stocks going to explode! (But not by grenades)
4160 2018-12-24 02:45:20 Ya I just checked in from the craps table all day. Merry Christmas. Just wish everyone was here to bring everyone up... not down. That’s the problem with stocks on twitter.
4161 2018-12-24 02:45:00 every time i read an article about how how the stock market's tanking i get a little happy to think of all the money rich people are losing but then i remember that all my savings are in stocks so i'm fucked too
4162 2018-12-24 02:44:16 o sige mag snitch tayo sa stocks ni papi bitoy ng joy with safeguard para kewl
4163 2018-12-24 02:43:02 Then there's me, crying as I dig my nails into smash4 2 stocks system. I will not be changed 
4164 2018-12-24 02:42:02 ...and they completely collapsed over the next 3 weeks.

The EU currently has a ban on shorting EU bank stocks, how's that working out...
4165 2018-12-24 02:42:00 Just in case you were too busy tweeting or watching tv or enjoying your second scoop of ice cream (such a lucky boy), the economy is slowing and stocks are tanking.  It appears that these are as a direct result of your policies, statements & actions. A resignation seems overdue.
4166 2018-12-24 02:41:28 But they aren't "ho hum" about stocks, they are just slightly above historical levels based on earnings. Which was the point. Seems to me this in reversion to the mean, which has anyways been inevitable
4167 2018-12-24 02:40:43 I would like see you fired Maxine, you showed us what financial decisions you are willing make when you bailed your husbands stocks out with Obama stimulus funding.
4168 2018-12-24 02:40:11 What does your chinese spy think about bump stocks?
4169 2018-12-24 02:40:02 I was hoping Mnuchin would at least clue us in on what stocks to buy on Monday...lol!
4170 2018-12-24 02:39:32 The only thing that peeves me off more than the little zoom in happening and your opponent not dying, is when an opponent dies and there was no zoom in at all. I specifically take stocks FOR the zoom in. I LIVE FOR THE ZOOM IN!

4177 2018-12-24 02:31:45 Everyone knows how one-sided/ rigged the markets have become. Expressing concern in this way, they are admitting they have lost control of the rigging. 1987 Portfolio Insurance ring a bell?  In 2008 Bernanke saw no problems? Or 1929 when JP Morgan publically bot stocks?
4178 2018-12-24 02:30:44 Good answer, fake NRA guy. But I already responded. 

Now why don't you be a good boy and turn in your bump stocks. Because that's what Trump wants.
4179 2018-12-24 02:30:36 RT nmgreen57: this man JhbTeam is a top 5 twitter account rn rising in the stocks 
4180 2018-12-24 02:29:40 Outlook for today 24.12.18 markets will be sideways. Not much of action in absence of #FIIs. Beaten down stocks might correct. Let's see #Trump shutdown already factored in or some more pain left. #crude and #GSTRateCut positive for our markets.
4181 2018-12-24 02:26:52 what will he do when stocks's drop get really large, say another 15% from here?

4184 2018-12-24 02:23:20 They were so fun! I still don’t know how you beat me when I was up 4 stocks at 15 to your 2 stocks? That game I didn’t even mess up, you just completely flipped it somehow!? You’re a true Leg! 
4185 2018-12-24 02:22:29 How many stocks did you buy your kids for Christmas or better yet did you open up a portfolio for them?
4186 2018-12-24 02:22:25 I used to wonder why my parent slept very little when I was a kid. My love for sleep keeps dropping like stocks by the day.
4187 2018-12-24 02:20:31 Stocks may be plummeting but you can always invest in me...I  promise I never disappoint!
4188 2018-12-24 02:18:25 He knows how to get the conpany he probably owns a ton of stocks in all the government contracts.
4189 2018-12-24 02:16:29 I did a tour in AF. Have been a DOD Contractor. 
I once spoke with a guy that was a Reserve man and he said he wasn't really in the army. Did a tour in Iraq. I said you were in some firefights and some of your buddies got hit did they? "Yep."     He's a vet!
4190 2018-12-24 02:16:22 Oh, Happy Holidays from the Fed...

4192 2018-12-24 02:13:56 It's the arrest of Sabrina Meng of Huawei that has them spooked. This isn't just a you made a bad deal with Iran sanctions. This is espionage and patent infringement. Combine that with the Tech stocks that are all heavily dependent with their markets? Then the hackers? It's FUBAR
4193 2018-12-24 02:13:17 It’s illegal for them to buy stocks.  Govt is too stupid to orchestrate a cover up 100% of the time.
4194 2018-12-24 02:10:45 You could add the values of all stocks at the start and end of each year or period, and compare that to the deficits. But of course there's lots of places for new debt to infect the economy, so that wouldn't be entirely fair.
4195 2018-12-24 02:08:02 They said invest in stocks, now that you have some money to spare. It will be a good investment, they said. I followed that advice in September 2018. They called it a good investment, I call it (with the benefit of hindsight) the worst deal I’ve made in my life.
4196 2018-12-24 02:07:37 Sa mga inaanak ko kita kits bukas 1st come 1st serve lang ah limited stocks tayo ngayon tagutom si ninang nyo walang trabaho mahirap pa sa daga kaya pagpasensyahan nyo na ang ampao na may lamang tunataginting na isang daan  Di ako magtatago dahil mahal ko kayo 
4197 2018-12-24 02:06:23 Trump - Mattis

I have had gutsful of left leaning media not telling truth.

POTUS must Order Mattis to tell public truth.

Mattis should.

As for Schumer, his "temper tantrum" remark is contempt of Office of President = Jail

401K's
Stocks down 4,000 PTS
Dem's have cost public $
4198 2018-12-24 02:05:55 Any shareholder dividends derived from the “tax bill” last year are practically used up. It’s unsustainable. Like I said before, we cashed out and will move back in when things are total shit. Buy low, sell high. Stocks 101
4199 2018-12-24 02:04:46 Yes, exactly but in this case there was a quick jump (which is not rare but a bit of a pain). So it is to but I'd argue the patterns are more flagging, and frankly we are seeing way too much volatility to put a lot of faith in anything right now. Has helped on some single stocks
4200 2018-12-24 02:04:04 I 100% agree. Three stocks also gives me a whole other chance to use rage as a heavy and that feels very good.
4201 2018-12-24 02:03:51 We just need the prez to tell us stocks are cheap, and I’m all in...

4203 2018-12-24 02:03:42 Not to mention Trump and his criminal kids could be shorting stocks and making millions by spooking the markets and we’d never know because Trump never divested and his finances are a total black box.
4204 2018-12-24 02:02:44 OMG Leah! I think you’re on to something. Who’s shorting stocks right now?
4205 2018-12-24 02:02:18 Just did my first quickplay match in Smash today.  Was a 2v2, three stocks each.

I was Link, Villager teammate.  Against a Bayonetta and Richter.

Villager died REAL quick.  Became a 2v1 from then on.  I don't know how, but I managed to pull it off.
4206 2018-12-24 02:02:09 I'm so happy with 3 stocks in Ultimate. I hated 2 stocks with a burning passion. Oh you SD once or get footstooled at 0%? Well, now the game is half over. God bless Ultimate.
4207 2018-12-24 02:01:43 Time sucks lol 5 stocks for life
4208 2018-12-24 02:00:07 My position on bump stocks is that they are a gimmick, for gimmicky shooters who wannabe super operator operators. I wouldn't own one on a bet. 
What I do care about is Who makes gun laws. It's Congress's job, not cabinet level Departments. That's the issue here. Who.
4209 2018-12-24 01:59:13 As if I have one. Why would I need one?  Why would you think I have one? What you do with your stocks or money is none of my business. Perhaps you should hire a broker?
4210 2018-12-24 01:58:51 i'm so behind on Facebook stocks.. i would be beyond excite if they plunge down fast like to $30 so i can invest.... only a wish lol

4212 2018-12-24 01:58:26 All candidates will have to pass FBI background checks BEFORE the election or they can't even be on the ballot. Plus, they must fully divest of ALL stocks and business investments not just putting them in a bogus trust.
4213 2018-12-24 01:56:49 Don't short stocks here. The time was Naz high 7000s ... greed here not to close out that short.
4214 2018-12-24 01:55:44 We can invest that money in science, education and our broken health system that's what we really need at this time instead a wall, I don't think the wall it's a stupid idea but it's too much money.The president doesn't need to shutdown the government, our stocks are in a slump.
4215 2018-12-24 01:55:34 Bernie what are you gonna do to change it.  As I see it this stock market crash is just another theft of wealth from the middle class to the rich when they buy up more shares at a steep discount.  Can’t imagine how manny people sold their stocks at a loss for fear of more loss...
4216 2018-12-24 01:54:52 Tfw the game is balanced and zero cant down throw up air for 3 stocks LOL
4217 2018-12-24 01:54:37 Thanks for the INSIDER TRADER information Steve! I'll pull out of stocks ASAP!

Your the best!
4218 2018-12-24 01:54:14 Question from a friend: Teacher, no stocks, a little money in the bank. After this thread & watching It’s a Wonderful Life again, she thinks we should all get our $$ out of the bank first thing tomorrow. Good plan??@paulkrugman @matthewjdowd
4219 2018-12-24 01:53:26 niabot na akong stocks Yeeeeey
4220 2018-12-24 01:48:03 At least I took down 3 stocks as King K vs. Dark samus.  I was king K
4221 2018-12-24 01:47:40 Yeah it’s a big “DEAL” for you to sign the Farm Bill, it opens up a profit margin for you, political corporate cronies like Boehner creating marijuana shell companies, cultivating weed investing in stocks related to cannabis & put up a wall to cut off MEX exporting their “crops”.
4222 2018-12-24 01:47:30 It’s a falsehood bump stocks, still one trigger pull one round fired
4223 2018-12-24 01:47:17 The Fed has no mandate to increase stock prices. If you wanna sell stocks down here don’t blame the Fed.
4224 2018-12-24 01:47:11 They outright banned short selling of financial stocks
4225 2018-12-24 01:46:27 For the first time in over two years the S&P traded slightly below my calculation of "fair market value" (2450) on Friday - many stocks are now more meaningfully undervalued
I might be wrong but I think independently, I am transparent and I am willing to go outside of consensus
4226 2018-12-24 01:46:08 There are absolutely no indications of a banking crisis! This is a garden variety bear market in stocks, albeit a nasty one. Some parts of the credit markets have slumped too, but not to the extent that banks face systemic risks like they did in 2008.
4227 2018-12-24 01:45:36 @sainsburys I'm on the hunt for a local branch that stocks Clamato juice, (I've only ordered it from you online before). I'm in Farnham, Surrey. Thanks! 
4228 2018-12-24 01:42:45 STOCKS ARE STILL AVAILABLE FOR LOVE AND SHOT VERSION.

Love - 2 slots
Shot - 3 slots

• Same price as my Batch 1: P830.
• Same time of arrival as Batch 1 too.
• DOP: Jan 5, 11pm
• w/ PC and Poster pooling

DM for sure buyers only :)
4229 2018-12-24 01:42:06 But real long-term interest rates are still unusually low by historical standards, so things overall aren’t in a normal place. For some reason people love bonds but are ho-hum about stocks.
4230 2018-12-24 01:41:44 Stocks a derivative of corporate health and discount factors largely external to equities over time. You can lose bond market but stocks less sensitive to whouse weirdness
4231 2018-12-24 01:41:09 No. I don’t invest in precious metals but I do have a fairly high risk tolerance. I’m invested in small,mid & large cap funds as well as healthcare & biotech. But right now, everything is doing poorly. Let’s consider it a sale in stocks
4232 2018-12-24 01:40:07 Yes. I’m settled into my new home/city/job/family and with all this markets in turmoil shenanigans I just couldn’t stay away any longer.
4233 2018-12-24 01:38:27 Multiple sources confirm the NRAs position on bump stocks came to little to late
4234 2018-12-24 01:38:21 he probably shorted a ton of stocks
4235 2018-12-24 01:36:15 BUY THE FEAR tomorrow !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Because THE GREED HAS ALREADY BEEN SOLD !!!!!!

Time to start adding stocks in small increments to existing holdings or create new holdings.  Don't add crazy amounts in one move.  We have hit the bottom now, IMHO.
4236 2018-12-24 01:34:41 Yes you're right. You see all the media and Democrats  talking about recession. However they shouldn't forget that Obama said this is his economy so it will be his recession if we have one. But don't think we will have one. Stocks are still up 5000 more than Obama
4237 2018-12-24 01:33:37 Stock Market 

Crypto/Bitcoin

Probably going to really start day trading crypto currency again. While also looking for stocks that are on sale and will boom again soon.
4238 2018-12-24 01:33:22 Yes Trump used money from his stocks to pay for his campaign and not from the NRA.
 Ay Hillary used some funds from a special account that her and other people have and I am not at liberty to tell anyone.
Plus the media is trying to get Trump out of office by lying to us all.
4239 2018-12-24 01:32:14 This does not happen so much in forex and stocks, since the money you need to manipulate patterns is a lot more due to the higher liquidity
4240 2018-12-24 01:30:47 if stocks go up (later that day): Mnuchin is an idiot, doesn't understand markets, and created panic that didn't exist
4241 2018-12-24 01:30:36 a lot of us think we're safe.  we dont have stocks or enuff to retire on but as long as SS and medical survive - we will.
i have the VA
4242 2018-12-24 01:30:21 I wonder which stocks he and his buddies have shorted for monday?
Thieves!
4243 2018-12-24 01:30:12 No, Donnie made bump stocks illegal, remember?
4244 2018-12-24 01:28:52 I’ve been pretty much just trading /YM and /ES last two weeks, long and short.  And making more money than I was trading stocks.  Just scalping away.
4245 2018-12-24 01:28:44 My stocks have been going up :)) Mexico will pay for some of wall indirectly-did you see the go fund me page for wall??
4246 2018-12-24 01:28:43 The hookers in the briefcase, not the buy stocks part
4247 2018-12-24 01:28:36 Sorry.  I may trust Mnuchin to produce Wonder Woman but think i may pull my money out of stocks Monday.
4248 2018-12-24 01:27:47 Monday, Monday, can´t trust that day
Monday, Monday, sometimes it just turns out that way

4249 2018-12-24 01:27:10 The decline began, when Buffet bought more apple over 200$ a share.  Without doing his homework. The saturation point of cell phones, and the pricing of their new phones . Now the inflated non sense stocks are being demolished.  Five Below, Wayfair, Ollies , the list gets bigger
4250 2018-12-24 01:26:37 No government, rampant racism, gun violence gone wild, crashing stocks....Mexico might build a wall and make the US pay for it.
4251 2018-12-24 01:26:34 You haven’t made money in stocks the last two years?? That’s your faulty stock picking. Quit using Antifa Financial Advisors! I could give a  who pays for it as long as it go’s up.  All your 6th grade kool aid comments aren’t going to convert me to your dark side.

4254 2018-12-24 01:24:23 Is it me, or does it seem like trump is trying to manipulate certain companies stocks by making comments he shouldn’t be making in public? Could it be for financial gain for him and his cronies?
4255 2018-12-24 01:24:09 And I’m wondering how much of Trump’s insanity is already priced into Asian stocks. I’m not an efficient-markets advocate, but it’s not as if we would’ve been surprised by this all that much in April 2017.
4256 2018-12-24 01:23:47 you really out here playing 2 stocks huh

4259 2018-12-24 01:22:45 Banks will lend you money to buy properties or start/boost a business BUT won't lend you money to buy their stocks/shares. That's uncertainty right there.

Get in here and let me show you the real investment deal.
4260 2018-12-24 01:22:44 i think i lost neutral a total of 10 times during all 6 stocks yet i got 0-2d by the krool ajdjwiwjwnw
4261 2018-12-24 01:22:11 I had stocks long-term and now they’re tanking. I’m penny-pinching when I should be relaxing this Christmas. No presents  under no tree this year.
4262 2018-12-24 01:21:55 If we dropped under $1k I would be looking at weed stocks for 2019 it would be bad news for crypto, I can’t see the market movers doing anything detrimental with the amount $ being spent on new on-ramps, binance killed last year NYSE & Nasdaq want a piece of that.
4263 2018-12-24 01:20:47 Stocks have been in a TEN YEAR bull market. Many traders/investors have never seen a bear. Good luck in the coming years lol.

4264 2018-12-24 01:20:35 One of the most promising and successful projects. This is  good news to hear that the crypto exchanges are scoring over stocks. Go Go Go...!!!  #stockmarket #cryptoexchange #tradeio #cfd #fxtrading
4265 2018-12-24 01:20:35 stocks go down: Mnuchin is an idiot, doesn't understand markets, and created panic that didn't exist

stocks go up: Mnuchin is smart, market savy, and ended the panic

4268 2018-12-24 01:20:00 You’d think, with all this Brexit stuff going on, that British stocks would be tanking. But no. We’re doing OK. Meanwhile, the USA, with their stable genius Ivy League educated president, well their stocks are falling like a stone.

I’m sure @realDonaldTrump can explain this 
4269 2018-12-24 01:18:44 Socialism is an economic system while communism is both an economic and political system. ... Socialists can own personal properties while communists can not. Socialism allows capitalism to exist in its midst while communism seeks to get rid of capitalism.

You can own stocks.
4270 2018-12-24 01:18:08 Hello, I am  grekko with a quick news update. The Democrats are pushing legislation that could impact the future shares of  TM stocks. Thank you for tuning into  CNN.
4271 2018-12-24 01:17:55 I have done it in the past with some quality stocks. Due to market conditions I am short and long

4276 2018-12-24 01:13:31 I am so close to short the same stocks I am long 
4277 2018-12-24 01:12:12 Remember last year ~ 90 days ago  when people were begging for a sell off in #stockmarket because they missed #TrumpRally.  45  a winner,  then it all goes away. #Stocks @CNBC, “Not enough Supply of Equities due to buybacks.”LOL #S&P PT 2100. Winter is coming
4278 2018-12-24 01:10:46 The blue and red stars on the graph refer to UK ascension to the EU and the beginning of quota management under the EU Common Fisheries Policy.

That same fall occurred in other fishing nations too. *Declining stocks*
4279 2018-12-24 01:10:28 i buy stocks on tweets like this
4280 2018-12-24 01:10:08 Mark my words too, stocks will soon be reliant on social media

4282 2018-12-24 01:08:12 Overfishing, diminishing stocks and the 1976 cod war, that the UK lost.

The decline started around 1910 not the mid 70s.
4283 2018-12-24 01:07:36 financial markets are full of sheeple needing confidence, who might bail on stocks en masse, is my guess
4284 2018-12-24 01:07:19 You have lost my support. You constantly give in to gun grabbing politicians, not challenging them when they clearly infringe upon our rights, which is what we pay you to help us fight. Today they got bump stocks, next year ar15s then everything. Only criminals will be armed. Thx
4285 2018-12-24 01:07:01 Q367: Stocks trader? (7)
4286 2018-12-24 01:06:36 This drop was perfectly crafted. Perfect time for the powers that be to lull investors & pull the rug around holidays. When @CNBC tells you to buy the dip and Steve Mnuchin pretends to chat with top bankers to avoid a collapse, run. No more #rigged #StockMarket #DowJones #stocks

4291 2018-12-24 01:04:33 Is he gonna ask them to buy stocks again or else?
4292 2018-12-24 01:03:33 No- nor should they be worried- banks (companies not the stocks near term) are pretty healthy and regulations have thankfully kept them from doing extremely stupid crap in massive quantities. Doubt they will thank Tarullo but they should.
4293 2018-12-24 01:01:55 How about Can't Short the FANG-MAN stocks.  That would work.

I remember that 2008 there was a rule: "no shorts for the Banks stocks"
4294 2018-12-24 01:01:00 Funny how you had not shit to say about it when stocks were up, companies giving employees bonuses and pay raises all the way up till a month ago... shut up

We need Trump and Xi in a handshake agreement telecast to the whole world !!!

That will send stocks up 10% !!

Powell, wall, shutdown etc....all are noise variables!!!

4301 2018-12-24 00:52:55 I’ll be enjoying the doubling of the standard deduction and additional child tax credit. And I’ll get more profit sharing from my company and buy more stocks at a discount thanks.
4302 2018-12-24 00:51:37 All politics aside why are people politicizing one of the best opportunities of a life time? You should have a job for insurance, savings to buy highly discounted stocks and a home to take advantage of falling mortgage rates. #stockmarketcrash
4303 2018-12-24 00:50:12 Think many have been surprised with the market. See CDEV, NBL,.. the while sector. Not being acquired does not mean, didn’t make a target. I had a decent thesis and have been wrong about the market. Having a thesis exposes us to being wrong. Not a lot of people can move stocks.
4304 2018-12-24 00:50:10 Less food stocks, specialisation, and decreased oxygen content in the oceans
4305 2018-12-24 00:49:59 I'm not scared one bit.  This has been great for me as I'm hedged and just have to outperform the market.  Getting some stocks ridiculously cheap and how do you know for certain any of those things will be resolved.
4306 2018-12-24 00:48:21 Monday is a half session closing at 1p EsT. Tuesday market closed. The rest of the week usual hours, but after the Friday volume surge on options expiration, many will be gone for the week meaning less people to sell stocks

4308 2018-12-24 00:45:19 Really What Goes Up must inevitably come back down - most sane markets move in stair step increment - from an elliot wave point of view weve been in an extended 5th wave - this actually had to happen most stocks are to expensive and trading at ridiculous levels to earnings
4309 2018-12-24 00:44:38 @FoxNewsSunday how much Boeing stock or other porltential conflict of interest stocks does he own
4310 2018-12-24 00:43:57 He should! Do you look forward to Stock Market opening tomorrow? He’s a paid hit man by DNC. We are so tired of the tyranny. No indicators call for this dip in Stocks. I would fire his ass and put someone in there Trump trusts! Dems must be stopped! Ruining country!
4311 2018-12-24 00:43:34 Holiday week with many traders  off , market is way over sold ,, technicals  didn't matter last week ,,, for spx stocks ,, look at these numbers  ,,2% spx stocks  over  10 day MA ,,7 % spx stocks over 50 day MA ,,, 17 % spx stocks over 200 day MA ,, monster up move setting up
4312 2018-12-24 00:43:18 Hurry. Buy Boeing stocks.  You scratch my corporate back and I’ll scratch your.  Do these people think outside their pocketbooks?
4313 2018-12-24 00:42:36 semi-literate!!!!!  Yes, in any decently ordered society, people who don't read should be held in stocks and pelted with rotting material.  Of course, in contemporary Britain, it's something to be celebrated with a celeb culture.
4314 2018-12-24 00:42:11 Donald hasn't proven to be too sharp sharp at managing money. Unless he's shorted bank stocks.
4315 2018-12-24 00:40:04 @jaketapper Hey Jake question how has Pres. Trump made your life worse? I mean you complain and guest complain but really like to know how has he made your life worse? Did you lose job, house, family, stocks etc. Exactly what? Like to know. Because I loss a lot under Obama.
4316 2018-12-24 00:39:55 Stock market is still up 4,400 points since Trump was elected.

Don't fall for Democrat talking points put out by the media.

How many years til you need the money? Always look at a down stock market as prices on discount...it's a sale...it's time to buy when stocks come down.
4317 2018-12-24 00:39:54 Margin calls is what crashes market. The fed waits for debt to margin ratio go thru the roof then they pull the fuqing rug out. Stocks sell off below margin calls and people are forced into selling
4318 2018-12-24 00:39:03 Markets, NZD/JPY Brace for Illiquidity Post US Government Shutdown: Wall Street had its worst week in over seven years as the US government headed for partial shutdown. Asia stocks brace for illiquidity, House failed to agree on budget over the weekend.
4319 2018-12-24 00:38:38 And find out who started selling them on Fri. Did they know this was coming? Seems to happen a lot that conversations are had, trades done, prior to statements made that effect market or specific stocks.
4320 2018-12-24 00:38:25 Tech stocks doing pretty bad. I wonder what will happen with crypto when there is the rebound.
4321 2018-12-24 00:37:45 J'aime grave les gens qui ont jamais porté un altere de leur vie et qui lâche des "vOuS VoUs piQUeZ " aux mecs bien stocks. Qui es tu ? Utilise ta tête avant d'utiliser ta grande gorge
4322 2018-12-24 00:37:32 Fell pretty bad yesterday at the skatepark, couldn’t stand back up initially, I was like whatever. Chillin on the floor is coo. First thing I thought of was the amount of stocks I had? Which was one, and it was in the floor, me. 
Don’t take your stocks for granted, not even one
4323 2018-12-24 00:37:27 Its true, no more bump stocks. Please google. Trump and the Republicans are taking them away.

Sad.
4324 2018-12-24 00:37:19 How come they are ok with the ban on bump stocks and a ban on 3D printed guns?
4325 2018-12-24 00:36:15 Fuck. This is why I don't like to own individual stocks. I should have sold that mf the first time Kaplan's name appeared in the news.
4326 2018-12-24 00:35:16 The only solid thing I just heard was that Repubs have finally outlawed bump stocks. I’m sure there was pressure to do so.
4327 2018-12-24 00:34:37 And I can think of four 60+ people without having to think hard whose main concerns about what the government is doing are almost completely encompassed by it affects how much their taxes are and how their stocks are doing.

4329 2018-12-24 00:32:02 More researchers of statistical correlation than @PikettyLeMonde will disagree entirely with that statement. Perhaps 20% of the stock holders take 80% of the profits but it is still very much a majority profitability venture to own stocks in a stock market, especially index fund.
4330 2018-12-24 00:30:57 The only redeeming part of this market downturn is the hilarious irony that big oil backed trump like mad and oil stocks are at a 15 week low.

4333 2018-12-24 00:29:01 I do the three job thing, too!  Travis does Twitch FT and GDQ.  

IRA’s and HSA with your 401k’s help!  Look into to P2P lending like street shares and REIT like Fundrise to diversify your stocks with some more stable returns.
4334 2018-12-24 00:28:46 In a bear market, even strong stocks get hit and head lower.
4335 2018-12-24 00:28:30 Because in a raging bull market, even crap stocks tend to push higher.
4336 2018-12-24 00:28:06 true joy is finding a pair of size LONG pants on a clearance rack in a store that stocks tons of short sizes but refuses to believe that tall women exist outside of online shopping
4337 2018-12-24 00:27:06 Manipulated Price Drops are often created by High-Frequency Traders (HFTs).
•They trigger panic selling on otherwise strong stocks, then buy them back before they rebound for consistent profits.
4338 2018-12-24 00:25:03 My focus is on trading stocks and securing the bag for myself and true friends!
4339 2018-12-24 00:24:43 Secular trends remain intact for stocks like Adobe and Nvidia. Wouldn’t it be wide for long term (2-3 years) focused mid-30s ppl such as me go focus on trends and start buying @jimcramer (congrats on the big win today btw)

4342 2018-12-24 00:23:59 @RandPaul we must do something about the federal reserve. Why are we letting a private banker control our economy? Stocks in free fall. 401k in the toilet. Free market.
4343 2018-12-24 00:21:12 I went stat fishing and have caught a Joey Hauser who seems to be one of the best shooters in the top 100 RSCI this season. Not a big enough sample to go crazy over but I’ll keep an eye on him. Assists are nice too, but his STOCKS are probably indicative of a guy who is not NBA.

4348 2018-12-24 00:15:56 classic - I saw articles "why I'm still buying AMZN" at 1800$ or so after first hits. I was waiting for stocks to fall so I was aware what is about to happen. I was shocked. It should be criminilized.

4351 2018-12-24 00:13:05 Guys stocks are down 15% from their high what should we do?

CALL THE BANKS AND SEE IF THEY ARE LIQUID
4352 2018-12-24 00:12:38 Moral hazard: after 9 yrs where stocks haven’t ONCE experienced losses >1% on a rolling 4-qtr basis, stocks are down JUST 7.9% YTD & people are losing their minds, media is having a conniption & Treasury is blasting out ‘don’t panic’ letters.

Powell was right to hike IMO.
4353 2018-12-24 00:12:16  US shuts down stocks
4354 2018-12-24 00:12:13 In other words, we should sell all our stocks as quickly as possible before you and Trump grind them into pennies.
4355 2018-12-24 00:11:05 Depressing. The Southern Pacific fish stocks are being decimated by massive factory ships from the northern hemisphere. First saw it at work in American Samoa in 1988. Harvesting, not farming.

4357 2018-12-24 00:07:55 Why are we letting a private banker control our economy? All political. Stocks in free fall. 401k in the toilet. They print worthless paper and change us interest to use it. End the fed.
4358 2018-12-24 00:05:31 I like to think Jamie Dimon and the rest literally laughed at Mnuchin calling them on the weekend before Christmas to check whether their liquidity is fine just because stocks are down in Dec.
4359 2018-12-24 00:05:13 No wonder the stocks are tanking. China is being purged. America was addicted. Our country needs to resolve the shutdown and the market, fast.

Fast as Ferrari's La Ferrari FXXK Evo.
4360 2018-12-24 00:05:02 Don’t invest in stocks, invest in limited edition, licensed cereals that you can resell for 3x shelf value on eBay
4361 2018-12-24 00:04:52 DEMOCRATS NO, MONEY FOR TRUMP’S WALL! We Americans want BIB CONCESSIONS ONLY. TRUMP WILL NOT GET 5 BILLION THAT IS TO MUCH! Democrats want BIG BIG CONCESSIONS IN WRITING! STOCKS PLUMMETING. Trump owns this SHUTDOWN! NO, MONEY FOR WALL.
4362 2018-12-24 00:04:27 A shutdown, falling stocks, lawsuits out the ass, admin in turmoil, Repubs in prison, FBI investigations, Corps leaving the country, and $891 billion and climbing deficit does not spell success! It’s really sad you don’t appear to know what’s going on. Did you go to college?
4363 2018-12-24 00:03:22 Stocks Selling has been always illegal

4365 2018-12-24 00:02:46 Invest in Nike stocks. It's $500 to get in
4366 2018-12-24 00:02:26 Stocks probably
4367 2018-12-24 00:01:43 In get that line of thinking, but given the sharp downward move in stocks and the credit contraction we are seeing, one has to wonder about forced liquidations and overall liquidity. I would not say it was for sure a bad move by mr secretary.
4368 2018-12-24 00:01:32 Fish stocks have plummeted on average by 60-70% since 1970, some fish stocks are 85-90% less than they were in 1970, we’re about to hit ecological meltdown if people don’t change their habits.
4369 2018-12-24 00:01:24 More dangerous than 10 years of QE and asset inflation?  Doubtful!  It’s the responsible thing to do even if stocks go down.  Who cares-nobody can handle life and it’s realities!
4370 2018-12-24 00:01:01 @tmore1 by far my worst luck yet trading stocks
